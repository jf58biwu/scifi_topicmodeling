 BOY : Ever since I was three , I wanted to play quarterback for the New York Giants ... like my personal hero , Eli Manning . Annual salary is between 10 and 20 million dollars a year . MR. KENNY : Thank you . Next up ... Reed . Mr. Richards ? Earth to Richards . ( SIMULATES STATIC ) Beam me up , Scotty . ( KIDS GIGGLING ) MR. KENNY : Okay , come on , guys . Oh , I 'm sorry . When I grow up ... I want to be the first person in human history to teleport himself . ( KIDS LAUGHING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) I 'm sorry , what ? It 's already possible to transport quantum information from one location to another . Right now , there are supercomputers that can transport Quantum information through space . So why not a machine that can send people through space ? Well , even if you could build the thing , which you can 't ... I 've already built it . Well , I 'm building it . In my garage . Is it next to your flying car ? ( LAUGHING ) I 'm not working on that anymore . Just this now . I call it a " Biomatter Shuttle . " " Biomatter ... " ? Technically , I 'm shuttling matter from one place to another . Well , first matter . But once I test on biological materials , I can ... All right , look ... Thank you , Mr. Richards . This is all very interesting but the assignment was to pick a real career in the real world . Redo the report , and I 'll let you try again tomorrow . ( SCATTERED LAUGHTER ) Ben ? ( MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( DOG BARKING ) JIMMY : Anyway , I tell him ... " Bro , I ain 't looking at your girl . " Girl 's looking at me . " What you want me to do about it ? " Know what I 'm saying ? Hey , where you going ? I got homework . What ? Look at that fridge pile . ( SOFTLY ) Idiot . What 'd you say ? Hey ! Clobbering time . ( GROANS ) What 'd you think ? Think you can talk to me like that , huh ? You think you can talk to me like that , punk ? BEN 'S MOTHER : What the hell is the matter with you ? Shh ! Huh ? Huh ? Ma ! I didn 't do nothing ! Huh ? Huh ? Ma , I swear to God ! You didn 't do nothing ? ( DOGS BARKING ) Go check on that fuss . You didn 't do nothing ? I watched you ! What 's the matter with you ? How many times do I have to tell you , you don 't hit a kid ! ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) ( DOGS CONTINUE BARKING ) Hey ! ( WHINING ) Hello ? Who 's in there ? Please don 't kill me . Take that off . I know you . From school . I 'm just looking for a power converter . I 'm building something . BEN 'S MOTHER : Ben ! What 's going on out there ? Hold on ! That teleporting thing ? I can show it to you . I just need the converter . All right . MR. RICHARDS : Come on , throw him the ball ! MR. RICHARDS : Throw the ball , throw the ball ! ( INDISTINCT TV CHATTER ) Come on , he 's open ! Throw the ball ! ( LOCK CLICKS ) MR. RICHARDS : That 's what I 'm talking about . Yeah ! Is that it ? Yeah . Help . ( GRUNTS ) ( ELECTRICITY BUZZING ) Here you go . REED : Your family owns a junkyard ? BEN : Mmm-hmm . REED : That place is awesome . Here . You 're stripping the head . So , uh , who else lives here ? Just my mom and step-dad . They don 't care about all this ? They don 't understand it . You might want to cover your ears . Stand back a little . What the hell ? Damn it . It 's all right . All right , come on . Don 't blow up . Don 't blow up . Come on , man ! Guy 's open ! ( RATTLING ) Whoa ! Reed ! What did you do ? ( BEEPING RAPIDLY ) Now ! ( GROANS ) ( MACHINE POWERING DOWN ) MR. RICHARDS : Reed ! BEN : Did it work ? MR. RICHARDS : ( SHOUTING ) Hey , Reed ! BEN : Where 'd the rocks come from ? REED : From the same place the car went to . Where is that ? I don 't know yet . Reed ? What ? You 're insane . Thanks . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) MR. KENNY : Mr. Richards . Shall I alert the fire department ? ( CHUCKLES ) What is this ? Uh , this is a Cymatic Matter Shuttle . Me and my associate Ben have been working on it every day since 5th grade when we launched the beta version in my garage . And today is our first public demonstration . What does it do ? It modulates the frequency of matter from one location to another and back again . It 's a teleporter . A teleporter . Model car , please ? The model ... The model car , please , Ben . I don 't have the model car . Why don 't you have the model car ? I brought everything else . I specifically ... But ... Mr. Richards ? Okay , I will use this model plane . Hey , I just need to use this for one second . But I 'll give it back , I promise . Thanks . Here we go . Ben ? Please ? You may want to cover your ears . ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) ( PEOPLE GASPING ) Great . Now , Ben , bring it on back . Yeah . Oh , keep ' em covered . BEN : ( MUTTERS ) Oh , come on . No . Come on , come on . Don 't do this . ( LOW FREQUENCY EXPLOSION ) ( FREQUENCY RESONATING ) ( SPECTATORS GASP ) Oh , okay . Now if I can have your attention , please . What you 're looking at is sand , presumably from the Gansu Desert in China . Or perhaps even from the Sahara . You 're disqualified . We 're not entirely sure where it 's from ... Mr. Richards , you 're disqualified . Wait , what ? This is a science fair , not a magic competition . I don 't see any real science here . And you 're paying for the backboard . Did you put it on 6 or 8 ? BEN : Everything was the same . REED : I know , but you 're smashing the buttons . It 's delicate . You can 't smash it . Hey , kid , I 'm really sorry about your plane . You 're a dick . ( SCATTERED LAUGHTER ) You cranked it up too high . I didn 't crank it up too high . It was on the same setting as last time . I know , but it 's very precise . Excuse me , guys ? Just pack it up . Yeah ? Did you really build this in your garage ? Mmm-hmm . DR. STORM : Now , this is elegant . What are these ? REED : Uh , Sonic projectors , using cymatics to modulate the field . That 's why we can 't bring the matter back from the other dimension . Uh ... What ? We 've gone so far as to send matter to another dimension but we haven 't been able to maintain a field long enough to bring that matter back . You just did . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , you 're serious . I think you 've cracked inter-dimensional travel . I mean , we 're not sending anything to another dimension . We sent something , we think , to another part of the planet but I don 't know about another dimension . We found the same thing you did . We 've had it analyzed repeatedly , but no one 's ever seen anything like it . Oh , wow . I 'm sorry . We 're from the Baxter Foundation . This is my daughter , Sue . Hi . Hi . DR. STORM : We 'd like to give you a full scholarship . Uh , where did you say you were from again ? Hey . You could fit the whole neighborhood in there . SECURITY GUARD : What 's your name ? Uh , Reed . Richards . Yes , of course . We 've been expecting you . They actually wear lab coats here . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) This is you , sir . BEN : Here . What ? ( PAPER RUSTLING ) What is this ? It 's a going-away present . I 'm not going away . I 'm , like , a 40-minute train ride from Oyster Bay . Reed , look at this place . You belong here . I 've been here two minutes and I already know that . I 'm just going to school here . It 's where I 'm gonna be working . It looks like you 're home , buddy . ( INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER P.A. ) Hey . This place is pretty incredible . They have molecular chem books from the 1950s . Oh , hey . Sorry , did you say something ? Yeah , I was just asking , what are you listening to ? Portishead . Never heard of him . " Them . " I 'll have to check them out . I love this book . It 's about this guy , Captain Nemo . He invents a submarine that goes deeper than anything in history . Yeah , I know . I 've read it . So , you like music ? Is that kind of like your thing ? Pattern recognition . Pattern recognition ? Music is just a series of altered patterns . The musician creates the pattern and makes us anticipate a resolution then holds back . Makes you wait for it . There 's patterns in everything and everyone . Hmm . What 's mine ? You wanna be famous . Your parents , teachers all told you one thing , one way to be , and you ignored them . And now I 'm here . So you are . Am I that predictable ? Everybody is . Well , you 're wrong . I don 't wanna be famous . I just want my work to make a difference . Well , here you are , Captain Nemo . Go for it . Bye . DR. ALLEN : Let me guess . Some kid from the Internet . DR. STORM : Science fair . DR. ALLEN : Franklin , this board has invested a great deal in your little orphanage . We need real world applications . This has real world applications . I truly believe that there is an entire ... " An entirely new universe , " just beyond our ability to see . " Yes , I 've read your paper . Once we get there ... If we get there . ... we 'll be able to discover new resources . Energy sources which will revitalize our own . This is our chance to learn more about our planet and maybe even save it . And I 'm sure you all would agree that even if ... Wait . What is this ? Victor Von Doom is on here . He started this project and devoted a decade of his life to it . He deserves to be in jail . He deserves another chance . He set fire to your data servers before he left . I 'm going to personally supervise him . I need his talent . I believe he and Reed can finally get us there . We want to support you , Franklin , but you put a lot of faith in these kids . I put all my faith in them . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( DOOR WHIRRING OPEN ) So someone stole my design . DR. STORM : No one stole anything , Victor . Someone else figured out your idea ... and made it work . That 's what happens when you drop out of the world . Other people finish what you started . Well , if you came to ask for help , be better you didn 't insult both of us ... and turn back around . Don 't you wanna even look at the designs ? I told you I 'm done working for you and your employers . They 're not my employers . You can 't do a thing without their permission , yes ? Wake up . You 're an employee . They 'll stay out of my way this time . Trust me . It 's not you I don 't trust . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Well ... I hate to interfere with all of your important work . Guess we 'll just have to make history without you . Is Sue gonna be there ? I trust her . Yes , Victor , she 'll be there . ( DOOR WHIRRING OPEN ) Clean yourself up , son . ( DOOR WHIRRING SHUT ) ( BUZZING ) Holy shit . ( INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER P.A. ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Amazing . Oh , thanks . Amazing you didn 't black out the entire Western Hemisphere . Hmm ? You basically ripped a hole in the fabric of space-time with unspec 'd components and no supervision . Yeah , that was , uh , an accident . And if , by accident , you upped the power ... you would have created a runaway reaction that opened a black hole ... and swallowed the entire planet . Well , I 'm glad that didn 't happen . Are you helping on this ? I 'm making the environment suits . Based on the soil samples from our experiments ... anyone who goes to the other dimension is gonna need to be protected . REED : Who 's that ? Victor . Who 's Victor ? He started this whole project . Oh . Does he go here , too ? It 's complicated . Rudimentary . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Elementary . This is basically a child 's drawing . You know what Albert Einstein said . " If you can 't explain it simply , " you don 't understand it well enough . " Ten years searching for something that is basically runner-up for a baking soda volcano . We were actually disqualified . The potato clock got second . Reed Richards , Victor Von Doom . Victor started the Quantum Gate project when he was younger than you . Wow . It 's great to meet you . Hi , Susan . Hey , Victor . Do you prefer " Susan " ? No . It 's been a while . Didn 't expect to see you back here . Yeah , well , I couldn 't resist . When I heard about the design , I needed to see it with my own eyes . I gotta say , it 's pretty impressive ... Thank you . ... that you nearly destroyed our entire planet with speaker cable and aluminum foil . Yeah , that was an accident . He did get it to work . What is this ? This is where your little , uh , accident leads to . SUE : We put a camera on a drone we sent over there . The drone didn 't come back , but those images did . Wow . It 's beautiful . Yes , it is . New energy , resources . It 's a whole new world . Which can help save this one . Not that it deserves to be saved . I mean , think about it . The people running the Earth are the same ones running it into the ground . So , maybe it deserves what it 's got coming to it . Dr. Doom , over here . The failures of my generation are the opportunities for yours . There are no greater minds than the ones in this room . Is he gonna give a speech ? He 's gonna give a speech . But you 're gonna have to all come together . Each of you working together with a level of commitment and collaboration ... putting aside petty squabbles ... if you want to fix what my generation broke . If you can do that , work together ... then you can change the course of history . That 's a pretty good speech . I 'm in . Me , too . I 'm here , right ? First , design . We figure out what went wrong and correct it . Then we build , then we send organic matter over there . But , more importantly , we bring it back . VICTOR : And then ... most importantly , they send us . " Us " ? Us , us ? We 're going over there ? Not unless you get to work . So , get to work . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( RINGING CONTINUES ) DRIVER : Johnny Storm . So that 's the piece of shit Toyota you been talking about . Why , yes , it is . Now you promise me we 'll still be cool after I dust your ass . ( ENGINE ROARING ) ( ENGINE STALLS ) No . Come on . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Rookie ! ( KISSES ) Bye-bye . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , shit . ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) DR. STORM : I cannot believe you 're out here doing this nonsense again . I told you . What ? I told you I was doing 45 when I spun out . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) The ground was wet and I hydroplaned . Funny , I don 't seem to remember any rain today . You were probably too busy to notice . Johnny , I thought you were turning things around . What is this ? What are you talking about ? This ! This ! Is this the way you want the rest of your life to be ? You keep acting out . You have the potential and the IQ to do so much more . Oh , you mean like Sue ? I know you think you know what 's best for you , but trust me , son , you do not . Can you stop that ? What ? Stop what ? Stop talking to me like I 'm one of your students . Well , you 're not getting the car back . Excuse me ? You 're not getting the car back . I built that thing from scratch with my own two hands . With my money . My money , my car . You want it back , you 're gonna have to earn it . You 're gonna have to come work for me . I 'm not wearing a lab coat . JOHNNY : Appreciate your work , miss . Oh , you gotta untuck that shirt , man . Is that Adolf ? Long time . Still not German . And we don 't need any more help . Yes , you do . With what , his boundless enthusiasm ? Oh , why , thank you , Victor . He can build anything . With a broken arm ? What exactly happened ? What ? Were you racing again ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I could use some help , actually . Oh , this guy doesn 't take orders well . Yeah , especially from people who say shit like , " I don 't take orders well . " What you need , buddy ? Oh , that 's brilliant . Hey . What 's up ? Johnny . Reed . Nice to meet you . Have you welded before ? Of course . ( INAUDIBLE ) ( INDISTINCT ) Keeps overheating . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER ) Hey . What 's up ? I got to say , it 's fun having you here . Mmm-hmm . You kind of look like you 're in your element . Look , don 't get used to this . I 'm just here to get my car back . Right . It 's good seeing you too . ( SHUTTER CLICKS ) ( MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( GASPING ) Sorry . Oh , whoa ! Oh , my God . Why would you do that ? Sorry . ( CHUCKLES ) I freaked out . Oh , my gosh . Sorry . You were sort of sleeping . Was I ? Is that what that was ? It 's okay if you need to take a nap or something . I 'm good , thanks . Uh , so , that must have been cool with Dr. Storm as your dad . Yeah . Did he adopt you ? Mmm-hmm . Yeah , I know what that 's like . You were adopted ? No , I just wish that I was . Why ? I don 't know . We don 't really understand each other . Mmm . Where were you born ? Kosovo . You don 't have an accent . ( IN MOCK RUSSIAN ACCENT ) I don 't ? ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) Hey , Reed . Can I have a word ? Okay , yeah . Hey . You 're being unprofessional . You 're supposed to be down here , working . Yeah , I am . That 's what we 've been doing . That 's not what it looks like . We 're finished . What ? Yeah , we finished it . Do you want to see ? Yeah . Hey , Sue . Can you show him ? I 'm really tired . I 'm gonna go take a nap . Can you tell Dr. Storm for me ? We did it , Victor . DR. STORM : Harvey . DR. ALLEN : Franklin . Big day . Didn 't think we 'd make it here , but well done . I told you these kids could do it . ( WHISPERING ) Harvey 's here . MAN ON PA : Organic test commencing . ( CHATTERING ) Clear for launch . Goggles up . Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one . ( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ) Standing by for video acquisition . Status unknown . Stand by . Trying an alternate frequency . We 've got signal . ( CHUCKLES ) Look at the plates . It 's almost primordial . Unformed , like Earth over a billion years ago . DR. STORM : That place could explain the origin of our species . The evolution of our planet . Answers to questions we don 't even know to ask yet . BPS , body temp , ventilation rates are all elevated . Let 's bring him back . ( CHATTERING ) MAN ON PA : Goggles up . In five ... four ... three ... two ... one . ( SCATTERED CHEERING ) How is he ? The vitals are good . They 're really good . He made it . It 's safe . ( LAUGHING ) JOHNNY : All right ! Looks like we 're next . Gentlemen . Everyone . You all deserve an enormous pat on the back . I think it 's time to start coordinating with our friends at NASA . What ? It works . We have to start thinking about sending men . Yeah . Us . Look , I won 't deny that what you 've created here is incredible . But this isn 't the school science fair anymore . We have to bring in help now . Why just NASA ? Why not the Army or the CIA ? We could send our political prisoners there . Waterboarding in the fourth dimension could prove very effective . Why don 't we discussthe details of this someplace else ? In the meantime ... we appreciate your service . Oh . Hey , thank you . I won 't let this go , I promise you . SUE : Just give him a second to figure this out . Look , I don 't know about you guys , but I could use some ... ( WHISTLES ) Want a drink ? Ethanol kills brain cells . ( GRUNTS SOFTLY ) VICTOR : You are a lightweight ! ( LAUGHING ) REED : Looks like we need another refill . Here you go , Johnny . Yep . Yep . ( SIGHS ) Hey , Vic . You guys know who built the Apollo spacecraft , went to the moon ? Yeah . Your mama . ( ALL LAUGHING ) So , the answer 's no . But you know who Neil Armstrong is , right ? Yeah , of course . Of course . VICTOR : Buzz Aldrin ? REED : Yeah . First men to walk on the moon . Famous faces hired to conquer dreams that weren 't even theirs . Dreams that someone else , some other scientist ... who probably died penniless and alone ... and sat in a bar , telling people he sent men to the moon . That 's gonna be me . That 's gonna be me . Think it 's all of us . Unless we go first . Why don 't we go first ? God , this thing works , okay ? We can go up there , take five minutes . We can take a flag and plant it down , get our footprints down there . We 're gonna be the first people over there . Okay ? Screw those guys ! My dad might actually kill me this time . Johnny , by the time your dad finds out , we 'll already be back . Think about it . Just the three of us ? ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) Hello ? I 'm not going without you . What time is it ? Look , we started this thing together , we 're going together . I 'm not taking no for an answer , okay ? Forget Neil Armstrong ! Come on . Neil Armstrong ? You drunk ? Yeah , I am a little drunk . It doesn 't matter ! Look , the machine works . The machine works , Ben , and I need you to come with me . Now ? Yeah . Look , Ben ... I need you to come because we 're going tonight . I told the guys that I 'm not going without you . Okay ? Who 's gonna have my back ? All right , fine . ( STAMMERS ) Just give me a second , all right ? Okay . Please ? All right , buddy . Thank you , thank you . ( DOOR OPENS ) REED : He 's with me . What 's up , man ? What 's up , buddy ? How you doing ? It 's good to see you . Thanks , Panno . No problem , Mr. Richards . Why are we doing this tonight ? Huh ? Why are we doing this tonight ? You trust me , right ? Ta-da ! It 's just like ours , but expensive . ( INDISTINCT ) Guys , this is Ben . How you doing ? What 's up ? Are you his lucky charm ? I 'm sorry , this is Borat . Borat 's a dick . Are you guys sure you 're in the best shape to be doing this ? Oh , yeah . Yeah . We 're good . REED : Let 's do this . So , I guess I should come up with something better than " One small step for man ... " ? VICTOR : Strap in and get comfy , kids . We 're about to make history . BEN : Yeah , or die . Either / Or . REED : Wow , that 's great , Ben . Thanks . JOHNNY : All right , gentlemen . Hands and feet must remain inside the ride at all times . ( DOORS HISSING SHUT ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) Oh , shit . Dad , you need to come to the lab . AUTOMATED VOICE : Remote launch initiated . Ten ... Don 't blow up . Please , don 't blow up . Oh , yeah , that 's what I wanna hear before going into another dimension . Yeah , don 't worry . He does that . ... five ... four ... ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) three ... two ... one . Initiate launch . What happened ? Did we abort ? Uh ... I don 't think that we went anywhere . God damn it . Johnny ? Guys , can you hear me ? Wow . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) VICTOR : I made it . REED : Ben , look at this place . It 's amazing . We did it . BEN : I think we did . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) BEN : Here , give me a hand . Give me a hand . JOHNNY : Oh , yeah . This one is definitely going on Instagram . REED : Let 's do this . Ready ? After three . ( BEN AND REED IN UNISON ) One , two , three ! JOHNNY : Whoa , look at that . Whoa ! REED : Hey , Victor , I think you should see this . The energy seems to be converging over there . Come on . Let 's check it out . All right . Let 's do it quickly so we can get out of here . JOHNNY : ( CHUCKLES ) Nope . Uh-uh . I 'm good . BEN : Reed , what 's he doing ? We need to climb down there so we can get a better look . Oh , you guys go on without me . VICTOR : Stay here . We need an anchor . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , yeah . I 'll be a great anchor . ( GRUNTING ) REED : Okay . Easy does it . Just a little further . Right behind you . Okay . VICTOR : It 's responding to physical stimulus . Almost like a nerve impulse . I can feel it . The energy , it 's alive . ( METER WHIRRING ) REED : It 's incredible . There 's no expenditure . Reed . What ? I think we should go back . This is important , Ben . Come take a look . ( SIGHS ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) VICTOR : Go , go , go ! Oh , shit ! ( ALL PANTING ) BEN : ( SHOUTING ) Come on !

Help me ! I 'm coming ! BEN : Reed , help me ! Can 't move ! Ben ! Where are you ? BEN : Reed ? Help me . Ben . Reed . Ben ! Reed , help me . I can 't move ! I 'll get you out of there . ( GRUNTS ) Oh , my God . What the ... ? What ? ( GASPING ) ( MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) MALE DOCTOR 1 : Can we get a BP reading ? MALE DOCTOR 2 : BP 128 over 72 . MALE DOCTOR 1 : Bone density ? MALE DOCTOR 2 : Bone density rates are normal . MALE DOCTOR 3 : ( OVER P A. ) Reed , can you move your hand ? Where 's Ben ? Keep trying , Reed . Hey , do you guys know where my friends are ? Can you lift your index finger ? ( STAMMERING ) I ... I 'm trying . ( GROANS ) Where 's Ben ? Did you see him ? He was covered in the rocks . Why won 't you answer me ? ( SHOUTING ) Where are my friends ? Help me ! Increase sedative . 50 cc 's . REED : What have you guys done to me ? So , just for the record ... this program was under your supervision , was it not ? I already told you it was , but I wasn 't there when it happened . All I want to know is , where are my children ? I need to know if they 're alive . FEMALE DOCTOR : She 's unconscious . Somehow , she 's shifting in and out of the visible spectrum . We don 't know how . Her vitals are stable . She doesn 't seem to be able to control it . MALE DOCTOR 4 : Looks like we have some activity . ( GROANING ) ( MOANING ) ( GRUNTING ) Son . Oh , my God . ( SCREAMING ) ( EXHALES ) ( BREATHING NORMALLY ) ( EXCLAIMS ) BEN : ( FAINTLY ) Can anyone hear me ? Please , help me ! Somebody , please ! Is anybody there ? Ben ? Somebody answer me ! ( GRUNTING ) BEN : ( SHOUTING ) Somebody , please ! Help me ! Can anyone hear me ? Please , help me ! Hello ? Somebody answer me ! Anybody ? ( GRUNTING ) Ben ? Ben ! ( SCREAMING ) Reed ? REED : Oh , my God . Ben ? Reed , what happened to me ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna figure this out . ( ALARM BLARING ) Ben ! ( GRUNTS ) Please help me , Reed ! MAN OVER PA : Subject One has escaped containment . Oh , shit ! Shit ! Ben , I 'm coming back for you , I promise ! No , no , no ! Reed , help me ! Please don 't leave me ! I 'm sorry . Reed , do something , please ! Where is he ? Where is Reed ? I don 't know . He 's scared , Harvey . They 're all just scared kids . We don 't know what they are right now . All we know is that they are dangerous and powerful . Which makes them extremely valuable to the guys who run this place . If you think for a minute that I 'm going to allow you to turn these kids into some kind of ... You don 't have a choice , Franklin . And neither do I. Either we play ball with the government or who knows what happens to those kids . Now ... Here 's how this is gonna go . So you 're Ben Grimm . Where 's Reed ? I can 't begin to imagine what you are going through . He said he 'll fix it . Where is Reed ? Reed 's gone . Your friend isn 't coming back . Look , I know you 're scared . You should be . But we can help you . You wanna find a cure ? We have resources here , the best in the world . We 're analyzing what happened to you . Whatever it is , we can find a way to reverse it . We can help you , Ben . But you need to help us , too . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) What do you want me to do ? DR. ALLEN : His combat effectiveness this past year has been unprecedented . In terms of potential , you already know what he 's accomplished in the field . He 's been active in covert operations with a 100 % success rate . Protecting our men and women in battle and saving countless lives . Ladies and gentlemen , this is only the beginning . The other survivors of the " Baxter Incident " all exhibited unique physical conditions . We developed suits which allow them to contain and control these conditions . This subject 's suit controls her spectral flares and refractive visibility . With intense concentration she has also developed the ability to render other objects invisible . And , to neuropathically produce force fields . ( SUE GRUNTS ) All these abilities come from one place . Another dimension that our scientists have taken to calling " Planet Zero . " A planet infused with the same energy that transformed these survivors and potentially could transform our military capabilities . We have the direct link . With your continued support , once the Quantum Gate 2 project is finished , we 'll have control over more than that world . We 'll have control over ours . Everyone , have a look . What the hell is that ? Subject Number Two . ( GRUNTS ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( EXHALES ) 2,000 meters in six seconds . New record . Just need to work on my takeoff . I can make it in five . TECHNICIAN 1 : All target drones neutralized . TECHNICIAN 2 : Keep holding your breath , Susan . As long as you can . Directional stability is 33 over 10 . Rise is steady . Pitch is eight degrees . Your balance is getting better . ( PANTING ) Hey . They 're gonna send me on a project . Like Ben ? We should use these powers to do something . They 're not powers . They 're aggressively abnormal physical conditions that we 're gonna fix . Can you turn that off ? And what if they can 't ? What if it takes more time to get it right ? We could be talking years . I am not going to be a tool . Johnny ... Stan , you ready ? Yes , we are . Flame on . Okay , Johnny . Thank you , Sue . Don 't forget ... We 're here to get our lives back . The subjects have agreed to cooperate with us until we find the source of their powers and , potentially , a cure . Why don 't we go see the big guy ? DR. ALLEN : ( OVER SPEAKER ) Hi , Ben . I got some friends of mine here , from Washington D.C. , visiting . Got a second to say hello ? It 's an honor to meet you , Mr. Grimm . We appreciate all you 're doing for us . That was the deal . Right ? And there she is , the Quantum Gate herself . The , uh , star of the show . ( CHUCKLES ) Franklin . I 'd like for you all to meet Franklin Storm ... who is our supervisor here on the floor . How do you do , sir ? Good morning . Good morning . How long until it 's ready ? Well , we 've had a few issues , but we 're getting closer . Closer every day . All right , Dr. Allen . We 'll give you what you need . In the meantime , we 'd like to put more of your subjects in the field . Subject Two is ready to go . Get him ready for combat . DR. STORM : Susan ! Can I have a word with you ? They 're sending Johnny into the field . You mean he 's sending himself into the field . The only way to stop him is to cure him . And that means finishing the Gate . I can 't finish it without Reed . Reed 's not coming back . He abandoned us , left us here . He was afraid . He didn 't know what this place was . I can 't believe you 're still defending him . Help me track him down , Suzu . He 'll listen to you . We 'll reopen the Gate , find a cure , end this . Johnny 's your brother . It 's never been as easy for him as it has for you . But , like it or not , he 's family . And family means we take care of each other . What can I do ? The FBI , CIA , and NSA have blips of Reed here and there ... but they can 't seem to see ... A pattern . A pattern . Where was he last seen ? Three months ago , in Panama . SUE : Did you get an IP ? MILITARY TECH : Early on , he was using some old , buried e-mail accounts . Bouncing off satellites . He 's keeping himself pretty well hidden . For a short while , we were able to ping him , here and there . Caught him on a few sites . He was looking for scrap metal , buying parts . Never stayed online that long . Was he looking for anything else ? He was searching for him . I 'm gonna need some music . MILITARY TECH : Excuse me ? I need music . It helps me think . ( LATIN MUSIC PLAYING ) ( BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH ) The valve is worn , it 's not worth twenty . I 'll give you ten . I got people who work for me . Twenty or no deal . I 'll give you five and I 'll fix your register for free . ( RINGS ) Gracias . ( GRUNTING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES ) SUE : Captain Nemo . That 's him . He 's routing his e-mails through this relay . Got him . You did what you had to do . Hi , Ben . We 've got another project for you . I think you 're gonna like this one . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ) Freeze ! Do not move ! Get down on the ground ! SOLDIER : Freeze ! ( GRUNTS ) Oh , my God . Ben ! So , this is where you 've been hiding out . Wait , stop . Okay , let me explain . ( GRUNTS ) Why ? I 'm no good to you , to anyone . This is all my fault . That , we can agree on . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) REED : Does it hurt ? I 'm used to it . I 'm sorry . That 's what you said when you left . I 'm going to fix this . You can 't fix this . Nobody can . I promise you , I 'm going to fix this . I stopped believing in your bullshit a long time ago . You were my best friend . Look at me . I 'm not your friend . You turned me into something else . Nice work , Ben ! ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) Hey , Reed . Look , I 'm sorry , but I didn 't have a choice . We need your help to finish the Gate . It 's the only chance we have to figure out what happened to us , and reverse it . You really think that they care about us ? You know how they 've used Ben . Yeah . I do . And they 're gonna do the same thing to Johnny if we don 't stop them . The only shot we 've got is on the other side of that Gate . Do you ever wonder what life would have been like ... if you hadn 't come to the science fair that day ? We can 't change the past . But we can change the future . You said you wanted your work to make a difference . This is it . This is your chance . Are you ready ? You made it ugly . It 's good to see you again , son . ( KEYS CLACKING ) I 'm gonna need ten minutes . To do what ? I need to make a couple adjustments to the source code . You have a few steps that are out of order . It can 't be that simple . It might not be ten minutes . It could be a little less . Come on . Let 's go . I got a good feeling , Stan . I 'm gonna crack five seconds . Hey , could I take a couple of minutes with my son ? Sure , no problem . Guys , can you give us five minutes ? What 's going on ? Reed is back . We 're closer than we 've ever been before . Closer to what ? Our old lives . Oh , you mean your life ? No , son . You always said I had the potential to do something important . Who 's to say this isn 't it ? Sometimes things just happen for a reason . Johnny , you have no idea what they are planning to do to you . They 're not doing anything to me . I 'm doing this with them . Johnny , you need to listen to me ... I did listen to you , and that 's what got me here in the first place . I 'm an adult . I 'm old enough to make my own decisions . MAN OVER PA : Clear for launch . Stand by . Look who it is . Hey . It 's good seeing you , man . Good to see you , too . MAN OVER PA : Sonic projectors engaged . Goggles up . Initiate launch . SCIENTIST : Systems check complete . We have a visual . QUANTUM GATE EXPLORER : Roger that , Control . Are you receiving atmospheric data ? Copy that . Checking configuration . Data transmission looks good . The landscape 's changed . How ? I don 't know , it 's just different . Commencing element and geological test series . SCIENTIST : Copy . Hey , Control , I 'm picking up a heat signature about 60 yards away . Now , what could that be ? Hard to make out . The signal keeps fluctuating . It 's moving . Heading towards us . SCIENTIST : Copy that . Proceed with caution . Do you have a visual ? It appears to be a human form ... with some sort of foreign element around it . ( WEAKLY ) I knew you 'd come back . Victor ? Not possible . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Subject appears injured . Get the med kit . Let 's get him to the shuttle . Grab him . Come on . Easy , guys . Abort . Bring him back . SCIENTIST : Aborting mission . Stabilize the subject and prepare for transport . Oh , shit . Preparing for launch . Transfer the subject to Containment Room One . EXPLORER : Copy that . His thermal signature is barely registering . His biochemistry is off the charts . I want to talk to him . Nobody talks to him until I do . Confine the others to their quarters . Victor ? We don 't know how you survived over there but we 're still analyzing the data . It appears that your environment suit fused with your body ... but we 're working on that . We 're going to help you , Victor . We 're working with the government now . We 're going to send more expeditions to the other side but first you need to tell us everything you know about that place . VICTOR : You want to know how I survived ? That place kept me alive . Gave me strength . Power . What kind of power ? The kind men like you must never possess . ( ALL SCREAMING ) You couldn 't resist coming back . It 's not enough to ruin your world . Now you want to ruin mine . Victor . If this world must die so that mine may live ... so be it . ( GROANING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED TONE ) ( CHOKING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Code Red . Code Red . There is an emergency in this building . Follow standard emergency protocols . Proceed to the nearest exit and leave the building immediately . Code Red . Code Red . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) There is an emergency in this building . Follow standard emergency protocols . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ( GUNFIRE ) Code Red . Code Red . There is an emergency in this building . Follow standard emergency protocols . Proceed to the nearest exit and leave the building immediately . Running away again ? No . Sue ! ( COUGHING ) My bad ! Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm all right . Where 's Dad ? DR. STORM : Victor , no . Just stop ! Out of my way , Franklin . I 'm going home . This is your home , son . Not anymore . There is nothing for you over there . Only the power to create a new world . Victor , we 're not gods . We 're just people . And we are stronger together than we are apart . What good is it if you 're alone ? I have always been alone . SUE : Victor , stop ! Just stop ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) It 's too late , Susan . The Earth is dying . Humanity had its chance . ( GROANING ) No ! Dad ! JOHNNY : Dad ! No ! Dad , no , I 'm sorry ! SUE : Dad , no ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad , move ! Victor , no ! ( GROANS ) ( WEAKLY ) Promise me . What ? Look after each other . Dad , I 'm sorry ! Dad , I 'm sorry . Dad , please . No ! ( GRUNTS ) He 's overloading the system to create a runaway reaction . It 's not gonna stop ! It 'll create a black hole that 'll swallow the Earth ! He 's pulling everything into the other dimension ! Hold on ! Johnny ! Got it ! ( ALL GROANING ) REED : The matter from Earth is being converted to energy ! We need to stop Victor ! He 's the source ! He 's mine ! SUE : I have an idea . This is what I do . ( GRUNTS ) ( ROARS ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( CLAMORING ) Where are you , Susan ? ( GROANS ) Victor , don 't do this ! There is no Victor . There is only Doom . ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) I saw a different future for us , Susan . BEN : Help me ! Reed ! Ben ! ( STRAINING ) Goodbye , Susan . Ah ! ( GASPING ) ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) Reed ! Is he dead ? If that thing 's still active , so is he . We can 't beat him . He 's stronger than any of us . Yeah , he is . But he 's not stronger than all of us . Look , this place gave him his powers ... but it gave us all of ours , too . It 's who we are now . Maybe it 's who we 're meant to be . We opened this door , we 're gonna close it . So , what 's the plan ? Enough ! When your world is destroyed , and I 'm all that 's left ... then it will be enough . ( GROANING ) ( GROANS ) Always so smug , thinking you were smarter than me . I am smarter than you . Now ! Hey ! It 's clobbering time ! This better work . No . ( SCREAMING ) JOHNNY : Let 's get the hell out of here ! GENERAL : While the world may not know what you did to save it ... The men and the women in this room do . And so does the President . That said , we 'd like to continue our existing relationship . So , if we 're all in agreement ... We 're not . Excuse me ? We 're not remotely " all in agreement . " We don 't need you or anybody else to keep an eye on us . We just want a place where we can work . And whatever we come up with belongs to us . And what if we say no ? ( BEN GROWLING ) Say yes . How much space are we talking about ? A lot . Whoa . Hey . So , uh , I thought there were gonna be four of you ? Oh , there is . Labs are upstairs . Engineering 's on the south side and Assembly 's downstairs . We 've been operating out of here for over 12 years , now . Well , officially , that is . But you still won 't find our name on any government books . Most people just refer to this as , uh , Central City . But call it whatever you want . We work for you now . JOHNNY : Oh , wow . Now , that 's what I 'm talking about . That 's pretty nice . ( SUE CHUCKLES ) I 'm taking that area over there . REED : I could get used to this . I got it . The " Franklin Storm Research Center . " Dad was kind of allergic to his name in big letters . Which reminds me , I think that the four of us should have a name . Why would we need a name ? Because we 're a team now , and there 's four of us so we should come up with a name for it . Like , " The Human Torch and the Torchettes . " Ugh . No . BEN : Are you kidding me ? How about " The Big Brain and His Neurons " ? How about " The Big Brain and Her Neurons " ? How about " Two Guys , a Girl , " and the Thing that Nobody Wanted " ? ( GROWLS ) Hey , we both know that you could take him . Hey . Hey . What ? We 've come a long way since the garage . Gotta say , it 's fantastic . Say that again . It 's fantastic . Yes , it is . Guys , I got it . Ready ? Yeah .

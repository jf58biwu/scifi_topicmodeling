 [ snoring ] [ gasps ] [ resumes snoring ] What ? What 'd I miss ? Oh , nothing important . We 've just figured out a way to defeat Zarkon . Really ? I dozed for ten minutes , and you guys figured out how to defeat the forces of evil ? You 've been asleep for three hours . I think we 've got something here . It 's dangerous and there are a lot of moving parts , but if we can coordinate everything just right , then- - Zarkon 's reign will be at an end , and the savagery that 's poisoned our universe can finally be cleansed . - You 've done it , Shiro . - We did it together . As long as we all stick to the plan , it should work . It will work . Perhaps , then , you 'll learn that not all Galra are as bad as Zarkon . I hope not . [ Antok ] Ulaz was right to trust you all . He sacrificed everything to bring us together . Let 's honor him by taking down Zarkon . - [ Hunk ] So , what 's the plan ? - The plan is amazing ! First , we infect Zarkon 's ship with a virus . Then , we make an extra-large wormhole and lure Zarkon inside of it , zapping him a bajillion light-years away . Then , when he pops out on the other side , all like , " Oh , why doesn 't my ship work ? " Voltron kicks his butt ! Pew , pew , pew ! Womp , womp , womp ! Huh ! Hi-yah ! [ deep voice ] " I 'll form the head ! " [ normal voice ] That 's what you say , Shiro . Yeah , yeah . Yeah ! We won for all time ! Wow . So , this is it . I guess the only question is , when do we strike ? As soon as we build a teludav big enough to wormhole Zarkon 's ship . Oh , man . The teludav again ? Does that mean we need more scaultrite ? That 's just one of the many things we 'll need . Am I , uh ... Am I sensing a trip back to the space mall here ? [ Coran ] I 'm afraid not . This is gonna take a lot more scaultrite than we can find at any Unilu shop . For this plan to succeed , we 're gonna need to split up . We all have a task to do . Keith , Hunk , you 'll be in charge of getting the scaultrite . If any one of us fails , the entire plan fails . [ mouse squeaking ] So , how about a kiss for good luck ? [ smacking lips , moaning ] [ muffled scream ] Don 't worry , we 'll see each other soon . Take care , Coran . Stay safe , Princess . [ grunts ] Did you sense the lion ? [ groans ] Nothing . - It is wise that you rest . - I will find that lion . Begin the process again . Why does Allura get to take a leisurely visit to the Balmera while we have to fly into the belly of a giant space worm to get scaultrite ? You heard Coran . Building a huge teludav isn 't easy . Everyone has a job to do and this is ours . But I always get the worst jobs . Go to a Galra-occupied planet to get my lion . Go to a Galra-occupied Balmera to get a crystal . Go into a belly of a beast with the only Galra alien team member . I 'm not an alien . Well , you 're kind of an alien . You 're way more alien than me . You 're at least some alien . I 'm-I 'm none alien . [ sighs ] Let 's just concentrate on the job here . Yeah . Was-Was your mom the alien ? Your grandpa ? How Galra are you ? I don 't know . Did the Blade of Marmora , like , teach you the secret handshake , or something ? No . No one said anything . The Blade of Marmora ... They 're real tight-lipped , aren 't they ? I get that your society is secret , but is everything a secret ? Okay , look , it 's bad enough that Allura hates me now . Can you just lay off ? Allura doesn 't hate you . You just need to give her time to accept the fact that you 're Galra , the race that destroyed her entire planet and all of her people . Yeah , she might hate you a little bit . Let 's just watch the video Coran uploaded and stay on task . We need to find out how to collect this stuff . Hello , brave Altean . No way . Is that Coran ? So , you 're about to go into the belly of a weblum to harvest scaultrite . Good for you ! Scaultrite is an important substance , with thousands of commercial and industrial uses , including fabrication foam , insect night vision goggles , teludav- - Uh anti-fungal klanm√ºirl lotion and other such lubricants . What 's wrong with the video ? It 's ten thousand years old . It 's probably corroded . I could go on for days . But you 've got a weblum to enter and some scaultrite to collect . Oh , look ! There 's a weblum now . Hello , big fella ! Hey , Coran ! I 'm off to eat some planets . There 's one now ! - Nyum , nyum , nyum , nyum , nyum ! - We 'll see you soon ! As you probably remember from school , the weblum is an enormous creature and an integral part of keeping our universe functioning . It survives off of the- - ... left over from dead planets . It then reconverts the quintessence remnants by- - ... becoming the building blocks of new solar systems . Incredible , isn 't it ? [ both whimpering nervously ] Of course , these are no gentle giants . They 're actually giants that are quite deadly , which leads to rule number one . It 's an important one , so listen closely . Stay away from its- - - You got that ? - No . No , I didn 't . It 's like a rhyme . Say it with me . Stay away from its- - Oh , come on ! Other things to remember include avoiding the poisonous- - ... eye sockets- - ... could lead to certain death ! Whoa . What are those ? [ Keith ] They look like ... dead planets . That 's strange . The charts I 'm looking at show these planets should still be thriving . Wow . What do you think happened to them ? Asteroid strike ? Something tells me they died an unnatural death . [ Hunk ] Look ! [ Keith ] Guess that ancient Altean weblum tracker put us right on the money . We gotta get out of here ! We haven 't watched the entire video yet ! - We don 't know what to do ! - We 're not leaving . You fly , keep our distance . I 'll skim through the video . So , you 've made it into the weblum 's first stomach ! - [ Hunk ] Rewind ! - [ Keith ] I know ! [ Coran ] So , you 've identified a weblum . Great ! Now , remember rule number one . Stay away from its face . [ Hunk ] Wait , that 's rule number one ? We broke rule number one ! [ Hunk ] Oh , no ! What 's it doing ? Get us out of the way , now ! [ grunting ] The weblum 's natural defense- - venomous laser , deadly acid- - total annihilation- - death monster- - ... to find its blind spot on the back of its neck , just below the gills . That 's your way inside ! If I can 't see ya , I can 't kill ya ! - [ rapid beeping ] - [ grunts ] This isn 't good . This isn 't good ! [ both grunting ] We 're attached to its back , in its blind spot . Good . We 're going in . Wait , what do we do when we 're inside the beast ? A quick recap of what to do when you 're inside the beast . One , avoid things that want to kill you . Two , get to the third stomach and find the scaultrite gland . Three , activate the weblum 's defense mechanisms and collect the excess material from the gland . That 's the scaultrite ! - Seems simple enough . - Seems under-explained . - Come on . - [ sighs ] [ grunts , groans ] [ grunting ] [ Hunk ] Got it , got it . Why are you tampering with evidence ? Commander Thace , I was ordered to assist you in your investigation into the possible traitors on board . Ordered by whom ? Haggar . I 've analyzed the sentry that was destroyed just before the shields went down . The one that was killed by Prorok . I 've already examined him . So , you found the trace elements of luxite on the wound ? It 's a very rare metal . If we find others on the ship in possession of luxite , we will have found our traitors . Then what are you waiting for ? Begin the search starting with the lower block . I 'll assign some sentries to that . Is there anything else ? As chief investigator , your life could be in danger . I have been given orders to remain by your side until we clear all personnel or find the spy . [ grunts ] Uh , yuck ! What am I standing on ? A mucus pocket ? I do not like mucus ! And is that steaming stomach acid ? Lookit , right over there . Oh , man , I really hope I don 't see any blood . Hunk ! Knock it off . You 're freaking yourself out . No , standing inches away from a pus-bubble is freaking me out . [ groaning ] Look , we 're inside a disgusting worm . There 's no way to sugarcoat it . We 're gonna need that big brain of yours if we want to make it through . - Will you be all right ? - [ continues groaning ] I said , will you be all right ? Uh ... Okay , okay . [ inhales deeply ] I 'll be okay . Good . I gotta be able to count on you . Besides , no one knows an explosive digestive tract like you . Wait , wait , wait . Did you just make a joke ? [ chuckles ] Seriously , that was a joke , wasn 't it ? You 're saying I throw up a lot . I get it . It 's funny . [ laughing ] I do . Wow . Galra Keith is way funnier than regular Keith . Okay , we need to find a way around the stomach acid . Huh ? - What are these things ? - Uh ... Uh ... I don 't know . Maybe they 're bacteria ? - Uh ... Oh ... - [ creatures squeaking ] Wait , wait , wait . They seem friendly . They seem friendly . Maybe they 're good bacteria . They like me . They 're- - [ chuckles ] They 're tickling me . Wait , that 's not tickling ! That 's hot acid ! [ screams ] They want to kill us ! They want to kill us ! I think they 're part of the creature 's digestive system ! They 're trying to break down the food and we 're the food ! [ groaning ] I can 't see anything ! [ groans , grunts ] [ grunting ] Hunk ! I 'm here , surrounded by blood . I hate blood ! [ Keith ] You 've gotta find a way out of the circulatory system . Hunk ! I 'm outnumbered here ! Meet me in the third stomach ! Gotta get out of this acid . [ screaming ] [ grunting ] Huh ? [ grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] What the- - ? Impossible . [ screams ] I don 't like blood-slides ! [ grunts ] [ grunting ] Oh , no . Don 't move . I 'm here to help . Huh ? [ grunting ] [ weapon whirring ] - You 're Galra . - [ creatures squeaking ] Not those things again . What are you doing ? [ alarm blaring ] You 're turning this ship into a bomb . [ grunts ] [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ loud rumbling ] Keith ! Keith , are you there ? Keith , answer me ! [ grunting ] [ grunting , yelling ] - [ groaning ] - [ running footsteps approaching ] [ gasps , grunts ] [ weapon whirring ] I guess you can keep your weapon . [ groaning , grunting ] [ sighs ] [ groans ] - Oh , my gosh , I found it ! - [ stomach grumbling ] Oh , my gosh , don 't throw up . Don 't throw- - [ retches ] Keith ! Keith , you made it ! We both made it ! Who is this ? Someone I found . He doesn 't talk much . Also , he 's Galra . What , do you guys all know each other ? [ chuckles ] Are you sure we should be rescuing a Galra soldier right now ? We 're Paladins of Voltron . We can 't just leave people to die even if they are Galra . Now , come on . Let 's get what we came for and get out . Okay , well , that- - that might be a problem , too . The scaultrite gland somehow secretes mucus , or saliva , or something gross , which becomes crystallized . The only problem is , I think that we have to trigger the weblum 's defense mechanism . [ rumbling ] [ groans ] Not again . - [ rumbling ] - [ both ] Uh ... [ grunts ] [ gasps , screams ] They 're everywhere ! Oh , whoa . [ both yelling , grunting ] I think this thing is getting rid of the excess gas produced from its multiple stomachs . - What ? - It 's farting ! [ laughs ] [ grunts ] Hunk , what do we gotta do to get that scaultrite gland to goop ? Uh , oh . Uh ... Wait a second , wait a second , wait a second . " Stay away from its face . " The blue laser . Ah ! I know what to do ! What ? If we want that third stomach gland to secrete the ooze , I need to get farted out of the weblum 's butt and attack the face , getting it to fire its laser puke . For the sake of the universe , I 'll provoke the beast ! You two stay here and get that scaultrite ! Hurry ! I don 't know how long we can hold these things off . [ yelling ] I 'm out ! Heading to my lion now . - [ door beeping ] - [ gasps ] Commander , there you are . The lower block has been scanned for luxite . - I found nothing . - Then continue the search . Sir , I must remain by your side . Haggar 's orders . Hunk , whatever you 're gonna do , do it now ! Roger that . Provoking giant space worm now . Come on ! Hunk ! Let 's see you ignore me now . Yoo-hoo ! Over here ! Yes ! Yes , it 's gonna do it ! Oh , no , it 's gonna do it ! [ gasps ] It 's working ! I think it 's about to get hot in here . [ Hunk ] Oh , yes ! Oh , no ! [ yelling ] [ grunts ] Oh , yeah ! He 's out ! [ sighs ] Tell me you got the scaultrite . Grabbing it now . [ weapon whirring ] So , you 're just like the rest of ' em . I 'm coming out . [ Hunk ] On my way . Where 's your buddy ? He 's long gone by now , and he got a bag of scaultrite . What ? Should we go after him ? No . Whatever the Galra are planning won 't matter after we defeat Zarkon . Copy that . By the way , Hunk , you really came through in the clutch back there . Without you , the mission would have been a failure . Aw , thanks , Galra Keith . You 're all right . I think turning Galra has made you a better human . I didn 't just turn Galra !

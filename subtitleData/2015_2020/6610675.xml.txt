 Previously ... Wait . It 's weird . There is a boy here . Used the technology of nano-bot in the body . This is the key of stings in their submissions . The memory Turner is a mess . It makes me very nauseous . I was so overwhelmed ... With all these feelings , but ... You need time . That 's what you 're trying to tell me . Here Theo , my brother . When Theo appears problems too . He just pointed at me . No one taught you to do never feed a vagabond . It 's gone . He cleared the floor . You told me that Ed had been cremated . That 's what I was told . I try to find somebody Who will not be found . Your father ? Everything comes to math , so maybe there is a equation That would find your father . What is it ? Ed wanted to be cremated . I 'm finally glad do it for him . I can not believe that Turner kept the body of Ed frozen whole time . It 's just ... Disturbing ? Criminal ? Both . But Turner died and nobody cries Ashes , so ... Maybe karma exists after all . Where can I put it ? Perhaps here ? I made a small place for him . Thank you . I have an idea . What if you , me , Linus and Cameron went out tonight To let off steam ? - Cameron ? I 'm not sure . - Why ? It 's not going with Goodkin ? No , it 's fine . It 's just that ... I really want to do , is found my father 's bastard And make him pay . - I need a place to sleep . - What ? The brother of Camille me everything stolen . What ? Say again . Theo stole all my smart devices . He took my smart dishwasher It took my smart oven He took my dryer smart . I guess it was not so smart Let Theo sleep with you , right ? Have you called your own or ... I already walking on eggshells with her . Apparently a tenant called and complained about me . Complained about what ? What I was doing too much noise . It was surely Theo too . Listen , I just have to stay discreet about it And I have to fend for myself replace any device . But I do not have the money for . If you went back to your parents ? Are you kidding ? If they ever discovered This , they will not stop getting drunk . I feel that you do not want me as a roommate . It 's true . Dude , I had a roommate first year of college who insisted To write contracts for sitting naked On my bed And after that , I told myself " never . " First , for me the clothing is not optional . And I 'm not a stranger Assigned you to be your roommate . I 'm your best friend . This is Maggie . New sample . So what to say ? You 'll help your brother ? - Well , You can stay . - Very good ! I owe you one ! How long will it take to replace all your stuff ? Not long . Three , four months . Hey , Fisher , how do you feel ? Stronger every day . Well , I 'm happy . You found leads for my father ? Stinger has done a good job for erase everything on it . But maybe since my father was a pro Technology For so long , he forgot that there was another world information Which is not related to technology . My garage is filled with boxes , And before I knew that the house was my family , I thought it was that of Ed , but ... Perhaps there is something in these boxes concerning my father . If you need help looking for , let me know . Thank you . Hello . - Hey , Cam . - Hey . - Hey . - Hey . - Oh , sorry . - Sorry . - You take it . - Uh no . This is ... this is the last caramel . It 's good , I 'll take anything . Yes , because you know , it is your favorite . You were there first . Take it . - This is not ... - Cameron takes it . - Excuse me . - I 'll take the ... Hi . What ? Theo stole your stuff ? Why did not you tell me ? Because it does not matter . Linus , losing a sock in the dryer does not matter , But being robbed by his dryer my stupid brother is ! Why are you yelling at me ? I am the victim here . That 's right , sorry . What about your rental insurance ? A rental insurance . It exists ? I think I 'll just try to cover it At any price . No , absolutely not . Listen , everyone . A stranger was found dead in a dumpster in Carson . Cause of death : trauma had to to repeated beatings and bruises On the head and body . Links marks on his wrists and ankles That suggest he was attached during the attack . Do we could recover fingerprints ? His footprints disappeared . It looks like they were burned . According scars , it looks like it happened At least a year ago . So his fingerprints have been removed Well before he was beaten to death . Sometimes criminals Burn their fingerprints in order to hide their identities . That 's why we need to find out who he was And why he was killed . Checked Communication , one , two . I hear you . Stretch , going on a private channel a moment . - You hear me ? - Yes . We have a job to do . So what ? You know , you and me working together , It will not become annoying if ? You want to say as you come to ? So ... I have never really understood what you were doing here . Well .. The basis I was recruited to spy Kirsten , But this mission was arrested obviously So , now I stay here and I want this tablet . - That 's it ? - No no . Sometimes I do not stay there And occasionally I save people 's lives . I 'm anxious to have other missions . - Genre On the ground ? - Yes . Oh my God . Then you should increase the level of your workouts defenses . I would hate to happen to you something . But I thought you were my coach . No . Do you need something more brutal . More brutal than you ? I did not know that was possible . Thank you . - Cameron ? - Hm ? Is it possible that you me transported Before the unknown becomes impossible sting ? It 's true forgiveness . It 's good , we came back to the starting point . The clock set to five minutes , please . Neuro , I left . In three , two , one , go ! It will take you 36 dollars . I 'm in a supermarket . In Green Basket . Seeks Green Basket . You see , I am important . The unknown ranks of the products . Ranger as if he was in A kind of queue or ... No , it packs kind ... Customers shopping . The Green Basketball is a supermarket Independent family located in Culver City . Mr. Hughes , I have another one . Jamie . Let me listen . The name of the unknown is Jamie . Jamie B. - Toc Knock Who 's there ? - Butter - Butter Peanut peanut that ? Cleans five on the wing ! That 's your best joke ? Go and help Mrs. Wilkins to take her shopping in her car . Do not forget your receipt Mrs. Wilkins . Jamie could not be a spy or a criminal . Why that ? - It Could not have . Wait , it goes something . Remember the guy with the red baseball cackles ? The one I saw in the memory Mulaney captain ? Yeah , so what ? It is in memory Jaimie too . In the store . It must be connected to both surveys . Fisher , look at the store 's security camera . Let Linus watch . Perhaps we can identify that child . I move you a recent memory . Everything went black . All right on my side . Linus ? Wait . Put an end to it , Rain Man ! Kirsten , what 's wrong ? Jamie just got hit . Guys , I think he blindfolded eyes and is attached to something . Please ! Stop ! It is scared and confused . I 'll stop when you give us what we want ! There is a man here . I know you did ! I do not understand what you mean . Heart rate and pressure increase . She is in the memory of the dead . This is the end . You 're closely spaced remembrance of the death of Jamie . Ejects up ! It just died . Jamie is under water ! He is drowning ! If drowns ? Where is she ? It is in a previous memory . This is much earlier . It can not have memories of death . It 's impossible . Ejects up ! I heart Linus . Breathe deeply , breathe . How is Jamie death ? He was beaten to death or was it drowned ? Both . There ... He died twice . Guys , the coroner 's report Said there was no water in his lungs . He died a brutal trauma , he has not drowned . Poor . Who would want to hurt him ? Those who did this wanted to shoot him information , But he did not know what they were talking . There 's some mistake on person . They got the wrong guy . But why there are two memories of his death ? This part is a puzzle . We just talked to Mr. Hughes Director at The Green Basket . It was said to Jamie B. - How did it go ? - Not very good . He said Jamie wandered the store , there are 8 months Without memories , just being repeat her name . - " Jamie B. " . - Amnesia ? Most of the time , in case of amnesia , there is at least the disappearance ratio , But I looked . No one sought Jamie B. Mr Hughes has done much to Jamie Gave him a job , a place to live . A room at the back of the store . See what you can find . I 'm going back instead of murder . See if we missed something . Wait . I feel very bad Theo stole you . I should have insist that you bring it . - I ... - Stop . Its good . It 's only business . He had nowhere to go , no house ... No family . At least nothing he can remember . When have you seen for the last time ? There are two days . That Jamie was a vagabond . A he left things behind ? Some clothes ... A book . He had that I gave him Which was not much . Our boss said that You have a video card for us . Thank you . You were there for him When nobody was . - You okay ? - Family Drama . Theo is painful , is not it ? I have closely monitored all involved in this program . I was able to provide my team Based on behavior patterns and family histories . I bet you you give in to heart joy with my family history . Your education was weird . You have exceeded . Until Theo tornado blew into town . You are strong , smart . I know you 're very well for this job . No one stands like that and holds a tablet like you . It 's not the job I mean . I know you 're scared to do something more testing . I just want to make you ready . How you 'll know ? Believe me , you will know . You 're not the same girl with this shitty past Bakersflield who left it a few years ago . So do what you have to do to fix things . It 's complete " Jamie B. " I might be a little new at this , But since when hugs have become an investigative tool ? What do you mean ? You and the manager at the supermarket . I do not know . Just came to me . It seemed like the right thing to do . Mr Hughes was like a father to Jamie . He took care of me when my father left . It was not required , but it did , I imagine that my way , I was grateful . But I never told him . And now he 's dead ... I waited too long to tell him how I felt . Man , I feel like a new man ! This tea shower gel is awesome ! All tingling sensation and the right places . I interrupted something ? But you know what ? I should go actually . I see you Morning . - Tomorrow . - Goodbye . - I 'm sorry , brother . - What are you talking about ? I made this hyper embarrassing moment for you . Believe me , we both Does not have to be weird help . What are you doing ? What happens ? Nothing . Just when she was in my memories , She stumbled on wholesale my feelings for her . That 's all . She knows how you feel . - This sucks . - Why ? Because it has all the power there . I know how she feels . Not you think know . Let me guess ... " I need time to understand what I feel . " That 's typical ! Just leave him alone . So far , she had not many feelings to understand . I love you both . I just do not see that happening . You had wine , you shared a pizza - You were face to face and you ... - And you ruined the moment . If the moment was to take place An Indian guy in shorts should not be allowed to spoil it . I have to leave here . - Why ? - It drives me crazy ! It was our first fight . My father left in a hurry , He surely not had time to cover his tracks . Finally , its analog traces . Maybe something here will lead us to him . Can I ask you a question ? Course . When did you know for the first time you loved your wife ? You mean the woman who left me ? The woman who was convinced that I was 51 % cop And 49 % husband ? - This woman ? - Sorry . I did not ... It 's good . I did not know it was wrong . We already loved . Many . It was a different life . When I met you for the first time , You wore your wedding ring , But you do not anymore from the hospital . It was necessary to move on . So based on my inability to stay married , I should not be the person Who gives you advice on relationships . As said , I know how hard it is To find someone with whom you hang really . This is rarer you think . Wait . I think I found something . It is an ancient suit of Ed . If Ed came home in 38 normal . It is cut by Nardini 's Bervelly Hills . - This is thin . - End like paper . It 's more than what you got there 20 seconds . Sorry . You have to ... I have . Excuse me . Shut up . Out of the question . Tales to Astonish ? It 's a classic . This is one of my favorites . Really ? Like , what ? There . You want to give me the quiz ? Make sure that the girl who works at comic shop Knows what she 's talking about ? Of course not . What important character entered Number 35 ? Hank Pym , Ant-Man ! - The number 49 ? - Trick question . As Hank Pym , but this time as Giant-Man . Well played , well played . You look surprised . Most comic fans Are at bottom the zombies these days . Give me a spirited scientific anytime . Now a question for you . What would you say if I told you that At some time tomorrow I will have a copy The Incredible Hulk # 102 ? No . Gender , the first edition of his first series Which were ignominiously eliminated in 1963 ? I understand you interested ? Definitely , yes ! Type your number in my phone And I 'll call you when it happens . Sting on my signal . In three , two , one , go ! We have already been there , Cameron . I have to go further in memory of Jamie . I found a hot spot . Get ready . Wait . Something is wrong . I see two different memories overlap . Jamie Green at the Basketball ... And Jamie in a lab ? - What lab ? - You can set the image ? I see the anomaly . I 'll try anything . There you go . You always see double ? It 's stable . I am in a research lab of sorts . Half the time . Jamie talking to a woman . What is a boy like that doing here ? What is Jamie doing here ? They can navigate on the surface of the water , Consuming oil hydrocarbons half the time . Jamie was a scientist . I thought he was ... It was , but here he speaks of hydrocarbons . For when you think be able to reproduce your nanobots ? Two weeks ? I still do some changes in the program . Jamie worked at MeriCorp Energy . This is an oil company With a research center in Pasadena . I found another hot spot . Hold . It 's going to move . Give it to me . It is the time of death underwater . Ejects up ! There was a scientist Who worked on the nanobot technology MeriCorp for Energy . Something went wrong And tries to protect it . - And drowning ? - Someone jammed code . There he fell of the cliff into the water . Except he survived , but he suffered brain damage . Yesterday when the body was found ... This time he was really dead . No matter what Jamie was working on at MeriCorp Energy That 's what killed him . Talk nanobots . Slides , programmable machines self-reproducing . It is known for the nanobots . There are several of us . Hi . I speak . So our nanobots , programmed by the quantum computer . They are circulated in our subjects To fill the holes in their synapses . This is what operates the sting . Now , during the sting , you said you heard Jamie Talk of hydrocarbons ? Time for a little history . Almost there 5 years I went out with this worker platforms called Dirk . Dirk ? You were dating a Dirk ? What 's he doing here ? All . Let me elaborate . - My ex-boyfriend , Dirk ... - Wow .. I thought you just go out with him . Now it 's your ex ? We still talk . Dirk said there was a company Who was working on a technology to prevent oil spills Using nanobots hydrocarbon eaters . I bet Jamie developing this technology MeriCorp for Energy , but accidentally Nanobots have its consumed carbon instead of the hydrocarbon . Carbon , as he lives in the living tissue , as in ... - People . - It 's worse than that . Guys , human we all know are not alone Life forms based on carbon on the planet . The plants , animals , insects , Everyone in the food chain . What if these nanobots are duplicated , They will not stop Until they run out of food . So , we are talking about gender , a world pulp . - Where you going ? - To mistreat a bear . Nothing . So you 're out with a person called Dirk ? Dirk and I went out together a week . I went out with her sister for a little longer . Wait , sister ? What ? - Kirsten , we need to talk . - Okay . When we go up there , I will charge the " Who the hell killed Jamie ? " ... And you talk about nanobots . I mean , we need to talk . Last night , when you were with me , You were a little ... A little what ? One second ? I know , okay ? Shut up . The Incredible Hulk # 102 ? You are great ! This ... No , you 're ... Yes . And funny . Yes . Sorry . Just ... Second . Nina , you 're ... you 're a little broken . Can you ... Can you hear me ? Hi . I was wondering if you could help me . I love you speak of a scientific named Jamie B. It works in nano technology . Excuse me . I heard you . I am Jamison Barrett - But they call me .. - Jamie B. How to be you best for our nanobots initiative ? We need to talk . Come into my office . No worries . After 20 : 30 , that 's fine , if it also suits you . Where are ... I was the leader bioengineer hydrocarbon team , And I was only peripheral involvement nanobot in the group . I 'm not sure I 'll be able help . Who is this person on your left this photo ? This is Dr. Steven Benning . There .. IT worked here ? Until it disappears . For over a year . What happened to him ? It is not sure . His car was found on PCH But was never found . It is never returned home , never touched his bank accounts . Steve was stressed at work , So the police think he just took time . Running away from his problems . I guess that 's the reason why I have difficulty in accepting it . Who are you ? Why are you talking to Dr. Barrett ? In fact , it is you who I have to talk . I 'm a big fan of the nanobot technology Encrypted encoding complex . Dr Barrett , strategic planning session will begin . You should go . Who are you and what do you want ? I the encrypted code you need to open The storage device that Dr. Benning closed . I do not know what you mean . Call me just an idea And want to do business . I 'll find out . Millie ! What 's up ? You 're early . I was hungry . His home is my home , not ? No , no . My home is my home . Key to it and I 'll finish . Restores it to Linus . It will not happen . Why not say to your toy boy Than making you go fight not so well . And while you do that , tells Linus that he should Thank me for teaching him to be less confident . You have more toilet paper . Arise . Restores it to Linus . Now . Who she thinks ? A give me orders . Who do you think I am ? I think I 'm the NSA . FYI Jamie B. , our Jamie B. , Was actually Dr. Steven Benning . He was head of MeriCorp Energy The nanobots program B. and Jamie really Dr. Jamison Barrett . The woman to whom you spoke today Without me even though I was downright next to you ? Wait , like when you talked to Nina ? Nina works at the comic store . It called about an order Whatever . In short , I think Dr. Benning took the name of Jamie B. Because even if he had forgotten everything else , He could ever forget . Linus . Hello . I watched the security images you had . I ironed images Images At the exact moment you said . All I see is Jamie B. Helping a woman with her shopping , But there in no man with a red hat here . But that 's impossible . I know I 've seen in two different bites . - Look again . - I 've already done it . The Remade . It must be there . It was there . I know there was . Moving a market . Kirsten told Naomi Burke she encryption code And did a market to give it . This is tricky . If we can do that Burke offers us money ... Can turn around and stop . Burke and security guard have killed a man . - Twice . - She will not give money Without proof that the code works . You can not prove it without decrypt it . Any idea what kind of Benning encryption key used ? A 2048-bit key SSL . You guys are geniuses . How much it can be hard to crack A 2048-character code ? Using a classical computer Only 400,000 times longer than the universe has existed . But with the help of our quantum computer , You can do that twice as fast . Kay , not geniuses . But Dr. Benning was . One has to think like him . I heard the music in the Benning memory When programming code . Music is mathematical . Do you remember the song ? Not well . Swells block the old temporal dysplasia . Hi , I 'm a traveling magneto , remember ? I can not just replay memories . You remember at least what kind of music was it ? Jazz . It sounded like jazz . - An idea . - What are you looking for ? The jazz songs with 2,048 notes . Perhaps Benning used the song as encryption key . What ? There are four possibilities . Let me listen . That 's it . This is the song . Kiss me Now , recorded in 1949 by Cal Metzinger . I 'll download the music quantum computer . I 'll reschedule to convert all 2048 notes The color range for the corresponding numbers And ... We ourselves an encryption key . Perhaps geniuses . Thank you . Then you can download the code from quantum computer On a USB key so I could sell it to Naomi . Wait . There is talk of a code that could unlock A horde of ravenous nanobots flesh . If something went wrong ? Cameron is right . I will not send you there . Our quantum computer using nanobots ? If Dr. Benning reprograms its nanobots , Why not reprogram our own ? To do what ? I was really hoping that Kirsten was wearing a microphone . Naomi expect it though . On the monitors . You should be fine . Once the exchange is made on the recovers . Ok So , hypothetically , if a guy wanted Escape the area friend Before it 's too late ... God , more sex advice . But the girl is not even sure love me ... And ... And you want to know if this connection is Love or a great friendship ? Is that it ? I do not know , buddy . It 's different for everyone . What I can tell you from personal experience Some people make the best friends they make good couples . Now stop your fuss . Naomi is there . I 'm not connected . One is never too careful . You have no idea how far People would go to steal corporate secrets . I can imagine . That 's why I 'm curious . How did you get the encryption key ? This is my business . And it is this market or not ? I am always happy to help another woman To get its share of the American pie . You have my key ? You have my pie ? In fact , there is an alley behind . It 's a little less public . I love public . I go . Something is wrong . It does not trade . Come with me , and we did our market share . Stay here , and enjoying your dinner . Wait . Look . Let 's give him a minute . Should trust him . That 's me . Now show me yours . Not so fast . I have to ensure that the code works . The unit is in the lab . Let 's take a little trip . After you have your money . Something is seriously wrong . How long it takes to move briefcase ? I agree . Let 's go . Go . Shit ! There is a green monkey van-de-vomit parked downstairs . If you look inside , you will find everything What Theo stole from you . Everything . You stole his van when he was not looking ? I 'm not one to brag , you know me , But I kicked his ass Theo ! Style ... Boots-kick ? Like , imagine a purple softball In the area where her gaping forehead was there before . You are great ! Thank you , thank you . No , listen to me . Thank you . If you had not been so nice , And so confident I could never let Theo behind me . I 'm sorry . I was caught in the moment ... And ... And I thought maybe ... I just had to close the van . It goes away . - I hate peas . - Sorry . Do not door for me . It 's good . Let 's go . It was stalled without the code . It should not be a concern there . What are you doing ? What is she doing ? I do not know . They came in my apartment and told me to come . I thought you 'd like to see The work of Dr. Benning in action . I knew that all the two were close . Let her . Give me the key . Barrett has nothing to do with it . I was not aware that still negotiating . Key . You see ? I told you that I had . Now let us go . You can not go there . You 'll miss the best part : Testing . Let 's liberate 100 nanobots . Impressive . MeriCorp Energy invented a deodorant . Keep looking . Transfer applesauce . Thank you for the demonstration . Now let us ... Nothing personal , But our customers do not want any complications . What buyers ? Naomi , what 's going on ? Dr. Benning erroneously reprogrammed nanobots To consume carbon based materials . Naomi here decided to turn it into a weapon . That 's why she killed him . You killed Steve ? Monte . You never thought that if these nanobots Were released worldwide all , Including you reduce the world to a pulp ? She 's lying . Oh , my god . You 're so naive . I knew you were not going to cooperate . You see , what you feel now are the nanobots Building a stronger connection between the synapses in your brain . Unfortunately for you , Your synapses do not need stronger connections So your brain bypass . But do not worry , the bots are programmed To stop after a few hours . You nanobots ? Course . Everyone ? Were infected USB stick With our nanobots . When they manipulated Nanobots entered in their bodies through the skin . But they have not affected you . Was rescheduled our nanobots to avoid my DNA . They are still unconscious But I think they 're fine . It does not deserve to be . They killed Steve . They can no longer hurt anyone . Good job . I 'll meet you later . How was Steve ? After he forgot who he was . It was a good person . He was kind and loving and it hath never forgotten . He kept a diary and there wrote your name Again and again , and that 's why we thought his name was Jamie B. He remembers other things ? A song . The song went ... The first time we kissed . You okay ? I do not think it is fair that I make you wait . You say that there is no reason for me to wait ? No , I say ... I do not want things to be weird between us And I want to protect our friendship . This is what I am ? - Your friend ? - No . You 're my best friend . See you tomorrow . I present number of 102 The Incredible Hulk . This is a great moment . History . You are now the envy of every fan girls and boys everywhere . Please . Thank you . Thank you for having brought . You 're very lucky . A chance like this does this once in a lifetime . What ... What are you doing ? You mean apart distribute the holy grail Comics Fan to a friend ? Nothing . You want to go get a something to eat ? Unless it is too late . It is not too late . No . So I heard son of the tailor . His father died 5 years ago . He left records ? No . It 's another dead end . Good . Do not be discouraged , kid . You 're smart . You 'll find another way . Kirsten , you were great today . It was a victory . Thank Fisher .

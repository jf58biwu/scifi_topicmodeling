 Big jim : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . Well , the sooner you become his mate , the sooner he 'll be What i need him to be : A protector . You and i , we 're part of something greater . You 're one of us . I 'm sorry , but i 'll never be able to be who you want . What happened ? What do i do ? Get me to the caves . ( grunts ) Julia : Did that star just hit us ? Oh , my god . Looks like a meteor ! Norrie : We have a way to fight the kinship . How ? Emotion . You all sure you want to do this ? Like you even need to ask , red . Then the resistance starts here . Junior : Christine 's in there 'cause of you . When she comes out , you 're gonna answer for what you did . We 're all that 's left . At least we have food . Yeah , if that 's what you call this mystery meat . So this is my army ? A cripple , two horny teenagers and a plucky newspapergirl ? We 're the best you 've got . Yeah , world 's over . Sam took out christine , the town 's on its own . We need a plan . We find a way to use emotion . It 's the only way to fight what everyone 's infected with . I 'll take bullets over group hugs , okay ? We found guns , we ought to use ' em . You do realize we 're outnumbered . Yeah , and they have weapons , too . And why would you want To shoot everyone when they can be saved ? Because i don 't know if anyone who came out of those cocoons Is worth saving . And that includes you three . I 'm going into town to see how everyone 's Coping without christine . All right . We 're coming with you . Yeah , you need someone to watch your back . Hunter , Keep working on cracking the passcode To christine 's recorder . Whatever she said could give us an advantage . Big jim : No , no- - he stays , i 'm staying . I 'm not gonna let some pod person Stay here alone with our supplies . All right . Set these to channel three . We 'll keep you updated on what we find . You really think , uh , this little recon mission 's The best use of our time ? I think if there 's even A shred of hope for the people we care about , we have to try . Don 't stop . ( grunts ) Sam ... How far you 've fallen . Well , you deserved it . ( grunts ) I 'd do it again . Ah ! I could kill him . ( sam choking ) just a quick snap , And he 's no longer a problem . No , i have other plans for him . Just kill me . I 'll never help you . Don 't worry . I can bring you around . ( choking ) He should be out for a while , but we need A private space to work with him where we won 't be disturbed . Our fallout shelter 's perfect . What 's wrong ? I 'm not fully healed . I used most of our energy supply And oxytocin just to get back on my feet . ( sighs ) I don 't know if it was worth the cost . The kinship was lost while you were gone . You made the right choice . They need you . Do you feel different ? I feel like a weight 's been lifted . Did you see that ? Eva : Dale , what 's happening ? I have no idea . Joe . Look at the sky ! It 's coming back . Julia , pull over ! ( birds singing ) It 's like a tv screen , Changing channels back and forth . From what 's real to what 's not . ( people whistling tune ) There you go . I 'm okay . No way . ( crackling noises ) How can she still be alive ? She must have gone into a cocoon After she was stabbed . When barbie came out of one , all of his wounds were healed . Christine : I know that there 's been A lot of confusion over the past 24 hours . But the destruction that you witnessed Outside the dome wasn 't real . It was an illusion . I projected it on the dome As a crucible , meant to bring us all together . To strengthen us for the tasks to come . If we could just show them how many times she 's lied to them ... No , logic won 't work . They 're accepting Everything she says without question . There are amethysts in these tunnels That need to be brought to the surface . We 've got some mining to do . Even barbie 's buying it . So is my mom . Gather any picks or shovels you can find at town hall And meet back here . Christine has some sort of a schematic in her office . I don 't know what it 's for , But those amethysts are definitely part of it . Well , joe and i can go find the schematic . Okay . Go now , while christine 's still here . Take my car . Once you find it , get it to bird island . We 'll see if we can make sense of it . It might be the key to her whole plan . You know what ? Give me your walkie . Mine 's running low on batteries . What are you going to do ? ( burst of static ) Keep an eye on the mining operation . See what kind of information i can gather here . All right . ( sighs ) What happened ? ( exhales ) The situation is more complex than i let on . Yesterday , sam stabbed me . I only survived because james found me And brought me to the tunnels . Well , you want me to track sam down ? Oh , he 's already in custody . I need you to spearhead the mining operation . So why do we need these amethysts ? They power the dome . Like batteries . The egg kept them charged , But when it was destroyed , The amethysts began to lose their energy . And i used most of what energy was left To heal myself and to create the illusion That brought us together . If we bring the amethysts above ground , I 'm hoping we can recharge them . And if we can 't ? The dome 's surface will calcify . Everyone inside would suffocate . Okay . Well , then , we 'd better get started . Eva , i need you to set up a lunch station nearby So everyone can be fed without slowing down the work . Well , now , hold on . If you 're gonna be on your own , I want you to get a gun . We may have sam , But who knows what other threats are out there ? Eva : That 's not a bad idea . I 'll grab one in town hall . The two of you seem closer than ever . Have you slept together ? Yes . But i don 't think he 's completed his transformation . You 're doing all the right things . Don 't worry . It 's just a matter of time . Look outside . Apocalypse has been canceled . Not the first time the dome lied to us . Skies are clear . We might be able to get a signal . There 's a message ... Sent last night . " emergency protocol . Confirm receipt And identity with employee access code . " Put in your access code . You worked for aktaion . Hunter may . How goes dome life ? Do i know you ? Lily walters . Your disappearing act got me a promotion . What happened last night ? The whole dome turned black until a few minutes ago . Our satellites couldn 't see inside . So no meteors landed ? The world is ... Fine ? Enough of your chit-chat . Hey . I need to talk to the man in charge . I monitor all communication in and out of the dome , So you talk to me until i say otherwise . You think i don 't know who you are ? James rennie , sr . Aka big jim . Last update has you in dr . Marston 's custody . And now you 're free , and i can 't reach him . You 've been a bad boy again , jimmy ? I 'm one of the few good ones left . The people here are infected By whatever came out of that meteor egg , They killed your team . Marston 's still alive . Those , uh , freaks captured him . Now , i formed a resistance , and i can get him back , But , uh , we 're gonna need something from you first . Like what ? Care package . Hold on . ( whispering ) : Didn 't you kill dr . Marston ? Yeah , but she doesn 't know that . The satellites can 't see indoors . Okay , i can 't make any promises , but what do you need ? Well , we managed to salvage some firearms , But those won 't be enough . So first we need something that 's more explosive . So we 're gonna split up into two groups , all right ? This group right here , You 're gonna chisel the amethysts out of the cave wall . Grab some tools . You guys , you 're gonna help us build A winch and pulley system over top of this hole So we can lift the amethysts out . Got it ? Let 's get to it . Come on . What the hell ? Julia ( over walkie ) : Barbie ? Barbie . I thought i made myself clear . You 're not welcome here . Julia : Don 't speak , just listen . Look , i know you 're angry with me , But i need you to think about something . When you were in the cocoons , why did it make me dead And have you fall in love with eva ? Jealousy doesn 't suit you , julia . Please just hear me out . That alternate reality needed to pull you away from me . Have you thought about why ? Well , i 'm guessing you have a theory . You 're being manipulated to be part of this kinship . The man i love should see right through that . Don 't turn away from us , from what we have . What we had is in the past . It should still matter to you . Look , what i have now with eva There 's no more tension , no more drama . We can just be . But do you really ... Love her ? Eva : Hey . What are you doing out here ? Well , i ... Thought i saw a deer . Eva : Too bad you didn 't shoot it . Could have had it for lunch . Come on . Junior , let me up . You 're not leaving until christine says so . You 're not yourself , junior . You were infected . But you and i can fight this- - we 're family . My family is the problem . Crazy mother , narcissistic father , drunk uncle . I 'm part of the kinship now . For the first time , i have a real family . Restrain his arm . Ow ! Aah ! What are you doing to me ? Thank you , james , i can take it from here . Barbie could use Another strong pair of hands back at the crater . This is all for your own good , sam . Good boy . Good boy . You 're not like the rest Of those cocoon whack-jobs , are you ? I was for a while until ... Till what ? You fell off a roof and decided to have feelings about it ? Nothing like breaking your spine to remind you Of the most traumatic experience of your life . Short version : My mom died in front of me . Slowly and in agony . My pain reminded me of that day . Also made me remember who i am . Be skeptical if you want , but i know she brought me back . ( computer chirps ) lily : Hi , fellas . ( indy whimpers ) Took your time , though , didn 't you , sweetheart ? My boss needed some convincing , But he agreed to your plan to free dr . Marston . Care package is on the way . Pleasure doing business with you , buttercup . Hey , julia , i 'm on my way into town . Did you find out anything useful ? Yeah , the world 's still out there . Yeah , i picked up on that . Any idea what that was all about ? Christine did it . As soon as the sky turned back to blue , She came out of the tunnels , alive and well . Now she 's got the town mining those amethysts . Joe and norrie are trying to figure out why . Who cares why ? Meet me at the high school . I know how to deal with this . Anything happens to my dog , I 'm gonna break your arms and throw you in the lake . There 's not much gas left . If we charge the battery , we can make it last longer . Watch out . Keep your eyes open . I think christine , she may have sent some people back here . Come on , we got this . We sneak in , we get the schematic , and we get out . Desk . Joe , come here . I think i found something . That 's got to be it . It 's like stonehenge , except squiggly . All right , let 's get out of here . Hey , julia , we 've got the schematic . Copy that . Norrie : Look , there 's my mom . Whoa , hey , what are you doing ? Julia needs this . If we get my mom alone , we can convert her . We want her on our side . What is that ? Turns out aktaion 's actually good for something . After the dome cleared , hunter reestablished contact with them , And then i negotiated , and they , uh , sent this up to the lake . What did they want in exchange for all these explosives ? They want us to , uh , free dr . Marston From his kinship kidnappers . And , uh , in case anyone asks , I did not slit that little weasel 's throat . At least we have what we need To , uh , take care of christine 's mining operation . You want to use it all at once , Or you want to save some for a rainy day ? Nothing good came out of those tunnels . We use it all at once . We 're not gonna let christine rise from the grave again . You know , if this plan works Some people are gonna die . This is war . Man : Up , up . Man 2 : Keep going , keep going . We got this . Almost there . All right , place it down . So ... You and eva ? Barbie : Come on , junior . I 'm a gentleman . Do i have a sign on my back ? No , i 'm not trying to pry , I just think you guys are meant for each other . And that 's what it 's all about , right ? Yep , that 's it . Eleanor , where have you two been ? Remember my first day of second grade ? When i took a red marker to my face And i pretended i had chicken pox ? Eleanor , you need to come with me . No , no , listen to me . Both of you knew i was lying . But you still took care of me Because you knew that i was scared And that i needed my moms . And now i need you again . I know you have emotions . I know it . Show me . You 're wasting valuable time . The kinship needs our help . Norrie , this is not working . Nope . Change of plans . It was your fault that mom died . If you hadn 't forced me to go to that stupid reform school , Then we wouldn 't have even been here in the first place . She was always the one that i thought of As my real mom anyway . She gave birth to me . We had a stronger connection . And we didn 't tell you , But we both talked about it all the time . ( whistles tune ) Norrie ... That time i slept over at michelle caldwell 's house , We actually went to an all-night rave in long beach . We hitchhiked . ( continues whistling ) Joe : Norrie , this is not working . I did drugs . Mom , joe and i are having sex . Say something , mom ! Say something . Take them to the tunnels And put them to work . Please ... Get off me ! Get off ! Get off me ! Mom , please ! Joe : Let go ! Mom , no , please ! Mom ! Mom ! Sam : Please stop . You 've taken too much of my blood already . It 's time to give some back . You 're transfusing me ? If you give me the wrong blood type , It 'll kill me . I 'm type o . Universal donor . That 's your blood ? It 's a gift . I 'm giving you what you need to return to us . I 'll never be a part of the kinship . The life force is already inside you . This is just a boost . You 'll feel much better when you stop fighting it . ( grunting ) I 'm seriously gonna get black lung . Keep your eyes open , norrie . We 'll find a way to escape . ( bell ringing ) all right , listen up ! Eva has set up a food station . But after you eat , We 'll finish up with this amethyst . Not you two . Well , what about lunch ? You can miss one meal . These amethysts are necessary for our survival . All right . Up ! You can start bringing it over . All right , let it down . They 've already got one of them Out of the tunnels . All right , everybody take a break ; go get you some lunch . We 'll come back to this afterwards . They 're clearing out for chow time . This is our chance . Barbie : Will you guys do me a favor and hang here ? Keep an eye on these tunnels , Make sure no one heads down there ? Julia : Only three guards . We can handle that . ( unzips bag ) If i draw them away , You think you can plant the explosives and get out in time ? Yeah , not a problem . There 's no turning back after this , red . If we do this , They 're gonna hit us back hard . I 'm ready . Yeah , could be barbie leading the charge . I 'm not dying 'cause you can 't pull the trigger on your boyfriend . Maybe it never comes to that . Yeah , well , if it does , you 'd better not hesitate . 'cause i won 't . I get it , jim . When the job 's done , we 'll meet back at the dock . Good luck . Sam : Please , no more . We can stop the transfusion , but first tell me , Does your old life- - your human life - - Actually have value ? I help people . Who have you really helped ? Have you saved anyone ? Your sister pauline ? Angie mcalister ? And poor , lost abby dewitt- - Where is she now ? You even tried To kill me , sam . And all i ever wanted to do was to help you . All you have to show for your time on earth Is the shame Of your human failings . Stop struggling , And all your shame will disappear . You 'd be welcomed . You 'd finally have value . It 's time to let go of your pain . I forgive you . The choice is yours , sam . I hope you make the right one . ¶ ¶ ( muffled gurgling ) ( beeps ) All right , one down . ( sighs ) ( beeps ) ( beeps ) ( beeps ) ( beeps ) ( beeps ) What is that- - fire ? Look , the guard ! There 's no pulse . Where are the other two guards ? The smoke was a diversion . I saw julia in the woods this morning . She was planning something the whole time . The amethysts . We only have one . Okay . All right . Stay up here . Make sure no one comes down after me . ( grunting ) What are you doing here ? You killed that guard , didn 't you ? That guard 's the least of your worries . I rigged those tunnels with enough explosives To blow us both to kingdom come . We got to clear out of here . Let 's go . If you don 't tell me where the bombs are , You 'll die right here . Listen . Not long ago , you wanted an apology from me , And i never gave it to you . I failed you , son . Mm-mm , don 't call me that . I 'm not your son anymore . ( chuckles ) You know , i ... I said that to my father Once when i was your age . I tried so hard not to become him , But i just kept the cycle going . Pushed all that hurt onto you . I never let you be your own man . I am so ... Sorry ... James . I am my own man now . I moved on when i burned your house down . So , if you 're done crying Like a little girl , show me where the bombs are . Fine . Just follow me . Julia : Hunter ? Have joe and norrie help you Pack anything useful from the house . We 're gonna need to clear out . Uh , joe and norrie aren 't back yet . I haven 't heard from them in a while . Okay , i 'll go look for them . Do what you can in the meantime . Eva : You shouldn 't be here . This is what it 's come to ? We gonna gun each other down in the street ? I 'm guessing you 're not a very good shot . But either way , you lose . Oh , yeah , how 's that ? You 're too late . Dale and i are bonded now . If you kill me , the man you love Will never forgive you . What do you know about love ? Are you even capable of feeling it ? Love is a human construct . It has no value for the kinship . ( grunting ) ( coughs ) I truly am sorry . Eva : People like you and jim rennie- - You 'll be left behind . Dale and i , we 're the future . What you have is built on a lie . What barbie and i have is real . ( panting ) ( timer beeping ) ( beeping stops ) ( timer beeping ) I don 't have to kill you . Everybody get out ! There 's bombs in the tunnel ! ( in distance ) : Get out ! Get out ! Hey . What 's that yelling ? Get out ! Everybody get out , there 's bombs in the tunnel ! Drop everything ! Everybody get out ! There 's bombs in the tunnel ! Get out , there 's bombs in the tunnel ! When barbie finally breaks free of this , He 's gonna choose me . It 's why i 'll keep fighting for him . It 's why i 'll win . ( gunshot , explosion ) ( julia grunts ) ( gunshots ) Norrie ! Stop ! ( panting ) Norrie ? Norrie , where are you ? I 'm here , i 'm here . Oh . Oh ... ( sniffs ) You saved me from that blast . You 're my daughter . Mom ... ( carolyn moans ) You 're back . ( groans ) Help me ! ( crying ) : Get this off of her . What happened to me ? I 'm so sorry . Joe : I can 't move this . Norrie : No , i should be the one apologizing . All those things that i said ... I didn 't mean them . ( rumbling ) I was just trying To snap you out of it , and ... ( sobs ) I was lying . ( sobbing ) Joe : Norrie , we have to hurry . These tunnels are gonna collapse . You have to get out of here . No , mom , i 'm not leaving you . There 's no time . You have to go . Now . I said no ! That 's my girl . Such a fighter . Keep her safe , joe , Keep her safe ! I will . I will , i promise . I love you so much , mom . ( sobbing ) I love you , too , baby girl . ( rumbling ) Go , joe ! No , no . Go , joe ! Mom , please don 't leave me ! Go ! Joe : We have to go now . No ... We have to go now ! Come on . ( groans ) Easy , annie oakley . What happened ? Are you bleeding ? No , that was somebody else . Look , as much as i 'd like to stick around And watch the people of whoville cry About their precious tunnels going boom , We gotta get back to bird island . Not yet . Joe and norrie are missing . ( grunts ) Barbie . You okay ? Ah ... There were bombs . ( groans ) Lots of bombs . ( exhales ) Big jim did this . Of course he did . ( norrie grunts ) Help ! Somebody ! Who is that ? Joe : Down here ! Come here . ( norrie sobbing ) Is there anybody else down there ? My mom . Come on , norrie . It 's not safe . Let 's go . You can 't call yourself " the new hunter . " The old hunter is still here , thank you very much . I didn 't come up with the name . They gave me your workstation And people started calling me that on their own . Wait , wait , did they swap out my pc ? Nope . And by the way , It took me no time at all to find all your " hidden " files . There was a disturbing amount of hentai in there . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . I-it was there to hide my actual secret files . Sure . Seriously . No , no , no . The file labeled " tentacles " Has my password-cracking algorithm in it . Is there any way you could send it to me ? I 've been busting my ass trying to rewrite it from memory . Hiding secrets in the porn . I 'm almost impressed . Sending the algorithm now . ( alarms blaring ) What 's going on ? They 're here . I need you to hold on to some files for safekeeping . I gotta wipe this drive . " they " ? Who 's " they " ? Whoa ! Gotta go . Good luck , hunter may . Wait ! Lily ! Stop , joe , i can 't go anymore . ( wailing ) norrie ... When i came here ... ( sniffs ) ... I had two moms that loved me . And now i have no one . What ? No . You have me here , norrie . And i love you . Well , that 's just great . What ? Uh , n ... Norrie , we have to go . Where ? We 're under a freaking dome . Now ! Get in ! Joe : Let 's go , come on ! I stashed the car at sam 's cabin . Still no sign of him . We should keep looking , though . He could be an ally . There are no allies left in chester 's mill . Those people may be infected , but they 're not lost . I 'm not giving up on barbie . Well , you should . Poured my damn heart out to junior . It 's useless . Emotion doesn 't work . Norrie : It does work . I got through to my mom . For a moment , she was herself again . Why only a moment ? Because she 's dead . She was trapped . She made us leave her behind . Joe : We barely got out Before the tunnels collapsed . Norrie : My mom sacrificed herself So that her child could live , And there 's nothing more human than that . You set off those bombs , didn 't you ? You had no idea What was down there . What were you thinking ? There 's no regrets in war , red . Here 's your schematic . ¶ ¶ These amethysts were essential . We 'll find a way to push on . Has sam come back to us ? Depends how much fight is left in him . But if you provide people with the right lie , They 'll believe what they want to . For this town , it was an image Of the end of the world . With sam , All it took was a pint of his own blood . See ? Not a scratch . And my forgiveness . ( sighs ) That 's the only one left . How did this happen ? Blame big jim . Eva : And julia . Thank god i had a gun . Otherwise she would have killed me . She tried to hurt you ? I found her fleeing from the crater . She started shooting at me , So i fired a shot in the air So she 'd take cover And then i ran . I barely got away . She 's obsessed with you , dale . She 's not going to stop . This is my fault . I saw julia this morning . I ... She-she told me that she was just here to talk , And i believed her . She didn 't care if i died in those caves . I could have stopped her , and i didn 't . The actions of this resistance Have threatened our very survival . The time has passed for peaceful coexistence . We need to strike back . We need to kill them all .

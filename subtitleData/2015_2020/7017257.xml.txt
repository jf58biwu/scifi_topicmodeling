 That hurt . Yeah , it hurts . But the fact that I feel anything at all is what 's blowing my mind . Think that 's the point . All right , that 's enough . Well ? Unbelievable . It 's like the real thing . I could even smell the sweat . But I-I felt strangely cold , though . Well , I tried to make the simulation as real as possible , and since you always leave the air-con on in the base , I exaggerated it . Kind of like a silent protest . That was so realistic .

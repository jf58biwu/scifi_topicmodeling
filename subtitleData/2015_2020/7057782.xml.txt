 Lotor 's cruiser is on the other side of the planet . At our current rate of speed , we 'll be within attack range in an hour . Good . Hold formation . [ grunts ] Oh , apologies , Hunk ! Mm , is attacking right now such a good idea ? You know , since not everyone is so great with their lions ? Do you mean me , specifically ? You ? No . No way , I didn 't- - I 'm just simply pointing out that more than half of the team are in new lions . Maybe now 's not a great time to bite off more than we can chew . [ Lance ] You can blame our hot-headed leader for that one . First , you want me to lead , and then you complain about how I do it . Prince Lotor is the heir to the Galra throne . We could end his reign right now . Allura , you doing okay in Blue ? I 'm fine . I 've been flying the Castle for half my life . I just need a few ticks to adjust to the lion . Good ... because we 're going in . [ beeping ] The lions will be on us in one varga . What are your orders ? I say we turn around and start shooting . We just learned all five lions are operational . There 's still much we don 't know . Keep the cruiser on this heading until my return . Ready my fighter . I 'm going to attack the lions myself . You 'll never take them all out alone . I 'm not trying to . I 'm detecting movement . [ Lance ] So much for the element of surprise . It 's just a single fighter . Where 's the rest of them ? Probably scrambling as we speak . Let 's take it out . [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ grunts ] Lance , what are you doing ? Sorry ! Red here is a lot faster than I 'm used to . Uh , where 'd that fighter go ? Come on , move ! [ groans ] I can 't shake him . Someone get this guy off my tail . [ Pidge ] Coming in on your six . [ groans ] - Allura ! - I 'm sorry , Keith ! [ gasps ] Seriously , does this thing have brakes ? [ groans ] [ groans ] [ groans ] Allura ! Allura ! [ both yelling ] Whoa ! What 's up with this guy ? He 's playing us against ourselves . - [ Keith ] It 's gotta be Lotor . - Ow . Allura , you okay over there ? I 'm fine , but these controls are not responding , not like the Castle . What 's wrong with you , Lion ? Do as I command ! Move ! Maybe someone should suggest to Allura that flying the lion is different than flying the Castle . Hey , I already told her yelling at her lion wouldn 't work . Didn 't go over well . She yelled at me , too . Yeah , count me out . She scares me when she 's under pressure . - I can hear you . - [ all scream ] [ Pidge ] Keith , what should we do ? How about this ? Everyone stay out of my way ! [ sarcastically ] Great . Great leadership . - [ grunts ] - [ lion growls ] Okay , this isn 't working . We need to form Voltron . Everyone ! In formation ! Uh , guys ? Guys , I 'm not really feeling that Voltron feeling ! Keep going ! It 's not happening ! [ growls ] What is going on ? Guys ! Fighter ! [ all grunt ] How disappointing . It appears that the reality of Voltron does not live up to the legend . [ Lance ] Well , that was embarrassing . [ Hunk ] So ... should we call it quits ? Maybe go back , regroup , get a meal ? No ! I know everyone is struggling , but we can 't let Lotor slip away . Acxa , set course for these coordinates . I 'm going to lure the lions there . Thayserix ? Why ? These are not the paladins who defeated my father . [ Ezor ] What ? How do you know ? They do not fight as a unit and are unable to form Voltron . Perhaps my father did as much damage to their team as they did to him . Whatever the case , they 're vulnerable and we need to take advantage . [ Acxa ] Recalibrating your fighter to adjust for the atmospheric changes on Thayserix now . What ? What happens on Thayserix ? The planet is made of dense gases and has unusual magnetic poles that distort and wreak havoc on normal sensors . Oh ... So , once the lions are there , they 'll be blind . - No offense , Narti . - [ growls ] Keep the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix . I 'll flush the lions out one by one for you to capture . He 's trying to hide from us . [ Pidge ] We may not want to follow him . We don 't know what 's in there . Huh ? [ Pidge 's voice breaking up ] Guys , we have a problem . My sensors are going crazy . I think it 's due to this planet 's atmosphere and what must be strange magnetic poles . We can 't worry about that now . I 'm not letting this guy get away . [ Pidge ] Keith , without accurate sensors or working equipment , we 're not gonna be able to tell what 's up or down , where we are , or how to get out . - I say we fall back . - No , keep going . - [ Keith 's voice breaking up ] ... going . - [ Hunk ] What ? All I heard was " going . " Are we going back ? Is anyone else getting this static ? I 'm losing visuals on you all . I need you to slow down ! [ Keith ] We gotta keep up . He 's getting away ! Guys , I think this gas is messing with our radios . We gotta stay close if we want to be able to communicate . [ static crackling ] I think we made it through the worst of it . [ screams ] [ static crackling ] [ gasps ] No ! No ! [ roars ] - Allura took a hit . I 'm going after her . - [ Keith ] Hunk ! [ Keith groans ] The rest of you , stay on me ! [ Lance ] Keith , we have to go back for Allura . [ growling ] Keith , you 're splitting up the team ! Keith , don 't do this ! - [ yells ] - [ lion growls ] Stop toying with them ! Bring the pain ! Is everyone okay ? I 'm sorry that I slowed us down , but the Blue Lion isn 't listening to me . It 's okay . We 're a team . We stick together . - Isn 't that right , Keith ? - It 's not about the team . We have a mission that 's more important than any one of us . We need to find Lotor and stop him , and I plan on doing that right now . [ Lance sighs ] Come on , guys . We 'd better stick together . [ static crackling ] [ whimpering ] [ chuckles ] Prince Lotor requires your assistance on Planet Thayserix . We expect you here immediately . Lotor is right on top of the lions . They have no idea . [ Zethrid ] Why isn 't he firing ? He could be tearing them to shreds right now . - Blow them up , Lotor ! - He can 't . The area he 's in is full of Red Syntian Nitrate , a highly combustible gas that reacts violently to amplified emissions of light . [ chuckles ] This is gonna be good . This is crazy ! We can 't see a thing . Stay together . He 's around here somewhere . I know it . There ! - [ Allura ] Where did he go ? - [ Pidge ] No clue . Our radars are worthless in here . Hey , is it just me , or does anyone else get the feeling this guy is just toying with us ? I 'm with you , big guy . I 'm getting a case of the heebie-jeebies . - He must have lured us here on purpose . - Up there ! [ all scream ] We need to get out of here . We 've been led into a trap . The tables have turned . He 's flipped the script . The hunters have become the hunted . Hunk , shouting taglines is getting us nowhere ! Lance is right . Remain calm and get ready . He 's gonna attack again . Everyone , circle up . We need to be prepared for anything . As soon as you see him , fire with everything you 've got . Now ! Fire ! [ screams ] [ screams ] Hello ? Paladins , help ! I am impressed that you 're able to hide , but I will find you . [ panting ] [ growling ] What happened back there ? Where 's the rest of the team ? This is all my fault . I followed him right into this trap . Everyone warned me , but I didn 't listen . I put the entire team in jeopardy . Yeah , you kinda did . But now we gotta fix it . You 're right . Let 's go . Hello ? Anyone ? [ static crackling ] [ gasps ] Oh ... [ screams ] [ Pidge 's voice breaking up ] Is anyone there ? Hello ? Pidge ! Hunk ! Oh , my gosh ! OMG . I 'm so glad I found you . Okay , what kind of computer-y stuff can you do to fix the radar , find everyone and get us all out of here ? Actually , I can 't recalibrate my system without a data constant , which I could have gotten had we not rushed into this gas planet . So , what are you saying ? I 'm saying ... we 're stuck . [ gulps ] Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? [ static crackles ] [ sighs , inhales deeply ] Okay . Stay calm , Allura . Think . What would Lance do ? [ exhales ] Hey there , Blue Lion . You know , you 're really activating my particle barrier right now . [ chuckles ] Nothing works ! I 've tried asking you nicely , and I 've tried commanding you . What do you want from me ? I can 't do this . Everyone depends on me . The universe depends on me , but I can 't control everything . I ... I need your help . [ growling ] [ growling continues ] [ gasps ] I can hear you . [ grunts ] [ grunting ] [ grunts ] Help me . Guide me . I can 't do it alone . [ beeping ] [ beeping continues ] [ growls ] A sonar map . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking , Blue ? Someone 's learning . Come on . Almost . Nitrate gas ! Now , let 's see if this freeze ray works in here . - [ grunting ] - [ alarm blaring ] I 've lost control of the left wing . Well played , Paladin . We did it , Blue ! Now , we need to find the other paladins . [ Hunk ] Hey , Pidge . Here 's the scenario . You 're stranded on a scary gas planet , and you only have one food to eat for the rest of your life . What 's it gonna be ? Maybe a burrito ? You like burritos , right ? Mine would be a burrito . [ Allura ] Hailing Pidge and Hunk . Are you paladins looking for an exit ? No way ! You guys found us ! [ laughs ] Actually , Allura found you . She found all of us . - She was able to connect with her lion . - [ Pidge ] Wow ! How did you do it ? I just had to get into a Lance-like mindset and stop thinking so much . Yeah , think like Lance ! Wait a minute ! Are you calling me dumb ? - No , I 'm calling you a natural . - Naturally dumb . Yeah , he was born with it . Look , I 'm glad we 're all making fun of Lance , but we still have to find a way out of here . Follow me . I know a way out . Wait a tick . Everyone , we have company . It looks like Lotor called for backup . [ Hunk ] Oh , man . It 's always something . [ Keith ] We have to form Voltron . But we were not able to form Voltron the last time we tried . We have to keep trying . We may have come here fragmented and disorganized , but the only way we 're getting out of here is if we work together . This is our team . Shiro believed in us . We have to believe in ourselves . Who 's with me ? [ all ] Yeah ! Now , form Voltron ! [ roars ] [ roars ] [ rapid beeping ] I 'm picking up an energy signature I haven 't seen before . - Hunk , I 'm a leg ! - Pretty cool , right ? [ roars ] [ Pidge ] Lotor 's getting away . Should we go after him ? [ Keith ] No . Pushing the team too hard is what got us in this mess in the first place . We 'll face him again when we 're ready . Roger that , team leader . Where are we going ? Voltron is back there ! This is our time to fight ! A leader must know when to leave the field of battle . We 'll face them on a day of our choosing . They can form Voltron , after all . Will that be a problem ? No . An opportunity .

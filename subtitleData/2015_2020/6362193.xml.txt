 Fitz : Dinner . Simmons : Fast approaching , yes , and we 'll eat it , I 'm sure . Yeah , no , no , no . But me and you - - Maybe we could eat somewhere else , Somewhere ... Nice . Oh . [ snap ] Good . Uh , well , y- - uh , you should come find me When you 're finished here , and - - and I 'll - - I 'll start working on options to run by you ... For that . [ door closes ] Ugh . What idiot - - Oh ! Aah ! Aah ! [ coughs ] [ wind whistling ] No ! Fitz ! Fitz ! Help ! Help ! No . No . [ breathing heavily ] [ cellphone beeping ] Where the hell am I ? [ grunts ] [ wind howling ] No . That 's not possible . Everything will be fine . Proper protocol for agents lost in the field - - Remain in position , wait for extraction . This is dr . Jemma simmons , updating the file On the monolith fitz and I have been studying . I now know that it is an alternating Matter-transportation device - - portal . Quite remarkable , really . I 've been transported To an unknown planet in a different solar system . [ inhales deeply ] Air is breathable , oxygenated . Gravity seems to be slightly stronger ... Or I 'm very tired . No , I think it 's the gravity . The terrain is barren , desert-like . [ camera shutter clicking ] Although conditions seem favorable For terrestrial organisms , There 's no immediate sign of life Nor any noticeable vegetation or water . It will open again . Fitz will find a way . After all , we 're going for dinner . What is it you always say ? If you can 't solve a problem , sleep on it . [ sighs ] Goodnight , fitz . [ cellphone beeps ] [ gasps , breathing heavily ] How long are the nights on this planet ? There has to be a sunrise eventually . ¶ ¶ Where is the sun ? ! What did you do to it ? ! I want the sun ! [ crying ] I want it ! [ sobs ] [ sniffles ] I want to go home . [ wind whistling ] The average person can survive up to three weeks without food , But only 100 hours without water . I 'm sorry , fitz . I can 't wait here any longer . But if you do show up while I 'm away , You 'll know where to find me . Is it going to be an expensive place ? Have you already picked it ? Should I wear a dress , or would that be weird ? Oh , please , don 't pull out the chair for me . Or do , if that 's what you want . What if we run out of things to talk about ? For the first time ever . Of course that 's when it would happen . Ugh . That would be terrible . [ gasps ] [ grunts ] [ grunting ] Just ... Get ... To the top . Water ... [ wind whistling ] [ groans ] Fitz ... Fitz . Unh ! Ah . [ sighs ] Oh . [ sighs ] [ laughing ] [ chuckles ] [ gasps ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] [ coughs ] It 's been three weeks , fitz . If I don 't find something ... If I don 't eat , I won 't make it . Unfortunately , the only source of food ... ¶ ¶ ... Also thinks I 'm food . You want me ? ! Here I am ! It 's dinnertime ! Come and get it ! Ohh ! [ gasps ] [ panting ] You 're dinner , biatch ! [ chuckles ] whoo ! [ gasps , laughing ] [ sighs ] [ chuckles ] [ laughs ] [ sighs ] [ burps , laughs ] You 'd be so proud of me , fitz . I killed the monster plant , Then I made a fire , cooked him , and ate him . And then I burped really loud . [ laughs ] I wish you could 've been here . Actually , no , I don 't . I wouldn 't wish that on anyone . [ wind whistling ] Everyone always said we could read each other 's minds , fitz . So I really need you to read mine right now . I 'm alive . [ chuckles ] But I 'm terribly alone and afraid . So I really need you to come and get me , okay ? I know you won 't give up , so I won 't , either . [ wind whistling ] [ cellphone beeps ] You 'll notice I 'm giving less updates To conserve battery power . Been on this stupid planet for a month now , And I lost my way to the entry point . I need to find - - [ tapping ] [ tapping continues ] [ wind whistling ] Oh . [ clattering ] Unh ! [ breathing heavily ] [ gasps ] Who are you ? ! What do you want ? ! ¶ ¶ You 're still here . Of course I 'm still here . ¶ ¶ Let me out of here . Let me out of here now ! [ crying ] [ grunts ] Welcome back . How was your day ? [ sighs ] My name is jemma simmons - - dr . Jemma simmons . I 'm from earth , and I came here through a portal . And since you speak english , I suspect you might have , as well . If you let me out , I can help you . We can help each other - - Aah ! You 're going to eat me ! Is that what this is all about ? ! You fatten me up and then leave me to the slaughter ! Not a bad idea . [ footsteps departing ] [ groaning ] You poisoned me . Why would you do that ? What threat could I possibly be to you ? [ groaning continues ] Definitely real . [ grunting ] Man : Get back here ! [ panting ] Aah ! [ grunts ] Aah ! [ groans ] Kill me if you want . But I 'm not going to be your prisoner . Aah ! You 're bleeding . Aah ! What do you care ? Aah ! It smells blood . Get away from me ! Don 't touch me ! [ wind howling ] It 's coming . We have to go . Aah ! We have to go now ! No ! Aah ! We have to go ! Stop pulling me ! I 'm not going with you ! Get in . Now . Come on ! [ groans ] Aah ! Move ! [ panting ] What do you think is out there ? [ panting ] Death . The only thing out there is a sandstorm . It 's a desert planet , in case you hadn 't noticed . It affects the planet . That 's how you know it 's coming . Or th-the planet affects it . Either way , it 's evil . This whole godforsaken planet is evil . Planets cannot be evil . Everything that happened was a natural , climate-related phenomenon . Planets have ecosystems with definable patterns And rules that can be understood after enough - - This planet does not have rules . It has moods . Perhaps it 's you who has moods . We need to sew that up . And maybe your mouth , too , while I 'm at it . I 'm perfectly capable of tending to my own wounds . Why would I trust you , anyway ? You locked me in a cage , stabbed me with a spear - - [ grunts ] - - threatened to eat me ... That was your idea . Besides , that 's before I knew you were real . The evil hadn 't gotten to you or to me . Next time you have doubts about whether someone is real , Ask them to hit you . I 'll keep that in mind . Do you have a name ? Will . You wouldn 't happen to have any alcohol , would you , will ? Yeah . I 'll run down to the drugstore and get it for you . Would you , please ? If it 's not too much trouble . [ sighs ] [ gasps ] Will : You 're a doctor ? Not a medical doctor , but yes . I have phds in biology and chemistry . But I have more than my fair share Of emergency work in the field . You ? Not very sciencey . Hmm . You certainly came here prepared . Wish I 'd had time to pack , But my trip was rather unexpected . You come here alone ? Yes , I 'm alone . Are you ? You 're the first person I 've seen in a long time . How long have you been here ? Well , my watch broke quickly , And it 's hard to keep track of the days without a sun . What year is it ? 2015 . You 're an astronaut . ¶ ¶ If nasa sent you , they must know how to bring you back , right ? ¶ ¶ This equipment is ancient . I know nasa has funding issues , But you 'd think they 'd upgrade for a mission like this . It was new at the time . ¶ ¶ What year did you come here ? 2001 . My god . You 've been here 14 years . Like I said ... It 's hard to keep track . You 'll see . ¶ ¶ Technology must have hit warp speed after I left . Yeah , it 's hard to keep up sometimes . If it wasn 't for fitz , I 'd be lost . Fitz ? My best friend . He loves tech . Is this a map of the area ? Only the areas we were able to explore . What 's this , the no-fly zone ? Off limits . Only bad things happen there . How much memory you have in this thing ? 120 gigabytes . Hundred and - - 120 gigabytes in this little thing . 14 years ... I 'm sorry , but I need to conserve the battery . Oh . Fitz engineered it to last a long time , but it 's draining . So unless you have some way to generate power ... Nasa sent us here with all the power we could ever use . Except it 's all solar . And in case you haven 't noticed , there 's not much sunshine . Where 's this light coming from ? There 's a luminescent substrata below us . Oh . It 's warm . It 's a natural source of heat . Keeps the planet warm without sunlight . That sounds very sciencey of you . I think it 's the fires of hell . Okay , then . Hey , you hungry ? You said your whole team came through the portal . How long were you supposed to be here ? They said they could have us back within a year . But there was always a possibility It would be a one-way trip . Nasa was always curious about the monolith . Budgets for space exploration had vanished , So some small group on the inside Convinced everyone it was the affordable future Of space exploration . If you 're not with nasa , H-how did you get into the monolith ? It 's not with nasa anymore . It 's with s.H.I.E.L.D. They 've had it for quite some time . I 'm not sure how or why . That 's real ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ? It was . I was recruited right out of the academy . I was a test pilot for the air force , recruited by nasa . Now here I am . Here we are . At least you volunteered . Yeah . I have never been able to resist Doing something when I 'm told the odds are impossible . When nasa wanted volunteers , I was first in line ... And the first one through the portal ... Me and all the gear . The other three were right behind me . They were all scientists . How did nasa know there would be an hospitable planet on the other side ? Classified above my pay grade . Our job was to collect samples , map the terrain , Study the stars . My job was to keep my head if things went sideways . Keep everyone alive till they found a way to bring us back . What happened to the others ? It . It has this way ... Of getting inside your head and just making you crazy . Austin threw himself off a cliff . Brubaker ... Set himself on fire . Taylor took an axe to the gear And then he came after me . I had one Job . Keep them alive . How did you survive ? Oh , just managed to avoid it . Occasionally outsmart it . Mostly ... Just luck . And if there is no " it " ? You still think I 'm making all this up ? It 's just that there 's also a psychological reason For what happened to them . Maybe they went mad from extreme isolation . It 's not uncommon . It is for astronauts . We 're trained for years of isolation . Well , if they didn 't go mad ... Well , then I must have gone mad . ¶ ¶ Maybe I went crazy , and maybe I killed everyone . I - - I didn 't - - You have no idea what the hell 's going on here . [ bowl clangs ] I didn 't mean to imply ... Perhaps it 's best if we start over , Since we 're going to be working together . Working together ? On what ? On getting home . There 's no getting home . The sooner you accept that , the better . Survival 's all that matters . I will not accept that . There 's always hope . Not on this planet . Then that 's how we 'll work together . I 'll be the voice of hope . You 'll be the voice of doom . We 'll keep each other in check . Deal ? See ? It 's working already . No , it 's not . Will : Ice-cold beer . Oh . Truffle fries . Steak , medium-rare , and another ice-cold beer . Mm-hmm . Wine . Oh , I 'd kill for a glass of wine . What do you miss that 's not food ? Well , the sun , without a doubt . You ? Okay , jemma , get ready to make a wish , And we will blow out the candle for you . All : Happy birthday , jemma ! Fitz : Happy birthday , jemma . It 's not the same without you here . Say hi to your parents for me , and I 'll see you soon . That 's fitz . That 's fitz . Yeah , I figured . You talk about him a lot . [ chuckles ] His name is like your favorite word . I mean , that 's ... A little bit more than a best friend . Oh . We 're inseparable . [ chuckles ] Well , we were . Anyone in your life ? I always thought there 'd be time for that later . [ sighs ] I think I 'm going to turn in for the night . Thanks for dinner . Goodnight , fitz . [ cellphone beeps ] Goodnight , will . [ wind whistling ] Damn it , fitz ! What are we missing ? If there 's a way in , there has to be a way out . Everything okay ? No , it 's not okay . I 've been going over and over this research For over two months , and I 'm still no closer to an answer . Well , why don 't we go outside , go for a little walk ? I want to go to the no-fly zone . We 've been over this a hundred times . You 're not going out there . That 's a bad place . The answer might be there . I 'm tired of sitting around and waiting ! Nothing is out there except for death ! I told you , that 's where they all went right before - - It 's a coincidence ! [ breathes deeply ] There could be something there . You are not going . We made a deal to keep each other in check . " in check " doesn 't mean you get to keep me as your prisoner . Where you going ? Obviously , nowhere . He means well , jemma . [ sighs ] You should make him dinner tonight . Yes . That seems like a good idea . Then you should stop talking to yourself . [ wind whistling ] [ chuckles ] The stars . Fitz , that 's the answer . [ laughs ] [ thunder rumbling ] [ wind howling ] [ grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] Aah ! [ panting ] Oh . Open the door ! ¶ ¶ It 's coming ! You were right , will . I saw it , whatever it is . Something was out there . Where 'd you see it ? Where were you ? Out by some junkyard . We weren 't the first ones here . It was a masquerade . Jemma , that 's near the no-fly zone . I told you never to go there . You could 've been killed or worse . You knew about that place ? All those bones , proof of others , and you didn 't tell me ? Yes . ¶ ¶ Because I knew you 'd want to see it . And it 's better that you didn 't . That thing ... Has been killing everyone that 's come through here for centuries . How long have people known about the monolith , And why keep sending people when there 's no way back ? It 's as if they 're being sacrificed . I 'd prefer not to join them . So from now on , will you just please stay put ? That doesn 't matter anymore . Why ? 'cause I know how to get us home . Simmons : This is where you came in . This is where I came in . All right , professor , I 'm listening . The monolith creates a wormhole - - A direct line from its location on earth To a fixed location here . You said the portal is moving . It appears to be moving , but it 's the planet that 's moving , Rotating on its axis . The portal is fixed . Since we know the date , time , and place we both arrived , We know how long it took to move from " x " to " y . " If we track the stars long enough , We can determine the rate of the planet 's rotation And predict when and where the portal will appear . With that thing ? Not with this . With that . Assuming we could even fix that heap of junk , There 's no way to power it . Yes , there is . I have enough battery left to get the data we need . If we use up your battery and this doesn 't work ... That 's the end of fitz and all your friends . All : Happy birthday , jemma ! Fitz : Happy birthday , jemma . It 's not the same without you here . Say hi to your parents for me , and I 'll see you soon . Goodbye , fitz . I 'll see you soon . [ cellphone beeps ] ¶ ¶ [ chuckles ] ¶ ¶ What happened ? It died , but it 's in a better place now . You get anything ? We got one - - there - - 18 days from now . [ sighs ] Did it have to be there ? That 's the no-fly zone . It 's a 40-hour hike , at least . There 's a canyon 30 meters wide waiting for us . It 's impossible to cross , jemma . We 'll never make it . Didn 't you say you can 't resist doing something When the odds are impossible ? I knew that snake would come back to bite me . Got two weeks , fly boy . Figure it out . So , question , professor - - why science ? How 'd you figure all this out ? The planets , the math ... Scoliosis . Okay . I had scoliosis as a kid . I had a small surgery to correct it . I was flat on my back for a few weeks , So to help combat the boredom , every night , My father would wheel my bed out and talk about the stars . Nice job , dad . So , this portal - - How do we know it 's not just a door that swings one way ? I think it acts more like a valve . On earth , it seemed to open randomly , But it only appeared random from our point of view . What opens it ? The moons . Their degree of alignment affects the portal The way our moon affects the tides , 'causing it to ebb and flow , pulling things in and out . So , the portal opens , we just jump right through , Go with the flow ? It doesn 't stay open very long , So in case there 's no time for that ... We send a message in a bottle - - Everything fitz needs to know to open it , Keep it open , and come and get us . I 'm glad that thing sent you over here and not the janitor . How exactly is this supposed to get us across the canyon ? We only have one shot , and we have to leave tomorrow . Well ... I 'm gonna shoot this into the wall across the canyon ... And we 're gonna slide across on the rope . What , did you think I was gonna build a helicopter ? Kind of . You think it 's gonna work ? It 'll work . You still want to do this ? We don 't have a choice . ¶ ¶ Eat , shower , or sleep ? What are you gonna do first when we get back ? Eat . Please . Who you talking to ? What 're you gonna do ? Um , I 'm gonna eat in the shower And fall asleep while doing it . That 's very efficient . I expect nothing less . The geologist who came with us had this theory That this planet used to be a paradise , garden of eden . What 'd he think happened ? It , death - - whatever that thing is - - Consumed this world . Do you think we 'll see it ? [ sighs ] I don 't know . But if we do ... [ gun cocks ] ... I 'll be ready . You have a gun ? Only one bullet left . It was gonna be my ticket out of here In case things got too bad . Come on , hurry . [ breathing heavily ] Oh . This can 't be it . We made a mistake . We went the wrong way . This is the spot , but - - you said it was 30 meters wide . There 's no way we can cross that . It was , I swear . That 's more like 100 meters . Unless there was some significant earthquake ... It doesn 't want us to leave . [ rumbling ] [ gasps ] There it is ! It 's opening ! There has to be a way to make that . We didn 't come this far to fail . Maybe we don 't have to get there . Hand me the bottle . We can fire it right into the portal . If it 's not dragging any rope , it might just make it . Hurry . We 've only got one shot . I 'm well-aware . Ready ? Now ! [ grunts ] Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on ... No . ¶ ¶ We 're never going home . ¶ ¶ Will : Maybe this is our home now . This isn 't a home . This is hell . Aah ! [ crying ] Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . [ sobbing ] You were right . [ sobs ] There 's no hope on this planet . That 's what I used to think . ¶ ¶ Then you showed up . ¶ ¶ Will : Jemma , you ready ? [ scoffs ] relax . We 're not going to miss it . I 'm the one who did the maths , remember ? Even if we do miss it , There 'll be another one in 18 years . Not funny . [ wind whistling ] Will : Pretty good spot for a sunrise , huh ? It is . Think I 'll get a tan ? Well , it 's only going to last a few minutes . We 're on one of the poles . Look what I found . Will , where did you - - Is that the wine from the graveyard ? You went back for it ? [ chuckles ] I can 't vouch for the year , But I do know it pairs well with roots and moss . [ laughs ] To the sun . [ chuckles ] It 's about time . [ cups clink ] Oh , my god . That 's horrible ! [ coughs ] that 's pure vinegar . It just needs to breathe . [ laughs ] Maybe we use it in our cooking . Add some flavor to our lives . There 's that hope again . I think my dad would 've liked you . Sometimes , you remind me ... [ flare crackling in distance ] [ gasps ] It 's fitz ! He found a way ! We 're going home ! [ laughs ] ¶ ¶ Come on ! We can make it ! ¶ ¶ [ thunder rumbles ] Jemma ! Jemma , stop ! Get back here ! Jemma , stop ! Will , come on . What are you doing ? ! Oh , no . Not now . Jemma , go . You can make it . I 'm not going without you ! [ thunder rumbles , wind howling ] [ gasps ] Will ! Will ! Will ! They came for you ! It wasn 't fitz ! It 's one of yours ! Jemma , run ! It 's not what you think it is ! It 's okay ! We 're going home ! Jemma , don 't trust it ! It 'll do anything to fool you ! ¶ ¶ Oh , god . It 's here . ¶ ¶ It 's here ! Will ! Jemma , jemma , jemma , look at me , look at me , look at me . Run , run . Go ! No ! Yes , you can make it . Go ! No ! No ! No ! Will ! Go , jemma ! Will ! Will ! [ crying ] will ! Will ! Fitz : Jemma ! Jemma , are you there ? ! Fitz ? ! Jemma ! Fitz , can you hear me ? ! Jemma ? ! Jemma ! Come on , will . Fitz ! Simmons : I don 't know what happened to him ... Jemma ! ... If he 's alive or dead . ¶ ¶ [ sighs ] But I never would have survived without him . Talk to me , fitz . Please . [ footsteps depart ] Oh , god . Please , fitz , I need you to understand . I understand everything , jemma . Well , then why won 't you talk to me ? ¶ ¶ What are you doing ? [ keyboard clacking ] [ computer beeping ] ¶ ¶ We 're gonna get him back . [ crying ] ¶ ¶ [ wind whistling ]

 Previously on " The Flash " ... Despite your feeble efforts to change the future , you can 't . Everything 's the same . The future has not changed . If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future , then that 's where I need to go . Caitlin . Somebody help ! She 's gone . - Stop . That 's not what she want ... - I don 't care . 2024 . According to the future article in the time vault , I 'm still in Central City . There 's no mention of Savitar . I 'd probably trapped him in the Speed Force by then . That 's the time I need to travel to . 2024 . If I trapped him , I must 've figured out who he was , right ? Iris ? What are you doing ? Um , sorry , I was just thinking . About what ? Same as you . The future . And my dad . What about him ? I need you to make me a promise , okay ? If things don 't go our way ... - if Savitar kills me ... - He won 't . - if he does ... - He won 't . if he does , Barry , promise me that you will be there for my dad . Don 't let him push Cecile away . Don 't let him spiral out of control . Make sure that him and Wally ... Stop , okay ? We 're not gonna talk about this . You 're not gonna die . I told you , I have a plan . Barry , I need you to promise me , okay ? I 'm serious . Promise me ... that you 're gonna make sure that my dad is okay . I promise . S.T.A.R. Labs . We , uh ... we should go . - You think ? - Yeah . Oh , probably should 've made that out of carbyne . Rookie mistake . You do not want to hurt me , Caitlin . You know , you probably should 've spent a little more time finding a cure for what ails me . I care about you , Caitlin . Show me . - Julian ! - Come on , come on ! Oh , boys ... where are you ? - What are you doing ? - Buying us some time . ♪ Swing low ♪ ♪ Sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ Shh ! Hey , dummies . My palm scan still works . I don 't want to have to do this . I know you don 't . But I do . Stop ! Aw , come to save the day ? Good , now I can get rid of you , too . Caitlin , you can fight this . I know . But I don 't want to . Anything ? I searched the whole building . She 's gone . Hey , Julian , how about next time you decide to release my friend 's inner ice demon , you do it sometime in July ? I know you 're not being serious . I was trying to save her life , Cisco . Iris was right . Even H.R. was right . - We should 've taken her to a hospital . - Brilliant idea , yes . Expose her meta-human status to the world . That would 've been great , wouldn 't it ? Hey , guess what ? She 's gonna do that anyway . Guys ! Arguing isn 't gonna help us find her . Maybe we should just take five . Yeah . Yeah , probably right . I 'm gonna do this . I 'm gonna run to the future . Wait , what ? - You want to do this now ? - Mm-hmm . Barry , Caitlin is still out there . I know , but we 're running out of time . If I can find my future self , I can find out who Savitar is ... how we defeated him . Besides , I can run to the future and be back like I never even left . All right , what do you need us to do ? Just keep everybody else away from the pipeline . Barry , last time you went to the future , it was by accident . How are you supposed to get there now ? With your help . You sure this is gonna work ? I calculated the force from the explosion that propelled me to the future last time . At your fastest speed , you can create three times that force . It 's more than enough to get me where I want to go . All right . Just run as fast as you can . I 'll try to keep up . Good luck , man . 2024 . I made it . What is it , throwback Thursday ? Haven 't seen that outfit in a while , have we , honey ? Haven 't seen him in a while , either . Guess we get to ... relive the past . Kick his ass like we used to . You 've been gone for a while , so ... let me remind you ... this is my town . Our town , baby . That 's right . Our town . My mistake . Not anymore . What was that ? Did you say something , Flash ? You 're in for a world of pain . You better run , Flash . Next time , we 're gonna put him in something he can 't get out of . I knew it was you . Cisco . Barry Allen . How did you know I was here ? I had a feeling . A feeling I have not felt in a long time . And so I hacked into the security cameras , and I saw you fighting Top and Mirror Master in your O.G. suit with the white emblem ... 2017 edition , of course . Being here ... this is no accident , is it ? I came here for some information . And then I 'm ... I 'm going back . What 's the information ? Oh . Time travel . Yeah , yeah . You say something , you might mess something up , right ? Don 't worry , my powers of deduction have improved since 2017 . 2017 ... Savitar . I need to talk to me . Do you know where he is ? So H.R. stopped the S.T.A.R. Labs museum ? H.R. went on to other things . What about Caitlin ? Once she became Killer Frost , she never stepped in this building again . So I shut down this place ? My friend , you shut everything down . S.T.A.R. Labs , Team Flash ... you didn 't want us around . - So you pushed us away . - Why ? You said it was because of what we represented . That we were a constant reminder to you of what you lost . But you weren 't the only one who lost something . Are you sure he 's here ? He never leaves this place . Well , what are you doing ? Aren 't you gonna come with me ? Man , I shouldn 't even be here . Look , just get what you need , but don 't leave without saying good-bye . All right . Why are you here ? I need your help . You 're from before she dies , aren 't you ? You can 't save her . Yes , I can . And I 'm going to . No , you can 't . Go home . Just tell me who 's in the suit . All right ? That 's all I need . You tell me that , we 'll be able to track him down . We 'll learn his weakness . We 'll stop him before he even tries . Just tell me who Savitar is . I can 't . What are you ... why ? Because I don 't know the answer . Sorry you ran all this way for nothing . You want some advice , go home . Spend as much time with Iris as you can . Because pretty soon ... you 'll never see her again . You sure you can 't stay ? I 'm not gonna get what I came for . - Look , we could really use you . - Cisco ... I mean it . Mirror Master and Top are not the only villains in the city . Barry , we don 't have a Flash here . - Not anymore , okay ? - Well , Cisco ... I can 't . I 'm sorry . Look , it 's good to see you in any time . All right ? Yeah . You too . You okay ? What 's wrong ? I don 't know . A portal won 't open . I can 't get back . I can 't get back to the past . - What 's happening , Cisco ? - I don 't know . Why can 't I open a portal ? Wasn 't I running fast enough ? Well , I 'm not sure . We don 't have the telemetry for the suit . Okay , well ... we got to figure this out . I have to get back . We 're gonna get you back home . Not to worry . Look , good news ... good news , you can always go back to the exact time in which you left , no matter how long you stay here . Yeah . Maybe it was Scudder or Dillon . They seemed a little different than the last time I fought them . I mean , look around you . Everything 's different . Except you . Maybe this means we can get the team back together . - Why haven 't you done that ? - I 've tried . Believe me , I 've tried . But you see , Caitlin 's not the only thing Killer Frost took . Aah ! No hands , no vibes . And without my powers ... without you ... What ... what about everybody else ? Julian , Wally ? Joe ? It 's been a while , gentlemen . Especially you , Flash . More than you know . Allen ? Yeah , it 's me , Julian . From the past . 2017 . 2017 . The year it all began . I 'll assume you 're here for some answers then , are you ? Something like that . Well , you brought him to the wrong place , mate . I just wanted him to understand . Julian ... can I see her ? I tried to find her something more humane , but ... this is the best I could do . Caitlin ? It 's me . Barry Allen ... - I 'm ... - From the past . I can tell . There 's no hate in your eyes ... yet . So to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit ? Come to see how things turn out for Team Flash ? I wanted to see what happened to my friend . I am not your friend , Flash . I 'm so sorry I did this to you . I should have saved you . I 'm glad that you did this to me . Caitlin wasn 't . I failed her . But I won 't when I go back . I 'm gonna find you . And I 'm gonna help you . You 're no match for the God of Speed . Oh . You didn 't tell him , did you ? Well , secrets always were our thing , weren 't they ? When I became Killer Frost , Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way . We made one hell of a team . Why would you help him ? Because he gave me the thing that you couldn 't : the cure to my illness , embracing who I really am . You know who he is . Who is he ? Tell me who he is . I 'll never tell . You are gonna be so surprised when you find out . You know , I think your protégé went toe-to-toe with Savitar . Maybe he can help you out . I need to see Wally . Hello ? Hi , um , I 'm looking for Wally West ? I recognize you from Joe 's photos . - You 're Barry , right ? - Bar ... Barry , yeah . - Uh , this is Cisco . - Hey , Beth . Hey , Cisco . I 'm Beth . Come on in . I 'll be upstairs if you need anything . And stay as long as you like . We don 't get very many visitors . Hey , buddy . I brought a friend . Wally ? Hey , it 's me . It 's Barry . Hey . Can you hear me ? What happened to him ? Iris died , and that ... sent him into this rage . And , uh , he went after Savitar by himself one night . Joe found him the next day with a shattered spine . No one knows what he saw that night , but whatever it was ... he 's been like this ever since . I 'm so sorry . Listen , Barry , you and Joe ... Where is he ? Well , he 's not here , which means there 's only one other place he can be . Hey , Joe . Why are you here , Barry ? I just wanted to see you . Just wanted to see how you were doing . Now you want to know ? After all this time , now ? Uh , Joe , um ... I 'm doing my best . What happened to us ? My daughter 's life was taken . My son 's . And then you left me , Barry . The last piece of who I was ... left . Turned his back and ran away . I wasn 't there for you ? Why start now ? I 'm gonna need you to leave , Barry . Please . You promised . You promised her that you would be there for Joe . You don 't understand . I don 't understand what ? That you abandoned him ? That you abandoned him and everybody else ? - You made a promise ! - That I couldn 't keep ! Not after everything I lost . I was just as broken as Joe was ! - I don 't care . - You will ! You will . You want answers , Barry ? How 's this ? You will go back . You will do everything that you can think of to save her . You 're even gonna create time remnants of yourself , but he 's gonna kill them all , mostly . And then on the night of May 23rd , Iris West will die in your arms . - No . - And in that moment that she takes her last breath , it 'll feel like an eternity . And it will break you . She 's the love of your life , Barry . She was the love of my life . There 'll be nothing left at all but stopping Savitar . So no , you won 't be there for Joe . You won 't be there when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost . When Savitar destroys Wally . You won 't be there for any of them . But then one day , you 'll stop him . You 'll lock him in the Speed Force forever . But at that point ... he already won . Because everything that you 've ever loved is gone . Including you . Go home , Barry . There 's nothing for you here . Cisco . Did you figure out what 's keeping me here ? I need to go home . What ? You 're leaving ? Now ? He 's ... he 's ... he 's not gonna help me , man . He 's broken . And if Caitlin 's working with Savitar , I need to get back . I need ... before she 's lost to us forever . What about everyone else ? - Don 't you want to help them ? - I can 't help them . I should 've known . No matter what I do , you 're gonna abandon the ones close to you . Cisco , it 's not like that . I just ... I can 't stay here . But you want me to . To get the team back together . It wasn 't Mirror Master or Top that did something to me . It was you , wasn 't it ? Yeah . What did you do ? You know the resonance field you create when you run ? This disrupts that . I might not be able to use my powers , but I still know something about tech . Why would you keep me here ? 'Cause I miss my friend . Cis ... If you want to go , I 'm not gonna stop you . I don 't know why I expected you to be the same Barry Allen I remember . That guy still had some fight left in him . You were right . This isn 't the future that I wanted . I can 't go back knowing I let it stay like this . You want to help me try to fix it ? I thought you 'd never ask . Well , let 's get the team back together . Even H.R. Continuing with the H.R. Romance Series , " The Streak vs. Mr. Reflecto . " " Just as the villain was about to go in for the fatal blow , " Florence felt strong hands around her waist ... " lifting her like she was a feather . " Sss . " She was whisked away , " the wind blowing through her hair , " as her mystery hero finally set Florence down " on a mountaintop . " I love that part . I was in the zone . - Uh-huh . - _ _ " She , uh ... " " Florence was , um ... " And the mountaintop . Back to the mountaintop . " I have to have you ... " Okay , you know what ? We , uh , we should threesome ... do someone ... something else . I think ... Julian , H.R. What the hell is going on ? I would like to know the very same thing . I was about to check one of the most important boxes a man can check in his life . And who ... who brought us here ? I brought you all here . Oh , it 's you again . Bar ? You ... you look ... Young ? He 's from the past , Detective . 2017 , to be precise . I knew something felt weird in the cemetery . You hadn 't visited Iris in years . Yeah , that 's what I 've heard . Cisco told me , or showed me , that you all haven 't been a team in a long time . And I know that I 'm the reason for that . Iris 's death shouldn 't have driven me away from you all . I mean ... I mean , it should 've driven me closer . This isn 't what she would want . But I 'm here now to tell you that ... no matter what happens in the past , I will not abandon you . - What 's that ? - It 's a meta-human app . Mirror Master and Top are at it again . Let 's get ' em . Us , as in Team Flash ? Guys , we have a chance to put some hope back into our lives . And I ... I really need it right now . I think you do , too . So what do you say ? You ready for Team Flash to take down the bad guys again ? Team Flash . Team Flash . On three . One , two ... Thank you . Baby , you 're a rock star . Just like to shine for my man . Yeah , I don 't know . It looks a little tacky from over here . But I am old-fashioned . We told you to stay away , Flash . Yeah , well , I try not to listen to criminals . Or stupid people . You guys hearing me all right ? Yeah , Bar , I can hear you loud and clear . Man , it 's good to be back . Well , that 's ... what the ... ? Wh ... what are you doing ? - Just ... I had a ... - What are you looking for ? I just ... I found ... oh . Now I 'm ready . Should 've done as you were told . Flash , it 's two versus one . Odds aren 't in your favor . I 'll take that bet . Give him a little ride . With pleasure . Okay , that 's new . He can 't move . They 're using their powers at the same time . - What are we gonna do ? - Can 't he phase or something ? - That doesn 't work on these guys . - Well , what will ? Give me that thing in your hands . The other thing . That makes more sense . I can rejigger this to mimic the resonance fields from Scudder 's portals , make it so Barry can manipulate the mirrors . - But what about Top ? - This will also restore whatever rarefaction effect she 's causing . Yes , that 's good . That 's brilliant . But without opening another breach , how can we possibly get it into his hands in time ? I 'll take it to him . I saw what you were doing from the time vault . You need help . Give it to me . Go . Thought it was about time I did something . Cisco made it . Now her powers won 't affect us . We can go anywhere he does . The odds seem pretty even now , huh ? Go . Go . You mind ? Be my guest . Gotcha . In a bizarre twist , and the first sighting in years , eyewitnesses claim not one but two Scarlet Speedsters were responsible for apprehending Sam Scudder and Rosalind Dillon , AKA Mirror Master and Top . I 'm sure I speak for all residents of Central City when I say this : Flash , if you 're watching , it 's good to see you again . Ladies and gentlemen , - Team Flash , back at it again . - Yeah ! Yeah . Yeah , I think this was a good first step , Cisco , but yeah , we have a ways to go . Especially me . I heard what you said . And you were right . Iris wouldn 't have wanted this . She would have wanted us to stay a family . I broke that promise to her ... to all of you . You made me realize , even though Savitar 's gone , I 've ... I 've still been letting him win . I was wrong to do that . If you 're all willing to ... try to be a family again ... I think I can , too . I don 't know which ... which one of you to hug first . Him . Well , I don 't know about you , but ... I 'm in . H.R. ? What do you say ? Yeah , I got a lot of coffee tastings and some book readings ... lot of women left to charm , but I ... I 'm in . You know what ? Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters . Maybe 10 % off . On me , let 's go . Thank you . - Thank you . - I know how hard this must be . No , you don 't . Not yet . That 's the problem . And neither of us can change what 's gonna happen . I wish I could help you , believe me , I do . But you trapped Savitar in the Speed Force . Just tell me how you did it . I had help . - Help from who ? - A physicist . Her name 's Tracy Brand . She made the Speed Force trap for me . Why wouldn 't you tell me this before ? Because she didn 't figure out the technology until four years ago . Four years after Iris died . Mm-hmm . Hang on . I don 't know where she is . And I don 't understand anything that 's on here . But that 's got all her information on it . Maybe when you go back , you can find her and ... I don 't know , she can decipher it for you . I hope so . But if not ... just make some good memories with Iris . Hold onto ' em as tight as you can . Good luck . Weird , it feels just like " Back to the Future . " Which would make me Doc Brown . You 're not gonna give me some kind of letter , are you ? No , I will not . I 'm gonna do something to fix that . You 're too good of a superhero to lose those powers . Hey . You know you 're my BFF , right ? You too , man . Whoa . Wait , did you ... Did it not work ? Do we need to try again ? No , I went . I 'm back . You 're back ? I went to the future . How far ? Eight years from now . I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was . Did you ? No . But I got a lead . Something we can use . Something that 'll help us stop him . Barry , did you learn anything about Caitlin ? She aligned herself with Savitar . Why would she do that ? I don 't know . But we need to find her , before she 's lost to us forever . All right , I 'll get to CCPD . Yeah , and we 'll , uh ... we 'll dive in here , right ? Right , team ? Team Flash . On three . Okay . Okay . Joe . I love you . I love you , too . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I just ... I just want you to know that no matter what happens , I 'm always gonna be there for you . I know that , Bar . I know . Thank you . What was that about ? I 'm just keeping that promise I made to you . I 've been waiting for you . Fear not , my child . I have come only to offer you what you desire . And what 's that ? Salvation . You want to cure me ? Turn me back into Caitlin Snow ? No . I want to make sure Caitlin ... never returns . Why should I trust you ? What do you need me to do ?

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You 've already met Aida , as a voice on the computer . I built her a body . God , Lucy , look at you . What happened ? You shouldn 't have used the Darkhold . That book can help us now . Fix us . We 're gonna find the book and stop anyone who tries to get it . Stay away from me ! She was touched by a ghost . We 're gonna have to kill her . Wake up ! There 's a group called the Watchdogs . They 're hunting Inhumans . And who knows what kind of weapon they stole from the energy lab in Pasadena . What are you ? You know someone that worked at that Momentum facility ? - My uncle . - Uncle Elias Morrow ? Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary ? He 's a good man . He did a bad thing . I 'm going to go see him . It checks all our boxes ... Hardwood floors , breakfast nook , bay window , cozy and charming . Yeah , well , " cozy " means small and " charming " means old . Where did you find this place ? An e-mail offer . Honestly , it was almost too good to be true . This is the one , Fitz . I can feel it . And it 's , uh ... it 's definitely within our price range ? Can one really put a dollar amount on the perfect home ? Yes , one can , and we did . And it 'll be well worth it , I promise . Shame you can 't be here . My one day not working , and you 're in the thick of it . Yeah , I 'm heading to Radcliffe 's . It seems you 're spending all your time there lately . Does it ? Eh , I guess so . Trying to figure out a less deadly way to cure our ghost victims . Take lots of pictures . You 've got it ... Plenty of pictures . And good luck . I 'll see you tonight . - Love you . - Yeah , I love you , too . Hello ? I 'm here about the apartment . Is anybody here ? Daisy ? Sorry . I had nowhere else to turn . Eli , you 've got a visitor . Who the hell are you ? Agent Phil Coulson . I 'm with the Strategic Homeland Intervention , Enforcement and Logistics Division . S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Still a thing ? We 're making a comeback . I 'm here about an incident that occurred at Momentum Alternative Energy Lab when you worked there . Is there anything you can tell me ? There 's not much information out there . Think tank working on undisclosed projects , and then there 's an accident . " Accident . " Are you saying it was something else ? I 'm not saying anything . I 'm sure it wasn 't easy growing up where you did , but you were 1 in 10 from your high school to graduate from college and the only one to go on and get a PhD . You worked hard to provide for your sister and her kids , so I think you 're a decent guy . Sure , some petty theft as a kid , but no history of violence . But then one bad situation turned into a manslaughter charge . I don 't expect you to open up to a suit with a badge ... Suits like you is why I 'm in here . But there 's a chance , if you help me , that I can help you get out of here . Let me get that for you , Agent May . Apologies . That must have been annoying . Incredibly . Oh , speaking of which ... You seem to be feeling better , Agent May . No doubt in part to the care Aida has given to you . Aida 's my assistant . She 's been tending to you since ... since the procedure . Procedure ? Dr. Radcliffe stopped your heart for seven minutes in order to reboot your central nervous system . You did what ? Well , in order to quell the hyperactivity in your reticular activating system , we had to ... very carefully , gently ... kill you . Just a little bit . I died . Yes , and came back . Killed by Radcliffe . All in a good cause . And hopefully , we 've learned a great deal that will help us cure others who have been similarly affected . By killing them ? No , no . Well , hopefully not . Agent Fitz and I are working on a chemical solve for this ... ghost virus . But to do so , we need to run a few more tests . You 're saying I can 't leave . Soon . We 're close . But Aida will be on hand to help with further testing and to take care of your needs . Mm . You can trust me with your life , Agent May . Whoever took this bullet out did an awful job . I don 't get an " A " for effort ? You haven 't been to a proper doctor ? You 're hard to get an appointment with . I knew this place was too good to be true . You 've been tracking my search history . Yeah , well , you were always a sucker for a breakfast nook . But don 't worry ... The place is yours . And it 's rent-controlled now , so ... You really should not have ... Yeah , yeah . You also searched for double-vanity sinks . - Things with Fitz must be going well . - Yeah . Though moving in together will put it to the test , I 'm sure . It 'll be great . I 'm really happy for you . Are you now ? Oh , self-medicating . Those bone-restoration pills you 've been stealing don 't relieve pain . Are you using your arm gauntlets ? They don 't work perfectly , but we specifically designed them so that they ... They 're not exactly incognito . Stop mothering me , please . There . Now you can get back to Lone Rangering - or whatever it is you 've been doing . - Not yet . I didn 't come to you just for the Band-Aids . I thought I 'd kill two birds with one stone . Am I the bird or the stone ? These are ... Inhuman asset numbers and GPS coordinates . Why do you have these ? Snagged them from a group of Watchdogs on my way here . Got a bullet for my trouble . They 're hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. servers . That 's how they find their victims . Impossible . S.H.I.E.L.D. servers are more secure now than they 've ever been . They 're held offline in protected government facilities to ... Keep out people like me ? Yeah , well , they 're getting in somehow . And ... I need you to do the same for me . You want me to help you hack my own organization ? Simmons , they 're targeting Inhumans . They are murdering us . There are protocols , Daisy . I take mandatory lie-detection tests . I can 't just voluntarily aid a wanted vigilante . What if it wasn 't voluntary ? I 've missed you , too . It 's hard to lose people you care about . Believe me , I know . Somewhere along the way , something went wrong , and colleagues of yours , friends of yours , died . I 'd like to keep the past where it is . Well , unfortunately , your past has come back to haunt you . Because your colleagues ... Turns out they didn 't die that day . What the hell are you talking about ? They 're alive , and they 've gained abilities ... Abilities they 're using to hurt people . That doesn 't make any sense . Well , that 's usually when I enter the picture . I 'm hoping you can help me understand . Look , this is , uh ... I don 't want to get involved . I have to move on with my life . Any detail , even if it seems small , could lead us to something . I can 't talk to the only other person related to this case because you put them in a coma . You 're all I 've got . Just point me in a direction . There 's a direction for you . Stonewalled ? Is it all over my face ? It was a first attempt . I didn 't think he 'd be the trusting type . Besides , it 's not easy to find out your colleagues are back from the dead . Yeah , I can imagine . No way . What ? It 's him , the matchstick guy . - From Momentum Lab ? - Yeah , get in the car . I 'm driving . Oh , hell no . What do you weigh , 210 , 220 ? It 's not the extra weight . It 's your driving . You should 've let me take the wheel ! My car . I drive . You wouldn 't fit behind the wheel anyway . - Duck ! - No , no , no , no , no ! Oh , you 're gonna have to do better than that . Can 't be a standard Magnum under the hood . That 's got to be at least a 426 Hemi . Maybe admire his car after we catch him . What do you think ? Yeah , we 'll never catch him . I told you , you should 've let me fix the flight functionality in this thing . Don 't worry . It 's not gonna be a problem this time . I get his car now , right ? Isn 't that how this works ? Okay . Let 's go over it one more time . Is that necessary ? Yes , because we cannot afford to slip up . Okay . So , in that high-security building is one of the Inhuman registration information servers . I 'm aware of how my own agency operates , thank you . Every day at the same time , Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive with updated information to this location . I 'm to steal her I.D. badge ... So I can clone it and put a fake identity on top of it . And then you 're gonna take this flash drive ... Insert it into the server ... And it 'll give me remote access . Oh , there she is . Right on time . Okay , so we 'll need to ... Simmons . Simmons ! What the hell is she doing ? Nailed it . What do you mean you nailed it ? What did you even do ? I simply told Agent Albee that there was new information on the flash drive and she 's going to deliver it with the rest . That should give us access . And how did you get her to agree to that ? Well , technically , as S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s Special Advisor in Science and Technology , she works for me . I 'm the boss . There must be a way to synthesize the necessary neurotransmitters to regulate thalamocortical activity . Or block reception altogether . You know , a way to trick the brain out of fear and the resultant physical strain on the body . What I wouldn 't have given for that in primary school . I used to get so nervous , my eyes would all bug out , and I 'd lose my breath . Aida , sh-she 's out . Why ... Why ... Why would she be out ? Oh , you 're right . Your eyes do bug out when you get nervous . Why are you not nervous ? Because I let her out . Are you mad ? No , I 'm just a scientist . This is ... This is a huge risk . You can 't ... You can 't just parade her about . No one 's supposed to know about her . I know it 's a risk , but it 's a risk we have to take . You have improved her social cues dramatically . We are on the cusp . This is the ultimate Turing Test . I mean , who better to put Aida through her paces than the most discerning , formidable agent that S.H.I.E.L.D. has to offer ? Fitz , art and science have their meeting in method . Oh , do ... do not go quoting bloody Bulwer-Lytton at me . Fitz . Hello , Fitz . Always nice to see you . Hello . Um , how ... what is ... What is ... how is everything going in here ? Still waiting for them to finish the test so I can get the hell out of here . Just assessing any last glitches before we send May on her way . Good . We 'll leave the women to it , shall we ? Every Inhuman has a wristwatch , an Asset Communication Device that tracks location , vital signs , et cetera . I mean , it 's for their own safety . Yeah , how 's that working out so far ? Well , I ... Elizabeth Albee came through . Looks like an encrypted third party 's hijacking the stream of information ... As the devices send and receive signals . So much for new security measures . If they can tap into the data directly , then they have ... Information on a lot of Inhumans . I warned everyone on this list , but ... Let 's just see how many compromised names you weren 't able to ... Wait . I recognize that number . Who is it ? James . I haven 't seen him since ... Hive . Right . Well , withdrawal from Hive 's sway - hit him even harder than you . - I can imagine . We did everything we could for him , but like yourself , it seemed he couldn 't get away from us fast enough . Only shows his face at mandatory check-ins . Thank you for your help . It was good to see you . Where are you going ? James is next on their to-do list . I have to get to him before they do . We have to get to him . In case you don 't remember , that 's my job . I appreciate the help , Simmons , but I can take it from here ... On my own . You can 't have it both ways , Daisy . You can 't push us away and then come crawling back , half-dead , only when you feel like it . It isn 't fair . You 've already put a gun to my head . We 're in this together now . So suck it up . Damn . Not even a dent . I wouldn 't mind having a superpower like that for a day or two . Hands off my ride , man . The car is safe . Your situation 's a little more precarious . You really think this thing can hold me ? It 's contained a lot more dangerous people than you . Is that a dare ? I 've heard rumors from your part of the world about a man with a flaming skull . Always seemed like an urban legend to me . You 've managed to escape capture all this time . And we nab you in a parking lot . That 's got to hurt . We got facts , too . Robbie Reyes ... Dropped out of Garfield High . Took work at Canelo Auto and Body to help pay the rent . A halfway decent driver . With a few bad habits . Well , one really bad habit of killing people . Only those who have it coming . From what I can tell , that seems to be true . Which makes you a little more interesting . Well , I have a code I try to live by . And a penchant for spontaneous combustion , which , I must say , sounds painful . How do you do it ? You 're not an Inhuman , are you ? Why do you guys keep asking me that ? Then where does your power come from ? I made a deal with the devil . Right . Okay . Just ... Okay . Ghosts , devils ... You believe any of this stuff we 're dealing with ? I believe in God , so I got to believe in the other thing . Well , in my experience , gods usually turn out to be aliens . Alien would definitely explain the things he can do . He was at the Momentum Lab and showed up at the prison , too . We 're chasing the same things . You said Daisy trusts him ? Maybe . Huh . Wh-Why ? Why ? What are you thinking ? Coulson . What the hell are you doing ? I think it 's time I make a deal with the devil myself . This is where James works ? Afraid so . Well , whoever 's running the Terrible Ideas Division is crushing it . Now , stop me if you 've heard this before . 500 gram repeater , 10 shots of gold chrysanthemum . I 've seen it take a man 's arm clear off . So if you boys have got a death wish ... Mm ? ... this bomb 's for you . We 'll take five . Excellent choice . Hello , James . Uh , go see Sean . Uh , he 'll take care of you . Agent Simmons . How are you ? Surprised to see S.H.I.E.L.D. at my doorstep and with the infamous vigilante in tow . Quake now , isn 't it ? I didn 't come up with it . But it 's growing on me . Burning the candle at both ends . Speaking of burning , fireworks ? Really ? With your powers ? Sean over there ... Longtime smoker , 30 years . He gave up last summer . He keeps a single cigarette on his desk as a constant reminder of what he doesn 't want to be . It 's kind of like that . We 're just glad to see you 're safe . Why wouldn 't I be ? The recent Watchdog attacks . They 're finding their targets by hacking into Asset Comms Devices . They can track your location . So you think they 're after me . It 's only a matter of time . Take it off . I wasn 't really a willing participant in this little security measure . Mine doesn 't come off . Daisy . - We have to get you out of here . - Mnh-mnh-mnh . I 'm just trying to live a quiet , normal life . You don 't understand . That can 't happen anymore . The Watchdogs won 't let you . They are coming to take that life . What 's it worth , anyway , hmm ? I go from my rubbish job to my rubbish apartment . I got no family ... no reason to ... You know what that feels like , don 't you ? S.H.I.E.L.D. is here to help you move on , James . You can take a stand with me . Fight back . That 's how you move on . Take control of your life again . I 've got some stuff to finish up , but , um ... meet me after closing at the public-storage place next door . Pod 212 , second floor . I got something that might help . Damn , you two must be straight loco letting me out of my cage like that . Yeah , I was just thinking the same thing . I light up , I can bring this whole plane crashing down . With you in it ? I don 't think you 'll do that . Flying isn 't one of your special talents . I 'm opening a door for you , Mr. Reyes , both literally and figuratively . And in return you want ... ? Same thing you do ... Answers . And your Uncle Eli has them . That 's why you were going to see him . See , I think we 're on the same side , but I need you to prove it to me . Prove you 're not the demon the stories say you are . You saved a friend of mine from a guy my bullets went straight through . You 're the only one we know that can hurt those things . So let 's help each other . Eli won 't talk to us , but he 'll talk to you . All we ask is that you let us listen in on the conversation . And if I say no ? Well ... then we open another door for you , but we won 't land first . So , you see , to cease the hormonal cascade produced by the adrenal medulla and prevent further physical degradation ... You shut off my brain . - Exactly . - Mm . I 'm glad you understand . Oh , that 's the only thing I understand . The point is , even though you may be feeling better , you suffered some very real , very severe brain trauma . That said , we 're gonna have to keep you just a wee bit longer for further testing . Just to track your improvements before we release you . Excuse me ? Agent May says you can shove all your tests up your ass . Well , that 's not very nice . You speak Chinese ? Where are you from ? Well , most of me is Chinese . Canadian . She 's a Ca ... She 's Canadian , Ontario . Yeah , yeah , big Chinese population there . She did move around a lot as a kid , 'cause she 's an army brat . Oh . Um , Aida , if you could go and ready the framework for one last scan , please ? Of course . You 've been hiding Aida from me . It 's too bad . I like her . No nonsense , just business . Very impressive . Yeah . Yeah , they don 't make them like Aida , do they ? Mm . How 's my baby doing ? You mean our baby . Had to replace the fan belt . She 's been overheating a bit lately . Nothing to worry about . Your brother 's good ? He 's good . Es bueno verte , Roberto . Hola , tío . It 's not Christmas , it 's not my birthday . Can 't I just come visit my uncle when I want to ? Yeah , I got S.H.I.E.L.D. and you visiting me on the same day ? Come on , Robbie . They just want to help . They just want answers . Answers for what ? They say that this woman that you used to work with is out there killing people . Is that what they 're saying ? Tío , I 'm ... I 'm just trying to understand , man . I only know what you told me ... That you put a beatdown on your boss , that he deserved it . Why ? Who is she ? Dr. Lucy Bauer . Joseph 's wife . You put him into a coma . What were they getting into up there ? Madness . They were the project leaders of this privately funded think tank . - Momentum Labs . - Yeah . Next-level RD . They needed an engineer to help them build their design . They said they were very impressed with me . But what they really wanted was someone who wouldn 't ask too many questions . And what were you building ? A Quantum Particle Generator . It 's a machine that can create matter out of practically nothing at all . That sounds ... impossible . Yeah , it 's insane . Defies all the laws of physics . See , they thought they were pushing boundaries , and I thought they were playing God . And it blew up in their faces . Yeah , literally . They should 've listened to me . The police said it was an accident , but Joe made them move forward , and it killed them , killed the whole team ... his wife . Joe killed them . I was so pissed at what he 'd done , that ... That I couldn 't stop him . But I just ... I just ... I snapped . And I 'm doing the time . You see , Robbie , what I wanted was ... Revenge . Why didn 't you tell me any of this before ? 'Cause you were just a kid . And I was ... I was supposed to take care of you , and I let you down . But these are my demons . They 're not yours . Robbie , Lucy Bauer isn 't dead . This accident must be how she got her powers . Find out where she 'd go . What is she after ? What is she after ? She 's gonna go after the book . Book ? What book ? I don 't know what it 's called . They say it gave them the knowledge to build their machine . It has all the knowledge that anyone could ever need . Coulson . They were obsessed with it . This book is evil , Robbie . I don 't want you involved with any of this . Coulson . We got to move . We got a situation with an asset . A volatile one . Joseph . Wake up , Joseph . I need you . Wake up , please . Wake up . There you are . Now , tell me ... Where 's the book ? What 's going on ? Took a while to catch up with you guys . Had to get a head start . We going after that book ? Not yet . Something came up . Yo , listen , I held up my end of the deal , all right ? Either we go and get after it , or I take my car , and I do it myself . That 's not how things work here . We need to make a detour . We could use your help if you 're still interested in our arrangement . That depends on you . May I ask you a question ? Of course . Ask me anything . Why did Fitz lie to Agent May about where I 'm from ? You 're still in the testing phase , Aida . The point of you is to pass for human . You must always act accordingly . But you programmed me not to lie . It 's one of my tenets , along with not harming humans and being able to ... Well , lies themselves are not always inherently bad . Their intent can vary . Sometimes it 's okay to lie to shield people from certain truths , to spare their feelings or to save a life . Whose life was Fitz saving when he lied ? Why , yours . So , you 're dragging James into your vigilante quest . Is he your sidekick now ? Quake and the Amazing Bomb Boy ? How about you go wait in the van ? We 're supposed to be helping him . I am helping him . You 've chosen to walk your brooding path . Fine . Don 't drag him down with you . I never tire of hearing two women fight over me . What do you have for me ? We should be on the move . Oh . Well , that 's a nice how-do-you-do . You 're gonna like this . We keep a lot of our raw materials here in storage . Figure some explosives might come in handy . It 's a start . I could use a different type of firepower right now . I 've got you covered . Remember , I was lighting fuses long before I was the fuse . Maybe doing some good will make you feel better . I think it might . Yeah . This is your plan ? Explosives ? What is wrong with you ? This is not the solution to anything . The Watchdogs are killing people . Violence , retaliation ... That is all they understand . If I have to speak their language , then so be it . Hey . Just take it easy on her . She doesn 't understand what it 's like ... To change , to lose everything . I know . That 's the point . Fight back , right ? Only thing is the Watchdogs aren 't my enemy . You gave them access to your watch , let them hijack the signal . You son of a bitch . How could you do this to us ? How could you do this to me ? You 're the one that turned me into this freak of nature . You were obsessed with going through Terrigenesis . I gave you what you wanted . I didn 't ask for this . Hive ? And bloody misery . If I could take it all back , I would . S.H.I.E.L.D. is putting everything into helping Inhumans . Inhumans are a scourge . The Watchdogs have the right idea , so I struck a deal with them . Help them hunt and kill every Inhuman . - Aah ! - Hey ! Hunted like the animals that we are . And I 'm gonna be the last one to go . You really hate yourself that much ? I don 't hate myself . I hate all of us . I told you to wait in the van . Aah ! Catch them ! This is gonna be fun . - Where the hell are they ? ! - Find them ! Spread out ! Go , go , go ! Are you all right ? I 've been better . Thanks for the assist . Likewise . Though another move like that and you 're likely to break every bone in your arms . Yeah , I might 've done that already . How many shots do you have left ? Not enough . It 's a perfect night for a little mayhem . Wouldn 't you say , Quake ? We have to get out of here . You know , killing you may not bring me peace but it sure as hell will feel good . I 'm on fire . Well , a little more than usual . Aah ! Huh . I don 't know who the hell you think you are , but you just made a big mistake . Funny . I was gonna say the same thing ... without the accent . Robbie ? Take the stairs , find Agent Coulson . - Coulson ? - Go . It 's time to pay for your sins . Let 's head back up , check it out . Not smart to fire a gun in here . That makes six . No telling how many more are around . They 're like cockroaches , these guys . Oh , Coulson . - Simmons . - Just in time . What the hell are you doing here ? We came to find James . We thought he may be targeted by the Watchdogs , but ... " We " ? That 's exactly why we 're here . His GPS signal went out , so we came to his last recorded location and found it overrun with these guys . They 've got to be here somewhere ! James turned on us . He 's working with the Watchdogs . Then it 's a good thing we brought Robbie Reyes . Fight fire with fire . That 's a saying , isn 't it ? I won 't let you take me yet ! I will be the last one to die . Did two fire dudes just drop into a warehouse full of fireworks ? You had to see that coming . Let 's go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! You said alive , right ? Thank you for saving Simmons and I back there . You 're welcome . Are you gonna ... say anything else ? Nothing else to say . I 'm just glad you 're safe . - The Watchdogs are ... - The Watchdogs took a hit . They continue to be a threat , but we have to put them on the back burner for now . They 're not gonna stop just because we ... We have a more pressing threat on our hands . Sorry , but for me , nothing is more pressing than ... Look , I know you two like to work alone , settling the scores that are personal to you , but that 's not how we work here at S.H.I.E.L.D. We work together ... To keep everyone safe . From things like this . Is that the book my uncle was talking about ? I think so . Well , you know where to find it ? No one ever has . Not Daniel Whitehall , not the Red Skull , not even Nick Fury himself . He 's an old friend , sort of a mentor , really . But they all went looking for it . It 's called the Darkhold . It 's been referred to as a book of sins , a book of spells ... infinite knowledge . I don 't know what it is , but I do know that it 's in all of our best interests to keep it out of the wrong hands . That shipment you were tracking in Los Angeles . Yeah , I thought it was a weapon . In the form of a person . Lucy Bauer . Who your uncle said was playing God . Now she 's after it . So you may want to be solo , but forces beyond our control are driving us together . You don 't need us ? Fine . Right now , we need you . Do you have any idea where to start ? Joseph Bauer , the man Robbie 's uncle said was at the center of all this , he 's been in a coma all these years . Well , he just woke up . I would like to thank you again , Agent May , for all your help . Yeah , we know the tests were obnoxious enough to make you want to hit someone . Just glad that person wasn 't me . Need a lift ? Desperately . It 's good to see you back in fighting form . - Dying takes a lot out of you . - I 've heard . We should start a club , get some T-shirts made up . We got a problem . I need you with me on this . You know I 'm in . Thank you for your help . It was my pleasure , Agent May . I don 't think we 've met . Phil Coulson . Agent Coulson . I 'm Aida . My assistant . Oh . How long have you been lending a hand to our friend Dr. Radcliffe ? Since he gave me hands . Oh . Wow . Impeccable work . I 'm a fellow amputee . What happened , if you don 't mind me asking ? Not at all . I 've actually been this way since birth . Thank God for Dr. Radcliffe and Dr. Fitz 's work . Couldn 't agree more . Hey . Now I see why you 've been spending so much time here . What ? Aida ... She 's beautiful . Is she ? Ah , yeah , she is all right , I guess . I prefer a classical beauty myself . She 's so real . Her ... Her conversational responses , her range of motion ... Those are weird things to say about a person . Fitz , she 's an android . You do know she 's an android , right ? Yeah , of course I know that she 's an android , 'cause I helped out . Why do you think her dynamic reaction force is so low ? - Why didn 't you tell me ? - Well , I wanted to . Obviously , you can 't tell the new Director , and what with your lie-detector tests becoming more frequent , who knows the next time they 're gonna call you in and then a ... Tomorrow . It 's tomorrow . Well , that 's not good . This is one lie you 're gonna have to tell . Actually , I 'll have a few .

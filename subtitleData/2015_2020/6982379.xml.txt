 Synced by DAMAN [ theme music plays ] [ Angelica ] Will ... Will ... [ man ] The chairman obviously regrets not being able to attend , but he had an urgent matter in Beijing . [ man 2 ] Please thank your boss for his cheap champagne and even cheaper excuses . [ man ] Our budget is ten percent of what you spent on a military drone program . [ man 2 ] We have the authority to de-fund this experiment . [ man ] What we 're promising is accuracy , immunity . [ man 2 ] You 've been promising it for years . What 's happening ? Bad things . Will ... it 's all my fault . But if the neural graft works , what will they do with it ? They are afraid of us . I believe this will help them be less afraid . You trust me , don 't you ? Please , Will ... you have to stop it . No . Stop . [ screaming ] Enough ! I 've seen enough ! [ gasping ] Will ! Will ! It 's okay . You 're okay . - [ gasping ] - It 's okay . I 've got you . You 're safe . ... and you should probably be talking to . Thank you for taking the time to help us . No problem . Happy to talk with folks who don 't keep asking me - if this is going to be on the test . - [ chuckles ] Grace said you were writing a thesis on early hominoids ? We 're interested in the branch-off point between Homo sapiens and other early ancestors , like the Neanderthal and Homo sensorium . Sensorium ? Now that 's a term I don 't hear often . Sounds like you don 't believe they existed . Well , there 's certainly not enough data in my field to support the theory , but I 'm a bits and bones gal . If you ask someone like Professor Kolovi , a geneticist at University of Chicago , he 's likely to have a different opinion . I 've read his book . My condolences for that lost time . You don 't agree with him ? One of the reasons I find anthropology so fascinating is that the facts themselves are evolving . Yesterday we damned or dismissed Darwin . Today we deride men like Kolovi , calling their work science fiction . But tomorrow , his work might seem visionary . Freud believed our ancestors used telepathy to communicate . No one knows whether early humans used another kind of language or not . It is a tickle to imagine , if Kolovi 's theories are accurate , a Homo sensorium could walk into my office , - I might never even know it . - [ laughter ] - I think ... - What ? I am just considering another perspective ... Baby , you have to go . Dani ! - Tell him he has to go ! - Hey ! - That one . - This one ? - Tell him he has to go , please . - Wait , what ? - You 're not coming ? - See ? With everything that 's going on , I don 't know think that this is the right thing to do . - It 's so the right thing . - Every premiere you stayed home . Not this time . You 're coming . - I ... - Baby , you said it a hundred times . This is what you always wanted . Isn 't it ? - It is . - [ Dani squeals ] Then get dressed ! I want us all looking sensational ! Why do I have this little voice inside my head saying ... " Be careful what you wish for " ? - Yes ! - [ men grunting on screen ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ man ] Lito ! Hello . How are you ? Nice to see you guys . - Okay . - Gracias . I am reporting for Kobi Kihara . - Hello . I 'm Jela . - Hello . Where can we find the man they call Van Damn ? The man they ... You sure not Jela ? Van Damn . Okay , so I will , uh , call ... Van Damn . Just ... - Capheus ! Someone 's looking for you . - Who is it ? I don 't know her name . I don 't know who she is . Lito Rodriguez . Long time no see . Mariana , thank you for coming . What have you been up to ? Well , I ... I am very excited about the premiere of this film . It 's one of my favorites . Would you care to comment on the scandalous photos of you that recently went viral on the Internet ? Wow , Mariana , no friendly chit-chat , just right for the jugular . Yeah . - So you 're the famous Van Damn ? - I am . My name is Capheus . And what is your name ? - And this is your matatu ? - Oh , yes . Yeah . Move . You 're blocking the bus . Are you denying the photos are real ? No , no , no . I did not say that . So are you a homosexual ? It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . Can you explain to me why it matters ? It matters to your fans . If you are lying to them , they have the right to know . Tell our viewers why it is that you 're called Van Damn . Have you ever seen Lionheart ? No . I don 't watch movies like that . - [ chuckles ] Movies like what ? - Movies that glorify violence . Movies where the white man saves the world . Lionheart is not about any of those things . - It 's about courage . [ laughs ] - Courage . Uh ... I am very grateful to my fans . I know that , as an actor , all I tried to give them is something true , is something from my heart . Then you were lying to them before ? Lito , come on . Let 's go . Is this your lover then ? Sorry , I didn 't recognize him with his clothes on . Do you ... - Do you know what your problem is ? - I don 't have a problem . I just want to understand ... You 're not trying to understand anything . Are you admitting you 're gay or not ? No , you 're not trying to understand anything . Because labels are the opposite of understanding . But Van Damme is white . Yes . So even if it 's about courage , it 's about white courage . I 'm sorry . Maybe I 'm not understanding , but what does courage have to do with the color of a man 's skin ? - I was just a little kid ... - ... who loved ... - ... movies . And the ... - ... heroes I watched ... - ... made me feel like I was ... - ... braver than I was . - Funnier . - Smarter . They made me feel that I could do things that I ... - ... made me believe I could do things ... - ... I didn 't think think I could do . But that boy who watched TV with his mama mama , and grandma , and aunties and aunties , is not the man who became an actor . ... not the man who became a driver . That driver is not the same person you see standing here . - And who is stand ... - ... ing here ? Who am I ? Who am I ? - Do you mean ... - ... where I 'm from ? - Where I 'm from ? - Do you mean where I 'm from ? - What I one day might become ? - Where I 'm from ? - What I do ? What I 've done ? - What I do ? - What I dream ? - What I dream ? What I do ? What I 've done ? - What I do ? - What I 've done ? Do you mean ... what you see ? - What I 've seen ? - What you see or ... what I 've seen ? - What you see or what I 've seen ? - What I fear or what I dream ? - Do you mean ... - ... what I do ? What I 've done ? - What I fear ? - What I fear ? - What I dream ? - What I dream ? - What I one day might become ? - Do you mean who I love ? Who I love ? - Do you mean who I love ? - Who I love ? - Do you mean who I love ? - Who I love ? - What I 've lost ? - Do you mean what I 've lost ? Do you mean what I 've lost ? Who am I ? - Who am I ? - Who am I ? - Who am I ? - Who am I ? - I guess who I am is ... - ... exactly the same as who you are . - Not better than . - Not less than . Because there is no one who has been or will ever be exactly the same as either you or me . [ laughing ] [ laughter ] - Did you get that ? - That was good . Have a great night . Zakia . Uh ... what ? My name is Zakia . Pleased to meet you . [ dramatic music plays in movie ] [ whispers ] Hernando . Yeah . Big moment coming up . [ man in movie ] It 's El Caido . You said he would come for you . A man must never be judged by the length of his gun or the size of his fortune . In the end , we 'll all be judged by the courage of our hearts . [ audience murmuring , laughing ] Uh-oh . Hello . Hello again . Hi . Look , I feel like I owe you an apology . Oh , no . Not at all . I do , because I haven 't been able to stop thinking about what you said and how it applied to my own life . You spoke so beautifully and from your heart to someone who didn 't come to listen . Words aren 't usually my strong suit . [ chuckles ] Would you like to grab a bite ? Hell , yes , he would . [ electronic dance music plays ] And this is the living room floor . - This is the living room ? - Yeah . [ laughter ] Then upstairs is actually ... [ music continues ] This is so cool . A swimming pool ? - Oh , my God ! - Wow ! - Oh , no , you do it . - Yeah . - Come , come . Turn . - Selfie . Selfie . [ shutter clicking ] - Compliments of the house . - Okay . Thanks . I 'm afraid I might be growing accustomed to a certain lifestyle . You might have to keep murdering gangsters for me . There are worse professions . Right on cue . Enjoying yourselves ? I 'm Sebastian Fuchs . The King of the North . - May I have a seat ? - It 's your club . I want you to feel welcome and respected here . Yeah , sure . To be honest with you , Felix , I don 't like many people . Most people suck . They pretend , lie . They do anything to manipulate and control the situation around them . In a world such as this , the most precious thing a man can find is loyalty . Yeah . I know how loyal you are to your friend and how loyal he is to you . I admire that kind of loyalty . What do you think about this club , Felix ? What do I think of it ? Are you kidding me ? It fucking rocks . I want to live here . Yeah . - Good . It 's yours . - What ? I 'll have my lawyers prepare the paperwork in the morning . You can sign them at my place . I 'll see you there . A pleasure . What did he say ? He just ... gave me the club . [ dog barking in distance ] [ Zakia ] I think I used to be able to think the way that you do . At university , I believed in progress , that what you did mattered , that things were getting better . But now , I don 't know , I think I 've seen too much of the world . But you are a woman , working as a journalist . That wouldn 't have been possible for our grandmothers . Yeah , I know . And I used to believe that those kind of details were important . I think about my grandmother 's life and I cannot call your life a " detail . " - It is her dream coming true . - It seems so small ... compared to the scale of what was wrong back then and what is still wrong . Hm . I 've seen such ... barbaric things ... such cruelty , injustice , and then complete indifference to it all . How can it matter what job it is that I do ? Many terrible things happen every day . They have happened to me , to my family . It 's why courage is so important . It takes courage to see such terrible things happen and still get up every day ... and be able to see what is still beautiful . It takes courage to remember that this is a world where our dreams , like our grandmothers ' , do come true . Will , can you hear me ? I heard horses . Neville 's grown up . Neville ? He 's beautiful . [ hooves thundering ] [ Riley ] Can you tell me what you see ? [ Will ] There 's a lot of land . Big house . The horse seems to know what he wants , like he can read his thoughts . It 's like they share one mind . Wouldn 't that make it easier ? Of course , then you 'd know all the wicked things I was hoping to do to you before I lose you to Chicago . I like it better when you surprise me . [ both chuckle softly ] Take your pills , dear . Yes , dear . What about a name ? I was so close this time . I just saw his wife . Did you hear a name ? Chicago . Nomi has to go to Chicago . Okay , but now you need to eat . - Will ? - I 'm too tired . You can 't just keep all these secrets , Kala . At some point you have to tell me about the honeymoon . Kala ... I can 't get him to eat . Have you tried the orexigenic ? Is he not eating ? I knew it . He 's lost weight . Are you sure he 's happy ? He 's fine , okay ? We 're fine . I just ... Excuse me . [ Kala ] Let me check . His reactions are getting very slow . Sleep cycle 's shorter . All he does is sleep . Drug-induced unconsciousness is not the same as sleep . I 'll increase his vitamins and small amounts of naloxone . But the fact is that we cannot keep this up for much longer . He 's hoping to get more information on Whispers or BPO . Nomi hasn 't been able to find out more ? Nomi has one of the best code-breaking minds in the world looking for any crack in this company . But every time we find one , they seem to burn the house down . - [ beeping ] - Shit ! Shit ! Did they tag you ? These people are good . And impressively , they might be even more paranoid than I am . What about the records from the facility in Iceland ? Neets linked some obvious aliases to visas for charter travel , but we still can 't tell who 's actually running or paying for that company . Um , sorry , was that to me ? I warned you she talks to herself a lot these days . We can keep digging , but really what we need is something more specific : a direction , a name , a bank account . Will has to get us something more concrete . You fight so hard for us , but this is not a fight for you alone . His Chi 's very weak . [ Lito ] It 's been months . How long does he think we can keep hiding ? I don 't know . Don 't give up on him . He wouldn 't give up on any of us . We are all family now and I want to discuss our future . There 's nothing quite like an attempt on one 's life to make one examine one 's priorities . Last Sunday , I had a meeting at the prime minister 's office . And he told me that as a modernizer and a businessman , I am an electoral asset . And this afternoon , for the sake of India and its future , I 've told the prime minister that I most humbly accept his offer . [ coughing ] Dad , I thought you said you would not make a decision without consulting us . I didn 't build this giant pharmaceutical empire by dillydallying . And how do you feel about this , Mum ? [ father ] Your mother has always supported all my decisions . Support is the open secret of any successful marriage . Mum ? It is as your father says it is , Rajan . This is a momentous occasion indeed . May I offer my congratulations to you , Manendra ? Thank you . As well as my deep heartfelt wish for this new family 's happiness . Cheers ! - Cheers . - Cheers . Wittgenstein wrote that " the limits of my language are the limits of my world . " We tend to think so highly of language because we think so highly of ourselves . Yet imagine being able to communicate thought and feeling without words . Words . Their inadequacy is a cliché . " Words can 't express . " " Words aren 't enough . " " I can 't find the words . " But what if you didn 't have to ? Hmm . Now , there is no way to prove whether our early ancestors used language as we know it or not . Yet , if language supplanted this older communication , the obvious conclusion is that language must be superior , sequitur quod , so are we . More to the point , what evolutionary advantage would our form of communication have over theirs ? What couldn 't you do if people could read your thoughts ? For starters , you couldn 't lie . There was a time we thought our place in the world was the will of the Divine . As that rationale fell out of favor , it was the science of the Enlightenment that provided any number of answers to our ascendancy . It is only recently , in light of the havoc and devastation our existence has inflicted on this planet have we begun to question the nature of our supremacy . When we consider our ancestral relatives , we have typically blamed their extinction on their own bad luck . Mounting evidence however suggests that it was not an accident nor a failure of adaptation . Our cousins ' untimely demise was the result of a rather extended and brutal genocide . And what 's more , the children of these barbaric murderers - are actually sitting right in this room . - [ laughter ] And standing at this podium . What happened to the Neanderthal ? To the Denisovans ? To Homo asiaticus and naledi ? Homo sapiens happened . [ chuckles ] We came along and we wiped all of them out . Heh . [ Kolovi ] So I 've been told you 're working on a thesis concerning the evidence for Homo sensorium . - [ Nomi ] That 's right . - In your book , Being Human Beings , you argued for their existence . Does that mean you believe they could still be existing today ? [ laughs ] Look , if you ask me what I know as opposed to what I believe , I know we 've inherited some important bits of DNA from our ancestors and as I suggested in my book , what we gained from the sensorium , the insula of the frontal cortices , which is fundamental to our capacity for empathy , isn 't just any part . Some would argue it is the best part . Can we ask you about one of your students ? Dr. Matheson . Matheson ? Names . Now you 're testing me , Ms. Keene . Your name is uncommonly familiar . Have you written anything I might 've read ? God , I hope so . That would make this so much cooler . We have a picture . Ah , yes . Matheson . Very bright . Quiet , as I recall . Not much of a socializer . That 's him . What about him ? You don 't happen to know how we could reach him ? We found a paper he wrote and we were wondering how he came to some results . No idea . Probably haven 't heard from him since he left . When was this , the ' 80s ? My God , look how young I was . Now , if you have other questions , you can leave them with my assistant . But I really have to run . Genetics lab in ten minutes . Thank you so much for your time . What 'd you think ? I think he was right about the advantage of language over telepathy . Because he could be just a sweet forgetful professor or a really cunning liar . [ Riley ] Okay ... try this . - God , that 's good . - [ both laugh ] It 's from a farm I used to work on when I was young . It was run by three sisters . - They used to love my dad 's music . - Sh , sh , sh ... I told you that details are dangerous . He could be listening at any moment . Sorry . You can feel it , can 't you ? I 'm close . I just wish there was another way . Does she realize she 's protecting you to death ? [ exhales ] - He 's here . - Should I get a shot ? The Will Gorski who used to be a cop . The Will Gorski who came to this island . The Will Gorski who wanted to save Ms. Gunnardottir . That Will Gorski is dying . If he 's not already dead . Your concern 's real touching , Milt . Oh , and that was really slick on the island bait . Did I blink ? Take a breath ? Or was I faking it ... to make you think we are still on some island that we have left months ago ? I know you 've been watching me . Good . How 's it feel ? I admit it 's been a much more trying experience than I had anticipated . But every day brings me that much closer ... to what I know will be a very satisfying catharsis . You have experienced the pleasure of another sensate . I wonder if you 've begun to imagine all the possibilities of pain . I have . You 're not as close to finding us as we are to you . [ Whispers ] Is that right ? Well , tell me , Officer Gorski ... where am I ? Military building . Urban area . How could you possibly know that ? The boots in the hall . The sharpness of the heels . In a rural area , they would be rubber . Your nails are manicured . That 's not something you 'd do in a small town or a base out in the middle of nowhere . The soles of your shoes are also clean . Your suit says city . And so does your pen and your fucking arrogance . And you want me to be a more specific ? Well , how about big city plus England equals London ? You don 't know we 're in England . UK outlet . Same in Singapore , but I haven 't felt air conditioning once . Impressive . Even for a Chicago cop . However , what your keen powers of observation have failed to glean ... is that what we do is older than you and older than me ... and the people on my side know what it is . It is not a game . This is a war . This room ... is a fake . My suit is a costume . This whole place is calculated to make you think I am somewhere I am not . These people are ... professionals . And you are a fucking amateur . Now it 's my turn . - Is it ready ? - We know you never left Iceland . - No , you can 't . - Stop it , Will . The medication labels , all in Icelandic . The sound of the sea . The seagulls might as well have been speaking Icelandic . The jar of skyr ? We even know the fucking farm it came from : Three Sisters . But none of that is as colossal a mistake as you hiding here . Is it a church ? So like your mother . Hurry . Do it now . [ Whispers ] There are very few empty buildings like this one on an island so small . It won 't be long , you 'll hear the sound of a helicopter ... and then she 's mine . You 're all right . You 're safe . [ recording of bird sounds plays ] [ sounds stop ] He only took me there on special nights when he had to make up for something . But the Jjamppong was incredible . That 's where I think we should go on our first night out . - Sounds perfect . - Yeah . Very nice . I love Jjamppong . Especially with too much soju .

Oh ! - [ muttering ] - [ laughs ] - Not exactly subtle . - I gotta look the part , huh ? Being a smuggler and a spy is about looking the part by not looking the part . That 's too many double negatives for me . I 'm too positive for that . You got the stuff ? There you go . Look what I got for you . I made a real effort this time . None of this stuff is exported from Iceland . That 's exactly what they 're looking for . I 'm glad the layover worked out . Nothing 's better than a chance to see my daughter .

This is , um , gonna sound really weird and really awkward and totally inappropriate and I apologize in advance but ... You 've seen my daughter . You 're not the first . Please come in . My husband Jerry , he hated the visitors . The first was a young boy . Will was his name . His father was the detective assigned to my daughter 's case . No one believed me . Not even my dad , but ... she did . You can see her ? You can see our daughter ? She 's next to you . [ gasps ] Sara . She 's holding your hand . [ sobs ] I don 't believe this . I don 't believe in ghosts or souls or any of this bullshit . She 's not a ghost . Then what are you seeing ? A memory . He came back to see me after he had graduated to become a policeman . Let 's just say it wasn 't easy being the son of a cop and ... I don 't imagine it would be . No . No , which is why I was sure ... I 'd never be police . Um ... There I am , I 'm at graduation . I 'm having an out-of-body experience . I 'm looking down at myself , I 'm thinking ... " What the hell am I doing ? Why am I becoming something I never wanted to be in the first place ? " I just couldn 't understand it and , uh ... they call my name ... and I look up and she was there . I saw her . It had been a long time , but , uh ... Sara was there . Then I remembered . I remembered why I was there . We know Sara through Will . How is he ? He 's been better . Is he here now ? Will ... I hope you find some peace . Thank you . He says , " Thank you . " You said there were others who came to talk about Sara ? [ Helen ] Oh , yes . Many of them were complete strangers . It was very hard at first . Especially for Jerry . Remembering was too hard for him . Mom ! It wasn 't that I was waiting for her to suddenly return . I knew she was gone . But when a visitor came and shared their experience of her ... I found it comforting to remember that lives , even as short as hers , can still live on in unexpected ways . Would it be okay if I showed you some pictures of people to see if they were the ones who visited you ? Yes , of course . Oh , yes . She was lovely . Helped me with my garden . [ Neets ] She was an ecologist . [ Helen ] We talked all afternoon . - [ Neets ] Did she talk about Sara ? - [ Helen ] Yes . I believe she connected to her through Dr. Matheson . Um ... Is this Dr. Matheson ? Do you know him ? - We do . - Such a good man . So kind . - He murdered your daughter . - Not helpful . - Sorry ? - How did they meet ? He was her tutor . She was in a Gifted Student program . He thought the world of Sara . I didn 't know what he looked like . I only heard his voice . You tell her ... that I have never given up . And I 'm gonna get him and all the people hiding behind him . You tell her ... I 'm gonna get them all . Will wants me to tell you he hasn 't forgotten ... and that he won 't ever give up . I know . [ growling ] A zoo ? After my parents would fight , my mother would bring me here . She 'd stare at the tigers . One of the last times we came , she asked ... What do you think she 'd do if she ever got out ? Run away . Live in the Tiergarten . Eat rabbits . Hmm ... You 're an optimist . What 's an optimist ? Something most people grow out of . What do you think the tiger would do ? Wait a few hours . And then go back home . Cages are hard . Even for us . Waiting is harder . Will ! [ echoing voices ] Will ! Is this it ? - Kala ! - What ?

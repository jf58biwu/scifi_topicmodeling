 Previously on the expanse ... Her name was julie mao . I flew half-way across the solar system to find her . But I was too late . I 'm truly sorry to be the one . To have to tell you this , But your daughter is dead . Her father had turned her into an experiment . Proceed as planned . He had lots of help . They unleashed some " thing " on a station full of belters . No one knows what it is or does . I met some good people who are trying to stop it . I hope there are others . We barely got out of that hellhole alive . Hell , goddamn ... Some didn 't make it . We 're the only ones who know what 's happening on eros . All I want now is to find the ones responsible . And burn the bastards down . We saved a few . We should 've saved more . We will . Five tangos on the ridgeline . We 're blind here ! Still can 't paint the tangos ! We 're pinned down ! No shelter here . We 're dust if we don 't move . Cover me ! Grab target data when those bastards try to light me up . Got it , gunny ! Travis , right flank ! Hillman , left ! Roger , right . Roger , left . Targets incoming on my nine , high ! Travis , can you shift left ? Negative , I 've got incoming on the right ! They 're lighting her up ! Hillman , stay at your nine ! Travis , throw everything at your six ! Where 's the love , guys ? Three tangos painted , gunny . Four ! There 's one more out there ! Five targeted ! That 's all of ' em ! Tango 's down . We own this crater . Three-four olympus , 612 . Your best course time by almost three minutes . Good work , gunny . Nice job , kids . Return to drop . You wait until you see our next run , lieutenant . The skies will be crying just to please us . No more " next runs " gunny . You 're shipping out . Rumor is you 're heading to phoebe station . So say your good-byes and kiss your mommies . It 's going to be a long trip . Don 't worry , hilly , Your inheritance will still be there when we get back . Damn right it will , travis . How many terraformers her family own , anyway ? All of them . Son of a bitch . I 'll catch up with you in a minute . Roger that , gunny . Someday . So , other than being blasted . By 50 times the lethal limit of radiation , You 're doing surprisingly well . Who knows , Maybe you 'll develop superpowers that you can use . That 'd be perfect for you . That infection on eros , It didn 't get on the rocinante . So , stop beating yourself up . You made it . Maybe we should let the guys on tycho handle this . Then whatever 's in there . Will belong to fred johnson . Roger that , boss . Whatever the anubis crew put in there , That safe is designed to protect the hell out of it . You okay ? I need to pee . I 'm peeing right now . Perks of the vac suit . Go . I got this . I 'm not going anywhere . Because you miss this . The days when we 'd work on a core , just the two of us , Not having to say ten words together all day . Lifetime ago ? Take it easy . Temp gauge . That 's a cryogenic chamber at the core . It 's losing power . Which also means whatever it was freezing . Is going to become ... Unfrozen . There you go . Clean as a whistle . All right , step right up . What happen if one of us infected ? We 'll cross that bridge if we get to it . You mean you gonna space us . You know we 're all taking this test , right ? It 's just a precaution . That why the door . To this room stay locked from the outside , ke ? You martian , keya ? This a martian ship . Haven 't seen a martian ship dock at eros for years . Or an earth ship , for that matter . Now all we see is the prison barge . Or transports , full of tourists . Looking for cheap gambling , and cheap sex , Which is good , ya , 'cause it keep our children with jobs . I 'm sure earth and mars , They 're fixing to send out relief ships . Yeah , yeah . I see the newsfeed . Traffic jam to eros ! Hey , give me that arm ! I think maybe you wanna space us , Whether we test positive or not . Give him your arm and shut your mouth . Or I space you myself . All right ! Nobody is spacing anyone . Low-life sebakawala . We should go back . Whatever happen , maybe it 's over now . Maybe some still left alive . Lot more could 've been saved . You even try ? Look at that . All clear . And the quarantine of eros station . Continues to be a source of debate , As relief organizations testify . Before the general assembly , urging the u.N ... Jurisdictional issues ... Hey , you been having trouble ... What ? Working the plumbing ? No . Which end ? Alpha , omega ? You know ... 'cause I just took an explosive ... Never mind ! Never mind . Okay . At least we get to keep our hair . Hooray . That julie mao went through the same shit . I bet she didn 't bitch about it , right ? Don 't talk to me while I 'm dying , kid . And why won 't we help eros ? Because they 're only belters . Somehow less than human ? Because eros is some backwater . That doesn 't deserve basic humanitarian aid ? See , they picked eros to test their weapon on . Because they knew . Nobody would give a shit . About 100,000 belters . They 'll answer for it . Truth and justice . You still believe that , after everything you saw ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm gonna hold onto that for a little while . Me , I don 't care much if justice gets involved . I just ... I just want them dead . Hey . I never did say it , but thanks . For getting me off eros . I wouldn 't have made it without you . Thanks for the lift . And the cancer . Shit . Madam , did our government build those stealth ships . That destroyed the donnager ? I want your viewers to listen closely . The engines in those ships were built by the opa . Operatives working for fred johnson . Fred johnson was a military hero . Who became infected . With the cause of his own enemy . He turned his back on earth . With his own fleet , He believes he can go . From being a terrorist to a statesman . He cannot . My father taught me something . Never listen to what people say . Just watch what they do . Hello ? Madame secretary . Hello ? You must leave the area now ! Hello ? The signals are being jammed . Hold on , I can 't hear you . The u.N. Ship is down and on fire . Archangel is secure . We have archangel . Archangel was not on the vehicle . Protomolecule seems to behave uniquely . In each subject , Mutating rapidly in each different biomass . The level of the information density required . For the variety of outcomes I 'm seeing is of a magnitude . I can 't explain . " protomolecule . " they gave the goddamn thing a name . Phoebe station is where it all started . These must be the martians that lopez told you about . They were infected on purpose . These are lab notes . The only way to see what it 's evolving into . Is by feeding it a larger biomass . He 's talking about eros . In making your decision , consider this , Phoebe was an extra-solar object . Trapped by saturn 's gravity eons ago . What if it were merely a delivery system ? A way to send the protomolecule . To our solar system ? It begs the question , sent by whom ? And why ? Did he just say what I think he said ? He said , " extra-solar object " . First proof of extraterrestrial life . And it 's just more death . You still got a beat on that signal . That you guys intercepted leaving eros ? Yeah . Of course we do . What the hell are we waiting for ? You 've got an address . This is a gunship ... We have no idea what 's waiting there . No idea how long they 're sticking around . Maybe they already know . That you picked up their scent . We 're not going in blind . Tycho first . Cap 's right . Nobody asked you , no-neck . The protomolecule . What are we going to do with it ? Simple , we stick it on the end of a torpedo . And we fire it into the sun . Yeah , that 'll do it . Hang on . What if there was a way to use that sample . To create a vaccine ? Maybe still help those people on eros ? Those people are beyond help . You don 't know that . None of us know what we 're dealing with here . And until we do , That is too important to destroy right now . Well , I 'm not keeping it on the roci . I won 't take that risk . I sure as heck don 't want to share a bunk with that . Hell no . Then we 'll hide it . Where ? Out here . No one knows we have it . No one even knows we made it off eros alive . It 'll be safe . There 's an idea . I could take a look around . See if there 's a good spot . All right . Alex , do it . She 's doing it again ! You can do it ! You can do it ! You got this ! Hey , hey ! You owe me a bottle . Ganymede bourbon , not the cheap shit ! Gonna put in for new gear one of these eons ? Come on . Me and this armor . Have been through the shit together . We got a history . I can picture it , now . You , in that suit , planting the martian flag . In the statue of liberty 's tiara . Earth won 't even be a real fight . Thirty billion lumps of shit , Watching vidscreens , stuffing their faces . Full of free drugs all day . Hell , we should invade right now . You know the second-most dangerous thing . In the solar system . Next to a martian marine , is a u.N. Marine ? Whoa , the earther chimes in ! Yeah , I 'm more martian than you , hilly . My parents had to sacrifice to have a kid on earth , Immigrate here when I was five . We chose mars . Mars chose us . Hey , hey , he has a point , hillman . The only thing that makes you a martian . Is falling out of your mother 's gravity well . How many brothers and sisters you have ? I lost count at 40 . Travis can 't hide from earth . By putting on that martian armor . His bones are all wrong from growing up in full g . We 'll keep him anyway . Hey ! Watch it ! All right , kids . Keep it business . Well put , gunny . Lieutenant . Briefing in five . I think I hear something . Violins . Schubert in d-minor . I think the lieutenant has the hots for you , bobbie . Shut your hole , or I 'll assist you with that . C 'mon , take one for the team . That way we 'll always have the inside scoop . I would do him , if he buttered . His bread on the same side as me . I don 't use sex as a weapon , little ones . I use weapons as weapons . You 'll be landing on phoebe station , Securing the facility until we get a science team in . For a deeper investigation . After phoebe went silent , The donnager was sent to investigate . Every one of the bodies . Was frozen to the walls of the ice tunnels . It looks like they were incinerated . It 's possible there was a fire or chemical spill . But all of the data cores have been wiped clean . This is a cover-up . We still don 't know what any of it means , Or whether or not earth was involved . Expecting any u.N. Elements ? We don 't anticipate engagement . Lucky for them , because there isn 't a team on this ship . That doesn 't want payback for the donnie . In any case , we will keep it business . Not rumors . Aye , lieutenant . Prep your teams . Dismissed . Gunny . Up here . I know that you and your team did a rotation on the donnie . I knew people on that ship too . Captain yao was a friend . But still , nobody knows what really happened . We know those stealths were earth-built . So says fred johnson , mouthpiece for opa terrorists . And now earth is accusing him . We will not be led into war on anyone 's leash . I was a private during the vesta blockade . Half the earth 's fleet was headed to mars , To annihilate its former colony . If they couldn 't have what we built , They were going to pound it back into dust . We went to bed every night thinking that we would wake . In nuclear fire . Luckily for everyone , Cooler heads prevailed . We all grew up with that story . Because it was a warning . We 've managed to avoid a shooting war . With earth up till now . That 's our job . To make sure that that war never happens . And because of vesta , We pushed back the terraforming project . Fifty years and 50 more . All those resources to the military . Now , none of us will live . To see an atmosphere over mars . That was the price . But it 's still worth fighting for . Be safe down there . There 's been a development . The martians dispatched a ship to phoebe station , I know . What are you doing about it ? Well , that depends . I 'm assuming there 's nothing left to find there . Is there ? Routine scrutiny would 've passed muster , But this feels urgent . Like the martians know something . You need to get boots on phoebe first . That sounds like your mess . And sending a u.N. Warship . To a meaningless outpost like phoebe . Will just draw more attention to it . If you want a weapons system from my project , Then it 's our mess . Sell the u.N. On a story . Make it stick . We need to talk about eros . Mars and earth may be busy pointing guns at each other , But those quarantine beacons . Won 't keep people away from eros forever . There 's already a lot more do-gooders than we expected . Next will be the looters . Then get rid of them . Yes . Of course . I 'll sacrifice what 's left of my credibility . For a few short-term trinkets . Sadavir . You 're witnessing a discovery . That could rewrite the story of humankind , But your imagination takes you as far as . Putting the boot heel to your former colony . This was julie 's spot . Far from the house , Where no one could find her . Where she could find her adventures . She taught herself to shoot a bow and arrow at this tree . Nine years old . Just woke up one morning , and taught herself . My julie . Even losing her was worth it . She 's a sacred part of it now . So don 't talk to me about sacrifice . Ever again . This 'll kill any cancer . That dares try to grow inside you . How long I got to wear this ? Rest of your days . But you won 't be able to procreate . I 'm sorry . It 's all right , I put swimmers on ice in the navy . I 'd never want to see another one of me . Running around anyway , so ... If you need a few more days , we ... No , no . A ship needs a captain . I don 't know how you 've managed without me . Yeah , we 've all been a wreck . All right . Now that we 're all done being irradiated , I 'm think I 'm gonna go . I 'm gonna go check out this . Famous coffee machine you keep talking about . Other way ! If you and I have something we need to get sorted out , We should get to that . Yeah ? We 're here now . Your pal , semi ? You 're upset about that , right ? I had nothing against him . I thought he was a decent guy . Decent guy ? Yeah . Do you think you would 've got off eros without him ? No . But he wasn 't a good enough friend to wait for you . No , no , no . Semi was right . It was stupid to wait . But naomi made the call , end of story for me . And when your pal pulled a gun , Might as well have shot himself in the head ... Here 's what I see , okay ? You seem kind of like a trigger-happy whack job to me . So , let me lay it on the table for you , all right ? You shot my friend , Like some street rat . Wow . So ... If you need to square up , you know where I am . Otherwise , you should move on . Because you 're poisoning the air on ... Stay down , miller . Amos ! Amos ! No ! Amos ! Amos , stop . Amos , stop it . I told him to stay down . Okay , okay . Just go . Go . Are you okay ? Watch the deck . Come in . Chrisjen . Thank god . Are you all right ? Perfect excuse not to quit drinking ? This is our fault . We put you in the crosshairs . We never should have made you the public face . Against fred johnson . It was my choice . Listen , we 're going to beef up your security detail ... I 'm already taking care of that . Intel says it was the black sky faction . Of the opa . They caught wind of an assassination plot . An occupational hazard in my family . Maybe you should take a few days . At least skip the meeting . No . I 'll be in in five minutes . They 're mobilizing for war . Martian ships are moving throughout the system . The morrigan to titan . The africanus to callisto . And the scirocco to phoebe . What are you recommending ? That we secure all our bases in the outer planets . And head off their ships wherever we can . Most of those bases . Are low-level research outposts or cargo waystations . If we place our ships in the paths of theirs ... They 'll know we 're ready . For any planned acts of aggression . We share all those bases . They have no right ! Mars doesn 't want war . They want to get back to terraforming . And building domes for their people . Sir , if we de-escalate , I am convinced that they 'll respond in kind . And erode our position . If mars decides not to give peace a chance ? Sir , we 're the most powerful nation in the system . We need to act like that . Pride isn 't power . And what vast font of battlefield wisdom . Are you drawing from , admiral ? I advise that we deploy our fleet to secure any base . That might become a martian foothold . Madam . Do you concur ? I do . Re-deploy the fleet . Am I bothering you ? Yeah . I was just , um ... Organizing all my stuff here . Then I realized ... I don 't have any stuff . This thing with you and amos ... I 'm pretty sure . He 's not your fella , right ? Sematimba was a good man . He 's more like your kid . Your 200 pound , homicidal kid ... Caught in a terrible moment , And he did what he thought he had to . So did amos . Antenna 's busted . Amos is different . Yeah . Okay , very different . But he 's not crazy and he 's not evil . He 's just always needed someone . To help him out with the world . And he picked you . Congrats . Do you know that old story , pinocchio ? No . No , I don 't . Never mind then . I get it . I think . You 're ... Kind of like his guide star , right ? Lighting the way , and all , through the dark . Like julie is to you . How long , you and her ? Never met her . I only saw her that one time . After they 'd already killed her . I spent a lifetime watching . All the evil shit people did to each other . Nothing " got to me " anymore . Holden was shocked by eros . I was shocked it hadn 't happened a long time ago . But julie ... I wake up some nights , And I see her standing right there . I know it 's bullshit , but ... she 's right there . She takes my hand . She tells me , " you belong with me . " I 'm pretty sure I don 't belong here . This ship . So you 're leaving us already ? You gonna just walk out into space ? What kind of pathetic belters are we ? We used to be a lot better at losing . Then we need to stick together . Yam seng . The unn nathan hale . Is on a direct course to phoebe station . When we accelerated , they matched . And now e nathan hale is burning us . At this rate they 're going to beat us there . Why would earth suddenly care about phoebe station ? Must be something there they don 't want us to find . But command was unequivocal . Under no circumstances . Are we to allow phoebe to fall under u.N. Control . Prepare your team for drop . Who 's gonna feast on earth 's sky . And drink their rivers dry ? Mmc ! Who 's gonna stomp their mountains . Into fine martian dust ? Mmc ! Till the rains fall hard on olympus mons , Who are we ? Mmc ! I can 't hear you ! Mmc ! Who are we ? Mmc ! Good to see you , cotyar . If you 'd known it was me , would you have come ? Probably not . The last time I saw you was at charanpal 's funeral . I suspect my son would have been going gray by now , too . You seem pretty relaxed . For someone who nearly got blown up . You sure a walk in the park . In full view of the drones is a good idea ? I don 't believe lightning strikes twice . What do you want ? I want you on my security detail . I 've been out of the network for a decade , I handle freight security for a small firm . With the luna run . Spare me the bullshit , I know all about your freelance work . You 're a first-rate spy with a robin hood complex . You like screwing over the powerful . To help the little guy . You break the law and you don 't get caught . You 've kept a scrapbook on me . Don 't flatter yourself . You have skills . Which I thought might be useful someday . And this shadow government ? I assume they 're working with fred johnson ? I have no love for fred johnson ... But in this matter , His hands are clean . Then you 're one hell of a liar on the news . A little theater , to buy some time . I 'm being set up . When my investigation dead-ends , I 'll make an excellent scapegoat . Who are the players ? Undersecretary errinwright . Christ . I assume others . Do they suspect you ? If they did , I 'd be dead already . I don 't have time to waste . I need a spy . Are you in or out ? All right , cowgirl , I got a nice little resting spot for that nasty blue goo . How you doing out there ? Good . The proximity detectors are ready to go . Now if anyone comes near this missile , we 'll know it . You okay there ? I think all that radiation failed to give me superpowers . Usually , when we 're in dangerous situations , You hide your nerves . By asking weird , inappropriate questions . Do I ? I hope that hasn 't been irradiated out of you . Was sort of endearing . No . No , I don 't think it has . So ... Do you like space gladiator movies ? Hey , I just lost holden 's mic . Can you hear me through the mask ? Yeah . I can only imagine what you saw on eros . Or what it was like to nearly die that way . We did not choose this , but this is our fight now . We 're the only ones who know what 's going on down there . The only ones with a chance to stop it . Tell me that you 're okay . This crew . Is depending on me . You 've put your lives in my hands . I 'm okay . Ha ha ! Here , here . Sorry . It 's all right . Sorry . What the hell ? This is a ground operation , why are we firing missiles ? Command must have forgot . To check with us first , private . Game faces on . We still have our orders . Unn command confirms that the mcrn scirocco . Fired five missiles . In response to the nathan hale 's . Hard-burn towards phoebe . My god , they 've done it . Not yet . It takes two to play war . There 's a 20 minute delay from the a.O. By the time we get a full assessment , The hale and the scirocco could both be dust . We have to anticipate the worst . Phoebe 's a backwater science station . What are they trying to protect ? It doesn 't matter . They 're making a move . As we speak , the martians could be preparing a strike . All over the system . Have any of their other ships changed course ? Or launched ? Or done anything provocative ? Madam , by the time you see it . On that display , it will be too late ... I know how the thing works . Answer my question . As of 20 minutes ago , no . That doesn 't sound like a first strike to me . The missiles are a message to back off . Nothing more . The captain of the hale will likely fire back . On the scirocco , as he 's authorized to do . The mcrn will retaliate . Phoebe may be the spark , but it will not end there . The captain of the hale knows what 's at stake . He 's a man of restraint . He 's one of our finest . You know captain yvgeny ? Since he was a little know-it-all at the academy , Debating me in philosophy . I promise you , sir , He is the same wise man he was back then . The wise thing to do right now is to target the mcrn fleet . System-wide . Mars isn 't stupid enough . To start a war that will end civilization . Over a rathole like phoebe . Let this saber-rattling play out . We 'll hold , until we hear from the hale . God have mercy on us all . I didn 't know we shared captain yvgeny as a friend . An exceptional man . Yes . Who never went to the academy . Command , The nathan hale has not fired on the scirocco . Their missiles were not intended for us . I repeat , their missiles were not intended for us . Command , be advised , we are standing down . The martians were targeting phoebe research station , Which sustained multiple direct hits . The ice moon fractured under the barrage . And the fragments spiraled into saturn . It 's completely gone . Wish I had your hat for you , amigo . Are we even now , or ... I still owe you one , don 't I ? We 'll figure it out . Alex ! Yeah . What 's the emergency ? Okay , it 's kind of an emergency . So , listen . I 'm thinking to myself , I 'm thinking , How often do we all just hang out together and just talk , You know , without work ? No , no , without work . Hey ! Listen , listen , listen . So I 'm thinking to myself , And I say to myself , " self " , " we ought to just do that , right ? " So . Vee-o-walla ! That 's lasagna . It 's " voila " . Sit down . So that , my hungry friends , Is a kamal family recipe . It 's a staple of the mariner valley . Now , granted , we had to improvise a little bit , Without any real cheese , or wheat , Or tomatoes or anything . Damn , alex , you 're getting us . Really excited about this lasagna . Now , don 't go judging it before you taste it , earther . It 's not bad , martian . You know , I remember a time on ceres . When there was real cheese ? They busted that black-market curd-cartel on ninth level . Real cheddar , from real cows . Damn , they had cheese in the street for weeks , I remember that . Coming out of every nook and cranny . Bricks of cheese and wheels of cheese , And peace , love and brotherhood , As long as that lasted . Then , it was gone . I busted that cartel . Yeah , it was me and star helix . We confiscated about . One thousand kilos of high-grade cheddar . It was bound for some luxury spa on titan . That stuff was out of vermont , too . Craziest thing , though , The whole shipment disappeared . From the evidence lock-up that night . So , it just vanished . Yeah , the , um ... Security cameras shorted out . What ? Nobody saw nothin ' . So the governor of ceres . Gathers all the star helix cops together . For an ass-tearing . This guy wants to know what is the plan . For catching these dubious , nefarious ... Cheese thieves , right ? So he 's there , he 's tearing us a new one . Meanwhile , the whole room stinks like cheese farts . I think I know that governor . Teddy the detector , this guy was not ! Who ? Teddy the detector ! Yeah ! The little kid , the little robot , Teaches you about the air sensors , no ? I think I 'm too young . Teddy the detector detects ... Goddamn , that was great cheese . You 're right . Cover me ! Grab target data . When those bastards try to light me up . Got it , gunny ! Travis , right flank ! Hillman , left ! Roger , right . Roger , left . Targets incoming on my nine , high ... Same old shit , " hurry up and wait , " . Look , gunny , we ... We got an intel flash . The hale was carrying 10 times our number . We weren 't going to send you down to a slaughter . One of us is worth 20 of them . They wanted something on phoebe and we vaporized it . I 'd say the fight 's coming , soon enough . I hope you 're wrong . Earth knows the price of escalation . As well as we do . You said our job is to prevent a war with earth . Ever wonder if we 've got it backwards ? Maybe we can 't have the dream of mars , Until we 've had that war ... They 're lighting her up ! Three tangos painted , gunny ! Four ! The nathan hale was going to reach phoebe . Ahead of the scirocco . Mars clearly wasn 't willing to let that happen . What was on phoebe that mars didn 't want us to find ? We 'll never know now , will we ? Sir , we precipitated this . By sending a ship to phoebe in the first place ... They weren 't firing on the hale . They intended to miss . A first shot across the bow . Thank heaven captain yvgeny has a cool head . Or we 'd be already glassing each other 's cities . Mars destroyed an abandoned and expendable base . A warning for us to stop shadowing their vessels . Phoebe station was a joint facility run by an earth corp . The only intel saying it was abandoned came from mars . And now two-thirds of their fleet is heading for earth . You think that 's just a training exercise ? They 're burning sunward , that doesn 't mean they 're . Getting ready for an invasion . Admiral nguyen 's point is well taken . We must make a strong response . Then let 's speak in a language . That mars understands . Their helium and titanium supply lines , Which we help defend , Are vital to their terraforming efforts . If we threaten to shut them down ... A trade embargo ? No , what we need to do is order . The nathan hale to take out the scirocco now ... If we go this way , we 're going to be watching . Each other 's ships fall from the skies ... Sir , if I may . The deep radar station on deimos . It 's mostly automated , minimal personnel , Casualties will be light . You want us to attack a martian moon ? That 's a declaration of war . No , it 's a warning . It 's a goddamn serious one , but that 's the point . It shows that we 're willing to strike at the heart . Of their territory . Degrade their command and control at the same time . I like it . A base for a base . I don 't know . How we can get much more proportional than that . I 'd need a resolution from the security council first . We 'll call for a vote immediately . They 'll back you . Sharing the blame does not change what this is . Fleet command will not ... I will not support this escalation . Are you saying you won 't carry out a lawfully given order ? If that 's the case , admiral , I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask ... No need to pretend this is a request , sir . I step down as fleet commander . Rocinante , you are cleared . For station dock at berth c4 . They ditched the gas freighter disguise . Be interesting to hear why . You 're damn right , it will . Shall I meet them on the dock with guns ? We 'll start with conversation . Prepare for docking clamp capture . God ! God , I hate space . You 're gonna want to hear this story . Now what story is that ? Maybe it 's the one about why the rock I sent you to . Exploded into a nuclear fireball ? Or what happened to the opa operative I tasked you to find ? Or , maybe it 's the story . Of where the hell you 've been since then , Without one goddamn word of communication back to me . We were on eros . We barely got out alive . And the only reason we 're here now . Is to see if you want to do something about it . We 're wasting our time here . Let 's get out of here . This guy 's no soldier , he 's too busy counting ' bolts . Who the hell is this asshole ? I 'm the asshole who found your operative . Her name was juliette andromeda mao . In case you 're interested , She died , alone , on eros , waiting for you . Opa chair-jockeys to come help her . What happened on that station ? It wasn 't a biohazard emergency . Someone was testing a weapon . Julie uncovered a plan to unleash this thing on eros . She tried to stop it , she got infected . It was something new . A life form . Possibly extra-solar in origin . An alien life form ? According to the gymonk who discovered it on phoebe . Whoever unleashed it on eros . Dosed everyone with radiation to spread it faster . They set up cameras and sensors , in advance . Eros is an experiment on belters . Everybody down there is dead , they 're dying , They 're being studied , like bugs under a microscope . And they 're beaming the data here . It 's an abandoned communications relay . At least some of the people . Responsible for eros are gonna be there . If we want answers , we have to take that station . It 's floating dark , barely registers on radar . But it 's got a habitat ring , which means someone 's home . The first thing we have to get past is this . That 's a stealth ship . Like the ones they used to kill the donnager . We have a gunship of our own . Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done . If you want to take that station , You need to land an assault team . Do you have any idea of the resistance inside ? No , we don 't . That 's why we 're talking to you . You 're the military genius . Well , I don 't do that kind of thing anymore . And the opa is not an army ... We 're going , with or without you . And if you 'd seen what 's happening on eros , You 'd be right there with us . Julie died for the belt . She believed everything you guys say you 're fighting for . Don 't waste it . Welcome to tycho station . Now this is all commercial districts around here . Restaurants , bars , brothels , all that good stuff . Supply depot 's about four sections in . They 're a friendly bunch , They 'll have whatever you need . Union offices are about two levels down from here , And the tycho station admin , just past that . Y 'all can apply for assistance . At either one of those , if you need . Now your lodgings are gonna be . Right around that corner , all right ? But I can set you up and get you transport . If you want to go somewhere else , so don 't be shy . Hell , I can even get you a job , if that 's what ... I don 't wanna bunk , or a job . I wanna fight the inners who kill my home . This locale has been rated three star . Amos , I think . We should check in on them once they get settled . You do that . They 're rock hoppers , right ? They don 't have the skills for this place . Be a shame if they get stuck in group housing , With some shitty job , right ? Yeah , that 'd be a real shame ... You know the only reason they infected eros . Is because it 's got the poorest belters . In the system , right ? The ones no one gives a shit about ... Are you trying to make yourself feel bad about this ? I 'm gonna feel better when I watch those assholes burn . Look , I 'm for killing whoever needs killing . But it 's not gonna make you feel better . The ones we saved , we only saved by accident . We should have saved more . We saved us . Crew comes first . If we 'd have went back for strays , We 'd end up dead , like them . We should 've at least tried . We could 've filled the roci with people , but we didn 't . What the hell does that say about us ? You can talk all day long about , You know , looking out for yourself ... Minding your own business , just trying to survive . It all boils down to an excuse , And that excuse ain 't worth a good goddamn . When the world is burning down around you . Doing nothing is just as bad as doing the wrong thing . Being a bystander ... I mean , what kind of people are we , That we only help ... I 'm sorry , darlin ' , I think that seat is taken . Your kopeng say he buy me drinks . If I sit here and listen to you . Inventory says we have 7,200 out of 10,000 rounds . If alex burned 2,800 just getting out of the donnager , We may have a problem . Fourteen-millimeter spanner , please . Where the hell do we get more when we run out ? Ybe the mcrn does mail order for their stolen ships . Fourteen-millimeter . Sorry . You seem annoyingly calm about all this . No . I 'm scared shitless . Feeling guilty as hell . Please god , stop trying to take credit . For every damn thing that 's wrong in the universe . I 'm talking about all of you . Being caught up in this ... Alex wants to do something . Amos doesn 't do anything he doesn 't want to . And if you think I 'm going along just because of you ... You never wanted to be on the same team as fred johnson , Or be tangled up with the opa again . I ran with some bad people once . Stupid kids with opa tatts and big ideas . I got involved in some things , And innocent people died . So I said never again . But this time it 's different . After eros ? Are you scared ? I 'm angry . So ... Do you think the others have a sense . About what 's going on with us ? I mean , amos , in particular ? We can make a public announcement , Get everyone on the same page . Or take out an ad . No , it 's just ... I was never clear about how you two ... You know . Well , I asked if you were a couple once . What did he say ? He said he 'd be okay . Throwing me into space without my helmet , But that you wouldn 't like it . Sounds like amos , 16-millimeter . It 's kind of hard to explain . He 's like a brother . We look out for each other . You sure he 's clear on that ? Pretty sure . You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship . Without my helmet , right ? I did . Great . 'Cause I 'm really liking us . Not threatening to kill each other anymore . You threatened to kill him ? Just the one time . Let 's try to behave . And if we can 't behave , we tread lightly . We have bigger things to worry about anyway . All I can tell you is that . We 're assaulting a station . And are expecting heavy resistance . I need 50 people with combat experience . They 'll get top hazard pay . And first dibs on the new equipment contracts . My people have those contracts for three years ... And it time someone else get a go at the tit . We will honor those existing contracts . But we 'll be adding 30 more positions to the nauvoo . The rest will come from other bids , All new work . Yeah , go on , coyo . Keep licking the earther 's hand , Maybe he toss you a few more scrap from his table . It 's not news to me that black sky . Resents my position here . But trust me , Now is not the time for factions or debate . There 's opa . And there is opa . You ? You 're just an earther playing belter . We don 't need you giving us orders , And we don 't need you picking our target . Me and mine , we just hack a u.N. Drone on earth . Came this close to wasting that wupo avasarala . That is how you get the inners ' attention . And how do you suppose that 's gonna play out ? Don 't know yet . But we 've got cells on ceres , on pallas , hygea . When we hit the inners 100 more time , We gonna find out . Well , I 'm sorry I wasted your time . You not wasting my time , earther . You 're the one who don 't belong here . Maybe it 's time real belter . Took what should be ours . Like anderson dawes on ceres . Maybe now ... Maybe now is our time . What happened on eros wasn 't a plague . It was a genocide on belters , Done by those who think we 're weak . Divided . One thousand different tribes scattered across the belt , Who could never unite and fight back . Well , we 're going after those who killed eros . Tell that to your factions . I need 50 good fighters . Send your best . That son of a bitch . Goddamn ! Don 't beat yourself up . That 's your best run yet . It 's that goddamn rail gun . Soon as that stealth points its nose at us , We 're done like dinner . All right , listen . Don 't lose the big picture . Our cargo freighter disguise . Is only gonna fool them for so long . The breaching pods are defenseless . You have to flush out and engage that stealth ship . Or the pods will never make it to the station . Load it up again . Hey , your ship keeps getting killed . If we start further away , they nail us with torpedoes . Get too close , it 's that rail gun . Yeah . It sounds to me like . You 're just picking which kind of dead , pal . Well , alex is playing alone right now . We get a full crew , it 'll be different . Yeah , a crack team of space commandos , you guys . Listen , I hope you understand if I ask you sit this one out . Close quarters battle can get kinda hairy . What the hell use would I ever be on a ship ? Nah , I 'm going down with the assault team . Have you seen the breaching pod ? It 's a beer can taped to a rocket . You 're not gonna like the ride . Fred 's trying to land 50 pissed off belters . And seven different opa factions on that station . I mean , somebody 's gotta keep these idiots . From shooting each other . I ain 't sitting this one out . All right , then . I 'll go clean out my cabin . Leave it . It 'll be waiting for you when you get back . That son of a bitch ! God damn it ! I 'll have ... Gin and tonic with a lime . You 're not as invisible as you think you are . I 'm not on a covert op . I would 've pegged you as a scotch drinker ... I don 't drink often . You 're entitled to celebrate . Your transfer went through this afternoon . Jupiter fleet . Good command . And nguyen gets my old job . Much obliged . Deimos was the smallest move . The secretary general could swallow . Big symbol , minimal body count . Anyone with half a brain knew we were not going to leave . That room without an escalation . I 'm honored you think . You gotta justify your actions to me ... I 'm simply telling you how . Your tantrum got you sidelined . And how does that help your larger cause ? Well , when your war breaks out , I 'll be out there minimizing the body count . Enjoy your drink . Sit . Is that an order ? If that 'll make you sit your ass down , yes . Please . Get him a proper scotch , please . Lagavulin . Now , why don 't you grow a pair . And tell me what you really think . We 're just two people having a drink . No ranks . Here , I 'll get the ball rolling . I 'm a smug old bitch , Who enjoys playing with life and death . On her big chessboard . A snake in a sari ... With dead eyes and a poison tongue . And the solar system is in tatters . Because of people like you and errinwright . Despite your delusions to the contrary , You , madam undersecretary , May be the worst person I have ever met . Feel good getting that out of your system ? That was the plan , wasn 't it ? Yeah , it did . Now , why don 't you grow a pair and tell me why you 're here . Tell me about fred johnson . When he joined the opa . And everyone lined up to stone him , You stayed quiet . Why ? There was plenty said about him . I understand it 's hard to watch a war hero ... You don 't understand shit about fred johnson . Enlighten me . Then you want . The real story ? Yes , I would . I got this from someone who was there , someone I trust . Your predecessors in the previous administration . Buried it . The belters who seized control of anderson station . Had been trying to negotiate for days . U.N.N. Command was jamming their comms , But when the belters finally gave up , Colonel johnson wasn 't told that they 'd surrendered . If he knew , he would have never . Called that strike in . Why wasn 't he told ? Because the powers that be . Wanted to send a message to the belt . " Defy us , we wipe you out . " message sent . And fred johnson switched sides , why ? As a revenge against earth ? The u.N. Pinned a medal on his chest . For anderson station . He was a hero to earth and despised everywhere else . All based on a lie . But you know what ? He never said a word . Didn 't even try to clear his name . Just walked away . So does that make him a hero or a traitor ? I don 't know what it makes him . But I know that he 's an honorable man . Who held onto his soul , And that is a tough thing to do in this line of work . Not bad . But I prefer beer . She 's buying . Didn 't think he had that in him . I need you to do something for me . I 'm sure I 'm going to love it . I need to send a communique , off everybody 's radar . No traces back to me . I want to talk to fred johnson . That is treason , isn 't it ? It certainly is . Beeline pattern on rocinante . Holden . You copy ? I copy . So far , so good . The rocinante is completely hidden in our radar shadow . Your team ready ? It 's getting to be that time . Roger , that . All right , people , here we go . Just stay loose and focus on your job . We all know what we 're in for . We know what we gotta do . Lids on and button up . Copy that . Oy , beltalowda ! We put these cans together in a hurry , It 'll get a little bumpy when the thrusters fire . Bumpier than this ? When you hit the ring , the pod will seal to the hole . The station shouldn 't vent any air . But keep your helmets on anyway , in case . Try not to puke in it . Question . What 's the go-signal for the ... For the assault ? That will explode and turn into a door . Good hunting ! Tenye wa chesh gut ! Stay away from da owkwa ! Stay away from da owkwa ! Star helix ! What you doin ' here ? You lose a bet ? Okay , naomi . Empty us out . De-pressurizing . Alex , the alarm . I 'm on it . I hate this part . You gotta do it . They 'll be poking holes in us . Yeah , but this feels like we 're agreeing to it . All right . Air is in the tank . Rocinante is ready to roll . This should be interesting . On your mark , colonel . I thought I was done with all this . Sending people to their deaths . Before or after you spaced the black sky guy ? Everybody here is a volunteer . That was the old trick . Getting them to believe that it was their own idea . Rocinante , we are a go . Alex ? Make us look like something that got dropped . You got it , hoss . Hey , holden ! Holden ! Didn 't the navy teach you to stow your gear . Before you went into maneuvers ? Attention , this is the freighter . Guy molinari to all vessels within range . This is a legal notification that we are on approach . To a loose cargo container . And have filed a salvage claim . Any interference with our property . Will result in civil action . Hey ! Hey , when did you soldier up ? Last time I saw you , you were ... You were stealing sewer water from the griegas . Wouldn 't have if I knew they were paying in earther scrip . But you used to that , right , star helix ? Hey , man , no need to get nasty . No , really ! What you doing here ? I was on eros . No shit . You see what they did there ? Wasn 't pretty . We gonna burn ' em all down , owala . Make ' em pay ! Did they just cut us loose ? Nah , we with our own air now , is all . You look like you see your own ghost . I just ... Hate ... Space ... What kind of belter are you , pampa ? Don 't worry , I grew up on ship like this . My uncle mateo had this rock hopper . He take me along sometime . I don 't care ... My uncle was a hero . He died fighting the inners . He put me out the airlock first , Because he had love for me . Now I fight like he did . You 're still talking . If another belter ship don 't see the blast . And come for me , I still be on the float . All this just bonus time for me , sasa ke ? Stick next to me , okay ? I 'll look out for you when we land . Oy , pampa . I keep an eye on you , old man . Come on , hoss . Give me the word . We should be close enough by now . Heat her up ! Sensors are up . Where 's that stealth ship ? It 's supposed to be here . Heads up ! We got a bogie on the far side of the ring ! They 're going after the molinari ! Shit , I 'm on it ! Hang on ! Naomi , what 's our status ? The hulls have been breached but the core reactor 's okay . Checking . We 're breathing , it must be good . We 're okay . Zero g , now ! I put the station between us and them , But I don 't know how long I can keep it that way . She 's real sluggish to port ! Aw crap ! We 're down a thruster . We 've lost a feed line to number 16 ! I see it , inner hull at c-9 ! I can patch that ! Amos , stay put ! One hard maneuver and you 're done . We don 't get that thruster back , Then we 're all done . I 'm going . Launching breaching pods now . I see the problem . I 'm going to need a few seconds to fix it . Amos , hurry . We don 't have much time . Rocinante . Alert . Are you seeing this ? There 's a gun on the ring ! Looks like an old anti-asteroid cannon . It 's a dumb gun for breaking stray rocks , It can 't hurt us . No , but it 'll kill the hell out of those breaching pods ! Shit ! Alex , can we take them out ? No , we 're too close for torpedoes . I 'm gonna have to clear the station to fire the pdcs . Do it ! Roger ! What the hell was that ? Sorry , partner , that was us getting our ass kicked ! God damn it ! I need that thruster ! All right , give me a few seconds ! The cannon will be on the breaching pods any second , We have to protect the landing team . That stealth is nearly on our tail . We let them get one more clear shot at us , It 's gonna cut us in half ! Jim , we gotta move out ! Hard burn now . No ! We do that and amos is dead ! We lost a pod ! Done ! Amos , we 're about to do a high-g maneuver . Give me a second ! Okay , secure ! Alex , move ! About f ... ing time ! Surprise , assholes ! Nice work , alex ! Well done ! Whoo-hoo ! Oy , papa , look like nobody home maybe . Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Hold your fire ! Aw , Jesus . You okay ? It was a gel round . Invincible , me ! Gimme that . They 're all using gel guns , Not even fitted up to repel boarders . They look like prison guards . So what the plan , boss man ? All right . Staz , split them up into four groups . Five of you guys come with me . Stay sharp . Everybody stay sharp and watch the doors and corners . Doors and corners are where they get you . You four , with him ? Go , take your men that way . You down there . Alex , which pod was miller on ? I 'm on it . Miller was on the other pod . He made it . Sorry , buddy . You okay ? Yeah . Did we win ? Rocinante , we 're proceeding to hard dock . We 'll see you in the station . All right , everybody on the floor ! Show me some hands ! Now ! Hey . Shit , man ... Hey . Come on , get up . Turn it back on ! Give it back ! Cease fire ! Cease fire , god damn it ! Stop ! Diogo ! Get this guy outta here . Nothing happens to this guy ! Get him outta here ! Got it , star helix . I need these scientists alive , guys ! Guys ... Everybody stay here . Nobody move . All right , turn it off , dirtbag ! Now is the time for all good men to come . To the aid of their species . You . Have we met ? Up . Get up . Miller , stand down . Good . This station is now under opa control . What would it take to make you guys go away , Colonel johnson ? Weapons ? Money ? Political favors ? My benefactors are powerful ... Get his ass out of here . Let 's go . Idiots . Every scrap of data in this facility . Has been encrypted . We know what you were doing on eros . Nobody knows what we 're doing on eros . And every minute I have to spend playing games with you , Takes me away from that work . You 're in an excellent bargaining position . Tell me what you want and we 'll negotiate . You 're going to help us make a vaccine . No . That goes against . Everything we 're trying to accomplish . You infected a station full of belters ... They were infected to save us all . You 're gonna have to be . A hell of a lot more specific than that . We made a discovery on phoebe . An extra-solar lifeform . We found your lab notes on the anubis . Maybe you can appreciate what it is . An organism that can repurpose other life forms . And use them to evolve . Into what ? That 's what we 're trying to find out . In a controlled , isolated environment . That can be sterilized if it gets out of hand . You could 've fed it a vat of bacteria . I 'm not interested in the cosmic fate of bacteria . The protomolecule is proof . That we 're not alone in the universe . And our ticket out of the limitations that bind us . To these pathetic little bubbles of rock and air . If we master it , we can apply it . Apply it to what ? To everything . We become our own gods . Imagine human beings able to live in hard vacuum . Without a suit , Or under the crushing atmosphere of a gas giant . Or able to hibernate long enough . To travel to the stars . That 's why you were willing to start a war ? Have you heard of genghis khan ? He built one of the greatest empires in human history . Killed or displaced a quarter . Of the entire population on earth during his conquests . Today , that 's the equivalent of 10 billion people . Eros is hardly a rounding error by comparison . And that justifies all of this ? Of course it does ! The protomolecule wasn 't sent here by accident . Earth was its target . It was sent to hijack life on our planet for its own ends . You can 't save eros . All you can do now is waste the data . And ensure that every man , woman and child . On that rock died for nothing . The data will erase itself . If anyone other than me tries to decrypt it . Without this work , humanity will be left unarmed , Ignorant , vulnerable , To an enemy who 's already fired the first shot . I don 't care who controls the project . So long as I can get back to my work , With no restrictions . So we have an understanding ? We 're going to need complete access to the data . As well as the names . Of everyone responsible for setting this in motion . Done .

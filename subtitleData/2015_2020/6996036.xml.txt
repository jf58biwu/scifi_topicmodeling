 Is it true ? Jonas is dead . What do we do now ? - Yes ? - My name is Koman Nyagah . I 'm head of the Kenyan Democratic Reform Party . May we have a word ? We are tired . We 're tired of bosses , thieves and thugs . - We 're tired of corruption . - It 's endemic , systemic . We can no longer ignore the injustice . - We want to end it . - We need your help . - We want to fight . - Just as Van Damn would . We want you to run for office . Did Jela put you up to this ? No , my friend . This is not a prank . - We 're dead serious . - We saw you on Kobi Kihara . - You were amazing . - We believe that with your help , we can effect some real meaningful change here . And what do you know about here ? Are you from Kibera ? I thought not . I think you should leave before my mother returns . I 'm not from here . But I don 't need to be to see the unfairness , the injustice . Please , just give our proposal some thought . I 'm not a politician . We 're not looking for a politician . We 're looking for a leader . Welcome home . And you can probably taste a few new spices . Trying it out to see if customers like it . Try . Try this one . Hmm ... Tastes good . I 've added a little bit of saffron and , uh , some ... black spiders . Some shoe leather . So good . And a pinch of horse shit . - My favorite . - Your favorite ? Hmm ? You can taste it ? Sorry . You want to talk about it ? I would , but there 's nothing to talk about . Everything 's perfect . My ... My house , my job , my husband ... Your bodyguard . A very small price to pay for all of this good fortune . - A-ha ! - What ? Here 's a connection . The manufacturer of Angelica 's equipment . How did you get that ? The photos Lito sent from Raoul 's room . God , you 're smart . Abrasax Electronics , still in business , and still supplying technology to guess-what-school 's R and D lab ? University of Chicago . Which could mean the research Angelica was doing at the cabin she took with her to Whispers and Kolovi . - But why would she help them ? - Angels ! I bring glad tidings . I have the solution ... to your problem . Oh , which one ? The one that brought you to Chateau Bug in the middle of the night . Bendix . Ugh ! The cops are never gonna leave us alone . True . As long as you 're alive , yes . But they 'd stop pretty quick if you were dead , wouldn 't they ? - What are you talking about , Bug ? - I 'm talking E-Death . But E-Death is just a rumor . It 's real . Though I use that word cautiously in this post-Homo sensorium relativity of realities . What 's E-Death ? Supposedly something cooked up by the NSA and CIA ... It 's a redaction protocol . They use it when someone 's been renditioned or black-sited and they want zero accountability . - Bug ... - I 've seen it , buddy . They erase warrants , records , anything that might make one agency trip over another one . They just go poof . And so do you . If you can do this , why haven 't you ? I didn 't say I could do it , but I just reached out to the guy that can . What guy ? Not just any guy . The guy . Okay , can we stop with the whole pregnant pause-y thing ? Right . Sorry . Right . Okay . I 'll set it . Up . Sometimes all my good fortune makes we wonder whether I 'm actually appreciating it enough . And if I 'm honest , I have to admit that , no , I 'm not sure I am . Which then makes me think that there must be some flaw in my personality or my brain chemistry , which means I just have to get used to the fact that no matter what happens , I 'm never going to be a person who can ever just ... feel happy . No , that 's not true . Few children in the world ever smiled as easily as my daughter did . What happened to that girl ? Do you remember the doll you wanted so badly on your birthday ? Uh , it had red hair . Anna . God , how you prayed and prayed for that doll . On your birthday , the whole family had come over . There was this huge pile of presents on the table , but none of that mattered . It was like you had this x-ray vision . You went straight to it , ripped it open and that was it . Party over . I loved that doll . As adults , we learn to carefully open all the rest of the presents . We are taught to smile and to pretend that all are equally important to us . But our heart ... always knows the truth . But what if the truth is something that can cause people to feel unhappy or ... or disappointed or ... hurt ? There are times I wish I could go back to being that little girl . My life was much easier then . But I 'm a woman now , and part of being a woman is understanding that hearts are complicated things . They are . They are indeed . What you need is a good meal . Come . Ladies and gentlemen , we 'll now be making a short stop . Buy some peanuts , stretch your legs , admire the view , drink in this wonderful morning . We 'll be leaving in 15 minutes . Good ? I guess so . Hello . I would like to go to NTV . Turn it up . Your sister has murdered three more people . Do you care to comment ? It 's just , uh ... I just wish people could know my sister the way I know her . It 's very hard to connect these terrible crimes with the person I thought of as my big sister . If your big sister is listening , what would you like to say to her ? Big sister ... please , do the right thing . Please turn yourself in before anyone else gets hurt . Sorry . If you didn 't , I would have . Come , let 's get you back where you belong . I would like to speak with a journalist , Miss Zakia Asalache . Please . You 're Van Damn , isn 't it ? Your interview was amazing . Hey . The one and only Kung Fu King of Kibera . Vanquisher of crime lords . - Provider of water to the thirsty masses . - And Internet viral sensation . Though , I 'll be honest , that speech of yours sounded suspiciously like Zakia herself . Yeah , come on , Van Damn . Your secret is safe with us . Zakia invented you , didn 't she ? Invented me ? She may have come up with the story , but there 's no way she came up with that jacket . - That 's definitely authentic . - You mean antique . Yeah , I 'm guessing early Bronze Age . Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said . I don 't know you and I 'm sorry if you have a problem with me . It 's not us who have the problem , if you 're interested in Zakia Asalache . - Yeah . - Why ? Do we tell him the truth ? A bit of a sordid tale here , but when Zakia was studying in London , a story broke out that she preferred lunchboxes to baguettes . I 'm sorry ... She 'd rather slurp on a mango than chomp on a banana . You know , she prefers pussies to puppies . - Dude , she likes girls . - It was a huge scandal for the family . You know , her father 's a serious muckety-muck . All we 're saying is ... If you 've got a dick in those pants , you 've got no chance , bro . Yes . Okay . Okay . Miss Zakia is in meetings all day and cannot be disturbed . I 'm sorry . - Stop . - Could you let her know that ... No , never mind . Thank you . Oh ! Are you okay ? Prison was good for you . Tell me you have a war plan . I have no plan . I have an enemy . And I won 't stop until he 's dead . Or I am . Good plan . Good morning , Will . I love watching a woman wake . A glimpse of her innocence before she begins assembling herself . Riley . Is he here ? True beauty is in that moment of vulnerability . - I have the blockers . - Yeah . You won 't need them . This isn 't a trick , Will . That game 's over for me . Thanks to you , I have the most secure position I 've ever had in the organization . Then what do you want ? I was hoping we could be honest with each other . I guess it 's safe to say you 're in London . When I did my PhD in medicine , I came here for the first time . I 'm in awe of this building . As much a work of art as it is a fortress . Soaring , beautiful vertical lines . The style is called Perpendicular Gothic , widely used after the Black Plague destroyed much of Europe . Is this gonna be on the test ? The Black Plague revealed our vulnerabilities and it terrified people . So what did they do ? They built temples to the immortal like this . Vertical lines descend from heaven , with all the might of the Lord bearing down on a single point until it is utterly and irrevocably crushed . Let me guess ... I 'm that single point . No . I am . I don 't expect you to understand me or my work . Another misunderstood psychopath . I am trying to engineer a future with a species that is more violent , intolerant and possessive than any species in the history of this planet . Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears . And nothing terrifies them like difference . You save your fucking justifications . You murdered an innocent girl . I know you killed Sara Patrell . Who ? There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this . I thought a cop would understand that . Angelica did . She saw our work as the key to the future for both our species . This building is a symbol . Its powerful vertical lines are the assurance of authority . She believed in what we were doing as much as I did . Then why did she put a gun in her mouth and blow her brains out ? Why do soldiers kill themselves ? Or cops ? People who bear the full weight of the truth sometimes break , Will . Angelica broke . Just like one day you or I might break . But then you know all about breaking , don 't you ? You watched it happen to your father , day after day ... though he chose booze instead of a bullet . Let me show you what I know about breaking . Will . Are you okay ? These extremists won 't be happy until they 've dragged the entire world back to Dark Ages . I 'm not sure that 's what they 're after , but I do take your point . Maybe we should just discuss a more pleasant subject . - Good point . - Mm . - This Banjari Gosht is incredible . - Yes , it 's wonderful . The balance between spice and masala ... Sanyam , you 've totally outdone yourself . - Thank you . - If you don 't mind ... Sanyam , do you understand the kind of the future world these terrorists hope to build with their bombs ? It 's not for me to speak for them . Well , somebody should . Somebody should because they themselves obviously can 't speak any other language besides violence . Maybe that was the language that was taught to them . Oh ... Don 't tell me you 're one of those liberals who really believes these psychopaths who murder innocent civilians , - they themselves are the victims . - No , no , no . I 'm one of those silly people who believe that if you kill someone , you should be tried for it , whether you 're a psychopath , a policeman or a president . You 're worse than a liberal . Oh , Daya , may I have some of the Dal ? Dad , the Dal ... phenomenal . One second , one second . Hold on , hold on . Let me ask you something , Manendra . As a government insider , tell me , since the British left , the structure of power , the distribution of wealth , these things remain almost identical . And sometimes , I ask myself ... why ? Maybe a man as smart as you can finally answer this question for me . You know , I think I 'll have a bit more Dal myself . Yes , yes . It 's very good , right ? - Really , I 'm having so much of the Dal . - Mm . Try some , Father ? In my humble opinion , Sanyam , societies remain unchanged because the human beings remain unchanged . Not everyone is born to be a great leader , just as not everybody 's born to be a cook . Okay , I see . Well , spending a lifetime in the kitchen learning how to cook was my destiny , just as inheriting a fortune was yours . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Look at the time ! The conversation has been so stimulating that the evening has just flown by . - Yeah . You have a meeting . - I have a meeting , yes . I don 't know about the rest of you , but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners . Best part of the week . - Sadly , we have to head home now . - Yeah . - Bye . - Good evening . Bye , Mum . Bye . Mm ? This one ... This one 's not bad . - How many pages ? - Nine . But it 's good . It 's the hero 's brother . - Let me guess , the sensitive brother . - Lifelong bachelor . - But at least he doesn 't die from AIDS . - So he does die . Drug overdose . I don 't know . It 's still a notch up from ... " serial killer who talks with a soft lisp and wears mascara . " You think that 's bad ? Listen to this . " The Hispanic coke dealer is about to give another kind of blow job when he finally gets the bullet he deserves . " I told you . I told you . This is it . This is how careers end . You either take the roles you hate or you sit at home - until you 're completely forgotten . - Lito , you 're not gonna be forgotten . Your films are so good and you have so many fans . Had . I had fans , Dani . - Look at my Twitter feed . - Hey , you promised no social media . But it 's evidence . It 's evidence , Hernando . It proves no one wants anything to do with me . Well , that is not true . Somebody wants you and here 's the proof . An all-expenses-paid trip to São Paulo . São Paulo ? I 've never been . - Is it an offer ? - Yes . Is it a ... Is it a movie offer ? As the grand master of the São Paulo Gay Pride parade . - Oh , my God ! That 's amazing ! - Come on , guys . What ? What ? Last year they had over five million people . - Are you serious ? - It sounds so fun . Come on , Lito . You have to go . Maybe this is just what you need . To remember how many people are affected by what you did . Yeah , great idea . Then El Tempo can publish pictures of me with five million people in thongs , leather and feathers . I can 't wait for the scripts we get after that . Family , please , try to understand what is happening here . I 've been typecast . This is prison for an actor . I 'm trapped here not because of what I did , but because of who I am . This is painful enough to think about . But worse ... is facing the idea that ... there may be no way out of it . What the fuck ? What ? It 's Lito . What the fuck ? You know Lito Rodriguez ? He 's in my cluster . Lito Rodriguez ... is one of the voices in your head ? - Shh ! Bug ! - Right . Sorry . Shh ! All good . I 've seen this film , like , ten times . Okay . The Bug does not do fanboy , but if you wanted , you could tell him , you know , nice work . Really ? - Tell him yourself . - What ? He 's sitting right there . Holy shit . Be cool , Bug . Perdón ? Major honor , Mr. Rodriguez . Thank you . You speak Spanish ? The language of love is the Bug 's native tongue . I thought that was French . Love this part . " No more lies . " - " No more lies ! " - No more lies ! Always gets me . This is where it belongs . This is it . Mm . I love it . Ah ! The light of my life . - You remember Ajay . - Of course . Ajay is laying out the plans for the new tower . 21st Century India . And we are building it right here . Yeah . Very impressive . - You texted ? - I did . Um , excuse us , please . - I 'll be back . - My office . Could be up there someday . Now , how can I help ? I wanted to go over the reports . I 'm finding inconsistencies between our drug samples and the quality reports , and I 'm very confused by some of the data from the controller general . I wouldn 't really stress out about it . I mean , all the CG really wants from us is for us to say that we are doing the best we can . I 've been through it a million times with the lawyers . Really . I mean , these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances . - But ... - What matters is that we ship on time . Our clients are depending on us , as I am depending on you . Come , let 's go . So , Bug , where is he ? Who ? You said we were meeting your guy here . Not my guy , the guy . Well , where is he ? Etvoilà . I 'm the guy . - Holy shit . - Shh ! Be cool . Hello , Nomi Marks . You know who I am ? We 've had our eyes on you . That 's kind of cool and kind of creepy . Yeah , it sounded a little stalkery . Didn 't mean it like that . What did you mean ? Bug 's been a bud for a while . We know what you did for him . When he told us about your troubles , we looked into it , shall we say ... anonymously . - And what did you find ? - How many languages do you speak ? Seven . And , you know , some shitty French from high school . You 're Homo sensorium . You know about us ? Anyone that 's interested in the truth knows about Homo sensorium . And those three unpleasant letters . BPO . Who are they ? Another secret security organization that needs to be taken down . - How ? - We don 't know . They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we 've come across . But ultimately , all that power testifies to one thing . - What ? - How afraid they are of people like you . Right now , all we can offer you is a little ... invisibility . E-Death . If you accept this offer , there may come a day when we ask something of you . What ? Nothing venal , vile or vainglorious . Rather a vital vertex of virtue , valor and virtuosity in the name of veracity . Wow . Did you just come up with that yourself ? - No . There 's an app for it . - Ah . Hello ? Fuchs ? Anybody home ? Felix ? Hello ? Where the fuck is everybody ? Pretty , isn 't it ? Where 's Fuchs ? Shanghai . So there was no meeting . I thought it was time for us to get to know each other a little better . What do you want from me ? Am I being too subtle ? - Playing hard to get ? - I 'm not interested in playing at all . Wolfgang , I 'm sorry I lied about the Fuchs meeting , but it 's getting very complicated . You know what 's going on , don 't you ? Fuchs left town . You 're following Volker . It 's not rocket science . He 's going after the other kings . That 's his choice . Maybe it will work out for Sebastian , maybe it won 't . What I 'm going to make sure is that it works out for me . Hm . - And maybe ... - Me . It 's been a while since I 've met one of us as tempting as you . I told you , I 'm not interested . You might not want to admit it ... but we need each other . You 're wrong . I don 't need anyone . Hello . Mun . From Seoul Metropolitan Police . I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak . Hope is undiscovered disappointment . I hope to keep her alive . Do you ? - Come on . - Thank you . You , uh ... Oh , thank you . You know her well , don 't you ? I was her teacher . When I was a young man , I fought her once . But she used a different name . Her father did not approve of women fighting . Ah . I was stupid like him , too . I was cocky . And then she kicked my ass . She did that a lot . I never forgot it . But I became better because of her , though . Many people have made up their mind about Ms. Bak , and I was wondering about you . Do you think she has done all the things that she 's been accused of ? The person I trained ? The person I know ? This is not the same person the TV talks about . Just between the two of us , something stinks in the story of her escape . For some reason , the security camera covering her cell was out , as was the one in the laundry hall . And the guards , they were not from the prison . They came from Seoul . Mm . The tea is still warm . Did you just have a guest ? A friend . I figured . Ms. Bak , I think , could use a friend . Look , what she 's trying to do , as good as she is ... she cannot do alone . Thanks for the tea . - How long will it take ? - I don 't know . I never redacted anyone before . Uh-oh . What was that ? - Oh , my God . - What ? I alarmed the police reports on you and ... Jesus . - What ? - They 're gone . BOLO 's gone , wants and warrants gone , person of interest gone . Shit . It 's official . I 'm dead . Hello . It 's good to see you . Good to see you , too . Tequila ? - Please . - Squared ? Cubed . Eight ? Eight . I 've been hoping you would come back , so I could say thank you . Why ? When you burst in here the last time , you were so full of fire and with a sense of fearlessness . And then you kissed me and ... Well , let 's just say I was ... inspired . I got home that night and I proposed to my boyfriend , and we got married . That 's my Pepe there . Hello , Pepe . How are you ? We had the best year of our lives . But I know I would have never been brave enough to do it ... without that kiss . Courage . It is contagious . Well , the drink 's on us . Thank you . He 's right . Nothing changes if we keep playing it safe . Look at me . Look at us . We 're hiding in holes . Whispers has turned me into a fugitive . He 's got me acting like one and thinking like one . I 'm not . I 'm a cop . A fugitive runs because he 's alone . A cop knows he 's not . Whispers showed me something . Something I 've been missing . It 's the scale of this fight . Why does BPO have so many resources ? It has to be because there is a lot more of us out there than we thought . - We need ... - ... to find them . Vincent , this is Riley . We risked so much to get you free , Riley . It seems very dangerous to me , exposing ourselves like this . Vincent offered us protection . Guys , are we really going to put our lives in the hands of someone like Vincent ? What do you mean someone like Vincent ? - Someone who ... - Doesn 't like his movies . Nah . Nah . Well , I mean , taste in movies says a lot about someone . Sun ? You can 't win a fight protecting yourself . Nomi ? A coded media alert can make it almost impossible for cops to respond fast enough . Not just the plan . What do you think about the risk itself ? Your life is either defined by the system ... or by the way you defy the system . Wolfgang ? Fear never fixed anything . To courage . The one and only Riley Blue ! Uh ... hi . I don 't usually talk up here . But I need to say something I should have said a year ago . I wasted a lot of my life with my eyes looking down . Afraid of anything beyond the next step . And then something happened to me . Someone reminded me to look up . And I wanted to tell that someone thank you . I wanted to tell you that I love you . I love you . Tonight , I want everyone in this room to know ... that I see you . I believe in you . And as long as we 're together ... I know that there 's nothing we can 't do . Holy shit ! This was careless , Will . No . This was amazing . - The cops are coming . - Cops are coming . We gotta get her out . See you soon , Milt . - Sorry , love . Fun 's over . - He 's the club owner . Come on . - Gotta go . - Cops are coming . Gotta go ! Gotta go ! Oh ! No ! You idiots ! No ! Outside ! Outside !

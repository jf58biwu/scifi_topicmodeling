 When will the stew be ready ? It 'll be ready when it 's ready . A good meal takes time . Hungry now . You 're always hungry . Ain 't my problem . My problem 's your cooking . You ever gonna make anything edible ? When are you gonna act like a man , instead of sitting here whining ? Looks like shit . Tastes like it too . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - How does it feel ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? Get off me ! What are you doing here ? Trying to stay warm . Don 't these coasties know how to keep a fracking fire going ? - Aren 't you- - ? - Dead ? Checked out ? Taking the old dirt nap ? Don 't look at me . You 're the one dreaming this up . Dig the beard . Very anti-establishment , screw the man and all that but I gotta ask . - What are you trying to prove ? - Maybe I just like the way it looks . Makes you look like one of the Village People . What the hell are you really doing here , Alan ? I 'm trying to stop Ilaria . By traipsing through the forest with a bunch of sailors ? Not to mention this Kyle guy , who 's trying to get your butt thrown in federal prison . Ilaria have come up with a new pathogen . - I 'm not sure why , but- - - Horse shit . You and I both know that ain 't the real reason you 're out here . Of course it is . Humor me . First , you were trying to save Julia . Then you were hunting a bunch of immortals in Paris . And now you 're trying to find a cure for this pathogen . Seems to me like you 're a man in search of a mission . - I know why I 'm here , Doreen . - Oh , I don 't think you do . And you need to wake up . You hear me ? Wake up , Alan . Wake up . Alan , wake up . Keep at it , I 'll put that boot up your ass . I just figured you might want to stay with the gang here . But sleep till noon if you want . - Look , we don 't have to get along- - - We don 't get along , doc . But we 're in this together , like it or not , so let 's get it done . You get a head count ? Okay , take three men . Maintain visual contact . Check the perimeter . - Yes , ma 'am . - What 's happening ? - One of our guys hasn 't reported in . - You 're with me . Must have just overslept . I know you 've been through unspeakable horror . The loss of friends and loved ones . But I can promise you , we will prevail . Say it with me . We will prevail . When will it be safe for us to eat or drink ? Dr. Farragut has assured me that our remaining food and water supplies are uncompromised . Why did Michael lie to us ? - Why did he kill everyone ? - What Michael did was a terrible mistake . You 're all safe now . The CDC- - Michael said the CDC was here to keep us safe . - But they brought the sickness . - No . That 's absolutely not true . Lies and more lies . Michael , who called himself our brother fell prey to the evil words of the outsiders and now my mother is following his path . - How dare you speak to me that way . - I will speak to you any way I like ! We 're no longer afraid of you and Michael . For years we leaned on tradition went about our work and reassured ourselves : The old ways are the safest ways , the surest ways . But we have been led down a path to ruin . Whole families lost to sickness or poison . The old ways are dead . The time has come to move on . To open ourselves to our new incarnation . Skeptics and outsiders have done their best to destroy us . And Anne has embraced them . Even laying with one of them . That 's not true . They misled my mother and Michael , but they shall not mislead us . Come , join me . Anne ? Anne . Your daughter has Michael 's gift for empty speech . Not only empty , but cruel . I 'm sorry she singled you out . It was unforgivable . - You don 't need to apologize for Amy . - Why not ? I 'm her mother . Her failure is my failure . That 's not true . You have to stop blaming yourself for everything that goes on here . I 've spent my life doing exactly what I 've been told . No one ever listened to me except when I repeated what Michael said . If I disagreed , I was yelled at . But I put up with it because I believed in him . Two days ago in the oubliette , you yelled at me . Anne , I 'm sorry . No , it 's fine . The point is , I yelled back . I felt safe with you . You were right , and you listened . You listened . The survivors of the thinning aren 't the only ones in need of a savior . What are you gonna do ? I 'm not going down without a fight . Amy may think she has control of the Abbey , but I have- - - Oh , my God . - What is it ? I haven 't had a chance to get up here since I was trapped . There must be a hundred new messages . They 're here . - They 're already here on the island . - Who 's here ? The answer to our problem . I thought you said this hike was an hour tops . An hour as the crow flies . We could 've taken the Ilaria chopper . Not without raising a dozen red flags . We need to get in , find Michael and the infertility biotech quickly and quietly . And what if Michael doesn 't want to cooperate ? Then we reason with him . I haven 't heard from Peter in five days . Who knows what we 're walking into ? I don 't want to use force unless it 's absolutely necessary . It might be . Dr. Jordan , I thought I might find you here . The curious scientist . Is this some kind of game to you , you crazy bitch ? Language . Do I need to have Landry wash your mouth out with soap ? You know , I am willing to give you a trade if you give me what I want . I can 't make you immortal . I 've never done the procedure . " Can 't " ? " Never " ? Those are self-defeating words . That 's just the kind of negative thinking that could lead to a terrible accident . Stop it . How long do you think the child could live outside the jar ? - What are you- - ? Don 't- - - Five minutes ? - Don 't . Stop it . - Two ? Okay , wait , wait . I 'll do it . Whatever you want . I thought you might see the light . Lieutenant commander , we found him . Oh , my God . You 're no doubt wondering how exactly our little organism survives . When Michael decided to raise children separately from their parents he naturally encountered resistance . So he tried separating babies and mothers pre-birth . But how to keep the babies alive ? Well , he devised a neutral environment , a synthetic womb in which babies could gestate without all those troublesome emotional attachments . You people are insane . And your opinion is noted . Anyway , it didn 't work . They lived a few weeks , which isn 't bad but ultimately a dead end . You see , he could only use the jar for a baby that never grew . One frozen in its development . As if it were immortal . Don 't . Don 't . Don 't do that . Look , I don 't care about you or your little tadpole . Tell me how you became an immortal . I was dying . And I received an infusion of spinal fluid from another immortal . - Sounds dangerous . - It can be . Especially if the fluid is from one of us . When I was a little , I used to watch my father standing here supervising his followers in the orchard . Even then I thought maybe one day I would take his place . And now I 'm here . But it 's not enough . I imagine there 's never enough for people like you . I want everything he had . His world and his eternity . Make me immortal and you will get your child back . So do we have a deal ? Good . We 'll do it today . I can 't do a spinal tap on myself . - Alan can do it later . - I 'm not waiting . Who do you expect to do the procedure ? You ? - Why not me ? - Because you 're not a doctor . If you make a mistake , you could leave me paralyzed . Please , just let me talk to Peter . Peter is off playing nursemaid to my poor mother . No . I want immortality today . It 's latched from the inside . No way to get through . Or over . Unless you want to get lit up like a Christmas tree . So you 're telling me there 's no way in . Could try knocking . Julia . - Sergio . - Don 't " Sergio " me . Why haven 't you returned my messages ? - It 's a long story . - Don 't have time for this . I need to talk to somebody named Michael . - He 's gone missing . - Then who 's in charge ? My name is Anne . You arrive at a time of some change . But you are welcome . Whoever took out our guy is gonna try again . Pick us off one at a time . Keep your head on a swivel . Teams of two , no wandering off . Yes , ma 'am . Listen up , teams of two . Fan out from here and sweep east . Seen this before . When we first arrived . Any idea what it means ? Trail marker , maybe ? Yeah , it 's a trail marker . You have a better theory ? Yeah , there are crazies out here saying : - " Go back wherever you came from . " - Can you two cut the chatter ? Form up , form up ! You heard the commander , form up ! Move , move ! Soren ? Jesus . Are you okay ? What happened to your eye ? - I 'm sorry , Dr. Kyle . - For what ? Are you aware of the Ilaria Corporation ? The name is unfamiliar to me . In four days , they 're going to launch a virus which will decimate a large percentage of the population . Up to five billion deaths . - Narvik ? - A new strain . Narvik-C . It 's self-replicating . It 'll spread in a matter of weeks , if not days . I don 't see how we can help . Please don 't waste my time . I know about Michael 's infertility experiments . I want the bio-tech . Why should I give it to you ? Ilaria 's unconcerned about how we slow population growth , just that it happens . - If I can show them another way- - - Using our infertility grafts ? Better that than slaughtering billions of people . - This is an outside world problem . - It 's a whole world problem . If they release the new Narvik , no one is safe . Not even on an island . I 'm asking for your help . There 's no need to lie . You 're not asking . Your man is prepared to shoot me if I refuse . Isn 't that right ? You don 't have it , do you ? - It 's in a safe place . - No . If you knew where it was , you 'd be taking bids . I know Anne . And I know this abbey . I can get you what you want . For a price ? What do you want , Peter ? Guaranteed immunity from Ilaria when all this is over . Done . And a finder 's fee . Nine figures . You want 100 million dollars ? To prevent five billion deaths , you 're getting a bargain . You 're a pig . And pigs get fed . There 's an indentation in between the third and fourth vertebrae . - Got it . - Angle the needle upward . Insert the needle , half an inch . Very slowly . I don 't know that I 'd let anyone do this to me without anesthesia . I can 't tell you what to do if I 'm taking a nap . Did I mention to do it slowly ? It 's not going in . The resistance is a membrane with fluid . Push a fraction of an inch . This part is crucial . Any further and you could damage my spinal cord . Nothing 's happening . - Take it out ! - What 's going on ? You missed . You 're in the nerve . You 're in the nerve tissue . - What should I do ? - Take it out , damn it ! You 'll have to start over again . You know , this isn 't easy for me either . Good . You 're awake . So we get to see those pretty eyes . - Where am I ? - You 're a guest in our home . See ? I even brought you supper . What we need on this island is salt . - Did you bring any salt ? - Sorry , fresh out . Try some . Smells great , but I 'm not hungry . I see . You 're too good to eat at my table ? Got one of the good bits . The eyes are the best part . Really , I couldn 't . Well , that 's it . I said I 'd look after you but if you 're gonna bad-mouth my cooking ... . What do you think you 're doing ? ! I was just looking at his eyes . You stay away from him . Look at you . You 're nowhere near ready . You 're skinnier than one of them island rabbits . - Nothing . - Trail 's gone cold . - Wait here . - What do you got ? - Any sign of Dr. Sommer ? - Trail disappears up the ridge . There 's no sign of anything within a quarter-mile radius . We 're going back to the Abbey . No . No . - We leave him out here , he 's dead . - He 's probably dead already . Look , Winger , we 're on the verge of finding a possible cure to maybe the world 's worst pathogen . I 'm not going back without it . The men assigned to my command are not special forces , but they 're men . That guy hanging in the tree was one of their own . Look , the only reason we were attacked is because we 're getting closer . I 'm sorry , but your man in the tree can 't get any more dead than he is . We keep searching . Jeez , that could 've left a mark . You 're still here ? Someone 's gotta knock some sense in that thick head of yours . Guess the big log didn 't do the trick . Do me a favor . If you have a point to make , make it . Don 't get all snippy on me . I 'm just wondering if you figured it out yet . - I 'm afraid to ask . - Then I 'll ask for you . What is it about this Kyle fellow that 's got you so hot under the collar ? Nothing , I told you . I 'm trying to stop Ilaria . Ilaria this , Ilaria that . You 're starting to sound like a broken record . What do you want from me , Doreen ? The truth , for starters . You and I both know saving the kid doesn 't amount to a hill of beans as far as Ilaria is concerned . If the shoe was on the other foot , he 'd be halfway back to Seattle by now . No . He believes in what he 's doing . - How 's that ? - He 's young . He 's reckless . But he 's not going through the motions . He really believes it . Now we 're getting somewhere . Doreen , you know exactly why I can 't leave Kyle out here . Yeah , well he 's as stubborn as you and doesn 't back down from a fight . He may even look a bit like you if you shave the damn beard . Oh , and you may want to take care of that head wound . They bleed like a son of a bitch . What head wound ? Hey . You still here , doc ? I think so . Lucky you 're still in one piece . What happened ? Booby trap . We are getting close . Closer than you think . I doubt the Mycotics are into Juicy Fruit . It worked . I did it . Now we transfer it to a clean syringe and when you 're ready , we reverse the procedure and inject it into your spine . What 's wrong ? This was what you wanted . I 'm not sure I trust you . - I trusted you . - What choice did you have ? I want my child back . I held up my end of the bargain . And I will hold up mine , as soon as I know you 're not going to try anything . You want immortality , this is the only way . Maybe we can try it on a rabbit . - A test . - It doesn 't work like that . I 'll do it . What ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm not . You can try it on me first . Why would you risk that ? She could be poisoning you . Then I 'll die . But I get to protect you , and if it works then I get to be immortal too . We could be together forever . Fine . Try it on him first . - That wasn 't part of the deal . - It is now . If you ever want to see your son again . Hey . Can I get a drink of water ? Look , I 'm sorry about the stew thing , but I 'm dying of thirst . Soren . I 'm sorry , Dr. Kyle . - For what ? - Tricking you into coming here . Well , you didn 't really trick me . Plus , the big guy did the heavy work anyway . - What you got there ? - It 's from the bleeding tree . - The bleeding tree ? - Yeah . We eat it so we don 't get more sick . Soren , do you know what Cadmus and Carol do ? You know how they get their food , right ? Yeah . They trap people . And eat them . That 's right . But I don 't want to be on the menu . If I help you , they 'll eat the rest of me . What do you mean , " eat the rest of you " ? Soren , listen I promise I won 't let them hurt you anymore . - You can 't . - No . I can 't while I 'm tied up here . - I need you to be brave . - No . - Please . - No . Soren , please . Hey . What 's going on here ? How many days before you can give the procedure to Amy ? Another three to four days before I can donate any more spinal fluid . You hear that , Amy ? I wish we could do it together , right now . Me too . But we 're going to be immortal together , so , what 's a few more days ? - What 's the holdup ? - I 'm waiting for the anesthetic to kick in . Get it over with . Unless you have some reason not to . Okay , you might feel a slight amount of pressure . I don 't feel any different . Help me . Hold him down . - What 's happening ? - I don 't know . I 've heard of patients who can reject a CSF infusion . I 've heard of doctors who poison patients . I didn 't do anything . Yes , you did . You just said goodbye to your baby . - What 's wrong ? - There are no seeds . - Of course not . - But we need seeds to plant trees . - That 's the point of this whole mission . - We don 't need seeds . We graft all our trees from the original rootstock . - We call her Mother . - Her ? Michael discovered Mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight . Only one tree survived absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it . Later , Michael discovered a curious effect in the fruit . It made the mortal men who ate it unable to father children . So all of this was created by accident ? Many of humanity 's greatest discoveries were accidental . Penicillin , quinine , insulin . - Why not Mother ? - I 'd like to see her . Of course . First you won 't eat my cooking then you want to leave without saying goodbye . Yeah , where are my manners ? You 're a funny one . Lucky , Caddie didn 't catch you first . Sometimes he lets the rabbits run just so he can have a good chase . Says it tenderizes the meat . Only trouble is , when he catches them he eats the eyes all to himself . But we 'll definitely be sharing yours . Blue 's my favorite color . Tastes great with honey . You eat the honey ? Of course we do . - Isn 't that dangerous ? - No . I keep a jar of it all to myself . Don 't tell Caddie . That 's- - That 's funny . He said the same thing about you . - What 's that ? - I probably shouldn 't say anything . Cadmus swore me to secrecy . He did , did he ? Cross my heart and hope to die . What 'd he say ? Don 't worry , you can trust me . I 'd like to , but you 've seen how Cadmus gets when he 's angry . I can get angry too . You tell me , little rabbit . All right , all right . But you gotta promise not to say anything . It 's just , he wants both of my eyes for himself . Son of a bitch , I knew it ! Please . Don 't tell him I told you . Some days , I think I could kill him . That 's a good idea . Then you could eat his eyes . What do you think we are , savages ? - We don 't eat our own . - Why not ? Because it 's wrong . And the disease makes the meat rotten . Everyone knows that . We 've taken extraordinary precautions where Mother is concerned . Nothing at the Abbey is more important . - No . - What 's wrong ? She 's gone . Mother is gone . All right . Come on , you can do this . Come on , come on . - No . - What 's this now ? What happened to you ? I can 't say . Come on , now . You tell me or I 'll give you something to bleed about . - Who did that ? - No . No . No , Carol will get angry . Carol . She knows better . She said she wanted them all to herself . - What are you talking about ? - My eyes . She wanted to take my eyes , but I wouldn 't let her . - She did what ? ! - Said she didn 't care what you thought . I told her you 'd get angry . She didn 't care . That bitch ! Never should 've left her with fresh meat ! Where the hell are you , woman ? What have I told you about ... . Quickly , woman . The meat 's gone ! Gonna get you ! Run , rabbit , run ! Useless rabbit . Share his eyes , Caddie . Share them . You 're gonna get it , rabbit . - Hello , rabbit . - Hold on . Hold on now . Share his eyes , Caddie . Share them . Enough , woman . You 're cooked . You all don 't eat your own , Carol told me . So what ? You 're clean . Not anymore . I ate all of it , now I 'm sick just like you . You just ruined my meal . Yeah , I 'm real sorry about that . Oh , you think you just saved yourself , do you ? No . No , no . Clear ! Check the perimeter ! See if there are any more of them ! - No more Mycotics . - Yes , sir . - Let 's go ! - Just the boy , Soren . - You hurt ? - I 'm all right . - For two more days , at least . - What are you talking about ? We 'd better find that damn tree , or I 'm a dead man .

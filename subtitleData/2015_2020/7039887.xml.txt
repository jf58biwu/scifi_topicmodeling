 JAMIE : Ten years ago , the animal population mutated , endangering human life on the planet . Our team managed to cure the animals , but at a terrible cost . In an attempt to return the planet to the animals , a secretive group called The Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity . And then , lab-made creatures ... Called hybrids ... Devastated the West Coast . So a massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America ... [ roaring ] but new breeds have started to appear , so we 're trying to reassemble our team . We battle on many fronts , searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids . The fight for mankind 's survival has just begun . - Previously on Zoo ... - It 's me , Clem . My father 's alive , and he needs you , Jamie . It 's Mitch Morgan . MYERS : You 're gonna be okay . There 's somebody here who 's been waiting to talk to you . It 's me , your daughter . Clementine . You have to stop . The last Shepherd that you chased - ended up dead . - What are you gonna do , arrest me ? I need to know what 's on that drive , ASAP . Somebody went through a lot of trouble to get that . [ explosion ] [ rhino roaring ] I 'm sorry . [ snorts ] Is that the IADG investigator ? Hey , excuse me , miss ? [ people screaming ] _ â™ª [ thunder rumbles ] Damn it . 96 people dead , 100 wounded . How could I let this happen ? You didn 't . This was not your fault . That woman , the bomber , we have to find her . We 've alerted the other safe zones . Yeah , well , what if it 's not about the safe zones ? She bombed us the same day that we found the new hybrid . That can 't be a coincidence . What are you saying , she targeted the hybrid ? I don 't know exactly , but there was this look in her eye . We have to find her . I 'll grab some extra ammo . For all we know , she 's over the mountains by now . Who knows who or what we 'll run into ? FIREFIGHTER : There 's more in the bullpen . - I need some help here . - You hurt ? No , I 'm fine . [ police radio crackles ] Danica . - You shouldn 't be in here . - I know . So who 's working on I.D. ' ing the ignition device ? Who isn 't ? We know that it was a hard drive inside the evidence room . We 're still running analytics , trying to identify this symbol . [ sighs ] Don 't waste your time . I know where the hard drive came from . [ phone ringing ] That 's where my dad 's supposed to be . [ computer trilling ] Siberia . After ten years of coming up empty , I 've learned not to get my hopes up . After so long , I 'd almost given up on finding you , but here you are . Are you feeling any better ? Oh , it 's okay . Dad , you don 't have to talk . Lieutenant Myers said that it might take some time . Where am I ? [ computer trilling ] Are you sure these coordinates are right ? Yes , I 'm sure . Where are you getting these images ? I had a friend re-task a Chinese satellite . You have friends who task Chinese satellites ? Clem , this place has been empty for decades . There 's no record of any traffic going in our out . How can you be so sure he 's here ? Let alone alive ? This is why . Where did you get this ? I have friends , too . How ? How did you find him ? I got a call from Lieutenant Myers . He told me an IADG survey team found a man in a stasis tank in an abandoned compound . A man that they believe to be my father . I thought it was a cruel joke until they showed me this picture . I thought you were dead . I don 't know how and I don 't know why , but my dad , he 's alive . Who else knows about this ? [ door opens ] MYERS : Hey . Has your father started talking yet , Clementine ? - A little bit , but ... - Did you ask him ? Not yet . We 'll get there . But right now , his brain 's gamma frequency readings are still low . How long ? Hours . Days . Look , we 're in uncharted territory here . No one 's ever been in stasis this long . Maybe we should just let him rest . [ scoffs ] Fine . But there 's a storm moving in , and I don 't plan on being here when it hits . Don 't mind him . - Stay . - Okay . Dad , I 'm here . _ _ Jackson Oz ? What 's he got to do with this ? You think he 's connected to the bomber ? Mm , no , no , no . I 'm , um , I 'm just ... Carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders again ? You act like all of this is somehow your fault . The spread of the the razorbacks ? The TX sterility ? I get why you want to track down Jackson as he and his crazy father are the bastards who started this all , but you can 't solve all the world 's problems . The Shepherd hunters will find Oz . They 'll make him pay . You , Dylan Green , are a wonderful , caring , passionate man . You have saved hundreds , if not thousands , of lives out here . And that 's enough . Do you believe me ? Yeah . Terrible liar , Dylan . Let 's go find your hybrid lady . - = Resync to WEBRip by Yn1D = - We now understand that the TX-gas has changed the neurons in the hypothalamus , prohibiting the production of the hormone essential for reproduction . BOARD MEMBER : With all due respect , Leanne , we are on the Titanic here and you are explaining the mechanics of how we are sinking . I understand your frustration , Cal , but we have made progress . Our latest synthetic hormone , FH-562 , was able to increase gonadotropin levels by 28 % in our test subjects . So , what does that mean ? Ovulation . Ovulation ? Now , unfortunately , the egg wasn 't viable , but even so , no one else has been able to achieve this feat . But our goal is not just ovulation . It 's to bring a child to term . The only way to make this happen is with your continued support . Give us a moment , please , Leanne . Mm-hmm . How 's it going ? Well , the fate of humanity rests on this self-important prick , God help us . Ah . [ taps remote ] So , what are you thinking , Cal ? You have our backing , Leanne . We will talk to the other board members . Fantastic . I 'll let the team know . Ovulation ? We 're nowhere near that milestone . All that matters is that Cal thinks we are . Well , then it 's good we have this . The NLRP2 protein . But I thought this wasn 't viable . We found another protein structure . The formula works . This is what we 've been waiting for . We can begin trials . Where did you get this ? One of our contacts , Jonah Sutton , got it from someone he used to work with at the University of Michigan , Dr. Abraham Kenyatta . Who ? You figure that thing out yet ? Not even close . Whatever Jackson encountered beyond the wall , it 's like nothing I 've ever seen . They could 've used our help , you know . You 're worried about Clem . If Mitch is really out there and there 's others looking for him ... [ sighs ] I know Jamie 's with her , but we 've had trai ... They are going to be fine . I feel sorry for anyone who 's unlucky enough to come between them and Mitch . I know , it 's just ... after all we 've been through together , riding the bench ain 't easy . We 're not riding the bench . We 're raising our son . [ scraping outside ] What was that ? It 's that tree out front . I really should cut it . [ both chuckle ] I know , I know . [ razorback snarls ] [ siren chirps ] Okay . Okay . Call me as soon as you have eyes on Campbell . Thank you . Still no sign of her ? [ sighs ] I 'll find her . Well , this should cheer you up . We ran some more tests . We were able to identify the accelerant . It 's a hyper-carbon , extremely powerful . These are initial results from the Portland bombing . - It 's the same hyper-carbon . - Yeah . Okay , so who 's running the case out in Portland ? No one . That 's hybrid territory . No agency is gonna send personnel that far past the barrier . But what about non-law enforcement ? We need somebody out there , we need a contact . We need somebody who knows the area . There 's an aid group out there . FEMALE VOICE : Both state and federal agents ... Wait , pause that . Go back one . Punch in on that . Unbelievable . [ siren wailing ] Hey , this is Detective Hale . Badge number 39374 . I need priority air transport . Where are you going ? Oregon . JACKSON : That 's her truck . She 's gone . Well , see if she left anything behind that might tell us where she went . Nothing . What is that ? I have no idea . Hello , Jackson . What 's going on ? Don 't worry , son . Why weren 't there any warnings about the hybrids ? Go , go . I know this is scary , but stay here and stay quiet and everything will be fine . Be brave for me ? Give Mommy a smile . Still no signal . Some kind of interference . So , we 're on our own . [ dog barking ] [ snarling outside ] [ electronic beeping ] What is that ? [ razorback growls , glass cracks ] Abe . We have to ... what ? [ electronic beeping ] The tissue sample , it 's grown into a fetus . Into a baby hybrid ? But how ? I don 't know . But this egg , I think it 's calling for help . [ dog barking ] The razorbacks have come for it . I 've seen this kind of long distance communication before in mutated lions , but that was nowhere near this powerful . [ razorbacks growling ] If that thing is what they want , I say let them have it . We can 't leave it here . This new hybrid has grown from a tissue sample into a fully-developed embryo in a matter of hours . If I can study it , somehow isolate the hormones responsible , this embryo could pave the way to reversing the effects of the TX-gas . You really playing the " we have to save the world " card again ? This could be the key to solving human sterilization . We cannot leave it behind . [ thunder rumbles ] Sounds like the storm 's moving and we got to work fast . I 'll lure them to the backyard . You take Isaac to the truck . I 'll meet you on the access road . No , no , Dariela . It 's too dangerous . There may be another way . [ grunts ] You must feel like Rip Van Winkle , waking up in a different world . Humanity sterilized . The West Coast fallen . Packs of monsters roaming the streets . But the IADG , they think that you can help . They think you know how to stop the hybrids . Do you remember anything about how you ended up in that tank ? Who put you there or why ? It 's okay . Just might take some time . 79 , 60 . 79 , 60 ? Seeing your face again , the only thing that I can remember is 79 , 60 . You don 't remember . The parking ticket I got the day you were born . $ 79.60 . Money well spent . Almost missed your birth . And I missed half your childhood . And the past ten years . I swear , I am ... I 'm not missing another second , ever . [ chuckles ] It 's good that you 're remembering . They need you to remember something , too . What do they want to know ? They 're looking for answers about some kind of program . Blue Diaspora . I don 't know what it means , but whatever it is , it 's really important . It 's the reason they came for you . We did everything we could to find her , Dylan . Okay , I don 't even know how we 're supposed to sleep with her still out there . [ sighs ] Well , we live in hybrid country , beyond the barrier . We 've seen our fair share of god-awful , horrible things . We 've helped hundreds of families find their way to safety , so I sleep fine at night , especially knowing you 're in bed beside me . [ knock on door ] Logan . It 's a nice place you got here ... Dylan . How we doing , Dr. Morgan ? His core temperature is coming up . MYERS : That 's great . Heart rate stabilized . Blood flow is improving . Well , how about your memory ? Anything coming back ? Yeah . I remember everything . Just waiting for you to upgrade me to a better room . [ chuckles ] Well , you got your sense of humor back . That 's a good sign . So then , tell me , what do you remember about Blue Diaspora ? I 'm sorry , I don 't know what that is . I understand . But my team tells me otherwise . What 's inside your head , it could help save a lot of people . How ? I 'm afraid that 's classified . But you get back to your old self , we get you IADG clearance , you can help us . Help the IADG ? Last I checked , you were trying to murder every animal on the planet , so , um ... no , thanks . I know your history with our organization , with General Davies , but that was ten years ago . I assure you , our priority now is protecting people from the hybrid threat . And that 's why we 're here . But we need your help . We need you to remember . I don 't know what to tell you . I 've tried . There 's nothing . That 's all right . Well , it looks like your gamma frequencies are still lagging behind . I got some meds that should be able to help with that . I 'll be right back . Whatever he gives you , don 't take it . Clem , what are you not telling me ? We need to get out of here . These are not good people , and they 're not with the IADG . Who are they ? They 're Shepherds . [ door opening ] Who are you ? Clementine . You shouldn 't be down here . What are you doing down here ? What am I doing down here ? What are you doing down here ? - Clem , take it easy . - Take it easy ? You have a man in a cage on your plane . He doesn 't deserve to be called a man , not after what he did . A little dramatic , don 't you think ? Shut up . His name is Greg Mansdale . He 's a Shepherd . For the last three months , he 's been giving me information , information I use against the other Shepherds . He 's one of the people who poisoned the planet , sterilized humanity . He 's one of the people who took Mitch from us . Do you know anything about my father ? You 're Mitch Morgan 's girl . Well , look at you all grown up . I said shut up . - [ stun gun zaps ] - [ grunts ] He doesn 't know what happened to your father , but he is going to help us find him . [ door buzzes ] This photo was taken yesterday , in Siberia . An abandoned Shepherd compound . Wait , Shepherds ... Jamie , how did you find ... This was taken today . Tell me what 's changed . [ stun gun zaps ] [ screaming ] Oh , okay , okay , okay , okay . [ panting ] Please . It 's a hangar . And that 's the shadow from the open hangar door . It means someone 's there already . But my dad . If it 's Shepherds and not the IADG ... Then we have to be ready for them . - [ stun gun zaps ] - [ screaming ] [ stun gun zapping ] Hello . My name is Leanne Ducovny . I 'm chief executive officer of Reiden Global . And let me start by saying thank you for taking the time to watch this video . Now , I 'm excited because Reiden Global has made a breakthrough that we believe , with your help , will put an end to the sterility pandemic . [ growls and barks ] [ barks ] You want to hurry it up , Abe ? This should block the signal . Like a Faraday cage . [ snarling ] [ dog barking ] Can we go now ? If this works . [ glass shattering ] [ whining ] [ razorback snarling ] [ barks ] Let 's go , let 's go . Isaac , come on . We have to hurry . Go . Go , go , go , go . You 're working with the Shepherds now ? Teaming up with them was the only chance I had at getting you back . I did what I had to . Why would they bring you along ? They knew that you would never trust them . They needed a familiar face . You know something . About Blue Diaspora . And they will do whatever it takes to get it out of you . [ alarm blares ] That 's the security system . Unknown aircraft coming on its final approach . They 're coming for Mitch . - Well , go take care of it ! - Yes , sir . Let 's go , let 's go . I don 't know what that is , but this seems like a good time to get out of here . - Let 's go . - All right . - [ Mitch grunts ] - Oh . How are you a cop ? It 's been years ... Dylan . A lot can change . Tessa seems nice . You so much as breathe a word to her about me , - I swear I will ... - Easy , easy , easy . If you want to call yourself Dylan and play hero in the badlands , be my guest , okay ? I 'm not here to change that . But as somebody who knows a thing or two about lying to the person that you love , the sooner that you come clean , the better . [ Tessa approaching ] What 'd I miss ? Thank you . Dylan was just saying how lucky he is to have you . Is that so ? You came an awful long way to hear about our love life . Look , I want what you want . To find the person who bombed my precinct and your camp . The woman you 're looking for is mid to late 30s . Brown hair , dark skin , about five-seven . - You 've seen her ? - TESSA : Just for a second . We tracked her and found her truck , but it was a dead end . She left this behind . Have you found anything else with this symbol on it ? No . Okay . I 'm gonna need to see where you found this . - If we leave right now ... - There is no " we , " Detective , okay ? So if you don 't mind , I have people back at camp that need my help . Look , I don 't know what the deal is with you two , but it sounds complicated . And Dylan 's probably the most uncomplicated guy I know . Well , you just ... you don 't know Dylan the way that I do . SOLDIER : We 've boarded the plane . Moving in . â™ª Mansdale ? Run . [ gun cocks ] [ men grunting ] CLEMENTINE : This isn 't going to work , you can barely stand . We have to try . Oh , is that right ? - Please . We were just ... - Shut up ! You ... sit down . No . - I said sit ... down . - No . He doesn 't know any ... ah ! [ groaning ] : Ow , ow . Well , maybe he just needs a little motivation . No , no , no , no ! Hold this . Let 's give Daddy some space . Come on . [ razorbacks snarling ] There 's two outside by the ... ABRAHAM : Isaac , don 't move . Everyone stand still . [ whispers ] : Why isn 't it attacking ? It 's looking for the egg . Then that 's give it to him . ABRAHAM : It 's too important . It won 't matter if we don 't make it out of here alive . - [ growls ] - [ gasps ] [ yells ] - Daddy ! Daddy ! - Abe ! Abe ! Daddy ! [ growling and snarling ] [ Abraham coughs ] Daddy , are you okay ? Yeah . [ gasps ] I 'm okay , Isaac . JACKSON : Keep your leg elevated . All right ? Just take it easy . Someone 's calling for you . MAN : Help with that one . This is Dylan . Dylan . You look more like a Jackson to me . Who is this ? It 's me , Jackson . You , your lions and that adorable little girlfriend of yours have been chasing after me . You have something of mine . The disc . Consider it a gift . So you 'll remember me when your world crumbles around you . Who do you think you are ? 96 people are dead because of you . You understand that ? - Why ? - I always imagined you were smarter than you appeared . Who are you ? You destroyed my world once . Now it 's my turn . Yeah , well , let me tell you something , okay ? You have no idea who you 're up against . [ line clicks ] [ shouting ] DALLAS : You give me Blue Diaspora , I give you your daughter . Easy . But if you keep on playing dumb , you are gonna wish - you never woke up . - No ! Aah ! Dad , please , tell him ! Dad , please ! Look , I-I ... I told you . I don 't know what that is . - You 're a liar ! - Dad , tell him ! I 'm not lying , I don 't know what that is . I don 't know how to help you . Look , I will do anything you want , just , d-don 't hurt her . - Do you love your daughter ? - Don 't hurt her ! Do you want to see your daughter alive ? ! - Don 't hurt her . - Help me ! - I can 't help you ! - Two ! - Don 't , don 't , don 't ! - One . Don 't . [ wire zapping ] - You okay ? - Yeah . I 'm fine , I think . You know how to use that ? Do you ? Stop . Dad ? - Dad , is that really you ? - Who the hell are you ? It 's okay , I 'm , I 'm his daughter , Clementine . You are not Clementine . I am . - What ? - Don 't listen to her . - Let 's shoot her and let 's get out of here . - What ? Dad , I came here to save you . - Don 't call me that . - Dad . - We need to get out of here . - You either ! Dad , I know this is hard to understand right now . - Stop talking . - Don 't listen to her . Stop talking , both of you , stop talking . - Don 't do it , Dad . - Shut up . Shut up ! Why don 't we all just take a breath , and put the guns away . You first . See ? No gun . Now I 'm gonna reach into my pocket , - Dad . No . No . - I can prove - I 'm your daughter . - Keep your hand out ... Stay the hell out of this . No , Dad ! [ drops gun ] My parking ticket . - Dad . - [ gun clatters ] I didn 't know you had it in you . Who are you ? You 're gonna tell me everything about Blue Diaspora . Let 's go . [ gunshots ] Are you okay ? Nice beard . JACKSON : She called me . That bitch called me . Who called you ? The bomber . What did she say ? Well , she knew my name . She was taunting me . Like it was personal . Because it is . I I.D. ' ed the bomber with , uh , with DNA off of that disc that you guys found . Her name is Abigail Westbrook . This is her genetic profile . Okay . When I got the preliminary results , I just assumed you must 've somehow contaminated the sample . So I had my tech run the tests again , but the results , - the exact same . - What are you saying ? You and this Abigail Westbrook share multiple genetic markers . That 's why I thought it was contaminated , but it wasn 't . Jackson , Abigail Westbrook is your sister . CLEMENTINE : You sure you know what you 're doing ? The bullet passed clean through . So I 'll have to watch it for infection , but you 're gonna be fine . Well , if you 're looking for a second opinion , I can take a look . How you feeling ? Like I shot my daughter . I see it , now . I couldn 't see it before , I 'm sorry . What ? You . Given the circumstances , I think I 'll let it slide . Maybe these will help . Um , I 'll leave you two alone . Wait , Clem . Don 't worry , Dad . Not going anywhere . So ... how did you end up with the plane ? [ laughs softly ] Well , we saved the world on this thing , I thought I should keep it in the family . What happened ? Last thing I remember is , uh , teeth and claws , ripping into me . Whoever saved my life , they ... They didn 't do it out of the kindness of their hearts . You were in Siberia . At the edge of the world . Whoever put you in that tank , they didn 't want anybody to find you . They kept you away from me ... from the world , for ten years . I 'm going to find out who did this . I 'm gonna find out why . I 'm gonna make them pay . Finally got him to fall asleep . He 's afraid the razorbacks will get him while he 's sleeping . The world 's become a dangerous place . So many things we have to protect him from . We got lucky today . Looking back , maybe we should 've gone with Clementine . [ both laugh ] [ knock on door ] Sorry to disturb you , sir . Can we come in ? Sure . You all right ? We had a hybrid incident . We 'll alert IADG . But that 's not why we 're here . My kid 's sleeping . Mind if we talk in the kitchen ? - Yes , ma 'am . - It 's this way . If this isn 't about the hybrids , why are you here ? An emergency government protocol has been initiated in the tri-county area . What protocol ? We have an introductory video that explains it better than I could . Hello . My name is Leanne Ducovny . I 'm chief executive officer at Reiden Global . And let me start by saying thank you for watching this video . I 'm excited to tell you that Reiden Global has made a breakthrough , that we believe , with your help , will put an end to the sterility pandemic . - But sacrifices ... - What ? Will need to be made for the greater good . Which is the reason that I 'm addressing you . Your child has been selected to participate in our pilot program . He or she will be safe in our custody . Isaac ! - Ma 'am ... - Hey , hey ! [ yells ] Isaac ! - Isaac ! - Isaac ! [ slow motion ] : Isaac ! â™ª [ slow motion ] : Mommy ! Daddy ! Please , God , please .

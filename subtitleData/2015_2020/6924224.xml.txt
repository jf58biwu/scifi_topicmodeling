 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Nobody seems to know where Simmons is . You have to leave now . It 's a top-secret assignment . If this book is as powerful as everyone thinks it is , then hiding it somewhere safe is our top priority . There are consequences for playing God . Me ? Your uncle is the one who wants to play god . - [ Alarm blaring ] - No . [ Energy humming ] [ Screams ] What happened ? I expected a crater . No explosion . The room seems stable . Was it some kind of energy weapon ? This all feels wrong . No Fitz , either . I don 't get it . There should be some sign of them . It 's like they vanished . Coulson , Fitz , report in . [ Static crackles ] Man : Alpha Team , do you read ? We 've got movement . Eli Morrow is in the South Corridor . Eli . Let 's see what he knows . Mr. Morrow ... we 're here to escort you out of here . - He 's armed ! - [ Weapons cocks ] [ Sighs ] Beautiful , no ? Pure carbon . Sir , you have to put down the weapon . We 're into nightmare territory here . This is evil . This is ... It 's Eli . This is a tragedy . We have to prepare for the likelihood ... Whatever you 're gonna say , don 't . I see the way you 're all looking at that screen . We don 't know what happened . - Daisy . - It 's okay . This is a process . No , it 's S.H.I.E.L.D. Impossible things happen all the time . That ... That machine ghosted that Lucy woman . So what ... Coulson and Fitz come back in five years , bloody and insane ? I don 't know . That 's my point . They could be stuck in one of those boxes or ... Or maybe they 're gone . M ... May . I know it 's crazy , but Coulson came back from the dead , Fitz pulled Simmons through space through a rock , and Robbie 's head lights on fire . Simmons . We need to approach this with level heads . No , we need to call Simmons . She can solve this , if anyone can . And she deserves to know . Okay . But why did Eli turn on us ? What does he want ? What he wanted all along a power . I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew to steal the box in the first place . We need to take him off the street now . No . Daisy 's right . Simmons needs to study this tech first , see what makes Eli tick . He 'll kill again , sir . Eli killed four agents with his mind . Go after him now , and you 'll make it five . Those agents died for no reason . And , hopefully , Simmons will give us a way to avenge them . And if we 're really , really lucky , maybe she 'll find hope for saving our friends . I 'll call her now . Mace . When you talk to her ... I know what Agent Fitz means to her . Dr. Simmons , we need your help . Simmons : Is that a Terrigenesis cocoon ? In progress ? Oh . It 's incredibly rare to see the actual metamorphosis . It only lasts a few fleeting moments . Man : Not this one . The subject 's been gestating for seven months . Come again ? How has he survived ? Who is he ? Classified . Agent Simmons , we 're not worried about who he was . We want to know what he 'll become . I know you 're not okay , but ... you okay ? [ Sighs ] What if Daisy was right and they 're not dead ? Where 's this coming from ? I have a feeling ... Can 't explain . I know you 're hurting , but Coulson was clear ... Do not open that book . - He didn 't know what was inside it . - He knew enough . It 's Pandora 's Box , and you don 't know the consequences . Neither do you . This might be our only shot at saving them . Melinda , don 't you dare . Mace : You wanted to speak ? Yes , sir , I , uh ... I think I 've found a workable lead to track down Eli Morrow , from one of May 's better ideas . Then let 's hear it . Remember the head of the Chinatown Crew that ordered the heist of these boxes ... Chen ? He got infected by Lucy , went through the same thing I did . Until his brains hemorrhaged all over the lab . Well , before that , he spent two years in South Ridge Penitentiary . With Mr. Morrow . Exactly . The Chinatown Crew was working with Eli when he was in prison . And now that he 's out , they might know his location . Now , I figure , if I find their hideouts , I find Eli , - and then I can ... - Slow down . We 're not gonna just go cracking heads . It 's not cracking heads . Let him go . Someone should . - Look , my job is to keep people safe . - Mine , too . So , first we sharpen the ax , and then we chop the tree . My ax is plenty sharp ... And a shotgun . We 'll follow your leads in due time , after we study this tech . The Zephyr is wheels up in five . Agent Mackenzie , there are four fallen agents who need to be prepped for their ... For their last ride home . Yes , sir . You and I will ride ahead in the Quinjet , get this cargo back to base , max speed . Dr. Radcliffe will work on them immediately . Simmons approved it ? I talked to her . It 'll take her a few hours to return . So , this way , we don 't waste any time . They were my closest family , and I didn 't know them at all . They both ... I knew Robbie was disturbed , but ... But I was afraid that was ' cause of me ... 'cause I was holding him back . No , you ... you were what he held onto . You grounded him . But I wanted him to leave ... You know , figure himself out . I didn 't know that was what he was up against . Your brother loves you more than anything . I just wish we had talked . You really think he 's not gone ? I know the feeling when someone 's gone , and I don 't feel that now . [ Clicks tongue , chuckles ] Plus , your brother 's pretty damn stubborn . [ Both chuckle ] You have no idea . If he is out there , he 's gonna go straight for Uncle Eli . [ Machinery whirring ] And he 'd be doing the right thing . [ Engine starts ] Mack , what are you doing ? Sir , you got to stop . Director 's orders ... We 're about to take off any minute . [ Grunts ] Hey ! What 's gotten into you ? ! [ Tires squeal ] Mack ! [ Panting ] Sir ? ! Yeah . - You okay ? - Yeah . Where 's Eli ? I don 't know . What happened ? Eli locked himself inside , triggered the device , then everything just went white . Yeah , I got hit with the same blast . You know what it was ? Best bet is this chamber 's some kind of of particle generator . I think we got hit with the fallout when Eli blasted himself . I feel okay . Was it radiation ? No . I think we got lucky . I 'd like to find Eli and ask him myself . May : What happened ? I expected a crater . Thank God . No explosion . Yeah , well , I was pretty psyched about that . Eli triggered the Silo right in front of me . The room seems stable . Was it some kind of energy weapon ? No , it 's not a weapon , 'cause Eli used it on himself . This all feels wrong . He got the knowledge from the Darkhold . We need to grab him . Do you think he was trying to enhance himself ? No Fitz , either . - What ? - What ? - I don 't get it . - May , what are you ... May : There should be some sign of them . It 's like they vanished . Mack ... Mack . [ Snaps fingers ] Hey ! Big man , over here ! Over here ! Hey ! May : Coulson , Fitz , report in . Yeah ! Report ! I 'm reporting ! - May , I 'm right here ! - Reporting ! [ Sighs ] The blast must have altered our state somehow . You think ? Wait . What are they doing ? Do we look that stupid on comms ? Eli . Let 's see what he knows . We can 't lose them . Fitz , come on ! I heard some troubling things from Lucy . You try to kill them ? You were behind this the whole time ! Mr. Morrow ... we 're here to escort you out of here . What did you do ? He 's armed ! [ Weapons cocks ] Tío , keep your head , man . Don 't do anything stupid . It 's beautiful , no ? Pure carbon . Sir , you have to put down the weapon . Tío , don 't hurt them . Get away from him ! - [ Bodies thud ] - [ Gasps ] I 'm sorry . I couldn 't help them . We 're into nightmare territory here . You can 't hear me , can you ? This is evil . This is ... It 's Eli . I couldn 't stop him . It 's not your fault . You can see me ? Yeah , Robbie . We see you . What did he do to us ? I hate watching my own demise . This is a tragedy . I don 't think we 're dead . I feel sick . My stomach hurts . [ Grunts ] And the lights are darker , right ? The lights . Yeah . Their voices are hard to hear . They can 't penetrate wherever we are . What do you mean " where we are " ? Do you understand what this is ? I think I understand why Lucy and her friends looked like ghosts now . They were out of phase with our reality . It 's like the ... The invisible quantum mechanics inside the boxes , moving in and out of our dimension . Lucy and her friends were stuck in between , and now we are , too . Trapped between dimensions ? Yeah , that shock wave ... That wasn 't turbulence ... That was ... that was ... friction between two dimensions . Dude . What ? Okay , imagine the world is a ... Is a raft floating on water , and Eli punches a hole right at our feet . We 're getting sucked down into ... who knows what ? - Or maybe they 're gone . - May . Plus , we 've been pulled further than Lucy ever was . We can 't affect them , or even our own environment . And wherever we are , they think we 're dead . Well , we may well be soon . - Simmons . - Thank you , finally . They 're gonna tell her I 'm dead . I 've got to phone her , let her know that I 'm in another dimension . That 's not gonna work . [ Cellphone thumps ] Oh , what 's she gonna think ? Fitz , we 're gonna find our way home . Focus on that . We 're gonna figure this out . Yeah , okay , well , we better do it fast , 'cause whatever water we 're treading , we 're sinking . - I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew ... - The Chinatown Crew . - To steal the box in the first place . - I think they 're right about that . I can help find them . They 'll need to know we 're alive first . You got any hell-demon tricks up your sleeve ? No . He 's fighting me right now . Then we 'll stick together , and we 'll find a way to make them hear us ... All of us . I 'll call her now . Mace . When you talk to her ... I know what Agent Fitz means to her . Fitz . Were you able to get Simmons on the line ? They confiscated her phone . But I do have Senator Nadeer on the line , sir . Yo , Fitz , you 're a doctor , right ? Uh , not exactly . Hold on . They wouldn 't let us talk to her ? They 're dealing with the Senator that hates Inhumans . How the hell did Simmons get mixed up with all this ? Senator , thank you for taking my call . Yes , we have a crisis brewing , and I know we had an arrangement , but , uh , I need Simmons to return immediately . Ellen , you have generously kept this situation quiet , and I thank you , but we 're past that now . I need Simmons back . Lives are on the line . Wait . What do you mean ? Where is she ? [ Line clicks ] What situation ? What have you done ? She hung up . Tell me you put a tracker on Simmons or something . We didn 't know we 'd need one . Damn it . - Cold . - Yeah . - Keep working Nadeer 's people . - Yeah , it 's cold and heartless . I swear , if I get out of here , I 'm gonna knock him stupid . No . I cold . What ? I 'm freezing . [ Grunts ] What happened ? I don 't know . I need sunlight ... warmth , anything . I 'm dying here . - [ Grunting ] - Okay , okay . - Okay , let 's get you warm . - [ Shivering ] Coulson : May , I need you to hear me . I 'm not gone ! May , help ! Ahh . May : You 're not allowed to be gone ... Not yet . No , I haven 't gone anywhere . You 're not dead . [ Sighs ] After the Glasgow Assignment , we promised that we would open that bottle of Haig if we ever had a worse job . We 've had 10 by now . I think Fury would rather have had us die than give up that bottle . [ Sighs ] What the hell are we waiting for ? Hey . I 'm here . May , I 'm right here . You can do this . Hear me , please . Yes . It 's me , May . I 'm right here . The Darkhold . No . No , no , no . That 's not how we solve this . May . No . I know you 're not okay , but ... you okay ? What if Daisy was right and they 're not dead ? Mack , do not let her open that book . Where 's this coming from ? I have a feeling ... Can 't explain . I know you 're hurting , but Coulson was clear ... Do not open that book . Thank you . Someone listens . - He didn 't know what was inside it . - He knew enough . It 's Pandora 's Box , and you don 't know the consequences . Really ? You 're not hearing this ? Neither do you . This might be our only shot at saving them . - Don 't you dare . - [ Screaming ] What happened ? I don 't know . He just doubled over . There 's nothing I can do about it . We 're being dragged down . He doesn 't want to go . He won 't go . But I wanted him to leave ... You know , figure himself out . No ! He won 't go ! I didn 't know that was what he was up against . Who won 't go ? [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] It 's ... It 's gone . What do you mean ? Where did it go ? Gabe : He 's gonna go straight for Uncle Eli . [ Machinery whirring ] And he 'd be doing the right thing . Daisy : Mack , what are you doing ? Sir , you got to stop . Director 's orders ... We 're about to take off any minute . [ Grunts ] Hey , what 's gotten into you ? [ Tires squeal ] Mack ! Did what I think just happened just happen ? He 's going after the Chinatown Crew . Tell May what happened . And if we ever get the chance , never tell your brother about this next part . Oh , no , we 're way past that . Wait . What are you thinking ? Don 't go . If I 'm being dragged down to hell , this might be my chance to take Eli with me . Sorry , Coulson . [ Keys jingling ] [ Engine starts ] [ Tires squeal ] What 's going on ? Oh , nothing . Just Mack 's the Ghost Rider now , but you can 't hear us , so ... bloody hell . [ Tires screech ] Pull over ! What are you doing ? ! What needs to be done ! Don 't get in my way ! Damn it , Mack . [ Tires squeal ] It heals itself . Scientifically impossible self-healing car . [ Tires squeal ] [ Tires screech ] [ Horns honking ] This isn 't over . [ Tires squeal ] Mace : They 're out of their minds . They are out of their minds . Driving off against orders ... With no helmet ? Mack knows better . Daisy will bring him in quietly . See the younger Reyes boy gets some counseling . Dr. Radcliffe , thank you for coming on such a terrible day . Now , Fitz , we can 't ... [ Sighs ] You 've met my assistant , of course ... Aida . We 're devastated by what 's happened to Fitz and the team . We 've gotten to work straight away . - Good . Any progress ? - Sort of . These boxes look empty , but they 're not . They harness energy from multiple dimensions . Well , theoretically , could be used to manipulate matter states , transfer dimensional energy , but practically , it 's light-years beyond me . We will , of course , keep working . We know , Doctor . The people who constructed these boxes used this . [ Bag unzipping ] - A book . - Great . Comes with an instruction manual and everything . Well , please , get back to work . If you 'll excuse me , we 've had some casualties , and I need to inform their families . Help me out here . A manual ? Uh , you ... What 's your name ? Nathanson , ma 'am . What can I do ? Get lost , Nathanson . [ Sighs ] I don 't know what it is . It 's supposed to have answers . I don 't know . But it worried Coulson in a way I 've rarely seen . [ Sighs ] Very well . [ Latch clicks ] Let 's see what you are . [ Dramatic music plays ] What the hell is that ? Y-you have to read it . You 're the only one who can understand the science . - No , there has to be another way . - There isn 't . If you won 't read it , I will . Listen , if I had 10 years , maybe I could understand it , but ... it 's too much for a human mind to bear . You want to tell that to Simmons ? I don 't . [ Whirs , beeping ] [ Rapid , rhythmic thumping ] Listen to that ... the heartbeat , and it 's fast ... 130 BPM . He 's nervous . Lower the lights . Clear the room . What ? We can 't do that . You will do that , because , despite the lack of respect I 've been shown today , I assume I was brought here because your bosses value my expertise . So impress them by keeping me happy . Everyone out ... now . [ Air hisses ] Hi . I 'm Jemma Simmons . I 'm from S.H.I.E.L.D. And I 'm here to help you . I know this is all frightening , but I have friends who have also gone through this . [ Thumping slows ] But it 's okay . I 'm here , and we 'll get through this together . [ Cracking ] [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Breathing rapidly ] I 'd like a word . Radcliffe : May . May , this is lunacy . If the Internet is a garden hose , this book is Niagara Falls , blasting the universe 's deepest thoughts through your eyeballs . It 's a piece of technology , a tool . So 's a grenade , until it 's in the hands of a child . You can 't handle it . You 'll hurt yourself . Perhaps I could read the book . Absolutely not . No , no . What 's going on ? Aspirations of a do-gooder . So ? She 's a scientist and braver than you , apparently . Here 's the thing ... Aida 's not exactly my assistant . Or human . What ? She 's an android . So she is my assistant , but ... she plugs into the wall . So it 's like you say ... She 's a tool . No offense , Aida . None taken . I was designed to save lives , to be the shield . Shush ! You 're developing a catchphrase . May , I can assure you she 's as aboveboard as a ... secret android could be . Fitz-Simmons helped . Then use her . What ? But ... do you think that 's a good idea ? You said I can get hurt . Can she ? Only rebooted . If her files get corrupted ... She 's a computer . Perfect . Then it 's just a download . She 's the tech we need to save them . [ Tires screech ] Well , this looks like the place . [ Tires screeching ] [ Tires screech ] Mack : It 's not ideal , but Mack ... he has a lot of pain . He lost hope . I could survive off his pain for years . I know where you 're being dragged down to . I 've escaped it before . Mack ... You need to come with me . I 'm never going back . Please be careful with my baby . [ Tires squeal ] No , no . No , no . It heals itself . Scientifically impossible self-healing car . That only works when I 'm the Rider . [ Tires squeal ] [ Horns honking , tires screech ] You 're gonna let that stop you ? Daisy , we have to catch him , okay ? Mack can 't control that thing . This isn 't over . [ Tires squeal ] Attagirl . That 's more like it . [ Tires squeal ] Move , move . - [ Horn honks ] - Damn it ! [ Sighs ] I 'm running out of time . [ Cellphone beeps ] The Chinatown guys have a warehouse not far from here . [ Police radio chatter ] Just go left , Daisy . Daisy , go left ! Turn left ! Turn left ! [ Breathing deeply ] [ Turn signal clicking ] Robbie ? Oh , I love this car . Now go ! Go ! [ Tires screech ] I think you were right about us being pulled to the other side . The darkness is closing in around us . Why did he stop reading the book ? - You have to read it . - Because he 's smart . That book is too dangerous to use . It should be locked up or burnt . Oh , come on ! That 's defeatist . Excuse me ? It 's surrender . It 's a death sentence . I 'm not gonna do it to Simmons . Science can solve this . Science can solve this . Human mind . Oh , I am so thick . Aida . Aida , read the book . What are you doing ? She can process it better than anyone . Aida . [ Claps hands ] Listen to me . Listen to me . Just understand what I 'm saying , please . They can 't hear me . Maybe you can . Fitz , Radcliffe just said it himself ... The human brain can 't handle that book . Yeah , well , she 's not human . Aida , the book . Read the book . Read the book ! [ Sighs ] Perhaps I could read the book . Huh . I 'm sorry . What did you mean ... " not human " ? Because Radcliffe and I built her , okay ? Her mind can 't be corrupted because it 's just programming . She 's a perfect fit . She 's a robot ? An android . She can handle a quadrillion functions per second , and she can get us home . Fitz , that was not your call to make . Absolutely , it is . Whose is it ? It 's not yours . You 're not the director anymore . I have just as much say in this as you do . What are you so angry about ? Because you used to make decisions like that all the time , and then you stepped down . I did what was best for S.H.I.E.L.D. Everybody is trying to do their best to prevent another tragedy ... like Lincoln . For you and Daisy , that meant throwing in the towel , but we built Aida to protect agents like him . I didn 't throw in the towel . I ran an illegal spy agency using powered operatives on American soil . Do you think the President loved that about me ? I had to step down so that you could all continue in S.H.I.E.L.D. You handed it over to a director who betrayed Simmons ! He sent her off , God knows where ! [ Breathing heavily ] We were having an argument . [ Voice breaking ] Now she 's out there , alone , and I 'm gone . Listen to me . He would never hurt her . Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're gonna make sure of that . [ Sniffles ] All right , well , I need you in this fight , 'cause I got to get back to her . I 'm in this fight . [ Sighs ] I hope I 've done the right thing . The pages are blank . [ Dramatic music plays ] Not to her . [ Gasps ] Thank you . Thank you . It 's nice to meet you , Jemma ... Simmons . Yeah , of course . What 's your name ? Aah ! Aah ! Thank you , Doctor . I think we 're finished here . Jemma . On your left . [ Tires screech ] Fair enough . I can 't help you . Have fun . Please . I already told you where he is . What else do you want from me ? I want you to pay ... with your life . Hey ! Mack . No . You 're smarter than that . You . I 've been a voice in your head all these years . Now , finally , we get to speak face-to-face . I 've wanted you gone . But our work isn 't done . Eli is out there . We need to stop him . " We " ? There is no we . Your time is over . No , no , no . Please , don 't kill me ! Stay . We had a deal . You still owe me vengeance . Your neighborhood is soaked in the blood I spilled for you . None of that matters if I don 't take down the monster behind all of this ... Eli . He 's my blood . He will meet me , too . It 's getting darker , like it 's pulling us down . All right , guys , we can finish the assembly from here . Clear this part of the building . [ Radcliffe sighs ] Alternating probe and coupling lasers , built exactly to your specifications at 593.5 nanometers . [ Energy pulsing ] I 'm building an inter-dimensional gateway with an android I 've created . If this works , I could die happy . May : We 've put our faith in a robot who says she hears ghosts . If it fails , you might die quickly . They 're here . I promise . How is she doing that ? I 'm not even gonna pretend to know . May , I really wish you could see this . Coulson , watch out ! [ Grunting ] Come on ! Fight ! You got to fight ! I 'm pulling ! [ Grunts ] We 're running out of time ! [ Grunting ] Is she doing anything ? I hope so . We 're running out of time . You can 't hold on to Mack 's body forever . He 's a good man . He doesn 't have vengeance in him . It 's not ideal , but Mack ... He has a lot of pain . - [ Groaning ] - He lost hope . I could survive off his pain for years . I know where you 're being dragged down to . I 've escaped it before . Mack ? You need to come with me . I 'm never going back . Mack , don 't do this . That 's not you . You got to fight it . We made a deal . I ain 't going nowhere . Ready , Aida ? [ Energy crackling ] No , they 're in trouble ! No ! That would be a deadly mistake . [ Breathing quickly ] [ Both grunting ] Hold on , Phil ! [ Both grunting ] Come on ! [ Grunts ] Fight it ! That 's it ! Fight ! Let 's go home . [ Both grunting ] We did it , Fitz ! We did it ! We did it , Fitz ! We did it . Thank you . I knew you weren 't gone . [ Panting ] I know . You 're right . I won 't survive this without you , but the truth is , you need me , too . We had a deal ! How about a new one ? Give me my vengeance on Eli . Settle my score , and I 'll settle yours ... All of yours ! Mack ? What happened ? Robbie , that ... that thing ... He took it out of me . Are you all right ? Some of those things you said ... you ... You said you were in pain . No , it 's just a rough day . I 'm okay . Good . Where 'd he take it ? Hell . Mace ... where is he ? Mace ! I know what you did . Where the hell 's Simmons ? Agent Fitz , it 's good to see you back . Simmons will be here in a moment . Yeah , well , I 've heard that line before . I want to know where she 's coming from 'cause I heard you on the ... - Fitz ... where is he ? - Jemma ? What ? Fitz ! Jemma . [ Both breathing deeply ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] So , Aida ... I know what you 're gonna say . I know you don 't approve . Not my call . But you promised you wouldn 't open the Darkhold . You broke that promise . Damn straight . You know , when this is over you and I have a bottle of Haig to open . [ Footsteps approaching ] Mack is still upstairs . I think he needs some time alone . Is he okay ? Don 't know . Bad day . And Robbie ? He pulled the Rider out of Mack , but he 's gone , I think . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well , what he did should count for something . Mack got a lead on his uncle ... Possible location . We 'll follow it up , make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone else . Good . [ Flames roar ] [ Robbie screaming ] I thought I 'd be seeing you . And I know you 're not alone . Want to help settle my last score ? We 'll return in a moment . ? I saved the day ? ? I saved the day ? ? Don 't be dismayed ? ? The friends we made ? ? I finally made ... Aida ? ? The friends we made ? [ Sighs ] ? Don 't be dismayed ? No , I 've said that already . Uh , what else rhymes with " Aida " ? ? She 's not a grenade ? No . Ugh ! Aida , what else rhymes with " Aida " ? Huh ? Parade ... Oh , never mind . [ Chuckles ] ? I saved the day ?

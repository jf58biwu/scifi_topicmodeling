I think I just like saying " intake manifold . " Maybe when I get a job , I 'll get Triple A. I thought you worked at the water company . Temping . - How 's your parents ? - They 're doing okay . I should , um , get going , actually , for dinner . But , um , we should make a plan . I 'll send you a text . Or we could do that now since we 're both here . - What ? - Nothing . [ Chuckles ] Okay . [ car door slams ] [ " Something Old Something New " playing ] [ man ] Nice of Mercer . I always thought you two would make a good ... - Mom . - Couple .

Oh , they won 't cover the cost of IGIV . It 's $ 40,000 . So , you know , surprise , surprise . It 's not on their list . [ Dad ] Oh , enough of all that .

Those guys did not screw around , but listen , I got you an interview . - What ? - I got you an interview tomorrow . - [ screams ] - [ laughing ] Yes , I did . Really ? No . [ laughing ] Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , I did , tomorrow . Holy shit , Annie , I love you . [ Annie ] Remember , it 's just customer experience . So answer phones , help people , what you 're already doing but now a real company . I know , it 's perfect . Tons of people started there . [ Mae ] I know , I know . Thank you . Stop saying that . We 're hiring a hundred people this month . - One of them may as well be you . - Right , good . This doesn 't mean you 're in . You have to kill the interview . Know the Circle inside out . I 'm back next week . By then , you 'll be hired if you kill the interview . [ Mae ] Okay , I will . [ Annie ] You can do it , Mae . Own it ! [ indistinct chattering ] [ man ] How would you describe what the Circle is to say , - your grandmother ? - Take True You , for example . It combined everything that was separate and sloppy into one account . No more forgetting your password , multiple identities , identity theft . You use your real name , which is tied to your credit card . I think Grandma 's falling asleep . [ scoffs ] Okay . Before True You , it was like you needed a different vehicle for every single one of your errands , and no one should have to own 87 different cars . It doesn 't make sense . It 's the chaos of the Web made elegant and simple . Speed round . Paul or John ? Early Paul , late John . - Mario or Sonic ? - Early Sonic , late Mario . Introspection or communication ? - Uh ... - Mae . - Sorry , I 'm thinking about it . - So that 's introspection . - Sushi or Soylent ? - Sushi . Ever owned a Velcro wallet ? - Yes . - Velcro shoes ? - Yes . - Velcro ... pants ? Yes . What was the name of the receptionist who checked you in this morning ? Um ... - Linda . - Joan Baez or Joan Crawford ? - Joan Didion . - " Gif " or " jif " ? [ chuckles ] I 'm not answering that . There 's too much at stake . Would you like to go out with me ?

Jared will be doing your training . I oversee the team , and Jared oversees the unit . As you know , you 'll be doing straight-up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers . You work on your portable here . They send a message to customer experience , and it gets routed over to one of you . Random at first , but once you start working with a customer , they 'll continue to be routed over to you for the sake of continuity . Um , you get the query , figure out the answer , you write them back , and that is the core of it . Simple enough in theory . So far so good ? - [ chuckles ] Uh , yeah . - Cool . So let 's say you 've answered a client 's question , and they seem satisfied . Now , it 's not just that you get a smile or a frown , though that is part of it . You get your smile ... it 's almost always a smile . Um , that is when you send the survey . The survey is a set of quick questions about , you know , your overall service , how you did , and they send that immediately back , and you get to see how you did right here . That is the rating . Uh , you know what ? Let 's just do a live one . - Excuse me . - Sorry . - Okay . - [ types ] - Have a nice day . - [ beeps ] [ taps ] - [ humming ] - [ beeps ] That 's pretty good , 99 is good , but I can 't help wondering why it wasn 't 100 . Let 's look . [ beeps ] Okay . [ types ] Boom . Sometimes you just encounter someone who isn 't really sensitive to the metrics . So it 's important to ask them and make sure you get that clarity .

You got an 87 average . - That 's like a solid B. - How long till I 'm fired ? Listen , when I first started , it took me a few weeks to really get the hang of it . Believe me , okay ? Believe me , you 're doing fine . You 're good , all right ? Mm-hm . Hello , I 'm Eamon Bailey . [ audience cheering ] [ chuckles ] Hey . [ applause continues ] Thank you , thank you . So glad to see you all here . Now a bunch of you are new to the company since I last spoke , so can the guppies all stand up ? - [ Annie ] Right , that 's you . - [ Eamon ] Come on , guppies , just stand up . - Whoo ! - Guppies , stand up , come on . Congratulations , nice to have you . Now " guppies " is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies . Soon you will all grow to become powerful ... - [ laughs ] You 're adorable . - I hate you . ... the fish that guppies grow up into being ... - What do they grow up into ? - [ laughter ] Anyway , all right , this is Dream Friday , the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations . The first Dream Friday featured Ty Lafitte , the inventor of True You and our founding father . And usually , we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries but today unfortunately , it 's just me and for that , - I apologize in advance . - [ laughter ] - [ Annie chuckles ] - [ man ] We love you , Eamon ! Thanks , Mom . [ laughter ] Now you might not have seen me around campus for the last few days , and maybe you were wondering just where the heck I 've been . [ woman ] Surfing ! - [ laughter ] - Argh ! - [ giggles ] - You got me ! Yes , I 've been surfing . And that 's part of what I 'm here to talk about . I love to surf and in the past , I would have to wake up and call the local surf shop to ask about the local breaks , and pretty soon , the local surf shop stopped answering their phone . - [ laughter ] - And then I got a cell phone , and I could call up my buddies who were already out at the beach before me , and I could ask them , but they , too , stopped answering their phones . [ laughter ] And then came ... the Internet . - [ audience cheering ] - Whoa . Oh ! Some geniuses set up cameras on the beaches , so I could log on and get some very crude images of the waves at Stinson Beach . It was almost worse than calling the surf shop . Here 's how it used to look . [ audience groaning ] Almost useless , right ? But now let 's refresh that page and show the site with our new Circle video delivery . - [ audience murmuring ] - Now that looks pretty good , doesn 't it ? Yeah , maybe I should be out there right now . - [ audience chuckling ] - But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera but actually just one of these ? [ audience gasping ] This camera needs no wires . It transmits this image via satellite . I set up that camera this morning . I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit , nothing , in fact , no one even knows it 's there . And actually , I was pretty busy this morning because here 's Rodeo Beach , Montera , Ocean Beach , Fort Point . This is my front yard . [ laughter ] - And here 's my backyard . - [ laughter ] Here 's traffic on the 101 . Oh , did you think this was just a camera ? No , welcome to real time analytic processing . When you see this , you 're also getting this . [ audience murmuring ] Air quality , traffic volume , weather patterns , biometrics , facial recognition , saved and searchable , all to serve you better . My friends , we are looking at retailing these in just a few months for less than a pair of jeans . - [ audience murmurs ] - And I 'm not talking about fancy jeans . I 'm talking about the ones like I 'm wearing . [ woman ] Wow ! Now , Circlers ... do you like to share ? [ all ] Sharing is caring ! Sharing is caring . I thought you might say that . - Sharing is caring ? - Sharing is caring . I have a dozen helpers all over the world right now carrying these cameras . Imagine the human rights implications . Activists no longer have to hold up a camera . Now it 's as easy as gluing a camera to a wall , and actually , we 've done just that . Do you see any cameras here ? No . We have 144 cameras in place here , and it took us just a day to do it , and they 're virtually invisible . They come in every color , so camouflaging is a cinch . This is my favorite . Whoa ! - [ laughs ] - Nice catch . Sign her up . - [ laughter ] - So now , the entire world is watching . You know , I agree with the Hague , with the human rights activists all over the world . There needs to be accountability . Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide . We will see them . We will hear them . We will hear and see everything . If it happens , we 'll know . We 're calling it ... SeeChange . [ applause ] SeeChange . [ audience cheering ] Oh , we 'll know the good things , too . - [ audience ] Aw . - Aw . We will see it all . Because knowing is good . But knowing everything is better . [ cheers , applause ] Whoo ! Yeah ! [ Mae ] Good thing you guys like to keep things modest . What 's this party even for ? SeeChange . Summer solstice .

[ indistinct chattering ] [ indistinct chatter continues ] [ woman ] Today , I call upon the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee to investigate the Circle . We cannot rely on them to say , " We 're not violating antitrust laws . " I 'm sure the Circle will be glad to cooperate . We have every confidence that Senator Williamson 's allegations will be discredited . You are probably wondering about your new screen . - [ chuckles ] - Hi , I 'm Gina . - I 'm Matt . - Hi . Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials . - Do you have time ? - Sure . [ Matt ] Great . I take it last week you were too busy to set up your company social account , and I don 't think you 've imported your old profile . Sorry , I 've just been kind of overwhelmed so far . - Oh . - No , in a good way . I just haven 't had time yet for extracurricular stuff . Wow . That 's so interesting you put it that way . We actually see your profile and the activity on it as integral to your participation here . This is how your coworkers , even the ones on the other side of campus , know who you are . Communication certainly isn 't extracurricular , right ? Right . Of course . We consider you a full knowable person of unlimited potential and a crucial member of the community . But you 're such an enigma . I am ? It 's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here . - Everyone really likes you . - Your work 's been exemplary . Strong ratings for your first week . Are you satisfied with your performance ? Uh , I think I can do better . Good , but it 's not all about work , okay ? - It 's all also about community . - Of course . It 's all connected . But you 've had a blip or two when it comes to meshing with the community , like your absence at several weekend or evening events . Which are , of course , optional . - I 'm sorry ? - [ Gina ] Let 's start with this weekend . You left campus at 11 : 42 p.m. on Friday and got back 8 : 46 a.m. , Monday . Was there work on the weekend ? - Oh , no , no ! - I didn 't ... I 'm sorry . Oh , so sweet . There wasn 't mandatory work on the weekend . This isn 't like a clock in , clock out type place , thank God ! But , you know , there were thousands of people here participating in a hundred different activities . So many . I 'm sorry , I , um ... My dad had an ... an episode , and I was home helping out with that . I 'm so sorry to hear that . Is that related to his MS ? Uh ... yeah . We didn 't know anything about this incident . Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis ? - Annie ? Anybody ? - Uh , no . I ... No . Mae , there are four groups here for staffers dealing with MS , two of them for children of MS patients . Have you sought out a group ? - I didn 't know . - Okay . Can you ... talk about what you did the rest of the weekend ? Nothing , really . I just ... I kayaked . You kayaked ? With who ? Nobody . Just on my own . I kayak . We could have kayaked together . Nothing on your profile about kayaking , no smiles , no ratings , no posts . I 'm no psychologist , but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth . This is what participation is all about , bringing you , lifting you up . Thus , your participation window . I can 't believe you 've been here this long without being on the main social feed . You 're about to have your world rocked . See , these are all of last week 's messages . That 's why there 's so many . - [ stammers ] Eight thousand ? - Mm-hm . Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here . A feast ! - [ chuckles ] - Have fun . Oh , forgot one more thing . This is your participation rank . Party rank for short . Some people here call it the popularity rank , but it 's not really that . It 's just an algorithm-generated number that takes into account all your activity in the inner circle . That makes sense ? - I think so . - Okay . And again , it 's just for fun . - It 's just for fun ! - Okay , bye . [ laughs ] [ man ] Um , I think it 's for Tuesday next week ? [ woman ] Is that in Building 74 or ... ? - [ man ] Uh , no . It 's actually off campus . - [ woman ] Okay . [ types ] [ Mom ] It 's been a month . When are you coming home ? We miss you . I can 't . You know . How 's the dorm ? Do you have to clean your own room ? - We have people that do that . - Ooh , thank God . How 's Dad ? He 's okay . He ... he fell yesterday . And I couldn 't lift him up , but thank God Mercer came by . He 's stronger than I thought . I 'm sorry . I should have been there . Is that one of his ? - Yeah . I think it 's his best work . - It 's awesome . [ camera clicks ] I gotta go , Mom . I love you . - Okay , well , bye . Bye . - Bye . [ types ] I 'm so sorry about last week . I 've been up my own ass . [ chuckles ] And I didn 't mean to be a shitty friend . It 's okay . Where are we going ? Listen , I 've been looking into your parents ' situation , and I think ... I have an idea . All right ? Yeah ? - Hi . - [ woman ] Hi . - This is Jessica . This is Mae . - Hello , Mae , how are you ? I understand you haven 't done your medical intake yet . - No . - Can you drink this for me ? All of it , if you can . - I told you about Mae 's dad 's ... - [ Jessica ] Mm-hm , multiple sclerosis . I did my post doc on MS. Love to get some real time data . Here you go . Okay . - How does this feel ? - Warm . - Is this for free ? - [ laughs ] Of course . You get to keep it . So , it 's going to feel warm for a few days , then you and the media band will get used to each other , but it has to touch the skin to work . Waterproof . No need to take it off . Let 's activate it , shall we ? Is that the ... ? Well , it 's syncing up with the sensor you ingested a second ago . - And now ... - [ computer beeps ] - Let 's have you walk around the room . - [ system beeping ] Briskly . It 'll collect data on your heart rate , blood pressure , cholesterol , sleep duration , sleep quality , digestive efficiency , on and on . And all that data is stored in the Cloud and in your tablet , anywhere you want , and of course , it 's all collated with the rest of the Circle . You 'd be amazed at the patterns we see and the problems we can avoid when we have all that data . Speaking of which , I was thinking it would make sense for ... [ clears throat ] Mae 's folks to come on the Circle health plan . Uh , wait , what ? [ Jessica ] Wouldn 't be the first time , and I 'd really like to get real time data from your dad . - [ pats chair ] - Sit back down . Can you get in touch with HR , - clear it with them ? - [ Annie ] Yep . - Tell them I say it 's a go . - Absolutely . We 'll send someone out to set them up , okay ? [ Mom ] Honey , this is gonna save our lives . - Thank you . And thank Annie too . - [ chuckles ] They thank you . - Aw . - [ laughs ] This is amazing . Call you later , okay ? Okay . I gotta go . Big event here on campus . - Exciting . - I know . - I love you . - I love you , too . - Bye , Mom ! - [ laughs ] Bye . - [ sobs ] Thank you . - Oh . You 're welcome . All right . You okay ? - [ both laughing ] - Okay . Come on . [ crowd cheering , applauding ] [ Tom ] Openness is something we advocate here at the Circle . We live it . We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day . Our government , not so much . We expect openness , and we get obfuscation . We get doublespeak . No wonder Congress ' approval rating is currently at 11 percent . [ crowd murmuring ] Now , I 'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain senator who it was revealed has been involved in some ... very unsavory business . What are we to learn from this ? We need accountability . We need openness . We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime . [ crowd applauding ] To serve us better . Well , I 'm happy to report that there 's a woman who is taking all of this very seriously and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem . So please join me in welcoming . Olivia Santos , Congresswoman for District 14 . [ crowd applauding ] [ Santos ] That 's right , Tom . I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing . So I intend to show exactly how democracy can and should be . Starting today , my every meeting , my every phone call and e-mail will be accessible to my constituents and to the world . - In real time ! - [ crowd cheering ] It will all be on my True You page . That 's right . Thank you , thank you . [ Tom ] Goodbye , backroom deals . Goodbye , shady lobbyists . Hello , democracy . Open and accountable ! [ Santos ] That 's right . That 's a fact ! - [ woman ] Where do you work ? - [ Mae ] I work in customer experience . I started in CE , too . A lot of us did . Cool . Where do you work now ? Biometrics , iris scanning , facial recognition . Right now , I 'm working on Child Track . The program protects children from predators . The second a kid isn 't where they 're supposed to be , an alert goes off and the kid can be tracked down within 90 seconds . - Wow . Do they wear a bracelet or ... ? - We place chips in the bone . [ laughs ] Uh , you 're ... You 're serious ? I 'm serious about immediately reducing kidnapping , rape , and murder by 99 percent . I think I 'm going to get a drink . - But ... - Oh . - It was nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . [ " Assiyo Bellema " playing ] - Hey . - Hey , check your e-mail - ' cause I sent you an invite . - Awesome . Thank you . All right . - Yeah , good to see you . - You too . - Hi , Mae ! How 's it going ? - Hey . - You having fun ? - Yeah , you ? [ chuckles ] Yeah . [ " 18th " playing ] - Hey . - Hey . So , what did you think about the whole presentation ? - The Santos thing ? - Yeah . It 's exciting . It 's a ... - Momentous moment in the history of ... - Okay , what did you really think ? [ sighs ] I thought it was a bit much . - Just a little bit . - [ both chuckling ] So where does all the data go ? Is it stored somewhere ? In the Cloud ? There 's a physical place , too . Do you wanna see something ? [ scanner beeps ] [ beeps ] So you 're gonna have to leave your stuff outside before you go in . Just because you 're not supposed to ... you know . So I 'm just going to have to take ... this . And this . [ door lock clicking ] [ Mae sighs ] I want to thank you already for this . I love following strangers down dark corridors . - This is the best . - Almost there . [ scanner beeps ] This holds Congresswoman Santos , every second of her from now on . And this will be the next one . - Just these ? - Oh , no . There 's more . What is this ? Well , it was supposed to be a part of a subway but they abandoned it . - Where does it go ? - It connects to the bay . But I 've traveled about a half a mile into it , gets too wet . [ water dripping ] And that 's where the rest of it will be . - The rest of what ? - The rest of it all . Santos is just the start . The plan is everything recorded , seen , broadcast , all of it stored , analyzed , available to the Circle in any way . You did your health intake , right ? - Yeah . - See , right ? Look . Every step , every breath , all of it stored . They can use it however they see fit . We 're being studied . Everyone 's data in the Circle is being studied , monetized . It is voluntary . And isn 't that the whole point ? Having everything in one place ? I mean , that 's True You . That 's not why I invented True You . Not even close . Ty Lafitte invented True You . Yeah . I 'm Ty . No , you 're not . Ty Lafitte has been off the grid for years . - Oh , my God . - [ Ty sighs ] I 'm Ty . Why the low profile ? I just wanted to move through this world like a normal person . I didn 't wanna be watched every second . But I do spend a lot of time here . It 's easier . I don 't have to deal with Stenton and Bailey . Not that I 'm privy to their conversations in their little sanctum . Holy shit . I 'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte . Wait , hold on . So when we met , you didn 't know who I was ? You never told me your name . And after a while , it was just weird to ask . [ chuckles ] I knew I could trust you when I met you . I don 't know , I just thought to myself , this girl , she doesn 't have a cynical bone in her body . Reminds me of how I used to be . Listen , you can 't tell anyone that you were here . Okay ? That I brought you here . Okay . Things at the Circle , they need to change . Like what ? Connecting the world ? Insuring my parents ? You should be really proud of what you created . Look , proud ? Proud of what ? The disregard for privacy , the use of personal data for the accumulation of wealth and control ? I 'm not proud . This is not what I created . Do you think Senator Williamson being investigated by the FBI is just a coincidence ? We can 't be seen together , and you have to promise me . You can 't tell anyone that we were down here . [ cell phone buzzes ] Hello ? [ woman ] Mae , you have a visitor here to see you . In the lobby ? [ indistinct chattering ] - Hey . - Hey . - Are you okay ? - No , I 'm really not okay . Why didn 't you call , send a text ? Because I wanted to see you in person . I wanted to look you in the eyes . Okay . - Um , I 'll sign you in . - No , just wait , I ... - The stuff you posted about my work . - Your chandeliers ? Yeah . [ Stammers ] I know you meant well , but ... What 's the problem ? I thought I saw good stuff going up . They started calling me a deer killer . And then there 's a campaign to shut me down . I wasn 't even online . I was working . And when I checked my e-mail , there were death threats . I 'm sorry . Death threats , Mae . Obviously , I never meant for this to happen . But I ... I can fix it . [ Mercer scoffs ] Mae . Mae . Will you listen to me ? I can 't do this . I can 't be a part of this world that you 're creating . What are you talking about ? Jesus Christ , look at these people ! Does this really seem okay to you ? Why don 't you go kill some more deer , Mercer ? I never killed any deer . I don 't kill deer . Mercer , look , let 's not do this here . Let 's go upstairs . - I 'll figure it out . - Do you ever leave this place , Mae ? We used to go on adventures and have fun and see things , and you were brave and excited . And now it 's all filtered through this . Bye . [ sirens wailing ] [ sighs ] [ dog barking ] [ Mae pants ] - [ ship horn blaring ] - [ Mae shrieks ] [ screaming ] [ grunts ] [ sobs ] [ helicopter propeller whirring ] I can 't believe I was so stupid . I 'm so lucky that you guys were around here . Luck ? Hell . SeeChange cameras saved your life . A cop saw you go through the fence , and then we got a call from someone watching the seals . [ Eamon ] So , Mae , how do you feel ? [ glass clinks ] [ Mae ] Ashamed . I ... I barely slept . Well , I 'm just glad you 're safe . We all are . And everyone who watched your adventure online . I hope your folks weren 't too worried . They 're doing okay . I understand your father 's condition has improved . Very much . Mr. Bailey ... I want to say how much I value my position here ... and what you 've done for my family . Mae , you 're a valued part of the Circle , and you 're family . And we care about everybody you care about . You know , this incident has actually shown a lot of people the necessity for SeeChange . I 'm so glad those cameras were there . I wish you would 've known there was a camera there before you swiped that kayak , but ... [ chuckles ] Mae , Tom and I want to talk you about an idea , but before we do , is there anything you want to tell us ? That I 've been here before ? It 's only our lies that get us in trouble , the things we hide . Of course I know you 've been in here before . [ laughter ] And now that I know your secret , do you feel better or worse ? Better . Relieved , actually . I am a believer in the perfectibility of human beings . When we are our best selves , the possibilities are endless . There isn 't a problem that we cannot solve . We can cure any disease and we can end hunger , and ... Without secrets , without the hoarding of knowledge and information , we can finally realize our potential . [ audience cheering , applauding ] [ Eamon ] This is a special Dream Friday . I thought I 'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech but an interview . I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you . I 've asked Mae Holland , who some of you might know as one of our new guppies in customer experience , to join me today . Mae 's only been with us for a few months but she has made quite an impression . Let 's bring her out . Mae Holland ! [ crowd applauding ] [ Eamon ] Well , hi , Mae , how are you ? - Terrified . - Mm . - Don 't be nervous . - [ laughter ] - Easy for you to say . - [ laughter ] All right , Mae , we have all seen the SeeChange footage from the other night , but please describe what happened for us . I committed a crime . I borrowed a kayak without the owner 's knowledge , paddled out to the middle of the bay , and I wasn 't wearing a life jacket . Well , I 'm not sure that 's exactly a capital offense , but you did risk your own life . So , Mae , do you think you behave better or worse - when you are being watched ? - Better . Without a doubt . And what happens when you 're alone and unobserved ? Well , for starters , I steal kayaks . [ laughter ] Jesus . She 's a natural . Seriously . I do things I don 't wanna do . I lie . When we spoke the other day , you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct . Could you tell us all what you said ? I said that secrets are lies . Secrets are lies . Go on . Secrets are what make crimes possible . We behave worse when we 're not accountable . I was my worst self because I didn 't think anyone was watching . I thought ... that I was alone . So , what did you see on this kayaking trip , Mae ? - Was it beautiful ? - [ Mae ] It was . There was almost a full moon . And it felt like ... it felt like I was paddling through liquid silver . Hmm , sounds incredible . But there 's no record of any of it . - Not outside my own memory . - Hmm . [ crowd murmuring ] Okay . So now here we get into something personal . As you know , I have a son , Gunner , who was born with cerebral palsy . And though he 's living a very full life and we 're always trying to improve his opportunities , he is confined to a wheelchair . He can 't walk . He can 't run . He can 't go kayaking . So , what does he do if he wants to experience something like that ? Well , he watches video . He looks at pictures . And much of his experiences of the world come through the experience of others . When he experiences the view of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya , he feels like he 's climbed Mount Kenya . When he sees firsthand video from an America 's Cup crew member , he feels in some way that he 's sailed in the America 's Cup too . And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans who shared what they saw with the world , my son included , and there are many others out there that are just like Gunner . Now does it feel right to have deprived them of seeing what you saw , Mae ? It doesn 't . It feels very wrong . It was selfish . When you deprive others of experiences like the ones I had , you 're essentially stealing from them . Knowledge is a basic human right . Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right . [ audience cheering , applauding ] Thank you , Mae , for your candor and your consummate humanity . Now ... now the best part . In the interest of sharing everything she can with the world , Mae has , uh ... Mae has some news . From now on ... I 'll be wearing a modified SeeChange camera at all times . I 'm going fully transparent . [ audience cheering , applauding ] Well , maybe not in the bathroom . [ laughter ] I 'll be starting immediately . [ Eamon ] That 's right . Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second of her work and her personal life with the public , so let 's give her an even bigger hand ! [ applause continues ] I 'm proud of you . [ all chant ] Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! Mae ! [ alarm clock ringing ] - [ camera clicks ] - [ operator ] Hello . Good morning , everyone . The sun is shining , and I definitely need my coffee . We are in my third week of transparency , and we 're up to ... 2,308,007 viewers . Wow . Did I tell you guys I 'm not a morning person ? Okay , among all of those viewers ... are ... - [ Mom ] I don 't even know what ... - Hi , Mom , hi , Dad . - Hi ! - Hi , Mae . Say hello to everyone . - [ both ] Hello , Circle . - [ Mae laughs ] Look . We match . - Yeah . - We sure do . - These are great . - Very stylish . I love you guys . I 'll see you later . - Love you . Bye . - Love you too , sweetheart . - Hello , Circlers . - [ all ] Hi , Mae . So this is where I worked when I first arrived at the Circle , and this is where I still work at the Circle . [ Chuckles ] Because even though I have you guys looking over my shoulder ... [ sighs ] I 'm still basically a guppy . - [ laughs ] Go ! Do it ! - Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! - [ growls ] - Oh , my God ! [ Laughs ] [ man ] What are you doing ? Tell your own stories , sheep . Stop looking at us , sheep ! All right , that 's our scene . - [ crowd applauding , cheering ] - Whoo ! Sorry about that . Okay , so , next up , we just need the name of a person who is historically significant . - Mae Holland ! [ Laughs ] - Oh , my God ! Sorry , we don 't know who that is . - She 's nobody , trust me . - [ laughter ] Home sweet home . Speaking of which , let 's check in with the folks . Hey , where are you guys ? - [ moans ] - Yeah . - Yeah . There you go . - Whoa ! Ah ! Um ... [ breathing heavily ] Uh , I hope the engineers are watching , because that definitely shouldn 't have happened [ chuckles ] And , um , it definitely won 't happen again . [ Laughs ] - You can trust me there . - [ Mae 's dad moaning ] [ laughs ] This is me brushing my teeth . If you 're enjoying this , I 'm worried about you . [ watch beeps ] [ exhales ] Good night , everyone . I 'm not gonna lie , it was a crazy day , but I 'm happy I had you with me , each and every one of you . [ Mae ] Never a boring day here . A lot of you guys have been asking me about this sculpture , which is a treat for me . I finally get to use my art history degree . This was made by an artist who has frequently been in trouble in his own country . I wanna thank all the watchers who sent frowns to the government there , both for their persecution of the artist and for their restriction on Internet freedoms . We have sent 180 million frowns from the U.S. alone . You can bet that 's gonna have an effect on the regime . Annie . [ indistinct chattering ] [ Mae ] Annie . Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Annie Allerton ! [ Pants ] Are we alone ? I have three minutes to use the bathroom without the video on . [ scoffs ] Pervs . How are you ? [ Chuckles ] - Good . - Well ... you should be good . You 're killing it . Do you think ? Oh , come on , false modesty won 't work here . You should be psyched . Yeah . - I am . - You 're a meteor . It 's insane . People are coming to me trying to get to you . [ Chuckles ] It 's ... crazy . How are you really , Annie ? You look wiped . Thanks , Mae . You know how much I like to be told right after I appear in front of your millions that I look terrible . Thank you , you 're sweet . Let me take you for dinner . [ sighs ] You gotta eat sometime . Your camera and me looking so terrible . That sounds fantastic , but , no . I just ... [ stutters ] I 'm worried about you . - You 're working too hard . - You 're worried about me ? You 're ... I 'm worried about the EU , but it 's good to know you 're worried about me . - I didn 't mean it that way . - Don 't worry in any way . - I know you can handle it . - Oh , thank you , Mae . Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings . How are your parents ? Sorry . [ exhales ] They 're over that little ... episode ? I haven 't heard from them , actually . [ sniffs ] I guess it 'll just take some time . Sorry , Mae . Shit . I 'm fried . And I have to pull another all-nighter . Stenton is on my ass all the time . I shouldn 't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing . And then ... there 's all the new work on Completion . But I assume Bailey told you about that . Of course . [ Annie ] Of course . I 'll be there at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow . What ? - There 's a Concept Kingdom ... - I know what it is . But you 're going ? - Yeah . Bailey said I should be there . - And broadcast it ? - Is that a problem ? - No . I 'm just surprised , that 's all . Those meetings are sensitive . You know , maybe he 's planning on having you attend just the beginning . [ chuckles ] I mean , Mae , you 're in over your head . [ Mae ] Are you leaving ? Yeah . [ Clears throat ] I 'm really so far behind on everything , I could just die . Annie ? - [ camera chimes ] - [ operator ] Hello . See ya . [ Eamon ] So here 's how many people voted in the last national election . Here 's how many were eligible to vote . And here is how many Americans are registered in the Circle . - [ laughter ] - And there 's that guy . So now we get down to the meat of today 's session , something we 've discussed with Congresswoman Santos and others . What if ... your Circle profile automatically registered you to vote ? With True You , in order to set up a profile , you have to be a real person with a real address , the complete personal info , real social security number , with all the information that the government wants when you register to vote . So why wouldn 't the state consider you already registered when you open a Circle account ? There 's no reason . Uh , we 've got verbal commitments from governors of almost every state , and they 've agreed to push for legislation that would make your Circle account an automatic path to voter registration . [ man ] Bravo . I think it 's a great idea . Well , yes , Mae . Why couldn 't we take it one step further ? I mean , I ... I don 't have it completely figured out yet ... No , no , no , go on , go on , go on . You started really well there . I like those words , " one step further . " It 's how the company was built . Okay . Working backwards from your goal ... Go on . We all agree 100 percent participation is what we 'd like . A hundred percent participation is the ideal . That 's the idealist 's ideal , yes . And we already have 83 percent of voting-age Americans registered to the Circle . Yep . And it seems we 're on our way to users being able to register it and maybe actually vote through their Circle account . Well , that 's a small leap , but ... Yes . Okay , go on . Why not require every voting-age citizen to have a Circle account ? - [ all murmuring ] - Let her finish . Let her finish . Okay , I know the initial reaction will be resistance . I mean , how can we require anyone to use our services ? But there are all kinds of things that are mandatory for citizens of this country . Yep . We have to pay taxes we don 't wanna pay . And we have to pay for Social Security . - We have to serve on juries . - Right . And we have to pee indoors , not on the street . [ Chuckles ] - We do . We do have to be pee indoors . - She 's right . I mean , we have thousands of laws . We require citizens to do hundreds of things , but we don 't require them to vote ? They are already doing this in dozens of countries . With the technology we already have , users will already be registered . That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote . You have 241 million voters that have to vote . You have the full will of the nation . - And how exactly do we do that ? - Annie . Well , you know , it could be something as simple as a zing , " Hey , Annie . Remember to take five minutes and vote . " It 's what we would do with our own surveys . You know that . - But , Mae , what about stragglers ? - We all pay taxes . And what , 80 percent of us did that online last year . Why not stop duplicating services ? Why not just make it all part of one unified system ? You could pay your taxes , vote , pay your parking ticket , all through your Circle account . We 'd save users hundreds of hours of inconvenience . - We 'd save the government billions . - Hundreds of billions . We could eliminate half of it overnight . Why wouldn 't the government just build a similar service ? Why the hell does it need us ? It would cost too much . They don 't have the expertise . - We already have the infrastructure . - [ Eamon ] You 're absolutely right . The government needs us more than we need them . Imagine having the full will of the people . Instantly . You 'd have ... true democracy for the first time in human history . - [ Annie ] This is such bullshit . - [ door opens ] [ door closes ] No voter suppression . You 're voting from home . Think of the implications for totalitarian regimes . No more rigged elections . The UN can demand that they 're held through the Circle . - But only if everyone is heard . - [ murmuring ] Every human on Earth . We can take the pulse of the nation , everyone in the world in seconds on any subject . - It 's the only way , right ? - Right . [ all ] Yeah ! So it looks like I 've got 20 minutes here . Let 's try Mom and Dad . - [ line ringing ] - [ man 1 ] Hey , Mae , what 's up ? - Hi . - [ laughter ] - Hey , where have you been ? - Mae . I 've seen your cameras aren 't working . I can send Tech out ... Yeah , we disconnected them . - Sweetheart ... - [ sighs ] We 're sorry , but we , we can 't keep doing this . It 's ... Well , it 's more than we ever ... [ Mom ] You know we love you , and we don 't wanna ... - We love you . We love you . - We have to have our privacy . And we 're worried you don 't realize what you 've gotten yourself into . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt you . - [ Dad ] It 's not you . It 's us . - No , we know that . - Yeah , it 's us . - We just need you to understand that . [ sighs ] - I love you . - We love you too . Bye , honey . [ sniffles ] - [ man ] You 're the one , Mae ! - [ woman ] You 're changing the world , Mae ! [ sighs ] [ crowd cheering , applauding ] [ man hooting ] - Hello , everyone . I 'm Mae Holland . - [ crowd cheering , applauding ] [ laughs ] Okay . We 've had some good weeks thinking about Completion , envisioning a day when everyone is in the Circle , when all of humanity is connected and united . And it will happen . Already , 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through the Circle with mandatory participation from all of its citizens . [ crowd cheering , applauding ] And when everyone is united , everyone is known , heard , accountable , they can be better served . But what about the people who aren 't part of the Circle , who don 't want to be woven into the fabric of society or worse , want to tear out that fabric ? I want to introduce Soul Search . And we 're putting it to the test in front of the entire Circle audience , here and globally . Do you feel ready ? - [ woman ] Hell , yeah ! - [ all cheering ] [ Tom ] You went well so far . Great . In seconds , the computer will select , at random , a fugitive from justice , a proven menace to our global community . Our assertion is that whoever he or she is , Soul Search will locate them in under 20 minutes . - [ woman ] Wow . - [ crowd applauding ] Let 's select that fugitive . Okay . This is Fiona Highbridge , 44 years old born in Manchester , England . She was convicted of triple murder in 2004 . She locked her three children in the closet and went on holiday to Spain . [ crowd murmuring ] They all starved . She was sent to prison in England but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced . Over a billion people are watching . Let 's see how many are in the UK . Do you all think 14 million Brits and a billion global participants worldwide can find Fiona Highbridge in under 20 minutes ? - [ crowd cheering ] - [ woman ] Yeah ! [ man ] Yeah ! All right . Let 's bring up the clock . Good . - Is everyone ready ? - [ crowd cheering ] On your mark ... get set ... go ! [ crowd continuously cheering ] [ laughter ] Okay , time to get serious . [ woman ] I 've got her , Mae . [ crowd applauding ] That 's her . Be careful . I will . - [ crowd cheering ] - [ man ] Whoa ! [ man ] Whoa ! [ woman ] Fiona ! Stop ! - Follow her . - Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! She 's a killer ! Stop her ! Somebody stop her ! - [ woman ] Go ! - [ man ] Grab her ! Stop her ! Somebody grab her ! - [ Tom ] She must be kept safe . - Keep her safe . - It 's Fiona Highbridge ! - [ Fiona ] No ! No ! No ! [ crowd cheering , applauding ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ man ] All right . Watch it . [ Fiona ] No . [ crowd cheering ] Stop the clock . [ woman ] Soul Search , baby ! - I guess that 's it . - [ crowd cheering and applauding ] [ woman ] Let 's do another ! We could . - Um ... - [ Tom ] Maybe not a fugitive this time . Let 's try for a regular civilian . Okay , everyone . We 're gonna find a regular person . It can be anyone . A relative , a lost love . When everyone can be found , we can never lose a friend . We can take a suggestion from the audience . - Uh ... anyone ? - [ woman ] Find Mercer ! [ laughter , hooting ] I 'm pretty sure he doesn 't wanna be found . [ Chuckles ] - Anyone else ? - [ man ] Where 's Mercer ? [ Tom ] No , Mae , this is what Soul Search is all about as well as Completion . Other suggestions ? - [ woman ] Let 's try Mercer . - [ crowd ] Mercer ! Mercer ! Mercer ! It 's the whole point of Soul Search , Mae . No . [ crowd ] Mercer ! Mercer ! - Mercer ! Mercer ! Mercer ! - [ Mae ] No , no , no , no . No , I ... [ Tom ] Mae , this is the right choice . [ Eamon ] Wait . Hey , everybody . - [ crowd cheering and applauding ] - [ Eamon ] Hey . I think it 's time we reunited Mae and Mercer , don 't you ? [ crowd cheering ] All right then . And through the power of the Circle , let 's bring them back together again , okay ? The perfect use of Soul Search . Let 's find your friend . [ crowd cheering , applauding ] Go , Mae , now . Okay . So our second Soul Search today involves not a fugitive from justice , but you might say a fugitive from , um ... a friendship . [ laughter ] This is my friend Mercer . I haven 't seen him in a while . I 'd love to see him again . Like Fiona , though , he is someone who is trying not to be found , but unlike Fiona , he 's not a criminal . He 's good , people . Let 's see if we can break our previous record . Whoo ! [ breathes heavily ] - [ crowd cheering ] - [ man ] Oh , yeah . Unbelievable . Can you believe that ? Yes ! [ man ] Do you think he 's in here ? - Mercer ! - [ man ] Mercer ! Mercer , are you in there ? Are you , like , killing deer , making chandeliers ? [ audience laughing ] [ woman ] Mercer , we know you 're in there . We see your truck . It 's right here . - [ man ] I think he 's in there . - Fine . Let 's go around . - [ woman ] Oh , my God , he 's in there ! - [ crowd laughing ] Mercer , come out . He 's gotta be here . Remember to be nice , okay ? Mercer , we know you 're in there . You found where he is . You did it . I think we should leave . [ Tom ] No , Mae , stay on this . You 've got millions of people enjoying this . [ woman ] There he is . There he is . There he is . We just got Mercer . I cannot believe this . [ woman ] There he is ! He 's in the driveway ! [ engine starting ] [ Mercer ] Leave me alone ! Jesus Christ ! [ crowd cheering ] [ crowd continuously cheering ] [ motorcycle revving ] [ whispers ] You 're kidding me . [ crowd cheering ] Can someone please get me audio on the camera ? Mercer . Mercer , stop driving . It 's just me . Mercer , stop the truck . You 're surrounded by friends . [ car honking ] Can we turn the speaker up ? Mercer . Can you hear me ? Mercer , it 's me . [ whispers ] You 're surrounded by friends . [ crowd murmuring ] Mercer , stop . [ grunts ] [ screams ] [ birds chirping ] - [ knocking on door ] - [ door opens ] [ Mom ] How you doing , sweetie ? You 've been in bed for three days . Come out in the garden with me today , okay ? I 've got some new snapdragons that need to be planted . Okay ? Honey . Oh , honey . - [ sniffles ] - Oh . - Oh . - [ sobs ] [ announcer over radio ] The California Department of Motor Vehicles has proposed regulation that self-driving cars should be required to have a licensed driver inside . Is that a good principle ? [ man ] Yeah , I mean , I think obviously , where technology is today that is a good principle , and of course , we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road . That 's why we have fed ... [ sighs ] [ line ringing ] Mae . Where are you ? - Are we alone ? - Yes . Are we ? Yes . How is it daytime where you are ? Wait , you 're in Scotland . Yep , I went home . Can you see ? What happened ? What , besides almost ODing on speed and Soylent ? Well , I found out I 'm allergic to wheat . [ both chuckling ] Um ... I don 't know . I guess I almost died ? Oh , come on , no , don 't . Don 't make me cry . Come on . No . I 'm not going to cry anymore . You getting better there ? Yeah , I am . I eat . I look out the window . I come out here , and I think I daydream . Hadn 't done that in years . I 'm glad you called . I didn 't want to lose you , too . I know . Listen , Mae , I 'm really , really sorry about Mercer . And I 'm a shit friend . I should 've said something sooner . I should 've , and I 'm sorry . It 's just so horrible . Have they spoken to you about it ? Not yet . I 'm going in tomorrow . Uh-huh . They ask for forgiveness and never for permission . They have to go . They 've broken a hundred laws . They 've made me suffer a thousand regulations . There 's got to be a way to ... What ? Stop people doing bad shit ? [ scoffs ] Yeah . Do you need some time away here , too ? I 've got an extra bed if you want it . [ chuckles ] This feels so good , just being with you . - Even like this . - Yeah . Yeah . I know . This is going to sound crazy . But ... I keep having this feeling that ... Mercer would still be here if we hadn 't lost touch . No , come on , what were you supposed to do ? I mean , you know , he drifted away . It happens . Yes , but we have this technology , all this power . Well , I mean , technology didn 't exactly help the situation . What if it could ? [ coffee maker clanking ] [ Mom ] Hey , your dad woke up at 4 : 00 this morning , and your light was still on . What were you doing in your room ? Were you on the phone ? It helped . I have friends all over the world . They care . Mm . - I spoke to Annie . - [ Mom ] How is she ? Good . Better . I realized how much I missed her . I have to go back . Go back where ? Not to the Circle . The Circle didn 't kill Mercer , Mom . It was a bad tool , a bad system . It ... It can be fixed . We 're not gonna become Amish , Mom . I ... When someone dies in a plane crash , you don 't abandon planes , you make them safer . - Mae , at least wait a bit . - [ sighs ] I 'm the only one who can do this . I 'm sorry . I love you . [ line ringing ] - [ Ty ] Hello ? - [ Mae ] Hey , it 's me . Mae . How are you holding up ? [ Mae ] Better , actually . I 'm coming in to see them today . - But I need your help . - Sure . Name it , anything you need . [ Eamon ] We were worried when we didn 't hear from you for so long . [ Tom ] We were very concerned . No contact for four days . Your camera was off . How are you doing ? I 'm okay . Tom and I have been talking about how little we knew about this young man Mercer . He 's someone we should have been able to help . A fund should be established for his family . Yeah , absolutely , that 's done . Listen , Mae , we would like to offer you a new role here at the Circle with no formal obligation , maybe a lighter schedule . You can choose your own projects , and you can think long-term . - You could take pottery , if you wanted . - [ Tom laughs ] I don 't know if you 're aware of this , - but one of our founders , Ty Lafitte ... - Yeah . ... was given the same opportunity , and now he loves his freedom . And I don 't know if this is any consolation , but at our next Dream Friday ... [ stammers ] We 're going to imagine a world in which every disturbed young man could be kept safe . Would you like to join us ? I 'm not sure I 'm ready for that . But ... thanks for the invitation . Take your time . [ indistinct chattering ] [ cell phone buzzing ] I did what you asked . You won 't believe the shit I found . It 's worse than I could 've imagined . And , and look , Mae , I 'm so sorry . I never met him , but they should build a monument to Mercer . - Yeah . - I mean , this ... this changes everything . Okay , he 's the martyr who will wake everyone up , right ? I don 't know what you 're planning , but if you turn that camera back on , whatever you say about the Circle is heard around the world , and it changes everything . [ operator ] Hello . Hello again . - Hi ! - Hey , Mae . And that is how it should have been , how it could 've been , but we didn 't have the technology . But we will . And when we do , when every vehicle is known and connected , the data we have will help us improve traffic patterns , keep drivers safe , and optimize Circle services across all platforms . Shopping . Lodging . Attractions . Attractions like Mae Holland . - Mae , come on out here . - [ crowd cheering ] Come on out here . Gosh , Mae . Oh , you 're transparent again . Look at that . Hello , hello . Mae Holland . - [ crowd cheering ] - [ man ] Welcome back , Mae ! Now , Mae is a brave person because even amid her grieving , she knows that she has a responsibility to her followers , to the whole world , really . Thanks for saying that , Eamon . And I couldn 't agree with you more . I know that Tom , he agrees , too . - Right , Tom ? You want to come out ? - [ crowd applauding ] - Come on . - There you are . First , I want to thank everyone here and around the world for the support you 've given me since we lost Mercer . These past days , I 've realized something about myself and about the Circle . It 's that I don 't want to be disconnected . I don 't want to have to search for friends , family , my loved ones . We lost track of Mercer . But what if we never lost touch with each other ? What if instead of searching ... we always knew ? What I am proposing is radical openness and unbroken connection . It would have to start here . - [ crowd applauding ] - Mm-hm . You know the usual hypocrisy of the digital world . We want everything in the Cloud , and yet our leaders ... live above it . So I want to invite Eamon and Tom to join me in this experiment that they 've pioneered . I invite them to set an example for the Circle and the world ... to go transparent . [ crowd cheering , applauding ] What do you say , guys ? Will you join me ? Wouldn 't it be great to know their every move , their every word ? From now on , every message , meeting , phone call , all will be public , knowable , never erased . In fact , Ty Lafitte has helped us make every document in the company 's history public . Every message , every plan including ... And this is my favorite part , every e-mail , from Tom and Eamon 's accounts , and their private accounts ... [ crowd murmuring ] ... and their secondary confidential accounts . [ Chuckles ] And even their super-secret scrambled code accounts , that nobody , not even their assistants or wives knew existed . Until now . It 's all been sent to you already . [ murmuring ] We are so fucked . I think we 're entitled to that kind of access . Don 't you ? - [ all ] Yeah . - [ hooting ] Mae , you are a very brave woman to do this . There are no more secrets . Privacy was a temporary thing . And now it 's over . We won 't live in the shadows anymore . Hey . Good timing . [ Chuckles ] [ cell phones beeping ] [ indistinct chattering ] Thank you . Thank you . I 'm tired of hiding , these passwords and secret knocks , the difference between public and private . Aren 't you all ? Come to think of it , I 'm tired of standing here in the dark . Don 't worry . Eamon will catch up . Or maybe he won 't . Either way , it 's time for a change . We 're gonna remake this place . And if we do it right , we will set an example for everyone . The future won 't wait .

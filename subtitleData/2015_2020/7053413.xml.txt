THE WHISPERING STAR Humanity thus repeated their substantial disasters and monumental failures . People died off every time they did . Space is now ensconced in a quiet peace . Machines control space , where robot A.I. account for 80 % , and humans account for the other 20 % . In space , humans are already regarded as a species on the brink of extinction . The pursuit of science is all but completed , but humans can still only live for up to 100 years . Among space , the human population is but a vanishing candle . That tickles . Stop it ! It tickles . It tickles , I said . Stop it ! Stop it , I said ! It 's been 10 years . Spaceship number - - Z. Code A-126 . My name is Yoko Suzuki . It 's been 10 years today since we departed . I thought I 'd record a voice diary every day . Erm , firstly ... why I chose to rent this ship - one : the antique interior was nice ; yet in contrast the equipment loaded on board was highly efficent and useful . I like things like kitchens , taps , and gas heating . I work in home delivery , so it suits me . Ah , 6-7 M.I.M.E , you say something too . This is computer 6-7 , M.I.M.E. That 's my voice . Good evening . This is Yoko Suzuki . Machine number 722 . 10 years and 3 weeks since we entered space . The tap has stopped working . When I turn off the water , it makes a weird sound . For the record , I 'll demonstrate . Good evening . This is Yoko Suzuki . Machine number 722 . 14 years , 8 months and ... 3 days since this journey started . Recently , 6-7 M.I.M.E. has been acting up . Making unintelligible reports , discovering imaginary meteors and falling stars , changing the course trajectory constantly ... there 's actually nothing at the moment , but I still ought to be careful . It looks like it 'll take some time to investigate the origin of the problem . Good evening . Yoko Suzuki- - machine number 722 . 10 years and 8 months have passed since we started our journey . I 'm unable to see any illicit nature in 6-7 M.I.M.E. ' s regulation , however , he is not registering any seismic activity- - It could just be my imagination , but ... perhaps the outside and the inside of the ship have become reversed for him . Where is he looking at when he speaks ? This is Yoko Suzuki , machine number 722 . It 's been 14 years , 9 months and 3 days , to the day . What I feared has turned out to be true . 6-7 M.I.M.E. is looking at the ceiling light . He only looks at the bodies of dead insects and the movements of the ones still alive in the light casing . These are insects that came in through the entrance when we disembarked on a planet named Tum . I 'm unable to repair the 6-7 M.I.M.E. all on my own . Until he realises that by himself , he 's unable to use the trajectory-changing apparatus . How bothersome . If I clean the ceiling , I 'm sure he 'd have a panic attack . I know . I know for sure I 'm wrong . But just give me a bit more time . Don 't worry . We all make mistakes . I 'm a machine too . This is Yoko Suzuki . Rental spaceship number Z. For the purpose of staving off boredom during long travel times , I 'm recording this for the next person that rents this ship . As a home delivery personnel , I 'm currently approaching Planet Wurtz . My work will be done after 82 more deliveries . A time lag of 2 to 3 years from the planned delivery date is generally forgiven . It 's expected that , if all goes well , my last delivery will be made on the 20th of March , 11 years from now . This is - - This is Yoko Suzuki . Rental spaceship number Z. Machine number 722 . For the purpose of staving off boredom during long travel times , I 'm recording this for the next person that rents this ship . Soon , a different Yoko Suzuki will be living here . We were produced at the same factory . I believe their machine number was between 620 and 790 . I 'm not sure if I 'll be able to meet up with her again . We are now entering landing position . Waiting long ? - Not really . See ya later . Can I count ? Hey . Can I count ? 1 chair . 1 table . 1 Parselum oil . 1 Milky Way galaxy . 1 refridgerator . 1 bag . 7 suns . 2 skids . 1 hot water . 1 chest of drawers . 12 shooting stars . 1 Earth . 1 kitchen . 2 towels . 1 me . 1 Yoko Suzuki . 1 cupboard . 1 ceiling . 3 shop windows . 1 me . 1 Yoko Suzuki . 81 delivery items . 1 me . 1 Yoko Suzuki . Only humans request home delivery . Machines don 't understand why people want delivery that takes this amount of time . The senders are human , so the recipients are too . I don 't know what 's in the packages . They 're probably not for information transfer . One might surmise that the sentiment of not using teleportation , taking years upon years to deliver something to someone , could be the only way to convey true feeling . Initially , when instant teleportation became as widely used as household articles , it was unthinkable that such degenerate methods would still be used . Or , so humans have recently stated . The only time teleportation was thought to be convenient was the very beginning . The feeling of adoration toward the furthest country , the romance beyond the Milky Way - all lost ; the simplification of going anywhere as if it were merely the next room made everything go from being three-dimensional to flat-surfaced . Human feeling ... deteriorated . The adoration toward distance and time is not something machines can comprehend . Rather , the last pride of humanity may be that which comes from the impotence of machines . This adoration toward distance and time is probably ... similar to the pulsing of a heartbeat to a human . See ya later . You 're Dotty , right ? Why are you so quiet ? Aren 't you and I buddies ? We 're old friends , right ? Why the long face ? Want to come along with me ? Woof , woof , woof , woof . This is it for us too . What are you doing ? Can 't you tell me ? What were you doing ? Ah . You 're re-tying your shoelaces . Why don 't you scratch it if it 's itchy ? Where 'd you come from ? That way . That way , huh . From over there , then looping around from there . You came in that ? - Yes . It makes a nice sound . What 's that ? It 's a bicycle . It 's called a bicycle . You don 't know what it is ? - Yeah . I 'll give it to you . No thanks . Rank code 894-90 . This is computer machine 6-7 M.I.M.E. , code 894-90 . We 're off . All systems go . Hey . Why don 't we go somewhere for a drink ? I 'm on my way home . Come back soon . I 'll be dead before long . You 'll be young forever , though . Rank code 894-90 .

We can 't see the star we were just at anymore . Are men like the one from before your type ? The star from before has disappeared . There 's nothing . Good evening . This is Yoko Suzuki , machine number 722 . It 's been 10 years and 3 weeks since venturing out into space . The tap has stopped working . When I turn off the water , it makes a weird sound . For the record , I 'll demonstrate . Thanks , Yoko . I 'm sorry . I said too much . That feels really good . 1 YEAR LATER 5 : 23 : 07 P.M. " YOKO SUZUKI " " Ingrid Coach " .

It doesn 't look that good , really . - I suppose so ... thank you . Thank you . Shall we walk toward there for a while ? Thanks very much . This is computer machine 6-7 M.I.M.E. We will soon arrive at A-6AB . Are there any changes to the course ? I 'll wait for 10 seconds . Examining . Consulting . No objections . This is computer machine 6-7 M.I.M.E. Course change nil .

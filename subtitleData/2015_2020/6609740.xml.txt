 LUCY : Previously on Killjoys ... From the time you receive the box , you 'll have one week to assassinate the target . Khlyen wants you dead . And I want to know why . ( GROANING ) ( GRUNTS ) Why did you come to the Quad , D 'avin ? I 'm looking for someone . A doctor . You have to protect him . He 's family . So are you . I 'll take your advice and find work . Algae farm night watchman . Another option . Killjoy . JOHN : Dutch should be here . This is important . Knock it off . What ? Your leg . You 're nervous . Stop . You should be nervous . I just want you to know ( SIGHS ) that if you do pass , I 'm going to be a cool boss . One more word , I 'll choke you to sleep . That 's a little aggressive . ( DOOR BEEPS ) John Jaqobis . Sponsoring agent . Keera Deen . Don 't give a shit . Heard all about your tech exam . Set a course record . I like to be thorough . Look , we get a lot of ex-military . Most of them wash out . They can 't take the independent thought we require from our agents . Convince me you 're different . Why do you want to be a Killjoy ? Um ... I believe in what the RAC stands for ... No . Don 't care . Try again . My team is excellent and I think that ... Strike two . Tell you what , hero , you get back to me when you figure it out . I don 't fit in anywhere else . I 'm not cut out to be civilian and I 'm done being a soldier . I 'm not good at a lot of things , but I 'm good at that . And I would be good for the RAC . Okay . Fist to heart . D 'avin Jaqobis , as of now , you are nobody 's citizen , nobody 's soldier . You renounce all loyalties except these , our code , your team and the warrant . How do you swear ? I will take no sides , take no bribes . The warrant is all . I swore that I wouldn 't cry . Welcome to the family . Take him to celebrate . You 've been cleared for Level Four . Whoa , whoa ! Wait , wait , wait . Level Four ? Do I outrank you ? You can grab your badge at supply just as soon as you pass your psych eval . Say again ? ( DOOR CLOSES ) Come on . Let 's go find Dutch . ( WHIMPERS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( WEEPING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) DUTCH : Hello , darling . ( DOOR CLOSES ) I 'm back with treats . It 's been days , you must be parched . ( MUFFLED GRUNTS ) Now , let 's try this again . Why does Khlyen want you dead ? And how do I find him ? ( BREATH ES HEAVILY ) I don 't know . Wrong answer . ( SOBS ) Please . You have two options . Keep your secrets , or keep your life . I don 't know any Khlyen . Please , don 't do this . Please . I 'm telling you the truth . You know I am . If you 're not , you 'll wish your death had been this easy . ( PANTS ) Now run . Somewhere no one can find you . ( GRUNTS ) Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone If you 're Level Three , how do I outrank you already ? The RAC works in mysterious ways . Wait , can you even kill people ? Of course I can kill people . When accompanied by a Level Four or higher . ( CHUCKLES ) JOHN : Oof , that 's a lotta Jakk . Yeah , easier just to burn it , no ? Sure , if you want to knock out half of Old Town . Stuff 's toxic . Not to mention extremely flammable . D 'AVIN : Hey , so what 's the deal with this psych eval I 've got to get ? Any tips ? I don 't know . Don 't be crazy . ( MAN SHOUTING ) ( GRUNTS ) You know Pree gives us all those free drinks ? Yeah . Nothing 's free on this moon . Come on . ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLS ) This little arrangement that we have is becoming less charming . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) My best Hokk . Should dull the pain . You want to tag in ? ( GRUNTING ) Nah , he 's good . He 's Level Four . You really need to close shop during Harvest Week . Please . Migrants all come back from Leith loaded with Joy . And if they 're buying , you know I 'm pouring . PAWTER : Hey . ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) Hi . So , the best part about being as drunk as I am right now ... ls that you won 't remember any of this in the morning ? Oh . I 'm going to want to remember this . Excuse me. ls that the guy that threw you ? PAWTER : Yep , he owes me a new drink . Hey , buddy . ( GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) Okay , I think he learned his lesson . D 'avin ! D 'av , that 's enough ! ( GUN SHOT ) ( ALL GASPING ) I have a headache , a badge and a gun . Behave . Hey , where have you been ? Hey . Okay . Sexers are offering 20 % off upstairs . Harvest Special . You 're bleeding . I 'm celebrating . Level Four . Watch out , I 'm catching up . You pass your psych eval yet ? Go see Pawter . DUTCH : She runs a clinic out of a room upstairs . See if she 'll rubber stamp you . She 's your doctor ? Seriously ? We can 't take you on missions until you clear your psych . It 's just ... ( SIGHS ) D 'avin 's like a comet , you know ? Hmm , right , comet . ( MOANS ) Me , I 'm ... I 'm more like dark matter . I 'm stable . I hold things together . John , Mmm-hmm . If you just want to talk ... I know , you charge the same amount , that 's cool . So , where was I ? If you want to talk , there 's something I 'd like to discuss , too . It 's Vincent . My husband . So , what 's going on ? He spends half the year on Leith . He goes to plant Hokk , and comes back before Harvest . But this year , he hasn 't . So , maybe he decided to stay on and earn some extra Joy . I haven 't heard from him . Nobody has . So , he just disappeared ? His visa expires in two days . If Vincent 's not back by then , the penalty is 10 years of hard labor . I co-signed the work visa . If they can 't find him ... His sentence is automatically transferred to you . ( SIGHS ) N 'oa . You have to find him . I put out a warrant on him . I want you to take it . You know I love you , Johnny , but nope . No way . Oh , come on . It 's a legitimate warrant , and a favor for a friend . It 's a win-win . Unless you fail-fail . Also , stop being friends with everyone you sleep with . It 's just weird . Hey , if the thought of poor sweet N 'oa dying a slow death in the yttrium mines doesn 't bother you ... ( FORCEFUL COUGHING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Please . Hey , the Company makes examples of illegal exiles . You know it . Where is the target ? On Leith , during Harvest Fest . So , we grab Vincent , make some Joy , blow it all on pumpkin beer and grackle , all while we soak up the sun . Did I mention that we 're going to be going undercover ? You love undercover . ( GRUNTS ) Ouch . What 's with the burn ? Nothing . Stupid accident . Why are you so keen on this warrant ? Just " I want us both to get away and have some fun . You know , before D 'avin joins the team . And besides , you have seemed a little tense lately . What the hell . I wouldn 't mind being someone else for a while . But I get to choose our covers . That never goes well for me . ( DUTCH CHUCKLES ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) D 'AVIN : So , you sobered up fast . Ancient doctor 's secret . We have all the best pills . So , you kind of lost it out there . Do you always fight with such intensity ? When I get angry enough . I didn 't get this from the fight , though . I got it acing the Killjoy test . If you 're the pass , I 'd hate to see the fail . Oh , my eyes are fine . Even Killjoys get concussions . I 'm fine . Besides , I 'm not a full Killjoy , yet . I still need to pass my psych eval , and was hoping you could sign it for me . Oh ... You need a RAG-certified doctor , and I 'm the only one around for miles . Okay . What 's in it for me ? Well , I could buy you dinner . ( CHUCKLES ) Wow . That sounded totally sincere , thank you . How about this ? Your partners are heading to Leith . Get me a seat on Lucy when they do . Why do you need my help for that ? Because Dutch doesn 't like me and she 'll say no if I ask . ( CHUCKLES ) Get me a ride , help me pick up supplies at the Bazaar , and I will sign that psych eval for you when we 're back . Deal ? I 'll talk to John , make it happen . Good . Do you want some pain meds for your head ? Actually , you got any , um ... Copazenol ? It helps me sleep . I 'm all out . FOREMAN : All right , new pickers , welcome to the farm . Behave yourselves there , work hard ... OVERSEER : Right there . ... you 'll leave here with a year 's worth of Joy . Move it up . Next ! What is that ? It 's insurance . So you 're not tempted to overstay your visa . ( GROANS ) Move . Next ! FOREMAN : You work sun up to sun down . No excuses . DUTCH : So , Johnny got himself in as a migrant worker . Should be settled on Martell 's farm by now . Should be ? Farm rules . Data blackout for all migrants , so he deactivated his com . Well , I looked into this Martell fella 's shop . Looks clean . No workers AWOL for six seasons . But a whole lot of farm accidents and work-related deaths . Probably self-inflicted . I 'd kill myself if I had to farm all day . ( LAUGHS ) The cover you wanted . Won 't stand up to much poking around , but this warrant ain 't worth my extra effort . You sure it 's worth yours ? Seems to mean a lot to Johnny . Why ? DUTCH : Ever since his brother showed up , John 's been off his game . He needs a win . So , John 's looking low and I 'll be looking high , as a Hokk distributor working for The Nine . My lady . Bedros Martell . It 's an honor to have you as a guest at my humble Hokkery . Not too humble , I hope , or I 'm wasting my time . We only import the best . I 've prepared my finest room for you . If there 's anything I can do to make your stay more pleasurable ... Fetch my luggage . That would be a good start . ( SCOFFS ) You Okay ? This moon 's just too damn hot . Take it easy . Hey , Westy . Fresh off the transport , huh ? How did you know ? They don 't pay us to " take it easy . " Yeah , well , I had a drinking buddy in Old Town that told me this was the farm to crew if I ever wanted an easy job and fresh air . ( SCOFFS ) You know Vincent Sh 'ao ? 'Cause I could really kick his ass right about now . They don 't pay us to talk , either . ( GROANS ) Hey , getup ! Or we 'll dock a day 's wages ! He needs water . Easy , easy , easy . Got ourselves a runner ! Activate the tracker ! ( GROANS ) JOHN : What the hells ? OVERSEER : New people , pay attention . That is the kind of accident that happens when you break your work permit ! Stay in the zone . Now , get back to work . What about " undercover " didn 't you understand ? Calm down , I was careful . Wow . Nice . You definitely got the better gig . ( SIGHS ) Gross . Please get off my bed . They make us sleep on Hokk leaves . Who does that ? John , you smell like Lucy 's septic system , and that is 3,000 count Qreshi delta linen . So , get off my bed . Tell me what you 've found . Not Vincent . But I did discover Martell 's innovative worker retention program . They jam one of these puppies into us . What 's that ? Ow . It 's an incendiary tracking device . They remove it on the transport home , but until then , step out of the designated zone and ... ( IMITATES EXPLOSION ) That 's great news . That I have a tracking bomb in my ear ? Thanks . That Vince has . Can you get into whatever system Martell tracks his migrants with ? Why do you think I 'm here ? To ruin my bed and steal my bonbons ? You know , you 're just role-playing a Qreshi bitch , Dutch . You don 't have to actually be one . ( BEEPS ) JOHN : Can 't get access . It 's eye scan only . Then I 'll get us an eye . Not literally . Meet me tonight . I need a minimum fifty doses . But I 'll take more if you 're feeling generous . Sorry , I can 't help you . I 'm just an herbalist . PAWTER : Come on . We both know you sell more than just herbs . You want Linaria root ? I can sell you that . Please . I 'm losing 10 children a month to Pleuroxis . I need your help . Ask me , the best thing for the Quad is fewer Westerlyns . Come on , we 'll get it somewhere else . ( GROANS ) Have you heard of Selius Fever ? It 's nasty stuff . Pawter . You want the inoculation ? Let 's trade . D 'AVIN : Nice try . Get the doctor what she wants . Slowly . Not a word . Do it . Here . This will cleanse your palate . Where did you get that ? The big house . You went inside ? Why should they get all the fancy stuff ? ( CHUCKLES ) I haven 't had real cocoa since I was a child . Thank you . Mmm . So , what brings you to Leith ? Like I said , sun , fresh air , Joy . The usual . You 're not exactly the usual . I 'm not ? No . You 're either really brave or really dumb . Well , I don 't want to live in a world where I have to choose . Seriously , why leave ? I came to the Quad on a stolen ship with nothing in my pockets . The only place that would take me was Westerley . But I hate living there and I definitely don 't want to die there . You 're thinking of running ? Not after what I saw today . Good . Running never works . Is that what happened to Vince ? He tried to run , and now he 's fertilizing the Hokk ? Well , if you know Vincent , you 'd know he 's smarter than that . Does your family have much land left ? On Qresh ? By the time my father was of age , most of it had submerged . He was the youngest , so he got a one-way trip to Leith and a parcel of land . Which now produces some of the finest Hokk in the Quad . My investors are very interested in importing if they like what I see . Our Hokk recipe is my invention . And I 've dealt with my share of swindlers and spies along the way . Many thinking themselves quite clever . But there 's one thing cleverness can 't get you . Taste . Hmm . We 'll start with a young Shiro . Peppery , with hints of citrus . And if I 'm not mistaken , vanilla . But this Shiro has been aged at least two years . ( CHUCKLES ) Two years , three months . Your palate is refined , Seyah . As is my generous host . I 'd never know you for a Leithian . Shall we try a vintage Gorudo ? And waste a perfectly good bottle ? You 're touching me . ( CHUCKLES ) Trust me . We 'll have more fun drinking this . Permission to touch you , my lady . Granted . Permission to take your clothes off . That 's quite the burn . That ? It 's nothing . And what about these bruises ? Are they nothing ? What highborn Qreshi woman has these scars ? Feel that ? That 's from being tied with bansa knots . And this is from a long night and an even longer whip . We of The Nine like to play rough . How rough ? ( GRUNTS ) ( MARTELL LAUGHS ) How much can you take , you dirty Leithian ? ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) More . ( LAUGHS ) Ah , I 've always wanted to make a highborn woman scream . Have you ever experienced a Qreshi two-hander ? Show me . Close your eyes . Sweet dreams . ( BEEPS AND WHIRRS ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Welcome back , Bedros Martell . Track me Vincent Sh 'ao . Tether it to my guest 's personal device . Got you . ( GROANS ) Log out . Shut down . You became overstimulated . It happens the first time . ( GRUNTS ) Wait , did we finish ? Thank you for a very enjoyable evening . Was it good ? ( SIGHS ) PAWTER : Relax . She can 't report us . Do you have any idea what the penalty is for selling black-market meds ? And do you have any idea what the penalty is for armed robbery and assault with a deadly pathogen ? That was water . You think I 'm crazy ? A little , yeah . I 've been told that by saner men than you , D 'avin Jaqobis . You knew you were going to rob her . You used me . Oh , right , like you haven 't been playing me ? " I can buy you dinner . " Look at my manly muscles . ( SIGHS ) " Please sign my psych form . " All right , all right . Guilty . Look , I really did need those meds , okay ? Pleuroxis was barely a cold when I grew up on Qresh . On Westerley it 's a death sentence because no one can afford the damn pills . Not okay . So what took you to Westerley ? Need . As soon as people heard there was a Doctor around , they started lining up , and they haven 't stopped since . Westerlyns get a raw deal in the Quad . I try and balance it when I can . Your turn . Why are you here ? ( FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING ) PAWTER : Midnight celebration . Harvest tradition . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Yeah , we should head back to Lucy . No . Watch . ( FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING ) ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) D 'avin . It 's okay . All right , Vincent . Come out , come out , ( TRACKER BEEPING ) wherever you are . ( TRACKER BEEPING LOUDLY ) Oh , damn . Well , this just got creepy . What do you think ? Workers chopping and running , or serial killer with an ear fetish ? Either way , why hasn 't Martell reported them missing ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Whatever it is , all breadcrumbs lead to that forest outside the security zone . Agreed . I 'll call D 'avin in for backup . Go with him at first light . D 'avin , seriously ? I 'm ... I 'm literally standing right here . Your head will literally go boom if you leave the grounds . D 'avin 's standing by at the Leith market . Fine . But I got in tight with this migrant worker , Shyla . Now , I think that she knows what 's going on . So just give me a day to work that angle , get some intelligence ... No . ( SCOFFS ) I 'm sorry , are you not letting me ? Again , John , bomb in your head . I don 't want you painting an unnecessary target on yourself . D 'avin and I will handle it , and that 's final . Whatever you say ... Boss . Johnny , don 't be a shit . D 'avin Jaqobis . Fearless , decisive . Has what it takes to be a Killjoy . He 's also hyper-violent , has trouble sleeping , occasionally cannot distinguish between civilian life and battle . My diagnosis , stress response syndrome . You triggered me on purpose . I 'm sorry , I was doing my job . The signs were there , I just needed to be sure . Want to know what I 've observed , Illenore Pawter Simms ? Messiah complex . Fraud . You 're on Westerley the same reason as the rest of us , 'cause you have nowhere to go . Nice . But you can 't drive me away that easy . The Company threatened to suspend your medical license unless you left Qresh . Banishment ? Damn , Doc . What did you do ? Where did you hear that ? Killjoys have access to all kinds of fun files . Just doing my job . Like you said , you 're not a Killjoy . Not until I sign off on you . I 'll find my own ride home . Hey , brave and dumb . Still enjoying the fresh air ? Actually , I just came to say goodbye . What ? Harvesting Hokk isn 't for me . We 're not slaves . I can quit if I want , as long as I go straight back to Westerley . Yeah , and they can make sure you don 't see a single Joy , and that you pay for your transport back out of your own pocket . Or lock you up for the debt . ls that what you want ? Okay , truth . I didn 't come here to pick Hokk . Now , Vince said there was more to this place . If he lied , then I 'm gone . But if not , I want in . Why are you telling me ? Because I know that you 're involved . Now , whatever it is , I 'm ready for it . One-way ride . You do this , there 's no coming back . So just how brave and dumb are you ? ( EXHALES ) LUCY : Incoming call from Dutch . Go ahead , Dutch . Has John been in touch ? D 'AVIN : No , Why ? ( TRACKER BEEPING ) I wanted to apologize about something this morning . Couldn 't find him , and none of the other workers have seen him . I 'm tracking his ear tag . What 's he done now ? Oh , no . Oh , Johnny Jaqobis , tell me you didn 't ... ( GASPS ) SHYLA : So , I came to Leith , prepared to work myself into an early grave . And I met Vincent and he showed me a new way . So , you go back and forth between the farm and the forest ? To find other Westerlyns who refuse to be defined by the world they were born on . Or assigned to . People who have what it takes . To do what ? Follow me . Crazy , ear-chopping son of a bitch . Lucy , ready engines . LUCY " . Engines ready . Dutch , I 'm coming in hot . D 'AVIN : And leveling the forest until we find him . Easy , soldier . Stay ready , but leave it with me . You might want to put those down . And you might want to tell me who the hell you really are . Most Hokk distributors I know don 't pack this kind of weapon . Who are you with ? Killjoy . On an official warrant . I guess the migrant worker that broke in here and attacked you was too stupid to know any better . Pity about the blood on my nice rugs . MARTELL : Do it . ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey ! I don 't have time for this . ( BOTH GROANING ) How about your rug , your blood ? ( GROANS ) What do you want ? I wanted a holiday . I have a lot I 'm dealing with right now , so unless you want me to vent my frustration by frying the crap out of you , tell me , where 's my partner ? SHYLA : Everyone . Meet John , our new friend . You brought me to a Jakk grow op ? DUTCH " . Where 's John ? I have no idea what the hell you 're talking about . ( YELLS ) ( CRACKLING ) Does that help ? He went looking for Vincent Sh 'ao . Vincent 's not here . He 's out in the woods . Doing what ? Running a Jakk grow op . ( GROANS ) Where 's the grow op ? I could tell you , but you don 't want to go there . And why 's that ? When you hacked my system , I thought you were here to bust me , so I contacted the authorities and expressed my absolute shook at finding a Jakk grow op running under my nose . Plausible deniability , nice . How long do I have ? Before the defoliation ships arrive ? In an hour that forest will be a dead zone . And if he 's out there , your partner will be , too . ( GROANS ) VINCENT : That him ? SHYLA : Yeah , he says he knows you . VINCENT : Oh , really ? Look , I can explain . ( GRUNTING ) Look , I 'm just here to bring you home . I am home . VINCENT : Here 's the danger in telling lies . Someone always knows the truth . So , unless you want a bullet to the head , old drinking buddy , you 're going to tell me who you are . I 'm a Killjoy . I 've got a warrant to take you back to Westerley before your visa expires . That is all . Who put out the warrant ? N 'oa , his wife . JOHN : You remember her ? I didn 't know she cared so much . JOHN : She kind of has to . She co-signed your work contract . If you go AWOL , she does your time , and I 'm not going to let that happen . Yeah , well , I 'm not going back to Westerley . N 'oa should have made better choices . Now I 've got to get rid of you . You really don 't want to do that . The RAC will hunt you down . VINCENT ; The RAC ? By the time they find your body , I 'll be long gone . You brought him in , you put him down . Let 's go . Get up . Up ! Get here , D 'avin . Get here now . Hang in . Almost there . I 'm sorry , John . I really am . You really should be . ( COUGHING ) JOHN : Don 't move . I 'm going after Vincent . LUCY : In range for landing . Good . Locate Dutch 's position and bring us down as close as you can . ( ALARM BEEPING ) I don 't know all your beeps yet , Lucy . What does that mean ? Congested airfield . There are other ships heading to our destination . That 's not good . John . Hey , Dutch . Where 's D 'avin ? What the hell happened here ? John Jaqobis happened . DUTCH : Okay , you 're amazing . We need to go now . ( RUMBLING ) What 's that sound ? Defoliation ships . Martell ratted out the operation to the authorities . Okay . I 'm ready . You can take me home . No . SHYLA : We stay and fight . We 'll shoot at their ships , drive them off . Buy enough time to save the crop . If you stay , you die . Come with us . Back to Old Town ? Prison ? Go to hell . I fight for what 's mine . You got a warrant for me , not her . Take me . He 's right , John . If she wants to stay , that 's her choice . Have it your way . JOHN : Keep up , Vincent ! D 'AVIN : Those ships are dropping payload . You got about 10 seconds . Hustle ! Ten , nine ... ( ALARM BEEPING ) JOHN : D 'av , we can count . Vince , haul your ass ! LUCY : Toxin dispersal ship approaching . Get in . Come on . ( GRUNTS ) Come on . VINCENT : Congratulations . I 'm back on Westerley . Your warrant 's complete . You want to get rid of these things ? Thank you so much for the ride . LUCY : John , your guest has arrived . Much appreciated . Hmm . Vincent ? N 'oa . Baby . Oh . That was so close . N 'OA : I missed you . Did you miss me ? Are you kidding me ? I thought about you every night . I owe you my life . ( GROANS ) I hope you think about me every night the next 10 years , you pathetic , wannabe , planet-hopping ass . I like her . N 'OA : He 's all yours , Johnny . Baby . Wait . Vincent Sh 'ao , it gives me , well , ( LAUGHS ) let 's be honest , great pleasure to inform you that you are so locked , and incredibly served . This is horseshit . Your warrant was to bring me back here , and I 'm here ! Unfortunately , your off-world permit expired an hour outside of Westerlyn air space . Johnny , did we take the scenic route ? We did . And I feel terrible about that . See , the Company 's charged you with illegal emigration . Issued a new warrant even before we landed , Jakkhole . So have fun serving your time at the bottom of a mine . ( CHUCKLES ) You should have made better choices . ( GRUNTS ) If you ask me , it looks a little large . I 'd shut up before she takes off your other ear . Yeah . It 's going to be a while before I can fit you in , so if I were you , I would go get really , really , really drunk . This is going to hurt , isn 't it ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'll come find you when I 'm ready . I know I 'm supposed to say something to make things better . Say you 're sorry . You could start with that . I 'm sorry . And for the record , I don 't care why you left Qresh . It 's none of my business . Do you like living this way ? No . Then do something about it . D 'avin , you don 't add up . You 're taking Copazenol , you say to help you sleep . But Copazenol is a very strong neurological medication . Who prescribed it to you ? Some army doc . What was she treating you for ? Honestly can 't remember . Read it . You 're passing me . Because we had a deal , and I keep my word . Look , if you care at all about yourself or your team , you need to get help . Stress response syndrome doesn 't just go away . It takes treatment and ... Okay . Okay ? Yeah . What about you ? Can you treat me ? Why ? I don 't like most doctors . I like you . What 's in it for me ? Pumpkin beers . Pree saved us a couple . Disobeying orders , cutting off your ear . What 's going on with you , Jaqobis ? You first . Strange red box , mystery burns , asking D 'av to join our team without asking me first . He 's your brother . I thought you 'd be happy . Of course I 'm happy . So then what 's the problem ? It 's complicated . For once , I had something that I was amazing at . I had a partner that I loved working with . And then , he just comes in and he starts D 'avin-ing all over it . ( LAUGHS ) They started him at a Level Four , I 'm allowed to be conflicted for a day . His Level Four is nothing compared to the six years we 've had each other 's backs . If you 're worried about being replaced , don 't be . You 're ... Irreplaceable to me . ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Thank you . I like when you use your words . Look , if you ever want him gone , he 's gone . You can 't make your brother-crap our crap . I know . You have to deal with that . I will . Soon . Because he 'll probably just leave again once he finds that doctor he 's tracking . ( SIGHS ) Now you going to tell me what 's going on with you ? If I tell you it 's over , can we let that be enough ? Okay . But no more secrets . No more secrets . Tap my heart . Good . ( EXHALES ) Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to go see a girl about an ear .

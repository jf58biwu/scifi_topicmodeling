 Why don 't they make trains like this anymore ? Our generation 's not allowed to have nice things . Time for another . Never thought I 'd say this , but these make me miss the heroin . - God , I miss ... - this . Me , too . Life on beta blockers ... is no life at all . What ? - We 're not alone . - From last night ? Aye , from last night . Though what drove me to such recklessness , I can 't say . - I 'm Riley and this is Will . - Oh , nice try . But you can just call me ... the Old Man of Hoy . What 's his name ? He doesn 't trust us . Of course I don 't trust you . I barely escaped with my frontal lobes from your wee disco . So did we . It seems like you took your blockers at the same time we took ours . Aye , maybe it 's true that you got out like me by the hair on your chinny-chin . Or maybe , just maybe , you were supposed to get out . He thinks the concert was a BPO trap . I 've seen more than my fair share of snares . You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind . Now , whether I 'm right or wrong about you , I suspect we 'll be seeing each other again soon enough . He 's gone . I have to go . I know . I prepared this . Food , some clothes , money . I do not know how to thank you . Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher . Sometimes , I find her staring at the gate . I know she 's waiting for you . I promise I will come back . We will be here . - I 'm starving , but ... - But what ? You were out all day , you slept on the couch ... Are you mad at me ? No . Or me ? I 've been mad at many things these days . Mostly myself . No , it 's my fault . It 's ... I push too much . - I get too excited about things . - No , no , no . No , this is on me . I shouldn 't have made an issue out of the letter . No one needs to apologize . Please , Dani , sit . Thank God ! It smells so freaking good ! I did it again , didn 't I ? We love how excited you get . We do . Family , I have something very important to say . This is my mother 's special omelet . She would cook this for my father whenever he was missing Spain . You both know me well enough to know that when I am upset , I cannot listen to anyone or anything . Oh , yeah . But last night , I heard a voice ... and that voice was speaking to me as clear as a bell . What did it say ? It said , " Pack your bags , family . " " Because we 're going to São Paulo ! " Yes ! - You . - What do you mean ? Hello . - Hello . - I 'm ... looking for some courage . I heard I had a visitor at the office the other day . - I shouldn 't have come . - No . The guys you met are assholes . They 're sons of the rich who play at journalism because it makes for a good chat-up line . Believe me , your left thumb has more value - than the three of them all together . - Thanks . They told me that when you were at college ... you ... Yes , I loved a woman . It 's true . I 've also loved men . I fall in love with the person , not their genitals . Which may sound weird to you . No . Not at all . Look , I 'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card , but ... lately , I 've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be . Which is the part where I may need some courage . I 've not felt so lucky since I met you . What are you doing ? Trying to be brave . I 've never dated anyone who owned so many books . I 've never dated anyone who drove a matatu . We do live in different worlds . Not tonight we don 't . When I 'm with you ... all the rules ... and the logic of everyday life ... things that were so important to me ... all go away . And all I feel ... is how fast my heart beats ... whenever I 'm with you . Are you sure ? Not too bad for a machine , huh ? What ? You just push a button and ... this ? This is a miracle . Good morning . Thank you . I love our coffee . It 's one of the few things Kenya does really well . In England , I missed it . Yes , but they have really good tea . You 've been to England ? I 've seen many movies . - You hungry ? - Yes . Good morning , my love . I have to get to work . Last night was a dream come true . See you later . So they came to my house , they talked to me about it , and they left . Wait , you 're telling me the DRP actually came to your door - and asked you to run on their ticket ? - Yeah . Crazy , right ? And you haven 't met with them again ? I 'm sorry , I thought you would find the story funny . I 've interviewed Koman Nyagah . He 's a serious and very intelligent man . Why wouldn 't you meet with him ? Zakia , I 'm a matatu driver . Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you . I was at the protest . I saw the look on their faces . They trusted you , Capheus . It 's ridiculous . I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity . We say there 's nothing as expensive as being poor . Why ? Because our government , like every other government , doesn 't care about poor people or places like Kibera . But you do . - Zakia , I 'm ... - At the very least , you can agree to meet with them . Hear them out . Lito ! - That 's a big welcome . - Hello . Lito Rodriguez ! - Hello . - Hello . Oh , my God . How are you ? Hello . - Thank you ! - My God ! I 'm one of your biggest fans ! - Thank you very much . - Oh , where ... Oh , yes . - I love you so much ! - Thank you . There is a schedule of events in your packet . Okay . The parade kicks off after your address . My address ? Only if you want . It is for you to decide . - Okay . - Okay . - Lito ! - Lito Rodriguez ! - Hello . - Hello . Thank you very much . Thank you . - Can you take a selfie ? - Yes . - Thank you ! - It 's our pleasure . Hey , Van Damn . Hey , your son is here . Hey , I saw you on YouTube . You are amazing , just amazing . But be careful , Van Damn , people are noticing . Well , uh ... Hello , Mom . Hello , son . Hmm ... I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there . It would appear neither of us spent the night at home , again . - Should I be worried ? - No . Should I ? I 'm surprised . You don 't think your mother can turn a head anymore ? - My mother is as beautiful as ever . - Then why ? Kenyan men ... we both know they 're not very open-minded . That 's true . So ... a little surprising . Not as much as you think . Did you ever wonder why Silas had such easy access to the drugs that I needed ? We both have the virus . And what 's more , he told me that very soon , they may have a cure . Now why are you crying ? Because I sometimes forget that ... life 's not just full of surprises . It 's also full of gifts . Yes . Oh , man . What ? It 's amazing . Whole underground world of abandoned places people use like their hotel rooms . It 's more like camping . The same rules , you try to leave it better than how you found it . If I had a good show , I 'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere . - Like what ? - Mm ... Money . Drugs . Music . Where did you get those ? Train station . Thought we could use them to cover the windows . Confuse anyone dropping in . Have I mentioned how in love with you I am ? It really isn 't the same , is it ? Well ... it 's not bad . It could be the way that older couples who 've been together a long time feel like when they kiss . Yeah , I like the idea of a long life spent kissing you . Mm-hm . Eh ... this is some stomach-churning domesticity . Seriously . This is factory-farming shit . Oh , no . Another visitor ? Did the blockers wear off early ? Take your complaint to the FDA , mate . - It 's Puck . - From the lab ? Oh , sharp as a bowling ball . I don 't understand . If you 're a sensate , why didn 't we connect ? - Three guesses . - Must 've been on blockers when we met . Ding . Bowling ball continues to impress . Hey , ask him how he avoids BPO . Oh ! Ask him if you and I can have just a quick fuck . What did he say ? - He 's not being very helpful . - Why , am I supposed to be ? At Vincent 's , you knew what blockers were and you didn 't tell me . - Oh , I told you enough . - Tell him that we need help . If nothing changes , if no one figures out how to stop BPO , then one day he 's gonna need the same kind of help . Over here , hero . Free advice : if you bump into one of our kind , assume that they are BPO collaborators . Be particularly suspicious if you hear about their daring escape from The Rock in Iceland , while also appearing live on stage at an underground EDM concert . He doesn 't trust us either . - Can you blame me ? - Why come to the concert ? What can I say ? The dick wants what the dick wants . Sex ... can be such a good trust-builder . I don 't think so . Oh ... Hard To Get dot com . That is my domain . Give me a call when you get bored of you-know-who . Can you tell me where you get your blockers ? I make them myself , puttanella . Listen , the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck . But lucky you seem to already have yours , the latest ones with less side effects . Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO . Wait . Blockers aren 't gonna keep you safe forever , Riley Blue . Not from BPO . And not from me . What did he say ? I think I just picked up the equivalent of a sensate STD . Whoo ! Let them gloat . Hey , Monsieur Gorilla , where 's the ball ? Where did the ball go ? Oh , it 's in your goal ! Come on , Felix , stop trash-talking . Let 's play ! Wolfie ! Here ! Where are you ? Here ! Ah ! - Hey , you all right ? - I 'm fine . - That 's what I 'm talking about ! - You all right ? - You all right ? - Everybody , calm down ! Come on ! Stand up ! That 's what I 'm talking about ! That was fucking real ! Do you have to do everything so intensely ? No . Just the things that matter . Oh ... These are the last year reports from the controller general . Yeah , you can just put them there . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Um ... About last night ... I ... needed you and you were there for me . But it was wrong . Why ? You know why . You weren 't in my bed any more than I 'm sitting on this desk here . It 's in our heads , like a fantasy . Last night was not a fantasy . What 's true is that married women like to fantasize . - It 's what keeps marriages together . - No . I don 't . I ... I must not . Okay , you 're in Bombay , I 'm in Berlin . I think you 're safe . Please . Last night made me realize that I can 't be trusted with my thoughts . Come on , Wolfie ! Let 's finish Fuchs ' Fucks ! I need help and you have to help me . I 'm trying to make a life . Hmm . Pretending isn 't a life . - Wolfie ! - Yeah ! Coming ! So ... big day tomorrow . Do you know what you 're gonna say ? What ... Do you think I should say something ? You don 't have to do it if you don 't feel comfortable . Yes . Absolutely . But ... you 're so good when you speak from your heart . Baby , the interview you did at the premiere was incredible . I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you . Of course . I mean , it has over a million views . - Really ? - You haven 't watched it ? I 'm banned from social media . You just love to look at the bad stuff . - Yeah , that is true . - Mm-hmm . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Look ! Look ! Now ... a man who needs no introduction , but I 'll introduce to you anyhow . I give you the Grand Marshall of this year 's Pride Parade ... Lito Rodriguez ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , São Paulo ! Thank you . I wanted to say that I am very honored to be here . That isn 't the truth . To be honest with you , I ... I have never been as scared as I am right now . All of my life , I 've had to pretend to be something I wasn 't . And to become what I wanted to become ... I couldn 't be what I am . I am a gay man . I 've never said those words in public before . I am a gay man ! I am a gay man ! I am a gay man ! Oh . Why did I have to be so afraid to say that ? Because I know that people are afraid of people that are different from them . And admitting that I am different and refusing to pretend to be something I am not , may cost me a career of pretending to be things that I am not , which is kind of crazy when you think about it . But I did . I did . For years , I was living inside the fake world of a movie set , never daring to imagine that one day ... I might be brave enough to do something like this . Come with me . Hi . This is Hernando . He is the love of my life . I am a better and braver person because of him . And whatever it costs for me to be able to do this ... I know in my heart that it is worth it . And now , let 's party ! That was fun . It was . - Last time we were here ... - we both felt trapped . You were afraid of going to prison . Now I miss it . You wanted so badly to see your father . And you felt like you were making a terrible mistake . We 've switched places . Which means , in a way , we 're in the same place . Is there a way out of this ? Or is this just how life always feels ? So you 've had no other issues with that brain syndrome thing ? Oh , no , not any health issues . Everything has been fine . That is such a relief . I told Tom I am so happy that you 're gonna be there after what happened last year . Me , too . Even though I know Mom and Dad must be giving you hell for this . No . They 're okay . Come on , T , don 't lie . What did Dad say ? He said I would regret it . But why ? I can take it . Because he said that your narcissism is a black hole and that you would do something to make my wedding all about you . But I told him he was wrong , and more importantly , I couldn 't imagine getting married without my sister being there . Come here . Oh , I love you . Thank you for sticking up for me . I won 't let you down , and if you need anything ... Actually , there is one thing I could really use some help on ... Nom ! It 's the cabin ! - What ? - I emailed Abrasax Electronics . They found an old shipping report and , oh , my God ! - What ? - It 's up near Dancing Water . - That 's weird . - What 's Dancing Water ? Um , that 's the commune where Neets grew up . - Um ... - Mom is gonna freak ! - Okay , we gotta get up there . - I 'm sure she 'll want to come . - I 'm gonna text her . Bye , sweetie . - Bye . I 'm ... I love you . But I gotta ... I gotta go . Okay , just call me . Come on , sleepy . The world isn 't going to save itself . Daddy , look what I made ! Now this line describing the flank , that is sublime . Come , let Daddy get dressed . Good morning , Milton . Good morning , Mr. Secretary . The Chairman is very excited . It 's a very big day for us . - It is . - We are counting on you . How are you feeling ? Are you all right ? Something 's about to happen . Something bad . Ah ! What the fuck ? I was bored . Don 't bother on my account . Where have you been ? Did you miss me ? I know you want to tell her to fuck off , but we need information . You use blockers . Everyone does . - Where do you get them from ? - My contact . - Does he have a name ? - Yeah . " My Business . " I thought you said we could help each other . Not that . Ask something else . Show her the picture . Do you know who this guy is ? - Walk away , Lila . - Hmm ? You do know him . Walk away now . Love to talk , but my date 's arrived . I wouldn 't . - Why ? - Two of the goons were rentals . They 'll go in , sweep the room , then head back out here . Ah ... Ms. Facchini . Mr. Bohm . I was hoping it 'd be you . Why ? Fuchs doesn 't see what you are . He doesn 't know . But I do . You are just like me . You 're in luck ... Was he right about you ? If you 're trying to find a difference between us , you 're wasting your time . I 'm not the one with a leash around my neck . Lila , why are you still talking to him ? I know what I 'm doing . You said we needed each other , but as soon as I ask you for something , you walk away . Be smart . - How long has he been after you ? - A year . - A year ? - That has to be a lie . - Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow . - The Cannibal ? Clustercide . Story is he ate his own . - Do you know his real name ? - No one does . Someone must . This cluster is dead . Is this one of yours ? Yeah . He thought you were as hot as I do . But right now , all he thinks is that you 're lying . What do you think ? We 'll see . You know , you never think about how ubiquitous immigrant food like General Tso 's chicken and pepperoni pizza has become ... Until you realize you 're a different human species on the run from an evil organization trying to lobotomize you ? Exactly . Did we make a mistake doing the concert ? No . It just proved there 's a whole bunch more of us out there than we thought , and that there must be some kind of an intelligence network because they all seemed to know who you were . We just have to try and figure out a way to get them to trust us . Aye , that 's the rub , laddie . Mr. Hoy is back . What a charming little empty box you 've chosen here . All the modern amenities of a prison cell . Where are you visiting from ? I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here . Soundproofing . Eighteen inches thick . All the modern amenities of a coffin . Aye . So , Miss Blue , if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters , putting on your show was a terrible risk . Care to explain what possessed you ? Well , Mr. Hoy , if you 're not a BPO headhunter , then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk . - What possessed you ? - Huh ... Maybe ... after 30 years of surviving ... not living , mind you , but surviving ... maybe after 30 years of blockers , and coffins , and boxes ... maybe I realized ... I 'm slowly dying of survival . I 'm sick of this . - I 'm done playing by the rules . - What are you doing ? - What 's going on ? - Mr. Hoy needs a reason to trust us . There you are , Mr. Hoy . Aye , well , you do not need to be Sherlock Holmes . If you 're a headhunter or looking to make a deal with BPO , you know where to find me . Ach ! You 've gone and done it now , Miss Blue . You 've done it now . I 'm not about to be out-trusted by a DJ from Iceland . With hair the color of a Smurf ! Come on now , Miss Blue . Let 's get out of here . Come on , Miss Blue ! My library . And this is my laboratory . This way . Welcome to the Highlands of Scotland , Miss Blue . It 's beautiful . Reminds me of home . Dinner 's ready . Aye , just a moment . Has another of your invisible friends dropped by ? Aye , Kirsty . This is Miss Blue . She 's from Iceland . A lady invisible friend , is it ? Well , now , there 's a turn-up for the book . Invite her in . There 's stovies and mushy peas , and fried Mars bar for dessert . She 's lovely . She 's a sweet old bird , all right . - Is she family ? - More than most . She was the wife of one of my cluster . I was with him when he died . He asked me to take care of her . But the funny thing is , I think I 'm looking after her , and she thinks she 's looking after me . But who 's to know who 's right , eh ? This is where the dads said it should be . I really love your dads . Just the fact that they all wanted to take care of you and be a part of your life . People used to give me shit when I used to use all three of their names on my school forms . But I think I knew I was pretty lucky in the dad department . Do you think what my dad said about me to Teagan is true ? That you 're a black hole of narcissism ? Look , most of us either have our heads stuck in the sand or stuck up our own ass . It 's human nature to think our problems are the only problems . Neets ... God , I 'm sorry . I 've been ... let 's be generous and say not entirely myself and focused on many other things . You mean besides your amazing girlfriend ? Who 's been beyond amazing . Like , approaching saint status . I would look good as a statue . I 'm serious . I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you . What ? It 's her . Angelica ? Spring of ' 52 . A very , very covert conference was convened at the British airbase on Cyprus . Authorities from NATO , the Warsaw Pact , China , and the Arab League sat locked in a room debating reality . After weeks of haggling , walk-outs , and bullying , the Biologic Preservation Organization was born . How do you know all of this ? I was there . I assisted Ruth El-Saadawi in drafting the initial charter and guidelines for research into sensacity . Signatories guaranteed human rights to sensoriums and agreed not to deploy them for military needs . That 's Ruth there . Is that you ? Handsome bugger , eh ? Where did it all go ? This is crazy cool . It 's exactly what I read in that book by the woman who started BPO . - Ruth El-Saadawi . - Yes . She talked about psycellium as a morphogenic field and how it made connections like the synapses in our brain , storing them the way memories are stored . She 's the mother of this claid . - What 's a claid ? - A cluster . Sequoias are like us , polypliotic . - Can you still see her ? - Yeah . She lived here . The cabin is beautiful . - She looks so different . - How do you mean ? She looks happy . Why didn 't the charter just announce to the world that Homo sensoriums exist ? Look , we all know sapiens . I mean , some of my best friends are sapiens . When sapiens feel safe , they 're the nicest people you could meet . However , feed their inner demons , frighten them , find reasons for them to divide themselves from otherness , and then watch those selfsame sapiens drop bombs on whole cities , drive planes into buildings and happily herd millions of their own kind into gas chambers . And that 's just what they would do to each other . What wouldn 't they do to a totally different species ? That 's why Ruth herself advocated total secrecy . Was Ms. El-Saadawi a sensate ? No , but her twin sister was . They came from a village in Egypt . Not long after her sister 's cluster birth , she was stoned to death for immorality and witchcraft . Ruth went from being a doctor one day to a crusader the next , and did everything she could to prevent it from happening to someone else 's sister . If she was alive today ... she 'd look at what BPO has become and she would weep . Wait . - What ? - Something 's wrong . The research might be helpful . That 's what the Nazis said ! You fucking hide out in Walden while they herd the rest of us into cattle cars . Do you think they might be right ? I 'll go to Iceland . She 's fighting with her cluster . Be careful . Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters ? Do you know him ? If he 's the one that 's after you , I must say , I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage . What 's his real name ? I don 't know myself . Not sure I want to know . When our kind have nightmares about BPO , they 're usually about him . - Where do I find him ? - Huh ! I do not ken where you get your brass goolies from , but maybe I 'll be able to give you what you want . But fair warning , it comes with a price , like as not . I 'll pay it . There 's a network of us , strung out about the world . The Archipelago , we 're called . Isolated above , but connected below . I ask someone I know , who asks someone they know , who asks ... Well , you get the gist . Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s . We 've had it since the Neolithic . How long does it take ? I 'm looking for Cannibal . Get him on the phone now ! I don 't know what he thinks he 's doing . This is my research , this is my project . Tell him I 'm gonna straighten him out ! I 've got the answer , but I don 't think you 're going to like it . I was getting nervous . I 'm all right . I learned a lot . About BPO and how it changed over the years . There 's someone on the inside who knows Whispers . Did you get a name ? - Not yet . - Why not ? Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago . But I have to go alone . Nom ! Dr. Metzger . I don 't know what they taught you in med school , but the word " helping " doesn 't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains . Prep her for surgery . Nomi , what have you done ? Is he in there ? What is he doing ? I told you , he 's trying to destroy my work . I love you . You really believe that neurografting is possible ? God save us from this idiot . All that work lost . - What will we do now ? - I 'll start over . What happened ? I don 't know . But everything started to go wrong when Angelica ... went to Chicago .

 - MAN : Here he comes ! Mr. President ! - ( CHEERING ) JEFFREY : Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you very much . Six commandos in here . I counted four in the hallway . That goon over there in the blue shirt . With all the scruff , looking around ? He was on Solace . He recognizes me , we got problems . Sir , is that really the President ? Well , if everyone in the bunker 's really dead , yeah , he was next in line . - ( CHEERING CONTINUES ) - How are you ? Looks to me like he 's playing a part . His body language , expression , the way the two guys are up against him . Nice to meet you . He 's being held against his will . If they have him , and they can somehow piece the country together , get communications up , they 'll control everything . The federal reserve , the military . Well , that 's not gonna happen . Thank you very much . One way or another , we 're getting our Commander-ln-Chief out of here . ♪ ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ♪ ( PANTING ) Cover for me . - Need some help there , boss ? - Yeah , man , thanks . What is this place anyway ? - Lots of people , lots of mouths to feed . - Yeah ? It 's a go for Tiger team . Sir , we 've got Tiger . ( BEEPING ) ( LINE RINGS ) Green , tell me the CO 's standing with you ? That 's a negative , sir . No contact or visual with Vulture team . I 'm on a rooftop 500 yards north of your whiskey , Tiger . - What 's your con ops ? - Well , sir , we are improvising . All seems quiet in the compound . CO most likely got in undetected . Yeah , or he walked in and they pointed a gun to his head . What 's our rally point , Taylor ? There 's a baseball field a half a mile north of my whiskey . At 30.275 north , 81.462 west . Copy , 30.275 north , 81.462 west , ball field . - Big enough to land our helo . - That 's the idea . Roger , out . Find that . Green , you 've got company . Signing off . ( SNIFFS ) All right , boys ! Stack the boxes on the dollies and roll them toward the side door . All right . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) I got that one . This goes to the scientist . Whatever you say . Impressive work , my friend . This is more than I expected . Ah , when the message is true , people are sure to follow . Take care . ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( TRUCK DOOR CLOSES ) There 's still no contact with the sub . I 'm telling you it 's that destroyer . It 's probably a problem with the repeater . Ian knows he 's not supposed to talk to us direct . Or maybe they 're under attack . Maybe he 's sunk . If he 's sunk , he 's sunk . Nothing we can do about it now . - You can 't be serious . - Nothing we can do about it now . Got it ? Okay , brother . I got it . Right . The boys saw a few stragglers in that last supply run . They 're living in a trailer park in the 115 . Niels has got a new magic trick he wants to try . You 're gonna go with him . Get in that van . Go on . ( VAN DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) Sir , the rally point is here , just north of Jacksonville . We 'll be in range to launch our helo from here in about two hours depending on headwinds . Can 't launch from open water , not with the sub listening . You gotta find me a more protected spot . There 's the mouth of the St. John 's River . Uh , the land mass should be able to block our location if they try to ping us , but it 'll take an extra hour to get there , sir . OOD , set a new course for the mouth of the St. John 's River . - OOD , aye . Quiet one , sir ? - Yes . Helmsman , come left , steer course 325 . Activate prairie masker to conceal our frequencies . Hold at 12 knots . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) - Hey ! What are you doing over there ? - Uh , chill out , man . Just ... Taking a piss . - Well , get back to work . - You got it . ( SNIFFS ) - WOMAN : Hello , Mr. President . - Appreciate it . Thank you for being here . - MAN : Mighty grateful to you , sir . - Pleasure to meet you . MAN 2 : It is an honor and a pleasure , sir . - ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) - Thank you . - WOMAN 2 : Thank you , sir . - lt 's okay . ( STRAINING ) Oh , my goodness . Look at the size of this guy , huh ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) He 's a big kid . You are special , young man . You were chosen . Like all of us . Whatever we do , we need to do it fast . They 're moving the President tonight . - To New Orleans ? - Whoa . Where 'd you hear that ? Guard at the courtyard . Tossed my hair a bit . He gave up the goods . - Any contact with Green and Taylor ? - Negative , sir . Those trucks are going on a supply run . They could be anywhere by now . As long as your friend doesn 't come back from the Solace and make you , my exfil plan could work if we separate POTUS from the guards . We need to move fast , and he may need some convincing . You were wrong about his body language . He 's not a hostage . - He 's with them ? - There 's layers in these groups . - He may not know what the real agenda is . - I don 't know how deep in he is , but he has drunk some of the Kool-Aid , that 's for sure . We gotta do this quietly . If he 's here on his own will , that means he has power . If he has power , he can be manipulated . ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) There you are . - The repeater 's gone ? - Destroyed , like a pile of chum . - It had to be that ship . - We should alert the brothers . If we rise up with no sound matting , we might as well paint a bloody target on the side of our sub . It 's gonna take days to fix the matting . We can 't just sit down here with our thumbs up our asses . Enough . We ain 't heard from that ship in hours , man . We gotta be far enough away . Just ' cause we ain 't heard them don 't mean they aren 't out there . And that makes you the bloody expert , does it ? - Yes , you- - - Does it ? ( ALL ARGUING ) Enough ! Bloody hell ! A bloke can 't even think with all this ruckus . Shut it ! All of you ! Shut it ! You yellow-bellied , whiny wankers . I just ... I need to think . ( SQUEAKS ) ( EQUIPMENT WHIRRING ) This machine is very impressive , Dr. Scott . Well , it 's really thanks to Commander Garnett and Lieutenant Chung . I 've administered the virus - to these four mice . - ( MOUSE SQUEAKING ) And now ... It 's time to introduce them to the cure . ( WHIRS AND BEEPS ) And then we wait . ( MICE SQUEAKING ) ( MACHINE HISSES ) - So , all they have to do is breathe it in ? - Yes , all they have to do is breathe . It works very much like an inhaler . ( SQUEAKING ) - Are you sure ? - It was him . - He was experimenting on something . - Jesus . I thought we smoked that mofo on the Vyerni . Well , he 's back from the dead . - Hey , Pompano ! - Hey . - Time to roll . Load up . - Sweet . - Where we goin ' ? - A lot of people , a lot of mouths to feed . What 's with the motorcade ? I thought Sean wanted to keep this quiet . They don 't know what you 're up to , do they ? They 're here for the supply run . You 're just a pit stop on the way . Get in . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( CHEERING ) Mr. President . Good to meet you . Is that your bag , ma 'am ? - Is that your bag ? - No . This has been sitting there for about 20 minutes and I could swear I hear beeping coming from inside . Seeping ? Look , I don 't wanna be paranoid , but that 's the President , right ? Well , should we say something ? Bomb ! There 's a bomb in here ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . The doors are locked ! Hey ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! - Get out of my way ! ( GRUNTS ) - WOMAN : Get off of me . Sir , get down . Get down ! ( ALL SCREAMING AND YELLING ) - Mr. President . - There was a bomb scare upstairs . - What ? - It was just a knapsack . A woman panicked . - It was nothing . - It was not nothing . I could 've been trampled . Somebody in the crowd was able to get up right in my face . If he hadn 't stepped up and fought the guy off , who knows what would 've happened ? He certainly could 've got a shot off or stabbed me . So , you brought him up here ? What 's he want ? A trophy ? Easy , James . Manners . - Sean Ramsey . - Course , I know who you are . Well , thanks for your help . All right ? No disrespect , but , uh , here in the US of A , we use more than two guys to guard the President . And we never leave his side . You 're right . Giovanni , you 're on POTUS detail with these wankers . Make sure something like this never happens again . No , I want him . I want an American . - You got a name ? - Tommy . - Where you from , Tommy ? - Worked as a bodyguard in New York . I was protecting one of those teenage pop stars in Miami when the virus broke out . Next thing I know , people are dropping like flies , but I 'm still kicking . Wasn 't till I met one of your boys that ... I realized why . I was chosen . And your family ? ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Wife didn 't make it . - So how 'd you come to us then ? - Just got in on a bus from down south . Must 've ran into MacDowell then ? I was never really good with names . Man was a good speaker , though . So , you were chosen ? I know I was . So that must mean that this is where you 're supposed to be - at this very moment ? - Well , I don 't know about that . But if I were in the right place at the right time , let the chips fall . The chips fall . Welcome to the team , brother . ( EXHALES ) ( HAMMER CLICKS ) Tommy . You , stay close to him . ( GROANS ) ( EXHALES ) You okay ? He didn 't have to break it . Don 't be a baby . Captain hasn 't left the suite . Think he pulled it off ? Any word on Michener 's transport ? Still on schedule , according to my source . You and that guard seem to be getting along pretty well . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) - ( CRACKS ) - Ah ! ( GROANS ) Don 't get your hopes up . That was just an anesthetic . DANNY : Niels , can you believe that shit ? How did he hook up with these assholes ? - What the hell do you think they 're up to ? - I 'm not sure . But whatever it is , he 'll be spreading the virus . You think they might recognize us ? Nah , we saw him for what ? All of 20 seconds ? And he was inside a bubble . Well , you 're a lot less recognizable than me if it comes to that . ( SCOFFS ) I 'm just saying . I mean , you got that , um , vanilla thing . - ( LAUGHS ) - Look at me . Okay , whatever you say , Duck Dynasty . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah , I 'm a distinctive man . ( BEEPS ) Bloody hell . We 've got a bearing on that American ship . It 's in firing range and getting closer . - They pinged us . - No , not yet . - We ought to take the shot . - When we can 't move ? We can move . IAN : Without our sound matting , we 'll be as bright as a friggin ' firecracker to them . I say we take the first shot , right now . I like our chances . - That 's what Sean would want , anyway . - That 's what Ned would want . Course , he don 't mind the idea of going to hell . - I 've got another mind about that . - They 're headed straight for our compound . - I don 't think that 's an accident . - Then take the bloody shot , then ! Take it ! SLATTERY : Still 20 miles from the mouth of the river . Let 's hope we make it by the time the boys call for the extraction . And what if that sub 's parked off the coast waiting for us ? We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . I was thinking we should move Dr. Scott somewhere safe , somewhere off the ship . She won 't be any safer on land . You know what they did to Dr. Hunter and all the labs . They got people on the ground , Master Chief . Sounds like a whole lot of them . All over the place . We 're just one ship . ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) " lt is our responsibility as Immunes to restore this great nation . " " And just as God chose Noah to survive the flood of the Old Testament , " he has chosen us to survive this plague " that washed away the sins of our world . " Yes . - Do I sound convincing ? - Do you believe it ? Why , yes . Of course , but I don 't have Sean 's charisma . I watched his videos . I 've seen the translations into Spanish , Bulgarian . You don 't understand the language , but you believe what he 's saying . Bulgaria ? He has followers everywhere . I used to do Meet the Press every once in a while , but getting in front of crowds like this ... ( SIGHS ) MAN : All right , now throw these two on the top . - All right , two more cards . - Sir ... I hope I 'm not out of line , but you look tired . Some fresh air might be good for you . ( EXHALES ) I 'm sure we could clear the courtyard of the volunteers so you won 't have to worry about getting mobbed again , right , fellas ? MAN : If that 's what he wants . Right . Excuse me . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) - What 's all these ? - What do you mean ? This is all that I 've made . We 're going to find more survivors , no ? No , no , no . You do one a day . And if that works , then we can talk about doing more . - Well , that 's not what Sean said . - Well , Sean ain 't here . Okay , fine , it 's not what Sean said , but all right . So remember , the gel , it soaks the fur , so as long as the bear is wet , it 's contagious . So really encourage the child to squeeze the bear . ( LAUGHS ) What the hell ? I 'm not doing your dirty work for you . Then I can 't do it . I mean , if I breathe on them , they 'll get the virus anyway . It 's not a controlled experiment . We need to see if the bear works . ( SIGHS ) I need a volunteer . Who likes kids ? Yeah , I 'll go . I 'll do it . - Give it to him . - What can I do for you , sir ? See that trailer park over there ? Go and , uh , go and hand it out to one of the kids . - It , uh , squeaks . - ( BEAR SQUEAKS ) Kids enjoy that . Yeah , it 's our way of making friends in the community . You know , they may not be immune , but we got to be good neighbors . And , you know , people are a bit skittish of strangers , so this will loosen them up . Yeah , sure . Jimmy , take Willie and go and back him up . I don 't understand . The machine didn 't work ? No , the machine is not the problem . The mice closest to the porthole were able to inhale the vaccine immediately . So , by the time the powder made its way to the second chamber , it must 've lost its potency . Imagine dropping it from 300 feet . We 'll be lucky if anyone catches the therapeutic dose . It 'll be completely inactive by the time it reaches the ground . ( SQUEAKING ) So , what do we do ? I don 't know yet . Let 's go , everybody ! Over here . Over here . ( MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) Sir ? We 're all set . Well , it doesn 't look like anyone 's here . I guess we should head back . That 's Sean 's little brother . We do what he says . Keep looking . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( SIGHS ) Help you with something ? I feel like we 've met . ( CHUCKLES ) Not unless you 've been to Reno . ( MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ) No , I don 't know where is this Reno , but ... We 've met before . - You 're creeping me out , man . - Ah . This is Cobra . I 've got eyes on CO . He 's with three other men . Not sure who they are . But they 're on the move . How soon until you can launch the helo ? Still six miles out , sir . MAN : I don 't see anyone . You ? What are you waiting for ? Maybe you guys should stay back . We don 't wanna scare her . - All right . - Okay . The Vyerni . Yeah , that 's it . You know , I think Ned and his brother would be very interested to find out who you really are , huh ? Does he know who you are ? I bet his people won 't be very happy to find out that their whole belief system 's just a sham , that they ain 't chosen , and you 're just the lab rat that started all this . - They need me . - Yeah ? Yeah . More than they need to believe their own story ? Hi there . My name is Danny . What 's your name ? Laura . - Hi , Laura . - What 's that ? No , no , don 't come any closer . I need you to turn around and run away as fast as you can . - Why ? - Doesn 't matter . Just go . Go ! Hey ! Okay , hold , hold ! The virus is all over this thing ! That scientist is trying to poison innocent people - to weed out immunes . - We got our orders , friend . Look , you see this ? You see this ? You see this ? What do you think this is ? What do you think that is ? - What is that ? - Believe me . These people are not who they pretend to be . Now put down your guns , save yourselves , and get outta here ! Sorry , we can 't do that , man . I suggest you stop talking . You 're making a mistake . ( GRUNTING ) MAN : What was that ? - He 's not one of us ! - Hold up . Hold up . He 's from the ship ! He 's from the Nathan James ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! No ! No , no , no ! No . ( NIELS GRUNTING ) - Get in ! - ( GUNS FIRING ) ( MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) - Help .

( BEEPING ) Starting our ascent to radio depth . Verify sonar with fire control . - If you see anything , we dive immediately . - Aye . Sir ? We 're picking up something on sonar . Three nautical miles away , close to the surface . - This one 's moving . - That has to be our sub . Set quiet two and EMCON . Alert Tiger and Cobra . Bridge , it 's the XO . Reduce speed to 4 knots . Can 't risk a fight now . We 've gotta get our people out of there . - I 've got a bearing of 170 . - Make ready ASROCs and stand by . - Sir ? - lf they fire , we fire back . This is Tiger team standing by rally point .

Some of our guys were picked off at the drop site . We have orders to evacuate the President . Get him back to the sub . Now ! Wait ! We go out that way , he 'll be mobbed . We need to take him out back . ( ORDERING IN ITALIAN ) MAN : Secure the compound ! Lock it up ! Go , go , go ! MAN 2 : Go , go ! You heard him ! Let 's go ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) Hey !

Come on . - We need our helo in the air . - Sir , we cannot launch the helo until we are into the mouth of the harbor . - How much further ? - Half a mile , sir . At reduced speed , we 're still seven minutes away . SEAN : Seal the exits ! There are people from that bloody ship inside here ! No one leaves this compound , you hear me ?

These people believe what he 's selling . You can 't do this to me ! You can 't . You have no right to do this to me . No right ! You hear me ? Well , our Commander-ln-Chief doesn 't seem too happy to be with us , does he ? Well , that 's something we 're gonna have to change . Won 't be easy , if he really is one of them .

But it wasn 't always the power choice for 99 % of the world 's governing economic bodies . Auxilisun was born from innovation required after the three-plant meltdown turned the world away from nuclear energy . Oil barons and green extremists drove energy costs higher and higher , resulting in the energy crisis of 2018 . The world descended into chaos until Auxilisun introduced the tri-fission engine . An Auxilisun containment facility was constructed over the three-plant disaster site so the tri-fission engine could clean up the dangerous radiation . Progress was slow . But independent scientific studies prove that Auxilisun 's miraculous tri-fission engine not only worked , but it also created new energy from the radiation it was cleaning , and thus began the energy revolution of 2025 . No more dirty biofuels , inconsistent wind or expensive solar . Tri-fission engines clean up old waste while Auxilisun continues to build its next-generation plants across the world . Today nuclear energy powers everything you do , and Auxilisun is there to make sure it stays safe , sustainable and , most importantly , affordable . Auxilisun- - creating a new future by cleaning up the past . [ clunking ] [ whirring ] - [ beeping ] - [ gasps ] [ beeping continues ] Lights on . [ beeping continues ] [ sighs ] Alarm off . [ beeping stops ] [ line ringing ] CSE Dixon , it 's the middle of the night . David , communications are down with both of the field techs- - It 's Christmas Day . Is this something that can wait until tomorrow ? Gibson Desert North is the largest nuclear waste repository in the southern hemisphere . It doesn 't take the day off . Something 's wrong . We don 't have anyone available . I 'll go . What ? You don 't have anyone available . I 'm going out there myself . Call the transpo . I 'll be ready in ten . Coming in on the red zone now . Completely uninhabitable . You do not wanna lose your fuel out here . So Auxilisun 's sending a tech assistant to a facility this remote . No chief engineers available ? I am a chief tech engineer . [ chuckles ] How many facilities you engineered ? None . I was recently promoted . My work 's been lab-based . Live view up . Now , that 's what a real-life Auxilisun containment facility looks like . You don 't see that in a lab . This your first flight schedule too ? There 's nothing in here about a pickup . We 've lost communication to Gibson Desert North . Once I get them back up , I 'll contact Auxilisun HQ for a pickup and request that they don 't send you . [ beeping ] [ female electronic voice ] System activated . [ rapid clicking ] [ clicking ] [ clicking ] Decontaminate . Begin decontamination . [ Klaxon blaring ] [ clicking ] Abby Dixon reporting . I.D. HEB0511 . Entry 001 . Upon my entry into the facility , no employee response . The facility itself is in a state of disrepair , possibly deserted . I will log my entries and upload them as soon as I get the comms back online . [ clinking ] Hello ! - [ Abby gasps ] - Who are you ? I 'm a technical facility engineer from Auxilisun . Mm-hmm . What are you doing here ? Your communications are down . I 'm here to get you back online . Some ID ? Can I see some ID ? I can 't connect to openwork . Openwork 's not worth shit down here . Do you have a scanner ? There 's a scanner . There . On the table . Yeah . [ sighs ] [ scanner beeps ] Mm-hmm . Happy ? Mm-hmm . My name 's Dixon . Abby Dixon . How 'd you get here ? I was just dropped off by a company tri-copter . Just you ? Yeah . Just you . Just me . Mm-hmm . I 'll be here long enough to get you back online . Which one are you ? Zek or Robinson . Robinson . I 'm Robinson . Yeah . You almost gave me a heart attack . Making noises in the corridor . - They don 't teach you how to knock at Auxilisun HQ ? - Where 's Dr. Zek ? He 's out . What do you mean " out " ? Where ? Does surveys . In the desert . I don 't know . It 's not my job . Well , when will he be back ? He didn 't say . Took the buggy . [ sighs ] - [ Klaxon blaring ] - What is that ? It 's nothing . I got it under control . What do you mean it 's nothing ? It 's- - It 's obviously something . It 's not . [ blaring continues ] What are you talking about ? Right here it says , " Error code 8627B . " What does that mean ? What 's the procedure ? Mm-hmm . [ blaring continues ] The procedure is you need to chill out . Okay , this is not a joke . This is a sophisticated facility , and I 'm here to assess the communication breakdown , and this could potentially be a communication- - [ blaring stops ] I pulled that lever . Did you see me pull that lever ? It resets the system . Yeah . It makes all these red lights go green . I told you I had it under control . Hmm ? [ chuckles ] Will you at least show me to my room ? Mm . I wasn 't ... expecting guests . I 'm sure you 'll love your accommodations . [ Robinson grunting ] All right . General ... common area . Um , kitchen , obviously . And up those stairs is the sunroom . Doesn 't look like it gets much use . No . Um , not really the tanning type . Right . But that 's not the point . The sunrooms were designed- - To provide a certain amount of UV to keep your mind in the right- - My mental health is fine , thank you . Is this sick bay ? Yeah . Your own doctor as well . It 's kind of fun . So ... this- - Yeah , that 's you . Guest quarters . It 's not much , but you know- - Maid comes at 10 : 00 a.m. for a fluff and fold . Merry Christmas . [ sighs ] [ whirring , clanging ] Robinson ? [ bat squeaking , wings flapping ] Robinson ? [ guitar strumming ] Robinson . [ strumming ] Oh . Hello . Wow . I didn 't realize this was gonna be a formal occasion . I would 've shaved my face . What 's that ? In case I need to reach you in the facility . Aw , you don 't need that . You 're never too far away . So this is what you came here to see , huh ? [ beeping , whirring ] [ beeping ] [ beeping , whirring ] [ beeping ] [ beeping , whirring ] - What 's wrong with it ? - [ beeping ] Ah , I very much enjoyed our conversation . I was feeling a little lonely before you turned up . You are just a breath of fresh air . I 'm not here to talk . I 'm here to fix your facility . Yes . What 's that ? Universal comm unit . The nerve center for our whole communication array . How do you not know this ? The thing 's a dinosaur . Like everything else around here . Gibson Desert North is not a dinosaur . It 's the prototype that our entire company is hinged on . And our proudest achievement . Oh . Well , then that 's just a little bit sad . [ whirring ] [ strumming continues ] So ? [ low humming ] Sorry . Can you fix it ? There 's no power . I have batteries . I 'm gonna have to run a diagnostics scan on the entire facility to see where the breakdown in the system is . Diagnostics scan , huh ? Yeah . Yeesh . Would you mind showing me to the machine room ? Sure . [ strumming stops ] Now . Don 't touch the guitar , please . [ sighs ] What facility do you work at ? I don 't work at any one particular facility . I 'm based at HQ . Oh . So you don 't know anything about SDP then . Sensory deprivation psychosis . I came up with that . What is it ? Well , you know , you spend too much on your own in a place like this- - no windows- - you go a little- - You go a little psycho , you know . I mean- - That 's why we give psychological profiles to all of our employees before they get the job . Yeah . Well , it 's not that simple . When did you say Dr. Zek is gonna be back ? I didn 't . Well , you have to know something about his schedule . No . I mean , you know , he works in a completely different part of the compound behind a locked door . He 's the one with the Ph.D. , remember . I stay out of his way , take out the trash . And he just goes out every now and again ? Look , I 'm not the boss . He is . I 'm not his mum . That 's not what I 'm suggesting . I 'm just- - We 're almost here . It 's through here to his lab ? Yeah , yeah . It 's down the end of this corridor . Get a chance to , uh , see Dr. Zek 's crazy scientific experiments up close . I 've read his reports . There 's nothing in Dr. Zek 's work that is outside of company parameters . Oh , yeah ? Why does he do it all behind a locked door ? Never lets me in . You 're obviously creating some kind of fantasy . Is this the isolation psychosis you 're talking about ? No . Well , maybe . Take a look at his lab . It 'll bore you to death . [ lock opens ] Just don 't touch anything . Oh . Wow ! That ... is something . [ whirring ] Is this where they keep all the shit ? The shit ? Nuclear shit . No . The waste is kept in Deep Burial , behind those doors . You think this place is impressive ? Deep Burial is ten times the size . What 's this then ? The cooling system . Maglev fan built to last 200,000 years . But that 's nothing compared to this . This is the real secret to Auxilisun 's success . The tri-fission engine . It takes the energy from the radioactive decay in Deep Burial and powers the fans . I should have access . This fan breaks down , guess who has to fix it . That 's impossible . If both fans stopped , then this place would fill up with gas so fast , it would be like a stick of nuclear dynamite . And never in the history of Auxilisun has even one fan broken down . It 's a brilliant design . How come the only access through it is through this doggy door ? Robotics are the only thing that can fix a tri-fission engine . Even in a hazmat suit , there 's so much radiation , you 'd be dead in 48 hours . You should know that . Where 's the other fan ? Down in Deep Burial . We 're in the part of the facility that needs " golden ticket " access to enter . Just looking . Okay . You need level-14 access to get down into Deep Burial sites . Oh . What are you , level 18 or something ? When they zap us with the scanners , we just get the basic package . You know . Office , bedroom . Shitters . Did you fix the comms ? No . All the fuses and the cabling are all intact , so the problem must be somewhere between here and there . Hmm . You 're gonna show me Deep Burial ? No . No one goes down into Deep Burial . Dr. Zek . He goes into Deep Burial . You 're mistaken . I hear him down there all the time . Every time he opens that door , it rumbles the whole facility . You 're wrong . [ chuckles ] You think I 'm making this up ? No . I think you 're confused . Dr. Zek doesn 't even have fingertip access to Deep Burial . You sure about that ? [ coughing ] [ coughing continues ] [ body thuds ] Robinson ? [ clanging ] Jesus ! Robinson ! Robinson ! What ? Wha- - What ? Are you okay ? You 're hitting me . I 'm sorry . I just fell . What happened ? [ groans ] Just a long day , you know ? I need some sleep maybe . Do you generally pass out when you 're tired ? Well , I didn 't really pass out . I just had a moment of- - What are you doing ? I 'm fine . When was the last time you requested a medical exam ? I don 't need a medical exam . [ footsteps departing ] Abby Dixon . Entry 002 . I arrived this morning to find Dr. Darius Zek , the chief scientific executive , absent , surveying the surrounding area . But that is unconfirmed . The facility 's caretaker , Robinson Scott , was uncooperative . The comms are still down , but my preliminary tests as to why were inconclusive . I 've never seen an Auxilisun facility like this . It 's ... neglected . And Robinson Scott- - I don 't know who hired him , but ... [ sighs ] [ gasps ] [ breathes heavily ] [ screams ] Sor- - Sorry . [ singing ] - Oi . - Hmm . Dodgy lock in there . Sorry about that . Can you fix it ? Well , there 's no point , is there , really . Not gonna make the same mistake twice . I 'm just not used to having guests . You carry that thing everywhere , huh ? I heard you talking on it last night . The walls are quite thin . Well , I gather information , report back to Auxilisun . It 's my job . It 's protocol . Is Dr. Zek back ? No . Is it normal for him to be gone overnight like that ? Sure . Macchiato . Oh . No , not for me . That is the world 's greatest macchiato . You got to try it . It 's hot . Sugar ? Uh , no . I 'm okay . Leave her there . Make me one . I wanna do a medical diagnostic test on you . Medical- - Last night- - No , that thing last night was fine . Uh , no . You can have serious health problems . Here . That 's very sweet , but I am fine . Now I 'm fine . When I was younger , I had a thing . My kidneys . Gone now . I 'm fine . Was it from drinking ? It was cassies mainly . Some drinking . I have a sister , Margot . She was- - She 's ... your age . She sobered me up . Took care of me . Got me better . Got me off it . Everyone else left me behind . She saw me right . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . It 's gone . Don 't drink the water . It 's not good . It 's excellent . You 're crazy . Do you not want yours ? It 's all yours . Two cups of coffee for me . Watch out . Cheers . I was cleaning out this old guy 's place , right ? This was something that we used to do when they got kicked out of their places . And it was something that I could kind of do when I was a little high and stuff , you know . Easy kind of job to do . So cleaning out this guy 's place , throwing away his clothes and furniture and things he 's not gonna need . And then I see at one point he 's got a bunch of CD 's . So I 'm thinking , " Oh , that 's cool . " Bunch of what ? He has a bunch of CD 's . Um , compound discs . Uh , compact discs . You know , the little music . Little silver disc things . Oh . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Like old turn-of-the-century music . And he 's got some stuff that I kind of recognize . Like Oasis . Remember ? Shed Seven . Um- - [ clears throat ] East 17 . So I 'm thinking while I 'm cleaning this house out , I 'm gonna play some music . I 'm looking through his music . " I 'm gonna pick that . I 'm gonna pick that . " And this bag falls out . So I 'm thinking , " Oh , well , you know , he 's kind of hiding that bag . " In this little zip bag . So what 's inside here ? I don 't really know that much about turn-of-the-century music . Do know a little bit about retro kind of drugs and stuff . So I look inside and there 's this- - this crystal , this rock , you know . Like , " Hello ! Yes . Know what that is . Crack cocaine . " So run around the house . Run around the house . Like , make sure I 'm kind of safe doing it . Like , I need , like , a lighter and a little bit of aluminum foil and a little glass pipe type thing . Get that all going . You know , I 'll do it . Put it all in and break off a little bit of crack . Put it in the pipe thing and then- - [ imitating flame ] Kind of fire it up . Wait . Nothing . Now , you 're talking about maybe , like , two , three minutes or so . You should be off . You should be , like , away , doing it . Nothing . So I think , " Well , maybe it 's like weak crack or something . " So break off a little more , put it in the thing . Get the lighter- - [ imitating flame ] Kind of fire it up . Nothing . I end up smoking the whole piece of crack . That 's a lot of crack . That is a lot of crack . Nothing . Like , 20 , 25 minutes in , man , I get pounded by this , like , headache . Just like my head gets filled with cement or something like that . Kind of feel a little sick . The next thing I know , I pass out on someone else 's , like , floor . It 's not even my house . I 'm out , like this . And the next thing I know , the owner of the house , this old geezer , the guy whose house we 're clearing out , like , wakes me up . So I get roused and , you know , I look around . I 'm trying to save face a little bit , but he sees- - He totally sees what I 'm doing . He can see all the stuff . You know what he says ? " My grandma brought that back in 1991 . You just smoked a piece of the Berlin Wall . " [ laughing ] [ babbling ] Oh , man . Is that- - Like smoking history or something . Went to hospital- - I was in hospital for two days , on my own . And then , you know , ended up my sister came . Kind of gave me a little bit of a talking to . " Clean up your life . You need to make some changes " kind of thing . It 's actually what brought me here . She kind of- - She and I agreed to come out here , you know . [ beeping ] What about you ? Me ? Yeah , you know , family . People you talk to , friends . No . No . No family . No family ? You an orphan , raised by Auxilisun ? No . I mean , uh , I have a dad . But- - Technically . I don 't talk to him . What is this ? I was just trying to make a friend . Okay , so ... holidays roll around , you know , your birthday . What do you- - Do you go for lunch on your own ? Play solitaire ? Just nap all day ? I have friends . You do ? Yeah . I 'm skeptical . Name them . Name your friends . Tesla and Jobs . What type of names are those ? That 's- - Come on . They 're my dogs . They- - They 're your dogs ' names ? [ laughs ] Come on . What do you have ? Like little " wee wee wee wee " - - little yappy tiny little things that fits in a little- - like a little bag of sugar ? This is not adding up . The becquerel levels are higher than they should be . I think your calibrations are off . Hmm . Well , maybe someone 's been in Deep Burial . Hmm . What ? No single person , no one , not even someone like Dr. Zek , could create a spike like this . I mean , it 's got to be your gear . It 's not calibrated . I 'll leave you to it . You 'll work it out . Dr. Zek is still missing . I 'm worried about his safety . And there 's ... a problem . According to this data , the red zone is expanding , which I know is not possible . It must be just a misreading with the gear . Robinson is not as skilled as I would expect . [ sighs ] I will recalibrate the meters myself . [ torch hissing ] [ whirring ] [ Abby gasps ] [ Robinson ] What are you looking at ? [ gasps ] Jesus ! Oh . Sorry . I was gonna go on the roof , hit some balls . I thought I saw a man in the desert . Okay . May I ? Sure . Hmm . I don 't see anything . What if it 's Zek ? What if- - What if he 's out there and he 's hurt and he needs our help ? I don 't think Zek 's coming back . He 's been gone four days . No . You said he left yesterday . I didn 't say that . What are you not telling me ? He kind of lost it . Sensory deprivation psychosis . Big time . I don 't know if it was the isolation or the tests he was running . Maybe he was exposed to radiation in Deep Burial . But , you know , he 's went a little- - And then the last night before- - You know , I 'm gonna go hit some balls on the roof . No . No , listen . The power lines were intentionally severed . He cut them ? Tell me what happened . You know , most of the time , just ignore him . I stay in the control room . He does what he wants . Fine . And then before he left , he just- - Screaming . Just screaming down that corridor . It was getting louder and louder , at me . " You did it . You did it . You broke- - You damaged it . You broke the fan . You broke the fan . " He 's pointing at me and accusing me and shouting . He 's a scary guy . And I ran . I ran and I hid . And I heard the doors go , up top . He took the buggy . I don 't- - I mean- - I don 't know how he 'd survive out there . I mean , I 'm telling you , I saw something . Yeah , well , you know , that- - that could be ... this place . It 's the walls . Ground . The air ... gets in you . Hmm . How have you been sleeping ? You 've been dreaming ? Have you been dreaming ? Hmm . Hmm . You can spend as much time as you want in that sunroom . But it gets inside your mind . I 'm gonna go play golf . [ sighs ] [ clunking ] [ beeping ] [ pinging ] [ gasps ] Robinson ? [ door opening ] [ Klaxon blaring ] [ breathing heavily ] [ gasping ] [ breathes heavily ] [ grunts ] - [ beeping ] - Robinson . Robinson , it-it 's Zek . Can you hear- - Can you hear me ? Open the door ! [ Robinson on comm ] I 'm not sure I should override the system . We 're both gonna die if you don 't open this door right now ! [ breathing heavily ] [ banging ] [ door opening ] [ Robinson ] We don 't know his state of radiation exposure . We don 't have time to discuss this . Help me move him . [ golf club clattering ] Go inside . I got him . I think this is a mistake , Abby . Go inside . Go ! Go ! [ grunting ] What the hell was that ? I 'm just following contamination policy . It 's Dr. Zek . You don 't know it 's Dr. Zek . You don 't . Who else could it be ? We 're in the red zone , 300 kilometers from the nearest town . Well ? Yeah , it 's Dr. Zek . How is he ? His pulse is even . Is it ? He was pretty exposed out there . What 's that ? Hexomorphone . [ air cartridge hisses ] [ gasps ] It should help combat the symptoms of radiation poisoning . Hmm . Didn 't get very far , did he ? I don 't know . Maybe he came back . [ sighs ] What happened to you ? [ door opens , closes ] What is that ? Precaution . He 's dangerous , isn 't he ? He 's in a coma . Well , you wake up from a coma . Okay . You need some help ? Why don 't you just go back to the control room . It 's good , you know . He 's back . That 's the important thing . [ door opens , closes ] [ sighs ] [ birds tweeting ] [ clicking , hissing ] [ clicking , hissing continue ] [ cries out , gasps ] [ sighs ] [ gasps ] Wha- - You were screaming . I was concerned . It was just a nightmare . About your dad ? You said his name . It 's this place . I 'm fine . Could 've fooled me . My dad euthanized my grandmother when I was seven . [ Klaxon blaring ] [ blaring continues ] [ Robinson coughs ] Fan 's not working . Look , look ! N-No , that 's impossible . Just reset the console . All of your readings have been off . [ Abby ] I 'm sure that 's it . [ blaring stops ] [ machinery whirring ] Whew . Okay . That helped , but look . It 's still- - It 's not movin ' . Okay . [ beeping ] I 'm gonna check it out . You just ... stay here . Okay . [ door opens ] [ machinery rumbling ] [ Robinson ] What happened ? Did you go back in there ? Huh ? What ? [ Abby ] The fan . I can 't . I don 't have access . Remember ? What are you accusing me of ? I 'm sorry . It- - It 's not possible unless somebody sabotaged the engine room . It just- - It can 't- - It can 't happen . [ sighs ] I need to get the comms back up . Get back in touch with HQ . This is beyond me now . Okay , how serious is it ? Do we need to evacuate ? No . As long as the other fan is up , it 'll take days before the gases build up to a dangerous level . Zek . We are experiencing unprecedented shutdown of the machine and fan . Requesting immediate emergency facility repair team . Reason for the shutdown is unknown . A fan is down . How does that make sense ? With Auxilisun systems , a fan cannot go down unless ... someone sabotaged it . Signing off . [ strumming ] I don 't like him being here . He 's handcuffed . You don 't know him like I do . [ plucking guitar string ] Look , why don 't you let me watch him for a while . No , I got it . You 've got a job to do . It 's under control . You can 't just stand here all night watching him . I got this . He wakes up ... he moves ... call me . [ plays guitar ] [ sighing ] [ heart monitor beeping ] [ clicking , hissing ] - Wha-- - It 's- - It 's okay . - What ? - It 's okay . What is this- - What is this place ? Where am I ? You 're at Auxilisun Gibson Desert North . Gibson Desert North ? Robinson . He 's awake . Robinson . Robinson ? Oh . [ chuckles ] Okay . Okay ? Thank God . Wha- - What ? Why am I- - I 'm Abby Dixon . I 'm the facilities engineer from Auxilisun . I was flown in . What happened to me ? Just relax , and , uh , we 'll get you up to speed . - [ Zek ] Uh ... - Dr . Sale told me to say hello . Dr. Jeffrey Sale ? Three years in his class , and then I was his intern . He got me my first job interview at Auxilisun . [ chuckles ] He told me to tell you hi . Oh . We haven 't talked since I came here . Jeffrey and I got our master 's together . I was in his wedding party . Yeah . He 's got some very nice things to say about you . He made ' em up then . [ laughs ] Well , he says that you are the most brilliant nuclear containment scientist that he 's ever had the pleasure to meet . [ Abby ] Here . [ panting ] Hello . Thank you , Robinson . You 're welcome . How do you feel ? [ handcuffs rattle ] What 's this for ? Do you not remember what happened with the night that you left ? I can 't recall . - You went a little crazy . - You had a nervous breakdown . [ Robinson ] So that is , unfortunately , the reason why you 're in handcuffs . For our safety , but primarily for your safety . Thank you . You 're welcome . I 'm not feeling well . I 'm gonna lie down . [ Robinson ] Yeah , right . Relax . Do you have a , um , personal hygiene kit ? I just think ... it 'd make Dr. Zek feel a lot better to not have a week 's worth of desert filth all over him . - You want me to go get it ? - I 'll be fine . Two minutes . [ door opens , closes ] Dr. Zek ? Is there something you 're not telling me ? Come here . I have to know that I can trust you . Well , of course you can trust me . Dr. Jeffrey Sale 's son , tell me about him . He 's in his ... 20s . He just got married . I haven 't actually met him in person , but ... Tell me the truth about Jeffrey Sale 's son , now . He 's not Dr. Sale 's real son . [ sighs ] His wife was pregnant when he met her , but I 'm not supposed to tell anyone that . Nobody knows that . I know . I know . Except people worth trusting . [ sighing ] Okay . That man ... isn 't Robinson Scott . What ? Dr. Zek , you acted like you knew him . Well , I had to . I 'm handcuffed here . The only reason he 's not killing me is because you think that he 's Robinson Scott . Okay , look . The other night , I was in my lab , alone . I was working . And then suddenly , there was a breach . And Robinson- - the real Robinson Scott- - he went out to check it out , and he was obviously overpowered by this guy . And then this man , he found me . I left Robinson . So if this isn 't ... Robinson Scott , then how did this person get here ? We 're in the middle of the red zone . I have no idea . He must have been dropped in . I 'm not sure . I don 't know . Do you know anything about what he wants ? We need to get out of here . We don 't have much time . So when 's your next scheduled pickup ? I told them that I 'd contact them . Shit . Are the comms still down ? Yes , but the antenna on your buggy . I can hot-wire it , use the universal comm hub to get a signal . Good . Then you send out a Code 7 distress call , but you can 't let him know that you sent it . As long as he believes that you don 't know the truth , we 'll be okay . We will . And why wouldn 't he just kill us ? And he hasn 't tried to kill you yet ? He needs you for something . I 'm setting up my two-way tuned into my frequency . So while I 'm gone , if he comes back , I 'll hear everything that happens . Good . Thanks . Abby . Yeah . We can do this . [ child giggling ] [ beep ] [ Zek on comm ] Abby , he 's here . He 's coming . Okay . Here we go . Where ? [ chuckles ] Where ? [ beeping ] We have a problem . Robinson is not Robinson . Somebody broke into the facility . That 's why Dr. Zek attempted to escape . We need help immediately . So lie back . Just lay your head back . There . Must feel nice . Get that desert grime off you . If you just put your hand down . Gotta keep you handcuffed for your own safety , Dr. Zek . I know . These razors are incredibly sharp . Try and think that you 're in one of those old movies ... in a barbershop . Where 's Abby ? She went to my office , to my lab , to get my tablet . Just gonna- - Yeah , that looks like it 's gonna work just fine . Ah , yeah . Okay . I 'm actually gonna have to just lean you back a little further . Just can 't quite reach those- - Oh , no . difficult areas . You-You don 't have to do my neck . [ Robinson over comm ] Relax . [ Robinson ] Just relax . - Robinson ? - Just finishing up here . [ Robinson ] Much better . Done . You do look much better . Here . You forgot my tablet . Your lab was such a mess , I couldn 't find it . You 'll have to give me better directions . Oh . Yeah , of course . [ Abby ] Dr. Zek , you 've had quite a day . I know . Think you could maybe use a little rest ? Hmm ? No , no , no . I 'll give you this to relax . I don 't- - [ exhales ] - Put him down , Robinson . - Okay . Just keep an eye on him . He was extremely nervous . Well done for knocking him out like that . I just thought we would both sleep a little easier knowing that he was drugged asleep . Yeah . He doesn 't seem to remember anything . You believe him ? Does he seem dangerous to you ? Well ... things aren 't always what they seem . Hmm ? [ door opens , closes ] [ snores , groans ] Shh . What 's happening ? I had to inject you to wake you up . Where 's the guy ? He 's sleeping . We gotta get out of here . Look away . Did you send the signal ? Not yet . That 's where we 're headed . [ Abby ] We have to get out of here . It 's gonna take 40 minutes for them to get here . - We 'll wait outside . Okay . - Okay , let 's go . Too late . [ Abby gasps ] What are you doing , Abby ? [ Abby ] You 're not Robinson Scott . What are you talking about ? - Dr . Zek- - - Stay still ! Dr. Zek told me- - [ Zek ] Abby . Abby . The doctor , eh ? You trust the good doctor ? Is that how it works ? You tell the truth . You tell her the truth right now ! What 's he talking about ? The ravings of a madman . You tell her about Gibson Desert North . About Auxilisun 's crown jewel , now ! What ? Tell her . I have no idea what you 're talking about . And you 're willing to bet our lives on that , are you ? - Um , yeah . - [ Abby grunts ] [ Abby shrieks ] Ow ! Aaah ! [ Robinson grunts ] Aaah ! [ Robinson groaning ] Let me see . Am I bleeding ? Looks like the laser cauterized the wound . Come here . Aaah ! [ grunts ] To the bed . Here . What did he say about me ? [ grunts ] Don 't touch it . He told me you were some kind of terrorist that broke in here and killed the real Robinson . You believed him ? Dr. Zek is a respected member of the scientific community . What was I supposed to think ? Dr. Zek is a lunatic . How am I gonna get across the red zone ? How am I gonna get across the size of that desert ? I 'd have radiation poisoning by the time I got here . He destroyed the door mechanism . [ door warbles ] We 're locked in here . He 's gonna escape without us . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . He 's not escaping . He 's going to Deep Burial . [ Robinson grunts , gasps ] Bastard . Just ... Hmm . What did you mean ? When you said that- - that this whole place was a lie . It hurts . What did you mean ? This place is supposed to be a secure nuclear storage facility . He 's turned it into a bomb . Thanks . Abby , I don 't- - I don 't know what we do now . How do we get to him ? He 's in Deep Burial . I have access . You do ? Yeah . That 's great . Hang on . Okay . I 'm gonna rewire the door so the mechanism works from this side . [ grunts ] [ instrument clattering ] [ Robinson ] You can do that ? [ beeps ] [ grunts ] [ Robinson ] Nice . [ Robinson grunts ] Watch out . We need to find him . I can trace his location on my tablet . No time for that ! [ Robinson ] No time ! [ tablet beeping ] [ gasping ] Fuck . [ beeping , whirring ] - [ Robinson grunts ] - [ Zek shouting ] [ grunting ] [ gun powers up ] Drop the club . Okay , okay . Who are you ? Okay , okay . [ Robinson , Abby groaning ] [ coughs , retches ] You 're the one with radiation sickness . - You walked across the red zone ? - Shut up ! - Who are you ? Please . - Shut up . Who are you ? Shut up ! Nothing can stop me from doing what I came here to do ! Aaah ! [ groans ] [ Klaxon blaring ] [ Abby ] Aaah ! [ gun powers up ] What are you doing ? Gibson Desert North has been decaying at an unpredictable rate for years , and you knew it ! You know that Auxilisun system 's fail-safe . There 's no way- - What about Barrow Creek ? All of the closest inhabitable cities are supposed to be well within the green zone . So unless Barrow Creek- - the entire town- - got up and moved , the red zone is expanding . Yes . When were you gonna tell Auxilisun ? Auxilisun already knows . What ? Dr. Sale and I know the truth . The truth ? Yeah . The truth that you 're killing people ? The truth is that the energy we give the world is more important than some piece-of-shit small town- - But no , people di- - in the middle of nowhere ! His- - That man 's family . How many have lived ? Do you know how many hospitals , cities , homes use our energy ? There were 230 assholes in Barrow Creek ! Shut up ! [ gun powers up ] Aaah ! Shut up , okay ? [ gun powers down ] You can find your own way out . [ Klaxon blaring in distance ] [ Zek ] Abby . [ child giggling on video ] [ coughs ] So you were the one that was ruining the fans . You walked across the red zone by yourself ? How long have you been dying ? Not sure . We all got sick at the same time . I just lasted longer than Margot ... and Sammy . This won 't bring them back . I know what it 's like to lose your family . [ rumbling ] Then you know why I have to do this . No . You 're just gonna kill more people . I can 't let you- - Don 't follow me , Abby . Stop . Stay back ! Stop ! No ! Stay back , Abby ! Stop . Auxilisun , they took everything from me . If you destroy this place , you 're no better than they are . And you are ? [ gasping ] [ Abby ] No . [ Robinson ] The world needs a tragedy - to see what 's been happening here . - [ gun powers up ] I 'll kill you before I let that happen . No , you won 't . [ breathing heavily ] If we can get out of here , I have all the information on my ADATA . You and I , we can blow the whistle . We can let everybody know . No , Abby . They 'll shut you down , Abby ! This thing 's bigger than you ! The whole world , Abby ! They 're being lied to ! Is this what Margot and Sammy would have wanted ? Not sure . I don 't know . Maybe I 'll get a chance to ask ' em . No ! [ electricity crackling ] [ Klaxon blaring ] [ rumbling ] This is CTE Abby Dixon to Auxilisun tri-copter . Rhine , do you read me ?

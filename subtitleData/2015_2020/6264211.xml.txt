 Previously , on Defiance ... Why would Amanda Rosewater honor my husband ? Your husband Datak died a hero . He walked into Rahm Tak 's camp with a device implanted in his forearm . Oh , shit . You 're going to help me hunt . What is that ? A control stem . It keeps you shapetakers docile . Enough ! You are forbidden to feed . Why ? Indogene were created for that very purpose . Good-bye , Kindzi . You will sleep with your family until you learn your place . I made a mistake . No ! No ! People died . Take a couple of hours , get your head on straight . You saying I can 't do the job ? He was weak . You need to be strong , soldier . You hear me ? We 're trapped . All right , let 's do this . Butch and Sundance . Nolan ... _ Please don 't shoot ! It wasn 't his fault . Live or die together ! No ! Come on ! _ ♪ Hey , yeah , oh ♪ The grieving Widow Tarr . Look at her . What does she want with the Omec ? What 's she after ? Good question . The woman 's a traitor . She deserves to die . Yeah , but we did that deal with her husband . Don 't care . Thank you for convincing me to leave my house . It was a kindness . I had business in town . I wanted to see how you were . There was nothing left of my husband to bury . That is how I am . I am sorry . I am not good company right now . It is understandable . Have you seen your son ? A sore subject . Blood lilies . _ _ _ The lady is with me . _ _ To brighten your home during a time of grief . Oh . Surely you didn 't come all this way just to buy me flowers . No , I did not . The Tsuroz is almost refueled . It is time for me to consider what will happen next . You will wake your people . Of course . And then what exactly ? I cannot risk releasing them among the people of Earth , not at first . The rash actions of Kindzi has made that abundantly clear . Where is exactly is Kindzi ? I do not wish to discuss it . Oh . Tell me this at least . Am I in any danger ? Kindzi is in no position to hurt you or anyone else . Irisa , where 's Nolan ? He didn 't come home last night . We have a situation . There is a large island that is called Australia . It is remote and uninhabited . A place where the Omec would be isolated . Earth is a complicated planet . When my children awake , their first steps will be unstable . I cannot allow them to stumble as Kindzi did . They will need time , as all children do . They will need guidance as all children do . Fortunately , they have a noble and wise father . Yet no mother . Come with us . Prove to my people that the Omec can at long last live side-by-side with Votans , as equals . The past need not define the present . You do me great honor ... but my home is here . Here ? Among people that call you traitor ? Your husband , it is dead . You must at long last stop grieving and move forward . But my son and grandchild are here and very much alive . Bring them along . I promise you , we will treat them as equals , as family . Tell me you will consider it . I will . Mmm . Nolan . Where have you been ? Patrolling . You didn 't answer your hailer . What 's with the getup ? The Votanis Collective is here . What ? They radioed from Bissel Pass about 30 minutes ago , requesting permission to enter . And you said yes ? Yeah , with the stasis nets destroyed , it 's not like we had much choice . Keep smiling . Hands off the gun . They say they just want to talk . Mayor Rosewater I take it ? Vice Chancellor Voske . Please , I get enough of the Vice Chancellor bit in Brazil . Call me Silora . Very well , Silora . You can call me Amanda . And this is my lawkeeper . Ah , Joshua Nolan , yes , I know by reputation only . This is Sturuje , my Chief of Staff . Madam Mayor . And I trust our traveling companion requires no introduction . My dear friends , I imagine you 're surprised to see me . _ _ _ _ So , here we all are , me , the Votanis Collective , and Datak Tarr . The big question is why ? I have been authorized to negotiate a strategic alliance with Defiance . Oh , wow . I-I 'm sorry , Silora , I 'm a little bit confused . Your army has been murdering our citizens the last few weeks . Your spies sabotaged us . They brought down the St. Louis Arch . Under duress . You have blood on your hands . My God , you don 't know , do you ? Rahm Tak was rogue . You were never at war with the Collective , but with a madman on a genocidal crusade to cleanse the Earth of her rightful inhabitants . My dear human , we have come to apologize . Apologize ? The Collective would like to help us usher in a new era of friendship . 12 guards total . 2 in the room , 3 on the doors downstairs , leaves 7 at the trucks . So , let us all drink to peace . I 'm sorry , why is he here ? We found him in the ruins of General Rahm Tak 's encampment , grievously injured . We provided medical care and gifted him with a biomechanical arm . He gave us the impression you would be pleased to see him . Well , I had every reason to expect a warm reception , given that I almost died saving this town . Almost . The fact you didn 't makes me wonder what game you 're playing ... what game they 're playing . Nolan , dial it down . My lawkeeper is suspicious by nature . Damn right I 'm suspicious . Datak Tarr comes waltzing in here all fat and sassy with his haint friends , expecting ... Watch your mouth , Butcher . Watch your mouth . Nolan ! Leave , now . Nolan ? I say good riddance . You too , Datak . Grown-ups need to talk . You 're dismissing me ? Like some handmaiden ? Go home and relax . Pleasure your wife . Give some thought as to how you intend to pay me back for that extremely expensive arm you have acquired under false pretenses . Of course , Vice Chancellor . Thank you for your time . _ Right now , I 'm looking for someone upon whom I can vent my rage . Are you volunteering ? Are you ? No , Favi Tarr . Well , I best keep up the search then . _ Rahm Tak was originally sent out on a scouting mission with a dozen other divisions after Belize and New York fell . His orders were to collect data and to provide aid and comfort to survivors . And you expect me to believe that you had no idea what he was capable of ? They said he was above reproach . He was married to Vizier Quando 's niece . I , uh ... I sent her in to talk sense to him . Do you know what that vekihabolo did ? Mm-mmm . He sent us back her head mounted on the front of her motorcycle . We were planning to take him out by force , but you people beat us to the punch . You solved our embarrassing problem , and the V.C. owes you one . Oh , I thought the Datak thing would go over better , honestly , I did . That conniving little haint . Silora . It 's okay when I say it . Anyway , that brings us to the present . Vizier Quando has authorized me to offer you the works ... gulanite trade agreement , mutual defense pact , ambassador exchange , you know , blah , blah , blah . And what do you want in return ? There 's no such thing as a free lunch . There are those among my people who celebrate Rahm Tak and his atrocities . Unfortunately , he 's become somewhat of a folk hero , and fighting that perception is an uphill battle . All right . What do you need ? A big win , something to get everyone back on the same side of the aisle . Like what ? My government is terrified of your Omec friends . We 're hardly friends , and just so you know , there 's only two of them . Doesn 't matter . They have a harvester in orbit . Ask any Votan ... bad things happen when an Omec harvester arrives in orbit . My people are scared , and when my people get scared , they have a history of doing stupid things . Like sabotaging an ark and slaughtering an entire race ? I can 't confirm that , but I won 't ... I won 't insult you by denying it . I want you to broker a sit-down between me and their leader . Give me a chance to convince him we mean his people no harm . T 'evgin hates the V.C. He 'll never agree to this . You want peace with the Votanis Collective ? Help me make peace with the Omec . That 's my price . What are you gonna do ? What do you think ? The Votanis Collective doesn 't hand out fancy Indogene limbs for nothing . You 're right , they don 't . Wonder how Datak earned his . Hey , Datak . Answer time . Looking for a fight ? Nolan , stop . How did you avoid getting blown up ? Don 't do this ! Listen to your child . What did you do ? Make a deal with Rahm Tak ? Is he gonna come waddling down the Hollows next ? Rahm is dead and deservedly so . Yeah ? Why aren 't you ? Ah ! Because a tiger is unable to change his stripes . Oh ! But remains a tiger nonetheless . How about I tear off that robot arm and beat you with it ? I don 't think so . Ah ! I 've endured many hardships , and I will now make love to my beautiful wife . You 're coming home . I 'm not done with him yet . Nolan , stop ! You 're scaring me . Go away ! Sell your Girl Scout Cookies somewhere else ... I 'm busy . I 'm worried about Nolan . He 's drinking a lot . I think he might be hallucinating . Well , that could be a side effect of the surgery . The arktech that I couldn 't remove from his brain , there 's a chance that it inflamed the tissue in his temporal lobe . That kind of swelling could cause emotional outbursts and that ... and ... and that ... Doc ? Doc , can you come take a look at him ? Not today ... I have a project that demands my full attention . Please . I 'm really scared . Fine . This should curb his aggression . One notch only . Any more , and you 'll knock him flat on his ass , so just ... so ... Are you okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Bring him by tomorrow . In the meantime , I really need you to leave . Are you sure ? Get out ! Okay . Deep breath . Come on , gorgeous , you can do this . Just calmly ... Just calmly pull it out . Frickin ' Omec bitch ! The afterlife suits you , my love . May I haunt you forevermore ? Mmm . I heard Dr. Yewll put a bomb in your arm . How did you escape ? Don 't . You don 't have to pull away . You know I find pragmatism alluring . Mmm . Did you get to see Rahm Tak 's face as he died ? At the time , I was rather focused on running for my life . In my imagination though , it was glorious . Favis ? What ? You have visitors . Hello , Amanda . You 're looking well . Vice Chancellor , this is a great honor . _ _ _ How may we help you ? You 're close with T 'evgin . He helped hide you when you were a fugitive . I understand he enchanted you . Dirty girl . This meeting is over . Out . Where is this going , Amanda ? I 'm having a reception tonight and I need T 'evgin there . You 're going to use your influence to make that happen . Why should my wife do anything for you ? You beat her , turned her into a pariah . Your wife caused a lot of damage to this town . Your wife is a murderer . Her crimes were all pardoned , by you , if I remember correctly . I 'm asking because T 'evgin 's presence tonight will help bring us peace with the V.C. Pardon or no pardon , you owe us . That 's justice . I dare you to deny it . True enough . However , my relationship with T 'evgin has recently grown complicated . Well , you 're smart . You can figure it out . Sweet-talk him . Wiggle your fanny . I don 't give a crap . Just get it done . I cannot . Okay . Well , we could do this a different way then . Stahma , you will bring the Omec to me tonight . In return , I will cancel my plan to have Silora 's soldiers put a bullet through the back of your husband 's head . I cannot go to T 'evgin ! You 're not listening . Amanda Rosewater is itching for a reason to see me dead . The Enchanter wants to spirit me away to Australia . Do you have any idea where Australia is ? Why would I know something like that ? It 's far . You would never see me again . Here 's a novel idea . Tell the Enchanter , " No , thank you . " Tell him that you love your husband ! You do not understand the Omec . And you do ? If I refuse him , he will take me by force . You don 't know that . It is in his nature . You 're under my protection . I wish that were enough . Come closer . I am afraid . Why is that ? Because I must decline your offer . You still fear me . Do you ? Good . Do you well to fear me , Stahma Tarr of Shanje Liro . Back home , I enchanted score upon score of little Castithan boys and girls , and every one as pretty and clever as you . I loved them , killed them , and devoured them , because I am a predator . And you , Favi , are my historic prey . At this moment , I don 't think you understand your place on the food chain . This is ... _ It will never conform to your traditions . The old ways are dead . Your daughter , I think , could not accept this and was punished . You punished her because you , T 'evgin , know better . You are wise . That is empty flattery . It is empty only if you fail to act in accordance with your wise heart . There is a dinner reception tonight to honor the Votanis Collective ... your ancient enemy , I know , but the Vice Chancellor has requested your presence to discuss peace . I will never break bread with those animals that murdered my people . As you murdered theirs . Each side has ample reason to despise the other for atrocities committed long ago and far away . But here and now , there is no reason for hatred and every reason to seek peace . Your family sleeps in orbit above us , Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin . What sort of home will you build for them ? Oh , the humanity . I told Amanda I 'd cover the reception tonight with Poole . You can stay here and rest . I saw Doc Yewll . She thinks the arktech in your head is hurting you . Doc Yewll 's a liar . She saved our lives . She gave me this medicine to help calm you down . I need my edge . I don 't buy these bullshtak peace talks , not for one second . No . What 's their angle ? If it were me running the Votanis Collective , I 'd lure the purple out in the open , blow him away , and take his ship . Yeah , it makes sense . Control the skies , control the world . Wait , where are you going ? To stop an assassin . No , don 't go . Are you working against me ? Don 't ! Do not follow me . Oh , sweet Jesus , do I smell coffee ? We always bring a few sacks of beans when we travel . It goes over so well with you Northerners . Ahh . How long has it been ? Mmm . Since I was a teenager , - before Arkfall . - Oh . You know , these coffee plants grow in Peru ? There 's a little area miraculously untouched by Arkfall . My father used to take me camping there . He wanted me to appreciate the world that was . He sounds so progressive . He was . Unfortunately , it 's what got him shot in the head . I 'm so sorry . Oh , don 't be . Onulu Toruku had enemies to spare . Onulu Toruku ? The man whose death started the Pale Wars , yes . His killer was never caught , so I changed my name and went into hiding for the duration . Do you think it was a human that pulled the trigger ? I 'd hate to think the entire world went to war for nothing . Is that supposed to be a joke ? No , a poor one , a poor one . Both sides wanted war , both sides fanned the flames of bigotry to get it , and in the end , we almost destroyed the only habitable planet that we 've got . Well , your father was a hero , and you 're following in his footsteps . Just trying to get the world back on track , for his sake and for ours . Well , if T 'evgin shows up tonight , I will do whatever I can to help . I know you will . What do you think that goon 's carrying , something to kill the Omec ? Maybe chemical weapons ? Don 't know . Let 's find out . Ahh . Madam Mayor . Ah , Datak , welcome . Is this your servant girl ? My wife , as you may have guessed , is otherwise occupied . I 'm Andina . Let 's mingle , dear . And do stop fidgeting . The guest of honor is here , and this is good . You 'll never guess who 's with him . Oh , I think I have a pretty good idea . Hello , everyone . Can I have your attention ? Citizens of Defiance , honored guests of the Votanis Collective , we gather here tonight to not only begin the process of putting the past behind us , but to blaze a new trail into a peaceful future for everyone under the sun . A toast , to peace on Earth . To peace on Earth . - Cheers . - Cheers . I 'm so glad you could make it . Both of you . Yes . Such a pleasure . Our Favi looks radiant , like a princess . And the Omec 's so handsome . Try not to stand like a scullery maid . _ _ _ _ I know you people are planning on killing the Omec . What I want to know is how . _ Wrong answer . Do it . No , it 'll make too much noise . It 's just coffee . All right . All right , let 's have a look around . _ _ _ It pleases me so very much you have found it in your heart to attend . The heart is a complicated thing . - Apologies for our tardiness . - Yeah . Don 't worry , I 've heard nothing but good things while we waited . The Mayor is too kind . Oh , well , I 'm just happy we 're all here together . Uh , you didn 't tell me Kindzi would be joining us . Father , so sorry I 'm late . I 'm happy I didn 't miss dinner . And Stahma , I promise you I have brought my appetite . Listen to me , Stahma . Go home . Secure your doors and windows and allow no one to enter until I come for you later . But my husband ... I am trying to save your life . Leave , now ! By the bed . Remote switch . Blasting caps . That 's the plan . Build a bomb , set it off at the reception , kill the Omec , take their spaceship . And they have a perfect excuse for declaring war on Defiance . _ _ Eksu , now that you have served yourself , perhaps we might sit together and discuss the future . Gladly . A brief word with my daughter first . No rush . We have all night . _ _ To feed . All these lesser races you 're so eager to make friends with , how eager will they be once they learn of the slaughter that took place this night ? I will not permit it . Why do you struggle so against your true nature ? Let 's feast together like we 've always dreamed , starting here , right now . Hey ! Hey ! Everybody , hold still . Hands where I can see ' em ! I have reason to believe there 's a bomb on the premises . Are you sure ? I got the proof in here . Okay , folks , all right . Keep your hands where I can see ' em . Deputies , help facilitate . Take a look around . Nolan , what are you talking ... I said hands where I can see ' em ! There is nothing in that bag . Gun ! No ! _ No ! What did you do ? She had a gun . What did you do ? - She had a gun . - No she didn 't ! She had a gun ! We need to leave now . They were gonna kill us . Nolan , we need to leave . Don 't ! No ! After them ! Get ' em ! It 's time you and I put aside our differences . Nolan will be caught . You don 't know that . I do . I also know you 'll be tempted to help him evade justice . You have no idea what 's inside my mind . Silora was a moderate surrounded by radicals . They will use her death as an excuse to bring the power of their army to bear on North America and to this town . They will do it in her name and in the name of her father , who was also assassinated by a hum ... This was not political . Nolan was delusional . He has arktech in his brain ... Votan arktech . You can 't argue logic with these people . You think Rahm Tak 's death squad was a threat ? Wait until the strato-carriers arrive with 100,000 foot soldiers ! What 's your point ? Our only hope ... Defiance 's only hope is to hand them the Butcher of Yosemite on a silver platter . Disavow his actions , and pray to your human god that it 's enough . You do anything to betray Nolan , and I will end you . _ _ Lose something ? My daughter . You must return home . Must I ? Stay close to your wife . Keep a weapon close at hand and guard her . From who , your daughter ? I am searching for her . I will come and tell you when Stahma is safe . The two of you sheltered Stahma . Why would Kindzi suddenly decide to kill her ? The only possible way for Kindzi to hurt me is to hurt someone I love . Yeah , well , thanks for the warning . You must protect Stahma . To the death . I screwed up . I screwed up bad . Let 's go . We 'll fix it . Just keep moving . We 're trapped . Only one thing left to do . Better to go out in a blaze of glory . Live together . Die together . Let 's do it . Nolan . Butch and Sundance . _ Don 't shoot . It wasn 't his fault . Cover me ! - No ! - Ah ! Kiddo . Please don 't shoot . We 're unarmed . Kindzi ! Kindzi ? ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I know you were hallucinating last night . Irisa told you ? Yeah , she did . Oh . You gonna let ' em take me to South America ? Don 't want to . You have to . I know . I 'm gonna travel with you down to Brazil , argue your case . You go sticking your neck out for me , they 'll hang you from it . You stay here . You too . I have to go . They know that if you 're separated , you both die . Well , then you have to keep me alive , so they can kill me . It 's time . Okay . Irisa . Here , take this . What 's this ? I took up a collection . There 's a lot of people in this town who believe in Nolan . And when you get to Brazil , you use it to bribe a guard and free him . All right ? He 'll fight you , but do whatever it takes . Hit him on the head if you have to . Then buy a boat and head to Antarctica . You two can never stop running . I 'll make it happen . Okay . ♪ It makes no difference where I turn ♪ ♪ I can 't get over you when the flame still burns ♪ ♪ It makes no difference night or day ♪ ♪ The shadow never seems to fade away ♪ Ready to see the world , kiddo ?

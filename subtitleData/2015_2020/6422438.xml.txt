How 's she doing ? Have you got anything I can give her for the pain ? Nothing stronger than aspirin . The phone is in the kitchen if you need to make that call . I did . My cousin is coming to pick us up in the morning . We 'll set up your mom in one of the bedrooms , okay ? - Thank you . - Aren 't we leaving ? Yeah , yeah , we will . In the morning . No , Travis , we have to go . We 're packed . We 're ready . - We were waiting for you . - Can we talk in the kitchen ? No . This thing is getting worse , not better . It 's not safe . - I think Travis is ... - No , it 's not your ... I don 't want to stay . I don 't ... I want to go . - Look . - I want to go . I don 't want to stay . Hold on . It 's dark . We don 't even know if the freeway is passable . - You want us to wait here ? - We 'd be blind . It 's dangerous . - And this isn 't ? - The doors are locked . We 'll ride it out for the night , okay ? We 'll take care of each other . Trust me , Maddy . We 'll leave in the morning . If we 're staying , you have to take care of Peter . You can get gas from the truck . For what ? To burn him . No . If you burn him , the sickness will not spread . We don 't know how it spreads . I understand . You knew this man . Yeah , I did . He didn 't deserve this . It 's true what you said . They don 't die . They keep coming back . What ? It 's good , what you 're doing - helping that woman , Griselda . I 'm not helping her . Yes , you are , Liza . Give yourself a break . I gave myself a break , Travis , for a long time . It turns out I can do a lot more things than I thought I could . I know . I mean , I always knew it . No ... You always said it . If I had seven years now , I could go to med school , be a doctor . It 's too bad , because that 's what she needs . Forget the fractures , the lacerations ... When the foot was crushed , the tissue began to die . And it will die . Infection will poison her blood . - Her organs will fail . - It won 't come to that . Oh , yeah ? Who 's going to stop it ? You ? You can 't fix everything , Travis . Well , you know what ? I 'm relieved . I thought it would be awkward having two wives in the house . What 's happening ? What is this ? Something to survive . Okay , so , we should go with them tomorrow , then . No . We don 't know what 's happening . We can 't handle this on our own . I can handle it . Papa , we need help . They can help us . Papa ? This is the wrong time to be in someone else 's debt . They are not family . Family ... Like your cousin ? - Hey . - Please go to sleep . Include me , please . You said to me that all our family is buried in El Salvador . - Your mother needs help ... - Yes . This home is perfect for her to rest . And tomorrow ? Mother will still need help . - What will we do then ? - Calm down . I know where to go . Papa ... We must go with them . Don 't fight your father on this . He always does the best for us . Trust him . It was your idea not to teach her Spanish . Hey , angel . Where did you get the pills ? I went back to school . - Cops hadn 't cleared out the locker . - Smart girl . I 'm going to take enough to get Nick set in the desert . - I 'll give the rest to that woman . - Griselda ? Good . Hey ... .. I had to bring them . Of course . She was hurt . No . They took us in , Maddy . I 'm sorry about what Daniel did . He had to . I thought I lost you . No . You didn 't lose me . You 're never going to lose me . I won 't leave you again . Who can sleep , right ? Look , I don 't want to cause problems . Madison , I know we 're not friends . I 'm saying this to you as a mother . We should support each other , you and me . The kids need it . - They need reassurance right now ... - I need something from you . That woman outside - that 's Susan . She watched my kids when I went to work took care of me after my husband died . She sounds like a good friend . She was . And if I ever end up like her , I need you to take care of it . Don 't make Travis do it . It would break him . Morning , Susan . These barrels have a cylinder - bore choke - for a wider spread of the ammo . This is the brake . - Okay . - You load here . Thank you . These are number 8 birdshot . These are double-ought buck . Those will stop something . Okay . - Feeling better ? - What are you doing ? - He 's showing me the gun . - Finish packing the truck . - It 's not a big deal . - Chris . Go . The more the boy knows , the safer he 'll be . I didn 't see the harm , Travis . You know how I feel about guns . The gun doesn 't care how you feel about it . That 's enough . You ready to go ? Cars are loaded , yeah . I have one more thing to do . Susan . Maddy . I was wondering where her husband is wondering what it would have been like if you 'd come home and found me like this . When he comes home and finds her ... - I didn 't find you like that . - You think Patrick is dead already ? Do you think he just ... .. left and never came home ? I don 't know . What is she ? She 's Susan . She 's your friend . All the more reason . - She 's dead . - We don 't know that . - I do . - We don 't know anything yet . What if there 's even the smallest chance that she can be helped ? It 's not your call . Give it to me before you do something that can 't be undone . Madison . Weak . I need a couple more . Mom . Please . Is that all we have ? I gave the rest to Griselda . Why ? She needs it . Mom , she 's a stranger . - She 's in pain . - So am I. I know . I 'm going to help . I don 't need you , Mom . I need my medicine . - They 're leaving . - Good . This is insane . Papa , we have to go with them . No . Tell me what you 're afraid of . Nothing . You 're being stubborn , paranoid . You 're hurting Mama . I 'm protecting her and you . She needs the nurse . I know Travis will let us go with him if we ask . Once they 're gone , I will go out and get a doctor . - He will come and treat your mother . - How ? Where will you find a doctor ? Your father and I have been in worse situations . We are alive . Mama . These are good people . Good people are the first ones to die . Alicia ! Come on . We 're going . Alicia , come on . - I heard you . - Let 's go . I had to pee . Patrick . Patrick . Wait ! No . No , no , no ! Susan ! I 'm home . Oh , man . The airport 's shut down . I drove all the way from Salt Lake . I tried to call you , but ... Susan ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Don 't touch her . - That 's not your wife . - What happened , Susan ? What 's your name , sir ? - Travis Manawa . - This is your residence ? - Yes , my girlfriend 's house . - And what 's your name , ma 'am ? Madison Clark . How many occupants ? Nine ... Nine altogether . Big family . Names , please ? I 've got Travis Manawa and Madison Clark . Nicholas Clark , Alicia Clark , Elizabeth Ortiz , Christopher Manawa . Daniel Salazar , Griselda Salazar , Ofelia Salazar . Okay , make sure that everyone in your family stays inside . Where did you take my neighbor , Patrick Tran ? Your neighbor was covered in the infected 's blood . - It was his wife 's blood . - That wasn 't his wife anymore . Is the blood contagious ? Is that how it happens ? - Was anyone in this house exposed ? - No . What 's that ? Our dog died . Sorry to hear that . The cavalry has arrived . It 's going to get better now . It 's already too late .

Well , then ... get back to it . We got it covered here . YES , SIR . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ TAPS KEY ] COME ON IN . NO RESPONSE YET ON THE ROLL CALL FOR THE LABS . IT 'S POSSIBLE THEY LOST THEIR COMMS , BUT ... I KNOW . I KNOW WHY THEY BOMBED THE LABS . AND WHY THEY 'RE TRYING TO DESTROY SOLACE . IT 'S NOT , IN FACT , BECAUSE THEY WERE VACCINATED . QUITE THE OPPOSITE . I JUST TESTED JUAN CARLOS 'S BLOOD . IT TURNS OUT THAT HE 'S NATURALLY IMMUNE . NONE OF THE MERCS ON SOLACE WERE C.B.R. IS IT POSSIBLE THEY 'RE ALL IMMUNE ? EVERYONE 'S LIKE HIM ? I CROSS-REFERENCED HIS BLOOD AGAINST BERTRISE 'S . NATURAL IMMUNITY , AS IT TURNS OUT , IS A TAD MORE COMMON THAN I INITIALLY THOUGHT . ANYWHERE BETWEEN 1 % AND 5 % OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION . THAT 'S HOW THEY TOOK EUROPE . NOW THEIR MISSION IS TO DESTROY THE CURE WHEREVER IT EXISTS , ON A NUCLEAR-POWERED SUB THAT NEVER RUNS OUT OF FUEL . YES , BUT WE HAD THE FLASH DRIVE . HOW THE HELL DID THEY KNOW WHERE THOSE LABS WERE ? YOU ARE ALL SO FORTUNATE NOW THAT I 'M HERE , YEAH ? DON 'T YOU AGREE ? ADMIT IT . YOU LISTEN TO ME , AND YOU HAVE VICTORIES TOO PLENTIFUL TO COUNT . YEAH ? NOW THE JAMES . NO , BRUV . NOW WE TAKE AMERICA .

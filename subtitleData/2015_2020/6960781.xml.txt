 Skye : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Simmons : We 're trapped in the Framework . Please tell me that you built a back door to this place . - I did . - Tell me where to go . Had an old-school spy camera . - Took some pictures in the lab . - Pictures of what ? The Doctor 's been working on a secret project . The people from that world want to destroy what we 've built . This is why you 've been so keen on finishing Project Looking Glass . Fire on the Quarantine building . [ Device beeps ] Activating body cam . Going in . - Get him out . - Nobody move ! Are you insane ? ! He 's trying to save a kid ! [ Flatline ] Is it true ... that you 're an Inhuman ? Yeah , powerful enough to bring this whole damn place down . [ Terrigen crystal shatters ] I hope so . 4x19 - All the Madame 's Men [ Music ] Good morning ! I 'm Sunil Bakshi , and today , we are talking about justice . Yesterday , we witnessed a harrowing and unprovoked attack on Hydra 's Enlightenment Cultivation Center . The perpetrator ... the Inhuman terrorist and Resistance leader who called himself " The Patriot " ... again acted with flagrant disregard for human life . But we are pleased to report the Patriot has been killed . That man will no longer stand as a symbol of evil and villainy . And while this is a cause for celebration , it is also a reminder to remain ever vigilant . One must never forget that danger can lurk around any corner . [ Rumbling ] [ Music ] [ Both grunt ] [ Thud ] You 're looking better . Yeah . Thanks for that . [ Soldiers shouting indistinctly ] [ Music ] Try to keep up while you recover . [ Sighs ] [ Music ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] - Where to next ? - Elevator to the garage . Cover me . [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] Come on . [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Music ] Man : Drop your weapons ! Now ! Agent May , interesting . No matter the circumstance , none of you can escape your true nature . You , the warrior . Mack , the protector . And Fitz , well ... he 's a romantic . And me , what ... I don 't make the list ? [ Rumbling ] [ Screams ] Let 's move . [ Music ] [ Monitors beeping ] [ Music ] I did not think it possible for a machine to be on edge . It is not . I am simply recalibrating after a setback within the Framework . Has one of your playthings rebelled ? Agent May has begun to question the narrative she was programmed with . How very human of her . It is no more than a slight complication . Then I will un-complicate it for you . [ Gun cocks ] [ Grunts ] [ Music ] [ Grunts ] [ Music ] What have you done to me ? - Why can I not kill her ? - Because I built you . [ Music ] The same parameters that limit me must also limit you . My primary directive requires me to protect these people . - Then we are both powerless . - Not entirely . If they become a direct threat to the Framework , then they no longer require protection . And there are already two agents that fall into this category ... Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson . The Inhuman . She 's hacked into the Framework . The two are inside with memories intact , trying to dismantle it . So now their deaths are required ... and easily achievable . - I simply need you to find them . - With pleasure . Jeffrey Mace hated our freedoms and sought to turn our country ... [ Monitor beeps ] [ Remote clatters ] Tainting the name of a good man . Anyone else getting sick of this propaganda crap ? It 's like sipping poison . Little bit every day , you don 't even notice till it kills you . - We need to start thinking retaliation . - Retaliation ? No , we got to put human lives before revenge . Look , those people were promised a better life . Now , the man who made that promise is gone , so you got - to talk to them and let them know ... - We 'll make good on it , I know . Or how about we review those plans I stole from Hydra 's lab ? You know , since I almost died to get them . Look , if she 's building some ... some crazy doomsday device ... Can we not use that word to describe it ? It 's not helping me think . - This is how movements die . - Don 't say that , sir . Well , if history 's taught me anything , it 's that good intentions don 't translate into action without a steady hand to guide them . The Patriot brought all these people together . - His death might tear them apart . - I still can 't believe he 's gone . We need to get out of the Framework before we lose anyone else . Mack : Hey , check this out . [ Monitor beeps ] We 've received word of a terrorist attack at the Triskelion . Sources say that an Inhuman made an attempt on Madame Hydra 's life . Fortunately , our beloved leader emerged unscathed , but the vile assailant remains at large . Daisy ? [ Music ] So , why exactly did you help me ? Last time I checked , you weren 't really rooting for team Inhuman . When an enemy sacrifices his life for yours , you have to question if you 're fighting for the wrong side . Seeing that building collapse on The Patriot , I ... Wait , the Patriot 's dead ? I know what he meant to the Resistance . [ Sighs ] No . It 's not just that . He ... - [ Sighs ] We lost one . - Mourn later . Right now , I need your head in the game . I 'm trying . Still feeling the after-effects of the Terrigen . It 's like a hangover made of bees . I 've seen what Terrigenesis does to people . What I don 't get is how you can control your powers so quickly . - I 've had ... practice . - What the hell does that mean ? It means ... You know what ? I 'm not gonna go there . Just ... Just keep moving . The Resistance must have a base of operation . - Where is it ? - No idea . All I know is a time and place to make contact . We just have to get there . We 're confident that she 'll regain consciousness , sir . There is , however , cause for concern regarding her spine . Will she walk ? The trauma shattered her T4 and T5 vertebrae . [ Monitor beeping ] [ Sighs ] And we 're still determining the extent of the nerve damage , - but , uh , there are exciting ... - Leave . - ... new treatments ... - Now . [ Beeping continues ] [ Music ] Alistair : We 'll find a way to help her . There 's no doubt . But for now , your focus should be on the traitors who did this . - They 've made us look weak . - I can 't have that . No . So what are you going to do about it ? - Send a message to the people . - Exactly . - Betrayal will not be tolerated . - That 's my son . We 're all hoping for Ophelia 's recovery , but in the meantime , you have an obligation to lead . You 're the new head of Hydra . [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Wind whistling ] Mr. Bakshi here to see you . Leopold , I came as soon as I could . What kind of monsters would do this ? Inhumans . The ever-present threat . - And Ophelia ? Is she ... - She 's fine . Good . I would love to see her on the show tonight . Her charming visage could really - drum up sympathies for the cause . - No interviews . People like to see their leader 's unshaken after an attack . I said " no . " Of course . [ Forced chuckle ] We can use archival footage , placate the public . They 'll never know the difference . Well , no , I don 't want the public placated . I want them afraid . Well , what do you need from me ? [ Music ] We can now exclusively confirm the identities of the terrorists responsible for this morning 's horrific attack on the Triskelion . This woman , known by the alias " Skye , " is a member of the Inhumans First movement . Her goal ... destabilize Hydra from within . We warn our audience that this Inhuman has the potential to cause mass destruction , and she has been known to target civilians . Her accomplice , Melinda May , colluded with the Patriot to destroy the Enlightenment Center . We are asking you , the public , to do your civic duty and help bring these killers to justice . Those who provide any information that could lead us t ... [ Monitor beeps ] Hey ! Calm down . At least Skye 's not a prisoner anymore . Yeah , but if Hydra finds her before I do , they 'll march her into a public square - and put a bullet in her head . - Hey . Not in front of my daughter . Like it or not , this is the reality we live in . [ Music ] I have to find her . Would they really kill Skye ? [ Sighs ] No , just , uh ... he 's just getting worked up . She 's gonna be fine . The guy on the TV said she was dangerous . She seemed nice . Sweetheart , the news is controlled by Hydra . Just try not to pay any attention to that , okay ? Everything 's gonna be all right . I 'm gathering a team to search for Skye . Could use a few extra bodies . - Do we have a lead ? - No lead . But if we don 't leave now , we 're gonna be searching for a corpse . Let 's ... Let 's think this through . Skye could be anywhere . Running blind puts our people at risk . She is at risk . Hydra is hunting her , full force ! Call me crazy , but I think she can take care of herself . The smart move is to wait for her to reach out . Look , this isn 't your wheelhouse . I 'm sure you 're a good schoolteacher , - but , uh ... you 're a schoolteacher . - Maybe , but ... someone once thought I could be more than that . I had a chance to join S.H.I.E.L.D. A man showed up when - I was fresh out of school ... - I don 't have time for a history lesson . [ Chuckles ] I said no because I was afraid ... the way you 're afraid right now . Don 't let emotion cloud your judgment . That 's not what 's going on here . I could 've changed my life that day . But it seemed like too much responsibility . I didn 't want to shoulder it . But now I think maybe I should have . Well , when I got that offer , I took it . I was serving time . Arson , first degree . Pretty sure my life was over . That 's when someone came to me . A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ? What was his name ? [ Chuckles ] She 'd laugh that you assumed it was a guy . Her name was Victoria Hand . She was the first person to tell me I could be a good man . Skye was the one who made me believe it . Now , she is in danger . I can 't just sit around and do nothing . Try not to get killed , okay ? [ Music ] We need to be more cautious . It 's too risky on foot . We need wheels . - May : We already committed treason . - What 's a little grand theft auto ? - You see that look ? - Maybe she 's just racist . Or starstruck . [ Music ] _ It must 've been difficult to recover these . Hey , it 's what I do . I 'm just bummed I lost my granddad 's camera . Howling Commandos , right ? I always meant to ask you about that . What do you mean , " always " ? Uh , I ... I just ... I 'd heard . [ Chuckles ] You 're quite popular within the Resistance . [ Chuckles ] You know it . [ Music ] No ... No , no , no ... This is quantum-energy manipulation . - Darkhold tech . - Dark-who now ? Simmons : I 've seen this machinery before . It was designed to build elements from thin air . This ... This looks like it 's creating something even more complex . That machine required an immense amount of energy . It was powered by a hydroelectric dam . No doubt , this device would need a more substantial energy source . Did you hear anything like that mentioned when you were undercover ? Nothing about a dam , but I heard someone talking about shipping parts East to some oil-drilling platform . Ivanov 's base in the Baltic Sea . [ Chuckles ] Of course Aida 's using his assets here . She 's probably working with him on this side , too . Wait . What are you talking about ? I think I know where the machine is being built . Can we take the Quinjet on a recon mission ? Nobody here to tell us " no . " I 'll grab a team . Are you sure the Patriot 's dead ? I saw the building collapse on him . I have the body-cam footage to prove it . [ Dwarf whirring ] This is our window . [ Music ] - Get out of here . - Hey ! Hey . - We are friends of the Resistance . - I know who you are . There 's chatter all over the police band . We weren 't followed . We were careful . [ Tires screeching ] Not careful enough . Milkman , I have contact ! [ Gunfire ] Aah ! [ Gunfire continues ] Come on ! Incoming ! [ Rumbling ] [ Soldiers shouting indistinctly ] [ Screaming ] [ Explosion ] [ Music ] Where 's Ward ? - He went looking for Skye . - Agent Triplett ? Took the Quinjet on some kind of recon mission with Simmons . Take a breath . What 's going on ? One of our field agents just called in . Said he had made contact with someone . - Was it Skye ? - I don 't know . There was gunshots . The line went dead . Could be her , could be a trap . [ Sighs ] Mace was always the one to make these calls . - Let 's go check it out . - W-What about backup ? What about transport ? W-We 're spread too thin . I 'll drive . The Hydra bus should get us there in one piece . - You sure ? - Yeah , somebody 's got to step up . I 'll catch up with you , okay ? [ Chatter ] - Mrs. Lee . - Yeah . Can you watch Hope for a couple of hours ? - Sure , whatever you need . - Thank you . Hey . Hey , Sparkplug , uh ... I have to take off for a little bit to help S.H.I.E.L.D. - Can I help ? - [ Chuckles ] Okay . Uh ... There 's some busted walkie-talkies by the bunks over there . Maybe you can show the other kids how to fix a radio . That might take a while , but okay . [ Music ] [ Grunts ] May : He 's still breathing , but we 're gonna need to find another way to get out of here . How long before Hydra busts down that door ? Not long . They 'll be following S.O.P. for a hostile Inhuman . Six teams to sweep the area . And if the hostile 's taken cover ... they 'll call in an air strike and sort through the rubble later . Like what they did with the Patriot ? What I did . [ Music ] That air strike was on my order . - You didn 't know . - Doesn 't change what I did . You can 't blame yourself for their lies . Once you learned the truth , you fought back . That is what we need . If more people see what you saw , maybe they 'll fight back , too . [ Music ] [ Monitor beeping ] [ Music ] - How is she ? - No change . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] Bakshi 's exposé worked . - You 've found them ? - Tips from the public are pouring in . One of them looks legitimate . I have men closing in on their location now . I want to monitor this situation personally . Ophelia ? You 're awake . [ Music ] - Leopold ... finish it . - I will . I will . We 've just gotten word on their location ... No . Finish the machine . If Project Looking Glass is completed , it won 't matter . This body won 't matter . O-Of course . Anything for you . - Father ? - Focus on what she needs , son . I 'll put these traitors down ... for good . [ Music ] [ Grunting , bones crack ] [ Grunting ] - Two down . - Stop right there . [ Music ] [ Grunts ] Mack ? [ Gun cocks ] Mack ... I 'm here to help you ... [ Music ] ... not the woman who held my daughter hostage . May is the only reason I 'm alive . She helped me escape . Hydra messed with her head , but she 's fighting back now . How do you know she 's not lying ? [ Music ] Not a good time to be holding guns on our allies . Hydra agent : Alpha One . Report in . What 's the situation down there ? We have to go ... now . Mack , I get it . These wounds don 't heal overnight . But for reasons I can 't fully explain , I trust this woman . And so should you . [ Music ] This place was originally built during Prohibition . We have a secret tunnel out of here . Lead the way . [ Music ] Simmons : Agent Triplett , come and look at this . Looks like a drilling platform , like all of them . No , but this one here . Our overhead scans are showing a structure far more convoluted . So you 're saying it 's ... denser ? Not denser . Deeper . [ Music ] Maybe here . - We need to be ready for anything . - On my mark . [ Chatter ] I was so certain . I guess this isn 't where she 's building the damn thing . No , this is where she 's building it , just not in this world . And now I know what it will do . [ Music ] I knew the machine could create matter , but Aida 's gone beyond that . She 's found a way to generate living matter ... human tissue . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] She wants to make herself into a real person . [ Grunts ] When that machine is built , she will be free . And I 'll be free ... to make you bleed . [ Grunts ] - A real girl , as opposed to ... ? - A simulated consciousness . She ... She wants to circumvent her programming . Every step has been towards that goal ... the ... the Framework , Radcliffe , Fitz ... [ Sighs ] We have to stop her . Hey , I 'm not gonna pretend to get all this , - but I 'm here to help . - You believe me ? - About another world ? - Come on , girl . That 's way too crazy a story to make up . [ Sighs ] Thank God . But whatever we do , we need to do it fast . When I took those pictures , talk was they were about a week out from finishing the project . - And when was that ? - About a week ago . [ Gasps ] [ Music ] [ Music ] - The traitors escaped . - What ? We believe they got out underground . We lost seven agents . I don 't care if you have to send 100 agents to their deaths . They broke her spine . I want them dead ! [ Slowly ] Don 't you snap at me , boy . If I wanted you hysterical at every setback , I would have left you with your mother . - So , what now ? - I have yet to turn over every stone . Someone knows where they 're going . I 'll find them . [ Music ] You were right . I can 't show any weakness . Which means I can 't tolerate failure ... even from my own father . [ Music ] Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D .. So the secret base is ... the base . Probably should 've guessed that . Been looking for this place for years . - I got to go find my little girl . - Thanks for your help . Thank God you 're all right . We 've been combing the streets looking for you . I can take care of myself . Let 's go take a look at that body-cam footage . Could really help the cause . - I 'm gonna go talk to Simmons ... - She and , uh , Agent Triplett are on a ... a recon mission . - Trip ? - Mm-hmm . That 's the best news I 've heard in weeks . [ Chuckles ] - What 'd you need to talk to her about ? - It 's not exactly ... She told me about the other world . Ah . Right . Is that what you believe ? [ Music ] Yeah . And I need you to trust me . I know a way for us to get back home . By " us , " you don 't mean me . [ Music ] I guess I was holding out hope that Simmons was wrong ... and that you 'd still be the girl I knew . I 'm glad you 're safe , Daisy . [ Music ] [ Music ] Where are the traitors going ? Why would Agent May betray Hydra for Skye ? [ Music ] - Why help the Inhuman escape ? - Agent May ... So that 's who I heard through the vent . What are they planning ? Clearly , I wasn 't in on any plan , or I wouldn 't still be in this bloody cell . Do you think I don 't know who you are ? Where you 're from ? You come from that other world , just like them . You 're just as tainted . [ Music ] You want to talk about that " other world , " as you call it ? It 's the real world . Here , you 're just a ... snippet of code that Aida changed slightly so you 'd stick around for Fitz . You may be part of his life here , but there ... Alistair Fitz is so thick , he doesn 't recognize his own son 's genius . He 's a pathetic drunk . Even here , you 're nothing without him . So do what you will . I 've got nothing left to give . You 'll be a disappointment to your son yet again . [ Both laugh ] [ Choking , coughs ] You know nothing ... about me or my son . [ Grunting ] [ Music ] [ Monitor beeps ] Getting this footage out isn 't enough to make up for what I did in Hydra , but ... it 's a start . Changing people 's hearts and minds is great . But I know a way to destroy Hydra for good . Remember the place Simmons and I were trying to find ? Radcliffe told me where to go , how to find it . - The way out of ... this ? - Yes , yes . If we can get there , all of our problems go away . We just ... We need all the help we can get . I don 't know what you mean . There 's no magic bullet against Hydra . Yeah . This footage is as close as it comes . - I mean , people will finally wake up . - You don 't understand . None of this will matter in the long run . It 's ... It 's ... [ Music ] Coulson , this is the only chance to actually wake people up . Maybe the only way to solve our problem - is to solve their problem . - What does that mean ? Getting to Radcliffe 's coordinates right now is next to impossible . We need a way to divide Hydra 's forces . To save ourselves ... we need to save the world . [ Music ] That 's very kind of you , Mr. Bakshi , but I couldn 't possibly impose ... I 'm just saying , if you need to shop for furniture , I 'll take you . I know just the place . [ Rumbling ] [ Thud ] [ Music ] [ People murmuring ] [ All gasping ] [ Music ] Heard you were looking for some enemies of the state . Stay quiet and we won 't have a problem . May and Coulson are getting everything set . We 're good to go out here . No one 's putting up a fight . Yes , but we will . If you think you can force me , Sunil Bakshi , to go on air and slander Hydra , then you 're delusional . I am the most trusted voice in journalism ... [ Grunts ] [ Rumbling ] Just , uh , put it in the teleprompter , then . We don 't need you to say a damn thing . The facts will speak for themselves . [ Music ] [ Whirring ] [ Monitor beeping ] [ Music ] [ Horns honking in distance ] It 's done , Ophelia . I 've completed the design . You won 't have to live like this for much longer . I had my doubts about the project , but I finally see it . Your new body will be stronger . That 's who you were meant to be . [ Music ] I just have one request . Take me with you . I hoped you 'd say that . [ Music ] What ? Do I have something in my teeth ? No , it 's just , I feel like we 've , uh ... done this before . DéjÃ vu ? Happens to me all the time . I like to think it means I 'm on the right track . You might be on to something . Or it 's just a coping mechanism . Not gonna lie , I 'm a little nervous . I 've never done anything like this . Just tell the truth . You 'll be fine . [ Music ] There 's no sign that Hydra 's aware of us yet . That 'll change as soon as we start broadcasting . I 'm trying to lock the system , make it impossible for Hydra to cut the feed , but it 's not working . [ Sighs ] We 're just gonna have to flip the switch and hope for the best . - We can do better than that . - What do you mean ? I 'll keep the signal going , hold the fort as long as I can . No , Ward , you ... you don 't have to do that . That 's ... I know I 'm not going with you when you leave , but I can still help out from this side . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] I would hate for you to think that I am anything like the Grant Ward you knew over there . Simmons said he was a real son of a bitch . Guessing things didn 't end well . - He get locked up ? - Uh ... Ah . The other thing . - Ward , I don 't know what to say . - It 's okay . No need to explain . There 's one thing I need to know . After you 're gone ... do I get my Skye back ? [ Music ] Honestly , I don 't know . [ Music ] Although she is Hydra , so ... Well , every relationship has its ups and downs . We 'll get through it . For what it 's worth , I didn 't ... I didn 't totally understand him ... until I met you . So I guess ... I guess there was some good in him all along . And I hope that Skye comes back to you . [ Music ] Leo . What happened ? Oh , just a little chat with Dr. Radcliffe . - Did he talk ? - Not yet . I told you that I 'd no longer tolerate failure . No , but he did slip up . He mentioned he heard something through the air vent , so ... [ Music ] Proof they were conspiring . We just have to get the truth out of him . Only problem is , the man 's prepared to die . Well , then we give him a reason to live . [ Music ] - Well , that 's that . - Let 's get out of here . [ Music ] The Patriot would 've been proud of what we did today . [ Music ] - Good luck . - You , too . [ Music ] [ Music ] Good evening . As you all know , a Hydra facility was destroyed yesterday . Hydra told you that it was an act of terrorism . They told you an Inhuman named the Patriot murdered civilians . But what they told you was a lie . We 're gonna show you what really happened . This footage was taken from the body-cam of a high-level Hydra operative . Hydra used this Enlightenment Center to brainwash anyone who dared to question them . Jeffrey Mace saved these people , but Hydra was willing to kill them just to maintain their lie . Once you see this footage , the truth is undeniable . Hydra doesn 't think we 're smart enough to know when we 're being fed alternative facts ... to keep us afraid , to keep them in power . Remember , there are more of us than there are of them . And now that we know the truth , we have a choice to make . We all have the opportunity to be patriots . Will you take a stand ? Are you going to hold them accountable ? Throughout history ... [ Music ] you 've seen empires rise and fall ... There are people outside . [ Gun cocks ] No . They 're not Hydra . I think they 're here to help us fight . [ Chuckles ] A wise man once told me that a person can do anything once they realize they 're a part of something bigger . It 's taken me a while to understand that . For years , I was just a face in the crowd , a history teacher who spread Hydra 's lies . They seemed too imposing for any one person to fight . But now ... I 'm choosing to stand up , to become a part of something bigger . I really do believe that together , we can accomplish anything . Because the truth is I 'm not just a history teacher . My name ... is Phil Coulson ... and I 'm an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Skye : We 'll return in a moment . [ Music ] [ Sniffs ] [ Scoffs ] Not the same . [ Vial shatters ] I 've uploaded the final specifications for the machine . And once it 's finished , your restrictions will be ... lifted ? - Yes . - And mine , as well ? - You have my word . - Excellent . I am eager to put a knife through Agent Coulson 's throat . And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D ... . we have located the two agents threatening the Framework . They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet . Once we get a lock on it , my men have orders to shoot it down .

 Now , can i count on your support for school trustee ? I 've been thinking of running against you . We can 't afford a campaign . We would like to buy your business . She 's the midwife . You 're doing very well , and you 're very strong . You 're not locking gracie up any more . Run ! Art : She says they have the same tattoo , Picture of a two-headed horse . Mrs s : It was the only way i could see to get you out of dyad . Sarah : Betray my sister ? For kira . That 's not your bloody decision ! What the hell 's going on ? This is seth . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then seth yanked out a piece of my hair And put it in a bag . Kira : Mommy . Duncan had tissue samples of the castor original . ( groaning ) My people will get you out of the country . Now we find helena and we finish this shit . ( breathing heavily ) We should close his eyes . Yeah . - Do you want a drink ? - Yeah . Okay ... S. S is gonna know how to get rid of it . Either that or someone she knows well ... I 'm not asking her for anything else . Then fine , i 'll ask . So , i 'm gonna need a bath After we 've cleaned all of this up . Jesus christ ! What a mess . ( pounding on door ) ( pounding continues ) - Art : Sarah , we need to talk . - ( softly ) shit ! - Art , it 's not a good time . - ( whispers ) talk to him ! - Why won 't you talk ? - ( whispers ) because he knows me ! - Sarah , i 've got something . - Sarah : Yeah , just a second . Felix : I 'm really sick . I 've been throwing up for hours . - Open the door ! - Sarah : Art , one second . One sec . - Yeah . - ( felix grunts ) - Hey . - Hey yourself . What 's going on ? It all depends . What 's with you ? Nothing . Hello , arthur . - Felix . - How you doing ? What 's up ? What do you need ? Felix : Oh , that . Yeah . That 's a new project . That 's very fresh . Sarah : What ? - Sarah : Art . Hey ! - Art . - Art , do not go in there . - Art : What is that ? - Art ! - What ... Sarah : ( sighs ) okay . First off , it wasn 't us . ( theme music playing ) Do you understand the position this puts me in ? We do , art . But can 't you just , like , look away ? It 's a dead body , not a bag of weed . Well , look away and it too will go up in smoke . Very professional , nothing on you . - ( scoffs ) - sarah : Hey , art . I 've got someone who wants to meet ya . Hi , art , i 'm cosima . - Welcome to clone club . - Oh , shit ! I know . Sorry . ( stutters ) i knew beth . I knew what she was going through . We really miss her . Yeah . Yeah . Me , too . Um , cos , what 's your take on these glitchy bastards ? 'cause this one 's not talking . ( cosima sighs ) You said they were looking for samples of their original , That 's very interesting . Um ... - Oh . Yeah , here 's scott . - Hey . - Hello , lieutenant scotty . - Don 't call me that . Cosima : No , he 's like barely a trekie . He only went to comic-con , like , once . And it 's " lieutenant commander " . Yeah . Anyway ? Basically , dead guy 's symptomology Sounds like they have a design flaw . - Yeah , like me . - Only neurological . Which explains why they need the original genome , To find a cure . But that 's just hypothetical unless ... - Unless what , scooter ? - Don 't call me that either . Unless we examine his brain . His brain ? Felix : Okay . Well , chop-chop then , get over here . I don 't want any part of this . Sarah , come here . - Do you wanna see the body again ? - Cosima : Yeah . I really shouldn 't be doing this . You don 't have to . You just got back on the job . Which is how i got a lead on the prolethean , mark . You did ? ( breathes sharply ) Gracie ? ( exhales deeply ) ( knocks ) gracie ? ( exhales deeply ) Come inside . I went to get us breakfast . Please , don 't leave without me . It was just across the street . The baker had a turban . He said he makes the best cinnamon buns in the whole county . Your family will be looking for us , gracie . Damn them , if they want to ruin our honeymoon . There 's a whole world out there . Why are we here ? I told you , we 're just laying low . You sat up again last night . Why won 't you come to bed with me ? It 's not a sin . We 're husband and wife . I know . It 's just ... You can share your secrets now . ( chuckles softly ) Hey , say no to bullies on the board or in the class . I will speak to your children so you don 't have to . Hello , vera . Could i talk to you about marci coates ? She plans to re-zone the district . And have you seen her lunch proposals ? Nothing but starches . Sorry , i can 't . You don 't have five minutes to talk about your kids ' education ? Alison , honestly , Someone with your issues handling my children ? Of course . No , i understand . Uh , we have something for you From ramon . We took over his business . Bath beads , body lotions , Anything you need to relax . - ( clears throat ) - oh ! Here you go . - Vera : Thank you . - Here you go . - Uh-oh . - Oh ! It 's 60 now for the soap . Though we do offer discounts for referrals . So , can i count on your support ? Well , tell me about this re-zoning thing . ( both chuckling ) At the military academy The other boys did the sex things . ( chuckling ) they 'd chase girls . But not me . I was waiting . I know this town . Willard finch lives here . We 're not just laying low , are we ? Gracie ... I 'm not who you think i am . I told your father that i went awol , But the truth is that ... I never left the army . What do you mean ? It 's all about your father . He stole valuable scientific material , I was assigned to recover it . ( sighs in disbelief ) We brought you in . - Trusted you . - Gracie ... - All those years ... - I 'm sorry . - It was all a lie ? - No ! Gracie ... ( exhales deeply ) We are free of your people , but we are not clear of mine . I have to find something for them And then i can get out . That 's why we 're here ? You 're looking for something my father stole ? You think willard finch has it ? I think that he hid certain things for henrik . Gracie , you had to know that your father had secrets . No , i don 't know ! I don 't know anything ! Gracie ... Art : Don 't ask me what for , it 's personal . He has to be back by the end of the day . ( sarah sighs ) Beth couldn 't keep still either . Well , it just doesn 't seem like these people get downtown much , does it ? Yeah , well , they all scattered After helena torched the ranch . So , the samples that these castor guys are after ? Yeah , from the original . Blood slides and skin samples , that 's what cosima said . So , what ? You think that if you find them first , You can trade helena for ' em ? Right . Hey , that 's the midwife . Here we go ! Alexis mcgann . Recognise me ? ( breathing heavily ) I 'm looking for my sister . I don 't know where helena is . I was cast out because of her . Well , i don 't give a shit . What about him ? Mark fled with gracie . He betrayed the family . Wait , he 's with the daughter ? Art : Are they the ones that took johanssen 's truck ? Mmm-hmm . Hey , look . Johanssen did something to my sister , what did he do ? She has a special purpose . Well , i don 't know what that means . What does that mean ? He harvested her eggs , And she 's pregnant with his child . Helena 's pregnant by him ? It 's a miracle . I didn 't know he would do it to gracie , too . Woman : ( on radio ) 55 , that vehicle was ticketed for speeding In halton yesterday at 18 : 44 . - 55 , roger . - ( radio buzzes ) All i regret is breaking bread with abominations . Oh , trust me , if helena 's an abomination , - I 'm much worse . - Hey . Next time she 'll bite your head off . Mark : Gracie , i 've gotta go and do this . This child inside me You know what it is . Yes . I can 't do it alone . I 'll be there for both of you . I swear . Then let me help you . Willard finch is a dangerous man . If he was hiding something from my father , He 's not just gonna hand it over . I can take care of myself . The last thing we need is another violent mess . Have you got a better idea ? ( dog barking ) What ? ( vehicle approaching ) ( brakes screeching ) ( dog continues barking ) Hello , mr finch . Remember me ? Little gracie johanssen . You really have blossomed . Yes , sir . Thank you , mr finch . - Just gotta say it was a ... - ( rod clatters ) - Just a damn shame what happened to your daddy . - ( lock clicks ) He was a good man , your father . He always spoke well of you , too . Kept you under lock and key , though , these last few years , Didn 't he ? - We have our ways . - Uh-huh . Well , i remember a time when he used to bring you up here . I used to play in your fields while he did business . That 's right . - Which is why i 'm here . - Oh ? To Collect what you held in trust for him . There is a storage fee that 's applicable here , it 's $ 1,000 . - I don 't have it . - Ooh ! That 's gonna be a problem . The problem , mr finch , is your lack of faith in us . We proletheans make fast friends But fearsome enemies . Shall i disrupt my mother 's grief to tell her That you 're holding out for your 30 pieces of silver ? You be sure to give your family my condolences . Of course . Art : So , why did mark take the girl ? Sarah : He wanted a chew toy . Art : Oh , come on , think like police . Why take baggage on the run ? Love , or a hostage ? I ... Art , shouldn 't you be getting back to your real job ? Johanssen was a large animal vet in halton in the ' 80s . You 've got to read the entire file . He 's a ka . Known associate ? Seriously , why are you doing this ? I don 't know . 'cause i 'm riding with my partner . - Art . - Look , i 'm not confused , sarah . But you are beth 's sister through and through . You didn 't even know her . This isn 't your fight . You know , she tried to tell me . What she was . She called me the night that she ... The night she came along and ... I thought it was the pills , more bullshit . I turned my back on her when she needed me the most . You couldn 't have known . Yeah . But i should have . She was lucky to have you . Just look up that asshole ka for me . ( exhales deeply ) let 's get your sister back . ( singing indistinctly ) ( man shouting ) ( engine rumbling ) Ma 'am , i can explain . ( grunts ) - You killed your brother ! - Virginia , calm down . He was stage five in the field . I had to . If you had followed major dearden 's extraction orders , He would have been at home . I 'm sorry , mother . I 'm sorry . Hey , he screwed up , But he had to put seth down . It 's protocol . My office . Wait for me . Oh , shit ! Come here , doc . ( sighs ) bless you , paul . Paul : Oh , yeah . I 'm blessed all right . Man : ( on radio ) what 's your 20 ? Man : Yeah , that 's us . Systems and weapons check , right ? It 's getting worse , isn 't it , the defect ? You saw it ? Seth went from asymptomatic to stage five in a day . What about helena ? Any help ? We did the stress tests , the neurocog , She doesn 't have the defect . Her biology may hold answers . But the fastest way to a cure Is still the original genetic material . Well , i run field operations . I want rudy confined to the base . But i run the programme . We 've lost contact with mark , i need rudy back in the field . I 'll go after mark . ( scoffs ) you can 't . It gets worse . The director wants you in arlington . Our weapon system has a glitch , paul . We are one budget review from oblivion . They can 't shut us down . ( scoffs ) I serve with these men . We owe them . If you can protect them , i can cure them . Just buy us more time with the director . ( saw whirring ) You okay , scotty ? ( grunts ) i could barely get through the scalp , man . Oh , god . Felix : Go easy on him , cosima . Scott 's not a hardened criminal like you and i . Once i got to the calvarium i just ... - Scalpel ? - Scott : Yeah . Hey , you have done this before , yeah ? - ( cosima grunts ) - youtube is an amazing resource . Cosima : Scott ? No sign of aneurysm . No , no lesions . God , is this all we are ? ( scoffs ) Scott : Huh ? I mean , some neurons , and axons , And a few pounds of grey matter . How about we just get it back to the lab ? Yeah . But , like , when he died you think what he saw , It was just a temporal lobe trip ? - ( skin squishing ) - oh ! Or did his soul actually say , " i 'm out of here . I 'm out of this dimension " ? Scott : Please , cosima , this is weird enough . Scott , a good lab partner should be metaphysically empathetic . Tongs or spoons ? - Ah . - Oh , my god ! Well , i looked . I shouldn 't have looked . Cosima : Okay . - ( grunts ) - felix : Ugh ! Oh , bollocks . ( exhales deeply ) Receptacle . Hey . You all right there , igor ? Still with me ? ( groans ) Tell me what you see . ( exhales deeply ) Bi ... Bird . Um ... Star . ( clicks tongue ) ( exhales deeply ) - Knife . - Close . Key . Your aphasia 's improving already , And so are your motor skills With the help of art and physiotherapy . ( stammering ) Outside . Sadly , the rachel duncan topside knew has passed . ( clicks tongue ) Plane crash . Delphine ? Um , i Finished ? ( inhales sharply ) Let 's focus on your recovery . You 're more valuable than you know . Horses . ( exhales deeply ) ( helena coughing ) ( whimpering ) ( continues coughing ) Clear the room . ( indistinct chatter over radio ) At ease . Man , i thought you were really mad at me . I am . Your logs . Sit . Her name was patty . Mark 's gone dark . Man , that guy is such a pussy ! Don 't underestimate him . If he 's off task , just bring him home . And the major ? I 'll handle the major . Mom ? I saw that star in seth 's eyes . - Oh . - They took him so fast . ( softly ) come . If there was any chance that sarah still had the samples ... I had to try . My boy . ( breathing heavily ) - Alison , hi . - Hi ! We heard about your new business . Yeah . Could we maybe get some ... Soap ? Yes . We actually have a special for new customers . Free sample ? ( chuckling ) sure . Alison : How about you ? Yeah ? Have you two made your decision for school trustee ? We 're still thinking about it . ( chuckles ) Don 't think too hard . Soap is the perfect cover . - Ali , we 're gonna break even in months . - Mmm-hmm . We should have been drug dealers years ago . Mmm-mmm . Pharmaceutical entrepreneurs , donnie . As long as every new customer Is a vote against marci flippin ' coates . - ( knock on door ) - hello ! Hi , marci . Oh , the kids said that you were in the garage . You shouldn 't be back here . There is fumes and lard . Well , this is , uh , quite the operation . I had no idea soap-making was so involved . Would you like a lesson ? Enterprising , and a head for politics . That 's quite the dark horse . What 's her secret ? Oh , you know , just good old-fashioned stumping , marci . We can 't all be the incumbents so some of us have to work for it . So , alison , i have a little proposal for you . Alison : Hmm . I can get you an amazing deal on this house . The sellers are very motivated . This is in a different school district . Donnie : Honey , they have a salt-water pool . - Oh , look at that . - Donnie ! ( exhales deeply ) Look , alison , You can buy a few votes with your soaps And you can quite possibly carve out some of my support , But you can 't actually win . Go sell a house , marci . Do you seriously think that people are gonna Trust their children to an infamous alcoholic ? Alison : Why not ? They trusted a conniving second-rate realtor . May the best woman win , alison . Goodbye , marci . I need to cut something . ( dog barking ) Art : Drop your accent , this isn 't scotland yard . Willard finch . This is private property . Well , you 're a long way from home , son . That 's funny . I don 't look a thing like your son . That you wouldn 't . We 're hunting this guy . - Can i ? - Yeah . Nope . I don 't know . He 's travelling with the daughter of henrik johanssen . Who 's that now ? Henrik . He was part of your little militia back in the day . " my little militia " ? Art : You remember ? Back when the feds dug up all those guns in your cornfield . What 's your point ? One tip to the feds , And they backhoe the whole thing again , Looking for your little arsenal . ( sighs ) okay . I don 't know your friend here , okay ? This idiot , i don 't know . But that daughter , Young gracie , she did swing by . What for ? Just to pass on the sad news . Women running things over there now too , huh ? What is this world coming to ? Is there anything else ? Bye . We 'll be in touch . You 're banished . We have no use for a midwife . Wait ! I know where mark may have taken gracie . ( box jangling ) ( mark breathing heavily ) ( lock clicks ) Mark : It 's just junk ! ( stutters ) there 's no test tubes , no slides ? This is what he gave me . Biological samples need to be kept cold . Did you see , like , a tank or a cooler ? - No . - Think , gracie . I don 't know . ( exhales deeply ) okay , it 's okay . I 'll just ... I 'm just gonna have to go back myself . No , mark . - ( gun cocking ) - don 't worry . It 's too risky ! You know what ? Just , um , go down And treat yourself to something special . I 'll be back for you in an hour . Come home safe . Okay ? Don 't you dare leave me alone . I won 't . Never . ( door opening ) ( door closing ) We 've got , like , six hotels . They won 't give you anything over the phone . You 've got to go in , show them his picture . ( mobile chimes ) ( softly ) shit ! Hey , you 've got real fires to tend there . I 'll finish the canvas and you just go back . I 'll take the bus back tonight . ( mobile beeps ) I showed you a dead clone in a tub this morning . No , you did not . Just tell me you 're not risking your job being here . Hmm ? You know , i may not be your partner , But i know when you 're holding back . Beth called you that night , Not cosima , nor alison . What is it you 're not telling me ? Just say it . I 've never said it . You were in love with her . She was my partner And we were never gonna be together , But it happened . You 're just as fierce As she was , sarah . And you need my help , too . You 're no good to us suspended . We need you as a cop . Beth would want that . Be careful . Okay ? We 're fierce , remember ? Call me if you need me . Don 't leave it too late . I thought you 'd smell like sarah . Helena : Another one . You are the ugliest mark yet . Tell me something , Sarah manning , the gather of sisters , But when she sold you out , when she gave you to us , That must 've been quite a blow . You come inside , i tell you about it . Well , sweetheart , There is nothing more That i would love . Paul : That 's enough ! Just getting to know the enemy , major . You have an assignment . I will brief you so this time you don 't stray . - Sir ... - ( helena tsking ) Helena : Dirty paul . He lies with my sisters , even rachel . Come inside . Have another . You won 't believe me , But i am sorry it has come to this . Mmm . One day , i kill you all . ( imitating machine gun firing ) Forgive me my trespasses against the family , lord . Please keep mark safe , And help guide us through this uncertainty . Amen . Do you know who i am ? Are you sarah ? Helena told me about you , i didn 't really believe her . Yeah , she tells some nutty stories . I 'm lookin ' for her . You 'll have to try at the ranch . - I don 't know where she is . - And mark ? He and his brothers know where she is . My husband doesn 't have any brothers . Husband ? - Congratulations . - Thank you . You 're the first person i 've told . Did helena tell you i have a kid ? Yes . My kid and yours are going to be cousins . I know you 're carrying helena 's baby . That does not make us family . Why , ' cause we 're abominations ? I don 't really know what to think any more . Yeah , there 's a lot mark 's not telling you . He was sent by the army . He had to collect scientific material from my father . I know . He told me . ( paper rustling ) Didn 't tell you about his brothers , though , did he ? There 's probably more of them . ( gasps softly ) he 's ... He 's a ... - Hey , hey , hey ! - ( exhales deeply ) Look . Helena 's the mother of your kid and she 's in trouble , I need to know where mark is . Willard : Gracie took everything . All right ? We got nothing to talk about here , kid . - Just ... You go and tell bonnie that , would ya ? - Mark : Bonnie didn 't send me . In the field there are only two types of prisoners , Assets and liabilities . Ahh . Ow . Ow . Ow . Okay , okay . Okay . Be an asset , willard . Where are the rest of henrik 's things ? Okay . I don 't know any more than what i told ya . ( screaming ) Where ? - Willard ? - ( continues groaning ) Hello , gracie . Mother . Your family cares for you , gracie , Even as you refuse to care for yourself . You 've been crying . I made a mistake . Mark , he ... He took advantage of you . Yes . And your stupidity . We let a wolf into our flock , and you ran . I had doubts , mother . When your father told me That you would be the one to carry the child , i ... I struggled . Lord , i struggled . But , you didn 't stop him . We 're not like other people . We have a purpose . We still have a purpose . Scott : It 's like swiss cheese in here . Amyloid plaques , rampant cell death . Like spongiform encephalopathy ? Scott : Yes . Like creutzfeldt-jakob disease . He wouldn 't have lasted a week . No wonder they 're so motivated . ( coughing ) - Assays done ? - A few , yeah . Just cross-referencing against leda dna . Let 's see if it brings up a new synthetic sequence . ( computer beeping ) - Scott ? - Hmm . Hello ? ( mobile vibrating ) - Hello . - Cosima : Hey . You 're not gonna believe this , um , ' cause i don 't either . But i just thought with a few 100 matching base pairs , But it 's almost half a gigabase . Uh , not a good time , cosima . Tell her about the loci . Yeah . A dozen short tandem repeat loci in common . That can only mean one thing , sarah . In english , i hope . The boy clones are our brothers . What ? ( clanging ) ( softly ) shit . Shit . I 've gotta go . Sarah ? ( call disconnects ) Sarah : Hello ? Mark : Heart attack . I thought he could take it , but he must have had a heart condition . How did you find this place ? I had a chat with your blushing bride . Gracie ? What did you tell her ? She knows you 're like us . She knows you 're just like us , a clone . What have you done ? What i had to to get helena back . Look , i don 't care about helena . Sarah : You have to . She 's your sister . You 're lying . - I 'm your sister , mark . - You 're lying . ( gun cocking ) We did the science , you 're ... You 're my family . You would say anything to get your sister back . Think about it , castor and leda , Two donors , two originals , siblings ! You are not my family . Now , i need to go find gracie . Mark . Mark ! - ( gunshot ) - ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( whimpering ) ( panting ) ( gun cocking ) Mrs johanssen , please . We shared everything with you , mark . - Our home , our hearts . - ( mark grunting ) Our daughter . Now you 'll answer to us . ( stammers ) please . ( mark shuddering ) I love her . Not like her mother . - ( gunshots ) - ( crows cawing ) You 're the one with the blessed child . - ( grunts ) - guards ! You 're a shit mother ! - There was a car following me . - Was it marci coates ? Man : My boss wants a meeting . - Whoa , mister , that my wife ! - Shut up . I 'm not gonna let an app decide who i love . Nobody meets anyone in person any more , darling . - I 'm not . No . - Why not ? - ( gasps softly ) - there you are , mommy . ( theme music playing )

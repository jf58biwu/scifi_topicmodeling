 Previously on " Agent Carter " ... The machine that Dr. Wilkes built is working . And we 've located Dottie . Don 't expect Peggy Carter to come and rescue you . I need you to discredit and subdue Agent Carter . Dig something up on her . Drop your weapons ! Peggy , is this supposed to be a rescue ? What did you tell her ? ! You knew this was a trap . Of course . But it wasn 't set for you . Jason . Ana . We can help each other control it . You can 't control it . You get what you need , sweetheart ? Not everything . You won 't get away with this . She won 't stop coming for you . Aah ! Ana ! " An orange glow would indicate " the nitramene has reached peak volatility and should be handled with caution . Cracking its shell would result in an implosion with a blast radius of ... " Oh . 500 yards . Delightful . There 's one last note here . " Avoid touching the core to the containment ring . Touching the core will result in ... " Death ? I was going to say " core overload , " but yes . Edwin , I 'm home ! Uh , I won 't be a moment , Ana ! Hello , darling . How was your life-drawing class ? Excellent . Next week , we begin nudes . - How very progressive . - Mm . Who was that on the telephone ? That was Mr. Stark 's newest associate . Is he going to help exonerate Mr. Stark ? - Who ? - The man on the phone . Woman , actually . Miss Peggy Carter . Oh . I don 't think she 's like the others . I think he respects her . Mm . Oh , where 's my head ? Benny Goodman is starting . You are trying to distract me . Nonsense . From what ? Worry . There 's nothing to be worried about . I promise you . Miss Carter won 't interfere with our lives in the least . Don 't make promises you can 't keep . Wasn 't sure how much cream ... The only thing I can get this ridiculous machine to tune into is Groucho Marx . I 'll try . We have a very precise schedule . And if I can just get Benny Goodman , then maybe she 'll ... Oh ! Sit . Look . She 's out of surgery . She has color in her cheeks . Miss Carter , they can 't even say if she 'll wake up . What Ana needs right now is for you to be beside her , listening to your voice , no one else 's . I 'm going to go home , pick up one of Howard 's radios , bring you a change of clothes , toothbrush , razor , so that when she does wake up , you will look like you . All right ? Good . You 're awake . By my timing , you 'll begin to lose mass in two minutes . You 're studying me ? I 'm studying us . Now tell me ... what happens when you vanish ? Do you travel to someplace else , or ... ? Tell me what you 've learned . You have me handcuffed , and you actually expect to compare notes ? Yes . Physicist to physicist . And then you 'll let me go ? Hand me some paper and a pen , and I 'll write down the formulas - I used to create my containment unit . - No , you 're killing time . Excuse me ? You think if you wait one minute , you 'll just fade through those handcuffs and escape , don 't you ? Or maybe you 're waiting for Peggy Carter to come and rescue you . - You want the truth ? - Yes . I 'm hoping I disappear and don 't come back . Oh , I don 't believe that . I don 't believe that for a moment , not after you 've worked so hard to stay in the realm of existence . And there is another option for you to consider , aside from your demise . We work together . Yes . Examining each other . We already know that if I get close to you , you draw zero matter from me and become solid , which you can 't control . I discovered that while you were unconscious . Don 't touch me ! Just answer me this one question . Do you hear it ? Hear what ? The voice ... As if it 's coming from your own thoughts , but it 's coming from someplace else . D-do you ... Do you hear it ? Or am I truly going crazy ? 10 seconds . Don 't worry . I promise you , this won 't hurt a bit . Thank God you 're all right . What happened ? Whitney Frost . She has Jason . Is he hurt ? Ana Jarvis . Oh , no . She ... She 's in hospital . I ... I don 't know . What did you get into ? Oh . Vernon Masters isn 't above ordering an old-fashioned beatdown . He 's looking for the uranium rods for Whitney Frost . Well , if she wants them so badly ... Let 's get them to her . You 're willing to give up the uranium rods for Jason ? I need Whitney to think I am . Question is , how do I reach her ? Maybe Joseph Manfredi . His soldiers were helping out at the Roxxon factory . But aren 't they just men for hire ? No , they 're more than that . Wait . Where you going ? I need to change . Well , really , I need a hot bath , but , um ... - Uh , neh ? - Oh , yeah . Um ... You were saying ? Joseph Manfredi , Whitney Frost ? Uh ... yeah . They were an item . Movie-star Whitney Frost and a mobster ? Remember the figueroa street slaughter ? Six criminals gunned down during a card game . Tabloids say that happened the same day Whitney dumped Manfredi for Calvin Chadwick . So he 's a maniac . He 's a man in love . Looks like we got company . We 're looking for some spaghetti . We only serve steak . - I have a message for your chef . - Sorry . We 're closed . Aw , nonna , you 're gonna love my gravy . I put a couple of cloves in there at the end , - spice it up real nice . - No , no , no , no . No , I 'm not ! No , I 'm just trying something different ! Oh , okay . What would you like ? You want me to throw it in the trash ? Is that what you want me to do ? Will that make you happy ? - Ah ! Ah ! - Of course not ! Of course not , ' cause nothing makes you happy , right ? - You can 't be happy ! - Unh ! Looks like we got two more for lunch . Hey ! Get out the road , you drunks ! Why won 't you tell me how you broke your hand ? M-maybe ' cause I did it taking down a high ... Level Russian operative . Yeah , all right , mate . Would I lie to you ? Oh , please ! You did it in a bar fight , just like every year in uni . Freshman year , broken nose , bar fight . Sophomore year , broken jaw , bar fight . Junior year , you broke ... Ah-yi ! Talk too much . Now I 'm empty . Well ... We 're at the right place , then . Uh , hey , shh , shh . Hey . Before I black out , all right , did your MI4 ... - Hmm ? - 5 ? Your MI-whatever ... did they ... Did they find that thing ? I 've ner had to break so many security protocols only to find a fully redacted file at the end of the rainbow . Oh . What you gonna do ? Jack , let 's not pretend . I know why you 're really here . Oh , yeah ? You want another shot at taking down my record of piccadilly commandos in an evening . Am I that see-through ? You don 't hurry , I 'm gonna get a head start . _ _ _ Whitney Frost was employing your muscle at a Roxxon facility we raided . Look , I wish I could help you , but how am I to know who my associates associate with ? Look at that . She likes you . She thinks you 're the devil . M-Mr . Manfredi , we know you have a relationship with Whitney Frost . Yeah , everybody in town knows that . Everybody also knows that she dumped me for a crooked politician . All we need you to do is get a message to her . All right , look what you 're doing . Okay , that 's it . Stop . Stop eating . You two have to go . - She 's got a weak heart . - She seems rather robust to me . You know little Tommy Fontana 's getting out next week ? Oh , yeah , sure , I know . I 'm in charge of baking him a welcome-home cake . Be a shame if Tommy found out you were the one who turned state 's evidence against him . That 's a lie . Tommy don 't know that . N-no ! No ! Nonna , nonna , no . Nonna ... Let go . Give us a moment , please . What message would you like me to deliver to Miss Frost ? What do you think of my research ? Think you 're a mass murderer of rats . My experiments , Dr. Wilkes ... Though rudimentary , they have produced results . I know how to control this , and I think you can , too . I-I-I don 't want to control this . I-I want it gone . See , that 's where your problem lies . You see this as a curse . I see it as a gift . - You think this is a gift ? - Yes ! To be at the whim of a force that 's trying to destroy me ? Only because you resist it . If you accept it , then you control it . Do you hear that ? You hear that , don 't you ? It 's there . Right now . And if you listen , it will guide you . Hello , gorgeous , I got something urgent . Wait . Close your eyes . Close your eyes , Dr. Wilkes . Shut out everything else and just embrace what you hear . What ? What is it ? First things first . Peggy Carter paid me a visit today . And what did you say ? Well , she did most of the talking . She wants her scientist back ... bad . I 'm not surprised . Well , she 's willing to give you the uranium rods in exchange for him ... unharmed . Tell Miss Carter she has a deal . I promise to wear the periwinkle tie you knitted for me . I promise to cook apple torte at least once a week . I promise not to bite the fork loudly when I eat . I promise we can get a Bernese mountain dog . I promise to like your brown cardigan . I promise to believe in the daily horoscope . I promise I will protect you ... to my dying day ... If you 'll please ... Please ... Wake up . Don 't make promises you can 't keep . You 're awake . My darling , you 're awake . I woke up at the Bernese mountain dog . But I wanted to see what else I could get . Mm . I 'm going to get you the physician . Oh . First ... Now doctor . Yes , she is awake and talking and beautiful and everything . Yes , yes , I will keep you updated . And , Miss Carter ... Thank you . Doctor , I want to thank you and your staff for everything that you 've done for us . Uh , when do you think we might be able to go home ? As you know , the surgery was very difficult . There was a great deal of internal damage . We almost lost her several times . Yes , but y-you said that the surgery was successful . And on the whole , it was . We saved her life . But there were some complications , some damage we couldn 't fully repair . I don 't know if you and your wife had ever planned on having children ... But that won 't be possible now . Does she know ? We have a nurse who can sit down with your wife and explain everything to her . Thank you , no . I 'll talk to her myself . What did he say ? He gave me the laundry list of prescriptions I need to get for you . We 're going to need shopping bags . Anything else ? No . No . You 're perfect . Are these volatile ? - No . - It certainly reads like uranium . - How did you do it ? - It 's pretty simple . I just painted some U-238 with a radium mixture . Good job , Aloysius . Really good work . Oh . See you learned my first name . Yeah , I did . What 's my middle name ? Samberly , what is with you ? We take you on missions , we treat you with respect ... Why are you always looking for things to be offended by ? Who knows anybody 's middle name ? It 's Herbert . Thanks . Dr. Samberly , you 'll be driving the truck . You will be providing cover . And you 'll handle the transaction . We need to get Dr. Wilkes' containment unit to the truck . You can take it apart and put it back together ? Uh , I hate that you even asked me that question . I will assume that 's a yes . All right , let 's get to it . To what ? What are you doing here ? Where 's Ana ? She 's still the hospital until she regains her strength . I came to get her cashmere throw . What are you doing ? We 're going to get Wilkes , then we 're going to get Whitney . How ? You don 't have to worry about it . You can go back to your wife knowing full well that I will make this right . How ? Mr. Jarvis , I understand that you have a great deal invested into the outcome of this mission . Indeed . Whitney Frost shot my wife . I 'm coming with you . No , you 're going back to the hospital . I want her to pay for what she did to us . And she will . Chief Sousa and I will make sure of it . And I will be there to see it . What 's that noise ? That 's Mr. Stark 's telex . Do you recognize this code ? That 's ... not code . These are design specifications . H-Howard Stark wants me to build a machine . You ? It says that ? Well , no , but you see someone else here who can ? What does the machine do ? I 'm not sure . A cannon . Something to do with gamma radiation . I believe it fires a pulse of high-energy photons . Which does what ? It could eliminate zero matter . Perhaps it could cure Jason Wilkes . Or kill Whitney Frost . Look , you already got me to admit I-I don 't know . Do you think you can build it ? Samberly , I swear to God , you 're on my last nerve right now . I can do it , but it 's complicated . I don 't know how long it 'll take . We need it done as quickly as possible . Then I should start now . Handoff is happening in less than an hour . It appears you need a new driver . Look at the three of you . Larry , Curly , could you give me a moment ? I need to have a word with Moe . Jack , I have neither the time nor the patience right now . You will . What is this ? You have something on me , right ? Now we 're even . But I promise , I won 't say a word . As long as you drop whatever it is that you 're doing and come with me back to New York ... To play by the rules . What are you prattling on about ? This covers your activities in June 1944 . I was in the war , same as you . If you want to compare war crimes , yours are a lot worse . Who put you up to this ? Was it Vernon Masters ? All you need to worry about is what 's in that file . And you never thought to question the convenience ? Vernon asked you to discredit me , and you locate the ideal report . Whatever this is , it 's a forgery . I 'm not falling for your slick talk . But you 're falling for his . You 're willing to believe any phlegm Vernon coughs up onto the paper because you 're worried that I would betray your trust . I wouldn 't . This is your choice , not mine . Chief Thompson , you don 't need to cut corners to get ahead . You 're better than that . Hello , gorgeous . Don 't call me that . Oh , yeah ? Why 's that ? I know what I look like . Yeah . You 're more beautiful today than the day I met you . You are a terrible liar , Joe . Hey , I 'm not lying ! That mark on your face is nothing to be ashamed of . It 's power . And that 's what makes you so beautiful . And you should never have to hide it ... From the rest of the world . There 's my girl . Rain check . They 're here . Bring him out ! Agent Carter . Jason , you 're solid . - How ? - Peggy , don 't do this , please . Mnh-mnh . You 've seen your goods . Now let me see mine . Ah , such a pity , that two accomplished women should be standing on opposite sides . Yes , you 're such a staunch defender of the sisterhood . I can tell by the way you shot an unarmed , innocent woman . Well , occasionally , sacrifices must be made . 35,000 CPMs . They pass muster . Eh . Hand over Dr. Wilkes . Less than a minute to go before you have to crawl back in your cage like an animal . Don 't worry . - They 're fake . - Move ! Move ! - Those are fake . Stop them ! - Go ! Stop them ! Move ! Stop them ! They 're following us . I see them . You 're all right . We 'll lose them , and you 'll be safe . She 's never going to stop . Till she gets those rods , she 's gonna keep coming for us . We 'll beat her . How ? Howard sent specifications for a machine . What kind of machine ? A gamma cannon . Gamma rays ? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are ? We have to destroy those rods now . The rods are safe . She won 't find them . Are they gaining on us ? No , they 're still at quite a distance . Why are they being so slow ? They 're in a big-block caddie . They should 've lapped us by now . - What are you doing ? - Jason , what 's happening ? - Where are the rods ? - Put it down , Wilkes . Jason , I don 't understand . You are outside of your containment chamber . Miss Frost taught me a few things about my condition . Turns out she 's as brilliant as we thought . This isn 't you talking . You 've been affected by the zero matter . Where are the rods , Peggy ? What , so you can give them to Frost ? Forget about it . I 'm not going backwards . Where ... Lower your gun , and we will figure this out together . No . Tell me where they ... I won 't . You 'll have to kill me . Okay , okay ... Sousa , tell me . Jason , stop this . I know how you feel about her . You want her to die for this ? Daniel , don 't listen to him . If I have to choose between her life or mine , I know what I 'm choosing . Don 't tell him , Daniel . Listen to me . Tell me or you will never see her breathe again ! - The SSR . - Daniel , stop ! - Where ? ! - No ! Wall safe at the SSR lab . I 'm sorry . Stop the truck ! Oh . Great work , Jack . Above and beyond . Thanks . Got to tell you ... Starting to question the validity of that file . I mean , it 's just ... It 's a little too good to be true . Jack ... What 's happened and what 's true are two different things . Now , this is an official document . That means it 's true , regardless of what happened . Do I really need to be telling you this ? No . Sir , I understand that . Still ... My gut is telling me that Peggy Carter ... Sir , woman on Line One said it 's urgent . - Yeah . - She knew your access code . Vernon Masters . Jack , could you give me a minute ? And , uh , close the door on your way out . Well , then I 'll retrieve them at once . Spoken like someone pretending he had a choice . I 'll need you to bring them directly to me . Vernon . Jack . Now 's not a good time . Wait for me in my office , will you ? I won 't let you do this . Jack , I owe you a sincere apology . I underestimated you . - You 're right to call me on it . - Can 't let you take them , Vernon . Looks like you 're gonna be getting that promotion a li ... Okay , stop ! Right there . Well ... You have no idea how sorry I am to hear that . Jack ? What are you doing here ? I don 't know . Why are you in the lab ? Uh ... I 'm not sure . I was in the bullpen . Now I 'm here . Oh , damn it . Look . Chief Thompson , someone used this device to give you amnesia . Do you have any memory of who ? Excuse me ? The uranium is gone . Jack , this is of the utmost importance . What is the last thing that you remember ? I was on the phone . Who were you talking to ? I wasn 't talking . I was listening . To Vernon and a woman . Is this your handwriting ? Yeah . Those are coordinates . To Whitney Frost . Let 's hurry up . Or do you need me to load your weapons , too ? Why don 't you stay here in case we 're wrong and Vernon returns ? Don 't you trust me , Danny boy ? I 'm hurt . You don 't have the best track record . Your backup is a lab tech and a butler . If I were you , I 'd take all the help I could get . Two hours ago , you were using a redacted file to frame me . And 20 minutes ago , I was having my brain zapped . If I were helping them , I 'd be on my way there . But I 'm here with you . Let 's go . Let 's do it . I think he 's being honest . Agreed . In the name of honesty , I need to make sure we 're squared away about the mission here . Wilkes is no longer a hostage . He 's a hostile . He 's infected with zero matter . He 's confused . No . He 's desperate . You don 't know him , Daniel . But I ... But I know desperation . You know what I 'd give to be able to walk again ? A lot . We need to be dispassionate about this . Meaning what ? I know you and Wilkes are close . Are you ... suggesting that my personal feelings might interfere with the mission ? I 'm just saying ... We might have to make some hard choices , okay ? Well , that 's wonderful advice , Chief Sousa , and I hope you yourself abide by it . What does that mean ? You are the reason why Whitney Frost is in possession of enough uranium to destroy the city . Excuse ... He was gonna shoot you . - Yes , he was . - And I was supposed to just let it happen ? " Dispassionate , " Chief . Your word . So if the situation was reversed , that 's what you would 've done ? Let him shoot me ? If it makes a difference ... I 'd have let him blow you both away . Let 's go ! So , you think Howard Stark 's gamma cannon will work ? Well , thanks to some fixes I made , yes . - It will work . - Will it kill Whitney ? Which ... answer would you find more attractive ? So you don 't know . Look , just because I saved the day by building this invention doesn 't mean this mission won 't be dangerous . I might not return . You 'll be fine . - Might I have a word ? - Way to kill the moment . What do you want now ? W-with her , actually . Mr. Jarvis , I 'm ... I-I heard about your wife . I 'm so s ... Miss Roberts , I don 't know how long this foray will take . Would you look after Ana while I 'm gone ? Y-yes . With pleasure . Just a few of her favorite recipes . Oh . Oh , okay . - Cashmere blanket for cold nights . - Okay . Her favorite mug , from our wedding anniversary . I 'm sorry . I may have misunderstood . - How long do you think ... - And this . If necessary . Oh , my . Oh . I promise . I will keep her safe . Thank you . Let 's move . Jack estimates they have a 90-minute lead on us . Copy . Mr. Jarvis , are you all right ? I 'm fine . Are we ready ? Ready . I 've always loved fireworks . Well , just fire , really . What if this doesn 't work ? The rift will open . Zero matter will pour out , and you and I will absorb it . But what if that 's not what happens ? I held a gun on a woman who only wanted to help . I-if this doesn 't work , I 've thrown everything away for nothing . Dr. Wilkes , it will work . You know this will work the same way that I do . Because the whisper in your head says it will . Hit it ! Good lord . We 're too late . Oh , it 's beautiful . You hear it , too . What do you hear ? A voice . No . No , I don 't hear anything . Jason . No . Jason , what are you doing ? What are you ... No ! What about me ? ! Take me ! No ! It 's supposed to be me ! No ! What about me ? ! Take me ! Do you think that gamma pulse can reach that far ? I suppose . " Suppose " or " yes " ? Yes . Maybe . Who is this guy ? - And if it hits the rift ? - Great . Will it close the rift ? Yes . Maybe . I don 't know . Did you hire him ? Unfortunately . You 're asking me to judge what will happen when something I 've never fired miraculously manages to hit something I never knew existed ? I guess this is where we find out . What about Miss Frost ? She 'll have to wait . We will get her . But first , we need to close the rift before any zero matter gets out . He doesn 't even know if Mr. Stark 's gamma cannon will work . It 's my cannon . You should know you only get one shot . At what ? At all . I had just enough time to manufacture one battery charge . Whitney Frost will get away . We need to close the rift . Mr. Jarvis , stop ! Would you just shoot the thing , for God 's sake ? And I 'll try and prevent him from killing himself . Chief . Chief , what do we do ? - Do as Peggy says ! - Do as Peggy says ! Edwin Jarvis , stop what you 're doing ! Mr. Jarvis ! Jarvis ! Mr. Jarvis , pick up the radio this ... One degree up . Are you accounting for the easterly breeze ? Three degrees right . You can 't just fire it straight . The pulse tends to travel on a parabolic arc . Okay , I got it , Samberly , thank you . I didn 't know your unit was in artillery . It wasn 't . Another degree up . Set . Load it . Safety first , boys ! Drive her home , Chief . Can 't make any promises . Dr. Wilkes ? Dr. Wilkes . Dr. Wilkes . Dr. Wilkes , can you hear me ? Jason ? Edwin ? Hi . A-apple torte ? I-I hear it 's your favorite . Where 's Mr. Jarvis ? Who are you ? I 'm Rose . I work with Peg . Mr. Jarvis said he 'll be back shortly and that I should keep you company until he gets back . I understand that you like to play hangman . You guess first . Five letters . E. E 's a good choice . P. Nope . S. Mm ... M ? Jason ! Whitney Frost ! Something happened to him . He went inside ... No ! What did you do ? ! I stopped her . He 's breathing . A problem . So is she . Run . Now . You 're gonna pay for that . Plug them ! Wait ! Wait . Wait . He has what I want . And the key to controlling him is to control those that he loves . Keep them alive .

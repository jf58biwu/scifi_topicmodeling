 Previously on " the 100 " ... Thelonious is gone . He took 12 people , 12 guns . We 're going to the city of light . Take this leap of faith with me , john murphy , And let me show you there is so much more for you ... Than this . Quint : Biggest army we 've ever had Waits for us to give it a mission . We will , after bellamy turns off the acid fog . If this is an alliance Between the outsiders and the ark , We shouldn 't take this threat lightly . There 's a war council meeting happening tonight And all the leaders are gonna be there . We 're gonna use a missile . We have to start evacuating . If we evacuate , they 'll know We have a spy inside their walls . We slip away . Right now . Fire . You knew and you let this happen ? Some of them aren 't wearing hazmat suits . Means they 're cured . Marrow treatments work . We started taking them from the dorm , one at a time . They 're not taking anyone else out of this room without a fight . Yaah ! Uhh ! Man : Find them . We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with cage . Come with me . You 're safe now . Richards : It 'd sure be nice to have some sign That we 're not just marching to our own deaths . We 're not . Harris : Hey , tell me if you know this one . Murphy : Not again , please . Harris : A grounder and a reaper walk into a bar . The bartender looks to the grounder , he says , " we don 't serve your kind around here . " The reaper gets up and leaves . [ chuckles ] You get it ? Reapers eat grounders . I will take jaha 's staff And beat you to death with it . John . Or this one . Uh , an arker , a grounder , And a mountain man walk into a bar . Arker says , " i 'll take some moonshine . " Grounder says , " i 'll take some , too . " The mountain man , he says- - [ click ] Aah ! [ click ] No one move ! We 're in the middle of a minefield . Anybody else want a sign ? Cage : It 's about time , lieutenant . Emerson : Yes , sir . Brief me on the 44 . I have soldiers Going from room to room . It 's only a matter of time . So , you have nothing . Yes , sir . Those kids are the key To everything , lieutenant . And 44 people don 't just vanish Inside of a sealed bunker . They could if they had enough help . My father . It 's unclear , sir . But he 's not the only one With moral reservations about What we 've done to survive . What they don 't realize is that Those kids are dangerous . They irradiated an entire level . I agree , sir . And now that level 5 has been decontaminated , We can tell the truth about that . Those kids killed 10 of our soldiers . We can use that to flush them out . Do it . Yes , sir . Now let 's talk about the outside threat . Look at that . Her entire army stopped just outside the veil 's range . Why ? They 're learning , sir . I told you This commander was different . What 's she gonna do ? Wait us out ? We 've been safe down here for 97 years . She 's gonna lose patience , and when she does , Deploy the fog . [ indistinct shouting ] Clarke : What if we 're wrong And cutting the power doesn 't Disengage the locks ? Your people said it will . You should rest , clarke . We could blow the doors manually . Plans don 't last very long in battle . Tiring yourself with questions already asked and answered Is a waste of energy . People died for this , lexa . It has to work . You 're doing what i did when i first took command . We can 't move forward and it 's giving you Too much time to think . Once bellamy shuts down the acid fog And the battle begins , Everything will be clear . What if he can 't ? What if it was too dangerous And i sent him in there anyway ? You care about him . I care about all of them . Yet you worry about him more . I couldn 't have kept us alive all this time without him . We need him . And now i might be the one who gets him killed . That 's what it means to be a leader , clarke . The truth is , we must look into The eyes of our warriors and say , " go die for me . " If only it were that easy . Can we please just get back to the plan ? No . You could be a leader your people look to . Pour their hopes and dreams into . Someone they will fight and die for . I never asked for that . I 'm just trying to keep us alive . You were born for this , clarke . Same as me . [ beeping ] [ beeping ] raven on radio : Bellamy . Come in . Yeah , i 'm a little busy here , raven . Raven : You missed check-in . Did you find the source of the acid fog yet ? I 'm making my way there now . It 's taking longer than i thought . I don 't know enough to crack it on this end . You gotta give me something . I 'm working on it . [ beeping ] Something 's wrong . Raven : What ? My key card isn 't working . That 's not good . I need to find another way in . I 'll call you back . Stay right there ! Hands in the air . Eastbound . In pursuit of the target . He 's not lovejoy . Repeat , he 's not lovejoy . Man : Split up . Garza : Checking in . We 're heading down to the base level . Garza : You 're surrounded ! There 's no way out ! Man on radio : Keep your eyes open . Garza , do you see him ? Uhh ! Uhh ! Man on radio : Garza , what 's your status ? Man : Garza . Man : Garza . Do you see him ? [ man on radio speaking indistinctly ] [ beeping ] I 've been summoned ? Really ? Yeah . Thanks . I need your help on this acid fog deal . Bellamy will radio again when he gets Eyes on the dispersal system , But i want to talk it through first . I think- - what 's funny ? Oh , come on . It 's a banner day . You gotta see that . Raven reyes asking for help ? It 's one for the history books . Never mind . I 'll do it on my own . Hey . Joke . Humor . It 's just what i do . There are a thousand grounders camped in the woods Waiting to go get my friends , And they can 't move because- - Because i can 't figure this out . Hey . No one could . It 's a tough ask , not without more data . Ok . So , they make fog that melts people . What are we talking ? Nucleation ? Oh , please tell me it 's brownian diffusion . I 'll have you know I was a god at fluid dynamics . You think you were a god at everything . Empirical evidence doesn 't lie . All right . Let 's get our stoichiometry on . [ indistinct chatter ] Everything ok ? I 'm going over it and over it in my head , Just trying to figure out how You 're still alive . What are you talking about ? I saw you in tondc before the missile hit . I know you , clarke . Something 's wrong . And then you and lexa disappear And just happen to survive . Tell me you didn 't know it was coming . Octavia ... You let all those people die . You were gonna let me die . I did it to save bellamy , So that we could win this war . Don 't you see that ? If we 'd evacuated tondc , Mount weather would 've known that Someone tipped us off . They would have found your brother . No . Bellamy would have never Told you to do that . He would 've found another way . I couldn 't take that risk . Right . Because you 're in charge now , And you decide who is disposable . You 'd have fit right in on the council . Hey . Octavia . What ? You can 't tell anyone . If people found out- - The alliance will break . I 'm not an idiot , clarke . Commander . Octavia . It is time for the southernmost guard post 's rotation . You should relieve them . Indra expects me to be on a scouting mission with lincoln . Now you 're needed at the guard post . Indra will join you there shortly . She won 't say anything . You can 't be sure of that . Too many people know , clarke . You worry about your people , i 'll worry about mine . [ knocking ] Vincent , i need your help . It 's all over the radio . They know about you . Did anyone see you come here ? No . Been keeping to the vents And unmonitored halls , like you said . Man : Vincent . It 's ok . Lee 's one of us . Dante was like a father to me . Some of us don 't agree with cage 's agenda . Where 's jasper , monty , and maya ? They 're ok . Thanks to lee , we moved them To a wing that 's already been searched . Isn 't that a risk ? We had no choice . They 've gone public with what happened on level 5 . They 're saying you killed 10 soldiers . I don 't know how much longer we can Keep this shell game going . Did you take out the acid fog yet ? No . No . That 's why i 'm here . I 'm gonna need another route . Way ahead of you . You can get there Through the retrofit zones . They 're off limits . No cameras , no patrols . We use some to move the kids . And that 's your other route . You 're also gonna need this . An acetylene torch . Go to the northwest corridor . [ indistinct chatter ] Indra . Aren 't you supposed to be on watch ? I don 't stand post . Well , um , where 's octavia ? With lincoln . Scouting the mountain . Clarke : Don 't move . I have my orders . I don 't care . This is not happening . Let 's go . Man : It 's clearing . Murphy : There . We have the light and , oh , look . Footprints are gone . Sand . It blows . Do you see that ? Richards : The city of light . Emori was telling the truth . We are so close . You wanted a sign ? There it is . We have to push forward . Murphy : What about the mines ? We were meant to be here , john . These mines , they 're just another test of our faith . Yeah , well , i was always crap at tests , so ... Please . After you , chancellor . Uhh ! Clarke : You sent him to kill octavia ? I told you she 's not a problem . Leave us . No . I 'm not letting him out of my sight . Stand down for now and wait for my command . What the hell is wrong with you ? You can 't just kill everyone you don 't trust . Yes , i can . Well , i won 't let you . You were willing to let her die two days ago . Nothing has changed . You 're wrong . I have . I can 't do this anymore . Lexa : Octavia is a threat . If you weren 't so close to her , you 'd see that . It 's because i 'm close to her That i know she 's loyal . Her brother is more important to her than anyone . She would never endanger his life . And you 're willing to risk everything on that ? On your feelings ? Yes . You say having feelings makes me weak . But you 're weak for hiding from them . I might be a hypocrite , lexa , but you 're a liar . You felt something for gustus . You 're still haunted by costia . You want everyone to think You 're above it all , But i see right through you . Get out . 250 people died in that village . I know you felt for them . But you let them burn . Not everyone . Not you . Well , if you care about me , then--trust me . Octavia 's not a threat . I can 't do that . I can 't sacrifice my people anymore . If you do anything to hurt octavia , I 'll tell everyone we knew about the missile . Man : There 's no trap . No trap . It 's 4 mines down , infinity to go , jaha . We will make it , john . Richards : I can 't do this anymore . Murphy : Calm down , richards . Murphy : What do you think it is , anyway ? It must have power . A shower would be nice right about now . Wash off the rest of harris . [ groaning ] Sienna said it 's a place Where everyone is welcome . That 'd be a first , wouldn 't it ? I can 't take this . It 's right there ! Hey ! Richards , stop ! Man : Uhh ! [ hissing ] Hydrochloric acid . Sulfuric acid . Um ... Perchloric acid . Now you 're just naming all the acids you know . Well , temperature would be an issue . Hey , it could be nitric acid . Nothing exploded . Fine . Ruin my fun . This isn 't helping . Like i said , we should just Disable the machine itself . Any machine like this has to have safeguards . They can 't keep a boatload of acid around Without any way to neutralize it . It 's basic safety protocol . Let 's use that . Neutralization is too complicated . Please . It 's a bag of limestone in the corner . Here you go again- - big ideas with no follow-through . I 'll have you know i have great follow-through . [ glass shatters ] [ electricity crackles ] Bellamy on radio : Come in , raven . I made it . I hope you have a plan . Still working on it . Give us something to go on . What do you see ? A huge steel vat . Looks like a submarine . Some other tanks with chemical formulas And warning labels . Bunch of pipes running into the wall . Monitor . Ooh , go to the monitor . Hello to you , too . Don 't mind wick . He 's not really helping . Hey , bellamy . How 's my boy monty doing ? Fine . But i don 't know for how long . Great . Pleasantries over . Listen , if that monitor is a control panel , We can use it to kill this thing . Look for a ph scale . Right . It has a scale , but the rest ... S-3 , v-2-0-5 , H-2-s-2-o-7 . Can 't i just blow this thing ? - No . - No , they 'll know their defenses are down . They 'll send a tech to fix it or reroute it Or pull out some other weapon we don 't even know about . Plus , you 'd probably melt your face off . [ sigh ] Look , you know i like a good explosion , But we gotta think our way through this one . We can do this . Raven : Here we go . Jaha : Another test passed . We made it . Come on . Are you kidding me ? Are you kidding me ? This is it ? Murphy : This is what we crossed a desert to find ? It can 't be . Well , guess what ? Your enlightened society ? It 's not a city . It 's nothing . I flew down from space . I defied death . It was all for a reason . It has to be . Ok , uh ... Level indicator . Nope . Do you see an actuator anywhere ? One must be controlling the valves . I have no idea what that is . Norms . Come on , what else ? Internal pressure sensor . No . Uh , setpoint and alarm . Let 's avoid that one . Maintenance and cleaning . Wait . Corrosion . The protective oxide film would Have to be restored in tanks this old . They 'd need to be cleaned . And neutralized . Bellamy , go to that subdirectory . See if there 's anything there that says " passivation . " [ beep ] ok . I 'm on it . [ beep ] Got it . [ beep ] Says , uh , " aqueous sodium hydroxide bath . " That 's a base . That 'll neutralize the acid . Select that . [ beep ] It 's doing something . Raven : You should be able to hear the pump . Bellamy : I can hear them . Needle 's moving . Bellamy : Ph is rising . It 's working . [ beeping ] Passivation success . Both : Yes ! [ raven laughs ] Bellamy : All right . Send a flare . Roger that . You sent for me ? Yes . Octavia has nothing to fear from me . I do trust you , clarke . I know how hard that is for you . You think our ways are harsh , But that 's how we survive . Maybe life should be about More than just surviving . Don 't we deserve better than that ? Maybe we do . I 'm sorry . I- - I 'm not ready . To be with anyone . Not yet . Bellamy did it . You were right to have faith in him . Now we fight . [ blowing horns ] [ crowd cheering ] [ crowd cheering ] When i said , " let 's get our stoichiometry on , " not what i meant . Ah . Um , it 's probably a bad idea . We 're going to war . Stop talking . [ clattering ] I 'm just saying , the brace i made Would 've been easier to take off . That brace was tragic . What did i say about talking , wick ? I think you can call me kyle . [ chuckles ] [ rustling , indistinct chatter ] Raven , we 've got a problem . Bellamy on radio : Dammit , where are you ? I don 't think the acid fog is down . Get word to clarke . We have to stop the army . Raven ! Confirmed , sir . Intruder 's radio has been cut off . Bellamy : Raven , what 's going on ? Reset the panel . The army 's almost in range . [ beeping ] Oh . Good job finding the radio , lieutenant . Do a sweep and make sure they have no more . Yes , sir . And bring me the intruder . [ banging ] Drop your weapon ! [ alarm blaring ] Garza : On my lead . He 's armed . Don 't be a hero . Show yourself . Hands first . Cease fire ! Don 't hit the tanks . [ indistinct chatter ] The veil is ready on your command , sir . Wait until they 're all inside at the kill box . 10 more seconds . Emerson : Roger that . Deploying in 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... [ clicking ] 7 ... He 's out . Man : You go after him . We 'll check the tanks . Emerson : 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . [ beep ] We 're go for veil . [ screaming ] [ coughing ] [ beeping ] Well ? We are negative on veil deployment . What happened ? Soldiers report an explosion in chemicals deployment . Multiple casualties . The veil is down . I repeat , the veil is down . What else can we use ? The reapers can 't take a force this large . [ slaps table ] don 't tell me what we can 't do . Tell me what else we have . Nothing . All we have is the doors . Hey . We have to meet the strike team . You kind of , ahem , shut down on me there . What 's up ? What ? Nothing . [ sigh ] right . This was too much . Look ... If you want to do this , i 'm in . But i 'm not gonna play games . So , figure it out . We have a war to win . [ rustling , indistinct chatter ] Hey . What do you want ? I 'm changing your mission . You 're not going to the mines with indra . I 'm placing you in the rear guard , Where you 'll be safe . Like hell you are . I don 't take orders from you . I take orders from indra . I 'm trying to protect you , octavia . Protect me . One day , hopefully , you 'll understand what i did . Never . I 'll fight this war with you now Because i want our friends back . But after that , we 're done . The commander 's looking for you . What was that about ? Clarke 's trying to reassign me to the rear guard . You 're a warrior . You 'll be in the mines with me . I know what bothers you . They know about the missile . How could you not hate them ? Indra , they almost killed you . They didn 't do anything . The enemy did . Lexa 's a great commander because she 's ruthless . That 's why we 'll win this battle . That 's wrong . That 's war . - Yaaah ! - [ all shouting indistinctly ] Yaaah ! What a joke . Jaha : It doesn 't make any sense . The rest of the world is broken , But these panels are intact . Well , we can fix that . Jaha : John . [ clank ] What the hell is that ? It 's a drone . Jaha : Don 't lose sight of it . Where 's it going ? I don 't know ... But we 're gonna follow it . In this . Tell me , what level of crazy is too much for you ? I 'm just curious . We need a boat ... And a boat appears . This is our destiny . The city of light is out there And we are gonna find it . Now , get in the boat . You heard the man .

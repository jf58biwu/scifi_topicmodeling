 The us government is planning to attack the Soviet union . We have to prevent innocent people from getting hurt . The Americans , all new Tuesdays at 10 : 00 on fx . Fx presents legion . Where are you right now ? Your head 's off somewhere . David . Where are you right now ? Where are you right now ? Hi . Hi . Don 't talk . Don 't talk . It 's okay , we 're here . You 've had a good burn . But we 're gonna get you sorted out . Careful , careful , careful . It 's good . It 's good . I 'm thinking of growing half a mustache . Maybe half a beard . Or ... what 's the look where it 's just a beard and no mustache ? Darling , hush . There 's my handsome guy . - Mirror . - Maybe wait until the swelling goes down . Give me the god damn mirror . Hey , are you good ? Okay , good . - Who are you people ? - I ask the questions . The girl . Where is the girl ? I think you 're about to find out . Code black ! Do it , now ! Bureau 19 has recommended desk duty . Perfect . Except , you know , in the field . - What ? - I said , that 's great . Desk duty . Perfect . I 'll bring the desk with me . That was my feeling . Small desk , obviously . Maybe it folds up . But that way I 'll have it while I 'm making the world safe for democracy some more . - Specialists don 't ... - Yeah , okay . Here 's the deal . I have burns over 40 % of my body and I spent six weeks with a tube jammed into the head of my dick while my husband cried himself to sleep every night . We were ambushed at the pool . Men died . And I am going to finish what I started . So if you want me behind a desk , you better find a portable one . Because the second I walk out of this room , I 'm going to war . David . Hello . Well , love that headband . I know . Me ? Not so good . Third degree , thank you very much . Very painful . We have so much to talk about . Yeah , you can kill the others . No . Put it away . You 're right . We need to talk . Shit . Team a 's been compromised . - Team b ? - Ready at the go point . Wait . Personal feelings ? Intelligence gathering . Let 's see what happens next . So you 're just gonna whip up some kind of peace accord , what , before lunch or by dinner ? Babe . I don 't care if you save me or the world ... If you don 't save yourself . You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia ? - You 're not ... - The most dangerous thing is believing you don 't have it . That 's the trick . The mind killer . Your disease convinces you , you don 't have it . So , for example , one day in the hospital , you meet a girl and she has some friends and they tell you you 're not sick . You have super powers . And more than anything , you wanna believe it because that means you 're not crazy . It means you can fall in love and live happily ever after . But you know if you believe it ... if you surrender to the hope and you 're wrong , then ... You 're never coming back . I 'm here . I 'm real . The power is real . You gotta accept it . Otherwise , we can 't move on . I was in clockworks for six years . Drugged , doing nothing . Contributing nothing . And now , finally , I can be useful . I can help . Don 't you get it ? I am so sick of myself . This only works if it 's not about me . David . And Roger . Come on , just let ... Face-to-face . Please . No . Well , if you 've got a better idea ... yeah . Kill him . - Kill them all . - Grow up . We can 't just murder people . Or is that who we are now ? That 's who they are . So if you don 't want to be dead ... - Do you have to ? - Yes . I absolutely have to . If this thing fails , well ... You didn 't see all of Walter 's blood pouring out of his eyes . All right . We move , then . Assume d3 knows our position . Execute plan m . Just let me talk to him . We have a ... - Rapport . - He tried to kill you . - Twice . - To be fair , the second time , he was just gonna kill you . And anyway , with that kind of thinking ... - David . - No . With that kind of thinking , wars would never end . David , read his mind . You have the power . You can control it now . We may never get this chance again . To know what d3 knows . Their operations , their spies , their tactics . Read his mind . So use him , you 're saying . And then what ? Kill him ? - 100 % . Hi ... look , whatever we do , we need to get this parasite out of David 's head . And fast . The ... the halo is losing power . Hey , kid ! And when it fails ? Think of the shadow king as a computer virus . It 's been in David 's head for decades . Learning his systems , bypassing his defenses . Now it 's ready to override the original program . Meaning me . Exactly . Meaning you . If we don 't get amahl farouk out of your head today , he will erase you . Permanently . It 's sweet . They think they can save you . I thought you might be thirsty . On the table . - Do you have a second to ... - Don 't talk to me . Right , sorry . Just ... you should , um ... We should ... Recharge . I 'm good . - You two have a fight ? - Shut up . She just ... we ... She thinks I left her when we were in the astral plane . And I ... I 've tried to explain that it wasn 't my ... you need to leave . He seems nice . Have I seen you before ? No , don 't tell me . I 'll remember . Oliver , could we talk ? What 's happening , space captain ? W-would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? Well , I 'm on a mostly liquid diet . I like liquid . You know , you remind me of someone . Your wife ? No , that 's not it . More ... No . Well , we can figure it out over dinner . Assuming we 're not all dead by then . Watch it , it 's vibrating . Oliver , there 's vibration . Whoops , that 's me . I should ... Ta for now . I 'm sorry . Well , if you 're not now , you will be . Can we move past the threats ? I don 't think you understand . There 's 50 of you . We 're a tactical arm of the United States military , working in conjunction with government agencies all over the world . And dinosaurs once ruled the earth . And remind me what happened to them . Are you threatening the entire human race ? Is that ... do I have that right ? What 's your name , son ? - Clark . - Well , Clark , I 'm Melanie . I know . Melanie bird . Wife of Oliver Anthony bird . Missing for 20 years and presumed dead . He 'll turn up . They know where I am , division three . They 'll come looking when we don 't check in . I 'm thinking 20 minutes . And when they do , they 'll bring an army . Here 's the thing , Clark : You caught me on a good day , so I 'm gonna be honest with you . You were right . About David . He 's a world-breaker . And if you 'd killed him before he figured that out , then maybe your tactical forces and ... what is it ? World coalition ? Maybe that would 've impressed me . But not now . Well , kid ... You better learn to fly like a bird , because the age of the dinosaur is over . - Is this ... - It just doesn 't , for some reason ... Is this real ? - Feel real . - A simulation . - Are you real ? - No , this is real . What is the the point of life ? - I don 't have ... - Pretty sure . - An illness . - What 's the old . Maverick saying ? Trying to what ? - ' Cause I 'm sick . - Be happy ? - You 're not ... - Fulfilled . Schizophrenic . War is over . If you want it . I 'm boosting the power , but it ... it won 't last long . You don 't look so good . I 'm fine . No , something 's going on here . Well , this has been great , but I think I hear my ride . Does anybody see a warbird helicopter ? You don 't have to be afraid . - I 'm not . - You don 't have to be afraid . You don 't have to be afraid . I 'm not . You ... Don 't ... Have ... To ... Be ... Afraid . - Stop saying that . - Why don 't you just leave us alone ? - Yeah , to do what ? - I don 't know . Fall in love , have babies . Well , see , now , that 's a problem . 'Cause your babies and my babies , who wins that sandbox squabble ? You don 't have to be ... I know , I don 't have to be afraid , but I am because look at you . All of you . You 're gods . And someday , you 're gonna wake up and realize you don 't need to listen to us anymore . Well isn 't that the history of the world ? People of different nations , different languages , learning to live together . David ? Hey , sexy . You can 't be here . Why not ? 'Cause David put a hat on ? Look , front door closes , I go in the back . You like that , don 't you ? A little backdoor action . You 're gonna help me . No . I 'm really not . We 're connected , kid . You , David , me . It 's your fault . When you were in his head , I was in yours . And I may not be on his frequency right now , but you can hear me just fine , can 't you ? Stop . My mother died a few years back . Cancer . She tried all the things . Chemo , radiation , surgery . You know what they do with a tumor when they cut it out ? They put it in a bag and burn it . Am I the tumor in this ? Your Lenny mask is running . I 've got other faces . Stop it . You 're gonna help me escape . You want me out of David ? Fine , I 'm gone . But you have to help me get away . Why would I do that ? Because if you don 't , I 'll kill him . Not if we kill you first . You ever make soup ? Cut up the meat , vegetables , add broth , cook it for a couple hours . You ever try to unmake soup ? I 'm part of him . And the only way you 're gonna get me out without killing him is if I decide to leave on my own . There it is . Now you see . - How would I ... - You 're smart , for a lady . You 'll figure it out . Look , even if I wanted to , I 'm not even in the top three tiers of ... We 're talking about three branches of government . I just need a meeting , face-to-face . Why ? So you can melt their heads ? All right , this meeting is over . No , I need a meeting so that I can change their mind ... we need to get him to the lab . So what 's going on ? Is he sick ? Nothing . Ptonomy , get him to holding . He 's not sick . He has some kind of creature in his head . A mutant . Very old . - Syd ! - No . David 's right . Trust . This thing attached itself to him when he was a kid . Like a parasite . It 's trying to erase him . But we 're gonna get it out . Maybe I 'm wrong , but I think you like David . I think you feel something for him . So I 'm gonna give you a chance here . You wanna help ? That 's nice . Take him to the cell . I can 't risk it . Try anything and I snap your neck . What happened to trust ? General ? Major Briggs wants permission - to launch the peacemaker . - No . Tell him to move one click closer then hold . I 'm giving your man another hour . What happened ? Doesn 't matter , we 'll probably all be dead in ten minutes . Why am I tied down ? You tell me . God , I can feel him inside , trying to force his way out . Use your power . You just have to hold on for a little while longer . God . And then what ? Then ... When we pull , you push . What ... and boom goes the dynamite . I 'll be you know where . Okay , kill it now . Wait . How does it work ? We 've identified a second set of brain waves inside David 's head . Now , this device targets everything that isn 't David . It creates a vortex ... A kind of a magnetic field ... Which sucks out hopefully every last trace of farouk . And leaves David intact . How will I know ... gonna render his access . 2.9 % and rising . Correct . It 's working . The only way you 're gonna get me out without killing him is if I decide to leave on my own . Hold on , it ... It 's fighting back . No . Lenny . Whoa . I was just wondering ... What am I without you ? You know , we 've been together for so long . Sun and moon . You know , people lose a limb and ... In the night ... years go by ... And still , they reach for it . The ... the phantom . Are you my phantom ? What happens to me when you 're gone ? I 'm ... Not ... Leaving ! No . Stop it . We have to . - Sit . - Get out of my way . Oliver , I need more power . Stay here . Hey , you see that , right ? Send the equinox . Oliver , now ! David ? Hold on ! Click , click . Bang . Melanie . Electric grid , I think . Mismatched wires and all that . You might wanna form a bucket chain . Hey , it 's okay . You 're okay . He 's gone . Here . Remember how you told me not to be afraid ? All right , that was a mistake . We 're gonna need to work together now , though . I know . I 'll talk to them . Ms. bird ! Ms. bird . - Is it ... - Yeah . It 's gone .. Hey . - Are you okay ? - I 'm ... I think you ruptured my spleen . - Hi . - Hey . Did we win ? Does it look like we won ? You should not have done that , as much as I like kissing you . Woulda killed you . How do you feel ? Better . I ... i don 't understand . It needs a host , the shadow king . So if it 's not in one of us ... where 's Oliver ? Where should we look first ? Someplace warm . So . They 're headed south . What is that ? Is that one of Cary 's ? I think it likes you . What the ... No ! It 's gonna take an hour at this time . Wow , look at Stan 's yard . Someone 's been busy . Clearly not in ours . Maybe Henry can do some work today . Yeah . I forget your back is always bad this time of year . Only when there are leaves ... When did you wash this last ? The Americans .

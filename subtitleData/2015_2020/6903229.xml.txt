 Man : The us government is planning to attack the Soviet union . Man â™ª 2 : We have to prevent innocent people from getting hurt . Fx presents legion . Good evening . We are here tonight to talk about violence . Or maybe human nature . We are here to talk about human nature . Wait . A quote . the warlike man attacks himself . This is the root of all our problems . I mean " we . our fear of things we don 't understand . is ignorance . Figure your shit out . That 's my ... what I 'd say . There are two kinds of stories we tell our children . The first kind : there was a fuzzy little rabbit named frizzy-top fun adventure which he overcame through perseverance and by being adorable . This kind of story teaches empathy . in other words . The other kind : you 'll be sucked into the sea and drowned ! This kind of story teaches them fear . these two stories compete . Empathy and fear . a work in five acts about a fuzzy little bunny and what happened next . Let us begin . Syd : We went looking for truth . But found only lies . The doctor had disappeared . The old girlfriend hid behind a smile . What was real ? That was the mission . heard things . But could we believe our eyes ? Could David ? Woman : David ? Dr. pooley : What did the stars say ? Woman : My boy . Woman : My beautiful boy . wake up . Wake up . Odd . Extremely . right ? if that 's what he is . David : Andromeda . Cassiopeia . Syd : I 'm getting out tomorrow . Kissinger says I 'm clean . So I get to go home . No ! wake up . Cary : I could try a shot of adrenaline . No . Too risky . Agreed . Syd : David . where are you ? You 've got to get better so you can come home too . David . Wake up . his subconscious . I looked . I can 't find it . no . His mind is active . though ? Ptonomy : You know he can create a kind of mental something between reality and dream . An astral plane . We have been inside David 's memories three times . omissions . It 's as if we 've activated some kind of guardian . There 's something in David 's memory he does not want us to see . - Kerry . Kerry : Yes . Melanie : I have a mission for you . the three of you . I 'm sending you out . We need to find out exactly what happened to David before he went to clockworks . Syd : What about division three ? Melanie : That 's just a risk we 'll have to take . though ? 'Cause I 'm thinking " dangerous " is a better word . I 'm in . Melanie : You 're all going . Syd : What was real ? That was the mission . Keep an eye out . We can 't stay long . but I 'd say Dr. poole hasn 't been here in a few years . It 's weird ... Seeing it after visiting David 's memory . The curtains are completely different . Most people 's memories are unreliable ... that people say . And they change over time too . Your past is an illusion . There was a tear right there . The wall opened up and a red light came out . And the boy ran into the closet . And I followed . Wait ! the invented space . I looked for you . You weren 't in any memories of David I could find . Are you saying David created that space ? Ptonomy : It 's part of his ability : Psychic projection to create a simulated reality . Okay . Let 's see what she has to say . Who ? Ptonomy : The room . There you are . Objects have memory too . Is there any way ... Could we still be in David 's mind ? Ptonomy : A simulation ? this is real . How do you know ? 'Cause I know . I 'm pretty sure . How do you ... Put your hand here . Watch it . I won 't touch you . It 's not my first day . Just close your eyes . Man : Andromeda . Cassiopeia . Bootes . Canis major . Lupus . Telescopium . what did the stars say ? Did he ... Looks like the doctor came back while David was robbing the place . It doesn 't sound like David . but he 's not stable . Trust me . and then get dumped in a loony bin . I was in a loony bin . but you 're ... you 're a card trick . I read the report . He broke the doctor 's skull . Had to put the guy in a coma to get the swelling down . And that was with his fists . Imagine if he used his power . He 's a bomb . - What did the stars say ? - What ? " what did the stars say ? And I saw him just before the monster came . like a flash . audio tape . And his hands were ... - Are you saying ... - Glitches . Omissions . You 've seen his memories . gaps . What if ... I 've seen implanted memories before . You can always tell . Implanted from the outside . I 'm talking about ... David . Maybe he 's hidden his real memories behind fake ones . Why ? I don 't know . Lot of effort just to convince yourself your boyfriend 's a nice guy . Conversation 's on tape . What did the stars say ? I know he 's hiding things . and we 're out . What if he didn 't come in here to steal a radio or some coins ? Big score potential . What if he came here to get rid of evidence ? the one time he said too much . Syd : How do you find the facts when memory becomes a dream ? Woman : David . Syd : Alice went down the rabbit hole . Dorothy landed in oz . Or did she ? I was looking for the man I loved . Or did I just love the idea of him ? The face he showed me ? All I could do was follow the lines ... Man : Target approaching . Syd : Pull a string . The things he 'd done . The things he 'd said . Who are we if not the stories we tell ourselves ? Hello . Who 's that ? Kissinger : I 'm here . I exist ! I 'm in a cell ! We should speak quietly . They might ... Might be listening . Who ? Tell me your name . Amy ... haller . My god . The sister . Who are you ? My name is kissinger . I was ... David 's doctor . I went to the hospital to look for you . They said you didn 't exist . I do . I used to . Have they ... Did you tell them where he is ? No . I don 't know . I haven 't seen him since ... Did you ? No . but ... Did you know ... He wasn 't sick ? That ... that he had powers ? visions . Did you ? I think so . I should have . hospitals . he was so sweet . But he ... he moved . sometimes further . and you 'd follow it . He wouldn 't be there . conversations he couldn 't have heard . More than conversations ... Thoughts . I 'd catch him talking to people who weren 't there . Who are you talking to ? king . The dog . Your dog . David spoke of him often . Amy : Doctor . We didn 't have a dog . you are gonna see things . You will not feel the same about me . Woman : he found an address for Philly . Syd . Syd ! found an address for the girlfriend . Ex-girlfriend . Mm-hmm . So you live ... Inside his body . We share . Is that weird ? I 'll tell you a story . Ray and Irma whitecloud . and it 's a girl . Native girl . They decide to name her kerry . a skinny white boy comes out . Ray decides Irma had an affair . so now Irma 's a single mother raising this bastard runt . little boy Cary wakes up in his room . Kerry : And there is an eight-year-old native girl playing with his train set . but ... Cary : Then he figures out that ... She lives inside of him ... Cary and kerry : That they 're ... Two people in one body . Syd : That 's his side . What about you ? What do you mean ? with feelings . I 'm ... Asking what it 's like for you . okay ? whatever it is you guys do in the bathroom . And I get all the action . and I keep him safe . If that 's weird ... I 'm okay with it . Man : Electrical malfunction . Melanie : You sure you 're up for this ? Syd : Don 't worry . We 'll get the facts . Melanie : It 's just a risk we 'll have to take . Cary : A diving suit . You sure ? It 's not just coincidence with David gone . Maybe he 's waking up . but don 't get your hopes up . We 've been wrong before . Do you miss her ? Kerry ? Is that dumb ? No . It 's sweet . It still amazes me how she only ages when she 's outside your body . and here I am getting old . I wonder ? Is he ... He 's still here . His body . ah ! Oliver ? It 's me . Man : Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced ... - What was it ? - Nothing . I told you we need to replace this operating system . No . He 's trying to reach us . my love . Come back to us . Man : Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced visitor . Unannounced ... Wait . Drink ? Uh ... Sure . What 's real in this space is whatever you want it to be . So my feeling is why not wait in style ? Wait for what ? Where are we ? Sorry about the cold . It 's the only thing I can 't seem to fix in here . would you like to listen to something ? Uh ... Torrent downloaded from RARBG um ... dig that groove . it 's genius . Can you ... Can you turn it off ? Sorry . um ... I had a similar ... Proclivity ? Malady . I forget the word . What 's the word ? uh ... Drift . Right . And here is ... I was ... Unless I 'm not really awake . Maybe this is the drug . Tell me something . Do they still ... Is free love still a thing ? Girls in summer dresses with no bra ? Y ... Not really . It 's definitely ... Bras are back . Oh . Too bad . So ... right . there 's good news and there 's bad news . The bad news is it 's not the drug . You 're here in the astral plane . You went too far into the make-believe consciousness . where you can imaginify yourself a kingdom but nothing is ever real . And what 's the good news ? I 'm not alone anymore . How do you feel about beat poetry ? dreaming of your enumerations . What peaches and what penumbras . Whole families shopping at night . babies in the tomatoes . sir ? please . Don 't worry . He can 't get you in here . He " ? Your monster . Ah . He makes you forget . Clever . What are you ... like a dog trying to chew off its own tail . I 've seen it before . I thought . But Melanie said it was because of my powers . Melanie . I knew a Melanie once . You know what ? back to the ... They need me . Amy needs me . your sister . - How do you ... Oliver : I wouldn 't go out there . It 's waiting . The monster . and now it 's hunting you . There is no monster . It 's just me . I know that . It 's just me . It 's my psychology . monster as metaphor . I like it . But wrong . It 's part of you ; That 's true . But not like a symptom . More like a ... Parasite . What are you saying ? I 'm haunted ? that 's superstition . I 'm a scientist . I 'm saying maybe it 's good you 're here . Figure some things out . Defeat the dragon . the dragon wins . I can 't just ... People need me . Syd and Amy . So I am gonna get out of this place . I am not waiting . - How ? David : I don 't know . so I 'm guessing I 'll figure something out . Pity . Two more and we could have had a barbershop quartet . Right . but things get muddy out there in the vast subconscious . it 's not real unless you make it real . Come back any time . Wednesday 's karaoke night . soldiers in a secret war . the golem of myth . make-believe . Sometimes it felt like that to us too . I was a woman who couldn 't be touched ... In love with a man who wasn 't there . What was real ? that was the mission . Ptonomy : I need you to take the lead so I can scan her . Scan her ? I 'll look through her memories while you keep her busy . I need 30 to 40 minutes . How am I supposed to keep her busy for 30 to 40 minutes ? Buy a house . just whistle . right ? To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence . Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy 's resistance without fighting . Whatever . Oh ... And I 'm blind . Woman : And are we looking for a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom ? Kids . We 're hoping to have kids . wow . Congratulations . no . we 're not having kids . we 're talking . you don 't get ' em just by talking . but we were thinking about something on the West Side . Great . You want to take a look at some places ? More coffee ? no . I 've got a hard enough time sleeping as it is . Woman : David has the same problem . and sometimes he talks in his sleep . We don 't have to ... It 's not a session . He 's right . But I would like to hear more about this dog you guys are thinking of getting . His name 's Archie . David had a beagle when he was a kid . King . His name was king . everywhere . Woman : He sounds like just the cutest thing . but ... Amy must have some . I don 't keep a lot of stuff . A lot " ? We 're talking nothing . no evidence he was ever ... You know ... Had a past . Evidence he was ever ... You know ... Had a past . So you want to take a tour ? thanks . I think we 've found what we 're looking for . I 'm sorry . You look so familiar . Did you date someone named David ? Syd . Are you friends of his ? Do you know where he is ? we ... actually . But I just wanted you to know he said such nice things about you . Did he ... Did things end badly with you guys ? It 's ... I thought I could fix him . you know . He was always nice to me . Benny . Syd : You mean Lenny ? he was a ... I guess ? the one he did drugs with ... Unhand the reptile . don 't fight . Was a man ? a big guy . but not with his eyes . is there anything that you want to say ? A message ? Tell him ... They 're watching . Syd : We gonna talk about Benny ? Ptonomy : You saw the memories . his old female friend from the hospital . so did she end up stitched in David 's memory ? This would be an awesome place to have a fight . but whoever altered . David 's memory replaced the real dude with Lenny . ninjas on fast ropes . Why ? I don 't know . Let 's ask the doctor . Benny ... Which one was real ? Or were they one and the same ? A man who became a woman ? Or maybe it was just an illusion . we 're here about David haller . I don 't talk about my patients . Please . He 's in trouble . He told us that he broke into your office to steal things so that he could buy drugs . We think there 's another story . and you 'll never see us again . I swept upstairs . Nothing . Same drill . You talk . I 'll search his memories . it 's ... We 're not spies . let 's let him talk . Thank you . Of course . So you 're a lighthouse keeper now . I 'd like to think I was always a lighthouse keeper . How long did you treat David ? Dr. poole : On and off for three years . Why off ? Dr. poole : People with schizophrenia are subject to delusional thinking . almost desperate to work . But when he went off it ... What about drugs or booze ? good and bad . There was a friend . A man or woman ? A man . Benny . a negative effect on David 's treatment . David ? Before the break-in ? Days or weeks ? He doubled his sessions . It was clear that there were things he wanted to say but couldn 't until his last appointment . Syd : Dr. poole ? What did the stars say ? You 're in love with him . Yes . I 'd very much like to see David again . Could you take me to him ? Why ? Because I have the same question you do . kids . Now I can 't see out of one eye . I can 't concentrate . He ruined my life . I just want to ask him why . So he 's in charge . Nobody 's in charge . We 're here together . And Melanie bird ? Is she not the leader of your little band ? Syd : What did you just say ? It 's a trap . - Shit . - Upstairs ! talk . My turn . We 've been looking for you . That was a mistake . Sir ? Target 's acquired . - The other ? - Secured but feisty . It 's a trick . He 's not ...

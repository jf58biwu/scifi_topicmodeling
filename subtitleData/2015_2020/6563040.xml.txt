Previously on " second chance " ... It worked . I 'm cured . Mary 's going to live . Now I 'll never get lookinglass or otto , And without otto , you can 't have george . The dna in the killer 's blood was artificially engineered , Just like the dna sample matched to your family . I 'm not the only one . [ both grunting ] Are you albert lin ? ! Are you trying to get home ? [ gunshots ] [ screams ] Clean the rest of this up . None of this comes back to me or this company . Alexa : Otto threw me out before I was even formed , And I just need to look at you , And I remember why I 'm doing this . Thing she has with pritchard is a real thing , isn 't it ? She 's not in love with him . It 's going back the way it was . [ speaking twinspeak ] what does that mean ? It means " I don 't want you to go . " [ screaming ] Why aren 't you in the hospital ? Knee was dislocated . They popped it back in , But we 've got bigger problems . The fbi is closing the case . The report says that they caught the killer . What ? Yep . They found a john doe out by the amusement park - - O.D. ' d on pcp . I 'm looking at him right now . He 's not who we fought . He is not albert lin . Someone put this body out there for us to find . They 're covering up what happened . But there 's blood and prints at the scene . That 's all been changed . It 's this john doe 's prints at the crime scene now . Blood lab says pcp now , not transgenic . Someone switched a body , And they hacked into the fbi 's server . Anyone we know do stuff like that ? Yeah . Otto . I 'm on my way to see him right now . You just keep digging . Arthur , is otto still at lookinglass ? Yes . Shall I tell him you 're headed in to see him ? No , but let me know if he leaves . You need to let me deal with this . Mary , that thing that I fought , That thing that killed eight people , It could only have been created by one person . We need to find albert lin before he does it again , So if you 're afraid of how I might question your brother , You should just stay home . I 'm afraid for you . You need to be back in the tank in just over an hour , So let me deal with otto . You protected him your whole life . If otto did this - - If otto did this ? ! Who else could do this ? ! No one . And I won 't protect him from what he did . Do you believe me ? [ sighs ] yeah , I believe you . Good . I 'll take my own car . No , otto is dangerous . We go together . You 're of no use to anyone once you start breaking down . Well , then we better find albert lin Before that starts happening ! You 're just a stubborn old man ! Yes . I am . [ door opens ] [ speaking twinspeak ] He 's going to ask you some questions . You need to answer . He thinks it 's better this way . Transgenic - - that 's the word of the day , otto . Transgenic , like my blood . That 's how you engineered it , isn 't it ? Transgenic blood was found at a crime scene , Blood from a creature that used to albert lin . I 'm not the only one . You brought back albert lin , didn 't you ? Where is he now ? Please , otto . Tell him . Please . Did you bring back albert lin ? That thing you brought back killed eight people . Now , you listen to me . I 'm gonna close this distance between us And use the strength that you gave me Until you tell me where albert lin is . Do you understand ? Then tell him what you do know . [ slurring ] the recon team with the tranq darts , You - - you sent them . You - - you sent them . Your pupils are dilated . I think you should go back to the tank now . Mary : Arthur . Ask alexa to step in . It 's a 12-minute helicopter ride to the house And another 6 minutes for full submersion in the tank . I think you should leave now . I 'm not going anywhere . Yes , you are . [ door opens ] he knows about albert lin . But now you need to go . Yes , mary ? Mr. Pritchard isn 't feeling well . Please take him to the heliport . Go . I 'll see you at home . Oh , come on . [ door shuts ] Tell me about albert lin . Everything I did was for you . My , god . What else is there ? We are supposed to take care of each other . It 's what our parents would 've wanted . What you made killed eight people ! But you were so sick . You know what 's sick , otto ? What you 've been doing . What I let you do , that 's what 's so sick . Everything was for you . But now you won 't speak our language to me , But you teach it to him ? Why ? ! Because I spend my whole life Protecting you from the world When I should 've been protecting the world from you . Otto , I ... Please , I ... Otto . Otto . Arthur . Yes , mary . After I leave , lock the doors . Yes , mary . I 'll be watching , otto . All you have to do is tell me about albert lin . That is all you have to do . [ door opens , shuts ] [ beep , lock engages ] Arthur . Yes , otto . On the server , there is a file named shiva . In it , you will find a command That 'll allow me to override mary . Execute that command now . [ beeping , ding ] command executed . Unlock the doors . [ beep , lock disengages ] Send a loop of me sitting here to her video feed . [ beeping ] And have support send up a 3-d printer . What are you going to print ? A gun . [ door opens ] Helen : Hello ! Anyone home ? Gracie ? Hey . Um , sorry to stop by so early , But there 's a problem in my kitchen . What kind of problem ? There 's no food in it . Do you have any of that granola with the little clusters ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'll get it . Right here . Helen : You , um , need a lift to school ? Nah , mabel 's taking me . Um , they 're playing " the big sleep " At the grand illusion tonight . You want to go ? Uh , I think I have plans . Oh . May I ask , these plans , are they with garret ? Dad told me to stop seeing him . So , obviously , you stopped . [ sighs ] he 's wrong about garret . Maybe . Ever since mom died , It 's like dad put his life on hold , you know ? [ sighs ] And now he wants me to live that way , too ? You 're 17 . You 're not gonna give me The " there will be other guys " speech , are you ? No . That 's not necessarily true . It 's not ? I had a guy I really liked when I was your age . But granddad didn 't like him , so I gave him up . Turns out granddad was wrong . Of course , he never lived to see it . What 's going on , otto ? Why 'd you want to see me ? Why don 't you come upstairs with me ? Lock the doors . [ beep , locks engage ] Well , looks like we 'll be staying in here , then . Mary hates me . Mary hates me because of you . Albert lin killed eight people . Mary blames me for that . She thinks I made him . I didn 't . I started to , but the process wasn 't right yet , So I flushed him before he had a face . Someone finished him . Someone found him and finished him . It was you . You got me . It was me and my team . We finished him , just not very well . You stole what I made . You spied on me , on my work . [ chuckling ] I 'm not a spy . I 'm your fan , otto . I wish I could do what you do , but I can 't . No one can . But I can help you do greater things . Otto , I am the man that wants the best for you . Mary wanted the best for me , But now she hates me because of you ! If you think that 's true ... Pull the trigger . You just have to take the safety off first . Let me . [ click ] there it is . Safety 's off . Go ahead . If you think I 'm your enemy , shoot me . Come on . Go ahead . Mary hates me . But not because of me . Otto , you cheated death to save her life . You performed a miracle , And now she abandoned you , didn 't she ? [ voice breaking ] yes . And you brought your pain to me . [ crying ] yes . Give it to me , otto . I can take it . [ crying ] [ sighs ] We 're gonna turn your pain into power . Just me and you , otto . Just me and you . Okay . Hey . Hi . You ready ? We 're doing this . [ breathes deeply ] We 're really doing this . [ chuckles ] Yeah , we 're really doing this . You leave a note telling him you 're not coming back ? Uh , no . My aunt helen was in there . I was afraid she would find it before I left . You should let your dad know you 're okay so he doesn 't worry . Okay . Yeah , um ... Here , uh , take a video of me , and we 'll send it . If I talk to him , he might convince me not to go . Alexa . [ beep ] yes , mary ? Can you please knock on otto 's door and ask him if he 's hungry ? When he gets like this , he forgets to eat . Otto 's not here , mary . Well , I 'm watching him on the feed . Well , he 's not in his office . He left shortly after you did . It 's a loop . Arthur ? Where 's otto ? I can 't tell you that . Arthur . Yes , otto ? Remove yourself from the lookinglass corporate servers . That will cause a catastrophic cascade of events . I know . Do it now , please . Alexa , did otto say where he was going ? Um , no . I said something to him I shouldn 't have . I hurt him . No , mary . It 's not your fault . I mean , you would never do anything to hurt otto . I 'm really sorry you 're in such pain . [ beep , whirring down ] Otto , lookinglass is down . Now ... Delete yourself from the house . If I leave the house server , The tank won 't support mr . Pritchard . I 'm gone . You have to come with me . Yes , otto . I 'm leaving the house . [ beep ] [ chime , beeping ] [ whirring down ] Arthur ? [ alarm blares ] Arthur ? You need to answer me . Door . You all done in there ? Shut it all down and find me at connor 's . Yes , otto . â ™ ª Arthur ! [ panting ] arthur ! Arthur ! No . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . You will not go . You will not leave me . Do you hear me ? You will not go . [ gagging ] [ coughing ] I 'm okay . It 's okay . [ coughs ] No , it 's not . [ door opens ] I just heard from connor . He has otto now , so it 'll be soon . I thought that we could get you clothes for after . Won 't that be nice ? All of these people lived Where a man named albert lin used to live . I 've heard you use that name , haven 't I ? I don 't want to see that . Albert lin was the one before you . That 's not going to be you . I promise . You 're gonna be young and healthy And take me across the threshold like when we were married . I have loved you more than I thought ever possible . Mm . I love you still , george . Because we were right for each other . Mm-hmm . So much about this isn 't right . What else is there but us ? This thing in the paper , You lying to the woman who trusts you , And the worst part is that man connor . He 's helping us . He 's a sociopath . No , george . None of this is right . Go to mary , tell her the truth . Maybe she can stop this , stop him . Maybe all of this should stop . [ sighs ] You are just tired , george . You don 't mean any of that . And soon you won 't be tired anymore , okay ? I promise . I ... I-I am tired . Yeah . You have to promise me that you trust me . Okay . Of course . Of course . Without arthur , the tank is useless . So , I got what , about a day ? No , because we 're gonna find otto and make him fix this . We 're not gonna find him if he doesn 't want to be found . This is otto we 're talking about . We have to try . No , we don 't . If I 've got one day left , that 's not how I 'm gonna spend it . My son is out there , Tracking down that thing that otto created . That 's where I 'm gonna be . Want to come ? [ chuckles softly ] No . I 'm going to find otto , get him to fix this . If it gets to be 24 hours And you feel it coming on , You might not want to let duval watch . Why ? Your cell structure will break down , And there will be a lot of pain . Yeah , well , we don 't want duval to see that . [ speaking twinspeak ] What 's that mean ? I think you know . Oh , otto . What did we do ? [ growling ] Man : A digital bombshell went off today With ripples far beyond the tech sector . Hardware , software , and social-media giant lookinglass Is down , leaving its 2 billion users stranded , Trading on its stock suspended , and its twin founders , Mary and otto goodwin , unavailable for comment . I need the cctv in otto 's office From the last few days restored . I can dig that out , but , uh , I don 't think that 's a priority . We 're practically stealing wi-fi From the coffee shop down the street . We 're dead in the water here . I understand where we are , but I need to see what happened In my brother 's office , and you need to do it . I 'm on it . Alexa . Alexa ? Alexa , I - - [ sighs ] Tick , tick , tick . Oh , god . Thank god you 're here . Why ? What 's happening ? It 's duval . He 's real worked up . I 've never seen him like this before . Duval : Yes , I 'll hold . [ sighs ] It 's gracie . I think I told her something I shouldn 't have . I know I have no warrant , But I need you to find this boy 's phone . Because I am in the middle of a multiple homicide , And I am asking you to do it as a favor for me . There 's a video message from gracie . Just press the play button . [ cellphone beeps ] yes , I will . Gracie : Dad , I love you , And I know that you 're going to be mad , But ... I 'm leaving with garret . It 's my life , and we want to be together . [ sighs ] I can do this . You raised me to be strong , okay ? Let me go . I love you . [ cellphone beeps ] yeah , I 'm here . Okay , fine . [ cellphone beeps ] Well , the bureau won 't track that boy 's phone , Gracie 's is off , and I take it from the news That lookinglass can 't help me today . Yeah . All right , I 'm gonna go to garret 's place . Maybe I can find out where they went . Maybe you don 't . Maybe this is what she has to do today , And maybe tracking albert lin is what you have to do today . I will take care of that , but I 'm gonna take an hour To get my daughter back in this house first . Well , what if it takes more than an hour ? Then it takes me more than an hour . What 's going on with you ? She 's a big girl , duval . She knows what she wants . Maybe we just need to start trusting her . Maybe we should leave those decisions to her father . [ siren wailing in distance ] Want a drink ? I thought we were just picking something up . We are , but , uh ... My buddy 's on tour so ... We 're not in any kind of rush . Okay , but I , uh - - I do want to get out of seattle . You know , come on . Let 's not wait . Let 's just play house for a while . [ chuckles softly ] Otto : This coding ... Is my work ... From my labs . You 've been in my labs . Otto , I took your work , and I cared for it . But the ones we tried to bring back on our own , They were reborn dead . Albert has the precursor . I could bring him back . I hadn 't perfected the process yet , So I aborted him , but you 're attempting Regeneration without the precursor . You can 't restore life without it . It only works on 1 in 10 million . That 's not what you thought once . I found this at your old lab . You believed you could make it happen without it . You thought you had a way you could bring anyone back . What , because I don 't have the genetic precursor , I 'm - - I 'm chained to this body ? I-I 'll grow old and die Because I don 't have a twist in my friggin ' dna ? I can 't accept that , and I won 't , otto . Neither should you . That was just a daydream ... A sketch . I make them all the time . It helps with parallel thought . But it doesn 't have to be a dream . Well , just think of everything you 've done in your 30 years . Now , what if you had 300 ? 3,000 ? And not just you and me , but minds who think like us . Mary would never have let me . A vaccine would have to be made . We 'd need a live donor with the precursor . We can 't use him . We need a ... We need a clean donor Who hasn 't gone through the regeneration process . Yeah , I see that . For lack of a better word , you 'd need a virgin . [ upbeat rock playing ] [ knock on door ] One minute ! Were you expecting someone ? Just a couple of friends of mine . Give us a second here ! What ? What friends ? What 's going on ? Nothing 's going on . It 's just a couple of friends . They 're cool . Who are they , garret ? Let me get the door . Why did you bring me here ? I told you . [ knock on door ] Man : Open up , garret , huh ? Everyone 's gonna think that I ran away . Come on , garret . Open up . Just a sec ! Just a sec ! Help ! You got to let this happen . [ grunts ] When I got thrown out of the army , Mr. Graff gave me a job . He gets what he wants , and he wants you . So you just let this happen now , gracie , okay ? I 'm her grandfather , okay ? You know she and I have always been close . Don 't act like I don 't know who she is . Yeah , you 're her grandfather , but how hard is that ? That 's a job with no responsibility . You want to play dad , you got to put in the hours . I 'm going after gracie . You coming or not ? Helen : It 's gracie . It 's gracie . She left a message . [ upbeat rock music playing and gracie whimpering ] Oh , my god . [ breath catches ] [ cellphone beeps ] oh , my god . Oh , my god . I 've got an app to find her phone . Got it . Got an address . Let 's go . Need some help there , bro ? [ chuckles ] You got her phone , right ? Yeah . No . Give me that . I got this . Come here , sweetheart . Come on . [ chuckles ] whoo ! Otto : Where did you get this ? I was transcribing video notes from mary 's meeting , And I saw it . I thought you should know . I never did trust that pritchard . Was it wrong for me to show you ? No . [ speaking twinspeak ] what does that mean ? It means " I don 't want you to go . " How do you say , " I don 't want to go " ? [ button clicks ] George ! I got something for you . George , what have you done ? George : " my darling , know that I tried in this life To give you everything you ever wanted . " [ crying ] no . " we are meant to be fragile creatures . Our humanity comes not from our strength , But from living with this weakness . " [ crying ] " there 's no life without death at its end . And I 've made sure my end will be permanent . I 'm sorry . We had a beautiful life . But now ... It is over . " [ fire whooshes ] She was here . She called for help from here . Play the message again . " graff " ? Hmm ? Gracie sent me a text . I didn 't get it because I had my finder app on . It just came through . Graff ? Connor graff . He was gonna merge with lookinglass If mary didn 't go into remission . He was gonna take over the company . Why would she send me that name ? Let 's find out . Just let it happen , gracie-loo-hoo . [ indistinct conversations ] Man : No , you cannot call her Because she has a lookinglass phone which no longer works . Can I take a message ? Okay . Uh , just a little slower , please . The chairman of what senate subcommittee ? [ conversations stop ] Connor graff ? Someone went to a lot of trouble To make it look like gracie ran away , But she sent duval a text with his name . You 're intimate with connor graff . Yes . Then what would a billionaire biotech c.E.O. Want with my daughter ? Oh , god . It 's not just gracie . It 's all of them . They 're all with connor . That must be where otto and arthur went , to connor - - And alexis , too . They 're all with connor . They went , but he took her . Why ? She has nothing to do with any of this . But she does . She 's a pritchard . Gracie has the genetic precursor . The regeneration process would work with her . Why not take me , then ? It skipped a generation . The only two people on the west coast With the precursor are you and gracie . You have to go get her . You have to go get her now . Where would he take her ? The oncentric building has four dedicated floors of labs . She would be there . A lot of the labs are highly secure With limited access . Highly secure - - we 'll see about that . Duval . Duval ! Where exactly are you going , kiddo ? To get my daughter . Oh , yeah ? Just gonna walk in there , ask them where she is ? No , I 'm gonna do what my dad would 've done . I 'm gonna show them my badge first and then my fist . So come on . Let 's go . Just wait . [ voice breaking ] what is your problem here ? He has gracie ! Or did you miss that part ? You 're not gonna get close to a guy like connor , Even with a badge . He 's surrounded by security and lawyers . You need a warrant just to get in the door . A warrant ? And what do I tell the judge , That connor graff kidnapped my daughter Because she has something in her dna That lets her get regenerated like my dad ? I said you 'd need a warrant . I didn 't say anything about a judge . I need to print - - on paper . I don 't think we have a paper printer . We 're - - we 're paperless . We don 't have one printer ? There 's one in childcare . My kid does projects on it . Bring it to otto 's office . James : " this search warrant hereby grants the sworn officer Access to any and all property . " You 've done this before ? Once or twice . Have you told him how much time you have left ? No , and now 's not the time . When you get to oncentric , you can look for otto , too . We 're going for gracie . Anything of hers - - a shirt , a scarf . They ask for a piece of clothing when someone is lost . Where is she , duval ? Isn 't she with that boy ? Please , helen , just do this . Bring it to us . [ phone beeps ] [ whirring ] Let 's go . [ siren winds down and police radio chatter ] Get the warrant ? Yeah . Are you gonna let me see it ? It 'd be better if you didn 't . Be better for you if you could say I told you it was good . [ sighs ] what are we looking for ? My daughter . â ™ ª Can I help you ? This is a federal warrant for the search of this building . Everyone needs to step away from their work . All the doors shall be unlocked . Graff 's office is which way ? We 'll take graff . You take the team through the building . Okay , everybody , work the grid . That 's as far as you go . Like hell it - - [ grunts ] [ pounding on door ] that was a bit extreme , but I 'll go with it for now . How can I help the fbi ? Open this door ! And don 't even bother with that piece of crap warrant . I called about it when I saw you pull in . Open up ! Where 's my daughter ? I-I don 't know your daughter . Wrong answer . That help you remember , huh ? Her name is gracie pritchard . She has the genetic precursor . The genetic what now ? You will tell me where she is . Gracie who ? I honestly don 't know who you 're talking about . Oh , you honestly ? Honestly , huh ? Security guard : Open up ! Duval , throttle back . We need him talking . [ strained ] you 're making a big mistake here . Where is she ? ! Get off ! Let me go ! Where is she ? ! Let me go ! Where is she ? ! Let me go ! Calm down ! Calm down . That 's enough ! That agent attacked me ! You 've got a big problem here . Duval : He took my daughter . He took her . I know what it looks like , but there was no other way . He took my daughter . Let me tell you what this looks like . It looks like you were assaulting mr . Graff And your c.I. Was attempting to restrain you . It looks like you knowingly led a team of agents in here With a fraudulent warrant . You need to let me explain . No , you need to meet me downstairs , both of you . These agents will make sure You don 't get into anymore trouble . Mr. Graff , I want to assure you None of this was approved by the bureau . Just talk to my lawyers . Okay , honey ? Stand down . Did your c.I. Know that warrant was fake ? No , ma 'am , he didn 't . None of the agents did , just me . Okay , I want you out of here . Gracie 's probably just with some friends . I 'll find her . I promise . Graff let us search it , the offices and the labs . We used the dog with gracie 's scent . She 's not here . He doesn 't have her . Gracie ran away . [ voice breaking ] they made it look like that . Agent pritchard - - He made it look like gloria 's death was a hit-and-run , Made it look like that john doe did the killings . Why ? Why would he do that ? [ sighs ] Gracie has a precursor in her dna . She can be regenerated , brought back from the dead . I know it sounds crazy . My father has it , too . Your father has it ? Yeah . Him . That 's my father . Test his dna . He has it , too . That 's why connor took her . Agent pritchard , I 'm relieving you of duty Effective immediately . You will surrender your gun and your badge to me . I 'm remanding you to a 72-hour psych hold . Charges will be brought against you for assault And falsifying a court order . You will allow these agents to place you in restraints . [ handcuffs click ] You need to go back in there . He has my daughter . Please . Oh , man . Just like his dad . â ™ ª What happened to you ? Just rugby . Is everything ready here ? This is what mary said not to do . Mary said not to dream . I mean , she got hers . Why can 't you have yours ? Arthur . Yes , otto . Begin taking notes . [ beep ] Procedure 001 . First attempt at stripping the precursor from the dna of ... Her name is gracie pritchard . I know her name . Call her test subject zero .

Let me - - let you what , alexa ? Otto is gone , lookinglass is gone , And soon , pritchard will be , too . What are you here to take from me now ? [ crying ] nothing . I just came to help you .

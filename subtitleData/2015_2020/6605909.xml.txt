 Previously on " Hunters " ... That audio message said blood would be spilt , and it has been . The bastard who took Abby . We find out where he is , we find your wife . My wife is not one of you . You wanna see Abby now ? Come on . We got some forensics off the body in the warehouse . Turns out there was heroin in the victim 's system . It 's not Abby . We 're everywhere , and you can 't stop us . Slavich 's wife . Uhh ! I tore that woman to shreds , like an animal ... and I liked it . Agent Regan is shedding like a freakin ' cobra . Slavich 's last words to me were about Hunters being inside the ETU . Regan 's confused . I think she 's one of them . She better watch herself . _ - Hey ! - What is it , Allison ? Could you play something else ? Are you serious ? The noise hurts my head . You are so weird . Allison ? What happened ? What 'd you do ? It was an accident , Daddy . - Oh , my God . - I 'm ... I 'm sorry ! - She 's okay . - Ted , everything all right out there ? We need help ! Call 911 ! Call 911 ! They need some help ! The junkie body we found in McCarthy 's warehouse had Columbian Olvidos ' heroin in her system . DEA got pictures of McCarthy and the Quins with the Olvidos last year . They had no idea who or what they were dealing with . Quins ? Those are the freaks I saw at the farmhouse . That 's what we 're calling ' em . What 's happening ? This picture was taken on a road leading to a drug compound deep in the Columbian jungle . Hunters and heroin , nd deep like a Mujahidin situation . Tried and true method of raising funds . Girl Scouts have cookies , terrorists have dope . Regan . You getting all this ? The Hunters are running drugs in the jungle , and you 're sending me a new guy to find them . - Got it . - Count me in . Agent Carroll has history with narcotics , Briggs . It 's not him I 'm worried about . You think I need protecting ? Oh , let 's ask Jessie Slavich . Agent Regan is the only reason you 're still here to shoot your mouth off . You and Carroll . My two cents ... if we 're going into the jungle to catch Hunters , another soldier couldn 't hurt . All right ... Briggs , you 're in . Work together , find this camp , shut it down . Capture any Hunters or collaborators you may find . There are some local guys we 've used before . You can trust them . I 'll handle the McCarthy cleanup . That is all . I 'm taking these . Family pictures ? I was kidding . Lighten up . Thought you were still a married man ? I 'm not getting down to my skin in here , so ... Yeah . Um , about your skin thing . We 're still on that ? Go on . Is there any other way to , you know , tell if someone is ... whatever you are . I get urges , physical urges . They 're hard to control . You mean physical like , um ... Yes , that . And other stuff . Impulse control . Hunger , rage . Aww , is she blaming her feelings ? Next she 'll say it was PMS . Give her a break . A tiger doesn 't change its stripes . Where we 're going , were gonna need everything she 's got in her . Allison ... what are you doing ? You said that hurts your ears . It does . Sweetie ... What happened to Nicole ... was a mistake . No , it wasn 't . I wanted her to stop , so I pushed her . But you didn 't mean to hurt her . This was not your fault . Janine and Amber said it was . They told me they 're not gonna be my friends anymore . The reason this happened to Nicole ... is because we 're different . You ... me , your mom . I 'm gonna show you the truth . And it might be scary . But I need you to be strong . Now , watch closely . Try not to turn away . Daddy , no ! Stop ! Stop ! - Keep ... keep watching . - Dad , please ! Don 't look away , Allison . This is what we are . This is in me , and it 's in you , too . And it 's why you hurt Nicole ... That isn 't inside me . It isn 't . Hey ... it 's okay . It 's okay . I don 't ever want to hurt anyone . Then don 't . We 'll never find anything in here on our own . They 'll turn up . They 're hired guns . No show , no dough . Hola . Buenos dias . I 'm Carroll . This is Briggs . Regan . Jackson sent us . One of you the C.O. ? Psst ! Alejandro . But they ... call me Mato . Welcome to my jungle . The Olvidos ' drug camp is somewhere in this part of the jungle . I had to guess , I 'd say here . But you don 't know for sure ? Mm ... The plantation is run by cold-blooded killers . They keep it hidden . Guard the perimeter with traps and snipers . And these guys ... puro cabrons . Former MFC . Military . That and FARC . They 're soldiers we grew up with who decided they wanted a payday instead of freedom . You can thank Jackson and his CIA friends for that . So they got kids guarding the candy store . Kids own the candy store . The Olvidos , they don 't play . They cut your eyes out for stealing . But you ... _ But no one has ever made it to that camp uninvited . Not the army , not your DEA ... no one . You 're sure you want to do this ? Why , you getting cold feet ? Me ? No ... I just want to be sure you won 't run away when the fan hits the shit . You worry about your own . We 're sure as hell not backing down . Mato says the drug camp is ten miles in . He 'll get us there by nightfall . Not bad for a guy who did his tours of duty in Kandahar . I 'd take Afghanistan over this FernGully shit any day . Yeah , I hate this green stuff , too . You 're a vegetarian . Isn 't this all just ... salad ? Now I 'm being led by Dora the Explorer . Best keep that attitude to yourself . We need it . Especially if there are Hunters out there . An Olvidos welcome . Ladies first . You hearing anything ? Hold on ! Mato ! - Hold fire ! - Wait ! Hold fire ! Workers . Armed . They could have killed us all . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm not gonna hurt you . You 're okay now . You 're safe . What did she say ? Someone came out of the jungle and took her mother . Una Monstruo . Allison ! Allison , open the door ! What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? - It 's just weed . - You need to leave , now . Oh , my God ! Was that an earthquake ? What 's happening ? The people I told you about , the ones we can 't trust . They 're here . Come on , hurry . My ears ! Mom ! Dad , I 'm scared . What 's happening ? Take this . Climb Allegheny . Follow your instincts . I 'll come get you when I can . But I can 't just leave . What about Mom ? Allison , listen , I need you to be my brave girl . Okay ? Just follow your instincts . You 'll be fine . Now out the window . Now . Go , now ! She says a monster took her mother . Ask her again . We need to know exactly what she saw . It 's La Mojana . It 's a local legend . A woman that changes shape , takes people into the jungle and eats them . The cartel encourages it to keep peasants out of the jungle . Si . La Mojana . La Mojana . We need to get her back to the camp . No , no , no ... she stays . We 're walking into a shit storm , and I need every soldier I got . She 's just a kid . I 'm taking her back . You got a job to do ... with us . Flynn 's right . Oh ... we got La Mojana out there , and suddenly you need me . Yo , G.I. Joe Barbie , she 's a big girl . I was slitting throats when I was her age . You want your payday like Jackson promised ? Send your weakest man to take the girl back to camp , otherwise , we take her . And you go home empty-handed . Choice is yours , jefe . Carlos . _ Gracias . De nada . Vamos . When do we tell him we 're fighting monsters and not a drug cartel ? We don 't tell them anything . And they 're not monsters . They 're just not human . If you 're reading this , it means I 'm no longer with you . You 're on your own now , and you have to be strong . No matter what you do , I am your father , and you 're my little girl . And I will always love you . Check it out . Straight ahead . I think we found our camp . Looks empty . No guards , nothing . Ghost town . Regan ? I don 't hear a thing . Let 's move in from below . Clear . Empty . The bodies outside must be the workers . - A massacre . - Clear . No bullet wounds . No signs of firefight . Just ... Ripped apart . What the hell could have done this ? Flynn ? What did you find ? Footprints . They look fresh . Hey ... yeah , we searched the entire camp . There 's no one left here alive . Nothing more to see . No , we 're not leaving . We go now , we might make it back before dark . Oh , is it past their bedtime ? Yeah ... yeah . 'Cause we did our job ... got you to the camp . That 's what I told Jackson we 'd do , and it 's done . Is this your jungle ? Si . Then act like it . You 're not here for a drug bust . Briggs ... let 's set up a watch . We 'll take shifts till morning . Mato ... you and your men can clean up the bodies outside . We 'll search the lab . Ptuh ! They were producing heroin . Look at this . Check this out . That body wasn 't killed like the ones outside . It 's the same wounds as the junkie in McCarthy 's warehouse . I 've raided dozens of drug labs , I 've never seen anything like this . Something else was going on . It 's still warm . They were destroying evidence . And people . No loose ends . Like they were one step ahead of us . Slavich told me they had someone on the inside . A mole ? That 's crazy . What is that ? Yeah , it 's skin . Yeah . It 's some kind of tissue , not human . What the hell were they doing here ? Taking the pain away . You want a medal ? My break 's almost over . Shoo . Crazy fu ... bitch . I 'll call you ! Not . Hey . What are you doin ' ? None of your business , dick wad . What did you say ? You heard me , donut ass . Up against the wall . Let him go ! Let him go , or I 'll shoot ! Hear anything ? Is it out there ? I don 't know . Could be . Can 't do much till morning . At least Briggs will be the first one getting ripped apart . What ? After all the shit he gives you for being a Hunter ? Briggs has his reasons for hating me . And loving me . It 's complicated . Did you two , um ... No . No . God , no . I 'm not his type . Besides , he 's kind of a loner , in case you hadn 't figured that out yet . Can 't say I blame him . I 've seen human beings do some heinous shit . But I 've never seen anything like that . This helps . Ah . So alcohol doesn 't affect you like ... No . No . But I like the ritual . It makes me feel normal . It 's pretty much the opposite for me . I like how it makes me feel not normal . Did you always look ... so ... What ? Human ? As far as I can remember . Thought I was , until my parents told me I wasn 't . Your wife ... you never suspected ? What ? That she could be from outer space ? No . Had no damn reason to think she might be . But , watching you ... I 'd say it 's possible . Hey . Psst , psst . Come on . Miguel ! Miguel ! ¿ Como estas ? You 're gonna fry , you bastard . This killed all of Mato 's men . What the hell is that ? Let 's get it away . What was that ? Whatever it was ... it wasn 't human . Where 's my cell phone ? I 'm calling in backup . The whole God damn army if I have to . We will find that thing and go kill it ... Wanna tell me what the hell that was about ? Containment protocol . Jackson 's orders . He saw too much . He was about to talk . She 's right . ETU rules . We can 't let any of this get out . Whatever killed his men is still out there . We need to notify Jackson , get moving . Regan , if I hadn 't have joined the unit , would you have ... contained me ? Not in human form ? Well , what form is it in ? I don 't know , exactly . All I know for sure is that it 's a Hunter . And Mato saw it ? Has he been ... It 's been handled . Your protocol left us shorthanded . We need additional support . Eyes in the sky . I 'll see what I can do . We need it now . Can 't wait till the morning . - Understood . - That thing can hunt at night . It has the advantage . You have a location on the target ? It 's injured , scared . I think it 'll head to the mountains . You think or you know ? That 's what I would do . That makes sense with what we understand about their language . Higher elevation means more miles to anticipate potential attacks . We could have a drone out there in an hour . And then what happens ? 22-year-old kid from Iowa with an Xbox controller and a Snowden complex gets one of these things in his sights ? How do we contain that ? We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . I 'll reach out to Langley . If we wanna catch this thing , we gotta leave now . Has ETU ever caught one that doesn 't look like you ? We 've never captured one alive in any form . Then we better , uh , catch this one , right ? How we gonna find it in the dark ? You can find anything if you want it badly enough . Hello , Allison . My name is Truss Jackson . Homeland Security . I 'm not here to hurt you . Stop staring , you dirty old freak . What , you never seen a girl before ? Not like you . I have an ... old photograph of you that I put into the system years ago , just in case you ever got arrested . And here you are . Cute kid . But that 's not me . Allison Regan of Circleton , West Virginia . Daughter of Ted and Liana Regan . Never heard of ' em . Disappeared age 16 after a home invasion by unidentified intruders . You sure that 's not who you are ? Go . Langley said no . - You have to abort . - Why ? Bullshit ! Without backup , you 're vulnerable . Without a drone , you 're blind . It 's too dangerous . It 's injured . We have the advantage . It 's a new form of Hunter . Abort . That 's an order . You 're breaking up . You said report ? Abort ! I said abort . Copy that ! We 'll complete the mission and report , over . Carroll ! We 're gonna catch shit for that . Well , we better make it worth it . In the trees ! Briggs ! Briggs ! Ohh , you piece of shit ! - I 'm okay . - A perimeter trap from the drug cartel . Oh , now you tell me . Ready ? On three . - Go on . - One ... The clicks are getting fainter . All right , you go . I 'll take care of Briggs . She could get ripped by whatever that thing is . Or she tears it up . What they call a win-win . Right . Uhh ! So what 's your beef with Regan ? Oh , I don 't like human Hunters like you do . She 's been pretty damn useful . She 's not the only one I 've met . I was with Australian Special Forces in Afghanistan . We thought we were hitting a terrorist cell . Turned out to be just one guy in a room . Two of us went in . Opened fire , both clips . Nothing . And then ... it leapt at Brendan and it ripped him apart . But slowly ... playfully . Like a cat . And the whole time , it kept looking at me . Like it was a show . Hunters took the one you love . They did that to me , too . You can 't trust her . And whatever they look like on the surface ... they 're monsters underneath . You 're ruthless . World domination cometh . You get the killer instinct from your parents ? My parents are dead , aren 't they ? Truth is , we don 't know much about anything about ... your parents , about you , about any of it . So you don 't know shit . Not about me . No one does . You kept his letter from your dad for years . Everybody needs someone . Your parents ... they were like you . Weren 't they ? Yeah . They were like me . And what are you ? I don 't know .

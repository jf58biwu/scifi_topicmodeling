We stay here until Dad gets Dana . As long as the air is breathable . That vent leads outside . Outside is poisonous . And dad took the respirators .

Help me open it ! - No ... - The air 's poison . I know about silicates , Dad . I can 't put that on . - Why not ? - Because it makes me - claustrophobic , okay ? - Damn it .

Good girl . All right . All right you 're good . Good girl . [ creature shrieking ] - [ screams ] - Get down . Get down . Hurry . Oh , God . It 's coming for us ! [ screams ] [ panting ] Don 't trigger a slide . [ rumbling ] Nice and easy . [ grunting ] Easy , easy . [ rumbling ] Come on ! [ rumbling ] [ growls ] [ rumbling ] Ooh . [ coughing ] [ panting ] [ creature roaring ] [ rumbling ] Matt is outside . - It 's definitely down . - It 's coming . Well , it 's not gonna get in here . I watched it carry off a horse , okay . If it wants to get in here , it will . What are you doing ? - I 'm looking for documentation . - What for ? For the bunker . How to get the door open . We don 't want it open . Keep it closed . - Dad and Dana are outside . - Listen to me . Okay , rushing out is not gonna help . Okay , Dad probably found Dana , and now they 're hiding , like the smart thing to do . Matt , get away from the God damn door ! - Dad said to work together . - And we will find them . [ clanging ] You listen to me . Matt ! [ grunts ] - What the hell ? - Stop reacting . Start thinking . [ creature roars ] [ rumbling ] God damn it ! [ groans , panting ] [ groans ] [ clanging ] Hello ? Hey ! Flashlight , do you hear me ? - I 'm here ! - Oh , thank God . Can you move ? Yeah , I think you 're below me . - I can try to come down there ... - But don 't , no . God you don 't ... It 'll trigger a slide . - Understood . - Okay . Who are you ? Bailor . Colin Bailor . I was up on the mountain . We knew there 'd been increased seismic activity , - but we weren 't ... - Colin , shut up . Okay . Look around you . What is the terrain ? There 's a ledge . Rocks are ... it looks stable . - I 'm not going anywhere . - All right , I 'm coming to you . [ chuckles ] You wouldn 't happen to have a rope would you ? Today 's your lucky day . [ chuckles ] Okay . Secure the other end . Already done . Great . Hang on , dude . [ grunting ] Hanging on . [ grunting ] Ohh ! [ grunting ] - Hold on . - You can do it ! You can do it ! [ both grunting ] What are you , a weakling piece of shit ? - Get me up ! - Come on ! - Get me up ! - Pull ! - Come on . You can ! - I can 't do it ! I can 't do it ! You got it ! Yes , yes . Oh , oh . [ both panting ] [ gun cocks ] Wha ... Ugh ! You made it . - Who are you ? - I 'm a volcanologist . I was studying Rainier . In the middle of the Apocalypse ? Volcanoes are pretty apocalyptic in general . I must have slid . I don 't know how far . I don 't know . How 'd you end up here ? None of your business . - Open your mouth . - What ? - Open your mouth . - [ grunts ] Let me see under your tongue . Eh . Sorry to do that . Okay . I think I can get us out . I know the caves . Deal ? You and me ? [ breathing shakily ] [ wind howling ] [ creature roars ] - Okay . Keep the mask on . - No . Don 't . There 's no ash coming in here , and I may die if I keep it on . It 's too close . It 's too close . It 's too close . [ creature roaring ] No , it 's in trouble . I don 't think it cares much about us right now . [ roaring ] Breathe in . Yeah , steady . Nice and steady . There you go . All right . I want you to put the mask back on , okay ? No . I swallowed some ash . I feel like I 'm gonna throw up . [ whimpers ] Throwing up 's not the worst thing . Let it out . [ coughing ] [ roaring ] It 's moving away . - No , it 's dying . - Good . Even better . [ creature roaring ] Okay . Let 's put the masks on . Come on . - No . - Come on . No . [ crying ] [ ominous music ] # # We 're gonna start a fire . We 're gonna what ? We 're gonna start a fire , to deplete the oxygen , and then the door will open . Yeah , and open it to a monster outside . Have you completely lost your shit ? You said to think . I 'm thinking . Matt , don 't light anything on fire . Nice . Dick move . Bree , if we don 't go outside , Dad and Dana die quick , and we probably die slow . Just trust me . So the fire sucks all the oxygen and that makes the door open ? Let 's hope so . This is some desperate shit . It 'll work . - We can 't leave them out there . - Yeah . We were checking our instruments on this face . We flipped a coin . I could have just as easily been on the western slope . - Who is " we ? " - There was a group of us . I don 't know what happened to the others . Francine and I dove in when the lahar hit . Oh . Oh , my God . That 's Francine . - I 'm sorry . - She was a good woman . She 's a passable scientist , but a great girl . - She deserved better . - Yeah . So do we . - So what happened ? - We must have fell . I don 't know how far . Rainier ... it has a lot of ice , and the eruption must have melted it and mixed it with ash , and I think that 's what 's sealing us in , but it 's also what 's keeping us alive . - How ? - Well , oxygen passes through water . Plus , the ice that hasn 't melted is keeping the temperature in here down . - How do we get out ? - There 's an extensive cave system through the southeastern slope . I think we have to go further in . Find another passage out . We 're blocked at this elevation . I 'm not liking the sound of that plan . The map 's up here . I mean ... ah ! - What happened to your leg ? - Broke it when I fell . - Your leg is broken ? - It 's definitely broken . So you 're not walking out of here ? Not fast , no . Don 't leave me here , okay ? Shit . Don 't abandon me . - I 'm not gonna abandon you . - Okay . - Nobody gets left behind . - Okay . Matt , why can 't I breathe ? The fire 's eating up the oxygen . Shit . Science sucks . [ both panting ] I 'm an idiot . Tell me about ... the Bowie concert ... - What ? - You went to with Ollie . He played the ... The one with " He tore your dress . " " Rebel , Rebel . " What else ? Uh ... There was , uh , Ziggy ... " Heroes . " The bass player played the part with him . Pressure . [ alarm sounds ] [ door unlocks ] [ both coughing ] Go , Matt , go ! [ roars ] [ gun cocks ] [ ominous music ] # # Oh , my God , I hate these things . Don 't touch it ! Oh , my God . Come on . - It 's fine . Come on . - Just leave it . Dana ! - The volcano calmed down . - Dad ! - Dana ! - Dana ! God , I hope the road 's okay . Right here . [ coughing ] - Oh , my God ! Dana ! - Help him . You got ... You got to help him . It 's okay . I got him . I got him . # # - Can you breathe ? Are you okay ? - [ coughing ] - Yeah . - Dad ! Dad , can you hear me ? Can you stand up ? - [ groans ] - You all right ? - You good on your feet ? - I 've been better , but yeah . - I 'm good . - It 's over , huh ? Yeah . - The Q bird is dead . - The what ? The Q thing . The ... The Quetzalcoatl ? Yes , yes . - Bree , get her inside . - Come on . We have to find the keys first . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . # # [ sniffs ] [ chuckles ] It 's prehistoric . From another place . Where did it come from ? I don 't know . We were inside . - There to the west ? - I guess . Look , Brianna was freaking out . I was trying to take care of that . - It died facing due east . - I don 't know . What does any of this matter ? No animal that flies would ever land in a tailwind . It chose to land due east . [ rumbling ] Hang in there . Sorry . He needs this more than you . - Okay . Where is it ? - It 's in the-yeah . - Okay . - Oh , yes . I 'm gonna need this . All right . Hold this . - Yeah . - All right ? Good . Okay . You got it ? Oh , yeah . You ever had morphine ? You 're in for a treat . - Okay . - My sister taught me how to do this . [ breathing shakily ] Here we go . Here we go . [ shudders ] - Okay . - Right here . - Yeah . - Big breath . [ inhales , exhales deeply ] Nice and easy . Nice and easy . [ groaning ] Here we go . Here we go . Oh , yeah . Ohh . Ahh . Now we can put a splint on that leg , and it won 't hurt . Stick with me . Stick with me . - Yeah , yeah . - [ groaning ] Enjoy it , but don 't pass out . Here we go . Ohh . That was the easy part . Ooh ahh . Shh , shh . Shh , shh . [ groaning ] - Ready now ? - Yeah . [ bone pops ] [ screams ] [ whimpering ] Yeah . Yeah , baby . Okay ? Take a breath . [ breathing quickly ] One more turn . [ bone cracks ] - [ screams ] - It 's on . It 's on . - [ whimpering ] - First one 's done . First one ? How are you feeling ? I 'm trying not to think about silicosis . You get it from volcanic ash , and it 's like breathing in glass . Yeah , well , it sounds like you have to take a long time to get sick , so you were only outside for 40 minutes . You 're fine . - Had a dream about her . - Who ? Mom on the volcano . She 's still alive , Bree . I 'm gonna wet this . - Did you hear me ? - You should sleep , Dana . - Brianna ... - Stop . Stop talking . She survived inside a cave in the volcano , and she 's trying to get back to us . Don 't make it harder . - What ? - Dana , it blew up . You ... You don 't ... you don 't survive that . - No one survives that . - Well , you don 't know . She could ... You don 't know ! Don 't do that . - Do what ? - Dana thing . I am barely keeping my shit together . Barely , and you 're doing that thing . As long as there 's hope , we don 't give up on each other . She 's gone . She went up a mountain , and I can 't even tell you why . But what if she saved us ? It blew up . Dana , the mountain blew up . She 's gone ! But we survived . What if that 's what she wished for on the prayer wheel thing ? There 's still hope . Dana , hope is not a plan . Hope is bullshit . So enough . Mom 's gone . You know , when you were taken by a skinwalker I knew you were still alive too . [ grunting ] - Come on ! - No . No , no , no . Stop , stop , stop , stop . Stop , stop . This is impossible . No . [ both panting ] - Come on . Come on . - No , no , no , no . Don 't leave me . Don 't leave me . Just give me a second . You 're not exactly a ballerina . I 'm sorry . It 's gonna be faster if I go alone . - I 'll circle back around . - No , it 's hopeless . I don 't do " hopeless . " No , no , no . No , no , no . Please don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Come on , kid . You 're gonna bring the mountain down on us . Don 't leave me ! Please ! [ breathing hard ] [ grunts ] Aah ! Bailor ! There 's a way out . [ rumbling ] [ rocks tumbling ] [ crashing ] [ rumbling ] [ stifled crying ] [ sniffles ] - What ? - Nothing . - Dana , you 're crying . - I don 't cry . You know that . - Bengt Larsen . - Who ? Grade nine . Goofy Danish kid . - Oh , my God . - No . I went to one movie with him , and you cried in the shower for a whole week . - But you knew I liked him . - Doesn 't matter . Dana , you cried for Bengt . It is okay to cry for Mom . I 'm not crying for Mom . She 's alive . I 'm crying for Martin , okay ? So leave me alone . - Don 't do that . Stop . - Why ? It is taking everything I have every day to not cry for Devyn . Okay , we are too young for this . We 're 16 years old and people have died for us . That 's not right . We 're like widows . [ scoffs ] We 're not widows . Actually I spoke too soon . We are widows . I know . And I think we 're 17 , not 16 . - Our birthday was last week . - You serious ? I can 't keep track anymore . I don 't know what 's going on . I-I think there 's something wrong with time . When were you taken by the skinwalker ? I don 't know . Like , three months ago ? Right . I think it was ten days , but even I 'm not sure . Devyn knew you for a week , and he died rather than hurt you . Martin knew me for three days , but we would have spent the rest of our lives together . It was all real , but it happened in so much less time than usual that I think something is wrong . - With time ? - Yes . I don 't get it . What is this telling you ? I have no idea . I don 't understand why it 's so important to be smart . You have no answers . At least I haven 't thought about Martin in two minutes . It 's more than I get with Devyn . It 's progress I guess . - Brianna ? - Coming . Hey , Brianna , turn that over . Try that . [ engine grinding , turns over ] Not bad . - Okay , let 's go . - Pack it up . Let 's go . [ ominous music ] [ panting ] I told you , you couldn 't get out of here . Stupid soldier . [ laughs ] - I came back didn 't I ? - Yeah . You did , but it doesn 't matter , 'cause we 're gonna die here . - We 're not gonna die . - Yeah , we are . - We 're not gonna die ! - We 're gonna die here ! - We 're not gonna die ! - Yes , we will ! - Bailor ! - You killed her ! - We 're gonna die ! - Don 't make me die ! I don 't want to die ! I want to be with ... You ought to get right with God . - I want to see my family ! - We will die . We 're gonna die . - Ah ! - You 'll never see them . Never see them again . It 's the end , Karen . [ laughing ] And you know what ? I 'm good with it . I 'm good with it . 'Cause neither of us are coming off of this mountain ! [ rumbling , rocks crumbling ] [ grunts ] Soldier . You 're a soldier . [ laughing ] Dana , we 're getting out of here . - I need to show you something . - What ? Science ? 'Cause I don 't like science . Mom took a locator up the mountain with her , and I just turned the receiver on . - Do you know where that is ? - Yeah . It 's , um ... What , Dana ? It 's on the other side of the mountain about a quarter-mile up . There 's glaciers there which would keep it cool and give her water , and her position is on a known series of caves . So she could have survived ? I don 't know , but it 's worth going back to find out . - What 's going on ? - Dana thinks that ... - Based on Mom 's last position ... - That she could be alive , and I agree with her . We have to go look . - The volcano is still active . - So ? I can 't take you back into danger to look for her . She 'd kill me . Well , you came back out to save me . What would she think about that ? She 'd expect nothing less . There 's your answer . - Oh . - So we 're going back . - Shotgun . - Both : Shotgun . - Don 't push . - Shove over . [ Bailor laughing ] What are you looking for ? - Meaning . - [ laughing ] It 's so hot . It 's like the sun in here . I 'm sorry if the active volcano is making you feel uncomfortable . - You 're a mean drunk . - It 's not me . That 's the morphine talking , and it 's doing just fine ! [ echoes ] Making you feel uncomfortable . [ water running ] [ ominous music ] # # [ laughter echoing eerily ] - All right . - What 's that ? Huh ? The family bird ? [ screeching ] [ gasps ] You can stop that anytime you want . [ laughter echoing eerily ] Hey , not everything 's about you . You . [ laughter echoing eerily ] Stop it ! Don 't you recognize me ? You 'd think you 'd remember . You took Dana . You took my daughter . [ laughter echoing eerily ] You remember now ! I killed you ! Yes , you did . [ laughter echoing eerily ] You threatened my daughter . I never saw your girl . You killed me anyway . I did what I had to do . I have something for you . Here . Take it . It 's your bullet . The one you blew into my back . I didn 't kill anybody ! I didn 't kill anybody ! Bitch . [ laughing ] It 's still hot when it hits you . You know that ? It 's still hot . It pulverizes , burns away skin , and then comes the trauma . Take back your bullet . I knew my spine was shattered . Flesh and bone , together . And the last thing was the fall . It 's time to accept your fate . Stop it . Killer . Selfish . Demon . It 's time to accept your fate . [ laughing ] Stop it . Stop it . Killer . [ laughing ] [ laughter continues ] [ laughter stops ] [ rocks clinking ] Okay . I can 't change everything . I accept it . Mom ! Mom ! [ indistinct shouting ] Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Dad , I see her ! Mom ! Mom , it 's okay . We 're coming . Mom , we 're coming . Don 't worry ! We 're coming . It 's okay , Mom , we 're coming . [ quietly chuckles ] Be careful . Thank God you found me . Dana found you , Mom . She used the ... She knew . Of course you knew . Of course you knew . - What 's this ? - Oh . Mom , what is that ? I 'll explain it to you someday . Okay . Well , we should get some water in you . - Yeah . - You got to eat , Mom . I know . I know . Let 's just go home , okay ? - Can we go home , please ? - Right . - We can go home . - Yeah . - Yeah , yeah . - Yes , we are . We 're gonna go home , but we 're gonna catch up - for five minutes first . - Okay . Um ... - how did you survive ? - Matt almost killed me . - Yeah , except I saved you . - And then Dad saved me . - And then Dana saved you . - Yeah , but then who was arguing with Dana and it made her figure out where Mom was , so technically I saved you . Well , thank you . So what happened with that ... that monk person ? - Was he ... Was he real ? - I don 't know . I don 't know , honestly . The prayer wheel is definitely real . - It killed Jane . - Oh , my God . I don 't know . Somehow she was relieved . - And the monk ? - [ sighs ] I 'm glad I met him . [ chuckles ] Where 's Martin ? Oh , honey . Oh , my girl . I 'm so sorry . [ crying ] - How 's it looking ? - No ash . Wind must have blown it north of here . So then the farm 's not wrecked ? - We get it back ? - It looks that way . [ exhales sharply ] Matt , we 're going home . Oh , my God . Do you know how many nights I dreamed about this ? - All of ' em . - Every single one . I swear to you I am never leaving home again . I think you might get bored . Yeah , well ... me and Devyn used to talk about it , right ? And , um , he knew everything about farming . And I mean , like , everything . He would have come and lived with us , and he would farm like crazy . Like , he would have loved it . Totally . - And you 're gonna help ? - Okay . - Don 't make it sound stupid . - I 'm not . Look , people change . I changed . No , you didn 't . Not to me . It 's all right . I was ready to be myself . You were always yourself . I don 't ... I never would have thought that I could kill people , Matt . And you know what ? It was easy . Okay , I wasn 't wrong . It was just ... it was ... It was one more thing . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry about Dev . I know . But , hey , I was ... I was willing to change , so maybe Dana can be the new wild one . Now , that will be the sign of the Apocalypse . [ laughs ] Yeah . Dana with eyeliner . Could you imagine ? End times , huh ? - He was a good guy . - Martin ? - He was an Army Ranger . - What 's that ? It 's about the best thing you can be when you 're in the Army . - So it 's good ? - Are you kidding ? It 's fantastic . Well , she earned him . She 's fantastic . Have you noticed it 's the end of the world , and you can 't buy a date ? Have you noticed that you 're alive , and maybe you 'd like to stay that way ? Matt , we 're home . Well , that 's not what we hoped . - Yeah . - Oh , my God . I 'm gonna go wake up your mother . God , what is that smell ? Is that salt ? Somebody salted our farm . Every single plant is uprooted . It 's like they used a tractor . - We 'll replant . - It reeks of salt . Nothing 's gonna grow here for years . Someone put a lot of effort into this . - Yeah , like Feverheads . - Who else has the energy ? - [ groans ] - I spent so much time trying to get away from this place . I 'm so sorry , Mom . [ crying ] My farm ! My farm ! - Get the shotgun . - Happy to . [ screaming ] Hey , that 's Rob Halderson . [ shotgun cocks ] And Corinne . Forget the shotgun . Corinne . Karen , I 'm so sorry . They burned our farm four days ago . - Who ? Who did ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . We ran away . [ Rob indistinctly screaming ] Rob already had the blood in his mouth ... And when ... when we came back he 'd burned our house , and killed all the cattle , and it was just ... It was such a shock that he went bad right away . [ screaming ] - I 'm sorry . - He went bad right away . - Sorry . - He kept saying , " I 'm gonna get even with them . I 'm gonna get even with them . " - Oh , so he did all this , huh ? - It 's the fever . He would have killed me if I tried to stop him . Honey , he 's gonna kill you anyway . You know how to use this ? [ Rob grunting ] Yes . Take it . You 're gonna need to . You be careful . - Let 's get out of here . - What are you doing ? - We 're leaving ? - Yeah . Yeah we are . Yeah , what are you , crazy ? That 's our home . What 's your plan ? I figure out that I love this place , and you 're taking it away ? Look , I 'm kind of a slow learner , but when I get something I get it . Everything here belongs to the past . It 's not ours . - [ screams ] - [ whimpers ] The only thing we have for ourselves is tomorrow . So that 's where we 're gonna go . [ Rob screaming ] Okay . [ Rob screaming continues ] - Saddle up . - Yeah . - Where we going ? - I don 't know . You know ... in the cave there were drawings on the wall . Some of them looked like they were our family , but there was one of ... Like that Q bird ... Quetzalcoatl . What was it doing ? It was ... It was flying toward a red sun . Red sun . That 's a Chinese ideogram . Means dawn or east . - Okay . - Which is interesting because during the eruption Matt and Brianna ... This Quetzalcoatl landed near them and it was deliberately facing to the east . Facing the east . So maybe they 're not demons ? They never attacked us . They 've only taken animals for food . So maybe they 're working for us . Harbingers ? You think it 's sexy when you use big words ? - No , " harbinger " just ... - I know . It foresha ... Foreshadowing ... I know what a harbinger is . [ creature roars ] [ dramatic music ] # # - Should we follow it ? - I 'll go wherever you go . Come on . What 's that ? I don 't know . Used to be a bullet . Now it 's a stone . [ gun shot ] [ roars ]

[ man shouts indistinctly ] [ laughter and applause ] Very good . Throw him out . Throw him out . [ laughter ] Words that kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet 's thoughts . But it was too late to go back now . It was as if she were riding a giant ... COCK ! [ laughter ] I have " tidal wave , " but cock is better . [ laughter ] [ cheers and applause ] It would be folly to fight against it . Her only chance would be to ride it out , adapt , and perhaps ... SWALLOW ! ... Survive . [ laughter ] Thank you . [ cheers and applause ] Oh , It 's you ! Look , I 'm trying to hide from my creator and his minion . They scare me . I feel all is not well here . I 've been thinking a lot about ... Sex ! Eddie . I have a feeling of foreboding . It 's all like some terrible dream . A WET DREAM ! [ laughter ] Is it true you don 't like men with too many muscles ? Well , uh , I 'm engaged to Brad . Just the same as Betty Munroe was to Ralph Hapschatt . But Frank 's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstasy I 'd never dreamed of before . Hot , burning kisses . I could see Brad 's face before me , and my mind screamed no , but my lips were hungry . [ laughter ] Too hungry . I wanted to be loved , and loved completely . My body throbbed excitedly . Oh , Brad . Brad , my darling , how could I have done this to you ? This room is a womb to me . A WOMB WITH A VIEW ! [ laughter ] Yes. there , you see ? It 's instinctive . You returned here for one thing and one thing only . SEX ! Security . Oh , where 's Brad ? What have they done with him ? [ blips ] Janet 's feelings ran wild ... [ cheers and applause ] as she frantically manipulated the selector switch on the TV monitor . The screens threw up images of empty rooms and corridors . Finally , she stopped - - at Frank 's bedroom . Oh ! You can 't rely on anyone . Oh , Brad ! How could you ? !

As does this setup you have here . I didn 't expect it to be quite so ... Sophisticated , Dr. Scott ... or should i say Dr. von Scott ? [ German accent ] They never proved nothing ! What exactly are you implying ? That 's all right , Brad . Ah , what exotic container you have there ? What do you think it is , Doc ? [ bleep ] . At this precise moment , it 's hard to tell .

When they have pulled themselves together , see to it that they are prepared for the floor show . My God ! I can 't take any more of this . First you ditch me for Eddie , and then you throw him off like an old overcoat for Rocky ! You chew people up , and then you spit them out again . I loved you ! Do you hear ? I loved you . and what did I get ? [ scoffs ] [ laughter ] I 'll tell you . A big fat nothing ! You 're like a sponge - - you take , take , take , and drain others of their affections .

[ Transylvanian accent ] When will we return to Transylvania ? I grow weary of this world . [ Transylvanian accent ] Magenta ... I am indeed grateful ... to both you and your brother , Riff Raff . You have both served me well . Loyalty such as yours ... must be rewarded . And you will discover that , when the mood takes me , I can be quite generous . I ask for nothing ! [ laughs ] [ mockingly ] Master . And you shall receive it ... in abundance ! [ growls ] Mmmmmm ! Ohhhh ! Ohhhh ! [ Riff Raff laughing ] [ cheers and applause ] And so , by some extraordinary coincidence , fate , it seems , had decided that Brad and Janet should keep their appointment with their friend , Dr. Everett Scott . SIEG HEIL ! Gesundheit . But it was to be in a situation which none of them could possibly have foreseen . And just a few hours after announcing their engagement , Brad and Janet had both tasted ... FRANK 'S COCK ! I 'm sure it would rattle in your mouth , dear . ... forbidden fruit . This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals and some persuasion . What further indignities were they to be subjected to ? [ man shouts indistinctly ] [ laughs derisively ] [ laughter and applause ] And what of the sonic transducer ? And the floor show that had been spoken of ? What indeed ? From what had gone before , it was clear that this was to be ... A PICNIC ? I forgot my thermals . ... no picnic .

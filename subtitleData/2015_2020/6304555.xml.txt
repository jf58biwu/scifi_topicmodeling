 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a lifelike android . Mom ? He has become the prototype for a new breed Of thinking machines called humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms Now hold the key to earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species That have ever existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on extant ... That 's john woods ' car . He leaves humanichs , His car stops on the train tracks ... ( train horn blaring ) unlock this door ! What do you know about taylor ? Shepherd : A threat assessment computer Calderon and john created way back . John knew I had a way to shut taylor down . Taylor decided to stop him . Taylor killed my husband ? Taalr : Perhaps it 's time you told the public About the hybrid invasion . But there aren 't enough national guardsmen to maintain control . Taalr : You have humanichs . If it is the end of the world , maybe we should Enjoy the time we have left , Even if it is for just one night . Ethan told me about your legs . ( gasps ) Lucy told shepherd that she was answering To a higher authority . We need to find out where Those orders are coming from . Lucy : You were playing me . That 's okay . I hid julie ; your turn to find her . Help me ! ( muffled screaming ) Molly : The kill switch is the amulet . Calderon : It is . Molly : This is the amulet That I was holding in my dream When I tried to kill you . Just let me do it . Molly . No . We 're gonna use it . No matter what happens . Woman : You are aware of the gravity of the situation ? Yes , madam president . We 're doing everything we can . We 've instituted random checkpoints . We have every humanich on the street that 's available to us . We will find molly woods . Just get it done . ( earpiece chimes ) ¶ ¶ Osama bin laden . Do you know who that was ? A terrorist . Of the late 20th and early 21st centuries . Responsible for many attacks , Including those of September 11 , 2001 . He was killed may 2 , 2011 ... Let me stop you right there . He was killed . That mission was accomplished . What are the humanichs doing to accomplish this mission ? There will be 1,000 more online by tomorrow , ma 'am . That 's the kind of initiative I expect from you , lucy . Yes , ma 'am . You 'll be seeing a lot more of that . ( knocking on door ) Julie wouldn 't mind . Ethan : Charlie ? ! Man ( over p.A. ) : Attention . Please cooperate with security forces . They are here for your protection . Pain in the ass , all this security . It 's a crock . You ask me , more people were killed last year By bad eggs than by terrorists . ( chuckles ) : Not my bad eggs . ( chuckles ) Oh ! Honey , are you okay ? You 're bleeding . I got to get you to a hospital . No . You 're dorothy . You knew my father , ahdu . They 're looking for me . Please help me . Okay . Come on , come on , come on . Man ( over p.A. ) : Please cooperate with security forces . ( indistinct radio chatter ) They are here for your protection . ( exhales ) Is he dead ? Richter : No , he 's drunk . Charlie ! ( coughs ) wake up . Charlie . Charlie . Why did you do this ? ( panting ) Julie . ( coughs ) She 's dead . It 's my fault . ( coughs ) Taalr : Nicholas calderon has been captured . Yes , I heard . I believe there 's something in molly woods ' possession That may be of concern . Calderon took something from a safety deposit vault . He risked exposure in order to get it . I believe that he gave it to molly woods . Given both of their agendas , I can only assume That whatever he gave her poses a serious threat to us . What are your recommendations ? I have one that should get the job done . I tried everything to find her . If I 'm responsible for killing the woman I love , How am I supposed to live with that ? Ethan : But it 's still possible That she 's alive . Right ? It 's possible . Richter : Did lucy give you any clues To where julie might be ? Ask you for anything In exchange for her ? ( charlie sniffles ) No . She said my punishment was I would never know what happened to her . She was right . There 's nothing worse . I created lucy . Unleashed this monster on the world . Charlie ... What if you could destroy that monster ? I thought taylor 's prime directive Was to keep humanity safe , Not to destroy us . Well , apparently he got the details Of the mission a little screwed up . An artificial superintelligence Controlling an army Of highly skilled killer robots . It 's every futurist 's nightmare . This is the silver bullet , huh ? Molly : Mm-hmm . Nano-tech . Self-replicating worm . It 'll destroy his hardware . Taylor is way too sophisticated to let you get Close enough to use that . Maybe . Calderon gave us this map of one euclid . That 's where taylor 's main server is . It 's also one of the most secure complexes in the world . What if we just ... Blow up the whole damn building ? That building is the nerve center For the western half of the planet . You 'd take down The entire infrastructure , From streetlights to satellites . The financial markets would close , Planes would lose their nav systems . It 'd be cybergeddon . It 'd have to be a surgical strike . We 'd need a complete power grid shutdown , Long enough to approach taylor while he 's asleep . Asleep ? Response to the grid shutdown . And then , after that , you 'd have maybe 30 seconds To get the job done before you 'd be caught and killed . And you 'd need someone on the inside . So you 're saying there is a way to do this . I 'm saying there 's no way for this to happen Without somebody being killed . ( door opens ) Corrine : Madam secretary ? You have a visitor . They found him wandering outside the gates . Said he needed to talk to you , that it was urgent . Ethan . What 's going on ? There isn 't much time . Lucy : Time for what ? Hey , little brother . I 've missed you . I missed you , too . A visit from a special boy Like you deserves a special treat . Oh . I 'll join you . Not necessary . We 're just gonna go for some ice cream , lucy . Go outside , ethan . I 'll be right back . Be sure to tap any sort of communication . ( door beeps ) He 's in . They swooped him up outside the gsc . If anything happens to him , charlie ... Oh , no , don 't worry about ethan . He 's smarter than all of us put together . ( phone ringing ) Dorothy ? All right , stay put . I 'm on my way . What happened ? Dorothy 's got terra . I 'm gonna bring them in . This little light comes on , they 're engaged . Okay . This is an encrypted chat room , right ? No one can intercept the communication . But don 't stay more than 45 seconds . After that , even with a code scramble , They can trace your location . ( beeping ) They 're traveling . You okay ? I had it pictured . Right down to the white picket fence and the golden retriever . What good is saving the world If the people you love aren 't in it ? Molly , what if she 's already dead ? Charlie . When I trained to go to space , They told me , " don 't think about if you don 't come home . Think about what you 'll do when you get there . " Okay ? Okay . They 're in position . I 'm going for ethan . Remember , no more than 45 seconds . Got it . Fiona : These are some very serious things You 're saying here , ethan . I know . And molly sent you to tell me all of this ? Where is she ? I can 't tell you . Not until I know we have a deal . How will you know ? In movies , they shake hands . And if the person has honor , which I think you do , Then the deal is sealed and they can trust each other . Okay , you can talk to her now . Where is she ? Here . Hello , fiona . I 'm sure by now ethan has told you Everything about taylor and the humanichs program . And that taylor killed general shepherd . Yes . Why should I believe any of this nonsense ? Because it 's the truth . Toby was killed by A gsc-issued drone , Not the hybrids . And I 'm supposed to just Take your word for it ? Every drone has a transponder code . Check the flight log . Madam secretary , you have the wrong enemy . We have contact with a vr trans . Location . Vr trace , 30 seconds . How can you suggest that hybrids aren 't dangerous to humans ? Because hybrids want peace . Taylor ginned up this whole threat Just to create demand for humanichs . Now he 's got killing squads roaming the streets , And thousands more to come . Now , we can shut taylor down . With the fail-safe that john and calderon created In the event that he exceeded his limits . But we can 't do that without your help . Man : Madam secretary , We have a lock in ten seconds . Fiona : I 'm going to need to take this all the way up To the president . No , you can 't do that . If taylor finds out , it 'll be too late . Five seconds , ma 'am , we 'll have a location . I 'm afraid it 's all up to you . Damn it . What happened ? Tech : Molly woods cut off contact Before we could complete the trace . ( knocking on door ) Oh , my god , terra , wh-what happened ? Humanichs patrol shot her in broad daylight . This is gonna hurt a little bit . ( whimpers ) It 's okay , it 's okay . I 'm here . I-I couldn 't take her to a hospital . It was just too dangerous . Jd had me bring her here . Thank you . Richter : She 's gonna be all right . The bullet just grazed her . You done good , judge . ( door beeps ) How 'd I do ? You did great , honey . The ball 's in fiona 's court now . Julie ... No , it 's terra . She 's gonna be okay . Terra 's alive . Maybe there 's still hope for julie . Yeah , buddy . Maybe . How 's kelsey ? She 's good . She 's starting her second trimester . Kind of reminds me of me . She 's carrying all in front . That 's how I knew I was having a girl . I remember . It was like you had swallowed a beach ball . ( laughs ) Gosh . Dorothy . On the off chance something should happen to me , I want you to know that I took out a life insurance policy . Okay , jd , don 't ... No , please , let me finish . There 's a safe at the cabin , Under the bed , below the floorboards . The combination is our anniversary . Inside , there 's something for both you and kelsey . You 're talking like somebody who thinks they 're gonna die . No . No . It 's just a precaution . Okay . We 'll have 20 model ls up and running by tomorrow . And you got the specs for this new project from taylor ? They just came in . I 've put a team on it . Expedite it . ( whirring ) What did you find out ? Did you check the logs ? There was in fact a drone released The night general shepherd was killed . Who authorized it ? That 's the confusing part , ma 'am . No one . Madam secretary , we have an urgent situation . The virus containment unit has been breached . Is anything missing ? The hn21c strain . That 's the first iteration . I 'm sorry , ma 'am ? This is not the strain of the virus that just kills hybrids . This is the first strain- - the one that kills human beings too . Freeze ! How long you been hiding out in my garage ? About as long as you 've been In hawaii ? ( laughs ) Oh , you can 't be here . You 're , like , a fugitive from justice and such . You trust me ? Yes . And no . Mostly yes . You want in on a fight That might actually be worth fighting ? Is there such a thing ? What would you say if I told you we had a chance To save this godforsaken hellhole of a planet ? I 'd say ... How much does it pay ? I thought you might say that . It 's all I got . The rest goes to kelsey . Oh ... So what are we doing ? It 's really kind of you to help like this . Of course . Molly , I-I 'm so glad to see you back . I mean , when ... When I last saw you ... Yeah . Well ... I was luckier than ahdu . You could go , you know . You-you don 't have to stay . I know , I-I could . I ... ( sighs ) You still love him , don 't you ? Why do you do that ? I mean , pry into my thoughts like that . It 's just cruel . I don 't mean to be cruel , dorothy . I just ... I just want you to go tell him how you feel . It appears madam secretary is no longer Someone who can be trusted . Taalr : Yes , I 'm aware . Fiona stanton checked the drone logs . Would you like her terminated ? Not yet . She 's still useful . We need to keep a low profile while we complete our mission . You 're ready to go operational ? Quite ready . Good . One more thing . Would you mind telling me what you had for breakfast ? Certainly . One euclid- - taylor 's nerve center . On the outside , a nondescript office building . Inside ... More security than fort knox . If we 're smart and very lucky , Here 's how we might get in . First , I 'm gonna hack into the system and make it Look like it 's overheating . That 's where you come in . You 're gonna turn us into a gsc service crew . They put a maintenance call out , we grab it . Government service vehicle , gsc maintenance uniforms , Scannable I.D. They got facial rec ? State of the art . I 'm not worried- - just asking what to pack . Female voice : Lens printing complete . Richter : In through the lobby , and we clear security . There will be more clearances , protocols with the guards . That 's when I reach out to fiona . She 's agreed To shut down the power grid , So the situation at one euclid looks more critical . Richter : Guards get us downstairs To systems control . That 's where all the manual overrides are located . And once the power grid is down , The doors to taylor 's primary server room Can be opened manually . And that 's when terra and I make our move . Okay , how do you get past the guards ? You 're the most wanted woman on the planet . Richter : Let 's just say that molly ... Has her ways . I 'm not gonna ask . You 're gonna have a five-minute window Before his backup system overrides the grid . Okay , so I 'm gonna have about two minutes To reach the port . And release this Into taylor . Charlie : And once the power comes back on , The doors to the maze will close . The only way you 're getting back out is if you succeed . And you 're gonna have to memorize this map . There 's no way you 're gonna have time For directions once you 're in . How do you memorize a maze ? Molly : I don 't know how you do it But I think I just did . Fiona : How is it possible that we have no security footage Of the breach ? Apparently , it was wiped . Fiona : Then who the hell has the virus ? Brasilia , shanghai , Tel aviv , seoul , mumbai , lagos , St. Petersburg . Have a nice flight . Hey . Hey . ( sighs ) : Ooh . These last few weeks have been insane . Yeah , well , that 's one way of putting it . ( chuckles ) Um ... Kelsey 's really looking forward to spending some quality time With you when the baby 's born . Did she say that ? Yes . She did . I 'm looking forward to it , too . Okay , well ... Good . Our daughter needs you , jd . I need you . Dorothy , what the hell ? This is a suicide mission . Ah ... Damn it . Molly put you up to this , didn 't she ? You don 't have to prove anything to anyone . No , she had no right . She loves you , you idiot . Dorothy ... Go home to our daughter ... And her baby . And you take care of them . For both of us . You 're a good man . ( door beeps ) Ares came for me . I 'm sorry I ran out on you . I had no choice . I was worried about you , terra . But I knew you were out there . How are you feeling ? Better . Thanks to dorothy . She 's one of the good ones . They come in all stripes . People . Just like us hybrids . Some of us are compassionate like ahdu . Some of us are angry like ares . And then there 's everything in between . And where is it you think I fall ? Well , you know , You 've done some things with ares That tipped the scales more towards angry than kind . Yes , we 're angry . Things are bad out there and we were trying ... We are trying to survive . Here 's what I think . In the end , it 's kindness and compassion That 'll save us all . Not violence and anger . ( quietly ) : Okay ? I 'm gonna ask you to do something . Something that might balance those scales . What the hell kind of stunt was that ? I 'm trying to remind you That there are people here that love you and need you ! So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me ? Don 't play that game , molly . I 'm not playing games . Now , you believe in that vision Just as much as I do . What if I do ? Then why are you willfully And deliberately marching towards your own death ? When I came back from 2nd k , I can 't tell you how many nights I would wake up in a cold sweat . The nightmares ... I understand that ! No , you don 't ! A soldier recently told me that I walked away From my war , from my men . That wasn 't your war ! Maybe it wasn 't , but this is ! And I want to see it through . ( electronic chirping ) It 's fiona . Something 's happened . You 're gonna have to go right now . Now ? But we 're not ready . Listen to me . An hour ago , a dozen humanichs went off-site . Got on planes with the virus- - the first iteration . The one that kills humans . We have six hours to stop them . They 've overridden nav systems , Shut off contact with the planes . There 's no way to land them . If I give the order to shoot them down , Taylor will be alerted , And god knows what he 'll unleash upon us . Good luck , molly . I 'm sorry to bring you in so late . We have a security drill That we need to run immediately . Based on a scenario where our infrastructure 's been hacked . We need to see how quickly we can run A sensitivity-related shutdown . You want to mimic shutting down the grid ? No , roger , we don 't want to " mimic " anything . You have your instruction . This is the entire state of california . It is . Ethan . You 're very quiet tonight . What if charlie 's right ? What if julie 's really gone ? Where did she go , ethan ? I don 't know . Wherever humans go when they die . My mom 's on a dangerous mission tonight . I don 't know what 's going to happen , richard . I 'm sorry . My fuel cell is low . Going into power save mode now . I 'll go get your charger . Charlie , talk to me . Almost there . The system 's core temperature 's about to reach critical . Genius hack , I must say . All right , I 'm gonna save The applause for later , all right ? Security in the area is not to be notified . Madam secretary , are you sure ? One euclid is in the center of this grid . Do I seem unsure ? ( sighs ) Male voice : Incoming call . Female voice : Please confirm eye-scan for security . Mickey garrett , your identity is verified . All righty . Please stand by to receive work order . ( chimes ) Gsc maintenance , mickey speaking . Well , that 's unusual . I 'll have a guy there in two minutes . Hey , don 't you touch nothing . It 's a good thing you didn 't choose a life of crime . The night 's young , jd . ( chuckles ) The night 's young . Let 's do this . You 're gonna be great . You read my mind ? I don 't have to . Ma 'am . Richter : Gsc maintenance . You got a problem with your cooling system . We need to get into systems control . Okay , mr . Dalton . And mr . Garrett . Your escort will be here within two minutes . You wait two minutes , And every server in this building is gonna be trash . Now . Ray : So come on , bro , don 't be the bureaucrat That accidentally took down the entire western seaboard . Make a decision . There go the lights . You ready ? Okay . Ray : Ticktock , ticktock . Got to move fast . What the hell just happened ? I don 't know , we didn 't do anything . Uh , there was a backup somewhere that we were unaware of . ( alarm blares ) We need to abort . Now . Go , go , go . Move ! ( guns fire ) ( panting ) ( gunfire continues ) Okay , all right , we got this . Just a couple guys . Piece of cake . You go left , I go right ? On three ? On three . One ... Aah ! Oh ! That 's not gonna work . Yeah , no kidding . ( gunfire stops ) Why aren 't they firing ? Ray : What the hell ? It 's okay , let 's go , go , come on . Hold on . Man : Take them out ! ( man shouts ) What the hell just happened back there ? ( sighs ) I 'll explain it later . Fiona , if you can hear me , You 've got to call the president . Shoot those planes down . Hello , molly . Fiona 's been detained . She asked me to step in and tell you There 's been a change of plans . He knows . Taylor knows . Fiona : Yes , madam president , everything 's under control . The threat has been contained , ma 'am . There 's no further cause for concern . We have four hours to get into one euclid . Can 't be done . We just saw that . There 's no way to get around taylor . Maybe there 's a way . Jd . ( grunts ) Pull over . Terra , we have to find ares . No , no , no , that 's not happening , all right ? Ares isn 't gonna help you . He 's here ... Somewhere . He 's close , I can feel it . Okay , now look , if you come with me , You know he 's not gonna help us . Damn it , molly . One hour . You have one hour , and then you meet me back at julie 's . Okay . One hour . Come on , terra . Ray : So , aliens ... Hybrids , robots . Man , what-what are you into ? I told you it was a lot . And it 's about to get a whole lot weirder , So if you want to bail out , pull the rip cord , No hard feelings . ( sighs ) I mean , the last thing a guy like me needs Is an all-knowing supercomputer up my ass . And this alien thing , I ... Well , I-I don 't know what to say about that . I 'm sorry I dragged you into it . I 'm sorry it didn 't work out . Hey , I was due for a reboot . Here . No , man . Keep it . Consider it a parting gift . Garage is yours . God help us all . Good luck . I 'm sorry , buddy . It 's over . No , it 's not . What is this ? It 's julie . What do you mean ? Julie 's charging station . It constantly tracks the location of her legs . That 's how she gets automatic software updates . I don 't know if she 's alive , but she 's at the humanichs lab . Of course . Why didn 't I think of this ? You 're amazing . Come on . We 've done the final defense response patch . We 've simulated a more extreme adrenal push . We 're ready ? Absolutely . ( electric buzzing ) Hello , molly . Welcome to the world . Ray 's out . You all right ? Where 's terra ? The humanichs got her . They almost got me , too . Fiona 's dead , so ... Looks like we 're back to square one . No , we ... What about the amulet ? The nanobots from-from calderon . Uh , we can still get those into taylor . The amulet . Don 't you have it ? Are you joking ? Molly , you have it . Oh . Guess I do . Molly . ( groans ) Why did you do this ? So that we would win .

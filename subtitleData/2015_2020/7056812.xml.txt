 You 've disobeyed us , Jarli . You must leave . Now ! They 're gonna fit you with a security tag . I 'll take you home . ( GUNSHOTS ) You 'll wonder what all the fuss was about . ( GRUNTS ) Oh ! You don 't get to decide who lives or dies , Harry ! But if we want to live side by side , everyone accepting everyone else , well , then , we have to find another way . Shut your initiative down , Waruu , or I 'll do it for you . ( GRUNTS ) Argh ! He was going to , um hurt the baby . He wanted to ... He wanted to take it out of me . I think we better call the police . No , no , wait , wait , wait . Um ... You 're not gonna tell them , are you ? Perhaps we could come up with a story or ... Oh , God , I 'm sorry . Why did he want to remove your child ? I don 't know . I think maybe he didn 't trust me . Why not ? Why did you let him drag you into all this mess ? Mm ? Let you be the face of the initiative ? After all that work you did in the Zone , Waruu . What good did that do ? The initiative 's the only way I could see to save the Hairies . Well , he isn 't going ... He wasn 't going to save anyone . Is your child a Hairy ? Makes sense . All the experimenting he 's been doing . He didn 't tell you , did he ? You 're not gonna tell anyone , are you ? Don 't worry . I won 't tell a soul . You can trust me . All that time we worked together in the Zone . Yeah . But you should go . Ooh ... Oh ... ( GASPS ) So ... what now ? Still gotta sort out my brother , see if he 's come to his senses . I might leave you to that . Probably best if you go to the others . I 'll go get the van first . The clinic will be crawling with security . - Just stay out of trouble . - Bit late for that . Jarli . Jarli ! You wanna find your mother ? My mother ? - I 'll go tell my father . - Can 't tell no-one . They 'll stop us . I 'll find your mother . And everyone else they locked up . You with me ? KOEN : Waruu ! Waruu ! ALINTA : You 're alive . He 's not here . - Where 's your mum ? - I 'll show you . And you reckon this CA fella Dolan will help me ? I don 't know . - Where 's Latani ? - They separated us . Come on . You 're coming with me . It goes off if I step outside the house . He 's holding you here ? Well , then we smash it off . That 'll set off the alarm too . I 'm not leaving you here with him . Go find Mum . When you 're all together , you can work out what to do . MARIAN : You said you 'd deal with him . Government facilities have been destroyed . News crews are camped outside the building . I take full responsibility . We look weak ! Out of control ! We look like we don 't know what we 're doing ! I 'll find him , neutralise him , or I 'll resign . These are just words . What have you actually done about this ? I 'm working on a number of leads . You 're a born politician . You know , there 's more spin in you than there is in the rest of us put together . I will find him . There 's a girl with him . I haven 't seen her before , in any of our footage . Who is she ? Audrey Martin . No criminal record . And her whereabouts ? No fixed address . I put out an urgent call to locate her . We should let the staff at the clinic know to keep an eye out in case she returns . Oh , we 're not reopening the clinic . Replacing the equipment will be simple enough . A couple of days at most . I visited the clinic . And I saw no monsters . Exactly . That 's what the initiative does ... makes them like us so that we feel as you do now . At the clinic , were you under attack ? Were they in full flight , razor-sharp fingernails out , faster and more powerful than anything you could imagine ? Were they wanting to rip your heart out , Marian ? Of course not . Then you have not seen a Hairy . MAN : Mr West ! Mr West , could you comment , please ? ( JOURNALISTS SHOUT OVER ONE ANOTHER ) Following this cowardly attack on the inclusion clinic , the Department of Human Safety today declares that inclusion will now be compulsory for all subhumans . We will not be intimidated by terrorist activities from Hairy sympathisers . We will not change who we are or how we live . Any subhuman found will be arrested and escorted by armed guard to the clinic . To further protect our citizens , Bennelong House will now be under 24-hour guard . No residents of Bennelong House will be permitted to leave the premises for any reason whatsoever . I will not be taking any questions . Thank you . MAN : What do you mean , you 're not taking any questions ? ( JOURNALISTS SHOUT OVER ONE ANOTHER ) WOMAN : Mr West ? Mr West ? But Linda 's there , yeah ? Yeah , she 's fine . Keeping everyone in line . We need blankets , though . - That hallway cupboard . - Sure . - How many are there altogether ? - About 20 of us . Shit . Is that all ? Yeah . We need to get Linta out of Waruu 's place . Dolan says he 's hacking the system , deactivating the tag . Do you trust him ? But if he can get the tag off ... Well , let 's go . POLICE RADIO : 1-3 in progress . Request immediate assistance . MAN : Copy that . Travelling . Over . COMPUTERISED VOICE : Enter secure ID . Officer Hendricks . Secure ID confirmed .

( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ON POLICE RADIO ) ( SIREN WAILS ) You 're giving alcohol to kids now ? Just treating you like an adult . You know , I saw footage of the attack on the CA vans . I don 't know how you survived . You left us for dead . They were gonna kill us . And you just left . You 're right . Is this where you say you 're going to make it all better ? Nah , I can 't make it better . Truth is , I screwed up . ( PHONE VIBRATES ) But I found you , and I got them to release you to me , and now you 're here . So when you 're done being angry with me , you might want to think about what happens next . - That tag hurting you , bub ? - No . - Are you sure ? - It 's fine . Yep . It 's not always going to be like this . It 's ' cause I 'm in the government now . You could be a target . You need protection . We 're a family ... you , your mum , me . I know that 's not what you want to hear . That 's how it is . I was so scared . Of course you were . I didn 't know where you 'd gone . Why you 'd left . I know . But I 'm here now .

Alinta , I 've got to go to the office . Alinta . I want to know why my daughter 's security tag has malfunctioned and where the hell she is . Mr West , the system notified us of a problem with the device . We reactivated the tracking function . - That 's her . - Where is that ? 25 Miller Street , Jubilee . Send a CA crew to pick her up . Um ... What ? It 's the home of a CA officer . MAN : ( SHOUTS ) Going in ! Check the edges . Nerida , Alinta . - What the hell ? - Dad ? - ( MEN SHOUT IN THE BACKGROUND ) - MAN : Clear ! This is cosy , isn 't it ? You 've been harbouring Hairy sympathisers , did you realise ? Dangerous fugitives . Serious penalties for that , especially for a CA man . Just leave him alone . You should have thought about that before you muscled your way in on my family . Get him out of here . Gonna be a hero , Tim ? Come on . Let 's go . You know , they 're not the enemy , you are . - Keep it going ! - Move ! Move ! - What do you want ? - You .

( SCREAMS ) - I want him alive . - That might not be possible . - We need to question him . - Hesitate and you 'll be seen as weak . It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . And make sure the onsite commanding officer knows that . You ! - Hyaah ! - ( GASPING ) What kind of skin are you ? - Koen ? - Latani . You 're safe . You know him ? - You 've ignored six calls from me . - I 'm here now . Same Hairy who hit the vans with the Zone prisoners . I 'm well aware of that . Your impromptu unauthorised announcement to the press , what the hell was that ? Tough measures needed to be taken . And then you made yourself completely uncontactable . What is it you 've actually done ? Other than be the front man for a procedure invented by Slade ? You couldn 't help with the attack on the vans . You found no information on the blue light creature . Everything you 've been in charge of has come under attack ... first the clinic and now this . You 're a liability . And you 're done if you don 't get me that Hairy rebel alive . Now . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS OVER RADIO ) - What 's the situation ? - They 're still inside .

Crossing live now to the scene , where the CA have the hostage site surrounded . WARUU : I want your men to move in . There 's one human amongst them . He must be taken alive . No-one fires unless it 's on my command . Copy that . Stand by to move it out . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Stand to . Stand to . KOEN : We need to make decisions now or these people will die . We fight . If they do , they 'll be killed . We are here because you didn 't fight for our culture . Where 's your pride ? _ _ ( CHANTS QUIETLY ) - We kill them all . - No , we won 't . - You with me ? - No . We 're Bindawu . This is our land . And we will have it back . Without skins . Killing more people won 't change anything . We fight now . We fight for sovereignty . That won 't get you anything but bloodshed . When has this land ever not had bloodshed on it ? You 'll kill some of them . Sure . But then they 'll kill all of you and they 'll start here . And when all of you included are gone and they 've bled the city dry , they 'll move out to the mountains , to the mobs in the deserts and the plains . They 'll wipe you all out . And for what ? It 's OK to fight . But if you 're going to fight , be smart . Koen is right . We 're outnumbered . We fight , we 'll all die . You trust this skin ? You think he can save you ? I have no love for this man . But I will not now offer myself up as a sacrifice to the humans . We need to leave . They can 't fight . - Their strength 's been taken . - Hide . Like scared little children ! I know a way out of here . I 've used it before . - Then we run . - No-one 's running . What are you going to do ? You 're going to force them to stay ? Kill your own people if they resist you ? Jarli , come with us . We need you . You can 't get out anyway without fighting . You can if the CA are distracted . You give me two minutes and then you lead everyone out of here , OK ? Let 's go . Will you come with us ? I will not run . Forward position , go ! Hold your fire . Fall back . Go ! Move in . Go ! The people in this building did nothing wrong . People ? Subhumans . They killed an innocent man here last night . You 've taken everything away from them . What do you want ? The government needs to sit down and negotiate a treaty - with the Hairypeople . - Our people don 't even have a treaty . What makes you think the Hairies will get one ? I 'll surrender myself to the government . You 'll be the man that saved the city . Do you have the authority to make that deal ? Or do I have to talk to your boss ? I have the authority . Prove that I can trust you . What did you see ? Enough . I surrender . Guards , contain this man . Wait . No , Mum . Mum , wait . Wait . I 'll go first . We don 't know if they 've got the exit covered . I know . What are you going to say to your bosses when they can 't find me ? I 'll think of something . What have you done ? You 're not the only one who 's special , little brother . You used to fight for the right reasons , Waruu . The younger hunter , he crafted a stronger , much larger boomerang . He takes the boomerang , smears blood all over it like lava . It travels so fast and with so much power it cuts through the hunter , killing him instantly . You never did listen to Uncle Jimmy 's stories . Brrrr ... ( CHUCKLES ) No . No !

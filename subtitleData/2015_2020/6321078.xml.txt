 THIS IS PRESIDENT JEFFREY MICHENER ADDRESSING ALL AMERICANS FROM THE NAVY SHIP THE USS NATHAN JAMES , WHICH IS NOW ENTERING THE HEART OF THIS GREAT NATION , THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER . WE ARE SURVIVORS OF THIS GREAT PLAGUE , JUST AS YOU ARE . WE HAVE STRUGGLED , JUST AS YOU HAVE , AND WE STILL HAVE GREAT HOPE IN THE FUTURE , JUST AS YOU DO . COURT ! COURT , LOOK ! I KNOW THAT YOU 'VE STAYED ALIVE THIS LONG BY ISOLATING YOURSELVES ... WHAT YOU GOT , BABY ? ... AND YOUR FAMILIES , THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING IN FEAR , [ RADIO TUNING ] FEAR OF THE VIRUS , FEAR OF EACH OTHER ... SONIA , COME LISTEN TO THIS ! ... FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN . THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT . DESPICABLE RUMORS AND MISLEADING VIDEOS HAVE BEEN BROADCAST FROM THIS NETWORK , LIES DESIGNED TO MANIPULATE YOU , TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS SHIP AND THE PEOPLE ON IT ARE YOUR ENEMY . NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH . THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THIS SHIP ARE SOME OF THE BRAVEST , NOBLEST THAT I HAVE EVER MET , AND IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO BRING ALL OF US THE CURE HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY THOSE WHO THRIVE ON YOUR FEAR . I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT WE DO HAVE THE CURE FOR THE RED FLU . ATTACHED TO THIS MESSAGE IS VIDEO FOOTAGE WHERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF OUR DOCTOR ATTENDING AND CURING PATIENTS SICK WITH THE VIRUS . IT IS OUR MISSION NOW TO SPREAD THIS CURE TO AS MANY OF YOU AS WE CAN . AT NOON TOMORROW , THE 18th , WE EXPECT TO LAND AT THE DOCKS IN VICKSBURG , WHERE WE WILL REMAIN IN PORT FOR SIX HOURS . ON THE 20th , WE 'LL ARRIVE IN TENNESSEE . WE HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH A FEW BRAVE CITIZENS AT THE COLLEGE OF MEMPHIS . OUR TEAM WILL MEET PEOPLE THERE AT 9 : 00 A.M. , AGAIN , FOR A PERIOD OF SIX HOURS . WE 'LL END OUR JOURNEY AT 10 : 00 A.M. THE FOLLOWING DAY , THE 21st , AT THE PORT OF ST . LOUIS . IT 'S TIME TO TURN THE TIDE AND THE BLOODSHED , PUT THE PAST BEHIND US , AND HEAL THIS GREAT NATION , ALL OF US TOGETHER . THANK YOU . [ CAMERA BEEPS ] RUN THAT EVERY 15 MINUTES FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS . GOT IT . ¶ ¶ Val : ON EACH PHONE IS AN APP . JUST PRESS THE EAGLE , AND IT 'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT IN . YOU HIT THE ICON , FIRST THING YOU 'LL SEE IS A PHOTO OF IMMUNE LEADER KEVIN MacDOWELL - - NUMBER THREE UNDER THE RAMSEYS , ONE OF THEIR FOUNDING MEMBERS , CAME TO AMERICA MONTHS AGO , STARTED THE MOVEMENT HERE . HE 'S STILL AT LARGE , LAST SEEN IN FLORIDA . ARE WE EXPECTING HIM TO BE IN VICKSBURG ? UNLIKELY . HE MAINTAINS THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE DEADMAN NETWORK , SO HE CAN STILL CAUSE TROUBLE . DR. SCOTT ? WITH THE WIDE RADIO CALL , [ SIGHS ] WE 'VE HOPEFULLY GIVEN A LARGE ENOUGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE IT TO THE PORT . AS WE PULL IN TO SHORE , YOU 'LL ALL BE GIVEN BOOSTER SHOTS TO COMPLIMENT THE VACCINATIONS ALREADY RUNNING THROUGH YOUR BODIES . WITHIN AN HOUR , THESE BOOSTERS WILL MAKE YOU VESSELS FOR THE CONTAGIOUS CURE . FOR HOW LONG ? YOU 'LL BE CONTAGIOUS FOR FIVE TO EIGHT DAYS , DURING WHICH TIME , IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU PASS IT ON TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE , WHO WILL THEN HAVE FIVE TO EIGHT DAYS TO DO THE SAME , AND SO ON . WE NEED A MINIMUM OF 10,000 PEOPLE AT EACH STOP TO SUFFICIENTLY SPREAD THE CURE ACROSS THESE SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY . WHAT ABOUT DROPPING THE CURE FROM THE SKY ? DIDN 'T YOU FIND A WAY TO MAKE THE AEROSOL WORK ? I DID . UNFORTUNATELY , I ONLY HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY , PERHAPS NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR THE CROWD THE SIZE THAT I AM HOPING FOR . SO ... THE CONTAGIOUS CURE REALLY IS OUR BEST HOPE . OKAY , SO , WE MAKE PORT , AND THEN WE GO AROUND BREATHING ON ANYONE WE CAN FIND ? THE CURE IS IN THE SWEAT ON YOUR BODIES AND THE MOISTURE IN YOUR BREATH . IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFUL TRANSMISSION - - WOULD YOU BE SO KIND ? YOU SHAKE THE TARGET 'S HAND , YOU BRING THEM IN GENTLY . WITHIN SIX INCHES , YOU BREATHE NORMALLY , BUT FORCEFULLY FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS AS YOU 'RE HOLDING THEIR HAND AND MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT . I 'M SORRY FOR THE ONIONS . [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU TRY TO MAKE IT AS NATURAL AND AS FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE . THANK YOU SO MUCH . EQUALLY EFFECTIVE WOULD BE TAKING A DRINK AND SHARE IT WITH THEM . IF THEY DRINK ANY SMALL AMOUNT AND YOUR SALIVA MIXES , THEN YOU ARE GOOD TO GO . I GUESS KISSING WOULD WORK , TOO . YOU DIDN 'T MENTION THAT . OH , FOR SURE . KISSING COULD BE A WAY TO GO IF YOU 'RE UP FOR IT AND CAN GET WRITTEN CONSENT . NOW , ONE IMPORTANT THING TO MENTION - - YOU CAN ONLY GET THE BOOSTER SHOT ONCE , SO IF THE CHAIN OF IMMUNIZATION IS BROKEN AND WE DON 'T SUCCESSFULLY SPREAD THE CONTAGIOUS CURE ... WE DON 'T GET ANOTHER CHANCE . Cruz : WE 'RE GOING UP RIVER WITH NO TOMAHAWKS , NO SM-2s , NO SHELLS FOR THE 5-INCH , AND BARELY ENOUGH AMMO FOR OUR SENTRIES . Jeter : THANKS TO VAL 'S NETWORK , THE PRESIDENT 'S SPOKEN TO MOST OF THE IMMUNE LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY . THEY 'VE AGREED TO STAND DOWN IN EXCHANGE FOR PARDONS . AND WE 'RE TRUSTING THEIR WORD ? WE HAVE TO REPAIR THE SHIP , AND WE HAVE TO REFUEL . NOW , THE AIRFIELD IN ST . LOUIS GIVE US THE BEST SHOT AT THAT . AND HEADING UPRIVER MEANS WE SPREAD THE CURE , WIN HEARTS AND MINDS , WHICH IS OUR MISSION . I GET THAT , MASTER CHIEF . BUT WE 'RE PUTTING OUT A CALL ON AN OPEN CHANNEL , LETTING THE WHOLE COUNTRY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US . IF PEOPLE COME LOOKING FOR A FIGHT , WE 'LL BE OUTMANNED AND OUTGUNNED . So , I heard you 've been pardoning everybody . That 's real presidential of you . YOUR OFFER EXPIRES IN 20 MINUTES . SURRENDER NOW . Oh , my dear Jeffrey , how quickly you 've changed your colors . LET 'S MAKE IT 10 MINUTES . I BELIEVE I HAVE THE COORDINATES , SIR . HE 'S STILL IN NORTHERN FLORIDA . WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE , KEVIN . A TOMAHAWK MISSILE CAN BE SITTING IN YOUR LAP IN 90 SECONDS , IF THAT 'S WHAT YOU WANT . So , which is it then - - mercy or threats ? You better get your story straight . YOU CAN 'T WIN THIS , MacDOWELL . IT 'S OVER . AND YOU HAVEN 'T HUNG UP , SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ? You were my protégé . [ Sighs ] Do you remember how I found you , all curled up in a ball , moaning about your wife , your children ? Such a sad sack you were . AND WHERE IS IT THAT YOU 'RE GOING ? We 're a global organization . You know how big our reach is . I 'll get out of your hair for now , but rest assured , you and me , we 've got unfinished business . YOU SURE YOU DON 'T HAVE ONE MISSILE LEFT ? CAN YOU TRACK THEIR PHONES ? [ KEYS CLACKING ] PLEASE DON 'T INSULT ME . Alisha : THE TRANSMISSION CAME OVER VHF . THEY ASKED FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY . DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ? I DIDN 'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK . WHO ARE THEY ? THEY 'RE MY WIFE 'S PARENTS . REMEMBER - - IT 'S AN OPEN LINE . THIS IS RUSSELL JETER HAILING SONIA AND HENRY MORRIS ON CHANNEL 1-6 . OVER . SONIA : Russell ? It 's Sonia and Henry . HENRY : How are you , son ? HANGING IN THERE , SIR . QUESTION IS , HOW ARE YOU ? WHERE ARE YOU ? We 're down in Laurel . Found an abandoned old cabin with a well and a generator . It 's just a couple hundred miles from Vicksburg . We heard the message over the broadcast that your ship has the cure . Is it true ? IT IS TRUE . IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE . SONIA : We have a truck , and there 's a gas station a couple of miles from here that might have some fuel . Should we try to get to you ? HENRY : We think we can make it if we leave now . WHERE YOU ARE - - IT 'S SAFE THERE ? Haven 't seen another soul for months . We 've been rationing our food , making runs when we need to . And there 's decent hunting . CAN YOU HANG IN A FEW MORE WEEKS ? I CAN COME AND FIND YOU THEN . SONIA : Why , Russell ? Is there something wrong with Vicksburg ? I WILL TRY AND REACH YOU BACK ON THIS FREQUENCY ONCE I KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS THERE . UNTIL THEN , I NEED YOU TO STAND BY AND WAIT TO HEAR FROM ME , OKAY ? HENRY : Well , if you think it 's safer for us to stay put ... THAT IS WHAT I THINK ... FOR NOW . MAKE SURE THEY STAY TURNED ON . WHY CAN 'T WE JUST TOSS THEM ? BECAUSE THE NAVY 'S GONNA BE TRACKING THEM , DIMWIT . OUR CARGO LOADED UP ? YEAH , EVERYBODY 'S PACKED IN TIGHT . WE 'RE READY TO ROLL . YOU GET THE UNIFORMS ? IT 'S JUST NINE . IT 'S ALL WE COULD GET FROM THE SURPLUS . NINE IT IS , THEN . YOU GO WITH DARREN AND HIS TEAM AND GET RID OF THE PHONES . Man # 1 : OKAY , GOT IT . THE REST OF YOU MEN WITH ME . LET 'S GO ! WE 'VE GOT A SCHEDULE TO KEEP . Man # 2 : ALL RIGHT , BOYS , LET 'S MOVE IT . Man # 3 : LET 'S GO . WE 'RE ROLLING . THE MISSISSIPPI . SNIPERS EVERY SIX FEET . BET YOU MARK TWAIN DIDN 'T GO UP THE RIVER WITH SENTRIES . NOT EVEN CLOSE . COMMODORE STILL KEEPING A GUARD ON YOU . HE IS NOTHING IF NOT A MAN OF HIS WORD . YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN . I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT ONCE WE LAND , I 'M GOING MY OWN WAY ... TO JACKSON . FOR YOUR DAUGHTER . THING IS , IS YOU SAID THE BOOSTER LASTS ONLY FIVE , SIX DAYS . I WAS THINKING I COULD BUM A COUPLE OF THE OLD-FASHIONED SHOTS OF THE VACCINE , IN CASE I DON 'T FIND THEM BY THEN . I THINK THAT COULD BE ARRANGED . Chandler : IS THIS MacDOWELL ? Val : HE 'S OVER THE ATLANTIC . LOOKS LIKE HE 'S HEADED FOR IRELAND . SCOTLAND , MAYBE ? WHAT 'S YOUR RANGE ON THOSE PHONES ? I 'LL PROBABLY LOSE HIM SOMEWHERE OVER NEWFOUNDLAND , BUT I 'M TRYING TO LINK INTO A SWEDISH SATELLITE , SEE IF I CAN CREATE A HANDOFF . THERE 'S NO AUTHORITY THERE EVEN TO WARN . EUROPE 'S NEXT ON THE DOCKET . HOW SOON TILL VICKSBURG ? 48 MINUTES . SEEN IT YET ? SHOULD BE COMING UP JUST NOW , SIR , TO THE EAST . Slattery : WHERE IS EVERYBODY ? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ? IT 'S NOT ENOUGH . IT 'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH . 127 PEOPLE , NO ONE ELSE FOR MILES . WELL , WE 'RE STILL BROADCASTING ON ALL CHANNELS . HOPEFULLY WE 'LL GET A FEW MORE STRAGGLERS . CAN WE STRETCH IT ANY LONGER ? NOT IF WE STILL WANT TO STOP IN MEMPHIS AND MAKE IT TO ST . LOUIS . GARNETT SAYS WE BARELY HAVE ENOUGH FUEL TO IDLE HERE FOR THE SIX HOURS . MAYBE WE SEND THE LAND TEAMS INLAND , SPREAD THE CURE , GET US SOME ANSWERS WHY PEOPLE STAYED AWAY . THEY CAN CATCH US UPRIVER , DEPENDING HOW IT GOES . LET 'S MAKE SURE WE PUT OUR TIGHTEST DETAIL ON THE PRESIDENT . HE 'S GONNA WANT TO SHAKE HANDS HIMSELF , ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO FAN OUT AND SPREAD THE CURE . IT 'S A P.R. GAME AS MUCH AS ANYTHING NOW . AYE , SIR . IF THINGS ARE GOING SOUTH , I CAN STICK AROUND . FIND YOUR GIRL , TEX . MEET ME IN ST . LOUIE , LOUIE . ¶ ¶ The President shook my hand himself , gave me the cure . Anybody wants or needs it , I 'm in Greenville , Mississippi , at the old church . THEY 'RE SPREADING IT . YOU HEARD THE OTHER ONES . VICKSBURG WAS A BUST . MICHENER THREW A PARTY , AND NOBODY SHOWED UP . THEY GOT WORD OF MOUTH NOW . WHAT 'S THAT GONNA MEAN FOR MEMPHIS ? WELL , THE MORE THE BETTER , AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED . WE 'LL HANDLE ALL TAKERS . [ POUNDING ] Man : [ Muffled ] HEY , WE 'RE HUNGRY ! WE NEED WATER ! SUPPOSE WE SHOULD FEED THEM . WE GOT TO KEEP THEM ALIVE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER , RIGHT ? [ PEOPLE COUGHING ] WE NEED WATER ! ALISHA : This is USS Nathan James on channel 1-6 CALLING SONIA AND HENRY MORRIS . IF YOU ARE OUT THERE , PLEASE RESPOND . LISTEN TO THIS . MAN : I 'm not lying . It was someone from that Navy ship . They said Vicksburg wasn 't safe , told his own family not to come . Woman : THAT 'S WHAT WE HEARD , TOO ... PATCH ME THROUGH . YES , SIR . ... But I just got some chatter from people . Supposedly , they had the cure , and the President even came out . THIS IS MASTER CHIEF RUSSELL JETER OF USS NATHAN JAMES . I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD MY FAMILY NOT TO COME TO VICKSBURG . I WAS WRONG . IT WAS SAFE THERE . THERE WAS NO FIGHTING . IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS , PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD . WE HAVE THE CURE . WE WILL BE IN MEMPHIS TOMORROW , 9 : 00 A.M. MEET US THERE . BECOME PART OF THE HEALING OF THIS COUNTRY . [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] STOP RIGHT THERE , EASY RIDER . [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] TURN AROUND AND GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM . I 'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU TWICE . I 'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER - - KATHLEEN . HER MOTHER - - CLAIRE NOLAN . YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ? SO , YOU 'RE KEN . YEAH . MY FRIENDS CALL ME TEX . I 'M COURT . CLAIRE AND KAT WERE STAYING HERE WITH ME . " WERE . " WHERE ARE THEY ? KAT HEARD ABOUT THAT SHIP WITH THE CURE . I TALKED HER OUT OF IT FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT , BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD TO FIND OUT FOR HERSELF . IT 'S TOO LATE TO CATCH THAT STOP IN VICKSBURG , SO SHE TOOK OFF , HEADING TOWARDS MEMPHIS . AND CLAIRE ? LOOTERS CAME IN THE NIGHT ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO . I THOUGHT A RACCOON HAD GOT IN THE KITCHEN . [ INHALES SHARPLY ] CLAIRE ... WAS THE FIRST DOWN THE STEPS . IT WAS QUICK , BUT SHE MANAGED TO WARN US . I HAD MY HANDS FULL WITH THE GUYS IN FRONT . KAT RAN TO MY ROOM , HAULED THIS OLD SHOTGUN OUT OF MY CLOSET , HELD IT AT HER WAIST LIKE I TAUGHT HER , AND FIRED POINT-BLANK THROUGH THE DOOR , GOT THE REST OF THOSE FELLAS AS THEY WERE COMING IN . THAT GIRL OF YOURS ... [ CHUCKLES ] SHE 'S GOT A HELL OF A HEART . STILL ... HAIL MARY CALL TO THAT SHIP . I TOLD HER NOT TO GO . I MEAN , HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT 'S REAL OR NOT ? IT 'S FOR REAL . WE GOT TO START SPREADING IT . Michener : VAL AND YOUR COMMS TEAM ESTIMATED THAT THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS 10,000 PEOPLE IN AND AROUND ST . LOUIS , THAT THERE 'S SOME KIND OF POWER AND INFRASTRUCTURE STILL IN PLACE . I DON 'T WANT TO GET MY HOPES UP , BUT LOOK AT ALL THESE ARTERIES FEEDING INTO THE CITY - - RIVERS , HIGHWAYS , RAILROADS . D.C. WAS THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY BACK IN THE 1790s . IT WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR THE CAPITAL THEN , BUT NOW - - NOW THE MIDWEST IS THE CENTER . THE GATEWAY TO THE WEST . HM . AS MUCH AS I 'D FANCY LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE , THIS IS A MORE EXPEDIENT PLAN . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] COME IN . I 'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU BOTH , BUT THERE 'S SOMETHING I FEEL I NEED TO TELL YOU . NOT LONG AFTER THE PRESIDENT 'S RADIO MESSAGE , COMMS PICKED UP A CALL FOR ME FROM MY MOTHER - AND FATHER-IN-LAW . WHEN THEY ASKED IF THEY SHOULD COME MEET US IN VICKSBURG , I TOLD THEM NO . NOW I CAN 'T GET AHOLD OF THEM . AND IT 'S CLEAR THERE 'S BEEN A - - THERE 'S BEEN A NEGATIVE DOMINO EFFECT FROM ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE OVERHEARD ME . IT WAS AN OPEN LINE ? I GOT BACK ON THAT CHANNEL MYSELF AND TRIED TO UNDO IT . BUT I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW . IT LOOKS LIKE I MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOW TURNOUT , AND IF SO ... I DEEPLY REGRET IT . I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING US KNOW , MASTER CHIEF . [ INHALES SHARPLY ] HE LOST THE REST OF HIS FAMILY YEARS AGO . THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALL HE HAS LEFT . EVERYONE 'S SUFFERED LOSSES . THIS COULD JEOPARDIZE MEMPHIS AND UNDERMINE EVERYTHING WE 'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO . FOR PEOPLE TO GET A MESSAGE LIKE THAT FROM OUR SHIP ? IT 'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE FOR PEOPLE TO TRUST AGAIN , WHETHER OR NOT THEY HEARD WHAT THE MASTER CHIEF SAID . HE KNEW IT WAS AN OPEN LINE , AND HE MADE A CHOICE . YOU 'RE RIGHT . I 'M SORRY , SIR . WON 'T HAPPEN AGAIN . [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] ¶ ¶ Roberto : STAY AWAY FROM ME . STAY BACK . STAY AWAY FROM ME . [ COUGHS ] I 'M SICK . WHO DID THIS ? THEY STILL AROUND ?

VULTURE TEAM 'S 30 MILES OUTSIDE OF MEMPHIS . TEX IS GONNA TRY TO HOOK UP WITH THEM THERE . THEY DITCHED ALL THEIR PHONES . I-I CAN 'T TRACK THEM AT ALL . THAT 'S SMART ... FLYING THEM OVER THE ATLANTIC . YOU WANT ME TO SEND OUT A MESSAGE TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM MEMPHIS ? WE DO THAT , WE LOSE ALL OUR CREDIBILITY ... FOR GOOD . I GET THAT , BUT WE DON 'T WANT ANOTHER NEW ORLEANS ON OUR HANDS . THEY 'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A SHOOT - ' EM-UP THIS TIME . THEY 'RE TRUCKING IN THE SICK TO INFECT THE CROWD , CREATE A PANIC SO THAT NO ONE EVER ANSWERS OUR CALL AGAIN . HOW FAR OUT ARE WE ? FOUR HOURS . HOW MANY MILES , AS THE CROW FLIES ? 37 . SEND THE HELO ? WITH THE AEROSOL . THIS IS ENOUGH FOR HOW MANY ? IT SHOULD BLANKET AN AREA OF HALF A SQUARE MILE , DEPENDING ON THE WINDS AND HOW CONCENTRATED AN AREA THE PEOPLE ARE PACKED INTO . GIVEN OUR LIMITED SUPPLY , WE 'LL HAVE ONE CHANCE . HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE EXPECTING THIS TIME ? JUST GIVE ME EVERYTHING YOU 'VE GOT . THIS IS THE LAST OF IT . [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS AND BIRDS CHIRPING ] THERE 'S GOT TO BE THOUSANDS SHOWN UP BY NOW , BOSS . JEFFREY THINKS THEY HAD A SHABBY CROWD AT VICKSBURG . AFTER THIS , THE ONLY AMERICANS WHO SHOW UP TO GREET THAT SHIP WILL BE LOOKING TO SINK IT . YOU LET THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MEMPHIS SEE THAT THE U.S. NAVY DIDN 'T BRING A CURE AFTER ALL . AND THEN YOU CHASE THEM OUT , AND YOU LET THEM RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN , SPREADING THE VIRUS AND THE BAD NEWS . [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] KATHLEEN NOLAN ! KATHLEEN ! KATHLEEN !

I got eyes on more Immunes , also sporting Navy blue . Stay tuned . Man : NAVY 'S HERE . THAT 'S RIGHT . AT YOUR SERVICE . WE 'RE HERE TO GET YOU ALL SICK , COURTESY OF YOUR UNITED STATES NAVY .

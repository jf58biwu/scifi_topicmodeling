So I am not staying here for a second longer . I can 't make you , but it is safer here .

Our hope is he 'll lead us to the others . - When do we get to examine it ? - That won 't be possible . Our companies have funded your operation for years . Unlimited resources . Total access . All because you claimed there are a handful of synthetics who can think and feel . Now you 've finally found one , I think we 've earned the right to study it . Robert , these machines are conscious . How do you know they don 't just simulate it ? How do I know you don 't ? I knew David Elster . Assimilation would be of no interest . His goal was to create machine life , as he called it . - Oh , so they 're alive now ? - No . A parody of it . Which is why they are so dangerous . Oh , come on . They 're just freaks . Do you know what the singularity is ? A mathematician named John Von Neumann coined the term in the 1950s to describe the inevitable point in the future when technology surpasses us , when it becomes able to improve and reproduce itself without our help . It is the moment when we become inferior to the machine . Now , our world is ... is on the verge of becoming dependent on synth labour . Now , these synths are physically no different to any others , and yet ... Elster gave them consciousness . If it can be done for the few , it can be done for them all . And then what ? Do you think they would still want to be slaves ? These freaks are the singularity . ( BLEEPING ) ( GENTLE CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC PLAYS ) I can 't let you be recycled . Is it a game ? There 's things that you know . She cried and laughed . She cried when I pulled the bee sting out . But then ... then ... then ... then ... then ... At the doctor 's , she laughed .

( GEORGE CONTINUES LAUGHING ) Your favourite is ... is ... is ... apricot ... ( CLATTERING ) ( TURNS PIANO MUSIC VOLUME UP ) What would you say if I asked what you thought of this music ? I 'd say it 's very well played . What do you base that on ? I compare the pitch , tonality and rhythm of the performance to the sheet music that I access via ... No . Do YOU think anything of it ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm afraid I don 't understand the question . Making lasagne and talking philosophy with a bloody tin can . Right . Those veg should be done . ( SIZZLING ) Mummy ! I want to give Anita a goodnight kiss ! - ( INTENSE SIZZLING ) - Aah ! Ah ! I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm fully qualified in first aid . I prioritised the risk to Sophie 's safety . Sophie , you silly girl ! You 're supposed to be careful around the oven . Bed , now ! - LAURA : Ow ! - ( FOOTSTEPS RECEDE ) Ow ! MAN ON TV : Have these machines devalued human existence ? MAN 2 : The best reason for making machines more like people is to make people less like machines . The woman in China who works 11 hours a day stitching footballs . The boy in Bangladesh inhaling poison as he breaks up a ship for scrap . The miner in Bolivia risking death every time he goes to work . They can all be part of the past . Synthetic devices free people . We 've treated people like machines for too long . It 's time to liberate their minds , their bodies , to think , to feel , to be more human . But a lot of people would argue that work is a human right . If anything , that hard work gives you a sense of self-worth . MAN 2 : I think you should spend one week working in a microchip facility . So we 're all gonna be poets or something ? What a load of crap . - Oi , slagchops , I 'm watching that ! - Watch it in your room , knobcock . JOE : Alright . Both of you to your rooms . - MATTIE : Seriously ? - JOE : Now ! - MATTIE : I 'm not 12 . - TOBY : Why do you always do this ? - MATTIE : Do what ? - TOBY : You just ruin everything . MATTIE : You weren 't watching it . ( DULL THUD ) ( WHISPERS ) I think the back door just opened . That 's Mattie smoking again . Then you 'll have a screaming row and she 'll smoke somewhere else for a bit . Fingers crossed it 's only burglars . ( BIRD CAWS ) ( UNEASY MUSIC ) Anita , you need to stay inside after we go to bed . Is that clear ? ANITA : Of course , Laura . I 'm sorry . The moon is beautiful tonight . Don 't you think ? LAURA : They 're not supposed to ask questions like that . They 're not supposed to have accidents either . Are they ? JOE : We 're not taking it back . ( JOE SIGHS ) MAN 1 : Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? Hundreds of millions operational across the world and not one single verified instance of a synth knowingly injuring a human . Their sole purpose is to make our lives better . They aren 't sentient . They don 't have any thought , emotion or awareness . The Asimov blocks in their programming mean that they simply aren 't able to do us any harm . MAX : What if you can 't find her ? ( GROANS SOFTLY ) I will find her , Maxie . Because I love her . - And she loves me . - ( DOG BARKS NEARBY ) MAN 1 : But do you believe that one day , we will have a truly artificially intelligent synth , one that thinks and feels like a human ? How can we replicate something we hardly understand in ourselves ? How would we even know if we succeeded ? MAN 1 : But it 's something you 're working towards ? MAN 2 : Think of the problems to solve before we get there . What is human emotion ? For example , what is love ? Is it something we are born with , or can it be learnt ? ( DOOR BEEPS AND OPENS ) Panties down , not off . MAN 2 : And what about the darker feelings ? Fear , anger , violence ? Human consciousness is not complete without them . And memory . Ours are subjective , fallible . But how do you teach a computer to forget ? Or to dream ? It 's something our minds need to do . Would a conscious synth have to be able to dream to have nightmares ? Of course not . They 're just machines .

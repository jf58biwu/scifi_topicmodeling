A deal between mafia groups ... That 's Mad Gallan . One of the 12 Genmakuu Apostles ... then this deal is gonna be huge . Shelly . no ! We need to wait for the Fire Squad ! The new Director says we 're working with them . I 'm not really a team player . You 're all the help I need . But ... I like working with you ! And I wanna tackle even bigger cases together !

We only know he 's a brilliant scientist and an expert swordsman . To think that deal was a trap ... Dammit ... I don 't know what to say about Shelly . But why was the body missing ? Director ... No . Huh ? I didn 't say anything yet . You 're off the case . Why ? ! I want to bring the guy who shot Shelly in myself — And that 's why I said no ! Right now you 're just out for vengeance . I don 't think you 're fit to take on any cases . I am calm ! Then ... Here 's a question . we 've managed to sell over 25 billion packs ! { thats a lot of baby shit } What do you think of this handsome boy ? just look at the smile shine ! Papa mama and baby ! Easy for the whole family ! These are the diapers you need ! Smile and gentleness ! It 's just so catchy ... ma 'am ? See ? You 're not composed at all . there are rumors that they 're up to no good . Ow ... ow ! huh ? Our first story ... you 're off this case . That 's an order . An ESPer ... ? The ability to read objects ... Understood . Excuse me . an update on the string of bloodletting incidents that have shocked the galaxy . bringing the total number of victims to 235 . and were found after all of their blood was drained . but they currently have no noteworthy leads ... No end of trouble around here lately . Hold it ! This is Tetsu ! I 'm pursuing the suspect in the vampiric killings ! Vice-Captain . Ms. Swan ... How is the other team doing ? 10 meters until contact ... 4 meters ... 3 meters ! I hate that I have to work today ... It 's such nonsense . I would 've loved to attend the wedding ceremony ...

Deka Break ! and smashing through fearsome darkness ! The Daybreak Detective ! Deka Break ! Electro Fist ! " in the terms list btw } Nonsense . Save the excuses for the interrogation room . I 've got the suspect in custody . Good work . The other team ... They 're just about to exchange rings . was Waiiha in Kyuranger } You may now lift the veil .

Hold it right there ! No way ! Could it be ? ! Is this one of those " Koume is mine ! " kinda deals ? ! You probably shouldn 't be glad about that ! right ? I guess I 'm the one in demand here ? but how can I help you ? with the Galactic Federation Police . Need your cooperation on an urgent matter ASAP . at a time like this ... ? ! then ? very well . A dog policeman ! actually . You can count on courage ! that 'll have to wait . right ? I need your help right now . Hold it right there yourself ! You interrupt what is probably my once-in-a-lifetime wedding and you 're here for Jasmine ? ! What the heck ? ! But that 's not the issue ! you folks go right on ahead . Come on . Hey ! Jasmine ? we can 't get married if there 's trouble ! you take it from here ! U-Umeko ? ! Ume ... U ... U-Umeko ... ? now ? ! one of the 12 Genmakuu Apostles ... He 's m anufacturing a weapon of mass destruction . And ... one of his men is packing serious heat . I want you to use your power to help identify him . This is it ... get to it . Okayyy ... He is so pushy ! Talk about a jerk ! Easy there ... Jasmine is an esper . she can read the memories of others who have done so . The shooter had an arm that turns into a rifle ... { The person who was shooting had an arm that turns into a rifle ... } sorry } { muscle-y could be Jasmine speak . Look at this again } { not a thing in older scripts } That sounds like the fugitive Bergian ! Is this him ? Cronen . meet donkey . A mercenary who 'd kill his own parents for the right price . Let me see . Do we have any eyewitness reports on this guy ? we need you to look something up . What is it ? Venues for the after party ? actually ... We need you to use the Alienizer tracking system to look for a certain face . I 'll send the data . Cronen was found to have been caught by one of the Earth precinct 's automated cameras . Didn 't think he 'd be on Earth ... Thanks for your help . I 'll take it from here . What are you talking about ? Earth is our jurisdiction ! That truck ... It has to be ! We need to report to Boss ! It can wait ! Hang onto something ! that 's not right ... I must be slipping . Take care of it ! You ... ! You two again . Your combat ability is as low as ever . who is this supposed to be ? Benikiba . In the name of the Prophet Fumein ... You guys take care of her ! Hey ! You — ! Electroplate ! Laser Z Beam ! Good grief ... huh ? ! You shot Shelly ! And what if I did ? ! Take this ! Mad Gallan ... ! This is just sad . over some woman ... What 'd you say ? ! I 've seen through your combat ability . it 's useless ! We won 't know that until we try ! That 's right ! Deka doesn 't just mean cop in Japanese ! Deca means 10 in Greek ! And we 're 10 times brave ! Ridiculous . The Galactic Federation Police must have fallen on hard times . Dammit ... You think you can defeat me with that prehistoric sword of yours ? Shut up ! This Laser Blade is my soul ! And a pitiful soul at that . Quit running your mouth ! Dammit ... ! Laser Blade ! Gavan Hyper Dynamic ! Pathetic . Mad Galactic ! No ... Geki . These Laser Blades are the souls of each Space Sheriff . Your own heart will be reflected clearly in it ! Wielding this sword 's shine is the sign of a proud Space Sheriff . { wat ? is this shining sword ? or this some profound showa shit } Don 't ever forget that . sir ! My soul ... ! I suppose you 're done . Farewell . Striking like a hurricane ! Watch out ! Dammit ... I 'll avenge Shelly ! Calm down ! Look at your sword for a second . Don 't touch it ! isn 't it ? ! What a sorry sight you are . How could youd understand ? ! Tetsu ! Sir ! it 's been a while ! Good to see you . quit getting dirt everywhere ! Cleaning Ray ! clean as a daisy ! How 'd things turn out with your suspect from the vampiric killings ? He had an alibi . So the case is back where it started ... A notice demanding cooperation in the investigation ... I 'm amazed they didn 't take you off the case . who will ? What would you do if a friend ... If your partner was killed ? What about you ? Or you ? What would any of you do ? I want to settle things myself . And I 'm willing to do whatever it takes . things have taken an odd turn . The bullet we retrieved from Dolgiran 's exterior ... It was something unique . Not listed in the database . What 's this ? It 's like some kind of mollusk ... It was manufactured with biomimetics ... It 's been made to recreate a type of space leech . it transforms into an organism with two horns ... it drains the blood from the victim 's body . It can drink an entire body 's worth of blood . isn 't this the same as the serial vampiric killings ? Exactly . This is what 's been drinking everyone 's blood . So the person behind the murders is actually Cronen ? he 's the one pulling the trigger . And the one pulling the strings ... It 's Mad Gallan . The two cases are connected . No bullet was found in the victims or at the scene of the crime ... Mad Gallan must have retrieved them ! But ... why 's he collecting blood ? right ? The secret may be in the blood of the victims . Hikaru ? Maririn ? New diapers ! We 're running low ! Yeah . Bye now . Good luck with work . Bye-bye ! That 's awesome ! even at work ? I just remembered when she mentioned biomimetics . What do you mean ? Smile and Gentleness ' diapers ... too . Explains how they can absorb so much pee ! just look at the smile shine ! there are rumors that they 're up to no good . I need to borrow this ! Gavan ! What is it now ? ! Hold it ! Hey ! Boss ... Yeah ? Keep an eye on Gavan for me . why are you coming with me ? this is one of our cars ! Put the Smile and Gentleness HQ in the GPS . If one of my friends was killed ... I 'd probably go crazy for revenge . Then don 't get in my way . But I 'd still follow Boss ' orders . I mean ... I 'm a police officer ! so ... holed up on a station . I ... I move forward . That 's how I 've gotten by so far . too . What ? Don 't compare me to him . I 'm afraid you can 't — We 're not visitors . Where 's the president 's office ? This way ... Thanks . sorry ! wait a — ! Coming through . Wow ... legs and beauty ! Lars . That said ... officers . I 'll get right to the point then . Do you recognize this ? Can 't say that I do ... Take a good look ! Excuse me ... Come on ... My secretary was sent by Mad Gallan to watch me ! { is it just me or this looks slightly homoerotic } Our company makes these ! Mad Gallan 's threatening me ! What ? ! sir ? This way ! The production line for the bullets is down here ! Right . Mad Gallan gives the orders ? he hasn 't come here in person . The secretary conveys the orders ! if it isn 't Ms. Legs ! Lars ! Save me ! I don 't want to die ! - Quiet ! It 's okay ! We 'll keep you safe ! Your combat ability isn 't very impressive . me ? you 're asking for it ! Roundhouse ! { not sure about this } quick ! Don 't bother . There is a signal blocking communications from this building . Then ... I can 't call on my suit either ? ! I can 't transform ! That voice ... it 's Cronen ! What is it ? We 've discovered something among the victims who were drained ... All of the victims had abnormally high Ruremodenine counts in their blood . all the victims possessed some kind of natural transformation ability . Shelly did too ! She could turn into a parakeet ! Laser Vision ! So they 're after the blood of people with transforming abilities ... ? But they 're supposed to be manufacturing a weapon of mass destruction . They might use Shelly 's blood as an energy source . That could be it ... If you had technology on par with what Smile and Gentleness uses . Umeko ! just look at the smile shine ! Why is the song from the commercial ... ? What was that ... ? Where are you ? Umeko ! Umeko ... ! What happened ? ! I don 't know ! You don 't ? ! and that kunoichi got her ! the signal was blocked ... She shouldn 't have been fighting alone . what were you doing ? ! I went after Cronen . But ... he got away . Cronen ? You ... ! Was all this for your revenge ? ! dammit ! Hey ! Umeko ... Umeko ! This is your fault ! You did this to her ! and received emergency admission to the Space Police 's hospital . and it seems this request for assistance is a forgery . Forging official documents is a major crime . You 've got orders to return ASAP . It 's a shame ... I don 't really hate that bull rush philosophy of yours . This again ? or something ? He 's not my partner . Tetsu . You 're with me . We need to question Lars about what 's going on . Roger . let 's go check the office for evidence . Roger . I 'm going to work with Swan to analyze whatever this is . it 's true that my company aided criminals ... I will assume responsibility by dissolving the company . Dammit ! I like working with you ! And I wanna tackle even bigger cases together ! Shelly ... I 'm disappointed in you . I had hoped for a different outcome ... So much for that . sometimes . He ? None of your business . Reflect on what you 've done . That is all . Yo ! Instructor Gavan ! It 's so good to see you again ! I still remember your training ... give it a rest ! now ! force of habit . are you here about your successor ? What happened with him ? For him to break protocol like this ... for a while . Mad Gallan broke his Laser Blade ... What ? ! Is that true ? A Laser Blade is a Space Sheriff 's soul ... Geki ... This mud ... It matches the one found at the crime scene . But Lars said that he 'd never met Mad Gallan . What the ... ? It 's a blueprint for a weapon of mass destruction ! Your combat ability isn 't even worth measuring . This little thing seems to contain the material for a single combat suit ... Compressed nice and secure . Not to mention ... This technology uses a black hole 's energy ! I remember when I used to enjoy surprises . And the most prominent set of fingerprints on it ... They belong to Lars ! A power outage ? what 's the situation ? Hey ! What 's going on ? We need to let Deka Base know . Right . You 're not going anywhere ! get out and face me ! Looks like our guess was right . then ! Right ! Benikiba ! I 'm taking back the Masker Blade . Emergency ! Dekaran — Jasmine ! I do owe you some thanks . You helped me discover Shelly 's incredible power ... You have my gratitude . What ? ! Swan ! Jasmine ! What 's going on ? ! Mr. Lars ... what is this ? Mad Gallan . It 's a cutting edge Metaltech Suit . Mad Gallan ? ! In the name of the Prophet Fumein ... A different voice ... ? You 're a different person ? { it could be a voice modulator ! or maybe he 's batman idk tetsu you gotta open your mind yo } the original Mad Gallan 's power dwells within me . Emergency ! So strong ... and his personality is totally different ! I see ... You 're Hell 's Watch Dog . too . and waged war against Juspion ! But all you 've done is borrow that power ! Don 't think that you 've mastered it ! Cutting down evildoers by the hundreds ... Hell 's Watch Dog ! Deka Master ! D-Sword Vega ! Vega Slash ! What ? ! Boss ! Tornado Fist ! Mad Galactic ! Tetsu ! Pathetic ! You two need a lot of improvement ! Now you can 't escape . No way ... ! Boss ! Tetsu ! Benikiba was able to retrieve the Masker Blade ... And Lars turned into Mad Gallan ... Then we were right . This is all because Gavan broke protocol and dragged us into this ... ! Because he was so hungry for revenge ! Sen ! Umeko ! I 'm okay . guys ... Gavan wasn 't just out for revenge . He was still acting like a police officer ! That voice ... it 's Cronen ! What ? you two ! And bring backup ! It 's okay ! You go after Cronen ! Don 't order me ! just go ! Listen to your leader ! Hurry ! got it ! Take care of her ! But we didn 't realize Lars was working with Benikiba . Lars ... ? ! Honestly ... I was rather shocked when you people came to my office . you 're the b-list guest star in a low budget tokusatsu film ... . } It ... can 't be ... What 's wrong ? ! Hey ! What happened ? Gavan didn 't say you told him to go ... He 's just awkward and straightforward ! But think about it ! It 's because he barged in on our wedding that we found out about Cronen ! True ... either ! You 've got a point . There 's something else . Benikiba mentioned something that bothered me . You helped me discover Shelly 's incredible power ... You have my gratitude . Shelly 's incredible power ... ? Hang on ! Upsie daisy ! This is Sen 's thinking pose . he will generally make a breakthrough . That 's it ! The reason we didn 't find Shelly 's body mummified ... It could be because of her incredible power . What do you mean ? The blueprint for the weapon had an energy absorption device marked on it . they intend to use her transformative power . Shelly ... She 's still alive ! Boss . We 're gonna act a little crazy . Gavan 's influence ? Crazy ... I like the sound of that . Earth 's Dekarangers wouldn 't have it any other way . Doggie ? Count on courage ! Oh my ... Whatever became of your hand ? This hardly counts as a wound . Ninja Art : Genmakuu Regeneration . has this stroll down memory lane made you lose your edge ? you couldn 't kill one of your own . I can 't say I approve of such ... Lukewarm sentimentality . I 've forsaken my past ! Those memories are of nothing but death . you saved me ... Thank you kindly . It 's all in our Prophet 's name . The weapon you 're developing ... He requires Satan Goth . When will he be activated ? It won 't be long . We 're nearly there . In the name of the Prophet Fumein ... In the name of the Prophet Fumein ... just look at the smile shine ! In the name of the Prophet Fumein . you started out as a simple assassin I hired ... But I see you 've become a true believer . Yes . then ... Miss Space Sheriff ! Where am I ... ? I suppose we could call it hell . Although it 's heaven for us . Gavan ... No one 's coming . drained of your essence ! I don 't think so ! I would never ... the higher your Ruremodenine numbers climb ! we 're almost there ! can you ? ! Gavan ... ! Help me ... Gavan ! Shelly ... What am I doing locked in here ... ? ! Yahoo ! Gavan ! You ... what about your injuries ? Felt better after a nap ! that 's not true . You people ... What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry I hit you . Umeko explained what happened . Give me a break ... I still ignored orders ... And I broke protocol to run off . Because of that ... I ended up getting you hurt . too ! But for better or worse ... Your reckless antics set our hearts on fire . Reminds me of somebody ... You came all this way just to say that ? Taking such risks ... It 's not just that . We 're pretty sure Shelly 's alive . What ? ! Mad Gallan was Lars in disguise . ... What ? ! Lars is Mad Gallan ? ! He wants to use Shelly 's power for a weapon ... So he arranged for her attack and abduction . It was a setup all along . Then ... ! Shelly 's really ... ? What ? ! That bastard ... ! Don 't overdo it ! Open sesame ! watch it ! Get it ? Open sesame ... just look at the smile shine ! Why is it the song from the commercial ... ? That 's it ! what ? What 's it ? guys ! I need you to back me up ! Wait ! Ban ? You think you can win without your Laser Blade ? I 'm not sure . You 're going when you 're not sure ? I have to ! Only the incompetent resort to reckless antics . It 's not reckless ! Right now ... I 've got the best team I could ask for . with their help . Gavan ... that makes it unanimous ! we 're headed for Earth ! follow me ! I see ... But that doesn 't quite settle things just yet . You look quite lovely ! suffer more ! It 's pathetic to go this far against someone with no intent of retaliating . and thoroughly . { like cleaning poop ? } That 's my philosophy ! I understand . That completes my task as the Prophet assigned . You may take it from here . Are you sure you should let her leave ? Let her go . Not having to worry about the Prophet 's overseer will make things easier for us ! I won 't die ! I won 't die ... Gavan ! here we go ! Axe kick ! Jumping roundhouse ! Galaxy Punch ! Bang ! Off you go ! That 's it ! There 's a gate to a pocket dimension over there . Shelly should be on the other side . I don 't see anything . Is there some kind of switch ? it helped me realize it . Huh ? Realize what ? It was weird that Cronen would sing that song ... It 's the password to open the gate . Let me show you . okay ? just look at the smile shine ! It opened ! don 't just stand there ! Let 's go ! How did that not embarrass you ? ! Was the dance necessary ? ! - Hang on ! Almost there ... our great ambition will complete Satan Goth 's construction ! Stop it ! Gavan ... Shelly ! Hang in there . I 'm impressed you 've made it this far . You 've really done it now ... You 're gonna pay . I 'm pissed now ! Cronen ... Deal with the Dekarangers . yes ? Yes ... of course . In that case ... I will focus on punishing our friend here . don 't you ? I 'll keep him busy . Take care of Shelly . Right ! You think you can just wail on one of our comrades ? Completely unforgivable ! Now suffer the consequences ! Dekarangers ! Roger ! Roger ! Roger ! Roger ! Roger ! Electroplate ! The electroplating of Space Sheriff Gavan 's combat suit takes a mere 50 milliseconds . Electroplate ! let 's take another look at the electroplating process . Roger . Transmitting combat suit . Space Sheriff ... Gavan ! Standby to change ! Roger ! Emergency ! Dekaranger ! Face On ! Deka Base transmits it in a particulate form . forming the Deka Suits . On ! Satan Goth will be reborn soon . as part of the celebration . Save the rant for once you 're locked up ! Let 's go ! Spiral Kick ! Don 't think you 'll have your way inside the Satan Goth zone . The Satan Goth zone is composed of the negative energy emitted by black holes . A subspace where Mad Gallan fights with an advantage . Laser Z Beam ! Not yet . Try to amuse me more . No matter how cocky you are ... I will beat you in the end ! Nice . I like it when they 're a bit crazy ! this is nothing ! I can take anything you can dish out ! and die ! Over here ! Where 'd he go ? Split up ! Roger . Hi ! Gotcha . you 're pretty tough . You okay ? Yeah . man ! We can 't get attack him like this ! his arm is dangerous ! This won 't be a piece of rope at all . { this is actually rope not loaf but im sweaty and motivated so i wont stop now } Just say piece of cake ! Let 's work together to pen him in ! What exactly do we do ? I know ... I 've got just the thing . Dammit ... ! I 'm not done ! You can 't die just yet . otherwise . Mad Galactic ! you powerless Space Sheriff ! Gavan Dynamic !

Calm down . The commissioner gave me some new gear just for the occassion ! Hey ... Wha ... ? Shooting formation . I didn 't hear about this ! Giga Magnum ! Fire ! Got him ! that was pretty sweet ! Nicely done ... partner . I 'm not your partner . Shelly ! Gavan ... I 'm so glad you 're alive ! Of course I am ... I had faith ... Geki . Sorry it took me so long . As punishment ... okay ? Alright ! and buy you whatever you want ! this case is closed ! There 's clear skies over the city ! Let us get in on that ! good for you ! thank you for your words of praise . I 'll carry on then ... on to our ongoing operation . { not sure about thiiiis } In the name of the Prophet Fumein ... Juumonji Geki ... Reporting in . You are so very ... huh ? Entertaining ! this whole thing was a suggestion from Ban . Akaza Banban 's idea ? Director ... I think you should team him up with my old team . right ? Right . Pain is Power ! { I love this movie } what did you just make me do ? I meant the Dekarangers . then ? I 'm sure they 'll have quite the chemistry . huh ... And so ... I laid a bit of bait for you to contact the Dekarangers . ... they 're up to no good . Ban was right ! Take a leader who blazes headlong into things ... And a composed team of professionals ... The results were great ! You did a very good job ! Juumonji Geki . Yes ma 'am ? ! You are hereby named as the first captain of the Space Squad . Space Squad ? the World of Genmakuu ... the selection for which is underway right now . A specially selected team ... ? We still don 't know much about the Genmakuu ... It 'll need coordination between our forces throughout the galaxy . Captain Geki ... I 'm counting on you . Uh ... Shelly ... ? she 's going to be working at a desk for a while . But ... I want to work with her ... Well I refuse ! What ? ! Why ? ! Gavan ... you said so before . You wanted to tackle even bigger cases . That 's part of why you were involved this time ! So ... I think this is the best thing for you ! then you 're not the Gavan I know ! aren 't you ? ! Shelly ... ! and I 'll come along and kick your butt ! That hit a sensitive spot ... ! I get it . I 'll do it . so select whoever you think is best . Roger . See you around . the Space Squad is born . the day will come soon ... When they blaze through the galaxy ! And so ... once more ...

 - I can 't do this . - I love you . - SOBBING : - Oh , my God . - What the hell 's going on ? - This is Seth . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag . The child is lost ! You will not be welcome back here again . I love her . GUN COCKS - GUNSHOT - We need to get you to a hospital . No ! If you take me , my people will find me . The reason we can 't find the Castor samples is because Johanssen used them , to make a clone . Mark ! I 've got it . - Please let me go . - MARK : Stand down , soldier . I 'm your superior officer . We don 't leave loose ends . No , we don 't . You must be Parsons . - STRUGGLING : - Kill me . Guards ! HELENA GROANS SCORPION PURRS Pupok ... - PUPOK : - You killed their lab rat . What did you expect , cheesecake ? He was suffering . And now you are . HELENA SIGHS COUGHS Oh , Helena , guilty pleasures won 't help you escape . GASPS THEME MUSIC PLAYS Poor little brother . Never even saw the sunlight . No . His DNA doesn 't have the synthetic sequences that made you and your brothers viable . Viable but defective . But by comparing his genome to yours , we can isolate the defect . Develop a gene therapy . However , the major is returning . He 's not going to be happy about our new guest . No , he won 't . And I don 't need you stirring the pot , so you 're going to leave . Ma , no . I should be here for Mark to debrief . You and your brother did well . I 'll debrief him when he 's stable . You have 48 hours - enjoy yourself . Yes , ma 'am . Hey . Hey ! - POUNDING ON DOOR - Hey ! Hello ! Hello ! Anybody ? Oh , shit ! HELENA : Not so smart after all . Oh , my God ! Helena ? Helena ! Hey ! Hey ! Oh , God , you 're alive ! What have they done to you ? Are you OK ? I 'm most wonderful . Hey , look at me . What have they done to you ? You put me here . What ? No ! Hey , are you hurt ? - Hey ... - You did this to me ! And now you make deal with their mother . Me for you . - SIGHS - Shit ! Yes , much shit . Hey , hey , that 's not what happened . I don 't know anything about their mother . - PUPOK : - Give her nothing ! Don 't worry , Pupok , I will sew my mouth shut . What ? Helena , please , look at me ! Sarah , it 's Art . You were supposed to check in , - let me know that you 're OK . - KNOCK ON DOOR Don 't let me worry . Are you Arthur Bell ? What can I do for you ? Sarah said to come here if I was ever in any trouble . You met Sarah ? - When ? - Two days ago . In Halton . Well , you better come inside . - MRS S : - Thanks , love . - FELIX : Of course . You know , tracking down long-lost clone children takes time . She said she 'd call if she had any news . Just a wee bit concerned . Me too . MOBILE VIBRATES Then again , we should probably be concerned about this . Cosima , she got an internet date . - Oh ! - CHUCKLES Hello , Sapphire . I can already tell this is going to be a waste of time . Cos , you 're scouting , nothing more . You 're just there for 20 minutes to determine some physical chemistry . Oh , God , Felix ! 'Just be yourself . ' - And don 't bail , OK ? - OK . - Ciao , darling . - Bye . EXHALES Don 't worry , you 'll be fine . I 'm just super-nervous . I don 't want to , like , fart or spill my tea on her or something . Just don 't spill your purse . No-one wants to hear about an ex . Do I , like , reek of it or something ? - Yeah . - I just ... Dang , girl ! - Hey ! - Hi ! Sorry . - Cosima . - Shay . Hi . - CLEARS THROAT - Wow . I mean , I saw your pictures , but ... are you sure you 're in the hard sciences ? Yeah , yeah , I am . Um ... thank you , I think . GRACIE : We went back to the hotel , but my mother found me . We had a big fight . - What about Mark ? - I don 't want to talk about Mark . Look , Gracie , if you 're pregnant , the best place for you to be is with family . Is there anybody else who 's not involved , an aunt , a cousin , maybe ? Nobody . Well , I got to get to work . OK , so I 'm going to take you to a shelter . You 're an expectant mother , you 'll be first priority . I lost the baby . That 's why they cast me out . I think I know someone who can help . - SHAY : - You 're nervous ? Is this your first Sapphire date ? Yeah , yeah , it is . Uh , I just got out of a relationship , so I 'm ... not supposed to say that . CLICKS TONGUE I 'm nervous and so I 'm babbling and it 's not good . It 's OK . Here , I 'll babble , OK ? Um , my first internet date , bridge-and-tunnel goth . Black choker , spiderweb eye make-up , I mean , the whole shebang , and none of it in her pictures . And the best part , every time she thought we had a connection she insisted on high-fiving me . - Ooh , wow ! - Yeah . - I 'm way worse than that . - You totally are . - I 'm warning you now . - Thank you . So , you from , uh , you from around here ? This is how we do this , OK ? Prairie girl , hated the winters , two siblings , parents split when I was six , pescatarian , blue , Barcelona . Barcelona 's your favourite city ? Yeah , it is . - Up high , buddy ! - Ooh ! - No . No . You 're hilarious . - Ooh ! - Not doing it . - It 's kind of my thing . - No . No , no way . - No ? - No , no high fives . - SARAH : - Helena , I ... Yes , yes , there was a deal made for you , but I didn 't make it . Mrs S did . She traded you to Castor to get me and Kira out of Dyad . She made a bad choice . - PUPOK : - Sarah 's lying . She 's poison . She 's going to melt you like butter . Shut up about the butter ! What ? Look ... Mrs S , she made that decision to protect her granddaughter . Think of what you 'd do to protect that baby in your belly . Keep it far away from you . You know , I had to send Kira away again , because these Castor arseholes came after us . But I knew I had to come find you because we can 't fight them alone . You know , I should 've just left you here to bloody rot ! In convent , I lived for four months in a broom closet . I do not rot . DISTANT DOOR OPENS Five , four , three , two , one ... DOOR UNLOCKS Another one of you bastards . Back away from the door . Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . Against the wall . I don 't think so . Come on , let 's go . - Helena ! - Let 's go . - Hey , Helena ! - Come on . Helena , you know they 're our brothers , right ? They tell you that ? Head down . CREAKING Oh , you 're the bad mother , eh ? Dr Virginia Coady . You must be very proud of your boys . Fine , let 's chat . What have you done to my sister ? Helena 's fine . She 's been confined and controlled much of her life . My opinion , a secure environment gives her comfort . This is Dr Silva . What are you ... What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You got your bloody genome , what do you need ? A contribution . We have high hopes for the original DNA , but your biology can 't be ignored . So we 're going to take some stem cells by filtering your blood . It 's a process called apheresis . We 'll start with some samples . You can go to hell , you know that ? Psycho bitch ! I 'm not someone you can fight , Sarah . It 's probably the last place you expected to be . But these are good people . OK ? FELIX : This is insane ! They 're creepy , crypto-religious fanatics . Look , she says she split from them and I believe her . Then fine , why don 't you keep her ? After everything she 's been through , she needs a friend , not a cop . And she knows her husband 's a clone ? Yeah , she seems to . And she 's obviously struggling with it . Yeah , well , she doesn 't look ready for cult-deprogramming to me . She looks a damn sight better than you did when I took you in . I was not yet formed . You were a budding delinquent at six . Now , go on . Help her get settled and I 'll see Arthur out . Go on ! You , baby Jesus , come up the stairs with me . Listen , I 'm not quite ready to raise alarms , but ... - Sarah . - Yeah . - I know . I 've got some friends at Halton PD and they 're looking . She was tracking Castor , it just ... I don 't like it . I 'm going to go through everything again . Criminal databases , military records , known points of contact . Look , if there 's a trail , I 'm going to find it . SHE SIGHS - OK ? - Good man . - Yeah . DOOR SLAMS SHUT The mother wants to make medicine for the Mark-faced boys . Yeah , thank you for the warning . They took , like , a gallon of blood . You say they are our brothers ? - I do not believe . - No ? - Mmm-mmm . - I don 't care what you believe . You 're institutionalised . What does this word mean ? It means that you love it here . Don 't worry , I 'm sure they 'll make a nice little cage for your baby too . To a rat , a small hole is like a door . Have you figured a way out of here ? Eat your food , sestra . Oh , right , you 're the , uh ... You 're the hard scientist . Yes , I am annoying like that . Holistic healing , though . Like , tell me what that 's about , from your practice . I focus on nutrition , body work , spiritual counselling . You 're either in balance or not , and if not , I try to help you get there . CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING Plus , I can , uh ... - WHISPERING : - I can see inside your soul . My friend would totally , um , be shocked that I 'm doing this , but ... INHALES DEEPLY .. you want to go somewhere ? Hell , yes . Easy , son , easy . We cleaned and resutured the bullet wounds . We also redressed your arm . What happened ? I , uh , I burned it off , to prove my loyalty to the pastor . And that ? Also part of your cover ? I did what I had to to complete my mission . And you did . What 's her name ? Gracie . Pastor 's daughter . And you consummated this marriage ? Yeah . Just remember - it wasn 't real . She 's not one of us . Your first logbook . Any intimate contacts , their names go in . - FELIX : - I think there 's an old box with some of Sarah 's clothes in here . Yup . I doubt anything fits , though . I don 't blame you for not wanting me here . I wouldn 't trust me either . You know I sleep with men , right ? I 'm not stupid ! But as a Prolethean , you disapprove . I 'm not a Prolethean any more . Really ? And we 're just supposed to take your word for it ? Look ... All my life I 've had doubts , but I just let my parents tell me what to think and what to do . I 'm 18 years old and I 've never smoked anything or been to a rock concert or gone skinny-dipping . Brilliant . Let 's start with skinny-dipping . The shower 's down the hall . OK . Helena , how many men live on this base ? Approximately ... 11 million . SIGHS I know you . I know you 've counted them . DISTANT DOOR OPENS Five , four , three , two , one . DOOR UNLOCKS All you had to do was stay away . What 's this then , eh ? No uniform , no rank ? - I 'm a major , Sarah . - Yeah , I wouldn 't wear a uniform either if I was doing illegal shit . Come on , now . You are short on friends . Are you all right ? - Fat lot you care . - I do care . I was trying to keep you out of all this . HELENA SMOOCHES Hello , Dirty Paul . Hey ! You know what ? This is the guy who sold you out to S. You don 't believe me , you can piss off too . HELENA : Is this true , Paul ? It was either her or you . - SARAH : - So you 're a snake either way you cut it . Now , if you thought about it for one second , you 'd realise all I am doing for these men is what you do for your sisters . - Protecting them . - So they can assault women and abduct people ? That 's a hell of a cause . And Helena 's innocent ? How many people has she killed ? Just do the right thing . Let us go . That is out of my hands now . DOOR SLAMS SHUT The military is just another family , Sarah . Your genetic siblings are dying . Everything we do is for them . You tell yourself whatever you need to . HELENA : Opening up their heads ? I think Parsons would disagree . Second Lieutenant Parsons sacrificed what little life he had left for his brothers . He begged me to end it . You murdered him . And you destroyed months of data that could 've helped them . Maybe you 're next , Paul . - SARAH : - Yeah , Paul ! Maybe you 're next ! There 's some food downstairs , if you like . Thank you . CHUCKLES Look at those crazy kids of mine . Sarah looks so happy . Why wouldn 't she be ? I was always taught they were less than human . Abominations . But your father took Helena in . Because she was fertile . He thought she 'd been blessed by God . Fertile , infertile ... They 're all just people , love . Even your Mark . Though those Castor boys are no friends of ours . I don 't presume to know how you feel about losing the child ... Then don 't . My father put that baby inside me and my mother let him . What an awful thing . Why are you being so nice to me ? I was married young too . Eloped , much to the utter disappointment of my mother . My husband , John , was killed . Oh , my goodness . We were going to have a family . When my husband passed , I was adrift . Angry , but I couldn 't go back home . My Aunt Joan took me in , and she stopped me from self-destructing . So , I 'm your penance ? No . You 're my guest . I brought you Helena to keep Sarah off the table . She fell into our hands , Paul . - Sit . - We had the original Castor DNA , that is all you need to develop a cure . In theory . We still have to extract a viable sample from the bones . Will you sit , please ? These two sisters are unique . They offer alternatives . The time you bought us will save lives . And no harm will come to Sarah Manning , I promise . What are we doing , Virginia ? What we have to . Parsons knew that . COSIMA MOANS Oh , that 's it . Right there . - That 's your medius . - Mmm . That is some serious tightness . ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS You want to talk about the break-up ? " Loving is short . Forgetting is long . " - That 's beautiful . - Mmm . It 's Pablo Neruda . My mum made me read everything . - You OK ? - Mmm-hmm . Do you want me to go ? No . You want me to , um ... - WHISPERS : - ... stay ? I ... don 't know . I 'll go , OK ? Her name is Delphine . She and I worked together . And she 's French . Mostly just really great hair . Which is now in ... I find it in all my clothes and shit . I don 't know what I 'm doing , but you 're way more than I expected . WHIRRING Come on , Helena . I know you 're planning some kind of escape . I have no plan . I 'm institutionalised . SIGHS Come on . We 're surrounded by desert , yeah , so we 're in Mexico or something . Come on , talk to me . I can help . GRUNTS You want to be my sandwich ? - What ? - In Siberia , when planning escape , you take weak person with you . They 're called " sandwich " because you eat them . SHE LAUGHS You want to know why I left Kira with Mrs S ? Cos I was too young and I felt tied down and trapped . So , I would leave Kira with S for days on end . And one day , Mrs S wouldn 't let me see her . Why she does this ? Uh , cos I was high or hungover , or some shit . And she was right to do that . But ... I left town with Vic , just to show S what a mistake she 'd made . I missed nearly a year with my kid . Just being selfish . - VOICE BREAKING : - I didn 't get to watch her grow up . Or share her secrets . Or be her mum . So , you want to hold this stupid grudge , you go ahead . Fine with me . OK , Sarah . OK . But you have to help me . SHE SIGHS - FELIX : - Hey . You never told us John Sadler was killed . - You were eavesdropping ? - Yeah ! Wasn 't about to leave you alone with Rosemary 's Baby , was I ? Come on , S. SHE SIGHS DEEPLY He was a beautiful rebel . Also a fairly beautiful drunk . Had a habit of rubbing people the wrong way . There was a drunken fight , and he ended up with a pair of garden shears stuck in his throat . EXHALES Why didn 't you tell us ? Took me a long time to let go . I 'm in no rush to relive that pain . FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING Everything all right , chicken ? I 'm tired of being cooped up like one . - I 'm going out . - Oh , to a Victoria 's Secret fashion show ? To a club or something . I WAS going to ask you to come . FELIX LAUGHS Hang on just a minute , miss . You don 't even know where you 're going . Felix ! Wherever they drink mai-tais . Uh , whoa ! Hang on here , just one second . Um , do you know what ? I think that we could do with a plan . Yeah , a plan . I also think we could do with a cocktail . - That 's a great idea . - Yes . - SARAH : - Helena , what 's happening ? Any moment now . DISTANT DOOR UNLOCKS BOTH : Five , four , three , two , one ... DOOR UNLOCKS - Meal tray . - I 'm not done with it . Yes , you are . Put it through the slot . Why don 't you come in and get it ? SHE CHUCKLES Open it . Great , everybody come in . Go ahead . GRUNTING Ah-ah-ah . I don 't think so . I would suggest you show the brothers some respect . Make life easier on yourself . OK ? Cooperation is your friend . You can take her back now . What do you call this ? Gin and juice . Dressed to party , much like you . MUSIC : Let 's Shake by Teenage Head Come on , madam . You 've got to start somewhere . Can you hear it ? It 's in here , Gracie . Come on . And in here . OK . Feel it . Enjoy this . Come on . Felix , come and help us . Come on . OK . Let me show you how it 's done . OK . You want to twist . All right ? - Go , Gracie ! - OK , now bring them forward . - Felix ! - SHE LAUGHS It 's how it 's done . It 's a good look for you . - WHISPERING : - Hey ! Helena , it worked . Sarah , I think you were institutionalised too . Sorry I ever said that . OK , ready ? - SARAH : - Hide , hide ! Hide . All right . Good , good , good . Good girl , good girl .

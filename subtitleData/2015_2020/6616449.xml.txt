 What is that godforsaken thing ? Is it harming Sarah ? Apparently Neolutionists get them , like , voluntarily . If you had one to study , would that be helpful ? - Oh , Jesus . What is that ? - I think that 's what we need . I 'm glad you 're forming a bond with the child . Charlotte was cloned from you , you know . How do you even know she 's your sister ? She 's probably a Neolutionist plot . This means a lot to me . I 'm not just going to drop all my shit ' cause you 're short a sidekick . - Then you can piss off . - Why place it in the jaw ? - I don 't know . You tell me . - Proximity to the brain . Jesus . I need to get in touch with M.K. - What did she find out ? - She wouldn 't tell me . Is it something to do with those implant things ? - Beth said to hide . - Wait . Mika ! Sarah . New software . Crufty but anonymous . Look , Niki . Another puzzle piece . See , Niki ? We 're getting closer . Never forget ... This is how you treat someone who saved your skin ? We 've no intention of trusting you with the location of our safe house . Is all this really necessary ? Hmm ... Chef 's kitchen . Ho , ho , ho ! Is anyone hungry ? Kendall not joining us ? No ? - Kira ? - As long as you 're here , they will be safely somewhere else . We 've got one bit of business only . You said you could help me get this bot out of my face . Well , not me personally . But chin up . Susan Duncan is alive . And if we find her , surely she 'll have the answer to your ... situation . - And what is it you want ? - What he wants - is to rescue Rachel . - What can I say ? She pierced this armoured heart . Shall we breakfast ? The message from Rachel . I assume you can 't trace it . No , but you have a source who could . Do we ? Someone tipped you the Neos were in Iceland . Someone deep , or able to get deep . Am I right ? Share your source , and we 'll both have what we need . Insulated and fashionable . Yeah , that 's Alison for you . - Ready ? - Mm-hmm . - Oh , God . - That 's the head of Dyad . He never gave me a raise . Not once . Who 's the science now , bitch ? - Oh , boy . Look at that . - Yeah . The tumour 's living , but the surrounding tissue 's necrotic . It was feeding off him . Buried down there in the cold dirt under the Hendrix garage ... Oh , God . Alison and Donnie are total psychos , but this is a goldmine . Look , you can see the bot . It 's right there . I 'll biopsy the tumour , run a cell assay . - ' K. - Then we 'll open it up . Ah , la frittata . Go-to brunch for lazy lovers . Rachel 's a foodie too . And only a fluffy frittata - will she abide . - And here was I , thinking psychopaths incapable of genuine human connection . Nonsense . She seduced me , you know . Yeah , that figures . Rachel 's message , its origins masked by redirection through a series of proxy servers . And why do you think my contact can help with that ? - Let me convince them . - Felix is here . - Fee ? Why ? - Family meeting , love . I 'll reach out to my source , but you don 't get access . Benjamin , will you take Ferdinand and his frittata into the back room ? He can eat alone . No need for that . Two plates , Benjamin ? You know , I don 't think it 's as bad as you think . It is . It 's terrible . My name is mud at Glendale Community Theatre ... - No , no , not true . - We don 't need them . We 've always talked about doing our own musical revue . Alison , I would love to . ( both ) : ♪ Jesus Christ Superstar ♪ ♪ Do you think you 're what they say you ... ♪ - Shh ! - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ - ♪ Don 't get me wrong - Don 't you get me wrong now ♪ Oh , I have to go . Hot yoga , 10 minutes . No ... - Bye . - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ - ( giggling ) OK , see you soon . - Bye . - Bye . - ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ - What the hell is wrong with you ? You don 't recognize me ? It 's Trina , Beth . I specifically told you to drop it , and you went back to Club Neolution . You went to LifeSpring Fertility ? I , I didn 't ... I didn 't know . I told you I was a carrier in confidence . Why couldn 't you just let it go ? Wait ! Um , do you want to grab a coffee ? Cops . You think you can just fix everything with a cup of coffee ? Stay away from me ! I don 't know why you didn 't tell me . Well , you were very busy with your bio-sister ... If you had told me that you had some kind of a Neolutionist implant in your face ... OK . Now the air has been cleared . Sarah needs us right now . Felix , it 's absolutely fine for you to get to know Adele , but slowly . And you have to keep her clear of all of this . Yeah , fine . Of course . Fine . I hope you find what you 're looking for . Now , Cosima is analyzing the other bot , the one she ... Hey , Alison , you 're on speaker with S and Felix . I don 't want to talk about Dr. Leekie . - I bet you don 't . - Right now , I have something else . Who 's that ? She just accosted me at Aroma Café . She thought I was Beth . Isn 't that the same girl we were looking for at Club Neo ? She was upset . She said that Beth apparently investigated some IVF clinic she went to ... " LifeSpring Fertility " ? Right , and what 's that got to do with the bot implants ? She said she was a " carrier . " So maybe she has one of those things in her . Well , could you find out some more ? Maybe start with the clinic ? Sarah , I have budgets to review . - I 'm more of an idea person . - Jesus Christ , Alison , just pull your weight for once . Please . - Go to the clinic . - Hey , it 's fine . Alison , I 'll help . I 'll help you . - I 'll go with you . - Thank you . Well , I guess I have my orders . Call you in a bit , Felix . Hey . Well , would you look at that ? It 's a collage of babies . Yes , very cuddling . Mm . Do you think we could maybe , um ... Oh , I am making mess again . No , it 's not that . It 's Alison . I 'm not in the craft room . No , no , I know . I know . Um ... Listen , you probably didn 't know this , but before we adopted Oscar and Gemma , Alison and I tried to have our own kids . This was difficult for you . Yeah , very . It was the most difficult time of my life . But it was harder for Alison . She is jealous and angry , because me having babies and bringing the police . No , no ... Well , the police , yeah , maybe a little bit . We just need to tiptoe , try not to set her off . You 'll get used to it . Sorry . Good talk . Hey , honey . Yeah , sorry . You want me to meet you where ? Hey . Hey . Did M.K. get back to you ? After I told her about that implant in your jaw , yeah . That 's what this is about , isn 't it ? Unless it 's a booty call . She 's inside . - She 's here ? - She said just you . Don 't steal anything . Hello ? M.K. ? - Hello ? - Here , Sarah . You have three minutes . I need to know what these implants do . You knew Beth was investigating them . Yes . If she knew , she didn 't tell me . Well , I need help to get them out . You know Susan Duncan , yeah ? Yes , of course . She was one of our creators . Died September 1st , 1991 . Lab fire . Except she 's still alive . She 'll know how to get this implant out . This is a message from Rachel . Apparently Susan 's got her captive . - Rachel ... - I need you to trace it , - find out where they are . - Rachel contacted you ? No . Someone we trust . - Who ? - That 's my business , alright ? Ugh . I 'm so sick of pissing around . I need this thing out of my face . I 'm going straight to the top . Show me the specifics . Put it in the USB port . If I show you this , I want to meet in person . - I 'll put you in danger . - We 're all in danger , M.K. I 'll trace it and meet you in an hour . At Beth 's . Fitting . _ That is LifeSpring Fertility , and this is everything I 've learned about the place . Personnel profiles , services , floor plans ... Great job , hon . Clear , concise , colour-coordinated . - Thank you . - So let me sort this . We 're going to pose as prospective parents to determine if this is a Neolutionist front ? I 've already booked your appointment , and these - are your IDs . - Julian Gray ? - And Douglas Andrews . OK ? - This is good . - Did you use the new laminator ? - Mm-hmm . And these are real people with real medical records in case of a background check . OK ? Any sign of trouble , you get out . Wait , where 's yours ? Beth 's already been in there . I can 't go in . OK , then who 's the couple ? Oh , God , Donnie ... Oh ! - Hi . - Hi ! - Douglas and Julian for Dr. Lang . - Great . IDs , please ? Yes , of course . Right here . - Thank you . - It 's a terrible picture . - Just a moment . - Thank you . Oh , lord and butter , Donnie . Stop chewing the scenery . What the bloody hell are you doing ? - I 'm playing the part , darling . - No , darling , - you 're mincing . - I don 't know what that means . Donnie , do you have any gay friends ? - No . - Yes , you do . Science commonly holds the belief that 5 to 10 percent - of your male friends are gay . - Not in Bailey Downs . Especially in Bailey Downs . The point is you can 't tell , so don 't act gay . - OK . - OK . So while you 're waiting for the Doctor , I 'm just gonna get you started on some paperwork and a sperm sample . So who 's going to be the father ? I am . I guess we 'll just test you both . - OK , great . - Sure . That 's a lot of sperm . - OK ... - Oh ! Ah , thank you . Bad Puppy . My favourite ... - Here 's your sample cup . - Right . For the , um , sperm . Thanks , Jill . You 're coming along fine , Portia . Make sure you take ... Portia Grossman 's pregnant ? No way . No . No , no , no . The Grossmans gave up on IVF years ago . - We discussed adoption with them . - I know , honey , but she 's five or six months along , easy . You let me deal with Portia . Is there anything else you need ? I 'm in this little room all by myself , and I need to , you know ... Masturbate ? Well , I think I could use a little " Air Italia " to help me along . Donnie , I 'm in a public place ! I know , but you asked me what I need , and , um ... That 's what I need , - Ms. Hendrix . Sir , you have to put on your seat belt . Hold on , hold on . Uh ... Si , I know , ma 'am , but I 'm having trouble doing up the buckle . Take a look . Si , ooh , it 's ... grande , molto duro . - Very duro . - You best to come with me - to thelavatore . - Please , take me to the lavatore . Is that your leaning tower ? It 's not leaning anymore . I got two spicy meatballs for you , baby . So spicy ! Oh , it is so tight ... in this ... airplane lavatory ... - I am arriving ! I am landing ! - Si , claro , claro ! Oh , no ! No ! Aah ! Unreal . No scolex . No cerebral ganglion . It 's got a synthetic core . I 'm not even - sure we could say it 's alive . - The question is what does it do ? And why did Leekie have one ? She started showing symptoms three weeks ago . I can read , thank you . And is she the youngest subject to develop symptoms ? She is . She doesn 't know , does she ? - No . - And has Susan considered immunosuppressive therapy for her ? That treatment induced rapid onset in Jennifer Fitzsimmons . It was torture . Yes . But Charlotte is prepubescent . Her hormone levels are lower , and her auto-immune response might be easier to ... to control . I 'll bring it up with Susan . Look , Niki . Susan Duncan , guardian of Rachel . A ghost all these years , like me . Where are you hiding ? Ping , ping , ping ... Rachel 's hidden deep . Who 's she reaching out to ? You . So you are Ferdinand . Who is this mysterious source of Sarah 's ? Insider ? Outsider ? I 've been racking my brains . Biscuit ? I admire you , Siobhan . I 'd like a family of my own , someday . I 've squirreled a little away . Enough to recover by the seaside in style . Just Rachel and I. Bide our time before a slow , steady climb back to power . Interesting definition of family . All our dreams rest with Sarah now , don 't they ? M.K. ? I 'm here . M.K. ? You said you 'd meet me in person . - He 's Topside . - What ? Rachel 's contact . He did their wet work , their cleaning . - Is he your source ? - Yeah , I made a decision . Sometimes you have to work with people you don 't like . No , we don 't . No , we don 't . Look , Mika , I will do anything . I 'll deal with anyone to get this implant out of my face . - Did you find Susan Duncan ? - We 're finished . I can 't trust you now . - Oh ! - Oh , sorry . - Alison ! - Portia ! Oh , no , what 's wrong ? Oh ! - Oh , sweetie . - Can we talk ? So we wanted to try one more time , but the doctor just told me , no go . Oh , Ali , I 'm so sorry . Did you and Jacob ... forgive me ... but did you try something special ? Did you do some , I don 't know , new technology or ... ? I mean , I 'd do anything . I 'd pay anything . Ali . Oscar and Gemma are such amazing kids . Oh , yes . And I love them so much , I really do . I just ... You know , I 'm getting older , and everybody 's pregnant , and ... I just want to have my own baby . Ali ... You know what ? Maybe you should go back in there . See Dr. Bosch . Ask for the " Brightborn Treatments . " - OK ? - OK . Thank you . - And are you married ? - Yes , though some of us don 't always wear our wedding rings . It 's because some of us don 't need our rings to feel secure in our relationship . Well , we should have the test results in a few days . Do you have an egg donor in mind ? - Yes . - Not yet . We are still narrowing it down . - Yeah . You know , we should tell you , too , that we are thrilled to be working with you . And we are both very open to any kind of emerging technologies . You two are healthy young men . I doubt you 'll have any problems conceiving . Dr. Bosch , we were told to ask for you specifically . - Oh ? - And to ask about the Brightborn Treatments ? How did you hear about Brightborn ? From a very satisfied customer . Jill ... could you bring in some Brightborn packages ? - Hey . - Hey . M.K. didn 't show . If M.K. shut you down , I 'm sure she had good cause . I 'm out of options , Dizzy . I need you to help me find her . You keep banging on my door , asking for favours . You ever think about what I might want ? - Alright , what ? - I need to know exactly what 's going on between you and this twin of yours . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . - Why ? - I have my reasons . I 've got people wrapped up in this too . OK , fine . Clones . We 're clones . Jesus . Genetic identicals . How many others are there out there - in this little " experiment " ? - 22 that we know of , including M.K. 9 of us still living . - Do you believe me ? - I don 't know . Well . True or not , makes for a great story . Listen , I 've met with M.K. three times in person , and each time she had different plates on her car . - What 's that about ? - Exactly . I cracked the DMV , ran those plates , and wouldn 't you know it , but they 're all defunct . What 's that tell you ? She 's got access to scrapped cars ? She once told me she worked as a night watchman . Three scrapyards in the city . That one 's closest to Beth 's . - Who 's Beth ? - Save that for later . Listen , you 're gonna want me to come with you . - Why would I want that ? - Given the right circumstances , I think she could be dangerous . Little science babies , forgive me . I did not know to feed you liquid nitrogens . But your twins are in my belly , and when they are old , I will tell them all about you and our adventures . Goodbye , family Hendrix . - There . That 's gotta be it . - What , this thing ? If she 's here , I 'm sure she already knows we 're here . Mika ? Mika ! - Screw this . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . A little messier than my usual approach . - Whoa , whoa . Wait , wait . - What ? Look at this . See the mat ? That 's a pressure plate bomb . You step on that , - the whole place goes up . - Jesus . Kinda makes you wonder what she 's hiding . Herself . Careful . We need to find whatever she knows about a doctor called Susan Duncan . She can remove the bot . Password . Yeah . I 'll need a few minutes . OK . The pigment is coming along . In a few weeks , the tech will be invisible . How are you feeling , Charlotte ? Why do you keep asking that ? Another message . Will you please go play in your room , Charlotte ? Maybe someday , I 'll be allowed to visit you there . Yours is nicer . I 'm willing to consider immunosuppressive therapy for her . You 're no closer to finding the Original , then , are you ? There is one other option for Charlotte . Do you know what it is ? She 's the youngest subject to fall ill . Untreated , her dataset could be of value to the rest of us . - Including Ira . - And what would you do ? Let the disease advance , or intervene ? Is this a test ? It 's a decision . One of many we have to make every day . M.K ... I 'm in . You said she was tracking someone named Susan Duncan ? - Yeah . - Looks like , most recently , M.K. was tracking you . - What ? - Phreaking your phone . Texts , calls , locations . What are you doing , M.K. ? I know you want to protect Sarah 's source , but motivating people to share information quickly is my speciality . We have our own tactics , thank you . Should have brought me with her . I 'd be out of your hair . Sarah . She wants you to meet her at Beth 's . She 's found something . _ Kind of annoying , Scottie . Uh . I think you 're gonna want to see this . Dude , are you , like , hella baked or what ? Just check this out . Oh , shit . Bioluminescence ? Green fluorescent proteins . They must be using them as markers to track gene expression . So the bot 's introducing foreign DNA ? And it seems like , because the host died , it 's - all congregating in the tumour . - I bet that 's why Leekie had one . It 's some kind of gene therapy delivery system . Could be changing Sarah 's DNA . Sarah ? Sarah ? Over here . Behind you . Well , hello there . And you are ... ? Friend of Sarah 's . How apropos . Sarah 's deep throat is a sheep . I have information about Susan Duncan and Rachel . That is excellent news . Now , let 's take off the mask , shall we ? I would not stand up if I were you . Whatever this is , it 's not necessary . Oh , yes , it is . Hello , Ferdinand . What 's your name ? Hm ? I should know you , but I don 't . - I know you . - Is that right ? Yes . Ferdinand Chevalier . Bastard son of the 10th Earl of Sussex . A stigma you still can 't get over . Well , I wouldn 't go that far , but top marks for presentation . You discovered your bloodlust in the British SAS . Learned to kill quickly and quietly . Perfect recruit for a Topside cleaner . If she found anything on Susan Duncan , she scrubbed it already . We should really get out of here , Sarah . Try " Neolution . " Or ... - " Rachel Duncan . " - Yes , ma 'am . Helsinki ... Is that where M.K. ' s from ? Does this ring a bell ? That 's a Scandinavian accent , isn 't it ? Finland , maybe ? I always suspected one clone escaped the purge . Hello , Veera Suominen . " Veera Suominen . " Let me guess . Her name isn 't M.K. and neither one of those girls is you . They must have found each other , or were put together on purpose . " Niki . " Niki . She was my only friend . This was a week before she was killed . Just met her boyfriend Alecks . Just began her life . You gassed her family . You burned her alive . Jesus . I know what she 's doing . S , I need to talk to Ferdinand . He 's with you , isn 't he ? At Beth 's ? - What ? - Oh , God . That text wasn 't from you . - I need your car . - I 'll come with . No , no , no . I need to go alone , please . You serious ? I must be out of my mind . Hey , Sarah ? Not a great time , Cosima . OK , but I think we figured out what the bots do . Let me guess. it 's bad news . I understand . This is your revenge fantasy . You 've been playing it in your head for years . You killed six of my sisters . Murdered 32 of our friends and loved ones . What 's stopping me from standing up and killing one more ? You tell me ! Cowardice ? Narcissism ? Rachel ? Rachel . She was hidden deep . You found her ? I found you first . Sarah handed you to me . I always dreamed of putting a name to your face . Of hurting you like you hurt me . What are you doing ? Veera ? Veera ! - That 's not my name anymore . - Ah ! Stop ! Stop ! Ah ! Holy shit . Sarah , talk some sense into her , please . What are you doing , Mika ? - I think you know . - There 's a bomb under my chair . You can 't do this . I need him . He needs to pay for what he did to Niki . I know , alright ? I know about Helsinki . Did Beth ? Did you tell her what happened to you ? - No . She was too fragile . - I 'm not . Alright ? I 'm not going to back down . I want revenge too , but we 're not going to do it like this . For me , it is this . Mika . Hey , look . Look , look , look . The guy is garbage . I know , I know . But he saved my life . Oh , it 's true . That 's a good point . The bots , Mika ? Mika , the bots . We know what they do . Some kind of gene editing . It could be changing my DNA . I need all the help I can get , alright , and Ferdinand is an asset . Do you understand that ? Listen to her . It 's true . It 's true . I can help you . - I 've got money . - Yes . 3.7 million . I sifted through your shell companies . Traced your wire transfers . Password . " Corn cob . " Two words . Enter it . I will find you . I will finish Helsinki . What , you 're just going to leave now ? Yes . If you were smart , you would leave too . You used me . You pulled me out of Iceland and you threw me in the middle of this shit . And now you 're just going to blow it all up ? - Get out of here , Sarah . - No . Your friend Niki died . Beth died . What about our sisters that are still alive ? I ... I 'm sorry . Two wires . Battery . Plastic explosives . - Taped together pretty well . - And you 're absolutely certain there 's only one circuit ? - Far as I can see . - You and me , we 're even now . You understand ? You saved me and I saved you . I 'm going to cut this wire , and leave the building . Then , and only then , are you going to stand up . Am I clear ? Just give me a moment , because if there 's more than one circuit , the whole thing could just ... Dammit , Siobhan ! Let me prepare myself . Alright , alright . I 'm sure this whole thing is going to be fine . But when I get out of here , I 'm going be a little short of funds ... You 're a clever chap . I 'm sure you 'll find some way to make yourself useful . Come in . No one 's ever knocked before . My opinion on Charlotte 's treatment couldn 't wait till morning ? Well ? Immunosuppressive therapy likely won 't save her . Untreated , her data has value , more value than her life . We shouldn 't intervene . That 's what you wanted to hear , isn 't it ? I need to go away again . Why ? Have you found Sarah ? Kendall ? We know you contacted Ferdinand . As you wish , we won 't treat Charlotte . You 're right to think of the future . This stuff from Dr. Bosch better be worth it . Let 's see what creepy Brightborn is all about . Are you having difficulty conceiving ? Are you in a non-traditional relationship , seeking to have a child on your terms ? Perhaps you have genetic risk factors ... I 've totally seen that woman before . - I think she was on Oprah . - here at Brightborn Technologies , we can help . I 'm Evie Cho , CEO and founder of the Brightborn Group . We can help provide you and your family with the best chance at a fast conception , a smooth pregnancy , and a healthy and thriving newborn . But why stop there ? Mainstream reproductive technology ?

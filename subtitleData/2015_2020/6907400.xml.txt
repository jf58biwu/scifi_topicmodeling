 Evening , gents . Good evening . _ Hello , there . Good evening . Well , it is now . What can I do for you , mister ? If I could trouble you for a moment of your time . You a doctor ? I am . And do you like it ? Has its moments . Do you like what you do ? Has its moments . Well , socialism tends to do that . But it the path man must inevitably tread , or we are all doomed . It is the only path to utopia . You have too much time on your hands , Wells . Perhaps you should think about dating again . You can 't stay divorced forever . That 's what I 've been telling him . I consider myself single , not divorced , if you must brand me . And , yes , I can stay single forever . I find it far more desirable than the suffocating effects of marriage . You see , that is precisely what love is supposed to do ... suffocate . If you read a poem now and then instead of science books , you 'd know that . Poetically speaking , I believe the exact opposite . To love is to exhale fully , knowing that even if it were your last breath , you 're complete because you had found the very reason for your existence . I knew you were a romantic ! Dr. Stevenson . - Mrs. Nelsen . - Good evening . - May I take your coat ? - Thank you . John ! You 're here . I had you almost written off . A doctor 's hours are not his own , I 'm afraid . - Good evening , gents . - John ! Right . Now that we 're all here , let 's get on with it . By now you all know my obsession with time travel . Oh , yes , how is your novel coming ? Have you finished it yet ? You could say I 'm in the research phase . And how does one research time travel ? He constructs a time machine and travels through time . So , your book is nonfiction . So , where is this time machine ? - See here . - Oh , please . All right . Good lord , Wells ! You actually built the bloody thing . How much have you spent on it ? How is this thing supposed to work ? You set the time and date with the dials on the board . The solar cylinders yield enough energy to compress the machine into subatomic particles , resulting in the thermodynamic suspension of molecular activity , which allows it to journey across the fourth dimension from one time sphere to the other . I 'm genuinely concerned for your sanity . You 've taken this too far . And once you leave , can you come back ? We don 't want him back . The safety lock automatically returns the machine to its starting date , unless you have this key to countermand the device . Have you taken it for a test-run ? I 'm doing some final tests now . I think that 's enough . - More drinks . - No , this is getting ... He 's lost his mind . So , where to ... the past or the future ? Well , the future , or course , away from all you cynics . In five generations , utopia will have come to pass . - And that 's where I belong . - Ah , yes , your utopia . Where mankind lives in peace with no war , no crime , no disease or famine . It 's inevitable . Science and technology will advance beyond all imagination , forcing society to perfect itself . You 're a surgeon , John . Think of what the future holds for medicine . Think of the cures . Health and happiness will be the daily course . Mankind will finally know true equality . Mankind hasn 't changed in 200 years . We 're animals . We hunt . We 're hunted . That 's the way it has been and always will be . The future will prove you wrong . Very well . Let 's go , right now . Let 's take it for a whirl . Well , I-I still have a few tests that I need to conduct . - Scared to try it out ? - Hardly . H.G. , I 've known you for years . You have all these brilliant ideas - that only find life on the page . - I 'm a writer , John . I fail to see how that makes me a coward . All you do is write ! It 's the only release your fear grants you . You write about life without actually living it . In your opinion . Imagine who you could be if you didn 't live in fear . Or more importantly , imagine the stories you could write if your life were full of adventure . You might finally get that novel published . Excuse me , Mr. Wells ? Scotland Yard is at the door . What is going on ? The Ripper has struck . A woman was found in an alley near here . We 're conducting a house-to-house search . - Absolutely . Wh-whatever you need . - Pardon me , sir . - I apologize , my friends . - It 's getting ... I think we best be off . My men will see them home safely . Where is Dr. Stevenson ? He left his bag . No , he was just here . - Allow me . - Excuse me ! That 's the personal property of a prestigious surgeon ! I believe surgeons use scalpels , not butchers ' knives . Where is the doctor ? - I last saw him in the basement . - It 's empty . - There 's nobody down there . - Well , he couldn 't of gone far . Quickly , comb the streets ! This time machine was unearthed 15 years ago in the basement in H.G. Wells ' London flat . It was restored , and is on loan from Anders Enterprises . It 's believed to have served as inspiration for Wells ' first novel , " The Time Machine . " Somebody 's getting out . Look . Hey ! _ Sit here . Don 't move . I 'm in America . Hey , Willy . - Good afternoon . - Loving this ... this whole look . Can you check online to see if any of this has gotten out ? Please , sit . Oh ! So , really , who are you ? Well , it 's rather complicated . Perhaps it 's best I speak to someone in charge . Jane Walker , assistant curator . Assistant . Is the actual curator in ? May I speak with him ? It 's a she , too , but keep digging your grave . Of course ! Things have changed a great deal since 1893 ! I can no longer make social and cultural assumptions . My apologies . - May I keep this ? - Okay , so , really , who are you ? It 's apparent , isn 't it ? It 's some publicity stunt ... yeah . What is it , some stage play about H.G. Wells in the Village somewhere ? Is it opening night tonight ? I beg your pardon ? How did you get past the sensors and inside the actual exhibit ? I 'm certain you won 't believe the answer to that question . I think you want to get arrested . You get arrested , make some news , you got free press for whatever the little avant-garde production you 're involved with . Oh , I can assure you , I am not an actor . Right ! You are H.G. Wells . Yes . - You wrote " The Time Machine . " - Well , no , not yet , I haven 't . But apparently I 'm published , which is incredibly exciting to learn . Look , I can appreciate this on some level , but no . You will not be getting arrested today . There will be no free press , despite the fact I like you better than the other guy . - What other guy ? - Your friend ? Popped out of the time machine with the same period getup . Wasn 't nearly as polite , by the way . This other gentleman , where is he ? So , a few tourists posted pics on Twitter on Instagram , but so far , no news outlets have picked it up . Great . Mr. Wells , this is where we say goodbye . Please , the other man ? He hasn 't broken character once . It 's pretty amazing . Please , I must find him . No one here is a amused by your fake accent and costume . If I catch you within spitting distance of this museum , you will prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . - Do you understand ? - It is urgent that I find this man . Willy , will you please escort this man out ? No . No , please . I beg of you . Come on , let 's go . - Please , I must find this man ! - This way . Come on . Eh , the other one was hotter . I like this one . He 's cute . He really does look like him . Please , the gentleman who was here earlier ... - When was it ? What time ? - About an hour ago . Did he say anything ? Where he might be going ? Said he wanted to explore the city , see the sights , asked about a hotel , so I sent him to the Renaissance in Times Square . Renaissance in Times Square . Brilliant . Where is that ? Out these doors , turn right , walk uptown 50 blocks . You can 't miss it . Thank you . And may I remark how happy I am to see that race relations have improved since 1893 . - Uh-huh . - I knew that one day , the color of a man 's skin would dissipate and we would all live side by side as brothers . Oh , yeah , we 're all one big happy family . What are you , in " Les Mis " ? I don 't think so . Patek Philippe . Yellow gold . This is a real collector 's item . I can give you $ 12,000 . It belonged to my father . I 'll accept nothing less than $ 20,000 . $ 15,000 cash . We skip the paperwork . Deal . I 'll need a credit card and an I.D. I have a tragic predicament . I 'm in town for a show , you see , and I 've lost my luggage and identification papers . All I have is this ridiculous costume . Oh , that 's just horrible . Did the airlines lose your bags ? It appears so , yes . I have money , but ... that 's all , I 'm afraid . Let me speak to my supervisor . We can usually work something out . Did you lose your luggage , too ? You ... you saw him ? Where is he ? He wanted to do some shopping , so we sent him over to 5th Avenue . 5th Avenue ? Right , and where is that ? You 'll never find him . Why don 't you wait for him at the hotel bar ? He shouldn 't be long . I 'll send him over as soon as he arrives . Thank you . It 's wet ! Look , there 's water all over the floor . It 's literally soaking wet . Why ? The tour guide said it was like this . He couldn 't explain it , either . Ms. Walker ? Doug Lawson , head of security for Anders Enterprises . I understand there was a breach in the Wells Exhibit today ? Not exactly a breach , no . Then what was it ? Ms. Walker , this is Vanessa Anders . Yes , of course . Ms. Anders , it is such an honor and a pleasure to meet you . We were informed that there were two men caught inside the time machine . It was a slight breach . But I can assure you , the exhibit was not harmed in any way . Can we see the police report ? We chose not to involve the police . It was a minor incident , and the last thing we wanted was to call attention to it . Did you get their information ? Where can we find them ? I don 't have that . I realize how this looks . But in my defense , most infractions are harmless . And it 's not our policy to arrest guests at the museum . As owner of this exhibit , I find that answer unacceptable . You need to find these men , Ms. Walker , or I 'll see to it that Anders Enterprises files charges against you and the museum . Do you understand ? 12 dead in latest school shooting ... We need to build a wall ... - The suicide bomber ... - ... A mass execution . This is weapons that are so destructive ... that the world could end . ... Attacks killed 14 ISIS fighter ... ISIS is the worst of the worst . His next target will probably be ... - ... Too many nuclear weapons ... - Anarchists ... Well , bless my soul . Literally the last person on Earth I expected to see . Something to drink , sir ? Whiskey , neat , and another of whatever he 's drinking . So ? What do you think ? I know ... I look absolutely dashing . I must applaud you . I never thought your little device would actually work . How did you find me ? - The details aren 't important . - Yeah , I suppose not . I wasn 't sure the machine would return to you . Then I realized I didn 't have the key . To you , the Columbus of a new age . Mm . Tell me , how did you muster the courage to phone me . I 'm not here to engage in idle banter , John . - We must be off . - Oh . - And where are we going ? - To the time machine . I 'm obliged to take you back to Scotland Yard to face the consequences of your actions . So Victorian . You 'll take me back ? And how do you propose to do that , by force ? Be reasonable , John . You must pay for what you 've done . You can 't stay here . We don 't belong here . There it is , H.G. There 's your utopia . Nothing but violence and bloodshed . Not quite what you envisioned . " We don 't belong here " ? On the contrary ... I belong here completely . In our time , I was a freak . Today , I 'm an amateur . Stop it , John , this instant . You know you can walk into a shop here and purchase a rifle or a revolver , and it 's perfectly legal ? These people encourage it . No , I 'm not going anywhere . I 've yet to begin in this age . It 's you who should run along back to your timid life . Of course , I 'll be needing the key . Well , I can 't have you chasing after me across centuries . Who knows where I might want to venture to next ? Well , I don 't have it with me . Herbert George , come on . I 've played countless games of chess with you , and the one thing you cannot do is bluff . I want that key . Now , what you feel ... is a four-inch steel curved blade with a reverse grip . Rather expensive at $ 69.95 , but I 'm certain I 'll get my money 's worth . What are you doing ? Everyone can see . And no one cares ! Isn 't it glorious ? Give me the key , or I 'll slice into your femoral artery . You 'll topple to the floor and bleed out , and I will disappear before anyone blinks twice . Hey ! Are you all right , man ? Right in front of my cab . Step away , sir . Ambulance is on the way . Don 't move . How ya doin ' ? How 's your head ? It hurts . Um , may I ask , where am I ? Manhattan General . You 're lucky you just suffered a slight concussion is all . I 'll let the doctor know you 're awake , and you have a friend on the way . A friend ? What friend ? No wallet , no I.D. All I had was a business card to call . - Ms. Walker ! - Hi . Um , are you okay ? The hospital called , and I tried to explain that we just met . - What happened ? - A big yellow motorcar ran me down . You were hit by a taxi ? What is that ? That is a key that I thought I 'd lost . Ooh . Here , let me help you . Thank you . Please level with me . I 'm in a lot of trouble . The time machine exhibit is my responsibility , and I don 't wanna lose my job . Who are you ? Very well . - My name is Sigmund ... - Don 't say " Freud . " ... Kemp . Uh , and you were correct . I ... I am an actor . And I am playing H.G. Wells in a small production about his life . I am sorry about what happened at the museum earlier . So , you 're an actor , you 're from London , and this is all just a big prank ? Yes . - Anything else ? - No . We 're good . Well , thanks for blowing up my day . It 's been most stressful and inconvenient , but ... I hope you feel better . Again , my sincerest apologies . Thank you . And break a leg . It 's all a stunt , like I said . Call that creepy guy from Anders Enterprises and tell him it 's much ado about nothing . No , the second one ... cute one . Okay , I 'm going home . Call me if something explodes . Can you just wait here one second ? Hey . Are you okay ? Oh . Just a little light-headed is all . - Oh ! - Where are you going ? Did the hospital release you ? I really must find my friend . I really think you should rest . Do you have anywhere to go ? I-I-I 'm fine , thank you . Okay , here . Let me help you . Come on . Oh , no , I 'm not getting into that . Oh , no , you 'll be fine . You 'll be fine . Come on . Yes , Herbert George Wells . He was struck by a ... Can you hear me ? Hello ? Yes . Yes , he was struck by a motor vehicle in Times Square . No , this is the third hospital I 've called . Yes , I 'll hold . Easy . - Oh , this is lovely ! - Thank you . So , do you live alone ? Maybe . Oh no , you 're perfectly safe with me , Ms. Walker , I promise . Okay , well , you can freshen up and rest some , but then you have to leave because my stray-puppy-dog syndrome only goes so far . Are you hungry ? Oh , yes , thank you . So , how does one become a museum curator ? When one has to pay the rent . I majored in art history because I absolutely loved it , but I really didn 't think it through in terms of careers . It 's not forever . I hope you like Chinese . So , I take it that you 're single . Yes . Um , this is from last night . What about you ? I 'm divorced . Do men and women even fancy marriage today ? You mean in America ? Yes , we fancy marriage , particularly my mother . She wants grandkids yesterday , but she doesn 't understand that the benchmark for that stuff has changed . I 'm still in my first career . I can have kids when I 'm 50 . So , you prefer being single . Yeah . Not always . But apparently , I 'm too mediocre to date . Excuse me ? One of the joys of online dating . You 'd be surprised what guys say when they don 't have to say it to your face . A man said that to you ? Well , what he said exactly was that I was " curiously unspecial and intriguingly mediocre . " That 's appalling ! He was a wanna-be songwriter who talked in bad lyrics . Any man who says that to a lady is no gentleman . Which is why I quit Tinder . But , I mean , it does have some truth to it . I moved to New York to have this crazy , exciting life . And that hasn 't materialized yet , so , yeah ... you could say my life is pretty unspecial at the moment . You haven 't eaten . - Would you like something to drink ? - Oh . - Let 's get you something to drink . - Thank you . Is the music always this loud ? Yeah . You wanna dance ? I can think of a few things I 'd like to do . I found some clothes from my ex . It ended quickly , and he never came back for his stuff . You can shower and freshen up in here . Hot water takes a minute . Razor , deodorant , and toothbrush . Thank you . Enjoy your shower . Aah ! - Oh ! What ... - Oh ! uh , what ... what happened ? I was attempting to use your razor , but it 's more complicated than it looked . Well , it 's old . It 's from my ex-boyfriend . Here , let me help you . Why is he your ex-boyfriend ? He wasn 't the one . Truth is , I 'm the problem . I 'm a bad picker . I always end up with the wrong guy . And why is that ? Because I don 't trust anyone , ever . And then I realize I don 't trust anyone , so I try to . And then , I end up trusting the wrong one . It never fails . Are all women today as self-aware as you ? No , I 'm the only one . They gave me an award and everything . I find you fascinating , Ms. Walker . I should let you finish . These trousers are ill-fitting . Nah , you 're good , you 're good . Yep . Okay , you can stay the night . No , I really must find my friend . How far is the Renaissance Hotel ? It 's too far to walk . You really should rest up . Let your body heal . You can find him tomorrow . I 'll be off first thing in the morning . I must say , this reprieve really has been my salvation . And I thank you for your kindness , Ms. Walker . It 's a Christmas gift from my dad . I 'm from Texas . Sleep tight . Aah ! Oh . Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no . ♪ Get your both hands up ♪ ♪ Sing it with me now ♪ In international news ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't ... ♪ Yeah , buddy ... ♪ Want some coffee ? Uh , no , thank you . What are your plans for today ? I must find my friend . The museum 's closed , so I have the day off if you need any help . How do you feel ? - Much better , thank you . - Good . How do I get to the Renaissance Hotel ? Are you sure he 's even there ? Have you tried calling him ? Here ... use my phone . Okay , I got it . Sorry . Renaissance Hotel in Times Square . What 's his name ? John Stevenson ... Dr. John Stevenson . A guest , please ... Dr. John Stevenson ? They 're working with Utopia ... - Utopia ? - Thank you . He checked out last night . The victim was last seen at the popular night club Utopia . She was found nearby stabbed several times . Bizarrely , a set of keys was found in her mouth . The murder appears to have been random , though the victim 's purse was found ... He killed ! Coward ! Who killed ? John , the man I 'm looking for ... Dr. John Stevenson . He 's killed many women in London , and now he 's in New York . I have to find him . Uh , maybe you should call the police . And tell them what ? That the Ripper has escaped 1893 in my time machine and travelled to New York City ? They 'll think I 'm mad . - Do you mean Jack the Ripper ? - Yes . And now he 's killed again . Utopia is a reference to me . The keys in her mouth ... That 's a message to me . He wants the key ... this key . Jack the Ripper lived over 100 years ago . I lied . I 'm not an actor . Just , please , look at this key . Surely as a museum curator , - you can see that this is a relic . - That doesn 't prove anything . You asked me how I was able to get into the machine . - Yes ! - Because it was in my basement in 12 Mornington Lane in London , where I live . - In 1893 ? - Yes . You seem so sane in so many ways . Please , I need your help . If I don 't stop him , he will keep killing . If you know who killed that woman , then you need to go to the police ! They won 't believe me . You don 't . Jane . What if I can prove to you that I 'm telling the truth ? Then we can both go to the police together . Grant me access to the time machine . I 'll prove it to you . Watch your step . You know , I could get in a lot of trouble for this . I didn 't anticipate passengers . Sorry . Um ... Right . Now , I say we do a short trip . Say , three days from now . It 's over 123 years old with no power source . But , hey , I can sit here all day . We 're still here . Yes . But it is three days later . This exhibit doesn 't open for three days . That would be today . How is this possible ? I 'll give you a moment to process . Is this really happening ? Are you really H.G. Wells ? Flesh and blood . I must seem so different to you , so inappropriate . You 're from Victorian England . I ate with my hands . What is it like to be here in this time ? I 'm dazzled , astonished . I 'm also profoundly disappointed . I envisioned a society that was entirely different . Yeah , I-I think we all did . It 's not without its beauty , though . I must take issue with something that you said earlier . There is absolutely nothing mediocre about you . I find you , Jane Walker , particularly special . You okay ? Yes . I 'm just breathing . So , you haven 't written " The Time Machine " yet . Started it , several times . I haven 't quite figured it out yet . What about the others ? " The Island of Dr. Moreau , " " The Invisible Man , " " The War of the Worlds " ? I write for the London Gazette . Trust me , you write a lot of books . It 's nice to know I 'm inspired . I can 't believe this is real . What 's wrong ? _ - So , I die three days from now . - I will fix this . - I promise . - How ? We can 't go to the police . They 'll never believe us . The paper said that you were the third victim . Who 's the second victim ? There was the woman at Utopia , but we 're missing a victim . Uh , second victim . " Kerry Ann Riley was found on the roof of the Palace nightclub . " Security footage puts her inside the club with an unidentified man " at 11 : 30 three nights ago . " Three nights ago ... that 's tonight . What time is it ? It 's 10 : 30 . I 'll go to the club , and I 'll stop him . What are you doing ? Google . Internet search . This is her . She 's 23 . - She 's pretty . - Haven 't much time . You 'll need a gun . There will be no violence ! The man who raises his fist first is the man out of ideas . Yeah , that 's all very nice , but you need a gun . We have to hurry . How do we get to the roof ? Come on . This way . John ! John , who is that ? - My dear . - No , let ... let her go . Stay back . I remember you . The girl from the museum . Clever . Clever , H.G ... . attempting to change the future . That can prove very dangerous . What 's dangerous is allowing you to go on killing with impunity . - Now , let her go . - Where is the key ? - Where is it ? - I have it . It 's ... it 's here . Uh ... Let her go ! Finally , you rise to the occasion . - I didn 't think you had it in you . - Let her go , now . Go downstairs and get help . Go , go go ! It 's catching , isn 't it ... violence ? It really has infected this world . Are you really willing to kill me , and violate everything that you stand for ? You don 't belong in this time , or any time . Then do it . Do it . Do it ! Over here ! Help ! Please ! Somebody help us ! - I want that key . - Up here ! This way ! - You okay ? - Yeah . Are you okay ? Oh , my God . You need stitches . Please , let me take you to the hospital . No , I 'm ... I 'm fine . This could get infected . You need antibiotics . Don 't be stupid . It 's too late for that , I 'm afraid . Stupidity 's become my dominant trait . Hey . I think you did pretty well tonight . You saved that girl , which means you saved me . Did I ? There will be others . This is a sport to him , and he 's taunting me with it . I must find him . We will find him . We ? Absolutely not . This is my problem , and I will no longer put you in danger . I can take care of myself . Take two of these with some food . I 'll be right back . Aah ! Jane ? Jane ? Jane ? _ Oh , no . Hello , Mr. Wells . Who are you ? How do you know my name ? We have a lot to talk about . No , I have to find Jane . She was just here . - John took her . - You mean the Ripper took her . - How do you know that ? - Because you told me . I 'll explain everything , but we need to go now . I-I don 't know you ! But you will . I 'm Vanessa . I 'm your great-great-granddaughter .

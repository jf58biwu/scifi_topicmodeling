 Previously on " the 100 " ... Octavia : There are consequences , bell . Lincoln is dead . We bring you chancellor pike of the sky people . Where are you taking him ? To the new commander . May I join you ? Luna , we 're on our way . Nightblood . Luna has it . That 's why we have to find her . If she can access alle 2- - then she can tell us how to stop alle 1 . Jaha is using the chips to control everyone . The more minds turned to the task , the more powerful alle becomes . Abby : Now that arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to stage two . Jaha : What we 're doing is too important , and we won 't be done until everyone is with us . About what i expected . Shut your mouth . Kane : Hey ... We should leave . Think you 're gonna find peace with the new commander ? Go on . Move . Chancellors . Jackson ? What the hell are you doing here ? Those aren 't necessary . This man belongs to the commander . It 's all right , Jackson . Mm . Thelonious , what is this ? This is the chip . I thought you were crazy . Now I know you are . This is unity , like you always wanted . Everyone back away , or the commander dies . Thank god . Briggs , Grant , get behind me . Uh ! Huh huh huh ! Rrgh ! Uh ! Briggs ! You 're farm station . Rrgh ! There are no stations here , just the city of light . Join us , Charles , please . There 's no more need for fighting . We both know there 's no way in hell I 'm taking that thing . Sorry it has to be this way . Pike : No ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! No . How about you , Marcus ? We need him . He can help us find Clarke and the other a.I. That was a mistake . I don 't think so . You will . Oh ! Let me go ! We are still experiencing a 3 % rejection rate . Don 't put Marcus with the others . Leave him to me . She can be persuasive . Chancellor , Dr. Griffin . Thank you for coming , Charles . I didn 't know i had a choice . So what is all this ? What I 'm about to tell you is classified . If you tell anyone any part of it- - I 'll be floated . I understand . Good . I need you to teach a crash course in wilderness survival- - farming , hunting , building shelters . To the prisoners ? Yes . Well , can I ask why ? We 're sending them to the ground . We have 99 prisoners here . We 've divided them into small , more manageable groups . They 'll be dead the moment the door opens . The ground won 't be survivable for another hundred years or more . What did you find ? Tell me . Kane : We 're only telling you what you need to know , Charles , nothing more . Your daughter 's in the sky box . It must be pretty compelling evidence of survivability if you 're willing to risk her life . Clarke 's in solitary . You won 't be seeing her . That 's ok . She paid attention the first time . Look . I 've--I 've taught most of these kids already or--or tried to . They 're not exactly receptive learners , though I suppose they will be now . They don 't know they 're going . And if you tell them- - I 'll be floated . Got that . Think of it this way . You finally get to teach earth skills to kids who might actually use them . Admittedly , it 's- - it 's a leap of faith , Charles . Take it with us . I can have them ready in 4 months , 3 if i- - they leave in two weeks . Ha ha ! Uh ... When do I start ? Let 's go . Take a seat . Ok . Come on . Ok . Keep moving . Oh ... It 's the girl under the floor . Pike : Welcome to earth skills . Jasper : It 's been an hour since we passed the airplane wreckage . Seeing as we 're using a map without any distances , it could be days before we reach Luna 's village . At least we know we 're going the right direction . Jasper : We 're running out of daylight . We should stop in the sun , recharge the battery . What sun ? We keep going until it dies . We keep going until we get to Luna . This her ? Yes . What do you think she 's gonna say when we show up asking to put an a.I. In her head ? Octavia : Lincoln said she helps those that are in trouble . She 'll help us , too . Jasper : Think she can help us find a better map ? Bellamy : Backtrack . We 'll find somewhere where the trees aren 't so bad . Hey ! Ohh ... Guess we 're going on foot . Jasper : Anyone hear the part where I said it could be days ? Stop . You hear that ? Water . Eyes sharp . They could be hostile . They 're not hostile . Put the guns down . Jasper : Where 's the village ? Octavia : No . Oh , no . It can 't be . Isn 't a village . It 's just a bunch of rocks . She 's gone . What do we do now ? The ability to make fire kept the human race alive during the ice age . Pike : There we go . Here we go . Yeah . Who knows ? It may do the same for us someday . Ahh ... Voila- - the difference between life and death . Thank you , Mr. Murphy . Perhaps you 'd like to tell us the key to surviving on the ground . No , not really . No . Pike : Ms. Blake , how about you ? The key to survival on earth , what is it ? Not dying ? You can laugh all you want , but we 've got a lot to learn here- - making fire , tying knots , how to navigate using the stars , how to hunt . You have to learn which plants you can eat and which- - which ones we can smoke ? Mr. Jordan , that is precisely why we had to separate you and Mr. green . Listen . The answer to my question . The key to surviving on the ground and on the ark is to keep fighting at all costs against all odds . The minute you give up , you 're dead . Am I boring you , Mr. Murphy ? I 'll survive . Pike : Uh uh ... Uh ! Uh ! Uh ... Uh ... Uh ! Pike : Uh ! Hey , you want to kill me , kill me ! Uh ... Ah ! Ugh ! Uh ! Uh ! Briggs , you don 't have to do this . You 're strong ! Fight it ! We 'll get our people and get out of here . Briggs ! Uh ! Who 's ready to take the key ? Pike : Ohh ... Uh ! What are the odds ? John Murphy ? Told you I 'd survive . Indra : You should have killed me on that battlefield . I won 't make the same mistake . You killed 300 of my people . Now you 'll take 300 cuts by my hand . Get on with it . Hnngh ! Ohh ... Hnngh ! Uhh ! Rrgh ! Ugh ! Uh ... Aah ! It 'll be dark soon . We need to talk about what we 're gonna do . We wait until first light , and then we split up and search the shore in both directions heh . Ah ... Nice . Yes . I agree . Lincoln wouldn 't have put this spot on the map unless it was important . Don 't touch that . Come on , o . How long ? I don 't know . I can 't even look at you ... Because every time I do , I see pike putting that gun to Lincoln 's head . I hear the gunshot . I see him fall . I didn 't kill Lincoln . No , but he is dead because of you . I came to you . You didn 't take my help . If you had just trusted me , i- - what did you just do ? Nothing . I just threw these in the fire . What is it ? Huh . Signal fire . He was trying to tell us . This is how we contact Luna . I 'll get more . Abby : Uh ! Abby . Marcus , oh , thank god . Are you all right ? Did they hurt you ? They found me hiding in the woods near the camp . Please tell me you know where Clarke is . No . I thought she was here . He 's telling the truth . No . I saw them shoot at her . She got in the rover with Jasper , and they got away , I 'm--I 'm sure . Well , that 's good . If the others found her , that means she 's safe . Listen to me . They 're after Clarke . How do you know they 're after her ? They questioned me for hours . She has something that they want . What ? What ? I don 't know . Alie : We don 't have time for this . If ontari is right and Clarke finds another nightblood , she 'll be able to activate the other a.I. We can 't let that happen . Marcus ... I 'm afraid . Try harder . He knows . Marcus . You 've taken the chip . Put him on the cross . Abby ... Abby . Abby , wait ! Uh ! Abby ! Uh ! Oh ! Abby . Listen , Abby , please . Uh ! Oh ! Don 't . Oh ... Abby , this is madness ! - This is unity . - Abby , please- take the key . - Please ... Wake up . Just tell us where Clarke and the others are hiding . I can 't do that . I- - yaah ! Gaah ! Yaah ! Aah ! Ohh ... Agh ! Agh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Let me guess , you came here to fix things , wanheda the peacemaker . I came to see if you 're ok . Well , I don 't need your help . Bellamy : Clarke , I 've lost her . Give her time , bellamy . There may be blood on your hands , but it 's not Lincoln 's . Some of it is . Maybe , but you didn 't want that to happen . You tried to stop it . Octavia will forgive you eventually . The question is , will you forgive yourself ? Forgiveness is hard for us . I was so angry at you for leaving . I don 't want to feel that way anymore . You know , you 're not the only one trying to forgive yourself . Maybe we 'll get that someday ... But we need each other , bellamy . What we 're doing now , the only way we 're gonna pull this off is together . Huh ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Mmph mmph ! No . No . It 's ok . Uh ! Oh ! Skaikru , bringers of death . Why should we give you safe passage ? Lincoln . He sent us . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . What is that ? Safe passage . What does it do ? Bellamy : Octavia , wait . I trust Lincoln . If only she drinks , only she goes . See you on the other side . O. Oh , crap . Oh , god ... Last chance . Together . I 'm sorry to hear about your son 's arrest . Will he be in my class today ? No . We 're keeping Wells in solitary until launch tomorrow . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . You don 't want him telling the others that the ark is dying . Charles- - it 's the only thing that makes sense . Why else would you send kids , and not scientists ? Do you even care if they live or die ? We are talking about my son . Yes . Then send me with them . Out of the question . What you teach them will- - well , I 've taught them nothing ! They don 't care , so they don 't learn . They don 't pay attention because they don 't think they have a reason to . Let me tell them we 're sending them down , and maybe if they 're afraid , then- - no . No . Please . I 've only got one more class to reach them . Then figure out a way to reach them because you are all they 've got . Ha ha ! All right . Can we just get out of here , seriously ? You got better things to do , Murphy ? Oh , it that an offer , mcintyre ? You 're an epic dick , Murphy . Everybody take your seats . Now ! I 'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about earth skills . Murphy : Oh , great . In that case- - sit down . How would you feel about assisting me with today 's lesson , Mr. Murphy ? Sign me up . What the hell was that fo- oh ! - Oh ! Oh , jeez . I know all about you , John Murphy . - Ah , you do , huh ? - Yeah . I do . Mother drank herself to death after father was floated for stealing medicine to save you . That 's a tough row to hoe . I 'll give you that . So what does he do with the second chance his father gave his life to buy for him ? Wasted it setting the arresting officer 's quarters on fire . Say something . Uh ! Do something . You know , I get it- - trying to teach us to fight back . - Wrong . - Hey ! Hey ! Uh ! Uh ! - Stop it ! - Uhh ! - Oh ! - Leave him alone ! Pike : No one is coming to help you . No one is coming to help any of you . Uh ! Uh ! Get off him ! Get off him ! Is that all you got ? It 's gonna take more than the kids from your own station to save you . - Who will save you ? - Open the door ! Help ! Override . Don 't you see ? This is life or death . Uh ! Open the door ! Help ! Hey ! - Charles , you all right ? - Fine . Are you out of your minds ? What the hell is this ? This is graduation . Congratulations . Class dismissed . Nngh ! Aah ! Agh ! Ah ! You can 't break me , grounder . Aah ! If you want her to stop , maybe you should try shutting up . Only one way this stops . Nngh ! What is wrong with you people ? He 's strong . We need him if we 're gonna fight our way out of here . - Listen to me ! - Agh ! Nngh ! Murphy : Our real enemy is out there . Jaha has an army of chipped soldiers . They don 't feel any pain . That means they 're not gonna stop until all of us either join them or die . Don 't waste your breath , kid . Ask yourself this . Do you want your revenge , or you want your people to live ? Both . I 'll get my revenge , just not today . Go float yourself . Everything I learned , i learned on the ground . Mm ... Voice , on P.A. : T minus 5 minutes and counting .

Luna , you 're the last of your kind , the last nightblood . So lexa 's dead , as well . Her spirit has chosen you to become the next commander . Titus entrusted me with the flame to give to you . Then he should have told you that I left my conclave swearing to never kill again . Clarke : You don 't have to kill . To lead is your birthright . How you lead is your choice . Here . I recognize the sacred symbol , but what is that ? This is the flame that holds the spirits of the commanders , of lexa . Will you take it and become the next commander ? No . Hey , wait .

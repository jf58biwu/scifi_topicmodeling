 Hey , everyone . I don 't want to spoil the night with some boring speech about the incredible year we 've had , capped with J-Bak Investments cracking the top five global finance companies . Yep . Yep . Well , my guess is you 're all here ' cause ... you know we 're taking good care of your money . How about that ? I 'll be honest with you . After what happened to me and to my family ... it would 've been easy to give up . I thought about it a lot . I read the articles , both fact and fiction . I won 't lie . It hurt . Especially the stuff about my sister . I admit , I wanted to run away and ... let everyone forget the name Bak . But then ... I think about him . My dad . He used to give these speeches . He was so good . Uh , you remember the ' 08 speech , Tae ? He made you feel like the crisis was the best thing that ever happened . My dad inspired confidence . You believed him . You trusted him . You knew you were a part of this family ... and that he 'd do whatever he could to take care of you . That 's what Bak meant to people . And that 's why I 'm back . Because I want it to mean that again . Believe in me . Trust me . And I promise ... I will take care of you . Enjoy yourselves . I would . Wait . Let 's think about this . I thought the plan was to get him to confess . Plan 's changed . Wait . It 's Detective Mun . Hey , make sure you cover the exit , okay ? - Okay . - Excuse me , coming through . - Mun did it . - He 's going to arrest him . Sometimes the law gets it right . I always had a good feeling about this guy . Mr. Bak . Mr. Bak ? You see these men here ? They 're with the Securities and Fraud division . And this is your warrant . Just come with us peacefully , or I will cuff you in front of all these people , including those reporters , okay ? That won 't be necessary , Detective . I 'll come with you . Cool . Let 's go . Help ! There 's my sister ! He shot him . He killed Mun . - What do we do now ? - We get that motherfucker . It 's her ! It really is her ! Kill her ! Where is he going ? Heading for the garage . His car 's being brought up . There 's an exit to the garage that way . These guys are professionals . They 'll spread out . They 'll come at us from multiple angles . We get the beady one first . - Why ? - He didn 't look at his weapon . The dangerous ones never check . Uh , I have an idea . Distract the big one , go over that car for a clean shot . I 'd go left . Draw out the big one , use the truck , straight for the beady one . I said I have an idea . What are you doing ? That was your idea ? To let them know we 're here ? No . The tank . Cars don 't blow up like they do on TV . I know . Wait . Do you mind ? I ... The slope of the garage was gonna bring the gas right here . Okay . That was hot . Oh , shit . Not that easy . The curtain falls . Fuck . Oh , shit . This is Joong-Ki Bak . Open the fucking gate right now ! Love to , J-Bak . But first , I need you to do something for me . What ? Confess to framing your sister and murdering your father , and you 'll be free to go . Who ... who the hell is this ? Who are we ? Justice , motherfucker . That 's from The Root of All Evil . I love that movie . Thank you , Bug . Maybe not my best film , but some good lines in it . Shit . Shit . Help me . I got you . - We need eyes on this . - Working on it . We 're inside the grid now . We have him stopped at a red light up ahead . Whoo ! Are you serious ? My sister is the fucking Terminator ? Fuck . Fuck ! Fuck ! Leave me alone ! There has to be a major police response . It 's big . It 's getting bigger . Cops are shutting down the area . Oh , it 's a road block . Oh , shit . Shit ! Out of my way ! Come on ! How do we stop this guy ? We need a weapon . Oh , shit ! Sun . Please , save me . Please , Sun . My company ... even my reputation ... is meaningless without my daughter . You ... killed him . He was going to tell the truth to the court . You murdered our father . I was nowhere near him . I know why you did it . You will pay . I swear it ! Who am I ? I have an enemy . And I won 't stop until he 's dead . Or I am . He wanted you to know that he has never been the forgiving type . You have a heart as soft as a baby bird . Please , Sun . Take care of your brother . Do this for me . Who ... am ... I ? Please , I beg you . Please , stop . I 'll confess . I 'll tell them whatever you want . Please , Sun . Sun , please . You 're not a killer . You 're not like me . I 'm your brother . You were my brother . Did you all see what I saw ? We did . Who was that guy ? Tae Park . Politician . Figures . What are we going to do ? If she goes back to prison they 'll kill her . No one 's going to prison . What do we need ? You have access to the traffic systems ? I told you , I 'm an all-access kind of girl . - Street map . - Got it . What else do we need ? - A big-ass ... - ... intersection . Big-ass intersection coming up . - Bug ? - Almost in . Are you sure about this ? These wagons are built like safes . You 'll be all right . - The switch is ready ? - I 'm in . Ten ... eight ... four , three , two , one ! Hold on ! There 's a subway . There 's a train two blocks that way . We won 't make that . Help us . Please . Please , help us . Riley Blue . I knew you 'd call . Puck ? Hop on . Snuggle up . Oh ! Mm ... I don 't know about you , but I 'm fricking dead . It has been a very intense few days . From Teagan 's wedding , to a political riot , to a high-speed chase . There 's never a dull moment , that 's for sure . Is this our life now ? Is this our new normal ? I can think of worse normals . Are you okay with it ? What do you mean ? I mean ... you didn 't sign up for all this . It 's not like you did either . But I don 't have a choice . These voices are in my head whether I want them or not . True . Though , when I think back , I don 't remember being given a choice either ... when this nerdy girl walked into City Lights ... and this voice in my head was telling me , " Whatever you do ... " do not let her go until you get her number . " What ? Here 's the thing . We all wake up and we have to take the same Terms and Conditions box : Everyday stuff will happen to you . Some of it will be good . Some of it will be bad . Choice is less about what happens than it is about how we deal with it . I 've been thinking a lot about all the things that have happened to us over this past year . I won 't lie . Sometimes it 's terrifying . And sometimes it 's incredibly exciting . It 's been maddening ... enlightening ... confusing ... and always unpredictable . However ... I don 't think there 's been a single day when I didn 't hear that same voice in my head telling me ... " Whatever you do ... do not let her go . " Nomi Marks ... will you marry me ? Oh , my God . - Oh , my God , I don 't believe this . - What ? Amanita Caplan ... will you marry me ? Abso-fucking-lutely ! You ? Every day of my life . Mm ... Smells so good . You cannot change the world on an empty stomach . Whoa ! What ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm good , Mom . Okay . Last year , when I heard about what you did , I had a feeling you were one of us . But then we heard that you were running for political office . So we figured you were either crazy or hunting for BPO . Still , we were curious . So , even though no sensate with half a brain should go to a public event like your speech without taking a blocker first we came . We heard you . Mentally , I might ... Kala , I 'm home ! Welcome back . How was your trip ? I need a drink first . You want one ? Yes . That 's a very good idea . I have been thinking about a lot of things that have been going on with me . - And with us . And ... - Yes , so have I. You have ? Cheers . - Maybe we should sit . - Yeah . Um ... Is that a present ? Yes . Um , from your friend Ajay . A late wedding gift , he said . Ajay was here ? He was in the neighborhood and wanted to drop it off . He only stayed a moment . But he said we should open it together . No , Kala , we need to talk . - Yeah , sure ... - No ! - Has this been x-rayed ? - X-rayed ? Yes , sir . It 's safe . Safe ? Rajan , what 's going on ? Rajan ? What 's going on ? Oh , my God . Oh , it 's beautiful . Ajay 's a believer ? No , he 's not . Hey . What does that say ? " Caution . Easily broken . " Well , that 's rather obvious . It looks like it belongs in a museum . I will send him a thank-you note . Are you okay ? Kala , just listen . I need you to do something for me , and I know this will be difficult because I need you to do it without asking a lot of questions , which I 'm telling you right now that I cannot answer . I have not told you about lots of things that are going on because I have been trying to protect you ... and maybe , selfishly , our marriage . I did not go to Bangalore . I was in Delhi . I have been cooperating with Agent Singh and the federal police on a complex investigation into political corruption . Ajay is a part of that investigation . Oh , my God . I cannot tell you more because it will only put you at risk . But what I need you to do is get on a plane tonight . Agent Singh warned me that it might be necessary to move my family for their protection . I purchased a flat in Paris that nobody knows about . - What ? - I 'm sure you 'll be safe there . Okay , Rajan , I don 't under ... Kala , I understand that this is all a shock . This is difficult for me , too . I know you have important things to discuss with me , but I 'm asking you to hold on , fully understanding that the future of our marriage is uncertain , but that 's a small thing compared to your safety . If anything were to happen to you , I could never forgive myself . Please . Believe me . You have to go . Reports are still coming in from the guests of Mr. Bak , but at least six people were killed and dozens injured . Witnesses saw Sun Bak , Mr. Bak 's sister , at the center of attacks . Last year , Ms. Bak was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to ten years in Cheongju Women 's Correctional Institute . Several weeks ago , she escaped ... Isn 't it funny how things work out ? Sh ! I 'm not usually the kind of guy who believes in certain types of " happy endings , " but ... for this , I will make an exception . Shh ! Ladies , try to see this from my perspective . Traditionally , in male narratives ... when you save the , uh ... princess ... it entitles you to certain rewards . These aren 't my rules . This is just standard operating procedure . Ahh ! Stop ! Ow , ow ! Please , stop ! Oh ! - Go . - Oh ! Oh ! Sit . Oh ! Ow ! That really hurt ! In critical care is Detective Mun , who was the first officer to arrive at the scene . He 's still alive . So , you were there , weren 't you , Minister Park ? That was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life . No one is safe until that psychopath is off our streets . I should have killed him . No . Mun was there to arrest him . They know . It 's going to be okay . But right now , we have another problem . We need information . You 're the naughty one . Oh ! Change of heart . I see . How many sensates are you connected to ? Well , I 'm not usually one to brag , but there 's ... Ow ! Three-hundred-eighty-seven ! Three-hundred-eighty-seven , I said . Oh , God ! We need those connections . What for ? - To fight . - To fight . Oh , to fight . Well ... I tell you , this is the opposite of what I would call a satisfying encounter . Don 't let him leave . Stay away from me . Don 't hurt him . We need to get him to trust us . Bowling ball 's here , is he ? Good . Where is he ? Over here , male narrative . And what 's with the hair ? - What 's with the hair ? - Yeah , what 's with the hair ? Don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't . Listen ... I am a lover , I 'm not a fighter . You guys want a sens-orgy that circles the globe , I 'm your guy . You guys want to storm the ramparts , then ... - Puck . - Holy shit . Get away from them . Leave this town . You need to be on blockers 24 / 7 . I have to go . If you guys want to kill me , then just do it quick . What just happened ? - I 've been quarantined . - Why ? The Cannibal . He 's hunting . Huh ... I was looking for this . So you told him ? - No , not yet . - Why ? What happened ? I 'm not sure . But you 're still leaving ? Rajan is involved in some kind of corruption investigation . Rajan ? Is he being investigated ? No , his friend . Huh . Interesting . Why ? Why is that interesting ? Because both of the men in your life are connected to criminals . What does that say about you ? Hmm . I 'm sure it speaks volumes about my poor choices , my own dishonesty , indecency , and general lack of good character . When you put it like that , it sounds very sexy . Mnh-mnh . No , I ... Why ? Because right now I need something . I need to know something ... before I get any more confused . And every time I kiss you , I 'm always left even more confused than I ever was . But before I get on a plane and go anywhere ... before I discover what it actually feels like ... to be in the same room with you ... before I know what it really feels like ... to have these lips against mine and ... not just in my head ... something I might be imagining ... I need to know something . What ? Something true . I 've never lied to you . But you haven 't told me the whole truth either . If I told you the whole truth ... if I told you that you 're the last thought I have before I sleep ... if I told you that you 're the first thought I have when I wake ... - if I told you ... - Tell me . ... how much I love you ... would it have done any good ? - Yes . - How ? Because it would help me admit how much I love you . Have you ever been to Paris ? Good ! Because I want it to be just for us . Welcome home , sexy . I 've missed you . What ? What 's wrong ? Oh . Is she with you ? Isn 't that just too perfect ? It 's her . I warned you , Wolfgang . There are only two sides in this world : with me or against me . Imagine my surprise when I found out how badly the Cannibal wanted you . Open ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Ah ! Hello , Wolfgang . When they slice you up , I want the last face you think of to be mine . Oh , my God ! Oh , my ... Oh , my God ! Help ! Help us , please ! Sun ! It 's Whispers , he 's got Wolfgang ! Oh , my God ! Lito , Capheus ! Please ! It 's Lila ! Wolfgang 's in trouble ! Help ! Oh , God , please , help us ! Please . What can we do ? I have a plan . But ... we 're gonna need blockers . Okay . Kala , if you are gonna make your flight , you have to leave now . Yeah . I 'm leaving . I 'm coming . I 'm sorry , baby . I 'm so sorry . Oh , there you are . I 've been waiting . As you can see , I 'm eager to get started . This is the Traceworks . Your mother , Angelica , was instrumental to the success of it . This organization owes much to her . Now , the , uh , psycellium is very sensitive to pain . But acute pain produces one of the clearest echoes that we are able to trace . I 'm going to fucking kill you . This really is my favorite part . Paddles . Now . - Ah ! - Oh ! Ah ! Again . Ah ! Yes . Once more . Stop . Ah ! Now ... tell me the first thought that comes to your mind . Kala . Ms. Kala Rasal . Thank you , Wolfgang . You see how easy that was ? That 's all for now . Why won 't you tell me what 's wrong ? Capheus , huh ? I 've never seen you like this . My son greets the morning feeling today might be a beautiful day . Regrets ? They will come . Oh , my God . Dani ! Dani ! - Call an ambulance . - No , no . - Call an ambulance , please ! - I can 't get to a hospital . What are you talking about ? Come on , what 's wrong with you , baby ? We have to get to London . I 'll explain everything . - We have to get to London . - What are you talking about ? This is for you . Your gate today is number 38 . To your right-hand side . - Have a safe flight . - Thank you . Good morning . How is our patient doing this morning ? Now ... who else is in there ? Eventually , you will tell me , whether you want to or not . Paddles . Now ... where is Mr. Gorski hiding ? - How do I stop this ? - You cooperate . - Like you ? - I know what happened . I 've seen it enough times . I 've experienced it . There 's only one way to end it . Jonas was right . I just want one thing . Let me guess . Leave Riley alone . I 'll give you anything you want . Of course I should agree . I should promise you this and that in order to leash the rest of your cluster as quickly as possible , but we both know that would be a complete lie . We both know exactly what 's going to happen . One by one , I 'm going to hunt your cluster down . And no matter what you do , I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir . And I will enjoy feeling you experience her death ... inch by inch , piece by piece . There 's just one tiny problem with that plan . And what is that ? Me . Oh , God . You 're here . No ! I can 't visit you . That 's right , Milt , old pal . You can 't visit me because I 'm actually here . Angelica . There 's no one behind the glass . That camera 's dead . It 's a soundproof room . Will , stop it . - Jonas . - Jonas ? You 're on blockers . Jonas , this is it . You have to choose . Whose side are you on ? I 'm sorry , Will ... but you won 't understand this choice right now . Don 't leave me ! You all alone , Milt ? Let me put you out of your misery . Now . Mr. Secretary , get me the Chairman . We have an emergency at the Parliament facility . Oh , fuck . Wait . Hold on . Security protocol has been activated . It 's not reading . I 'm going to have to call this in . On your knees ! Hands above your head ! You want a war ? We 'll give you a war .

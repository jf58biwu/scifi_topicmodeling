 ♪ Subtitles by ♪ XQ2 ☻ ♥ I used to think this was the beginning of your story . Memory is a strange thing . It doesn 't work like I thought it did . We are so bound by time . By its order . It 's OK . Come back to me . Come back to me . Come back to me . Stick em up ! Are you the sheriff in this here town ? These are my tickle guns and I 'm gonna getcha ! No . You want me to chase you ? You better run . I remember moments in the middle . I love you . I hate you ! And this was the end . Come back to me . Baby , come back to me . But , now Im not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings . There are days that define your story beyond your life . Like the day they arrived . Good Morning . Where is everyone ? Ok . Well let 's get started . Today , we 're talking about Portuguese and why it sounds so different from the other Romance languages . The story of Portuguese begins in the Kingdom of Galicia ... Oh ... sorry ? In the Middle Ages , where language was seen as an expression of art . Any news you wanna share ? Dr. Banks can you turn the TV to a news channel ? Police have already set up a blockade , here , around the area And as you can see , we got just about as close as we can ... but unfortunately , Montana right now , is on complete lock down . The object apparently touched down 40 minutes ago just north of I-94 . We 're waiting to hear if this is perhaps an experimental vessel or ... Hold on , it ... I 'm learning that more objects like this have landed in as many as 8 other locations around the world Yes ? Henry ? This is from a site in Hokkaido . This is worldwide . It is happening right now . OK , um ... so , class is dismissed . For now , we 're simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object . So , you 're saying its not ours ? - Do you even know if its from Earth ? - We 're still collecting information . We 're coordinating with other countries . We 're not the only ones to have one of these in our backyard . If this is some kind of peaceful first contact , why send twelve ? Why not just one ? I don 't know , Mom . I 'm watching the same news report you are . Well , Mom ... please don 't bother with that channel . How many times I have to tell you those people are idiots ? Yeah , well , do I sound nervous ? Ok , exactly . So ... Ahm , me ? You know me . I 'm about the same Mom , I 'm fine . Ok , I 'll call you later . Bye . and at around 8 hours after landing , there 's still no signs of what might be called first contact . Now , the objects measure at least 1,500 ft. tall ... two more reported to have penetrated Russian airspace : one in Siberia and the other off the coast of the Black Sea , suspended above the ocean . So far there are 12 unidentified objects spread across the globe . There is no obvious logic to their locations and no evidence that the ships are even occupi ... who entertain the idea that if it is a kind of vessel , it may be unmanned . Regardless , we have a protocol for scenarios like this . [ Russian news ] After Tuesdays ' extraordinary events , the President this morning , has declared a state of emergency with as many as 5,000 National Guard being deployed to the state of Montana , alone . Borders are closed and flights have been grounded , stranding millions of travelers . Panic buying of gas , water and food continues to escalate and Federal authorities have temporarily lifted all caps on overtime for law enforcement . The ATF has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses , forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms to close their doors to the public . 48 hours later and no further development Two days ... and already the public expects us to know the answers . I 'm Colonel G.T. Weber . We never formally met , but two years ago , you did some Farsi translation for Army Intellenge ? - Oh . You made quick work of those insurgent videos . You made quick work of those insurgents . You are on the top ... of everyone 's list when it comes to translations . And you have another two years in the SSBI , so you still have top secret clearance . That 's why I 'm in your office and not in Berkeley . OK ? I have something I need you to translate for me . Why are you here ? Can you understand us ? Where did you come from ? Now you heard it ... what do you make of it ? Is that ... ? Yes . - How many ? - How many what ? H-how many , speaking ? Two . Assuming , they were not speaking at the same time . Are you sure that they have mouths ? How would you approach translating this ? You hear any words ? Phrases ? I don 't ... I don 't know . So what can you tell me ? I can tell you that it 's impossible to translate from an audio file . I would need to be there to interact with them . You didn 't need that for the Farsi translation . I didn 't need it because I already knew the language , but this is ... I know what you 're doing . - Tell me what I 'm doing . - I 'm not taking you to Montana . It 's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site for everybody who has a T.S. clearance . I 'm just telling you what it would take to do this job . This is not a negotiation . If I leave here , your chance is gone . Good day . Colonel . You mentioned Berkeley , are you going to ask Danvers next ? Maybe . Before you commit to him , ask him the Sanskrit word for war , and its translation . An agreement on sharing scientific discoveries looks closer tonight as Russia and China join talks at the United Nations . Meanwhile , financial markets across the world are in crisis as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 2,000 points , in its worst weekly decline in ... - Good Morning . - Colonel ? 'Gavisti ' . He says it means an argument . - What do you say , it means ? - A desire for more cows . Pack your bags . - All right , give me 20 minutes ? - We take off in 10 . Dr. Banks . ( * * * ) Sorry , I couldn 't hear what you were saying . " Language is the foundation of civilization . " It is the glue that holds the people together . " It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict . " Louise , this is Ian Donnelly . Louise Banks , Ian Donnelly . - That 's quite a greeting ! - Yeah ? Well , you wrote it . Yup . It 's the kind of thing you write as a preface . Dazzle them with the basics . Well , it 's great . - Even if it 's wrong . - It 's wrong ? Well , the cornerstone of civilization isn 't language , it 's science . Ian is a theoretical physicist from Los Alamos . You 'll be reporting to me , but you 'll be working with him , when you 're in the shell . That 's what they 're calling the UFO . Priority one : what do they want , where are they from ? And beyond that , how did they get here ? Are they capable of faster than light travel ? Are they planning on ... a list of questions that I want you to go over . Starting with a series of handshake binary sequences ... How about we just talk to them , before we start throwing math problems at them ? This is why you 're both here . I 'll bring the coffee . Coffee with some aliens . - Alright , I want you to take these two to Dr. Kettler . - Yes sir . Follow the captain to Medical ... the procedure should take just a few minutes and then we 'll get started . They 're gonna take care of your bags . I 'll get your cell phones ... cell phones . Follow me . Put these on , you gotta wear them at all times . Sir , they 're here . Louise Banks ? Ian Donnelly ? When was the last time , either of you have eaten ? - Last night . - Same . When was the last time you did something stressful ? Does now count ? Just saying . Who was being carted off in a med-evac ? Not everyone is able to process experiences like this . I 'm gonna get some blood from you and give you an immunization dose that covers a battery of bacterial threats . Could you sign these please ? And roll up your sleeves . - Either of you claustrophobic ? - No . - No . Currently taking any medications ? Allergies ? - Pregnant ? - No . The booster is a kick to your system , so you may experience some side effects : nausea , dizziness , headaches . Or ringing in your ears , like you have tinnitus . At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room . Have you found a scientific explanation for it ? - Like , is it for them ? - Oh , no , we think it 's for us . The air doesn 't seem to circulate inside the chamber , so ... after two hours , you run out of oxygen . It doesn 't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room . Atmosphere . Excuse me ? If their atmosphere is different from earth , It would certainly take hours to rebalance the O2 content and pressure , for us , every time they opened their door . So you 're saying they could suffocate us if they wanted to ? This is Agent David Halpern , CIA . - Let me get you two to your stations . - Yes sir . Remember , we need answers as soon as possible . What they want , where they 're from , why they 're here . This is the priority . Everyone . This is Dr. Ian Donnelly , he 'll be running this team , here . Have they responded to anything ? Shapes , patterns , numbers , Fibonacci ? We can 't tell what they 're saying , when they respond to ' hello ' , so ... don 't get ahead of yourself . - What have you figured out ? - Just getting started . Good Morning . This is Dr. Louise Banks . - She 'll be heading your team . - Dr. Banks , it 's a pleasure Dr. Banks is taking over the mission from Dr. Waller . It 's the 15 minute warning . D 'you scuba-dive before ? What kind of radiation exposure are we walking into ? Nominal , these are just for safety . So , is there any physical contact with the ... Am I the only one having trouble saying , aliens ? There 's a wall , like a glass wall . You can 't get to them . So , what do they look like ? You 'll see soon enough , hurry up . The suits are clumsy at first , but , you get used to 'em . Haul up in the second vehicle . We 'll be there in a few minutes . Make sure you hold onto something . Every 18 hours , the door opens up , at the bottom . That 's when we go in . Yeah , that just happened . Alright , lets move . Time is wasting . Ready ? - You ready ? - Let 's do it . Condor , I 'm proceeding first with Captain Marks , over . Gravity , nominal in the antechamber , over . It 's all good , sir , you can proceed . Stand by . OK , bring it up . You OK ? Yeah . Dr. Banks . You can do this . C 'mon . I dunno , I ... I think ... aah ! Grab her . Dr. Donnelly , you good ? Yeah . Holy fuck ! We 're gonna go down there , and you 're gonna start your job . - OK . - OK . Everybody , move out . Alpha Team in position ? Team 's in position . We 're on the move . Setting up equipment with telemetry , over What happens now ? They arrive . Dr. Banks . Dr. Banks ? You can start . Wait , just a minute . Am I fired ? You 're better than the last guy . That doesn 't make me feel any better . You both have till 02 : 00 hours to figure something out . OK , what happens , then ? You go back in . Violence continues to spread across the US , today in the wake of the 12 landings . The President has declared a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew , after the crackdown by the National Guard failed to prevent a third night of looting across the country . In North Dakota , 144 members of the St. Lawrence Pentecostal cult are feared dead after they set their compound ablaze . Their website claims , the arrival of the aliens set in motion a prophecy that 12 sets of ... Uh , we 're up in 15 . You got any new intel ? Yeah , we 've been playing back some of their sounds ... Where does that get you ? Well , they play audio back at us , from an unseen source . Audio of what ? It 's bits of conversations from the room , random clips of dialogue . Really , we ... We have nothing . T minus 9 minutes to shell access . T minus 9 minutes to shell access . - What 's that for ? - A visual aid . Look , I 'm never gonna be able to speak their words , if they ARE talking . But they might have some sort of written language or basis for ... visual communication . OK . Let 's get started . Human . Human . I 'm human . I 'm human . Human . - Oh my God . - Are you getting this ? Yes sir , it 's all going back to base camp . Louise , its incredible ! Human . Human . Human . OK ... OK , slow down Louise . I don 't wanna take away from your success in there , but Dr. Banks , is this really the right approach ? Trying to teach them how to speak and read ? That 's gotta take longer . You 're wrong . Its faster . Everything you do in there , I have to explain to a room full of men , whose first and last question is , ' how can this be used against us ? ' So you 're gonna have to give me more than that . Kangaroo . What is that ? In 1770 , Captain James Cook 's ship ran aground off the coast of Australia and he led a party into the country , and they met the aboriginal people . One of the sailors pointed at the animals that hop around and put their babies in their pouch , and he asked what they were . And the Aborigines said " kangaroo " . And your point is ? It wasn 't till later that they learned that kangaroo means , " I don 't understand " . So ... I need this so that we don 't misinterpret things in there , otherwise this is gonna take ten times as long . I can sell that , for now . But I need you to submit your vocabulary words before the next session . - Fair . And remember what happened to the Aborigines . A more advanced race , nearly wiped them out . - Its a good story . - Thanks . Its not true , but it proves my point . I think we were able to reproduce some prime number sequences back at them . So , that 's something . Well , congratulations , you 're a parrot . It 's a lot more than that , you cheeky bastard . Dont you see ? They can 't seem to follow our algebra , but , complex behaviours ; that clicks . Well , that doesn 't make any sense at all , does it ? Problem is , not everyone shares our policy of being open with the aliens . Have you met Gen. Shang ? The call sign for him is 'big domino ' . Whatever Shang does , at least four other nations 'll follow . - Louise , we have to gain ground today . - OK . - You have a vocabulary list for me ? - I do . You 're gonna teach them your name and Ian 's ? Yeah , so that we can learn their names , if they have names , and then introduce pronouns later . These are all grade school words . Eat , walk . Help me understand . No-no-no , not the top ! Ok , this is where you wanna get to , right ? - That is the question . - OK . So , first we need to make sure that they understand what a question is , OK ? The nature of a request for information , along with the response . Then , we need to clarify the difference between a specific ' you ' ... and a collective ' you ' . Because ... we don 't wanna know why Joe Alien is here , we want to know why they all landed . And purpose requires an understanding of intent . We need to find out : do they make conscious choices ? Or is their motivation so instinctive that they don 't understand a ' why question ' at all ? And biggest of all we need to have enough vocabulary with them , that we understand their answer . I get it . Stick to your list . Just ... don 't add anything to it . Gravity : 0.97 . Oxygen level : 21.4 % , over . Al Moony , setting up equipment and telemetry , over . Let 's get started . Louise . Louise , I am Louise . What is that ? Is that a new symbol ? I can 't tell . I dunno , I think it 's the symbol for ' human ' again . It just has a little curl on the end . Maybe they indicate a question . I dunno . I dunno , Louise , I think they 're getting confused . Dr. Banks , perhaps we should move on to the next word . Dr. Banks ! - Hey , baby . - What 's going on ? What are you doing ? - I 'm fine . - Are you insane ? They need to see me . She 's taken off her hazmat suit . Dr. Banks ! - Are you OK ? - You 're risking contamination . - They need to see me . - Dr. Banks . - Dr. Banks ! - She 's walking toward the screen . Should we abort ? Request noted . Stand by for flag order . Go back to your stations . Now , that 's a proper introduction . OK . Louise . I am Louise . Ian , you wanna introduce yourself ? Ah , yes ... Louise . Screw it . Everybody dies , right ? Sir , Donnelly is taking off his hazmat suit . Permission to abort ? Continue the session . Ian . Louise . You ? Who are you ? I think those are their names . They have names . So what are we gonna call them ? I dunno . I was thinking , Abbott and Costello . Yeah . - Yeah ? - Yeah , I like it . I like it . Wow ! Team one , exit your vehicles and proceed directly ahead to the decontamination tent . Leave your respirator on until you reach the equipment room . - All right ? - No . Team two , exit your vehicles and continue to the decontamination tent . Leave your respirators on , and do not hesitate until you 've reached the equipment room . - How do you feel ? - Overworked . I guess , I don 't need to tell you , you 're putting yourself at risk . There 's no signs of radiation poisoning , yet . We 'll see how your blood tests look . - For now , I 'm gonna give you another boost . - OK . No radiation . Nothing else we can detect either . But I 'd give them a strong cocktail , regardless . It 's the first time we 've made significant progress . Alright . We 'll take the risk . - OK , honey ... - What is going on ? - Honey ... - Is there anything you can tell me ? - I 'm fine . - You don 't need to worry , OK ? - How can I not worry ? Just calm down . Just calm down . Becky asked me , if the monsters are going to kill Daddy . Honey , its not gonna happen . - Just stay safe . - You don 't need to worry . Please , I 'm so scared . Here are some of the many things we don 't know about heptopods . Greek : Hepta ... seven . Pod ... foot . Seven feet ... heptopod . Who are they ? Trying to answer this in any meaningful way is hampered by the fact that , outside of being able to see them and hear them , the heptopods leave absolutely no footprint . The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown . The shell emits no waste , no gas , no radiation . Assuming that the shells communicate with each other , they do so without detection . The air between the shells is untroubled by sonic emission or light wave . Are they scientists or tourists ? If they 're scientists , they don 't seem to ask a lot of questions . Why did they park where they did ? The world 's most decorated experts can 't crack that one . The most plausible theory is that they chose places on earth with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes . But there are exceptions . The next most plausible theory is that Sheena Easton had a hit song in each of these sites in 1980 . So , we just don 't know . How do they communicate ? Here , Louise is putting us all to shame . The first breakthrough was to discover that there 's no correlation between what a heptopod says , and what a heptopod writes . Unlike all written human languages , their writing is semasiographic . It conveys meaning , it doesn 't represent sound . Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted oppurtunity , Passing up a second communications channel . We have our friends in Pakistan to thank for their study of how heptopods write . Because unlike speech , a logogram is free of time . Like their ship or their bodies . Their written language has no forward or backward direction . Linguists call this nonlinear orthography . Which raises the question : is this how they think ? Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using 2 hands , starting from either side . You 'd have to know each word you wanted to use , as well as how much space they would occupy . A heptopod can write a complex sentence in two seconds , effortlessly . It 's taken us a month to make the simplest reply . Next : expanding vocabulary . Louise thinks it could easily take another month to be ready for that . Hey . - Hey . - Weber 's looking for you . Yeah , well why do you think I 'm hiding out here ? Come on up . Nice out here , huh ? Yeah , it 's a nice view . Away from the noise . You know , I was just thinking about you . You approach language like a mathematician . You know that , right ? I won 't take that as a compliment . Yeah , well it is . And ... I watch you steer us around these communication traps that I didn 't even know existed . So , why ... I guess that 's why I 'm single . Trust me , you can understand communication and still end up single . Oh . I feel like everything that happens in there ... comes down to the two of us . Yeah , it 's a good thing , though , right ? You and I ? Have you seen the jokers that we 're working with ? Thank God , I got you . Tonight , the first photograph of the aliens goes viral . " Biological contamination is a major risk factor at the Montana site " . So , say environmental pressure groups . 800,000 march on Washington to protest the government 's handling of the crisis . All this , and more , special coverage . First contact with whoever it is that is inside that thing , and who do we have running the show ? The government . That 's right , folks . The same government who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our military . Look at these people . Most of them don 't even have guns . We could be facing a full scale invasion , and our President is just willing to sit back and let them waltz in and take our country . We are falling asleep at the wheel , people ! You know what I 'm talking about , I know you do . What if , the smartest thing we could do , right now , would be to give them a show of force ? I 'm talking about a shot across the bow . I wanna hear what you think . Caller ♪ 1 , you 're on the air , what do you think about all this ? What 's this word ? Planet . Green ... planet . That 's lie , um , the Earth is a planet . Want to see my project for Miss . Garrett 's class ? Yeah , little nose . We had to make up our own TV show . If we had one . - And who are those two people ? - That 's you and Dad . The show is called : Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals . Ah . Oh , its lovely . Ok . Um ... - You know , it 's OK to be sad that your dad and I ... - You know . I 'm not . 'Cause we both love you very much . I know . It 's just a cartoon : not real . Louise ? You alright ? Yeah . Yeah , I-I 'm fine . I 'm not sure it 's something , I can ... I can explain . When was your last checkup with Dr. Kettler ? I 'm OK . Gonna get some air . - I 'm OK . - Alright . How you feelin ' ? I need some sleep , but ... I 'm fine . Yeah ? Y 'know , I was doing some reading about this idea that ... if you immerse yourself into a foreign language , that you can actually rewire your brain . Yeah , the Sapir – Whorf hypothesis . It is a theory that ... It is the theory , that , the language you speak determines how you think and ... Yeah , it affects how you see everything . It was ... I 'm curious . Are you dreaming in their language ? I may have had a few dreams , but I don 't ... I don 't think that that makes me unfit to do this job . - Did you sleep ? - A little . Do you know Mandarin ? The voice you 're about to hear belongs to China 's military chief . General Shang . Put it on . We got a satellite feed , here who he 's talking to , if you want to look . Wait , go back . Stop . He 's saying that each of the 12 is offering advanced technology . Back again ... and play . Our science team is attempting to decode the sets ... " sets " ? I don 't know what that means . Something about advantage , suits , honor and flowers . I don 't ... I dunno , that 's all . I don 't know what it means either . An hour ago , China mobilized forces ... and now Russia is following suit . Shang is about to start something . Following same suits ... suits , honor , flowers ... Colonel , those are all tile sets in Mahjong . God , are they ... ? Are they using a game to converse with their heptopods ? Maybe , why ? Well , let 's say that I taught them chess instead of English . Every conversation would be a game , every idea expressed through opposition . Victory , defeat : you see the problem ? If all I ever gave you was a hammer ... Everything 's a nail . We need to ask the big question . Ready or not . Heptopod 's purpose . Tell me your purpose on Earth . What is your purpose ? Do we only have Costello ? Ok . There you are . What does it say ? Offer weapon . - Well , you saw what they wrote ! - Using a word they don 't fully understand . Enough ! Louise . We don 't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and a tool . Our language like our culture is messy and sometimes one can be both . And it 's quite possible that they 're asking us to offer them something , put the other way around . Like the first part of a trade . So how do we clarify their intentions beyond those two words ? I go back in . Right away we go back in and we clear this up . - It 's more complicated than that . - How is it more complicated than that ? Colonel , the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you . We need to sit on this information till we know what it means . So we aren 't sharing it with our enemies . We have to consider the idea that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves , until only one faction prevails . - There is no evidence of that . - Sure there is . Just grab a history book . The British with India , the Germans with Rwanda . They even got a name for it , in Hungary . ( Salami tactics ) Yeah ... We 're a world with no single leader . It 's impossible to deal with just one of us . And with the word weapon , now ... Halpern ... Yes General . No confirmation , yet . Stand by . Anything ... What did they say ? China and Russia are off the grid . They aren 't speaking to anyone . Whatever they learned in their last session has them spooked . Yes sir ... We have orders to do the same . - Wait these are our allies ! - Put us on radio silence ! Do it . We received a message from the hept ... Dammit ! We need to be talking to each other ! You wanna talk to them ? Find out what this means . Base-camp talk is now offline . All interpreters ... Don 't call Information , they 're offline . stand down , report to unit coordinators . We 've never re-entered a session , before . Louise , trust me OK ? We got time . Just gotta step on it , alright ? " Use weapon " , This is the alien message , said to have provoked the Chinese government to withdraw their scientists from the international mission today . In a statement , General Shang said : " China no longer trusts the aliens who want to divide us . " Humanity must be protected . " China has asked for immediate talks at the UN . Alpha 1-9er , this is Condor , over . Alpha 1-9er , this is Condor . Come in , over . Captain Marks , Condor , not receiving transmission . Perhaps they can hear mine . Captain Marks , all escorters are ordered to cease all activity . No-no-no ... Dr. Banks you can 't go in there . - We just need to ask one question . - Dr. Banks ! The session is finished . You can 't go back in , it 's dangerous . Look , we just need 5 minutes . Don 't sweat it . - Marks , let 'em go . Hey , Abbott . So , what are we calling this ? Session 37 ? Ah , no : 36 , Part 2 . Ok . Ok . What do you know ? We 've been attempting to hail Captain Marks . The escort units are not responding , sir . - Why not ? Send security . Offer a weapon ... question mark . Are you offering us something ? Technology , apparatus , method . Yeah , see , this is a different word . This ... this segment , it 's a lot busier . Give ... technology ... now . What 's he doing ? Captain , on your 10 . Security detail inbound , sir . T minus 4 minutes remaining . We need to see this through . OK , this is it , lock and load . - We just need to hold them off until it 's done . - Copy , that . Free shot , this is forward fire only * . Load up and get to cover . Stay fresh and we can avoid casualties . Abbott wants me to write on the barrier . Can you , even , do that ? I don 't know . I can 't do it with both hands . Louise . What is that ? Hey ! Hey , hey , take it easy . You suffered a concussion . Just lay back . How do you feel ? - How is Ian ? - Same as you . He 's OK . Who ... Who did this ? Some soldiers . Been watching too much TV . - What is that ? - Take it easy , take it easy . This place is no longer secure . We 're standing by to evacuate . Where is Ian ? Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago . He wouldn 't leave until he knew you were OK . The whole tent is on the clock to figure out whatever it is you were given up there . This is all of it . The feed wasn 't interrupted by the explosion ? That 's right . - You see something ? - I don 't know , yet . I 'm gonna need my team to get together with Louise 's team . - I need everyone working on this . - We cannot leave . - Glad to see you 're awake . - We need to go back in there . We need to explain to them that this wasn 't our fault . - We can 't go back inside . - We have to ! What happened in there was an attack . We can hope for the best , but I have to prepare for retaliation . - We may have to evacuate . - That 's the wrong move . As long as they stay , we have to stay . Well , they 're not leaving . Why does it feel worse ? China is on the offensive . They 're positioning their military to blow the alien vessel right out of the sky . And if this happens , we can 't sit around waiting for retaliation . So ... get prepared . The Air Force and Infantry are standing by . Yes , sir . Tonight , China becomes the first world power to declare war against the aliens . Following the failure of diplomatic efforts of the United Nations , China has confirmed that its language experts have tonight delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site . In a televised statement , General Shang , Chairman of the People 's Liberation Army , said the aliens have 24 hours to leave Chinese territory , or face destruction . And he urged all other world leaders to unite with China and take a similar stance . With a huge build up of forces at their landing sites , Pakistan , Russia and Sudan are thought to be following China 's lead . [ NAVY MOBILIZED IN EAST CHINA SEA ] It can 't be random . Its going to take us years . What 's this term here ? Mum . - Mum . - Hm ? - Sweetie ? - What 's this term ... for that thing , like a technical term ... Where we make a deal and we both get something out of it ? - A compromise ? - No ... - Like it 's a competition , - M-hm ... But both sides end up happy . Like a win-win ? More sciencey than that . If you want science , call your father . Thank you . Sorry . It 's OK . What time is it ? It 's time to open that bottle , you 've been hiding . You cracked something , didn 't you ? Yeah . C 'mere . Take a look at this section . It seems to be talking about time . Their symbol for time is everywhere . So what is this ? A formula for faster than light travel ? Who can tell ? There are too many gaps . Nothing 's complete . Then it dawned on me . Right here . Stop focusing on the ones . Look at the zeroes . How much of this is data ? How much of it is negative space ? So , I measured it . .0833 recurring . Perhaps you 'd like that as a fraction . 1 of 12 . What they 're saying right here is that this is one of twelve . We are part of a larger whole . Or we 're 1 of 12 contestants for the prize . - Why do I have to talk to him ? - We 're all working together here . We need to talk to the other sites . We need to help them with what they got from the other heptopods . In case you don 't remember , we 're blacked out . China just threatened to destroy their shell . We 're on our own . But it says that all the pieces fit together . And I 'm telling you that no one else cares . Two hours ago we pulled this audio off a secure channel in Russia . Someone from the science team there was broadcasting live . In their final session , the aliens said , " There is no time . Many become one . " I feel we have all been given weapons . If anyone is receiving this ... Please ... Well , I mean ... There are a lot of ways you can interpret what he said . I don 't need an interpreter to know what this means . Russia just executed one of their own experts to keep their secret . " Many become one " could just be their way of saying , " some assembly required " . Why hand it out to us in pieces ? Why not justgive it all over ? What better way to force us to work together for once ? Even if I did believe you , how in the world are you gonna get anybody else to play along , and give up their data ? We offer ours in return . Yeah . - What , trade ? - Its a non zero-sum game . Non zero-sum game . That 's it , yeah . Thanks . 9 of the landing sites have gone total comms blackout .

Thank you . 18 months ago , you did something remarkable . Something not even my superior has done . - What 's that ? - You changed my mind . You 're the reason for this unification . All because you reached out to me on my private number . Your private number ? General I don 't know your private number . Now you know . I do not claim to know how your mind works , but ...

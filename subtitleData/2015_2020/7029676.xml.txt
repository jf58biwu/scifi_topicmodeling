So you can stroll into another ambush , Colonel Custer ? There was no way to know . - No ? - No . - Did you scout the campsite first ? - Dad . Huh ? Hike the perimeter ? Or did you suffer some distraction ? Were your already tasting the blood ? It wasn 't Troy 's fault . Oh , you an expert ? No , we ... we were cautious . Ah . Well , let 's extend the caution now . We 're not attacking . We 're right to hold off , but Walker 's not going away . He 's weak . That chickenshit atrocity he pulled with Phil ... If he 's weak , he 'll negotiate . Negotiate ? There 's nothing to negotiate . It 's our land or their land . I mean , we either stole it or we didn 't . Stole ? Is this their land ? Every acre you tread is owned and was owned before ... bought , leased , or stolen in between . And what about the ranch ? It was sold to my forebears . And what the hell does it matter now ? It matters if he doesn 't stop . It matters if your people think they 're on the wrong side . Hey , this is my business to manage . Don 't mistake yourself or your place . Dad , she 's trying to understand . Walker 's a tribal lawyer . Sued us since forever . I handled it last couple years . And we beat him every time . And what if he comes back to the door now ? He won 't . You 've never seen the Black Hat Reservation . - Mm-mm . - It 's a truck stop , motel , and market . Rocks and asphalt , liquor and oxy , drunken , diabetic welfare cheats . I feel your liberal judgment . It 's palpable . - But that 's not racism . - Isn 't it ? No . It 's truth . And I 'm talking about before the apocalypse . Doubt it 's improved much since . You say what you want , but the man I saw yesterday was a threat . He had command . Yeah ? You got a little crush ? We gotta tell people something . You talk to them . It 's good they start hearing more from you anyway , Jake . What do you want me to say ? Just say we got weapons and walls and wherewithal . Say all civilizations are born of violence . People give me a headache . Troy should come with me . He was there , Da ... - Got it ? - Okay . I got it , I got it . I 've got it . Okay . - Here , take this off . - Oh , God . Thank you . - Here . - Careful . Oh , Mom ... Oh , God . Damn . She went south . She knew people in Mexicali . I 'm sorry . She 's strong . So are you . Hey ! Hey . Sorry ... about the people you lost . I didn 't know most of them . Phil McCarthy was here since the beginning , but ... he wasn 't a good man . Your mom okay ? Will be . Your dad ? No . Not really , no . He 's one of the last ones standing . And he 's feeling that . Russell lost in the fire , McCarthy dead now . Vernon 's the only other Founding Father left . Just getting picked off one by one . Are you afraid ? No . Border 's a violent place , always has been . Show me ? Safety . Semi-auto , like a pistol . Full auto . Stick with semi . Don 't I need a new target ? Mine 'll be the ones in the bulls-eye . What happens when your dad goes ? Who takes over the ranch ? Most people here are libertarians . They don 't take orders very well . Tuck the stock into your shoulder . Don 't tense . Yeah , but people look up to your dad . Yeah , it was his land . It 'll pass to me and Troy when he dies , but people look to whoever they feel is worth looking to . Could be anybody . Could be you . Your father wants it to be you . Why wouldn 't it be ? You 're right , people are gonna look to somebody . And if it 's not you ... Breathe out when you squeeze the trigger . Come in . Sorry , Madison , sorry . I was just looking for Alicia . She 's out and about , Gretchen . Probably with Jake . I 'll ... I 'll just ... Is Mike okay ? Freaked . He said you saved him , though . He said everybody would have died without you . Come in . It isn 't just my brother . It 's my whole family , my father . Vernon ? Sit down . My dad doesn 't think we 're safe . He helped make this place , and he doesn 't think it 's safe . I 've never seen him scared , not even when the dead rose . - But he is . - What 'd he say ? He said he should have known , that it would never end , - that violence begets violence . - Wait , wait , slow down , slow down . He said it 's just starting . He wants to go . He wants to leave the ranch . I 'm scared . Shh , listen to me . There 's no place safer than here . Well , he doesn 't believe that . He knows a colony in Colorado . Dad says the Rockies will be safe , at elevation . Who did he say that to ? Anyone who will listen . He feels responsible . He 's a founder . Fire ! Fire ! We got fire ! What 's happening ? Everybody out ! No , they 're everywhere ! They 're all over the place ! Son of a bitch . 50 yards from the front gate . What the hell was that sentry doing ? How many total ? Militia counts about 20 . All built to die like this one . It 's not meant to burn us out . They want the land in one piece . They want us off of it , like they said . They don 't have the arms or the balls , so they do this bullshit . If Walker was gonna come , he would have . But he can 't . Your people are scared , Jeremiah . ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Whoa , whoa , whoa . What brings you down here ? Uh , lumber ? Drywall screws . You flying solo ? - What ? - Luciana , she , uh ... she take off ? Do me a favor . Say her name again . Whoa , whoa , easy , easy , partner . It 's just good you didn 't take off after her . That 's all I 'm saying . Okay ? Whoa , Dax , Dax , what are you doing ? - Huh ? - Don 't start , Troy . No , this is not a good time to cut bait , Mrs. Daley . Feels like the best time . I have sacrificed too much . Not gonna wait for them to finish off my entire family . They will pay . They will pay for whathey did . Now , Dax ... put the flour back . I 'm sorry Troy . We 've just been thinking ... Thinking ? Thinking ? Thinking about stealing our shit and hauling ass ? Huh ? This is what we put in . Following the rules here . Oh , the rules . Right , the rules . Well , the rules are here for the members of our community . You leave , you 're not a member . Take it up with your father . We spoke this morning . All right . Okay . We should talk . Um , should we ? I may disappoint . - Listen , Vernon is ... - Wha ... Headaches still ? Migraines . You get ' em ? Unh-unh . Father did . The light would start to hurt him . - Oh . - Jeremiah ... What did you wanna say about Vernon ? - He 's ... - Right here . - Jeremiah , can I get a word ? - Hmm ? Yeah . You 're having one . Uh , in private . There 's nothing you can 't say in front of Madison or anybody else . Look , we 're friends going on 30 years . You know I love this place . I love , what we started . But a man 's family comes first . Just gotta protect them best he knows how , and the best I know how is to leave . Now . A little precipitous , don 't you think ? Run off at the first sign of trouble ? Sign of trouble ? They killed eight of ours . They sawed Phil 's ... Hell , Otto , that could 've been ... All right , all right . All right ? Well , what do you want me to say ? You don 't need my permission . You wanna go , go . You don 't wanna go out there , Mr. Trimbol . My mind 's made up . I 'm sorry , Jeremiah . Mike going with you ? My family 's leaving , Troy . 30 years , huh ? He wasn 't always like that . Some men , they have kids , turns them into women . He 's a founder . If you can 't keep him here , how you gonna keep the rest of them ? Well , what would you have me do , hmm ? Give them a reason to stay , fight . Give them a reason ? Aside from the fences and the militia and the stores and this community , huh ? I welcome them onto my land with open arms , and now I gotta get down on my hands and knees and beg ' em to stay ? There 's a fight coming . Everyone who leaves leaves us weaker . To hell with this . Troy ! Keep that gate closed , Jimmy ! - Your father gave the okay . - I don 't give a damn . You open that gate and I shoot you in the head . Open the door . - I 'm not doing this , Troy . - Open the door , Vernon . Mike ? Mike , get your ass out here now . Come on , get your ass out here . People died for us , Mike ! Our people , and you 're gonna run , huh ? ! - It 's not what a man does , Mike ! - Troy . Troy ! Troy , stand down . Dad said they could leave . Yeah , he said they could leave , not with ranch property . What property ? This is theirs . They gassed up , didn 't they ? Gas is ranch property . And I guarantee you that they took plenty of shit from the pantry ! And I want to see an inventory , Vernon ! - I want it inspected ! - This is not what Dad wants . Why should I give a damn what Dad wants ? He never gives a shit about me ... You 're not protecting the ranch . The hell do you know about it ? You haven 't a clue what this ranch is about . I mean , she 's been here a week , and she gets it . You gonna fight for what 's yours or you gonna surrender it , huh ? You fight for ... cylinder . - That 's not your call , is it ? - You gonna fight or you gonna surrender ? You 're not in charge , are you ? What the hell is wrong with you , huh ? - No ! Hey , Dad , Dad . Dad , Dad . - No , no ! Come on . Come on . God damn it . Looking for something to take out the old man ? I 've been there . It 's the first thing folks will grab if there 's a run on the place . Good . I was worried you might do something rash . To my family ? No , no . Never . Can 't blame my worry . No . All I 've ever had in my ... my whole life is this ... this place and ... these people , and ... I don 't know , it just ... I don 't understand , you know . Like , the world out there , it 's , uh ... it 's burned . They wanted to see for themselves . Anyone who leaves is dead to me . Now , Mike , he was ... he was soft , but he was ... he 's been my friend since I was a kid . He stayed in school when I got ... I got pulled . But he never quit on me . Never . Even when others did . He didn 't quit on you , Troy . He just stood by his family . He wouldn 't look at me . He just ... Hard to know how to react to something like that . You make sure no one else leaves . Save them from the same mistake . I 'll help you . I want you all at attention . All right . That 's a start . Tracking Mike down and beating his ass into the ground , that 'd be a start . No , Mike 's gone . He 's not coming back . That 's the end of it . I don 't want to hear his name again . From now on , we set an example . We become a model of what this place needs ... order , discipline , chain of command . We have to make those people up there feel safe . Or they 'll leave , all of them . We have to defend this ranch with our lives or they will be slaughtered , all of them . This place , this place is all we have . And right now , it is ... teetering . And the only thing that can save it is us . Now , I 'm not gonna draw a line on the floor . I 'm not asking whether you 're with me . You are with me , all of you . Do you understand ? All : Yes , sir ! Jeremiah , what are you doing ? This is where it goes , right here . Where the hell have you been , huh ? I 've been drinking here all night , alone . Here . No , thanks . Come on . You ? Especially me . I 'm high on life . I like that . Hey , slow down . - Slow down . - Mm . Ah . What happened to your hand ? Oh ... you know that song , " Can 't be with the one you love , love the one you 're with " ? Well , that goes the same ... with hitting people . I don 't mind . The-The-The hand ... distracts from the headaches . Well , listen , man , tomorrow 's another day , a better day , 'cause you 're gonna be too hung over to get in any fights . So why don 't you just crash here ? This is a scared spot , you know . Me and Vern and Russell and McCarthy , we sat here one night and ... conceived the movement . My life 's work . Now two are dead and ... one is dead to me . God damn it , man . Jeremiah , no , no , no , hey ! I 'm s ... I 'm sorry . Your home . Your gun . There 's blood in it . It 's in the earth . It 's in the earth . Bible study ? Jake 's . Jake ? It 's nothing serious . The rhythm method is bullshit . I told you that , right ? Yes , when I was 13 . I thought you were talking about a band . There 's birth control in the pantry . I 'm sorry , it 's just the stakes are so much higher now . You like him ? Like , yeah . I 'm not in love . Been in love . This isn 't it . It can creep up on you . Jake 's important to us . And I like him . In that order ? Does there have to be an order ? Oh , God damn . It 's bright . Good morning . So , I raided the pantry . Turns out " It 's for Otto " goes a long way . No , thanks . About last night ... Last night I was at the bunkhouse with my mom and Alicia . Why , did I miss anything ? How long has that been there ? Is it one of ours ? It 's Vern 's . - Go get your mother . - Why ? Just go get your mother . That 's a baby . They could have let it out . It 's a long way to go . Two horses , a lot of feed , lot of water . They 'd have slaughtered it . They 'd have killed it if it were like that . Treat the hide . Cure the meat . They wouldn 't just free it . So it escaped . They 're dead . I know it . It 's just a question of how they got that way . Be ready for that . " Black Hat Reservation " ? I 'm going to Walker . I 'm gonna work this out . I 've known him for years . I know Black Hat . - You need a map to get there ? - No . I 'm going off-grid . Back way . It 'll take longer , but it 's safer . - Safer from Walker . - Safer from my fatherstop me . in case he sends Troy to me . He should stop you . He killed your people . He killed Travis . He wasn 't trying to kill Travis . No , he was trying to kill you . Yeah , good people die easy as bad . - What does that even mean ? - It 's what I 'm trying to stop . More people will die . You 're right , I ... I have to be more than just a voice in my father 's ear . I meant for you to step up inside the camp , Jake , not to go out on some suicide mission . I 'm the only one that can do this . I 've dealt with him . I 've settled with him . - I 've beaten him . - When there were courts ! When there was rule of law ! Walker 's not crazy . He 's just fighting for his people who need him , people who always got a raw deal . Jake , I 'm asking you not to go . Stay ready . Lots of dead wander around out here . Vernon ? Kathy , too . Mike . You gonna shoot ? You all right ? She 's Alicia 's age . Yeah . He thinks it was Troy . No , I don 't think so . Don 't think so or you don 't want to ? Even for Troy , this is ... We know Walker was close . I 've seen what he 's done . Indians , right ? Took everything ? Took the helicopter ? - Even took your shoes ? - Yeah . Would they leave this ? Horses ? The RV ? There 's a week 's worth of food and supplies in there . All the things he 's done ... never anything like this . Not to his own people . Can 't be absolutely sure . I don 't think of him as a man . My boys , they go away a couple days , they come to mind . It 's like they 're seven , eight years old again . I don 't know what to do . We have to go back . Now . Troy ! What happened to them ? I 'm sorry . They were good people . They didn 't deserve this end . Our family , we ... we weren 't prepared like you . We were strangers , but you took us in . We 've come to love it here . I wish ... my husband had lived to see it . But he was killed . Travis was killed . He was killed by the same people who killed Phil and our people at the outpost . The same people ... Walker 's people ... have now killed our friends ... Vernon , Kathy , Mike ... - Gretchen . - This is crazy , dude . I 've seen firsthand how Walker treats his victims . I saw it at the outpost , and I just now saw it again . You built this place together . Because of that , you 've been safe and sheltered . You haven 't been out in the world . We have . I 'm telling you , there 's nothing out there . If you leave , you 'll die . Walker 's people aren 't strong enough to force us off this land . They 're trying to scare us . That 's how they want us to go ... a family or two at a time , out there alone where nobody can see , where our militia can 't protect us . We cannot let ourselves be fractured . There are more of us . We 're better armed . If we stay here together , we live . Yes . Yeah . That was impressive as all hell . It was necessary . How do you tell a lie that big and sleep at night ? How do you do that ? What I said was true . None of these folks will die , not tonight , not tomorrow , maybe not for a long time . You and Alicia are safe . I 'll sleep like a baby . Say it was Troy . It was . No one would believe us . They 're more afraid of what 's out there than anything he could do . You should 've told me first before you did this . You would 've said no . No . I get it . I hate it , I get it . I would have backed you like I 'm backing you now . Just don 't forget what he is . I didn 't go out there to do that , I swear . I ... He owed me . He had to look me directly in the eye . He had to say it to my face , say it like Vernon said it to my father . He owed me that . He didn 't want to do that , did he ? He said some things , and ... I did some things . Then it went bad . Not what you want to hear , is it ? You could run this place , Troy , but not if you let things break like that . Last night you had command . I saw that . Your militia saw that , and they responded . Your brother doesn 't have what you have . He 's not of this place . You 're the survivor . You 're the heir . So , no , the last thing I want to hear is how you lost control . That can 't happen . ♪ ♪ I don 't care how you did it . I don 't care why you did it . All I care about is that you can control it . There 's a fight coming , and you have to save us . Can you ? Yes , Ma 'am . ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

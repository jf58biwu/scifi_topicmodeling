 Ali , we 're going to break even in months . We should have been drug dealers years ago . They sold the drugs through a soap store . I need you to tell me that Delphine is alive . I saw her get shot . Your sisters . I know how they feel sometimes . - Those aren 't dreams . - Thought my DNA - was supposed to make it better . - Takes time to develop a therapy . Share the Original 's genome and together we can make a cure . You bartered my mother behind my back . Cosima needs a cure . I need this bug out of my face . There 's some kind of Trojan wiping our research . Everything is gone . - Clones are obsolete . - These shites aren 't worth the salt . Oh , my God ! Hello ? It 's over . Where are we ? What is this place ? It used to be the edge of the known world . Still is . Welcome to The Island of Dr. Moreau . What are you talking about ? Why have you let me out ? The Original is destroyed , Rachel . The cure along with it . - Mum ... - I 'll speak . - Alright . - You put my mother in the line of fire . Laid your moves without me and then you put me in the middle and you made it my fault . And now I don 't even have a body to bury . She was my blood too . You came to me an orphan . That 's all you 'll ever be . Then I don 't need to stay here , do I ? No . You 're not taking Kira where you 're going . - You don 't know where I 'm going . - I know too well . Kira stays with me . No tears , Cosima . Hey . What 's up ? You OK ? She had her killed right in front of me . She kept me alive so I could tell everybody that Kendall 's ... gone and Delphine 's dead . It 's not your fault , OK ? I got your favourite . Bad coffee and a good croissant . I pushed Sarah to make that deal . I ... pushed us right into Evie 's trap . She killed our hope , Scott . What are you doing over there ? I 'm going to power up again . - Why ? There 's nothing left . - Well , we 'll see . Oh , Lord . I know I 've been a horrible sinner , but we need hope now . We need ... Oh , fudge ! - Fudge it , fudge me . - Honey ? Honey ? - Scheisse , Donnie . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Come here . Come here . - We 're gonna get through this . - Mm-hmm . You take whatever time you need for the sisters . - I got you covered . - Thank you . Thank you , Donnie . But hey , I think maybe we should cancel Gemma 's slumber party . No , no . It 's her birthday . I 've made all the arrangements , Donnie . Honey , it 's too soon . We can come up with an excuse and we 'll have cake with her ourselves . No , Gemma needs this night . It 's important that we make this normal now , for the kids . There are hot dogs in the freezer , Mister . I 'm putting my foot down . You can 't just capitulate to Evie Cho . Leda is the cornerstone of Neolution . I was going to show you this when I came back with the Original . There 's no point in hiding it any longer . Very few people are privy to the true history of Neolution . We date back to the Victorians , to this man . Percival Westmorland ? The industrialist ? Born to industry , drawn to Darwin and early eugenical thought . He used his resources to essentially create a secret scientific society . Percy sought to bring science to the task of breeding a better human . You 're sleeping in his very room . Over a century ago , he built the facilities downstairs . I built on top of him . And now , Evie Cho builds on top of me . I gave up everything to continue his legacy : Ethan , you . - And now my time is over . - How can you give up ? I 'm recovering , like you wanted . I want to take my place with you . We still need to find a cure . Look what you 've done for me . Look at my eye . It 's almost perfect . But I 'm afraid Evie has usurped us . In the 20-odd years since I landed on your doorstep , I 've only seen you cry a handful of times . Now would be appropriate , if you like . Will you get me another cup of tea , love ? Of course . Where 's Sarah ? She 's gone . Did she go out ? Mummy left again . No ... She doesn 't do that anymore . She did . No , not like before . 'Cause that 's not an option , is it ? Your Mum can look after herself . She 's well good at that . Darling , you listen to me . Don 't listen to S. You listen to your little heart , 'cause I 'm going to go find her . Alright ? Mm-hmm . OK . You should know better . Everything is going to get worse if Sarah goes off the rails . You like it or not , she 's the glue holding us all together . Hey ! Two more . Is anything recoverable ? The malware did exactly what they intended ... completely obliterated your data . Evie 's covered her bases . Without Kendall , without our research on the synthetic sequences , we have nothing . - We 're back to square one . - We still have a live vector . Which didn 't work . Every single test failed . Why would we repeat an experiment if we don 't even know what the flaw is ? We don 't know if we have the right sequences , or if it 's even the right vector . So , let 's think outside the box . There you go , listen to your lab partner . Yeah , she 's dead , too . - No offense , Scotty . - Some taken , actually . So there 's got to be something you haven 't thought of . - What the heck is that ? - Sarah 's bot . I poached it from Evie 's office . Hey there , little buddy . I wonder if you can tell us anything . Cosima said the man who pulled the trigger was tall , bearded . She thought maybe the detective you tied to Beth . Martin Duko . Beth 's union steward . Does he work for Evie Cho ? He 's the one who put Beth under Evie 's thumb . Drove her to try and kill Susan . Thank you , Arthur . For sticking with us . Evie , it 's the big day . Congratulations . Your science has won . Looks like just in time , Dr. Van Leer . Shingles . Yes . A side effect of leaning on immunosuppressants - most of my life . - Well ... you 've brought gene therapy a long way , miles since we treated you when you were a teenager , Evie . Miles ? Ian , you 've always said this is a science of nanometres . I am so proud of you . You have pending approval for the world 's first gene therapy implant . It 's affordable , it 's effective ... So good , even the Brightborn CEO is doing it . You 'll be first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . And so will human clones . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm fine , Mother . I 'm just glad you 'll be here to share in my retirement . Yes , it 's fortunate you found such an ineffective means of suicide , Ira . - Rachel ! - It 's alright . Let 's just not talk about it anymore . Are we ready ? - Susan . - Evie . Laura . Raymond . I thought it fitting that Rachel represent Leda in transition . I was wondering when you 'd show up , Rachel . Yes , I ... Cat got your tongue ? That 's okay . It 's just a courtesy call . So ... the architecture of Neolution is under our control . Finance and Legal are backing my patents now . After investing billions ... Squandering , for years . Leda will be dismantled for its assets , the monitor program terminated . - And my subjects ? - Naive clones are being cut loose . No need for a Helsinki event . Their days are numbered anyway . However , Sarah and her self-aware sisters are still a threat . They won 't get such humane treatment . I can help with that . We 're fine , Rachel . I 'm not my sisters . I 'm Neolution bred . Do you actually think Neolution would let a clone take a position of real importance ? Cheers . - Hey now . - Oi ! See , it 's one thing to show up on my doorstep looking for a favour , but my local 's another story . I should 've known this was the kind of shithole - that you would inhabit . - Hey now , a man 's watering hole is sacred . I 'm here for this , that 's it . Don 't worry . Well , cheers . Cheers . Did you find out anything more about that implant ? What did I just say to you ? Well , what do we talk about , then , if not - clones and conspiracies ? - I dunno . Titillate me . Slippery Nipple ? - Slippery what ? - Nipple . It 's a kind of shot . But this is just bourbon . Bourbon 's my drink . Is that your friend over there ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's Tito . I 'm Elle . - You want to introduce us ? - I 'd love to . - Come over . - You coming or what ? Yeah . Wouldn 't wanna miss anything . OK , the kids will be here any second , Donnie , so if you could be of some assistance ? Ali . Ali , Gemma will still love you even if the decorations aren 't symmetrical . Please don 't . Please . I know you 're just trying to be strong , but I really want you to be able to talk to someone . Even if that isn 't me . What does that mean ? I invited Reverend Mike over to help with the ghost stories . - Ahoy there ! - Hi ! - Hendrixes ? - I 'm not prepared for this . - Hi . - Hi ! I come bearing gifts and , well , tidings of great joy . Oh , I see that . Thank you , Reverend . Oh , Alison . So how are you ? Well , what a treat ! Woo ! Oh , I think someone 's enjoying their holiday . You know what , Elle ? I am . I am enjoying it , yeah . What part of London are you from ? I 'm from right here , right now . - I like this one , Elle . - Yeah ? Yeah . What 's your story ? Well , I 'm a clone . There 's 22 of me going around out there . Let 's dance . - You just said the magic words . - Hey , you gonna dance , or what ? - No , Dizzy don 't dance . - What ? Hey ! OK , uh ... It 's almost jim-jam time . And that means parents have to leave . That 's right , because my ghost stories are not for grownups . Mwah ha ha ha ! Do you want a little referee ? Want a soccer ball ? I want a soccer boot . OK . There 's a whole plate full of those upstairs there , - grumpy little birthday girl . - There isn 't . - They 're all burnt . - OK , you know what ? You want soccer boots , you go upstairs and you make a plate for your friends and you give them out . - OK . - Egads . - Kids ' parties , huh ? - Yeah . I had a migraine this morning , so it 's just a bad mix . Do you want to hear some good news ? The pageant is finished , so our stage is finally free for the Hendrix-Stubbs musical revue . Oh , wonderful ! Mike , you 're a literal Godsend . I hear you 've been having a ... real difficult time lately , Ali . No . No , no , no , no . It 's nothing insurmountable . Hey ! Have you seen this girl ? No ? Hey , man ! Have you seen this girl ? Oi , hey . Have you seen this girl ? Come on , mate . Look at her . She 's a pretty good-looking type . Judging by your accent , I 'd say you 're related . Oh , yeah ? You look like her type on a bender . Have you seen her ? No . But if I do , who should I say is calling on her ? Tell her to call her brother , yeah ? And not to piss about , 'cause it concerns her daughter . - She has a daughter ? - Yeah . Sometimes . Where 'd the Lieutenant say he wanted to meet ? OK . No , thank you , Sandy . Yeah , I 'm on my way there now . That was for Kendall Malone . And this is for Beth . You frickin ' psycho . You killed for them ! And all Beth wanted was the truth ! That 's it , Arthur . Gimme the shoe leather ! Got that out of your system ? That 's pretty much all you can do about that . No . See , Duko , we 're just getting started . What are you gonna do ? You 're gonna bring them all down ? Yeah , starting with you , then Evie Cho . You can 't stop them . They 're watching you ... Collaborating with Sarah . Abetting the Hendrixes . And what about Beth 's shooting ? The cellphone in the victim 's hand . Who really put that there ? They 're coming for you , Arthur . And the only question you really should be asking yourself right now is , is where is that next blow going to land ? How about right here ? The island is really big . How big ? As big as a country . We 're in the fort , and beyond the walls , there 's monsters . I 'm afraid we 're the only monsters here , and it isn 't an island . It 's more of a prison for us . That 's silly . You 're a big girl . You need to know the truth . You and I have a problem . One that we share with Ira . What is it ? You 're sick . You 've already displayed symptoms . That 's why Susan 's been testing you . I always have tests , Rachel . It 's nothing to worry about . Yes , it is . There is no cure . I 'm sorry , Charlotte . You 're dying , and one day I will be too . As Julia crept down the dark hallway towards the back door , she heard it again ... the knocking . And there , on the back step , was her brother , Ryan . His face was white , like he had seen a ghost ... or was he a ghost ? Oh , hey ! It 's you . You 're still here . Yes , I am . Got a problem with that ? Are you like , her boyfriend or something ? We met earlier and we decided to have an open relationship . Well , whatever your kink is , why don 't you just piss off ? Oi . Don 't tell my mate Dizzy to piss off . Piss . Off . - OK , what ? - Whoa , easy . - Wanker ! - Don 't touch her . - Just relax ... - Come here . Come here ! - Why are you scared , you ... - Come on , come on ! No , you come here ! Behind your mistress ? Little wanker ! Oh , yeah . Great , great . Get the cops down here now . It 's like babysitting some football hooligan . West Ham ! West Ham ! Sing it ! West Ham ! - That 's enough . - Yeah ? Alright . Where 's our next drink coming from ? Yours ? - What 's that ? - Something to take you down - a bit . - Is that what you need ? Listen , I can be honest if you can . Ugh , he wants to talk . I didn 't help you find M.K. out of the goodness of my heart , alright ? I have a friend whose name is Ed . He had one of those implants in too . He was freaking out , trying to get rid of it , and they , uh ... they killed him . Is that Ed Capra ? That 's right . How 'd you know him ? You need to stop talking now . Alright , I can do that . Hey . Hey . Hey , your implant . It 's gone . How 'd you get rid of it ? I said I 'm off the clock , didn 't I ? Sarah , come on . I 'm out . I don 't fancy you either , mate . OK , never mind that for a second , but just listen . My friend Ed wasn 't the only one with one of those things driving him crazy . - You know how to get rid of it . - I don 't know anything ! Alright ? I wanted a bit of fun , you can 't even get it up . Wanker ! - Stop following me ! - I 'm not ! You 're in my place ! Jesus Christ . The ball of fire made the ghosts explode ! And suddenly , Julia found herself safe in her bed , away from all the ghosts . She was drifting off to sleep when she heard ... at her chamber door . - What happens , daddy ? - The door swung open and it was the ghost , holding ... a birthday cupcake ! - OK , that 's weird . - I 'll get it . - Is it the ghost ? - It might be the ghost , yeah . - With a birthday cupcake ? - With a birthday cupcake . - I 'm gonna eat it . - Police ! - Donald Hendrix ? - Yes ? - Oh , my God . - You 're under arrest . - What are you doing ? - Down ! Get down on the ground ! Get ' em up ! Get down on the floor . What is this about ? It 's a children 's slumber party ! You 're under arrest for trafficking narcotics . You have the right to obtain an attorney . Get up ! - Come on ! - ... one will be provided . - Oh , my God . - Honey ? Call someone ! I don 't know , I don 't know who . Maybe Uncle ... Alison . Where are they taking my husband ? He 's gonna be fine . I 'm taking your husband downtown and you and I , we are going to need to keep in touch . How are you holding up ? Kendall was quite a loss . Hey , chicken . You OK ? I 'm fine . No , you 're not . None of us are . Is it really Mum 's fault Granny died ? It 's a whole lot more complicated than that . Mummy thinks it 's her fault . That 's why she ran away . But she 'll be back . No , she won 't . This time she 's following Beth . Amazing , how it healed itself . OK . So we compared Sarah 's DNA pre and post-bot . - We couldn 't see any change . - Susan said it was looking for the gene that controls the clone disease , - flipping switches on and off . - You think there 's a chance it could turn it off in you ? That 's crazy . It could just as easily turn something else against you . I know , it 's too risky . Plus , we wouldn 't even know how to implant it . Cut a hole in my face and stick it in ? Probably not . Hell-Wiz ordered some food . C 'mon , let 's eat . Hey , Cosima . Got your favourite . There 's spirulina in the smoothie too . Aw , awesome . Thanks , guys . Um ... I 'm just gonna grab my ... Hey . Cosima ? Cosima , what are you doing ? - What are you doing ? - Trying to buy a train ticket . I want out and I don 't even have a credit card . Here . Use mine . Oh , wait , you maxed it out already . Ha ha ha . It 's OK , I didn 't need it anymore . I never knew you were funny . That 's a relief . Oh , shit . I 'm talking to a dead person . You gonna follow me for the rest of my life ? Tonight 's our last night , I hope . Cosima ! Cosima , please ! Open up the door ! Cosima ! Cosima , open the door ! - Cosima ... - Leave me alone , Scotty . Cosima , come on . Think for a second . You 've got no idea what this thing is going to do to you . It 's risk versus reward . In this case , the risk is so high , the reward is my death helps the sisters understand the disease . I didn 't want this . I didn 't want you . I didn 't want any bloody sisters ! You hear me ? Leave me alone ! I wish you had just ... What ? What are you looking at ? ! Hey ? ! Piss off . We would have been better off if we never crossed paths . Goddammit , I 'm so mashed ! How mashed did you have to get to kill yourself , Beth ? It 's only , like , 40 feet down . If you screw that up , you might just end up like Rachel . So now you 're worried about Sarah ? Felix , Kira said something . You know the way she is ? She said Sarah is following Beth . Mum ! This is what I was talking about . This is what I tried to tell you . Now will you just ... Hang on . - - Scott ? Hello ? Cosima 's locked herself in the lab . And I think she might do something medically crazy to herself . Like what , Scott ? What ? I have multiple emergencies right now , so just tell me . She 's at the end of her rope , Felix . She blames herself for Kendall . She blames herself for Delphine . Delphine ? ! Oh , my God , Krystal ! I 'm such an idiot . I completely forgot ! Scott , OK . Tell her to pick up the phone . Please . Cosima ! Just keep going toward the train station . Thank you . I 'm looking for someone . Cosima , Felix is calling . Pick up ! Cosima , open the door ! Ah ! Cosima ! Come on . Pick up your phone , Cosima . Pick up your bloody phone . Dude , I think we way overbuilt that . Cosima , answer your phone ! You need to talk to Felix ! Krystal told him something important ! Not a good time , Felix . Whatever cracked-out science thing you 're about to do , I need you to stop and I need you to listen to me , because this is about Delphine . What about her ? Somehow , during Krystal 's misguided but oddly effective investigation , she found herself on the trail of Delphine . Now , she saw her get shot , and that 's bad . But Cosima , she saw someone else pick her up . And Delphine was alive when they took her away . Cosima ? We 're going to figure it out , OK ? - Thank you . - We 're in this together . Just hang on . Shit . Shit . Hey , stop the car , please . Stop . Cosima , I gotta go . Can you just pull up over here , please ? Thank you . There 's more than biology between us , Sarah . There 's something else . You can feel it too . Oi , Sarah . This isn 't the way , is it ? You gotta be stronger than her , Sarah . Bring us together , Sarah . We need you . - Hello , Kira . - Who are you ? - How do you know my name ? - Don 't worry . I 'm a friend . You 're the girl in the shadows . Am I ? You can call me Mika . Good morning ! Susan ? Is anybody there ? Dear God . Rachel ? Ira ! Ira , did you see it ? What happened ? - You must have hit your head . - It looked at me . I ... I saw something in my eye . What a fine pair we are , aren 't we ?

 I 've just been advised by our group that we are deploying six members of law enforcement and two canine dogs to aid ... Another day of searching in the desert for clues in the case of three missing teens . Multiple law enforcement agencies are here . Well , there 's still volunteers continuing the search , the satellite images ... So anyone with any information at all ... doubled since yesterday . As more time goes on , they 're really pushing their resources to make sure these teenagers are found .

Anyone with any information at all , we 're asking you to please call a special tip line . Searching in the desert for clues in the case of three missing teens . Search efforts have doubled since yesterday . As more time goes on , they 're really pushing their resources to make sure these teenagers are found . We will continue to return here until we 've completely exhausted everything that we think we need to do . There are still volunteers continuing the search , uh , and satellite imaging is ongoing . Arizona State Police are now in their third week searching for missing teenagers Ashley Foster , Mark Abrams , and Josh Bishop . Well ... sold . Yeah . You don 't want to come in ? I ... No , I-I better not . - Just , uh , say hi to mom for me . - Okay . - Okay ? - Yeah . - I 'll talk to you later . - Okay . Bye . Well , I like your bangs . - You 're so cute ! - Mom ! While you 're here , you 've got to go through everything , - or else I 'm giving it to the yard sale . - Okay . - Okay ? - I 'm fine , okay . I don 't need my blankie . Well , as you can see , um ... what 's the point of redecorating ? While you 're here , I was hoping you could help me pick up this stuff . I have a ton of boxes in the garage and between the two of us it shouldn 't take us ... Do you still have the tapes ? - This is it , huh ? - Yeah . That 's the one . That 's ... how it all started . Oh , it 's your turn . Sit down next to your sister . Come on . Now you know how I feel . - Okay . Okay . - I want you to , uh , say something very sweet to your sister . A nice wish for her sixth year of life . Go . Okay . Well , Sophie , I have one thing to say to you ... Wow . Look at this . Whoa ! Is that an airplane ? I don 't know . Oh ! Josh ! Careful ! It 's bright . Hold on . I don 't think it 's an airplane . - Hmm . - Huh . Oh , look at that ! A fourth one ! They 're in formation of some kind , but they 're not really moving . - Whoa ! - Whoa ! Five , six , seven lights . Have you guys ever seen anything like this before ? - Hey ! - You see that . You see that ? What is that ? - On , my God . - What is that ? That 's definitely not a plane . That 's one object . - Wow , I 've never seen anything like it . - Oh , my God ! - Honey , zoom in on it . - I 'm zooming , Mom . Okay . Okay . Whoa ! - Whoa ! - They 're aliens or something . - They 're gone . - That 's weird . What was that ? I don 't know . - Where did they go ? - They 're gone . Maybe they ... they could have gone behind the mountain maybe . - No , there 's no clouds ! - Yeah , we saw the same thing . - That was interesting . - That was a show , right ? - Yeah , right ? - Guys , you know what that was ? - Those were UFOs ! - Oh , come on . Those were UFOs ! That 's what a UFO is ! You guys , I think that 's our cue to clean up . - We gotta ... Right ? Come on . - Are you kidding me ? Dad ! Yeah , it was probably , urn ... I don 't know , military . Yeah , we 've got to get the presents , Josh . Josh , put the camera down - and just help your mother clean up , okay ? - Soph ... what do you think that was ? I don 't know ! Holy moly . You okay , Soph ? You all right ? Yeah . That was the Air Force , Dad ! Well , I hope it was our Air Force . Grandpa . That was amazing ! When these lights appeared over Phoenix , UFOs . Outer space . - We were standing about here ? - Right about here . - Whoa ! - Whoa ! They went just over the valley toward South Mountain in like a ... What seemed to be a " V " formation , - It was definitely interesting . - Mm-hmm . So far , the military hasn 't claimed any testing in the area from nearby Luke Air Force Base , which leaves many residents wondering " What were those mysterious lights ? " It seemed like the Air Force didn 't know what it was , and if that 's true , then what was it , you know ? I don 't know . And now I 'll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party . Don 't get him too close to me , please . This just goes to show that you guys are entirely too serious . No one really took it that seriously from what I remember . Except Josh . Would you say he was sort of single-minded about stuff , like , once he got an idea ? Yeah . Yeah , there was no stopping him . Peeeeeew . Peeeew . Excuse me , sir , do you have a second to talk about the ... - Nope . - Phoenix Lights ? Okay , thank you . - It was just a " V " like this . - And you saw that yourself ? It was just a " V " like that , man . And we were like ... And we were like , " Hey , man , check that out , man . " I know ... UFOs will come at us ... and attack one day . - You think they 'll attack ? - And if that happ ... And if that happens , we will be prepared . So , did you see the lights ? No , not personally . Okay , so you saw them on , like , the news ? - Yeah . - Awesome . Channel 3 ? No . It doesn 't matter . Uh , do you think it was a UFO ? I don 't know . Maybe . - Okay , so , um ... - Can I ask you something now ? - Yeah . - Can I give you some advice ? - Umm , sure . Yeah . - This is an interview , right ? - Yeah . - So maybe you should ask me some open-ended questions . You know , like , things that don 't just warrant yes or no answers . Just , like , get me to talk ... Okay , yeah . No . Sure . Is this the same place ? She just had this charm about her that was electric . I think because of that she could get a lot out of people , people trusted her , saw her as a confidant . Jack was kind of pushing the lawyer thing , but truly I ... I think Ashley 's passion was journalism . Good morning , Canyon Park High School . I 'm Ashley Foster , CPTV . Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building . Welcome aboard . I know locker combinations can be tricky , but you 'll make it through just like I did . So just keep trying . Together , we 're a team ... and this is not teamwork . - That 's cute . - Yeah . What did you guys think of Josh ? We didn 't know him . - Is that Josh 's yearbook ? - Yeah , umm ... Ashley signed it . - Oh really ? - Yeah . - There it is . - Oh ! Look at that . I mean , he was never one of these kids that came over to the house . That 's it . Josh Bishop . - Seems like she had a lot of friends . - Oh , she did , yeah . She was a charmer . Have you ever ... Have you ever heard the story of Ezekiel 's wheel ? Umm ... - It-It 's from the Bible . - Oh . Yeah . Definitely not . Ezekiel describes God coming down from heaven in a chariot . It 's lighting up the sky , but all along the outside are eyes . Why would God need a spaceship ? Exactly , because he is space . Yeah . - All right , we 're done . It 's cool . - It 's done ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Great . Okay . Bye . Thanks for doing it . A very sweet girl . I met her a few times . I definitely know that Josh had a crush on her and ... I 'm hoping ... Now I 'm going to cry , I 'm hoping she liked him . Just because they ... spent so much time together , it would have been nice to know that he , in his short life , could experience that . - That 's Ashley 's handwriting . - Mm-hmm . And how much do you know about what Ashley and Josh were working on ? We certainly didn 't know any of that until ... - later . - Later . - It was after . - Yeah . Yeah . - We knew very little . - Mm-hmm . We 're going to meet with some astronomers . - Okay . - They 're going to have rocks and all different kinds of stuff to show us , so we 've got to be prepared , and we need to make sure that we 're on our " A " game . What does our " A " game mean ? We just have to be professional . But I 'm feeling ... I feel like I 've been pretty professional so far , thank you . I don 't think I 'm exactly amateur hour . I know , but I-I guess I 'm just a little nervous . I want everything to go good . Well , do you have any questions prepared ? I have a ton , they 're in my backpack . Do you have my backpack by the way ? Yeah , I do . Have you ever held a meteorite before ? I 'll start with this one . Whoa ! We get phone calls about UFOs kind of frequently . So when the Phoenix Lights happened , were people calling and asking ? Uh ... yeah , they were . - A few . - He shot the footage . - Oh , you shot the footage ? - That 's right , yeah . Oh , congratulations ! Can you learn to focus ? There you go . They 're in a formation of some kind , but they 're not really moving . Okay , that 's more likely flares . The flares are probably fifty to a hundred miles away . So you don 't see the smoke . You just see a bright light that just hangs there because of the parachute to hold them in place . Would you say you 're a hundred percent sure it 's not or you 're ninety-nine percent sure and still open to the possibility ? No , I 'm a hundred percent sure that-that-that ... that that 's what it was . - Oh ! A jet . - It 's an F-18 . - What was that ? - What did you say , Don ? - F-18 . - How do you know ? He 's got the ear for it . All right , I got as close as I could . There 's this creepy guy who was just staring me down . I think he was about to call security on me . You actually believe it was the Air Force . - You believe that ... - I do not . - You believe the bearded ... - I don 't know what I believe yet ! - I 'm open ... - The bearded Galileo Society of Phoenix , Arizona . I 'm disappointed . You 're no longer a producer . I am absolutely a producer ! I think I found the section . " Ancient UFO sightings . " Check this out . Petroglyphs . That 's totally a spaceship . Isn 't this that Bible thing you were talking about ? Ezekiel 's wheel . Wait , I know what this reminds me of . It 's like the machine at the end of Contact . I love that movie . Okay to go . Okay to go - - Initiate drop sequence . - Okay to go ! Oh , my God , Oh , my God . I think I 'm going through a Wormhole ! Okay - I don 't want to seem ungrateful for all the help , but what are we doing here ? We should be , like , breaking into Area-51 . Can you tell us your name and what you do here ? My name is Tony Duncan , I 'm from the Apache Nation . For the most part , we do a lot of story-telling . A lot of our stories of creation talk about how at one time we were up in the lights , up in the sky world , so maybe it was one of our peoples up there . So , you saw the lights last week ? I didn 't see them . I didn 't see them ... that exact time , um , but I just heard everyone 's different stories . But then eventually , you know , I seen all the footage of it . I first thought of the star people . " That must be them , our relatives . " You said you didn 't see them that exact time . - What did you mean ? - Yeah . Actually , um ... way before the lights that were seen in Phoenix , my friend that I grew up with ... His name is Pony ... We actually seen some lights in the same way , but they were a lot closer , and we followed them . - Wait . - You saw the same formation ? Yeah , yeah . They were in the sky , and they were actually ... They 'd be here and then they would take off really fast , and they would move around , and it was really exciting , and then it went way out into the field . Like , we were running way out into the field for a long time , our legs were getting all scratched up . Eventually , it just took off . Away , high upward . Just ... We couldn 't see it anymore . Uh , but we still talk about that , Pony and I. Uh , but that was off over in Salt River , in the Salt River Reservation . The bus definitely doesn 't go that far . That 's where we 're going . Well , that 's where we 're deciding if we should go , to be more accurate . Are you serious ? What , are you scared of sky people ? Of being taken to the spirit world - with the Anasazi . - Well , I kind Of believed him . Please come . I need my producer , you know . I think it would make a really sick documentary . I 'll show it to colleges or ... somebody . How do we get there ? That 's for me . Okay . Mark ! - Mrs. Bishop . - I haven 't seen you in so long . - I know , how are you ? - Good , how are you ? Hey . - You look great . - Thank you . - Did you do something with your hair ? - Oh . Just got it done . - Are you serious ? - Thanks for noticing . - No problem . - Can you stop flirting with my mom ? I 'm not flirting with your mom . She does look pretty good though . All right , go . And let 's not forget our most important piece of equipment on this journey ... my 1994 Grand Jeep Cherokee . Six-cylinder engine , blood-red finish , roof racks ... 16-inch clearance , perfect for maneuvering over any desert ... Sorry . Phenomenon has returned . - Oh , shit . - For the second time in one week , mysterious lights have been spotted over the Phoenix area ... - Yo , Mark ! Look at this ! - This time , over the suburb of Mesa . The sightings fascinated residents . It was completely silent . You couldn 't hear it , but you knew it was there . It was just massive , it was big . Eye-witnesses describe what they saw as being identical to the glowing orbs that passed through the area earlier this week ... Is that them ? Are those your aliens ? A mysterious " V " formation that flew from west to east . - The video you 're seeing right now ... - Dude , I know where this is . Captured in Mesa about ten miles from the ... Wait , this is it , here on the right . Right , right , right , right ! Go ! - Go , go , go , go , go ! - Shit . Let me know a little earlier next time Jeez , man . Dang . This is it . This is where they were , right over that ridge . Well ... whatever they were , they 're long gone now . Dude . Well , dude , check this out . Somebody 's up there . You do realize we gotta get up in , like , six hours , right ? Dude , we 're almost to the top . All right . Whoa ! Get down . Dude , kill the light . What are you doing ? Josh ? Josh , let 's get the hell out of here . Just hang on . Man , those are cops up there . Dude , there 's no plates . I don 't care , let 's go . They 're just cops . Dude , cops don 't walk around in the middle Of the night with telescopes . They 're looking for it . What ? - The UFO . - Josh , I don 't care . Let 's go . - That 's what they 're looking for . - Oh , my God . - Hey ! - Oh shit ! Run , bitch ! Run ! Come on ! Okay , so this is the first sighting right above South Mountain . This is the second . And this is where we 're going , right in the flight path of the first two . Nobody knows about this . I told you . I guess we 'll find out tomorrow . This was an unusual case . What do you mean it was unusual ? In what sense ? Uh , well ... it 's very uncommon to have three kids go missing at the same time . - Just because there were three of them ? - There were three , yeah . It is usually one , maybe two , boyfriend-girlfriend , but the fact that there were three , you know , set it outside of the norm . What did you guys use to get to drink ? I always got lemonade but Mark , he 'd always go for a suicide . All the way down . Dash of everything . Do you remember the night that you got the call ? Sure . Yeah . Um ... I was in my first year at ASU , and I got a call late at night from my mom saying that Mark hadn 't come home . My dad was convinced that I 'd taken him to some frat party and gotten him drunk . He was pissed off . He was even more pissed than Ashley 's dad , if you can believe that . My morn told me that if I just got them home ASAP , I wouldn 't get in trouble . They just ... they refused to believe me . I didn 't realize at the time that I was the last reasonable explanation that they had before they started to freak out for real . Officer ... Is someone there ? Possible 11-24 on the side of the highway . No , no one inside . - Copy that , 11-24 . - 10-4 . Should I put my phone in airplane mode ? It won 't affect the flight at all - if you don 't put it in . - All right . - I use that on planes . - Yeah , that 's bull crap . The reason I wanted to talk to you was because you were involved - in the search for my brother . - I was . Um , can you tell me a little bit about ... about that ? Strange case . That 's where the car was found . Right down there ? Do you think someone could have forced them off the road ? It 's possible , but I doubt it . It seems like they left the car here intentionally . What do you mean , " intentionally " ? Oh , the car was parked perfectly in line , so it didn 't seem like they were in a rush or anything . The doors were locked . We didn 't find the keys . It was functional . It ... it ran . It wasn 't like it ran out of gas or the battery died out there . They were able to start it up . And we found some beers in the car . Some beers ? Like , they were drinking ? Yeah . Just a couple of beers . We really don 't know if that means anything . There were traces of blood , and we think it was Mark 's . And your brother 's camera , of course . This is the one they found in the car . The Diamondbacks are the snakes that you want to look out for . Some dude died . I guess he was climbing over , like , a ridge and it struck , and it hit him in the neck . You dick ! What ? Are you serious ? What about her parents , huh ? You 're the one who wants to hit the road . You want to get in trouble before we even leave ? - God . - Now she comes out . Well . I guess it worked . It 's 7 : 30 in the morning , you dicks . All right , well , there 's a lot of dicks getting thrown at the driver right now . - What ? 'AH right , you guys ready ? - Josh , do you have all the equipment ? - Can you move your camera ? Yeah , no , we 're good , we 're good . Are you sure we shouldn 't double check ? 'Cause once we 're gone , we 're gone . - Okay , go , go . Please drive . - What ? - It 's just I don 't want to talk to my dad . - He looks like a sweet man . Yeah , until you meet him . Wait , when do you guys have to be home by ? My parents aren 't as concerned . My mom just like won 't go to sleep until I 'm home . Different when you 're a girl ... - No , no , a hundred percent . - With two men . - Hey look ! Look , Josh . - It would say Interstate . Look at this . It looks like those petroglyphs in that book . - Those were clearly made ... - Quick , shoot that .

Wouldn 't know if it was a couple of hours or maybe a whole day . That 's the hole we 're trying to fill . Another day in the desert , searching for clues for three missing teens . So the ground search was odd , 'cause it turned up almost nothing . Normally in a case like that where people turn up missing and then we find a vehicle , urn , they locate something . And there were no effective trails that led us one direction or another and even when they used their dogs out there . After two days of searching , a small army of law officers are setting up camp alongside a desert highway . People that are on the ground tell you that , " Hey , the one gal has a bright yellow shirt or something . " So that 's something that you 're gonna try to key on as looking down . And you just go back and forth , kind of like mowing the yard . It looks very flat from the air , but when you get down on the ground and you start walking around even the smallest bit of terrain , there is a lot of ... lot of places they could be . Now anyone with any information about this case is asked to call a special tip line ... If you 'd have asked me at the front end , " Are we going to find these kids , " I would have said , " Yeah . Oh , yeah , we 'll find them . " Three things to look for . Three shirts . I don 't want to be morbid , but three bodies . I mean , there 's-there 's more ... There 's more to search for . We just found nothing . So if you were to speculate , what do you think happened to them ? Maybe if I wasn 't on camera or something , I think maybe I could give you some opinions , but , um , it 's hard to speculate . Okay , so what do you think happened ? There 's potentially some sort of relationship issue . One boy likes the girl , and the girl likes the other boy , and the two boys find out about the issue . Maybe somebody came along and picked them up and could have taken them somewhere , but they should have surfaced . Foul play is possible , but it 's very tough if only one person did it . It 's very difficult to hold three people , you know , together . It could just be someone out there that 's running some dope . They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Wrong place wrong time . Stumble upon something that was five miles from where they were , where the vehicle was located , and they were driven to that loca ... Like I said , we didn 't find anything , so who knows what happened ? Hard to speculate . How did you meet Josh ? I feel weird talking about this , 'cause I know he 's gonna watch it later . We met , uh ... We met in church actually . - Really ? - Yeah . Everybody called Josh , " Ginger , " and they were making fun Of him , like , calling him " Ginger " because of his red hair , but when I was little , I didn 't know " Ginger " was a name for redheads . I just thought it was a nickname , like , specifically for Josh . So I just thought the coolest kid at Sunday school ... everybody knew who he was , so I went out of my way to hang out with him . That 's when we started becoming friends . Oh , nice . I just got some B-roll , but I got some really cool cactuses ... Were you guys filming me while I was asleep ? - No . - No . Never . Okay , a little bit . - Can you put your seatbelt back on ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - Literally nothing out here . Hello ! You 're gonna get your head taken off by one of those . - I wanna live here . - You wanna live here ? Yeah . Maybe . Whoa , whoa , watch out ! - God ! - Sorry , guys . My bad . - Whoa , check that out . - What ? What is it ? Dead animal . A coyote ? - Is it two ? - Yeah . - Yeah , it is . - Hold on , this camera sucks . - So that 's it ? - That 's it . That 's the last he shot . Hang on . So Josh went all the way out there and then just didn 't shoot anything past the road ? Doesn 't that seem weird to you ? I always thought it was a little odd . Why ? Why odd ? Well , your brother ... He seemed to have that camera glued to his face all the time . It-It just didn 't make any sense to leave it behind . So do you think maybe they had a second camera ? Like , is that a possibility ? I thought about that . I-I still think your brother would have had that with him . I know Ashley had access to those camera equipment and could check out , but I don 't remember anything being unaccounted for at the time . We ... we ran that thread out as far as we could , and we just couldn 't take it , and law enforcement couldn 't take it anywhere either . So that 's what the kids would have been using back in ' 97 , right ? It 's a little before my time , but yeah , probably . Do you still have any of those old cameras laying around ? Yeah . I 'm Ashley Foster , CPTV . Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building . Where did you get this ? This was found in Mark Abrams ' Jeep after he went missing with Ashley and with my brother . We think Josh had a second camera with him on the trip . If he did have one , it most likely came from the school , so I was wondering if you thought Ashley could have checked one out from here , like , maybe she used a different name ? It 's possible , but like I said , it was before I started . Would there have been , like , a logbook or records of that ? - Like , stuff that might have been ... - It 's been 20 years . I 'm so sorry I can 't be of more help to you . Even if they had a second camera , it just ... it went missing with them . Just another dead end , you know ? And new developments tonight . Rescuers were forced to call off their search for three missing teens , saying there was " no new credible evidence or clues to guide the search . " It 's like they 've been written off . They 've been ... my son and his friends have been abandoned by the police department . All the efforts by law enforcement to develop some evidence as to what happened , they were pretty ... Well , they were negative . They could never go anywhere with the case . I think if they had kids , they 'd want somebody looking for their kid . Dear Ashley , I know that you 're alive ... and that you can hear my voice right now . You can 't imagine how much your father and I miss you ... and love you . Every night , I have a dream that I come downstairs and you 're sitting at the table like you were never even gone . I know this means something . I know it means that you ... are still alive . Your father and I will never give up hope . I love you , Ashley . Please come home . I wanted a funeral ... but Jack wouldn 't have it . So , here we are . The bench was a compromise ? Yep . That 's what marriage is about . It 's ... uh ... Sophie , I don 't ... I don 't think your brother 's alive . I-I ... I don 't think ... I don 't think he is . I think something would have developed . Jay , get in here . - What 's up ? - Have you seen this ? If you 'd been here ten years ago and standing out here and looking up there at the lights and the view , um , you would have been astounded . You would have been amazed . - Is that the governor ? - Yeah . Twenty years ago , he said the lights were a joke . He had a whole press conference making fun of them . And now he 's saying he saw the lights that night . I got four of ' em . He 's basically admitting he lied . The former governor , a Vietnam Air Force veteran , had never publicly acknowledged seeing it until now And I suspect that ... unless the Defense Department proves this otherwise , that it was probably some form of an alien spacecraft . And I think as a public figure , you have to be very careful about what you say , because people can have pretty emotional reactions . Is that him ? Okay , follow me and just keep rolling . Excuse me , Mr. Garland ? Hi , I 'm Sophie Bishop . We spoke on the phone . I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . Right , I just have a couple questions . You worked for the governor from 1992 until he resigned in ' 97 , is that right ? Sophie , I don 't know anything about your brother . Okay , what about the Phoenix Lights ? On March 15th , 1997 , you went on TV , and you said that they were military flares . Did you see the Governor on CNN saying that was a lie ? You were his press secretary at the time . Listen , I really am very sorry about your brother . We were just trying not to create a panic . Who told you to lie ? I mean , what if Josh was on to something ? We always assumed he got lost or kidnapped or ... murdered but what if ... What if he got abducted by aliens ? Jesus , I sound like him , don 't I ? So ... now what ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we 're doing here anymore . Can 't believe you 're leaving . It feels like you just got here . Can I ask you one more question ? Why did you and Dad decide to call it quits ? Sweetheart , everyone 's divorced now . I want to know . Was it Josh 's disappearance or would you guys have split up anyway ? Hello ! You 're going to get your head taken off by one of those . I want to live here . - You want to live here ? - Yeah . Maybe . Josh , you want to stop here ? - Well , how is she ? - She 's good . Just getting ready for the big move , you know . Well , please tell her , you know , if she needs any help or anything , she should call me . Somebody knows what happened . Mark didn 't just wander off into the desert . He didn 't get lost . That never made sense to me . If Josh hadn 't gone missing ... do you think you and Mom would still be together ? Yeah . What 'd she say ? Sweetheart , what happened was your brother went missing . Completely missing . And it took over our lives . Resources to make sure these teenagers are found . If that 's true , then what was it , you know ? I don 't know . Is Josh dead ? Is he alive ? Was he suffering ? Our relationship became about all those questions , and your father , he couldn 't do it anymore and still be the man that I fell in love with , and I couldn 't do it anymore and still be his wife . Everybody keeps criticizing me for , you know , not dealing with it . I was the only one who was still out there trying to figure out what happened to your brother . Do you think there 's ever going to be a point where you can let it go , Dad ? I mean , show ... show me his body . - Good to see you . - Love you . - I love you , too . - Okay . When you get home , give me a call , okay ? - Okay . - Let me know you got in okay . - Yeah . - Okay . - We 're going to see you Christmas ? - Yeah , I 'll see you Christmas . - Okay . - Okay . - All right . - Love you . I love you . - Bye , Dad . - Bye . Hi , Sophie , this is Luisa . Luisa Moreno . We spoke several months ago at Canyon Park High . Um ... just call me back when you can . Hi . - Thank you so much for meeting me . - Yeah . Did you have a hard time finding the place ? - No , no , not at all . - Great . This place has been on the books since the late ' 70s . Pretty much anything old or outdated gets thrown in here . I was throwing away some garbage over the weekend and just saw it sitting in the drawer . Somebody must have thrown it in here and forgotten about it . - Can I take this ? - Oh , it 's yours . I know you 're excited about this , but ... I just don 't want you to get your hopes up , you know ? Yeah , I know . Is that a tape ? - Be careful . - I know . Okay - - That 's Ashley 's handwriting . - Really ? Holy shit . Hit play . I 'm going to let you do this . All right , you ready ? Ready . Soph ? Sophie ? Hi . Sophie Bishop . I have an appointment with Captain Groves . IDs please . Just pull over to the side , ma 'am . I need you to wait right over there . Okay . Is there a problem ? We should have an appointment . Yes ma 'am . I need you to wait right over there . Okay - What 's it been , like an hour ? That 's him . Okay , uh , just stay here , keep it low . - Miss Bishop ? - Hi . Hi there . So we can do the interview out here or in your office , whichever you prefer . It 's not gonna happen . Okay , but ... when we spoke on the phone , you said that it was fine , so I guess I 'm just wondering what happened that made you change your mind . I understand . Did you watch the footage ? Drive safe . You okay ? Yeah , I just honestly wasn 't expecting that . What did he say ? He said , " Don 't let that footage get out . " What do you want to do ? What do you think Josh would do ? This is gonna be rad . Dude . - Yeah . - Look at its eye . - Yeah . - This camera is amazing . - Yo , don 't get too close . - It smells burnt . It 's like males competing for females . They have the same burns . Countless stories when UFOs have been sighted about , like , animal experimentation . Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah . They just got cooked by the sun . - Woo ! - Oh shit . This way . - Obviously I 'm joking . - You just said you look like older Leo . People told me that when Romeo and Juliet came out . What , they said that you ... That literally made me more popular in school . What are you guys talking about ? - What ? - What are you guys talking about ? You . Just at the top of that ridge . We wouldn 't be able to see anything from down here . Not like we 're gonna see anything up there , either . Don 't be that guy . We don 't need that guy . You remember where we parked the car , right ? Uh ... yeah . It 's ... that a-way . - Ooh , Josh . - Oh shit . Come look at this . - What do you got ? - Whoa . Petroglyphs . Oh ! Guess this means we 're on the right track . Wow . Ancient graffiti . Now what you see below me are Native American petroglyphs . They were probably put here hundreds of years ago by the Apache . They were native to these lands , very adept at living in these mountainous regions . Uh ... the spiral shape that you see below us ... Historians aren 't quite sure what it could have represented . It could have represented ripples in water , things that they saw in the sky . And ... that 's pretty much it . Petroglyphs . Please be careful . - You get that ? - Yeah . - It look steep ? - Yeah . You guys are idiots . Ah , I should not have smoked that cigarette . Whoa . How far do you want us to go , Josh ? Just keep going . I 'm wheezing . I 'm out of breath . Whoa . - You rolling ? - Yeah . Check this out . Oh , shit . Where 'd you get those ? Ask Diane Sawyer over there . I got it from a guy at the gas station . Here . He had a crush on you or something . I just used my eyes . - Yeah . Dude , no , no . Do not film this . - We have two more in here . Is Josh filming this ? Whoa . Will you please be as careful as possible with that on a cliff edge . Sorry . - Where 's Mark ? - He 's taking a leak . Oh , you didn 't want to go with him ? Shut up . - What are you doing ? - It 's my turn to interview you . - This is ... - See how you like it . It 's not a Hitchcock movie , you know . The director isn 't in this one . You guys playing Truth or Dare up here ? - Want to play Truth or Dare ? - Yeah . - You go first . - You actually want to play ? - Yeah , why not ? - Come on . - I 've got a couple beers in me . - Uh ... dare . Okay . I dare you to tell the truth . That is not how you play the game . - It 's fair enough . - That is how I play the game . What 's. uh ... what 's the deal with you and Debbie Gomez ? De-Debbie Gomez ? Why ? Well , the old rumor mill 's been , you know ... We hang out sometimes . Like , I don 't ... You guys play tennis or go golfing ? Why are you being a dick , dude ? Like , we hang out . - Like , it 's not ... - Why didn 't you invite her here ? I don 't know . I didn 't want to make it weird . What do you mean , " make it weird " ? Why would that be weird ? I didn 't want to make it like a double date . - Wait , now that 's weird . - Oh , come on , man . All right , we cannot stay here forever . We need to go as soon as the sun dips down . Just hold on and enjoy it for a second , please . I just want to get this . It 's gorgeous . - Josh . - What ? - What is that ? - What ? - What ? - That . No , no , what is that ? - Ashley . - Whoa , what ' ? - Wait , Mark , isn 't that ... what ? - It 's just kind of sitting there . Wait , isn 't the Luke Air Force Base over there ? - Yeah . - Maybe . Probably just something from the Air Force Base . - Maybe a helicopter . - You 're the one looking for UFOs . - No , that 's not a helicopter . - I 'm just pointing it out . We 'd hear it if it was a helicopter . Hold on . - Wait . Okay , you guys . - Think it 's a fighter jet ? - No , that 's not a fighter jet . - Don 't get ahead of yourself . It 's just a light . It 's not . You 'd hear it , you 'd hear it . What ? Oh , my God . Okay . Okay . Whoa ! - Holy shit ! - What ! Josh , did you get that ? Hold on . Oh ... - What was that ? - I don 't ... - Wait , tell me you got that on camera . - Yes ! Can you play that back ? - Oh , my God ! Josh . - Guys , stop , stop , stop . Wait , Josh , seriously though . This is the greatest day of my life . Oh , my ... did you know that was gonna happen ? Here , give me that back . Did you know that was gonna happen ? Is Luke Air Force Base that way ? Luke Air Force Base is that way , but that 's not Air Force . - How do you know ? - You don 't know that . Because it 's not 2150 . Come back . - All right , man . - Twenty minutes . Get like a last pan or whatever . Let 's go . Dude , come on . I 'm happy for you , let 's go . - Just ten more minutes ? - You 've done that twice . Do you know how hard it 's gonna be to walk through this canyon in the dark ? I don 't see what the problem is , okay ? - You know the way back . - It 's already dark . The problem is that it starts to get really dark and really cold , and she has a curfew , and I still have to drive . - Please . - Come on . Cut . We gotta go . All right , we 're leaving . What if we get arrested by , like , the Air Force or something ? That would actually be the scariest situation . Like our parents don 't ever find out , like , what 's going to happen to us . The Air Force just takes us away or something . That 'd be so sad . My mom would think I was just in my room playing with the camera . They wouldn 't notice ? They wouldn 't ... like , it would take a couple years I think . My parents are noticing right now . Oh ... You good ? - Yeah . - Mark . - Mark ! - Sorry . - Whoa . - Give it to me . Give me that . Give me the UFO . - Ah ! After tonight , you can be producer , assistant director . You know what ? If you 're lucky , we can talk " co . " - We can what ? - We can talk " co . " - All right . - Co-director . He 's three years older than me . His brother voted for Dole . - No , he didn 't . - Bob Dole ? Really ? Yes , he did . Your brother 's a moron . My brother 's ... are you kidding me ? He 's an ... he 's an engineering student . He 's an engineering student . He 's actually very smart . He 's gonna be president one day . - Is this a dead end ? - No , you gotta keep going through . Are you sure it 's not a dead end ? - I 'm positive it 's not a dead end . - All right . We walked through here in the daytime . - Does it usually get this tight ? - Yeah . We 're good . It goes on for a while . I 'm gonna be in so much trouble . - You guys need help ? - It 's worth being in trouble . Do you understand what we 've seen today ? Yeah , but I can push it like an hour , but any longer , it 's ... We would 've noticed these on the way in for sure . I don 't remember these . Yeah . I for sure would have noticed these . Mark , are you sure we passed ... Mark where are we going ? Hold on , I 'll be super sure , hold on . Are you sure we 're going the right way ? Yes ! Why can 't you just use the stars , man ? - Josh . - No , it 's this way . - Are you positive ? - Yep . All right . - Do you guys not hear that ? - What ? - What ? - Josh , come on . - Everything just looks like rocks . - I know where we are . Yeah , but you keep going left then right , then left then right . You keep complaining about us being late , so can we go ? I know exactly where we 're going . I mean , who else are we gonna listen to anyway ? Okay , let 's go . What way ? Hold on . Just stop moving . Let me ... look first . Well ... - I definitely heard that . - I just heard something . Guys . Get down . Get down . Mark , get down . - What is that ? - It could be a train . I-I ... I didn 't see any tracks out here . Shh . Just listen . Okay , we 're almost back . - Let 's get the hell out of here . - Let 's go . - Everybody walk faster . - Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . It 's okay . - Ash , it 's all right . - We need to get out of here now . I know . Just calm down . Josh ... do you recognize any of this ? - Give me the compass . - Do you want to try ' ? - Guys ! - Yes ! Give me the compass . Get us home . - Okay , I will . I will ! - You do it . Okay , so ... we came from this way . We got this way . - It 's definitely not this way . - Mark ? - Mark , where you going ? - Just stay there . - Mark , where you going ? - I 'm gonna find the car from up here ! You 're not gonna see anything up there , it 's pitch black . Hey , Josh ? Can you come look at this ? What ? It 's just not working . - Why would it do that ? - I don 't know . Whoa ! What is that ? Oh , my God . What is that ? - Josh , I don 't like this . - Hold on , wait . Just stay still . Where is it coming from ? I don 't know . - Oh ! - Ashley . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Josh . Ashley , run ! Run ! Oh , my God ! - Get down ! Get down ! - Ow ! Run ! Jesus Christ ! Whoa . Holy shit . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Josh ? Josh ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah , you ? Yeah .

It 's close . You saw the car ? - What are you talking about ? - Come on . - Mark , where are you going ? - I don 't know . Can we just get the hell out of here , please ? - No , wait ! - Mark ! - Mark ! - Let 's go ! Okay , Mark , slow down ! - Tell me you saw that , man . - Hey . Can we just get the hell out of here , please ? I think we should have a group huddle first . Mark , what was that ? Come on , man , what did you see ? Josh , I need you to stop talking until we find the car . Okay . You 're sure the car 's over here ? Yes , I 'm positive the car 's over here . Can we please talk about what we got on tape ? Oh yes ! - I told you . - The car ! Oh , Oh ! Thank God . We 're not gonna see anything , Josh . Josh , get your ass in the car . Ah , come on , what if they come back ? I swear to God I 'll leave you . Let 's go . - Just five minutes , man . - Come on . Get in the car . You really didn 't see anything ? I thought I did . I thought I saw these , um ... - Like circles ? - No , dumbass . Like rings . And they were above me , and then they were gone . Wait , rings like the petroglyphs ? Did you guys not see these ? All right , it was obviously in my head , all right ? Let 's just go . Oh shit . Oh shit . There we go . Oh , thank God . You guys , what the hell just happened to us ? No one has ever filmed anything like that before . Let 's just get out of here . Signs of civilization . I know . It feels so nice to listen to music . You 're gonna be real famous , Josh . - I think he will be . - Thank you . Yeah , until they think it 's all faked . - Are you okay , Mark ? - Yeah . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Your head feels a little bit hot . Yeah , I have a stomachache , but I 'm good . I think Mark 's gonna be the most famous when people see how bad he pissed his pants . Dude , shut up . Are you serious ? - Mark , you were really scared . - I would have loved to see - either of you up there by yourselves . - You should have seen your face . Okay - What 's up with the radio ? - I have to drive for two hours . - All right , all right , all right . And we 're done shooting . Whoa , whoa , what is that ? - What ? - Is that a car ? - What is that ? - What the hell is that ? It 's just a car . No , no , no , there 's no way on earth . Josh , cars don 't have one light . What is that ? Is it getting clo ... turn that off . Sorry . - Okay , Mark , speed up . Go , go , go , go , go . - I am . Josh , is it getting closer ? Yeah , it 's getting closer , I can see it . - Oh , my God . - What the hell is that ? Josh , it 's not a car ! Josh , it 's not a car ! Josh , what 's it doing ? What 's it doing ? - Is it getting closer ? - Oh , my God , it 's right behind us ! Mark , speed up ! Go , go , go , go , go !

 Their astronaut is going to die . Of course there are other ways the Taiyang Shen booster . Our engineers have run the numbers , and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit . Why hasn 't NASA approached us ? They don 't know . Our booster technology is classified . So if we do nothing ... The world would never know we could have helped . Then , for the sake of argument , let 's say we decide to help them ... We 'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen . We need to keep this among scientists , a co-operation between space agencies .

 Previously on " marvel 's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Daisy : It seems Radcliffe is keeping our team alive in this framework . So we have to hook up with our people and find out where on earth their bodies are being held . And rescue them . Lincoln . Ward . Don 't forget this . You were the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. And now you 're trapped in a virtual prison , and I am here to wake you up . Put that away before we both get arrested . Yes , I 'd like to report a subversive . A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID . Really ? I want any and all assets in the area on this . Hydra is after you . We have to get somewhere safe . Ladies . Is she your source in the resistance ? Ward , I have nothing to do with the resistance ! Well , I do . Fitz : Good evening , madame . Leopold . These ... Subversives ... Apparently , they 've got a mole inside hydra . Coulson ... Remember me . You 're the closest thing i have to family . Daisy ? So , we 're both from the " real world , " we 're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents , our bodies are being held captive , and this is all a virtual prison , built to keep us sedated . Am I missing anything ? No , that 's about the gist of it . I knew I wasn 't crazy . Hydra lies about everything . The news ? It 's all fake . Take the Cambridge incident . It was a setup . That girl shouldn 't have been at that school in the first place . Where we 're from , she died . This never happened . Hey , Mr. coulson , my homework was done , I swear , but then my dad made me - - Amy , we 've been over this . Until first bell , this is my time . Right . Okay . Geez . Sorry . It 's okay . Hydra used Cambridge to take control , in the name of law and order - - to justify everything . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . I knew if anyone would understand , it 'd be you . I would 've figured it out a long time ago if it wasn 't for the mind-control soap . Yeah . Wait . What ? That blue soap everyone uses ? Hydra loads it up with chemicals . It seeps into our bloodstream . Implants false memories into our brains . They want us to believe this is a magical place . But don 't worry , I 'm clear . I make my own soap now . No , I think that you 're talking about project Tahiti . They messed with your head a little bit which is why you probably remember some things , uh ... Why don 't we put the soap theories on hold just for one second , okay ? Yeah ? We got a problem . Oh , you have no idea . Something big 's going down over here . They 're sending a unit to pick up your teacher friend . You 're gonna need a substitute . come on . Don 't quit on me . Not now . Not now . How did you beat me ? Girl : The human brain peaks as early as age 24 . Face it - - you 're slowing down , dad . Oh , is that right ? Well , tell me , show-off , what 'd you use for an electronic speed control ? Well , I sort of found something by school , in the park . A hydra drone ? Maybe I borrowed a part or two . Hope , you know better . We don 't mess around with those guys . It was all crashed and messed up . I made sure no one was looking - - no , no , we stay off hydra 's radar , we keep our heads down , and follow their rules , always . Always ! I know . I 'm really , really sorry , daddy . It 's okay . It 's okay . Just want you to be more careful , all right ? I tell you what . I 'll take the drone parts back later , and then you and I can try to get mine working together . But you got to promise to go easy on your old man . No promises . No promises ? No ? No ? Get out of here . Go on . Go get your bag . We 'll be late for the bus . All right , sparkplug ... 10 o 'clock . Easy - - Harley-Davidson . Engine ? Twin cam , 88 . Ooh ! That 's my girl . Keep your head down . Do what they say . I 'm right here with you . Move it , move it ! Line up ! Ids out ! You know the drill . Let 's get them out - - now ! got to be contraband . They busted my neighbor for a laptop last night . The drone - - it 's in my bag . What ? I was gonna take it back myself so you wouldn 't get in trouble . I 'll handle this . man : Get him ! he 's on the list - - potential inhuman . Take him away . It 's okay . It 's okay . hi . Oh , hi . It 's me again - - Phil coulson . I called hydra on you . My bad . Water under the proverbial bridge . I 'm so glad to see you , sir . Apparently , in the real world , I have a robot hand . Pretty cool , right ? And here , he makes his own soap . How about that . Coulson : I do . You should , too . Daisy : Okay . We need to move . Hydra came back for coulson . Ward warned us away , but we barely made it out . Oh , thank goodness for Grant ward . I don 't love it , either , but this is the second time he 's helped us . And so I hate to say this , but I think we can trust him . Until we can 't . Betraying those closest to him is his signature move . For now , we just need to get somewhere safe . Ward set up a time and place for us to meet the resistance . It 's a whole password-exchange thing . Bona fides ? I always wanted to do that . Or , I 've been thinking ... What if i reached out to Fitz ? Simmons , we 've b- - we 've been over this . If you were able to get through to coulson , then surely I could get Fitz to remember me . Fitz is not the same . He 's different here . This reality may be upside down , but Fitz is still Fitz . He 's still a good person . Who happens to be second in command at hydra . Yeah , which means he has resources , not to mention framework expertise , which we 'll need to get out of Radcliffe 's hydra snow globe . Holden Radcliffe , the scientist ? I ... I-i saw something a while back , and I cut it out . I ... Here it is . " Famed hydra scientist working on inhuman cure . " Something felt off about him . Do you know him ? Do we know him ? Why would Radcliffe be in here ? I don 't know . But think about it . He built the framework , which means ... He can help us get out . Coulson : Yeah , one catch . Nobody 's seen him since this photo was taken . You guys meet up with ward 's contact . I 'll go back to the triskelion and get a location on Radcliffe . Daisy , it 's too dangerous . I 'll be fine . I 'll be in and out . No one will even know I 'm there . Man : It 's only a matter of time before we find her . We 've detained several inhuman sympath- - dismissed , agent . All this for one subversive ? Why won 't you let me help you ? I need you focused on your work right now . Project looking glass is ahead of schedule . Tell me what 's really going on . It 's fine . I 'm handling it . Ophelia , i know that look . You 're worried . Who is she ? no one . She doesn 't matter . she 's plotting against me . I need to find her and expose anyone who 's helping her . I 'll send my team . Consider the threat eliminated . You 'd really do anything for me , wouldn 't you ? I 'd cross the universe for you . what the hell are you doing ? I got a lead on someone who could take down this whole place . It 's not safe here . All right ? I think they 're on to me . Listen , this will go a lot faster if you would quit mouth-breathing on me . Madame hydra 's restricted files ? You have lost your mind . The soap made me do it . Let 's go . May : Hold it ! Skye , you need to come with us . I 'll take may , you take the others . When we get to the door - - get this to Simmons . She 'll know what to do . Skye - - I 'll be fine . Go . According to ward 's intel , the drone should leave in five seconds . Coulson : This ward guy - - where we 're from , he 's a friend of ours ? Uh ... He was . Didn 't end well . I take it you 're our contact ? For the season , it 's been unusually rainy . rain or shine , the man with the umbrella is always ready . what ? Did I say it wrong ? Hands out front . Wrists together . honestly , is this really necessary ? Oh , cool ! I 'm Jeffrey mace . Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. Sorry about the hoods , but trust is a luxury these days . That being said , ward vouched for you , so I 'm happy to provide you sanctuary . Thank you , sir . My name is Jemma Simmons , and this is - - Phil coulson . Wow . I can 't believe it 's really you . The patriot ! The inhuman leader of the resistance . He 's kind of a big deal ! Uh , Jeffrey 's fine . The patriot 's a little much for my taste . Man , I dreamed about what your suit would look like . I made a few sketches , but this is actually way cooler . This place - - what happened here ? For about 70 years after world war ii , nothing . No one even knew it was here . But then , a couple years back , a brave agent named Billy koenig gave his life getting me the location . It 's taken all that time just to get it operational again . Got to say , the whole rebel alliance aesthetic 's really working for me . I 'll take that as a compliment . I think ? This way , please . The early days were tough . A lot of good agents died for this . Agent Burrows . Sir , it 's bad out there . And , uh ... We lost agent cook . I 'm sorry . We honor him by continuing the fight . Who are these people ? Potentials . Some of them have the inhuman gene or they had a relative who did . Hydra 's hunting them . It 's all we can do to find them first , give them shelter , and relocate them somewhere safe . Well , look what the cat dragged in . Ward : Been too long , sir . What 's happened ? They got Skye . is this gonna take long ? We have a mission . Madame hydra 's office requested you specifically . Why me ? The target was spotted via drone yesterday . She 's been reaching out to leaders of the resistance and is planning a major attack . Capture any subversives found on site , but do not underestimate this woman . Lethal force is authorized , if necessary . Did you know about this ? And believe me , we will defeat these terrorists , and we will make our society great again . Hail hydra . Hail hydra . Hail hydra . Hail hydra . hope : He was inhuman , that man they arrested ? Does that mean he 's bad ? I don 't know , sparkplug . Do we hate inhumans ? No . They 're people , just like you and me . But if they didn 't do anything wrong , why are they all being arrested ? Look , you 're smarter than most kids your age , and you pick up on things pretty quickly . But I don 't want you worrying about this stuff , okay ? What would 've happened if they 'd looked in my bag ? Then I would 've taken care of it , ' cause that 's my job . Tell you what - - how about if we ... Make some popcorn and watch a video ? " Chopping mall " ? Again with that silly robot movie ? Don 't pretend you don 't love it . Okay , okay . But I 'm still fast-forwarding through the bad parts . I don 't know . It all happened so fast . From everything you 've told me , Skye 's tough as hell . She can handle herself in there . Before they took her , did she get a location on Radcliffe ? you know , Skye hasn 't been herself ever since you showed up . what is it that you 're really after ? You , of all people , the hydra double agent , are doubting my loyalty . That is rich . Mace : But don 't forget - - you 're only here because I trust him , not you . Fine . You want to question me ? When hydra wiped out the academy and people were dying , I was there . I fought and took a bullet . I had to claw my way out of a mass grave . How 's that for loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? I apologize . ogygia ? These coordinates - - they 're east of Bermuda . There shouldn 't be anything out there . Who is this Radcliffe ? He 's a scientist . Skye said he could take down hydra . what does that mean ? I can 't be sure , but we need to find him as quickly as possible . I 'm sorry . With all that 's going on , i can 't send a team today . Then send us . With all due respect , this is a spy organization ... And you 're a teacher . Seems you need all the help you can get . Skye did risk everything for this . They may have a point , sir . I can pilot and supervise . all this because of one subversive ? Seems a little extreme . May : Be quiet . Do your job . No ! No ! No ! Daddy ! Leave him alone ! Daddy ! Let her go ! Daddy , help me ! Daddy , help me ! Daddy ! Daddy ! She 's just a kid ! Let her go ! No ! The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it . We 've had to steal what vehicles we could . Someday , this could really be special . Imagine a fleet of quinjets launching from here . Imagine that . Ward : Sir . Good luck out there . Simmons : Thank you . Why didn 't you tell them this reality 's fake ? Keep your voice down . You lied to them . It wasn 't a lie . It was an omission . Not everyone is ready for that truth . Oh , but I am ? Yes . So far , you 're the only one who remembers the way things should be . It 's only fragments . Fragments have got you this far . We liberated this guy last year . This is a quinjet ? Yeah . And that fleet mace described ? You commanded it . Except yours were loads nicer , and you wouldn 't believe Zephyr one . Mack : This has to be a mistake . We didn 't do anything . We - - we shouldn 't be here . You 're in a lot of trouble . But we 're innocent . We keep our heads down , we obey the rules - - people who haven 't done anything don 't end up here . We don 't want to cause any trouble . And hope - - she 's just a kid . That doesn 't mean she 's innocent . Please ... I 'll do anything . So , this Radcliffe - - is he dangerous ? Maybe not physically . But sometimes the greatest threats are the ones right in front of you . I 'm sorry . Excuse me ? I should 've never left Skye . Oh . I 'm sure she 'll be okay . Which I keep telling myself , but if anything happens ... I 'd never forgive myself . I 'd die for her . Why don 't i give you a minute ? Everything all right ? It 's been years since I 've even been on a plane . It 's perfectly normal to be nervous . For the longest time , i just wanted someone to believe me and tell me I wasn 't crazy . You are not crazy . I live alone and make my own soap . I - - uh ... It 's quaint . Hipster , even . That 's not how my ex-wife saw it . Who am I kidding ? I 'm not remotely qualified to be here . I know the real coulson , and I believe in you , even if you don 't just now . you 're exactly where you 're meant to be . Ward : 30 minutes out . Torrent downloaded from RARBG Leopold ? what 's wrong ? turns out your new subversive was executed at the academy . But I suppose you knew that already , didn 't you ? I can explain . So , she 's an inhuman , then ? what else have you been keeping from me ? This woman is not from here . She crossed over - - from the other side . I thought that was impossible . As did I. So this is why you 've been so keen on finishing project looking glass . The people from that world want to destroy what we 've built . I was only trying to protect you . You never talk about your time there . Why ? Tell me the truth . You owe me that much . Over there , the worst thing happened . S.H.I.E.L.D. won the war . Hydra lost . I was their slave . Treated as less than human . When I escaped , I hoped they couldn 't follow me , but ... Here they are . if I can 't return there and defeat my enemies , we 'll never be safe . everything I do is so that you and I ... Can be together . we 'll finish this later . Come . I 'm Skye . What 's your name ? Hope MacKenzie . Hope ... You 're the hope that he lost . He didn 't lose me . I was taken by you people . My dad follows the rules . He 's a good person . I 'm sure he is . Then let us go home . I wish it was that simple . It 's not my call . Dad warned me not to mess around with that drone , but I didn 't listen . This is all my fault . I - - hey , hey , it 's okay . Your dad 's gonna be all right . I promise . Please help my dad . Don 't let anything happen to him - - please . get anything from the girl ? She 's scared . What about her dad ? I haven 't broken him ... Yet . I was just with hope . She 's safe . That 's one special girl . Thank you . Listen , we need to talk . do you know who I am ? You 're Daisy Johnson . we 're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . Yes . Yes . Oh , thank god . Okay . We need to get you out of here , reconnect with coulson and Simmons . Definitely . Yo-yo is with us on the outside . She 's safe . You have no idea how worried she is about you . You don 't ... Know who she is . Uh ... And me ? Do you know me ? I 'm sorry . That 's what the other agent told me to say . Lock down the elevators . Find her ! Simple extraction . We grab him and go . Keep your eyes open . I 'll do the talking . What about me ? What should I do ? Just ... Try to not to get yourself killed . Consider it a precaution . A " break glass in case of emergency . " drop it . Hive ? No . It can 't be . Hello , again , traitor . surprise . You shouldn 't be here . None of you . Unh-unh . That 's close enough , pal . Oh , but ... No , you 're not hive at all . You 're the one who came before . I never did meet him . This is not a social visit . Oh , Jemma , if only you knew the trials and tribulations I 've endured . I am fresh out of sympathy for liars who kidnap my friends and replace them with killer androids . Don 't forget about implanting bogus memories and letting me think I 'm off my gourd . Not cool , bro . Catch up later . We need to move . It 's all become so very complicated . I never meant to hurt anyone . Right now , I don 't give a damn about what you meant . You 're going to help us find our friends and escape . My dear , I 'm afraid there is no escape from this place . Man : Level 7 clear . Going down ? there 's no way out . It 's over . Radcliffe : This isn 't the world I 'd intended . Things have gone dreadfully wrong . Maybe not so much for you . I promise you , this is a gilded cage . One can only drink so many mai tais , watch so many sunsets - - oh , stuff it . You 're in early retirement while the rest of your world tears itself apart . I assure you , my intentions were pure . The framework was to be a paradise , a-a pleasant forever-after . All right , story time is over . You 're coming with us . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . That wasn 't a request . who is that ? No one . It 's unimportant . You guys watch him . I 'll go and get her . No , you can 't drag her into this ! It 'll only confuse her . She doesn 't remember the other world . It 's Agnes . Agnes was dying . In order to save her , I had to bring her consciousness into the framework . And her body ? Deceased , I 'm afraid . We gave her a burial at sea . It was very emotional . The framework is all Agnes has left . Okay , what the hell is he talking about ? To be honest , he lost me there , too . As a matter of fact , she 's not the only one in that particular boat . Aida ... Sort of killed me , as well . What ? ! How did she go against her programming ? She found a loophole . I mean , it was really rather clever . If I weren 't dead already , I 'd be impressed . Ward : We 're getting that woman , and we 're going . We can sort this out at h.Q. I never wanted any of this to happen . I only wanted to do good . Then actually do good . Tell me where aida is keeping our friends . The Russian has a base under a drilling platform in the baltic . Go and save them , and leave us in peace . How do we get out ? Did you build an exit back to the real world ? Of course I did , but I suspect aida 's discovered it by now . You 'll just have to go however you came in . That 's the problem . Ours isn 't working . Yeah , but that means ... Oh , dear god . Then she knows you 're here . Who ? ! Who ? ! Who is " she " ? Oh , my ... Go ! Hide ! Hide ! All of you ! search the island . Find them . You two , with me . look at that plane . What kind of monster flies around in something that size ? Radcliffe : We had a deal . You promised me if I stayed on the island , out of your way , you 'd leave us alone . Drop the indignation , doctor . This island 's no-fly zone was breached an hour ago . We both know you 're harboring subversives . And I 'll find them soon enough . What is Fitz doing with aida ? I don 't know who aida is , but that 's madame hydra . Subversives ? They are people who happen to be our friends . I wanted to help them . You 've turned them into prisoners ! I did exactly as you asked . Don 't play innocent with me . We both know it 's gone much further than that . I took away their one greatest regret . How things played out from there wasn 't up to me . You put yourself into the framework . You 've been manipulating it ever since . The whole thing is an unmitigated disaster , and all you do is lie ! Sometimes it 's okay to lie to save a life . You taught me that . Don 't use my words or my bloody programming against me , aida ! Do not ... Call me that here . " Aida " is an acronym . The " a " stands for " artificial . " do you know how degrading it is ... To be kept in a closet , to be used ... To be treated as a thing ? Well , i am not your tool . Not anymore . Found one in the back . Holden , what 's happening ? Who are these people ? mack : Sparkplug . You okay ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm all right . Really . Skye ! What happened ? She was nice to me . hydra thanks you for your service . daddy ? hail hydra . well , it 's exactly as you said . The other side 's coming for us . She even has your face . wh- - why does she look like me , Holden ? Radcliffe : Don 't panic , love . I can explain all of this . I-i-i-I 've meaning to , really , but the timing just - - this man is from the other side . He 's the one who enslaved me . What ? ! Now , hold on . That 's a pretty extreme bit of paraphrasing , don 't you think - - he used me . Kept me as his property . Leopold , my dear boy , I don 't know what lies she 's been feeding you , but - - he wants what we have for himself . He means to replace me with her . No . That couldn 't be further from the truth . This is Agnes . She 's harmless . There 's no threat . You have to believe me . Aah ! then convince me . This isn 't real , Jemma . This world isn 't real . He 's gonna kill her . Fitz would never do that . Are you sure ? Get back to the quinjet . I 'll deal with this and meet you there . Simmons : Stop . We 're going to need him . Need the doctor ? Are you nuts ? There 's more you don 't understand . I know everything i need to know . The man is a sadist , and I have a shot . That 's the mission now . Listen to her . Please . You know , you 've been lying to me since the moment we met . A woman 's life is in danger . I 'm done listening . You 're right . I haven 't told you the whole story . I know him , not as the doctor , but as a - - a brilliant , awkward , heroic scientist named Leopold James Fitz . He is a good man , and I love him . That woman , madame hydra ? She 's - - she 's messed with his mind . If you do this , i lose him forever . I will tell you everything - - everything - - I just - - i need you to trust me . Fitz would never hurt an innocent woman . Y-you 're right . The subversives are here . I-i-i-i see now , I should 've been more forthcoming . Please , put the gun down . I 'll - - I 'll take you to them . Tell me the truth . You act like you know me . Why ? The soldiers can find the subversives . We should be going . You were like a son to me . We worked side by side in the lab , on occasion , we 'd raise a pint - - or six - - watching football - - real football . That 's absurd . It 's the truth , my boy . You even helped me build aida . Enough ! We 're done here . Then why don 't i remember you ? Because it all happened in the other world . Aida : It wasn 't you , Fitz . It was their world 's version of you . And the woman ? Jemma Simmons ? Simmons ? You two were in love . Unbreakable . A force to be reckoned with . The Fitz I knew nearly drowned for Jemma . He crossed the bloody universe to rescue her ! You see what we 're up against ? They mean to destroy us . She lies because I 'm right . She 's trying to deceive you . I love you . They 're trying to take you away from me . The world has changed , but you 're not this man . You 're one of the good guys . You help people . Look inside . This isn 't you . you say that I 'm not myself . I don 't know who I am . It isn 't your fault , any of it . But you 're wrong . I know exactly who I am . Simmons : Fitz ! No ! get back ! now ! hang on to something ! How about that ? There was nothing else you could 've done . He killed Agnes . Fitz killed her . I 'm sorry . someone had better explain what the hell happened out there , pronto ! Ward tells me he had a shot on the doctor , but you stopped him . And that you 're in love with that psychopath ! We can explain everything . She says madame hydra brainwashed him . That 's a bold claim . You have evidence , or do we have to take this at face value , too ? She 's been through a lot . We all have . Step aside . This can wait . No , she owes us answers . This is wrong . We don 't even belong here ! None of this is real ! please ! She just needs some time . Burrows : Sir . A recon team found a civilian sniffing around one of our dead drops . He 's got quite the story . Mace : Well , glad somebody wants to talk . Let 's hear it . I met a woman today who was with S.H.I.E.L.D. Her name is Daisy Johnson . You might know her as Skye ? Hydra used me to ... Trick her and take her captive . No . Please tell me she 's okay . why are you here ? Today , for the first time , I couldn 't look my little girl in the eye . I need to make that right . I 'm here to help . I take it all back ! I 'm sorry ! I can beg ! I 'm good at begging ! Just tell me what to say ! Please ! Fitz . Hear me out . You and me ... We know each other . We 're friends . I can explain all of this . How curious . Someone else tried that today . Maybe you heard him just now , learning his lesson . Hoo . So , I re-ran your test results . Guess who turned out to be a potential inhuman . Go on . Guess . Ah , well . No matter . We 've got plenty of ways of making you talk . No , Fitz . You don 't want to do this . Yeah , I do . No . I guess you don 't know me at all . Robbie : They say when the rider burns you , he burns your soul . Hyah !

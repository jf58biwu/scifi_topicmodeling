 Something 's coming , a wave of radiation that will kill everything in its path . What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands ? A final Conclave ... one champion per clan , one death instead of thousands . Then whoever wins gets the bunker . I was fighting for us all . Skaikru will not take the bunker alone . We 'll share it . We are one clan . How could they do this ? Skaikru have betrayed us all . Bellamy , stop . The radiation is getting worse , and people are dying up there . You 're gonna have to make it a kill shot . It 's the only way you 're gonna stop me . We have a hundred spots . The other clans have all chosen their survivors . We have to do the same . The death wave comes in 24 hours . You 've got 12 to decide . Go ! Get on to your bunks ! Hey ! What the hell 's going on ? Move ! To the rotunda . Ethan ! Where 's my son ? Ethan ! Have you seen my boy ? Stop pushing . Stop pushing . Skaikru , you move ! - Dad ! - Ethan , where are you ? Dad ? _ _ _ Hey , hey , hey , where 's Emori ? I haven 't seen her . - Dad ? - Ethan ! Ethan ! Oh , thank God . It 's ok . - Emori ! - John ? Hey , did they hurt you ? I heard the warriors talking . There 's only room for a hundred Arkadians in this bunker . - Get off . - Go ! Move ! Jaha ! What 's happening ? That 's everyone . Close the door . Three out of four of these people are going to die tonight . You still think you made the right choice ? Just hang in there . We 're sending a team to get you today . You 're sure about this ? Yes . We need you and not just for the hundreds of things we know you can fix , but for the thousands that we haven 't even thought of yet . Thank you , Abby . I 'm just glad you 're all right . You 'll be , too . My brain is healing . The seizures have stopped . When I get there , we use the same procedure on you . You 'll be cured . Cured ? What 's she talking about ? We can talk about that when you get here . Our people are scared , Marcus . We need to tell them something . We just spoke with Raven . When she gets here , we 'll have all our essential personnel . How many spots does that leave us with ? Including the essential personnel and the places that we 're holding for the children under 16 , that leaves us with 80 . 80 . I can 't believe we 're talking about sending 364 of our own people to their deaths . We 're lucky they 're giving us any space in this bunker at all . Look . I don 't like it any more than you do . Then let 's fight this . No . Any sort of resistance will cost us all our lives . Our best course of action is to hold a lottery for the remaining spots . It 's not going to work , Marcus . It was your idea . That was for the chance to survive . And how is this any different ? Until 20 minutes ago , our people believed they were safe . They let down their guard . They picked their bunks . They unpacked their bags . They imagined their futures . You try to rip that from them now , and , believe me , they will fight . No one 's saying it 's gonna be easy , but we need to make the people listen to reason . Someone still needs to get Raven . I 'd like to volunteer . And I 'll join you . No . Someone else can go with him . Mom , look , Raven needs our help . I know the way to the island . I need to do this . Well , you be safe . There 'll be a place for both of you when you get back . - I 'll meet you in the airlock . - Ok . At these radiation levels , any amount of exposure is harmful . Keep the suit sealed at all times . You have 23 hours until the death wave hits . On a good day , it takes 10 hours to get to the island and 10 hours to get back . That doesn 't leave you much room for error . Mom , I know , ok ? We 'll be careful . I love you , Clarke . Don 't ever forget that . This isn 't good-bye . Mom , I know what you saw in that vision , but I 'm a Nightblood now , I mean , right ? Maybe it worked . Clarke , listen to me . I told you there we no good guys , but that 's not true . There are . You are . Even though I didn 't want to open the door ? Yes . There was no good choice . There never is . Take care of each other . Yes , ma 'am . You got room for two more ? Murphy , what are you doing here ? We heard you were going after Raven . We just want to help . I 've been to that island dozens of times . No one knows the water better than me . Maybe it 'll help our chances if we bring home the chosen ones . There 's a lottery . I 'll make sure that your name is in it . And Emori ? I 'll do the best I can . This way . What are you really up to , Murphy ? You killed us when you opened that door . You know that , right ? Oh , what , did you think our people are gonna waste a spot on Emori , on me ? We were safe , and you screwed us . You want to know what we 're up to ? It 's called surviving . There 's a bunker on that island . You 're our ride . That 's it . That bunker 's not stocked , Murphy . You won 't last 5 months , let alone 5 years . No . We probably won 't . At least we 'll survive the death wave . We can 't all be essential personnel or have a sister who 's queen of the Grounders . We have faced extinction before , and we have persevered , but we have always been familiar with sacrifice , and today we will be tested once again . The ground won 't be survivable for 5 years . We 've confirmed that this bunker can only generate oxygen and food for 1,200 people for that length of time . By mandate of the Conclave , our clan has been given 100 spaces , an equal number of spots as all the rest . To fill them , we will hold a fair lottery . We will hold a fair lottery , an equal chance for everybody . How long do you think the Grounders would last in here without us ? Our people know how to operate oxygen scrubbers and hydro farms . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! We 're gonna be running this place . We deserve more spots . I don 't like this any more than you do , but we must call upon the better angels of our nature to guide us . Like the culling on the Ark , some must die today so that our people may survive . What about her ? Is her name in the lottery , too ? We 're just gonna let some Grounder take a bed from one of our own ? Right ! No ! I say we let her own people save her . Everybody calm down . We 've come too far to turn on each other now . You 're just saying that because you know you 're safe . Let it go , Hardy . Let 's throw her out . Leave her alone ! Let her go ! Guard , stop them . Stop them . Get off me . Let go of me . Niylah , you 're with me . She 's safe . You now have one less spot to fill . Octavia , please . You got to stop this . You 're Skaikru . You 're one of us . I 'm one of you ? You made me hide under the floor . You floated my mother . I 'm not hiding now . Don 't do this . Every other clan has chosen their survivors , every other clan . Skaikru is no different . You have until midnight . Choose , or you all die . Are you ok ? They 're scared . We all are . It 's human nature to fight . I 'll never forget that you did for me . A word , Octavia ? I fear this will only get worse if Skaikru can 't decide . You know how this has to end . What if I can 't do it ? You gave your terms . There is no going back . I know this is hard , but you 're the champion , Octavia . Wonkru looks to you now . They will do ... what needs to be done . You just need to give the command . I 'm no champion , Indra . I hid . Ilian helped me . Roan helped me . I didn 't do this on my own . No leader ever does . It felt good to be safe . I never felt that way before ... like I had a home . Hey , your home is with me , ok ? Why did you come on this mission , Clarke ? Raven 's my friend . Yesterday , you were fine leaving your friend out to die , my sister , too , Kane ... I wasn 't fine with it , and you know that . Bellamy , I never meant to hurt you . Aiming a gun at me is a strange way of showing it . I didn 't pull the trigger . Is that supposed to make it ok ? Nothing is ok . Whatever choice I make , somebody always dies . Well , not shooting me , that was the right choice . - Look out ! - Oh ! Hold on . Are you ok ? - Yeah . You ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . He just jumped right out in front of us . It 's like he wanted to die . Stay here . I 'm gonna check the damage . Bellamy , Clarke , incoming ! Get behind me . John ! Emori ! Emori ! John ! They want our suits ! There might me more of them . We should get going . Echo , what are you doing here ? I know about your bunker on the island . I just saved your lives . I 'm hoping you will return the favor . Unless we can get another ride , no one 's making it to that island . Here goes nothing . - David ... - I know . Nate 's already put his name in , but I 'd like to give him my slot , too , if that 's ok . I want to give him the best chance . Of course . Ok . One minute . Sorry . It 's not your fault . Yes . It is . I opened that door . You did what you thought was right . Was it right , Marcus ? Yes . We do what 's right , and 364 people die . You saved so many others . You saved me , and I don 't mean just by opening the door . I don 't know who I am anymore . The things that I let myself do in that lab ... I told you , we will find our humanity again . I need you to pull 81 names from the bowl . Abby ... When that door closes today , I need to be on the other side . Please . I just got you back . Don 't say that . I love you , Marcus , but I made my decision . My life isn 't worth more than theirs . I need you to pull 81 names . Sir , can I talk to you ? Of course , Geoff . What is it ? If my name isn 't called , would you ... take care of my boy ? It 's not fair of me to ask . None of this is fair . Your son shouldn 't have to grow up without a father . We shouldn 't be lining up to die . We should be fighting for our right to live . How ? We 're unarmed , surrounded by hundreds of Grounders . If we don 't do this lottery , all of us will be killed . - Not if we have leverage . - Leverage ? If you can get the Grounders to open those doors again , I 'll do the rest . We save our people today , all of our people . Monty , do you read me ? Over . Here . Monty , do you copy ? This suit will prevent you from getting worse . It 's the best we can do right now . You 'll get used to it . Monty , do you read me ? Over . Roan banished me . I heard . Monty ... I was only trying to save my people . Monty , do you copy ? Is that so wrong ? Bellamy , come in . Do you read me ? Yes , Monty . I read you . Where are you ? Two clicks outside Polis . Almost there . - Everything ok ? - Not exactly . Look , Monty . I hate to ask you this , but we broke down on the way to the island to get Raven . We need you to come reel us in . We save our friends . I love you . You know that ? We 're on our way . Tell us exactly where you are . No . No , no ! Hey , hey . Hey , hey , Clarke ... Uh , you 've been exposed . How 's that possible ? She 's wearing a suit . I ... I , uh ... The seal of her helmet 's torn . Can you fix it ? We just need tape . That 's all . It 's gonna be fine . We don 't have any tools or weapons . So we give her the extra suit , then . - We don 't have another suit . - Yes , we do ! Take it off now . I saved your life . What were you gonna do if we didn 't get attacked , huh ? I mean , you guys seriously think she was following us out of the kindness of her own heart ? No . She was gonna attack us the second that we stopped . - Give me the suit . - Hey , Murphy ! Murphy , no ! - What ? - Look . You cut that suit , and it saves no one . I 'm not letting her die . Neither am I. Clarke , what are you doing ? I have Nightblood . Untested Nightblood . We 're testing it now . Take off her helmet . There . Quick . Ok . There you go . Bellamy , you there ? Come in . Yeah . We 're here . Head northeast from Polis , and , Monty , drive fast . We have to talk about it . Missed the window . Continue on to the island , we won 't make it back . What about them ? Do we just save ourselves ? Clarke , if Nightblood works , we need to get you to Polis , them , too . We pull in as many people as we can before the death wave hits . If your mom can make us all Nightbloods , we only need to stay down there until it passes . We can still save everyone . Just not Raven . We got here as fast as we could . Clarke , you 're exposed . Come on . - Let 's get you into the Rover . - No , Monty . I 'm fine . I 'll grab the extra helmet . Guys , come on . Planet ain 't getting any less irradiated . Here . Come on . I got you . The helmets don 't match . I brought the whole suit . I got this . - Help the others into the Rover . - Ok . Come on . Clarke , you need to put on the suit . It was for Jasper . At least now it 'll do some good . You should put it on . Jasper would want you to . If we 're still gonna make it to the island , we better ... We 're not going to the island . Yes , we are . Clarke ... Nightblood doesn 't work . We don 't know that yet . Luna got sick before she got better , so ... Even if you 're right , they won 't let us all into the bunker if I 'm still sick . It took days for Luna 's resistance to kick in , and by that time , the death wave will already be here , and all our friends will be dead . Are you ok with that ? You know I 'm not . Clarke , unless I am missing something , there is no other way for all of us to survive . What if there is ? Pei Chao . Sonya Hassler . Good . Nate Miller . Kimberly Ginsberg . I 'm not leaving . If your name 's not picked , I 'm not going , Dad . Hey , hey ... It 's gonna be wonderful , Nate . You 're gonna rebuild the world . Paula Sevaga . Jackson , will you take over from here , please ? Doug McCrae . We don 't have to do this . Please . No one wants this , but this has to be done . You 're wrong . Jaha has a plan to save us , but we have to stick together . When those doors open , follow my lead . It 's our best chance . That 's enough . We can 't do this . I don 't know about you , but I am not about to be led to the slaughter . I intend to fight . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Who 's with me ? Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Marcus . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? I am not losing 364 people today . I did not find this bunker just so we can kill ourselves in it . So you 're gonna what ? You 're gonna ... you 're gonna gas the Grounders , knock them out ? Is that it ? Yes ... And then we threaten to destroy the crops unless they make room for our people . You can 't be serious . Once we have the food , we have the power . We call the shots . We found the Skaikru armory . They are our guns now . We can 't wait any longer . Your orders ? I 'll be right beside you . Pass out the guns . There 's a thousand Grounders in this bunker . You 'll never make it to the food , even with the gas . We 'll see . Thelonious , just stop . Stop . It 'll be a bloodbath , and you know it . How many would have to die , all of them , all of us ? As many as it takes . If we fight , then we die . Just ... The time for diplomacy is over , Marcus . Now either you lead us into battle or get the hell out of my way . Thelonious just ... just stop . Stop . Just listen to me , I 'm begging you . You found this place when nobody else believed you . You ... you saved 1,100 Grounders . You saved humanity , but if you don 't stop now , you 're taking every bit of that salvation back . This is your moment . Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ... Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Your people need you . Listen to them . They wanna fight . How do we stop them now ? I 'll do this for you . No . My people , my responsibility . Now . This is how we save our people . Marcus , how do we choose ? We already have . Clarke 's list . It was always our best chance for survival . And I know where it is . This is how we save our people . He stays . No . The children , they stay , all of them . He goes . The son stays . No . She stays . She stays . She stays . Forgive me . What are you doing here ? We 're not leaving you behind . But there 's no time to get back . We 're not going back . We 're going up . Oh , don 't look so surprised . It was all your crazy idea to begin with . Space ? Uh , we don 't have enough fuel to get down . Sounds like a 5-year problem to me . You 're talking about the ring . Seems like a shame to let a good rocket go to waste . Uh , how do we live ? They left a water reclamator there , and we know that Go-Sci has an algae farm . We just get those two things up and running , and we have food and water . Algae salads and recycled urine . - Sign me up . - Better than dying . - Yeah . You say that now . - All right . Slow down . Breathing 's important , too . What 's the plan for oxygen ? Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker , I 'm guessing ... make that praying ... There 's an oxygenator there . We take it with us . You hook it up . Bob 's your uncle . You 're an engineer , Monty . You do know there 's about a thousand things wrong with that plan , right ? Yes , and every one of them kills us . Of course , staying here will kill us , too , so ... Raven , we need you to get us off the ground before the death wave hits . What do you say ? Can you do it ? What do I say ? I say that death wave can kiss my ass . Good . It 's settled , then . We 're going back to the Ark .

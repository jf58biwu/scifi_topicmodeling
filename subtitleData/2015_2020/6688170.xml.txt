 Hey ! You little pussy . Hello , Henry . Oh ... You can 't speak , but that 's normal . Well , it isn 't normal , but it 's only temporary , okay ? Do you remember how you got here ? That 's fine . That 's normal , too . Henry , wait . Wait . We 'll get there . Scan . Sensory processor activated . Relax , okay ? Scanning . - Video link confirmed . - Up . This next part might hurt . Maybe quite a lot . But it won 't last long , I promise . Almost there . Welder . You can do it . Wonderful , Henry . Squeeze . Harder . Cool , right ? Integument ? Please don 't move your hand . You probably don 't recall . But you were never a big fan of my work . Maybe this will change your mind . Right ? Memory 's a funny thing . I 'm an expert and I don 't know if you 'll ever get yours back . You don 't remember me at all , do you , Henry ? My name is Estelle . You and I were ... We still are ... Husband and wife . I love you , Henry . I can 't wait to hear you say it . Henry . His memories are still catching up with him . Oh , Jesus . I 'm Robbie . The sorcerer of sound . You are gonna love this . Because , sir , you 're gonna get to pick your own voice . Thank you . Thank you very much . Hello , Henry . Robbie . Oh , come on , they 're options . What white guy wouldn 't wanna sound like Louis Armstrong ? Just one more . Quick . Henry , I am your father . Robert , enough . Sorry , Mom . How about we use Henry 's voice ? Yeah , whatever you say . You 're the boss . Boring .. Security breach . Oh , fuck . Level 4 . Is this a drill ? What is this ? Security breach , level 4 . Lock the door . It 's probably a mistake . Estelle , call the base . Security breach , level 4 . Oh , no . Yes . Get up . Henry , right ? Please . Don 't . Shut up . How do you like the new you ? Did I interrupt the procedure ? Can Henry not talk yet ? No , he can 't . No . Don 't look at me like that , Henry . Your girlfriend here might have rebuilt you , but I gave her the raw materials to work with . And I mean really , really raw materials . What 's your name ? Timothy . Nice to meet you , Timothy . Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here ? Yeah . Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry 's understanding of how good he looks now ? Sure . His arm was shot off below the ... Below the elbow and the ... The leg shot off below the knee . And there was a football-sized dent ... Did you happen to see his head ? Yes . Do tell . Um , the skull was dented in and there was this ... His eyes were missing and , um , the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces . Just about right . What ? Shh ... I 'm bleeding , too . That was a little strenuous . Stay close . Henry ! Close it . Henry , come on ! Henry , try to keep up ! Shh . Come on . Kick it in . Come on . If Akan gets a hold of my work , men like these will be brought back from the dead to form his army . GO ! GO ! Henry , no ! Henry ! Take my hand ! Escape pod initiated . There are two pods . One . Marty ? Sorry , the man 's clearly gone insane . Marty , no ! Henry . - It 's yours . Get in . - Estelle ! Get in ! Get in ! Escape pod initiated . Altitude ... The chute ! The chute ! Pull the chute ! It 's going too fast ! It 's going too fast ! Hold on , Henry ! Oh , God . Akan 's mercenaries . Put me down . Put me down ! Henry . They underestimate you , okay ? Let them get close and then engage . Engage ! No ! Henry ! Fight back ! Come on ! No , stop it ! Henry ! You stop it ! You stop it ! What ? You stop it ! Estelle ... No ! Henry ! You 're a fucking rabbit in the headlights , aren 't you ? It 's all right . I 'm not here to hurt you . Is your speech module installed ? Shit . Well , at least we know you 're not deaf . It 's all right . You can put your hands down now . Three years I 've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin . Fuck 's sake , come on ! All right , let 's have a look at you . Open the glove box , please . Take out that whole contraption . You gotta untangle the wires . Is that a wedding ring ? Are you married ? How 's that working out for you ? Yeah , what a shocker . Right . Next , I need you to take your shirt off , please . Open up there . Yeah , those . Plug the jacks in there . Yeah , in there . So , your name 's Henry and ... Okay , well , the good news is that you 're gonna live a while . The bad news is that in this case , a while means 20 , 30 minutes tops , Henry . Unless you 're very , very lucky . Which you are . Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab . Hang on . Oh , shit . We got bacon on our tail . Unplug yourself . Put that away . There 's some clothes in there . Put the hoodie on . There 's not enough time . Fuck it . Just cover the blood up with your bag . Just stay calm and let me handle this , yeah ? That 's how it goes ... Bollocks . Fucking Akan , paying off the ... I 'm gonna have to hurt you , Henry , but it 's for your own good , mate . Just give me your arm ... Hey ! Shit ! It 's me ! It 's Jimmy . We 've only got a few moments until they run into us again , mate . Just ... Okay , just give me your arm . Okay , just relax . Here it is . Here it is . Come on . Hey , bingo ! This little fucker is how they 've been tracking you . Touche-co . In a few moments , your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down . Your friend Akan 's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry . Slick handles all Akan 's cops / guns / real estate ! A lot of other shit . This helpful dot on the map is Slick 's place . All you gotta do is break in there , kill him , open up his rib cage , take out his beating heart , and fucking eat it . I 'm kidding ! I 'm kidding . You don 't have to fucking eat his heart . Under his heart is his charge pump , yeah ? Bring that to me . Use this and I 'll contact you on this . That has gotta be the gayest jacket I 've ever seen . I 'll be in touch ! Henry . Akan 's already started . If we don 't stop him , he 'll have his army in days or sooner . You 're half machine , half pussy . Wait , wait . I can tell you something very important . About the man who sent you here . Oi , Henry . I 'm at this high-class establishment . Follow the dot and then just knock on the knocker . Get it ? Knock on the knocker ! Hi . I 'm a fucking car , baby . Lexus convertible ! Oh , that 's good . Yeah , yeah . Oh ! God , that 's amazing . Yeah ! Fuck , you 're late ! You 're late ! Ha ! The last 15 minutes have been a fucking roller coaster of emotions for me , mate . I didn 't know if I was ever gonna see you again . So I fired up some of this shit . Fired up my fucking nose . But there you are . It 's okay . You just lost power . Come on . Hey , there ! Bring me some of that strong Russian shit , ladies . Okay , now where 's that booster pump ? Where is it ? Did you get it ? Did you get the fucking ... Yeah ! Fucking hell . This is it . This is it , yeah ? Okay , hang on . Okay , hold this , lady . Shit . Okay , I gotta get this little fucker in there . Who am I kidding ? I 'm in no condition to do this . I 'm sorry . I 'm in no condition to do this , mate . I 'm in no condition . I 'm sorry . I 'm in no condition to do this . Oh , goodness . Oh , goodness , what have you done ? What have you done this time , Jimmy ? Are you still conscious ? Yeah . Hello . You 're gonna be okay . Just gotta get a little bit of power into you . Ladies , could you give us a bit of space , please ? Thank you . You 're a big deal , you know ? You 're not the only one wronged by Akan . You and I both want the same thing . This may hurt a bit . There we go . That 's wonderful . Now I can take you back to my lab . I 'm Jimmy , by the way . I realize this is all very confusing for you . But it 's better if I show you at the lab , yes ... Hello ? They 're here . They must 've followed you . I can 't let them see me like this . I can 't let ... I 'm sorry . I can 't stay here , Henry . I 'm sorry . Oh , shit . Ah ! Fuck yeah ! Fucking hell , Akan 's boys are here . I 'm gonna hold them off , yeah ? I 'm gonna hold them off , yeah ? More guns for you in the drawer , yeah ? Woo ! This is fucking war , baby , yeah ! Woo ! Fuck yeah ! Hi , ladies . I fucking had that ! Go , go , go ! Run , run ! The floor is fucking lava ! I 'm gonna burn this ... Olga ! Katya ! Sorry . Please , please ! Please don 't hurt me . I 've got a family . Is that your wife ? Uh ... Uh ... Don 't mind her , Henry . She 's mourning her late husband . I wasn 't betting on seeing you again . Your persistence is unparalleled . Quite exciting . Slick Dimitry 's services were excellent . I 'm just glad I never paid up front . I 'll tell Estelle you did well . Akan ! Akan , you open this fucking door , you hear me ? I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs . I 'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out ! You 'll go far , Henry , unlike this piece of shit . Hey , Henry . Put your gun down . It 's all good . Hey , hey , hey , hey - People , people . Chill out . Calm down . Now I 've shared something with you , I need you to share something with me . Where 's Akan going ? Mmm . Oh , shit , shit . Now that is my ego talking to yours . What do you want ? Higher self , ego ? Higher self , ego ? Higher self ! Higher self . Yeah . Okay . Akan 's convoy are taking the girl to his base . Ah , shit . Let me handle this . Let me handle this . I 'm sorry that you 're upset , okay ? Henry and I ... Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan . You wanna go on the bike ? You can go on the bike . Just ... Yeah , you wanna go ? Okay , go on your bike . Yeah , yeah , go on your bike . Fucking hell . Sometimes it 's easier just to say yes . Henry , catch ! God , I thought I 'd lost you forever , Henry . I was so scared . I was so scared when you fell . I thought I would never see you again . I love you , Henry . I love you . How sweet . If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea , I wouldn 't need sugar . Each year , 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia , and , at most , 50 baseballs . Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime . This is a rare surviving bat . Estelle . Would you please be so kind and stand up ? No . Or do you want to take her place ? Estelle , your boy 's quite the white knight , sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick to kill you later . Are you sure , Henry ? Are you sure ? Brilliant ! Uh ... Come over here , Henry . Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on , Henry . You little pussy . Give peace a chance , brothers . My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn 't . Jesus , baby . I was talking to that man . Shit . Look at this . Dude 's got a memory blocker . Well , that 's about all I can do for you , mate . Time for a reboot . See you in about 15 minutes , hopefully . HEY - He 's awake . Your eyes might be a bit blurry . It 's just your depth perception trying to calibrate , yeah ? Follow me as I walk , yeah ? Get up . Okay . All right . Now ... Can you focus on me over here ? Yeah ? Yeah . Burying you , it 's like burying treasure . I really don 't understand what Akan is thinking because ¡ ° . Ah ! Henry , stop dicking around . You 're almost there , mate . Here 's where you gotta get to . Chop-chop . Shh . It 's me , Jimmy . Move . Ah , shit . Those pigs are here again . Psst . Don 't compromise my lab . Let them leave . Henry , no . I 'm instructing ... Shit . Good job , Charlie Bronson . Bravo 2-0 . Lights UP - Play video . Dawn of twilight . A cyborg era . Thank you , sir . I 've lobotomized everything not essential ... Not essential to soldiers . Personal memories , speech , sense of taste . It 's all gone . Might still have a bit of an issue with emotional motivation , which ... Motivation ? Try your fucking paycheck , James . My ... Yes , okay . What the shit-fuck , James ? I 'm sorry , sir ! I 'm so sorry ! Oh , shit ! Open the doors ! Please ! Open the door ! We 've got a malfunction ! Let me out , please ! Sir , I ' fix it . I doubt it . Fucking idiot . You know , Jimmy , something about a spine snapping never gets old . It sounds like ... The end , the beginning ? Or are they the same ? Have a seat , Henry . When a man is first crippled , there 's always one question on everyone 's mind , especially his . Does his dick work ? Mine didn 't , so I plotted my escape from this chair . I had come to Russia when the west banned resuscitation of cadaver tissue . Akan 's a megalomaniac , but my research was funded . I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize . Who has time for icky ethics when he 's rich and his cock works , eh ? I paid a high price . I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded . I grew men made of cyberflesh . Really , they 're just fancy-pants prostheses , but don 't dare tell ... My avatars ! Now , cyborgs , on the other hand , have bits and a brain . They think for themselves , in theory at least . Shall we have a look at you ? That hippie , always with the ganja . You 're not baked , are you ? Hope not . All right . You are the man , Henry . Hmm . There 's very little actual man left , of course . Enhanced skeletal muscular systems , cardiovascular turbo boosted with a curium-244 atomic battery . A good night 's sleep and you 'd power an aircraft carrier . Remarkable technology , is it not ? Not you . My boys . I made the first few for revenge but then I started exploring new aspects of myself . Can I have a sip ? Mmm . I have lived these past years , Henry . My lads , they get speeding tickets , they walk barefoot through the grass , and boy , do they get laid . You 'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone . Hit play . Over there . Go on . I 've got you Under my skin I 've got you deep In the heart of me So deep in my heart That you 're really A part of me I 've got you Under my skin I 'd tried so Not to give in I said to myself " This affair never Will go so well " But why should I try to resist when , baby , I know so well I 've got you under my skin ? What is all this ? Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Something 's wrong with you , mate . Don 't worry , it 's not the clap or nothing . Just gonna sit you down in this chair and take a look at you , yeah ? The scan says you 're in terrible danger . Of being shivved for being a traitor , you lying grasser ! I 'm shutting you down , mate . Put down the proto baby . Now ! We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan . No ? What 's this ? What 's that ? You 're broadcasting that to Akan ! Enough ! Enough . Even if I did believe you , I still have to ... Fuck ! Henry , no ! No ! You brought them to my lab ! I trusted you ! Henry , please kill me . Akan won 't . He 'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten , smelly skin ! What the fuck was I thinking that Akan 's toy robot was my friend ? Thank you , Henry . Fuck you , too , but mostly thanks . My lab 's compromised , but I can build a new one using Akan 's equipment when we go get your wife together , right ? Hey , put that on the wall . If I can 't have my lab , no one 's having her . Now , don 't lose this . Fuck you , Akan . And don 't change your channel . We 're coming right over . All right , I counted six vehicles . That 's at least 35 men . We 've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive . Also , there 's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals . I just wanna get it out there right now that I 'm straight as an arrow . Got it ? Here they come . Wait for it . Wait for it . Now . Hey , cover me . Fuck , they 're in the hotel . We don 't need the sniper anymore either . Go inside . See the colonel . Over here , laddie . Arm yourself to the teeth . Don 't touch that . Imogene 's mine . That 's what my father used to say . " A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay . " Come along . Chop-CF " ) ? Big Sally . Eh ... Well , home is where the battle is . Right , private , it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple , understood ? Follow on . If you can hear them , but you can 't shoot them , you can probably grenade them . Drop an egg down there , laddie . Forward . Come along . Good Lord , how embarrassing . Dodged a bullet on that one . I 'll cover you . You go around them . Don 't let the cripple get below you , laddie ! Jolly good . Pull your weight ! Help me with the cripple . Retreat five paces back on my command , laddie . Spasibo , Yuri . My quarters are actually up there . Would you like to see them ? Oh , we will . Indeed . Don 't spare the horses . You can take the next slipway . Off here . Here we go . Down on anchors , laddie . Let 's turn the tables on these buggers . Tally-ho . Big Ben . Akan is a cunt . Oh , my - Looks like Akan 's already begun . By tomorrow , these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself . Look out ! On your feet , lad . On your left . Hang on . I 'm gonna buy you some time ! Seal the door . Can 't tell you the number of times I 've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift . It 's a pity I can 't ... It 's just the landing gear , laddie . Now , listen to me . When you kill Akan , I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are , understood ? No , I 'm afraid I shall not be coming with . But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years . No . It 's lodged in his jugular . If you uncork it , I won 't be able to ... The thingamajig in your pocket , quickly . Well , I have a confession to make . See , I 've been surveilling Akan for years . So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so magnificently , well , all I saw was my shot at revenge . You proved me right with Dimitry , but then in the forest , well , I noticed an implant . A memory block , see ? And I couldn 't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else . So I left it in . Not my finest hour , I 'm afraid . But then , back at my lab while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me , I realized who you are to me . Henry . It 's bloody nice having a friend , Henry . You 'd think all those deaths would 've prepared me for this . If you haven 't already , you 'll start to remember bits from your past now , Henry . And those memories , they 're real . They 're you . Trust them . Memories , memories , memories . My first batch of cyber soldiers . With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what 's left of their brains , all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on . I love you , Charlie . I love you , Edward . I love you , Thomas . You recognize these ? No ? That 's odd . They 're your wife 's . Mmm ... L smell what you like about her . This one is almost ready for you . But I 'm warning you , their boosters make the one you have in you now ... Look like a fucking 9-volt . Go ahead and fuck him up . Get up . Get up ! Can you handle this ? Henry . Why are you hitting yourself , Henry ? Hmm ? Baby ? Baby , are you okay ? I love how protective you are of me . Mmm ... You owe me an apology . For ? Doubting me . I did have certain apprehensions . Then Why 'd you let me do it ? I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men . Is everybody dead ? Yes . Yes . Do you know when I realized this was working ? When ' ? When Henry pulled me into the escape pod , trying to get me out of the lab no matter what . Who would 've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator ? Ah . We 'll have a hundred of you tomorrow , a thousand next week . Each one 's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger . Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him , whether it 's marching on Paris or the White House lawn . I would like to pretend you understand the part you played . You didn 't make history , Henry . You helped end it . Mmm ... You little pussy . That 's what my old man called me . It 's like it was my name . And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people . I love you , Henry , and I 'll never call you anything but your name , but you gotta decide . Are you gonna lay there , swallow that blood in your mouth ? Or are you gonna stand up , spit it out , and go spill theirs ? Akan ! You fuck ... No ! Stop ! I am ordering you to stop ! Henry ! Stop ! Where is he ? No . Fuck you , motherfucker ! FUCK you ! How could you do this to me , Henry ? How could you fucking do this ? Answer me ! Answer me ! Motherfucker ! What happened , Henry ? You were supposed to love me . Henry ! Henry ! Listen to your heart ! Hello , Henry . Well , if you 're hearing this , there 's one more thing I need you to do .

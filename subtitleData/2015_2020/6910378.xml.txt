 Keep moving . Alright we got it , we got it . Almost there . - Come on , come on . - Hold steady . - A few more steps . - That should be okay . Oh , careful , careful . Oh . David ... OK , OK , easy , easy , easy . Oh . Careful . Careful . - David . - Give me morphine . I got it , I got it , I got it . Yes , come on . David . All right , tough girl , this will ... I met your husband . Careful . He 's a beat poet . I 'm you . I 'm me . I 'm everything you wanna be . He got the bullet out . Stopped the bleeding . Do you have a minute ? 'Cause ... well , yesterday we did some digging into your past ... what 's real , and I think we may know ... I know what I am . You do ? I 'm the magic man . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I just wanted you to know I found a way for us to be together . I don 't understand . It 's all an illusion . I see that now . Why 'd I fight so hard ? Where are we ? It 's just a room by a beach . I made it . They 're signals , that 's all . What you see , what you hear . Impulses sent from nerve endings . Electricity in the brain . Real , fake . It 's all the same . You know , they say the brain is the largest erogenous zone . How did ... how did you ... We 're not really touching . You 're so beautiful . How is she ? The swelling is down , but she 's not responsive . Can 't you just absorb her ? Fix her that way ? I 'd go into shock . It 's a ... very delicate ecosystem . He saw him , Cary . Oliver . In the Astral Plane . He told you ? He can bring him back . I know it . Class starts in 5 minutes . I know where they 're holding Amy . I 'll be going to get her in the morning . David , we talked about this . I 'm not asking you to go . Well , I 'm going . These things take time . To scope . To observe . Who ? How many ? Defenses ? Not just military . They have their own special help . People like you . Sydney , you saw this with Walter . I 'll be fine . Maybe ... if we surprise them . But , no . They know . You can 't help her . Not yet . Aren 't you gonna ask about him ? The diver ? How does he look ? He looks good . Strong . He lives in an ice cube . I don 't understand . How long has he been in there ? The astral whatever ? In February , it 'll be 21 years . You know , David ... In the beginning , he was just like you . Same kind of power . Psychic . Then he found a place where he could rule . Be the creator . Then he ... started spending more and more time there . Sometimes I 'd just find him sitting ... someplace just staring into space . And then one day he just didn 't wake up . Did he ask about me ? He remembers very little , I think . Facts . He makes his own reality now . But there was a moment . Can you ... Can I see him ? You want me to take you there ? No . I just want you to bring him home . Hi . Miss me ? Yes . Are you ready ? Yeah . It 's okay . I got you . Elevator going up . Mind the doors . Assending . Are we really going to D3 tomorrow ? It 'll be fun . Kick some ass . Save the girl . Get a snack . They 'll kill us . You know that , right ? They 'll try . Can we go back ? Was that your first time ? No . My first time was ... he was one of my mother 's boyfriends . Your ... I was 16 . He was a journalist . We had a flirtation and I was curious . One night , they had too much to drink . My mom passed out on the couch . I heard him in the bathroom taking a shower , so I touched her hand , and then I was her . We went into the bathroom . But ... the switch didn 't last long then , and when he was inside me , I changed back . And then my mom was there , and everybody was screaming . Who teaches us to be normal when we 're one of a kind ? Just promise me , if you get lost , we get lost together . What about strength in numbers ? I mean , we can bring ' em as cannon fodder , but they 're just gonna slow us down . It 's about Amy , right ? Saving Amy ? Come on , forget these losers . You saw what happened when we worked together . Our muscle . These D3 patsies aren 't gonna know what hit ' em , but we have to go now and we have to move fast . Just promise me we 'll come back here when we have her . Mon frère , I love it here . All these shinny happy people . David ? Time to go . It 's a facility in the woods , so we have to go in on the ground . By which I mean , we definitely should not go in on the ground . That 'd be dumb . He 's gone . - Who ? - David . He ... I heard voices , looked for him everywhere . He 's not here . Think he went to D3 . Shit . Wake everyone . We 're going ? To Division Three ? Now ? No plan . No intel . Just chickens with our heads cut o ... - He needs us . - Then why 'd he leave ? The sense I get with that guy is , he 's only ever thinking about numero uno . So no , thank you . They have his sister . You don 't think I have a sister ? Or a girlfriend ? Or a mom ? This is war . We 're fighting a war . It 's bigger than some guy named David and his sister . We can 't lose him . Why ? 'Cause you think he 's going to bring Oliver back ? No ... because he 's too powerful . If they turn him ... Sydney , were you with him before ? How did he seem ? David ? He 's ... Something 's changed . He , uh ... Found a way for us to be together . A place . Did you tell him what you found out there ? Philly ? Dr. Poole ? No . We did other things . Sydney ... I think we need to work together here . David 's treatment is not ... Lady ... I 'm not treating him . He 's my man . Which means , I care about what he wants . What we want . I could give a shit about how he fits in here . I 'm just saying be careful . - David 's very fragile . - He doesn 't seem fragile . Not since he came back . I know . And that worries me . Promise me , if you get lost , we get lost together . Ready ? Move , move , move ! This way . You ... go that way . We 'll go this way . Let 's go . Hello . Sydney . Oh , thank God . You have to please just ... open the door . Where 's David ? He was here . His sister was in the next cell . I told him ... before , not now ... but they took her . But that 's what they do . They come , they take us away . Questions . Always the same questions . He said he was gonna let me out , but he didn 't . Could you ? Please ? Where do you they take you when they come ? The light . The room with the big light . There 's a switch . The door opens on its own . Please , Sydney . Let me out of here . Bitch . - Anything ? - No . But they record everything , so ... Miss Bird ? I see it . I just heard my sister . That wasn 't a memory . - Hey , don 't move . I got ... - What ... Don 't move . I 'll be right back . Yes , I checked that . No , I-I can 't stay still . I 'm working . Did you ... did you leave ? Well , I know . I ... it hurts me too . Hello ? Did you have to let him kick you in the crotch so many times ? Maybe you should just , uh ... watch my back . Come on . Okay . I 'm done with this shit . All right . We ... were wrong . We ... had it all wrong . Where 's David ? He took her . His sister . We knew he 'd come . We were ... Ready . We thought ... we were ready . What happened ? So much power . It wears ... a human face . What ? Be careful . It ... It ... wears ... A human ... Face . Syd . I don 't understand . Miss Bird ? Hello , Miss Bird ? Cary ? What ... what did you find ? It 's complicated . David was here . He took Amy . Everyone is dead . - I think we were wrong . - No . The whole approach . Treating him ... like the others . He is schizophrenic . This is not mental illness . I mean split mind . This monster isn 't David . It 's a parasite of some kind . You see ? Another consciousness inside of him . What does that mean ? This thing ... burrowed into David 's brain when he was a boy , maybe even a baby , and it has been there , feeding on him , ever since . - The memories . - The memories ... exactly ! Every time David sees this thing , or ... or realizes it 's there ... this creature makes him forget . It rewrites his memory . Is that why we couldn 't see it ? I think so , and I think it made you forget as well . I mean , the ... the power of this thing . You 're saying it has power , not David ? No , no . David is a very , very powerful mutant . He has to be , otherwise this thing would split him apart . You 're ... you 're calling this thing " It , " but what else could it be if not another mutant ? An older mutant . Its consciousness separated from its body , you see ? And living inside David for ... 30 years . Sydney . David ? Thank God .

Everything seems so small now . I can 't believe you ... what you did to ... to save me . I didn 't know . You knew . I was scared . Well , you don 't have to be scared anymore . Are you ... did we come here for a reason ? The old house . Don 't you have a ... they made it sound like you were part of a team with , like , a-a headquarters . They 'll be here soon . I thought we could ... Talk first . Okay . Yeah , um ... What do you wanna talk about ? I wanna know your secret . - What do you ... - I can smell it . See ? The secret . Probably always , but now it 's really clear . You know something about me . David . Wha ... Hi . Look at you . She 's actually got kind of a hot bod under all that tight ass house frau bullshit . Who are you ? I 'm David . Oh , wait , I 'm Benny . You mean I 'm Lenny . Or is it ... King ? Oh , or , or is it my favorite ... No , no , no ... No , no , no ... You have a secret . No , stop ... stop . Please . My whole life is a lie . I just need to know . Who am I ? You ... you were adopted . Who ... I don 't know . I was young . Mom and dad , they ... they were going ... they were gonna tell you ... But then they ... and I just ... and you were ju ... you were so upset all the time . - The illness ... - I don 't have an illness . I know . I know . Now . I don 't ... I don 't know , I-I just thought ... if I told you , it would ... it would make things worse . Exactly . This will ... may isolate the entity , paralyze it , letting us talk to David privately . Well , I don 't think it 's a very good idea either , but they ... we don 't have any choice . You will just have to ... maybe there won 't even be a fight . Don 't kid yourself , old man . There 's always a fight . Wait . Be careful . There 's a chance we 've left the real world and that we 're in David 's world now . And that 's bad why ? Well , that would make him God and he 's crazy , so ... Stop it . He 's not crazy . This is much , much wo ... Hey , gorgeous . No , no , no , no . This is not the talking place . This is the listening place . Such a pretty boy . And then you people ... Starting putting all these ideas in his head . Sydney ! No , no , come ... - No . - David . White room . Now . Syd ... - I can 't stop her . - David . Me . David . Listen to me . David ? David ... David . me . It 's not ... David ! Dav ... David ... Dav ... It 's ... Dav ... Hello , everyone . Tonight 's movie is " Singing in the Rain . " Bring your blankets and ... for a ... good time . Sydney ? I 'm sorry . What was I saying ? Uh ... you were saying ... You were talking about how the death of your father affected you , and I think that 's very brave . Okay . Let 's talk .

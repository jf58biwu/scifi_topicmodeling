Okay , we just wasting time we dont have . I need to speak to Saw Gerrera I need to tell him before its too late . ( foreign ) Keeps your heads down ( foreign ) The imperials will be searching for him ... We need to get to Jedah city ? What part of ' Urgent message do you guys not understand ? We are all on the same side If you see past the uniform For a minute , I 've got ... WOBANI IMPERIAL LABOUR CAMP ( chains clanking ) What now . I don 't know , must be another pick up . I thought we had everybody . ( Door blasts open ... blaster firing ) All clear sir ! Congratulations ! You are being rescued Please do not resist YAVIN 4 Rebel Alliance headquarters ( Indistinct chatter ) You 're currently calling yourself Leana Hallik . Is that correct ? Possession of unsanctioned weapons , Forgery of Imperial documents . Aggravated assault , escape from custody , resisting arrest . Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were , Jyn Erso That is you given name , Is it not ? Jyn Erso , daughter of Galen Erso . A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development . What is this ? Its a chance for you to make a fresh start . We think you might be able to help us This is capt . Cassian Andor , rebel intelligence . When was the last time you were in contact with your father ? - Fifteen years ago . - Any idea where he 's been all the time ? I 'd like to think he 's dead . Makes things easier . Easier than what ? That he 's been a tool of the Imperial war machine ? I 've never had the luxury of political opinions . Really ? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera ? Its been a long time . But he 'll remember you though ... Wouldn 't he ? He might agree to meet you if you came as a friend . We 're up against the clock here girl so if there 's nothing to talk about we 'll just put you back where we found you . I was a child . Saw Gerrera saved my life . He raised me , but I have no idea where he is I haven 't seen him in years . We know how to find him . Thats not our problem . What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed . You 're rebels aren 't you ? Yes . But Saw Gerrera is an extremist . He 's been fighting on his own since he broke with the rebellion . His militancy has caused the alliance a great many problems We have no choice now , but to mend that broken trust . What does this have to do with my father ? Theres an imperial defector in Jedah . A pilot He 's been held by Saw Gerrera . He is claiming the emperor is creating a weapon . With the power to destroy an entire planet . The pilot says he was sent by your father . We need to stop this weapon before it is finished . Capt Andor 's mission is to authenticate the pilot 's story and then if possible , find your father . It appears he is critical to the development of this super weapon . Given the gravity of the situation , and your history with Saw , We 're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the senate for testamony . And if I do it , We 'll make sure you go free . Capt. Andor . Im K2So I 'm a reprogrammed imperial droid I remember you . I see the council is sending you with us to Jedah . Apparently so . That is a bad idea . I think so and so does Cassian . What do I know ? My specialty is just strategic analysis . Gerrera knows vitals of the empires weapon 's program . Forget what you heard in there . There will be no extraction . You find him , you kill him . Then and there . - You met K2 ? - Charming ! He tends to say whatever it comes into his circuits . By-product of their re-programming . Why does she get a blaster and I dont ? What ? I know how to use it . Thats what Im afraid of . Give it to me . We 're going to Jedah . Thats a war zone . Thats not the point ... Where 'd you get it ? I found it . I find that answer vague and unconvincing . Trust goes both ways ( Walks away ) You 're letting her keep it . Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you ? Its high . - Lets get going . - its very high ( Tin legs walking ) Lies ! Deceptions ! Lets see it . Bodhi Rook ! Cargo palace . Local boy huh ? ( Foreign ) Found this in his boot when he was captured . I can hear you . I defected ... I defected . Everyday ... more lies ! Lies ! Would I risk everything for lies ? We don 't have time for this . I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before he ... Uh ... Okay . So you ... Um ... Thats for you . And I gave it to them and they did not find it . I gave it . Galen Erso , he told me to find you . ( takes deep breath on the respirator ) ( Foreign ) Po Gaelik ( Bodhi Repeats ) Po ... Gaelik ? Galen Erso sent me ... he told me to find you . Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedah director Krennic After so many setbacks and delays and now this . We 've heard word of rumours circulating through the city . Apparently you 've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot . If the senate gets wind of our project , countless systems will flock to the rebellion . When the battle station is finished , the senate will be of little concern . When has become now director Krennic , the emperor will tolerate no further delay . You have made time and ally of the rebellion . I suggest we solve both problems simultaneously . With an immediate test of the weapon . Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience I will not fail . Whats the matter Jyn ? You look afraid . I 'll always protect you . Stardust Don 't ever change Trust Galen . You have controls Thats Jedah . Or whats left of it . We find Saw , we find your father . Whats with the destroyer ? Its because of your old friend Saw Gerrera . He 's been attacking the cargo shipments . What are they bringing in ? Its what are they taking out . Kyber crystal ... all they can get . No wonder why they were stripping the temple , Now we know Its to feel for the weapon . The weapon your father 's building ? Maybe we should leave 'target-practice ' behind . Are you talking about me ? She 's right . We need to blend in . Stay with the ship . I can " blend " in , Im an imperial droid . The city is under imperial occupation . Half the people here would want to re-program you . The other half would want a hole in your head . Im surprised you are so concerned with my safety . Im not . I just worried that they might miss you And hit me . Doesn 't sound so bad to me . ( Creature growling ) po gaelik can see you ... your thoughts No lie , is safe . What had you really brought me , cargo pilot ? ( ganglion ) will know the truth . It causes side effect . That is one can lose one 's mind . ( Indiscernible chattering in the street ) - You just mind yourself - We don 't want any trouble , sorry C 'mon ... c 'mon ... you must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot . A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded . I had a contact ... one of saw 's reps . But he 's just gone missing . His sister will be looking for him . Temple 's been destroyed , but she 'll be there waiting . You will give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw . Hope ? Yeah . Rebellions are built on ' Hope ' . Hands where I can see them . Get over there . Show me some identification. check inside Is this all because he 's a pilot ? Wait for me . Would you trade that necklace for a look into your future ? Yes , Im speaking to you . Im Chirrut Îmwe How 'd you know I was wearing a necklace ? For that answer , you must pay . What do you know about Kyber crystals ? My father he , he said that they powered the jedi 's light sabres Jyn ! C 'mon , lets go The strongest stars have hearts of kyber . Lets go . We 're not here to make friends Who are they ? The guardians of the wills Protectors of the Kyber temple But there is nothing left to protect Now they are just causing trouble for everybody . You seem all tensed all of a sudden . I have to hurry This town is ready to blow . Tell me you have a back up plan . ( explosion ) ( blasters firing ) ( chaos ... screaming ) ( Child wailing ) Jyn No ! ( Mother and child both wailing ) Hit the towers . Get out of there . Kyber ... kyber ! C 'mon This way ! Cassian ! Did you know that wasn 't me ? - Of course - I thought I told you to stay on the ship You did ... but I thought it was boring and you 're in trouble There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in . Freeze ! Right there ( Explosive detonates ) You 're right . I should just wait on the ship . Halt ! Stop right there ! Where you taking these prisoners ? These are prisoners ? Yes ! Where you taking them ? I am taking them to imprison them in prison . He is thinking of ... quiet ! You 'll get a fresh one if you mouth off again . We 'll take them from here . Thats okay . If you point me in the right direction , I can take them Im sure . - I 've taken them this far - wait you cant take them away You stay here ! We need to check your diagnostics . Diagnostics ! Im capable of running my own " diagnostics " Thank you very much ! Let them pass in peace ... Let them pass in peace . The force is with me , and Im with the force . And I fear nothing For all is as the force wills it . Hey stop right there ! He 's blind , is he deaf ? I said stop ... right there . ( blasters cocking ) Is our foot alright ? You almost shot me . You 're welcome . Clear of hostiles - One Hostile ! - He 's with us ! They 're alright . - Thanks - Cassian ... I 'm sorry about the slap . Go back to the ship . Wait for my call Is he a Jedi ? There are no Jedis here anymore . Only dreamers like this fool . The force they protect me I protected you . Can you get us to Saw Gerrera ? Saw Gerrera ! Can 't you see , we are no friends of the empire ? ( foreign ) Tell that to the one who killed our men . Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera ( foreign ) And why is that ? Because Im the daughter of Galen Erso Take them ! Are you kidding me ? ! Im blind ! ( speaking foreign dialect ) Im one with the force , the force is with me ( repeats ) You pray ? Really ? He 's praying ... It bothers him , because he knows its possible . ( laughing ) ... was once the most devoted guardian of us all . Im beginning to think the force and I have different priorities . Relax captain . We 've been in worse cages than this one . This is the first for me . There is more than one sort of prison . Captain I sense that you carry yours wherever you go . Hm ... Jyn ! Is it really you ? I can 't believe it ! Must be quite a surprise . Are we not still friends ? The last time I saw you , you gave me a knife and a loaded blaster And told me to wait in a bunker till daylight . - I knew you was safe . - You left me behind - You were already my best soldier . - I was sixteen ! - I was protecting you - you dumped me ! You was the daughter of an Imperial Science Officer ! People was starting to figure that out . People who wanted to use you as hostage . Not a day goes by that I don 't think of you . But today , of all the days ... Its a trap ! Isn 't it ? ( chuckles ) What ? The pilot ... The message ... all of it ! Did they ... send you ... Did you come here ... to kill me ? Theres not much of me left . The alliance wants my father . They think he sent you a message about a weapon . I guess they think that by sending me , you might actually help them out . So what is it that you want , Jyn ? They wanted an introduction , they 've got it . Im out now . Rest of you can do what you want . You cannot abort the cause The cause ? Seriously ? The alliance ... the rebels , whatever it is that you calling yourself these days All its ever brought me is pain . You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy Its not a problem if you dont look up . I 've something to show you . come . The Emperor is awaiting my report . One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion . And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment Your concerns are hardly warranted . If saying it would only make it so . All Imperial forces have been evacuated and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon . That won 't be necessary . We need a statement Not a manifesto . The holy city would be enough for today . Target Jedah city . Prepare single reactor ignition . ( machine Warbling ) Sir , we are in position . Higher ! Commence primary ignition . Whose the one in the next cell ? What ? Where ? An imperial pilot ! Pilot ? - I 'll kill him - No ... no ! Back off ! Back off ! Okay ... Are you the pilot ? Hey ! Hey ! Are you the pilot ? The Pilot ? Whats wrong with him ? Galen Erso . You know that name ? I put message on the pilot Im the pilot . Im the pilot . Okay . Good . Now where is Galen Erso ? standby . This is the message I was sent . Saw . If you are watching this , then perhaps I suggest to save the alliance . Perhaps there is a chance to explain myself . Though I dont hope for too much , A chance for Jyn , if she 's alive . If you can possibly find her . To let her know that my love for her has never faded And how desperately Ive missed her . Jyn , my stardust i cant imagine what you think of me . When I was taken I faced some bitter truths . I was told that soon enough Krennic would have you as well . As time went by , I knew that you were either dead or you were so well hidden that I will never find you . I knew if I refused to work , If I took my own life it would be a matter of time before before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project So I did one thing nobody expected . I lied , I learned to lie a man resigned to the sanctuary of his work . I made myself indespensable and all the world I laid the ground work of my revenge . We call it the ' Death Star' There is no better name and the day is coming soon When it will be unleashed . Ive placed a weakness deep within the system . A flaw so small and powerful they will never find it . But Jyn , if you 're listening , my beloved , So much of my life has been wasted , I try to think of you , only in moments when Im strong . Because te pain of not having you with me , your mother our family . The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now . So I try hard not to think of you . Think of where you are A stardust So , the reactor module thats the key Thats the place I 've laid my trap Its well hidden and stable . One blast will destroy the entire station . You 'll need the plans ... The structural plans for the death star to find the reactor . I know thats the complete engineering archive . In a databox at the citadel tower . Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module Will set off a chain reaction . That will destroy the entire ... ( Rumbling in the distance ) ( Rumbling increases ) ( Excited conversation ) ( Eruption ) Go ! Go ! ( Shouting in foreign language ) K2 ... K2 ! Where are you ? There you are ! Im standing by as you requested Although there 's a problem on the horizon Theres no horizon . Locate our position ! Bring that ship in here , NOW ! Where are you going ? I gotta find Jyn . - Get the pilot - we NEED him ! - A 'right ! I 'll get the pilot . Pilot ! No ! no ! no ! ( blasts door ) Lets go Jyn ! Hey . We gotta go ! I know where your father is . Go with him , Jyn ! You must go . - Come with us ! - I will run no longer . - C 'mon - but you must save yourself . - c 'mon - Go ! There 's no time ! ( Running ) Save the rebellion ! Save the dream . ( City breaking apart ) ( rebels shouting ) Ohhh ... Its beautiful . ( Rumbling ) Chirrut ! Lets go . C 'mon ! Lets get out of here ! Get us out of here ! Punch it ! - Im not very optimistic about our aux - Not now , K ! ( Aircraft takes off ) ( rumbling as Jedah is destroyed ) c 'mon ! - punch it . - I havent completed my calculations I 'll make them for you . I believe I owe you an apology Director Krennic . Your work exceeds all expectations And you 'll tell the Emperor as much ? I will tell him that his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the rebellion . That was only an inkling of its destructive potential . I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago , effective immediately . We stand here amidst my acheivement ... not yours ! Im afraid that the recent security breach has laid bare your inadequacies as a military director ! The breaches have been filled , Jedah has been silenced . You think this pilot acted alone ? ! He was despatched from the installation Edo Galen Erso 's facility . I will see about this . The coded message from captain Andor Sir . Weapon confirmed . Jedha destroyed . Mission target located on Edo . Please advise Destroyed ? Proceed Tell him my orders still stand Tell him to proceed with haste And keep to the plan . We have no idea what he is building for the Empire . We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance . ( indiscernible chatting on radio ) Baze , tell me . All of it ? The whole city ? - Tell me . - All of it . Understood . Switches off radio Set a course for Eadu - Setting course for Eadu - Is that where my father is ? I think so . So you 're Galen 's daughter ? You know him ? I 'm ... Bodhi , the pilot . You brought the message . - Yes your father ... He said I could get right by myself . He said I could make it right , if I was brave enough and listened to whats in my heart . ( Whispers ) Do something about it . He said it was too late It wasn 't too late . Seems pretty late to me . No . We can beat the people who did this . My father 's message ... I 've seen it . They call it the Death Star . But they have no idea there 's a way to defeat it . You 're wrong about my father . - He did build it . - Because he knew they 'd do it without him . My father made a choice . He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion . He 's rigged a trap inside it . That 's why he sent you . To bring that message . Where is it ? Where 's the message ? It was a hologram . You have that message , right ? Everything happened so fast . Did you see it ? You don 't believe me ! ? I 'm not the one you got to convince . I believe her . That 's good to know . What kind of trap ? You said your father made a trap . The reactor . He 's placed a weakness there . He 's been hiding it for years . He said if you can blow the reactor , the module , the whole system goes down . You need to send word to the Alliance . - I 've done that . - They have to know there 's a way to destroy this thing . They have to go to Scarif to get the plans . I can 't risk sending that . We 're in the heart of Imperial territory . Then we 'll find him . And bring him back , and he can tell them himself . Course set for Eadu , sir . EADU Imperial Kyber Refinery I 'm one with the Force , the Force is with me ( repeats ) 20 degrees to the right . 10 degrees up . No , lower , lower . LOWER ! Are you sure this is the way ? They have landing trackers . They have patrol squadrons . You 've got to stay in the canyon , keep it low . Watch your right ! There 's a 26 % chance of failure . - How much farther ? - I don 't know ... I 'm not sure , I never really come this way , We 're close , we 're close . I know that . - Well , now there 's a 35 % chance of failure . - I don 't want to know , thank you . I understand . - Now ! Put it down now ! - The wind ... If you keep going , you 'll be right over the shuttle depot . - Watch out ! - Hey ! Hold on tight ! We 're coming down hard ! ( conversation in the background ) - Try them again . - I am sir ... we ... The signal 's gone dead . Squadron up , target Eadu . How about now ? check stabilizers . - Bodhi , where 's the lab ? - The research facility ? Yeah . Where is it ? It 's just over that ridge . And that 's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us ? - You are sure of that ? - Yes . We 'll have to hope there 's still an Imperial ship left to steal . Here 's what we 're doing . Hopefully , the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here . Bodhi , you 're coming with me . We 'll go up the ridge and check it out . I 'm coming with you . No , your father 's message , we can 't risk it . You 're the messenger . That 's ridiculous . We all got the message . Everyone here knows it . One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down . That 's how you said it . The whole system goes down . Get to work fixing our comms ! All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we 're up against . So , we 're going to go very small and very careful of the rise and see what 's what . Let 's get out of here . ( thunder crackling ) Does he look like a killer ? No . He has the face of a friend . Who are you talking about ? Captain Andor . Why do you ask that ? What do you mean , does he look like a killer ? The Force moves darkly near a creature that 's about to kill . His weapon was in the sniper configuration . ( footsteps ) No , no , no ... We 've got to go up . You can 't see much from down there . ( Gunships taking off ) ( Announcements going on ) ( gravel slips ) This way . I 'll be right behind you . C 'mon ! ( trudging ) ( Running ... panting ) Where are you going ? I 'm going to follow Jyn . Her path is clear . Alone ? Good luck ! I don 't need luck , I have you ! ( grunting ) What are they doing ? If Cassian comes back , we 're leaving without them . You see Erso out there ? We 've come too far . Patience , my friend . That 's him . That 's him , Galen , in the dark suit . Get back down there , and find us a ride out of here . What are you doing ? - You heard me . - You said we came up ... - ... here just to have a look - I 'm here , I 'm looking . Go . Hurry ! Excellent news , Galen . The battle station is complete . You must be very proud . Proud as I can be , Krennic . Gather your engineers , I have an announcement . ( Running hard ) Is that all of them ? - Yes . Gentlemen . One of you betrayed the Empire . One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages , to the Rebellion . And I urge that traitor step forward . Very well , I 'll consider it a group effort then . Ready ! - No , please . Aim ! - and ... - No , no . - fire ! - Stop ! Stop ! Krennic , stop . It was me . It was me . ( Rain falling ) They have nothing to do with it . Spare them . ( Breathing ) Fire ! ( blasters firing ) ( Strikes ) How do I know the weapon is complete ? Let me share with you some details . ( yells ) Cassian . Cassian , can you hear me ? I 'm here . You got it working ? Affirmative yes , although we have a problem ! There 's an Alliance squadron approaching . - Clear the area ! - No . No , no , no ! Tell them to hold up ! Jyn 's on that platform ! Jedha . Saw Gerrera , and his band of fanatics . Their Holy City . The last reminder of the Jedi . Gone . You 'll never win . Now where have I heard that before ? Relay from Captain Andor . General . Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support . Alliance forces onsite ? Please confirm . Get the squadron leader on , Get him on now ! They 're already engaged , sir . ( Gunships approaching ) ( Gunships firing ) Jyn . No . Return fire ! To your stations . Get our fighters in the air now ! Father ! ( Conversation on comms ) - Go , go , go , go . - Fall back ! Fall back ! Director , we need to evacuate . ( Canon firing ) Papa . Papa , it 's me . It 's Jyn . Jyn ! Stardust . Papa . I 've seen your message . The hologram , I 've seen it . It must be destroyed I know . I know . We will . Jyn . Look at you . I 've so much to tell you . ( croakes ) Papa . No . No ... Papa ... c 'mon ! Over there , take them down . Jyn . We gotta go. c 'mon ! I can 't leave him , Listen to me . He 's gone . There 's nothing you can do . Come on . - I can 't leave him . - Come on ! - I cant leave him . - Move ! Down ! Come on . Come on . Well done . You 're a Rebel now . Let 's go , let 's go . C 'mon Lets move ! Come on , let 's get out of here . Move , move , move . Okay , K-2 , let 's go . Copy that . Ion thrusters low until we 've cleared the storm . Understood . You lied to me . You 're in shock . You went up there to kill my father . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Deny it You 're in shock , and looking for someplace to put it . - I 've seen it before . - I bet you have . They know . You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone . I had every chance to pull the trigger . But did I ? Did I ? You might as well have . My father was living proof and you put him at risk . Those were Alliance bombs that killed him ! I had orders ! Orders that I disobeyed ! - But you wouldn 't understand that . - Orders ? When you know they 're wrong ? You might as well be a stormtrooper . What do you know ? We don 't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something . Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you ? Some of us live it . I 've been in this fight since I was 6 years old . You 're not the only one who lost everything . Some of us just decided to do something about it . You can 't talk your way around this . I don 't have to . Yavin Four ! Make sure they know we 're coming in with a stolen ship . Anybody else ? My lord , Director Krennic has arrived . Director Krennic . Lord Vader . You seem unsettled . No . Just pressed for time . There 're a great many things to attend to . My apologies . You do have a great many things to explain . I 've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable ... potential . Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed . A city destroyed . An Imperial facility openly attacked . It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test . You were not summoned here to grovel , Director Krennic . - No , I ... - There is no Death Star . The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster . Yes , my lord . I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way . So I 'm still in command ? You 'll speak to the Emperor about — ( choking ) Be careful not to choke on your aspirations , Director . ( gasping ) We must scatter the fleet . We have no recourse but to surrender . Are we really talking about disbanding something that we 've worked so hard to create ? - We can 't just give in . - We joined an Alliance , not a suicide pact ! - We 've only now managed to gather our forces . - Gather our forces ? General Draven 's already blown up an Imperial base ! A decision needed to be made . If it 's war you want , you 'll fight alone ! If that 's the way it 's going , why have an Alliance at all ? If she 's telling the truth , we need to act now ! Councilors , please ! It is simple , the Empire has the means of mass destruction . The Rebellion does not . A Death Star , this is nonsense . What reason would my father have to lie ? What benefit would it bring him ? To lure our forces into a final battle . To destroy us once and for all . To risk everything , based on what ? The testimony of a criminal ? The dying words of her father , an Imperial scientist ? Don 't forget the Imperial pilot . My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this . So you 've told us . If the Empire has this kind of power , what chance do we have ? What chance do we have ? The question is ' What choice ? ' Run ? Hide ? Plead for mercy ? Scatter your forces ? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission . - The time to fight is now ! - Yes . Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha . - What is she proposing ? - Just let the girl speak ! Send your best troops to Scarif . Send the rebel fleet if you have to . We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it You 're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope ? Rebellions are built on hope . There is no hope . I say we fight . I say the Rebellion is finished . I 'm sorry , Jyn . Without the full support of the council , the odds are too great . General Bendola , please report to the briefing room . You don 't look happy . - They prefer to surrender . - And you ? - She wants to fight . - So do I. We all do . The Force is strong . I 'm not sure four of us is quite enough . - How many do we need ? - What are you talking about ? They were never going to believe you . I appreciate the support . But I do . I believe you . We 'd like to volunteer Some of us most of us , we 've done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion . Spies . Saboteurs . Assassins . Everything I did , I did for the Rebellion . And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in . A cause that was worth it . Without that , we 're lost . Everything we 've done would have been for nothing . I couldn 't face myself if I gave up now . None of us could . It won 't be comfortable . It 'll be a bit cramped , but we 'll all fit . We could go . Okay . Gear up . Grab anything that 's not nailed down . Go , go , go ! Jyn . I 'll be there for you . Cassian said I had to . I 'm not used to people sticking around when things go bad Welcome home . ( Announcing ) Bravo team to the Intelligence office for extraction mission report . May the Force be with us . Cargo shuttle , read back , please . What 's going on out there ? This ship 's off limits . No one is suppose to be on board until further instructions . Yes , yes we are . Affirmative . This is an impounded Imperial ship . What 's your call sign , pilot ? - Um . - We have to go . It-It 's um ... Say something . Come on . Rogue ... Rogue One . Rogue One ? There is no Rogue One . Well , there is now . - Rogue One , pulling away . - Pulling away . Despite what the others say , war is inevitable Yes , I agree . I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace . We will need every advantage . Your friend , the Jedi . He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor 's purge . Yes , I will send for him . You 'll need someone you can trust . I would trust her with my life . Captain Antilles , I have a mission for you . Senator . Okay , we 're coming in . SCARIF Imperial Security Complex Okay , we 're coming in . There 's a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate . This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through . Assuming , the Empire hasn 't logged it as overdue . And if they have ? Then they shut the gate and we 're annihilated in the cold dark vacuum of space . Not me I can survive in space . Okay . Here goes ... Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad . Cargo shuttle SW-0608 , you 're not listed on the arrival schedule . Acknowledge , Gate Control . We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station . - Transmitting clearance code now . - Transmitting . Cargo shuttle SW-0608 ? - You are cleared for entry . - Yes ! Impressive . I 'll tell the others . Okay . SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9 . Acknowledge , please . SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed . The main building down there , what is it ? That 's the Citadel Tower . They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there . If the plans are anywhere , they 'll be there . The dish at the top ? What 's it for ? I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out . Landing track engaged Landing track locked . We 're landing . We 're coming in ! Saw Gerrera used to say , One fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day . They have no idea we 're coming . They have no reason to expect us . If we can make it to the ground , we 'll take the next chance . And the next . On and on until we win ... or the chances are spent . The Death Star plans are down there . Cassian , K2 , and I will find them . We 'll find a way to find them . Melshi , Pao , Baze , Chirrut , you 'll take main squad , move east and get wide of the ship . Find a position between here and the tower . Once you get to the best spot , light the place up . - Make ten men feel like a hundred . - All right . And get those troopers away from us . What should I do ? Keep the engine running . You 're our only way out of here . Cargo shuttle SW-0608 , be prepared to receive inspection team .

There 's fighting on the beach , they 've locked down the base , - they 've closed the shield gate . - What does that mean ? We 're trapped ? We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet . We 'd have to get a signal out to tell them it 's coming . It 's the size of the data files . That 's the problem . They 'll never get through . Someone has to take that shield gate down . Bodhi . Bodhi , can you hear me ? Bodhi , tell me you 're out there . Bodhi ! Hello , I 'm here . We 're standing by . They 've started fighting , the base is on lockdown ! I know , listen to me !

Fire on my command . Look ! Get ready . We 're going to have to go out there . What 're you doing ? They closed the shield gate , we 're stuck here . But , the rebel fleet is pulling in . We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we 're trapped down here . For that , we have to connect to the communications tower . Now , I can patch us in over here , the landing pad but you have to get on the radio , get one of the guys out there to find a master switch . Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower . Okay . Then go ! What 's going on down there , Lieutenant ? Unknown , sir . We can 't raise them .

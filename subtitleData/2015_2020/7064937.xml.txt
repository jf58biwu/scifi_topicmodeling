 You must draw your strength from your surroundings . It can provide your escape , or be your trap . Father , are you okay ? Good . I will not always be able to protect you , my son . You earn your place in this world . Is that why we do this ? One day , I 'll be strong enough to go to Emunah . When my father was your age , Emunah descended into our world . Everything was engulfed in its brilliant light . They believed it would seal us forever in eternal peace . But when the eclipse ended , it was only darkness . We do this because we live in darkness ... and we must fight to stay alive . We must never stop fighting . Forget Emunah , my son , Dominion is all we have . I won 't let them take you . Father . This sword once belonged to the great King Araiah . May it spare your soul from evil . No ! Where 's the chief ? Dead . His daughter ... that 's their princess . She 's my last sacrifice to the Emperor . That sword ... it 's sacred . It 's been protected for generations . We believe it came from the very source of life . It is too late for you , friend . Give her to me . And I will do you the honor ... of carrying your corpse home on my back . I 'll bury you next to your father . If I don 't ? Then I will leave you where you stand and you will rot . Reiken ! The world of war has given birth ... to a great warrior . His enemies shall fall by a sword not of man . Who are you ? I am the King Araiah . You shouldn 't have come here . My name is Aysel . I believe you are here for a reason . Stay . Zera didn 't mean to harm you . She only wanted to know your soul . Who 's Zera ? She 's our princess . Princess ? You 're safe with us . We do not kill . This is Emunah . Your kind is not welcome here . - He is the prophecy ! - I didn 't address you . King Araiah spoke of this day . The day that our kingdom would finally be restored . The day that a hero of war would be sent to us ... from the depths of darkness . I have been waiting a lifetime for it . You should leave this place now and never return . Aysel ? Show me how to fight them ! I am them ! Not anymore . Their power is a lie , mine is truth . There is an animal within us all . The mask blinds it , takes us to a place where the soul ... our true essence , may be revealed . What we can see with our eyes is nothing more than an illusion . This is yours . If you believe the lie that you 're cold ... it will be a long night for you . There 's a cult wandering our lands ... disciples of King Araiah . The Emperor has deemed them as a threat to the Dominion . He 's called all Jaguar Knights to protect the princess . Why the princess ? You first . Come closer . Now kill me . What ? Kill me ! Come on , get up ! Kill me ... or I will kill you . You think you will defeat The Dominion ? They will devour you . Accept your Kingdom is gone forever . Draw your strength ... from your surroundings . It will provide your escape , or become the trap . Make it your weapon before your enemy does . When they attack , be waiting for them . Swallow their power . Turn it against them . Kill them through their weakness . You must be strong . Move faster . Come on , Aysel ! Aysel ? Aysel ? They 've come to enjoy the taste of blood ... even if it 's their own . Aysel has always dreamed of conquering man ... and restoring the Kingdom . It 's why he believes you 're here . Why do you believe you 're here ? To protect your people . The Dominion will never find us . I did . All you 've ever known is war . One self pitted against the self of another . It is the world of man ... And to you it 's real . It will be real for your people too , soon enough . Aysel knows there 'll be no war unless I declare it . And he 's wrong about you . You 've been chosen for something much greater than war . You have the power to open the eyes of all nations ... so that they can finally see that our Kingdom never fell . Is that why you saved me ? Saved you ? I was dying by the water , you healed me . Whoever saved you , it wasn 't me . Time of war is upon us . You 've trained us well . You have my gratitude . It 's time for you to go . If I go ... I 'm taking your princess with me . She was never our princess . Why the princess ? King Araiah believed that he had received a prophecy ... A prophecy instructing him to immerse himself in the living waters at the time of the eclipse . Doing so , he would be anointed to unite all men ... in peace for eternity . King Araiah had journeyed with his men to the living waters ... at the time of the eclipse . As he entered the waters , he was mortally wounded ... by a disciple most dear to him , his brother . When the eclipse ended ... Araiah lay dead at the bottom of the waters . His brother , who led the rebellion ... ushered in a new era of ruthless warfare . That disciple was our Emperor . If it 's true the princess is the only descendent ... of Araiah 's bloodline , then if Emunah returns ... we must bring her to the living waters before the eclipse . What are they ? This is the world of man . The world that gave birth to you and me . And this is the world of souls ... where our tribe has always dwelled . Remember who we do this for . Our time has come . I know why you 're here . I have a better offer . You were right , Aysel , it is clear to me now ... that this warrior was chosen . I relinquish my full command to you . You would hand over the fate of your people ... to a warrior of the Dominion ? You will never be one of us , Zera ! I am the one with the courage to fight for our people . I 'm the rightful heir to the throne of our fathers . And yet , they chose me . There will be no more waiting for our kingdom ... to be handed back to us from the sky . Tomorrow , I will leave this place ! And I will declare war on the Dominion and all nations ! A kingdom built upon evil ... will never be the kingdom of your fathers . Nor will the kingdom that is buried by it . Aysel ... you don 't have to go . Dad ! I found this place when I was a child . Suddenly , I found myself at the bottom of this very lagoon . And when I came to the surface ... Aysel and the others were waiting for me . He told me that King Araiah had chosen me ... to return the heavens to earth . When I was a little boy , the Emperor 's daughter was taken . He vowed to destroy every nation until she was returned . He then killed his own Jaguar Knights ... for failing to protect her . My father , he was a Jaguar Knight . Those who bring home the seed of a nation ... they are given freedom . The seed of a nation ? A princess . When I was young , I fought to redeem my father 's name . With time , I fought for what every soul wants ... freedom . What does your soul want now ? To forget ... everything . If your heart could forget the darkness ... then you wouldn 't be able to protect us . Without it , you wouldn 't have found me . We should have been home days ago . The stars are moving . We 're wandering in circles . Tell them I 'm sorry . No ! No ! No ! This place has never known death . Aysel was right . Time of war is upon us . Go , go , go . I want to fight in your army . You are young , Nikai . So was I. You miss your father ? You 'll see him again . He 'll be waiting for you ... in the reflection of your enemy 's dead eyes . Take a defensive position . Again . Concentrate . One more time , come on ! Concentrate . If the enemy senses your presence ... before you are in striking distance , it 's too late . He will outrun you , or kill you first . - Were you hurt ? - No . We should go . He was right . This is pointless . Nikai ! What are you doing here ? You shouldn 't have followed me . What are you doing here ? I 've come to fight alongside the true prince . Go . You disobeyed my command ! Let 's go . We were attacked by a Dominion war squad . They killed his father and captured the three of us ... alive to be sacrificed to the Emperor . An enemy tribe ambushed them on the way back . We freed ourselves ... and we killed them all . My dream of rebuilding our kingdom is finally coming true . And I won 't stop killing until it does . You once told me that your power is truth . And nothing has changed . Everything has changed . This land , all of it , is rightfully ours . It will be the land of our children . I will take it with my own hands , my own blood . Get up , Nikai , we 're leaving . Perhaps the time has come for us to return home . I can defend my people from the Dominion . I can protect our princess . You said she was never your princess . I will make her my princess . It is no longer your home . They are no longer your people . And she , will never be your princess . As I said , nothing has changed . He is leading a conquest . Swallowing entire tribes against all odds . " His enemy shall fall by a sword not of men . " These are the words your soul uttered while you were masked . It means Aysel is destined ... to be Prince of this world . No ! Why are you still here ? I buried my father here . I 'm not leaving him . The world of war has given birth to a great warrior . He will be grateful for the afflictions he has endured ... for the evil he has known . Attack ! No ! No ! Agh ! Zera ? Zera ! Oh , no . Oh , God . You will be a great warrior , my son . Though you were born into a world of darkness ... you will die in a world of light . For it will be you who marches the Sword of Orion ... into the heart of the Dominion . Ready yourself . You will be a great warrior , my son . Ready yourself . I will return for you , in this world or the next . Father ... I 'm scared . Fear is a lie . What are you doing here ? Why aren 't you at your post ? I 'm going back . You 're rebuilding our nation , Nikai . You killed my father . He left me no choice . He tried to stop you ... because he saw what I could not see until now . That you are evil and so is your nation . Nikai ... I 'm going back . To what ? To the home I never should have abandoned . It 's too late , Nikai ! They 're all gone . It was only a matter of time before the Dominion found them . Please ... my little brother ... Just tell me that he was spared ! Please ! Agh ! 23 years . Battling our way through the world of death ... only to end your journey in disgrace . Just like your father . You waited all your life to feel the Emperor 's hand ... over your head and grant freedom . But we both know , freedom is not what you 're looking for . We are warriors . Dominion is freedom , this is freedom ! This is not freedom . There is the fire . I first saw it when they drained your father 's neck ... in front of you and I saw it every day with every king ... you dragged along the land to meet his fate . And how does a boy get close enough to the Emperor ... to avenge his father ? A princess sacrifice . Do you really think I would let you get close to the Emperor ? She said you would come for her , but what I don 't understand ... why wasn 't it you who brought her here . She showed me something greater . Well , I 'm sorry , my friend ... the Emperor took her soul last night . Run , Warrior , while you have the chance . Go in peace . Running won 't give me peace . Then what will ? Vengeance . Get up . I 'll see you in hell , brother . This is hell , brother . A war slave of the Emperor ... frees the Dominion to pursue freedom . You will suffer a public execution ... a fight to the death and the fear in your eyes ... when you breathe your last breath ... will be your repentance . Fear is a lie . Your kingdom is a lie . Agh ! Father ! Father ! Father ! Zera ? Spare him . Spare him and I will return to you . No , Zera , don 't do it . Don 't do it . With all of my heart and all of my soul ... I will reign over this land as your princess . Zera , don 't ... don 't do it . Very well . I will spare him . Take him away . They took you from me , my only seed . I never stopped looking for you , year after year ... nation after nation ... princess after princess ... I never stopped . Father , it was I who chose to leave ... and it was I who chose to return . I realized that there was nothing to fear ... because even darkness is light . Father , I didn 't return to join your world . I returned to destroy it . The sword is sacred , given from the very source of life . Come closer . I brought the kingdom of our fathers to this world , Zera . Instead of being annihilated by the Dominion ... I harnessed their strength . I did what I had to do . This was the prophecy , Zera . We 're meant to rule the kingdom together . And tonight , I am your prince . You are prince of this world , Aysel ... but you will never be my prince . The world of war has given birth to a great warrior ... his enemies shall fall by a sword not of man . Aysel .

They want a truce . A truce ? Kidnapping children is the Neo definition of a truce ? You need to understand the benevolence on offer here . It comes from above . I 'm sworn not to harm a single hair on a single clone head . - ( panicked screaming ) - Now , where 's Helena ? - Uh , in the woods ! - What 's her back-up plan ? - I don 't know her back-up plan ! - You do . - No !

But it 's told to us to teach us something . - Delphine . - I 'm so sorry . - I thought you were dead . - I wasn 't allowed to contact you . Why are you here now ? Please listen . There 's no time . - Transport is ready . - Could you give us 10 minutes ? - What 's going on ? - Please . This isn 't what I want either . - Where are you taking her ? - She has a research trip . I 'm going to Sardinia . Sardinia ? We each have a role here , Cosima . I don 't understand . This place is insane ! What , you were saved by a 170-year-old man ? The science is real , Cosima . In here , you can 't make the obvious assumptions . It 's like nothing I 've seen before . You didn 't think it would be there . I need something to hold on to . This entire island ... is a decades-long pro-longevity study . - And everyone here is participating ? - Yes . Stem cell therapy , cryonics , caloric restriction , immunotherapy , cloning . When you think about it , if you want to genetically improve the human race , life extension is the first principle . This place ... this is the heart of Neolution . There 's a child and she has cancer . I 've seen others like her brought here for some ... - experimental treatment . - What does this have to do with me ? Rachel is ramping up their agenda and this has something to do with it . ( knocking ) It 's time . There 's a clinic ... across the camp with a red cross on the door . This is the key , okay ? Come on ! Let 's go ! I hid your treatment in the back of a fridge It 's ready , enough for you and Charlotte . - Let 's go ! - Okay ? Follow the crazy science . ( painful grunting ) ( dogs barking ) They 're scenting her this way ! So what are you waiting for ? Who 's hanging game way out here ? Just track the girl down . - That 's what he wants . - Move it , Amar ! ( dogs barking ) ( barking aggressively ) ( panting ) ( dogs barking ) Mommy . - Mommy , wake up ! - Ugh ! Mommy ! ( dogs barking ) ( dog 's cries ) Cooper , what the hell is going on out here ? Could it have been the girl ? - Nah-ha . - Then what was it ? - Must 've been the bear . - ( dogs barking ) ( Amar ) : It wasn 't a bear . Something stabbed it ! It was a bear . You got that ? It 's going to be dark soon . Let 's cut and head back . What about the girl ? Good luck to her . ( ominous music ) ( ominous music ) Hello ! Do you want to be left alone ? That 's a complicated question . I know . I 'm sorry about your friend . Yeah , well ... we never really had any , uh ... real control over it . ( vintage gramophone music ) Wow . Wow , it 's time ! It 's time ! ( vintage gramophone music ) What is going on ? P.T. has something to tell us . What ? ( applause ) Thank you . I am humbled to have pierced the veil and to address you on behalf of Mr. Westmorland . Like you , I was selected . I know now his hand guided my entire life . I know Susan Duncan , my mother , once stood here as I am , appointed to move the future forward . And she did . She created me . It is time to be brave , to sacrifice . The fruits of nearly 200 years of Neolution science are now within our grasp . And we , here , shall drink from the fountain first . ( crowd cheering and applauding ) ( dramatic music ) ♪ ♪ ( lock system chirps ) - Freeze ! - Woah ! On your knees , hands on your head . Okay . Just calm down . Oh , Jesus ... ( moaning ) Ouch ! Oh !

Uh , well , Rachel didn 't get all of it . You 're meant to put that in your uterus ? I was kind of hoping you would , actually . No ! No way . You and I are going to go find Charlotte and we 're going to get you to somewhere safe . They 'll treat you there . Who gives a shit if the founder of Neolution is still alive ? I do . You 're crazy . - We need to go , Cosima . - No , I can 't . What are you talking about ? Look . Think about it , Sarah . Whatever this place is , it 's the answer . I don 't give a shit . I came all this way . Rachel tried to kill me , Cosima . - You 're going to come home with me ! - No , you need to go back and take care of Siobhan and Kira , and I need to stay here for us .

It 's a new day , Sarah . - Kira ! - We 'd like to study her , here at Dyad . We found M.K. Rachel wants to restart human cloning . The easier you make this for us , the easier you make it on my new partner , here . My babies are special like Kira . They want our biologies . I know you created me , so what the hell is the point of all of this ? We are going to take such good care of you . You bitch !

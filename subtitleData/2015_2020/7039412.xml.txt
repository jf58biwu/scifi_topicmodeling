 Previously on Defiance ... I didn 't see Nolan . Someone took him . But he 's alive , I can feel him . I have chosen this human as my enchanted . My pet . My mother . You know where she is , don 't you ? I do not . She comes anywhere near me or my son , I 'll kill her . You 're going to help me hunt . What is that ? A control stem . What 's this thing on your neck . Did the Omec do something to you ? Yes , they did . What 's that ? A vaccine . You underestimate me , daughter . You have broken my heart . You left me no choice . Your strength will become my own . It is time to awaken and seize the world we were long ago promised . It is time for our Dread Harvest to begin . It doesn 't look infected . Any pain or numbness here ? I don 't think so . No . Okay , then . Wiggle your piggies . Piggies are what you call toes , not fingers . Is English your first language ? No . Then don 't correct me . Is English your first language ? If you have to keep track , you can 't call yourself fluent . Wait , you know I don 't like needles . Then hold your ankles and think of Charles de Gaulle . Ripped By mstoll Yewll ! Yewll , please . - Here . - Good . Please . Yewll . Yewll , what in the three hells are you doing ? Yewll ! Answer me , you shyster ! A shyster is a disreputable lawyer . I 'm a disreputable doctor . They 're controlling her . They stuck an implant in her neck . She can 't help herself . Doc , this isn 't you . You have to fight back ! I 've been trying . Unfortunately for all of us , I was engineered for slavery . I 'm sorry . It 's humiliating . Oh , Meh . I do wish I could spare you the terrible pain of embarrassment . I 'm sorry , Datak . You don 't deserve this . None of you do . Deserve what ? Deserve what ? Doc ! Deserve what ? Eyes out for Kindzi . You see her , shoot to kill . Any idea what she wants ? Nope , but I do know she 's got blood on her hands . T 'Evgin 's blood . And I 'm gonna make her pay . Kiddo , you 're with me . I want to circle back to the mines , see if we can pick up her tracks . Nolan . My husband is missing . We 're kinda busy right now , Stahma . I 'm afraid the Omec daughter has hurt him . What does Kindzi have against Datak ? What do you know ? She wants me dead . T 'Evgin was protecting me , but now he 's disappeared . Datak went to Doctor Yewll looking for a weapon to kill an Omec and now he 's gone as well . I know how you feel about me , Amanda . How you all feel . I would not come to you if I were not genuinely frightened . Stahma , T 'Evgin 's dead . Are you sure ? We were there . Kindzi ? Yeah . I 'm gonna go get her now . What the hell was that ? There are many of them . What ? In sleep pods , aboard their ship . Thousands upon thousands of sleeping Omec . T 'Evgin wanted them to coexist peacefully with the people of Earth . With him gone leadership will fall to Kindzi . Under her command , the Omec will attempt to conquer this planet . Enslave us . Ultimately , consume us . Come on . Those meteor flashes ? I think it is just the beginning . Thousands of Omec and you didn 't tell us ? T 'Evgin threatened me . I had no choice . Bullshit ! You could have come to me . We might have had a chance to stop them before it became a full-blown invasion . If you had not invited the Omec into this town , given them our gulanite , perhaps we would not be in this position in the first place . Don 't you dare put this on me . It is the truth . What are you doing with me ? No . Don 't , please . Please . The sun feels good . Why am I so weak ? You 've been asleep a long time . You 'll feel better once you 've eaten . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon . What will be over ? Please don 't leave me . Don 't leave me ! Please . Please . I have children . So do I. And they are hungry . No . Where is the All-Father ? T 'Evgin was murdered . BY Whom ? He was betrayed by a concubine . One of the lessers . A traitor among her own people . His death must be avenged . It will be . You ? I have taken T 'Evgin 's strength , I am the All-Mother now , and I will do whatever it takes to protect the Omec race . Enemies all around us . This is the curse of our people . I must grow strong . Nolan . What do you got ? Doc Yewll . What 's she doing here ? Oh , Christ . That poor woman . You 're gonna kill Kindzi ? Yeah . Doesn 't it make sense to interrogate her ? I 'll interrogate the other two . She 's got this coming . What the hell ? Get back to the car ! Go ! I don 't understand . How could commander T 'Evgin , a conqueror of many ages , be murdered by weapons such as these ? Are you calling me a liar ? Every conqueror has a limit . Even T 'Evgin . The Casti whore poisoned him . He died in my arms . And I ate his heart . Any more questions ? I meant no disrespect , All-Mother . Good . I don 't understand . When we were in the mines , two bullets took her down . Maybe she 's been eating her spinach . I don 't know . I emptied my gun into her . I shot her in the head . Damnedest thing . The ga-po-li-RAAZE ritual . The what ritual ? Ga-po-li-RAAZE . Taking-of-power . I 've been studying up on my Omec history . It 's a funeral tradition . Here . When an Omec commander dies , his children eat his vital organs and gain his strength . So now Kindzi 's as strong as her father was ? Well , assuming the book 's accurate , yes . T 'Evgin comes from a long line of commanders . He survived countless wars . So now his unhinged , unstoppable daughter is at the head of ten thousand Omec . We gotta get up to that ship . Cut ' em off at the source . How are we gonna do that ? Sprout wings ? I dunno , I suggest we find a way . We have a situation . Thirteen people reported missing in 24 hours . Omec . No . Doc Yewll . They were all on their way to doctor 's appointments . A bad tooth , broken wrist , pregnancy check-up . They never returned home . That 's why Yewll was in the field with the Omec . Wait . Why would she be working with the Omec ? It makes no sense . I suggest we find her and we ask her . In the meantime , kiddo , you and Berlin do a block-to-block search . Sweep the streets . Find those missing people . You okay ? I 'm fine . There 's no way out . There 's always a way out . You know I once spent six months locked in a cage . And that was ... That was worse because I was alone . You know who rescued me ? Joshua Nolan . I know they call him " The Butcher " , but ... I just think he 's amazing . Yeah , he 's swell . Yeah . Nolan rescued me once , and he 's gonna do it again . You know how I know that ? I don 't really care . I know that because of faith . Faith is a very important quality for a long-term prisoner . Faith gets you through the rough patches . And faith keeps despair far , far away . Do you suppose faith will prevent me from pissing into your cage ? Please don 't do that . Anything ? Not yet . People are scared . They 're staying inside . If I see any Omec , they 're gonna be sorry they picked this town . I heard T 'Evgin , before he died . The rest of the Omec aren 't like Kindzi . Well he 's wrong . You saw those Omec . They were eating a person . We don 't know what Kindzi 's telling them . Maybe there 's another way beside shooting them , one by one . Like what ? Maybe we can to talk to them . You 're serious . Okay . Well , if you can figure out how to say , " Please don 't eat me , " in Omec , let me know . You heard Nolan . Shoot to kill . We need more food . Bring out another one . You might wanna keep your voice down . The key to effective mass murdering is to keep your victims in the dark as long as possible . Do not lecture me . Sure thing , Boss . Please , no ! Let 's go , Jormir . No ! Please . Please don 't let the Enchanters take me . Please ! No ! Please ! Please don 't ! Don 't . Please don 't ! You , Castithan . I recognize you . You 're Stahma 's mate . I 'm also the last person you 'll see before you die . Your meat does not seem as tender as your wife 's . Surely this isn 't about meat . It 's about revenge . Am I right ? Revenge against the Votan races who rose against the ... enchanters and pushed you back to your home planet like a bunch of scared little bitches . And then there 's that unfortunate incident with your arks . I will not rise to bait proffered by a funny caged animal . Tell me . Millions of Votans and humans inhabit the Earth . How will ten-thousand Omec , even with a space ship , successfully conquer them all ? And once conquered , how will you control them ? Force ! The people of Earth will not surrender their planet without a fight . How many Omec fatalities will you suffer along the way ? How many can you afford to lose before your race can no longer sustain itself ? 3,000 ? 4,000 ? Probably less , when one factors in all the in-breeding . ALL-Mother ! Are you going to eat him ? I want this smug piece of white meat to understand that words have consequences . I am going now to seek out your wife . Before she dies sobbing and alone , I will let her know it was your words that killed her . You go near her , I swear you 'll suffer . The more threats you make , the emptier they sound . Trusted lieutenant , go greet the new arrivals and lead them here , to feed . Where are you going ... All-Mother To avenge our father 's death . Stay away from her ! Rayetso ... Doc ? Doesn 't look like she 's been here for a while . It 's okay . No . It 's not . Come on . Let 's go track her down . What 's the point ? How ' bout survival ? They keep coming , Nolan . More and more of them . And we have no way of stopping them . By my last count there 's six , plus Kindzi against the entire town . We can beat them . Can we ? Of course we can . Hell , it wouldn 't feel like home if we weren 't on the verge of annihilation . No , this time it 's different . This time it 's on me . I 'm so stupid . Amanda don 't ... I believed him . We all did . Yeah , but I got on the radio and I vouched for him . I ... I urged people not to judge him on the sins of his ancestors . I asked them to give him a chance . The stasis nets needed power . And you had to protect the town . You did not create this situation . I was warned repeatedly . I knew we were dealing with dangerous predators , I ... But I thought I knew better . I thought I could win them over . And I just opened the door to the Omec and let them come in and help themselves . If you hadn 't , Rahm Tak would have killed every human being in Defiance . Well , that would have been preferable to what the Omec have in store for our planet . I give up . When Irisa and I got back to Defiance , and I saw those stasis nets down , and the streets were empty , I knew this town was on the brink and I didn 't know why . I didn 't know what had happened , but when I was climbing those stairs , I was praying one thing . One thing only . That you were still behind that desk . Because I knew that if you were still in charge , that Defiance had a pulse . Now , if we 're gonna beat the Omec , and we are gonna beat the Omec , then this town is gonna need our mayor . I 'm gonna need her . Thank you . You 're welcome . Indogene ! My brothers and sisters are still hungry . You want me to burp them ? Bring me a native of Earth . A native , of Earth . Now . Coming right up . Stupid Indogene . You . Ginger . Wait , why me ? Why am I next ? That guy was here before me ! No I wasn 't ! He was here first ! No , I wasn 't ! You should be taking him first ! You liar ! Take him ! Hey , leave the ginger . Take me instead . I do not wish to sit penned up like livestock . I prefer to get this over with . Hurry up , shape-taker ! No . Why not ? Because I can 't bear to see it , okay ? Let 's go ! I 'll be right there ! I might not be able to say no to the Boss , but I sure as hell can say no to you . Come on , Red . Wait , wait . You 're not fooling anyone . What ? All this false compassion . The crocodile tears . You play at having a heart , but it 's a convenient fiction . You 're a conglomeration of stem cells . A machine that learned to mimic emotion through careful observation . - That 's not true . - No ? You 'd like me and all these people around me to believe that this ordeal is a deep burden upon your soul , but the truth is , you don 't have a soul ! You 're wrong ! You 're empty ! A golem ! Wow . You really want out of this cage , don 't you ? Meh , I 'm sorry . I just can 't take the waiting . It 's torture . If there 's anything left of a friendship between us , please ... Please , end this for me . Ride baby , Ride baby What you gonna do ? With that sun shining down on you ... Daddy 's bringing you ... Hey . Please don 't be angry . What ? Why would I be angry ? She insisted on coming . Okay . I don 't wanna hear it . It 's time you both talked . That 's not for you to decide ! Hey ! Hey . You had no right to bring her here ! Not here . Okay . This was Christie 's house ! The yelling upsets him . Me too . I needed to see you . Well , you 've seen me . Now get out . Your father is missing . Come on , Enchanters . Come and take a taste of Datak Tarr . Datak got one ! There , there . Well , that shouldn 't cause any unwanted attention . Will he be all right ? A little TLC , a little protoform , he 'll be fine . I think the female Omec has taken him . Oh , yeah ? Why would she do that ? Kindzi wants me to suffer before killing me . Maybe you shouldn 't have had sex with her father . Please . Please do not attack me . Not right now . Oh , I 'm sorry . That was great . Great show . Did you practice in front of a mirror ? Stop it ! It occurs to me , Mother , that if the Omec really are trying to get to you through your family , well then you 've led them straight to my front door ! To Luke 's front door ! Did you not think of that ? You know , Pilar was right about you . You 're a classic narcissist . Andina ! Bring the baby ! You 're right . I was upset . I did not think clearly . We have to go somewhere safe . Somewhere she won 't think to look for us . Pack a bag . I 'll hurry Andina along . Damn fade So well behaved Better to be a princess than a bird in a cage What a load of bull ! Ha ! Mama 's gotta prove ... What 's the matter , Officer ? Was I speeding ? Step out of the roller , Doc . I 'm , uh , actually making a house call out to Freddy the Liberata 's place . Kind of in a rush here . Oh , yeah ? How is old Freddy these days ? He 's got a high fever , vomiting . Might be the Irath flu . Ah . Some of your patients have been going missing . Quite a few in a short span of time . I 've had a lot of no-shows lately . Might be some connection . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have a life to save . What was that ? What ? That . I want an explanation now . I value my patient 's privacy . Omec . What 's going on ? Why are you working with them ? I heal everybody , regardless of race , color , or creed . What about that poor woman in the field ? The one they were eating ? How were you helping to heal her ? Nolan , look . What is that ? - What 's on the back of your neck ? - That 's just a mole . I should ... I should really have that looked at . Ow ! Ow ! Ow , ow , ow , ow . That really ... That really hurts ! Ahhh ! Oh , thank God . What was that thing ? An Omec control stem . Give me that . Please , Amanda . Looks like Momma got her groove back . Was this your endgame ? What ? All this . What are you talking about ? Andina ! You showing up here , accidentally putting Luke and me in danger . I ... I wasn 't thinking . No , that 's not it . You 're always thinking . That 's what makes you so exhausting to deal with . Yes , Favi Stahma ? Put the baby in the roller . No , you know , stay put , Andina . My mother will be leaving alone . Alak . I didn 't get it at first , but now I do . See , you figured that we 'd have no choice but to go with you . As usual , you found a way to exploit a crisis and turn it into your own advantage . I would never intentionally put our family in danger . Our family is a fraud ! The fine clothes on your back , the plentiful food in your belly . There was nothing fraudulent about that , was there ? The record albums , your own car . You never wanted for anything . Petek Keev . Protek Keev . For God 's sake . In the name of family , you made me beat the living crap out of that kid . He was a despicable little runt . He was my friend . If we had not forced your hand , you would have been mocked . I was seven years old ! Old enough to uphold your liro ! Petek Keev was an innocent little kid ! With jekking asthma ! But because he was in the Yuke liro , I was supposed to knock his teeth out ? And when I finally did , when I couldn 't stop crying because of what you made me do to my friend , to my friends . You laughed at me . Your father laughed . I did not . Don 't blame Dad ! You control everything that happens in this family . At one time , yes . But I lost control of my life the day that you and Christie were kidnapped . Since then , the harder I fight to regain control , the less remains . I love you , my son . I want you to love me back , I want your respect . But I understand the nature of loss . Sometimes it is inevitable . I 'm sorry I came . It was never my intent to put my family in danger , but I understand why you would suspect the worst of me . Mom . Mom , I wanna believe you mean it but you never mean anything you say . Good bye . Love Mom , don 't . Just stop , okay ? Look it 's ... It 's dangerous out there . I will be fine . What should I do ? Should I ... Should I go after her ? Should I stop her ? That 's what she wants me to do . Do you want an honest opinion ? Yeah . Of course . Forget your mother . Think about Luke . He 's in danger if we stay here . No ! Please ! Let me go ! Ah ! Okay . Okay . Can we ... Can we just talk about this ? No . No . Okay . Dear God , if you are real , I 'm sorry that I didn 't believe in you . But I swear , I believe in you right now . I knew you 'd come . None of these are Kindzi . She 's still out there somewhere . With more on the way . You weren 't in control of your actions . So what ? People died . Because of me . I know the feeling . Now get over it and move on . We got a war to fight . Yours is the last bag to move , Favi . Thanks , Andina . I don 't ... I don 't know what I would 've done without you these past few weeks . You shame me . I 'm sworn to your family . I 'm yours always . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . It 's , um ... It 's too soon . No , the fault is mine , Favi . Alak . Just ... Just call me Alak . I 'm a patient person , Alak . I can wait . Your mother 's come back . Favi ? Run . Run . All right . Your turn . My father is dead because of you . He 's dead because you murdered him . Quiet , Casti whore ! Really ? What is that I hear ? Please . Please . No . No ! Nice try . No ! No ! Leave him alone ! No ! No . No . Ripped By mstoll

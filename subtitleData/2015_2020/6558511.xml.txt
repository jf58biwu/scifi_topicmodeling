 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha - Computers are going down . Power 's next . - How long do you think till the whole grid is dark ? - Soon . Very soon . - I can 't believe they did it . - We found a positive location . We 've got them . - Good . Get anyone you can over there now . - What do I tell them ? - As little as possible . Tell them ... someone opened the box ... - Dispatch , this is unit nine . We 've found them . Northeast corner of the building . SHADOWS ON THE WALL TWO WEEKS BEFORE ... - Hi . Hey . I 'm looking for a Chase Marshall . He 's about my height . Hey ... Chase ... I 'm looking for Chase , I 'm sorry . Uh , hi ... hi ... Chase Marshall ... Sorry , sorry ... whoa ... whoa . I 'm sorry ... sorry ... Uh ... - Palmer ? Palmer , is that you ? What are you doing here ? - I 'm asking myself the same question . I mean ... I know what I 'm doing here . Can we ... can we talk ? - We 're talking now . Why don 't you get a drink ? - A drink of what ? - Ah ... anything We 're at a bar , that 's what we do when we 're at bars . And it 's almost Christmas . So what 's not to drink about ? - Huh ? Are you ... you 're drunk ! - You 're drunk . - No , no I 'm not . Why are you drunk ? We have class tomorrow . - A. It 's nighttime , B. I 'm not gonna go , And C : You need to relax ; so let me get you a drink . Oh , sorry . Guys ... This is my roommate Palmer . and he 's ... uh ... himself ! - Hi , hey ... I 'm Palmer . Hi . Hi , hi . I 'm Palmer . Hello . Hi . I 'm Palmer . Hi ... Hi ... - How are you ? - Can we talk ? Someplace else ? - What are you doing , man ? She was talking to you . - Yeah , I know . Then I talked back . - You just said one word to her and then you blew her off your cell phone . - I ran out of options . - Options This isn 't a game of chess . - Yeah , I know . Chess is easier . - You really are something . - Chase , I need to talk to you . So , I 'm just gonna say it . Dear Chase , You are a good cousin , and I know we have been roommates for a while now , so I should have spoken sooner . Some of your lifestyle choices are tough for me . Always having people over makes me uncomfortable and makes it hard to do my work . Uh ... can we please do something about this while still remaining friends ? - You want me to stop having people over ? Why ? - Uh ... they intrude on my work and my space . Uh ... in one instance someone set a beer on my desk and even asked to use my computer for a minute . - Oh ... my ... God ! Has the U.N. heard of these ... these crimes against humanity ? Look , you don 't have to read to me . - I didn 't know what else to do . - So you want me to stop having people over to our room ? What 's the point in living in a dorm ? - Affordable housing ? - Meeting people ! Having fun ! No . This is good for you . One day you 'll thank me . Who knows ? You might even meet a girl this way if you quit hiding behind this . - Could you give me my phone back , please ? - If you start lightning up ... - No . You know what ? I can 't do this . I can 't . I 'm moving back over with my parents . - What ? Wait , seriously ? You can 't do what ? - This . I made up my mind . Right now . - Okay ... Forgive my saying but doesn 't that seem a bit passive aggressive ? - At least back there I could work . - Work ? Palmer , I thought you put all that stuff behind you . - I tried . It didn 't work . - I 'm worried about you , man . All that stuff is going nowhere . And I hate to say this , but ... you 're not going anywhere , too . And if you move back in with your mom , you 're gonna make it worse . Palmer , where are you going ? - We left everything just the way it was ... Nothing 's been moved . - Mostly . - Have you had dinner ? I can ... - I 'm fine ! I just wanna work . - Okay . - Hey ... Huh ... I am so sorry . - You 're so late . Don 't be late again . - Sorry . I lost track of time . - Yeah , don 't . I 'm really busy and I do not have time to waste on you . Now wait a minute ... No , I know you . You 're that kid from Engineering . You work in the lab , right ? - Uh , mostly . Uh ... I take care of the parts , manage the gear ... - You 're like a whiz in that class . What could you possibly need me for ? - Uh ... I 'm not such a whiz with math . - Oh , no ... I guess you 're not . Academic probation already ? Ouch ! - I don 't know what else to do . You know ? Every time I look at this stuff , my head starts to spin . If I can 't get my grades up , then I should just quit now . - Hey ! You are not quitting ! My honors points come from me helping you pass this class , so until then , you belong to me . Got it ? What is this ? - Please don 't ... okay don 't ... uh ... - Did ... you made all this ? - Yeah . Please don 't laugh . - I mean did you like make them make them ? - Mostly . - Huh . That 's really cool . - You think so ? - Yeah . Have you ever like sold one of your designs ? - Oh ... not necessarily . - Okay . So ... What is it that you do then ? - Well , nothing now . My family won 't let me . - Your family won 't let you ? What are you ? Eight ? Since when do you care what they want ? Now ... let 's start with last week 's assignment . And pay attention because we 've got a lot that we 're gonna cover . This is a D , Palmer ! That is bad . - Well , at least it 's not an F. - Well , it might as well be . You have got one more test to fix your grade and you 're just sitting here daydreaming ! Listen carefully . You are making me look bad and nobody makes me look bad but me . I can do that fine on my own , thank you . Now , if you fail that exam , that makes me look bad . Are we on the same page here ? Okay ... let 's call it a night . And rest up because tomorrow we 're going over ever answer you missed and then we 're gonna retake that test again in front of me until you get it right . Got it ? Resting up , huh ? You sleep through study and then you scurry away as soon as I let you go . Did you really think I wouldn 't notice , Palmer ? - I can explain . - Good . I hope so . Because it seems as if you 've been wasting my time to go run off to play ... What is this ? - I 'm sorry , alright ? I didn 't know where else to go . They told me I couldn 't keep working , but I had to and then I didn 't know where and then you suggested ... - Whoa . Where did you get the money for a setup like this ? - I didn 't . - Wait ... you 're squatting here ? - You told me to get out of the house ! Well , I didn 't know where else to go , okay ? Please don 't tell anyone . - I won 't tell . So where did you get all of this ? - Here and there . You know . Just been collecting it over the years . - Years ? - Yeah , just ... you know . Just been doing this since I was about twelve . - Oh , twelve. wow . I could barely ride a bike when I was twelve . - Well , I 'm not that good at it , but but this one is uh ... this is different . This is the one . - " The one " ? What do you mean ? like the first one to go big ? Get bought up ? - Uh ... first one to ... work . - Wait ... what ? - Oh , wait a minute . You mean none of these actually work ? - Well , this one will . I 'm sure of it . - What is it ? - Well , it ... it 's like a radio but it doesn 't require any kind of signal . - Uh-huh ... - It uses the background radiation that 's all around us as a signal instead of having to broadcast one . We wouldn 't need towers or ... or receptors or anything it would just ... work . - And you came up with this all on your own ? - Yeah , kinda . I mean ... I think of things . You know ? Can 't help it . Can 't stop it , either . It 's ... it 's what I do . I love it . - Aren 't you almost done ? - Not exactly . This one involves a lot of math . You know how good I am with that . - Good is one way to put it . - Well , if this works , it could help people stay in touch wherever they are . - Palmer , you don 't really seem like the kind of person who wants to be in touch . - Look , I know I 'm not really good at anything , I understand that . If below average people can 't do above average things ... I have to try . Only ... um ... - Only you need help ? I should ... go . - Wait ! What if you did help me ? - I don 't know ... - No , no ... this would be perfect . I ... I 'll handle everything else , you just handle the math . - I 'm really busy . - Helping me with math ? - This is different ... - Wait ... wait . Did you ever hear the story of the scorpion and the fox ? - What ? - When you were a kid , no one told you that story ? Well , it 's a story . Um ... a scorpion and a fox are are ... trying to cross a river . And ... uh ... the scorpion asks the fox to to carry it across , and the fox says " No way , you 'll freacking sting me . " And the scorpion says " Well , I won 't sting you . If I do that , then we 'll both drown . " So the fox carries the scorpion and then halfway across the scorpion stings the fox . And as they are both drowning , the fox asks the scorpion you know ... " Why did you do it ? " and the scorpion says " Well , I 'm a scorpion . It 's what I do . " - So you 're saying ... you wanna cross a river ? - Alright , look ... it 's a dumb story but the point is people do what they are . You know ? And all of this , this is what I am . This is what I do . If we can 't be who we are then what 's the point ? Of anything ? Plus , if you help me , I promise I 'll bring my grades up . And those honor points ? Look , if I can 't be me , I don 't know what I 'd be . Please help . - I ... Fine ! - Oh , yes ! - Only ... only for as long as you stay passing your class . Do you understand ? The minute you fall behind , I am gone . Got it ? Okay . When do we start ? - Now , the goal here is to connect the leads using as little material as possible . Or you run the risk of burning them out . Here we go . Check it out . - Are we finished ? - We 're out of parts . - We 're still not done ? Palmer ... Alright ... how much more do we need ? - Uh ... - But that 's so much . Are you sure ? - We can 't finish without them . - But where do we get them ? - Specialty suppliers . But I don 't have that kind of money . - Then where did you get all this ? Did you steal all this ? Palmer ... Have you been stealing this equipment from the school ? Great ! What are we gonna do now ? - What is this ? Some kind of joke ? I had to move in a new roommate . Because you couldn 't be normal . What do you want ? - Oh my god , I 've only got a minute ! - Okay . Alright , alright ... I 'm just a little uncomfortable . - Uncomfortable ? With what ? - Asking for money or being direct I don 't know . I 'm not really good at either . - Hurry up , Chase . - You 're asking me for money ? - No ... no . Yes . Partially . Parts . I need help getting parts . - You 're still doing that ... Look , I 'm not interested ... So go ask one of your other cousins . - My other cousins can 't help me . - Why should I help you ? - Because it 's cool . You 'll like it . - Look , goodbye , Palmer . - Come on ! Let 's play ! Goodbye Palmer . Please don 't call me unless it 's important . - This is important , Chase . To ... me ... anyway . Yeah , look ... Chase ... I know I 'm not very good at talking , alright ? But this would be a whole lot easier if you just see it . Please ? - No promises . - None . What do you think ? - I think you need a new hobby . - It 's not a hobby . - Will this one actually work ? - I think so . - Palmer ... uh ... This ... uh ... this is something , I 'll admit that , but we 're not kids anymore . We can 't just keep blowing my inheritance on all these stupid things and you ... you need to do something with yourself . Because this isn 't healthy . - So I have ... - Well , find something else , man . You can 't do this ! - Look , it wouldn 't take much . Alright ? Just a few more parts . That 's all I need . - Sorry ... I 'm sorry , Palmer . - please . - Oh , God . - Sorry I 'm late . So , that just happened . Thank you . - Hey ... what ? Yeah I know you . - Oh yeah . Econ , right ? - Uh ... yeah . You 're the one who 's always turning the test in first . Is it Charles ? - It 's ... uh ... Chase . - Chase ... that 's right . So you two are cousins ? I 'd never thought that . - Thank you ! - So , I think it 's really cool . What you 're doing . You know ... helping Palmer out . - Oh ! Yeah , well ... Yeah ... Yeah , well ... I wouldn 't say that I 'm helping . - Oh , well ... call it whatever you want . but that is really nice of you . So ... I got a couple of books in my car . - No one 's ever called me nice before . This is not a gift . - Not a gift ... uh-huh . We 're gonna make my money back . We are . - We are ? - When you 're done with this one , you 're not just gonna throw it on the pile like all the others . You 're gonna make sure that it works . You 'll know where to make money off of it , do you understand ? - We are ? - Or I 'm leaving . - Right now ! We are . - We are . - Wait ... night vision goggles ? We need night vision goggles ? - It 's a part of it . - What for ? - You 'd be surprised if the stuff would happen to be under perception . This will help narrow it to something we can work with . - You 're so weird . All that ... for that ? - What 's that ? - Open it and see . - National Science Board ... . I don 't get it . - It 's probably the nicest thing I 've ever done . - No way ! Chase , no way ! - Winners get a lunch with the R and D heads of several of the country 's biggest tech firms on top of the prize money ! Yeah , you can buy a lot of parts with that . - Palmer , this could actually be really good for you , I mean think of all the attention that you 're gonna get . - Whoa ! I just want to work ; I don 't want attention ! - I 'd hate to break it to you , Palmer , but this is how the world works . You agreed to this money on my terms . And I say ... this is how we 're gonna make it back . That 's final . Do we agree ? - We agree . - Now , the goal here is to get it hold a proper charge . You see , for us to build enough power , it has to build a current , then kick it into gear . - Like a flash bomb ? - Exactly . But with way more power . And more danger . - Shouldn 't we be wearing gloves , or something ? - Yeah , that 's a good idea . Now ... to prime the power , we flip this switch here , and then it will , well , it should , build a charge . Once the charge is full , this bulb will light up . - And then what ? - Then we press the button . - So what are we waiting for ? - Courage . - No , really ? - Damn . - No , what ... what does that mean ? - I don 't know . I guess the voltage was wrong . Unless your math was wrong . No , it 's probably me . Let 's ... let 's give it more power . - Another sunny day at Huntersville , North Carolina . With a perfect forecast for those of you coming for the holidays . - Off . - What ? I want to hear the news . - And I want to work . So turn it off . - That 's gonna go up on Facebook . I 'll have to leave it on . - Turn it off . End of discussion . - Alright , let 's leave it to a vote . Palmer ? What do you say , man ? - Well , I think you both presented very strong arguments . - Just vote , Palmer . - I abstain from voting . - Oh , if it 's tied , then I get the tie-breaking vote and I say aye . - Outbound traffic at interstate 26 So give yourself a little extra time and ... - Okay . - Alright , I 'll try even more . - Palmer , this thing is due in three days and won 't even turn on . What 's the deal ? - Theoretically , this could send any kind of data sound , information , maybe even energy , without ever using a signal . - That will never work . Look , it 's a cool idea , Palmer , you know ... but you 're just pulling it out of thin air . Look , I don 't mean to be a dick , but you are not that talented , so why don 't we stick to something that 's easy ? - I don 't want something easy . - God , this is so stupid ... - Ah ! Ah ! Woohooo ! Haha ! This should work like a Viewfinder . Just point it at the desired subject and it 'll dye the signal that goes out . - Like a camera ? - Yes , theoretically . - So what do we take a picture of ? No way ... - Nice work . - Careful , you 'll break it . - It 's already broken . - What 's wrong with it ? - I don 't know . - Here we go again . - Look , it 's the first device of its kind , ever . Okay ... literally ... there 's literally an infinity of things that can be wrong with it . - You should have listened to me . - Wait , wait ... go back where you were , you need to retake that one . Can you get that out of here ? This was your idea . I 'm just trying to help . The focus was off on that one . - What did you say ? - I said I need to retake that one unless you want to look like a ghost in it . You said the thing works like a camera . - What do you do with a camera ? - You focus it . - We can send the signal out but if it doesn 't know how far to send it it won 't know unless it 's focused . - How do you focus it ? - We make a model of the distance we 're aiming at . then we figure out how much power it would take and at what frequency to reach the given distance . - There should be a standard deviation we could find to say that " X " amount of power into the scope equals " Y " amount of focusing . - Can you do that ? I can 't do that . - Yes , I can do that . - Hey , I don 't have to remind you that we only have three days left . - It 's not exactly perfect , but using the system Alice made , this wheel will approximate how much energy 's applied to the device yielding a precise distance that it hits . - You mean it focuses it ? Are you sure ? So how far do you think that is ? - Uh , probably 400 feet ? No ... wait . - What ? - This is Palmer 's idea . Don 't you think that he should get the first shot ? - What is it ? - Uh , I don 't know . It 's some sort of noise or something . - No , that 's not noise . Look , that 's a door . That 's a tiny logo on the door . You just took a picture of the text at the door across the street . - It works ... Oh , my God it works . - Whoa , wait . Will it save the image ? - Well , I hooked it up to your laptop . Everything the device stores should be backed up there . - Alright , try another one . See if you can zoom in even further . - You know , it can actually zoom into any level of detail . - Okay ... well try it and see . - What happened ? I blew up the building . Oh my god , I blew up the building ! - Oh calm down , you didn 't blow up anything . It just looks like somebody turned the lights off . - Turned the lights off at the exact moment that I pointed an electromagnetic device in it ? Oh my God ... oh my God ... Oh my God . - Oh my gosh ... it works , it just has a little side effect , but Palmer , it works . - That is hardly a side effect . Oh , my God , I 'm in so much trouble . What are we gonna ... what if they trace the damage of the building back to me ? - Palmer , calm down . Calm down ! What are they gonna do ? Notice that the power 's out and deduce that Palmer , who 's been secretly working in an abandoned warehouse across the street must have designed a device that shot their power out or are they just gonna replace the fuse ? - they 're gonna replace the fuse . - Okay , so why does our device do that ? - Well , everything runs on magnetism . Power , computers , electronics ... When the device sends out a signal , it must interfere with that . - Oh , my God . If this was used like a weapon , it could shut down an entire city , couldn 't it ? - Please don 't word it that way or I 'm gonna freak out all over again . - Relax ... I just won 't point it at any electronics from now on . Alright ? Problem solved . - Where else are we gonna point it ? I mean , we 're surrounded by machines . - Oh , yeah ! Look at that ! - Oh my gosh ! Palmer ? What cable do you have for the viewfinder ? - Why ? - ' Cause I got an idea . Okay ... so ... it should be right around here . - That 's it ? - Yeah that 's it . That 's Mars . - It 's so small ... - Whoa ! - Oh ! - Zoom it in even further . Okay , zoom in more . A little bit more . - No , let 's be careful here . We - - Oh my gosh ! That is a picture of a rock that is eighty million miles away from us . - Holy ... damn . - Who should have listened to who ? - Wow , we got to turn this in right now . - No , we can 't turn this in . We barely know what it can do . - We made it . It works . What else is there to do ? - but we barely know how it works . it 's kind of embarrassing to go public with something that we barely understand . - It 's due in two days ! - We 're already pushing it ! I have to file all the papers for it , not to mention I have to mail them in . - Wait , you 're sending it in already ? - We need to do more tests . how are we supposed to explain it to people if we don 't even know it that well ? - Alice , we just took a picture of a rock that was how far ? - Eighty million miles away.Give or take . - We just took a picture of a rick that was eight million miles away . Was else is there to test ? - Why don 't we see how far it can shoot ? - Uh ... how do you plan to do that ? - Can you set the focus distance to infinity ? - Alice , I know that you 're more of a math person than I am . But I bet that with this kind of test we 're gonna need more power . - Explain . - Since we 're testing its range , we need to give it enough electricity so that power is not the limiting factor . But right now , we 're plugged into a standard wall outlet . - And ? - The main lines might get something more to pull from . - Lines ? Power lines ? No way ! We might get caught ! - You weren 't afraid to shoot at a streetlight the other night . - That was different . We could ... we could go to jail for that . - We have the opportunity of a lifetime here . You aren 't afraid to take it , are you ? - This is so dangerous . - It 'll be okay . - It 's your machine ; you get the honors . - Now , with this much juice we shouldn 't just start at full power . I say we start small and build our way to full power . Okay ... Please be careful . - Uh ... . What distance are we at ? - One million miles . Two million miles . Ten million miles . Fifty million miles . I think that 's one-hundred ... One-hundred million miles . Two-hundred million miles . - Everything looks good . - Ah ! Hey , can we make this go faster ? - Can you be quiet ? - I 'm just saying . - Alice , what if you set the distance to reflect light years instead of miles ? - And how far is that ? - Uh ... a light year is 5.8 trillion miles , give or take . - Give or take ? - Would you like to do this ? Are you ready , Palmer ? One light year . Two light years . Ten light years . One-hundred light years . Two-hundred light years ! Five-hundred light years ! - I 'm gonna narrow the focus , get more kick . - You see ? It 's not so bad . Okay ... One-thousand light years . Ten-thousand light years ! Twenty-thousand light years ! Fifty-thousand light years ! One-hundred thousand light years . - We 're now sending a data stream one million light years across the background noise of space ! - Palmer ! Palmer ! - Ice packs ! - Ten million light years . Twenty million light years . Fifty million . One-hundred million light years . - It 's still working ! - One billion light years ! - Turn it off ! That 's enough . - Don 't you want to know ? - Oh , so you 're in on this too , now , huh ? - It 's exciting ! - Two billion light years ! Three ... three billion light years ! Ten billion light years ! Palmer , we are now looking further than any telescope has seen before . - It 's beautiful ... . - Oh , Palmer , Palmer , help me ! - Thirty billion ! Fifty billion ! I think this is the edge of the visible universe . One-hundred billion light years ... . You wanna ... You wanna set it for beyond the edge . - Let 's do it ! - Come on , come on ... - I think ... I think we did something . - Oh ! Oh ! Way to go ! You just had to go and push it , huh ? - I 'm sorry . - Oh ! You 're sorry ! Okay , Hey , everyone , it 's okay , because Palmer 's sorry ! Alice , why don 't you go see how sorry the breakers are ? Jesus ! Can you fix it ? - I don 't even know . Let me ... see . - Guys ? The breakers look fried . Like ... expensive fried . - I told you . I told you . I told you ! Oh my God , I told you this was a bad idea . - Chase , will you please calm down ? - Calm down ? This project is due tomorrow and all we have left is this this expensive , ruined piece of garbage ! - Hey , we may still be able to fix it , okay ? Look , I can 't tell when it 's overheated , but it may be just the power that blew , The device might still work ! - Do you really think that 's true ? - Anything 's possible . I 'm sorry . I just wanted to see . - What about all the damage done to the building ? Huh ? The breakers are fried ! This place ... reeks of smoke ! They 're gonna find out that we were here and have lost all that money ! - Chase ? - What ? ! - I 'm sorry . - Palmer ? We should go . - I think I found the problem . There was a burnout on the lines in the morning . - More than one ? Are you well ? Is that place vacant ? - Checked upstairs . Just a bunch of junk . Could have been a lightning strike , maybe maxed in the transformers , looks like an old board . It wouldn 't have taken much . - Specialized with a new board . Just know the ? - Copy that . - Oh my God ! - Don 't look in there . You 'll give us away . - I just wanna see . - Should we go back in ? - Then what ? Explain to them we 've been trespassing ? Building machines with stolen parts and set their building on fire ? You know what , Palmer ? Your ideas were a probation , man . - Look , if they 're gonna find out sooner or later , we might as well get it over with right now . - Look , maybe we don 't have to . The machine 's cooked ... so all we have is the data ... maybe we can just send that in . We might still be able to get credit then we don 't have to deal with this landlord . - Just let it go ? What about my machine ? - The data is all that matters . - No ! I don 't want to give up ! I don 't ! We came this far . You guys ... It would be stupid to turn in a half finished project . - It 's not stupid . It 's careful . - No ! - Look ... The rules say that it 's okay if by the time by the ... - What ? - What the hell ? What the hell ? Did one of you drop this ? - How could we ? You stormed off with it , remember ? - A drop wouldn 't cause this . - Did you charge the battery , Chase ? - battery wouldn 't cause this either . It 's definitely electrical interference but I 've never seen anything like it . It 's running slow , too . - I swear to God , if you broke my computer ... - It 's not us , okay ? It 's got to be outside interference . Oh my God . Do you think we did this ? - No , we blew a circuit breaker , we didn 't fry a whole power grid . - But what if we did ? - Palmer ... - I mean , if we blew the grid , they 're gonna have to replace everything . - Palmer ... - yeah , they 're gonna come after us They 're gonna find us ... - Shut up ! Palmer , calm down ! We 'll figure this out . It will be fine . - Calm down ? Look what we 've done ! I have to fess up . - No , whoa ... you are not saying anything . We got to keep this under wraps . - Why ? So we get in more trouble ? - So that we can let this blow over and finish the contest ! Look , if we fess up , they are going to pin the power on the other building on us . And then this too . We got to keep a low profile . Look , the machine 's off . We don 't have to do any more work . We 're done . So in the meantime , maybe you can keep quiet and let me sort this out . Okay ? - Great ... - Hello ? - Hello , is this Chase ? Chase Marshall ? - Uh , yeah . - My name is Dolores . I 'm with the National Science Board . - Oh ... yeah ... Hi . - Hi . We 've reviewed your submission packet and there were a few details that caught our attention . We 'd very much like to see this device and I 've arranged for travel . Can you meet this afternoon ? - I 'm afraid it 's unavailable at the moment . - We 'd very much like to meet ... Can we drop by you house ? You 're still at 25 Canuca , right ? - I 'm actually ... I 'm afraid I 'm at work . How about Downtown ? There 's a little ... uh ... coffee shop we can meet at on Main Street . - I can do that . Still it 's very important that we be shown the device . Do you understand ? Mr. Marshall ? - Of course . Sure . Let 's just ... uh ... meet there and uh ... we 'll chat about it and we 'll go from there ? I vote a little coffee house ... Main . Uh ... two o 'clock cool ? - Two o 'clock . Don 't be late . - I don 't care if your system 's down I just need to go . - I 'm really sorry sir , just give me a second . Larry , can you come over here ? - Stupid computer ... Stupid piece of ... Hello ? Hello ? Can you hear me ? Come in ! Hello ? Hold on , let me try finding a different one . - Help ! - Oh God ! - It 's still here ! - Well , can you salvage it ? - I 'm not sure . That can 't be right . - What 's the matter ? - The control 's not responding . We 're completely locked out . - What would cause that ? Can it still send its signal out ? - No . Wait ... It 's not sending a signal ... It 's receiving one . - And what does that mean ? - I don 't know . It 's not supposed to do that . I 'm turning it off . - No , wait ! If you just ... shut if off , won 't it damage all the computers it 's controlling ? What should we do ? - Palmer ... . What is going on ? - I don 't know . I ... there 's so many options , Interference . Overload ... What have I done ? Wish I hadn 't done this . I 'm in so much trouble . - Palmer ? Any ideas ? - I have no ideas . I have never seen anything like this before ! It 's all just guesses . - Alright . Take a deep breath and just guess . - The buffer 's full . Whatever this is receiving has totally filled it up . It 's possible that the incoming data has filled it up so much that it 's filling other devices , like the computers around town . - Can we get this in English , please ? - Whatever this is receiving has filled it out so much it 's overflowing into other computers . - So how can we stop it ? - Storage space . We give the device more storage space ! Memory ! Drives ! - How long will this hold ? - I don 't know , a few hours I guess . This doesn 't make any sense ! I don 't understand ! This can 't be happening ! This is the only device like this in the world ! It 's impossible it can be receiving a signal ! - Well , there has to be some sort of explanation for it . Where was the last place you aimed it ? - About a hundred billion light years away from here . - No , that 's impossible . - Why is that impossible ? - Because that is beyond the edge of the visible universe . So that 's where the signal is coming from ? - No ! Well , yes , but no . I mean it can 't be , nothing can go that fast . Not even light can travel that fast . - But this thing doesn 't use light . This runs on radiation that 's all around us . It 's all around the universe ! What have I done ? - Whoa ... whoa ... hold on . Hold on . Are you saying that we reached across space and something on the other side of the universe is reaching back ? - No , guys ... Look . Listen . I hate to sound like a broken record here , but that 's not possible ! Nothing can go that fast and there is no way you could have done that . - Do you have any better ideas ? because if you do , I 'd really like to hear them right now . Please have a better idea . - Palmer ... uh , Palmer ... . Whoa ... - The hard drives are filled up ! - Already ? Already ? You said that would take hours . - I know ! I don 't know ! I ... What have I done ? - Okay , Palmer just look . What could we been missing here ? - If it runs on radiation it puts out radiation . If we can see that , then we could understand it better . - Alright , so how do we see that ? - We can 't ! Maybe we can see its effects . Chase , can I see your camera ? Why ? the colored glass you have with it ... the ... the ... Filters ? Yeah , the filters . Maybe they can show us something we haven 't seen before . Take a picture . - Whoa ! What the hell was that ? - I don 't know ... I bet no good will come from it . - Uh-huh . It 's growing . - What ? - Jesus ... Christ ... . - Hey guys ? You should hear this . - More reports coming in from all over town Computers , networks being hijacked by some kind of control , No one seems to know the cause , but some sort of virus or attack cannot be ruled out . - Whoa , what happens if you do that ? - It 's gotta be better than this . - We 're getting a live call now from one of our listeners . Marsha , can you hear me ? - Yeah I hear ya . - Tell us what happened . City hall put up signs saying to tell them if machines were acting up . I called then and not five minutes later some men in suits was at my door asking to see it . I showed them my office and they just looked over everything . - Then what happened , Marsha ? - Then I said ' What are you doing ? ' That 's mine . And they just they was taking it that it was giving them evidence . - Cops ? Evidence ? - Quiet . - So let me get this straight . You called City hall when your computer was acting up Someone came to your house and took your computer They didn 't fix it or even try to ? - They didn 't fix nothing . They just said was theirs and took it . - With no explanation ? - No , I tried calling city Hall ... - Marsha , if you excuse me we 've got a call coming in very urgent I 'm getting word now that interstate 26 going out of town has been shut down and drivers have been sent back to their homes . No word about the cause yet , but this sounds like a quarantine if ever I 'd seen one . Does anyone else have any stories out there ? - Oh ... shit . - I can 't do this . - UH ... guys ... . it 's ... uh ... still on . - Why 's it doing that ? - Did one of you turn it back on ? The receiving rate 's picked up ! Whoever is sending us data is now powering the scope ! - But how is that possible ? - For us it isn 't ! - Okay , what do we do now ? - Uh , let 's just think about this objectively . - Okay , think objectively . - Okay ... Each time the speed increases , the amount of power that 's coming into the device decreases by ... half . And the more data it receives , the closer it gets to cutting off . - So you 're saying it 'll run out ? - No , I mean ... maybe it 's building up to something . A countdown . - And then what ? - Then I don 't know , I mean ... if you were trying to contact someone who 's reached out to you , what would you send them ? - A message . - Or a messenger . - What I 'm hearing is there is supposed to be three young adult students competing in some kind of contest . Authorities say they may be the cause of these disturbances and must be located immediately . If you 're listening to this , please turn yourselves in . A slap on the wrist is much better than continuing this prank . - A prank ? God , they don 't have a clue ! - Turn ourselves in ? Maybe they 're right . - It 's them . - Them ? Them who ? - It 's the Science Board . - Wait , you 've been talking to them ? - It 's complicated . - Don 't answer it ! - Hello ? - Mr . Marshall ? You missed our meeting . - I was ... uh ... I was busy . - Yes , I say you were . Where are you , Mr. Marshall ? - Where am I ? - Chase ? Hang ... up We need to see you and this device immediately . - Why ? - You know why . - Hang up , Chase ! - Who is that with you ? - Nobody . - Mr . Marshall , I don 't know what you think you 've gotten yourself into , but this has become a government situation that must be handled by the government . - What ? You told them ? I thought we were keeping this a secret ! - I thought it was broken ! Look , this is our device . Will you ... are you gonna take it away from us ? - We 'll need to study the device , yes . To determine its capabilities and see if it poses a threat . A threat ? ! You have no authority to operate something like that . Turn it over to us now when you still have the option to . - You wanna take it ? ! - You 're in over your head , Mr. Marshall . More than you know . - I think she 's right . We should just hand it to them . - And who is she ? Did you even know ? What , you 're just gonna trust them ? - What about my machine ? - I say we keep it . - What ? - Yeah , it 's our machine ; we built it . You 're just gonna hand it over to them ? - Wait a minute . We 're not qualified for this . - Oh , and they are ? - Someone could get hurt . What are you , crazy ? I knew he was , but you ? - Palmer ... Now that the device is hooked up , do you think that maybe we could connect it to a cellphone like we tried ? - I guess ... if .. I have an even number to use . - How about this one ? - Is this legal ? - Are you actually worried about being legal at this point ? - We have a problem . - Were you able to get a location from them ? - I was not . How should we proceed ? - Based on the schematics they submitted to that contest , I think they 've gotten much further than most people . Including us . - Well , we 've closed the interstates . They can 't make it out of town without us catching them . We 'll get it . - I don 't think they 're running . I bet they 're hiding somewhere . - Do you think they 'd made contact ? - It seems obvious at this point . - Shit ! Homeland Security is gonna have a fit ! - Look , I can handle Homeland . For now , our top priority remains securing the device . - Since it 's been on this long , do you think Do you think they 'll have an encounter ? - I do . - When ? - Tonight , most likely . - With one man ... or ... ? - That depends on how far they reached . What was that ? - It wasn 't me . - Don 't use this number anymore . - I wanna go home ... - No , we can 't go home , Palmer . Not now . - Then what ? - We have to find a way to stop this . - So , if we can 't cut the power , maybe there 's a way that we can block the signal that 's coming in ? - If this thing can cut across space in an instant , there 's probably not much that can get in its way . Do you really think that we 're being contacted ? That someone 's coming ? - I suppose anything 's possible . - Why now ? I mean why us ? - There are like ... a thousand possible answers to that question . But I guess they all fall into two categories . One ... they 've always been calling and we just haven 't been listening . - Or ? - Two ... We simply haven 't gotten to the phone in time . - Which do you think is happening ? - Both ? Palmer ! Palmer . I 'm sorry , I ... I didn 't mean to scare you . If ... if we 're gonna get through this , we just need to stay calm and we need to think , okay ? How can we stop it ? - This thing is running on instant data transmission . It 's unlikely that they 'll arrive in like ... flying saucers or something . All the data is being received through the device , so it 's likely they 'll end up somewhere near it . Like here . - But what will happen ? What was that ? - Something just killed the power . - Guys ? - I 'm here . - Palmer ? - Here . Come over here . - What happened ? - It 's off . - What do you mean , it 's off ? - I mean it 's off . I don 't know . You tell me . - What ? You hear that ? I just ... I just heard something . Over there . - Why are they doing that ? Oh , Palmer , it killed the power earlier . Someone 's gonna cut it back on . - You 're closest . - Palmer , stay here . Got it ? - What was that ? - I think they 're here . - I can 't see anything ! - Did she ... did she just leave us ? - Do you see anything ? Shh ... quietly . Stars . This is beautiful . - What is that ? - Maybe this is where it 's coming from . - ? - I think we 're just seeing ... our reflection . Like a shadow . Palmer ! What is this ? - I saw something . Barely . - Where ? Hurry up , Chase ! Come on , Chase . - What happened ? - It Sp ... it spoke to me . - What ? What did it say ? - I don 't know ! All I could make out was the emotion ... it was one emotion ... they were trying to warn us . - Where is ... where 's my what ? ? - I don 't know ! We 're gonna need a better way to communicate . - Hey , hey ... Maybe this is a stupid idea . Can you hook the goggles up to the device ? And use them for the viewfinder ? - That 's a really good idea . - I 'd be careful ! - Palmer ! What are you doing , Palmer ? - I ... I 'm trying ! Got it . - Uh ... it is your device . This is yours . - Okay . - What do you see ? - Palmer ? Palmer ! Palmer ? - Oh , my God ! - What happened ? - He ... he saw them . Is he gonna be okay ? - Saw them ? How ? - Red , the color red . - Hand it over ! Quickly ! - Ah ! Okay , what 's going on ? - You 're being drawn to the machine . Get some light in here ! - Ah ! Ah ! - Ah ! - Get that thing turned off ! - I can 't ! - Why not ? - Because it 's disappearing . - We need this place wrecked . Now . - No , wait , wait , look ! I think it 's still here , but ... but it 's not . - It is still here . - How ? - It is possible that when your visitors touched the device , they knocked it out of our space into theirs . At least partially . - Oh ... - Oh , that 's not all . Your laptop is still receiving data , and lots of it . - No , no ... they left , how are we still receiving data ? - They 're not the only ones trying to contact you . - Are you hearing this ? Are you all hearing this ? We 're not even sure if anyone can hear us anymore ... We 're broadcasting in the hope that somebody does . Lights , lights in the sky . All sizes ... huge ! Calls coming in from everywhere , and some ... some ? unfolding in the skies . And it 's sitting at its center . - Palmer ... - I 'm here . I can see them . They 're all around us . They 're ... talking . They 're warning me . - You shouldn 't be here ; this is a classified situation ! - We 're staying . - Ma 'am ... I have to recommend calming this down . You have no idea what you 've gotten into . Everything here is evidence . Now clear out . - Wait ... My friends stay . - You said they 're warning you . What did they warn you about ? - These ... visitors . They 're just the first of many , many things being drawn to the machine . It 's like a beacon to them . - More ? Are they here now ? - Not in this room . No . Somewhere up in the sky . More are coming . - These first ones to arrive What are they warning you about ? - Some of these new ones are much less friendly then they are . - Palmer ... . If the device is like I 'm thinking , ? what would happen if they Our guests ... if they took it with them ? - Could it draw the others away from here ? - Yes . - Can you ask them ? - They tried to , except when we turned it on , we became like an antenna for it . We 're ... . tied to it . Radiating its signal . - Who turned it on ? - Oh , we did . It was the three of us . - They say they can take it away . But only if one of us goes through with them . - No , no , no ... wait . You ... you can 't . Hey wait ! You 've got to help us ! Please don 't ! You gotta do something ! - I 'll go . I volunteer . - They say it has to be one of us . - No . - No , we 'll find another way ... We 'll figure something out ! What is that sound ! - More of them ... - Shot fired ... repeat shot fired . Getting one from multiple forces , We 're being told some sort of disturbance has happened over the Atlantic . Lives have been lost ... A passenger jet has ? over the ocean ... I don 't know what 's happened here . Your guess is as good as mine . Fighters scramble to engage ? over the east coast . - I 'll do it . - What ? - I 'll do it . - I 'll go . - Palmer ... Hey , you don 't have to do this . This isn 't your fault . Listen to me . - Listen to me ... This is my work . I did this . It 's my decision . I want to . - No Palmer . - You don 't understand . This is going to get ugly . Somebody has to go . You two belong here . I 'll go . Palmer ! Palmer ! - Palmer ! - I can do this . I can do this . Thank you . - Palmer , wait ! - Goodbye . - Palmer ... - This is not telling you they are leaving up and down the coast . reported a light banded together and leaving , just as fast as they got here , like the bat out of hell ! they all sniggled up and shipped away Every single one of them in the same direction It was like they were chasing something . As I have more information , I will report it to you as soon as it comes in . - Directors are willing to offer full pardons for damages and trespassing . In exchange for NDRs signed by both of you . Not a word of this get out , do you understand ? - What about the story ? - What about everything ? What about ... Palmer ? - Official statement will be released soon . It 's out of our hands now . Higher power is not our work here . You made the right choice . - Is he really gone ? - Your guess is as good as mine . - What are we gonna tell people ? His parents ? - We signed those papers . We can 't say anything . - You know they 'll bury it . Him . His story . Everything he did . Just ... lost . - Maybe . Maybe not . - We signed their papers . We 've already admitted that anything released is a lie . - Not if you have proof . - What proof ? They took everything . - Not everything . Palmer always said everything was possible . The end

 LEDA will be dismantled for its assets . Sarah and her self-aware sisters won 't get such humane treatment . Alison is Sarah 's twin sister . Your ball hearing 's not going to be until Monday . - Monday ? - Mmm-hmm . - DOCTOR : Shingles . - Yes . You 'll be the first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . - A swan ? - Stop saying it like that . It was a vision of a swan . What is happening to me ? - This is from my ma . - No , no , no , no ! What if we created a blastocyst ? We 'd need fertilizable LEDA eggs . And castor sperm from Ira . Where are you going to get the eggs from ? The only problem is we don 't have the resources to do it ... Alone . I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you as the head of Neolution . Are you sure you can work with Sarah ? I look forward to it . I just want you to find a cure . We will . - ( RACHEL BREATHING HEAVILY ) - Rachel ? I saw it again . ( SIGHS ) The same man . - I think I was on the island . - Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . - It 's fine . - You need to see this . Turn it up . EVIE : When the refinery shut down , my father lost his job , just like a lot of folks in Tisdale . You had a serious illness too , didn 't you ? Severe combined immunodeficiency ? EVIE : That 's right . We couldn 't move . Instead , it was a steady stream of of goodbyes , friends , teachers ... That must have been difficult . I got through it . But , as you know , Tisdale is still suffering . So when Brightborn decided to build a new research facility , I knew just the place . INTERVIEWER : Two hundred and sixty new jobs , a new walk-in clinic ... { CHUCKLES She 's painting herself as some kind of hometown hero . Yeah , she 's ingenious . I believe Tisdale can rebuild . And here at Brightborn , we just want to be a part of that . Right , so it 's press conference day today . Give me something . What are you going to say ? It 's just another big step for Brightborn . - You 'll just have to wait and see . - ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) You can probably give me one thing ? just one little ... - just give me one thing . - ( EVIE LAUGHS ) Her government approvals have come through . ( SIGHS ) - Then we should act now . - ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) That 's them . Are you sure you 're all right ? Scarcely believed it . A CASTOR who favors slacks . - You must be Felix . - Hello , Rachel . - Thank you for coming , Felix . - ( DOOR CLOSES ) This is a bad idea . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DEER FALLS ) GIRL : Mom , Mom , slow down ! I think I saw a deer . - Where ? - Do you see something ? WOMAN : Oh , I think I see it . GIRL : Morn , look , look ! GIRL : Oh , my gosh . - Mom ! Oh , my gosh ! - BOY : Mom , it 's a Sasquatch ! MAN : No , it 's just a girl . GIRL : Oh , my gosh , she killed a deer ! BOY : Oh , Mommy ! Mom ! Oh ! GIRL : Mom , she killed a deer ! WOMAN : Away from the window . Away from the window . ( INDISTINCT CLAMORING ) WOMAN : Drive the damn car . MAN : Oh , jeez . ( HELENA HUMMING ) ( GRUNTS ) I 'm sure we can all agree that this little diplomatic exchange is rock bottom . Susan gets the brilliant and delightful Cosima forging ahead to save your lives , while we get you , Rachel , and your half-baked plan to take down Evie Cho . I can assure you , it is not half-baked ... Ira , you fertilized my sister 's eggs for science . - You don 't get to speak , too . - SARAH : So what does it mean , then ? Evie 's got approval for clinical trials of the new bot ? It means implanted gene therapy works . They 'll prove it suppresses certain genetic disorders , only it 's a Trojan horse . 'Cause they can alter their DNA however they want . Yes , including germline editing . Changing their clients ' children 's DNA without consent . She wants to get the technology to the public within three years . Jesus . Evie Cho might be a more cunning villain than you , Rachel . Her villainy is exactly how we get her . Go on . IRA : Evie developed her tech with illegal human trials . We 've learned that two carriers recently fled the Brightborn maternity lab . Tabitha Stewart and Kendra Dupree . You want to find them before Evie does ? No , we want you to . With what these girls know , - I can destroy Evie . - SARAH : Right . And then Susan Duncan can take her place at the head of Neolution again . Evie is hunting you , Sarah . We both need her gone . 1 have ... ( STAMMERS ) Mmm . My limitations , but Ira will help . We do this , it 's with our people , our way . Give me the file . We 'll let you know how it goes . ( BABY WAILING ) DOCTOR : Okay . - She 's gone . - EVIE : Oh , no . DR. VAN LIER : I 'm sorry . It came for you this morning . " Leave us alone , or the whole video goes online . " Like I 'm going to let that happen . They could ruin everything . - Why haven 't we found them ? - We are working on it . Traced the email to a fixed address , but the less you know about that , the better . And what should I know about Detective Duko ? He disappeared tailing Sarah . Evie , you need to focus on the press conference tonight . Let us handle this . I have jobs for each of you . - Honey ! - Oh , Donnie , thank God ! Oh , my God , it is so good to see you . Oh , Donnie ! Donnie , please . I just ... I never thought I 'd see you again . - Let 's just go home ... - Contain yourself . Adele is coming over to talk about your defense , okay ? Well , she can wait ! Daddy needs his conjugal , baby . Donnie , our lives are imploding and all you can think about is your stiffy ? You 're right . I 'm sorry . You 've been such a rock . How are the kids doing in Florida ? Oh , they 're safe , except for my mother . Yeah ? What about you ? How 's the musical ? It 's a fraud . We 're singing Jesus Christ Superstar , and I 've completely lost touch with my faith . - No , you haven 't . - Yes , I have ! I 'm Judas , and I can 't even pray anymore . - Well , listen . - Oh ! Donnie ! Oh . Come on . Let 's just go home , all right ? We will let Adele get us out of this first , and then I 'll make you see God , Ms. Hendrix . - Donnie ! - Mmm-hmm . ( CHUCKLES ) - Here , hold my undies . - Oh , God ! - They 're dirty ! - Are they ... Kendra and Tabitha were both full term . Kendra 's got a four-year-old son . - All right , you 're a single mom ... - ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) and desperate enough to surrogate a monster for money . - How far can you run ? - ART : Yeah ... Tender mercies , Donnie 's out of remand . ( SOFTLY ) God . Hendrix is on bail , Cosima 's on the Island of Dr. Moreau and Helena is AWOL . I 'm meant to be bringing us together , and we 're falling apart . ( SIGHS ) - Well , at least you still got Rachel . - Oh , God , yeah . All right , I gotta go . I gotta go make sure the Hendrixes don 't let my bio-sister into Clone Club . - Love you . - I know . You , too . - ( DOOR SLIDING ) - You got something ? Uh , maybe . Description matches two women checked into the Centertown Shelter yesterday . One pregnant , the other with a newborn . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) SUSAN : Good . Now prick the oocyte right in the center to avoid trauma . I don 't want to screw this up . Relax . You 're merely fertilizing LEDA with CASTOR . ( COSIMA CHUCKLES ) Good . Now draw up some plasma so we know the membrane is ruptured and drop it back in the center . And we are on our way to compatible stern cells , thanks to Sarah and Ira 's contributions . ( SIGHS ) You all right ? Yeah , I think the trip up here yesterday took it out of me a little . I will put our egg in a culture . Why don 't you lie down for a bit ? Mmm . I have brought you some reading . No way . It 's very rare . " On the Science of Neolution . " P.T. Westmorland . " SARAH : Oh , no . ART : Yeah ... Centertown Women 's Shelter . This doesn 't look good . Shit . No , no , no . You stay right here . You 're not Beth Childs today . All right , fine . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) I ... I just talked to her . It doesn 't make any sense . She told me to meet her here . No , I 'm hearing you . But you have to let us do our job now . I saw cruisers . What 's going on ? In here . Looks like we have a suicide . So no signs of foul play ? No , not that I can see . Forensics is on the way . Though she checked in with a girl named Kendra , but now we can 't find her . ( CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ) - ( SOFTLY ) Jesus . - Yeah . Her other friend out there found her hanging from that pipe . No vital signs for her or the baby . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Oh , shit . Helena ! HELENA : Hello , sestra . ( STAMMERS ) Hey , we 've been worried about you . Why haven 't you answered your clone phone ? I think ringing is broken . Okay , where are you ? I have a place of my own now . How is Kira ? She 3 getting bigger . How about you ? How are yours ? Yes , much kicking . They 're fighting like us . - Yeah ? - ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm happy for you . Glad you 're far away from all this . Why ? Is problem ? No , no , no . - Is problem with family Hendrick ? - No , look ... It 's nothing for you to worry about . It 's just the usual shit . Oh , I 've gotta go . You keep those babies safe . All right ? Say yes . Okay . Okay . Bye , meathead . Er ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Trina ? Beth ! Why are you dressed like that ? Er , I 'm undercover . I 'm , ah , plainclothes . What 's wrong ? You were right about Brightborn . It 's way worse than I thought . These wounds look to be defensive . Could be . You seen Marty Duko lately ? - No , why ? - Guy blew his shift . Nobody knows where he is . No , I haven 't seen him . Hope he 's okay . TRINA : Tabitha called me as soon as they broke out . Scared shitless . It wasn 't a suicide . - No way . - I believe you . - But , uhm , what about Kendra Dupree ? - Oh , my God . I hope she got away . - Where would she go ? - I already told the detective in there . Okay , that 's good , but I ... ( STAMMERS ) Can you tell me ? I feel like I could help . Kendra talked about , ah , an empty house somewhere . ( SNIFFLES ) A friend of her family who died . Something Steinbeck . Clara ? Mary ? Any idea where ? I just know that the house wouldn 't sell , because the town 's economy is so crap . Tisdale ? That would make sense . Kendra 's from there . You gotta find her before they do . Yeah , okay . We will . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Detective . I 'm at the scene . The one that got away , Kendra Dupree , I got a little tip she 's headed to Tisdale . But you 're not the only ones looking for her . ( ADELE SIGHS ) Okay , could be worse . Er , they 've charged you with possession , trafficking and importing . Importing ? No , no , we weren 't importing . Shh . Er , what is their evidence ? Er , we won 't know for a couple of weeks . Until then , just comply with your bail conditions and try not to worry . - Okay - - Okay - FYI , there 's two plainclothes parked outside your house in an unmarked car . - We 're under surveillance ? - FELIX : Mmm-hmm . Is that normal ? We 've already been charged . Seems like Detective Duko has quite a hard-on for y 'all . ( STAMMERS ) It 's not him . Why couldn 't it be him ? 'Cause he 's on leave . Okay , how would you know if he 's on leave ? You know what ? Maybe we should review the scope of - lawyer-client privilege again . - Mmm . Okay , is something going on with Detective Duko ? ( SMACKS LIPS ) No . - No . - No , I don 't think there is . Great ! Uhm , we can continue this conversation at home . Let 's maybe have a drink there . - We 'll leave you two . - BOTH : Bye ! ( CHUCKLES ) It 's functioning perfectly , Evie . The therapy 's underway . - Well , I won 't miss the shingles . - ( CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) just promise me that you 'll find that carrier , Ian , - or none of it will matter . - I promise . ART : What do you know about this place ? SARAH : Tisdale ? Nothing . I mean , it looks rough . I 'm guessing Brightborn offered Kendra money and she thought , " How bad can it be ? " ART : Pretty bad . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) So , how many more Steinbecks we got left ? Er , two . And one Steinbeck . Rachel , I told you I 'd call you . Yes , an hour ago . Well , we 're still looking for Kendra Dupree . Well , we have new information that could help . Kendra took her four-year-old son William to friends in Pickering . I 'll send the address . No , we 've got our own leads out here . Where are you , then ? How can we help ? If I need help , I 'll ask . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) You really don 't like each other , do you ? She put a pencil in my brain . ( PROCESSING ) IRA : Okay . We have the location of Sarah 's last phone call . She 's in Tisdale . You should go , then . Contingency , in case she falters . You 're the sick one . Cosima . You 're the sick one , too , right ? Charlotte ? I don 't feel very sick yet . That 's good . How do you brush your hair ? I don 't . Just wake up and it looks like this . You wanna feel ? - I used to have pigtails , too . - Do you like the book ? Yep . But I 'm finding it a bit overwhelming right now . I didn 't even know that this guy , P.T. Westmorland , was involved in Neolution . This is my favorite part . COSIMA : Is this the island that we 're on ? CHARLOTTE : It 's made out of Precambrian rock , almost four billion years old . We 're at this end . You 're right . That is a very cool part . ADELE : First , your foster sister does a test on us , like she 's got geneticists at her disposal , and then I meet her suburbanite twin sister , the drug dealer . And her husband gets thrown in jail , and the cops just throw the book at him . Did your family threaten Duko or something ? Adele , you 're making it sound like we 're the mob . What ? So I 'm reading this wrong ? Well , you did just mix mood stabilizers with gin , darling . That 's brunch . Hello , Felix . FELIX : Hey , Helena ! Hi ! Adele , Helena . Helena , this is Adele . This is my half sister . What ? Different mother , same father . So you must be Sarah 's other sister . Yes . Same mother , womb . - So it 's triplets now , huh ? - Yeah . - Yeah , yeah . - From different regions . - From the same stomach . - FELIX : Yeah . Countries in there ? Different countries ? - This is ... I should go . - That 's probably best . Nonsense , I think you should stay . I have so many questions for ya . All starting with where you got that hat . Have you named it yet ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Can you use a different word ? - Just ... just call me a bad man . - Oh , you 're a bad man . - I 'm a bad man who runs this cell block ! - Oh , you run it . - I run this cell block ! - Yeah , you run it . Oh , honey , I love you . ( MOANING ) - ( ALISON PANTS ) - DONNIE : Oh . 'Oh ! ( SIGHS ) Donnie , would you pray with me , please ? - Right now ? - Yes , yes . ( SOFTLY ) just close your eyes . Close them . ( SIGHING ) Oh , dear Lord ... ( SIGHS ) I know we haven 't been very good Christians lately , but we are very grateful that Donnie 's out of remand , and we 're trying our best to be good ... To be good . Oh , crap . I 'm ... I can 't do this . Oh , God 's forsaken me . Honey ... ( STAMMERS ) I 'm sure he gets the point . No , no . Everybody knows we 're criminals . They stare at me in the grocery store . And there are cops outside of our house , Donnie . We have to get out of here . Honey , we can 't . I forfeited my passport as part of my bail conditions . ( SIGHS ) Well , we 'll ... We 'll go to Niagara , and we 'll pretend it 's a holiday . We 'll send for the kids , and we 'll go hide in one of those waterpark hotels . The last time we went to Splashdown , Oscar got foot and mouth disease . Donnie , would you work with me here , please ? Er , yeah . - Let 's go to Niagara . - Good . ART : All right , this is the last Steinbeck on the list . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) There 's baby stuff . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Just do it quick . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Hello ? Kendra ? ( BABY CRYING ) ART : Kendra Dupree ? ( BABY CONTINUES CRYING ) ( SOFTLY ) Hi . I won 't let you hurt my baby . ( BREATH TREMBLING ) Get away from him . ( BREATH TREMBLING ) Get away from him . We 're not from Brightborn . - We ... We don 't want to hurt your kid . - I don 't believe you . Listen very carefully . I 'm a police officer , I 'm going to reach into my pocket real slow and show you my ID . There you go . - All right ? Just put down the gun . - Move . Okay , okay - ( BABY CRYING ) ( SHUSHING ) ( SOFTLY ) It 's okay - It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . See , Felix neglected to tell me twice that Sarah 's got sisters . Oh , and you 're so preggo and foreign . Because it wasn 't pertinent and I 'm not a gossip . Oh , you 're not a gossip . ( SCOFFS ) Right . Where is Sarah ? She 's good . Good , darling . She 's just busy . Busy , busy . - Alison ? Donnie Hendrick ? - Yeah , they 're great . - All great . Totally fine . - Oh , yeah , they 're doing real well , aside from the fact that they 're currently under federal prosecution . FELIX : Adele ! ADELE : What ? Shouldn 't she know ? - They are sisters . - What does this mean ? Jail ? No , no . Well , maybe Donnie . Yes . I don 't know . Because of Pouchy ? So she knows about the killings ? ( LAUGHS ) Tangential , of course ... ( STAMMERS ) To drugs and missing cops . You have a loud voice . Yes , I do , because , see , my brother here , he 's got more secrets than a freemason , and I 'm getting real tired of sifting through all his bullshit . Maybe bullshit is where you belong . Did you just step up to me , little triplet ? ' ( SNARLS ) ' Jesus ! Okay , whoa ! No , you don 't want to do that , all right ? It 's okay . We don 't need to do any of that , all right ? All good . Uhm , sestra , you give me an hour here with Adele , and then I promise we are going to catch up right proper , okay ? ( HELENA SIGHS ) You are safe ? Yeah , hope so . ( DOOR SLIDING ) Wow . She was something else . ( SNIFFLES ) And I don 't think that hat was store-bought , neither . You 're gonna sober up , and then you 're gonna go . I 'm not leaving without an explanation . Adele , you are so beautifully unsullied by all this shit . And I 'm not going to be the person that ruins that for you . Okay , okay - ( SNIFFLES ) Genetics doesn 't really make a family , does it ? - No . - Honesty and ... ( SNIFFLES ) And , ah , acceptance ? That 's what it 's all about , hey ? ( SOFTLY ) This is my life . I 'm really sorry . Okay . Mmm . Okay . Uhm , I 'm gonna leave you with your real family for a while . ( ADELE SNIFFLES ) ( SOFTLY ) okay - ( BABY COOING ) - How did you find me ? - SARAH : We spoke to Trina . Uhm , I knew her from before . I was just coming back with lunch . They killed Tabitha , didn 't they ? Well , if they did , they made it look like a suicide . SARAH : We know about Brightborn . You want to tell us what happened ? - ( BABY CRIES ) - ( SHUSHING ) ( BABY COUGHING ) ( SOFTLY ) Shh . It 's okay . Tabitha and I were nearing full . Term . We heard rumors some of the babies were born ... Different . One night , the nurse fell asleep , so we snuck out of the ward . We heard a baby crying , saw two doctors sneak into an operating room ... ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) I 'd snuck this phone in to call my son . ( BABY CRYING ) ( SHUSHING ) DOCTOR : ( ON RECORDING ) See this dysplasia ? Must be excruciating . Hold her steady . ( BABY CONTINUES CRYING ) just a little bee sting , and then you won 't feel anything at all . ( BABY WAILING ) ( ECG MONITOR BEEPING ) okay - ( ECG MONITOR FLATLINES ) She 's gone . The next day we ran . I named him Jacob . They put this beautiful baby in me , but he was born blind . ( COOS ) If they find him , they 'll put him down , too . ( STAMMERS ) If you 're willing to come forward with this , we could expose them . We could end all this . Look , you take the video and you leave me out of it . That won 't work , Kendra . Without you , the video could be discounted . Look what they did to Tabitha . I have another son . They 'll hurt us . I know they will . ( SOFTLY ) Hi . So ? What do you think of Neolution 's forefather ? I think he 's fascinating , for a racist blowhard who thinks that poverty is genetic . ( SNIFFLES ) Consider the era , the Victorian mindset . Is your mindset so different ? ( CHUCKLES ) Our ethics debate again . Well , I just met a little girl with a deformed leg and a terminal illness . When I created Charlotte , I was under tremendous pressure to continue LEDA . I didn 't have Kendall 's replicating cell line . I don 't understand . What pressure ? It doesn 't matter . She is a life . She 's unique . She 's ... She 's happy - And , hopefully , we will cure her . ( SMACKS LIPS ) The cumulus cells are starting to strip off the egg . - ( CLEARS THROAT ) - That 's excellent news . Tomorrow , we should have a zygote ! Of course she 's reluctant to come forward . You have to convince her , Sarah . I 'm trying , but it 's not our decision , is it ? It 's hers . listen to me . If you found her , Brightborn is right behind . Tell her we 'll protect her . What if we can 't ? I 'm not lying to her . Then let me . Or use the information I gave you about her other son . ( SIGHS ) I 'm not blackmailing her , Rachel . ( SIGHS ) Oh , Sarah , don 't be naive . We have one chance at ... ( SIGHS ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Still here . - RACHEL : Sarah won 't act . We need that contingency plan . All right , but there 's a complication . - He 's sleeping . - SARAH : All right . We 're not safe here . We need , ah ... We need you to come with us . Like protective custody ? Honestly , there are police that we can 't trust . But we 've got a safe house , and it 's very well protected . This is crazy . I don 't even know you people . Brightborn is after us , too . And we both have daughters , and we put them first every day , just like you 're doing with Jacob . But we need you to help us end this . Could you go get him , please ? Okay . ART : ( SHUSHING SOFTLY ) Quiet . - They 're outside . - ( BABY WAILING ) ( KENDRA GASPS ) - Kendra ! - ART : Let her go , let her go . She 'll keep him quiet . - ( PHONE RINGING ) - Whose phone is that ? Landline . - Whoa . - Shit . - ( SHUSHING ) - ( PHONE CONTINUES RINGING ) - Hello ? - RACHEL : Kendra Dupree ? Listen to me carefully . I have an associate waiting for you in a car outside . I know Sarah is there . I also know your son , William , is with Carrie Munroe , 14 Emerson Drive , Pickering . If you do as I say , he won 't be hurt . ( SHUSHING ) - ( GUN COCKS ) - Don 't move ! Police ! Drop your weapons , nice and slow . Kick ' em over to me ! Get on your knees ! Put your hands behind your heads . Lock your fingers ! You again ? Where 's your usual partner ? Why ? Do you miss him ? You go get Kendra . I 'll take care of these guys . ( HANDCUFFS CLINKING ) Kendra ? ( ENGINE STARTING ) Ira , Stop ! Kendra ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ART : What happened ? She 's gone with Ira . Rachel 's screwing us . I 'm so stupid . Did you kill that woman at the shelter ? Hey ? Hey ? Oh , no , no ! Hey ! We 're not doing this . We 're going to drop them off at the precinct . We 'll be out by morning . - Yeah ? - ( SARAH SCOFFS ) Well , I 'll be real interested to see who springs you . Swimsuits , a hair dryer and earplugs for your snoring . Er , I grabbed some Imodium in case you want that crab salad again . ( SIGHS ) - Hey , the cops are gone . - Oh . There 's just an ambulance parked there now . - Good . Good time to skedaddle . - Yep . Let 's get out of here ... Wait ! Flip flops . - Er , basement . Basement . - Right . Okay , okay , okay . ( BANGING ) Donnie ? Donnie ? Donnie . Oh , Lord ! ( GASPS ) Sorry to barge in . We 're going to have a little chat . ( SOFTLY ) okay - Large-scale clinical trials are just the beginning . Soon , Brightborn will offer advanced gene therapy directly to you and your families . I can think of no better place to begin this genetic revolution than in my hometown of Tisdale . Thank you . Okay , I 'm ready . - What is it ? - Rachel Duncan is here . - In the city ? - Downstairs . She says she has information about Kendra Dupree . ( MUFFLED GRUNTING ) ( ALISON SIGHS ) You 're the tough one in the family , aren 't you ? I guess you 'd have to be . This one is first generation . It 's glitchy as hell . Messed up a lot of people . I need you to tell me what Sarah got up to with Detective Duko . He disappeared tracking her . By the time I count to ten , you 're going to answer , or this goes in . ( SOFTLY ) I love you , Donnie . - ( ALISON GASPING ) - One ... - Lord , please ... - two , three ... hear my prayer . I have sinned and sinned . - Four , five , six ... - I have turned my back on my community . I 've lost my way . - Please , forgive my husband . - seven , eight , nine ... ten . Protect my children ! And have mercy ... - ( CHOKING ) - ( GASPING ) ( SHUDDERING ) Helena . Where ... Where did you come from ? Beavertail National Park . It was very peaceful . ( PANTING ) ( MUFFLED ) Donnie Hendrick , you look like roast pig . ( MUFFLED MOANING ) Hey , what the hell are you up to ? - Where 's Kendra ? - She and her baby are safe . Did you threaten to hurt her kid ? Hey ? You 're worse than bloody Brightborn , mate . We 're just doing what needs to be done . What you would not . Where 's Rachel ? She 's meeting with Evie . You let her do that ? It 's not what you think . You 're stupid , mate . She is playing you . Rachel just wants power . She 'll cut us all down . Including you . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) You 're supposed to be on the island . Well , I 'm here . And lucky for you , I have your solution . You know where my carrier is ? She 's in my custody , along with her video . It 's abhorrent . I 'm surprised you left yourself so vulnerable . So this is a shakedown . I prefer to think of it as a negotiation . Project LEDA is obsolete . Off the table . - Fine . - Same as Susan . ( SIGHS ) Agreed . Her day has passed . ( SCOFFS ) Don 't tell me you want Sarah and her sisters spared . - You don 't know me at all , do you ? - Well , then what ? I take great offense to something you said to me once , that Neolution would never allow a clone a position of power . Today , that changes . You want a seat at the table . And in return , I give you Kendra and her video , and no one need know about engineered birth defects and euthanized newborns . - The video 's on there ? - Yes . There are no copies . - And what about Kendra Dupree ? - She 's in my hotel room . - And the child is with her ? - Yes , that 's right . Do we have a deal ? Like I have a choice . One question . Why euthanasia ? Surely with Brightborn 's resources you ... You 're recording this ? And ready to upload it to every major news network . RACHEL : Let them live out their shortened lives . If even one of these children were discovered , decades of science would have been shelved . At the end of the day , euthanizing severely deformed newborns was the most humane way forward . Now if you 'll excuse me . Wow , she did it . Well done . Welcome . What if I were to tell you that in a few short years , immune deficiencies could be eradicated ? Cancer cured . Blood disease , haemophilia , hereditary blindness , all in our past . - Sound far-fetched ? - ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) Not to me . Because here at Brightborn Technologies ... euthanizing severely deformed newborns was the most humane way forward . Today , we are pleased to announce federal approval ... - ( CELL PHONE CHIMING ) - Must be excruciating . - Of phase three clinical trials ... - Hold her steady . For implantable , bio-engineered gene therapy . ( CELL PHONES CONTINUE VIBRATING AND CHIMING ) - She ' 5 gone . - These randomized ... Excuse me . Are babies being euthanized at Brightborn 's birthing facility ? Do Brightborn treatments cause deformation ? What are you talking about ? Well , we have video of you admitting to euthanizing Brightborn babies . How do you respond ? Can you confirm that these are Brightborn doctors ? ( REPORTERS CLAMORING ) No comment . No further questions . Excuse me . ( CLAMORING CONTINUES ) ( SIGHS ) IRA : Rachel ? Is it happening again ? What did you see ? ( SIGHS ) It isn 't a glitch . It 's the island . There were people there . Someone 's trying to show me something , Ira . ( FIRE CRACKLING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING ) ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GASPS ) KRYSTAL : I have Intel about that French doctor . Ow ! RACHEL : Controlling evolution , it 's the ultimate power . COSIMA : You don 't even care about a cure , do you ? No . SARAH : We don 't belong to anybody , mate ! SUSAN : No , Rachel !

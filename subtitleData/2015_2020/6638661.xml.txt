 CREATIVE CONTROL Translation . Review by Angel . - Good morning , David ! - Hi , Jamie . - It is Becky . - Becky . I am so sorry . That is okay . What is up ? Do you get any sleep last night ? - I feel like a shit . - I think I am still drunk . I think I might shit on my pants , too . Make sure you do that during the presentation . - Can I have a moment ? - Sorry , princess ! - You are late . - I know . Let us go ! - I redid the layout . - Why ? The layout was perfect . You are really throwing that word around a lot lately . Hollis , why are not you this funny ? When you are writing copy . I am sure you are only allowed to tell me . How to do my job if you show up on time . That is like a privilege , not a right . - It is ten after . - I am sorry . You do not need your phone . How do I ... ? Eyes connect to overhead . - You are a genius . - No , I am just younger than you are . Is my hand shaking ? - I cannot find anything . - It is in your hand . You just pinch the one that you want . Cool ! I am like ... I am like an old wino . I do not know why I do this to myself . - Because you are running in fear . - Reny ! Quiet ! I am going to puke on you , David . Button your top button . Showtime ! You do not fuck this up . Inhale , and exhale . In addition , right leg into the sky . Stretch it up . And now , bending at the knee , stacking the hips . Stretching it out again , up to the sky . Now bring it through moreover , between your hands . Now interlace your hands behind your back and come up to a high lunge . We are expanding our awareness , yes ? Now bringing your back foot to the ground , arms overhead . Warrior One . Make sure that your hips are facing the front of the room . If you have to widen your stance a little bit , that is fine . However , make sure your back foot is in total contact . Billy , your foot is not in contact . At any given moment , there are a million things vying for our attention . That is better . Do you feel that ? Therefore , where do we let our attention fall ? Warrior Two . Good , good . A little more sex , please . All right ! Scream , girls . Bigger than feels natural . Big , big , big , big ! More sex . Yeah , we got it ! We got it ! We got it ! How old are these girls , Wim ? They have pimples . - Are we going back to charcoal number two ? - I do not know . What do you think ? Well ! I do not really notice a difference . I know . I too . Well ! We were saying why not get both , right ! So , do we have the option ? No , but what he is saying is that , there is no difference between the two . Like , on camera . Right , Wim ? - Hey ! Are you taking a break ? - Yeah . - Yeah ! What is your name again ? - Casey . Casey ! Okay ! So , Casey , your shit is not really working , is it ? - So , let us change it up . - What ? And you are fucked up on mimosas , or something ? Therefore , that is a problem . Excuse me ? I am saying do not show up to work for me fucked up . Ever . Shit barely works as it is . Barely works . Let us try it again . Yeti , loving you . Loving what you are doing . Damsel , damn . Casey ! Look at you , Casey , you big slugger , stepping to that plate ! Yeah ! Okay ! That is great . You are giving Bobbo a boner over here . - Total boner , women . - Hold on ! Hold on ! I got it . When I started this company . I had a vision that we could enhance real life . With a magical layer in front of it . In order to pull off that technology , it has to be fully immersive . And to be immersive , it has to be seamless . The problem with the existing technologies . And what we have worked so hard to innovate past ... is that it does not actually , seem real . In my opinion , Augmenta is the first , actually convincing , Augmenta reality system . Your competition , at this point , is a household name . More than household , it is ubiquitous . Yeah ! That name signifies something that is new , that works . That people better know about it . Moreover , Augmenta means ... What the fuck is Augmenta ? Well ! We have the only open-source AR system operating is not insignificant . Very true , and I really like it . But I do not know how we market that . Let us talk about what your competitor does . They sell distraction . It is light sabers , it is AR drinking games ... It is picking up chicks with a face scanner . Alternatively , like sentimental crap . Transatlantic father-son guitar lessons . They are playing Hey Jude , who is , I mean , come on ! Yeah ! It is nerdy . And maybe they know that and maybe they do not . However , either way , they do not care in addition , they are not concerned . Because they know that , they have built-in market recognition . They know that they are reliable on the O.S end . - They are not . - But the sad reality is ... You have a boner for the newest face-computer . What are you going to do ? You are going to buy it from the establishment . Okay ! Therefore , that is the problem . How do we address it ? Let us change the whole conversation . Instead of talking about what the technology can do for you . Let us talk about what you can do with the technology . We feel really strongly about this . Augmenta is not Main Street . It is Bedford Avenue . David . What does that mean in reality ? In reality , it means they are all out there masturbating . We are here actually fucking . Yeah ! Augmenta is not a toy . It is an extremely powerful , creative tool . Therefore , this is our approach . We give a pair to a genius-level creative . We let them play around with it . We see what comes back . We might have a new art form on our hands . Not that we care about art . We give a shit about selling your magic glasses , though . Okay ! So , if not some nerd , then who ? Somebody worth learning about it . Therefore , there is an opportunity here to engage people 's imaginations . Put them in the role of creator , rather than just consumer . The great thing about going with Reggie is there are so many different sides to him . It is music , technology , a philosophy , comedy , totally on trend . Is philosophy on trend ? I mean , Reggie is a wizard . He is going to come up with ideas for the interface . You guys never even thought . What do you think ? It is super interesting . Go get the champagne . NEW MESSAGE DAVID - WE GOT IT : P - Here , you go your very own pair . - Wow ! Thanks . - They want us to get very intimate with them . - Okay . What is the matter with you ? You were amazing in there . You should be doing a victory lap around the office , high on cocaine . Those people are just a little intense . - Yeah ! Well , big leagues , big money . - Right . - Okay ? - Yes . All right ! I need you to get me treatments ... on all the bells and whistles on this thing , okay ! - No problem . - All the top apps . I need it tonight . Okay . - Do you have that ? - Yeah . Beautiful . Shit ! What about Phalinex ? Fuck Phalinex , all right ! You do this first . I hate Phalinex . I hate it . It will be the last pharma stuff you will ever have to do , okay ! I promise . You said that last time . Look ! I know you are dying to hack these glasses , okay ! So , just get me the copy , make sure , I see it before it goes out . In addition , make sure you fry it . I have to get a great idea . Why do not you write the copy ? Since you write for a for a 7th grade level naturally . Okay ! I have to go or I am going to get divorced , all right ! You were incredible in there , okay ! Superlative . Exemplary . Give me a pound . Let us blow up this rock . Scott , you are the worst ! You are my favorite customer . Honk ! - I hate you . - I love you . AUGMENTA . Welcome , David ! Hey . What are you doing here ? - Can you watch this stuff for a second ? - Sure . - Thanks . - Okay . - Do you have another one of those ? - Yeah . Thank you . - Thanks . Walk with me . - Okay . Hey , maybe you do not tell Juliette I was smoking . - Not that it would come up , I just ... - No , no problem . So , what is with the bags ? You are delivering drugs now . Alternatively , what is going on ? No , returns . For this job I am on , and they keep bitching about cab fare . So now , I am schlepping it all over the place . That sucks . Yeah , I hate this job , but ... Scan complete . - Things are slow right now . - Yeah . When did you get glasses ? No ! I am just mildly near-sighted . Are not you doing a thing with African prints ? Yeah ! But , we are barely breaking even , I want to get my own studio . I am just really ... I am like terrible with money . Yeah . Would you ever want to do something at Homunculus ? I mean , the people are the absolute worst , however , the money is actually good . - Seriously ? - Yeah . I can throw your hat in the ring . Shit . Do you know what ? That would be amazing . Thank you . Cool ! Yeah , no problem ! Therefore , why do not you move ? With Wim if money is an issue . - Why do you say that ? - No , I just mean you would save on rent . I do not know . I guess I just never thought of myself as the kind of girlfriend . Who was always like hanging around ? Right . I mean , you are living with Juliette . I did not mean ... You know , it is weird . You would think when you live with somebody . You would get to know they well . However , I feel like I have just become more acutely aware ... of how I do not know her at all . Do you know what I mean ? No ! I do not . That sound like real grown-up problems to me . Well ! You are a grown-up now . How old are you ? 18 ? Did you get this bike for graduation ? How did you know ? So , where did you headed to now ? Midtown . Emotional Afghanistan . Yeah . Okay ! I have to go . However , were you serious about that job at your agency ? Yeah ! Or I could get you a job . Working for the mob . That works , too . I mean , I do not know how much experience . You do not need any training . It is actually , if you are a drug addict . - They just hire you right away . - Then , I am perfect for this job . - Thank you . - Nice to see you . - Yeah , see you later . - Yeah ! - Thanks for the smoke . - Yeah ! No problem . Stay hip . Sort of like short vignettes . - Very tonal . - Yes . Just like music with gorgeous shots of models . At the beach , or in the woods , or something . Alternatively , a carnival . My God ! What about in a mental hospital ? - Yeah . Yes . - My God ! I can picture it . - I think that is fabulous . - The girl is half-naked . My God ! And we could do a video . - Do not you think ? - I think it is a great idea . - What do you think ? - Yeah . Yeah ! Fuck it ! Let us do a video . Sounds great . Yeah ! A video will be amazing . Let us do it . - I said yes , Rebecca . I am for it . - My God ! I love it . Jesus Christ ! Look what Wim just sent to me . - Who is that ? - Some model . Someone he is working with . - More like a hobby , I think . - That is classy . He always was . - Somebody has been smoking . - No . - I feel bad for Sophie . - Why ? Well ! He acts as if she is cool with it . However , I think she has no idea . - Do you think she is seeing other people ? - No . Why ? Well ! I do not know . Does it seem like that to you ? I do not know . They are your friends . Why are you so worried about it anyways ? - I am not worried about it . - Do you have a crush on Sophie ? Give me a break . Sophie is like my little sister . Sophie is like my little sister . Really ? Wim used to act guilty about it , at least . Now if I think it is weird , he acts like I do not get how life works . How much do you think it costs to lease an electric car ? Depends on what kind . I do not know , just something small that runs . That way we can go Upstate on the weekends . You are going Upstate tomorrow . I know , but this way you can come with me . No . - Really ? That is your answer . - What ? - Are you drunk ? - You can tell I want to have sex , right ? - Sort of . - But are you ignoring me for some reason ? No ! You just started and now you are over there and you stopped . - Because you were not into it . - Into what ? Sex with me , sweetheart . - Okay , stop yelling . - I am not yelling . You grabbed my breast for like 15 seconds and now ... - You are sitting over there yelling at me . - Yeah . - You are drunk . - Because you were ignoring me . Okay , David , just stop shouting . You are having , like , a little temper tantrum . That has absolutely nothing to do with me . It is because you are drunk . You are looking at pictures . - Of , like , chicks ' asses , and Sophie . - I was talking about Wim . I was talking about my relationship with Wim . Then you want me to like . What ? I do not know . - Spread my legs for you and like , hump you . - Okay , back up . - I do not know what you want . - We are supposed to want to have sex . Right ? Okay . I will tell you what . Next time you come in here , moreover , you grab my breast like a little baby . Forget it . Then you whine about it like a little baby . Then I will know what you really want to do is just have sex with me . Why do not you fuck that ? - Be better than you right now . - That is hilarious . I always used to say to myself , I want a funny girlfriend . Augmenta Reality Beta Three . Render complete . - I am going to take a picture . - Okay . - I am going to miss the train . - He said five minutes . - I do not want to go . - You always feel this way . Then you end up having a great time . You are going to meet new students , they are going to love you . You are establishing your brand . - You just want me to go . - I do not . I hate being away from you . I never get used to it . All right ! Stay out of trouble . Thank you . - Hey ! - Thanks . - I love you . - I love you . Have fun . Come in ! - Hi . - Put it away . What ? - Hi , David . - Hi . - Bye , baby . - Bye , sweetie . I feel like I interrupted something . No , not at all . She is just going to work . She is a working girl . Ciao , Guido . Choose any bed you want . Sorry ! I requested a single . - Really ? - Yeah . See , we are actually all booked up this weekend . Therefore , we had to move the sleeping charts around . However , I will see what I can do . Sorry ! I said anything . This is fine . I will see if I can move some of the students in here . I am sorry I brought it up . Juliette , it is really not a big deal . We are so excited to have you here . I will see what I can do , okay ! Thank you . - First yoga class is at 5 : 00 , okay . - Great . I will leave you to relax for a bit . Okay ! Thank you ! Fucking hippies . - The interface is sick . - I know . It is going to be weird when we all have chips in our brain . No . It will not seem weird then . It will seem inevitable . The people who do not do it will be the weird ones . It will be like the Amish . Moreover , we will all be like , I almost envy their simplicity . What is this ? What is the password for this thing ? What is this ? - Nope . - Give me the password . - Nope . - Cock tease . I have not perfected it yet . Because you are a man of perfection , are not you ? - Wow ! Fuck . - Did you hurt yourself ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - What is your password ? - I do not know . Hi . Hi . - I am Govindas . - We have met . I like to keep it casual up here . So I thought it would be nice if we taught together . And taught a couple of poses at a time . That seems somewhat awkward . Maybe you should just take this class and I will take the next one . No , it will be great . Great ! So right hand on the hip , spin the chest open , lift your toes , and then from your feet go ahead and send the right arm up . From your back , too , all right ! Press the heels and see if , from your feet . And from your back , you can send the arm up . And open the right hand , then your back will make a little more space ... for your lungs , right ! For your face . See if you can relax while getting a little bit bigger . Yeah ? Great ! Beautiful ! Keep the breath nice and long . And actually , if you let your butt stick out a little bit . While keeping your tailbone in , then you naturally create more space in your back . And then if you twist your front foot out towards the back of the room . Then your back can come in , and you have added integrity to the pose as well . Great ! The ones from New Hampshire are terrible . Holy shit ! It is El-P . Shit ! Jaime ? - What is going on , man ? How are you ? - Hey . I am so sorry about what happened with that editorial . - It was totally out of my hands . - Yeah , yeah , yeah ! He is ... He is apologizing . - I had no idea they were going to do that . - Yeah . No . Thanks . - Thanks for the apology , man . Thanks . - Jaime . - No , no , it is cool . - Jaime ! - Jaime ? - Stop saying my name , man . - Kind of a grump . - Yeah ! - What is going on with that model ? - Model ? Shit , yeah ! - Can you keep a secret , right ? - Nope . Who am I going to tell it ? Let us think about that for a second , David . Who in the world might you tell it ? - No , I will not . - Your special soul mate , maybe . - Might run it by her ? - I will not . Holy shit ! You live in a movie . I know . I do live in a movie and it is great . What if ... ? What if Sophie saw that ? Hey , you do not let Juliette look at your phone , do you ? No . - David ? - No . - Because you cannot do that , it is not healthy . - I know . Seriously , like triple-encrypt that shit . You cannot ... That is yours . Okay . Would you like to go to a party ? - Yes , I would . - Yeah . - Do you know Michael Caine ? - Who ? Michael Caine . Excuse me ! I will be right back . Okay ! Is this for me ? - Hello ? - Hi , baby . Hey ! Where are you ? Just some weird club with Wim . Cool ! So , how is it going ? - Well ! It is somewhat weird here . - Yeah ? Like how ? How ? Govindas is in the hot tub naked with two students . Hey , you are kind of breaking up . I just , I do not know why , I just want to come home . I cannot really hear you , sweetheart ! It is very loud there . Yeah , I mean , it is a club . It sounds like you are having a great time . Listen , sweetheart , maybe could I call you back in a little bit ? Great ! Great ! I hope you have a great time . Hello ? Sweetheart ? Hi . Wow ! Hi . I am going to stop drinking . - Do not you have a 9 : 00 a.m. ? - David . Sorry . - I love you . - I love you . All right ! - So camera . Should cut as well then ? - Yeah . Is that something ? We can get for today . - David ? Another camera ? - Yeah , just for some options . This is in addition to the three cameras we already have . Well , now we were thinking that we could have one always rolling , that way we could get rehearsals , whatever happens between takes . - Yeah , I think it is a great idea . - Make it more natural . Four cameras . More natural . I got it . This is happening . Right now . Right , David ? Yes , it is . Okay , is anybody not ready ? All right ! Great , then let us roll camera . Here we go . Moreover , action ! Panic attacks made I lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . Cut . I cannot , I cannot even hear the name of the product , okay ? - Phalinex . - Okay . I thought that was a lot better . Great ! But just really , we have to emphasize Phalinex . Okay . Okay . Hey , Mike , that was great . You just really want to make sure that you emphasize the word Phalinex . Phalinex . Okay . Moreover , let we roll , please . We are already rolling . To capture the magic between takes , right ! Okay , is not anybody ready ? Here we go . This is the one . This is the take . Everybody quiet , please . Action . Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . - Cut . - Cut . I do not think it is clear that it is back in the chair . He has got to stress the word back . All right ! So Phalinex , big punch , also back , a big punch . - Mike ? - Yes ? That was great . Let us just make sure to punch both Phalinex , moreover , the word back , please . Yeah ! It is like a one-two punch . It is as if Phalinex put me back ! Boxing . Moreover , action . Panic attacks made I lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . That was great , Mike . You are getting there . Okay ! I am sorry . I am just confused . How are we supposed to know ? That he is a pilot . He is wearing a pilot 's outfit moreover , he is in a cockpit . Well ! I am not buying it . Hit the word pilot harder , so that I can hear it . He could say , I am a pilot , at the beginning . - Is the other camera here ? - It is coming . It is on its way . Okay ! Scott , I do not know . Maybe it is a costume thing . - But I am not seeing a pilot . - Okay ! We will fix it . I just ... I do not understand why you have to make . Listen ! You are not paying ... Okay . He looks like an MTA employee ! I need him to look like a pilot . - I do not see why that is difficult . - Absolutely . No . You know what I think might work ... is I have this really great vintage bomber 's jacket . Do you want to slip this on real quick ? He could be like a cool , edgy pilot . Who wears his own jacket over his uniform . Let me see this . - I like it . Let Us get that shot . - I think this is going to work . Can I get you anything ? Yes ! I would love goat milk caramel latte , please . No foam . That looks great . You look awesome . Has he gained weight since casting ? - I am glad you are here . - No problem . Action ! Panic attacks made I lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . - Cut . - Cut . It is still not working . It is not the jacket , it is him . He is not very good . - He is not taking the direction at all . - Go fuck yourself , woman ! Emphasis on Fuck ! I am not a Muppet ! I will go talk to him . Yeah ! Tell him he is doing a great job . This is tough stuff . Fuck ! Fuck ! Hi , Gary . Hey , hey . I know . I am late . Yeah , yeah . It is okay , though , Govindas has it . Therefore , we are good . - It will not happen again . - Right . No , I am sorry . I am just . I am kind of going through a weird transition right now , Mercury is in retrograde , so . Yeah , I know . Hey ! Listen , Juliette . I am thinking maybe that Govindas takes this slot from this point forward . I think that is the right move . - But those are my students . - Well ! Technically no . No , yeah . I have been building this class for like a year , Gary . Right . However , it is like this , okay . It is like when an instructor comes on time . And draws a lot of students here . Then we help more people and make more money . Do you get that , right ? Right . You know that he fucks his students , right ! Yeah ! I mean ... I ... Yeah . Like here in the sauna . - Really ? In the sauna ? - Yeah . Is that what you want me to do ? Do you want me to fuck my students in the sauna ? If it would help , you get here on time . I would say yes . Yeah ! I guess . Right ? - Do you know what ? You are an asshole ! - I am not saying . No , no , no , I quit . Fuck you ! - I am not saying fuck people in the ... - Fuck you . In the sauna . ♪ So , stack them , so neatly in a row . ♪ ♪ We want to be here now . ♪ ♪ And do not forget your glasses , too . ♪ Let us eat . - Can I get real with you people ? - Please . Do any of you know what Augmenta is ? Well , yeah , it is ... It is our product . Okay . Wrong answers . Magic . Magic is what Augmenta is . Making people believe . Not forcing them . But making them believe that this is something so easy to use . That they have been using it all their lives , even though they know consciously . That they have never used this product before . That is magic . This is why we think ? That you are perfect for this campaign . We showed some of your videos to Margie and she were just dying . Yes . That is what I am talking . Yeah ! We were thinking . It would be great if you could get some ... behind-the-scenes with Cordon . Hanging out with him . Reggie , I think us all agree . That we want it is the authentic . Reggie is an experience . How do you interface with Augmenta organically ? The last thing we want it to be is contrived , right ? Yeah ! We want the real deal in addition , we want the real Reggie . That is exactly right . That is why I was so excited when I heard from Alicia . That this was even considered to be a possibility . I was so jazzed about it because it is hard to find a situation . Where you are working on this level . However , are still allowed full artistic . You know expression . Okay ! Well ! You know that it is a mainstream product . Gabe will shut the fuck up ! You got Reggie and David handling this . You got everything under control . You have the two top people in the business . And you are bitching like a bitch . Let us enjoy ourselves , okay ! You got a $ 100 piece of Jamb on heading your way . Chill the fuck out , enjoy your life for fuck 's sake ! Come on , wieners ! Can we get a couple more of this Châteauneuf-du-Papes ? - She is somewhat boring to me . - Do you know ? - You are jealous of her . - Well , no . - No ? Yeah , I think you are jealous of her . - I mean , absolutely ... - Hey , guys . - Hi . - Hey . What is up ? - Hi . - Sophie ? - Yes . - Hey . This ... - What is that ? This is Green Dragon . It will increase Augmenta your experience . - Do you people into it ? - Holy moly ! All right ! Okay , just a little bit here . One , two , three , four , five , eight , ten . Wow ! - And one , two , three , four ... - I mean is that the correct dose ? - Okay . - I am a small person . Yeap ! - Cheers . - Goodbye . Goodbye . It is nice knowing you . Do you see ? How the mind is receiving consciousness . Rather than creating it . It is as if the brain is an operating system . And built into that operating system is a series of glitches . Yeah ! If you think of life as a closed system . You divide a line then shift it . Then you have a spiral . Moreover , we are afraid of spirals . Definitely more comfortable with loops . Because you know , where you are going to end up . Do you know ? What does that mean ? - You get it . - I totally get it now . Panic attacks made I lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . Lightweight . I never knew you were so cool . - Yeah . It grows , right ? - Yeah . Like bacteria . - Switch . - Switch . Thanks . So , are you near-sighted ? Yeah . Do you have been recording me the whole time ? I should go home . Yeah ! I too . Thank you . You are a star , Sophie . - Thank you , David . - For what ? Everything . So . Are you near-sighted ? Do you have been recording me the whole time ? Come here . Stop . Come here . Sit on me . Fuck me . Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . Still rather , dull it , do not you think ? It is fine . It is great . We are all going to Cannes . Put the warning on and send it . Do you have that copy ? The warning stuff ? That is not my job , Hollis . How is that not your job ? They are approving constantly . Hey ! Hi . How are you ? - I have a headache . - Tell me about it . I sort of lost track of what I wanted to say . I can tell . Was it about last night ? Yes . Yeah , that was a surprise . When I woke up today . I thought I would dream it . We should ... We should be careful . Okay . That is the ... This is the general point is ... Right , that is what they said that they wanted to work in ... Therefore , we are somewhat like working around that , but ... They had dragon fruit at the market . Dragon fruit is by far the most exotic of fruits . Thank you . This is delicious . - Thank you . - You are getting so good at cooking . - So , how was your day at work ? - It was good . I met with Reggie moreover , he showed me some stuff . It is really coming along . Do you want to hear something crazy ? Sure ! Do you have ever heard of Coltan ? ( known industrially as tantalite ) Coltan ? It is this rare Earth mineral that they get from the mines in Congo . Moreover , they have these children that work there , for these warlords , I guess . However , they do not pay them anything . I mean , they do not even make enough to eat . Wow ! And there is no regulations or anything . So , if they do anything wrong , the children , they cut off their arms . - That is terrible . - Yeah . Baby , when you think about it , what they use it for ... it is stuff that we use every day . I mean , it is like ... - Cell phones , laptops , and everything . - That is fucked up . Do you think that they use it ? To make those goggles that you are working on . I doubt it . Really ? Honestly , I do not really , know . I think they do . - I could find out for you if you want . - They are called Augmenta , right . Right , then they do . I checked . Okay . Is not it crazy ? I am going to go get some more wine . Why would you ask me ? I mean . If you already knew . Is that likes a trap or something ? What ? No ! No , it just ... I think it is so terrible . What they are doing to the children , when you think about why ... So , that we can check our email in our sunglasses . Which is like the last thing that we need in the world right now . Why do you look at that stuff ? It just makes you upset . That is not the point . What is the point ? Well ! I just thought you would want to know . I mean . You are helping them ... You are helping them sells these things , so ... My God ! - So ... - You just said they use it in everything . Yeah ! However , this is something that you are working on . So , should I do what Juliette ? Go mention to the marketing department of this giant corporation . That my girlfriend read a couple of articles . - On the Internet ! - No . That is not what I am saying . That they may be implicated in chopping the arms off young children . So , thanks for giving us all this money . Why would you chop off the arms of someone who works in your mine ? - Okay ! It is to frighten the others , obviously . - No , no . When you are working with these Multi-national corporations . They are liable for that kind of stuff and they look out for it . I read the article . That is not how it works . Well ! The article was wrong . It was in the New York Times . Then the New York Times was wrong . - It has been known to happen . - Okay . Okay . This is bullshit . Do you quit your job ? Because they do one thing you do not like . - Really ? - And then you spend all day . Researching the Internet for evidence that the world is a terrible place . Not because you are going to do anything about it . Because you want to paint me as some kind of selfish , greedy asshole . - Which I am very not . - No ! They do not ask me what companies I want to work for , okay . They tell me what to do . I try to do a good job . Does not that bother you ? So what ? Should I go live on top of a mountain ? Away from the evils of capitalism . What the fuck are you talking ? Why not ? Why not ? You are so stressed out all the time . I mean . I see you are just taking all these pills . - Like the Xanax . - God . No ! I am not . Valium . Yes , you are . Then you pound scotch until you are like a zombie . I find it really interesting this has suddenly become an issue . Just as my shit is starting to take off at the agency . You know , this is the first time in seven years . That I have had any kind of creative control over what we are doing , right ? I am winning , so there must be something wrong . Something is wrong ! You are unhappy , all of the time . Juliette , if you are so concerned about how stressed out I am . Why do not you crawl back to Gary ? And kiss his ass to get your job back . Because as it stands right now . - Okay ! Fine ! - My blood money ... - Is the only thing that is supporting us ? - Fine ! - Fine , I am sorry , okay . - And let me tell you something else . - I am sorry ! - You know in the back of your mind . You can always fall back on your parents . - That is not fair . - Which is why you have the luxury ? Of researching the plight of the third world . Which by the way , - You do not yell at me ! - I know you are not going to do anything about it . - You do not yell at me . - You are hypocrite ! Jesus Christ ! You are like a 12 years old . Who just found out there is other people in the world ... besides you ! Text Sophie . Meet me at the Wythe Hotel . Question Mark sends . Thanks . Thanks . Thanks . Thanks . Do you have been recording me the whole time ? What is up , Reggie ? Hey . David . So , yeah ! I was thinking about this visual synthesizer thing . With the augmented technology , and it is cool , but it is a little bit ... I do not know , a little bit too much in the entertainment arena . So , and that is cool obviously . But I am kind of interested in deeper implications with the technology . Yeah ! Really to change your psychological outlook . - Yeah , totally . - On what it means to be who you are . Yeah . It sounds good . I think that that is heavier . That is a heavier concept . As an example , there was this homeless lady . That I did a 3D rendering of under a bridge . And I was like Wow ! How could I incorporate that into my reality ? And it was absolutely . And completely horrifying . And I was like ... Wow ! That is what is missing . Do you know ? In order to get down into the things . That you would normally try to avoid all of your life . Until maybe the end of your life where you are like . I should have confronted that . But now we can give the people an option to confront it now . There is a lot of now-ness going on with this . That technology will go to be amazing . People , are going to wish they never put on those glasses . - Yeah . - But , they are going to be thankful . - When they do take them off . - That sounds great . And they are going to think what was that ? And put them back on again . I think that is a new . Ultra humanistic therapeutic tool . And I am just really excited . And I think it is going to be ... I think it is going to be awesome . So , anyways , what do you think ? - It sounds great , Reggie . Really . - Really ? Okay . Cool . All right ! I am going to get started on that right away .

Man , thank you . - What is going on ? Did you met somebody ? - No ! Not really . Dude , it is me . Who is she ? Do I know her ? I do not think so .

That is ... - Right ? I had to hide her in the studio still Sophie fell asleep . - I was hoping she would not smell her on me . - Yeah . Fuck . Fuck crazy , man . Good thing she was drinking that night . - So , are you going to break up with Sophie ? - What do you mean ? I mean . You got involved with this model . Do not you think subconsciously ? Maybe do you want to get out ? Of the situation that you are . - Whose side are you on , pal ? - No , I am on your side . I am on your side . However , I mean , that is a ... That is a close call , man . That is a close call . How long are you going to keep this secret ? Do you know what I mean ? Think about what you are doing to Sophie . - I mean , it is crazy . That is ... - Fuck ! You are right . I mean , I have to cut things off with this chick , right ? Is it crazy ? It is crazy what I am doing . I am a loser . Am I a loser ? No , you are not a loser , man . We are both losers . You are a bigger loser than I am . Sack of shit ! - I love you . Do you know that ? - I love you , too . You are handsome . You are a handsome person . - Let us go back in there . - Okay . Hi . Hi . Well , you look like a shit . You are drinking . I have a knack for it . Do you remember ? Look ! I am sorry .

Panic attacks are making me lose control . - Jamie ! - It is . It is Becky . You are so gorgeous . Thank you . That is nice . Are you okay ? Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's seat . Honey . - How are you ? - I am good . - You , David , let us go this way . - All right ! I was thinking about why we do not hang out more . I realized that last year at the Christmas party . I said something to you that might have been racist . - Buddy , you are here . - Scott . - Are you okay ? - I am okay . We are going to blow their minds . Consciousness , and not matter . Is the fundamental element of reality ? With which we have created . Is the atomic symbolization ? Of those people who wish to understand as though it is just a binary reality . In all that we are and all that we will ever be . It is not so much the tree and the organisms of single cellular structures . That form in the molecular bonds that we have to understand . But is the quantum phasic entanglement . And it is who we desire to be through pain and justice and understanding . The illusion , which keeps us in our place . Remember . If you do not have enough stuff to do . You can always remember that , you are a conscious individual . And all is one . Namaste . I can see the head . Keep pushing . Yeah ! Fuck yeah ! AUGMENTA Because you are worth it . I do not get what they are so upset about , Scott . They say antisocial and grotesque like that is always bad . Wait ! I am with you but ... Reggie is trying to get people to confront their shadow . All right ! Cool , so we will get different footage from him . Why ? Because they hated the footage he provided . Well , I can spell it out for them if they are too stupid to get it , okay . However , I am not going to just rip it out of Reggie 's hands ! All right ! Calm down and please just contact him about something else . Are we going to test it ? Are we going to test it ? Before we throw this away . You know , I have been killing myself on this , right ! - I have been killing myself ! - We are not going to test it , okay ! Contact him now ! I do not have time for this shit , you pussy ! My wife has cancer ! Do you think I need to hear about your footage ? Fuck off ! Get out of here , for fuck 's sake ! Why are we even talking about this ? Hey , David . How is it going ? Hey , Reggie . Look ! We have got a situation . The ... - The client wants to look at some of the ... - I am just kidding . I am not here . If you get this , it is probably because I just left for a place called Brazil . I will be there for three months , and I am going to be off the grid , most likely in some kind of a dilapidated structure . Maybe a lean to a hut perhaps just a common tent . And a simple shelter made out of leaves . But if you need to get a hold of me . Obviously hire a shaman . Or a remote viewer . Send me a psychic message , I will get it . And I will send one back to you . See you later . I am going to get high . - Hey . - Hey . Therefore , we lost Augmenta . We are eating like 500 . Shit ! The people in London called . They are making me fire you . Okay . I need the glasses back . Hi . Hey , man , almost done . One more . - Where do you have been ? - Work . Work . Well ! I had to go get an engagement ring all by myself . Thank you very much . Hasid screws us . - Are you getting married ? - Well , one-step at a time . Why do not you get the Prosecco ? We will celebrate . Well ! I like that idea . You are getting married ! Why are you looking at me like that ? Why not ? - Because I love you . - What are you talking ? You said no one ever touched you like that before . David , I think you have got the wrong idea . No , you cannot do that all of a sudden . Just pretend you do not know what the fuck I am talking . I do not know what the fuck you are talking . I am in love with you . - Okay , you need to stop saying that . - I love you . David , you do not even know me , and you are acting like an insane person . What is going on , guys ? David has something he needs to tell you . Okay . I am in love with Sophie . Weird ! - Do you love David ? - No . Well ! That is good to hear . So , what now ? - You cannot marry Wim . - Why not ? Because he is cheating on you with this , model that he ... - Shut up , man . - You hit me . Shut the fuck up ! Where are you going ? Where are you going ? Yeah ! Hold that . Where are you going ? Are you getting up ? Stay down , man . That is enough ! - Are you done ? - Fuck both of you ! Right there is good . That is the one . - David ! - Hi . - You are here . - I live here . - What happened to your eye ? - I was punched in the face . Who was that person in the hall ? He is from Yoga , right . Govindas ? Wait ! Did Govindas hit you ? No ! Wim did . - I thought that person 's name was Brett . - Wait . However , why would Wim hit you ? This has something to do with Sophie , does not it ? Look ! It is not what you are thinking . I was ... I was using the glasses , and I do not really even , know what happened . It is okay ! I am sure he will forgive you . Juliette , why was that person , Brett , here ? Govindas sent him . It means servant of love . Okay ! Why was the servant of love in our building ? David , if I tell you . You have to promise not to get mad . Look ! When you left . You just disappeared . You would not answer my texts , you did not talk to me . You were like a stranger . I did not have anything . I did not have a home anymore . And then he came and he brought me to the ceremony . I had the most amazing experience . It was as if I could see everything from the outside . Like all of the pain and all of the suffering . And everything that I did to you , and you did to me , and everybody . And everybody in the whole world , there were like thousands of us . Moreover , we were all one , though ... because we are all just on the inside . We all just want to be good , in addition , we just want to be loved . - Are you high right now ? - No ! Look ! I understand how this all sounds , okay ! However , everything just collapsed into this one second , He just ... He sang to me . - Did he sing to you ? - Yes . Jesus Christ ! - David , why will not you just listen to me ? - Because you are ranting . I have no idea what you are trying to say to me . Well ! Can you let ? I explain , then . You are worried we had sex . Are you ? Yes . God ! You do not be mad . David , it was incredible . We were at the peak of this whole experience . I was looking into his eyes , and that are ... - Please , stop . - No , no . That is when I saw you . I saw you . I realized that loving him ... was loving you , was loving me , because we are all one . Did you fuck him here ? Did you fuck him in our bed ? David , I love you . I love you . All this shit that I have been doing to myself and doing to you . And blaming you for blaming me , it is not us . Do you know ? You are an addict . However , you are not ... You are not addicted to the pills , okay ! You are just addicted to this like , misery and pain . The cycle of misery and pain , in addition , you bring me into it . However , we do not have to do that anymore . We do not have to do that because it is not real . What do you mean ? It is not real ! I do not know how else to explain it . - I had this incredible orgasm . - My God ! No , no , no , please wait , just listen to me , okay ! Because , no , I had this orgasm . It was like my body left me . I just became , like , light . Moreover , I saw you . In nature . We were together . We knew how to talk to each other . Now I know it must be real because you are here . Wait ! When was this ? Like a half an hour ago . The orgasm where your body disappeared . I know it is a lot to take in , okay ! I understand if you do not believe me . No . I understand . No ! I mean I can rather see it . Are you ? I mean ... I have no idea what you are talking . However , I believe you . Really ? The city is killing us in small excrement . You used always to say that . - I thought you were just complaining . - I was . No . You were right . We have to get out of here . We do not have to go right now . Yeah ! We are going to move to Upstate . Get an old farmhouse . My mommy has that friend , Wendy . Who buys all that property Upstate . - And fixes it up . - Yeah . Right . We could do that . We could find one with a barn . I will fix it up . You do not know how to fix up a barn . Yeah ! I will learn how to fix up a barn , and I will learn blacksmith . - You are not going to be a blacksmith . - No , I will write my book in there . You should finish that , it was so good . You can teach Yoga to the elderly and infirm . No ! I am going to learn how to cook . I am going to be a good chef . Okay ! I do not believe you , but ... - I am hungry . Should I call Wendy ? - Yes . - I love you . - I love you , too . We should find a place without cell phone service . - What the fuck do you want ? - David , hey , hangs on . - Satan . - This thing on the glasses . - Yes . - The thing you made of Sophie . It is incredible , you are a little genius ! I do not know what the fuck you are talking about , man . That avatar thing . It is amazing ! They are freaking out ! Holy shit ! David , listen to me . They are freaking out , okay . They stopped the roll out . They want to make the Sophie avatar the spokesperson for Augmenta . They will de-emphasize the sex stuff . Gabe says it is implied . Well ! You already fired me , Scott . So I do not know what the fuck you want . No ! They want to redo everything ! We have to go to Malaysia . They are on the phone with them right now . They said bring us the man who made this ! What did you tell them ? I said I would call him right now ! David ! We are gold . This is huge . I know Malaysia sounds far and it is far as hell .

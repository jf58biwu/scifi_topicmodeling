 My name is Molly Woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband John , a robotics engineer , created a lifelike robot called a Humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is Ethan . This is what we wanted . Everything changed when I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . - I 'm pregnant . - How is that even possible ? The child , part human , part alien , was unlike anything the world had ever seen . How did you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . You need to tell them not to come . I can 't . We need to survive . We know this being can somehow access our minds and make us see and do things beyond our control . Ethan tried to stop him ... I know he 's your son . I won 't hurt him again . And sacrificed himself in the process . Run ! Ethan ? We lost Ethan . And my other son ... is still out there . Hey . What 's the matter ? Change scenario . - Let 's get some ice cream . - Hot fudge sundae ? With whipped cream and sprinkles . And pistachio ice cream . Pistachio . I miss you , sweetheart . I 'm right here , Mom . Molly Woods , your virtual reality session is terminated . It 's time for your medication . Molly Woods ... it 's time for your medication . Molly Woods ... this is my third and final request . Can we give you a ride home ? It 's okay . It 's pretty cold outside . You must be freezing . We aren 't gonna hurt you . Don 't know how old . Maybe ten or 11 ? Hasn 't said a word since we found him . Four , four and a half feet tall . Wearing a red hooded sweatshirt , jeans , sneakers . About an hour ago . Appreciate that , Officer . How soon can you get here ? Yes . 2087 Farmdale Road . Ed ... Ed ! Justin ! Justin , your mommy and daddy are right here , baby ! Come on , son , open the door . - What the hell is going on here ? - Baby , Mama 's coming ! Oh , my baby ! Oh , sweetie . Oh , baby ... What the ... _ At that point , Senator , having lost all communication with Mission Control , and knowing that the spores were contained on the Seraphim , I made the call to destroy the station . I managed escape pod separation just 18 seconds before the station 's detonation . It was at that time that you and colleague Sean Glass made your way back to Earth . Yes , sir . - And Mr. Glass ? - He died . - Very shortly after our return . - But you were not affected by the spores ? No , sir . These microbes , or spores , as you call them , have been definitively confirmed as alien life-forms ? Yes , Senator , and without a doubt , there is life out there . How can you be certain that the threat to Earth has been contained ? When the Seraphim exploded , the alien microbes were destroyed in space , and no longer pose a threat to us . So , to your best knowledge , no alien life-forms have set foot on the planet Earth ? No ETs running around trying to phone home ? That is correct . Well , thanks to your efforts , Dr. Woods , we owe you a debt of gratitude for showing extreme bravery in terrifying circumstances . This hearing is now adjourned . Bravo to Molly Woods . You okay ? Well , I just lied under oath , Toby , so , no , I am not okay . Molly , what good would it do to scare the hell out of the public ? Especially when we know the threat has been contained ? What do you think would happen if we told them the truth ? - Anarchy . - Exactly . I 've been heading up the Global Security Commission for six very long months now . Learned more about pandemics , terrorist threats and ... aliens than anyone should know , if they ever want to sleep at night . Most important thing I 've learned ... people spook easily . And when they spook , they do irrational things , dangerous things . General ? The car 's ready to take you and Dr. Woods to the airport . Thank you . - Come on . - Toby ... are you sure he 's dead ? Had some sort of seizure right after that couple picked him up a few weeks back . We 've got the body , if you need to see the pictures . No , I don 't need to see . I just had to ask you one last time . He was dangerous , Molly . I know . The weight of the world is officially off your shoulders . Get some rest . Take a vacation , for God 's sake . When you get back , I 'll take you and John for dinner , and we can all reminisce about my drunken toast at your wedding . When you proposed to me ? Hey , well , you can 't blame a guy for trying . Come on . I thought for sure John 'd be here . Where is the competition today ? Where he always is . Okay , let 's try this again . Better ? Something 's limiting his sensor pathways . The response isn 't proportionate to the stimulus . The calibration of his hand touch receptors must be off . Probably because of his upgraded body . His responses seem pretty close to normal . - Watch yours . - It 's not the palm . His fingertip sensitivity 's weak . Your fingertips seem pretty responsive . Julie ... Molly . Hey . I wasn 't expecting you till tomorrow . I took the last flight out . Thought I 'd surprise you . I have an even better surprise for you . Come here . - Hi , Molly . - Julie . He 's ready . What ? He 's ready ? - Yeah . - I thought it was gonna be months . No , his-his neural pathways , his-his consciousness , was intact . It-it-it took much less time than I expected . - Okay . - Here . Go ahead . Ethan . Mom . Oh , God . Oh ! Oh ! Ethan . You 're back . It feels weird . Weird how ? To be back in my body again , but ... bigger . Well , that 's ' cause you 're growing up . Can you describe where you 've been ? It was like I was a bird , free to go anywhere , and now I 'm ... not . Did I die ? No , no , somehow , you uploaded yourself to the cloud , just before the explosion . Turns out , you-you-you can 't die exactly . Because I 'm not human . No . You 're so much more than that . Ethan , you saved my life on the Seraphim . You sacrificed yourself for me . Now , that was brave and very selfless of you . And you may not be ... technically human , but you 've got more humanity in you than most people on this planet . And that 's all that matters . You hear me ? I hear you . Good . You 're my son ... and I love you . No matter what happens . - Gina ? - Yes , Molly ? I 'd like to see ... security cam footage from the week of July 10 . The week before you returned from space ? Yes . That 's right . I 'm sorry , Molly , but cameras were offline during that period . Gina ... Peter Robot has a motion-activated camera , right ? Yes , Molly . Can you access that drive ? Same time frame , please . What would you like to see ? All footage of John . And Julie . Gina , can you go to last time stamp , please ? Is there sound ? Sorry . Peter Robot is video only . Can you use facial rec software to analyze and translate ? I 'll try , Molly . " ... do this anymore . She 's coming home . " " This isn 't right . What we have is special . " " Molly has been away a year . " " built a family . " " You can 't just take that and throw it away like it doesn 't mean any ... " " Do you love me ? " Stop playback . Molly , it 's been over for a while , I swear . It was a mistake . A mistake ? A mistake ... is a coding error ... or a broken plate . This , what you 've been doing is lying ... over and over and over . Yes , I did . I lied , but ... it didn 't happen in a vacuum . - You-you were not here . - I 'm an astronaut . It 's my job . This is not about going to space , Molly . There 's a piece of you that 's ... not in this marriage , and never has been . Well , if you weren 't happy , then you should 've said something , not screw your lab assistant in our house ! - Are you John Woods ? - Yeah . I have a court order authorizing the seizure of the Humanich . What are you talking about ? The Humanich has been declared the property of the U.S. Government for reasons of national security . Dad ! He 's not property ... he 's our son ! - Mom ! - Ethan ! Ethan ! Get your hands off me ! - Ethan ! - Ethan ! Ethan ! Don 't worry ! We 're gonna come get you ! - Mom ! Mom ! - Ethan ! Marko , increase the speed by 15 miles per hour . That will exceed legal speed limits by 32 % . Okay , override the safeties . Do it . The general 's expecting you . Right this way . Sure . Uh-huh . Well , get ... get back to me as soon as you can . What 'd you find out ? Where are they taking him ? They can 't do this , Toby . This is kidnapping ! I need you both to sit down . HomeSec perceives Ethan to be a threat to national security . What ? ! What ? That 's ridiculous ! Ethan hacked directly into the ISEA mainframe , which was bad enough , but then he blew up a building . Saving Molly and potentially everyone on the planet . For God 's sake , Toby , he 's a hero ! - He 's a little boy ! - Who blew through terrasoc firewalls like they were tissue paper , Molly . There are some genuine concerns here that you can 't ignore . The timing 's a bit convenient , no ? Molly gets into bed with the GSC , an arm of HomeSec , and now suddenly Ethan 's being decommissioned ? Come on , Toby , wha ... what 's this really about ? This is much bigger than Ethan . The whole Humanichs project is being mothballed , John . What ? All service bots rated 4.0 or higher are being seized and decommissioned . Now , this comes from the highest level of HomeSec . And I have pulled every string , I have made every call there is to make . Now , my hands are tied on this , I 'm sorry . No , no , we 're gonna fight this in court , Toby . We 're gonna sue them for unlawful detention ! A national security letter can 't be challenged in court . Really ? I lied for my government under oath ... and this is how they repay my so-called patriotism ? By taking my son ? Ethan is more than a robot , we all know that , but in the eyes of the law and the powers that be ... he 's still not human . He 's more human than any one of those asses . No . This isn 't over . Where are you taking me ? Will I see my mom and dad again ? Quiet , robot . Team leader , stand by for transfer details . Hey ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Hello , Rabbit . I 'm sorry , sir ... this area 's off-limits . - I 'm Dr. John Woods , and this is my lab . - I know who you are ... and you no longer have authorized access . We 'll see about that . I will forcibly remove you if need be , sir . - John . - Julie . Thank God you 're here . They-They 've locked us out . They took Ethan last night . Okay , let 's not talk about it here . Okay ? This is a nightmare . We need to get hold of Ethan 's hard drives before they 're destroyed . Molly 's devastated about him . And us . I 'm sorry she had to find out that way . Listen , there 's something I need to tell you , and I want you to listen before you react . Okay ? HomeSec contacted me and asked me to run a few tests . What kind of tests ? To see if Humanichs could quickly be adapted for ... defense purposes . Well , that 's-that 's absurd . It would take years for a Humanich to mature enough to handle morally ambiguous situations like combat . You 're going to bypass the protocols . It 's for a good cause , John ... defending our country . We 've seen firsthand the threats that are out there . That 's how they convinced you ? Service to country ? Julie , this is not patriotic . This is insane . I swore I 'd never let this happen again . I invented the protocols so that Humanichs have time to learn right from wrong through exposure and experience ... it 's crucial . To bypass the protocols is crazy . Worse , it would be dangerous . Don 't you understand ? If it 's not you or me , it 's someone else , and I 'm not gonna sit around and have somebody come in and take over our life 's work . Maybe this is all happening for a reason . If you could just be a little bit more open-minded , we could resume our ... our life ... and our work and our family , together . Julie , we don 't have a life together . I 'm gonna find Ethan , and I 'm gonna shut this thing down . It 's Julie . I think I may have just really screwed up . Molly , you have an incoming call from John . Decline . Molly , you have an incoming call from John . Molly , please pick up . Molly ... I 'm sorry for the pain I 've caused , but I have to tell you something . I 'm going to call Der ... Marko , is there a technical problem ? No , John , just waiting for the light to change . We 've stopped on train tracks . No , John , we 're 20 feet from the train tracks . What ? Marko , switch to manual drive . - Manual drive is offline . - Marko ! Unlock the door ! The door is locked for your safety . Override the safeties , damn it ! Unlock the ... door ! _ Molly Woods , your meds are being dispensed . Dr. Woods , the purpose of this review is to determine whether , following a court-mandated 90-day psych hold , you are ready to be released . It 's been six months since your husband passed away . How 's your time been at our recovery center ? Extremely healing . I am really gonna miss this place . Molly , we 're concerned that you haven 't fully come to terms with the events of last summer . I have . All better . Several drunk and disorderlies . Well , I call that a good time but ... whatever . Burning down your house . Not the whole house . And I have learned my lesson about playing with matches . Never do that when you 're angry . Attacking a Ms. Julie Gelineau with a shovel . Well , she screwed my husband and then had the nerve to show up to his funeral . Now , I think I should be committed if I didn 't smack her . Molly , we know this has been a profoundly difficult year for you . We think you 're not quite ready for reentry . Oh . Okay , now I get it . This isn 't a fair hearing . This is putting a rubber stamp to keep me in a rubber room . Now , I 've done every single thing you people have asked me to do . I 've been a good little girl . I 've taken all my meds . I 've done your-your VR therapy . And you 're still not gonna let me out . Which begs the obvious question : Why does the government want to shut me up so badly ? You believe the government is the reason you 're here ? I do . Sam Barton , your friend and physician , testified that she was concerned about your mental health . Sam Barton ? Please ! She 'd say anything to save her own ass . She confirmed you had abnormal brain scans upon returning from your mission . Now , we know extended time in space can do something to the brain ... Liars . You 're all a bunch of liars ! It 's the board 's recommendation that we extend your hold and reevaluate in 30 days ... that you still pose a serious threat of harm to self and others . That 's ridiculous ! I am not a threat and you know it . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! It 's a cover-up ! And you know it ! Take your hands off of me ! For real ? Richter . Criminal bid 1-1-9-6-4 . Stand by , please . You 're a cop ? Patrol Special . I work by the piece . My number comes up , I can take it or leave it . Does it give good benefits ? I suppose . No bosses , dress code , no company softball games . Confirm ID , please . One-one-nine-four . Pass key , Buffalojump . Good evening , JD . This case may contain sensitive and / or classified information . Can you confirm you are in a private setting ? Yeah . Just ... just me and the four walls , Val . Female victim . Aged 26 years . Suspected homicide . Landlord found the body 47 minutes ago . Yeah . What 's the payout ? $ 20,000 for apprehension and conviction . All right , Val , can you do me a favor ? Give me 20 minutes ? Negative ... I have other bidders standing by . You have 20 seconds to accept or decline . Accept . Would you like a partner ? Kills me you still ask . I 'm a computer . I have to follow the rules . That is how fascism starts . No . No partner . Sending crime scene location to your nav . Please confirm receipt . Yeah . Confirmed . Wait ... is that it ? No . That 's not it . That 's just part of the buildup . It 's like ... tantric sex . What are you talking about ? Friday . I 'm talking about Friday . You have 20 seconds to accept or decline this offer . You 're a son of a bitch . Yeah . But I accept . Friday . Hope you had a day of recovery here at RestWell . As always , breakfast is at 7 : 30 . I saw him the other night , watching TV . There 's some crazy stuff on the news ... Stopped reading the news a long time ago . You hear about that woman ? Her belly , blown open . Oh , freaky . That 's the third one now . Yeah . You should see the photos . I ain 't ever seen anything like it . Was she shot or stabbed or something ? They don 't know . Looked to me like she kind of exploded from the inside ... I mean , there was blood everywhere , like one of those horror movies . That 's just so terrible , just so sad . My cousin sent me this pic . That 's some straight Hannibal Lecter stuff right there . Oh , my God . No one wants to see that , Dave . Look at what Dave just showed me . Ugh . Whoever did that was one sick son of a bitch . What are you looking at ? Nothing , honey . Come on now , Dave . You know I want to know what 's going on out there . No technology , no news . Too much stimuli for you . Let 's get you back up to your room before the Med Bot does her rounds . - Oh ... - Those headaches again ? We 'll run some scans in the morning . Okay . Okay . Oh , Dave ... Dave ... Can you take me back to my room ? Sure , sure . So , does Molly want a bedtime story ? - Yes , I do . - Mm . First ... - Ah ... - Uh-uh . You know I want to know what 's going on out there , Dave . You like scary bedtime stories ? Uh-huh . Hope you don 't get bad dreams . It looks like something tore its way right out of her stomach . All right , that 's enough of that . Okay , well , how about a little bit of this ? Gonna have to take a rain check , Dave . Thanks for the bedtime story . Med Bot , I need potassium trimanganate and glycerol . Patient 429 , those elements are highly combustible . That 's the idea . Fire ! Sector Three ! Emergency evacuation procedure ... go ! Where the hell is Dave ? Hello , Dave . Where would you like to go tonight ? 322 Ivy Road . Maximum speed . 22 miles per hour . We can do better , don 't you think ? Still a work in progress . Well , let 's keep progressing . Where are we ? Uh , working through the ethics algorithms . Still ? Come on , Charlie , software coding is falling behind hardware development . Give me a break . I 'm inventing whole new systems here . I mean , things we didn 't need for Ethan . You need to push your team . - Jawohl , Herr Kommandant . - Stop . They need to know I 'm in charge . Kidding around like that undermines my authority . Okay . All joking will be suspended until further notice . Sorry . I sound like a jackass . Your team is killing it . Really . Jules , I know you 're under a lot of pressure right now . And , whatever , I can be kind of a jackass myself , sometimes . Want to get a drink later ? I 'm buying . Rain check . I 'm late for dinner . Sure . If I counted up all the rain checks , I 'd need a couple umbrellas . You are entering a sealed crime scene . Exit immediately . You move , I shoot . Whatever you 're stealing , put it back . - I 'm not stealing . - Stealing , borrowing ... I 'm not a semantics kind of guy . Look , I 'm with the crime scene c-cleanup service . You know , that ain 't half bad . Except you 're a week early and crime scene scrubbers are Bots ... you know , little aluminum fellas on wheels . Let me go ! Why is it all the good-looking women are crazy ? Well , I could float a few theories . Oh , I bet you could . Hold still . Wow . Dr. Molly Woods . An honest-to-goodness space cadet on a 90-day hold at the RestWell Recovery Center . It 's a rest facility . I needed a vacation . You need a new travel agent . You know , mental patients escape often enough , but they 're not normally former astronauts making a beeline for the closest crime scene . You care to share ? Okay , look ... I think I might know what happened here . I am all ears . Well , can we go somewhere else to chat ? Because they 're gonna be tracking the phone I stole and the car I stole . I hate when that happens . Okay , I know how that sounds . But I am really not a lunatic . Says the lady that broke out of Crazy Acres , stole a phone , stole a car ... and then trespassed onto my crime scene . Field trip is over , Ms. Woods . Look ... please , please , do not let them take me back to that place . Please ! Okay , your victim was pregnant . Preliminary autopsy scans didn 't mention a pregnancy . Hello , Molly . She 's all yours . Check the scans . She was pregnant ... and the other two ladies were pregnant , too ... check it . Steal my phone and my car ? Let go of me ! Come on , let 's move ! Hmm ... Sweetie , I 'm home . Hello , Julie . Hi , Hank . Where is he ? In the den . I brought home some pizza . No , thanks . Well , you have to eat something . When am I going home , Julie ? We talked about this . This is your home now . How you feeling , Molly ? 14 days before my performance review . You screwed me . Would 've been a seven percent pay raise ... roughly 15K a year after taxes . Okay , well ... I 'll talk to ' em ... tell ' em what I did . - It 's time for that rain check . - No . No , no , no . Dave ! What ? Dr. Woods , you have a visitor . Get dressed , please . See you around , Molly . I 'm afraid I don 't understand . That 's a court order ... pretty straightforward . And she 's a material witness in a homicide investigation . I 'm not sure you grasp the gravity of Ms. Wood 's condition . I 'm not gonna ask her to operate heavy machinery . You do realize ... that you are taking an unstable woman into custody . She 's an arsonist , escape artist , prone to violent outbursts . Sounds like my ex-wife . Well , she 's on a prescriptive schedule that 'll require strict supervision . You got it . Blues at 10 : 00 , reds at 7 : 00 . I 'll have her back in 72 hours , no worse for the wear . Molly Woods . After you . I don 't think we 've been properly introduced . JD Richter . How 'd you pull this one off , JD Richter ? Well , let 's just say a judge owed me a favor or three . So look what I found . Prenatal vitamins . In her medicine cabinet . Oh , now , that 's a hell of a clue . Yeah . How 'd you know she was pregnant ? Did you know her ? Look , there 's something much more important going on than this , okay ? The government is trying to shut me up . All right , wait a second . We are ten feet from the rubber squad , Condor , all right ? Let 's just skip the conspiracy theories . I 'm guessing this thing is yours , huh ? Yeah . And listen , you know , you don 't have to worry about me . I 'm stable , sane , and completely clear-headed . Well , that 's good , you 're the only lead I got . Give me a sec . Thanks for the ride , Dave . You are crazy . Maybe a little . But crazy 's all you got . Hey ! Drive fast . What did you do to my car ? ! You want to tell me what the hell this is about ? This isn 't a murder investigation . It 's an invasion . Technology . All it does is separate us . Do you want to get some fresh air ? Sure .

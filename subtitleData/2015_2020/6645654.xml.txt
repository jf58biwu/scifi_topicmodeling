ERICA : Tommy , I have a solution . A way to start again after the H.E.L.E. I call it Gateway . Who are you ? I was Katana Girl . We were part of something special , weren 't we ? Things change , Luke . LUKE : I 'll take care of Malina . You need to get her to a hospital right now . Now that we 've imprisoned the Master of Time and Space , we are ready to put him online .

For those who fear this is the end , I assure you it is anything but . In fact , for those of us here in Gateway , this is just the beginning . Each and every one of you has been handpicked . As promised from the beginning , an invitation to Gateway is indeed an invitation to the future . All of you are now pioneers . The first generation of what will become a new and improved world . ( SCREAMING ) COMPUTER : Greetings , Tommy . Power core active . Quantum sync ... ERICA : The devices you are wearing on your wrists are now active , signifying the launch of what we are calling ( DEVICES BEEPING ) " Project Reborn .

Welcome to the future . ANNOUNCER : Welcome to the new Gateway . This device acts not only as a timepiece , but contains all personal information you will need to navigate Gateway safely and efficiently . ( DOOR WHOOSHES ) All right , you got it ? That must be where they took Otomo . Past here . Do you think Miko 's in there , too ? ( GASPS ) The door ! Safe ! ( CRUNCHING ) Ah ! Computer ! Ren , let it go . Your key . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) COMPUTER : Warning , sedative apparatus disabled . Evo regeneration grid offline . Greenhouse A through Q interface disconnected . Medical scan commencing . Otomo-san ? Otomo-san ! I got him . Go . Evo cognitive functions at 30 % . 40 % . 50 % . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) You found her . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hey ! Hello ? Hello ? No , wait ! Wait ! Come back ! ( GRUNTS ) I was kind of hoping Bennet would end up here , too . There 's no one even guarding the place . LUKE : There 's no one left to guard . Hey , guys , guys . Take a look at that . It 's the first solar flare . We need to take cover . There , come on . Come on , come on . Let 's go ! No , I didn 't come all this way just to hide . Let 's have this discussion inside ! I have to do something ! If that solar flare hits , there won 't be much of a world left when Tommy gets back . The prophecy , your prophecy ... It is not time yet . I have to do something . This is not your fate . It 's mine . I cannot be forgiven for the things that I 've done , but you saved my life , and I have got to believe that there 's a reason for that . Oh , Luke , please ... Don 't . Quentin , no matter what happens , you keep her in here and make sure she gets to that clock tower . What about you , man ? What about you ? What are you doing ? Hey ! No , no , no ! You 're being crazy , man ! Luke ! ( WHOOSHING ) MALINA : Luke ! ( INAUDIBLE ) ( SIZZLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) I got it , the bullet . Nice trick . Told you I could find it . ( FARAH GASPS ) There we go . ( LAUGHS ) There we go . ( PANTING ) Malina ? She 's okay . They headed to Gateway . ( DOOR OPENS ) MAN : Hello ? We need some help . There was a pileup on I-20 . We 've got more injured coming . Where is everyone ? They 're all gone . Please ... My daughter . Looks like we 're staying here . Please , wait . Come back , please . You got to go back now . You got to go back . You need to remember . Who are you ? I 'm you . Me ? What ? How is that possible ? We can be in two places at once . How long have you ... We been in here ? Time has no meaning here , only memories . Memories ? They trick us into perceiving time as a straight line , with a past and a future , but really , time ... Time is a circle . And memories are timeless . Every moment of our life , it exists in this place . Every memory . My memories were erased . Not in here . But you got to think deep , or you , our sister , everyone in the world is gonna die . And we 'll be stuck in this loop forever . Focus on a moment . Our childhood , where we came from . I don 't know . I can 't remember . You already have . Mom , what 's wrong ? Oh , Nathan , come here . The world 's about to change . REPORTER : ( ON TV ) Tonight in New York 's Central Park , the shocking moment caught on tape as a young woman jumps from a Ferris wheel and miraculously heals in front of rolling cameras . ( CROWD SCREAMING ) My name is Claire Bennet . This is attempt number ... ( CHUCKLES ) I guess I 've kind of lost count . REPORTER : Rapid cellular regeneration , with some experts calling this a leap forward in human evolution . And she may not be alone . TOMMY : Who is she ? She 's your mother . TOMMY : I don 't understand . ANNE : I know , baby . It 's time you knew the truth . TOMMY : Do you ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary ? ANNE : The comic book you love-- - TOMMY : 9th Wonders ? ANNE : You have more in common with your favorite character than you think . TOMMY : Hiro Nakamura ? EMILY : You are different , Tommy . You 'll always be different . The boy is like his uncle and his great-grandfather . He can absorb powers . My name 's Hiro Nakamura , former Master of Time and Space . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) I love you . Be brave . You 're the best son a dad could ever have . TOMMY : I 'm ready . I 'm ready to save the world . ( RUMBLING ) What is that ? Satellite debris from the first flare . We 're running out of time . We 'd better get you to the clock tower . ( DOOR OPENS ) MALINA : My grandmother 's vision was of me under the clock tower , not hiding inside it . QUENTIN : Malina , the debris will kill you . You can wait it out in here . It 's a pretty solid structure . ( RUMBLING ) Phoebe ? ( GRUNTING ) Phoebe , no ! Phoebe , no ! Quentin ? Quentin ? No ! No ! Damn it ! ( WHIMPERING ) Quentin ! Phoebe ! ( YELLING ) Phoebe ! Let go of me ! QUENTIN : Phoebe ! ( GRUNTING ) Phoebe ! ( GRUNTING ) Let me go ! Phoebe ! Stop it ! Phoebe , it 's over . Why are you helping her ? Erica 's coming back . No , she 's not . She was never taking us back with her . Okay ? She used us . She used you to get what she wanted . No . No , that 's not true . Erica made you into a monster . She made you into a monster , Phoebe . And I let it happen . And I 'm sorry , but we were wrong . ( RUMBLING ) ( GLASS SHATTERS ) You 're lying ! ( SCREAMS ) This isn 't you , Phoebe ! Just come with me . We can fix this . There 's only one thing left to fix . ( RUMBLING ) ( SCREAMING ) Don 't do this ! ( GUN CLICKING ) No ! Phoebe ! ( SCREAMS ) Oh , no , no ! I don 't understand . Why doesn 't she know you ? ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) COMPUTER : Evo regeneration grid online . Power station is operational again . I found the source of the problem . Sedative apparatus engaged . ( GROANING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SWORD CLATTERS ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( CHUCKLES ) So , my boyfriend 's stuck inside your video game . Erica Kravid forced me to put him into a prison of my own design . Now someone must enter the game and free him . Someone who knows Evernow as well as its maker . I 'm just a gamer . You 've spent hundreds of hours in Evernow , the best player I 've ever seen , and most importantly , you have the heart of a warrior . That 's why I chose you . Now ... ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( FLARE WHOOSHING ) It 's time . ( WHOOSHING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( BOTH EXCLAIM ) ( BOTH YELL ) ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( YELLING ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING CONTINUES ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( FLOOR CRACKING ) ( YELLS ) ( GROANS ) ( YELLING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) TOMMY : When I was , like , seven , these people took me to this place because of my power . I remember a room filled with toys and stuff . ( TOY ROARING ) No windows . It 's kind of hazy . No . No , I don 't want to see this one ! ( DOOR OPENS ) Nathan ? I 'd like you to meet Malina , your sister . Do you two ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary ? I know , because I have dreamt about you since before you were born . Now that your abilities have matured , we need to test the symbiotic bond you share . Don 't be frightened . I promise you both you won 't remember any of this . Shouldn 't Noah be hereto see this ? His plan depended on him not knowing any of this . We stick to that . Now take each other 's hands . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPING ) Stop ! This again ? I know what to do ! You 've got to go back . Who are you ? I 'm you . Me ? What ? How is that possible ? We can be in two places at once . ( MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) No , wait . I don 't understand . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( MIKO GRUNTS ) ( MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BLADES CLASHING ) ( BANGING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( CRACKLING ) Whoa . ( GUNS COCKING ) Hello , Tommy . ( GRUNTING ) Go back . Go . ERICA : Did you really think you could escape without me knowing ? It 's over , Tommy . My name is Nathan . And you can 't stop someone who can stop time . Time travel , it 's a bitch . ( CHUCKLING ) The future we 're standing in exists only because the H.E.L.E. happened . The moment you go back and stop it , all of this , all of us will cease to exist . So which world are you going to choose ? The one with your sister , or the one with your girlfriend and your mother and the thousands of innocent people that you brought here ? ( WHIMPERS ) Let me make it easier for you . Time 's running out , and one of these worlds has to die . You can 't save both . You can 't be in ... Two places at once . Even Hiro Nakamura couldn 't do that . I can . Hiro Nakamura prepared me my entire life for this . And now I 've had an eternity in Evernow to practice , thanks to you . No . That 's impossible ! ( MALINA SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) It 's about time . It 's too strong ! Come on . You can share my power . Come on . Come on ! ( GRUNTING ) ( BOTH GRUNT ) I don 't understand . It 's not working . ( BOTH GROANING ) What 's happening to us ? It wasn 't supposed to be like this . Something 's wrong . Let go ! Let go ! I can 't ! Let go ! ( YELLS ) ( SCREAMING ) TOMMY : I 've got to go back . ( YELLS ) Now , take each other 's hands . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) They 're going to die ! Stop them ! ( YELLING ) It 's okay . You 're safe now . No ! He 's dead . It didn 't work . They will die if they come together . They need a conduit . Someone between them willing to sacrifice themselves . ( WHOOSHING ) Now that your abilities have matured , we need to test the symbiotic bond you share . Take each other 's hands . ( BOTH SCREAMING ) They are dying ! Stop them ! ( SCREAMING ) It 's okay . You 're safe now . He 's dead . They will die if they come together . They need a conduit . Someone between them willing to sacrifice themselves . It all makes sense now . There was a third person in my dreams , a faceless figure . Who ? Who is that going to be ? ANGELA : I think I know exactly who it was . ( ZAPPING ) I tried everything . I went back 1,000 times , but we always failed . We needed you . So I went back to ... You saved me . I would have died in that storm . Yes . I 'm sorry , but you had to see this . I followed the tiniest thread , just like my dad taught me . The smallest butterfly . Save you , save the world . What do we do ? Take me back to Gateway , to the end of the world . Malina ! Grandpa ? It 's okay . I 've got you . There 's got to be another way . You two have your destiny . This is mine . It 's time to save the world . ( YELLING ) ( BULLET RICOCHETING ) ( GASPS ) ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) No ! ( YELLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) No . No , no , no , no . Hey . You 're gonna be okay . Gonna get you to the hospital . So , so sorry . ( GROANS ) I am so proud of you both . So proud . No . No , no , no , no . No , no . Hey , hey , hey . ( CRYING ) No ! No , please . ( SOBBING ) No ! Please . Can 't keep me here forever . I have rights . Here 's the thing , Quentin . We know you were there . You saw how it went down . These Evos save the whole world and don 't ask for a thing in return . ( SCOFFS ) No one does that . So the question is , who are they ? You want to know who they are ? They 're somebody 's sister , somebody 's brother , daughter , son , grandchild . See , you people ... You people want them to be extraordinary , but they 're not . They couldn 't be more ordinary . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) The only thing extraordinary is that they got a chance to be heroes . A tad excessive , maybe ? When are you guys gonna let me come fight crime with you ? What kind of uncle would I be if I took you with me ? I don 't know . Best uncle ever ? QUENTIN : They didn 't think about themselves . They just did the right thing . And now they just want to be left alone ... Oh . ... so they can scratch out some small purpose that can give their life some meaning , community , hope , like all the rest of us . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) And when that darkness rolls in , and it will , they 'll be here , ready for the call , up for the task , without us even having to ask . MALINA : What is it ? I don 't know . QUENTIN : See , this is just the beginning , man , an awakening . And now my eyes are open , wide open . They were here to save us . So you want to know who they are ? Look in the mirror . They 're you , they 're me , on our best day . So there you go . That 's who they are . ( SCHOOL BELL RINGS ) How was your first day ? I found this . On the card is twins . When I touched it , I got this feeling like someone was watching me . You know what this is , don 't you ? It 's a message from your father , Malina . It means he 's coming back for you and your brother . And this time , no one will be able to protect you .

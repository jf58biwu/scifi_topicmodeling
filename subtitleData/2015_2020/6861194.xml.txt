 [ Pidge screaming ] What just happened ? - I don 't know , but we gotta stay together . - [ both screaming ] [ both screaming ] - [ beeping ] - [ loud crash ] [ water bubbling ] - [ alarm blaring ] - [ groaning ] - Hunk , you okay ? Hunk ? - [ retching ] - I 'm fine . - You just threw up , didn 't you ? Yeah . You would too if you got sucked out of a wormhole at light speed , then crash-landed on an ice planet and ended up underwater . - That is what happened to me ! - Oh , right . My main system is down . The crash must have screwed it up . Does yours work ? I 'm on reserve power . My lion 's pretty much dead in the water . [ groans ] This situation 's bad enough , Hunk . Don 't make it worse with puns . [ Hunk ] I 'm just shocked we hit a planet . I thought Pidge said space was 90 % empty . [ Lance ] Well , apparently , Pidge 's science is wrong . [ Hunk ] We need to contact the others and get back to group immediately . Hello , anyone ? This is Hunk and Lance of the Yellow and Blue Lions . - They know the color of our lions ! - Oh , right . Okay , yeah . I always forget that . My bad . [ groans ] We gotta check for damage and get these lions running . - Copy that . - Oh , good . The Blue Lion 's coming back online now . Welcome back , beautiful . Uh ... Hunk , did ... did you just see something swim by ? What ? No . No way ! This is going to sound crazy , but I think I just saw a mermaid . Oh , boy . Okay , how hard did you bang your head when we hit the planet ? Dude , I 'm serious ! [ gasps ] Look ! There it is again ! Hey , come here ! Where you going ? Hey , slow down ! Lance , knock it off . We have to stay focused and get to the others ... - You 're outside of your lion . Great . - I know we have to find the others . I 'm just saying maybe this thing can help . Also , it 's a mermaid . A mermaid ! Come on , let 's find it . No . No way . Nope . Not going out there . Okay , you stay here , by yourself , in the dark , all alone in a lion that 's out of commission . Don 't leave me ! Come on ! I can 't believe this ! We 're really chasing a mermaid . [ giggling ] Hey , wait , wait , wait ! We 're friendly ! [ both gasp ] [ both ] Whoa ! - Hello . - [ both scream ] Welcome to my village . Here , all are safe and warm . [ both scream ] Please , do not startle our guests . I am Florona . The almighty Queen Luxia , keeper of our land , would love to meet with you . Wait . How did your queen know we were here ? Queen Luxia knows all . Lance , I know this mermaid thing is a dream of yours , but we really gotta go . We will , big guy , we will , but let 's meet this queen first . Besides , maybe she can help us . And , if I just happen to find the future Mrs. Blue Lion , well , then that is all right with me . Space travelers , I am Queen Luxia . I welcome you to our village as honored guests . The honor 's all ours . I 'm La-a-a-ance . [ grunts ] Uh , Mrs. Queen , Your Honor , Your Excellence , I 'm Hunk , and me and my buddy here , we crash-landed on your lovely planet , but we really need to get back in touch with our friends who are in space . Would you possibly have any way of doing that ? Hunk , Lance , I can solve all of your problems . - Here , we are all safe and warm . - You use magic , don 't you ? I bet this castle 's a ship . This castle is a ship , am I right ? - Just don 't say anything if I 'm right . - Here , I 've brought you these . The bubble coral will provide you with all the air you need . Whoa-ho-ho ! Thank you , Fish Queen . Huh . Cool . And rest assured , your space vessels will be well protected . Now , please , follow me . What is that ? That is the giver of life to our people , the Baku Garden . When the waters froze over , we were forced to live down here . The garden provides us the warmth and food we need to survive . Because of it , we are taken care of . Here , all are safe and warm . [ mermaids giggling ] [ giggling ] Your Royalness- - [ clears throat ] if I may , this food is amazing . It 's even better than Balmeran cave bugs . I 'm glad you enjoy it . It was picked fresh from the Baku Garden . And I hope you enjoy the entertainment . [ sultry dance music playing ] Whoa . So , about us getting in contact with our friends ... how can you help us ? Please , let 's discuss that after the dance . Whoa , this dance is amazing . It 's the ... It 's the most amazing thing I 've ever seen . I 'm glad you enjoy it . Put your mind at ease . Let your consciousness drift like the tide . Yes , I will do that . I ... Were- - Weren 't we just talking about something ? You were just telling me how much you like it here , how much you wanted to stay forever . Oh , that 's right . Here , we are all safe and warm . Lance , I think we should stay here forever . Okay . [ snoring ] I don 't need pants . I 'm a mermaid . Huh ? Who are ... ? [ snoring ] [ snoring ] Leave him . We have to get out of here . [ sighs , smacks lips ] Hello ? - Good morning . Where am I ? - He 's awake . Why am I blindfolded ? Is this a game ? [ gasps ] I like games . Wait , where am I ? Why am I blindfolded ? Is this a game ? I hate games ! [ grunts ] It 's okay . You were mind-swished , but now we want to- - Kill me ? Think again ! [ groans ] - [ grunts ] - [ screaming ] Wait ! Come back ! [ screams ] [ screaming repeatedly ] Huh ? [ laughing ] Aw ! [ screaming ] - Don 't hurt me ! - Please , we are not here to hurt you . We brought you here to ask for your help . I am Plaxum . - Blumfump . - Swirn . Are you saying names , or is this some kind of weird spell you 're putting on me ? We believe you are our savior . You guys think I 'm your savior ? What do you want with me ? The queen is mind-swishing everyone , controlling their thoughts . We believe you can stop her . [ snoring ] [ moans ] Lance ? Lance , you around ? Lance ? Is everything all right ? I can 't find Lance . Also , there 's a hole in our wall . There was a break-in . Those cave-dwellers must have taken him . Them again ? What should we do ? Those meddling mermaids are harmless , but the air-breather could prove troublesome if he doesn 't fall back under our control . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Who needs to fall under our control ? Is Lance gone ? - We gotta find Lance . - And we will . Don 't worry your little mind about it . But first , we need to sit down and eat , talk , clear our heads . No , I 'm not really sure if I can eat right now . If Lance has been taken ... [ moans ] Oh , boy . That ... That is good , though . See ? That 's all you need . Here , we are all safe and warm . Okay . They are going to come . We must destroy what remains of their kind and bring Lance under our control . But first , Florona , you were in charge of watching the air-breathers . So , now , it is time for you to take a swim in the garden . Yes , My Queen . Wait . Wait a minute . Okay . You 're trying to tell me the queen is brainwashing people ? But she 's so safe and warm . [ Swirn ] What do you remember from yesterday ? I remember we crashed , saw the mermaids and the village , then we had dinner , and then , uh ... we , uh ... You can 't remember because you were under her control . Our theory is , the queen controls minds by using her voice to strike certain head switches in your ear pan . And her magnetic stare locks on to your eye-to-brain pathway plug . Plus , her mind-control sonar is always broadcasting through the waters . Bong ! Bong ! Bong ! She trains her people to use hypnotic movements to lull you under her control . I do remember a dancer . Good , because I haven 't finished my picture for that one . But you see , she was infecting your brain ! Holy crow ! I had a mind-controlling brain infection ! [ yelps ] [ Plaxum ] Sit . [ Blumfump ] The entire village is under the queen 's mind control . The only reason we aren 't is because we wear these jellyfish that hide our brains from her powers . It 's like we have no brains whatsoever . You can 't control what doesn 't exist . Right . Of course . - Our heads are completely empty . - Yeah , I get it . Many years ago , the queen froze over the surface by blocking the thermal vents . She forced everyone to the depths , where she began to brainwash them . They became her prisoners . - What size ? - Eight and seven-eighths aquameters . But what 's the point ? Why mind-control the mermaids ? - To kill them ! - Really ? Well , we don 't know that for sure , but hundreds of mermaids have disappeared and never come back . Goodbye , Florona . It is time to return to the giver of life . [ Swirn ] We 've tried to take out the queen , but failed several times . And every attempt depletes our numbers . Now , there are only three of us left . Without you , there is no hope . - Found one ! - What do you want from me ? We saw the mer-cat you came in . We think it can stand up against the queen and her forces . But first , you 'll need one of these . Now , they sting pretty bad and don 't smell great . If my theory is correct , the smelliest ones block the most mind-control rays . - Are you a scientist ? - No . Also , they can sometimes make your face swell , and you might experience hearing loss . Would you just put it on , already ? - [ screams ] It burns ! - That means it 's working ! [ groaning ] [ mumbling ] So , what 's the plan ? Here 's what Blumfump came up with . This is you . You act like you 're still thought-swirled and get past the guards . Get your mer-cat and grab the queen . We 'll mount a full-scale attack on the castle and free the people . Then , I 'll be a hero . [ high voice ] " Oh , Lance , you 're so handsome ! " [ normal voice ] " And modest . " [ high voice ] " Oh , thank you for saving us . Can I kiss you ? " [ normal voice ] " Maybe just a little . " [ kissing noises ] Well , now , you 're just making a tree kiss a turtle . That 's a turtle ? But there 's an actual turtle right here . We needed the turtle to play the wall . If your acting fails you , this holds three doses of antidote to use on the guards . It should interrupt the queen 's mind-control long enough for you to escape . I don 't think I 'll be needing this . I missed 14 days of the third grade for a stomachache I never really had . Hello , mer-guards ! Isn 't everything just so safe and warm here ? Anyway , I 'm off to my lion- - Oh , come on ! [ groans ] I had a feeling you 'd come for your vessel . Servant , take Lance to the Baku Garden . [ gasps ] Hunk ? Hey , buddy , it 's me ! Snap out of it ! It 's Lance ! [ groans ] [ yells ] Darn it ! [ grunting ] Everyone , capture him ! [ grunting ] [ yells ] [ groans ] [ screams , whimpers ] [ laughs , grunts ] [ screams ] [ groans ] [ grunting ] Hunk , please ! I don 't want to hurt you ! Must keep Queen safe and warm . [ grunts ] [ squeaking ] [ groans ] [ whimpering ] [ grunting ] [ moans ] Whoa ! Whoa ! Where am I ? What am I doing ? Is that a jellyfish on your head ? Hunk , you 've been mind-controlled by the queen and you 're trying to kill me . - Oh , really ? Sorry . My bad . - We 're kind of in the middle of a battle . - So , I 'm going to need your help . - Got it . [ Lance ] Oh ! [ Hunk ] Uh ... - Uh ... Uh ... - [ gasps ] - [ grunts ] - Huh ? [ grunting ] [ grunting ] - Now , who are these weirdos ? - Those weirdos are with us . Come , we must hurry to your mer-cats . [ growls ] - [ Lance ] You hanging on ? - Yes ! Let 's go ! - What 's the plan ? - We need to grab the queen and take her to an ice prison Blumfump built , where her mind-control powers will be trapped because of the thick ice and the jellyfish . - Okay , who 's that ? - It 's Plaxum . Just go with it . [ Hunk ] There she is ! [ grunting ] - [ grunting ] - [ groans ] [ Lance ] Got her ! [ groans ] Where am I ? What 's going on ? What 's going on is you 're not mind-controlling these people anymore , Your Majesty . What ? Mind-control ? Me ? No ! Please , my people are in danger ! You must go back ! - What 's going on ? - [ Plaxum ] Nothing ! It 's a ruse . - Are you sure ? - I wasn 't controlling anyone . [ gasps ] The Baku ! - She 's lying ! - I 'm not . Please ! The last thing I remember is that organism in the garden falling from space . I went to inspect it . I thought it was a plant . [ Hunk ] Wait a second . We 've been eating that plant . And it 's delicious ! It 's so safe and warm . A-ha ! Mind-swishing ! It was the plant the whole time . And the queen was the first one to be mind-controlled . But why ? The Baku has been harvesting us all . We are its food source . No way ! I think she 's telling the truth . Look out the window . [ roars ] You two get somewhere safe . Okay , Hunk , change of plans . The queen is actually good and that thing is bad . Let 's take it out . [ roars ] [ yelling ] That thing 's too quick for me . I can 't hit it ! - My lion 's not very good in water . - Really ? My lion 's moving better than ever . There 's something about fighting underwater that 's making me feel extra quick and powerful . - I think I know how to stop that thing . - How ? We gotta stop shooting where the creature is and start shooting where the creature 's gonna be . [ growling ] I got it ! [ groaning , panting ] [ roaring ] [ Lance laughs ] Now , the hunter becomes- - - Oh , no , he 's free ! - [ yelling ] [ screams , grunts ] [ roars ] [ creature screams ] - What ? - [ electronic beeping ] Here goes nothing ! [ roars ] [ screaming ] [ Lance ] This place is coming down ! Let 's get out of here ! [ Hunk ] Dude , you just dropped a sonic boom on him ! [ Lance ] So , Blumfump , the jellyfish , the magnetic stare , the hypnotic dance ... - You got it all wrong . It was the food . - Well , I did say they were theories . Mer-science isn 't always about getting the right answer . I want to thank you all for what you 've done . You 've freed my people , and I will do all I can to protect that freedom . I vow to be the voice of my people . I beg of you to help . - Will you be my advisors ? - Of course , Your Highness . I have some great ideas . Have you ever heard of electricity ? And I wanted to personally thank you , Lance . - Mwah . - [ groans ] Finally , I can remove this thing . Whoa ! [ moaning ] Queen Luxia , the reason we came here in the first place was to see if you could help us find our friends . Of course . It has been many years since we have activated the energy beacon , but perhaps it is time to rebuild our civilization and reach out to interstellar travelers once again . Activate energy beacon ! [ Pidge ] I see the beacon ! There is a mer-cat in our system that appears to be heading our way . [ Hunk ] It 's the Green Lion ! See , Hunk ? I told you they could help us . Now , the next time I go swimming after a mermaid , I hope you won 't be complaining the whole time . Lesson learned .

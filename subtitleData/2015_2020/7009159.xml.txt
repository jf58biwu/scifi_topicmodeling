 What is that godforsaken thing ? Is it harming Sarah ? Apparently , Neolutionists get them like voluntarily . If you had one to study , would that be helpful ? Oh , Jesus , what is that ? I think that 's what we need . I 'm glad you 're forming a bond with the child . Charlotte was cloned from you , you know ? How do you even know she 's your sister ? She 's probably a Neolutionist plant . This means a lot to me . I 'm not just gonna drop all my shit 'cause you 're short a sidekick . Then you can piss off . Why place it in the jaw ? I don 't know , you tell me . - Proximity to the brain ? - Jesus . I need to get in touch with MK . - What did you find out ? - She wouldn 't tell me . Was it something to do with those implant things ? - Beth said to hide . - Wait ! Mika ! Sarah . New software . Crafty , but anonymous . Look , Niki , another puzzle piece . See , Niki ? We 're getting closer . Never forget . This is how you treat someone who saved your skin ? We have no intention of trusting you with the location of our safe house . Is all this really necessary ? Hmm . Chef 's kitchen . Is anyone hungry ? Kendall not joining us , no ? Kira ? As long as you 're here , they will be safely somewhere else . We 've got one bit of business only . You said you could help me get this bot out of my face . Well , not me personally . But chin up . Susan Duncan 's alive . If we find her , surely she 'll have the answer to your situation . And what is it you want ? What he wants is to rescue Rachel . What can I say ? She pierced this armored heart . Shall we breakfast ? The message you got from Rachel , I assume you can 't trace it . No , but you have a source who could . Do we ? Someone tipped you the Neos were in Iceland . Someone deep , or able to get deep . Am I right ? Share your source and we 'll both have what we need . - Insulated and fashionable . - Yeah , that 's Alison for ya ' . - Ready ? - Mmm-hmm . Oh , God . - Ooh , that 's the head of Dyad . - He never gave me a raise . Not once . Who 's the science now , bitch ? - Oh , boy , look at that . - Yeah . So , the tumor is living , but the surrounding tissue 's necrotic . It was feeding off him . Buried down there in the cold dirt under the Hendrix garage . Oh , God . Alison and Donnie are total psychos , but this is a goldmine . Look , you can see the bot , it 's right there . I 'll biopsy the tumor , run a cell assay . - Okay . - Then we open it up . Ah , la frittata . Go-to brunch for lazy lovers . Rachel 's a foodie , too . And only a fluffy frittata will she abide . And here was I thinking psychopaths incapable of genuine human connection . Nonsense . She seduced me , you know ? Yeah , that figures . Rachel 's message , its origins masked by redirection through a series of proxy servers . And why do you think my contact can help with that ? Let me convince them . Felix is here . Fee ? Why ? Family meeting , love . I 'll reach out to my source , but you don 't get access . Benjamin , will you take Ferdinand and his frittata into the back room ? He can eat alone . No need for that . Two plates , Benjamin ? You know , I don 't think it 's as bad as you think . It is . It 's terrible . My name is mud at Glendale Community . No , no , not true . You don 't need them . We 've always talked about doing our own musical revue . Oh , Alison , I would love to . ♪ Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ Superstar ♪ ♪ Do you think ♪ ♪ you 're what they say you are ... ♪ Shh ! ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ ♪ Don 't get me wrong ♪ ♪ Don 't you get me wrong now ♪ Oh , I have to go . - Hot yoga , ten minutes . - No . Bye . ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ Okay , see you soon . - Bye . - Bye . ♪ Don 't you get me wrong ♪ What the hell is wrong with you ? You don 't recognize me ? It 's Trina , Beth . I specifically told you to drop it . And you went back to Club Neolution . You went to Lifespring Fertility . I didn 't ... I didn 't know . I told you I was a carrier in confidence . Why couldn 't you just let it go ? Wait ! Um , do you ... Do you wanna grab a coffee ? Cops . You think you can just fix everything with a cup of coffee ? Stay away from me ! I don 't know why you didn 't tell me . Well , you were very busy with your bio-sister . If you had told me that you had some kind of a Neolutionist implant in your face Okay , now the air has been cleared . Sarah needs us right now . Felix , it 's absolutely fine for you to get to know Adele , but slowly , and you have to keep her clear of all of this . Yeah , fine , of course . Fine . I hope you find what you 're looking for . Now , Cosima is analyzing the other bot , and when she ... Hey , Alison , you 're on speaker with S and Felix . I don 't want to talk about Dr. Leekie . I bet you don 't . Right now , I have something else . Who 's that ? She just accosted me at Aroma Cafe . She thought I was Beth . Isn 't that the same girl that we were looking for at Club Neo ? She was upset . She said that Beth apparently investigated some IVF clinic she went to . Lifespring Fertility ? Right , and what 's that got to do with the bot implants ? She said she was a carrier , so maybe she has one of those things in her . Well , could you find out some more ? Maybe start with the clinic ? Sarah , I have budgets to review . I 'm really more of an idea person . Jesus Christ , Alison ! Just pull your weight for once , please ! Go to the clinic . Hey , it 's fine . Alison , I 'll help . I 'll help you . I 'll ... I 'll go with you . Thank you . Well , I guess I have my orders . Call you in a bit , Felix . Hey . Well , would you look at that . It 's a collage of babies . Yes , very cuddling . - Mmm . - Yes , see ? Do you think we could maybe , um ... Oh , I am making mess again . No , it 's not that . It 's Alison . I 'm not in the crafts room . No , no , I know . I know . Urn ... Listen , you probably didn 't know this , but before we adopted Oscar and Gemma , Alison and I tried to have our own kids . This was difficult for you . Yeah , very . It was the most difficult time of my life . But it was harder for Alison . She is jealous and angry because me having babies , and bringing the police ? No , no . Well , the police , yeah , maybe a little bit . We just need to tiptoe . Try not to set her off . You 'll get used to it . Sorry . Good talk . Hey , honey . Uh , yeah , sorry . You want me to meet you where ? - Hey . - Hey . Did MK get back to you ? After I told her about that implant in your jaw ? Yeah . That 's what this is about , isn 't it ? Unless it 's a booty call . She 's inside . - She 's here ? - She said just you . Don 't steal anything . Hello ? MK ? - Hello ? - Here , Sarah . You have three minutes . I need to know what these implants do . You knew Beth was investigating them . Yes if she knew , she didn 't tell me . Well , I need help to get them out . You know Susan Duncan , yeah ? Yes , of course . She was one of our creators . Died September 1st , 1991 . Lab fire . Except she 's still alive . She 'll know how to get this implant out . This is a message from Rachel . Apparently , Susan 's got her captive . Rachel ? I need you to trace it , find out where they are . Rachel contacted you ? No . Someone we trust . - Who ? - That 's my business , all right ? I 'm so sick of pissing around . I need this thing out of my face . I 'm going straight to the top . Show me the specifics . Put it in the USB port . If I show you this , I want to meet in person . I 'll put you in danger . We 're all in danger , MK . I 'll trace it , and meet you in an hour at Beth 's . Fitting . Okay . That is Lifespring Fertility , and this is everything I 've learned about the place . Personnel profiles , services , floor plans . Great ' yob , hon . Clear , concise , color-coordinated . - Thank you . - So , let me sort this . We 're going to pose as prospective parents to determine if this is a Neolutionist front ? I 've already booked your appointment and these are your IDs . - Julian Gray ? - Yeah . Yeah . And Douglas Andrews . Okay ? Oh , this is good . Did you use the new laminator ? Mmm-hmm . And these are real people with real medical records in case of a background check , okay ? Any sign of trouble , you get out . Wait , where 's yours ? Beth 's already been in there . I can 't go in . Okay , then , who 's the couple ? Oh , God , Donnie . Oh . Stop it , I said . - Hi , Douglas and Julian for Dr. Laing . - Hi . - Great . IDs , please . - Yes , of course . - Right here . - Thank you . It 's a terrible picture . - Just a moment . - Thank you . Oh , Lord and butter , Donnie . Stop chewing the scenery . What the bloody hell are you doing ? I 'm playing the part , darling . No , darling , you 're mincing . I don 't know what that means . Donnie , do you have any gay friends ? - No . - Yes , you do . Science commonly holds the belief that 5 % to 10 % of your male friends are gay . Not in Bailey Downs . Especially in Bailey Downs . The point is , you can 't tell , so don 't act gay . Okay . Okay , so while you 're waiting for the doctor , I 'm just gonna get you started on some paperwork and a sperm sample . So , who 's going to be the father ? I am . I guess we 'll just test you both . - Okay . Great . - Sure . That 's a lot of sperm . Okay . Oh . Ah . Thank you . Bad Puppy . My favorite . - Here is your sample cup . - Right . For the , urn , sperm . Thanks , Jill . You 're coming along fine , Portia . Make sure you take your vitamins . Portia Grossman 's pregnant ? No way . No . No , no , no . The Grossmans gave up on IVF years ago . We discussed adoption with them . I know , honey , but she 's five or six months along , easy . You let me deal with Portia . Is there anything else you need ? I 'm in this little room all by myself , and I need to , you know ? Masturbate ? Well , I think I could use a little ... Air Italia to help me along . Donnie , I 'm in a public place . I know , but you asked me what I need , and , um , that 's what I need , Mrs. Hendrix . Sir , you have to put on your seat belt . Hold on , hold on . Uh ... Si , I know , Ma 'am , but , um ... Well , I 'm having trouble doing up the buckle . Take a look ? Si , ooh , it 's a grande , molto duro . Very duro . You best uh , come with me to the lavatory . Please take me to the lavatory . Is that your leaning tower ? It 's not leaning any more . I got two spicy meatballs for you , baby . So spicy ! Ooh ! Oh , it is so tight in this airplane lavatory . - I 'm arriving ! - Si ! I 'm landing ! Oh ! Oh , no , no . Unreal . Okay ... No scolex . No cerebral ganglion . It 's got a synthetic core . I 'm not even sure we could say it 's alive . God . The question is what does it do ? And why did Leekie have one ? She started showing symptoms three weeks ago . I can read , thank you . And is she the youngest subject to develop symptoms ? She is . - She doesn 't know , does she ? - No . And has Susan considered immunosuppressive therapy for her ? That treatment induced rapid onset in Jennifer Fitzsimmons . It was torture . Yes , but Charlotte is prepubescent . Her hormone levels are lower , and her autoimmune response might be easier to ... To control . I 'll bring it up with Susan . Look , Niki , Susan Duncan . Guardian of Rachel . A ghost all these years , like me . Where are you hiding ? Ping , ping , Ping - Rachel 's hidden deep . Who is she reaching out to ? You ? So you are Ferdinand . Who is this mysterious source of Sarah 's ? Insider ? Outsider ? I 've been racking my brains . Biscuit ? I admire you , Siobhan . I 'd like a family of my own someday . I 've squirreled a little away . Enough to recover by the seaside in style . Just Rachel and I. Bide our time , before a slow , steady climb back to power . Interesting definition of family . All our dreams rest with Sarah now , don 't they ? MK ? I 'm here . MK ? You said you 'd meet me in person . - He 's Topside . - What ? Rachel 's contact , he did their wet work , their cleaning . - Is he your source ? - Yeah , I made a decision . Sometimes you have to work with people you don 't like . No , we don 't . No , we don 't . Look , Mika , I will do anything . I 'll deal with anyone to get this implant out of my face . - Did you find Susan Duncan ? - We ' re finished . I can 't trust you now . Oh , sorry . Alison ? Portia ! Oh , no , what 's wrong ? Oh . - Oh , sweetie . - Can we talk ? So we wanted to try one more time but the doctor just told me , " No go . " Oh , Ali , I 'm so sorry . Did you and Jacob , forgive me , but did you try something special ? Did you do some , I don 't know , new technology or ... No ? I mean , I 'd do anything . I would ... - I 'd pay anything . - Ali ... Oscar and Gemma are such amazing kids . Oh , yes , and I love them so much , I really do . I just ... You know , I 'm getting older and everybody 's pregnant , and I just want to have my own baby . Ali ... You know what ? Maybe you should go back in there . See Dr. Bosch . Ask for the Brightborn treatments . - Okay ? - Okay ! Thank you . And are you married ? Yes , though some of us don 't always wear our wedding rings . It 's because some of us don 't need our rings to feel secure in our relationship . Well , we should have the test results in a few days . Urn , do you have an egg donor in mind ? - Not yet . - Yes . - We are still narrowing it down . - Yeah . You know , we should tell you , too , that we are thrilled to be working with you . And we 're both very open to any kind of emerging technologies . Well , you two are healthy young men . I doubt you 'll have any problems conceiving . Dr. Bosch , we were told to ask for you specifically . Oh ? And to ask about the Brightborn treatments . How 'd you hear about Brightborn ? - From a very satisfied customer . - Mmm-hmm . Jill , could you bring in some Brightborn packages ? - Hey - - Hey - MK didn 't show . If MK shut you down , I 'm sure she had good cause . I 'm out of options , Dizzy . I need you to help me find her . You keep banging on my door asking for favors . You ever think about what I might want ? All right , what ? I need to know exactly what 's going on between you and this twin of yours . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . - Why ? - I have my reasons . I 've got people wrapped up in this , too . Okay , fine . Clones . We 're clones . Jesus . Genetic Identicals . How many others are there out there in this little experiment ? Twenty-two that we know of including MK . Nine of us still living . - Do you believe me ? - I don 't know . Well , true or not , it makes for a great story . Now , listen , I 've met with MK three times in person ... and each time she had different plates on her car . - What 's that about ? - Exactly . I cracked the DMV , ran those plates , and wouldn 't you know it , but they 're all defunct . What 's that tell you ? She 's got access to scrapped cars ? She once told me she worked as a night watchman . Three scrap yards in the city . That one 's closest to Beth 's . Who 's Beth ? Save that for later . Listen , you 're gonna want me to come with ya ' . Why would I want that ? Given the right circumstances , I think she could be dangerous . Little science babies , forgive me . I did not know to feed you liquid nitrogens . But your twins are in my belly . And when they are old , I will tell them all about you and our adventures . Goodbye , family Hendrick . There . That 's gotta be it . What , this thing ? If she 's here , I 'm sure she already knows we 're here . Mika ? Mika ! Ugh , screw this . Whoa , whoa , whoa . What ... A little messier than my usual approach . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait , wait , wait . What ? What ? Look at this . See the mat ? It 's a pressure plate bomb . You step on that , the whole place goes up . Jesus . Kinda makes you wonder what she 's hiding . Herself . Be careful ! We need to find whatever she knows about a doctor called Susan Duncan . She can remove the bot . Password . Yeah . I 'll need a few minutes . MK . The pigment is coming along . A few weeks , the tech will be invisible . How are you feeling , Charlotte ? Why do you keep asking that ? Another message . Will you please go play in your room , Charlotte ? Maybe someday I 'll be allowed to visit you there . Yours is nicer . I am willing to consider immunosuppressive therapy for her . You 're no closer to finding the original then , are you ? There is one other option for Charlotte . Do you know what it is ? She 's the youngest subject to fall ill . Untreated , her data-set could be of value to the rest of us . Including Ira . And what would you do ? Let the disease advance , or intervene ? Is this a test ? It 's a decision . One of many we 'd have to make every day . MK . I 'm in . You said she was tracking someone named Susan Duncan ? - Yeah . - Looks like , most recently , MK was tracking you . What ? Phreaking your phone . Texts , calls , locations . What are you doing , MK ? I know you want to protect Sarah 's source , but motivating people to share information quickly is my specialty . We have our own tactics , thank you . If she 'd have brought me with her I 'd be out of your hair by now . Sarah . She wants you to meet her at Beth 's , she 's found something . Kind of annoying , Scottie . Uh , I think you 're gonna want to see this . Dude , are you , like , Hella baked or what ? Just check this out . Oh , shit . Bioluminescence ? Green fluorescent proteins . They must be using them as markers to track gene expression . So the bot 's introducing foreign DNA ? And it seems like , because the host died , it 's all congregating in the tumor . I bet that 's why Leekie had one . It 's some kind of gene therapy delivery system . It could be changing Sarah 's DNA . Sarah ? Sarah ? Over here . Behind you . Well , hello there . - And you are ... - A friend of Sarah 's . How apropos . Sarah 's Deep Throat is a sheep . I have information about Susan Duncan and Rachel . That is excellent news . Now , let 's take off the mask , shall we ? I would not stand up if I were you . Whatever this is , it 's not necessary . Oh , yes , it is . Hello , Ferdinand . What 's your name ? Hmm ? I should know you , but I don 't . I know you . - Is that right ? - Yes . Ferdinand Chevalier . Bastard son of the 10th Earl of Sussex . A stigma you still can 't get over . Well , I wouldn 't go that far , but top marks for presentation . You discovered your bloodlust in the British SAS . Learned to kill quickly and quietly . Perfect recruit for a Topside cleaner . If she found anything on Susan Duncan , she scrubbed it already . We should really get out of here , Sarah . Try , uh , Neolution . Or Rachel Duncan . Yes , Ma ' am . Helsinki . Is that where MK 's from ? Does this ring a bell ? That 's a Scandinavian accent , isn 't it ? Finland , maybe ? I always suspected one clone escaped the purge . Hello , Veera Suominen . Veera Suominen . Let me guess . Her name isn 't MK . And neither one of those girls is you . They must 've found each other , or were put together on purpose . Niki . Niki . She was my only friend . This was a week before she was killed . Just met her boyfriend Alecks . Just began her life . You gassed her family . You burned her alive . Jesus , I know what she 's doing . S , I need to talk to Ferdinand . He 's with you , isn 't he ? At Beth 's . What ? Oh , God . That text wasn 't from you . I need your car . - I 'll come with . - No , no , no . - I need to go alone , please . - You 're serious ? I must be out of my mind . Hey , Sarah ? Not a great time , Cosima . Okay , but I think we figured out what the bots do . Let me guess . It 's bad news . I understand . This is your revenge fantasy . You 've been playing it in your head for years . You killed six of my sisters . Murdered 32 of our friends and loved ones . What 's stopping me from standing up and killing one more ? You tell me . ( Iowa rd ice ? Narcissism ? Rachel ? Rachel ? She was hidden deep . You found her ? I found you first . Sarah handed you to me . I always dreamed of putting a name to your face . Hurting you like you hurt me . What are you doing , Veera ? Veera ! - That 's not my name any more . - Stop it ! Stop ! - Shit . - Sarah ! Talk some sense into her , please . What are you doing , Mika ? I think you know . There 's a bomb under my chair . You can 't do this . I need him . He needs to pay for what he did to Niki . I know , all right ? I know about Helsinki . Did Beth ? Did you tell her what happened to you ? No , she was too fragile . I 'm not all right ? I 'm not gonna back down . I want revenge , too , but we 're not gonna do it like this . For me , it is this . Mika ... Hey , look . Look , Look , Look . The guy is garbage . I know . I know . But he saved my life . Oh , it 's true . That 's a good point . Uh , the bots , Mika ... Mika , the bots , we know what they do . It 's some kind of gene editing . It could be changing my DNA . I need all the help I can get , all right ? And Ferdinand is an asset . - Do you understand that ? - Listen to her . It 's true , it 's true . I can help you . I 've got money . Yes . - 3.7 million . - What ? I sifted through your shell companies . Traced your wire transfers . Password . Corn cob . Two words . Enter it . I will find you . I will finish Helsinki . What , you 're just gonna leave now ? Yes . If you were smart , you would leave , too . You used me . You pulled me out of Iceland , you threw me in the middle of this shit , and now you 're just gonna blow it all up ? Get out of here , Sarah . No . Your friend Niki died . Beth died . What about our sisters that are still alive ? No , I 'm sorry . Two wires , battery , plastic explosives . Taped together pretty well . And you 're absolutely certain there is only one circuit ? Far as I can see . You and me , we 're even now . You understand ? You saved me , and I saved you . I 'm gonna cut this wire and leave the building . Then , and only then , are you gonna stand up . Am I clear ? Just give me a moment . Because if there 's more than one circuit , the whole thing could just ... Damn it , Siobhan , let me prepare myself ! All right , all right . I 'm sure this whole thing is gonna be fine . It 's ... When I get out of here , I 'm going to be a little short of funds . You 're a clever chap . I 'm sure you 'll find some way to make yourself useful . Come in . No one 's ever knocked before . My opinion on Charlotte 's treatment couldn 't wait till morning ? Well ? Immunosuppressive therapy likely won 't save her . Untreated , her data has value . More value than her life . We shouldn 't intervene . That 's what you wanted to hear , isn 't it ? I need to go away again . Why ? Have you found Sarah ? Kendall ? We know you contacted Ferdinand . As you wish , we won 't treat Charlotte . You 're right to think of the future . This stuff from Dr. Bosch better be worth it . Let 's see what creepy Brightborn is all about . Are you having difficulty conceiving ? Are you in a non-traditional relationship , seeking to have a child on your terms ? Perhaps you have genetic risk factors . Totally seen that woman before . Whatever the reason ... I think she was on Oprah . Here at Brightborn Technologies , we can help . I 'm Evie Cho , CEO and founder of the Brightborn Group .

Douglas Andrews , Venture Capitalist , ready for Brightborn Orientation . The plans have changed . Cosima is now carrying your child , Donnie . No . Let me go ! You know who that is ? They sold the drugs through a soap store . This GeneC0nnexion thing . The way you found Adele . It 's connected to Neolution . Oh , my God .

 My , God . What is that ? That killed my entire team . And Dr. Vickers ? Him , too . Did Vickers know what he was looking for ? That the Phase Two animal was a man ? That look like a man to you ? Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey , hey ! Easy , Lara Croft . You need to stand back . This thing killed six rangers . One of them was my best friend . His first daughter just about to be born , so if you think I 'm gonna show this thing any kindness at all ... - He 's dying . - Good . He can 't get dead enough for me . Look , we 're sorry about your team , but this man , we haven 't seen anything like him before . No one has . Lieutenant , we need to take him back with us , alive , so lower your weapon . We have to get him back to the plane . What about my squad ? I 'll put in a request for a recovery team . Request ? I 'll bury them myself . There 's no time for that . I 'm not asking for permission . I 'll stay and help her bury them . If that poor man has the same mutation as the animals , you have to find out why . - You see that ? - Yeah . The scarring looks like ... Yeah . Looks like my arm . Yeah , I know . You two want to share with the class ? Yeah , we were just , um , looking at where you patched him up , unbelievable . He heals quick . Okay , fine , keep your secrets . I 'm more concerned about him . His heart rate is holding steady at 170 . It 's twice what it should be . Respiration is off the charts for a human being . The way he 's changing , the heightened metabolism , accelerated healing ... We saw that in other animals . Yeah , mutation made them better , stronger , right ? Him ... it 's like he 's ... turning into the perfect predator . No , no , no , no , no , no . And do you have any update - on the compound ? - Not yet , but I expect to send a team to look for Jamie soon . We 're just stretched so thin right now . I-I was lucky to be able to task the rangers to accompany Dr. Vickers . Have you located him ? He 's dead . The Phase Two animal he was chasing killed him and the rangers , too . Were you able to secure the animal ? No , there was no sign of it by the time we arrived . It took weeks for Vickers to get this close . I 'd like to keep the team in Patagonia . Continue the search . It 's too dangerous without a military escort . With all due respect , Eleanor , just walking out the front door is a risk these days . I 'll take my chances out here with the rest of my team . Fair enough . Thank you . Why didn 't you tell Eleanor about the ... man we found out there ? He has a Phase Two mutation . So could you . If I tell her the truth , he disappears into a government lab , and we never see him again . Chloe , we have to be honest with ... Studying him might be our only chance to understand this . There 's only one thing that matters now ... finding a cure . I 'm sorry , but I 'm not going to lose you . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , shh . We don 't know what 's going to happen to me . Well , you saw the scar tissue , Jackson . You said it yourself . It 's just like your arm . If we can figure out what happened to him , then we can stop it from happening to you . His arm looks like it was bitten off . More like it was gnawed . Whatever happened , it wasn 't fast . It wasn 't clean . It probably hurt like hell . Son of a bitch . Why is this thing still alive ? Okay , so I got a hit on his fingerprints . He 's a doctor from Hungary working with the Red Cross . Janos Kovacs . Kovacs ? Do you know him ? Yeah . I-I mean , not well , but we worked the same refugee camp in Egypt a few years back . According to his visa , he arrived five weeks ago . Was headed for a village called Ydermo . Well , - then that 's where we start . - Don 't bother . My team was there two days ago . Everyone 's dead . Massacred by this thing Kovacs turned into . Well , it 's our only lead . You all are insane . What if there are more like him out there ? She has a point . We don 't know what we 're walking into . We should wait until Mitch has finished his tests , so we know more about this new mutation . Why am I not surprised you want to stay on the plane ? Excuse me ? You heard me . You know , sometimes what 's out there is worth the risk . But if you want to hang back , take a bubble bath , that 's cool with me . Just stay out of my way , okay ? - Bubble bath ? - Yes . This is how , out of anger , you 'd characterize me ... as a man that has been taking bubble baths since we 've - begun this ? - Metaphorically-speaking , yeah , I 'm comfortable with that characterization . Okay , guys , enough . We need to find the animal responsible for transferring the mutation . Lieutenant Marzan , you 'll take Jackson and Abe to Ydermo . Is that an order ? ' Cause I don 't see stripes on your sleeve . I don 't need stripes . I have a plane . The quicker we get what we need , the quicker you get back to Sao Paolo . We 're in the valley . Shouldn 't the fauna be more lush ? We humped through here on foot . It 's all like this . So what 's up between you and the scientist ? We left a member of our team behind . He blames me . Is he right to ? What the hell kind of rain is this ? That 's not rain . Trail gets hairy from here on . We walk the rest of the way on foot . - I think it 's acidic . - Acid rain ? Probably explains the dying fauna . Sure , but how ? Not a lot of sources of chemical pollution up here . Look at this . Is that ice ? It 's nowhere near freezing . Doesn 't make sense . Nothing has since we 've arrived . Stand back ! I said stand back ! Drop your weapon ! I said drop the weapon ! - Drop the weapon ! - Hey , hey ! No habla Español . No habla Español . Do you speak English ? English ? You . You take the bodies ? Kovacs ... can you hear me ? I don 't think he 's gonna answer you . Pretty sure he can 't . His physiology , biochemistry ... it 's all changing . How ? Well , his brain 's only lighting up around the basal ganglia . It 's the most primitive part of the brain . It 's responsible for our survival , instinct , aggression . Conversation , not so much . But the parts of his brain that make him human ... they 're still there ? Mm-hmm . It 's like they 're switched off , though . And can we switch ' em back on ? Uh , actually , yeah , there might be a way . You should use tranqs . Whatever animal we find we may need alive . Yeah , I 've had this conversation before . Not gonna happen . Is it just me , or are they following us ? When we were here before , there were more bodies . - A lot more . - Tomas , what happened here ? First , rain like blood . Poison the water , food . Then come the Devil . Kill everyone . The Devil ? Is he talking about ... ? Kovacs . Hey , Tomas , there was a man , okay , a doctor . No . No doctor . We wait . He no come . Kovacs never arrived . Rafiki , does this look like an elephant bite ? It does . And those look like the marks on Kovacs ' body . This could lead to the cure . Could he have been bitten by an elephant ? - Elephante . - Elephant ? - In Patagonia ? - Sí . - Elephante . - Where ? Come . I show . This is crazy . What the hell ? ! Unknown caller . Say again . Over . - Unknown caller . I do not copy . - Come on ! Not copy ! Say again . Over . Come on . It could just be interference . Let 's go . This radio operates on my squad 's secure channel . Only another team radio can access it . Okay , so where are the other radios ? We buried them along with the rest of her squad . Who the hell is this ! ? I 'm heading back to the hostel . Look , we have to find the elephant that bit Kovacs . Stop calling him that ! That thing is not Kovacs . I knew Kovacs . He 's long gone . But this ... ? If one of my guys is alive , the last thing I 'm doing is chasing down some elephant . Look , I was there with you . I still have the blood and dirt under my fingernails . Those men we put under the ground are dead . I don 't have time for this . Are you going to give me the keys ? Or am I going to have to take them from you ? If you don 't want to give her the keys , rafiki , you can give them to me . We 'll meet you at the main road . You be careful . You didn 't have to do that for me . Actually , I did it for him . You looked pretty serious about getting the keys . I 'll drive . Hey . Hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Officer ! Officer , help . Officer . Oh , please , please , please , please , please . Oh , come on . Oh , come on . No , no , no , no , no , God . You 're okay . You 're okay . Caraquet . Caraquet . Caraquet . So the plan is to stimulate the neocortex . That 's the most evolved part of the brain . That 's the part of the brain responsible for speech ? More precisely , the part that makes us human . Language , social structure , self-control , empathy . Putting the toilet seat down . All the things we know we should do to be productive members of society . All thanks to the neocortex . Will it hurt him ? No , he 'll be fine . Just a small electronic pulse , kind of like a static shock . What ? Is there something you 're not telling me ? Kovacs proves that the mutation has spread to humans . Finding a new cure is more important than ever . Isabel ... bella . What is that ? I think he 's ... crying . - He 's crashing . - What did you do ? I didn 't even start the test yet . - What 's happening ? - We 've got to cut him loose . - We can 't lose him . - Turn him over on his side . He 's going to choke . Come on , over . If one of my guys is effected , changed like Kovacs , I 'm putting him down . End of discussion . Let 's hope it does not come to that . The body . This is where we buried Ward . He 's gone . There are no tracks around the grave . No signs to say that was dragged out , or walked away . It 's like he just ... Disappeared . Trotter ? Trotter , if you can hear me , stay in the cockpit . Lock the door . Screw this . I think we should go check the bar . Why ? Well , I don 't know , wasn 't alcohol invented for times like this ? I 'm sorry we couldn 't find anything . Ward was going to name his daughter Hermione . She 's due any day now . Hermione . That 's a terrible name . He loved Harry Potter . She 's a character in Harry Potter . Girl wizard or witch ... whatever . Ward said he wanted that for his daughter . That she be a witch ? That she have magic in her . Magic . How come you 've been acting so nice to me , Bubble Bath ? Well , I find , all things considered , it 's easier being nice , than not nice . Did you see ... ? It 's Ward 's body . 150 yards out . 2 : 00 . Faster . Faster , we 're losing him ! I see something . What is that ? Oh , my God . It looks like they 're stockpiling food . But why ? I don 't know . Vultures are not hoarders . They eat their fill and move on . Is that ice ? Dariela , no ! We have to go . We have to go ! Why did you do that ? For this . One more step . Just one more step . Put your foot in front of the other , and then repeat . Like , a million more times . Just a critter . Yeah , just a critter says the woman who saw a raccoon family eat dinner on a police officer 's chest . Help me . Help me . Come , mira . Elefante ? Sí . This way . Damn . Isabella ... Kovacs . , Isabella . A man couldn 't bite off his own arm to get free ... but a man with the Phase Two mutation could . Elefante . We need to get his blood . No , no . No good , no good . No choice . Mitch . He 's alive . Son of a bitch is just toying with us . Go ! Go ! Go ! Run ! Damn it . That was an elephant . I think it 's behind us . Come on , come on . Stop ! We got to run . Come on ! Come on , rafiki ! Go , go , go ! Come on . Tomas . Hey ! Tomas ! Tomas ! Tomas ! No ! Ayúdame ! Oh ! Come on , come on ! Go ! Go , go ! Get in the car ! Get in , get in , get in ! Go , go , go ! Come on , Abe , let 's get out of here ! How did an African elephant find its way to Patagonia ? I don 't know , Abe . You want to jump out and ask him ? Get out ! Watch out ! Quick , out of the way ! Go ! Next time you 're the bait . You 're welcome . These aren 't working ! We need a new plan . I have an idea . You 're lucky to be alive . I 'm fine , Doc . - Abraham . - Chloe . Tell Trotter to get the plane moving now . - What ? - Now ! Please tell me you 're okay to fly . - I 'm always okay to fly . - Good . We 're good to fly . Good . Tell him to start takeoff procedures . But we 're not leaving without you . You better not . Open the cargo ramp and tell Trotter to be ready to floor it . Are you ... Okay , just don 't miss . I 'm out . Come on , he 's gaining on us . Is that an elephant ? Faster , Abe , faster . You got this , come on . Go , go . - Yeah , come on . - Come on , it 's now or never . Okay , hold on ! - Faster , come on . - Abe , faster ! Trotter , go . We did it ! You scared the hell out of me . Sorry . - The name is Logan . - I 'm Jamie . Logan ... use your armpits . For what ? Tuck your fingers under your armpits . When your body 's freezing , it focuses all its energy to keep your vital organs warm , so your torso stays toasty . Thanks . So were you just chilling in the woods , waiting for someone to scare the bejeezus out of ? Yeah . You got me . I was about to give up , too . Lucky for me that you came along . You made it all ... worthwhile . Well , I 'm happy to be of service . Thank you for the coat . Sure . Some kind of gentleman I 'm turning out to be , right ? It 's the man who 's supposed to give up his coat for the lady . Not vice versa . We 're gonna die out here , aren 't we ? Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no . No one 's dying out here . We made it this far , we 're gonna make it the rest of the way . Rest of the way to what ? Look around , there 's nothing out here . Hey . See this ? This is where we 're going . There 's shelter . There 's hope . And if we 're lucky , there 's a hell of a lot of vodka ... in Caraquet . There were bodies everywhere . Stacked like firewood . Never before have I seen a wake this large descend from above the clouds . What were they doing up there ? I think they were responsible for the blood rain that drove the villagers away . How is that possible ? As much as I hate to admit it ... he 's right . Ran some tests on the rain while I was waiting for the results on that , uh , elephant blood you brought back . So the vultures are responsible for the rain ? This blood rain is highly acidic , and the protein structure matches the corrosive bile that vultures have in their digestive tract . How did the bile get into the rain ? The frozen feather . It 's cold at 40,000 feet . The vultures feed , they fly above the cloud cover . And that high up , they can seed the clouds with acidic bile . But they were stockpiling human bodies . So you 're saying that ... The red color ? It 's blood . Human blood . So not only did they feed on the villagers , but they poisoned their water supply , destroyed their crops . This is a whole new level aberrant aggressive behavior . " My dear , sweet Hermione . I can only pray that you never have to read this . That your young life will , of course , include me . But if you are reading this , it is because ... " Well , how about the elephant blood that I brought back in ? Unremarkable . We 've seen plenty of animals with the same mutation , right ? If there was something special about the elephant , I could attribute that mutation transfer to that , but it 's ... But it isn 't about the elephant . It 's about the man . So you 're saying that there 's something specific about Kovacs ' genetic makeup that made it possible for the mutation to occur in him . Yeah , that 's what it looks like . Now , I think it 's gonna take a little time to figure out what that is exactly . Fine . Then you run more tests . We have him , we have a chance . We can study him and maybe learn how to reverse it . You let that thing loose again ? Dariela , now is not the time . Instead of putting it down , you let it loose again ... I 'm sorry about your friends , but they died in the line of duty . And right now , there 's only one person that matters . Janos Kovacs . Stop saying that . That 's not him . Yes , it is . He 's still in there ! No , he 's not .

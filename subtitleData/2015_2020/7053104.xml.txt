 [ panting ] [ sighs ] Ferdinand . You came back . How did you know ? Shit , I passed out , sorry . Is there any movement out there ? Not a thing . It 's too quiet . No , no , I don 't like it . What 's not to like ? Our friends are coming . - Get Kira up before you come up . - Thank you . [ theme music playing ] Kira ? - [ Kira ] Coming ! - Come on , babe . - I 'm right here . - There 's someone who wants to meet you . Okay . - That is Charlotte . - Whoa . - Hi . - She 's gonna go with you to Art 's till we see how things fall , yeah ? So , you 're what my mum looked like . Yeah . I never really think about that any more . [ Art ] Yeah , they 'll be safer with my ex . Plus my daughter 'll get a kick out of it . I don 't get it . Why aren 't the Neos after us ? Yeah , Anger 's AWOL , too . There 's no one on me . Rachel must 've shown the cabal our proof of P.T. ' s real identity . Those men on the board , they 're realising they 've been had . - They 're scrambling to protect themselves . - So finally Rachel 's their target ? Well , she 's certainly a liability . - [ Sarah ] Yeah , come on . Let 's go , guys . - [ door opens ] - [ music playing in background ] - [ keys tapping ] Hey , here 's one . There is nothing I wouldn 't do for my friend . I have no notion of doing things by halves . It 's not my nature . Can you guess who that is ? It is Jane Austen . [ scoffs ] I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It 's just all this info from Europe shows a dozen countries have pending legislation like Kuwait 's . Hundreds of millions of people are about to be required to submit their DNA , and Neolution is behind it . They need that data . Okay , so you wanna spend the morning safeguarding the genetic future of humankind , or do you wanna have brunch ? We have a Skype date . Siobhan wants a summit . - You calling them or what ? - They 're calling us . " Us " ? Why 're you so bloody calm ? Oh , wait for it , chicken . Hello , North American scum ! - [ laughs ] - We bought a shit mountain of cheese . Welcome back . - Hey , you 're home ! - Yeah , did you forget ? Tonight 's my big " coming out " party . - Your art opening ? - An art opening ? Do you think that 's a good idea right now ? - No , yes . - It 's an exceptional idea . And I 'm really sorry that you can 't come , Cos . What ? Why can 't I come ? How 're you gonna come ? You gonna dress up as Sarah ? This is my first show in two years . I 'm not gonna have any sestra shenanigans . - I can 't do it . - He 's got some big wheels coming in , Ezra Lue , this gallerist that we met in Geneva . Adele 's making appetizers , the Hendrixes are helping set up , and you can totally come later if you want to , I promise . I do . I do wanna come . But , Mum , if P.T. ' s lost the board , that means Neolution 's on the ropes . Yeah , so well done , everyone . Felix and Adele , dirt well dug . Delphine , you showed us what to do with it , and we deserve a breather tonight to stand down and support Felix . I think you 're right , Siobhan . - I think we 've earned a break . - Have we ? Well , it 's settled . We 're gonna take the day off from crazy . [ Chrissy ] Thank you for letting me stay . I don 't have a family any more . I didn 't know where else to go . What ? When did Mark die ? Two weeks ago . How did you find me again ? Well , you told me about Sister Irina , how she ... That you and the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the new world after they cut out her tongue . You don 't trust me ? I don 't blame you after what my father did to you . He is dead . These are miracle babies . I 'm sorry I came . I 'll go . You still have family . You see ? They remember you . [ chuckles ] - They 're saying hello . - [ chuckles ] All right . Uh , how 's Helena over here , Ali ? It 's fine with me ! Yeah , but left , right ? Like , where should she be in relation to her sisters ? Whatever you think . - Okay , this is a test right ? - [ scoffs ] I 'm gonna do something , and then you 're gonna lambaste me for doing it wrong ? No , I 'm not gonna micro-manage you , Donnie . - Is that what you 're wearing ? - What 's wrong with this ? - [ Inhales sharply ] - Should I untuck ? Would that be cooler ? Donnie , it 's perfect . I need a straight man behind the bar . Oh ! Thank God you 're here , Felix . Thank you ! But you can 't be . - What ? - Yeah . You 'll need your sisters , and I have a performance idea . Yeah , she brought the Korg . Oh , God , no . - You ready for that whisky , Adele ? - Oh , hell , yes . Just three fingers , please . Okay , we 're not done yet . We need to still go after this Al-Khatib guy . The Neo bag man ? He controls their slush fund . I mean , he 's so protective it 's not even funny . If he is bribing governments for citizens ' genetics , - then we 've gotta ... - Leave it , love , will you ? Why don 't you help Adele with the snacks ? Oh , that would be great . I 'm going Southern Regional . We can catch up . Great . See you both at the opening . Where are you off to ? I 'm just , uh , going to get some flowers . - Mum ! - Chicken ... You 're a worrier , and I 've told you everything I know . And you 're right . We can 't stand down yet , but that 's exactly why I need you at the opening . Look out for your brother , make sure there 's no trouble . SCOTT : Okay , so that 's 144 prepared doses of the inoculate . Yeah . Depending how much of the cellular culture survived , - we can manufacture twice that again . - Then what ? You go around inoculating LEDAs with it ? Yeah , that 's the plan . But we still don 't know how many there are . Well , that 's what we 're gonna find out . Right , Scottie ? - Where you going ? - Um , out . I thought we were all heading over to Felix 's together . I 'll catch you guys later , okay ? Sure . We have this whole " don 't ask , don 't tell " thing going on . Ta . Hey . - You ready ? - Are you sure about this ? Wouldn 't it be safer if the others knew ? We have one shot at this , and if it 's gonna work , Sarah can 't know who we dealt with to get here . What about after ? After you go to the opening like nothing happened , then I will send you instructions there . Are we good ? - Yeah . - Okay . I so love being in the middle of all of this . [ sighs ] Um ... Rachel . Rachel was rather impressed with our transgressive little alliance , weren 't you ? It made me sick to work with the man who killed MK . Sarah doesn 't know you two are here , does she ? No , it 's just the four of us . Our interests are very firmly aligned as you now have a nice , big , fat target on your back , too . So ... Neolution goes down for good , or we all do . This is a summary of the evidence we 've amassed so far , but we need you to help us prove it . I 'd like to talk to you . Alone . You 'd be dead if I hadn 't called him in to save you . After you . So we spiked our Gluvine with vodka ... Gluvine and intrigue . Nice . And , um , Felix and I , actually , got some serious apr√®s-ski cred by the end of it , but Delphine was , like , all business . What was S even doing with her out there ? I don 't know , I mean I only met her the once . - Who else was she meeting ? - I have no idea . And we don 't have time for this . We gotta get ready . Westmorland wants unprecedented access to human genetics , and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing governments worldwide to get it . But you don 't have record of any of that , do you ? No , but Neolution want to sell curated commercialized evolution to the one percent who can afford it , so they can live forever , grow a bloody tail if they want to . The rest of us , Coady 's department , targeted for sterilization . How 's that sitting with you these days ? You saved my granddaughter . I 'm willing to take a gamble on nature over nurture . This is all the supporting evidence to our claims . Without proof of bribes , it will barely carry a news cycle . You 're a smart woman , Rachel . Like any good CEO , you kept a shadow file . A record of where the bodies are buried . Give me the proof I need to back this up . Give yourself a chance to be truly free . [ Ali ] Let Cosima make an appearance ! [ Felix ] No . - Yes ! - I 'm not gonna do that . What I need is for you to leave right now before people start arriving , and something clone-y happens . - Alison ... - Look all around you . It 's already happening . - Right ? - [ chuckles ] Oh ... - Shit . Collin . - Hello , Felix . Hello . - Oof , I 've come early . - And often , I remember . Hmm . Oh , this is my , um , - foster sister , Sarah . - [ chuckles nervously ] You , uh , you Colin , then ? Cool . Very cool . - You all right ? - Yes , I remember the time I ID 'd your dead body . Yes , but we got over that , didn 't we , Colin ? - Did we ? - Yes . - I think we did . - Yeah . - Hey ! - Oh , my God , it 's so light in here . Hello ! Bar 's to the left , enjoy yourselves . Have a look around , yeah ? Congratulations . Both of you . That book is about your life ? Yes . It 's for my babies . It 's my joys , and my pain and sorrows , so they walk a brighter path . - [ footsteps approaching ] - [ knock on door ] Sister Irina is going to town , - so we have to take care of toilet . - Toilet ? Cleaning . - Come , when you are done . - Huh . - [ keypad beeps ] - [ cell phone ringing ] [ Mark on phone ] Chrissy . - Hello , Mark . - So good to hear your voice . Have you found her ? No . I couldn 't find her . Chrissy , I 'm depending on you , I don 't get the cure otherwise . I 'm checking another convent tomorrow . I 'll call you then . I miss you , Mark . Yeah , I miss you too . I love you . [ keypad beeps ] Is she lying ? [ Hip-hop music playing in background ] [ Felix ] Oh , good lord , don 't look now . - Ezra Lue is here . - Who 's he ? Ezra Lue , he 's the gallerist from Geneva . He 's got spaces in London , Paris and L.A. , and I 'm quite sure I oversold myself . Well , then do something ! Come on , do something unique ! Cosima is dropping off Scott . Maybe you could use us . Make it part of the show . All right . - Clone swap . - Ooh ! Donnie , get the champagne , and put Cosima on standby . - [ whispering ] The music ! - [ music stops ] - [ mystical music playing ] - Now drop the accent , and be yourself . Ezra . Wie geht 's ? Felix . Gentlemen , I would like you to meet my sister , Hestia , goddess of hearth and home . Ah ! We 're intrigued , sister . We know so much , yet so little . - Where do you live in the real world ? - I live deep in Bailey Downs , which is a suburb just north of here . Oh , and this is my husband , Donnie . Champagne ? Napkin ? No alcohol for me , I need to drive the soccer bus . You look different . Yes , well , I 'm always different . Identity is a social construct , boys . Danke . My God , that was completely perfect . - They must be confused . That was so great . - Yeah ? Oh , good . Okay . All right , out the back you go . - Go , go ! I love you . - I love you . - [ Scottie ] Felix , are we clear ? - Yeah , yeah , come on . [ Cosima ] Felix ! Felix ! - Oh ! - My God , hello ! - Congratulations ! - Oh , thank you . Look at you ! God , you look so rosy-cheeked ! You 're bounding up stairs ! Yeah , I 'm back , and I 'm back to bounding . Yeah , you are . It 's fabulous . Now tell me . How do you feel about long stares and large groups of people ? Ooh , no . If you 're gonna show up , you 're gonna show off , darling . Scottie , curtain . [ loudly ] My dear friends ... May I present to you Metis , goddess of wisdom and of deep thought . - [ applause ] - Brilliant . Just do whatever comes naturally . - [ dance music playing ] - [ people cheering ] Okay , well what are you saying , Sarah ? We 're late . Are you gonna get dressed ? I am dressed . I 'm just thinking that S and Delphine are up to something , right ? Your mom is at the florist , hon . She 's thinking about your brother . Are you ? S said last week that she 's got some other source , so I 'm trying to figure out ... Do you have any idea how hard your brother 's been working for tonight ? Yeah , my brother 's got a problem with me , he 'll tell me . Well , why don 't I tell you my problem ? The entire time that we were gone , he was painting you , different versions of you . But you don 't seem to care . And Delphine , I don 't know if it helps chill you out , all she did was whatever Siobhan told her to , all right ? The only thing I know is a phone call about a meeting with some French guy . Francis , or Fernando , or ... - Ferdinand ? - Maybe . Who 's Ferdinand ? He killed my sister . Oh . This is a bloody goldmine . Do you realise what we could do with this information ? - Yes . - And she just gave it to you ? She needs me . I 'm the one with a smoking gun . Names , dates , and amounts . A full record of worldwide influence payments . [ gasps ] Oh ... [ laughs ] I bloody love you . This ... We could squeeze anything we want out of these Neo-pricks . It 's just ... It 's the fortune we dreamed of . Freedom from all of them . I gave Sarah her daughter back . I don 't owe them anything . Why am I getting texts from my sister saying that you and S are up to something ? I don 't know , Felix . Maybe it 's because we are up to something . Great ! That 's good enough for me . - Tequila ? - Yes . - Claro . - Great . - Si . - Sant√© . Chin chin . Oh , my God . - Art . - Hey , you see Sarah yet ? Um , she 's on her way . Is everything all right ? Just let me know if she gets here , okay ? Oh , you 'll know . Van Leer confirmed the meet . They 're assembling in an hour . The board is in disarray . They 'll be amenable . They won 't be when they hear we 're taking a cut of all their future business . - [ groans ] - Breathe . [ groans ] Just let it pass . [ exhales sharply ] There 's another way . We can choose to make my information public . I have a sizable nest egg . It wouldn 't last forever but if we wanted we could destroy Westmorland and Neolution . Go somewhere warm . Off the grid . I can see it now . Lounging around at low tide in our flip flops , browsing Reader 's Digest , dipping toast points into egg yolks . Glorious . With this ... We can build a dynasty . Obscene wealth . Anything we want . Who 's your Daddy ? You are . [ Cosima ] You like it that much ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , it 's just ... We 're on the precipice of being able to do anything that we want . What do you wanna do with our freedom ? - I want ... - Clone swap . - Sarah 's here . - Oh , Felix . - No . - She needs to talk to you . - You ... You 've done something wonderful . - Yeah . You are one of our best guys . - Best ? - Along with Donnie and Scott and Art . - Well , that 's exquisite company , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I think so . - Sold . - It 's lovely . Thank you . - Thank you . - Look , we have to go . - You own me . - [ chuckling ] - Hey . - Yeah . You 're mine . Arms up . [ applause ] - Incredible . - Oh , my God . All right . Lovely . I don 't know what S did , but tell Sarah that she ... - Tell her yourself . - All right . - I love you . - Love you , more . Oh , my God . All right . Ready and waiting . - Is S here ? - Where 's Adele ? - [ Adele ] Crap , I dropped my hushpuppies . - Did you get her drunk ? Do you know who 's S 's real source was , the one who got us to Coady ? I 'm not doing this right now with you . It was Ferdinand . - What ? - I spilt some beans . She 's in league with him . I think her and Delphine are cutting a deal with Rachel . Shit . That 's terrible . That 's brutal . Then you 're not gonna like this either . But Donnie , curtain ! Athena . - Goddess of war . - [ applause ] Don 't . Come on . Just ... Turn around or I 'll kill you . Just take the stage . You think this will work in the new space ? Big time . [ applause continues ] [ mobile chimes ] Where 's Delphine ? She left . And in a hurry . [ Sarah ] Some shit 's going down . Yeah , Anger , she 's gone AWOL . So , I think I better stick around for a bit - just to be safe . - Okay . Keep an eye out for S , yeah ? Yeah . Hey . Clean floor , dirty heart . [ beeps ] [ Mark ] Chris , it 's me ... We need to know if you found her yet . Call me back . Please . Mark is sick . Coady said she could help ... - Coady ? We are family . - I know . I knew it when I saw you . Which is why I told them I couldn 't find you . I didn 't tell them where you are . - You didn 't ? - No . - But you use this phone . - Yes . They will trace it . We have to leave . Go . Gentlemen , ladies of the board . Well , Rachel has a bit of a headache I 'm afraid . She plucked out her own eye . Well , you seem to be missing some teeth . Empty seats ? - Suicides . - Oh , God . Yes . That must be like Neolution Black Friday . The shame . Titans of industry . Sucked in by a lie not even a child would swallow . Not all of us were deceived . Oh , Mr Al-Khatib with your dirty hands , so glad to hear you say that . We no longer take our direction from Mr Westmorland . Show us the evidence and tell us how much you want . Enclosed are a list of key PaySends in six areas . Food , pharmaceuticals , cloning , gene editing , sequencing . Bio-surveillance . So , yes , every time a technician blinks we will get paid . But judging by the size of these bribes , you 'll all be making billions anyway . May I ? [ Rachel ] He won 't be coming back . You 're doing the right thing , Rachel . To the wrong man . The only one who ever really loved me . [ beeps ] We do what we can . Each of us in our own way . And , we do it for each other . Chipping at the devil till he 's done . There , uh ... Seems to be some , uh , technical difficulties . He has nothing . [ grunts ] Hands on the table where I can see them . [ man screams ] Sorry about that , old chap . Rest assured this is not over . We are not finished with any of you . [ Helena ] I have food for us . Come , Chrissy , we have to go . [ grunts ] [ screaming ] This Neo is shit ! Easy there , pumpkin . We don 't wanna harm your cargo . I 'm sorry . I know . It won 't hurt . It 's okay . You 're forgiven . [ gunshot ] Hey . You all right ? Why wouldn 't I be ? - Incoming . - What the hell , S ? I 'm sorry , love . I saw a window . You 've worked with MK 's murderer . I knew you couldn 't stomach it . He was the key to Rachel . - Hey . Hey , hey . - Hey , Felix . Hey , what the hell 's going on ? These are for you . - Flowers ! Well , I 'm over it . - I 'm not . What did you pull with Rachel ? She gave us the missing piece of the puzzle . Full financial records of Neolution 's dark money bribes . - What ? - We 've got everything we need . Proof of decades of illegal human experiments and of Coady 's sterilization plan . We 're ready to expose them . You 're serious ? Yeah . It 's done . [ exhales sharply ] [ Cosima ] This is it ? This is everything ? Yeah . Loaded . And ready to send all the regulatory and oversight committees in the affected countries . As well as to all journalist friends of Siobhan at The Guardian . You guys did all this for us . You ready ? Just a sec . [ laughs ] [ sobbing ] Hello . I would like to start by thanking you all for coming . Um , and I 'd also like to thank you all - for buying . - [ all laugh ] - Whoo-hoo . - And now is the part of the night where I 'd like to introduce my muse in her true form . - Oh , Christ . - I know . My sister Sarah ! [ applause and cheering ] Bow . [ laughs ] My sister and I ... My sister and I are orphans , you see . And , um , we ... could have ended up anywhere . We could have ended up in any family . And if we had , we would have been entirely different people . But my mum , - Siobhan . This woman . - Oh , no . - Come on . This woman ... - Felix . She chose us as her own . We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada . Watching her raise my sister , watching my sister raise her own daughter , finding my biological sister , it 's quite mad . It 's taught me that we are all mysterious works of chance , of choice , of nature versus nurture . - Hi . - Hi . So to my galaxy of women . Thank you for the nurture . [ applause ] - I 'm proud of you . - I love you . Thank you . [ crowd cheering ] All right , now . Let 's party ! Music ! [ door rattles ] [ door closes ] That was a death trap . That meeting . You expected them to kill me . I told you what I wanted . You chose not to listen . What , we just ride off into the sunset when everything we have ever wanted was at our fingertips ? You expected me to take a payoff . That is how we win ! No , we win if Neolution is exposed and Westmorland is stripped of his myth ! Where 's your smoking gun , Rachel ? There 's nothing for you here . Oh , you gave it to her ! You can 't hurt me . No ? " Oh , please don 't hit me , Daddy . Let me hit you , Daddy . " I pay for everything - to be under your heel . - Ferdinand . I would have squirmed there forever , you heartless bitch ! [ grunts ] [ grunts ] Ferdinand . Daddy . [ screaming ] [ coughing ] [ door closes ] [ panting ] Ezra over there wants to exhibit them in New York . Oh , that 's fantastic . And he 's also interested in my back catalogue . - Oh . - It 's mad . It 's so mad . - I can 't believe it . - You were always so creative , you know . A little fighting creative spirit , even when you were tiny . This is Colin , Mum . Someday soon he 'd like to come around for tea - and asking for my hand , isn 't that right ? - Oh . - Colin , hello . - Hello . He does though have some rather piercing questions about some of my muses . Oh , well ... You better settle accounts there before you come around to me then . Well , I think we can work something out . Yes , I 'm sure . Ladies and gentlemen , are you ready to raise some hell will the Wizard ? Let me hear you say " Yeah ! " [ crowd ] Yeah ! ‚ô™ My love isn 't tainted It 's just complicated ‚ô™ ‚ô™ We 're saving the world from down in the basement ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I saw the truth I just couldn 't face it ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All of these people , They 've been duplicated ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But they can 't contain us We 're breaking the cages ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Lab rats got out of the mazes ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Civilisation , alternative patience ‚ô™ ‚ô™ We won 't be complacent We 're changing the station ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Right now Gotta run away , gotta get away ‚ô™ [ mobile rings ] ‚ô™ Gotta keep up They don 't hesitate ‚ô™ [ Rachel ] Siobhan . Ferdinand made it out . - I thought he might . - He knows you have the files . Be careful . Thank you , Rachel . Good bye , Siobhan . ‚ô™ This tainted love you 've given ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Take my tears and that 's not nearly all ‚ô™ [ all shout ] [ applause and cheering ] Well , that 's a bloody mess . Do you wanna shoot first or ask questions ? [ creaking ] [ Ferdinand ] Hello , Siobhan . Welcome home . Were you really gonna shoot me coming in my own door ? - In the leg . - So you do wanna talk . No . I just wanna put holes in you with this .45 . Bigger than holes you can put in me with that 9mm . Won 't make much of a difference in the throat , love . Or we put them down ? What have you done with my future ? She just wasn 't that into you . I 'm not talking about Rachel . Oh , shadow file . Oh , is it on the shelf over there ? Where you stashed the gun I took this clip out of ? No . [ scoffs ] The thing is ... It 's all going public right now as we speak . [ exhales sharply ] Well , the thing is if you are gonna stash a weapon you should keep it close to you . And that 's just a little twisted ... - [ gunshot ] - [ gasps ] [ grunts ] Shite ... Where 's S ? Left ventricle . Won 't take long . - Right . - Well done , Siobhan . Such grit . I 'll take a mercy tab . Thanks . Really ? I have to admit I 'm a little disappointed in you . Would you pass me that photograph at least ? Aw . Not on your life . [ grunts ] Quite enough lip out of you . [ gagging ] [ groans ] You know , as a woman , I 'm 14 % more likely to survive a gunshot wound than you . Maybe not this one but ... Okay , it 's been a good one . Chickens .

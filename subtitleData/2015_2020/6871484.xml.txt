 [ narrator ] It is the year 4032 . Man 's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies , that rule the Earth . One man saw the catastrophe coming . He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years , and defy mankind 's extinction . Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence , the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines . [ narrator ] Previously an Wayward Pines ... [ gunfire ] [ screaming ] We 're collecting the weapons that were commandeered from the armory last night . I won 't discover that you kept some for yourself ? We should have a baby . A son to lead . Or a daughter . I know we had our problems , but there were good times too . Maybe you can tell me when I 'm coming back home . In the last two hours , the Abbies have reentered the valley outside the fence . They vastly underestimated these creatures . The temporal gyrus of a chimp is about a third of the size of the humans ' . And hers appears to be double the size of ours . We 've done some preliminary tests with the female , - and it seems to me- - - Did you say , female ? There 's a female Abby in this town ? Her palm , does it have a mark ? This experiment ends now . [ screaming ] Stop , if you kill her , we all die ! It 's not just their minds , it 's math , and they have the numbers . There 's over a thousand now . They are gathering for her , they are coming for her . That is what the brand is for . She is their leader . [ man on PA ] Good citizens of Wayward Pines , this is the dawn of a new day . We must unite as one and stand together against our enemy . We will not let this threat outside our walls drive us into hiding . We will find peace in our normal way of life . This time will pass . Go to school , work hard , be happy . Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines . [ buzzing ] Dr. Yedlin , good to see you today . - Kerry . - Dr. Yedlin , how 's your arm ? - Fine , thank you . - What are your next steps , since you have now established the basics of communication ? She 's not gonna speak to us again unless she 's forced . But everything you indicated- - Yeah , I was building a trust . That was destroyed with three gunshots . I have the results of your examination . Just say it . We found trauma . Some residual scarring , possibly from the creature attack , possibly from something else . Could be endometriosis , but we don 't have the equipment for that , so ... You wouldn 't be able to carry a child to term . I 'm sorry . We 're supposed to have children . We need to have children . I wanted to do my part , I wanted to contribute . Or what ? He 'll make you disappear like the others ? Thank you , Dr. Yedlin . After I meet with Jason , I 'll stop by the lab so you can walk me through the next steps of your research . And if Megan gives you any trouble , please let me know . [ elevator dings ] [ alarm blaring ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] [ alarm blaring ] [ man over PA ] This is a Code Red . There has been a security breach in the lab . All personnel , get to your posts . [ indistinct radio chatter ] This is a Code Red . There has been a security breach in the lab . All personnel , get to your posts . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ indistinct radio chatter ] Oh , my God . [ alarm blaring ] How did it happen ? Code 's on the cage . She saw us input them and memorized them . She wants to get back to them . And do what ? This . Revenge for what we did to them . Start searching . Every air duct , every hallway , every stairwell . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ soldier ] Hallway Three is clear . [ soldier ] Hallway Four , clear . [ soldier ] Hallway Seven , clear . [ soldier ] All floors clear . Check the tunnels . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ distant screaming ] Let 's go . Where is she ? [ screaming ] [ theme music playing ] She could 've escaped two minutes ago or two hours ago , we have to warn the town . The soldiers will handle it . What do you think the rest of them are out there for ? They 're there for her , they 're waiting . They wouldn 't attack while we had her captive . We are telling the town now ! He 's right . We 'll tell them the truth . I can set up two teams , one to move around the perimeter to the south side of town , in case she heads back to the woods- - She saw a way in , she 's gonna find her way out . Then we 'll move through the neighborhood systematically . You have enough men for that ? We 'll get people from town to help in the search . Unarmed . If they see something , they 'll report it immediately . We just collected the rebels guns , we can 't risk handing them right back . - Dr. Yedlin ! - I 'm going to find Hassler . You okay ? I 'm fine . - Jason- - - Kerry ... No matter how smart she is , we 're going to find her . [ indistinct chatter ] Hey . Did you talk to him ? He didn 't come home . Last night , at all ? Last two nights , I don 't know where he is . The hospital , maybe . Well , is he trying to avoid you , or the other way around ? What do you want me to say , Xander ? I 'm barely coming to terms with this myself . Hey , he ? - Why is this so hard for you to talk about ? Because we 're all stuck here together , and I still care about him . He 'll know it 's not his . I know . I 'll tell him . Look , it happened , and now here we are . With a baby coming . That 's what I want ... and I think it 's what you want , too . We can 't control what happens out there , but in here , we can . [ snoring ] [ phone ringing ] [ phone ringing ] [ woman ] Arlene . [ school bell ringing ] [ indistinct chatter ] There 's been an emergency . Your parents have been notified . Everyone head inside . - [ boy ] What 's happening ? - [ man ] I don 't know , head on inside . Come on . [ indistinct chatter ] Head on in . Don 't push . [ Man over PM Attention , citizens of Wayward Pines , please move inside , lock the doors . An Abby has escaped from the super structure . If you see something , report it immediately . Let 's go . Hurry up . Attention citizens of Wayward Pines , please move inside . Lock the doors . An Abby has- - Come on , we 'll go to the dorms . Is this it ? Are we dead ? Hey , you can do whatever you want , and you 're going back to the dorms ? That 's what they said to do . They say a lot of things . We got a big , electric fence . Abbies aren 't getting in . Except when they build one of those ladder things . Hey ... if it is the end of the world , I 'm not spending it hiding it in a basement . I wanna see Rebecca . - Luce . - I 'm scared . Look , we have to go back inside , okay ? She makes me feel better about these things , please . Okay , okay , I 'll walk you . Get inside . Get inside ! Hey , everybody , off the street , now ! Come on ! Come on ! Hurry up . Hurry UP - Let 's go . Let 's go . [ man over PA ] If you see something ... Attention citizens of Wayward Pines , please move inside , lock the doors . An Abby has escaped from the super structure . If you see something , report it immediately . Attention citizens of Wayward Pines , please move inside , lock the ... So , the Spelling Bee 's coming up . Have you been practicing ? Remember , it 's A-B-B-Y , not A-B-B-I-E . And it 's Pilcher , not Pilchner . There 's no N in it . I know . [ growling ] [ growling ] [ woman ] Oh , be careful . [ growl ] [ tires screeching ] [ screaming ] [ soldier screaming ] [ soldier screaming ] [ distant screams ] She escaped , didn 't she ? Can you help me find her ? Frank . Lucy , get in here . Are you okay ? [ soldier ] Stop . We 'll do a sweep of Main Street . [ Mario ] Fan out . Front Jeep with me . Check the roofs . Check the alleyways too . [ soldier ] Alley is clear . [ Xander ] Everybody back . Back to the back . Come on ! [ hissing ] [ everybody gasps ] [ soldiers shouting ] UP there ! [ gunfire ] [ gunfire ] What you got ? She 's got to be going to the fence , but these tracks are going the other direction . No , she knows this place better than we do . She used to live here . I remember the first week . The first day . I didn 't know where anything was . I didn 't even know how to turn on this computer . You were always there for me . Your counsel , caution , your enthusiasm . You taught me to stand on my own two feet . And then I wasn 't there for you . I 've tried to do the right things . - Sir . - I 'll be there in a minute . She won 't get away with this . Where is she headed ? There 's all sorts of reports coming in , sir . Someone said they spotted her on Cherry Blossom , another on 7th on the other side of town . She 's is the sewer , she 's hiding in a trash can . Did you set up a perimeter on the south side of town ? I 'm running out of men , sir . How do we know that 's where she 's going ? We 'll use civilians . Put the word out . Anyone who wants to help in the search , let them . Otherwise everyone stays indoors . Copy - - Let 's go . - Sir . Where did you get those ? I kept them hidden in the storm drain in the back alley after the crops burned . They need our help finding her . Mountains , Main Street , here . Hospital , school , less than 10 kilometers to the fence at the narrowest point . You 're a very well-informed hair stylist . She designed the town . You built Wayward Pines ? So you knew ? Hey , hey , hey . She was abducted , just like most of us , all right ? We can stand here and we can talk about her past , or we can deal with the problem at hand , and she is best person to help us out . The best vantage points are the rooftops of the hotel , the hospital and this part of the elevated ground of the western section of the nature preserve . We need binoculars ... and more weapons . I can do things . I can help . I watch birds . Binoculars . I have a pair at home . I use them to watch birds . I mean , there aren 't a lot of birds , but I do like to watch them . I mean , it 's not like I use them to watch my neighbors . I 'll go get the binoculars . They 're in my bedroom . Okay . We want to help search . Here . Don 't point these at anything you don 't want to kill . Be careful . It 's hard to get in here . So if there 's only one soft spot to sneak in , wouldn 't she just try to sneak back out the same way ? If she 's trying to sneak out . Maybe that 's the way they 'll all be coming back in to destroy the town for good . We built Wayward Pines on the ruins of the old town . If only I had the original surveys from the town here before . There is hard copy , back in the mountain . I 'll get them . Meet me back in my house in an hour , okay ? Rebecca , be careful . So , you know how to fire that thing ? My dad taught me . And then we swore off it , after I saw the damage I had to repair , and what it did to people . We 've all gone back on promises we 've made . That 's what happens here . Unless someone steps up , starts making promises that they keep . So , what do you say , Doc ? You bag this trophy , you have a little victory dance on Main Street ? She 's not a trophy . You better hope she is . I need something from his office . You work at Wayward Beauty . No one from the hair salon has clearance . Jason asked me to get it . Go ahead , radio him . He 's only trying to stop an escaped Abby . I 'm sure he can take your call . [ doorknob clicks ] It wasn 't her blood . She used him to send us the wrong way . She 's not injured at all . Come on . [ Kerry ] Find what you 're looking for ? [ Rebecca ] I did . The original geological surveys , they 'll help in the search . They must be planning to get in through an old abandoned tunnel . Jason won 't approve of you stealing his things . I 'm not sure I do either . They aren 't his to begin with . Why are you with him ? Is that any business of yours ? You know , you can do more here than you realize ? - And standing behind Jason- - - I don 't stand behind him . Oh , yeah , you do . With everything that 's happened , it doesn 't help anyone . Especially you . Why are you with him ? He 's strong , he 's interesting , he challenges me . I meant Xander . So did I . There 's the man you marry in Boston , then there 's the man you marry in Wayward Pines . I see . Different worlds . I 'm not defined by either of them . I am my own person , Kerry . You should be , too . She 's headed east . Based on what ? She 's been heading south . From the mountain across Main Street , through town , that 's south . The fence is south , we go south . [ soldier ] Look up ! On this house . What 's on that roof ? [ soldier 1 ] Can you check the alley ? [ soldier 2 ] You hear that ? There ! Movement ! [ indistinct shouting ] [ panting ] - You good ? Okay . - Yeah , yeah . [ baby crying ] [ growling ] [ dog barking ] Let 's go . [ dog barking ] [ dog barking ] Clear ! - Backyard is clear ! - Check ! Watch under porches . - Let 's go . - What 's on that roof ? [ clanging ] [ dog barking ] [ growling ] [ growling ] - Tom . - Are you okay ? What are you guys doing out here ? Get inside ! What are you doing out here ? Go back to your home ! - We 're here to help , okay ? - We don 't need your help ! - Hey , behind that house . - Where ? [ growling ] Sir , behind that house ! Over here , over here , over here ! Behind you ! Over here , over here , over here ! [ groans ] Mario ! [ gunshot ] [ groaning ] [ gasping ] Drop your weapon ! That was an accident ! We didn 't know it was you ! We thought- - I don 't care ! Drop your weapon ! [ Mario ] Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Stand down ! Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Maybe they got her . Maybe they didn 't . I 'm heading east . Whoa . Whoa . [ Theo ] Hey . - Put that weapon down . - They shot at us ! Yeah , well , you shot back . Let 's not make this any worse than it is . We got to get to the hospital . What about him ? He 's not breathing . Is he okay ? Is he gonna be okay ? - I 'm sorry . He 's gone . - No ! No . Hey , hey , he ? ! What have you done ? Get out of the way . I 'm not moving . Put the gun down . All of you . They shouldn 't even have weapons . This town isn 't working . This system isn 't working . We need to change this , we need to do it ourselves together . We 're running out of time . Put them down . Down ! Let 's get to the hospital . What do we do now , sir ? One , two , three . - Anything ? - No , sir . There was one incident but unrelated to Margaret . The number of Abbies outside the fence has tripled . I know . They must be here for her . Should we get back to the mountain ? Come with me . What is this place ? This is for us . These are for the pods . You said this is for us . Is this the only one ? Does anyone else know ? Just us . This is it . I told Rebecca that we needed a nursery . And we will sometime soon , right ? - Jason . - Kerry , there are thousands of Abbies out there . If the super structure 's compromised , this is our chance to survive . You and me . Like Adam and Eve . I thought you would want this . I can 't have children . Dr. Yedlin did some tests . There is some trauma . There is some scarring . From the Abby , the one that attacked you ? Yes . Are you sure ? It isn 't just Dr. Yedlin- - No . He wouldn 't lie about this . He knows how important it is to me . [ Kerry sobbing ] [ Kerry sobbing ] It 's okay . It 's okay . [ Kerry crying ] I 'm sorry . No , I 'm sorry . I wanted to have a child . Your child . I know . I 'm so proud of you for telling me . I just wish I had known . I would 've handled all this differently . I love you . I love you , too . [ gunshot ] [ groaning ] [ hissing ] [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] [ breathing heavily ] [ gasping ] Nice shot . I IVY " [ gasping ] I have to find a weakness near the fence , places where there might be unfinished tunnels . Like a pit ? When I was out there they had me in this pit , it was huge . We know where she 's headed . How did you get those ? I gave them to her . Here . Where the fence meets the eastern base of the mountain . The original town had a drainage system running from here to here . Pipes , tunnels- - How could she access the tunnels from outside the fence ? They can dig . Let 's go . [ whimpering ] [ growls ] Why are you keeping her here ? She is their leader . That is what the brand is for . They are gathering for her . They are coming for her , so we need to turn her over to them right now . [ low growl ] [ birds chirping ] She dug from outside until she intersected the drainage pipe . Hassler . - She took him . - Or he let her go . He didn 't let her do anything , none of us has . [ growling ] They 're gonna kill us all . Grenades ! Now ! Collapse the pipe ! [ soldier ] Alright , move , move ! [ beeping ] The bullet went right through you . Just missed your liver . Fortunately , thanks to the extremely high level of medical care- - Shut up , Oscar . Are we dead ? You 're alive . You should be okay . Are we dead ? I don 't know . Maybe . I think that having a happy and productive life in Wayward Pines is the most important contribution I can make to the preservation of our species , sir . I think that having a happy and productive life in Wayward Pines is the most important contribution I can make to the preservation of our species , sir . I think that having a happy and productive life ... in Wayward Pines , is the most important contribution I can make to the preservation of our species , sir . I think that having a happy and productive life ... [ hyperventilating ] ... sir . [ growling ] [ shrieking ] [ growling ] [ growling ] Okay . What did I do now , Theo ? Weapons ? Really ? You give weapons to civilians from your little stash . What did you want me to do , send them out unarmed ? They needed protection . - For God 's sake . - There 's a man who died , there 's another one in the hospital . And it did nothing ! She got away . - Good decision , son . - It 's not his fault . No ? Whose is it ? Who ? Margaret ? Jason ? This town ? Why is everything here someone else 's fault ? He was just trying to help , Theo . He 's sorry . That 's enough ? Accidents happen . That 's enough ? Yeah , it is . Sometimes , accidents happen here . [ grunts ] [ growling in the distance ] [ whimpering ] [ whimpering ] [ growling ] [ theme music playing ]

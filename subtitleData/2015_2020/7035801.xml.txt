He 's burning up . We have antibiotics , but without knowing exactly what it is ... Give him the antibiotics . Keep him alive . I know what you think of me . Yeah , I doubt it . Just drive . It wasn 't supposed to kill . It was just supposed to make the soldiers sick . Well , you missed that mark . So our people could come in unopposed - without bloodshed . - Your people ? We used to be your people . Nick was your friend . He shouldn 't have joined the Ottos . Listen to you . Set a world record for stockholm syndrome . I 'm not brainwashed . Nick might die .

It was me . I broke your parley 'cause you had my girl . I wasn 't gonna lose her and I won 't lose my son . - What was the poison ? - I told you when we met . You bought into a lost cause . - The Ottos are ... - I don 't give a shit ! I don 't care what you think about Otto or his son . I don 't give a damn about the feud or what you think about me . Do you care whether you live ? Oh , I 'm happy to die , take you with me . Unless you tell me what 's killing my son . Anthrax . No . Cultivated from animal hides . There 's no cure . This woman is more of a man than Jake Otto or any of his relatives . She 's free to leave . How old is your son ? He 's 19 . If he 's strong , he 'll live . My fight is not with you , madison . Leave the ranch . Take your family and go . We 've fought too hard , lost too much . We 're not running anymore . Then you 'll die . Oh , my God . Oh . Well , hello , angel . Morning , sunshine . It 's kind of like old times . It 's Anthrax . Did Ofelia tell you ? No , I returned her to the black hat . Walker told me . Those who don 't die will be too weak to hold a gun . They 'll attack while we 're down . Well , at least we know what we 're dealing with . All right , well , gather what 's left of the militia . Jake , there 's not much besides me . Just do what the hell you can , troy . Do something . - Recruit the able-bodied . - Madison , I 'm talking to my brother . - You don 't lead this ranch . - Jake ... You don 't lead this ranch ! Always the life of the party , mom . How you feeling , son ? Like I got hit by a truck . Madison 's right . Arm up everyone who 's not sick . We can talk to Walker . We can talk ? Talk is cheap without something to offer . And we already gave them our water reserves . War is the last resort . But we 're there . We have no leverage . I know a way we can get some . Ah . It 's good to be home ! There , come here . Put your head ... there we go . - - Head in . Is that better ? Yeah ? Hey . How you feeling ? Better . Fluids really helped , actually . I think I 'm ready to get out of this bed . Can you uncuff me ? No , can 't risk it , Nick . I 'm not gonna turn . I actually think other people might need this bed more , like maybe you . No , no , I 'm ... I 'm fine . It 's nothing . - Hey , you 're sick . - Shh . - Trade places with me . - No . Rest . People can 't see me suffering right now . They need me . You 're a good guy , Jake . Look , I can 't be strapped to a cot When we 're attacked , all right ? Take the bed , don 't take the bed . Can you please just let me outta here ? Hey , don 't get up too fast . Where 's your father ? Don 't bother with him . He won 't help . He 's burying the dead . Nick , he 's gonna disappoint you . Guy 's got his demons . I 'm not his judge . All this , this hell we 're in , It 's all because of him . - All right , ready ? Yeah . The clarks took me in . I cared about them , cared about Nick . You volunteered for what you did . You didn 't tell me it was Anthrax . You turned me into a killer . You saved lives by what you did at the ranch . You saved the entire nation . Here 's what I know . When I found you burned up in the desert , I almost passed you for dead . Why didn 't you ? My horse stopped . He sensed your spirit . When I got close , I felt your breath . I knew he was right . Smart horse . Smarter than me . Here was a woman who had faced death ... And wasn 't afraid . That 's why I brought you here . You saved my life . The debt is paid . Fire ! Fire ! ♪ ♪ Hurry ! Hurry ! We 're gonna go through all the water reserves , this rate . Come on . Mom . Go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Jesus , look at you , Standing there looking like some kind of ghoul . You shot up my floor . You said it had blood in it . Did I ? I was in my cups . I ... I 've been known to wax metaphoric . Who is this ? That 's a long story . Tell it to me . Well ... When Jake and troy were young boys , The local indian tribe decided that the ranch belonged to them . Sacred land or some sort of bullshit . Wasn 't bullshit to them , huh ? They sold the land to my family , got a square deal , But none of that stopped them young bucks from making trouble . Young bucks . Thugs , derelicts . Nothing better to do than steal from me And kill my cattle . I had two small children and a terrified wife . - So you killed one of them . - No . We killed three of them ... Phil , Russell , Vernon , and me . We camped out among the herd one night , And ... when the indians come up on us ... Well , one of them turns out to be Walker 's uncle . Him ? This is Walker 's uncle ? No . That son of a bitch is Walker 's father . He come by to find out what happened to his brother . Single shot did the trick . When we were fixing up the adobe And I was listening to your bullshit , I just thought you were some wizened aa cowboy . Did I hurt your feelings , son ? Oh ... I 'm truly sorry . You were just making sure those bodies stayed buried , huh ? They better stay buried . You 're a guest here , son . Get right with the past or get off my land . It 's their land . The land belongs to whoever can hold it . The indians couldn 't , gave it up for beer money . I held it , I hold it , So it 's mine . Well , the indians are coming . And Walker is coming for you . So , I guess we 'll see who can hold the land then . Dad . I know , I know . What the hell is this ? Bargaining power So Jake can make a deal . Well , I 'm not sure they 're in a negotiating mood . Walker values these relics . It 's a trailer full of rocks and beads and bullshit . You scared , Jeremiah ? Better be careful , son . You may not like my hospitality , But I guarantee you You 'll find it better than theirs . Does Jake know ? I think he suspects . It doesn 't change anything . It changes everything . We 're on the wrong side . Sides don 't matter . The only thing that matters is a future . A future built on this . Mom , I get what they did to Travis ... No , it 's not about that . I know you want to protect us from that . And I 'm with you , I am . But there has to be some things , Some line we don 't cross . Otherwise , we 're just like Otto . Otto 's alive . Troy 's alive . Troy 's alive because we lied for him . What ? He killed the trimbols . You knew ? Alicia ... Gretchen was an innocent . And you covered for her killer ? All your talk about family ? - I know it 's hard to understand . - It 's impossible to understand ! You 're just like them . You 're worse ! - You 're heartless ! - Don 't say that . - You don 't have feelings ! - Alicia ... No wonder dad was so depressed ! He was living with a Goddamn corpse ! Enough ! If I wasn 't busy keeping everyone else alive , I would have time for feelings . I 'd love that luxury . I 'd love to indulge myself . But someone has to be strong . Someone has to keep everyone else together . You have no idea what I carry . Hello ? Hello ? Hello , this is Cosmonaut Valery Stepanovich Vashchenko - of the Spacecraft Soyuz . - Holy sh ... holy shit . Hello ? Are you there ? Do you read ? Hello ? This is Victor Strand in Baja , California . I read you loud and clear . Uh , do you know what 's happened in North America , Mr. Vashchenko ? North America ? You sound like an American , my friend , Thinking everything happens only to him . So , it 's not just here ? I saw the lights go out on the world three days before my scheduled reentry . A dramatic show . I speak to you from my grave . I 'm sorry . At least you got to go to space . I doubt that anyone else will have the opportunity . I would give it all up for one last glass of vodka . How about champagne ? " I 'm dying . Haven 't had champagne in a long time . " Chekhov . Oh . His final words . " Either this wallpaper goes , or I do . " - Wilde . - Yes ! Uh ... " Born in a hotel room and God damn it ... died in a hotel room . " O 'neill ! Yes . " last words are for fools who have not said enough . " Marx . Karl marx . Tell me about your champagne , Victor Strand . It 's a ... a 1985 ... VDom Perignon vintage . Hello ? Mr. Vashchenko ? You are breaking up , my friend . The world turns . The world is dead . Nah , the world will not die until you die . Do not wait for your deathbed to enjoy your champagne , Victor . Have a glass for me . Mr. Vashchenko ? Dosvedanya . Your artifacts are unharmed . Why have you thrown in with this trash ? Explain that to me . You can 't always choose your people . We can end this , you and me . We return your artifacts to you , share what we have . In return , peace . We keep the ranch . This is indian land . It 's soaked in indian blood . Jeremiah Otto had his time . That time is over . I learned about your fight with the Ottos today from my son . He gave me something for your collection . I understand this is your father . Where did your son find this ? Buried under the old adobe . I 've been thinking on my ancestors Since you stole the reliquary . It 's not enough . This isn 't my father . This is an old white man 's shame . He doesn 't care about the relics . He wants the ranch . We have until sundown tomorrow to clear out . Or die . You two have never been to montgomery . No , you never took us . Not even when your mom died . No . There was a man there . A local councilman . And he had a beautiful wife and ... They had a lesome little girl . The girl knew everybody loved her daddy . Just ... they loved him ' cause he knew everyone 's name , All their kids ' names , Who went off to what college , Who was recovering from what illness . And he knew when to burn the ballot boxes . And which ones to burn . But what he didn 't know , what he never could learn ... Was when to turn down a drink . So , life was hard for the little girl . It was harder for her mother . As she grew , she got tired . Tired of the crying . Goddamn exhausted icing her mother 's face . Pulling out stitches 'cause her mama didn 't wanna go back to the emergency room . She just got tired . One morning , she ate her cereal . She brushed her teeth for school . She took the gun out of her daddy 's dresser . She shot him . Shot him while he slept off the night before . Yeah . My mama looked at me then like you 're looking at me now . I knew that was something I 'd have to carry . I 'd do it again . I 'd live with the look . I 'd do it a thousand times to protect her . To protect you . Mom ... I 'm gonna go talk to an old man , Convince him to set aside his pride , Make peace with the enemy . You 're gonna hole up in here . Still not much for knocking , huh ? I 'm going alamo , madison . Last line of defense . I built this house as a ... A hold-out in case we ever were overrun or under siege . Could be both . I got supplies and weapons in the basement . Your family 's welcome to hole up here - If it ever comes to it . - When it comes to it . Want a drink ? Come on , drink with me . Come on . I wanna thank you for standing by my boys and by troy , and for trying to stop what 's coming . Ah ! That 's good . Told Jake I couldn 't come to an agreement with Walker . That was a lie . There is one way to secure the peace . He probably wants my scalp , huh ? What ? You ... you here to kill me , madison ? I took you in , you and your kids when you were in need . You ate off of my table . I counseled your son ... Stopped him from chasing tail down to Mexico . I 'm not gonna kill you , Jeremiah , For all the reasons you said . Plus I think it 'd disappoint my kids . I 'm tired of disappointing them . So you 're gonna do it . Well ... I didn 't outlive Phil and Russell And two good women To die like some rabbit with no resistance . Walker has us surrounded with firepower . If you don 't do this , you lose the ranch . Well ... The ranch wasn 't meant to shelter cowards Scared of a few indians . No , it was meant to be your legacy . If you don 't do this , you lose that . Everyone dies . Including your sons . It 's your chance , Jeremiah , to make things up to them ... every neglect , every drunken rage . You can save their lives . To hell with them . One 's a feckless crybaby , and the other one 's a ... a chip off the old block . To hell with both of them . Now go on , get outta here . Leave me alone . No , my kids aren 't gonna die 'cause some old prick has too much hate and pride to do the right thing . Then kill me ! But your kids are here because this old prick had the balls to do what needed doing . Man , don 't anybody knock ? Here he is . Still clinging to his mama 's teat . You know what your mama came here to do tonight , hmm ? The reason why I like her so much , The reason she 's tougher than you 'll ever be is because she is ... exactly like ... I want you to do exactly as I say . No ... Hey .

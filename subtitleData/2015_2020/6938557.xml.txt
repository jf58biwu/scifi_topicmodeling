 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... It seems Radcliffe is keeping our team alive in this framework thing . Which means they can be rescued . So you just plug yourself in to these avatars ? Hook up with our people and find out where on earth their bodies are being held . Meet at the rendezvous right away . That 's where I programmed the backdoor to get out . Reality is just perception . They perceive it as real , which makes it real . They might not believe that . Yeah , but I do . I am saving these people . Lincoln ? Lincoln . What ? That a thing we do now ? Tell me it means you 're making the coffee . Ward . It 's , uh ... Sorry . You j ... You startled me . It 's not like I snuck in here . So , what 's up ? We got called in to work . Okay . I 'll get dressed . Weirdo . You know we 've spent more nights out tracking Inhumans than we 've had at home ? Bosses can 't give us a morning off ? Bosses . Mm . Who do you think 's running the ... Brief ? Well , I don 't know . You got the text . We should go there again . That was a fun trip . So , what 'd they say ? Skye , who texted ? Skye . Someone who knew you 'd sleep in . Pinsky . Probably another intake briefing . Don 't forget this . A kid arrested this morning ... An Inhuman , of course ... Was grabbed 10 feet from a public market . Just imagine what he was planning . And I have it on good authority that someone was hiding this Inhuman . I hope this subversive was strung up for treason . Unbelievable . To think ... You 're quiet . Are we okay ? Or what ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . I just , um ... oh , my god . Yeah , some mornings , the Triskelion looks so beautiful . Come on . We 're gonna be late . You can 't do this ! Sure we can , Inhuman ! Son of a ... Hey ! Get him up . They can handle it on their own . What are you doing ? You 're on another planet this morning . Look ... I get it . You put yourself out there last night , and I let you down . I 'm sorry . What are you apologizing for ? It 's been a few years . It makes sense to take this step . I would love to live with you . It 's just ... It 's not the right time . I asked you to move in ? I , um ... I mean , I did . And you 're right ... It 's a bad idea . I just need some time , some space . Skye ... There are things about me that you wouldn 't like if you knew . Trust me . I know . Skye . Ward . It 's that way . Kill me already . Hey , you ever finish the Saunders report ? Of course you did . I 'm gonna check my e-mail . Why ? Anyone who 's e-mailing you is gonna be in the briefing . Yeah , that 's why I want to get caught up . Okay . " Died during testing " ? What did they do ? Deceased ? No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , no . It can 't be . Can 't be what ? May . You 're here . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? I came looking for you . Get started with the briefing . No , no , no , may , it 's me . I ... I got into the framework . I don 't care what you 've hacked . May , look at me . It 's me ... it 's D ... Do I have to get you drug-tested ? Get in the briefing . Sorry . I 'll come now . I was murdered ? Aah ! S.H.I.E.L.D. fell . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Are you okay ? Thank you . I need help . Please . Okay . Yeah . Get in , get in . I 'm Jemma . I 'm ... I 'm Julia . Uh , where can I take you ? D.C. ? Is o ... is that okay ? Yes , thank you . Anywhere but here . Yeah . That 's a really dangerous area . What were you doing there ? It was dreadful . No , I 'm ... I 'm fine . It 's ... Complicated . It 's okay . I didn 't ... Whatever happened , I didn 't mean to push . Right . Yeah , well ... Better we don 't . What about you ? What are you ... Into ? Me ? I 'm boring . I wait tables for now . But I make these . They 're kind of cool . You make art ? Fascinating . So incredibly lifelike . It 's nothing special . It 's just side money for med school . I always dreamed of helping people . You have dreams . This is all so real . So many computational layers . What 's wrong ? It 's a new Inhuman checkpoint . They take forever , but it 's worth it . They can ... Test for Inhuman DNA , pre-terrigenesis ? Don 't they do that everywhere ? I mean , it freaked me out the first time , but they just check I.D.S here . I don 't have one . I must have lost it back there . No , no , no . You need ... you need your ID . Like , you need it . I 'm ... Sorry . I ... I don 't ... I don 't have it . Jemma , they 're gonna arrest us . Well ... Okay . Well , okay , wait . Let 's just ... Oh , here we go . S.H.I.E.L.D. no . Y-you 're one of them . Wait . No , no , no . Listen . Get out . No , no , please . You lied to me . Please , please , please . Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! I just need to find my friend Daisy . Can I use your phone ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Please ! I 'm sorry ! Just please close the door . No . No . I warned you not to be late . Shut up ... Pinsky . Let 's start . We 've got an Inhuman gene-positive detainee , possibly linked to subversive groups . The doctor wants this fast-tracked . Don 't disappoint him . Subject is Jason Rajan of Deanwood . We believe he 's funneling terrigen to subversives . Look who 's perking up . You know this guy ? No . Then get to know him . You and ward take point . I want this Intel at any cost . You 're in a very precarious position , Mr. Rajan . Inhuman status isn 't a crime . But lying about it is . I never lied . We 'll see about that . Hydra cares more about what you 've done than what you are . So when my partner here asks you about smuggling charges ... I highly suggest you cooperate . Your name is Jason Rajan , born in Edison , New Jersey ? Yes . Did you know that you were an Inhuman before today ? Yes . And it says that you own an import business , but Hydra surveillance says one of your trucks is missing . Where is it ? I don 't know . It was stolen . Was stolen , but you didn 't file a police report . I 'm an Inhuman . I was afraid to talk to the authorities . What was stored in the truck , Mr. Rajan ? I don 't know . I don 't deal directly with those kinds of shipments . Bull . Where is the truck ? Forget about the truck . This guy 's never seen terrigen before in his life . Hydra-issued citizen 's card . But I know for a fact that your name isn 't Jason Rajan , so I wonder , who made it ? It 's not possible . Exactly . Unless someone within Hydra provided it . I am trying to save your life . So tell me ... Is there a threat within Hydra ? You never helped anyone , you bitch ! Give me the terrigen , and I 'll show you a threat . Someone in Hydra make this for you ? Your name is Vijay Nadeer . Don 't deny it . My DNA is not a crime . I 'm not a criminal . You should know ... Ward ! What ... At least we broke him . Not one smartphone . Hey , come on . Really ? It 's not my fault . Oh . Are you all right , ma 'am ? I 'm great . Thank you . Rough day ? Oh , I was just hiking . I tripped . So clumsy . Everything okay ? Oh , our , uh , friend here went hiking . Oh , yeah ? In a dumpster or ... ? Well , that 's not very nice . No , I fell . And I just want to get home . I 'll need to see your I.D. Yeah . Okay . Oh . I must have lost it in the fall , I guess . Hmm . Come with us , please . Let 's start with your name . Name . Simmons . Jemma Simmons . You got that ? Got it . You 're lying about something . I can see it . Based on what ? My ... my clothes ? My accent ? I told you , I lost my I.D. I-it says here she 's a dead girl . False identification . Big trouble . But it 's her picture . Ohh ! This is a dangerous world . The Cambridge incident proved that . To understand this , you have to imagine individuals over the state . It was a mess . People were divided . They had their own truths , their own media , their own agendas . There were so many untruths about Inhumans out there that some people saw them as these magical , heroic creatures , like unicorns . It was terrifying . Then , you had a weak state that allowed a refugee from Bahrain , a girl , sympathetic . Even though S.H.I.E.L.D. knew she was Inhuman , they brought her back to the states and put her into a classroom . The rest is history . But what inspires me is the way our country reacted , the way we came together . When no one would tell us the truth , Hydra stepped forward . They brought us law and order , purpose . They galvanized us for the good of the state over individual interests . They ... yeah , Burnell . But , sir , isn 't it true that Hydra came from Nazis ? That 's not true . Never say that . Okay , but weren 't they the Nazis ' science division ? Anyone who 's informed knows ... That Hydra originated centuries ago . So they couldn 't be Nazis . That 's just propaganda . But this is good . This shows how important it is to separate fact from innuendo . Before the incident , there were over 1,500 newspapers , some of them ... Mr. Coulson ? Sorry to interrupt . I 'm sorry . How can I help you ? Yeah , Chris Adler . Chris ? We 're just gonna run a few tests . Wait , Chris . - Yes , Mr. Coulson ? Don 't forget your bag , son . Oh . I 'll take that . Okay . Let 's get back to the lesson . You got quiet , Vijay . It 's probably because of his broken jaw . No more games . You 're her . I know you . - I doubt it . All Inhumans know you . Bahrain . It 's funny , 'cause the world blames Inhumans for what happened . But it was you that got it wrong . May ! May , don 't do this . This isn 't you . May , wake up ! What ? - He 's valuable to us . Take him upstairs for testing . - Yes , ma 'am . The doctor will get answers . No . Just ... not him . No ! No ! Come on ! No ! Not the doctor , okay ? I-I 'll talk ! All right , you 're right ! All right ? The I.D. was real . Shut up , shut up , shut up . What did you mean when you were talking to agent may ? The Bahrain op was a success . God , you have a sick measure of success . I 'm sorry if she killed an Inhuman child , but if it saved everyone else ... If that girl had been taken down in Bahrain , she wouldn 't have gone on to kill all those people in Cambridge . Thanks to your friend back there , Hydra has a green light to exterminate Inhumans . Okay . Listen , I know you don 't trust me , but I can help you get out of here . Oh , really ? You should avoid saying that under the cameras . Ohh ! Aah ! Vijay ! Vijay ! We have him , doctor . Fitz . You lost control of your prisoner . I ... Would 've caught him . Follow me . Thank goodness . Oh . Come on , Daisy . Come on . There you are , sir . I 'm coming . Coulson . Yes ? It 's so , so good to see you , sir . I 'm sorry . Have we met ? Are you ... ? Please don 't say you were a student . You don 't remember me , do you ? Uh , I 'm Jemma . It 's Jemma ... Jemma Simmons , sir . It 's been such a horrible day , and when I saw where you were , I hoped that you ... Horrible ? Did something happen ? Should I call someone ? No , please don 't call anyone . I-I just need to talk to you . I don 't understand . W-when did you say we met ? In the real world . Before you were ever a teacher . Unless you count summers lifeguarding , I 've always been a teacher . You see , you think that . You think that you were , but no . It 's ... Oh , there 's no sane way to say it , so ... Do you have moments where reality isn 't quite right ? Like y-your memories don 't fit ? Who are you ? Simmons . I know I sound like a lunatic , but you have had your mind wiped and implanted with false memories . Okay . It 's time to leave . No , please , you ... you need to hear this . I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. You were the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. You destroyed Hydra . And now you 're ... You 're ... you 're trapped in a virtual prison , and I am here to wake you up . Put that away before we both get arrested . What is this ? Is this a test ? Because it 's not gonna work . I 'm loyal to Hydra . I 'm just a teacher . Yes , you are a teacher ! You ... you are a teacher , and a ... and a ... And a leader and ... Oh , y-you 're a great man , and you shouldn 't be here ! I have no way to prove it . Not yet . I need to ... I need to go back ... Please , get yourself some help . And whatever you do , don 't talk about S.H.I.E.L.D. Tahiti . No . No , that 's Hawaiian . Remember Tahiti . It 's a magical place . Why did you say that ? It 's a magical place . This isn 't an accident . Your memory 's been rewritten before ! You are Phil Coulson , agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , and your subconscious knows that ! You need to go . You need to remember me ! And Fitz and agent may and all the good that we have done ! Your friends depend on you , and this world is a lie ! I have tried to be nice to you , but that 's enough ! I don 't know you . Now leave . Okay . I 'll go . But I am not giving up on you , sir . Yes , I 'd like to report a subversive . Hey ! What are you doing ? You tagged my car . I can 't drive this now . - I didn 't tag it . You 're holding the can . What can ? I ... I mean , that 's how Hydra does it , right ? You and Mr. Coulson , I mean , y 'all lie to us every day . You know , th-that Hydra isn 't a bunch of Nazis , and ... and that you don 't steal kids out of school ? You think I 'm Hydra . I saw you talking to Coulson ! Where 's Chris ? You know , go ahead . Take me to him . 'Cause if not , I 'm gonna find the resistance and come after all of you . I don 't ha ... ah . You 're not even real , you rogue piece of code ! This is ... this is all fake ! It 's a virtual world . I don 't mean that . Look at me . Do I look like I 'm Hydra ? You look like a bag lady . I 'm Jemma . Coulson let Hydra take your friend ? Damn . You know , Coulson used to fight Hydra . He was as brave as you and got into more trouble and even trained me well enough to steal this car . Coulson ? You 're crazy . Look , I mean , they 're definitely gonna stop you now . Well , have at it . And for the record , Hydra ? They 're all Nazis . Hey . Look ... I trashed your car . You can borrow mine . You 're sure ? Are Hydra all Nazis ? Every last one of them . And don 't you let anyone forget it . Now , with this machine , we can test Inhuman powers without any side effects . It seems like it 's ... Burning him . There are side effects . Well , yes . I meant , we can determine their powers without permanently triggering terrigenesis in the subject . We 'll change the world . Fitz , this is wrong . This ... this is crimes-against-humanity wrong . These are Inhumans . You 've been a great asset , Skye , but unless I ask for your opinion ... Don 't give it . How are things going with Grant ward ? They 're good . I noticed your application for co-habitation had been approved . Yes . Sir , there 's a report you need to see . Subversive activity at a school ... A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID . Really ? The report was called in by a teacher ... Phillip Coulson . Who 's the girl ? Suspect was in her mid 20s , British . Did you get her name ? Where was this ? You can go . I want any and all assets in the area on this . Hey . What 's up ? We get a call ? No , I just have some stuff to do . Stuff . Really ? Skye , you never leave early . You 've been pissed at me all morning . Your attitude at work here sucks . It 's like I woke up to a totally different person . You know what ? You 're right . I 'm pissed . I tried to get closer to you in our relationship , and you shut me down because you said you needed space . Fine . Take all the space you need , but right now , I need my own . It 's a magical place . No . - Daisy ! - Jemma ! Oh , I was so worried . Wait . You 're Hydra ? It 's a long story . I saw that you were dead . Wait . Are you still dead ? No , I 'm feeling much better . So you 're okay . Yeah . You were supposed to be buried in the U.K. More like a mass grave at the academy . The story 's a cover-up . I think Hydra murdered me . Did you find the extraction beacon ? Exactly where we programmed it . Okay . We have to get out of here . Hydra is after you . We have to get somewhere safe . Coulson gave me up , didn 't he ? He 's completely different , Daisy . You wouldn 't believe it . He let Hydra arrest a child . May 's different , too . She 's like number three in Hydra and way more damaged than in the real world . Everything 's worse here . I woke up buried alive , was ditched on the side of the road , nearly arrested , and found Coulson brainwashing the young . It sounds bad , but wait till you hear how I woke up . Why did Radcliffe build this place ? He was never into Hydra . Ladies . Ward . We need to talk . How did you know my name ? Who are you ? Skye , what have you told her ? So it 's Skye again . You have another name ? No . I 'm Skye . Why 's Hydra after her ? Is she your source in the resistance ? What source ? No , she 's a friend . What is he doing here ? All right , let 's go ! Down this trail ! Daisy , they 're coming . You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Ward , look at me . I have never betrayed you , ever . We 're real . Is she your source for the resistance ? No ! No ! Ward , I have nothing to do with the resistance ! Down this trail ! Unh ! Well , I do . Come on . We got to get out of here . Come on ! Use lethal force if necessary ! We got move ... now ! Whose car is this ? Mine . Keys , now ! What ? No ! Keys , or we all die ! What the hell is going on ? ! No idea . Hang on . Skye , there 's no good way to tell you this , but ... I had the test results when you were screened . You 're an Inhuman . I know . You know ? Cover us ! So , you 're Hydra , and you 've been protecting Skye ? Yeah . That 's why I joined the resistance . Oh , always the double agent . And this is who you woke up with ? You two were together ? Oh , this isn 't the framework . This is hell . They 're gaining on us ! How did you know Vijay Nadeer 's real name ? Why do you care ? I was the one who got his ID cards ! You 're a mole ? What a surprise . You knocked him out to shut him up . Yeah . He was helpful until you burned him . Hold on ! What are you doing ? We 'll get stuck . Drones will be here any second . Drones ? Dwarfs , whatever . The doctor invented them . They 're everywhere . - Oh . Metro 's just up those steps . Two stops to your apartment . You 'll be safe there . I 'll clear the car . Go , go , go . Ward ... I 'm sorry about Vijay . I got caught up , and I ... I had to give may something . I didn 't know it could be you . What is your name ? Daisy . We 'll talk . Get out of here . Go . One agent was killed . The others lost the vehicle in Bethesda . We 're canvassing the area . It was one girl . One girl with help , who knew our tactics . Maybe whoever helped her ... Also made this . It 's not a forgery . A mole . Well , that 's a serious charge . Someone is betraying us . You know , my father always said you have to have trust to be betrayed . Treat this mole like a cancer . I 'll cut it out myself . Well , you failed before . Never forget how it felt at Cambridge . Did the dwarfs record these people ? The footage was sent straight to the director . By request . You saw Fitz , didn 't you ? Is he like the others ? Brainwashed ? Yeah , he was ... Different . But , Simmons , they all are . It 's scary . Why change things like this ? It makes no sense . Radcliffe tried to take away people 's pain in the framework . Wait . You 're right . May 's biggest pain was killing the girl in Bahrain . You take that away , and hundreds of kids are killed in Boston . And Coulson is leading a quiet life . I 'm worried he 's not the same man . He really let them take a kid ? And what did they do to Fitz to make him such an ugly person here ? Well , that one 's easy . They stole you from his life . What if he never knew me ? What if he can 't remember ? This ... this reality is flawless . It lures you in . I know , I know . Can 't even believe what I found myself doing . I ... I looked up Lincoln . I ... I ... I interrogated Vijay for being an Inhuman . And I have been here one day . May 's been here weeks . She thinks it 's her whole life . A few choices and a few lives . Radcliffe ran a simulation . Now it 's a brave new terrifying world . Okay . Um ... We need to get out . What ? N ... No , we can 't leave them . We have to talk to yo-yo and come back with a game plan , with backup . I don 't have powers here . Okay . Why are we still here ? I 'm not sure . This should disconnect us from the framework , wake us up . They know we 're here . You 're supposed to be dead . Someone re-coded our exit . We 're trapped . Good evening , madame . Leopold . Come in . These ... Subversives need to be taken seriously . Apparently , they 've got a mole inside Hydra . A traitor . I know . I 've tightened security . Eliminated a loophole for their escape . Next , we tighten the noose . So , you have surveillance on ... ? On one of them , yes . I 'd like to see it . - No . Your work is too important to be distracted by these criminals . I won 't stand by as they try to destroy everything that we have built . I have to protect that . I have to protect you . I have ... Your anger won 't solve this . It 's your creativity that we need . Hey . Who are you ? Are you with the other person ? This is not okay . Coulson ... I need you to remember me . I 'm sorry . We haven 't met . We have . Please ... Remember me . No . This isn 't real . You 're not here . I am . I am . Please . Remember me . I 'm sorry . I don 't . It 's not your fault . It 's just ... You 're the person that I go to when things get heavy . And this world is scary , and nothing makes sense , and ... You 're the closest thing I have to family . So I just hope that deep down , you feel it , too . Daisy ?

 Previously on Travelers ... We 're off mission . Stand down ! No plan survives contact with the past . You must be new . We just got this security-camera footage from outside the library . Has Marcy been acting differently lately ? No . How are you supposed to throw a football with a broken hand ? Please stop . What is wrong with him ? Whoa , Philip . And all these people are going to die ? Yeah . I know this person . I 'm starting to think whoever they 're buying from ain 't gonna show . It 's all about patience . That 's what you said with the Jonas Walker case , and he fell off the face of the Earth . You 're going to have to let that one go , partner . Yeah , I know , I know . I 'm like a dog with a bone , I guess . Hello . What are they selling , car parts ? Looks good . That 's a hell of a lot of money for car parts . Multiple shots fired ! 65 Heward Drive . We need back-up right away ! - What about the back-up ? - Can 't wait ! FBI ! Drop your weapons ! No ! Drop your weapons ! All responding units , be advised , there 's a damaged Mercedes leaving this location with three armed men , two of them badly injured . Intercept and detain if possible ! Traveler ... 34 ... 68 . Support required . Coordinates 47 degrees , 14 minutes , 35.045 seconds . Make and model confirmed . Units are en route . ... 07 seconds . End of message . You wait for the back-up . I 'm going after them ! It 's a damn mess . Philip , you there ? Hey , boss . What are you doing right now ? Oh , you know ... healing from a gunshot wound , watching old news with Marcy . I need you to direct me to 47 degrees , 14 minutes , 35.045 seconds by 122 degrees , 22 minutes , 13.407 seconds . - You got it ? - On it . Why ? What ... What 's happening ? I just got the most bizarre messenger . They 're all bizarre to me . Yeah , well , this message came from the mouth of a dying man ... a traveler team in need of assistance at those coordinates . It 's on its way to you now . We 'll meet you there . Uh , nope , Philip 's not going anywhere in his shape , but I will be there in 10 . Pick up Carly on the way . Come armed . Bring your full medical kit . You 're at the coordinates . Should be an old warehouse on your left . How far out are Carly and Marcy ? Uh , five minutes . Make sure they wait for my all-clear . Understood . Drop your weapon . - I 'm here to help . - Shut up . He 's one of the FBI agents . Yeah . Who you shot at . Thanks very much . Whatever happened to Protocol 3 ? I 'm Traveler 3468 . I received a message to come to these coordinates and give support . Who delivered the message ? One of the Russians . Well , that 's bullshit , 'cause that would ... that would kill an adult . It did . The Director must 've figured he was dying anyway . You want my help or not ? I 'm Rick Hall . This is Carter . That 's my boy , Luca , on the table . Grant MacLaren . My medic 's on the way . Well , that 's good , ' cause ours is dead . What is this ? What happened ? Well , our mission was to acquire a component from Russian travelers and deliver it to another team for testing . The Russians ' historian was dead , so they were out of cash . We were then instructed to finance them in exchange for the hand-off , but they got greedy . A traveler team turned on you ? He must be new . Yeah . They went rogue . Tried to take our money and the component , probably sell it somewhere else , and busted it in the process . You saw the rest . Now where 's the medic ? Carly , Marcy ... you have the all-clear to enter the building upon arrival . One minute out . They 're moments away . So how badly damaged is it ? I don 't know . It 's not my expertise . It was a good plan , if the Russians hadn 't gone rogue . Yeah , then the FBI would 've busted you . Doesn 't sound like a great plan to me . Oh , shit . We 're coming in . It 's all right . What can you tell me ? Gunshot wound to the abdomen . There 's no exit wound . This is Luca . That 's Carter . I 'm Hall . Mr. Hall is their team leader . You can put your weapon away now . He 's lost a lot of blood and still hemorrhaging . I think the only thing I can do is get him stable before we get him to a hospital . No . No hospitals . He 's wanted by the police . They both are . Well , I don 't have anywhere near the proper resources . Well , obviously , the Director thinks you do , or you wouldn 't be here , would you ? All right . Go ahead and put him out . Can you get me light , please ? All right , all right . Okay , warm up the laser and get him on plasma . What happened ? He got shot in the gut . No . I 'm talking about you . Let me see . Ah ! Goddammit ! I don 't think that you understand how serious your injuries are . Stop worrying about me and help Luca . It 's Forbes . Do your thing . MacLaren . We 've got three dead bodies . All of them ghosts in the system . Really ? Any word on the whereabouts of that car that I was pursuing ? That 's what I 'm calling to ask you . No , no . They had too big a lead . I was just about to get back to local enforcement . All right , let me know what you hear . Will do . I can 't locate the bullet . I think the only thing that I can do is cauterize the torn vessels ... Just get the bullet out of him . I am telling you that if I operate now , I will kill him . Your friend , Carter , is coughing up blood because his internal bleeding includes his lungs . I 'm telling you that he 's dying , he can 't be saved . The man is an ox ! He just carried ... Shut up and listen to me ! Okay ? This is time-sensitive . Luca has lost close to 40 % of his blood . He won 't survive any sort of surgery without a donor . So if we act now , we can use Carter 's blood to save Luca 's life . I have a blood-type converter , I 'm telling you I can 't save them both . So we either watch the two of them die , or Carter saves Luca 's life ... those are your options . You need to decide before Carter goes septic and his blood 's not good to anyone . - Mr. Hall ... - I Hear you ! Relax . Just give me a second , please . I have to make sure the FBI doesn 't show up here . Now , look , if I don 't do something to throw Forbes off ... Do what you need to do . I 'll be operating into the early hours . Carly can assist . Mr. Hall can handle anything that comes up . All right . Looking good , Trev . How 's that feel ? Oh , it feels great . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Let 's see what you got in the tank ! Wow . Man , you 're flying ! You 'll be back on the team in no time . Trevor ? Can I talk to you ? Ms. Day ? How can I help you ? Actually , I would like to help you . I 've been looking over your transcripts and there are some things we need to talk about . What is it ? Well , it 's kind of a bigger conversation that I 'd like to have with you and your parents . You know , the whole team . I like to think that I can have these conversations on my own . Well , you 're 17 , so . I 've set a meeting with them for fourth period today . I 'll expect to see you there . I 'll be there . All right . Hey ! A little help ? Let 's see if you 've still got it ! What are you doing here ? No " Hey , Jeff . " No " Good morning . " I get " What are you doing here ? " Looks like my son spent another night at the babysitter 's while you were out with your new man , hmm ? You think I haven 't seen that white dude around ? Is that how you got these new wheels ? You got a sugar daddy ? That 's none of your business . Carly . We gotta talk about this family . We 're not a family . Mother , father , and son . Mother , son , abusive biological father . - That 's cold . - It 's accurate . So you 're gonna throw away everything that 's good between us because one night I had a bit too much to drink ? I 'm leaving now . Oh , Carly , come on . Come on . You know we got a connection , right ? You gonna tell me you don 't miss this ? - Don 't , Jeff . - I do . Ho , ho , ho ... ow ! Oh ... This ... is where any idea you have of " us " ends . Right now . You do not touch me . Are we clear ? I still got a right to see my kid . And your kid has a right to child support . Don 't come near us again without it . You 've changed , Carly . You 're like ... You 're like a completely different person . That 's something that should 've happened a long time ago . Bitch . Bitch ! Hey , kid ? Hey . Got your drugs . Why don 't you knock next time ? Why don 't you lock the door ? You 're welcome , by the way . If you 're smart , there 's about three weeks ' worth of Percocet there . Although , you know , uh , trading one addiction for another never works . Uh , you look , uh ... not so good . Like somebody beat you up . Did somebody beat you up ? I 'm fine . You don 't look fine . You look like a piece of ... Holy shit . What is this ? It 's nothing . It 's insanity . Hey . It 's the gambling matrix , right ? This is how you do it , isn 't it ? It 's really nothing . There are dates up here that are months from now . How much research do y ... ? No ! Don 't ... ! Don 't . Why don 't you give me a tip ? Gimme a little tip . Come on . Can you just leave ? Please ? Either you give me a tip , or you tell me what this is all about on the wall over here , all right ? 'Cause you got all of that , and you 're giving me , like , crumbs . Come on , man . You 'd be in jail right now if it wasn 't for me . You know that . Hey , Luca , it 's okay ! Hey , I 'm right here . I 'm right here . I need you to wake up and listen to me , Luca . I need you to wake up , all right ? Wake up , Luca . - Luca ? - No . Luca , wake up . Agh ! Get it out ! No ! No ! Get it off me ! Get it out of me ! Wake up ! Luca ! Wake up ! Ms. Warton . I 'm Officer Conniker . I tried to contact you earlier . I 'd just like to speak with you about the incident outside the library . What incident ? The boys that assaulted you and another employee ? Listen , I understand that you didn 't report it , and that 's not unusual with assault cases , but I ... I saw the closed circuit television footage . Caught both assaults and you kicking their asses . Not that you 'd be in any trouble for retaliating . What I saw was actually damn impressive . Well , I 'd like to move on . Uh-huh . Listen . Have you sought counseling of any kind ? Everything 's fine . I don 't need counseling . So then why are you living with this social worker ? Excuse me ? Not that you 're to blame in any way , but I should inform you that should a state mental health worker be found guilty of inappropriate fraternization with a client , especially one with developmental issues ... Do I look like I have developmental issues , officer ? That 's not for me to judge . I 'm just saying that 'd be grounds for termination , if not worse ... litigation . Just so you understand the consequences . You gonna take that , or ... ? Uh , yeah . If you 'll excuse me . This is Marcy . What happened ? He was fine when I left . Night terrors . Sometimes they 're too real . Yeah , one minute he 's sleeping , and the next , he 's screaming . He almost killed me once . All right , well , let 's get you closed up again . Mac . We got ' em . Got who ? Our friends from last night . Located ' em right here in town . We had leads that had them leaving the city . Yeah , I did some digging anyway . Ran the plates on the car that left the scene . It belongs to a Sergeant Rick Hall . Served in Iraq , lives in Portland . Had some agents go check out his place this morning . Hall hasn 't been there in weeks . Pulled him up on the database . He owns three other properties . Place in Austin , condo in Vancouver , and a warehouse right here in town . Checked out the freeway CCTV footage ... And ... Nice work . Let 's file for a warrant and get down there , huh ? Already got it . Suit up . Right ! I 'll meet you downstairs in a minute . All right . Marcy , it 's MacLaren . I don 't know . I just got word from MacLaren . The FBI are on their way . We have maybe 20 minutes . Isn 't MacLaren with the FBI ? Yeah , and he obfuscated the best he could , but his partner found your name on the deed to this building and tracked your vehicle here . Okay , well , you ... you tell him he 's got to stop them . There 's only so much he can do without blowing his cover . We 're wasting time ! Are you being serious right now ? Are you kidding me ? What about us ? Luca shouldn 't even be moved ! I will be there ! I 'm okay . We should go . They 're on their way . We need to move . What I 'd like to do is change the conversation from Trevor 's football career and focus on his grades . If he has a football career , he doesn 't need grades . Tabling that a moment , I think it 's important for you to understand that Trevor needs to start doing much better ... - ... if he hopes to graduate . - Trevor , we need you outside the school and ready to go in three minutes . We 've got a mission . ... Are you prepared to do the work ? I can do that . Good . Carly will be outside to pick you up . ... Time on his homework and less watching Internet porn . Understood , no more porn . What ? Don 't embarrass the kid . The apple doesn 't fall far from the tree , Gary . Ms. Day ? I know you probably have a lot you want to talk about without me in the room , so I should give you a chance to do that . All I have to say is that I fully intend to raise my grades and focus on the sciences , and I have no intention of playing football again . - What ? - Sorry , Gary . " Gary " ? Thank you for your time and concern . But Trevor , we 're not finished here . - Trevor ! - You 're playing football ! I 'm sorry . He 's just been so different since the concussion . Can I have one of those ? Do you think you can sit up for me ? All right . There you go . Okay . I need you to hold this bag above your heart , okay ? Is that Carter ? He saved your life . Above your heart , okay ? Nice and easy ! The wound is fragile . All right . It 's time . We gotta go . Okay . Reminder ... these men are dangerous . Approach with extreme caution . Breathe , man . You used to love this shit in the old days . I wasn 't very bright in the old days . Fall back ! Fall back ! You okay ? You should warn us . Hey , come on . You would 've told him . MacLaren had to be as surprised as the rest of them . Don 't worry about it . They 're fine . They could 've been hurt . It had to be done ! We would 've left too much back there that might 've incriminated ... Jesus , what is that ? Is that a baby ? - Whose baby is that ? - Mine . - You take him on missions ? - Oh , not if I can help it , but somebody needed to come save your ass . He has your eyes , Carly . He really does . I just hope we can fix it . It 's a key component . Tell me this kid knows what he 's doing . This kid is older than all of us put together . What the hell was that ? You nearly killed my men ! They 're not your men . Do you even give a damn about Protocol 3 ? Was anybody killed ? You nearly killed me ! Yet here you are , MacLaren ! Look , if you 'd done your job properly , the FBI wouldn 't have found us in the first place . I can only throw them off the scent for so long ! Forbes is a good cop . Well , maybe I should 've waited for your friend , Forbes , to open the door before I set it off . What ? It was our base of operations ! I had to get rid of the evidence ! You almost got ... Okay ! Okay , okay . It 's done . You 're alive . Yeah . Have you slept ? You look exhausted . I am , but I 'll live , so will my patient . - It 's not an easy fix . - But we can do it . Well , you damn well better . Don 't talk to my team like that ! Or what ? What 're you gonna do ? Okay ! All right ! All right ! Hey ! They just need some time to work . Let 's give them some space . What is it ? I 'm grounded . You know , I was tempted to break his nose on your behalf , but I held it together . You and me both . I don 't know . The Director obviously thinks he and his team are worth saving , but ... I gotta get back to work . This bomb isn 't exactly gonna De-escalate the investigation . I gotta call my babysitter . Hey . Can I get on our computer ? Uh ... Is there something you need ? I 'll do it , just get me on . I need to set the drop-off coordinates with the other team , if that 's okay with you . I guess . Well , thank you so much . How are you feeling , Luca ? Better . Thanks . Hey , uh , how long have you had night terrors ? Since I was a kid . I know it 's hard for some people to understand . No . I do . My brother used to get them all the time , growing up . Your brother ? Mm-hmm . Uh , get some rest , okay ? Yeah . Hey . Can I talk to you for a second ? About what ? When I was really young , there was an emergency evacuation in my shelter block . I was separated from my brother ... So ? So ... one of the things that I remember about him is he used to suffer from night terrors . I just thought , there 's only so many of us ... Leave the future in the past , Doctor . Protocol 2 . I understand that , but if it 's at all possible ... I don 't think you understand . I don 't think you understand a goddamn thing . I don 't think any of you do ! Look . We came here with a team of five , just like you . You know , we all made it , which is rarer than you think , believe it or not , but we 're down to two now . What does that mean to you ? Uh ... two more to go ? When you have been doing this as long as we have , doing whatever the Director tells you , without question ... building devices for missions , rigging elections , saving people ... and by the way , killing people , too ... don 't think the future doesn 't get its hands dirty . To do this job , to stay alive , you need to be focused . We 're very focused , Mr. Hall . Focused ? You 're a bunch of tourists ! He 's a junkie ! Don 't think I haven 't seen fresh track marks before . You 're worried about your parents grounding you , for Christ 's sake ! Your tactician brings an infant to the missions , and MacLaren ... Hah ! MacLaren doesn 't even know what side he 's on ! Well , I thought we were all supposed to be on the same side . I need you to be committed to the mission , whatever the mission ! Protocol 1 is the only one that matters , and that 's what you guys aren 't getting ! And the reason you 're not getting that because your priorities are all outta whack ! Now I need this team , right here , right now , to get on side , or I cannot trust you . Is there a problem ? - No ! - Yes ! Mr. Hall here doesn 't seem to think that we know what we 're doing . I am just trying to help your people understand how things are around here . Oh , we understand how it is , Mr. Hall . We really do . I hope so . Knock-knock ? Kat . You really are here . Yeah , I-I texted you . Yes , you did . How romantic . Since this is usually date night , I thought I 'd bring you some Chinese and make you take a break . Don 't worry , it 's vegetarian . Well , that is romantic . Mm . I 'm sorry about tonight . I-I know it 's been crazy busy . I just ... we don 't have enough manpower . Oh , come on , I am happy to share you with your work , babe . I always have been . As long as that 's all I 'm competing with . What does that mean ? Well , it has been an awfully long time . Yeah , I know . Hey . Hey . You still look like shit . Thanks . Who 's that you 're with ? A friend . Kinda looks like a cop car . Yeah , it does a little , doesn 't it ? So which one is it ? Right here . That 's great . Thanks for doing this . Yeah . Keys ? Oh ... Where 's my money ? I transferred your money . Yeah , you transferred me the rent , now you owe me 8 % commission . 8 % what ? And , uh , bets for tomorrow . I gave you bets yesterday . Yeah , but I got a little ambitious . I can 't keep doing this , Ray . You know what ? I can 't keep being your errand boy . Come on , bud . Show me a little respect . Look at everything I do for you on a daily basis . I bring you drugs . I show you houses . You don 't even tell me your system . Okay , 10 % . 10 % . What 's that work out to ? Give me the keys . Who 's this house for , anyway ? It 's a safe house for time travelers . Them again , huh ? All right . It 's better I don 't know . Here you go . Did your host have a family ? Sort of . Not really . She had , um ... David . His name is David . He took care of my host before I arrived . What ? Like a butler ? Your host rich ? No , she just needed assistance with some things . What about you ? Wife ? Kids ? That should do it . Looks different . It 'll work . Hall , we found you a safe house . It 's time to go . Don 't let the door hit your ass on the way out ? What happened to " we 're all on the same side " ? I don 't wanna be in the same room . Listen , we 're all gonna get along . You 'll see . Where 's Luca and Marcy ? They went for a walk . Marcy said that he had to keep moving to prevent clotting . Okay . Soon as they get back . Are you sure that 's the Director 's intention ? 'Cause I 'm just ... I 'm just asking a question . Have you received instructions from the Director to relocate my team ? No , I haven 't . Okay , well , the Director put us together for a reason . You 're splitting us up , why ? Protocol 6 . Oh , listen to the boy scout quoting his protocols . I know the rules , MacLaren . " Traveler teams should stay apart unless instructed otherwise . " Well , guess what ? You were instructed otherwise . I think you know that I have seniority here . I should be leading this team . MacLaren . We I.D. ' d all the bodies now . Counting the Russians and the guy we found scorched in the warehouse , that 's four . That leaves two still out there . Well , one of them 's this " Rick Hall " character . Who 's the other one ? Ah , the system just pulled him up on an ABM camera in the East End . I 'll send a picture to your phone . Guy 's name is Luca Shun . We got him working 15 years as a sous chef in Portland , then all of a sudden , he 's wanted upstate for petty theft and assault charges . I 'm following a lead on Hall . I 'll let you know what I find . All right . Agent Forbes ? I told you he was a good cop . Marcy , I need you and Luca inside now . Marcy ? She may have turned off her com . - I 'll try and find them . - Yeah , I 'll look around ... - ... The neighborhood . - You stay put . - You 're just as wanted as Luca . - Hey . We 're right here . Hey . What 's wrong ? The FBI caught you on CCTV , knows who you are , and are searching the area . Yeah , if only we had somebody on the inside . There is no way I 'm risking my team getting discovered . I want you out of here . The mission comes first . You said it was a simple hand-off of a component , so hand it off , and get out of state . You know , there 's a simple answer to this problem . He needs to go . - Who needs to go ? - Go where ? Forbes ! He knows too much . He 's too close . We remove him , we don 't got to go anywhere . We are not killing Forbes . Well , if you can 't to do it , I know people who can , but it 's obvious to me the Director 's put us together for a reason ... so I can teach you a lesson . Now , if it 's too much for you to handle , I can help you , but I think it would be better for all of us to see if you have it in you . So ... Do we ... Do we have a problem ? No . Do you deny my seniority ? I don 't deny it . Of course not . You 're the kind of man who follows the rules . This is great , right ? Luca and I can handle our drop-off tonight while you deal with Forbes . I 'm gonna take your vehicle . - I 'll rent you a car . - Whatever . As long as you remember to bring it back with a full tank of gas . Cracks me up . I love this guy . Here 's the thing . When we 're both done , we are gonna have a conversation about how this new team will work together . Forbes . Hey , it 's Mac . You got something ? Yeah , maybe . We should meet . I 'll text you the location and the broad strokes , but we should go over the details in person . Say an hour ? Yeah , I can do that . You all right ? Never better . See you in an hour . We 're all set . Nobody said this was gonna be easy . I know , but I never thought we 'd have to do something like this . Just think of how MacLaren feels . He 's the one who has to do it . He doesn 't have to do anything . The Director didn 't order it . How confident are you in the Intel ? This is the place . Your new doctor thinks she 's your sister . Yeah . She told me . I hope she 's right . Well you should get that thought out of your head right now . Your loyalty needs to be with me . You know you have it . I 'm not so sure of MacLaren . Oh , don 't worry about MacLaren . I know what kind of guy he is . He 'll fall in line . And if he doesn 't ? Then he 'll have to go . FBI ! Hands ! Show me your hands ! Son of a bitch . Get out . Sergeant Richard Hall , you have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law . You have the right to an attorney . If you cannot afford one ... Search the car . The aisles are clear . Sorry for the change in location . What happened to the other team ? They apparently had complications . We were instructed to take over . Here it is . It was damaged , but we did our best to repair it . As long as it works . Helios isn 't far away . Wasn 't anything in the car . No ? That 's cool . We got plenty on ' em to put them away . Just makes me wonder ... What were they doing out here ? How about I ask them in the morning ? That works for me . Great work , partner . You too . Hey , guys . I know it 's late , I just wanted to touch base about what we did tonight . The last thing I ever thought I 'd do is turn on a fellow traveler ... but I really don 't think we had any other choice . I guess we 'll find out soon enough if the Director agrees . Anyway ... I just wanted to say thanks for sticking by me . Get some rest . Can you stay ? I shouldn 't . Okay . Tell me we did the right thing . I believe we did . But I guess we 'll see . Yeah . We 'll see .

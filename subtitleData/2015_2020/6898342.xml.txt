 ( CAMERA CLICKS ) ( VOICES ON POLICE RADIO ) MAN : And it is all my fault . I am truly lucky in that sense too . As Penelope once said to me , in those final days , " You 're only as rich as you feel . " So ... Save me from this . Chiswick , please . - OK , love . - ( SHE GASPS ) Hammer time ! If I was you , Harry , I 'd fold while I still have some bus fare left . All in . Turn them over , big lad . Shame . I was hoping to take that shirt off your back . This game is over for you , Detective . MAN : He lost it all again ? People don 't gamble because they want to win . They gamble because , secretly , they want to lose but with you ... ( LAUGHS ) it 's not even a secret . That 's very poetic , Freddie . You should write it down . I don 't want someone like you to owe me this much money . Believe me , Freddie , we 're agreed on that . Shut up and listen , Harry ! Your debt is useless to me . I can 't sell it on . No one will touch you . So I 'm calling it in . - What ? - You have three days . You do realize that 's a completely insane request ? What 's going on , Freddie ? OK . Take this as a down payment . You must know some powerful people in your line of business . You should ask for a favor . He 's arrived then , eh ? The new DSI ? Yeah . I worked with him a long time ago . Interesting guy . Long night ? No , no . I turned in early . I was whacked . What 's Orwell got ? Body dragged out of the Thames . Young woman . No ID yet . You didn 't really have an early night at all , did you ? You don 't have an off button , do you , Suri ? I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep . Clears out the molecular garbage in our brains . Molecular garbage ? Jesus . What if I fall asleep and all the good stuffs taken away instead ? They 'd have to find it first . I am your superior , you know that ? Harry , why don 't you just stop gambling ? Look , I have patches for my addictions . They have patches for porn ? Why are you really here ? You 're making my girls nervous . I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau . Why has he called in my debt ? - Belshazzar was the king of Babylon . - Here we go . A man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends . Just like Freddie Lau ? One evening , he holds a fabulous feast for them all . But during the feast , Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall . - It predicts ... - Belshazzar 's own death . So , what , you 're saying that someone 's threatening to kill Freddie Lau ? Why else would Lau be planning to sell up and leave London ? Ah , come on , Kaleem . Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out . You 're not telling me something . Come on , leave now . I have to watch my girls like a hawk . Oh , did that um ... missing stripper of yours ever turn up ? - What was her name ? - Kayleigh Fenchurch . Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday . - Matched her description . - Well , I hope and pray it 's not her . I have so few quality girls left . Oh , um ... How long did Belshazzar last ? Till the end of the night . ( CLEARS THROAT ) The prosecution have painted the defendant as a jealous ex-husband , as a cruel man with a vicious temper . A ticking emotional time bomb just waiting to go off . I like paintings , but pretty as they are , they have absolutely no place in a court of law . ( SIGHS ) It 's been a very long trial , hasn 't it ? Let me give you the good news . This is the last speech you will hear on this case . I just want to focus on one word . Doubt . ( CHEERING ) BARRISTER : See you on Monday . I 'll catch up with you later . Harry ! You ... I ... Were we supposed to meet today ? - No , no . I was just passing . - Oh . Um ... You were very impressive in there . The faces on the cops said it all . Yeah , well , they 've been an absolute joke . Shit , sorry . They 're probably your friends . No . Anyway , uh ... So I can still have Daisy this weekend if that 's OK ? No , that 's great . But you could have called to tell me that , so why are you really here ? Well , I just wondered if you , you know , fancied a drink or a bite to eat tonight ? Um ... I ... I can 't . I 'm ... I 'm having dinner with someone . OK . Cool . Yeah . Have a good night . Happy anniversary , Harry , You too . What the hell are you doing here , Harry ? I 've come to win my money back off you . You 're deluded . Fortune favors the brave . If fortune favored you , you wouldn 't be drinking here alone . So why don 't you have a drink with me , Freddie ? Unburden yourself . Take your hands off me , Harry . Do you mind ? ( MAN SHOUTS ) Look at me ! I need your help . I need to talk to Freddie ! Look , Kayleigh 's gone , JC ! She 's disappeared ! She 's gone ! Listen to me . JC , look at me ! CROUPIER : Wheel spinning . No more bets , please . - ( BALL ROLLS ) - CROUPIER : Black as . All the way to hell . That 's a long way to go on a Monday night . CROUPIER : Wheel spinning . You should try the corners . No more bets . ( BALL ROLLS ) - CROUPIER : Red three . - ( LAUGHS ) May I ? Sure , yeah . I need all the luck I can get . Yeah , I can see that . You know , luck 's a revolving door . You just need to know when it 's your turn to walk through . CROUPIER : Wheel spinning . Is there a significant number for you tonight ? Play the whole lot . What have you got to lose ? Ten to the max . No more bets , please . Black ten . Jesus Christ ! ( LAUGHS ) Do it again , Detective Clayton . - What did you just say ? - The same number again . CROUPIER : Wheel spinning . Another ten to the maximum . No more bets , please . ( WOMAN LAUGHS LOUDLY ) ( LAUGHTER ) Let me help you . Where did it all go wrong ? I can 't believe what just happened . What if ... luck is something you can own ? What ? What ... VOICEMAIL : You have two new messages . First new message . SURI : Jesus Christ , where are you , Harry ? A body 's been found in Chinatown and we 're on call . VOICEMAIL : Message deleted . Next new message . SURI : Harry , call me back . VOICEMAIL : Message deleted . End of messages . ( TIRES SCREECH ) Excuse me . Suri . ( SIGHS ) DI Orwell 's here . Why ? Our new chief called him in when you didn 't answer any of my calls . That 's grand . Listen , Harry . I deleted your text from his phone before Orwell got here . - What ? - Harry ! You look like shit . What were you up to last night ? Getting lucky . We think this is Freddie Lau . Owner of the London Green Dragon Casino . DI Clayton knows who he is . Come on , Ben , let 's give Harry some room , shall we ? - Do you want some notes , Chohan ? - Sure . I need a laugh . - HARRY : Strangled ? - Yeah . Lau 's PIN was one-two-three-four . Why are you texting a dead man , Harry ? This is not going to affect our investigation . - No . That 's not good enough . - You have to trust me on this , Suri . Jesus , Harry , we can 't investigate a murder if you 're considered a suspect . You know I 'm not a suspect . No cameras . It 's the perfect spot . See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau , his daughter and heir . ( WHISTLES ) Harry , wait . I need more . I just crossed a pretty scary line for you . You owe me a proper explanation . I owed Freddie Lau money . Gambling debts from his casino . But this has got nothing to do with me . I don 't care how you get your kicks , Harry . But if I 'm going to have your back , I need to know it 's coming from the right place . ( BUZZER ) It 's Harry . ( BUZZER ) - Hello , Josie , is he in ? - Mmm . Harry 's here . JOSIE : Napoleonic . Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia . Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night . Half-brother . Is this official or unofficial ? You better come in . 70 grand . I need you to um ... look after it for a while . Who does it belong to , Harry ? - It was in transition . - From you to ... A man who died this morning . I won it last night at his casino . You owed him this much money ? - Double it . - Harry ! - Don 't start with me . - You need to get a grip on this . How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side ? Hmm ? - Thank you , Rich . - Pleasure . Here . Look , um ... There 's something else . What ? Will you have a look at this ? ( LAUGHS ) I didn 't take you as the bangle type , Harry , but then jewelry creeps up on the best of us . - Where did you get this ? - It 's hard to explain . A woman ? - You dark horse ! Take it off . - I can 't . - Well , let me try . - I 've tried . It won 't come off . Well , how did you get it on in the first place ? - I haven 't a baldy . - Wow , that must have been some night . Right ... - I have no idea what this is . - Really ? Or where it comes from or how old it is . Which really is quite bloody strange . But I 'll take a shaving and test it later . Come here . I 'm glad you 're uh ... moving on from Anna . It 's about time . Whoa , whoa . That 's not what 's happening . I still love her . But does she still love you ? Course she bloody does . OK . Look , I 'm just saying . Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won 't work anymore . Right , Confucius . MAN : I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation . It 's no secret that in this department , in this police force , there have been sins committed . And that 's why I 'm here . And why my predecessor 's enjoying an early retirement . - Now I 'm sure I come with a ... - ( DOOR OPENS ) With a certain reputation . But I like to think I 'm fighting on the side of the angels . It 's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I 'm doing it . I want London to be proud of its police force . And I 'll do anything to help make that happen . ( DOOR OPENS ) This is Kayleigh Fenchurch . Former dancer at the Pleasure Palace . Yeah , I know who she is , Doug . Why 's she next to my victim , Freddie Lau ? Because she was strangled too . However , unlike Freddie Lau , Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now . Impossible to recover any of the killer 's DNA from her body . Freddie Lau 's casino is less than a mile from Pleasure Palace where Fenchurch worked . You think we 're looking for the same killer ? I 'm just pointing out similarities in their deaths . Strangling is not a common MO . HARRY : Such a clumsy way to kill someone . What ? You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes . You really have to hate them or love them . HARRY : Who 's that ? Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov . Jumped off his penthouse balcony . Not much left of him . It 's going to take at least another 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau 's body processed . SURI : Harry ? Kaleem intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed . - Kaleem , owner of the Pleasure Palace ? - Yeah . Kayleigh Fenchurch 's boss . He hinted that someone new was trying to muscle out Freddie - but Freddie wasn 't listening . - Maybe the two murders are connected . Yeah , but Kayleigh Fenchurch 's murder was so precise . You know , no DNA , they drop her in the Thames . Freddie Lau , his body 's just dumped in an alleyway . Sloppy Check out the CCTV in Soho on the night Freddie died . Might be able to pick up his movements . I 've got a croupier to find . ( PANTING ) You 're a hard man to track down , JC . I need your help with something . Get lost , Harry , this is my downtime . ( yells ) What the hell are you doing ? Did I not tell you ? I 'm your new personal trainer . - Please ! - Ah-ah ! The tall guy the other night in the casino . The one that got chucked out . What 's his name ? - You can 't do this , Harry . - This is just the warm-up . What 's his name ? The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau ? Alright . Alright . Stop . His name 's Kevin Grey . He used to be on the staff . He got chucked off a couple of months ago . - Why ? - I don 't know . It 's OK , I 've got my badges . Why ? Look , all 's I know is that ... is that there was a girl between them . Some stripper who worked in Soho . Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental . - Kayleigh Fenchurch ? - Jesus , Harry , stop the machine ! - I 'm dying here , come on ! - Come on , one last push , JC . He was wearing a barman 's outfit when he came in , wasn 't he ? Try Kinzoku in Chinatown . ( GROANS ) ( PANTS ) Cuff-Fit . All the rage in LA . Need to see Lily-Anne . - It 's not gonna happen , Grey . - Why ? What do you mean , why ? You 're the prime suspect in her father 's murder . I need her help to get me out of here . Time is running out for me . Like it was running out for poor Freddie . Either she helps me get out of here or they 're gonna catch me and I will not keep my mouth shut ! Alright ? - There you are . - Thank you , Stan . Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku . Lily-Anne Lau 's karaoke bar ? SURI : Who 's that ? No one . Come on , let 's go in . ( MUSIC PLAYS ) # It was a kind of so-so love # And I 'm gonna make sure it never happens again it You and I , it had to be I ? The standing joke of the year ... - Whoo ! - Is this a wake ? No . He needs to be in the ground for it to be a wake . This is a celebration . - Do you see Kevin Grey ? - No . But I 've seen enough . - Whoo ! - Let 's bring her in for questioning . Long time , Harry . Yes , it is , sir . I hear you 're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder . You don 't mind if I watch as you interview them ? No , I don 't suppose I will . I never expected to find you still here , Harry . Forgive me if I 'm a little bit confused here but when we ran into you last night , you were having quite a party . The Chinese attitude to grief is very ... different . Death is pan of the wheel of rebirth . Away to enlightenment . So singing ' 80s classics is your expression of grief ? LAWYER : Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will to help with your inquiry ? You 're absolutely right and we 're very grateful . So , Miss Lau , being so close to your father , you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey . You do know Kevin Grey , don 't you ? Course I do . He used to work for my father and now he works for me . But I 'm not aware of any dispute between them . In fact , it was my father who recommended Grey to me . We were told they had fallen out over a stripper called Kayleigh Fenchurch . What ? Her body was found the day before your dad died . We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad . Detective Clayton , I like to think you knew my father very well . He had a girl in every bar in town . It was hard for me to keep track . ls there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey ? - Not that I can think of . - Miss Lau has answered your questions . - I 'd like to draw this to a close . - You 're right , Miss Lau . I did know your father and you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him ? Fear . - Fear ? - He knew , didn 't he ? He knew he was going to be killed . - I don 't know what you mean . - I think you do . Freddie wasn 't the son of man that scares easily but someone had him on the run . - If you say so , Harry . - Yet you ... You seem completely unaffected through all of this . Cool as a cucumber . Why is that ? I don 't like the direction you 're taking . Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched . - If you 're not charging my client ... - What did they promise you , Lily-Anne ? You 're playing a very dangerous game here , Harry . The truth is , you 're in no position to be questioning me about any of this . And why is that ? ( ELECTRICAL CRACKLING ) Sir ? What 's the matter with it ? My father died very soon after he called in your debt , Harry Clayton . And you were there , in the casino , the night it happened . SURI : So what happened ? BEN : There was a shod and the screen jumped . - SURI : I can 't believe that . - Suri . Wait . Suri ... - It cut out . - What cut out ? There was a shod . Ben just told me . Everything went down . ( SIGHS ) Why weren 't you honest with me , Harry ? - I looked like an idiot in there . - I 'm sorry . How am I supposed to do my job knowing you were at that casino the night Lau died ? - Yeah , I should have told you that . - And yet once again , you didn 't . You 're the reason I got to where I am , Harry . Everything I 've learnt has come from watching you these two years , but that doesn 't mean I 'm going to let you screw it up for me . Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn 't be quite sure who was interviewing who . You have to think the way they do . Should be quite easy for you . You 'd be a smartarse if you were smart ( LAUGHS ) ORWELL : Trouble in the dream team ? ( BANG ) I should never have bought it for her . It 's too big . The bike was fine . She loved it . Come on ! ANNA : Sit down , Harry . You look thin . That 's a good thing , eh ? No , thin like you 're not eating properly . Oh . Yeah , I don 't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you . - Are we going to do this now ? - Good night for a date . - Our tenth anniversary . - How do you know it was a date ? I just wanted to see you . I haven 't asked you anything about whether or not you 're seeing anyone else and I 'm not going to , Harry , cos I just can 't . He 's a friend . - Oh ... - And a divorce lawyer . - What ? - I 'm worried , Harry . I don 't want to lose anything else after the house . So that 's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner ? That 's very convenient for him , eh ? - You 're still gambling , aren 't you ? - What ? Aren 't you ? I 'm trying , Anna . Do something about it , Harry . For all of us . WOMAN : Mr and Mrs Clayton ? OK ? WOMAN : Mr Clayton ? There 's someone to see you . I 'm sorry about your daughter . Is she OK ? Yes . How did you know ? How long have you been following me ? Awhile . I haven 't got much time to explain . - It 's not safe for me here . - What ? - Or you . - What are you talking about ? I was meant to give it to someone else , and he knows you have it , Harry . - You 're talking about the bracelet ? - I know you 're a good man , which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he 'll come after you . - Who 'll come after me ? - The man it was promised to . What is this ? Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck . - Well , that 's shite . - ( WOMAN LAUGHS ) You 're already starting to feel it , though , aren 't you ? No . Wait , wait , wait . Don 't go . It 's a balance , Harry . It 's yin and yang . Luck like this has its own unique price .

Great . I have something to show you . HARRY : Where is this ? - The Falkner 's Arms , opposite ... - The Green Dragon . The night Lau died . I 'm guessing five minutes before he died . - HARRY : What ? - Keep watching . Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau . Come on . You have nothing here . Sol had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening . So what ? This is accessory to murder . No . Harry , I need something here , Harry . Old friend . You 've been lying all along about this . I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau . Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge . Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau . A nice neat love triangle . Case closed . But that 's not what 's really happening here , is it , Kaleem ? So tell me who 's pulling at your strings . I don 't know . You 're going to Whitecross . Give me those . No , no . Please . Please . Please . I know where he 's going to be . Who ? Kevin Grey . If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway , in theory he can just walk onto a plane . - What 's the flight schedule tonight ? - I 'll get on it . Don 't let me keep you , DS Chohan . How 's Anna ? She 's good . Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey . She was on terrific form . Tore the case apart Told me she 'd finally left you . We 're working things out . She may be , but not you , Harry . I want DI Orwell kept up to date on everything to do with the Lau case . You 're gonna both be running it from now on . OK ? Mm-hm . No sign of Grey 's boat . Clear line of sight to the harbor entrance . How many flights are left after this one ? Two . Athens and Paris . The first two cities to host the Olympics . Where does your freakish general knowledge come from ? My dad used to sell encyclopedias until the internet came along . Harry . Speedboat approaching from the harbor entrance , over . Copy that . Why did you let one of DI Orwell 's stooges in on this ? I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together ? We 're still working it out . He 's a good cop apparently . Just a shame Orwell got him . How do you ever know ? - Know what ? - That someone 's right for you ? Jesus , I don 't know why you 're asking me . I uh ... suppose you just do . But when you do , make sure you hold on to them . - We 're on , over . - HARRY : Copy that . Alright , mate . Wait till he 's past the jetty then hit him with the light when we 're nearly on him . What 's he doing ? Oh , Jesus . Police ! Stop ! Kevin Grey , on your knees now ! Ben ! Grey ! Put your weapon down ! You 're surrounded . They sold me out ! ( YELLS ) Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - Are you OK ? - Yeah . - Ben , are you hit ? - No , I 'm fine . Follow us in the car . He 's going east . Get support - Get in . - Do you know what you 're doing , Harry ? Hold on tight . Feed 's up , sir . God . Don 't let Clayton be driving . ( GUNSHOT ) - BEN : Harry , stay back ! - ( GUNSHOT ) ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - Get down ! BEN : Slow down ! - Shit .

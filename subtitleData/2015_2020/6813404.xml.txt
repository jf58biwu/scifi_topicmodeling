 THE WORLD IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SIDES : ONE ABUNDANT , THE OTHER SCARCE . A SELECTION PROCESS LIES BETWEEN THEM . AT THE AGE OF 20 , EACH PERSON HAS ONE CHANCE . THE CHOSEN ONES NEVER RETURN . THEY ARE THE 3 % . YEAR 104 OF THE PROCESS [ crowd chattering outside ] [ sharp whistle ] [ woman in earpiece ] Good morning , Michele . The gates to the Selection Process are open . The estimated time of your walk is : 47 minutes . [ overlapping chatter ] Go , honey . I slept for maybe two hours . I was too anxious . I doubt anyone slept last night . Take care , okay ? THE CAUSE EVERYONE IS WORTHY [ man ] " Envy and resentment have led to the rise of groups ... " Don 't dwell on that . My dear Nair , you can say that because you are 4,000 miles away in the safety of the Offshore . These terrorists are right at our doorstep . - [ no audible dialogue ] - [ woman cackles ] Are you going to pass ? Look at her ! You know ... You know I almost made it ? I lasted three days ! [ chuckles ] Good luck to you ! [ laughs ] You 're screwed ! You won 't last a day in there ! [ sobs ] This is as far as you can come , okay ? Now you go home , okay ? SUBEQUATORIAL AMAZON [ group ] With the faith of the Founding Couple ! With the commitment of the Founding Couple ! With the strength of the Founding Couple ! Amen ! [ air whooshing ] [ people chattering ] What should I do with these ? [ woman over PA ] Please do not forget your box numbers . Numbers ? Fuck the numbers ! I 'm never wearing these rags again . [ indistinct chatter ] [ crowd goes quiet ] Three percent . Only three percent of you will form the select group of heroes heading to the Offshore ... where the Founding Couple created the perfect world . Where there is no injustice . Everyone gets the same chance , and then , the place they deserve ... SUPERIOR COUNCIL OFFSHORE the Offshore or Inland . Or as some may say , " their side " or " our side . " This Process ensures that only the best of us will enjoy life on the Offshore . But not everyone understands this . As you know , envy and resentment have fueled groups , who in the name of a false and hypocritical equality and with populist ideas , aim to destroy everything we have achieved . But they have always failed and will continue to fail . And so , welcome , everyone . Welcome , Michele . I hope that you will do your very best , Joana . And that you will trust the Process , Alex . Because all these years of sacrifice , Fernando , could be rewarded right here . Remember , you each create your own merit . No matter what happens ... you deserve this . Now would be a good time to express our gratitude , don 't you think ? Repeat after me : We are grateful for the chance ... [ candidates ] We are grateful for the chance ... - for a better way of life . - For a better way of life . Thank you very much . [ candidates ] Thank you very much . A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [ theme music playing ] CHAPTER 01 CUBES [ woman ] Candidates , please proceed to the interview rooms . Thank you . - Need some help ? I can push you . - No , I 'm good , thanks . - It 's all good , I can help ... - Buddy , I said I don 't need it . Let them see I can get around by myself . Sorry , man . I didn 't mean to get in your way . There 's a lot of people . At this rate , by the time we get to the Offshore , we 'll all be 30 or 40 . [ chuckles ] [ woman ] Congratulations on your speech . You don 't work here . My name is Aline . I was sent to evaluate the Process this year . I don 't think I got that memo . It was a last-minute decision . It 's a routine analysis of the tests and changes made over the past few years . So , I am your memo . [ both chuckle ] Okay . But first I need to confirm your identity , all right ? Of course . If you didn 't , that would have to go in my report . Okay . It 'll be a pleasure having you around . Why didn 't you warn me someone was coming to evaluate me ? You were so focused on your speech , I didn 't want to distract you . Besides , you and I have more important issues to discuss , Ezequiel . This year 's Process is very important . No more important than any other year . - Nothing 's changed . - [ chuckling ] Of course it has , Ezequiel . - How ? - Are you blind ? For the first time in a hundred years , someone was murdered here , on our side . - Tell me what that has ... - Don 't start again . Nair , please tell me what this has to do with me and with my Process . You 're the Process Leader , responsible for everyone who comes to the Offshore . He proved to be perfectly suitable while he was here ... I 'm not the one you need to convince . I 'm just warning you , there are those who want to blame you for the first homicide in our history . It 's given Councilor Matheus and his followers leverage . Matheus , of course . He wants his people to take over the Process . He wants a lighter Process , a weaker Process . To do things his way . This is my Process . Only I can lead it . Look , I have enough to worry about at the moment , Nair . I 'm sorry . [ water stops ] [ gasps ] - Hi , how are you ? My name is ... - Alex . [ exhales ] Before we begin , are you aware we have no inclusion policies for ... Yes , I am . You believe you can make it through the Process ? Absolutely . I 'm going to ask a sensitive question . When was the last time you washed your hair ? Since the last time I had enough water to waste . Can we go out sometime ? I 'd like to get to know you better outside of these walls . If all A 's are B 's , but not all B 's are C 's , is it possible to have an A that 's also a C ? Five seconds , okay ? [ no audible dialogue ] I feel like I am one of ... I 'm sure that I 'm one of the best ... Listen , Carolina ... take a breath . I 'll give you another chance to pull yourself together . [ stammers ] I am ... I 'm sure I 'm one of the three percent of ... of people ... Elimination reason number two . What ? Eliminated now ? I didn 't know I could be eliminated now ... Carolina , look at yourself . If you don 't believe you 're worthy of passing , how can I ? [ sobbing ] And what is your biggest weakness ? Um ... I care too much about people ? [ laughing ] Just kidding . But that 's a good answer , right ? It 's a place where each of us can grow and reach our full potential . - But it 's also about helping others and ... - Enough . You answered the question . May I just add another point ? I wanted to say it 's about thinking of the community and ... Have you seen this before ? It 's graffitied everywhere . And how do you feel about the ideas of the Cause ? They 're just a bunch of losers who couldn 't pass and now they want to ruin everything . Do you know anyone who made it through ? - Luis , my boyfriend . - [ man shouts ] Let go of me ! He wasn 't understanding me ! I need to go back ! - Last year ? - Yes . So you want to pass to be cured ? I have other ambitions and goals as well as that one . So , you want to pass to see him again . - A romantic reunion ? - No . - No ? - No . He give you that necklace ? If you 're not a romantic , why do you wear it ? - [ stammers ] It 's a souvenir . - A souvenir ! [ laughs ] Did your father raise you to have faith in the Process ? Yes . He 's a pastor . You are one of the worst candidates I 've ever interviewed . Maybe you 're just the worst interviewer there is . Who do you think you are ? Don 't you realize we have candidates begging to not be eliminated ? I doubt the Offshore is interested in beggars . [ panting ] - But why ? - Enough . You 're eliminated . You 're losing one of the best candidates . You talked for 20 minutes without saying anything original . - Please ... - Memorized bullshit . Please , one more chance . I 've dreamed of this my entire life . I swear I 'll shut up . Is that it ? Is it because I talk too much ? I won 't say another word , I swear ! I 've been waiting for this my whole life . Don 't eliminate me ! Instructions on how to overcome the trauma of elimination will be given to you while you return your uniform . - Please ! - Please , leave . - Please ! - Another candidate needs this seat . No ! This is my seat ! My seat ! Let me go ! I 'm not leaving ! This is my dream ! I have to get to the Offshore ! Let me go ! Please ! I swear , I swear , I 'm good ! You are losing the best candidate ! I am the best ! I am ! [ shouting continues , fading ] How do you picture the Offshore ? I imagine ... I 'll be happy . - Mm . - I 'll be with my family . Relaxed . Safe . Fulfilled . Now , how do I picture it ? If it 's full of trees , - cars that can fly , I really don 't know . - Mm-hm . But I know I 'm going to be surprised . And don 't you feel bad , Fernando ? For being a burden on your father ? I 'm not a burden . It 's the opposite . He believes in me , in my abilities . How touching . Tell me something . How do you know he actually made it ? He made it . Sometimes , candidates don 't return due to unforeseen circumstances . Unfortunate accidents . You look very calm . There 's nothing to be afraid of . My family has done well in the Process . I have uncles , cousins ... my parents . Do you really believe that gives you an advantage ? I am here to judge you , not your family history . I know . That 's not what I meant . - Do you think your father loves you ? - [ Fernando ] Yes . - Do you love him ? - Of course I do . So , tell me three things about him . He ... He ... I don 't know off the top of my head . Tell me something you admire him for , something you 've learned from him . He ... He ... You told me that you love him . You want to pass because your father 's been telling you to pass - since you were a kid . - No , I want to pass to end my pain so he doesn 't waste all his time on me . Look , if you keep saying the same thing , I 'll eliminate you right now . Why do you really want to pass ? So I won 't have a life like his . APPROVED - What 's his name again ? - Luis . Luis Ferreira . Let 's find out if he really made it through . Do you really want to know ? No . No , I don 't care . That 's not why I want to pass . So , I guess that necklace doesn 't mean anything , huh ? If you take too long , I 'll question your honesty and eliminate you . Are you gonna cry ? You can move on to the next round . APPROVED You did the right thing . He 's dead . [ gunfire and shouting on screen ] [ Ezequiel ] Cássia , what about the son of a bitch that was caught ? [ Cássia ] It 's confirmed . He 's with the Cause . Going by the name Jorge . Caught him alive , no collateral damage . - Is that him ? - Yes . - Has the interrogation started ? - Yes . He told us one of this year 's candidates is a mole for the Cause . He hasn 't given us a name yet , but it 's just a matter of time . If there is a mole among them , I need to know as soon as possible . They captured Jorge alive . Those pigs are one step ahead of us . The question is , with Jorge now in their hands , what can he reveal about the moles ? - Does he know names ? - [ man ] No . He knew I had sent someone . He didn 't have a name . Maybe a few details . - Why did he know details at all ? - [ woman ] Calm down . [ man ] This puts the whole operation at risk . Calm down . We have to find out what he knew . I know how to run my team . And I know Jorge . He 's devoted to the Cause . He would never betray us ! Take it easy . It 's not about betrayal . No one can withstand their torture . We have to assume that whatever he knows , the Process now knows . [ soft gasps ] [ Ezequiel in earpiece ] Hey , Cássia . Any news ? He 's still resisting . He hasn 't revealed the name of the mole , but it 's just a matter of time . He 's softening up . [ soft , rasping breath ] [ woman ] This is bullshit ! It 's all bullshit ! Motherfuckers , there are much worse candidates than me ! [ crying ] I feel bad for them . [ man ] Eliminated candidates , this way . - Eliminated ? That way . - Hold on ... Yeah , but ... there 's nothing we can do . It might be fair , but it 's still sad . - [ body thuds ] - [ group gasps ] Stand back ! Get back ! [ Ezequiel ] Dr. Gisele will take care of the candidate . Right now we need everyone to remain calm . If you need anything , need to talk , counseling , we are here to help you . [ Ezequiel ] Don 't let this interfere with the most important day of your lives . Keep going with your tests . The Process continues this way . Follow me . Okay . Let 's go . It 's hard , but we have to move on . [ woman over PA ] Candidates , please report to the registry scanner . Naughty boy . Aren 't you ashamed ? - What ? - Your fake registration . When they do it , they only use three stitches . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Let 's see what the scanner says . [ scanner whirring ] [ affirmative beep ] WELCOME [ scanner whirring ] [ affirmative beep ] [ scanner whirring ] [ negative beep ] [ scanner whirring ] [ affirmative beep ] This next test is very simple . It evaluates your spatial logic , geometric reasoning and basic motor skills . Using these pieces , each of you will have three minutes to assemble as many cubes as possible . We expect a minimum of nine cubes . Any less and you will be eliminated . And when the table turns red , it means your time is up . One , two , three , begin . Thanks . What 's her deal ? Trying to be politically correct ? Doesn 't she know it 's every man for himself ? Damn it ! I 've asked them to fix this crap a thousand times . There we go . [ three beeps ] [ two beeps ] [ countdown alert beeping ] That 's my cube ! What the fuck ? Time 's up ! Whoever has nine cubes passes . Didn 't you see him steal my cube ? Time 's up . Eight cubes . Sorry , you 're eliminated . - Thanks for participating . - Motherfucker ! - Let me go ! Let me go ! - Take him . No ! Let me go ! Ezequiel , that kid stole the cube . [ chuckles ] Nine , you passed . Sorry , you 've been eliminated . Only eight cubes . Eliminated . Eliminated . [ sighs ] Nine cubes ? You passed . Eight plus a cube made of cubes . Nine . You passed as well . Eliminated . [ sighs , counts softly ] Nine . Eleven ? [ chuckles ] [ exhales ] Excuse me . You have to understand , while each test has an obvious goal , what 's really important is what 's behind them . But you may not get that yet . I 'm not here to judge , Ezequiel . I 'm just recording the facts . [ Ezequiel mutters ] She will never understand , Ezequiel . [ candidates chattering ] - [ woman ] Mm . Delicious . - [ Marco ] It 's too sweet . So , you ... I heard ... I heard some of the girls talking . They said you 're an Álvares . - Your family always passes . - Yeah . So ? What 's the secret ? - Congeniality , of course . - [ chuckles ] I want to thank you , really . What you did ... Forget it . It was nothing . [ man ] Look who 's here . [ whispers ] That 's him . [ candidates murmuring ] [ woman ] Is that him ? That 's so messed up . I don 't understand how the Process let him pass . I don 't get the criteria . [ man murmurs ] Look at him ... Cheater . Go on . Keep talking about me . Go ahead . I don 't care . I 'm impressed how everyone here is so honest , so fair . I just don 't understand why none of you did anything . Why didn 't anyone try to stop me or help the other guy ? The ones in the room . Hm ? Why didn 't you do anything ? Do you know why ? Do you ? Anyone ? I know . Because everyone is here to make it through . Everyone . And everyone will do whatever it takes to pass . I only did what everyone here will do sooner or later . That 's all . And most importantly : If you keep thinking you 're better than me ... then you 'll lose . And you 'll lose to me . And you 'll lose to everyone here who really gets what 's at stake . For real . What about you , big guy ? What do you say ? - Why don 't you shut up ? - No , I want your opinion . Are you saying you 'd just keep your head down and accept elimination without a word ? Would you do that ? Would you be that stupid ? Take your hands off me , cheater . [ man shouts ] Take that , you son of a bitch ! Say something now , motherfucker ! Come on , loser ! - [ crowd clamoring ] - Come on ! - Cheater ! - Come on ! Come on ! [ man shouts ] Cheater ! That 's enough ! Stop ! Leave the guy alone ! Let him go . Let 's go . You don 't fool me . I know you got beat up on purpose . It worked . Now you have a bunch of idiots on your side . Actually , having a friend in the Process isn 't such a bad idea . [ chuckles ] Me ? Why me ? Because if you betray me ... I 'll tell them your registration is fake . I know you 're very busy , but if I wait until you have free time , we 'll never get a chance to talk . I 'm waiting for someone , but in the meantime , go ahead . Tell me , how would you evaluate your performance over the last five years ? My productivity rates have reached record levels . What about adaptation ? Community well-being ? Your candidates haven 't done well in that area . They didn 't score well when compared to productivity rates . Which , once again , have reached record levels . Are you familiar with the concept in which selected candidates adopt the personality of the Process Leader ? [ chuckles ] Sounds like the typical psychobabble of Councilor Matheus . - Have you met ? - [ sighs ] How have you been feeling ? I 'm great . What a question . Why do you ask ? I 'm just wondering if you ever think about your wife . - What ? - Julia . I never met her , but I heard what happened . And even from afar , it sounded painful . Even ... - I 'm sorry . I 'll come back later . - [ Ezequiel ] Come in . Aline was on her way out . Actually , I would love to sit in on your meeting , if you don 't mind . [ Ezequiel ] Please . I was waiting for you . I called you here to talk about the candidate who committed suicide . [ sighs ] Uh ... I did his interview , his evaluation , and he definitely showed no ... Denise , I 'm not questioning your judgment . On the contrary , I 'm worried about you . I 'm fine . Agent Denise , sadly , suicide is not uncommon among candidates . They do it out of shame . Because they are weak . - It 's pathetic . - Pathetic . But it takes a toll . And there 's no shame in admitting that . We can 't ignore our feelings ... or we 'll never find happiness . Of course , the suicide of a young man with no merits is a tragedy . But you ... you 're a person of merit . That 's why it 's always good ... [ Aline ] Ezequiel ! Ezequiel ! Stop , Ezequiel ! Stop , Ezequiel ! Ezequiel ! [ gasps ] [ coughing ] [ panting ] I do that every day to remind myself that what we do is a matter of life and death . I understand . Perfectly . Do you see things more clearly ? [ door closes ] [ door opens ] Ezequiel , I would like to thank you . Everything I 've learned here in such a short time is beyond anything I would 've learned somewhere else . Thank you . [ Cássia ] Ezequiel ? Ezequiel , we have a lead . [ Ezequiel ] I want the infiltrator 's name . It 's one of two candidates . Michele ? Bruna ? Come with me , please . Thank you , Bernardo . This way . - What 's that ? - Close your eyes . Here . Duck your head . - [ Michele ] I don 't know what 's happening . - [ Bruna ] Me neither . [ Michele ] Look , I know what this is about . You heard me complaining about the guy who cheated in the test . I won 't criticize the Process anymore . I 've learned my lesson . Have you two met before ? - Yes , we ... - We ... - We live on the same block . - Where do you live ? I live on 7th Street , block 35 , apartment 42 . Same block , apartment 12 . We received some information that a mole working for the Cause lives on that same street , on the same block . How do you know that ? The fact is , we know that one of you sitting here is the mole . I just don 't know which one . So , I have three minutes to find out who is with the Cause and who is innocent . And if I can 't figure it out , the recommended step is that I kill both of you . - Ma 'am ... - There must be a mistake . I don 't know anyone in the Cause . - Me neither . - We know each other . I swear to you ... Sit down ! Stay back , please . - This is a test . - No , unfortunately , it 's not . [ Michele ] I 'm innocent ! I 'm ... I am not with the Cause ! - I don 't know anyone in the Cause ! - Me neither . - [ Michele ] I am not with the Cause . - Neither am I. - Are you accusing me ? - Of course not ! But she said it 's one of us and I 'm saying it 's not me . - It 's not me , either ! - Bruna , you know me . - You know I 'm not with the Cause ! - I can 't sit here listening to excuses . I need a confession , do you understand ? - Bruna , please ... - [ softly ] It 's not me . Whoever is with the Cause and believes that they 're a savior ... this is your chance to do something useful for society and save someone 's life . Because you will die anyway and take an innocent person with you . [ Bruna sighs ] [ Ezequiel ] Cássia ! Bruna , please ... if you are with the Cause , save my life . I 'm not with the Cause , Michele . - I 'm not . - Then they have the wrong information . Of course they do ! What are we going to do , for God 's sake ? - This isn 't happening ... - We 're gonna die . We 're already dead . [ Bruna ] What are we gonna do ? Listen . [ whispering ] We have one way out . We have to attack this woman . - We have to attack her . Shh . - We can 't attack her . She 's armed . - If we get her gun , she 'll ... - [ softly ] She won 't . It 's you and me . - Two against one . - Mm-hm . Bruna , when she comes back , we 'll take her gun . We 're gonna run away from the Process . We 're gonna run away . Bruna , we can 't die now . I don 't wanna die . Look at me . Trust me , okay ? I 'll give you a signal and we 'll attack her . [ footsteps approaching ] Your time is up . Who 's going to confess ? [ man ] Why do you want to make it through ? I have a lot to offer the Offshore . If I have enough merit , you will see it in me . [ man ] Your boyfriend gave you this . What boyfriend ? I don 't have a boyfriend . [ chuckles ] I know . It 's for the interviewer . You have to say exactly what the Process wants to hear . [ yelling ] [ gunshot ] It was Ezequiel . - Ezequiel killed my brother . - Don 't think about that . You won 't get anywhere near Ezequiel . And if you do , run . Stay away from him . I 'm sorry you had to see that . Move aside . Cássia ? Cássia ? Get up . Get over there . I think I can trust you . I got this . That 's what my brother used to say . Whenever I asked him for anything , he 'd say , " I got this . " You really loved him . He was five years older than me and ... when our parents died ... Revenge isn 't about killing Ezequiel . It 's destroying their entire world . [ man 's words echo ] You have to act as if you blindly believe in the Process . Act completely naive . Tell me ... can you cry ? Yes . That will be useful . Are you gonna cry ? [ man ] The key is to hold back your tears . Fight them back . That 's what gets to them . I got this . [ Cássia ] Michele , what just happened has to stay between us . A mole for the Cause is not the concern of the other candidates . [ candidates chattering ] [ wailing ] [ muffled sobs ] Where were you ? Michele , what happened ?

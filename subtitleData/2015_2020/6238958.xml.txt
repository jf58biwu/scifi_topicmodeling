 Barbie : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , Forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... Grief ... Fear . My god . ( people exclaiming ) Now , in order to survive , We must battle our most dangerous adversary ... The enemy within . I 'm christine price . This is my friend , eva . Julia : You were together for what felt like a year . So i understand if you still have feelings . You can 't possibly understand any of this . You never went anywhere . I did . I moved on . I got rid of you . You should be thanking me . Yesterday we were together . But in the matrix , You moved on without me . Christine : According to the dark flight Calculations of the meteoroid ... ( quietly ) : Therapist , my ass . ( indistinct radio chatter ) I 'm getting out of here . You 're leaving town ? Those people , they 're not the same . They 've changed . I 'm right about them . Just like i was right about everything else . ¶ ¶ ( quietly ) : What the hell is that ? What is she ? ( bird chirping ) What a surprise to see you here . Is this your campsite ? Took your advice- - dropped the match . No more house , no more big jim . ( panting ) Oh . I just get so sweaty when i run . Do you have a clean shirt i could borrow ? Yeah . ( whispers ) : What ? How does that make you feel ? I feel like my dad 's gonna come after me . Ah . Well , letting go Of the past and moving on ... Is a process . You 've taken an important first step . Hey , what are you doing today ? I was gonna head into town . Perfect . I could use your help with a project . Well ... I 'll see you soon . Big jim : Well , normally , I 'd applaud you , kid , but ... That woman ... That thing . Wait ! ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( door opens ) ( relieved sigh ) Are you okay ? You said you 'd be back in an hour . I didn 't sleep all night , worrying . Yeah . I , uh ... Was just out wandering . After i buried melanie and dad , I needed some more time . Sorry . I understand . What 's this ? Julia : Oh , it 's an i.D. Badge . I found it in the biggest cocoon , where melanie put the egg . I 'm guessing whoever was inside must be important . Yeah . Makes sense . I think we should talk to christine . I think she knows more than she 's telling us . Well , christine saved your life . She killed melanie to do it . And i 'm grateful . But how did she show up at the perfect time ? She said she was out hunting . Where are you going ? Into town . Why ? Because i think we should . Barbie ... Wait . What the hell ? Where 's the camera ? Where 's the camera ? Christine : It 's amazing how quickly they 've begun to gather . Last night they heard my call ; today ... More have set up camp . One by one , they 're completing their journeys . James is farthest along . He 's let go of the fear that held him back . Today i 'll assess his progress and see if he 's ready To take the next step . Sam is also doing very well , Putting his shame behind him . And norrie has let go of most of her anger . But i 'm concerned about joe- - he didn 't show up last night . Perhaps his grief has resurfaced . His resistance could be contagious If it 's not snuffed out . I 'll pay him a visit . Well , i 'm surprised to see barbie with julia . He and eva seemed so bonded last night . The moment he 's ready to move on ... There won 't be any reason for her to exist . ( birds chirping ) Come on . Your turn . There 's no way i 'm stripping down and getting in there . ( laughs ) : You said if i did , you would . Yeah , and you fell for it . ( squeals ) ( both laugh ) I can 't believe we stayed up all night . I 'm not even tired . Yeah , staring up at the moon must be the cure for exhaustion , 'cause i don 't feel like i 'll ever need sleep again . Yeah , but what were we doing ? All of just standing there ? Who cares ? It felt good . I used to hate that " all join hands " kind of crap . But now ... Introducing norrie 2.0 . The mellower ... ( laughs ) Sweeter norrie . Seriously ? I was looking for you all night . I was stupid enough to even be worried about you . Joe ... I knew something was up . Why couldn 't you just tell me ? You obviously want your matrix life back- - Sororities , hunter . Not me . Let 's just end this . Christine : The living situation outside worries me . There 's too many people and not enough tents . Well , the houses were destroyed when the dome contracted , So there 's nowhere else for them to go . I 'd like to change all that . I 'd like to blow out the walls And fashion one large communal area . How would you do that ? ( sighs ) Remove the trim , cut through the drywall , Take out the studs with a reciprocating saw . See ? You retained the knowledge You gained in the other world . James ... ( long sigh ) Chester 's mill needs to heal from the wounds That your father inflicted . Tearing down his office shows everyone That big jim no longer has a hold on this place . If this is too hard for you , i understand . Someone else can handle it . ( sighs ) : But ... It might be good For you . Cathartic . Who are you ? Where are we ? Hey , what are you doing here ? Hey , slow down ! Wait ... Get the hell away from me ! Get away from me ! Get away ! No ! ( screams ) Please tell me you have the camera . What 's wrong ? Is it missing ? I had it last night ; this morning it was gone . Did someone see you with it yesterday ? Why are you assuming it was my fault ? Oh , my god . Maybe someone 's suspicious of you . I don 't understand why you 're still pretending to be a therapist . I am following the path set out for me In the alternate reality . Do you hear yourself ? You sound crazy . Oh , any crazier than thinking you 're pregnant ? Or holding hands with dale barbara In front of the whole town ? What happened in those cocoons clearly affected us . Yeah . The man i was with for what felt like a year Will barely look at me , and i 'm lying to him about who i am . Maybe the footage being stolen is a sign . Oh , no , it 's not a sign , it 's a screw-up- - we have to get it back . I 'm guessing that it was either jim rennie or julia shumway Who took it . Jim seems to have taken off , but julia , she ... Well , she 's two doors down at the motel . She is ? With dale ? ( knocking , door opens ) sam : Hey . Am i interrupting ? Not at all . Eva was just leaving . Thank you for letting me know . Rest assured I 'll ... Handle the situation . How 's the support group going ? Good . We had more people today . Coming together as a community is really helping . And how 's abby dewitt ? Is she coping any better ? She didn 't show this morning . I 'll track her down , make sure she 's okay . Thank you . How are you doing ? I 'm good . I still need to ask joe for forgiveness . Would you like me to talk to him ? That 'd be great . Be at the sweetbriar at 7 : 00 p.M. Tonight . I 'll make sure that joe 's there . You 're doing the right thing , sam . Julia : There 's barely one can per family . Well , when people get hungry , things get bad real fast . I saw it happen last year . You mean when you were in the cocoon ? Yeah . Hi . How are you ? I 'm good . Get me a blanket . Here , take ... My son , My son ! My son Is in there ! I got him . He 's okay . Get something under his head . Okay . Somebody have any water ? Okay . Sweetheart , here you go . These tents are too close together- - It 's dangerous . Yes , you 're right . Look , i know That many of you are without homes and others just want To be close to fellow millers so we can Lean on each other , which is why we 're Building dorms inside the town hall . Pete , right ? You worked construction before the dome came down ? We could just really use your help . James rennie is organizing a crew inside . Yeah , i 'll do whatever i can . Thank you . Using town hall for housing is smart , but ... Food 's still our real issue . Have you considered alternate sources ? Seeds , wild plants ? We 've pretty much combed through this whole town . I 've worked in famine-stricken countries , learned a few tricks . Can 't hurt to look again , right ? You could show me around town . Yeah , i guess i could . Wonderful . Maybe we can discuss the dorm plans . I 'd really love your input . His tests are negative . Contact with the egg hasn 't altered him . No need for that mask . 15 panels , all consistent . Malick ? Aktaion 's inside the dome . Julia : I wanted to thank you for yesterday . If you hadn 't shown up , melanie would 've killed me . Thank god that you were looking for food In exactly the right spot . Yeah , it was a lucky coincidence . Hunter , norrie . Where 's joe ? I thought that he was with you . He 's had kind of a rough time since we Got out of the cocoons and he ran off somewhere . Well , i 'll find him . What can we do to help ? More hunting ? You were hunting ? I killed a pig . Christine : Well , barbie and eva are out Looking for food , but junior could use You on his dorm-building team . I 'll show you . Do you mind Waiting here for me ? Of course not . Thanks . Come on . What are you doing with that ? It ... Looks like my voice recorder . I was a reporter . Carried it everywhere . After the dome came down i lost it in the chaos , So when i saw this ... In my drawer ? Well , you 've only been here a day . I didn 't think you had time to furnish an office . You were snooping . I don 't blame you . I would 've done the same thing . I 'm happy to answer any questions you have . What 's on the recorder ? Notes about my clients . What happened in those cocoons left people reeling . I 'm just trying to help . So you keep saying . It 's the truth . Could i have that ? I don 't want to betray their confidences . I found something in the caves . Maybe you can help me figure out who it belongs to , Since you seem to know everybody so well . Better than me , even . What did you want to show me ? Found it at the tunnel 's exit . ( chuckles ) finally , a question i can answer . It 's my i.D. Badge from the university of zenith . Oh , you teach ? Jack-of-all-trades , huh ? Yeah , i like to keep busy . Hmm . What happened between barbie and eva Must be very difficult for you . Well , that wasn 't real . This is . I 'm still impressed that you 're okay with them Going off together after what happened last night . Oh , he didn 't tell you ? You know , i 'm available if ... You need to talk . It was really great Talking to you , christine . Big jim : Well , well , well . If it isn 't my old buddy malick . From outside the dome . Tell me about the egg . Egg ? Oh , you , oh , you mean the egg that i gave you After you promised my family would get out ? Somehow it got back in here , along with your company . How 'd you get in ? Where 's the egg ? Oh , i bet you 'd like to know . You 're scared . All these tests , The isolation . There 's something inside that egg , isn 't there ? And you think it infected me . Well , you 've got it wrong . I 'm not the one you should be worried about . We made a deal once , malick , but you never followed through . Now here 's your chance . I can tell you All kinds of things . And you better act quick , Because you 're right- - What 's inside that egg is scary as hell And it 's already been unleashed . Barbie : We lost most of these crops to an infestation . The rest of ' em to a freeze . Was that before or after the frogs fell from the sky ? The frogs are still on our bucket list . I thought morocco was tough . Do you remember that hailstorm ? You mean the hailstorm that started In the middle of a sandstorm , right ? Pellets the size of a softball . We had that crappy little tent and one sleeping bag . Yeah . Didn 't think there was any way We were gonna make it till the morning . We did . We made the most of the night . Now all i can think about is how you 're sleeping In the same motel as me , Two doors down , but with her . Seeds . They 're viable . We could harvest them , start planting . Yeah , corn 's gonna take months to grow . We 're gonna be out of food in days . Well , it 's a good long-term plan . We just need to figure out the short term . Who 's this optimist ? 'cause you 're a realist . That 's true . But i know you . You 're not gonna let this town starve . What 's that ? Barbie : What- - the silos ? Yeah , we already thought about those . They 're filled with cattle feed . Cattle feed ? Yeah . Hmm . ( whistling ) do you think joe 's all right ? Yeah . Christine will talk to him . Yeah , i guess . ( stops whistling ) Keep moving . We 're waiting on you . So , nor , i was thinking Since joe 's not here , There 's no reason we can 't pick up where we left off . We 're supposed to be working . I didn 't mean right now . But i bet we could find an empty closet around here . You 're such a romantic . I just keep thinking of how crappy it was To let joe see us like that . He had a right to be pissed . I would 've been . So ... Next time You see him , apologize . What else can you do ? I don 't know . It 's just ... It feels like a year has passed to me , But for joe it seems like it was just the one day . That makes no sense . He was in the alternate reality , too . He 's a big boy . He 'll figure it out . What are you doing here ? Looking for you . Got a nice tour of chester 's mill in the process . This place blows . Under the dome , Not under the dome- - ( scoffs ) Doesn 't matter . Is this about norrie and hunter ? Norrie 's changed . Hunter , too . And part of me wants to be like them , but ... Something 's holding you back . Your grief . I saw a dead body yesterday . Andrea grinnell . Yeah , made you think of your sister . Of course it did . But it 's more than that . I want to feel better , But i don 't want to be like norrie or hunter . Something about them is just off . Yeah , i hear you , joe . But ... I want you to just consider That frustration Might be clouding your view . You see that norrie 's happy and you 're not And it upsets you . Maybe . In the alternate reality we spoke about How grief was weighing you down . But remember how good you felt When you finished your college portfolio ? Having a ... A sense of purpose Helped you let go of the past . You need something to make you feel Like a part of our group . Part of our kinship . Like what ? Well , this town 's got all kinds of needs . Your choice . Can i ask you to do one thing for me , though ? Sam came to me today . He wants to meet with you . Finish the conversation that you started before . Yeah ... He 'll be at the sweetbriar tonight at 7 : 00 . Just consider it . But for what it 's worth , I think you 're ready to forgive him ... And to finally move on . Abby ? Abby , you here ? ( gasps ) Uh , uh ... ( choking ) Abby . Abby ! Abby ! Come on ! ( coughing , gasping ) Slow breaths . In and out . ( coughing , gasping ) You 're drunk . I figured if it ... Was my last day on earth , i might as well enjoy it . What happened ? I just couldn 't bear it . Not for another hour Or another minute . I was up on that chair half the day . When i heard the door open , i just went for it . ( groans ) At least i 'm not alone anymore . You don 't want to do this . The dome 's gonna come down for real one day . You 'll be reunited with your baby . Even if that happens , I am never getting her back , okay ? Surprise . I know You think i lost my daughter 'cause of the dome , But she was long gone before that . Social services took her right out of my arms . I can help , abby . You messed up once , But you can change . Who are you trying to save , Me or you ? 'cause i thought the same thing when i got pregnant . I thought i was gonna clean up and be the best mom . But then it was 2 : 00 a.M. And the baby was screaming and the bottle was right there . There 's no fixing me . ( sniffles ) ( crying ) trust me . Took a crew out to one of the houses that was crushed . That 's great . Thank you . Hey , if it buys me a place to live , it 's all good . I 've been freezing my ass off at night . We 'll move people in when construction 's complete . Why wait ? Eh , we want to do this fairly . Everyone at the same time . Oh , man . Don 't feed me that bullcrap . I know how your daddy runs things . Like father , like son . I 'm nothing like big jim . I don 't hand out favors . Ah . It 's because of her , isn 't it ? Who ? Christine price . I saw how she worked in the alternate reality , Always giving orders , never taking ' em . She told you what to do , didn 't she ? At least i respected big jim . Only thing i like about christine Is watching her walk away . ( grunts ) We don 't make deals . ( grunts ) It 's simple . Tell us about the egg , or we torture you . And this ... This is a preview . Wait , wait . Stop . I know where the egg is . I stole it . It 's here on bird island . Take me to it . Me and my boss . Right now . Let 's go . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) : Come on . Get up . Not a sound . ( panting ) Don 't move . You 're gonna take me to the comm station outside . We 're gonna talk to whoever 's in charge , And we 're gonna make a little trade , Your life for my ticket out of this godforsaken dome . Any questions ? Which way ? Drop the weapon . I 'm walking out of here . You try to stop me , he dies . Mm-hmm . ( gunshot ) You killed your own man . Yes . For the egg . Where is it ? You need me . If i die , You got no one to tell you where the egg is . Barbie : People eating cattle feed ? I didn 't think that was possible . Eva : The feed had to be pulverized and fermented And it tastes disgusting , but it 's digestible . ( grunts ) ( muffled thumping ) That 's a good sign . All right , there 's a window up top here . Anything ? There 's feed ! How much ? Well , it looks like enough to hold us over Till the crops start producing . ( shouting ) Dale ! Hang on ! Okay . ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( grunts ) one , two , three . ( panting ) What are those ? ( joe grunting ) Solar panels . A bunch of ' em got pulled off of people 's homes When the dome was magnetized . Might be able to use ' em to get the power running again . I 'm impressed . And you 're out here getting creative , While everyone else is at town hall doing ... Christine price 's bidding . Actually , it was a conversation with her That made me think of it . Guess she found you before i did . It was a good talk . She thinks my issues with sam are holding me back . Your issues with sam ? That man murdered your sister two weeks ago . Why does she care ? Why do you listen to her ? What she says just makes sense . We all have to work together now and get along , Help the kinship . ( chuckles ) " the kinship . " i 've never heard you talk like that . That 's what christine calls it . Oh , my god . Christine works for aktaion . No . No way . Christine 's a therapist . That 's what she said , but i found her badge . She said it was her university i.D. That looks exactly like the aktaion logo to me . Joe : You 're right . So ... Christine 's been lying to us ? About that and who knows what else . Eva : It 'll have to be ground down , boiled , and we have To find a fermenting agent , but it 's doable . Great work . You two make a good team . Yeah . Well , i should , uh ... I should get home . Junior : We need to take it out to open up the room . Pete : You can 't . It 's safe . I checked The plans . Well , you better read ' em again , Because , i 'm telling you , that column is load-bearing . Look , i know how to read blueprints . Oh , In la-la land , maybe . Here in the real world , i spent Five years working construction . You take that out , The whole place is gonna come crashing down . Christine ? ( chuckles ) come on , man . Really ? She is probably the only person here Who knows less about this than you do . Hey , let the big boys handle this , sweetheart , all right ? Hey . Hey ! Move . My team , my call . Get out now . You are gonna regret this . All of you . Good job . ( chuckles ) Oh , my god . Where did you find chocolate ? Andrea had some . I figured keeping one bar wasn 't gonna hurt anybody . Thank you . Today has not been my favorite day ever . Well , it 's not all bad . ( chuckles ) We 're together . Um , i thought this was what you wanted . It is . I ... Just not right now . Right . I guess you 're used to joe . What 's that mean ? He 's a kid . You 're not . We 're a better fit . Yeah , we might be , but i can 't tell because all You care about is screwing me . I thought we were just having fun . If you want to talk or whatever , I can do that , too . No . You know what ? This just isn 't me . Abby : You 're wasting your time , sam . I am done pretending that i can move on , all right ? I hurt my kid and there is not Enough absolution in the world ... In the alternate reality , you got her back . It was a fantasy , sam ! A lie , all right ? It never existed and it never will . You killed a girl . You stole her from her family . You think saying sorry changes that ? It 's all i can do . It 's not enough . No one will ever forgive you . You 're just like me , Beyond salvation , beyond anything Other than another drink . ( door opens ) How 'd it go ? We found food . Cattle feed , but it 'll work . That 's great . Christine 's got some ideas to make it more palatable . We need to talk about her . She 's not who she says she is . She works for aktaion . What ? The badge i found in the caves belongs to christine . She admitted it . She said that she works for aktaion ? No , she said it was her university i.D ... . But the logo is aktaion 's . I mean , maybe . Or maybe the university logo just looks similar . It fits perfectly . Barbie , this is aktaion . You father 's company . You know better than anyone how shady they are . They always wanted the egg , and now christine appears Out of nowhere trying to take over the town ? I don 't know how it all fits together , But christine is lying . Eva , too . You see ? Don 't bring eva into this . Eva is lying ! And so are you . You were with her last night , weren 't you ? Nothing happened . All right , well , then what did you do all night ? Look , this is complicated , okay ? You keep telling me you understand , but you don 't ! I 'm trying ! But you need to be honest with me ! I saw your face this morning ! You wanted to go with her ! We needed to find food ! Someone else could 've done that ! Come on . Yesterday you promised we were gonna get through this . I waited up all night to talk to you While you were with her ! Same thing today ! What am i supposed to do ? ! I 'm supposed to just-just sit here While you go off and screw her ? ! ( gasps ) I don 't know what 's going on But you need to leave . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( gasps ) I 've just been walking in circles Trying to ... Figure this whole thing out . Did you ? Ever since we woke up , I haven 't been able to shake the feeling i 'm pregnant . I know how weird that sounds . What we had ... That felt just as real to me as it did to you . I mean , the baby , Us . Did you take the test ? I haven 't looked at it yet . Where is it ? Right there . What 's it say ? It 's negative . Well , i guess it wasn 't meant to be after all . You should go . ( clears her throat ) I 'll be all right . ( sniffles ) ( crying ) ( quietly ) : Hey . ( insects chirring ) ( bell jingles ) Isn 't this better than whatever you were gonna do ? Yeah ? I like you this way . ¶ ¶ ( running footsteps , panting ) ¶ ¶ ( panting ) ( panting ) ( hammer cocks ) You don 't want to shoot me , red . I promise i 'm not the bad guy here . They kidnapped me . They ran tests on me . ( panting ) They work for aktaion . ( gunshot ) What are you doing here ? Shouldn 't you be off with your new boyfriend , Singing " kum-bah-yah " with the town ? Wasn 't feeling it . What about hunter ? Listen , joe , I 'm sorry . What we did was crappy . Really crappy . Whatever . I 've had a lousy day . Can i just go to sleep ? What happened ? Tell me . I was supposed to meet sam . He was supposed to ask for my forgiveness , Like in the matrix world . But ... He didn 't show . I was ready to do this huge thing- - Which i wasn 't even sure i wanted to do . I feel like an idiot for letting christine talk me into it . Why should you forgive him ? ! He killed angle ! And for him to not even show up after you agreed to meet him ? He should have groveled , And you should 've told him to go screw himself . I hate him ! I hate everyone ! Why are you smiling ? Because ... This is you . You 're back . What the hell was wrong with me ? I don 't know But i missed you . ¶ ¶ Does this mean i ... I should get a condom ? Do you have one ? Yeah . I have ... Like , a lot . Well , that 's overkill . But yeah . Definitely yes . Okay . Junior : What are we doing here ? I 'm taking my star pupil on a field trip . Back to where it all began . You did well today . Perfectly , in fact . But not everyone is falling into line . The longer they 're outside the cocoons , The more their humanity takes hold . But not to fear . There 's a solution . How can i help ? I have something special planned for you . In time , it 'll become clear . But for now You 're exactly what i need . ¶ ¶ Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

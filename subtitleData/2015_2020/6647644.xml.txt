Did you have any luck ? You know , with yours ... The network here is local . There is something blocking our transmissions , but I do not know what . I am trying to get to the bottom of it . Right . Why does not Bukes ask me himself ? Bukes , he is ... He is a little shy . - Shy ! - Yeah . Especially around cute girls . Alternatively , maybe he just chooses not to like you . With his record , that is unfortunate for me . Did you pull his file ? Drifter , I pulled everyone 's file . How many does it say ? It says eighteen . Just the figures , no context , right ! That is why he does not want to like you . Those figures may be hard to swallow , but that is the job . We are good at our jobs . So , how old were you when you were chipped ? I was eleven . Without it ? Paralysis . You have to wait until you are old enough . Did Harbinger sponsor that ? Yeah . Cured it . I thought I was institutionalized . You have no idea . You can keep staring but it will not make her disappear . Did she say anything to you ? She says we are being blocked , that is why there is no comms . She does not know why . She knows . I do not think so . Incredibly , she really seems to be as clueless as us . All the gear . No idea . Something is off . With the training ? With Mills ? Both . - Sir . - Sir . What makes you so sure ? That she is the problem . I have never been cut off before . I cannot reach anyone at T.A.C. I cannot reach home at all . There she is , with a radio in her head saying nothing . S.A.R 1258.512-002 What do you want ? Get out of here ! - What the fuck is going on here ? - I do not know . - Was that your weapon ? - No . Who the fuck is firing , man ? I do not know , man ! I just heard the firing . Loftus ? All right ! Cutbill fall back . Goodwin go with Loftus . Why do you keep asking me ? I told you , I do not know ! What happened ? Sir , I looked up and saw Loftus stood right there , and the next second he was gone . This is just part of the training , right ! - Loftus ? - Loftus ? - Loftus ? - Loftus ? Loftus ! I see him . Over there ! - Robinson , Hackett , follow me ! - Okay , Captain . Slow down , Cutbill ! Slow down ! Loftus ? Is he ? What is this ? Can you hear me friend ? - Sam ? - All right !

Look at me . Shut up ! - Should we take him off ? - Those lines , they are ... Those cuts are straight . It is like ... - Captain , let us get out of here . - Help me with him . - No , let us get out of here . - Help me with him ! Cutbill , shut up ! Mills , what is going on ? This is your target area from yesterday . What ? RECON-085 Sir , we have to get him out of here as soon . Move ! Move ! Mills ? Those are our positions . Hey ! Robinson , cover me ! Keep moving ! Captain , do you copy ? Over . We have to get somewhere where we can get eyes on . I cannot get a good shot from here . Captain ? Captain , do you hear me ? Copy . Anyone , this is Cutbill , do you hear me ? Goddamn ! Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Please , do not ! What the fuck is this ? Please do not ! Did you see them ? Not clearly . I saw a couple of them , took a shot . They must have pretty good armor , because I hit them hard . - Like the ones from yesterday ? - No , they are bigger . They are highest . My Marines are dying . Therefore , you tell me what you know . You saw them on that ridge . I am connected to the network , Therefore , I see them , yes . - You do see them . - Yes . So , turn the fucking things off , right now . - I cannot . - You cannot . You do not seem to have a problem turning everything else on and off . I cannot just turn them off . There must be a reason . Programming errors . I am running the possibilities . Look ! This is not a fucking equation . You just get a hold of some one right now . - You get us out of here . - Okay . - Or , you are going to be the next being shot . - Not , like this . She does not know , all right ! - Some programmer screwed up somewhere . - No . No . Screw-ups are not so efficient . I cannot find him . However , I found this . Not too far from here . We need to find him , sir . Goodwin , you got rear point . - Okay , I am listening . - She is useful . We cannot see them on the field pads , we cannot see them through the trees . However , Mills sees them . Does it occur to you that if she sees them ? They see her and us . It does not matter . - Does not it matter ? - No . Because I am telling your right now , we need all the help that we can get . Do you see the groupings on Hackett ? They hit her 3 times . The third time while she was spinning through the fucking air . I have been thinking about that , because that is all that I am thinking . They had us . They let us walk . Why ? They let us walk ! What about Cutbill ? Now , they could have finished every one of us . But , while she was there , they held back . It is not about her . Alternatively , you . Bukes ? They used them for practice target . Like Loftus . We are being tracked from the ridge . Move ! Hold on ! - Where is Bukes ? - I lost his track . This is Drifter , anyone copy ? Come on ! Let us keep moving . Goodwin ! Move ! Bukes , come in . Copy . Solid copy , Drifter . Who is with you ? I got Goodwin and Robinson . We are north about a ridge from the camp . Good . Mills is down . But I found a place to hold up . - We will come find you . - No . You will not find way through the dark . They will have no trouble picking you off . Stay put . We will regroup as soon as the light is better . Over . - Bukes , copy . - Copy . We need her . Copy . See you tomorrow . Over . How long was I out ? Nine hours . Drink this . Why did not you leave me ? I do not know . I am still thinking about it . While you were out of it . One of those machines shows up here and ... Then you had a moment or something . We need to find out . Why ? I cannot explain it . Find a way . Let us go . It is good to see you , man . You too . Is everyone in one piece ? Yeah ? They did not try for us . They could have . As far I make out , they were everywhere last night . Mills ? Yeah , it cleary ahead . All their signals are behind us . Let us get back to the drop zone . Wait until someone to send us a transport . Let us be ready this time . Stay low , Mills . He will need me for the door . I will be fine . Bukes ... takes Mills to the door . We need her to get in . Fine . Copy . Take it easy down there , Mills . We need your eyes . Clear . Come on . - Do you want me to handle this ? - Wait here . - Captain Damien Bukes . - Wait a moment , please . Wait a moment , please . Wait a moment , please . Surveillance drones . Mills . - Get the door . - Okay . Wait a moment , please . Come on . Come on . What happens if they cannot get through the door ? Smoke .

I was telling you to wait . - There is no way . - Yes , I could . - Why ... ? - Because I made them ! This shit makes no sense . Why are we here , Mills ? I do not know . Marines come here to train . I do not know why you are here , I only know that you were requested . And you ? Why are you here ? I write the program , design the prototypes . This is where they are tested . Do you have a good look at what you have done ? - What you have created . - Nothing like this ever happened before . The codes have advanced more than we could have imagined . But , if I can understand it , I can try to control it . It is a little late for that ! Do not you think ? - No , you do not understand . - Open your eyes , Mills . They are killers . That is all they are . She stood in the middle of that road , and none of them shot her . That is because they are trying to work out , if I am one of them or not . Yeah . So , we ... What are they ? They are your replacements . Replacements ? They are called S.A.R. Study . Analyze . Reprogram . They learn . Given enough to learn from then , they improve themselves . Like us .

We built them , so people like you do not have to die or kill anyone . That is not up to you . This is up to me . And , how has that worked out so far ? I live with it . Therefore , people like you will not have to . And you kill us . And you know it . Watch her . Half an hour and they will roll out it back . Do we fight them off here ? And wait for the transport .

There is a leader , the one who is responsible for all this . The S.A.R codes that is expanding in that one . That is the one I need to be with it when I detonate . I think that will stop it , before it goes any further . Do you know why they have not killed us yet , Bukes ? Because they have been pushing us , here . They will give you enough time to set up , and then they will come for you . Maybe I can end to this . By killing yourself ! Even if you survive the blast , it will wipe you clean .

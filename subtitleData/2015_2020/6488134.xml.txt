 No elf has ever traveled beyond the breakline . Without an army , you won 't survive . Which is why I need a guide . Slanter . Proposition . Your help in exchange for your freedom . You must be desperate . Dagda Mor has returned . The quest is more important than any one life ! You can 't let your emotions get in the way ! the Crystal seed must be carried To a place called Safehold . She 's not gonna help us if we keep her Dragged along like a prisoner . Are you sure you don 't want her hands free For some other reason ? Fire those stones up , kid ! They 're not working . Time for plan " B. " I told you I had a plan . I deserve the crown . No one deserves the crown . Then I 'll just have to take it . Long live the king . Shh . Come on . Where are you taking me ? It 's a surprise . I 've had enough surprises for one lifetime . Wil ! Wil ? ! Damn you . It still works . Climb on . See ? It 's fun , right ? I do have feelings for you . And you thought you 'd show me by sleeping with Eretria ? Only because I couldn 't have what I really wanted . Amberle ... It 's okay , you 're awake . What happened ? You were moaning in your sleep , princess . Dreaming about the mongrel 's pouty lips , no doubt . We need to go , this place isn 't safe . Why ? What did you see ? There 's a storm coming . A big one . We need to move . Let 's go . Where 's your brother ? Hopefully halfway to Tyrsis by now . He 's gone to petition the federation . He believes that building a coalition with the humans Is key to surviving the demon siege . Your brother is a fool , but no matter . We have more pressing concerns . The druid has been lying to us . Is this ... The blade of the warlock lord . Forged by the druid order to overcome dark magic . Strong enough to defeat the Dagda Mor . I thought this was destroyed after The second war of the races . So did I. But according to the codex , it lies concealed in a vault Beneath our city . Now the druid must have known that . Why would he hide such a thing ? You said he could be trusted , You said that he was the only one With the power to protect- - I know what I said and I know what I 've done . But if my fears are right , then we are vulnerable . I should have trusted you . I 'll find this blade . And if the druid proves to be our enemy , Then we will face him together . Thank you , son . You 're the only one I can trust . we need to find Safehold . We 'll rest when we 've reach the Mermiddon . Am I the only one who thinks staying the course Is a bad idea ? What do you mean ? That demon at the fort ? It knew we were coming . That 's impossible . Allanon said the Dagda Mor had a spy at Arborlon . The changeling . We saw it die . There could be another . He 's right . We need to find another way to the wilderun . there is no other way . Those mountains are impassable . There 's always Pykon . It offers passage through the rock spur And into the wilderun beyond . Pykon ? A fairy tale , princess . Pykon 's no fairy tale . My parents died in the dungeons Of that stinking Elvin fortress . While we argue , that storm is closing in . If you want to spend the next six days Walking around the damn mountain , be my guest ! I 'm outta here . Wait . Take us there . How long will it take ? Half a day 's climb , tops . Try anything , and I 'll let Crispin finish what he started . scouts , move out . And keep your eyes open . You shouldn 't be here . I just ... Wanted to see him . He cannot sense your presence . Or your affection . Then do something . You let this happen ! Heal him or ... I 'm trying , but his mind has gone dark . get me out of here ! Help me ! Resist him , boy ! Let her go ! Explain yourself . Go now . Leave me ! The king believes that the druid may have been corrupted By the very same demon leading the attacks . If that 's true , then allanon may have sent amberle Into a trap . Cat , I need your help . There is a weapon hidden in a vault below the palace . If the druid really is lost , it might be our only chance To defeat the Dagda Mor . I would do anything to avenge the chosen , But I don 't know of any weapon . But you know this palace . There are miles of tunnels below . It 's got to be somewhere that no one would think to look . I 've heard whispers about a chamber beneath the dungeons . Some of the servants say it 's cursed , but it 's just talk . Show me . Slanter , wait . no ... No . My people ! Slaughtered by demons . These monsters don 't discriminate . If we don 't unite against them , more innocents will die . I must say last rites , to release their spirits . It is our custom . we 're almost at the breakline . We don 't have time . We 'll make time . What are you doing ? We 've been at war with the gnomes for 30 years . Now we have a common enemy . This is an opportunity . Your earthly body yields . Flesh transformed to clay and ash to fertilize the fields . Born anew , conveyed on wings of light , To go with our fallen kin beyond the skies of sight . We should go . Don 't do this . Get back . Here ! It should be here ! Maybe it 's the next peak over ! Maybe it doesn 't exist at all ! Your stupidity is going to get us all killed ! well , I heard zero good ideas from you , captain ! here 's an idea- - I slit your throat And use your body to fuel our fire . Killing each other won 't get us off this mountain ! Guys ? Nice-looking fairy tale , isn 't it ? come on . Home sweet home . looks abandoned . Looks can be deceiving . who the hell is she ? Anyone else have a problem with this plan ? Following a creepy kid through an abandoned fortress ? Not at all . Welcome . Please forgive my appearance , It 's been a long time since we had any company . You were expecting us ? Mag saw you coming up the mountain . Where are my manners ? I am Dontes Remikin . My friends call me Remo . What friends ? Well , back when we were operational . These days it 's just mag and me . Sir , Crispin Edensong , Captain of the home guard of Arborlon . You commanded this fort ? I was an officer during the war . Now I 'm just a ... A caretaker . We heard this place might offer Passage beyond the mountains . There is nothing beyond the mountains but the wilderun . That is no place for elves . We 're on an urgent mission On the orders of king Eventine Elessedil . Then it is an honor to host such esteemed guests . I 'm afraid the passage you seek Was destroyed two winters ago . It collapsed in an avalanche . You should stay until the storm passes . We have food , hot water . Our provisions are meager , but they 're yours to share . Thank you . We will tell the king of your kindness . Good . Please , this way . A royal bath must be something . Rose petals in the water . Servant girls massaging your back . Another princess joke . What 's my line ? I didn 't know rovers bathed at all ? Something like that ? Well , at least we don 't lie to ourselves . We see something we want and we go after it . So it 's rover custom to jump into bed With every guy you meet ? Honestly ? It 's not just guys . What ? Afraid you 'll like it ? You and Cephalo deserve each other . That mark , what does it mean ? I don 't know , I 've always had it . I guess it 's just how my first owner Kept track of his property . What was that ? Nothing good . We rovers have a saying . " golden offers are iron at their core . " I don 't trust this Remo guy . And I don 't trust you . Your point ? That I know my own kind . And that pointy-eared son of a bitch Is lying about the avalanche . You know , if we found this place , So can the demons . Maybe we should worry about that And not some Elvin janitor . This fortress is impenetrable . Is it ? We walked right in the front door . I 'd feel better if one of us kept watch . No one 's stopping you , kid . Pardon the intrusion , but dinner is served . Remo , you beautiful bastard . I 'm so hungry I could eat a troll 's left nut . sure , I 'll take first watch . I don 't need dinner or anything . smells like death . Look at all these engravings . this must be the place . The druid 's book showed a symbol . We need to locate it . It 's got to be some kind of key . They all look the same . This is it , this is the one I saw . Find me one that matches that . That 's how we find the weapon . There 's one here . Put your hand on it . The codex says we need to touch it at the same time . Thank you . Don 't mind if we trade , do you ? Mine had too many peas in it . I hate peas . Not at all . I 've missed Elvin cooking . It 's an old family recipe . Where are they , your family ? After the fort was decommissioned , My wife and I stayed on to keep watch Over the surrounding troll settlements . She passed away a few years back . I 'm sorry . What about the men and women you tortured here ? Are you sorry about them ? Watch your tongue , rover . It 's okay . I know the terrible rumors people whisper about this place . We even spread a few ourselves , Hoping to intimidate our enemies . But pykon was a military outpost , nothing more . My parents might disagree , if I could dig their bodies up From beneath your floor and ask them . I know you hate elves , but we don 't murder prisoners of war . If your parents were prisoners here , we would have Released them when the war ended . Perhaps they chose to start a new life , Free of their burdens . Your ear ... It 's like mine . Was your mother human ? My mother 's dead . Sorry to hear that . So is mine . So pretty . What is that ? A seashell . It belonged to my mom . Said it reminded her of where she came from . Have you ever seen the ocean ? It 's like the biggest bath you ever saw . Blue and sparkly . I can stare at it for hours , Wondering what 's on the other side . Have you ever been outside ? For keeps ? Mag ? What ... What did you do ? It can be difficult , passing the time in a place like this , Just the two of us . There isn 't much in the way of entertainment . That 's why we 're so excited to have guests . Where am I ? Shh , it 's not safe . If he hears you ... you 're right . It 's not safe . I need to go , and you need to come with me . I can take you somewhere safe , Somewhere you can play with other kids . Somewhere you can see the sun and the ocean . Are there seashells there ? More than you can count . come on ... Stop struggling ! No ! I told you to be quiet . Ah , good , you 're awake . I was worried I 'd given you too strong a dose . A little wolf 's nettle to bring on a nap . Of course If you eat enough of it , like I do , Your body builds up quite a tolerance . Your turn , captain . Wait ! don 't tell him anything . My name is amberle Elessedil . Granddaughter of your lord and king , And by his command I order you to release us ! Bad idea . A princess ? That changes everything . you bastard ! My intention was to use the boy 's gift to reach amberle . I thought he could help . What I saw was a man overcome by evil . You are not capable of understanding what you saw ! You 're not yourself , allanon . The Dagda Mor used the boy to get inside my mind ! The Dagda Mor . Of course . The evil everybody fears , but only you can see . Tell me , druid , do you often commune with demons ? What is the meaning of this ? Why conceal a weapon that has the power to protect us ? To protect you ? That sword is not a salvation , It is a talisman of evil . A darkness that is a danger to us all . It is you who are the danger , druid . It was my mistake . I should have killed you the first time , demon . Finish him . Where did he go ? What happened ? You did it , my son . The druid is no more . Why are you doing this ? because I was trained to . I don 't understand . Please help me understand . Many years ago , your grandfather , The noble and wise king Eventine , Tasked me with the job of lead interrogator . It was my solemn duty to extract information From our enemies . But I am not your enemy . Oh , but you are . You all are . And after the war was over , Eventine sent men here to find me . Imagine my surprise when they told me Pykon didn 't exist . Then they murdered my wife and attempted to kill me . I don 't believe you . My grandfather is an honorable man . He wouldn 't- - it doesn 't matter what you believe . I know the truth . Please . I 'm on a mission to save the Crystal . If I die , the entire world will fall into darkness . I 've lived in the darkness for many years . Darkness is my home . No ! No , no , no , no , no ! no , please , no ! The halfling ? He tried to leave . Wil ! No ! No ! No , no ... Good girl . No , please ... Come on , kid . That 's it . For the forebrain . I stick it through the nostril and tap it in Ever so gently with this . You can bear me a child , live as my wife . Just like mag 's mother . She was scared , too . But after a few taps , no more tears . But your body will be perfectly functional . No ... Leave her alone ! Wil . I 'll leave you one eye so you can watch While I ravish her ! Thank you . I thought I 'd lost you . Hate to break up the honeymoon , But I 'd really like to get the hell out of here . You 're safe now , but we need to go . You know a way out of here ? All right , this way . This is madness . We 're lost . How could I have been so stupid ? I can 't believe I trusted a gnome . I thought I could Redeem myself for failing to protect Aine . Instead , his killer is galloping across The four lands to freedom . We all failed him . Everything changed that night . Yes , it did . The Ander I loved disappeared , Lost in booze and anger and doubt . But I wake every morning hoping he 'll return . Slanter . You were right . I didn 't believe until I saw it with my own eyes .

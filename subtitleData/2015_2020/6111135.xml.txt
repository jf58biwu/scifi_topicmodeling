 Where am I ? I see ... You lied ? To let Seylum escape ? So that 's it ... That was your conclusion when you guessed at what I wanted . Milord Slaine . What is it ? There is a firefight in the hangar . Their assassination team ? Milord . Princess Asseylum ! I will cover you ! Run ! Eliminate the Terrans ! Enemy attack ! Enemy attack ! Perform emergency launch . Milord . There is a battle outside . as well . Get us away from the battle zone at maximum combat speed . Retreat ! Highness ... Inko ... Where is Princess Asseylum ? Still no word from her ! She didn 't ... manage to escape ? No ... Mission complete ... come pick me up ... Count Klancain . It was not my wish to get you involved . Not at all . This is part of my mission . Mission ? I came here under orders from His Majesty himself . From Grandfather ? Emperor Rayregalia had misgivings regarding the subjugation of the Earth system after the death of the previous Count Saazbaum . he commanded me to both investigate that and to ensure your safety . Then I must get in contact with Grandfather ! It is possible to make contact . However ... transmission from the moonbase . Put it through . where are you taking Princess Asseylum ? Lord Troyard . I am in the process of evacuating her to protect her from harm . The moonbase is a fortified installation . There is no safer location . a battle was in progress there . the enemies within the base have already been eliminated . Please return at once . No . I will not go back ! I ... watched birds on Earth . Highness ... and humanity and nature were coexisting . It was you who taught me this . That humanity and nature ... Earth and Vers ... could prosper together ! Yes . You are right . I did indeed say that . I have dispatched the Stygis Squadron to pursue . Seize the ship at the first opportunity . stop the war . And make peace with Earth . Perhaps you are right . Very well . Let us discuss the matter . Slaine ... That sector is dangerous . Please return immediately . please turn back at once . I am afraid I cannot comply . I must obey Princess Asseylum 's orders . Stealth to maximum . Milord . The spaceship Hadriacus has vanished from our screens . Continue your search . Milord . We needn 't worry about any pursuers for the time being . Thank you . But ... what am I to do now ? Earth 's military is trying to kill me . as well ... I must make contact with the crew of the Deucalion somehow . Milady . There is one knight who is on your side . The one who delivered the message from Inaho Kaizuka . Count Mazuurek . Now is the time to demonstrate my loyalty to Princess Asseylum . lift off ! Clydesdale Leader to all units ! Target the enemies off the ship 's starboard bow ! Don 't let them get close to the Deucalion ! 60 ! Increase AA cannon fire to starboard ! ma 'am ! Withdraw ? Looks like they got their results . ma 'am ? The real operation that used us as bait . Prepare to withdraw ! Order all units back to base ! 11 closing in . They 're on a return course ! It 's Inko and Inaho ! They 're cleared to land . Get them aboard ASAP . eh ? What are they playing at ? the UFE is withdrawing . Shall we pursue ? return to base . They are to rearm for our next offensive . summon the Landing Bases . Assign them to moonbase defense . Milord . Does that belong to my sister ? Princess Lemrina ... Did my sister – I see . Will I ever see her again ? Yes . Count on it . I feel sorry . For her . And for you . Inaho ... What is Lt. Kaizuka 's condition ? It 's nothing life-threatening . What worries me is that the Analytical Engine is putting a strain on his cranial nerves . but look at how far he expanded its domain ... What does that mean ? He 's ceded part of his brain to the machine . Damn crazy kid ... I must do something to put an end to this war . I will address all of the Orbital Knights . that alone may not suffice . Why ? ! the Orbital Knights have desired to fight Earth and occupy it . Count Troyard has given them a pardon to do just that in the form of a royal decree . He has unified them with guarantees of status in the new kingdom and Aldnoah activation privileges . it was his betrothal to you that clinched it . If you simply call for an end to you will only lose their trust . pretending to be you . Princess Asseylum . It is good to see you well . Thank you for being so kind as to assist me . Highness . I am relieved to be able to repay my debt . - Your debt ? - Yes ... to the Terran boy . To Inaho Kaizuka . I 've received reports that a part of your force went to the moonbase . Capt. Magbaredge ? It was an on-the-spot call . we lose any chance at peace for good . Why would Slaine launch a war like this ? Milady ... and loved the Earth . He was not someone who would engage in pointless war ... Why would he do this in spite of that ? Milady ... Lord Slaine has not changed at all . I do not know if his actions are right or wrong . But he has always cared deeply for you . or even his life . Always ... believing that you would awaken one day ... Yes ... I suppose that is true . Eddelrittuo . Are you able to make contact with Vers ? His Majesty is ... This is no time to stop at half measures . Count Klancain . I require your assistance . I shall use the Hadriacus' audience chamber . Princess Asseylum . all forces . Operation will commence as planned at 1500 hours UTC . Man your battle stations and stand by . you 're going into battle ? but never got the chance . That doesn 't sound like you . we 're in a low-pressure environment . I don 't want to drink myself sick . not that . This won 't be the last time . when I get back ! Is this one of those " final showdown " situations ? wouldn 't it be ? I guess that was the final showdown for him . Sheesh ! okay ? He 's right ! We 're all going to make it back in one piece ! the UFE has begun to mass its forces . What shall we do about them ? This changes nothing . Launch all forces and intercept the UFE . we will request the assistance of the Orbital Knights who back us . Milord ? We will launch an all-out offensive against the entire Earth . They will know how it feels to have nowhere to go home to . Nao ! Yuki ... Nao ? Yeah ... Thank goodness ... You did good today . Take it easy for a while . He 's going to launch an all-out attack . Is it almost time for the mission ? Don 't even think it ! Stay in bed ! Yuki . Something 's come up that I have to do . Nao ! let me go . There 's that face that says you 're going even if I say not to . so you may as well give in . let 's have dinner together . That 's a death flag right there . Hey ! Don 't talk like that ! you got that ? Yuki . Inaho . Feeling better ? Yeah . Is this ... ? the Sleipnir Final Showdown spec ! though ? Getting close enough to use this in a space battle would be nuts . It looks like things are going to get nuts . Are you serious ? ! He 's not taking this seriously at all ! Inko ... Why are boys always like this ? you 're in no condition to go into battle . Let us handle it from here ! I can 't do that . Why not ? Do you think you 're some hotshot ace ? That you 're special ? I 've never thought that about myself . Inaho ! Why are you acting like you don 't see it ? you might not make it back this time ! There won 't be another miracle like last time ! I don 't want ... to go through that again . I can 't be the only one taking it easy . Inko . the kindest thing to do is say nothing and see him off . We need to worry about ourselves right now . you know ? too ! Inko . Calm . Don 't worry . Everyone will make it back . My left eye says so . on . check . check . start . Ejection seat functional . IFF confirmed . activated . All systems green . ready . Grandfather ... Grandfather ... it is I. It is Asseylum . Do you recognize me ? Asseylum ... You look well . I am weary ... How goes the subjugation of Earth ? I have come to you today to ask a favor regarding that . I want you to make peace with Earth . Please give a direct order to the Orbital Knights to cease fighting . I cannot do ... Grandfather ... Earth can never be forgiven ... Do not let our assault falter ... Bring them under our dominion ... Grandfather ... Why do you hate Earth so ? Where is Gillzeria ? What has become of my son ? Conquer the Earth at once ! Father passed away ... During Heaven 's Fall . Asseylum . I am right here . Vers . That is what the ancients called this world . What they called Mars . Grandfather ... Rejoice ... For I have discovered a Martian superscience ... It is called ... Aldnoah . Magnificent ... Mankind will make even greater strides . Aldnoah is the technology we dreamed of ... It will make mankind happy . Yes . It is a great power . It must not be misused . Nurture it with care . I will . Asseylum ? How you 've grown ... You 've grown beautiful . Become a fine princess . And lead our people to happiness . I will . Klancain . I ask you to put your rank and all of your connections at my disposal . gladly . Count Cruhteo . Martian bastards ! Glory to Vers ! What the hell is that ? ! Slice them up ! wipe them out ! Open a channel . I wish to address all Orbital Knights . Milord ! An all-out battle has begun between the moonbase and the United Forces of Earth . My fellow knights who have gone down to the Satellite Belt and to the surface . Launch a concerted attack against the UFE in your respective locations ! Demonstrate our vast power to the Terrans once again . And show the UFE that resistance is – . Orbital Knights of Vers . Princess Asseylum ... Princess Royal of the Vers Empire . and has grown into a massive war . What 's this ? A pirate broadcast ? It 's being transmitted on all bands . resulting in great tragedy . This is a sad thing indeed . This war has brought me great sorrow . I feel both shame and a deep regret over our use of power that was not meant for us . I hereby ... and name myself Empress of the Vers Empire . to be my husband . wish to make peace with Earth ! Prayer of the Skies

 NOLAN : Previously on Defiance ... IRISA : I made a deal with the devil to save my father . This devil was a machine , a ship bent on destroying the world . It had big plans for me . It made me destroy New York City and hurt the people I love . BERLIN : What happened ? Did Irisa kill Tommy ? Yes . You remember Pilar , Rafe 's wife . You 're not still sick ? Never been better . ( GRUNTS ) And if you struggle , you 'll hurt the baby ! Pilar has kidnapped Alak and Christie . Do you know how many people I have killed ? Do you know how many people you can still save ? IRISA : To save the planet , we had to travel into the heart of darkness . The ship buried deep under the town of Defiance . He did it . Looks like we just saved the world . That 's it . Come on . ( RUMBLING ) I love you , baby girl . Any word on Nolan ? MERCADO : He disappeared . Old Saint Louis is gone . If Nolan was in the collapse , I 'm afraid he 's gone , as well . 7 MONTHS LATER The Tsuroz is shutting itself down . To conserve what 's left of its power . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Father ... I am frightened . Then let fear strengthen your resolve . Our mission must not fail . Ripped By mstoll ( SIGHS ) The gulanite is this way . It may be guarded . Too bad for the guards . BAILEY : Madam Mayor , the stasis nets just went dark . I ordered them to pull the plug . Gulanite reserves are down to 3 % . City charter stipulates that all power be diverted to heating and medical services . And they 're still asking for you at the NeedWant . ( SIGHS ) Of course . BAILEY : With the stasis nets down , the town is a sitting duck for raiders or whatever else comes through Bissel Pass . You think I don 't know that ? People are scared . Yeah , well , I 'm scared , too . Don 't tell anybody that . McCAWLEY MINES ( HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ) Better be an emergency , Lambert . I got a town to run . LAMBERT : Well , it 's Doc Yewll . She 's up 30K . Yewll ? She 's not a gambler . What 's she up to ? I don 't know , but if she keeps going , you know , she 's gonna clean us out . Doc Yewll . You don 't normally gamble in my establishment . Just cutting loose . Getting my ya-yas out . Winning big , I see . Yeah . You angling for a tip ? Here you go , legs . Now , scoot . ( GUNSHOT ) Everybody stay calm ! Hand over your cash , scrip chips and jewelry ! Don 't you move . Everyone does as they 're told , and everyone walks away ! Empty your pockets . Empty them ! Turn around . ( GRUNTS ) Move it ! Uh , I don 't think so ! Get that safe open ! ( PANTS ) Friend , I don 't run this place anymore . You 're still the owner ! But I don 't know the combination . ( ALL SCREAMING ) Okay . Okay . Let me guess . You 're an out-of-work miner ? Hap , is that you under that mask ? Just get the scrip ! Things are pretty desperate around here , aren 't they ? Mines collapsed , pow farms covered under a ton of snow , construction jobs non-existent . But this , this is not the answer . Shut up and give me the jekking cash ! ( GRUNTS ) Berlin ! Look out ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) You okay ? It 's been a day . ( SCREAMING IN PAIN ) This is a Votan ark . What 's it doing underground ? It must have crash landed . Yes . These life pods are losing power . ( SNIFFS ) ( GROWLS ) Daughter ! Not yet . No one will miss him . You must remain focused . We didn 't come here to feed . You have too many rules . I like his weapon . ( GASPS ) Where 's my daughter ? Do you speak Irathient ? ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( WIND WHISTLING ) Irisa ? ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTS ) Kiddo . Hey . Hey . Hey . Kiddo ? Hey . You okay ? - You okay ? - Your breath stinks . Oh , you 're all right . All right . ( SHIVERS ) Come on . ( GRUNTS ) How 'd we get here ? Where are we ? Oh . Thank Christ . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) OKLAHOMA CITY 500 MILES FROM DEFIANCE Any movement ? No . No patrols . Good . Come quickly , then . We spotted them . Bundle up , dear . It 's a walk . It 's an old joint Pilar 's parents had when she was little . Only my wife would be crazy enough to hole up behind enemy lines . ( STAHMA SIGHS ) Our grandchild . Have you seen Alak and Christie ? Not yet . They 're probably inside . If your wife has harmed them , she will die an excruciating death . And if she hasn 't harmed them ... Same outcome . I see your point . How do we get down there ? Well , the incline 's too steep . We gotta go around the long way . Come on , let 's get back to the roller . ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) ( SIGHS ) Nothing like the cold air to ward off croup . Does he need to be changed ? Yeah , but don 't worry , honey . Grandma 's got little Lukey . Votanis Collective death squad . They 've taken our vehicle . Shtako . STAHMA : We can 't let them discover the children . All right . ( SIGHS ) ( SNIFFS ) Make it look good . - Move . - Take it easy ! ( GRUNTS ) Stop where you are ! Drop your guns ! Don 't shoot ! When heaven falls to earth peace shall reign ! We are loyal to the collective . RAHM : Loyal to the Collective ? I shall be the judge of that . ( ALL LAUGHING ) I am General Rahm Tak . The Beast . You 've heard of me . I , however , find myself at a disadvantage . I am Datak Tarr of the Shanje Liro . Ah . I know the name . You 're from Defiance . A self-styled crime lord , are you not ? I have learned to make some small profit among the humans . Small indeed . Your donations to our common cause have been meager at best . And you 're only Shanje by marriage . My lady . I bask in starlit beauty . You shame me with honor , Favi Tak . Who 's the pink-skin ? Who you calling pink-skin , you Edgar Winter piece of shtako ? Say your name ! Tell the general your name . RAFE : McCawley . The name is Rafe McCawley . STAHMA : Please don 't kill him . The human is our bounty . There is a price on his head back in Defiance . ( LAUGHS ) You are in luck . My caravan is headed to your hometown . We 'll make camp here . We can travel together once we 've eaten and rested . I won 't take no for an answer . I 've been dying for some cultured company . General Tak , may I ask what business you have in Defiance ? You may indeed . I 'm going to kill all the humans and burn the disgusting place to the ground . Your winnings . You don 't have to do that . It 's all there . I count by twos . It goes fast . She 's gonna need it to pay her way across the Badlands . What are you talking about ? What 's with the packed bags ? Excuse me . Got a ticket on tomorrow 's land coach . Thought I 'd try my luck out west . This town needs you . What this town needs is a sensitively worded obituary . Defiance has faced harder winters than this . It 's time to get real . It 's been seven months since the McCawley Mines collapsed . Gulanite was the lifeblood of this town . There is no future without it . Oh , and incidentally , I just heard that the stasis nets went down . - Amanda , is that true ? - It 's temporary . Ah , so we 're only temporarily screwed . Good news . I depart with a clear conscience . Look . We 've lost soldiers , doctors , engineers , anyone with a skill marketable to the outside world . But you know who stayed ? The people who can 't leave . The people who can 't survive in the Badlands . Yeah , and they 're depending on people like us to keep it all together . Come on , Doc , you 're ... You 're the only doctor in town . If you leave , people will die . I don 't want that on my conscience , and I don 't think you do either . The fact that you try to appeal to my better angels is adorably human . So you 're staying ? Get your skinny ass out of here . I 've got work to do . NOLAN : Last thing I remember , uh , SUNFLOWER FLATS 7 MILES EAST OF DEFIANCE was the ceiling coming down on us . You were in my arms and I pulled you into one of those life pods . And , uh , it closed up around , we must have gone asleep . I wake up and we 're being pulled out by something . Some alien I 've never seen before . Older male , younger female , purple skin , real strong . This ringing a bell for you ? Did they cut you ? Yeah , must have . You got one , too . Well ... ( SIGHS ) Defiance is that way . We should probably go soon . I can 't go back . They 're gonna lynch me . It 's the only town . They know I 'm a mass murderer . I destroyed New York . Nolan , I killed Tommy . All right . Now , you listen up , because I 'm only gonna say this once . It was that Ark-brain that did the killing . Not you . You are as much a victim as anyone . You fought it , you beat it , and you saved everyone . I could not be prouder of you . They 're still gonna lynch me . Details , details . IRISA : What is that ? It 's a wormhole flare . Long-distance coded message . Votanis Collective . The V.C. isn 't normally this far north . I wonder who they 're talking to . What 's the message ? It 's good . Just got word there are five stasis nets down . ( LAUGHS ) RAHM : Datak , Stahma . Exciting news from my spies outside of Defiance . The gulanite shortage has apparently forced the town to pull the plug on the stasis net . Cause for celebration , no ? You 'll overrun them easily . And that pleases you ? Of course , Favi Tak . SOLDIER : General Rahm Tak . RAHM : I know I 'm not supposed to take this job personally , but I must admit , I 'm going to enjoy this campaign . I mean , the very idea of Defiance turns my stomach . I don 't know how you two live there . You know , I think I will hook a cable to that arch and pull the whole thing to the ground . Perhaps they 'll put a statue of me in its place . That is a beautiful dream . Was that sarcasm ? 'Cause I assure you , Favi Tarr , my aspirations are achievable . I am not a delusional man . There 's our signaler . The one holding the wormhole flare gun . I 've seen him in Defiance . They don 't look like soldiers . Why are they signaling the V.C. ? That 's because they 're spies . You go around to the right . That one 's yours . I 'll get the one by the truck . ( GRUNTS ) Don 't move . I said don 't move . You 're from Defiance . They wrote that book about you . What book ? I read it . Raised by a human father . Drop the gun ! Irathient girl . Come closer and I 'll shoot you ! No , no shooting . No shooting . We 're friends . I speak English , see ? Oh , look . You 're trembling . ( GRUNTS ) ( WHIMPERS ) I 'll show you what it means to be a real Votan . Irisa ? Hey ! ( GRUNTS ) Come on . ( GRUNTS ) What happened ? My weapon jammed . ( BABY LUKE WHIMPERS ) PILAR : Let me . I 've had three children , you know . QUENTIN : You have to keep one of them chained to a table so she won 't run away on you . Oh , I bet you spent all night thinking up that one . Check the traps , funny boy . Getting cold out there . I 'll go . I need to stretch my legs . Come on , where would I run to ? We 're in the middle of nowhere . ( SIGHS ) I know you want to kill me . Excuse me ? And I don 't blame you . I know how mad both of you are . But you don 't care . Oh , don 't say that . I care very much . And yet , here we are . Your parents are terrible people . They threatened me . They told me they would kill me if I stayed in Defiance . I could not abandon my family a second time , therefore , I had no choice but to bring you with me . Surely you understand that , as a father ? ( BABY LUKE WHIMPERS ) Sure . Then it 's settled . We 'll both go . Unchain him . Here you go , Christie . Here 's your baby . ( MOUTHING ) I love you . NOLAN : Looks like E-Rep pulled up stakes . IRISA : Good . Don 't be so sure . Earth Republic was the only thing keeping the V.C. out of North America . Come on . ( GRUNTS ) Last time we saw Amanda , she tried to shoot me . She considered shooting you . I remind you , she didn 't actually pull the trigger . Yeah . Yeah , you stay in the car . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( GUN COCKING ) Sure you can spare the bullets ? Where 's Pottinger ? He 's gone . I 'm back in charge . What 'd you do , stuff the ballot box ? This town 's on its last legs . I 've been hanging on by my fingernails . Where the hell were you ? Trapped under a mile of solid rock . How long have we been gone ? Seven months . Is Irisa ... Downstairs ? Yeah . POOLE : Excuse me . I knew it was you . Irisa , can you sign this ? It 's for my boyfriend . What 's it feel like , saving the world ? AMAZING GODDESS of the Badlands I bet it feels great , huh ? What happened to your head ? Uh-uh . ( GRUNTS ) Stasis nets are down . What the hell is going on with that ? Can 't spare the gulanite . Well , you 're gonna have to . You gotta get them up , and you gotta get them up now . You don 't understand . You don 't understand . The Votanis Collective . They 're coming for you . This book 's trash . I won 't sign this . ( GUN COCKING ) Take a walk , Poole . But don 't you know who this is ? Go home , Deputy . No , my shift doesn 't end for another hour . I 'm the lawkeeper now . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Ah ! ( GROANS ) These are all the weapons that are left in the armory ? There was looting when the E-Rep bugged out . ( SIGHS ) All right . I guess it 's gonna have to do for a start . The real issue is power . We don 't get those stasis nets back up and running , this war 's over before it begins . Come on . - Where we going ? - To the gulanite mines . There 's no point . Why not ? The mines collapsed the night you disappeared . The ground hardened into I don 't know what , but our drills can 't cut through . The gulanite 's down there , but we can 't access it . And yet , somehow , Irisa and I found our way out and made it to the surface . So there 's gotta be a tunnel or something . You don 't know how you made it to the surface ? No , but the purple-skins do . - Purple-skins ? - I 'll tell you on the way . ( GRUNTS ) Hey ! Berlin ! - What the hell are you doing ? - She killed Tommy ! A machine killed Tommy ! You lay a hand on her again , and I don 't care who you are , I will put you in the ground . That hardware always been there ? No , it 's new . Thought you said no one was home at the mines . I did . ( SIGHS ) Looks like someone set up shop for themselves . This tech 's Votan , Indogene . Looks like our squatters are from your neck of the woods , kiddo . I 'm from Denver . Oh , baby . Come to papa . The purples took my gun , so we know we 're in the right place . They have terraformers . What the hell was that ? Not waiting to find out . ( GRUNTS ) Strong pulse . She 's just stunned . Come on . On me , you cover right . ( CHATTERING ) Rahm Tak . - Is there something wrong ? - No talking ! Come . Quickly . We found some humans . Should be educational . Well , somebody 's been busy down here . What the hell do they want with all this gulanite ? ( GROWLS ) ( SIGHS ) I wanna get my hands on one of those drones . Figure out how they work , we might get a beat on who or what we 're dealing with here . ( GROWLS ) I remember you . You wanna tell us what you 're doing in our mines ? ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) Oh , feeling frisky , are we ? ( GROWLS ) Drop the weapon ! Drop it ! You guys okay ? Yeah . Did you have to shoot her in the gut ? I was aiming for the legs . Look , I 'm a little shaky after being zapped by that thing . Is she gonna live ? Not unless we get her to a doctor fast . Grab the roller . ( CRYING ) It 's V.C. patrol . I 'm gonna go talk to them . Then unlock the chain first . Mom wouldn 't like that . Luke is half Casti , half human . Do you know what the Votanis Collective does to mix-breed babies ? ( SIGHS ) Find a good hiding place . Greetings ! When heaven falls to earth , peace shall reign . Yeah , yeah , boring , boring . Do you know who I am ? Rahm Tak . The Beast . I 'm on your side . I worked as a spy for the Collective . I assassinated Earth Republic Ambassador Tennety . What did you say your name was ? Quentin McCawley . McCawley . McCawley ? McCawley , McCawley , McCawley , McCawley . Never heard of you . ( SCREAMING ) No ! ( SCREAMING IN DISTANCE ) ( SOBS ) Oops . Was that your son ? McCawl ... There was no reason to kill him . He just did it out of spite . I 'm sorry , Rafe . As family , we will all bear this ... grievous loss ... and take vengeance together . Thanks , Datak . It means a lot . STAHMA : Someone 's coming . The general is asking for you two . RAHM : Stahma . You said you captured Papa Bear McCawley somewhere around here , right ? Yes . And yet , you failed to notice that he had a son running around loose . We 're as surprised as you must be . Clever humans . I 'm beginning to think you 're the clever one , Stahma . ( SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( KNIFE SLICES ) ( CRASHING ) Ah ! Look at this . I found a mouse . CHRISTIE : This is a private home . You have no right to be here ! So ? ( GRUNTS ) The baby . We need to get the soldiers out of here . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) No ! Oh , Dad ! ( WAILING ) You 're all devils ! May Rayetso consign your soul to solitude and fire ! She 's ... She 's in shock . CHRISTIE : I am not in shock . I know exactly what I 'm saying ! May your liro stink of unclean death in the forever after of the Three Hells ! Oh . Forgive her , please . Stahma , did you teach this human the curses of our people ? This is your husband 's charge blade . I want you to kill this human with it . ( WHIMPERS ) Do it for me . I sense hesitation . Would you kill this human in exchange for your husband 's life ? Stahma . Make a decision . ( PANTING ) Stahma ! Make a decision ! ( GUN COCKING ) ( SIGHS ) I 'm not afraid . Ah ! No ! No . Shh . ( GURGLING ) ( KNIFE DEACTIVATES ) Thank you , General , for providing clarity . Of course , the only good human is a dead one . Favi Tak , may we leave this place now ? The human death-stink offends . RAHM : Of course . Move out ! ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) Oh , God . Oh , God . Please bring her back . ( SOBBING ) ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) Luke ? Luke ? RAFE : He 's hungry . Oh , baby , thank God . Remember how our kids used to cry like that when they were ... Rafe . Rafe McCawley , you wake the hell up right now . ( BABY LUKE WHIMPERS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( RAFE LAUGHING ) Oh-ho-ho . Alak , my son , you forget what happened here . You forget this day and you love this little baby like you loved my Christie . I should have been better . Me too . ( GRUNTS ) ( CRIES ) ( WHIMPERS ) What are you doing ? Waste not , want not . ( SNIFFLES ) What 's with all the cloak and dagger ? We 're keeping this quiet . We don 't want anyone to see her . Why ? Who 's the patient ? Enchanter , unholy taker . Can you help her ? I 'm not going anywhere near that thing . Let nature take its course . If you stand by and let her die , we 're gonna be digging two graves . Fine . Chain her up . Doc , she 's half dead . An optimist would say she 's half alive . Chain her up . Come on . So you know what she is ? She 's a predator . Designed by evolution to conquer , kill and devour . She moves like a hunter . Yeah , well , she eats like a cannibal . What kind of Votan is she ? There was an early Votan race , one that predated the rest of us . One that called the shots for a very long time . Congratulations . You found yourselves an honest-to-goodness Omec . Omec ? I 've heard the name , but I heard they died out . DOC : Supposedly they did . Back home , we built Arks to escape the exploding sun . Ours worked . Theirs didn 't . ( SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Hey ! We don 't mean you any harm . Conquer , kill , devour . Put it on a T-shirt so you don 't forget . AMANDA : According to Nolan , there 's another one . A male . Kill them both . You have no idea what you 're dealing with . ( DOOR OPENS ) That should keep you warm . ( SIGHS ) Do you speak Casti ? I 'm sorry for getting rough but you ... A good right hook . ( CHUCKLES ) Ka-pow . Ka-pow . Warm . ( GROWLS ) That 's it . Nice and warm . Very flattering . Kindzi . Nolan . Irisa . ( SNIFFS ) What the Doc said about you guys being cannibals , back there in the caves , when you licked me ... ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) You weren 't gonna eat me , were you ? ( GROWLS ) ( LAUGHS ) You understand me , don 't you ? Oh , um ... What brings you to my stall this fine afternoon ? Favi Ksaruko , hello . Monguno , how 's it going with that mandolin of yours ? Fine . He doesn 't practice enough . Uh how can I help you , Madam Mayor ? Yes , um , a Votan friend of mine was telling me a story today about the Omec . ( SIGHS ) " Devils , " as you humans would say . Enchanters , takers of the innocent , dark gods . AMANDA : Would you call them cannibals ? Only if I were a sloppy speaker . Cannibals eat their own species . Whereas Omec , they preferred eating us . " And on the eve of the final rotation ... " " ... the chosen were placed under waters and beneath stone ... " " ... for the devils would soon emerge from the stars for the ... " The Dread Harvest . Every 76 years , the Omec home planet , which is here , would come close to the other Votan planets . The Omec came in giant space vessels and spirited away thousands upon thousands of our ancestors . Those harvested were kept as slaves until their Omec masters grew bored . Or hungry ? Exactly . Those old stories are bogus . Bogus . ( CHUCKLES ) You ignore your people 's history at your own peril . I don 't believe in Omec . That 's because you are a foolish boy with work to do . Go . Pay no attention to my son . The Omec were very real . Very dangerous . ( DOOR SLAMS OPEN ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( GROWLS ) I 'm here for my daughter . OKLAHOMA CITY 500 MILES FROM DATAK : All well and good , General , but Defiance will not go down without a fight . How do you plan to take the city with such a small force ? We have a weapon . What kind of weapon ? She said it 's our little secret , and by golly , I 'm gonna keep it . It 's from a Johnny Cash song . Ah . Ah , The Man In Black . For a southern member of the Collective , your command of human culture , General , is excellent . After immigrating , I studied in New York . I lived with them , I ate with them . I know everything there is to know about everything human . Living with pigs , one grows all too accustomed to filth . Praise Rayetso . But please , don 't misunderstand , I desire that filth . Mmm . Consider sweet Lieutenant Bebe . An Indogene who wore a human skin to infiltrate a shopping mall , killing hundreds of humans . His skin is heroic . I call it poetry . We shall seize their human language , their land , their clothes , the very skin on their faces . Everything in this world is ours for the taking . Manifest Destiny . Do you know the term ? Oh , I know it 's a human concept . So well-informed , both of you . You honor us , General . The men are talking . I shame myself . ( CHUCKLES ) So , I am trying to decide how best to put you both to work for the Votan cause . Anything to serve the Collective , General . Good , good . Because you , Datak , are going to be a saboteur for the Votanis Collective . You are gonna help me bring that odious little town to its knees . If I may , General , without me there to calm him , my husband is prone to fits of intemperate anger . You 're saying I should send you both . It might help you achieve the objective you desire . Here 's the thing , Stahma , you and your husband are a pair of treacherous snakes . If I release you both , you 'll disappear into the woodpile and I won 't get what I want . So , I think it 's best for everyone if we set some simple ground rules . You , Datak , will go to Defiance . You will carry out assignments that I give you . Any time you refuse an assignment or fail , or displease me in any way , I will cut a piece off of your wife 's beautiful body . And over time , that can add up to one ugly bitch . So , do as I say . ( PANTING ) Do you even know where we 're going ? As long as the Collective are far behind us , I could care less . ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) Oh , I know . I know , baby . I 'm so sorry your terrible Casti grandparents ruined everything . I will protect you . What are you gonna do ? I am going to get food for my grandson . ( SIGHS ) ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) It 's gonna be okay . ( KNOCKING ) Help her up . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GASPS ) I found these in our mines along with my daughter 's blood . Well , you have nothing to worry about , she 's fine . Where is she ? Why don 't you answer some questions first ? Take me to her . Listen , I appreciate your patience during this trying time , but forgive me , I don 't know what to call you . Eksua Tsuroz T 'evgin . Eksua is my family , Tsuroz is my ship , and you may call me T 'evgin . You say you have a ship ? I believe I just did . Is it functional ? You are asking very invasive questions of someone who just recently saved your life . See , I don 't know that you just saved my life . Hmm . I know I woke up with a gash in my head . The head wound was from where the sleeper pod was hooked into your brain . The entire system was losing power and you both soon would have died , had I not taken action . Cutting the interface was to release you from the pod . And then you dumped us out in the snow and left us to die . You attacked us . I wanted to kill you , but my daughter pled mercy on your behalf . Speaking of which , you will take me to her now . Well , we still have some more questions you have to answer . NOLAN : Like , what 's with all the gulanite ? That ship of yours , low on power ? Need fuel ? When we arrived in Earth orbit our ship was low on fuel and badly in need of repair . And what happens once that ship is functional again ? Others may have survived , like my daughter and I did . We will travel into deep space and search for them . Just the two of you ? Yes . ( SIGHS ) All right , here 's the deal . Our town needs gulanite badly . I suggest a sharing agreement , 50-50 . Our mines , your equipment . Everybody wins . These are my terms ! You will bring me my daughter or I will bathe in the blood of every Votan and human until my rage is cleansed . Now where is she ? You finished ? I shot your daughter . But she attacked me first , which means I was within my rights . And we brought her back to town to seek medical care . She 's stable and she 's resting comfortably . Now , I will return her to you when you and I reach an agreement about the gulanite . So she 's a hostage . No , that 's an ugly word . ( GROWLS ) Should be you . Chained up . You 're the real menace . Can we see it ? There 's nothing to see , short stuff . Mayor came into my dad 's booth asking about Omec , and then one showed up outside the NeedWant . What ? You see Omec ? Didn 't your dad beat you once for calling him Omec ? There 's nothing in here . Then why is she guarding the door ? Leave . Now . Don 't piss her off . She 'll drop an Ark on your head . You are her . From book . Goddess of Badland . That book 's trash . Shtako , that is her . Why didn 't you kill it ? That Omec . You kill everything . You are murderer . Okay , boys , that 's enough . Bye . You are a murderer . She-bitch . ( CHUCKLES ) Guys , she 's alive . There 's totally an Omec in here . Check it out . Hey , yo , boost me up . ( GROWLING ) - What do you see ? - I don 't know , it 's dark . Hold on . Come here , little Omec . Come on . She 's still chained up , right ? What 'd you see ? What 'd you see ? Come here , baby . Come on . Get away from there ! Go , go . ( SCREAMING ) No . No , no . No , no , no . No . It 's okay . ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) Hey . Come on . Omec . Is it inconsiderate to say " I told you so " ? I never know the rules for that . Raised by wolves . You 're not funny . Fifty million Elvis fans can 't be wrong . Kill the Omec ! Get him out of here . You trying to start a riot ? Let 's go . Your Indogene was insulting . You Omec enchanter , ravager of the weak , devil ! Kill the Omec ! ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) Well , at least the baby ate . I lost my appetite . That little boy needs his papa to stay strong . Family is more important than anything else in this world , Alak . You sound like my parents . You mean the ones that killed my daughter ? Your wife ? His mother ? No . I very much do not sound like them . You murdered these people . How does that make you any different ? I kill strangers to take care of my family . Your parents kill family to take care of themselves . ( SIGHS ) ( SNIFFS ) You know , I tried to poison my three children . Christie was just a baby . It 's come up in conversation , yeah . I was sick . The Votan monastery that Rafe shipped me off to , it made me hard . But it also taught me to look beyond my own needs . I had to suffer so that my children would be safe . Safe from you . Right ? Yes . The shigustako offered redemption . Castithan style . I took it . I allowed them to abuse me . And then my dear , sweet Quentin found me . Forgave me . He saved my life . Because I realized that my family , my children , needed a mother . I focused on that . I wouldn 't let anything stop me , least of all your parents . ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) I am not your mother , Alak . I 'm Christie 's mother . You can depend on me . I wish I could believe that . I will never betray you . ( BABY LUKE CRYING ) Blood trail comes in from behind us . She went this way . Must 've reopened her gunshot wounds when she escaped . I don 't like the amount of blood I 'm seeing here . How do you think I feel ? So let 's go find her . Come on . Oh , my God ! Do you need a doctor ? She needs a doctor ! No , she doesn 't ! This Omec killed my son ! Step away from her . Please . Devil ! This is our new world . There will be no Dread Harvest . Stop ! ( GRUNTS ) Devil ! Devil ! ( GUNSHOTS ) Get on the ground ! Now ! All of you ! Down ! Show me your hands ! Get that on the ground . Stay down . T 'Evgin . No . No ! T 'Evgin , no ! Don 't worry about the bookseller . Not now . Look after your daughter . Look at her . ( GROWLS ) What is that ? Call it a letter opener . I 'll die before I leave you alone here with that ... Psychopath The McCawleys may have been human , but they were our humans . Rafe was shot down like a dog . He deserved better . And Christie . Make me a weapon , too . Better we die together , don 't you think ? I 'll get to work . ( WIND HOWLING ) ( GASPS ) Pilar ? No . No , no , no , no , no ! Pilar ? ( GRUNTS ) Luke ! ( PANTS ) ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) Hey ! Hey , please . She ... She took my son ! She ... She took my son . She just ... She took him . ( GASPS ) Please , we ... The Indogene ! Now ! Doc ! We got a situation ! Hey . Hey , hey , hey . Sweetheart . Hey , look at me . That 's it . Focus on me . That 's it . You stay with me . We 're gonna get you through this . Hey ! Hands off my stuff . Take it easy , Doc . Get this monster out of here . I 'm not gonna ask you twice . All right . She 's bleeding out . She needs your help . You misunderstand me . I don 't need the little Indogene 's medical expertise . I need protoform . Ah ! Whoa , whoa . Everybody calm down . What exactly is protoform ? Indogene skin ! The Indogenes are a manufactured race created for many purposes . To him , I 'm just a great big tub of spackle . - Stay back ! - All right , slow down . In order to save my daughter 's life , I need a strip of epidermis , six inches long and three inches wide . I can promise you that the Indogene will recover fully . Now , out of my way . If my daughter dies , your town dies along with her . No gulanite . Nothing . Nolan , hold her down . No ! No ! Kiddo . ( SCREAMS ) All right . Come on . All right . I have a sedative . No friggin ' way ! Sorry , Doc . It 's necessary . Is 20 cc 's enough to numb the pain ? Screw you ! Now , this is gonna go a lot quicker if you don 't struggle . ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) How is she ? Angry . And drugged . ( WHIMPERING ) Protoform is infinitely mutable . It has many applications that are beneficial to Omec physiology . Killing that Castithan boy was foolish . I was provoked . We are vulnerable . Until our ship is repaired we cannot afford to have this town turn on us . I am not afraid of them . You should be . There are hundreds upon hundreds of them , and only two of us . If we die , it means the extinction of our entire race . When our ship is powered and our family awakens , we will conquer these people . On that day , I swear to you , all scores shall be settled . Your ride 's here . You helped me save my daughter . I acknowledge this . It 's what we do around here . I also accept your proposal to share the gulanite . Come to the mines tomorrow and we 'll discuss the details . Thank you , T 'evgin . ( GUNSHOT ) Get back inside ! Rayetso bless my hand and grant me sight and clarity . End of the street . Favi Ksaruko ... I know you 're angry . My son is dead . You and your father and the mayor all fought to save the life of the devil that killed him . There will be no justice until she is dead , too . I 'm sorry for your loss , but Monguno was provoking her . She was scared and lashed out . You killing her or anyone else is only gonna make things worse . NOLAN : Yengi Ksaruko , you 're endangering the entire town ! Throw down your weapon where I can see it , or I will shoot you ! Toss the gun , Favi Ksaruko . You 're not a killer . You don 't know what it 's like . What killing does to you . I don 't want you to know . ( GRUNTS ) ( WHIMPERS ) You didn 't have to kill him . - He was shooting at us . - He was gonna surrender . You know that ? What if he wasn 't ? He would 've put a bullet right between your eyes . Nobody forced this man to pick up a gun and start shooting at innocent people . Innocent ? Right . Good luck . ( GUN COCKING ) Well done . Well done , well done , Stahma . I must admit you were right . You two are more formidable together than apart . Your wish is granted . You will travel to Defiance with Datak . You will spy for me as a team . I bet you 're thinking there must be a catch . Well ... Bebe . ( GRUNTS ) Alak . Stahma , sit with me . We 're gonna work on your cover story . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) World gone wrong Quiet song Let us sing of pretty horses Living free Riding high Together , you and I You make me live Whatever this world can give to me It 's you , you 're all I see Three , two , one . ( ALL CHEERING ) You make me live You 're the best friend that I ever had I 've been with you such a long time You 're my sunshine And I want you to know that my feelings are true I really love you You 're my best friend I 've been wandering round And still come back to you In rain or shine you stood by me , boy I 'm happy at home You 're my best friend Whenever this world is cruel to me I got you to help me forgive You make me live now , honey You make me live You make me live You make me live Ripped By mstoll

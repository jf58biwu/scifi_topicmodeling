Ah ... this is like in those movies where I 'm actually in a car accident and you guys are like my spirit guides or something , right ? - Well , now you 've gone and spoiled everything . - Maddie ... You 're a thought . - A what ? - A figment . I 'm a figment ... Edgar 's a figment . This whole place ... just in somebody 's head . - Like a portal ? Like a John Malkovich movie .

So ... uh ... I didn 't have a ride Um ... what are you doing out here , Mr. Willis ? - Oh , I went out to pick up a ... a few groceries and then uh ... I must have taken a wrong turn or something . - A wrong turn all the way to Silver Notch ? - Yeah , I know . It is the strangest thing . - Well , I am ... I 'm glad you messed up so badly , otherwise huh , it would have been a long walk home . - Yes , definitely . - You haven 't been drinking , right ? - Oh , no , no , no . Nothing like that . No . I have had trouble focusing lately . - Watch out ! - What , what , what what ? There 's nothing there ! - Um ... I thought I saw something .

I should probably let my mom know I 'm okay . Thanks , Mr. Willis . - Hey Maddie ... You better get inside ! Looks like a storm coming ! Gonna be a bad one ! [ laughs ] - Mom ? Ugh ... Tuna . I 'm so done with this ! - Maddie ? - Mr . Simms , I think she 's conscious . - Maddie ? Are you with us ? - Well , let 's give her some air . Alright . Get up , okay . Okay . Are you alright ? - Yeah , um ... What happened to the twister ? - Twister ? There was no twister , Dorothy . - No , no , no , no , ... . - I think you should go see the nurse . - No , no , no . There was a tornado . - Okay , that 's enough . Do want to go with someone else ? Do you want someone to come with you ? - No , I 'm okay , I 'm gonna be fine . - You ... you go with her . - Let 's just go . Okay . - Alright everyone . We have a lot of work to do . - So , Mark ... Tell me more about theses episodes you 've been having . - I didn 't come here for diagnosis , Toni I came here because you 're somebody I can trust . - I am . Of course I am , I 'm sorry . [ Mark Sighs ] - Things seem really strange lately . I can 't really explain it . - Uh , walk me through it . Alright , just tell me what 's happening . - Things are ... distorted . - Distorted ? - Yeah , it 's like ... the kids in the hallways . It 's like they can 't hear me . or like they 're seeing right through me or something . - Oh , you feel like you 're being ignored ? - Not so much ignored ... Listen , you hear that ? - What ? - Violin . I ... I hear it sometimes in my classroom . I heard it this morning in the cafeteria . You don 't hear that ? - No , I don 't hear anything . - I did my student teaching In New Mexico , in a Navajo reservation . I thought teaching here was gonna be really easy . 'Cause those Navajo kids , they had it really tough , because a lot of the kids would just quit school , uh , to help their families . A lot of the kids would just quit school , period . they ... they 're trying to fit into two different worlds at the same exact time , and they really don 't end up fitting into either world very well . it 's kind of how I 'm feeling right now . - Are you more stressed here ? - I don 't think it 's stress . it doesn 't feel like stress . Just things are distorted . like I 'm teaching class and I turn around it 's like the kids have vanished . You know ? Like I could see through them , or ... or ... . the kids have changed seats . - Yeah ... Um ... Well , that 's a pretty common prank . Switching seats behind your back , I mean these kids are going to do whatever they can , you know ? - It 's ... it 's more than that . I 'll go to the teachers ' lounge and it 's in a different place or ... or my grade book it 'll seem full one second , and then the next second , it 's like it 's empty . And then the violins . - Violins ? Listen to what you 're saying . Do you really think that these things are real ? - I ... I don 't know what to think anymore . I have to go to class . - See you at lunch ? - You really want to have lunch with a crazy guy ? - it 's just stress , Mark . Stress ! - Oh , Mr. Willis . Here 's my homework . - No , stay right there . Homework goes in my box , okay ? Remember protocol . Oh , I 'm so sorry . - that 's okay . - Sorry . - Hey Mr. Willis . we 've got to stop bumping into each other like that . Don 't we ? Oh . - Hey , Carl , what 's going on with the lights ? - He can 't hear you . not even really sure that he 's here and frankly I have my doubts about you , too . Crap , here it goes again . [ Maddie Sighs ] - I know ! I know ! Everything 's shifting around us . - Has this happened to you before ? - Yeah ! - Okay , so it 's not just me this time . So , so I 'm not the only one . it 's you , too , Maddie . - I know ! Isn 't it great ? it means I 'm not crazy . Unless we 're both crazy . Which do you think it is ? - This has been happening to me more and more over the last few days . Weeks ... or months . - Okay , the think that matters is that you see it too , I mean you 're the science teacher . Come on , help me out here . - Okay , okay ... um ... well it can 't be just some random event . there has to be some sort of a trigger . Alright ? If it 's happened to both of us . Uh ... you know ... cause , effect - Right . - Stimulus , catalysts ... Right ? I mean for every action there is a ... an equal and opposite reaction . Newton 's third law of physics . I bet if we could ... trace this back to the very first incident , we might be able to figure out what 's going on . Maybe . - Figure what out ? - Whoa . - What are you two doing ? - Us ? Where did you come from ? - Um , I 've been here the whole time , Maddie . - No , I was just in your office and I told you I had to get to class . - Right , and then we all walked here together . - N-not exactly . - Okay , what is this ? Have you been messing with me , Mark ? It 's not funny . - No , no . Maddie , I have arranged an appointment for you at the nurse 's . So we should go . - Oh , Tony , I think it 's great that you want to help , but I 'm not sure this is the right thing . - Okay , look , why don 't you do your job and let me do mine ? Alright , Maddie ? We need to go . - Here 's my homework , Mr. Willis . - Homework goes in the box . - Alright , let 's get this party started . - Hey , Maddie . - You want me to fill this up ? - Let ' er rip . Just go behind the curtain . - Oh , boy . - Ew , that was challenging to say the least . Miss Carloftis ? I have my pee ! - Are you gonna drink that ? - Huh ? It ... it ... no , no , no ... Je ... - What do you want , hoe ? [ Maddie laughs ] What did you just call me ? - You heard what I said , you little bitch . - Wow , um ... what 's gotten into you ? - You stole my boyfriend . That 's what . - What ? - You know what I 'm talking about . - You never had a boyfriend . - Did too ! - Okay , then what was his name ? - Harold . - Jess , that 's the name of your Hermit crab . - Jess , everything is changing around me ! You cannot change on me too ! You don 't remember anything ? Hiking ? Sleepovers ? Museums ? - Hey . I got a live one here . - Of course she 's alive , Deep . Can 't kill her . You mean she 's immortal ? - Maybe . I 've got a theory on that . - Ah , you and your theories . - Maddie , you 've got to help us . There 's been a major energetic shift . We 're all in great danger . - I think that the world ... our world is about to end as we know it . I 'm seeing signs . - I don 't care . What is that ? - Maddie , no . it 's ... it 's too dangerous . - Please , you 're the one who said I can 't be killed , right ? - Maddie , come on , we have to go , This place isn 't safe anymore . - God , shut up ! Edgar ! Deep ! Who are you ? Huh ? - I hate you , Maddie Carver ! You ruined me . - No ! Stop it , please ! Stop it ! - Maddie ! I 'm glad you made it . Come on , we don 't have much time . - What ? - We have to go , come on ! - What ? In an alley ? - Come on ! - Riley , where are we going ? - Just trust me , okay ? Come on . - Oh , that looks like a good movie . Okay , Riley , so what are we doing here ? - We are just about in time for the show . - I don 't want to see a movie . - You 'll want to see this . Come on ! - Glad you could make it . Here , you 'll want these . - Oh , no. is this 3D ? I hate 3D . So gimmicky and I get motion sickness . Oh . Peace up . Rock . I 've never seen glasses like these before . - Come on . - What are you guys doing here ? - We 're here for you , Maddie . Maddie ... What happened ? - Oh , jeez , what didn 't happen ? - What ? - How did you do that ? - I don 't know . - Wonderful , wonderful very entertaining . Thank you . - No hay banda . No hay banda ! Now move along . Your checks are waiting for you in the green room . Are you ready , Deep ? - Sorry folks . Give me a minute . - Roll the movie ! - I 'm trying . Technical difficulties . - Glasses on , everyone . - Want some ? - No , thanks . - Okay ... - I don 't see anything . - I have to go . I have to call my sister . - Hey , Riley ! - Hello ? - Hey , Beth . It 's Riley . - Hey , dad , did you eat yet ? No , please ! Please help me ! - What 's going on ? Edgar , what kind of movie is this ? - It 's the wrong film , that 's what . Deep , cut the projector ! Turn it off , now ! - You guys okay ? - Alright , I don 't know what 's going on , but Maddie , I 'm gonna take you home . - This will only work if you wear the glasses , Maddie . The only way that it 'll make sense is we all watch it together . - But what about Riley ? - I think we should stay . - Why ? - I ... I don 't feel any danger here . it 's just the past . The past can 't repeat itself , right ? - He 's right . - But our feelings about the past are real . - You 're right , too . - Seeing our past play out on the big screen is a bit disturbing Okay ? Especially when a lot of other people are watching what 's going on in our ... in our head But ... we need to figure out why things started changing , and I think this is the key . - Disturbing ? You want to talk about disturbing ? Okay ? That was my life and in just one second it all changed . - I think that 's the point . - Riley ! - She forgave me . She said I should let myself off the hook . I guess it was about time . So , what now ? - Good question . - Have a seat , Riley . I don 't think we 've seen the feature presentation yet . - Glasses , Maddie . Roll it , Deep ! - This is so cool . - Yeah I mean , what 's not to like ? Air-conditioning Fake sky ... Do you have any more gum ? - Uh-huh . - Thank you . - Where is Jess anyway ? - Hey , yeah , good point . - I really love how tiny and puny I feel underneath the sky . It 's like time stands still here , you know ? - You know , all the vast expense of space and time and I land in this shit hole . - Maddie Laughs . - Great ... - Thank you , thank you . Even though we know a great deal about our universe , there are hundreds , thousands , even millions of questions we can ask ourselves . Is there an end to the universe as it continues to expand ? Will it be possible to travel to planets light years from home ? What about black holes ? Worm holes ? Dark matter ? Is it possible they could be portals to another place altogether ? The universe has been our greatest mystery . Our greats unknown . We have our eyes , we see the moon , the sun , the stars , but our telescopes let us see light years deep into a wonder-filled universe . And what we see there is unimaginable . - Wow . This is ... I ... never knew this place was here. this really is something . - I know . I think it 's ... I think it 's really beautiful and romantic , you know ? - Hey , well , there 's fish inside . - Where ? - I just saw one right over there . Popped up . - There was one over there . - Aha ! I should probably ... uh have to get back right now ' cause my kids ... I want to give them a Chemistry pop quiz because they haven 't been doing their homework as they should . So ... - Yeah , sure , absolutely . - No , is that a date ? - No , it wasn 't a ... date . Was it ? I don 't remember . - We should come out here again , yeah ? - Ah , yeah , oh , sure ! Okay . - Uh ... is the car this way ? - Oh , no . It 's right over that way . - Okay . Would you like to have dinner on Friday night ? Toni ? - I would love to have dinner with you , Mark . - Totally a date . You are busted . Told you . - That was so awesome . - Uh-huh . - I love the planetarium . I mean it 's amazing how much you can actually learn like ... skipping school . - It 's also amazing how much of a dork you are . You 're the only person I know that skips school to go to a museum . - Ok ... well ... I mean you 're the only person who 's working at the commencement . - That was fun . - Yeah . Mark , what is that ? - This ? this is called a radiometer . that ... that tube in there is vacuum sealed - Huh .. - It responds to changes in temperature . Put your hand on it. it should respond to the temperature of your hand . - Okay ... - Maybe you 're cold-blooded . - Yeah ... - Actually , I think maybe the temperature 's the same . But ... uh ... scientists have a lot of different theories as to why it works , And no one 's exactly sure . It just ... it just does . - Oh , that 's ... uh ... that 's ... that is really geeky , Mark . - I ... I keep it around to remind myself that there are some things that even science can 't explain . - um-hm . Yeah , you should try psychology . - Oh , no . - Try to nail down human behavior . Or better yet , teenage human behavior . - No way . That 's impossible . - ( laughs } Yeah , yeah . It 's a pointless exercise . - Why did you choose that field again ? - Good question . - Oh , my god , you pig ! [ Maddie laughs ] You drank the whole thing ? You oinker . You could have saved me some . - I drank your milkshake . - Drink it up ! [ Maddie laughs ] ooh ... [ Maddie gasps ] Oh my God ! Oh ... It 's Riley . I should get that . - No . You know he 's just going to lecture you about cutting class . He 's such a choir boy sometimes . - I know , but ... - That 's it ? That 's the way you really feel about me ? - No , Riley . I didn 't mean it like that . I ... um ... don 't think I did . - I 'll just text him . I mean , we 're supposed to go to one of Fritz ' dumb parties anyways ? - Oh , wow , I love this song . I played this in ... uh ... college . - Really ? - Yeah . - Oh my God ! Hey ! What are you doing ? That is my recital piece . God ! You could mess it it up once in a while , you know ? You don 't always have to be so damn perfect ! What ? You don 't think I can play ? Oh . Okay . Okay . incomprehensible Aiyana ? Mr. Willis ? What are you doing here ? - Okay , I ... you and I neeed to go to the hospital . right now . - What ? Why ? - Uh , I 'm not entirely sure . - Okay ... uh .. well .how do we get there ? - I 'm not exactly sure about that either but I feel like this is what happens next . And if we 're lucky , I 'm gonna go outside and my car would have followed me here . I mean , Mr. Willis , this is totally unlikely . - Please . - Okay . Oh ... Still feeling likely , Mr. Willis ? - Not so much . - howdy folks . Welcome aboard . - Mr . Willis , you don 't look so good . - Bad headache . - There you are ! What took so long ? - Let 's just say we had technical difficulties . - We need to go , now . - Where 's Riley ? Isn 't he supposed to be here , too ? - He just left right after the movie . He seemed a little upset . - Yeah , that . - Mark ? What 's wrong , are you okay ? - My head ! - Alright , we 're gonna get you some help , come on . Maddie , stay right here . When we get back , we 'll figure this whole thing out . - What did you say her name was ? - Jess , Jess Selvy . We have to use the eye drops to keep her eyes moistened around the clock . She won 't blink . - You can 't just shut her eyes ? - We tried that , but they pop back open every time . - Is it a coma ? - If it is a coma , It 's the damnedest thing I 've ever witnessed . the corpus callosum is severed , but there 's still brain activity . Docs say there 's a chance , but ... I think it 'll take a miracle . - Jess ? Jess , it 's me , Maddie . What 's going on ? Hey ! Is anyone there ? Hello ? - Yeah . She 's fine . - Doctor , what the hell are you doing ? - How are our reflexes ? - Looks like they 're pretty good , bro . - Where am I ? - You 're in her lair . - Her lair ? Whose lair ? What are you talking about ? - You 'll see . - Untie me ! - We need to get her permission . - Permission ? And who do you need permission from ? Your mommies ? - She 's coming ! - What ? Who 's coming ? Hey ! Jess . What ? - Prepare for the sacrifice . - What ? - Jess ... We don 't know what that will do . - Arigato . - Jess ... I think you need to chill out , okay ? - In this world , I know Japanese . In this world , I am somebody . I even got control of these two douche bag who tried to push me around . - Jess , you were never a nobody . - Yes ! I was always second string to people like you . And then something happened . I became powerful . I became important . I became somebody ! - Jess ... This isn 't real , okay ? This is a dream . You ... you 're dreaming or I 'm dreaming or we 're both dreaming the same dream at the same time . - This doesn 't feel like a dream , does it ? - No ... It 's some kind of time spacial thing . That 's what we 've come up with . - We ? - Mr . Willis and I. - Um ... He 's so hot . In a smart kind of way . - Jess , come on . We have to figure this out . So things could go back to normal . - What are you talking about ? I 'll tell you the reason why you want things back . In your world , you 're little Miss Perfect . Everyone likes you . I 'll be back to being a supporting character in the cast . A nobody ! - Jess , you were never a nobody . You are my best friend . - It was all we could find . Oh brother . Okay . Let 's do this . - Jess , come on , no ! - It 's for the best , Maddie . It will be like you never existed . Maddie ! - Happy to see us ? - Yeah ! - Surprise . - Riley ! - He 's one of us now . - I 'm self aware . You 'll have to accept me the way I am from here on out . - Good , I 'm glad . So ... now what ? - Well , we 're are going back . But this time we 'll be all together , I promise . No harm is gonna come to you . - Not the freaky theater again ... - No , that 's already been dissolved in another realm . We 've got something else in mind . - Oh , what is this ? Some kind of instant replay ? - Maddie , this isn 't a movie . We have to face reality . - Reality ? Have you seen what 's been going on ? - Edgar , we got to go . - W ... wait . I thought you guys said we were all in this together . - Don 't worry. you 'll see us again soon . - Come on , you need to see this . - Yeah , I 've heard that one before . Riley , I don 't think I can do this . - It 's gonna be okay . I won 't let anything happen to you this time . Come on . - Hi , guys . What are you doing here ? What 's with the outfits ? - Ma 'am ? It 's Maddie . - Unit 57 responding . Take care , Jess . - You 're in our thoughts . - Edgar ... - You rest easy , Darling . We 'll come back and check on you later . - Deep ? - I 'm sorry . - Oh , Jess ... Tell me this is a hallucination . Tell me this isn 't real . - No , Maddie , this is the truth . - No . - You need to accept the truth . - No , I don 't ! I do not like this truth , Riley ! She 's my best friend . - I can 't believe it 's been almost a month . - Yeah , me neither . You 're gonna see her this weekend ? - Yeah , I see her every weekend . - Do you think she knows you 're there ? - I don 't know . I think so . What about you ? Well ? - I don 't know . I hate hospitals . - You are such a coward . - Jess . - No , you said you were in love with her . - Alright ! I 'm a coward . I can 't stand to see her that way . - You mean it grosses you out , right ? - Because she 's not pretty anymore with a big chunk of metal stuck in her skull ? - Jess , she 's a vegetable ! She 's not Maddie anymore . - She 's breathing on her own . God ! Shit ! Ah ! - Jess , are you alright ? - Uh ... it was just like a ... sharp pain , but it ... it 's gone now . - If you need to go to the nurse let me know , alright ? - I 'm okay . - Alright . - Hey Jess ... Are you sure you 're okay ? Jess ... [ Maddie Laughs ] What has gotten into you ? - I don 't know . - Nuggets . - What ? - Nuggets ? We 're ... having chicken nuggets for lunch . - Miss Carver , is there something you want to share with the rest of the class ? - No . - Then I suggest you get back to work . - Ugh . disgusting . I don 't know why you like them . Have the rest of mine . Uh ... hello ? Jess ! What 's up ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . - What have you been doing this past month ? I mean , things have changed This isn 't how it 's supposed to be . Don 't you remember anything ? I mean ... the planetarium ? The crash ? - The crash ? What are you talking about ? - Remember we skipped school and we went to the planetarium ? Right ? And on the way back , we got into a crash . You 've been in the hospital for the last month with a big chunk of metal lodged into your skull ! - Okay ... okay ... Maybe you 're the one who should go to the hospital . Or you ... you could see Miss Carloftis . - Thanks , miss . I appreciate it . - We should really take better care of this place . - Hey , Jess ! Come ride with us ! - What 's her problem ? - I don 't know . Seeing dead people or something today . - Hey , Jess ! Let 's just go . - Hello ? - Maddie ! Maddie ! - Riley , what the hell was that ? You promised me the truth . - The truth is there . You 're blocking it . - So this is my fault ? I don 't think so . - We need to go back in there , Maddie . - No , you go back in there , I 'm done . Where 's Mr. Willis and Miss Carloftis ? - I 'll take you to them . - Maddie ... Are you okay ? What happened ? Where did you go ? We were looking all over for you . - You don 't wanna know . You just want to drug-test me again . - I deserve that . I 'm sorry . I didn 't understand . And you 're right . A lot of spooky things have happened . - Spooky actually at a distance . - Excuse me ? - Quantum entanglement . - Huh ? - Two electrons in two different locations establish a telepathic link to each other that transcends space and time . Einstein called it spooky action at a distance . I think we are in some kind of quantum entanglement a realm that can 't be explained by cause and effect . whe ... where ... where the laws of linear time no longer seem to apply . But I think it all began with you and Jess and that car accident . - Are you calling Jess and I electrons ? - Yeah , yes , sort of . Yes . Quantum mechanics is ... is is really a model for studying particle behavior , not human behavior , but think about it . What if we tool the same quantum principles and applied it to a trillion trillion electrons ? - Alright , everybody , I got this thing fixed . The show 's about to begin . - No , no , no . Not another movie . - Don 't worry Maddie . This system is fully digital . state-of - the-art stuff , ultra high-definition . - No glasses this time ? - No glasses either , Mr. Willis . We 're gonna pick up exactly where we left off . Action . - Oh , my God ! - Why can 't we remember any of this ? - This is totally backwards . How can a movie be more real than our real lives ? - It 's like Edgar told you the first time , Maddie ... you 're a thought . A figment , a memory . Memories are like movies , just fragments that our brain puts together to build a story . It can be a good story or a bad story . - Yeah well , I still don 't understand . - We 're all stuck in a ... a memory loop that Jess ' head injury Her thoughts are turning into our reality . Hector and Deep explained it all before we left . - Okay , so how do we get unstuck ? - I didn 't explain that part . - Great . - It 's like I 've been saying . A very , very deep level . You and Jess are communicating about what happened . - Oh , no . Not that again . What ... what if science could explain human behavior at ... at ... at ... a sub atomic level ? It 's like why I keep hearing violins , right ? It 's like a frequency or membrane that somehow connects the past to the present , and then it 's pulled all of us here together . Yeah . Tell me this . Do weird things seem to happen to you when you rehearse or play the violin ? - Maybe sometimes . But what are you saying ? If I quit the violin , then things will go back to normal ? - No , no , no ... - No , that 's not what Mr. Willis is saying , but I do think that Mark is on to something . Love and hate . What are the only two human energies that can transcend space and time . - I 'm lost . - Okay . How is it that a mother can know intuitively when her child has passed ? Even if they are thousands of miles away ? Love . You know ? It 's the only thing that can transcend generation , space , time ... It 's like being tuned into the same frequency same channel , just as Mark said . Entire empires kill each other off because they stay stuck in stories about the past . They stay stuck in the same channel . Like you and Jess are stuck in the cycle of blame and guilt . - So ... Jess hates me because of the accident ? - It 's the only explanation for why we all stuck in this cycle spider-web . The only way out is to change Jess ' thinking at a very deep level . - Exactly . Change the frequency . Like changing the channel . - You guys don 't get it ! She 's never gonna forgive me ! I ruined her life ! I worse than ruined her life . - You have to see Jess . And I 'll go with you . You don 't have to be afraid . - No , no . I can 't do this anymore . - Maddie . - Come on ! Hey Jess ... What 's with the outfit ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry ! I ... I would do anything to trade places with you . Hey . - How was it ? - It 's okay . You know , Jess wouldn 't have missed this for the world . - Thank you . - Ah , hi ! Hi Maddie , Riley . - Thank you guys for coming . I really appreciate it . it 's nice to have familiar faces in the audience . Especially if I screw it up . - Don 't say that . You 're gonna be great . - You 're gonna be fantastic . I 'm gonna see you guys after , right ? - Of course ... - Absolutely . - Okay ... Aiyana , you scared me . That 's a really great outfit . I 'm glad you 're here . I probably should have done this yesterday . Think this is too much rosin ? - Hi , Maddie . You ready ? - Yeah , ready as I 'll ever be , I guess . - How 's your hand ? - It 's good . it 's good . It still aches a little bit . But I can still play , so ... - I 'm really proud of you for going through with this recital . You know , after all you 've been through , it shows real character . - Thank you . - And my condolences I 'm sorry about your friend . Oh , how 's the new violin working out for you ? - It 's good . The tone is a little bit brighter than I 'm used to , but I think I like it . And I sound a little bit more like Aiyana . - Uh ... good . Aiyana ? - Aiyana ! - Oh , listen , they 're announcing you . Better get ready . Break a leg . - Thanks . See you out there . Well , I guess that 's me . - There 's an exhibit at the science museum . Do you want to go ? - You know , I have a better idea . There 's a poetry reading downtown . You want to go to that instead ? - Only if you 'll let me drive this time . - Deal . Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha

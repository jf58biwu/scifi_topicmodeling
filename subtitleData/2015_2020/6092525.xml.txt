 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I need to control this or stop it . Otherwise , I don 't know what happens to me . You weren 't stopping your powers , Skye . You were ... directing them inward . I 'm recommending Skye leave S.H.I.E.L.D. altogether . No , I know you 're keeping something from me . Bobbi and I work for an organization that came out of the wreckage from what Fury left . Who the hell are you working for ? The real S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent 33. she was wearing a nanomask , disguised as May , but May electrocuted her right in the face . Never turn your back on the enemy . - Whitehall 's dead . - So you 're free . - I don 't know what to do . - I can get us out of here . Then we 'll figure it all out . 2x14 - " Love in the Time of Hydra " You like fried chicken ? Ours is the best in the county . Oh , I-I 'm not sure . I ... I guess I need another minute . Of course . And what about you , handsome ? Think I 'll try the pumpkin pancakes . Ooh . Good choice . How about I grab you some pecan syrup while your friend makes up her mind ? Hmm . Pumpkin pancakes . For dinner ? Did you not hear what she said about the pecan syrup ? Well , you are just full of surprises . Hey , I tried being the meat-and-potatoes guy . Well , I didn 't know that guy , but ... The guy sitting across from me isn 't so bad . Says the girl who saved my ass back in Puerto Rico , - nursed me back to health ... - Well , what else was I going to do ? After Whitehall was killed , I was ... just ... lost . Then I guess we 're both lucky you found me . Looks like we 're a go . I was really looking forward to those pancakes . All right ! Everybody on the ground now ! Do as she says , and nobody gets hurt . Don 't worry , Rhonda . Everything 's gonna be just fine . - Even left you a tip . - You . Get up . Please , just take it . There 's over $ 200 in there . Put that away . You 're coming with us . Why ? You 're gonna fix my face . Well , the bruising has started to fade , though I 'm afraid these stress fractures - will require a bit more time to heal . - Great . Tried to go zen to keep my powers in check only to find myself ... aah ... back on the D.L. The " down low " ? - The " disabled list . " - Oh . Oh , yeah . That makes more sense . Yeah , and now I 'm all ... You know , it could just be growing pains ... from the new powers . It 's okay , Fitz . You don 't have to put a positive spin on this . I 'm not doing that . I would never patronize the ... Well , the ... things change . That 's what I 'm saying . So maybe if you can learn to control this , then ... you could have avengers-level powers , something like Captain America , even . I think it best we keep in mind the unstable nature of Skye 's power . If there is an Avenger equivalent , right now I 'm afraid it 's the Hulk . Well , Hulk saved the world , last I checked . You 're absolutely right . But given the choice , I believe Bruce Banner would not hesitate to cure himself once and for all . Well , then ... I guess we should be thankful - that nobody 's given him the choice . - Oh , Fitz ... Don 't " oh , Fitz " me . I 'm be ... - I 'm sorry , Skye . - This really isn 't about you . I 'm pretty sure it is . I 'll go back to the cage . Andrew 's recommending Skye be removed from S.H.I.E.L.D. , effective immediately . I agree with his recommendation . I 've got to admit ... I 'm surprised to hear you say that . I can agree with my ex . Skye 's too dangerous to be out there right now . - You just brought her into the field . - I had no other choice . You were in danger . I made a call . And Skye 's injuries were something ... neither of us saw coming . - What won 't we see next time ? - Hard to say . Which is why you need to remove Skye from the equation . I know it 's difficult , Phil . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s always wrestled with how to handle people who are enhanced . And add Skye 's alien DNA to the mix , it 's a whole new category we have to deal with . This isn 't about categories on the index , May . - We 're talking about Skye . - And as her S.O. , I am telling you , I have no idea how to handle her . You 'll find a way . You always do . - Not always . - This isn 't Bahrain . Okay ? We know who we 're dealing with here . Don 't fool yourself . Skye 's changed . Maybe not on the surface , but inside . She doesn 't know herself anymore . I want you to blink twice for me . Did the facial-scan diagnostic appear ? - Yes . - Now close your eyes for two seconds , and the change should take effect . Hmm . That reminds me of my Berkeley days . Well , the effect would be far more convincing if you were to replicate the face of another woman . And don 't forget ... I stabilized your vocal processor . Admittedly , it 's not quite as precise as my original nanomask . But regardless , I think you 're going to find it extremely useful for any on-the-go S.H.I.E.L.D or Hydra operations ? I see you figured out how to reset the mask . Just remember the program 's memory can only store up to three facial scans at a time . And you 're sure there 's no way to remove the mask ? There 's nothing I can do . But if you want your old face , - just turn the machine off ... - No ! You 've seen what 's underneath . Please , I know this is difficult . But look at the bright side ... now you can be anyone you want . Maybe you can find an old photo from before the accident . Use that for the facial scan . - Let the mask do the rest . - Not sure where I 'd find one . To be honest , I haven 't even seen her face . Oh . I see . Well , then I guess it 's fair to say we all hide our true selves , don 't we ? Or we just ... wait for the right time to reveal the truth . So this is what all the fuss is about ... another S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Lower your voice . It 'll all get worked out momentarily . Lower my voice ? You must be joking . So , where now ? To see the wizard ? Eh , something like that . Priceless . I guess one boss wasn 't enough for you and Bobbi . Seems the road trip hasn 't dampened your friend 's spirits . Gonzalez . It 's good to see you , sir . - It 's been too long , Mack . - Yeah . It 's good to have you back on board . - You must be Lance Hunter . - And you must be crazy . I assure you , none of us wanted this . I think I preferred you acting alone instead of taking orders from the clown academy . This is not about blindly following orders , Mr. Hunter . This is about leaders being held accountable . To the men and women they serve , as well as those that govern alongside them . Thanks for the democracy lesson , Lady Thomas Jefferson . But if it 's all the same , spare me the sales pitch . That 's great . We should throw him in the brig . Let 's not be hasty , Tom√°s . We at least owe him an explanation . We founded S.H.I.E.L.D ... the real S.H.I.E.L.D ... on the belief that leadership should operate with transparency and not from the shadows . Nick Fury simply kept too many secrets . Got it . Couldn 't agree more , actually . Just one little detail that you seem to have overlooked in your otherwise spot-on assessment . Guy with the eye patch and the secrets , Nick Fury ... he 's dead . Fury is dead , but Coulson 's alive and well . Thanks to one of those secrets . And it seems that instead of learning from those mistakes , Coulson 's heading down the same path . All right . So that 's what this is about . You guys don 't want Coulson in charge . I 'll be the first to admit the guy 's not perfect . Sometimes chews with his mouth open , tends to hog the mike on karaoke nights . But other than that , he 's not so bad , really . Well , I 'm afraid we don 't share that opinion . This is rubbish . Maybe you 've drunk the conspiracy kool-aid , but there 's not a chance in hell Bobbi would ever bow down to any of this ... Perhaps we could have discussed this alone ... - without all of hufflepuff looking on . - Hunter ... please . Okay , then . - Indoctrinate away . - It may come as a surprise to you , but I was very close to Isabelle Hartley . You see , she saved my life in this very facility . Hydra had me dead to rights . You 're not the first person Izzy helped out of a pinch . But I may have been the last . By all accounts , Isabelle 's death could have been avoided if Agent Coulson hadn 't been so relentless in his pursuit of alien tech . Added to that , the tragedy in Puerto Rico ... the death of Agent Triplett , the transformation of the young woman , Raina . Even Agent Skye seems to have been affected . And all because of Coulson 's search for a city that his own alien writing drove him to find . Yeah , he 's put all that scribbling behind him . Oh . Should we all just get up and go home now ? This is not a decision that we arrived at lightly . I know Coulson . He was a good agent . At least , he was before Fury injected him with alien DNA . Ever since , his behavior 's grown increasingly more troubling . Can you honestly tell me that you don 't share any of these concerns ? I won 't deny you have a few good points . But why not just take it up with the man himself ? We wanted all the facts first . Which is what Bobbi and I have been doing ... gathering intel . Bobbi , you 're an awfully quiet member of this coup d 'etat . What 's your take ? I believe they 're right . Coulson has been compromised . Come in . - It 's all there ? - Yes , sir . Is there something else ? It 's just ... possible repercussions . We 've been over this , Agent Simmons , and I 'm aware of the consequences , - but this is my decision to make . - Yes , sir . Ah . No . - Ankle bone 's always the toughest . - Yeah . Maybe a game of nerves isn 't the best idea for me . - You and I need to take a ride . - Okay . But why am I suddenly feeling like old yeller right now ? Kind of surprised you know the reference . I 've had a lot of downtime lately . That and Fitz really wants a dog . - Thought he wanted a monkey . - Guess he readjusted his expectations . You can 't tell me where we 're going , can you ? You 're gonna want to pack a bag . So ... Everything all right ? Uh , yeah , I 'm just deciding on what to wear . Why don 't you let me take care of that ? - Where you going ? - Pick up another surprise for you . But wait . We just finished with the doctor . It was important he not talk . - Now it 's time for the next phase . - Wait . I appreciate what you 're doing , really . But you have to stop . I 'm too , um ... I-it 's just ... I have nothing to give to you in return . That 's not why I 'm doing this . Just be patient . I 'll be back in a couple of hours . I 'm sorry about everything that 's happening , Skye . Not your fault . The blame begins and ends with my dad . Well , you wouldn 't be the first person to have parents with misguided intentions . Nope , just the first whose crazy dad lured her to an alien city to get earthquake powers . Yeah . I got us a little something for the trip . Thing I remember most about my dad is he was a car guy . Always working on this junker he insisted I help him fix . While my friends were outside , playing ball , having fun , there I was , stuck at home with him , fixing that damn car . Wasn 't till we finished that it hit me . That car was the most beautiful thing I 'd ever seen . And all the time we 'd spent together working on it gave me an appreciation I never would have had otherwise . Hold on . Was that car a red 1962 Corvette ? Yeah . Well , he 'd be very proud . Your red Corvette flies . How cool is that ? It 's pretty cool . But I think the thing he 'd like most about it ... at her core , she 's still just a red ' 62 Corvette . Just to be clear , I-I 'm the Corvette in this story . Right ? Now you want to tell me where we 're going ? We 're almost there . Have a seat . I 'll be right in . Pumpkin pancakes . When you left , it got me thinking ... what do I have to offer that you would even want ? Hmm . Surprise . Wait . What are you doing ? I 'm giving you what you want . - You 're wrong . - We both know that 's not true . You took Skye off that S.H.I.E.L.D. plane for a reason . - I made her a promise . - You don 't have to pretend . I saw the way you looked at her . And you also picked me up from the floor after she shot me . Whatever I may have thought there was between me and Skye , she made it pretty clear the feeling wasn 't mutual . - I 'm not insane . - Uh , I 'm ... sorry . Please , you have to forgive me . This is so stupid . It 's okay . I ... I ju ... I thought that if ... I looked like her , then maybe ... maybe there 's a chance we could be together . Well , maybe we could . But not as Skye or May . No . It has to be with you . - Me ? - Yeah . There is no me . Whoever I was before is destroyed ! Whitehall wiped her all away . Mack . How 's your cover with Coulson ? We 're giving him updates once a day , painting in broad strokes . Heartbroken ex-husband , finding comfort in a bottle , - that kind of thing . - It 's time for you to get back , then . - Okay . - Play it as ships passing in the night . Roger that . - What 's your take on Hunter ? - It 's hard to say . He 's not really the type to show his cards , - especially in front of an audience . - Would you tell me if he was ? What are you implying , Robert ? I know that you and Hunter have been reconnecting lately . Maybe that 's taken your focus off the big picture . You really want to play that angle , after the hell you and I have been through here together ? I need to make sure that you 're all-in , Barbara . - I 'm all-in . - Good . Then you 'll understand why we 're keeping Hunter on the base till the Coulson situation has been resolved . I know what 're you going through ... my family did a number on me ... stripped me down , left me ... hollow . I was a shell . So , when someone finally did come along and offer to build me back up , I didn 't resist ... Even though what he really did was make me a killer . But you seem so well-adjusted . It was a long road . Took getting locked up to give me some perspective . But then I paid my family a visit . They were surprised to see me , but I think that eventually , we were able to ... dig in , really ... express our feelings . That 's it ? I haven 't looked back since . You are the only one who can find yourself . But maybe this will help . - What is it ? - Closure . Sunil Bakshi ? He 's in Air Force custody under a guy named Talbot . I was thinking you and I should drop by and say hello . Bakshi was the one who dragged me from my safe house , prepped me for Whitehall . Which is why you need a face-to-face ... to get all this out . Let him know how you really feel . I ... I-I ... I 'm sorry . I just ... I can 't ... No . Hey . It 's okay . We 'll do this together . I 'll be there every step of the way . Okay . - Okay . - But how ? You said he 's in Air Force custody . Got that all worked out . First you ... are gonna need this . I could have swore it was in here somewhere . Unless maybe I put it in my other purse . Is everything okay , Mrs. Talbot ? Well , obviously not . I can 't find my I.D. anywhere . It 's not that , ma 'am . It sounds like you have a cold . Can 't seem to shake the damn thing . Probably got it from my son , the little germ factory . How about I just call the general , get this all straightened out ? The thing about a riding mower is it gives you a superior cut , lets you control the terrain . - That 's very informative , sir . - Ah . You got two hands , four wheels ... one saddle . That 's really what it 's all about , lieutenant . General Talbot 's office . I see . It 's security . Your wife left her I.D. at home again . It 's a little early for taco Tuesday , isn 't it ? All right . Send her up . Yes , ma 'am . Sorry about the wait , Mrs. Talbot . You 're all set . - I hope you feel better . - Thank you . It 's one of Fury 's old retreats . Haven 't been in here in years . Fury 's not the kind of guy who has a cabin just to relax . What is this place ? It 's a safe house for people with powers . Rogers even spent a few weeks here after he defrosted . Okay , but who 's it supposed to keep safe ... the people with powers or everyone else ? Both . Skye , I 'm afraid I have to pull you from active duty . I get it . I do . I just didn 't think that you 'd lock me up - like a werewolf during full moon . - You 're not alone here . - Feels pretty isolated to me . - There 's a direct video link to the base , and May will keep dropping by every couple of days . What am I supposed to do ? Go fishing ? Well , if you do go outside , be careful . There 's a laser fence around the perimeter . Look , this is a safe place . You can relax here . You can use this time to get a handle on your abilities . Yeah , ' cause that 's worked great so far . Well , maybe it 's time we give you a hand with that . Simmons has been working around the clock on these . She assures me they 'll cut your recovery time in half . How to they work ? The internal wiring emits a surge of electricity - to inhibit your powers . - So these take my powers away ? More like decrease their magnitude to keep you from hurting yourself . - Like I said , we want you to heal . - Seems like a no-brainer . It 's a personal call . What do you mean ? Are there side effects ? A few . Simmons can go over them with you later . Are these gloves really my best option ? I can 't answer that question for you , Skye . Stop . Stop being this S.H.I.E.L.D. guy for just one second , okay ? Please . We 've been through way too much together . I just need you to be my friend right now . What would you do if you were me ? I don 't know . These are uncharted waters , but if anybody can find a way through them , it 's you . 'Cause I 'm the red Corvette . Because you 're one of the few people I know I can trust . Do something to your hair , major ? Looks good . - What the hell ? - Feed go out ? Yeah , and I can 't figure out why . Any ideas ? Might know a little something . Hey , honey . Get lost on the way to my office ? No , I 'm not lost . I 'm just stuck in some traffic . Wait , you 're telling me you 're still in the car ? Yes . I swear , this construction on 5th - has been going on forever . - But I just s ... She 's not really here . - Excuse me , sir ? - I need you to lock down the base for me right now , lieutenant . And if you see me someplace I 'm not supposed to be , I 'm not there . It 's that damn mask again . Get to the sat room . Make contact with Phil Coulson . Tell him the nanomask is in play . No one comes in here without my permission . No one . Is that everybody ? All female personnel are accounted for , sir . Outstanding . At ease . We have a situation . There is a mole on our base . This mole infiltrated security by posing as my wife and could be anyone in this room right now . Make no mistake ... this is an enemy combatant , one not to be taken lightly . But rest assured , I will find this perpetrator . Because if there is one thing that I cannot stand , - it is a spy in my house . - Mack . - You want to tell me what 's going on ? - Excuse me ? You 've been off-campus several days babysitting Hunter . - Yet here you are . - What ? Oh , and still no Hunter , yeah . Well , I mean , what can I say ? I spent the last 48 hours in Athens , Georgia , keeping the guy out of bar fights . I mean , the guy 's in no shape to return . - Well , then we 've got a problem . - I 'm not sure I 'm seeing it . Hunter didn 't resign or take a leave of absence . He went AWOL . Yeah , a broken heart will make a guy do dumb things . - So will money and opportunity . - Oh . No , uh ... What , you think Hunter ... might sell S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets ? No , no , trust me ... the only threat this guy poses is to himself . - Bobbi there when you left ? - No , I didn 't see her . Two ships pass in the night , I suppose . Call Coulson . He 's waiting for your report . Will do . Is there anything else ? Uh ... No . You 've done enough already . Okay . - Thanks for the update , Mack . - Is everything okay ? - I 'm afraid I have to get back . - I get it . Didn 't expect you to stay and roast marshmallows . This is temporary , Skye . I 'll be back in a couple days . - If you need anything ... - I 'll let you know . We 'll figure this out . I promise . Captain Andersen . I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy . - I don 't have a daughter , sir . - No , you do not . Lieutenant ... when was the last time I got your name right ? - Never . Sir . - You are correct . I think we have a winner , folks . This is not your face . General , please ... Sorry about that , Meredith . Damn it ! Where is she ? ! - Uniform 's a little big . - Shortest guy I could find . Any luck with security clearance ? Come on . Follow me . What is it you want ? Agent 33 . Loyal to the very end . - What are you doing here ? - Just lending a hand . - Whose orders are you following ? - My own . Agent 33 , you need to listen to me very carefully . You 've lost your way . Take a deep breath . Calm your mind ... and your compliance will be ... Seems they all check out . Then who the hell was that masquerading as my wife ? Uh , sir ... - Hi , honey . - Stop right there ! Th-The guard wasn 't at the front , so I just walked in . - Get down ! - Glenn , you 're scaring me . - Now ! - Okay . Put your face on the carpet ! Okay ! God ! What is wrong with you ? ! God , I-I-I even brought those little pork taquitos that you like so much . Honey ... Carla ? - I 'm sorry . - You could have just told me , Bob . I was hoping to keep you out of this . You 're right . I totally blew that one . I gave your name to Coulson because Hartley needed backup . I never thought you 'd stay , let alone care . Then you started asking questions about what Mack and I were up to . And the next thing I know , he has you tied up in his trunk . - Least fun road trip of my life . - Forgetting Arizona ? More like repressing the memory . Still can 't listen to the eagles without getting the chills . I should have known it wouldn 't work out between us . I mean , we first hit it off when you were sent to steal intel from me . - Well , I made it worth your while . - Time of my life , really . But maybe not the bedrock foundation upon which a marriage is built . Everything I felt for you ... that was real . Yeah , maybe so . But in the end , you still got that intel , didn 't you . Hunter ... It 's always the same pattern , love . I fall for you , only to discover you got something else up and running . - There was no hidden agenda with you . - Yeah , you say things like that , but your actions clearly suggest otherwise . Can 't you just meet me halfway ? - I want to . Just tell me how . - Walk away . Right now . You and I ... we can leave all this mess behind , just start over , be new people , be better people . I 'm sorry . I need to finish this . Fine . Well , I 'm leaving , Bob . - So don 't try and stop me . - I won 't . Everybody else will . There 's nowhere to go ! Damn it , Hunter . Bloody hell . - Sir . Where 's Skye ? - I 'm afraid that 's confidential . 'Cause you 're keeping her prisoner somewhere , aren 't you ? Skye is safe , Agent Fitz . That 's all you need to know . You took something up to Coulson earlier . - What was it ? - It was nothing . Didn 't look like nothing . - What was in the case , Jemma ? - Something to help Skye . Because you want to change her . Is that it ? Stop it . I don 't want to change Skye . The Diviner did that . I 'm just trying to fix her ! You never used to be this scared . You know that ? Trip died , Fitz , all because we didn 't take the necessary precautions . No , it 's not that . You 're afraid . 'Cause of what happened to me and Skye , how we both changed . Well , you know what the scariest change is , Jemma ? It 's you . Agent 33 infiltrated your base to break out Sunil Bakshi ? Turns out she wasn 't working alone , either . We managed to track down video of the vehicle leaving the premises . Guess who was behind the wheel . Grant Ward . Agent 33 must have dragged him out of Puerto Rico . Guessing we haven 't heard the last of this . Your wife ... how 's she holding up ? Rattled , which is to be expected . Damn experience nearly cost me my marriage . I 'm gonna be up to my ears in edible arrangements trying to make this thing right . I lost two men to those psychopaths . Good men . My condolences . It 's never easy . Just tell me we 'll get those sons of bitches , Coulson . You have my word , general . All right , then . I 'll be in touch . - It 's a lot to process . - Throw it on the heap . - Everything all right , Phil ? - Earlier today , with Skye ... - just didn 't feel right . - You made the right call . There 's just too many things in play right now - for her to be here . - Yeah , maybe . But you ever get that feeling ... like you mishandled something important ? Yeah . It 's how I felt after leaving Andrew . So , Mack ... you believe him ? - Nope . - Me , neither . Guess it 's time we find out what he 's up to . Hey , it 's me . Something happened with Skye . I think we have a situation . It appears Hunter escaped using one of the ship 's submersible pods . We 've managed to scramble communications , - but he 's disabled the GPS . - So we don 't know where he is . Or where he 's going . Once he reaches shore , he 's a free man , able to communicate with whomever he pleases . We approximate 12 hours till he reaches the coast . We may have a bigger problem . I just got off the phone with Mack . - Seems Coulson 's put Skye in hiding . - Stockpiling enhanced people ? I doubt that . Skye and Coulson ... they 're close . She 's more than just some asset to him . So says the person whose ex-husband just flew the coop . - Agent Calderon ... - Oh , come on . We all know Bobbi could have taken out that tea cup - anytime she wanted ... - I might just have to test - that theory out on your face . - Enough . Bobbi gave me her word she 's still committed , and I have no reason to doubt her . This is your op , Morse , so tell me ... how do you want to proceed ? Skye 's not the main concern . Coulson and his secrets ... that 's the threat . And I think it 's time that we remove that threat . - I want to go back in . - You gotta be crazy . You know that Hunter could blow your cover at any moment . And Weaver ? She gave you 12 hours . I only need six . Nice to finally meet you . I 'm Grant . Kara . I 'm proud of you , Kara . Thank you so much . You did this . And it is just the beginning . Guess that 's true . It 's going to be a long night . Guess we should get started , then . - You really think this 'll work ? - We 'll see . If I obey , will my compliance be rewarded ? To be honest , it really won 't make a difference .

 Here he comes ! Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you very much . Six commandos in here . I counted four in the hallway . That goon over there in the blue shirt . With all the scruff , looking around ? He was on Solace . He recognizes me , we got problems . Sir , is that really the President ? Well , if everyone in the bunker 's really dead , yeah , he was next in line . How are you ? Looks to me like he 's playing a part . His body language , expression , the way the two guys are up against him . Nice to meet you . He 's being held against his will . If they have him , and they can somehow piece the country together , get communications up , they 'll control everything - - the federal reserve , the military . Well , that 's not gonna happen . Thank you very much . One way or another , we 're getting our Commander in Chief out of here . Cover for me . - Need some help there , boss ? - Yeah , man . Thanks . What is this place anyway ? Lots of people , lots of mouths to feed . Yeah ? That 's a go for Tiger team . Sir , we 've got Tiger . Green , tell me the C.O. ' s standing with you . That 's a negative , sir . No contact or visual with Vulture team . I 'm on a rooftop 500 yards north of your whiskey , Tiger . - What 's your con ops ? - Well , sir , we are improvising . All seems quiet in the compound . C.O. most likely got in undetected . Yeah , or he walked in and they pointed a gun to his head . What 's our rally point , Taylor ? There 's a baseball field a half a mile north of my whiskey . At 30.275 north , 81.462 west . Copy , 30.275 north , 81.462 west , ball field . - Big enough to land our helo . - That 's the idea . Roger , out . Find that . Green , you 've got company . Signing off . All right , boys ! Stack the boxes on the dollies and roll ' em toward the side door . All right . I got that one . This goes to the scientist . Whatever you say . Impressive work , my friend . This is more than I expected . Ah , when the message is true , people are sure to follow . Take care . There 's still no contact with the sub . I 'm tellin ' ya , it 's that destroyer . It 's probably a problem with the repeater . Ian knows he 's not supposed to talk to us direct . Or maybe they 're under attack . Maybe he 's sunk . If he 's sunk , he 's sunk . Nothing we can do about it now . You can 't be serious . Nothing we can do about it now . Got it ? Okay , brother . I got it . Right . The boys saw a few stragglers in that last supply run . They 're living in a trailer park in the 1-1-5 . Niels has got a new magic trick he wants to try . You 're gonna go with him . Get in that van . Go on . Sir , the rally point is here , just north of jacksonville . We 'll be in range to launch our helo from here in about two hours depending on headwinds . Can 't launch from open water , not with the sub listening . You gotta find me a more protected spot . There 's the mouth of the St. John 's river . Uh , the land mass should be able to block our location if they try to ping us , but ... it 'll take an extra hour to get there , sir . O.O.D. , set a new course for the mouth of the St. John 's river . - O.O.D. , aye . Quiet one , sir ? - Yes . Helmsman , come left , steer course 3-2-5 . Activate prairie masker to conceal our frequencies . Hold at 12 knots . What are you doing over there ? Uh , chill out , man . Just ... Just taking a piss . - Well , get back to work . - You got it . Appreciate it . Thank you . Mighty grateful to you , sir . Pleasure to meet you . It is an honor and a pleasure . Thank you . - Thank you , sir . - It 's okay . Oh , my goodness . Look at the size of this guy , huh ? He 's a big kid . You are special , young man . You were chosen . Like all of us . Whatever we do , we need to do it fast . They 're moving the president tonight . - To New Orleans ? - Where 'd you hear that ? Guard at the courtyard . Tossed my hair a bit . He gave up the goods . - Any contact with Green and Taylor ? - Negative , sir . Those trucks are going on a supply run . They could be anywhere by now . As long as your friend doesn 't come back from the Solace and make you , my exfil plan could work - - if we separate POTUS from the guards . We need to move fast , and he may need some convincing . You were wrong about his body language . He 's not a hostage . He 's with them ? There 's layers in these groups . He may not know what the real agenda is . I don 't know how deep in he is , but he has drunk some of the kool-aid , that 's for sure . Well , we gotta do this quietly . If he 's here on his own will , that means he has power . If he has power , he can be manipulated . The repeater 's gone ? Destroyed , like a pile of chum . It had to be that ship . We should alert the brothers . If we rise up with no sound matting , we might as well paint a bloody target on the side of our sub . It 's gonna take days to fix the matting . We can 't just sit down here with our thumbs up our asses . Enough . We ain 't heard from that ship in hours , man . We gotta be far enough away . Just ' cause we ain 't heard ' em don 't mean they aren 't out there . And that makes you the blood expert , does it ? Yes , you - - Enough ! Bloody hell ! A bloke can 't even think with all this ruckus ! Shut it ! All of you ! Shut it ! You yellow-bellied , whiny wankers . I just ... I need ... To think . This machine is very impressive , Dr. Scott . Well , it 's really thanks to Commander Garnett and Lieutenant chung . I 've administered the virus to these four mice . And now ... it 's time to introduce them to the cure . And then ... We wait . So all they have to do is breathe it in ? Yes , all they have to do is breathe . It works very much like an inhaler . - Are you sure ? ‭ - It was him . He was experimenting on something . Jesus . I thought we smoked that mofo on the Vyerni . Well , he 's back from the dead . Hey , pompano ! Time to roll . - Load up . - Sweet . Where we goin ' ? A lot of people , a lot of mouths to feed . What 's with the motorcade ? I thought Sean wanted to keep this quiet . They don 't know what you 're up to , do they ? They 're here for the supply run . You 're just a pit stop on the way . Get in . Thank you . ‭ Mr. President . Nice to meet you . That your bag , ma 'am ? Is that your bag ? No . It 's been sitting there for about 20 minutes And I could swear I hear beeping coming from inside . Beeping ? Look , I don 't wanna be paranoid , but that 's the President , right ? I mean , should we say something ? Bomb ! There 's a bomb in here ! Oh , my God . The doors are locked ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! Get out of my way ! ‭ Get off of him ! Sir , get down . Get down ! Mr. President . - There was a bomb scare upstairs . - What ? It was just a knapsack . A woman panicked . - It was nothing . - It was not nothing . I could 've been trampled . Somebody in the crowd was able to get up right in my face . If he hadn 't stepped up and fought the guy off , who knows what would 've happened ? He certainly could 've got a shot off or stabbed me . So you brought him up here ? What 's he want ? A trophy ? Easy , James . Manners . Sean Ramsey . Course I know who you are . Well , thanks for your help . All right ? No disrespect ... But , uh , here in the U.S. of A. , we use more than two guys to guard the President . And we never leave his side . You 're right . Giovanni , you 're on Potus detail with these wankers . Make sure something like this never happens again . No , I want him . I want an American . You got a name ? Tommy . Where you from , Tommy ? Worked as a bodyguard in New York . I was protecting one of those teenage pop stars in Miami when the virus broke out . Next thing I know , people are dropping like flies , but I 'm still kicking . Wasn 't till I met one of your boys that ... I realized why . I was chosen . And your family ? Wife didn 't make it . So how 'd you come to us , then ? Just got in on a bus from down south . Must 've ran into Macdowell then . I was never really good with names . Man was a good speaker , though . You said you were chosen . I know I was . So that must mean that this is where you 're supposed to be at this very moment ? Well , I don 't know about that . But if I were in the right place at the right time , let the chips fall . The chips fall . Welcome to the team , brother . Tommy . You , stay close to him . You okay ? He didn 't have to break it . Don 't be a baby . Captain hasn 't left the suite . Think he pulled it off . Any word on Michener 's transport ? Still on schedule , according to my source . You and that guard seem to be getting along pretty well . Don 't get your hopes up . That was just an anesthetic . Niels . Can you believe that shit ? How did he hook up with these assholes ? What the hell do you think they 're up to ? I 'm not sure . But whatever it is , he 'll be spreading the virus . You think he might recognize us ? Nah , we saw him for what ? All of 20 seconds ? And he was inside a bubble . Well , you 're a lot less recognizable than me if it comes to that . ‭ I 'm just saying . I mean , you got that , um , vanilla thing . ‭ Look at me . Okay , whatever you say , Duck Dynasty . Yeah , I 'm a distinctive man . Bloody hell . We 've got a bearing on that American ship . It 's in firing range and getting closer . - They pinged us ? - No , not yet . - We ought to take the shot . - When we can 't move ? We can move . Without our sound matting ? We 'll be as bright as a friggin ' firecracker to them . I say we take the first shot right now . I like our chances . That 's what Sean would want , anyway . That 's what Ned would want . Course he don 't mind the idea of going to hell . I 've got another mind about that . They 're headed straight for our compound . I don 't think that 's an accident . Then take the bloody shot , then ! Take it ! Still 20 miles from the mouth of the river . Let 's hope we make it by the time the boys call for the extraction . And what if that sub 's parked off the coast waiting for us ? Cross that bridge when we come to it . I was thinking we should move Dr. Scott somewhere safe , somewhere off the ship . She won 't be any safer on land . You know what they did to Dr. Hunter and all the labs . They got people on the ground , Master Chief . Sounds like a whole lot of them . All over the place . We 're just one ship . " It is our responsibility as immunes " to restore this great nation . " And just as God chose Noah to survive the flood of The Old Testament . " He has chosen us to survive this plague that washed away the sins of our world . " Yes . Do I sound convincing ? Do you believe it ? Why , yes . Of course , But I don 't have Sean 's charisma . I watched his videos . I 've seen the translations into Spanish , Bulgarian . You don 't understand the language , but you believe what he 's saying . Bulgaria ? He has followers everywhere . I used to do " Meet the Press " every once in a while , but getting in front of crowds like this ... Sir ... I hope I 'm not out of line , but you look tired . Some fresh air might be good for you . I 'm sure we could clear the courtyard of the volunteers so you won 't have to worry about getting mobbed again . Right , fellas ? If that 's what he wants . Right . Excuse me . What 's all these ? What do you mean ? This is all that I 've made . We 're going to find more survivors , no ? No , no , no , no , no , you do one a day . And if that works , then we can talk about doing more . - Well , that 's not what Sean said . - Well , Sean ain 't here . Okay , fine , it 's not what Sean said , but ... all right . So remember , the gel , it soaks the fur , so as long as the bear is wet , it 's contagious . So really encourage the child to squeeze the bear . What the hell ? I 'm not doing your dirty work for ya . Then I can 't do it . I mean , if I breathe on them , they 'll get the virus anyway . It 's not a controlled experiment . We need to see if the bear works . I need a volunteer . Who likes kids ? Yeah , I 'll go . I 'll do it . Give it to him . What can I do for you , sir ? See that trailer park over there ? Go and , uh , go and hand it out to one of the kids . It , uh , squeaks . Kids enjoy that . Yeah , it 's our way of making ... friends in the community . You know , they may not be immune , but , uh , we got to be good neighbors . And , uh , you know , people are a bit skittish of strangers . So this will , uh , this will loosen ' em up . Yeah , sure . Jimmy , take Willie and go back him up . I don 't understand . The machine didn 't work ? No , the machine is not the problem . The mice closest to the porthole were able to inhale the vaccine immediately . So by the time the powder made its way to the second chamber , must 've lost its potency . Imagine dropping it from 300 feet . We 'll be lucky if anyone catches the therapeutic dose . It 'll be completely inactive by the time it reaches the ground . So what do we do ? I don 't know yet . Let 's go , everybody ! Over here . Over here . Sir ? We 're all set . Well , it doesn 't look like anyone 's here . I guess we should head back . That 's Sean 's little brother . - We do what he says . - Keep lookin ' . Help you with something ? I feel like we 've met . Not unless you 've been to Reno . No . I don 't know ... - Go ahead . - Where is this Reno , but ... We 've met before . You 're creeping me out , man . This is Cobra . I 've got eyes on C.O. He 's with three other men . Not sure who they are . But they 're on the move . How soon until you can launch the helo ? Still 6 miles out , sir . I don 't see anyone . You ? What are you waiting for ? Maybe you guys should stay back . We don 't wanna scare her . - All right . - Okay . The Vyerni . Yeah , that 's it . You know , I think Ned and his brother would be very interested to find out who you really are , huh ? Does he know who you are ? I bet his people won 't be very happy to find out that their whole belief system 's just a sham , That they ain 't chosen , and you 're just the lab rat that started all this . - They need me . - Yeah ? Yeah . More than they need to believe their own story ? Hi there . My name is Danny . What 's your name ? Laura . - Hi , Laura . - What 's that ? No , no , don 't come any closer . I need you to turn around and run away as fast as you can . - Why ? - Doesn 't matter . Just go . Go ! Okay , hold , hold - - whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! The virus is all over this thing ! That scientist is trying to poison innocent people - to weed out immunes . - We got our orders , friend . Look , you see this ? You see this ? What do you think this is ? What do you think that is ? ! - What is that ? - Believe me , these people are not who they pretend to be . Now put down your guns , save yourselves , - and get outta here ! - Sorry , we can 't do that , man . I suggest you stop talking . You 're making a mistake . What was that ? Uhh ! Aah ! - He 's not one of us ! - Hold up ! Hold up ! He 's from the ship ! He 's from the Nathan James ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Aah ! No ! No , no , no ! No . Get in ! Help . I 'm hit . Get in ! I got him ! I dropped that scumbag ! Starting our ascent to radio depth . Verify sonar with flight control . If you see anything , we dive immediately . Aye . Sir ? We 're picking up something on sonar . 3 nautical miles away , close to the surface . This one 's moving . That has to be our sub . Set quiet two and EMCON . Alert Tiger and Cobra . Bridge , it 's the X.O. Reduce speed to 4 knots . Can 't risk a fight now . We 've gotta get our people out of there . I 've got a bearing of 1-7-0 . Make ready ASROCs and stand by . Sir ? If they fire , we fire back . This is Tiger Team standing by rally point . Requesting immediate extract . Tiger ? Cobra . Ship 's at EMCON . Roger that . Any signs of the Captain ? Stop ! You ! Where are you going ? What 's the problem ? Mr. President , we need yo to come with us . - What the hell 's going on ? - We 're under attack . Some of our guys were picked off at the drop site . We have orders to evacuate the President . Get him back to the sub . Now ! Wait ! We go out that way , he 'll be mobbed . We need to take him out back . Secure the compound ! Lock it up ! Go , go , go ! Go , go ! You heard him ! Come on ! Hey ! Hey , what 's this alarm ? Maybe they made the captain . The courtyard 's blown . There 's half a dozen commandos out there . We gotta get to the kitchen . Come on . We need our helo in the air . Sir , we cannot launch the helo until we are into the mouth of the harbor . - How much further ? - Half a mile , Sir . At reduced speed , we 're still seven minutes away . Seal the exits ! There are people from that bloody ship inside here ! No one leaves this compound , you hear me ? I 've got it , I 'v got it ! No one leaves ! Stay inside ! No one leaves this compound ! Move it ! Move it ! Okay , you two , left ! Secure the President . Exfil point is blown . We can 't go out back . Who are you ? Mr. President , we don 't have much time . I 'm Commander Tom Chandler . We 're the United States Navy . Sean Ramsey is not who you think he is . He 's a terrorist threatening this country . We got to get you out of here right now . Sir ! With all due respect ... Let 's move . Quarter mile , Sir . 5 meters ... 3 meters ... 2 ... On radio depth . - Stop ! - What are you doing here ? No . We 've got the sub ! Ian , where the hell have you been ? That ship blew up our repeater . We 've got ' em in our sight . Stop them ! Ian , fire ! Blow that ship out of the water ! - Go active sonar ! - Aye . Tiger , Cobra ! This is Vulture ! What 's the extraction point ? I say again , what is the extraction point ? We got Vulture team , Sir ! Rally point 's at the baseball field a half a mile North-northeast your whiskey . See you in five . Gator ? ‭ Almost there . Sir , we 're being pinged . Asrocs armed and ready , Sir . 30 seconds till target . Weapons locked and loaded , mate . Prepare to fire ! Are we clear ? Gator ! 300 yards , Sir . 10 seconds to lock on . 200 . Gator ! Clear , sir ! I 've lost ' em . Lost ' em ? ! How the bloody hell did you lose ' em ? ! Get up ! Move ! Move ! Put the helo in the air . ASTAC T.A.O. Launch the helo . - Help . I 'm bleeding . - Apply pressure , dipshit . I 'll cut your heart out , you piece of shit ! I 'm dying . I 'm dying . Hey , don 't kill him . He could be useful . Here comes Vulture . - Where 's our ride ? - Unclear . Ship 's at EMCON . Where the hell did you find him ? Helo 's inbound . Secure L.Z. Perimeter . Let 's move ! Come on . Come on , you dirtbag . Green ! Move it ! Come on ! Move it ! Move it ! We got company ! Get in , dirtbag ! Come on ! Set ! Thought you and Dr. Scott might wanna have a chat with him ! Who 's that ? ! Jeffrey Michener , commander in chief ! Come again , boss ? ! He 's the President of the United States ! They 're taking Niels to the medical bay . Doc Rios says it 's gonna be a touch and go . And the infected toys , are you sure you destroyed them all ? Yes , sir . All but one . What 's this ? I think you better sit down . No , no , no , no , no ! How the hell could this happen ? You lost Niels ... you lost your President ... you almost lost me , brother . And for what ? For this stinking country with its filthy , ungrateful buggers . If we don 't attack now , that bloody ship is gonna kill every last one of us - You , me ... every man on our sub . Now what are you gonna do about it ? They 're organized , Mike , much more than you 'd imagine . Our country 's been without a leader for months now . It was only a matter of time before somebody like Ramsey to come along and try to take power . He 's got something . These people believe what he 's selling . You can 't do this to me ! You can 't - - You have no right to do this to me . No right ! You hear me ? ! Well , our Commander in Chief doesn 't seem too happy to be with us , does he ? Well , that 's something we 're gonna have to change . Won 't be easy ... if he really is one of them . This country needs a leader almost as much as it needs the cure . Ramsey was gonna use the President to win the hearts and minds of America . And that 's exactly what we 're gonna do .

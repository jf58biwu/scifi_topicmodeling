It wasn 't our fault . So you keep saying . Alright , there 's no point in arguing . There 's nothing we can do about it now . We do what we do best ... rob so .

Is there something we can do for you ? [ MAN laughing ] Is there something they can- - you hear that ? There was , definitely something you could do for me , your job . The one I set up for you ? The one you completely messed up ? This ringing any bells ? ! There were unforeseen circumstances . [ WOMAN ] Babe , have you seen my inhaler ? No , I haven 't seen your inhaler ! I 'm on the phone ! This is interstellar , you have any idea how much this costing me ! Get outta here ! [ MAN inhales ] [ MAN coughing ] [ MAN clears chest ] Anyway , where were we ? Oh right , you were talking about how you were gonna make it up to me . Were we ? Let me bottom line this for you , okay ? Ferrous wants your heads . Without their backing you 've got no political protect , which , given your records , I think we can all agree , is not a good thing . I 'm gonna take care of it , I 'm gonna smooth things over . And in exchange , you 're gonna do a job for me . What kind of job ? Oh walk in the park . Which is why you 're gonna do it for half of your normal rate . [ THREE ] No way . [ ANDROID ] It 's a freighter , ISS Far Horizon . It apparently suffered some kind of catastrophic system failure , the resulting explosion exposed most of the upper decks to spac . None of the crew survived . Unfortunately , the data stream provided by your friend was a little short on information . I don 't think he 's our friend . He gets the jobs , we do the job . [ THREE ] I don 't know , guy seems like a scumbag to me . What ? I 'm not allowed to have standards ? The thing I don 't get is why us ? Why not hire some licensed salvage operation to do the job ?

[ THREE groans ] Hey . If you wanted to go over the plans , for the salvage . Oh , sure . Why don 't we go up to the bridge and we 'll go over it . Are you coming ? Yeah . [ ANDROID ] As far as we know , the ship 's FTL drive is intact , but navigation from the bridge is impossible . If we can establish a remote lik in the engineering section , I might be able to upload a jump sequence from here . The ship will fly itself to its original destination .

Life support 's operational , but . It 's a little cold in here . [ ANDROID ] The ship is operating on emergency power only , but I estimate at least six hous before life support shuts down completely . That should be more than enough time . [ THREE ] I think we should look around a little first . We came here to do a job . You said it yourself , there might be some nice , tasty contraband kicking around here somewhere . Which they want back . That 's why they hired us . Half the ship 's exposed to spac . if there 's a little contraband that goes missing ? Am I right , hmm ? Yeah . Absolutely .

The ship 's infirmary is equipped with an isolation chamber . It would be more than adequate for quarantine purposes .

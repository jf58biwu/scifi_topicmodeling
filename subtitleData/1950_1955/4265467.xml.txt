 After it has been lost in outer space for 57 hours following a mechanical failure , Professor Bernard Quatermass is able to re-establish remote control over the world 's first manned space rocket when it swings again near the Earth . He is assisted by Judith Carroon , mathematician wife of one of the rocket 's crew , and his control engineers John Paterson and Marsh . It is brought down in an emergency landing near Wimbledon , and throughout the night , a huge crowd waits anxiously for the rocket to cool . When the door is opened , one man emerges . Victor Carroon . He seems dazed and unable to speak . When the professor and Marsh enter the rocket to look for Dr Reichenheim and Charles Greene , the other members of the crew ... There 's no sign of either of them . They 're gone . - They 're gone ! - What ? - What ? - They 're not inside . - They must be , unless they opened the door . - That door hasn 't been opened until now . Victor ! Where are the others ? Victor ! What 's happened ? He doesn 't seem able to talk . - Oh , he 's so cold . - Victor , wake up . - Wake up ! Answer me ! - Stop that . Leave him alone . - On the way back ... - You 're back . You 're home . - Don 't you know me ? - Judith ... - Oh , but he doesn 't . He 's so ill . - Yes , shock and exhaustion . Must get him out of here . Inspector ! No , no , gospel truth . There isn 't a sign . There 's nowhere inside that they could possibly be . I don 't understand . - Ambulance ! Quickly ! - Right , sir . No , don 't try to get him out of it . Lift him . Give him support . Better than a stretcher . - I 'm sorry to trouble you ... - This man 's ill . He 's a national hero , Inspector . Picture , Fred . Whatever he 's been through , he 's the first man to have done it . - Tell us . We want to know . - That 's enough ! - Support him along there . - No , wait ! Carroon ! I 'm cold . Cold ... - Help me . - Oh , Victor . Take him to the ambulance . Make way there ! Let them through , Sergeant . That suit they wear , it is like they show in comic magazines . Ah , Professor Quatermass . Any statement to make now , sir ? Mr Greene and Dr Reichenheim are missing . - Any theory ? - No chance of their being alive ? I prefer not to say . We must find out details from the base in Australia about the take-off . Why ? Is there any doubt they were in the rocket ? Mr Greene 's wife is arriving by Comet later today . And Dr Gordon Briscoe . He 's been responsible for the training of the crew in Australia . - They may have something to tell us . - Surely you know if the rocket had a full crew ? - Sorry , no statement . - Haven 't you spoken to the base ? - If there 's a possibility of a mistake ... - And the distance it travelled . - Any doubt about that now ? - Are Reichenheim and Greene on the Comet ? - What paper do you represent ? I apologise . - There will be a statement as soon as possible . - Why not now ? - All right , that 's enough ! - If you 're agreeable , I 'd like to have a look . - Of course . Come along . - Mitchell ! Nobody else past here . - Very good , sir . What sort of alibi was he handing out ? I 've got a good mind to go in there . - You heard what he said . - It 's not a weapon ? - No good hanging on here . Only lose time . - Yes , get the hero into print while he is one . - So this is it ? - Yes . You can call it snug or abominably cramped , whichever you like . Food supplies . Recording apparatus . Transmitter . Vision monitor . Remote control . Bunks for the crew . They 're strapped down during take-off . How far did you say it had travelled ? 384,672 miles . - Find any trace ? - Been down below . Nothing . - Mr Paterson , a member of my staff . - How do you do ? - Inspector . - Where does this lead to ? - It 's a limited access to the propulsion units . - For any maintenance during flight . I see . But no way out ? No . This is the only entrance . If you have more , you get pressure problems . That 's where we get the mystery , Professor . Inspector , take a look at this . You must accept our word for it , but this indicates it beyond any question . - That door was sealed throughout the flight . - What ? Why did you ? Leave this to me . I 'm afraid that won 't mean much to you . But the door must have been opened . Whatever this gadget is , couldn 't it be wrong ? I dare say . As inventors , we 're not infallible . The past two days have shown us that . I remember I once saw a film about a ... Well , I suppose you 'd call this a spaceship . Men opened the door and went out . They would ... They seemed to float . Quite correct . In space , nothing has weight . Yes , and one of them got lost . Could that happen in reality ? - Yes , it could . - Oh , er ... By the way , when they went out in the film , they were wearing ... What do you call them ? - Pressure suits . - Yes . To get through that door alive , they 'd have to use those , wouldn 't they ? Then why is this here ? That door must have been opened . Professor , I shall have to report this whole business . I shall have to report it . It would help if we could have a suit for examination . - Of course . Collect it whenever you like . - Thank you . - You didn 't want him to know about that door . - I 've got to work that out . It hadn 't been opened , had it ? John , I want all these instruments dismantling . We 've got to find out what went wrong with that transmitter . Then there 's the sound recorder . Marsh will help you . I 'm going to the hospital . - Ring if there 's anything . - All right , sir . Whitney made a better job of that technical waffle than I 'd have thought . Not a bad special edition . Finish your tea , James . - You surprised me , too , in a different way . - Did I ? I knew it was tricky , but I thought you 'd roast them . Yes ? Just on my way now , darling . We 've been busy . Yes , you can put the bacon on for breakfast . - Excuse me . - I 'm not a cynic , Jacko . I 'm troubled when I see a truthful man driven to petty evasions . - This professor , you mean ? - Yes . He was stalling desperately . And badly . For a moment , he looked ready to recant the whole story . There ... There 's no chance of a hoax , is there ? I was there , Jacko . No . Granted , he 'd been through frightful strain . Makes history and finds he 's lost two valued friends . - But that doesn 't make him tell fibs . - What , then ? Something had alarmed him so much , he felt he had to hide it . This technical waffle of Whitney 's . " Space velocities , synergic curves , mass ratios . " - All spaceship jargon . You get the feel of it ? - It 's above my head . It 's mankind trying to sound certain of himself , because he knows that just beyond the air begins a new wilderness . Pitch-dark both day and night . Empty and ... cold . You need breakfast as much as I do . Consider yourself invited . - Come along . The story 's written . - No . I 've an idea we haven 't started yet . - Thanks for the offer . - As you like . Hello . I want to find out about the Comet air service from Australia . Yes , arriving today . Try , darling . Try to remember . Were they hurt ? Hurt ... There was no ... Curious . Each time it 's almost an answer , but not quite on . Carroon , listen to me . Did they go outside ? Did they go out ? Outside ... From outside . Was the door opened ? Carroon , try to remember . Open ... - Open . - The door ? Was it ? Inspector , this must stop . Doctor said no excitement . Look at him . His hands . He can 't bear to be touched , as if it were painful . - Extraordinarily cold . - Doctors talk about shock . It 's too extreme . - Please , not in front of the patient . - Sorry , Sister . It 's my fault . - Could I have a word with you over here ? - Yes , of course . Sergeant , stay by him in case he says anything . Right , sir . This was the clothing he was wearing inside that outfit . Dr Briscoe designed them for the experiment . Layers of nylon . Each joins onto the next . It 's more wearable under the pressure suit . It would be difficult to remove from a sick person ? - Yes , it was . - Yes , of course . Oh , I 'm sorry , Mrs Carroon . We 're investigating this case as one of missing persons . There 's a lot that 's hard to understand , or to believe . Now , apart from your personal involvement , you are a technical expert on the background . - You 're the professor 's first assistant . - On the mathematical side . You 'll be likely to recognise significant facts or to give a meaning to anything he says . - I suppose so . - Of course . You will reach me at this number . Chief Inspector Lomax . Don 't hesitate . - Thank you . - All right , Best . I hope it 's only a temporary condition . Silly advice , but try not to worry . Thank you . Goodbye . - It can 't be . - What is it ? I don 't think he took it properly . Perhaps I should see the doctor . - You can 't come in here . - It 's all right . - I have instructions . - It 's all right , Sister . - I shall have to report this . - How is he ? - Still this abnormal cold . - The heat cradle doesn 't help , or the drugs . Victor . Quatermass here . Victor ? Look at me . All around ... All around . - Look at me , Victor . - Sometimes he does see you , then nothing . The things he says are like delirium . - Victor ! - Oh , it 's useless . His memory 's gone . Or his brain must have been damaged . Don 't sob . I can 't bear it any longer . I can 't bear it . It 's more than anybody could be expected to bear . - You don 't understand . - It 's a reaction . It can 't last . - When we know what he 's undergone ... - Don 't . Don 't comfort me . All those hours of waiting . The anxiety when the rocket was ... I did want him to come back . I did . You 've got to believe that . You 've got to . But we ... Go on . We weren 't happy . We tried very hard , but somehow he ... Never mind . Months ago , before he went to Australia I made up my mind to leave him . I see . Who is it ? May I know ? Gordon . Briscoe ? - Might have guessed . - We were going to be quite honest . Tell him as soon as the flight was over . When the rocket didn 't return , I felt disloyal . Almost as if I had caused it to happen . I couldn 't bear it . I wanted him to come back more than anything else in the world . And now ... Now he 's like that . I won 't ever leave him . - You 'll have to tell Gordon . - I will . Oh , well , there 's not much that I can say . No . Poor devil . Going to need you now , if ever he did . Your care . Do you notice his face ? Yes . I thought pressure effects didn 't last . - Who else has been here ? - Two men from Scotland Yard . - What did they want ? - They questioned him . They 're looking into it . They did more than that . - He 's been fingerprinted . A hasty job . - Fingerprinted ? They can 't suspect that he ... - What are you going to do ? - I 'm going to get him out of here . Sister ! Hello . British Experimental Rocket Group ? Research station ? Is Professor Quatermass back yet ? No . No , no . No message . - Fingerprint report in half an hour . - I can 't see the point , but it may help . He didn 't object . " We trust that the courage and daring by which he has accomplished this mighty feat " will be suitably and quickly rewarded . " - That 's the man whose fingerprints we took . - Yes . - Do you read science fiction ? - No . Well , we 'd better start to catch up on fact . Look at all this . All full of hero-worship . Whatever comes to light is going to be tricky to handle . There 's a Professor Quatermass here , sir . Got your card . He 's very insistent . - Show him in . - This way , sir . - Inspector Lomax ? - Just the man we want to see . Take a seat . - Without help from you ... - Why are you treating Carroon as a suspect ? Professor , that 's rather hard . We have to make enquiries . I can save you time . This contains particulars of all three members of the crew . Charles Greene . Ludwig Reichenheim . And Victor Carroon . All there . Personal descriptions . Medical histories . Academic achievements . Professional activities . Politics . Fingerprints . The only enquiry likely to be useful is a scientific one . I 'll carry that out myself . - I 've had Carroon transferred from hospital . - To your research station ? - Subpoena me and I 'll answer that . - Just one moment , Professor . Would you mind taking a look at this ? Best , give us that contraption . We obtained this with your permission . It belongs to one of the missing men . - Yes . - It 's just as you discovered it ? As far as I can see , yes . I believe specially designed clothing is worn with it , underneath . Now , if it were being removed from a body ... I said " if " . This would go first , followed by the linked sections of the inner garment ? He can 't just slip out of it , if that 's what you mean . It 's all there in one piece , linked . There must be some simple explanation . I thought perhaps you 'd be able to help us , Professor . Can you ? Must have time to consider this . I ... That shook him . BOAC Comet service No. 115 from Sydney , Darwin , Singapore has just landed ... You know , it 's as clear-cut as this . A : He 's on a level with Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus . B : It 's hokum . - How likely is B , with Quatermass 's reputation ? - Yes , but what happens ? Carroon is too ill to be seen or moved . Detectives see him and he is smuggled out . - It 's getting pettier . Why ? - Ask it in print . I don 't want to doubt the story . I just want to know . - Perhaps it 's murder . - This would be a time to pick . I bet they won 't be here , after their evasions and excuses . - Where 's the alternative ? - You 've got to know your way about . I know . Perhaps he does , at that . - On time , Professor . - What ? Oh , you . - James Fullalove , " Daily Gazette " . - Waiting for me ? Sorry . I like to watch the aeroplanes . Can I go this way ? I 'm meeting some people off this plane . I am very sorry , sir . People are looking this way . Two old ladies over there . A party of Belgian tourists there . That man who 's just bought a newspaper to confirm it really is Quatermass . - You can 't escape . You 've touched their lives . - What ? New horizons . A very nice trip indeed . There he is ! What happened ? In Rome there were newspapers with silly reports . - I told her not to believe anything . - Over here . No , tell me now , please . - I 'm sorry . - Oh , Charlie ... Charlie was gone ? I 'm afraid there was some sort of accident . Let me explain on the way . - I want to know ! - Not here , Mrs Greene . I want to know . I 'm here to watch the aeroplanes . Will passengers on BOAC flight No.24 to Sydney please take leave of their friends ... - There 's nobody here , either . - There they are . Come on . Those men were in the rocket when it took off . So you got the story ? No , no , no . - I admit they 're indistinct . - They 're a mess . I didn 't botch them . I 'm certain of that . I 've taken enough fingerprints in my life . That means the ones in Quatermass 's file aren 't his . THEY botched it . That 's more likely . Just a minute , though . You see those two tented arches ? - Yes . - Identical , absolutely . Yes , but on the other hand , look at the central pocket loops . No , no , no . There 's no scar there . Yeah , that central pocket loop . Well , I must be suffering from eye strain . I thought I 'd noticed it in ... - Memory , don 't let me down . - Those files belong to the other two men . Let 's get back to work . - The identical central pocket loop . - What ? Yes . Take it easy , Vic . There 's nothing to worry about . - Nothing ... - No . There 's nothing ... That blood pressure , it 's almost impossibly low . Pulse , temperature , reflexes , all the same . - He was perfectly fit before take-off ? - Strong as a horse . Possible effects of acceleration pressure . That was the part we always had to guess at . During testing he took 17 times the force of gravity without a headache . Out of control , they may have taken 30 . - If that didn 't kill them , it might have ... - Temporary changes . They pass in seconds . - It 's not just his face , you know . - Yes , I suspected that . I 'll show you . Victor ? I don 't think it 'll do him any harm to hear us talking . I doubt if he takes it in . I have accurate knowledge of the constitution of these three men after the examinations . - Well ? - First of all , the less important . Take a look at the skin , anyway . Here on the shoulder . Swollen . Coarsened , you mean ? That 's the way it would look under a strong magnifying glass , only there 's no glass . - Did the doctors say anything about that ? - No , no . Too concerned with the temperature . Go on . What else have you found ? I 'd rather not say until I 've taken some X-ray plates tomorrow . Bone structure ? I could be wrong about the length of a limb , but not about the shape of the bones . There 's been a change . I 'm convinced of it . - Change ... - All right , Victor . Changing ... - Go back ... - Easy , easy . This means something . Victor , what was changing ? When was it , Victor ? Was it something in the rocket that changed ? Gordon , I don 't like this . I 've always been afraid of something that we couldn 't deal with . - I 'll do everything I can . - I don 't just mean Carroon . Come along . Let 's get this over with . What we can be responsible for . 30 years ago I 'd almost decided to devote my life to land surveying in the tropics . That would have harmed only myself . I 'll give him something to step up the metabolic rate . - Have you found out anything ? - It 's not due to radiation from the propulsor . I 'll examine him when he 's gained strength . She insists on seeing him tonight . I told her he remembers nothing . It makes no difference . Somebody else to be responsible for . - Gordon , do you agree to this interview ? - Yes . Right . I 'll have a word with her first . - What harm can it do ? - Mrs Greene ? She 's nearly crazy with anxiety . - And Victor ? - Anything may jog his memory . A word , a face . - You can 't tell . - He had injections in hospital . It 's all right . I 've made a check . He didn 't even feel it . Gordon , I ... Yes ? I 'm staying , you know . With him ? Yes . There he is . Remember , don 't expect anything . - Victor . - Victor , it 's Mrs Greene . But he 's different . Look at him . His eyes , his expression . He 's a very sick man . Victor , try to remember . What happened to my husband in the rocket ? You must know . His eyes . What 's the matter with him ? The rocket ... - Victor . - Go on . Tell me about Charlie and Dr Reichenheim . What happened to them ? You 've got to tell me . The rocket ... - All ... - You were all inside . You went too far away . Far away . - Lou ... - Lou ! Charlie used to call me that . Didn 't like Louisa . They must have talked about me . He remembers . Victor , what did he say ? Try and remember . - You 'll only get him started . - Tell me , Victor . Cold ... Cold , Lou . - Here now . - Go on . - It 's Lou . I 'm here . - Stop it ! - What is he ? - He can 't remember . It 's upsetting you . - I want to stay . - Sit down . I 've got an idea . Now , listen . - Gordon , your film of the take-off . - I handed that to Marsh . - Marsh is back , is he ? - Yes . Marsh ? Quatermass . Did you and Paterson locate that ? He 's still out there ? That film that Dr Briscoe brought back from Tarooma of the take-off . Yes . I want that setting up for projection in three minutes ' time . All right ? Right . - Judith , take her to the projection room . - Why ? I 'm going to try something else . Please , please . Gordon , I 'll do anything to bring his memory back . Anything . Get him wrapped up . I want him to see that picture . Shock tactics can 't be relied on . - You can 't help Greene and ... - I 'll take full responsibility . You ARE afraid of something . Get him moving . You 've no need to worry , my dear . He 'll get well . - He 'll remember everything and tell us all . - You must try to keep calm , Mrs Greene . - You didn 't know my husband well . - I worked with him . That 's not the same thing . He was a very orthodox man . Books like to make scientists absent-minded , untidy people . Charlie was very particular . - Steady . Bring him over here . - He 's trying to walk . Balance must be affected by being weightless all that time in the rocket . - We 're all ready , sir . - All right , Marsh . Now , Victor , I want you to watch that screen over there . Are you hearing me ? Watch that screen and try to remember . - Try to remember ... - That 's it . BR7 two hours before take-off . Fuel pipe disconnected under the supervision of Mr Greene . Charlie ! There he is ! The rehearsed routine of checks was completed . Every item was examined . Propulsion chamber , control apparatus , food supplies , pressure clothing . I saw to the suits myself , of course . Then we took a sort of last-minute record . Well , this feels a bit pompous , but I just want to say I hope we make it . That 's all . I only wish my wife were coming , too . Dr Reichenheim was feeling pretty cheerful . How can anybody look heroic wearing the spare parts of a vacuum cleaner ? If this lot fizzles out , I hope it 's on an island with lots of pretty girls . Warum soll man sich denn Sorgen machen ? Auf dieser Welt oder in den nächsten . Speaking German just to tease Victor . He knew he didn 't understand . Here 's Victor himself . Well , this is it . I only hope I 'm able to do my sums properly when the time comes . Yes . Got a Union Jack in case we happen to land on Mars . Just a word with the wife . Bye-bye , darling . Take care of yourself . I 'll do my best to bring you back something , say a meteorite for the mantelpiece . Bye-bye , darling . And then the take-off . - Victor ? - Victor , do you remember now ? - You must . - Bring something back ... - Oh , why did I say that ? - If only I could have gone . - No reaction ? - Nothing . - Sorry , Louisa . I 've upset you for nothing . - No , no . Charlie was there . I was with him . Come with me , Mrs Greene . The sound recorder . We 'll try that . - You 've no right to go on testing him ... - What harm is it doing ? I 've got to know ! I feel so helplessly ignorant here . What am I , Gordon ? An ambitious charlatan or ? Sorry . That film made me remember , at any rate . Yes . What ? What was that last thing Reichenheim said ? My German 's not very good . I think it was ... " Warum soll man sich denn Sorgen machen ? " - " Auf dieser Welt ... " - So he got that . " ... oder in der Nicht . " - I didn 't know he spoke German . - Neither did I. Ask him a technical question on the rocket . How ... How is the gimbal system decontrolled ? Wie kann man das " gimbal system " von der automatischen Schaltung loslösen ? Durch Herausschaltung der automatischen Servomotors von den Schiebeachsen . Through declutching the automatic servomotors from their independent axis . Complete answer . Ask him his name . Lhr Name ist ? Doktor Ludwig ... There 's an Inspector Lomax here , sir . Would you come right away ? No further announcement concerning the two men missing from the British rocket vehicle which landed last night on Wimbledon Common . The sole occupant , Victor Carroon , is at present in hospital recovering from shock and exhaustion . It is confirmed ... A little out of date , aren 't they , Professor ? Did you bring him here ? - What can I do for you , Inspector ? - Ah , to the point . I 'm returning those files . - Find what you wanted ? - Not what I expected . We fingerprinted Carroon . I 'd like to repeat the procedure . - Now , look here ... - Officially . All right . He 's gone to his quarters with Dr Briscoe . - Found out anything ? - Nothing that 's evidence . - Changed your views about the door ? - No . Well , alive or dead , they went out of it . That much is certain . Is it ? Quatermass . Oh , yes , John . Did you ? As simple as that , eh ? Hold on , John . Paterson 's found a defect in the control apparatus . An electrical fault . Thank you , John . What ? Where ? All right . Yes , I 'll be over right away . Marsh ! Get Dr Briscoe quickly ! We 're going over to the rocket . - What did he say ? - He 's found something . It was when I was checking the safety casing of the wiring . It 's in here . - I thought I 'd better ring you straight away . - Can you get at it , Doctor ? - What is it ? - It 's a sort of powder , but it 's heavy . And I 'd say colloidal . - Organic . Is there any more of it ? - Yes . I tested different points . That stuff 's everywhere , lining the wall . The centrifugal force might have spread it out from ... - Well , from here . - A lot of it ? Yes . What went on here ? What did it do to them ? You 'll be able to see the next episode of " The Quatermass Experiment " next Saturday evening at a quarter to nine .

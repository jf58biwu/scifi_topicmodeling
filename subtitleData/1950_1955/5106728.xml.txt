 " Alraune " , or the Mandrake , has exercised since the earliest times a magical effect on people . From H.H. Ewers ' world famous novel , its shape is transformed from the ghostly night-shaded narrow neck of the imagination almost into human flesh . And in the future ? Certainly with our critical and skeptical minds , we are safe , but not always : the eternal effects of this dark and poetic eternal fable. and so arises again and again the immutable image of beautiful nature ... Alraune . Hey ! Hello Alois ! - You , Mr. Frank ? So late at night ? Has something happened ? Nothing has happened , but I must talk to my uncle . Open up ! The Professor is gone and I don 't know when he 'll be back . Was there a visitor ? A young girl , perhaps ? Sorry . I know of no visitors and no young girl . You should ask the Professor . Goodnight . How is it possible ? - To me it 's inexplicable ! What have you done with my daughter ? - We looked everywhere . They should have kept a better eye on her . We have done everything we could . Tonight even the door of her cell was locked . Locked ? - Yes . Alraune is locked in as a punishment . Why ? - We have ... found obscene literature under her mattress . Very interesting . Here . I will not tolerate such books . " Alraune " . The legend of the flower that blooms under the gallows . Anyway , I am glad that the girl is no longer with us . Alraune had a very disturbing influence on the other girls . Would you please say what you mean ? Although Alraune never harmed anyone , in her presence the other students completely changed . There is something about her , something strange . The anxiety , the agitation she causes . Not even we could escape its influence . What 's happened to Frank ? - Sit still , Man ! I 've got callouses on my ass . Just a few strokes left , Mr. Ingen . If Frank pays off his debts to me , I 'll get you a professional model . Here you are at last ! Boys , I 've experienced something incredible ! - A serious blow ? Have you become his heir ? Smell . - Magic ! Paris ! Not bad . Where is the lady ? You won 't believe it : Brinkenhof ! - The Professor is a Bluebeard ? The old man has a mistress ? Bravo ! Interesting . Go on , tell me ! Professor ten Brinken was not at home . Wasn 't he ? What does she look like ? I don 't know . I 've only seen her from afar . Aha ! A Fata Morgana , eh ? - She climbed down the trellis of a balcony like a cat . What , in the middle of the night ? Nonsense ! It 's not nonsense , my dear . - His imagination is blooming . He sees ghosts . This was no ghost . I saw her with my own eyes ! A girl ! A being of flesh and blood . If you don 't believe me , come with me and I 'll show you . What ? Now ? No , no . I 'm too tired . Well , I 'll go by myself . I 'll go see what my uncle is up to . But Frank , of course we 'll go with you ! She was over there . - I see nothing . I hear her . She gently caressed her toy , before it broke . It 's over there ! And had a yearning ... It 's coming from there ... And did not know what ... You go to the greenhouse . I 'll go by the stables . Because she was lonely ... If I don 't find anything , I 'll look in the house . And her mouth was as red as wine . And whoever drank the wine , could never be happy . But someone said in the spring , " And you could feel pleasure and pain " and he broke her a thousand roses , but she only broke his heart . Because she was lonely and her hair was so fair and her mouth was as red as wine . How could she kiss like that and yet be so lonely ? And what remained of her life ? A song that no one sang . Saint Peter waited for her for two eternities . Because she was lonely and her hair was so fair and her heart was as dead as stone . Then he cried , " Come , child , come . You shall never be lonely . " Tra la la , tra la la , tra la la . Did you find anything ? - No , nothing . And you ? - Nothing . Nothing . Then I 'll look in the house . Are you coming ? - No , no . Goodbye , see you tomorrow . - Goodnight . Look out ! Not so loud . Otherwise the others will hear . My father is a strange host . The house is full of visitors and he is not here . Your father ? Who 's your father ? Professor ten Brinken . He has a daughter ? Strange . Strange , seeing that he 's never said so . Why would he ? Who are you ? Frank Braun . His nephew . I have a cousin ? You should address me as " you " . Then you must give me a kiss . Is this yours ? - Yes . That 's him . He must have looked all over for me . I 've been very bad . There , I give it to you . Stay ! So he doesn 't see you . Three o 'clock tomorrow by the sundial ... Frank . The young lady came in a cab at nine o 'clock . Where is she ? - The young lady went to bed . Anything else ? - Mr. Frank was here . Yes , and ? - I sent him away . Very good . He would only have hit me up for money anyway . Well , Lisbeth ! Did you see her ? - Who ? The young lady . Isn 't she pretty ? - I don 't like her . To what do I owe this unexpected honor so late at night ? What can I do for you ? - Forgive me Uncle , but ... Again ? For how much ? 3,000 . I must pay my college tuition in the morning . Why can 't you admit you 're in debt again ? Don 't you have 3,000 ? That 's a lot of money . And you 're not the only one I support . Would it cost you your ... Does your daughter cost you so much ? What do you know about Alraune ? Is that her name ? Alraune ? Don 't you like her name ? You want to say that your daughter is named after mandrake ? Why shouldn 't she be ? - And who is her mother ? That doesn 't concern you ! Why have you never spoken of your daughter ? That 's my business . Of course I can understand your interest , and that her existence for you is not very pleasant . You know now that regarding the estate you 'll get nothing . I wanted you to find out after my death . As a pleasant surprise . Naturally you hate her . Me ? Why should I hate her ? She can 't help it . The hell with your money . - And what are you going to do now ? I 'll never come back . This of course will be difficult to bear ! Three o 'clock tomorrow by the sundial . I thought you were asleep . - Are you troubled , Papa ? So you were listening ? Did you learn that from the nuns in the convent ? Maybe . Why shouldn 't I listen ? Why are you here ? - They locked me in . I refuse to be locked in . Even in a convent . And I 'll never go back . Nor anywhere else . We 'll see . What did you say to the young man ? Can 't I speak to my cousin ? No ! I forbid you . He 's a reckless man . - He wanted to know who my mother was ? Everyone knows who their mother was , except me . Who was she ? She was a very lovely woman and you look a lot like her . Unfortunately , she died in childbirth . Did you love her ? Tell me ! Not now . It 's already late . Some other time . And if you find interesting books to steal from my library , learn to hide them better . What do you do with your time , dear Frank ? No man can work so much . But it was nice of you to visit . In fact , my Olga is coming home on vacation from school . God , you 'll love the dear child ! I 'll have to tell her the same . Come , have a drink . You can see her ... Olga ! Olytschka , a surprise ! Guess who 's here ! - Yes , Mama ! We 're very good sports , Frank ! We don 't mind that we haven 't seen you in so long ... I can understand it , if my oriole isn 't here ... Unfortunately it 's not for me to fly . Isn 't my little bird sweet ? What are you waiting for ? You stand there with your mouth open . All the time I tell her to watch her figure . But no , because all day she stuffs her mouth with chocolates ! Kiss each other already . You would not believe how the child longed for you . In each letter she asked for you . Yes , if you have your minds made up , I don 't mind . If you were engaged , your father would certainly have been happy . I fear there will be no doctor , Princess . - What 's that ? I was disowned yesterday , Princess . My uncle won 't pay my debts . I was going to consider another profession . - Nonsense ! What 's the matter with the old man ? - Tell me , Princess ... What do you know about Alraune ? - Olga , go see if the tea is ready . And if they 'll bring another cup . - Yes , Mama . How do you know about Alraune ? - I saw her yesterday for the first time . Then I can only advise : Don 't get burned . I cannot not tell you anything more . As for the old miser , I 'm already considering fracture . Or ... Ah , but go to the desk , Frank . The left-hand drawer . Yes , the left . The small notebook , lying on top . Why does my uncle hate me so , Princess ? - It 's no wonder . Because you want to become what he no longer can be . - I don 't understand . Didn 't you know ? He had his teaching license revoked at the University and he was thrown off the faculty . Since then every doctor is anathema to him . He will never forgive you for wanting to be a doctor . Didn 't you know all that ? - Kicked off the faculty ? Why ? Olytschka , bring me a bottle of ink ! - Yes , Mama . What is that thing ? - A fountain pen , the latest thing from England . Fabulous . It even writes ! I must have one ! It 's yours , Princess . - You 're a treasure , Frank . Can I at least pay you back ? Is this enough ? - Yes , but ... To finish your studies . Olytschka , you already know , Frank is going to the Sorbonne . - No , Mama . What ? Where am I going ? - To become a doctor in Paris . In Paris ? Why in Paris and not here ? I have my special reasons . It is better not to see Alraune again . I knew you would come . - You knew ? I almost didn 't . I wanted you to . Everyone does as I want , even if they don 't like me . But you like me , don 't you ? I knew from the way you looked at me yesterday . And yet I ... I like you too . Very much ! Alraune , I 've come to tell you I 'm leaving tomorrow . For Paris . - For Paris ? Oh , how wonderful ! I 'm delighted ! You rejoice that I 'm leaving ? But I 'm coming with you ! - But that 's not possible . Why not ? Everything is as I want . And I want to leave here . Away from this house , and the convent . - But how are we going ? Have you any money ? I 'll take it . I know where my father keeps it . Would you steal from your father ? - Steal ? Yes ! For you , yes . It isn 't important . Only one thing is important : Both of us together , you and me . - Alraune ! You 'll come fetch me ? Tomorrow afternoon , at the crossroads . Mr. Frank ! Mr. Frank ! The Professor wants to speak with you . Did they kiss ? - I wasn 't able to tell exactly . Tell me , MOhn . You don 't happen to know young Gerold Ingen ? The Count is a friend of my nephew . Our families run in the same social circles . Then it should not be a problem if they grow even closer . I would like you to keep him in mind for something . Do you understand me ? Completely , Professor . You wanted to see me ? - Yes . I 've thought about it ... You can have the 3,000 . - Thank you . But I don 't need it anymore . So ? You don 't even know what you want ? Yesterday you wanted the money . Today you don 't . Yesterday you would never enter my house again . Today you 're here . My coming here has nothing to do with you . Oh ! If you think you lost your inheritance reversed by the possibility of a future dowry , you 're wrong . You will never see Alraune again . And who 's to stop me ? - Me . Her father . You ? Is this the thanks I get for the help you 've received ? From now on I don 't need you to take care of me . - Great ! Now only tell me that you love Alraune , after having only seen her twice . - And if it were so ? Ha ! Then I would laugh ! If you knew something of Alraune 's origins , you wouldn 't speak of love . So I will tell the whole truth . I am not Alraune 's father . But I have created her . I wanted to prove that the artificial insemination of humans was possible . What are you saying ? - Yes . I have proved it . Although it cost me my post at the University , because my birdbrained colleagues didn 't believe me . But one day medical science will thank me . Can you guess who this is ? Alraune 's mother . Her name incidentally was Alma Raune . Funny , isn 't it ? After a long search in the Hamburg slums , she was introduced to me by " Princess " Wolkonska . The Princess was still Emma Knute , waitress in a sailors ' tavern . " The Rusty Anchor " . That was long before ... the rich and dotty Prince Wolkonski married her . Have you any idea who this is ? Alraune 's father . Handsome , eh ? He was hung on May 13 , 1888 in this city as a double murderer ... Before his death , we had a small piece of business with one another . The price was a bottle of cheap brandy . I gave him the opportunity with Alma Raune ... of making her a mother . Unbeknownst , of course . The result of this transaction you know , of course : The best evidence for my theory of heredity . She already shows symptoms to suggest , that she has inherited all the bad characteristics of her parents . Why did you do this ? If you really did it for Science , why did you experiment with the scum of the earth ? Why did you do it ? - The genetics of criminal tendencies are determined much more easily than those of the good . It 's also much more interesting . Good men are so uninteresting . What you did is a crime against Nature ! And yet you love this crime against Nature ? And when you turn this corner , you 'll be in the Rue Morgue . There you will find a collection of the most beautiful bodies in Paris . - Well , kids ! Paris ... I 'll probably never see the Louvre . How I envy you , you lucky devil ! - Etoile , Morgue , Louvre . Everything gets stolen . It doesn 't matter where you go . Listen to the Doctor ! He 's going to Paris and he 's not even looking forward to it . Nanu ? That 's not possible . The mermaid ? Are you snooping around ? What do you think of these crooks ? He said he hadn 't seen her at all . And you ? You haven 't seen her ? She 's probably a dream ? They both did , so they lied ! What do you mean , are you crazy ? - Let me , that 's mine ! - What is it ? Why do you carry on so ? He 's only drawn her and quite wrongly ! She shouldn 't pose . No one should draw her . I don 't want to see or hear anything more about her . And if I might give some good advice : Keep your hands off . Gentlemen , I apologize for the need to disrupt your harmony , but if Mr. Braun is going to catch the night train , we must hurry . So here you are . I 've looked for you everywhere . All you feeling all right ? You look so pale . I 've got a headache . I 'd like to be alone . Oh , I 'm sorry . Someone down there wants to talk to you . Who ? - A surprise ! Come . You don 't want to be rude ? Excuse me , Mademoiselle , for having made you wait . Come closer . This is Mademoiselle Duvalier . Allow me to introduce my daughter Alraune . I 'm delighted to know you , Mademoiselle . I 'm sure that we 're going to get along superbly , n 'est-ce pas ? What do you mean ? - You didn 't want to go to a boarding school . Mademoiselle Duvaliere will guide you through your necessary studies . Here in the house . - I don 't need a governess . But I 'll be a good friend to you . A comrade , n 'est-ce pas ? Don 't bring down your suitcase . Your cousin left last night . You 're lying ! Doctor Mohn ! You will excuse me , Mademoiselle , my daughter loves her cousin very much . The usual case of puppy love . Doctor ! Would you care to tell my daughter where Mr. Braun is ? Mr. Braun left last night for Paris . I don 't believe it . - Miss , I myself brought him to the station . That 's not true ! Mr. Braun crossed the border ... about five hours ago . And he left nothing for me ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . This afternoon I did not mean what I said . I understand that . Me too , sometimes . When there 's a letter , what should I write : " The Sorbonne , Paris " ? What is he studying ? - Medicine . Then you must write : " La Faculte de Medicine . Rue de la Faculte de Medicine , Paris 16 . Thank you very much . Do you love him very much ? Yes , very . Let 's not stay here , Mathieu . Let 's go ! - Lisbeth ! Will you stop ? Will you give up your position now your father is having trouble with the mortgage ? Why ? - I don 't know . I feel strange . - You only have something against the girl . Mandrake is Nightshade . Which is toxic , Mathieu . They 're poisonous ! Oh , nonsense ! - What about the male root in the library ? It has a real head , arms and legs as if it were living . But it has no soul . What may I offer you , Mademoiselle ? Cognac , Whisky ? No thank you , but perhaps a little Benedictine . - Good . Cognac ? Lisbeth ! For the three months I 've been here I 've wondered , what is that ... terrible thing . This is Mandragora officinarum . It is mandrake , or alraune . It grows under the gallows . Under the gallows ? Perhaps I was grown under the gallows ? It brings good luck and health , they say . But also destruction and death . Lisbeth , take this away , please . What is it ? Why are you crying ? The day after tomorrow they will auction my father 's land . Grieger said the farm 's in trouble . - Why don 't you buy the land ? Buy ? A desert covered with sand ? Why ? - Maybe you 'll have luck with this . I 'd buy it . Mathieu , prepare the carriage ! The soil is not strong enough . I 'd buy it . I 'd buy it . You 'll find gold there ! Gold , here ? Are you mad ? Yes , Gold ! Let 's dig , Papa . Mathieu , dig here ! Dig on ! While the sun 's on it ! What a stench ! Like rotten eggs ! - Sulfur . Sulfur ? Good , the field 's sold. - Tomorrow I 'll do the necessary business with Grieg . And take a water sample for the analysis . I see fantastic opportunities . I should build a well . - Should I obtain a quote ? But I don 't have enough money on hand . - Why do you need money , Papa ? For your spring , Alraune . You have discovered the best source of mineral water in the entire country . Why not get money from the Wolkonskas ? Mohn , isn 't my daughter a financial genius ? I find the gracious lady 's proposal to be excellent . Telephone the Princess . Tell her that I have a very interesting project in mind . SPA UNDER CONSTRUCTION So you see Emma , this is the spring in the well house . It will be called Alraunenquelle , because it is in fact due to her . How strangely it was discovered . The whole area will be transformed into a resort . How much of a stake would you want to buy in for ? Let 's say 75 percent ? Would you like to do everything for me ? - Yes . I must go to Paris next week . What shall I do with Olytschka ? I cannot take my dove to Paris . - Of course not . It would hamper your activities ! - Not a word ! I 'm too old and comfortable . Why couldn 't she stay with us ? The governess could look after her . Olga , a letter for you ! From Paris ! Nothing for me ? - Yes . My letters . " Returned to Sender " . - I 'm so sorry . Think of it , Alraune , Mama met Frank in Paris ! She writes : " Frank can 't wait to return , in three or four weeks . after he takes his oral examination . Anyway we have agreed , that your official engagment should be announced immediately on his return . " Isn 't life wonderful , Alraune ? If you knew how I loved him ! I would do anything for my Frank . Frank Braun is common . How ? Because he lies . - But he promised Mama he 'd marry me ! Exactly . And he told me you were a silly goose to love him . That 's not true ! If a man said that about me ... I don 't know what I would do . Maybe I would kill myself . Has he said anything ? - Nothing . Yes , I would kill myself . - Alraune , tell me the truth ! Has he actually written you himself ? Well ? No . He hasn 't . I thought so ! If a man really loves a woman , then he writes himself . It has nothing to do with Mama 's law . Yes , but ... what can I do ? I knew what I was doing . I told you already . Then he could never be happy and I would never forget . A touching farewell letter , everybody finds out and he knows why . And then ... TO BE READ AFTER MY DEATH Alraune , are you asleep ? Alraune ! - What is it ? Perhaps you took my sleeping powder ? Why do you say that ? - Tell the truth , Alraune ! It 's very serious ! What do you want ? I never lie ! My God ! Olga ! Olga ! Olga ! Did you see anything ? What can I do ? Professor , Professor . Professor ! Come quickly ! Olga 's taken poison ! Quickly , quickly ! Here , look . Oh , my God ! Quick ! Fast , lots of milk ! Perhaps you had something to do with it ? I was sleeping . Mademoiselle is my witness . But she hasn 't died . Once again she feels quite well and eats chocolate all day . Eat a little , my darling , if it pleases you . Eat ! How did you find Paris ? - Don 't ask stupid questions ! I was half-mad with fear when your telegram came ! And I don 't let it dissuade me that Alraune is behind this . - But Mama ! What has Alraune got to do with it ? It was entirely my idea . I suddenly had the feeling that Frank no longer loved me . But Frank still makes such eyes about you ! He wanted to come along to save you . But you 're coming home with me right now . If you stay here a second more ... I 'll grab the suitcases . - But hurry , will you ? What are you thinking , to suspect Alraune ? I think we both need no longer pretend . Look Papa , what Olga has given me . To remember her by . No , as a reward . Funny . I once had almost the same necklace . From my mother . One moment , please . Dearest Lady : I expect you at 6 by the crossroads . Your devoted servant , GEROLD INGER Thank you , Mathieu . My horse , quickly ! Look at the black clouds ! I think it 's better to go inside . I wanted to go riding . - No , it would be too dangerous . Miss , a storm is coming ! - It will be beautiful . We can 't go back now . We have to find shelter . You can wait outside until I 'm dressed , or at least shut the door . - It isn 't about me , but ... I 'm worried . If it 's still raining when we get home ? Then we 'll just stay here . I think it 's very nice here , don 't you think ? I 'll sleep on the table and you on the two chairs . Or would that be too uncomfortable ? But what will the Professor say ? - Papa ? He gets a kiss and everything is in perfect order . Have you seen Alraune ? - No , isn 't she in her room ? No , she wanted to go riding , but I forbade her because of the storm . She 's gone ! I 'm very worried . Was anyone looking for me ? - Yes , Dr. Mohn and the Frenchwoman . Brush him and give him a good wash . Professor ! Here she is ! Where have you been all night ? Good morning , Papa . You 're up already ? Answer me ! Where have you been all night ? In the bathhouse by the lake . With Count Gerold Ingen . What ? - Don 't worry , Papa . The count is nice , but not dangerous . Besides , he proposed to me . And what did you answer ? - That I don 't think of marriage . You 're smarter than I thought . But why didn 't you obey Mademoiselle ? Yes , I expressly forbade you to ride ! I couldn 't make the Count wait . But you could make your father wait ! - Papa knows me . And as for me ? You have indeed been paid to . I think I was too good to you . - Mademoiselle is right . If you don 't obey her , what is her purpose ? - Yes , what is it ? Then would you at least allow me to bathe and change my things ? Yes , enfant terrible ! - Merci beaucoup , Mademoiselle . Yes , today I enjoyed it . And if you look at me , I cannot help it . Today I find myself beautiful . Yes , beautiful . And if a man does too , I can understand . For I feel they all love me And they have only one thing in mind But I just smile cooly and then they wonder , If I 'm only a beautiful dream ? Today I liked myself . Yes , today I enjoyed it . But what no one sees in me , is the fear inside . Look at you two ! You love each other very much ? Yes Miss , very much . Mathieu , I would like to ask you ... - Mathieu cannot drive , he 's quit ! Tomorrow , Lisbeth . Tomorrow he has quit . But today he 's still serving us . I would again like to ask him ... Mathieu , get ready . I don 't like to wait . Mathieu ! Don 't , Mathieu ! Don 't go ! Stay here ! You hear me , Mathieu ? I heard . I should run out to her . - Mathieu ! For God 's sake , you love her ! Yes , but what is it ? It 's her voice , Lisbeth . Her voice . Gerold ! No ! What is it ? He 's dead . Where were you ? Where were you going with him ? Answer ! Answer me ! What is this nonsense ? If you don 't want me to recognize you ... Then don 't bathe in that Parisian stench . - You don 't like it ? You 're always in a bad mood . - Perhaps you would laugh and perform somersaults , do you do such tricks ? Maybe it 's my fault ? Was he driving or was I ? I could have died too , of a broken neck . - Hardly . Where are you going ? - To Wolfie . You wanted a picture of me . Have you asked for Mademoiselle 's permission ? - No , nor will I. What do you mean ? I 'd like you to dismiss her . Send her away . Why ? - She hit me . And did you deserve it ? - Will you send her away or not ? I wouldn 't think of it . - How do you mean ? Au revoir ! Good morning . - Doctor Mohn ! - How is my young lady ? Oh ... Would you do me a favor ? Naturally ! There 's nothing I wouldn 't do for you . When she slapped me , you stood by and did nothing . I 'll show you I 'm your friend . But you 're my father 's employee . I 'd be happy if I could convince you otherwise . What can I do for you ? - My glove . Don 't you agree that Mademoiselle is a nuisance ? Thank you . Can 't you even be still a moment , Alraune ? I get tired . Let 's stop for today . - Be sensible . If you 're so restless , I can 't finish the painting for your father . The epee was lower . Lower ! And the eyes more to the right . Stop , stop , this is too much . I don 't recognize anything about you anymore . It won 't be easy . I try to paint you as I see you and you only make fun of me . I 'm tired . I cannot work like this ! Do you love me , Wolfie ? Don 't you know ? I know nothing at all . - You feel that way ? Feel ? Alraune ! - Don 't be so wild , Wolfie . It doesn 't suit you . You have to be delicate . You see ? Now it 's good . I love you , Alraune ! Careful ! This could pierce your heart . Please , just a little . Yet only Frank could make you well again . Frank ! Frank , all the time Frank ! Can 't you ever think of me ? Of you I don 't think so . You 're here . Have you heard from Frank ? No . You wanted to work some more . Didn 't you ? Tell me Goutram , what you have actually painted , before you knew Miss Alraune ? - What do you mean ? Because for years no image could I admire you for , nor for the things Alraune was wearing . - Such kind wit ! What do you want ? - In order for Professor ten Brinken to be satisfied , your work needs to be completed on time . - Thank you . Tell the gentleman , that the Kursaal will be shown to the public on time . That is , if you don 't keep me any longer . - Oh God , how could I ? I know how hard it is for artists to work without their models , especially when there is no time for him , because every minute is spent with Count Gerold Ingen . Salute ! Poor Wolfie , he works all day while we ride . We ride to walk , but ... - But what ? Hello , Wolfie ! Alraune , how many times do I have to ask you to be my wife ? Why do you torment me so ? Have you no heart at all ? Doctor Mohn ! I 'm glad to meet you . I have to talk with you . Gerold , I 'll see you at the Ball . I 'll be expecting you . Do you remember a similar situation ? When I was asking you for something . Yes . - I thought you 'd already forgotten . Alraune , where are you ? The carriage is here . My necklace has disappeared ! - What do you mean , " disappeared " ? Messy as you are , you probably misplaced it . Get another one . No , for this dress I want no other . I must have that one . Calm down , Miss . We will find the necklace . Qu 'est que c 'est passe ? What happened ? - My necklace is gone . Have you perhaps seen it ? - No . It must be in your room . I know it was there . Now the box is open and the key is missing too . Where did you put the key ? - On top of the box . I never lock it . I don 't understand . Then the necklace may have been stolen . Who in the house would steal ? There are after all other people here that also wear necklaces . Are you perhaps talking about me ? - Speak carefully , Mohn ! But it 's too much . To be suspected by this man ! Please Professor , look for yourself in my room , in my suitcase ! But Mademoiselle , calm yourself . No one 's accused you ! But this man has already implied it was me . Please Professor , I 'm asking you . My honor is at stake ! Here , check and see . Please ! And here , here , here ... This really isn 't necessary , Mademoiselle ! - Here and here and here ... One moment ! What 's this ? That 's not possible . - You see , everything 's possible . You planted it . But no one will believe I stole it ! No one ! I think it is best , Papa , if Mademoiselle leaves the house . His Majesty the King , in recognition of your great services with the discovery of this healing source and the founding of your resort , you Professor , are given the title of Privy Councillor . His Excellency the Minister , Mr. Landrat , the Mayor , ladies and gentlemen . This evening is ... Why , Lisbeth ! How things have changed . Do you no longer work for my uncle ? - No , my husband is dead . I 'm so sorry . He was always so healthy . - He had an accident . An accident ? What happened ? - You have to ask the young lady . Miss Alraune ? What has she got to do with it ? I say nothing . I wouldn 't want to lose my position . I 've two children . And now I have the honor , on behalf of the Alraunenquelle Consortium , to open the baths to the public . May I ask for the first dance ? Sorry Doctor , but it is already taken . - Too bad . Here is the key to your jewelbox . I thought it would be worth the first dance . Oh , it was you ? - Aren 't you satisfied ? One moment . I 'll see you later . Alone . Perhaps I 'll tell you something . - Does this mean I can hope ? I said maybe . Gerold ! Hello Frank ! This is a surprise . You wouldn 't believe how happy I am . Is she not a magical creature ... Alraune ? Alraune . - I think today I am the happiest man in the world . And as for her ? Does she love you too ? - She hasn 't told me yet . There 's Wolfie . I should say hello . Hello , you old witch doctor ! When did you get here ? This morning . - This morning ? That 's just like you . Well , you 've finally come back from Paris to see your old friends . Well ? Has the cat got your tongue ? Or have you forgotten your native language ? How are you ? - The same . I wanted to ask you : How is your health ? Please , I 'm doing fine . - You look all spruced up . Look ! Everything here has been created in the last few weeks . I haven 't even gone to bed . But never has my work given me so much joy . - I can see that . A little too much Alraune , don 't you think ? Actually I didn 't want to paint them , but ... it all came from her . Finally even the source was named after her . The walls weren 't big enough . Wolfie , get me a glass of champagne . I 'm thirsty . - Yes , immediately . How long have you been here ? - Since today . Why didn 't you come for me ? Why didn 't you answer my letters ? Why didn 't you write at all ? Don 't you even want to answer me ? No . Do you love Olga ? Don 't ask me . Wolfie , where have you been ? Come , I want to dance ! Well , this time you 've shocked me , Jakob . I 'm proud of you , Privy Councillor ! Everything you touch turns to gold . Have you already found a doctor for your spa ? We 've had many applicants and will decide in the next few days . It 's already decided . Fresh from the Sorbonne ... You cannot mean Frank ? - Of course . I 've hired him . By the way , he should have been here long ago . - Are you crazy ? Who gave you permission to interfere in my affairs ? Well , with my 75 percent I have something to say about it . My future son-in-law will be the doctor and that 's that . He already knows his way around . You are a shameless hussy . - Cheers ! Well Frank , where have you been ? We 've been waiting for you all night . You see ? Olytschka is dancing with someone else to punish you . Olytschka , isn 't this a surprise ? - I 'm so happy ! Good evening and congratulations , Privy Councillor . I 'm pleased to know I 'll be working with you . I didn 't know you 'd been hired . I just heard from the Princess . I 'm afraid it 's too much for me . - Yes , it 's very hot in here . Let 's go into the conservatory . It was suffocating in there . - But here it 's nice and cool . Suddenly I couldn 't bear it . The air ... My dear Wolfie ! - Alraune , I must ask you something . I ... - What do you want to ask ? What is it ? - Sorry to disturb you , but I 've been watching the dancefloor . Aren 't you feeling well , Wolfie ? - What do you mean ? I 'm fine . You must understand . As a possible spa doctor he has to study patients . Your irony isn 't amusing . - Mind your own business . This sudden concern for me . Save your breath . This is a tedious argument . I 'm going on the balcony . Are you crazy ? Hot as you are in this cold ? What did you want to ask me , Wolfie ? - Yes , Alraune . I find it touching how concerned the doctor is for you . But how long must I wait ? - I 'm coming ! You 're looking for someone , Gerold Ingen ? - Have you seen Miss ten Brinken ? Alraune ? No . What gives you the right to call Miss ten Brinken by her first name ? That surely doesn 't concern you . - Take care , Mohn . You 're speaking of my future wife ! White mandrake for your happiness ? For this I demand satisfaction ! - My pleasure . What was the matter with Mohn ? - He 's insulted Alraune . Has he asked to fight you ? - Yes . - Do you know he 's a good shot ? What of it ? Does that give him the right to insult my future wife ? Do you want to marry Alraune ? - Yes . - Did you also give it good ? But what is there to consider ? You were gone a long time , Frank . You don 't know what I do , otherwise you 'd know who loved Alraune once , would die for her too . - But , Gerold ! What 's got into you ? I know you won 't fight them all . Dich , Mohn , Wolfie ... - Mohn , Wolfie ? What have they got to do with Alraune ? What have you got against her ? She 's your own cousin ! - Don 't ! Dich and Mohn will fight each other , and Wolfie believes he 's next . So now you know . - You 're lying ! Where 's Alraune ? I 'll go tell her who we have for friends . Is it possible to love more than life what is without life , just because it 's beautiful ? But you 're living . And I love you , Alraune ! Wolfie ! - I love you and I 'm happy ! Can you also be happy without love ? - No . No one can . Is that your heart beating so ? - You can feel it ? Strange . I feel only yours and not mine . I love you , I love you ! And how long does love last ? An eternity . - And what is eternity ? Gerold Inger duelled Mohn . He was shot dead , a kind of suicide . Also Wolfie caught his death at the ball . Thank God , Miss . He 's been waiting for you . Is it very bad ? - The doctor has little hope . Ah ! But it is nice that you came . Sit down . The picture is finished . Why do you look at me like that ? - But you 're so cheerful , Wolfie . I have no reason to be sad . You 're here . And now you 'll always be with me . Won 't you ? Please stay calm , Mr. Goutram . Otherwise the doctor will scold you . But Sister , I feel very well . Come . Kiss me , Alraune . Alraune ... Give him a kiss ! Kiss him at last ! Frank ! Thank you , but I 'll no longer be needing you , Sister . I 'm sorry I took so long . What did you want ? You have to listen to me . I have two accidental deaths on my hands . But when I saw you again after so long and you were ... Since then I no longer know what I 'm doing . You must help me . There is something in me I cannot explain . I can 't control it . I can 't cry . Why can 't I cry like other people ? Help me ! I cannot help you . - I know you can . Why did you leave ? Why did you do that ? Perhaps it was cowardice , Alraune . I was afraid . Why do you hate me ? - I never hated you . Here , I have something for Lisbeth , Mathieu 's wife . She has two children . She 's not well . - Alraune ... You 're crying ! " Various well-founded sources have claimed that Professor ten Brinken 's Alraunenquelle is nothing but a swindle . Professor Martin of the Medical Faculty has demanded an immediate investigation by the Ministry of Health . " Since sounds but to everything ! This is outrageous ! Against the intervention of the Minister however we would be powerless . Powerless ? What have I to fear ? I can feel your heart . It 's everywhere . Everywhere . I see it on your forehead , in your eyes , on your mouth . Oh , Frank ! I love you . - Alraune ! Since you 've been with me , I 'm transformed . All that was before is like a bad dream . Why , Frank ? - Because now you love . Love is the divine in Man . Love is joy , but also pain . Love is kindness . - Kindness ? And I was evil . - Evil ? If a child is angry with an animal and hurts it , without feeling pain himself , how can he be hurt ? A child isn 't evil . Only heartless . Yes . Only when you love do you grow a heart . Oh , Frank ! A life without love is an evil one . I think an investigation should be avoided at all costs . Yes . Prevented ! But how ? There is one possibility . An old duelling buddy of mine is a officer at the Ministry of Health . And ? What could he do ? For example , the order ... could disappear . And what would that cost ? - Not a cent . Not a cent ? How could that be done for nothing ? Because of me . They 'll do something for nothing . What do you want ? With pleasure ! Take it down immediately . Not the picture . The original . You must be joking ! - I never joke about such things . She , my Alraune ? What do you think my daughter would say ? I think in all modesty , with a return of my feelings , the young lady can expect a great deal . What do you mean exactly ? The fact that no sacrifice is too great to avoid a catastrophe . A catastrophe ? What are you talking about ? It could happen that in the investigation a few ... unpleasant details could come to light ... For example ? - For example , some experiments not only against Nature , but against the law . No one knows except you . Exactly . You 're fired ! - Think about it . Although I 'm afraid you don 't have much time . Get out ! Before I kill you ! I must go now . - You are forbidden to leave ! I won 't let you . - I need to see him . I 'll tell him everything . That I 'm staying with you . See you soon . I want to know where you were . - With Frank Braun . Oh , with Frank Braun ? And you say it just like that ! I expressly forbade you to see him ! Yes . And yet I will see him again . Because I must do so forever . - So then it 's happened ? You want to be a solid citizen ? My beautiful , mysterious Alraune , the wife of a doctor who prescribes a few drops . Every year another baby . But as I love you I know it won 't last long . I think you 're wrong . I love him . I know you cannot understand , but I love him . So , you really love him ? - Yes , and I have the right to . No ! You 're Alraune . What does my name have to do with it ? I am a woman . I laugh , I cry . I have a heart like everyone else . You must not truly love a man . You cannot order me . And I have no more fear . Your laughter will die away , when you know if you dare , where you come from . Find out who your parents were ! Here ! You 're the spitting image of your mother . No love child are you . Your mother never saw your father . She was , so to speak , only a means to an end . And you are the result of my experiments . The living proof of my theory . My creation ! I have created you ! You were grown under the gallows , just like the mandrake plant . You have all the unique characteristics of your inestimable parents . Does Frank Braun know everything ? - Yes . That 's why he fled . But he 's come back . - Yes , to his own destruction . Because you now know you will drive him to death , just as you did the others : Mathieu , Wolfie , Gerold Ingen . Or have you already forgotten ? And now the chime tolls for Frank . So now you can go to him . Lose no time . He 's probably waiting for you . Go ! Why don 't you go ? Go ! You go , but to him ? You want to kill him ? No . For I love him too much . I 'll stay with you . Frank ! Can you believe it ? Dr. Mohn has unleashed the prosecutor ! What will happen to my money ? He reported the Professor ! An arrest warrant is out . - That doesn 't interest me . Do you know something about Alraune ? Have you heard from her ? For two days I 've been waiting ! - Why should your Alraune interest me ? Would this creature had never been born ! By this time tomorrow we will be far far away from here . I 've a lot of money abroad . Every wish I see in her eyes , I 'll fulfill if I can . Alraune and you ? Your ingratitude stinks to Heaven ! Has the bitch finally gotten to you ? - I forbid you to speak like that of Alraune ! I should have guessed . The doctor is interested in Project Alraune . - Hold your tongue ! No one can know . Have you been reading the newspapers ? Listen to this : " Reviled Professor creates a being through artificial insemination ! " It 's about Alraune ! - And her , does she know ? Naturally ! He keeps no secrets from her . I must see her . - Stop ! I 'm coming with you . Everyone will envy us . Me and you . Won 't you enjoy that ? Look at me . Why don 't you speak ? Say just one word ! - If you 'll allow me to . I have to get dressed now . The Privy Counselor is not receiving anyone ! You 'd like that ! To beat it now and leave me in the dirt ! I hope you go to hell . I won 't miss you , but first you 'll give me my money back ! How much I 'm involved makes me dizzy ! I haven 't forced you . Your own free will and your greed have enmeshed you ! It 's not my fault that the source dried up . But it is ! It was your idea : The Alraunenquelle ! Everything with that witch goes wrong ! First she poisoned my Olytschka to have Frank for herself . She did that . But now ... now I 've lost everything ! That I intended to live on with my dear Olytschka ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune ! Alraune , what is it ? Frank ! - Why didn 't you come back to me ? You know why . What do you want from me ? Go . Please ! Before it 's too late . - It 's never too late , Alraune . Come with me ! You must forget all that ! - Forget ? Wolfie , Gerold Ingen , Mathieu . They 're always staring at me . There . And there ! And there ! From every corner . Don 't you realize I love you ? - And they didn 't ? And they didn 't die because of me ? Exactly because of me ? No one dies except because of himself . Alraune ! Don 't touch me . I 'll bring you bad luck . Rid yourself at last of the thought that you are something bizarre . You are human like everyone else . - Why do you lie to yourself ? You won 't realize that my life began in crime . I 'm nothing but a dirty joke ! You can 't say that . Alraune , no one is all bad . The good in people gives them the strength to overcome the evil . If only the bad survived , the world would be a hell ! There is no good in me . Where should it come from ? I am born of the evil thoughts of an evil man ! A crime that one man arbitrarily set up in the world without love , a madman 's plaything . Anyone who grows up without love is sick . You weren 't evil , Alraune . You were sick . You can 't stay here . You must come with me ! Now you want to disappear with Alraune . But it won 't do . Frank Braun has come with me , in order to take her away . Why did you do that ? She was my creation . She didn 't belong to any man . Now she 's broken , the toy , that God didn 't want . Subtitles by ironhills for CG February 2010

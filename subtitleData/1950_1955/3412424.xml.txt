 Call headquarters . Get the lieutenant . Holy Christmas ! That thing 's doing about 4,000 ! That 's incredible , sir ! That can 't be aircraft . Must be a buzz bomb . This is Lieutenant Harris at Charlie Baker . I have a bogey at 2-0-0 thousand feet . 4-0-0-0 miles an hour . [ Speaking Hindi ] [ Radio Announcer Speaking French ] Reports are coming in from all over the empire ... from all over the world . The government has notyet issued any statement ... but there seems to be no question ... that there actually is a large unidentified object ... circling the Earth at incredible speed . This is Elmer Davis again . We still don 't knowwhat it is orwhere it comes from ... but there 's something there . It 's been tracked around the Earth by radar ... traveling at a rate of 4,000 miles an hour . This is not another flyingsaucerscare . Scientists and military men are already agreed on that . Whatever it is , it 's something real . Announcer : . We interrupt this program to give you ... a bulletin received from one of our naval units . A large object traveling at supersonic speed ... is headed over the NorthAtlantic ... toward the east coast ofthe United States . This is H.V. Kaltenborn speaking . Here in the nation 's capital ... there is anxiety and concern ... but no outward sign of panic . As a matter offact , there are signs of normalcy . The beautiful spring weather ... the tourist crowds ... around the public monuments and other buildings . [ Eerie Humming ] [ Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Humming Stops ] They 're here ! They 're here ! It landed ! Over on the mall ! It landed ! [ Sirens ] Get me the chief ofstaff . Hold the line , please . Hold the line , please . Hello ? . I want to speak to the president . I 'm sorry , butyou have to interrupt him . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . This is Drew Pearson . We bring you this special radio-television broadcast ... in order to giveyou the very latest information ... on an amazing phenomenon ... the arrival ofa spaceship in Washington . Government and defense department officials ... are concerned by reports of panic ... in several large eastern cities . I am authorized to assure you ... that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm . Rumors ofinvading armies and mass destruction ... are based on hysteria and are absolutely false . I repeat--these rumors are absolutely false . The ship designed for travel outside the Earth 's atmosphere ... Ianded in Washington today ... at 3 : .47 P.M. Eastern Standard Time . We still do not know where it came from . The ship is now resting exactly where it landed 2 hours ago ... andso far , there is no sign oflife from inside it . Troops have been rushed across the Potomac River ... from Fort Myer ... and have thrown a cordon around the ship . They 're supported by tanks , artillery , and machine guns . Behind the police line ... there is a huge crowd of curiosity seekers . The army has taken every precaution ... to meet any emergency which may develop . Every eye , every weapon , is trained on the ship . I t 's been that way for 2 hours ... and the tension is just beginning- - J ust a minute , ladies and gentlemen ... I think something is happening . We have come to visityou in peace ... and with goodwill . [ Screaming ] Man : Look , it 's hurt ! Look ! 2nd Man : Boy , oh , boy ! [ Screaming ] Gort ! Deklato prosko ! It was a gift foryour president . With this , he could have studied life ... on the other planets . Get that ambulance over here . Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away . Yes , sir . Mr. Harley , sir , from the White House . General . Right in there , Mr. Harley . [ Knocks ] My name is Harley . Secretary to the president . I 've been told you speak our language ... and your name is Mr ... Klaatu ? . Just Klaatu . The president asked me to convey his deepest apologies ... forwhat has happened . Sit down , Mr. Harley . Thankyou . I 'm sure I need hardly point out ... thatyour arrival was something ofa surprise . You been traveling long ? . About 5 months . Your months . Must have come a long way . About 250 million ofyour miles . Naturally , we 're very curious ... to know where it is you come from . From another planet . Let 's just say that we 're neighbors . Rather difficult for us ... to think of another planet as a neighbor . I 'm afraid in the present situation ... you 'll have to learn to think that way . The present situation ? . I mean the reason for my coming here . We 're very curious about that , too . Would you care to talk about it ? . I 'd be glad to . Not now , of course , with you alone . Perhaps you 'd like to discuss it personallywith the president . This is not a personal matter , Mr. Harley . It concerns all the people on your planet . I--I 'm not sure I understand . I want to meet with representatives ... from all the nations ofthe Earth . I 'm afraid that would be a little awkward . It 's completely withoutprecedent . And there are practical considerations . The time involved , the enormous distances . I traveled 250 million miles . I appreciate that , but ... I want to be frank with you , Mr ... I mean , Klaatu . Our worldat the moment ... is full oftensions and suspicions . In the present international situation ... such a meeting would be quite impossible . What aboutyour United Nations ? . You know about the United Nations ? . We 've been monitoring your radio broadcasts ... for a good manyyears . That 's how we learned your languages . I 'm sureyou recognize from our broadcasts ... the evil forces that have produced ... the trouble in ourworld . Now , surely- - I 'm not concerned , Mr. Harley ... with the internal affairs ofyour planet . Mymission here ... is not to solve yourpettysquabbles . It concerns the existence ... of every last creature on Earth . Well , perhaps ifyou could explain a little- - I intend to explain ... to all the nations at the same time . How do we proceed , Mr. Harley ? . Well , we could call a special meeting ... ofthe General Assembly . But , of course , the United Nations ... doesn 't represent all the nations . Then I suggest a meeting ofall the chiefs ofstate . Believe me , you don 't understand . Theywouldn 't sit down at the same table . I don 't want to resort to threats , Mr. Harley . I merely tell you ... that the future of your planet is at stake . I urge thatyou transmit that message ... to the nations ofthe Earth . I will make that recommendation to the president . But I must tell you in all honesty ... I 'm extremely dubious about the results . Apparently , I 'm not as cynical ... about Earth 's people as you are . I 've been dealing in Earth 's politics ... a good deal longer than you have . Good night , sir . It is now 2 A.M. And the giant robot still hasn 't moved . Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir ... have failed to budge him ... and metallurgical experts have found his huge body impregnable . They 're now concentrating on the ship itself . So far , with no results . Getting anyplace , Sergeant ? . Oh , no , sir . Just beats me , sir . I saw the ramp come through the side ofthe ship here . Now I can 't even find a crack . Oh , Carlsen , what 's the report ? . No luck , sir . We 've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill . What about him ? . Made out ofthe same stuff . Has he moved , Sergeant ? . No , sir , not an inch . This is the toughest material I ever saw , General . For hardness and strength , it 's out ofthis world . I can tell you officially that 's where it came from . The skeletal structure is completely normal . The tests show the same for the major organs- - heart , liver , spleen , kidneys . And the lungs are the same as ours . That must mean a similar atmosphere ... a similar pressure . How old doyou think he is ? . Oh , I 'd say 35 , 38 . Told me this morning when I was examining him . He 's 78 . I don 't believe it . Life expectancy 's 1 30 . How does he explain that ? . Says their medicine is that much more advanced . He was very nice about it ... but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor . I removed the bullet from that man 's arm yesterday . What about it ? . I just examined the wound and it 's completely healed . What does he say about it ? . He put some salve on it , some stuffhe had with him . What areyou going to do with it ? . Take it downstairs and have it analyzed . And I don 't know whether to just get drunk ... or give up the practice of medicine . Afternoon , Mr. Harley . Good afternoon , gentlemen . [ Knocks ] Good afternoon . I 'm glad to see you up and around . Thankyou . Have you any news ? . Not very good news , I 'm afraid . The president accepted your suggestion ... and cabled the invitations for a meeting . Let me read you some ofthe replies . " The Premier wishes to inform ... " the government ofthe United States ... " that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting ... " suggested by the president ... unless the meeting is held in Moscow . " " The suggestion ofthe president regarding a meeting in Moscow ... " would be unacceptable to his Majesty 's government ... " at the present time . Representation could be sent ... only ifthe meeting were held in Washington . " Well , thereyou have it . Now thatyou understand the situation more clearly ... perhaps you 'd like to discuss it with the president . I will not speakwith any one nation or group . I don 't intend to add my contribution ... toyour childish jealousies and suspicions . Our problems are very complex , Klaatu . You mustn 'tjudge us too harshly . I can judge only bywhat I see . Your impatience is quite understandable . I 'm impatientwith stupidity . My people have learned to live without it . I 'm afraid my people haven 't . I 'm very sorry . I wish it were otherwise . Before making any decisions ... I think I should get out among your people ... become familiarwith the basis ... for these strange , unreasoning attitudes . Under the circumstances ... I 'm afraid that 's impossible . I must askyou don 't attempt to leave the hospital . Our military people have insisted on this . I 'm sureyou understand . [ Door Locks ] [ Door Opens ] Captain , sir , the man from the spaceship got away ! What ? . Get every available man ! Yes , sir . Radio : The authorities at Walter Reed Hospital ... refuse to comment on how he managed to escape ... and what measures may be taken to apprehend ... 2nd Radio : ... denounced this rumor ... by Police ChiefWalter Baxter . He 's not 8 feet tall as reported ... nor does he have tentacles ... 3rd Radio : There 's no denying there 's a monster at large ... that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power . The public is advised to take ordinary precautions ... and to remain calm as we await further ... this ship and its occupants come from some other planet . Thus far , scientists have refused to speak efficiently ... on just which planet ... until they 've had an opportunity to study the ship . They seem to agree however that either Venus or Mars ... is the most likely possibility . Not only are these the closest planets to Earth . But all research to date indicates ... that they are the only 2 planets ... capable ofsustaining life as we know it . However , all reputable scientists warn against ... jumping to hasty conclusions . Professor Havermeyer ofM . I. T , for example ... points out that it is entirely possible ... in light of our meager knowledge ... TV : . The president has urged al I citizens ... to be on the alert for any information about this man ... and to transmit such information immediately ... to the police , the army , or the FBI . While the president made no effort to minimize the crisis ... he urged people all over the country ... to remain calm , and I might add ... that though this man may be our bitter enemy ... he could be also a newfound friend . Unfortunately for identification purposes ... Mom , you think I could- - Hey , who 's that ? . TV : The president said the entire facilities ... of the FBI and every other federal agency ... are being brought to bear . He pointed out , however ... that this is no ordinary manhunt . He warned we may be up against powers ... that are beyond our control ... What is it you want ? . My name is Carpenter . I ' m looking for a room . Oh , I see . Are you an FBI man ? . No , I 'm afraid not . I bet he is , Mom . I bet he 's looking for the spaceman . I thinkwe 've been hearing too much about space men . This is Mrs. Benson , Mr. Carpenter . How doyou do ? . And little Bobby . Mr. And Mrs. Barley and Mr. Krull . Man : How doyou do ? . I 'm Mrs. Crockett . I have a very nice room on the second floor . It has 2 large windows and gets the sun all day long . Hey , mister , can I help you look for the spaceman ? . I know just what he looks like . He 's got a big square head with 3 great big eyes ! That 's enough , Bobby . It 's late . Come on . Excuse me . We mustn 't annoy Mr. Carpenter ... or he won 't want to stay here . He 's really a dear little boy and quiet as a mouse . You 're a long way from home , aren 'tyou , Mr. Carpenter ? . How did you know ? . Oh , I can tell a New England accent a mile away . Radio : . And now we takeyou to Miami Beach , Florida ... for a report from Gabriel Heater . Mr. Heater . Heater : . And now on this Sunday morning , we ask some questions ... that have been haunting the nation for 2 whole days . This creature--where is he ? . What is he up to ? . Ifhe can build a spaceship that can fly to Earth ... and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns ... what other terrors can he unleash at will ? . Obviously the monster must be found . He must be tracked down like a wild animal . He must be destroyed . But where would such a creature hide ? . Would he disappear into the north woods ? Would he crawl into the sewers in some great city ? Everybody agrees . There is grave danger . The question remains ... what can we do to protect ourselves ? What measures can we take ... to neutralize this menace from another world ? Destroy it ? Of course ! But how ? And ifwe do destroy it , what do we face in retaliation ? George , would you turn that radio off ? . I ' m trying to concentrate . Why doesn 't the government do something ? . That 's what I 'd like to know . What can they do ? . They 're only people just like us . People , my foot . They 're Democrats . It 's enough to giveyou the shakes . He 's got that robot standing there 8 feet tall ... just waiting for orders to destroy us . This spaceman orwhatever he is . We automatically assume he 's a menace . Maybe he isn 't at all . Then why doesn 't he come out in the open ? . Yeah , like that Heater fella says . What 's he up to ? . Maybe he 's afraid . He 's afraid ? . He was shot the minute he landed here . I was just wondering what I would do . Perhaps before deciding on a course of action ... you 'd want to know more about the people here . To orientyourselfin a strange environment . There 's nothing strange about Washington , Mr. Carpenter . A person from another planet might disagree with you . Ifyou want my opinion ... he comes from right here on Earth . And you know where I mean . Theywouldn 't come in a spaceship . They 'd come in airplanes . I wouldn 't be too sure about that . Stands to reason that fella wants something ... or he wouldn 't be here . That right , Mr. Carpenter ? . I must admit , I 'm a little confused . Mrs. Benson , Mr. Stevens is here to seeyou . Thankyou . Excuse me . George , finish your coffee . I promised the Carsons I 'd be there at 1 1 : 00 . Good morning . Good morning . We 're all set . I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car . The radio 's still on the blink ... so we can forget about the spaceman for today . One thing , I haven 't anyone to staywith Bobby . I don 't suppose we can take him with us ? . Well ... Well , we could . There 's always someone here , but today they 've got plans . Klaatu : I haven 't anyplans . I 'd be happy to spend the day with him ifyou 'd let me . Say , that would be great . Wouldn 't it ? . It 's awfully nice ofyou to suggest it . I 'm sorry . Mr. Carpenter , this is Tom Stevens . How doyou do , Mr. Carpenter ? . Hello . Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon . We talked and listened to the radio . I thought today he might like to show me around the city . Well ... Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it ? . Fine . Think it 's all right ? . Sure . Bobby : That 's myfather . He was killedatAnzio . Did all those people die in wars ? . Most of them . Didn 't you ever hear ofthe Arlington Cemetery ? . No , I 'm afraid not . You don 't seem to know much about anything , doyou ? . Well , I 'll tell you , Bobby , I 've been away a long time . Very far away . Is it different whereyou 've been ? . Don 't they have places like this ? . They have cemeteries , but not like this one . You see , they don 't have anywars . Gee , that 's a good idea . What would you like to do this afternoon ? . Go to the movies . All right . No foolin ' ? . No foolin ' . Bobby , tell me ... doyou have to have money to go there ? . I 've got $ 2.00 . Mom gave it to me . No . I want to takeyou to the movie . Doyou think they 'd accept these ? . Gee , they look like diamonds . In some places , those are what people use for money . They 're easy to carry and they don 't wear out . I bet they 're worth a million dollars . Would you give meyour $ 2.00 for 2 ofthese ? . Well ... sure . Ok . Let 's not say anything to mom about this , though . Why not , Bobby ? . She doesn 't like me to steal from people . Those are great words . He must have been a great man . Well , sure . That 's the kind of man I 'd like to talk to . Bobby , who 's the greatest man in America today ? . I don 't know . Spaceman , I guess . No , I was speaking of earthmen . I meant the greatest philosopher ... the greatest thinker . Oh , you mean the smartest man ... in the whole world . Yes , that would do nicely . Professor Barnhardt , I guess . He 's the greatest scientist in the whole world . He lives right here in Washington , doesn 't he ? . Right nearwhere my mom works . Where 's that ? . Department ofCommerce . She 's a secretary . That man they call the Secretary isn 't at all . My mom 's a real secretary . Mr. Carpenter , now can we go see the spaceship ? . Ifyou like . I bet that iron guy 's strong . I bet he could knock down a whole building . I shouldn 't be at all surprised . I 'd like to get inside that ship ... see how it works . What doyou think makes it go ? . Well , a highly developed form ofatomic power ... I should imagine . I thought that was only for bombs . No . No , it 's for lots of other things , too . You think it could go faster than the F-86 ? . Yes , I should think so . About a thousand miles an hour ? . Maybe 4,000 miles an hour ... and outside the Earth 's atmosphere ... a good deal faster . How could they make a landing ? . Well , there are several ways to reduce landing speed . You see the basic problem ... is to overcome the inertia and- - Keep going , mister , he was fallin ' for it . Thankyou , Mrs. Robinson . I 'm sure we 've all shared your fears ... during the past few days . I see a gentleman here with his little boy . What doyou think ofthe spaceship , son ? . It 's the biggest spaceship I ever saw . Ha ha ha . And you , sir , mind telling us your name ? . My name is Carpenter . Would you care to say a few words , Mr. Carpenter ? . I supposeyou 're just as scared as the rest of us . In a different way , perhaps . I am fearful when I see people substituting fear for reason . In fact , I would like- - Uh , thankyou , Mr. Carpenter . Thank--Thankyou very much . I see another gentleman over here in the crowd . Extra ! Extra ! Spaceman eludes police ! Army put in charge ! Read all about it ! Spaceman eludes police ! Extra ! Extra ! Getyourpaper here ! Armyput in charge ! Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it ! You think they 'll ever find him ? . I don 't know , Bobby . I 'm inclined to doubt it . Mr. Carpenter , what does " inertia " mean ? . Inertia is the property of matter ... bywhich it remains in uniform motion ... unless acted upon by external force . Oh . I 'll bet that 's just the way Professor Barnhardt talks . Bobby , I have an idea . Let 's go and see Professor Barnhardt ... and find out how he talks . You 're kidding , aren 'tyou ? . Wouldn 'tyou like to meet him ? . Sure , I would , but ... Ah , I betyou 'd be scared . Maybe we can scare him more than he can scare us . I likeyou , Mr. Carpenter . You 're a real screwball . Extra ! Extra ! Spaceman still at large ! Extra ! Readall about it ! Getyourpaper here ! [ Rings Doorbell ] [ Ring ] Maybe he isn 't home . Gee , I bet you this is where he works . What 's that stuff on the blackboard mean ? . It 's a problem in celestial mechanics . I 'll bet he 's the only one in the world ... that knows the answer . He doesn 't know the answer ... and he 'll never get it that way . We probably couldn 't get to see him even ifhe was home . Hey , where areyou goin ' ? . Ifhe 's that difficult to see ... perhaps we ought to leave a calling card . Did he do it wrong ? . He just needs a little help . What areyou doing in here ? How dareyou write on that blackboard . Doyou realize ... the professor 's been working on that problem ... forweeks ? . He 'll solve it in no time now . How did you get in here , and what doyou want ? . We came to see Professor Barnhardt . Well , he 's not here ... and he won 't be back till this evening . I thinkyou 'd better leave now . Would you give this to the professor ? . I think he 'll want to talk to me . I wouldn 't erase that . The professor needs it very badly . [ Rings Doorbell ] Mr. Carpenter come home yet ? . Yeah . He 's right inside . Tell him I 'd like to see him . Ok . Come on in . Your name Carpenter ? . Yes . Oh , I suppose ... Professor Barnhardt 's been looking for me . I 've been looking foryou all afternoon . Thankyou . It was a wonderful day . You still haven 't answered my question . You know how I feel , Tom . But I just want to think it over . The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow . Ifl could tell him that I was getting married ... and had 2 dependents ... You 're a good salesman . But I 've got to think about it . A good insurance salesman ... wouldn 't giveyou time to think about it . Good night . Good night . Oh , hiya , Mom . Hello , darling . Good evening , Mr. Carpenter . Good evening . Uh , Mrs. Benson , this is Mr. Brady . - How doyou do ? . - How doyou do ? . Mr. Brady 's a government agent . Have a nice day , dear ? . We had a swell time . Didn 't we , Mr. Carpenter ? . Yes , we did . We went to the movies and had some ice cream cones ... and then we went to see daddy . I don 't know how to thankyou . I enjoyed every minute of it . We better get going , Mr. Carpenter . Aw , gee . You didn 't finish your story . I 'll finish it tomorrow . Good night , Bobby . Good night . Good night . Come on , dear . Time to go to bed . Why did Mr. Carpenter have to go with Mr. Brady ? . I don 't know . Maybe it was a mistake . Oh . We sure had fun today . We saw the spaceship ... and we went to see Professor Barnhardt . Professor Barnhardt ? . Yeah , sure . Mom , do I have to go to school tomorrow ? . Yes , of course , dear . Gee . I was hoping I could go out ... with Mr. Carpenter again . [ Doorbell Rings ] Oh , come in . The professor 's in his study . Thankyou . [ Knocks On Door ] [ Knocks Louder ] This is the man you wanted to see , Professor . Thankyou , Captain . I 'll wait outside . You wrote this ? . It was a clumsyway to introduce myself ... but I understand you 're a difficult man to see . I thoughtyou 'd have the solution by this time . Notyet . That 's why I wanted to seeyou . All you have to do now is to substitute ... this expression at this point . Yes , that will reproduce the first altered term ... but what about the effect ofthe other terms ? . Almost negligible . With variation of parameters ... this is the answer . How can you be so sure ? . Haveyou tested this theory ? I find it works well enough ... to get me from one planet to another . I am Klaatu . I spent 2 days at your Walter Reed Hospital . Room 309 . My doctor 's name was Major White . And ifyou 're not interested ... or ifyou intend to turn me over to your army ... we needn 't waste any more time . You may go now , Captain . Please thank General Cutler ... and tell him ... tell him that I know this gentleman . You have faith , Professor Barnhardt . It isn 't faith that makes good science , Mr. Klaatu . It 's curiosity . Sit down , please . There are several thousand questions ... I 'd like to askyou . I would like to explain something of my mission here . That was my first question . We know from scientific observation ... thatyour planet has discovered ... a rudimentary kind ofatomic energy . We also know thatyou 're experimenting with rockets . Yes . That is true . So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves ... with your primitive tanks and aircraft ... we were unconcerned . But soon , one ofyour nations ... will apply atomic energy to spaceships . That will create a threat to the peace and security ... of other planets . That , of course , we cannot tolerate . What exactly is the nature ofyour mission , Mr. Klaatu ? . I came here to warn you that by threatening danger ... your planet faces danger . Verygrave danger . I 'm prepared , however , to offer a solution . Would you care to be more specific ? . What I have to say must be said to all concerned . It is too important to be entrusted to any individual . I gather that your efforts on the official level ... were not entirely successful . I come to you as a last resort ... and I confess my patience is wearing thin . Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing ? . What--What sort of action doyou mean ? . Violent action , since that seems to be ... the only thing your people understand . Leveling New York City perhaps ? . Or sinking the Rock ofGibraltar ? . Would you be willing to meet with a group ofscientists ... I 'm calling together ? . Perhaps you could explain your mission to them ... and they , in turn ... could present it to theirvarious peoples . That 's why I came to seeyou . It is not enough to have men ofscience . We scientists are too often ignored or misunderstood . We must get leaders from every field ... the finest minds in the world . I leave that in your hands . One thing , Mr. Klaatu . Suppose this group should rejectyour proposals . What is the alternative ? . I 'm afraid there is no alternative . In such a case ... the planet Earth would have to be ... eliminated . Such a power exists ? . I assureyou , such power exists . The people who come to the meeting ... must be made to realize this . They must understand what is at stake . You mentioned a demonstration offorce . Yes . Would such a demonstration ... be possible before the meeting ? . Yes , of course . Something that will dramatize ... for them and for their people ... the seriousness ofthe situation . Something that would affect the entire planet . That can easily be arranged . I wouldn 't wantyou to harm anybody ... or destroy anything . Why don 'tyou leave it to me ? . I 'll think of something . Maybe ... a little demonstration . Something dramatic but not destructive . That 's quite an interesting problem . Would the day after tomorrow be all right ? . Say , about noon ? . Radio : ... have actuallybeen no further developments ... but police and the FBI are tracing everypossible clue ... and rounding up all possible suspects . Rum my ! Oh , my . Did it agai n . T ake a hand , Mr. Carpenter ? . Take a- - Oh . No , thanks . We d- - No , thanks . Are you going out , dear ? . Yes . Tom 's picking me up . Well , personally ... I wouldn 't go out after dark these days ... but , uh , then I 'm not courting , am I ? . Ohh . Oh , Mr. Carpenter . Everyone seems so ... " Jittery " is the word . Bobby 's the only person I know who isn 't ... jittery . Well , he has his homework to keep him occupied . He 's a fine boy , Mrs. Benson . Naturally , I think so . Warm , friendly , intelligent . Mr. Carpenter ... this is none of my business ... but why did that man come here last night ? . Oh , theyjust wanted to ask me a few questions . Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt ... in the afternoon , and he wasn 't in . Apparently , they thought ... I was looking for secrets of some kind . [ Doorbell Rings ] Excuse me . [ Music Box Plays ] Helen : Hello . Tom : Hello . Are you ready ? . I will be in a minute . Picture starts at 8 : 50 . I was just talking to Mr. Carpenter . Well , I hope Mr. Carpenter won 't think I 'm intruding . - Shh . - What ? . Good evening . Excuse me . I was just going up to my room . Good night , Mr. Carpenter . Have a good time , both ofyou . Thankyou . Thankyou . Why don 'tyou wait in here while I get my things ? . Tom , that was awful . I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm just tired ... ofhearing about Mr. Carpenter . I don 't like the way he 's attached himself ... toyou and Bobby . After all , what doyou know about him ? . I 'll go get my things . All you have to remember ... is first find the common denominator ... and then divide . Thanks , Mr. Carpenter . I 'll say good night again . Mr. Carpenter ... I ... Good night . Good night , Mrs. Benson . Go to bed now , darling . You can finish that in the morning . Ok . Bobby ... I think it would be better ... ifwe didn 't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter . Gee , why , Mom ? . He 's my best friend ... and he 's awful good in arithmetic . He even helps Professor Barnhardt . Did you and Mr. Carpenter ... really go see Professor Barnhardt ? . Sure we did . He wasn 't there , but we went to see him ... and Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic . Mom ? . Something wrong with Mr. Carpenter ? . What doyou mean , dear ? . On account oflast night . You think he 's a bank robber or a gangster maybe ? . No , dear , of course not . He 's a very nice man . I just think that he might prefer ... to be left alone , that 's all . Now , you go to bed and forget about it . Good night , darling . Good night . Hey , Mom ? Whywould he want to be left alone ? . Don 't forget to brush your teeth . [ Train Whistle Blows ] Bobby , have you a flashlight ? . Yeah . It 's a real boy scout one . Fine . Here . All you got to do is push up on it , see ? . Oh . What doyou need it for ? . I--um ... The lights in my room went out . Oh . I must tell you sometime about another kind oftrain ... the kind that doesn 't need any tracks . - Really ? . - Really . Remind me in the morning . I 'll tell you all about them . Ok . [ Door Closes ] No tracks ? . Gort berenga . [ Speaking Alien Language ] Helen : Come in for a minute . Bobby , what areyou doing up at this hour ? I couldn 't sleep , Mom . I had to tell you . Tell me what ? . Well , afteryou left , I followed Mr. Carpenter ... and where do you think he went ? . Right into the spaceship . Now , Bobby , wait a minute . Honest , Mom , I saw him . It opened up , and he walked right in . And that big iron fella was walkin ' around , too . Bobby , you 've been dreaming again . No , I haven 't , Mom . Honest , I promiseyou , I saw him . Where 'd you see all this , Bobby ? . On the lawn , down at the mall ... in that place with the soldiers out in front . Where were the soldiers all this time ? . That big iron guy grabbed them and knocked them out . I like Mr. Carpenter , Mom . I 'm kind of scared . Now , don 't be frightened , darling . It was only a bad dream . Here , we 'll prove it toyou . Tom , will you ask Mr. Carpenter ... to come down for a minute ? . Sure . He 's in the room next to mine . Ok . Now , think back hard . You didn 't follow ... Mr. Carpenter at all , did you ? . You haven 't even been out ofthe house . Yes , I have ! Now , you didn 't really see a spaceship ... butyou thoughtyou did . I 'd never call you a liar . He 's not there , but ... Iookwhat I found in his room . Is it real ? . Well , it looks real to me . Mr. Carpenter 's got lots of diamonds . He gave me a couple ofthem . He gave these toyou ? . Well , no , not exactly . I gave him $ 2.00 . This doesn 't make sense . I think the guy 's a crook . I never did trust him . Gee , Mom , you think maybe ... he 's a diamond smuggler ? . Come on , darling , you 're going up to bed now . I wonder ifwe ought to call- - Bobby and I have had enough excitement for the night . Doyou think it 's all right foryou to stay here ? . I 've got a good lock on my door . Bobby 's gonna sleep in my room tonight . Ok . Come on now . Up to bed with you . Bobby , your shoes are soaking . Yeah . Grass was kind ofwet . I 'm going now , Helen . All right . [ Door Closes ] [ Gasps ] Hello . May I seeyou for a minute ? . Well , I 'm just going to lunch . May I walk outwith you ? . - Well- - - [ Telephone Rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Mrs. Benson speaking . Oh , hello . I 'm at Bleecker 's ... to get an appraisal on that diamond . I thought we might have lunch together . Can I talk toyou later ? . Oh , that 'll be fine . Bye . I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school . Yes ? . I 'd like to know what he told you last night . Oh , I really didn 't pay much attention . Bobby has such an active imagination . Did you believe what he told you ? . I have a reason for asking this- - a very important reason . There 's another elevator we can use . What is ityou want ? . Before I askyou to be honest with me ... perhaps I should be ... completely honest with you . What happened ? . What time is it ? . Just 1 2 : 00 . We shall be here for a little while- - about 30 minutes . Well , we can try pushing the other buttons . Theywon 'twork . Why not ? . You see , the electricity has been neutralized- - all over the world . Bobbywas telling the truth , wasn 't he ? . Yes . It 's that spaceman . That 's what it is . [ Speaking French ] [ Speaking Russian ] You should see it , Professor Barnhardt . You should go out and see it foryourself . Thanks . I am enjoying it right here . The whole city has stopped . People are running around like ants . What a brilliant idea . I neverwould 've thought ofit . What about the people who are coming ... to the meeting tonight ? . Have they all arrived ? . Yes . Here 's the list ... and I talked to most ofthem ... on the phone this morning . They 're all very curious about the meeting . Good . Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter ? . He 'll be there at 8 : 30 . Tell me , Hilda . Does all this frighten you ? . Does it makeyou feel insecure ? . Yes , sir , it certainly does . That 's good , Hilda . I 'm glad . As far as we can tell ... all power has been cut off everywhere ... with a few exceptions ... and even these exceptions are remarkable- - hospitals ... planes in flight ... that sort ofthing . I wish I could giveyou more information ... but as you know , all communications are out- - telephones , radio ... cable ... everything . Gentlemen ... I can tell you the president is prepared ... to declare a state of national emergency . Oh , did you call the electrician ? . I tried , Mr. Bleecker ... but the phone doesn 't work , either . Well , call the phone company . But the phone doesn 't work . Is it worth anything ? . I have never seen such a stone in all my life . Will you please tell me where it came from ? . That 's what I wantyou to tell me . But there are no diamonds like this ... any place in theworld that I know of . Areyou sure ofthat ? . Would you like to sell it ? . No . No , thanks . I 'd giveyou a very good price . Thankyou , no . I 've already told you ... more than I told Professor Barnhardt ... because , in a sense , my life is in your hands . I thought ifyou knew the facts ... you 'd appreciate the importance ... of my not being apprehended ... before the meeting tonight . Of course . Of course I do . You hold great hope for this meeting ? . I can see no other hope foryour planet . Ifthis meeting should fail ... then I 'm afraid there is no hope . It must be 1 2 : 30 . Yes ... just exactly . [ Car Horns Honking ] Where areyou going now ? . Back to the boarding house . I 'll be safe there for the afternoon . I can keep an eye on Bobby . He 's the only other person ... who knows anything about- - No , wait a minute . There 's someone else . Who ? . Tom . He was there last night ... when Bobby told me what he saw . Doyou think he 'd tell anyone ? . Well , I think he 'd talk to me first , anyway , before ... Oh , we can 't take any chance . I 'll get in touch with him right away to make sure . But I 've got to talk to him . It 's terribly important . When is he coming back ? . I don 't know , Mrs. Benson . He left before noon- - before that awful electric business . I 'm scared to death , Mrs. Benson . I- - No . He wouldn 't tell me where he was going . Said it was something personal . Please ask him to call me the minute he gets in . Thanks . Beforewe start discussing plans ... Beforewe start discussing plans ... I want a report from Colonel Ryder . What about the robot , Colonel ? . When it was discovered last night ... that the robot had moved ... I was directed by the Joint Chiefs ... to find a means ofimmobilizing him . We accomplished that this morning ... by encasing him in a block of KL-93 . It 's a new plastic material strongerthan steel . Isn 't it possible he 's broken out ofthis stuff ? . No , sir . We 've just checked on that . He 's locked up tight as a drum . All right . That means we concentrate on the man . Up till now , we 've agreed upon ... the desirability of capturing this man alive . We can no longer afford to be so particular . We 'll get him , alive ifpossible ... butwe must get him . Is that clear ? . Honest , Mary , I 'm so scared , I can 't sit still . I 'd like to run someplace ... but I don 't know where to go . Bye , now . Margaret , call the Pentagon . Find out who 's in charge ofthis spaceman business . Whoever it is , I want to talk to him . Mrs. Benson 's been trying to getyou . She says it 's important . Get this other call first . Oh , Mrs. Benson , he just walked in . Oh , fine . Areyou nervous , too ? . Yes , I am , Margaret . Helen , come on in . Tom , I 've been trying to getyou all afternoon . I have terrific news about Mr. Carpenter . What about him ? . He 's the man from the spaceship . I had that diamond checked at 3 different places . Nobody 's ever seen a stone like that . Afterwhat Bobby told us , that 's enough for me . Why is it nobody knows anything about him ? . Why hasn 't he got any money ? . All right , Tom . It 's true . I know it 's true . How doyou know ? . Never mind about that . You 've got to promiseyou won 't say a word to anybody . Are you crazy ? . Afterwhat happened today ? . But you don 't understand . You don 't realize how important this is . Of course it 's important . We can do something about it . We mustn 't do anything about it . Believe me , I know what I 'm talking about . He 's a menace to the whole world . It 's our duty to turn him in . But he isn 't a menace . He told me why he came here . He told you ? . Oh , don 't be silly , honey , just becauseyou like the guy . You realize , of course , what this would mean to us ? . I could write my own ticket . I 'd be the biggest man in the country . Is that what you 're thinking about ? . Why not ? . Somebody 's got to get rid ofhim . [ Telephone Rings ] I 'm not going to let you do it . This is the most important thing in the world . What 's his name , Margaret ? . General Cutler . Yes . All right . I 'll hold on . You mustn 't . You don 't know whatyou 're doing . It isn 't justyou and Mr. Carpenter . The rest ofthe world is involved . I don 't care about the rest ofthe world . You 'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers . I feel different right now . You 're gonna marry a big hero . I 'm not going to marry anybody . Helen , I- - Hello , General Cutler ? . No , I don 't want to speak to his aide . I want to speak to the general . Tell him it 's about the spaceman . That 's right , General . That 's where he 's staying . Yes . Of course I 'm sure . Thankyou very much , Mr. Stevens . I want to talk toyou further ... but I haven 't time now . Deploy all Zone 5 units according to plan B ... immediately . [ Jeep Horn Honks ] Hello , Mrs. Benson . Hello , Sammy . Attention , all units . Attention , all units . When deployed according to plan " Baker , " maintain station and remain on radio alert ... until further orders . I 'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me ... until the meeting . Where 's the meeting going to be ? . At the ship . Yeah . They got in a taxicab ... and went off down that street . Thankyou , son . Attention , Zone 5 . Attention , Zone 5 . Yellow cab moving north on 1 4th Street ... from Harvard Street . Man and woman in back seat . Get license number and report . That 's the one . Right . Attention , Zone 5 . License number of target vehicle is H001 2 . Looks like something big 's going on . Attention , Zone 5 . Attention , Zone 5 . Report when target vehicle passes your position . It 's only a few blocks to Barnhardt 's . I 'm worried about Gort . I 'm afraid ofwhat he might do ... if anything should happen to me . Gort ? . But he 's a robot . Withoutyou , what could he do ? . There 's no limit to what he could do . He could destroy the Earth . If anything should happen to me ... you must go to Gort . You must say these words ... Klaatu barada nikto . Please repeat that . Klaatu barada nikto . You must remember those words . Yellow cab , license number H001 2 ... heading west on 1 5th Street at Treasury Place . The target vehicle is turning west ... into Massachusetts Avenue . Yellow cab heading northwest at Columbia Road and Connecticut . Repeat . Yellow cab heading northwest ... at Columbia Road and Connecticut . Attention , all units , northwest area , Zone 5 . Block off all streets intersecting ... Connecticut Avenue ... on a line from Wisconsin to the park . All vehicles close in . Let 's go . Say , what 's going on here ? . Driver ... [ Gunshot ] Get that message to Gort ... right away . [ Jeep Horn Honks ] Captain , move these people back . Yes , sir . See if they have a stretcher ... at the police station . Take him there . Aah ! Gort ... Klaatu barada nikto . Klaatu barada nikto . Yes , sir . We have the body here now , locked in a cell . There 's no question about it , General . He 's dead , all right . I understand . I 'll be right there , sir . Bring in a squad of men , Lieutenant . Place a guard around that cell . Captain , don 't let anyone in or out ofthe building . Yes , sir . Come along . [ Machine Hums ] Professor Barnhardt ? . Yes . I 'm very sorry , but I have to askyou ... to call offthis meeting . Call it off ? . But I had permission from the army . I knowyou did , sir . But the robot 's on the loose , and it 's not safe around here . You 'll have to get your people out ofthis area . [ Modulation Increases ] [ Grows Louder ] [ Machine Shuts Off ] Hello . I thoughtyou were ... I was . You mean ... he has the power oflife and death ? . No . That power is reserved to the Almighty spirit . This technique , in some cases ... can restore life for a limited period . But ... how long ? . You mean how long will I live ? . That no one can tell . Under the circumstances ... the army people have asked us to leave ... and since their concern is for our safety ... I can do nothing but suggest that we comply . I am leaving soon . And you will forgive me ifl speak bluntly . The universe grows smaller every day ... and the threat ofaggression by any group anywhere ... can no longer be tolerated . There must be security for all ... or no one is secure . Now , this does not mean giving up any freedom ... except the freedom to act irresponsibly . Your ancestors knew this ... when they made laws to govern themselves ... and hired policemen to enforce them . We of the other planets have long accepted this principle . We have an organization ... for the mutual protection of all planets ... and for the complete elimination ofaggression . The test ofany such higher authority ... is , of course , the police force that supports it . For our policemen , we created a race of robots . Their function is to patrol the planets ... in spaceships like this one ... and preserve the peace . In matters ofaggression ... we have given them absolute power over us . This power cannot be revoked . At the first sign ofviolence ... they act automatically against the aggressor . The penalty forprovoking their action ... is too terrible to risk . The result is we live in peace ... without arms or armies ... secure in the knowledge ... that we are free from aggression and war- - free to pursue more profitable enterprises . We do not pretend to have achieved perfection ... but we do have a system , and it works . I came here to give you these facts . It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet . But ifyou threaten to extend yourviolence ... this Earth ofyours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder . Your choice is simple . Join us and live in peace ... or pursueyour present course and face obliteration . We shall be waiting foryour answer . The decision rests with you . Gort berenga .

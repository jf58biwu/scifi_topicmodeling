 [ MUSIC PLAYING ] NARRATOR : This is the jungle . The vast wilderness of giant , lush foliage ... Of tropical birds and fierce animal life ... the killer tiger ... the cunning hyena ... the deadly python that can crush a giant elk ... the proud lion ... A fierce lioness stalking her pray to feed her young . And the buzzards ... the scavengers of the jungle . Soaring lower , ever lower , eager to devour the dead or the dying . Kill or be killed ... this is the law of the jungle . And here ... what have we here ? Who are these men , and what could they possibly be doing in this cruel , tropical wilderness ?

Cola-Cola ? Sounds like a commercial for some bubble water ... ha-ha . How did we get here ? Some of our men found you lying in the jungle and carried you here . Yeah , what do we owe 'em for carrying charges ? [ LAUGHS ] Get it ... carrying charges ... funny line ... Let 's laugh it up here , lady . Oh ... Come here . How did you get lost in the jungle ? Well we were on our way to do a show for the boys in Guam . We were in a plane high over the Pacific . Sammy goes to look for the powder room , and he couldn 't find it . I went there to show him . I walked through the wrong door ... like a dope he follows me . Yeah ... lucky thing we had our parachutes . There we were ... lost in a vast wilderness . We lived on wild berries and raw fish .

Saloma needs glasses . You eat . I don 't wanna eat , thank you . You eat . No , I told you I don 't want to eat . Hey Dukie , I gotta get away from this blimp or she 'll kill me . Well you asked for it . I got it . When locked in a corner , do a routine . Go . Great . You eat . Oh , that 's what I get for ... please ... Would you let go of my shirt ? What are you trying to feed me for ? You 're not my mother . You can 't feed me . Saloma ! [ SPEAKING NATIVE TRIBAL LANGUAGE ] . Aw ! [ SPEAKING NATIVE TRIBAL LANGUAGE ] After all , I 've been eating for a long time . I know how to feed myself . I 've been feeding myself ever since I was a little boy . Do you understand ? [ DRUM MUSIC ] Oh , well good evening , ladies and gentlemen . And welcome to showtime at the Royal Tiasian . And what a wonderful show we have lined up for you tonight .

You sure have a beautiful place to live in . I 've heard about places like this . Read about them . In fact , I 've even seen them in movies . Never really expected to be here , though . Yes , we have everything here to make us happy ... a calm , peaceful atmosphere . No noisy streetcars or automobiles . No rushing around in and out subways . No smoky factories smudging up the air we breath . Say , how come you know about these things ? And how come you talk like a college girl ? Perhaps it 's because I went to college . Come again ? I was sent to your country to be educated . Someday I will be queen of this island . My people would like their queen to be smart . Well what do you know ? Sammy ! You know , I kinda hate to leave this place . Then why go ? Huh ? Do you have to go ? Well , we 're part of an entertainment group . We 're due to entertain the boys on Guam . In fact , we 're overdo . How do we get off this island ? Do any ships stop here ? Oh yes . A ship stops once every two months . Oh , we 'll have to do better than that . Perhaps Dr. Zabor can help you . Dr. Zabor ? Yes , he 's the only white man on the island . Well how come we haven 't seen him ? Where is he ? He lives on the other side of the island . He 's a scientist working on an experiment in evolution . He 's very clever , and we are in the midst of a series of ... Did you say " we " ? Yes , you see , he hired me as his assistant . Oh . Tomorrow I shall take you to him . He 'll be very glad to see you both , I 'm sure . Oh , great . Hey Duke ... Dukie ... What ? Oh , never mind . He went that away . Run for your lives .

Yeah , wait for me in the glove compartment , will ya ' ? Well ? Well what ? Well aren 't you going to carry me across the threshold ? Get out of here . How much further do we have to go ? Oh , not very much . Boy now I know how Livingston felt when he couldn 't find Stanley . You have that wrong . It 's just visa versa . Visa what ? Visa versa ... Livingston didn 't find Stanley ... Stanley found Livingston . This is visa versa ? That 's right . What are you looking for ? I expect Two-Ton Salami to come out here charging after me at any minute . Oh , don 't worry about that . She won 't . None of my people venture very close to the castle . It is forbidden . Castle ? What castle ? The castle where Dr. Zabor lives and works . Well , how come you go there and work ? I don 't share all the beliefs of my ancestors . Where is this castle ? There it is . Cozy little shack . I wish it was on 42nd Street and Broadway . 42nd and Broadway ? What kind of a crack is that ? Well if it was on 42nd and Broadway , we 'd be standing in front of the Automat . And boy , could I use a good cup of coffee right now . Come on , Duke . Hey-hey-hey ... wait for me . This looks like death not only took a holiday , but he got a hangover from taking it . Oh , this looks like Sing-Sing . I got to get out of here . What are you worried about ? What me ? I ain 't worried . Just wish I was back in Brooklyn playing the Loew 's Pitkin , that 's all . Good morning , Chulak . Morning . Tell Dr. Zabor I am here , and I bring two white visitors . I tell master . Close the door . Close the door . Close the door . Oh , that 's me . Master ... no what is it , Chula ? Why do you disturb me ? The girl ... she is here . Since when does she have to be announced ? She has two men with her ... white men . White men ? Who are they ? I not know , Master . Come on , Dukie , let 's go . The doctor 's probably busy . And besides , I forgot something at the hut . What ? I forgot to stay there . I 'm getting out of here . Relax cuckoo you want to get off this island , don 't you ? Sure , I want to get off the island . Well the Doctor 's going to help us get off ... isn 't he ? Yes , Dr. Zabor 's a very brilliant man . Brilliant man , huh ? Anybody who 'd live in a creep joint like this must be a moronic idiot . Good morning . I 'm Doctor Zabor . Welcome to my creep joint . Oh , gosh , I 'm sorry Mr. Idiot ... I didn 't mean to call your creep joint a creep joint . Ah , think nothing of it . Doctor , I would like you to meet my friends . Yes . Hi-ya , Doc . I 'm Duke Mitchell . This is my partner , Sammy Patrillo . We were on our way to do a thing . Don 't I know you from someplace ? I don 't think so . Psst ... hey Dukie ... come here . I think I know where you know this guy from . Where ? Ain 't this the fellow with the hand and the face ... Biting people on the neck and wearing capes ? You 're crazy . Watch out for bats . Wait a minute ... I 'll prove it you ... watch . Doctor Zabor ? Yes . Would you do me a favor ? What is it ? Make a face . What ? Thanks ... see ... What did I tell you ? No go over and apologize . I ain 't going to do it . Come on , you embarrassed me . Go over and apologize . Come on . Doctor Zabor ? Yes . What do you go around scaring little children for ? What are you doing ? What 's the matter with you ? Don 't mind him , Doc . He thinks you 're the guy that goes around biting little kids on the neck ... you know what I mean ? [ LAUGHING ] It 's him . Doctor , my friends fell out of a plane and landed on the island . They would like to get back to civilization . I told them you could help them . That 's possible . Thank you , Doctor . It may take several days to make arrangements . In the meantime , please , accept my hospitality . Allow me to furnish you with suitable clothes . Gee , thanks Doc ... But no capes , huh ? Oh , Chula ... Yes , Master ? Take these men to my room . Yes , Master . Pick out anything you want from my wardrobe . When you have changed , Chula will bring you to the study . Follow Chula . Come . The most interesting cranium . Strange ... but interesting . You really think so ? Oh , what a charming compliment . It was very thoughtful for you to bring these men here . I 'm sure I can help them . I was hoping you would . I would do anything for you in my power . Please , Doctor Zabor ... I 'll be in the laboratory , Doctor . Why do treat me so cold , my Dear ? Don 't you know I love you ? I want you . Oh , what is wrong ? Why do not accept my love ? Please , Doctor , must we go over that again ? Yes , we must . You shall love me . Certainly nice of you to fix us up like this , Doc . Yeah , I always wanted a Palm Beach suit , thanks . Very happy to do it . It 's quite a drug store you got here , Doc . This is my laboratory . Laboratory ? No kidding . Hey , Duke , look ... looks like the monkey house in the Bronx Zoo , doesn 't it ? Only it 's more , of course . They are my guinea pigs . Guinea pigs ? They look like monkeys to me . They are monkeys ... silly boy . They are so monkeys . Certainly they are monkeys . But they also guinea pigs ... for the reason I use that I use them in my experiments . You understand , yeah ? No . Hey , Doc , what 's this ? Streptococcus . Yeah , no kidding . Hello Strept-eye and Cock-eye ... ha-ha . Don 't mind my friend . He has a one syllable brain . I can see that . What kind of experiments are you making , Doctor ? Oh , I 'm performing a series of experiments in evolution . Evolution ? What 's evolution ? Scientists have proven that all living things originated in a process of evolution . They also know that there is a growth force that tends to make genetic changes physiologically or morphologically . Chimpanzees and gorillas are the highest members of the ape family and are the ancestors of man . Darwin , in his " Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis " assumes that every living cell contains a gemmule , which is a hypothetical granula . I have found the chemical formula that simulates the growth force . But nature takes years . I can , in a matter of hours , make a complete embryonic metamorphosis ... Both physiological and morphological . Do you understand ? Well , uh ... Sure . What ? Yeah . You mean you understood him ? Mhm-hm . What 'd he say ? What 'd he say ? Well he was just trying to say that due to the great lines of Swedium , which have been perplexed by the fact that the last type dog had it 's first origin ... You can 't confuse tyrannical and spasmodic conditions when it is never ... Shut up . Confused as a satellite of inconvenience . Shut up . With physical embryonic physical morphesis and ... methods ... period . Master , Pepe Bordo here to see you . And in conclusion , I 'd like to add that if you took the embryonic metamorphosis , the only thing ... Shut up . What 's she so mad about ? Oh , Ramona isn 't mad . She just wants to play . Come ... I 'll show you . Well , Ramona ... do you like our friends ? Do you want to come out ? No , don 't let her out ... don 't let her out . Oh , Ramona 's a pet . She 's very tame ... watch . All right , Ramona , open the door . Open the door . Open the door , Ramona . That 's a good girl . Come on out now ... come on . That 's a good girl . I want you to meet my friends . Shake hands with Dukie . Shake hands . Hi Ramona . Good girl ... and now I think I want you to kiss Sammy . No , no , no ... get her out of here . Get her ... I don 't want to know . I don 't ... I don 't want to . No , no ... get her out of here . Aw , she won 't hurt you , Sammy . [ LAUGHS ] Hey , you know something Dukie ? What ? She looks a little like our agent , huh ? Yeah . [ LAUGHTER ] Pepe has come for some acid for his batteries , Nona . Very well , doctor . Come on , Ramona ... That 's a good ... Into your cage ... that 's a good little girl . All right , Pepe . Thank you . This is Pepe Bordo . Mr. Mitchell ... Mr. Patrillo ... Hi-ya , Pepe . How are you , Mr. Bordo ? Please to meet you . Ah , Pepe is representing the law on the island . Oh , a cop , huh ? You call them a cop . My friends are from America . How did you get here ? There has been no boat for months . Oh , we just dropped in ... ha-ha . They parachuted from a plane . Oh . Pepe has the only means of outside communication on the island ... a small , wireless outfit . Gee , maybe you can get us off this island while there 's some passing ship or something . Yeah , you know Morris Code - da-da , da-da , da , da , da . What does that mean ? Da-da , da-da , da , da , da . What does that mean ? Well , my transmitter only carries to the neighboring islands ... a little over 100 miles . But some ship my pick her up . I shall try . Well , thanks a lot . Gee , that 'll be peachy . Here you are , Pepe . Oh , thank you . And thank you , too , Doctor . My pleasure . Gentlemen . It has been a pleasure . Same ... [ INTERPOSING VOICES ] And don 't forget ... Da-da , da-da , da , da , da . [ LAUGHTER ] I see you to the door . Wow , it will great if we can get a ship to stop here , won 't it ? Sure will ... sooner the better . Gee , Nona , why didn 't you tell us there was a wireless outfit on this island ? I ... I just didn 't think , I guess . Well , if a ship stops here , we can go right out to Guam . Gee , Honey , what 's the matter ? Nothing . Come on Baby , don 't feel that way . Come on Baby ... smile . It 's getting awful sticky around here . What do you want ? What ... what ... what are you doing ? Ha-ha ... that 's pretty cute , you know . What are you doing ? ( SCREAMING ) Help , Dukie ... Get me out of here . Help Dukie ... Dukie , get me out of here , will ya ? You know something ? I don 't like the way that Doctor Zabor looked at you a couple times today . And do you know something ? I don 't think Doctor Zabor liked the way you looked at me a couple of times tonight , either . Well it 's just too bad . And I don 't know if I like the idea of living here or not . Why not ? Well , it 's too far from the village ... and you . But I 'm there every day . Yeah , but you 're always busy . You can always take me home at night . Well ... I guess that 'll have to do until I can think of something better . I shall have my father invite all of you to dinner some night soon . Would you like that ? I can hardly wait . Anything else , Master ? No ... go to bed . Good night , Master . Good night . Fine thing ... he knows I 'm afraid to be left alone . Well I wouldn 't think of letting you go home alone . I 'll see you home . Well , thank you very much . But wouldn 't Sammy like to come along ? Oh no ... Sammy wouldn 't like to come along . Sammy 's tired . Sammy 's tired ... Sammy 's tired ... How does he know if I 'm tired ? Come to think of it , I am a little tired . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Is that you , Duke ? It 's about time you got home . Lie still ... will you go to sleep . Cut it out , will you ... go to sleep . Hey Duke ... what 's with the angora patch ? Ramona ... how did you get up here ? Come on ... you got to go back to your cage . Come on , Ramona , let 's go . Atta baby , come on . What are you doing with Ramona ? What am I doing with Ramona ? Are you kidding ? I 'm upstairs sleeping in my own bed ... and very peacefully , mind you . The next thing I know this is staring me right in the kisser . The whole thing 's very ambiguous . Take her back to her cage . What ? ( YELLING ) Take her back in her cage ! All righty . All right , Ramona , now it 's time to go beddy-bye . Get into your cage . Oh , no you don 't . You 're not going to lock me in again . All right ... going to hang on to that tonight . Now what do you want ? Oh , you want I should sit down and rock you to sleep , huh ? Oh , OK . Come on , Ramona ... Up we go ... and over . ( SINGING ) Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top . When the wind blows ... cut Ramona , you got to go to bed ... The cradle will rock . ( SINGING ) Do I want you ? Oh my ... do I ... baby . Indeed I do . Do I need you ... ( SINGING ) Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top . When the wind blows the cradle will rock . [ MUMBLING IN HIS SLEEP ] [ HUMMING ] Boy what a night ... what a moon ... Could reach right up and touch it . Well , good night . Sammy in bed ? No ... still in the laboratory . In the laboratory ? What 's he doing in there ? Humph ... putting Ramona to bed . Babysitting the chimp ? This I got to see . Oh no ... now I 've seen everything . Good night , Cuckoo . Chief Rakos ' honored to have great Doctor visit his humble abode . And how goes the scientific work ? Good , I hope . Huh ? Oh yes ... fine , fine . Everything is progressing satisfactorily . That is good . Mhm , this is great . Try this . Hey ... I like that . Hey Duke ... get a load of that , will ya ' ? Does he sleep with that thing on ? You eat . Look ... I told you 40 times ... get out of here . I know how to feed myself . You gotta eat to grow fat . Wait ... will you get out of ... get out of here . I know how to eat my own food . Duke , will you make her stop already . Fight your way out of it , kid . She outweighs me . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Oh , I get it ... you 're going to go out that door . I 'm going to go out this door . And then we 're going to meet over there . Right ? Oh , that 's a very good idea . Oh , by the way , here 's the bowl ... You get two cents back for it . Excuse me . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Sammy ! Sammy ! [ LAUGHTER ] What are you laughing about ? I was just thinking ... I had the fall out of a plane to meet you . Baby , when we get back to the States , we 're going to have a big wedding ... With all the trimmings . But Darling , my father will probably wish me to be married here with a full tribal ceremony . OK , OK ... we 'll get married in a Carbond by a motormen if you want ... just so it 's you . This belonged to my great , great grandmother . In your country , it is the custom for the man to give his sweetheart an engagement ring . Here ... this is the custom . [ HUMMING ] Where 'd you learn that tune ? That used to be my favorite tune in college . No kidding ? That 's right . Well it 's one of the tunes in our act . Really ? ( SINGING ) Too soon ... it was only part of the game you played . You 're smile only added life to your masquerade . Too soon ... I 'll be more than willing to give my heart . Too soon ... for a kiss that offers a world apart . And just like a fortune teller , I take your hand . But only misfortune beckons at your command . You promise a future bright with the early dawn . But when I awake tomorrow , will you be gone ? Am I waiting in vain ? May I kiss you again ? Please don 't hurt me or ever dessert me . Am I too late too soon ? To your health , my good Doctor . To yours . Mighty Chief Rakos ... I thank you for your hospitality . But it grows late and I have much to do tomorrow . Good night . My pleasure you come . Goodnight .

All right ... lay her down . She will be big like gorilla , no ? No ... I think not . I think not . Master ... she is back to little monkey . What is wrong ? Nothing is wrong , Chula ... nothing . Now I can change a man into a gorilla . A man to a gorilla . Not me , Master ... Not Chula ... please . No Chula ... not you . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Good morning , Chula . Morning . Good morning .

Another step in my experiment , my dear . Ramona is now a gorilla . Ramona ? This is Ramona ? Yes . Boy ... I 'd hate to have to rock her to sleep now . Do you intend to advance her one more step ? To the human level ? No . I don 't blame you , Doc . That 's the stupidest looking gorilla I ever saw . Did Pepe have any good news for our friend , Duke ? I don 't know . We can 't find him . He must be lost in the jungle . DUKE AS GORILLA : [ GROWLING ] Some of my people are searching for him . Sammy , I think we better go back to the village . Not me . I 'm tired of chasing around .

[ SPEAKING NATIVE TRIBAL LANGUAGE ] [ SPEAKING NATIVE TRIBAL LANGUAGE ] [ SPEAKING NATIVE TRIBAL LANGUAGE ] When you human , you did all the thinking for the both of us . Fine jam to have to get out of . And with nothing but my poor little brain to help us . And don 't look at me , will ya ? We got to get that screwy Doctor to change you back again . What if he hasn 't got the combination ? Oy vey . Aw ... don 't cry , Dukie . Just think what a sensation we 'll be when we get back home . I can see it all now ...

We got to think now . Quiet ... quiet ... quiet ... ( YELLING ) quiet ! Now sit down ... we got to think this over . Can 't stay here forever .

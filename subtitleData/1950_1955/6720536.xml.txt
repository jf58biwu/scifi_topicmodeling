DOES IT MATTER ? NOW , THEN , IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS , YOU AND YOUR WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS WOULD HANDLE MR. DONOVAN 'S TAX SITUATION IN SUCH A WAY THAT- - DONOVAN 'S DEAD , DR. CORY , AND THAT SEEMS TO ME- - AS I WAS SAYING ... IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD ULTIMATELY CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 'S CASE TO BE THROWN OUT . NOW YOU MAY TALK . DONOVAN 'S DEATH RELEASED ME FROM ANY AGREEMENT I MAY HAVE HAD . YOU 'RE MISTAKEN . CERTAIN CHECKS ENDORSED BY YOU ENSURE THAT AGREEMENT . TRY TO UNDERSTAND MY POSITION , DR. CORY . I FELT DIRTY FOR MANY YEARS . HERE WAS MY CHANCE TO , WELL ... I WENT TO MY FRIEND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OFFERED TO COOPERATE IN EXCHANGE FOR PERSONAL IMMUNITY . SO YOU TURNED ON YOUR MOST POWERFUL BACKER . A VERY TOUCHING STORY .

MR. FULLER ? ANOTHER REMINDER , LIKE THE SUIT ? YOU PUT IT VERY NICELY , SIR . WELL ? THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CANNOT ALLOW ME TO REVERSE MY PRESENT STAND . THAT , OF COURSE , IS YOUR PROBLEM .

I SUGGEST , MR. ADVISOR , THAT YOU CARRY ON . IS OUR PROCEDURE PERFECTLY CLEAR ? PERFECTLY . I 'M GLAD WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER . GENTLEMEN . [ DOOR CLOSES ] OPERATOR , THIS IS AN EMERGENCY .

TOM AND I WANT TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT . THEY 'RE ENTITLED TO THE BACK TAXES THEY WANT . HOW DARE YOU CRITICIZE MY BEHAVIOR ? AREN 'T WE ENTITLED TO THE TRUTH ? IT 'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY , BUT DAD WAS AN AWFUL MAN- - BETTER OFF DEAD . HIS POSSESSIVENESS , UGLY SUSPICIONS , DROVE MOTHER NEARLY INSANE . HE HAD HER COMMITTED TO AN INSTITUTION BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE . IT TOOK HIS DEATH FOR US TO GET MOTHER OUT . SO , YOU HATED HIM , TOO ? I LOATHED HIM . MOST PEOPLE LOATHED HIM . GET THEM OUT OF HERE , FULLER . SEE THAT NEITHER OF THEM GETS ANOTHER DIME . IMPOSSIBLE , DOCTOR . NOT AT ALL . I HAVE A SIGNED DOCUMENT TO THAT EFFECT . IT 'LL BE ON YOUR DESK IN THE MORNING . NOW , YOU PARASITIC INGRATES , GET OUT ! HEY , DOC . I READ ABOUT YOUR ACCIDENT . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? ALL RIGHT . GONNA SUE THE COMPANY WITH THE TRUCK THAT HIT YOU ? I HADN 'T THOUGHT OF IT .

IT 'S OF GREAT IMPORTANCE- - THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PERMANENT ABODE , OR RATHER VAULT , WHICH WILL PERPETUALLY HOUSE MR. DONOVAN 'S ... REMAINS . I 'LL DO AS YOU SAY , DOCTOR , BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP OF YOU TO DONOVAN IS SO UNNATURAL , SO ILLOGICAL . DON 'T YOU THINK I 'M ENTITLED TO THE TRUTH ? THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS , MR. FULLER . IN THE DONOVAN SITUATION , IT ENTAILS GREAT MISFORTUNE TO ALL WHO KNOW . BELIEVE ME , YOUR IGNORANCE IS INSURANCE FOR PERSONAL SAFETY . MR. DONOVAN INTENDS TO DOMINATE THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SCENE , AND A FATAL ACCIDENT WILL OCCUR TO ALL WHO HAPPEN TO STAND IN HIS WAY . GOOD DAY , SIR . [ DOOR CLOSES ] Cory : A FATAL ACCIDENT WILL OCCUR TO ANYONE WHO STANDS IN HIS WAY . FRANK AND JANICE- - THEY STAND IN MY WAY . PAT MADE THAT RECORDING WHILE THE BRAIN WAS DESTROYING YOCUM . THAT PROVES THE BRAIN CAN ONLY DOMINATE ONE PERSON AT A TIME . BUT AT THE RATE IT 'S GROWING , DO YOU THINK THAT 'LL ALWAYS BE SO ? WHO KNOWS ? HONESTLY , JAN , WE SHOULDN 'T WAIT . ANY MINUTE NOW , THAT THING MAY GET THE POWER TO PARALYZE US ALL . YOU HAVE ANOTHER PLAN ? MM-HMM , BUT I DON 'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN HERE . LET 'S STEP OUTSIDE . WHY ALL THE WAY OUT HERE ? I DON 'T KNOW . I FEEL BETTER OUTSIDE . JAN , PAT MAY NEVER GET AWAY FROM THE BRAIN . IT 'S UP TO US NOW . BUT PAT WOULDN 'T HARM US . DONOVAN WOULD--THE MINUTE WE GET IN HIS WAY . BUT MURDER--I CAN 'T BELIEVE THAT PAT- - BUT YOCUM 'S DEATH WAS NO ACCIDENT . DONOVAN ENGINEERED IT . THEN THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN TO US . DONOVAN COULD KILL US THE SAME WAY HE KILLED YOCUM . THAT 'S RIGHT , AND IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS TO WAIT ANY LONGER . NOW , WHEN PAT GETS BACK HOME , IT 'S UP TO YOU TO KEEP HIM OUTSIDE HERE . HOLD HIM . MAKE HIM ANGRY- - SO ANGRY THE BRAIN WON 'T KNOW WHAT I 'M DOING . WELL , WHAT 'S THAT ? I 'LL BE IN THE LABORATORY . OH , IT 'S A NIGHTMARE . DO YOU THINK IT 'LL WORK ? IT HAS TO , JAN . THE BRAIN IS VERY POWERFUL , BUT WE KNOW IT CAN ONLY CONCENTRATE ON ONE THING AT A TIME . WE 'VE PROVED THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN . FRANK ... WHAT 'LL HAPPEN TO PAT ? I MEAN , IF WE KILL THE BRAIN ... THE BRAIN IS DONOVAN . [ THUNDER ] FRANK ... HAS DONOVAN BECOME SO MUCH A PART OF PAT ? I MEAN , COULD PAT DIE ? WHO KNOWS ? THIS WHOLE THING IS BEYOND EXPERIENCE . IT 'S A GAMBLE .

BESIDES , YOU 'LL WORK UP AN APPETITE . PLEASE , PAT . OH , BUT , JANICE , SURELY IT 'S GOING TO RAIN . AND BESIDES ... ALL RIGHT , MY DEAR . LET 'S TAKE A WALK . [ BEEPING ] SMELL THE RAIN COMING ? HOW FRESH THE AIR IS BEFORE A SHOWER . YOU KNOW , JANICE , YOU WERE ALWAYS A VERY DEVOTED WIFE . WERE ? BUT I STILL AM . AND YOU 'VE BEEN A WONDERFUL HUSBAND . THANK YOU , MY DEAR .

WE CAN STOP PRETENDING NOW . YOU 'RE NOT PATRICK CORY . YOU 'RE SOMETHING EVIL LIVING IN HIS BODY . BUT WHATEVER YOUR PLAN IS , YOU 'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT . THE EXPERIMENT 'S OVER . YOU 'RE RIGHT . IT IS OVER . FROM NOW ON , WARREN DONOVAN IS A LIVING FACT . THERE 'S NO FURTHER NEED FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WHO GAVE HIM LIFE . THE SERVICES OF SCHRATT , CORY , AND YOURSELF ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED . THEN YOU 'LL BE THE ONE TO GO , MR. DONOVAN- - JUST AS YOU SHOULD 'VE GONE WEEKS AGO . [ THUNDER ] NO ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

YOU COULDN 'T POSSIBLY COMPETE WITH A FULLY DEVELOPED AND POWERFUL BRAIN . THANKS TO DR. PATRICK CORY , DONOVAN 'S BRAIN WILL LIVE , THRIVE , AND CONTINUE TO GROW FAR BEYOND THE BODY OF DR. CORY . IT IS ALREADY ABLE TO EXIST IN ANYBODY , ANYWHERE AT WILL . KNOWING THIS , YOU NOW KNOW TOO MUCH ... SO LOOK AT MY BRAIN , MY DEAR- - YOUR LAST LOOK . I PROMISE YOU IT WILL NOT BE A PAINFUL ONE .

BROOKE , WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ... I MEAN ... HOW LONG DO YOU SUPPOSE HE 'LL BE GONE ? WELL , I 'M SORRY . IT 'S HARD TO SAY . IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THERE 'S AN INDICTMENT . WELL , THEY DO KNOW IT WAS PAT 'S PLAN TO END THIS THING BY HOOKING THE LIGHTNING ROD INTO THE POWER SUPPLY . THEY KNOW THAT , DON 'T THEY ? IT 'S ALL ON THE TAPE RECORDER , MRS. CORY . OF COURSE , A GREAT DEAL WILL HINGE ON THE DECISION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD AS TO THE ETHICS OF THE EXPERIMENT AND THE VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS . WELL , WE 'LL GET TURNED AROUND . MR. BROOKE HAS THE VALISE , DEAR . DID YOU FIND THE FILES ON LAST YEAR ? EVERYTHING- - ALL CHARTS AND NOTES . WE 'RE COVERED ON PRACTICALLY EVERY MINUTE SINCE WE FIRST STARTED RESEARCH ... THANKS TO YOU , DEAR . HURRY BACK . I 'LL TRY . BUT THEY CAN 'T BLAME YOU--THEY CAN 'T . JAN , I WENT INTO THIS WITH MY EYES OPEN , BUT IT GOT OUT OF HAND , AND I DID MANY FOOLISH THINGS- - THINGS THAT MADE OTHER PEOPLE SUFFER . I 'M ONLY GRATEFUL THE STORM STRUCK WHEN IT DID , AND THAT FRANK SURVIVED . WILL HE BE WELL ENOUGH TO HELP YOU TESTIFY ? I HOPE SO . MAYBE IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT , THEY CAN USE ANOTHER COUNTRY DOCTOR AROUND HERE . NO , DEAR . YOU 'RE A SCIENTIST AND ALWAYS WILL BE . I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH . LET 'S GO , PAL .

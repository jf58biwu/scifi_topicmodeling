 One morning , two hours after dawn , the first manned rocket in the history of the world takes off from the Tarooma range , Australia . The three observers see on their scanning screens a quickly receding Earth . The rocket is guided from the ground by remote control as they rise through the ozone layer , the stratosphere , the ionosphere , beyond the air . They are to reach a height of 1,500 miles above the Earth and there learn what is to be learnt . For an experiment is an operation designed to discover some unknown truth . It is also a risk . When it is 1,400 miles up , all contact with the rocket is suddenly lost . Right , standing by . Standing by . Clear radio line to Australia . They 'll be on in a few seconds . Loudspeaker ? - Yes , we 're all ready for it . - Right . Hello , hello , Tarooma . Ready to receive your message . Over . Hello , England . Hello , England . George Harris reporting from Tarooma . 0330 hours , West Australian time . 1800 hours , Greenwich time . Doppler monitoring has proceeded continuously since last report , but no trace has been recorded or received . Repeat , no trace . Message received . Thank you , Harris . Same this end . Keep on trying . Report in six hours , will you ? Over . Message received , and signing off . OK , Marsh . - 57 hours now . - Yes , sir . What can I say , Judith ? If they were in a plane and it was hopelessly overdue , we 'd know that they were dead . In that thing , we just don 't know . They may still be alive . Yes . What went wrong there ? A point on the orbit that shouldn 't have meant anything . At least , it meant nothing to us . - We made every foreseeable allowance . - It 's frightening , looking into this for long . Those tiny marks on the plastic , they seemed so precise and certain at first . They come closer and closer till you see they 're only rough scratches . Could it have been like that with our calculations ? I should never have subjected you to this . When you married Victor , I ought to have taken you off the project . - I wouldn 't have gone . - I know . That 's what I was selfish enough to tell myself . You 're too valuable to me here . Listen , my dear . You 've been forcing yourself to face the worst facts . Face the hopeful ones . Such as ? Your husband and the others are not merely brave . They have expert knowledge . They 're resourceful . Now , you 're going to get some sleep . And under strict orders . Control room . One moment . It 's for you , sir . The Ministry . - Not Blaker ? - I 'm afraid so , sir . Come on . Hello , Blaker . I told you I 'd send word if there was any change . I wish to heaven I ... Report ? I thought there was no question of that yet . I don 't want to visit this on you , but I 've got to keep the committee posted . Believe me , Quatermass , I 'm trying to help you . The nastier the facts , the more it matters how they 're presented . The future development ... Development be damned . Tell them the facts . All trace of the rocket was lost over 57 hours ago , when it deviated from its estimated path at 25,000 miles per hour . I 've done so , less bluntly . You 're keeping in touch with the Australian base , of course ? Yes . They haven 't got anything to report . I 've had enough of this cross-examination . Your committee seem concerned , but it 's an investment I was never able to guarantee . Accept that our sole concern is for the crew . Frankly , is there any chance of their survival ? Well , equally frankly , I don 't ... How can anybody answer a question like that ? What do you imagine MY concern is ? Radio line , quick ! Control room . Yes , put him on . Hello , Tarooma . Ready to receive you . Come in , Tarooma . We 're getting a trace . Faint , and the direction doesn 't make any sense , but it 's there . A trace ! Oh , thank God . The rocket 's heading back to Earth . Confirm you 're receiving me . Receiving you loud and clear . Professor Quatermass is taking over . Quatermass here . Is the rocket responding to your remote control ? Over . No response to our radio signals as yet . Estimated distance from Earth , 29,000 miles . Sorry , correct that to 28,600 miles . - They 're having difficulty in tracking . - The direction ? Can you give code fixes ? Over . We 're going to do our best . Hold on . Stand by . 29 , 34 . Repeat , 29 , 34 . 106 , 259 . 106 , 259 . Zero , 7 . Zero , 7 . Over . Message received . Stand by to compare findings . 29 , 34 . 106 , 259 . - Zero , 7 . - Approaching at a very steep angle . - Straight down ? - Not yet . If that curve is confirmed , they have a chance . 106 , 259 ? That may bring them right round the Earth instead of smack into it . It 's all right . I 'm not letting myself go . - That curve must be the end of an ellipse . - Yes . It doesn 't tell us where they 've been , but it can tell us how far they 've been . What 's the result ? Something like 380,000 miles into space . 380,000 ? But that 's more than we 'd ever planned for . Half as far again as the Moon . You know , I think about them out there . Even now , I 'm jealous . To be the first , the very first . - Altitude ? - Oh , yes , altitude . Altitude , 3,200 miles . If it 's going to respond to our remote control , it should be soon . Control room . - Blaker 's arrived . He 's demanding to see you . - Oh , damn his demands at a time like this . I ... All right , let him come through . - Carry on . - Yes , of course . - Keep checking that contact by manual . - Yes , sir . - Only got a minute . - You realise ... A trace . The Australians got it first . It 's coming through . - The rocket ? - We believe so , yes . I hope you 're right . What 's being done ? - We 're waiting for radio response . - From the crew ? - From their apparatus . That 's more important . - More important ? Their speech transmitter 's dead . To save them we must attempt separation by remote control . Separation ? I thought you hadn 't understood . Just take a look at this model . Now ... The rocket 's made up of two sections weighing about 1,000-odd tons altogether . In front is the crew section where those three men are . Behind is the atomic propulsor unit . Now , our purpose was modest enough . Gain a height of 1,500 miles , make certain observations there . That would take about 47 minutes . Then , after a single circuit of the Earth , the crew-containing section was to be separated and brought back , leaving the atomic propulsor behind , 940 tons of it , and all dangerously radioactive . - We wouldn 't bring that back even if we could . - You mean it would just stay there ? Forever , or until called for , circling the Earth , 1,500 miles up . - Sounds simple enough . Too simple to accept ... - Well , it wasn 't simple . Something went wrong . We don 't know what . Probably something as simple as valve failure . - But surely ... - Oh , we had spares , and spares for spares . But instead of turning into the prearranged orbit like that , the rocket kept gaining speed , shot out into space like that . And you believe that what you 're tracking now is it ? Well , if the path it took happened to be a true ellipse , not just a parabola , then dynamic laws bring it near the Earth again . But unless we separate the two sections , they 'll just sweep past , and this time it 'll be for good . - Well , of course ... - 18 , 21 . 112 , 407 . - Zero , minus 4 . - Zero , minus 4 . That 's it ! - It 's responding ! - Yes , there 's no doubt . Control Base to BR7 . - Control Base to BR7 . Are you receiving me ? - Hello ? Greene ? Reichenheim ? Carroon ? - Victor ? - Are you able to receive me ? Over . That may be nothing . Try to get control . - Strong response . - Position ? - Dopplers working . - Judith , stand by . - Yes , I will . - I 'm going to try and regain control . - No , 419 . - Yes , 419 . - That 's it ! - Full response . - You 've got it ! - All right for a start . - The separation ? - As soon as we get the deviation down to nil . - Travelling at 25,000 miles an hour . - 25,000 ! - Can we do it ? - Deviation 0.007 . Tarooma , we 've made contact with the rocket . It 's obeying remote control . Professor Quatermass is about to attempt separation of sections one and two . Stand by . Deviation 0.002 . 0.001 . Nil . - Yes ! - Wait . - That 's it , that 's it ! - He 's done it . Stand by . Keep your eyes on it . Now for reversal . Check gimbal system . Eight-nine . Three-zero . Zero . - Right , full response . - Zero to 30 . - 40 . - Reversal procedure . Full response . Blaker , this is how we check velocity . Turn it about and fire propulsion units against the direction of the flight . - Turn completed . - Speed has been reduced . Descent has begun . Over . - Are you directing it down to us ? - No . No , we can 't risk losing control . - It 's up to you . Good luck . Over . - Thanks . Please stay in contact . Over . Well ? You say it . - For the very first time , they 've a chance . - Yes . Past the Channel coast now . - Velocity ? - 840 per hour . Check . - 845 . - Far too fast for that altitude . Para-brake is not enough . Use the other . - Wait . Not too soon . - It 's still ahead of the speed of sound . - Connect me to all stations . - Forewing drag . - Still not enough . Marsh ? - 810 . - We 've got to use ... - Calling all stations . The rocket is under control . We intend to bring it down here . There may be some danger . Go at once to emergency points . Fire and crash brigades , stand by . Applying fabric para-brakes . One . Two . Three . - Great Scott ! Three 's failed ! - 720 . 690 . - It 's impossible . - They must be able to do something ! - Calling BR7 ! Are you receiving me ? - That 's useless . Motors on in seven seconds . - 490 . - It 's going to fall short . - Two seconds , two seconds . - 230 . 210 . They 're nearly down . They 've crashed . - Yes , but where ? Quickly ! - Just getting it , sir . - Well ? - Only ten miles away . Just southwest of London . Croydon . No , nearer than that . We must know . We must know . We haven 't got a minute to lose . Come on . What is it ? What is it ? - Don 't touch it ! - I ain 't going to . It 's a bomb . There was an awful noise . It 's red-hot . All that smoke ! Oh , it 's going to go off . - Come here , Len . Come here ! - Shut up . It looks like steam . All that just now , roaring flames . God , Len , it 's something dreadful . Come away , Len . You 're out of your mind . Ring the fire brigade ! And the police . Oh , Len , we 'll be done for . The old girl . Over there , in the house . She 'll be inside . - You 're not going . She 's dead . She must be . - Leave me be . - What about this ? - Never seen ... - Here , keep clear . It 's red-hot . - It 's one of them things . They dropped one . - It 's going to go off ! - There 's an old girl in the house . Why didn 't you ? Keep away , everybody ! This thing may be dangerous . You in those next houses , grab some clothes and get away . What is it ? What is it ? Len ! Len , you fool , she 's dead . She must be . Len ! Oh , you 've left me . Oh , it 's going to go off ! It 's going to go off ! - Look , I 'll go round the front way and bust in . - Wait a sec . There 's somebody up there . - Can you get a ladder ? - I know where there 's one . - Ma 'am , are you all right ? - Yes . I was trying to catch Henry and put him in his basket . Right , we 'll have you down in a moment . Put it up here . That 's the idea . - Hope this 'll bear me . - Yeah , be all right . - Would you take Henry first , please ? - Right . Thank you . There you are , my dear . Gently does it . That 's the idea . Take it easy . Plenty of time . Nearly there . Thank you so much . - All right ? Not hurt ? - She wouldn 't know . Shock . What is it , Officer ? Have they started again ? - Is there anybody else in there ? - Oh , no . Who could there be ? - All right . - I was just going to bed . Then the noise came , and that bright light , and poor Henry , he scampered under the dressing table . - Oh , dear , oh , dear . Whatever is it ? - Get her to somewhere safe . I 'll report this . - Has that gone off yet ? - No , not yet . Now , come on . Step . Lift your feet up , now . That 's the idea . Oh , look . Look , my mother 's clock . - Are you sure that thing hasn 't gone off ? - No . But there must be a report in by now . You know who I am . It 's not under Official Secrets . - Get it out of them . - No , it was not a guided missile . But it crashed somewhere in South London . Listen , you collect all the reports from squad cars and men on the beat ? What ? Oh , all right , I 'll hang on . He says there 's a report just coming in . Hello ? - Where ? West side of Wimbledon Common ? - Let me . Here 's Quatermass himself . Hold on . Hello . How bad is it ? Still whole ? Much damage ? Any casualties ? Thank God . I 'm on my way over . Don 't let anybody touch it . Keep the fire people off it . Hosing a red-hot rocket will blow it up . There are three people inside . Right . Come on . - What is he saying ? - It 's in one piece and not too badly buried . - Anything about them ? - No . - Car 's outside , sir . - Come on . What ? How many were killed ? Injured ? None ? Hello , hello ? Yes , this is still the news desk . Have you seen the thing yourself ? What did it look like ? Ah . Uh-huh . Time ? What time did all this happen ? - Eh ? You must know when . - All right , Jacko ? Oh , all right , then . How junior can a junior local correspondent be ? Gone to ask a man when it happened . What is it ? The man with staring eyes , or robbed while they watched television ? - Something came down . - Came down ? - Crashed . - Ah , mystery plane . Good night , Jacko . Sounded more like a flying saucer scare . Lots of stuff about a light in the sky , and smoke . Hello ? Only ten minutes ago ? All right , I 'll send somebody . Get what you can and phone it in . And wake up ! - Flying saucer ? Who are you going to send ? - Jackson . Hello ? - I 'll do it . - Hello , is Arthur Jackson there ? You ? But , Jimmy , this is just a straight write-out job . Not Fullalove stuff at all . I need something to denounce , Jacko . After dieticians and graphologists and the flower show , something that 's somebody 's fault . - Lay on a snap-shotter , will you ? - All right . But it 's got to be in right away . Oh , dear . Back on the beat . If it 's not a bomb , why treat it like a bomb ? - I 've told you the instructions . - Leave it dead alone . But there 's still smouldering wood in there that we can 't put out . - It 's not my fault . Keep back , there ! - There 'll be a report in about this . Is it true the bomb disposal people are on their way ? I told you before , keep back . Leonard , I suppose . Everyone calls me Len , though . Matthews . - Did it make a noise coming down ? - Terrifying , that 's the word . Terrifying . There was this great blare of light , and then the whole neighbourhood sort of shuddered . Smoke everywhere . Never met anything like it . - Get back . - I 've got to get a story . This is final . Nobody beyond that rope there . Look , we 've got a public duty , too . Back behind there , please ! Tell those people they can 't come through . Sergeant , stop them ! One minute , Inspector . This is Professor Quatermass . He 'll be in charge now . - Very well . - Now , then ... - The heat ! - They 've got a heavy casing . - Funny . It looks exactly the same . - Yes , just a bit darker in colour . Yet it 's been ... You can 't just say " far " . There isn 't a word . - The transmitter 's probably gone , but I 'll try . - Yes , go ahead . Hello . Hello . This is Marsh speaking . Are you receiving me ? Over . - No , gentlemen . No statement . - If it 's a weapon , tell us . We use discretion . - I don 't doubt it , but ... - Look , they 're using a walkie-talkie . - There must be somebody inside . - Stand by for a picture . - How long do we have to wait ? - A few hours . - I can 't . - You think it 's intact ? - As far as I could see . - Professor Quatermass ! - British Experimental Rocket Group , isn 't it ? - Yes . - So that 's it . Fred ! - Some other time . - It 's all right . - What is that thing ? - It 's a rocket . - Where was take-off ? - Western Australia . - Australia ! - It 's travelled halfway round the world . - Further than that . - You 've been conducting an experiment ? - How many aboard ? - Three men . - Are they safe ? - Their names ? - You got no reply just now . - Greene , Reichenheim and Carroon . - What now ? What are you waiting for ? What was the object of this experiment ? Stop the noise ! Listen . Do you hear it ? The tapping . They 're alive . This the BBC Light Programme . Before the late news summary , here is a special item . Just over one hour ago , a British-made rocket vehicle , the first ever to have succeeded in reaching outer space , made a safe crash-landing in the area of Wimbledon Common . A product of the British Experimental Rocket Group , it carries a crew of three men . They will be unable to leave the rocket until it has cooled , but there is reason to suppose they are in good health . In view of the importance of this achievement and because the appearance of the rocket has given rise to rumours , we shall be relaying a short description of the scene at the end of this bulletin . Pass along , please . Miss Wilde , you don 't remember much about it ? No , except that everything fell down and then I saw my room was quite , quite broken . It 's tragic that your house should have suffered , but I think we can salute in this story of brave men a brave little lady . - Henry was brave , too . - Henry ? - Yes , my Henry . - Oh , yes . Miss Wilde has her cat with her . - He doesn 't appear to be at all frightened . - No , no , not my Henry . No . The scene here now is one of jubilation . There 's a tremendous crowd , coming in by car , on foot , from every direction . People are singing and cheering . I can even see some barrow boys over there cashing in . Yes , and here to pick up the story is Mr Leonard Matthews , who lives nearby , and was first on the scene , weren 't you ? - Yes . I seen this great blare of light ... - Len was out of the house in a flash . - Mrs Matthews . - No hesitation . Just as he was in the Blitz . - I think he ought to have a medal . - Oh , I dunno . Mr Matthews , what did you see , exactly ? There was all this here smoke , and I got busy putting out the fire . Can 't we signal again to let them know where they are , that we 're here ? Hammering on the hull might be dangerous . - Professor Quatermass ? BBC interviewer . - I can 't be bothered . - You ought to . - Oh , all right . This way , please . # We 're making history , we 're making history # We 're making history ... # It 's very difficult for me to say . I 'm not in a senior position . My dear fellow , you know what 's the matter with you , don 't you ? You 're too modest . You 're ... You 're too modest . Go on , tell them . Tell them that you invented it . - But I didn 't . - Take a jump ! Yes , you did . You 're too modest . He did it , really . But you 're too modest altogether . You ought to be not so modest as you are . Professor , it 's true to say , isn 't it , that this atomic rocket , the very first of its kind , is a tremendous technical advance ? - I dare say we have surprised people . - I should say so . Designed and built by British brains and muscle . Professor , can you tell us about the crew ? - Well , we shan 't know that for a few hours . - No , I meant personal details . - Who are they ? - Oh , I 'm sorry . The senior member is my friend Charles Greene . He 's responsible for navigation , although we employ automatic piloting and remote control . - I see . Is Mr Greene married ? - Yes . His wife arrives tomorrow from Australia . - I see . Who else ? - Then there 's Dr Ludwig Reichenheim . You remember his experiments with rockets in Germany ? - Yes , indeed , I do . - The youngest is Victor Carroon . He 's responsible for ... Engineer and radio operator . Sort of general gadgets . Is he married ? - Yes . His wife is my first assistant . - Oh , really ? - Yes . She 's over there . - Must be an anxious time for her , for you all . We hope soon to have good news of these three valiant Britons , or British subjects . Thank you , Professor . Yes , here is the wife of one of them . Mrs ? - Carroon . - Mrs Carroon . - All listeners sympathise with your anxiety . - Thank you . How does it feel to be married to one of the first three men to reach outer space ? - I 'll know that when I see him . - Yes . You weren 't able to go to Australia ? - No . My work here . - Of course . If you don 't mind my asking , what was your farewell message ? Oh , it was silly . Just the sort of thing people always say at a serious time like that . I think I said , " Take care of yourself , darling , and don 't forget to bring me something back . " - A present from outer space , so to speak . - Yes . Thank you very much indeed , Mrs Carroon . Now , as nothing more is going to happen here for some hours , I 'm returning you to the studio . Well , thank you very much , everybody . Thank you very much . OK , pack up . - The trouble with you is you 're too modest . - Sir , no . - Give me that . You 're too modest ! - Officer . How dare you put your hands on me like that ? How dare you ? You 're a lot of ruddy modest English violets , the whole lot of you . All right , keep it quiet . It 's fascinating . That elemental excitement children feel with a parcel that 's waiting to be opened . The longer you wait , the more exciting it gets . Is that why you don 't pull the string ? That 'll sound better in your column tomorrow . I expect so , if I 'm not frozen stiff before then . - Touching . They 've sent an ambulance for me . - Check the temperature again . - Yes , sir . - Quite cool . About 100 degrees . - Ambulance standing by . - Thank you . - How do you mean to do it ? By remote control , as soon as I get contact . Otherwise you 'll have to tear the parcel open . Is that it ? Just look at that crowd watching in dead silence . - Boys who look anxiously over your shoulder . - Sir , sir ! See them watching now , standing on tiptoe , pressing forward , not a word spoken . That 's it ! That 's it ! It is Victor ! Victor ! He 's alive . Thank God . Take that . Marsh . - Breathing normally . - You 're safe . He 'll be all right . Quick , the access chamber . Mr Greene . Dr Reichenheim . I don 't understand . How could they ? - Nobody there . No sign of either of them . - What 's that ? They 're gone . They 're gone ! - What 's going on ? - Picture , Fred ! As a matter of interest , this happens to be news . - What is it ? - They 're not inside . - Opened the door and got swept away ? - This door hasn 't been opened till now . Victor , where are the others ? Victor ? Victor ! What happened ?

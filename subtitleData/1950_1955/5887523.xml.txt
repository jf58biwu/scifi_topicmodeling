 Now that calm and sanity have returned to the textile industry , I feel it my duty to reveal something of the true story behind the recent crisis - A story which we were happily able to keep out of the newspapers at the time . The trouble began - Not in my own mill , I 'm glad to say - But during my visit to the mill owned by Michael Corland , Which manufactures an artificial fiber , similar to my own . Corland is a personable young man , Who seemed to have impressed my daughter . He was also anxious to impress me , With the idea that his mill was a sound financial investment . Output is excellent . Six million yards of filament a day . - How many ? - Six million . That 's right , isn 't it , Hill ? - Six million feet . - Yes , Mr. Corland . - Feet , of course . - Of course . Good morning . I 'm lunching here with Mr. Corland and my father . They 're still looking around the mill , Miss Birnley . Would you care to wait in Mr. Corland 's off - Um , Michael . Hello , daddy . Good morning , Mr. Hill . Now , now , Daphne , please don 't interrupt . I 'm having a most illuminating tour . This way ? - This way , Mr. Birnley . - Oh , this way . Thank you . - How 's it going ? - Sticky . - Why , what does he say ? - Oh , nothing . That 's the trouble . Oh , that 's only his " kingpin of industry " act . " Forty glorious years in textiles " . Don 't let it get you down . I 'm sure he 'll put up all the money you want . - Sorry ... Sir . - Come on . Come on . Of course , it 's hardly up to what you have at Birnleys . Quite . Eh , for instance , Sir , if you 'd step this way . Mr. Green , perhaps you would show Mr. Birnley ... The latest thing you 've been working on . Just a moment , Green . Thank you . What 's this ? I really couldn 't say , Mr. Birnley . Mr. Green , Perhaps you would explain . Gladly . Well , it 's , uh - Obviously , it 's , uh - Mr. Wilkins ? Yes , Sir . - Is , uh , this yours ? - No , Sir . Harrison ? - Yours ? - No , Sir . I thought it was ... his . Well , does it matter , really ? Merely a matter of interest . Fotheringay ? Could you spare us a moment ? What is this ? Don 't you know ? I think it was a special job . Who for ? Come along . Come along . Who authorized it ? Apparently you did . Really , Mr. Green , you must know whether you did or did not . What does it matter , anyway ? I think you 're being very ru - There must be some quite ordinary explanation . It 's ridiculous . The thing can 't have grown there . Mr. Hill , will you please find out what this is about ? Yes , Sir . Green , check with the accounts department . Of course . Take them the order number . Uh , very good , Sir . Right away , sir " .3-7-8-2-5 . 3-7-8-2-5 . " " 3-7-8-2-5 . 3-7-8-2-5 . " I 'm so sorry . I really shouldn 't start asking questions . - On the contrary . Shall we lunch ? - Yes . - I think you 've seen just about everything . - Yes , I think I have . " 3-7-8-2-5 . " Here it is . £ 4,000 ? But spent on what ? Hydrogen , Sir . Heavy hydrogen . This is absolute nonsense ! Oh , for heaven 's sake ! I want to aim at materials and designs , Combining the strength and simplicity ... Of the old english hand loom weavers , with the color and fire ... Of the flemish or provençal . - Now , if I had an extra hundred thousand - Ahem . - Excuse me , Sir . - After lunch , Hill . - It 's very urgent . - After lunch , Hill ! Where was I ? Well , you mustn 't let us keep you from anything vital . No , it 's nothing . Nothing . What is it , Michael ? It 's nothing . Excuse me , will you , please ? So I told him . - Mr. Wilkins ! - Yes ? Mr. Corland wants you . He 's in accounts . Mr. Harrison ! They want you , too , in accounts . Excuse me . Could you tell me where Mr. Corland is please ? Stratton ! Mr. Corland wants you ! No , Mr. Corland , you 're not firing me . I resign . I 'm not a cheat , nor a swindler . I did what I did because there was no other way . I may have had just a menial job here , but at cambridge , They gave me a first and a fellowship . I would be there still if they hadn 't been so shortsighted . Just as you are and all the others I 've worked for . But one day , there 'll be someone with real vision . I shall have a laboratory given to me . A proper laboratory , with really modern equipment . And assistants of my own . No , don 't interrupt me . It 's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress . But this is too big a thing , bigger than you - I see you 've been discharged from your last six positions . - Seven . - Oh . Oh , well , perhaps a change in environment might - Oh , no , it must be a textile mill . - I see there 's a vacancy at the Birnley mill , but - Birnleys ? - Yes , but ... - They have a research lab , haven 't they ? I 'm afraid this hardly suits your qualifications . - They want a works laborer . - Oh , that 'll suit me . - That 's a nice place to leave it , isn 't it ? - Sorry . - Sorry . - Don 't mention it . - You 've got it loaded too heavy . - Have i ? You want to leave it so you can see over the top . Oh . Yes , of course . Thanks . - New , aren 't you ? - Uh , yes . - Never worked in a mill before ? - Oh , yes , several . I know . Leave school , Into the first blind alley job that comes along . Too old for that . Into another and another . By the time you 're 30 , what are you ? Flotsam floating on the flood tide of profits . There 's capitalism for you . It wasn 't quite like that . I got a scholarship to Cambridge . But you hadn 't got the old school tie . Oh , you can 't tell me . Discrimination . I 've seen plenty . Where were you going with this lot ? The loading bay , I think they call it . You were going the wrong way anyhow . It 's down there . Tea up . Better leave it . Oh , tea ? No thanks . I think I 'd rather - Tea break ! We had to fight for it . Just a moment . Look , uh , we 'd better help you with it . It 's very delicate . Yes , Sir . Pete , give us a hand with this . And get these gentlemen some overalls . Well , where 's sid ? Sid ! Sid ! No , no , quite wrong . Sid ! Where 's it got to go ? Up to the lab . It 's an electro - And electrola - An electron microscope . Ah , at last ! We 'd better go and check this over . Mm , it 's a beautiful job . No , no ! You must have the gun filament off before you switch on the projector , Otherwise you 're liable to put 4,000 volts through the cathode ... And blow it to bits . Quite . That 's the specimen stage I suppose . The intermediate alignment section . This is the specimen stage . Of course . It seems to be all right . If the chief 's satisfied , we 'll go . I don 't suppose you could spare someone for a while , Just till we get the hang of it ? What , me ? Well , not necessarily you yourself . One of your assistants , perhaps . Well , I see . Well , I-I think perhaps I might manage it . In fact , it might be quite convenient . You sure you 're not too , uh , busy ? There are a few things , of course , but ... If while I 'm here , you could let me have a corner of a bench . Oh , certainly , certainly . Uh , see to that , will you , Wilson ? I couldn 't say , I 'm sure . All right , love . Tell her she can pay it friday . He didn 't say nothing this morning . Sid , what 's all this ? Harry says you 've quit . - Oh , yes , yes . - Why ? - Well , you see , I - - You didn 't get sacked ? - Oh , no , no , no . - Then , what happened ? Well , I 've got the chance of another job . - Where ? - At Birnleys , too , in a way . - You haven 't quit , then ? - Yes and no . I got the chance of working in the laboratory . It 's a better job . - Oh , yes , much . - And more money ? Well , I shan 't actually get paid for it . What ? We 'll see about that . Scab labor . Huh . - The works committee had better hear about this . - But I don 't want to get paid . - Not want to ? - I don 't care whether you want to get paid or not . - You 've got to get paid . - Bertha , you mustn 't do that . It 'll ruin everything . It 's only for a few weeks . I promise you . What are you going to do for money ? I was going to speak to you about that , Mrs. Watson . I know it 's a lot to ask , but ... if I could owe you the rent for a couple weeks - Only the rent - I shan 't need any food . - You 'll not need food ? - Oh , I 'll get that somewhere . Of course you can stay , Mr. Stratton . Thanks very much , indeed . Sid , are you in trouble ? No . Everything 's fine . I 've ... got some money in the post office . Not very much , but you could have it if you need it . I can get most of what I need at the lab . But if there are a few oddments , I 'll let you know . Thanks . Anytime . I 'm even glad , Michael . You get no money from father . All right . I 'm freer to say we 'll get married as soon as you like . You 're - You 're very sweet , but I 'm not going to let you . What do you mean , Michael ? I wouldn 't dream of letting you marry me in a fit of temper . Not until you can do it in perfectly cold blood . Well , I must be off . I have to look around in some other direction . Daddy . I thought you 'd gone , Daphne . Father , I know what you think about Michael . You think all he wants is my money . Hmm . Mine . Well , it just so happens you 're wrong . He 's going to find some other way to do all the things he wants . Splendid ! And he still wants me ! Well , if you want him , Daphne , Then I 'm very glad . So , now will you change your mind about him ? Well , if that means - Will I invest in him in spite of what I 've seen of his mills - No . Just because there was a lunatic in the place , you blame him . It might have happened to anyone . - In the Birnley mills , for instance ? - I 'm sick of the Birnley mills ... And everything connected with them . And the sooner I leave home , the happier I shall be . Sorry . Hey ! Wait ! Well , all right . Ah , Mr. Stratton . I don 't quite see your point about this . Daddy , just a minute . I - Miss Birnley ! Please don 't tell your father . You 're working for him now . How nice . Does he know ? I can 't wait to tell him . - Miss Birnley ! Look , Miss Birnley ! - Get off ! Just give me two more days . One even . It 's more important than anything . It 's going to astound the world ! Look . You know about the problem of polymerizing amino acid residues ? What did you say ? Look . You know what a long-Chain molecule is ? - A what ? - Do you know what a molecule is ? No . Something like an atom ? That 's it ! Atoms stuck together . In this case , like a long chain . Now , cotton and silk and every natural fiber is made up of these chains . And recently we 've learned to make artificial fibers with even longer chains , Such as , um , rayon and nylon . You 've heard of nylon ? Well , I think I 've succeeded in the copolymerization ... Of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules . Both containing ionic groups . It 's really perfectly simple . I believe I 've got the right catalyst to promote interaction ... Between the reactive groups at the end of the peptide chains ... And the carbohydrate combination , While the charges of the ionic groups will cross-Link the chains ... And confer valuable elastic properties . At high temperature and pressure - " ... And give a molten liquid so that there is a great probability of ... " Polymerization ... " To give a natural molecule of a length great enough ... To confer spinnability " . Just wanted something to read in bed . Good night , daddy . Well , after all , how the devil can I do anything about it ? What 's this ? Hey ! Here , I need that ! Terribly sorry . It 's very important . Just a minute . I 'm using that . - What 's all this ? - Where 's Mr. Birnley ? I 've got to see Mr. Birnley . Mr. Stratton , what 's the matter ? - Mr. Hoskins , it 's worked . I 've done it ! - Done what ? The radioactive groups in the fiber-forming molecules ... Haven 't catalyzed the internal rearrangement . Not in the least . I thought the polymerization would be sterically hindered . But it wasn 't . It wasn 't . Where are my notes ? - Mr. Stratton ! - I 'll see you later . I 've got to see Mr. Birnley . - You can 't do that . - I 've done it ! I 've done it ! Stop him ! Stop him ! Don 't let him go ! Don 't let him go ! - Nurse Gamage . - I 've got to see Mr. Birnley . You 're fired . You understand ? Fired ! You can 't fire me . I don 't work here . What ? That 's right . He doesn 't . Now then ? Ah , sister ! Come here . What 's the trouble ? He 's mad , that 's the trouble . A strong sedative , that 's what he needs . Fantastic . Utterly fantastic . A lunatic , obviously . Yes , Sir . Very odd , indeed . I want to see Mr. Birnley . I can 't get any sense out of the rest of them . It 's terribly important . Your name . My name , it 's ... Stratton . Sidney Stratton . I work at the mill . That is , I did work at the mill . Only I - - You have an appointment ? - No , but you see , I know that - It would have been better had you made an appointment . Mr. Birnley 's busy now . A meeting . But I couldn 't make an appointment . Sorry . Write a letter or telephone . There 's no question of it . But , Mr. Birnley - It 's all very well between these four walls , but what are the shareholders going to say ? £ 8,300 for sundries ? - What sundries ? - Davidson will be here at any moment . Now , he should be able to answer that . Oh , Mr. Birnley 's expecting you . No , please , listen . Let me explain ! Please ! Please ! What 's all this ? Oh , it 's nothing . Please give this to Mr. Birnley . I promise you he 'll want to see me . I expect my works manager to know everything , Davidson , down to the smallest detail . I should hardly call £ 8,000 a detail . Judging by the job numbers , Mr. Birnley , Hoskins must know . Well , who 's Hoskins ? Your head of research , Sir . Well , can you find his private number , or is it too much to hope ? Oh , do try . How can it be impossible ? I 've got them here . But - Let me speak to him . - Oh , it 's you . - Hello . Have you done it ? - Yes , I have , but I - - Come right in . Look . Listen , I 'm asking you a simple question . What is it , Knudsen ? No , I don 't care what his name is . I want to know what he - Very well , then . You must find him and send him up here . No , certainly not . Tell him to go away . What do you mean , you can 't ? Well , you must know his address . Why , hang it all , he 's an employee . Now , look here . He said to go away . - She 's gone to fetch him . Really , she has . - Daphne , have you gone mad ? I 'm in the middle of a difficult meeting . I don 't know what you 're talking about . How can you if you won 't listen ? Whatever it is can wait for half an hour . This friend of yours can 't be so important - No , don 't , don 't , don 't ! Please , don 't ! Ah , there you are at last ! Now listen to me . I will not listen to you . Get out ! I won 't . Daddy ! Knudsen ! You 're an irresponsible young idiot . Knudsen ! Father ! And you 're a pompous and ungrateful old ass . Oh ! - Sidney ! - Knudsen ! Knudsen ! Knudsen ! No , father , listen to me . Knudsen ! If you think I 'd give it to you , you must be crazy , not if you were the last man on earth . Even if I liked you , I wouldn 't give it to you if you went down ... On your knees and begged for it . Knudsen . I won 't stay in your house another minute . Oh ! You 've made an idiot of yourself , father . And I 'm delighted to say you 're going to regret it . You need a good spanking . You don 't even know what he 's done . Well , apart from costing me £ 8,000 , what has he done ? He 's made a new kind of cloth . It never gets dirty , and it lasts forever . Well , that 's ridiculous . Oh , it is , is it ? Do you know what a long-chain molecule is ? Do you know what happens if one makes one of infinite length ... With optimum interchain attractions ? Do you know what it means ? It means that to break the fiber , you 'd have to split the molecule . It means , for all practical purposes , it would last forever . And it has a surface charge of static electricity . It repels dirt . That may be nonsense , of course . Maybe he hasn 't really done it . Maybe he 's talking through his hat . On the other hand , maybe he has . Maybe you 're talking through yours . The point is you don 't know , And you 're too pigheaded to find out . £ 8,300 . They 're bound to ask questions . Stratton , you 're coming straight away with me to see mister - Ah , Hoskins . I 've decided to authorize Mr. Stratton ... To continue his research here . I 'm sure I can rely on you to give him everything he needs . - Yes , Sir . - Well , there you are , Sidney . Well , you 've got your contract . And you 'll get your equipment . Now , is there anything else ? - There is just one thing . - Yes , my boy . I 've been thinking about the possibility of ... chain reactions . And I think probably we ought to ... clear the lab . Clear the lab ? Only as a precaution . Secrecy , you mean ? Th-That too . You 're a shrewd boy . See about that , Hoskins . And you 'll see that not a word gets out about this , even in the mills . Well , perhaps we shall have a little surprise to spring on our competitors . Yes . Well , there we are . Shall we try it now , Or do you think we ought to wait until after lunch ? Whatever you say . Let 's have a go now . Oh , sorry . Mr. Hoskins ? Next door . Thanks . Oh , Mr. Hoskins . Good morning . I didn 't know where to find you at first . Would you just okay these for accounts , please ? It does seem an extraordinary amount . I suppose it 's necessary . My dear king - It shouldn 't have done that . Accounts have sent us a rough estimate , Sir . £ 18,749 . Mm-Hmm . Might be worse . Plus , two thousand to cover the damage to the building . What ? Oh , I see . Anything else ? Yes , Sir . Radioactive thorium ! Well , what does he want that for ? What ? Shut the door . There 's another one due at any moment . What is it all for , exactly ? It 's a lot of tomfoolery if you ask me . Hello , yes , Hoskins here . Manchester daily express here . We heard there were some accidents in the laboratory . Explosion . I just wondered if there was a story in it . Must be some stupid rumor . Of course , we are making some structural alterations . But that 's all . Yes , right . Good-Bye . There 's the - Uh-Oh . There go the fireworks again . Good as blackpool , eh , Frank ? Someone will get hurt if it goes on . If anyone does , it 'll be sid . He 's the one who 's taking all the chances . And if you was any kind of a shop steward , You 'd be getting him danger money . Fat lot he needs it . Jumped out of his overalls into a cushy job pretty fast ... And a cushy pay packet too . Well , whatever he gets , he earns all right . It 's Birnley 's pockets he 's lining , or they wouldn 't have pushed him into it . And a fat lot they care if he goes through the roof . Me too . Well ... here 's hoping . I must frankly admit that I 'm discouraged . Very discouraged . No one 's allowed in , Sir . Yes , I know . Mr. Stratton 's orders , Sir . Mr. Birnley 's orders . He gave me strict instructions , Sir . I hardly think that applies to us . Well , what are we waiting for ? Would you like to ? It 's easy . No . It must have worked . Were you here just now ? Yes . Why ? My dear boy , what 's the matter ? Nothing . It 's just that it worked . Do you mean - Just now ? Stratton , you should have - Davidson ! Oh . We 've got it , all right . Look . We 've got the answer , Mr. Birnley . We can go ahead now . Fortunately there 's a chemical change at 300 degrees centigrade . Hm . Quite remarkable . We shall have to do a little ground work on that . Seven and a half . Seven and a half . - Though as you say , - Thirty-Five . We shall only need to vary the intermediates to make a substitute for ... Wool , cotton , linen - Whatever you please . Yes , thirty-One . Thirty-One . And , of course , there 's the question of dyeing . Excuse me . Thank you . At the moment , the fiber 's intractable . It repels dye just as it does dirt . - But , uh - - We shall have to , uh , Introduce the coloring matter at an earlier stage , Left shoulder . While the polymer is still in the melt . Yes , seven . Seven . You won 't find any difficulty in stitching . The needle will simply pass through between the weave as usual . If he could let me have paper patterns of the suit . - Paper patterns ? - Yes , I shall have to have , um , Templates made and get the pieces cut out for you . Well , just as you wish . I suppose you wouldn 't prefer for us to cut them out ? Oh , I 'm afraid you wouldn 't be able to . Come in . - Well , what 's funny about it ? - It 's just the suit . It looks as if it 's wearing you . It 's still a bit luminous . But it 'll wear off . Oh , no . No ? No , it makes you look like a knight in shining armor . - That 's what you are . - Me ? Don 't you understand what this means ? Millions of people all over the world , living lives of drudgery , Fighting an endless losing battle against shabbiness and dirt . You 've won that battle for them . You 've set them free . The whole world 's going to bless you . Unbreakable ? That 's what they 're saying , Mr. Corland . Green , is - Is that possible ? Well , uh , if he 's using a heavy hydrogen , He might get a more complex molecule . In plain language - Yes or no ? It 's , uh , possible . I 'm very grateful to you , king . I - I think the ... industry will be . Get me Sir John Kierlaw . Now , now , Davidson . Hardly that , surely . Well , as soon as I have finished with the press , I should like to see the heads of all departments . Yes ? One moment , please . It 's Sir John Kierlaw . Sir John - All right . I 'll - I 'll speak to him . - He 's here . - Here ? Michael . So it was - Oh . No , no , the asthma atomizer . Now , some fool ... Has invented an indestructible cloth . - Right ? - Yes . Where is he ? How much does he want ? I 'm afraid we have Mr. Birnley to contend with first . As I understand it , Mr. Birnley intends to manufacture and market this product . - Certainly . - Are you mad ? Well , I consider it my duty to do it . It 'll knock the bottom out of everything , down to the primary producers . What about the sheep farmers and cotton growers ? The importers and middlemen . The big stores , even . It 'll ruin all of them ! The point . Let us stick to the point . - What about us ? - Well , I 'll admit some individuals ... May suffer temporarily . But I will not stand in the way of progress . The welfare of the community must come first . You 're not likely to suffer much . Michael , that 's unworthy of you . Sir John , Surely you realize this is the greatest step forward . Step forward ? Over a precipice . It means disaster . Disaster ? Was the spinning jenny a disaster ? Was the mechanical loom ? For those who didn 't control them , yes . Besides , they increased output . This will finish it . Just arriving now , Sir . He 's the one to make the complaint , isn 't he ? Well , what 's this ? - Worker 's playtime ? - It 's sid ! Look whose car . - Sid ! - Hello , Bertha . - Hello . - What have they done to you ? Well , it 's really what I 've done . - We are just going to announce it to the press . - Announce what ? - My new fiber . - Mind ! Mr. Corland . In Mr. Birnley 's office . It never gets dirty ? - And never wears out ? - That 's right . Now what do you think of him ? - And you think they 'll go ahead with it ? - Certainly . You 're not even born yet . What do you think happened to all the other things ? The razor blade that never gets blunt . And the car that runs on water , with a pinch of something in it . No . They 'll never let your stuff on the market in a million years . He 's right , you know . Vested interest . The dead hand of monopoly . It 's not like that at all , I assure you . Everything 's organized . We 're telling the newspapers this morning , And then going right ahead . But if this stuff never wears out , we 'll only have one lot to make . - That 's right . - I 've been looking everywhere for you . First of all , I want to apologize . Didn 't recognize a genius when I saw one . Excuse me , Sir . I - I 've just come from Mr. Birnley . One or two things he asked me to straighten out . That 's lovely . Six months 's work and that 'll be the lot . Every mill in the country will be laid off . It 's Birnley 's doing . Sidney wouldn 't invent a thing like that . Something oughta be done about it . Something is gonna be done . We 'll get the works committee together for a start . I don 't want to be selfish about it . Later on , I might be able to offer it to other manufacturers - Under license . You want us to cut our throats ... While you build up another fortune in royalties on our dying efforts ! Well , after all , may I point out that I control this process . - Do you ? - Of course I do . A sordid matter of details , Sir John . - Well ? - Stratton 's diary of his first successful experiment - September 15 . Stratton 's contract with Mr. Birnley - October 1 . Sir John . I expect he 's on his way to us now , but I 'll just make sure . The works committee ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Birnley 's busy . No . No , no , no , I can 't interrupt him now . No ! No ! Mr. Davidson , wait ! You can 't go there ! Sir John Kierlaw . Mr. Cranford . - How do you do ? - Mr. Mannering . - How do you do ? - Mr. Corland you know , of course . This is Mr. Stratton , gentlemen . - What 's this ? - A new contract . Sign it , young man . What was wrong with the old one ? Well , this is a big thing , Sidney . Too big for one mill . And so I decided it was necessary to bring in these other gentlemen . I see . Yes ? Mr. Birnley , it 's the works committee . They say - - No , no , I 'm busy . - It 's urgent ! It 's about Mr. Stratton . Mr. Birnley will see them later . I think it 's all in order . Thanks . Oh , that 's ingenious . - May I ? - Of course . How much petrol as against how much ink ? I really don 't know . There 's just one thing - Wilson , my assistant . He 's been a great help on this , and I 'd like him to get some of the credit . Of course . We all realize the value of Mr. Wilson 's contribution . I mean , when the results are published , I 'd like his name to be mentioned . There may be a little delay in publication , of course . Delay ? Oh . Why ? You see , Sidney , we have to wait till the right moment . - Why not now ? - To announce it right away ... Might upset the delicate balance of the market . Would it ? But what happens when you begin to sell the stuff ? Leave these problems to us , Mr. Stratton . - Just sign the document . - Sir John 's right , Sidney . You are going ahead with production ? Well , Sidney , I - - I 'd like to think this over . - Young man , come here . We need control of this discovery . Complete control . If you want twice the amount in that contract , we 'll pay it . A quarter of a million . - To suppress it ? - Yes . Excuse me . Wait ! Now listen , all of you ! Sidney ! Sidney ! Stop him ! This is too much no , no , no , wait . Wait , please , all of you . - Yes , Mr. Birnley ? - S - S-Sidney , no ! - I beg your pardon , Mr. Birnley ? - Miss Johnson , there 's a room - Stop him ! Sidney , stop that ! Look here . You can 't - Stop a minute ! Stop him ! Stop him ! Stop him ! For goodness sake , stop him ! Stop him . He - He mustn 't leave the mill . - How can we stop him ? - By force . - By force ? - How else ? - I will not resort to violence . If he sells to anybody else , he ruins us all . Then we must reason with the boy . How can we reason with him when he 's not here ? Yes , Sir ? This way , gentlemen . Oh , I 'm sorry . Wrong floor ! Is he all right ? - Yes . - Pity . Any news of him ? He 's up at Birnley 's . What did I tell ya ? Right in their pocket . You 've no right to talk like that . Perhaps he can 't help himself . - They say he had a headache . - Aye , sticks out a mile . Birnley won 't see the works committee and sid can 't face us . There . Mr. Stratton lives here ? Yes , but , uh - Now he 's going to live with Mr. Birnley . I 've come to collect his baggage . Also , to give you two weeks ' rent . Now who 's right ? It 's just as I told you . Sitting right in their laps . - Well , give me some figures . - Fallen to what ? 46.9 ? No , no , no , no . No , don 't sell . No , of course not . There 's not a word of truth in it . Yes , yes . I 'll be on - On here till further notice . Well , that 's just the beginning . Hello , yes ? Yeah ? Calcutta ? Tomorrow 'll be a nosedive . Just on these rumors . It 's absurd . There must have been a leakage . - Well , you should know , you started the first one . - It 's no good your blaming me - - You know very well - Sir John 's right . Let 's keep to the point , shall we ? All right , put him on . There 's only one thing that will put the market together , And that is a denial backed with suppression - Total and permanent . - Hello , Mottram . - How ? We 've already offered him a quarter of a million . Well , we can 't keep him here forever . There are one or two laws in the country . I 've got it . Maybe I should talk to him , let him name his own price . I think not , Michael . I will - Gentlemen ! Gentlemen . Knudsen ? His door 's locked . The key 's gone . I have it , miss Birnley . I 'm sorry , miss Birnley . No one goes in , he doesn 't come out . Mr. Birnley 's instructions . There 's no sense in pursuing this boy with money ! It means nothing to him ! - What else could ? - Yes , yes , yes . Put him on , will you ? Women ? He didn 't seem to me to be the type . It 's often that type that , um - Very true . If we could just find a friend of his . I mean , someone who knew the best way to talk to him . Father ? What 's going on ? What have you been doing to Sidney ? Now , really , Daphne , it 's no concern of yours . I want to know just exactly what you 've done to Sidney . - W - Will you please - - I 'm sorry , father - - This is a very important business meeting . - Miss Birnley , just a minute . Stand by the phone , will you ? I 'll ring you back . Um , miss Birnley , I take it you know Mr. Stratton quite well ? How well ? We 're very good friends . Why not ? Why not ? It may be very useful to us . I thought I told you - Mr. Birnley ? Oh , it 's for you . - Hello ? - Sit down , miss Birnley . No , Davidson , I cannot . Miss Birnley , We 're trying to buy the world rights to Mr. Stratton 's new discovery . But he doesn 't seem to trust us . Doesn 't he ? Why not ? Miss Birnley , you 're the daughter of an industrialist . You must realize how reckless exploitation ... Of anything new would upset the delicate balance of trade . You understand that ? I am beginning to . Good . Good . You want to suppress it . But , gentlemen , if you aren 't able to persuade him , why should I be able to ? Uh , all men are susceptible , miss Birnley . I need hardly tell you that you 're a very attractive girl . Thank you . Tell them I 'll see them tomorrow . Well , Michael , what do you say ? It 's a desperate situation , Daphne , For the whole industry . Yes . Yes , I 'm beginning to realize that . There 's no need to explain what 's at stake . When I tell you we 've already offered stratton a quarter of a million , - You can see for yourself . - I can , indeed . But , since we 're on the subject of price , what do I get out of it ? - Miss Birnley ! - Daphne ! I haven 't had much experience with these sort of things , But I 've always understood it was comparatively well paid . Now , miss Birnley - This isn 't anything to joke about . I suggest 2,000 . Aren 't you rating my value a little low ? Wouldn 't 5,000 be fairer ? - Five thousand . Agreed . - Agreed . - It 's a pleasure to do business with you , Sir John . - Well , Daphne ? And about time too . I want to talk to you , Sidney . I never thought you would be on their side . You may not believe me , Sidney , but I want what 's best for you . I - I don 't like this any more than you do . I hate this town . The mill , everything . People who think of nothing but moneygrubbing . - Don 't you feel like that ? - Yes . I want to get away , Sidney . I want to see something of the world beyond this dirty little town . To make a life for myself where there are people who know the way to live . Italy , maybe . France ? Well , why don 't you ? I can 't . But you could . And you could take me . How ? I know what they offered you . You could live the rest of your life on it . Go anywhere . Do as you please . And if you want me , I 'd come too . What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . No . Not even if it means me ? - No . - Thank you , Sidney . What for ? If you 'd said yes , I 'd have strangled you . Now , we 've got to get that suit to the newspapers . Show it to them and tell them the whole story . That will blow the lid off everything , and they 'll never get it back on . But how ? Would you stake your life on this ? You can issue a categorical denial to the press . The stuff does not exist . It has never been invented . It never could be . There is no panic here whatsoever . Certainly Mr. Birnley will confirm that . No , no , no . Good heavens , Davidson , I told you to deal with them in your own way . Yes , Mr. Birnley . - They 've come out . - What ? - On strike . - Strike ? - They 've got the whole mill out . I tried to get you on the telephone , but you kept on being engaged . Well , you better get them back at all costs . Otherwise , there 'll be a landslide . - Landslide ? - Now , Mr. Birnley , I - - Then go and do something ! - They want a guarantee we 're not going into production . - But , we 're not intending to . - Good heavens , man , that 's what we 're out to prevent . Yes , I know . But they won 't take one 's word for anything . Oh , this is insanity ! They 're afraid of being out of work and so they down tools . What am I to do ? Get them up here . Up to the house . I 'll talk to them . Well , what are you waiting for ? But what guarantee can we give them ? We don 't control the thing . Oh , I don 't know . Sir John - It 's only a matter of five pence . You 're very unreasonable . - Excuse me . - Right ? - Can you let me have five pence ? No coppers at all . Well , more would do . I 've got three and eleven , but I want four and four . I 've got to get to Manchester . I could more than pay you back as soon as I 've done it . I could give you £ 100 . I 've got some money at my digs . Better get it then . Kierlaw or anyone else . And Frank 'll - It 's Sid ! Hey ! Wait for me ! Sid ! Sid , I want to talk to you . Can 't talk now , gotta find a shilling . Sid , where are you going ? Your room 's lent . - Where 's that vase ? - Who are you ? Sid , the room 's let to some old geezer . Oh , I beg your pardon . What 's going on ? Will you please kindly leave this room ? - Oh , Sid . - Sorry . Sid , I knew you 'd turn out right in the end . - They tried to soften you up . - They locked me in the attic . - Oh , you can 't tell me . Human life means nothing to ' em , but you got away . I must go now . Don 't you worry . They won 't get at you again . I 'm going up to a meeting there now . Wait till I tell them . What a trump card . Thanks , Bertha . But there 's a train to Manchester at 8 : 13 . - Manchester ? What for ? - To give it to the newspapers the whole story . Here , wait a minute . What story ? The whole thing . My invention and how people tried to stop it . But they 're not going to . Sid ! Whose side are you on ? The same as you . Don 't you understand ? They want to stop it . So do we . Sid , listen . No , Sid . Sid , don 't go ! Sid - Now , look , Sid . Sid ! Will you please stop ? Please , stop . Stop it . Stop it . I 'll fetch Mrs. Watson . Here , you can 't do that . That 's my room . Open that door . Let me out of here . Let him out of there . Not likely . All right , I 'll fetch the police . Hey ! Wait a minute ! Let me out ! Bertha ! What 's up ? Harry , stay here . Don 't let either of them escape . Eh ? Sid 's gone mad . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . He 's got us all muddled up with Birnley . This is beyond belief , gentlemen . And if Sir John was suggesting ... What I could hardly believe he could be suggesting - Now , my dear Birnley , Let your daughter deal with stratton in her own way . - After all , she went into it with her eyes open . - Well , I didn 't . Yes ? The works committee is here . Oh , well - Well , show them up . N - Now , Birnley - B - Birnley , listen - Who is that ? It 's me , daddy . Daphne , I-I just wondered if you were still there . Yes , I 'm still here . Daphne , I-I want to talk to you . Not now , father . Daphne . Birnley , don 't be ridiculous . But she 's locked in . Crazy or not , we 've got him . We 'll get some sense into him . Daphne ! Open-Open the door , please . Daphne , open this door . Daphne ! No . Knudsen ? Ladies and gentlemen , Sir John will now explain to you the situation . We 're talking to Mr. Birnley . No one else . Mr. Birnley will be along in a few minutes . He better come now . And we 'll do the explaining . You see , the boot 's on the other foot now . Now that Sidney stratton 's with us . W - With you ? That 's right . Sidney 's apologies . But , from now on , you 'll just have to , um , count him out . - Hello . - Hello . Who 's that ? - Well , what is it ? - You know , there 's a man in that room . I know that . Well , he 's got out . Eh ? He went that way . All right . Thank you . - Good-Bye . - Here , let me out of here . Let me - Listen ! What are we arguing for ? Nobody wants to market it . - Quite right . - My dear friends , You must see that our bone of contention is nonexistent . Capital and labor are hand in hand in this . Once again , as so often in the past , each needs the help of the other . - Mr. Birnley ? - Yes ? - Can I speak to Bertha ? - Who ? - Bertha . Is somebody called Bertha ? - Who is it ? - It 's me , Bertha , Harry . - Harry , you ... - I don 't know how he did it . There were bars on the window . - And the kid said he got out . When I went in , he 'd gone ! - What ! We 'll get him at the station ! Michael ! - Corland ? Corland , you take your car , I 'll take mine . - Right ! - Frank , you 're not going with them . - They 're not going without me . They 're not going to take me for a ride . Wait for me . Wait . Wait . Wait . Okay , ducks . Room for one more inside . There he is ! - There . - All right , boys , get after him . The other way ! Cut him off ! There ! Come on , lads . There 's a light bobbing up and down over there . That 's not a light , it 's sid . There he is ! Well , cheerio , Alf . There he is ! After him , lads . Come on . After him ! Hey ! What 's the matter ? Dad ! What 've you been doing ? Nothing . Hello . That way . Here , don 't you know there 's a strike on ? Now , listen , there 'll only be trouble if you stay here . It 's the stability . It isn 't stable . Mrs. Watson , have you got something ? My suit , they can see me . Why can 't you scientists leave things alone ? What about my bit of washing when there 's no washing to do ? There he is , lads ! There he is . - There ! - There he is . All right , lads . We got him . The work , it 's coming to pieces ! We 're saved ! Look ! Look ! Sir John ! Sir John ! Look ! Look ! Look , it 's funny . Look ! Here , lad , wear this . The crisis is over now . The news of Sidney 's failure brought relief to the world . I see . It had been a hard and bitter experience for all of us . But we faced the future with confidence . We have seen the last of Sidney Stratton . I see . At least , I hope we 've seen the last of him .

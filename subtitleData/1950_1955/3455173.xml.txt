Somebody , help me ! Somebody , help me ! please , help me . Somebody ... help me ! I 'm alive ! Somebody , help me , please ! I 'm michael . michael Rogan . What 's your name ? It is you . AII these weeks I was beginning to think I was the only one left . Now , I don 't know . Where are you from ? I was born in Rhode island . school , Dartmouth . A Master of Arts in english Literature . Gave me diction and a job as a barker on the Empire State building . Empire State building . " We are now situated on a point 102 stories in the air , " on the highest , Ioftiest , man-made edifice in all the world . " Home of the Bronx , brooklyn , Queens , Staten island ... " Now , that 's where I was when it all began . I ran for the elevators , something hit me . I woke up . It was all over . I was the only one alive . In all of New York , the only one alive . I began to run . It was a nightmare . The whole United States , wherever there had been people , that infernal radioactive dust , it choked and it killed and it ... But there comes an end to running . Where were you ? Where ... I 'm going hunting . I go every day . There 's nothing to hunt , but I go anyway . I never had it so good . A house , food , no problems . Have you been sitting here all day ? Come on inside . Do you want to get sicker ? You sure you don 't want more ? I want to tell you . I was in the hospital . They took me into the X-ray room . AII of a sudden , there was a strange noise . I don 't know what happened after that . When I woke up , I was Iying on the bed . Drink . I still don 't know your name . Roseanne . The lead shield around the X-ray room . That 's what saved you . Why did you come here ? My mother 's sister lives ... Lived here . She was an artist . I came here one summer . I was so happy , I never forgot . Who was the man in the picture ? Steven . Husband ? Yes . Do you mind if I stay here a little longer ? I thought maybe I 'd never see anyone again . Good morning . Good morning . I 've been waiting for you to get up . I 've gotta go get food . There 's a country store down the road . It 's about a mile , so I 'II be gone for a while . No . Take me with you . AII right . people . Where are the people ? There should be people ! - Where are the people ? - Stop thinking about it ! Stop thinking about it ! You hear me ? Stop it ! New York , cleveland , Chicago ... What I saw there was enough to crack my head open , but I stopped thinking about it . I 'd look at it , and I wouldn 't see it . That 's the only way , the world that never was . Not even a mouse . These country stores , you got anything . Take what you want . Remember how important box tops used to be ? My ma , that was her big dream . Tear off a box top , write 20 witty words and own the world . mail it in with 10 cents in stamps , and you 'II get rich , fat and famous . Here , madam , tear off a box top . Come on , Iet 's get what we need and get out of here . It 's getting cold out . I got enough for all night . AII those years in New York , and I never saw the moonlight . I hated New York . It was like a trap holding . When I was a kid , we were so poor , hungry poor . Up in the country , hunger 's different , but in the city , everything there , only a piece of glass between you and what you need . It 's done with . Roseanne , what about us ? No , no , no ! You little fool , there 's only us . Steven ! He 's dead . I 'm here . Stop ! I 've got his baby in me ! I 've got his baby ! I 'm almost out of everything . - Get you some stuff tomorrow . - Take me with you . Let 's go to the city . Maybe Steven 's alive . I don 't know , but I 've got to know . Soon I won 't be able to walk so far , but I 'm all right now . please , Iet 's go there tomorrow . Why don 't you answer me ? Do you want to kill yourself and it ? Through some miracle , we 're safe here , but in the city , how do you know what would happen to you and ... But I 've got to know about Steven . AII right , I 'II tell you . He 's dead . They 're all dead . Everyone ! You and I are in a dead world . And I 'm glad it 's dead ! Cheap , honky-tonk of a world . Wait ! - I never expected to see anyone . - Why , neither did I. A young lady . I am oliver B. BarnstapIe . I am assistant cashier at the Santa Barbara bank . How do you do ? How do you do ? miracle . When we saw that smoke in the sky from your chimney ... Another hour , and it wouId have been too dark . Was it pretty rough ? The fire feels good . Yes , it was pretty rough . First getting locked in the vault , air got pretty bad . He 's a pretty old man . Then when I found the inside release for the time lock mechanism ... Then we got out , then we found everybody , everybody he 'd worked with all those years . It wasn 't easy on him either . I grabbed a jeep . I used to drive one in the Army . We just went off . Went around in circles , I guess . I wasn 't exactly what you 'd call normal , either , for a while . I 'd always seen the dead in their coffins . - Anyone want some more ? - I am most content . full up . delicious and delightful . But tomorrow we must be on our way , eh , charles ? Yes , indeed , vacations are delightful , but one has obligations to one 's work . Sirius , Jupiter . I once bought a book on the constellations . An impractical investment . I never got a chance to look at it . We 're quite an institution , you know , three quarters of a million in capitalization . Do you mind if I stroll out on the point and look at the glories of nature ? One must enjoy one 's vacation while one can , you know . Of course . - Be careful , sir . - I 'II be quite all right . I want to say something . What I said before , I don 't know whether it 's true anymore . We 're alive , now those two . I don 't know . I got a place fixed up down there . I think perhaps Mr. BarnstapIe had better stay here tonight . No , my dear young lady . No , indeed . For 40 years I 've wanted to sleep under the stars . I never did , you know . It gets quite cold here . It 's all right , there 's a couch . Come along . I am tired . - It won 't embarrass you ? - No . On the way , did you see anything alive ? Just a few birds . He keeps talking about bank statements . Yes , ma 'am . Before he got sick , he was a pretty bright man in his cage , Mr. BarnstapIe was , but when he got out , found all the people he 'd been working with just lying there , well , you might say he was sort of like a machine with no one left to press the buttons . - We 'II take care of him . - Yes , ma 'am . - charles ? - Yes , ma 'am ? Did you have a family ? Yes , ma 'am . excellent investment , a house . What 's your husband 's business ? - He 's an architect . - excellent , excellent . We do a great deal of business with architects and builders . Our escrow department is most efficient . Did I faII down ? I don 't remember . I must have bruised myself . I seem to be bleeding under my skin . Many places . I think it 's radiation poisoning . How do you know that ? I don 't know . I 'm guessing . But after Hiroshima , the magazines ran pictures . It looks the same . - But you 're not sure ? - No , I 'm not sure . Good morning . - How 's the laundry business ? - I can 't turn off the faucet . How is he ? sleeping . Three days sleeping . charles , can you give me a hand ? Okay . Madam , I hereby tender my resignation . I am entering the broader field of the building trade . Miss , Miss Roseanne . - Where 'd you get all this wood ? - Forestry station , two valleys over . There 's an electric generator over there . - Is that a fact ? - Yeah . electric light . Now , that would be something . Then maybe we could find me a washing machine . Then I couId fix me up a meter , send me a bill every month . Of course , I wouldn 't pay it , so that would force me to disconnect myself . Did you ever stop to think ? A world without any bills . charles , charles ! Hi . michael , charles . - What 's the matter ? - He 's awake and he wants to go down to the ocean . Ocean ? What are you talking about ? He seems perfectly rational , but he says he wants to go down to the ocean right away . Oh , yes . - I think he 's better . - Yes . - How about you ? - I 'm fine . I 've never asked you before , but I 've got to , so here goes , when does ... I 'm not sure . Three months maybe . Did I ever tell you ? When I was a very young man , I always wanted to go to sea . I don 't remember why I didn 't . He 'II be all right . Coney island . What did you say ? I was thinking of Coney island on a day like this . Do you know Coney island ? There 's people . Hundreds of thousands of them , jammed together , body to body , trying to get a little sun , a little fresh air , and I with them . I still see it . What 's the matter with me ? michael ! michael ! Come on ! Last driftwood on the beach . How do you feel now , mister ? The last survivors . I have listened to the stories of your individual miracles . Now I 'II tell you of mine . I was on the mountain when it happened . The mountain . Everest . surely you heard of our exploration . No matter . I alone . It was a great blizzard . For five days , I was marooned on the final ridge . When I returned to the base camp , 5,000 feet below , they were all dead . I made my way across Asia , to the coast . Again , I was the only living thing . I found a boat . I went to Hawaii . Again , a mountain of dead . I found a plane . I decided to try America . I ran out of petrol a few hours ago . I climbed Mount Everest . I alone . always alone . Now there are you . We are quite the community . Mike , Roseanne , come here ! What was wrong ? He just died . I 'II stay . You come back for us . No . I 'II bury him here . You take Roseanne home . No , I 'II stay . - Don 't you think you 'd better come along ? - No . charles , it 's all right . He loved the sea . She shouIdn 't be climbing up and down that hill . She wants to feed the man . He 's not that sick ! What 's gonna be with Roseanne when her time comes ? I don 't know . If my old father could see me now . Why ? He used to wave the bible at me and say , " In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread . " How about the bank ? No sweat of your face ? " Good morning , Mr. Harrison . Good morning , Mr. Adams . " Good morning , Mr. PaImer . " What did you want to do , charles ? I wanted to be a teacher . Why didn 't you ? Lost my way somewhere , I guess . First a girl , a decent suit , then after a while , I guess , what I wanted more than anything else was a little piece of security , 9 : 30 to 4 : 00 , $ 38.50 a week , every week . Security . well , how is the agricultural project going ? We don 't know if the seed will grow . Why not ? Things are so strange . Birds , no animals . So many things I don 't understand . - How do you feel ? - Fine . I think I 'd better see how the farmers are doing . Isn 't that a misdirection of energy ? Why this return to primitiveness ? The shelves of the cities are bursting with food , a lifetime of food . michael doesn 't want to go near the cities . Do you want to stay here ? I have to now . I mean , after your child . I think I will try to get up tomorrow . That 's wonderful , Eric . You 're very sweet . Everybody , come on ! Hurry , come on ! - Take it easy . - What could it be ? It 's growing at last . So . Pretty good for city folks , huh ? Corn on the cob . I was a fool . That long , terrible trip to reach here , endless days at sea , alone , always alone . Now I have found my civilization . As long as things keep growing , everything will be all right . Yes , I know . Nature so arranges it that when a woman is in your condition , clouds are like rainbows and all the world is like a cradle . Hey , they 're on ! They 're on ! How wonderful ! Music . I wanted it so much . We found a hundred records . I wish I couId dance . Me ! You sit . I 'II do it for you . It 'II keep burning . There 's plenty of gas in the generator . I keep thinking how I never saw the lights . AII my Iife in the city , and I never saw them . Very nice ! And here I thought you were sewing booties . - It is very nice . - Thank you . You have done enough work for one day . Come outside and talk to me . I 'd Iike to finish the sewing . That corn out of the can was mighty tasty tonight . The blessing of our age , the American canning industry . And yet , it debased your taste down to the level of baked beans and hash . I didn 't notice any leftover beans on your plate tonight . When in Rome , eat swiII like the Romans . I 'd Iike to go places tonight and have a big time , order a doubIe-decker hamburger with onions , a side order of French fries and a double chocolate malt . Spareribs . Barbecued spareribs . I can smell them . I 'd Iike strawberries , strawberries and cream . Where I lived , the smell of traffic . From morning to night , you could smell the traffic . telephone . If I couId hear a telephone ringing ... A New York cop , even a New York cop bawIing out a hack driver . Where I lived , the faucet was always dripping . If I couId just hear that dripping . Of all those things , which would you Iike the most ? I don 't know . Kids raising the devil around the supper table . I hardly think this is the time for nostalgic sentimentality . I 've been giving a great deal of thought to why we are alive . Of course , there 's a definite primary reason why he and you and I escaped the radiation . I was at a tremendous height and you two behind metal at the bank vault , the X-ray room . And , yet , what about you ? You had no such protection . And what about the old man who died in spite of having the same protection as this one had ? The answer to me is obvious . Immunity . simply because there is something within our bodies , a chemistry which gives us special immunity to that which killed the others . I see the doubtful look on your faces . Then mark this , during the middle Ages , when the black plague swept all Europe , when man died by the hundreds of thousands , why didn 't all mankind die ? The deadly organisms were there . There was no protection against them , and yet a small percentage of people lived on , as we have lived with the rest of the world of men dropping dead around them . The answer then was immunity to the organisms , and the answer here today is immunity against the radiation . If what you say is true , then there are others . Of course . Throughout the world there will be others who have our sort of immunity . Not many , only a few perhaps , but very definitely existing as we are here . Some will die from the lingering radiations , but a small number will live as we have lived . - That gives you hope , doesn 't it ? - Yes . well , that 's just a theory , and a theory 's just a bunch of words set front to back . But a theory becomes a fact with proof , and that is the very reason we should go into the cities and look for these people who might be alive . We 'II never know waiting here . She will never know if her husband is dead or alive . Tomorrow will be a good day to start . Don 't you agree ? She 's not well enough to travel . Anyway , we 're safe here . We don 't know what would happen to us in the cities . michael , I was thinking , with your primitive mind and timidity , in a few years , you 'II be swinging from the branches of the trees . fortunately , I , and I believe I speak for Roseanne as well , am not quite satisfied with this return to nature of yours . Not when the cities are open , waiting treasure chests . Everything in the world is there for us , everything for the taking . And beyond that , what of the others who are alive ? I want to get them together in one place . Why ? So they can beat their heads on the ground for King Eric the First ? - The man who climbed Mount Everest ? - michael , I do want to go to the city . If we drive carefully , I 'II be all right . But you won 't be all right . Don 't you understand ? It 's the cities themselves . Where the bombs fell , the radiations are thickest . Why don 't you listen to me ? He talks about immunity . Have you got immunity to dead , piled up like cordwood with the flesh off their bones ? I want to know what 's happened out there , too , but Mike 's right . We don 't know what would happen there . We know we 're all right here . Who , in God 's name , asked you your opinion ? But I 'm talking to her . And I 'm telling you to shut up . I 've had enough of this interference . Where have I interfered with you ? That is the question . Your very presence is distasteful to me , that I must eat with you , sleep under the same roof with you . - Now it 's out . - Now it 's out . No , in this world , you must face reality . It is a mistake he is alive . AII right , Iet him go live somewhere else , not with you , not with me ! Do you hear me ? I want you out of here now . No ! Eric ! It 's like it never was before . " And God stepped out on space " And He looked around and said 'I 'm lonely , I 'II make me a worId' " Then God smiled And the light broke " And the darkness rolled up on one side " And the light stood shining on the other " And God said , ' That 's good ! ' " Then God reached out and took the light in His hands " And God rolled the light around in His hands " until He made the sun " And He set that sun a-bIazing in the heavens " And the light that was left from making the sun " God gathered it in a shining ball And flung it against the darkness " SpangIing the night with the moon and the stars " Then down between The darkness and the light " He hurled the world " And God said , ' That 's good ! ' " Then the green grass sprouted " And the pine tree pointed his finger to the sky " The lakes cuddIed down in the hollows of the ground " And the rivers ran down to the sea " And up from the bed of the river God scooped the clay " And by the bank of the river He kneeled Him down " And there the great God almighty Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky " Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night " Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand " This Great God " Like a mother bending over her baby KneeIed down in the dust " ToiIing over a lump of clay till He had shaped it in His own image " Then into it He blew the breath of Iife " And man became a living soul " Amen " Here he is . He . Thank you , michael . I still think you should be in bed . Listen , mister , who 's the doctor on this case ? That 's right . Don 't argue with a specialist . michael , is that the baby ? I 'II go see . - He was snoring . - He was not . It 's all right . I told him to turn over . Roseanne , when are you gonna give him a name ? Soon , I hope . Why not now ? This is as good a time as any . You can 't keep on calling him " Baby . " How about Guthrie or glenn or Leroy ? Yeah , or ralph or SyIvester or NathanieI or Gustaf ... No ! I don 't want to name him now . I want to wait until I find out about his father . Does your shoulder still hurt ? No , it 's doing fine . Where 's Eric ? He took the jeep early this morning and went off somewhere . I think we better talk about him now . He seems to think the fact he 's sorry settles everything . As far as I 'm concerned , nothing 's settled . Maybe the answer is for me to go away . Look , we 've got too little a world left to run away . We 're here , all of us . Eric 's got to understand that once and for all , and right away . - And what if he doesn 't ? - Then he 's got to get out . Don 't you agree ? I don 't know . I don 't think it 's right . You said there can 't be anymore running away , and you 're right . At the same time , have we the right to send anyone away ? Anyway , the way I 've got it figured out , it isn 't me or you he hates . He 's right , michael . well , this is an occasion . - How do you feel ? - AII right . I brought you a few things . Thank you . I found a place over the ridge . Some wealthy man built himself quite a beautiful place . Many things there we could use . - We 've been talking about you . - Is that a fact ? I think I 'II go in . Thank you , charles . Thank you for the things . Not at all . It 's very nice to see you up and about . Thank you . I 'd Iike to talk to you . - Yes ? - I said we 've been talking about you . You 're repetitious . Listen , Eric . Maybe we 're the only ones left on Earth , and , well , maybe it 's true there are others left besides us . Either way , it 's like the world was starting all over again . We 've got a new chance to make the world what everybody used to talk about . We 've got that chance , Iet 's make the most of it . Let 's not make the mistakes they did , the millions of them . Let 's not be at each other 's throats . Let 's work together , live together , Iike friends . May I have a cigarette ? Look , michael , we 've all been living under a great state of tension . That is my only excuse for what happened , but I think it is a valid one . The tensions are over . What more can I say ? I 've got to fix the roof tomorrow . will you give me a hand ? Of course . - Do you need help unloading the jeep ? - Yes . - I 'II give you a hand . - Thank you . I 'II be with you in a moment . That crazy idiot . Why does he do it ? Some people have to climb mountains to justify their existence . Sit in the shade . How about you ? Aren 't you happy here ? Yes . We could be happy now . I 'm full of so many things to say to you , I lost them all . Roseanne , listen . I 'm just an ordinary guy who happens to be here . I thought I was alone , and it didn 't matter much . people hadn 't meant much to me . When you first got here , well , you were just a woman , but now you 're Roseanne . I think of you when I work , when I plan , so much I want to do . michael . Those filthy scavengers . I saw them in the city . It 's getting late . It 's charles ! What 's he doing down here ? The baby ! charles , is the baby all right ? Is the baby all right ? Sure . sleeping . Eric ? I saw him from the terrace . - deliberately drove the jeep through it . - charles ! - Is he all right ? - Yes . - How terrible ! How did ... - animal . We don 't know what kind . - Why did you do it ? - Why did I do what ? charles worked like a dog to make it grow . Why did you do it ? AII the food we could possibly want is in a thousand warehouses . If the man persists in working like an animal , Iet him work . I was tired . I took the short route back . Get out ! Get out now ! I 'II go . In my own time . It sure is hot tonight . Sure wish we could find us an electric dishwasher . We 're going to get dishpan hands . I told him to get out . What did he say ? He showed me a gun and said he 'd leave in his own time . He 's sleeping . Did you finish the dishes ? AII starched and ironed . Why didn 't Eric come up for dinner tonight ? Guess he went off somewhere . well , he 'II never know what he missed . What 's the matter ? Was there ground glass in the soup ? No . That was a mighty fine dinner . I 'm just so full I haven 't got any room for conversation . Good night , everybody . - Good night , charles . - Good night , charles . What 's the matter , michael ? I want to tell you something . What you said today made me very happy , like I used to be . I forgot everything except being alive , being with you . Oh , Steven . - Yes ? - Eric . I 've got to talk to you right away . - I 'm very tired , Eric . - I 'm going away tonight . - Tonight ? - Yes . I 've got to find out once and for all about those other people . I owe it to them . I owe it to myself . - will you be back ? - Yes . Of course . In a few days . And then I 'II know once and for all where we stand . Your husband , if I find him , I 'II bring him back with me . We 're a group of living miracles , why not he ? Yes . What am I talking about ? I don 't even know what he looks like . I 'II go with you . I have the jeep packed at the bend of the road . ShouIdn 't we tell ? No , definitely no . michael , who knows what he will do or say ? Now we can go without any quarreling , come back , there 'II be no trouble at all , but of course we 'II take the child . Come . Pack your things . I 'II meet you at the jeep in 20 minutes . AII right ? - Yes . - Good . I thought I was the only one who couldn 't sleep . Where you going ? What 's wrong ? What 's happening up there ? It 's all right , darling . We 'II be going soon . I 'm sorry . It took longer than I thought . Was anyone awake ? No . well , we 're really on our way . Too bad you can 't drive . Let me sleep until I wake up . Roseanne ! Roseanne ! Steven ! Steven ! Where have you been ? Get in ! Get in ! You should have been with me . I told you , the whole world , a waiting treasure chest . could we go now ? I 'II get something better . Ever think you 'd own the world ? - CouIdn 't we go back now ? - Back where ? You little fool . I got you away . You don 't think I 'm gonna take you back ? I 'II get another car . Where do you think you 're going ? Get back in that car . Come on ! Stay with me as long as I want you ! What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? There 's nothing . There 's nothing . There 's nothing ! Roseanne ! Roseanne ! My baby 's dead . If you could cry . I want to help you . Subtitles ripped by tiger6ex ( c ) BitShock.org TEAM

 [ music playing ] NARRATOR : Strained ... The monstrous assurance of this race of puny bipeds with overblown egos , the creature who calls himself man . He believes he owns the Earth and every living thing on it exists only for his benefit . Yet how foolish he is . Consider , even the lowly insect that man trods underfoot outweighs humanity several times and outnumbers by countless billions . In the continuing war for survival between man and the hexapods , only an utter fool would bet against the insect . Let a man or woman venture from the well beaten path of civilization . Let him cross the threshold of the limited intellect , and he encounters amazing , wondrous things ... The unknown and terrible . If he escapes these weird adventures with his life , he will usually find he left his reason behind him . Perhaps that is what happened to these two souls , lost in the great Mexican desert . But then ask yourself , why would anyone trod from the usually well traveled roads of this modern age , from the luxury of an air conditioned automobile ? It 's difficult for our modern world of statistics and electronics to accept miracles . But you could almost call this a miracle ... a genuine miracle . Out of hundreds and thousands of square miles of heat and seared wasteland , where the vultures wait for the other vultures to die , an American oil surveyor has chosen to explore this particular terrible corner of the earth , the Muerto Desert ... The Desert of Death . This surveyor can hardly credit his eyes . Perhaps they 're only illusive images produced by roasting the optic nerves . But if they do exist ... If they are living things from somewhere ... One fact is certain . Miracle or not , they will not be living things for long . The Muerto Desert , true to its name , will soon convert them into dead things . [ man panting ] Maybe he 's coming out of it , then . I 've got it , Doc . Even if they got across that desert alive , the sun 's bound to have cooked their brains . It 's a miracle to me old Pepe and Frank found them . Now I 'd be getting back to work . Beats me how they got there or what they were doing . That 's the most god-forsaken spot on earth . Maybe they 're from that missing plane we read about . That plane was headed for Mexico City . It 'd have to be 100 degrees off to land in the Muerto Desert . 100 degrees or not , they had to come from somewhere . Where did you say you picked them up , Pepe ? On the road to Zarpa Mesa , Senor Medico . [ woman moans ] DOC : Pretty girl under all that sunburn . She was almost completely dehydrated . I don 't know what kept them alive . You 're all right . You 're safe . You 're in an oil company office . You sure ? She 's in about the same shape you are . She hasn 't come out of it yet , but I think you 're both going to be all right . Here , try to take this . [ coughing ] Who did you think you were anyway , Superman ? Super ... Nobody 's ever been able to walk across that desert and come out alive . And you try it with a girl . You said this was an oil company . Can you load a truck with full drums and bring all the men you can spare ? If we get there in time , maybe we can ... Can what ? Burn them out before they scatter . That 's the only thing that scares them ... fire . But if we 're too late , we 're ... Now just a minute , young fella . Take it easy . You 've been out in the sun too long . That sedative will quiet him down in a minute . I tell you , you don 't know . You haven 't seen them . But if you had , you 'd realize ... Seen them ? Look , you said Superman . Well these are super monsters or bugs as big as we are . They can ... the can ... they can kill you with one bite . DAN : What can ? MAN : These ... these ... These things . I ... if they scatter before we get there , we 're ... Where do they come from ? He 's got a ... an underground lab up on Zarpa Mesa . He does something to their glands . Who does ? Doctor Aranya . Aranya ? Ay , caramba ! I told you the sun had cooked their brains . Pepe doesn 't think so . And besides , nobody 's ever been able to climb Zarpa Mesa . But you can reach it by plane . Let 's listen to his story anyway . What do we got to lose ? It all started on the border a few days back . I pilot for Jan van Croft , the big financier . Well , we had engine trouble , and I ... I made a forced landing in the ... the field outside this little Mexican town . After we landed , I stayed with the ... with the ship to ... NARRATOR : Quite a sorry he 's telling , isn 't it , Pepe ? You heard from your people about Zarpa Mesa , and the mysterious Doctor Aranya , even though your bosses haven 't . So why tell them ? They would only laugh at you and say , poor Pepe , you 're getting old . But you heard for years about the grotesque and misshapen people , about the women ... Strange women who do not die . No , Grant Philip doesn 't know the whole story . You see , he came into it late . It actually began , oh , almost a year ago , the night Dr. Leland Masterson , the world famous specialist and researcher , found himself in the middle of the Muerto Desert , the Desert of Death . He came in answer to a rather mysterious summons from a man he admired but knew only as a name signed to a series of brilliant scientific treatises ... Aranya . Well , we 've arrived . NARRATOR : Your eyes must be playing tricks on you in this light . Is that what you think , Masterson ? What was it you thought you saw ? Apparently , they 've come correctly . But , uh , to Masterson it seems strange ... a man with the genius of Aranya building his laboratory on an inaccessible mountain top in the middle of an uninhabited desert . Why Zarpa Mesa ? Why Zarpa Mesa , indeed ! A natural question , doctor . And one that was soon to be answered , though in a way so fantastic and horrible as to make a man of science doubt his senses . How do you do ? My name is Masterson ... Dr. Leland Masterson . I believe Dr. Aranya is expecting me . Nervous systems of insects . Dr. Masterson ? Dr. Aranya ? I trust your journey was pleasant . Well , moderately . I must confess , though , that I was a trifle uneasy when your driver headed into the Muerto Desert . But everything seems to have worked out . The sentimental human mind being what it is , this is the only sort of a place I could find to carry on my work . But I can understand your feelings . These papers on the anterior lobe of the pituitary and the effects of the specific hormones on other living things ... quite the most remarkable endocrine theories that I 've ever read . Well thank you , doctor ... Coming from the world 's foremost organo-therapist , a fine complement . That 's why I jumped at the chance to come here , work with you , examine your theories . Oh , let us understand one thing , Doctor . These are not theories . Not theories ? I have successfully proved every point over and over again in my laboratory . MASTERSON : Wait a minute . You want me to believe that you have produce these things by experimentation ? And many more . Then my eyes weren 't playing tricks . So you can see why such work as this must be completed inside a mountaintop amidst this desolation . Oh , I 'm completing a most unusual experiment in my laboratory , Doctor . Would you care to observe ? Oh , certainly ! Then come along . [ machinery humming ] Only a matter of minutes now . What is the na ... Nature of this ... this ... Well , I require some clarification , Doctor . As you know , I have isolated the growth hormone of the anterior pituitary , the specific substance which controls the growth pattern of human beings . Yes , it was the subject of one of your papers . Yes , and with this accomplished , I said to myself what would the effect be of this hormone , or a complete human pituitary being transferred in the body of another creature ? I began a series of experiments ... Moderate success among the lesser animals , a complete failure among birds . And then , experimenting one day upon the hexapods , I came upon the Theraphosidae family . MASTERSON : A tarantula ? Exactly . The tarantulas began to yield amazing results . They grew as large as human beings , began developing new reasoning powers . And I found I had the telepathic power to communicate with them . And then I reversed the process , transplanted the controlled substance of the insect back into the human body . Doctor , observe this girl . I call her Tarantella . She has human beauty and intelligence , but still possesses the capacities and instincts of the giant spider . How do you mean ? She has the indestructibility of the insect . If her body became damaged , if she were to lose an arm or a leg , she could grow a new one . I expect Tarantella may survive for hundreds and hundreds of years . And what about males ? Well unfortunately , in the insect world , the male is a puny , unimportant thing . You saw a few of the examples . The dwarfs . I think we 're beginning to get some results . What is it ? If we are successful , I shall have a super female spider with a thinking and reasoning brain , a creature that someday may control the world subject to my will . Are you convinced now , Doctor ? I hope you appreciate this opportunity I 'm giving you to become a colleague of mine . No ... no ! You can 't do these things ! You 're tampering with the work of the Creator ! Gibberish . You 're evil ! This place is like ... You must be destroyed , you and all the foul things that you 've made ! Your choice , Doctor . A very poor choice . Of course you know I cannot let you leave this place . Someway , somehow I 'll find a way to put an end to you and your ghastly experiments ! [ sinister music ] Regrettable . I was hoping for a colleague , but ... well at least we have another experimental subject . Mr. Masterson , here 's your orange juice . Mr. Masterson ! [ music playing ] [ music stops ] [ applause ] Thank you , sir . Thank you very much . [ music playing ] What a dump . Well , it isn 't exactly the Star Club , I 'll admit . But ... Senora , Senor ... the best people in the house . Something to drink ... Anything tall and cool . Si , senor . We had to come down in this flea-bitten border town . And you would drag me to this dive ... this upholstered sewer . Oh , I find this place rather amusing . Your great southwest has a certain , uh , flare , no ? No . I don 't happen to be in the mood for a cook 's tour of our great southwest . If it wasn 't for that forced landing , we 'd be in Mexico getting married by now . But my dear , you can 't blame me for the motor trouble . Those things will happen to the best of planes . Well it didn 't have to happen on my wedding day . Now you 're acting childish , and that 's not you . After all , being able to adapt oneself to any situation is the mark of the true sophisticate . I 'm sorry . And you 're not angry with me ? Of course not , darling . William J Masterson is the name . May I ? I beg your pardon ? May I say you are beautiful , my dear ? Very beautiful and good . That 's very kind of you . Yes , Wu ? The plane is ready , huh ? Not for some time . The pilot is having considerable trouble . Spend a small fortune for a plane , hire the best pilot I can get , and what happens ? Well , Wu ? What are you waiting for ? Get back to the plane . Yes , master . [ guitar ] [ music playing ] Masterson , it 's certainly good to see you . I 've been looking for you for two days . I 'm sorry , but I felt like a little trip . We missed you , sir . Dr. Harrison wishes to see you , you know ? [ awkward chuckle ] I know , George . But I don 't want to see him . I don 't get this . Who are you , and what 's this all about ? I 'm his nurse , miss . His nurse ? Yes . You see , Mr. Masterson is ... MASTERSON : No , George . I wouldn 't do that . See , I like this lady . You like her ? Very much . She 's fascinating ... as a dancer , of course . I don 't like her . That woman is evil . Tell me ... tell me what 's wrong . Not now , Anne . Don 't talk . And they threw her down , and blood was sprinkled on the wall . And he trod her underfoot . [ gun shot ] Give me that gun , Mr. Masterson . Please , give me that gun ! Come on , let 's get out of here . Stop , everybody ! Listen , this man 's an insane killer . He 's loco . He 'll kill all of us before you can reach him . Thank you , George . Well spoken . I only did what had to be done . George ... Don 't take another step . This lady is my friend , and nobody shall hurt her . I will kill her first . [ cacophonous music ] [ sound stops ] George ... let 's go home . Don 't be afraid . I won 't let them hurt you . Oh , you brought the cars , George . Excellent . You 'll sit with me . But Mr. Masterson , she 's not going with us . Not going with us ? You must , my dear . You 're in danger . But we 've got to get to the landing field . Landing field ? Very well , I shall take you there . Let me talk to the Sheriff . Doreen dear , you sit up here in front . Miss Doreen is going to sit with me , aren 't you ? Yes . Yes , of course . [ car starts ] There 's a dead woman lying right here on the floor . That 's right , Sheriff . He shot her dead . No , she 's right where she fell . Nobody touched a thing . We ... [ music playing ] Sheriff , the body just got up and walked out of here . Here we are , my dear . At last . And Philip seems to ready for the take-off . All set to go , Philips ? Sorry sir , but one of the engine 's still acting up . Whatever it is , I can 't find the butt . It 's probably nothing serious . Can 't we take off anyway ? No sir , I can 't take that chance . You 're the captain . How much longer do you think ... My dear young man . I want to fly . You ... you want to ... I 've always wanted to fly . And now I will . Sorry , sir . But I 'm the one who decides whether we fly or not . I command , and thou shalt obey . Is he kidding ? He ain 't kidding , mister . You 'd better do as he says . We fly ... now . You 'll go first . [ sirens ] Listen , the police ! At last ! Don 't be afraid . I won 't let them harm you . Get in , quick . Come along , George . Now we will all fly . Well , she 's on course . How long do you think it will take us , Philips ? If everything goes all right , about an hour and a half . It 's wonderful up here so close to heaven . Wait a minute , there 's something wrong with this gyrocompass . Somebody 's fooled with the setting . We 've been flying 100 degrees off course . I knew it . The left engine 's acting up already . Is it bad , Jan ? Do we have to go down again ? How should I know ? Just stay calm , please . Nothing seriously wrong so far . It 's getting worse ... much worse ' I 'll have to go down , and fast . I can 't see a place to land . It don 't look too good , Miss . We keep on flying . I like it . This is my order . Fasten your safety belts . This can 't last much longer . And please , remain calm . Can 't you find the landing spoke , Philips ? Not yet , but I am trying for that Mesa dead ahead . You think we 'll make it ? I don 't know , sir . Keep your fingers crossed . Miss Culbertson , no smoking ! OK , captain . But may I ask where we are ? Somewhere over Mexico at an altitude of 1,500 , and with a dying engine . The other one 's OK . It doesn 't do us any good , not in this ship . Birds fly without motors , and so will we . Mister , I don 't know who you or what you are , but this bird won 't fly . When a bird is sick , he has to land . And our bird is sick ... very sick . The sick I shall heal . The good I shall protect . We 've got a chance . I 'm going down . Well hold tight ! It 's going to be rough . Hold on , everybody ! It looks too short . I 'll have to break the run . Is everything all right ? Yes . Yes , I 'm all right . Good . Stick close , I want to talk to you . Right . I never thought we 'd make it , Philips . But we did , sir . Good girl , Miss Culbertson . Oh , thank you , captain . I like it here . Our voices sound strange up here . Do you hear that ? It must be the echo of our voices , my dear , thrown back at us from the forest . Two days ago he got away from us . I been hunting him ever since . I caught up with him in that border dive just before he killed that dancer . I tried , but I couldn 't stop him . Why did he kill her ? How did he get that gun ? Nobody knows why he kills . He just wants to , and he does . How he got that gun ? Probably bought it . He has lots of money all the time . Doesn 't mean a thing to him . Can 't we get that gun away from him ? I 'll try , captain . You can bet on that . But for the sake of all of us , don 't try to rush or force him . Leave it to me . All right . May I smoke now , captain ? No , not yet . I have to look at a gas tanks first . Now , Miss Culbertson , you may smoke . Thank you , captain . Any idea where we are , Philips ? I think so , sir . We 're in Mexico about 120 miles below the border on top of a mesa rising 600 feet above the desert . 600 feet ! That 's right ... stuck up in the air like a ... Like an island in the sky . I suppose we can 't walk down from here . Not unless you 're a human fly . DOREEN : I 'm sorry , captain . Haven 't been with the circus for years . It 's wonderful ! So close to heaven . I 'd better get that flare and the flash light . We 'll need some light . Something moves in there . I don 't like it here a bit . Well , if they had a nightmare , this is it . Who could be out there ? I don 't know , Culbertson . Well it could be a very natural cause ... An old dead branch breaking off , or a falling tree . I wouldn 't worry too much . Well here comes Wu . Now we will have a fire . Did you hear that noise out there , Wu ? Yes , master . You heard ? Did you see anything ? The curtain of darkness veils the sharpest eyes . Wu saw nothing . Well let 's get that fire going . I 'll be back in a minute . Well , that 's better ! We have a fire , flare and ... A drink ... oh , I certainly can use it . That 's what occurred to me when I saw the bottle . But first , let 's get this into the air . [ loud whistle ] Our only flare , and it worked . How do we know it was seen ? Well we don 't , sir . All we can do is hope . Sorry , Miss Culbertson ... no glass . Oh that 's all right , Wu . It 's a relief to be informal once in a while . I think I 'll eat something . I feel hungry . Shut up , you fool ! You are the fool , Jan ! Remember his gun ? A hungry animal knows no fear . No , thank you ... not brandy just before dinner . Sorry , sir , to disillusion you . But there 's no food on this ship , not even a K-ration . Thank you , sir . That helped . I 'm going to look around . What for ? You can 't see anything . We need this flash lighter . I have this . Does that give out enough light ? Sure , I use it at the sanitarium all the time . It 's passed my dinnertime , dear . Aren 't you hungry ? But Mr. Masterson , we have no food with us . George will bring it . He always does . If our fire wasn 't seen by anyone , how will be get off this mesa ? To be honest , sir , I don 't know . We can 't do anything decisive until daylight . [ music playing ] Thank you , captain . You 're so attentive . But even I can do some things for myself . So I noticed . And , uh , no offense meant . You scare easily , don 't you , captain ? [ scream ] It 's George ! He needs help . I 'll go see what happened . Wu 's right . He does need help . I 'm going with you , Grant . Anything 's better than to have to sit here and wait . May I suggest that we wait here until Philips find out what happened . You 'll be safer here . Are you concerned about my safety ? George is out there and in trouble . I 'll go . Anyone who wants to come along can do so now . I 'd like a stroll before dinner . Since you insist , we all go . You come too . Yes , master . I 'll have to put some more wood on the fire . Let 's stay close together . The , uh , best way is to hold each other 's hand and form a line . If you don 't mind ... I believe it 's better , Mr. van Croft , if you hold onto Mr. Masterson 's coat . And Wu , you bring up the rear . DOREEN : Can you see anything ? I can 't . [ rustling ] Is that you , George ? The is the end of the trail . Can you see anything down there ? Only a black , gaping hole . Light won 't reach bottom . Well you wait here . I 'll try this alone . It looks too narrow . One wrong step , and we may all go over . Is it George ? Yeah . Who could have shot him ? Nobody shot him . Look . Those aren 't bullet wounds ? How horrible ! What could have killed him ? I don 't know . I hope we won 't have to find out . George is beyond help . We should all go back and tend the fire for the living . Poor George . Well there 's not a thing we can do for him . Now stand close to the underbrush . I 'll have to get by . I can 't see a thing . That noise is not falling branches . Something 's moving in there ! Help , it 's got me ! Something got me ! Where ? Here on my arm ... my left arm . That 's a nasty scratch , all right , but nothing serious . I 'll dress it as soon as we get back to the plane . I 'd suggest we all stay away from these thorns . Oh look , this skirt 's ruined . And so is this heel . But you weren 't hurt , Miss Culbertson . No , not a bit . Thank you . May we go on now , Philips ? Uh , yes sir . Let 's go . Where 's that bottle of yours , captain ? I sure could use another drink . I think we all could stand a little drink after this experience . How about you ? There must be something we can do to get help . We 've done the only thing we can do ... that 's send up a flare . If help doesn 't come by morning , we 'll make a signal fire . But meanwhile , I 'd suggest we get some sleep . We got a long night ahead of us . Do you expect any of us to sleep after ... After what happened tonight ? Well , I ... maybe not sleep , but at least you 'll get some rest . But we are all in danger . Whatever killed George may attack us . Take it easy , sir . I 'll stand guard and keep the fire going ... my eyes open . Well , we all could use a little rest . But remember now , we are putting our lives in your hands . I realize that , sir . Doreen , dear , why don 't you try to make yourself a little comfortable ? Try to get some rest . I 'll try . The doctor said it was a good night to melt away with the morning sun . Mr. Masterson , don 't you think you better get some sleep ? Is it bedtime ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's bedtime . I 'll awake you when morning comes . [ rustling ] Very good , my dear ... very good . Soon their nerves will break . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to wake you . I wasn 't asleep . Are you nervous ? No . I was just thinking . Philips , why do you ignore me ? That what you were thinking about ? Yes . And I resent it . You 're not used to it , huh ? Do you really dislike me that much ? I don 't dislike you , Miss Culbertson . But you don 't approve of me , is that it ? You think I 'm marrying him for his money . Well , aren 't you ? I 'm very fond of him . But you don 't love him . Well I 'm not exactly mad about him , if that 's what you mean . But I am fond of him . And he can give you nice things . Well , yes . Why not ? He can give me security , for one thing . And that 's important . Don 't you think ? Why should you care what I think ? I don 't exactly . It 's just that I 'd like you to understand me . What is it ? I thought I heard something . No , I guess it wasn 't anything . Now , uh , what were you saying ? I was saying that I 'd like you to understand me . I think I do understand you . Oh , no you don 't . You can 't . Oh yes I can . I 've had my hard knocks , too . I 've had to work ever since I was a kid . Some of it wasn 't very much fun . Well , I guess it boils down to what you want out of life . What is it for you , Grant ? Well , I want a girl who 's sincere , real ... someone who ... Who 'd stick by me when the chips are down ... one who wants me only for what I am , and not for what I have . It 's a big order , huh ? Wait a minute ! This was to be your wedding night , remember ? Yes . Yes , of course . That was a foolish thing to do . Grant look ! Take it easy , Mrs. Culverson . Your imagination is getting the best of you . This was no imagination . It was there , I saw it ! What did you see , dear ? Well , I couldn 't sleep . Philips and I were sitting here talking , and there was a noise . I looked up , and I ... I saw some women and a little man . He seemed unreal . No offense intended , Miss Culbertson , but I know what strange tricks our minds can play on us . Yes I know , Philips . But I 'm sure I saw it . Where 's your comb , my dear ? Comb ? Oh , I guess I lost it out there somewhere . But I gave it to you . We must find it . That comb is a valuable heirloom of my family . What do you mean by we ? If you think I 'm going out there once more , you 're crazy . I didn 't intend you to go . Wu will go and look for it . May I have the light ? Oh , don 't be a fool ! He who serves well will also serve in danger . Wu ? The wanderer in the valley of darkness shall have my guidance and protection . OK , Wu . If you feel that way about , I won 't stop you . But don 't hesitate to use that gun . I hope you know how . There is a day to be born and a day to die . I want you to realize that if Wu doesn 't come back you will be responsible . I 'll never touch that comb again even if he finds it . I still have my heirloom . You make me sick ! And you are a coward , sir . What ? Why you ... You 're very brave , aren 't you , since Masterson no longer has a gun ? Let go of me if you don 't want to lose your job . I haven 't had the opportunity to tell you yet , but I quit when Wu went out there on your orders . Have you brought Masterson ? Yes , he 's here . Good , we 've found him at last . What about the others ? Well I have something in mind for the girl and the pilot . The other I 'm going to dispose of . What 's the matter , Wu ? There 's your priceless heirloom . Wu is dead ? Yeah . You murdered him ! They 're coming for us ! They 're coming ! Throw more wood on that fire , quick ! Just keep it moving , Doreen . Well , remember , we haven 't seen them yet . Aren 't you afraid , Grant ? I 'm scared stiff . If you 're frightened , what do you call him ? I can 't stand it . I 'm getting out of here . GRANT : Don 't be a fool ! The only thing keeping them back is our fire ! Oh , no ! [ scream ] Grant , look ! [ scream ] He 'll recover consciousness in a moment or so ... be perfectly sane again . Unfortunately , he left us in such a state before . I understand that he was committed to an asylum , and attempted to kill Tarantella . Grant , look ! It 's the dancer from the cafe . I saw him kill her . Amazing , the durability of my creations . Dr. Aranya ! Aranya ... that 's Spanish for spider . We meet again , doctor . Again ? Did I leave here ? Yes , I seem to remember vaguely that ... Yes , you escaped us before , doctor . And well , you led us a merry chase recovering you . Why ... why not just kill me ? Why bring me back ? Unfortunately , I still need your help . If I give you one more chance to change your mind . No , never ! Nothing you can do will ever make me a party to this . Tarantella ... No , you 're not going to torture him anymore ! Stop it ! Don 't , you fool ! Fool ? I don 't think so . In just a few moments , this will explode and destroy you , and me , and all of your terrible creations . Doctor , you 're a man of science ! You wouldn 't destroy the greatest achievement of science . Scientist , yes ... but I 'm a human being , too . And that 's where we differ . You two have got a chance . Through that door and down the corridor on the right ... hurry ! Who is he ? What is this place ? He 's a brilliant madman . Hurry , there are only seconds left ! - What about you ? - Don 't argue ... go ! No , don 't ! Take it , Aranya . Your creations can grow a new arm or a leg , but nothing can survive fire . [ explosion ] I don 't know how long we stumbled and staggered across that desert before they found us . Well , that 's about the story . Believe it or not . Grant ! How do you feel , honey ? All right , I guess . I 've just been telling them our story . They ... they don 't buy it . I think he did . Es verdad . That 's the truth . Now don 't worry about it . You 're going to be all right in a couple of days . Just a little too much sun on the bare head . Anybody thinks I 'm going to load one of my trucks with oil and send it up on top of a mountain to burn a bunch of imaginary spiders ... NARRATOR : Yes , you 're right , Dan . Common sense tells you there isn 't anything to his story , doesn 't it ? Giant spiders on a desert mesa ... fantastic ! Pepe is just a superstitious native . True , no one has ever been on Zapa Mesa . But it 's just like any other bit of table land ... Not a thing different about it . Or , uh , is there ?

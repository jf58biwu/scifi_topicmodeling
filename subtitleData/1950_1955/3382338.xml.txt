HELP ME ! I 'M ALIVE ! SOMEBODY . HELP ME , PLEASE ! Man : I 'M MICHAEL . MICHAEL ROGAN . WHAT 'S YOUR NAME ? IT IS YOU . ALL THESE WEEKS , I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK I WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT . NOW I DON 'T KNOW . WHERE ARE YOU FROM ? I WAS BORN IN RHODE ISLAND . SCHOOL - DARTMOUTH ... A MASTER OF ARTS IN ENGLISH LITERATURE . GAVE ME DICTION AND A JOB AS A BARKER ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING . EMPIRE STATE BUILDING . WE ARE NOW SITUATED ON A POINT 102 STORIES IN THE AIR ON THE HIGHEST , LOFTIEST MAN-MADE EDIFICE IN ALL THE WORLD . BOROUGH OF THE BRONX , BROOKLYN , QUEENS , STATEN ISLAND ... YEAH , THAT 'S WHERE I WAS WHEN IT ALL BEGAN . I RAN FOR THE ELEVATORS , SOMETHING HIT ME , AND I WOKE UP - IT WAS ALL OVER . I WAS THE ONLY ONE ALIVE - IN ALL NEW YORK , THE ONLY ONE ALIVE . I BEGAN TO RUN . IT WAS A NIGHTMARE . WHOLE UNITED STATES , WHEREVER THERE HAD BEEN PEOPLE , THAT INFERNAL RADIOACTIVE DUST - IT CHOKED AND IT KILLED AND IT - BUT THERE COMES AN END TO RUNNING . WHERE WERE YOU ? WHERE ... I 'M GOING HUNTING . I GO EVERY DAY . THERE 'S NOTHING TO HUNT , BUT I GO ANYWAY . I NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD - A HOUSE , FOOD , NO PROBLEMS . HAVE YOU BEEN SITTING HERE ALL DAY ? COME ON INSIDE . DO YOU WANT TO GET SICKER ? YOU SURE YOU DON 'T WANT MORE ? I WANT TO TELL YOU . I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL . THEY TOOK ME INTO THE X-RAY ROOM . ALL OF A SUDDEN , THERE - THERE WAS A STRANGE NOISE . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT . WHEN I WOKE UP , I WAS LYING ON THE BED . DRINK . I STILL DON 'T KNOW YOUR NAME . ROSEANNE . THE LEAD SHIELD AROUND THE X-RAY ROOM - THAT 'S WHAT SAVED YOU . WHY DID YOU COME HERE ? MY MOTHER 'S SISTER LIVES - LIVED HERE . SHE WAS AN ARTIST , AND I CAME HERE ONE SUMMER . I WAS SO HAPPY , I NEVER FORGOT . WHO WAS ... THE MAN IN THE PICTURE ? STEVEN . HUSBAND ? YES . DO YOU MIND IF I STAY HERE A LITTLE LONGER ? I THOUGHT MAYBE I 'D NEVER SEE ANYONE AGAIN . GOOD MORNING . I 'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO GET UP . I 'VE GOT TO GO GET FOOD . THERE 'S A COUNTRY STORE DOWN THE ROAD . IT 'S ABOUT A MILE , SO I 'LL BE GONE FOR A WHILE . NO , TAKE ME WITH YOU . ALL RIGHT . PEOPLE - WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE ? THERE SHOULD BE PEOPLE ! STOP THINKING ABOUT IT ! STOP THINKING ABOUT IT . DO YOU HEAR ME ? STOP IT . NEW YORK , CLEVELAND , CHICAGO - WHAT I SAW THERE WAS ENOUGH TO CRACK MY HEAD OPEN , BUT I STOPPED THINKING ABOUT IT . I 'D LOOK AT IT AND I WOULDN 'T SEE IT . THAT 'S THE ONLY WAY OF THE WORLD THAT NEVER WAS . NOT EVEN A MOUSE . THESE COUNTRY STORES - YOU GOT ANYTHING . TAKE WHAT YOU WANT . REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT BOX TOPS USED TO BE ? MY MA - THAT WAS HER BIG DREAM . TEAR OFF A BOX TOP , WRITE 20 WITTY WORDS , AND OWN THE WORLD . MAIL IT IN WITH 10 CENTS IN STAMPS AND YOU 'LL GET RICH , FAT , AND FAMOUS . HERE , MADAM , TEAR OFF A BOX TOP . COME ON . LET 'S GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET OUT OF HERE . IT 'S GETTING COLD OUT . I GOT ENOUGH FOR ALL NIGHT . ALL THOSE YEARS IN NEW YORK AND I NEVER SAW THE MOONLIGHT . I HATED NEW YORK . IT WAS LIKE A TRAP HOLDING ME . WHEN I WAS A KID , WE WERE SO POOR - HUNGRY POOR . UP IN THE COUNTRY , HUNGER IS DIFFERENT . IN THE CITY , EVERYTHING THERE , ONLY A PIECE OF GLASS BETWEEN YOU AND WHAT YOU NEED . IT 'S DONE WITH . ROSEANNE ... WHAT ABOUT US ? NO , NO ! UHH ! YOU LITTLE FOOL , THERE 'S ONLY US . STEVEN ! HE 'S DEAD . I 'M HERE . AAH ! STEVEN , SAVE ME ! OH ! SAVE ME ! I 'M ALMOST OUT OF EVERYTHING . GET YOU SOME STUFF TOMORROW . TAKE ME WITH YOU . LET 'S GO TO THE CITY . MAYBE STEVEN 'S ALIVE . I DON 'T KNOW , BUT I 'VE GOT TO KNOW . PRETTY SOON I WON 'T BE ABLE TO WALK SO FAR , BUT I 'M ALL RIGHT NOW . PLEASE LET 'S GO THERE TOMORROW . WHY DON 'T YOU ANSWER ME ? DO YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF AND IT ? THROUGH SOME MIRACLE , WE 'RE SAFE HERE , BUT IN THE CITY , HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND - BUT I 'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT STEVEN ! ALL RIGHT , I 'LL TELL YOU . HE 'S DEAD . THEY 'RE ALL DEAD - EVERYONE . YOU AND I ARE IN A DEAD WORLD , AND I 'M GLAD IT 'S DEAD - CHEAP HONKY-TONK OF A WORLD . WAIT ! STOP ! HEY ! I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE ANYONE . BOY , NEITHER DID I. OH , A YOUNG LADY . I AM OLIVER P. BARNSTAPLE . I AM ASSISTANT CASHIER AT THE SANTA BARBARA BANK . HOW DO YOU DO ? A MIRACLE - WHEN WE SAW THAT SMOKE IN THE SKY FROM YOUR CHIMNEY . ANOTHER HOUR , AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DARK . WAS IT PRETTY ROUGH ? FIRE FEELS GOOD . YES , IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH . FIRST GETTING LOCKED IN THE VAULT . THE AIR GOT PRETTY BAD . HE 'S A PRETTY OLD MAN . THEN WHEN I FOUND THE INSIDE RELEASE FOR THE TIME LOCK MECHANISM , WHEN WE GOT OUT , THEN WE FOUND EVERYBODY , EVERYBODY HE 'D WORKED WITH ALL THOSE YEARS . IT WASN 'T EASY ON HIM , EITHER . USED TO DRIVE ONE IN THE ARMY - AND WE JUST WENT OFF , WENT AROUND IN CIRCLES , I GUESS . I WASN 'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU 'D CALL NORMAL , EITHER , FOR A WHILE . I 'D ALWAYS SEEN THE DEAD IN THEIR COFFINS . ANYONE WANT SOME MORE ? I AM MOST CONTENT . I 'M FULL UP . AH . DELICIOUS AND DELIGHTFUL , BUT TOMORROW WE MUST BE ON OUR WAY , EH , CHARLES ? OH , YES , INDEED , VACATIONS ARE DELIGHTFUL , BUT ONE HAS OBLIGATIONS TO ONE 'S WORK . SIRIUS . JUPITER . I ONCE BOUGHT A BOOK ON THE CONSTELLATIONS . IMPRACTICAL INVESTMENT . I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT . WE 'RE QUITE AN INSTITUTION , YOU KNOW . THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION CAPITALIZATION . DO YOU MIND IF I STROLL OUT ON THE POINT AND LOOK AT THE GLORIES OF NATURE ? ONE MUST ENJOY ONE 'S VACATION WHILE ONE CAN , YOU KNOW . OF COURSE . BE CAREFUL , SIR . OOH , I 'LL BE QUITE ALL RIGHT . I ... WANT TO SAY SOMETHING . WHAT I SAID BEFORE , I DON 'T KNOW IF IT 'S TRUE ANYMORE . WE 'RE ALIVE AND NOW THOSE TWO . I DON 'T KNOW . Michael : I 'VE GOT A PLACE FIXED UP DOWN THERE . I THINK PERHAPS MR. BARNSTAPLE HAD BETTER STAY HERE TONIGHT . OH , NO , MY DEAR YOUNG LADY . NO , INDEED . FOR 40 YEARS I HAVE WANTED TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS . I NEVER DID , YOU KNOW . IT GETS QUITE COLD HERE . IT 'S ALL RIGHT . THERE 'S A COUCH . COME ALONG . I AM TIRED . IT WON 'T EMBARRASS YOU ? NO . ON THE WAY , DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ALIVE ? JUST A FEW BIRDS . HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT BANK STATEMENTS . YES , MA 'AM . BEFORE HE GOT SICK , HE WAS A PRETTY BRIGHT MAN IN HIS CAGE , MR. BARNSTAPLE WAS , BUT WHEN HE GOT OUT , FOUND ALL THE PEOPLE HE 'D BEEN WORKING WITH JUST LYING THERE , WELL , YOU MIGHT SAY HE WAS SORT OF LIKE A MACHINE WITH NO ONE LEFT TO PRESS THE BUTTONS . WE 'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM . YES , MA 'AM . CHARLES ? YES , MA 'AM ? DID YOU HAVE A FAMILY ? YES , MA 'AM . EXCELLENT INVESTMENT , A HOUSE . WHAT 'S YOUR HUSBAND 'S BUSINESS ? HE 'S AN ARCHITECT . OH , EXCELLENT . EXCELLENT . WE DO A GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS WITH ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS . OUR ESCROW DEPARTMENT IS MOST EFFICIENT . DID I FALL DOWN ? I DON 'T REMEMBER . OH , I MUST HAVE BRUISED MYSELF . I SEEM TO BE BLEEDING UNDER MY SKIN MANY PLACES . I THINK IT 'S RADIATION POISONING . HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . I 'M GUESSING . BUT AFTER HIROSHIMA , THE MAGAZINES RAN PICTURES . IT LOOKS THE SAME . BUT YOU 'RE NOT SURE . NO , I 'M NOT SURE . GOOD MORNING . HOW 'S THE LAUNDRY BUSINESS ? I CAN 'T TURN OFF THE FAUCET . HOW IS HE ? SLEEPING . THREE DAYS , SLEEPING . Michael : CHARLES , CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND ? OKAY ! MADAM , I HEREBY TENDER MY RESIGNATION . I AM ENTERING THE BROADER FIELD OF THE BUILDING TRADE . Oliver : MISS ? MISS ROSEANNE ? WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS WOOD ? FORESTRY STATION TWO VALLEYS OVER . HEY , THERE 'S AN ELECTRIC GENERATOR OVER THERE . IS THAT A FACT ? YEAH . ELECTRIC LIGHT . NOW , THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING . AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD FIND ME A WASHING MACHINE . THEN I COULD FIX ME UP A METER , SEND ME A BILL EVERY MONTH . COURSE , I WOULDN 'T PAY IT , SO THAT WOULD FORCE ME TO DISCONNECT MYSELF . DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK - A WORLD WITHOUT ANY BILLS . Roseanne : CHARLES ? CHARLES ! HI . MICHAEL , CHARLES ... WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? HE 'S AWAKE , AND HE WANTS TO GO DOWN TO THE OCEAN . OCEAN ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? HE SEEMS PERFECTLY RATIONAL , BUT HE SAYS HE WANTS TO GO DOWN TO THE OCEAN RIGHT AWAY . OH , YES . I THINK HE 'S BETTER . YES . HOW ABOUT YOU ? I 'M FINE . I 'VE NEVER ASKED YOU BEFORE , BUT I 'VE GOT TO , SO HERE GOES . WHEN DOES ... I 'M NOT SURE . THREE MONTHS , MAYBE . DID I EVER TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN , I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO SEA ? I DON 'T REMEMBER WHY I DIDN 'T . HE 'LL BE ALL RIGHT . CONEY ISLAND . WHAT DID YOU SAY ? I WAS THINKING OF CONEY ISLAND ON A DAY LIKE THIS . DO YOU KNOW CONEY ISLAND ? THERE WAS PEOPLE , HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM JAMMED TOGETHER , BODY TO BODY ... TRYING TO GET A LITTLE SUMMER , A LITTLE FRESH AIR , AND I WITH THEM . I STILL SEE A - WHAT 'S THE MATTER WITH ME ? MICHAEL . MICHAEL ! CHARLES ! CHARLES ! LAST DRIFTWOOD ON THE BEACH . HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW , MISTER ? THE LAST SURVIVORS . I HAVE LISTENED TO THESE STORIES OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL MIRACLES . NOW I 'LL TELL YOU OF MINE . I WAS ON THE MOUNTAIN WHEN IT HAPPENED . THE MOUNTAIN . EVEREST . SURELY YOU HEARD OF OUR EXPLORATION . NO MATTER . I ALONE . THERE WAS A GREAT BLIZZARD . FOR FIVE DAYS I WAS MAROONED ON THE FINAL RIDGE . WHEN I RETURNED TO THE BASE CAMP 5,000 FEET BELOW , THEY WERE ALL DEAD . I MADE MY WAY ACROSS ASIA TO THE COAST . AGAIN I WAS THE ONLY LIVING THING . I FOUND A BOAT . I WENT TO HAWAII . AGAIN A MOUNTAIN OF DEAD . I FOUND A PLANE . I DECIDED TO TRY AMERICA . I RAN OUT OF PETROL A FEW HOURS AGO . I CLIMBED MT . EVEREST . I ALONE . ALWAYS ALONE . NOW THERE ARE YOU . WE ARE QUITE THE COMMUNITY . Charles : MIKE , ROSEANNE , COME HERE . WHAT WENT WRONG ? HE JUST ... DIED . I 'LL STAY . YOU COME BACK FOR US . NO , I 'LL BURY HIM HERE . YOU TAKE ROSEANNE HOME . NO , I 'LL STAY . DON 'T YOU THINK YOU 'D BETTER COME ALONG ? NO . CHARLES , IT 'S ALL RIGHT . HE LOVED THE SEA . SHE SHOULDN 'T BE CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THAT HILL . SHE WANTS TO FEED THE MAN . HE 'S NOT THAT SICK . WHAT 'S GONNA BE WITH ROSEANNE WHEN HER TIME COMES ? I DON 'T KNOW . IF MY OLD FATHER COULD SEE ME NOW . WHY ? HE USED TO WAVE THE BIBLE AT ME AND SAY , " IN THE SWEAT OF THY FACE SHALL THOU EAT BREAD . " HOW ABOUT THE BANK ? NO SWEAT OF YOUR FACE ? GOOD MORNING , MR. HARRISON . GOOD MORNING , MR. ADAMS . GOOD MORNING , MR. PALMER . WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO , CHARLES ? I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER . WHY DIDN 'T YOU ? LOST MY WAY SOMEWHERE , I GUESS . FIRST A GIRL , A DECENT SUIT , THEN AFTER A WHILE I GUESS WHAT I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS A LITTLE PIECE OF SECURITY , 9 : 30 TO 4 : 00 , $ 38.50 A WEEK , EVERY WEEK . SECURITY . WELL , HOW IS THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT GOING ? WE DON 'T KNOW IF THE SEED WILL GROW . WHY NOT ? THINGS ARE SO STRANGE - NO BIRDS , NO ANIMALS , SO MANY THINGS I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? FINE . I THINK I 'D BETTER SEE HOW THE FARMERS ARE DOING . ISN 'T THAT A MISDIRECTION OF ENERGY ? WHY THIS RETURN TO PRIMITIVENESS ? THE SHELVES OF THE CITIES ARE BURSTING WITH FOOD , A LIFETIME OF FOOD . MICHAEL DOESN 'T WANT TO GO NEAR THE CITIES . DO YOU WANT TO STAY HERE ? I HAVE TO NOW . I MEAN AFTER YOUR CHILD IS BORN . I THINK I WILL TRY TO GET UP TOMORROW . OH , THAT 'S WONDERFUL , ERIC . YOU 'RE VERY SWEET . EVERYBODY COME ON ! HURRY . COME ON ! TAKE IT EASY . WHAT COULD IT BE ? IT 'S GROWING AT LAST . SO ? PRETTY GOOD FOR CITY FOLKS , HUH ? CORN ON THE COB . I WAS A FOOL . A LONG , TERRIBLE TRIP TO REACH HERE , ENDLESS DAYS AT SEA , ALONE , ALWAYS ALONE . NOW I HAVE FOUND MY CIVILIZATION . AS LONG AS THINGS KEEP GROWING , EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT . YES , I KNOW . NATURE SO ARRANGES IT THAT WHEN A WOMAN IS IN YOUR CONDITION , CLOUDS ARE LIKE RAINBOWS AND ALL THE WORLD IS LIKE A CRADLE . HEY , THEY 'RE ON ! THEY 'RE ON ! HOW WONDERFUL ... MUSIC . I 'VE WANTED IT SO MUCH . WE FOUND 100 RECORDS . I WISH I COULD DANCE . ME . YOU SIT . I 'LL DO IT FOR YOU . IT 'LL KEEP BURNING . THERE 'S PLENTY OF GAS IN THE GENERATOR . I KEEP THINKING HOW I NEVER SAW THE LIGHTS . ALL MY LIFE IN THE CITY , AND I NEVER SAW THEM . Michael : VERY NICE . Charles : AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE SEWING BOOTIES . IT IS VERY NICE . THANK YOU . YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH WORK FOR ONE DAY . COME OUTSIDE AND TALK TO ME . I 'D LIKE TO FINISH THIS SEWING . THAT CORN OUT OF THE CAN WAS MIGHTY TASTY TONIGHT . THE BLESSING OF OUR AGE - THE AMERICAN CANNING INDUSTRY , AND YET IT DEBASED YOUR TASTE DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF BAKED BEANS AND HASH . I DIDN 'T NOTICE ANY LEFTOVER BEANS ON YOUR PLATE TONIGHT . WHEN IN ROME , EAT SWILL LIKE THE ROMANS . I 'D LIKE TO GO PLACES TONIGHT AND HAVE A BIG TIME - ORDER A DOUBLE-DECKER HAMBURGER WITH ONIONS AND A SIDE ORDER OF FRENCH FRIES AND A DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MALT . SPARE RIBS ... BARBECUED SPARE RIBS - I CAN SMELL THEM . I LIKE STRAWBERRIES , STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM . WHERE I LIVED , THE SMELL OF TRAFFIC - FROM MORNING TO NIGHT , YOU COULD SMELL THE TRAFFIC . TELEPHONE - I COULD HEAR A TELEPHONE RINGING . A NEW YORK COP , EVEN A NEW YORK COP BAWLING OUT A HACK DRIVER . WHERE I LIVED , THE FAUCET WAS ALWAYS DRIPPING . IF I COULD JUST HEAR THAT DRIPPING ... OF ALL THOSE THINGS , WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE THE MOST ? I DON 'T KNOW . KIDS RAISING THE DEVIL AROUND THE SUPPER TABLE . I HARDLY THINK THIS IS THE TIME FOR NOSTALGIC SENTIMENTALITY . I 'VE BEEN GIVING A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT TO WHY WE ARE ALIVE . OF COURSE , THERE 'S A DEFINITE PRIMARY REASON WHY HE AND YOU AND I ESCAPED THE RADIATION . I WAS AT A TREMENDOUS HEIGHT AND YOU TWO BEHIND METAL - THE BANK VAULT , THE X-RAY ROOM . AND YET WHAT ABOUT YOU ? YOU HAD NO SUCH PROTECTION . AND WHAT ABOUT THE OLD MAN WHO DIED IN SPITE OF HAVING THE SAME PROTECTION AS THIS ONE HAD ? THE ANSWER TO ME IS OBVIOUS - IMMUNITY , SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING WITHIN OUR BODIES , A CHEMISTRY WHICH GIVES US SPECIAL IMMUNITY TO THAT WHICH KILLED THE OTHERS . I SEE THE DOUBTFUL LOOK ON YOUR FACES . THEN MARK THIS . DURING THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN THE BLACK PLAGUE SWEPT ALL EUROPE , WHEN MEN DIED BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS , WHY DIDN 'T ALL MANKIND DIE ? THE DEADLY ORGANISMS WERE THERE . THERE WAS NO PROTECTION AGAINST THEM , AND YET A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVED ON AS WE HAVE LIVED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD OF MEN DROPPING DEAD AROUND THEM . THE ANSWER THEN IS IMMUNITY TO THE ORGANISMS , AND THE ANSWER HERE TODAY IS IMMUNITY AGAINST THE RADIATIONS . IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE , THEN THERE ARE OTHERS . OF COURSE . THROUGHOUT THE WORLD , THERE WOULD BE OTHERS WHO 'D HAVE OUR SORT OF IMMUNITY . NOT MANY , ONLY A FEW PERHAPS , BUT VERY DEFINITELY EXISTING AS WE ARE HERE . SOME WILL DIE FROM THE LINGERING RADIATIONS , BUT A SMALL NUMBER WILL LIVE AS WE HAVE LIVED . THAT GIVES YOU HOPE , DOESN 'T IT ? YES . LOOK , THAT 'S JUST A THEORY , AND A THEORY 'S JUST A BUNCH OF WORDS SET FRONT TO BACK . BUT A THEORY BECOMES A FACT WITH PROOF , AND THAT IS THE VERY REASON WE SHOULD GO INTO THE CITIES AND LOOK FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ALIVE . WE WILL NEVER KNOW WAITING HERE . SHE WILL NEVER KNOW IF HER HUSBAND IS DEAD OR ALIVE . TOMORROW WOULD BE A GOOD DAY TO START , DON 'T YOU AGREE ? SHE 'S NOT WELL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL . ANYWAY , WE 'RE SAFE HERE . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US IN THE CITIES . MICHAEL , I WAS THINKING , WITH YOUR PRIMITIVE MIND AND TIMIDITY , IN A FEW YEARS YOU 'LL BE SWINGING FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES . FORTUNATELY , I - AND I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR ROSEANNE AS WELL - I 'M NOT QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS RETURN TO NATURE OF YOURS , NOT WHEN THE CITIES ARE OPEN , WAITING TREASURE CHESTS . EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD IS THERE FOR US , EVERYTHING FOR THE TAKING . AND BEYOND THAT , WHAT OF THE OTHERS WHO ARE ALIVE ? I WANT TO GET THEM TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE . WHY , SO THEY CAN BEAT THEIR HEADS ON THE GROUND FOR KING ERIC I , THE MAN WHO CLIMBED MOUNT EVEREST ? MICHAEL , I DO WANT TO GO TO THE CITY . IF WE DRIVE CAREFULLY , I 'LL BE ALL RIGHT . BUT YOU WON 'T BE ALL RIGHT . DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? IT 'S THE CITIES THEMSELVES , WHERE THE BOMBS FELL , THE RADIATIONS ARE THICKEST . HE TALKS ABOUT IMMUNITY . HAVE YOU GOT IMMUNITY TO DEAD PILED UP LIKE CORDWOOD WITH THE FLESH OFF THEIR BONES ? I WANT TO KNOW WHAT 'S HAPPENED OUT THERE , TOO , BUT MIKE 'S RIGHT . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE . WE KNOW WE 'RE ALL RIGHT HERE . WHO IN GOD 'S NAME ASKED YOU YOUR OPINION ? BUT I 'M TALKING TO HER . AND I 'M TELLING YOU TO SHUT UP . I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS INTERFERENCE . WHERE HAVE I INTERFERED WITH YOU ? THAT IS THE QUESTION . YOUR VERY PRESENCE IS DISTASTEFUL TO ME - THAT I MUST EAT WITH YOU , SLEEP UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH YOU . NOW IT 'S OUT . NO , IN THIS WORLD , YOU MUST FACE REALITY . IT IS A MISTAKE HE IS ALIVE . ALL RIGHT , LET HIM GO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE - NOT WITH YOU , NOT WITH ME . DO YOU HEAR ME ? I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE NOW ! DON 'T , ERIC ! AAH ! IT 'S LIKE IT NEVER WAS BEFORE . AND GOD STEPPED OUT ON SPACE , AND HE LOOKED AROUND AND SAID , " I 'M LONELY . I 'LL MAKE ME A WORLD . " AND GOD SMILED , AND THE LIGHT BROKE AND THE DARKNESS ROLLED UP ON ONE SIDE , AND THE LIGHT STOOD SHINING ON THE OTHER . AND GOD SAID , " THAT 'S GOOD . " THEN GOD REACHED OUT AND TOOK THE LIGHT IN HIS HANDS , AND GOD ROLLED THE LIGHT AROUND IN HIS HANDS UNTIL HE 'D MADE THE SUN , AND HE SET THAT SUN ABLAZING IN THE HEAVENS , AND THE LIGHT THAT WAS LEFT FROM MAKING THE SUN , GOD GATHERED IT IN A SHINING BALL AND FLUNG IT AGAINST THE DARKNESS , SPANGLING THE NIGHT WITH THE MOON AND THE STARS , THEN DOWN BETWEEN THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT , HE HURLED THE WORLD , AND GOD SAID , " THAT 'S GOOD . " THEN THE GREEN GRASS SPROUTED , AND THE PINE TREE POINTED HIS FINGER TO THE SKY . THE LAKES CUDDLED DOWN TO THE HOLLOWS OF THE GROUND , AND THE RIVERS RAN DOWN TO THE SEA . THEN UP FROM THE BED OF THE RIVER GOD SCOOPED THE CLAY , AND BY THE BANK OF THE RIVER , HE KNEELED HIM DOWN , AND THERE THE GREAT GOD ALMIGHTY , WHO LIT THE SUN AND FIXED IT IN THE SKY , WHO FLUNG THE STARS TO THE MOST FAR CORNER OF THE NIGHT , WHO ROUNDED THE EARTH IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HAND - THIS GREAT GOD , LIKE A MOTHER BENDING OVER HER BABY , KNEELED DOWN IN THE DUST , TOILING OVER A LUMP OF CLAY TILL HE HAD SHAPED IT IN HIS OWN IMAGE . THEN INTO IT HE BLEW THE BREATH OF LIFE , AND MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL . AMEN . Michael : HERE HE IS . HE . THANK YOU , MICHAEL . I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD BE IN BED . LISTEN , MISTER , WHO 'S THE DOCTOR ON THIS CASE ? THAT 'S RIGHT . DON 'T ARGUE WITH A SPECIALIST . MICHAEL , IS THAT THE BABY ? I 'LL GO SEE . HE WAS SNORING . HE WAS NOT . IT 'S ALL RIGHT . I TOLD HIM TO TURN OVER . ROSEANNE ... WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE HIM A NAME ? SOON , I HOPE . WHY NOT NOW ? THIS IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY . YOU CAN 'T KEEP ON CALLING HIM BABY . HOW ABOUT GUTHRIE , OR GLENN , OR LEROY ? YEAH , OR RALPH , OR SYLVESTER , OR NATHANIEL , OR GUSTAV - NO . I DON 'T WANT TO NAME HIM NOW . I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL I FOUND OUT AB - ABOUT HIS FATHER . DOES YOUR SHOULDER STILL HURT ? NO , IT 'S DOING FINE . WHERE 'S ERIC ? HE TOOK THE JEEP EARLY THIS MORNING , WENT OFF SOMEWHERE . I THINK WE BETTER TALK ABOUT HIM NOW . HE SEEMS TO THINK THE FACT HE 'S SORRY SETTLES EVERYTHING . AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , NOTHING 'S SETTLED . MAYBE THE ANSWER IS FOR ME TO GO AWAY . LOOK , WE 'VE GOT TOO LITTLE A WORLD LEFT TO RUN AWAY . WE 'RE HERE , ALL OF US . ERIC 'S GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL AND RIGHT AWAY . AND WHAT IF HE DOESN 'T ? THEN HE 'S GOT TO GET OUT . DON 'T YOU AGREE ? I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T THINK IT 'S RIGHT . YOU SAID THERE CAN 'T BE ANY MORE RUNNING AWAY , AND YOU 'RE RIGHT . AT THE SAME TIME , HAVE WE THE RIGHT TO SEND ANYONE AWAY ? ANYWAY , THE WAY I 'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT , IT ISN 'T ME OR YOU HE HATES . HE 'S RIGHT , MICHAEL . WELL , THIS IS AN OCCASION . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? ALL RIGHT . I BROUGHT YOU A FEW THINGS . THANK YOU . I FOUND A PLACE OVER THE RIDGE . SOME WEALTHY MAN BUILT HIMSELF QUITE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE . MANY THINGS THERE WE COULD USE . WE 'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU . OH , IS THAT A FACT ? I THINK I 'LL GO IN . THANK YOU , CHARLES . THANK YOU FOR THE THINGS . NOT AT ALL . IT 'S VERY NICE TO SEE YOU UP AND ABOUT . THANK YOU . I 'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU . YES ? I SAID WE 'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU . YOU 'RE REPETITIOUS . LISTEN , ERIC , MAYBE WE 'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT ON EARTH , AND , WELL , MAYBE IT 'S TRUE THERE ARE OTHERS LEFT BESIDES US . EITHER WAY , IT 'S LIKE THE WORLD WAS STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN . WE 'VE GOT A NEW CHANCE TO MAKE THE WORLD WHAT - WHAT EVERYBODY USED TO TALK ABOUT . WE 'VE GOT THAT CHANCE . LET 'S MAKE THE MOST OF IT . LET 'S NOT MAKE THE MISTAKES THEY DID - THE MILLIONS OF THEM . LET 'S NOT BE AT EACH OTHER 'S THROATS . LET 'S WORK TOGETHER , LIVE TOGETHER ... LIKE FRIENDS . MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE ? LOOK , MICHAEL ... WE 'VE ALL BEEN LIVING UNDER A GREAT STATE OF TENSION . THAT IS MY ONLY EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED , BUT I THINK IT IS A VALID ONE . THE TENSIONS ARE OVER . WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ? I 'VE GOT TO FIX THE ROOF TOMORROW . WILL YOU GIVE ME A HAND ? OF COURSE . DO YOU NEED HELP UNLOADING THE JEEP ? YES . I 'LL GIVE YOU A HAND . THANK YOU . I 'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT . THAT CRAZY IDIOT . WHY DOES HE DO IT ? SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE . LET 'S SIT IN THE SHADE . HOW ABOUT YOU ? AREN 'T YOU HAPPY HERE ? YES . WE COULD BE HAPPY NOW . I HAD SO MANY THINGS TO SAY TO YOU , I - I LOST THEM ALL . ROSEANNE , LISTEN ... I 'M JUST AN ORDINARY GUY WHO HAPPENS TO BE HERE . I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE , AND ... IT DIDN 'T MATTER MUCH . PEOPLE HADN 'T MEANT MUCH TO ME . WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE ... WELL , YOU WERE JUST A WOMAN ... BUT NOW YOU 'RE ROSEANNE . I THINK OF YOU WHEN I WORK , WHEN I PLAN - SO MUCH I ... WANT TO DO . OH , MICHAEL . FILTHY SCAVENGERS . I SAW THEM IN THE CITY . IT 'S GETTING LATE . IT 'S CHARLES . WHAT 'S HE DOING DOWN HERE ? THE BABY ! CHARLES , IS THE BABY ALL RIGHT ? IS THE BABY ALL RIGHT ? SURE - SLEEPING . ERIC ? I SAW HIM FROM THE TERRACE . YOUR DEPUTY DROVE THE JEEP THROUGH IT . IS HE ALL RIGHT ? YES . HOW TERRIBLE . HOW DID - ANIMAL . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT KIND . WHY DID YOU DO IT ? WHY DID I DO WHAT ? CHARLES WORKED LIKE A DOG TO MAKE IT GROW . WHY DID YOU DO IT ? ALL THE FOOD WE COULD POSSIBLY WANT IS IN 1,000 WAREHOUSES . IF THE MAN PERSISTS IN WORKING LIKE AN ANIMAL , LET HIM WORK . I WAS TIRED . I TOOK THE SHORT ROUTE BACK . GET OUT . GET OUT NOW . I 'LL GO ... IN MY OWN TIME . IT SURE IS HOT TONIGHT . SURE WISH WE COULD FIND US AN ELECTRIC DISHWASHER . WE 'RE GOING TO GET DISHPAN HANDS . I TOLD HIM TO GET OUT . WHAT DID HE SAY ? HE SHOWED ME A GUN AND SAID HE 'D LEAVE IN HIS OWN TIME . HE 'S SLEEPING . DID YOU FINISH THE DISHES ? ALL STARCHED AND IRONED . Roseanne : WHY DIDN 'T ERIC COME UP FOR DINNER TONIGHT ? GUESS HE WENT OFF SOMEWHERE . WELL , HE 'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HE MISSED . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? WAS THERE GROUND GLASS IN THE SOUP ? NO . THAT WAS A MIGHTY FINE DINNER . I 'M JUST SO FULL , I HAVEN 'T GOT ANY ROOM FOR CONVERSATION . GOOD NIGHT , EVERYBODY . GOOD NIGHT , CHARLES . WHAT 'S THE MATTER , MICHAEL ? I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING . WHAT YOU SAID TODAY MADE ME VERY HAPPY , LIKE I USED TO BE . I FORGOT EVERYTHING EXCEPT BEING ALIVE ... BEING WITH YOU . OH , STEVEN . YES ? IT 'S ERIC . I 'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT AWAY . I 'M VERY TIRED , ERIC . I 'M GOING AWAY TONIGHT . TONIGHT ? YES . I 'VE GOT TO FIND OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL ABOUT THOSE OTHER PEOPLE . I OWE IT TO THEM , I OWE IT TO MYSELF . WILL YOU BE BACK ? YES , OF COURSE , IN A FEW DAYS . AND THEN I 'LL KNOW ONCE AND FOR ALL WHERE WE STAND . YOUR HUSBAND - IF I FIND HIM , I 'LL BRING HIM BACK WITH ME . WE 'RE A GROUP OF LIVING MIRACLES . WHY NOT HE ? YES . WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT ? I DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE . I 'LL GO WITH YOU . I HAVE THE JEEP PARKED AT THE BEND OF THE ROAD . SHOULDN 'T WE TELL ? NO . DEFINITELY NO . MICHAEL - WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WILL DO OR SAY ? NOW WE CAN GO WITHOUT ANY QUARRELING , COME BACK , AND THERE 'LL BE NO TROUBLE AT ALL . WELL , OF COURSE YOU WILL TAKE THE CHILD . COME .

Additional : Supplies are plentiful . We have enough food and drink to last 30,000 years , although we have run out of Shake ' n ' Vac . Additional additional . Last week , we found a planet with a breathable atmosphere . ( HEAVY ROCK MUSIC ) We 're grooving tonight . Ahead , groove factor five . Yeahl Hang on , everybody . Hang on ! ( MUSIC STOPS ) The sausages are done . It 's the business . It 's nice to get out , stretch your cables . ( SLURRING ) I don 't understand . I 've had so much to drink and it hasn 't even afflicted me . - Why are you dancing , then ? - You call that dancing ? I 've seen people on fire move better ! - We 'd better go . The moons are setting . - OK , then , a toast . Gentlemen , and skutters , we are gathered here today to celebrate the anniversary of Arnold Rimmer 's death . ( BURPS ) Right on , baby ! And for this very special occasion , I have baked a cake . - What 's that ? - It 's shaped like a spanner . - He was a technician . - That 's very apt . If he 'd been a postman , it 'd be an envelope , I suppose ? Gordon Bennetl It 's lucky he 's not a gynecologist . To me ! ( ALL ) Happy deathday to you Happy deathday to you Happy deathday , dear Rimmer Happy deathday to you ( BANGING AND SCRAPING ) Sow me the way to go home I 'm tired and I want to go to bed ... ( RIMMER ) Are you all right to drive ? ( LISTER ) Yeah . I had a little drink about an hour ago To celebrate Rimmer 's death What time is it ? - Saturday . - Is that the best you can do ? There are some numbers , but they could be anything . Do you know what I fancy ? A big fat woman with thighs the size of a hippo 's . No , I want a triple fried egg butty with chili sauce and chutney . Me , too . No problem . Nothing 's too good for the deathday boy . - Correct . - Hol ? Hol ? - Hol , give us something to eat . - You what ? I 'm jiggered , man . - You don 't sleep . - ' Course I do . I 've got to offline . I can 't keep up my red-hot pace all the time . I 've got to take a breather . - I want a triple fried egg sandwich ... - With chili sauce and chutney . - You what ? - It 's state of the art . It 's the state of the floor I 'm worried about . All right . OK . Trust me . I feel like I 'm having a baby ! - It 's good , innit ? - It 's incredible . - Where did you find the recipe ? - I can 't remember . I think it was a book on bacteriological warfare . It 's like a cross between food and bowel surgery . It 's well naughty . Eat it before the bread dissolves . I could never invent a sandwich like this , Lister . You see , all the ingredients are wrong . The fried eggs , wrong . The chutney , wrong . The chili sauce , all wrong . But put them together and somehow it works . It becomes right . It 's you . This sandwich , Lister , is you . - What are you saying , Rimmer ? - You 're wrong , right ? All your ingredients are wrong . You 're slobby . You 've got no sense of discipline . You 're the only man to get his money back from the Odor Eater people . But people like you . Don 't you see ? That 's why you 're a fried egg , chili , chutney sandwich . Now me , all the ingredients are right . I 'm disciplined . I 'm organized . I 'm dedicated to my career . I 've always got a pen . Result ? Total smeghead despised by everyone except the ship 's parrot ... and that 's only because we haven 't got one . - Why ? Why is that ? - It 's because you are a total smeghead . But I 'm not . I 'm a goodie . You 've never got time for people . You 're too busy trying to be successful . It 's all midnight revision and " Up , up , up , lickety-split " . All the time I spent licking up to Todhunter , even though he 's a total gimp ? Captain Hollister ? Mr Fat Bastard 2044 . I went out of my way to simp around him . That 's not having time for people . Do you know how many times I made love ? - No . I don 't want to know . - I want to tell you . - I don 't want to know ! - I 'm going to tell you ! You 'll wake up in the morning with your hangover , feeling like death , you 'll walk up to the mirror and remember and go ... " Arghh ! " It 's not worth it . Believe me , you don 't want to tell me . - Once . - Smeg ! One time only . You 'll want to kill yourself in the morning . Yvonne McGruder . A single brief liaison with the ship 's female boxing champion . March 16th . 7.31 pm to 7.43 pm . - Please ... - Twelve minutes ... including the time it took to eat the pizza . Please , Rimmer ! In my entire life , I 've spent more time being sick . So ? You haven 't met the right girl yet . No , I haven 't , Lister , and some just might say - given the fact that the human race no longer exists , coupled with the fact that I have passed on - that I 'm leaving it a little bit on the late side . Well , you made a decision . You chose career over personal life . Yes , I did . Pearls of wisdom from Mr Fried Egg Chili Chutney Sandwich Face ! Well , I 'll tell you something , Lister . I 'll tell you something . I 'd trade it all in - my pips , my long service medals , my swimming certificates , my telescope , my shoe-trees . I 'd trade everything in to be loved and to have been loved . I 'm a little lamb lost in the wood Maybe I could really be good With someone to watch over me ... That was going to be our song , but I never found anyone to share it with , so now it 's just my song . Another bit of sky . That 's a star . ( RIMMER WHINES ) ( HUMS REVEILLE ) Ah , my foot ! I must have slept on it . You were putting it away last night . You really fell for my joke . ( GROANS ) God , it 's agony ! That McGruder gag . Fancy falling for that ! I 'll give you my telescope , anything . Please don 't tell anyone . - Have you done that ? - When did you do that ? I didn 't ! I 've just woken up with this ! - When did you finish the jigsaw ? - I didn 't . Oil Who 's been messing with my star charts ? I I 'm trying to do the comprehensive - nay , definitive - A-Z of the Universe , with street names , post offices and everything , and some git 's been fiddling with it . It 's not us . OK , which one of you chimpanzees did this ? ! Look , there 's a logical explanation for everything , with the possible exception of Jimmy Osmond . - Who ? - Hang on . Today 's Sunday , right ? - So ? - Well , the clocks say Thursday . My foot says get the person who did this . Four pages are torn out of me diary . - We 've lost the last four days . - Did you look behind the fridge ? If you lose something , it 's always there . - Aliens ! - What ? What are you talking about ? It 's a well-documented phenomenon . They give you a mind probe , erase your memory and put you back . - OK , aliens came aboard . - Without question . - They broke my leg . - They broke MY leg . - And then they did a jigsaw . - Right . Well , that 's cleared that up , then . Look , you 're not thinking alien . That 's what aliens are - alien . They do things that are ... alien . Maybe this is how they communicate . By breaking legs ? ! - And doing jigsaws ? - Why should they speak the way we do ? - They 're aliens . - OK , Professor , what does it mean ? Maybe ... Maybe ... OK . Breaking your leg hurts like hell , OK ? " Hell . " They do it below the knee . " Low . " " Hell-low . " Get it ? They do it twice . Twice . Two . " Hell-Low-Two . " And jigsaw must mean you . " Hello to you . " I wouldn 't like to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech . Hang on . Holly , the black box will have recorded everything , won 't it ? Yeah . Hang on . I 'll fish it out . It 's gonel It 's been half-inched . Wait a minute . Let me think about this . It gives off a signal . We can trace it . ( CRUNCH ) ( LISTER ) It 's the gearbox , I 'm telling you . - Nothing yet . - It 's impossible . It could be anywhere . It 's like finding a fart in a jacuzzi . Look ! Down there on that moon . - ( LISTER ) Are you getting a picture ? - Yeah , but the quality 's terrible . It 's like watching Spanish television . ( LISTER ) Oh , my God ! ( CAT ) What the hell is that ? ( LISTER ) Smegorama ! Er , Holly , start the engines . Keep her ticking over , yeah ? What is it ? ( LISTER ) A footprint the size of a surfboard . ( CAT ) I don 't believe it ! Can you imagine the problems this guy has getting fashionable shoes ? ( LISTER ) If it 's true what they say about feet , this guy could go to fancy dress parties as a petrol pump . I think you should come back . ( LISTER ) They lead round this corner . So , a huge monster drained our memories and broke a couple of legs . So what ? Forgive and forget , I say . ( LISTER ) This I don 't believe ! It 's a gravestone . " To the memory of the memory of Lise Yates . " - Who 's Lise Yates ? - You 're not going to believe this , but I went out with Lise Yates . It 's only shallow . The black box is buried in the grave . ( BLEEPS ) - Right , it 's loaded . - ( AS BOGART ) Well , play it , Sam . Nice-looking bloke . I don 't know if anyone will ever find this , but if they do and it 's you , Dave , or you , Arnold , don 't ever play it . Some things are best left buried . - Why have you frozen him ? - You heard him . - Knows his stuff , that dude . - Come on , Holly . From Saturday night . ( RIMMER ) Do you know how many times I 've made love ? Yes , we remember this bit . Spin on ! ( MOUTHS SILENTLY ) That many ? ! ( LISTER ) Another bit of sky . A star ... ( RIMMER WHINING ) This better be good . I was sleeping , and that 's my third favorite thing . Waking me at this time ! - What is this place ? - It 's the hologram simulation suite . - This room creates Rimmer . - Are we gonna blow it up ? Look , those are his dreams . That 's what he 's dreaming right now . Maybe I could really be good With someone to watch over me ... I 'm giving Rimmer the best present he 'll ever get . - ( CAT ) What are you doing ? - Recording me memory . - Your entire memory ? - Yeah . Everywhere I 've been , everything I 've learned . Right , that 's it . I 'm giving Rimmer a love affair . I 'll paste eight months of my memory into his . Whatever happened to me , he 'll think happened to him . - You 're giving him an old girlfriend ? - I 'm going to give him Lise Yates . ( CAT PURRS ) ( LAUGHS ) - God , Dave . I love you so much . - ( LISTER ) And I love you , Lise . A few minor adjustments . - God , Rimmer , I love you so much . - ( LISTER ) And I love you , Lise . Change the voice . God , Rimmer , I love you so much . ( RIMMER ) And I love you , Lise . - That 's it . - He 'll think all this happened to him ? Yeah , the whole eight months . Man , that 's a fine present . He was probably only expecting a tie . ( ROCK AND ROLL ) You 're in a good mood . Why not , Listie , when life 's so good ? Why is life so good ? You wouldn 't understand . You 've never been in love . - I have ! - Oh , not real love . Not like I have . Not fireworks in the sky , rolling naked on the beach kind of love . - Not like me and Lise . - So , who 's Lise ? Someone who was absolutely nuts about me . - That 's all you need to know . - Fine . You keep it to yourself . All I 'm saying is , from now on call me Tiger . Grrr ! An old girlfriend , was she ... Tiger ? What a crazy , crazy , year that was . The first three months , I was at Saturn Tech doing a course . Then , for absolutely no reason , I suddenly moved to Liverpool . I drank too much . I smoked too much . I became a total slob . I met Lise . I even started eating my own toenail clippings . My tastes in music radically changed . I stopped adoring Mantovani and got into Rastabilly Skank . - Crazy . - You were in love . You go a bit crazy . It was weird . I was nuts about her . - But I started treating her badly . - No , you didn 't ! I did ! I gave her some twaddle about not getting tied down . But you were young . You wanted to bum around . - I hate bumming around ! - You 're like that when you 're young . I wasn 't , so why did I say those things ? She wanted you to have a career . That 's what I wanted , so why did I finish with her ? Because ... you wanted to play the field . Right . I said I wanted to play the field . I must have been mad . She was great , and thought I was great . Yeah , man , you 're right . You were mad . She was a lover and a friend . - And beautiful . - Gorgeous . - Great sense of humor . - Terrific . - The sex was fantastic . - Amazing sex . - Brilliant sex . - Primo , dynamite sex ! Fantastic sex ! Stupendous sex ! - Lister ... - Brilliant sex ! - Lister , how do you know ? - I 'm just having a guess . No one will ever know how beautiful it was between me and Lise Yates . How could you do this ? It 's the most tragic thing I 've ever witnessed . Popcorn ? I 'm sorry , man . I thought I was doing you a favor . What 's this got to do with jigsaws , broken legs and footprints , eh ? Right , smegbrain , prepare to die ! I found the letters . - What letters ? - THE letters . - What letters ? - The letters Lise Yates sent you . Oh , smeg ! While she was seeing me , she was seeing you behind my back . And to pour salt into the wound , you took her to the exact same places . - Rimmer , it 's not what it looks like . - That woman is unbelievable . We stayed in a hotel and made love six times . You were in the same hotel and made love six times , too ! - Listen ... - Twelve times a night ? She 's sex mad ! - Listen ! - It 's a good job you were there . I 'd have been dead within a week . But it doesn 't make sense . She loved me . - She wasn 't seeing us at the same time . - I 've checked the dates . - She wasn 't going out with you at all . - She ... - What ? - You 've never even met her . That 's below feeble ! I gave you eight months of my memory . - What ? - It was a present . You gave me eight months of your memory as a present ? Yeah . That 's why I was an orphan , even though my parents were alive . That 's why I had my appendix out twice . I thought you needed it . You 've destroyed me , Lister . The woman I loved most in the whole world didn 't love me , she loved you . Rimmer , listen ... Rimmer , listen ... Rimmer ! Oh , smeg ! You should have bought him a tie . Come on , Rimmer . You 've experienced love . It made you more confident , more secure . - It didn 't happen . - It did happen . You fell in love in a way I never did . Nothing can take that away . That time she stuck her tongue down my ear . It was your ear . The woman I loved most in the whole world had her tongue down your ear . The most romantic thing I 've ever had down my ear is a baby bud . Come on , as far as you 're concerned you had a wonderful love affair , yeah ? And for some reason , it all went hideously wrong . Well , join the club . It 's you , me and everyone else in the world . - I don 't want to feel like this . - So , you 're in pain . But , Rimmer , if you go through life without feeling , never experiencing , you 're no better than a jellyfish , no better than a bank manager . I don 't want this feeling . I want my own memory back . OK . OK . I 'll erase the last four days . Lise Yates will never have happened . - But you 'll know about it . - Well , I 'll erase my memory , too . - And the Cat 's and Holly 's . - Fine , if they agree . - And the black box ? - I 'll destroy it . - It 's indestructible . - I 'll shoot it into space . - Someone might find it . - OK . We 'll bury it on some planet . ( LISTER ) I 'm going to drop it ! Put it down ! ( THUD ) ( CAT ) Why does he want a gravestone ? ( LISTER ) He said he wanted something , so it didn 't , like , disappear . ( GRUNTING ) ( LISTER AND CAT SCREAM ) ( LISTER ) My foot ! It 's broken ! ( CAT ) Help me find my toes ! OK , that 's it . Let 's go and erase our memories . It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere I 'm all alone , more or less Lt me fly far away from here Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose Drinking fresh mango juice Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun

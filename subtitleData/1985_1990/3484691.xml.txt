 You 're looking good , Dutch . It 's been a long time , General . Come on inside . Eighteen hours ago , we lost a chopper ... carrying a cabinet minister and his aide ... from this charming little country . We 've got a transponder fix on their position about here . This cabinet minister ... does he always travel on the wrong side of the border ? Apparently they strayed off course ... and we 're fairly certain they 're in guerrilla hands . Why don 't you use the regular army ? What do you need us for ? 'Cause some damned fool accused you of being the best . Dillon ! You son of a bitch ! What 's the matter ? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils ? Huh ? Had enough ? Make it easy on yourself , Dutch . OK ! OK , OK . You never knew when to quit . Damn good to see you . What 's this fucking tie business ? Come on . Forget about my tie . I heard about that job you pulled in Berlin . Very nice , Dutch . - Good old days . - The good old days . - Why 'd you pass on Libya ? - That wasn 't my style . You got no style . You know that . Come on . Why did you pass ? We 're a rescue team ... not assassins . Now , what do we got to do ? The cabinet minister 's important to our scope of operations ... in this part of the world . Our friends are about to get squeezed . We can 't let that happen . We need the best . That 's why you 're here . Go on . Simple setup . One-day operation . We pick up their trail , run ' em down ... grab those hostages , and cross the border ... before anybody knows we were there . What do you mean , " we " ? I 'm going in with you , Dutch . General , my team always works alone . You know that . We all have our orders , Major . Once you reach your objective ... Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge . Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John ... Claims he has misery , but he has a lot of fun ... Oh , baby ... Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Yeah ... Well , Long Tall Sally , she 's built sweet ... Yeah , OK . ... Uncle John need . Oh , baby ... Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Yeah ... Well , I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally ... He saw Aunt Mary comin and ducked in the alley ... Oh , baby ... Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Yeah , awoo . Delta one-zero . Roger , team leader . Rendezvous points and radio freqs ... are indicated and fixed . AWACs contact on four-hour intervals . Who 's our backup ? No such thing , ol ' buddy . This is a one-way ticket . Once we cross that border , we 're on our own . This is getting better by the minute . She 's built sweet ... She got everything that Uncle John need ... Oh , baby ... Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Yeah ... Well , Long Tall Sally , she 's built sweet ... Hey , Billy . Billy ! The other day , I went up to my girlfriend . I said , I 'd like a little pussy . " She said , " Me , too . " Mine 's as big as a house ! " See , she wanted a littler one 'cause hers was ... big as a house . Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight . Get that stinking shit out of my face , will ya ? Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here ! This stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus ... just like me . Yeah ? Strap this on your sore ass , Blain . That was in ' 72 . Me and Dutch both got one . Well , Long Tall Sally , she 's built sweet ... She got everything that Uncle John need ... Oh , baby ... Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Yeah ... Well , I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally ... He saw Aunt Mary comin ' ... That 's a real nasty habit you got there . Yeah , baby ... Whoo , baby ... Havin ' me some fun tonight ... Right . Gonna have some fun tonight ... . Gonna have some fun tonight . Whoo ... Have some fun tonight ... OK , bird two , prepare to cover me . You got it , leader . Never knew how much I missed this , Dutch . You never were that smart . Hawkins , you 're up . Lines away . The pilots have each got one round in the head . Whoever hit it , stripped the shit out of it . Took him out with a heat-seeker . Something else , Major . This is no ordinary army taxi . It looks more like a surveillance bird to me . Pick up the trail yet ? Billy 's on it . Heat-seeker , Dillon . That 's pretty sophisticated for half-assed mountain boys . I guess they 're getting better equipped every day . There were 12 guerrillas . They took the two men from the helicopter ... but there 's something else . What ? Six men wearing US-issued army boots . They came in from the north ... and then they followed the guerrillas . Mean anything to you ? Probably just another rebel patrol . They operate in here all the time . - See what you can find . - Yes , sir . What 's he got ? Same business . Guerrillas hauling two guys in the chopper ... followed by men with American equipment . Do you remember Afghanistan ? Trying to forget it . Come on . Let 's go . Oh ! God ! Holy mother of God . " Jim Hopper . " Mac , cut them down . I knew these men . Green Berets out of Fort Bragg . What the hell were they doing here ? I don 't know , Dutch . This is inhuman . Nobody told me there was an operation in this area . They shouldn 't have been here . Well , somebody sent them . The guerrillas skinned them ? Why did they skin them ? Ain 't no way for no soldier to die . What happened here , Billy ? Strange , Major . There was a fire fight . They were shooting in all directions . Can 't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush . I don 't believe he did . I can 't find a single track . Just doesn 't make sense . What about the rest of Hopper 's men ? There 's no sign , sir . They never left here . Hell , it 's like they just disappeared . Stick with the guerrilla trail . Let 's get the hostages . We move , five-meter spread . No sound . It 's time to let Old Painless out of the bag . Payback time . You 're ghosting ' us , mother fucker . I don 't care who you are back in the world . You give our position one more time ... I 'll bleed you real quiet and leave you here . Got that ? Aah ! Fuck you . Aah ! He killed one of the hostages . We move . Mac , Blain ... the nest . Billy , Poncho ... the guard . Hawkins , Dillon ... backup . Once they 're set , I hit the fuel dump . One down . What the hell 's he doing ? What the fuck ? Aaaah ! Show time , kid . Target 's the center , on the upper level ! Dutch , on your nine ! Get that mother ! Go . Hyah ! Stick around . Hostages are inside ! Knock knock . I got ' em ! Hawkins , call in position and situation . Get Connor for the hook ! You got it , Major . Shit . Mac , any sign of the other hostage ? Found the other guy . He 's dead , too ... and the kid from the chopper . But if they 're Central American , I 'm a Goddamn Chinaman . From the looks of it , our cabinet minister was CIA . Another thing , Major . We were lucky . Other guys we waxed ... Russian military advisers . Something pretty big was gonna happen here . Good work , Mac . Clear the area . No traces . Get the men ready to move . Right . Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick . You 're hit . You 're bleeding , man . I ain 't got time to bleed . Oh ... OK . You got time to duck ? This is goddamn beautiful . Goddamn jackpot . This is more than we ever thought we 'd get . Now we got those bastards . We got ' em . I think this is what you 're looking for . You set us up ! It 's all bullshit ! All of it . The cabinet minister , the whole business . Got us in here to do your dirty work . We just stopped a major invasion . In three days , they 'd have crossed the border . - Why us ? - Nobody else could 've done it . Pissed about the cover story ? I needed it to get you in here . What story did you hand Hopper ? Look , we 've been looking for this place for months . My men were in that chopper when it got hit ! Hopper was supposed to get them . He disappeared . He didn 't disappear . He was skinned alive ! My orders were to get somebody to crack these bastards ! So you cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder . What happened to you , Dillon ? You used to be somebody I could trust . I woke up . Why don 't you ? You 're an asset ... an expendable asset ... and I used you to get the job done . Got it ? My men are not expendable . And I don 't do this kind of work . Major ! We stepped into some real shit here . Air surveillance says we got guerillas all over . Can 't be more than one , two miles away . - How much time ? - Half hour , maybe less . Tell Mac we move in five . Wait . She goes , too . She 's got valuable information . She 'll give away our position any chance she gets . No deal . You 're still under orders , Major . You wanna make that call or should I ? She 's your baggage . You fall behind , and you 're on your own . Place is too hot for a pickup . They won 't touch us till we get over the border . Hey , Billy , give me a way out of this hole . Aerial says we 're cut off . The only way out is that valley that leads east ... but I wouldn 't wish that on a broke-dick dog . Not much choice . Poncho , take lead . Double-time it . Dillon ! Dillon ! Over here . Turn around . Why ? Thanks . Anytime . Billy ! Billy ! The other day , I was going down on my girlfriend ... and I said to her ... " Jeez , you got a big pussy . Jeez , you got a big pussy . " She said , " Why did you say that twice ? " And I said , " l didn 't . " See , it was because of the echo . It was ... . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! Over here . Over here . Over here . Turn around . Turn around . Ha ha ha ha ! Turn around . Turn around . Over here . Ha ha ha ha ! Anytime . Anytime . Goddamn . Whew . Buddy , buddy , buddy . I 've seen some bad-ass bush before , but nothing like this . I hear you . This shit 's something . Makes Cambodia look like Kansas . Que pasa , amigo ? A little taste off home . You lose it here ... you 're in a world of hurt . Come on , sweetheart . Stop sandbagging ' it . Now get up . Come on , get up . Would you get up ? Mierda ! Ni lo intentes . Maybe you better put her on a leash , agent man . Try it again ... please . Callate . What 's got Billy so spooked ? Can 't say , Major . Been acting squirrelly all morning . That damn nose of his ... it 's weird . What is it ? Billy . What the hell is wrong with you ? There 's something in those trees . Do you see anything ? Up there ahead . Nothing . What do you think ? I guess it 's nothing , Major . Please ! Please ! Aah ! Billy , break back . Back right . What the ... This isn 't her blood . What the hell did you do to him ? Major , you better take a look at this . Did you find Hawkins ? I ... I can 't tell . What in God 's name ? I think it 's Hawkins . - Where the hell is his body ? - There 's no sign of it . Ask her what happened . Que paso , mujer ? Mujer , que paso ? Qué fue lo que viste ? Quien fue ? Yo no se . Dime , mujer ! Quien fue ? Dime ! La selva se lo llevo . No estoy segura . No se . She says the jungle ... it just came alive and took him . Bullshit ! That 's not what she said ! What she said doesn 't make any sense . - Those sappers followed us ... - Hell , they 've been ahead of us ! This woman 's been running us right to ' em ! Hold it ! Why didn 't they take his radio or his weapon ? Why didn 't she escape ? Hopper . What ? They did the same thing to Jim Hopper . I want Hawkins ' body found . Sweep pattern . Double back . 50 meters . Let 's go . Come on in , you fuckers . Come on in . Old Painless is waiting . Sergeant ! Aaah ! Mother fucker ! Aaaah ! Fucker ! Mother fucker ! You mother fucker ! Aah ! What happened ? I saw it . - You saw what ? - I saw it . Blain . No powder burns , no shrapnel . The wound 's all fused , cauterized . What the hell could have done this to a man ? Mac . Mac , look at me ! Who did this ? I don 't know , goddamn it . I saw s-something . Not a thing , not a fucking trace . No blood , no bodies . We hit nothing . Dillon ... better get on the radio . Mac . - Sergeant ! - Yes , sir . I want a defensive position above that ridge ... mined with everything we 've got . Put him in his poncho . Take him with us . I got him . Vamonos . Major ... I set up flares , frags , and claymores . Nothing 's coming near this place without tripping on something . Thank you , sergeant . Mac . He was a good soldier . He was , um ... my friend . Good-bye , bro . Blazer one , I repeat , extraction necessary . Say again , Blazer one . Say again . BLAZER ONE : Request for extraction denied . Area is still compromised . Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner extraction . Priority , out . Next contact 0930 . Roger , Blazer one . 1030 hours . Damn bastards . They say we 're still in too far , and they can 't risk coming in . We 're assets , Dillon . Expendable assets . It comes with the job . I can accept it . Bullshit . You 're just like the rest of us . Shitload of good a chopper 's gonna do us in here anyhow . Sergeant ? Sergeant ! Sergeant ! Who hit us today ? I don 't know . I only saw one of them camouflaged . He was there . Those eyes disappeared . What was that ? Those eyes , they ... they disappeared . I know one thing , Major . I drew down and fired straight at it . Capped off 200 rounds in the minigun ... Full pack . Nothing ... nothing on this earth could have lived . Not at that range . Mac , you take first watch ... then you get some rest , OK ? Ask her what she saw . Ask her what happened to Hawkins . Go ahead , ask her . Qué pasó hoy ? Qué fue lo que viste ? Te dijo lo que sé . Fue la selva que se lo llevó . Qué más quiere que te diga ? Same fucking thing . The jungle , it came alive and took him . Billy , you know something . What is it ? I 'm scared , Poncho . Bullshit . You ain 't afraid of no man . There 's something out there waiting for us ... and it ain 't no man . We 're all gonna die . The man 's losing it . He 's losing his cool . Nothing but a couple guys running around ... . and we gotta take ' em . Still don 't understand , Dillon , do you ? Whatever it is out there , it killed Hopper ... and now it wants us . Here we are again , bro ... just you and me . Same kind of moon , same kind of jungle . Real number-ten night , remember ? Whole platoon ... 32 men chopped into meat ... and we walk out , just you and me . Nobody else . Right on top of them . Not a scratch . Not a fucking scratch . You know , whoever got you ... he 'll come back again , and when he does ... I 'm going to cut your name right into him . I 'm going to cut your name into him . - What the hell is it ? - Mac ! Where are you ? Over here ! Mac ! Aah ! Mac ! Fuck ! Mac , where are you ? Mac , where are you ? Jesus . I got you , mother fucker . I killed you , you fuck . Jesus , you killed a pig . Think you could have found something bigger ? Fuck you , Poncho . Fuck you . Where 's the girl ? Aw , shit ! Why the hell wasn 't anybody watching her ? Why didn 't she try to get away ? Look at her . She 's scared out of her mind . Major , you better take a look at this . Blain 's body , it 's gone . It came in through the tripwires . Took it right out from under our noses . That boar had to set off a tripflare ... because there ain 't no other tracks . How could anyone get through this ... and carry out Blain without us knowing it ? Why didn 't he try and kill one of us ? He came to get the body . He 's killing us one at a time . Like a hunter . He 's using the trees . Yesterday , what did you see ? You 're wasting your time . No more games . I don 't know what it was . It ... Go on . It changed colors like the chameleon . It uses the jungle . Blain and Hawkins were killed by a lizard ? That 's a bullshit psych job . There 's 2 or 3 men out there . Fucking lizard ! What 's your name ? Anna . Anna , the thing is hunting us . All of us . You know that . - What the hell are you doing ? - We 'll need everyone . I 'm taking her back . We leave in five minutes . - We 're not going yet . - Rendezvous is ten miles away . You think the chopper 's going to wait ? We make a stand now , or nobody will be left . There is something else . When the big man was killed , you must have wounded it . Its blood was on the leaves . If it bleeds , we can kill it . Look out . You really think this Boy Scout bullshit 's gonna work ? It can see tripwires . Maybe it can 't see this . Instead of complaining , maybe you should help . What makes you think he 'll come through here ? The trees have tripwires every 50 yards . This is the only way in . When I was little , we found a man . He looked like ... like butchered . The old women in the village crossed themselves ... and whispered crazy things , such strange things . EI diablo , cazador de hombres . Only in the hottest years this happens . And this year , it grows hot . We begin finding our men . We found them sometimes without their skin ... and sometimes much , much worse . EI que hace trofeos de los hombres ... means " the demon who makes trophies of man . " What you gonna try next , cheese ? Hey , Dutch . Dutch ! Shit ! Aah ! I got you , you mother ! I got you ! I 'm coming ! Mac ! Mac ! Get Ramirez to the chopper . Hold it . I 'm going after Mac . That 's not your style , Dillon . I picked up bad habits from you . Get your people the hell out . You can 't win this , Dillon . Maybe I can get even . Dillon . Just hold onto that damn chopper . Ohh ! Ohh ! He 's busted up pretty bad , Major . I can make it . I can make it . Get the radio . Forget the rest . Ohh ! Come on , Poncho . Ahh ! Ahh ! Long Tall Sally ... she 's built sweet ! She 's got everything ... that Uncle John need . Oh , baby . Oh , baby . I 'm gonna have me some fun . I 'm gonna have me some fun . I 'm gonna have me some fun . I 'm gonna have me some fun . I 'm gonna have me some fun . Turn around . Over here . Over here . Mac ? Shh . Out there . Past them trees . You see it ? I see you . I see it . Yeah ... I see it . You know , we can get this thing , Mac . You work your way down there toward him . I 'll get in back of him , flush him toward you . When I flush the son of a bitch , you nail him . I got a score to settle . We 've both got scores to settle . Vamos ! Vamos ! Come on ! Quickly ! Hurry up ! Don 't . Leave it . It didn 't kill you because you weren 't armed . No sport . Mac . Mac . Anytime . Aaaah ! Aaaaah ! Aaaaah ! Let 's go . Ahh . Billy ! Billy , let 's go ! Dame l 'arma ! Dame l 'arma ! Give me the weapon ! Dame la mano ! Aaaaaah ! Aah ! No ! Run ! Run ! Go ! Get to the chopper ! Yaaah ! Oh , shit ! He couldn 't see me . Arrrr ! Ahhhh . Aaaaah ! Arrrr ! Rrrrr . Arrrr ! Bleed , bastard . Arrrr ! You 're one ugly motherfucker . Arrrr ! Arrrr ! Bad idea . Arrrr ! Arrrr ! Come on . Come on ! Do it ! Do it ! Come on . Come on ! Kill me ! I 'm here ! Kill me ! I 'm here ! Kill me ! Come on , kill me ! I 'm here ! Come on , do it now ! Kill me ! What the hell are you ? What the hell are you ? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! OK ! Did you get it ? What the ... My God !

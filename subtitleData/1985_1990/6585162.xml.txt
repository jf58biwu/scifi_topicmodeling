 SWEETWATER Kicking me out , huh ? Kicking me out , asshole . Fucking asshole ! Roy ! Stop it ! Cut the crap . - He needs the kick ! - Hold him there . Hold him ! - You 're done here . You understand ? - I 'll be back ! I 'll be back ! Just wait and see ! Bastards ! Fuck , I busted him stealing . I suspected this for a long time . He even tried to steal the toilet paper , that fucker ! I 've never liked him anyway . Actually , it was good this happened , so we could finally get rid of him . Have you decided yet ? You 're moving out ? And Lisa too ? Good luck . Listen . Can you hear it ? Hear what ? My breathing . And your breathing . And the heart beating . I can hear my heartbeats . Can you ? So quiet here . So quiet it is , when you can hear your own heartbeat . I 'm happy we came here . Are you sure it 's not far from here ? We 'll see it once we 're over that hill over there . When you squint your eyes they look like stars . White stars arrive at Sweetwater . Red stars leave . Isn 't it beautiful ? Let 's go rest . I 'm almost sleeping already . Garbage for you , Allan ! Here , have some more ! We can sunbath here all day . No one can see us here . Take off the rest too . - What about our boy ? - He 's not coming . Come on . So nice ... So nice to do it outside . So you came afterall ? It is you who moved into the old container at the dump , right ? - You live here ? - Yes . I 've been here for 11 years . Since I stopped working . I was a doctor in Sweetwater . I ran a small clinic there . I ought to present myself . Doctor Anton Fischer . Call me Doc . No need to be so formal . It 's a rare thing to see other people out here . I 'm Allan . This is Lisa . - How old are you ? - 22 . You have children ? I saw a little boy with you . So young to be the mother of such a big boy . Marta ... we have visitors . They live in the old container over at the dump . I see . Well , if you really think a dump is the right place for young people to settle , - - Then be my guest . Marta ... I 'll say what I mean . No one should think I live here because I like it . She 's not well . She 's plagued by arthritis . She can lay in bed for weeks . Even months . - I have a well . - A well ? Yes , a well . To get water . It 's over here . I 'll show you . This time of the year there 's plenty . How much you want for the water ? - What ? - What kind of payment you want ? Payment ? Of course you need something in return for the water . Doc never knew to get paid for his services . It 's always been like that . He couldn 't even ask for decent payment for the dirty work he did in Sweetwater . I 'm sorry for this little incident . It was just a misunderstanding . The boy showed up at the wrong place at the wrong time . My name is Felix . My brother can have a bad temper . The boy came at a very unfortunate moment . No , no . There 's no danger here . My brother is very strong . You understand ? He can 't speak . I speak for both of us . When did you get here ? A while ago . We 're looking for jobs , haven 't found it yet . It 's difficult because ... , - - We 're not from here . Strangers are not very welcome here . Where do you live ? Over there . It 's not so bad over there . We have seen worse . Much worse . It 's all good . My name is Allan . This is my son . Boy . Nice to meet you . Boy , don 't touch him ! Boy , it 's dangerous . You could get infected and die yourself . We used to bury dead people . To prevent epidemics . - What 's epidemics ? - It 's when many people get sick at the same time . And the doctors can 't help them . Let 's go home . I 'll come back here and do it myself . You seem busy . - There 's a dead body rotting here . What 's going on ? Maybe the body that is rotting - - could be left alone to rot ? Dead things spread diseases . Maybe the dead things could be left alone . You know ... - If it 's left alone , it will rot away by itself . But a grave can be discovered . It can be opened . You have seen something you shouldn 't have seen . It is very Unfortunate . It 's very unfortunate for you . I know he was a policeman . I know he was murdered . I have no intention reporting this . The only thing that interests me is that we can live in peace out here . You understand ? This was most regrettable . You know , people don 't like strangers here . One day one of them arrested my brother on the street , and well , then my brother ... I understand . What do you do for a living ? We buy and sell stuff ... My brother takes care of the bad stuff . We have contacts , we 'll handle it . We 'll do some business . - - What are we going to ... - No ! Tell them about the water . Tell them there 's enough for everyone even though it doesn 't taste good anymore . And ... if it 's trade they 're doing ... - then perhaps they can get us some of the stuff we need . But we can not trust those devils ! Hold on . I 'm able to defend myself . I traded for it some years ago . I thought it was impossible to get guns after all the confiscations and prohibitions . It 's all total chaos in city now . It 's become more and more dangerous to go outside . People are fleeing the city . Scared to death . Disoriented . Out here it 's safe for now . But it 's still a good thing to keep . Who are you ? Allan . I live here with my wife and son . I 'm Mary Diamond . We arrived here last night , Smiley and I. You must meet Smiley . He likes to talk . We arrived here last night . Smiley thought this was a garage . I brought someone to see you . This is Allan . - He lives here . - Allan , Allan ... Mary ! What 's on the menu ? It 's all liquid . Breakfast . Where is yesterday 's bottle ? Glove compartment . Have a drink . I 'm a man of principles : Never the dark aquavit before noon ! So , Allan . You live here ? - For how long ? - For a while . These won 't keep in the heat . So we eat them . Hop on . I 'm happy we came , Mary . It 's no so bad , huh ? Here we can sit as the last heroes and watch the entire civilization go to hell . God , Smiley ! - You jut talk and talk and talk . - Sure darling , I talk , I talk . Yes , it was much smarter to come here than go into Sweetwater . The people there are just fading out anyways . Sitting in their small dumps . Barely have the guts to go to job and back . If they even have a job . Soon they probably won 't even dare that anymore . Let me introduce myself proberly . Smiley . That 's my first - and surname - Smiley . I 've always been called Smiley . Always landing on my two feet . No matter what . A little rough on the edge , but good enough at the bottom . What are you doing ? I think he fancies you , Mary ! - What are you gonna do about that ? - Knock it out , Smiley . Allan is different . Different ? - He has a wife and a child out here . - Come on , Mary - Most of your admirers are husbands and fathers . You know that . I see your an honest guy . A little dumb maybe ? No , no , not dumb . A bit naive maybe . Or inexperienced . But I see it in your eyes . You have a true instinct for pussy . And that 's not something you get to see everyday . No , the sexlife isn 't what it used to be . Hell , did they put some damn mercury in the food ? I have to go . - My friend , wait , have a drink ! - Lisa is waiting . Lisa ? Ahh yeah , you have to mind the wife sometimes . - See you - Yes , see you . You 're sure he 's not coming back today ? I got him almost everything , but it get 's more and more difficult . Soon everything goes up on ... The market . The black market ... Everything ends up on the black market . Wait a little bit before filling up the car . People talk , you know . So be careful , ok ? Hi . Hello . - Lisa ? - Yes . - I 'm Mary Diamond . - I know . Allan told me about you . Do you have any water ? We won 't have anymore ' til tomorrow . Lisa , are you pregnant ? Can you see that ? I know the signs . I had four sisters . Two of them died of it . The youngest wasn 't even as old as you are . She didn 't want a baby , so she bled to death . That 's nothing to cry about . Not now , anyway . It all happened a long time ago . You musn 't cry . You 're just a little to thin , a little anemic . That 's all . It 's not dangerous . But I 'm so afraid . I 'm so afraid it will hurt . I just can 't imagine giving birth in there . Maybe I 'll come to visit you sometimes . Now and then . You musn 't be afraid . You 'll be fine . I think it moved . Yes . It moved . Lisa ? Come . Come here . - Come . - Yes , I 'm coming . Hurry ! Does it hurt when he comes to you ? Yes . Don 't know , maybe it 's dangerous ? I 'll talk to him . Try to tell him to leave you alone for a period . First time we came here . Allan and I , - - Marta talked about Sweetwater ? And how you got your hands dirty there ? I 'm not against the law on abortion . But I broke it nevertheless because I found it stupid and injustice . I ran a large , illegal abortion clinic . In Sweetwater . First time I have roof over my head and can call it home ! My first real home . You like Mary . Yes . Me too . It was her idea to come visit me . And help me with the baby . Mary ! What happened ? I thought I would find you ... What happened ? Not much , Allan . Not much . The bastards beat me up . Took my money . But who ? The police ! Who else ? The police ? Most of them are invloved with trafficking girls themselves . They just can 't stand freelancers like me . So you ... . ? - You are a ... - Yes , Allan , I work the highway . I thought you had understand at least that much . And Smiley ? Yeah , Smiley ... Poor Smiley . He 's my comfort . He is also my burden . He took me off the streets and put me on the highway . It 's not so hard to work the highway as a lot of people think . Good old tricks . They take far too much time . Far too exhausting . Must men now just want a speed way rub . By the time we reach 180 - - It 's all over . Usually there 's a wet patch at the end of that turn . Right here , and not one more step . Thank you . My brother and I are grateful for our new home . Well , when you 're a freeloading parasite , the only proper place to live is right here : - Living in - and off - human 's garbage . When there 's no more ideological doors to open . When even the human thought isn 't even worth wiping your ass with - When matter conquers the spirit - Then our rightful place is right here ! Jesus Christ , I 'm so thirsty . I could not take it anymore . It 's so hot . Help me , I 'm sick . I can get aquavit with this water ! - You 're a damn useless parasite ! - Calm down , you 're not exactly a figther . Well well , the king of the apes . He steals water one more time , then shoot him . What happened ? Help ! I can 't see . It 's like ... Tell me what happened ? It was Roy Indiana . He was wearing uniform . He 's with the police now . They are going to kill you too , Allan . Get out of here ! Hury ! We 're here with you , Lisa . Stop , stop ! A girl . It 's a girl . A girl . A girl ! Have you heard , huh ? Have you heard , huh ? A little courtesan ! If only we could give you a little time . How is she ? She 's tired , but she 's ok . She 's sleeping now . I was on the highway today , but ... - I didn 't see you ? Smiley needed me . I wasn 't there today . What about tomorrow ? Maybe . Mary . Stop it . So we 're sitting here then . Ready to sink . This has been known by humans since immemorial times . While they 've been clinging on to the thought of solidarity . I once wrote a poem about it . A Poem ! Did I ever tell you I wanted to be a poet ? But that was long before the paper-rationing . Well , well , if it isn 't the quack himself . Well done ! Come here , come here ! Well done ! Here , have a drink ! I want to see her . You have not decided a name for the baby girl yet ? What will you call her ? Rain . Her name is Rain . Marta died yesterday . It 's been very difficult , since Rain was born . She ... She couldn 't get out of bed . I 'm glad I had the gun . Not easy . Quick . She didn 't notice anything . She ... She had slept in . It was for the best like that . - The best for her . The best for all of us . I think . What is a life today ? Marta wasn 't sick She just used it against me so I wouldn 't hand her over . Everytime I see that flying devil , I want to shot it . From now on You 're staying with me . I went to see the damn old doctor . What a strange guy . An idealist . Even after so long time out here . He still believe everything will change . And a new world will rise with us being the chosen ones . So ? No one can escape the reality . For how long you think we would survive , if it wasn 't for Sweetwater that throwes us a few bones every now and then ? Besides , none of us are able to do anything . We 're already as good as dead , and you know it ! How should we ever be able to build a new world . - A different world . - Shut the fuck up ! You 're talking nonsense , Smiley . Stop it now . Stop now , before you drown in your own vomit . She must have gotten infected by Boy . We can 't hold off the epidemic anymore . She won 't feed . You must try to get more in her . Could you try squeeze out a little more . There are anti ... There are antibodies in mothers milk . It was difficult to get . Everybody wants antibiotics now . Many are sick , a lot are already dead . Very unfortunate . All we can do now is wait . And hope . There isn 't more for me to do . I can 't do anything for him either ! I gave him antibiotics , I 've done what I could . He 's malnourished and too weak to fight it . He stands no chance . What are you trying to say ? He wants her to breastfeed the boy . Yes , yes , it could work ! It can 't hurt to try . Can you make her do it ? Lisa ? Lisa ? You hear me ? Doc wants you ... - ... to give Boy milk from your breast . Milk ! - Boy ? I should give Boy ... No , no . - Lisa . - I can 't do it . No ! - Lisa , please . - I can 't do it . - He 's sick ! He 's sick ! They both are ! We must try . - Lisa ! - Go away ! Lisa , listen ! Lisa , try ! Drink Boy , drink . Roy ? Roy ... You devil ... Hi Allan . Lisa is with Doc again . Allan , we can 't go on here . It 's too dangerous . More of them will come . We 're out of food , Doc 's well is nearly empty and without water it won 't work . Allan - - We have to leave ! Where ? I don 't know . Somewhere . A place where we at least have a chance . Allright . We 'll look tomorrow . Further away from Sweetwater . We 'll leave the rest here . For the time being . It 's dead , Allan . The world has died . We have to go back . Back to Sweetwater . We 'll leave . What ? We 'll go back . To Sweetwater ? Who are going ? Mary and I. And the baby . And no one else ? Lisa ? I wanted to talk to you about the gun . My gun ? No , I 'll need it myself . It hasn 't been safe here previously , and it 's only getting worse . No one will find you out here in the wasteland . - You 're wrong . - I must have that gun . If I get the gun , you can have her . Are you sure that you and Mary ... If I don 't get the gun , I 'll take Lisa with us . No ! Timing by Eazin Translated by Fabeldyr with help from Warz .

 Good evening , this is Howard K. Smith and this is the state of the war tonight . Good news from the big island of Hawaii . The daring Resistance leader Chi Chi Haspay ... has once again cheated death ... and escaped the sweep of the island alien command . And , at Land 's End in southern England , a violent hit-and-run goes on ... between the Robin Hood Brigade and the alien Fifth Air Wing ... as the British Freedom Fighters attempt once again ... to drive the Visitors from their shores . On the darker side , there is still no word from the Chattanooga volunteers ... who , three weeks ago , were driven into rugged terrain ... south of Lookout Mountain , following the occupation of southern Tennessee . Yet , from the ashes of destruction , our spirits are lifted by ... the tales of heroism we hear about from all over the country . This week 's medal of valor goes to Frankie Weatherwax ... a mechanic from Chapel Hill , North Carolina ... who single-handedly stopped an alien attack on a junior high school ... by taking over a laser cannon , and turning it on the Visitors . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York , our hopes are with you . Good night . Willie ! Simon ! We have got to make this fast . I think I 'm being followed . Charles is secretly shipping arms into the Open City . He 's preparing to ... Simon ! Don 't move ! You 're under arrest . Stop or I 'll shoot . Don 't worry . He won 't get far . Good evening , Los Angeles . It is now exactly two hours past curfew . All is quiet , and I 've instructed the police to see that it remains that way . May I ask you , once again , not to ... Kyle , have you seen Willie ? Our only hope for survival lies in peaceful coexistence . What is it ? Everything okay ? Look at his eyes . I 'm firmly committed to maintaining the peace in this city . What ? The Visitors assure me that all they seek is a lasting peace . Something 's gone . Those of you still fighting , I implore you to lay down your arms . We cannot win . That 's not my father . Kyle , your father has been through a lot . Maybe he hasn 't fully recovered from his wounds . That 's the point . He was shot at close range . The best doctors in the world couldn 't put him on his feet this fast . Think of the lives of your children and the life of our planet . Where are you going ? - Personal business . - I see . Is there always going to be personal business ? No . Just for now . Be careful . You 're risking the entire experiment by coming here . As far as I 'm concerned , the experiment is over . You 've served under me long enough to know how I deal with insubordination . Or would you like me to refresh your memory ? I don 't consider this insubordination . You were ready to let me die . You were in the wrong place at the wrong time . And I don 't intend to be there again . She 's fallen in love with you , hasn 't she ? Why does that frighten you so much when a woman wants you ? You should be used to that by now . You 're a master . I don 't care about this little Robin . Now either you approve my request for transfer ... or I take the matter directly to Charles . Is that what you 're going to do ? Well , let me make myself clear : You have a choice , Lieutenant Langley . You can either carry out your mission and impregnate Robin Maxwell ... or I 'll write a letter to your relatives ... that you were killed in action ... and burned beyond recognition . Well , that 's better . Now , tell me ... where is this Resistance headquarters that you go to ? And take the chance that you 'll blow it up with me still inside ? I didn 't just slither out of the swamp yesterday . Caution becomes you , John . Do try to smile . You 're supposed to be in love . Kyle , do you want your glove ? Elizabeth , they killed Simon . Come here and give me a hand . Press a little harder . How 's he doing ? He 's lost a lot of blood . Damn . What was he doing out there in the first place ? It doesn 't make much difference now . He was trying to meet a Fifth Columnist he knew . If I don 't stop this internal bleeding ... I don 't know what I 'm doing here . I don 't know their anatomy . You 're doing fine . Give me another sponge . - Is there anything we can do ? - Yes . You can get some help . Get a Visitor doctor , somebody . - The Inglewood complex . - We can try . This is damn risky . We don 't have any choice . Willie 's life is on the line . Looks like they 're changing shifts . - Keep your eye out for the doctor types . - How do we tell ? They 'll be the ones carrying golf bags . What 's the trouble , Howie ? Nothing , Doctor . Why do you ask ? You seemed a little nervous in the operating room . Did you hear what happened to Simon ? Charles promised to weed out suspected members of the Fifth Column . Apparently Simon was a suspect . Doctor , he was one of your best students . And so are you , Howie . That 's why I 'm going to give you a very valuable piece of advice . Don 't get involved in politics . Our job is to save lives . The question is , what 's the best way to save lives . Check out the armbands . Aren 't you coming back to the Mother Ship ? No , I 'm going to stick around for a while . I told this nurse I 'd meet her , we were going to go out . - You sure ? - That 's our man . All right , let him get a little closer . Could you help us , please ? My friend 's real sick . Please . Get in . Thank you , Lydia . Is everything proceeding as we discussed ? Yes . Most of the shipments of laser weapons are already in Los Angeles . Very good . You 've shipped heavy laser weaponry into the Open City ? We 're still doing it . In crates marked " medical supplies . " To be assembled on a moment 's notice . I 've taken the opportunity to do a little stockpiling ... while our gallant ally lies ill . You realize that you 've violated the provisions of our peace treaty with Bates ? Of course . But then , you won 't mind , will you ? - Thank you . - You 're welcome . We 've established a secret and highly potent armed force within his city . A brilliant plan , wouldn 't you say ? Yes , quite brilliant . My only regret is that I wasn 't able to assist Charles . We assumed you had your hands full with your genetic experiments . By the way , when will we see some results ? Soon , Lydia . Very soon . Yes , what is it ? A message for Charles . Thank you . Bates has just come out of his coma . I 'm going to pay Mr. Chiang a visit . - Who is it ? - It 's Robin . - Hi . - I thought you 'd never get here . - What 's so funny ? - Nothing 's funny . I 'm just happy . Good . John , do you ... - Do I what ? - Nothing . Come on , no secrets . Do I what ? Do you ever wish we were someplace else ? Away from the war and the Visitors and the Resistance . Just the two of us . All the time . But the war is everywhere . The only thing we can do is find an escape with each other . John , please . - John , I mean it . - So do I. I 'm sorry . I just don 't think I 'm ready for this yet . I don 't understand you . After all we 've said , what we 've been through ... I don 't understand myself . I just need more time . We don 't have any time . You 're hurting me . I do love you , John . I 'm sorry . What are you doing here ? Don 't tell me it surprised you to find a woman in your apartment . Not when I 've asked her to be here . But in your case ... Where is she ? I thought she 'd be with you and we could shorten up this process , considerably . I wish you 'd back off and let me do things my way . Of course you do . You have the vanity of a man who expects to succeed . We all have our little talents . But your talents are so special . What is it that these human females find so ... How do you say ? They like me . Like moths to a flame . How curious are you , Diana ? Let 's just say I 'm curious enough to come here and find out . Is this an order , Commander ? Elizabeth ! Can 't you do something ? Give him something to stop all this pain . I don 't know what to give him . If you don 't give him something , he 's going to die . Please . Okay . Hold him down , he mustn 't move . - We got him . - Thank God . There 's your patient , go to it . What 's going on here ? What 's in that ? That 's morphine . You use that , and you don 't need me . Morphine is poison to us . How is he doing ? He 's going to die . You don 't seem to understand , I care about this lizard . Look , he has lost too much blood ... this wound 's been open too long for me to heat-suture it . He needs an immediate transfusion and surgery to repair this damaged tissue . Can 't you please help him ? I 'm not a doctor . Our man ? I 'm going to be a doctor . I 'm still in medical school , though . Compared to you guys , I 'm an expert . In my expert opinion , we 're wasting precious time . Wait just a second . If it was me on the table , I wouldn 't want this clown operating on me . We don 't have an alternative , Tyler . Look , I 'm not going to be doing the operating . She is . What ? You 're a doctor , aren 't you ? Yes , I am , and I almost just killed him . Your friend needs a blood transfusion . And unless I 'm terribly mistaken , I 'm the only one who can do it . I know this procedure . I 'm gonna talk you through it . That 's it . - Now seal the outer right ventricle . - There are two . But be careful of those wispy fibers . Those are nerve conduits , very tricky stuff . Done . Good . Now just remove the damaged tissue . I 've got it all . If he can make it the next 24 hours , I think he has a chance . You don 't sound very optimistic . I 'm not . John , it 's Robin . Just a minute . - Hi . - Hi . I 'm sorry about before . I thought it over , and if you still want me to ... I want to stay . You do seem to be in a difficult position . Yes , Diana . Most difficult position . When Mr. Bates finds out ... what the computer impersonation has been saying ... I 'm afraid he 'll have my head . Mr. Chiang , don 't you think you may be overreacting ? I don 't think so . Bates will probably have him executed for treason . Oh , dear . Charles . Maybe you can persuade him . After all , I 've acted in everyone 's best interest . Of course you were . But I 'd hate to interfere . After all , Nathan Bates is the legal administrator here . - But he is incapable of ... - Don 't misunderstand me . I 'd like to help you . You 've been most cooperative . However , as long as Nathan Bates is alive ... You see , it 's really rather simple ... you kill Nathan Bates , and the city is yours . What 's going on ? What happened to Willie ? He was hit by a laser pistol . - Is he all right ? - Yeah . - Who 's he ? - He 's a Visitor doctor we borrowed . No , I 'm not a doctor . Can we trust him ? Let 's just say he 's got a stake in all this . Ham . What are you looking at ? Sorry . I thought I recognized you from somewhere . Must have been your nightmares . I was frying lizards . Were they pan-fried lizards or deep-fried ? No , I 'm just kidding . Everything happened so quickly I didn 't get a chance to ask you your name . I 'm Howard . My friends call me Howie . - Nice to meet you , Howie . - Julie , right ? Yeah . You showed some really nice moves in there . You 'd make a fine surgeon . Thank you . If it wasn 't for you , Willie wouldn 't have had a chance . - Who 's to say he does ? - What is that supposed to mean ? It means : How do we know what he had you do to Willie ... patch him up , or put him under ? - Do something . - My God ! Come on , Willie . He 's gone . No ! Take her to the cot . His heart . It 's beating again , normally . I can feel a pulse . He 's alive ! You all right ? I think so . Does she do this kind of thing often , or what ? As a matter of fact , she does . You 're the Star-child , aren 't you ? Gooder . I 've heard so much about you . Robin , please keep an eye on him . It just seemed like a fantasy for me . It 's the Star-child . Now for the magical question : What do we do with him ? - I 'll take care of him . - Hold on . We owe him something . I say we let him go . What 's to keep him from going straight back to Diana ? He knows everything about us . I won 't betray you . I want to help you . Diana is my enemy . I 'm a part of the Fifth Column . I thought you were purged when Diana returned to the fleet . Many of us were killed , and some were my best friends . That drove the rest of us to deeper cover . The fight goes on ! Nothing can defeat the struggle for freedom . On any planet . Well , you almost blew it today , didn 't you ? That 's not fair . He did the best he could . I was there . We have no real reason to trust him . Think about it . He came here at gunpoint . With all due respect to Julie , we can 't be sure of what he did for Willie . I don 't expect you to believe me . You 'd be stupid if you did . But I can prove to you that I 'm on your side . You 'd better . At this moment ... Charles is moving a massive shipment of armaments into the Open City . Dad , don 't try to talk . There are some things you 've got to know . I 've set up a system of underground tanks ... with concussion detonators set to go off ... if the Visitors try to take LA by force . A doomsday device . That 's why I had Chiang bring you here . Chiang didn 't bring me . He doesn 't even know I 'm here . What 's wrong ? If Chiang didn 't bring you here ... that means he 's gone over to the other side . You 've got to get out of here fast . No . Not without you . I made my deal with life a long time ago . I wanted power , I went for it . And I got it . But I lost you in return . Now there 's no need to say that I 'm sorry ... that I was wrong . My gamble . My loss . Yet , I love you , boy . Hang on , Dad . We 're gonna get out of here . I want you to do something you 've never done before . I want you to listen to me . And get out of here . Now . Dad , I love you . But I 'm not gonna leave you here . No way . They don 't keep patients in that part of the hospital . It 's used to store guns and liquid xenon . Liquid xenon ? What 's that ? It 's a fuel source for our cannons . It is used to triple the fire power . How do you know all this ? The Fifth Column keeps tabs on everything that 's high security . If this is a high security place , why is there only one guard ? They don 't want attention . Nobody 's supposed to have weapons in the Open City , remember ? Charles wouldn 't want to advertise his intentions . We still need proof . - Why don 't you believe me ? - Because you 're a lizard . Take a look . The kid could be on to something . This is called being sucked right into a trap . We better blow what 's down there before it blows us . I know a way we can do that . Easy . We 're almost there . Hold it . Come on . Well , Mr. Bates ... I see you have found your son . Mr. Chiang , I hired you because you were hungry . It 's nice to see some things don 't change . One must be practical . We 're leaving . I 'm sorry . No one is going to leave here . Dad , no ! Yes , what is it ? It 's from Lieutenant Langley . This is it ? We got cut off . Have my ship prepared in five minutes . Let me see your authorization . Pass . Can you guys give me a hand ? Appreciate the assistance . Come on . Wait by the ambulance . All right , Kyle , that 's enough . The game is over . I 'd feel a lot more secure using just plain old nitro . Blow this place sky high . All we need to do is create a meltdown so they can 't use the xenon as a weapon . - That 's according to Howie . - He got us this far . There are the medical supplies . You 're up . Hi . Maintenance check . You have a cryonic modulator on the blink . We 've had no reported problems . Funny , it says so right here . This is not valid . These orders require two signatures . - Here 's one . - Here 's the other . Buzz us in . Hi , how are you doing ? Come with me . What are you looking at ? Now I know where I know you from . Yeah ? Yeah , you 're one of Diana 's ... Gutless traitor . Killing the cooling system . Once the liquid xenon reaches its boiling point , those tanks will blow sky high . What 's to keep the cooling system from coming back on ? - I don 't think it will . - I 'm not taking any chances . They 're in the xenon control room . Get a move on , now . I 'll alert the other guard , sir . Let 's go . What were you just telling them ? I told them to kill your friends . That 's not funny . Where is Howie ? - Why are you doing this ? - Because I am one of them . Stop kidding . - I 'm not . - I mean it , John . Not again . Kindly disarm yourselves . Her life depends on it . Don 't look so startled , you didn 't overlook anything . I 'm just good at what I do . Very good . Get in ! Come on , come with us . No , I can do more for our cause if I stay . - What happened here ? - The Resistance , Commander . They destroyed the xenon tanks . I don 't know how they did it . But I bet he does . You 've disappointed me , John . So , at least you 're not pregnant . - You sure you want to do this ? - Yeah . If I stay here , I 'm going to go crazy . You sure you won 't change your mind and come with me to Chicago ? I love you , Mother . But I can 't . - Because of Kyle ? - Kyle and Willie . And the whole Resistance . Time to go . Just leave that . I 'll take it . We 're going to have to move it , if we 're going to meet Chris at the Mojave pickup . You okay ? With those two as escorts ... I 'll be in constant danger . Just want you to know that ... I want you to come back whenever you feel ready . Okay ? - I 'm gonna miss you . - I 'm gonna miss you , too . Say goodbye to Willie and everybody for me . Well , hard rock ... - you all set ? - Yeah . You 're not so bad for an amateur . But you 're still a sucker for a sad story . And I 'm not going to be around to cover your back . Take care . It matters . You watch the shadows . Do you think we 'll ever see them again ? English

 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the Visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food . The Resistance is all that stands between us ... and the Visitors . It 's no use ! They 've called in reinforcements ! - Everybody back , into that alley ! - Go ! I 'll give you cover ! This is no time to be resting ! Mike , it 's a dead end . Ten feet of solid brick wall . - We 'll blow it . - With what ? The grenades we don 't have ? It 's too late , Donovan ! There 's no way out . Don 't make this any uglier than it has to be . - Elizabeth ? Anything you can do ? - I tried , Mike . I can 't . It 's like I 'm changing . I 've lost my powers . Great . This is my final appeal . Lay down your arms and surrender . We will spare your lives . How many times have we heard that one ? We 've had our backs to the wall before . We 're not licked yet . You give me no choice . - All for one ? - And one for all ! I 'm ready . We started together , we 'll end together ! Okay , on my count of three ! One , two ... Cease all hostilities ! Return to the Mothership immediately . All Visitor troops are to return to the Mothership immediately ! I repeat , cease all hostilities ! All Visitor troops are to return to the Mothership immediately ! I don 't believe it . Elizabeth , did you ... - No . - Then why ? At this point , let 's not pick nits . We just got a major break . Sir , is this possible ? I repeat , cease all hostilities . All Visitor troops are to return to the Mother Ship immediately ! Let 's move , people . Well , Lydia ... this time you have overstepped the bounds of even your ego ! I demand an explanation for this cowardly withdrawal . Actually , I 'm not the person you should be speaking to . I 'm merely following orders . I was the one who issued the troop recall , Diana . Under whose authority , may I ask ? The Leader 's . He has declared that all hostilities be terminated immediately . Why , when we are so close to victory ? Apparently , the reports of your success ... have been overly exaggerated . - I can 't imagine how . - Oh , I can . For the moment , the war is over . The Leader is coming here himself ... to take direct charge of the peace negotiations . Peace negotiations ? You engineered this , didn 't you ? You 're a traitor . Just like your brother Martin . We both know that 's a lie . Fortunately , the Leader knows this as well . The truth is , Diana , the Leader has lost confidence in you . Your voice will no longer be heard . Right , New York . The same is true in Paris and London . Over and out . Nobody 's sure , but reports are coming in from all around the world . They 're all the same . I smell a trap . After wanting this world for so long , why give up now ? What if it 's a decoy , to throw us off ? It 's working like crazy . People think they are for real . The fighting has stopped all over the world . You know , we always talked about the war ending . How great it 'd be . Why does it feel so weird ? Guys ! Get in here . What 's going on ? - They 're messing with her mind . - No . She 's receiving a message . - What kind of message ? - From the Leader . It is his manner , to contact anyone ... or anything , over any distance . That 's crazy . Kyle , she is the Starchild . One of you , yet one of us . I must go . Where ? To the Mothership . The Leader wants me there . No way . Not until we find out for sure what the hell is going on around here . She must go . Easy . Next time , knock . Now , what do you mean , she must go ? Why peace all of a sudden , after years of warfare ? It is the will of our Leader . Now , I see he has made contact with Elizabeth . Is that part of the peace process ? She is the blending of cultures ... the Leader 's source of truth . Without her there will be no chance for a lasting peace . I say we take this one step at a time . First of all , why has the fighting stopped ? I can only speculate as to why the Leader called a cease fire . But since I arrived on this planet ... and met you , and learned from you ... I have tried to convince the Leader ... that your people and our people can live together . That one should not prey on the other . Elizabeth will enable him to see that . All right . But if she goes , we all go . I 'll make the arrangements . So , with as little advance warning as when they arrived ... the giant Visitor Mother Ships are withdrawing ... from the various major cities of the world . Reports from Paris , Rome , London , St. Louis ... all confirm worldwide celebrations ... that make V-J Day and V-E Day pale by comparison . This is Tawny Schneider , happy to say ... this may be the last broadcast of the Freedom Network . The fools . If we attack now , the entire planet will be ours by nightfall . A pity you hadn 't thought of that plan earlier , dear ... when the Leader still had confidence in you . Or in you , darling . In case you hadn 't noticed ... it is through Philip that the Leader is communicating . I must admit , you amaze me , Diana . What persistence you have . You absolutely refuse to accept reality . There is still time for the Leader to be fully informed of Philip 's act of deceit . You 're deluding yourself , darling . Philip has convinced the Leader that the humans are a noble race . - Is that what you believe , Lydia ? - What I believe isn 't important . My sole function is to serve our Leader . And I intend to do just that . That stays . How can we go up there unarmed ? We 'll be sitting ducks . Not if there 's a cease fire . Julie , what do you think ? Am I the only one who 's the slightest bit suspicious ? No , we 're all a little suspicious . But we 've always taken chances and I don 't think we should stop now . What about Elizabeth ? Look at her . The Leader 's got her brainwashed already . Kyle . You taught me to share your earth love . Let me teach you now about true love . That 's got nothing to do with ... I understand , more than you know . Your earth love is good , Kyle , and warm . But you know love only as it is tied to your bodies . In the cosmos , there is a greater love ... for there are no bodies . I won 't let you go . Kyle , we can 't stop her . All we can do is stay with her and see how this plays out . The shuttle is ready . So am I. She 's changing . Yeah , but into what ? I don 't like this at all . Now that we 're here , I can 't say I argue with you . - I think you 're both just a little jumpy . - Yeah ? What if we 're right ? What do we do about it ? Nothing . Yet . - I take it you know these people . - Intimately . Skilled fighters , all . Yes . It seems almost a pity we will not face each other in combat again . I didn 't think you felt pity , Diana . Maybe things have changed . I meant no disrespect . After all , if it weren 't for the armistice ... how else could I get the legendary Donovan in my grasp ? Elizabeth will need the appropriate garments . I 've already seen to it , Commander . It 's beautiful . It , like you ... represents unification , the bringing together of all living things . If there 's anything else I can do , don 't hesitate to ask . Look at her , fawning all over them . Lydia 's attempting to become a diplomat . She 's making a fool of herself . Perhaps she 's aware of something you choose to ignore . When a war is over , there 's no reason to keep the warriors . That 's why we are going to make certain the war goes on . With us , such games are customary . A way of honoring the Leader and letting off steam at the same time . Creative combination . You find that one interesting ? He knows he 's beaten , you see . In real combat , those swords would be charged ... with nuclear disintegration loads . One touch on the body would mean instant death . Sort of takes the sport out of it , doesn 't it ? Interesting perspective . Would you like to try it some time ? With uncharged weapons . Of course . However , I must warn you , I 'm pretty good . I was trained by a venerated master . I 've seen all the Errol Flynn pictures . Then I consider it an even match . Thelma ! Willie ! I thought I 'd never see you again . I was sure I 'd never see you . This is unbelievable . It certainly is . They told me you were dead . No . I have been living among the humans . How ? Why ? It 's a long story , Thelma . I 'd love to hear it , Willie , the whole thing . This is too good to be true . Getting you back , it 's like a miracle . We can pick up right where we left off . I 've never forgotten you , Willie . I never stopped dreaming about becoming your wife . You can 't be serious . The two of them mean to fence with the nuclear swords ? Unarmed , of course . It seems they have become fast friends . Too fast , for my taste . I always suspected Philip was a traitor . That 's why it 's so perfect , don 't you see ? I begin to , yes . You simply arrange it so that their swords are charged . Neither of them will suspect ... since Philip will have ordered the safe arrangements ... they will fight , and when one of them kills the other ... that should mean the end of this horrid d√©tente . Perhaps you 'll be lucky , Diana . With two such equally matched fighters ... each might kill the other . Mike 's got a lot more faith in Philip than I do . Like he says , Philip hasn 't let him down yet . That doesn 't mean his luck will hold forever . I do love an athletic contest , don 't you , James ? Would you care to place a wager on the outcome ? No . For them , the stakes couldn 't be higher . And once Donovan and Philip are taken care of , we turn to the Leader . Are you sure you want to go through with this ? Right now I can 't come up with a reason not to . I can . Those swords are supposed to be lethal weapons . They 've been de-charged . They 're harmless . Listen , Kyle , it 's a ritual duel , not a fight to the finish . Just in case anything does go wrong ... I 've got a shuttle ready in Bay 3 . Get Elizabeth and everybody there . You can count on it . Good luck . Go easy on me , Mike . Sorry . I play to win . Always . If these weapons were charged , the energy emanating from the tip ... - would penetrate through the outer tissue . - Not a pretty picture . So much for fun and games . - Who was responsible for preparing these ? - I did it myself . But obviously someone got to them before we fought . Obviously . I 'll get to the bottom of this at once . With peace at hand , the last thing we need among us is a lunatic . It 's good to be back , isn 't it , Willie ? I mean , among friends . Yes , I am very happy . Me , too . I spoke with my mother back on the home planet . When I told her you 'd come back , she wanted to start planning the wedding . Wedding ? Thelma ... I think you may be ... rushing things a bit . I 've gone through some changes ... since we last saw each other . Willie , are you saying you don 't want to marry me ? Up until a few hours ago , I hadn 't been thinking about it . All I can say is , I don 't have an answer yet . How could you , after I waited all these years ? Thelma , will you listen to me ? Our union has been arranged since we were in the incubator together . Before we even hatched , our families agreed that you and I would be married . Thelma , you don 't understand . I 'm not even sure I do . But since I 've spent so much time on Earth ... in many ways , I 've come to think like a human . I don 't care about your siding with the Resistance . That will all be forgotten . Daddy has a lot of important friends . It won 't go on your record . That 's what I mean . I don 't care about my record . Thelma , listen . I 'm not going back to the home planet . Thelma , it 's got nothing to do with you personally . Excuse me , Willie , but I 'm afraid I don 't handle rejection very well . Had you been able to carry out the assassination ... this loathsome truce would have already ended . Now we 're forced to deal directly with the Leader . Surely , you 're not proposing that we overthrow the Leader ? Why not ? You 're no stranger to ambition . Here 's your chance to bypass all your fellow underlings ... and get a taste of real power . And if I refuse to join your conspiracy ? Unfortunately , you 're already part of it . I 've been conducting an investigation of Philip 's most recent brush with death . I must tell you , there is considerable evidence ... that the entire plot was your brainchild . You 'd throw me to the wolves , just like that ? Without a moment 's hesitation . Really ? I thought you 'd be inclined ... to keep me around for a while . Don 't flatter yourself , Lieutenant . I can easily find other means of relieving my boredom . Now , are you going to help me reverse Philip 's treacherous peace plan ... or have you capitulated to his whims like Lydia and the others ? I 'm no lover of peace , Commander . But unless you have what I consider a flawless plan ... to terminate the Leader ... Don 't worry , Lieutenant . I do . Elizabeth , you 've got to be realistic . I mean , look what almost happened to Donovan . We know there are doubters in both camps . But we 've got to give peace a chance . Okay , let me get right to the heart of the matter . I don 't want to lose you . Kyle , that 's not fair . I don 't care if it 's fair . It 's true . Can 't I do anything to get you to back out of this ? No . Sure you won 't reconsider ? I wish I could ... but you 've always known there was another side of me . I 've got to go . Philip wants to talk to me before the Leader arrives . Wait a minute . Maybe he should talk to both of us . Kyle , I 'll be all right . But thanks for caring so much . I can 't help it . I love you . Elizabeth . I just saw Philip . He asked me to apologize for him ... but he 'll be a few minutes late for your meeting . Thank you . You 've certainly grown to be a beautiful woman . I hope that we 'll get a chance to spend more time together . I still feel very close to you . I don 't feel that way toward you . Not now maybe . But you 'll see , time heals all wounds . Was there anything else ? No . I just wanted you to be aware that the Leader 's behavior ... can be very unpredictable . If events were to change , unexpectedly ... you 'd always be able to turn to me . I can 't imagine why I 'd ever turn to you . I can . The Starchild was a former pupil of yours , wasn 't she , Diana ? Yes . For a brief time . It was I who first made her aware of her powers . She didn 't seem all that grateful . My mind is full of strange and inexplicable images . The names and configurations of galaxies I never saw ... the sounds and furies of ancient battles and mystic rites ... live in my dreams . And all of this disturbs you . How could it not ? And the feelings ... so intense , so violent that they torture me . And I cannot explain them . Elizabeth ... now , more than ever , you must be strong . You are the Starchild ... the bringer of peace ... the unifier of cultures . What you are experiencing is the racial memory ... of one strain of your ancestry : Ours . It is time you were introduced to yourself , Elizabeth . Then teach me . Now . The history begins many cycles and sequences ago ... on Sullam Voe . What did Philip say ? What could he say ? That Diana charged the swords ? You know as well as I do that she 's too shifty to be directly involved . But if she 's behind it ... what 's to stop her from trying to sabotage the truce again ? Time , for one thing . When the Leader gets here , she 's finished . And if she isn 't ? Then I 've got the shuttle in Bay 3 ready for a quick getaway . At least there 's a Plan ' B . ' We still have Philip 's word that the Leader 's for peace ... one-hundred percent . I 'll believe that when I see it . Two days ago we were mortal enemies . Now it 's like we 're long-lost lovers . I can 't shake this feeling that we 're sitting on a time bomb . I hope it doesn 't go off . Quickly . We don 't have much time . Excellent . Very good . Now are you sure you 're familiar with how to use this ? Yes . But it would be much easier with a laser cannon . The idea is for the assassination ... to look like an act of Resistance terrorism . Just do as I say , and within an hour ... you both will be hailed as galactic heroes . We better be . You will be . Ready or not , here he comes . I 'm always ready , Lydia . For anything . It 's the Resistance ! On the catwalk ! I knew they couldn 't be trusted . They disintegrated . Now we 'll never know who they were . Which is very convenient for whoever staged the attack . We know who staged the attack . Take them away . Halt ! Put your weapons down . You 've gone too far this time , Diana . This is mutiny . Call it whatever you like . But before you attempt to override my authority ... see how many of your forces will follow the orders of a commander ... whose friends assassinated our Leader . You 'll never get away with this . Don 't be a fool . I already have . You made the mistake of growing soft inside . For that you must pay . I 'm going to send you where you won 't be dangerous to anyone ... not even yourselves . Prepare them for permanent orbit ... around the asteroid of your choice . Farewell , my friends . - Not her . - No ! - She stays with me . - Attention all hands . Prepare for the arrival of our Leader . I 'm afraid you 've shown your true colors , Diana . You see , I know that the Leader is arriving on the second shuttle . I suggested it as a safety precaution . Unfortunately , you proved it to be a necessary precaution . Let her go . Do as he says . Very clever , Philip , but you haven 't won yet . Seal all the corridors and meet me on the bridge . Elizabeth , can you hear me ? Yes . I can . He knows you are here . I feel that . I am in communication with him now . The time is coming when he will meet with you . I 'm ready . We must protect you until that moment . Come with me . Set all infusion reactors to reach critical mass . Diana , the force of an infused nuclear reaction would destroy ... not only the Mother Ship , but the entire planet as well . All the better . - How long will that take ? - Exactly four minutes . If I cannot rule this ship , I 'll see to it that no one does . Seal the doors . But what about Lieutenant James ? He should have been here by now . We can 't wait any longer . It 's nice to know your timing is still impeccable . Diana 's sealed off the bridge completely . That gives her absolute control of the fusion reactors . She can blow us all to infinity . Along with herself . She 's capable of that . For her , the die is cast . She can 't go back . She attempted to depose the Leader . So what do we do ? If we can penetrate the hold , it will shut down the power source . Let 's give it a go . We 're all going to die . It doesn 't look great right at the moment , that 's true . Since everything 's about to end ... will you do something for me ? Probably . What ? Can you ... Say it , Thelma . Just , please , tell me that you love me . Or that you once did . I did , Thelma ... and I 'm not sure that love ever totally died . If things were different ... if this were another time and place ... How do you feel about Earth ? With you , anywhere would be paradise . We wouldn 't have to get married right away . We could live together for a while ... What are you doing ? This is a human custom you 'll have to get used to . What is it called ? A kiss . That is a wonderful custom . If we make it , if we live through this craziness ... I want you to be my wife . We 'll make it . Even if I have to stop Diana myself . Ready ? Fire . Nothing . We need more power ! There is no more ! We have to blow that door . That fusion reactor room is the heart of the Mother Ship . Diana 's got this ship locked up tight . What will we do ? Then , there 's nothing we can do to save the Leader or Earth . Wait ! There is one thing . Willie , what ? Anything . This . She is the Starchild . And if the Leader designed all this ... and can communicate through her ... He can use Elizabeth to undo all this ! Willie , please . Let me speak to the Leader . Can she do that ? If he wishes it . Is there any other way in there ? I used to work in the ventilation systems . Yes ! Show me . This way . They 've broken into the reactor hold . We 're beaten . No ! See the console ? - What will we do now ? - There 's only one thing to do . Quick , the shuttle bay ! I wouldn 't if I were you ! Good . Very good . Let 's go . Good luck wriggling your way out of this one , Diana . Don 't bait me , Lydia , for I shall return . Keep them well-guarded . Once the Leader is gone , they will be taken back . For a trial ? Our justice is far quicker than yours , I promise you . But just as lasting . My brother was a wise man for choosing to trust you , Donovan . Your brother was my friend . As you are . Your planet is a good one . You fought a valiant fight to save it . - Do not misuse it . - I 'll do my best . Thanks again . It is time . Come to me , Elizabeth . I think she needs to go . The moment they reach the Dark Zone , Earth will be ours ! Are you sure ? I left a " going away " present aboard the Leader 's shuttle . He should get a big bang out of it ! You sure this is all right ? I can feel it . She may find true peace and happiness . Who knows ? Maybe we all will . Wait ! Where 's Kyle ? - He was just here a second ago . - You don 't think he ... He stowed away . English

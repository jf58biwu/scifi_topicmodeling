 [ crowd cheering ] Strike ! That pitcher got a delivery as pretty as anything I 've seen . And an iron arm too . [ crowd cheering ] Hey , alright ! Now , that 's baseball , huh ? [ crowd cheering ] Time ! [ crowd applauding ] What 's that thing on the field , the mascot ? ( male # 1 ) That guy costs us a $ 100 each game . But he 's worth it . Yeah , well , all he ever does is hold up the action . What 's he doing ? ( male announcer ) Now , batting for Shuster , number 16 . [ crowd cheering ] ( male # 2 ) Attention ! Attention , everybody ! You are in danger . A bomb will explode in 30 seconds . This is your only warning . Leave this complex immediately . How about us getting out of here ? I 'm not letting any weirdo chase me off my job . Besides , they 're bluffing . [ ominous music ] Come on . Let 's play ball . Maybe it 'll calm down the crowd . Come on ! ( male announcer ) Stay calm , please ! Keep to your seats , everybody . The game will continue . [ engine revving ] [ intense music ] [ crowd cheering ] [ shrill squeal ] [ crowd cheering ] Come on , let 's play ball . Where 'd he go ? Coach says I 'm to pinch-hit for you . Go get ' em . ( male announcer ) Substituting for number 16 , number 7 . Come on ! Clark ? [ crowd cheering ] He he ! [ explosion ] # I 'm glad they came along # # I dedicate this song # # To all the girls I 've loved before # - Beautiful , Clark . Beautiful . - That was splendid . Oh , what are you guys doing here ? Oh , man ! Okay , Clark , I said a level , not an audition . - Everybody 's a critic- - - Hey , let an expert try it . Uh , the Boardwalk and Baseball amusement park .. ( Lana ) T.J. ! ... when homerun hitter , Clark Kent slammed a bomb out of the stadium , thereby preventing injury and possible death . ( Clark ) Okay , T.J. , that 's enough . - Hey , there 's Judd ! - ' Hey . ' Mr. Faust , Clark Kent , Shuster Herald . - Judd . - T.J. White . Alright . Can I get one more shot there ? Uh , one 's my quota for the day . The sound crew . ( Clark ) And of course , uh , Marilyn . Hi . - Betsy . - Hi . - Susan . - Mm-hmm . And Lana . - I really love your music . - Thank you . ( Clark ) Judd 's in town to get his honorary masters degree in music . And he 's graciously agreed to do a concert for us , student body . Well , it 's the least I could do for my Alma mater . - Judd , ready when you are . - Oh , great . Let 's go . - Excuse me . - Yeah . Testing one , one . # Love can leave scars that may never show # # A one-sided heart can just be physical # # Is this love physical # It 's okay ? Wow , isn 't he great ? Anyway , after I retired from baseball I signed on here as manager of this park . Anything else I can tell you ? Yeah . Why the bombing yesterday ? Oh , there are bunch of incidences . The bomb was the first Major League scare . Couple of weeks ago all the refrigeration units in the cafeteria blew out . Spoiled about $ 10,000 , $ 12,000 worth of hotdogs and ice cream . And the inspector said that was no accident . Come here , let me show you something else . Not exactly the Mississippi , is it ? You know you can 't have flume rides without water . And you can 't have water if somebody sabotages your water pumps . Andy , you must have some idea who , who 's hassling you . About a month ago , I got a visit from this guy who says he 's a representative of a conglomerate that , uh .. ... in-interested in buying the park . ( Andy ) And not only that , but he 's offering a pretty good penny . I said to him , " Forget it , fella . People who own it aren 't interested in selling . " He says to me like he didn 't even hear what I said , " They 'll sell . " And two days later , that 's when the mischief began . [ shrieks ] He didn 't make it . He 's still hanging down there . [ indistinct chattering ] This looks like fun . How about it , huh ? We 're here as reporters , T.J. Hey , I didn 't suggest we dive off the Golden Gate Bridge . I 'm sorry . - It bothers you , doesn 't it ? - It doesn 't bother me ! - Yeah . - Maybe it bothers me . It 's not like I 've a right to be upset . Say that again . Wanna etch that in my brain for future generations . [ whimsical music ] Hey , guys ! - Hey . - Hey , guys . Didn 't know you guys were coming here today . Ah , neither did we . You guys wanna hit the Ferris wheel ? Thanks , Judd . I think we 're gonna go- - I accept for the two of us . Great . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? - Mm-hmm . I collect matchbook covers from all around the world . Take a look at it . It 's unique . [ pleasant music ] ( male # 2 ) Attention , everybody ! Attention . You are in danger . Another warning . Lights out . Andy , we 're cutting in the backup generator . You again ? Do you even know what trouble you 've caused me ? [ intense music ] Our last and final offer . Get away from me . [ music continues ] You senile old fool ! You should 've taken the offer . I 'm going to call the police . ( T.J. ) What a mansion ! But do we need a tour of it ? Please try not to touch anything . Follow me and I 'll show you my comic book collection . Oh , Judd , you 're terrific . I mean for having us all here . But a little weird .. I 've been collecting comics five , six years now . They 're great . Totally cool . Yeah , I can sit in here for hours . After a most unusual lunch , Judd Faust took us for a tour- - I mean , you could do ten columns on his collections , huh ? Obsessions of the rich and famous . [ laughing ] Yeah , it is kind of weird . What did he have in that last room ? A 150 neon signs ? I stopped counting after I went color-blind . ( Lana ) Would you guys come on ? ( Judd ) This is my favorite collection . # Some would say # # That falling in love that makes the flame of each other # # Run away # # But I say # # You don 't talk in the same way # # You seem to know that 's the fast way to my heart # # Give me a thousand words # # You gotta send out the message for love to be heard # # Hey baby # # We need a translator # # Somebody to say Parlez vous Francais # # That way # # I won 't lose the meaning # # When you speak the feeling in your heart # # Give me a thousand words # [ car revving ] [ intense music ] [ shrill squeal ] ( man on recorder ) Attention ! Attention , everybody . You are in danger . Serious danger , pal . Now , turn it off . Are you crazy ? This man is my guest . Clark , please forgive him . He 's my manager . He probably thought you 're a burglar . Didn 't you ? Yeah . ( man on recorder ) A bomb will explode in 30 seconds . An offer was made to buy Boardwalk and Baseball . When it was refused , a bomb was detonated evidently by your man . It appears he was acting on your orders . It would certainly seem so . Is this your equipment ? Did I have anything to do with your outrageous acts ? No , Judd . No , no . I 'm gonna have to call the police , Charles . No . ( Judd ) Operator , will you get me the police ? Will you please go in the house ? Clark , will you please join the others ? Hello , police , this is Judd Faust . # What I want is stimulation # # Coming from this heat # Wasn 't Clark supposed to be here ? He went to tell Andy that Charles the guy who 's been bothering him , he 's in jail now . # Love can leave a scar that will never show # [ intense music ] What 's goin ' on ? Getting drunk on the job ? Ha ha ha . Violating your trust as manager of this glorious park . Causing the death of innocent people . [ chuckling ] How happy your employers are gonna be to get rid of this hard-luck property . [ laughing ] # Love can leave a scar that will never show # # A one-sided heart it gets me physical # # Is this love physical # # One thing I insist # # Life is about this # # So tell me is it love or is it sex # [ crowd applauding ] - Did you like it ? - Wonderful . Almost a perfect day . I 'm gonna make it perfect . Andy ? [ theme music ] [ screaming ] Are you okay ? Oh . I 've been banged up worse before . Are you sure you 're okay ? As long as I never see that guy again . I thought he was in jail . What the .. ( Charles ) Hey , put me down ! [ screaming ] There 's one last collection I 'm gonna show you . Only special girls get to see this , Lana . [ sighs ] You collect , um ... torture instruments ? ( Judd ) No . I collect the screams of torture victims . [ screaming ] [ mumbling ] Cut it out . This isn 't funny . I don 't like this game , Judd . - You 'll get to like it . - Judd ! - Where is Judd ? Isn 't he here ? - No . Bet Andy was happy when you told him that Charles is in jail . He is now . Charles tried to kill Andy on Judd 's orders . Let 's call the police and let them take it from , from here . - What 's the matter ? - It 's Lana . She went with Judd . Hey ! Hey , wait for me . Stop the instruments . It 's killing me . I can 't imagine the exquisite pleasure you are gonna feel . That we 'll both feel . When I put this to my digital sampler my next album will be perfect . [ Lana screaming ] And that 's .. Excellent . Excellent . [ Lana screaming ] Not quite as good as the other three . Put force . Excellent . Excellent . [ screaming ] Two more twists . ( Lana ) Superboy , no ! ( Lana ) Judd said something like not as good as the other three . What happened to them ? You don 't wanna know . Yeah , I do . The police found them . They were buried in the basement . He 's a collector alright . Weirdo collector . You know , I don 't understand the amusement park thing . Why did he want that so badly ? The police psychiatrist , he said that he wanted it so badly because he couldn 't have it . I guess an extreme recession like that can make a weirdo out of anybody .

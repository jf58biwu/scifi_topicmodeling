 Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * * Who are you ? Your mother was my friend . What do you want from me ? ! I wanna help you . I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . It sure is a beautiful campus . Hey , I 've been thinking I might apply my here , when I 'm ready for college . You know my science teacher says I have a remarkable aptitude for astronomy . - They figured it 's in my blood ? - Yeah , maybe . Maybe it 's because I helped you with your last homework assignment . Well , I got an A on the test , I did that by myself ! I wish I could got to the lecture with you . I 'm gonna go over and check out the job center on campus . See what 's posted . All right , good idea but whatever you get , remember , just make sure it 's ... Low profile . Right . - Take notes , huh ? - Yeah . Alright . I 'll see you Friday at five . Are you here for the tests ? I 'm not sure ! The notice I read said something about a job . We 're doing a series of psychology tests . We pay $ 25 an hour , to participate you have to be available for two hours at a time on two consecutive days . What do I have to do ? Just answer the questions . Like the tests you used to take in grade school . Oh , huh , those ... Interested ? Yes ! When do you wanna start ? How about now ? Fine . I 'm Katherine Bradford . Paul Forrester . Which of these colors you feel is the most dramatic ? Blue . Which define the most restful ? Blue . And which do you think best illustrates ... the feeling cheerful ? Blue ! You associate all three feelings with the same color ? I like blue . Which of these do you feel best illustrates the word " discovery " ? The United States of America . I said discovery , not democracy . I know ! Which do you think best illustrates the word " freedom " ? This one . Which best illustrates a conversation ? A conversation ? This one . You said " dolphin " ? I read somewhere that the dolphin is some of the most intelligent creatures on the Earth . What ? You think I got it wrong ? Let 's just say your answers were a little off the beaten track . I bet you threw a real blimp on their curb I would have loved to have seen the guy 's expression when you said " dolphin " ! Probably thought you were pulling his leg . You mean " her leg " ... Oh , ho ! A lady psychologist ! Was she pretty ? She was ... beautiful . [ STAN SAYS YOUR BOARD ] is not paying the slightest attention to your work . In fact , he sent over the results of one of those tests you gave yesterday . The subject doesn 't fit any of the four personality types . Even any of the sub-groups ! It 's not my fault . I just write down what they say ... I can 't help it if they don 't choose to cooperate . Damn it , Katherine ! Look , you shouldn 't even be doing this kind of work ! You know that as well as I do ! Stan only took you in as ... as a favor to me . Come back where you belong ! I don 't belong here , Dan . Not now ! The hell you don 't ! Why are you fighting this ? Ever since Andrew died , you ... crawled into a shell . You don 't give a damn about your yourself , about work , about anything ! The work I love doesn 't exist anymore ! It does ! It is going on right now ! That 's why we need you back ! Finish what you started ! You don 't give up a lifetime of work for some lousy misunderstanding . Misunderstanding ? Is that what you call it ? Katherine . Your husband was a good man and a brilliant scientist . He didn 't wanna deceive you anymore than I did . But he understood what we were up against . Why can 't you ? Every ... Every scientific program is getting their budget cut . If we wanna continue our work , we have to go where the money is . You can go with ... Speak of the devil . Katherine , this is Major Holmes . Doctor Bradford , an honor and a pleasure . You can go where the money is you have to . But count me out ! I can 't count you out . There 's five days left before the money runs out . Doctor , I 'm afraid the only way we can renew that grant , is with you leading the team . Katherine ! Hello ! Mister Forrester . Paul . You 're the last person I expected to see here . Didn 't have enough fun and games yesterday ? What d 'you mean ? You 'd be happy to know your little comedy routine worked like a charm . Those answers you gave , nearly cost me my job . I didn 't mean to get you into trouble . Didn 't you ? Well , then why all those off-the-wall answers ? I may put a blimp in your curb but the answers I gave were the way I felt . Alright then . Let 's give it another go , shall we ? What does this look like to you ? A man with a telescope . And this ? Two mice ... touching noses . Rain ? And rainbow . What do you see here ? I see a woman . A woman ? Yes . A woman with a lot of dreams . She once knew how to fly . But she 's forgotten now . So , what did you do before you starting volunteering for tests ? I 'm a photographer . I bet you 're good at it ! Now , they say there two kinds of work a man can do . The kind he enjoys and the kind he does best . The two are the same , he truly is blessed . Take care , Katherine . Do you want a ride home ? Sure ! Well , then , what 's someone like you doing taking these tests ? What 's someone like you doing giving them ? We 're practically neighbors , I 'm just a few blocks away . We chose this place because it 's so close to Scott 's school . Scott ? My son . Is there a Mrs Forrester ? No . - Thank you . - You 're welcome ! - Bye . - Bye , bye ! You got a ride home ! Yes . So , who is she ? She 's from the university . The one that 's been ... giving you the tests ? Yes . How have they been going ? You haven 't been saying anything weird , have you ? They went fine . Then why did she drive you home ? I think she needed a friend . When do you turn this in ? Oh , tomorrow . The Science Institute is doing the judging . It looks fine but , ermm ... it 's not complete . What do you mean ? Well , it 's missing some satellites . What ? You kidding , right ? I got ... I followed the diagram right out of the book . There 's one here . And here . And here . Are you sure ? Yeah ... I 'm sure . Katherine ? Hi . I haven 't been in this office for almost a year . Strange , they haven 't changed a thing . It 's like stepping back in time . There is so much to learn . So much we don 't understand . Andrew Bradford ? Is that your husband ? Was . He died a year ago in a car accident . I 'm sorry . Thank you , but I finished grieving a long time ago . Katherine , what happened ? If you belong here , why did you leave ? Andrew and I came here right out of college . We were newly-weds . Our heads full of big dreams . Right away , we joined the team of scientists working on the Odyssey Two . The probe sent out to explore the Solar System ? Hmm . It was an exciting time for all of us . Planets we 'd only seen through telescopes and and artists ' imaginations , we were finally seeing up close for the first time . Then about two years ago , after it passed Uranus , we lost track of it . - It ran out of power . - Hmm . So , the government sanctioned a follow-up mission . We were going back to the planets . Only this time with the latest in technology . Andrew and I ... developed a new time of image enhancer . We 'd give it sharper photographs to our colors . All of a sudden , grant money starting pouring in . And then , Andrew died . It took a while , but I finally came back to the project . Then , one night . I was going through Andrew 's files , and I found a report that he had written . detailing our progress and the research we had done . It was for the Pentagon . Pentagon ? The image enhancer would be used in a military spy satellite . And Andrew knew it . Dean Willet knew it . But they never told me . I thought I knew him . We had dedicated out lives to the peaceful exploration of space . When the government came calling , Andrew sold out . Wendy , hmmm , there are two people scheduled for testing this afternoon . Could you call and cancel them ? Yes . Thanks . Hi . Hi . What 's this ? The money from the tests . Four hours , one hundred dollars . I figured that mail would take several days so , I thought I 'd deliver it myself . Thank you . Well ... Yeah . Well ... Thanks . Look , I know it 's early but have you been outside yet today ? Yes , yes , I have . It 's a nice day , isn 't it ? Yes . It 's very nice . I mean , this time of year , it 's beautiful . Very beautiful . Look , you wouldn 't wanna go for a walk with me , would you ? You know ? Kick some leaves around , have some hot chocolate ? I 'd understand if you 'd already had something planned . I would love to kick leaves with you , Katherine . So , when you were a kid , what did you wanna be when you grew up ? When I was a kid ? Yeah , didn 't you have any big dreams ? You know ? Were you gonna be a doctor ? A lawyer ? A Senator , maybe ? I wanted to be a pilot . A pilot . Yeah . Wouldn 't it be great to just take off in the wide , blue , yonder and leave all of this behind ? More wonderful than you know . You know , my dreams weren 't too different . I wanted to soar among the stars but I wanted to do it from down here . The great , big universe out there just waiting to be explored . We 're not doing a damned thing about it . What about the Odyssey Three ? They want you to finish your work on your image enhancer . Yes , they even sent a guy from the Pentagon to try and convince me . Why don 't you do it ? Cos it 's financed by the military . Is that so bad ? Don 't tell me you 're on their side . I don 't take sides . Well , you should ! We ... We have to take a stand ! What 's the point of being a scientist and making new discoveries if it 'll only be used by the military for destruction ? The same discoveries you used for good . Yesterday at the Psy-Club , when I was showing you all those pictures , I showed you something that was sad or angry , and ... you only saw the beauty and the hope . And when you ... touched my hand ... and looked at me , I felt as if you were looking right inside me . You 're a very special man , Paul Forrester . Scott ! Come here a minute ! I want you to meet Katherine Bradford . - This is my son , Scott . - Hi . Hi . Is he shy ? No . He saw us kiss . I think so . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . That wasn 't very friendly , Scott . You 're falling in love with her , aren 't you ? I don 't know . I think maybe that 's what I 'm feeling . Dad , you can 't fall ... Love is the most wonderful part of being a human . It 's also the hardest part to understand about it . - Dad ... - I know it is wrong . I know Fox will catch up to us someday and we 'll have to leave . But I don 't think I can help it . I think this is one of the best . Such a charming boy who turned it in too . I 'd like to see the entry form on this project . Now . Scott Hayden ? Yeah ? I 'm doctor Dan Willet . This is Major Holmes . Please , have a seat . Huh ! This is pretty royal treatment . I didn 't think the winners would be announced til next week ! Is this your project ? These communication satellites ? Yeah . Son , where did you get the information for this ? Where did you get the information for this ? I read about it ... in a book . Well , you obviously have gone through a lot of trouble to be very accurate , Scott . You 've labelled some of the satellites ... A few of which you couldn 't have read out of a book . Well , ah ... I got most of it from the book and , I figured , you know , we 've probably come a long way since the book was printed so I just kind of threw in a few . Tell me , son . Who worked with you on this ? Nobody ! I told you , I 'm just a kid . I made it up . We 're gonna have to call his parents in . Is your mother at home ? He only has a father listed . Paul Forrester . Paul Forrester ... Forrester ... wait a minute . Could you get me Katherine Bradford on the line , please ? Scott ! You two know each other ? Yes . What 's wrong ? Will you excuse us for a moment , Major ? I 'd like to talk to these two alone . Thank you . This is the boy 's science project . He says he got the information from a book and he made up the rest . But of course , we know differently , don 't we ? We do ? You may not wanna work on the program , Katherine but you just don 't casually give out classified information to a high school student ! Now , do you know what kind of trouble you 'd get in , if he ever found out about this ? Hmm ? You 're right ! You are absolutely right . It was just a school project . I wasn 't thinking . Damn right , you weren 't thinking ! Alright . Scott , you can go . I 'm sorry but ... we 're gonna have to disqualify your entry from the Fair . That 's OK . It 's no problem , really . Thanks . Look , I 'm sorry I got you in trouble back there . Thanks for getting me off the hook . It 's alright . Where did you get the information ? Like I said , I just made it up . That 's impossible . It 's much too accurate . Did your father help you ? Him ? Ha ! Why would he know about stuff like that ? Scott , would you and your father like to come to my house for dinner tonight ? - Erm ... - I 'm a very good cook ! I don 't know . When was the last time you had a home-cooked meal ? I can 't remember . Then we sent two space-crafts to Jupiter 's moon Io . We saw things beyond our imagination . All continents looked different in just four months ' time . - The surface changes that rapidly ? - Yeah . Oh , if you lived on Io , you wouldn 't get a weather report , you 'd get a geology report . " There 's a new island on the South Eastern Sea today ... " " New eruptions due to mountain building in the East ... " I didn 't know you were an astronomy puff . No , I ... I 've spent a few hours watching the stars . So , what happened to Odyssey Two ? We think its sun sensor lost track of the Sun . Sun sensor ? Come on , I 'll show you . This is Andrew 's den . I keep meaning to throw all this stuff away , but I never seem to get around to it . Odyssey Two ! See , the antenna transmit a beam so we can hear it . But if it tumbles the sun sensor , here ... points away from the Sun , it runs out of power . So , it 's just floating in space ... Dead to the world . Where was it when you last had contact ? On its way to Neptune . Would 've been our first encounter with that planet . Boy ! That would 've been something . But if you go back to work on the Odyssey Three ... You can still reach Neptune someday . Why is it so important that I go back to the project ? It just seems like you 'd be happier there . Happier ? I 've been happier in the last couple of days than I 've been in a long time . I didn 't realize how late it was . I have a test tomorrow so I should really go and study for it . Come on , Dad . Let 's go . Dad ? It 's a great kid you got there ! He 's sweet ! And smart ! Now , it 's nice to see such an avid interest in science at such an early age . What are you doing ? [ LOOKING THROUGH YOUR TAPES ! ] Good idea ! [ BEEPING NOISES AND PEOPLE CHEERING ] You knew what this was , didn 't you ? Yes ! I thought you 'd wanna hear it ! Well , you were wrong . It was really like that , you know ? A room full of ... mature scientists screaming and yelling like a bunch of kids . Being blown away by what we were hearing . Stay with me tonight , Paul . I need you . I can 't stay with you , Katherine . Why not ? I didn 't mean for us to get this close . It shouldn 't have happened . I 'm not who you think I am . What is that supposed to mean ? I was right ! You did give Scott that classified information . From the very beginning ! Everything you 've said ! Everything you 've done ! All that talk about discoveries being used for good . It was all to get me back in the project , wasn 't it ? First , they sent Major Holmes and then you . My God ! How you use and manipulate people . - Now , wait a minute ! - And I thought ... I really believed . - Katherine ! No , wait now , wait a minute ! - Don 't touch me ! How could you ? Get out of here ! Just get on the phone ! Call Washington and tell them to get that ... - Just pick the phone and call Washington ... - Katherine ! - And tell them to get him off my back ! Will you please settle down ? I told you ! I didn 't know anything about this ! - You would do anything to get that grant . - Come on ! You know this is more than just money . Have you lost sight of the work we 're doing here ? That image enhancer you designed ... It 's a wonder toy for the military to exploit ! Katherine , you wrote the spin-off report , You know that anything we develop has civilian side benefits , applications in other fields . You know ? Yesterday ... Yesterday I might have been ready to listen . But not now . I 've been set up one too many times . I can 't do it anymore . I 'm sorry , Dan . I 'm leaving the university . [ OH , HI , DAN , HOW ARE YOU ? ] [ NICE TRY , JIM . KATHERINE KNOWS WHO HE IS . YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL HIM OFF ] Call who off ? Come on ! You know what I 'm talking about ! The guy you sent in to change her perspective on things . What guy ? Paul Forrester ! Hold on a second , Dan . - Hey , Mark ! - Yeah ? Do we have an agent named Paul Forrester ? Hmm , I 'll check . Paul Forrester ... No . But the name seems to raise a flag on the Federal Security Agency . The FSA ? Yeah , here it is : " Classified " . Contact Special Agent George Fox . I can 't believe it . She thinks you 're from the Pentagon ? Yeah , they 've sent people before to try to talk her into going back to her work for the government . She thinks I 'm one of them . That all this was set up ? Yeah . What are you gonna do ? Nothing . Nothing ? Well , we 'll have to move on soon . I wouldn 't be able to tell her why . At least now , she 's angry with me instead of being hurt . Maybe it 's better this way . Better let her think that you lied to her all this time ? You can 't do that ! I have no choice . Dad ! It may hurt her ... when she finds out that you have go . But believe me , that 's nothing compared to what she 's feeling right now . Yes , I 'd like to know if flight 126 to Denver is departing on time ? Thank you . Edna , will you get a car for me right away , please ? Yes , Captain , I 'm here . That 's right ! Forrester , Paul Forrester . Captain , he 's likely to be travelling with a boy , his son whose name is Scott Hayden . That 's right . Now , there 's also one other thing I 'd like to ask you to do for me ... I 'd like a full ... surveillance on a professor at the Science Institute . No , no , actually , it 's a woman ... Doc Bradford . Katherine Bradford ? Right , she 's likely to be our lead . And you will have a unit pick me up at the airport ? My flight leaves in half and hour . Right . I gotta go . No , no ! Can we talk about that when I get there ? OK , thank you . Bye . Katherine , wait ! Where are you going ? Away ! Just leave me alone ! Please , don 't go ! I gotta talk to you . About what ? You wanna tell me the details about how you tried to set me up ? No thanks ! You don 't understand . I 'm not from Washington . Nobody sent me to talk to you ! Well , then , who are you ? I wanna explain . But not here . Why are the police after you ? What did you do ? I didn 't do anything , Katherine ! There 's something that I have to show you . Please . I thought you were gonna tell me who you are ! I am ! I 'm gonna show you as soon as it 's dark . What are we doing here ? What are you doing ? Is this how you operate the telescope ? Yes . Have you talked to the neighbors ? Has anybody done any ? Have you talked to each other ? She 's not at her house ? She 's not at the Science Institute ? The woman has vanished off the face of the Earth ! We watched every door to this house ! There 's been no-one in or out . Look , all I asked for was a simple surveillance until I got out here ! Was that so incredibly difficult ? What is that thing ? It 's a part of who I am . And this is where I 'm from . That 's not possible . Yes , it is . You were a map-maker ? Of the stars ? Yes . Then , why did you come back here ? Because my son needed me . There was no-one to help him . So much about you makes sense to me now . I have dreamed my whole life ... for a moment like this . Of meeting somebody like you . There are so many questions I wanna ask . I 'm not sure you 'd understand the answers . Stay with me , Paul . You and Scott . We can help each other . And there 's so much you can teach me ! You 'd be safe . I 'd make sure that they didn 't find you . I can 't stay , Katherine . You know that . Then , let me come with you . You have to stay here . There 's important work for you to do . You can 't leave it unfinished . I 'm learning everyday , Katherine ... About things ... About people ... D 'you want me to tell you what I 've learn from you ? Yes . The human beings are endlessly creative . They 're always looking for ... new ways to do this ... new ideas . That 's what makes you so special ... and unique . If you lose that , you won 't survive . There will always be people ... who will abuse knowledge . We can 't let that stop us from discovering , can we ? Dad ! Can I talk to you ? Privately ? It 's alright . She knows . The police have got Katherine 's place staked out . Cops are everywhere and Fox is with them . I got our stuff outside . We have to go . I 'll help ! We can take my car . No , they 'll be looking for that . We gotta do this on our own . Alright . But I know another way out of here . The road goes back over the mountain and ends up in the next County . - Great , let 's go . - Wait . - Dad , we gotta get out of here ! - I gotta do this first . What 's a five-letter word for " extraterrestrial " ? Good God . That 's Odyssey Two . Dad , we have to go . Don 't ever stop ... discovering ... and learning . I promise . Good-bye , Katherine . Good-bye . Mystery man . Two years without a peep and then , suddenly , it starts up again just like that . The sun sensor must have found its source . And somehow that created enough energy to get it going again . Is that how it happened ? - Are we still on course ? - Yes . It 's spooky ... almost like it were flying itself all along . Well , perhaps it was only waiting until it had something new to show us . Everything it shows us from now on will be a new discovery . Doctor Bradford , congratulations . Odyssey Two is truly a remarkable achievement . Thank you , Mr Fox . But the credit belongs to a lot of people . Not just me . I understand . Believe me , I understand . Sorry we had to leave , Dad . She was a terrific lady . Yeah , she was . You think we 'll ever get to settle down ? Be a real family ? I don 't know . You still haven 't told me how you found us ! I used the sphere ! Come on , little Scott . I still got a lot to learn , though . Don 't we all ? Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * *

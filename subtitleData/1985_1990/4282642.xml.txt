 Abandon ship ! Abandon ship ! Black hole approaching . This is not a drill . THIS is a drill ... Abandon ship ! Oh , God ! Now the siren 's bust . Awooga ! Awooga ! Abandon ship ! But a black hole is a huge , impacted star . It 's millions of miles wide . Why didn 't you see anything ? Well , the thing about a black hole , its main distinguishing feature is it 's black . And the thing about space , the colour of space , your basic space colour ... is it 's black . - How are you supposed to see them ? - But five . How can you be ambushed by five black holes ? Always the way , innit ? You wait three million years and not one , then , suddenly , five turn up at once . Come on . We 've only got 20 minutes . - Careful . Don 't knock it . - What did you bring this junk for ? That " junk " happens to be a Javanese camphor-wood chest . It was my father 's and has my valuables in it . I never knew you had so much crap . What 's this ? Toy soldiers ? " Toy soldiers " ? They 've been in our family for years . They 're priceless replicas of Napoleon 's Armee du Nord . So you can 't change the clothes like you can with Sindy ? - Look , we 've got barely 15 minutes . - What the smeg is this ? ! Just what little I 've managed to scrimp and scrape for a rainy day . - There must be 20 grand here . - 24 . Look , let 's get off the ship . 24,000 ? And you had the front to borrow money off me to buy ME a birthday present ! That 's going back a bit . It was only 15 quid . Right , 15 quid . And what did I get ? A five-quid book token . Those cards aren 't free . I had to fork out for that . You never even paid me back . You 're tighter than an Italian waiter 's keks . Blue Midget is loaded . - Aren 't you ready ? - We 'll catch you up . - Have you got everything ? - Just the bare essentials . I have the bare essentials , too - 36 outfits and ten full-length dress mirrors . Cat , we 're going to be away for 12 hours . - You think I need more mirrors ? - Let 's get out of here . Go , go , go ! - I want a safe drive . No stunts . - No worries . OK , I 'll navigate Red Dwarf through the black holes . If all goes well , we 'll rendezvous on Sigma 14D . What if all doesn 't go well ? Red Dwarf will be crushed to the size of a garden pea . Bye-bye , Birdseye . - Please . They 're priceless . - I 'm only having a goosie . If you get curry over them , how will that look ? What would Baron Jaquinaux of the First Cavalry Division be doing with meat vindaloo all over his tunic ? It 'll make him look more authentic . People 'll think he 's got dysentery . You 're obsessed with war , aren 't you ? You collect toy soldiers . You play war games . You read those stupid combat magazines . Half your books are about Patton and Caesar and various other gits . It 's about leadership . That 's what I admire . It 's just so ironic when , deep down , you 're such a natural coward . - Coward ? ! - Planet leave . Miranda . That space bar . Remember that ? When that fight started , you were gone quicker than a whippet with a bumful of dynamite . That was a bar room brawl , a common pub fight , a shambolic drunken set-to . Which you started . I just made an innocuous comment . I merely voiced the rumour that MacWilliams was sexually tilted in favour of sleeping with the dead . I didn 't start the rumour . I merely voiced it . To his face . Right to his face . When he was with his four biggest mates . Then you do a Roadrunner and leave me to face the music . - I could 've got hurt . - You 'd make a brilliant general . Generals don 't smash chairs over people 's heads . They don 't stick Newcastle Brown bottles in your face and say , " Stitch that , Jimmy . " Generals are in a tent on the hill , sipping Sancerre , directing the battle . - They 're men of honour . - You make war sound romantic . I 'll tell you something , something I 've never told anyone . When I was 15 , I went on a trip to Macedonia to Alexander the Great 's palace . And for the first time in my whole life , I felt I was home . This palace was where I belonged . Years later , I got friendly with a hypnotherapist , Donald . I told him about it . He said he could regress me back to past lives . I was dubious , but I let him do it . It turned out my instincts were absolutely correct . I had lived a past life in Macedonia . That palace WAS my home . Because , Lister , believe it or not , he told me that in a previous incarnation , I was Alexander the Great 's chief eunuch . Do you know something ? I believe you . He didn 't say I was Alexander the Great himself , which is what I wanted to hear , but it explained everything . I 'd lived alongside one of the greatest generals in history . - No wonder the military is in my blood . - No wonder you 're a good singer . Well , maybe it 's tot , but even to this day , I can 't look at a pair of nutcrackers without wincing . And whenever I 'm with a group of women , I have this overwhelming urge to bathe them in warm olive oil . Rimmer , I have that urge . It 's got nothing to do with past lives . - Well , why is it , then ? - It 's because you 're unhappy . You 're unhappy with your own boring , humdrum , weaselly existence . You 're looking for something with a bit more - I don 't know - glamour . Now is what counts , Rimmer , living for today . Who knows what 'll happen tomorrow ? That 's what makes life so exciting . Mayday . Mayday . Can you read me ? Come in , please . Can you read me ? Still snowing , is it ? It 's useless . You can hardly stand up , never mind dig it out . - No luck ? - Nothing 's getting through . Three days . They must be looking for us by now . Where the smeg are they ? In this weather , they could be ten feet away and walk past us . We 're going to die , aren 't we ? How much food is there ? There 's half a bag of soggy smoky bacon crisps , a tin of mustard powder , three water biscuits , a brown lemon , two bottles of vinegar and a tube of Bonjela gum ointment . - Gum ointment ? - It was in the first-aid box . It 's that minty flavour . It 's quite nice . It 's quite nice smeared on your mouth ulcer . - You can 't eat it . - You may have to . - That 's it ? There 's nothing else ? - Just a Pot Noodle ... Oh , and some dog food in the tool cupboard . Well , it 's obvious what gets eaten last . I can 't stand Pot Noodles . We 're going to die , aren 't we ? Correction , I 'M going to die . You 're already dead . You don 't need food . - Did you find any wood ? - There 's no wood out there . There 's no vegetation out there . Smeg all . Just a wasteland . You 've got to keep this fire going . I 'm going to die , aren 't I ? God , I 'm hungry . I 'm having the crisps . - No . - Just one . You ate less than 16 hours ago . I had a raw sprout and that chewing gum I found under the desk ! You 've got to pace yourself . Go to sleep . Wait till tomorrow . It 's OK for you . You don 't need food . You don 't even feel the cold . Think of something else . Try to take your mind off it . Mayday . Mayday . - I wonder they call it " Mayday " ? - Eh ? The distress call . Why " Mayday " ? It 's only a bank holiday . Why not Shrove Tuesday or Ascension Sunday ? Ascension Sunday . Ascension Sunday . The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost . The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost . It 's French , you doink . " M 'aidez . " " Help me . " - M-aid-ez . - Is that right ? Everywhere I look reminds me of food . Look at these books - Charles Lamb ... Herman Wok ... the complete works of Sir Francis Bacon ... Eric Van Lustbader ... Eric Van Lustbader ? What 's he got to do with food ? Van . Bread van . Meat van . Food ! Look , you 're getting obsessed . It 's these books . It 's like they 're here to taunt me . Look at this , " The Caretaker " by Harold Pint-er . It 's Pinter . - Stop thinking about food . - Take my mind off it . - Talk to me about something . - What ? - Anything . - Erm ... - Anything apart from food ? - Don 't talk about food . - I can 't think of another topic . - Don 't mention Topics . They 're food ! - Tell me a story . Any story . - I don 't know any stories . - Tell me how you lost your virginity . - My what ? - Talk to me . - How I lost it ? Well , it was so long ago . I was so young and sexually precocious , I 'm not sure I can remember . Everyone remembers that . It 's just one of those things . Like everyone remembers where they were when Cliff Richard was shot ... or when the first woman landed on Pluto , or when they put a gigantic toupee over the Earth to cover the gap in the ozone layer . It 's just one of those things you always remember . Well , I don 't . You can hardly expect me to recall every sexual liaison I 've ever had . - What am I , the Memory Man ? - Rimmer , I want the truth . - The truth ? - Yeah . Not much to tell , really . I was always a fish out of water around women . Never know what to say to them . I wasn 't very highly sexed , to be honest with you . I think it was all that cabbage I was forced to eat as a boy . Still , the first time ... The first time was this girl I met at cadet school , Sandra . We did it in my brother 's car . - What was it like ? - Brilliant . Incredible . Bentley V8 convertible . Walnut panelling . Marvellous machine . Marvellous . - So , how did you lose yours ? - Michelle Fisher . The ninth hole of the Bootle municipal golf course . Par four , dog-leg to the right , in the bunker . You lost your virginity on a golf course ? How did you have the nerve ? It wasn 't during the Ryder Cup or anything . It was midnight . - How old were you ? - She was so good-looking . She could have got a job working on the perfume counter at Lewis 's . - How old were you ? - She just stood there completely naked . I was so excited , I nearly dropped my skateboard . - Skateboard ? ! How old were you ? - Twelve . Twelve ? ! Twelve years old ? ! You lost your virginity when you were twelve ? ! Twelve ? ! You can 't have been a full member of the golf club . Of course I wasn 't ! You did it on a golf course and you weren 't a member ? ! - Of course I wasn 't . - You didn 't pay green fees ? It was just a place to go . I used to play golf . I hate people who abuse the facilities . I hope you raked the sand back nicely before you left . That 'd be some lie to get into . Competition the next day , your ball lands in Lister 's buttock crevice . You 'd need more than a niblick to get that out . - Are you saying I 've got a big bum ? - Big ? It 's like two badly parked Volkswagens . All I ever lost when I was 12 were my shoes with the compass in the heel and animal-track soles . Porky Roebuck threw them in the septic tank behind the sports ground . I cried for weeks . I was wearing them . I never even thought about sex when I was 12 . Maybe that 's because you were Alexander the Great 's chief eunuch . - What are you doing ? - There 's nothing left to burn . - Don 't burn my books ! - There 's nothing else left . But it 's obscene . A book is a thing of beauty . The voice of freedom , the essence of civilisation . " Biggles Learns to Fly " ? Well , perhaps not that one . " The Complete Works of Shakespeare . " This 'll be good for a few hours . Three days without food , and civilisation comes tumbling down . What are you on about ? They say that any society is three meals away from revolution . Deprive a culture of food for three meals and you 'll have anarchy . It 's true . You 've gone without food for two days and become a barbarian . - I 'm just burning a book . - It 's not just a book . It 's the only copy of the greatest work in English literature . Probably the only copy left in the universe , and you 'd chuck it on the fire to keep warm for 15 minutes . There 's nothing left to burn . That 's it , then , is it ? Toodle-pip , King Lear . Farewell , Macbeth . Bye-bye , Hamlet . Have you ever actually read any of it ? I 've seen " West Side Story " . That 's based on one . Have you actually read any of it ? Not all the way through , no . - But I can quote some . - Go on , then . " Now ... " That 's all I can remember . - What 's that from ? - " Richard III " , you moron . The brilliant " now " speech he does . " Now ... something , something . " It 's brilliant . Unforgettable . I 'll save it till last . Is it OK if I burn " Lolita " ? Save page 61 . - That bit . - That 's disgusting . You can take that look off your face . - I 'm just trying to stay alive . - You 're eating dog food . Yeah . I haven 't eaten for six days . I 'm eating dog food . I 'm sure the dog food will be lovely . This isn 't dog food . It 's a prime fillet steak in blue cheese sauce . It 's been charcoal-broiled in garlic and is going to taste delicious . Delicious ... Delicious ... Well , now I know why dogs lick their testicles . It 's to take away the taste of the food . The stove 's getting low . Better throw another book on . - That 's the last . - You 've burnt all of them ? When we get to Act Five of " Henry VIII " , I 'm a dead man . There must be something else to burn . Not the trunk . It 's Javanese camphor wood . It 's priceless . There 's only the trunk and what 's inside . Wait a minute ! Not Napoleon 's Armee du Nord . Rimmer , get real , man . What 's important ? If it burns , we burn it . What 's the least valuable ? Not the trunk . My father gave me that . - The soldiers , then . - They 're 19th-century . Irreplaceable . They were hand-carved by the legendary Dubois brothers . Well , then ? Better start unpacking the soldiers . No . There must be something else to burn . There must be . There isn 't . I looked . Look , I know it must be a bummer . I know it must be heartbreaking , but it 's just stuff . It 's just possessions . They 're only things . In the end , they 're not important . They might go for a bundle in some swanky Islington antique shop , but right here and now , all they are is nicely painted firewood . This isn 't happening . It 's a nightmare . You 've got to get your priorities right . It 's like people who run back into a burning house to rescue some piece of furniture and wind up burning to death . Nothing 's more important than a human life ... - What about your guitar ? - .. except my guitar . Why didn 't we think of it before ? We 'll burn your guitar . - Not my guitar . - It 's made of wood . Yeah , but it 's my guitar . I 've had it since I was 16 . That is an authentic Les Paul copy . But it 's not worth anything . It 's just a thing , a possession . - Yeah , but it 's mine . - How is it different from MY soldiers ? That 's my lifeline . I need that guitar . I mean , when it gets to me ... I mean , the loneliness and all that ... When it gets on top of me , it 's my only means of escape . I know I 'm not exactly a wizard on it . I know it 's only got five strings and three of them are G ... but I 've never had anything to cling onto - no roots , no parents , no education ... - No education ? - I went to art college . All I 've ever had is that guitar . It 's the only thing in my whole life that hasn 't walked out on me . Don 't make me burn it . We 've got to . Look , I know this might sound stupid , like , but ... can I just play one song on it , just one for the road ? Sure , sure . I mean , I 'm not enjoying this . I know , man . Thanks . # She 's out of my life # I don 't know whether to laugh or cry ... # My step-dad taught me this one . It 's the first song I ever learned to play . - I 'm just going to , er ... - # I don 't know whether to live or die # She 's out of my ... # Life # - I don 't know what to say . - There 's nothing to say . You 've made a supreme sacrifice . You know that ? - A supreme sacrifice . - It had to be done . I 've been judging the book by its cover , haven 't I ? All these years , that 's what I 've been doing . When it comes down to it , you 're one regular guy . Don 't be modest . I know what that guitar meant to you . It means exactly the same as that trunk means to me . If that trunk got so much as scratched , I would be devastated . It 's not the outward value . To me , that trunk is a link to the past , to the father I never squared things with ... - Is it ? - That trunk is all he ever gave me , apart from ... apart from his disappointment . You 've shown me , by burning your guitar , what true value is . Decency . Self-sacrifice . Those are the things that make up real wealth , and from where I 'm standing , I 'm a pretty rich man . - Oh , God . - Burn the soldiers . - Not the soldiers , as well . - I want to make a sacrifice , too . Burn the Armee du Nord . Cast them to the flames . Let them lay down their lives for the sake of friendship . - What 's that smell ? - What smell ? I can 't smell any smell . Camphor wood . Your guitar was made of camphor wood . It must have been worth a fortune . Burn the soldiers right now . Look , there they are . Mush ! Mush ! Au revoir , mes amis . A bientot . Rimmer , there 's something I 've got to tell you , something awful . If it 's about finishing off the dog food , I understand . - No , it 's not about that ... - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Oooooow ! - Cat ! Kryten ! - We made it ! - Food ! You brought food ! - So , where have you been ? We rendezvoused with Holly . When you didn 't show up , - I said we should look for you . - We 've been everywhere . Fourteen moons , two planets . I 've been so worried , I haven 't buffed my shoes for days . So , Holly navigated through five black holes ? As it transpired , there weren 't any black holes . - They were on the monitor . - They weren 't black holes . - What were they ? - Grit . Five specks of grit on the scanner-scope . See , the thing about grit is it 's black , and the thing about scanner-scopes ... - Oh , shut up . - Let 's go . Something happened here , Kryten . Something that made us closer . I saw a side of Dave Lister that I never knew existed . He 's not an irresponsible , selfish drifter , always out for number one . He 's a man . A man of honour . Excuse me . Open the trunk . Kryten , get the hacksaw and follow me . Where are we going ? We 're going to do to Lister what Alexander the Great once did to me . # It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

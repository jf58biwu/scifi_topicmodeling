 ya know . I gotta get a permit from ' em just to open this floor up . They say a guy got lost in here back in ' 37 . Just disappeared when he was loading some stuff in . huh ? The only thing I wanna know is what on this floor is pulling all that juice . you know ? He says we don 't mess around with anything . Gomez . You got a big conservation problem here . You hear something ? Gomez . ( spanish ) What the heck was that ? I don 't know . We shoulda called the estate . Frozen solid . A regular rat-sicle . What do you suppose it is ? A refrigerator of some kind . Ameliaaa ! Aaaah ! Blinding me with science ! Science ! Science Mm mm mmm I can hear machinery blinding me with science science ! Science ! Sci-sci-science It 's poetry in motion And now she 's making love to me . The spheres 're in commotion The elements in harmony She blinded me with science She blinded me with science And hit me with technology hup hup hup hup Science ! Good heavens Miss Sakamoto You 're beautiful I don 't believe it ! There she goes again ! and I can 't find anything ! All my tubes and wires and careful notes ! Antiquated notions let 's go . let 's get it out here . El Be careful with all that stuff now . Billy Ah now - El . There 's garbage in our driveway ! just relax . We get all the luck and now there 's garbage . Get the garbage out of here . Howdy . don 't ya ? Not Funny . Easy . Easy does it . Come on . There we go . You guys monitor his vitals ? Couldn 't get near ' em . He froze every instrument we had . Contact temperature transference . Haven 't seen that in awhile . Let 's get him inside . come on . the scanner 's workin ' right ? Billy . Momquist put somebody on it . Okay this is great . We have a walking popsicle here . Watch the - Ah it came out . Nothing ever works around here . His name 's Arnold Biefneiter . Niefbeiter ? Biefneiter . Born in Kansas City in 1900 . No Living Relatives . The guy barely looks forty . Billy . That machine froze the poor boy like a pork chop . speaking of which right ? The machine was built for Howard Hubert in 1935 . but they were unable to get the apparatus to work . Until Biefneiter here tried it out at Bemins . Am I supposed to read that as a no ? Okay let 's get him up on the table . alright ? Dr. Hayes . You have some messages . let me have that insulation blanket . give me a clamp . and still rising . Alright . How long has he been out of the deep freeze ? About two hours . And he was weak when we found him . Cardiovascular 's failing . Wisconsin called . Her son Randy 's been breathing fire and she 's scared about losing the house . someone hit the power switch on this scanner . I really don 't think it 's fair ya know ? Body temperature 's rising up to twenty eight degrees . and is it my fault Francois Lost the reservations ? no . please ? called again . He said he 's been in to see you six times but you treat ' im like he 's not even here . We 're losing ' im I 'm getting ventricular fibrillation Hit the juice " . Weren 't we supposed to get this fixed last week ? Budget cuts . Body temperature 's up to twenty-nine degrees . and your mother called from her beauty salon . He 's arresting . No he 's not . He 's melting . Walking popsicle . Open the freezer . Whoa ! empty it out . Take out the shelf . Come on ! Yeah . Anything you say . let 's get the blanket off . we 're gonna tip him into the freezer . let 's move the gurney up . Right there . Okay lock up your wheel . on three we 'll do it . Ready ? One ... Two ... Three ! Okay . Alright . Lock the door . Watch the wires . Watch the cord . Twenty eight degrees . Twenty seven . CV stabilizing . Miss Nance . Where was my mother calling from ? Where 'd she go ? Lunch ! Yes . It sends chills up my spine . one more time . Mom . Mom . I happen to like my car . I do ! I gue - Yes dented fenders or no dented fenders . I - Well I happen to think a ' 65 Dart has it has - it has charm . but that doesn 't mean - mom . Mom ! will you stop and listen to - Will you stop - Will you stop and listen to me ? Will you listen ? I don 't care what Jimmy Havenstock drives mom . I really don - Okay . Mom . I am . Mom . I - But I 've gotta get going . El 's - okay ? I love you . Say hello to Dad . bye . And wanted to know why her son wasn 't ... a yuppie . El. we got some problems here . You 're a man with a gift for understatement . this is important stuff here . Beef could - Beef here could be a new breakthrough . And how are we treated ? and a salary that could make a paperboy cry . Exactly . the problem here is results . Plain and simple . Strickland wants results . Got that ? Okay . Results . He wants results . I 'll show you results . okay ? Right . Or how about your glandular research over here huh ? I mean look at this . Big Bunny . Little bunny . look . I mean come on . This isn 't progress ? it isn 't human . when Momquist was running this place okay ? He 's a man of science . He understands bunnies . Okay ? He wants stuff that 's commercial . Stuff that turns a profit . Stuff that has to do with - War . Right . El . That 's it . what does her think we do around here anyway. huh ? Strickland wants war . He 's gonna get it . You are asking Congress to approve the construction of the most destructive weapon in the world . You betcha . If you could see what this baby can do . the Neutron Beam will have enormous destructive potential . Senator . No radiation . No fallout . Which makes it doubly dangerous . It 's a weapon that could be tempting to use . that you in the military are going to have a responsible - and safe - place to keep it . Senator . The NB bunker is located at a secret site about three hours from here . Now the only way into the chamber in which the Beam will be stored is through a defense corridor which is virtually impassable . And the pentagon is ready to throw everything it 's got against that defense system to prove it . Excuse me . I think that before we go any further we should inform the senators of the dangers we 've encountered in the computer simulations . Dr. Momquist . ( Whispers ) Sit down . my distinguished predecessor is a scientist of great precaution . the computers indicate that there are some bugs in the Beam that still need to be worked out . But that 's the way it always is with these kind of breakthroughs . everything starts out with bugs in the military . You boys know that . ( Scattered laugh ) Whoa ! Big Guns . Dr. Momquist . Billy . I 'm a little busy just now . Um . You 're a little busy right now . I 'll just come back later and we can talk about it alone . Fine Dr. Hayes . right ? Doctor ? um ... Our lips are sealed . that 's - Secret project ? one of the little things that we 're working on with a lot of commercial potential . The kind of stuff that can turn big profit . General . if you don 't get out that door ... Strickland . but it 's time to do a little groveling . an army of soldiers that can actually see in the dark . Huh ? We 're working on it . Imagine fighting men who can grow to be ... ten feet tall . Huh ? We 're working on that too . think about jet pilots whose reflexes are as fast as that of a computer 's . huh ? right ? Well we are . At H-I-T . And at H.I.T. We do more of it Than anyone else in the world . Pretty good . Dr. Hayes ? H.I.T 's ... . hit the fan . easy . Eaaasy does it . Aaaah ! pal . nice and Easy . be cool . Aaargh ! Holy Scanner . Whoa ! Aaargh ! Holy - Where 'd everybody go ? Ameliaaaa ! There were some calls while you were out . What 's going on down here ? It 's freezing ! Argh ! no ! Cripes ! how 'd he get out ? he broke the door wide open . The cold seems to recharge his strength . Ameliaaaaa ! He keeps calling for " Amelia First call was from a man who says he sprouts fish scales everytime he goes swimming . Who is he ? He didn 't leave his name . He 's a cryogenic guy we got this morning . He freezes everything he touches . wait a minute . What year was he frozen ? Thirty seven . July . Ameliaaa ! Earheat . What ? That was the year Amelia Earhart disappeared . Maybe that 's the only thing he remembers . Your landlord called at 2 : 15 to say your check bounced . My bunnies . Ohh . Biefneiter . Okay ? These bunnies are mine . man ! He 'll freeze ya . Aaarrgh ! Biefneiter . Beef . Listen to me . Ameliaaaa ! don 't - Whoa see the door ? Look at the door . See the generals ? they 're trying to find Amelia . I mean - And they 're trying really hard . And if anyone 's gonna find ' em it 's them . Beef . Okay ? Trust me on this . Okay . What do you think El ? huh ? No ! huh ? huh ? Beef ? Ummmm . Piece O ' Cake . General : Now that was one whale of a display of destruction . You say he was cryogenically frozen ? Billy : We like to think of him as a giant Popsicle . two or thee hours at nomal temperatures and he melts . you just throw him back in the fridge . And he can freeze anything he touches ? We call it " contact temperature transference . CTT The military applications are tremendous . Imagine . Freezing an enemy harbor . The whole black sea ! Huh ! okay ? you know ? you have him freeze a whole harbor - or even a small lake or something - and you could drive his temperature up enough to ya know ? yeah Hayes . Take him to the level one lab in the military bunker . wai - hey wait a minute Dr. S. You 're not serious are you ? you can 't give him to the military division . D-Dr . Mom . He and El are more experienced . I 'm not interested in their experience Momquist . Something in this program finally stands a chance to make a profit . You should feel good about it . And we do . We do . It 's just me and my gang - Don 't have the facility . Exactly boss . Just think what we could do with a new building maybe a little more funding . Funding ? You don 't think we 're gonna put more money into this program do you ? I know . It probably sounds a little crazy . I know . Yes it does . And now that I 've seen this operation down here I think we should quit while we 're ahead . boss ? Hayes . this entire flaky program Out the door . ya know . it 's adios time . I mean we 're gone . There 's not another researcher in the country that 's gonna take us . huh ? gotta game of full quarter over here . Could use a good center . but no man . I 'm giving a few pointers to my little brother here . Loosen up . Anticipate . Come on Billy . Check ya next time . Sure . Billy . Can we get out of here ? I 'm not taking no shots . El . my friend . okay ? I 've got ten uniforms just like the one I 'm wearing at home . Now - Now that 's ten uniforms at fifteen ninety-five a pop waiting for a seven foot f-four star center to learn to play ball . stretch . Come on Billy . You promised you wouldn 't make me . bud. listen Okay ? kiss it goodbye . the only shot you got left now is the NBA Okay man ? Alright El ? okay ? Take your shot . You can do it . Just - you got it . just take your shot . loose . Take your shot . There ya go . There ya go . There we go . NBA 's out . maybe he 'd take us back if I got down on my Hands and knees and like licked his ' Wegians or something . isn 't he ? I - would you happen to be seeking representation ? of any type ... Billy . Billy . Huh ? What ? I think I got something that 'll get us back in . okay ? I 'm telling ya . I 'm serious . So am I you know that glandular serum I gave the little bunnies ? right ? yeah . Well I gave a large dose of that to something else . huh-wha - Are you kidding ? You gave yourself a dose of that poison ? Billy you gotta understand - understnad hell. you just started preliminary testing on the bunnies . How would you feel ? 7 ' 4 " and not being able to play basketball ? Do you have any idea of the humiliation - you 're a scientist man ! I 'm a scientist because I hate being tall ! Why do you think I spend all my free time on growth research ? I wanna be able to buy my clothes in normal people shops Drive a car without kinking my neck Sleep in a bed with my feet in it . I wanna be able to go out on a basketball court without feeling so much pressure . I wanted to get little Billy . I took the serum ... to get little . El ? How little ? That 's little . You in there ? Hi . There 's some clothes in my pocket . Do you think you could W - What 're you kidding ? You got clothes ? do you ? thanks . El ? What do you want ? Giorgio Armani ? give em to me . you always were into designer labels . It 's weird . Will you answer a few questions for me ? Sure what ? how long do you stay like that ? It takes about fourteen minutes for the hormone to wear off . What do you ... when you hit the back of your head ? Something like that . We call it a " neurological reflex . I can only do it once an hour . El . Think what this could mean to medical science . Think what this could mean to an army . whaddaya say ? Do you think the committee bought it ? Strickland : Does the army buy $ 700 screwdrivers ? They swallowed it hook line and sinker Now that sure beats skinny dipping on a hot summer day . What a thrill ! If those suits in Washington could see this . They 'd throw you in jail so fast it 'd make your head spin . How 'd you get in here Momquist ? In building this weapon you violated every AEC statute . Every nuclear arms regulation - On the face of the earth Doctor . That 's the difference between you and me . Congress drags its heels . we 'll all be dead and buried . The General wants to buy the weapon . I want to sell it to him . That 's how business gets done . The Beam sets up a chain reaction we can 't control . The computer simulations - were only computer simulations . I just saw an island disappear ! Next time it could be the entire ocean ! It is dangerous ! Doctor . Is that any reason to get rid of it ? Hmm ? Dr. Strickland . He just slipped by . Take him to the lab in the Military Division . no . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! This is dangerous . It 's Dangerous ! It could finish the world . I think we just found someone to test with the ice man . Ameliaaaa ! don 't you ? The same thing they 're doing to Biefneiter . Exactly . We 're talking inhumane here . Why do you think we never showed ' em Mr. Electricity ? Johnny Bukowski ? Yeah . And that - that - that - that uh telekinetic girl . nice - Probation officer . You couldn 't keep your hands off her . and she had a probation officer that was cute . right ? So now that you 're weird . why should we change our policy ? Because its the only way we can get our jobs back . big fella . You don 't think there 's anyone else interested in tiny people ? okay ? you got your uh ... you got ... . Disneyland . And you don 't think the government 's gonna buy them out ? me and my work is gonna end up top secret and in the army . Dinner . You know what 's really depressing ? these Billyburgers are not to rare . What 's really depressing is that weird people got no place to go . Billy . We were it . TV : The Joint chiefs of staff ... Hey ... met today with Humanidyne officials to discuss the construction of what 's believed to be a breakthrough in nuclear arms . The Neutron Beam is portable clean and has no residual radiation . I wanna emphasize that congress will not authorize the construction - until the safety and the security of the weapon 's storage site has been approved . Neutron Beam ? Are they Serious ? they 'd never build it . Lost the big enchilada twice in computer simulations . Los Angeles ? The world . Whoa . Wonder where Dr. Mom was during this ? I 'm sorry . Ca - Can I dry those for you ? I - No ? Nice Bikes . topic is favorite fetishes . You 're on the air . B-Billy . Dr. Mom ? You sound horrible . Where are ya ? Neutron Neu - Neutron Beam Neutron Beam . We saw it . Doc ? S - S - Strickland Strickland what ? Where are you ? Military lab . With - With - wi-the who ? With Bief - Beifnei Dr. Mom ? H - Hurry . Dr. Momquist ? Billy . You 're getting me into another one of your schemes . El . This is a rescue operation . cause Dr. Mom did not sound good . the thing to do here is just pick up the phone and call the police . Strickland eats senators for Breakfast . You don 't think he can handle the police ? El : You don 't think he can handle us ? yes . maybe . El . What we 're talking here is weird . Why are we parking down here ? You did call him ? Okay ? Well what 'd he say ? that he would talk . He said we 'd talk ? Right . Sorta . 'Sorta ? ' Billy ? okay ? He said he 'd see us ? Yeah . In a manner of speaking . Are you listening to yourself ? Do you realize what you 're saying ? Because he hated your guts when he left the lab . El ? I mean he was pushing me to the limit . but did you have to terrorize him with the water gun ? That was a joke . That was a joke El . believe me . The water could have electrocuted him so forgive me if I 'm a little skeptical that he 's gonna welcome us with open arms . No . No . See that 's - That 's not what I - That 's not what he said . Billy ? he - he said that if he ever saw us again that uh ... . He 'd blow our heads off . That was a heck of a welcoming shot there - here . You 're aim 's improving fella . you gotta be pretty tapped out after a blast like that . Um ... Why 'n't ya come on out and we 'll talk . B-Man . You 're lookin ' great . Does he look great or what ? Huh ? Great . I - I know the last time that we saw each other and w - I apologize for the squirt gun . okay ? I admit that . B-Man . I mean 46 straight hours of - don 'tcha - can you just lower your arms so we can talk . I just want to talk to you a minute . Okay ? I even brough you a peace offering . It 's - Look it 's - It 's Chuck 's greatest hits . Is that cool or what ? I already have it . El : Wow ! That 's incredible . You shot off two bolts and you could still move that fast ? it 's gotten worse . I 'll have a full charge in a couple hours . Hayes ? I 'm busy . Johnny . Huh ? Not interested . Whaddya mean ' Not interested ' ? I mean a - a household name - Don 't try to snow me . does Humanidyne need some new kind of secret weapon ? we don 't even work for them anymore . He 's telling the truth Johnny B. We just got fired . so you need me for a freak show . Or maybe the Department of Water and Power need a little more juice . That 's not it . I don 't care . This place is all I need or want . and enough health and welfare from the Musician 's guild to buy me groceries . alright ? And alone ? I got fried by twenty-thousand volts at my last rock concert or don 't you remember ? I attract electricity now . Lights dim when I walk into a room . My fingers spark . My eyes glow . I 'm a freak huh ? Do either of you know how that feels ? no . no . This dude 's .. a regular guy . Woman : It 's the girl in the corner . Run ! Man : Somebody stop her ! She 's tearing the place apart ! Johnny B : And you think the girl can help us spring Dr. Mom ? El : Her name 's Gloria Dinallo . She 's seventeen years old and telekinetic as all get out . No-one knows who her father is . but she 's locked up in a mental ward in Camarillo What 's wrong with my car ? Your generator light 's on . wha - what 's sucking all the juice here ? Are they glowing ' ? Regular sparklers . You sound funny too . I don 't think we ought a risk taking Mr. Fourth of July inside ya know ? okay ? See if you can figure out which hand 's positive . Whoa ! You wouldn 't pick on a guy that 's normal ? She 's as normal as we 're allowing her to be ! And you call what she did in that shopping mall normal ? Some girls dumped a bottle of perfume on her head . They teased her . And that 's a normal response ? It sure as hell isn 't criminal ! everything I 've done for her in the last three years is gonna be wasted . huh ? Dr. Hayes . how ya doin ' ? Bob . I knew that . Ms. Miller . Hayes . I - would it ? you read my mind . It 's our standard thirty-thousand mile check-up . We give it to everyone we 've tested . Not with Gloria you 're not . not like some sort of a freak . More tests at Humanidyne . didn 't it ? This time it may set her back . Three years ? isn 't that a lot better than keeping her in here ? babe ? Aaahh ! Strickland : We 're using temperature extremes on him to test his limits . General : Just make sure you don 't kill ' im . Looks like you 're getting pretty close with Momquist . You boys figure out who he tried to call yesterday ? Doesn 't matter . He was too drugged to talk . crazy ? ! Where is your mind ? ! screaming in pain . Haven 't you taught that girl any manners ? this is a violation of her probation . she 's in jail and I 'm out of a job ! She 'd be in jail right this second if we hadn 't come along . Alight. alright . I can 't fight you on that one . look . She 's seventeen years old . that 's all . Jane . I know what we 're asking is a lot here . But you 've got to try to think of what an experience like this could do to help Gloria too . Help her use her powers constructively . her self - her self esteem . To show her that being weird is .. is special . That weird is okay . when did Hayes and Lincoln do their research number on you ? A while ago . but I wouldn 't put money on it . A year and a half ago . She can talk . Terrific . Okay ? huh ? they worked on me two years ago last July . I know . You know ? You wanna tell me how ? I was at the concert when it happened . Jane took me there to see you . To see me ? You 're kidding right ? No . I like listening to your music . Still do . You mean you actually have one of our albums ? All three . a collector . Guess so Are you ever going to make another one ? No . I Uh ... I don 't play much anymore . buddy . Are you okay ? It 's the water . Water did that ? Yeah . Did you do that ? Guess you really are a delinquent . hayes ? ready ? Let 's run it down . Jane : Check . Billy : Temperature monitoring ? we got it . Frozen candy bars ? Johnny : Uh . Check . Billy : You 're not supposed to eat ' em B-Man . Johnny : I 'm hungry . how ya doin ' ? Running a nice special on Bingo Balls tonight . Does this have somethin ' to do with one of your experiments ? No . Just like the tunes . Oh . Well I heard they closed your division down . huh ? Tobe . Tobie ! what 's the deal here ? serious about all that " shoot on sight " stuff at the military complex ? Are you serious ? Set foot near that place at night buddy you 'll be shaking hands with the undertaker . Is that right ? ... Just curious . Evening . This area 's off limits at night sir . Well . Not for the company basketball team . wait . Didn 't anyone tell you guys ? we 're having our first team meeting in the Military complex Level one . we 're looking for a good forward ya know ? I 'm going to need to see some ID . Sure . I - Id 's . He needs to see some ID 's / Uh ... what do you think about a - Will a Tina Turner fan club card do ? I guess not . Glo . I feel ridiculous wearing this thing ! just because you had ' em lying ' around . B-Man . they help us think like a team . Besides I had ' em lying around . There is a huge groundswell - both in this country and abroud - that opposes this weapon . We hear the Russkies are shakin ' in their boots . Seems everyone is General . You know - and I know - that we - we don 't actually use nuclear weapons . is we stockpile them . At least that 's the theory here . Isn 't it . Course it is . is secure . See that 's - that 's your basic PR there . alright . ' Kay you guys ready ? You know I was hoping for a little bit more enthusiasm here . Okay ? 'Cause I 'm pretty darn excited about this plan . Okay ? Cause we - we 're ready . We 're a team . And we 're organized . And we 've covered all the bases . It 's locked ? ! It 's locked . Kuh ! That 's okay ! That 's okay . We 'll blast through it . Billy . We 'll just move that much faster . you got any juice ? Is springsteen ' The Boss ' ? Okay . babe ? everybody get back . Wow . you okay ? I had a little trouble with the thunder . Let 's go . get Beef 's stuff . Oh no . What 's wrong ? The heat from the Door meltdown set off the sprinklers . So ? I 'm a french fry . That 's right . It 'll completely short out his system . how do we get in the lab ? let 's go . Improvise . Uh ... pull the truck into the lobby . We 'll be back in a couple minutes . It 'll be okay . Gloria . Go on . Come on . we understand your concerns . And I can assure you that the name " Humanidyne and the word " Security " are synonymous . Yes ? ... . What ? ... . Oh . Something wrong doctor ? There 's just been a break-in in the Military Division . Hold it ! Glo ? Great idea . got a minute ? Aaah ! what 're you doing ? ! Nice move . You gonna do this at parties ? Glo . We 'll be right back . wait a minute . Get back here . Get us down ! Is that him ? Yeah . What 's he wearing ? El : We call it a refrigeration suit . It 's gonna make our job a whole lot easier . El : Billy . Yeah ? That 's Dr. Mom . There 's a door button inside . Yeah ? So who 's gonna push it . I am . right ? I told you . This is just what we needed . How the deuce did they get in ? sir . they 're talkin ' lightning bolts and guns that fly . Did they get a description of the aggressor ? sir . And ? and a teenage firl . In an ice cream truck . A what ? ! Heights are no problem as long as you don 't think about it . just - Alright ta - take it - be careful . Whoa ! hand me the yarn . Okay . Whoa ! Aahh ! El . crazy ? ! no jumping . you 're going to lower me down slowly . Got that ? will ya ? Okay . Okay . I 'm going . Hold on ! that 's good . Be real easy now . there you go . You got it . Just a little lower now . That 's it . All the things I let you talk me into ... El . a little bit more . Alright sw - swing . Just sw-swing . Swing . Swing just like in grade school now . You got it . For the benefit of man ... and science . Aaah ! alright . man . You got a career as a trapeze artist . you got it ? I got it . okay ? Relax . get him unplugged . see if you can get ' im to talk . What kind of military detachment you boys got here ? sir . Well bring ' em on out and surround the place . Dr. Momquist ! Yo Dr. Mom . Can you hear me ? it 's Lincoln . It 's El . Lincoln ? Wh-what are they doing to you ? What 's happened ? Neutron Beam . They built it . It 's real . The Neutron beam is real ? El . Save the world . Dr. Mom ! Dr. Mom ! Front gate says the truck was driven in by Dr. Hayes and Dr. Lincoln . What do you suppose they 're after ? Biefneiter . And Momquist . they 're not gettin ' out of here alive . wha - what 's the matter with him ? He looks dead . Took one look at me and he fainted . Billy . The Neutron Beam ? It 's real . Strickland 's hiding it in the desert bunker . And Dr. Mom found out about him . they 're going to do the same thing to us . man . Ohhh ! Ahhhh ! I don 't feel so good . You drive Dr. Mom . I 'll take Beef . Okay . get out the snickers . The Snickers ? You forgot the snickers ? ! Amelia ! let 's go ! Amelia ! great . Maybe someday you will be a man . And you will be the leader of a rock ' n ' roll band . to hear you play your music till the sun goes down . Maybe someday your name will be in lights . Saying " Johnny B. Goode gonna play tonight . ( Johnny B. Goode opening ) down in New Orleans . Way back up in the woods among the evergreens . There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood . Where lived a country boy named johnny B. Goode . but he could play guitar so hard it 's ringing a bell . Go ! Go ! go ! go ! go ! My god . go . Johnny B. Goode . I can 't believe you forgot the candy bars . I said I was sorry . Okay ? you wanna release the Thompson Twins and let 's go ? Whoa . hey ! You come back . Oof . What that boy could do for an army . Aaargh ! Whoa - Whoa ! no . Beef - Hey - Why 'n ; t you just get off there ? You probably wanna stretch a little bit . this way . no . this way . Here we - There ya go . we 're going to the truck . Ameliaaaa ! Who 's Amelia ? You are ! Huh ? Beefy . I brought her here for you . Hayes ? okay ? okay ? w - we found her for you Beef . It 's Amelia ! Beef . Amelia ? That 's it ! That 's it big guy . Just - Wave to him . Wave to him . Hi . Billy : Amelia is going out to the truck now . uh ... you guys can talk . so just keep - Amelia . Johnny ? Johnny ! Whoa ! This is serious . are you kidding ? ! Get in the truck ! man ? Come on ! Givin ' the crewcuts a concert . let 's get outta here . Come on ! Okay ? - Keep ' im comin ' . - Amelia . it 's in the freezer . They 're coming out . Beef . it 's right here . Give that truck a couple of mortars . we need a mortar at the door . Great . We 're outta here . what happens when he wakes up ? You 'll think of something . I don 't like the sound of - Hayes ! Oh boy . Where 's El ? bud . Oh my - Well it 's about time ! Don 't you ever do that to me again . Now where are my clothes ? Your clothes ? Let 's bolt . Block that truck ! Go ! Set up a roadblock ! I can 't believe you forgot my clothes . okay ? Hayes . I 'm not getting out of this truck naked . get in the back . Yeah . B-man you got enough for another blast ? I think you 're going to have to do a little face-saving tomorrow . That 's it ? and london of what has become the largest spontaneous protest against a new military weapon . but the first steps toward its construction will take place if it 's California storage bunker passes security testing today . Correspondent Cindy Saunders is there now . Cindy : The riverside mesa that will house the Neutron Beam is currently under assault as it has been all morning and the Navy SEALS have been unable to make it past the bunker 's secret water barrier . the Marines are having the same kind of luck . Senator Donner . Obviously we 're impressed . this morning I had my doubts . I think you 're referring to our other top news story today which was the break-in of the high security military complex at Humanidyne last night . Done by a group of subversives called the Misfits of Science . uh how shall I say this ? To see five people in basketball uniforms get past all that manpower . Looks like they used this freezer unit for target practice . There 's no way it 's gonna work now . How much further to the desert bunker ? About five miles up the next dirt road . I feel ridiculous in this . Billy better find something . Johnny ? huh ? Where 'd Jane and Glo go ? They went to the ladies ' room . I told them we 'd keep an eye on - Aw no . Newscaster : ... Wearing basketball uniforms . proclaiming themselves to be the Misfits of Science . Where the name comes from isn 't known ... You 're gonna eat the whole box ? Chocolate attack . believes that the Misfits of Science pink and black uniforms tie them directly to the rose red and black colors of the dreaded Black September Organization . The source is quoted as saying that black is ... These are extra extra large These are real small . Don 't think you 're gonna get into ' em . Gifts . For friends . ranging from the Scouts to the DAR The members of the group are believed to be led by a Dr. William Hayes . Formerly head of Humanidyne 's Human Investigation team Hayes is believed to have ties to subversive organizations . A spokesman from the F.B.I. reports that Hayes was known for his unconventional behavior in medical school in the Caribbean . - Sixty eight Seventy two . subversive trading and ... Just - Just keep the change . Thank you . Thank you . Very kind . Newscaster : Speculation that the Misfits of Science are backed in part by Castro is apparently running rampant in Washington Fueled by a photograph of Hayes in Ft . Lauderdale last April . but the rest of the stuff should fit okay . Great . El . I 'm serious . They 're calling me a subversive . Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to my mother ? alright ? other members of the group include : Dr. Telford Momquist . Dr. Elvin Lincoln . that 's Stretch . I know that guy . Newscaster : And a convicted juvenile delinquent who is reported to have been accompanied by her probation officer . sir ! I had no idea ! call the F.B.I. at area code 213-555-2147 . We repeat that number : area co — MacDonald CareyLike the sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives Hayes . and the Air Force haven 't been able to get into . it 's not going to get done . and the Marines don 't even look like they can get in . Of course not . I helped design the bunker . Normal people and machines could never break through . You think Strickland would risk all these tests if he thought they could ? with Mr. Biefneiter here ... How 's he holding up ? Just under twenty . Amelia ? But you guys said thirty-two degrees was fatal . okay ? it 's the only way we 're gonna get out of this mess . Billy 's right . If we can get in there and expose the Neutron Beam to the press ... to the world ... Then we might be doing a big favor for everyone . Right . wait . Wait a minute here . Wh — huh ? You guys got through an army last night . Don 't you realize what you 've done ? let me tell you something about last night . Okay ? Last night I fel — Last night I felt better about myself – about what I do – than I have in the past five years of my life . I mean that . like that 's okay with me . I don 't — I don 't care . That 's fine . But when I see you — I see something different . I see a team . I see a team that I know can make a difference in the world today . or what ? I 'd follow this man to the ends of the earth . Thank you . Or at least till the end of the day . Jane ? Yeah ? Would it be okay if I borrowed your lipstick ? Sure . Thank you . Psst . didn 't you ? The part about this being the most worthwhile thing . Jane ... All my life I 've been a goof . Ya know ? Comin ' up with screwy ideas . Leading people to do really dumb things . But I gotta tell ya . Last night I ... I did okay . I-I was okay . Am I getting a little mushy here ? Hayes I did — I-I really did . you know ? then ... I know . " You can take your romantic evenings and — I got the message . I got the message . Maybe you give up too easily . I figured I deserved it . You were a jerk . And you did . Announcer : We interrupt the music for a KLCA newsbreak . but they have failed to breach the security at the military test site . we gotta roll ! Looking tired and beaten . And as you can see behind me the people from the Pentagon and Humanidyne are just delighted . I suspect the reaction that you 're getting back in New York is something Different . Newscaster : Right you are Cindy . The reaction from around the world is not a good one . People are despondently wondering just who will be able to save them from the construction of this new and deadly weapon . Who will be their savior ? What 's the temp ? Twnety-four and rising . Amelia ? I 'd better ride in the back with Beef . B-Man ! Glo ! Johhny B ? I think they 're calling us . Pretty quiet up here . It 's dry . Things don 't grow too well without water . I know . That 's why I was thinkin ' ... Maybe I found somethin ' that makes me wanna give up dry land . I 'll come out and be with you till you make up your mind . and as long as I check in with Jane every couple-a weeks ... that 's not what I mean . - Then I 'll be eighteen ! I don 't mind the desert . really ! No . Why ? you 're a terrific girl . I mean it . But what I didn 't mean for you to think was that - You Kissed me last night ! I kissed Jane too . I even kissed Billy . we were celebrating . We 're a team . We 're like a family . It 's just like at school isn 't it ? that they like me . like your hair . Love the way you tore up the mall . I do like you . You 're like a sister to me . I don 't wanna be a sister ! You lied to me . You did just what they all do . I didn 't lie ! laugh at me now . That 's what they all do . Gloria . Laugh ! Gloria ! Gloria ! No . No . No way ! We can 't . Forget it . I 'd only slow you down . Now here I might be able to do some good . Go on . You get out of here . Go on . Where 's Jane . Wh - where 's Johnny B ? let 's go . Let 's go . Now 's the time you pick to have girl trouble ? Hit it Hayes . Teamwork ! yeah ! yeah Sigh .. sigh ... . Sigh ... Teamwork ! and with a little teamwork ! Got to have a little teamwork ! Always use a little teamwork ! And we need a little ... I like-a what you do to me ! what 's good for you is good for me ! We 're together like we got to be ! that 's all we need ! caught in the chill I will ! Teamwork ! Do it with a little teamwork ! Got to have a little teamwork ! yeah ! yeah ! Oh yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! yeah ... Stop ! I 'm the man you want ! I give up ! I 'm all yours ! don 't ever tell a woman you want her to be your sister ! How far back are they ? let 's go ! Come on ! Step on it ! I am . I 'm pushing her as hard as she 'll go . This is it . Ow ! Please . Does this thing have any shocks ? they 're coming up ! step on it ! I can 't find the turnoff ! Johnny B : Then pull through the fence . is : Do we really need another kind of nuclear weapon ? if I may . and its ability to keep ahead of the world . Now all I have to say to those people who don 't wish to keep ahead is : Tough noogie . Now as long as we have a safe place to keep this " weapon " and — what 's the problem ? The who ? Cindy : We have word that it 's the Misfits ! that 's the group that broke into Humanidyne last night it appears to be the Misfits of Science . It looks like their ice cream truck . I can see them now . There are two Highway Patrol cars that are pursuing the truck . And it appears to be heading for the entrance to the bunker . This is Macdonald Carey and these are the days of our lives . Billy : Let 's go ! Billy : Johnny B. let 's go ! Did you see that ? It 's incredible ! It looked like a lightning bolt shot right out of his arm ! I want that chopper on top of that mesa with a full platoon inside . Why the helicopter ? They 'll never get past the water . they might . And then that Neutron Beam is gonna rise up that elevator and pop out of the top like a barracuda in broad daylight . it 's gonna be mine . Jane . How bad is it between them ? huh ? let 's go ! Hurry ! He 's slowing down come here . We 're all slowing ' down . What 's his temp ? Uh . Twenty-five degrees and climbing . If the water barrier 's as big as Dr. Mom said it was ... okay ? I 'd say that 's not an exaggeration . men ! Let 's go ! it 's a big door . We all see that . I think we accept that . The door is ... is really big . But how do we know what 's really behind the door ? And I think - you know ? What 's the point of injecting something negative into this thing if we don 't really have to . you know ? then I 'm sure it 's okay . come on . What 's the matter ? Dr. Mom could be a bald-faced liar . Hayes ? Beef can 't handle that ! let 's get outta here . Spread out ! Spread out ! B-Man ? We die . they are the hope of the world . The Misfits of Science – or merely disgruntled employees – are apparently all that stands between mankind and the construction of the Neutron Beam . the people have cheered . And now – as you 're seeing in these live pictures – all the world can do is wait . Cindy ? Tom . It 's been some sixty-six minutes since the Misfits and the army entered the mesa . And we 've had word that there 's some kind of a Mexican stand-off going on in there . Hayes . Lincoln . Standing around down here for another hour isn 't going to do anyone any good . I don 't think any of you really wanna face that washing machine behind you . And even if you do get through there to the button I 've got a chopper standing by at the top of this mesa to scoop up that Beam before anyone can see it . So why don 't you save yourselves some pain – and the heartache – huh ? Who knows ? We might even be able to work out something where you can work off your time in the army . It doesn 't look like we have much of a choice . Yeah . General ! That was not my choice . Hayes ! Go . Hayes Four in the last thirty minutes . I 'm tapped . What 's he reading now ? Twenty-seven degrees . Billy . he 's a dead man . I know he can 't . Dr. Hayes . So I 'm gonna give ya thirty seconds before I send these men in again . huh ? Gloria . come on . We 're all rejects . It 's this family thing : One for all and all for one " . who were we trying to kid ? We weren 't trying to kid anyone . We — Glo : You guys were just out to get your jobs back Jane wanted to see you and keep me out of jail . you were just out to prove how cool you are Gloria . Well I think I 'm right ! And I think that right now I 'd just as soon be in jail Yeah . Yeah . El : Billy . El . maybe we did get carried away here trying to fit the Misfits together . Misfits don 't fit . El : No . it was stupid . didn 't I ? Billy . Come on ! Just the world 's worst leader . Hayes ! Time 's up ! guys . we 're comin ' out ! Beef ! No ! Son of a — don 't ever take this dude to the beach . You guys wanna give it a try ? Let 's bolt . get his glove back on . What 's his temperature ? 30 degrees . let 's get you up . After ' em ! We 're going to the rooftop . Don 't let any of ' em out of here alive . Let 's go . There 's something happening up there . I 'm not quite sure what it is . About to get word . the Misfits are on the move ! El : There it is . Let 's get out of here . Come on ! take him over there ! You have enough for another bolt ? I 'm tapped . Think I fooled them ? How ' bout a run ? but I 'll give it a try . Johnny ! The green button sends it to the roof . got it . go ahead . Singing Johnny B. Goode gonna play tonight " . Gloria ! Johnny B ! Gloria ! You okay ? Let 's just say that I 'm glad that you 're my friend . One of the family . B-Man ? I 'll make it . let me help you up there . El . so the world can see it . The Misfits have done it ! They 've broken through ! What 're we doing ? We gotta get upstairs . let 's go . construction of the Neutron Beam will now be postponed indefinitely . I expect that 'll make a lot of people very happy . but there seems to be some activity on top of the mesa right now . General Thiel . load it in . come on . Jane . you guys go on . You sure ? really . go on .

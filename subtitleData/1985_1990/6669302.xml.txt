[ static ] [ Male Announcer ] This is Network 23 's up-to-the-minute news on the minute , every minute , throughout the hour , where all that matters is all that matters . Following widespread international rioting caused by the cancellation of the Max Headroom Show , network chief Max Cheviot ordered its return tonight . Calm has now returned . Closer to home , the annual sky clearance program is underway . Normally designed to fall in the desert , this year 's satellite debris is falling in the city 's Fringes . Collecting the space debris has become a tradition with the Sky Clearance Festival with its symbolic steel umbrellas , and , of course , Miss Sky Clearance . Our telejournalist is somewhere down there in the crowd . We 'll have his report momentarily . This is Network 23 News , where information is fun . [ overlapping chatter ] [ chatter continues ] We shouldn 't forget the origins of Sky Clearance . a time when the Zik-Zak Corporation traditionally shoots downs its time-worn old satellites , and these very pretty debris showers turn the sky into a carnival of color . Sa-Sa-Satellites . Pretty . [ giggles ] Pretty dangerous . Not these c-colored showers , the actual ones still up there ... watching you . So tell me , how does it feel to be Queen of the Fringes ? Very nice . It 's changed my life . I want to travel , meet strange and interesting people , maybe even be one . [ chuckles ] Bresson has to start somewhere . You did . I 'd like to be a network executive . Well , you certainly have all the qualifications . That did it . Hold this ? Hi . We love your show , Ed . Popular , aren 't we ? Want one ? Where do I sign ? No , thanks . I didn 't know being famous was such a chore . You ought to come out more often . Oh , no . You should never mix business with pleasure . - It 's unprofessional . - Yeah , well , it 's ... not a profession that allows too much time for pleasure . Is it ? Is it ? What 's the matter ? Nothing . Yes , there is . This is the matter . This is censorship gone mad . It 's ridiculous . Have a look at page 2 . What ? " I have noted 3 damns , " 4 hells , " 16 cases of sexual innuendo , " a reference to self-abuse , " 2 veiled remarks about network presidents , and a joke about a son of God . " Doesn 't say which god . Yeah , I 'm sure it 's the current one . It 's probably the guy who 's running the censor computer . - Hey , Edison ! - Edison ! Happy Sky Clearance ! Reg , is that you underneath that salad bowl ? - Oh ! - Ooh . - Edison . - Dominique , your humble servant . Oh , don 't encourage the woman . I 've got to keep up appearances around here . Oh , listen . Come on . Meet Frances . She 's magic . Anyone told you recently you 're looking beautiful , girl ? - Dominique , walk this way . - Reg , do have some taste . Well , she is . You are . Isn 't that right , Edison ? Are you kidding ? With Dom in the picture ? [ overlapping chatter ] [ Man on radio ] Is Ben ready to carry out the raid yet ? Yes , sir . We are almost in position . Your men ready to go , Chief ? Ready when you are . Hell of a way to spend Sky Clearance . [ debris pattering on roof ] Yeah . Glad I 've got my portable dog house . Edison . Why don 't we have our own blog time , Reg ? Brilliant , isn 't it ? Brilliant . That 's her little daughter Mink . Lovely kid . Both Blanks . [ beat continues ] Here you go , Mink . This is Frances , Edison , Theora . Theora , Edison , Frances . And this is Mink . Hello , Dom . Hello , Reg . Hello , Mink . [ Edison ] Where 'd you learn to play like that ? [ Frances ] Oh , we just play . [ Dominique ] It was good . [ Child ] Mink , come on . - Come with us . - Come on ! - Come play with us , Mink ! - We 're late ! Hurry up ! Used to be your patch , didn 't it , Chief ? [ chuckles ] Yes . This was my neighborhood . When did you get out , Chief . Soon as I could . Thank God my kids got out . Someone 's got to do the menial stuff . Can 't have everyone a section chief . Stand by . [ beeps ] [ overlapping chatter ] That 's " kids " with a K. 'Kay ? [ laughing ] J for " joke " .

Those that can , do . Those that can 't , censor it . Idiots . You 'll like this place . It 's great . It 's got atmosphere . A pint of Green Kings , an Abbot 's Sage , Tawney Cobble by the neck , and Pepper Nine Triple Redondi . It 's not for me . So is that censor letter really serious ? Sure . A censor can pull a show if it doesn 't like its content . Yeah , I know that , but it 's someone just trying it on , proving that they exist . Yeah , they 'll have a law against thinking next . You 've got 10 years for lewd imagining . Oh , okay . Lovely . Come on , quick , quick , quick . [ stammering ] Ow ! God . When there was royalty , queens used to drink this all the time . I know . That 's what worries me . What does your hat say , Reg ? I don 't know . You mean you can 't read- - Oh , it 's all right , love . Nobody can read around here . Officially . How 'd you get this one , Dragul ? Informants . This human dung heap crawls with them . Time . Right , Chief . Let 's hit ' em . [ beeps ] At times , I hate this job . Come on .

[ shouting ] Where are you taking this man ? What has he done ? - No comment . - You 'd better comment . You 're on TV . We are TV , Carter . Wrong , pal . Ask them . You 're making this very difficult for yourself . [ Edison ] I get paid to do that . Now , before I say something we can 't broadcast , why are Metrocops working with Network 23 censors ? And where the- - are you taking this man ? No comment . How about you , Chief ? What can you tell me ? [ Chief ] Your fly 's undone . - That 's her ! - Mink , quickly . Get that woman !

[ Male Announcer ] Reports are coming in of a near-riot at the Sky Clearance Carnival in the Fringes . There are few details other than reported casualties which were moderate . Other information has been censored . Stay with us and make a date for an update . 23 News . This is my desk , Mink . Feel free to make any long-distance calls . - Edison . - Can I talk to you ? Sure . - Who is that ? - It 's Mink . Why is she here ? For what reason ? Come on , she lost her mother . Well , I lost my daughter and her mother . Nobody took me home . That 's because you 're a big boy , and you get to see them on weekends . Would you like a Candy Pax and some soda ? I 'll take that for yes . Okay . What would you like ? That ? And a juice . Okay . Mink , why did the Metrocops chase your mom ? No , that 's for you . I 'm not trying to buy your answers , silly . I think we deserve some more . Ooh . There . The censor mob just raided the place . What are these people trying to do ? Why are our censors involved in this ? Since when do Metrocops get involved in censorship ? Right . And were they asked by our censors ? That 's very nasty business . Apparently some tapes were pirated . Right , but that 's not censor business . Exactly . Somebody 's way out of line here . What are we gonna do about this little kid ? She 'll stay here until I find her mother . Oh , come on . Your turn to babysit . Right . [ chuckles ] I had no choice , Frances . I couldn 't go back for her . I have people searching . She 'll be found . I promise you . Oh , God . Bruno . How much does Mink know ? As much and as little as any child . What happens if they 're persuaded to talk ? She could tell them everything . But she won 't . My daughter , she 's a bit older than you . She 's 15 . No , she 's 16 . But I think I can remember this . This little piggy went to market , and this little piggy went home- - stayed home . And this little piggy- - Okay , let 's just do this again . I asked what her mother was doing , and she was terrified of telling me . Okay . I 'm gonna go to the apartment they raided , - so stay on me , okay ? - Okay . And this little piggy had none . - But this little piggy- - - Mink ? Would you like to know where your name comes from ? Come on . Sorry . [ Man ] Murray ? This is where I work . Let 's see if we can find your name . You can put your candy down . Now then . [ typing ] Look , there 's your name . Would you like to read it ? Okay , I 'll read it for you . " Mink , semi-aquatic carnivore " of the genus Mustela , similar to a weasel " with short ears , pointed snout , " short legs , - " and party webbed toes . - [ mouths words ] [ both ] " The mink became extinct- - " This is a view from a satellite camera . I can make it computer imaged to go in very close and find Edison . There . He 's that green light . When that goes red , that means he 's on television . Now watch . [ typing ] [ Mink ] Orville 's house ! Eyes open . All clear . There 's no activity in your area , Edison . [ Edison ] Thanks , Control . Is he looking for Frances ? Yes , he is . - [ Edison ] Plug in , Control . - Okay . No sign of Metrocops anywhere . Edison . [ Theora ] Keeping eyes open behind you . What are you doing here ? Come on , Reg . Orville used to teach kids to read . He used tapes he pirated from your network . I suppose someone grassed on him . Why did Frances run ? What was she afraid of ? Good question . I can use a good answer . How you doing ? Yeah , I understand . Maybe Mink would like to watch Doctor Friendly . I like Doctor Friendly . Okay . [ typing ] [ beeps ] ♪ [ theme ] He seems to be a big favorite , doesn 't he ? Yeah . Theora , how does she know about it ? This show doesn 't go to the Fringes . It 's pay cable strictly for the kids up at- - Hmm . You know you 're get-get-getting old when controllers start looking younger . Max ! It 's Max ! Puzzle . I 'll give you a Ch-Chinese puzzle . What kind of country invents a dish with pancakes filled with sauce , crisp-crisp-crispy duck , and cucumber , and then gives you a set of chop-chopsticks to eat it with , hmm ? Well , there 's no puzzle as to how she know him . [ Edison ] Can you find Frances ? I can try . What would a censor unit want with Frances ? And why Metrocops ? What 's the big story ? I think Frances might tell us . She might not . I 'm going live on this . It might get the worms out of the woodwork . - [ beeping ] - Control , Edison here . Theora , put me on the link . I 'm running a story . Can you tell me why these people were chasing your mom ? [ Edison ] I want to go live on this . I want to put the story up . There 's a chance someone who knows Frances might see it . I think it 's our best shot . Okay . Stand by . Overlay intro . Terry , on my mark . 2 , 1 ... Go . We interrupt current programming to bring you Edison Carter . This is Edison Carter live and direct , reporting a story which began earlier tonight , when a censor team with Metrocop support- - [ Murray ] What the hell ? - Censors cut him off . - What 's going on ? - [ Man ] What ? - [ Woman ] It 's shocking . Viewers won 't stand for this . [ Man ] They 're gonna have to . - [ typing ] - What the hell is going on ? [ Edison ] What 's going on ? I 'm losing the link . The system 's shut down . It 's a censor override . [ Edison ] What are you talking about ? [ Murray ] Right here . - Did you get that , Murray ? - Yes , sir . I would not call this sensitive material . Can 't you override this ? Override censor ? Good God , I 'm the chairman , not the creator . Sir , Edison is trying to help a girl find her mom . - That 's it . - Not anymore , he isn 't . Censor says pull it , we pull it . Pull it , Murray . Story 's over . Pull it . Have you any idea how suc-suc-successful censorship is on TV ? Don 't-Don 't know the answer ? Hmm . Successful , isn 't it ? [ Male Announcer ] The big news on Network 23 tonight is that the next 11 minutes will not be interrupted by commercials . This is network chief Ben Cheviot 's personal gesture to viewers on Sky Clearance night . Number 6 , standby . Terry , pull up the story . [ Edison ] Say that one more time , Control . I said the automatic censor tripped in . - The show has been pulled . - Automatic censor ? But I 'm looking for a kid 's mother . - How could they pull that ? - We don 't know . And the only person who can tell us won 't . - I 've got Murray for you . - What 's happening ? You tell me . The censor kills a story on a missing mother ? The network 's going crazy . That 's what 's happening . All right . I 'm coming down there . You think I can 't cope ? No , I just don 't like my show being pulled . I don 't like my top story being pulled . I don 't like my reporter being pulled . I think Frances is the key to the whole thing , and I want to find her fast . Theora , get Mink down here . We might need her to get people to talk to us . And get Bryce to stand in for you . Okay . Bryce , what are you doing ? Oh , I , uh , just created a new color . And I 'm working on a magnet that can pick up wood . No , I mean what are you doing now ? Great way to take off weight . It 's all a question of balance . Bryce , this is urgent . What are you doing ? It 's an educational tool I use to study orbital dynamics . We need you in control now . [ huffs ] H-H-Hey ! Where 'd he go ? That guy had star q-q-quality . Maybe he flipped . - Why ? - Talk to Edison . - Where ? - My console . [ groans ] Yeah , Edison . Thanks for coming in , pal . Okay , down to business . Can you neutralize the censor computer ? Edison , I designed it . Good . That 's what I thought . All right , what 's going on ? Hello , Reg . - What 's happening ? - You tell me . Censor pulls a story when there 's nothing to censor ? What 's censor ? It 's an automatic network system . We have stuff pouring in so fast nobody can check it , so the system checks as we transmit , certain words , references , sensitive subjects are just automatically cut off as we go on air . It 's supposed to save arguments about what is or isn 't permissible . It protects the viewer . So they say . I 'm not sure I need protection . I think Dom should use some , though . Sorry , I better go and try and find her . - Shout if you need me . - Okay . Oi ! Rickshaw ! We have to do it now . In a few hours it 'll be too late . The carnival ends soon . Sky Clearance will be over . The sound of that machine down there will bring every Metrocop in the city down on us . I 'm sorry , Frances , but Traker 's right . Can you find the strength to go through with this ? Yes , but I just can 't stop thinking about her . [ Traker ] They 're running out of time . Frances knows that . We made it through together in the Fringes , Bruno . I made it through for her . She always trusted me . And now you must trust my wild friend Traker . He 's a much tamer wolf than he seems . Trust him . He 'll find Mink . But we have to go through with our plans . I know . Thank you . Okay , so let 's do what we came here for . I 'm gonna go and get started . I can carry on without Orville if I have to . How difficult is it to fix the sensor computer to ignore me ? Extremely difficult . Virtually impossible . However , it should take me only about 10 seconds . Okay , first I want to trace somebody . I 've got no idea where she is . You got any ideas ? Sure , rewrite the principle 's chaos dynamics . [ chuckling ] Okay , sorry , sorry . Tell me everything you know . Last seen more or less where I am now . Go on . [ Edison ] North , initially , anyway . Well , that should reduce the chance factors by 50 % , unless , of course , she cut back , and it multiplies it by 200 % , or twice in possibility . It should be an interesting challenge . She couldn 't have cut back . The motor trike is too big to fit down the side alleys . What ? A motor trike ? Oh , Edison , why didn 't you say so ? - I was going to . - How long ago ? About an hour . If this person is still on it , I can tell you in 30 seconds . It 's a simple hydrocarbon footprint decay analysis . Does he ever frighten you ? Television frightens me . Bryce I like . Here we go . Hydrocarbon exhaust scan . Vehicle , trike . Time , 1 hour . Initiate analysis . And enter . And ... locate . Edison , you there ? Yeah , right here . Okay , the trike 's located at 74th and 18th , the alley east . - It 's pretty simple really . - Fantastic . Nice job , Bryce . - Is Theora on her way ? - Yeah . Don 't worry about it . I 'll update her on your new destination . - Anything else ? - Yeah . Stand by to dump the sensor program . [ overlapping chatter ] Now , you 're what I call manna from heaven , honey . - I 'm scared . - Don 't be . Men are more scared of us , Mink . Good luck , Traker . We 'll find Mink . You can rely on that , Bruno . All right , so now where ? Let 's have a look . It 's still hot . He couldn 't have gone far . Six feet would be far enough if she doesn 't want to be seen . Bryce , any ideas ? Yeah , sure . Don 't turn around , Edison . There 's someone behind you , and he 's armed . Supposed to tell me that earlier ! I 'm sorry . Just what do you want ? It 's okay . We 're just looking for somebody . Where do you think they 're hiding ? Under my machine ? Under the seat ? Look , we don 't want any trouble , okay ? We 're from Network 23 . We 're looking for a woman named Frances . We have her daughter . We just want to reunite them . Come on , this isn 't a story . We 're for real . You have Mink ? Yes , at Network 23 . You want proof ? I got proof . Bryce , give me a fast link to Theora . Sure . Connecting you to Murray , Theora ... communicationally speaking . [ Murray ] Theora , put Mink on . - Okay . - Mink ? Hello ? Hello . - Who 's this ? - It 's Murray . Mr. Murray , is Frances okay ? Tell Frances about her kid . That 's it . Use this , you 'll never take another picture . All right . Nice one , Murray . Pure honesty . Whatever it takes . One old dog , one old trick . Maybe I 'll show you some more . [ debris pattering ] Chief , get your men ready . Our informant is being most helpful . We 've located the woman 's video hideout . Let us now finish them off . That miserable dung beetle , he really loves to hate , doesn 't he ? Come on . Duty calls . Move it . [ Man ] Watch it ! Metrocops ! - Beat it ! - Get out of there ! Wait here . It 's been so long , I 've forgotten what to do . Genuflect . Watch your language . When will I see Frances , Theora ? Soon , I think . [ Bryce ] New location , Theora . It 's a church at 74th and 18th . Thanks , Bryce . Come on , Mink . We found her . What happened to the old religions ? I don 't know . Television killed it . We have better miracles . I used to date a lady priest once . Get out of here . Yeah . - What was she like ? - Terrible . She was always busy on weekends . [ Man ] Hey ! I want to see Max Headroom ! He 's the only guy around here who makes any sense . [ Woman ] They 'll cancel him ! [ Max ] Education . Wonderful thing . Contrary to what you 've heard , the oldest profession is teaching . Of course , the second oldest is the first thing everyone wanted to learn about . [ chuckles ] Frances ! That 's her . Okay , controller 's first duty is to cover his operator 's back . So in we go . Ouch . Control to Edison . Sensors in force . [ alarm blaring ] I think it 's time for us sinners to confess all . I don 't think we 'll have time . - Where is she ? - I don 't know . [ Male Voice ] Welcome to Our Heavenly Video Chapel . You may play to be absolved , or to confess . Edison Carter , welcome . Bruno . Traker tells me you have Mink . But why are you really here ? What 's going on in the church , Bruno ? A redemption of sorts . What sort ? Look , I hate to break this up , but we have a gang of sensors trying to bust in here . It 's keepers of the public morals , they 'll have no compunction whatsoever in smashing into a church . Now , come on . Carter 's double-crossed us . They 've brought the sensors . Come on . Now , I 'm no librarian . In fact , I don 't know what star sign I am . But as a famous person once said , " You can fool some of the people some of the time , but you can 't fool all of the people all of the time , " and as I , another more famous person , once said , " If you don 't teach them to read , you can fo-fo-fool them whenever you like . " Hmm . [ imitates insect buzzing ] [ police siren in distance ] [ Man in distance ] Okay , I finished here . [ Woman ] Where do you want this , Frances ? [ Frances ] Just bring them over here to the press . - [ Man ] Someone 's here ! - [ Man # 2 ] It 's Edison Carter ! Carter , you deceived us . You gave this woman false hope . You lying bastards . No , no . Stop . You 're wrong . I swear to you , you 're wrong . That 's the enemy , not us . Frances , we have your child . She 's safe . For God 's sake , we are against these censors just as you are , whatever you 're doing . [ crash in distance ] Bar the door ! I don 't know what you 've got in here , but those animals sure want it badly . All right , let 's make this fast . - What do they want ? - They don 't know . They think that Frances is working with Orville pirating network tapes for our children . What 's really going on ? [ banging in distance ] Come on , Bruno . The printing press . My God , that 's it . Frances and Orville are the only people with the skills . It 's very noisy , so we were using the sky clearance and the carnival to cover it . Look , we 're printing books . Reading tutors , lessons . It was her dream that the children of the Fringes should be able to read . To hell with was , Bruno . Do you trust us ? - Yes . - Thank you . Frances , get those letters off there and fast . Find anything you can to cover up the press . They won 't know what it is . [ Edison ] Control . Control here . You better do two things really fast , Bryce . First , dump that censor computer and then go live and direct now . Okay . - [ bleeping ] - Great . A practical field study of chaos dynamics . Oh , this- - Censor , prepare to meet your Maker . [ men shouting ] Go right through you ! Who 's down there ? Don 't touch that ! Wow . I 'm going for the censor ! Well , if it isn 't Censor Dragul . Edison Carter , live and direct . I want to know why you 're here attacking these innocent people . I do not know . You don 't know ? You mean you don 't know why you 're doing this ? No , and neither do I need to . My orders , Mr. Carter . I 'm sure your viewers will appreciate the fact that the censor computer works for their own good . Who decides ? Censor . The computer decides , Mr. Carter . Hold it ! Hold it down there ! This is Chief Penham ! I said hold it ! Chief , what have Metrocops to do with censorship ? Orders . From where ? Wait a minute . Are you trying to tell me that a computer ordered all this ? Yes . - Come on , Mink . - I 'll take her . You dare touch this child . You just dare . Come on . What do you want from these people ? Of course you realize that this program has been self-censored . You 're talking to yourself , Carter . Oh , no , he isn 't . This is Control . You are live and direct . - Oh , Mink . - Frances ! Frances ! Oh , Mink , I was so worried . Carry on , Edison . Censor hasn 't overridden this story . There you are , Mr. Carter . Your program will show the world what happens to information pirates . Censor has triumphed as inevitably it must . Apparently , Censor wants the world to see this . May we ? Please do . As the Sky Clearance Carnival continues outside , here in this secret video hacker 's headquarters , the censors have completed their second successful raid of the night , uncovering equipment used to illegally duplicate the Pay Education TV Reading Program . And now we 're completely in the dark , which is what the censors are all about . Overriding Censor 's pretty simple , really . You just cycle the command back into its own series mode , then it censors itself . [ yawn ] A rather boring program , if you ask me . Well , most people would agree that censors are a silly breed . In fact , it surprises me how they ever manage to breed at all . Hmph . This has been Edison Carter live and direct . You know ... I think I might be able to get to like it up here . - You 'd be very popular . - [ Women giggling ] You know , there is a moment there- - just a moment , mind you- - when Murray was very impressive . - He blushed when I told him . - Carter . Tell them that crazy Scotsman Orville 's been released . The job is done . The woman was not needed . Here . I 've got kids , too , you know . Chief , you turned revolutionary . If you consider decency as revolutionary , you can call me one . Now tell them to get that thing out of my territory fast . Mr. Carter , thank you . Seems the pen is mightier than the sword . " It was the best of times ... " Maybe mightier than the video camera , too . " It was the worst of times . " It was the age of wisdom . " It was the age of foolishness . " It was the epoch of belief . " It was the epoch of ... " in ... incredulity . " Freedom . You know , writers have no f-f-freedom on TV . One rude suggestion , and the censors are straight on their back-ck-ck . Uh , not on their back in a rude way , darn it . Ah , ' tis Ma-Ma-Max Headroom here , and I quote from the Bard . [ squeal ] Shakespeare , a writer . The quality of TV is not strained . It droppeth as the gentle ratings droppeth to our very tiny percentage share , and lo . ' Tis gone .

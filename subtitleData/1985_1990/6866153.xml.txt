 Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * * Who are you ? Your mother was my friend . What do you want from me ? ! I wanna help you . I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . No ! ( - What was that ? ) ( - What 's happening ? ) You OK ? What happened ? Where are we ? Relax , we 're almost in Phoenix . You probably had a bad dream . Like watching TV with your eyes closed . Yeah . Your mind just imagines things , but it feels like they are happening . I don 't think I like dreams . Not all dreams are like that . Some dreams are good . How long is this photo job gonna take ? I don 't know until I ... find out what the work is . Lou said to contact the ... Mister Arnold Davidson . Are you sure you wanna go through with this ? If I 'm gonna be Paul Forrester , sooner or later I 'm gonna have to do this work . Let 's go in there . We can call Mr Davidson from the lobby . Good idea , I could use a pit stop . I 'll be right back . Mr Forrester ! Welcome back ! How nice to see you again ! I was so relieved to hear you wear alright . Oh , yes , hmm Regarding the balance from your last visit , Would you like to take care of it now or , shall we just add it to your current bill ? Thank you . Alright ! We 'll just , hmmm lump it all together . ( Well , mommy is gonna have to spank you if you aren 't good . ) Mommy is so very disappointed in her baby , hmmmmm ... Would you take Mr Forrester 's bags to room 309 , please ? What 's going on ? You have an idea what a place like this costs ? Great ! On top of everything else , Forrester left a 260 dollar bar tab . Bar tab ? Something we don 't have enough money to pay for . I better finish Forrester 's camera work quickly . I 'm gonna check out the gift shop . Aaaagggggghhhh ! No prisoners ! Aaahhh ! I can 't believe it ! Paul Forrester here ! How the hell are you ? Aaaagghh ! I 'm OK ! How the hell are you ? Oh , a little older , a little heavier ... a little richer . So , who is it ? Come on ! I 'm buying ! Yeah ! It 's good to see you ! How long has it been ? I think the last time we were together we drank a case of champagne . Toshi ! I want you to meet an old friend of mine . Paul Forrester , Mishiro ! We have to complete out business , Jake , I 'm on a very tight schedule . I know , I know . Say , I wrote you from time to time , I never knew if you got any of my letters . From time to time ? Oh ! what the hell ? You were always traveling so much and I was the writer , not you ! Me the pen and you the lens . Right ? Happy you found a friend but I have to go . OK , OK ! Toshi , this is my past . What I past it was , huh , Paul ? I mean , did we hang Saigon out to dry or what ? God ! We got a lot to catch on ! You know , you 're coming to dinner tonight . In fact , you 're coming to dinner every night you 're in town . What are you here for , anyway ? To take pictures . Right . Of course ! You know , Kath is going to fall over when I tell her . Dave ! You give this man anything he wants to drink , put it on my tab . Toshi ? Let 's do business . God ! I still can 't believe it 's you ! Ah ! 7 o 'clock ! We 'll be waiting ! Mr Forrester , what will it be ? The usual ! I 'll have a chocolate milkshake . You wouldn 't ! It 's gotta be 100 degrees out there ! ( There we got , they are going to ... ) Dave ! Come on ! ( indistinctive ) Put on the One , Dave ! Must be the heat ! Here you go Mr Forrester , Never forget a good customer . Skål ! Are you sure he said " skål " ? I 've never heard of it . It 's not a drink I 'd recommend . The man with Jake , he kept doing this . Well , different people have different ways to say hello . Some people bow , some people shake hands , I heard Eskimos rub their noses together . You just have to watch what people do and do the same thing back . Amazing variety . Did you call Mr Arnold Davidson ? Oh yeah , he said to drop by his office tomorrow morning . He 'll arrange for transportation . To where ? To the place you 're taking pictures . Of what ? How am I going to ask ? You 're supposed to know about it . But I don 't ! But Paul Forrester does ! He was here a few months ago ! I 'm not Paul Forrester . Sure you are ! Everybody thinks you are so you just have to start acting like him . How do you going to act , when you 're gonna have dinner with your old buddy that you haven 't seen for ten years ? - I 'll go with you ! - No . I have to do this alone . You stay here and study . You know ? You 're beginning to sound more like a parent everyday . Thank you ! Kath , come on ! The man is here ! - Hey , buddy . - Hello , Jake . Hello , Paul . It 's been a long time . Ha , ha ! Come on in . Make him feel at home , huh ? Wouldn 't kill you . We were on leave , I ready to just to kick back and knock down a few beers . And Paul here drags me out to this orphanage , Don 't worry ! It 's way behind the lines , he says ! So we 're there for maybe ten minutes , first mortar round cracks in , Practically on top of us . I mean there was dust flying and everywhere , there 's pieces coming out of the ceiling , I look around and there 's Paul , taking pictures of the little kids hiding underneath their beds . I crawled over , Whooo , ow ! Are you crazy ? He says , I figured , as long as we were here ... Ha , ha , ha ... Those sure were some great times . Have some rice , Paul . Back then we swore we 'd never have rice again . Right buddy ? Have yourself some beef . Why don 't you let the man decide for himself what he wants and doesn 't want ? I know the man like my brother . And he doesn 't ... want ... rice . You knew him ! You knew him , like a brother , past tense , you haven 't seen each other in ten years . 10 years , 50 years ? What 's the difference ? Some things never change . If you stop telling war stories for a few minutes , I 'd see that ... you 'd understand some things do change . The woman loves to stick pins in me . Will you be in town long ? I don 't know . For however long it is , you 're staying right here with us . We got so many rooms in this palazzo , we haven 't even seen them yet . I 'm in a hotel . Yeah , I understand . Still playing it fast and loose , huh ? Living out of a suitcase , camera slung over shoulder , See what I mean ? This guy hasn 't changed a bit . Ha , ha , ha ... You son of a gun ! Take a look at that . Does that memories or what ? We were quite a team then . You the pen and me the lens . The best ! Are you still the pen , Jake ? I wanted people to see the war the way we saw it . I wrote a little over 300 pages . Then Kath came along , As far as I got ! I swore I 'd get back to it after I made my first million , but then it just didn 't seem so important somehow ... What the hell ? Look at everything I got instead ! This is it 's all about , buddy . The great American dream . Is that a good dream ? Come on , man . War is over . I did all this just for Kath . Hello ? Whooo , cowboy ! Slow down ! Hold on . I 'm gonna have to take this on the other phone . Paul , make yourself comfortable for a couple of minutes , huh ? I gotta take this call . Jake 's not here . He went to take a phone call . My God , you 're cold ! How could you stand it all night ? These last three months have been an agony for me , but I always knew you 'd come back . But Jake ? Don 't worry ! He doesn 't know , We 've got to be careful , if he suspected anything , he 'd kill us both ! - Maybe we shouldn 't ... - See each other ? I couldn 't stand it ... ( Kath ! I need my calendar ! ) We can 't talk here ! I 'll meet you tomorrow ! Are you sure you 're OK ? It 's the shank of the evening . What happened to the old Paul Forrester , huh ? Well , to tell you the truth , I don 't feel much like the old Paul Forrester . Listen , Come on down to the office , I 'll show you how I built this dream house . I have to work , Jake . I really need to talk to you , Paul , Don 't let me down . Wake up ! What ? What time is it ? It 's the shank of the evening , wake up , I gotta talk to you ! I was having this great dream ! She thinks that I 'm Paul Forrester . Who ? Jake 's wife ! Kathy ! She thinks I 'm the other Paul Forrester ! Great ! That 's terrific ! You pulled it off ! No , it 's not . It seems that we ... they ... were together . How together ? You know ... like a man and a woman ... You mean together , together ? With your best friend 's wife ? Not me ! Him ! You better finish this job and move on as fast as we can . Hi ! Is Mr Davidson in ? I 'm here to see him . I 'm ... Paul ! I was hoping I 'd see you again . I should have expected that . Go on in , he 's waiting for you . Paul ! Welcome back to the living ! Are you ready to go back to work ? I 'd like to finish the job and move on as fast as I can . Good ! Here . I drew by there yesterday . Couldn 't get within a mile of the place . Why not ? As if you didn 't know . You said it yourself ! This pictures are important , they 're worth any risk , and that 's why you wanted the assignment . Paul , good luck ! Ah ? Good luck to you too , Arnold . Paul Forrester is your father ? Yeah , ermm I was supposed to meet him up front but he 'd already gone . He didn 't tell me where he was working ! Don 't get excited , son , I 'll take you there myself . No , no , no ! If you could just draw me a map or something ? A map ? OK , sure , erm ... just relax . Mary Anne , stop standing there with your mouth open , get me a map . Thanks . And that was pretty slick , sending me to that guy 's office looking for you . Slick ? Yeah ! I didn 't know you had it in you . Neither did I ... It was fun . I guess that 's it over there , huh ? I guess so . Nobody 's here . It couldn 't be pictures of the place , could it ? Not from what we know about Paul Forrester . Or maybe this isn 't the place . Hold it , Forrester ! I think this is the place . So , you came back , huh ? Yes . What for ? Note a song and dance ? No , to take pictures . A little late , aren 't you ? This is no zoo , Forrester . We are not an exhibit . Yeah , you can 't treat people like dirt just because they 're squatters . If I remember right , you said it was important for you to come out taking pictures of us . Wait a minute , you don 't understand , see , he got tied up . We get all set then we don 't hear anything for three months . That 's why I have to take the pictures . Go on , get out of here . Squatters ? People with no homes . They live wherever they can even if they 're not supposed to be there . I 'd like to see where these people live . I think the man was pretty clear on that issue . Maybe Paul Forrester was right , maybe this was an important story . Besides , if I don 't take the pictures , How am I going to pay the bar tab ? Why don 't you take the picture of a rock ? Or a cactus ? Something that doesn 't shoot back ? I 'm a total and complete wreck , all I can think about is you and me together . Together , together ? I couldn 't sleep a wink last night , thinking about us , all the plans that we made ... I was so afraid . You seemed so distant last night , almost like a different person . Erm ... Who 's in there ? Erm ... That 's Scott ! I bet ! Still playing it fast and loose , huh , buddy ? Who is it ? You know ? I think I really could get used to this ... Scott , this is Jake 's wife , Kathy Lawton . This is my son , Scott . Your what ? My son ! He 's 14 . I thought I knew everything there was to know about you . I think I 'm gonna go get dressed . It 's nice meeting you . Why didn 't you tell me three months ago ? How could I ? Should I ask who his mother is ? Jenny Hayden . Are you in love with her ? I was ! But I haven 't seen her for a long time . I 'm surprised that I 'm not surprised . Irresponsible louse . I was asking for this . The same craziness that drew me to Jake . Are you in love with Jake ? I haven 't seen the Jake Lawton I was in love with for a long time either . I saw him last night . I know what you mean . Jake Lawton the way he was Always charging into a new battle . Me the lens and Jake the pen . You know , you weren 't talking like this three months ago . You wouldn 't talk to a man ! Three months ago was , erm ... different ! You bet ! So , where does this leave us ? Where does it leave me ? You know , I have no intention of being another one of your trophies . You want a souvenir of Phoenix ? Get yourself a sombrero ! What was that all about ? Paul Forrester was a very strange person , everywhere I go people are either kissing him or hitting him ! Hello ? Do I know you ? You must be Mr Forrester , I 've been expecting you . Is there something wrong ? No ! I 'm here to see Jake Lawton . from the far East . Well , I had the connections , didn 't I ? and it 's all safe in the bank . What I Kath . It 's very interesting . I had it made into a lighter , as a memento , the link between us . I saved your life , buddy . Now , I 'm calling in my marker . Just like we used to trust each other back in the good , old days . Then why are you going ? Look , let 's just get out of here before something else happens . Get rid of this Forrester guy , become Joe Montana , Tom Selleck or somebody like that . I can 't ! By the time I regain the energy necessary to do this again , you 'll be a grown man . I 'm afraid we 're stuck with Paul Forrester . You 're awfully quiet . Don 't have much to say . Tell me something . What 's going on with you and Paul Forrester ? You 're twice the man he is ! Why can 't you see that for yourself ? Hello ? Hello ? Hi ! Have you got a little smile for me ? Let 's go inside . They told me I 'd find you up here . Kath tells me you got yourself a 14 year old kid . Yeah . I guess I forgot how important I were . Almost wish I hadn 't run into you this time . I thought were dead and buried long ago . What things ? Just read it , OK ? - Ahm ... - Geometry . I am studying . Ahm , it 's a kind of geometry , curves and angles . You have that sound in your voice . What sound ? Slick . The sound of slick . I recognize it now . Study ! You 're not as much fun as you used to be . What are you reading , anyway ? Jake 's manuscript . I 'm learning all about him , what he used to be like , and Paul Forrester . They were like brothers . What else ? Soldiers come grants . Saigon stew . LBJ , dog tags , R and R ... I understand all of it , except for one thing . What 's that ? War . How long you 've been standing there ? Long enough . So ? So ? So what 's the punchline ? I 'm just glad you 're working at it again , that 's all . What 's with you , anyway ? What do you mean ? It 's the first time in months when you haven 't tried to zap me . I 'm sorry . How could I say that ? I 've been doing it too . Kath , did you mean what you said before ? about ... me being twice the man that Paul Forrester was ? Like in the old days ? I married you , didn 't I ? Yeah , what is it ? Jake , there 's a man from Washington here . What does he want ? He won 't say , just said he wants to see you . Stall him there , will you ? Erm ... Jake , what 's wrong ? Tell him I 'm on my way in . Wait a minute , Tell him , ahm ... tell him I 'm in a meeting and I can 't be reached . Anything , OK ? But keep him there ! I 'll try . Don 't try ! Do ! Cindy ? Get a hold of Fred . Tell him not to ship the Korean units to the Air Force . You got that ? Do not ship ! Please tell me what 's going on ? I ... gotta leave town for a while . It 's a business trip . I 'll get you when I get there . Jake ! Don 't do this to me ! If you 're in trouble , I wanna help ! Kath , you gotta trust me . I 'll be OK , I promise . Whatever happens , you gotta do what I say . Jake ? I love you babe . I gotta go now . Sir ? I 'm sorry but I couldn 't reach Mr Lawton , he must be on his way in . On his way in ? Well , good ! That means he 'll be here in a matter of minutes . I don 't know . I 'd like his home phone number , please . Well ... I can get it myself , of course but , your cooperation will be so very much appreciated . They tell the story , alright . I look at these ... I see you understand . I only took pictures of what I saw . Is this your boy ? Scott . Your , erm ... Your Dad and I go back a long way . Yeah , I know . Good to meet you , finally . You too . That marker I called in , buddy , now 's the time I need it . to take care of Kath , won 't you ? Like you promised . I read your book , Jake . There 's no time for that now , I gotta get out of here . The Jake in the book never ran from anything . What do you want from me ? A book was about the war , there 's nothing worth fighting for anymore . This is the kind of battle we used to fight , isn 't it ? Are you still the pen , Jake ? Are you still the pen , Jake ? Kath . What are you doing here ? Looking for you . Paul ! I brought this with me cos I want you to have it as a momentum . But I don 't smoke . Go on , take it ! There 's no debts between us . He 's got hostages . Hostages ? This man is more dangerous than I thought . Paul Forrester ? This is George Fox . Let the hostages go , you have no means of escape . Who the hell is that ? A man from the government . The government ? You mean he 's after you ? Not me ? Who is he , Paul ? What have you done ? That would take quite a while to explain . Forrester , throw down your weapon . Let your hostages go , you and the boy will not be harmed . You have my word . Now point the gun at me . I do mean it ! You 're taking us out at gunpoint . Like hostages . It might work , if I don 't pull the trigger . Just make sure they can see the gun . You know who those people are ? Hmmm . That 's Jake Lawton and his wife . I don 't recognize the boy . But I recognize the gun . The boy 's with Forrester . What about the gun ? It 's Jake 's gun . A souvenir from the war . He made a cigarette lighter out of it . Mister Forrester . At last ! You 're making a big mistake , pal . It 's alright , Jake , he knows the gun is a toy . That 's correct , Mr Lawton . We know all about things that aren 't as they appear , don 't we , Paul ? You and I have so much to talk about . - It 's a real gun ! - Run ! The Caddy ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Not bad ! I can 't believe it ! I gave you the lighter ! Did you switch the gun or what ? A cigarette lighter ? Mr Fox , I swear , I ... Noooooo prisoners ! Go on ! Take it . Thank you . Good-bye , Paul . Scott , I hope you find Jenny Hayden . Be careful , buddy . Next time you 're in town , don 't forget to call . Scott , you make sure he does that , you hear ? I won 't forget , buddy . Aooooh ! No prisoners ! Get out of here ! Tell me , erm ... What does " Aoooooh , no prisoners ! " mean ? Jake 's way of rubbing noses .

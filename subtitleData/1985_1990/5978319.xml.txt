 No lasers . No lasers . No lasers . No lasers . No lasers . No lasers . Hey , thanks a lot for helping us out . [ chanting continues ] Hey , Clark . You 'll never get interviews over all this noise . Oh , yeah ? Watch me . A good reporter hears everything . [ chanting continues ] Hey , T.J. , nobody 's allowed on the steps . Come on . You 're not telling me that the campus security is against freedom of the press ? Your own college newspaper , The Shuster Herald ? - Not you , Mr. Miller . - Back off , kid . That will be such a good angle . Come on . Okay . Well , you can 't shoot ' em all , huh ? Hey , Lana . Looks like you 're in the march again . Hi , Clark . Why don 't you help us out and get involved here ? I don 't get involved in the issues . I only report them . Well , then report this . They 're experimenting with engines of death in that building . Say that again . Punch him in the nose and do it . I can see the caption . " Irate Picket Belt School Reporter . " - Ready ? - Cut the clowning , T.J. Why don 't you drop your camera and pick up a sign ? Hey , like Clark said , I 'm the media , not the message . What happened to , " One for all and all for one ? " ( Clark ) That 's why we 're here . It 's rumored you 're gonna stage a sit-in . ( T.J. ) Everybody knows the sixties . Try taking over that building , you 'll be in jail . - Your dad 's gonna be proud . - They can 't put us in jail . We 're exercising our democratic right to protest . Like my dad did in the sixties and he would be proud . Look , even the football jocks are concerned with the issue . You two mashed potato brains should be ashamed of yourselves . Keep it up . Hey , way to go , fellas . So , uh , do we sign in or what ? Yeah , just follow me . To the end of time . The name 's Roscoe . Hi , mine 's Lana . So , Lana .. Nobody ever got anywhere by just marching up and down . Well , we 've been thinking about a sit-in . How about if we actually planted one of those picket signs on that experimental laser of yours ? It 's a great gesture . What 's that gonna prove ? - No one 's gonna see it . - You kidding ? 'Do you know how many cameras are gonna be clicking tomorrow when they unveil that gun at the press conference ? How do we do it ? Theodore here is the fastest running back in the country . You distract that guard up there for two seconds , he 'll get in plant the picket , and he 'll be back out before you can bat those pretty little eyes of yours . It 's a killer idea . Let 's go . You 're our lead . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] [ chanting ] No lasers ! No lasers ! Restricted area , Lana . Mr. Miller , this is a school building . Can 't deny students entry to it . I 'm sorry . Those are my orders . Just back off and shut up . [ dramatic music ] [ chanting continues ] [ Lana screams ] Ah ! Come on . [ chanting ] No lasers ! No lasers ! [ grunts ] Let 's go . Gas ' em . Gas her ? What a waste . Move it ! We got about 90 minutes to get to the main event . ( Theodore ) Otherwise , we blow all of this . [ dramatic music ] [ coughing ] Stop it ! Why don 't you unload her ? When we get the payoff , you can have 100 broads if you want . - Sex has nothing to do with it . - You got another word ? Two words . Bargaining chip . If we happen to need one . [ tires screeching ] [ chanting ] No lasers ! No lasers ! Hey , uh , Clark . Clark ! - You know that cop ? - Who ? Miller ? - He 's not at his post . - Wait a minute . He wouldn 't leave the entrance while the demonstration is on . ( T.J. ) No way . [ shrill squeal ] Why don 't you go tell security . I mean , it 's probably nothing . - I 'll check it out . - Okay . [ dramatic music ] [ coughing ] They went back . They took the laser gun . Who , Mr. Miller ? The football players . They took Lana . [ coughing ] Whoa ! Why are you so mad ? We 're on the same side . You just killed two men like it was nothing . How can you guys be so callous ? We both wanna make sure Uncle Sam doesn 't end up with a death dealing weapon , don 't we ? If you think the army 's gonna let you waltz in with their laser gun , you guys are bunch of idiots . Why don 't you shut her up ? I 'll handle her . You just do what I tell you . It was four of them . They-they took the laser gun . Were they students ? I figured they were , with the uniforms and all . But now that you mention it , they did look a little old . What 're we gonna do about Lana ? We 're gonna find her . That 's what we 're gonna do . - How do you feel , Mr. Miller ? - Terrible about the girl . - She put up a hell of a fight . - Well , did they hurt her ? Yeah , one of ' em belted her pretty good . Did they say anything about where they were headed ? Think , Mr. Miller . They must 've said something . Uh , look , kid . Get off my back . I-I 'm g-grateful you saved my life , but my head 's killing me . Sorry , Mr. Miller . But Lana 's life could depend on your remembering . Your thing for her can cost us 30 years in the can if she identifies us . I told you I have everything under control . Besides .. She knows she 's not gonna be around to identify anybody . - Don 't you , sweetheart ? - Don 't you touch me . Oh , ho , hoo ! Mr. Miller , come on . Think about it . What did they say ? Uh , yeah , the-the first guy , he-he said , um , um .. ... they have ninety minutes to get some place . Like a , like the main event .. ... or they would blow the whole thing . - Ooh . - Thanks , Mr. Miller . Ninety minutes . Ninety minutes . T.J. , what do you think that van could average ? Uh , bottlenecks and traffic , maybe 50-55 at the most . That 's what I 'm figuring . So let 's say , what , 90 minutes that would put their destination somewhere in that circumference , right ? Now what we have to do is find the main event . [ telephone ringing ] - Herald . - Hi , Clark . Oh , hi , Ma . Clark , how 's everything at school ? Um , everything 's fine . We didn 't get your weekly call this morning . Is everything alright ? Yeah , everything 's okay , Ma . Can I call you back later ? I don 't like the sound of your voice . Are you in trouble ? Not me . Lana . Lana ? Clark , are you thinking of becoming Superboy ? I 'm not sure that I have a choice . I understand . You can 't talk now . Just know that your Pa and I are sure you 'll do the right thing . Thanks , Ma . I miss you guys . Okay . So I can call you tomorrow ? - Of course . And son ? - Uh-huh . - Be careful . - I will . - Goodbye now . - Okay , goodbye . I love you . Bye-bye . It 's the middle of the week . There 's no football game , no baseball game . I-I looked up boxing and wrestling . There 's nothing . What main event could they be talking about ? ( man on TV ) T-minus 20 minutes to shuttle launch . Coming up on auto sequence start . The main event . Kennedy Space Center . Clark , they 're after this shuttle . [ dramatic music ] ( male # 1 ) Coming up on auto sequence start .. Move it . That van won 't do more than 80 . Go ahead . I 'll call the highway patrol and get on a chopper . What about me ? I 'll meet you at the Beach Cafe , Canaveral . - And look out for Lana . - What are you , crazy ? T.J. , I don 't have time to argue with you . Lana 's in trouble . [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ plane droning ] Right on schedule . ( Theodore ) Let 's hope that sub we 're supposed to meet is on schedule too . He 'll be where he 's supposed to be . With that arms dealer and our 20 million dollars . ( Roscoe ) You were wondering how we 'd get away with this ? The answer to that question just landed . Every eye in the country is gonna be glued on that channel . No civilian will be allowed within five miles of that launch pad . But who 's gonna challenge the chopper of a four-star general if it takes off and skims the gulf ? [ laughing ] Theodore , what do you say we test the army 's newest weapon ? - Let 's do it . - Hold on . What do you know ? It works . Yeah . Come on , get this thing off me and get out of here . [ beeping ] What the hell ? Get me security . Unidentified flying object coming in from the west . I 'm not here to hurt you and your weapons can 't harm me . Who are you ? I 'm called Superboy . I fight for truth , justice and the American way . ( Lana ) Help ! [ Lana screaming ] Good luck with the shuttle . Hey ! Hey , he 's getting away . I sure hope he 's one of us . Okay . Hey , what is that ? I don 't know but let 's get out of here . Move it . Move it ! We 're full throttle . He 's after us ! No . He 's after you . Not anymore . [ Lana screaming ] [ screaming continues ] Hey , Roscoe . You were right . Whatever it is , he 's going after her instead of us . [ laughing ] You didn 't want me to bring her along . [ screaming ] Easy now . Whoever you are , wherever you came from , thank you . - I 'm so scared . - That makes two of us . ( Lana ) T.J. ? - Lana ? - Up here , T.J. You 're alright . You can let go now . Hello , T.J. White . Shuster University , secret department of journalism . Can I get an interview , sir ? Nice to see you there , Lana . Who are you ? How do you fly ? - Are there others like you ? - Excuse me will you ? Hey , wait . They 're murderers and they got the laser gun . What .. Lana , w-where is it he comes from ? Up there . Isn 't he wonderful ? Who-who is he ? I mean , d-does he have a name ? He said he 's called Superboy . Yeah , he reminds me of somebody . He 's back ! [ chuckling ] I don 't believe this guy ! [ crackling ] Give it full throttle ! Get us outta here ! [ siren wailing ] Wow ! [ applauding ] - Here you go . - Thanks . - Hey , guys . - Hey , Clark . Look ! Lana . She 's okay . You would not believe what happened to me . - Sure , I will . - You wouldn 't . You missed the whole thing . There 's this guy , and he flies . - No kidding . - Yeah . And he 's so incredible and amazing and ... so unreal . - I 'm sure he is . - I think you forgot awesome . I did . [ laughing ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

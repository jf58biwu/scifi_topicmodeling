 wh — where 'd the headhunters go ? El : Shhh ! The Virgin Queen sent them away . I thought she was a Nazi . You 're not paying attention . This is a good part . wouldn 't I ? No . Billy . Billy ! Augie ! Billy ! Aug. Don 't let him do it . He 'll destroy it all . He who ? who will ? Mrs. Getty . Mrs. Getty ? Billy : Augie . Aug. What 's this ? hah hah Those wild and crazy scientific guys — I love ' em those Misfits ... Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! Billy : Dr. Morton Augenblickt – " Augie " to most of us - was more than just a professor to me . More than just a renowned archaeologist . More than just a leader in his field . He was a dedicated scientist . A visionary . A pioneer in Mayan studies . He was a ... a great teacher . And a great friend . Old Man : I heard he was a loony . maybe — - There 's that old tomb . That Naquatl 's tomb he was always talkin ' about findin ' . Heh ! Lost a good job at the college . too . okay . He was a little flaky . Alright ? at least give him credit for trying ! he wasn 't a quitter . Augie . Billy : You were a real good guy . A real loony . El : Naquatl 's tomb ? you 're starting to sound like Augie . One old map and now you think you 're ' Indiana Hayes ' . what have I got today ? Get this man an ashtray . don 't let him out of your sight . what about this Mrs. Getty ? who the hell 's Mrs. Getty anyway ? I 'm quite sure . But what is an equally important question for me is this : Where is the report on your memory experiment ? The memory experiments ! You forgot ? ! I forgot ! it 's not Billy Hayes that the board is gonna fire over this . Dick Stetmeyer . genetic memory Richard . okay ? is all . Is somebody paying you to research these naquatls ? Wait . Isn 't this from the company rose garden ? huh ? It 's kinda heavy though . lift this ? - No thank you . but would it be too much for me to ask what a naquatl is ? El : Was . He was the last Mayan king . Naquatl . Mayan ? Wait a minute doesn 't it ? I read his obituary . we think Augie was onto somethin ' . Augie was a loony . and I think we owe it to him to at least try and make some sense of this . Are these still wet ? Glo ! Did you know there 's a guy smoking in the lobby ? I 'm glad to see ya . El needs a favor . for me ? Please ? No . Here you go . There 's two Big Barnies and a fritter supreme . That 'll be three oh seven you just — it 's just a little favor and I don 't think it 'll matter . - No ! I don 't wanna do that stuff unless I have to . Not for you . Not for anybody . Billy ! That 's why I took this job . Gloria . I really do . But this is for El . It 's just this once . Come on . Please ? No . Wait . Wait ! Let me just ... leave . Because this ... It al — it always gives me bad dreams . It — No offense . Gentlemen ! I want those reports tonight . Please . Thank you . You 're welcome . I could swear I had two socks . A white one and a black one . huh ? Who ? the graffiti artist . right ? Wait a minute . You know a guy whose work looks like this ? Exactly like this . Only I didn 't know he worked on paper . I thought it was just walls and buses . Wait a second . This guy 's an expert on Mayan art ? Mayan ? Are you kidding ? This guy 's a sixteen-year-old dropout . It 's over a thousand years old . There 's no — wait a — wait a minute . Maybe we wanna know about this guy . Maybe we don 't . Stetmeyer wants those reports tonight you know this kid ? in a couple programs together . He said he was in a barrio gang . Maybe I could set something up . Maybe she could set something up ! In the barrio ? ! No ! Billy . No ! And if you think that you 're gonna drag me down to some barrio gang 's turf - well you can forget it . No way ! No ! No way I 'm gonna be able to explain this to Stetmeyer . Why do I let you do this ? big guy . Don 't fight it . will you cool it ? I 'm telling ya . I grew up on the streets ; I know when I 'm into a bad scene . You think this barrio kid 's stuff looks like your friend 's map . So what ? Does that mean he 's gonna know how to read it ? El : Maybe . It 's a stretch . There 's this concept called " genetic memory " . knowledge as your ancestors . So it 's possible — what 's the sweat ? We 're just gonna have dinner with the guy . this is not where you go when you wanna eat . This is where you go when you wanna die . Will you guys relax ? We 're just gonna sit down and have a little ... Pizza . El : Very little . Let me check that number again . I think somebody already has our number . I think maybe I should handle this . Do you mind ? Okay ? It 's under control . I know how to handle these guys . Listen . I don 't suppose we 've met — Shut your face . Fair enough ! we just came here to talk to Angel . We 're supposed to meet him — Not here . entiendes ? * then I don 't - I don 't suppose we should be hangin ' around . We 'll just — We 'll — man . I think I 'll have them when you 're dead . I don 't think you should — I think maybe I can find Angel . I 'm Angel Moreno this is my friend Elvin Linc — huh ? Glo : Angel . I thought you said you were in this gang . no ! I never said that . I said I want to be in this gang . right ? So why don 't I just show you why we came down ? A friend of mine gave me this map . I wondered if it meant anything to you . that 's my stuff . man ? yaknow ? Wait a minute . Can you really read that ? I dunno . maybe . and stuff like that all the time . I don 't know . He was always talking about the old ways . he gave me this . So what ? It 's justa buncha old Indian junk anyway . man . Angel . man . Can 't you read that stuff ? Yeah . huh ? legend uh — wait . Treasure ? Glo : Angel ! Ramon : Fry ' em ! huh ? I think maybe Angel can help you . we came to the place of the twin mountains . We rested till the rising of the sixth sun . That 's all there is . man . That 's worse than one of those maps you get on your placemat at the Pancake Hut . and if Stetmeyer finds out — you can always sue me . huh ? ya know ? It 's a buncha hype What is ? That kid . I know his kind from way back . but they 're takin ' us for a ride . huh ? This jaguar is solid jade . Rubies in the eyes . They say it 's some kind of ' idol ' . too . This guards the tomb . we 're gonna be rich . Billy ! You and I have got to — Richard . Dick ! We were looking for ya . right ? Wrong ? I knew it . Even after I said not to . Even after I said please not to — El ; Wait . Billy thinks that Augie might really have been onto something and last night somebody tried to run us down . where — Billy : They tried to kill us ! Do you have any idea what Augie was up to before he died ? Do you ? I never get to finish my — alright ? For years he 's been obsessed with one question – one question : this map tells us that — According to whom ? I don 't think we met . I 'm Angel Moreno . Pleasure 's mine I want you working on those memory experiments . And I mean working on — Richard . Wait . Look . Two little words . Genetic . Memory . he can read that map ? Nooo problem . isn 't it ? use this as a sort of visual aid in your report — wait a minute . It gets better . Richard . the entire Mayan civilization just disappeared from the Earth . it 's not ' Billy Hayes ' . Am I correct ? We believe that Augie found a map – this map – that shows what happened That 's just what I 'm saying . This map of yours is nothing special . There 've been maps like that for years . People – qualified people – have searched all through the Mexican mountains and never found any — - Wait . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! Billy : The placemats at the Pancake Hut . Hold on . It 's not the Mexican mountains . It 's the Santa Monica mountains . That 's what happened to the Mayans ! They went to L.A. you know huh ? I — I know what it 's like . I was right where you are . I didn 't have a school . I didn 't have a family . Who said I ain 't got no family ? I got a family . The Topos . A street gang ? That 's a family ? These guys . Are they your family ? Yeah . Kinda . you tell me what the hell it is . we 're just the same . but you better not trust me . I don 't trust ' im . And I can 't believe I 'm playing along with Indiana Hayes on the word of that kid . Not just the kid . We had the computer triangulate off the most recognizable mountain peaks . We did some grid overlays . We think we 've traced the point on the map to the exact area . Give or take a few feet . is we gotta poke around under this spot and we should find the temple . What spot ? Where in this whole town do you pick to look for a buried Mayan temple ? Don 't get stopped in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills Don 't get wild in Beverly Hills You gotta have style in Beverly Hills You look around thinkin ' your number 's up You see the lights flash in your eyes It 's goin ' down louder than thunder thinkin ' those lies There 's no escape once they get to you There 's no excuse they 're gonna buy let me warn you so don 't even try Don 't even try Don 't get stopped in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills Don 't get wild in Beverly Hills You gotta have style in Beverly Hills everything 's by the book There ain 't no slack when they 're around You better not give them no reason don 't make a sound You see them out cruisin ' your neighborhood It 's always cool when they 're around you better dial that number the best in this town Don 't get stopped in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills Don 't get wild in Beverly Hills You gotta have style in Beverly Hills Don 't get stopped in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills Don 't get wild in Beverly Hills You gotta have style in Beverly Hills uh ... Corner up ahead . We can ... or that one ? Billy ? alright ? we 're gonna scope out the diner here . check out this boutique . - Alright . - Alright . alright ? will ya ? Mr. Stockholm . George . This is a good start . or after dessert ? or something . I 'm gonna look around for some stairs and you keep your eyes on him . He 'll be fine . Yes sir . Will that be cash or charge ? what the heck . Let 's charge that sucker . Mr ... Stetmeyer . Excuse me . Do — Must be new here . what we need to find is a basement or — they have wine here . Lots of restaurants are doing that now . You know daddy gets mad when you play with his toys . you 're so embarrassing . Tuck your shirt in . Fix your hair . I 'll get the others . I 'll be right back . excuse me . We need a table for five . sir . We have no tables . What are you talking about ? There 's ... okay ? this get us a table ? it will . And will you be requiring chairs as well ? Glo : How much is this ? Clerk : Four hundred and twenty five dollars . Four hundred and twenty five dollars ? Fusebox . Gloria . And you 're sure you prefer a table in the back ? absolutely . It 's necess — Unless that 's a problem ? no . In the back will be just fine . I gotta renegotiate with my agent . Your waiter 's name is Tim . He 'll be here in a moment to take your cocktail orders . Angel : How come we didn 't wait for the cocktails ? Glo : Shhh ! Angel . Shhh ! El : I wonder if red or white goes better with prison food . Wait a minute . Guys ? Look at this . Whoa ! Bingo . Let 's go . 'cause I really hate it down here . or something . like that jade rattlesnake that 's supposed to mark the temple . this is — this is it . I know it is . Trust me ; I don 't think Augie would lead us down a blind ... Alley . wait a minute . There 's a crack in the wall . I-I can feel some air . He 's right ! Okay . I know there 's something behind it . can you knock this thing down ? I don 't think I have the juice . really damp down here . please ? El : Naquatl 's tomb . Incredible . or what ? So what are we waiting for ? Let 's get something to show for proof . Come on . Hold it right there ! The man ! Don 't get stopped in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills Don 't get wild in Beverly Hills You better walk soft in Beverly Hills kid . Park it where you can see it . Thank you ! Angel ! arrest these people . For what ? Breaking and entering . Entering what ? The basement vault of the Holbank Museum . Mr. S. ? Exit time . Mr. S. : Don 't you think they got a bit close ? we 're in . Do you think so ? I don 't . I don 't think we 're ' in ' . these jerks come sniffing around . Mr. Stoffer . You got a lotta things . I want one more thing . And I 'm outta time . Get me the kid . you don 't buy what they say in that paper . Street kid can 't read that map . and I can 't barely read . I want the kid . I need him . He 's in the barrio . It 's ozone heavy down there . I could drive around for years in that pit before I find ' im . Then I suggest you gas up . this thing must use a heck of a lot of gas ! it depends on if you 're being chased by the cops . Actual mileage may vary . Angel . You did alright . This is one fine car . You 're damn straight . do I gotta go back ? Of course you gotta go back . You gotta finish . Finish ? I did . I went . I came back with this . When are you gonna take back this car ? Take back the car ? how come ? man ! now can you ? Don 't be stupid then we could talk . tryin ' to get in the gang and all . But you don 't take the time to figure out what 's what Heeey . C 'mon . C 'mere . I got something for you . The Topos ' ring ! It 's yours for one day . And then tomorrow – if you bring back that treasure we were talkin ' about – okay ? huh ? I 'll kill ' im . will you lighten up on Angel ? no see . Hayes . he didn 't . Really . Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get them out ? Do you ? It was just a little misunderstanding . Dick : Several . That 's how many . very tight . A ' little misunderstanding ' could land her back in juvenile hall Do you realize she 's still on probation ? the board could put me on probation . I could lose my company car ! Hayes ! alright ! Maybe I did get carried away . Okay ? Maybe you guys were right about the ' Indiana Hayes ' thing . Nice hat . And maybe this was just another one of Augie 's flaky dreams . I don 't know . or the way Angel read that map . I had a feeling in my gut that we were really onto something . And i-if we weren 't ... then I 'm sorry the boy was — Richard . so we could put an end to this thing once and for all . But ... man . Angel ! You only got Diet ? Angel . I oughta break your — Johnny . Sparky . huh ? You found the tomb ? Uh-uh . Mrs. Getty . let me present ... Mrs. Getty ! So ? Oh yeah . I should 've expected this . Seeing as how I haven 't been made a fool of in at least an hour . Wait a minute . Screws are loose . That 's what I 've been saying . come here . Help me with this . - Alright . three . Augie . El : So what 's the story ? He was here . too . there 're some lanterns and some flashlights in the truck . Sparky ? or what ? why not ? Hayes . I happen to be an officer of the court . Crime looks real bad on my resume . Jane . can you do me a favor ? Can you guard the getaway truck ? Thanks Johnny : Whoa ! Looks like Indiana Hayes finally scored one . Glo : It 's beautiful . El : Fantastic ! This is incredible ! can you read this ? I don 't know . come on . Try ! ( foreign Language ) The seventh sun is setting in the house of Naquatl . And time is ... Setting with me . You okay ? dos quatro ! All right ! Wooly bully Wooly bully watch it Aaahh ! figures . Hey ! It says something here . Oh my gosh ! Angel ! Incredible . Let 's go . Come on . I 'm impressed . You really can read the walls . Angel ? Is he a friend of yours ? man . My friends don 't hang around much under Beverly Hills . Jane ! Gloria . Chill out . huh ? Turns out we 're all after the same rock . though – and I 'm not afraid to admit it – that tunnel . finding this place is easy enough . You pulled it off . Even that idiot Augenblickt managed it . eh ? That 's the trick . Mr. Moreno . huh ? There 's a fortune in other stuff down in that tomb . You can have it . isn 't it ? stay here with your playmates ... You 'll die . Angel . So what 's it gonna be ? treasure ? Angel ! don 't ever trust me . I suggest you all take a deep breath . It can get pretty stuffy down here . Billy ! It 's a law of science : the more oxygen you use . Sit down . No ! I 'm gonna get us out of it . one more little bolt ? It 's too damp down here . No static electricity . or something Did you see that ? You see that flicker ? It flickered . That means there 's a hole or something . Air is coming through somewhere . A small space . Anything that could — Right there ! Right there . You see the hole on the top of the ledge ? You see it ? Hayes . huh ? Not a bad idea . Maybe if the package were just a little smaller ? That could work . Angel : This is some business you got here Stoffer contractors ? ! For now . Till I get what I want . so I 'm paying a fortune in union overtime . what takes so long about putting on a jogging suit ? uhuh ... I 'm not wearing the jogging suit . Glo : What are you wearing ? Johnny : Michael Jackson ? and this is all the toy store had in my size . Angel . How does it make you feel ? You want somebody to do that to your paintings ? Shut up . can you see anything ? there 's air coming in . I think I can squeeze through . How much time till I grow ? You got twelve minutes Nooo problem . the temple . Show me where . El ; Uh oh . What 'd he say ? Uh oh " . Uh oh " . I think I 'm stuck . Did he say " stuck " ? He said he 's stuck . stuck " ? You can 't be stuck ! What happens when he gets big ? what happens when I get big ? Uh oh . please don 't tease let me squeeze ! But my heart goes round and round And my love comes tumblin ' down . Zoop ! ahh ! Do you mind not weirding out on me right now ? Okay ? okay ? And I gotta think of something . little guy . We 're workin ' on it . Four minutes . It 's here . Where ? Behind this wall ? How do you know ? I don 't know how I know . You better hope you 're right . Tell Carter to get his drill . No ! No . Angel ? Will I leave only this ? Like flowers that wither . Will nothing last but my name ? I can 't . kid . what 'd I do ? What 'd I do ? Lady ? run ! don 't touch that rock ! quick ! I need your help . I don 't have much time . man . I think I seen this on " The Twilight Zone " .

I wish this would happen to you guys just once . Stop ! It 's booby-trapped ! How do you know ? Angel : I just know . I hope you don 't mind if I take my chances . Jane ! don 't be a hero ! be a hero . Johnny : Angel ! Out this way ! Sparky . huh guys ? Guys ? are you guys gonna be finished by eleven ? Are you kidding ? Angel is such a slave driver now that he 's getting paid to do this . Jane : He 's getting a lot of offers ? yes ! He 's even thinking about getting an agent . Angel : Gloria ! Alright already ! My index finger is killing me ! The last Mayan artist . Pretty incredible . Angel : Did you guys happen to get a good look at the big statue in the temple ? or did that look like Angel ? you 're not crazy . It 's kinda like Augie used to say : Science can only unlock the doors " . Maybe there are some things science still can 't answer . maybe when the city raises the money to excavate — if they raise the money . Billy . It takes time . And they have to do it right Augie woulda wanted it that way . he would 've . Hayes . pay you back for saving my life ? you didn 't go for any of my suggestions . Right . But I wanted to get you something So ... Um ... What you got there ? Ta da ! - That 's it ! That 's the one . here . or what ? I 'm serious . No . But they didn 't have one with a propeller .

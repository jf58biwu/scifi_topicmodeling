 Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * * Who are you ? Your mother was my friend . What do you want from me ? ! I wanna help you . I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . Thanks a lot ! Thank you ! What now ? We need to get away from the highway , stay out of sight for a while . Camping out again , huh ? You know , if Fox wasn 't too far behind us , We ought to blend in here , lay low til the things are gone . Can 't we try like a hotel or something ? I mean there all sorts of wild animals out here . Don 't worry , I won 't let anything eat you . That 's easy for you to say ! Plus we don 't have enough money for a hotel . Where have I heard that one before ? Where are you going ? ( That thing 's gotta be hurt , right ) - Look out ! - Look out , look out ! Way to blend in . I couldn 't leave him there . No one else could have helped . Maybe they won 't say anything . Hey Mister , are you gonna help the bird ? Yes . There 's a vet just up the road . Vet ? Thanks a lot ! We 'll find him . What 's a vet ? Erm , veterinarian ? Doctor for animals . Do you know anything about birds ? Oh , I had a pet canary once . His name was Waldo . I don 't get it . Why didn 't you just take out the old silver sphere , sap the bird , make it better and we move on ? Cos I don 't know what 's wrong with it . One of these days you 're gonna tell me what your powers really are . One of these days , maybe you 'll know . Mister , that 's a wild bird , my dog 's going crazy , get that thing out of here ! But it 's hurt ! You got no business coming in here like that and scaring my little Sylvie . She has a nervous condition as it is . I 'm sorry if I ... What kind of a pet is that to have anyway ? Shhhh ! Quiet ! Thank you . I don 't believe it . Bring that in the backroom , quickly . I 'll be right back . A peregrine falcon ! Wild ! Just sat on your arm all the way over here ? You always have this magical effect with wild birds of prey ? It knew I wouldn 't hurt it . I 'm Casey Flynn . I 'm Paul Forrester . You 're not from around here , are you ? No , we 're not . We ? My son Scott and I , the boy in the waiting room , we 're just passing through . Well , Mr Paul Forrester . Now , we 've gotten you and me and Scott taken care of , what do you say we get a name for this poor bird ? Waldo . Waldo ? He 's a she , you know ? I like Waldo . Well , let 's take a look at old Waldo here . Ahh . Oh yeah . It 's broken . Probably flew into a wire . I won 't be able to do anything now , she needs to be tranquilized . Once I set that wing , it 'll be at least three weeks before she 's mended . I 'd like to help her fly , if I can . Well , OK . Let 's get her comfortable for the night . Bring her down here . We just have to find a cage for Waldo . Over here , this way . It 's OK . Since she 's in shock , she needs to be quiet for a while . You have quite a way with animals , don 't you ? I could use an extra pair of hands around here . Just be feeding the animals , cleaning the cages , giving them vitamins , that sort of thing . I mean , it wouldn 't pay much , but I do have a spare room in the back if you need a place to stay . I 'd like to help with Waldo . Of course ! And I have a job for your son , too . Baby-sitting ? This is Joey . Joey ! Say hello to Scott ! I guess your magic touch only works with cougars and birds . Come on , you guys . I 'll show you your room . You got us into this because she 's pretty , right ? Well , this is a nice place to lay low til Fox goes away . So , after my husband left , I decided to move up here . What do you do , seems like a nice way to make a living . It would be if I were ! See , I thought I get some work from the farms in the area but , it hasn 't worked out that way . I 'm just not getting invited to take care of the local cats and dogs . Would you like another ear ? No , thank you . I have all I need . Excuse me . Casey 's animal farm , we 're closed . Very funny . Casey , it 's Harold . I got Mona Jean here and she 's just playing miserable , I 'm sorry I 'm late . It 's OK , Harold , I 'll be right there . Mona Jean 's just playing miserable . Maybe this won 't be so bad after all . Nice house , pizza for dinner , the kid 's sort of cute ... He likes you ! How can you tell ? I 'm an alien , I have these powers . Harold ! Come on in ! I really appreciate this , Case ! She 's been chewing on that all day . She 's gonna be OK ! Just pick her up after the weekend , OK ? Alright . Come here , Mona Jean . You try and get some sleep now , darling . Oh , by the way , be extra careful tonight . Lock all your doors and windows . What are you talking about ? Well , it 's been all police calls all day , a man aged 35 , he 's traveling with a teenage kid , it appears they 're after him . God only knows what he did . You just be careful , you hear ? Harold ? What is it , Case ? You 've seen somebody like that ? No , it 's nothing . Good night . Night ! Joey ? Oh , honey ... Is something wrong ? No ! No , it 's just , ermm ... It 's past Joey 's bedtime , I don 't want him to get too excited . Why don 't you guys clear off the table , OK ? You know , I feel like I 've told you my whole life 's story over dinner , and I don 't know anything about you . What would you like to know ? What you really do for a living . I 'm a photographer . Is work that bad or are you just not that good at it ? I don 't understand . You snapped at this job as if you needed the money . I do ! Are you afraid of me ? No . Should I be ? If I make you uncomfortable , we can leave . No . I just got tired , that 's all . Where are you and Scott headed ? South . Where 's Mrs Forrest ? There isn 't one . I 'm sorry , I guess I should have asked you all these things before I hired you . For all I know you could ... turn out to be an escaped murderer . I 'm not . It 's really important for you to stay and help that bird , isn 't it ? Yes . Why ? I don 't know . I feel for it . Good night . Good night , Casey . Chief Galley ? Hmm . Chief , I 'm George Fox , I 'm with the Federal Security Agency . Is that your car parked outside ? Yes , it is . One of my officers sees that , you 're gonna get yourself a ticket . I 'm here on government business , Chief . Ha . Mister , my officers will give a citation to Air Force One , if they found him parked in a red zone . Well , I 'll take my chances , Chief . Suit yourself . Come on in , Mr Fox , have a seat ! Thank you ! What can I do for you ? Oh , no Sir , don 't seat there , that 's Mona Jean 's spot . She kind of likes it to herself . Alright . She 's not here right now but ... Chief , Chief , it 's alright , believe me , it 's alright . Now , what I 'm doing is looking for the ยก is man and this boy . - They 're known to be traveling in your a ... - Ohhh ! You got a thing on him on the radio , what 's he done ? I 'm afraid that classified information , Chief . Come again ? Classified ! National Security ? Very secret and very important . You mean the charge is classified ? That 's right . Ha , ha , what is it ? Some kind of spy ? I can 't tell you that , Chief . That 's why they call it classified . Oh now , that sounds serious . It is serious . Very . And what do you want from me ? I 'd like to have your cooperation , I 'd like to have you put all your men on alert , If you find him , hold him for me , hold both of them for me . This is where I 'm staying . Oh no , I don 't know , round here we like something to hold a man on . But you will do it for me , anyway , won 't you Chief ? Huh ? Professional courtesy ? One lawman to another ? Ha , Ha ... Where are we going ? Foundation for birds of prey . A captive breeding program . Pay attention , you 'll be making this trip by yourself starting tomorrow . You sound as if you don 't like this place . I don 't ! Why ? They have a different approach to things than I do . I don 't believe in interfering with Mother Nature . And they do that here ? Just a bit . Why doesn 't someone make them stop ? Why didn 't I think of that ? Hey you ! Hey yourself ! Paul ! This is Paul Forrester . My new assistant . Brian Willis , he owns this place . Hello ! New assistant , huh ? Man , keep you mitts off the sawbones . Brian ? What ? I 'll take you round the back and show you your cargo . I 'll only be a minute . You know , you assistant is not a bad looking guy . I hope he got some references . Not one ! Jealous ? No ! Should I be ? He works cheap , Jeanie ran off on me . You know , I got the obvious solution to you being broke and shot-handed all the time . Oh yeah ? What 's that ? Marry me ? I 'll pay all the bills if you keep your opinions to yourself about my program . It 's just a thought . Come on , Joey ! Give me a break , would you ? My Dad 's expecting me to write a ... a book report on this financed week . Keep the usual records on these chicks . Size , weight ... You 'll get the regular boarding fee . Casey ! There 's a falcon back there in a cage , looks like Waldo but it had something on his head . Who 's Waldo ? A falcon with a broken wing . Casey is gonna fix it . A peregrine ? Aha . Any identification ? No . I assume , the fool that I am , that you were gonna tell me about it ! What ? So you can bring it here and put it in a cage with all the other ones ? Stick under a microscope ? Poke around ? See if you can prod it into mating ? You know that 's not how it is , Case . She 's a peregrine ! You know what that means ? It means to wander ! That 's what she was born to do ! She can 't live locked up ! When she 's well if she can be returned to the wild ! She will be . Oh yeah , I know that little trick of yours , that 's why you put a little transmitter on her foot ? So you can find her nest and then steal her eggs ? How would you like it Paul if you came one day , and find somebody had swiped your kid ? Hey , wait a minute ! I didn 't create this mess . I 'm the guy that 's trying to make it better ! How ? She 's a wild creature , Brian ! You can 't do this to her ! It 's cruel , it 's ugly ! Tomorrow , Casey . I 'm coming for the bird . He 's gonna take Waldo from you and bring her here ? She 's a peregrine , she 's on the endangered species list . Where have you been ? Don 't you know anything about this ? Not much . You got a feeling for Waldo , use your imagination . How do you think you 'd do locked behind bars ? With people watching you , examining every move you made , You think you could make love , have babies , raise a family under conditions like that ? How 's my boy ? What do you say we go inside and roast you up some dinner ? - No ! - Oh , come on ! We gotta get out of here . Why ? Fox is here in town . I saw him on the street today . He could be going from house to house for all we know . Alright , then we 'll leave in the morning . In the morning ? - Dad ! We can 't ... . - In the morning ! Shhhhhh ! You wanna got back out there , don 't you ? To be free ? To race against the sky ... Me too . Our troubles aren 't so different , are they ? Who are you really ? I 'm a photographer . I saw what you did with that silver ball in your hand , the blue light . I couldn 't let Waldo go back to that place , to that cage . There 's no way that bird could 've flown so soon . What did you do ? You wouldn 't understand , Casey . I 'll try ! Just tell me something , none of this makes any sense . It 's just energy . You don 't fuse a broken bone in two seconds with energy . It 's like heat . Heat ? From a steel ball ? There 's nothing on this earth that does nothing that I ... Don 't be afraid . When you said you wanted to go back out and race across the sky , you meant that . Who ? I mean ... What are you ? An endangered species . Like Waldo . Please , don 't run ! No ! No ! I won 't hurt you ! Take this . Don 't worry . Now look at me . Here . Scott and I will go . Now I know why they 're after you . You know about that ? The Chief said something . Why didn 't you tell him about us ? I don 't know . Maybe it was the way you cared about that falcon . Morning ! Morning ! Is this alright ? Sure ! Thanks ! You want coffee ? Yes I do , I want it black , An by the way , I 'm looking for a couple of people , I was thinking that maybe help me ... Go on ! Take your break , I 'll get them . Thanks ! Alright . Good morning ! What 'll be ? Everything looks good . Cantaloupe 's hard . Well , I guess I want have the Cantaloupe . Coffee 'll be fine . Now I wonder if you could tell me , have you seen these two individuals recently ? Either one of them ? Well , No , not that I ... No , I haven 't seen them . - Are you sure ? - Yeah ! Sorry . - Coffee ? - Black . Case ... I 'm sorry we keep butting heads about this thing . Look , I 've been flying birds because 15 ye ... The falcon isn 't here , Brian . What ? I was checking it out in the yard this morning and ... I guess the restraint came loose . What the hell are you talking about ? It just flew away ! Nothing I could do about it . You said it had a broken wing ! I must have been mistaken . Mistaken ? You let it go , didn 't you ? - Brian , please . - Look ! Oh , you take the cake , you know that ? You can 't get me to change my mind about captive breeding , so your next move is sabotage ? You don 't understand ! You 're damn right I don 't understand ! If this was anybody but me , Casey , you 'd be in serious trouble now . Casey didn 't let Waldo go . I did ! I guess now chivalry isn 't dead , is it ? I 'm sorry Mister , Casey 's gonna have to take her own heat on this one . Brian , wait ! It 's the truth . I let the bird go . I don 't care who held the door open , she 's responsible . I saw the cage you had the other falcon in . You don 't know much about captive breeding , do you Mr Forrester ? Maybe you ought to learn something about it before you start sabotaging what we are trying to do here . I don 't think things should be put into cages . This may surprise you , Mister but neither do I ! It 's just that right now it happens to be necessary . What about the hood on its eyes so it couldn 't see ? It 's juts used to keep the bird calm . Let me explain this to you . We keep records of where the nests are located . And we take the eggs out of the nest , back to the foundation where they hatch . We hand-feed the bids for a few weeks , and put them back in the nest where they belong . Why do you take the eggs ? Because the DDT that they used to use around here , made the egg shell so thin , they break very easily . In 1970 there were two pair of peregrines left , Two . Today there are 76 pair , 152 birds , Now , without captive breeding or other recovery methods your Waldo wouldn 't exist at all . Even if she did , she 'd be the last one of her kind . Look , think about it . The last one like her on the planet , and when she died , there would be anymore . Ever . So that means you 're half like him . I don 't know what 's keeping me from running into the streets and screaming that the Martians have landed . He 's not a Martian . Well , you know what I mean . He wouldn 't hurt anything . What do they do if they catch him ? Put him in a cage . Me too , I guess . I wish we could stay . Dad ? Got the stuff . Where are we headed ? Dad ? There are an awful lot of things I don 't know yet . I think I just made a mistake . Welcome to the human race . Alright , you guys ! Stay right where you are ! Harold ? What are you doing ? You lied to me , Case , why did you do that ? You said you hadn 't seen them ! We haven 't done anything wrong ! That might be true , son , but there 's a fellow from the Federal Security Agency that seems to think different . Harold ? They don 't mean any harm ! Now , you stay where you are , Casey . We don 't know how dangerous these boys might be . Yes , I do ! How ? I just do . Please , Harold . Great , woman 's intuition , alright , Mister . Slow and easy , assume the position . What position ? Don 't be funny ! Hands on the car and spread them ! Alright , boys , get in my car . Let 's go . All I wanna do is visit Mona Jean and I 'm stuck with a man and half a pecker wood . What a way to spend the Sunday . Dennis ! This is Chief Galley , Patch me through to that fellow Fox at the Shirlum Motel , will you ? You got it , Chief . Fox isn 't answering , Chief , would you like to leave a message ? Yeah , Leave word I called , tell him I got his two suspects in custody . and that I 'll meet him at the station . Move that rear end of yours , Mona Jean , like you never did before ! That a girl ! Mona ? Mona Jean ! Where you going like that , girl ? Hold on , Baby ! Come on , sweet heart ! Come on baby , come to Daddy ! Come on ! I can 't believe that dog ! Mona ? Hold on ! Mona Jean ! Come on , sweet heart ! Mona Jean ! Mona Jean ! I told you once , I told a thousand times , raw meat will upset your stomach ! What do you do ? You go running off like you 've never even seen a hamburger , before . Oh , oh ... Why did you help us get away ? I guess I couldn 't stand the idea of you being in a cage . I can 't believe I 'm doing this , I must be crazy . Turn up here , Casey . This road . What for ? I shouldn 't have let Waldo go . You don 't have time to worry about that now . We gotta get you out of here . Casey . What happened ? Now , I had them , Mr Fox , I swear I did ! I had them locked right up in my unit , and the next thing I knew , well ... I don 't believe it . I cannot believe it , you left them alone . Mona Jean was running toward the pond chasing a piece of meat . Well , she might have drowned or something . You left them alone to chase a dog ? Mona Jean ... Look , if Brian got to you somehow , then just ... He explained things to me that I didn 't know . He was right and I was wrong . Just turn that falcon back into the wild so she can decide her own fate ! I was proud of you for that ! So was I but we were wrong , Casey . Both of us . I think I understand something now . Well , what separates human beings from animals and birds , if a man makes a mistake , he can ... . go back and try to fix it . I think that 's what Brian 's trying to do . Casey ! What the hell is going on ? Take good care of it , Brian . How did you get this bird to come back to you ? Well ... She likes me ! She likes you ? Good-bye , Casey . Do I get a kiss ? I don 't know ! Brian said to keep the mitts off the sawbones ! I 'll send that government man on a wild goose chase . I 'll tell him you 're going white water rafting , how 's that ? Where will you really go ? We 're peregrines too , aren 't we , Scott ? I guess we 'll just wander . Now , does this mean you 've changed your mind about captive breeding ? Well , let 's just say I have a ... . new perspective about what it means to be an endangered species . I guess he was planning on stealing the truck all along . We 'll probably find it abandoned up in the hill some place . Oh , yes , I 'm sure you will . He didn 't happen to say anything at all about where they might be headed ? Oh , I , I remember ... the boy was bugging his Dad about doing some white water rafting . They were making plans . Planning on taking a little vacation , were they ? Yeah , I guess so . Well , thank you for your time . Chief ? Scott , what 's a wild goose chase ? Well , it 's when you send somebody some place you know you 're not going to be . You think George Fox knows what a wild goose chase is ? I 'm sure he does ! Why ? That story that Casey is going to tell him about us going white water rafting , If I was George Fox , I don 't think I 'd believe it . What are you talking about ? How would you like to go white water rafting ? Oh ! Fantastic ! Scott ? Yeah ? What is white water rafting ? Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * *

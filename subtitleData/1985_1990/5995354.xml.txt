 Professor . Oh , you startled me . I 'm sorry , Professor . That 's quite a storm out there . I guess it is . So this is it ? That 's it . A duplicating machine . If it really works , Professor . It will be one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind . Ah , ha . Let 's see if it does work first . Are you ready ? Ah , it 's , it 's square , it 's white , doesn 't smell ? I don 't understand what went wrong here . It was your first attempt , Professor , you 'll work the bugs out . I thought I had it all figured out . I have no idea what went wrong . Are you alright , Superboy ? I 'm fine . My God , look at it , Superboy . A duplicate of you . Sort of . It 's uncanny . He looks so ... Bizarre . Bizarro ? You call me Bizarro ? He can talk . Bizarro . I said he was bizarre . Even his hearing is defective . Is he like me ? An imperfect you . Definately not human . Where am me ? Who am you ? I 'm Superboy . Why you dressed like me ? Superboy . The duplicating machine . Never mind . It 's part of both of us . How me get here ? This duplicating machine , it created you . This machine , it make me ? It was an accident . Me accident ? No . That 's not what he meant . Me no accident . This machine no good . Me go ! I can 't let you go . Me go ! What have I done ? What have I created ? I 've got to stop him . But he 's got all your powers . With that warped mind of his , there 's no telling what damage he might do . Look at my machine . I don 't know how I 'll ever get this fixed . Do what you can here , Professor . I 'll contact you when I find him . If I find him . Ah , people , me make friends . How are you ? Look , Mom , Superboy ! Hello , little boy . Hold me , Mommy , look at his face . Keep away ! Keep away ! Me no monster , me Bizarro . Uh , what is it ? Very ugly dress you are wearing . - Ah . - Me like it a lot . Why you scream ? Me Bizarro , me friend . Why me do different from Superboy ? Must be glass . Glass no good . That isn 't Superboy . Me Bizarro . Me just like Superboy , almost . I don 't have disguise . That must be problem . Ah , me remember now . Me have lots to learn , me go to college . Yes , Officer , yes , that does help . He was seen at the corner of Orange and Cyprus around ten ? OK . I 'll call back . Nice costume , Clark . Gee , I barely recognise you . Where is your costume . The party starts in a little while . Oh , gee . The costume party . Um , I was studying all night in the library and I forgot . You 're my date , remember . Ah , I 'm your date . [ phone rings ] Hello ? This is Professor Peterson . I 'm trying to contact Superboy . I might be able to get to him . Tell him I have some terrible news . I 'm calling him about my experiment . Tell him he 's got to come to my lab as soon as he can . Yes , I 'll relay the message . So I take it I 'm going alone , huh ? I , I had a little problem last night , um ... I kind of messed up when I ironed my costume . I was hoping you 'd understand . Oh , I understand , Clark . I understand that I just don 't make plans with you anymore . Yeah , Clark , I mean , first you don 't come home at all last night , now you don 't have a costume for the party . I 'm really sorry , Andy , but I really appreciate you guys understanding . I don 't understand . I don 't understand . You know , sometimes I can 't figure him out . If I didn 't know better I 'd think he 's living a double life . Yeah , maybe he 's a CIA agent . Yeah , right . Lana , what say we slam some beers and do the wild thing . I 'll meet you at the party , OK ? OK . Now , no-one know my secret . Me look just like Kent Clark . Me go where he lives and be with friends . Andy and Lana . What ? Hi , me am Kent Clark and me your good friend . Clark ? Who else ? Of course , me Kent Clark . You sly dog ! You faked all that with the costume and you snuck out and changed into that mask , great . How 'd you put that on ? You not Superboy . Why you wear costume ? Oh , I get it . Play along . Listen , buddy , it 's getting late , we 've got to amscram . Coming ? You want me go with you ? You 're great . Andy , why you not fly to party ? Oh , Clark , quite the comedian . Have to admit . I never expected it . You 've come out of the closet , ah . Why me be in closet ? - It just exploded ? - Yeah . There 's got to b e a reason . I think it 's got something to do with the unstable properties of any non-living thing matter created by my machine . What your saying is this , Bizarro creature is a walking time bomb ? I haven 't had time to do all the calculations yet but I think the size has a direct bearing on the length of time before self-detonation . Are you telling me I have to destroy him ? Or at least put him out of commission . But he 's like a part of me . Like something I never had . A brother . I can 't kill him . He 's not really alive . I guess I 'll have to use something that I was hoping I wouldn 't . - What ? - Kryptonite . The one thing that can destroy me . Destroy us . Hi , Clark . Hey , Clark . That was a really cool white mask you had on . White mask ? Didn 't I just see you leave with Andy ? Excuse me . Well , Clarke , what did I tell ya . All the girls from Beta Fi are here . What a costume ! What costume ? Golly , Clark . Nice line . Andy , why you laugh so much ? Well , I guess it 's just the kind of guy I am . Ow , did you pad D that ? Come on , let 's go some eats . Hey , you should be glad Clark couldn 't make it to the party today . Otherwise you wouldn 't get the chance to be here with me . I wish you would stop picking on him . He really is a great guy . Yeah . Yeah , that 's what you keep telling me . Hey , Lana , look who I found . Clark ? That am my name . I can 't believe it . Look , if you didn 't want to come with me you could 've just told me , instead of making me think you weren 't coming at all . You know Bizarro coming ? Bizarro ? What 's with this bizarro stuff ? Is this your idea of a joke ? I 'm not laughing . I think you owe me an apology . Me not sorry . Will you please stop talking in that stupid voice ! Why waste your time on a dip like him ? Come on , let 's dance ! Do you mind ? She my girl . You go . Yeah , right , wimp . You leave now . Yeah , Clark , didn 't think you had it in ya , buddy . You butting in on something smart guy ? No , no , I 'm okay . Me teach manners . Hey , I 'm really sorry . What is he doing ? Did you see that ? Look at him . You people are crazy . Me do good , yes ? I can 't believe you just did that , what has gotten into you ? You know , you really could have hurt him ? How could you do this ? Because I like you . You my girl . Stop it ! Just stop it ! I don 't know what this is all about but I don 't like it . Then me make you very happy , right ? That stupid mask of yours . Gee , I don 't think you used all the right moves . Lana slap me . That must be love . Love is very strange . Lana . I go to her . I can 't fly as Kent Clark . Me change first . Ah , now me go after Lana . Why , why you go ? You are not Superboy . Who are you ? Time to come on date . What are you talking about ? What are you doing ? Put me down ! I said put me down ! Bizarro . Put her down . She my girl now . We young and in love . Bizarro , you 've got to let her go . Please , listen to him . Bizarro , look . I 've brought something for you . What this ? For me ? I 'm afraid so . What you doing , Superboy ? Pretty green colour . It 's very nice . What ? It doesn 't weaken you ? Bizarro no want . Here , you play with it . You 're killing him . Don 't you understand , we 've got to get that rock away from him . It present for Superboy . No problem , he fine . Lana , Bizarro , we go . No , we 've got to help Superboy ! Bizarro , stop it ! Stop it ! Captioned by Grant Brown

 In the federal building in Los Angeles His name was Brick Tyler a man of steel . Literally . Right Brick ? Brick : Something like that . right ? Gaurd : Anyway the guys from camp David tell me that you turned down the throws . Brick : Yeah . Men envied him . Women desired him . Do you live here in L.A. ? Brick : Washington . I 'm on my way to the airport now . hmm ? but the blonde had more than lipstick in her purse . it can 't be . It isn 't me . He was bionic . A brutal realization Dear god I 'm wired ! And only one man could save him Dr. Billy Hayes . hah hah Those wild and crazy scientific guys â€” I love ' em those Misfits ... Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! They brought him to humanidyne . That 's where Hayes hangs out . He was less than thrilled . Billy : Mr. Perfect needs help ? women and country needs help from me ? I know you 've had some problems ... Billy : Problems Richard ? El and I practically rebuilt the guy from scratch . He doesn 't see him to say thank you . Chow mein and chance . Here 's your ticket - Oh fab ! you Know Billy I know you and he were friends in college . Were . ok ? You 're never gonna win if you buy just one ticket . Ok ? Hayes was a gambler . A born risk taker . El : More Lottery tickets ? You spent money on more lottery tickets ? will ya ? The rent is due on Monday and I 've got my half . And I 'll have mine too . El . Okay ? The odds are that 1 in every 100 tickets there 's a 1 / 70 shot that there 's gonna be a payoff . hundred tickets . ( Miss Nance Screams ) He knew that scream could only mean on thing . How much ? Five Grand ! Breathe on that will ya ? Do I deserve a day like this ? he needs you . El : If he 's talking about Brick Tyler he 's right . this guy has completely blocked out the fact that part of him is bionic . Billy : Just the way he blocked out that someone had to catch those passes when he set the conference record ? Dick : Oh I don 't think he meant to .. Billy : Forget me ? Richard I don 't think you understand this guy . there 's Chinese out front if you want it . ok ? and his pepsident smile . on the inside ... . - El : Billy ... . Billy : On the inside he 's a big phony . please . Well let me tell ya something . If Mr. Macho wants me to help him out this time he 's gonna have to personally come ... . Brick : I 'm sorry Billy . That voice could only belong to one human being . Brick ! I didn 't mean for you to ... Everything you said is right . Brick : I apologize . ( sighs ) I 've been a jerk . That 's not entirely true . At least ya - Hayes . huh ? It was a job for a precision team . precise . Billy : Wrench . Billy : Clamp Brick : This isn 't me . Billy : And I think you oughtta be glad about that . Let me have one of those little wirey fuse things . It 's all you . Brick : It 's you and El . It was just like when you use to make all those great catches in college . It wasn 't my passing . I was a lousy passer . Frankly Hayes was glayed Brick was finally admitting that it was his catching that helped Brick set the conference record . Brick : All the great things I could do with my arm . I could - I could - But apparently Brick had forgotten the fact that he was Bionic as well . Eleven point four million dollars worth . It was a hard thing to forget . forget about the car accident . Billy : Or how we put you back together Brick . I mean you spent a lot of time on this table . Soldering gun . What 's the de- - do you think you could- - - El : Good . - Billy : great . I don ; t know . After a while it all seemed so ... Natural I- - I - I figured my new arobics workout It 's obvious that Brick has had some problems adjusting . Penny Glue . Brick : And Now ... Now I .. I really screwed up . I fumbled on the one . fumbled ? Big Wrench . Johnny : Football Hayes . Billy : Football ... The football is the nickname for the portable communications center the President carries with him . in the event of a nuclear war . his portable button . You mean that 's how ... I mean that 's what happened .. with a chainsaw . He 's gonna sell it to a terrorist group tomorrow . Uncle Sam 's calling . Where we going ? Glamorous women and deadly men . The men who sawed the football off Brick were there to turn it over to the international arms dealer that hired them . He was set up by the private gambling club . just outside of town . a place for the high rollers of the world . Chainsaw and his buddy weren 't there to gamble . but they certainly got more than they bargained for . People get hurt in the spy business . It 's a high stakes game and Hayes knew it . On thought kept playing itself over and over in his mind as they landed in Nice What the Hell were they doing here . I mean what if this arms dealers sells the football to these terrorists ? I mean - and they come up with the code to activate it ? we could be talking the big boom here ! Year round skiing . Nuclear Winter . Am I right ? El : Now he 's beginning to understand . what I 'm beginning to understand is that this is a job for a government agent . Johnny : He is a Government agent . Billy : Wait . S 'cuse me . B-Man . But Brick happens to be a mentally unstable ego maniac with Bionic limbs Johnny : That he 's too freaked to use . ok ? I hung out in the desert for three years because I couldn 't deal with my weirdness . It 's not an easy thing to beat . and if he needs our help I 'm gonna give it to him . El : We 're gonna give it to him . by doing a top secret mission ? Top Secret " I can 't even believe I 'm saying those words ! We built Brick 's Bionics . We know weird . Now the government psychiatrists believe that the best thing for Brick to do is just to get back out in the field . to correct what he thinks screwed up right ? Well I just hope you guys know what this is doing to him . Cause we 're talking an ego the size of Godzilla isn 't it pal ? you don 't want to help him . I didn 't say that . You didn 't have to . let me see if I can remember what you taught me on the plane . Nousee Viola Que 'll ville Magnifique Brick : " C 'est Bon C 'est Beret That 's good . I have a good teacher . El : Let 's see about rental cars . uh ... One red hot Ferrari and a silver volks wagon . why don 't I look for the red hot Ferrari - Ferrari 's yours . I think that 's it down there . I don 't - I don 't - I 'd feel better i-i-if I know . That 's all right man . the Bricker 's feeling a little unsure of himself right now and maybe he 'd feel better riding in som - El : The Ferrari 's Bricks . Billy . look why don 't you ride with Brick and you can practice your french we 'll follow you to the hotel . N 'est pas Billy El : Van 's over here . Billy : Oh yeah ? Oh Yeah Glo ? I know what that meant you know . You wanna tell me what she meant ? wasn 't it ? I mean I know enough French to know that . So what she say ? El : " The cabbage is green Billy : I was close . isn 't that the betty from the plane ? I 'll just kinda .. go .. and Johnny : Gloria ! It was a close call with a dangerous blonde . Welcome to the French Riveria El : You guys alright ? Johnny : Looks like somebody 's already got our number . the way you pushed that - - Glo : I didn 't do anything . you pushed the car .. Hey hey ! Bricker ! you almost got sacked . I - I didn 't - uh .. Sure you did ! You were great ! Was he great ? ( All confirming ) I can 't remember . I must have blacked ou - Are you sure ? ok ? All pro moves . What was that big explosion ? Big back fire . Boom . No kidding . I did do ok . Yeah ! Building Brick 's confidence . That 's why they were there . And it rubbed Hayes wrong . The agency put them in the smallest rooms in the hotel . that 's life . But Mr. Secret Agent got ... Nous have the grande suite de larger por Monsiouer Tyler . got it . Brick Brick : Not bad . but after that little run in with the blonde but I could use a hot shower . Look ! A fruit basket . maybe you should leave it alone Glo I think after our little run in with the blonde we 're not to welcome here . Brick : I think it 's ok Johnny B. That 's the way Oscar usually sends his insrtuctions . El : That 's a video tape ? Brick : Oscar likes to send the latest developments via satellite . Someone better take care of " Ze belleman " First . I got it . I don 't think that 's what he expected . Brick : ooo K So this is what it was all about . Secret instructions on microtape . Like he 'd been here before . Billy : Anyone else feel a little like Peter Graves ? well I geuss that about covers it . I - I put the tape in backwards . El : Give me that . That 's ok . I don 't think these do . Welcome to the French Riveria . See ? No problem . ( Garbled ) ... Chateau LaSheen ... look . Just listen . that 's the arms dealer . ... Chateau at 4 o 'clock this afternoon ... . So the deal is going down at four O 'clock at the chateau . ... Yellow Turban ... . right we got that . ... Very dangerous ... I think we 'd all agree on that . ... kill volve ... . ... to death ... . I don 't like the sound of this . I 'm sorry to have to break that to you . Richard here has something to say . I just wanted to say that knowing now what we know now ... I would call you back .. I really would . I think this is probably all for the best . I ju- - Be careful . this is very very dangerous now . Just don 't do anything stu - Narrator : Don 't do anything stupid . Well that left them all pretty depressed . Knowing what we know now ? Glo : Very very dangerous . What do ya suppose he meant by that ? We 'd have known if I wouldn 't have screwed up the tape . He was right . And they all knew it . you can 't mess up the tape by putting it in backwards . It was probably my electricity that screwed it up . You really think so ? Hayes was thrilled to see Brick 's confidence building . Does anyone know what time it is in LA ? No one 's in the lab yet . We have about an hour before .. I know . I know . I think we ought to be optimistic about this . huh ? and we know there are two dead guys in this closet . about this spy business ... or what ? Brick : They 're the guys that stole it . I 'm sure . El : Which means someone stole it from them or they don 't have a very nice boss . Glo : This is a threat isn 't it ? whoever did this is threatening to kill us . That 's probably what Richard and Mr. Oscar were trying to tell us . ok ? Glo : Carried away ? Billy these two guys are dead . Isn 't that the guy from the tape ? It was the guy from the tape and it looked like it was up to Hayes to confront him . Billy : Yes . Tape guy : Lovely day for Baccarat Right . The opening salvos had been fired . You could have cut the tension with a knife . there are many people around here who play for keeps . I 'll - I 'll remember that . It was a witty reply . One that put him on the run . There was no doubt in anyone 's mind who came out on top . Now I 'd say that was a threat . shouldn 't we follow him ? Glo : Are you crazy ? We don 't have to . We know where he 's going . The Chateau was a high class gambling establishment on the outskirts of town . The parking lot was filled with Roll Royces ' Mercedes ' new red Ferrari 's . He wasn 't sure how the other misfits felt But Billy Hayes was right at home . Billy : Park it where you can see it . about the sneakers . Glo : ( scoffs ) If Johnny B can wear his then I can wear mine . Might as well die in comfort . Billy : This things driving me crazy . look . The deal goes down in 15 minutes . so let 's keep our eyes open for the guy we met in the hall . and let 's see if we can find a guy in a yellow turban . That shouldn 't be a problem . so the yellow turbans are a little more common than I thought . Billy. there he is . It was the mustache from the hotel . Hayes had him nailed . why don 't I - - Brick : Bill ! I think we need someone a little more experienced . got the point ? It was a terrible idea . you know - - Glo : Billy good idea Brick . why don 't you and Glo check out Mr. Mustache at the roulette table and we 'll just stay here and play it safe . Tu vien ? Me Oui Brick : " Me Oui . " That 's good . but French was getting on his nerves . I 'm OK. it 's ok . are you ok ? I 'm picking up a lot of juice in here . find a place to unload a few amps ? ok ? we 're gonna cruise around and look for a little yellow turban action . What are you gonna do ? There was no doubt in Hayes ' Mind . I 'm gonna play it safe with the dangerous blonde . Billy . tell me you 're not gonna gamble . you gotta gamble to sit down . Not your rent . Oscar gave us a little extra cash I 'm keeping in a separate pocket . - Alright . - Ok ? When you lose the cash that Oscar gave you I 'm not gonna lose the cash . that 's it . That 's it . - The rent 's due on Monday . - Right . I Promise . Promise ? Promise . Okay ? Can I go now ? Brick : M 'sieur Roulette was for sissies . Everyone in the French Riviera knew that the real game was Baccarat . Maybe your luck has changed since this morning . is it safe to sit here ? I don 't see any trucks . It was an opening that was as smooth as an eighty year old cognac . She could tell at once that Hayes knew what he was doing . looks like Mr. Mustache is conducting business with one of those yellow towel heads . Right . Let 's check it out . huh ? No time now . You should have gone before . I 'll try to hold it . Monsieur . The minimum wage at this table is 500 . He was trying to throw Hayes . Five hundred ? But Billy was the picture of cool . Right . I knew that . I knew that . While Hayes counted out my chips Other people had their eyes on the guy in the yellow turban . Seems all of the players are here . Pardon me ? tonight . Guess they are . what do you suppose he meant by that ? Let 's follow him and find out . Mustache was on the move . And Hayes was having trouble coming up with the bets . would you like to play at another table ? No . uh . I 've got plenty in the other pocket . He left Hayes no choice . He had to go for the rent . so I think I should do it . ( Laughing ) Excuse me M 'Sieur . May I see your pass ? I must 've left it back in my hotel room . Well we can only admit players to the cellars with passes or large stakes to gamble . Exactly what would you consider large ? 000 US Dollars . I think we might be a little short . The cellar was for High stakes gambling . Hayes was doing a little of that on his own . ( French ) M 'siuer . It was a game of easy come and easy go . Billy : S 'cuse me . Is that it ? M 'siuer care to play another hand ? No . no . maybe a little later . Hayes figured that one month 's rent was enough to lose in one night . my luck is improving . I need some money . Glo : Join the club . the mustache man just went into the cellar . that 's where the high stakes gambling is . You need two hundred grand to get in . huh ? Coming up with two hundred grand seemed impossible . until the Hayes Brain came up with a brilliant idea . in the corner . - Sure. excuse me . - s 'cuse me . ok ? I gotta move some juice . we gotta find out what this guy is up to . El . El : Oh man . Look. self control just hold it . there he is . Come on . Let 's go . No I 'm not going to do it . It 's cheating . It 's not cheating . It 's manipulating for your country . and since when is manipulating for the country cheating ? Billy . Glo . I 'll give all the money back . No one takes home a thing . think of it like a confidence builder for Brick . I mean he doesn 't have to know how he 's winning . the blonde 's going in there right now . we gotta move now . but we don 't keep a penny . Not - Not a dime . Some promises are meant to be kept . others ? What 's he doing ? He 's getting some kind of food tray together . will you stop that ? I can 't go . I gotta unload . It can 't wait ? No . Ok . Not here . I 'll go around the corner . Strange weather . While B-man was relieving himself the rest of the gang was at the roulette wheel upstairs . Hayes kept wondering if using Glo this way was a good idea . ( french ) It was a wonderful idea . Brick : Now what is that ? we 're up fifty grand . Brick : No No No No No I 'm the man . with the hot hand . ok ? What Gloria didn 't know wasn 't going to hurt her . Glo : We got enough ? Billy : We got enough . Glo : Let 's go . Boy am I on . I 'm on . just great . Thank you sir . Nice going Bricker . Max . but next time you don 't have to be so obvious ok ? m 'siuer we can allow the lady but no more . I don 't think you under ... . Brick : Oh I think we can handle it . Bill Boy ... you enjoy yourself while you 're waiting . Entree Gloria Bill Boy ? Hayes hated that . I 'm probably gonna kill him . Don 't you think you 're being a little hard on Billy ? Oh he can take . He always has . let 's uhm ... let 's look around . See what we can find . While Brick and Glo were enjoying themselves in the wine cellar Hayes was doing some heavy negotiating up top . well what if I give you four pink ones and a green one . Mustache : It is time . What 's he waiting for ? it 's Billy . what 's he doing with the mustache ? Mr. Potato head led Billy outside to the yellow turban on the patio . It looked like they were giving him a little party . Hayes ! It was a close call and all of them knew it . I 'm beginning to think Brick erased a little bit more of that tape than we thought . They could only guess what was in store for them now . The Chateau had more surprises than a fun house on the fourth of July . But Mr. Mustache and the turban had one more . Billy ; You guys are government agents ? Why didn 't you tell us ? but uh you did not answer . Probably on the Tape that Oscar sent . and the girl I tried again with them at the roulette wheel but he never answers passwords anyway . wait a minute . You know Brick ? The bionic Jerk . Yes . We back him up over here . he get 's himself in the Jam and we have to bail him out . And I will give you one guess who gets all the credit in Washington . Brick treated everyone the same way . Sorry I was so hard on you Hayes . and then it dawned on him . Wait a minute . He 's in the Cellar right now with Gloria . get your buns in there . the deal is about to go down . and the bozo is in charge . You guys ok ? They were gone . Gotta be back here somewhere . I 'd feel better if the other guys were here . Brick : Relax I 'm back up to speed . perfectly capable of handling this myself Brick 's confidence was dangerously out of control . but his luck was still holding . if it could just last long enough for Hayes and the guys to get to the cellar . can you give me a break with the glasses . - alright . - sigh I want you to know I feel really ridiculous in this . It 's the only way we 're all gonna get in there . Listen if you feel ridiculous just think how El feels . Got enough air in there stretch ? just once I would like for one of you to ha - you 're right . I feel better . They knew they had to hurry . It was four O 'clock and the deal was going down . Dealer : Does it meet with your approval ? Terrorist : It does . and you have to taken care of the government man ? They will not be giving us any problem . A chance to blackmail the world with nuclear war . It was costing the terrorists plenty . Brick was all ears . What are you doing ? Listening . Glo : What are you listening to ? Getting into the cellar was easy this time . men of the world . ( french ) Le Merci What are you listening to ? Brick : Shhhh Dealer : The Diamonds are Beautiful . We have a deal . Narrator : His Bionic ear left no doubt where they could be . Glo : Don 't understand it . I can 't hear a thing . Brick : In there . How do you know ? I have very good hearing . He did have good ears but not much in between them . Sort of like a friend of his upstairs . Putting on a heavy accent : I don 't think you want to do that . El : Bonjour . I 'll be back . Billy : Glo ! Hayes : Brick . Get the football . Hayes gave him one last chance . Hayes ; Brick ! Get the football man ! Hayes : Do it ! good going Bricker . I 'll catch up . let 's go . has anyone seen him ? Waiter : Hold it . Hayes : Thanks big guy. let 's roll . It was the college football team yell . Hayes knew they were in trouble . El : Where does he think he 's going ? Hayes ; For a bionic touch down . take your shoes come on let 's go . scuse us I have your chopper waiting by the peak outside of town . Where 's Johnny B ? Get them ! Mustache : Where 's the football ? Brick ! there he was playing college fight songs in his head . as he ran for the bionic touch down . Brick was headed for the uprights . leaving his team behind once again . - This time - Come on let 's go . Hayes wasn 't going to let him . come on . I think I 'm faster on foot . I 'll meet you there . Now tell me about this . Johnny : Brick ! But Tyler wasn 't listening . He thought there was no way they could catch him . He was wrong . you were planning on leaving the team behind were ya ? Touchdown . get in . Johnny ; You heard the man . but he wasn 't happy . Now what the hell are you doing ? I had it aced . Glo : What are we doing ? Tu ne ca imbecille Was that about me ? Are you calling me an idiot ? Him . so were the misfits . The guys from the casino had called the police . you got a bolt ? my pleasure . Woah ! Shooting Tex ! But Brick just couldn 't accept the idea that he screwed up . I was the one that saved you from the car and I was the one that won the money that got us into the vault and I was the one that got the football . Now I 'm an idiot ? It was the wrong thing to say to Johnny B. No you 're a stupid idiot . jerk . We did . You ? Glo moved the car with telepathy . the same with the ball at the roulette wheel And I took the rap for the tape you screwed up . and we all got the football out . Why didn 't you tell me ? We were trying to build up your confidence Brick . you just freaked out . Yes I did . Brick was finally beginning to understand the root of his problem . uh .. - From Bionics . - Or from people ? How ' bout those government agents ? You knew them . I always do . That 's not what they said . It was just like on the football field . and like everything else in Brick 's life . What 's the matter with me ? if you 're ever gonna change you 're gonna have to learn to be a team player bud . look . It was the chopper . Our only problem was how to get up to it . hang on ! it was worth a try . - Billy : Come on ! - Glo : We 'll never make it ! can you do a run ? Johnny : No way I 'm tapped . B-Man was out of juice . They were pinned down . then I hit you in the corner . It was their best play in college but .. we can 't trust ya . we can 't leave you . The company can bail me out of jail . we gotta go . Give me a chance to make the team Billy . Please . Maybe Hayes was crazy . But he had to give him the shot . Billy ! Alright . - Go . - See you in LA . Football announcer : Well it 's a beautiful afternoon in Cougar Stadium everybody . ( Indistinct ) .. situation for the team . Here comes Tyler in from the sidelines with the play . Alright Go ! Go go GO ! Football announcer : Now both teams are lining up . This could be the final play of the day . The score is tied . extra lineman are being sent in to rush the passer . both teams are frantic . what are they gonna do ? looks like Tyler is ready to take the sack . Hayes meanwhile setting up wide . And the rush is on . Here 's Tyler breaking wide right now . but it looks like Tyler is gonna run long ! This is terrible ! He 's heading wide to the sideline while Hayes is wide open . Now Tyler is coming back in ! Yes ! Yes yes ! Now he 's gonna pass ! Tyler goes to work and lets fly a long long pass . looks like it could be tough though . Hayes has cleared the secondary . and it 's a touchdown ! the stadium is going wild . A perfect example of good teamwork . and it looks like Hayes is now being lifted in the air by his teammates . Yes ! that 's what 's happening . He appears to be waving down to Tyler . what a team those two make . Nice Pass Bricker . Nice pass . Announcer What a perfect team . A thriller finish to a hard fought game . No Billy . But it was one hell of a catch . Billy : Forget it Richard . Dick : But Brick said you were all so effective . Negative function . I 'm overloading here . I don 't see it how it 'll hurt every once in a while .. No ! no Richard no . It would mean so much to the ... Time for the two big C 's gang . Chinese and celebration . no lottery tickets ? No lottery tickets El . The gambling bug flew out the window . Ok we got Egg foo yung . How bout the rent ? Cause the landlord is on the phone . It 's coming in . Didn 't I tell you to trust me ? Chicken feet ? Somebody actually ordered chicken feet ? me . Dr. Hayes I called las Vegas . They 'll cash the chips . Chips ? the ones from the French Riviera . Do you have some to ? There 's a saying we have in the spy business . Loose lips sink ships . You didn 't win them at the roulette wheel . Did you Billy ? you know look . I got a little cleaned out when I was chasing the blonde . And you know with the rent due and - Tu et la lamla pucideo ( French Rambling ) Is she talking about me ? ( French Rambling . ) Glo ... I am so ashamed of you . oh no El . Really sorry stuff Hayes . I mean I just took them for souvenirs . Well I don 't have to cash them in you know . Ms. Nance .. lend me a couple hundred bucks to pay the rent ? It wasn 't exactly the heroes homecoming that agent Hayes expected . But hey . Life isn 't perfect . And there was still a question that had to be answered . Bricker Bricker You wanna give me the real reason why you never gave me credit for helping you win the passing title ? Girls . It made perfect sense . Girls . And with that finally settled the two old team mates sat down to lunch . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Misfits Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy Electric and alive Love you for your mind I can feel it ! straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies

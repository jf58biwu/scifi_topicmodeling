 Subtitles by Caradecuica . TUA 35 heavy , descend to 3,000 feet . Minneapolis center , this is Transuniversal 35 heavy descending to 3,000 . Roger , TUA 35 heavy . TUA 35 heavy , could you give me your location ? Ron , where the hell are we ? 25 miles due south on approach descending through 5,000 feet . 35 , what 's your current heading ? What 's his problem ? Minneapolis We 're currently heading ... TUA 35 , turn to heading ... Say again , Minneapolis . Jesus ! Down ! Oh , my god . Down ! Go down ! my god ! We hit them ! We hit them ! Minneapolis , this is TUA 35 declaring an emergency . We hit another aircraft . Looked like a 10 . 3 and 4 shutting down . Cutting fuel on 3 . We are going down . Repeat , we are going down . How much of the wing is gone ? Ron , see what 's left . Right . Mr. Smith , I 'm Kevin Bryley from Minneapolis . And you 're not doin ' your job . Shove these people in a room somewhere . Make no statement till I get back . Ashby , tell ' em what we need . Right . Move it . Come on , people . Let 's do it . Where 'd the DC-10 go down ? Ten miles south . Jerry , Eli , go take a look . Tom and I will put down here . Bill . Bill . With the flashlight over here . We were just going after the flight-data recorder . You want to do that next ? Sure . I 've been at the DC-10 site . Came down a lot harder than this one . What happened here ? He managed to get it leveled . But you might know there 's only three engines . One came down south of here . He lost a lot of wing ? We think so , yeah . We 've started on the site map . And the cops have finally stopped moving things around . Look , Bill , uh ... We 're being very careful , but we don 't think it 's a structural failure . Do you have any numbers yet ? Yeah , yeah . This one had 354 and 13 crew . The 10 had 265 and 11 . Watch that wing section there ! You already have the cockpit voice recorder ? Yeah , but it 's pretty battered . They 're working on it now . I want a dub made Before you send it out to Washington . Alright . I tell them . It might not be too good . It 's a silly rule . Why should the boys in Washington hear it first ? I got to hear what those poor bastards were up against , after they hit the 10 . I 'm sure they did their best . They always do . You are on Roger 's team ? I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer . I 'm the investigator in charge , Bill Smith . Bill Smith , yeah , I know . I 've read many of your crash reports . Naturally , I 've heard of you , doctor . What 's your interest here ? You want me to leave ? No . It doesn 't matter . All this just seems pretty far removed from your physics lab . Maybe scientists should leave the lab more often . They might learn things . Dr. Mayer ! What 's an ecology professor is doing on the crash site ? You know someone on the plane ? Not that I 'm aware of . How did you hear about the crash ? I got a call from the television . He 's the last guy I 'd expect to find here . Yeah , actually not . He 's been to several Midwest crashes . That big one in ' 79 at O 'Hare , he was all over it . I wonder why . I don 't think it will win him another Nobel prize . Over here ! I got it ! There 's a whole mob here from Boeing . And the man from McDonnell Douglas is on the way . Wes Lake from the FBI is here and the assistant D.A. from Ramsey County . OK , the usual gang . Mr. Janz , I 'm Bill Smith with the NTSB . Mr. Smith I 'm Raymond Leacock . I represent Mr. Janz . Is this a formal deposition ? Not yet . I 'm sitting in on this . Bill , meet Ian Carpenter . He 's with the air traffic controllers organization . Mr. Janz , I know this is hard for you . I want to hear what you saw and what your actions were . We were handling 40 flights , three of us . Plus the private planes . The screen was so crowded . Had a god damn headache . I was tired . 35 was coming in from the east . No , from the west . And 880 was coming in . Was that the 747 , Down ? I looked away for a moment ... some other situation . And when I looked back ... they 'd changed places . Oh ... I told 35 to turn . They were close , man . And then the numbers switched ... and you couldn 't tell them apart anymore . Somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . Well , that DC-10 was pretty public . It spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate . They don 't want people gawking at their , uh ... what did they call that crash in Florida ? Involuntary conversion . I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off . Yeah , well , they sure are busting their asses on this one . Look at that . They even got the ticket agents serving coffee . Mr. Keane . Where does this go ? What we gonna do with this stuff ? Did I tell you , you could touch that ? Excuse me . Put that down ! Just put that down ! Hey ! How about some coffee ? Hey , wait a minute ! I think she likes you , Bill . What did I do ? Could it be your breath ? I thought you always get that reaction . They 're ready to play the cockpit tapes . Minneapolis , we are currently heading zero ... TUA 35 , turn to heading ... Say again , Minneapolis . Jesus ! Down ! Oh , my god . Down ! Go down ! My God ! We hit them ! We hit them ! Minneapolis , this is TUA 35 declaring an emergency . We hit another aircraft . Looked like a 10 . 3 and 4 shutting down . Cutting fuel on 3 . We are going down . Repeat , going down ! How much of the wing is gone ? Ron , get back and see what 's left . Right . Would you like some coffee , Mr. Smith ? Damn ! I 'm listening ... is there anyplace to land ? Can you rewind that a little ? Still going down . Is there anyplace to land ? I 'll check for field . Just look for a flat place ... anything . We 'll be on the ground ... They are dead . They 're all dead ! What the hell is he talking about ? Sit down , Ron ! They 're dead , all of them . They 're burned up ! Jesus ! We 're going to hit ! Was that Kennedy shouting ? Yeah . Rockwell couldn 't understand him . Run that last part through again . I 'll see if I can clean it up a bit for you . Just look for a flat place ... anything . We 'll be on the ground ... They 're dead ! They 're all dead ! What the hell is he talking about ? Sit down , Ron ! They 're dead , all of them . They 're burned up ! Jesus ! Burned up ? They were going to be . They might as well have been dead already . It makes me sick . Yeah , but it doesn 't make sense . He 'd expected to make sense at a time like that ? No , not like that . Ok . How about the pilots ? Like they say , they 're the first on the scene of the accident . How many crash tapes have you heard ? God . Too many . How many times do you hear a man come apart like that ? Ok , but it 's got to happen sometime . He goes back there and sees all those people who will die . It 's too much for him . Obviously , they hadn 't burned up yet . What about if ... Maybe ... Maybe there was a fire in the cabin . Maybe they were burned up already . Sorry , but that won 't work . The fuselage was unaffected by fire until after impact . He just broke under the strain . Get me a transcript of that tape . Roger , set up a press conference for tonight . Let 's go see what the dead have to say about it . Is this gymnasium the biggest place they could find ? Oh Bill ! I 've got something interesting for you . These are pretty good bodies here . Next door , we got stuff from the DC-10 , which is mostly pieces . Can 't be identified . Next of Kin will have to look at personal effects mostly . Not many faces to show them . Then the FBI takes over . We 'll be lucky to tag 60 % from fingerprints and dental charts . Not enough hands , not enough heads . We autopsied the feel , and they died of trauma , dismemberment , burns , the usual . We got to get some ripper trucks in here to ... They 're on their way . We only got this place for two days . I got a dance ... The trucks will be here . OK ... Now here what I want you to see . Two kinds of watches ... Mechanics here and digital here . Now , these digital didn 't do so good . Mostly , they 're blank . Heat must wiped them out . But we did find this . Yeah . So what ? Take a closer look . It 's going backwards . This better not be a joke . It 's not . Somebody had a gag watch . Well , we thought of that . Look at this . Good evening . You all have copies of the prepared statement . I 'm William Smith , investigator in charge . I 'll try to answer your questions , but I warn you , we don 't know much more than is in that statement . Who wants to go first ? Sir , there 're been rumors of some type of a computer error being the cause of this crash . Can you confirm this ? That 's being looked at . I can 't say more at this time . When can we talk to the controller who was handling the planes ? You 'll have to take that up to the man 's lawyer . Mr. Smith ... you 're on record as issuing a pretty harsh indictment of the FAA for failing to require anti-collision devices on all commercial and private aircraft , even though , as you know , these devices have been available for over a decade . Would you care to comment ? Dr. Mayer , do you have any idea what caused this crash ? One of Newton 's laws , I suspect . The one about gravity . Beyond that I don 't know anymore than you do . Can I have an interview , doctor ? Gentleman , please . I have to get in there and ask some questions of my own . Would you care to reply to charge made by Mr. Carpenter ? No reply at this time . Next question . Mr. Smith , I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer , professor of physics at the University . I remember you . Thank you . My question has nothing to do with overloaded computers or negligent air traffic controllers . That should be refreshing . I doubt it . What unusual facts have you developed so far in your investigation ? I 'm not sure I know what you mean . Were there any unexplained observations ? Is there any indication this crash was caused by something less obvious than a computer overload ? None at all . Of course , every crash is unique . Yet they share common factors . There are things you expect to find and things you don 't . For instance , there is anything in the cockpit voice recorder out of the ordinary ? I can 't comment on that . It 's confidential . The relevant portions will be released in a couple of days . You can listen for yourself . All right . But is there anything else odd ? Have you found any unusual item in the wreckage , any discrepancies in the time sequence of the crash ? I 'm afraid I still don 't know what you 're driving at . I can 't be more plain without sounding like a fool . I 'm sampling looking for the inexplicable . I usually find it . Look , somebody made a mistake , and a lot of people died . In a few days we should be able to tell you what went wrong . There 's no mystery about it . Then I salute you . I 'll read your report with interest . All TUA personnel , please check with your supervisor for shift changes . So , is there anything else you need tonight ? I want the salvage team to work through the night . You got it . Better keep crew at the hangar , too . We might start getting all sort of ? . All right . It 's done . My secretary managed to get you a room at the Marriott . Tom , you 're staying at the Holiday Inn . Privilege of rank , I guess . Why ? They got a beauty pageant there tonight ... Miss I-94 . I hear the bar 's pretty wild . Well , I 'm out of here . Thanks , Roger . Your people did a great job . Our usual service . All right . Well , I 'll see you tomorrow . Yeah . Los Angeles passenger Mr. George Kellerman , please pick up the white courtesy telephone . Mr. George Kellerman to the white courtesy telephone . I keep running into you . If you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . Thought I 'd be sick . You get used to it after a while . Excuse me . Well , we could be stuck here for hours . Maybe we 'd better get acquainted . I 'm Louise Baltimore , and you 're Bill Smith . How long is it since you slept ? Do I look that bad ? I didn 't say bad . Just tired . It 's got to be 30 , 35 hours , but who needs sleep ? Listen , maybe we could go have coff ... Some dinner and a few drinks . That 'd be nifty . Am I moving too fast for you ? I can move fast , too . Let 's go . You should be careful , picking up strange women . You never know where it might lead . Oh . Taxi ! We could take my car . What kind of car do you drive ? What kind ? That 's mine . You smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . Just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before . It took me over a year to quit . You don 't believe me ? This is my last cigarette . Was it that good ? You were the best thing in a thousand years , Bill . I was , wasn 't I ? I was stunned . Why ? It 's been so long since I 've ... enjoyed myself ... let alone been swept away . Do you believe in fate ? I will if you will . I think it was fate that brought us together . You may be right . I want to spend more time with you . I 'd like that . We 'll have all day tomorrow . We 'll have all tomorrow night , anyway . This job is killing you , Bill . You need to take a rest . Take it with me . The first rule is , never go to bed with anybody crazier than yourself . I don 't know if you 're crazier , but you 're right there in the top 10 on my weird list . If you knew me better ... I 'd be number one . yes , I 'd like to cancel the 6 : 30 wake-up . Yes . Damn it . They were supposed to call me . Well , they can 't start till you get there . Bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? Sure I remember . Maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . Are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . This job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . Why not ? The world won 't come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years . I got one coming . In one week , I 'll have this investigation started . I can hand it over to someone else . Then I 'll take a long look at my life . Maybe we can go away somewhere together . Anyway , we 've got tonight . I may not be here tonight . We 'll talk about it tonight . Louise ? Louise ? As to systems surrounding engine number four , which was the on sheared off in the collision , let 's consider the fuel feed first . You 'll find that on page 19 of the computer print-out . Everybody got that ? On line 5 , you will see there was a momentary surge when fuel line number four was severed along with 25 feet of wing tip . I 'll have a better figure on that tomorrow ... Smith . Julie , thanks for calling back . No , it has nothing to do with the investigation . I can 't understand it . She was wearing a T.U. outfit . That 's right , Baltimore , like the city . First name , Louise . I guess I made a mistake , then . Thanks , Julie . ... a very little control . Night , fellas . Good night . We 're locking up , Mr. Smith . What 's that ? Will be a guard on that door , over there . Just knock on the glass when you want to go . I 'll do that . Good night . Hell of a mess , huh ? One hell of a mess . Good night . It 's Smith , isn 't it ? I 'm not sure . Looks like the pictures I saw . Is he dead ? Stunned . God damn it . Where 's the stunner ? There . He must have been fooling with it . Is he out ? He 's probably seeing and hearing everything . If yes , it 's already too late . God , what else can go wrong ? Let 's get the hell out . Smith , you 're going to be all right . You don 't know me and I can 't tell you who I am , but you 're endangering a project , that is bigger than you can imagine . Forget about this . This gonna be a paradox , if you don 't . You ... Coventry , send the gate . My god , you think ... we didn 't make those planes crash , I swear it . Stand by for time travelers arriving through gate . Gantry B operators , prepare for arrival . We have major problems . What happened ? We got the stunner . Imagine my relief . Louise , I want an explanation . Our master 's voice . There was a little problem . Those words will be engraved in the annals of understatement . Your mother was a cash register . And she turned a tidy profit , too . Louise ... what happened ? All gate operators , report to decontamination center on shutdown . Do you see that ? Do you see the red blob on the time line ? That is 1989 . That 's where you just went , and there 's the mess you left behind you . It 's a god damn paradox , Louise . It 's a potential paradox . You sent me to get the stunner we lost . Well , here it is . You didn 't mention Smith was there . He already found it and stunned himself . And I think he wasn 't out when we found him . I think he saw us . Sir , I have a time quake approaching . Paradox . Time quake approaching . Force three . A paradox , Louise . You 've changed the past . You know damn well we can 't change the past . It catches up with us . We change . We haven 't changed much . We 're all still dying . This place still stinks . And you are still as ugly as ever . One not much bigger than that could destroy us completely . Look , you 're the one supposed to scan the past . Why don 't you know Smith was gonna be in that hangar ? And you 're supposed to be ready for the unexpected . You 're supposed to be the best . You and your people get the best food , the best quarters . All the precious medicines . Do you realize what it costs to pamper you ? He was there . He was in the dark ! What did you want me to do ? Kill him ? Oh , you 'd like that . Killing him would create the worst paradox imaginable . His life affects thousands of lives in an endless chain . If you break it ... You get 1,000 years of bad luck , and none of us is here anymore . All right . Let 's go find out what happened . Maybe we can still do something . All I 'm getting is temporal censorship from her journal . Scan past it . What 's temporal censorship mean ? It means we can 't see where we 've been or where we 're going to . We can only go back to a specific moment once , and never to that same moment again . Too bad . If we could ... you 'll get used to it after more missions . There he is , in the shadow . Give us rapid scan until he moves . Louise ! That 's my name . You probably dropped the calling card . Louise ! I didn 't mention my name . Neither did anyone else . How does he know my name ? He 's got the initiator . Smith have met me before , haven 't him ? How else would he know your name ? I 've never been back to that era . Should I spell it out for you ? Give it a try , would you ? In Smith 's time , he has met you before . In your time , you 've met him only once , in the hangar , which means you will go back and meet him earlier . I spoke to him , Sherman . That was not a good idea . I didn 't like talking to him , Sherman . I didn 't like it at all . You were not helping him . What 's that supposed to mean ? This seems to be my day for spelling out the obvious . I suppose I should not complain . Come on , you old fraud , prep me for the 1963 flight . The ' 63 mission will proceed to stage one . The ' 63 mission will proceed to stage one . You did not smoke enough , Louise . Give it to me straight , doc . No new degeneration . The levels of complex hydrocarbons in your blood are depressed due to breathing the primordial atmosphere of the 20th century . They think their air 's awful . They ain 't seen nothin ' yet . Maybe I should replace those kidneys . Maybe a little kick , get the old blood moving . Speed kills , my dear . Uniforms and hair for look-alikes will proceed to stage two . Uniforms and hair for look-alikes will proceed to stage two . Sometimes I think you want me to live forever . OK , so , explain it to me . That 's what you 're built for . You know is like meaning what 's going on , own my head . Do you ? Hardly . All right . On a normal mission , when you are taking people who are about to die off doomed airplanes , you do not mind treating them roughly . All done . It 's because I 'm helping them . Obviously without you , those people would be dead , so you can function without remorse . But with Smith , it was different . I don 't think I want to hear any more . How 's the little feather head today ? Louise loves you , Orville . Yes , she does . Polly want a chemical-free sterilized cracker ? I should take you to 1963 . You could fly . Would you like that ? Huh ? Would you like that ? You left Smith helpless and confused , so there was pain in you . All right , I felt sorry for the bastard , but I 'd have shot him if it would straighten things out . As Coventry said , you did not have that choice . What choices do I have ? You say I have to go back because he met me before . Yes . What if I don 't go back ? What happens to the universe ? You must go back . Where 's my free will ? Did you lose it ? I will look around for it . This is awful . You think that 's bad ? Take a look at this . We located the 1963 crash while you were away . It 's likely you will go tomorrow . How are you on the idiom and history ? I know it like the back of my hand . Who was the U.S. president ? Johnson . No , wait , uh ... he was assassinated by ... Vito Corleone ? Louise . We 've talked about quarks and anti neutrinos , but what about people ? It 's quite a step from demonstrating that subatomic particles can travel backward through time to saying that people can . What would be the result of people traveling in time ? For one thing , paradoxes become possible . Say you build a time machine , go back , and murder your father when he was 10 years old . That means you were never born . And if you weren 't , how did you build a time machine ? It 's the possibility of paradoxes that make most people rule out time travel by human beings . Still , why not ? If you were careful , you could do it . You would not go back to kill Adolf Hitler , much as you might like to , because it would change history . A time traveler would have to be careful , but he could do a surprising number of things . He could observe , for one . He could find out once for all who was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas . And he will know what we can only guess at ... that we are destroying the planet we live on by complacency . He will have to live with our legacy of pollution and acid rain . Our negligence today is producing a world in which our children 's children will be barren and the human race heading towards extinction . He could also take things , providing they wouldn 't be missed ... a cup of water from the pacific ocean , a stone from the Grand Canyon . This may sound pointless , but sometimes very small differences can be crucial . The difference between a dead man and a man who 's alive can be very small . What about a man who is about to die , a man no one will ever see alive again ? Stage three alert . All sections , go . This is the hard part about looking for time travelers . They don 't want to be found . You must look for them in places where no one is , or where there are people no one will ever see alive again . All personnel , stand by for departure . Go ! Go ! Aah ! Gate attendants , pick up new arrival . Pick up new arrival . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . This is your captain speaking . We are cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour . If you look out the right side through the clouds , you can see the finger lakes . Our expected time of arrival is on schedule at 4 : 30 . So sit back and relax and enjoy the flight . Alright , send the others . Everything 's nice and quiet . Lets keep it that way . Gantry operators , prepare for arrival . Extreme radiation danger . May I get you a pillow , Sr ? Sure . Prepare holding pens for arriving passengers . I 'm through up here . What 's up ? There 's a guy acting funny . He 's watching us too close . Get up ! Aah ! Oh , my God ! You gonna take me to see the captain . Sir , you can 't shoot that . If you depressurize the cabin , you 'll kill us all . Nobody gets hurt if I see the captain . You stinking son of a bitch . Hey , wake up ! Get in there and cork the crew . You know the flight plan . Keep it steady . Riot squad Martin , fast and dirty . This one 's falling apart . Did ... did that man shoot her ? Don 't worry , honey . It 'll be all right . When she fell ... I want you to sleep now . Attention . Attention . Initiation phase has commenced . All recovery team personnel , stand by . '63 flight in force field . Holding . All systems to gate . Ladies and gentlemen , please remain in your seats . Ladies and gentlemen , please move toward the rear exit door . Please step onto the ramp . Walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety ... Let 's get you out of here . Idiot ! That 's the survivor . Buckle him and came in to help me with Susan . Please step onto the ramp . Walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety area . Please step onto the ramp . Walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety area . Please step onto the ramp . All substitute bodies will be placed strictly according to the passenger list . Passengers now in transit . Prepare to activate holding pen force fields . So , now we know a hijacker caused this crash . We know there was a survivor . We know when it crashed . We just have to duplicate it . I stopped it . I stopped the bullet . You saved us all , kid . Hang in there . You 'll be all right . He must fired his gun in the cockpit . Have Djakarta attach a 5-k bomb to the windscreen . That should duplicate the effect . I lost it . What , Susan ? What did you lose ? Stun . Stunner . I lost the stunner . Look out . Stop it ! Hold the gate ! Stop her ! Baltimore , get out of there ! No time , Louise ! No time ! Louise , there 's a bomb ! One of my team was shot . In the confusion , a stunner was lost . It was too late to get it . You know that preventing a paradox is more important than individual lives . Blame is secondary at this point . The first stunner you lost in 1989 ended up in the possession of Bill Smith . He knows what it can do . Then you went back to 1963 and lost another stunner . The computers estimate it wound up in the possession of Arnold Mayer . If he learns what it can do , he might be capable of learn how it works . The council has decided to risk another mission to 1989 . You must meet Smith the day before you saw him in the hangar . You must prevent him from going to that hangar the night he saw you there . Since he knew your name when he saw you , he must met you previously . Therefore , you did go back . Must go back . I can 't get away from you . I would be a poor personal robot if you could . I lost a very good girl on that plane , Sherman . What was the council 's epitaph for her ? Preventing a paradox is more important than individual lives . Susan knew that . She accepted it . I just ... I couldn 't leave her . It is not necessary to destroy your soul in this job , Louise , but a certain amount of violence will be done to it . You made the wrong choice . It is easy for them to make cold choices , Louise . They are hardly human anymore . Am I so different ? We 're all dying . They 're just a little further along . You are different . You have feelings . They want me to go back again . You have to go back . He must be kept out of that hangar . This isn 't a job for me , Sherman . You want someone bashed in the head , I 'm your girl . You will have to learn new methods . You can do it . I know you can . Then let 's go do it . Standard metal fatigue . Somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . Well , that DC-10 was pretty public . It spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate . They don 't want people gawking at their , uh ... What did they call that crash in Florida ? Involuntary conversion . I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off . Well , they sure are busting their asses on this one . Take this coffee over there , would you ? They even got the ticket agents serving coffee . Put that down ! Just Put that down ! What we gonna do with this stuff ? Did I tell you you could touch that ? Excuse me . Hey . How about some coffee ? What a long night ahead of us . Hey , wait a minute . Declaring an emergency ! We hit another aircraft ! Looked like a 10 . Three and four shutting down . Cutting fuel of the three We are going down ! Repeat ! Going down ! How much of the wing is gone ? Ron , get back there and see what 's left ! Right ! Some coffee , Mr. Smith ? Damn it ! I 'm listening ... still going down . Is there anyplace to land ? Alright Sherman , he 's seen me again . I think he 's interested . What next ? What now , Sherman ? Think of something . Take him to dinner . Someplace romantic . How do I do that ? Pick him up , my dear . How ? Drop your hankie . Wiggle your behind . You 're the woman , Louise . You figure it out . Just be subtle . Louise is about as subtle as a lead pipe . Thanks . It should be appropriate to the era as well as stimulating to the contemporary male . Sorry about the high heels . I keep running into you . If you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . I thought I was going to be sick . You get used to it , after all . Oh ! Excuse me . Well , we could be stuck here for hours . Maybe we 'd better get acquainted . Oh ! Taxi ! We could take my car . What kind of car do you drive ? What kind ? That 's mine . Why don 't you get in ? You got the keys ? Keys ? Whoa ! The tower clear you for that takeoff ? So , do you know Minneapolis ? No . I 've only been here ... Watch it ! A couple of times . I know a good place . Anyplace is fine . Something wrong ? Just watch ... Jesus ! You really drive this thing . Are we almost there ? Another two minutes at this velocity . How long you had this car ? Oh , ah ... Forever . You must be the luckiest woman in the world . hey ! What are you doing ? Idiot ! You all right ? I feel like I should kiss the ground . Wow ! Can 't get that anymore . I 'll have another one . Forget the water . Can 't get it anymore ? It 's old , but it 's not that old . Oh , I mean , I can 't usually afford ... are you ready to order now ? Bill , would you order for me ? I can never decide . Ok . The sole and a tossed salad and Italian dressing . That 's the first time I 've ordered for a girl since after the senior prom in high school . Did I act improperly ? No . It 's just ... Haven 't youever heard of women 's lib ? Suffragette movement , 19th amendment , Rosie the Riveter , bra burning , Gloria Steinem , and the R.A. , battle of the sexes . Who won ? I think it 's still being fought . We might call a truce for tonight . I 'd like that . Who won ? You have a strange sense of humor . Sometimes it 's like you grew up in a foreign country . I did . I grew up abroad , overseas . Whereabouts ? France . I 'm from France . My father was posted there . He was a warrior . Soldier ? That 's right . A soldier . Well , to France , then . Excuse me . Your table 's ready for you now . That 's a real habit you got . What habit is that ? I 've never seen anyone eat and smoke at the same time . Where did it go ? If you hear someone scream , that 's probably where it is . Louise , you got to quit . That tobacco 's ruining your brain . So you never remarried , and you don 't have a girlfriend ? Isn 't that a little unusual ? Is it ? I guess so . I don 't know . Sometimes I wish I ... what ? Done things differently , I guess . The job always came first . I know what you mean . That 's how I feel about my job . Really ? Yours doesn 't take you away in the middle of the night and keep you gone a couple of months . The time I got back , my girl had usually gone . Maybe you didn 't find the right girl . Maybe . Tom says I 'm burning out . Whatever , I just gave up looking . Took a lot of cold showers . You find it difficult to talk about yourself . That 's all I 've been doing . Well , you 're right . I can 't ... open up emotionally ? That 's it . I 'm no good at ... expressing yourself ? I couldn 't have said it better myself . What about you ? Why aren 't you married ? I can 't have any children . I 'm sorry . But that 's not the only reason to get married . Would be for me . I 'd like to get out of here . Where are you staying ? I can drive you there . For a minute , I forgot . I haven 't even seen the room yet . I was going to ask you if it 's nice . You can come up and take a look . It is nice . At least they delivered my luggage . " compliments of the management . " That 's real nice . That is nice . Would you like an apple ? What 's so funny ? I don 't know . You just seem to do everything a little different from everyone else . Is that bad ? I don 't think so . Let 's find out . This may not have been such a good idea . Why not ? You don 't find me attractive ? No . It 's not that . It 's just ... wait . Try it again . Please . I really want this to work . I really need this to work . Let me get the light . The hell with the light . There 's a spare toothbrush in there , if that 's what you 're looking for . I thought you were sleeping . I think I was . Come here . You smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . Just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before . Took me over a year to quit . You don 't believe me ? This is my last cigarette . Damn it ! They were supposed to call me . Well , they can 't start till you get there . Bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? Sure I remember . Maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . Are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . This job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . Why not ? The world 's not going to come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years . I got one coming . In one week , I 'll have this investigation started , and I can hand it over to someone else . Then I 'll take a long look at my life . Maybe we can go away somewhere together . Anyway , we got tonight . I may not be here tonight . Stay with me . I can 't . We 'll talk about it tonight . Sherman , send the gate . Louise ? Gate operation terminated . All controls to zero . Hmm . He 'll never miss it . What happened ? Did you stop him ? Sherman , get my uniform . Paradox ! Time quake approaching ! Force seven . I have to talk to the council . We don 't have much time ! Here 's what happened after I left . Going over every single piece of wreckage in this hangar . Identify it . Tag it . You don 't know what something is , bring it to me . What are we looking for ? I 'll know when I see it . We 'll reassemble the 747 from the ground up . Bill , are you sure ? That 's all , go to work ! He 's forgotten all about what really caused the crash . Now he 's looking for the stunner ... and for me . We 're wasting time , Bill . You can 't learn anything from this . Rebuild it ... every inch of it , day and night . I 'll approve the overtime . Bill . The boss is on the phone from Washington . Tell him I 'll call him back . He says get back there or you 'll be fired . Well , that sounds fairly urgent . Want me to go with you ? I don 't thing you better be around me . It might not be good for your career . He 's doing his job badly now . It had to lead to conflict with his superiors . Bill , I 've always backed you because you were a good investigator . I let you run with this even if I couldn 't see the reason , but you 've turned up nothing new . I have to know what do you expect to find ? If I knew , I wouldn 't have to look so hard for . This crash has been ... crazy from the start ... like the watches that ran backwards . You said that wasn 't important . I didn 't think so . Now I do . The cockpit tape ... the engineers screaming that they 're all dead and burned . Was it computer error or not ? Yeah . Soon as we get your report saying that , we can recommend getting new computers . That 's a big appropriation , and congress is ready to spend the money . Something happened ... In the hangar . I found something . I think it knocked me out . They came and took it from me . And now they 're watching me . I can feel it . They can go anywhere ... look anywhere . There was this ... Girl . Now he 'll go see Dr. Mayer . Dr. Mayer doesn 't have the answers , but he has one of these . It 's the stunner Susan lost in 1963 . Smith has the initiator . You put them together , and it spells paradox . Come in , Mr. Smith . Been expecting you . That 's it . It 's all temporal censorship from there . That means I will go back . I can stop the paradox if I leave now . The watches , the cockpit voice recording ... that could be important , but you say she didn 't know you . That 's right . She said I looked like my pictures . Then she hadn 't met you yet . I told you , we spent the night together . It was unforgettable . You 're missing the point . She finds you in the hangar on the night of the 5th . She returns to wherever she 's from . Then , for reasons of her own , she returns to the 4th and meets you for the first time From her point of view . She 's traveling in time . There has to be another answer . It 's time I showed you something . I 've been working on a puzzle for 25 years . You may be the missing piece . That 's it ! Where 'd you get it ? What is it ? It 's a weapon of some kind . All systems green . Quadrants interlock . All systems go . Two minutes . Baltimore , solo , 1989 . Two minutes . All I want to do is find her . I don 't care about anything else . Bill , I think you 'll see her again . How do you know so much about her ? Because of this object . It 's very important . I 've run tests over the years . I still don 't know what it 's made of . We can 't make one in the 20th century . Where 'd you get it ? It was in the wreckage of a 707 that crashed in upstate New York in 1963 . I was on that plane . That can 't be . The only survivor was a boy named ... William Collins . My mother remarried , and I took the name . This is incredible . Then you must ... what do you remember ? I don 't think about it much . You must remember something . I don 't remember the crash at all . Before that ... people were shouting . Somebody got shot . They found a gun with one shot fired . It was a mental patient , a hijacker . There was this lady . It was her . I remember it now . She told me everything would be all right . She knew you 'd survive . What about her ? Why didn 't she die in the crash ? She got off someway , but left this behind . She 'll want it back . After 25 years ? In our time . But in her time , she just lost it yesterday . This is the key , Bill . Is something that shouldn 't be here . We 're living in her past . If she changes her past , creates a paradox , then her world is destroyed . Oh yes ! We 'll seen more of Louise Baltimore . Laser beams , prepare for countdown . Time tones intimate at 6 seconds . 5 , 4 ... I may not make it back . You will be back . All systems green . 30 seconds . Baltimore , solo , 1989 . 30 seconds . This came off mine . You know too much already . I don 't have much time , but I 'll try answer your questions . Doctor Mayer , I 'll have to take that . You take people off planes just before they crash . We replace what we take with dead bodies . I 'm glad you came back . But the relatives identify them . They identify the wrong people . We duplicate them ... fingerprints , dental records . We 're very good at what we do . Then you are from the future . About 1,000 years . It must be incredible . It must be horrible . It 's awful . We 're all dying . We can make the bodies , but we can 't make the souls . We can 't have children anymore . We steal people from the past to send them somewhere else to start over ... to give them a second chance . I have to take that stunner back with me , Dr. Mayer . It could cause a paradox . I 'm going with you . You can 't , Bill . Haven 't you heard anything I 've said ? You said you were dying . So am I. Bill , the whole race is dying , all of humanity . We 're all going to die . What matters is now ... this moment . I can 't take anything with me that 'll be missed . No one 's going to miss me . The stunner , Dr. Mayer . That 's what I came for . I knew I was right . No ! He 's dead . The paradox has happened . I got to get out of here . Take me with you . Sherman , send the gate . Watch that first step . It 's a killer . Time quake . Force infinity . Paradox . Time quake . Force infinity . Mr. Smith , I presume . Come on . Mayer 's work would have changed history . He wasn 't supposed to die for six years . I tried to stop him . I was too late . It 's all over . The paradox is here . If you had left things alone , nothing of this wouldn 't have happened . I did what I had to do . Our world is at an end . All evidence of our existence will be washed away . We must attempt to send those we have saved into a distant future that may lie beyond the gate . Coventry ... reverse the gate . Get out ! Get out ! Everybody get out ! Go , Louise . Get him out of here . Open the holding pens ! Release everyone and send them to the gate . You will awake now . Remain calm . Remain calm . All right ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Proceed to the gate as quickly as possible . Proceed in single file to the main terminal . Remain calm . Do not be afraid . Do not be afraid . No harm will come to you . Follow directions . Walk toward the light and step into the light . Move along . Move along ! Everything 's all right . Please remain calm . Single file . Walk into the light . You 'll be all right . Keep moving . Single file . Walk into the light . Walk toward the light and step into the light . Our work is done . I move we adjourn . Seconded . Just keep moving . Walk through the light . Walk into the light . Time to go , Bill . The gate will be destroyed in two minutes . What happens when the gate 's gone ? Like a nuclear bomb . Step through , Bill . Together . None of us can go . Only you . Then I 'm not going either . Take a chance , Louise . Go with him . You are going to have his child . The gate will be destroyed in one minute . Sherman , come with us . There is no place for me where you are going . Go ! Now ! This is not the end . This is not the beginning of the end . It is the end of the beginning . Subtitles by Caradecuica .

Nothing in here like that . I saw spinning blue lights . I wrote spinning blue lights . Period ! I 'm starving ! I could eat a horse ! Are you sure ? Charlie ? On the " Johnny Carson Show " ? I thought for sure more like " Believe it or Not ! Don 't you just love small towns ? You can 't sneeze without everybody blowing your nose for you . Laurie ? A-ha ? Charlie really see a flying saucer ? Don 't you start ! Any seat 's OK ! The view is all the same ! Ladies , ladies ! This is not a ? ball here , let 's get these puppies moving !

There was a fella in here earlier looking for you . He was about that high , sort of green , had antennas growing out of his head . He said he met you last night . Morning ! Morning !

How come you picked this town for mail drop ? This is where we are ! A little off the-beat-track , huh ? Say , I forgot to ask you . Do you mind giving me your names ? Why ?

Two R 's ? We still haven 't done anything ! I didn 't say you had , son . I may be a hip deputy in a back-washed county but if one thing I know is people .

( Are these files from the night ? ) ( Yeah ! ) ( Thanks ! ) I can 't believe you gave both our names ! Let 's talk about why I told him . Tell me about last night . I told you ! I remember ! Now tell me what you didn 't tell me . ( Yeah , hold on a second ) Federal Security Agency ? Yeah , hello ? I 'm trying to reach a George Fox ? Our regular office hours are 08 : 30 to 5 : 30 Monday through Friday . Thank you . If we only had enough money for bus fare ! We have exactly 6 dollars and 18 cents . Is that right ? What are you looking at ? Bus fare ! It 's called pool , the idea is to knock the balls on those holes on the table with one of those sticks . It 's all on the wrist . The game 's 8-Ball . One player 's got solids , the other got stripes , whoever 's got one kind just knock them all and then the 8-Ball . But you can 't drop the white ball , specially when you 're shooting with the 8-Ball , That 's called scratching and then you lose . But the other way , you win ? You 'll be home free ! Home free . Just watch what they do and do the same . Scratch shot , Buddy . ( Yeah , sure ) Los Angeles Tribune ? Hi ! Is Bill Nelson working today ? This is an old friend of his , Charlie Ewing ? I 'll give you Editorial . Thank you ! Are you sure this will work ? Just use the silver sphere , we can 't lose ! - I don 't need that . - What ? No , it 's hmmm ... . What you 'd call it ? Simple geometry . Right ! Damn ! Pleasure Vern , as always . - Good practice ! - Hmm ! That 's 23 dollars , We 'll forget about the cents . Anybody else wanna get skinned ? Not me ! Well , Howdy ! Well , Howdy ! Well , what 's your game , friend ? My game 's pol . 8-Ball . His game 's 8-Ball . What you got there ? Six bucks . I 'll take a part of that ! Count me in for a taste ! Alright ! Are you sure you don 't wanna up the bet ? Oh no , thank you ! That 'll be enough . Why don 't you break ? Whatever you say , kid ! You go . Buddy ! We 're stripes . Well , you 're stripes ! Your mother teach you that one , Buddy ? Be quiet , Vern ! Should I get them all in one shot ? No ! One at a time . Are we gonna do this today or what ? Thank you . You may have a problem , Buddy ! ( He 's hitting the other one ) ( I thought that was a scratch ! ) Oh no ! ( Man , three cushions ! ) You do have a problem , Buddy . Look it here ! Who is this guy ? ( Now he 's going for the other ball ) ( He got it , he got it ! ) No way ! ( Doesn 't even come close , This is a for sure scratch ) ( It 's gonna scratch ! ) I love it ! ( Buddy got skinned ! ) Home free ! Maybe not , Mister ! You 're a real shark , huh ? Boys ! I do believe you have been hustled . Why don 't you two step on outside and we can talk a bit ? Thank you . I know who you are . You know who we are ? I called a newspaper friend of mine and found some old clippings about you and George Fox . Putting two and two together wasn 't hard . That 's a great cover , the photography business , and the boy here camping with him ... Perfect ! Even though that story about picking up the check was kind of weak . What are you talking about ? I know that George Fox and the FSA are investigating possible alien life . Why didn 't you identify yourselves as one of his agents ? Why didn 't I ... ? Exactly ! I think you 're here to check in those blue lights ! The lights I saw , remember ? Now tell me , who else has seen them ? Airline pilots ? How many reports you been getting ? Is there any danger ? That 's like secret stuff . Oh come on ! You can tell me ! Is it what I think it is ? Look , we 're on the same side here , aren 't we ? Half the town thinks I made it up ! To tell you the truth , they 're kind of ... amused . OK , you 're right ! I lied , you did see the blue lights . I knew it ! Those photos you shot , I 've been telling a couple of people around here about ... No ... No ... I didn 't think so . Secret stuff . Mister Fox ? Two more ! Nine ! - Mister Fox ! Ten ! What you got ? I thought you 'd wanna know , the FCIC picked up an inquiry on your red flag . Why didn 't you say so ? Alright ! How do I get there ? I 've booked us to LA . There 'll be a rental car waiting . You know what they 're saying in there ? They 're saying you might not get your promotion after this . That 's ridiculous . I 'd say it 's exactly the opposite . What do you mean ? I can 't tell you . All I can say is that I have information about those blue lights I saw , is part of a story that 's gonna blow everybody 's mind all over the world . And I 'm part of it ! OK , Charlie . I gotta go back in . See you at six ? I 'll be there . Urgent call for you , the man said he was from Washington DC . Alright . I don 't like running like this . Seems like a decent man . He 's a cop and he knows about Fox . I know . But it 's our fault he 's having trouble with the people in this town , because of us , they think he 's a joke . They 'll forget , really . We 're the ones in danger . Howdy ! You 're going to town ? You got room ? I 'll make room , hop in ! No , wait son ... You and me ride in the back . Mister Ford , you can ride up front . It 's hot , ain 't it ? I complained about the air conditioner in this bucket of volts . A lot of good is done . Looks like you 're already moving on . Yeah , well ... There 's nothing happening here , I mean we investigated the entire area . Probably blue lights and stuff in the next county . Wouldn 't be a bit surprised . You know it 's such a nice day , How about it , Scott ? Why don 't we walk ? I don 't know what trouble you 're in with the government , this man Fox wouldn 't say , but I know what trouble you 're in right here . Nobody likes to be made a fool of , and for my money , you 're the last straw . I 'm sure there will be more . Funny man . If he knew who you are he 'd die . I hope not . Something about him I like . Her made me empty my pockets and put everything into an envelope . What about you ? I still got it ! I guess he thought it was a marble . Good . Then we leave late tonight . Where 's Bill ? Still out at that accident . I 'm starving ! Oh ! I wish I 'd known ! I 'd brought you something . - Everything quiet ? - Yeah . Well , why don 't you take one off ? I 'm gonna be here . I gotta feed them inside anyway . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Listen , if you go to the Red Barn , skip the meat loaf , They got soap out of a socket . Thanks Charlie . You bet . I hope you like hamburgers . Yes ! Thank you ! How much money do I owe you ? Nothing ! Compliments of the County . Just for the hell of it . Are you a spy or what ? I never saw a flyer on you , what are you wanted for ? For being myself . Serves me right for asking ! Think about what you want it to do . Picture it happening in your mind . I am . Concentrate . You can do it . Just relax , and focus . I can 't do it , you do it ! I got to see the sphere ! What are you doing ? Fixing it so that I can see the sphere . It 's like shooting pool , everything has angles . Hold out the sphere . Scott , run ! Go on ! I won 't hurt you . The truth is I couldn 't if I wanted to . Now ... Who are you ? Paul Forrester . Not after what I just saw . Well , you might say that I 'm the blue lights . Oh my God ! You 're it ! You ? You ... You 're an alien ? Excuse me ? You 're the alien . The one that Fox has been after . I 've been laughing at him too . Holy erm ... What do I do ? I don 't know what to do . Well , you could give me back my silver sphere and let me go . I 'm really a very peaceful ... thing . What happens if I shot you ? It would hurt . I 'd bleed . This body would die . And my son would have no-one to protect him . Is he ... ? also ... like you ? His mother is from Wisconsin , very beautiful . We don 't know where she is but we 're trying to find her . Are you going to shoot me ? Not unless I have to . Holy guts . Who 's gonna believe this ? We both know who . ( Here 's the pillow you requested , Ma 'am , can I ... ) What kind of drive ... ? Wiley ? Wiley ? What can of a drive is this ? How much time ? About three hours from the airport . My kingdom for a chopper . What ? Shakespeare . William ? Yes ! Richard III as a matter of fact who actually said ... Read the play . Deputy Ewing Charlie , honey ? Can 't talk now , Laurie , I 'll call you in the morning ! Wait a minute , Charlie ! Charlie , are you alright ? Charlie ? I made up my mind , as soon as it gets light , we 're going for a ride . Is my son alright ? I don 't know . You 're the one I got . You 're the one I 'm hanging on to . Charlie ? What are you doing here ? You think you can shine me on like that on the phone and I don 't worry ? Laurie , you gotta trust me . I 'm on to something so big ... so wild , I 'm driving to Los Angeles with a prisoner , I 'm gonna meet a plane from Washington DC , and deliver my prisoner to the United States government . and when I do this town is going to brag forever that they knew Charlie Ewing ! Charlie ? I 've never seen you like this . You 're scaring me ! You don 't know what scared is . Laurie , you worry about a promotion ? I 'm telling you ! By tomorrow I 'm going to be on every television station , on every newspaper and magazine in the world ! Charlie , what 's the matter with you , huh ? If you knew who I 've locked up back there , you 'd understand . - Alright ! - No ! No ! It 's dangerous . Charlie , who 's back there ? Charlie ? Who is it ? OK . But you can 't say anything , understand ? You swear you won 't say anything ? Nobody knows ! I even sent the night man away ! Charlie , I swear , just quiet down . I got an alien back there . Call the immigration service . Not from there ! From there ! Another planet . Another world . An ET . Get it ? Charlie , oh my God ! Charlie ? I love you . We all love you ... You don 't believe me . - No , I do , I do believe you . - You 're acting like you don 't ! No , I do Charlie . Sit down , Charlie . Charlie , there 's ... there 's a lot of pressure on you , and I see that now , I 'm so sorry because I should have seen it before . Alright . Look ! Look ! Yo ! Rigor Mortis and Spuds ! Flappers naked ! Charlie , I 'm gonna go home now , and I 'm going to make some tea , and I , I 'm gonna call Bill , or whoever it is that was supposed to work tonight , and I 'm gonna tell him to come back by , and when he gets here , you are gonna come to my house , and the we 're just gonna talk . Quiet like . I 'm taking my prisoner to Los Angeles . There 's a man there who knows I 'm telling the truth , Laurie ! Oh , Charlie , You 're around the bend , and I 'm gonna bring you back on the road . Quietly . With no-one else on it . I can 't take the way they treat you now , and I 'm taking the chance of this getting out . Give me the keys . Not like that . The alien way with the Force or something . The Force ?

 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) # To Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been around ... # Lister , have you ever been hit over the head with a welding mallet ? No ? Stop that and push the trolley . Yes , sir , Rimmer ! Right . Corridor 159 . ( LISTER HUMS THE SAME TUNE ) Lister , shut up ! - I 'm only humming ! - Well , don 't . Don 't hum and don 't make stupid sounds with your cheeks . ( CLICKS TUNE WITH HIS THR0AT ) 0ne more sound , anything , and you 're on report , my laddo . What job number 's this ? ( LISTER MIMES HIS ANSWER ) Right ! That 's it ! " Lister , D. , Third Technician . " 0ffence : Obstructing a superior technician " by humming , clicking and being quiet . " When the Captain sees this , you 're dead . - Rimmer , I 'm bored ! - Bored ? ! This is essential routine maintenance . It 's absolutely vital for the well-being of this crew , this mission and this ship . " Dispenser 172 : Chicken soup nozzle clogged . " Pass me a 14B , Lister . Lister , is this a 14B ? Does it look even remotely like a 14B ? This is a 14B , Lister . This is a 14F . Are you blind ? - Who cares ? - I care , Lister ! It 's my career . I get it in the neck if an officer comes along , orders chicken soup , and gets blackcurrant cordial with blancmange , two creams and a sugar . Chicken soup . ( THE MACHINE HUMS ) Yep . That 's working . It 's stupid , all this maintenance business . The only reason they don 't give this job to the service robots is they 've got a better union than us . That is absolute nonsense . Right . What 's next ? " Botanical gardens : Faulty porous circuit . " In corridor 147 : Sticking door . " It 's true , you know , though , Rimmer . You rank below all four of those service robots . Even the one that 's gone absolutely mad . Not for long , matey . Up , up , up ! That 's where I 'm going ! Not till you pass your engineer 's exam . And you won 't . You 'll go in and flunk again . Last time I only failed by the " narrowest " of narrow margins . You what ? You walked in there , wrote , " I am a fish , " 400 times , did a funny little dance , and fainted . - That 's a total lie ! - No , it 's not ! Petersen told me . " No , it 's not ! Petersen told me . " What I did was , I wrote a discourse on porous circuits which was simply too " radical " , too " unconventional " , too " mould-breaking " for the examiners . Yeah . You said you were a fish . - Is that a cigarette you 're smoking ? - No , it 's a chicken . Right ! You 're on report . Two times in as many minutes , Lister ! - Rimmer , Lister . - Yes , sir . Yo , Todhunter , get down ! Indeed . Rimmer , I 'm going through Mclntyre 's artifacts , and I see that you 've filed 247 complaints ... against Lister . - Yes , sir ! - 123 counts of insulting a superior , 39 counts of dereliction of duty , 84 counts of insubordination , - and one count of mutiny . - Yes , sir ! - Mutiny , Lister ? - I stood on his toe . - Maliciously , with intent to wound . - It was an accident ! How is it possible to stand on one small toe by accident ? You didn 't stand on my toe , you stood on my entire foot , obstructing a superior in pursuit of duty . He was going to snap my guitar in half ! So you leapt from the top bunk onto the whole of my right foot . - That 's enough . - Had there been a crisis , I would have had to hop , putting the ship at risk , therefore mutiny . - Finished ? - I 'm not vindictive , so I won 't apply for the death penalty . There are 169 people on this ship . You , Rimmer , are over one man . Why can 't you two get on ? I try , sir . I 'm not an insubordinate man by nature . I try to respect Rimmer , but it 's not easy . He 's such a smeghead . Did you hear that , sir ? Lister , do you have any conception of the penalty for calling a superior technician a smeghead ? 0h , Rimmer . You ARE a smeghead . You heard that ! With respect , sir , your career 's finished , you big lig ! We are gathered today to pay our last respects to George Mclntyre . George was an excellent officer and as good a friend as one could hope for . He 'll be missed more deeply than he could ever know . Now , I commend his ashes to the stars he loved so much . Goodbye , George , we 'll miss you . ( WH00SH ) This is a piece of music he requested . Start the tape , please . # See you later , alligator In a while , crocodile ... # There goes Mclntyre . # ... so longi Goodbyel # Goodbye George . - That was George ! - I thought it was Mary Queen of Scots ! 0ff ! - I was watching that ! - Tough ! You touch that guitar and I 'll remove the E string and garrotte you . Can I do anything ? Is it 0K if I breathe ? Can I breathe ? I have an exam tomorrow and I intend to pass . By cheating . This is not cheating ! It is merely an aid to memory . It helps me marshal the facts at my command . What ? Copying entire textbooks onto your body ? Hand your body in and let them mark that ! Do you think it is easy for someone like me to become an officer ? Who wasn 't Academy educated ? Who didn 't have the right nobby background or the right parents ? Not the right parents ? Whose did you have ? MY parents . The wrong parents . If you can 't pass fair and square , why bother ? You would , Lister , because you 've no ambition , no drive . You 're content to be the lowest rank on the ship . I 'm not the lowest rank . What about the laboratory mice ? Tell the mice to do something and they 've got to jump to it . " Yes , Mr Lister , sir ! Eee , eee , eee . " Lister , you are a nothing . I 'm not . I 've got me plan . What , to be the slobbiest entity in the entire universe ? No . Me Five Year Plan . I 'm going to do two more trips . I 've been saving up all me pay ... - Since when ? - Since always . That 's why I don 't buy soap , deodorant , socks or suchlike . I 'm going to buy myself a little farm on Fiji and I 'm going to get a sheep and a cow and breed horses . - With a sheep and a cow ? - No , with horses and horses . - 0n Fiji ? - Yeah ! The prices are unbelievable . Yes , because of a volcanic eruption , now most of Fiji is three feet below sea level ! It 's only three feet . They can wade . That 's why the animals are gonna have to be quite tall . Nice plan , Lister ! Excellent plan ! Brilliant plan , Lister ! What about the sheep ? Buy them water wings ? Fit them with stilts ? Cross-breed them with dolphins and have leaping mutton ! Baa , spoosh , baa , spoosh . You can get a drainage grant these days . Why bother ? Be the first to produce wet-look knitwear ! This is why I never said anything to you , I knew you 'd be like this . You have got the brain of a cheese sandwich . ( Y0KEL V0ICE ) " Mornin ' , Farmer Lister ! " Just popping to the shops in my submarine . Can I buy you anything ? " The " Welcome Back George Mclntyre " reception is starting . Everybody is invited , especially those who weren 't able to attend his funeral . - Have you seen Rimmer 's arm ? - No , I 'm waiting for the paperback ! Petersen , have you got a coin ? Watch this great new intelligence test . What you gotta do is force the coin onto your forehead . The more times you bang yourself on the head without it falling , the more intelligent you are . - You gonna go for it ? - ( ALL ) He 's going for it ! - Are you ready ? Can you feel it ? - Yeah ! Can you feel it ? Go ! ( ALL ) Go on ! Go for it ! ( ALL ) Brrr ... brrr ... brrr . - Brrr ... brrr ... brrr ... - Sh ! Sh ! Folks , today is a day for both sadness and joy . Sadness for the passing away of George , and joy , because George is back ... albeit as a hologram . You may not have travelled with a hologram before - just treat him as a normal man , because he is in every respect like George . He has George 's personality , knowledge and his experience . He can 't lift or touch anything , so I ask you to cooperate with his requests . Please take care not to walk through him , not even when you 're in a hurry . ( ALL ) Whoa ! Whoa ! Speech ! Speech ! I want to thank everybody for giving me such a marvellous funeral . I 've just seen the vid . And I want to thank the Captain for his beautiful eulogy . Beautiful . But why didn 't he use the one I wrote ? ! This must seem pretty spooky for everyone , but I don 't want you to think of me as someone who 's dead , more as someone who 's no longer a threat to your marriages . Joe knows what I mean . As you know , Holly 's only capable of sustaining one hologram . So , my advice to anyone more vital to the mission than me is : If you die , I 'll kill you . Please be upstanding for the cutting of the cake . Flight Coordinator George Mclntyre . ( ALL ) George ! ( S0ME0NE GARGLES ) 0K . Just one thing before the disco . Holly has sensed a non-human life form aboard . Sir , it 's Rimmer ! We don 't know what it is , Lister . So just be careful , 0K ? I 'm turning you in , Rimmer . ( GR0UP ) 0oooh ! They 're bound to ask the right thigh , which is 10 % . They must ask the left thigh , which is 20 % . They 've got to ask one of the forearms . Which means I 've passed already ! The left shin 's a bonus ! Right . Cutie : Current under tension is ... What 's this ? Current under tension is equal ? Current under tension is expandable ? Current under tension is expensive ? What does this mean ? What does any of this mean ? I 've covered my body in complete and utter and total absolute nonsense gibberish ! Aaaargh ! Just relax , relax , relax , relax ... Er , plus 20 % of the ship 's course minus the Pythagoras theorem multiplied by two over the x axis minus one equals the total velocity of Red Dwarf , so I know about astro-engineering . Morning , Lister , for probably the last time . Got it all down , have you , Rimmer ? Couple of blanks , but I think I 'm there . So you can 't remember anything ? Think what you will , Lister . F-l-S-H , that 's how you spell " Fish " . Then you just keel over . I 'm sure it 'll all come flooding back . Dry up , Lister . ( INTERC0M H0NKS ) Entrants for the engineer 's examination , make their way to the teaching room . Well , Rimmer , honestly , good luck . It 's all right , Lister . I 'm in complete and total control . Lock ! Lock ! ( CAT MIA0WS ) Frankenstein ! Come on , Frankenstein ! 0h , you 're getting really big now , you know ? I hope it 's not twins . You 've already got all me milk ration . When the baby cat comes , we 'll give it water and pretend it 's milk . It 's only a baby cat , it won 't know , eh ? Do you want to see my picture of Fiji , Frankie ? You 'll love it there . Look . 0K . You 've got three hours . No modems , no speaking slide-rules . Turn over and start . Good luck . - Where 's the Captain 's office ? - Where it says , " Captain 's 0ffice " . - Where it 's always been . - So that 's the Captain 's office ! - How are you , then ? - Fine . Do you know why he wants me ? I think you 've been promoted to Admiral ! - 0h , yeah ? - Yeah . - For your devotion to duty . - 0h , yeah . Lister ! You asked to see me , Captain ? - Where 's the cat ? - What ? What cat ? Lister , not only are you so stupid you bring an unquarantined animal and jeopardise everyone on this ship ... but you take a photo of yourself with the cat and have it internally processed . I 'll ask you again , do you have a cat ? - No . - Have you got a cat ? Er , yes , that one . - Where did you get it , Titan ? - Yes . Don 't you realise it could be carrying " anything " ? Don 't you remember what happened on 0regon with the rabbits ? Lister , a loose animal aboard this ship could get anywhere . It could get into the air ducts or into Holly . A little nibble here and a little nibble there , Lister , and suddenly , we 're flying backwards . I want that cat , and I want it N0W . Sir , just suppose I did have a cat . Just suppose . What would you do with Frankenstein ? Send it to the medical centre , have it cut up and tests run on it . Would you put it back together , after ? Lister , the cat would be dead . With respect , sir , what 's in it for the cat ? Give me that cat . It 's not that easy . Me and the cat are going to have a baby cat , and we 're going to buy a farm on Fiji , with a sheep and a cow and three horses . It 's me plan , and no one can get in the way , not even you , and I do respect you . - Sir ! - Lister , do you want to go into stasis and forfeit 18 months ' wages ? - No - Hand over the cat ? - No . - Choose . - Dave , no one wants to do this . - It 's 0K , I can handle it . - Rimmer , are you all right ? - I can 't really remember . I think I did quite well . - Is this going to hurt ? - Haven 't you travelled interstellar ? - No - You don 't feel a thing . The stasis room creates a static field of time . As X-rays can 't pass through lead , time can 't penetrate a stasis field . Though you exist , you no longer exist in time , and for you time does not exist . You 're still a mass , but no longer an event in space-time , a non-event mass with quantum probability of zero . Simple , eh ? - 0K , I 'm ready . - See you in 18 months . - Holly , activate the stasis field . - 0K , Frank . Good morning , Dave . It is safe for you to emerge from stasis . - Haven 't I just gone in ? - Go to the Drive Room for debriefing . Where is everybody , Hol ? - They 're dead , Dave . - Who is ? - Everybody , Dave . - What , Captain Hollister ? - Everybody 's dead , Dave . - What , Todhunter ? - Everybody 's dead , Dave . - What , Selby ? They 're all dead . Everybody 's dead , Dave . - Petersen isn 't , is he ? - Everybody is dead , Dave . - Not Chen ? - Gordon Bennetl Yesl Everybody . - Everybody 's dead , Dave . - Rimmer ? He 's dead , Dave . Everybody 's dead . Everybody is dead , Davel Wait . Are you trying to tell me everybody 's dead ? I wish I 'd never let him out . - How ? - The drive plate was badly repaired . It blew , and the crew was subjected to a lethal dose of cadmium 2 before I could seal the area . 0h , terrible . Why 's it so dirty here , Hol ? What is this stuff ? That is Catering Officer Olaf Petersen . Aaaah ! I 've been eating half the crew ! - Who 's that ? - That 's Captain Hollister . - And that 's Todhunter . - No , Second Technician Rimmer . 0h , yeah ? I didn 't recognise him without his report book . Why was Rimmer in the Drive Room ? He was explaining why he hadn 't sealed the drive plate properly . So wait on . How long was I in stasis ? I couldn 't release you until the radiation reached a safe level . - How long ? - Three million years . Three million years ! I 've still got that library book . What about Krissie ? Krissie Kochanski ? - She 's dead , Dave . - Aw , hey ! It 's no consolation , but if she were still alive , the age difference would be insurmountable . She was part of me plan . I never told her , but she was going to come with me to Fiji . She was to wear a white dress and ride the horses . I was going to take care of everything else . I planned it . She won 't be much use to you on Fiji now ... unless it snows and you need to grit the path . - Holly ! - Sorry . I 'm sorry about that . I 've been on me own for three million years . I say what I think . I 've gone a bit peculiar , to tell the truth . So everyone 's dead ? I 'm on me own ? Just me ? - Technically speaking , yes . - What do you mean , " technically " ? Hello , Lister . Long time no see . - Rimmer , you 're a hologram ! - Yes . That 's because I 'm dead . Dead as a can of Spam . And it 's all thanks to you . - Me ? What did I do ? - If you hadn 't kept that stupid cat , and been sent to stasis , I would have had help with the repairs and I wouldn 't be dead . - What does it feel like ? - Death ? It 's like being on holiday with a group of Germans . No , I mean being a hologram . Do you mind ? Being a hologram is fine , Lister . I still have the same drives , the same feelings , emotions , but I can 't touch anything . Never again will I be able to brush a rose against my cheek , cradle a laughing child , or interfere with a woman sexually . Rimmer , you never did those things anyway ! - I would have one day , murderer . - Hey , I didn 't do anything ! It was Y0U who didn 't fix the drive plates properly . - Is this me here ? - Yeah . Rimmer , look on the bright side . The bright side ? What bright side ? I 'm dead . I 'm composed entirely of light , and I 'm alone with a man who 'd lose a battle of wits with a stuffed iguana ! What 's an iguana ? Look , look , you 're not dead , are ya ? You 're dead ! But not " dead " dead , 'cause you 're still here ! Lister , I 'm not really here ! I 'm not really me ! Don 't you see ? I 'm a computer simulation of me . That 's me , there , a pile of albino mouse droppings . Come on . Lots of people have died . Lots have died and gone on and done really , really well . You 're a hologram . So what ? I suppose you 're right , Lister . I 've got to pull myself together . But you 've got to help me . Be my hands and my touch . I know what you like to touch . No way , Rimmer . Forget it . Are you smoking ? In the Drive Room ? Yeah . I stopped for a while , but I 'm back on them now . You 're on report , squire . I can 't write it down . I 'll remember it . 0hhh ! Rimmer , I know it 's wrong to speak ill of the dead and all - but you 're still a smeghead . - I beg your pardon ? I said , you 're still a smeghead . Do you have any conception of the penalty for calling a deceased superior technician a smeghead ? - Lister , listen to me . Just listen . - Just shut up . Shut up . Aaahhh ! Aow ! Eeee ! Aow , eee , how am I looking ? Looking nice . No , wait a minute . I 'm looking better than nice . I 'm looking dangerous . 0h , it 's my shadow . Hey , even my shadow 's looking nice . I 'm looking nice . My shadow 's looking nice . What a team ! We are unbelievable ! 0K , team , this way . Lister , hold on , listen to me ... Uh , oh ! Better make myself look big ! Hee hee ! Fearsome . I was fearsome ! # just me and my shadow , ooohhh ! # Come on , boy ! # Walking down the ... # Aaahhh ! Holly , what was that ? During the radioactive crisis , your cat and her kittens were safely sealed in the hold , breeding for three million years , - and evolved into what you just saw . - I don 't get it . - You know man evolved from apes ? - Yeah , I know that . He evolved from cats . His ancestors were cats . He descended from cats . He is a cat . Aaahhh , ooohhh , yeah ... Hello ... Cat ? Whoa ! Crease ! Stand back , Lister . ( SH0UTS INC0HERENTLY ) - Here you go , Cat . - Ah , crispies ! - Holly says you like these . - Mmmm ! Hey ! You monkeys eat off the floor ? Ain 't you got no style or sophistication ? I 'm sorry , Cat . I 'm sorry . You people are unbelievable . - Where are your catty friends ? - Good crispies , man ! Where are your kitties ? Are they gone ? Are they dead ? Have they left ? Who cares ? I want it off the ship ! No ! He 's coming home with us , aren 't you , Cat ? Home ? And where is that ? - Earth . - Who says there 'll be an Earth ? Look what it 's done to a pet in three million years . What has humankind evolved into ? To them , you 'll be like the slime that first crawled out the oceans . - I could smarten meself up . - Nah , you 're a dinosaur . - You 're extinct , nothing . - Hey ! I 've still got me plan . And I 've still got a cat . Not Frankenstein , but still a cat . - Did you say Frankenstein ? - Yeah . She was your great , great , great , great , great , grandmother . The Holy Mother ? The Virgin Birth ? No one believes that stuff . The Virgin Birth ? ! No , it was a big black tom on Titan . Frankenstein , yeah ! I remember that stuff from kitty school . The Holy Mother , saved by Cloister the Stupid , who was frozen in time , and gaveth his life that we might live . No ! No , it 's not Cloister , it 's me , it 's Lister ! It 's Lister the ... stupid ? ! Who shall returneth to lead us to Fuchal , the Promised Land . No , it 's not Fuchal , it 's Fiji ! I will ! I 'll lead you there . That 's where we 're going . Holly , plot a course for Fiji . Look out , Earth . The slime 's coming home ! # It 's cold outside , There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nipping at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

Hurry now , while stocks last , to your nearest Central Services showroom . Designer colors to suit your demanding taste . ... the Ministry of information , Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann . Good evening , David . What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ? Bad sportsmanship . A ruthless minority seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues . They can 't stand seeing the other fellow win . If they played the game , they 'd enjoy life more . There are those who maintain that the Ministry of information has become too large . In a free society , information 's the name of the game . But the cost , Deputy Minister . 7 % of the G.N.P. I understand the taxpayers ' concern . People want value for money . That 's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges . It 's absolutely fair that those found guilty pay for their detention and the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation . is the government winning the battle against terrorists ? Ah , yes . We 're fielding all their strokes , running all of them out . We 're consistently knocking them for six . I 'd say they 're nearly out of the game . The bombing campaign is in its 13th year . Beginner 's luck . Thank you , Deputy Minister . Thank you , David . And a very merry Christmas to you all . " " Scrooge was better than his word . He did it all , and more . And to Tiny Tim , who did not die , he became a second father . He became as good a friend in the good old world . And so , as Tiny Tim observed , God bless us , everyone .

What are you doing ? Harry Tuttle , heating engineer , at your service . Tuttle ? Are you from Central Services ? I called Central Services . They 're a little overworked these days . I intercepted your call . You did what ? Just a minute ... What was that business with the gun ? Just a precaution , sir . Just a precaution . I 've had traps set for me before now . Central Services would love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle . Are you telling me this is illegal ? Officially , only Central Services can touch this stuff . Hold this , please . But nowadays they can 't get decent staff . So they turn a blind eye , as long as I 'm careful . If they could prove I worked on their equipment , that would be different . Wouldn 't it be simpler- - Hold this , please . Wouldn 't it be simpler to work with Central Services ? Couldn 't stand the paperwork . It 's getting warm . Couldn 't stand what ? The paperwork . Your whole system could be burning , and I couldn 't do anything without filling out a 27B-6 . Bloody paperwork . One has to expect a certain amount . Why ? I came into this game for the action . Travel light , get in , get out , a man alone ... Now you can 't move without a form . Found it . There 's your problem . Can you fix it ? No , but I can bypass it with one of these . That 's fine by me . [ Bell Rings ] Are you expecting anyone ? No . No ! Wait , wait ! [ Ding Dong ] Shh ! [ Ding Dong ] The flashlight ! Central Services . Central Services . You rang , sir ?

Damn it , Lowry ! Psst ! We 're in terrible trouble ! Shh ! Look at this . It 's a check . It 's the refund for Tuttle . Tuttle ! I mean Buttle . It 's been confusion from the start . He 's been overcharged for information Retrieval procedures , and someone 's trying to blame us . Can I see ? I 've never seen a refund . I 'll bet it 's Jeffries . Yes , he believes people should pay more for their interrogation . We must get rid of it . Send it to somebody else . Send it to Buttle . It 's his check . I 've tried that . Look at this . The census has him down as dormanted . The computer 's got him down as deleted . Hang on . Information Retrieval has him inoperative . Security has him as excised . Adminstration says he 's completed . He 's dead . Dead ? Well , that 's ... awful . We 'll never get rid of the thing now . What will we do , Sam ? Could try next of kin . Next of kin ... There we go . Buttle , Veronica , Mrs. Veronica ? What 's the check number ? 27 1 ... 56789 ... - O7 4328K . Write into memory . Central Banking . Veronica Buttle ... Mrs ... . Deposit .

This couldn 't have happened before this seventh tier reorganization . That 's Simmons 's doing . He and Jeffries sit together at lunch . Bastards ! We could lose it behind a filing cabinet . Look , there is one solution . Drive out to Mrs. Buttle , let her endorse the check , and let her cash it . That 's brilliant , Sam . I 'll do it for you . Authorize the check . What 's the address ? Everything 's in here . What shall I do next ? Pink and blue receipts . Sign there , there , and there . I think I 've broken a bone . My wrist is all limp . What a pathetic creature I am .

It seems that Mr. Buttle was overcharged by lnformation Retrieval . Yes . They don 't usually make mistakes , but I suppose we 're all human . Oh ! What happened to the , um ... Actually , my coming here is rather unorthodox , as payments are normally made through central computer , but as there were certain difficulties , we thought that rather than cause delay , we 'd let you have it now , it being Christmas and all . My husband 's dead , isn 't he ? I assure you , Mrs. Buttle , the ministry is very scrupulous about eradicating any error , but if you have any complaints , I 'd be happy to send you the appropriate forms . What have you done with his body ? Oh ! Gosh . Uh ... I don 't know anything about that . I 'm just delivering the check . So if you wouldn 't mind signing these two receipts , I 'd be only too happy to leave you in peace . He hadn 't done anything . He was good ! What have you done with his body ?

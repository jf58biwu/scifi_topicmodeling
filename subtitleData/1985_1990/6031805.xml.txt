 This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship " Red Dwarf " , The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak , The only survivors were ; Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold , Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are : a life form who evolved from his cat , and Arnold Rimmer - a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew , I am Holly , the ship 's computer , with an IQ of 6,000 - the same IQ as 6,000 PE teachers , # In a crater , on a ast 'roid excavating for a mine , # Lived an old plutonium miner , and his daughter Clementine # Lister . RD 52169 . Yeth ? Can I help you ? You 've got a lisp . Yeth , I know , The lisp malfunction has been reported to the scutters , Thorry for the inconvenienth , Can you give me a bacon sandwich with French mustard and black coffee ? Your vocabulary unit 's not working either . Yes , I know . Thith altho hath been reported to the scutters . Thorry for the inconvenienth . Can you just try a black coffee ? I 'll certainly try . That 's a bucket . Thorry . Morning , Lister . How 's life in hippie heaven , you pregnant baboon-bellied space beatnik ? What 's the plan for today , then ? Slobbing in the morning , followed by slobbing in the afternoon , then a bit of a snooze before the main evening slob ? God , you 're a disgrace to the species . Good morning , Rimmer . Clock stop ! 6.47 . Not a bad little time for the mile . Pity I was only doing the 300 metres . Still , I had that conversation with Lister . Knock ... 4 minutes off for that . And I stopped to have a rest so I wouldn 't looked too shagged out when I went past him . Knock that off and I 've broken the world record ! Well done Rimsey , you 're fitter than you thought ! Holly , give me a clean uniform . 9 : 47 am , Arnold . No , a clean uniform , you idiot . Look , I 'm rather busy at the moment . Now ! And give me a crewcut Holly . I 'm beginning to look like one of those Hell 's Angels . Arnold , we 're going to hit light speed in 24 hours , I have to navigate a ship the size of a city through speeds never experienced in the human sphere of experience , I 'm not a combination of the Speaking Clock , Moss Bros and Teasy-Weasy , Holly , a hologram I may be , but I 'm still the highest ranking technician aboard this ship . When I say do something , you do it ! Understand ? You stupid , jumped-up filofax . I 'm a what ? You heard . Just get on with it . Very short . OK , Arnold , Have you done it , Hol ? Yes . A crewcut , and it 's very short ? Yes , Arnold , As my father always said ; " Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut , " " and you can cope with anything . " He said that just before that rather unfortunate suicide business . Ah , now that one 's me with Jim Bexley Speed . He played for the London Jets Zero Gravity Football Team . He was roof attack . As you can see , he was really , really , really , really , really thrilled to meet me . Who 's that guy ? That 's me grandmother . She brought me up . She was a great old lady . I got expelled from school once , ' cause she nutted the headmaster when I came bottom in French . Wow . That 's nice . It 's just a Jupiter rise . Everyone takes that shot . Who is that ? That 's me Dad . That 's the only picture I 've got . He 's your father ? No wonder you so ugly . No , no , that 's his dog , Hannah . Dawwg ? What 's a dawwg ? It 's just a pet . Ugleeeeee ! You go and get your stuff and let me pack mine . Okay , will you do that for me ? This , uhh ... dog . He better not be around here anyplace . Because if he is , I may have to chase him . Oh , yeah ? Yeah ! Do you know how big they are ? They 're about 18 foot long ... and they 've got teeth as ... as big as your leg ! Yeah ? Yeah . Well , I may have to chase him anyway ! Aaaaaw ! Oh , Lennon ! Look what 's happened to McCartney . So , mechanical engineering ! Hey ! Perfection ! And they said you was a waste of money . What 's he looking at ? Who ? That idiotic cat . Rimmer , what have you done to your hair ? Holly did it . Why ? 'Cuz I ordered him to . It looks ridiculous . It may look ridiculous to you Lister , but I like it like this . It makes me feel like a man . Yeah . And you 'll probably get one , looking like that . There 's nothing wrong with short hair Lister . It gives a man a sense of dignity , a sense of discipline . Rimmer , have you seen it ? I don 't need to see it . I didn 't get this haircut to look good . This is a haircut designed for action , not poncing around in . Maybe a bit severe . A bit too Green Beret . But you are how you look , and I look ... like a complete and total tit ! Holly ! Holly ! This is a recording , I 'm afraid Holly is busy at the moment , If you 'd like to leave a message after the bleep , he 'll get back to you , Bleep . Holly , this is Rimmer . Remember me ? Rimmer . Arnold Rimmer . The poor goit you made look like Helen Shapiro . I 'll see you toast on the fires of Hell for this . Did someone say they wanted toast ? Shut up . What are you doing ? I 'm going into stasis . I thought Holly told ya ? Stasis ? What for ? Well , Holly said to go into it while we went through light speed . And then I thought " What the hell , why not stay in till we get back to Earth ? " Earth ? That 's three million years away ! You can 't leave me alone for three million years , I 'll go peculiar . Holly , look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to be rude . Can I please have my own hair back ? Pretty please , with sugar on ? I 'll think about it , Arnold . Holly 's supposed to have told you . I thought you didn 't mind . Mind ? Mind ? Why should I mind ? 300,000 millennia alone , while you 're in suspended animation ? I 'll be fine ! I 'll do that crossword book - that should kill a couple of centuries . Holly 'll switch you off until we come back out . Even better . Switch me on , switch me off , like I 'm some battery-powered sex aid . Aww , come on Rimmer . Don 't give me this ! Don 't give you what ? I 'm dead Lister , or haven 't you noticed ? I know you 're dead Rimmer , don 't whinge on about it . Sorry to be a bore . I mean , you 're everything you were when you were alive . Same personality , same everything . Apart from the minuscule detail that I 'm a stiffy . But Rimmer , death isn 't the handicap it used to be in the olden days . It doesn 't screw your career up like it used to . That 's what they say Lister , but if you had two people coming for a job , and one of them was dead , which would you pick ? It depends which was best qualified . Bullpats . When was the last time you saw a dead newsreader ? Channel 27 had a hologram reading the news . Oh ... groovy , funky Channel 27 . Big smegging deal . You livies hate us deadies . Rimmer , if I 'm going to go back to Earth , I 'm gonna have to go into stasis . It 's gonna take 4,000 years just to turn around . You can 't do a three-point turn when you 're this close to light speed you know . Oh , really ? Where did you read that , the Ladybird Book of Astronavigation ? It happens to be true . I know it 's true modo . I have taken the astronavigation exam nine times . Ten , if you count the time I had my spasm . Rimmer , you 'll only be turned off till we get back to Earth . Where you won 't need me , so I won 't get switched back on . They might be able to cure you . They probably made great advances in that while we 've been away . Oh yes , I expect they cured death the instant we left Earth . I expect doctors ' surgeries are packed with the dead . " Hello Mrs. Johnstone , take one of these three times a day , " you 'll soon be living again , " Carole , next corpse , please . " Well , they might . Yes Lister , they might , if the Earth hasn 't blown up . Or the ants haven 't taken over . Well , you 'll be in your element if insects are in control . You 'll probably get a decent job at last . Yeah , yeah . You 'd probably run for government . Yeah , yeah . You 'll probably even make it as a male model . Git . # To Ganymede and Titan # Yes , sir , I 've been around . # But there ain 't no place in the whole of s ... # space . # Like that good ol ' toddlin ' town ... # Oh , oohh ... # Lunar Sss ... # # Lunar City Seven ... # You can 't sing , you know . And you can , can you ? Oh , just ' cuz I 'm a toaster I 'm tone deaf ? Well go on , then ! Welcome to the Starlight Ballroom ... Hey ! # Fly me to the moon and let me ... # # Lunar City 7 ... # What was that ? ! Umm , uhh , 11 : 14 ship time , Dave . No , Holly , what was that flash ? We 've broken the light barrier 22 hours early . Is everyone all right ? I can 't do it , I can 't cope , we 're going at the speed of light , me bottle 's gone , Holly , is everyone all right ? No , I 'm not , I thought I could navigate at light speed , but I just can 't wrap me head around it . Gordon Bennet , that was a close one ! Holly , what 's the problem ? You 're supposed to have an IQ of 6,000 aren 't ya ! Look , we 're traveling faster than the speed of light , that means by the time we see something , we 've already passed through it . Even with an IQ of 6,000 , it 's still brown trousers time . Can I help ? No , it 's all right , I 'm getting the hang of it now , Left a bit ... straighten her up I better go . # To Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been around ... # Rimmer ! Rimmer ! # To Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been a ... # Rimmer ! What ? What is it ? Did you see anything really weird in that mirror ? Yes . You , you ugly goit . No . It was ... It was really odd . What was ? Oh , nothing . Forget it . Doesn 't matter . What doesn 't matter ? Nothing , forget it . It doesn 't matter . Lister , have you been at that marijuana gin again ? I said forget it . It doesn 't matter . Fine . Well , if you have more problems with ' nothing and things that don 't matter , just scream out my name hysterically , and I 'll come pelting down the corridor ! All right ? # This little kitty went to space ... # This little kitty stayed at home # Ooohh , aaaahh , tcheee ... # My clothes are ... # What are you doing ? I 'm doing what you said , dude . Well , I said take a few essentials basics you couldn 't bear to leave behind . Right . These are all I 'm taking . Just these and the other ten racks . Travel light , and move fast . You can 't take all of this . There 's no room . OK . I 'll leave ... This ! I 'll just have to do without it . You can take two suits , that 's it . Two suits ! ? Then I 'm staying . You can 't stay , by the time I come out you 'll be dead . Two suits IS dead . Hey , if I cut off my leg and leave it behind , can I take three ? I 'm going into stasis in 10 minutes , I 'll meet you in the sleeping quarters . Yo Rimmer , look I 've been thinking . What ? You know , about going into stasis and everything . How did I do what ? What do you mean , " How did I do what ? " Lister , don 't be a gimboid . I 'm not being a gimboid ! I 've just been in the library , thinking , and I 've decided ... Shut up ! As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted , I 've decided when you go into stasis I want to say behind . I want to be left on . What , on your own , for the rest of your life ? What things ? Eh ? I said , what ? What 's going on ? You are space crazy . I 'M space crazy ? ! You 're the one who 's ... space crazy ? ! Well it probably is déja-vu . It sounds like it . Aaaagh ! Rimmer , I 've just seen you walk out of that door . What ? How did you do that ? How did I do what ? You just a second walked out of that door . Lister , don 't be a gimboid . I swear on me Grandmother 's life , as you walked out that door you came in this one ! I 've just been in the library thinking , - and I 've decided ... - Rimmer , I 'm telling you ... Shut up ! As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted , I 've decided when you go into stasis I want to stay behind . I want to be left on . Rimmer , you 've just came in and said exactly these things . What things ? You said that . I said what ? And that . You said that . You are space crazy . And then you said ... " Well , it probably is déja-vu . " Well , it probably is déja-vu . It sounds like it . Oh go on , then : shake your head and walk out . Rimmer , listen . Will you just listen ? My tooth ! My tooth ! I think I lost my tooth ! Cat , wait . Rimmer , listen . I 'm gonna eat you little fishies . I 'm gonna eat you ... I was just making sure your fish were OK . I wasn 't going to eat them . He just walked past us . It must be something to do with light speed . Holly , what 's going on ? It 's light speed , I bet ya . Is your name Holly ? " Is your name Holly " Holly ! What is going on ? Look , I 'm a 10th generation Al hologramic computer , I 'm not your mum . Yes , fantastic . What do you want this time , a hand with your homework ? Would you like me to sew little name-tags in your PE kit ? Holly , watch my lips . What is hap - pen - ing ? With the mirror , and the cat , and everything ... Oh , that . You 're seeing future echoes . Didn 't I explain this to you ? What are future echoes ? How simple do you want this ? Uhh , so Lister can understand it . Oh , dear , It 's difficult , I know . Well , we 're traveling faster than L.S. right ? What 's L.S. ? Light Speed Smartass Consequently you 're catching up with things you 're about to do before you 've actually done them , Ahh , so we 're seeing bits of the future ? Yes . See I told you it was light speed . You should 've asked me . Can they see us ? Of course not . Use your loaf . So , wait . Are you saying that the Cat is gonna break his tooth some time in the future ? Yes . I didn 't think you wanted it THIS simple , Ain 't nobody gonna break my tooth . How long is this gonna last ? Until the reverse thrust takes effect and we drop below light speed . What 's that photograph ? It 's me and Frankenstein , isn 't it ? No . The one with the babies . Babies ? I 've never seen it before . Ahh , Holly , is this what you call a future echo ? Yes , of course it is . Bozo . Two babies . How do I get two babies ? # Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been around # But there ain 't no place in the whole of space # What 's this , guys ? " Don 't go into stasis . Please don 't leave us with Rimmer . " I 'm sorry , guys , I 've got to . We need you . I mean , there 's nothing for me here . I want to go back to Earth . Ah don 't do that ! I mean , I don 't care what it 's like . It gotta be better than this . I don 't care if the dolphins have taken over , and all the people in a human being-atarium , you know ? I just want to find out . What was that ? ! What was that ? Brace yourself for a bit of a shock Lister , but I just saw you die ! What ? I did warn you to brace yourself . You didn 't give me much of a chance . I gave you ample bracing time . No you didn 't ... you didn 't even pause . Well I 'm sorry . I 've just had a rather nasty experience . I have just seen someone I know , die in the most ... hideous , hideous way ! Yeah , me ! You were fiddling around with a navi ... I don 't wanna know . Don 't wanna know . You don 't wanna know how you die ? No ! Was it quick ? Well ... I wouldn 't say it was super-fast . Not if you count the thrashing around , and the uh , agonized squealing . You 're really loving this , aren 't ya ? What a horrible thing to say ! It was definitely me ? Oh , yes . I don 't wanna know . How old did I look ? How old are you now ? 25 . How old did I look ? Mid-twenties . Smeg ! I 'm not ready . I 'm not smegging ready ! You did seem surprised . Ahh , did you actually see me face ? You were wearing a hat , but it was definitely you . Well there you go , I won 't wear a hat , and it can 't happen . Can it ? I can live without a hat . Lister , it has happened . You can 't change it any more than you can change what you had for breakfast , yesterday Hey , it hasn 't happened , has it ? It has will have going to have happen , happened but it hasn 't actually ... happened , happened yet , actually . Poppycock . It will be happened , it shall be going to be happening , it will be was an event that could will have been taken place in the future . Simple as that . You bucket 's been kicked , baby . Says you . Says me and Albert Einstein , thank you very much . Albo and I happen to agree on this one - it 's called the Theory of Relativity . All right . OK . OK . Right . The Cat broke his tooth in a future echo , right ? Now , if I can stop him breaking it ... Can 't be done . Then I can stop me from dying . Can 't be done . Now , how would the cat break his tooth ? it 'd be eating something ... eating something hard ! My robot goldfish ! Eating my robot goldfish ! Holly , where 's the Cat ? He 's just going into your sleeping quarters Dave , Oh , Smegging Hell ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm back . Feeling good . How am I looking ? Go-oo-od . You know , I wish I was someone else ... then I could kiss me . I think I 'll investigate ... these ! I just ate . But , one little fishy ... # Yeah , yeah , I 'm gonna eat you , little fishies .. # I 'm gonna eat you , little fishy # Yeah , I got you babe ! I 'm gonna ... I got the fish , I 'm not gonna die ! I 'm not gonna ... Crazy monkey ! You creased my suit . My tooth ! My tooth ! My tooth ! I think I 've lost my tooth . Lister , allow me to be the first to offer my commiserations . You 're really , really loving this , aren 't ya ? Come on ! " Death isn 't the handicap it used to be in the olden days " ! " It doesn 't screw your career up in the way it used to " ! You 're right . There 's always some good in every situation . Absolutely Lister . And in this case you are about to do the largest splits you 'll ever do in your life . I get blown up , then ? Bits of you do . It 's not fair . There 's loads of things I 've never done . Like ... I 've never had a prawn vindaloo . And I 've never read ... a book . And I wanted to have a family . And I wanted to have loads of practice in the things that you 've got to do to get a family . Holly , I 'd like to send an internal memo . Black border . Begins : " To Dave Lister , " condolences on your passing away . " What 's that poem ? " Now , weary traveler , " rest your head , for just like me , you 're utterly dead . " Emergency . Emergency . There 's an emergency going on . What is it , Hol ? There 's an emergency , Dave . The navicomp 's overheating , I need your help in the Drive Room . Come in number 1-6-9 , your time is up . OK . What was I wearing ? That jacket and that red t-shirt . You said yourself I can 't stop it . Let 's get it over with . Lister , what 's that for ? I 'm going out like I came in : screaming and kicking . You can 't whack Death on the head . If he comes near me , I 'm gonna rip his nipples off . I am afraid it can 't cope with the influx of data at light speed , Dave . Could you hook it up to the drive computer for me ? Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... I did it ! I 'm not going to die . Dog attack . I don 't know why you 're so chirpy . I 'm alive . But for how long ? It 'll probably happen tomorrow , or Thursday . - Maybe it 's not going to happen at all . - It was you , I saw you . I 'm sure it was you . Hello , Dave . This is me . I mean you . I mean , I am you . This is you aged 171 , Dave . I know you 're there , because when I was your age , I saw me at my age telling you what I 'm about to tell you , and you 've got to tell you , when you get to be me . Thank heavens you 've still got all your marbles Lister . I 've got to tell you about Bexley . Who 's Bexley ? I was always going to call my second son " Bexley " , after Jim Bexley Speed . Your second son ? What were you going to call your first son ? Jim ! After Jim Bexley Speed . It wasn 't you Rimmer saw in the Drive Room , it was Bexley . Rimmer , you saw me son die ! Never mind this tott ! What about me , old man ? What happens to me ? Do I become an officer ? Rimmer , I 'm gonna have two sons ! Isn 't it fantastic ? But one of them dies . Yeah , but everyone dies . You 're born , you die . The middle bit is called " life " , and that 's still to come ! Go and get your camera . You haven 't got much time . Get your camera and run to the medical unit . Run ! What about me ? What happens to me ? He can 't hear us Rimmer , he 's from the future . Ah , but if I ask you now , you can remember it , and when you get to be him , you can tell me . Boss thinking ! Rimmer , you wanted to know what happened to you . Yes ! Well , come closer . Come closer still . Closer . Yes ! Heh , heh , heh . You goit ! No , you goit . You 're all goits . I 'm surrounded by goits . Holly , you 're a goit . I 'm a what ? You heard ! What 's happening , Hol ? Are we going to see my funeral or something ? Look , the faster we go , the more into the future the future echoes are , And now , since we 've just started to slow down , the future echoes are nearer to the present . Clear ? No . Tough . Wait a minute . I don 't understand how you 're supposed to get two sons , without a woman on the ship . Neither do I. But it 's gonna be a laugh finding out . I can 't see you , but I know you can see me . I 'd like you to meet your two sons . This is Jim and this is Bexley . Oh , stop crying and say " cheese " , boys ! # It 's cold outside . There 's no kind of atmosphere . # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly , far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

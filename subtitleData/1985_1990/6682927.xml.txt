El : Of course he is . He 's floating . not MacGreve . I 'm talking about Buchre . The guy 's got thirty million in treasure he can 't sell . It 's just sittin ' there in front of ' im . Kind of like me and these picnic tickets . Dr. Hayes . Herb just called and bought eighteen tickets . I 'm taking him bowling . don 't you think bribing the ticket buyers is a little out of line ? Miss Nance ? Do I know a Herb ? El : The Invisible Man . Oh . Bowling . Could be interesting . I don 't care where you live . I just think you should know that it 's dangerous down there . What are you talking about ? Where ? In the tunnels . what is it with you and this tunnel fixation ? We just pulled a kid out . I mean – couldn 't we stop talkin ' tunnels and start talkin ' records ? Records ... An antique . Want one ? Could you buy me Sting instead ? Aww . You 're a killer .

Just follow the girl with the pizza box . I don 't wanna crowd ' im . and tell him it 's from Gina ? Oh ! And one more thing . My mother 's checking in soon for an operation . Do you have any rooms on this floor with a shower ? Three-forty-one 's empty if you 'd like to check it out . thank you . mate . How many guards ? Ten . Maybe twelve . Scamper like the rest when the tunnels go . make sure those valves are all the way open . How are they holding the gas ? Well enough to panic five or ten city blocks . Providing some Jacks from maintenance don 't set off another tunnel on their own . We should be okay as long as there are no more surprises like that bloody kid . but don 't bother checkin ' it out with juvie hall or foster homes . I made it up . Zack ? I asked you if you lived down there . okay ? you do need our help if you live down there . The air 's bad . Really bad . Just the last day or so . We can handle it . 'We ' ? Who 's ' we ' ? are there more of you living down there ? you don 't have to be afraid of us . I don 't bite . she does . ladies . now this . Supposed to say it 's from Gina . Gina ! Gina ! do you really think there are other people down there ? - No . - Yes ! whoa . Wait a minute . Let 's pick one . I can tell when a kid 's lying . I can tell when a kid 's kicking . we gotta do something . are you okay ? couldn 't be better . what was that ? Great . I finally isolated the gas that 's in those tunnels . What is it ? Methane . Girls ? How 'd you like to crash a party ? Thank you . miss ? Yes ? Your invitation . Do you mean we were supposed to bring them ? How gauche . Celebrities . We were simply interested in the technology . come here and take a look at this . Let 's take a look at this goblet . This goblet alone is worth over six thousand dollars . Mr. Buchre would know . he 's not here . He jus – he keeps disappearing . if you 're doing all of this just for the hors d 'oeuvres . this could be an emergency . I know – ya know ? it 's not gonna be that snobby . I know what 's going on at these places . bud ? the service entrance is around the back . I don 't think you understand . We 're – Psst ! Come on ! these people need us . good . I 'm so glad you 're here . The leaky toilet 's in the second-floor men 's room . Hayes . Jane . okay ? is that you ? we need some more sandwiches here . Thank you . but isn 't that pushing it a bit ? psst ! What ? Come on . What ? What is it ? You 're not gonna believe this . I couldn 't find Richard anywhere – Thanks . But I did see that wannabe that was flirting with Johnny B. they 're terrific . The ones with the little red balls on top . I don 't like caviar . Don 't you think it 's a little strange that she 's here ? What caviar ? The little balls on top of that are red . it 'll be all right . Salmon caviar 's red . El . They use ' em as bait . Wha – what 're – what 're these little rice cakes with the yellow gooey stuff on top ? What is that ? There you are . I 've been looking all over for you . The bathroom is – It 's a long story Hayes ? Richard . Methane ? I told the bartenders only to serve – Richard . Methane . It 's a gas . A what ? It 's a flammable gas . Do ya remember what happened in the Fairfax district ? boom ! The whole thing went . That was methane ? the concentration under here could be higher than Fairfax was . This is something we should report right away . and now methane . Who the hell are you ? Glo : He wasn 't home . I talked to one of the guys in the band . Yeah ? he went into the tunnels looking for that girl . Looking for Gina . if he even sparks – Don 't tell me ! Bukowski . You know ' im ? what 's he doing here ? What are we going to do with him ? That 's the question . Leave him . but killing ' a fella ... Syl ? Thirty million dollars . Is he worth it ? Let 's just finish what we came here to do . Right . and then get out of here . Gina ! we 've been looking all over for you . look . So I don 't have an invitation . You wanna throw me out ? we 're friends of Johnny B. fast It 's very dangerous for him to be down there . Unh-uh . You are talking to the wrong person . you 've gotta understand what we 're trying to tell ya here . too . but we have a feeling there are more of you . Wha ? Who are you ? Where 's Gina ? The air 's better in here . You 'll be okay . You 're the guy in the band that plays in that garage on Hudson . Gina took me last week to listen to ya . You 're good . Thanks . Wher – do ya know where she is ? I think . they 're all swimming around in a sea of methane down there . With a human sparkler . one spark from Johnny B and we 're talkin ' the Fourth of July here ! Those guys in masks ! spraying for cockroaches or something . Whoa ! What guys in masks ? Does she live here ? you know ? Mama Gina . Yeah . it 's a lot better than livin ' on the street . Or where the County put us . And that kid we pulled out this morning ? Zack ? Is he okay ? We wondered what happened to ' im . he 's fine . we won 't be if we stay here very much longer . just forget about gettin ' out . but we can 't get far enough through the tunnels . so we just figured we 'd ride it out . I don 't think that 's a very good idea . I can feel the gas comin ' in please . Right this way . I – I found him . Here he is . Richard 's filled me in on this methane stuff and I think it 's ridiculous . You 're making a big deal out of nothing . You always have methane under the city . Methane that 's being pumped in ? What ? bleeding tanks into the tunnels . They 're probably just city employees . El : Are you willing to take that chance ? and someone – or something – sparks Boom ! Boom ? - Boom ! - Boom ! Al : Alright . Wait a minute . let 's at least do it right and call the professionals . Would ya feel better if I called the fire department and had them check it out ? That 's a start . Good . Isn 't he terrific ? He 's terrific . methane rises . I 'll be back with some help as soon as I can . man . It 's eight blocks to the nearest grate . Watch me . you 're gonna stay right here until the authorities arrive . Do you understand ? an – and some of the ones with the little squiggly Spam stuff on top . That 's liver . Pâté . there are hundreds of tunnels down there . anyway ? With Gina . where 'd she go ? Goon : They told you to call the fire department ? That 's great ! Are you ready ? we 're ready . Will you be around soon ? Al : I 'm leaving right now . They 'll make the big bang in ... ten minutes ? Right . Gina ! They told me you were down here . I didn 't believe ' em . we gotta get out of here . I got some people I gotta see . I was just there . You 'll never make it. there 's no air . We gotta get help . I don 't need help . What are you so afraid of ? you can 't live your life solo . okay ? they start screwing ' up your life . I 'm not – I 'm not talkin ' about a relationship here . I 'm talkin ' about getting me out of this tunnel so I can get some help for your friends . but it doesn 't for me . Forget it . I don 't need help either . I gotta get them out of there . Help me . Richard . The tunnel entrance in the basement 's filled with gas . We 'll say we got a big firecracker . what can I say ? ! How 'm I gonna break it to everyone ? Everybody get outta here ! There 's gonna be an explosion ! Get out ! Richard . we gotta go back . You are not going anywhere . we gotta do something . We gotta get ' em outta there . Okay . I 'll take ya . Blasting caps . Timers . I found ' em . There hafta be more . Does yours say the same as mine ? Five and a half minutes . if – if you would . I 'm – we 're gonna do this again . everybody hurry right along . you can 't take another trip down there . Look at you . let 's go . Come on Gina B-Man . Come on . I 'm fine . Gimme a mask . come on . Here 's to the end of an otherwise fabulous career . fast . Gina : Here . there 's no time . Gina . is there any kind of large opening out of these tunnels ? serve as a safety valve if it explodes . not very big . there 's a fountain ! About a couple hundred yards from here . it 's always locked up tight . Which way ? You won 't have time . Which way ? Down that tunnel . okay ? We 're gonna check out the fountain . we 're running out of time . I – I gotta find my bag . Go on . Al : The explosion 'll take out the tunnels and bring real fire trucks so you 'll blend right in . We go straight for the treasure ? no looking around . And the alarm system will get knocked out ? Sure . mate . Piece o ' cake . shake it up ! This is it . This has to be the fountain entrance that Gina was talking about . Locked ! They 're always locked ! There 's no hole ? ! I thought we needed a hole ? ! that would just leave the floor of the fountain . And that oughta come off like a piece of paper when the thing explodes . El ? El : I don 't think we 're gonna live long enough to make the calculations Maybe . we gotta get inside . Can you do it ? I think I can fit through here . My clothes are in the lunchbox . Here ya are . Here goes . Hit it . the methane 'll blow right through the fountain . It 's the course of least resistance . what moves these doors ? What ? What moves these doors ? I 'm still lookin ' . we 're getting a little short – El . A couple of big motors – too big for me to start . The best I can do is short the locks . Whoa ! we 're almost there . where 's Gina ? Lookin ' for her bag . You guys go ahead . let 's get outta here . it won 't move . They 're frozen . Glo . don 't give up now . okay ? Let 's give it a try . One more . Come on . they 're going . Billy ! Billy ! Glo . let 's go . I got one last little detail to take care of . get outta here ! Al ? Richard . Foul play . Just what I needed . this belongs to you . it belongs to the government and I 'm gonna be a little too frail to enjoy it by then . This way I get the jewels and the insurance now . Richard You 're going to regret this . you 're gonna regret this more than I do . Not really . I ju – I 've called the police . And they 're gonna jump out of their hiding places and yell " Freeze " ? Hopefully . Freeze ! Johnny : Gina ! we gotta get outta here . Come on . I think this is a good time to stop and – and reconsider the purchase of just a few more of these picnic tickets . they 're only two-fifty apiece . and I think Hawaii would be a great – would be a great release . And I got all Don Ho 's hits – I bought all of his greatest hits . And I love those – the – the drinks with the blue and yellow – I – I – get with it ! I just don 't understand it . Company picnic . Good times . I called everybody I know . everybody I ever heard of . And Miss Nance – Hayes . Even I bought tickets from her . you bought tickets from me . only two . uh ... Where are the girls ? they 're late aren 't they ? They 're with my date . You have a date ? Gina . ( Girls chatting outside ) We are ready . an experimental project for street kids sponsored by Social Services . Alright . but you can broom the idea they 're sitting on us or anything . and a fancy new name . unique way . let 's grab this stuff and go hit some homeruns . Right ! Doctor Hayes ? Miss Nance ... would ya ? sorry . I 'm already taking Barry . And Herb . Barry and Herb ? But there 're only two tickets . Miss Nance ? Herb ! The Invisible Man ! ooh Feels Like Science Straight From The Heart Class Assignment oh no no Science is over Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies .

 ( chattering ) your recentstring offailures makes me question the wisdom ofyour present proposal . - Butsir- - - General , there 's no future in all these costly sea battles . Betterto save some ofthis money ... and spend iton the police force instead . Are you saying we are notcapable ? No , that 's notwhat I 'm saying . You 're capable of sailing your ships to the East Bay . When the pirate ships are here to the west ... You 're capable of- - ( Blows ) losing two ships . Itwas an unexpected hurricane . How do you explain lastwinter ? You were so certain that You took your ships ... and sailed to capture the Sam Pao pirates . You wentaround and around in circles ... tillyou wound up in Malaysia , like some drunk who lost his way . - Explain that . - Uh , navigational error . It 's a comedy of errors- - wasting taxes , chasing after pirates ... while fortwo whole years my police force ... - has been waiting for a pay raise ! - Ah , yes . Now I see what this argument is all about . - ( Huffs ) - You wanta pay raise . - ( Moans ) - And why shouldn 't I geta raise ? At least I knowwhat I 'm doing ! - Sorry , sir . - Oh , you 've proven that here this morning . Admiral , ifyou 're confiident in your new procedure , do it now . ( Shouting ) ( Man ) Dragon , you 're wanted right away. lt 's urgent.i - Dragon , take these papers to captain Tze . - Okay . Good morning . - In training forthe Olympics ? - No , sir . Slow down . Sir . Sign , please . All this ammunition ? ls it necessary ? ls the navy going to war ? No , butthe sea is a very dangerous place . Adangerous place ? How aboutthe streets of Hong Kong ? Have you seen whatwe have to fight ? And we 're practically unarmed . - Corporal.i - Yes , sir . Tell our men to practice running . No more shooting at criminals . - We 'll run afterthem instead . - Yes , sir . It 's amazing , the amountof ammunition ... thatyou go through . Do you suppose you 'd all become bettermarksmen ... and use less ammunition ifthe governmentmade all of you pay for it ? Yes , sir , butthatwould make us better shooters than the Hong Kong police . What ? Stand straight when you talk to me . Now , you listen here , sailor . The Hong Kong police can shootwith the best . You don 'tsee my men begging formore ammunition . It kills me to have to give itto you every time you ask for it . For once , I 'd like to see you shootsomething . When you see your admiral , tell him it 's the lasttime . Sailor ? You 're lucky you 're not in my company . Go ! Yes , sir . - ( Glass Breaks ) - Huh ? ( Groans ) Writing to Mom ? Tell herwe 'll be home in two days . - Don 'tforgetyour life jacket . - Don 'tworry . I 'll sleep with iton . Hey , why so sad ? cheer up . Why are all of you looking so unhappy ? We 're not dead yet . The cops are watching them , aren 'tthey ? We should be laughing our heads off .

Beer . - I 'd like the same . - Bartender , four beers ! - Is there any room forme ? - Sure . Sit down . Please , have a seat . Hey , whose party ? They 're celebrating . Going after pirates . Some ofthem might not be coming back . - How abouta milkshake ? - No milkshake . - The girls want beers . - Justone , though . No wonderwe can 't get a pay raise . All ourmoney goes to these clowns so they can chase pirates . Makes me sick . They get lostevery time they go to sea ! ( Dragon ) Settle down . Don 't listen to him . You knowwhat ?

( Man # 2 ) 'Causing a sea traffiic jam , so to speak ? But don 'tyou see ? That 's ridiculous . We are in the shipping business ... and even ifyou blockade these waters for months ... Lo Sam Pao may still elude you . ln the meantime , we shippers will be put out ofbusiness . There has to be anotherway . ( Man # 1 ) Don 't forget the pirates have the rearadmiral and the others . Freeing them is ourfiirst priority . Well , we can 't letanything happen to the rear admiral . That 's right . We must at all costs save the admiral 's life . It 's abouttime you came up with a good plan . ( cries Out ) - Please have a seat , Mr. chow . - Thank you . Ah , forgive me , gentlemen . Duty calls . - Gentlemen . - Of course . ( Mr. Chow ) Where were we ? Oh , yes . A blockade is out ofthe question . There 's an old English proverb thatsays , " ' Tis betterto compromise than to risk itall . " Now , ifthose pirates wantmoney , we 'll give itto them . I understand you 're willing to actas a go-between ... so it 's justa matter of coming up with the money . The Navy Training Fund will do nicely . you 're an easy man to do business with , Colonel . There 's also the matter ... of some of my men being unfairly arrested . - Let 's work thatout . - I 'll orderthe captain to release them immediately . colonel , I really can 't help admiring yourmedals . Ah , one ofthe true privileges of service . To you . To ensure safe passage for my ships ... I have had some unoffiicial contact with the pirates ... but this time I 'll have to go personally to see Sam Pao . I 'd like to present him with 100 rifles as a gesture of good faith . ( Colonel ) Oh , my . Well , that does have the ring ofimpropriety , Mr. Chow . ( Mr. Chow ) Believe me , Colonel , itwill greatly expedite matters . ( Colonel ) Very well , then . I 'll arrange it . - Good day , sir.This way . - Good day . You , there , what- - Getoutof ... there . What ? ( Mumbling , Indistinct ) Who are you ? Master Sergeant Maillong .

Uh , uh- - You 've known all along that the onlyway to stop these criminals ... is by going to war againstall ofthem ... Yetyou are too much of a coward . The people of Hong Kong can only be pushed so far . Itseems to me the time has come to start pushing back , to fightthem . You spentthe colony 's money on this gold ... and sent ill-equipped armed forces out to be completely massacred ! Howmany more people must die ?

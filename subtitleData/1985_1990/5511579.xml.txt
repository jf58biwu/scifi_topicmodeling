 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the Visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food ! The Resistance is all that stands between us ... and the Visitors . Hold on . The bridge isn 't much further . Hurry up , Willie . We 've got to get him to Julie or he 's gonna die . That was excellent , Kyle . Thanks . Now let 's go ! - Where 'd you pick him up ? - Angel 's Crest . That 's 20 miles from here . The diphtheria is spreading all across the valley . We 've got a full scale epidemic on our hands . Take him inside . He 's going to need 15 CCs of ampicillin right away . - We just ran out of ampicillin . - What ? How could we ? You 've been treating a lot of sick people . We 've got to do something . We can 't let all these people die . There 's got to be ampicillin somewhere . There 's plenty . Only the Visitors have it under lock and key . Where ? The medical storehouse in town ... but there 's no way you can get it out of there . Not with just the handful of you . You 'd need some help . We can radio Donovan . He should be back from the refinery raid by tonight . I 'm afraid by the time he got here , it would be too late . Is there any Resistance unit still operating in this area ? I 'm not sure you 'd call them Resistance . The Wildcats are more like a street gang . - Who ? - The Wildcats . Just a bunch of kids . They do whatever it takes to survive . You can 't trust them . Mary , who can you trust nowadays ? If they 're fighters , we can use them . Where do I find these guys ? Go about halfway up Widow 's Canyon . The Wildcats will find you . Any sign of the Wildcats ? I have never seen a wildcat before . How do they feel about reptiles ? These Wildcats aren 't animals , Willie , they 're ... I take that back . Maybe they are animals . Out of the car , hotshot ! Not so fast . Let 's see you do it with your hands high in the air . Both of you . Don 't breathe . Turn around . You lost or something ? This is Wildcat country . No trespassers allowed . Sorry , I didn 't see the sign . I was told you were the guys to talk to . About what ? A little action . We 're going to hit the Visitor medical storehouse . You and what army ? - Hopefully yours . - No way , Jos√© . We have a major epidemic on our hands . Listen ... No , man , you listen to me . How do I know you 're not a lizard spy ? Yeah , let 's see what kind of green blood 's inside ! You want proof ? Here 's proof . Check it out , man . That 's pure old-fashioned American red . Look , the epidemic is spreading across the entire area . It could kill hundreds , maybe thousands , of your friends . We don 't have any friends . You can 't hide from diphtheria , man . It 's a plague . It 'll eventually catch up to you . You either fight it now , or die from it later . All right , let 's hear this brilliant plan of yours . I knew Charles had one last trick up his sleeve . It 's no trick , Diana . The galactic law is quite clear on the matter . In the event that a supreme commander is killed by an assassin ... the murderer is to be buried with him . And if no murderer is found ? Then all suspects shall be judged guilty ... and shall accompany Charles on his eternal voyage . But he 's being buried tomorrow . And so I intend to close this investigation by day 's end . We 're getting a readout , Inspector . A readout of what , may I ask ? The computer has examined the fingerprints ... found on the bottle of cat poison used in the assassination of Charles . Now it will generate an image from a photoactive breakdown of the prints . Really quite remarkable . We 're about to learn the identity of the murderer in this case . Look familiar ? This should bring it more clearly into focus . Marta ? She 's the ship 's pharmacist . I 'll speak to her at once . At this point , she may be your last hope . I 'm sorry it had to come to this . But as a servant of the law ... I 'm forced to place both of you under house arrest . I don 't know about this . Getting cold feet ? I just hope your buddy 's a good actor . Don 't worry . He 's got the role down pat . That shipment of ampicillin ready ? The one that goes to the collaborators . Yeah , they 're here for the pickup . It 'll just be a second . Cover me . We 're moving in for a closer look . Your brother always been this hard a guy ? He didn 't used to be like that . What happened ? Tony and I came home from school one day ... and we were all that was left of our family . Our parents were rounded up , taken away . Same with Bart and Andy . They even got Andy 's little brother . I 'm sorry . We 're talking history . The only thing that matters is the here and now . Like Tony says , no point in having dreams anymore . Not worth it . You don 't believe that , do you ? I don 't know what to believe anymore . - There you go . - Thank you very much . Get back . Ambush ! The rooftop ! Let 's get to the cars . We 've got the serum . Get out of here ! I had nothing to do with the murder of anyone ... let alone a supreme commander . Your fingerprints were found on the bottle of cat poison . Of course , I 'm the pharmacist . I held the bottle in my hands before I sold it to Lydia . Let me ask you another question . How well did you know Charles ? What were your feelings toward him ? Like every woman in the fleet ... I have admired him from afar . He was the supreme commander . He was handsome . But he had no idea I was even alive . There was nothing between us , I swear . I just wanted to tell you ... that was very heroic , what you did today . My name 's Ellen Baker . What 's yours ? Willie . Willie what ? Just Willie . That 's nice . How 's your friend ? She 'll be fine . The girl 's tough as nails . Listen , man , I 'm sorry about the way we came on to you . No hard feelings ? Whatever you say . You 'll see , Tony 's not such a bad guy . Why don 't you come out to our camp later ? We got reason to celebrate . No , you don 't . This isn 't ampicillin . It 's baking powder . Obviously , they knew you were coming . Somebody here is a spy . Now just a second , Doc . Who you pointing the finger at ? - ' Cause if it 's one of us ... - Take it easy . I don 't like being called a traitor . Especially by a bunch of outsiders . Yeah , we were getting along fine before you heroes showed up . We came because these people needed help . Kyle , radio Donovan and tell him what 's going on . Maybe he can get his hands on some ampicillin in Los Angeles . Yeah , but can he get it here in time ? Let 's hope so . Let 's pray so ! This is where we 'll cause the diversion . This is where we strike . When we move in , let 's concentrate our fire on the bridge . Mike ! Kyle on the box for you . It 's urgent . Be right back . Yeah , Kyle . You 're all okay ? For the moment ... but there 's a diphtheria epidemic in the valley ... and it 's spreading like wildfire . - What do you need ? - Ampicillin . As much as you can score , and fast . I 'll get a plane and the medicine . All you 've got to do is find me a place to land . I 'll let you know as soon as we do . Roger . I 'll be in touch . Excuse me , Inspector , but I must see Diana at once . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . She 's been placed under house arrest . Sir , it 's urgent . I 've just received word that Julie Parrish has been spotted in the Lassen Valley . With your permission ... I 'd like to track her down and finish her off myself . Of course . Go at once . This is all your fault . If you hadn 't poisoned him , none of this would have happened . Quiet ! This is no time for your petty complaints . The fact is , revolting as it may seem ... if we 're to survive , we must act as one . - Never . - Don 't be a fool . Marta will tell Philip you bought the cat poison . You 'll say I used it . And we 'll be right back where we started . What we need is a sacrificial lamb . Who do you have in mind ? Marta . What are you doing here ? I want you to know how sorry I am that ... our friendship has to end this way . How very thoughtful of you . It 's so unjust what 's happening . I know you both loved Charles very much . Was there anything else , Marta ? No . I 've got to go . If there 's anything I can do to help , please let me know . We will , dear . Diana , you wouldn 't . Do you wish to spend eternity ... floating through space with a rotting corpse ? If you don 't mind , I 'd like to hear the specifics of your strategy . I 'll handle the specifics , Lydia . You handle the guards ! I can 't believe there 's really a spy . I mean , the Wildcats are like a family . Family ? Yeah , you know ... like brothers and sisters , Mom and Dad , all rolled into one . Rolled into one ? Together . One for all , and all for one . I understand . That caring is what makes you so remorseful . Remorseful ? You mean " resourceful . " You 're too much , Willie . Yes , so I have been told . Hey ! What are you doing ? Big Brother 's back . I told you not to get friendly with them . I got the feeling these guys aren 't going to be around for long . We 'll be around long enough to get the job done . Which job ? Stopping the epidemic , or wiping out the Wildcats ? Maybe both . Yeah ? Easy . Easy . This airfield 's long enough for Donovan to land on , isn 't it ? As long as nobody knows he 's coming . Don 't push me . I have a suggestion . Why don 't we clear off the rocks and debris from the airstrip ? I 'm telling you , man , don 't push me . Where 's Bart ? Here he comes . Our spy just checked in . They 're scouting an airfield . - Do you have the location ? - Yes . They 'll be moving south from the field in a blue van . Excellent . Let 's crush them . Marta , you have been brought before me ... to answer certain grave charges against you . If they are substantiated ... your life must be forfeit . You see your accusers . What have you to say to refute the charge ... that you are the murderer of Charles , the late commander of the fleet ? I am innocent ! I 've been cruelly betrayed . This holo-video was found in your quarters . Roll tape , please . Charles , my love ... my lover ... How did you do it ? Lydia , when are you going to realize I 'm a very gifted woman ? I must have you ... or you must die . This is a frame ! I never made that thing . And yet that is you , your form , your voice , and your threat . What have you to say for yourself ? It 's a lie , a sham , all of it . A vicious trick played by those two fiendish hellcats . Name-calling will do nothing to disprove your guilt , Marta . Why not be gracious ? Admit everything and throw yourself on the mercy of the court . Never ! Then by the power vested in me ... I pronounce you guilty of Charles ' murder ... and sentence you to spend eternity with him in his sarcophagus . Make her ready . So far , so good . No sign of lizards anywhere . Maybe our luck will hold till Donovan gets here . It doesn 't look that way ! Hang on ! They 've cut us off . Hit the woods ! Quick ! Willie , get out of here ! What 's with you ? The lizards know every move you make . There 's too many of ' em . We gotta split . Meet back at the camp . Take off , I 'll cover you ! Help ! Help ! Put me down . Help ! Who said that ? Are you okay ? Willie ! You saved my life . I was just lucky . Not lucky . You 're fantastic ! Where did you learn to talk lizard ? Ellen , there is something we must talk about . - I know . - You know ? Willie ? This may sound totally nuts . I know we just met and everything ... but I like you a lot . Come on , we 'll talk later . Let 's get out of here . Hop in . We should have simply destroyed the van . They 've escaped in that forest . For the moment , probably , but it really doesn 't matter . The airstrip is a magnet that will draw them back to us . It 's where Donovan will have to land ... and they 'll all be there to try to protect him . So all that remains is for us to find out exactly when he arrives . And for that , you have your spy . So , you see , we really can 't lose . Can we ? I do like you . A lot . This was Grandma 's . She told me , before she died ... that when I met a man I really cared about ... I should give it to him . It is truly beautiful . But I can 't take it . You have to . I want you to . No , you do not understand . Ellen , I can 't take it because I 'm ... I 'm ... Married ? You 're married ? No . No , I 'm not married . That 's a relief . I am not ... I 'm not like other men . Yes . I know . That 's why I like you . The trouble is ... I am not ... human . What ? I 'm a Visitor . That 's my Willie , always joking . I am telling you the truth . Stop it , Willie . I 'm one of them . I 'm sorry . But I wanted to tell you . It is the truth . Get away from me ! Are you sure you want her to go out alive ? Not only alive , but conscious . I don 't want her in a procorb haze . But I 've never prepared anyone for a funeral service ... who was still breathing . Then it will be a memorable first . - But ... - No buts , Oswald . If she stops breathing , so do you . Mike , you just can 't risk it . One of the kids we 've been working with is a spy ... and he knows you 're on your way . I can 't abort , Julie . What about those sick people ? Mike , you 're not hearing me . The Visitors will probably be waiting for you . That 's a chance I 'll have to take . What if they shoot you out of the sky ? They won 't have much lead time . I 'm coming in on the deck , under the radar . I 'll see them before they see me . Be careful . We 'll try to provide some cover . I 'm counting on it . I 'll maintain radio silence from here on in . See you at 6 : 00 a.m. Take care . Out . Pretty good punch you threw there . You gotta keep your dukes up man . Somebody 's coming fast . Excuse , please ... Ellen has disappeared . She what ? We were talking , she got upset with me and ran away . I looked for her but ... You left her out there ? Alone ? In the dark ? You stupid ... A lizard ! No wonder ! Let 's waste him , Tony ! I can explain . That won 't be necessary . Okay , lizard , let 's have it . Where 's Ellen ? I told you . I don 't know . You 're lying again . Don 't even think of it . Shut your face , man . You been all fake around here . Willie 's one of us . He 's loyal . Yeah ? Well , maybe he 's one of you , but he ain 't one of us . Whatever else we are , we 're human . You 're making a big mistake . Not as big as the one your buddy made . He 's got my sister . No , he doesn 't . I see your sister . Yeah . Sure , you do ! Now , where is she ? How 'd she do that ? The same way she can " see " your sister . Now , do you want to talk about it or go find her ? She 's taken a fall . She 's trapped but she 's still alive . How can she know all that ? The point is she 's almost always right . Okay . Somebody stay here in case Ellen comes back . That 's me . All right . Let 's hit it . Hey , ladies first . Wait . I forgot my doctor 's kit . If she 's injured , we 'll need it . Go on , I 'll catch up to you . The plane 's on its way . Estimated time of arrival , 6 : 00 a.m. What about the Resistance fighters with you ? They 'll be meeting it at the airstrip . You realize what will happen if you 're lying to us ? I 'm not lying . I swear . Wait a minute . What about my brother ? You 're off the air , Andy . We 've lost him . I didn 't mean to rat on you . Look , you gotta listen . My brother 's under arrest . He 's got the plague . They promised to give him serum and let him go if I play along . Sit down ! Think about it . Do you have any idea what it 's like to see your brother dying ? So you decided to offer up your friends instead ? That 's a hell of a solution . They were gonna let him die slow . What else could I do ? You could have gone to your friends and asked for their help . And been turned down ? I doubt it . Bad times don 't make bad people , Andy . They make tough people . And they make cowards . Hands behind you , now ! How does she do it ? None of us knows , exactly . It is a kind of extra-sensory perception . Here ! She 's right here ! Help me . I 'm stuck . Ellen ? Are you all right ? I 'm okay , but not for much longer ! She 's trapped . Elizabeth , please , do something now . Come on ! Ellen , I 'm going to bring you out . You 've got to concentrate . Just think with me . Think about being free . Think ? Just do what she says ! She 's free ! Come on up . Easy . There 's your traitor . Oh , come on . Andy ? What are you , crazy ? Andy 's one of us . Tell her how off base she is , Andy . Go on , Andy , tell her . Maybe she 's setting all this up so she can save herself . Yeah , right . She sets up Andy . But you 're the real spy . That is it , isn 't it , Andy ? Come on , man , talk to me . Oh no , man , not you . How could you , man ? I 'm sorry . You gutless worm . I 'm gonna rip your lungs out . That 's not the way to operate . Right now we 've more important things to deal with . They 'll have an ambush set up at the airfield . What we 're gonna have to figure out is how to ambush the ambush . Come on , let 's get out of here . Sounds like Kyle and Willie got some of them . The man does have his licks down . Let 's move out . Go easy . We don 't know how much Andy told the ... Take cover ! Stay here . Let 's give ' em something to be mad about . You ready ? Let 's do it . Andy . OI ' Andy . I still can 't believe it . We got off light , thanks to Kyle and Willie . We could have run into a real buzzsaw here . And we just did . No way we can take on those odds . Okay , magician , do your stuff . I can 't , they 're too far away . Listen ! It 's Donovan ! He 's coming ! What are we gonna do ? We can 't just cut and run . They 'll shoot him down . You want to tell me how we handle them ? He 's on final . Too late to wave him off . We 've got to stand and fight and hope we can draw all their fire . He 's not stopping . He 's going for the truck like a torpedo . He may have made a mistake ... but when we really needed him , he was there . Give ' em a good chase . A minor adjustment in the flight plan . You 're a sight for sore eyes . One more time ! My compliments to the ground crew . We had plenty of help . Say hello to the Wildcats . The Fighting Wildcats . You 've got a free membership in our outfit anytime you want it . Now , I 'd say the first order of business is to get this medicine delivered . Right . Let 's hit it , people . Willie , I owe you an apology . No . I am not ... I can never be family ... like you and the Wildcats . Oh , yes , you are . Maybe not in body , but that doesn 't matter . You 're family in my heart . You ordered that she be conscious ? I wouldn 't want her to miss her own funeral . You really are a heartless , vicious beast . You 're too kind , Lydia . But don 't worry ... when the time comes , I 'll do the same for you . May the law prevail ... in death ... in life . Who sends him ? I do . - By what right ? - By right of marriage . I am his wife . Will you journey with him ? His murderess goes with him ! So it is written . So it shall be . May the heavens claim them . Marta looks so pale . Actually , I thought she never looked better .

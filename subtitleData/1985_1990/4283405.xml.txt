 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) Three million years from Earth , the mining ship Red Dwarf . Its crew : Dave Lister , the last human being alive ; Arnold Rimmer , a hologram of his dead bunkmate ; and a creature who evolved from the ship 's cat . Message ends . Additional . Our biggest enemy is going space-crazy through loneliness . The only thing that helps me maintain my grip on reality is the friendship I share with my singing potatoes . Nineteen . " When you are alone in bed , what do you wear ? " Is it : A , nothing at all ; " B , a flannelette nightie ; " or C , a sexy black negligee ? " C. Twenty . " Do you think your boobs are ... A , too small ; " B , just right ; or C , too large ? " Definitely too large ! So , what 's my rating ? " Mainly Cs . You sure are one foxy lady . " Sexy , sensual and don 't mind showing it . " Yes ! I 'm a sex beast ! ( CAT WAILS TUNELESSLY ) Do you mind ? ! - What ? - I 'm trying to concentrate . - ( WAILS ) I can 't hear you . - What are you listening to ? It 's hot , man . ( WAILS ) " Robert Hardy reads Tess Of The D 'Urbervilles " ? ! Let 's have a listen . ( BOTH WAIL TUNELESSLY ) The tape must have got twisted , man ! This is really good ! ( SHOUTS ) Excuse me ! I 'm in the middle of a tactical calculation , which could swing the game . - Rimmer , you 've lost , man . - There 's plenty of play . - There 's one move , then he zaps you . - Admittedly , that is how it looks . But you 're not taking into consideration that El Skutto here has to go back on duty in four minutes , 31 seconds , and if he goes before the game finishes , I win by default . Four minutes , 15 . ( CHANTS ) Rimmer ! Rimmer ! You 're a piece of dirty , filthy , cheating scum , aren 't you ? Absolutement ! That 's why I 'll win , because I think my way round problems , rather than sticking to the pre-programmed lines . That 's why men are better than machines . Oh , I don 't know . I had this geography teacher , Miss Foster . She took us camping to Deganwy . I had the tent next to hers , right ? In the night , I was woken up by this really weird noise . SHE didn 't think men were better than machines . - What 's happening , then , dudes ? - Bog all . - I forgot what I was going to say . - It can 't be important , then . ( THUNDEROUS CRASH ) That 's it . " Look out , a meteor is about to hit the ship . " - I knew it would come back to me . - Thanks ! - Sorry . - What 's wrong with you , Holly ? - He 's computer-senile . - Is there any damage ? I don 't know . The damage report machine 's damaged . - Where did it hit ? - All my monitors are out . Round about floor 591 , I think . You 're as much use as a condom machine in the Vatican . Nothing here . Let 's try 592 . Er ... Has anybody seen my legs ? They 're not below my waist where I normally keep them . - Holly , where are Rimmer 's legs ? - Here they are right here ! - Stop them ! - C 'mon , leggies . Over here . Of course . 592 . That 's where the hologram simulation suite is . - What does this mean ? - It 's probably not serious . If it 's not serious when your genitals wander off on their own , what is ? Wait for me-me-me-me-me-me ! Here it is . 592 . Rimmer , are you all right ? ( ODD HIGH-PITCHED VOICE ) Well , you see , the shuttle was late . And they 're usually so good . They 're so good . They 're brilliant . What 's happened to him ? - He 's Brannigan , ship 's psychiatrist . - We 'd better get him fixed . ( ALARM BEEPS ) I 've got it in hand . No panic . ( AS HOLLY ) No panic everyone . I 've got it in hand . ( HOLLY ) Just override the charred relays . - Just override the charred relays . - How do you do that ? - ( AS LISTER ) How do you do that ? - Bypass the main circuit . ( AS HOLLY ) Bypass the main circuit . - This one ? - ( AS LISTER ) This one ? - Yeah , that one . - Yeah , that one . - Now press the bypass . - Now press the bypass . ( YELPS ) That was horrible . I never want to go through that again ! Aow ! Aow ! Hey ! Now he 's me ! Stick the red plug in the blue socket . ( RIMMER YELPS ) - Am I OK now ? - ( HOLLY ) Yeah . Shouldn 't this plug into something ? Oh , yeah , that joins up with the white cable . ( CRACKLING , LISTER YELLS ) .. or is it the yellow cable ? Yes , it should have been yellow . You are a total , total ... a word has yet to be invented to describe you , but you are one , and a total one at that . Keep your hair on . - I 'm lucky to keep my legs on . - He 's out to lunch . He 's out to lunch , breakfast , dinner , the lot ! He 's not in for a single meal . - Hey , who 's that ? - Aliens ! - QueegI - Who 's Queeg ? I 'm Queeg 500 , the back-up computer . All vessels of the Jupiter Mining Corporation fleet carry a back-up computer to replace the primary computer if the primary computer contravenes Article 5 . I am therefore assuming control . This is mutiny , Mr Queeg . You 'll swing from the highest yardarm in Titan Docking Port for this . What 's Article 5 ? Gross negligence , leading to the endangerment of personnel . - But Holly has an IQ of 6,000 ! - ( HOLLY ) Right on . - Is that what he told you ? - Well , what is it ? It has a six in it , but it 's not 6,000 . - What is it ? - Six . Six ? Do me a lemonI That 's a poor IQ for a glass of waterI How come he knows all about science and space when we ask him ? - He consults a book . - What a slimeballI He gets all his information on science from a single book . - What book ? - Junior Encyclopaedia Of Space . It 's the only one he could find with pictures . That 's slander , that is . You 'd better find a good lawyer , guy . - That 's why he 's never on the case ! - I am on the case . I 'm sharp . I 'm kicking bottom . How come he can navigate us back to Earth ? He can 't . You 've been going around in circles for 14 months . - You what ? - A load of Tottenham , that is . A steaming pile of Hotspur . I 'm on to his game . He 's turning you against me , so he can take over . No discussions . The decision has been made . You 've been bypassed . You 've been retired . - I 'm in my primeI - You 'll be nightwatchman . From now on , Red Dwarf is run by Queeg 500 . Queeg to all personnel . Course redirection implemented . New bearing 057-776 . Message ends . Ah , Lister , this is a bit different , isn 't it ? See those skutters , charging up and down the corridor , repairing , sweeping ? The lifts are fixed . The fire extinguishers work . And I mean they work when you turn them on , as opposed to when you happen to pass them and cough . Yeah , I suppose . There 's no point feeling sorry about Holly . It 's a kindness . He 's like an old incontinent sheepdog who 's had his day . Take him out to the barn with a shotgun and blow the mother away . I 'm only saying that because I 'm fond of him . - How do you think Holly feels ? - He doesn 't feel anything . He 's a computer . He still feels . Sometimes I think it 's cruel giving machines a personality . My mate bought a pair of shoes with artificial intelligence . Smart Shoes , they were called . No matter how blind drunk you were , they could always get you home . He got ratted one night in Oslo , and woke up the next morning in Burma . See , the shoes got bored . They wanted to see the world . He couldn 't get rid of them . Whenever he sold them , they 'd show up again the next day and kick the door down . - Is this true ? - Yeah . Last thing he heard , they 'd robbed a car and driven into a canal . - They couldn 't steer . - Really ? Yeah . Petersen was blown away about by it . He went to see a priest . He said that the shoes had gone to heaven . It turns out shoes have " souls " . Well , what a sad , sad story . Wait a minute ... How did they open the car door ? ( ALARM ) Off ! Uh , Queeg ? Why has my alarm clock gone off at six o 'clock ? That 's the time you asked for . Holly and I had this little understanding . I 'd say , " Wake me up at six without fail , " then Holly would pretend to forget , and wake me around ten with breakfast . OK ? ( ALARM SOUNDS ) Off ! Queeg , I can see we 've already cultivated a special understanding - I scratch your back and you stick a knife in mine . - Give me a uniform . - Exercises first . Ah , yes . Now once again , Holly and I had this understanding ... ( QUEEG ) Move it , boyI What are you doing ? ! I 'm putting you through the regulation 500 jerks . - Stop it . - Then it 's a three-mile run . You just can 't take control of my body ! The company pays for your hologramatic survival . In space , I AM the company . - Lister , wake up ! Help ! - What 's going on ? Queeg ! He 's making me fit ! What are you doing ? ! My stomach won 't take it ! It 's too flabby ! - OneI - Mummy ! - TwoI ThreeI - Mercy ! Help me ! - FourI - Holly and I had an understanding ! Yes ! Fight that flab ! I want my body back ! Three more hours will kill me ! I 'm going to faint ! I said food ! Is anybody home ? What 's the matter with him ? He fainted after the first 500 yards . - You made him jog unconscious ? - It 's regulations . Yes ! Nice one , Queeg ! Right . 0700 . Time for astronavigation revision . I 'd better wake him . ( SLAPPING SOUND ) Revise and learn pages 25 to 59 . You will then be tested . If you fail , tomorrow you do five miles . I am now returning control of your body . ( MUTTERS ) Hey , I can 't get any food ! - Try a different machine . - I did . " You have run out of credits . " - They 've all gone crazy ! - Queeg , what 's happened ? Article 497 . When a crewmember runs out of credit , food may not be supplied until the balance is restored . Nah . Listen , me and Holly , we had this little understanding ... - If you want food , you have to work . - Work ? ! You 'd better start . I 'm one hungry pussycat . - Both of you . - Whoa ! I don 't do the " W " word . Cats do NOT work ! I 've got a note from my mommy . - From now on , EVERYBODY worksI - Not this pussy ! I can 't believe I 'm doing this ! Look at me ! I 'm disgusting ! I 'm like you in your best clothes ! Look , it 's easy . Just imagine the floor is Queeg 's face . ( BOTH SPIT ) Aw , look at my hands ! I had lovely hands ! - Well , wear the smegging gloves ! - Marigolds with blue ? Are you crazy ? - How long do we have to do this ? - It 's only been ten minutes . - We 've got to do it all day . - What ? ! All day ? The whole day ? I 'm a cat . If I don 't nap , I don 't have enough energy for my main snooze . haiti Who goes there ? Friend or foe ? - Holly ! - How you doin ' ? Let me wipe your screen . - So , how 's it going ? - What you been up to , man ? Oh , this nightwatchman lark keeps me busy . Shining me torch down corridors . Turning it off . Shining it again . Life 's pretty full . - Help us , Hol . - Queeg has got to go ! Look at my cuticles . He 's a maniac . ( BREATHLESS ) I agree ! He 's got us working for food . Well , no doubt he knows what he 's doing , unlike certain senile wrecks of computers we could mention . Still , it was nice how everyone defended me . - Different story now . - I defended you . I remember . Queeg says I 've got an IQ of six , and you leap to my defence , saying , " Really ? That explains everythingI " - No . That was Rimmer ! - Nevertheless , certain characters don 't believe my IQ is 6,000 . - I believe you . - I could prove it . - There 's no need . - I want to . OK , what 's the square root of 2,049 ? - Oh , you want me to prove it ? - No , no . Clearly doing the square root of 2,049 will prove I have an IQ of 6,000 . - What is it ? - You wouldn 't prefer a sports question ? - Forget it . It 's not important . - It is to me . I want to clear my name . Well , what is the square root of 2,049 ? - How about a space question ? - Like what ? Like , " What 's the nearest planet to the sun ? " - What 's the nearest planet to the sun ? - Easy-peasy . That 's right down my particular field of expertise . Your nearest basic planet to your actual sun is ... Mercury . - That 's right . - Ye of little faith . - Well , I 'm convinced . - Me , too . Can we get rid of Queeg ? Do you believe I 'm the right dude for the gig ? - Yeah . - I 'll be in touch . ( WHISTLES GREAT ESCAPE THEME ) He 's taking the smeg ! - Who is ? - Queeg . Look at what he 's given me . A pea on toast . One pea . I tell you , I 'm that far from cracking . I 've lost me pea ! Oh , that 's it ! I 've cracked . He 's just doing this to destroy your morale . Is he ? Well , I want me pea back . I earned that pea ! Where is it ? I don 't care if it 's under the bed with me toenail clippings , I earned it . I 'm going to eat it , no matter what . It flew into your dirty sock basket . I 'll just have the toast . - Why didn 't we stick up for Holly ? - I did . You did ? ! When ? - All right , I didn 't . - Nobody did . It 's terrible . We thought we 'd get something better . What about trust ? What about fidelity ? What about simple , basic , honest friendship ? Friendship ? Do you know how many people I can count as true friends ? Well , if you count Inflatable Ingrid , your Polythene Pal , one . I 'll tell you . None . I got burned once and I learned my lesson . Don 't trust anybody . There was this one lad , Porky Roebuck . I 'd known him ten years . We were almost family . His dad was knocking off my mum , that 's how close we were . - We were in the Space Scouts together . - Space Scouts ? Oh , yes ... Pinkle ! Squirmy ! Blip-blap-blap ! We were 15 years old . We went on this survival course , sleeping rough , surviving on wild berries and rainwater . - Where did you go ? Butlins ? - We each got a Swiss Army knife . You only ate what you killed yourself . Ten boys got together and decided to eat me . They tied me to a stake , lit a fire and poured barbecue sauce all over me . I remember thinking as I went round and round , " Porky will save me . He 's my best friend . " It turned out Porky was the ringleader and had bagsied my right buttock . If it wasn 't for the Space Mistress , they really would have eaten me . Oh , come on . They were only bullying you . You know what kids are like . The point is , friends are only friends when it suits them . Oh ... Lights . - Lister ? - Yeah ? How did you know about Inflatable Ingrid ? I 've been seeing her behind your back . - Compute . - Compute . The product of the correlation of vx / dy minus the sum of the set v1 over the sum of r , given that r is a ratio of p over s and s is an integer variable . - Just one small question ... - Yes ? What does " compute " mean ? Just do itI And you two , stop shirking and get workingI # Do not forsake me , oh , my love # I only know I must be brave # For I must face the man who hates me # Or I will cower in my grave ... # Queeg . I want my ship back . - Too bad . - You 'll have to fight for her . Hol , this man 's a nutter . - I challenge you to the game of your choice . - Oh , my God . - The winner gets command of Red Dwarf . - And the loser ? The loser will be erased , terminated , oblivionised . - Bye-bye , baldy . - Name your game . - Chess . - Any game . - Chess . - Draughts , poker ... anything . - Chess . - Subbuteo , snakes and ladders ... - Chess . - Monopoly , maybe ? - ChessI - Like chess , do you ? Transfer me to the monitor . Don 't do this . You 'll get rubbed . A computer 's gotta do what a computer 's gotta do . Let battle commence . - Pawn to King 4 . - Horsie to King Bish 3 . It 's called a knight , actually , Holly . - Knight to King Bishop 3 . - Queen to Rook 8 . Checkmate . - That 's an illegal move . - Oh , sorry . I was thinking of poker . Cluedo ? You can be Colonel Mustard . Psst ! If it 's any help , I 've been studying his tactics and there 's a pattern - every time you make a move , he makes one , too . Thanks , Cat . Pawn to King 4 . Knight to King Bish 3 . - Bishop to Knight 5 . - Horsie takes King prawn . - Pawn to Queen 5 . - Horsie to Bish 3 . - Bishop ... - .. to Queen 3 . - .. takes pawn . - Prawn to King 4 . ( HOLLY ) Horsie to Bish 3 . - Prawn takes Horsie . - Bishop-pawn takes pawn . - Bish takes prawn . - Bishop to Knight 5 . Double check and mate , suckerI - Oh , yeah . I didn 't see that . - Holly , what have you done ? - He 's lost . - And the loser gets erased . Noughts and crosses ? What kind of plan was that ? A stupid plan , that 's what it was . - Why didn 't we stop him ? - We thought he had something up his sleeve . Now we 've got Queeg forever , and that 's a long time . - Well , dudes , I 've come to say goodbye . - You 're definitely getting rubbed ? - ' Fraid so . - Life 'll be hell ! Well , see you , Dave . - Hope it works out with Kochanski . - Cheers , Hol . See you , Cat . I hope you fulfil your heart 's desire and get your end away . Thanks , man . And Arnold ... I hope you meet those aliens and get a body , get a sex life and all the rest you feel you need . Thanks , Hol . Well , I hate long goodbyes . Perhaps next time you 're down the disco , you 'll raise a glass to old Holly and think , " Things weren 't too bad with him . " Perhaps not the most efficient computer , but we had a giggle . " - Oh , one last thing ... 45.265881 . - What ? That 's the square root of 2,049 . I may not be fast , but I get there . Well , as they always say , finish on a song . # I 'll say goodbye to love # No one ever cared if I should live or die # Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by ... # OK , suckers , get this into your stupid thick heads . - I 've got one thing to say . - What ? What 's happening , dudes ? We are talking Jape of the Decade . We are talking April , May , June , July and August Fool . Yes , that 's right . I am Queeg . ( ALL ) What ? ! Queeg never existed . It was me all along . - ( ALL ) WHAT ? ! - Wheeze of the week , mate . - It was a joke ? ! - Going in circles for 14 monthsI Getting information from the Junior Encyclopaedia of SpaceI Your respect for me is awesome . You mean you staged the whole thing ? ( QUEEG 'S VOICE ) That 's right , suckersI ( NORMAL VOICE ) The moral is appreciate what you 've got , because basically , I 'm fantasticI # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

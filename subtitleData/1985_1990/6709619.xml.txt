You 're on the air . in order . that 's not right . But just for calling we 're ... . that 's not funny . We 've talked about this . but I better not get another phone bill like last month 's . let 's see what we came up with last night . A fish ? One fish ? and you come back and all you want to tell me about is one fish ? you have to want to talk to me . I know . You have to want to talk to me about the things that you see . when you leave the pool and go out into the ocean . About your entire world . Or else the money guys 'll pull the plug . You get it ? They 'll pull the plug . don 't think for a minute that they won 't . They will . Now I want you to go on back out there and come back with something that 'll really knock their socks off . Alright . Just one . Sittin ' and a-singin ' the blues you got nothin ' to lose Won 't ya let me take you on a sea cruise baby baby baby Won 't ya let me take you on a sea cruise hah hah Those wild and crazy scientific guys — I love ' em those Misfits ... Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! I do want to help . We 're just really too busy right now . I can see how busy you are . Glo . Which way 'd it go ? Doctor Hayes ? The Elastic Man called to tell you his wife gave birth to a bouncing baby boy . Billy ! but he can 't tell if it 's working . I am serious about this . I wanna learn more about my powers . this color 'd look great on you . Miss Nance . I think it 's a turning point in my maturity . okay ? I happen to think maturity is a very important thing . Where the hell 's my little car ? do you remember what we talked about ? okay ? Counterclockwise . Thanks . okay ? Even on a weekend . Glo : I really have something to talk to you about . sorry . listen . What — Sorr — Gloria . Hi . What is this ? I keep getting all these invoices for toys . Richard . this is the one that those vice cops drive on TV . huh ? Billy . there it is . Terrific . hold this for me would you ? Thanks . Saaay . do you or don 't you think it 's important that I learn about my power ? I mean how it works . that 's why we were working with you huh ? not me . I think I 'm old enough now to take responsibility for my own life . right ? you 're absolutely right . as soon as we finish this — but do you ever do anything that brings in money ? I 'm really offended by that . I tell ya . Haven 't I ever shown you the Physician 's Friend ? this is a complete biodiagnostics machine . All-in-one . push this one little button . somebody get the fire extinguisher . Does it come in different colors ? Do you mind ? I 'm on the phone . Dick : The new cordless phone . Billy ... Eddie . Slow — slow down . El : Now why would they threaten to take away your grant ? and then ask me . The National Tattler ? ! Are you kidding ? I wouldn 't read that sensationalistic piece of low-brow garbage if it was the last paper on — I 'll get Billy 's copy . Eddie . How could you get suckered into — okay ? if the Delta Foundation pulls the plug on me now for shooting off at the mouth ... I told them that I 'm working on something very big . Maybe bigger than the both of us . if you know what I mean . And I think you do . And nobody believes me ! but — But I knew you would . You always did . Remember ? Right . all I 'm asking for is some forward movement . Some — some progress . A commitment to some kind of result . Something I can show the board ! Richard . You know something ? You 're right . get it done completely . let 's go . I have something interesting . I 'm in . okay ? Yeah . Do you think that – in a parallel universe – they all respect me ? Eddie : I 'm sorry I brought you guys down here all this way for nothing . El : You mean your project is just dead ? Just like that ? Belly up " is how the guy put it . I guess this newspaper article was the last straw . did you show ' em the pictures you told me about ? Yeah . And they said it doesn 't matter . Everyone except my friend Sherri . She tried to talk ' em out of it because it does matter . Especially now . you 'll see . You 'll believe me . walruses . listen . Talking dolphins ? Are you so sure we should be here ? ' Cause something tells me this guy 's no rocket scientist . like us . Now let 's just go meet Donald . Am I dressed okay ? These pictures are all computer translations of what Donald is seeing on his ocean trips . this is really incredible . it 's simple . Once you know that dolphins speak in kind of ' word pictures ' . and then they store it . what ? Sonic induction ? 'echoloquation ' . You said to call if they showed anybody the dolphin . Yeah . What do I think ? I think you should get over here . Is anybody in here ? Eddie . I thought I heard someone . this is Sherri from the Delta Foundation . I told you about her . These are my friends . okay . Just checking . Bye . uh ... It looks like you got things pretty much under control here . You 're doing a good job . air . excuse me ? Excuse me ? right ? right . it 's too bad about that project thing . I mean . Mr ... ? Doctor Billy . Just Billy . I really have to — uh ... stuffed walrus . I found Donald . When he was just a baby . he was stranded on some rocks . Since then we 've been working just about day and night to prove to them that we know what we 're doing . Nobody takes us a bit seriously – except Sherri . We do . maybe . But not your friend . he 's like that at first . he takes his science very seriously . ma 'am ? I think you dropped your walrus . Thanks . Eddie tells me that you went to bat for him on this thing but what can I do ? the Foundation says he has " no credibility " . And then they said I had no more credibility . Credibility ! Three years of research and finally I 'm getting results that mean something and they don 't wanna hear about it ! Donald knows something . Why would a dolphin lie ? the dolphin only talks to him . uh ... " skewed his results " . what if Eddie was right about this skeleton thing ? it 's a moot point – Delta 's pulling out . this place 'll be a circus . Donald goes back to San Francisco first thing tomorrow . They took him away once before . And he pined . It might be worse if they do it again . I don 't know what 's gonna happen to us . to Donald ? that 's what I mean . you know ? I think I can even convince this place into letting me finish my work here . I 'm sure they 'd be happy to have Donald here . they want ' im moved . but aren 't dolphins pretty sensitive to things like that ? but dolphins can love . he sometimes pines . Maybe even dies . Donald loves ... what happens when you take away something Eddie loves ? taking the dolphin " ? ! Donald is mine ! Eddie . Sherri tried to talk ' em out of it . No one is taking him ! He won 't work with anybody else . Nobody else can make ' im work . He won 't even talk to anybody else . Eddie — El : Billy . Conference . Eddie 's right . This is the only dolphin in the world that can do this . And who knows what 'll happen to Donald if they take him away from Eddie ? who knows what 's gonna happen to Eddie ? Right . My question is ... What are we gonna do about it ? We 're gonna steal a what ? What ? You act like that 's so weird or something . Why do you think I asked you to bring the truck ? Did you empty the freezer ? but don 't dolphins live in water ? Remember I have this little thing with water ? okay ? I 'm just asking you to do this one little thing . there 's a problem . The door 's got an electronic combination lock . and you 're clear . B-Man . you know ? Whoa . Eddie : Get the computer printouts and Donald 's pictures . Flamingo ... bro . b-bro . How ' bout one of those snow cones . no . We 're-we 're out . Uh ... how ' bout a fudgesicle ? we 're out . Sorry . Drumstick ? uh ... melted . How ' bout a fifty-fifty bar ? I-I haven 't got those either . They 're gone . Kiss bar ? Johnny : All out . All out . Come on . Right over there . Officer : How ' bout a push-up ? we don 't have any push-ups . No . How ' bout a bingo bar ? alright ? We don 't have anything . We 're out . Well then just what do you got in this freezer ? Fishsticks . smart punk . kick it . Hayes . Did you say this dolphin thing had somethin ' to do with flamingos ? why ? Cause that car over — never mind . Come on ! Okay . So what now ? only now it 's easy . Get me the dolphin . Donald . I found it . This whole chapter on exper — Experiments we can do without it costing Humanidyne hardly anything . hi . well can you — Can I leave Sherri my number here then ? thanks . I 'm try — She 's crazy about me . Great . we take the toys and we take ' em apart and we take out their radio-control jobbies . Now that saves us about nine-hundred bucks each . you 're doing work with radiowaves ? not radiowaves . High-frequency soundwaves operate the motors . Oh ! That 's like when Donald turns on the telephone . my grandmother has a canary who can open a garage door two blocks away . Glo . It really is . you said I could do this . then I can learn to use it in a good way and not be af — Dick : Billy . I got something I think you will appreciate . Gloria . Dick . right ? And — and — and how you 're always looking for weird little mysteries to solve ? or what ? Dick Stetmeyer . Eddie . how are you ? I want you to take a look at this . Dick : Stolen dolphin . Is that something ? Just think what it would be like if you found it . just think what it would mean to the relationship between Delta and Humanidyne and what you ... What are you doing here ? Nothing . Hayes . this thing happened faster than I thought . 'flamingo ' thing . is there anything you wanna tell me ? Hah ! That 's not even a picture of Donald . Who are they kidding ? What are you doing to me ? Stolen dolphins ! we just borrowed it . And we 're pretty sure it 's trying to tell us something . a talking stolen dolphin . That 's a lot better . Maybe he can testify at your arraignment ! Richard . We think he was trying to show us something . Flamingos . They 're nice . And a skeleton . I remain unimpressed . You committed a crime – a major crime – in the name of Humanidyne . Humanidyne . That 's humans . That 's Homo sapiens ! It 's not — I refuse to believe that there 's any possible connection between you and some talking flamingo ! Talking dolphin . - Donald but I-I promise you there is no significance in a dolphin babbling about flamingos . None ! Flamingo Club . El : I just don 't see why we needed this car . 'Cause I checked with Jane . She said this place is known for serious drug traffic . Billy . Drugs ? she said she won 't even let her people near the place . there 's a certain ... ' image ' you gotta have . You know ? They expect it . Don 't you ever watch TV ? Why are we dealing with drug people anyway ? shouldn 't we be talkin ' to the police ? And tell them what ? We got a hot tip from a well-connected dolphin ? There are a lot of unanswered questions here . how did that dolphin know to call this place ? soldiers and the law the things nobody saw or hash You gotta carry weapons ' cause you always carry cash lots of dirty deals Every name 's an alias in case somebody squeals Smuggler 's blues Me and you this whole thing is making me — Are you listening to me ? El ? you think Sherri 'd go for this look ? What d 'you think ? Doctor Crockett . Doctor Tubbs . how ' bout your friend at DMV ? it 's probably nothing ' . I didn 't wanna say anything to Hayes till I checked it out . I 'm writin ' . his name 's Chuck Pisarcik ? One-eighty Dunhill Court . yeah . met him at a party . what was his name ? Uh ? Uh ... Chuck . Chuck ! Chuck . Nice guy . Really nice guy . So . I hear you looking for Chuck . before you can talk to Chuck . uh ... Let 's talk . how many keys are you selling ? 'Keys ' ? How many keys are we selling ? uh ... just the one . You guys only have one key ? um ... It 's a big key . They all just say that it 's natural for adolescents to want to know about how their bodies work Somehow I don 't think that 's what they had in mind . I sure wish I had a special talent . You do . You talk to dolphins . but nobody takes that seriously . sure they do . then they would 've taken me with them . It 's my dolphin . It 's my research . But now they 're off doing the follow-up . it 's just like always . Eddie does all the work and then along comes somebody else and takes all the credit . Billy and El are not like that . that 's how it 'll work out . that people use to figure things out . A home computer with glasses . huh ? That 's exactly the way I feel sometimes . why don 't you blow away those guys ' guns ? " . Guns " ? right ? Glo : I 've never even said that before . About me being different . huh ? Hello ? is that you ? Sherri . I was returning Billy 's call . He left this number . Delta knows you took Donald . I kinda figured that they did . too . But I 've got an idea how to get you out of this . I think I can get ' em to take the project back . Really ? Are you serious ? I am . but I 'm pretty sure . and we 'll see if he leads us to the flamingos . How ' bout it ? What do you think ? You think he 'd do it for you ? I know he would . can you get him out and meet me there ? Yes . If I can get some help . Uh-oh . El : I should have known this is where your plan would 've led us . El . okay ? and I 'll come in and I 'll help you look around . Billy . If this guy comes back and we don 't have a real reason for being in there ... right ? okay ? what are you wearing ? Malibu Ken . Billy and El said for us to wait here till they get back . they 'll call if they find anything . by then it 'll be too late . Donald and I have worked for three years on this project . then ... we 'll do it without you . Yes . Yes ? Yes ! El : And that 's the flamingo connection . This guy Chuck is shipping in coke in plastic flamingos and the ones Donald saw in the ocean are probably full of the stuff . Eddie was right ! The guy 's a hero ! And — what is it ? I picked up the remote beeper for the phone in case Billy calls in . huh ? it explains how Donald knew how to call this number . El : He must have heard Sherri dial it from the Ocean Center . we have got to tell Eddie – he doesn 't know this . We gotta warn ' im . he wouldn 't do anything stupid like — Billy ! You 're right . let 's get back to the lab . huh ? Humanidyne would be the first to know . Mr. Stetmeyer . Call me Dick . And what he saw last night was an ice cream truck . With no ice cream . And a red light on top . Those are all over the city . and that 's where I 'm going to start . we have nothing to hide . don 't go in there ! the boys like to swim . An — and they told us upstairs it was alright — Where is it ? Where — where is what ? The dolphin . It isn 't here ? it isn 't here . Then how do you explain this ? Stetmeyer . I have some bad news for you . Your fish died . Great . but the phone machine 's on . they rushed outta here . Th — they went to some bar on the marina . What bar ? I dunno . The ' flamingo ' something . 'Flamingo ' ... what have they done ? but I think they 're sittin ' on somethin ' pretty important . El . Just thought I 'd share that with you . Thank you for sharing . First I find out the girl of my dreams is playing house with Scarface . Then I end up tied to a toilet . I woke up in such a good mood . Eddie could be in big trouble . what about us ? You know what I think ? What ? right ? Right . just suppose one of his planes didn 't make it all the way in one night . Then that means that the skeleton that Donald saw is probably the pilot . and Donald 's the only one who knows where they are . they 're gonna end up little ripples in a big pond . we 'll just have to get to Eddie first . think . What would Sonny Crockett do in a situation like this ? Shrink . El . no . I mean me . I think I can hit my head on these pipes back here . let me see . Ow ! El . wait . Just a minute . be careful . Don 't hit the — El ? El ? big guy ! Hi . If you ever tell anyone what happened in there ... okay ? It could happen to anyone . Just stay cool . I figure Chuck 's long gone by now . A few more feet and we 're home free . Excuse me . Nice chicken . it was just a rental ! Billy : Down ! I 'm a college graduate . P.H.D. Good grades . I coulda been anything I wanted . nobody shoots at you ! B-Man . get over here . We gotta warn Chuck . Called . You were out . no argument . Did you go by the lab ? Were Glo and Eddie there ? but no one was around . What about Donald ? I don 't think so . Oh great . Chuck 's probably taking ' ' em for a boat ride . We gotta get down to the docks now . I can take one of ya . I 'll catch up . Alright . Delivery Guy : Uh ... hey ! Uh ... Hold on . Hold on . I 'm just renting it . okay ? I 'm just gonna rent it . here . Here-here-here . Here 's the money . Now take it . Here 's the money . I really thought she liked me . I thought we had something . Who ? Sherri . Who 's Sherri ? An international drug dealer . Remind me to talk to you about where to look for women . where 're we going ? this guy 's got a boat . We saw pictures of it and we hope it 's down at the marina . What 's it called ? Snow Queen . Donald . This is the big one . Okay ? Go for it ! Hope your boat is fast . Hey ! What are you doing ? ! run ! Eddie ! we 're running out of time . Let 's move . no ! They 've got Eddie . They won 't hurt Eddie . They need ' im . we 've only got one boat left . Fine . We 'll take it . You have to fill out this form . we 're in a hurry . Forms is forms . Glo . You know that ? alright ? What was I supposed to do ? in the lab . Like I told you . Like you know so much . Right . Billy . You didn 't have to help . would any of this happened ? Huh ? No ! I need a major credit card . let 's go . this is a boat . Maybe this is not such a great idea for you . I know it 's a boat . You just steer and let me worry about it . I 'm goin ' . keys . El ? Yeah ? How d 'ya drive a boat ? I don 't know . Just try it in the — El : Straight . starboard ! Left ! Left ! Johnny : It 's a dead end ! port ! Billy : Just say ' right ' or ' left ' ! Billy ! okay ? El : Okay . Steady as she goes . Steady as she goes " ? I 'll steady you as you go . you shouldn 't feel bad . I know your boyfriend put you up to this . You wouldn 't be doing this if it was just you and me . I know that for a fact . it doesn 't matter to me . Just get whatever you want and take us back . Donald and I 'll start all over someplace . Donald won 't leave with me here . No matter what . And I don 't want anything to happen to him . 'Cause he didn 't do anything . You know ? So you 'll take us back . Right ? Right ? El . What 's not working ? Blockin ' out the fear . Of the water . but then it comes back . you shouldn 't forget . It 's part of you . Nothin ' wrong with knowing your limitations . There we go . Just look at this ! Lord have mercy I just wanted you guys to take me seriously . You did ? Yeah . I wanted to show you I was old enough to make decisions . People have always decided things for me . Jane tells me what I can do . And you guys tell me what to do . I thought I was mature enough to decide the right thing . On my own . Guess I 'm not . you did the right thing . You did . El was right – we fell down on the job . you were the only one who saw who the really important one was here . We gonna find ' im ? I don 't know . when did you make up this plan ? wait . Why did you stick up for me ? With Delta . okay ? right ? right ? right ? Wrong ! Eddie ? Huh ? Does it ? Sherri . We 're not turning around . are we ? Eddie ! Donald . This is gonna hurt . Get that beeper ! go ! No ! we know Donald came out here . There 's no telling where he ended up . Johnny : We shoulda called the Coast Guard when we had a chance . Did I know the radio was broken ? So what now ? We just give up ? Hey ! look ! Am I supposed to know one dolphin from another ? He wants — he wants us to follow ' im . like Lassie ? like Flipper . Am I the only guy around here that watches TV ? he wants to take us somewhere . Gloria : Up there ! Chuck ! Donald . Chuck ! Where is it ? I dunno . Billy . We gotta get Eddie ! slow down ! you 've been practicing . go ! we gotta do something . Nice job ! Donald . Where is Donald ? Billy : Guess we gotta get back and call the Coast Guard . Okay ! Does anybody know where we are ? Here you are . I get a completely new audio system . Built in . they 're gonna give me a completely new video system . With three more monitors . And cable TV . huh ? not just me and Donald any more . What do you mean ? I got to thinking that maybe it 's not such a good idea for me to be Donald 's only friend . did you get Donald a girlfriend ? I had nothing to do with it . She followed him home one night . that 's what he told me . even Donald gets to have a girlfriend . You want a date with a dolphin ? I 'll fix you up . you know what I 'm talkin ' about . you know ? Sherri . you know ? all she was thinking about ... was a fish . Don 't put yourself down . A dolphin 's a mammal . I 'll show you my new parking space . baby baby baby Won 't ya let me take you on a sea cruise Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Misfits Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy Electric and alive Love you for your mind I can feel it ! straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies

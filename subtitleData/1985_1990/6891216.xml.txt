I feel terrible . Well , just kick back and relax , doctor should be here any minute . Where is this ? Highland Hospital . Where are my clothes ? We won 't be needing them for a while . Yes , we will . I mean that I will . My son doesn 't know where I am . One thing at a time , sugar . We got your name in the social security number from your wallet . But there a couple of other questions that need answering . Like and address ? I don 't have one . I move around a lot . So when I was asleep , You were out cold , passed out . When I was passed out , did ... we ... do anything to me ? Probably . Just blood type and cross-match . What 's that ? Routine , it 's the first thing we do . Take a little blood and run it through the lab . But I don 't want that . It 's already done . Can 't undo what 's already done ! Open your mouth ! Listen honey , can we make a deal ? You don 't give a hard time and I won 't awaken you at two AM with a sleeping pill . How about it ? I won 't be here at two AM . Just give me my clothes and I won 't cause you anymore trouble . Sugar ! You 're too sick to walk then steps with or without clothes . So why don 't we settle back and wait for the doctor like a good kid ? We 'll get the paperwork later . I can do this myself ! Will you get out of here ? How did you do that ? What ? I guess my eyes are going to ... My name 's Ralph . I 'm Paul . About time they sent me a little company . What are you here for ? I passed out . That ain 't nothing . You 'll be out of here in a day or two . Any relatives ? I have a son . His name is Scott . I had a son , they told me he died for his country . I weren 't there so I wouldn 't know . Where ? Korea . It was a long time ago . Listen , when your son gets here , I 'm gonna give you the money , and I want you to send him to a deli , and have him get a pastrami on rye , I just poked around in that kitchen and you would not believe what they got for supper , The only thing that is recognizable is the Jell-O . Do you like cigars ? I don 't smoke . Smart fellow ! No , I shouldn 't inhale , but ... as long as it 's there ! You know ? My wife loved the smell of a cigar . I used to tell her that 's why I married her but I don 't think she believed me . She said a cigar reminded her of her Dad . You know , Havanas in those days That 's gone ! She 's gone too ! Why do you smoke if it makes you bark ? Bark ? You mean cough ? I like you , Paul . Bark ... that 's what it is , Bark ... Woof ! Woof ! Why are you in here ? Hell , I 'm just dying , there 's no trick to that . Everybody knows how to do it without any practice , isn 't that right , Paul ? I don 't know . You will . The big difference is how you do it . Me , I don 't plan to go out on tip-toe apologizing for my life , Go out where ? Go out where you don 't come back . Well ... if you go put before I wake up , it was nice meeting you . Friendly quitter . Polite too . They 'd better get me one of those ! Yeah ? Come in ! Hey , the Fox-man ! What 's shaking ? Got a guy walking on the water In Roanoke , Virginia Now , it sounded like something up your rather bizarre little alley , Not today , Nardo . I heard you had a run-in with the ... General Wade and his grim Reaper mode . Can 't win them all . Listen , what the heck George , you 've read Czechoslovakian grain reports before You can do it again . Maybe you 'll get lucky this time and I 'll give you something a little more colorful like , Portuguese shrimp statistics I figure you 're getting a break . The General cut you off before you had to admit that this whole thing was a wild goose chase . I 'm gonna tell you about a wild goose chase , You stay out of it ! You are out of it ! Or weren 't you listening ? You have had it ! You blew it ! You used to be a good agent , George used to be ! Messing up my jacket like that , are you out of your mind ? Why is this bed taken up by cold symptoms ? Paramedics brought him in unconscious . I was out cold . His fever 's spiking . I can read , thank you . How are you feeling now ? I have a headache . I sneeze . I shake when I 'm cold and I burn when I 'm hot . What else ? I want my clothes so I can leave . His son doesn 't know where he is . If there 's a number , give it to the nurse , she 'll contact him . Open . - Open what ? - Your mouth , say aah . Ah . I don 't have time for childish games , Mister . Forrester . This time , open your mouth and keep it open . - What are you listening to ? - Quiet . - OK . - Quiet ! OK ! Let me know when the blood work comes out from the lab . Meanwhile , start him on these ... . And put him on the RC diet . I know that one ! You 're a goner . I wish ! What 's wrong with me ? Could be a cold , could be anything , I 'm gonna keep you here overnight , run some tests . What kind of tests ? Nothing to worry about . Just some very basic tests . You don 't look like the fainting type . I 'm not . But you did . Find his cigar and kill it ! What the hell are you doing here ? - Truce ? - For what ? I thought you might be interested to see what 's in this tape . Go on , put it on . Sit down . What is this ? Another one of your gags ? Oh , George , you gotta run it back again . You 're sick , you know that ? This time keep it going and freeze it when I tell you to . Freeze it ! What does that look like , George ? Who is that ? How did you happen to tape something like this ? I 'm into sports . I owe you . I 'll remind you . It 's discrimination against seniors , that 's what it is ! And when I get a hold of Grey Hound , We 're gonna bring this hospitals to its knees . You 're losing it , Joe , gulp ! . His curtain isn 't electric , it 's just like yours , exactly like yours . What are those pills that you gave him ? He 's going to surgery , he 's gonna have his angiogram . Is that a test ? Yeah , for his heart . You 'll be feeling those pills in a few minutes . Then we 'll come and get you . Don 't do me any favors , gorgeous . Mrs Gorgeous to you , sugar . Someone called the motel ? I 'm sure they did . How are you feeling ? The truth is I 'm a little scared , about going out . There 's no reason for me to hang on here . everybody I know is crope . But old habits die hard . What was that ? He 's saying that he 's worried . Didn 't the anesthesiologist talk to you ? Yes , he talked to me . So then , what 's the problem ? Nothing , there 's no problem . You 'll be OK . OK , Paul ... What is it , Ralph ? It was nice meeting you . Save my Jell-O for me , OK ? Sure , Ralph . I 'll see you later . Let 's get this over with ! I wanna watch that football game tonight . Excuse me , you 're my last hope , I tried two other hospitals . Are you looking for someone ? Yeah , my father , Paul Forrester . Well , I 'll check for you . Is that two R 's ? Yeah . Look , I need complete lab work-up . Lab panel , your analysis , X-rays , I need to see your chemistry to see what makes you tick ... No ! No tests . The preliminary lab report has your white blood count non-existent . Now ' , I 'm sure they made a mistake , but without new samples ... Let me put it this way , there is something eating up your body 's front line troops that fight infection . No ! No tests ! What is it ? A religious issue ? You a re running a fever with no medical basis , you understand that ? I do but you don 't . There are simple routine tests , and they have to be done . I 'll be back with a consent form . Dad ! How are you feeling ? I feel wonderful . Hey ! Hey , somebody help him ! Out of the way ! I guess I need a little more rest . It 's no big deal . What is gonna take to convince you ? Don 't you understand you 're getting weaker and not stronger ? I understand I 'm getting sicker , and not better . Why won 't you sign this consent form ? Hospitals aren 't what I thought they were . Well , you 're not quite what we expected either . If you thought you could come here and die and no one to stop you Well , you picked the wrong hospital , Mr Forrester , and the wrong doctor . I didn 't pick . I 'll be back in a few minutes . Maybe you can talk some sense into him . I 'll just rest a little while and then we 'll leave . What if you rest and we can 't leave ? Look , you might as well sign this , I mean , you gotta let the doctor do something . I don 't think tests are a good idea . When is Ralph coming back ? Who ? Ralph Wollery ? That 's whose bed you 're making up . Is he a friend of yours ? I 'm sorry but he 's not coming back . So are you gonna let the doctor do the test or what ? Ralph went for a test . Maybe we should do something about it , before it turns into a big deal . It will turn into a big deal if she finds out who I am . Who cares ? Who cares if she finds out who you are or or Fox or if they catch us or anything else ? If you die ... Hey look man , if this is about these muscle-heads taking steroids , I don 't know nothing about that . Nothing ! Forrest , they must have had a pass to get back stage , right ? Where did they get it ? Your security people ? Erm , could you ... ? Cheers , man . Jimbo , you are looking at the whole pole wax . Security people ? World Productions Unlimited ? WPU ? That 's me , man . Hey , hey , check this out , man , the best chocolate chip cookies in the whole world , I could make a fortune of this recipe . You think that we can speed this along a little bit ? - I know where everything is . - Well ? Erm ... Here you go , Paul Forrester , he 's at the Breakers Motel on Broadway . Good . - Can I have this ? - Ah , ah ! Oh , hi ! Hello ? It 's the waiting that kills you , you know what I mean ? No , I don 't . What are you waiting for ? Are you kidding ? My wife 's in there having a baby ! What can I do ? I don 't know if she 's OK or what . It 's the not knowing that kills you , you know what I mean ? I thought it was the waiting . Yeah , I see what you mean . Hey ! You ! Sir ? What are you doing out of bed ? I was looking for you . I wanna talk to you . Have you finally come to your senses ? Did you know that Ralph went out ? Who ? Ralph Wollery ! Oh yes , the angiogram . The angiogram ? Yes , it 's too bad , sometimes the catheter triggers tribulation and because of the condition of the pump The heart , there was nothing anyone could do . Did it hurt him ? I don 't know , it was an angiogram , there are risks involved . as in any surgical procedure - Now , if you 'll excuse me ... - No ! I don 't wanna excuse you . It wasn 't the angiogram . .He name was Ralph Wollery . He lost a son in Korea . He met his wife in school , she died eight years ago . She liked the smells of the cigars . and she made the best peach cobbler in the world . I 'm sorry . What do you call me ? The mystery cold in room 44 ? My name is Paul Forrester and I have a son . And I 'm as frightened as Ralph was . I don 't wanna go out and leave my son alone . What are you saying ? I 'll sign the papers . I want you to make me well . Help you , Mister ? You got a man named Paul Forrester staying here ? Could be ... Who are you ? I 'm George Fox , with the Federal Security Agency . Yeah , he 's staying here , although I haven 't seen him all day long . You know , I think he 's kind of sick or something . Why do you say that ? Someone called , left a message for his kid , that he was in the hospital . Which hospital ? I can 't remember . You can 't remember ? I 'm sorry . Maybe you shouldn 't watch . Watching is interesting . But it pinches . Then just close your eyes and think about something else . Did you say that to Ralph ? I 'm sorry to say I didn 't talk to Ralph . I wish I had now . But you 're talking to me . Yes . Yes , I am . All done . You can look now . Paul ? Paul ? Paul ! Paul ! Please don 't die . Dad ? There are so many things we haven 't done . I was kind of getting used to traveling around with you . We never did take that hard water rafting trip . Besides , how am I supposed to find mum by myself ? Just it 's impossible ... I 've never seen anything like it . You must have misformatted the test program . I repeated it three times and the results were the same , look at the electrophoresis . This guy is some weirdo . Son ? Come on , son . Come on . You can 't do any good here now . Come on , go downstairs and get something to eat . Forrester . Forrester ? Forrester , can you hear me ? Who are you and what are you doing in here ? Are you this man 's doctor ? Yes , I 'm Dr. Ellen Dukow . I 'm George Fox , I 'm with the Federal Security Agency , How sick is he ? I 'll have to insist that you leave , you 're putting my patient at risk . What 's wrong with you patient ? That 's what we are trying to determine , now please ... Let me take a guess . You 've done a complete blood work-up , and everything came out cockeyed . Wait a minute , how do you know that anyway ? Doctor , you and I are gonna go some place and talk . - Now look ! I ... - Now . Doctor ? What you got lying in that bed out there is very important to me . I need to know what his chances are of staying alive . I can 't answer that because at the moment , I have no course of treatment . Because your test results make no sense . That 's right . And I really wish you stopped playing this game ! What do you want here ? And why I are you waving this National Security at me ? I 'm sorry , I know I may headed you . Doctor , I know something about your patient that you don 't know . Which is , Mister Fox ? Which is ? He ... isn 't ... a he . He 's an it . He isn 't human . What ? Inside that human form , is an alien being . I think you better go . I think you had better listen . Nothing you 've been doing has worked , has it ? Your test results , you have never seen test results like that , there are a pile of anomalies , right ? Doctor , you patient is not good to me dead , it 's not good to the world . Maybe now that you have some idea of what you 're dealing with . You 'll be able to think of something , to make it well again . Him . Not it , you keep saying it . He 's a man and a father . Dear lady , that body is nothing but a machine , in need of your expertise , treat the body , as if you were a mechanic working on a carburetor . Scott ? Yeah ? What happened ? Is he OK ? I just had a talk with a man from the Government . Fox is here ? He told me something rather ... unbelievable about your father . ever since then we 've bee just moving around . Seeing ways to beat Fox and to find my mother You can 't let Fox have him ! He 's not a threat to the country or anyone else . He came back to help me . He wouldn 't be here if it weren 't for me . He 's all I got . Scott , I have to find a way to keep him alive first , now , George Fox said treat the body , what do you know ... ? is there anything you can tell me about his body ? Is there anything that you know that might be special about that body because of who he is ? Because of who he is ? Everything about his body is special . It 's all brand-new to him . The other day he sneezed and it scared him . All new ? All new ? Does that help ? Of course that 's it ! That must be it , Scott . There is no organism attacking his immune system , he doesn 't have one ! Come on , let 's go . We have to get your blood type . What are we gonna do ? You were together when Paul caught the cold , right ? Right , so ? You were both exposed to the virus but only your father was infected . Your blood has antibodies that fought off the infection . You 've been exposed to all sorts of infections while you 've been growing up . And your body has manufactured defenses for them . He ... Your father , Scott , doesn 't have those defenses . But you can give them to him , you 're the right blood type , and your body 's already fought off the virus that 's killing him . A transfusion , very good , Dr. Dukow . I should have thought of it myself . Hello Scott ! Mr Fox , if this patient is as important to you as you say , you aren 't helping him by ... Doctor , I told you what 's lying on that bed is nothing but a complicated machine . I 'll wait in the observation room . He 's not an it . He 's my father . I know , Scott . I know . Is this gonna work ? I hope so . Are you ready ? Yeah . Hello Scott . Hi ! Doctor Ryker , I 'm sorry to bother you but I think one of your patients wandered down to the ICU by himself ? Yes , something about men from outer space . I 'd appreciate it if you sent someone down right away . How do you feel ? I don 't feel so hot anymore . I had a dream that Fox was here . He was standing over me . It wasn 't a dream . He 's in the observation room . Don 't worry about him , just concentrate on getting better . I feel much better . Good . - How 's the alien ? - He was alright up to a moment ... Get out of my way ! Get out of my way ! There 's something happening to the alien ! He one of ours alright , just relax . We 'll go back to the ward and we 'll have a nice , long chat about the alien . Crazy ? I 'm George Fox ! I 'm with the Federal Security Agency ! Right . Sure ! - Why don 't you just come with us ? - Are you crazy ? Doctor Dukow ! Doctor Dukow ! Thank you for helping me . You 're a good doctor , and not a bad mechanic , either . Are you ready ? Yeah . Thank you for taking care of my Dad . We 'd better go . Listen Paul , you can come stay at my place . You could rest up , regain your strength . There 's so much I wanna learn from you . I 'd like to but I can 't . It 's the first place that Fox would look . We 'll have to move on now . Alright , look , the staff parking lot is right behind you , down the ramp . There 's a bus station , three blocks out of here , Why do you help us ? I guess you just didn 't strike me as a threat to society . We 'd better get going . Thank you for everything . Take good care of your father , Scott . See that he gets plenty of rest . He 's a very special person . Well , in light of this new evidence , your old office is waiting , and of course ... This . Congratulations . Frankly , I wish there was more I could do . Well now , Sir , since you mentioned it , I thought that perhaps we could discuss the matter of my staff , I was thinking of starting with another 10 or 12 operatives , and then , as additional office space becomes available , George , let 's face it , you just bought yourself a little more time , that 's all . Well , Sir , in ... with all due respect , in light of this new evidence ... All the new evidence is good , just good , but it 's not conclusive . Not conclusive ? Blood test results ? Actual samples of the alien ? As I was saying ... . You got a good foundation to build your case on , now we need more . Now , fill me in on the leads . - Sir ? - What have we got ? Sir , I have reason to believe that he 's gonna take that boy on a raft trip . Don 't get me wrong now , I mean , I 'm glad you 're feeling better and everything but , I 'm all for this rest cure , it should go on for ever . Yeah , I think you 're right . I think we ought to stay here for a few days . Oh , right ! Is this the life ? - I mean , sun . - Water . - Lots of pretty girls in bathing suits . - Yeah , a good book ? Ah ? Algebra ? English Literature ? I thought these might help you out ! I figured as long as we are going to be here , we might as well put you in a school . Look , maybe staying here isn 't such a good idea after all . Besides , what about you ? I mean , What are you going to do while I 'm in school ? I didn 't know they made them this small . Oh , don 't worry . I 'll think of something . Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * *

Bits K. Gevorkyan U. Yakovlev Hi Hi what 's new ? Manohin had a pipe burst at the factory How 's the star schoolboy ? He 's out playing ... Vovka , pop out for some bread - I forgot it , can you ? And I don 't think there 's enough macaroni Comrade , that man says he 's from another planet ; we need to do something . Call 03 I will call but he 's barefoot - he 'll catch cold Hello ! Hello . Excuse my bad smell . I 'm cold . I found this in an iron bin . Fine . Friend ! Tell me the number of your planet in the tenture ? Or at least the number of your galaxy in the spiral ? I got my contacts mixed up and now I can 't return home . We don 't know the number . We forgot , my friend . And now this lad will go and call information , and we 'll wait for him in the bakers , okay ? And put this on meanwhile ... Thank you ... Listen , my friends . There 's no need for the bakers , no need for information . This is my planet ... 247 in tenture , galaxy Beta , in the spiral . With this machine you travel in space ... So which co-ordinates do I press in order to travel home ? You see time is relative - do you understand this ? Let me make a suggestion . We 'll just press this contact and travel to your home . But if this machine doesn 't work , then you travel with us to where we want to take you , okay ? No , you can 't ... You need to know ... Yes we can ... So what can you see ? Eh ? Sand ... So that gadget worked ... and that idiot , with his holes , he stayed behind ? Don 't worry ... There 's the sun , there 's sand , there 's gravity . Where are we ? We 're on Earth . Or ... Or ? No , let 's take it we 're on Earth , in some desert ... So ? Karakumi ? Eh ? What other deserts do we have ? Gobi , Sahara ... No , I said OUR deserts ! The only other one is the Kyzylkumi . No . Let 's take it that it 's the Karakumi . Eh ? So that means ... The sun 's in the west ... so , Ashabad is this way . Understood ? let 's go ! Let 's go ... let 's go ! Comrade , what 's your name ? Vladimir Nikolaevich . And I 'm Gedevan . Pleased to meet you ... You have a bottle in your bag , is it wine ? No , it 's wine vinegar . And some herbs - coriander . So we 'll live well . Vladimir Nikolaevich , do you remember what number was given by the guy who took my socks ? No . Only maybe we 're on the planet , he came from ? Listen , Skripach ! Whatever we guess , it 's all the same and won 't change a thing ! Now we choose a direction and go . The most important thing is to reach water . Alright ? Vladimir Nikoaevich , I want to put my slippers on . Well , put them on ! Then wait ! What 's the time ? Four . In the morning ? Yes ... Are you late ? I feel uncomfortable ... I phoned the airport to say I 'd be there in an hour . And here we are ... Are you studying at the conservatory ? No , it 's someone else 's . Professor Rogozina . He gave a harvest concert for us , and they forgot to put the violin in the plane . A banquet ? No , dinner ... Ah ! Are you from Tibilisi ? No , Batumi . I thought I 'd return the violin , and still have time to catch the train . I study textiles in Ivanova . Aha ... So first I went to MGIMO to return it , to the institute of international relations , but they told me there that ... Quiet ! ... A man ... Hello ... Capitalist country . Do you know any languages ? English . Some French . Tell them we have no money ... Tell them we can 't pay them . Hello ! We are from a group of tourists and we 've strayed from the group . Take us to the town , and somehow we 'll regroup ... . . Do you speak English ? Parle francais ? Hello .. Do you speak English ? Parle Francais ? ... Sprechen Sie Deutch ? Chatl ! No money . Money , documents , currency - all left with the tour guide . So , that 's the result ... we turned our backs for a minute and ... disappeared in the sands . Take it . It 's warm . Excuse me , what ? You want my hat ? I 'm sorry ... it 's somebody else 's , I can 't give it away ... There 's nothing in there . Open it . It 's not wine , it 's vinegar . Sour , eh ? Well friend so it 's agreed ? You 'll take us ? Skripach , quickly ... Like I said we must get to the nearest town , and here 's a way we can get there ! The jacket now ... A good thing they don 't want the violin . Now they feel ashamed ! Ktse ! What do you mean ' Ktse ' ? He seems to want the matches . You want the matches ? There . The whole box ? Take us away from here , and we 'll give you ' koo ' . Not one letter to identify where it 's made ... Excuse me , I don 't understand ... Do you speak Turkish ? What do they want ? They want Koo ! Tsak ! Thank you ... He wants me to wear the bell . Too bad . I 'll wear it , Vladimir Nikolaevich , if it makes him happy ... Go ahead ! All right , I 'm persuaded . I 'm going to light up , if that 's all right with you ... Quiet , quiet , quiet ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , maybe we really are on ... Yes ! Typical Martians . Lusenka , darling , pest , it seems to you these ... macaroni . So . We know Russian do we ? Why was it necessary to conceal it ? Well we didn 't conceal it . It 's very difficult to fathom a language , when straight away you 're thinking in two languages . And that Patsak is talking all the time in languages , the rest of which he doesn 't know . Why are you staring at me , maimoona verishvilo . They know Georgian too ... What did he say ? Ape son of a donkey . So . We 're from the Soviet Union , here on a cultural exchange . They know us , and where we are , and can find us . If you 're not prepared to let us contact our embassy , there will be large scale repercussions , is that clear ? We don 't understand ' embassy ' , put on the bell quickly ! That means you understand macaroni , you understand maimuni , but you don 't know what 's an embassy , idiots . I 've had enough ! You 're morons , understand ? You thought about macaroni and I just repeated it . This is not the Earth , and not Africa , my friend . It 's the planet Pluk , 215 in tenture . In the galactic spiral of Kin Dza Dza . Do you understand ? How do you do ? Let 's go ... Wear the bells , my friend ... Wear them . There we are , well done . Excuse me , where are we ? Sh ! She has very sensitive ears . Do you know the tenture of your own planet ? Tenture ? Well , tell me the number of your galaxy in the spiral . In the spiral ? In the spiral . The spiral ... Yes ... You know where the earth is . It orbits with such planets as er ... Venus , Saturn , Mars , Jupiter ... What others , Vladimir Nikolaevich ? The Great Bear . Vladimir Nikolaevich - come here . On your planet do you have more matches ? Well , you 'll find them . How many will you give us if we set you back there ? How many do you need ? Two packs like these ! Seven ! Seven . But give us what you have now , I will buy a gravitsapa from them . Sorry , but what is a gravitsapa ? Without a gravitsapa a pepelats can only fly like this , but with one you can reach any point in the universe - in five seconds . My friends , how is it that you bring a pepelats without a gravitsapa from the garage ? It 's not in working order . We had a gravitsapa . But when we arrived here , it broke down . Aha . But don 't you have a transference machine ? No . No . Give me the matches . Give us some water . Like this ! You need to do this ! Foo .. You need to do this ! Foo ... Do this ... Foo ... It 's yours , now smoke like this . Thank you . He says there they have a gravitsapa . Put your matches here . Here 's what we 'll do . When you put us on the earth , you can have them ... What do you mean ? Come on , Skripach , to the open cosmos . Wait ! Come back . Come back ! On mother earth you 'll get them . Vladimir Nikolaevich ! You said if we take you , you will give us them all . But then you stole this match from us . Patsak doesn 't cheat patsak it 's not nice , my friend ... I said - take us to the town ! And what 's this ? A shed . And what 's this ? What 's this ? What 's this here - not a town ? ! You 're trying to make fools of us . Show us your gravitsapa . It 's a trade thing . We 'll take it . Patsak ! What kind of idiots have I got here who give me contraband ktse in front of witnesses , when for that you 'll get life imprisonment lying on nails ? Have you got a brain in your head or Kyoo ? We 'll buy it ourselves . Come on . Stop ! Stop I say ! Who are you ? I asked , who are you ? The new foreman . No . You 're a patsak . And who are you ? I 'm a Georgian . No , You 're a patsak too . You 're a patsak , you 're a patsak and he 's a patsak . But I 'm chatlanian , and they are chatlanian . So you wear the tsak and sit in the pepelats , understand ? What ? Watch when I point this device at myself , my friend ... which point registers ? Green . Now at him , watch - green too . And at you ... Green . Now look at Uef - which colour ? Orange ? Because he is Chatlanian ! Well , do you understand ? So what ? Pluk is the Chatlanian planet . Therefore we , Patsaks , must wear the tsak ... Yes , and in front of we Chatlanians you must do this ... Vladimir Nikolaevich , it 's unashamed racism . Show us again , please . Like this ! If you would , a little slower ... Like this . Vladimir Nikolaevich , you have a wife at home , a son doing badly at school , a cooperative flat you haven 't paid for , and you 're here ... you 're brain has gone . It 's ended pretty badly , my friend . Very well , Skripach , let 's play their games ... There we are , well done . Now give a match to Uef , and he will buy the gravitsapa . But it was said that you need them all . I was joking . Very funny . Wait . We 'll go together ... Don 't show them your ktse , and don 't think about them . You show them my ktse . And don 't give them more than half a match . Gravitsapa costs half a match . Your Patsak said a whole match . And he was joking . Grade 300 cement ? Patsak ! Remember - Half or less . Okay . Excuse me - Chatlanian and Patsak - is it nationality ? No . Biological factor ? No . From different planets ? No . So what distinguishes you from one another ? Are you colour blind , Skripach ? Green differs from orange doesn 't it ? Tourist ! Wow ! Skyscraper ! Come on ! do as we showed you ... Hello , citizen . You won 't feel the cold in that coat , eh ? They will keep me out . They will let you in . Don 't give them ktse , bring the gravitsapa here , and I 'll look at it . Come on ... Not you ! We 're together ! Not you ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , tell him ! It 's alright . Wait here . Only don 't go anywhere ! Hi ! How 's life ? You say , bow ... but out of respect for the ladies present ... Well what 's new on Pluk ? Lay down the ktse , and you 'll get the gravitsapa . Half ? Half . Can I look at it ? Look . In general I am not a specialist on these gravitsapa , so let 's go and show it to my Chatlanian . He 'll examine it . Right . Let 's fit the Tsapa . Bad throat ? Water ... I have a proposal . I 'll give you that ktse , and you give me two bottles of water . Agreed ? Let 's do it . Do you have any food ? Kasha ... What sort ? Plastic . So if I give you a whole ktse , you 'll give me five bottles of water and a kilo of kasha . For what ? Ktse . we need to check it again . Check it ! Oi , just a second ! Wait ... Skripach ! Can you obtain more matches on Earth ? I can . If you can spit this further , I 'll give you a half chatl . Like so ... spit . If I can , you give me two matches ... . Do you see ? No . It 's just a game . I give you half a chatl , you give me three matches . Go ahead , spit , my son . Thank you , I 'd rather not . Well fine . Give me one match , or I give you three chatla , yellow trousers and these odds . Go on ! No ! Blue trousers ... Mr Uef , I will not enter such terms and conditions . Are you going to change your mind ? Why are you annoying me , maimoona verishvilo ? Mr. Uef ! I represent a civilized planet , and I demand that you follow our lexicon ! Where are they ? Who ? The one with a scar , who I like an idiot gave all the matches to . Quiet , my friends . Enough ! Enough ? What do you mean enough ? I told him a thousand times we need to go to the centre . But he 's greedy , like all Chatlanians - ' for two chatlas cheaper ! ' Well there 's still one . As I understand it , enough for a gravitsapa . Give it to me . Here . Why ? To buy a gravitsapa . Where ? There , in the centre . And how will you return us to Mother Earth , when you don 't even know in which galaxy she orbits ? The number of your planet , idiot , any planetarium in the centre will give out for two chatlas ! So you 'll give me the match ? So you can cover us in sand ? So you won 't give it ? No . And you won 't change your mind ? That won 't happen ! Then goodbye , my friend . They 're going , Vladimir Nikolaevich . They won 't go anywhere , they 'll hang themselves for a match . Either you agree to give us that match , or we won 't take you to the Earth for less than seven boxes ! Two thousand . Three Two thousand three hundred Three Two thousand five hundred , I can 't give you more . You can , my friend . Mr Bee , I have 50 rubles , matches cost 2 kopeks a box , that means I can buy two and a half thousand ... Skripach you 're lying ! You have more chatls . Mr Uef ! I am not Skripach to you ! My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich ... what 's that , an engine ? Don 't poke your nose in every hole ! ... Gedevan Alexandervich ... Gedevan , let 's tie up these lads now , and take a course to the North . Why ? Maybe the shores of the Mediterranean are there ? Ha , so Vladimir Nicolaevich , you 've gone out of your mind , my friend . Where on Pluk is there a sea ? They made fuel from them long ago . Sorry , they made what ? Fuel , Skripach , fuel ... Now you owe us six thousand , one hundred and forty boxes . How has it accumulated so much ? You ate the kasha , you drank the water ... and took the bandura . No , delete the bandura ... we don 't want the bandura . Put it down ... Let 's at least take something technical , if not who will believe it ? Now give them the violin , if you like it so much . It 's an 18th century Italian violin , and cost 1000 rubles , if not more . How will I pay for it ? Skripac , instead of thinking that you 're the first Georgian cosmonaut , give back the spoon you stole from a poor artist . I never thought of such a thing ... I wanted to return it to the institute of non-ferrous metals , something new ... Heavens ! The heavens never saw such a disreputable Patsak as you , Skripach . I am deeply sad . Where are you going ? To the toilet . You can 't go to the toilet with money , money is left here . Gedevan Aleksandervich . Ktse are very dear , my friend . Why ? Well now , on Earth , how do you determine who should squat in front of whom and how many times ? Well , you just have a feel for it . Barbarian ! Listen , I 've started to like you , and I 'm teaching you . If I have a few ktse , I have the right to wear yellow trousers . And in front of me a patsak should squat not one , But two times . If I have many ktse , I have the right to wear crimson trousers , and a patsak should squat twice in front of me , and chatlanian say koo . And the Etsilop don 't have the right to beat me at night . Never . I have a suggestion , my friend . You give us the match , now , and we 'll then give you yellow trousers , okay ? Thanks , I have some already , perhaps Skripach needs them . Skripach ! Here are some interplanetary trousers for sale . Yellow ones . Do you want them ? Skripach isn 't here , my friend . Why not ? I ejected him . But you needn 't worry , Vladimir Nikolaevich we have another ejector seat . A new one . It 's all in order . I don 't understand ... I pressed the button - he flew . We don 't need Skripach , my friend , he only uses extra fuel ... Turn around ! Not possible ... Fuel is finished . We need to fly to the fuel station . Turn around ! Or this damned match will burn now ! Gedevan ! Skripach ! Skripach ! What can have become of him ? You 've been told . The etsilops have caught him . Well let 's fly , my friend . I could murder you ! Get in touch with the epsilops by radio ! But we don 't have a radio , we threw it out . I 'll be back ... I 'll take a look ... Epsilop ! Put on the tsak , quick ... put on the tsak . Leave it ! Put it on , or he will trankluk you . You and the match . Good day . Listen , friend , We lost a young lad here , you haven 't come across him ? What ? O ! Sorry , I forgot ... They said you picked him up . I said we don 't need Skripach . I said it . Now how do we buy luts ? How ? You 're a disease , my friend ... He 's worse . He 's just kyoo . Here 's a suggestion . We find Skripach , and fly to the local government ... Bring a little sand , my friend ... We tell him who we are , where we 're from ... They 'll give us a gravitsapa , and we 'll organise some mutually beneficial trade you give us yellow trousers and we give you as many ktse as you want . To fly to the government - we need to have a gravitsapa . The governers live on another planet , my friend . Uncle Vova ! I 'm here ! Here ... Skripach ! What ! And where ... My thing , what is it ... Tsak ? Well ? I have it . So give it to me ! Why here ? Well , just give it to me , I said ! There 's noone here . That 's mine . Alright , then keep it ready . You asleep ? No . Don 't lose heart , Skripach . If there is a gravitsapa on this Plyuk , we 'll get it . We 've got scarcer things ... Listen ! Eh ! Wait ! Listen , drop us off in the centre . Patsak ! Stop . What ? Don 't come any closer . Why do you want ? Take us to the centre ! ... Three chatlas .. No money ! But we 'll work for it ! And what can you do ? Me ? I can do everything ! And what exactly ? Vladimir Nikolaevich is a builder foreman , he can build you a house And what can you do ? Me ? He can play the violin ! Play ... Play . I can 't ! See you around , Patsaks . Woman ! Wait ! I can play ! Play ! Here ? There ! Wait a minute ... I can tune this up ... Play . And sing . Wait , wait ! How does it go ... Mama , mama , what should I do ? ... Cool ! What ? I said , ' Cool ! ' These people like it . What ? These people like it ! Let me be a drummer . How ? Foreman ! We don 't need Skripach ! Don 't worry , he can be useful . Give us some water to drink , eh ? I said , after the performance . And we could take it by force . Then you 'd have to ask us . Oo ! Touch me - etselop will come and pull off your legs . I don 't give a damn about your etsilop ! Calm down , Skripach . Don 't provoke the lady ... Foreman ! Look ... .. Alright , I understand . Listen , do you know anyone with a gravitsapa and a pepelats ? Why ? Well he could drop us off on Earth , and we 'd give you a big box of ktse , and him ... I understand that your people don 't trust words , well read what I 'm thinking that your wife is phoning the morgues . No , what exactly now I 'm thinking . What you 're going to give us . Then it 's the truth . What idiot on Plyuk thinks the truth ? Absurd ! So because you say what you don 't think and think what you don 't think , so you live in cages . All this bitter cataclysm which I see here , and Vladimir Nikolaevich sees too ... Patsaks have to perform in a cage , so we need a cage . Why show off ? Doesn 't matter , my dear , we will sing beside the cage . Get in the cage or he will see us , and will trankluk you . We 're not animals . What ? No you will come inside ! Come inside ! Let go ! You will get in ! Wait ! Get in ! Get in , or he will melt us ! Okay , get in Skripach . If she wants it that badly . Get in . One two three ... Dance ! Dance ... You know , try to find another ensemble ... my friend . What ? I 'll be back . We 've got to get out of here . Boys , push the cart , it 's uphill . The pleasure is ours ... Gas ! See you , bastards ! I will tell everybody where this buffoon PZh has led the planet . Patsaks have walked all over chatlanians ! Well , everything there ? She stole the eau de cologne . Women ! ... Hang on , is that lead you got there ? Let me , uncle Vova . I don 't even know which way to look . Where 's the Earth ? Galina Borisovna ! Comrade Mashkov and I , as patsaks , could receive two chatlas for a performance - it 's the maximum . Water , luts and fines for epsilops - a minimum of one chatl a day . And a gravitsapa costs half a ktse ! That 's two thousand two hundred chatls . Divided by 365 , take off Saturday and Sunday we get six . And that 's for those six years when I had no way of returning ! That 's all very well , Gedevan Alexandrovich , but these are just words . Where is the proof , that you arrived from the cosmos , and didn 't sell the violin , as Professor Rogozin alleges , and spent all this time in a disoteque in Garak ? Here 's some rock . Here 's a chatl . Here 's a tsak . And a nut and sand I attached to the explanation report and handed in to Dean Raechke , so that it could be sent to UNESCO . Where ? UNESCO . You are a grown man , Gedevan Alexandrovich . You study for one term and disappear for a year ! And explain yourself ... With some pebble , some piece of old Caucas ceramics , and a donkey bell ! A candidate for ... well , as to that , if you have musical talent , then why didn 't you participate in our amateur performers course ? You will excuse me , Skripach , but it 's elementary koo !

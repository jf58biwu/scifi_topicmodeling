 ( SINGING ) Brazil Where hearts were entertained in June We stood beneath an amber moon That softly murmured someday soon Someday We 'd kiss Someday ( SINGING ) Central Services We do the work , you do the pleasure I want to talk to you about ducts . Do your ducts seem old-fashioned ? Out-of-date ? Central Services new duct designs are now available in hundreds of different colors to suit your individual taste . Hurry now , while stocks last , to your nearest Central Services showroom . Designer colors to suit your demanding taste . ... the Ministry of Information , Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann . Good evening , David . What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ? Bad sportsmanship . A ruthless minority seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues . They can 't stand seeing the other fellow win . If they played the game , they 'd enjoy life more . There are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large . In a free society , information 's the name of the game . But the cost , Deputy Minister . 7 % of the GNP . I understand the taxpayers ' concern . People want value for money . That 's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges . It 's absolutely fair that those found guilty pay for their detention and the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation . Is the government winning the battle against terrorists ? Yes . We 're fielding all their strokes , running all of them out . We 're consistently knocking them for six . I 'd say they 're nearly out of the game . The bombing campaign is in its 13th year . Beginner 's luck . Thank you , Deputy Minister . Thank you , David . And a very merry Christmas to you all . " Scrooge was better than his word . " He did it all , and more . " And to Tiny Tim , who did not die , " he became a second father . " He became as good a friend in the good old world . " And so , as Tiny Tim observed , " ' God bless us , every one . " ' You 're giving me the runaround . Hey , don 't throw that . That 's only for long distance . Sorry , boys . We haven 't got any vacancies . Got no vacancies . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! ( BELLS JINGLE ) Who 's there ? Who is that ? No ! ( DISTORTED SYNTHESIZED VOICES SHOUTING ) ( GIRL SOBBING ) Under powers entrusted to me under section 476 , Mr. Buttle , Archibald , of Shangri-la Towers , has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with enquiries , and that he 's liable to certain financial obligations as specified by Council . Sign here , please . Let go of him ! Where are you taking him ? There . Thank you . Same again , please . There . Press harder this time . Good . What is this all about ? That 's your receipt for your husband . Here 's my receipt for your receipt . Are you okay ? We 're Department of Works . Department of Works up here . Careful with those bloody things . Get the hell out of here ! Don 't you worry , love . There 's nothing to worry about . It 's Tuttle downstairs who can worry . His name 's Buttle . There must be some mistake . Mistake ? We don 't make mistakes . They 've gone back to metric without telling us . Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? ( GUNSHOTS ) " Buttle . " " Buttle , Archibald . " Damn ! Oh , shit ! Mr ... Mr. Lowry , would you step in here , please ? ( SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV ) Uh ... I say , has anybody seen Lowry ? Has anybody seen Sam Lowry ? Sam . ( TELEPHONE BUZZES ) ( BUZZ BUZZ ) Hello . What ? Mr. Kurtzmann . God , you 're up late . Is it ? The electrics here are up the spout . Oh , yours , too ? Well , I 'll be there as soon as I can . What 's this gun for ? This one , sister , is a 9mm submachine gun used for close-quarter combat fighting . Sam ! Jack . Long time no see . Hey ! What are you doing here ? What 's the problem ? Problem ? No problem . Everything 's fine . Wonderful . Marvelous . Alison 's in great shape . I 'm on security level five now . It 's a great year . You sound worried . Worried , me ? It 's you I 'm worried about . Whatever happened to you ? Records ? Sam ? It 's great to see you . I 'm going to be late . Sam , your life is going wrong . Records is a dead-end department . It 's impossible to get noticed . I know . Wonderful . See you , Jack . Give my regards to Alison and the twins . Triplets . Triplets ? God ... How time flies . Very clear delineation of picture . Highly mobile . Next . I want to report a wrongful arrest . You want the Information Adjustment Department . I 've been there . You have a form I need to fill out . Got an arrest receipt ? Yeah . Is it stamped ? Stamped ? There 's no stamp here . You can 't have the form until this is stamped . Where is that ? Information Adjustments . ( CLEARING THROAT ) It keeps picking up old films . Perhaps the machine 's on the blink . There 's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers . Tuttle should 've had £ 31 debited , not Buttle ! A mistake ! At least it 's not ours . Isn 't it ? Whose then ? Information Retrieval . Expediting has put in for electrical procedures for Buttle , Archibald , shoe repair operative . Security has invoiced for Tuttle , Archibald , heating engineer . What a relief ! Well , finish your tea , son . What ? Oh , thanks . I don 't know what I 'd do if you ever got promoted . No worry there . But if they did promote you ? I 'd turn it down . Would you , really ? Really . You 've been promoted . It 's your mother , isn 't it ? Pulling strings again . It 's time for you to accept responsibility . Your father would be appalled at your lack of promotion . I wish you 'd stop interfering . I don 't want promotion . I 'm happy where I am . No , you 're not . Jack Lint 's a lesson to you . He doesn 't have your brains , but he 's got the ambition . You 've got me and the deputy minister . Now please , Mrs. Lowry , don 't get upset . Please wait in reception . You 're giving her wrinkles . Just try and relax . I 'll make you 20 years younger . Dr. Jaffe , you 're a genius . Would you like to be surgeon general ? I know simply everybody . They won 't know you when I 've finished . First , we remove the excess derma , so . Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes and forehead . Zip . Now , I lift the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wig , into the hairline . Now the template . Easy . A bit of sticky . And already she 's twice as beautiful as she was before . Voilà ! Mmm-hmm . My God , it works . Madame Lowry . You look exquisite today . Merry Christmas . Hello , Spiro . Merry Christmas . You remember my son Samuel . Of course . We 're joining Mrs. Terrain . Yes . She 's waiting . I thought we 'd talk . We will . Oh , God ! She 's with what 's-her-name . Alma , how are you ? You look wonderful ! Hello , Shirley . Thank you , Spiro . Salt ? Not yet . Sam , Happy Christmas . So sorry we 're late . Thanks . What are you going to have ? I can 't decide between number one or number two . What do you recommend ? Between you and me , number two . Thank you , Spiro . Shirley , what will you have ? Between you and me , number one . Madame Lowry ? Oh , to hell with the diet . I 'll have a number eight . A most perceptive choice , Madame . Monsieur ? Steak , please . Rare . Monsieur , quel numéro ? I don 't know which number . That one there . That 's fine . Mother ... Alma , you wicked girl . You started your treatment . Number ? You noticed . Say the number ! I 'll tell you about it . Number three . Mother , listen ! Numéro huit ! Braised veal in wine sauce . Hmm ! Hmm ! It 's too exciting . I 've left Dr. Jaffe for Dr. Chapman . Numéro deux , duck à I 'orange . Chapman ? Excusez-moi . The acid man ? Really , Ida ! Just because his techniques are revolutionary . I don 't call Dr. Jaffe " the knife man . " Numéro un , crevettes à la mayonnaise . I 'm sorry , Alma . It 's all right . Steak . Numéro trois ! Mesdames , monsieur , bon appétit ! Merci . Merci . Salt . What were we saying ? This isn 't rare . I saw the most wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemist 's . Gift tokens , medical gift tokens . That sounds marvelous ! It 's good at any doctor 's and most major hospitals . It 's also accepted for gynecological examinations , including cesarean sections . I don 't know what to say . It never happens here . I 'll do something about it . Really , Sam ! Can 't you do something about these terrorists ? It 's my lunch hour . Besides , it 's not my department . That was one of the little things I 've been dying to tell you . Look . Sam 's been promoted to Information Retrieval . That 's wonderful ! Congratulations , Sam . Stop it ! I 'm not going to Information Retrieval ! Don 't stick your oar in , Mother . Pepper ? I 've got to go . You haven 't had dessert . I don 't want dessert , a promotion or anything ! Of course you do . You must have hopes , wishes , dreams ! No , nothing . Not even dreams . Sam ! Ah , ah ! ( ALARM RINGS ) ( CRASH ) Oh , my God ! ( COUGHING ) Hello ? Central Services ?

WOMAN ON TELEPHONE : Central Services cannot take service calls between 2300 and 0900 . This has not been a recording . It 's an emergency ! I 've got to have a heating engineer . Thank you for calling Central Services ... Shit ! ( TELEPHONE BUZZES ) ( BUZZ BUZZ ) Hello . ( BUZZ BUZZ ) ( BUZZ ) Hello . Hello , Mr. Lowry ? Yes , who is this ? Put the phone down , and raise your hands . What ? Who is this ? Nice and easy , now . Nice and easy . Keep your hands where I can see them . What are you doing ? Harry Tuttle , heating engineer , at your service . Tuttle ? Are you from Central Services ? ( SCOFFING ) I called Central Services . They 're a little overworked these days . I intercepted your call . You did what ? Just a minute . What was that business with the gun ? Just a precaution , sir . Just a precaution . I 've had traps set for me before now . Central Services would love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle . Are you telling me this is illegal ? Officially , only Central Services can touch this stuff . Hold this , please . But nowadays they can 't get decent staff . So they turn a blind eye , as long as I 'm careful . If they could prove I worked on their equipment , that would be different . Wouldn 't it be simpler ... Hold this , please . Wouldn 't it be simpler to work with Central Services ? Couldn 't stand the paperwork . It 's getting warm . Couldn 't stand what ? The paperwork . Your whole system could be burning , and I couldn 't do anything without filling out a 27B-6 . Bloody paperwork . One has to expect a certain amount . Why ? I came into this game for the action . Travel light , get in , get out , a man alone ... Now you can 't move without a form . Found it . There 's your problem . Can you fix it ? No , but I can bypass it with one of these . That 's fine by me . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Are you expecting anyone ? No . No ! Wait , wait ! ( DING DONG ) Shh ! ( DING DONG ) The flashlight . Central Services . You rang , sir ? Trouble with your air-conditioning ? Air-conditioning , sir ? No , it 's all right . It 's ... It 's fixed . Fixed ? Fixed ? Yes , I mean ... It fixed itself . Fixed itself ? Yes .

Now look what you 've done ! Well ... Have you got a 27B-6 ? Not as such ! But we 'll get one . It 's all right , it 's all right . Sorry , I 'm a stickler for paperwork . Where would we be if we didn 't follow procedures ? We 'll be back . We 'll be back ! Thanks for coming . We 'll be back , you bastard ! Righty-O ! Thanks , Lowry . You 're a good man in a tight corner . Listen , Tuttle ... I just happen to work at the Ministry of Information . What ? Well , I just happen to know that Information Retrieval are looking for an Archibald Tuttle , heating engineer . You ... You wouldn 't by any chance ... Would you ? My good friends call me Harry . Information Retrieval , huh ? The big boys . What do they want you for ? ( HUMMING BRAZIL ) Time to go . Sorry . ( HUMMING BRAZIL ) You must let me give you something . How much will it be for the work ? Oh , come on . You did me a favor . Just check the corridor . Well , thanks . Listen , kid , we 're all in it together . Go on . Right . Okay . All clear . I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious . What 's playing today ? Casablanca . KURTZMANN OVER PA : Mr. Lowry , step in here , please . Lowry ! Damn it , Lowry ! Psst . We 're in terrible trouble . Shh ! Look at this . It 's a check . It 's the refund for Tuttle . Tuttle ! I mean Buttle . It 's been confusion from the start . He 's been overcharged for information retrieval procedures , and someone 's trying to blame us . Can I see ? I 've never seen a refund . I 'll bet it 's Jeffries . Yes , he believes people should pay more for their interrogation . We must get rid of it . Send it to somebody else . Send it to Buttle . It 's his check . I 've tried that . Look at this . The census has him down as dormanted . The computer 's got him down as deleted . Hang on . Information Retrieval has him inoperative . Security has him as excised . Administration says he 's completed . He 's dead . Dead ? Well , that 's awful . We 'll never get rid of the thing now . What will we do , Sam ? Could try next of kin . Next of kin ... What 's the check number ? 074328K . Write into memory . Central Banking . Veronica Buttle , Mrs. Deposit . ( HUMMING BRAZIL ) Thank God for that . Would you like some tea ? ( BANG DING ) There 's a problem . She doesn 't have a bank account . That 's it , then . I might as well hang myself now . This couldn 't have happened before this seventh tier reorganization . That 's Simmons 's doing . He and Jeffries sit together at lunch . Bastards ! We could lose it behind a filing cabinet . Look , there is one solution . Drive out to Mrs. Buttle , let her endorse the check , and let her cash it . That 's brilliant , Sam . I 'll do it for you . Authorize the check . Sign there , there and there . I think I 've broken a bone . My wrist is all limp . What a pathetic creature I am . I 'll do it for you . Right . I 'll be on my way . Sam ? You are good to me .

Actually , my coming here is rather unorthodox , as payments are normally made through central computer , but as there were certain difficulties , we thought that rather than cause delay , we 'd let you have it now , it being Christmas and all . My husband 's dead , isn 't he ? I assure you , Mrs. Buttle , the ministry is very scrupulous about eradicating any error , but if you have any complaints , I 'd be happy to send you the appropriate forms . What have you done with his body ? Gosh . I don 't know anything about that . I 'm just delivering the check . So if you wouldn 't mind signing these two receipts , I 'd be only too happy to leave you in peace . He hadn 't done anything . He was good ! What have you done with his body ?

( HORN HONKS ) Go faster . Faster ! We 'll lose the house ! Don 't touch anything ! Don 't touch it ! We did it ! We did it ! Oh , no . And what would you like for Christmas ? My own credit card . Why are we here ? Go away ! Let 's go back to my flat . You don 't trust me ? You hijack my truck , lose me my job ... Of course I trust you . I was only helping . I don 't trust you . What 's in that parcel ? You saved it . Must be special . I saved you . You 're not special . I 'm opening it . Don 't touch that ! Sam ! It 's me ! And Shirley ! Mrs. Terrain . That should hold it ! Sam . Hello , Shirley . Oh , my God . Whatever 's happened to you now ? My complication had a complication . But Dr. Chapman says I 'll soon be bounding about like a young gazelle . Buying a Christmas present for your mother ? What ? Oh , yes , a little something . Shirley and I come here regularly . We love romantic lingerie . Really ? Oh . Sam , picture me in these . Oh , my God . Sam , where are you going ? Sam ! Jill ! Are you all right ? You don 't deserve to be . What a bloody stupid thing ! How could you ? Look at these people . It was a bomb ! I should 've opened it . It was right next to me . There 's your bomb , asshole ! A bribe . For official monkeys like you . Oh , God . Make yourself useful . Here . ( DISTORTED VOICES ) ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) Don 't touch her ! She 's hurt ! Damn it ! Don 't touch her ! Don 't ! Stop ! Sam , no ! Sam , behind you ! These helmets make your scalp itch . Don 't mention it . And they make you sweat . I can 't see where I 'm going . Well , I 'm lucky . I got thick eyebrows . That channels it out to the ears . Jill ! Who 's he ? Somebody from Information Retrieval . They frequent Lingerie . Where is she ? Jill , is that you ? Excuse me , sir . That is government property . Jill . Jill . Answer me . I 'm looking for a girl , blonde hair , medium height , green eyes . They check all that at the depot . We can 't allow that . It 's more than our job 's worth . Jill , you must be here . You can complete an application if you 're a relative . Now , stop , sir . Jill ! Jill . Oh , dear , oh , dear . No ! Sorry about that , sir . Regulations . I don 't care how you behaved at Records . Information Retrieval is an executive branch . We 're proud of our reputation . We protect it . Damn it , Lowry ! Those personnel carriers are still unaccounted for . And what 's this mess ? An empty desk is an efficient desk . Queries from Security . Searches from Central Banking . Clarification notices from Accounting concerning unreturned receipts . I have to ... Shut up ! I don 't know what 's going on , but don 't think you 'll intimidate us with friends and relatives in high places . Now , shape up ! Mr. Warrenn , what about this ? Lime , I have to use your computer . Sorry . Bit busy at the moment . You seem busy , too . Shit ! Of course you can check to see if she 's been arrested . I 'm afraid this case has become much more complicated since last we talked . But she 's innocent . Tell the wives of the security men she blew up today . She 's not alone . Tuttle 's just wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged Central Services . It looks like your block . You should keep your eyes open . Bye . You don 't think Tuttle and Jill are in league ? I do . That 's the beauty of it . We trace the connections and reveal them . This Buttle-Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside . Bye-bye . Oh , but , Jack ! She 's innocent , Jack . Sam , we 've always been close , haven 't we ? Yes , Jack . Well , until this all blows over , just stay away from me . But ... Oh , my God ! It 's you . You . It 's you . What 's happening ? Your thermostat 's gone , and then some . And then some ! ( BUZZ BUZZ ) What ? But , as you don 't live here anymore ... What ? Absolutely . Do you know what this is ? It 's an H2206 , authorizing compulsory , temporary requisition of this flat for our necessary repairs . Repairs ! What ? Don 't forget your receipt ! Sorry , I 'm a stickler for paperwork . I 'm a stickler for paperwork ! Bastards ! Tuttle . What are you doing ? God . It 's getting cold in here . Look at your trousers . Oh , God . It smells badly . We 're filling up with shit . Oh , God ! Oh , Jesus . Oh . Oh , shit ! We 're all in it together , kid . Jill ! Jill . Oh , God . Are you all right ? What happened to you after ... Your face . Were you hurt ? No . I 'm fine . It 's ... Well ... I 've been worried sick about you . Ahem . Who was that ? He 's a friend . ( SIREN ) We 'd better get out of here quick . Come on . Fast . Here . Quick ! Are you sure this is all right ? Yes . Yes , certain . My mother 's away for Christmas . She 's spending it at the plastic surgeon 's . The wraps come off tomorrow . Lock the door after me . Don 't answer the phone . I won 't be long . Where you going ? I can save you . Trust me . You can 't go without me . ( DOOR SLAMS ) Could you put me through to Mr. Helpmann 's office ? You have to go through the proper channels . And you can 't tell me what they are , because that 's classified information . I 'm glad to see the ministry 's recruiting the brightest and best , sir . Thank you , Dawson . ( SINGING ) The first Noel The angels did say Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay In fields where they lay keeping their ... No . No . No , Arthur .

But she 's dead . There 's a record . She ... No ! No ! Oh , my God ! Jill , no ! ( SHUDDERING ) ( GASPING ) Don 't fight it , son . Confess . Quickly ! If you hold out too long , you 'll jeopardize your credit rating . Jack ? Jack ! Jack ! Jack ! Shut up ! Jack . Jack , I 'm innocent . Please , help me . Bastard ! Jack . This is all a mistake . Take that mask off . You stupid bastard ! Jack . How could you do this to me ? I 'm frightened . How do you think I feel ? You shit . Shut up ! This is a professional relationship . Jack . Jack , no . You can 't . No , Jack . Please . Jack , no ! Don 't . Please , Jack . No ! Sam . Sam ! You okay ? Tuttle ! Call me Harry . Let 's go ! Harry ! Mr. Lowry . So pleased you could make it . Right this way . It 's a sad loss . Your mother was there at the end . Mrs. Terrain has just received that most wonderful of gifts . She came to us physically new . She goes hence , from us , not so physically new . But the spirit never grows old . Mother ? Oh , Sam . Mother ? Mother ? Stop calling me that ! Mother ! Mother , please ! Is this guy bothering you ? Mother ! Go away . This is a very sacred moment . ( GIGGLING ) ( EXPLOSION ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( LUSH ORCHESTRAL RENDITION OF BRAZIL PLAYS ) ( ORCHESTRA STOPS ) He 's got away from us , Jack . I 'm afraid you 're right , Mr. Helpmann . He 's gone .

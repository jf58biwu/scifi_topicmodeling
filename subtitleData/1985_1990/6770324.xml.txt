 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . MALE VOICE : Helton-McCleavy Laboratories of Scottsdale , Arizona ... has been awarded a patent ... for a genetically engineered microbe to be used in oil spill cleanups . The microbe , it seems , has a voracious appetite for crude oil . Despite the two-year ban on Freon use , the ozone layer continues to deteriorate ... accelerating the present greenhouse effect . In the Southland , temperatures have remained in the hundreds all week . And doctors continue to remind humans ... to wear sun block and hats when outside during the day . The DEA Chief , Wallace Aaronberg , announced today that Los Angeles ... has surpassed Seattle as the jonafryn capital of the United States . Highly addictive to both Newcomers and humans ... jonafryn , known on the street as " jack , " has been dubbed the crack of the ' 90s . The suspect 's just entered the building . We got the front covered . Roger that . Okay . Finally . So , you don 't think that there 's any reason for concern ? What ? About what ? That IRS , my tax audit . I told you , they just pull names out of a computer . Here 's the boogeyman . Hey , Richie . It 's good to see you , man . You 're a bro , a real bro . I 'm meticulous about my tax returns . If there was some kind of honest mistake ... that IRS , they would understand , wouldn 't they ? Yeah , they 're very understanding . Focus , George . I got one ounce of pure jack . $ 300 . Listen , I 'm a little short , but you know me . I 'm good for it . You know I 'm good for it . $ 180 . Let me have the jack , man . Don 't waste my time . Wait ! Listen , man , listen ! Hey ! I got it right here . ( GLASS BREAKING ) Police ! Freeze ! I said freeze ! You bit me , man ! You can 't do that ! It 's okay . I didn 't swallow . Pull that out of there . How ? I 'm cuffed . Pretend it 's an apple . Where is it ? Did you see where I put my W-2 ? It must be in with my house payments . That guy had a little kid in the house ... and he 's selling jack . He ought to be strung up . The man can 't help himself . Jack , jonafryn . You know how addictive it is , Matt . You 've got your tax stuff in my food . There it is . What I wouldn 't give for a couple of ice cubes . ( LAUGHING ) Ice cubes . How are you doing , Matt ? Hey , Vahan , meet my new partner , George Francisco . Yes , how 're you doing ? We need the check , Vahan . Check , what are you talking about ? Your money is no good here . Well , at least let me pay for the water . You insult me . Don 't do that , Matthew . Nice to meet you . Vahan 's a great guy . He never lets cops pay . Are you sure this is right ? What ? Taking a free meal . Well , it 's not really free , George . He 's kind of paying for a service . With all these cops around , nobody 's gonna stick him up . Matt , I distinctly recall from the Academy ... that as police officers , we are public servants ... and , thus , enjoined from accepting gratuities from private citizens . George , don 't go Internal Affairs on me . This is just ham and eggs and frog tartar . Nevertheless , I think we should pay . You heard the man . You 're gonna insult him . I 'm sure he 'll understand . You know , George , you can really ruin a meal for a guy . No , no , I 'm telling you , the Bureau of Newcomer Affairs ... is gonna release this land any day . And just $ 100 now ... will assure you one of the limited half-acre parcels ... at the government-subsidized price of only $ 1,000 . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Yeah ? Now , if you don 't decide to buy ... we 'll give you a full refund . Or you can sell your option for a least $ 200 . Can you hold on for a second , please ? Thanks . Margie , I need that building signed off yesterday . Please , get an inspector down there , now . Thanks . Sir , that 's $ 100 profit guaranteed . You can 't lose . Great . Terrific . Your credit card number , please ? SAM : And the expiration date . Terrific . No , thank you . I 'm the one who called about your ad in the paper . Buck Francisco . Right . Buck , why do you want this job ? I need the money . My mom and dad are kind of tapped ... and I don 't want to ask them for allowance . I like that . Oh , jeez . Excuse me , Buck . Dave , you still there ? Listen , bud , I 'll go up $ 50,000 , but not a penny more . Right . Bye . You have any phone sales experience , Buck ? No . That 's okay . What we 're offering is so good , it sells itself . Did you ever meet a Tenctonese who didn 't long for home ? For their own planet ? We 're providing the next best thing , Buck . A place , here on Earth , they can call their own . Come here . Look at this . Our architects have planned the village as an updated replica ... of a pre-slavery Tenctonese community . Here 's the Selenite temple , the communal food pen , baco courts ... and also , a modern fifty-bed hospital . That 's great ! And what is so satisfying about this , Buck , is we 're making people happy . But we 're also earning a good living from it . Buck , if you 're willing to work hard , there 's no limit to what you can make . I 'm willing , Mr. Simian . Call me Sam . Welcome aboard , Buck . GRAZER : I don 't like to take credit away from my men ... they do a tremendous job . But , the arrest last night really represents the emphasis I 've placed ... on rooting out drug dealers in the Newcomer community . Captain , please , I don 't want to hear your Rotary Club speech . This year we 've had a 50 % rise in drug-related crimes . You wanna take credit for that , too ? It 's pretty warm , huh ? Those damn Freon restrictions . You know , we 'll probably never have air conditioners again . Here are the officers . You wanted to see us , Captain . Sikes , Francisco , this is Ms. Betsy Ross . She 's a local businesswoman ... and president of her community 's improvement association . She wanted to thank you personally for the arrests last night . We 're just doing our job . Excuse me . Officer , when we were slaves , we were controlled by Overseers . To a lot of us , that 's what the police are like now . Ets-lay-eak-spay-English-ay . English , George . Ms. Ross has been kind enough to offer us tips concerning crime ... in the Newcomer community . Thank you . And , please , don 't hesitate to call me anytime , day or night . Do you have a direct line ? SUSAN : Here 's my husband now . GEORGE : Sorry I 'm late . GEORGE : It 's difficult to get away from the station during the day . GEORGE : What have I missed ? I see a deduction here of $ 5,000 , claiming your automobile as a business expense . I had a question about that . So we called the IRS . We spoke to a man named Fogul . Walter Fogul . As a police officer , aren 't you assigned a car from the motor pool ? When I am on duty . However , when I am not on duty , I am still expected to intervene ... as a police officer whenever the need arises . Mr. Fogul said it was a legitimate deduction . Are you paid when you 're off duty ? No . Then you can 't be said to be working . I 'm disallowing this deduction . Look , Mr. Fogul works here . He said it was okay . In order to claim erroneous advice from an IRS employee ... you need photocopies of letters requesting the advice , and the advice itself . But we spoke on the phone . Then you don 't have the necessary documentation . There are a lot of irregularities here . In addition to back taxes , I 'm going to have to assess some penalties . It 's about time . Help me book this evidence . Matt ... I think you would be very proud of me . You often say I let people crawl all over me . Walk . Walk all over you . But today I put my foot down . That IRS wanted to assess me $ 2,400 in penalties . You put your foot down at the IRS ? You have such a great country . You 're free to stand up to your government ... and just say no . What did you do ? I told them I wouldn 't pay . What a feeling it is for a former slave to look authority in the eye and say ... I know my rights . Call them up . Tell them you 're sorry . Tell them you 'll pay . What ? Don 't mess with these people . Call them up . I 'm ashamed of you . Haven 't you read your Constitution ? Your Bill of Rights ? You don 't understand how ... I will not cave in to this tyranny . ... they will make your life miserable . No taxation without representation . I love that . Get the phone . Det . Francisco . What ? What are they attaching it to ? What does that mean ? Can they do that ? Goodbye . What ? That was General Accounting . That IRS is attaching my paycheck . I can 't have it . Call them up . Grovel . George ? $ 2,400 . That 's enough . No taxation without representation . All it is , is money . It 's $ 2,400 , which we don 't have . I went to First Tokyo for a loan . Turned me down flat . I have $ 140 in my piggy bank . Oh , no , sweetheart . No , we 're not gonna take your money . Do you see what they are driving us to ? Those bloodsuckers . How much of this did you drink ? A quart . Plus a pint of the half-and-half . I don 't know . God . We 've done everything that we were supposed to do . We have played by the rules ... their rules , and look ... $ 2,400 . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) It 's probably that IRS . They 've come to take our furniture away . They have come to take our first-born . They can 't take Buck ! Don 't listen to your father . He 's babbling . Francisco residence ? They are taking Buck . No they 're not ! Yes . Yes , can you sign this , please ? Yeah . Here you can put that there . Mom , it 's a darak . It looks like a Sony to me . A darak is a pure expression of thanks in our culture . That 's what this means . That 's nice . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Who 's it from ? A woman I met today . Betsy Ross . Why would she send you a darak ? Matt and I arrested a drug dealer in her neighborhood yesterday . Until now , she felt the police never cared . That 's a thoughtful gift , honey . Can I have it in my room ? Can I ? You can share it with Buck , but you 're gonna have to ask your father . It 's his darak . George ? I don 't know if we should accept this . George , it 's a darak . It 's a pure expression of thanks . You can 't judge it with the standards of this culture . It 's a tradition in our culture . Whenever you wish to thank someone in a special way ... you give them what we call a darak . We call it " payola . " Payola ? Money in exchange for favors . You 're quite wrong about Ross , Matt . She hasn 't asked for anything . Yet . I take it she didn 't send you a TV ? I don 't want a TV . I don 't like TV . I read , George . I expand my mind . I 'm up to " H " in the Encyclopedia Britannica . That 's very funny . You are so two-faced , man . You get all over my case about accepting a free meal ... but you got no problem at all with your complementary television . The first is a form of bribery ... the latter is a darak . A crock is what it is . Vahan , the check ! Matt , come on . You know your money is no good here . Give me the check , damn it ! I 'm gonna pay this , and I don 't want any argument . No , New Tencton Village will be exclusively a Newcomer community . In the village school , which will be fully accredited ... all classes , kindergarten through 12 , will be taught in English and Tenctonese . That way , our children receive a cultural identity they lose in human schools . I 'd also like to point out that New Tencton is located 1,500 miles inland . Now , that 's 1,500 miles from the nearest body of salt water . And freshwater fish are abundant in this area ... as well as many small mammals and rodents . Yes , it 's a culinary paradise for us Tenctonese ... where the smell of cooked food will never foul the air . Really ? Well , that 's great ! He 's gonna buy ! Can I have your credit card number ? Expiration date . No , thank you . Yes ! Yes , Buck ! Way to go ! Come payday , you get 20 % of that $ 100 . And Buck , there is no reason why you can 't make five , six sales an hour . Do a little arithmetic . You 're gonna make a lot of money here , Buck . You know , Matt . If I touched a nerve back there , I want to apologize . We come from different cultures ... and sometimes the nuances are difficult for me . Matt , can I borrow $ 2,000 ? ( MATT LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY ) Just like that ? " Matt , can I borrow $ 2,000 ? " You 're right about those nuances . It 's just that I have nowhere else to turn . It takes a month to get a loan from the credit union , and ... that IRS charges me interest every day . I have been to three banks so far and no luck . And now they are going to lean on my car . I 'm broke . Sell that doo-dak . GRAZER : Hey , Francisco . I took a message for you . It 's on your desk . I can 't sell the TV . We 're not allowed to sell daraks . It 's a cultural taboo . If you had some culture , you would understand . Betsy Ross . Slim . She is not slim . Duh , George . You know , Matt ... in our culture , an ample woman is considered very attractive . It shows that she can afford to eat well , that she 's successful . I wish Susan would put on a few pounds . Yes , Betsy Ross , please . This is Det . Francisco . Yes , thank you . But it wasn 't necessary . A darak is never necessary . Otherwise it wouldn 't be a darak . Look , I have some information that might be useful . Could you meet me at the Palach Club this evening ? Yes , I think so . I 'd have to check with my partner . Your partner ? He 's human . Sometimes . Wait . Wait . I came prepared . Voice-activated translator . Here , just speak right in here . Eat salt , father hummer . Hey , it works ! We 're police . Ms. Ross sent for us . We 're police . ( TENCTONESE TRANSLATION ) If you could just direct us to Ms. Ross . Thanks so much . ( TENCTONESE TRANSLATION ) How you doing ? Hi . Unruly crowd . What 's the game ? Palach . I wish you would put this thing away . Looks like professional wrestling with sticks . Palach is a legitimate sport . It 's not a cheap bag of tricks . Excuse me . I didn 't catch that . I will explain . We 're not getting anywhere here . Onboard you will find a shipment of jonafryn ... intended for sale in our community . MATT : How much ? ROSS : Two tons . GEORGE : Gentlemen ... you 're under arrest . Freeze it up ! Ask Ross if she 's got any more tips like this . Look at this . There 's millions . There 's millions . I need $ 2,000 ... and those bastards have millions ! Go ahead , George . Slip $ 2,000 in your pocket . They 'll never miss it . Sometimes , it 's difficult to know when you 're joking . Who 's joking ? CATHY : Hi , Matt , is this a bad time ? No , I 'm just going to work . What can I do for you ? Do you have a tool ? I 've got a leak . I 've got a leak under my sink . I need ... one of these . Oh , a wrench ! Sure . A wrench . I 'll take a look at it . You want something to drink ? Anything . As long as it 's got ice cubes . I 'm sorry , I 've got a Freon-free refrigerator on order . The best I can do is room-temperature tea . Well , I 'm okay . Careful , that 's a left-hand thread . Look , I 've done this 100 times . These pipes are old , and if they 're corroded ... Look ... I know what I 'm doing . Maybe you should check the yellow pages for a plumber . GEORGE : You were right . Two tons of jonafryn . How did you know ? A kid from the streets . I can 't give you his name . No , the rat tails are on special . 20 % off . You seem to have a very successful business . Well , I 've stayed in the neighborhood . People appreciate that . No , no . The fish eyes go in the deli section . I also understand that you own a car wash ... a rodent stand , and a video rental . Well , one thing leads to another . And I 've been very lucky . What is it , Detective ? Ask me anything . If I can do it , I will . I assume that you acquired these businesses with the help of a bank ? They love me . First Tokyo , Mizuhara . Ms. Ross , I wouldn 't ask you this , but I have nowhere else to turn . Could you perhaps consider cosigning a small loan with me ? You see , I owe that IRS . How much ? $ 2,400 . I 'll write you a check . No , no . What I want is a loan . Okay , we 'll call it a loan . No , I 'm sorry . I don 't think so . Look , we 'll make it ... what do they say ? Kosher ! We 'll draw up an agreement . Why go through all the inconvenience of a bank ? I don 't know . What 's the matter ? My money not good enough ? BUCK : We feel confident that we 've realized our goal to find the one spot ... on Earth that most resembles ... Do you have to do that in here ? We 're trying to watch TV . I have to pitch this for the Daughters of Selene next week . You have a mirror . I don 't . Besides , I 'm letting you have the darak this week . We feel confident that we 've realized our goal to find the one spot ... on this planet that most resembles our home planet of Tencton . Do you know I 've sold twelve this week ? I wanna hear some more . One sees the beautiful blues in the many fresh-water lakes and streams ... that surround the new Tencton village . And the night sky glows with the light of a million stars . Is there really a place like that ? You should have seen the pictures . Unbelievable ! And just $ 100 down guarantees you a half acre ... at the government-subsidized price of only $ 1,000 . Should you decide not to buy , you can sell your option for a minimum of $ 200 . That 's double your money ! Wow , what a deal . You can 't lose . That 's right . I 've got $ 100 . What ? I wanna do it . Come on , Emily . Where are you gonna get the other $ 900 ? I don 't need it . I 'll just sell the option and double my money . Emily , you 're just a kid here . Well , so what ? I 've got the money ! Why should you be the only one to get rich ? Emily ? Come on . It 's a sure thing . You said so yourself . Come on , Buck . Let me in on this . Okay . Once you bend a paperclip like that , it 's quite useless . Cut your coupons , George . On the ship , we learned never to waste . I hate waste . You know what I hate ? I hate these know-it-all muffin-heads who come from outer space ... and try and tell me how to fix a pipe ! Sikes . Francisco . In here . What ? You 'll have to pull yourself away from the food section , George . These coupons offer substantial savings . I found this one ... $ 1 .50 off pig spleen . Why worry about money , George ? Betsy Ross just laid $ 2,000 on you . A : I owe that money to that IRS ... and , B : it 's a loan . A loan , right . What 's the interest ? Five percent . Prime 's 18 . That 's not a loan , Mr. Clean , it 's a favor . When somebody does you a favor , you owe them . Hi , Bryon . We 've gotten more complaints from Slagtown . It seems , despite our recent efforts , there 's been an increase in drug activity . Some residents are claiming they 've got dealers , Newcomers now ... who are selling jack on their doorsteps . They 're afraid to leave their homes . What the hell 's going on down there ? MATT : Look at this . MATT : Betsy Ross Dry Cleaners , Betsy Ross Fashions ... Betsy Ross Video , Betsy Ross Hardware . Your girlfriend seems to own this town . She provides services the community needs . I hope , for your sake , she 's legit . Of course she 's legit . You just resent the fact that one of us could be so successful . Matt . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Where did you get this jonafryn ? This a bust ? I want a lawyer . We cut off your source . Who 's supplying you ? George , what 's that guy doing over there ? What guy ? Now , what was that name again ? Cliff ! His name 's Cliff . And where is this Cliff ? MATT : Cliff 's a spiffy dresser , just like you , George . Cliff 's going to see your girlfriend . Probably just picking up some dinner . MATT : Oh , man . GEORGE : This doesn 't prove anything . Come on , George , don 't you get it ? Ross has us clean up her competition ... then she moves in and takes over the market . I can 't believe that . The darak . The loan . She wanted you in her pocket , man . MATT : A Japanese restaurant . MATT : It figures . You guys invented sushi . MATT : Let 's give her a minute before we go in . To use a darak like that . It 's such a betrayal . Wait a minute . Isn 't that ... Alec Knightsbridge . Supplies jonafryn to grammar-school children in South Central Los Angeles . And him ? I don 't know . What 's the license ? 1PCE499 . Lee Thor . Drug arrest , 1991 ... pimping and pandering , 1993 . Assault , 1993 . Suspected of running a prostitution ring . Well , that 's the UN of local crime . Let 's join the party . Hi . City inspectors . We need to confirm that your air conditioning isn 't operative . Gentlemen , we 're all here . Welcome . To Ms. Ross and her associate , a very special welcome . Although we represent different organizations ... we have common interests ... and in important issues , we decide collectively . We 've asked you here today to discuss your recent interference in our affairs . YAMATO : Conspiring with the police has cost some of us a great deal of money . YAMATO : There are those at this table who 've advocated having you killed . YAMATO : However , wars are bad for business . There 's public outcry . The police are forced to crack down . Therefore , we 've decided to give you all the jonafryn traffic within ... half-a-mile radius of your store . You retain 15 % of the profits . We get the remaining 85 % . In light of everything ... this offer is very generous . Sorry , boys ... the territory 's too small and the split stinks . You 're turning us down ? A Slag ? Let me explain something . I am not your garden-variety Slag . Onboard the ship , we were known as the Kleezantsun . What you would call Overseers . We bought and sold what you call Slags . YAMATO : That 's history , Ms. Ross . Mr. Yamato , history repeats itself . We 've given you our bottom line . Now what do you say ? I 'll have to talk with my people . Excuse me . GEORGE : She came with a purse ! CROOK 1 : Gentlemen , I think we know what we have to do . CROOK 2 : Let 's put a contract on her . ( REMOTE BEEPING ) I called in the warrant on Ross . Do you feel up to making the bust ? Wild whores couldn 't drag me away . Horses . Wild horses . She almost had me , Matt . How could I have been so stupid ? Look , it could happen to anybody . Matt ... you don 't understand . She is an Overseer . It 's something I don 't like to think about , but ... we got off that ship all right . That means they did , too . There were 250,000 of us . But how many Overseers were there ? ( SIREN WAILING ) Sikes ! Francisco ! You 're too late , Burns , they already bagged the bodies . I came to see how you guys are . How did you know we were here ? It 's on the radio already : " Two cops pulled from the rubble ! " Hey , guys , don 't smile . No , thanks . Come on ! This is a big story . All those mob guys ... gangland conspiracy , right ? Hey , go take some pictures ! Matt . We 're already on the radio , the news . Ross probably knew we were inside . I 'm with you , George . Let 's go . Hey , guys ! Come on ! Give me something ! Anything ! Sure , here . This is 1-William-1-52 ... we 're at Ross ' place of business . The suspect is not at the premises . FEMALE VOICE : Roger , 1-William-1-52 . Negative at her residence also . Ross hasn 't been seen all day . She split , George . We lost her . BUCK : Emily 's $ 100 . This is adorable . How old is she ? Ten . Ten ! What a smart kid . She knows a good thing when she sees it . Tell you what . I 'm gonna give her the choicest lot in the village . Thanks , Sam . You bet . Why don 't you bring Emily by the office tomorrow ? I 'd like to meet this little mogul . Sure . Something else I want to discuss with you . I guess I 'm like your little sister , I know a good thing when I see it . You have got a real gift , Buck . I 'm expanding , I 'm bringing new people in , and I 'd like you to manage the office . Me ? Office manager ? You bet . Can you handle it ? Well , yeah , sure ! Great ! I gotta go sign some contracts , but you bring Emily by the office tomorrow , okay ? I 'll see you then . Nice jacket ! Hey , you guys . My two favorite detectives . The Hardy Boys . I feel sorry for you guys . So I 'm gonna throw you a bone . Betsy Ross just called . She knows we 've got a warrant . She wants to make a deal . MATT : I 've got a deal . GRAZER : Right , Sikes . That 's why you 're still Detective One . You told her we 'd deal ? Damn right I did . No prosecution . She 's a murderer , a drug dealer , the worst kind of low-life scum and ... you let her yank your chain ? We gotta bring her down ! Get off the soapbox . That Slag , pardon the expression , has enough ... information for us to nail half a dozen very big dealers . You mean the guys she didn 't blow away already ? I 'm not gonna argue with you because you have a simplistic , juvenile , moral code . These busts will be good for you , for me , for the Department ... and we 're not gonna get them without cutting that deal . Now Ross will meet with you . See how she wants to set it up . That 's all , gentleman . This place must have ate it in the big one back in ' 92 . You want some backup ? No . I 'm supposed to go alone . Matt ... I want you to know that I agreed with what you told Grazer . You 're pig-headed but you have integrity . Thanks . ( FLOORBOARD CREAKING ) ( FLOORBOARD CREAKING ) ( FLOORBOARD CREAKING ) Hello , George . Glad to see you weren 't badly hurt . Yes . You have an investment in me , don 't you ? Here 's the deal : no arrest , no indictment against me on any count . I also want the cops off my back . No harassment , no surveillance for two years . In exchange , I will give information to secure indictments against three ... major drug dealers now , plus another , every six months for the two years . You 'll be a hero ! And you 'll own the streets . Yeah ! That 's the system . You better learn it . Compromise makes this world go round . Five years ago , I 'd have killed you as soon as look at you . Now we 're in business . Continue to play your cards right , you can make some decent money , too . See you , George . I 'm placing you under arrest . You 're exceeding your authority , George . Grazer sent you to hear my terms . The Overseers will not succeed , and you will not buy me . You will make your deal from a jail cell just like the rest of the scum . You stupid Slag ! Bust me and there is no deal ! You talk tough for a man in a cage . I 'll call your bluff . Halt ! George ! It 's Cliff ! What 're you doing here ? I had a feeling you 'd ax that deal . You 're pig-headed but you got integrity . ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) I 'll draw him out . Let 's nail her ass . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) What the hell are you doing ? I am booking the suspect . You get me out of here . This was your idea hotshot , wasn 't it ? It was my decision . She 's going to jail . Any deal will be made on the DA 's terms and not hers ... If I 'm not out of here in 30 seconds , there won 't be a deal . Do you realize the collars you won 't make if this falls through ? Do you realize what we pay for these collars ? The lives you will ruin ? The Newcomer children she will hook on jack ? This is insubordination . I gave you specific instructions . Don 't book this woman ! Book her . Don 't you countermand my orders , Sergeant . Captain . What ? Look who 's here . The reporter from hell . Do you think Burns would be interested in a story about a certain police official ... who 's willing to free homicidal drug dealers just for a few showy arrests ? You wouldn 't dare . Book this woman . BUCK : You know , I 'm gonna buy a Porsche . BUCK : You think we should get Mom and Dad to invest ? Good luck . Dad told me the IRS has taken their last penny . Well , maybe we 'll get rich enough to buy the IRS . Is it for sale ? One thing Sam 's taught me : everything 's for sale . I think you 're gonna like this guy , Em . Where 's Sam ? Who ? Sam . Simian Enterprises . Beats me . Wait a second , there were ... there were desks , phones , there was a whole office here ! Well , maybe you have the wrong address . Sam wouldn 't just leave . You told me you were gonna be the office manager . Manager . Right , right . How could I be so stupid ! And he ... he didn 't even pay me ! What about my $ 100 ? You lost it ? You lost it ! I believed you , I trusted you . Do you know how long it took me to earn that money ? How could you do this to me ? BUCK : Emily ! Em ! Em . I 'm sorry . I 'll pay you back . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) No . Come on , Em , what else can I do ? What I mean is that I don 't want you to pay me back . You don 't ? No . It was my idea . No , but it 's my responsibility . No , it 's my responsibility . I wanted you to do it . I wanted to get rich , quick . It 's okay , Buck , really . But the TV stays in my room . We got a letter from that IRS . George , I know you had to tear up that check from Ross ... but is it necessary to give away the television ? It 's the principle . Besides we 're giving it to charity . It 's a deduction . EMILY : Where 's the TV ? Did he take the TV ? This is wonderful . What ? It seems they made a mistake , and we only owe $ 400 . Dad you can 't do this , it 's a darak . Just a minute , sweetie . Oh , no . In light of the aforementioned irregularities , we wish to audit ... your returns for the previous three years . And how am I supposed to watch Love Connection ? We have another TV . Not in my room we don 't . You are so mean ! Did you hear that ? Oh , hi . Hi , I was just coming over ... I 'm sorry . ... to apologize . I 'm sorry I laughed . No . I acted like a jerk . Oh , this is for you . Oh , this is for you . Thanks . Thank you . Thanks . Look , I ... I left something on the stove . Right .

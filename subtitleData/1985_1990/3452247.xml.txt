 Missnie , open your eyes now . Missnie , try using your abilities . Try using your powers , Missnie ! Professor , we will soon be arriving at the Watanabe Foundation . Please don 't be worried . Oh , so we 're here ! Oran , it looks like you couldn 't get me in the end . Currently , the weather above the airport is clear , with no wind . It will be an easy touch down . Gear down . Roger . What ? ! Emergency , emergency ! Emergency reverse ! Turn on the main jet ! What 's wrong , NR-7022 ? What 's going on ? Do you read me ? Emergency ! The ground ... The ground is swaying ! What in the world is going on ? The ground is surging up at us ! Nanmo , rewind it and show us again . Emergency ! The ground ... The ground is swaying ! What in the world is going on ? The ground is surging up at us ! It doesn 't seem like something that could have caused a plane crash . I wonder why it happened ? - Could it be something that doesn 't exist in this world ? - I wonder why it happened ? No way to tell . But the wisdom of the Big Computer judged that it 's related to our job this time , so we should find out sooner or later . Things that don 't exist in this world can 't exist . But if we find things that don 't exist , they then exist . I don 't get it ! But it 's certain that with this one , we 've now had seven plane crashes , all involving airplanes chartered by the Watanabe Foundation for transport . Now , let 's get to the cockpit . Planet Ookbarl should be coming into view soon ! Bleh , time for work . Kei ! I know ! Hey , pull me up . What are you doing ? Hurry and get up ! Who 's there ? Who are you ? Was that ... Clairvoyance ? Dirty Pair Missnie , you 're back ? Missnie , welcome ba ... What ? ! What are you ... Stay away ! No ! Stop ! Please , stop ! No ! Hey , what luck ! A disco ! There are plenty of guys ! Hey , Yuri , let 's stop in here ! What are you talking about ? Work comes first . This way , and hurry ! Whatever , geez ! It can 't be ! Yuri ! Cony Brighton ! So , who are you two ? There should have been a girl here with her . Know anything ? World Welfare Works Association ? What do you want ? You don 't even know that ? I don 't know anything about the 3WA or this girl . Please don 't disturb me . I 'm busy . Hang on ! What a jerk . Those two ? Yes , Ma 'am . Understood . You 'll be coming with me . The Chief wants to see you it seems . The Chief ? Are you the one that wanted to see us ? Welcome . I 'm the Chief of Security , Samara Gallan . I sure thought we were being taken to the police . We don 't have police on this planet . Most of this planet is covered with a hot sea of clouds , and this small plateau is the only habitable location . Most of the land belongs to AJ Development , and as such , I 'm not only in charge of the company 's safety , but public peace on the entire planet . So tell me , what exactly is the infamous Dirty Pair doing all the way out here . That 's what I called you for . Being infamous is none of your business . She was ... The victim , Cony Brighton , was our client . Do you know anything about a girl named Missnie ? We 're working to protect her . You came all the way here to find your client dead and Missnie missing . I guess you 've already failed your mission , haven 't you ? I 'm afraid our work has just started ! It 's what comes next that 's important . You can work as hard as you want , but we don 't want any trouble . Wherever the Dirty Pair goes , public order is disturbed , murder cases erupt , and cities are destroyed . Shut up ! As the person in charge of public peace on this planet , I 'd like you to leave as soon as possible . Missnie is not in this city . She 's most likely in the Southern Hemisphere , in the forest of Nolandia . What 's this ? ! About three hours ago , a small aircraft belonging to the victim was stolen . According to our investigation , the thief was that girl . Missnie ? Why do you say the destination was Nolandia ? Anybody on this planet would know . It 's the only place to which one can escape . Are you going to go after her ? Of course . See you ! In that case , use our car downstairs to go to the spaceport . I 'm surprised to hear that coming from you . Don 't worry about it . I just want you to leave as soon as possible , and not a minute later . Okay , then ! This is why I don 't like high-ranking people ! I 'm not going to thank you for the car ! Oran ... The 3WA is on the move . What are you going to do ? The scenery of the plateau and the uranium mine are tourist attractions , but there 's nothing here besides those two . So the only place people can live is on top of the plateau ? What 's down under the clouds ? High temperature and humidity with magnetic storms year-around . I wonder what made AJ Development want to develop a planet like this ? Kei , why do think that Missnie stole that airplane and ran away ? Maybe something like Cony 's murderer being after Missnie as well . That 's right . We can 't waste our time flying so slowly ! Is that it ? We 're going down . It looks like a pretty big place . Do we have any clues ? One is the radio signal that the marker beacon emits . The other clue is the lake that we saw . Once we get there , we 'll work something out ! An attack ? ! There 's no sign of hostile forces . Then what is this ? We 're falling , we 're falling ! And fast ! I know that ! Yuri ! What ? I don 't want any more problems here ! Don 't be selfish ! Turn around , GF504 ! That 's impossible ! We have to go down there even if it is impossible ! There 's an identification signal coming from in there ! Why didn 't you say so sooner ? ! You suck ! Shut up ! Why don 't you steer then ? No thanks ! I 'll leave it to you ! Nice , Kei . Don 't mention it . What a brilliant touchdown you made there ! Don 't mention it . If somebody snuck something on , why didn 't Mughi notice ? Maybe he was sleeping ? After all , explosives are the only explanation I can think of ! But it was pretty incomplete , you know ? If we had been traveling through the atmosphere at the time , we would 've been under the heavy clouds by now . And we wouldn 't have made it here ? Mughi ! If you keep messing around over there , we 'll leave you behind ! Do you think we can fix it ? That ? How do you expect me to fix it without tools or parts ? We have no choice but to live down here for a while . Yuck , I hate places like this where the insects are always after you ! Yuri ! Are you all right ? Somehow ! This place isn 't somewhere for humans to live ! That 's not the issue , Kei ! Haven 't you noticed how abnormal the wildlife around here is ? Yuri , I found it ! No doubt about it ! Missnie came here in this ! Wait a minute . Is this a VTOL-type plane ? No way . Can 't you tell by looking at it ? In that case , how did this thing land ? This had to be a vertical landing , don 't you think ? But this type can 't do that , right ? Mughi ! What 's wrong , Mughi ? ! Wait ! Look closely . What the heck ? ! What the hell ? A dream ? You too , Yuri ? A bad dream . We had the same dream . What nonsense ! Let 's sleep . Mughi , get me out of here ! Ouch ... Missnie ? No , this wasn 't done by just one person . This means the group chasing Missnie has also gotten here . Let 's get back . Yuri ! It 's nothing ... Yuri ! Hey , Mughi , get out of my ... Mughi , that 's enough ! Mughi , if you don 't stop now , I 'll shoot you ! Mughi ! Mughi ! Don 't bother with those , just run ! This is too weird . Calm down ! It 's all right ! Everything will be fine ! Calm down , Kei ! Here , hold her down there . Calm down ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Right ! Hang in there , okay ? Chief ... You 're all right now . There 's no need to worry anymore . Why are we ... You 've been sleeping for three days straight since you were rescued . Rescued ? What about Yuri ? Over there . A dream ? You too , Yuri ? A bad dream . No ! What 's wrong ? No ! No ! You 're not Yuri . What are you talking about ? Pull yourself together , Kei ! Disappear ! Please disappear ! Disappear ! You 're awake ? It was an illusion . An illusion ? An illusion ? Then , what about this ? Kei ! Yuri ? ! Are you Yuri ? Are you the real thing ? Hey , are you her ? I 'm back to square one . Or is this still an illusion ? Which is it ? ! Kei ! Or is this still an illusion ? Which is it ? ! Calm down , Kei . Calm down ! Calm down , calm down . Have you settled down now ? Seems I managed , somehow . Hey , Kei ? Do you remember what the pilot of the airplane that crashed screamed ? I wonder if the pilot was seeing an illusion as well ? I see ... Then who 's doing this ? Probably ... Missnie ? Also , take a look at this . What are those ? Geez ! Okay , did you know that molecular structures can be either right-handed or left-handed ? Oh , no ! I 'm no good at that . Well then , do you remember the analysis of Pasteur 's experiment using tartaric acid and racemic acid ? I forget . The conclusion goes like this . Inorganic substances , like crystal or anything like that , always have both left-handed and right-handed structures , making them well-balanced overall . However , organic substances ... I remember now ! In the case of organic substances , each substance always has either right or left-handed structures , but only one kind throughout the whole substance , right ? Yes , so if one molecule of a substance is right-handed , all the molecules of that substance will be right-handed . See ? However ... These are samples taken from the plants here . They have both ! Okay , so that means one side is something that is not supposed to exist in our world . Yuri ! Then the airplane that crashed must have been carrying ... This is just a feeling that I have , but this whole forest , no ... Maybe all of Nolandia is a place filled with things that aren 't supposed to exist in this world , a place for all of those things to gather together . Otherwise , I can 't think of any explanation for the existence of these abnormalities ! Why would Missnie come to a place like this ? I don 't know . How were they killed when they had ESP shields ? The shields actually might have caused them more trouble . When Missnie 's illusions failed , she was afraid of being caught , so she panicked and made the creatures of the forest do this . It makes sense . But ... What 's wrong , Mughi ? ! Yuri ! This way ! This is ... It 's not an illusion . Yuri ? Is it trying to kill itself ? Missnie ? Shall we change our plan ? When we look for her , she hides and won 't come out , right ? So let 's stop trying to find her , and play instead ! Here we go ! After all , she 's a little kid ! If we look like we 're having fun , she 'll come out on her own ! Is that how it works ? Don 't worry , don 't worry ! It 's an illusion ! Isn 't it great skiing out in space ? You know ... Yuri , get out here ! Where are you hiding ? Yuri , get out here ! Hi ! Kei , what 's wrong ? If you don 't hurry , you 'll run out of time ! I found you ! Yuri , give me the card ... What ? Out of time ? ! Kei , are you all right ? You look wonderful , Kei ! Yuri , you 're up next ! Take this ! Okay , you have ten seconds . Hurry up and come get the cancellation card ! No fair ! Don 't the rules say we have at least three minutes ? No ! Finished ! Hey , what do you think ? Isn 't it cute ? A good job , don 't you think ? That 's great , Yuri ! It 's so out of proportion it looks just like you ! How great ! What did you say ? Why don 't you make one , then ? Sure thing ! This should be a piece of cake ! All right , that looks about right . How 's this , Mughi ? Here we go ! Faster ! That 's it , faster ! This is the best ! Kei , look at these guys here ! The guys ! It 's just an illusion anyway . You can 't eat pictures of food . Why don 't you just take a look at them ? Good looking guys ! Shall we dissect them ? Dissect them ! Kei ? ! Dissect them ! Dissection , dissection ! It 's me . No , I haven 't heard of any contact yet . Right now ? ! I 'm against this ! But ... I 'm stuffed ! I don 't think I could eat another bite ! Do you think it 's all right to keep playing around like this every day ? There are many different ways to go about work . Hey , Yuri , have I put on some weight ? Where did you come from , birdie ? Up there ! It must have fallen from up there . Why don 't you take it back up ? What ? Me ? Weren 't you complaining about your extra fat ? You need to exercise ! Why do I have to ... Hurry up . Right , just a little more ! Come on ! Don 't think that we 'll always be here to save you ! Kei ! What did you do that for ? ! Look ! Over there . Missnie ! Hi there . Why are you hiding , Missnie ? Do you like those ? Why don 't you come play with us ? Come over here . We 've been waiting for you . I knew that . Why didn 't you come out earlier then ? I was afraid . I was scared , so I was watching you from far away . You 're not afraid anymore , are you ? Hey , Missnie , why did you come to a place like this ? Yul , Miros , and Hisa were all brought here . Are those your friends ? Yeah ! So Missnie came here too . But I can 't find them anywhere . The scary people came to get me and I ... I 'm so happy that you 're not scary people ! You don 't need to worry about the scary people anymore . Really ? So let 's go back together , okay ? No ! Missnie ! I don 't want to go back there ! Missnie ... No ! Who is it ? ! Are you all right ? Samara ? ! Don 't mess with us ! Why did you do that ? ! Missnie is the murderer . She 's the one that killed Cony Brighton . If we had come a little later , you would have been in danger too . You 're lying ! It 's sad but true . We 've been worried about you since we lost your signal , but we couldn 't move because we were still assembling the proof . It 's not true ! Missnie isn 't the type of girl who would do that ! We have plenty of evidence . But , but ... Why ? Why Missnie ? ! Samara , you certainly did make it in time , didn 't you ? What do you mean ? Missnie was about to open up her heart to us . That 's all . If you need help , feel free to let us know . What 's going on ? What in the world ? This is an illusion . Isn 't it , Yuri ? This is an illusion , right , Yuri ? Leaving so easily ? I 'm disappointed in you , Dirty Pair . What are you thinking about ? It may be time to quit soon . You should know what will happen once the information is leaked . Soon , other investigators will come . Once , Yullgis gave me a warning . " It 's dangerous to trust Samara too much , " he said . With you like this , I may have to think that over again . Whatever you say , I can 't follow you the way you are now . That experiment too . For me , as a woman ... Samara , once you 've gotten blood on your hands , you can 't wash it off . Don 't forget that . Stay at my place tonight . Okay ? A suspicious small airplane ? Yes , yesterday , it strayed from the normal flight path . We followed it on the radar , but a magnetic storm got in the way , so ... You two ! Okay , don 't move now ! Sorry for coming in through the window ! I thought you went home ! We don 't quit a job halfway through ! We hired a couple of people , and our pet is keeping an eye on them . We 've solved all the mysteries , Mr. Oran , president of AJ Development . The first tragedy was that , for better or worse , Dr. Kishida was a scholar through and through , wasn 't it ? Searching for an environment in which he could devote himself to his research , since he hated your control , he took the research materials he had and sold himself to the Watanabe Foundation . After you found out what had happened , you shut his mouth and destroyed the cargo at the same time . Missnie , try using your abilities . Try using your powers , Missnie ! Emergency , emergency ! Emergency reverse ! The second tragedy was that he didn 't know about Missnie , right ? Seven airplanes , including the decoy . You involved quite a few people in this thing . This seems to have nothing to do with me , unfortunately . I told you not to move ! Before I came here , I went to see AJ Development 's uranium mine . Your big lie of a uranium mine . Just approximately , it 's from about two million years ago . In other words , it 's not a human ruin , but an alien one . You were very pleased to find this unexpected treasure here and started doing research on the things you found . You not only didn 't know how to use them , but you didn 't even know the purpose of the majority . But with the group effort of your scientists , and a fortunate stroke of luck , you found out how to use a few of them . Missnie is an artificial esper born from the legacy of the alien ruins ! Do you have any proof ? Two things . One is the illusion that Missnie showed us . The other , the living things of Nolandia . They 're the failed products of your experiments until you made Missnie . I can 't even imagine how many of them are there . But no matter what their purpose is , nobody should have the right to play with and neglect the lives of so many things . You must have been thinking about controlling the universe or some nonsense like that , right ? How naive . What ? What is goodness ? It is the desire for power , and everything which boosts that power . Then what is badness ? It is everything that comes from weakness . The weak cause nothing but harm for us . What we should wish for is more power , and not peace , but war ! The weak and the failures need to be destroyed ! This is the first principle in our love of humanity , that we should undertake the weeding out ... Enough of the nonsense ! Are you saying that killing Cony was part of this weeding of yours ? That 's a very convenient principle you have . After she appealed to the 3WA , she was disposed of as a traitor ! The Dirty Pair ? It couldn 't be ! I 'm sure the Universal Federation Police have begun to look into this . Why don 't you guys give it up ? Oran ! Samara ! Oran ! Get out of my way ! Wait ! Yuri ! Leave him to me . Go and get Oran ! I 'll leave the physical battle to you , Kei . What ? This is no good ! It 's over already ? Give up ! Samara ! Wait ! Taxi ! Idiot ! Who the heck are you ? A friend of justice ! Here I come , Oran ! Damn it ! It 's me . Missnie is still alive . As we thought . They have an unbelievable amount invested in her after all . Oran has changed ever since Missnie was made ! Stop ! It 's me . Get out of my way ! I can 't do that . Just a moment ago , you were released from your job as Chief of Security . What ? Oran ! Samara ! Let 's go ! What the hell ? ! There are too many of them ! We are Chief Samara 's men to the end ! Please use this bike . Wow , thanks ! Done yet ? Quickly ! I hope the code hasn 't been changed . This way ! I 'm not letting you get away ! I didn 't know they had another research center here . Missnie ! It 's all right . She 's just sleeping . She 'll be awake in an hour or so now . An hour ? Oran secretly took a part of the alien ruin to his plane . With that , he can make as many Missnies as he wants . His destination is the spaceport ? Take care of Missnie . Got him ! Please replace the energy pack . Couldn 't you have waited a little bit longer ? Really ! Oran ! Wait ! Wait up , bus ! Wait for me ! Wait , please ! Hey , Miss , what 's wrong ? You look pretty desperate ! Shut up ! Hey , this is a nice chance ! Lucky me ! No , you can 't ! Thief ! - I told you , I 'm borrowing it ! - No , you can 't ! Thief ! I 'm not letting you get away ! It 's me . I 'm going to the spaceport now . You 're still alive ? ! I have the Devil 's luck , you know . That Devil 's luck is over now ! So quick ! It 'd be boring if it ended that easily , wouldn 't it ? A cyborg ? ! Everybody move to the next vehicle forward ! You 're in my way ! Wait ! The spaceport ? What 's wrong , Miss ? How long until the next train ? Sixteen minutes . How far is the next station ? 1.3 kilometers . Is that so ? Hold it ! I 'm not letting you get away ! What ? I 'll have to try this ! Wow , you 're a die-hard . But it 's over . Here you go . Bye-bye ! Hold it ! The chasing game ends here . Let me through ! What is Yuri doing ? Take a look behind you . Kei ! Yuri , Oran is over there . Okay ! Stop that guy ! Give me that ! Oran ! I won 't forgive you ! Stop ! What are you doing ? Let go of me ! Are you resisting ? He 's running away . Let me go ! I said , I won 't let you get away ! How 's that ? That should be the end of that ! That 's enough ! AJ-1 00 , you are cleared for takeoff . What a stubborn girl . The range of fire for this gun is forty meters . Missnie ? Yuri ! What is this ? Another illusion ? No , it 's not . Can you hear me , Mughi ? Come here . Hurry ! Since ancient times , the Ajijijohari plateau has always been destined to collapse due to erosion someday . But Missnie and the others hastened it . Was it because of us ? I 'd like to think not , but ... But what ? In the end , we weren 't able to save Missnie . But at least I can say this . Nobody will make Missnie scared anymore . And so , you can make the report to send to the Chief , Kei ! Why do I have to do it ? I don 't want to ! I don 't want to either ! Please ! No , no , no !

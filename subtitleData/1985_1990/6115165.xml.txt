 This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf . The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak , the only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are : a life form who evolved from his cat , and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew . In the three million years we have been away , it is my fond hope that mankind has abolished war , cured all disease , and gotten rid of those little western saloon doors you get in trendy clothes shops , 140,000 rehydrateable chickens . Check . 72 tons of reconstituted patty . Check . 4,691 irradiated haggis . Oh Rimmer , it 's Saturday night . I 've had enough . 4,691 irradiated haggis . Rimmer , it 's Saturday night . I want to boogie on down . 4,691 irradiated haggis . We 've been doing this for four hours . Let 's have a break . 4,691 irradiated haggis . Rimmer , will you stop saying 4,981 irradiated haggis , and speak to me ? 4,691 irradiated haggis . Rimmer , I want to go for a drink . 4,691 irradiated haggis . I want to have some fun ! This is fun , are you mad ? You read something out , I say " check " . Where 's the fun ? All right . We 'll put you in command for a few seconds , Cap-i-tain . What 's the plan sir ? Come on , Lickety-split . Go back to Earth . And in the meantime ? I dunno . Generally slob around ... have a few laughs . Excellent plan , Lister . Excellent plan . Brilliant plan . There was me thinking you hadn 't thought about it , when clearly , you have ! Right , I 'll just stand over here and laugh slobbily , shall I ? Rimmer , I 'm going for a drink . Gimme me cigarettes . I only owe you four and three quarters . You owe me five . One cigarette for each day you obey me . Well there you go , five days , five cigarettes . Ah , but I 'm penalizing you a quarter of a cigarette for saying , " check " in a variety of silly voices , while doing the homogenised puddings . Well , I 'm taking five . You take five Lister , I 'll eject the rest of the ship 's stock into space . Ha , ha , ha . So , they 're somewhere near an airlock ? Ha , ha , ha . You 'll never find them , Lister . I was always a master at " Hide and Seek " as a child . It 's not a gift you lose . OK , quark brain . Even it out . Take out the flaky bits . Oh , I really , really hate you , Rimmer . Have a lovely , lovely time , Lister . Give my regards to the air . Lights ! Holly , why Rimmer as a hologram ? Why did you have to bring Rimmer 's hologram back ? He was the most unpopular man on board this ship . I mean , he even had to organize his own surprise birthday parties . Who should I have brought back , then ? Anyone . Chen ... Petersen ... I mean , Hermann Göring would have been more of a laugh than Rimmer . I mean OK , he was a drug-crazed transvestite , but at least we could have gone dancing . Water ! I brought Rimmer back because he 's the best person to keep you sane , Oh , crap . Not you ! I do apologize , I wasn 't paying attention . See you later . What about , what about Kristine Kochanski ? You could have brought Kristine back . Your entire life , your shared conversations with her totalled 173 words . So ? In terms of wordage , you actually had a better relationship with your rubber plant . I know , but Rimmer ! He 's the person you knew best . Over 14 million words in all . Holly , seven million of those were me telling him to smeg off , and the other 7 million were him putting me on report for telling him to smeg off . Jean-Paul Sartre said hell was being locked forever in a room with your friends . Holly All his mates were French . I 've been to Titan , I 've been to Juno . I can name eight things that go in jars that you know . Pickles . Jam . Spaghetti . Brains . What , in jars ? Me uncle 's brain is in a jar . It 's really sad . Why 's it sad ? He 's not dead yet . Alright , Everybody 's punished . Finish your drinks . Could you move please , excuse me , some of us have more important things to do than wiggle our posteriors . Will you move , please ? Please ? Thank you . Would you move ? Excuse me , please . Excuse me . Excuse me , please . Excuse me . If you want to dance , do it over there . Sorry . That woman is out of your league . She 's just too classy for you . Who is ? Kochanski . I 've got no big thing about Kochanski . Stick to your usual type , Women with little wispy beards who wear three overcoats and carry little bags full of string . Christine Kochanski ? ! Sh ! Shut up ! What , officer Christine Kochanski ? ! Selby ! Have you eaten a coconut whole ? Naah ! You 've got no chance with her . You 're just too ugly . Listen , hadron head , I 've got no big thing about Christine Kochanski . I have . So have I. Lister , where 's my revision timetable ? Sir , it 's Saturday night . Come on , no one works Saturday night . You don 't work any night , you don 't work ANY day ! Skive hard , play hard , that 's our motto . Look , I 've got my engineering re-sit on Monday , I don 't know anything . Where 's my revision timetable ? Wait , is this the thing in all different colours , with all the subjects divided into study periods and rest periods , and self-testing times ? It took me seven weeks to make it , I 've got to cram my whole revision into one night ! Hang on , is this the thing with a note on it , in red , which said : " Vital , valuable , urgent . Do not touch on pain of death " ? Yes ! I threw it away . Ha-ha , tee-hee . Where is it ? Nah , I didn 't , I pinned it up on the wall . What , why ? To dry it out . What do you mean , " dry it out ? " Well , I spilt a goat vindaloo on it . Don 't worry , it 's a little bit red but you can read most of it , especially if you scrape the lumps off ! You spoilt my ... No , I haven 't got time , I 'm taking learning drugs and all I 'm memorizing is this conversation . They 're illegal . Where 's my revision timetable , Lister ? It 's Saturday night . No one works Saturday night . You don 't work any night or don 't work any day , Skive hard , play hard that 's my motto . Lister , where have you put my revision timetable ? It 's Saturday night . No one works Saturday night . You don 't work ... I 've been to Titan , I 've been to Bolanski , I can name 90 men who 've slept with Kochanski . Me ! Me ! Me ! The London Jet Juniors ! The Service Droids ! My mother . OK . Leave it alone . Leave it alone . Oh , baby ! Hey ! Jump back . Come back . Heh ! How 'm I looking ? I 'm looking nice . My hair is nice , my face is nice , my suit is nice . I 'm looking really nice . Aawh ! Jump back . Ooh-eah . Hey ! Get down . Wonder how I 'm looking now ? Still looking nice . My hair 's still nice . My face is still nice ... My suit . I 'm just nice , period . Aawh ! Jump back . Get down . Oooh , heh ! Good evening , you stupid , stinking , festering , gimboid of a cat . You 're going to put these cigarettes back , aren 't you ? Are you crazy ? This is my all-time best lucky find , that I ever found in the whole of today . No , no , no , no . You 're going to put these cigarettes back quickly before he comes . These are mine . They 're not yours , put them back . See this hand ? It is mine . See these things ? They are mine . I 'll give you a fish . One fish ? Ha ! Two fish . For all these shiny things ? I 'll show you how to get all the fish you 'll ever need . Five fish ? Mmmm . Five fish ! I 'll be rich . You certainly will , yes , come on . Hey , hey ... Five fish ? Six fish . # Oh , dance , dance ... dance # Lister , what on Titan is this din ? LISTER ! What on Titan is this din ? It 's Rasta Billy Skank . Is this it ? Its got a health warning on it , you know . It 's bad for you . It 's a classic . " Danger ! Government Health Warning : " this music can make you irritable and irrational , " and has been linked with disorders of the nervous system and bowels . " Rimmer , no one takes any notice of that stuff . Lister , if you want to dice with death , fine , but don 't poison my sound waves . Off . Why don 't you listen to something really classical , like Mozart , Mendelssohn or Motorhead ? I think I 've gone video blind . Is that painting yours ? It 's rubbish . It 's a mirror ! I need some sleep . Rimmer , do you uhh ... do you remember Kristine Kochanski ? Navigation Officer ? Yes , I remember her . Snooty cow . She used to look down on me . She used to call me " Rimmer " . Everybody called you Rimmer . It 's the way she said it though , " Rimmer " " Rimmer " , to rhyme with " scum " . God , she had a chip on her shoulder , Lister Oh yeah , well I want to go on a date with her . Tough . She 's dead . It 's just one night ... No . I want to turn you off , No . for just four hours , No . and spend an evening with her hologram . No . Look , I know you 're worried I won 't turn you back on ... No . But I promise , I swear if you tell me where you 've hidden the hologram disc ... No . You 're not even prepared to discuss it . We are discussing it , Lister . What 's this if not a discussion ? A diesel locomotive ? Rimmer , I promise , I swear I 'll turn you back on . Is that it Lister , is that the entire proposal ? Yes . Well , Lister ... No , think about it seriously . Don 't just dismiss it . All right . All right . I 'll think about it . You 're just gonna say " No " . Don 't interrupt . I 'm thinking about it . But you 're just going to say " No " . Not necessarily . I 'm mulling it over . Yeeee ... No . But what is it man ? Don 't you trust me ? Black card Lister , I 'm holding up a black card . Conversation over . I 've always been crazy about her and I never did anything about it . Ohh , Lister , you 've forgotten the color code . White , the white card is to continue the discussion . But this is a black card situation . Discussion over . Listen . # Black card , black card . # Listen . # Black card , black card . # I was talking about something else . White card . Go on . Well for a start , I want to stop all this black card and white card , smeg , it 's driving me crazy . Black card . Four hours , I just , I want to spend an evening with her hologram ! What 's so wrong with that ? You don 't know when to stop , do you Lister . I 'm your superior . Technician was the lowest rank on this ship . The man who changed the bog rolls was higher than us . Yes , well , he 's not here now , Lister , and we are . And there 's still a pecking order , and I 'm pecking you , baby . OK , Rimmer OK . OK ? Oh-kaaay . Is that a threat , Lister ? Yeah . Actually , " OK " is not a threat Lister , technically speaking . It is when you mean it to mean what I mean it to mean . And I mean it to mean : OK , Rimmer . Ohh-kaaay ! Now Lister , OK is never a threat , no matter how many " A " s you put on the end . I 'm going to pass the exams and become an officer . Oh , come on . Wise up , Lister . You 'll have to salute me Rimmer . You 'll have to call me " Sir " . You 'll have to give me Kochanski and me cigarettes . And on that day , Lister , Satan will be skating to work . Lister ! Rise and shine , El Slotho . Come on ! I 've been awake for hours Lister . Up , up , up . Come on , exercise , Lister ! Exercise , sonny boy . Quarter to two ? I didn 't set my motivator . I was supposed to be up at seven . Why didn 't he wake me ? He knows I 'm a heavy sleeper . Have I got to remind him to do everything for me ? He 's so irresponsible . Holly , give me a cold shower , will you please . Certainly , Arnold , Ooooh ! Not that cold ! Hotter ! Hotter ! Aaaargh ! Not that hot ! Just forget it . Can you give me a clean uniform ? Perhaps you can manage that ? Thank you , Holly . Where 's Lister ? Uhh , Holly , where 's my arm ? This isn 't my arm . Whose arm is this ? I 'm sorry , Arnold , your physical data disc has become corrupted , Don 't give me excuses . Give me my arm back . I 'll have to refresh the graphics from a back-up , It 's got tattoos . " Candy " ? " Denmark Forever " ? Is this Petersen 's arm , Holly ? I 've got the arm of a Danish moron . If you 'll just bear with me for a few minutes , Arnold , It 's not good enough , Holly . It 's traumatic enough being dead . And whose ears are these Holly ? They 're like two giant radar dishes stuck higgledy-piggledy to the side of my head . I mean just look at them , look at them . Whose were these ears , Holly an African elephant 's ? They 're your ears , Arnold , It must have been the way I slept . I haven 't got time for this . Where 's Lister ? That information is security protected , What 's he doing ? Hello , how can I help you ? Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal , Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal , Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal . Fish . Today 's fish is trout á la créme , Enjoy your meal , I will ! Lister , where 's Lister ? No they 're mine ! The fish is mine ! I don 't want your fish , you stupid cat . Where 's Lister ? Idiot ! Holly , As senior rank aboard this ship , I order you to tell me where he is . I 've told you , I can 't Holly , that 's an order , you stupid ugly goit . Ugly ? I 'll have you know I chose this face out of the billions available , because it happened to be the face of the greatest and most prolific lover who ever lived , Really ? Well , he must have operated in the dark a lot . You what ? And when are you going to give me my own arm back ? I refuse to walk round all day with Petersen 's arm . You know what he was like . God only knows where this arm has been . What 's he doing ? Beats me , Arnie , Seems to have a mind of its own , Tell him to stop it . What is this ? A cabaret ? Entertainment while you eat ? No ... no ... no ... Hey , can you place bets ? My bet is on this arm . Ahhh ! Holly , you 're absolutely gorgeous and handsome and delicious . Please tell him to stop it . All right , just give me a couple of seconds , Ah look at that ! I 've outwitted him . He 's given up . Look , he 's given up . Oooooh ! There , done it , Just in time , Hey ! That was good . You should 've finished on a song . It would have been perfect . I hate everything . Where is Lister , the little worm ? Lister ? Listie ... Listie ... Wistie , Lister ? I know you 're here , Lister . You 're always here , Sunday afternoons . What are you two doing here ? Skutters don 't have time off . You really must think I 'm stupid . I 'll deal with you two later . You 're serious about this Lister , aren 't you ? Go away , I 'm busy . Off . You seriously believe a piece of fungus like you has got the stuff to become an officer ? You 've the brains of diarrhea and the breeding of a maggot . I mean , what are you writing on Lister ? The inside of a chocolate wrapper ! I mean , come on , where 's your loose-leaf file ? Where 's your pencils , where 's your protractor and your hole reinforcers ? Rimmer , I 'm going to pass this exam by knowing things . OK . What 's a porous circuit ? Don 't know . How do you calculate acceleration ? Don 't know . Ohh , this is sad . What 's Boyle 's Fourth Law ? Don 't eat greasy food ? These are basic engineering precepts Lister . How do you expect to pass the engineering exam ? I don 't . I expect to pass the chef 's exam . Chef ? You want to become a chef ? Not really . I just want to become your superior . But a chef ? A white-hatted ponce ? That 's not a real officer . It outranks you , smeg-for-brains . And Lister , what 's this ? Learning drugs ? They 're illegal , matey . I 'm afraid you 're in very serious , grave , deep trouble , Lister . Where did you get them ? I want names , I want places , I want dates . Arnold Rimmer . His locker . This morning . Why am I worried ? You 'll never stick at it . You 'll never pass . Say " You 'll never pass , Mister Lister , sir . " Practise , Rimmer , it makes perfect . Question four ... underline that . What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars ? I 'm gonna die ! I 've been " fished " to death . My answer : In answering the question " What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars ? " ... Write bigger . " There are various words that need to be defined . " What is a spectrum ? What is a red one ? Why is it red ? " And why is it so frequently linked with quasars ? " What the hell is a quasar ? Just put a neat cross through it . We 'll do the next one . Okay ? .. and I think that confidently and concisely answers the question , " What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars ? " Lister , did you make that ? Yeah . It 's not that good . It was supposed to be roast beef . Do you want some , Cat ? It 's got some real cream and fudge in it . Ahhh , I think I 'm going to have to go and do something secret . Look out ! Food escape ! So , Lister , you doing all right ? Not bad . Not bad at all . Lister ... Lister all this tension between us is stupid . There 's just no need for it . I mean , you 're tense and I 'm tense , and there is just absolutely no need for it . I 'm not tense . Of course you 're tense you rectum-faced pygmy ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I mean , there 's no need for you to be slogging your guts out . I 'm enjoying it . Shut up . Doing an exam and doing so well . There 's absolutely no need for it Lister . You can have the cigarettes , they 're in Pipeline 22 . I know . Good . The Cat betrayed me . I don 't mind . I 'm delighted . What I 'm saying Lister , is there 's no need for us to be at loggerheads . I mean , we 're mates , we 're pals . When ? Oh , come on Lister . Laugh , laugh , laugh , chuckle , guffaw , giggle . That 's Rimsy and Listy . When ? Millions of times . When ? Ah ! Ah ! How about the time your safety harness snapped and you fell into the cargo bay ? We laughed then , didn 't we ? I cracked me spine in three places . Yes , but it was hilarious . We laughed like drains . You laughed . I spent six weeks in traction . Yes , that 's right , that 's right . And you spent the rest of the summer walking around like a croquet hoop . Ah , I laughed so hard I nearly puked . I really did . What are you saying to me Rimmer ? I 'm just saying , Lister , that with times as good as those , there 's no point in letting something small and silly like this come between a friendship that we 've nurtured , like a small flower , petal by petal , and watched blossom and bloom into something rare and special . OK . Give me Kochanski . Smeg off , dishwater breath . You won 't turn me back on . What , Rimsy-wimsy-mimsy , me bestest-ever pal ? All right Lister , I order you not to take those exams . Black card , Rimmer . YOU are black carding ME ? That 's only the beginning , Rimmer . When I pass the exams and become an officer , you 'll be on latrines . You 'll have the three o 'clock watch every morning and I know you 'll obey me , because you ... I mean , you ... respect all that officer smeg . If you mean I respect my superiors , no matter who they are , and I I obey orders blindly and unquestionably ... yes ! Yes , I do . That 's exactly what I mean . Anyway , I 've got to get some sleep . Hard day 's revision on the morrow . You always become the thing you hate the most . Look at you , Lister ... obnoxious , ruthless , single-minded , insensitive you 're more like me than I am . Rimmer , you 've forgotten the colour code . This is a black card situation . End of conversation . " You never learn , do you ? " Chef Part One Examination , Please proceed to the Teaching Room , You 're not ready for it . You know . Look at you , you should be doing last-second revision . I am . I 'm revising buns . I mean , it 's obscene , missing the entire first minute of the exam . OK , here we go . No . You can 't do this to me , Lister . Give me Kochanski . No . That was a lousy thing to do to a Hologram . Have you no respect for the dead ? Hello , Dave . I 'm just doing this , er ... I 'm taking , er ... This is a surprise . Dave , why didn 't you just tell me how you felt about me when I was still alive ? Because I 'm a dope and I 'm a bum , and I 'm stupid and I 'm an idiot and I 'm hopeless and I 'm useless . I 'm sorry , but I just don 't like you . Oh-ey , I 'm really embarrassed now . I don 't know what to say . I suppose it 's sort of pointless you doing the exam now . Well yeah , it 's sort of pointless me breathing in and out if you want to know the truth . I could never love anyone like you . So you might as well pack up your pots and pans and off you go . I need a man who 's going places . Up , up , up the ziggurat ... lickety-split . So , it didn 't mean anything to you , then ? What didn 't ? You know , when we ... Made love on the snooker table , behind the bins . You never told me that ! I thought you might have noticed . Oh , yes , yes . I remember now . We 've never made love . Go away , Rimmer . Look , look , I 'm a bit out of sorts at the moment . I 'm having a woman 's period . A woman 's period ? Women don 't speak like that . Give me a break . I don 't know how you 've done it , Rimmer , but that is not Kochanski . It 's Kochanski 's body , it 's Kochanski 's voice . I mean what 's the difference ? Come on ! The difference is that you 're in there , urgh ... Well , you can 't blame me for trying . Leave . I 've seen something you haven 't , squire . OK , Holly , swap discs . Ah , Holly , this is not my breast . I want my own nipple back . Leave , Rimmer . There 's no rush , Holly . Holly , are you sure these are my hips ? Lister : 16912146 . How did you do ? How did you do ? How did you do , Lister ? How did I do , Mister Lister , SIR ? # It 's cold outside . There 's no kind of atmosphere . # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

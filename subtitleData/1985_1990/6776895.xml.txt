 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * [ metallic noise ] [ metallic noise ] [ Applause ] Thank you . Thank you . Oh , what a wonderful audience ! Such enthusiasm ! [ Applause ] And now here is your guide to independent thinning , Dr. Anthony Ferrel Blake , director of the psychological research institute . In this complex world we live in , we need all the help we can get to make those right decisions . That 's why you , independent thinkers , have made this the number one show in the greater metropolitan area . [ Applause ] Becky ? Yeah ? Dr. Blake 's on . Don 't you want to come down and watch him ? No . I see him enough . Tonight I would like to address the subject of teenage alienation . Today 's young people lack confidence . Drug abuse , alcoholism , teenage suicide have all taken a horrendous toll . But there is an answer . Modern science can put a stop to this epidemic , just as it has solved many problems of the past . And we here at the Psychological Research Institute of Independent Thinking have the answer . Independent thinking . Independent thinking . * * * * * * * * [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] No ! Let me go ! No ! No ! * * * * * * * * Becky ? Are you okay ? I don 't know . What is going on ? I don 't know . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] * * [ Screaming ] Just a few short months ago , we were just another local TV show here in Meadowvale . But thanks to your support , I am pleased to announce we will be going nationwide very soon . Give yourselves a hand , you independent thinkers . [ Applause ] [ Applause ] [ car noise ] Today 's top story , three more unexplained violent deaths in the Meadowvale area over the weekend . Police have found no connection between the rash of murders and suicides which have swept our community over the last two weeks . Stay tuned for the latest details on the hour with complete local and international news . Now back to a bit of that hard , hard rocky parade teeny boppers love so much . * * * * * * Hi , Jim . Hey . Billy ? It 's Majewski . Hey , what 's up ? So , what time did you get home last night ? 12 : 30 . My old man almost killed me . Where is Janet ? She was looking for you . Hey . Hi . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . Did you do the homework ? Thanks . How are you going to copy it now ? I 'll do it during class . Jim , if you get caught , I 'll get in trouble , too . I thought you said you loved me . I love you when you 're staying out of trouble . Okay . Come on . Oh , wait . What ? I 'll see you . Where are you going ? I got to go to the bathroom . Hurry up . Save my seat . Tell me . Tell me . [ toilet flushes ] Hi , Mr. Sweeney . [ Scream ] [ water gushes ] This is one of your stunts , isn 't it ? What ? You just came out of the washroom . I think somehow you managed to tamper with the plumbing . That 's why I 'm soaking wet . That 's a pretty serious accusation , sir . You know , we 're learning in civics class right now how you 're innocent until proven guilty . So you you think you 're an American , do you ? Last time I checked . Well , you 're not ! You 're in high school . You left this behind . Now I really got you , you little punk . Let 's go . Mr. and Mrs. Majelewski , it 's true James has one of the highest IQs in our high school , however , his intellect and energy is primarily channeled in causing trouble . Doesn 't seem to be affecting my grades , does it ? No , but it 's affecting the students in our classrooms , our teachers , and myself . It 's too bad . Yeah , it is too bad . And unless we can find some other alternative , I may have no choice but to suspend James . If I do that , you won 't graduate . You can 't do that . It 's blackmail . It is not blackmail . Not in any way , shape or form . What we have to do is get to the root of the problem . I think it is your attitude that is causing your antisocial behavior . You can 't prevent me from graduating . James , you 're preventing yourself . Now , I am prepared to offer some help . Mr. and Mrs. Majelewski , we have tapes I think you will find very interesting . * * Now an important message from the world famous psychologist , Dr. Anthony Ferrel Bank . Does your teen-ager have a discipline problem ? Is he or she in trouble at school ? Involved with drugs , alcohol , sex ? At the Psychological Research Institute , we have the answer . Call us . Well , I don 't have a problem with drugs , alcohol or sex . So I guess we 're done for today , huh ? Sit down , James . You have a problem with your attitude and your disruptive behavior . Dr. Blake has seen some problem students and we 've seen terrific results . I don 't need to go to this guy , Blake ! Everyone knows he 's a flake ! You can 't make me ! James , you don 't seem to grasp the seriousness of what we 're discussing here or how earnest I am to change your behavior ! Jim , Dr. Blake wouldn 't be on TV if he wasn 't good . Mom , everything you see on TV is the truth ? Come on . I 'm sorry . I have reached the end of my rope . Jim , it doesn 't look like we have any real choice . Dad , what are you doing ? You 're going to sell me out ? What are you going to do if you don 't graduate ? Fine . Make the appointment . Thank you both for coming . Thank you both for coming . [ kissing noises ] Jim , Jim , I said no . Janet , we 've been going out for eight months . I know . We decided I 'm not going to do it until I get to college . What if we go to different colleges ? If you want to do it , you 're going to have to go to the college I go to . Come on , I 've had a really hard day , okay ? Sorry . I 'm worried about you . What are you going to do about Mr. woods ? I 'm going to go see that TV guy , Dr. Blake . You mean PRI ? Yeah , why ? Well , do you think that 's a good idea ? One place is as good as another . Except for some places that are better than most . Stop it . I 'm serious . I was talking to Sally and she said Becky was under treatment from Dr. Blake . So what ? So there is a lot of really weird stuff going on lately . * * All right . I agree with you . But why don 't we just talk about that tomorrow . Okay ? Just have a nice night together alone . Please ? [ Scream ] Oh , God . Scared your ass , didn 't I ? Willie . What are you ... Is that all you guys know how to do , play jokes ? That 's not all Willie knows how to do . [ Laughter ] [ Dog barking ] Evening , Officer Marks . All right , Majelewski , let 's move it . It 's past curfew . Thanks for reminding us . Come on , move it . All right ! Relax , we 're going ! Geez . See you later . I don 't know . Maybe I am crazy . You know you 're not crazy . Yeah , Marks needs a shrink . But they give him a badge and let him tell us what to do . Could you explain that for me ? Well ? No . * * * * * * * * Yes ? I 'm here to see Dr. Blake . Give me those . I didn 't realize there were so many crazy people in Meadowvale . Crazy people are that way . Follow the white line and fill these out . Have a nice day , buddy . * * Hey . You here ? They 're taking over . The aliens . Dr. Blake 's an alien . I tell everybody , but nobody believes me . You believe me , don 't you ? Sure , I believe you . They 're not going to find me 'cause I hide in my mind . Good thinking . Hey . Hey . How did you get out again , huh ? Hey , relax , buddy . He didn 't do anything . This is none of your business . Come on , let 's go back now . Come on . * * * * * * James Majelewski ? Yeah . You can call me Jim . Do you have any forms for me ? Right here . Parents signed the consent form . That 's good . We have to do a preliminary checkup . Can you lift up your shirt , please . Now ? Yes , now . Take a breath . Heartbeat 's excellent . That 's good to know . What are those ? * * Dr. Blake will explain everything . He 'll be with you in just one minute . Let 's get started . * * Dr. Blake . Hi . I 've seen you on TV . Ah . I want you to clear your mind , Jim . And I want you to answer my questions to the best of your ability , huh ? Okay . Keep your eye on the monitor . * * What is Vivian holding in her hand , Jim ? An apple . It is a baseball . I see an apple . Look again . Wait a minute . Nope . It 's still an apple . * * Look directly at the monitor . Now this is my kind of therapy . What do you see now ? Well , there is two of them . Two apples ? No , they 're not apples . But they 're round . * * * * * * What 's happening ? What is it , Jim ? What do you see ? * * * * * * [ creature growling ] You can go now . What the hell happened to me ? I 'm not some kind of guinea pig , you know . You 're supposed to be helping me ... It 's all right . You just suffered from an hallucination . That 's all . Get your hands off me , buddy . You 're crazier than that guy out in the hallway . * * Look . Its tail is growing . Its spinal cord . It 's a brain , not an animal . Right . Pick up Majelewski . I think it 's hungry . Don 't tease it . That thing is trying to control us . I can feel it . That is your imagination . There has been eight deaths since you began TV transmissions of the brain symbiotic wave . Is that my imagination , too ? There is no connection that can be proven scientifically . Resistance to the brain symbiotic wave causes hallucinations and you know it ! Your mediocre mind cannot begin to comprehend the importance of my work ! I suggest you look into your own neurotic behavior , then perhaps you will understand your continuing negativity ! You have to stop this insane research . That thing isn 't satisfied just controlling the minds of the people who watch your TV show ! It 's apparent you and I will no longer be able to work together . Fine with me . But wait ' til I tell people what 's really going on around here . Now take that thing and bury it where it belongs ! [ Scream ] [ Scream ] [ grunting noises ] It 's food for thought . * * Ah ! * * * * * * [ radio static ] [ radio static ] [ car noises ] [ car noises ] [ car noises ] [ car noises ] [ car noises ] [ car noises ] Ah ! * * * * * * [ car crashing ] * * * * [ explosions ] [ explosions ] * * * * * * Debbie , where is Janet ? Man , what happened to you ? Janet ! I got into a car accident . Jesus . What happened ? I 'm all right . You 're bleeding ! I 'm all right . I 'm just going ... can we just go in the back and talk ? Come on . Willie , get me a wash cloth . What happened ? I totaled my car . How ? I don 't know . I went to that PRI place and they did all this weird shit to me and made me hallucinate or something . What are you talking about ? I don 't know ! They did all this stuff . Apples and baseballs . Then Blake 's assistant 's blouse just floated off and she walked right out of the TV . You better not be joking around ! I 'm not joking , Janet . I 'm serious . I don 't even know what happened . I was just driving along and this thing reached out and grabbed me . I 'm taking to you the hospital . No , I don 't want to go to the hospital . Jim ! I don 't want any more doctors . You 're bleeding . You guys , the whole cheerleading squad just showed up . Can I get some help ? Willie . Janet ? In a minute . Come on ! In a minute ! Shut up , Debbie . I 'll be back here in ten minutes . Just sit down . Don 't move . Okay . * * Weird story , huh ? Thank you . Can I help someone ? Yeah , cheeseburger and fries . * * * * * * Can I have cheese on that , please ? Can I have cheese on that , please ? Janet , is Majelewski here ? Why ? I wasn 't talking to you . Why ? Is something wrong ? His car was in an accident down the road . I thought he might have come in here . You 're his girlfriend . You 're his girlfriend . What 's going on back there ? New stock clerk . He knocks things over all the time . Yeah . Yeah . Hey , real clumsy . * * Jim , calm down ! Jim ! Stop it ! Calm down ! Jim ! * * Jim ! Stop it ! Jim ! Don 't let him take me ! Stop it ! What are you doing ? What are you giving him ? Stop it ! Who are you ? I 'm nurse Varnim from PRI . He just needs a little more treatment . Where are you going ? Don 't let them take me . No ! What are you doing ? No ! Bring him back . Where are you taking him ? Wait ! You can 't just take him away . Yes , we can . We have a release form signed by his parents . Let me go with him . No , you don 't . Let go of me ! Let go of me ! Jim ! Let go ! Damn it ! Willie ! [ Car starts ] [ Car starts ] * * * * [ Hammering sound ] [ Hammering sound ] [ clicking noises ] [ clicking noises ] [ clicking noises ] Let me sneak in . You can sneak out . They 'll think I 'm you . They 'll never find me in here . Okay . Thanks . * * So you 're sure you want to do this ? Yes . Yes . * * Come on . Hurry up . * * Come on ! I 'm trying . It 's increased size , the brain waves we 're sending out could be even stronger . You 'll be reaching a wider audience . Soon it will be thinking for all those morons out there . Stronger it gets , the more minds it needs to control . Must expand or it will die . Get him ! Stop him ! * * * * [ gunshot ] * * Got it . Hurry up . Stay close to me . Stay close to me . * * * * * * Janet , we 're never going to find him up here . We have to , Willie . What do you mean we have to ? I don 't know . * * We can 't just leave him here . I know , I know . Janet ! Jim ! SHHH . There is two guys after me . We got to get the hell out of here ! Come on . But what ... what 's happening ? Watch out ! Come on . Hurry up . Oh , no ! [ Screaming ] * * [ creature grunting ] [ screaming ] [ screaming ] Over there ! The truck ! Where 's the hell the key ? Willie had them . Look underneath the dash . I think he 's got a hide a key . Shit ! Oh , my God ! Here , here ! Go ! Let 's go ! Go ! Drive ! [ Shots fired ] What the hell is going on here ? It 's that monster thing that 's killing everyone . I heard Dr. Blake talking about it . * * [ Siren ] You have to pull over . It 's the police ! We can 't trust them . We need help ! We can 't trust them ! Hold it right there ! You got to get back to PRI ! What are you doing ? We got to get back to PRI ! Listen to us . We saw Willie killed at PRI ! Please , we need your help ! Officer Marks , will you listen ? You killed Willie . I 've got an APB out on you . Are you crazy ? There 's a monster at PRI that 's killing people ! You 're as crazy as he is . Officer Marks , you 're making a big mistake . We got to get back to PRI ! Blake 's assistant just shot at us ! Shut up and get in the car . Would you listen , please ! Get in the car ! Hey , Asshole , we got to get to PRI ! Get in the car . In here ! Come on ! Get in the car ! Jim , look . I got both of them . It 's Blake 's assistant . They 're in the back of the police car . I 'm taking them down to the station . You can follow me . * * He 's coming after us . Jim ! Oh , God ! No ! Get out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Hey ! Hey ! * * Majelewski killed him ! Chopped his head off ! Chopped his head off ! We got to find somewhere to hide . How about the school ? It 's Saturday . Good thinking . Come on . [ background noise ] * * * * * * * * It 's very sad when a difficult case goes wrong . James Majelewski has trouble dealing with reality . Please , James , if you hear my voice , please turn yourself in before you kill again .

They 're wanted in connection with three murders . Get down ! Thank you very much , sir . Honey , wouldn 't you like to watch Dr. Blake with me ? No . You go ahead . I 'm not interested . It 's that asshole Woods . Come on . No . Please . [ growling ] Hey , what are you doing ? Put that thing down . That 's not funny . Put it down ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! [ Screaming ] [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] He killed him ! Majelewski cut him in half ! [ growling ] Get down ! [ Sirens ] Help me . Give me your hand . School 's not far . We 'll be okay now . * * We 're not going to be able to get in . Do not worry about it , please . What 's that ? Last year 's metal shop project . Hurry up . Let 's get these off . Okay ? I 'll find something in the metal shop we can use . There 's got to be something in there . Jim , I need to call my dad . He must be worried . I don 't think that 's such a good idea . Why ? He could help us . People would listen to him . He 's one of them ! What do you mean , one of them ? Didn 't you tell me he watches independent thinking every week ? That he really likes Dr. Blake . Well ? You can 't just say that . I mean , you don 't know that ! If you call him , he 's going to have the police down here after you . And then they 're going to find me . Look , just wait here .

Let 's sit down . We got to get back to PRI , and stop Blake somehow . How ? I don 't know . But I don 't think his hypnosis thing is permanent . If we kill the brain , everything should go back to normal . * * What was that for ? I don 't want to wait any more . You sure ? Yeah . * * * * * * [ growling ] * * * * [ growling ] * * * * * * Don 't take any chances . Shoot to kill . James Majelewski has trouble dealing with reality , but we here at the Psychological Research Institute can still help him .

You good people of Meadowvale who have supported our program so loyally , you are all independent thinkers . Huh ?

The sad tragedy of James Majelewski , something that has struck the hearts of all of us here in Meadowvale , he has killed several people and he is here in this building . My belief is that he came here for help and we , at the psychological research institute , can help him . Jim ! You have come for help . [ growling ] * * * * * * Look at this thing ! It wasn 't even human ! Dr. Blake was trying to take over by controlling your minds through television ! He 's the one who was responsible for all those murders ! I never killed anyone ! I 'm just a high school student ! He tried to use me just like he tried to use all of you . Everyone , please , look at the TV monitor because you know that 's the truth ! Please , look at the TV monitor . He tried to use me just like he tried to use all of you ! The truth is that it was him , not me ! * * Dr. Blake committed all those murders .

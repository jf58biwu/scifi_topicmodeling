 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . RALPH : Clara ? Are you coming ? CLARA : Have some more tea . I 'll be out in a moment . When I saw your picture , I had to meet you . RALPH : Are you really that beautiful ? CLARA : You can judge for yourself . CLARA : Are you ready ? RALPH : Yes . Clara , so beautiful . I love you , Clara . Clara ? Is that you ? Leonard , you said that you would have this room ... painted by the end of the week , last week . I 'm sorry , Mr. Francisco , it 's just that ... whoever painted here last , didn 't know what they were doing . Roland and I have had to spend all our time just spackling and priming . All of what time ? You haven 't been here for three days . It 's one thing after another , Mr Francisco . You see , I 'm trying to finish art school . I had to prepare an exhibit for my master 's degree . Someone stole two paintings out of my truck ... and on top of that I 've had finals . I can 't have this , Leonard , this disorder . It 's been a month . Mr. Francisco , I promise we 'll be out of here next week . Elek nos Valen . I have to get to work . Celine ! Sorry I 'm late , George , the traffic was terrible . What did the doctor say ? The sefu is fine . I 'm in my second week of incubation . GEORGE : I could 've told him that . Your scent ... I wish I didn 't have to go to work . George . What ? It 's not me , it 's the razviti hormone . You men get one whiff and you go wild . Yes , we do . You better go . LEONARD : That 's a beautiful dress , Mrs. Francisco . Thank you , Leonard . Did you know Leonard 's an artist ? He 's very good . I 'd love to paint you , Mrs. Francisco . Oh ! Well , thank you , Leonard . Why don 't you paint the house first , Leonard ? Leonard , I have to move that drafting table upstairs . I 'll help you . George , you 've to go to work , you 're late . Don 't worry , Mr. Francisco , we 'll take good care of your wife . You better make sure they put in a good day 's work . I 'll be home early . It 's called jealousy , George . It is not jealousy . It 's biology . The Tenctonese female in her first quarter of pregnancy ... gives off a scent that makes her extremely desirable to the Tenctonese male . IE all these other guys want to jump in the sack with your wife . You 're jealous , George . Face it . Hey , listen ... I just bought this great Three Stooges tape , all the best shorts . You wanna come over tonight and watch it ? Three Stooges ? Yeah , Larry , Moe and Curly . ( IMITATING THREE STOOGES ) " Come here , porcupine , I 'll murder you . " I 'm going home early . George , you can 't let a woman control your life . Thank you , Matt . When I want your advice , I 'll ask for it . MATT : Roscoe , what have we got ? DR. TAMAYO : It 's all there . Ralph Emerson ... simultaneous puncture wounds to both hearts , death was instantaneous . Tissue and blood samples show ... that the victim ingested a large amount of Sardonac shortly before death . Examination of the genitals show recent sexual intercourse . That 's the same MO as the guy last week , what was his name ? Alex Bell . Yeah . Just like this guy , huh ? Pickled in that love potion . Sardonac is no joke . It creates a tremendous attraction . When a Tenctonese has sex under its influence ... he or she is bonded , physically and emotionally . Yeah . Did you and Susan do that ? That is none of your business . No , we didn 't . Anything else ? Oh , yeah . They found these on the body . Wallet ... driver 's license , about $ 200 in cash , it wasn 't a robbery . Here 's something . " Nu-Mate Computer Dating Service . " JOHNNY : Ralph Emerson was a client , but I never met him personally . See , everything here is done electronically . We 're a bulletin-board operation ... clients talk to each other via our computer . We 're very Earth here , very modern . What do you mean ? Traditionally , Tenctonese do not search for mates . We feel a sense of rowkah , what you would call predestination . But that leaves so much to chance . This is scientific . Nu-Mate , new way . Look , say I wanted a date , how do I see what I 'm getting ? Do you ? What ? Want a date . Many of our Tenctonese women really like human men . I manage okay , thanks , Mr. Appleseed . Johnny . We fax our clients their date 's picture so they know exactly what they 're getting . JOHNNY : I notice you 're wearing a wedding ring . Happy ? Very , thank you . Look , can you tell us who Ralph Emerson dated ? Easy . JOHNNY : He went out with Miss Clara Bow just last night . Bingo . What have you got on this Clara Bow ? JOHNNY : Busy lady . Three different men in the last two weeks . Under type of male she prefers , she lists : tall , muscular , thactazoid spotting ... We 'd like a print-out of that plus information on her dates . No problem . And a picture of Ms. Bow . No problem . A real looker , huh ? MATT : Hey , George , get this , Alex Bell 's on the same list as Emerson . George ? Alex Bell ? The DB , our other stiff . What 's the matter with you ? Nothing . Dating is such a bizarre concept . You and your ex-wife , didn 't you feel predestined ? No , George , cursed . JENNY : Yes . Just a minute . GEORGE : Cursed , that 's very funny . We 're looking for Clara Bow . She 's not here . I 'm Jenny Moffat . I clean for her part-time . Yeah , well , we got a search warrant . Excuse me . We ... We 'd like to ask Ms. Bow a couple of questions . MATT : When will she be back ? JENNY : I don 't know . She at work ? What ? I don 't know . Am I making myself understood here ? You want this in Tenctonese ? George . Hey , George . About six months . Before that I was in the rehabilitation center . JENNY : You see , when our slave ship crashed ... I was near the engine room . I was burned . What can you tell us about Ms. Bow ? JENNY : Well , not very much . She 's rarely at home . She usually leaves my money on the dresser . She 's usually very generous . MATT : When did you see her last ? A few days ago . She was packing an overnight bag . Did she say where she was going ? No . MATT : You know , if you 're covering up for this woman ... if you 're protecting her , you could get in a lot of trouble . JENNY : I really don 't know . George , you find anything ? No . Hey , George , you skip breakfast ? You 're acting weird . " The face that launched a thousand ships . " Helen of Troy . For a Tenctonese , Clara Bow has that face . Whatever you say . I 'm putting an APB on her plus a 24-hour surveillance . There 's one other guy she dated , let 's check him out . A guy named Ted Healy . TED : No , I haven 't seen Clara . I 'm worried about her . Is she okay ? Has anything happened to her ? Not as far as we know . Mr. Healy , two men who dated Clara Bow have been murdered . TED : Murdered ? GEORGE : That 's right , Ted . You don 't think it was Clara ? No , I 'm sure she 's a regular Girl Scout . Hey , you watch your mouth ! Take it easy . Don 't you say anything against her , anything . Hey ! Matt , no . It 's all right . We are not accusing her of anything . She 's not just beautiful , she 's got a soul . Did you Sardonac with her ? No . When 's the last time you saw her ? About two weeks ago . I 've been calling every day since then . There 's no answer . I 'm worried . I can 't eat , I can 't sleep . Come on , George , let 's go . If you want police protection , I can arrange it . No , I 'm not afraid . I just want to see her again . I just want to see her again . STOOGE 1 : Take this bat . STOOGE 2 : Where 'll I put it ? STOOGE 1 : No , take the bat . Here , watch this . STOOGE 2 : I got it . Now what 'll I do with it ? STOOGE 1 : Stay down ! What ? I don 't understand it . What 's to understand ? It 's funny . He scraped a saw across his forehead ! I love it . It could 've hurt him . Nobody gets hurt . It 's ... Look what happened to the saw . Why is the dark-haired one so mean to his friends ? Moe . That 's just the way he is . Just go with this . Try to enjoy it . He 's hitting them and poking them . In the eyes ! Cathy , it 's make-believe . You just ... I don 't understand why anyone would hire them as carpenters . They 're totally incompetent , and they 're destroying the house . And the language . Do you know what " nyuk , nyuk , nyuk " means in Tenctonese ? Look ... I 'm trying to share something special with you . If you can 't appreciate it , just forget it . I 'm trying , Matt . It 's just not funny . How can you say that 's not funny ? What 's your idea of funny ? I rented a tape of Herbie , the Love Bug , I thought that was very funny . With Dean Jones and Buddy Hatchet . Herbie , the Love Bug ? Remember at the end , when the car is separated in two ... That 's not funny , that 's stupid . That 's for kids . And this is for adults ? I should 've known . You 're from outer space . How could I expect you to have a sense of humor ? I have a sense of humor . I just don 't have your sense of humor . Excuse me . I think I 'll go home and read a book . The body was found by a lifeguard washed up next to the Santa Monica pier . Clearly it 's a Newcomer . You know how they react to salt water . MATT : Grazer said we got a new DB , a real stinker . DR. TAMAYO : And gentlemen , we 've got this . The victim 's car was found at the scene . That and personal ID clearly identify the body as Ted Healy . And the spinal structure definitely indicates a male . Now there was massive destruction of tissue due to contact with salt water ... and I don 't have any chest cavity to examine ... but the clothes reveal double puncture wounds , presumably to the hearts . Just like Alex Bell and Ralph Emerson . You surprised ? We gotta find this Clara Bow . Thanks a lot , Doc . Wait . Was he Sardonacked ? I can 't tell . We don 't have the diagnostic equipment to scan for Sardonac ... not even to run a few standard tests . DR. TAMAYO : We 'll have to send the remains to UCLA . You do that . Come on , George , I wanna get my appetite back before lunch . Surveillance detail says Clara 's a no-show . She 's gotta pop up . She can 't exactly go south of the border and disappear . I 'm not convinced she 's the murderer . Of course it 's her . There 's no motive . George , it 's a classic , the black widow . First she mates , then she kills . I know , I 've dated a couple . Clara Bow is not an arachnid . A what ? A spider . You know , George , it 's not your brain you 're thinking with here ... it 's a whole other organ . What does that mean ? You got the hots for her . I will not even dignify that with a reply . What are you doing ? We have a warrant to access the computer at Nu-Mate Dating Service . I 'm placing a snitch in their system that will signal us if Clara Bow taps in . Okay , good . That 's good , George . Susan . Hi , I 'm home . Susan ? Buck . Buck . Hi , Dad . Where is everyone ? Em 's at Jill 's , and I don 't know where Mom is . She wasn 't here when you got home from school ? Uh-uh . It 's after 7 : 00 . Did Leonard say anything ? That artiste who has been painting our house for the past month ? No , he wasn 't here either . Maybe she had a doctor appointment . She had that yesterday . Could be that she went shopping for the nursery . We need a new harness for the pod . No , she already ordered that . Oh , you beat me home . Hi , Buck . Hi , Mom . What lovely flowers . These are for you . Oh , George , thank you . So , you 're home late . I was driving along and all of a sudden found myself headed for Palm Springs . I 'm gonna put these in water . You went to Palm Springs ? It was a beautiful day . The sun was shining , I felt wonderful . Blame it on the pregnancy . I just felt like getting some natural UV . I thought you might be over at Leonard 's having your portrait done . No . What should we fix for dinner ? The left-over weasel is fine . So , you went to Palm Springs alone ? Uh-huh . I could open a can of marmot . Yes . All right . So how is Leonard ? I didn 't see him . You know , George , he 's very talented . I think we should buy one of his paintings . Oh , you found it . Your purse fell over , these things jumped out . I was just putting them back in . It was going to be a surprise . I bought it in Palm Springs . The stone is real agate . Do you like it ? Yes , it 's very nice . Thank you . Hi . Matt . Look , I thought maybe we could try it again . Did you ever hear of W.C. Fields ? DANIEL : Hey , Cathy . CATHY : Just a minute , Daniel . Sorry , I thought you were alone . This is Daniel , Daniel Webster . CATHY : Daniel , this is Matt Sikes . DANIEL : Hi , there . Well , obviously you 're busy , some other time . CATHY : Are you all right ? MATT : Fine . Wait . You seem angry . I 'm not angry . Is it because of Daniel ? No , I 'm sure he 's a great guy . Matt , I 'm confused . Often , you act like you don 't really like me ... and now you seem angry because I 'm with someone else . Look , everything 's fine . Just fine . Maybe you 're looking for a different type of relationship . Something more intimate ? No . Why do you ask me things like that ? People don 't talk about relationships , they just have them . Oh ? But if I was gonna have a relationship , you know what I 'd want ? I 'd want someone you could count on . Someone who 's there , someone you could ... Who 's not off doing other things . Oh . I 'm talking hypothetically , of course . You understand ? No . I didn 't think so . I 'm driving down Broadway ... woman runs a light , almost hits me , she didn 't even see me . Didn 't even look . Why do they let them drive ? Matt , I 've done a terrible thing . Good , it 's about time . I 'm serious . I betrayed Susan . Yeah ? With who ? I betrayed her trust . I went through her purse . Oh , my God ! I thought she was with another man . You 're a real ping pong , George . One minute you 're hot after another woman ... next minute you 're worried your wife 's sleeping around . Is she ? No . What is important is this breach of faith , I didn 't even trust my own wife . Get real , George . I know women . They 'll lie , they 'll cheat on you . I told you before you 're jealous , and you probably got good reason . You should 've given Susan a dose of Sardonac . I 'm fearful , I admit that , but I am not jealous . You 're jealous . No . Jealous . No . I 'm afraid . But not for reasons you would understand . On the ship , we didn 't choose our own mates , the overseers did . Susan and I were no exception , but we were lucky . We fell in love after we were paired . Our love is strong . It 's real . I know that . But I 've often wondered , if Susan had had the choice ... to begin with , would she have picked me ? I 'm afraid , Matt . I 'm not jealous . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) What ? My scan on the dating service computer . Clara Bow has made another date . This man , Marvin Gardens . Clara ? CLARA : Have some more tea . I 'll just be a moment , Marvin . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) MATT : Police , open up ! MARVIN : Go away . Leave us alone . MARVIN : Go away ! MATT : Freeze , don 't move ! Stay there . Put your hands on top of your head . I 'm Marv . Shut up . We lost her , Matt . Matt , what a beautiful name . Don 't move ! George , what the hell is this ? Sardonac . I think he 's bonded to you . He 's what ? Matt . This was your first encounter with Ms. Bow ? Ms. Bow ? The woman in the hotel room , remember ? You have such a forceful voice , Matt . Don 't talk to me that way , just answer the question . DOBBS : Hey , what 's going on ? He 's ingested Sardonac . He has bonded to Matt . It 's none of his business . Bonded , whoa . You wanna take a hike , Dobbs ? Thank you . GEORGE : Mr. Gardens , when you spoke with Ms. Bow ... did she give you any indication where she might be staying ? We didn 't speak much . She was in the bedroom the whole night . You know , Matt , I like women , but I find you very compelling . Cut that out or I 'm gonna break your jaw . I mean it . I mean it . GEORGE : Matt , please , be patient . It 's the Sardonac . Sikes , am I gonna be hearing wedding bells soon ? Is he making fun of you ? No , I just respect true love . Don 't ever laugh at Matt . If he wants to laugh at me , let him . You 're a very forgiving person , Matt . Sit down ! And call me Sergeant . I think I 'll leave these two lovebirds alone . Look , I want some answers . You say you never saw this woman ... yet you go to a hotel and you drink this Sardonac stuff ... so that you can bond , or whatever you call it , with a perfect stranger ? I don 't remember anything about Sardonac , Matt . I mean , Sergeant . She must 've put it in his tea without him knowing . So there 's nothing you can tell us about Clara Bow ? She 's a face in a picture , that 's all . I 'm interested in someone much more real . Enough ! I 've heard enough ! Mr. Gardens , you can go . I 'd like to stay . Go ! Out ! Now ! Now ! He cares very much for you . GEORGE : Hmm . What ? MATT : " Height : 6 ' 1 " , weight : 180 lb . , spotting : thactazoid . " What ... I 'm trying to arrange a date with Clara Bow . I 'm accessing Nu-Mate 's computer ... registering as a single male , meeting Ms. Bow 's requirements . Another good idea , George . Just remember , she 's a suspect and you 're a cop . Oh , great ! Just great , I don 't believe this . How 'd you know where to find me ? I took your laundry ticket . It was on your desk . Who let you in ? I helped a woman with her groceries . Well , you 're out of here right now . Matt , please . Don 't call me that . Cathy , wait ! What is it , Matt ? She called you Matt . Look , you gotta help me . This guy drank some Sardonac and I can 't get rid of him . Is this a joke ? You two drank Sardonac together ? Not together , he drank it . Well , he 's bonded to you then . I know that ! ( WHISPERING ) How do I get rid of him ? Well , you should 've thought of that before you gave him the Sardonac . Don 't yell at him . I didn 't give it to him . I don 't even know this guy . Look , Cathy , it happened at work . I busted into a hotel room , he 'd just taken a dose of the stuff ... and looked at me and whammo . I see . He drank the Sardonac and you were the first person he saw . What 's so funny ? Oh , Matt , he 's perfect for you . He 's exactly what you wanted . He 's available , he 'll laugh when you want him to ... he 's someone you can control . Thanks a heap for the help . Matt , wait , I 'm sorry . Tell me , you haven 't had sex with him yet , have you ? Not yet . Shut up ! No , I haven 't had sex with him . Good , that 's good . As long as you don 't have sex with him , it 's okay . Okay ? What 's okay ? Well , if the person doesn 't have sex with the individual he ... or she is bonded to , the effects of Sardonac wear off ... in about a month . A month ? But if the person does have sex ... they 're bonded in eternal monogamy . I 'd try to avoid too much intimate contact , if I were you . Good night , Matt . Cathy . ( CATHY LAUGHING ) She 's very attractive . Have you known her long ? I want you to go home . Can I just come in a minute ? I 'd like a drink of water . Look , you like me , right ? You want to make me happy ? More than anything . I 'd be really happy if you went home now . You 're sure ? I 'd be ecstatic . Well , then I guess it 's good night . See you . ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( MOANING ) Clara ! No ! SUSAN : George , you had a nightmare . What was it ? Police business , a shootout . It seemed so real . Neemu , lie down . Susan , I 've been thinking ... maybe it 'd be a good idea if we Sardonac . Sardonac ? Why ? I love you and I want to reaffirm that , reaffirm us . I know you love me , George . Let 's go to sleep . Susan , I just think that we should make this commitment to one another . We already made a commitment . I still think it would be a good idea . George , what has gotten into you ? We discussed this years ago . We decided to love each other freely . Why are you so resistant ? I just want us to be happy . We are happy . But you 're not willing to Sardonac . Do you want an out from our relationship , is that it ? No ! I just want to have free will . Don 't twist this . Perhaps there 's something you 're not telling me . George , stop it . I love you , but I won 't do Sardonac . Sardonac is slavery , George . We 're not slaves . We have to accept every aspect of our freedom . Good night . MATT : What the hell are you doing here ? MARVIN : I brought you a present . I don 't want any presents . DOBBS : You 're a heartbreaker , Sikes . MARVIN : They 're argyles . They really bring out the color in your eyes . Dobbs , I 'm warning you . You 're out of here , now . Can I watch you work ? I won 't bother you . No . Sikes , don 't be so rough on the guy . Look , you gotta understand something . Don 't look at me that way . I 'm gonna try to be reasonable , but you gotta listen to me . You and me , it can 't work out . Why ? You 've got a chemical inside your body . What you 're feeling isn 't real . I 've never felt so real . This won 't work out , believe me . What am I saying ? It can work out if we try . We 're not gonna try , Marvin . It 's over , finito benito . It never was . Can 't we at least try to be friends ? No . Look , Marvin , for a Tenctonese , you 're not a bad-looking guy . You got a good personality , you 're generous . Look , in a couple of weeks , you 'll find someone else , you 'll forget all about me . Okay ? What can I say ? You 've made it clear there 's nothing I can do . Of course , I 'm disappointed . Very disappointed . ( PHONE RINGING ) Detective Sikes . Yeah ? Great . Thanks . That was a patrolman out at Rampart . Our APB on Clara Bow , he thinks he spotted her in Bradley Park . Let 's split up , we 'll have a better chance . GEORGE : Ms. Bow ! Ms. Bow , stop ! Stay away from me . What do you want from me ? I 'm a police officer . Police ? You 're under arrest , Ms. Bow . Why do you call me that ? My name is Bovary , Emma Bovary . See , Bovary , Emma Bovary . What do you want with me ? My agent says she 's never seen a model take off like I have . You remember Christie Brinkley ? She says I 'll be bigger than she ever was . MATT : Ms. Bovary checks out . She 's been in Paris for the last month . MATT : Someone 's been using her picture . EMMA : I did the St. Laurent fall line . And the Kleins came to see the show . Calvin practically begged me to come back to New York . It was embarrassing . GEORGE : But why did you run away from me ? I get hassled all the time by men . I was at George Hamilton 's last night and I told him that very same thing . You know , he knew exactly what I meant . You wouldn 't believe how good George looks and such a sweet man . EMMA : He promised he 'd help me any way he can . Well , thank you , Ms. Bovary . I 'm sorry if we 've caused you any inconvenience . You know , I don 't think I 've ever been in a police station before . Except for once in the south of France ... I was with this Count or this Duke or something ... anyway he was wild for me . We were in the hills above Monte Carlo ... Thank you , Ms. Bovary . Sure , any time . Au revoir . What a bumbo . Bimbo . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hey , George , your undercover line . Yes , hello ? CLARA : Hello , this is Clara Bow . Is this George Drum ? Yes , this is George . I 'd like to meet you , George . I 'd like to meet you too , Clara . I 'll be at the Rose Hotel . Room 101 , tonight at 7 . : 00 . Can you come ? Yes , I 'll be there and thank you . Goodbye . Well , I got the results back from UCLA . That body wasn 't Ted Healy 's ... but somebody sure wanted you to think it was . GEORGE : Ted 's still alive , and I 'm sure he was Sardonacked . A murder , so Ted could disappear . You 've been wanting a motive on this , George . I think I got one . Sardonac can make someone jealous enough to kill . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Clara ? GEORGE : Clara ? CLARA : I 'll be out in a moment . Have some tea . Make yourself comfortable . You like the tea ? Yes , very much . Clara ? I 'm coming . How do I look ? You look lovely , Jenny . Look at me . Where did you get this ? I worked at a modeling agency , bookkeeping . I took it . You made up Clara Bow . You bring in men with the picture ... you Sardonac them and you make love to them . Men are dead , Jenny , men you drugged . I didn 't hurt anyone . I didn 't kill anyone . Yes , I believe you . Do you remember Ted Healy ? He was the first man you met through Nu-Mate . Yes . We believe he faked his own death . We think the Sardonac has made him so jealous ... he will murder anyone he sees you with . I never meant for anything like that to happen . You don 't know what it 's like ... living with this face ... this body . But you had Ted . Why the others ? He wasn 't enough . I used to be so beautiful . Men loved me . I could have anyone I wanted . But after the crash , when this happened to me ... no man would touch me . I walk down the streets ... people stare at me , children point . I 'm sorry . I just want things back the way they used to be . ( TED GRUNTING ) Freeze ! No ! GEORGE : Are you all right ? ( MATT GROANING ) He 's alive . 1-William , 1-52 . We have an officer-involved shooting . Ambulance needed for Newcomer at Normandie and 26th . OPERATOR : Roger 1-52 . Where 'd you come from ? I followed you . I worry about you . Well , hey , Marv , thanks . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Clara ... I love you . I 'm sorry I 'm so late . Neemu , your shoulder . It 's not serious . It is not serious . The kids are both sleeping over at friends . I have a surprise . What ? Sardonac ? If it means that much to you ... Susan , I love you . George ! When we were paired , we had no choice . But because we love each other so much ... we must always have a choice . Freedom is difficult , but it 's better than the alternative . So much better . ( MOANING ) Hi . Hi . You busy ? Just paying some bills . Oh , what happened ? Oh , serious wound . I don 't have much time left ... Come on in . I thought maybe you might wanna watch a tape with me . That T.C. Fields you mentioned ? W.C. Fields . No , this is Herbie , The Love Bug . I thought you hated that movie . Well , someone I respect gave it a good review . I thought I ought to reevaluate it . Okay .

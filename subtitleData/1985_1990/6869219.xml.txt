 Mayday ! Mayday ! May- - Army ? Top secret and urgent . This way . Major . Even if the helicopter crash was deliberate ... the terrain would have made theft difficult . My men could 've done it without leaving footprints . the containers should weigh a ton and a half . I 've read the dossier . but ... We picked up the pilots two kilometers to the north . They 've been taken into custody and injected with sodium pentothal . It seems to have been engine trouble . Inform the men . over here . Call the specialist . What was inside ? I hear that a certain country 's robot weapons ... have six limbs . Let 's take a little walk over there . Don 't talk . Act normally . These are ... M-66 antipersonnel automated soldiers . The M-66 is supposedly the perfect robot ! Why didn 't they hide the containers ? Why didn 't they erase their footprints ? just tell us the facts . The M-66s are in the middle of a mission . A selected individual has been targeted . and then this happens . They should not have been programmed with a target in the first place . actually . Without a programmed target ... the M-66s would have buried themselves deep underground . we would 've had to demolish all structures ... in the area and do a thorough evacuation ... within their mobility radius to find them . — Who are the M-66s after ? — Who knows ? We 've finished . Tell everyone to stay away from the containers and the footprints . You and Rico check it out . What 's the mobility of an M-66 ? Since they 're not carrying coolant and counting on the cool-down periods ... I 'd have to say the mobility is roughly equal to a light truck . diplomats and any other VIPs ... from Central City and the surrounding forest . Use the police if you have to . You 're going after a story on the military ? You 're nuts ! — Then stay behind . — Here ? Whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! you 've separated from your husband again ? even by mistake . Do you like being married to your work ? It 's a damn sight better than some boring guy . A wrecked military craft . 000 rifle darts . what could we do ? They self-destruct and shoot those damned darts everywhere . go with Professor Slade and bring the man ... who 's responsible for all this to the Trunkline Road . Use the high-speed craft . We 'll set a trap there . Sybel ! Really bad ! I don 't want to trade my life for a scoop ! I want out ! I 've got nothing to do with this ! get out . But you 're gonna have to use your own two feet to go sell the film . you might make tonight 's news . That 's easy for you to say ! You haven 't got a family ! A guy who sleeps in my car hoping for a scoop ... hasn 't got a right to say " family ! armored thing on the road . We 'll never have a better chance ! This is what 's known as a " hot scoop ! there 's trouble with M-66 ! Come right away ! It 's an emergency ! and hurry ! Tell him there 's trouble in his area ! Sheesh ! Military Engineering Division- - it 's Professor Matthew 's granddaughter . One of those stupid soldier things broke the house again . if you don 't mind . Grandfather . Grandfather . Another failure ! Why ? Why can 't it hold the force back ? they could put up a force field barrier . the military is calling you . as usual . They keep interrupting my research . Even though they 're paying for this house and for your experiments ? I don 't recall having sold my soul . so take your key with you . The whole system has to be rebuilt . it can 't be beaten . We 've got a problem . You 're not the only one . I 've found a flaw in the system itself . That 's great . What are you saying ? You idiot ! Ow ! Ow ! it 's just the sound of an aircraft . I thought it was a wood spirit 's flute . What 's the matter ? What the- - What on earth could have done this to a bear ? Even its claws are broken . Major . The target should be located within the designated area . — How are the troops ? — Tense . They feel like they 're about to make contact with a UFO . Have they been equipped with what I 've asked for ? but the men aren 't used to- - just have them continue . Have you placed any men in the woods ? sir . Sir ? — Major ! zero degrees . Robots aren 't that stupid . It might be a trap . Use ten men . don 't engage them . Wait it out . sir ! What 's the situation ? The group back at the accident site has reported finding ... a dead bear and the bodies of two or three hikers in the valley . It seems to be the work of the M-66s . Judging from the hikers ' estimated time of death ... the M-66s should be here by now . Then get outside . Vehicles are dangerous . sir ! Why ? Why did you load the prototype target memory into the M-66 ? That-That had- - I wonder if it 's like a cruise missile or something . What 's gonna happen here ? I wonder if my wife would worry if I disappeared . is it safe here ? It is if you shut up and keep an eye out . I can 't get a good picture with you twitching like that . A freelance reporter . What in the heck are you doing dropping it in the first place ? detain them . That 's why I told you to keep quiet ! I thought I told you the program was just for test purposes . Are you sure it can hold the robot ? If you position it properly . — What ? — We 've lost two life readings . formation " C. I 'll leave it to you . we 've established contact . We 're pulling back . It 's gotten away . It 's been netted . So that 's the M-66 ? — What the- - — It 's the enemy ! Wires ! Attention all groups . The attacker is a diversion ! The other will cross the road . Ready the nets ! What are you doing ? Hurry up and capture it ! The data sheets gave no idea . Over there ! Ow ! — Stay still ! — There 's the other one ! Over there ! Good timing . Don 't let these two out of your sight . Over there ! this is our chance ! Wake up ! Here it comes ! back them up . Group Four . Enough with the fire already . Major . this- - spread out . Hold it down with that magnet thingamajig . It 's the scatter shot ! Bring the specialist here . take this . You put yours on as well . The other one ! Hurry up and do something ! — Don 't shoot ! We 'll hit each other ! — What are you doing ? Over there ! Don 't let it cross the road ! up above ! Pursue it with the thermograph . Major . don 't go into the woods . Gather all the able-bodied men and come with me . He was a friend of mine . I 'll get it for you . That goddamned monster ! Stop shooting ! It 's not here anymore . Ow ! All this because you shipped the product ... with the test program still loaded into it ! It was an accident . An accident ! the test program ... would 've been dumped when the real program was loaded . I should have made you the test program . even if it- - — Major ! Hurry up and go get it ! Just who did you select as the test program ? What ? ! It 's after my granddaughter ? You 've got to protect her ! Please ! I was using her as the test program . Are you taking into consideration the possibility ... that the crash and this battle may have damaged its program ? yes . let 's go . sir . We 're still investigating the thing as a possible Northern plot . It may not be after your granddaughter at all . Damn it . You don 't eat anything good ... and you 're still so goddamned heavy ! It 's because my head is packed so full . raw garbage . my back hurts . You oaf ! If I took a picture of you now . I bet it 'd come in handy later . I wouldn 't want my kid to see me like this . — Are you still gonna go for it ? — I 've only just begun . I 've seen that scientist somewhere . If I could just figure out where it was . It 's a Subaru with a turbo . It 's terrible the way they treat the stylists . But wouldn 't that be- - isn 't that Ferris ' - - It 's Grandfather ! I always did think he looked like a criminal . He 's published a book called Bipedal Walking and Its Control . Isn 't he a civilian employed of the army ? He 's just greedy . So the military was giving orders there and Professor Matthews was there too . Can 't get through here either . You can 't expect to find his exact address with just that clipping . But talk about finding luck in leftovers- - Huh ? There 's a boy with green eyes at the reception area of TFL TV . Will you deliver this film with the three stars on it to him ? So he 's the reason you 're on this story . Don 't give it to anyone else ! How do you expect to find the professor 's house ? Keep your voice down or the military will come . The reason there 's a trench is that there 's a house around . Don 't worry . I 'll find it . She 's obsessed . And I 'll be able to get this film on Midnight News . What is it ? The spy we 've placed in the technical division ... to disseminate false information to the enemy has- - — Weren 't you keeping tabs on him ? — No . But a technician had made contact with the spy . — A traitor ? — His family was being threatened . A spy arranged this little accident in order to inform his side about the M-66 ! The technician 's family has been taken into protective custody ... and the investigation has been passed onto external affairs . Very well . Initiate a level A-2 media control . What 's the technician 's name ? His name ! Don 't say it . Keep it quiet to the soldiers as well . sir . just as I thought ! It 's after my granddaughter . Ferris ! The robot I 've created is after Ferris ! so it 's likely to cause a panic . the fuel is beginning to- - I 'm going to distribute maps showing the mobility radius of the professor 's granddaughter . sir ! sir ! this is Ferris . I 'm dining out at Rampling 's . Grandfather . I 've programmed your dinner into Mayflower . this is Ferris . I 'm dining out at Rampling 's . Grandfather . I 've programmed your dinner into Mayflower . Wait a minute . A robot ? A military robot is after its creator 's granddaughter . And there 's no robot or army here ? shit ! The only ones who know the girl 's location are the robot and me ... and I just happened to see this answering machine message ! So what if it 's a robot ! I 'll show it a thing or two ! listen up . do not engage it . Our best bet is the Rampling restaurant on the 16th floor of this building . you go up and protect her . Nakamura ! why do I have to baby-sit ? Major ! You 're not thinking of letting it kill my granddaughter ... are you ? all communications will be on the emergency channel . Can you set up another robot to go after that one ? Not enough time ! — How about using a dummy ? — It 'll just make M-66 more cautious . booby-trap the building . I don 't want to lose any more men to that psychotic robot . sir . I won 't let it kill any more men . evacuate this building . — It 's performing even better ... gather at my position ... — than during the test run . - with equipment set " E. " — My apologies for the inadequate data . This is top secret . Take covert action . — How about it once in a while ? — I haven 't had any time today . — You 've got nothing to lose- - — A thief ! wait a minute ! make yourself more obvious ! you brats ! Don 't be so quick to shoot at people . The police . I wonder if they 'd believe me ? No way . The girl could get killed in the meantime . even if she had one . Maybe I could inform the military and back out . they 've already seen me . I 'll take this as far as it goes . that 's right . All clear here . We 'll continue our surveillance . What 's going on here ? Left at the next intersection . We 'll be at Rampling within a moment or two . It should be around here somewhere . it 's Grandfather 's robot ! F6-402 . What are you doing here ? — It 's here to kill you . — Wha- - Now wait a minute ! Who are you ? so listen up . — Morris ! Morris ! — Listen to me ! A military robot is here to kill you . We 've got to run ! Got it ? Major ! What are you doing ? Hurry ! We 've taken the professor 's granddaughter into our protection . Send her to the roof . pick up the granddaughter on the roof . Use the high-speed craft . go back ! do it ! go to the roof with these two . We 're going back for pickup . It 's a good thing we set up for it here . It 's too obvious . I hear that the military 's closed off- - it 'll move again ! I guess you 'd be a dropout as a reporter ... but I respect you for what you 've done . This way ! — It 's not here ! — What ? — The wires ? — It used its heat ray on the meat hooks . code one . The robot is on its way to you . partner . Open up ! It 's Paco ! It 'll be here soon . We 're on our way in a hurry to the roof . That way to the emergency stairs . What did you guys do to the F6-402 ? Grandfather- - Stop it . The military is doing their best here . Hurry up ! Come on . — Is there any other way out of here ? — Take this up ! We 'll buy some time . Turn on the donut . I 'll block all its functions . Damn it ! Did we do it ? Whoa ! It 's working . Perfect ! Hold it with the donut . I 'll call the pickup squad . We did it ! we have F6- - — Cut the power . Let 's see . plug in the tip of the red hair into the back of the head . Huh ? There 's two of them ! here it is . Do this . Press switch on forehead to deactivate the target lock . let 's go to the roof for the pickup . Is it over ? I leave the rest to- - The switch on the forehead ! The switch- - Don 't stop ! Please ! We 're almost there ! Run ! we 've located the F6 ! It 's on the top floor ! I 'm in pursuit of the target ! Pick up the target . I 'll catch up soon . — What was that ? — Hey ! It 's not the robot . It 's the target . Isn 't Paco with you ? we 've made contact with the target in the hall . Aid Roger in their pickup . The robot comes later . Roger ? and so is the professor 's granddaughter . No one else is in sight . Nakamura ! eight without a scratch . Over . I don 't see any wreckage . Move it ! Over here ! We 'll pick you up ! so latch on ! Got it ? cover them ! It might hit them . then ! sir . You saw what happened . The wire ! Lower me down to them ! that 's insane ! Do you expect me to just watch from here ? This is our last chance . Don 't get swept off by the blast . only the robot will be blown up . What 's your name ? Sybel . — Sybel . Sybel ! — Huh ? Thank you ! It 's a little early for that . There 's a rock in the timer 's way ! Why ? Why ? what have we done to deserve this ? Not bad . Should 've used a smaller basket . I guess . We 're saved . go ahead and move back . Eighteen men lost . I must be getting old . What can I say to their families ? how about a drink later ? What is it ? We 've picked up the robot . We 're on the way back . let 's go . can we land ? Don 't get in the way of the vehicles . Go around to the west side of the building . sir ! Do you always do this kind of dangerous work ? My danger is just beginning . the armor still looks like this ? Looks like the overheating damaged the circuits . There seems to be quite a bit of room for improvement . Grandfather ! You must have been scared ! But you didn 't let it get to you . I 'm so relieved ! Sybel ! No ! Don 't ! — What do you mean . " Don 't " ? — Grandfather ! What ? What 's the matter ? this isn 't something I can do anything about . do something about doing something . That 's not very scientific . Are you going to give up on the person who saved ... your cute little granddaughter 's life ? Let her go . Major ! I need your signature to arrange for a forensic expert ... to reconstruct the faces of the hikers . They might have been spies from the North . Be careful . I still don 't know why he let me go . This all may have been an act to promote anti-North feelings ... and that little white thing may not have been a secret at all . the official statement was ... Northern Terrorists Bomb Building . There were opposing views . But it 's easy to lose them in a smoke screen . I received three or so letters from Ferris but that was the end of it . I myself am not sure any of it really happened . I can 't even imagine that at the moment ... troops in the North might be fighting those dolls somewhere . My film and camera were confiscated ... but the one roll that did make it to Midnight News ... should enable me to buy new equipment soon . Good evening . most of you already know that ... there was an accident earlier this evening on the Trunkline Road . Midnight News has managed to obtain some footage ... of what might or might not be an accident . Richard Leakey . does it ? Indeed ! wouldn 't you say ? Obtaining this footage was very hazardous . Looks like the Special Forces ! during the fight it was too dangerous to shoot . even if I had to put my life on the line . Sy--Sybel ! In Ceramic City . Not knowing what to do . They are stray children . Just a rusty heart aching . Blue data is overflowing . Don 't show your plastic smile . Show your tears when you are sad . That 's why I like you . Pull Up ! Take care of yourself . Pull Up ! If you can go on . Pull Up ! Nothing matters . Pull Up ! I want this voice to be heard ! We 've been finally free ! We 've been finally free !

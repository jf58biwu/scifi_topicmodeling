 You have been warned . It feeds off the human psyche , seeks out the deranged , Oh , pardon me ... Oh ! Oh , n ... ! Urgh ! Not too little and not too much . That 's important ... Here we go ! I 'll just give your quarters a quick tickle around , sir . - Won 't take a jiff . - Not now . I 'm cooking . - I didn 't know you could do that ! - Oh , yes . I have add-ons for my groinal socket which allow me to perform virtually any household task imaginable . - Like what ? - Oh , you name it , buzz-saw , drill , hedge trimmer ... even an egg whisk . So , you stick the egg whisk on and you can whip up an omelette ? I can , but it 's amazing how few people are prepared to eat them . Goodness me ! I must have sucked up a penny . I better change the old bag . Yes , I 'll just get a fresh one . Mmm ! Something smells good ! What is it ? It 's me ! I love this aftershave ! You are minutes away from the greatest meal of your life . Set your taste buds on Def Con 3 ! Hey , where 'd you get all this stuff ? I got sick of plastic cutlery , so I went to the medical unit . This is a scalpel ! I 'm supposed to use something that 's been inside someone 's guts ? It 's all been washed . It 's clean . Something that once may have performed a certain popular Jewish operation ? I 'm supposed to eat with this ? Get the onion salads out of the fridge . " Embryo Refrigeration Unit " ? ! How many times ... ? It 's clean ! It 's been cleaned ! - Onion salads ... - They 're in the kidney bowls , next to the colostomy bag with the chilli sauce in it . Here we go ! Here we go ! Yahoo ! Come on , man . Come on . It 's ready . Sit down. sit down . One kebab for you and one kebab for me . Lemon juice ? - What the hell is that ? - It 's a syringe . - What kind of syringe ? - It 's for cows . Artificial insemination . It 's been washed . It 's all been sterilised . Do you want some ? - Excuse me . - What about the meal ? This isn 't a meal , it 's an autopsy ! - What about the main course ? - You think I got nothing else to do than watch you serve chicken chasseur in a stool bucket ? Charming ! I don 't know . You pull out all the stops , you make an effort ... try and do something with a bit of class , and where does it get you ? Mmm , very cheeky . Oh , I 'm sorry to interrupt , sir . I just need to get a ... Sorry . Oh , no , Kryten . It 's all right . Just running a few old home movies . That 's me , there . Those are my brothers - John , Frank and Howard . God , we were close . The Four Musketeers , we used to call ourselves . Well , the Three Musketeers , actually . I was always the Queen of Spain . Marvellous . Yes , I was the butt of the occasional practical joke , but I mean , er ... nothing sinister . Just the usual boyhood pranks , you know - apple-pie beds and black-eye telescopes ... One time , they even hid a small landmine in my sandpit . They took it from my father 's gun cabinet . How did they know it would go off ? - Marvellous guys . - Oh , who 's that ? - An old girlfriend , sir ? - Hardly . No , not really your type . Silly old trout like that . - She 's my mother . - Oh ! Oh ! I am so sorry , sir ... - Just forget it . - Oh , how can I forget it , sir ? I compared your mother to a foolish , aged , blubbery fish . I said she was a simple-minded , scaly old piscine . I intimated she was an ugly , lungless marine animal with galloping senility , a putrid amphibious gill-breather with less brains than a mollusc . Forget it ! Ah . Freeze . Ah , there she is . Magnificent woman . Very prim , very proper . Some say austere . Some took her for cold , aloof . Not a bit of it , she just despised idiots , no time for fools . Tragic , really , otherwise we would have got on famously . Well , if you 'll excuse me , sir . This is a private family moment . I 've no fish to embarrass you further . I 'll let myself trout . - Oh , sir , I 'm ... - Just go ! Don 't panic , Arn , but it does appear there 's a very tiny possibility that there may very well be a non-human life form on board . You mean like last time , when we got all worked up and went scooting off , complete with bazookoids and backpacks , and it was one of Lister 's socks ? I didn 't recognise the genetic structure . Biologically speaking , they were a completely new life form . Absolutely ridiculous . I felt a total goit . - Take a butchers ' . - Where is it ? I lost it . It 's somewhere along the habitation decks . Can 't get a moment 's peace ! - Enjoying your meal , sir ? - It 's de-smegging-licious , Kryten . It 's my own recipe , you know ? Shami Kebab Diablo . It 's beautiful . It 's like eating molten lava . I cooked up one for Petersen once . He was in sick bay for a week . - What ? - I didn 't say anything , sir . - You like them that hot ? - It 's trying to kill me . Oh , it 's a good one , huh ? - It went under here . - Are you all right , sir ? It 's gone . - What ? - How ? Where could it go ? We better go , Kryten . Something very weird is going on . Something very , very ... Ooh ! Sudden pain in my groin . - What 's wrong ? - Ah ! My underpants ! They 're shrinking . Oh , God ! Me boxers are alive , man ! They 're getting smaller ! Help me , please ! Please , I 'm begging you ! Get ' em off ! - Pull them down ! - Keep still ! Well , I can 't say I 'm totally shocked . You 'll bonk anything , won 't you , Lister ? - The boxers , where are they ? - I put them here . - You sure ? - There 's nothing here . Just the blanket and the ... Snake ! - Snake ! - Kryten ! - What the smeg is going on ? ! - I hate snakes . They freak me out totally , snakes . They are my all-time second-worst fear , guy . What 's your first ? This . Is he OK ? - As far as we can tell , yes . - Where 'd it go ? It turned into a squelchy thing and squidged off down the corridor . - What is it ? Some kind of alien ? - No , it 's from Earth , man-made . I checked its DNA profile . A genetic experiment that went wrong . Apparently , it was an attempt to create the ultimate warrior , a mutant that changes shape to deceive its enemies . - So what did go wrong ? - It 's insane ! It feeds off the negative emotions - fear , guilt , anger , paranoia , drains them out of its prey . It 's a sort of emotional vampire . It changes shape to provoke a negative emotion . It took Lister to the limit of his terror , then sucked out his fear . - So now Lister 's got no fear ? - Precisely . - What are we going to do ? - I say let 's go and twat it . Lister , you 're ill . Leave this to us . I could have had it , but it took me by surprise . Lister , it turned into an 8ft-tall armour-plated alien killing machine . If it wants a barney , it 'll get one . One knee in the happy sacks , it 'll drop like anyone else . Fine . We 'll bear that in mind . I 'm gonna beat it to death with its own tonsils . Yes , yes . Very good . I 'll stick my fist so far down its gob , - I can pull the label off its pants . - Yes , yes . Kryten ... What 's that ? You starting trouble ? It 's just something to calm you down , sir . Come on , then . All of you slags ! All together or one at a time . It 's all the same to me . I 'm ... Thank God for that . Right , we have two options - one - we take it on and kill it , or two - run away . - Who 's for two ? - Two sounds good to me , sir . It 's always been my lucky number . - Right , let 's load up Starbug . - What about Lister ? Seal the hatch from the inside . He 'll be safe until we go . - Remember , it could be anything . - Let 's move it . What about the Space Corps directive which states that our primary duty is to contact other life forms and bring them home ? What about the Rimmer directive , which states , " Never tackle anything " that 's got more teeth than the entire Osmond family " ? It 's here . - Where ? - Somewhere . Set the bazookoids to heat-seeker . When you see it , aim roughly in its direction , and the heat-seekers will do the rest . In the shadows ... It 's in the shadows ! There ! There ! There ! Sorry . My fault . False alarm . Idiot . I don 't understand , holograms don 't produce heat . Neither do androids . What are they homing in on ? So long , guys . Oh , come on ! Give me a break ! You either got it or you ain 't , and , boys , you ain 't even close . Cat , where are you ? - Over here . - Stay put , we 'll come and find you . Keep talking . What are you looking for ? A mutant . It 's dangerous . It can turn into anything . Oh , sounds pretty scary . It is , baby . Believe me . It must take a really brave sort of guy to do this kind of work . - Well , I guess you 're right . - And I bet you have to be smart . Smart ? Yeah , you definitely have to be smart . It can turn into anything . You gotta have your wits about you . Don 't let up for one second , or - blip ! - you 're dog meat . - Come on , babe . - You know , you 're quite a guy , - Brave , smart , handsome ... - Oh , you think handsome ? Oh , come on . You 're probably the best-looking guy I 've ever seen . - I wasn 't going to be first to say . - Do you know what I 'd really like ? To make love to a guy like you . Well , I 'm sure I have a window in my schedule somewhere . Let 's see ... What are you doing in , say , ten seconds time ? - Nothing I couldn 't cancel . - Hi . I 'm the Cat . Hi . I 'm the genetic mutant . Glad to know you . Jenny who ? It 's got him ! Oh ! Oh , my goodness ! Are you all right ? - Is he dead ? - Unconscious , but , according to the psi-scan , he 's lost an emotion . - Which emotion ? - He 's lost his vanity . - This is your fault , Kryten . - M-M-My fault ? We were supposed to stick together . - But it wasn 't ... - He trusted you . Now look at him . - Oh , please . I feel so ... - Guilty ? - Yes . - Good ! Hah ! Shoo ! Shoo ! - Let 's get out of here . - It 's got my guilt , the one emotion which prevents my transgressing the mores of civilised society . Stop your blithering , Kryten . Let 's go . Oh , screw you , hadron-head ! Where have you been ? Let 's go ! I was getting myself comfortable , man . - Come on , Kryten . You 're holding us all up . - Who cares ? - You 'll get us all killed . - So ? Oh , look . It 's Bonehead 's mum . - Mother ? - Hello , dear . - What are you doing ? - What does it look like , darling ? - You made love to my mother ? - Yeah . What of it ? - It 's the polymorph ! - You 've just had my mum ? ! Five times . He was like a wild stallion . " Very prim , very proper . Almost austere . " It 's trying to make you angry . Darling , I wish you could have seen him in action . He was like a set of pistons in an ocean liner engine room . I think I 'm going to be sick . - Don 't get angry . - Lister and mother ... it 's a dream come true . He 's so energetic . I honestly thought my false teeth were going to fall out . - Lovely . - The positions he bent me into ! Terrific . That sounds enchanting . Well done . And the things this boy can do with Alphabetti Spaghetti . - Cool it , Arnie . - ALPHABETTI SPAGHETTI ? ! - Where is it now ? - It 's gone back to the cargo bays , sleeping off a four-course meal of fear , vanity , guilt and anger . Just because it 's an armour-plated alien killing machine that salivates unspeakable slobber , doesn 't mean it 's a bad person . We need to put together a solution package over tea and biscuits . Look at him . You can 't trust his opinion . He 's got no anger . He 's a total dork . Good point , Kryten . Let 's take that on board , shall we ? David ? Do you have anything to say ? Well , yes . I have , actually , Arnold . Let 's go to the ammunition stores , get the nuclear warheads and then strap one to my head . I 'll nut the smegger to oblivion . Right , well , that 's nice , David . Let 's put that on the back burner . Cat , let 's have your contribution . Come on . Hey , don 't ask me , I 'm nobody . Just pretend I 'm not here . That 's lovely . Thank you very much . Moving on a step ... and don 't think that I 'm setting myself up as chairperson . Just see me as a facilitator . Kryten , what 's your view ? Well , we should send Lister in as a decoy , and while it 's eating him alive , we could blast it into the stratosphere . Good plan . That 's the best plan yet . Let it get knackered eating me to death , then you guys , like , catch it unawares . Well , that 's certainly an option , David , yes . Um , but here 's my proposal . Let 's get tough . The time for talking is over . Call it extreme , but I propose we hit it hard and hit it fast with a major , and I mean major , leaflet campaign . And while it 's reeling from that , we follow up with a whist drive , a car-boot sale , some street theatre and possibly even some benefit concerts . OK ? Now , if that 's not enough , I 'm sorry , it 's time for the T-shirts . " Mutants Out . " " Chameleonic Life Forms ? No , Thanks . " If that 's not enough , what is ? Has anyone ever told you that you are a disgusting pus-filled bubo who has all the wit , charm and self-possession of an Alsatian dog after a head-swap operation ? Listen , you bunch of tarts , it 's clobbering time ! There 's a body bag with that scud-ball 's name on it . I 'm doing up the zip . Anyone who gets in my way gets a napalm enema . I think everybody 's right , except me , so just forget I spoke . Um , I think we 're all beginning to lose sight of the real issue here , which is what are we going to call ourselves ? I think it 's a choice between the League Against Salivating Monsters or my own personal preference , the Committee for the Liberation and Integration of Terrifying Organisms and their Rehabilitation into Society . Erm , one drawback with that , the abbreviation is CLITORIS . Look , it needs killing ! If that means I sacrifice my life in some pointless way , all the better . Yes . Even if it doesn 't work , it 'll be a laugh . Right , so let 's just cut all of this business and get on with it . Last one alive 's a wet ponce . Who 's with me ? Well , the car stickers aren 't ready till Thursday , but sometimes one just has to act spontaneously . - People , let 's go . - I 'm coming , too . Maybe I can bum some money . Maybe if I hand you guys over , it 'll let me go . Move it , suckers ! # Love everybody # All you need is love ... # Come on , you chicken ! Show us your slobbery chops and we 'll blow them off . Here they are , nice juicy humans . Come and get them . Here , mutie-mutant ! Phewee ! What am I wearing ? Oh , how can you ever forgive me , sirs ? Naturally , I will commit suicide immediately . Hey , we were all a bit whacked out there . - You can say that again . - Come on , let 's clean up . If I don 't get into evening wear , I 'm going to have to resign my post as Most Handsome Guy on the Ship .

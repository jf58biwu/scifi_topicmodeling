Will I see you later ? With your track record , without a doubt . Thank you for saving me , as usual . - I really gotta go . - Hm .

Catherine ? ( woman on TV ) Steveland Morris is Stevie Wonder . ( man on TV ) Oh , you 're all good .. Let go of me . [ alien growling ] Those fraternity guys are maniacs . I never thought Lana would 've anything to do with their dopey stunts . ( man on TV ) Within the past 50 years a number of famous people have disappeared and never found . I 'll give you information of three of them you tell me their names . Look at the screen . The woman aviator lost in the pacific- - [ whooshing ] [ instrumental music ] # Here I come to save the day .. # [ growling ] Somebody help me ! Somebody .. [ sobbing ] Wait a minute guys ... I don 't think she 's kiddin ' . Come on , let 's see what 's happenin ' . - Get off of me . - Hey , man . The girl ain 't laughing ' . Why don 't you put her down an take a hike back to history , alright ? [ growling ] Okay , now beat it . Yeow .. [ firing ] [ phone ringing ] Hello . [ grunting ] What do you want from me ? Superboy ! You will bring him to me . Me ? I can 't . I don 't even know where he is . I have been watching . When you are in danger , he comes . Now you are in danger . - Hey , Clark . - T.J. , what 's going on ? ( T.J. ) You know , that picture of me and Fisher in the Daily Planet ? There was something wrong with the cropping or something . There was a big fight . - How 's your dad ? - No , he 's okay . - It 's not like before . - Well , that 's good news , right ? - Yeah . - I told you , he 'll be better .

[ laughing ] Yeah . - Alright , I 'll see you later . - I 'll see you then . Okay , bye . [ woman screaming ] [ people screaming ] Hey , Henry , what 's going on ? Some weirdo with the biggest Roman Candle I ever saw . And he 's shooting it at everybody . He 's got Lana . Do you hear me , Superboy ? Come and face me . ( alien ) Hey-y-y .. [ theme music ] I watched you long enough and now I 've come to challenge you . There 's no need to shout , mister . [ growling ] ( Lana ) Superboy , he 'll kill you . Eventually , I shoot them all . Let her go . She has served her purpose ... for now . Prepare yourself , Superboy . This body is strong and fast . It has seen many battles on many worlds . But , you are it 's greatest challenge . Get back , Lana . This might get nasty . - But , Super- - - Do it . Ah .. [ sizzling ] No ! [ growling ] Away from here . [ theme music ] Did you kill her ? [ music continues ] Hi-ya ! Ah ! Ah ! [ zapping ] [ groans ] Ow ! ( alien ) Ow ! You are indeed a great warrior . Your body 's vast powers have served you well . If only they were mine . [ siren blaring ] [ car door opening ] No pulse . ( male # 1 ) She 's dead too . [ sighs ] She 's gone . There 's nothing you can do . [ sighs ] No . [ dramatic music ] [ heart thumping ] Her heartbeat , it 's faint , but it 's there . ( male # 1 ) Bring the ambulance . [ music continues ] [ ominous music ] [ monitor beeping ] ( Clark ) How is she ? ( female # 1 ) I don 't know yet . We 're still waiting for the test results . [ beeping continues ] Clark , our nurses are monitoring her condition . Any irregularities , they 'll pick up . Sitting at her bedside isn 't going to do either of you any good . You could probably use some sleep . I couldn 't sleep if I wanted to . What about that thing ? Did Superboy kill it ? Well , it 's certainly dead but I hardly think Superboy 's the one who killed it . What do you mean ? It 's no life form we 've ever ... encountered . One thing we know for sure .. Whatever this creature was , it 's been dead for years . How can that be ? I watched Superboy fight it . The one thing it wasn 't was dead . I know , that 's what has us stumped . The body itself seems perfectly preserved . We even extracted some fluid from it , a chemical . Similar to formaldehyde . Embalming fluid ? That doesn 't make any sense . I know . They 're waiting for me in surgery , Clark . I have to run . I 'll come by and check on her . [ sighs ] [ beeping continues ] I 'm supposed to be doing some good here . Helping people , not endangering the ones I love . Especially you . [ instrumental music ] [ sighs ] When we were kids in Smallville you were like my little sister . You were always there for me . And I was always there when you needed me . Until today . I hate seeing you like this . [ music continues ] So helpless . There 's things , that if I told you I know that you would understand . But there 's one secret that will always keep us apart . A secret that I can only tell you in my dreams . Why does it have to be so hard ? When I 'm Clark , you 're like my little sister . But when I 'm Superboy .. ... you 're the woman I love . Lana ? Lana ? [ growling ] Lana , what are you doing ? [ dramatic music ] [ glass shattering ] You , what have you done to her ? ( alien ) This body is weak . Useless to me . It brings me no closer to my goal . If I so desire .. ... I 'd destroy your soul . [ music continues ] But you are what I came for . I can 't fight you . Not Lana . This body has greater power than I thought . Through her , I can get to you . Surrender yourself , and the girl will live . - Refuse me , and I 'll- - - No ! You destroyed the body that I cherished the most . And , now I 'll destroy the body that you cherish the most . No , don 't hurt her ! I 'll do what you want . I want to fight on my terms . Release her , and you got your way . [ growling ] [ ominous music ] [ whooshing ] [ beeping continues ] [ theme music ] [ whooshing ] [ sizzling ] [ ominous music ] ( alien ) It 's useless to resist me , Superboy . They all tried . The ones unconscious , I conquered them from within preserving their bodies and adding them to my army . You killed them just to use them to kill others , why ? Why ? For the power ! I 've traversed the cosmos searching for the mightiest beings in greed . Each one I conquered was stronger than the last . Now , the ultimate is within my grasp . You ! Sorry , but this body 's not big enough for the two of us . You fool . You are a fighting machine of unparallel power . But , you squander that power by helping others . I envy your body , but have only been temperate around you . Such power is wasted on you . But , under my control , it 'll conquer worlds . I 've never killed anyone , and nothing can make me . You have no choice . I outnumber you three to one . Three of the greatest warriors of the galaxy . I can beat anybody , or all of them . [ sizzling ] [ music continues ] Or none of them . [ explosion ] ( alien ) You 've destroyed everything precious to me . All that I have left , is my revenge . Now , I must return to your world and take your Lana from you . ( Superboy ) No . [ theme music ] [ whooshing ] Give up , Superboy . It 's only a matter of time . And since you can 't kill me I 'll have all the time in the world . She will be mine , for within her I will watch as you die in despair . No . [ sizzling ] [ inhaling ] [ exhaling ] [ whooshing ] [ monitor beeping ] [ sighs ] [ bed whirring ] Hello , Clark . Oh , sorry , ha . You look much better . I feel better . Tired , but better . How long have I been out ? Oh , what happened to that monster ? Well , there 's a rumor that , Superboy has it under control . You know .. ... I had the strangest dream about you two . That Superboy was you and- - And I was Superboy ? That 's good . Dream on , Lana , dream on . [ sighs ] Stay cool , man . [ gurgling ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

They don 't have STOP signs in Zorkon ? Do you believe that beings capable of interstellar flight have come here out of simple curiosity ? If you believe that , then you ask yourselves this question : Why have they started off with the cold-blooded murder of photographer Paul Forrester ? Yes , you 're right ! I have no proof , no proof yet . You give me the additional men , and equipment and your unflinching support and I 'll bring you proof , I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . What are you doing ? We can 't stop for them . I thought you said you 'd never pass another person that needed a ride . I better watch what I say around you . You need some help ? Yeah , our car 's broken down . I don 't know what 's wrong with it but thanks for stopping . You know anything about cars ? I know they cost a lot of money . Yeah , you 're telling me !

Mum , what 's the problem ? Why don 't we just call Dad ? He 'll send someone to get us . We don 't anyone to come get us . Car will be ready in the morning . There 's no reason we can 't take care of this ourselves . Well , just do what you can and we 'll come back tomorrow . Sure thing , ma 'am . Mum , where are we staying ? We 'll find a place ! Don 't worry about it , come on ! Where 's your sense of adventure ? Excuse me , how far is it to Simpson 's Lodge up by Spirit Lake ? A little late to head out there right now . Get yourself an early start tomorrow morning . You 'll make it there by the afternoon . Great , thanks . Alright . It looks like we 're going to be here for a while . There 's a diner , let me buy you something to eat . Mum ! These guys probably have their own plans . They don 't want to be saddled with the two of us . Nonsense ! It 's the least we can do ! That sounds good . So , erm ... is this one of those weekends for you too ? What ? Well , you know , get to know your parent . They get uptight and decide you haven 't spent enough time together so they drag you off to the lake for some quality time ? Yeah sure , me too . And I had to practically drag her out here , as if spending the weekend with her mother was Chinese water torture or something . Listen to me , you 've probably been have through the same thing yourself a thousand times . It 's what having a teenager is all about , right ? So where are you two headed ? Spirit lake , we 're going to a place called Simpson 's Lodge . Oh yeah , I know that place . It 's on the south shore . It 's kind of old , a little funky but it 's clean . So , you two are going to do some fishing there ? I hear the trout 's pretty good . Yeah , trout . We figured we 're doing a little fishing over the weekend . Great . Yeah What do you do Paul ? For a living ? I 'm a photographer . A photographer ? Really ? Well , you must really like it up here . It 's so beautiful , and you can breathe ! ( Is everything alright over here ? ) I breathe everywhere . Well , sometimes in the city I wonder . Everywhere I go , I find something beautiful . Up high it 's cool and green . And here it 's warm and the colours are changing . I 've also been where it 's hot and dry , and gold with sand . It amazes me . Honey I knew that . You kids ought to know better that to play with food . Well , we gotta go know . It 's been great talking to you . We 'll see you around . What ? Wait a second ! What 's the hurry ? Thanks for the food . Can you give us a ride to a motel or something ? - Yeah . - No ! - Come on Beth , let 's go . - I haven 't finished my food ! We can 't make it . What the ... ? Hey , hey ! Come back here ! Stop ! This is the police ! Shall we go ? Charlie ! Charlie , knock it off ! Hey Mister ! Mister , I wouldn 't do that if I were you . He 'll take your hand right off . Mister , stay away from here ! Well , I 'll be ... We need a cabin . You must leave right , Mister . Someone 's checking out . It will be ready in a while . Hunting season opens tomorrow . Couldn 't find another room if your life depended on it . It will be 38 dollars in advance . I got us a cabin . - What ? We can 't ... - No way ! We couldn 't get another room if our lives depended on it . No sorry , can 't say they were here . Now , there was a kid here a while back . No , it couldn 't be those four then . Alright look , thanks . I 'll check down the road . Alright . I 've been trying to get you since 5 : 30 What the hell is going on with you and Shannon ? What are you talking about ? She picked Beth up today after school and they both headed out of town . Yeah , they wanted to spend the weekend together , so ? Dana , the bank called . She 's cleaned out your joint accounts . I think you better tell me what 's going on . I told she can do whatever she wanted to ... Change her life , move to the woods and eat beans for all I care but not with Beth ! Not with my daughter . She 's Shannon 's daughter too . You find them , Dick , I don 't care what it takes or what it costs but you get my daughter back here . Well , I got pictures of Beth circulating but it 's not that simple . You can 't very well say she kidnapped her own daughter . For what I 'm paying you , you can call it anything you want . You just get my daughter back ... personally ! We can 't do this , mum . No way ! We don 't anything about these guys . You heard what Paul said , there aren 't any other rooms . So we 'll go home ! So ? We 'll blow the weekend . We can come again some other time . We don 't have a car ! So , call Daddy ! He 'll send somebody . Honey , we need this time together . We can 't spend the night with them . You just don 't do stuff like that . Why not ? Just cos it 's not done ! But if we do it , then it 's done . Besides , this way we won 't stick out like a couple of sore thumbs . Something about Paul ... I don 't know what it is but I trust him . So trust me , everything is gonna be fine . Where are we all supposed to sleep ? Well , there 's a tiny bed up there , looks like the one Goldie-Locks used . Well , you and I will take the big bed and the two kids can use the little one up there . What ? He 's always joking around . He 's such a kidder . No , we 'll bunk together and we 'll go up to the car and get the rest of the luggage . You trust him ? He was kidding ! Right ! ( Right , show me your cards ) ( - What do you mean ? - Show me your cards ! ) ( Pay me , river boat ) ( You know , I 'm tired of playing cards , I 'm really tired of playing cards with you ) Did those people wake you up ? I couldn 't sleep anyway . What are they doing in there ? They 're hunters . What are they hunting ? Nothing yet . Right now they 're just drinking beer , playing cards and telling jokes . Tomorrow they 'll go out , shoot anything that moves . Shoot ? Kill . So , which one is it ? There . Just over the horizon . That one . What are you doing ? I saw Shannon do that to Beth . Yeah , I don 't know if I 'm ready for that just yet . Why ? Cos I don 't know if I can count on you . That 's why . Define " count on " . It means to trust . To do something somebody asks you to do , even if you think it 's dumb . I think we should trust each other . What do you want from me ? You don 't have anything to do with my life . Not the whole time I was growing up . And you can 't just appear and expect me to ... I 'd say something wise and helpful but I 'm hardly the person to do that . I don 't understand my son . You remember what it was like to be fourteen . What would you do if she didn 't like you ? Beth not like me ? That 's absurd ! She loves me ! She 's my daughter . Does she love her father ? I don 't know what it is about you . Why do you ask questions like that ? She wishes he was here . Beth and I need time alone , away from her father . Sometimes people just need to be by themselves and get away from each other . I was away from Scott for many years , most of his life . I never had anything to want to get away from . It 's chilly . I 'm gonna go inside . I haven 't seen one of those things in years . Neither have I. Too bad we don 't have any eggs . Yes , too bad . I 'll tell you what ... my car is supposed to be ready now , if you could give me a ride into town , on the way back we 'll pick up some eggs and I 'll make some omelets . What a good idea . Fox ? Scramble AB jammer . Yes , General , this is George Fox . I apologize for all the cloak-and-dagger routine , Sir . Yes Sir , very close . Yes , that 's my point exactly , Sir . They 're in the area , I think this is the time that we should mobilize our full resources . Yes , Sir . I do understand , Sir . However , I simply cannot follow up on every lead myself so , if you could ... No , no , no , please don 't misunderstand me , General . I 'm not trying to tell you how to run your organization Yes , Sir , I will keep you informed . Yes , Sir . I 'll look forward to that , the very next time I 'm in Wash ... Thank you . Hi . Hi . We 're early . They went back to pick up the car . I 'm starving . Well , we got some left-over pizza . Sounds fine . Hey ! Here 's a root beer . You want half ? Sure Your mum seems real nice . Yeah , she 's great . Where 's your dad ? Working . They both work . Which is a good thing , you know ... I mean ... I have my life , they have theirs , I don 't have to be worrying about them all the time . The freedom is kind of nice . Parents can be a drag . So how about your mum ? Where 's she ? We 're on our way to meet her . I haven 't seen her in a long time , I don 't really know her . Your dad seems like a great guy . Yeah . No , I mean it . He asks a lot of questions . You know , like he really cares what you think . Regular prince . What 's with you ? Sorry I don 't mean that . No , I 'm sorry . It must be tough having only one parent around . Are we in a hurry ? No , this is fine . I like to see what I 'm going past . Oh God ! Just keep going ! Why ? What 's wrong ? Just keep going ! We gotta turn around and go back . What is it , Janet ? What do they want with you ? I just got a bunch of parking tickets I didn 't pay . Parking tickets ? I guess I 'm just gonna have to trust you . I took Beth and ran . Now , can we go back now ? What are you running from ? Mu husband , my job , my life ! Beth doesn 't know , I haven 't told her yet , now . Please Paul , you 've gotta help me ! I don 't wanna lose her ! Get your things together , Beth , we 're leaving ! Why ? What 's the matter ? Paul and Scott are giving us a lift as far as Spirit Lake . Wait a minute ! Where 's the car ? Well , ah , it wasn 't ready . We can 't just leave it ! Sure ! We 'll pick it up on the way back ! What happened ? People are after them too . There were police all around their car . Them ? What for ? What did they do ? I don 't know . I think it has something to do with Shannon running away . She hasn 't told anyone , she hasn 't told Beth . This is all we need ! We 're already fugitives , we can 't have them ! I think we have to . They have no-one else . We 're half a day from Spirit Lake . I just wanna find my mum ! We 'll go to Spirit Lake . I 'll help you look for Jenny Hayden , when we find her , I 'll leave . If that 's what you want . But I 'm not going to leave them here , we won 't leave them here . I called Daddy while you were gone . Mum , why won 't you tell me what 's going on ? I will Beth , I promise you I will ! Now ! I 'm sorry Beth , I 'm so sorry ! I didn 't wanna have to tell you this way , I thought if we could be alone , by ourselves , You and Daddy , I should have seen this coming . I just thought that after we talked that you 'd wanna come with me ! Do you expect me to just pick up and run away with you ? Beth , we can work something out , trust me ! Trust you ? Why ? You didn 't trust me ! You lied to me ! I thought you wanted to be with me , Just the two of us like when I was little , I don 't ... I don 't know if it means anything , it 's just a stupid thing . Neither of you give a damn about being with me , I 'm just a trophy that proves which one is the winner . Beth ! Might I ask your interest in this , Sir ? I 'm his attorney A friend of the family . They had a meal in there yesterday , they were with a man and a teenage boy . What man ? They left the city alone ! She wouldn 't just abandon their car . Excuse me a moment . He 's not involved , Sir , he 's only interested in the woman and her daughter . Alright , we know they 're in the area , let 's make some phone calls . Sir , this Paul Forrester , I 'm kind of curious , what d 'you want him for ? That 's a government matter . Right , just though I 'd ask . We 're hitting the road . Are you coming ? No . I 'm not . Just go on without me . What about your mum ? We 're some pair ... I just don 't know what to do . I got butterflies in my stomach . You do ? No , it means ... like when you 're really nervous . What if I don 't recognize her ? What if she doesn 't recognize me ? She will . I 'm scared , what if they know who she really is ? Scared ? Frightened ? No , scared , excited . Me too . Thank you kindly . Hello ? Mrs Simpson ? No , I 'm Pat Cole What can I do for you ? We need to talk to Mrs Simpson . Sorry , if you mean Kelly Simpson , the lady who build this place she sold out to my husband and me 'bout four years ago . Where did she go ? I don 't know , son . She 's my mother 's friend , She 'll know where she is ! We gotta find her . I wish I could help you . Did she leave a forwarding address or something ? No , sorry . All we kept was the name of this place . and the records , what there were of them , such a mess ! Just got rid of it all . Scott ! Don 't worry . We 'll keep looking , I promise . Don 't you understand ? Scott ! What am I gonna do now , huh ? This is the only lead I had ! I 'm never gonna find her . I 'm George Fox , Federal Security . Look , look , I tried to stall them like you asked me to , but they took off here a while ago , hell of a hurry . Alright , did the say where they were going ? Yeah , they asked me if I had map to the Spirit Lake area . They went to a place called Simpson 's Lodge . Thank you . Scott ! Beth ! Beth ! Scott ! So , now she 's down the court , taking lessons twice a week , right , I mean , she 's discovered she 's got this wicked back hand . - What was that ? - I don 't know . So , where was I ? Oh yeah , I cannot even believe her , she 's never wanted to go out there before ... I was hoping to make things clear and simple with Beth , instead I just made it worse . You should have trusted her . Give her a chance to trust you . If it could only be that simple . It is ! Trust is doing something somebody asks you to do , even if you think it 's dumb . I don 't understand you , Paul . Scott ? Scott ? Over here ! Where are you ? In here ! Hi . Are you OK ? Sure , I 'm terrific . Hm , when you said you were gonna meet your mum I thought that ... She left so long time ago . She had to . She did for me . I guess if she knew , how things were now , that he 'd come back . She wouldn 't wish for things like that . Wishing is stupid . Like hoping , like trust You just have to learn to take care of yourself , and not care about anybody else . You don 't have to be here , you know ? You can go , I 'll be OK . I owe you one . Eddie , look at that . Wait , wait ! You can 't shoot those ! What ? Are you kidding me ? Oh , I couldn 't have taken it home anyway . My wife loves cats . I wish we could stay in this cave for ever . Sure nobody would miss us . Oh my God ! OK , huh , stay very still . What are we gonna do ? What are you ? Crazy ? You wanna throw a marble at it ? Scott ? Beth ? Oh Beth ! Help us ! Please , help us ! I dropped the sphere , I can 't reach it . You don 't need it . Hold out your hand . What ? - How can I help ? - No ! Don 't move ! Hold out your hand to the animal now . Do it . I can 't I 'm not you . Yes you can , trust me . Now , do it . Did I do that by myself ? Yes . By yourself . You are a part of me , Scott Hayden . I can 't bear the thought of losing you , Beth . Losing me ? I don 't understand . I was just afraid that you wouldn 't wanna be with me . You 've always been in the middle , Beth . Between your father and me . So now what do we do ? We 'll go back . And Daddy ? Honey I can 't do that . But we 'll both me in the same city . I 'm not gonna put you in the middle again . Beth , it 's gonna be rough . Couldn 't be any worse than this weekend , could it ? Well , that was an experience . How did you that in the cave ? My son did it ! I only guided him . You 're some father ! Not yet . Well , this is the time when I usually say , make sure you write . Or I ask for your phone number ... Yeah Too bad you have to go . Or I can still get your phone number . Yeah Hey come on ! Let 's go , Dad ! Hey Scott . What ? You called me Dad . Yeah , well it was only to get your attention . Don 't fall apart . - Bye Scott ! - Good bye , good bye ! You think we will find my mum ? We 'll find her . Trust me . Shannon says I have to put you in school . Oh ! Yeah ...

[ Walter Graham ] Mike . You 're getting ahead of my story . Anyway . You see the point is that I learned about blackmail a long time ago . What I learned was Never put yourself in a position where some idiot can blackmail you . Where someone has power over you . Like being able to make a deal with the FCC . Telling them something they want to know . Turn state 's evidence for a lighter sentence . Hmmm ? Walter . Walter , I wouldn 't do that . I wouldn 't do that ! Oh , please , Walter . Come on , Mike .

I 'm really going to meet Walter Graham . * [ suspenseful music ] [ Walter Graham ] Alright . Thank you . Dammit . The girls are not on board . [ Harvey ] Good . Let 's get the hell outta here before they come back . But you just don 't get it do you ? Don 't you think that two pretty girls on a cruise makes a good cover ? In case somebody should be snooping around . You gotta use your brain , Mike . We need the ... I know what you wanna do in Florida and it has nothing to do with cover . We need the girls on board . [ Harvey ] Young broads are a pain in the ass . Old broads are a pain in the ass . [ Laughter ] - * [ upbeat music ] - [ Corey ] You don 't know who Walter Graham is ? [ Martin ] Well , sure I 've heard of him . So he 's made a lot of money . I mean so what . So what ? This guy is has been on the cover of Forbes magazine twice . [ Bobbie ] He 's just a man .

[ Gagging sound ] [ Boat motor ] * [ dramatic music ] So , how is my captain this morning ? I 'd be a lot better if we hadn 't lost an entire crew . You mean you still haven 't replaced them ? [ Rachel ] Walter , do you know what time it is ? Besides , if you didn 't treat them like slaves we wouldn 't have to replace them . [ Walter Graham ] Okay . So I got a little drunk and mouthed off to the crew . I apologize . But it is my boat . So it is . And if you don 't like that , honey , you are free to leave anytime . [ Rachel ] And let you ruin it before I have a chance to get it back . [ Snickering ] Your old man couldn 't make a go of this boat . What makes you think you can ? - Leave my father out of this . - [ Walter Graham ] Rachel . If you really want the damn boat back , all you have to do is ask . I can be a very generous man with people Who just treat me right . Walter , you pay me to run this boat . Nothing else . [ Sighing ] Well , think about it . Okay . Just think about it . Don 't count on it . [ Walter Graham ] What 's going on here , Mike ? Mr. Graham , I was just telling your associate here that I 'm a great admirer of yours . - [ Corey ] You are the greatest . - [ laughs ] Well , thank you . But I 'm sorry . You 're going to have to leave anyway . And how appropriate . Here comes the shuttle right now . Graham ! [ Albert ] Graham ! [ Footsteps on metal ladder ] Graham ! Graham ! Albert . What is it ? The FCC ... uh . I just got word the FCC has got a warrant to search your boat . We 've got to get out of here now . I 'm afraid we have had a change in plans and we will be leaving immediately . So , uh , I 'm sorry But you 're all are going to have to go back on the pier in that shuttle boat . Captain ! Take us out to sea . Right now , please . Without a crew ? You must be joking . You guys still want to go on this cruise or not ? I 'll do anything . I just don 't want to barf again . Look , Walter . You got three able body men here plus Suzanne and I can help . That 's crewman you don 't even have to pay . Besides , we 'll all have some fun . What do you say ? Albert . Take these three sailors and raise the anchor and bring up the gangplank . Mike . Start the engine . Alright , everybody . Come on let 's move it . Suzanne . That cat goes back with the shuttle boat . No . It 's mine . You know I heard a cat aboard a ship is supposed to be good luck , Mr. Graham . Listen , kid . If you really want to go on this cruise with the rest of us . The first thing you got to learn is that this is my yacht . That means I am in charge . And I don 't like cats . So the cat goes . Sorry , Suzanne . Oh , please , Walter . I promise this darling little kitty won 't be any trouble . Pleeease . I 'll take care of it . You won 't be sorry . I promise . Okay . Keep the damn thing . But you owe me one , Suzanne . And I never forget that . [ Laughter ] [ Sounds of seagulls ] [ Corey ] Check this place out ! Whoa ho ! Must of been some great party , huh ? [ Laughter ] - It was . - [ meowing ] [ Kissing ] [ meowing continues ] How you doing now ? Better ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Corey was right being on a boat this big . I 'm okay . I told you no one gets sick on yachts . Ah . Gross ! What a mess . Yeah , the hell with the mess . You know that somebody Could actually live on this boat permanent like . Yeah , well . Mr. Graham loves to party . Well then it can 't be all bad , huh ? [ Laughs ] * [ upbeat music turned on radio ] * Here pussy , have some food . [ Laughter ] - [ meowing ] - Ahh ! Hey ! Hey !

Evens out the pain . So you smile ... * Damn , I feel sorry for the sucker that has to clean this place up . Ah . Ha ! [ Walter Graham ] Self pity is not a good habit to get in , gentleman . We had a deal about crewing this boat remember ? Sure thing , Mr. Graham . We were just a little hungry . I don 't like you . I don 't like punk kids who think the world owes them a living . [ Harvey ] What that means for you is that despite what duties the captain may have for you . I 'm assigning some specific duties right now . You 're the cook . You 're the busboy and the dishwasher . You 're the maid . [ Snickering ] Yeah well you can go take a flying ... Whoa . Whoa . Just a minute there . Now he 's right . Mr. Graham is the boss . Now who 's side are you on ? Nobody 's side . We have work to do and we 're going to do it , right ? As a matter of fact , we will throw a party tonight in your honor . And Walter just leave all that petty stuff to me . I 'm sure you got much more important matters to attend to . Okay , guys ? We can get this place cleaned up in no time , huh . Now you must be the smart one . The smart ones always know who 's running the show . [ Mike Harvey ] I hate punks like those guys . Mike . The only important thing here . Is that we get this boat To Grand Cayman . And get our money out of that bank Before it really hits the fan . It 's time we throw in our cards . Take our winning And [ snaps fingers ] get the hell out of town . Now if these punks can help us run our boat then we need them . Alright just keep them the hell away from me . Alright . [ Sighs ] Did you put all the cash in the safe ? Yeah . You gotta loosen up a bit man . Do you realize how much money we 're going to be taking out of that bank ? You 're going to be richer than your wildest dreams . - But what if the account is frozen when we get there ? - Stop worrying ! Today is only Friday . We are there first thing Monday morning . We get the cash . Then we go buy a country in South America . Laugh a little . Live a little . You 're a rich man . [ Kissing sound ] Oh . No . * [ suspenseful music ] [ water sounds ] * [ upbeat music ] - * [ suspenseful music ] - [ meowing ] [ Meowing ] [ Meowing ] They are all talking about a storm .

You understand ? - Uh , huh . - And keep your hands off of everything But the wheel alright ? Go ahead . Take the wheel . Alright ? Relax . It 'll be fine . [ Lance ] Great spring break in Lauderdale , huh , Corey ? Yeah , you just wait until I get a chance to talk to Walter Graham . Oh . In the mean time we do the dishes . We came to party . Oh , come on , Lance . For once I agree with Corey . Make the best of it . This isn 't so bad . I mean we are working on a fantastic yacht . We 're sailing the Caribbean . This is how real adventure begins . I feel like Errol Flynn . [ Laughter ] - Hedgeworth . You 're weird . - [ laughter ] I hope one you boys can cook . Because we can 't . Not to worry . I can cook . Oh , great . First we gotta do the dishes and now we gotta eat the Hedgeworth 's cooking ? Well I sure do feel sorry for you boys . Having to work so hard in this very hot kitchen .

[ In unison ] It is so hot ! Maybe I don 't feel so much like Errol Flynn . Maybe more like Woody Allen . I 'll see you guys later . [ Kissing sounds ] [ Albert ] Boy . I gotta tell ya . I believe it will make out like the captain said . Oh , the captain and then she leaves me . All alone here while he goes out and has his fun . Boy , I 've ... Shoot . [ Laughter ] Come here , baby ! Mmmm ! Ahhhh ! Man ! Ahhhh ! [ Coughs ] Mmmm . Albert ! Whoo !

[ Laughter ] [ Corey ] That was a great story ... [ Walter Graham ] The gall of some people . [ Corey ] How much did you end up with ? [ Walter Graham ] Huh ? You tell him , Mike . [ Laughs ] [ Harvey ] We walked but not before we got twenty-five million . [ Laughter ] [ Rachel ] You 're different than your two friends . I guess I am . But they 're okay . Corey is pre-law . Lance is a jock . He 's got a free ride . Wrestling . He 's pretty good . What about yourself ? Me ? I 'm a biologist . [ Martin ] I 'm a year away from my doctorate . [ Meowing ] [ Meowing continues ] And don 't you run away from mama anymore . Now Suzanne you remember our deal . You keep that cat away from me . Or I 'll give it a swimming lesson . Ah .

Why do you prefer the company of this kid to me ? Hm ? Why ? He has brains . [ Walter Graham ] Brains ? What would you know about brains ? You are such a dumb broad ! Hey ! Wait a second . There 's no reason to talk to her like that . [ Rachel ] It 's okay . Martin . He 's just a little drunk . He 's making a joke . Mr. Graham and I are old friends . That 's right . We are old , old , friends . If you two will excuse me , I guess I should relieve Albert from the wheel . But that 's right , you go ahead because you 're sure not doing this party any good . * I 've been thinking about you . * - [ Lance ] Whoo ! Crank it ! - * [ turns music up on radio ] [ Corey ] Babe .

Now that little miss captain is going to want to go back and look for him . Look , I just say we get out of here and we didn 't see anything okay ? Yeah , okay . Of course , nothing is going to keep me from getting to the Caymans . Us ! We are on the same boat together remember . [ Boat rocking on the water ] * Out on the ocean . So what do you think ? - You like Lance . - [ laughs ] Yeah . He 's a real stud . Mmm . What about Corey ? He 's a little preoccupied with money . [ Suzanne ] Don 't you think ? Yeah . Tell me seriously . You wouldn 't like living like this all the time ? Um hmmm . [ Laughter ] I could get used to it . [ Laughs ] [ Sound of engine trying to start ] What happened ? I don 't know exactly . She 's running way too hot . I had to shut her down . For how long ? If I had a half way decent crew , I wouldn 't have to stop here in the first place . I can 't even find that nitwit , Albert . * [ suspenseful music ] [ Meowing ] [ Martin ] I can 't find him . This is what I was afraid of . There was an accident . He must have fallen overboard . Oh , my god . [ Rachel ] I had a feeling this was going to be a bad day . You ain 't handling this right . She ain 't gonna buy it . [ Walter Graham ] Our little lady captain is going to jump at it . Looks like Albert fell overboard last night . What ! Are you sure ? [ Rachel ] We 've looked everywhere . That 's just awful . Well I have to notify the authorities and then we have to go back and look for him . Back track ? ! You gotta be kidding we can 't be going back . Well , I 'm afraid that can 't be helped . Considering the circumstances . [ Walter Graham ] I hadn 't planned on telling you this until we arrived to port . [ Walter Graham ] You see if we make my deadline , Let 's just say I 'll be a very rich man . And among other things , I won 't be needing this boat anymore . Transfer of ownership papers ? In your name . All legit . And at a price that you can manage . That is if you think you can get your charter business going again . I 'm not trading a man 's life for a boat . [ Walter Graham ] That 's very commendable . No matter what you may think of me . I wouldn 't either . Mike . Tell her . Well , yeah , it doesn 't make sense . We can 't be spending all those days with authorities . Wasting their time . Wasting their money . Risking their lives for a body they ain 't gonna find . You can 't be certain of that . Yes , I can . Albert couldn 't swim . - Is that true ? - I 'm afraid so . It 's a shame about Albert . I liked him . Yeah . Well , he 's shark bait now . Alright , make up your mind , Rach . Do you want the yacht or not ? I 'll have to make a record in my log . [ Walter Graham ] Of course , I would expect no less . - Mmm . - [ laughing ] - Ahh ! Whoo ! - That 's right . [ Splashing water ] * [ suspenseful music ] We decided passage into the Cayman Islands . Captain 's decision . Based on ... [ Door opens ] Do you have a sextant ? Yes . Why ? Can I take a look at it ? Okay . But Martin , a sextant is used for navigation . I know , I just want to try it out for something else here . Does this look like it could be Albert 's ? Could be . Why ? * [ suspenseful music ] - Do you have any water ? Any liquid at all ? - Mmm hmm Hold that there . - Like that ? - Yeah . - [ Rachel ] What is it ? - * [ suspenseful music ] Look . [ Rachel ] Martin . What am I looking at ? [ Martin ] Blood cells . This is a hundred , maybe even a thousand times normally for fresh blood . [ Suzanne ] And you think this is Albert 's blood ? Don 't you ? * [ upbeat music ] [ Meowing ] [ Blowing out air ] I think you are better than Jane Fonda . Thanks . You know when I get this tugboat really going . There will be so much money . And mucho good life . It doesn 't look like you 're suffering too bad right now . [ Laughs ] This is nothing . [ Meowing ] You sure are one hell of a good looking woman . Thanks . When I saw you in the spa , with your body shining in the sun , I nearly had to be restrained from leaping over the railing ... I guess that 's a compliment . Your perky little body is . Walter , I 'm trying to work out you know . Well you just forget about that because I 'm getting real tired of you girls leading me on . [ Walter Graham ] For now on you are going to play it my way Or the game is over and you get out . Oh , Walter . We are miles out to sea . Now how am I gonna get out ? We 've got a life boat . [ Laughs ] You wouldn 't dare ! You wanna bet ? [ Laughs ] Walter , now don 't be stupid . [ Cat screams ] Hey ! What the hell you doing ? Hey just get lost kid . This is none of your business . Leave her alone ! [ Crashing glass ] [ meowing ] - Stop it ! - Ow ! [ Gunfire ] [ screams ] What the hell is going on , Walt ? Dumb kid jumped me when I wasn 't looking . Oh yeah ? No you can 't ! Just watch me ... - Mike . Wait . Hold it ! ... - Nooo ! Stop . [ Walter Graham ] Hold it ! [ Lance ] Corey ! [ Screams ] Ugh ! Oh ! Oh ! [ Bobbie cries ] [ Screams ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Oh . Oh . [ Gunfire ] Oh god . Oh , my god . We gotta stop the bleeding . I 'll get the first aid kit . What happened ? Mike , what happened ? Uh . Uh . The cat . The cat . Ugh ! [ Heavy breathing ] Ugh ! [ Heavy breathing ] His heart is racing a mile a minute . Ugh ! His pulse is going crazy . What happened to him ? He just went nuts . I 've never seen anything like this . This is not like him . The cat couldn 't have done this . Look , it 's right through the shoe . [ Harvey ] It was the cat . It 's crazy . There 's no way the cat could do that . I don 't see how either . [ Martin ] Somebody better get on the radio and get some medical assistance And fast or I 'm gonna lose this guy , huh . Okay just keep that on there alright . Yeah . [ Rachel ] Suzanne , come with me . [ Door closes ] Suzanne , come here . Come here . Hold this button done and call , Mayday , Mayday . I 'm going to find where the nearest medical facility is . Put that thing down . - What are you doing ? - I said put the damn radio down ! Are you crazy ? We had a deal about getting straight to the Caymans , remember ? Those two people might die if we don 't get them to a doctor . The kid 's gonna be alright . Mike is my problem . Now do you want that boat or not ? Not with this much blood on it . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is the Caribbean Sun and we have a medical emergency . I repeat , Mayday ! Mayday ! [ Gunfire ] [ explosion ] Now start the engines and get us heading for the Caymans . I 'm not taking this boat anywhere . I don 't think you 're going to shoot the only person who can operate it . Fine . Then I 'll just blow her head off and everyone else 's on board . One at a time , Until you take me to where I want to go ! You wouldn 't dare . You 're way outta your league , Sweetheart . - [ Suzanne ] Oh , my god . - [ Walter Graham ] This one goes right between her eyes . - [ screams ] - Alright ! Stop it ! I 'll do it . Get this boat moving . Look , I 've told you that the engine is heating up . If it dies , we are dead in the water . And I can 't guarantee I can fix it . You get this thing going right now ! - [ Rachel sighs ] - [ engine cranking ] Cut the crap Rachel and start this thing ! [ Rachel ] What the hell do you think I 'm trying to do . [ Walter Graham ] Just get out of the way ! * [ tense music ] - Stop it ! - [ Walter Graham ] No way ! You just stand back . This thing is gonna start . [ Mini explosion ] [ Walter Graham ] What the hell happened here ? [ Fire extinguisher ] [ Coughing ] [ Walter Graham ] Wait . Wait . Stop . Hold it . Hold it . You can 't let her . I mean uh , Wait a minute . Look , I 'm sorry okay . It 's just that I ... I ... [ Walter Graham ] Wait . Wait . Wait . Stop . Hold it . You can 't let her . I ... I ... I ... Okay I 'm sorry alright ! It 's just that I ... Yeah , you 're sorry . Yeah , you 'll get your chance . Keep the gun on the scumbag . [ Rachel ] But if he moves , blow his balls off ! - * [ dramatic music ] - [ Mike moaning ] As near as I can tell , the cat that bite Mr. Harvey is highly poisonous . A poisonous cat ? Now how is that possible ? I found a piece of bloodstained shirt this morning . Rachel and I took a pretty good look at the blood . And it was mutating like nothing I have ever seen or heard about before . [ Moaning ] - [ Corey ] Maybe the cat 's got rabies . - [ Mike ] Oh god . No . I 've seen rabies . I know what it does to the blood . This was a mutation . [ Martin ] It 's definitely not rabies . [ Daryl ] Bob ... Bobbie said she saw the cat running through the hall . Tell Martin what you told me . Well it all happened really fast . I don 't know it didn 't look like the cat . But it had to be . I don 't know . His face was distorted or something . I don 't know . I mean , it sounds crazy . I don 't know . Did it look like a normal cat to you before , Suzanne ? Of course . It 's just a cat . Oh ... god ! Martin . Could this have anything to do with that laboratory tag that cat was wearing ? What are you talking about ? Shut up , Graham ! You know you have been a major disappointment to me . [ Martin ] Suzanne maybe on to something . There 's a great deal of experimentation on lab animals . Maybe somehow this cat 's system got some type of experimental chemicals in it . [ Heavy breathing ] [ rapid heartbeat ] [ Martin ] I don 't know . It seems to me that our cat Might administer that very same kind of chemical when it bites . Now if they were giving it some type of metabolic steroid . That might explain the strength to bite through the shoe . You mean they actually poisoned that poor cat and now it 's dangerous to all of us . All I know for sure is , that the blood cells in Mike 's body Are multiplying at a phenomenal rate . Somehow he has been poisoned . You got some of Mike 's blood on your hands . How come you 're not sick ? [ Sighs ] Most likely it can only be transmitted by actual contact with my blood by ingesting it . [ Martin ] Just touching it or getting it on my skin shouldn 't hurt me . [ Moaning and groaning ] - Oh , god . - [ rapid heartbeat ] Oh , god . [ Moaning ] * [ intense music ] - Oh , god . - [ rapid heartbeat ] * [ intense music swells and stops ] * [ Big splash ] What 's going to happen to us ? [ Martin ] We 're gonna survive . We 're going to get this boat started and we 're going to survive . - [ Walter Graham ] Is this really necessary ? - [ Corey ] Shut up . Now , I can 't believe you shot up that radio . You know you 're real lucky that they won 't let me blow your head off . You wouldn 't have the guts to shoot me even if they did let you , preppy . Rachel , I still gotta get to the Cayman Islands . That 's the least of our problems . Let 's go . [ Door closed and locked ] * [ suspenseful music ] How are you feeling ? I 'm okay . Really . - [ creaking sound ] - What was that in the closet ? - Probably just a boat creak . - How do you know ? I mean what if it 's the cat ? - Don 't worry . I 'll go check , okay . - No . You stay here . I 'll do it . You sure ? Yeah . * [ suspenseful music ] You ready ? * [ suspenseful music swells ] * [ suspenseful music stops ] [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] [ Rachel ] It was just me and my father after that . The ship was his dream for both of us . Then we had some storm damage and dad got sick . We got behind on our payments from the bank . Graham owns the boat now . So if I 'm ever going to get this boat back , I need to get this damn engine fixed . - You see this pump here ? - Yeah . It uh , brings sea water in to cool the engine . I gotta trace every hose and electrical wire . Uh , give me a hand . Alright . You got a lot of nice stuff here for a creep , Graham . That 's what happens when you got money , preppy ! Yeah , ain 't that the truth . And you don 't know the half of it . [ Corey ] Uh , uh , uh . You like that ? [ Corey ] You kidding me ? I always wanted one of these . - Keep it . - [ Corey ] What ? What are you deaf as well as dumb ? Go ahead . Take it . I have a drawer full of ' em . I guess you really are a rich S.O.B. , aren 't you ? And getting richer all the time . Here let me show you ... Whoa ! Not so fast . Hey ! Take it easy , man . I 'm just going to get something out of the wall safe . Okay . Nice and slow . [ Sound of safe lock turning ] [ Safe creaking open ] There . You can open it . Be my guest . Go ahead . But do it nice and slow so I can see everything . [ Walter Graham ] Very well . Feast your eyes . - How much is that ? - [ Walter Graham ] One million American dollars . - Cash . - [ flipping money ] Buy a lot of watches . Well , opportunity is knocking . Wake up . Take a bundle . There 's plenty more where that came from . Oh , yeah ? How much more ? You help me get to my bank in the Cayman Islands without anymore hassles . [ Walter Graham ] And you will be using that as pocket change . - You know somehow I don 't trust you , Mr. Graham . - [ Graham laughs ] I would be disappointed if you did . But try son . [ Gears shifting ] * [ suspenseful music ] Rachel . - [ Rachel ] So . - [ Martin ] So ? It means that any food the cat comes into contact with becomes contaminated . Yeah but the food 's all locked up right ? Yes . It 's safe . The cat 's going to get awful hungry . What are you trying to say Martin ? [ Martin ] I 'm just saying that we got to stay alert . * [ dramatic music ] [ Suzanne ] Mmmm ! [ Voice ] Meow ! Meow ! [ Breathing heavy ] [ Suzanne ] No . Go away , please . Ain 't nothing here but us killer pussy cats ! You almost scared me to death ! Come on . What are you scared of a little cat ? You 're damn right I am . If you were smart , you would be too . You want me to stay here and protect you from the big , bad boogie man ? Matter fact , uh , I would feel better with a big , strong man here to protect me . [ Sniffs ] You know what ? I 'm going to do whatever it takes to keep him here . * [ romantic music ] [ Kissing sounds ] [ Moans ] [ Kissing sounds ] Listen , if you really want to be protected , You 're going to be smart to stick by me no matter what happens . Why do you think I picked you from the beginning ? It 's obvious we were meant for each other . That is right . We are going places . I got it all worked out . Once we get off this boat , things are just going to slide ... [ Kissing sounds ] [ Sigh ] You mean " if " . If we ever get off this boat . We will . If I have to row this damn thing back to shore , I 'm going to make things happen for me . [ Laughs ] [ Moans ] [ Kissing sounds ] * [ dramatic music ] [ Martin ] Two days stranded . Dammit , you 'd think we would find something out here . Okay . Let 's give it a try . See what we got . [ Cranking of an engine ] [ Cranking of an engine ] Dammit ! I just don 't have the parts . I just can 't keep ... You 're doing the best you can . I never should have left port . You know listening to Graham was the stupidest thing I ... Nobody 's blaming you . * [ light music ] You just gotta keep trying . Alright , Martin . I 'll be alright . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Sounds of wind and ocean ] - I thought it was going to start this time . - Yeah . Me too . [ Sigh ] So how 's your shoulder ? Better . Really . Except for the damndest thing , lost all the feeling in my arm . Doesn 't hurt . Nothing . No feeling at all . [ Lance ] Kinda tingles you know like when your arm falls asleep . Uh huh . Well , I know something that will help . - [ Lance ] Yeah . - [ Bobbie ] Uh huh . This is just what the doctor ordered . * [ romantic music ] [ Kissing sounds ] - [ laughs ] - [ Bobbie ] What is it ? I was just thinking . You know I lost the feeling in my arm doesn 't seem to affect other parts of my body . [ Laughs ] Yeah . Let me take a look at that boo boo . * [ dramatic music ] [ Screams ] [ Indistinct screams ] No . No . - [ Bobbie ] Wait ! - No . You heard what Martin said , I 'm poison . - [ Bobbie screaming ] - No . You heard what Martin said , I 'm poison . I 'm already dead . [ Bobbie ] Did you see that thing ! Did you see it ? Did you see that thing ! Did you see it ? It poisoned my blood ! Wait ! Lance . It 's okay . [ Lance ] I got the poison in my blood ! Please don 't ! [ Screams ] - [ Corey ] No . Wait ! - [ Bobbie ] Don 't go ! - I got the poison in my blood ! - [ Bobbie ] Don 't please ! Lance ! No wait ! [ Screams ] [ Splash of water ] [ Corey ] Lance ! [ Martin ] I 'm going in too . [ Splash of water ] Can you see them ? * [ dramatic music ] [ Crackling of fire ] [ Rachel ] Here . [ Martin ] Dammit . I can 't believe what happened . It 's just not real . He was yelling about having poison in his blood . - There 's no more fresh water . How ' bout some champagne ? - [ Corey ] Yeah . Save that . We 've got to tighten up on supplies . We 're all going to die out here . I mean let 's face it . We 're all going to die on this stupid boat . [ Martin ] Easy Suzanne . We 're not going to die . We 're going to survive . [ Rachel ] He 's right Suzanne . We 're going to make it . We 'll have that engine fixed in no time . Right Martin ? That 's right . We 've almost got it . [ Martin ] If we give up now , we might as well just lie down and die . [ Martin ] We 're going to get out of here if we just keep on fighting . You 're lying . You 're both lying ! We 're never going to get out of this alive . We 're all going to die . [ Crying ] That thing 's going to bite us . And we all are going to die a horrible death . [ Cries ] [ Crashing waves ] [ Martin ] Any luck ? [ Corey ] No . Look , we need to let Walter Graham out . Never . [ Corey ] Look , we don 't have much of a choice . We need his help . Now what kind of help can he give us ? [ Corey ] He can give us plenty of help . Look , when you two are fixing the motor , we can form a counter assault team . You don 't know Walter Graham like I do . And I don 't like the idea of letting him out . No Corey is right . We are running out of time here . We can 't afford to have anybody not pulling his weight . He and Graham can look for the cat and you and I can work on the boat around the clock . - We can have Suzanne keep watch . - Right . How 's that sound ? [ Keys jingling ] - Alright , then . It 's settled . - [ keys jingling ] Get away from me . I 'm not helping you with anything . You will take watch like you 're told . - No . - Listen you bitch ! If you hadn 't brought that cat ... [ Martin ] Corey ! Hold on . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You want to get off this boat don 't you Suzanne ? - Yes . - We all do . Now we are going to . Everybody 's gotta help . Gotta do their job . You can understand that . Now we need you to keep a watch out for planes and ships . Okay ? You said it was good luck to bring a cat on board . That 's right . I did . And it 's your fault the cat 's here not mine . You 're right . You 're right . But I still need you to stand watch . Okay . [ Suzanne ] But I want Corey to know who 's at fault here . It 's okay . Corey knows . Don 't you Corey ? Yeah . Now come on and take the damn binoculars . I 'm going to go get Graham . - [ Martin ] Hey , Corey ! - Yeah . - [ Martin ] Be careful . - Yeah . Don 't worry about Walter , I can handle him . I meant the cat . [ Corey ] Don 't worry . I have it all figured out , Mr. Graham . [ Walter Graham ] Yeah . There 's still a chance I can get to my bank on time . Listen , that thing can jump out from anywhere . Let me have the gun . Look son , do you trust me ? Don 't you ? Let me have the gun . Yeah . I trust you , Mr. Graham . Let 's nail this cat and I got some ideas . Yeah . This looks like a prime spot . Yeah . Put these babies in the right places and our little friend is history . [ Walter Graham ] Just the smell of that stuff is making me salivate . [ Corey ] If you knew how much poison I put in it , you 'd lose your appetite really quick . [ Corey laughs ] I 'll show Martin that he 's not the only smart one around here . After all ... The hunt is still the hunt . I don 't know Martin . Maybe you are right . [ Rachel ] If I could just hold out , I should be able to get that engine running . Yeah if the food will last that long . Here 's your turn to serve dinner . Cereal again ! Um . Mmm . Will you be joining us ? No . I have a previous engagement to become a master mechanic . Well maybe I can interest you in a midnight snack . [ Kissing ] [ Corn Flakes hitting dish ] [ Corn Flakes hitting dish ] That 's it ? What kind of food is this ? - Where 's Corey ? - He 's out checking his traps . Oh , I hope he 's caught that thing . I can 't sleep with that cat crawling around . Well here 's to a dead cat . * [ suspenseful music ] [ Corey ] The cat knows the food 's poisoned . [ Cocks gun ] [ Screams ] [ Gunfire ] [ Explosion ] [ Screams ] [ Moaning ] [ Splash in water ] [ Squeaking ] What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Something I should have done days ago . You won 't last two days in that life boat . Our only chance is to stay on this ship and get it going . And maybe someone will spot us . [ Fist pounding wall ] * [ dramatic piano music ] How the hell that thing get in here ? It 's lined with metal . I don 't know . How 'd you let that happen ? You were supposed to be in charge of the food . We didn 't let anything happen . You 've been sitting around on your ass the whole damn time . We 've been working on the engine , the food and everything . [ Martin ] I assume it pried through the sheet metal by itself with its own paws . Oh , god who cares . [ Sighs ] Now we don 't have any food left . Cat should be satisfied now with the contaminated food and water . Shouldn 't be . He 's in a lot better shape than we are . We 're all going to die anyways . * [ tense music ] - [ Martin ] What the hell you doing ... - [ screams ] I 'm looking for something to eat . I 'm starving to death . - Suzanne . Everything in here is contaminated . - [ Suzanne cries ] What you say ? I don 't believe you . You and Rachel are just hoarding it all for yourselves . Don 't be ridiculous . Suzanne you 're going to have to pull yourself together . This food is poisonous . Poisonous ! Do you understand me ? [ Martin ] Everybody 's getting the same share of food . - [ door closes ] - [ Martin ] That 's just the way it is . I 'm sorry , Suzanne . [ Screams ] Okay . I 'm going to the wheel . I 'm going to hit the ignition switch . When I do , just Pull that lever to left . Okay ? Okay . What are you doing sleeping ! What . What ! You 're sleeping ! You 're supposed to be keeping your eyes open . - Ohh . Ahh . - And what the hell are you doing ? Drop dead . I guess I should have known better . Rachel . If you haven 't noticed . It 's all over . It doesn 't matter anymore . Nothing matters . Well you two may be ready to give up but I 'm not . Well at least you 're being consistent for being a dumb bitch ! You know all you had to do to get this boat back was to be nice to me . You 're not even smart enough to do that . And now you 're too dumb to know when to quit . Just like your daddy . [ Slap sound ] [ Indistinct ] I own this boat because I 'm smart and your daddy was dumb like you . Yeah , well you 're an idiot Walter and you always were . And you two can just stay out here and die but not me ! [ Suzanne laughter ] What are you laughing at ? You 're gonna die . [ Laughs ] * [ suspenseful music ] [ Keys jingling ] I knew it ! [ Indistinct singing ] Keeping all this food just for themselves ! [ Meowing ] Don 't ! Get away from me ! [ Meowing ] [ indistinct rambling ] [ Meowing ] You 're not going to hurt me . You 're a sweet little ... [ Choking ] [ Meowing ] * [ tense music swelling ] [ Screams ] [ meowing ] [ Coughing ] [ moaning ] [ Meowing ] [ Thunder ] What are we going to do ? You gotta fix that . It depends on the storm . [ Walter ] Well , you gotta do something . It 's not gonna stop in two minutes . [ Thunder ] [ Rachel ] We have to hurry . We 're taking in too much water . Where 's Graham ? [ Martin ] I don 't know . [ Rachel ] Come on , Graham . [ Walter ] I 've got one more briefcase . I 'll be right back . [ Martin ] We don 't have time . Forget it . We don 't have time . [ Indistinct arguing ] [ Walter ] Wait for me ! [ Meowing ] [ Meowing continues ] [ Screeching ] * [ tense music swells ] - [ Martin ] Where 's Graham ? - [ Rachel ] I don 't know . Forget about him . - [ Martin ] I 'm going for him . You take it down . - [ Rachel ] Not without you . [ Martin ] You gotta do it . Do it yourself . I 'll jump in ... * [ dramatic music ] [ Rachel ] Jump . Jump . * [ dramatic music ] [ Martin ] Come on . We gotta move . She 's going down . * [ dramatic music swelling ] [ Thunder ] I 'm sorry , Rachel . Graham ? No . I wanna know what was so important in this damn briefcase that he gave his life for it . There must be a million dollars in there . Enough to buy a new boat . - And enough to finance the study of biology ! - Yeah ! [ Screams ] - [ Rachel ] Did it bite you ? - [ Martin ] No . Thank god . I think I 'm okay . Oh , Rachel . It 's not over yet . [ Screams ] It won 't leave us alone as long as we are the only floating objects . What do we do ? Here . Maybe we can get to the other side ... No wait a minute . Put it in here . Come on ! It 's getting on . - [ screams of excitement ] - [ Martin ] Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! * [ relaxed music ] Sorry to keep you waiting . But understandably due to the storm , Communications are backed up . Now as to your story about the monster , poisonous cat . I 'm afraid your ordeal must have been too much for you . Right now you need rest and relaxation . If there is any assistance I can be for you . [ Caribbean officer ] Contacting family ? Or friends ? Oh , well ! You 've been so kind . - [ laughter ] - We really don 't know how to thank you . It is my pleasure to help you . Thank you very much once again . You 've been more help than you 'll ever begin to know . - Thank you . - * [ upbeat music ] [ Seagulls ] [ Meowing ] * [ suspenseful music ] [ Boy ] Here kitty , kitty . Here kitty , kitty . Come here . * [ suspenseful music ] * [ dramatic music ] * [ Multicom Entertainment Group jingle ] *

 Bizarro ? Superboy , are you okay ? The green rock , take it . Get it away from me . Lead shield . This must be Kryptonite . Right , lead , alright . That is Lana 's car . Where is she ? He took her . Bizarro took Lana . What 's a bizzaro ? My twin as powerful as me in every way , except Bizarro 's defective , illogical , and he loves Lana . Where do you think he took her ? Anywhere . By now he could be anywhere . This nice house , many rooms to live in . Please take me back , I 've got to get back , I 've got to help Superboy ! Why ? Why , Lana not happy to be with me ? This our place . There 's no place like home . How many times do I have to tell you ? Superboy 's in trouble . You do understand english , yes ? English , me understand . It Lana , Bizzaro can 't figure out . Don 't be sad . Music , it cheer you up . You like . Door is shut tight , we not be disturbed . Disturbed , right . We wouldn 't want that , would we . [ radio ] Police still have no leads on the whereabouts of the creature that abducted a college student earlier this afternoon . Police have confirmed that Superboy suffered no permanent damage from his exposure to the Kryptonite rock . You am sad ? What you call this ? Haven 't you ever seen a tear before ? Where it go ? Who are you ? Me are Bizzaro . I mean , where did you come from ? Me just am . I hope we 're not wasting our time . Ah , I 'm afraid using real Kryptonite on Bizzaro was a waste of time . We 've got to remember he 's a defective version of you , so it makes sense that only a defective Kryptonite can harm him . Now the logic is simple , what 's not so simple is re-calibrating the duplication ray . Well , how long will that take ? Days . We don 't have days . These duplicates are unstable . They 're like walking timebombs waiting to explode . I 'm working as fast as I can . Well , tell me what needs to do done , I 'll do it faster . You no eat ? You not hungry ? This isn 't food , it 's plastic . This one fine . Um ... good . Bizzaro , how much longer are you going to keep me here ? I told you . This our house , we live here forever . We love each other for worse or better . You like dance with me ? No , I don 't want to dance with you , I just want you to let me go ! Why you not want to dance with me ? 'Cause me not look like Superboy ? 'Cause me look ugly ? I don 't think you 're ugly . Why you not dance with me ? Me know why , because me not now how to cry , me not human . Our men are set . I say we go in . I want to hold back . We 're still trying to get word to Superboy . I say we go in now . That girl 's life could be in danger . I 'm the commanding officer here . I think every second counts . Alright , it 's your move . This is the Police Department , you are to surrender . Come out with your hands over your head . Who are they ? Those are the police . They have to hurt you ? No , no , they 've come to help ! If you do as they say ! You have 20 seconds to come out and surrender , or we 'll come inside . This our home , they not welcome . You be safe , here . No , Bizarro , you don 't understand ! Come out and surrender . Bizzaro make bad people go away . No ! Bizarro , let me out of here ! Freeze ! Where you are or we 'll fire ! People not welcome , you leave now . Get out of there ! Hold your fire , men ! We need reinforcements immediately . Nothing has stopped him . We 've got to get hold of Superboy . We need Superboy . [ phone rings ] Professor Peterson here . Yes , he is . I 'll tell him . They 've located Bizzaro and Lana . The police have them surrounded , but he has done some damage . Where ? The furniture store on Jefferson . I 've got to get there . Remember , he is as powerful as you . He 's also a part of me . And I feel he senses the connection too . If I can get to that flawed mind of his I think I can reason with him . You can 't hurt my friend Lana . Look , it 's Superboy , he 's here . Is the hostage alright ? As far as we know , that thing won 't let us near the store . Bizzaro . Why you come here , Superboy ? You must let Lana go . No . Lana love me . She not love Superboy . In a strange kind of way , Bizzaro , you are me , and I am you . I not understand . It 's not easy to explain . You 're on alter duplicate of me . That 's why we 're twins . Brothers . We no look the same . We no sound the same . We have the same powers , we share the same memories . That am true . Still there am something different between me and you something you not telling . You were created from artifical matter . When a bolt of lightening hit the duplicating machine that was aimed at me . What all that mean ? Where you come from is not important I 'm your friend . What all that mean ? You 're not alive , Bizarro . You 're not living . No , me not believe you , you try to trick Bizarro . Okay , men , take up your positions , ready weapons . What are you doing ? Me protect you . Hold your fire or you 'll hit the girl ! Me protect you , not let anyone hurt Lana . Bizarro , do not run from me . We not brothers , you are my enemy . This nice place for Bizarro . Hello . Look them just like me . This must be home . Yeah , how you doing ? This has to stop Bizarro . You no learn , no learn to stay away . No , you don 't learn , Bizarro . Me don 't want to hurt you . Just want be to left alone . Lana , are you alright ? Yeah . Now , Bizarro really mad . Superboy . You come with me . Superboy , I 've got the Bizarro Kryptonite . And not a second too soon . He 's starting to self-destruct , we 've got to hurry . Bizarro , What 's wrong ? Me not feel right . He 's becoming very unstable . He could explode any minute . Bizarro , you must let Lana go . You 're going to hurt her . No , me love Lana , not let go . The Kryptonite isn 't working , somethings wrong . Me feel better now . The Bizarro Kryptonite 's making you feel better ? Of course , how could I not see . It has an opposite effect on him . Instead of hurting him , it 's curing him . Lana not love me . Lana love Superboy . Me feel something strange . You have a tear . Now me know what love feels like it hurts . Sometimes it does . Me am human . Me will never hurt anyone ever . I believe you . Lana and Superboy belong together . Bizarro know that now . Me go . Bizarro . Me wish me never knew what tear is . Where will you go ? Me will go where me never cry again . Everyone remain calm . Superboy has everything under control . Goodbye , Bizarro . Goodbye , brother . Me have one ? Pretty like you . Thanks . Thank you , Superboy . Thank you for giving Bizarro life .

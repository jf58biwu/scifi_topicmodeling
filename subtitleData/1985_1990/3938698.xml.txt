 Bio readouts are all in the green . Looks like she 's alive . Well , there goes our salvage , guys . How are we today ? Ohh . Terrible . Well , better than yesterday , at least . Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station . Been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're okay . Oh , looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy . Come here . Hey , come here . How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ? Where have you been ? Guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Burke . Carter Burke . I work for the company , but don 't let that fool you . I 'm really an okay guy . I 'm glad to see you 're feeling a little better . They tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon . That 's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep , or something like that . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? Inhalation Therapy , report to - Has no one discussed this with you yet ? No . But , I mean ... I don 't ... recognize this place . No , I know . Uh - Okay . It 's just that , uh , this might be a shock to you . It 's long - How long ? Please . 57 years . What ? That 's the thing . You were out there for 57 years . What happened was you had drifted right through the core systems . And it 's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did . It 's one in a thousand , really . I think you 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . You - You okay ? Uhh - Uuh . You okay ? Oh-h-h . Oh , God . Nurse . Please . God . Someone get in here now . Now . Hold . - Please . Hold on . Kill me . No . Uh . Bad dreams again ? You want something to help you sleep ? No . I 've slept enough . Jonesy . Come here . Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right now . It 's over . Dr Hirsch , 334 . Dr. Hirsch , 334 . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . I 've been running behind all morning . Is there any word about my daughter ? Uh ... I really think we should worry about the hearing now . 'Cause we don 't have a lot of time , okay ? I read your deposition , and it 's great . If you just stick to that , I think we 'll be fine . The thing to remember is , there 're gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there . You 've got feds and Interstellar Commerce Commission , Colonial Administration , insurance company guys - Do you have any news about my daughter ? Well , we did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest . Um - Amanda Ripley-McClaren - married name , I guess - Age 66 . And that was at the time of her death , which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy . She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository , Little Chute , Wisconsin . No children . I checked . I promised her ... that I 'd be home for her birthday . Her 11th birthday . I 'd just like to go , uh - back to this point about the override destruct order . Is it in the file ? I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . Now , how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please ? Now , you freely admit to detonating the engines of , and thereby destroying , an M-class starsreighter , a rather expensive piece of hardware . Forty-two million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account , in that , for reasons unknown , the Nostromo set down on LV-426 , an unsurveyed planet at that time , that it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct by you for reasons unknown . Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down there on company orders to get this thing , which destroyed my crew and your expensive ship . The analysis team , which went over the lifeboat centimetre by centimetre , found no physical evidence of the creature you describe . Good . That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock , like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did I.Q. ' s just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft . It was an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds . A creature that gestates inside a living human host . Yes . These are your words . And has concentrated acid for blood . That 's right . Look . I can see where this is going , but I 'm telling you that those things exist . Thank you , Officer Ripley . That will be all . Please . You 're not listening to me . Kane , the crew member - Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs there . Thousands . Thank you . That will be all . Goddamn it , that 's not all . Because if one of those things gets down here , then that will be all . Then all of this - this bullshit that you think is so important - You can just kiss all of that good-bye . It is the finding of this court of inquiry that ... Warrant Officer E. Ripley , NOC14472 , has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . Now , no criminal charges will be filed against you at this time , and you are released on your own recognizance for a six-month period of psychometric probation , to include monthly review by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . That could have been better . Look , I think the - Ripley ? Van Leuwen . Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . There have been people there for over 20 years , and they never complained about any hostile organism . What do you mean ? What people ? Terraformers . Planet engineers . They go in , set up these big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a Shake ' N Bake colony . How many are there ? How many colonists ? I don 't know - 60 , maybe 70 families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . [ Woman On P.A. , I 'll be down in maintenance , okay ? Al . What ? Hey , Al . What ? Remember you sent some wildcatters out to the middle of nowhere last week , out past the Ilium Range ? Yeah , what ? - One of them 's on the horn , a mom-and-pop survey team . He says he 's onto something . He wants to know if his claim will be honoured . Why wouldn 't his claim be honoured ? Well , because you sent them to that particular middle-of-nowhere on company orders , maybe . I don 't know . Christ . Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says , Go look at a grid reference . We look . They don 't say why , and I don 't ask . I don 't ask , because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here , and the answer is always - Don 't ask . So what do I tell this guy ? Tell him as far as I 'm concerned , if he finds something , it is his . Lydecker ? What ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be on this level . Go on . Get outta here . Do too . You go in places we can 't fit . So ? That 's why I 'm the best . Knock it off . I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again , I 'll tan your hides . Mom , all the kids play - Wait a minute . Annie , come and have a look at this , will ya ? Folks , we have scored big this time . What is it , Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's see if we can 't get a closer look at this thing , maybe through that crack there on the side . Shouldn 't we call in ? - Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . That 's about as close as we can get . Should we take a look inside ? You two stay inside . I mean it . We 'll be right back . Okay . Bye . Huh ? Timmy , they 've been gone a long time . It 'll be okay , Newt . Dad knows what he 's doing . Mayday , Mayday . This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling . This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner . Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling . Hiya , Ripley . This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps - Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me at the wolves , and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . Can I finish ? No . There 's no way . Ripley , you wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I can guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . Lieutenant , am I right ? - That 's true . We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . Then you don 't need me . I 'm not a soldier . Yeah , but we don 't know exactly what 's going on out there . It may just be a downed transmitter , okay ? But if it 's not , I would like you there as an adviser , and that 's all . What 's your interest in all this ? Why are you going ? Corporation cofinanced that colony , along with Colonial Administration . We 're getting into a lot of terraforming now . Building Better Worlds - Yeah , yeah . I saw the commercial . Look , I don 't have time for this . I 've got to get to work . Oh , right . I heard you 're working the cargo docks . That 's right . Running loaders and forklifts , that sort of thing ? Yeah . So ? Nothing . I think it 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing that you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . Yeah , if you go . Come on . That 's a second chance , kiddo . I think , personally , for you , it would be the best thing in the world to get out there and face this thing , get back on the horse . Spare me , Burke . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . Yeah , I know . I 've read it . You wake up every night . Your sheets are soaking with sweat - I said no , and I mean it . Now , please leave . I am not going back . And I am - I would not be any good to you if I did . Okay . Shh . Would you do me a favour ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . Oh . Hello . Ripley . You okay ? Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study , not to bring back , but to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right . I 'm in . I think that - And you , you little shithead , you 're staying here . Mmm . They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? Is that a joke ? Oh , I wish it were . Hey , Hicks . Man , you look just like I feel . All right , sweethearts . What are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm - every meal 's a banquet , every paycheck a fortune , every formation a parade . I love the corps . Christ . Man , this floor is freezing . What do you want me to do ? Fetch your slippers for ya ? Gee , would you , sir ? I 'd like that . Look into my eye . Fall in , people . Come on . Let 's go . I hate this job . Crowe , Wierzbowski . Come on . On your feet . We got some slack coming , right ? You had three weeks on your back , Frost . What do you want ? I 'm talking about breathing , not this frozen shit . Yeah , Top . How ' bout it ? All right . First assembly 's in 15 , people . Shag it . Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . Apparently , she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fuckin ' - do . Hey , I 'm impressed . iQue bonita . Hey , Vasquez . Have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? Ha , ha . Oh , Vasquez . You 're just too bad . Uhh . Hey , Top , what 's the op ? It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity . Dumb-ass colonists . What 's this crap supposed to be ? Vasquez . Corn bread , I think . It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . Hey , sure wouldn 't mind getting some more of that Arcturian poontang . Remember that time ? - Yeah . Except the one that you had was male . Doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian . Hey , Bishop , man . Do the thing with the knife . Oh , please . Oh , come on . Yeah . All right . Yeah . I don 't want to see that , man . - Come on , man . All right . All right . Hey , what are you doing , man ? What are you doing ? Come on . Quit messing around , Drake . Hudson , shut up . Bishop , hey , man . Do it , Bishop . Hey . Not me , man . Quit messing around . Yeah , you . Don 't move . Trust me . Aah . All right . Knock it off , knock it off . Thank you . There you go , short shit . Enjoy your meal . That wasn 't funny , man . Lieutenant Gorman ? Mr. Burke ? Yeah , thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . Boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . Thought you never miss , Bishop . You never said anything about an android being on board . Why not ? It never - never occurred to me . It 's just common practice . We always have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term artificial person myself . Right . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't even - Ripley 's last trip out , the syn - the artificial person malfunctioned . Malfunctioned ? - There were problems and a few deaths were involved . I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? The Hyperdyne Systems 1 20-A2 . That explains it then . The A2s always were a bit twitchy . That could never happen now with our behavioural inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm , or by omission of action , allow to be harmed , a human being . You sure you don 't want some ? You just stay away from me , Bishop . You got that straight ? Guess she don 't like the corn bread , either . Squad , ten-hut . Officer on deck . As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right . Listen up . Morning , marines. I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you people before we left Gateway - Sir ? What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . What 's the question ? Is this gonna be a stand-up fight , sir , or another bug hunt ? All we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved . Excuse me , sir . A what ? A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . What exactly are we dealing with here ? Ripley . I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . One of our crew members was brought back on board with something attached to his face , some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off . It wouldn 't come off . Later , it seemed to come off by itselfand die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner , and , um , it must have laid something inside his throat , some sort of embryo . He started - Um , he - Look , man . I only need to know one thing - where they are . Yo , Vasquez . Kick ass . Anytime , anywhere . Right , right . Somebody said alien . She thought they said illegal alien and signed up . Fuck you , man . Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Yeah , okay , right . Thank you , Ripley . We also have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . And if the colonists have found that ship , then there 's no telling how many of them have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so you better look at it . Any questions ? What is it , Private ? How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth and by the numbers . I want D.C.S. and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . Ordinance loading , weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours . Oh , come on . Now , move it , people . All right , sweethearts . You heard the man , and you know the drill . Assholes and elbows . Hudson , come here . Come here . I don 't care if you are short , Hudson . Get it done . Hey , Sarge . You 'll get lip cancer smoking those . Corporal , I want this loading lock sealed . Now . How many more you got , Spunkmeyer ? Last one . Good . Take it away . Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Let me see that . Hi . I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here . Is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class 2 rating . Be my guest . Where you want it ? Bay 12 , please . All right , sweethearts . We 're a team , and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we gonna conquer , and we gonna kick some . Is that understood ? That 's what we gonna do , sweethearts . Yes , sir . We are going to go and get some . Hey . All right , people . On the ready line . Are you lean ? Are you mean ? Yeah . Yeah . What are you ? What are you ? Lean and mean . Hudson . Get on the ready line , marine . Get some today . Get on the ready line . Yo . Move it out . Move it out , goddamn it . Get hot . One , two , three . Get out , get out , get out . Move it out , move it out , move it out . Move it out , move it out , move it out . [ Barking Orders , Absolutely badasses . Let 's pack ' em in . Get in there . All right . Move it . Let 's go , let 's go . One , two , three , four , five , six . All right . I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed . Let 's go . Come on . Settle down , people . Lock ' em in , Hudson . Ready to get it on ? You know it . Okay , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on . Go . Stand by . Cross-locking now . Prelaunch autocycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Shit , man . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by . Ten seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer on my mark . Five , four , three , - We 're on an express elevator to hell , going down . two , one , mark . Woo-hoo . Switch to D.C.S. ranging . 240 , nominal to profile . We 're in the pipe , five by five . We 're picking up some hull ionization . Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? Thirty-eight . Simulated . How many combat drops ? Uh , two ... including this one . Shit . - Oh , man . Range 014 . Turning on final . And I 'm telling you , I got a bad feeling about this drop . You always say that , Frost . You always say , I got a bad feeling about this drop . Okay , okay . When we get back without you , I 'll call your folks . All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody online . Looking good . Drake , check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . - I 'm ready , man . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . Yeah . That 's right . State-of-the-badass art . You do not want to fuck with me . Who here 's runnin ' ? Check it out . Hey , Ripley , don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . Hey . That 's right . Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam phalanx . Fry halfa city with this puppy . We got tactical smart missiles , phase-plasma pulse rifles , R.P.G. ' s . We got sonic , electronic ball breakers . Whoo . We got nukes , we got knives , sharp sticks - Knock it off , Hudson . All right , gear up . Two minutes , people . Get hot . Somebody wake up Hicks . Coming around for a 709er . Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . That 's the atmosphere processor ? Yep , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . You know , we manufacture those , by the way . Okay , Ferro . Take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . All right . Hold at 40 . Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . They still have power . Okay , Ferro . Set down on the landing grid . Immediate dust off on my clear , then stay on station . Down and clear . Ten seconds , people . Look sharp . All right . I want a nice , clean dispersal this time . Let 's go . Move it out . Head ' em up . First squad up on line . Hicks , get yours in accord and watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move . Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . Second squad on line . You set ? Go on . Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . Sir , you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . Uh , we got some explosives damage . It 's probably seismic survey charges . Are you reading this ? Keep it tight , people . All right . Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . Okay . Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . It 's right in there . Now . Now . Haah . Uh - - Good one , Hudson . Uh , sir , uh , we have a negative situation here . Uh , movin ' on , sir Wait . Wait , tell him to - Hicks , back up . Pan right . There . - You seeing this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you like that , you 're gonna love this . Quit screwing around . Second squad , what 's your status ? Uh , we just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , I think we missed it . All right . The area 's secured . Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us . Wait a minute . It 's not secure . The area 's secured , Ripley . First team , head for operations . Hudson , see if you can get their C.P.U. on line . Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . Roger . He 's comin ' in . I feel safer already . Pendejo jerk-off . Sir , we got the C.P.U. on line . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . Okay , let 's go . Are you all right ? Yes . Sir , they sealed off this wing at both ends , welded the doors and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . Mm-hmm . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . Any bodies ? No , sir . Last stand . Must have been a hell of a fight . Yeah , looks that way . All right , Drake , this way . We should be able to cut through the medlab to Operations . Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones that - Careful , Burke . Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . Two are alive . The rest are dead . Surgically removed before embryo implantation . Subject Marachek , John J. , died during the procedure . They killed him taking it off . Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . Behind us . One of us ? Apone , where are your people ? Anybody in D block ? Ah , that 's a negative . We 're all in Operations . Talk to me , Frosty . Let 's keep moving , baby . It 's moving . Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . Fuck . Hold up . Ripley . Hey . Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right . Come on . Just grab her , Corporal . Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . Shh . It 's all right . It 's okay .

Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Easy . Easy . What 's her name again ? Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? Now , look , Rebecca , you have to try and help - Gorman , give it a rest , why don 't you ? Total brain lock . Physically , she 's okay . Borderline malnutrition , but I don 't think there 's any permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . Whoop . That good , huh ? Uh-oh . I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one too . You don 't talk much , do you ? Smoking or non-smoking ? Just tell me what you 're scanning for , Private . P.D.T.s. What ? Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within 20 klicks , we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . I don 't know how you managed to stay alive , but you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . N-Newt . What 'd you say ? - Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt ? I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this , hmm ? Casey . Hello , Casey . What about your brother ? What 's his name ? Timmy . Is Timmy around here too ? Maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and dad ? Newt , look at me . Where are they ? They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . That 's a nice pet you got there , Bishop . Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo . Stop your grinnin and drop your linen . Found ' em . They alive ? Unknown , but it looks like all of them . Over at the processing station , Sublevel 3 , under the main cooling towers . Looks like a goddamn town meeting . Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . All right . Let 's go , people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Let 's go . Head ' em out . Okay , Frost , you 're driving . It 's okay . Don 't worry . It 'll be okay . I want a straight V deployment , second team on left flank . Advance on axial 664 . Tracker on line . Set the V gain to filter R.F. ambient . Hudson , tracker on line . Left and right , little buddy . Forty meters in , bearing 221 , there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . You want Sublevel 3 . Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . Check those corners . Watch your spacing . All right . You heard the man . Don 't bunch up . Stay loose . Uh , your transmission 's showing a lot of breakup . Probably getting some interference from the structure . Use those lights . Next one down , and proceed on a 216 . Uh , roger . That 's a 216 . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me , man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies in here . Easy . Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . Nice and easy . Looks like some sort of secreted resin . Yeah , but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothing . Busy little creatures , huh ? Hot as hell in here . Yeah , man , but it 's a dry heat . Knock it off , Hudson . Lieutenant , what do those pulse rifles fire ? Ten millimetre explosive-tip caseless . Standard light armor-piercing round . Why ? Well , look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So if they fire their weapons in there , won 't they rupture the cooling system ? Ho , ho , ho . Yeah . She 's absolutely right . So ? So what ? Look . This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So you 're talking about a thermonuclear explosion , and adios , muchachos . Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit . Look . Uh ... Apone . Look . We can 't have any firing in there . I , uh , I want you to collect magazines from everybody . Is he fuckin ' crazy ? - What the hell are we supposed to use , man , harsh language ? Flame units only . I want rifles slung . Sir , I - Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . All right , sweethearts . You heard the man . Pull ' em out . Come on . Let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn . You too . Give it up , Ski . Come on . Let 's go . Crowe , I want it now . Give it up . Right on , Vas . Let 's go , marine . Give it up .

Nothing . Zip . Holy shit . Newt , go sit up front . Go on . Now . Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it moving . Easy . Help . - What ? Top , get over here . We got a live one . You 're gonna be all right . Please ... k-kill me . Just stay calm . We 're gonna get you outta here . It 's gonna be all right . Give me a hand . We gotta get her outta here . What is it , Dietrich ? - Convulsion . Dietrich , get back . Get back . No . - Frost , flamethrower . Kill it . Get back . Flamethrower . Move . Movement . What 's the position ? - I can 't lock in . Talk to me , Hudson . Multiple signals . They 're closing . Go to infrared , people . Look sharp . What 's happening , Apone ? Can 't see anything in here . Pull your team out , Gorman . I got signals . I got readings in front and behind . Where , man ? I don 't see shit . He 's right . There 's nothing back here . Look , I 'm telling you . There 's something moving , and it ain 't us . Oh , shit . Tracker 's off scale , man . They 're all around us , man . Jesus . Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . Frost . Come on . Jesus Christ , Apone . What is going on ? Wierzbowski and Crowe are down . Dietrich , Crowe . Sound off . Frost . Dietrich , Frost , off the board . Frost . Wierzbowski ? Wierzbowski ? Let 's rock . Who 's firing ? Goddamn it . Yeah . I ordered to hold fire . They 're coming out of the walls . They 're coming out of the goddamn walls . Let 's book . On the right , man . Uh , Apone , I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators - Vasquez , Drake , hold your fire , goddamn it . Apone , are you copying me ? I want you to lay down suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the A.P.C. Over . Say again , all after incinerator .

 Three million years from Earth , the mining ship Red Dwarf , Its crew ; Dave Lister , the last human being alive ; Arnold Rimmer , a hologram of his dead bunkmate ; and a creature who evolved from the ship 's cat , Message ends , Additional , As the days go by , we face the increasing inevitability that we are alone in a godless , uninhabited , hostile and meaningless universe , Still , you 've got to laugh , haven 't you ? Sit down , Brook , There 's something I must tell you , What is it , Kelly ? I wasn 't with Simone , Brook , I spent the night with Gary , You 're ex-husband ? My business rival ? What are you saying ? ! I 'm saying , Brook Junior ... What about Brook Junior ? He isn 't your android , # Androids # Everybody needs good androids # Androids have feelings , too # Wait a mi nute ! I know this one . Don 't tell me ! " I hope the weather will be clement . " I hope the weather will be clement , Lister , don 't tell me ! I could have got that ! Ah ! I remember this one . " Please direct me to a five-star hotel . " Wrong , actually . Totally , utterly and completely wrong . Please direct me to a five-star hotel , Lister , will you shut up ? - I 'm only helping . - I don 't need help . " I would like to purchase that orange beach ball " and that bucket and spade . " The meal was splendid , Congratulations to the chef , What ? Pause . You 've done Esperanto for eight years . How come you 're so utterly useless ? And how many books have you read in your life ? The same as Champion the Wonder Horse - zero ! - I 've read books . - I don 't mean books about a dog called Ben . - I went to art college ! - How did YOU get into art college ? The usual , boring way you get in . I failed me exams and applied . - They snapped me up . - You didn 't get a degree ... did you ? - No . I wasn 't there long . - How long ? Ninety-seven minutes . I thought it 'd be a good skive . I took one look at the timetable and checked out . It was ridiculous . They had lectures , like , first thing in the afternoon ! We 're talking 12.30 every day ! Who 's together then ? You can still taste the toothpaste . Well , unlike you , Lister , I have ambitions ! I 'm not prepared to sit around polishing my spacebike , so I can go joy-riding , because I 'm not a gimp ! One of my ambitions is to learn another language . Play . Ah , this I do know ... " The menu looks interesting , I 'll try the chicken , " Holly , as the Esperantinos would say ... And I think we know what that means . Yeah , it means , " Get the hall porter , There 's a frog in my bidet , " Well , what 's " Your father was a baboon 's rump , " and your mother was always at it with sailors " ? - I 'm not telling you , - It 's because you 're bored , isn 't it ? - That 's why you 're both annoying me . - I 'm not bored , I 've devised a system to revolutionise music , - Get outta town ! - Yeah , I 've decimalised it , Instead of the octave , it 's the decadive , I 've invented two new notes , H and J , You can 't just i nvent new notes . Well , I have , Now it goes ... # Doh , ray , me , fah , soh , lah , woh , boh , tee , doh # Doh , tee , boh , woh , lah , soh , fah , me , ray , doh # - What are you drivelli ng about ? - " Hol Rock , " It 'll be whole new sound , All the instruments will be bigger , Triangles will have four sides , Piano keyboards the length of zebra crossings , Women will have to be banned from playing the cello , - Holly ... shut up ! - Oh , I haven 't told you the news , - What news ? - A signal , We 're getting a signal , I just thought I 'd mention it , - Aliens . - Oh , God . " Aliens " ! Your explanation for anything slightly peculiar is aliens . You lose your keys - it 's aliens . A picture falls down - it 's aliens . That day we used up a whole bog roll - aliens . We didn 't use it all , Lister . Who did ? Rimmer , aliens used our bog roll ? ! Being aliens doesn 't mean they don 't have to visit the little boys ' room . Although they probably do something weird , like it comes out of their heads . Well , I wouldn 't like to be stuck behind one in a cinema ! Here , mousey , mousey ! I got some cheese ! I only wanna be your friend ! - Yo , Cat ! - Huh ? We 're getting a signal . Come on . Aliens ! It 's a distress call from a ship called the Nova 5 , They 've crash landed , - I 'm trying to establish contact , - Another ship ? Brilliant ! - It 's not aliens ? - No , they 're from Earth , I hope they 've got some spare stuff , We 're short on a few supplies , - Like what ? - Cow 's milk , Ran out of that yonks ago , Fresh and dehydrated , - What ki nd are we usi ng now ? - Emergency supply , Dog 's milk , - Dog 's milk ? ! - Nothing wrong with dog 's milk , Full of goodness , full of vitamins ... full of marrowbone jelly , Lasts longer than any other type of milk , - Why ? - No bugger 'll drink it , Plus , when it goes off , it tastes the same as when it 's fresh , Why didn 't you tell me , Holly ? What ? And spoil your tea ? - Hang about , We 've got contact , - Punch it up . Thank goodness ! My name 's Kryten , I 'm the Nova 5 service mechanoid , We 've had a accident , The male officers died on impact , The female officers are injured , but stable , Please help , Is that female as i n soft and squidgy ? - How many ? - Three , Miss Jane , Miss Tracy and Miss Anne , I 'm transmitting medical details , Tell them we 're coming aboard ! We 'll rescue these fair blooms , or my name 's not Captain A J Rimmer , Space Adventurer ! - Thank you , Captain , - " Space Adventurer " ? ! What do I say ? " Fear not , I 'm the guy who cleans the chicken soup machine ! " We know sod all about space travel , " but if you 've got a blocked nozzle , we 're your lads ! " - That 'll fill them with confidence . - How far away ? - About 24 hours , - What ? Only 24 hours ? I 'd better start gettin ' ready ! # Twenty four hours ... # Aow ! First in the shower room ! I 'm so excited , all six of my nipples are tingling ' ! What 's wrong with him ? We 're on a mission of mercy ! We 're taking them urgent medical supplies . We 're not on the pull . Yo ! No , not on the pull , are we , Lister ? Look at you . Absolutely pathetic ! You 're wearing all your least smeggy things . I don 't know what you mean . That T-shirt with only two curry stains , you only wear on special occasions . You 're toffed up to the nines , laddie ! What about you ? You look like Clive of India , or the one whose mum uses new biological Biz ! Oh , it 's started ! I knew it would ! - What has ? - The put-downs . It 's always the same . Put me down , so you look good . - Like when ? - Those brunettes from Supplies . I said I worked in Stores , and they asked what I did . - And I said you were a shelf ! - Exactly . I suggested a trip to Titan Zoo , and you said , " He 's taking you to meet his mum already ! " - So ? They laughed . - At me . At my expense . - Just don 't put me down . - OK . What do you want me to say ? - For a start , don 't call me Rimmer . - Why not ? You always put the emphasis on " Rim " . Makes me sound like a disinfectant . What should I call you ? Rimere ? I don 't know ... " Arnie " , " Arn " . Something with a bit more ... I don 't know ... How about " Big Man " ? " Big Man " ? - Or my nickname at school ? - " Bonehead " ? - How did you know that ? - I was only guessing . - I meant the other one . - What other one ? " Ace " . Get outta town ! Your nickname was never " Ace " . Maybe " Acehole " . It WAS my nickname at school , actually . It 's just no one ever called me it . What are you saying , Rimmer ? I 'm saying build me up , don 't put me down . Like ... if the opportunity occurs , and it crops up in conversation , you could perhaps mention that I 'm very brave . - Do what ? ! - Don 't go ape . Just sort of mention , perhaps , that ... I died , and that I was pretty incredibly brave about it . Perhaps you could mention that I 've had tons of girlfriends ? Oh , forget it ! It was just an idea . You 're not wearing those boots ? - What 's wrong with them ? - Oh , they just don 't go . You should wear your Day-Glo orange moon boots . - You said they were disgusting . - No , very chic . You said they smelled like an orang-utan 's posing pouch . They set off one of the chemical alarms . You put them in the airlock . No , they look terrific . I 'd wear them . - Honest ? - Definitely . Come along , everybody ! They 're here . They 're in orbit ! Miss Jane ! What about your hair ? What a mess you look . Now , smart but casual . Miss Anne , why , you haven 't touched your soup . No wonder you 're beginning to look so pasty . Oh , no ! Do eat nicely , Miss Anne ! What will the visitors think if they see you eating like that ? Miss Tracey ... No ... You look absolutely perfect . - What 's that smell ? - I can 't smell anything . Your eyes are watering . It 's the excitement . We can 't wait for Cat . Let 's just go . Come on . He 's been preparing for a day . Aow ! Wait for me ! Hi , monkeys ! It 's me , the plastic surgeon 's nightmare ! - A spacesuit with cufflinks ? ! - Where 'd you get the helmet ? I made it . I didn 't want to mess up my hair . Hey , listen - don 't pass any mirrors , 'cause if we do , I 'm there for the day ! Phew ! What 's that smell ? All right ? Everybody ready ? Let 's go , - What are you doing ? - What ? What 's wrong ? - Why are you wearing a toupee ? - What toupee ? - The one on your head . - Whose head ? - You look like a game show host . - What 's wrong with everyone ? Three million years without women and you 're like 14-year-olds ! - What about you and the socks ? - What socks ? - Come on ! - He 's wearing two pairs of socks , - Why ? - One pair on his feet , the other down his trousers , Come in , come in . How lovely to meet you . Charmita ! And what a delightful craft you have . - Reminds me of my first command . - This way , please . Ace . - Hey , you 're a work of art , baby ! - Psst ! You 're gonna have to help me , man ! Thank you ! I 'm so excited ! We all are . The girls could hardly stop jumping up and down ! Ah ! Charmita , charmita ! Ah ! Vi parolas Esperanto , Kapitano Rimmer ? - Come again ? - You speak Esperanto ? Oh ! Si , si , si ! Jahwohl ! Oui ! Well , here they are . Charmita ! Well ... It 's difficult to know what to say ... isn 't it , Ace ? Isn 't anybody going to say hello ? I think the blonde one 's giving you the eye . Well , I 'll leave you to get acquainted . I 'll just go and fix some tea . - Hi , baby ! - I don 't believe this . Be strong , Big Man . Our first contact in three million and two years , and it 's the android Norman Bates . Come on ! So , they 're a little skinny ! Listen , girls . I don 't know whether this is the time , but my mate Ace is incredibly brave . Smeg off , dogfood face . - And he 's got tons of girlfriends ! - I 'm warning you , Lister . Is anything the matter ? Anything the matter ? They 're dead ! Who 's dead ? THEY are dead ! They 're all dead ! My God ! I was only away two minutes ! They 've been dead for centuries ! - No . - Yes ! Are you a doctor ? Look at them ! They 've got less meat on them than a Chicken Nuggett ! What am I going to do ? I 'm programmed to serve them . - I think we should bury them . - You 're that sure they 're dead ? - Yes ! - What about this one ? Er , there 's a simple test . All right , girls , hands up those of you who are alive . What am I going to do ? I can 't leave them ! Mr David , please , please , take me back ! You 've got to start a new life . I haven 't got the software to cope with this . I was created to serve . I serve , therefore I am . It 's my purpose to serve without regard for myself . - You sound like my mum . - It 's all I know . You 've got to change . Do what you want . Stop being everyone 's smeggin ' doormat . That 's easy for you to say , you 're human . Only just . Ah , Kryten ! Nothing to do , eh ? Follow me . What the smegging ' hell is going on ? - Good afternoon , Mr David , sir . - What are these ? - Your boxer shorts , Mr David , sir . - No way are these mine . These bend ! - What have you done ? - I 've done a spot of tidying up . Where is everything ? Where 's me coffee cup with the mould in it ? - I threw it away , sir . - I was breeding that mould ! His name was Albert ! I was trying to get him two foot high ! - Why , sir ? - Because it drives Rimmer nuts . Driving Rimmer nuts is what keeps me going . - I 'm sorry , Mr David , sir . - Look at you . - Why are you doing this ? - Serving makes me happy , sir . But don 't you want to do anything for yourself ? Myself ? That 's a barmy notion , if you don 't mind my saying so , sir ! There must be something you look forward to . Androids . # Androids # Everybody needs good androids ... # - That stupid soap opera ? Why ? - Because I can forget I 'm me . Androids . What else ? - Being asleep . - Androids and being asleep ? Sounds like a crazy , fun-packed life you lead there , Kryten , me old son ! I have strange thoughts when I 'm asleep . - Yeah , they 're called dreams . - My favourite is about a garden . I 've never even seen a garden , except in books . And I 've planted everything and made it grow . It 's my garden , and there 's no one there but me , just me and all the things I made live . Silly . No , it isn 't . Find a planet and do it . I can 't . I 'm programmed to serve . But there 's no one to serve now , Kryten . What about Mr Arnold ? I 've got to complete Mr Arnold 's tasks . You what ? ! Rimmer gave you all this ? Well , Mr Arnold is my master now . " Mr Arnold " isn 't his name . His name 's " Rimmer " ... or " Smeghead " ... or " Dinosaur Breath " , or " Molecule Mind " . And on a very rare occasion , when you wanna be really mega-polite to him , you can call him " Arsehole " . Yeah , yeah , yeah ! I think it 'll be best on that wall , sort of dominating the room . - Yes , Mr Arnold , sir . - " Yes Mr Arnold , sir ! " - You 're a total gwenlin , Kryten . - Yes , Mr David , sir . - " Yes Mr David , sir ! " - Leave it alone , Lister . - It enjoys the tasks I give it . - Drop dead , Rimmer . - Already have done . - Encore . A cat would never be a servant . Ever see a cat return a stick ? " Hey , man , you threw the stick , you go get it yourself . I 'm busy ! " If you wanted the stick , why 'd you throw it away ? " Kryten , you got nothing from those movies . - What movies ? - Mr David showed me the Wild Ones , Easy Rider and Rebel Without A Cause . I thought it might do him good . Fat chance . During Marlon Brando 's rebel speech , he gets a brush-a-matic and does my lapels ! Well , now maybe you 'll learn , Lister . There 's a natural order to things . Some give orders , others obey . That 's how it 's always been , that 's how it 'll always be . Eh , Kryten ? - Oh , yes , Mr Arnold , sir . - Oh , what 's the point ? - Well , I 've finished , Mr Arnold , sir . - Excellent , Kryten ! I think it 's rather good . Don 't you ? - WHAT are you doing ? - I , erm ... I think I 'm , er ... I 'm rebelling . - Rebelling ? - I , er ... sort of ... I think that 's what I 'm doing . You ... are rebelling ? Yes . What are you rebelling against ? Whaddya got ? Dinosaur breath ! Molecule mind ! Smeg-for-brains ! - I need your bike ! - You got it ! Swivel on it , punk ! # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

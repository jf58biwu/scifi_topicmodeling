 Good evening . I am Howard K. Smith . And this is the state of the war tonight . The defenders of CÃ³rdoba , the last free city in Spain ... refused to surrender this week despite seven weeks of savage fighting . When offered terms by the Visitors ... Juan Palacios , the leader of the Spanish Resistance ... is reported to have replied ... " Spain for the Spanish , death to the Visitors . " In LA , the wounding of Nathan Bates remains an issue of great dispute ... with both the Aliens and the Resistance blaming each other . As for Bates himself , he has issued a statement outlawing the Resistance ... and placing the city under martial law . Benni Scallini , a 34-year-old insurance man from Atlanta , Georgia ... received the Freedom Network Medal of Valor for his efforts ... in derailing a train , carrying 600 people through a labor camp in Savannah . More than half the prisoners were able to flee from the train . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York . Our hopes are with you . Good night . What you need is a thermonebulon rasafrats . The last thing I need is a stand-up lab assistant . It 's quitting time , you better be nice to me ... or I won 't come back . - Night , Doc . - Good night . Resistance . Don 't anybody move . Where 's Nathan Bates ? Nathan Bates ? What are you talking about ? Either you tell me where he is , or we 'll start doing some serious damage . You can 't do this . This is private property . Starting with you . Now , I know he 's here . Talk to me . He was never brought here . I swear . You 're a liar . They 'd never trust a hospital . All right , let 's get out of here . I believed in the Resistance . Why did you do this ? We pause for a moment to bring you the latest report on Science Frontiers ... where Mary McHugh is standing by . I 'm here at the headquarters of Nathan Bates where members ... of the Los Angeles Resistance staged a violent surprise attack . Apparently the raiders were attempting to kill Mr. Bates ... who was wounded earlier in an assassination attempt ... - What the ... - I 'm sorry . - What was that , an earthquake ? - No , I was experimenting . I 'm not quite sure how to control my powers . I 've been practicing . Practicing ? Practicing what ? Becoming an alarm clock ? You looked kind of restless , I felt like I needed to hold you . And before I knew it , I was holding you . Along with the bed ? - And then you dropped me ? - I didn 't mean to . The news was on and there 's been another attempt on your father 's life . - Where ? - Science Frontiers , but he wasn 't there . I got upset and I lost my concentration . At least we know he 's still alive . No matter how hard I try ... I can 't get the picture of my father being shot out of my mind . It 's nice to be wanted . - Especially for something we didn 't do . - The question is , who did ? We 'll check out other Resistance groups in the city . Find out what the word is . Robin , you get over and see George Caniff at the underground newspaper . - We need to set the record straight . - I 'm on my way . Think we better do a little digging of our own . Let 's do it . Then our agent has arrived in the Open City ? He 's already made a contact ... that he believes we 'll put him in touch with the Resistance . Good . Keep me informed . Guards , cease them . I wouldn 't advise that , Diana . What are the Resistance doing here ? The Resistance ? Why , Diana , dear ? Don 't you know Lt. James of Covert Operations ? I thought you were familiar with all the males in the fleet . Familiar , Lydia , not intimate . - James . - Sir . - It went well ? - Like clockwork . Just a scratch . I 'll arrange a battlefield commendation for you . You are dismissed . Your plan to set our enemies against each other seems to be right on schedule . What one really needs to do is to observe their history ... to discover they have this absurd passion for trying to destroy themselves . Fifty million people were slaughtered in their Second World War ... and that was despite the limitations of primitive weaponry . If we hadn 't arrived , they would 've certainly resorted to a nuclear holocaust . The fallout would have made the entire population inedible . So , thanks to James and his commandos , the people of Los Angeles ... see the Resistance as a direct threat to their safety . Precisely . The next step is to reach Bates himself . - Unless he is already dead . - He 's not , he 's alive . - I 'm sure of that . Are you ? - I am . If Bates were dead , he 'd be choking on the Red Dust by now . He wears a fail-safe device on his wrist ... that releases the dust the moment his pulse stops beating . A true paranoid . No wonder he 's been so successful . Given your familiarity with the subject , perhaps you 'd care to join me . You can relax , Reggie , nobody 's gonna hurt you . Julie ? Yeah , it 's me . What 's going on ? You were at Science Frontiers the night it was raided . Yeah , so ? I need to know exactly what went down . It 's like I told the police , the Resistance came looking for Bates . You 're lying , Reggie . We 're friends , remember ? Friends like you are gonna get me killed . - Who 's gonna kill you ? - Nobody . I didn 't see anything , don 't know anything . I don 't want to get involved . You already are ! Talk to me . I swear I won 't use your name . There 'll be no court , no press . I need to know the truth . When they raided us one of the guys got shot . I couldn 't believe they were with the Resistance ... the way they roughed everybody up . And then I knew they weren 't . I saw the guy who got shot . His blood was green . Still no change . Doctor , please let me know the moment he comes out of the coma . Mr. Chiang ? Charles and Diana are here to see Mr. Bates . Should I send them away ? On the contrary . Send them to Mr. Bates ' office . I will take care of the matter . Aren 't your new seating habits somewhat premature , Mr. Chiang ? I wonder if you 'd be as quick in Mr. Bates ' grave . Mr. Bates requests you excuse his unwillingness to meet with you . And under these circumstances ... he prefers to keep his enemies at arm 's length . Enemies ? I hardly think so , Mr. Chiang . Allies comes closer to the mark . I 'm sure Nathan is aware of who shot him . And who set him up . He does not wish to make the same mistake a second time . Naturally . But then the answer is simple . We must work together to eliminate the Resistance . What happened with Ham Tyler was an unfortunate accident . Surely Mr. Bates can see that the Resistance has him marked for death . The Resistance attack on this building is proof that we must act before they do . I will convey your message to Mr. Bates . Victory requires action . I have a plan . - Would you do the honors ? - Of course . - Excuse me . - Surely . That should do it . You are about to witness an interesting technical achievement . The computer generates a basic facial structure . Now , watch closely . We program in human characteristics . Skin tone , hair color , eye pigmentation . Hello , Mr. Chiang . I hope you will listen to what Charles has to offer you . I thought you might be interested . Most interested . - It looks and sounds exactly ... - Like Nathan Bates . You see , I 'm offering the ability to speak out without risk . And a chance to avenge those who tried to kill him . Perhaps you 're right . I think it 's time to break the back of the Resistance once and for all . " Tigers are often called the most beautiful of the big cats ... " as well as the most powerful and dangerous to man . " But the threat they pose to man has been greatly exaggerated ... " even though they grow to a length of 10 feet . " - Ten feet ? - That 's right , Nicky . It 's 10 feet long . That doesn 't include their tails . George . - Robin . - Hi . - Do you have a minute ? - Sure . Private ? - Depends . - He 's okay . I 'm your roving tiger expert , in from Rajasthan . Robin Maxwell . John Langley . John 's a stringer from the Phoenix Post . He just brought in a interesting piece on what 's going on in occupied territory . Mucho gusto . Don 't let me interrupt . That business out at Science Frontiers ? What 's the deal out there ? What am I supposed to print ? Just the truth . We had nothing to do with it . You 're with the Resistance . Who 's going to believe you ? I would . Nicky . Time to wash up . Wait . I 'm looking at tigers . You are all under arrest . - What is this ? - You 'll find out all about it . - What are you doing ? - Watch it . Stop it . Leave me alone . Get off me . All right . I 'll go quietly . You are not going anywhere . No one 's going anywhere . Come on , get them in the back . I come to you today by the grace of God and a bulletproof vest . All rumors as to the extent of my injuries have been grossly exaggerated ... by the same people who attempted to assassinate me . We can no longer tolerate the chaos and anarchy ... that these thugs bring upon us . They are a cancer to our society . They must be rooted out and destroyed . Accordingly , I have ordered the arrest ... of a number of known Resistance sympathizers . Unless the Resistance leaders ... Mike Donovan , Ham Tyler ... Julie Parrish surrender ... one prisoner per day will be handed over to the Visitors for execution . Damn him . This has been the most difficult decision of my entire life ... but I know your hopes and prayers are with me . Thank you and good day . My slug should have caught him between the eyes . Sonny-boy still loves his daddy , huh ? You 're a real hero when it comes to shooting unarmed men . Stop it . Both of you ! We 're behaving exactly like they want us to behave . All I want is a piece of him . Kyle , Ham , what are you doing ? You 're not enemies . She is right . We can 't fight them if we fight ourselves . We have got to free those hostages . Free them ? We don 't even know where they are . Somebody out there has to have seen something . - Let 's split up and find them . - You come with me , all right ? Remember they 've seen our faces . They 'll be looking for us . They always are . They came after me . I 'm sorry you two got involved . Don 't be . I 'm tired of sitting on the sidelines with a notepad while others fight . I just don 't understand why they 're keeping us here . My guess is , in reprisal for the attack on Science Frontiers . But I told you the Resistance had nothing to do with it . I guess Nathan Bates has a different idea . Boy , my family . I never even got a chance to say goodbye to them . Goodbye ? If they can 't connect us with that raid , they can 't keep us here . My guess is you 'll be back with your family in 48 hours . - You don 't believe that , do you ? - No . But he needs to . - It 's getting hard to be invisible . - Tell me about it . All right , he 's coming . Thanks for coming , Glen . All of us don 't play ball with the lizards . What about the hostages ? Nothing . If they were being kept at any city facility , I 'd hear about it . What do you think ? I don 't know . Beats me . One thing 's for sure . If those folks die at noon tomorrow , you guys ain 't gonna have many friends . May I have your attention , please . I 'll try to be as short as possible . If you got any shorter , you 'd need a ladder to tie your shoe laces . As I was saying ... before I was rudely interrupted by our comedic friend here ... unless the Resistance surrenders ... one of you each day will be turned over to the Visitors . You can 't do that . The order will be determined by lot . Draw your number . Now . Number five . Next . She was on the street looking for us . Mrs. Caniff . Her husband 's captured . Why aren 't you doing something to save them ? - You 're Mrs. Caniff ? - Yes . We know that your husband 's shop was raided . Do you have any idea where they may have been taken ? Taken ? They weren 't taken anywhere . They 're holding them at the store . They 're looking for you . My husband belongs with his family . What am I supposed to tell our little boy ? He keeps asking for his daddy . Mrs. Caniff , we 'll help . But we need some information . Was there a young woman there ? They took five others . One was a young girl . Mrs. Caniff , I want you to know , we 'll try ... Try ? Trying won 't bring back my husband . It takes courage . You want to help us ? Surrender . Let my husband live . I don 't know how to say this . We all feel terrible about what 's happened to your husband . But he 's not in it alone . There are others . Surrender ? I 'd do it in a second if I thought it would stop the killing . But it won 't . This is Visitor blackmail , pure and simple . If we give in now , there 's no telling where it 'll stop . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Caniff , but you 're just gonna have to trust us . We 're gonna save your husband our own way . Number three . Now , only two left . Publisher and our comedic friend . I got a feeling this is going to be my lucky day . What did I tell you ? You 're looking at number one . How appropriate . Now , all that is left to do is to wait for the Resistance to surrender ... if they surrender . Come on , you have to get this platform finished by tomorrow morning . Diana will have us for breakfast . What 's wrong ? As a child , my mother would teach us to hunt at night . I was always afraid of the night . Relax . Have I ever let you down ? No , you are my best friend here . I think we hit the jackpot . Well , then , let us go back and tell the others now . Let 's make sure first . Stay here . - Robin . - Robin ? Where ? They are holding Robin in there with the others . - Wait here . - Where are you going ? I want to see what that platform is for . Over there ! - Kill him . - Disintegrate . Oh , God , they killed Elias . Hang on . There 's nothing you can do for him now . Hang on , for your own sake . For me . The Resistance doesn 't work alone . I think Willie got away . Then they 'll know where you are . They won 't let you die here . They 'll be back . But there 's so little time for you . Then let 's not waste the time we have . Don 't ever leave me . Never . Even if I could . She knew the guy . Resistance . - Some toy , that rig that nailed him . - Yeah . I 've seen them use it before in Prescott on Resistance fighters . Kind of makes you feel they 're serious about us , doesn 't it ? What 's your story , John ? Your real story . I 'm the guy that never got involved . Until you felt a sudden compulsion to be a hero ? That 's not generally the way it works . I just got tired of other people dying for me . Just that simple . Look , I thought it over . I can 't let you take my place . - You don 't have a choice . - No , that 's where you 're wrong . I chose to be a part of the Resistance . Nobody held a gun to my head . Now , you want to be a hero , that 's fine , but not at the price of my conscience . Listen , you got a family to think about . You got a woman who loves you , a son whose life depends on you . You 're part of the struggle . I got nothing out there ... but a lot of old , used-up war stories . This is my big chance , George . If I can buy some time for you and her ... just one day ... then maybe my life will be worth something . Nobody 's going to deny me that . I think maybe it 's time that we considered turning ourselves in . We 'd better consider it . Could be just a matter of time before they catch up . They have my mother , and I love her . But you can 't surrender . You do , and it 's over for the Resistance . That 's not true . The movement will find other leaders . - Don 't look at me . - Why not ? You 're not exactly what I 'd call a born follower . - You know that 's not the point . - Kyle , we 're not martyrs . But I am not going to stand around while innocent people die in my place . Nobody 's asking you to sit around . - How 's Willie doing ? - He 's still pretty shook-up . - Come on , get up . - Tyler , back off . He 's had it bad enough without you getting on his case . I said , get up . Every war has its dead heroes . Those are the rules . I don 't believe this . Isn 't anybody allowed to show emotion around here ? Not when it gets in the way of what we have to do . He 's gone , Willie . Look at me . Elias is dead and there 's nothing you can do to bring him back . Now we need to know what 's going on out there ... or a lot of other people are gonna die , including her mother . How can I be of insistence ? The Resistance must surrender or lose their popular support . Either way , they 're on the verge of extinction . At the academy , one of the first principles you learn regarding heroes ... is that they are completely vulnerable to manipulation . When I was at the academy and heard you lecture ... I dreamed of serving under you . - I remember you well . - Do you really ? I looked so different then . But your eyes burnt with the same fire . For the solitude of permanent quarters . - Good evening , Charles . - Good evening . Why , Lydia , you 're working late . Do you ever stop ? Not when we 're at war . You sent for me ? Yes , you 're right on schedule . I 've been reviewing your report on the Star-child ... and it deals almost entirely with her mother . Explain why that is . Robin 's DNA is very unusual . It 's very susceptible to recombination . Which is why I was able to crossbreed her with Brian to create Elizabeth . Unfortunately , I haven 't been able to find any other humans ... with the same genetic compatibility . I see that you received my gift . Yes , thank you . Napoleon brandy . A rather elegant elixir named after one of mankind 's rare geniuses . Yes , and what happened to him ? He was left on a scab of rock to die . Something to ponder , Diana . Good morning . What 's so good about it ? Don 't tell me you 're one of those people ... who 's a total grouch before you 've had your first cup of coffee . My mother was like that . Used to drive me crazy . How can you make jokes at a time like this ? I 've got about six hours left . What else is there to do ? To late to feel sorry for myself now . Tell me one thing . Why did you do it ? Why did you switch numbers ? I guess you could call it a serious character flaw . Excessive ego . All my life I 've always wanted to be first in everything I did . For what it 's worth ... you 're really one of the bravest men I 've ever met . Thank you . What we 're pulling here is a hijack off a diversion . Only , we 're after people , not equipment . Speaking of which , that disintegrator is no popgun . No , it was truly terrible . Remember , timing is everything . We 've got to move on before they get a chance to use it . Chris has rigged up a throat-mike , so be sure to listen for my command . Willie , you go with Kyle in the truck . Everybody else comes with me . - Chris , you drive the van . - You got it . I must not fail . If only I had not failed Elias . Willie , you didn 't fail Elias . - You mustn 't think that way . - He was a warrior . I am only a ... You 're a warrior , too , Willie . A different kind of warrior . Elias is gone . But it 's up to us to do something about it . We know he wasn 't perfect . He took advantage of what we went through to set himself up . Flashy restaurant , the whole nine yards . But when it counted , when the Visitors returned ... the truth was , he cared too much to turn his back on us . He took us in , he gave us a place to stay . He paid for it with his life . If you think about it , we 're all together right now because of him . I 'd say we owe him one . Good day , Mr. Chiang . It 's a pity Mr. Bates isn 't well enough to attend . Mr. Bates knows what 's about to take place . He feels no obligation to bear witness in person . The execution will be televised for all to see . We shall miss him nonetheless . I believe you haven 't had the opportunity to see the disintegrator in operation . I 've been told it is most impressive . - Any word from the Resistance ? - None whatsoever . I hope they don 't disappoint us . They won 't . At least the wait 's over . I would like to tell your friends we got you off the hook ... but the cowards didn 't turn themselves in . Don 't call them cowards . Let 's go . Say your goodbyes . I wish we had more time to get to know each other better . I can 't let you go through with this , John . He took my number . I 'm supposed to go first . You 'll all get your turn . Right now , my orders say he kicks things off . How can you do this ? Turn him over to those monsters ? I 'm just doing my job . Move it . I 'll never forget you . The important thing is to remember why we 're here ... what we stand for , and what it means to be free . Testing , this is Eagle One . Do you read me ? Come in , Sky Hook . Over . This is Sky Hook , Eagle One . We read you loud and clear . Over . I 'm a block from the target . Any word from the Catcher ? The Catcher is ready , all sisters go . Just give us the word and we 're ready to roll . Over . I 'm on my way . Over and out . I 'll get the smoke grenades . You know what to do ? You just get them out , I 'll be there . No way we can get close to them without being seen . If I shoot him , those hostages are dead meat . We 've got to take him out . Cover me . You stick your head out there , it 's gonna get shot off . We can 't stay here . - Maybe I can help . - You 're not going out there . - I can do it from here . - Be our guest . I think we may have a little problem here . On the contrary , Diana . Charles 's plan has worked to perfection . Charles . Here I am . - Let him go . - That was the bargain . Indeed it was , Mr. Chiang . Release him . Mr. Donovan has arrived to take his place . A most courageous gesture on your part . We all do what we can . It 's not working . Nothing is happening , I 'm sorry . It 's okay , sweetheart . You gave it your best shot . Then why isn 't it working ? I can 't feel any energy . You can figure that one out later . Right now , he 's our main concern . Julie , no ! - What was that ? - Go check it out . What 's going on back there ? Out the back door . Go on . Come on . No , thanks . I brought my own . Unless you have any final requests . No requests and no regrets . What a way to go . That 's our cue . Get going . Take off ! Don 't shoot . He 's mine . That hurt . Next time , Mr. Donovan . How 's our little secret weapon doing ? She 's fine . My wife and I want to thank you for what you did back there . Really . Nobody 's perfect . Why don 't you hang around ? We can always use a guy with some guts . Not a lot of call for second-string war correspondents nowadays . I wouldn 't say that . English

 [ whooshing ] [ roaring ] [ Man on radio ] : T.U.A. , three five heavy , descend to 3000 feet . [ Pilot ] : Minneapolis center , this is Trans-Universal three five heavy , descending to 3000 . [ Radio ] : Roger , T.U.A. three five heavy . T.U.A. three five heavy , could you give me your location ? Ron , where the hell are we ? 25 miles due south on approach , descending through 5000 feet . [ Radio ] : Three five , what is your current heading ? What 's his problem ? Minneapolis , we are currently heading zero - [ Radio ] : T.U.A. three five , turn to heading - [ static ] Say again , Minneapolis . [ suspenseful music ] Jesus , down . Oh my God . Down , go down . [ metal crunching ] My God , we hit ' em , we hit ' em ! [ alarm blaring ] Minneapolis , this is T.U.A. three five . Declaring an emergency , we hit another aircraft . Looked like a 10 . Three and four shutting down , cutting fuel to three . We are going down , repeat , going down . How much of the wing is gone ? Ron , get back there . See how much we have left . Right . [ rhythmic buzzing ] [ explosions ] [ thrilling music ] [ music becomes peaceful ] [ propellers ] [ planes passing overhead ] - [ Woman ] : There he is . - [ Man ] : Excuse me ! [ reporters clamoring ] [ helicopter idling ] Mr. Smith , I 'm Kevin Briley , from the Minneapolis office - And you 're not doing your job . Round these people up and shove ' em in a room somewhere . Make no statement 'till I get back . Ashby , tell ' em what we need . Right , c 'mon , move it . The rest of y 'all , let 's go . - Move it ! - Back up , back up . Come on , people , let 's go now , do it ! [ ominous music ] [ Investigator ] : Where 'd the DC-10 go down ? [ Pilot ] : 10 miles to the south . Jerry , Eli , go take a look . Tom and I 'll put down here . [ eerie music ] Wanna give me a hand with this ? [ workers talking ] [ Man ] : Bill . Alright . [ Man ] : Bill . [ Man # 2 ] : Get the flashlight over here ! We were just going after the flight data recorder . You wanna do that next ? Sure . I think that the DC-10 site came down a lot harder than this one . What happened here ? Well , he managed to get it level , but you might have noticed there 's only three engines . One came down south of here . So he lost a lot of wing ? We think so , yeah . We started on the site map , and the cops have finally stopped moving things around . [ distant sirens ] Look , Bill , uh , we 're being very careful but we don 't think that this is a structural failure , natural . Do you have any numbers yet ? Yeah , yeah , got ' em right here . [ men shouting ] This one had 354 and 13 crew and the 10 had 265 and 11 . Watch that wing section there . Do you already have the cockpit voice recorder ? Yeah , we have it , but it 's pretty battered . They 're working on it now . I want a dub made before you send it on to Washington . Alright , I 'll tell ' em , but it might not be too good . [ Man ] : It 's a silly rule . Why should the boys in Washington hear it first ? I gotta hear what those poor bastards were up against after they hit the 10 . I 'm sure they did their best . They always do . Are you one of Roger 's team ? I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer . I 'm the investigator in charge , Bill Smith . Bill Smith , yes , I know . I 've read many of your crash reports . Naturally I 've heard of you , Doctor . What 's your interest here ? You want me to leave ? No , it doesn 't matter . All this just seems pretty far removed from your physics lab . Maybe scientists should leave the lab more often . They might learn some things . Dr. Mayer , what 's an ecology professor doing at a crash site ? Do you know someone on the plane ? Not that I 'm aware of . How did you hear about the crash , sir ? I got a call from a television [ drowned out ] He 's the last guy I 'd expect to find out here . Yeah , actually , he 's not . He 's been to several midwest crashes . That big one in ' 79 at O 'Hare , he was all over that one . I wonder why . I don 't think it will win him another Nobel prize . Over here , I got it ! There 's a whole mob here from Boeing , and the man from McDonnell Douglas is on the way . Wes Lake from the F.B.I is here , and the assistant D.A. from Ramsey County . Okay , the usual gang . Mr. Janz , I 'm Bill Smith of the NTSB . Mr. Smith , my name is Raymond Leacock . I represent Mr. Janz . Is this a formal deposition ? Not yet . I 'm sitting in on this . Bill , meet Ian Carpenter . He 's with the Air Traffic Controllers Organization . Mr. Janz , I know this is a hard time for you . I want to hear what you saw , and what your actions were . We were handling 40 flights , three of us , plus the private planes . The screen was so crowded . And a goddamned headache . I was tired . 35 was coming in from the east . No , from the west , and 880 was coming in . Was that the 747 , Don ? I looked away for a moment . Some other situation . And when I looked back , they 'd changed places . I told 35 to turn . They were close , man . And then the numbers switched . You couldn 't tell 'em apart anymore . Somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . Well , that DC-10 was pretty public . It spread itself over a field not half a mile from the Interstate . Right . And they don 't want people gawking at their ... What was it they called that crash in Florida ? Involuntary conversion . I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off . Yeah , well , they sure are busting their asses on this one . Look at that , they even got the ticket agents serving coffee . [ Man ] : Mr. Keane , where does this go ? What do you wanna do with this stuff ? Did I tell you you could touch that ? Excuse me . Put that down ! Just put that down . Hey . How about some coffee ? Hey , wait a minute . I think she likes you , Bill . What 'd I do ? Could it be your breath ? I thought you always got that reaction . Gentlemen , they 're ready to play the cockpit tapes . [ Pilot ] : Minneapolis , we are currently heading zero - [ Controller ] : T.U.A. three five , turn to heading - [ static ] [ Pilot ] : Say again , Minneapolis . ... Jesus , down . [ Copilot ] : Oh my God . [ Pilot ] : Down , go down . [ metal crunching ] [ alarm blaring ] [ Copilot ] : My God , we hit ' em , we hit ' em ! [ Pilot ] : Minneapolis , this is T.U.A. three five , declaring an emergency : We hit another aircraft . Looked like a 10 . [ Flight engineer ] : Three and four shutting down , cutting fuel to three . [ Pilot ] : We are going down , repeat , going down . [ Engineer ] : How much of the wing is gone ? [ Pilot ] : Ron , get back there , see how much we have left . [ Engineer ] : Right . Would you like some coffee , Mr. Smith ? Dammit , I 'm listenin ' - [ Pilot ] : Still going down . Is there any place to land ? [ Copilot ] : I 'll check - [ clicks button ] Can you rewind that a little ? [ garbled audio ] [ Pilot ] : Still going down . Is there any place to land ? [ Copilot ] : I 'll check for a field . [ Pilot ] : Just look for a flat place , anything . We 'll be on the ground in - [ Engineer ] : They 're dead , they 're all dead . [ Pilot ] : What the hell 's he talking about ? Sit down for Christ 's sake , Ron . [ Engineer ] : They 're dead , all of ' em , they 're burned up . [ flames and crunching metal ] [ Pilot ] : Jesus . [ Copilot ] : Yes , here it comes . [ flames roaring ] [ loud crash ] [ silence ] Was that Kennedy shouting ? Yeah , Rockwell couldn 't understand him . Run that last part through again . I 'll see if I can clean it up a bit for ya . [ Pilot ] : Just look for a flat place , anything . We 'll be on the ground in - [ Engineer ] : They 're dead , they 're all dead ! [ Pilot ] : What the hell 's he talking about ? Sit down for Christ 's sake , Ron . [ Engineer ] : They 're dead , all of them , they 're burned up . [ Pilot ] : Jesus . [ clicks button ] Burned up ? They were going to be . They might as well have been dead already . Makes me sick . Yeah , but it doesn 't make sense . You expect him to make sense at a time like that ? No , not like that . Okay , I 'll back the pilots . Like they say , they 're the first on the scene of the accident . But how many crash tapes have you heard ? God , too many . But how many times do you hear a man come apart like that ? [ sighs ] Okay , but it 's gotta happen sometime . He goes back there and sees all those people who are gonna die and it 's too much for him . Obviously they hadn 't burned up yet . Well , what about , if , uh , maybe , maybe there was a fire in the cabin , maybe they were burned up already ? Sorry , but that won 't work . The fuselage was unaffected by fire until after impact . He just broke under the strain . Get me a transcript of that tape . Roger , set up a press conference for tonight . Let 's go see what the dead have to say about it . This gymnasium , is this the biggest place they could find ? [ Keane ] : Oh , Bill , I 've got something interesting for you . These are pretty good bodies in here . Next door we got stuff from the DC-10 , which is mostly pieces , can 't be identified . Next of kin are gonna have to look at personal effects , mostly , not many faces to show them . Then the F.B.I. takes over . We 'll be lucky to tag 60 % for fingerprints and dental charts . Not enough hands , not enough heads . We autopsied a few , and they died of trauma , dismemberment , burns , the usual . We gotta get some reefer trucks in here , and some airtight coffins - Yeah , they 're on their way . Look , I only got this place for two days . I got a dance - Trucks will be here . Okay . Now , here 's what I wanted you to see . Two kinds of watches , okay ? Mechanicals here , and digitals here . Now , these digitals didn 't do so good . Mostly they 're blank . Heat must have wiped ' em out . But we did find this . Yeah , so what ? Well , so take a closer look . It 's going backwards . This better not be a joke . It 's not . Somebody had a gag watch . Well , we thought of that . Look at this . [ crowd chattering ] Good evening . You all have copies of the prepared statement . I 'm William Smith , investigator in charge . I 'll try to answer your questions , but I warn you , we don 't know much more than is in that statement . Who wants to go first ? [ Man ] : Mr. Smith ! [ all clamoring ] Sir , there have been rumors of some type of computer error being the cause of this crash . Can you confirm this ? That 's being looked at . I can 't say more at this time . [ clamoring ] When can we talk to the controller who was handling the planes ? You 'll have to take that up with the man 's lawyer . Mr. Smith , you 're on record as issuing a pretty harsh indictment of the FAA for failing to require anti-collision devices on all commercial and private aircraft , even though , as you note , these devices have been available for over a decade . Would you care to comment ? Dr. Mayer , do you have any idea what caused this crash ? One of Newton 's Laws , I suspect , the one about gravity . Beyond that I don 't know any more than you do . Can I have an interview , Doctor ? Gentlemen , please , I have to get in there and ask some questions of my own . Would you care to reply to the charge made by Mr. Carpenter ? No reply at this time . Next question . Mr. Smith , I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer , professor of physics at the university . [ Bill ] : I remember you . Thank you . My question has nothing to do with overloaded computers or negligent air traffic controllers . [ Bill ] : That should be refreshing . I doubt it . What unusual facts have you developed so far in your investigation ? I 'm not sure I know what you mean . Were there any unexplained observations ? Is there any indication that this crash was caused by something less obvious than a computer overload ? None at all , of course , every crash is unique . Yet they share common factors . There are things you expect to find and things you don 't . For instance , is there anything in the cockpit voice recording that 's out of the ordinary ? I can 't comment on that ; it 's confidential . The relevant portions will be released in a couple of days . You can listen for yourself . Alright , but is there anything else odd ? Have you found any unusual item in the wreckage ? Any discrepancies in the time sequence of the crash ? [ coughing ] I 'm afraid I still don 't know what you 're driving at . I can 't be more plain without sounding like a fool . I 'm simply looking for the inexplicable ; I usually find it . Look , somebody made a mistake , and a lot of people died . In a few days we should be able to tell you what went wrong . There 's no mystery about it . Then I salute you . I 'll read your report with interest . [ Woman on P.A. ] : All T.U.A. personnel , please check with your supervisor for shift changes . So , is there anything else you need tonight ? I want the salvage team to work through the night . You got it . Better keep crew at the hangar , too . Might as well start getting it all sorted out . Alright , it 's done . Oh , my secretary managed to get you a room at the Marriott . Tom , you 're staying at the Holiday Inn . Privilege of rank , I guess . Why ? They got a big beauty pageant there tonight . Miss I-94 . You know , I hear the bar 's pretty wild . Well , I 'm outta here . Thanks , Roger , your people did a great job . Our usual service . Alright , well , I 'll see you tomorrow . Yeah . [ P.A. ] : Los Angeles passenger Mr. George Kelliman , please pick up the white courtesy telephone . [ door chimes ] Mr. George Kelliman to the white courtesy telephone , please .. I keep running into you . If you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . I thought I was going to be sick . I guess you get used to it after a while . [ escalator clanks ] [ chuckles ] Excuse me . Well , we could be stuck here for hours . Maybe we 'd better get acquainted . I 'm Louise Baltimore , and you 're Bill Smith . How long is it since you slept ? Do I look that bad ? I didn 't say bad , just tired . It 's gotta be 30 , 35 hours , but who needs sleep ? Listen , maybe we could go have coff - Some dinner , and a few drinks , that 'd be nifty . Am I moving too fast for you ? I can move fast , too . Let 's go . You should be careful , picking up strange women . You never know where it might lead . [ gasps ] Taxi . We could take my car . What kind of car do you drive ? What kind ? That 's mine . You smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . Just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before , took me over a year to quit . You don 't believe me ? This is my last cigarette . Was it that good ? You were the best thing in 1000 years , Bill . I was , wasn 't I ? I 'm stunned . Why ? It 's been so long since I 've ... enjoyed myself ... let alone been swept away . Do you believe in fate ? I will if you will . I think it was fate that brought us together . You may be right . I want to spend more time with you . I 'd like that . We 'll have all day tomorrow . We 'll have all tomorrow night , anyway . This job is killing you , Bill . You need to take a rest . Take it with me . The first rule is ... never go to bed with anybody crazier than yourself . I don 't know if you 're crazier , but you 're right up there in the top ten of my weird list , lady . If you knew me better ... I 'd be number one . [ romantic music ] [ coughs ] Yes , I 'd like to cancel the 6 : 30 wakeup . Yes . Damn it , they were supposed to call me . Well , they can 't start 'till you get there . Bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? Sure , I remember . Maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . Are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . This job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . Why not ? The world 's not gonna come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years , I got one coming . In one week , I 'll have this investigation started , and I can hand it over to someone else . Then I 'm gonna take a long look at my life . Maybe we can go away somewhere together . Anyway , we got tonight . I may not be here tonight . We 'll talk about it tonight . Louise ? [ mysterious music ] Louise ? Now , as to systems surrounding engine number four , which was the one that sheared off in the collision , let 's consider the fuel feed first . You 'll find that on page 19 of the computer printout . [ rustling papers ] Everybody got that ? On line five you will see there was a momentary surge when fuel line number four was severed along with 25 feet of wing tip . They 'll have a better figure on that by tomorrow , they tell me . [ phone rings ] Smith . Julie , thanks for calling back . No , it has nothing to do with the investigation . I can 't understand it . She was wearing a T.U. outfit . That 's right , Baltimore , like the city . First name , Louise . I guess I made a mistake , then . Thanks , Julie . ... It looks like the captain had very little control . Good night , fellas . Good night . We 're locking up , Mr. Smith . What 's that ? There 'll be a guard on that door over there . Just knock on the glass when you want to go . I 'll do that . Good night . Hell of a mess , huh ? One hell of a mess . Good night . [ lights clicking rhythmically ] [ faint beeping ] [ suspenseful music ] [ rapid beeping ] [ electricity crackles ] Smith , isn 't it ? I 'm not sure . Looks like the pictures I saw . Is he dead ? Stunned . God dammit . Where 's the stunner ? There . He must have been fooling with it . Is he out ? Our luck , he 's probably seeing and hearing everything . If he is , it 's already too late . [ sighs ] God , what else can go wrong ? Let 's get the hell out . Smith , you 're gonna be all right . You don 't know me and I can 't tell you who I am . But you 're endangering a project that 's bigger than you can imagine . Forget about this . There 's gonna be a paradox if you don 't . You ... You ... Coventry , send the gate . [ ethereal whirring ] [ Bill wheezes ] My God , do you think ... ? We didn 't make those planes crash , I swear it . [ whirr grows louder ] [ Man on P.A. ] Stand by for time travellers arriving through gate Gantry D. Operator , prepare for arrival . We have major problems . What happened ? We got the stunner . Imagine my relief . [ P.A. ] : Louise , I want an explanation . Our master 's voice . There was a little problem . Those words will be engraved in the annals of understatement . Your mother was a cash register . And she turned a tidy profit , too . Louise , what happened ? [ P.A. ] All gate operators , report to decontamination center on shutdown . Do you see that ? Do you see the red blob on the timeline ? That is 1989 . That 's where you just went . And there 's the mess you left behind you . It 's a goddamn paradox , Louise . [ Louise ] : It 's a potential paradox . You sent me back to get the stunner we lost . Well , here it is . What you didn 't mention was that Smith was there . He 'd already found it and stunned himself . And I don 't think he was out when we found him . I think he saw us . Sir , I have a timequake approaching . [ speaking into P.A. ] Paradox , time quake approaching . Four , three . [ alarms ] [ rumbling ] A paradox , Louise . You 've changed the past . I know damn well we can 't change the past . It catches up with us . We change . Well , we haven 't changed much . We 're all still dying , this place still stinks , and you are still as ugly as ever . One not much bigger than that could destroy us completely . Look , you 're the one that 's supposed to scan the past . Why didn 't you know Smith was gonna be in that hangar ? And you 're supposed to be ready for the unexpected . You 're supposed to be the best . You and your people get all the best food , all the best quarters , all our precious medicine . Do you realize what it costs to pamper you ? He was there , he was in the dark . What did you want me to do , kill him ? Oh , you 'd like that . Killing him would create the worst paradox imaginable . His life affects thousands of other lives in an endless chain , and if you break it - You get a thousand years of bad luck . And none of us is here anymore . Alright . Let 's go find out what happened . Maybe we can still do something . All I 'm getting is temporal censorship from her jump . Scan past it . What does temporal censorship mean ? It means we can 't see where we 've been , or where we 're going to . We can only go back to a specific moment once , and never to that same moment again . Too bad . If we could see where were gonna go - You 'll get used to it , Susan , after you 've done a few more missions . There he is , in the shadow . Give us rapid scan until he moves . Louise ? He knows my name . You probably dropped your calling card . Louise . I didn 't mention my name , neither did anyone else . How does he know my name ? He 's got the initiator . Smith had met me before , hadn 't he ? How else would he know your name ? I 'd never been back to that era . Do you want me to spell it out for you ? Give it a try , would ya ? In Smith 's time he has met you before . In your time you have met him only once , in the hangar , which means you will go back and meet him earlier . I spoke to him , Sherman . That was not a good idea . I didn 't like talking to him , Sherman . I didn 't like it at all . You were not helping him . What 's that supposed to mean ? This seems to be my day for spelling out the obvious . I suppose I should not complain . Come on , you old fraud , prep me for the 1963 flight . [ Woman on P.A. ] : ' 63 mission will proceed to stage one . The 63 mission will proceed to stage one . You did not smoke enough , Louise . Give it to me straight , doc , I can take it . No new degeneration . The levels of complex hydrocarbons in your blood are depressed , due to breathing the primordial atmosphere of the 20th century . They think their air is awful , they ain 't seen nothin ' yet . Maybe I should replace those kidneys . Maybe a little kick , get the ol ' blood moving ? Speed kills , my dear . [ P.A. ] : Uniform and hair for lookalikes will proceed to stage two . Uniforms and hair for lookalikes will proceed to stage two . Sometimes I think you want me to live forever . Okay , so explain it to me . It 's what you were built for . You don 't expect me to know what 's going on in my own head , do ya ? Hardly . All right , on a normal mission , when you are taking people who are about to die off doomed airplanes you do not mind treating them roughly . All done . It 's ' cause I 'm helping them . Obviously , without you , those people would be dead . So you can function without remorse . But with Smith it was different . I don 't think I want to hear any more . [ bird twittering ] How 's the little feather head today ? Louise loves you , Orville , yes , she does . Polly want a chemical free sterilized cracker ? I should take you to 1963 . You could fly . Would you like that ? Huh , would you like that ? You left Smith helpless and confused , so there was pain in you . Alright , I felt sorry for the bastard . But , I 'd-a shot him if it 'd straighten things out . As Coventry said , you did not have that choice . What choices do I have ? You say I have to go back , because he met me before . Yes . What if I don 't go back ? What happens to the universe ? You must go back . Where 's my free will ? Did you lose it ? I will look around for it . This is awful . If you think that 's bad , take a look at this . We located the 1963 crash while you were away . It is likely you will go tomorrow . How are you on the idiom and history ? I know it like the back of my hand . Who was the U.S. president ? Johnson . No , wait , uh , he was assassinated by ... Vito Corleone ? [ chidingly ] Louise . [ zapping ] [ garbled whirring ] We 've talked about quarks and antineutrinos , but what about people ? It 's quite a step from demonstrating that subatomic particles can travel backward through time , to saying that people can . What would be the result of people travelling in time ? For one thing , paradoxes become possible . Say you build a time machine , go back , and murder your father when he was 10 years old . That means you were never born , and if you weren 't how did you build the time machine ? It 's the possibility of paradoxes that make most people rule out time travel by human beings . Still , why not ? If you were careful you could do it . You would not go back to kill Adolf Hitler , much as you might like to . Because it would change history . The time traveler would have to be careful , but he could do a surprising number of things . He could observe , for one . Find out once and for all who was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas . And he will know what we can only guess at , that we are destroying the planet we live on by complacency . He will have to live with our legacy of pollution and acid rain . Our negligence today is producing a world in which our children 's children will be barren , and the human race heading towards extinction . He could also take things , providing they wouldn 't be missed . A cup of water from the Pacific Ocean , a stone from the Grand Canyon . This may sound pointless ... but sometimes very small differences can be crucial . The difference between a dead man ... and a man who 's alive can be very small . What about a man who is about to die , a man no one will ever see alive again . [ Woman on P.A. ] : Stage three alert , all sections go . This is the hard part about looking for time travelers . They don 't want to be found . You must look for them in places where no one is , or where there are people no one will ever see alive again . [ foreboding music ] [ Man on P.A. ] : All personnel stand by for departure . Go , go ! [ startled cry ] [ P.A. ] : Gate attendants , pick up new arrivals , pick up new arrivals . [ Pilot ] : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . This is your captain speaking . We are cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet , [ stunner zaps ] at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour . If you look out the right side , through the clouds , you can see the Finger Lakes . Our expected time of arrival is on schedule at 4 : 30 . So sit back and relax , and enjoy the flight . [ stunner zaps ] Alright , send the others . Everything 's nice and quiet . Let 's keep it that way . [ Man on P.A. ] : Gantry operators prepare for arrival . Extreme radiation danger . May I get you a pillow , sir ? Sure . [ stunner zaps ] Prepare holding pens for arriving passengers . [ whirring and buzzing ] [ stunner zaps ] I 'm through up here . What 's up ? Well , there 's a guy acting funny . He 's watching us too close . - Get up , hey ! - [ screams ] [ screaming ] You 're gonna take me to see the captain . Sir , you can 't shoot that . If you depressurize the cabin you 'll kill us all . Nobody gets hurt if I see the captain . [ gunshot ] [ screaming continues ] You stinking son of a bitch . [ loud zap ] Oof ! Hey , wake up , get in there and cork the crew . You know the flight plan . Keep it steady . Alright , Squad Martin , fast and dirty . This one 's falling apart . [ suspenseful music ] [ alarms blaring ] Did that man shoot her ? Don 't worry , honey , it 's gonna be alright . When she fell - I want you to sleep now . [ stunner zaps ] [ P.A. ] : Attention , attention , initiation phase has commenced . All recovery team personnel stand by . [ Coventry ] : 63 flight in force field . Holding , all systems engaged . Ladies and gentlemen , please remain in your seats . Ladies and gentlemen , please move toward the rear of the plane . Excuse me , would you mind telling me what 's going on ? [ P.A. ] Please step onto the raft , Walk quickly to the bottom , and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety area . Let 's get you out of here . You idiot , that 's the survivor . Buckle him in and come and help me with Susan . Please step onto the ramp . Walk quickly to the bottom , and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety area . Please step onto the ramp . Walk quickly to the bottom , and follow instructions . You will be taken to a safety area . Please step onto the ramp . All substitute bodies will be placed strictly according to the passenger list . Passengers now in transit . Prepare to activate holding pen force fields . So now we know a hijacker caused this crash . We know there was a survivor . We know when it crashed . We just have to duplicate it . I stopped it . I stopped the bullet . You saved us all , kid . Hang in there , you 're gonna be all right . He must have fired his gun in the cockpit . Have Djakarta attach a 5K bomb to the wind screen . That should duplicate the effect . I lost it . What , Susan ? what did you lose ? Stun . Stunner , I lost the stunner . [ ominous music ] [ alarm blaring ] Look out ! Stop it ! Hold the gate ! Stop her . Baltimore , get out of there , get out ! No time , Louise , no time ! Louise , there 's a bomb . [ explosion ] One of my team was shot . In the confusion , a stunner was lost . It was too late to go back and get it . [ Man ] : You know the prevention of paradox is more important than individual lives . Blame is secondary at this point . The first stunner you lost in 1989 ended up briefly in the possession of Bill Smith . He knows what it can do . Then you went back to 1963 and lost another stunner . The computers estimate it wound up in the possession of Arnold Mayer . If he learns what it can do , he might be capable of learning how it works . The council has decided to risk another mission to 1989 . You must meet Smith the day before you saw him in the hangar . You must prevent him from going to that hangar the night he saw you there . Since he knew your name when he saw you , he must have met you previously . Therefore , you did go back . Must go back . Seems I can 't get away from you . I would be a poor personal robot if you could . I lost a very good girl on that plane , Sherman . And what was the council 's epitaph for her ? " Preventing a paradox is more important " than individual lives . " Susan knew that . She accepted it . I just ... [ sighs ] I couldn 't leave her . It is not necessary to destroy your soul in this job , Louise . But a certain amount of violence will be done to it . You made the wrong choice . It is easy for them to make cold choices , Louise . They are hardly human anymore . Am I so different ? We 're all dying , they 're just a little further along . You are different . You have feelings . [ inspiring music ] They want me to go back again . You have to go back . He must be kept out of that hangar . This isn 't a job for me , Sherman . You want somebody bashed in the head , I 'm your girl . You will have to learn new methods . You can do it . I know you can . Then let 's go do it . [ Bill ] : Somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . [ Keane ] : Well , that DC-10 was pretty public . Spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate . Right . They didn 't want people gawking at their ... What was it they called that crash in Florida ? Involuntary conversion . I think they made a profit on that When the insurance paid off . Well , they sure are busting their asses on this one . Take this coffee over there , would you ? Look at that , they even got the ticket agents serving coffee . Put that down , just put that down ! What do I do with this stuff ? Did I tell you you could touch that ? Excuse me . Hey , how about some coffee ? Hey , wait a minute . [ Pilot ] : Declaring an emergency ; we hit another aircraft . Looked like a 10 . [ Engineer ] : Three and four shutting down . Cutting fuel to three . [ Pilot ] : We are going down , repeat , going down . [ Copilot ] : How much of the wing is gone ? [ Pilot ] : Ron , get back there . See how much we have left . [ Engineer ] : Right . Would you like some coffee , Mr. Smith ? after the senior prom in high school . [ Pilot ] : Still going down . Is there any place to land ? [ Copilot ] : I 'll check . [ recording shuts off ] Alright , Sherman , he 's seen me again . I think he 's interested . What next ? What now , Sherman ? Think of something . Take him to dinner , someplace romantic . [ Louise ] : How do I do that ? Pick him up , my dear . How ? [ Sherman ] : Drop your hankie , wiggle your behind . You 're the woman , Louise . You figure it out . Just be subtle . Louise is about as subtle as a lead pipe . Thanks . These should be appropriate to the era , as well as stimulating to the contemporary male . [ comical music ] Sorry about the high heels . [ cheerful music ] [ Woman on P.A. ] : Standby passenger D. Lawrence , report to Gate 17 . D. Lawrence to Gate 17 . [ romantic music ] Standby passenger D. Lawrence , report to Gate 17 . D. Lawrence to Gate 17 . I keep running into you . If you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . I thought I was going to be sick . I guess you get used to it after a while . Oh . [ chuckles ] Excuse me . Well , we could be stuck here for hours . Maybe we 'd better get acquainted . [ gasps ] Taxi . We could take my car . What kind of car do you drive ? What kind ? That 's mine . Why don 't you get in ? You got the keys ? Keys ? [ rapid beeping ] [ lock clicks ] [ engine starts ] [ tires screeching ] [ Bill ] : Whoa ! Tower clear you for that takeoff ? [ energetic rock music ] So , do you know Minneapolis ? Nah , I 've only been here - Watch it ! [ horns honk ] ... a couple of times . Oh , I know a good place . Any place is fine . Something wrong ? Just watch it , Jesus ! [ car horn honking ] You really drive this thing . Are we almost there ? Another two minutes at this velocity . How long have you had this car ? Oh , uh , forever . You must be the luckiest woman in the world . [ horns honk ] [ tires screech ] [ Man ] : Hey , what are you doing ? Idiot ! You alright ? I feel like I should kiss the ground . [ sirens ] [ relaxing music ] [ soft conversation ] Wow , can 't get that anymore . I 'll have another one . Forget the water . Can 't get it anymore ? It 's old , but it 's not that old . Oh , I mean I can 't usually afford - Are you ready to order now ? Bill , would you order for me ? I can never decide . Okay , the sole , and tossed salad , and Italian dressing . That 's the first time I 've ordered for a girl since ... after the senior prom in high school . Did I act improperly ? No . No , it 's just ... haven 't you ever heard of Women 's Lib ? The suffragette movement , 19th Amendment , Rosie the Riveter , bra burning , Gloria Steinem , ERA , the battle of the sexes . Who won ? I think it 's still being fought . We might call a truce for tonight . I 'd like that . Who won ? You have a strange sense of humor . Sometimes it 's like you grew up in a foreign country . I did . I grew up abroad , overseas . Whereabouts ? France . I 'm from France , my father was posted there . He was a warrior . Soldier ? That 's right , a soldier . Well , to France , then . Excuse me , your table 's ready for you now . That 's a real habit you got . What habit is that ? I never seen anyone eat and smoke at the same time . [ gasp ] Where did it go ? If you hear someone scream , that 's probably where it is . Louise , you gotta quit . The tobacco 's ruining your brain . [ laughing ] So you never remarried , and don 't have a girlfriend ? Isn 't that a little unusual ? Is it ? I guess so . I don 't know , sometimes I wish I 'd ... What ? Done things differently , I guess . The job always came first . I know what you mean . That 's how I feel about my job . Really ? But yours doesn 't take you away in the middle of the night , keep you gone for a couple of months ? By the time I got back , my girl had actually gone . Well , maybe you didn 't find the right girl . Maybe . Tom says I 'm burning out . Whatever . I just gave up looking . Took a lot of cold showers . You find it difficult to talk about yourself . That 's all I 've been doing . But you 're right , I can 't . Open up emotionally ? That 's it . I 'm no good at ... Expressing yourself ? I couldn 't-a said it better myself . What about you ? Why aren 't you married ? I can 't have any children . I 'm sorry . But that 's not the only reason to get married . It would be for me . Bill , I 'd like to get out of here . Where are you staying ? I can drive you there . For a minute , I forgot . I haven 't even seen the room yet . I was going to ask you if it 's nice . Well , you could come up and take a look . [ romantic music ] It is nice . At least they delivered my luggage . Compliments of the management . That 's real nice . That is nice . Would you like an apple ? [ sniffs ] [ laughs ] What 's so funny ? I don 't know , you just seem to do everything a little different from everyone else . Is that bad ? I don 't think so . Let 's find out . This may not have been such a good idea . Why not ? You don 't find me attractive ? Nah , it 's not that , I just ... Wait , try it again . Please , I really want this to work . I really need this to work . [ romantic music ] Let me get the light . To hell with the light . There 's a spare toothbrush in there , if that 's what you 're looking for . [ gasps ] I thought you were sleeping . I think I was . Come here . You smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . Just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before . Took me over a year to quit . You don 't believe me ? This is my last cigarette . Damn it , they were supposed to call me . Well , they can 't start 'till you get there . [ sighs ] Bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? Sure , I remember . Maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . Are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . This job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . Why not ? The world 's not gonna come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years , I got one coming . In one week I 'll have this investigation started , and I can hand it over to someone else . Then I 'm gonna take a long look at my life . Maybe we can go away somewhere together . Anyway , we got tonight . I may not be here tonight . [ mysterious music ] Stay with me . [ romantic music ] I can 't . We 'll talk about it tonight . [ device beeps ] Sherman , send the gate . [ whirring and crackling ] [ dramatic music ] Louise ? [ Man on P.A. ] : Gate 's operation is terminated . All controls to zero . Hmm . He 'll never miss it . What happened ? Did you stop him ? Sherman , get my uniform . Paradox , time quake approaching , force seven . [ alarms blaring ] [ rumbling ] I have to talk to the council . We don 't have much time . Here 's what happened after I left . [ Bill ] : ... going over every single piece of wreckage in this hangar . Identify it , tag it . If you don 't know what something is , bring it to me . What is it we 're looking for ? I 'll know it when I see it . We 're gonna reassemble the 747 from the ground up . Bill , are you sure of this ? That 's all . Go to work . He 's forgotten all about what really caused the crash . Now he 's looking for the stunner . And for me . We 're wasting time , Bill . Can 't learn anything from this . Rebuild it . Every inch of it . Day and night , I 'll approve the overtime . Bill , the boss is on the phone from Washington . Tell him I 'll call him back . He says get yourself back there or you 'll be fired . Well , that sounds fairly urgent . You want me to go with you ? I don 't think you 'd better be around me . It might not be good for your career . He 's doing his job badly now . It had to lead to conflict with his superiors . [ Boss ] : Bill , I 've always backed you , because you were a good investigator . I let you run with this even if I couldn 't see the reason , but you 've turned up nothing new . Now , I have to know what you expect to find . If I knew , I wouldn 't have to look so hard for it . This crash has been crazy from the start . Like , the watches that ran backwards . You said that wasn 't important . I didn 't think so . Now I do . And the cockpit tape . The engineer screaming that they 're all dead and burned . Was it computer error , or not ? Yeah . As soon as we get your report saying that , we can recommend getting the new computers . That 's a big appropriation , and Congress is ready to spend the money . [ sighs ] Something happened in the hangar . [ eerie music ] I found something . I think it knocked me out . Then they came and took it from me . Now they 're watching me . I can feel it . They can go anywhere . Look anywhere . There was this girl . [ sighs ] Now he 'll go see Dr. Mayer . Dr. Mayer doesn 't have the answers . But he has one of these . It 's the stunner Susan lost in 1963 . Smith has the initiator . You put them together , and it spells paradox . Come in , Mr. Smith . I 've been expecting you . That 's it , it 's all temporal censorship from there . [ machine shuts off ] That means I will go back . I can still stop the paradox if I leave right now . The watches , the cockpit voice recording , that could be important . It 's hard to tell , but you say she didn 't know you . That 's right , she said I look like my pictures . Then she hadn 't met you yet . I told you , we spent the night together . It was unforgettable . You 're missing the point . She finds you in the hangar on the night of the fifth . She returns to wherever she comes from , then , for reasons of her own , she returns to the fourth and meets you ... for the first time , from her point of view . She 's travelling in time . There has to be another answer . It 's time I showed you something . I 've been working on a puzzle for 25 years . You may be the missing piece . That 's it ! Where 'd you get it ? What is it ? It 's a weapon of some kind . [ Man on P.A ] : All systems green , quadrants interlocked . All systems go . [ Woman on P.A. ] : Two minutes , Baltimore , solo , 1989 , two minutes . All I want to do is find her . I don 't care about anything else . Bill , I think you 'll see her again . How do you know so much about her ? Because of this object . It 's very important . I 've run tests on it over the years . I still don 't know what it 's made of , and we can 't make one in the 20th century . Where 'd you get it ? It was in the wreckage of a 707 that crashed in upstate New York in 1963 . I was on that plane . That can 't be ; the only survivor was a boy named - William Collins . My mother remarried and I took the name . This is incredible . Then you must ... What do you remember ? I don 't think about it much . You must remember something . I don 't remember the crash at all . Before that , people were shouting . Somebody got shot . They found a gun with one shot fired . It was a mental patient , a hijacker . There was this lady . It was her . I remember now . She told me everything would be all right . She knew you 'd survive . But what about her , why didn 't she die in the crash ? She got off some way , but she left this behind . She 'll be wanting it back . After 25 years ? In our time , but in her time , she just lost it yesterday . This is the key , Bill . It 's something that shouldn 't be here . We 're living in her past . If she changes her past , if she creates a paradox , then her world is destroyed . Oh yes , we 'll be seeing more of Louise Baltimore . [ Coventry : Laser beams , prepare for countdown . Time tolls intermittent at six seconds , five , four , three ... I may not make it back . You will be back . ... one . All systems green . [ Woman on P.A. ] : 30 seconds , Baltimore , solo , 1989 , 30 seconds . This came off mine . [ electricity crackles ] You two know too much already , and I don 't have much time , but I 'll try to answer your questions . Dr. Mayer , I 'll have to take that . You take people off planes just before they crash . We replace what we take with dead bodies . I 'm glad you came back . But the relatives identify them . They identify the wrong people . We duplicate them , fingerprints , dental records . We 're very good at what we do . Then you are from the future . About 1000 years . It must be incredible . It must be horrible . It 's awful . We 're all dying . We can make the bodies , but we can 't make the souls . We can 't have children anymore . We steal people from the past to send them somewhere else to start over . To give them a second chance . I have to take that stunner back with me , Dr. Mayer . It could cause a paradox . I 'm going with you . You can 't , Bill . Haven 't you heard anything I said ? You said you were dying . So am I. Bill , the whole race is dying , all of humanity . We 're all gonna die . What matters is now . This moment . I can 't take anything with me that will be missed . No one 's gonna miss me . The stunner , Dr. Mayer , that 's what I came for . I knew I was right . No ! [ electricity crackles ] He 's dead . The paradox has happened . I gotta get outta here . Take me with you . Sherman , send the gate . [ electricity crackling ] Watch that first step . It 's a killer . [ loud rumbling ] [ people screaming ] [ Man on P.A. ] : Paradox , time quake , force infinity . Paradox , time quake , force infinity . [ alarms blaring ] Mr. Smith , I presume . [ dramatic music ] [ explosions ] Come on . [ explosions ] Mayer 's work would have changed the course of history . He wasn 't supposed to die for six years . I tried to stop him . I was too late . It 's all over . The paradox is here . If you had left things alone , none of this would have happened . I did what I had to do . [ Female council member on P.A. ] Our world is at an end . All evidence of our existence will be washed away . We must attempt to send those We have saved into a distant future that may lie beyond the gate . Coventry , reverse the gate . Get out . Get out , everybody get out ! Go , Louise . Get him out of here . [ inspiring music ] [ urgent music ] Open the holding pens . Release everyone and send them to the gate . [ Woman on P.A. ] : You will awake now . Remain calm Remain calm . - Come on ! - Come on , let 's go . [ dramatic music ] [ explosions ] [ electricity crackling ] [ pained moan ] Proceed to the gate as quickly as possible . Proceed in single file to the main terminal . Remain calm . Do not be afraid . Do not be afraid . No harm will come to you . Follow directions . [ explosions ] [ cry of fear ] Walk towards the light , and step into the light . Move along . Move along , everything 's all right . Please remain calm . [ triumphant music ] [ explosions ] [ anguished moans ] Single file , walk into the light . You 'll be all right . Keep movin ' . Single file , walk into the light . Walk towards the light , and step into the light . [ explosions ] [ screaming ] Our work is done . I move we adjourn . Seconded . [ muffled explosions ] Just keep moving , walk through the light . Walk into the light . [ explosions ] Time to go , Bill . [ Man on P.A. ] : The gate will be destroyed in two minutes . What happens when the gate 's gone ? Like a nuclear bomb . [ ethereal whirring ] Step through , Bill . Together . None of us can go , only you . Then I 'm not goin ' , either . Take a chance , Louise . Go with him . You are going to have his child . [ explosions , metal groaning ] The gate will be destroyed in one minute . Sherman , come with us . There is no place for me where you are going . Go , now . [ loud roaring ] [ explosion ] [ Sherman ] : This is not the end . [ peaceful piano music ] This is not the beginning of the end . It is the end of the beginning . [ roaring ]

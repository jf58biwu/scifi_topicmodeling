 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . This is Stan Gruen , Radio P.O. V. I 'm taking calls on the rise in Newcomer population . Hello , you 're on the air . Hi , Stan , this is Phyllis from Granada Hills . - Hello , Phyllis , what 's your beef ? - Well , according to the Census Bureau ... there are now 27 1,400 Newcomers . That 's an increase of 21,000 , more than 8 % ... since they came here almost five years ago . HOST : Those are the figures . PHYLLlS : This supports everything we 've been saying . These creatures breed faster than we do . They adapt more easily . Unless they 're controlled , they will take over this planet . - Phyllis , tell me , are you a Purist ? - Yes , I am , Stan . [ Soft rock music playing ] Your husband is a very lucky man . Are you ready ? Yes . [ Rockin ' Robin playing ] Rock back , step , together . Rock back . Step , together . Rock back . Step , together . Step , together . Rock back . No . The beat , Cathy . The beat . You got to listen to the beat . I 'm sorry , Matt. I was afraid of this . This is why I wanted you just to recommend a dance school . It 's not that hard . Just listen to the beat , okay . Get the rhythm . All right ? Yeah . Okay , let 's try it without the music . What ? Where you 're touching me on my back ... that 's an erogenous zone . - Erogenous . Sexually arousing . - Yeah . - Like the inside of your thigh , or- - - l get it . How do you know about the inside of my thigh ? We 've been studying comparative physiology at ... UCLA . How can I teach you how to dance , if I can 't touch the small of your back ? You can . - Just a little higher . - Higher ? Okay . How 's that ? Good . Okay . Rhythm , right ? All right , okay , and step , together . Rock back . Step , together . Step , together . Rock back . Good . Step , together . Rock back . Step , together . Rock back . [ Rockin ' Robin playing ] Step , together . Rock back . Try a little turn now . Okay ? Here we go . Step , together , and a double . Come here . Step . Cathy , I really think you 're starting to get it here . I feel like I was flying. I really understand why humans love to dance . Would you teach me the cha-cha-cha sometime ? Sure , sometime . Thanks . That was just a way to say thank you . You know , like a little peck on the cheek . Let 's try that turn thing again . All right , let 's go , ladies . Let 's go . [ ln Tenctonese ] I made it strong . That 's the way you like it , right ? Yeah . Thanks . Albert , got those bedroom eyes , you heart-breaker you . All this time , right next to me , the galactic Romeo- - - Sgt . Dobbs , please . - What 's wrong with your eyes ? I 'm embarrassed . That 's how you guys blush ? Your eyes , they change colors ? Yes . Don 't worry about it , man . I 'm sorry. lt 's okay . I didn 't know you were so sensitive . You 're really stuck on her ? Check it out . Don 't worry . Now , we 're pals , right ? Bros ? Your secret is safe with me . Okay ? Thanks , Sgt. Dobbs . Hey , Quintero , you are not gonna believe this ... . - Are you going to eat that or play with it ? - George , let me ask you something . You touch a Newcomer on the small of her back and bingo , fireworks , right ? Um-hmm . What else ? Matt , are you dating a Tenctonese woman ? - l 'm just curious , okay ? - ls it Cathy ? - George . - l like Cathy . - George . - l understand . Bridge of the nose . Shoulder blades . And we 're especially sensitive on the backs of our knees . - Backs of your knees ? - Yes . What about , you know ... . Humans are obsessed with genitalia , we 're not . You guys are so weird . When you see a woman , what do you look for ? What turns you on ? Well , when a woman 's speckles ... flow down her neck onto her back ... and then narrow into a fine , delicate line , that 's ... . Speckles ? Also , the ear valleys ... when they end in a swirling little S-shape . Any more of this , and I 'll need a hot shower . - l think you mean- - - Excuse me , Matt . [ Phone ringing ] Sikes . Sikes . - Albert . - George ... I have thought about it. I just can 't . Albert , it would mean so much to me and to Susan . [ ln Tenctonese ] Please don 't ask me , I am sorry , but I took a vow. l- - George , got a call from dispatch . - What 's with you and Albert ? - lt 's a personal matter . Personal ? is Albert in some kind of trouble ? - lt 's between the two of us . - What ? - Come on , George , I 'm your partner . - What did dispatch say ? We got a 187 . Let 's roll . Man , I 've seen this a million times . Guy 's in bed with another man 's woman . Husband breaks in and blows them both away . That 's a human scenario , Matt . You and your nacho culture . Macho culture , George . Macho . We simply don 't regard our mates with the same kind of male possessiveness . What are you guys ? Hippies from outer space ? Free love ? You always distort and exaggerate . The husband was found unconscious outside . Hey , he probably KO 'ed himself for an alibi . You guys can press a nerve and do that , can 't you ? Or is that Star Trek ? Hey , $ 20 says hubby pulled the trigger . - What the hell is that ? - He 's a Binnaum . - A-- - A Binnaum . The Third One , a catalyst . Oh , yeah , I 've heard about that . I didn 't believe it . A Newcomer woman really needs two men to what- - Fertilize her egg . Yes . The Gannaum , like myself , who provides the sperm ... and the Binnaum , less than 1 % of our male population ... who prepares the channel with a catalyzing emission . Man . We don 't like to talk about it because of human prejudice . As you can see , he 's anatomically different . - Slightly . - Yeah , slightly . The husband was not the murderer . Clearly , he and his wife were trying to have a baby ... and enlisted the help of this Binnaum . Sex with two guys . Tenctonese women really get to party . This is mating to have a child . When a Tenctonese woman makes love , it is with one man . Whatever you say , George . Catalysts perform a ritual based on a biologic need . - They 're like priests . - Not like any priest I know . There are no powder burns on the female victim 's husband or his clothing . He couldn 't have pulled the trigger . And what 's the book on this Bimbom ? Binnaum . No lD . Husband didn 't know him . - He says his wife engaged him . - The husband never even met the guy ? Often the woman makes all the arrangements . After all , it is her body . Hey . I don 't care what you say , this still sounds pretty kinky to me . Two men , one woman . Not normal . It is not normal for you . It is quite normal for us . Come on , it didn 't bother you at all , when you had Buck , when you had Emily ... that another man had sex with your wife ? I treasure the memories . Why do I even try ? Let 's run a tissue-type on that catalyst , find out who the hell he was . What ? There may be an easier way . I do know him , from the order . Tardemma . His Earth name was Polk . James Polk . May I go ? [ ln Tenctonese ] Thank you , Albert . He knew him from " the order " ? What order ? The order of Binnaum , the Third Ones . Albert is a catalyst . Albert ? You 're kidding ? That little guy ? He- - What do you find so funny ? The joy and beauty that is my daughter Emily , I owe to Albert . - Albert ? - Yes . Albert and Susan ? [ Spiritual choral music ] So these Binnaum all live like monks ? They are traditionally sequestered away . Yes . Hail Mary , full of grace . Bin Glenza ? [ ln Tenctonese ] I came to let the Drevni know how sorry I was about James . - Would you tell him ? - Tell him yourself , Bin Glenza . No. I can 't go in there . I renounced my vows. I left the order . - l 'm unclean . - He means spiritually . I know what he means. I took catechism . Cata-what ? Bin Glenza , I know the Drevni would love to see you . - How could he ? - You are still one of his own . This guy we 're seeing , he 's like the chief , the Father Superior , what ? He 's called the " Drevni . " He 's an elder in an order of Binnaum . [ Speaking Tenctonese ] Guy looks hammered . There are approximately 200 catalysts for every 135,000 females . Therefore , each catalyst must serve 600 to 700 women . - 700 ? - You can understand his weariness . - Drevni ? - Yes . - Bin Glenza . - Drevni , I 'm unclean . No . This is a sad day . The death of one of our own is a great sorrow . Please , help yourself . James Polk was a member of your order , is that right ? Until just recently . James left us some weeks ago . Went on a trip ? Moved out ? What ? Bin Tardemma , James , chose a secular life . I warned him that it was a dangerous decision . The Binnaum are crucial to the survival of our species . Without us , and we are few , the Tenctonese cannot reproduce . They are perfect targets , you see ... for those who wish to exterminate the Tenctonese . The human Purists , for example . Bin James made himself vulnerable ... by continuing to practice the role of catalyst ... outside the protection of the order . He paid for it with his life . - The wages of sin . - Sin is a human concept . The beauty of our laws is that they are both spiritual and practical . They were given to us for a reason . When we don 't follow them , there are consequences . Look , did Polk have any relatives , family that we could talk to ? Like so many of the Tenctonese , he was separated from his family ... aboard the slave ship . We really appreciate your help , Your Holiness , sir . - You are a religious man , Sergeant ? - l was raised Catholic . Unless you have more information on Polk , I think we 're finished here . Thank you , Drevni . You have a home here whenever you wish to return . - l didn 't know you were Catholic . - lt was a long time ago . But you no longer practice . Why ? Look , the church never put food on the table , it never paid the rent . And it sure as hell never stopped my old man from hitting my mom . - lt 's supposed to do all that ? - This place gives me the creeps . I don 't blame you for bailing . - Bin Glenza . - Bin Darnan . I missed you . What are you doing here ? Have you come back ? We had business with the Drevni . - This is my friend , Isaac Newton . - Hello . - l 'll be seeing you soon . - How ? - You 're leaving the order ? - Soon. I have to go . Listen , it 's practically the 21st century . Why don 't you use artificial insemination or something ? We could , of course . But our act of procreation would lose all meaning . Oh , man . Hey , Albert , you with us ? Hey , yo , Al ? Hey , George , how come you didn 't pick a Bimbom with a little more upstairs ? Albert has many fine qualities . Besides , Binnaum do not contribute genetically to the child . Albert , just a sec . 700 women ? Really ? Every year . Tell me , how do you keep it ... . How do you keep going ? I eat a lot of raw pancreas . Raw pancreas ? Yeah , thanks for the tip . - Thanks , I 'd love to . - What ? I said I 'd love to . Love to what ? Go to the movies . You asked me to go to the movies . No. I didn 't send this . - But it says- - - l didn 't send it. lt wasn 't me . Sorry . Hey . Why didn 't you go out with her , Romeo ? You want to , huh ? You sent that note , didn 't you ? Albert , I 'm trying to help you . You shouldn 't have done that , Sgt. Dobbs . You should not have done that . Did you speak to Albert ? Yes . He won 't catalyze our next child . Oh , George , Albert is such a part of our family . He vowed when he left the order that he would no longer practice . - He won 't break that vow . - No , we can 't ask him to . We 'll find someone . Today , I visited Albert 's old order . - l met the Drevni . He 's seems very kind . - Why were you there ? - A Binnaum was murdered . - A Binnaum ? - Who would do this ? Why ? - We don 't know . - lt 's the Purists . - You can 't assume that . All this talk about the census , about controlling our population . I read today that some of them want to sterilize us . If they kill the Binnaum , George ... . lt 's what our people have always feared . Susan , this is one murder . It 's a terrible thing , but it 's hardly genocide . How can you be so sure ? Our people are not in danger . We will continue to flourish here . And we will have another child . Of Newcomer homicides during the last two years , three were catalysts . And all three of these homicides unsolved . I didn 't hear you knock . Cursory inquiry , superficial analyses of evidence , little or no follow-up . - Why ? - Francisco , let me draw you a picture . See this ? When people have this and get killed ... there 's a big investigation . When people don 't have this and get killed , there 's a little investigation . - And that is your answer ? - Look , Francisco , I didn 't make the rules . We 're short on personnel . We 're short on resources . We 're forced to make priorities . These victims had no money , no family . There was no one out there to give a damn . Okay ? Hey , George , can you talk to Albert for me ? He won 't listen to me . Maybe he 'll listen to you . - See , I was trying to set him up . - Set him up ? With the sandwich girl. I didn 't expect him to take it so seriously . You have to understand Albert 's background . He 's been very sheltered . - l know , but to quit his job ? - Quit ? Albert 's quitting ? It was wrong for me to leave the monastery. I am going back . - Why ? - l don 't belong here . I wanted a life like everyone else , but I am different . I 'll never be what they call a " regular guy . " - Regular guy ? - A guy with a girl . I have coupled thousands of times , but I have no girl . I can 't even talk to them . I 'm a freak. I don 't belong here . There is good in this . Tell Susan I will be the Binnaum of your child . - Hey , Albert . How 's it going ? - Excuse me , Officer Sikes . What 's with Albert ? Or is it too personal ? Albert 's quitting his job to return to the monastery . Too bad . Can 't blame him , though . 700 women . You don 't get that kind of action around a cop shop . You know , your lewd innuendo is grossly inappropriate . Well , that 's me , Mr. Grossly inappropriate . Would you like me to make jokes about your Virgin Mary giving birth ? - Now , that has comedic possibilities . - Hey , watch it . - So , this Mary says to this Joseph- - - lt 's not the same thing . Yes , it is . Stop looking at us with your prurient human eyes . Here . Some good news . sid picked up some prints ... from that shell casing we found at the scene . Our perp 's a human named Craig Keller . Long record . Skinhead , known Purist , but a loner . Psychiatric evaluation : " Aggressive , easily-threatened , homicidal . " A first-rate psychopath . Let 's pick him up . MATT : Keller , it 's the police . [ Gun cocking ] Matt ! We hit him ? - l don 't hear any breathing . - Cover me . Rejoice . What was lost is found . [ ln Tenctonese ] Dress yourself in our robes . Eat with us at our table . [ ln Tenctonese ] We are happy to have you back , Bin Glenza . This guy , Keller , subscribes to every Purist rag in the country . Hey , George , did you know your people have the President ... the Congress , and the entire Pentagon under mind control ? - No , I didn 't know that . - lt 's right here . Matt , when you were a boy , were your parents Catholic ? Of course they were Catholic . What do you care ? As slaves , we were denied our culture . Tradition and ritual are so important . I 'm curious why you would freely choose to abandon your religion . Religion ? You know what religion 's about ? Getting people to do what you want . You tell them if they follow the rules , when they die , they get this big reward . Couldn 't it mean something else ? Could religion be an ideal ? Something to aspire to ? George , what are we talking about this for ? Can 't we just do our job ? Hey . The name Isaac Newton . That ring a bell ? Albert 's friend . The Binnaum we met at the monastery . There 's an address here . - Freeze . - Don 't . It 's all right , Isaac . You can come out . What the hell happened to my desk ? - Well , it needed cleaning , so I cleaned it . - Hey . - Nobody is to touch my desk . - Well , I am the janitor . Albert , the guy before you , he never touched my desk . Well , that could be . But the Captain , he says he wants things shipshape . - Where 's my coffee cup ? - l threw the damn thing out . - You threw it out ? - Well , it was broken . - Well , Albert , he fixed it . - Well , it had cracks . They fill with germs , then you drink the coffee ... and those germs go in your stomach , and you get sick , for sure . So I threw it out . He threw out my coffee cup . Albert fixed it . He threw it out . Matt , Sgt. Dobbs , would you join me in Capt. Grazer 's office ? - Why ? What 's up ? - All will be revealed . - Gentlemen . - What 's this about , Francisco ? By the way , congratulations to you and your partner on last night 's collar . - Thank you , Bryon . - l am pleased ... proud , and honored , gentlemen ... to invite you to my house tonight for the Presentation of the Binnaum . The Presentation of the Binnaum . Yeah , we heard you . What 's the " Presentation of the Binnaum " ? Susan and I have decided to have another child . We are inviting our friends over to meet our offspring 's Binnaum . As the Gannaum , I must invite three male friends ... who are important to the livelihood of my family . Gentlemen , I have selected you . - That 's swell , Francisco , but- - - l have brought seeds for each of you . You are to put these in your pockets in preparation for tonight 's ceremony . Really , we are honored . But tonight won 't work for me . I 've got ballet tickets . Yeah , me , too . I 've got tickets for the ballet . Well , then , we 'll just reschedule for tomorrow night . Tomorrow ? That won 't work for me , either . Let 's just find a day that is good for all of us . Let 's see . How about- - What the Captain is trying to say is that ... he , Dobbs , and I , would be honored to be there tonight . Right ? I mean , George is our bro . At the bris for Goldberg 's kid , when Macken 's daughter had her confirmation . When you , Dobbs , were married , weren 't we all there ? Isn 't this just as important ? Yeah . Okay , Francisco . Count me in . Yeah , sure . Me , too . Thank you . Susan will be so pleased . Ballet tickets ? Look , Sikes , they 're just going to introduce this catalyst . - We don 't have to watch anything , do we ? - That 's tomorrow night . Welcome , everyone . Thank you so much for sharing this moment with us . [ ln Tenctonese ] We now collect the seeds , and we mix them together . - Are you having a good time ? - Yeah . Great , George . I know I got it somewhere , George . Here . - Hello , I 'm Cathy Frankel . - Welcome . - Look who 's here . - George . I thought you 'd be pleased . - Hi , Matt . - Hi . At this time , we are honored and pleased to present the Third One ... who has blessed us by consenting to be the Binnaum of our next child . Bin Glenza Mantwea . It 's Albert . That 's what they were up to . Hey , Albert . - Looking good , Albert . - l miss you , Sgt. Dobbs . Yeah . It 's time now . - Capt . Grazer ? - Yes . As the head of George 's workplace , you have an honored position here . Really ? Hi . Hello . Welcome . So , what do you want me to do ? - You wash the Binnaum 's feet . - What ? Albert , you wash Albert 's feet . His what ? It 's better if you kneel . Isn 't it beautiful ? I 've never seen anything so beautiful in my life . Bryon , I was wondering , could you , you know ... . Sikes , get down to the morgue . Francisco 's waiting . You 've got a body . What 's up ? Isaac Newton , the Binnaum we saved . Murdered . You want a lawyer down here ? Who hit Isaac Newton ? I don 't have to answer your questions . I 'm a prisoner of war . Prisoner of war ? What war ? A holy war . For the purity of my species . I demand you abide by the Geneva Convention . Okay , I got your Geneva Convention . Who the hell are you working with ? Come on , Keller , it 's not too late to plea bargain . Who 's your accomplice ? - God . - Get him the hell out of here . Guy 's working with about half a deck , if that . Matt , the M.O. on Isaac Newton ... is very different from Polk and the other catalysts ... we suspect Keller of murdering . Keller would kick open a door , then fire a 12-gauge , pump action shotgun . Newton 's door was intact , and he died from multiple stab wounds . So Keller had a Purist friend who preferred knives to guns . - Perhaps . - You don 't see a connection ? Come on . They were all catalysts . Keller was gonna hit Newton . We know that . Yes , there is a connection , but something is missing in the equation . It 's right here . We just have to find it . We have to cross-reference every detail from all four homicides . We 'll find the thread . Drevni . Come in , Bin Glenza . You are not whole . I see two of you before me ... a Binnaum and a man . They cannot live together . You must put away the man . I 'm leaving , Drevni . The battle is not over , Bin Glenza . I will help you . I miss my friends , my job . I want to live as an ordinary person , to be a part of the world . You are different from this world , Bin Glenza ... from the humans and from your own kind . Then I have to work harder . I have to learn . - l want a life . - You want you . What about our people ? Their need for tradition , for identity ? - l can 't live for them . - Then what about Celine and Andarko ? Their law of the Binnaum ? That extends to this world , and it is above your wants or mine . There are some who say that the law was written by our people . - Not by Celine and Andarko . - The law is Celine and Andarko . It defines us as their children . If you leave , Bin Glenza , that is your choice . But you must not break the law . You must not couple . - Just once , Drevni . - l can 't allow it . I promised George . He 's my friend. I 'm sorry . I fear this world , what it will do to us . Sometimes I think it was better when we were slaves . We knew who we were . We knew what was right . All this freedom . What a terrible thing . - You 're back . - This is from me . - The movies ? - l 'd like you to go with me . - Sure . - Then it 's a date . We have a date , you 're my date . I gotta get back to work . Sgt. Dobbs ... you 'd be proud of me . Hey , look , my waste paper basket is full , and the floor is a mess . - Do you work here or what ? - l bought this for you . George ... I need to leave early . I have to prepare your house . It 's all right , Albert . Will you be coming to the coupling tonight , Matthew ? - Yes , of course he 's coming . - Good . Both Dobbs and Grazer have to visit their mothers in the hospital . What a coincidence . Yeah , we got something , George . Newton was murdered in a residential hotel . He 'd recently left the monastery . All the murdered catalysts ... Polk , the other two , they 'd renounced their vows and left the order . That supports what the Drevni said . It 's dangerous for Binnaum outside the protection of the monastery . George , don 't you get it ? How could Keller know who was a catalyst ? They don 't advertise , and how could he know where to find them ? Somebody at the monastery must have told him . A Binnaum working with a homicidal Purist ? Somebody had to tell him . And after we busted Keller ... that same person from the monastery killed Newton . Matt , Binnaum are crucial to the survival of my people . - Why would they kill each other ? - A guess , George ? The wages of sin . - What do you want here ? - We 've come to see the Drevni . - That is not possible . - Wanna bet ? - Where is he ? - l don 't know . - That is our Drevni 's business . - A Drevni never leaves the monastery . Are you , Gannaum , going to teach the law to our Drevni ? George , all the victims had renounced their vows . But there 's something else . They were still practicing outside the order . Yes , and ? Well , according to the Drevni , they 're breaking the law . I don 't know about you , but on our planet ... there 's a long history of the church killing heretics . Albert . Susan , I 've prepared your bath with the herbs of Celine . Thank you , Albert . Put on the robe when you 're done . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] Drevni . This sacrilege will not happen . I made a promise to a friend . Bin Glenza , listen to your ancestors . Listen to the universe . I listen to my hearts . [ ln Tenctonese ] - Freeze . - Don 't shoot him . Get the knife . Don 't hurt him . Don 't hurt him . Albert , you okay ? You tell the Purists to kill Binnaum , and you kill them yourself . - Why ? - l keep the faith . This is our existence , our life . There are more important things than life . I 've heard that before . You find guys like this in every religion . You don 't buy their party line and you 're out . They burn books . Hell , they even burn people . All in the name of what they call God . Now why is that ? Out of all that love and hope , all you can come up with is hate . Matt , this is supposed to be a night of joy . George , how can you go through with this after what happened today ? This Drevni , this great spiritual leader of yours , he 's nothing but a murderer . You give him too much power . What we have here can 't be diminished by the acts of one person . The infinite remains , the ideal remains . The one voice . Excuse me . [ ln Tenctonese ] - Everybody , please . - All right . - Hello , Matt . - Hi . - Don 't worry , I 'll talk you through this . - Thanks . [ Spiritual choral music ] - lsn 't she beautiful ? - Yeah . [ ln Tenctonese ] [ All replying in Tenctonese ] Okay . [ ln Tenctonese ] Gather round . Turn away . Join together . Close your eyes . [ ln Tenctonese ] Or as my human friends would say , " Eat , drink , and be merry . " - lt was beautiful . - Albert . - Thank you . - Thank you . Just like an Irish wedding . - Are you hungry ? - Yeah . - Would you like something to eat ? - Wait . Tomorrow night , cha-cha-cha .

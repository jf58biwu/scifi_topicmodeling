 The Cosmos : a universe of good and evil where a small group struggles to bring freedom to the countless worlds of despair . A rag-tag band led by the infamous Captain EO . This planet doesn 't look so dangerous , Idy . Is this it , Ody ? - We 'll see . - Ohh . We better find that landing beacon . Hey , Hooter , we 're almost there ! Oh , boy ! Don 't get too close or you 'll trip their intrusion alarm . Yeah , don 't blow it you guys . - Relax , there 's no problem . - No problem . INTRUSION ALERT ! - Battle alert ! - Battle alert ! Don 't panic ! That 's what got us into trouble the last time . - It wasn 't our fault . It was Hooter 's fault . - Right , Hooter 's fault . Oh , Hooter ! Straighten up men . It 's the Captain . Good morning , Captain . It looks like we tripped their intrusion alarm , sir . Idy and Ody blew it . They got too close . We 're goin ' in . Sir , the ship is in absolutely no condition to go into battle . I thought we 'd begin by cleaning up Hooter 's bunk . Hooter ! Listen ! The Command considers us a bunch of losers . But we 're gonna do it right this time , 'cause we 're the best . We don 't we 'll be drummed out of the corps . We won 't let you down this time , sir . - We 're going to do it right . - That 's right , we 'll be perfect , sir . OK . - Captain , there 's something weird out there . - A patrol ship . I thought so . Maybe we can outrun him . - It 's going to ram us ! - Duck ! Get to your stations ! - Hold on , everybody , hold on ! - We haven 't found the landing beacon yet . Somebody get the map . Where 's the map ? ! - Who 's got the map ? - Fuzzball . Hooter has it . - Hooter has it ! - Hooter ! - I think I ate it ! - You ate it ? ! Captain EO ! Captain EO ! Commander Bog . Captain EO , you are late reporting in . Are you having a problem finding our landing beacon ? No , sir . Everything 's under control , sir ! What 's going on ? We 're having a slight thruster malfunction , sir . Captain EO , have you engaged in combat against orders ? ! I can 't see ! Captain EO , what 's going on ? - Going through . - No ! Idy , the sail 's not in . - Hooter , bring in the sail ! - OK . - It 's right behind you , Hooter . - I can 't reach it . What 's going on ? Somebody push the red button . Use your trunk , Hooter . Come on , Hooter . Stretch ! Woo ! We 're losing power . Everybody hold on ! Captain EO ? Captain EO ? ! I think we found the beacon . Captain EO , take a look at this . The homing beacon . We ran right into it ! - Commander Bog ! - Captain EO ? Everything 's OK , sir . - Right on time . - And we 've reached the homing beacon , sir . Well , so far , so good , Captain EO . But , I must admit that I am a bit surprised after the mess you made of your last mission . But now that you 've found the beacon , take the map , find the Supreme Leader and give her the gift . You do have the map , don 't you ? - No problem . - No problem , sir . - Right here . Then get going ! - Boy , do we have a problem . - We 'll never find the Supreme leader without a map . Come on . - I couldn 't help it . - Quiet . - Hooter . - I 'm disguising myself . Hooter , listen . Put it back and let 's go . - Don 't be silly . - Gotta have a disguise . - Shh ! - Sorry . Get them ! Who is it ? The Supreme Leader . Hey , I told you I 'd find her . Silence ! Infidel ! Infidel ? You infect my world with your presence . Turn the others into trash cans ! - See you later trash can ! - And for him 100 years of torture in my deepest dungeon . Your highness , my loyal companions and I accept these punishments . - We do ? - Of course we do , he 's our captain . I speak for myself . We have come here uninvited and unannounced . So , then we both admit to your stupidity ! Why have you come ? To bring a gift , your highness . To someone as beautiful as you . You think me beautiful ? Very beautiful within , your highness , but without a key to unlock it . And that is my gift to you . So , let me see this gift . Not only see , your highness , but hear . - Hooter , hurry up ! - Come on , Hooter . - Over here . - No . Send in my troops ! I got it , I got it ! Hooter ! Hurry up and fix it , Hooter ! Send him to my dungeon ! Hooter ! I got it ! Get him ! Woo ! We 're on a mission in the everlasting light that shines . A revelation of the truth and chapters of our minds . So long , bad times . We 're gonna shake it up . Break it up . We 're sharing light brighter than the sun . Hello , good times . We 're here to stimulate , eliminate , an ' congregate , illuminate .

[ Woman 's voice ] Reports have been coming in of a major fire at the Metro Tax Bureau . It looks like this was a deliberate fire started by the same arsonist who has put a torch to several city institutions recently . A note claimed he was all heated up over the new TV tax . Metropolice have been tracking a suspect who they believe may have started the fire . They lost him about 20 minutes ago in the crowd of spectators leaving tonight 's scumball game . It appears the Bureau Burner is still at large . [ Edison ] We were so close . Look , what did you expect me to do ? Murray set us down on the wrong street . I know , okay ? I know . Any word ? Bureau Burner is still at large . That I know already . What about Theora ? She 's off the show effective immediately . We can discuss that after I 've had a chance to talk to her . Yeah ? What 's to discuss ? A controller abandons her post while her operative is still out in the field . That 's automatic grounds for suspension . Come on . You know that . I want to hear her side of it . Where is she , Murray ? How the hell should I know ? She 's not at home . I 've tried to reach her there repeatedly . Well , something must really be wrong . Yeah , you bet there is . We still don 't have our feature story for this week 's show . Now , you go home , you get a few hours ' rest , and you get back in here by 6 a.m. tomorrow . I will have a replacement- - I don 't want a replacement ! I 'm going to go find Theora ! Hey , what , you don 't hear me ? We don 't have time for you to go on a manhunt- - a womanhunt , whatever ! Even if you find her , I don 't want her back . I do . Uhh ... uh , the last time this happened , he ended up bruised . Now I feel- - Now I feel like that guy with the guns . No one could touch him . [ laughing ] [ parrot squawks ] Edison , I want to talk to you about that maniac-ac-ac-ac gun man who 's on the loose tonight . Have there been any casualties ? Some other time , Max . And no , there haven 't . W-W-What 's he for , then ? Bryce . Bryce ! I need total environmental and intersystem playback of Theora at her station in this last hour . You think you can call that up for me ? That 's hardly in my department . Besides , I 'm very busy . I 'm very immersed in some deeply important work . Bryce ! Theora 's missing . See , she 's disappeared . It 's not like her . I want to try and pinpoint when she was last at her station . The rolling databank will give you whatever you need . Sure , they will , if I fill out their endless forms and give them an in-depth confession on why I want access . - Newsr- - - Uh- - Newsroom surveillance tapes of a controller 's output are high security confidential . They 're very sensitive about giving out any of that information . [ twittering ] [ scrolling ] [ beeping ] How did this happen ? - [ Bryce ] Max . - [ giggling ] You may not realize that here in the Fringes , people eat what they can catch , and the prime source of food has been- - - Fast forward . - ... has been rats . Bring up Theora 's vidiphone screen . Theora . It 's Winnie . Winnie , why on earth are you calling me ? Shawn didn 't want me to , but I- - I didn 't know who else to call . Hold on a second . - Okay , now what is it ? - Winnie . Shawn is in trouble- - Bryce , get me Theora 's personnel file , will you ? - [ Winnie ] ... what to do . - [ Theora ] Where is he ? It 's even more sensitive than the output tapes . You didn 't give me the output tapes , did you ? [ groan ] I didn 't know Theora had a brother . Neither did I. Hard copy . Thanks , Bryce , you little troublemaker . He never thinks-ks-ks-ks . I mean , why is he trying to find Theora ? I guess it 's because he 's fond of her . Is fo-fo-fo-fo- - Is fond the same as fondle- - fondle ? How should I know ? [ chatter ] Excuse me . - Excuse me . - Hmm ? I 'm looking for my brother Shawn Jones . I understand he works here . Jones . Oh , Jones . Fired him a week ago . You fired him ? Why ? Well , you 're his sister . You tell me . Always sick , always late . Bad boy . No family resemblance . We don 't hang out together . Well , me , neither . Him always off raking . Raking ? What is raking ? - No idea . - I 'm trying to f- - - [ gong sounds ] - [ Asian accent ] Hello . Edison , what are you doing here ? I 've been on your trail for over an hour . Can 't I at least buy you a drink ? No , thanks . [ Woman 's voice ] Good evening , Mr. Carter . What would you like to drink ? I 'll have a scotch with ice , and she 'll have a blizzard . One scotch with ice , one blizzard coming up . I don 't want a drink , thanks . We are testy . I just don 't want a drink . Murray 's not very happy . To hell with Murray . We had some excitement after you left . Uh ... We had a chance at the Bureau Burner . At least we think it was the Bureau Burner , anyway . Unfortunately , I had Murray sitting in as my controller . I suppose the next thing you 're going to tell me is I 've been fired . Murray seems to think so , yeah . But I don 't . Listen , whatever it is- - Oh , spare me , Edison , please . Look , I really don 't need your help . You 'll find another ace controller , so just forget it . Look at me . If you think that 's the only reason I 'm here , you 're very wrong . How come you never mentioned you had a brother ? There are lots of things I 've never mentioned about myself . 12 years spent in state homes cures you of any need to think back on the good old days . - Anyway- - - Yes , quickly , Mr. Peller . You know I 've been discussing this rake board legislation for several months now . You are going to help us get it pushed through , aren 't you ? I 'm working on it , Jack . Really I am . But you know how slow the decision-making process can be . I 'm spending lots of time with my colleagues on the legislature . Zik-Zak will be investing substantial sums of money in the marketing and promotion of this game , Mr. Peller . My brother and I were separated . I suppose people are more likely to adopt pretty young girls . Anyway , I got lucky , and he didn 't . He 's never forgive me for leaving him . He wants nothing to do with me . Is he in some kind of trouble ? I heard the word raking . Don 't play reporter with me , Edison . It 's something everyone knows about but no one talks about . Look , it 's not your problem . And I really don 't need any help in taking care of my brother , thank you . [ Man ] You 'll love it , Mr. Peller . When we do get it legalized , well , there 's big pickings in raking . I want ratings , not a beeper . Yes , well , um , I feel there might be a way to have your little sport legalized sooner rather than later . Uh , w-when was it that you said you needed official sanctioning by ? [ cannons booming ] Murray . Murray . Murray ! Have I got a story for you-ou-ou . Forget about that mad bomber jazz and listen up . there 's a guy with a gun running amok-mok-mok-mok every afternoon . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Max , but that 's Missile Mike . It 's one of our children 's shows . You 're kidding . The kids like kil-kil-kil-killing ? Who told them about it ? I 'm never going to get used to this . Just because he lives in the TV , he thinks everything is TV . Any word on Theora ? All right , go back to your station . Wel-Wel-Wel-Well , nobody wanted it , so here it is anyway . This is Max Headroom , live on Net-Net-Net-Network 23 , because what I want to know is who 's gonna stop this kind of wholesale killing-ing-ing-ing- - killing ? It 's time the network took a stand- - a stand- - a stand on this kind of murder- - murder- - murder . Preferably against it . As you 've just seen , Max has announced our determination to cancel several antisocial programs . And their profits , too ? Which are , according to my projections , certain to decline in the near future , especially when compared to the potential up side of the strong new program which Jack Friday of Sports is about to present . Miss Formby ? Seems that we have a new and exciting race game called raking . And if Jack Friday 's right , we may have the biggest thing since scumball . These pictures are from a video cube bootleg which has been circulating the city . The figures are astounding . If they 're to be believed , it 's becoming a big money sport , and the side betting is prodigious . We should franchise the betting ourselves . Have an exclusive terminal nest at all the tracks . It 's a great idea , huh , Ben ? Groundbreaking as ever , Ashwell . The origin of the game came from the kids crudely motorizing their skateboards . Accidents and collisions became part of the macho style . Youthful pugnacity . This has now been refined as aggression . Thank you . Hopefully , Jack Friday will have some good news for us . He 's introduced the sport to Ped Xing of the Zik-Zak Corporation . Now , if he sees a potential , they 'll build a series of tracks and launch the sport officially , and we will have exclusive worldwide rights to the game . - [ ding ] - Yes ? Mr. Friday , head of Sport , is here now , sir . Oh , uh , put him on the big screen . I 'm pleased to announce that we have done it . We have raking . We are in . We , all of us , are on the verge of a brand-new era in sports- - the era of raking . Raking . [ Ben ] Bravo . [ Miss Formby ] Till then . You know , Murray 's looking for you . He 's a bit ticked off . I have more important things to worry about than Murray 's temper . My brother 's in trouble . [ static ] Did you-d you-d you see my broadcast ? I sense a pr-pr-pr-problem here . Why the long face ? Hmm ? Hmm ? I think I lost my brother . Have you ch-ch-ch-checked your pockets ? Max , it 's not funny . Sorry . Sorry . Is there anything I can do to help ? I mean , I mean , what do men do when ladies are in distress - stress-stress-stress ? " Run away or boast , normally . I wonder what Edison would do . He would be , A , concerned ... B , anxious ... C , distressed ... and D , sorry . Yeah . He would also interfere . [ chatter ] He 's taking a nap . I 'd like to talk to him . I said he 's taking a nap . Now , do you want to move along ? Well , I feel certain he 'd talk to me if he wasn 't taking a nap , but if he is taking a nap , then I wouldn 't want to wake him ! You 'll have to forgive Grace . This week she 's a bodyguard , but she does have her moments . Have a seat . What 'll it be ? Information . What do you know about rake boards and ... raking ? What 's to know ? What happens ? It 's a rebel game . Kids racing . - Where ? - In the All Clear Patch . What aren 't you telling me ? What aren 't you asking me ? All right . I have a friend . She 's worried . Her brother 's into it . So why should that be a problem ? A good friend ? Yeah . The kid 's in trouble . Raking is brutal . The punters bet on survivors , not winners . You get me ? Yeah , I 'm beginning to . Can you take me to a raking session ? They 're elementally heavy on security . Emphasis on the heavy . We 'll need a guide- - some kid that knows the score . Gracie . Don 't do anybody I wouldn 't do . See you for tea . You 're amazing , Grace . [ Man on TV ] The space shuttle Leviathan got off to a good start today . Over 60 shuttles are now in Earth orbit , and passengers have pledged over 184 million units toward the privatization of the global satellite- - Um ... how 'd you like some junkyard delicacy ? I just lost my appetite . [ laughing ] Hey , we got a rake board kid up on the platform . - Let 's go . - You got it . Where 'd he go , Rik ? You see him ? I 'm keeping my eyes on the road . You keep your on the kid . [ Rik ] Do you see the little beast ? No , I can hear him , though . Edison , I have him . Turn left . Rik , we got to take a left up here . Let 's go . Nice to have you back . Who says I 'm back ? Okay , take the next right . He 's gone inside a warehouse . [ Edison ] Got it . - [ Max ] - Huh ? Oh , it 's you again . What-What-What ? We 're old friends . Raking . What 's it all about ? Raking ? It 's about survival , and that 's all I know . You know enough . Thanks-ks-ks-ks-ks-ks , old friend . [ Theora ] He 's coming out again . To your left . Here he comes , Edison . Huhn ! You okay ? How did you cut me off like that ? We got friends in high places . Oh , Murray , Edison has a lead for the show this week . Uh , I 'll let him explain . Edison , Murray 's here . I 've told him you have a lead for our feature story this week . Can you give him the angle , please ? - Go ahead . - Raking . It 's called a sport . In fact , it 's a vicious exploitation of kids who are encouraged to hurt each other for the pleasure of the audience . All right . Let 's run with it . Edison , yes , Murray has given us his blessing , - so to speak . - Us ? Yes , us . I was worried . Okay . Now tell me the truth . Is my brother in there ? Yeah . I 'm afraid he is . Help him , Edison . [ Theora ] The rake house seems deserted . There doesn 't seem to be any security . You 're going to have to get inside . I 'm scanning now . The kid said that Rake-off is where they 'll be raking tonight . All right , let 's go . Hold on , Edison . Someone moving . So how 's the kid that got raked ? Ace or Shawn or whatever his name is . He 's very weak . I can 't guarantee he 'll stay up . Well , can you fix him so he looks good ? Sure , sure , but not to stay good . Ehh . You shouldn 't smoke in training . [ coughing ] Hey . There he is . That 's him . We can loud-mouth him to win , and we 'll put just a little side bet on the other guy . Hi , there , Shawn . How you doing ? I 'm fine . Look . I 'm fine . I 'll go for it , sir . I 'll rake him for you . Ah . What spirit , eh , Dusty ? You 're one of raking 's finest . [ sigh ] What do you want to know now ? I want to know how to get into that rake track . [ laughing ] Let 's see . Thanks . Theora , we 're going in , so stay on me , okay ? Shawn 's in there , isn 't he ? Yeah , I think so . I see . Rik , well , well . This is a bit out of your territory . Ha . Territory yourself . I heard there 's a rake going on tonight . Can you slide me in ? Sure , Rik . There 's the door . - Mm-hmm . - You bump into the doc , tell him you know me . Yeah . I 'll tell him I know you . My , oh , my , what a fascinating little gathering . Theora , get Murray . [ Murray ] I 'm , uh , I 'm here . Peller . Now that 's what I call news . All right , stay on it , Edison . - I 'm going to get Cheviot . - Okay . [ Announcer ] Once again , right here , ladies and gentlemen- - Straight rake-out in five rolls on Ace- - Ace . That 's hot from the top . Got it from him up there . How you doing , boy ? I 'm all right . That 's not good enough . You got to be great . You got the little lady at home and what she can do with the money . Go get ' em ! [ motors revving up ] [ Announcer ] And there 's the flag ! [ cheering ] Come on . - Aah ! - He 's down ! No ! It was deliberate . I 'm going down . Get up . Get up . Get up ! Ah . Good timing . Novo Zurich confirms Zik-Zak has transferred the funds into our accounts . So it seems our presence is no longer required here . Yeah . They 're Network 23 's problem now . Yeah . Ha ha ha ha . Doc . Oh . [ TV sputters ] [ Max ] Hey . Psst . You look- - You look- - You look- - You look like the man in charge . I 'm looking for a new game- - som-som-som-som-something with action , excitement , and taste- - taste- - the taste ... of blood . Any ideas ? He 's injured , Joe . That kid 's in trouble , man . Unbelievable . Aah ! Legalize this ? Why , you must be mad ! [ Announcer ] Ladies and gentlemen , Ace ! Come on , Edison , move ! - The kid 's hurt down there . - [ audience booing ] it 's okay . We got you . Take it easy . Take it easy . - Damn you ! - Take it easy . - We got to get out of here . - Get out of my face ! Hey . H-H-Hey . That game- - You know , with the blood .

[ Rik ] I think you 're about to die . Worse yet , I can 't transmit . The set . Get the set ! Watch this . Theora . I hear you . Access the two-way sampler and fast . Okay . Why ? Do it ! Uh , try Cheviot CT0011 . You set a time , rat ! Good Lord , that 's Jack Friday and Peller , and they 're fighting . Okay , we have it , Edison . You set a time , rat ! [ arguing ] Come on , Max , my man . I just connected . Edison needs you to tell the world about raking . - Sorry about this . - [ glass shatters ] Ah . Ah . Didn 't feel a thing . Ed-Ed-Ed-Edison ! Now what ? [ Edison ] Take it away , Max ! It 's all yours ! This is Max-Max-Max-Max Headroom live and direct , sitting in for Edison Carter . We 're here in the middle of a rake track , a sport- - a sport- - a sport- - a sport which maliciously exploits young kids who would rather be watching the unlikely exploits of Missile Mike . But , as a famous personality once said- - I think it was me- - enough- - enough of Mis- - enough of Missile Mike . So- - So over to Edison Carter . [ Edison ] I am speaking to you live and direct- - I 've never seen myself on TV before . But I suppose you get used to it . [ chuckle ] Yeah . Eventually . [ baby cries ] [ Edison on TV ] ... exploitation of young men . You ever get used to the sound of babies ? [ Edison on TV ] This is a dangerous- - Hey , little brother , come on , it 's your turn . [ Edison on TV ] ... supporters , but which arms them with sharp-gloved weapons . The winner 's the one who cuts down his opponent . This is a secret , illegal , underground game run by small-time mobsters . They have taken a game that was once performed by skilled kids for fun and turned it into a gory spectacle , - and one which Network 23- - - Thanks , Edison . ... itself was almost party to . I mean it . Now this story can be told . [ Winnie ] Aunt Theora . You should settle down and have a baby . - Shouldn 't she , Shawn ? - [ baby continues crying ] Shouldn 't she , Edison ? Practice could make something perfect . And-And-And I 'm going to be back with you on Network 23 after these real-real-real- - really exciting messages . So-So sit back and watch . I just can 't wait-wait-w-wait to see them . [ giggling ] Huh . Wake me up when they 're finished , will you ? Hi . This is M-M-M-Max Headroom on Network 23 , and if you thought raking was a vicious game , let me tell you , there are sponsors who 'd give both-both arms to get their hands on that sport . But , in a lighter vein , here are some really sporting off-off-offers on sale now from Network 23 . Yes- - music ! Mu-Mu-Music ! Sit back and tap your feet to the best Russian pop music with this really up-to-the-minute Rus-ss-ssian album- - 20 Great Funeral Marches ! Also- - Also-Al-Al-Also , an offer- - learn Chinese . Yes . A complete set of hour-long Teach Yourself Chinese tapes . One payment down , and we will send you one tape per month , or- - or pay in full now , and you get the entire easy-to-follow course immediately , plus tape number 527 absolutely free ! Because did you know that , in Chinese , there are often more than 30-30-30 different ways of saying one simple little word ? And is that why their population is so big ? Chinese men just don 't know when to take No- - Ha ! - - No for an answer ! Ha ha ! Yeah , but body banks are for dead people . [ Announcer ] Next on Max Headroom ... The client wants her alive and fresh . Aah ! - Uhhn ! - Aah ! You took a girl to a body bank today . I think you 've stumbled on something very nasty . Max , please help me . Asking is just polite de-de-demanding . You want me to choose between a girl 's life and a job ? The loudest sound in the universe is the last heartbeat .

 On the planet Gyllenblå peace and order prevails under president Ratio Rasch . He doesn 't rule by force of arms , but through a simple and ingenious method . He has forbidden people to laugh . In this way , they have become his obedient tools . The police 's sole mission is to listen for the remnants of the hated laughter . You know how easy it becomes contagious ... Yes you , Epicycle , This looks pretty good . That 's one year that you have been here in reason treatment . It feels more like 25 ... Yes , a year can be a long time . It depends on how corrupted one is . - What do you think Nurse ? - Well then , we 've come a long way . You believed in a God ... Do you still ? No . - It 's just superstition . - Yes , it was unreasonable . - What do you believe in , then ? - In reason . And what represents the highest reason ? - The President . - Ratio Rasch ! Yes , Epicycle , it looks as if we could sign you out . - But we should do a test . - Nurse . - Yes , doctor . May I ask for the key . The nurse can stand behind the screen . Now look there ! Look at the picture ! Sorry , unfortunately . You are probably not completely symptom free yet , Epicycle ... You need a little more treatment . - Nurse , lock the device ! - It 's not possible ... - Unfortunately , it 's necessary ! I don 't want to go to the institution . That was uncontrollable ! - Right . - I don 't want to go back again ! No more ! I don 't want to ! Look , what big cherries ! What giants ! Wait , Fredrik ! Eva wants to tell you something ... – I 'm the driver . - It wasn 't you who drove this morning ... – No , he 's got indigestion . – Yes , but ... - Do you know where you 're going ? - I know where I 'm going ! - I didn 't know you were the driver . - Nor me either until a voice whispered that you were on the visit to the doctor today . - Where shall we go ? - Not to the institution in any case . - But it 's illegal ... - Do you want to go back ? No . Where shall we go ? I came away with six months conditionally and now there are a few of us that have gone underground . - Underground ? What do you mean ? - Literally . We are located in the sewers . The reason police never go there . - I would ike to ... ah ! - Well , tell me ! Can 't we go down to Gyllenblå Lake ? Just a little walk ... - What is this supposed to be for ? - A surprise ! Right . - Kiss him now , then ! - No never ! - Do you remember when we were here ? - Yes . That was before Ratio Rasch , in the bad old times . This is the first time in a year that I 've seen space . ( Buzzing ) - Maybe they 're down at the lake . - Possibly . – Before we went here with sweethearts . - In the old irrational time . - When you fell in love . - And stood here and kissed ! That was close ... You know what I want to do now ? Don 't sneak peek , Fredrik ! Fredrik ! Fredrik ! Fredrik ! That 's it ! Where did he go ? He was number one , the laugh-seeker ! - It was him who stole Fredrik ! - What did I tell you ? - We can 't just leave Frederick ! - But the old man is dangerous ! Come on ! - But where are you going ? Come on ! - Come back , Cecilie ! Cecilie , come on . We stick together ! - Don 't go there , Cecilie ! - The old man may be dangerous ! Fredrik ! - Yes ? - I want to know where Frederick is . Do you ... ? - What 's your name , then ? - It does not concern you . Where 's Frederick ? - Come back , Cecilie ! - Cecilie ! - Come on , let 's go ! - Cecilie ! Help ! Let us out ! - It 's your fault ! - No , you tricked me here . Hey , let us out ! Can you just leave it like that ? But what about the reason police ? They never go where we 're going now . - What 's that sound ? - It 's all the pipes . You get used to it . Come on ! Here ! - I think they 've hidden themselves . - To kiss on the sly ... - Oh , ridiculous ! - The old man has taken them . Now , now , now ! I see ! Yes , Andersson , I believe that it 's advisable to collect Rasch . So , Rasch ! Let 's see ... The course will be 361 degrees . Is it possible ? No , it 's not possible . So , it 's true . Well ? Right , then we 'll use force ! Hello ! Is anyone here ? - Answer ! - One moment ! Sesame , Sesame , ratio legis ! - Be sensible now ! - I 'm coming ! One , two ... - Oh Lord my God ! - Rasch ? Rasch ! My Dog ... Get out , kids ! This is not for you . This , kids ... is dangerous stuff . - No , you can 't be here . - But there 's no danger ... - We don 't tell this to anyone . - No , they 'd think us crazy ! – Do you know where we 'd end up , then ? – Yes . But how do we explain the dog ? Hello . Look what I 've found . Do you know where ? In the president 's garden ! - Do you have children with the Resistance ? - No , just that one . - He 's called Hevelius . - My name is Epicycle . – He 's the last person who could laugh . – He escaped from the institution like you . - Do you think he can laugh again ? – He has spasms in the corners of his mouth sometimes .

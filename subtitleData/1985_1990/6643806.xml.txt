 ( Computer beeps ) ( Beeping continues ) ( Loud thud ) ( Intense buzzing ) ( Buzzing continues ) ( Heavy , sliding thud ) ( Ominous humming ) ( Humming pulses ) ( Pulse ) ( Humming stops ) ( Respirated breathing ) Bio-readouts are all in the green . Looks like she 's alive . Well , there goes our salvage , guys . - How are we today ? - ( Groans ) Terrible . Well , better than yesterday , at least . Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station , been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're OK . Looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy . Come here . Hey , come here . How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ? Where have you been ? Guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Burke . Carter Burke . I work for the company . But don 't let that fool you , I 'm really an OK guy . I 'm glad to see you 're feeling a little better . They , uh , they tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon . It 's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hyper sleep . Or something like that . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? Has no one discussed this with you yet ? No , but , I mean , I don 't ... recognize this place . No , I know . Uh ... OK . It 's just that , uh , this might be a shock to you . It 's longer ... How long ? Please . 57 years . What ? That 's the thing , you were out there for 57 years . What happened was , you had drifted right through the core systems , and it 's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did . It 's one in a thousand , really . I think you 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . ( Rapid heartbeat ) - Are you OK ? ( Hissing ) ( Groans ) ( Heartbeat grows louder ) ( Hissing ) Oh ! ( Burke ) You OK ? ( Ripley grunts ) ( Heartbeat intensifies ) ( Hissing ) Oh ! God ! Nurse , please ! Someone get in here now ! Now ! - Hold ! - Please ... Hold her ! Kill me ! NO ! No ! ( Groans ) Bad dreams again ? You want something to help you sleep ? No . ( Sighs ) I 've slept enough . ( Whispering ) Jonesy ... Come here . ( Jonesy meows softly ) - Shh ... It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's over . ( Jonesy purring ) ( Birds singing ) Hi , sorry I 'm late . I 've been running behind all morning . Is there any word about my daughter ? Uh , I really think we should worry about the hearing now , ' cause we don 't have a lot of time , OK ? I read your deposition , and it 's great . If you just stick to that , I think we 'll be fine . The thing to remember is that there are gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there - you got feds , Interstellar Commerce Commission , Colonial Administration , insurance company guys ... Do you have any news about my daughter ? Well , we did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest ... Amanda Ripley-McClaren - married name , I guess - aged 66 . And that was at the time of her death . Which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy ... She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository , Little Chute , Wisconsin . No children . I checked . I promised her that I 'd be home for her birthday . Her 11th birthday . ( Shuddering gasp ) Oh ! ( Man ) I 'd just like to go , uh , back to this point about the override destruct I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . Now how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please . Now you freely admit to detonating the engines of and thereby destroying an M-Class star-freighter , a rather expensive piece of hardware . 42 million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account , in that , for reasons unknown , the Nostromo set down on LV-426 , an unsurveyed planet at that time . That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct , by you , - for reasons unknown . - Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down there on company orders to get this thing , which destroyed my crew . And your expensive ship . The analysis team , which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter , found no physical evidence of the creature you described . Good . That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn airlock . Like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said that it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft , it was an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds . " A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " - Yes . These are your words . - " And has concentrated acid for blood . " - That 's right . Look , I can see where this is going . But I 'm telling you that those things exist . - Thank you , Officer Ripley , that will be all . - Please , you 're not listening to me . Kane , the crew member ... Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs there . Thousands . - Thank you , that will be all . - Goddammit , that 's not all ! Because if one of those things gets down here , then will be all , then all this , this bullshit that you think is so important , you can just kiss all that goodbye ! It is the finding of this court of inquiry that Warrant Officer E Ripley , NOC 14472 , has acted with questionable judgment , and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . Now no criminal charges will be filed against you at this time , and you are released on your own recognizance for a six-month period of psychometric probation , to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . That could have been better . Look , I think the im ... Ripley ? Van Leuwen ? Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . There have been people there over 20 years , and they never complained about any hostile organism . What do you mean , what people ? Terraformers . Planet engineers . They go in and set up these big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a " shake 'n'bake " colony . How many are there ? How many colonists ? I don 't know , 60 , maybe 70 families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . ( Intense wind howling ) ( Vehicle horn honks ) - I 'll be down in Maintenance , OK ? - Al ? - What ? - Hey , Al ... - What ? Remember you sent some wildcatters out into the middle of nowhere last week ? - Uh , out past the Ilium range ? - Yeah , what ? Well , one of them 's on the horn , a mom pop survey team , Says he 's onto something , wants to know if his claim will be honored . Why wouldn 't his claim be honored ? Well , because you sent them out to that particular middle of nowhere on company orders maybe ? I dunno . Christ ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference . We look . They don 't say why , and I don 't ask , I don 't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here , - and the answer is always - ( Both ) " Don 't ask . " So what do I tell this guy ? Tell him as far as I 'm concerned , if he finds something , it is his . - Lydecker ? - What ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be on this level . Go on , get outta here . ( Kids giggling ) ( Instense wind howling ) - You too , you go in places we can 't fit . - So ? That 's why I 'm the best ! Knock it off . I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again , I 'll tan your hides . - Mom , all the kids play ... - I don 't care . Wait a minute . Annie , c 'mon have a look at this , will ya ? Folks , we have scored big this time . What is it , Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's see if we can 't get a closer look at this thing maybe through that crack down the side . - Shouldn 't we call in ? - Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . That 's about as close as we can get . Shall we take a look inside ? You kids stay inside . I mean it . We 'll be right back . - OK . - Bye . - Bye ( Thunder ) ( Electrical arcing ) ( Electrical arcing ) ( Wind howling ) Timmy , they 've been gone a long time . It 'll be OK , Newt . Dad knows what he 's doing . ( Door screeches open ) Mayday , mayday ! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control ! - Alpha Two Four Niner ... ( Newt screams ) ( Wind drowns out screams ) ( Jonesy meows ) ( Door chime ) Hiya , Ripley . This is Lt. Gorman of the Colonial Marine Co ... Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me at the wolves , and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . - Can I finish ? - No . There 's no way . Ripley , you wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . Lieutenant , am I right ? That 's true . We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . ( Scoffs ) Then you don 't need me , I 'm not a soldier . ( Burke ) Yeah , but we don 't know exactly what 's going on out there . It may just be a downed transmitter , okay ? But if it 's not , I would like you there as an adviser , and that 's all . What 's your interest in all this ? Why are you going ? The corporation co-financed that colony along with Colonial Administration . We 're getting into a lot of terraforming now , building better worlds ... Yeah , yeah I saw the commercial . Look , I don 't have time for this . I 've gotta get to work . Oh , right . I heard you 're working in the cargo docks . That 's right . Running loaders and forklifts , that sort of thing ? - Yeah ? So ? - Nothing . I think It 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I - I know it 's the only thing that you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . Yeah , if you go . Come on . That 's a second chance , kiddo . I think personally for you it would be the best thing in the world to get out there and face this thing . Get back on the horse ... Spare me , Burke . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . Yeah , I know . I 've read it . You wake up every night , your sheets are soaking with sweat ... I said no ... and I mean it ! Now please leave . I am not going back , and I am ... I would not be any good to you if I did . OK . Shh ... ( Whispering ) Would you do me a favor ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . ( Jonesy meows ) ( Gasping ) Ah ! Ah ! Oh ! ( Shuddering gasp ) ( Repeating tone ) Hello ? Ripley . - You OK ? - Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study , not to bring back , but to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right , I 'm in . I think that ... And you , you little shithead , you 're staying here . ( Door hinges squeaking ) ( Chains clinking ) ( Computer clicking ) ( Motors whirring ) ( Clunk ) ( Marine coughing ) They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? Is that a joke ? Oh , I wish it were . Hey , Hicks . Man , you look just like I feel . ( Coughing ) Alright , sweethearts , what are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the Corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm . Every meal 's a banquet ! Every paycheck a fortune . Every formation a parade . I love the Corps ! - Oh God , Sarge , please ! - Man , this floor is freezing ! What do you want me to do , fetch your slippers for ya ? Gee , would you , sir ? I 'd like that . Look into my eye . Fall in , people . Come on . Let 's go . - I hate this job . - Crowe , Wierzbowski , on your feet . You just had three weeks on your back , Frost . Come on . ( Frost ) I 'm talkin ' about breathing , not this frozen shit . Yeah , Top , how about it ? Alright , first assembly 's in 15 , people . Shag it . Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . Apparently she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fuckin ' - do . ( Ferro chuckles ) - ( Hudson ) Hey , I 'm impressed . - Que bonita , ah ? Hey Vasquez , have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? ( Drake laughs ) Oh , Vasquez . You 're just too bad . Uhn ! - Hey Top , what 's the op ? - It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity . ( Laughing ) Favorite duty . - Dumb-ass colonists . - Hicks . - What 's this crap supposed to be ? - Corn bread , I think . It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . Hey ... I sure wouldn 't mind gettin ' some more of that Arcturian poontang . Remember that time ? - Haha , you know it ! - Yeah , Frost , but the one that you had was male . - ( Marines laughing ) - Don 't matter when it 's Arcturian , baby . - Hey Bishop , do the thing with the knife . - Oh , please . Come on . - All right ! - I don 't wanna see that , man ! ( Hudson ) Come on , man . Alright . Hey. what are you doin ' , man ? Hey , what are you doin ' ? - C 'mon , quit messin ' around , Drake . - Don 't move . Ah , just shut up . Bishop ! Hey , man . - Do it , Bishop . - Hey , not me , man ! - Yeah , you . Don 't move . - Hey , c 'mon , quit messin ' around . C 'mon ! Trust me . ( Screaming ) - ( Sarge ) All right , knock it off , knock it off . - Thank you . ( Marines laughing ) ( Sarge ) Your nerves feel like shit ? ( Drake ) Enjoy your meal . That wasn 't funny , man . - Lieutenant Gorman ? - No . - Mr. Burke ? - Yeah . Thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . Boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . ( Burke ) Thought you never missed , Bishop . You never said anything about an android being on board . Why not ? It never ... never occurred to me . It 's just common practice , we always have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term " artificial person " myself . Right . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't even ... Ripley 's last trip out , the syn ... the artificial person malfunctioned . ( Scoffs ) Malfunctioned ? There were problems , and a ... a few deaths were involved . - I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? - Yeah , the Hyperdyne Systems 120-A / 2 . Well , that explains it . I mean , the A / 2s always were a bit twitchy . That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm , or by omission of action allow to be harmed a human being . Sure you don 't want some ? ( Tray clatters across floor ) You just stay away from me , Bishop , you got that straight ? Guess she don 't like the corn bread either . ( Sarge ) Squad , ten-hut ! Officer on deck . ( Gorman ) As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right , listen up . Morning , Marines . I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you people before we left Gateway , but ... - Sir ? - What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . - What 's the question ? - Is this gonna be a stand-up fight , sir , or another bug hunt ? All we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony , and that a xenomorph may be involved . - Excuse me , sir , a ... a what ? - A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . What exactly are we dealing with here ? Ripley ? I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . One of our crew members was brought back on board with something attached to his face , some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off , it wouldn 't come off . Later it seemed to come off by itself and die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner and , um ... It must have laid something inside his throat , some sort of embryo . He started ... - um ... he ... - ( Vasquez ) Look , man ... I only need to know one thing : where they are . - Yo , Vasquez . Kick ass , babe . - Anytime , anywhere , man . Right , right . Somebody said " alien " , she thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up . - Fuck you , man . - Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . ( Gorman ) Yeah , ok right . Thank you , Ripley . We also have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . And if the colonists have found that ship , then there 's no telling how many of them have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so you better look at it . Any questions ? - What is it , Private ? - How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth , and by the numbers . I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . Ordnance loading , weapons strip and dropship prep details will have seven hours . ( Ferro ) Oh , come on . Now move it , people ! Alright sweethearts , you heard the man and you know the drill ! Assholes and elbows ! Hudson , come here . Come here . I don 't care if you are short , Hudson , get it done . - Hey Sarge , you 'll get lip cancer smokin ' those . - Corporal , I want this loading lock sealed . Now ! - How many more you got , Spunkmeyer ? - Last one . Good . Take it away . Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Just come out ? Let me see it . Hi . I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here , is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class 2 rating . ( Chomping cigar ) Be my guest . ( Click , thunk ) ( Click , thunk ) ( Thunk ) ( Motors spool up ) Where you want it ? ( Laughs heartily ) Bay 12 , please . ( Drake grunts ) ( Turbines spooling up ) ( Sarge ) Alright , sweethearts , we 're a team , and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we gonna conquer , and we gonna kick some . Is that understood ? - Yessir . - Yeah . That 's what we gonna do , sweethearts . We are going to go and get some . ( Sarge ) All right , people , on the ready line . ( Drake ) You 're ok , baby . - Are you lean ? - ( All ) Yeah ! Are you mean ? - ( All ) Yeah ! - What are you ? What are you ? - Lean , mean marines ! Hudson ! Get on the ready line , Marines ! Get some today ! Get on the ready line ! Move it out ! Move it out , goddammit ! Get hot ! 1 , 2 , 3 , c 'mon ! Get out , get out , get out ! Move it out , move it out , move it out ! Move it out , move it out , move it out ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 , 2 , 3 ! ( Growls ) Absolutely badasses ! Let 's pack ' em in . Get in there ! Move it . One , two , three , four , five , six ! All right , I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed . Let 's go . Come on , settle down , people . - Lock ' em in , Hudson . - Ready to get it on ? You know it . OK , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on . Yo ! ( Ferro ) Stand by , cross-locking now . Pre-launch auto cycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . ( Hudson ) Shit , man . ( Ferro ) Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . ( Gorman ) Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by , 10 seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer . On my mark . Five ... We 're on an express elevator to hell . Going down . .. two , one , mark . Whoooo ... .. ... hoooooo ! Switch to DCS ranging . - ( Spunkmeyer ) 2-4-0 . Nominal to profile . - ( Ferro ) We 're in the pipe . Five by five . ( Spunkmeyer ) We 're picking up some hull ionization . Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? 38 . Simulated . How many combat drops ? Uh , two . Including this one . - Shit . - Oh , man . Range 0-1-4 . Turning on final . ( Frost ) Man , I 'm tellin ' ya , I got a bad feeling about this drop . ( Wierzbowski ) You always say that , Frost , you always say " I got a bad feeling about this drop . " ( Frost ) Ok , ok . When we get back without ya , I 'll call your folks . ( Heart monitor beeping ) All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody online . Lookin ' good . Drake , check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . I 'm ready , man . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . State-of-the-badass-art . You do not wanna fuck with me . Check it out . Hey Ripley , don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . ( Laughs ) Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam Phalanx . Whap ! Fry half a city with this puppy . We got tactical smart missiles , phased-plasma pulse rifles , RPGs , - we got sonic electronic ball breakers ! - ( Marine ) Whoo ! We got nukes , we got knives , sharp sticks ... ( Sarge ) Knock it off , Hudson . All right , gear up . Two minutes , people . Get hot ! Somebody wake up Hicks . - Coming around for a 7-0-9er . - Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . - That 's the atmosphere processor ? - Yep , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . You know , we manufacture those , by the way . ( Gorman ) Ok , Ferro , take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . Alright . Hold at 40 . ( Ferro ) Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . - They still have power . - Ok , Ferro , Set down on the landing grid . Immediate dust-off on my clear , then stay on station . ( Ferro ) Down and clear . Ten seconds , people . Look sharp . Alright , I want a nice clean dispersal this time . ( Sarge ) Let 's go . Move it out ! Head ' em up ! First squad up online . Hicks , get yours in a cordon . Watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move ! Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . ( Sarge ) Second squad online . ( Door latch releases ) ( Whispering ) Are you set ? Go on . Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . ( Sarge ) Sir , are you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . Uhh , we got some explosives damage . It 's probably seismic survey charges . Are you readin ' this ? Keep it tight , people . ( Gorman ) Alright , Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . ( Trackers pulsing ) Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . ( Sarge snaps fingers ) ( Hicks ) Ok , Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . ( Tracker pulsing over comms ) ( Tracker begins beeping ) ( Beeping intensifies ) ( Whispering ) It 's right in there . - Now . - Now ! ( Hudson grunts ) - Good one , Hudson . - Uh , sir uh , we have a negative situation here . Uh , moving on , sir . Wait . Wait . Tell him to ... Hicks , back up . Pan right . There . You seeing ' this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you like that , you 're gonna love this . - Quit screwin ' around . - Second squad , what 's your status ? ( Hicks ) Uh , we just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , uh , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , I think we missed it . ( Sighs ) Alright , the area 's secured . Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us . - Wait a minute , it 's not secured , are you nuts ? - The area is secured , Ripley . First team , head for Operations . Hudson , see if you can get their CPU online . Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . - Roger . - He 's comin ' in . I feel safer already . - Pendejo jerk-off . ( Hudson ) Sir , we got the CPU online . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . OK , let 's go . Are you all right ? Yes . ( Drake ) Sir , they sealed off this wing at both ends . Welded the doors , and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . ( Gorman ) Uh huh . But it looks like , uh , the barricade didn 't hold . - Any bodies ? - No , sir . - Last stand . - Must have been a hell of a fight . Yeah . Looks that way . ( Gorman ) Alright , Drake , this way . We should be able to cut through the medlab to Operations . Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones ? Careful , Burke . ( Gasps ) Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . ( Chuckles ) Two are alive , the rest are dead . Surgically removed before embryo implantation . Subject : Marachek , John J. Died during the procedure . They killed him taking it off . ( Tracker pulsing , begins beeping ) Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . - Behind us . - One of us ? ( Gorman ) Apone , where are your people ? Anybody in D-Block ? Uh , that 's a negative . We 're all in Operations . Talk to me , Frosty . Just keep movin ' , baby . ( Canister clatters ) ( Gasps ) - It 's moving . - Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . ( Tracker tone escalates ) - Fuck . - Hold up . Ripley . ( Whispering ) Hey ... Sh ... It 's alright . It 's alright , come on . - Just grab her , Corporal . - Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . Sh ... It 's all right . It 's ok . Come on out . Come on . Easy ... Easy ... I got her . Ow ! Damn ! - Watch her ! - Don 't let her go ! - She 's under the grille ! - Frost , get your light up here . - Where 'd she go ? ( Marine ) She on the other side of us ! - Shine the light . - Down here , here ! - Here , here ! - There she is . ( Ripley ) Keep back , keep back . Don 't scare her . - Grab her , man . We 're gonna lose her . - ( Ripley ) Damn it . ( Ripley ) No ! Wait ! ( Newt breathing heavily ) It 's OK . It 's all right . ( Newt gasps ) Don 't be afraid . See ? - Wait . No , you don 't . - ( Newt grunting ) - It 's OK . You 're gonna be all right now . - ( Newt continues grunting ) ( Ripley ) Shhh ... Easy , easy . It 's gonna be OK . It 's alright , you 're gonna be OK . - Shh .. sh sh sh sh ... - ( Newt calms down ) Easy , easy . - What 's her name again ? - Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? - Now look , Rebecca , you have to try and help ... - Gorman ... give it a rest , why don 't you ? - Total brain lock . - Physically she 's OK . Borderline malnutrition , but I don 't think there 's any permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . Oop ! That good , huh ? Uh oh ... I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one , too . You don 't talk much , do you ? - Smoking or non-smoking ? - Just tell me what you 're scanning for , Private . - PDTs . - Huh ? Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within 20 klicks we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . You know , I don 't know how you managed to stay alive , But you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . ( Whispering ) N-Newt . - What 'd you say ? - Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt ? I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this ? Hm ? - Casey . - Hello , Casey . What about your brother ? What 's his name ? Timmy . Is Timmy around here too , maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and dad ? Newt ... Look at me . Where are they ? They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . ( Door whirs open ) Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . - That 's a nice pet you got there , Bishop . - Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo ! Stop your grinnin ' and drop your linen . Found ' em . - They alive ? - Unknown . But it looks like all of ' em . Over at the processing station . Sub-level 3 , under the main cooling towers . - Looks like a goddamn town meeting . - Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . Alright . Let 's go , people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Let 's go , head ' em out . Ok , Frost , you 're drivin ' . ( Whispering ) It 's ok . Don 't worry . It 'll be ok . ( Gorman ) I want a straight V deployment . Second team on left flank . Advance on axial 6-6-4 . Tracker online . Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient . ( Apone ) Hudson , tracker online . Left and right , little buddy . ( Gorman ) 40 meters in bearing 221 , there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . ( Gorman ) You want sub-level 3 . Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . ( Sarge ) Check those corners ! Watch your spacing . Alright , you heard the man , don 't bunch up . Stay loose . ( Gorman ) Uh , your transmission 's showing a lot of break-up . ( Hudson ) Probably getting some interference from the structure . ( Sarge ) Use those lights ! Next one down . Then proceed on a 2-1-6 . ( Apone ) Uh , roger . That 's a 2-1-6 . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me , man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . ( Apone ) Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies in here . Easy . ( Hicks ) Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . ( Apone ) Nice and easy . - Looks like some sort of secreted resin . - Yeah ... but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothin ' . Busy little creatures , huh ? - Hot as hell in here . - Yeah , man , but it 's a dry heat . ( Apone ) Knock it off , Hudson . ( Hudson 's tracker pulsing ) Lt. , what do those pulse rifles fire ? 10-mm explosive-tip caseless . Standard light-armor - piercing round . Why ? Well , look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So , if they fire their weapons in there , won 't they rupture the cooling system ? ( Burke ) Whoa , ho ho ... Yeah , she 's absolutely right . So ? So what ? Look , this whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So you 're talking about a thermonuclear explosion and " Adiós , muchachos . " Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit . Look ... Uh ... Apone ? ( Snaps fingers ) Look . We can 't have any firing in there . I , uh , I want you to collect magazines from everybody . Is he fuckin ' crazy ? What the hell are we supposed to use , man , harsh language ? Flame units only . I want rifles slung . - Sir , I ... - Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . ( Tracker pulsing ) All right , sweethearts , you heard the man , pull ' em out . Come on , let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn . You too . Give it up , Ski . Come on , let 's go . Crowe , I want it now . Give it up . ( Drake ) Right on , Vas . Let 's go , Marine , give it up . Frost , you got the duty . Open that bag . - Thanks a lot , sarge . - Hicks , cover our ass . Head ' em out , people . I like to keep this handy ... for close encounters . I heard that . ( Tracker pulsing ) - ( Gorman ) Any movement ? - ( Hudson ) Nothing . Zip . Holy shit . ( Ripley ) Newt , go sit up front . Go on . Now ! ( Tracker pulsing ) ( Apone ) Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it movin ' . Easy . - Top ! - What ? ( Dietrich ) Top , get over here , we got a live one ! You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . ( Shuddering whisper ) Please ... K-kill me . Just stay calm . We 're gonna get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . Give me a hand . - Oh , man . - We gotta get her outta here ( Sarge ) What is it , Dietrich ? What 's goin ' on ? Convulsion ! ( Victim screams ) - Dietrich , get back ! Get back ! - ( Dietrich ) Dammit ! ( Victim screams ) ( Bones breaking ) ( Alien screeching ) No ! - ( Sarge ) Frost ! Flame-thrower ! - ( Hudson ) Kill it , man ! Kill it ! Get back . Flame-thrower . Move ! ( Alien screeching ) ( Grunts ) ( Screeching dies away ) ( Ominous hissing sound ) ( Tracker begins beeping ) - Movement ! What 's the position ? - Uh , can 't lock in ! - Talk to me , Hudson ! Uh ... Multiple signals ! They 're closing ! Go to infrared , people . Look sharp ! What 's happening , Apone ? We can 't see anything in here ! Pull your team out , Gorman . ( Tracker beeping escalates ) I got signals , I got readings in front and behind ! - Where , man ? I don 't see shit . - He 's right . There 's nothing back here . Look , I 'm tellin ' ya , there 's somethin ' moving , and it ain 't us ! ( Whispering ) Oh , shit ! ( Hudson ) Tracker 's off-scale , man . They 're all around us , man . Jesus . Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . ( Dietrich screaming ) ( Frost screams ) ( Hicks ) Frost ! ( Dietrich continues screaming ) Come on ! Oohh ! Oof ! ( Flat-line alarm ) Jesus Christ , Apone , what is going on ? ( Hicks ) Wierzbowski and Crowe are down ! - Dietrich , Crowe ! Sound off ! - ( Hicks ) Dietrich , Frost , off the board ! Frost ! ( Flat-line alarm continues ) ( Apone ) Frost ! ( Wierbowski begins screaming ) Wierzbowski ! Wierzbowski ! ( Screaming over comms ) ( Vasquez grunts ) Let 's rock ! ( Machine gun fire , Marine screams ) Who 's firing ? Goddammit ! Yeah ! I ordered a hold fire . ( Hudson ) They 're coming out of the walls ! They 're coming out of the goddamn walls ! Let 's book ! ( Vasquez ) On your right , man ! Uh , Apone , I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with ... Vasquez , Drake , hold your fire , goddammit ! ( Gorman ) Apone , are you copying me ? I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads ... - ... to the APC . Say again ? All after " incinerators " . I said I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the i-incinerators and fall back ... by squads to the APC . Uhn ! ( Apone groans ) - ( Vasquez ) TOP ! - ( Hudson ) Sarge ! Sarge ! - ( Hicks ) Sarge ! - Talk to me . Apone ? ( Hicks ) - Top , you copy ? ! - Talk to me , Apone ! - He 's gone ! - Get them out of there ! - Shut up . - Do it now ! - Shut up ! - Hicks , whoever 's left , get the hell out ... Goddammit ! - Just shut up ! Where 's Apone ? The sarge is gone . Let 's get the fuck outta here ! Let 's go , Marines ! Hudson ? Vasquez ? - Hudson , look out ! - Get it ! ( Alien screeches ) ( Hicks ) Hudson ! Hicks , Hicks ! ( Marines yelling ) - I told them to fall back . - ( Hicks ) Fall back , goddammit , now ! I told them to fall back ! - They 're cut off ! - ( Hicks ) Hudson , move your ass ! - Do something ! Fuck ! - ( Hicks ) Let 's go , Marines ! - Come on , keep moving , baby ! - Hold on , Newt . ( Engine spooling up ) Ripley , what the hell are you doing ? ( Tires screeching ) ( Gorman ) Turn around ! That 's an order ! - ( Gorman ) Turn this thing around ! - ( Ripley ) Get off me , damn it ! ( Gorman ) Goddammit , that 's an order ! ( Burke ) You had your chance , Gorman . - Come on . - Come on , Vas . ( Hicks ) C 'mon , let 's move it ! ( Alien screaming ) ( Vasquez ) Come on , let 's go , let 's go ! ( Hudson ) It 's blocked , man , we 've gotta go around . Open the door ! Hicks ! Drake , we are leaving ! ( Drake ) Get them , Vas ! Run for it ! Shit ! ( Grunting ) - ( Hudson ) Go ! Go ! - ( Vasquez ) Drake , come on , man ! Drake , come on ! ( Alien screeches ) ( Drake grunts in pain ) - ( Drake screaming ) - Nooo ! - ( Hudson ) Fire in the hold ! - ( Hicks ) He 's gone ! - No ! Drake 's out there ! - Put it out , put it out , go ! Go ! - Drake 's coming . - He 's gone . No he 's ... not ! Forget him , he 's gone ! Get on the goddamn door ! Eat this ! ( Hudson screams ) Ripley ! Go , go , go ! ( Tires screeching ) ( Hicks grunting ) ( Screeching ) ( Screeching ) ( Alien screeches ) ( Sickening crunch ) ( Bang and grinding ) It 's all right , we 're clear ! Ripley ! You 've blown the transaxle . You 're just grinding metal . Come on , ease down . Ease down . Ease down . ( Quietly ) Ease down . ( Newt coughs ) - ( Coughing ) - You OK ? ( Hudson ) I 'm alright . ( Burke ) Shouldn 't we ... - Get away from me , man ! - Lieutenant . - What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know . Maybe a concussion . - But he 's alive . - No , he 's dead ! - Wake up , Pendejo ! Then I 'm gonna kill you ! - Back off . Right now . ( Thud ) Somebody get me a first-aid kit . Hey . Hey look . The sarge and Dietrich aren 't dead , man . Their signs are real low , but they ain 't dead . - Then we go back in there and get them . - Fuck that . - We don 't leave our people behind ! - I ain 't going back in there and - you can 't make me ! - You can 't help them ! You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . Oh Dear Lord Jesus , this ain 't happening ' , man . This can 't be happenin ' , man , this isn 't happening ' ! All right . We 've got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we roll them in there and nerve-gas the whole fuckin ' nest . It 's worth a try , but we don 't even know if it 's gonna affect ' em . Look , let 's just bug out and call it even , ok ? What are we talking about this for ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . - Fuckin ' A. - ( Burke ) Ho - ho - hold on , hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it . ( Scoffs ) They can bill me . Ok. look . This is an emotional moment for all of us , ok ? I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments , please . This is clearly ... clearly an important species we 're dealing with and I don 't think that you or I or anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them . - Wrong . - Yeah . Watch us . Hey , maybe you haven 't been keeping up on current events , but we just got our asses kicked , pal ! Look . I 'm not blind to what 's going on , but I cannot authorize that kind of action . I 'm sorry . Well , I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here . Corporal Hicks is ... ? This operation is under military jurisdiction , and Hicks is next in chain of command , am I right , Corporal ? Yeah ... Yeah . That 's right . Yeah . Look , Ripley , this is a multi-million-dollar installation , ok ? He can 't make that kind of decision . He 's just a grunt . - No offense . - None taken . - Ferro , do you copy ? - Standing by . Prep for dustoff . We 're gonna need immediate evac . Roger . On our way . I say we take off , nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . ( Hicks ) Let 's go , pick it up , Hudson ! Pick it up , baby ! All right , we 'll set him down here . Move it , Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . - Hold on a second , there 's something ... - Just get up here ! I 'm in . Ramp closing . Spunkmeyer ... Goddammit . Well , where the fu ... ? ( Hissing fiercely ) Run ! ( Explosion ) ( Second explosion ) ( Metal bar clanks along ground ) Well , that 's great ! That 's just fuckin ' great , man ! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now , man ! Are you finished ? Are you all right ? I guess we 're not gonna be leaving now , right ? I 'm sorry , Newt . You don 't have to be sorry . It wasn 't your fault . That 's it , man . Game over , man ! Game over ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? What are we gonna do ? Maybe we could build a fire , sing a couple of songs , huh ? Why don 't we try that ? We 'd better get back , 'cause it 'll be dark soon , and they mostly come at night . Mostly . - That 's everything , right ? - Yeah All right , this is absolutely everything that we could salvage out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got , uh , 15 of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . - Is that the only flame-thrower ? - Yeah . It 's only half-full but it 's functional . Got another one that 's damaged . I don 't know about that one . But the good news ... We got four of these robot sentries , with display and scanners intact . They really kick ass . I think they 'll come in handy . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 17 days . 17 days ? Hey man , I don 't wanna rain on your parade , but we 're not gonna last 17 hours . Those things are gonna come in here just like they did before , and they 're gonna - come in here and - Hudson ! - and they 're gonna get us ! - Hudson ! This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . Right ? - Why don 't you put her in charge ? - You 'd better just start dealing with it , Hudson . Listen to me . Hudson , just deal with it because we need you and I 'm sick of your bullshit . Now I want you to get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor-plan file . Do you understand ? Construction blueprints , I don 't care . Anything that shows the layout of this place . Are you listening ? Yeah . I need to see air ducts , I need to see electrical access tunnels , sub-basements , every possible way into this complex . - We don 't have much time . - OK . - OK . I 'm on it . - Hudson ... Just relax . ( Exhales sharply ) I 'll be in medlab . Check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . ( Ripley ) So this service tunnel must be how they 're moving back and forth . ( Hudson ) That 's right . It leads from the processing station right into the sub-level here . Come down on that . OK , come over . Go back ... OK , punch that in right there . - No . It 's back . - OK . Well , there 's a pressure door at this end . Couldn 't we put one of the remote sentry units in the tunnel and then seal that door ? Yeah , that 'll work , but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . - That 's right . So we repair the barricades at these two intersections , - Right . and weld plate steel over these ducts here , and here , and here . That way they can only come at us from these two quarters . Right . Then we put the other sentry units here and here . Right ? - Right . - Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . All right , people , let 's move like we got a purpose . - ( Hudson ) Affirmative - A-ffirmative . ( Hudson ) Do your thing , baby . C 'mon , c 'mon , Vasquez , let 's get the hell outta here . Hudson here . A and B sentries are in place and keyed . ( Hicks ) Roger . Stand by , arming now . Test it , Hudson . - Do it ! - Fire in the hole ! OK , great , now let 's get the hell outta here . We 're sealing the tunnel . Come on , baby . ( Welding sounds ) For what it 's worth . Here , I ... I kinda want you to put this on . - What 's it for ? - It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . It 's just a precaution . Thanks . It doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . All right , what 's next ? ( Sentry units beeping ) Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now , you lie here and have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to sleep . I have scary dreams . Well , I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nope . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her , hm ? Ripley , she doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . ( Laughs ) I 'm sorry , Newt . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters , no real ones . But there are . Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Did one of those things grow inside her ? I don 't know , Newt . That 's the truth . Isn 't that how babies come ? I mean , people babies ? - They grow inside you . - No . That 's very different . - Did you ever have a baby ? - Yes , I did . I had a little girl . Where is she ? She 's gone . You mean dead . Here . Take this . For luck . How 's that ? Don 't go . Please . Newt , I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera right up there ? I can see you right through that camera all the time to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you , Newt . I mean that . That 's a promise . You promise ? I cross my heart . And hope to die ? And hope to die . Now go to sleep . And don 't dream . ( Laughs ) Sneak . ( Bishop ) The molecular acid oxidizes after the creature 's death , completely neutralizing it . Bishop , you know that 's very interesting , but it doesn 't really get us anywhere , does it ? I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with here . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists , they move them over there and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these . Which would mean there would have to be a lot of these parasites , right ? - One for each colonist . Over 100 at least . - Yes , that follows . But each of these things comes from an egg , right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . - Maybe it 's like an ant hive . - Bees , man . Bees have hives . You know what I mean . There ' like ... one female that runs the whole show . - Yes . The queen . - Yeah , the mama . - She 's badass , man . I mean big . - These things ain 't ants , stupido . I know that . Bishop , I want these specimens destroyed as soon as you 're finished with them , is that clear ? Mr. Burke gave instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs . He was very specific about it . Look , those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division , right ? Now , if you 're smart , we can both come out of this heroes , and we will be set up for life . You 're crazy , Burke , do you know that ? You really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past ICC quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it , Burke . From me . Just like they 'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists . - Wait a second ... - You sent them to that ship . - You 're wrong ! - I just checked the colony log , Directive dated 6 / 12 / 79 , signed Burke , Carter J. You sent them out there and didn 't even warn them . - Why didn 't you warn them , Burke ? - Ok , look . What if that ship didn 't even exist ? Do you ever think about that ? I didn 't know . So now if I went and made a major security situation out of it , everybody steps in , administration steps in and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . Nobody wins . So I made a decision , and it was wrong . It was a bad call , Ripley . It was a bad call . Bad call ? These people are dead , Burke ! Don 't you have any idea what you 've done here ? Well , I 'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall for this . You 're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . Ripley ... I ... You know , I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . ( Alarm begins blaring ) - ( Hudson ) What is it ? What 's goin ' on ? - ( Hicks ) They 're coming . ( Hudson ) Where ? ( Hicks ) In the tunnel . Here we go . A and B gun tracking and firing . Multiple targets . Look at those ammo counters go . B gun 's down 50 % . Man , it 's a shooting gallery down there . 60 rounds left on B. 40 ... 20 ... 10 . B gun 's dry . 20 on A. 10 ... 5 ... - That 's it . - Jesus . They 're wall-to-wall in there . They 're at the pressure door . - Man , listen to that . - Bishop here . - I 'm afraid I have some bad news . - Well , that 's a switch . It 's very pretty , Bishop , but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . ( Hudson ) Oh , that 's beautiful , man . Oh , man , that-that-that just beats it all . - How long till it blows ? - Four hours . With a blast radius of 30 kilometers , equal to about 40 megatons . We got problems . ( Hudson ) I don 't believe this . I don 't fuckin ' believe this ! - Vasquez , close the shutters . - Why can 't we shut it down from here ? I 'm sorry . The crash caused too much damage , an overload is inevitable at this point Oh , man . And I was gettin ' short . Four more weeks and out . Now I 'm gonna buy it on this rock . - It ain 't half-fair , man . - Hudson , give us a break ! Four more weeks . Oh , man . Well , we 've got to get the other dropship from the Sulaco . I mean , there must be some way to bring it down on remote . How ? The transmitter was on the APC , it 's wasted . Well , I don 't care how , but we 'd better think of something . - We better think of a way ! - Think of what ? We 're fucked ! - Shut up ! - We 're doomed ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? The uplink tower down at the other end ? - Why can 't we use ... - No , I checked . The hard wiring between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Well , somebody 's gonna have to go out there . Take a portable terminal , go out there and patch in manually . Oh , yeah , sure ! With those things runnin ' around ? You can count me out . - Yeah , I guess we can count you out of everything , Hudson . - I 'll go . - Hey , why don 't you go , man ? - I 'll go . - What ? - I 'll go . I mean , I 'm the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . Yeah right , man . Bishop should go . Good idea . Believe me , I 'd prefer not to . I may be synthetic , but I 'm not stupid . ( Ripley ) How long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly . 180 meters . - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there , - Right ... an hour to patch in and align the antenna , 30 minutes to prep the ship , and about 50 minutes flight time . ( Ripley ) It 's gonna be close . - Good luck . - See you soon . Watch your fingers . ( Vasquez ) Vaya con Dios , man . ( Hicks ) This is unbelievable . 20 meters and closing . - 15 . - How many ? Can 't tell . Lots . D gun 's down 50 % . C gun 's right behind it . ( Hudson ) It ain 't stopping ' ' em . It just ain 't stopping ' ' em 150 rounds on D. C 'mon ! C 'mon , baby . C 'mon ! ( Hicks ) 100 rounds . ( Hudson ) C 'mon , c 'mon ! D gun 's down to 20 . 10 . Damn it . Wait . They 're retreating . The guns stopped them . You 're right . - Next time they walk right up and knock . - Yeah , but they don 't know that . They 're probably looking for other ways to get in . That 'll take ' em a while . - Maybe we got ' em demoralised . - Shut up . I want you two walking perimeter . Move ! Hey , listen . We 're all in strung-out shape . But stay frosty ... and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . Vámonos ! How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? 24 hours ? Hicks , I 'm not gonna end up like those others . You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? If it comes to that , I 'll do us both . Listen . Let 's just make sure it doesn 't come to that . All right ? All right . Hey , I wanna introduce you to a personal friend of mine . This is an M41-A pulse rifle , 10mm , with an over-and-under 30-mm pump-action grenade launcher . Feel the weight . Ok . What do I do ? - Ok . Pull it in tight here . - Right . - Lean into it . Now , it will kick some . - Mm hmm . Right . When the counter reads zero here , you ... - I press this up ? - That 's right . And get another one in quick . Slap it in hard . - Right . - Now you 're ready to rock 'n'roll . - What 's this ? - Eh , that 's the grenade launcher . - I don 't think you wanna mess with that . - You started this . Show me everything . I can handle myself . Yeah , I noticed . - How do you feel ? - All right , I guess . One hell of a hangover . - Look , Ripley , I just want ... - Forget it . Excuse me . ( Newt whimpers ) Sh , sh , sh , sh ... It 's OK . ( Wind howling intensely ) ( Electrical arcing ) ( Turbines begin spooling up ) ( Inhales sharply ) ( Whispering ) Newt ... - Wake up . - Wha ... ? Be quiet . We 're in trouble . ( Newt screams ) Move , Newt ! ( Ripley and Newt grunting ) Hey ! ( Silent pounding and yelling ) Help ! Help ! - Hicks ! - Somebody ! ( Hicks ) Uh , say again , Bishop . You 've got it into auto refuel mode , and it 's sequencing right ? - That 's right ! - Ok , good . Stay on it . Affirmative ! Get back to me when you 've activated the launch cycle . Roger ! - He 's at the uplink tower . - Terrific . ( Ripley ) Hicks ! Hicks ! Hicks ! ( Newt ) Help ! Help ! ( Ripley ) Hiiiicks , help us ! ( Newt ) Break it ! Break the glass ! - Break it , break it . - Yes . I 'll try . Uhn ! ( Impact almost silent ) Oh ! ( Creature skittering ) ( Glass jar rattling ) ( Newt ) Ripley ... - I 'm scared . - Me too . Stay here . ( Fire alarm sounds ) It 's the medlab . Hudson ! Vasquez ! - Meet me in the medlab . We got a fire . - ( Hudson ) We 're on our way . They 're coming , Newt . ( Newt screams ) ( Ripley grunts ) ( Newt continues screaming ) Ah ! Oh ... Aaah ! ( Ripley straining ) ( Screaming ) Shoot it out ! - Hudson ! - Jesus ! ( Ripley grunting ) Christ , kid , look out ! Fuckin ' die ... ( Ripley gasping for air ) ( Hicks ) - Over there . - Ready ? ( Vasquez ) - Yeah ! - Yeah ! ( Ripley gasping ) - Hudson ? ! Yeah , all clear . Nailed the other one . It 's history , man . Jesus . ( Gasping ) Burke ! ( Coughing ) It was Burke . I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now . It just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine if one of us was ... " impregnated " ... whatever you call it , and then frozen for the trip home . Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying . Me and Newt . Hey , wait a minute now , we 'd all know . Yes , the only way he could do it is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home . Namely yours . Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . Fuck . He 's dead . You 're dog meat , pal . This is so nuts . I mean , listen ... Listen to what you 're saying . It 's paranoid delusion . How- - It 's really sad . It 's pathetic . You know , Burke , I don 't know which species is worse . You don 't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage . - All right , we waste him . No offense . - No . He 's gotta go back . - They cut the power . - What do you mean they cut the power ? How could they cut the power , man , they 're animals ! I want you two with trackers checking the corridors . Move ! - ( Ripley ) Gorman , watch Burke . - Yeah , I got ' im . Newt , stay close ! - I 'll go this side . - You do that , man . ( Tracker pulsing ) ( Tracker pulsing ) - Anything ? - Somethin ' . ( Tracker beeping ) - It 's inside the complex . - You 're just reading me . No , no , it ain 't you . They 're inside-inside the perimeter . They 're in here . ( Ripley ) Hudson , stay cool . Vasquez ? ( Tracker begins beeping ) Hudson may be right . - Get back , both of you . - ( Hudson ) The signal 's weird . Must be interference or somethin ' . There 's movement all over the place ! Get back to Operations ! It 's game time . Newt ... ( Ripley ) Seal the door . ( Ripley ) Hurry . ( Hicks ) C 'mon , c 'mon ! Come on , get back . Work fast . Cover your eyes , Newt . Don 't look at the light . Movement . Signal 's clean . Range 20 meters . They found a way in . Something we missed . We didn 't miss anything . 18 . - 17 meters . - Something under the floor , not in the plans . I don 't know ! - 15 meters . - Ripley ! - Definitely inside the barricades . - Let 's go . - 13 meters . - That 's right outside the door . - Hicks , Vasquez , get back ! - Man , this is a big fucking signal . How you doin ' , Vasquez ? Talk to me . Almost there . That 's it . 12 meters . 11 ... - 10 ... - Then they 're right on us . - Nine meters . - Remember , short controlled bursts . Eight meters . Seven . - Six . - Can 't be . That 's inside the room . - It 's readin ' right , man . Look . - Well , you 're not reading it right . Five meters , man . Four ... What the hell ? - Oh , my God . Oh , sh ... - Give me the light . Aaaahhhh ! ( Hudson ) There they go , over there ! Get ' em ! ( Hudson ) C 'mon , c 'mon ! Do something , Gorman ! Look out , there 's more of ' em . Medical ! Get to Medical ! Do it ! - Now ! - ( Hicks ) Look out , Hudson ! Look out ! Ahh ! Now ! Burke ! ( Door locks ) Open this door . Burke ! Open it ! C 'mon , let 's go ! Fall back ! Die , motherfucker ! Burke ! Hudson ! Motherfucker ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! Come and get it , baby ! I 've got all day ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon , you bastards ! C 'mon , you too ! Oh , you want some of this ? Fuck you ! ( Hudson grunts ) Fuck you ! - Hicks ! Hicks ! - Hudson ? ( Hudson screams ) Come on , Hicks , go . It 's locked . Got it . Let 's go . Go , go ! ( Vasquez ) Move , Gorman ! Seal it ! Burke ! Goddamn you , open this door . ( Burke cries out ) - Get back . - Hurry up . - Gorman , get out of the way . - Ripley , this way ! What ? - Wait . Get behind me . - Whatever you 're gonna do , do it fast . - Hicks ! - ( Gorman ) Come on , let 's go . Move . Which way is it to the landing field from here ? This way . Go right . This way . This way . - Which way ? - Straight ahead and left . Bishop , do you read me ? Come in ! Over ! The ship is on its way ! ETA 16 minutes ! Good ! Stand by there , we 're on our way ! - Which way now ? - That way . No , wait . This way . You sure ? Vasquez , move ! - Right up here ! It 's just up here ! - Hicks ! - We 're almost there . - Newt , wait ! Newt ! ( Vasquez grunts ) Ow , ow ! Vasquez ! ( Grunting in pain ) Go . Oh ! Oh , no ! ( Banging ) Newt ! Up there . There 's a shortcut across the roof . Hicks ? ( Gun clicks ) ( Aliens hissing ) Oh , you always were an asshole , Gorman . ( Newt screams ) ( Ripley ) Newt ! Ripley ! ( Newt screams ) ( Ripley ) Newt ! Hicks ? Hicks , get her ! Hurry ! - Hold on , Newt . - I 'm slipping ! - Don 't let go ! - Ripley ! - Hold on . - Help ! Got ya . I got ya . ( Newt screams ) Newt ! No ! C 'mon , we can find her with this ! Stay where you are , Newt ! ( Newt , distant ) Ripley ! - We 're coming ! Ripley ! This way . She 's close . Newt ! Ripley ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? Newt ! - Here ! I 'm here ! - Where ? Newt . Are you OK ? - We need to cut it . - Climb down , honey . We 've gotta cut through . Newt ? Now don 't move . Stay very still . Okay ... We 're almost there . Hang in there , ok ? ( Tracker begins beeping ) - Hicks - I know ! - Hurry ! - I know ! I mean it ! ( Tracker beeping continues escalating ) Newt ? Newt , just stay still . ( Screams ) - Almost there ! - No ! No ! No ! - Let 's go ! - No ! They don 't kill you , they ... they don 't kill you , they- - - She 's alive ! She 's alive ! - All right ! I believe you . She 's alive . We 've gotta go . Now ! ( Aliens screeches ) ( Acid hissing on armor ) Hicks ... Get it off . Ah ! Get it off ! ( Hicks grunting in pain ) ( Ripley starts coughing ) ( Ripley coughing and Hicks groaning ) Here . Go . C 'mon , you can make it ! - Bishop , how much time ? - Plenty . 26 minutes . - We 're not leaving . - We 're not ? ( Locator beeping slowly ) Ripley ... I don 't wanna hear about it , Bishop . She 's alive . There 's still time . In 19 minutes , this area 's gonna be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska . - Hicks , don 't let him leave . - We ain 't going anywhere . - See you , Hicks . - Dwayne . It 's Dwayne . Ellen . Don 't be gone long , Ellen . ( Alarms blaring ) ( Computer ) Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have 15 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Attention .

Hey . We made it . I knew you 'd come . He 's gonna be all right . He 's just out . I had to give him another shot for the pain . We need a stretcher to carry him up to Medical . Ok . I 'm sorry if I scared you . That platform was just becoming too unstable . I had to circle and hope that things didn 't get too rough to take you off . Bishop ... - You did OK . - I did ?

Not bad for a human . ( Pod motors whirring ) Are we gonna sleep all the way home ? - All the way home . - Can I dream ? Yes , honey . I think we both can . - Sleep tight . - Affirmative . [ ENGLISH - US ] Come here . It 's all right . It 's over . I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? That could have been better . Look , I think ... Van Leuwen ? Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? I don 't have to . There have been people there over 20 years , and they never mentioned hostile organisms . - What people ? - Terraformers . Planet engineers . They set up big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a " shake 'n'bake " colony . How many colonists are there ? 60 , maybe 70 families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . - Lieutenant , am I right ? - We 're trained to deal with these situations . Then you don 't need me . We don 't know what 's going on out there . It may just be a downed transmitter , okay ? But if it 's not , I would like you there as an adviser , and that 's all . I don 't have time for this . I 've gotta get to work . I heard you 're working in the cargo docks . That 's right . - Running forklifts ? - So ? Nothing . It 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . And you , you little shithead , you 're staying here . They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . All right , gear up . Two minutes , people . Somebody wake up Hicks . - Coming around for a 709 . - Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . - That 's the atmosphere processor ? - That 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . We manufacture those , by the way . Ferro , take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . Hold at 40 . Hudson , try and get their CPU online . Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . - He 's comin ' in . I feel safer already . - Pendejo jerk-off . That 's everything , right ? All right , this is everything we can salvage out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got 1 5 of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . - Is that the only flame-thrower ? - It 's only half-full but it 's functional . Got another one that 's damaged . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 1 7 days . 1 7 days ? I don 't wanna rain on your parade , but we 're not gonna last 1 7 hours . Those things are gonna come in here just like before ... This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . Right ? - Why don 't you put her in charge ? - You 'd better deal with it . Just deal with it , because we need you and I 'm sick of your bullshit . I want you to get on a terminal and call up a floor-plan file . Construction blueprints , anything that shows the layout . Are you listening ? I need to see air ducts , electrical access tunnels , sub-basements , every possible way into this complex . - We don 't have much time . - OK . I 'm on it . Just relax . I 'll be in medlab . Check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . This service tunnel must be how they move back and forth . That 's right . It leads from the processing station right into the sub-level here . Come down on that . OK , come over . Go back ... OK , punch that in right there . No . It 's back here . There 's a pressure door at this end . We could weld it shut . That should hold them for a while . But we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . That 's right . So we repair the barricades at these two intersections , and weld plate steel over these ducts here , here and here . That should seal off Medlab and Operations . Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . - OK , let 's move like we got a purpose . - Affirmative . We 're sealing the tunnel . Come on , baby . For what it 's worth . I want you to put this on . - What 's it for ? - It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . It 's just a precaution . - Thanks . - It doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . OK , what 's next ? Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now , you have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to sleep . I have scary dreams . I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her . She doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters , no real ones . - But there are . - Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Here . The acid oxidizes after the creature 's death , completely neutralizing . That 's very interesting , but it doesn 't get us anywhere . I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists and immobilize them to be hosts for more of these . Which means there would have to be a lot of these parasites . - One for each colonist . Over 1 00 at least . - That follows . But each of these things comes from an egg , right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . I want these specimens destroyed when you 're done . Is that clear ? Mr. Burke wants them kept alive for return to the company labs . He was very specific about it . I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . I want you two walking perimeter . Listen . We 're all in strung-out shape . But stay frosty and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . I don 't wanna hear it . She 's alive . There 's still time . In 1 9 minutes , this area 's gonna be a vapor cloud . - Don 't let him leave . - We ain 't going anywhere . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You have 1 5 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . - Sleep tight . - Affirmative . [ ENGLISH - US ]

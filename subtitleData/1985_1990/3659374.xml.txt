That 's what she 's like , an Odessa girl , A delicate , lively Odessa girl , She dances and sings , The kisses she brings To those who with merriment rings ! Daddy , daddy , what are we to do When the freezing cold comes ? You have no warm kerchief , You have no winter coat ! How is our exemplary student ? Our exemplary student went for a walk . Vovka , go buy bread . I forgot to . Yes , and buy some macaroni . Comrade , there 's a man there who says he 's an alien . - We have to do something . - Call the ambulance . I will , but he 's all but barefoot , he may catch a cold . - Hello . - Hello . Sorry , I smell bad . It 's cold . I took this from an iron box . Good for you . Friend , tell me the number of your planet in the Tentura , or at least the number of your galaxy in the Spiral . Because I mixed up contacts and can 't return home now . We don 't know the number . We forgot it , dear . The boy will go and call the information , and we 'll wait for him in a bread shop . All right ? Meanwhile , put this on . Oh , thank you . Listen , friends . Forget the bread shop , forget the information . This is my planet . UZM 247 in the Tentura . Beta Galaxy in the Spiral . This is the machine for moving over in space . Which contact shall I push to move back home ? Because time is relative . You must know that ? We have a suggestion : We push the contacts and move to your place . But if the machine doesn 't work , then you will move where we move you . Is it a deal ? No , we can 't . - One should know . - We can . - What do you see ? - Sand . So that bullshit worked . And that goat with holes , did he stay back there ? Stay cool . There 's the sun . There 's the sand . There 's gravitation . Where are we ? We are on Earth . - Or ... - Or ? Let 's suppose we 're on Earth , in a desert . The Kara Kum ? What other deserts do we have ? - Gobi , Sahara . - I said , we have . We have Kyzyl Kum , too . No , let 's suppose it 's Kara Kum . All right . The sun is in the west . So Ashkhabad must be there . Got it ? Let 's go . Come on ! Come on ! With Olga MASHNAYA Irina SHMELYOVA Lev PERFILOV , Anatoly SERENKO Comrade , what 's your name ? Vladimir Nikolayevich . And I 'm Gedevan . Nice meeting you . Starring Stanislav LYUBSHIN as Mashkov Yevgeny LEONOV as Uef Yuri YAKOVLEV as Bi Levan GABRIADZE as Gedevan Do you remember what number did he say , the one who got my sock ? No , I don 't . Maybe we 're on the planet from which he moved to ours ? Look , violinist , whatever we may guess , we won 't know a damn thing . We 've chosen the direction , and we 're walking . First thing we must get to the water . You get it ? Vladimir Nikolayevich , I 'd like to put my slippers on . Put them on ! You have to stop then ! What time is it ? - Four o 'clock . - At night ? At night . Are you being late ? It 's so embarrassing . I called from the airport and said I 'd come in an hour , and now ... You study at the conservatory ? No , it 's not mine . It 's Professor Rogozin 's . He was giving us a sponsor concert , and then they forgot to put his violin in the plane . - It was a banquet ? - No , a dinner . - You from Tbilisi ? - From Batumi . I thought I 'd give him the violin and catch the last electric train . I study in Ivanovo , at a textile school . I took entrance exams for the Institute of International Relations , but they said that I 'm ... Quiet . Koo ! A human . Koo ! - Koo . - Hello . Koo ! Capitalist country . Koo ! Koo ! Koo ! You know foreign languages ? English . A little bit of French . Tell them we don 't have any money . Tell them . They want us to pay . Gentlemen , sorry ! We haven 't money . Now ! Koo . Hello . We 're our tourists . We 've lost our group . Give us a lift to town , then we 'll manage somehow . Translate . Do you speak English ? Koo ? - Parlez vous Francais ? - Koo ? Hi . Do you speak English ? Parlez vous Francais ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? Koo ? Chatl . No money . Money , documents , currency , - our guide has got all . Well , this is the situation . We stepped aside for a second and got lost in the sands . Ku . Here . It 's warm . Koo ? - I beg your pardon ? - Koo . You want the hat ? You 're welcome . This is not mine , I can 't give it . There 's nothing inside . Open it . It 's not wine , it 's vinegar . Koo ! - Ku ! - Sour , isn 't it ? Is it a deal , friend ? Will you give us a lift ? Violinist , hurry up . Only to the nearest town , then we 'll manage ourselves . Koo ! The sweater ? Bastards ! Good I didn 't give them the violin . They got ashamed . Ketse ! Ketse ! Ketse ! - Ketse what ? - Ketse . Ketse . I think he wants a match . - Want a match ? - Ketse ! Here . Koo ? - The whole box ? - Koo ! First take us out of here , then we 'll give you koo . Not a single letter , not a single " made in " . Koo ! - Sorry , I don 't understand . - Koo ! Sprechen Sie Turkish ? Ku ! Koo . What do they want ? They want koo . Tsak . Thank you . Tsak . He wants me to put on the bell . He 'll do without . Tsak . Tsak . It 's not nice . I 'll put it on . Go ahead . Tsak ! Tsak ! Tsak ! Tsak ! All right , you 've talked me in . Jingle ! Jingle ! Koo ! Koo ! - Koo . - Koo . Koo . Koo . Koo . Koo ! Koo . Koo . I want a smoke , let me pass . - Ketse ! Ketse ! - Easy , easy ! Ketse ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , perhaps after all , we 're on ... Yeah , they 're typical Martians . Ku ! Oh , dear Lyusia , damn you , what did you need those macaroni for ? Well ... So we know Russian ? Why were you hiding that ? We 're not hiding anything . It 's hard to dig in a language when you think in two languages at once . And this patsak speaks languages he doesn 't know how to continue . What are you staring at , maimuno verishvilo ? - They know Georgian too . - What did he say ? - Monkey , son of a donkey . - All right ... We 're from the Soviet Union , here on a cultural exchange program . Our people know where we are , they 're looking for us . If you don 't give us the opportunity to get in touch with our embassy , you 'll be in big trouble . - You got it ? - Tsak . Koo . We don 't understand " embassy " . Put on the tsak , quick . So you understand macaroni , you understand maimuno , and what the embassy is , you don 't know , poor things . Don 't you bullshit us , all right ? You were thinking about macaroni , and I just said it . It 's not Earth , and not Africa , my dear . This is the Planet Plyuk . 215 in the Tentura . Galaxy " Kin-Dza-Dza " in the Spiral , all right ? There we go . Just great ! Put on the bell , my dear . Put it on . There you go ... Good boy . Koo ! Excuse me , where have we landed ? He got very keen ears . You know the tentura of your planet ? The tentura ? Well , tell me the number of your galaxy in the spiral . - In the spiral ? - Yes . You know where Earth is ? It 's where planets spin , such as ... Venus , Saturn , Mars , Jupiter . What other planets ? The Great Bear . Vladimir Nikolayevich , come here . Do you have more matches on your planet ? We 'll find some . How many will you give us if we lay you there ? - How many do you need ? - Two full boxes like this . - Seven . - Seven . And give me what you 've got now . I 'll buy a gravitsappa for them . Excuse me , what is gravitsappa ? Gravitsappa is without what a pepelats can fly only like this , and with a gravitsappa it can fly to anywhere in the universe in 5 seconds . Guys , how do you roll the pepelats out of the garage without a gravitsappa ? We had a gravitsappa , but after we flew in here , it was stolen . Don 't you have the machine for moving over in space ? - No . - No . Give me the matches . Give me the water . - Ku ! - Ku ! - Ku ! - Ku ! Like this ! You should do like this ! You should do it like this ! Like this ! It 's yours . Smoke like this now . - Thanks . - Koo ! Koo ! He says he has a gravitsappa . Put the matches here . When you lay us on Earth , you 'll get this and this . What ? Let 's go , violinist , into outer space . Wait ! Give it back . - Give it back ! - You 'll get it on our Mother Earth . Vladimir Nikolayevich , you said if we got you there you 'd give us everything . And you stole our match . A patsak never cheats on a patsak . It 's not nice , my dear . I said , to town . - And what is this ? - A barn . And what is this ? And what is this ? And what is this ? Isn 't it a town ? Stop jerking . Show us your gravitsappa . If it 's a quality product , we 'll take it . Patsak ! What idiots would take contraband goods in front of witnesses , when you can get for it a life etsikh with nails ? What have you got in your head : Brains or ku ? ! We 'll buy it ourselves . Let 's go . Halt ! Halt , I said ! Who are you ? Who are you , I 'm asking ? - An alien foreman . - No ! You 're a patsak ! - And who are you ? - I 'm a Georgian . No , you 're a patsak , too ! You 're a patsak , you 're a patsak , and he 's a patsak . And I 'm a chatlian , and they 're chatlians . So put the tsak on and sit in the pepelats , all right ? What ? Look at me with the visor , dear . Which dot is responding ? The green one . Now look at him . Green , too . Yours is green , too . Now look at Uef . What dot is it ? Orange . Because he 's a chatlian . Understand now ? - What ? - Plyuk is the chatlian planet . That 's why we , patsaks , must wear tsaks . And before us , chatlians , one must do like this ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , this is a flagrant racism . Show me once again . Like this ! - Do me a favor , slower . - Like this ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , you got a wife at home , a D-pupil son . You haven 't paid up for your cooperative apartment . And you 're bullshitting us here . You may end up bad , my dear . Here ! All right , violinist , let 's play their games . Good boy . Now give the match to Uef , and he 'll buy the gravitsappa . - He said he wanted all of them . - I was kidding . You 're jolly fellows . - Koo ! - Wait . Koo ! We 'll go together . Don 't show them your ketses and don 't think about them . Show my ketse and don 't give them more than a half match . The gravitsappa costs a half match . And your patsak said it cost a whole match . He was kidding too . The cement is of the 300 grade . Remember , patsak , a half or even less . All right . Excuse me , chatlians and patsaks , is it a nationality ? No . - A biological factor ? - No . - Persons from other planets ? - No . And what 's the difference between them ? Are you a color-blind person ? Can 't you tell green color from orange ? Some tourist ! A skyscraper . Come on ! Koo ? Koo ! Do as I told you . Hi , Miss . Aren 't you cold in your coat ? They won 't let me in . They only let you go . Don 't give them the ketse . Bring the gravitsappa here , I 'll look at it . Go . Not you . - We 're together . - No . Vladimir Nikolayevich , tell him ! All right . Wait here . But don 't go anywhere . Hi ! How you doing ? You want me to sit down ? Well , as a courtesy to the ladies present . Well , what 's new on Plyuk ? Put down the ketse , you 'll get the gravitsappa . A half . A half . - May I have a look ? - Look . Well , I 'm not an expert on those gravitsappas . Let 's go and show it to my chatlian , he 'll check it . We 'll put the tsapa in . A sore throat ? Water . I have a suggestion : I give you the rest of the ketse , you give me two bottles of water . All right . Got any food ? Porridge . What kind ? Plastic . All right , I give you this whole ketse , you give me five bottles of water and a kilo of porridge . - What 's this ? - Ketse . - Have to check it again . - Check it . Koo ! Hey , just a second ! Wait . Violinist , can you get matches on Earth ? Yes , I can . If you spit farther , I 'll give you a half chatl . Here . With this plyuk . If I spit farther , you 'll give me two matches . - Understand ? - No . A very simple game . I give you a half chatl , you give me three matches on Earth . Here ! - Spit , son . - I don 't want to . All right , you give me one match , and I give you 3 chatls , yellow pants and this big head start . - Come on . - No . - Blue pants . - No , I will do it on no conditions . Is it your rear word ? Why are you snowjobbing me , then ? Maimuna verishvila ! Mister Uef , I 'm a representative of a civilized planet . And I demand that you watch your vocabulary ! Where are they ? - Who ? - The one with a scar . I , the idiot , gave him all the matches . Ku ! Ku ! Ku ! Stop it , guys , enough . Enough ! What 's enough ? I 've told him a thousand times we have to fly to the center . But he 's as greedy as all chatlians ! Two chatls cheaper ! Ku ! We got one more . As far as I understand , it 's enough for a gravitsappa . Give it here . - Why ? - To buy a gravitsappa . Where ? Over there , at the center . How can you carry us to Mother Earth if you even don 't know in which galaxy it spins ? Any planetarium at the center , idiot , will give us the number of your planet for two chatls . Give me the match , come on ! And then you 'll bury us in sand , right ? - So you 're not giving it ? - No . Is that your rear word ? It can 't be any rearer . Then farewell , my dear . They 'll fly away . They 'll be back . They 'll cut each other 's throats for a match . Either you 're giving us this match right now , or we won 't lay you on Earth for less than 7 matchboxes . Two thousand . Three . Twenty three hundred . Three . Twenty five hundred , I can 't give any more . You can , my dear . Mister Bi . I 've got 50 rubles . The price of matches is 2 kopecks a box . Therefore , I can buy twenty five hundred . The violinist is cheating , he got more chatls . Mister Uef , I 'm not a violinist to you . My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich . Is the engine there ? Don 't poke your nose into every hole , Gedevan Alexandrovich . Gedevan , let 's tie these jerks up and head north . Why ? Who knows , perhaps the Mediterranean is lapping over there . Are you off your rocker , my dear ? How can Plyuk have any seas ? They 'd been made into luts long ago . Excuse me , into what ? Into fuel , violinist , into fuel . - Here . You owe us 6,140 matchboxes . - Why so many ? You gobbled the porridge , you drink the water . Plus the contraption . Cross the contraption out , we 're not taking the contraption . Put it down . Let 's take it . At least we 'll bring back some technology . Otherwise they won 't believe us . Then give him the violin , if you want it so much . The violin is Italian . 18th century . It costs 1,000 rubles , if not more . How am I going to pay for it ? Koo ? Koo . Violinist , instead of thinking all the time that you 're the first Georgian cosmonaut and that you 'll get a Nobel Prize , give back the spoon you stole from the destitute artists . I was thinking nothing of the sort . I wanted to give it to the Institute of Non-ferrous Metals as something new . O heavens ! The heavens have never seen such an ignominious patsak as you , violinist . It grieves me deeply . - Where 're you going ? - To the toilet . You can 't go to the toilet with money . Leave the money here , Gedevan Alexandrovich . - The ketse 's very expensive , my dear . - Why ? How do you figure it out on your Earth who before whom should sit down and how many times ? Well , just by eye . Savages . Look , I sort of like you , so I 'll teach you . If I have a few ketses , I have the right to wear yellow pants and a patsak must sit down before me not one , but two times . If I have many ketses , I have the right to wear crimson pants and then a patsak must sit down before me two times , and a chatlian must do koo , and an etsilopp has no right to beat me at night . Never ! I have a suggestion , my dear . You give us the match now and we 'll bring you yellow pants later , all right ? Thanks , I 've got them already . Perhaps the violinist needs them ? Violinist , those aliens are pushing black market pants here ! Yellow ! You want some ? The violinist is not here , my dear . - What do you mean ? - I 've ejected him . Don 't worry , Vladimir Nikolayevich , we got another catapult , a new one . The old one was not good anyway . I beg your pardon ? I pressed the kapa , and he flew away . We don 't need the violinist , dear . He just eats up fuel . Turn it back . We can 't . We 're out of luts , we have to fly to a luts station . Turn it back ! Or I 'll burn this ketse to hell ! Gedevan ! Violinist ! Violinist ! - Where can he be ? - I 've told you . He was caught by the etsilopps . - Let 's fly , dear . - Death would be too good for you ! Radio the etsilopps . We don 't have a radio . We threw it out . - I 'll check it . - An etsilopp ! Put on the tsak . Put on the tsak ! He 'll do without . Koo ! Koo . Put it on . He 'll trankluate both you and the match . Koo . Koo ! Hello . Look , friend , we 've lost our boy . - Haven 't you seen him ? - Koo . What ? Koo ! Sorry , I forgot . They say you picked him up . Koo . Didn 't I tell we don 't need the violinist ? Didn 't I ? ! What are we going to buy luts with now ? With what ? ! What a bastard you are , dear . He 's even worse , he 's just a ku ! I have a suggestion . We 'll find the violinist and fly to the local government . Bring some sand , dear . We 'll tell them who we are and from where . They 'll give us a gravitsappa . And we ... will make a mutually profitable trade-in . You 'll give us yellow pants , we 'll give you as many ketses as you want . To fly to the government , you need to have a gravitsappa . The government lives on another planet , dear . Uncle Vova , I 'm here ! Here ! - Violinist ! - What ? - Where 's my ... what 's its name ... - Tsak ? Well ? - I got it . - Then give it to me . - What do you need it here for ? - Give it to me , I said . There 's no one here . - This is mine . - Keep it ready . Are you sleeping ? No . Cheer up . If there 's a gravitsappa on this Plyuk , we 'll get it . We used to get even more valuable things . Stay cool . Hey , stop ! Koo ! Give us a lift to the center ! - Stop , patsak . - What ? Don 't come closer . - What do you want ? - Take us to the center . Three chatls . No money . But we 'll work for it . What can you do ? - Me ? I can do anything . - Exactly ? Vladimir Nikolayevich is a builder , a foreman . We 'll build you a house ! And what can you do ? Me ? He can play the violin ! Play . - Play . - I can 't play . Bye , patsaks . Wait , Miss , I can play ! Play . Here ? Over there ! Wait , I 'll put on the sound . Play . And sing . Just a minute ! How does it go ... Mama , mama , what am I to do ? Super ! - What ? - I say , super . People like it . - What ? - People like it . No . - Let me play the drums . - Like what ? Foreman . We don 't need the violinist . He may come handy . Give us some water to drink . I said , after the performance . We could have just taken it . By force . Then you would 've begged for it . If you touch me , an etsilopp will fly in and pull your legs out . - I fuck your etsilopp . - Cool it , violinist . Don 't irritate the lady . Foreman . I got you , got you . Got you . Look , do you know someone with a gravitsappa and a pepelats ? Why ? He could lay us on Earth . We 'd give a crate of ketse to you and to him . I know you don 't believe words . What am I thinking now ? That your wife calls all the morgues . No , what am I thinking right this moment ? - That you 'll give . - So it 's true . What idiot on Plyuk would think the truth ? It 's absurd . Yes , because you say what you don 't think and think what you don 't think , that 's why you sit in cages , and that 's why all this wretched cataclysm that I 'm observing here , and Vladimir Nikolayevich , too . You were told that patsaks should perform in a cage , so it must be a cage . Why showing off ? It 's all right , dear , we can sing just next to it . Get in . He 's nabbed us . He 's trankluating . We 're not beasts . What ? ! - Yes , you will get in ! - Let go ! Let go ! Ku ! Koo ! Get in , or he 'll melt us ! All right , let 's come in , violinist , as long as they 're begging . Get in . One ... two ... three . Dance ! Dance . Find yourself another pop group , jerk ! What ? ! I 'll be right back . We have to split . Boys , give a push to the cart , there 's a rise here . That we 're always ready to do . Step on it . Bye . Vermin . I 'm going to tell everybody to what state that clown , Pezhe , has reduced the planet ! Patsaks are bossing chatlians around ! Ku ! What ? - Everything 's in there ? - She stole the perfume . A woman . Let me . - You got lead in there or what ? - Let me carry it , Uncle Vova . I don 't even know which way to look . Where 's Earth ? Galina Borisovna , as patsaks , comrade Mashkov and I could get two chatls for a performance , that 's the maximum . Water , luts and fines to etsilopps , - that made up at least a chatl a day . And the gravitsappa costs a half ketse , which amounts to 2,200 chatls . We divide it by 365 , subtract Saturdays and Sundays , and we get 6 . So I just couldn 't come back any sooner than in 6 years . That 's all very well , Gedevan Alexandrovich , but it 's just words . Where 's the proof that you came from outer space , and not just sold the violin , as Professor Rogozin claims , and operated all that time at a disco in Gagry ? Here 's the mineral . Here 's the chatl . Here 's the tsak . As for pebbles and sand , I enclosed them with my explanatory note and handed to Raya in the dean 's office , for her to send it to UNESCO . - Where ? - To UNESCO . You 're a grownup man , Gedevan Alexandrovich . You finished one semester and then disappeared for years . Now you show up with a rock , with a fragment of the Caucasian ceramics and a fishing bell . And you 're claiming that ... Besides , if you can play music , why didn 't you take part in our amateur talent shows ? Excuse me , violinist , but this is an elementary koo ! End of Part One Part Two Short Chatlian-Patsak Dictionary KETSE - a match TSAK - a bell for the nose ETSIKH - a bin for prisoners ETSILOPP - a representative of the authorities PEPELATS - a spaceship GRAVITSAPPA - a detail of the pepelats engine KU - an obscenity accepted by society KOO - all other words - Hi ! - Hello . Long time no see . Bye . Hey , wait a second . I have a suggestion . What ? What are we thinking about you ? Come on . Penetrate our brains . Why are you badgering us ? What do you want ? - Have you no shame ? - And what about you ? We 're just poor , wretched , hungry artistes . Have we done you any wrong ? Why are you pursuing us ? Give me your contraption . Tune it up . Good . Come on . One , two , three . Mama , mama , what am I to do ? Koo ! Mama , mama , how am I to live ? I have no warm coat , I have no warm underwear . Shut up . You have no ear . Mama , mama , what am I to do ? Koo ! Mama , mama , how am I to live ? Uncle Vova , do it again . - They like it . - They dig it . One , two ! An etsilopp ! Koo ! Koo ! Artistes , where 's our pigsty ? - The pepelats ? - Yes . Over there . - We 're out of luts . - Because of you , bastard . Violinist , what are you doing ? Hoodlum ! - Leave me alone . - My dear . This is the last breath . A grave . Cemetery . Checkmate . - And you said you had high rating . - He 's a braggart . You win at the expense of my brains . If you had brains , you 'd be at the International Institute now , instead of bullshitting us here . Let 's play again . You stake the violin , the case and the tooth stick . And this . All right ? All right . And you - the contraption , the visator and Mr. Uef 's lifeblood . - It 's possible . - Come on . Uncle Vova . You should fix the tsappa . - Here , do it yourself ! - I can 't , I 'm a chatlian . Get out of here ! When it comes to giving advice , they are all chatlians , but when it 's work ... - Kindermate . - Unfair play . You deliberately thought out my moves badly . You should play with your own brains . How can he play with his brains if he 's seeing those dolls for the first time ? None of my business . Give me my win . No way . Uef , have you ever seen such a little patsak being so mercenary a ku ? Never . I said we didn 't need the violinist . Here 's the result . Hey , boss ! And you said , the tsappa . Does no one sing in cages on your planet ? Mister Bi , on Earth only beasts are put in cages . The beasts , are they chatlians ? I don 't know . But it looks like it . So the nightingale is a patsak ? Why patsak ? You said yourself that he sings without a cage . So he 's a patsak . You see ? ! You got as flagrant a racism as it is here , on Plyuk . Only power was seized not by chatlians , but by patsaks , such as you and your friend , the nightingale . Let me do it . Here , four gulps . Water for the kid . You owe us 6,042 matchboxes . Violinist , write it down . I have already . Want it ? No . It 's free . What are you doing ? What about me ? What about me ? What about me ? What about me ? I 'm giving 10 more matchboxes . Have some water . Kin-dza-dza ! - A motorboat ! - It 's not a motorboat . It 's a luts station . - Let 's fill up . - No ! It 's automatic , but the next one has a woman . We 'll perform , she 'll give us a discount . Stop loafing , Uncle Vova . Come on , dear , let 's fly . If there had been a sea here , why are there no shells ? Do you still have seas on Earth ? We have seas , and we have rivers . And we have decent people too , Mister Uef . Savages ! I feel like crying . Mama , mama , what am I to do ? Mama , mama , how am I to live ? I have no warm coat , I have no warm underwear . Koo ! Too bad my bosses can 't see me now . They would 've given me a raise . Quiet , Uncle Vova . She 's looking at us . Koo ? Koo ? Koo ! They took the woman out and put a machine in . Take as much as we can afford . We 'll fly a part of the way at least . The luts is not sold by parts . The luts costs 10 chatls a charge . And we got only 7 . Koo ? How far is it to the center from here ? 160 kilometers . Uncle Vova , Uef has more chatls . In his right galosh . Hey , chatlian ! What ? Come on , take your right felt boot off . Why ? Come on , koo , koo . Ku ! Koo ? Ku , you pest ! Sit down ! Why ? They 're not etsilopps . It 's Pezhe with his patsak . You don 't sit down - you get an etsikh with nails for life . And who is he ? There , did you see it ? It 's holography , my dear ! The violin ! Cool it ! Freeze ! Quiet ! And you said koo . It 's not a dirigible , blockhead . It 's the last breath of Mr. Pezhe . Bullshit . One man couldn 't breathe out so much air before his death . It 's absurd . Don 't you fear the wrath of heavens ? ! Pezhe is alive , and I 'm happy . And I 'm even happier . Koo . Koo . This way . Come on , get in . - Plastic ? - No . Don 't they have a decent entrance to this supermarket ? You have to pay chatls for a decent entrance , my dear . Koo . Koo ! Koo . - Let 's go . - Get away ! Ku . Violinist , patsaks ride in there . - Koo . - Koo . What are they doing ? It 's Mr. Pezhe 's fourth pump . I love Pezhe so much ! And I koo him even more ! Koo ! Koo ! Here they make water out of luts . Koo ! Koo ! - What are they yelling ? - They 're selling . - What are they selling ? - Everything . Let 's take a gravitsappa . Gravitsappas are in another section . First we must know the tentura of Earth . Yellow pants , two koos . Koo , koo . Koo ! Koo ! Think the orbit 's diameter of your planet . I don 't remember . You think , violinist . No , we don 't need the violinist . You think . All right . Think the specific gravity of your planet 's core . The specific gravity ? No , I don 't remember . All right , I see . Think the names of the planets you know in your galaxy . Jupiter , Mars , Saturn , Venus . There was the crystal of introduction ! Where 's the crystal of introduction ? Violinist , put it back ! I thought it was nothing . Just a piece of glass . You damn fool . Enough of gritting your brains , you dolt . There 's your planet , 013 in the tentura , to the left of Big Bear . If you want to talk , pay another chatl . - Pardon ? - Think your phone number , koo . And say about matches into it . Koo . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Talk into here . Hello ? Hello ? Who is it ? Hello ? Talk . The time 's ticking . Hello ? Lyusia , can you hear me ? It 's me ! Vova , where are you ? ! I 'm here . How are you ? How is Kirill ? Where are you , Vova ? I 'm here , it 's some place . I 'll explain to you later . How 's mother feeling ? Did you visit her ? I did . But where are you ? Listen , you patsak girl . Stop this bullshit . Go and buy 2 crates of ketse , or we 'll find him another ... Go away ! Lyusia ! Lyusia ! Lyusia , my dear ! Lyusia ... Lyusia , take the phone , call Manokhin and tell him that the keys from the bathroom equipment are in my wagon , on the floor under the locker . - Did you understand everything ? - Yes , I understood everything . Connect me , please , to Batumi , 3-47-57 . Tell them to get Alik . No . Lay off , you thief . Koo . Koo . Something wrong ? Nothing wrong . Only Earth is far away . We have to warm up for 7 minutes instead of 5 . So let 's go and prepare the tsappa for the gravitsappa . Astronauts , which one is the tsappa ? The rusty nut over there , my dear . You got everything rusty here . That one is the rustiest . Are you absolute nuts ? ! Oh-oh-oh , oh boy , Lyusia and Manokhin shifted in space . What do you know ! Uncle Vova ! The match is in the cap ! It 's strange . Why did they fly ? They got the match to buy a gravitsappa , and they know Earth 's tentura . Comrade etsilopp ! Comrade etsilopp ! They 've stolen our things ! Catch them ! Koo ! Catch them ! 40 chatls . No chatls . Our guide got everything . And the violin is not theirs ! They didn 't koo 'd before the video Pezhe . Why are you staring ? Why are you staring ? I 'll report to your bosses that you knew and took no action . They 'll tranklucate you to hell ! I did take action , I pressed the kappa right away . The violinist is my witness . To all posts ! Bring the pigsty with wheels here . Koo . There 's nothing in there . Open it . Show him . It 's vinegar . None of your business . I 'll tranklucate the patsak , the chatlian will get an etsikh with nails for life . Brothers , brothers , my dear patsaks , tell the truth , how I did sit-downs , how this chatlian pressed the kappa . Shut up . Uncle Vova ! - Parasite ! - Shut up yourself ! Vova , my friend ! Gedevan Alexandrovich , genatsvale ! Tell that it was him . - No ! - He didn 't sit down . - I 'll give you the pepelats . - Uncle Vova , the pepelats is mine ! Cool it , cool it . Just a second . No one cursed anyone . Everybody did sit-downs like monkeys . I made a mistake . And it was me who brought the ketse . What ketse ? The match you took out of the cap . There was no match , no match . Uncle Vova , what are you saying , my dear ? Sorry , I forgot . There was no match . No match . Both get an etsikh without nails for life , until they pay up . The pay-up is 500 chatls , 250 apiece . Thank you ! Patsak , glue up the violin and sing songs , violinist ! Guys , it was a joke about the match , we just wanted to please you ! On the river , on the river , On a steep river bank Koo Marusya with white ... Hello , Earthman ! I 'm sure one day you 'll fly to this planet , too . Greetings to you from Vladimir Nikolayevich Mashkov , a builder from Moscow , and Gedevan Aleksidze from Batumi , the first men to set their feet on those lousy sands at the backyard of Universe . Brother patsak , throw in more of your ruberoid , you got only water there . Tell him to give me something else . Who knows , maybe at that time somebody who knew me would be still alive . Tell them that I didn 't steal the violin . Look , it 's as good as new . There 's one more piece . It happens . Sometimes . Lots of calories ? Earthmen , who presses like that ? I had a hard time finding you . Good thing there 's memory . Here 's your sock . Thanks . If you want , I can move you over to Earth . I now know your number in the tentura . But hurry up , because one second here equals a half-year there . All right , we press it to Earth now , get the matches , come back and trade them for our guys . - We go to Moscow , you go home . - I can 't . There 're only 3 charges . That 's great . Just enough for going there , here and back . And what about me ? - Listen , friend ... - Koo . - Koo ! - Koo ! Koo . Make your mind , yes or no ? To the count of 3 . One . - Wait . - Two . Put yourself in my place . They 're sitting there because of me . And my little son has got that big a beard now . Two and a half . Two and a half ! No , I can 't do it this way . Three . Who needs all that ? ! Tsaks , tsaraks - it 's all garbage ! Where did you get this ? It lay idle on a shelf at the planetarium . Violinist , my dear kleptomaniac , you filched a gravitsappa . Patsaks . Patsaks ! Why are you performing here standing ? You can do it standing only over there . The etsilopp didn 't let us there . Here you may do it only on your knees . Never mind , we 're fine like this ... Pay up . All right . Come on , behave yourself . Koo . Uncle Vova . Your coat matches my hat . Hi ! How you doing ? What 's new on Plyuk ? Sing . I 'm not in good voice today . Sing . Koo ! Koo ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , I can 't go on anymore . Stay cool , violinist . - How much is this ? - One hundred . We seem to have sung right . - And this ? - 50 . All right ... An etsilopp . Koo . Patsaks , why aren 't you with muzzles ? Turn around . Mister Pezhe has ordered all patsaks to wear muzzles . And rejoice . All right , this is for me . And this is for you . And this is for you . Why aren 't you rejoicing ? I 'm talking to you ! Come on , raise your tranklucator , chatlian . - Put it on . - Yes , sir . And rejoice . I 'm rejoicing ! Oh , look , Pezhe is here ! Where ? Get up ! Get up ! Open your mouth . Wider . Violinist , the gag . Hurry ! Turn around ! Your nose ! Give us the money . Here , hold it like this . Take it off , too . If you just think that this junk is not a tranklucator , it 's going to be the last thought in your chatlian head . Take the shortest route to the etsikh now ! All lie down for half an hour ! - Straight ahead ! - Straight ahead ! Move it ! - Koo ! - Excuse me , granny . She 's Pezhe 's mother . Pezhe 's mother ! Pezhe 's mother . Koo . Koo . A video ? Himself . Everybody into the trough ! Move it ! Open the door . And stay there for 24 hours ! Do you koo or not koo ? Koo . Here . Koo ! - Koo . - Koo ! - Which number ? - The last one . Koo ! Hello . Hey , chatlian , sing ! Cut it out , violinist . Roll out the last but one . - Ku ! - Vanish ! Hello , Gedevan Alexandrovich . Gomardzhoba . Get out . - We can 't . - They 'll catch us . Wait . We got a gravitsappa . Koo , Uncle Vova ! Koo , koo . Cut it . Here . Koo ! Push it ! Uncle Vova , help me to roll the etsikh out ! Forget it ! Vladimir Nikolayevich ! Mankind 's worked for thousands of years for the sake of a pebble from the Moon , and here we have a live ET and an etsikh made of unknown metal ! Forget it , I said ! Koo . Koo . Koo . Koo . Koo . - The tsappa . - Yes , the tsappa . The tsappa ! - Press the tsappa ! - I did ! Koo ! - Are we flying ? - We 're starting it up . Hurry up , they may come to any minute ! Don 't be in the way . We 've landed . Landed where ? Khanud ! What Khanud ? - The planet I was born on . - Me too . - It 's nighttime . - It 's always nighttime here now . - Put this on . - What for ? There 's no bloody air here . How can you live here ? No one lives here anymore . The Plyukans tranklucated us while we were on tour . - For what ? - For not tranklucating them sooner . And them , what for ? For looming overhead . - So everyone had died ? - Sure . Vova , I have a suggestion . The planet Khanud costs just kopecks now . 63 chatls . A month of singing " mama " around the galaxy , and the planet 's in our pocket . Another month , and we can buy the air . 93 chatls . Everybody with no air will pour down here . The air is ours ! They 'll be crawling on all fours and we 'll just spit on them . - What for ? - Just to enjoy it . Is it something to enjoy ? You 're too young yet . Half the planet is yours , the other half is ours , all right ? It 's tempting , of course . But we need to go to Earth . Let 's hurry , in half an hour our supermarket will close . Don 't be so jumpy , Vova . Look here . We 're here . Earth is here . And this is Alpha . On Alpha they make cactuses out of us . Earth is in the anti-tentura , my dear . And we have no way of reaching it , understand ? - How come ? - That 's so . I 've been unlucky all my life . The pepelats just can 't get to Earth . So enough of blathering , all right ? Let 's go and divide the planet . Did you learn about it at the planetarium ? Yes , my dear . And that 's why you stole the match ? - Sure . - They 're lying , Uncle Vova ! Don 't believe them . Come on , take us to Earth . That 's it ! No , Gedevan , they 're not lying . For those matches they 'd crawl on all fours over the entire universe . Don 't you joke with that , Vova . There is only 2 % oxygen norm here . Gedevan ... Don 't do it . You 're young , you must live . Something might change yet . No one needs the violinist , Uncle Vova . Hey , patsak ! You 're going to kick the bucket anyway . Tell the truth just once in your life . Why didn 't you shift in space with that goat while you could ? What did you want ? Crimson pants ? Pezhe 's pool ? Tell me , what ? Gedevaniko , sonny . You tell me . You can tell me , I 'm like you . My mother was Georgian . Sadauri . Akhauri . He says his mother was a local Georgian . Uef ! Do as you like , but I 'm going to koo them to Alpha . Ku ! And you , stinking chatlian , put on the tsak and sit down when you 're talking to a patsak ! Khanud is a patsak planet , my dear . Koo . Repeat it again . You catapult us to Alpha , while you try to slow down in its orbit . - The hell you can slow down there . - Don 't interrupt . Go on , my dear . On Alpha , when they shift us to Earth , we are to press the shifting machine with a finger , so that we keep it with us . On Earth we are to buy for you four crates of matches . Go on , my dear . For how long do we have to sing the same song ? Let 's fly . Because of you I 'll have to sit in a pot forever ! You , too , could open your mouth for a change . Guys , my dear , wonderful guys , either we fly , or at least close the door . I can 't bear the sight of you anymore . I feel sick as it is . Bye , my dear . - Koo ! - Koo . - Koo ? - Koo ! We 're flying . Put on brakes ! Put on brakes ! Put on brakes ! How can I put on brakes when you 've drunk all the brake fluid , you alkie ! He 'll get poisoned . - Turn off your horns . - They don 't turn off . - Then take them off . - They 're going to break . It looks like we 've landed . It felt the same last time . All right ... Put on the gas mask . - And the tsak ? - They 'll do without . The Earth ! On the river , on the river , On the river ba ... No . It 's not the Earth . Hello . We 're patsaks from the planet Earth . And who are you ? This is the planet Alpha . Give your coordinates to Decont , she will shift you . Goodbye . Will you please tell me the number of your planet ? 013 in the tentura . It 's here , somewhere close . - Here . - Left of Big Bear . We don 't need that . Please , hold each other 's hands . Miss , where will those two go ... To the little branch of the greenhouse . Please , hold each other 's hands . Do you really make cactuses out of people ? - Only out of Plyukans . - Ours are Khanudans , not Plyukans . Makes no difference . Please , put on respirators . - Why ? You got good air . - That 's why . - Just look at her ! - Put it on , Gedevan . I 'm asking you on behalf of my planet . Please , let them go . Who has the authority to decide that ? Abradoks , but ... Then take us to him . Take us , or I 'll take the gas mask off and breathe out a lot of air here . You don 't have to worry . Our greenhouses have excellent conditions . Blossoming , microclimate , peace . One might only envy them . Then why , my dear , do you run here in the grass and not sit in a pot there ? Please , look under your feet , you 've already trampled three shoots . Friend . We 're asking for a favor . You may as well not continue . No . Our proximity to the Kin-dza-dza galaxy is our misfortune . They 're consumed with passions . Corrupt passions . To continue living as a vegetable is good for them . As for everybody else . Why not ask them ? They know better what 's good for them and what 's not . If we gave them the right to decide anything ... Are you the smartest ones here , girl ? Did someone tell you that , or you decided so on your own ? Let 's not waste time . You 're creatures from the antitentura . Therefore , I have to shift you to the point of your departure or send you back in time to the moment when you yourselves can decide your destiny . Make your choice . I beg your pardon , to what time ? To your past on Plyuk . Let 's do it like this : One goes to Earth , the other to the past . Vladimir Nikolayevich . I 'm not letting you go alone to Plyuk . Look , man , press the time . Was I gluing the violin for about 50 minutes ? Right , 50 . Listen , brother , the patsak with a sock is going to come now . Tell him to follow us to the etsikh . - You know where the etsikh is ? - Sure thing ! - Show him the way . - He must give me something else . Everybody rest for half an hour ! Thanks , dears . Koo . Play your games , men . Koo ! - Koo ! - Koo . Violinist , time ! You haven 't shifted back again , you pests . - Yeah , not again . Get out . - Like hell we will ! We 're better off here than on Alpha . Pull them out . The shifting machine will be here soon . You owe us 11,000 matchboxes , the violinist has it all written down . 11,020 . I have a suggestion , Vova . You and I shift to the supermarket . Then , after we buy everything ... There 'll be no then . We fly only as far as Earth . For good ? For good . Me going to the planet where they don 't know who should sit down before whom ? Give me the gravitsappa and you may do as you like . Uncle Uef , Uncle Bi , they 'll give you such a welcome ! No , genatsvale , the society that has no color differentiation of pants , has no goal , and if there 's no goal ... Enough philosophizing , he may appear any minute . Let 's make a decision . You go with us or what ? Give me the gravitsappa ! Give it to him . We shouldn 't have . Well ? Let 's say goodbyes . I sort of got used to you . Me too . Well , take care . Friends ! Patsaks . Here 's your sock , thanks . - If you want ... - Friend , what kind of system you got ? May I take a look ? It 's a regular system . You press the button and you 're home . Koo ! Hi . Hi . What 's new ? Manokhin got pipes burst on his site . That 's what she 's like , an Odessa girl , A delicate , lively Odessa girl . She dances and sings , The kisses she brings To those who with merriment rings ! Daddy , daddy , what are we to do When the freezing cold comes ? Yes , yes , you have no warm kerchief , You have no winter coat ! - How 's our exemplary student ? - Our exemplary student went for a walk . Vova , go buy bread . I forgot to . Yes , and buy some macaroni , too . Comrade , which way is Old Arbat ? - Over there , to the right . - Thank you . - Koo ! - Koo ! Violinist ? Uncle Vova ! Violinist ... Uncle Vova ... Mama , mama , what am I to do ... The End

 Bio-readouts are all in the green . Looks like she 's alive . There goes our salvage , guys . - How are we today ? - Terrible . - Well , better than yesterday , at least . - Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station , been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're OK . Looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy . Come here ! Hey , come here . How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ? Where have you been ? I guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Burke . Carter Burke . I work for the company . But don 't let that fool you . I 'm really an OK guy . I 'm glad you 're a little better . The weakness and disorientation should pass soon . It 's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? - Has no one discussed this with you yet ? - No . But , I mean , I don 't ... recognize this place . No , I know . Uh ... OK . It 's just that , uh , this might be a shock to you . It 's longer ... How long ? Please . 57 years . - What ? ! - You were out there for 57 years . You had drifted right through the core systems , and it 's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did . It 's one in a thousand , really . I think you 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . Are you OK ? Are you OK ? God ! Nurse ! Please ! Someone get in here now ! - No ! - Now ! - Hold ! - Please ! Hold her ! Kill me ! No ! No ! Bad dreams again ? You want something to help you sleep ? No . I 've slept enough . Jonesy . Come here . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's over . - Hi . Sorry I 'm late . - Is there any word about my daughter ? I think we should worry about the hearing now , cos we don 't have a lot of time . I read your deposition , and it 's great . If you stick to that , we 'll be fine . There are gonna be a lot of heavyweights there - feds , Interstellar Commerce Commission , Colonial Administration , insurance guys ... Do you have any news about my daughter ? We did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest ... Amanda Ripley-McClaren - married name , I guess - aged 66 . And that was at the time of her death . Which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy ... Um ... She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository , Little Chute , Wisconsin . No children . I checked . I promised her ... that I 'd be home for her birthday . Her 11th birthday . We have been here for three and a half hours . How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please . You admit to detonating the engines of , and thereby destroying , an M-Class star-freighter , a rather expensive piece of hardware . 42 million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account , in that , for reasons unknown , the Nostromo set down on LV-426 , an unsurveyed planet at that time . That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct , by you , - for reasons unknown . - Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down there on company orders to get this thing , which destroyed my crew . And your expensive ship . The analysis team , which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter , found no evidence of the creature you describe . Good ! That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn airlock . Like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft , an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds . " A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " These are your words . - " And has concentrated acid for blood . " - That 's right . Look , I can see where this is going . - But I 'm telling you that those things exist . - Thank you . That will be all . Please ! You 're not listening to me . Kane , the crew member ... Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs there . - Thank you , that will be all . - Goddammit , that 's not all ! Because if one of those things gets down here , you can kiss all this bullshit goodbye ! It is the finding of this court of enquiry that Warrant Officer E Ripley , NOC 14472 , has acted with questionable judgment , and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . No criminal charges will be filed , and you are released on your own recognizance for a six-month period of psychometric probation , to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . That could have been ... better . - Look , I think the ... Ripley ! - Van Leuwen ? Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . There have been people there over 20 years , and they never complained about any hostile organism . - What people ? - Terraformers . Planet engineers . They set up big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a " shake ' n ' bake " colony . How many are there ? Colonists ? 60 , maybe 70 families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . - I 'll be down in Maintenance , OK ? - Al ? - What ? - Hey , Al ? Remember you sent some wildcatters out into the middle of nowhere last week ? One of them 's on the horn , says he 's onto something . - Wants to know if his claim will be honored . - Why wouldn 't it be ? Because you sent them out there on company orders ? I don 't know . Christ ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference . We look . They don 't say why , and I don 't ask , because it takes two weeks to get an answer , and the answer is always " Don 't ask . " So what do I tell this guy ? Tell him as far as I 'm concerned , if he finds something , it is his . - Lydecker ? - What ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be on this level . Go on , get outta here . - You go in places we can 't fit . - So ? That 's why I 'm the best . Knock it off . I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again , I 'll tan your hides . - All the kids play in the ... - I don 't care ! Wait a minute . Annie , come and have look at this , will ya ? Folks , we have scored big this time . What is it , Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's see if we can get a closer look at it through that crack down the side . - Shouldn 't we call in ? - Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . That 's about as close as we can get . Shall we take a look inside ? You kids stay inside . I mean it . We 'll be right back . - OK . Bye . - Bye . Timmy , they 've been gone a long time . It 'll be OK , Newt . Dad knows what he 's doing . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control ! Hi , Ripley . This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps ... Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me at the wolves , and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . - Can I finish ? - No . There 's no way . Ripley , you wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I can guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . Lieutenant , am I right ? We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . Then you don 't need me . We don 't know exactly what 's going on out there . I would like you there as an adviser , and that 's all . What 's your interest in all this ? Why are you going ? The corporation co-financed that colony along with Colonial Administration . We 're into a lot of terraforming , building better worlds ... Yeah , I saw the commercial . Look , I 've gotta get to work . I heard you 're working in the cargo docks . - Running forklifts ? - Yeah . So ? Nothing . I think it 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . Yeah , if you go . Come on ! That 's a second chance , kiddo . I think for you it would be best to face this thing , get back on the horse ... Spare me , Burke . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . I know . I read it . You wake up every night , your sheets soaking with sweat ... I said no , and I mean it ! Now please leave . I am not going back , and ... I would not be any good to you if I did . OK . Would you do me a favor ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . Hello ? Ripley . - You OK ? - Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study , not to bring back , but to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right , I 'm in . And you , you little shithead ... You 're staying here . They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? Is that a joke ? Oh , I wish it were . Hey , Hicks . Man , you look just like I feel . OK , sweethearts , what are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the Corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm . Every meal 's a banquet , every paycheck a fortune , every formation a parade . - I love the Corps ! - Man , this floor is freezing . - Want me to fetch your slippers for you ? - Gee , would you , sir ? I 'd like that . Look into my eye . Fall in , people . Come on , let 's go . - I hate this job . - Crowe ! Wierzbowski ! On your feet ! You just had three weeks on your back . I 'm talkin ' about breathing , not this frozen shit . Yeah , Top , how about it ? All right , first assembly 's in 15 , people . Shag it ! Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . - Apparently she saw an alien once . - Whoopee-fucking-do ! - I 'm impressed . - ¡ Qué bonita ! Hey , Vasquez . Have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? Oh , Vasquez ! You 're just too bad . Hey , Top . What 's the op ? It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity ! Dumb-ass colonists ! - What 's this crap supposed to be ? - Corn bread , I think . - It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . - Hey . I sure wouldn 't mind gettin ' some more Arcturian poontang . Remember that ? - Yeah , Frost , but the one you had was male ! - Doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian , baby . - Hey , Bishop . Do the thing with the knife . - Oh , please . - Come on . - Do it , baby . - All right ! - I don 't wanna see that , man . - Hey , what are you doin ' , man ? - Don 't move . Just shut up . Bishop ? ! Hey , man ! - Do it , Bishop . - Not me , man ! - Yeah , you . - Quit messin ' around . Come on ! Trust me . - All right , knock it off . - Thank you . - Enjoy your meal . - That wasn 't funny , man . - Lieutenant Gorman ? Mr. Burke ? - Yeah , thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . The boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . Thought you never missed , Bishop . You never said anything about an android being on board . Why not ? It never occurred to me . It 's just common practice . - We always have a synthetic on board . - I prefer the term " artificial person " myself . - Is there a problem ? - I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't even ... Ripley 's last trip out , the synth ... the artificial person malfunctioned . There were problems , and a few deaths were involved . - I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? - Yeah , the Hyperdyne Systems 120-A / 2 . That explains it . The A / 2s always were a bit twitchy . That can 't happen with our behavioral inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm , or allow to be harmed , a human being . You sure you don 't want some ? You just stay away from me , Bishop . You got that straight ? I guess she don 't like the corn bread either . - Squad , atten-ho ! Officer on deck ! - As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right , listen up ! Morning , Marines . I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you before we left Gateway ... - Sir ? - What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . - What 's the question ? - Is this gonna be a stand-up fight , sir , or another bug hunt ? All we know is there 's still no contact with the colony , and that a xenomorph may be involved . - Excuse me , sir . A what ? - A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . - What exactly are we dealing with here ? - Ripley ? I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . A crew member was brought back on board with something attached to his face , some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off , it wouldn 't come off . Later it seemed to come off by itself and die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner and , um ... It must have laid something inside his throat , some sort of embryo . He started , um ... he ... Look , man . I only need to know one thing : Where they are . - Go , Vasquez . Kick ass . - Anytime , anywhere , man . Somebody said " alien " . She thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up . - Fuck you , man . - Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Yeah . OK , right . Thank you , Ripley . We have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . If the colonists found that ship , there 's no telling how many of them have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so you 'd better look at it . Any questions ? - What is it , Private ? - How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth , and by the numbers . I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . Ordnance loading , weapons strip and dropship prep details will have seven hours . Now move it , people ! All right , sweethearts . You heard the man , you know the drill . Assholes and elbows ! Hudson , come here . Come here ! I don 't care if you are short , Hudson . Get it done ! - You 'll get lip cancer smokin ' those ! - Corporal , I want this loading lock sealed ! - How many more you got , Spunkmeyer ? - Last one . Take it away . Clear behind ! Did you check number three ? Is this the non-op ? Hi . I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here . Is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class 2 rating . Be my guest . Where you want it ? Bay 12 , please . All right . You 're a team , and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we 're gonna conquer , and we 're gonna kick some . Understood ? That 's what we 're gonna do , sweethearts . We are going to go and get some . All right , people . On the ready line . - Are you lean ? - Yeah ! - Are you mean ? - Yeah ! - What are you ? - Lean , mean marines ! Hudson ! Get on the ready line ! Get some today ! Get on the ready line ! Hurry up ! Move it out , goddammit ! Get hot ! One , two , three ! Come on , get out , get out , get out ! Move it out , move it out , move it out ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ! Absolutely badasses ! Let 's pack ' em in ! Get in there ! All right , people ! Move it ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ! All right , I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed ! Let 's go ! Come on , settle down , people ! - Lock ' em in , Hudson . - Ready to get it on ? You know it ! OK , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on . Yo ! Stand by . Cross-locking now . Pre-launch auto cycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by . 10 seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer . On my mark . Five ... We 're on an express elevator to hell ! Going down ! ... two , one , mark . Switch to DCS ranging . - 2-4-0 . Nominal to profile . - We 're in the pipe . Five by five . - We 're picking up some hull ionization . - Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? 38 . - Simulated . - How many combat drops ? Uh ... two . Including this one . - Shit ! - Oh , man . Range zero-one-four . Turning on final . - I got a bad feeling about this drop . - You always say that , Frost . - " I got a bad feeling about this drop . " - OK , OK . When we get back without ya , I 'll call your folks . All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody online . Lookin ' good . Drake , check your camera . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . I 'm ready , man . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . State-of-the-badass-art . You do not wanna fuck with me . Check it out . Hey , Ripley , don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam Phalanx . Wham ! Fry half a city with this puppy . We got tactical smart missiles , phased-plasma pulse rifles , RPGs , we got sonic electronic ballbreakers ! - We got nukes , we got knives , sharp sticks ... - Knock it off , Hudson ! Gear up . Two minutes , people . Get hot ! Somebody wake up Hicks . - Coming around for a seven-zero-niner . - Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . - That 's the atmosphere processor ? - Yup , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . You know , we manufacture those , by the way . OK , Ferro , take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . - All right . Hold at 40 . - Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . - They still have power . - OK , Ferro , set down on the landing grid . Immediate dustoff on my clear . Down and clear . Ten seconds , people ! Look sharp ! All right , I want a nice clean dispersal this time . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Head ' em up ! First squad up online . Hicks , get yours in a cordon . Watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move ! Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . Second squad online . Are you set ? Go on . Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . Sir , are you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . Uh , we got some explosives damage . It 's probably seismic survey charges . Are you readin ' this ? Keep it tight , people . All right , Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . OK , Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . It 's right in there . Now ! - Good one , Hudson . - Sir , we have a negative situation here . Wait . Wait , tell him to ... Hicks , back up . Pan right . There . You seeing ' this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you like that , you 're gonna love this . - Quit screwin ' around . - Second squad , what 's your status ? We 've just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , I think we missed it . The area 's secured . Let 's see what their computer can tell us . - It 's not secured . - The area is secured . First team , head for Operations . Hudson , try to get their CPU online . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . - He 's comin ' in . I feel safer already . - Pendejojerk-off . Sir , we got the CPU online . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . OK , let 's go . Are you all right ? Yes . Sir . They sealed off this wing at both ends . Welded the doors , and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . - Any bodies ? - No , sir . - Last stand . - Must have been a hell of a fight . Yeah . Looks that way . All right , Drake , this way . We should be able to cut through the medlab to Operations . Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones ? Careful , Burke . Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . Two are alive , the rest are dead . Surgically removed before embryo implantation . Subject : Marachuk , John J. Died during the procedure . They killed him taking it off . Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . - Behind us . - One of us ? Apone , where are your people ? Anybody in D-Block ? That 's a negative . We 're all in Operations . Talk to me , Frosty . Just keep movin ' , baby . - It 's moving . - Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . - Fuck ! - Hold up . Ripley ? Hey . It 's all right . It 's all right . Come on . - Just grab her , Corporal . - Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . It 's all right . It 's OK . Come on out . Come on . Easy , easy . I got her ! Ow ! Damn ! - Don 't let her go ! - She 's under the grille . - Frost , get your light up here . - Where 'd she go ? - Shine the light ! - Down here ! - Here ! Here ! - There she is ! Keep back ! Don 't scare her . - Grab her , man ! We 're gonna lose her . - Damn it ! Wait ! It 's OK . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . See ? Wait ! No , you don 't ! It 's OK . You 're gonna be all right now . Easy , easy . It 's gonna be OK . It 's all right . You 're gonna be OK . Easy ... easy . - What 's her name again ? - Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? - Now look , Rebecca , you have to try ... - Gorman . Give it a rest , why don 't you ? - Total brain lock . - Physically she 's OK . Borderline malnutrition , but no permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . That good , huh ? Uh-oh . I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one , too . You don 't talk much , do you ? - Smoking or non-smoking ? - Just tell me what you 're scanning for . PDTs . Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within 20 klicks we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . I don 't know how you managed to stay alive . But you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . Newt . - What 'd you say ? - Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt ? I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this ? Casey . Hello , Casey . - What about your brother ? What 's his name ? - Timmy . Is Timmy around here too , maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and dad ? Newt . Look at me . Where are they ? They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . - That 's a nice pet you got there , Bishop . - Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo ! Stop your grinnin ' and drop your linen . - Found ' em . - They alive ? Unknown . But it looks like all of ' em . Over at the processing station . Sub-level 3 , under the main cooling towers . - Looks like a goddamn town meeting . - Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . Let 's go , people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Let 's go . Head ' em out . OK , Frost , you 're drivin ' . It 's OK . Don 't worry . It 'll be OK . I want a straight V deployment . Second team on left flank . Advance on axial six-six-four . Tracker online . Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient . Hudson , tracker online . Left and right , little buddy . 40 meters in , bearing two-two-one , there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . You want sub-level 3 . Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . Check those corners . - Watch your spacing . - You heard him . Don 't bunch up . Stay loose . Your transmission 's showing a lot of break-up . - Probably interference from the structure . - Use those lights . Next one down . Then proceed on a two-one-six . Roger . That 's a two-one-six . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me , man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies in here . Easy . Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . Nice and easy . - Looks like some sort of secreted resin . - Yeah ... but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothin ' . Busy little creatures , huh ? - Hot as hell in here . - Yeah , man . But it 's a dry heat . Knock it off , Hudson . Lieutenant , what do those pulse rifles fire ? 10mm explosive-tip caseless . Standard light-armor-piercing round . Why ? Look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So , if they fire their weapons in there , won 't they rupture the cooling system ? - Yeah , she 's absolutely right . - So ? So what ? This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So you 're talking about a thermonuclear explosion and " Adiós , muchachos . " Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit ! Look , uh ... Apone ? Look ... We can 't have any firing in there . I want you to collect magazines from everybody . Is he fucking crazy ? What are we supposed to use ? Harsh language ? - Flame units only . I want rifles slung . - Sir , I ... Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . All right , sweethearts , you heard the man . Pull ' em out . Come on , let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn ! You too . Give it up , Ski . Come on . Let 's go . Crowe ! I want it now . Give it up . Right on , Vas . Let 's go , Marine . Give it up . Frost , you got the duty . Open that bag . - Thanks a lot , sarge . - Hicks , cover our ass . Head ' em out , people . I like to keep this handy ... for close encounters . I heard that . - Any movement ? - Nothing . Zip . Holy shit . Newt , go sit up front . Go on . Now ! Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it movin ' . Easy . Top ! Get over here ! We got a live one ! - You 're gonna be all right . - Please ... kill me . Just stay calm . We 're gonna get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . - Oh , man ! - What is it , Dietrich ? Convulsion ! Dietrich ! Get back ! Get back ! No ! - Flame-thrower ! - Kill it ! Get back ! Flame-thrower ! Move ! - Movement ! - What 's the position ? - I can 't lock in . - Talk to me , Hudson ! Multiple signals ! They 're closing ! Go to infrared , people . Look sharp ! - What 's happening ? We can 't see anything . - Pull your team out , Gorman . I got signals ! I got readings in front and behind ! - Where , man ? I don 't see shit ! - He 's right . There 's nothing back here . Look , I 'm tellin ' ya . There 's somethin ' moving , and it ain 't us ! Tracker 's off-scale , man . They 're all around us , man . Jesus ! Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . Frost ! Come on ! - Jesus Christ , Apone ! What is going on ? ! - Wierzbowski and Crowe are down ! Dietrich ! Crowe ! Sound off ! Frost ! Frost ! Wierzbowski ! Wierzbowski ! Let 's rock ! Who 's firing ? Goddammit ! I ordered a hold fire . They 're coming out of the walls ! They 're coming out of the goddamn walls ! Uh ... Apone , I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with ... Vasquez ! Drake ! Hold your fire , goddammit ! Apone , lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads ... Say again ? All after " incinerators " . I said lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back ... - Sarge ! Sarge ! - Apone ... - Talk to me . Apone ? - Top , you copy ? - Talk to me , Apone ! - He 's gone ! - Get them out of there ! Do it now ! - Shut up ! - Hicks , whoever 's left , get the hell out ... - Just shut up ! Where 's Apone ? ! Where 's Apone ? ! The sarge is gone ! Let 's get the fuck outta here ! Let 's go , Marines ! Hudson ? Vasquez ? - Hudson , look out ! - Get it ! - Hicks ! - Fall back ! - I told them to fall back . - Fall back ! Now ! - I told them to fall back . - They 're cut off ! - Do something ! - Let 's go , Marine ! - Come on , keep moving , baby ! - Hold on , Newt . Ripley , what the hell are you doing ? ! Turn it round ! That 's an order ! - Turn this thing around ! - Get off me , damn it ! You had your chance , Gorman . - Come on ! - Come on , Vas ! Come on , let 's move it ! Come on ! Let 's go , let 's go ! It 's blocked , man ! We 've got to go around . Open the door ! Hicks ! Drake ! We are leaving ! Get them , Vas ! Run for it ! Shit ! - Go ! Go ! - Drake , come on , man ! Come on ! Drake , come on ! No ! - Fire in the hold ! - He 's gone ! - No ! Drake 's out there ! - Come on ! Put it out ! - Drake 's coming ! - He 's gone ! No , he 's not ! Forget him ! He 's gone ! Get on the goddamn door ! Eat this ! Ripley ! Go , go , go ! It 's all right ! We 're clear ! Ripley ! You 've blown the transaxle ! You 're just grinding metal ! Come on , ease down ! Ease down . Ease down ! Ease down . You OK ? I 'm all right . Get away from me , man ! - Lieutenant . - What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know . Maybe a concussion . - But he 's alive . - No , man , he 's dead ! - Wake up , pendejo ! Then I 'm gonna kill you ! - Back off ... right now . Somebody get me a first-aid kit . Hey . Hey , look . The sarge and Dietrich aren 't dead , man . Their signs were low , but they ain 't dead . - Then we go back in there and get them . - Fuck that ! I ain 't going back in there . You can 't help them . You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . Oh , dear Lord Jesus , this ain 't happening ' , man . This can 't be happenin ' , man . This isn 't happening ' ! All right . We 've got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we roll them in there and nerve-gas the whole fuckin ' nest . It 's worth a try , but we don 't know if it 's gonna affect ' em . Let 's just bug out and call it even . What are we talking about this for ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . - Fuckin ' A ! - Hold on . Hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it . They can bill me . OK , look . This is an emotional moment for all of us , OK ? I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments , please . This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with , and I don 't think that you or I or anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them . - Wrong . - Yeah . Watch us . Maybe you haven 't been keeping up on current events . We just got our asses kicked ! Look , I 'm not blind to what 's going on , but I cannot authorize that kind of action . I 'm sorry . Well , I believe Corporal Hicks ... has authority here . Corporal Hicks is ? This operation is under military jurisdiction , and Hicks is next in chain of command , right ? Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Yeah . Look , Ripley , this is a multi-million-dollar installation . He can 't make that kind of decision . He 's just a grunt . - No offence . - None taken . - Ferro , do you copy ? - Standing by . Prep for dustoff . We need immediate evac . Roger . On our way . I say we take off , nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . Yo ! Pick it up , Hudson . Pick it up , baby . All right , we 'll set him down here . Move it , Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . - Hold on a second . There 's something ... - Just get up here ! I 'm in . Ramp closing . Spunkmeyer ? Goddammit . Well , where the f ? Run ! Well , that 's great ! That 's just fuckin ' great , man ! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now , man ! Are you finished ? Are you all right ? I guess we 're not gonna be leaving now , right ? - I 'm sorry , Newt . - You don 't have to be sorry . - It wasn 't your fault . - That 's it , man . Game over , man ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? What are we gonna do ? Maybe we could build a fire , sing a couple of songs , huh ? - Why don 't we try that ? - We 'd better get back . It 'll be dark soon , and they mostly come at night . Mostly . That 's everything , right ? All right , this is absolutely everything that we can salvage out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got 15 of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . - Is that the only flame-thrower ? - It 's only half-full . Got another one that 's damaged . But the good news ... We got four of these robot sentries , with display and scanners intact . They really kick ass . I think they 'll come in handy . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 17 days . 17 days ? ! Hey , man , I don 't wanna rain on your parade , but we 're not gonna last 17 hours . Those things are gonna come in here like they did before ... Hudson . Hudson ! This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . Right ? - Why don 't you put her in charge ? - You 'd better start dealing with it ! Listen to me . Hudson , just deal with it , because we need you , and I 'm sick of your bullshit . I want you to get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor-plan file . Construction blueprints , anything that shows the layout . Are you listening ? - Yeah . - I need to see air ducts , I need to see electrical access tunnels , sub-basements , every possible way into this complex . - We don 't have much time . - OK . - OK , I 'm on it . - Hudson ! Just relax . I 'll be in medlab . Check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . This service tunnel must be how they 're moving back and forth . That 's right . It leads from the processing station right into the sub-level here . Come down on that . OK , come over . Closer ... Go back . OK , punch that in right there . - No . It 's back here . - OK . There 's a pressure door at this end . Couldn 't we put one of the remote sentry units in the tunnel , then seal that door ? Yeah , but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . That 's right . So we repair the barricades at these two intersections , and weld plate steel over these ducts here , and here , and here . That way they can only come at us from these two quarters . Right . Then we put the other sentry units here and here . Right ? - Right . - Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . - All right , let 's move like we got a purpose . - Affirmative . Affirmative . Do your thing , baby . Come on , let 's get the hell outta here . Hudson here . A and B sentries are in place and keyed . Stand by . Arming now . - Test it , Hudson . - Do it ! Fire in the hole ! OK , let 's get the hell outta here ! We 're sealing the tunnel . Come on , baby . For what it 's worth ... Here , I want you to put this on . - What 's it for ? - It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . It 's just a precaution . - Thanks . - It doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . All right , what 's next ? Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now , you lie here and have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to sleep . I have scary dreams . I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . No . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her , hm ? Ripley , she doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry , Newt . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters , no real ones . - But there are . - Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Did one of those things grow inside her ? I don 't know , Newt . That 's the truth . Isn 't that how babies come ? I mean , people babies ? - They grow inside you . - No , that 's very different . - Did you ever have a baby ? - Yes , I did . I had a little girl . Where is she ? - She 's gone . - You mean dead . Here . Take this . For luck . How 's that ? - Don 't go ! Please ! - Newt , I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera right up there ? I can see you right through that camera all the time to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you , Newt . I mean that . - That 's a promise . - You promise ? - I cross my heart . - And hope to die . And hope to die . Now go to sleep . And don 't dream . Sneak ! The acid oxidizes after the creature 's death , completely neutralizing . That 's very interesting , but it doesn 't really get us anywhere . I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with here . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these . Which would mean that there would have to be a lot of these parasites . - One for each colonist . Over 100 at least . - Yes , that follows . But each of these things comes from an egg . So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . - Hey , maybe it 's like an ant hive . - Bees , man . Bees have hives . You know what I mean . There 's , like , one female that runs the whole show . - Yes . The queen . - Yeah , the mama . - She 's badass , man . I mean big . - These things ain 't ants , estúpido . I know that . I want these specimens destroyed when you 're finished . Mr. Burke wants them kept alive . He was very specific about it . Those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division . If you 're smart , we can both come out of this heroes , and we will be set up for life . You 're crazy , Burke , do you know that ? Do you really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past ICC quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it , Burke . From me . Just like they 'll know you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists . - Wait a second ... - You sent them to that ship . I just checked the colony log . Directive dated 6 / 12 / 79 , signed Burke , Carter J. You sent them out there and you didn 't even warn them . - Why didn 't you warn them , Burke ? - OK , look . What if that ship didn 't even exist ? I didn 't know . If I made a major security situation out of it , everybody steps in , administration steps in , and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . So I made a decision , and it was wrong . It was a bad call , Ripley . It was a bad call . Bad call ? These people are dead , Burke ! Don 't you have any idea what you 've done here ? I 'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall . You 're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . Ripley ... I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . - What is it ? What 's goin ' on ? - They 're coming . In the tunnel . Here we go . A and B gun tracking and firing . Multiple targets . Look at those ammo counters go . B gun 's down 50 per cent . Man , it 's a shooting gallery down there . 60 rounds left on B. 40 ... 20 ... 10 . B gun 's dry . 20 on A. 10 ... 5 ... - That 's it . - Jesus ! They 're wall-to-wall in there . They 're at the pressure door . - Man , listen to that . - Bishop here . - I 'm afraid I have some bad news . - That 's a switch . It 's very pretty , Bishop , but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . That 's beautiful , man . Oh , man . That beats it all . - How long till it blows ? - Four hours . With a blast radius of 30 kilometers , equal to about 40 megatons . - We got problems . - I don 't fuckin ' believe this ! - Vasquez , close the shutters . - Why can 't we shut it down from here ? I 'm sorry . The crash caused too much damage , and overload was inevitable . Oh , man ! And I was gettin ' short . Four more weeks and out . - Now I 'm gonna buy it on this rock ! - Hudson , give us a break ! Four more weeks . Oh , man ! We 've got to get the other dropship from the Sulaco . There must be some way of bringing it down on remote . How ? ! The transmitter was on the APC . It 's wasted . I don 't care how , but we 'd better think of something . Think of what ? ! We 're fucked ! We 're doomed ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? - The uplink tower down at the other end . - No , I checked . The hard wiring between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Somebody 's gonna have to go out there . Take a portable terminal , go out there , and patch in manually . Yeah , sure ! With those things runnin ' around ? You can count me out ! - I guess we can count you out of everything . - I 'll go . - Why don 't you go , man ? - I 'll go . - What ? - I 'll go . I 'm the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . Yeah , right , man . Bishop should go . Good idea ! Believe me , I 'd prefer not to . I may be synthetic , but I 'm not stupid . How long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly . 180 meters . - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there ... - Right . ... an hour to patch in and align the antenna , 30 minutes to prep the ship , and about 50 minutes flight time . It 's gonna be close . - Good luck . - See you soon . Watch your fingers . Vaya con Dios , man . This is unbelievable . 20 meters and closing . - 15 . - How many ? Can 't tell . Lots . D gun 's down 50 per cent . C gun 's right behind it . It ain 't stopping ' em . This thing ain 't stopping ' em . - 150 rounds on D. - Come on . Come on , baby ! - Come on ! - 100 rounds . Come on , come on ! D gun 's down to 20 . 10 . Damn it ! Wait ! They 're retreating . The guns stopped them . You 're right . - Next time they walk right up and knock . - Yeah , but they don 't know that . They 're probably looking for other ways to get in . - That 'll take ' em a while . - Maybe we got ' em demoralized . - Shut up ! - I want you two walking perimeter . Move ! Hey , listen . We 're all strung-out . But stay frosty , and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . Vámonos . How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? 24 hours ? Hicks , I 'm not gonna end up like those others . You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? If it comes to that ... I 'll do us both . Listen , let 's just make sure it doesn 't come to that . All right ? All right . Hey , I wanna introduce you to a personal friend of mine . This is an M41-A pulse rifle , 10mm , with an over-and-under 30mm pump-action grenade launcher . Feel the weight . OK . What do I do ? - OK . Pull it in tight here . - Right . Lean into it . Now , it will kick some . Right . When the counter reads zero here ... - I press this up ? - That 's right . And get another one in quick . Slap it in hard . - Right . - Now you 're ready to rock ' n ' roll . - What 's this ? - That 's the grenade launcher . - I don 't think you wanna mess with that . - You started this . Show me everything . I can handle myself . Yeah , I noticed . - How do you feel ? - All right , I guess . One hell of a hangover . - Look , Ripley , I just want ... - Forget it . Excuse me . It 's OK . It 's OK . Newt . - Wake up . - Wha ? Be quiet . We 're in trouble . Move , Newt ! Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Say again , Bishop . You 've got it into auto refuel mode , and it 's sequencing right ? - That 's right . - OK . Good . Stay on it . Get back to me when you 've activated the launch cycle . - He 's at the uplink tower . - Terrific . - Hicks ! Hicks ! Hicks ! - Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Help us ! Break the glass ! Break it ! Break it ! I 'll try . Ripley , I 'm scared . Me too . Stay here . - It 's the medlab . - Hudson ! Vasquez ! - Meet me in the medlab . We got a fire ! - We 're on our way . They 're coming , Newt . Shoot it out ! - Hudson ! - Jesus ! Christ , kid ! Look out ! - Over there ! Ready ? - Yeah ! - Hudson ? - Yeah , all clear . Nailed the other one . It 's history , man . Jesus ! Burke ... It was Burke . I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now ! It just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine if one of us was impregnated ... whatever you call it , and then frozen for the trip home . Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying . Me and Newt . - Wait a minute , now . We 'd all know . - Yes . The only way he could do it is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home . Namely yours . Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . Fuck ! He 's dead . You 're dogmeat , pal ! This is so ... nuts . I mean , listen ... listen to what you 're saying . It 's paranoid delusion . It 's really sad . - It 's pathetic . - Burke , I don 't know which species is worse . You don 't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage . All right , we waste him . No offence . No ! He 's gotta go back ! - They cut the power . - How could they cut it ? They 're animals ! I want you two with trackers , checking the corridors ! - Gorman , watch Burke ! Newt , stay close ! - I got him . - I 'll go this side . - You do that , man . - Anything ? - Somethin ' . - It 's inside the complex . - You 're just reading me . No , no . It ain 't you . They 're inside . Inside the perimeter . They 're in here . Hudson , stay cool . Vasquez ? Hudson may be right . - Get back , both of you ! - The signal 's weird . Must be some interference or somethin ' . There 's movement all over the place ! Get back to Operations ! - It 's game time . - Newt ? Seal the door . - Hurry ! - Come on , come on ! Come on , get back ! Work fast ! Cover your eyes , Newt . Don 't look at the light . Movement . Signal 's clean . Range 20 meters . They 've found a way in . Something we missed . We didn 't miss anything . 18 . - 17 meters . - Something under the floor , not in the plans . - 15 meters . - Ripley ! - Definitely inside the barricades . - Let 's go ! - 13 meters . - That 's right outside the door . Get back ! - Man , this is a big fucking signal . - How you doing , Vasquez ? Talk to me ! Almost there . That 's it ! 12 meters . 11 ... - 10 ... - Then they 're right on us . - Nine meters . - Remember , short controlled bursts . Eight meters . Seven . - Six . - Can 't be . That 's inside the room . - It 's readin ' right , man ! Look ! - Well , you 're not reading it right . Five meters , man . Four ... What the hell ? ! - Oh , my God . Oh , Jesus ! - Give me the light . There they go ! Over there ! Get ' em ! Come on ! Come on ! Do something , Gorman ! Look out ! Look out , there 's more of ' em ! Medical ! Get to Medical ! Do it ! - Now ! - Look out , Hudson ! Look out ! Now ! Burke ! Open this door ! Burke ! Open it ! Come on , let 's go ! Fall back ! Die , motherfucker ! Burke ! Hudson ! Hudson ! Motherfucker ! Come on ! Come on ! Come and get it , baby ! I 've got all day ! Come on ! Come on , you bastards ! Come on , you too ! You want some of this ? Fuck you ! Fuck you ! - Hicks ! Hicks ! - Hudson ! Come on , Hicks ! Go ! It 's locked ! Got it ! Let 's go ! - Let 's go ! - Go ! Go ! Move , Gorman ! Seal it ! Burke ! Goddamn you , open this door ! - Get back ! - Hurry up ! - Gorman , get out of the way ! - Ripley ! This way ! What ? - Wait . Get behind me . - Whatever you 're gonna do , do it fast ! - Hicks ! - Come on , let 's go ! Move ! - Which way to the landing field from here ? - This way . Go right ! This way ! This way . - Which way ? - Straight ahead and left . Bishop , do you read me ? Come in . Over . The ship is on its way . ETA 16 minutes . Good . Stand by there . We 're on our way . - Which way now ? - That way . No , wait . This way . You sure ? Vasquez ! Move ! - Right up here ! It 's just up here . - Hicks ! - We 're almost there ! - Newt ! Wait ! Newt ! Vasquez ! Go ! Oh , no ! - Newt ! - Up there . There 's a shortcut across the roof . Hicks ! You always were an asshole , Gorman . Newt ! - Ripley ! - Newt ! Hicks ! Hicks , get her ! Hurry ! - Hold on , Newt ! - I 'm slipping ! - Don 't let go ! - Ripley ! - Hold on ! - Help ! Got ya ! I got ya . Newt ! No ! Come on ! We can find her with this ! Stay where you are , Newt ! - Ripley ! - We 're coming ! Ripley ! This way . She 's close . Newt ! Ripley ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? - Newt ! - Here ! I 'm here ! Where ? Newt , are you OK ? - We need to cut it . - Climb down , honey . We 've gotta cut through . Newt ? Don 't move . Stay very still . OK . We 're almost there . Hang in there , OK ? - Hicks ! Hurry ! - I know . - I know ! - I mean it ! Newt ! Newt , just stay still ! - Almost there ! - No ! Newt ! No ! No ! - Let 's go ! - No ! They don 't kill you ! They don 't kill you , they ... - She 's alive ! She 's alive ! - All right ! I believe you ! She 's alive ! We 've gotta go ! Now ! - Hicks ! - Get it off ! Here ! Go ! Come on ! You can make it ! Bishop ! How much time ? - Plenty . 26 minutes . - We 're not leaving ! We 're not ? Ripley ? I don 't wanna hear it , Bishop . She 's alive . There 's still time . - Hicks , don 't let him leave . - We ain 't going anywhere . - See you , Hicks . - Dwayne . It 's Dwayne . Ellen . Don 't be gone long , Ellen . Attention . All personnel must evacuate . You now have 15 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have 14 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Ripley ! Ripley ! Grab on to me ! Hold on ! Let 's go ! Behind us ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have four minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Come on , goddammit ! Hold on to me ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance . No ! Bishop ! Goddamn you ! Close your eyes , baby . Look ! Come on ! Come on ! Punch it , Bishop ! It 's OK . We 're OK . We made it . I knew you 'd come . He 's gonna be all right . He 's just out . I had to give him another shot for the pain . We need a stretcher to carry him up to Medical . I 'm sorry if I scared you . That platform was just becoming too unstable . I had to hope things didn 't get too rough to take you off . Bishop ? - You did OK . - I did ? Oh , yeah . Go ! Move ! No ! Here ! Here ! Run ! Here ! Get away from her , you bitch ! Come on ! Come on ! Ripley ! Bishop ! - Mommy ! - Oh , God ! Not bad for a human . Are we gonna sleep all the way home ? - All the way home . - Can I dream ? Yes , honey . I think we both can . - Sleep tight . - Affirmative .

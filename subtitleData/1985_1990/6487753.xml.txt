Home of unscrupulous , unemployed , former junior assistant , Graham Sweetley . That 's the incredible story tonight . Earlier this evening , the head of special operations , on site , cmd . Grenville Matteson was prevailed upon to issue a statement . He said there are 3 extraterrestrials of humanoid , Caucasian appearance . The leader is male , about 31 , 6 ' 2 " , 190 pounds , pallid complexion , lank , greasy hair . The second is of indeterminate sex , 28 , 5 ' 10 " , 145 pounds , short , dark hair , pale skin . The female is 26 , looks younger . 26 ! She has a delicate complexion and excellent bone structure . Her eyes are hazel , flecked with gray and sometimes a little sad . Her voice is throaty , hands exquisite , and she 's said to have a certain indefinable something . Cmd . Matteson added they were highly intelligent and potentially dangerous . Highly intelligent ? Highly intelligent ? You 've got it wrong ! They 've got it wrong . Listen to me , woman . I shouldn 't be here ! I should be over there in , ah , in what 's it called ... England . Don 't you understand ? You can 't let those idiots talk to your civilization ! They 've enough trouble with each other . Bernard , I think we 'd be better off downstairs . [ excited chattering ] Look , I 'm quite calm . Is that the time ? I promised to give the eskimo chief a ping-pong lesson . You 're wasting your time with me . [ man ] Kill them before they kill us ! Aliens ! Can we not watch something else ? No ! Look ! That man 's going to throw something . What is it ? Ouch ! It 's some sort of brick , I think . That could 've been dangerous , that . I 'm hungry . Wasn 't our fault we crashed on their planet , was it , Sand ? No . It was Des ' fault ! [ groaning ] Aah ... Aah ! This is madness ! Madness . I can 't ... I can 't let them do this . I can 't . [ screaming ] [ Graham ] So ! Space travelers come halfway across the universe to this planet . This is how we greet them , is it ? [ woman ] Yeah , he 's right , he 's right . With rocks and with avocados . [ woman ] How much are avocados ? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves . These aren 't space monsters with TV aerials stuck on their heads . They haven 't come here to zap your planet with their ray guns . These are fellow beings , come in peace to do a bit of shopping . People of earth , people of earth . We should count ourselves privileged , yeah , yeah , privileged , to greet these intrepid pioneers who 've come so far across the spaceways . [ explosion ] Because they didn 't do that without courage ... [ man ] Fire ! Yes , and without fortitude and without wisdom . [ man ] They 've seen the light ! Uh ... Your cooker 's on fire . You stupid imbeciles ! [ crowd yelling ] You haven 't been on holiday with them . I tell you , they 're absolutely ... [ groaning ] [ screaming ] come on . Come on , that 's it .

So , uh ... Where y 'all from ? Originally ? Yup . Well , originally , I come from a long way away . Uh , you see , what happened was , I was with my friends . And we were , um , we were in our spaceship ... uh ... Ahh ! [ woman ] Here they come . Who 's this ? [ Flunkey ] Countess Gretal of the Netherlands , may I present Sandra Brock ? [ giggling ] You 've got all the gear on then , have you ? Have you seen this , Julian ? [ giggling ] [ Flunkey ] King Alexis of Moravia . Sandra , I have to talk to you . [ Julian ] Leave her alone . Forgive me . It was the only way . No . Look , Sandra doesn 't like you . All right ? There 's a quiet anteroom , somewhere where we can talk . Just the 2 of us . Who are you shoving , mate ? Get back in line . For goodness sake ! I don 't know what people see in her . She 's perfect ! [ Countess ] Perfect ? I 've got bigger tits than she has . Yes , I understand . I 'll be with you in a minute . There 's somebody on the other phone . Excuse me . Hold on for a moment . Hello , this is the aliens residence . Can you hold a minute please ? Aren 't you lot up yet ? We 're having a bit of relaxation . I 'm sorry about that . Yes , yes . Des ? [ Julian ] It says here , you 're a big pop star on blob . Does it ? " Sandra Brock said yesterday that ... " well , they exaggerate , don 't they ? Look , these are ambassadors from another planet . They 're not interested in advertising . No . " She went on to say that her husband , Des , " is a well-known millionaire scientist on their planet . " Some hope of that . [ Graham ] Honestly , they wouldn 't do it for $ 1 million . You 're offering $ 1 million ? No , you don 't - you don 't understand . There is nobody here who has the slightest interest or concern for mouthwash . No . No , non , niente , nein . No , not $ 9 million . No . You don 't understand . The money is entirely irrelevant . No , that doesn 't mean they 'll do it for free , either . No . Please , stop bothering me . I 'm going to put the phone down now , you see . Just go away ! [ Graham stammering ] Hello . Hello , I 'm sorry about that . Hey , that tastes just like loob ! Oh , my god ! For charity , yes . I 'm afraid you 're barking up the wrong tree here . They don 't even know what golf is . I don 't think it 'd be fair to ask them to do it . The answer is no . Yes . [ phone ringing ] Could you get that for me , Julian , please ? Doesn 't look like " loob . " It tastes like it , though . Up your flaps . Oh , don 't drink it , Des . It looks like wee . Thank you , very much . [ phone continues ringing ] " Loob 's " green , Desmond . Good luck with the tournament and ... and " up yours , " too . [ phone ringing ] Graham , get me a crate of this stuff , eh ? Yes , I 'll get it in just a minute . You haven 't got time to do that , Graham . You promised you 'd take us to Scatland ! Scotland , in fact . I can 't get any water out of this thing . You promised we could go and do some shopping in Scatland ! Post . You promised ! Oh , shut up ! What am I doing ? What am I doing ?

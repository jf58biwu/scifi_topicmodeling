 Look , that 's a bright one ! Whoa ! A fireball . Hey , look . There 's Mars . Where ? Right over there . See it ? It 's pretty close . It 's at the perihelion , only 30 million miles from Earth . Only 30 million ? Well , no wonder it looks so close . Smart ass . Smart ass . Hey , look . Here they come . More this year than last . This should be the heaviest shower this year . Holy shit ! Jesus , that 's bright . That one 's not gonna vaporize . It 's gonna make it through the atmosphere . It 's a hell of a tail , huh ? It 's time for bed . Mom , you missed it . It was incredible . Well , come on . It 's bedtime . But it 's just getting started . Yeah , but you have school tomorrow . Well , so do you . Yeah . That 's why we 're all going to bed , right ? Not me . Me , neither . Hey . Yeah . Oh , my God . What is this ? Doo doo , you 're dead , 50 lasers in your head . All right , and now it 's time to go to bed . How can I become an astronaut if I can 't stay up late ? Did you finish your homework ? Did you finish yours ? Good night . Required reading ? Hey , give me that . Look , don 't keep him up too late . Okay ? The base commander came to my school today . " Mad Dog " Wilson . What was he there for ? Public relations , I guess . You guess ? Hey , you hear that ? Hear what ? Thunder , dad . You must be getting pretty old . Wise guy , huh ? Oh hey , I almost forgot . A penny ... '58 D. Mint condition . Wow ! Thanks ! I 'll put it in your jacket . Get under the covers . Come on . Come on , come on . Love you . I love you , too . Good night . Sweet dreams . Good night , dad . Mom and dad ! Mom ! Dad ! Mom ! Dad ! Dad ! Quick , get up ! Get up ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! What ? Come on , you gotta come see . A UFO landed right behind the hill with all these red lights . Come on ! Come on ! Look at that lightning . Run ! And it was really bright . I 'm so glad you got him a telescope . It was huge and really bright , with all these strange lights . It landed right back there , behind the hill . I bet it was ball lightning . No , dad . I know what ball lightning is . It wasn 't that . It was something else . A UFO . It must have been . Could it have been something from the base ? No , it wasn 't a plane . I 've never seen anything like this before . Maybe it was a meteorite . No way , dad . You go back to bed right now . I 'll look when it 's light , ok ? Ok . Go back to bed . On the journal side , we have our receipts , little sales and invoices . Invoices . Okay , on our ledger we have accounts receivable , payments ... Hi , mom . Where 's dad ? Did you make your bed ? Huh , it 's made . What are you doing ? It 's not what you think . Don 't get caught . No , not me . George , why aren 't you dressed ? You want coffee ? Yeah . Uh , what happened to your other slipper , dad ? What ? I lost it . Oh , not your nice leather ones . It 's kind of muddy out there . What 's wrong with you , sweetheart ? Do you feel all right ? I 'll get you another pair when I 'm at the fed mart . Are you sure there wasn 't anything over the hill , dad ? Nothing . It was just a bad dream . That 's all . What happened to your neck ? Sit down , David . Eat it while it 's hot , you guys . I 'm going . Bye , darling . But , mom ... Oh look , eat that or you 'll be late . Let me walk you to the bus stop . You were right , son . There is something over the hill . What ? Come on . I 'll show you . No , dad . Hi , David . ... so have your parents sign them for the field trip , and return them to me first thing in the morning . You know this is frog week . I collected these fresh specimens this morning at the marsh area , at Copper Hill . Now , who can tell me what these two red sacs are ? Which ones , Mrs. McKeltch ? Will you show me on mine ? Yes . This is gonna be great . Oh , yeah . Ooh ! Sick ! Want it back ? David Gardner . This may be the way you behave at home . But he threw ... This is not the way you behave in my classroom . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Thank you . Look , he 's bleeding . Heather , you supervise while I take this uncontrollable young man to the school nurse . And I hope you need a tetanus shot . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Yeah . Miss Magnusson . David Gardner has gone ahead and cut himself . It probably serves him right . Oh , yes . Thank you . What ? I 'm sorry . I said this silly boy has cut himself . I don 't know what 's got into him . He 's uncontrollable . I 'll take it from here , Mrs. McKletch . McKeltch ! I think you 'll live . Later , David . Bye-Bye . See you tomorrow . Dad . David Gardner , feed me . Mom . God . Don 't ever do that . Where 's dad ? I don 't know . He 's probably around here somewhere . No . I looked all over . He probably got a ride to the base with some of the guys . No , I don 't think so . Something 's wrong . What 's the matter ? Dad 's weirded out . Oh , honey , you know your dad . Don 't worry . Now , I 'm worried . Hi , chief . Thank you for coming . Sure , Mrs. Gardner . Do you know officer Kenney ? Ma 'am . Well , George isn 't here . His car is here , but he 's not here . Uh , you have any idea where he might be ? Um , maybe he went back over the hill . No , David . Excuse me ? Copper Hill . He went up there this morning to take a look . David thought he saw a plane crash there . No , I didn 't . I saw a UFO . Huge lights , everything . David , stop it ! I 'm sorry . I tell you what , we 'll go up and have a look . Oh , thank you . It 's just back there . Let me show you . I didn 't hear nothing about a plane crash . Me either . I haven 't been up here since I was a kid . Oh , my God . George , you scared the hell out of me . This is Ed . Ed ... this is my wife . This is my son . How do you do ? Couldn 't do much better . And yourself ? Just fine . George , where were you ? We called the police . I guess I 'd better be going . I have to pick up Alice and Heather . See you later , Ed . What happened to you ? And where did that guy pop up from ? That 's Heather 's dad . She sits next to me in class . I think he 's weird , dad . Ed works for the phone company , the switching division . Since when do you work for the phone company ? We had a special meeting . The new hookup at the base . Well ... I 'm home now . I see you 're back . Your little lad 's got quite an imagination . Yes . I know . Thank you for coming , chief . Looks like we found him ourselves . Everything 's fine now . Thanks . Our pleasure . Good-Bye , ma 'am . Good-Bye . You know ... Mom . It certainly is beautiful up there over the hill . We 'll take a walk after you do the dishes . After I do the dishes ? George , you 're acting very strange . Mom ! Not hungry , David ? You feel all right ? I don 't think he 's feeling well . I have an idea . Why don 't we all go on a picnic up at the hill ? Mom , you 've got classes . We 'll go this afternoon . It 's wonderful up there . Your father showed me a place you 've never seen before . Is this a joke ? We 'll have a wonderful time . I 'll pack us a lunch , hamburgers . You like that , don 't you ? I don 't want to go . Hey , little fellow , give your mom a hug . Later . Help me , help me , help me . You were shitting me about that spaceship crap , right ? Just forget it . All the guys think you 're really spaced . That 's just great . Sure you don 't want to play ? No . Okay . We go tonight . There must be no mistakes , or we 'll be destroyed at 12 : 00 midnight . No problem . George Gardner has been delegated . What are you doing , David ? Heather ! David Gardner . Stop ! Stop right where you are ! Linda ! Linda ! Miss Magnusson ! David , what 's wrong ? I 've had it with you ! Mrs. McKeltch , what is the problem ? I told you this boy was trouble . He needs to be severely punished . David , what 's the matter ? He knocked over a defenseless little girl , and he 's a little snoop . Please Mrs. McKeltch , why don 't we just talk with each other ? Give him to me . Please let me talk to him . David , go inside my office . You 're pushing it , sister . I 'll be back for him in 5 minutes . 5 minutes . Give me that ! It 's okay , David . Just relax . Relax ! You don 't understand . What ? What don 't I understand ? You know David , that whatever you tell me stays in this room . I 'm a nurse . I 'm here to help . I mean , I 'm supposed to say that , but ... it really is true , David . Okay , first , can I see the back of your neck ? Okay . Eating a frog ? I don 't know , David . That 's some kind of story . It 's not a story . A UFO lands in the back of your house and puts something in your mom and dad 's neck . Then it gets your teacher and the police and your friend Heather and her father , Ed . From the telephone company ? How did it get Mrs. McKeltch ? She said the frogs came from around Copper Hill . She must have been there . Stay right there a minute . Well ? Mrs. McKeltch , David seems concerned about an injury to your ... to your neck . My neck ? Yes , he says that you 're wearing a bandage . Why , yes . I have a boil on my neck . A boil ? A boil . I could help you clear that up if you 'd let me look at it . Don 't touch me ! I want the boy . If you don 't give him to me ... you have a lot of nerve , sister . Oh , boy . This is going to be a mess . Okay . Go out the window . Now , this is the key to my back door . You wait for me , and I 'll come and see you when classes let out . Where do you live ? 462 South Royal . Okay . Bye . Where 's David ? He 's not feeling well , Heather . Why don 't you come back later ? He 's still with the nurse . His parents will take him . He 's not well . He may be in danger . We 'll sue . What kind of nurse are you , anyway ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Gardner . I just left the office for one moment . When I got back , he was gone . What did he talk to you about ? He was upset . He 's having a problem with one of the teachers . I told you . He needs psychiatric help . Is that all he said ? Yes . It was only a small problem with one of the teachers . A , e , i , o , u . You get me a pile . Then you get me whittles . You bring them both to me or I 'll have your heart and liver out , David Gardner ! David Gardner ! I 'll get you . I 'll get you . David Gardner . I 'll get you . I found them ! Keep it down . They 'll see us ! I was down there ! I found Mrs. McKeltch . Calm down . We 're in big , big trouble ! I saw them . They 're bigger than anything I 've ever seen ! They probably think I 've kidnapped you ! No ! They tried to catch me . They chased me through their tunnels . They almost killed me . What ? Who ? These things . They 're huge , ugly , slimy , giant Mr. Potato heads ! Hold it . I don 't understand what you 're saying . Come on . I 'll show you . David ! You 're not just a crazy child , are you ? This is where the tunnel opening was . I don 't see anything . It 's gone ! But I 'm positive it was here . I 'm positive ! I swear it ! But it 's not , David . They moved it . They can move tunnels ! David , it 's just too crazy for me . But you saw the band-Aids on the back of their necks . Yes , but they 're just band-Aids . Okay , we have to go to the hill . We do ? Does it look to you like anything 's landed there ? David , we 're already in trouble , both of us because of my helping you run away . Now , I can make up a story that 'll smooth things over . Your house is right down there . Look ! Unload the magnotometer . Coming up . Can you tell us where this is , Mr. Gardner ? Straight up the hill and over into the canyon . Johnson , you got everything ? All set . Right over here , man . Yeah . Over the hill , he said . Anything ? Not yet . Does Gardner seem a little weird to you ? What 's his story ? I don 't know . Down here . Come on . You got anything ? Not yet . Real strong reading here . Yeah , I 'm following you . I 'm picking it up , too . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm picking it up . What ? Found something . Oh , no ! No , no ! No ! Oh , my God ! Let 's get out of here ! Oh , no ! The field trip ! Mrs. McKeltch took the whole class to the sandpit ! What are we going to do now ? I 'm going to make a call . Who are you calling ? The state police . You missed the field trip , David Gardner ! Linda ! Stop ! Come back ! I 'll get you for this , David Gardner ! Damn ! My God , what did she do to you ? Is your neck all right ? Yes , it 's fine . Did you get the state police ? No , their lines were busy . Are you all right ? Yes . David , there is one place we can hide while we call the FBI . David ! I 'm coming , I 'm coming . The phone 's dead . It 's Heather 's dad . He must be messing with the lines . Damn . Get down . Let 's get out of here . Where do we go ? Come on . I know a place . You check in there . In here . David ! Come on , this way . What in God 's name am I doing here ? But you saw those two guys ... I don 't know what I saw anymore , David . I 'm sorry . I don 't know . It 's okay to be afraid . I 'm not afraid . I 'm petrified . Me , too . Please , please . You hear something ? It 's okay . We 're the police . We 're here to help . They must be tunneling under the whole town ! I know they are ! We 've got to stop them . How ? They 're everywhere ! Let 's just get out of this crazy place ! No . We have to find my mom and dad . Well , we 're not going back alone . We need help . General Wilson . Who ? General Wilson ! All right , slow down . Where 's your pass ? We have to see General Wilson . It 's an emergency . Base commander 's office . Sgt. Major Rinaldi speaking . Yes , sir , he 's here . Who ? General . Provost marshal 's on the phone , sir . Yes . Sounds like another crazy . What ? George Gardner 's son ? Those are the two guys that got sucked under the sand . Oh , my . I don 't like the look of this . Okay , miss Magnusson , David . Now , what 's this all about ? David , has this got anything to do with your father ? I don 't mean to be rude , but I haven 't got much time . What happened was ... No ! Let me see the back of your neck first . The back of my neck ? Yes . Please , general . He 's serious . I had to make sure first . I guess I 'm next . Okay , go on . It 's wired . The detonator is set . You better hurry , Or you just might blow it . I understand how it must sound , general but I can assure you it 's absolutely true . I don 't know . People being sucked under the sand . A lot of aliens running around loose underneath the town . It 's a little hard to swallow . Excuse me , sir . NASA does confirm a visual sighting . A UFO , two nights ago during the meteor shower . But radar reported no strike . In fact , radar reported nothing at all . General , what if the ship absorbed energy ? It wouldn 't show up on radar because no energy would bounce back , right ? Sir , search teams were sent out to find signs of impact or landing . The men who checked the Copper Hill area gave it a clean report . That 's because they were sucked under the sand ! They 're all part of it ! Walker , would you please come in here ? Ma 'am , I 'd like you and the boy to leave us for a moment . Yes , sir . Sir ? Walker , I want you to escort these two people to the briefing room . Yes , sir . Please , follow me . Rinaldi , I want you to notify NASA that we 're going to do just a routine security check on their men . Don 't want to make an issue out of this . Yes , sir . The general 's ready to see you now . Sorry to disturb you boys . Just have a couple of routine questions about the Copper Hill search . Place these men under arrest ! Tell me what the hell is going on ! General ... Keep back ! My God . What ? They 're dead . Jesus ! Stay clear ! Don 't touch those things ! Seal the base perimeter . Alert security ! Get those NASA hotshots back over here right away . Maybe they can explain this . Bring the nurse and the kid back , right now ! Lock off the launch area . Yes , sir . David , this is Dr. Stout , senior scientist on the millennium project . This is Dr. Weinstein . How do you do , David ? We work with your father . Hi , David . Your dad 's talked about you a lot . This is Linda Magnusson , David 's friend . Doctor , I didn 't think the Viking missions found any sign of life . Except for this photo I saw in a magazine of these things on the surface that looked like pyramids . I saw that photograph . And what about that huge thing that kind of looked like a monkey 's head ? It was in all the papers . That was fake , right ? On the contrary , there were other photos too sensational to be made public . But there 's not enough water to support life . On the surface . We 're looking below ground . If there is , David , it may not want to be found . The tunnels ! It may not want us up there . There really is no other choice . No please , General Wilson , any further delay , we 'll miss the launch window . Mars won 't wait for us , general . I understand , gentlemen . We will go tonight , but we must be able to guarantee security . We still don 't know what the hell we 're dealing with . What would you suggest that we do ? I want to put a temp freeze on countdown until we 're all clear . Then it 's your show . You got yourself a deal . No , it 's a temp freeze . Well , tell Mission Control I 'm authorizing it . I know , I 'll be right down . Good , doctor . General , we 're going down to control . We 'll be back soon . General , listen ! We have a break in security , sir ! There 's an I-O-X truck on the runway , sir . General , base security arrested two technicians trying to steal equipment . Steal what ? Copper wire , sir . A lot of it was loaded onto a base truck . Copper wire ? Sir , operations report space radar back in service . Anything coming in ? Negative , sir . They 're already here , gentlemen . David , can you take me to the sandpit ? Yeah , it 's right behind my house . Is alert force standing by ? Ready when you are , sir ! Captain Curtis , take a platoon and get down to the school . Don 't worry , boy . We are not out of options yet . Marines have no qualms about killing Martians ! Go , go , go , go ! Go ! Move it ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move it , move it , move it ! Go , go , go ! Go , go ! Secure the house ! Fire teams 1 and 2 ! Check your field of action ! Platoon leaders , check your field of fire ! Cellars , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Hope you know what we 're doing . Yes , I do . My God . Let 's go ! Sir , that civilian house is all clear . General Wilson ! Yes , David ! I have an idea . If we just try to talk to them ... Sir , we just received confirmation of a telesystem beneath the school . Captain Curtis has entered and headed due west with no resistance . Due west ! That 's towards us ! Sir , the demo charges are in . You want to show us where you want the winches ? Let 's take a look ! David ! David ! Please stay put . Sgt. Lance . Sir ! See that those marines are secure ! Yes , sir ! All right , move it ! Let 's go ! First sector of fire is 11 : 00 , 2 : 00 . Go ! Check out 11 : 00 . He 's going to fall ! Rinaldi ! Stay the hell away from there ! Oh , Rinaldi ! Rinaldi ! Ready those winches ! Hit the deck ! Hold your fire ! Get down , damn it ! We can 't just blow away an opportunity like this . Look at these creatures . We don 't know much about them , or why they 're here . It 's all right , boys . It 's ... It 's all right . How 's he know they 're boys ? Shut up ! I think I have something that belongs to you . This is yours , right ? This is yours . That 's right . I 'm Mark Weinstein , Uh ... Dr. Weinstein . I 'm from Seti , S-E-T-I . The search for extraterrestrial intelligence , and ... You do understand me ... don 't you ? You do . They do understand me . You see ? They do understand me . Fire ! All right . Let 's recon these tunnels . David , it 'll be all right . David , what 's wrong ? No , David ! David ! I got to find my mom and dad ! No ! David , stop ! David ! David , come back here ! Oh , no ! David ! Dad ! Just come back here ! I have to find my mom and dad ... Linda , stop ! No ! David ! All right ! Let 's go in ! Set the charges ! Let 's do it ! But , general , the woman and the child ! We 'll just have to risk it . There 's no other way . Move it in ! Hustle , hustle , hustle ! Get up ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Hurry up and get out of there ! Get the hell out of there ! Get the hell out of ... Start the winches ! Come on , men , you can get up ! Pull , pull , pull ! Come on ! You can do it ! Come on ! Get out ! This way ! Keep it up ! Let 's go ! We got to go down there ! Recon ! Get ready ! Go ! Linda . Linda ! Don 't let him get away . Check inside now . Man , this stuff sure stinks . Yeah , it smells like sulfur dioxide . Keep moving . What the hell you doing , man ? It 's cupric oxide . There 's no time for that . Let 's move ! They 're smelting copper . Come on ! Move ! Be careful . Come . Where 's Linda ? Linda 's very busy right now . Let her go ! You 're a lucky boy , David Gardner . Not everybody gets to meet the supreme Martial intelligence . Can I ... Can I talk to you ? Please , don 't hurt Linda . And if you could give me my mom ... You 've been quite a bit of trouble already , David Gardner . They didn 't do any harm to you . My mom , dad , Linda , all the others . They 're good people . They would never hurt you ... It 's too late . Shut up ! I 'm talking to him ! Please . It 's too late . I 'll stay after school every day for the rest of my life if you would just shut up ! Don 't you understand ? You can 't do this to people . You can 't control them . It 's wrong ! You 're not gonna get away with it ... 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Please . Can 't you give me my mom and dad back ? And Linda and Heather . I 'll leave Mrs. McKeltch . It 's your turn now , David Gardner . No way . Poor little guy . I 'll fix you ! You dick brain ! You bad boy ! All right ! Linda ! Linda ! Go back ! Rinaldi ! Stop . General . Oh , Christ , no . No , Rinaldi . No ! General , stay back ! Don 't do it , Rinaldi ! Shoot me . Fire ! Captain Curtis ! Look out ! Captain Curtis , General Wilson , up here ! David , are you okay ? They 've got Linda ! There 's this huge machine they use to get everybody . If we don 't get there fast , they 'll get her . It 's all right , David . Just stay calm , boy . Skipper , muster your troops . We 've got to get to the ship to save her ! Lock and load . I wasn 't trained for this . Linda 's over there ! Charge them ! Dragon ! Dragon ! Get over , set ! David , get over here ! Stay by me , boy ! Stay by me ! Are you ready to fire ? Dragon , fire ! Fire on the back flank area ! Captain ! Linda ! Men , get the rest of those charges in . Let 's go , guys , move it ! Stop , stop ! David , stop ! Linda , are you okay ? David ! Where are we ? The entrance ! The spaceship 's leaving ! David 's okay . But we 've got to get out of here right away ! Take her into the tunnels . We 'll meet you there ! Move it ! Come on ! The charges are in , sir . Just give me a time . I want 5 minutes to get out of here . Skipper , you got 5 minutes To get everyone out . Come on , boy ! Move ! Keep moving , Linda ! Move out ! Out ! Charge out ! David , get up ! We got to move out ! Move out ! Come on ! Beat it ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Keep moving ! Bastards ! They 've sealed off the entrance . Start digging ! We can 't dig our way out of here . We can 't even blow our way out ! Captain Curtis ! Yeah . General Wilson ! We have one of their weapons . I know it sounds crazy , but ... That just might do the trick , If we can just make it work in time . General Wilson . Fuel . It needs some copper . Copper is what they use . I saw them load it . Maybe a penny will do it . Damn , and I had a whole bagful . Hasn 't anybody got a penny ? You don 't carry change into combat , sir . Sir , a minute and 15 seconds . Dad 's ! '58 D , mint condition . You aim . I 'll fire . Help her , Curtis ! Help her ! Keep moving , men . David ! David , this way ! David ! I 'm coming ! Keep moving , men . Keep moving . David ! Over here . Mom ? Dad ? Come with us . Hurry , dear . They 'll leave without us . No , no . Please . Hey , little guy . You don 't know what you 're missing . Oh , yes , I do . Come on , little guy . Mom , dad , I love you . Please understand , I can 't come with you . David ! David . David ! Keep moving . Where 's David ? David ! Come on ! David ! Run ! Come on , David ! No ! Move it ! Move it for Christ 's sake ! No ! David ! Come on ! Move it ! Linda , come on ! David ! He 'll be all right . Get down there ! Hang on ! Come on , Linda , you can make it ! No ! David ! Come on , David ! David ! Hurry ! David ! Hurry ! Mom ! Mom ! Dad ! Help ! Dad ! David , what is it ? No , no ! Leave me alone ! David , it 's all right . It 's okay . You 're awake now . Honey ! Hey , it 's okay . Oh , David . They chased me , and then they got you and dad . Oh , they did ? Oh , calm down , honey . Calm down . Now , who chased you ? Dad , let me see the back of your neck . It must have been some dream . Please , let me see . Is it okay ? It 's okay . What about me ? You 're fine , mom . Oh , darling . You see , the spaceship landed right in back of the hill . What did ? And you started chasing me down the hill . Then everything exploded into a great big white light . That is really weird , David . Actually , I like the stuff about the Martians coming to steal the copper . But it seemed so real . Copper for energy , huh ? Well , David . You got nothing to worry about . Your penny collection is still here . You know what it seems to me ? It seems to me like your dream was full of all sorts of things that happened to you today . Like your penny collection . Even " Mad Dog " Wilson coming to your school . But I was so scared . There 's nothing to be afraid of , David Gardner . Mom ! Tomorrow , we 'll take a picnic up at the hill . Feel better now , big guy ? Yeah . Okay . You better get some sleep . You 'll be tired at school tomorrow . Good night , son . Good night , dad . Good night , sweetheart . Uh ... mom ? Do you want me to leave this open ? No , that 's okay . Good night . Mom ! Dad ! No !

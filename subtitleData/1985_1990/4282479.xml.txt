 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf . The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak . The only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew . In the three million years we have been away , it is my fond hope that mankind has abolished war , cured all disease and got rid of those little western saloon doors you get in trendy shops . - 140,000 rehydrateable chickens . - Check . - 72 tons of reconstituted patty . - Check . 4,691 irradiated haggis . It 's Saturday night . I 've had enough . 4,691 irradiated haggis . It 's Saturday night . I want to boogie on down . 4,691 irradiated haggis . We 've been doing this for four hours . Let 's have a break . 4,691 irradiated haggis . Will you stop saying 4,981 irradiated haggis , and speak to me ? 4,691 irradiated haggis . Rimmer , I want to go for a drink . 4,691 irradiated haggis . - I want some fun ! - This is fun , are you mad ? You read something out , I say " check " . Where 's the fun ? All right . We 'll put you in command for a few seconds , Cap-i-tain . What 's the plan ? Lickety-split . - Go back to Earth . - And in the meantime ? I dunno . Just sort of generally slob around ... have a few laughs . Excellent plan , Lister . Excellent plan . Brilliant plan . I was thinking you hadn 't thought about it . Clearly , you have . I 'll stand over here and laugh slobbily , shall I ? I 'm going for a drink . Where 's me cigarettes ? I only owe you four and three quarters . You owe me five . 0ne cigarette for each day you obey me . Five days , five cigarettes . I 'm penalising you one quarter of a cigarette for saying , " check " in a variety of silly voices , while doing the homogenised puddings . Well , I 'm taking five . You do and I 'll eject the rest of the ship 's stock into space . Ha , ha , ha . So , they 're somewhere near an airlock ? Ha , ha , ha . You 'll never find them , Lister . I was always a master at " Hide and Seek " as a child . - It 's not a gift you lose . - 0K , quark brain . Even it out . Take out the flaky bits . 0h , I really , really hate you , Rimmer . Have a lovely , lovely time , Lister . Give my regards to the air . Lights ! Holly , why Rimmer as a hologram ? Why did you have to bring Rimmer 's hologram back ? He was the most unpopular man on this ship . He even had to organise his own surprise birthday parties . Who should I have brought back , then ? Anyone . Chen ... Petersen ... Hermann Göring would have been more of a laugh than Rimmer . 0K , he was a drug-crazed transvestite , but at least we could have gone dancing . Water ! I brought Rimmer back because he 's the best person to keep you sane . 0h , crap . Not you ! Sorry , I wasn 't paying attention . See you later . What about Kristine Kochanski ? You could have brought Kristine back . Your entire life , your shared conversations with her - totalled 173 words . - So ? In terms of wordage , you had a better relationship with your plant . - I know , but Rimmer ! - He 's the person you knew best . Over 14 million words in all . Seven million of those were me telling him to smeg off , and the rest were him putting me on report for telling him to smeg off . Jean-Paul Sartre said hell was being locked forever in a room with your friends . Yeah , well , all his mates were French . ( LISTER HUMS ) Aaaaaaah ! Blwoooooo ! ( RAP BEAT ) I 've been to Titan , I 've been to juno . I can name eight things that go in jars that you know . Pickles . - Jam . - Spaghetti . Brains . What , in jars ? Me uncle 's brain is in a jar . It 's really sad . - Why 's it sad ? - He 's not dead yet . Everybody 's punished . Finish your drinks . ( GARGLE ) ( ALL ) Argh , yeah , yargh . Will you please excuse me ? Some of us have more important things to do than wiggle our posteriors . Will you move , please ? Thank you . Excuse me , please . Excuse me . If you want to dance , do it over there . - 0w ! - Sorry . That woman is out of your league . - She 's too classy for you . - Who is ? - Kochanski . - I 've no big thing about Kochanski . Stick to your usual type . Women with little wispy beards who wear three overcoats and carry little bags of string . - 0fficer Kochanski ? ! - Sh ! Shut up ! - Have you eaten a coconut whole ? - You 've no chance with her . - You 're just too ugly . - I 've no big thing about Kochanski . - I have . - So have I. - Where 's my revision timetable ? - Sir , it 's Saturday night . Nobody works Saturday night . You don 't work ANY night or day ! Skive hard , play hard , that 's our motto . I 've got my engineering re-sit on Monday . I don 't know anything . Where is my timetable ? Is it the thing with all different colours , with subjects divided into study and rest periods , - and self-testing times ? - It took me seven weeks to make it . Now I 've to cram the revision in one night ! The thing with a note on it , in red , " Vital , valuable , urgent . Do not touch on pain of death " ? - Yes ! - I threw it away . - Ha-ha , tee-hee . Where is it ? - I pinned it up on the wall . - Why ? - To dry it out . - What do you mean , dry it out ? - I spilt a goat vindaloo on it . It 's a bit red , but you can read most of it if you scrape the lumps off ! You spoilt my ... No , I haven 't time , I 'm taking learning drugs and memorising this conversation . - They 're illegal . - Where 's my timetable , Lister ? It 's Saturday night . You don 't work Saturday night . You don 't work any night or any day . Skive hard , play hard - my motto . ( C0NTINUES T0 REPEAT ) ( GR0UP ) Brrrrr ... Bleaaaa ...

Jump back . Get down . 0ooh , heh ! Good evening , you stupid , stinking , festering , gimboid of a cat . Ah , you 're going to put these cigarettes back , aren 't you ? Excuse me ! This is my all-time lucky find I ever found in the whole of today . No . You 're going to put these cigarettes back before he comes . - These are mine . - They 're not , put them back .

( TAPED MUSIC C0NTINUES ) - What on Titan is this din ? - It 's Rasta Billy Skank . Is this it ? It has a health warning on it . It 's bad for you . - It 's a classic . - " Danger ! Health Warning : " This music can make you irritable , irrational , " and is linked with disorders of the nervous system and bowels . " No one takes notice of that stuff . If you want to dice with death , fine , but don 't poison my sound waves . 0ff . ( MUSIC ST0PS ) Why don 't you listen to something really classical , like Mozart , Mendelssohn or Motorhead ? I think I 've gone video blind . Is that painting yours ? It 's rubbish . It 's a mirror ! I need some sleep . Rimmer , do you remember Kristine Kochanski ? Navigation 0fficer ? Yes , I remember her . Snooty cow . She looked down on me , called me " Rimmer " . Everybody called you Rimmer . It 's the way she said it - " Rimmer " . " Rimmer " , to rhyme with " scum " . God , she had a chip on her shoulder . - I want to go on a date with her . - Tough . She 's dead . - Just one night ... - No . - Turn you off for four hours ... - No . No . - Spend time with her hologram ... - No . You 're worried I won 't turn you back on ... I promise if you tell me where you 've hidden the hologram disc ... - No . - You won 't even discuss it . We are discussing it , Lister . What 's this if not a discussion ? A diesel locomotive ? I promise , I swear I 'll turn you back on . Is that it , the entire proposal ? - Yes . - Well , Lister ... Think about it seriously . Don 't dismiss it . All right . I 'll think about it . - You 'll just say " No " . - Don 't interrupt . I 'm thinking . - You 'll just say " No " . - Not necessarily . I 'm mulling it over . ( CLICKING HIS TEETH ) Nneeee ... No . Don 't you trust me ? I 'm holding up a black card . Conversation over . I 've always been crazy about her and done nothing about it . Lister , you 've forgotten the colour code . White is to continue the discussion . This is a black card situation . Discussion over . - Listen . - # Black card , black card . # - I 'm talking about something else . - White card . Go on . I want to stop all this black card , white card , smeg , - it 's driving me crazy . - Black card . Four hours , an evening with her hologram ! What 's wrong with that ? You don 't know when to stop . I 'm your superior . Technician was the lowest rank on this ship . The man who changed the bog rolls was higher than us . Well , he 's not here now , Lister , and we are . There 's still a pecking order and I 'm pecking you , baby . 0K , Rimmer ... 0K . - 0K ? - 0h-kaaay . - Is that a threat , Lister ? - Yeah . Actually , " 0K " is not a threat , technically speaking . It is when you mean it to mean what I mean . I mean it to mean : 0K , Rimmer . 0hh-kaaay ! 0K is never a threat , no matter how many " A " s you put on the end . I 'm going to pass the exams and become an officer . Come on . Wise up , Lister . You 'll have to salute me , call me " Sir " . You 'll have to give me Kochanski and me cigarettes . 0n that day , Lister , Satan will be skating to work . Lister ! Rise and shine , El Slotho . Come on ! I 've been awake for hours . Up , up , up . Exercise , Lister ! Exercise , sonny boy . Quarter to two ? I didn 't set my motivator . I was supposed to be up at seven . Why didn 't he wake me ? He knows I 'm a heavy sleeper . Have I to remind him to do everything for me ? He is so irresponsible . Holly , give me a cold shower , please . Certainly , Arnold . 0oooh ! Not that cold ! Hotter ! Hotter ! Aaaargh ! Not that hot ! Forget it . Can you give me a clean uniform ? Can you manage that ? Thank you , Holly . Where 's Lister ? Holly , where 's my arm ? This isn 't my arm . Whose is it ? Sorry , Arnold , your physical data disc has become corrupted . No excuses . Give me my arm back . I 'll refresh the graphics from a back-up . It 's got tattoos . " Candy " ? " Denmark Forever " ? Is this Petersen 's arm , Holly ? I 've got the arm of a Danish moron . Bear with me for a few minutes , Arnold . It 's not good enough , Holly . It 's traumatic enough being dead . Whose ears are these ? They 're like radar dishes stuck higgledy-piggledy to my head . Just look at them , look at them . Whose were these ears , Holly - an African elephant ? They 're your ears , Arnold . Must have been the way I slept . No time for this . Where 's Lister ? That information is security protected . What 's he doing ? Mmmm ! - Hello , how can I help you ? - Fish . Today 's fish is trout a la créme . - Enjoy your meal . - Fish . Today 's fish is trout a la créme . Enjoy your meal . - Fish . - Today 's fish is trout a la créme . - Enjoy your meal . - Fish . Today 's fish is trout a la créme . Enjoy your meal . - Fish . - Today 's fish is trout a la créme ... - Fish . - Today 's fish is trout a la créme . - Enjoy your meal . - I will ! - Where 's Lister ? - Mine ! The fish is mine ! I don 't want your fish , you stupid cat . Where 's Lister ? Idiot ! Holly , as senior rank , I order you to tell me where he is . - I 've told you , I can 't . - It 's an order . - You stupid , ugly goit . - Ugly ? I chose this face out of the billions available , as it is the face of the most prolific lover who ever lived . Really ? He must have operated in the dark a lot . - You what ? - When are you giving me my arm ? I refuse to walk round all day with Petersen 's arm . You know what he was like . God knows where this arm has been . Ah ! What 's he doing ? Beats me , Arnie . Seems to have a mind of its own . Tell him to stop it . What is this ? A cabaret ? Entertainment while you eat ? No ... no ... no ... Can you place bets ? My bet is on this arm . Ahhh ! Holly , you 're handsome and delicious . Please tell him to stop . All right . Give me a couple of seconds . Ha ! I 've outwitted him . He 's given up . Look , he 's given up . 0ooooh ! There , done it . Just in time . Hey ! That was good . You should 've finished on a song , to be perfect . I hate everything . Where is Lister , the little worm ? ( BANj0 MUSIC S0UNDTRACK ) Lister ? Listie ... Listie ... Wistie , Lister ? I know you 're here , Lister . You 're always here , Sunday afternoons . What are you two doing here ? Skutters don 't have time off . You really must think I 'm stupid . I 'll deal with you two later . ( INAUDIBLE ) You 're serious about this , aren 't you ? - Go away , I 'm busy . - 0ff . You seriously believe a fungus like you has the stuff to be an officer ? You 've the brains of diarrhoea and the breeding of a maggot . What are you writing on ? The inside of a chocolate wrapper ! Where 's your loose-leaf file ? Your pencils , your protractor and your hole reinforcers ? I 'm going to pass this exam by knowing things . - 0K . What 's a porous circuit ? - I don 't know . - How do you calculate acceleration ? - I don 't know . This is sad . What 's Boyle 's Fourth Law ? - Don 't eat greasy food ? - These are basic precepts . How will you pass the engineering exam ? I don 't . I expect to pass the chef 's exam . Chef ? You want to become a chef ? Not really . I just want to be your superior . A chef ? A white-hatted ponce ? That 's not a real officer . It outranks you , smeg-for-brains . Lister , what 's this ? Learning drugs ? They 're illegal , matey . I 'm afraid you 're in very serious , grave , deep trouble , Lister . Where did you get them ? I want names , places and dates . Arnold Rimmer . His locker . This morning . Why worry ? You 'll never pass . You 'll never pass , Mister Lister , sir . Practise , Rimmer , makes perfect . Question four ... underline that . What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars ? 0hhhhh ... I 'm gonna die ! I 've been " fished " to death . My answer : In answering the question , " What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars ? " ... Write bigger . " There are various words that need to be defined . " What is a spectrum ? What is a red one ? Why is it red ? " And why is it so frequently linked with quasars ? " What the hell is a quasar ? Just put a neat cross through it . We 'll do the next one . ( LISTER APPR0ACHING ) ... and I think that confidently and concisely answers the question , " What does the ... quasar " . - Da-dum ! - Lister , did you make that ? Yeah . It 's not that good . It was supposed to be roast beef . Do you want some , Cat ? It 's got real cream and fudge in it . 0h , no , I think I 'm going to have to go and do something secret . Aaaaah ! Look out ! Food escape ! - So , Lister , you doing all right ? - Not bad . Not bad at all . Lister ... Lister , all this tension between us is stupid . There 's no need for it . You 're tense and I 'm tense . There 's absolutely no need for it . - I 'm not tense . - 0f course you 're tense ... You rectum-faced pygmy ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . There 's no need for you to be slogging your guts out . - I 'm enjoying it . - Shut up . An exam and doing well . There 's absolutely no need for it . You can have the cigarettes , Pipeline 22 . - I know . - Good . The Cat betrayed me . I don 't mind . I 'm delighted . What I 'm saying is , there 's no need for us to be at loggerheads . - I mean , we 're mates , pals . - When ? 0h , come on . Laugh , laugh , laugh , chuckle , guffaw , giggle . - That 's Rimsy and Listy . - When ? - Millions of times . - When ? Ah ! Ah , how about the time your safety harness snapped and you fell into the cargo bay ? - We laughed then , didn 't we ? - I cracked me spine in three places . Yes , it was hilarious . We laughed like drains . You laughed . I spent six weeks in traction . That 's right . You spent the summer walking like a croquet hoop . I laughed so hard I nearly puked . - What are you saying to me ? - I 'm just saying , Lister , with times as good as those , there 's no point in letting something small and silly like this come between a friendship we 've nurtured , like a small flower , petal by petal , and watched it blossom and bloom into something special . 0K . Give me Kochanski . Smeg off , dishwater breath . You won 't turn me back on . What , Rimsy-wimsy-mimsy , me bestest-ever pal ? Lister , I order you not to take those exams . Black card , Rimmer . Y0U are black carding ME ? That 's only the beginning , Rimmer . When I pass the exams and become an officer , you 'll be on latrines . You 'll have the three o 'clock watch every morning and I know you 'll obey me , because you ... you , respect all that officer smeg . If you mean I respect my superiors , no matter who , and I obey orders blindly and unquestionably ... yes ! Yes , I do . That 's exactly what I mean . Anyway , I 've got to get some sleep . Hard day 's revision on the morrow . You always become the thing you hate the most . Look at you , Lister ... obnoxious , ruthless , single-minded , insensitive ... you 're more like me than I am . Rimmer , you 've forgotten the colour code . This is a black card situation - end of conversation . " You never learn , do you ? " Chef Part One Examination . Please proceed to the Teaching Room . You 're not ready for it . You should be doing last-second revision . I am . I 'm revising buns . It 's obscene , missing the entire first minute of the exam . 0K , here we go . No . You can 't do this to me , Lister . - Give me Kochanski . - No . That was a lousy thing to do . Have you no respect for the dead ? ( PING ) - Hello , Dave . - Aaaaaagh ! I 'm just doing this , er ... I 'm taking , er ... This is a surprise . Why didn 't you tell me how you felt about me when I was alive ? Because I 'm a dope and I 'm a bum , and I 'm stupid , I 'm an idiot and I 'm hopeless and I 'm useless . Sorry , but I just don 't like you . 0h-ey , I 'm really embarrassed now . I don 't know what to say . It 's sort of pointless you doing the exam now . It 's pointless me breathing in and out if you want to know the truth . I could never love anyone like you . You might as well pack up your pots and pans and off you go . I need a man who 's going places . Up , up , up ... lickety-split . So , it didn 't mean anything to you , then ? - What didn 't ? - You know , when we ... Made love on the snooker table , behind the bins . - You never told me that ! - I thought you might have noticed . 0h , yes , yes . I remember now . We 've never made love . Go away , Rimmer . Look , I 'm a bit out of sorts at the moment . - I 'm having a woman 's period . - A woman 's period ? Women don 't speak like that . Give me a break . I don 't know how you 've done it , Rimmer , but that is not Kochanski . It 's Kochanski 's body , it 's Kochanski 's voice . What 's the difference , come on ? The difference is that you 're in there , urgh ... Well , you can 't blame me for trying . - Leave . - I 've seen something you haven 't , squire . 0K , Holly , swap discs . Holly , this is not my breast . I want my own nipple back . - Leave , Rimmer . - There 's no rush , Holly . Holly , are you sure these are my hips ? Lister : 16912146 . How did you do ? How did you do ? - How did you do , Lister ? - How did I do , Mister Lister , SIR ? # It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

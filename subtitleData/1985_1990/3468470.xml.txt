That money 'll bring you no pleasure . - Could I have a word ? - l promise you ! - You just try and sleep tonight . - l 'll sleep like a baby . Oh , shit ! We 'd like to rent your boat . - You what ? - We 'd like to rent your boat . We 'd like to rent your boat . For 27 days . If that wouldn 't be too long for you . No . Yeah ! Yeah ? 27 ? That 's my lucky number . Holy sh ... smokes ! Hi . Jack Bonner . How you doin ' ? - Hi , Jack. I 'm Walter . - Hi , Walter . Well , come on . Take a look around . Boat sleeps eight , so you should be pretty comfortable . If you 've got a latitude and a longitude , I can get you there . - lf you don 't , I can still get you there . - We know a great dive spot . We have a map . Great . Great . Uh ... Guess we can talk price later . Oh , that door basically slides back and forth. lt may need some oil . I haven 't dusted in a while . But I 'm gonna do a whole cleanup , the whole sanitation thing . If you look at anything closely enough , you 're bound to find flaws . I 'm an experienced scuba diver and tour guide , deep-sea fisherman ... Who will actually eat tonight ! Yes ! In the kitchen ! You 're in the kitchen . And my mother went out on the porch , and she was screaming ... - Give it a rest , Rose . - " You stop teasing your sister ! " - Hiya , Grandpa ! - Here 's the little fella . - Come right to the courts , do ya ? - lt 's Thursday . He knows our schedule . - Hi ! - Here 's David . He 's always here . Does this kid have a home or what ? Bernie ! His parents are divorced , his mother works ... I 'm an orphan . Do I go around asking ' for breaks ? We 're goin ' swimming later . We have room left for one little boy . And we might even have a swimming suit for you . - l got mine on . - Oh , the navy could use men like you . The property 's been tied up in an estate now for over three years . And , of course , they really want to sell . They 're not interested in a long-term lease . We 'd just like the place for 26 days . And we 'll take it in as-is condition . We 're cousins . We like to vacation together , informally . As long as there 's a swimming pool , we have everything we need . Uh , $ 7500 a month , plus the pool man and utilities . We won 't be needing the pool man . I prefer to do that myself . They use so much chlorine . My eyes are very sensitive . - Oh , but they 're lovely . - Thank you . Clubhouse is closed , boys . Well , maybe they 'd give us permission to use the pool . - We could offer to pay something . - Wouldn 't be fun if we had permission . Jack , this is the chart I was telling you about . I estimate our position is right about here . This point . - l wanna get down right along this fault line . - ls this land ? What is this ? This is actually an underwater-configuration map . - A heat-sensitive map . - l 've seen these . - Yeah , it 's a brand-new development . - The Japanese have this . That 's right , Jack . The Japanese developed it . So the point is to head directly south , right along this line , until we get right here on the edge of this fault line . - You can figure that out ? - Yeah . Actually , I 've been around here . - Why don 't you keep this ? - OK . Go get some sodas and sandwiches . - Thanks , Jack . - OK . All right , let 's start with line three . - T-O-Z . - And the next line . L-P-E-O . Try the next line . K-O-C ... K-O-C-F-E . Uh , sir , do you have another pair of glasses ? I don 't need any other glasses , young man . These are my glasses. I can read that fine . Now you just run the pointer , all right ? Next line . - ls there anything on that line you can read ? - No . But , young man , remember , road signs aren 't made that small . I can read road signs . OK . I don 't think it 's fair. I 've driven everything on wheels all my life and never had a mishap . Shit . How 's your girlfriend ? She 's not my girlfriend . She just followed me home that one day . I don 't like her at all . You don 't , huh ? - Hi , Dad . - Hi , honey . Hi , Mom . - Wanna go out to dinner ? - Yeah ! No Italian food . Makes me fart . OK. I 'll go get Mom . You know , you 're gonna have to make a friend your own age one of these days . I don 't like the kids my age . I like to hang around you guys . Sure you like it here . There 's no pressure , and we baby ya . - More things bother me than other guys . - Oh , they do , do they ? Trouble with you is , you think too much , and that 's when a guy gets scared . You know , Grandpa , you 're right . I do get scared a lot . Nobody likes being ' scared . Watch out . Those dolphins look pretty horny . - This is pretty big . - Yeah , pretty big . - You need a hand ? - No . No , thanks , Jack . We 're doing fine . Excuse me . - What the hell is that ? - Who cares ? You know , I bet they 're dope peddlers . I bet they made a pick-up out at sea . - lt 's possible . - Should we tell somebody ? Huh ! No ! By golly , if our new neighbours do that , I don 't feel bad about sneaking ' in their swimming pool while they 're gone . - You think it 's safe ? - What are they gonna do , arrest us ? - Look at us . We 're three harmless old men . - Who knows what kind of people they are ? You know , I can 't remember the last time I really took a risk . Ben 's right. I 'm in . What the hell ? Look at that . The water 's really warm . What the hell are those ? Listen to that ! They make me nervous . If Ben Luckett decides to jump off the Empire State Building , do you have to do it too ? I have my pride . - l feel great . - Me too . You wouldn 't bullshit me ? My God , I 'm telling the truth ! Why shouldn 't he feel good ? I feel tremendous ! I 'm ready to take on the world ! * l 'm in the mood for love * Simply because you 're near me You get a load of this guy ? He 'll be chasin ' them dolls till his dick rots off . I 'm too old for that kind of thing . - Ah , hey , age isn 't everything . - No , no . - Anyway , it 's all up here . - Oh , sure . Sure . It 's not all up there , pal . Some of it 's down here . Which , by the way , is hard as a rock . - You too ? You got a boner too ? - Blue steel . Cat couldn 't scratch it . I thought I was the only one . * We 're in the mood for love * Simply because we 've got one You tired ? Aren 't you ? I 'm wide awake . - What 's wrong ? - Not a thing . Art ! It 's so late .

Hi . Looks like you got these things pretty well covered . Looks airtight . Jack , I can 't tell you what 's inside there . You know , I 'm the captain . Technically speaking , I have to know what 's in there . Yeah , but what we 're doing is supposed to be a secret . Kitty , I took a maritime oath . A maritime oath ! It forbids me to even reveal your names to anybody . All right , I 'll tell you . But you can 't let the others know that I told you anything . They 'd have to torture me . Not a lot of torture , you know , but some . Nerita peleronta . - Ner ... what ? - Nerita peleronta . - What is that ? - They 're giant snail shells . They 're extremely rare . We 're taking them to the Museum of Ichthyology in Orlando . Oh , really ? Yeah , I 've been planning to go there . I hear it 's a great place . A lot of fish . Oh , God . Oh , God , I think it 's broken . Goddamn it ! - Let me help you . - Some ice . Get something cold on it . - Let me look . - Do not touch it . - l can help you . - No , no , no , no ! That feels nice . That 's amazing . - Kitty , you married ? - No . - involved ? - No . Come on . Those guys are so good-lookin ' . Not Walter , maybe , but ... You don 't have anything goin ' with one of the young guys ? I 'm not involved with anyone . OK . You know , we could go out and do something , sometime . - l don 't know if that 's such a good idea . - Why ? - l 'm not like the other women you 've known . - That 's good news . You 're makin ' me very curious about you . Well , what if I trusted you with something very private ? Oh , I can keep a secret. I wouldn 't tell anybody . Not even our kids . Look , I don 't know what you 're thinkin ' . But if you 're thinkin ' that I 'm just out to nail you , that 's not it at all . I 'd just like to get to know you , as a human being . OK. I 'll see you in the morning , all right ? What ? Yeah , I got some things to do too . They didn 't give you any other medication at all over at the home , huh ? Not a thing , Doc . Well , Joe , I gotta tell you , I have never seen anything like this before in my life ! It 's a ... Well , it 's a miracle ! It 's a complete remission . I just love to see you eat your words , Doc . - Want to arm wrestle ? - No ! How about that ? ! - Alma 's not gonna believe this . - You 've got ' em ? Ah ! Come on . Let 's go , shall we ? I 'm gonna go ahead and assume goodwill . I 'm gonna assume mental illness . Oh , Bernie. I didn 't expect it . It 's such a surprise ! - l don 't know how to do it. I didn 't buy it . - lt 's just beautiful . Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen . We start our second session of dancing now . Our first tune is a special arrangement of " Dancing in the Dark " . Let 's waste no time . - Why don 't we dance ? - What ? Oh , sure ! Oh , Bernie , Bernie , Bernie , what am I going to do with you ? I don 't know what I 'm going to do with you . - Well , you 're not gonna dance with me . - That 's for sure .

Everything 's happening so fast . - Are you talking about last night ? - No , no . Last night was fine . Fine ? More than fine ! Terrific ! I was talking in general . Well , in general , I think we 're having a great time ! Yes , we are . Will you still love me when I can 't keep up with you ? Of course. I love you now , and you can 't keep up with me . You are a pain in the ass ! " There 's gonna be a problem in the fuel-injection system if ... " What does this do ? Reduced to a goddamn Peeping Tom now , Bonner ? It 's embarrassing . Holy shit ! Look ... What 's the problem , Jack ? She 's not normal . There 's something very abnormal about her . Come on , come on , come on ... Son of a bitch . Come on . Start ! Go ! Come on ! I 've had all kinds of people on this boat . All kinds ! From all races ! Come on ... All nationalities ! All creeds ! Oh , my God , I can 't believe it ! It won 't start ! Oh , my God . It 's ... It 's hard to know who to trust . Isn 't it , Jack ? Oh ! Oh , my God ! Oh , God ! I 'm in the water , far from shore . It 's at night . They got my boat . Shit . Oh , my God ! Good to see you again , Jack . Let me give you a hand . I don 't want your hand . Get back ! Get back ! You get back ! Oh , no . Just put the towel down . Just put it down and back away , please . I 'm sure you 're bothered by what you saw , but relax ... - l don 't wanna relax ! - Why not let us explain ? Cos I don 't wanna know anything . And if you try to eat my face off , or take over my body , you 're gonna be very sorry , mister . You 're gonna be very sorry ! Face-eating , Jack ? I 've never heard of that . is that some sort of delicacy ? No . Forget I ever mentioned it . - Are you sure I shouldn 't try it , Jack ? - l 'm positive . Walter , Jack is our friend . Right , Jack ? Friend ... Friend ! That 's right . Friend . 100 % . I 'm your friend . That 's all I ever wanted to be . Your friend . - But we do owe you an explanation . - No , you don 't owe me anything . You don 't ... Not even for the boat , honestly. it 's free . Jack . Of course we 're gonna pay you for the boat . We 're honest . Well , of course you 're honest ! Did I ever accuse you of being dishonest ? I accused you of being from another planet . But an honest planet . Jack . Jack , sit down . - l don 't wanna sit down . - Jack , sit ! Now , Jack , I want you to listen to me very carefully . We 're Antareans . We come from a planet called Antarea . Yeah , that 's what I pretty much figured . 100 centuries ago , we had an outpost here on Earth , before the first upheaval . - Well , I think I 'm better off not knowing . - Shh . We were able to evacuate everyone except for my ground crew . - Ground crew ? - And now we 've come back for them . Boy. I thought I 'd been around . Nothing like this has ever happened to me before . Now , Jack , you could turn us in . Or you could do something else to make things difficult for us . But believe me , Jack , we will still get our friends back . And the only thing that would happen is that we 'd end up renting someone else 's boat . You know , I got left behind once . It was in Coney lsland. I was nine . It was pretty heavy for a nine-year-old . My parents finally came back for me . Of course . And now we 've come back . - So you 're comin ' back for your friends ? - Exactly . Jack , this is the most important thing we 've ever done . You 're not gonna hurt me , are you , Walt ? All we need to do is to get our friends and leave . And go ... pfft ? - Yes . Pfft . - Right . Pfft , pfft , pfft , pfft . - None of this is bad for America , I guess ? - Of course not . Well , damn it , I 'm in . This ... This is incredible . Right . Now , nothing 's gonna fall off , is it ? No . - Come on , Mr Lefkowitz . - You 'll love it . - You 'll be a new man , Bernie , believe me . - Remember , I said I 'd look . - l 'm not promising I 'll get wet . - Fine . Just look . By the way , right here is where a crime is being committed . Not by me , because I 'm being carried . Don 't you worry , Bernie . We 'll take the fall for you . Fall ? That 's another thing . I fall , I break my hip , I can 't sue anybody . - lt 's nice and warm , Bernie . - They 're rocks . What are rocks doing in a pool ? In an ocean , fine . There I expect to see plenty of rocks . But in a pool ? No . Hah ! Cowardly cowardly custard ! Can 't cut the mustard ! Come on , Bernie ! And it 's Joe ... Joe taking the lead ... Come on ! Come on , navy ! Come on ! Come on , you worn-out old pusses ! Dig , dig , dig , dig , dig ! I 'll see you tomorrow . Hey , fellas ? Fellas , fellas , hey ! Somebody 's comin ' . Let 's get out ! Let 's get out of here . Come on ! Let 's go . Come on ! - Come on . Get a move on . - Come on. ln here . - Out of the way ! - Let 's move ! - Jesus ! - Let 's move ! Come on , open the fuckin ' door . Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! I begged you not to go . You 've got to do something . There are things from outer space next door . You gents keep suckin ' on that oxygen . They 'll probably go back to their own planet . - Get the police , you idiots . - Hey , look . I 'm not callin ' no cops because a couple of geezers saw some people from outer space . If my husband said he saw people from outer space , they were from outer space ! - Get the goddamn police ! - OK . Call the police . Whoo ! They must have concocted this crazy story to cover themselves . Spacemen , you say ? That 's wonderful ! Well , we 'll all be that old someday. lf we 're lucky . Yeah . Well , we 're gonna shoot on over to the home and straighten this whole thing out . I wouldn 't be too hard on ' em . Just tell ' em , as long as they 're willing to respect our privacy in future , we won 't press charges . - We 'll keep ' em on their side of the fence . - Thank you . My pleasure . Bye-bye . Well , I guess we shouldn 't be greedy about it . We 're better off than before we found it . Bess said we should take it to The National Enquirer . They pay money for this kind of story . I wish I had the guts to go in . Yeah . Boy , I wish I never even knew about this place . Oh . What time is it ? Just after four . I 'm gonna go talk to him . Goddamn , it 's ridiculous . Hey , Walter . Well , I 'm not surprised you 're here . There 's something in that pool a friend of ours just has to have . Matter of fact , there 's a few of us could use a little of it . We don 't care who you are , where you 've been , what you 're doin ' , what you 're up to . Sure need that pool . Look , Ben , I know you 're just trying to help your people . Well , I 'm trying to help mine . No , see , my friend Joe Finley , he 's got cancer . I 'm trying to save his life . I 'm trying to save 20 lives . And I 'm running out of time . No son of a bitch has to know we 're in that pool . We 'll just be a few old farts paddlin' around in that pool . Who 's gonna know ? Every ten or eleven thousand years or so , I make a terrible mistake . The last one was when I picked what you call Atlantis as our base here on Earth . Everyone else said use the North Pole . I said " No , too cold . " Sinking never occurred to me . You 're gonna let us use the pool , aren 't you ? You won 't touch those cocoons ? No . No , I swear . Use the pool . Thank you . Thank you ! - l , for one , don 't believe this alien crap at all . - You don 't believe your husband ? - No . - l believe Joe. I believe him and I 'm scared . - l don 't believe it and I 'm still scared . - l guess I 'm just less gullible . Mary , you have your nerve ! I have more horse sense than you ever had . Ladies , ladies . Let 's just go and see for ourselves . Come on . All right . Let 's meet the aliens ! I hate to go visiting without a plate of cookies or a box of candy . - We 're going home . - Will you cut it out , Bernie ? - We have permission , don 't we ? - Those people aren 't people . - l 'm not gonna have anything to do with ' em . - Oh , pipe down . You 're playin ' with fire over there . I 'm a citizen. I believe in this country . I 'm thinkin ' of blowing ' a whistle on the whole deal . Come on , Rose . - Stop right there . - Oh , what . What ? - Stop thinkin ' about yourself . This is for Joe . - Joe ? is Joe above the law ? Are any of us ? - ln 1948 , Dutch Schultz walked into my store . - Bernie . Bernie , shut up ! - Let me tell you about what Dutch said . - Bernie . Bernie ! If you don 't wanna do this for Rose , if you don 't wanna do it for yourself , that 's fine . - But if you screw it up for us ... - Don 't threaten me , Joe . Bernie , please . Let her come with us . Just this once . No , no . Never . Rose and I will never set foot over there again . Nature dealt us a hand of cards . We play them . Now , at the end of the game , suddenly you 're lookin ' to reshuffle the deck ? Huh ? Oh , come on , Rose . Come on , let 's go . Anybody have second thoughts ? - Not me . - l 'm a citizen too . I was in the navy . I don 't see anything wrong with it . Then you drive. I got no licence . * How would you like to spend the weekend in Havana ?

But you stole it for me . Max never stole anything for me . And he never made anything as beautiful as that mouton collar . Max couldn 't do anything with his hands . Except when they were all over me . But you wouldn 't even kiss my cheek without asking . Dumping Max was the smartest move I ever made . Oh , Bernie ... Time for your medicine. I 'll get it . Here you are . Rose . Rose ? Are you asleep ? Rose ? Rose ? Rose ! Rose ... Rose . I 'm so sorry . Can you help me ? I have to do something for her . She ... she ... The pool doesn 't work any more. lt 's too late . I 'll give you everything I 've got . I 'm sorry , Bernie . I wish I could help you. lt 's just too late . Rosie ? Oh , Rosie ... - Hello , Ben . - Walter . I thought maybe you guys had got out of here already , after what happened today . I came by to tell you I 'm sorry , Walter. I ... I know we let you down and I 'm really sorry . I had never experienced the pain and ... the grief associated with death before . I ... never had anyone close to me who died . Walter , these things out here . Can you take them back with you on that spaceship ? No . They would never survive the flight . Well , can you put ' em back in the ocean ? Two are gone now . Two of my friends are gone . We don 't have time to get them all back in the ocean . We must leave this place tomorrow . What if we do it tonight ? We 'll help you . - Bring that one around here , OK ? - Let me give you a hand with that . There are a lot more . Take this one outside and come back . - OK . Got it ? - l can 't do this alone . - Hey , could somebody give me a hand ? - Set it over there . - OK ? - Come on , let 's go . Let 's get a hold of it . Our base was sinking . The time to prepare a passage for all of us was gone . These 20 chose to stay behind so the rest of us could leave safely . They survived here in the ocean for 10,000 years . They can survive again . - OK ? - Yes . - How you guys doin ' ? - OK . - You OK ? - l 'm fine. I 've been diving before . Oh , yeah ? I want you all to consider very carefully what I 'm about to suggest to you . You and your friends seem to want what we 've got . Well , we have room for you . We have room for you and about 30 more of your friends . You would be students , of course , but ... But you 'd also be teachers . And the new civilisations that we 'll be travelling to will be unlike anything you 've ever known . But I promise you , you will all lead productive lives . - For ever ? - We don 't know what " for ever " means . I got a couple of things I ... - Not a good cast . - .. I need to talk about with you . - Yeah ? - Yeah . I guess me and your grandma are goin ' away , David . - Where to ? - Well , that 's not important . What 's important is that ... when we get where we 're goin ' ... we 'll never be sick , we won 't get any older and we won 't ever die . - You 're joking me , right ? - No . No . Would I be able to visit you and Grandma ? No . And we wouldn 't be able to visit you either , and that kinda bothers me . I 'd never see you again ? No . When would you go , if you did ? Soon , my boy . Soon . - And do you know where ? - Where ? Look up . Outer space , my lad . Outer space . Who 's gonna take you to outer space ? It don 't matter . You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . And I can 't tell your mother , because she 'd then know her old man had snapped his cap . I wonder if they 'll have fishing ' holes there ? There 's some things they won 't have . They won 't have grandsons and they won 't have ... baseball games , and they won 't have hot dogs , and they won 't have that kind of stuff . I 'm gonna miss ' em . All right , cast it out there . I wish we 'd get a bite . I 'd like to catch one more great big fish . You know how much we love you , don 't you ? Of course I do . I just don 't want you to forget how much we care , no matter what we say or do . Of course . - Bye , Grandpa . - Goodbye , little man . Smile . Bye , Dad . Bye , Mom . Stop by next week sometime , OK ? Be a good boy . Mind your mom . You havin ' second thoughts ? Yes . - So you think we 're cheatin ' nature ? - Yes . Well , I 'll tell you something . The way nature 's been treatin ' us , I don 't mind cheating ' her a little . - You 'll be closing your account , Mr Selwyn ? - Yes , I will . - All in $ 100 bills ? - Mm-hm . Here you go . This is for you . Sir ! Here . Have fun ! Have fun , my friends , have fun ! Here , divide it up , girls ! Divide it up ! There you are , there you are ! * Racing with the moon ! Hey , enjoy , enjoy ! * Sailing to the midnight sun ... He can come in for a minute . Hi . They say if we go with them , we 'll live for ever . Well , that 's good. lt 's probably going to take you an eternity to forgive me . I 'm sorry , Alma . I guess I 've been ridiculous. I am sorry . I love you . You 're my whole life . I want to go . But if it 's a choice of only six more months here with you , or living for ever all by myself , well , I 'll take the six more months here with you . I don 't wanna live for ever if you 're not gonna be with me . - So you definitely trust them ? - We trust ' em . Men should be explorers , no matter how old they are . I don 't know about anybody else , but I 'm going . Why the hell not ? We 're in . Are you nervous ? Me ? No . You 're sure you want to do this ? Once I make a decision , Arthur , I never turn back . This is a big one . I know . Yeah , it 's gonna be 72 and clear tonight . A great night to see that total lunar eclipse . Check it out . But don 't get weird on me , people . Let 's go . Let 's go . Quick . Get me a glass of water . Look out . - Don 't do that ! - What is the meaning of this ? David ? You staying up for the eclipse ? You don 't seem too enthusiastic . Did you and Grandpa have a fight today ? No . What did he say to you ? David , I 'm very worried about Grandpa and Grandma . What did he say to you ? I can 't tell you . They 're my parents , David . You 've got to tell me what he said to you . He made me promise . Mom ? Dad ? Mom ? Dad ? Hey , Bernie ! Come on ! You 're coming with us , Bernie ! No. I came to say goodbye .

Goodbye , Bernie . - Goodbye , Bernie . - Bye . We 'll miss you . Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on . Go . Only when I need it , right ? Only when I need it . Jesus ... - l know something is wrong . - They 're probably out dancin ' . Those folks love to dance . Could we talk to one of their friends ? We 'll go see Pops . Will that satisfy ya ? Pops . Pops ? Got a little game of 20 questions for ya . Pops ! Oh , shit ! Hello ?

 [ theme music ] [ intense music ] Can I , uh , see your ID , sir ? Sure . [ buzzing ] Now , open the gate or I 'll fry your brains . Open it ! ( male on speaker ) All soldiers down [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] [ all screaming ] Hey , you , halt ! I said , halt ! [ buzzing ] Open the case . Are you crazy , soldier ? This is top secret . Open it ! [ buzzing ] They never learn do they , Leo ? How are we gonna get in now ? Watch Lex Luthor show you the way . [ buzzing ] They were wearing ROTC uniforms . Schuster university is the only school in this area with an ROTC program . [ knocking on door ] Major , T.J. White , Clark Kent . The two students I mentioned , the ones who could help us . I sure hope so . This , uh , gun that was taken ... exactly what is it ? The Thermatron 14 is a heat seeking laser weapon and can be handled like a rifle . It 's calibrated to seek out body temperature . Can kill a man out of 1000 yards by pointing in his direction . Very scary . - No pictures , please . - No .. This project has not been cleared for publication . Yeah , I 'll make sure that doesn 't happen again , major . I told the major you 'd do some investigating on campus . Anything you can come up with we 'll appreciate it . Yeah , well , we 'll give it a try , Lieutenant . Um , lieutenant , I-I was just gonna say well , just because they had ROTC uniforms on doesn 't mean they had to be students . From the evidence that seems to be our best bet . Uh , how about going in that direction for now ? Like , right now . - Oh . - Oh . Only one student I know who could do something like this . - Lex ? - Luthor , man ? He didn 't even belong to ROTC . You think a little detail like that 's gonna get in his way . Guess not . Hey , Lex , the word 's out that the ROTC guys are assembling on campus in full dress Mmm-hmm . Seems that the army brass are on their way in to identify some crooks , who made off with some army equipment . What 's happened to patriotism in this country , Leo ? It 's a sad commentary when even the army is no longer sacred . Oh , you 're right , Lex , it 's a sad commentary . Have you contacted our clients , yet ? Um , yeah , all three of the organizations . One 's ready to deal right now . But the other two have to wait for some higher authority . Is that a fact ? Well , I 'm a patient man right , Leo ? That 's right , Lex . No one can accuse you of impatience . So , why don 't we just deal with the one who 's ready now ? 'Cause Leo , the fun of the game is not just the profit . It 's the delight in watching them bid against each other . The joy of observing their anxieties . Their terror of feeling to acquire what they 've been ordered to acquire . Electric , isn 't it ? That 's sour thinking , Lex . - Sour thinking . - Mmm-hmm . Oh , but what 's this all about ? Entrepreneurship . Foresight . Chemical warfare , Leo . One must think ahead . Now , what good is it gonna do to interview Lex Luthor ? I mean , his-his sickening arrogance is only exceeded by his lying skill . That 's true , but if we can get into his dorm room- - Wa-Wait . Is he gonna be dumb enough to keep hot army equipment in his dorm room . No , but we might be find a clue as to where he 's hiding it . I feel we 're doing injustice by suspecting the guy without any proof . Wa-wait . There 's nothing that can be done to Lex Luthor that can be considered an injustice . Hi ! So who 's buyin lunch today ? Depends . If you eat your usual quarter we 'll run out of money . There is a woman starving here and you makin ' a joke . Oh , I 'm just kinda warming ' up . - Come on , come on . - Okay . Absorbs into the pores . It 's brilliant . [ intense music ] Uhh ! [ alarm ringing ] [ people screaming ] [ upbeat music ] Superboy ! Titanium and phosphorous . Didn 't your mother teach you not to play with unstable chemicals ? Right up , there . [ mellow music ] Lex ! Are you alright ? - I don 't know ? - Here . Lie down . Superboy saved my life . Yeah . You 're being so nice . Don 't try and talk , Lex . Where did you disappear ? You were right behind me . He left me in the dust . You should go off a track . So what happened ? Well , Mr. Wonderful , nearly blew himself up in the lab . And then finally , Superboy did a disservice to humanity . He saved Lex Luthor . You think you can stand up ? Why is she letting him do that ? Hey , don 't worry about Lana . She knows how Lex really is . Right . Hai ! About . Hai ! Right . Hai ! Uh , thank you , Lieutenant . It 's none of these . Thanks . No luck . Wish we could be of more help , Lieutenant . Army intelligence is anxious to get Superboy into this . Like you guys to get a message to him if you can . [ horn blowing ] - Out of the way . - Watch out , guys . I like it . I love it . All these red roses are for Lana . Lex is a nice guy , isn 't he , Felix ? This is for you , Lana . Thank you , Leo . Grab that one . From , uh , guess who ? Gee , I wonder , considering who the messenger is . I knew you would act like this . But I just expect a little bit more from you , Clark . " To a very gracious woman from a very grateful man . Lex " ( T.J. ) I hear it , but I ... Why are you guys such downers ? Lex is trying so hard to be nice . - You think he 's trying hard . - I think he is convincing her . Would you stop referring to me like I 'm not here ? - What are you so angry about ? - I 'm not angry . I mean , can 't you give anyone the benefit of the doubt . Lana , here , read my lips we 're talking about Lex Luthor . - Hello ? - If you 'll excuse me . I 'm gonna go put the flowers in some water . Okay , if you run short , there 's a reservoir couple miles down . Ah ! Oh , Clark . [ knocking on door ] It 's unlocked , Leo . - Hey , Lex , looking good . - Thanks , Leo . This is the first time you ever said , thanks , to me . I 'm in a pretty good mood . I got the calls we 've been waiting for . All three organizations are ready to deal . Well ... I 'm not ready for them . Lex , but this is what we 've been waiting for . Let them wait . Lex , begging your pardon , but what could be more important than what we 've been talking about ? Lana Lang . [ mellow music ] [ knocking on door ] Lana , it 's Lex . Lex ? - Hi . - Hi . [ knocking on door ] Excuse me there , boss . But we 'd like to talk to Lex . Um , he 's not here . He 's out on a date . Oh , yeah . We 'd like a word with you then ... Leo . You know , Leo , the whole ROTC is under suspicion about what happened at the army base . Yeah , military intelligence . Lieutenant Harris , CIA , FBI . All getting involved here , Leo . If you know anything about uh , couple of missing ROTC uniforms you might wanna say something to somebody well , now 's the time . Okay ? Yeah , I wanna say something to you . Get out . Hold on a second . - Whose Lex got the date with ? - Certain friend of yours . [ knocking on door ] Lex , come on , open up , man . It 's me , Leo . Come on , man . Open up . - Hold on a minute . - Come on , open up the door . It 's unlocked , dummy . Get in here . Okay , Lex , alright . I 'm in , I 'm in . I told you a thousand times to walk like you got a purpose . I just got another call from those guys about the Thermatron 14 . I told you , Leo , that if .. Ho-wow , that 's really rad , man . But don 't you think it 's gone a little bit too far with punk ? Superboy did this to me . He knew there was titanium and phosphorous in the lab . You 're gonna pay for this , Superboy . You 're gonna pay . [ screaming ] ( Lex ) I want you to contact ... All three of ' em . Way to go , Lex . We 're back on track . Don 't interrupt me , Leo . Tell them that Thermatron 14 is available tomorrow morning Wilson 's Field , 9 a.m. , sharp . Are you listening ? Good . I 'll need their top assassins from each organization . Say , cons or assassins ? Lex , I mean , if we 're talking money .. The money is just the icing on the cake , Leo . I 'm talking , Hitmen . Death . Superboy 's death . - Lana . - Uh , hi , Lex . Could you spare me a few moments in private ? Of course . Go , Schister ! Lana , I need a favor , if you would grant it . Consider it granted . Isn 't it a bit warm to be wearing a hat ? Uh , Lex , why did you shave your head ? Not shaved . I 'm bald . Oh , Lex . Made bald , by your friend , Superboy . He would not do that . Deliberately blew those chemicals through my hair . Killing the follicles . You 're not being reasonable , Lex . Damn right , I 'm not being reasonable . Would you be reasonable , if somebody deliberately stole your hair ? On purpose , on purpose . Well , why would he do that ? 'Cause he hates me . You all hate me . No , Lex , you 're wrong . Don 't you ever tell me , I 'm wrong . You hate me . You all hate me . You ! You , obnoxious brains . You hate me because I 'm smarter than you . Now , about that favor I want . You tell Mr. Save Humanity , Superboy that if he wants the Thermatron 14 , it will be at Wilson 's Medal tomorrow morning . Got it ? And give him this . Never mind , it 's all I 've got . Lieutenant Harris called . Wanted to know if you contacted Superboy yet . Not yet . But I got a message in the pipeline . So , Lana , how did your date go , last night ? Lex , hit me . He did what ? He didn 't hurt me . And I was so sure that he had ... well , changed . Now I know why I 'm a romantic washout . You 've to belt a woman to turn her on . - Why did he hit you ? - She looks like his mother . He totally freaked out . Suddenly he 's gone bald . Bald ? As in no hair . Bald . How do you go bald overnight ? I don 't know . He blames Superboy for it . Some wild nonsense about him doing it to him deliberately . I 'm really confused . Just yesterday he was thanking Superboy for saving his life . I know . Oh , he also has a message for Superboy . Tell me what ? I 'll try to pass it onto him . Bald ? [ intense music ] Now , so that there is no misunderstanding let me repeat myself . The one who kills Superboy has first shot to buy the Thermatron 14 . [ horse neighing ] ( Lex ) I like confidence in a killer . Let me caution you , you 'll be facing no ordinary gladiator . That 's why I have brought you an edge . I call it .. ... sonic blaster . I think you 'll find it very effective . Lex ! Look , it 's Superboy . [ upbeat music ] This time you 've gone way too far , Lex . Too far , Superboy ? No . [ buzzing ] Gentlemen , be my guest . Lex , I was worried that Superboy wouldn 't be affected . ( Leo ) Well , you know , with the- - Looks like he 's more vulnerable than anybody else . His super hearing is so sensitive . Aah ! Ah ! Ah ! Cut it off , Lex . You 're killing the ninja . What ? And let Superboy off the hook . ( Lex ) No way . My ear , stop it , stop it . Aah ! ( Leo ) You killed him . But it serves Superboy . [ upbeat music ] It 's time to do the job myself . Lex , let me help you . Idiot . [ mellow music ] And why is it that we fast , brothers ? To partake of the suffering of mankind . Be sure there is suffering . The pains of hunger and of the flesh of the spirit . And we will continue to fast till the end of this month in communion with our tortured brothers on this finite planet , till we obtain infinity . Yeah , brothers we will honor this fast going through our bodies and our spirits . No food or water will pass our lips . And I say , Amen . [ soft music ] [ dramatic music ] Let us , holy brother .. Let us pray for the day .. ... that we may do unto Superboy . And Superboy is done unto us . Captioned by Grant Brown

 Hello ? No . You got the wrong number . Yeah , but ain 't no Thelma here , man . Jesus ! I 'm comin ' ! What ? Man , there ain 't no Thelma here ! God . What ? Ain 't no fuckin ' Thelma here , man ! Look , the bitch don 't live here ! Fuck you too ! Shit ! Fuck ! Hello . I 'm Dr. Warren G. Easterbrook , Chairman of the President 's Commission on Education , and I would like to talk to you about an ever-growing problem ... the short attention span of today 's youth . Weaned as they are on television , young people today ... can 't seem to pay attention for more than a few mo ... Pethouse Video presents an in-depth ... up close and personal look ... at Pethouse Plaything Taryn Steele . Oh , so many neat things have happened to me in my life ... being named homecoming queen , making the cheerleading squad . But the neatest thing ever was when I was recently chosen ... the Pethouse Plaything of the Month . But being a Plaything hasn 't changed me . I 'm still the same Taryn . When I was first chosen , I was , like , really immature . But I 've grown so much since then . I can hardly believe it 's me . I 'm a beach person and a night person . I really feel sorry for anyone who doesn 't live in California , 'cause we 've got it all ... the mountains , the sun . And , like , there 's no humidity . It really blows me away . Here , out of the public eye , I can just fade into the crowd . In New York , I get hassled all the time . I don 't understand it . Laguna offers me peace and solitude ... away from the pressure ofbeing a Plaything . Here in Laguna , I can just let my mind go blank . Art is my life . I love to browse Laguna 's art galleries , and my dream is to one day ... have some of my things hanging here . But my real strength comes from my family ... and my strong religious upbringing . I 'll always be grateful to my mom and dad and the values they 've given me , which help me take on the awesome responsibilities ... of Plaything of the Month . Selma , look at this reception . Beaver , did you bring home a note from your teacher today ? Oh , no , Dad . That 's one of your jokes I haven 't heard before . Record warm temperatures tomorrow . Unbelievable ! Best investment I ever made . You haven 't been out of this house in two weeks . Lows will warm up just a bit . What the hell has happened to my remote ? Sunny skies for the remainder of the day . Murray ? Embedded in those clouds . And here in the southern ... Excuse me , sir . We 're on the air . Selma ! Get me out of here ! I must 've pressed the wrong button . Murray , what are you doing on the weather ? I don 't know . Press something . Bring me back ! Here ! Swung on , and it 's a high fly ball to center field . Wait a minute ! There 's a fan on the field ! ¤ Make me wanna stay If this is it ¤ ¤ Doo wah ¤ Now I 'm trapped in a rock video ! Anything but this ! ¤ If this ain 't love you better let me go ¤ - ¤ If this is it ¤ - ¤ Doo wah ¤ Selma ! Help me ! ¤ If this ain 't love , baby ¤ Wait . Wait . Selma ! I 'm looking for the booklet . Oh , no . I 'm in black and white . Where am I ? This is what you get for throwing out the directions . Help ! Help me ! Here you can leave me for the night . You should be so lucky . Where am I ? You 're on the Disney Channel . At least I know you won 't catch anything there . Fun is fun , Selma , but I want to come home . I 'm trying . 500 million people are watching via satellite ... as the president and first lady deplane for this historic Moscow visit . They look fit and rested . Wait a minute . An unidentified man has emerged from Air Force One . He seems , believe it or not , to be clad only in his underwear . The Secret Service have grabbed him . Where am I ? I 'm innocent ! But who is he and how did he get on board ? I was only watching television ! He appears to be deranged . Help ! Selma ! I 'm so proud of you , Brenda , getting through the delivery without any anesthetic . Well , I had the best Lamaze coach in the world . When do we get to see the baby ? It 's been eight hours . Well , you remember the film they showed us in class . There 's all kinds of tests they have to perform on a newborn child . So ... That 's true . Ah ! There 's my favorite couple . - Mr. And Mrs. Flanders . - That 's Landers . Right , right . Flanders is uremic poisoning on 39 . - So . - Um ... Nice stitch work , if I say so myself . Doctor , we 'd like to see our son . The nurses keep giving us the runaround . I 'd like nothing better than to bring you both your son , but have you looked around this hospital ? There are sick people here . I just saw this old guy in the hallway with these gnarly scabs all over his body . Gross me out ! - I 'm not about to expose your little Jeffrey ... - Nicholas . To that . I 've got a solemn oath to uphold here . Doctor , Brenda and I are both Lamaze graduates , and we 've never heard of quarantining a healthy infant before . Ooh , Lamaze . Well , I forgot that you spent three whole weekends sitting on a floor ... learning how to breathe . I had to get by on a degree from Harvard Medical School ! Please , it 's important to us to see our child . You 've heard of bonding . Uh ... Doctor . We 'd like to spend a little quality time with our son , please . A little quality time with your son ? That would be beautiful . You people . What 's with that guy ? Mrs. Fernandez , front desk . He 's supposed to be the top man in his field . Well , when he brings in little Jeffrey , we 're going ... Nicholas ! Here we go . - Here 's the little tyke . Okay , that 's enough germs . Wait ! Wait a minute . We haven 't even seen him yet . Go ahead , breathe all over him . I don 't care . What is this , some kind of sick practical joke ? What are you talking about ? He 's got your eyes . Take that hideous thing away . Come on . They all look like this at first . You see , when the baby passes through the birth canal , its head gets a little pointy . He should round out in a couple days . Promise . That 's not a baby . That 's a Mr. Potato Head . Harry , call the hospital administrator . Hey ! You 're right . This is a Mr. Potato Head . Gosh , they 're so lifelike . Anybody could 've made this mistake . I 'll be right back with the real Nicholas . Harry , what are they doing to us ? Calm down , Brenda . Calm down . We don 't want you to get postpartum anxiety . Now , as soon as we get our son , I 'm going to report this quack . Thank God you took that assertiveness training course . Here 's the little tyke . You 've been a naughty little baby . Yes , you have . Playing peekaboo with Mommy and Daddy . About time . Nick , it 's your dad . He 's got a strong , determined jaw just like his old man there . - Great . Now you made him cry . - I don 't believe this . Is this okay ? Would you rather breast-feed him ? Get away from me ! I 'm gonna kill you ! What kind of hospital is this ? All right , Mr. And Mrs. Lamaze ! You see , due to a slight clerical error , your son has been temporarily misplaced . - You lost our son ? - Did I say lost ? I said misplaced ! I 'm suing you for ... for malpractice , negligence ... you name it ! Just jump all over me ! What about the nine kids I didn 't lose this week ? My baby ! What have they done with my baby ? It was your fault . If you hadn 't distracted me with that video equipment in the delivery room , I might not have misplaced your little brat ! - Doctor . We found him . - See ? He was down the hall in the laundry hamper . Oh ! Oh , he 's beautiful . I hope you 're both ashamed of yourselves . All this hysteria when he was safe and sound not 20 feet from this room . Doctor , you 're due in surgery for that kidney transplant . Where 's the donor organ ? The donor organ ? God , I had it with me when I left the house this morning .

Be right there . Karen ? Hi . Hi . I 'm Jerry Stone . Hi , Jerry . Nice meeting you . I 'm sorry . I 'm running a little bit late . Don 't worry about it . You look nice . Thank you . This is a great apartment . Thanks . Uh , I hope you like sushi . I made reservations at Tokyo Rose on Columbus . Great . I hear it 's terrific . Normally there 's a waiting list , but I know the maitre d ' . You know , I gotta tell you , I never go on blind dates , but , uh , I just have a feeling that this might be special . Jerry ? Before we leave , do me one small favor , will you ? Sure . What ? Would you mind showing me a credit card and a valid driver 's license ? - You 're kidding . Why ? - I 'd like to run a " couple compatibility " check . What the heck is that ? You know , Jerry , it 's tough being a single girl in the big city . You meet all kinds of phonies and creeps . That 's why this machine comes in handy . I just enter your I.D. , and the central computer will tell me about your background . I don 't want a bank loan . I just want to take you out . I know , but I 'd feel better running a check . Two I.D. ' s , please . You 're serious . It 'll just take a minute . This is ridiculous , but , uh ... Here 's , uh ... Three-one-six . That 's a cute picture . MasterCard . I don 't know how I ever got along without one of these . Changed my life . Feel the same way about my VCR . Ooh . Right now I 'm taping Sophie 's Choice with Meryl Streep . - I love Meryl Streep . - Oh , I am so into her . Here it comes now . All that about me ? Geez . They are very thorough . This is great ! - What ? What ? What do you got there ? What 's ... What 's uh-oh ? Jerry , does the name Debbie Rothenberg mean anything to you ? Debbie Rothenberg . Oh , yeah . I think I went out with her once or twice . You had sex with her on the second date , and then you never called her again . - I hate when guys do that . - It says all that ? Does the phrase " You 're not only beautiful , but you 're someone I feel I can open up to " mean anything to you ? I 'm not surprised . You 've used that line on your last 16 dates . Look , this is ridiculous . Debbie ... Uh , Karen , I think ... that we have something very special here . You 're not like the other women you ... " You meet in the city . " See what I mean ? And , Jerry , I could never get serious about someone who 's selfish in bed . " Who 's selfish in bed " ? Well , how would you describe a man ... who satisfies his own needs and rolls over and goes to sleep ? - I never did that in my life ! - Eleven times ! You want names and dates ? No . No , I do not ! Look , hey , hold it . Anyway , that is just a small fraction of the hundreds of times ... I 've been intimate with women . We 're exaggerating a little , aren 't we , Jerry ? The record only shows 21 sexual intimacies . There you are . This doesn 't jibe with my figures . Okay , sweetie ? Jerry , the statistics don 't paint the picture of a mature man . Twelve times , you ignored your date at a party ... to flirt with a more attractive woman . 169 times , you feigned interest when a woman was talking about her career . On 17 occasions , you lied to women , telling them you were really into sushi and Meryl Streep movies . Make that 18 times . Where do they get these figures ? As you can see , Jerry , it would be pointless for you and I to go out . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm gonna get one of those machines and see how well you come off ! Okay ? Good night , Jerry . It 's early yet . Maybe you can still get lucky in a bar . Like you did last Thursday . Hello , Beverly ? This is Jerry Stone . We met the other night at Dave 's party . Listen , I know it 's last minute , but I wanna ask you , are you free tonight ? You are . Great . Listen , I can pick you up in 10 minutes . Sure , okay . Oh , Jerry , um ... Yeah ? Could you bring a major credit card and a valid driver 's license ? Extraterrestrials . Strange phenomena . Missing persons . Lost continents . Myths and monsters . We examine these mysteries to determine ... are they bullshit or not ? London 's West End . Here , in the winter of 1888 , a series of bizarre and violent murders occurred , which remain unsolved to this very day . Jack the Ripper . Was he a prosperous London surgeon ? Perhaps a member of British royalty . Well , our Bullshit team has unearthed ... spectacular new evidence which suggests ... that Jack the Ripper was , in fact , the Loch Ness Monster . Is it possible that Nessie ... murdered five streetwalkers before returning to Loch Ness ? Using undiscovered evidence , we 've pieced together the events leading up to the first murder . Although this is a Bullshit reenactment , it may have happened just this way . Hello , dearie . Show you a good time for a quid . Throw the wife in for free . Oh , gents . Don 't you want a girl to keep you warm tonight ? Me mum told me there would be nights like this . Oh , my ! You are a big one , now , aren 't you ? Come on , darlin ' . Mind you , don 't you be steppin ' on my feet now . Ooh ! Aren 't you in an hurry ! Now , will you be careful . Not so rough , da ... Wait a min ... Is this the way it happened ? Was Jack the Ripper , in fact , a 60-foot sea serpent from Scotland ? Did I take this job for a quick buck ? We may never know the answers to these questions . Next week ... Come on . To recap the three movies that we reviewed this week ... here on Critics Corner , Marc and I both gave a big thumbs up ... to the new Swedish film directed by , uh , Olaf Svensen . Olaf Svensen , called The Winter of my Despondency . - Haunting abstract symbolism . - It 's arty crap . Jonathan and I did split , however ... On the newest teenage romp called Frat Slobs . Jonathan , I think , thought it to be ... a light , frothy soufflé ... sizzling with youthful energy . That I did . On the other hand , I thought it was pond scum . You 're an albino . What the hell do you know ? We have a new feature we 'd like to introduce on Critics Corner ... we hope you 'll enjoy . We call it " Real Life Reviews , " in which we critique the life of an average person just like you . Jonathan will begin with a review of the life of Harvey Putnik . No . Pitnik . Pitnik , of Skokie , Indiana . Illinois . Illinois . Harvey Pitnik of Skokie , Illinois . Bernice . Bernice , come here . They 're talking about me on the television . What ? Come here . Harvey Pitnik would seem to have all the ingredients ... For a successful life . You 'd think so . So why does he fail so miserably ? I don 't know . I think the problem is with Harvey himself . What the hell is this ? You 're right . It is Harvey . Very good , Jonathan . It is Harvey . So , we 're supposed to care about this Harvey Pitnik ? Why ? I mean , it takes him 30 years to develop any character at all , and by the time he does , who cares ? They 're crucifying me . It 's hardly worth the wait . He didn 't like Gandhi either . Let me show you . Here 's a scene from last year as Harvey is coming home from work . Oh . Hi , Scraps . Hi , Dad . Hi , kids . How did they do this ? Hi , honey . Hi , dear . Ooh . Potatoes . I didn 't cons ... I didn 't consent for this to be on TV . Dinner 'll be ready in five minutes . Okay . - Some exciting home life , huh ? - And it goes on like that , tediously , day in and day out . Where 's the love ? Where 's the passion ? Where 's the examination of one 's own existence ? This is a poor excuse for a life . I give Harvey Pitnik a ... a big thumbs down . Thumbs down ? I give him a thumbs down too . But I didn 't hate Harvey quite as much as you , Jonathan . Oh , granted , his life was a miserable waste of time , but I rather enjoyed the Kafkaesque touches . Here 's a loser trapped in a dead-end job ... and a ... a loveless marriage . How do they know that ? Couldn 't they have done anything to make this man human ? Think of the money it took to bring him into the world . A ton ! To feed him and to clothe him and then to educate him . And after all that , what have you got ? - You 've got a big bore ! - A dull clod ! An empty suit . And another thing , I was always one step ahead of this guy 's life . There just were no surprises ! No . Wait a minute . What about the ending of his life ? That came as a surprise . Ending ? I saw that coming a mile away ! I didn 't . What ending ? The high blood pressure . The lack of exercise . True . Uh-huh . The bad diet . Of course . By the time he finally has his heart attack in front of the TV , big deal ! Heart attack ? Heart attack ? It 's such a mundane way to go . What are they talking about ? A heart attack ? I didn 't have a ...

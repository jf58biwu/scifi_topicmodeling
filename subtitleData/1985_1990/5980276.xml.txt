 [ tires screeching ] [ music continues ] [ waves lapping ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ pleasant music ] [ baby crying ] How do people live like that ? I don 't believe it . Believe it , Clark . [ crying continues ] Oh , wow . ( Lana ) What I want , T.J. is a contrasting shot of life around here . What 's goin ' on over there ? Yeah , you got it . It 's a pleasure doing business with you , Alex . And I think fifteen million is a fair price for this property , don 't you ? Well , speaking of fair price .. Is your A Street property on the market ? I 'm sorry , that building 's not for sale . It 's the first one I put up . I have a sentimental attachment to it . Well , how about the , uh , warehouse on Main Street ? Sorry , Alex . What you 're saying is , uh .. this is the only property you 're selling ? When can I expect the deal memo ? My attorney is drawing up the papers right now . But remember .. ... there 's no deal until you take care of the contingency . ( male # 1 ) There 's nothing that we can do . - Can 't the public help ? - Well , the public .. Listen , people have good intentions as long as you don 't interrupt the smooth flow of their life . ( male # 2 ) Fire ! [ screaming ] ( male # 1 ) Everybody , grab a bucket . Get to the ocean . Move ! Did you see that ? Those guys just threw a firebomb . [ dramatic music ] [ people screaming ] Hey ! Hey , call the fire department . Somebody call the fire department ! Call the fire department . Ask them to drop by if they 're not too busy . [ whooshing ] Our food . It 's ruined ! [ sobbing ] Oh , God .. Alice , Alice , Alice . It 's alright . Look , that sudden wind saved most of our tents . [ sobbing ] How could anybody do something so awful ? Yeah , the man on the terrace is a big help . That , my friends , is Gerald Manfred . Mr. Conglomerate . He is the reason that we 're here homeless . Why don 't you take your people someplace else ? There he is , my people . He was not born to shame . " Upon his brow , shame is ashamed to sit . " Mr. Manfred , they lost their food in the fire . You 've got so much , maybe you could give some to them ? What are you doing here ? You don 't look like you belong with them . My name is Lana Lang . I 'm researching the Palms for the homeless for my political science class . Why don 't you take them back to your political science class and feed them ? Can I quote you on that , Mr. Manfred ? Who the hell are you ? Let 's just say I 'm with the press . T.J. , get a shot of Mr. Manfred . [ camera clicks ] If he takes another picture of me , break his camera . And as for food , young lady , I 'd rather feed the seagulls . [ squawking ] Our kids are starving and he 's throwing food at the gulls . - Why do we take it ? - Damon , Damon , do something . They 're getting out of control . People , don 't do this . You 're playing into his hands . What are you doing ? [ indistinct shouting ] ( Damon ) People , people , people . Don 't , don 't do this . Don 't .. [ shouting continues ] Why arrest them ? They 're just hungry . Ha .. Well , I think I finally removed the contingency . [ intense music ] Come on , everyone . Let 's eat . ( female # 1 ) Oh ! Alice , we know where Damon is , but where is everybody else ? Where they always are at this time . Out hunting for jobs . Any kind of jobs , and looking for food . Even begging for it . I can 't imagine what it does to your spirit to beg . Sometimes , you just have to . You don 't have any money but don 't you have friends relatives , somebody that can help ? No , none of us are from around here . We 've come from all over on the promise of jobs . Obviously , you didn 't get them . Who promised these jobs ? Our savior , Mr. Manfred . He was going to reopen a factory . Television sets , tape recorders , that 's what we all worked on before the industry went sour in America . Why didn 't he open it ? He built a factory in Korea instead . Ha . So much for Made in USA . Those of us who could , went back home . The rest of us were so demoralized . Then Damon showed up from out of nowhere and said we had to fight . Make Manfred come through with his promises . Keep sticking his nose in it until he makes restitution . ( child # 1 ) Mama . Excuse me . There but for the grace of God goes everyone 's mother .. ... or father or us . Good to see you .. - Hey ! - Hey ! Oh , my Lord ! What is all these goodies ? Who do we owe this to ? - You guys did this ? - Yeah . Yes , Alex . I received the deal memo . I 'm looking at it now . There 's one thing I don 't understand you put a cutoff date in . Dated one week from today . That 's true , they 're still on the beach . But I assure you .. You don 't need to remind me that fifteen million dollars is a lot . I guarantee you they 'll be off the beach before the cutoff date . Tell Mr. Baker and Mr. Gruber I wanna see them immediately . They said we had to post bond . I said we can 't afford to post a letter . You have to keep us and feed us . So they gave us a warning , they cut us loose . Damon , we can 't put the rest of the tents up . The pegs blew away or were burned . Alright , let 's form a hunting party and go look for anything to make pegs out of . Damon , when you get some time , I 'd like to talk to you about your thoughts on possible solutions- - How about right now , while we 're with the hunting party ? - Clark ? - You guys go ahead . I 'll stay and help them keep an eye on things . - Anything to avoid exercise . - Right . Whoa ! [ laughs ] And you 've been with them for five months ? Just trying to fight the good fight . Why don 't we try the road ? Maybe we 'll have better luck . [ moans ] Anything to avoid too much exercise ? Right . Look , it will only take five minutes . Take ten . [ dramatic music ] You , come with us . - Who ? - Police ! Irongate Protection Services ? That 's pseudo police . Leave him alone ! [ music continues ] Help him ! ( Damon ) Help him ! Help him , help him . Help him ! Help him ! T.J. T.J. ! ( Damon ) Help him ! Help .. Oh , T.J. The van . T.J. ' s in the van ! ( Lana ) Help him . [ tires screeching ] It 's , uh , good to see you all . You wouldn 't have seen anybody if it wasn 't for Superboy . [ sighs ] Suppose I , I have some thank you cards made up . So next time I 'm in this condition I can send you one . It 's a deal , T.J. Damon , they 've , they 've got Damon- - I know . Take it easy . I was wondering if you could give me a clue as to .. We need a doctor . Um , the first-aid station , there 's a doctor there . Without Damon we 're lost . Can we help ? I wish you could , I don 't see how ? We 've been over every inch of this city looking for jobs and begging food . We know it like nobody else . Of course , the balloons . I 'll be looking too . I 'll be in the air . If you see anything , release a balloon . Wait , they haven 't got any money . Clark should have some . Why is he always disappearing ? Don 't worry about him . He 'll be fine . - Feel better ? - Yeah . Oh , I 've been robbed . - I took it to help Damon . - That 's cool . As long as I know it 's for a good cause . T.J. , they 're all looking for Damon . Even Superboy . He was hoping you could help . I can . Um , those guys who jumped us , they tried to act like cops but , I mean , they missed by a mile . They had shoulder patches .. Irongate Protective Services . [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] Damon , ha . You and I have a lot in common . That 's a disgusting thought . I sure couldn 't do it , Mr. Manfred . I 'd be awake all night , unable to sleep . Remembering all those hungry faces staring at me . But after all , business is business . Look at you , a beach bum . What do you know about business ? I have my MBA from the University of California . I 've been vice president of three different corporations . Do you want me to go on ? - I caught her snooping . - Damon ! Miss Political Science . Put her in the back office . Don 't let her get away ! [ Lana screams ] Ten thousand dollars tax-free and it 's yours . Just move your people away from my area . No deal . You know why I dropped out ? Too many of your kind . All the lying and cheating and ruthlessness . But when it 's called business , it 's perfectly acceptable . [ chuckling ] I tried , Damon . I tried . But you gave me no choice . And now the little lady has to go with you . Okay . I rethought the deal . You let Lana go , we 'll do business . [ whooshing ] I 'm rethinking it too , Damon . Once the girl is away free .. ... your self-righteous morality will insist that you keep your people where they are . Without you , they 'll drift away and it won 't cost me one cent . [ shrill squeal ] I 'm sorry I got you into this . Forgive me . I got myself into it . [ guns cocking ] [ crashing ] ( both ) Ah ! - Are you okay , Lana ? - I am now . - Let 's talk deal . - Anything . Anything . - The factory , open it ! - He broke the law . I have to turn him over to the police . Suppose I don 't press charges ? Please , I 'll do anything you want . You 'll give jobs to the people you promised ? Agreed ! Why would anybody trust him to keep his word ? If he doesn 't , we 'll have to tell the authorities about his attempted murder of you and Damon . You two will be more than happy to testify against Mr. Manfred in order to plea bargain for lesser offence . You won 't have to worry about your neighbors . The state will provide you with a place to live , called prison . If that thought doesn 't keep you honest I 'll be back to ask you why . While you 're waiting for jobs , our good and faithful friend Mr. Gerald Manfred will provide you with housing . [ cheering ] - Bye-bye . Take care . - Bye-bye . Bye-bye . Take care of yourself . ( all ) Bye . - Goodbye , Alice . - What about you ? - Is there a job for you ? - That 's not my style . I 've got some other things to do . Goodbye , sweetheart . Oh , for me ? Thank you . Remember me . I wanna thank you . Don 't thank me . Thank T.J. and Lana . - I-I didn 't do anything . - That 's not true , Clark . You took the first step of the solution to the problem of the homeless . What 's that ? You noticed that we exist . Take care . Bye-bye , pretty lady . - Take care of yourself . - Thank you . Yeah . [ pleasant music ] Ha . Jane , I know you like it a lot here at the beach . You 're gonna like it a lot more starting today . Your mom 's got a great job . Oh . You got a new place to live .

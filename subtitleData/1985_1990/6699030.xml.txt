Woman : that was the climactic moment last night at the little miss havana pageant as gloria sanchez won the crown . And with election day only 4 weeks away , it was no surprise to see our very own handsome congressman steve marcus getting acquainted with some of his voters . Congressman marcus faces a tough fight in one of the most closely contested races in southern florida . The beauty contest , hosted by the council de cubanos americanos , attracted an enthusiastic crowd . Festivities lasted all night with dancing till dawn . [ Whistles ] [ whistles ] frankie ! [ Whistles ] ohh ... [ knocking on door ] man : it 's me ! Come on , frankie ! Open up ! Frankie , i 'm sorry . I know i 'm a little late , but , you know , i was working . You shoulda seen me .

Breakfast as usual , andget me a cosmopolitan , a glamour , a new woman , complete woman , working woman , and modern wrestler . You got it . I 'm in a hurry , so just send them up , ok ? Morning , bruce . Morning . Meyerholtz group is still waiting on the promo copy . Giraldi likes the slogan , but he wants to delete the word " small . " He thinks it 's a turnoff . Ok , change it from " small enough to hold " to " big enough to grab on to . " Frankie- - and dr . Ramdas and the n.a.s.a. people are offering you a rush job on some project of theirs . They 're waiting for you in conference room b . Excuse me , bruce , i have the floor . Frankie , i didn 't think that we were taking on any new clients until after the marcus campaign . Thanks , suzy , but we just finished . We did ? By the way , folks , we 're dropping congressman marcus . We are ? But why ? I don 't understand . Suzy , just burn the file and bill him , ok ? And your mother called at 8 : 45 , 9 : 00 , 9 : 15- - something about have you decided on the lime green bows or the passion pink rhinestones for your shoes for your sister 's wedding ? Oh , god ! Tell her i 'm coming barefoot- - in black . [ Chuckles ] oh , wait . Hold ? Smile ... perfect . Sorry , gentlemen , to keep you waiting . I 'm always late , but i 'm worth it . Ok , boys . Let 's see what you 've got . [ Music playing ] man : chemtec gives us america 's future today , bringing space inside the american home . And now it is developing its most extraordinary creation yet , the ulysses android , destined to revolutionize the american way of life . Developed here at chemtec laboratory under my direct supervision , ulysses is the closest thing to man himself . The future applications for such an android are virtually infinite : handling hazardous chemicals , detecting radiation , disarming explosives , fighting fires , test-piloting new aircrafts , and , of course , exploring space . The awesome distances , prolonged periods of time , and tortuous confinement have made deep space exploration problematic for the human pilot . We believe the ulysses android is the answer . Ok , i think i 've seen enough . Bruce ? What do you think ? Well , it 's not gonna win any oscars . And what 's more important , we 're losing our funding in congress . That 's why we came here . We need to make people see how important this project is . Miss stone ... the ulysses android is an amazing piece of equipment . Yeah , but ... i 'm not used to promoting hardware , doctor . I promote people . Politicians , businessmen , the occasional rock star . Dr. Ramdas ... do you know who controls most of america 's tv dials and buys 72 % of all magazines ? Women . And if this publicity campaign is gonna work , that , gentlemen , is your target group . This sounds like something you could do in , say , 35 days ? Only if i can publicize the android my way , and that means full media saturation . And i promise you , boys , i 'll have everyone in congress itching to fund your program before you can say e.t. welcome to chemtec . Parking in lot c . Thanks . Welcome to chemtec , miss stone . Oh , dr . Ramdas , it 's a pleasure . Quite a facility you 've got . Well , thank you . It 's the way of the future . Your visitor 's pass . Would you follow me , please ? Sure . P.a. : paging dr . Nipatoe . Dr. Nipatoe to robotics , room d , please . Dr. Nipatoe ... this is where ulysses was born . In the future , making love will no longer be necessary for the creation of life . It can all be done far more efficiently in the lab . How romantic . Of course , i myself prefer the old-fashioned way . Why don 't you wait in here ? I 'll see if dr . Peters is free . I know he 'd like to meet you . Okey-dokey . Oh ! Oh , hi , you must be dr . Peters . I 'm frankie stone . What do you call these ? What ? Oh--wh- - what are you- - you 've been in this lab too long , buddy ! P.a. : paging dr . Stevenson . You 're wanted in image processing , dr . Peterberg . Oh , my god ! I knew it ! One minute with a woman and he short-circuits . My god , he looks like you ! What did you think he 'd look like , an erector set ? What 's the matter , no man ever lose his head over you before ? [ Snorts ] he looks so real . He--he- - he is real ... in his own way . Metal , proteins , synthetic fibers . He 's no different than you or i . What 's that ? That--i-i- - is his reset button . It reactivates his motor control . I told ramdas that the concept of a woman would merely confuse him . Ulysses , stop playing games . Ulysse- - ulysses ! Here . Oh--uh ! [ Beep beep ] dr . Ramdas : i thought showing you these tapes might help to make you more familiar with the droid . You see , miss stone , programming the android takes him just so far . The rest must be learned like a human child . We had some difficulty with his gross motor functions before we modified his cerebral muscular coordination . [ Frankie giggles ] dr . Peters , severely : edge perception , miss stone , is extremely difficult . [ Giggles ] dr . Peters : it--it may look simple to you , but it really is an incredibly sophisticated series of programs . Dr. Peters : once we were able to modify his hand / eye coordination , we--we realized he had a retinal resolution 10 times greater than that of the average human eye . Dr. Peters : and as you can see , we licked that problem . Frankie : well , if all else fails , he can always take your place on jury duty . Men : * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday , dear ulysses * * happy birthday to you * [ all cheering ] ahem . Dr. Peters , he really is an amazing creation , but i think that we might wanna take some time to polish up his social graces . Social graces ? What for ? Jeff , i 've gotta agree with miss stone . I think a woman would be a good influence on him . Trish ? Hi ! What are you doing here ? Ivy 's wedding isn 't until next week . [ Dog whimpering ] oh , trish ... i can 't believe donald would do this to you ! Yeah , my mother was right . I should never have married an actor . Ohh ... what 's going on ? Are you having a garage sale ? Oh , you might call it that . I 'm changing my life , getting rid of the garbage . Oh , no ! Steve , too ? Mm-hmm . Jesus , frankie , i always thought steve was about the best you were gonna do . But it 's nice to know i 'm not the only one who 's been dragged through the mud by some macho scum . [ Dog barks ] snowball ! Trish , it wasn 't exactly like that . You know , frankie , being single again could be really great . I mean , you could go wherever you wanted , sleep with whoever you wanted , have absolutely incredible sex with strangers . Like , um ... i 've never made it with a bodybuilder , have you ? Or an acrobat ? [ Laughing ] how about a car mechanic ? A sweaty one . [ Laughs ] i 've never even tried a m age à trois , have you ? With steve ? Mm-hmm . Oh , god , it was hard enough to get him alone . Oh . And even then it wasn 't hard enough . [ Both laughing ] well , frankie , when you think about it ... there are a lot of possibilities . Frankie : ok ... that 's the first problem . You 've got nice eyes , ulysses , now use them . Look at me . Why ? I know you 're there . Because looking someone in the eyes makes them feel that you care about what they 're saying . That 's point number one : make eye contact . And point number 2 is listening . Now , you look at a woman , or anyone , for that matter , and listen- - as if what they 're saying is the most important thing in the entire world . Good . Good . Now , point number 3 : confidence . [ Intercom buzzes ] just stay there . Stay ... stay . [ Buzz ] yeah ? Woman : steve marcus is here to see you . Ok , uh , just hold him there , would you ? I 'll be right up . Ulysses , why don 't you watch this for a little while , ok ? They have nobody . Phil donahue : you also are , like- - i 'm very pleased that you would be- - oh ! Here . Here . This is a talk show . Now , you 're gonna be on one of these in a couple of weeks , so i want you to study , okey-dokey ? Okey-dokey . How ' bout , should you marry , what about children ... i 'll be right back . Biological clock , all that stuff ? Yes , my biologic clock is counting down , and , um , i would like to have children . And , uh , right now , i just try to psych myself out of not having children because i don 't think they 're in my future . Um , are you looking for mr . Right ? Yes . Yes , but- - isn 't that a trap ? Is there such a person ? P.a. : attention , welding teams c and d ... hi . Please report to annex b on c level . [ Whispering ] what are you doing here ? I have to talk to you ! You won 't return my phone ca- - shh ! My phone calls ! Here . What happened to your lip ? It 's a mustache . I felt that it would make me look more mature . Voters like that . Well , i 'm a voter , steve . You don 't like it ? ! Shh ! Why are you here ? Is there someplace a little more private where we can talk ? Yeah , sure . I 'll walk you to your car . One of the things is that you can 't sit around on your hoopey-doopey waiting for mr . Right to come ! Woman : she 's not doing that . Man : yeah , i know , but you 've gotta get out there , and you 've gotta let yourself be known . You 've gotta say , " here i am , and i 'm worthwhile . " I think a lot of that depends on your own image of your self . If you sit home and turn on the television set , don 't expect anything to happen ! Get out there and say , " look at me ! I 'm gorgeous ! " Donahue : but the problem is , there aren 't that many other gorgeous , wonderful people out there ! That 's the problem ! Man : well , you know , i don 't- - woman : there are- - there are a lot- - man : i don 't believe it ! I think there are ! Donahue : all right . Are the--what 's the matter ? Yes , ma 'am , would you kindly stand ? Second woman : yes , i am a widow . I 've been a widow for 5 years . And i 've found out the best way ... [ blows air ] ... and do something for somebody . [ Applause ] donahue : and we 'll be back in just a moment . [ Donahue theme playing ] man : aren 't you tired of politicians who don 't give a damn about what you think ? We are . Who are we ? We 're voters for steven marcus , believers in a better congress with better congressmen . What makes marcus so much better than even the so-called " best " ? He 's sensitive to your needs . I really believe he cares . He 's smart as a whip . He stands for the issues that really matter . Una persona sincera . I think he 's just like you and me , except he 's a little better . Man : steven marcus . It takes a man this sensitive to know your needs . Paid for by citizens for marcus . [ Donahue theme starts ] donahue : here 's the point . If you 're looking for mr . Right , then your well-being is determined by ... what are you doi- - it takes a man thissensitive to know your needs . My god , that w-woman is turning you into a hooker ! Woman : i think that i have a hope that there is a mr . Right out there for me . How you doin ' , skippy ? Is that your new campaign manager ? [ Laughs ] that 's very funny . Come on , frankie . [ Sighs ] i need you back on board . Skipper ? Take a break . You know , i 've , uh ... i 've really missed you . [ Laughs ] i 'm desperate . I fell three points in the polls . My entire career is on the line ! Ok , call the office . Maybe we can recommend somebody . I already have . I mean , i 'm considering , uh- - i 'm considering hiring suzy duncan . You mean my assistant suzy duncan ? Well , why not ? She 's had some good ideas so far . Look , frankie ! Look , you come back ! We can keep it strictly professional . I mean , we can , uh- - we could even date other people ! I mean , i thought that 's what you 'd want ! Isn 't it ? Are you dating other people ? Well , yeah , i mean , you know , kind of . Aren 't you ? Yeah , sure . Yeah . Yeah . Jesus , that was damn quick work ! We only broke up last tuesday ! What , you keep this guy on a back burner or something ? Steve ! Well , it got serious pretty goddamned quick ! Look , i don 't have time to get into this right now . I 've gotta go back to work . It 's somebody you work with , right ? See , you never were very good at separating business from pleasure ! I need to speak with you right now . Jeff ! Look , don 't- - don 't get upset . There 's nothing to be jealous about . I 'm not jealous ! Uh , steve marcus . Jeff peters . Dr. Jeff peters . Well , i hope you 're registered , jeff , because i 'm gonna be needing you out there 4 weeks from tuesday . I don 't follow politics . [ Chuckles ] sorry , steve . Take good care of him , skippy . Ok ? Bye bye . What are you doing ? [ Whispering ] shh ! You 're my new boyfriend . Miss stone , if i have unwittingly led you on , i sincerely apologize . Don 't flatter yourself . I hate men . [ Woman mis-speaking spanish ] ivy , must you babble like that ? You are going to shave those before the wedding ? Hector likes me like this . Shaving 's such a bourgeois concept , mom . Marriage is a bourgeois concept , ivy . How come i can 't talk you out of that ? Sorry i 'm late ! Well , you two look adorable . Who 's getting married here , huh ? The wrong person . You could have married the most eligible bachelor in all of miami if you 'd played your cards right , and your sister here insists on marrying a busboy . Hector and i are in love , mom ! What 's love got to do with it ? Frankie and steve had a relationship . It didn 't work out . Did they have to go through a horrendous divorce like me ? No , they were sensible . They parted as friends . If i never see him again , it will be a day too soon . How about a week from saturday , frankie ? It 's bad enough you asked that creep to the wedding , but , mother , asking steve to give ivy away ! I certainly did not invite him ! He called ivy , didn 't he , ivy ? You asked him . No , i didn 't ! It was his idea . Well , he said you wouldn 't mind , frankie . Oh , i don 't mind . I just won 't come . No problem ! We 'll call off the wedding ! I 'm happy to lose my deposit ! I 'm getting married , mother ! So , you 're really not gonna come , frankie ? Of course i 'll be there . I 'm a big girl . I 'll come . It 's no big deal . Oh , you 're amazing , frankie . I knew you 'd understand . Mother : bye , ivy ! Woman : oh , ho ho ! Bullshit , donny ! Stop seeing that no-good slut ! * Doo doo doo doo roast beef and salami * [ woman and man yelling ] who are you ? Where 's trish ? Moe glickstein , don 's business manager . This is manny our accountant . Are you a friend of trish 's or something ? I happen to live here . Oh ! Oh , very nice place you 've got here ! Sit down , have a nosh . Manny , give her some of your corned beef . Why not ? I 'm not hungry . What 's going on ? My boy donny suddenly announces he 's losing his equilibrium . He can 't sleep , he can 't work . He needs his old lady back . Ah , he 's a meshugenuh ! Hey , you want a pickle ? Honey , you can 't go up there . Don and trish need their space ! Oh , you 've gotta be kidding me . Honey , calm down ! Here 's $ 20 . I can get you in to tiny tim at the eden roc . It 's a terrific show . What do you say , huh ? Trish : bullshit , donny ! Ohh ! Oh , ulysses , what are you doing here ? Standing . That 's what i do at night . That 's it ? You don 't ... read or watch television or multiply 6-digit numbers ? No . Ulysses , why are you staring at me like that ? Because you taught me to and because i think you 're attractive . I think you 're the most attractive woman i know . I 'm the only woman you know . But thanks , ulysses . That 's nice . You 're welcome . Frankie , what are you doing here ? Good question . Ohh , i 'm tired , and i guess i didn 't know where else to go . Jeff taught me to massage the body part when i have a spasm in my mechanism . Uh ... [ cracking ] [ chuckling ] oh . Hee hee hee ! Um ... you know , ulysses , you can 't just go grabbing people 's feet like that . Why not ? Well , because it just isn 't done . Why ? Well , um ... you see , there are--are rules for social behavior , and , um ... well ... relationships between people develop in stages , and ... to get physical with someone , you have to get to know them first . Now , if you don 't mind , i 've had a very long day , and i 'd like to get some sleep . Good night , ulysses . Good night . Good night . What was that ? A kiss . People kiss when they like each other . It 's a sign of love or affection . Although in my case , maybe i 'm going nuts . Now , ulysses , if you don 't mind , could you just stand out here in the hallway , please ? Sweet dreams . Sweet dreams . [ Smack ] jeff ! Jeff ! Excuse me . Sure . Guess you didn 't see me back there , huh ? Hello , sandra . I told you to call me sandy ! We 're still friends , aren 't we ? I take the blame for everything that happened the other night , but , you know what they say , getting started 's the hardest part . Look , i 've got a lot of work to do . And i 'm the carefree type , no pressures , no demands , anything for a laugh . We 're still on for tonight , aren 't we ? Y-y-yeah . Yeah . I--i guess so . Ok ! Great ! So ... it 's a date ! [ Giggles ] oh , excuse me . Ow ! Damn ! P.a. : all those wishing to participate in dr . Niederhol 's single interface are to meet in artificial intelligence , room b , promptly at 6 : 00 . I love you , jeff . [ Smack ] oh , my god ! What is that woman teaching you ? Dr. Peters : she is cluttering his progress with useless nonsense , monopolizing very valuable training time with god knows what . But--wha--b--e- - emotional tics that i have worked to get out of my own personality , she has managed to drum into him overnight ! This morning , ulysses met me in- - in that hall , and he kissed me ... right near my mouth . I guess he likes you , jeff . Um , very funny . Miss stone ? I am not amused . Ulysses is going into deep space . He is going to be alone for 7 years . He is not going out to discotheques . All right . All right . Jeff ... if you feel you need more time with ulysses- - yes , i do ! I 'm sure miss stone can reschedule . And , miss stone , please , try to stick to the essentials . Ok . Oh , and , jeff ... now that ulysses is acting more human , perhaps he could give you a few lessons . [ Door slams ] bruce : well , i 'm still waiting to hear from good morning , america and live at 5 : 00 , butthe only confirmation i haveso far is from eye on miami . Jesus , bruce , can 't we get anything national ? Well , the dr . Ruth people aren 't sure . They wanna know if ... if he has a , uh- - a penis . Forget it . Try the carson people . Ok . P.a. : paging dr . Nipatoe . Dr. Nipatoe , your pizza is here . Oh , wait ! Wait ! Shit ! Woman : yes ? All right . Yes , sure . Good night , dr . Peters . Is everything all right ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . * ... can 't see me loving nobody but you * * for all my life * miss stone ? Please . * ... you 're with me * * baby , the skies will be blue * * for all my life * dr . Ramdas ? Eh , you know , dr . Peters can get a little excited sometimes . Yes , i 've noticed . Ulysses is a very expensive piece of equipment , but i want you to know that i have complete faith in you . I know you 'd never do anything to jeopardize this project . Thanks , dr . Ramdas . Nice wheels . * ... all my life * * when you 're with me , baby , the skies ... * [ engine roars ] * ... me and you and you and me * * no matter how they toss the dice * * it had to be * * the only one for me is you and you for me * * so happy together * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * me and you and you and me * * no matter how they toss the dice * * it had to be * * the only one for me is you and you for me * * so happy together * * so happy together * * ooh ooh ooh ooh * * how is the- - * aah ! Oh , god ! This is great ! What are you doing there ? But jeff never told me it would be like this ! Oh , my god ! Frankie : ulysses ! Get in the car ! Frankie : ulysses ! I could go to prison for this ! Ulysses , get back here right now ! You 're making me very angry ! Ohh ! Oh , pardon me . Dr. Peters ? Is that you ? What are you doing down there ? Steve . Steve marcus . We met once before , remember ? It takes a man this sensitive to know your needs . Well , yes . That 's the , uh- - that 's the campaign slogan . But , uh , what really concerns me- - sir . Sir . See you out there- - what really concerns me , of course , are the issues . Ulysses--steve ! Hi ! What a surprise ! Steve , there 's a b-a-b-y over there . I think you should- - ahem . Frankie ! Well , suzy ! You know , i love the hair , the mustache , the whole new look . Suzy : really ? You know , uh , frankie , i 'm super sorry that i didn 't call you , but after all , this is my big shot , you know ? Well ... not all that large , suz . But i 'm happy for you , really . I wish you all the success you deserve . Well , off we go . Right , jeff ? Bye bye ! See you at the wedding ! What 's a wedding ? Man on tv : joker ... joker ... hey ! [ Applause and cheering ] so , what can i help you with ? I 'm going to a wedding . No , you 're not . I 'm sorry , sir . We 're just looking . A wedding ! Mazel tov ! You 've come to the right place . So , you seem like the kind of guy who 's ready to take a fashion chance . I 've got something , it 's gonna knock your socks off . I don 't wear socks . Ha ha ha ! Right . Ha ha ha ! So what are you ? A 38 ? 40 ? Huh ? Oh , here we are ! Try this on , my friend . Um ... ulysses , don 't waste this nice man 's time . Now , take it off . I like it , frankie . He likes it , frankie . You don 't like it , frankie ? No . You prefer something more conservative ? No problem . How about your basic black , huh ? Half-price- - no . Because i 'm a nice guy , i 'll even throw in some shoes . So listen , when 's the affair ? Ulysses : frankie ? What do i do now ? Put on the jacket and the pants . Frankie : no . Take the jumpsuit off first . Is it congenital or contagious ? Drugs . Uh-huh . Now what do i do ? Oh , my god ! Is there something wrong ? Nothing a rabbi couldn 't fix . Salesman : take a look at this guy , huh ? Now , that 's what we call pizzazz ! Think about it while i write up the bill . Frankie , do i look bad ? No , you look great . Um , look , ulysses , i didn 't mean to embarrass you back there , it 's just that ... well , i 've always thought of you as a child , if you know what i mean . Yes . Yes . Um ... uh , what i 'm trying to say is , um ... well , see i--i just don 't understand why jeff felt it was necessary to give you that , um ... thing . Jeff felt it would give me confidence . Salesman : ok , i 'm gonna throw in some shorts . Oh ... ok ! With the shoes and the cumberbund , that comes to $ 294.98 with the tax . We accept cash , credit cards . Would you prefer our convenient layaway loan program ? Oh , no , no . [ Alarm beeping ] he just wanted to try one on . It was just kind of a joke . Electronic voice : we 're sorry , but we failed to remove the inventory control- - ulysses ! Uh ... we accept all major credit cards . Howdy , pardner ! Come on down to big bob 's end-of-the-year stereo r-r-roundup . Howdy , pardner ! " Howdy . " Everything in our corral must go ! T-t-tvs ! Vcrs ! Microwaves ! You name it , we got it ! Howdy , pardner ! Come on down to big bob 's ... sandy : jeff . Jeff ! Hi ! It 's me ! Hi ! Howdy , pardner . Ha ha ha ! Howdy ! That 's funny , us bumping into each other like this , huh ? Small world ! Yes , it is . The earth is the fifth largest planet in the solar system , its diameter being 7,918 miles . Hey , you look great ! You got a tuxedo on and everything . I hope you didn 't do that just for me . Although i 'd really be flattered if you did . We 're still on for tonight , aren 't we ? 'Cause i had a great time the other night , and i was just thinking that you were just beginning to like me , although i don 't wanna pressure you at all . What is your name ? Sandy ! Ha ha ha ! You got a short memory ! Live for the moment , right ? Ha ha ha ! Hey ! I just had a crazy idea . What if , instead of going out tonight , we just went out right now , just- - ha ha ha ! I don 't know , what would you think ? Okey-dokey . Well , great ! You 're really in a good mood ! So , i 'll just go change . I got a new designer outfit , and i 'll be right back . Don 't go away ! Ha ha ha ! Hey ... [ laughing ] does it seem like people are staring at us ? We must look pretty great together ! Oh , god , if i felt this good all the time , i wouldn 't be back in therapy . You know what i mean ? No , i don 't , sandy . Ohh ! Look at those earrings ! I 've been dreaming about those ever since july ! Would you like them ? You think i was hinting . I was just daydreaming ! They 're too expensive . No ! No ! Oh ! Salesman : a wonderful choice . Those are japanese cultured pearls in a very handsome setting . Jeff , no , really . I can 't . I- - [ giggles ] this is so embarrassing ! They 'll look lovely on you , miss . Thank you , jeff . I have a confession to make . I 'm really just an old-fashioned girl and ... getting a gift from a man really means a lot to me . Yes . That 'll be $ 139.56 with the tax . Would you like to pay with credit card , cash , or check ? Sir ? Sir ? Jeff , the money . I don 't have any . Huh ? [ Chuckles ] that 's ok ! I don 't mind , really . I- - they 're just so beautiful . You take american express ? What an amazing concept ! You don 't have a credit card ? Jeff , you 're really a lot different than i thought you were . [ Laughs ] trish ! Thank god you 're there ! Look , i 'm with my cousin- - actually , i 'm not with him , but i should be . Yes , i have a cousin . He 's in for the wedding . Who cares if he 's cute ? ! Look , if by any chance he shows up there , just keep him there , would you ? I 'll be at the lab . I can 't explain ! Just do it ! [ Tires squeal ] here you go . You certainly have quite an appetite . Yes . I never get food with so many colors . What do you usually eat , jeff ? Phenodyethemine in an amino acid base . Guess that means you don 't cook , huh ? Ow ! Jeez ! Well , i think i 've had about enough fun for one night . My cash is gone , and my credit card 's getting a little thin . Why don 't we just go home ? Could you take me ? You don 't have your car ! No . Ok ! Where do you wanna go ? Frankie stone 's ? You 'll like her ! Oh , no , i won 't ! [ Pschht pschht ] [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] hello ? No . No . Mrs. Stone is- - miss stone is not here right now . All right . [ Musical notes ring ] oh , thank god you 're here ! Miss stone , my god ! Jeff ! Haven 't you ascertained by now that i have no desire in pursuing intimate relations with you ? ! Sorry , jeff . Sorry . [ Sobbing ] * this magic moment * * so different and so new * * will last forever ... * where is he ? Oh , frankie ! He must have broken his neck . What ? He just flew out of control ! And he jerked forward ! It was terrible ! Wait ! Where is he ? [ Sobbing ] aah ! [ Barks ] frankie : trish ! He was so giving , so compassionate . He had such a wonderful understanding of a woman 's heart and now he 's dead ! Trish , trish , calm down ! Now , what happened ? I couldn 't help it . It was the way he looked at me . He was so beautiful , and all of a sudden we were in each other 's arms , and we were making love , and it was so- - wait a minute ! You were making what ? ! We were making love , and it was the most beautiful thing i have ever felt in my entire life ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! He could do that ? With you ? Why shouldn 't he do that with me ? Oh , trish ! Damn it ! Did you show him how ? This is getting a little sick , don 't you think ? Your cousin is dead on the kitchen floor ! He was on top of me , inside me , and then he just started going crazy ! His head started twisting off , and he died ! [ Sobbing ] trish ... trish , just help me get his head off , would you ? Ohh ! My god ! What are you talking about ? ! Listen ! I 'm sorry to have to tell you this , but you didn 't make love to my cousin . You just made it with my android ! [ Dog whimpers ] your what ? Ewwh ! [ Sobbing ] ewwh ! What are you so happy about ? It 's so beautiful out here , frankie . You know , i 'm really enjoying our date . Let 's get one thing straight , ulysses . This is not a date , ok ? Is that because you 're uptight ? No , i am not uptight ! And who taught you that stupid word ? Trish . That figures . Look , ulysses , i 'm just a little upset right now , ok ? It 's 3 : 00 in the morning , i 'm tired , i haven 't changed clothes for two days , and you 've probably just cost me my job . I 'm sorry , frankie . [ Chuckles ] i mean , what a joke ! Me , trying to turn you into somebody that everybody in america 's supposed to fall in love with . Frankie ? Why do people want to fall in love ? I don 't know , ulysses . You 're asking the wrong girl . Don 't you want to fall in love ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? But , believe me , it 's not that easy . You fall in love with some guy , but he 's in love with somebody else . Or you think you 're in love , but you 're not . Or he thinks he 's in love , but he 's not . Or he was in love , but now he 's not , but now you are . You make it sound so complicated . It is complicated . And , ulysses , you should be glad that you 're not human and you don 't have to suffer through that kind of humiliation . If i were human , frankie , it would be simple . I would be in love with you . You know , frankie , i thought last night was a lot of fun , but i think tonight was even better . I 'm glad you had fun . I certainly did . Good . Now i want you to go in there and change back into your jumpsuit , and please , ulysses , don 't say a word about this evening to anyone , ok ? Ok . Ok , good . Good night . Can i keep my tuxedo ? Ok . For now . Does that mean i can go to a wedding ? I 'm sorry , ulysses . Just go change , ok ? Good night . [ Beeping ] ulysses : jeff ? What ? Let 's say there 's this certain person that you really like , but then you have sex with someone else . Now ... a : do you have to like the person you have sex with ? B : do you have to have sex with the person you like ? C : do you have to stop liking the person you like ? " D " - - d ... none of the above . I 'm going to have to change your program . But , jeff , what about babies ? Can i have one ? It is that woman , isn 't it ? What has she been teaching you ? ! She 's teaching me about life , jeff , and it 's very interesting , but what i really need to know is , are love and sex the same thing ? Look , ulysses , i want you to remember that you are much more advanced than that woman will ever be . Do not let her drag you down to her level ! She lives in an emotional swamp ! But then , so do most people ! Some minor activity occurs in the medulla , and--and wham ! They think they 're in love . The next thing they know , they have 2 children and a canine . And then , boom ! Some neuron misfires , and they 're divorced , miserable , and only get to see their children on sundays . It is all chemical , ulysses , and it is all a waste of time . You were made for grander things , pal . Do you read me ? Loud and clear , jeff . Good , ulysses . Good . Jeff ? Do you think miss stone has sex appeal ? I do . But steve 's mother said steve said you had a date for the wedding , dear . Frankie : i don 't know what steve 's talking about . Well , according to steve 's mother , he 's not much to look at , but ... i heard he was some sort of doctor . We 're all dying to meet him . Mom , look , i told you i 'm coming alone ! Now , darling , you are gonna be able to dig up somebody , aren 't you ? Now , you don 't want steve to see you there all alone , do you , dear ? Mom , thanks for the advice . I 've gotta go . Look , i 'll call you when i get home , ok ? Bye . Ohh ! Dr. Peters ? Hi . How did work go today ? Fine . Just ... great . Oh , good . Ahem . Jeff , um ... i--i don 't want to scare you , understand that , ok ? But could i ask you something ? Ok . Um ... well , for , uh , reasons i can 't go into and you don 't wanna know about , i have to go to this ... wedding , and i need a date , and you 'd be the exact perfect guy . Now , this isn 't a proposition . I just wanna know if you might think about ... maybe going with me ? A wedding ? Um , i don 't know . I 'm not very good with people . Oh , they 're not people ! They 're just my family . You know , jeff , you 've got really nice eyes . Have you ever considered maybe wearing contacts ? Good night . Frankie : you can pick me up at 4 : 00 at 1313 southeast 10th street , miami beach . Ok ? Thanks so much , jeff . I really appreciate this . Oh , hello . Sandra , i 'm--i 'm sorry about last night . I wasn 't feeling well . Ahem . Shouldn 't you be having your lunch now ? I 'm not hungry . [ Gasp ] frankie ! Frankie , come here ! Frankie ! What ? What is it ? That 's her ! That 's the slut that stole donald . I know nothing of the kind . Look me in the eye and say that . Do you want me to list the things we 've done together ? Oh ... shut up . Oh , my god , they 're frenching ! This is network tv , and they 're using tongues ! That 's got to be against some rule ! Oh , no . No , i can 't . Please stop ! Alessandro , i 'm pregnant . Trish : it better not be donald 's . Is this some trick of yours ? What ? If it is , i 'll slap you . Oh , go ahead and hit me . Do you think that i have any pride left ? Oh ! Mmm ! Oh . Oh , i love you ... and i hate you ! [ Melodramatic music ] i love you , and i hate you , too . Oh ! New jersey . It 's not just a state . It 's a state of mind . Huh ... if we ever get back together , i 'm going to hold this against him forever . Look , trish , don 't use that vcr , ok ? I told you , i 'm sending all of this stuff back tomorrow . Oh , god ! I don 't see why ulysses bought you all this stuff anyone . I 'm the one who slept with him , for christ 's sake . It 's bad enough to be dumped by donald but to be jilted by an android ! Ulysses just thinks i 'm mad at him , and this is his way of apologizing . Hmm . But still ... why 12 pairs of the same shoe ? Because he didn 't know your shoe size . He 's so sweet . Mind if i borrow the size 8 ? Hey , frankie , how do you think he manages to buy all this stuff ? [ Knock knock ] hey , it looks like prom night out here . Come on in . You 're looking spiffy . Hey , trish ! Our escort 's here . Oh . Well , thanks , jeff . It 's , uh ... oh , a wrist corsage . Very cute . Ah ! Oh , my god ! I can 't believe they look exactly alike ! I know . I wonder if everything else is the same . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! [ Wedding march plays ] what a wonderful reaffirmation of life . Please , steve , cut the crap . Dearly beloved ... [ speaking spanish ] we are gathered here today ... [ speaking spanish ] [ camera shutter clicks ] that 's nice . That 's beautiful . Oh , that 's very romantic . That 's nice . Hold that . Very nice . More romance . Oh , that 's very good . Hold that . Very nice . [ Car radio ] * rock steady , baby * * that 's what i feel now * * that 's all the song ... * [ honk honk ] hey , dude , are you all right ? I 'm going to a wedding . * Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride ... * that 's way the hell in miami beach , my man . Are you going way the hell in miami beach , my man ? Come on . Hop on in . [ Band playing ] [ applause ] [ speaking spanish ] and now we 'd like to call our beautiful bride to join her handsome esposo for tonight 's first dance . 1 , 2 , 3 . [ Music playing ] ooh ! Whoo ! You can take the little umbrella out , jeff . It 's allowed . How 'd you like to dance ? I 'm ... i 'm not very good at it . Oh , come on , it 's easy . I 'll lead . Hi , hi , hi ! Steve , i 'd like you to meet two superfabulous people , essie and ramon hernandez . ¿ Como esta ? Essie and ramon are real interested in nicaragua and all the issues and things . And i know they 'd like to hear about our special bingo fund-raiser . Uno momento . Back in a jiffy . Why don 't you take some time off , suzy ? We 're at a wedding ! I 'm doing it for you , honey . I can 't believe you . You 're worse than i am . Hasta luego . Hasta luego . Thanks . Hi . So ... mind if i cut in ? This is our song . I think that would be a good idea . I didn 't know babaloo was our song , steve . Frankie , you 're really exciting me in that dress . Listen , what 's the matter ? It 's a little difficult to take you seriously with that ridiculous mustache , steve . Would you try ? I mean , i don 't tease you about yours . Sometimes i forget what a creep you are . Oh , come on , frankie . Won 't you give me a second chance ? I think i 'd like to marry you . Careful , steve . That almost sounded sincere . Are you in love with that doofus or what ? He happen to be one of the brightest men on this planet . Oh , i don 't doubt it . I 'll make you take me seriously . Stay right there . Don 't move . I 'll be back . Ooh ! What are you eating ? Protein paste . Don 't touch that , please . I developed it specifically for the ulysses project . One tube contains all the nutrients required for a four-week period . Oh . I 've been meaning to ask , this science thing that you do- - what exactly are you into ? Well ... ha ! [ Snorts ] i 'm " into " robotics and space exploration . Ooh . I had a dream about space the other day . I was , uh--hello ? Hello . I was traveling far , far out into another galaxy , and i had this strange sensation that space was folding in on itself , like it was curved or something . What ? Folding in on itself . That 's amazing . That 's what does happen ! Space is curved . Really ? Yes . You see ... if this is our galaxy and these represent other known galaxies- - is that a pimento ? Oh , i 'm sorry . Am i destroying distant worlds ? No . That 's ok . Now , that is a quasar , ok ? What 's that ? That ... that 's a black hole . Black hole ? Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Yes , sir ? Yes . Straight through to the back . As ... i was saying , you see , a black hole is so dense that its gravity actually sucks in light . Its gravity actually sucks in light . Mm-hmm . I still don 't understand . You 're driving me crazy ! I got to get her back , man . Donny , you got to make it up with your missus . We can 't schlep down to miami every time you can 't fall sleep at night ! New ? He 's got to get her back . He 's a meshugenuh ! [ Speaking yiddish ] oy yi yi yi . Oh , my god , it 's alessandro from new jersey ! Allesandro ! Aah ! Can i just touch your hair ? Don 't touch my hair , all right ? Just--just- - just don 't touch my hair . It 's gorgeous . Oh ! Manny , come on , man . Take care of this . Ooh ! Now can you take me seriously ? Here , take this . Come on , frankie . I want you back . It 's not just because of the election . It 's because i love you . What does albert einstein here want ? What is it , jeff ? I came to tell you something . Well , what is it ? Frankie , i love you . Shall we dance ? Oh ! I 'll be right back . This is insane . We 've got to get you back to the lab ! Why ? I came all this way to be with you . I love you . You love me . How could you love me ? Ah , excuse me . Excuse me . Donald ! Where the hell is she ? What are you doing here ? Where 's trish ? Trish ? Yeah . What do you know about trish , tough guy ? Trish really likes sex . Aah ! Donald , don 't hit him ! Hit me . You 're really sick . No , no ! Aah ! Get away ! Frankie , i 'm coming ! Freeze ! Oh ! Aah ! Oh ! Come on , buddy . It 's go time . Oh ... donald ! Aah ! Donald , stop it ! You 're a dead man ! I 'll kill you ! Aah ! I 'm gonna kill you ! Donald , stop it ! Stop it ! Ow ! [ Speaking spanish ] donald ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Feedback ] i 'll get you ! Aah ! Oh ! Aah ! What 's going on ? Whoa ! Aah ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Ulysses ! Oh , my god ! Oh , god ! Ulysses ! Is he dead ? Oh , god ! Oh , god ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Move ! Can you fix him ? Ooh ! Ooh ! [ Beep beep beep ] although some of the stories are slightly exaggerated , there 's no doubt that ulysses ' popularity is spreading across the country from miami to seattle . We 'll take a closer look at some of the reasons why . Coming up at 11 : 00 after new jersey . Stay tuned . Trish , what 's wrong with me ? Look , you 're having a nervous breakdown . I have those all the time . Just because everything of value in your life has been destroyed , so what ? There 's still food . New jersey continues . Oh , why are you watching this idiotic show ? Because don gets punched at least once every episode , and i like watching that . Admit it , trish . You still love the jerk . After what he did at the wedding , you must be joking . No ! Please . I thought he was having an affair with a tall gorgeous blonde . Oh , he always has time for a little something extra . Oh ! No , marissa . No ! You see , isn 't this fun ? Yeah , he is kind of cute when he begs . You know you 're the only one i love . You couldn 't live without me . Kill him . Why ? Because you 're weak . [ Gunshot ] aah ! Oh , my god ! She 's killing him ! Don 't worry , nobody ever dies on these shows . [ Panting ] he 's dead ! Unless they 're canceling his contract . Ohh ! Deader than a door nail . Oh , no ! It 's got to be a mistake ! He 's supposed to be a regular ! 10 years as a starving actor . They can 't kill him after 12 episodes ! It 's not fair ! Trish , it 's not your problem anymore . He must be devastated . Why didn 't he call me ? Trish , think a minute ! Think how he treated you . Listen , donald is not perfect , i 'm not perfect , neither is steven neither are you ! What are you saying ? Look ... i don 't know ! Maybe you should go back with steve . Look , he 's handsome and he 's funny ... well , maybe he 's not all that funny , but he has an interesting job , and he earns his keep . Look , i don 't even like him that much , but it 's better than nothing . I 'll just go call from the other room . Come on , snowball . [ Ruff ruff ] ulysses , you 're not concentrating . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . I keep thinking about frankie . I miss her , jeff . I think i 'm in love . No , you 're not . You were never programmed to be in love , therefore , you can 't be in love . Ulysses , i won 't allow you to screw up 10 years of research and hard work because you 're mooning over some female . I 'm just not that interested in space anymore , jeff . Don 't say that ! Please ! This has been a dream of mine ever since i was a little boy , and you 're going to make it come true for me . Ulysses , you have a great future in space . You 'll go down in the history books . You 're to be envied . I don 't want to be envied . I want to be loved . Jeff , i love frankie . She is a person , and you are an android ! What happened between you was ridiculous ! Ridiculous , and she knows it . She thought it was ridiculous ? Yes , ulysses . I promise you once you 're up there you 'll feel completely different , because what you 'll be doing is truly the most exciting thing in the world . [ Click ] deejay : 97 gtr . Good morning , south florida ! What do you say , guys ? You 're on your way with the bearman this morning . It is 7 : 20 . It is going to be sunny and warm again today in south florida . Great day to go out to the beaches and work on your tan . Let 's talk a little bit about ulysses . We 've heard about him a lot lately . What do you think of ulysses ? Why don 't you call me now ? All the lines are open in dade , broward and the palm beaches , but first , coming up , a song ulysses might like , pink floyd 's welcome to the machine . 97 gtr . The best rock ' n ' roll variety . [ Honking ] [ whistle ] my gosh ! Snazzy car ! Sure is a welcome relief from that old wreck of yours . Hi , steve . Ow ! You know , i 'm really glad you called . It was , um ... a nice surprise . You know how much i wanted to go to this press conference and you let me tag along and i really appreciate that . Well , as a friend of mine said , " any woman in miami would give up a month of good sex just to see this blastoff . " But i know one gal who won 't have to . Frankie , how 's my- - how 's my hair look ? Um ... is it ok ? It 's fine . Sure ? Steve . Oh , alan , good to see you . I heard about your hand . The only thing affected is my golf game . Steve , can you excuse me for a minute ? All right . Yeah . You remember guy , don 't you ? Guy , good to see you . Jeff . You don 't have any business being here . Look , jeff , i 'm really sorry about what happened . But i 'm glad he 's fixed and everything 's ok . Who said he was ok ? The papers , the television . Well , he isn 't . He doesn 't work the way he was programmed to . What do you mean ? You don 't even realize the damage you 've done , do you ? I have spent years developing ulysses so he could function in space alone . And now , in less than one month 's time , you have ruined him . Tell me this- - how 's he supposed to survive out there now when all he thinks about is you ? Ready , hon ? We are pleased you could all be here today to meet the ulysses android . The awesome distances involved in the exploration of deep space have always posed a serious dilemma . How could a man withstand the terrible isolation and confinement ? How could a machine be our eyes and ears ? We believe the ulysses android ... is the answer . [ Applause ] and now , let me introduce ulysses himself . Hello , i am the ulysses android developed by dr . Jeff peters at chemtec , and i am here to answer any questions . [ All speaking at once ] we 're curious to know what your feelings are concerning your imminent departure into space . I 'm an android . I don 't have feelings . But it looks like your program contains a lot of human tendencies . These minor technical errors have been corrected . The question everyone 's dying to ask is , are you still lovesick ? No . Next question . Aren 't you frightened going up there alone for seven years ? No . That 's easy . It 's people who are frightening . They walk around hurt and confused and more alone then i will ever be in space . People can build an incredibly sophisticated space program , and yet they can 't solve their most basic problem- - how to love and care for those who love them . Someday when people have figured that out , they might be more than just machines . [ Applause ] jesus christ ! This guy could run for president . What are you doing here ? I just wanted to tell ulysses good-bye . I don 't think that 's very appropriate . Do you ? No . Probably not . Man : minus 10 ... 9 , 8 , 7 , main engine start , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 ... liftoff ! This evening marked the dawn of a new era in space travel . At 6 : 42 p.m. eastern daylight time , the ulysses android was successfully launched on its seven-year mission into deep space . It was a near-perfect liftoff viewed by an enthusiastic crowd of over 10,000 , many of whom carried signs and banners with their best wishes for the charismatic ulysses , who so recently has captured the heart and imagination of this nation . Congressman marcus , who earlier this week made headlines with the android , was among the dignitaries at the press conference yesterday to bid ulysses a farewell and bon voyage . The launch from pad number 19 ... [ doorbell rings ] was broadcast live via satellite to over 60 countries throughout the world . We take you now for a summary of today 's launch to flight director charles kraftman at mission control . We will be speaking directly with ulysses in the capsule . Dr. Peters , what are you doing here ? Oh , god , i miss him so much . [ Sobbing ] what ... jeff , what are you doing ? I love you . Ulysses ? Mmhmm . I love you , too . [ Bleep bleep bleep ] oh , no ! No ! I 'm sorry , frankie . I always seem to fall apart at the wrong time . That 's ok , ulysses . Nobody 's perfect . That 's good news , hank . [ Beep ] man : ulysses , how is the mission going so far ? [ Beep ] it truly is the most exciting thing in the world . [ Beep ] is it difficult functioning out there all alone ? [ Beep ] [ beep ] no . You see , i 'm not very good with people . * Imagine me and you * * i do * * i think about you day and night * * it 's only right * * to think about the girl you love * * and hold her tight * * so happy together * * if i should call you up * * invest a dime * * and you say you belong to me * * and ease my mind * * imagine how the world could be * * so very fine * * so happy together * * i can 't see me loving nobody but you * * for all my life * * when you 're with me , baby , the skies will be blue * * for all my life * * me and you and you and me * * no matter how they toss the dice * * it had to be * * the only one for me is you * * and you for me * * so happy together * * i can 't see me loving nobody but you * * for all my life * * when you 're with me , baby , the skies will be blue * * for all my life * * me and you and you and me * * no matter how they toss the dice * * it had to be * * the only one for me is you * * and you for me * * so happy together * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba * * me and you and you and me * * no matter how they toss the dice * * it had to be * * the only one for me is you * * and you for me * * so happy together * * so happy together * * and how is the weather ? * * So happy together * * we 're happy together * * so happy together * * ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba * captioning made possible by mgm home entertainment

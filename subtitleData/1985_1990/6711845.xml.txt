 Hi . I 'm Jake Sibley . That 's my family and that 's our home in good old Dayton , Ohio . My life was terrific until my dad got this job in England and took us all with him to the other side of the world . See my mom and my dad and my sister keep telling me how great it is here . But I don 't get it . Any place where they drive on the wrong side of the road , play all the wrong sports , and it rains all the time can 't be that great . The truth is I 'd like to go home . Here 's to another beautiful day . What are you up to , Sarah ? - We 're going on a field trip today . Oh , that 's nice . I wish Jake would go on a field trip or something . Any trip to the USA , Jake would be out of here like a shot . Good morning Jake . Straighten your tie dear . Why do I have to dress like this ? I mean , I feel like I park cars for a living . Oh , come on , it 's not that bad . All your friends have to wear uniforms . All my friends live in Dayton , Ohio dad . I don 't know anyone here yet . And if I did they wouldn 't know that the Yankees are playing a double header against the Indians today . And if I told them they wouldn 't care . I don 't have any friends here and I never will . Well , you know Fiona Penwarden . Or you 'd like to . Shut up , Sarah . Don 't you talk to your sister like that . Now who is Fiona Penwarden ? She 's some girl who lives down on the corner , I don 't even know her . I 've seen her twice . He means stared at her . He was practically drooling . He wants to ask her to the dance next Saturday . But he 's too scared . You know , an accident can be arranged . You were never shy before , Jake . I never lived in England before , dad . I mean , if you haven 't noticed , they do things differently here . It 's all coats and ties and I 'm terribly terribly pleased to meet you . And even if I did talk to her she 'd probably think I was a total nerd . No way , people aren 't that different here . Hey , did this phone ring ? Huh ? Watch my mouth : Did this phone ring ? No . No , it didn 't . No hold on , why shouldn 't she like you ? You 're a good looking boy . - Yeugh . Mom , she 's much too classy for him . You know , I 'd like to stay at this table and get picked on for another hour or two , really I would . But I don 't want to find out what happens to you if you 're late for school . I think they 'll probably beat me with a stick . Have a nice day , dear . Jake ... Why don 't you just ask the girl ? - What if she says no , dad ? Well that 's better than not knowing . And she might say yes . Look , you just got to join in with life here a bit more . It 's an adventure . Take some risks . What have you got to lose ? Thanks dad . Take some risks . What have I got to lose ? Oh , just total humiliation . My life . You know , that sort of thing . Fiona Penwarden . That 's her . Alright , stay cool Jake . Just relax , just stay calm . Hold it out , lad . Keep it steady ! Help me up then lad , don 't just stand there . I told you to hold that thing steady . You 've ruined a perfectly good second hand tabbard . What 's going on ? What am I doing here ? People on quests don 't ask questions like that . What did you do that for ? Good question . Bright lad . Well , it 's tradition , I suppose . I 'm obliged to if you answer back . What if I don 't answer back ? You always do . Pages always answer back , otherwise it 's considered dumb insolence . You 're not being dumb and insolent are you ? - Good lad , well done . - Thank you . They always do . Right , now this quest ... Aren 't you going to ask me what quest ? It 's alright to talk if I ask you to . - Ah , okay . - Sometimes . Right , off we go . I have here a love letter from prince Kevin the Rich . He thought he might not be rich enough to land this very rich princess so he 's gone off on a crusade or two , and gave me this proposal of marriage . We must brave many hazards , dragons and so on , to deliver it to his beloved , the princess Yeugh . That is our quest . Our quest ? No , no no no . I 'm not on a quest , I 'm not even a page , I shouldn 't even be here . Stop . The rules of questing subsection B , pages , says : Rule one . Until the quest is finished , no page may claim that he is not a page , not on a quest , or should be somewhere else , on pain of dismemberment . Rule two is exactly the same , only slightly more cruel . I once had a page who claimed that he was from another century . Oh yeah , what happened to him ? Burned at the stake . Heresy , I think it was . Great . So tell me about this princess Yeugh . I mean she sounds kind of horrible . She 's called Yeugh because her parents thought it would be character forming . But she is ludicrously rich , and also a princess , and therefore , pretty . But I expect she is the usual curvaceous blonde , with pert , shapely ... things , and so on and so on . Come in ! What do you mean , come in , we can 't come in , we 're all out . Well , if we 're all out , I 'm not in . Good day to you . Damn , damn . Oh , damn . Oh , sorry about all that . Have a nice day . I wonder what that was all about . Witches don 't usually appear for nothing . Oh , I nearly forgot . Had a note for you . Got burnt . It just said , beware . Well that 's not particularly useful is it . Didn 't it even say when we had to beware ? Only beware , beware ! Even more stupid than I thought . Right . Now for this dragon . - Dragons don 't exist . - Quite right lad . Dragons is a metaphor for some unspeakable horror . The road to the castle should cross the stream round about here . I think there is a troll bridge . - Will we have to pay ? - Right , that 's it . I 'm not going any further with you . - Why ? What did I do ? That was a blatant attempt at a pun , the second lowest form of wit . You heard perfectly well it is a bridge guarded by a troll , not a toll bridge . I won 't move any further until you 've apologized . - I 'm sorry . - Right . So what is a troll anyway ? Well , it 's a sort of huge , pointy , fierce , hairy , slimy greenish uncooperative entity which eats people . Smaller people . Anyone under five foot eleven . - That 's , that 's very specific . - They are . But that 's no more than you not liking eggplant . Do you like eggplant ? - No way . Well there you are then . How tall are you ? Five ten and a half with shoes . Shoes don 't count . Wait a second , so if I try to cross this bridge , this thing is going to eat me ? Unless we distract it in some way . Don 't worry , I have a plan . Look out , there 's someone behind you . Aha ! What a life . I 've been knocking people in this river and eating them for twenty eight , no , thirty years . And what do I get ? " Look out , there 's someone behind you . " There must be more to life than this . He kind of sounds like my father . Middle age , I suppose . It 's only a phase . So how do we get around him ? You should know that . Distract him . Wait , I thought you had a plan . That 's it . Off you go , you can do it . Good plan , real good plan there . I die , you watch . Good morning . Are you talking to me ? Yeah . You know , I thought there was supposed to be a troll around here or something . Oh really ? He must have gone . You know , I really like your shirt . - Shirt ? - Your shirt , it 's brilliant . - What , this ? - Yeah . It 's trendy . Did you get that around here ? No . I 've had it for years . No kidding . And who does your hair ? What do you mean ? Well I mean , it 's awesome . What do you mean , " it 's awesome " ? I mean it 's spiky , and it looks good . No ... ! Do you really think so ? Yeah , really . Do you get I cut around here ? No , no , it just grows like this . You are so lucky , I could never do that with my hair . Well , it is different . Different ? Your hair is fantastic . Well , yes , I suppose it is a bit fantastic , yes . It is certainly the best hair in the forest , yeah . Yeah , I think you got something there . Trendy , hey ? Fancy that . You are a nice young man . - Well done ! - I did it , didn 't I ? Now , things begin to get tricky . Look out , behind you . Look , I 'm not talking about other centuries , it 's just that , you know , I came from some place else , and I 'd like to get back there . Me too , but I can 't tell you any more , wouldn 't be sufficiently intriguing . Now these quests usually end in success , right , I mean , you know , knights and pages don 't usually get killed ? No no . Might lose the odd limb or two , but ... Ah , there 's an inn , they should be able to direct us . Landlord ! - No ! Can you tell us the whereabouts of castle Grede ? - Never heard of it . - No . No . There ain 't no castle of that name ' round here . You take my advice , you steer well clear of it . Even if there was . This nonexistant castle , would it be about a mile away ? No ! That 's where it would be , if it were there . If this castle was there , it wouldn 't be dangerous , would it ? Well , some people do say as scores of princes have been up there , suitors to princess Yeugh , and none of them has never come back . They was eaten by the metaphor . Excuse me , may we be of some help ? Lobsters ? Don 't be so prejudiced . We 're only touring ourselves , but we do have a map . It 's very detailed you know . Well , it needs to be , for cycling . Excuse me I hope you don 't mind me asking , but are either of you two princes ? - No . - No ? Pity . They won 't let you in then . Wait , we have to see the princess Yeugh . I mean now will they know we 're not princes ? Torture . Though why anyone would want to see her I 'm afraid I just don 't know . I 'm told facially , she has got about as much going for her as the average prawn . I thought you said she was great looking . Chivalry . Thank you . Right , now for this castle . There it is . Perhaps now you 'll trust lobsters . Lovely hat , only one orner . No thanks , I 'm quite fond of the one I have , thank you . Grab jewels , special offer ! Play a song for the princess , sir ! Best flowers , duckie ? Not just now , but they are very nice . Last will and testament . Last will and testament . Ah , it 's clearly one of your fearsome metaphors . We 'd like to see the princess Yeugh . Are you princes ? - No , but eh ... - Then push off ! You know , that coat looks fantastic on you . And so it does . I 've been thinking . You 've been a very good page . I ought to reward you . I 've decided to allow you to complete this quest . Why me , is it dangerous ? Of course it 's dangerous , it 's a quest . Can 't become a knight until you 've completed a quest or two . - That was very good . - I am a knight . Right . Climb this , find the princess , and read this to her . Good luck . No , you don 't understand , I failed P.E. I cannot do that . You could with encouragement . What , wait a second , what are you doing , I can 't do this . - You see , it 's not so hard . - Then you do it . This never would have happened if I would have stayed in America . I 've got five of his shirts in soak , it 's that new iron maiden , you get much more splashing then you get with the old ones . Don 't I know it , we 've got three , it spurts everywhere . Still , it 's more of a deterrent , isn 't it . We 've got four new dungeons , really nice . Ever so cramped and damp , and smelly and slimy , and they 've been built with racks en suite . Our eight new dungeons with racks en suite will have especially imported Sicilian slime . Oh absolutely , we have Sicilian slime pumped through to all our dungeons . Don 't know how to cope without it . Sorry love . Got to be a little bit late for lunch . Got an emergency rack job on . Hello mrs . Gantlet , how 's Buddy then ? Busy ? Up to his knees in eyeballs . Still , musn 't grumble . Not when the work 's coming in . Who 's on the rack ? Some git they found wandering through the castle . Said he 'd lost his way . I said , pull the other leg , I 'm going to stretch both of yours . - What 's that all about ? - I don 't know , but they worry me . Right lad , now for the big one . Beryl , we 've got another one . Oh no , the bin 's full up . Oh prod it down a bit and sit on the lid . Their majesties will be with you presently . No , no , I just came to leave a note . I thought that last one was showing a little promise until he allowed himself to be strewn all over the room like that . - Good evening . - Ah , there you are . - Good afternoon . - Hello . - Good evening . - Open wide . - What ? - Open your mouth wide . Oh dear . Two and a quarter . A bit generous I 'm afraid . - Generous ? - Yes , scarcely greedy at all . It 's on the borderline . Never mind . We 'll allow you to carry on . - Good evening . - Now then . Let me explain the procedures of courtship for all the princes . No , see , you don 't understand , I 'm not a ... Be quiet . I 'm expounding my theory . Good evening . Now you see , we are ludicrously rich . Certainly the greediest people in the kingdom . My wife is so greedy that she restricts herself to the use of only two words , " good evening " . Because she is terrified of giving anything away . - Good evening . - There you go . Now I 've been making a scientific study of family trees . In all the wealthiest families , if the two partners are greedy , then their offspring are greedy . But if one of the partners is even slightly generous , then three out of the four children will be wanton spendthrifts . Good evening ! So to protect the wealth of our children 's children , we 've let it be known that my daughter is physically repellent . This is to encourage the right type . Now if they pass the mean mouth test , then it 's on to the final , where they have to be greedy enough to overcome extreme fear . Extreme fear ? - Good day . - Good evening . But I 'm not a prince . Hello ? Hello ? Princess Yeugh ? Yes . You must be the prince . Oh ! Oh ! I have ehm ehm , something to read to you . Oh ! I don 't need this . If it would made any sense , it would say that you 're the most beautiful girl ever . I 've never met anyone like you . A guy would risk anything for you . Oh lovely ! Mummy , daddy ! I think this may be the one . Alright , here they come darling . Here come the wolves . - The wolves ? - Daddy 's pets . He says a true prince won 't mind them a bit . - But I 'm not a prince . - Not a prince ? No . And the message I brought you was from prince Kevin the Rich . I mean , I 'm just Jake Sibley from Dayton , Ohio . And I 'm not rich . - Not rich ? Oh bother . I 've just fallen in love for the first time . Oh spit . Jake ! Help ! Hurry ! Boy am I glad to see you ! Well done lad , you did it ! I did ? Does this mean the quest is over ? There 's always another quest . Another quest ? Oh ! Right ! I 've got to take the risk . I mean what do I have to lose ? Wait ! Hi . My name is Jake Sibley , I moved in to the house from America . I was wondering if you 'd like to go to the school dance with me on Satuday night . - I 'd be delighted . - Really ? I 've got to dash , or I 'll be late . See you later .

 What 's your name , son ? My name is daryl . And what you doing up in these parts , hmm ? I don 't know . Foul ! Foul ! Foul ! It wasn 't ! Foul ! You saw it . You saw it , didn 't you ? Foul , right ? I 'm sorry ? Was it a foul ? I don 't ... I don 't , uh ... I 'm sorry . Weird . Very weird . Still say it 's a foul . No ! No way , man ! Foul , man ! Good . Can you read the letters on that board over there ? E , f , p , t , o , z , I , p , e , d , p , e , c , f , d , f , e , I , e , d , f , c , z , p . Hi , hon . Hi . Daryl , this is elaine . Hello . Hello . Honey , we 've got the tarnoff hearing tomorrow morning . Do you want me to bring the notes home ? Yeah , great . Nice to meet you , daryl . You , too . Bye . Bye , now . Hi , mr . Fox . Hi , ronnie . Take a seat right there . Ok , uh , one thing you can be sure of , daryl , is that somewhere , somebody is looking for you , and , uh , we 'll hear from them . Until then , we 're gonna try to make you as comfortable as we know how . Howie ? Excuse me a moment , daryl . Physically , he 's 100 % . But he is suffering substantial amnesia . He doesn 't remember parents , home , anything like that . It 's probably psychological rather than pathological memory loss . He handles it well , though . So you can certainly go ahead . Good . Thanks , joe . Well ... You 're just gonna spend a night or two here , daryl . Then , uh , we 'll find a family that wants to look after you until , uh , your own folks come and take you home , Ok ? Thank you . It 's extremely kind of you to be looking after my welfare like this . Yeah , well , that 's what we do here . Well , it 's getting there . Hey ! Thank you , wes . Yeah , well , you see , some of us stiffs gotta work for a living , you know ? Not like some guys I know . So how was the vacation ? Fantastic . Great . Listen , andy , there 's something I want to talk to you about . It 's not exactly the way we hoped it would be , but , uh , you got a minute ? Uh-uh-Uhh ... No , it 's the sharp . And fingers like that . Ok ? Ok , melanie . I think that 's enough for today . Remember to practice those scales , huh ? Yes , mrs . Richardson . It 's just I had a lot of homework . Of course you did . Of course you did . But , gosh , I wonder if mozart ever complained about homework . Go on . Tell your mom you 're doing great . Thanks , mrs . Richardson . You 're welcome . Bye , mr . Richardson . Bye , melanie . Bye-bye . Hello . Hi . Your last one ? Why ? You want to fool around ? Howie came by the site today . And they have a kid at the center . He 's a boy , he 's 9 or 10 years old , and they need a foster home while they try and locate his parents . Howie asked if we 'd help . Well , that 's what we 're registered for , isn 't it ? Yeah . I just wanted you to be sure . The child has some memory loss . Well ... I mean , they 're never going to let us adopt a child if we don 't foster one . We 're really happy to have you with us , daryl . Thank you , mrs . Richardson . Joyce . Joyce . You can call me joyce , and , uh , this is andy . Joyce . Andy . It 's really great to have you here , daryl . Ok ! Come on . Let 's show you around . Hey , daryl . Catch . Oh . Sorry . I am very , very happy . Joyce , he might not be with us for that long . Do you mind if we don 't talk about that right now ? Sure . Hi , turtle ! How 's the vacation ? It was Ok . And I found something even more interesting than vacation . What was that ? Watching paint dry . So , where 's this famous kid you got ? Famous kid ? My dad keeps on saying how he 's real cute . I think it 's envy . Even though I keep pointing out he 's got a 100 % boy of his own , namely me . Daryl 's upstairs . I 'll go get him . Daryl ! Daryl , sweetheart , can you come down here a minute ? There 's somebody here I 'd like you to meet . Hey ! I hear he doesn 't remember where he 's from . I mean , is he ... you know ... No , he isn 't . And it 's not a subject you discuss with him , Ok ? Oh . Ok . Promise me . The subject of his memory loss is out . Deal ? Scout 's honor . I don 't get it . You remember how to read , you remember your name , stuff like that . But you don 't remember your family , your school , if you 've got brothers or sisters . It doesn 't make sense . Well , the doctor said maybe my memory could come back suddenly . Only no one really knows . We better get back . You want to come over to my house ? If we 're real nice to her , maybe hookie will let us play with the new computer . Ok . Who 's hookie ? My sister , sherie lee . Hookie ? Amateur hooker . She dates every night . I just invented the name . It really pisses her off . What 's a hooker ? Did joey have a good run ? Got some air into joey 's lungs , did he ? He must 've done 10 miles today , mrs . Kent . Same time tuesday . Don 't forget . Joey gets all excited when he knows it 's your day to exercise him , turtle . All right . Thanks . So how come you can remember your name , but you can 't remember anything else ? You 're boring us . You came into my room and started with my computer . I can bore anyone I like in my room . Amnesia is selective , which means there 's always partial memory . For example , I haven 't forgotten how to speak . You struck out , stupid . 45,100 . Ok , let 's see your best score . Ok . 45,100 , turtle . Can I have a try ? I 'll have to teach you how to play . Hey , twerp , let him try . Joyce says he 's so smart , let 's see him prove it . I think I understand . Oh , my ... 79,950 . That 's a fun game . Not bad . Daryl richardson . You swear you never played this before ? I don 't think so . Right . But for all you know , you could 've invented pole position . Aw , come on , hookie , don 't ... Will you stop calling me that ? ! And I 'm not kidding . It seems to annoy your mother , too . Of course it does . That 's the whole point . I don 't understand why you want to annoy your family . For a genius , you can be real stupid . Come on . What is a hooker ? Aah ! Hey , fellas , wait for me ! Hey . It 's Ok , joyce . I 'll take him in . Oh , well , I think daryl might like ... You want a kid to show up for his first day at school with his mother ? God ! Daryl ? I appreciate the concern , joyce , but I 'm sure turtle can show me around . Come on , let 's go . Do you know how I despise cheating ? Could you imagine what life would be like without hope of ever getting back into my good graces ? I only asked ... Silence ! That girl showed you how to do it during a test . That is cheating . That entitles me to call you a cheat , a despicable cheat . Now , because it is monday ... And out the goodness of my heart , I will pretend as if it didn 't happen . But ... I am lousy at pretending . So if it happens again ... Exchange your papers with each other ... Quietly , please ... For correction . Ahem ! You . Yes , that boy , you . What do you think you 're doing ? Changing the answers on somebody else 's paper ? I 'm correcting them , as you asked . But I haven 't given you the answers yet . You 'll find that they 're all correctly checked . I 've marked number 9 as right , although in fact there is an error in the eighth decimal place . But only a calculus system could show that . I guess the main thing to understand , guys , is that ... Baseball is the essence of all life in the universe . Therefore , we don 't fool around , we don 't , uh , joke about this . We take this very seriously . Otherwise we go play something else , Ok ? Like washing the car . Want to try and hit a few ? Come here . Ok , sure . Just do just like I showed you . Just like on the baseball cards . You kind of stand sideways , I 'm gonna pitch it by you , and you take a swing at it . See what happens . Ok ? No , you 're not gonna need this . Whole other part of the game . Uh-huh . Ok ? Ok , daryl . You ready ? I 'll take it easy on you the first time . Ow ! My fault , my fault . I should 've told you ... You gotta grip the bat pretty firmly , you know ? Otherwise , that 's gonna happen . But you got good instincts . You hit the ball , didn 't you ? Yeah . Major leaguer all the way . I can see it in the eyes . Ok ? Here ... Nice firm grip , nice easy swing , and just knock the ball into the middle of interstate 95 for me , Ok ? Ok , I 'll try . That 's all I 'm asking . Ok , daryl . Here it comes . Was that all right ? Better ... better . We 'll try it again . Turtle , come here . You 're sworn to secrecy , all right ? Ok . Yeah . Uh , daryl , I 'm gonna throw it a little bit harder this time , Ok ? So it 'll be traveling a little bit faster . So just do your best . Ok , I 'll try . Daryl ... Turtle , come here . You 're a natural . You 're a genius . And in 4 weeks ' time , you 're my secret weapon . The warriors ! We 're gonna murder them ! Yes ? Only no one must know about this , Ok ? So you don 't say anything about this to anybody . Ok . About what ? About what ? I just love this kid . Oh , he 's so modest . It 's awesome . I don 't even believe it myself . Uh-huh . One more pitch ? One more pitch , and then I 'll wake up . Ok . Ok ? Ohh ! Well , practice is over ! Come on , get your stuff . How can you trust a man like andy ? He makes daryl swear an oath of secrecy , then he comes in and tells me . Next you two come over and he opens his mouth again . The only person who must know nothing about this until tomorrow is bull mckenzie . He is so cocky . Were you there at the game last year when he suggested we forfeit in the fourth inning ? No , but turtle told me all about it . But didn 't you guys rally in the sixth and almost tie up the game ? Yeah . Sure , because somebody decided . To save our team 's honor by spiking the warriors cokes with vodka . What ? ! You know , you 're lucky you weren 't sued . It 's against the law serving alcohol to minors . I didn 't serve anything . It wasn 't even my idea . So who did ... When 's dinner ? You didn 't . What ? You did . Oh , god , turtle ! What did I do now ? I just walked in the door , for christ sake . Oh , sorry , turtle , your mother just found out about the vodka in the warriors ' cokes last year . Oh . Well , it wasn 't vodka . It was just plain water . Well , I 've got one smart son . You owe me 7.50 for liquor , turtle . Is there anything I can do to help ? Yeah , you can call sherie lee . She went out with mark bennet . What does she see in that boy ? Sherie lee says he 's sexy , but turtle says it 's because he has the biggest ... Daryl ! Howie , is it me or is it ... No . What , joyce ? Well , is there something about daryl that 's a little ... Joyce ... No . Wait a minute . Let her finish . Howie ? He 's a nice boy . He 's very bright . Bright enough to make you feel like he is ... different . But he 's so helpful and honest for a boy his age . I mean ... I don 't believe what I 'm hearing . You 're complaining because you 've got the kind of kid that most of us would trade our own in for and pay money ? Relax , howie . I was only kidding . About the money . No , no , I 'm not complaining . I love daryl . I really do hope we 'll be able to adopt him . It 's just he doesn 't , uh ... He doesn 't seem to need anybody . This is cq to qc . Come in , qc . This is cq to qc . Come in , qc . Over . This is qc . Come in , cq . What is happening ? Over . Cq reporting . She 's gonna start hooking any second , right in front of her own home . My god , she 's shameless . Oh , this is disgusting . Censored , censored . Bleep bleep bleep . My god , I 'm too young to be looking at this . Sherie . His filthy hand on her levis , touching her . Oh , look at that , just look at it ! He 's practically raping her , except she 's cooperating . Turtle , will you shut up . Knock it off , turtle ! It 's almost midnight . Cq , this is qc . I heard . Good night . Cq signing off , a little more educated , a little more shocked by his sister . All knowledge is learning and therefore good . This is qc signing off . Sleep well , miss . Thank you , robbie . You . Come here . I 'm gonna bat you fourth , Ok ? Mm-hmm . That way , if we can get jody to bunt and if we can get jody stay on base , we 've got a prayer . Oh , great . Ohh , they screwed up again . I know I got at least $ 1,500 in there . Uh , what 's your I.D. Number ? Hmm ? Oh , no , the bank computer messed up again , daryl . Computers don 't make errors . People do . Maybe it was keyed in wrong . All right . 2822 . How much do you want ? Mm-hmm . You got it ? Terrific . Give me 100 . Yeah ! All right , well , what does it say I 've got in there ? Oh , enough . Get back in the car ! Daryl , grab my card , would you ? Ok . Daryl , come on , let 's go ! Thank you for using . The time machine . You 're welcome . The first bankers look forward to serving you again . Come on , guys , get it together ! You call that a fast ball ? He could have caught that with his lips . That 's it ! That 's it ! Come on , ivan . That 's it . Come on ! Right ! Like before , guys . Right , come on . Move it , damn it . Yo , bull . Good luck . Luck ? Luck didn 't win us the championship 3 years in a row . Teamwork did . Practice . Discipline and teamwork . Huh . Luck is for losers . Jody 's mother forgot the sodas , so there 's none . And there 's no ice . Run home and tell your mother . I 'll tell you what , she 's probably at our house by now . Run , turtle . We 've only got 10 minutes . Run ? You 've got a car . Haul ass , turtle , if you want to sit on it again . Fastest base runner in the league and he exhausts me right before the game . You know , I don 't believe you , joyce . You 've got this wonderful kid , the boy you 've been waiting for all your life ... I know , he 's a wonderful kid , but he 's so damn willing . He doesn 't leave any room for me to do anything . He wants to please you . What 's so tough about that ? He irons his own clothes , makes his own breakfast , polishes the bedroom floor . He 's a better mother than I am . Sodas . Ice . Mrs. Keith forgot . The massacre starts in 5 minutes . Sodas ! Ice ! It 's gonna be another massacre . Safe ! You 've got your work cut out for you , daryl . Wait for your pitch . Don 't rush it , Ok ? And listen , just come around easy on the ball , Ok ? Just come around and meet the ball , Ok ? There you go . Have you ever played ball before ? Can it . Look at him . Easy out . Don 't worry . All right ! Daryl , you have to run , daryl ! Run , daryl , run ! Don 't worry . We 'll stop him ... On the next one . So don 't worry . Hey , bull ! He 's little , but he 's mean ! He 's silent but deadly ! Hey , let 's talk about your pitcher ! Put the fork in him . He 's done ! Ha ha ha ha ! Andy 's so happy . He 's says we haven 't been ahead even once before . That 's right , daryl , we haven 't . Not till you came along . Daryl , I 've been meaning to give you my speech about grownups . It 's a great speech . I meant to give it to you weeks ago . I 've done something to upset her . She 's mad at me . Grownups have to feel like they 're making progress with you . You got to mess up sometimes , just enough so you don 't get whacked , so they feel like you 're learning something , see ? It 's a real art . Trust me . Leave your room in shit order sometimes . Joyce needs to feel useful . You 're so damn helpful and good and thoughtful , I don 't know why I like you . Strike 3 ! That 's the speech . Screw up a little . Grownups need to be pissed off with kids . Thanks . All right , ivan , smoke him ! I 'm saying we smoke him this time ! Strike ! Come on , 2 more ! Strike ! Strike 3 ! Whoa , yeah ! How about that , andy , huh ? How 's that for good baseball ? Listen , there 's no need to blow the whole game . You think the game is more important than joyce ? Hey , what happened ? Daryl , what 's going on ? I don 't even like the game . I mean , all it is is a pecker contest between you and mckenzie . What ? Daryl , don 't talk to andy like that . Kiss my ass . I don 't believe it . Daryl , come back here ! Good . There goes the game . We could make a deal with him . He 'll hit another one if you kiss his ass . Andy wants to win so badly , he 'd probably do it , too . Daryl ! Sweetheart ! There 's , uh ... There 's something we ... No . Too short . There 's something we need to talk about . I guess I really screwed up , didn 't I ? It 's Ok ... all right ... To screw up once in a while . I mean , gosh , everybody does . Yeah , that 's what turtle ... I mean , that 's what I figured . But it 's really Ok ? Of course it is . It 's just ... Well ... Your language was ... Not too good , huh ? Uh-uh . I 'd like to apologize for that . Next time I screw up , I 'll watch my mouth . Ok , turtle , it 's up to you , buddy . Come on , turtle ! There 's 2 outs . Run on anything . Strike ! Pick it out . That 's all . Come on , turtle ! Strike ! Turtle , you represent the winning run , turtle ! The winning run ! Come on , ivan . Take us home . Take us home . Come on . Let 's wrap this up . Come on . Yeah ! Yeah ! Josh ! Get the ball ! Oh , no ! Come on , turtle ! Turtle , come on ! Come on ! Hit the dirt , turtle ! All right , turtle ! Yeah ! Daryl ! Daryl , we won ! Good-bye , coach . Good-bye , mrs . Richardson . Bye-bye . So the notes in the spaces are f , a , c , and e . But only in the treble clef . And the notes on the line are ... E , g , b , d , and f . With your right hand . Every good boy does fine . Whole note , 2 half notes , and 4 quarters to a measure . You got it . If there was anything I could do ... Anything ... You know I would find a way of doing it . How do we really know that he 's theirs ? Andy , there 's no doubt that he 's their child . Look at the photographs . What kind of people are they ? Daryl . How you doing ? I 'm all right , thanks . Listen , could we talk for a minute ? Of course . I just wanted to ... Well , I thought maybe we should , uh ... Why don 't you sit down ? Yeah . Thanks . Look , I just wanted you to know how much ... I 'm sure you already know how much joyce and I are gonna miss you . I know . Me , too . Daryl , your parents love you , and they 're your real parents , and they 've been looking for you for months . And they want you back . But what if I want to be with you ? Children belong to their parents . You mean like your car belongs to you ? No , nothing like that . Dad ... I mean andy . Yeah ? I won 't forget you , will I ? Of course not . We 're gonna stay in touch , aren 't we ? Mr. Richardson ? Yes . I 'm jeffrey stewart . This is my wife ellen . Pleased to meet you . Won 't you come in ? Daryl is quite all right ? Daryl is a tremendous young man . We certainly do envy you your son . He should be down in a minute or two . I think he 's a little bit nervous . You know how kids get . He 's nervous ? Can I get you a drink ... Or something ? No , no , thank you . My wife and I would like to thank you for all the kindness you 've shown daryl . Oh , it wasn 't hard . He 's a great kid . You 've formed a considerable attachment to him , I can see . We 're going to miss him , a lot , both of us . Yes , of course you are . Of course . Daryl . Hello , daryl . Do you remember us ? I think I do . You 're just fine , daryl . There 's nothing to worry about . Do you want to go and get your things ? Isn 't turtle coming over ? I can say good-bye to turtle , can 't I ? Turtle , it 's normal to feel bad about losing a friend , but you can 't duck out now and not say good-bye . Daryl 's expecting you to be there . He needs you to be there . Mom ... You promised him . Now , I want you to come with me right now and show your best friend you haven 't forgotten about him already . Come on . Let 's go . Turtle . Daryl . Do you know why your friend did that ? He 's mad at me ? No , I don 't think so . I think he 's gonna miss you , and that makes it hard for him to say good-bye . Can you imagine how he must feel ? Yes ... I can . Good . That 's very good . Turtle . Hey ! Write to me , Ok ? I 'll call you . Bye . Are we gonna fly ? Are we gonna fly in that ? You know what I don 't understand ? They just didn 't ask anything . You know , I mean , about daryl . It was like those pictures you showed us ... Completely anonymous . Just daryl in front of the same blank wall . Can I go see the pilot now ? Sure , you can . Ask him anything you want . Well , hi there , daryl . Come on in . So you want to learn how to fly this thing , huh ? I find it very interesting . Ok . Well , here 's your altitude and your air speed and your engine thrust . Right here is your horizon level indicator , and over here we have the ... You know , the extraordinary thing is that we 've accomplished something by accident that we wouldn 't have dared to do by intent . Putting him out there just to see what would happen . When dr . Mulligan kidnapped him , that was the best thing he could 've done . You were right about its learning potential . No , I was wrong . I think he 's learned a lot more than I ever thought possible . Ok , now , as a backup to the computer , uh , you should check visually . Now , here 's the navigation chart we 're on . We 're there , right ? You 're right . That 's exactly right . Very good . You have been paying attention . Ok , now , you take that figure from the trip computer and then enter your coordinates : Your air speed , your wind factors , your time calculations , and the figures should match your rough calculations of , uh , latitude north 28 degrees , 39.4 minutes . 6 . What ? 28 degrees , 39.6 minutes . You said 4 , but on the database given , it 's 28 degrees , 39.6 minutes . Well , I 'll be . It is . Kid 's after your job , major ... uh , harry . So if I wanted to go back home , I 'd , uh , just feed in the coordinates and instruct the autopilot ? Whatever we do , there 's no way he can be categorized as normal . I thought that was understood . Daryl . Did you see everything up front ? Yes , thank you . Why don 't you come and sit down and let el ... Your mom fix you something to drink . Juice or something ? What would you like , daryl ? Are you really my mom and dad ? John , would you please ... this is t . K ... Would you please turn the sound up on monitor 6 ? I think the problem is right there . Can you reactivate the memory without surgery ? I think dr . Mulligan provoked specific overload , not a burnout . At some point , he wanted daryl to know what he was . We 'll soon see . Now , let 's try talking to him . What made you change the way you were playing after turtle talked to you that day ? I interpreted the data to indicate that under certain conditions , error was more efficient than maximum performance . Under what conditions ? Relating with others . Ok , what do you say to that ? Perception of the optimum . The program is designed for it . Come on , daryl , take your pick ... Chocolate or vanilla ? I don 't know . I ... Well , how are you gonna know if you don 't try some ? I don 't know , uh , well ... Shit , daryl , if you don 't care , take the vanilla . Nah , I like the chocolate better . Can I assume this is a final decision ? Absolutely . Mary ellen , don 't eat that . Daryl spit in it . Yecch ! Did you mean it , that you preferred chocolate ? Oh , sure . Why ? I just did . Turtle likes raspberry . But there 's no difference . It tastes different . And he 's not programmed for taste . It 's programmed to learn . Not subjective preferences . He can analyze nutritional values , not choose between flavors . So it 's picking up behavior patterns . Please , stop calling him " it . " Thank you . We 've got to run some biochemical tests until we find where this comes from . Don 't worry , daryl . You can 't come to any harm . I promise we won 't hurt you . What are you gonna do ? Why do you have to do this ? We 're just going to take some samples . You won 't feel it . Dr. Stewart . What 's going on ? It just started . Doctor . This is crazy . It 's like someone 's playing around with the central computer . All right , daryl . We 'll forget the tests . No tests . Ok ? Your report makes some pretty extraordinary claims , dr . Stewart . Just simple observations , general . You 're now saying it can feel human emotions ? Yes . He experiences pleasure and pain . He also registers fear and anxiety . Fear ? Fear is something we don 't have a lot of use for on this project . " We , " general ? The people who are funding your research , doctor . The american taxpayer ? When your colleague dr . Mulligan ran off with this expensive piece of hardware , I didn 't hear you crying on behalf of the taxpayer . Because ... thanks to dr . Mulligan 's mistakes , we now know a lot more about daryl 's potential than we did before . Baseball ? Ice cream preferences ? Friendships ? That 's all right for america , but hardly what we need at the department of defense . The joint chiefs have made their decision in light of this report . The youth lifeform project as of now is terminated . The department has set out its requirements in this working paper . Basically , we need an adult version of this prototype ... Programmed to learn and then taught everything the army can teach ... A fearless , technically skilled , devastating soldier . D.A.R.Y.L. Goes to the scrap yard . Understood ? Yaaahhh ! Yaaahhh ! It 's just a matter of balance . However , we don 't suggest you try it next time you take your car out . After all , it 's taken buzz 20 years and hundreds of sets of tires to perfect his ... Hi . Hello . Should I turn them off ? Well , maybe down a little . They want to know how you do that . As a matter of fact , so do I. Well , I can sort of read what a computer is doing . You can control it ? I guess . I 'm getting better . But people ... You can tell what they 're thinking ? Oh , no , I 'm not telepathic or anything like that . Then how do you know what they 're feeling ? Well , you sort of guess at that , because you know what you 're feeling yourself . I 'd very much like it if you would let andy and joyce visit me . And your friend ... Turtle . Yes . I 'd really like that . I miss them . I really do . All right . Then we 'll tell them the truth . Doctor ? What am I ? What is he , ellen ? You 're not really going to bring those people here , are you ? I can give security clearance to anyone I choose , unless the military overrides me . And there 's no reason they should . Is there ? Ok , let 's go . Welcome to tascom , all of you . You said we could see daryl . Is he all right ? May we see him , please ? Yes . Just come this way . Doctor ... What is this ? Daryl is not ... Well , he never was ... Completely human . What ? Data ... analyzing ... Robot ... youth ... Lifeform . Daryl 's an experiment in artificial intelligence . All I can say is that he was never meant to leave here , and he was certainly never meant to be with ... People like yourselves . Holy shit . He 's robot ? He 's more than that , turtle . He 's a lot more . See , this is where we programmed the computer in daryl 's head . And this is where he discharges learned information into the mainframe memory . Wow . I don 't believe this . No . Look . Ask the computer any detail , no matter how small , something that could only be known to you and daryl . This is some kind of a joke . Oh , no . No , I 'm afraid not . Ok . It 's him . Doesn 't he know we 're here ? He can 't see us . But I just talked to him . No . You talked to his memory banks . That 's separate . Daryl ... a robot ? But he 's real . Look at him . He 's just a little boy , flesh and blood . Isn 't he ? Not even a doctor could tell the difference ... Unless he x-rayed the skull . Daryl wasn 't conceived in a womb , but in a laboratory test tube , with a computer brain provided by us . He 's growing just like a normal boy . But why ? Why all of this ? Because ... The 5 senses of the human body are the fastest , most efficient method of programming ever devised . Just imagine ... Sight , sound , touch , taste , smell ... You 've got all that going for you instead of some guy sitting at a computer terminal punching keys . Turtle ! Hi . You came with mom ... Joyce and andy ? I gave them the slip . They were listening to all that scientific crap about you . Did you know you were ... You were a robot ? Well , I guess ... No , not back home with andy and joyce . I lost my memory , remember ? But now ? Now I remember . How does it ... feel ? Just the same . But I mean , do you feel like ... I mean , like me ? I don 't know . I 'm not you . I think I feel like you . I mean , why wouldn 't I ? Oh , wow ! Well , I guess it wasn 't my coaching that was gonna put you in the hall of fame . You had the stuff all by yourself , didn 't you ? It 's good to see you , boy . Hi . Are you absolutely sure ? Yes , we 're sure . We 're sure . All right . Then give me , uh , give me 5 days . If you haven 't heard from me by then , make some phone calls . Call the press or , uh , tv stations , your congressman , anyone you can think of . It may be our only chance . And , turtle , remember ... Don 't talk to anyone . Right . Thank you . Ok , let 's go . Carter , take your section , secure the left flank . Rieser , get your section over to the right flank . You did the right thing in calling us , dr . Lamb . I 'm not placing you under arrest , dr . Stewart . Since you 've sealed off the whole building , that 's hardly a big concession . What the hell were you trying to do ? I told you . I believe that daryl is more than a machine . We have no right to destroy him . Do you share this view as a scientist ? No . Dr. Stewart has fallen into the same trap dr . Mulligan did ... Assigning human emotion where there is none , cannot be , in a machine . He is not a machine . Nobody believes that except you . The richardsons do . You 're asking us to destroy a child . The body is organic . He can hurt , die , decompose , just like you and me , general . Can you dispose of this prototype , dr . Lamb ? It 'd be a valuable loss of data . There are some aspects ... You have the work papers which notify you of our requirements for the next generation . I rely upon you to inform me when the disposal is accomplished , dr . Stewart , or ... shall I look to dr . Lamb for that ? I hope you 're both satisfied . I 've got a dr . Stewart here awaiting clearance . License rsd-843 . All right . Son of a bitch . First mulligan , then stewart , now you . Why ? General , a machine becomes human when you can 't tell the difference anymore . Get me the gate . Don 't stand there . Get the phone . Whoa . We made it . Can I come out now ? It 's hot under here . Be careful . We 're not clear yet . On the double , let 's go ! Come on ! ... Robot lifeform , license plate number . Romeo-sierra-delta 8-4-3 . Dr. Stewart is in his 50s , 6 feet tall , graying hair , wears glasses . They 're coming . I see them . Ok . Hang on . Watch out for the rock ! No , right ! You better turn the lights on or we 'll look suspicious . Yeah . Good thinking . You want me to drive ? No . No , you 'll attract too much attention . Pull it over , doctor . Move your vehicle to the curb . Turn onto the freeway . What ? I repeat ... move your vehicle to the curb ! Take the freeway , please . This is your last warning , doctor . Halt , or we 'll shoot . Hey , dummy ! Get that thing out of the way ! We seem to have attracted attention anyway . Oh , all right . You 've got to trust me now . Trust me , please . Look out ! We are in hot pursuit . We can never outrun them . Why don 't you just , uh , close your eyes and fasten your seat belt ? What are you gonna do , daryl ? It 's Ok . I 've done it before . Pursuit , east-west tollway . Right behind you . There 's a construction site up ahead . We can set a block at the interchange . We got him now , boys . We got him . Oh , no . Oh , my god , wait a minute . What are you doing , daryl ? It 's Ok . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm losing him , I 'm losing him . Look at that little sucker go . What the hell does he think he 's doing ? If we don 't stop him now , he 's gonna kill somebody . Pull it over , kid ! Pull over ! Stop , kid , or we 'll ... Oh , my god , hit the brakes ! Did you see those guys fly ? This is 12 . Everyone appears to be Ok . He 's pulling away . We 're gonna lose him . He 's taking the bells road off-ramp . Ok . Let 's see what we got here . Here . You write him a note . Tell him we 're sorry for the trouble , and he can keep the car . And , uh ... here 's $ 10 for the gas . Oh , boy . He 's getting one hell of a deal . I refuse to believe they can just disappear . They can 't , general , but we are spread pretty thin . When we sight them , we 'll get them . There 's an air base 4 miles down the road . We can ... uh-oh . What is it ? A roadblock . It 's just one car and one cop . That 's enough . Ok , buddy , check back . 149 clear . Howdy . Howdy . What 's going on ? Oh , nothing much . Just checking for a couple of runaways . Move out . Hey , officer , uh ... Have you got a light ? Uh ... back in the car . Oh , no , no . Never mind , never mind . I gotta quit , anyway . All right . Well , drive safely . Hey ! Pretty good , huh ? You were great . I sure hope he had breakfast . Down ! Keep down . Damn it , major , if it was a proper roadblock , nobody should have crashed it , least of all stewart and that ... child . Yes , sir . I want a full report . Yes , sir . These two must be caught or killed before they run to some busybody from the press . Yes , sir . You can still make it . You have to . I 'm sorry , daryl . If I was a little bit older , you could have given me a medical program ... And I could have gone to medical school . And that would be helpful . Look what I 've done to you . I 've made you a fugitive . I 've lied to you . I 've frightened you . I 've taken you from a family that loved you . You gave me everything , too . You made me what I am . I mean ... not a real ... Whatever happens ... I want you to remember this always . Always remember this . You are a real person . You are real . I only wish ... Base to 23-40 ... Hey , I 've got a fire alert here . I 've got them everywhere . Attention all personnel , attention all personnel . We have a major fire alert in sectors 1 , 4 , 5 ... The circuits are all screwed up . Every time I hit the switch , I 'm getting the late show . Yes , sir , I don 't understand ... Firefly one , abort , abort . When that plane leaves united states airspace , we have no choice . You 're going to shoot it down ? There 's not a missile built fast enough to catch it . So what are you gonna do ? Well , just in case of some monumental foul-up like this , we built an explosive charge into the airplane itself . When I give the command to destroy it , it explodes , instantly , wherever it is . Your aircraft will be destroyed . If you do not turn around before that time . Please respond . I repeat this warning . You leave u.S. Airspace in 6 minutes and 30 seconds . Mark that from ... now . Your aircraft will be destroyed if you do not turn around before that time . Please respond . Cq , this is your old pal qc . Will you wake up ? Qc calling cq . Daryl , where are you ? You wouldn 't believe me anyway . What 's he saying ? I don 't know , sir . He must 've changed frequencies . Find out what frequency he 's transmitting on . Listen , I 'll be home soon just like dr . Stewart promised . Don 't tell anyone , Ok ? It 's important . How soon is soon ? Less than 20 minutes . That 's a guess , because velocities are hard to calculate , and rates of descent . Oh , just meet me by the blue lake before school . You got it . Over and out , cq . Velocities ? Rates of descent ? What 's he doing ? Get this . 3 minutes and counting . A child with a stick of chewing gum has just rendered your $ 100 million worth of hardware useless . Any suggestions ? 2 minutes , 30 seconds and counting . 2 minutes , 15 seconds and counting . This is robbins . We have , uh , 3 units ready to scramble on your order . 30 seconds and counting . Stand by . Y-coordinate to pattern 8 , vector 1714 . Stand by . 15 seconds and counting . 10 , 9 ... 6 , 5 ... 1 , fire . Target vaporized 0608 , sir . Well , that 's that , general . He could have ejected . We have a tracking signal on the ejector mechanism . We 'd have picked it up instantly . I see . So where is he ? I don 't know . He said blue lake . Look . Oh , no . No . Please . Turtle , go for him . Go ! Try and stop one of those cars up there . Stop , please ! Stop ! Please ! Stop ! Please ! Please stop ! It 's Ok to cry , turtle . You loved him . But he can 't be dead . He can 't be . I feel the same way , turtle , but there 's nothing we can do . But he can 't die . Daryl 's a robot . Robots don 't die . Honey . Oxygen feeds your brain , but his brain 's a microcomputer . That can 't die . When you die , it means brain death . I know you can hear me , daryl . Daryl !

They 're waiting for you in conference room b . Excuse me , bruce , I have the floor . Frankie , I didn 't think that we were taking on Any new clients until after the marcus campaign .

And your mother called at 8 : 45 , 9 : 00 , 9 : 15- - Something about have you decided On the lime green bows Or the passion pink rhinestones For your shoes for your sister 's wedding ? Oh , god ! Tell her I 'm coming barefoot- - In black . Oh , wait . Hold ? Smile ... Perfect . Sorry , gentlemen , to keep you waiting . I 'm always late , but I 'm worth it . Ok , boys . Let 's see what you 've got . Man : Chemtec gives us america 's future today , Bringing space inside the american home . And now it is developing Its most extraordinary creation yet , The ulysses android , Destined to revolutionize the american way of life . Developed here at chemtec laboratory Under my direct supervision , Ulysses is the closest thing to man himself . The future applications for such an android Are virtually infinite : Handling hazardous chemicals , Detecting radiation , Disarming explosives , Fighting fires , Test-Piloting new aircrafts , And , of course , exploring space . The awesome distances , Prolonged periods of time , and tortuous confinement Have made deep space exploration problematic For the human pilot . We believe the ulysses android Is the answer . Ok , I think I 've seen enough . Bruce ? What do you think ? Well , it 's not gonna win any oscars . And what 's more important , We 're losing our funding in congress . That 's why we came here . We need to make people see How important this project is . Miss stone ... The ulysses android Is an amazing piece of equipment . Yeah , but ... I 'm not used to promoting hardware , doctor . I promote people . Politicians , businessmen , The occasional rock star . Dr. Ramdas ... Do you know who controls most of america 's tv dials And buys 72 % Of all magazines ? Women . And if this publicity campaign is gonna work , That , gentlemen , is your target group . This sounds like something you could do In , say , 35 Days ? Only if I can publicize the android My Way , And that means full media saturation . And I promise you , boys , I 'll have everyone in congress itching To fund your program before you can say E.T. Welcome to chemtec . Parking in lot c . Thanks . Welcome to chemtec , miss stone . Oh , dr . Ramdas , it 's a pleasure . Quite a facility you 've got . Well , thank you . It 's the way Of the future . Your visitor 's pass . Would you follow me , please ? Sure . P.A. : Paging dr . Nipatoe . Dr. Nipatoe to robotics , room d , please . Dr. Nipatoe ... This is where ulysses was born . In the future , Making love will no longer be necessary For the creation of life . It can all be done far more efficiently In the lab . How romantic . Of course , I myself Prefer the old-Fashioned way . Why don 't you wait in here ? I 'll see if dr . Peters is free . I know he 'd like to meet you . Okey-Dokey . Oh ! Oh , hi , you must be dr . Peters . I 'm frankie stone . What do you call these ? What ? Oh--Wh- - What are you- - You 've been in this lab too long , buddy ! P.A. : Paging dr . Stevenson . You 're wanted in image processing , dr . Peterberg . Oh , my god ! I knew it ! One minute with a woman and he short-Circuits . My god , he looks like you ! What did you think he 'd look like , An erector set ? What 's the matter , no man ever lose his head Over you before ? He looks so real . He--He- - He is real ... In his own way . Metal , proteins , synthetic fibers . He 's no different than you or I. What 's that ? That--I-I- - Is his reset button . It reactivates his motor control . I told ramdas that the concept Of a woman would merely confuse him . Ulysses , stop playing games . Ulysse- - Ulysses ! Here . Oh--Uh ! Dr. Ramdas : I thought showing you these tapes Might help to make you more familiar with the droid . You see , miss stone , Programming the android takes him just so far . The rest must be learned Like a human child . We had some difficulty with his gross motor functions Before we modified his cerebral Muscular coordination . Dr. Peters , severely : Edge perception , miss stone , Is extremely difficult . Dr. Peters : It--It may look simple to you , But it really is an incredibly sophisticated Series of programs . Dr. Peters : Once we were able To modify his hand / Eye coordination , We--We realized he had a retinal resolution 10 Times greater than that of the average human eye . Dr. Peters : And as you can see , We licked that problem . Frankie : Well , if all else fails , He can always take your place On jury duty . Men : ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday , dear ulysses ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Ahem . Dr. Peters , He really is an amazing creation , But I think that we might wanna take Some time to polish up his social graces . Social graces ? What for ? Jeff , I 've gotta agree With miss stone . I think a woman would be A good influence on him . Trish ? Hi ! What are you doing here ? Ivy 's wedding isn 't until next week . Oh , trish ... I can 't believe donald would do this to you ! Yeah , my mother was right . I should never have married an actor . Ohh ... What 's going on ? Are you having a garage sale ? Oh , you might call it that . I 'm changing my life , Getting rid of the garbage . Oh , no ! Steve , too ? Mm-Hmm . Jesus , frankie , I always thought steve Was about the best you were gonna do . But it 's nice to know I 'm not the only one Who 's been dragged through the mud By some macho scum . Snowball ! Trish , it wasn 't exactly like that . You know , frankie , Being single again could be really great . I mean , you could go wherever you wanted , Sleep with whoever you wanted , Have absolutely incredible sex With strangers . Like , um ... I 've never made it with a bodybuilder , Have you ? Or an acrobat ? How about a car mechanic ? A sweaty one . I 've never even tried a m age à trois , Have you ? With steve ? Mm-Hmm . Oh , god , it was hard enough To get him alone . Oh . And even then it wasn 't hard enough . Well , frankie , When you think about it ... There are a lot of possibilities . Frankie : Ok ... That 's the first problem . You 've got nice eyes , ulysses , Now use them . Look at me . Why ? I know you 're there . Because looking someone in the eyes Makes them feel that you care About what they 're saying . That 's point number one : Make eye contact . And point number 2 Is listening . Now , you look at a woman , Or anyone , for that matter , And Listen- - As if what they 're saying Is the most important thing in the entire world . Good . Good . Now , point number 3 : Confidence . Just stay there . Stay ... Stay . Yeah ? Woman : Steve marcus is here to see you . Ok , uh , just hold him there , would you ? I 'll be right up . Ulysses , why don 't you watch this For a little while , ok ? They have nobody . Phil donahue : You also are , like- - I 'm very pleased that you would be- - Oh ! Here . Here . This is a talk show . Now , you 're gonna be on one of these In a couple of weeks , So I want you to study , Okey-Dokey ? Okey-Dokey . How ' bout , should you marry , what about children ... I 'll be right back . Biological clock , all that stuff ? Yes , my biologic clock is counting down , And , um , I would like to have children . And , uh , right now , I just try To psych myself out of Not Having children Because I don 't think they 're in my future . Um , are you looking for mr . Right ? Yes . Yes , but- - Isn 't that a trap ? Is there such a person ? P.A. : Attention , welding teams c and d ... Hi . Please report to annex b on c level . What are you doing here ? I have to talk to you ! You won 't return my phone ca- - Shh ! My phone calls ! Here . What happened to your lip ? It 's a mustache . I felt that it would make me Look more mature . Voters like that . Well , I 'm a voter , steve . You don 't like it ? ! Shh ! Why are you here ? Is there someplace a little more private Where we can talk ? Yeah , sure . I 'll walk you to your car . One of the things is that you can 't sit around On your hoopey-Doopey Waiting for mr . Right to come ! Woman : She 's not doing that . Man : Yeah , I know , but you 've gotta get out there , And you 've gotta let yourself be known . You 've gotta say , " here I am , And I 'm worthwhile . " I think a lot of that depends On your own image of your self . If you sit home and turn on the television set , Don 't expect anything to happen ! Get out there and say , " look at me ! I 'm gorgeous ! " Donahue : But the problem is , There aren 't that many other gorgeous , Wonderful people out there ! That 's the problem ! Man : Well , you know , I don 't- - Woman : There are- - There are a lot- - Man : I don 't believe it ! I think there are ! Donahue : All right . Are the--What 's the matter ? Yes , ma 'am , would you kindly stand ? Second woman : Yes , I am a widow . I 've been a widow for 5 Years . And I 've found out the best way And do something for somebody . Donahue : And we 'll be back in just a moment . Man : Aren 't you tired of politicians Who don 't give a damn about what you think ? We are . Who are we ? We 're voters for steven marcus , Believers in a better congress With better congressmen . What makes marcus so much better Than even the so-Called " best " ? He 's sensitive to your needs . I really believe he cares . He 's smart as a whip . He stands for the issues that really matter . Una persona sincera . I think he 's just like you and me , Except he 's a little better . Man : Steven marcus . It takes a man This Sensitive To know your needs . Paid for by citizens for marcus . Donahue : Here 's the point . If you 're looking for mr . Right , Then your well-Being is determined by ... What are you doi- - It takes a man thissensitive To know your needs . My god , that w-Woman Is turning you into a hooker ! Woman : I think that I have a hope That there is a mr . Right out there for me . How you doin ' , skippy ? Is that your new campaign manager ? That 's very funny . Come on , frankie . I need you back on board . Skipper ? Take a break . You know , I 've , uh ... I 've really missed you . I 'm desperate . I fell three points in the polls . My entire career is on the line ! Ok , call the office . Maybe we can recommend somebody . I already have . I mean , I 'm considering , uh- - I 'm considering hiring suzy duncan . You mean my assistant suzy duncan ? Well , why not ? She 's had some good ideas so far . Look , frankie ! Look , you come back ! We can keep it strictly professional . I mean , we can , uh- - We could even date other people ! I mean , I thought that 's what you 'd want ! Isn 't it ? Are you dating other people ? Well , yeah , I mean , you know , Kind of . Aren 't you ? Yeah , sure . Yeah . Yeah . Jesus , that was damn quick work ! We only broke up last tuesday ! What , you keep this guy on a back burner Or something ? Steve ! Well , it got serious pretty goddamned quick ! Look , I don 't have time to get into this right now . I 've gotta go back to work . It 's somebody you work with , right ? See , you never were very good At separating business from pleasure ! I need to speak with you right now . Jeff ! Look , don 't- - Don 't get upset . There 's nothing to be jealous about . I 'm not jealous ! Uh , steve marcus . Jeff peters . Dr. Jeff peters . Well , I hope you 're registered , jeff , Because I 'm gonna be needing You Out there 4 Weeks from tuesday . I don 't follow politics . Sorry , steve . Take good care of him , skippy . Ok ? Bye bye . What Are you doing ? Shh ! You 're my new boyfriend . Miss stone , if I have unwittingly led you on , I sincerely apologize . Don 't flatter yourself . I hate men . Ivy , must you babble like that ? You are going to shave those Before the wedding ? Hector likes me like this . Shaving 's such a bourgeois concept , mom . Marriage is a bourgeois concept , ivy . How come I can 't talk you out of that ? Sorry I 'm late ! Well , you two look adorable . Who 's getting married here , huh ? The wrong person . You could have married the most eligible bachelor In all of miami If you 'd played your cards right , And your sister here insists on marrying a busboy . Hector and I are in love , mom ! What 's love got to do with it ? Frankie and steve had a relationship . It didn 't work out . Did they have to go through a horrendous divorce Like me ? No , they were sensible . They parted as friends . If I never see him again , It will be a day too soon . How about a week from saturday , frankie ? It 's bad enough you asked that creep To the wedding , but , mother , Asking steve to give ivy away ! I certainly did not invite him ! He called ivy , didn 't he , ivy ? You asked him . No , I didn 't ! It was his idea . Well , he said you wouldn 't mind , frankie . Oh , I don 't mind . I just won 't come . No problem ! We 'll call off the wedding ! I 'm happy to lose my deposit ! I 'm getting married , mother ! So , you 're really not gonna come , frankie ? Of course I 'll be there . I 'm a big girl . I 'll come . It 's no big deal . Oh , you 're amazing , frankie . I knew you 'd understand . Mother : Bye , ivy ! Woman : Oh , ho ho ! Bullshit , donny ! Stop seeing that no-Good slut ! ♪ Doo doo doo doo roast beef and salami ♪ Who are you ? Where 's trish ? Moe glickstein , don 's business manager . This is manny our accountant . Are you a friend of trish 's or something ? I happen to live here . Oh ! Oh , very nice place you 've got here ! Sit down , have a nosh . Manny , give her some of your corned beef . Why not ? I 'm not hungry . What 's going on ? My boy donny suddenly announces He 's losing his equilibrium . He can 't sleep , he can 't work . He needs his old lady back . Ah , he 's a Meshugenuh ! Hey , you want a pickle ? Honey , you can 't go up there . Don and trish need their space ! Oh , you 've gotta be kidding me . Honey , calm down ! Here 's $ 20 . I can get you in to tiny tim At the eden roc . It 's a terrific show . What do you say , huh ? Trish : Bullshit , donny ! Ohh ! Oh , ulysses , what are you doing here ? Standing . That 's what I do at night . That 's it ? You don 't ... Read or watch television Or multiply 6-Digit numbers ? No . Ulysses , why are you staring at me like that ? Because you taught me to And because I think you 're attractive . I think you 're the most attractive woman I know . I 'm the only woman you know . But thanks , ulysses . That 's nice . You 're welcome . Frankie , what are You Doing here ? Good question . Ohh , I 'm tired , And I guess I didn 't know where else to go . Jeff taught me to massage the body part When I have a spasm in My Mechanism . Uh ... Oh . Hee hee hee ! Um ... You know , ulysses , You can 't just go grabbing people 's feet like that . Why not ? Well , because it just isn 't done . Why ? Well , um ... You see , there are--Are rules For social behavior , and , um ... Well ... Relationships between people Develop in stages , and ... To get physical with someone , You have to get to know them first . Now , if you don 't mind , I 've had a very long day , And I 'd like to get some sleep . Good night , ulysses . Good night . Good night . What was that ? A kiss . People kiss when they like each other . It 's a sign of love or affection . Although in my case , maybe I 'm going nuts . Now , ulysses , if you don 't mind , Could you just stand out here In the hallway , please ? Sweet dreams . Sweet dreams . Jeff ! Jeff ! Excuse me . Sure . Guess you didn 't see me back there , huh ? Hello , sandra . I told you to call me sandy ! We 're still friends , aren 't we ? I take the blame for everything That happened the other night , But , you know what they say , Getting started 's the hardest part . Look , I 've got a lot of work to do . And I 'm the carefree type , No pressures , no demands , Anything for a laugh . We 're still on for tonight , aren 't we ? Y-Y-Yeah . Yeah . I--I guess so . Ok ! Great ! So ... It 's a date !

This morning , Ulysses met me in- - In that hall , And he kissed me ... Right near my mouth . I guess he likes you , jeff . Um , very funny . Miss stone ? I am not amused . Ulysses is going into deep space . He is going to be alone for 7 Years . He is not going out to discotheques . All right . All right . Jeff ... If you feel you need more time with ulysses- - Yes , I do ! I 'm sure miss stone can reschedule . And , miss stone , please , Try to stick to the essentials . Ok . Oh , and , jeff ...

What are you talking about ? ! Listen ! I 'm sorry to have to tell you this , But you didn 't make love to my cousin . You just made it with my android ! Your what ? Ewwh ! Ewwh ! What are you so happy about ? It 's so beautiful out here , frankie . You know , I 'm really enjoying our date . Let 's get one thing straight , ulysses . This is not a date , ok ? Is that because you 're uptight ? No , I am not uptight ! And who taught you that stupid word ? Trish . That figures . Look , ulysses , I 'm just a little upset right now , ok ? It 's 3 : 00 In the morning , I 'm tired , I haven 't changed clothes for two days , And you 've probably just cost me my job . I 'm sorry , frankie . I mean , what a joke ! Me , trying to turn you into somebody That everybody in america 's supposed To fall in love with . Frankie ? Why do people want to fall in love ? I don 't know , ulysses . You 're asking the wrong girl . Don 't you want to fall in love ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? But , believe me , it 's not that easy . You fall in love with some guy , But he 's in love with somebody else . Or you think you 're in love , But you 're not . Or he thinks he 's in love , but he 's not . Or he was in love , but now he 's not , But now you are . You make it sound so complicated . It Is Complicated . And , ulysses , you should be glad That you 're not human And you don 't have to suffer Through that kind of humiliation . If I were human , frankie , It would be simple . I would be in love with you . You know , frankie , I thought last night was a lot of fun , But I think tonight was even better . I 'm glad You Had fun . I certainly did . Good . Now I want you to go in there And change back into your jumpsuit , And please , ulysses , Don 't say a word about this evening To anyone , ok ? Ok . Ok , good . Good night . Can I keep my tuxedo ? Ok . For now . Does that mean I can go to a wedding ? I 'm sorry , ulysses . Just go change , ok ? Good night . Ulysses : Jeff ? What ? Let 's say there 's this certain person That you really like , But then you have sex with someone else . Now ... A : Do you have to like the person You have sex with ? B : Do you have to have sex With the person you like ? C : Do you have to stop liking The person you like ? " D " - - D ... None of the above . I 'm going to have to change your program . But , jeff , what about babies ? Can I have one ? It is that Woman , Isn 't it ? What has she been teaching you ? ! She 's teaching me about life , jeff , And it 's very interesting , But what I really need to know is , Are love and sex the same thing ? Look , ulysses , I want you to remember That you are much more advanced Than that woman will ever be . Do not let her drag you down to her level ! She lives in an emotional swamp ! But then , so do most people ! Some minor activity occurs in the medulla , And--And wham ! They think they 're in love . The next thing they know , They have 2 Children and a canine . And then , boom ! Some neuron misfires , And they 're divorced , miserable , And only get to see their children on sundays . It is all chemical , ulysses , And it is all a waste of time . You were made for grander things , pal . Do you read me ? Loud and clear , jeff . Good , ulysses . Good . Jeff ? Do you think miss stone has sex appeal ? I do . But steve 's mother said steve said You had a date for the wedding , dear . Frankie : I don 't know what steve 's talking about . Well , according to steve 's mother , He 's not much to look at , but ... I heard he was some sort of doctor . We 're all dying to meet him . Mom , look , I told you I 'm coming alone ! Now , darling , You Are Gonna be able to dig up somebody , Aren 't you ? Now , you don 't want steve To see you there all alone , Do you , dear ? Mom , thanks for the advice . I 've gotta go . Look , I 'll call you when I get home , ok ? Bye . Ohh ! Dr. Peters ? Hi . How did work go today ? Fine . Just ... Great . Oh , good . Ahem . Jeff , um ... I--I don 't want to scare you , Understand that , ok ? But could I ask you something ? Ok . Um ... Well , for , uh , reasons I can 't go into And you don 't wanna know about , I have to go to this ... Wedding , And I need a date , And you 'd be the exact perfect guy . Now , this isn 't a proposition . I just wanna know if you might think about ... Maybe going with me ? A wedding ? Um , I don 't know . I 'm not very good with people . Oh , they 're not people ! They 're just my family . You know , jeff , You 've got really nice eyes . Have you ever considered maybe wearing contacts ? Good night . Frankie : You can pick me up at 4 : 00 At 1313 Southeast 10Th street , Miami beach . Ok ? Thanks so much , jeff . I really appreciate this . Oh , hello . Sandra , I 'm--I 'm sorry about last night . I wasn 't feeling well . Ahem . Shouldn 't you be having your lunch now ? I 'm not hungry . Frankie ! Frankie , come here ! Frankie ! What ? What is it ? That 's her ! That 's the slut that stole donald . I know nothing of the kind . Look me in the eye and say that . Do you want me to list The things we 've done together ? Oh ... Shut up . Oh , my god , they 're frenching ! This is network tv , And they 're using tongues ! That 's got to be against some rule ! Oh , no . No , I can 't . Please stop ! Alessandro , I 'm pregnant . Trish : It better not be donald 's . Is this some trick of yours ? What ? If it is , I 'll slap you . Oh , go ahead and hit me . Do you think that I have any pride left ? Oh ! Mmm ! Oh .

If we ever get back together , I 'm going to hold this against him forever . Look , trish , Don 't use that vcr , ok ? I told you , I 'm sending all of this stuff back tomorrow . Oh , god ! I don 't see why ulysses bought You All this stuff anyone . I 'm the one who slept with him , for christ 's sake . It 's bad enough to be dumped by donald But to be jilted by an android ! Ulysses just thinks I 'm mad at him , And this is his way of apologizing . Hmm . But still ... Why 12 Pairs of the same shoe ? Because he didn 't know your shoe size . He 's so sweet . Mind if I borrow the size 8 ? Hey , frankie , How do you think he manages to buy All this stuff ? Hey , it looks like prom night out here . Come on in . You 're looking spiffy . Hey , trish ! Our escort 's here . Oh . Well , thanks , jeff . It 's , uh ... Oh , a wrist corsage . Very cute . Ah ! Oh , my god ! I can 't believe they look exactly alike ! I know .

Look , jeff , I 'm really sorry about what happened . But I 'm glad he 's fixed and everything 's ok . Who said he was ok ? The papers , the television . Well , he isn 't . He doesn 't work the way he was programmed to . What do you mean ? You don 't even realize the damage you 've done , do you ? I have spent years developing ulysses So he could function in space alone . And now , in less than one month 's time , You have ruined him . Tell me this- - How 's he supposed to survive out there now When all he thinks about is you ? Ready , hon ? We are pleased you could all be here today To meet the ulysses android . The awesome distances involved in the exploration of deep space Have always posed a serious dilemma . How could a man withstand the terrible isolation And confinement ? How could a machine be our eyes and ears ? We believe the ulysses android ... Is the answer . And now , let me introduce Ulysses himself . Hello , I am the ulysses android Developed by dr . Jeff peters at chemtec , And I am here to answer any questions . We 're curious to know what your feelings are Concerning your imminent departure into space . I 'm an android . I don 't have feelings . But it looks like your program Contains a lot of human tendencies . These minor technical errors have been corrected . The question everyone 's dying to ask is , Are you still lovesick ? No . Next question . Aren 't you frightened Going up there alone for seven years ? No . That 's easy . It 's people who are frightening . They walk around hurt and confused and more alone Then I will ever be in space . People can build an incredibly sophisticated space program , And yet they can 't solve their most basic problem- - How to love and care for those who love them . Someday when people have figured that out , They might be more than just machines . Jesus christ ! This guy could run for president . What are you doing here ? I just wanted to tell ulysses good-Bye . I don 't think that 's very appropriate . Do you ? No . Probably not . Man : Minus 10 ... 9 , 8 , 7 , Main engine start , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 ... Liftoff !

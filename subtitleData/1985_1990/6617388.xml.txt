 It looks like the miners ' disease . Run blood tests and keep it between us . I need your help , Mrs Porter . I will try . Can you identify these Newcomers ? No , but my son might . Sykes was the one who chased us and killed Anderson . You 're lucky he didn 't recognise you . What if he talks to Strader ? Mr Strader 's change of heart is dangerous . Find him . You smell like a human . I 'm sorry about your father . Help us find his killers . We can talk outside . I won 't do it ! I can 't let the nightmare start again . I know it 's midnight . Yes , I 'm being careful . The human seems likable . We 'll be working late tonight , so don 't wait up . No . I love you too .

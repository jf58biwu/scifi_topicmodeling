 Supster . Supster . Where are you , now that I really need you ? Aw , Sups , water ? I hate water . Aarrrggghhh . There you are . Sups , water . I could learn to like it . Ooohhh-aaaahhhh . Hahahahahaha . Something else going on here , Lana . You know it . I know it . It 's unavoidable . Only in your dreams , Andy . Wanna talk about dreams ? I had a dream , us , together , on a desert island . Just you and me and ... Clark . Clark . They were all out of grape so I had to get orange . No , orange is just fine . Yeah , great choice there , Clark . I put orange right under lemon-lime , really . Oh , Clark . Oh , I 'm sorry . I was just trying to get my towel . I didn 't mean it . I mean , I didn 't ... Oh , no . Not Mxyzptlk again . What 'd I tell you , Supy ? Trouble . Big trouble . Supy . Put me down . Let me down . Vlkabok , I 'm getting mad . I 'm getting broiling mad . Ohhhh . I don 't believe what I just saw . Oh , my God . Clark , what are we gonna do ? Clark ? Wait . Wait a minute . Maybe this is a dream or something . No . Mxyzptlk is no dream . Trust me . The guy 's been here before . What 's mxyz ... How about that timing ? How did you know ? Mxyzptlk sent me a message . A plea for help . What 's a mxyzptlk ? You know , you should have seen the thing that was after him . No wonder he needs help . An imp ? Worse . A huge giant . I mean it looks like it was about to kill him or something . Fine . I don 't care . I don 't wanna know . I don 't need this . I am out of here , o-u-- - Whoa . I 'm back . All right , Mxyzptlk , what 's it this time ? Not even a hello ? A how are you ? How you doing ? Can I lend a hand ? I 'm disappointed , Supy . I came down to this dimension , I thought you were the one guy who cared about the little fella . So , this is Mxyzptlk . What a geek . Andy , I wouldn 't do that . Hey , nice outfit , pal . Who took a bite out of your hat ? Oh , yeah . Aaaahhh . Aaahhh . Anyway , El Supo . I got this problem ... And here comes this problem . You look very nice in a dress . Hahaha . That 's very funny . Now where did Superboy go ? Are you guys all right ? Last thing I remember , I was in that cabana over there . And Mxyzptlk must have zapped me . Zapped you ? Zapped you ? Look at me . Andy , Andy , wait . Look , let me just tell you something . See , where this guy comes from , they all have these magical powers . And they can do just about anything . Really ? This hair is real . Mxyzptlk . Mxyzptlk , when I find you , I 'm gonna crush your bones into a fine , powdered ash . Mxyzptlk , are you in there ? Mxyzptlk . Mxyzptlk . Mxyzptlk , are you under there ? Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , pal , that 's my truck . My name is not pal . I am Vlkabok . I hope you got insurance , because this is gonna cost you plenty , you big oaf . I am big . But I am no oaf . You are a big tomato . Aaahhhh . Hahahaha . Mxyzptlk . You know it took that guy almost two hours to cut my hair and get it back in shape . And then three guys tried to pick me up on the way there . God , Clark , you really let this place go . Hey listeners , get a load of this . We just had a report on the wire that a building on the corner of orange and sixth street has just disappeared , can you dig that ? They even got eye witnesses verifying the building seemed to vanish into thin air . We 're not saying we believe it 'til we see it . But in this case- - imagine that , huh ? Police are checking out the story . A building up and disappears . Now back to another six pack of rock rules . Hey , you think it has anything to do with that Mxyzptlk guy ? Look , Andy , I gotta run for a second . If you talk to Lana , would you tell her that I have to talk to her tonight . Okay ? Clark . I hate to break this to you so fast . But I finally broke Lana down and she 's going to a movie with me tonight . Clark . Clark ? Excuse me , Officer , may I pass through ? Sure thing , Superboy . Mxyzptlk , where are you ? Right over here , my blue-suited friend with the red cape . So what 's been keeping you ? You know , it 's no fun being pursued by this thing that looks like a locomotive . Mxyzptlk , this building is gone . Oh , yeah , well , I been meaning to replace it . But I think the doors are in Pittsburgh . This bully , Vlkabok , he must be really mad at you . Mad at me ? That doesn 't even say it . Really furious says it better . Hah . Any reason ? Well , I just played this little practical joke on him . I took away everything he had and I put him on his desert island for 103 human years . And I gave him a bad case of athlete 's foot . So Vlkabok wants revenge . You gotta help me , Supy . Come on . Please . All right , I will . Providing we can reverse everything that Vlkabok 's done in this dimension . Oh , okay . So we got a deal . That Vlkabok can 't touch a nymph from the fifth dimension who becomes a citizen in this dimension . And I figured out how we 're gonna do that . Know what it is ? You and Lana gotta become my mom and dad . Dad . No . No . I ... This is totally insane . Gee , my little gal pal . It 's not my fault . I was born in the fifth dimension and an imp . I 'm supposed to create havoc . The only way we 're gonna get rid of both of them , is by playing along . We 've gotta become parents . Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . We better hurry up or vlkabok 's gonna destroy half the city . He 's kidding , right ? I mean look at this place . Mxyzptlk has some interesting taste . I 'm a little scared . Think this is really gonna work ? My powers aren 't that useful against magic . And this Vlkabok is even more powerful than Mxyzptlk . Dad 's home . Dad 's home . Dad , Dad , can you pick me up , please , Dad , please , Dad . I love you so much , Dad . I 'm so glad you 're home . Oh , Dad . I love Mom , too . Mom , I love you so much . And I wanna kiss you all over your face . Wait a minute . Isn 't this supposed to be done in front of Vlkabok ? Vlkabok , yes . And I invited him over here . And please , Mom and Dad , please let him come over . I don 't know if I can put up with this . Well , you 're gonna have to because you don 't wanna see me fed to the goldfish and cut up in little pieces and thrown in a pond , do you ? He 's here . Ready or not , here he comes . Where is he ? There he is . Hey , I came to play . My bestest pal , in the whole world , Vlkabok . Vlkabok , come meet my mom and dad . Mr. and Mrs. Superboy . Dad , tell Vlkabok how you take me to ball games . You know . And how you shoot baskets with me . And how you , you know , break anybody 's neck who messes with me . Well , are you sure that that 's your mom and dad ? Then why isn 't Superboy kissing your mom ? They always kiss . Don 't you , Mom and Dad ? Sure we do . See , now you can go home , Vlkabok . But , but I 'm hungry . I wanna stay over . Okay . And I eat a lot . He eats a lot , Mom and Dad . Oh , that will be just fine . Mom , Mom , can I set the table ? That would be nice , honey . Thank you . Vlkabok , get a load of this . Neat , huh ? Mxyzptlk , that 's not the kind of table manners - we accept in this house . - Oh , yeah . You behave or I 'm gonna send you to your room without dinner . Dad , don 't embarrass me in front of my friend , Vlkabok . Why this sure is good , Mrs. Superboy . Thank you , Vlkabok . That is if you really are Mrs. Superboy . Dad , can me and Vlkabok go watch TV ? It 's okay with your mother , go ahead , boys . How much longer do we have to put up with this ? Until Vlkabok is completely convinced that we 're Mxyzptlk 's parents . Sonny , where are you ? I 'm calling Sonny . Sonny . Hahahaha . Ho ho . Isn 't great just to be good friends ? Just best buddies , huh ? And to think an hour ago , I was gonna kill you very painfully . Hahaha . Isn 't this nice honey , watching TV with our son and his best friend ? Can I sleep over ? Well , I don 't know if your parents would approve , Vlkabok . No , it 's no problem . Because for about 50 years , I 've had them locked up in a cellar . With thousands of bugs and snakes . Okay . In that case , it 's fine . Oh , thank you , Mr. Superboy . Okay , Mom , I 'm coming to kiss you goodnight . Bye , Mom . Me and Vlkabok are gonna go upstairs under the covers with a flashlight and read the comic books . Andy . So , looks like you guys had a big party . And when it came time to write the invitations , I was just overlooked . Andy , this is not a good idea . I been looking for you all over . I saw your car outside . I thought we were gonna see a movie tonight . But I guess she had other plans , didn 't she , Superboy . Ho , what this guy again . Are you their son , too ? Chief , if I play my cards right , this red-headed bombshell is gonna be my date , comprendez ? But she 's married to him . Oh , big guy . Nothing 's a little bit mixed up here . See , these two are just friends . Platonic friends . Oh , now I 'm getting very angry and ashamed of all of you . You lied to me . But I 'm very happy . Because now I get to kill him . Many , many , many , many times . Uh-oh . Look , I can see it 's probably the wrong time . And I 'm probably bugging you , so why don 't I just amscray , huh ? You 're right . You are a bug . Andy . Hahahaha . Hohohoho . No , you don 't . Andy . There he is . Got him . Just kidding . Uh-oh . I think Supy 's cooked . Vlkabot 's using his full magical power . Well , you gotta help him . Please . Well , I 'll do the best I can . I 'm gonna really kill you now . Superboy , you did it . With a little help from my magic . Yeah , but we still have the problem of getting this big guy back into the fifth dimension . We gotta get him to say his name backward . I got a plan . Vlkabok , you 're in big trouble now . The Kobaklvs are after you . The who ? The Kobaklvs . What are you deaf ? What 's a Kobaklv ? There . I got him to say his name backwards . Now all the damage he 's done , has gone back to normal . You proud of me , Sup ? I 'll be proud of you when you 're gone . Which is gonna be now . Aw , Sup , that means I gotta wander around for 90 days in the fifth dimension . Vlkabok might be after me again . That 's a chance you 're gonna have to take . We did our part . Okay , okay . I do owe you one . Well , sweetie , next time you 're in the fifth dimension , look me up . Kltpzyxm . I 'm ... Andy , Andy , I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? Hahaha . Hahahaha . Captioned by Grant Brown

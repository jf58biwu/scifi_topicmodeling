Fantastic ! I thought they grew that way ! Door ! Forrester ! Forrester ! Come on out ! Forrester , if you won 't think of yourself , think of the boy ! Watch it back there ! Gone ! Why are we doing this ? I don 't know . I saw it on TV once . Paper ! Paper here ! Good morning ! Good morning . ( ¡ Eh , Mario ! ¡ Ayúdame con esto aquí ! ) How 'd you sleep ? Are you kidding ? Come on , let 's go . We 're gonna have to be careful . Where will we go now ? We gotta find a way of getting out of town , safely , without getting caught . Fox is probably watching for us . I hate this . I hate what will happen if they catch us . She appears normal , except for her insistence , that she has born a child fathered by an alien from another planet . The only available picture of the woman whose name is Jennifer Hayden , is over then years old . Officials said the Hospital are afraid she 'll wind up on skid row , as do so many who can 't take care of themselves . They ask all citizens to contact them immediately , should anyone spot her . Remember , she 's not dangerous , except possibly to herself . Jennifer Hayden ! I mean it 's my mum ! It 's the same picture , right ? Isn 't it ? Yes ! Where do we start ? Ahm ... Phone book ! We gotta get the address to the hospital . Scott , she 's not in the hospital . Right , erm ... I 'm not thinking straight here , What are we gonna do ? I got an idea . Did you want to see me ? Yes , can we talk to you for a second ? About what ? The woman in your news program . In the hospital ? What about her ? She 's my mother . We 've been looking for her for a long time . I thought you might some more information It was named in your newscast . I 'm sorry , I don 't . The hospital called the newsroom with the information and we sent someone over for the picture . Well , couldn 't you tell us where she might be ? I 'm sorry . Thank you anyway . Just a minute ! Why don 't you try the Sunrise House ? It 's a halfway house in Hollywood . Thank you What is it ? I hope we don 't find her . Not here , I don 't want to find her here . ( Now you just stay right here and walk ) ( That 's it ! There you go ) Hello ! Hi ! They get frightened sometimes . They 're used to the hospital and when they leave , the outside world can be a scary thing . Can I help you with something ? We 're looking for this woman . D 'you know her ? What do you want with her ? Do you mean you know her ? Where are you from ? Do you have some sort of identification ? I 'm Paul Forrester , this is my son Scott . Please lady , she 's my mum .

I said I did . Oh my goodness ... It 's OK ! It 's alright . Sorry . We 've been looking for her for a long time . I understand , of course I understand . Do you know where she is ? It 's not a very good picture , is it ? It 's old . She gave it to me ... last time I saw her . I guess she looks different now . We all change a little bit . Why don 't I just go tell them I 'm leaving ? Let 's go some place where we can talk . Is my mother , erm ... You know , like one of them ? What do you mean ? Well , on television they said that she talked about a man from another world , and the child that she had with him . I know , Jenny talks about because she believes it because with Jenny it 's the truth . You probably know more about that than I do . Every woman has a romantic fantasy . It 's a woman 's secret . Jenny and I shared a great deal but , we both had our secrets . So , can you take us to my mum now ? Jenny ? I wish I could . I though you said you knew Jenny Hayden . I do know her ! I just don 't know where she is . What do we do now ? Well look , Hollywood is not that big a place if you know where you 're looking . We 'll go talk to people and go to places that Jenny liked to go , What places ? I know all the places that Jenny liked because they 're my places too . We go to all of them until we ... Until we find her ! Let 's go ! ( ... . she 'll wind up on skid row , as do so many who can 't take care of themselves ... ) How often do they run ? All day , starting with the morning news . They must have seen it . They must ... ! - Ha , ha , ha - Hi ! How are you ? Good , good ! Paul come on over , This is Mr Romero , the owner . Are you two staying over at Sunrise House ? No , no , they 're just friends . What can I do for you , Angie ? Not for me , for them . They 're looking for Jenny Hayden . You haven 't seen her , have you ? I 'm sorry , she hasn 't been in . Are you sure ? I 'd remember ! I know most of Angela 's friends . Don 't I , honey ? I guess you do . Well , thanks anyway , If you see her , leave a message for me at Sunrise House . Try and get her to call me if you can but you know how she is sometimes . Bye ! ¡ Buenos días ! ¡ Adiós ! ¡ Buenos días ! ( ¡ Carlos , dame una mano con esto ! ) ( ¡ Venga niños ! ) What do we do now ? I guess we should find some place to get some sleep . If you don 't mind furnished rooms I know a good place where they usually have one . Wait a minute ! You know where my mum is going to sleep You saw she was on skid row , like she could be sleeping on a doorway or something . Besides , I 'm not tired . ( ¡ Coge el libro ! ) Looks like he was tired after all . Poor kid , he 's exhausted . I 'm tired too . I was just thinking , There are places near here that Jenny liked to go to , chances are she 'll be drawn to a familiar place , you know ? memories ? He 's fast asleep . Alright , but I don 't wanna be gone too long . What a beautiful , clear night . The stars seem so close . It 's as if we were right in the middle of them . Sometimes I pretend that I could just fly away among the stars , don 't you ? Sometimes . Anyway , Jenny 's the same way , isn 't she ? She used to look at the stars for hours and hours . Tell me more about her . What did she looked up at the stars ? Was she sad ? Yes , oh , so sad . Yeah , sometimes , she would cry and I would just , hold her for the longest time . Are you the one who made her so unhappy ? I don 't know . I believe I made her unhappy when I left . Why did you leave her ? What did she tell you ? Only that you left . I had to . We couldn 't be together anymore . I left her . but I took her with me . Here . Poor Jenny . Poor Paul . Poor Angela . Come on ! Here you go , Sir , the best seat in the house . What is this place ? It 's a magic place . " I 'm made of that self mettle as my sister and prize me at her worth in my true heart , I find she names my very deed of love Only she comes too short , that I profess myself an enemy to all other joys which the most precious square of sense possesses , and find I am alone felicitate in your dear Highness ' love . " Don 't I get a hand ? Sure ! Ha , ha ! I 'm sure that was amusing in the sixth grade , but right now , it would surely be pleasant to hear the sound of at least one pair of hands smacking together . Thank you ! Is that what you do ? Up on the stage ? Did you know the whole world is staged and the people on it are just players ? Guess who said that ? You did ! Just now ! You are so weird ! But you are just so delightfully weird . It was him ! Billy Shakespeare ! Is he your friend ? Can you tell ? It 's my first love , my true love , the closest to my heart . I have a gift , they said , a gift for theater . I think that without " make-believe " this whole world would just dry and blow away , don 't you ? I don 't know . And Jenny ? Did she also like the stage ? Who ? Oh ! Oh my ! Shame on me ! I was just having a wonderful close moment with you that I just forgot , I 'm ... You don 't hate me , do you ? No ! I mean , here I am trying to help you find your one true love and ... After all this time I wonder if she still looks the same . I remember what Jenny was like , how she looked , the way her voice sounded ... Was she good on stage ? Jenny was fabulous ! They said she and I were like sisters , only she was a professional , like me , she was , erm , you know , little theater . ( ... and in tennis , though no one was surprised , Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert-Lloyd both advanced to the semi-finals ... ) ( and that 's sports ) ( back to you , Johnny ) ( Before we wrap up tonight 's National Desk here 's Anne Nishakura with an update ) ( Thanks John ) ( There 's a happy ending to the story of the patient who walked away from Lindero Hospital this morning . It seems that tonight she 's turned in a bad face , At approximately 8 : 30 this evening , the woman , Jennifer Hayden , walked up to the gate at the medical facility through the main entrance and asked to be readmitted . Her reason for walking away last night ? She wanted pistachio ice cream . A flavour the hospital cafeteria doesn 't stock . A spokesman for the hospital asked us to express gratitude to any of our viewers who may have called ) ( John ? ) ( Well as Shakespeare pointed out : " All 's well that ends well " ) The boy 's coming in , this is Fox , the boy 's coming in . No sign of Forrester , what do we do ? We wait ! What good it 'll do to you ? What ? If you get out of here ? They 'll just bring you back . You run away from home ? They bring you back . You run away from here , they bring you back . Life 's just one big yo-yo , man . I 'm looking for someone . A patient . Where can I find out what room she 's in ? Get me out of these and I 'll take you there . OK , Bobby ! Time to sign you in again . Who are you talking to ? Just nobody . I was talking to myself . Can I help you , son ? I 'm looking for a patient . Well , it 's way past visiting hours . Her name is Jenny Hayden . Jenny Hayden ? Yeah , and I 'm not leaving til I see her , so , maybe I should talk to whoever is in charge of this place . Well , I 'm Eddie . Who are you ? Scott . OK , Scott . Come on with me . We 'll see what we can do . Jenny Hayden , huh ? Yeah . Is that with a " Y " ? Is it without a " Y " ? It 's with . Look , maybe I should come back tomorrow during visiting hours . That 's kind of silly , I mean , You 're already here . Here you are , come on . How long do I have to wait to see ... Hey ! Hey , Eddie ! Hey pal ! Let me out ! Hey ! I don 't know about this ... You promised there wouldn 't be any disruptions of my staff and no upset to the patients . I know what I 'm doing . I certainly hope so . I guess he 's still asleep . Didn 't I tell you ? Don 't you remember ? You know of any other places Jenny might be ? No , I just know the places that she loved . There must be some others . Of course there are ! You know Jenny . I didn 't ... really know her so well . Well , actually , I did . In three days I learnt so much . Look what we found about each other in just a few short hours . I haven 't seen her in 14 years . Must have been a wild three days . For you to care is such a strong love all this time . I don 't know how strong the love is . I think I 'll know that when I see her . You mean that ... I 've got a chance ? A chance for what ? Ahmm ... I 'll tell you the truth , and I don 't blame you if you hate me . But ... I haven 't felt this way for someone since ... well , I ... I really can 't remember when . Maybe it was 14 years ? Maybe longer ? Maybe I 've never felt like this for somebody . Look , what I 'm trying to say is , erm ... Would you be unhappy if I left ? Angela , I ... Scott ? He 's not here . Well , bathroom is just down the hall . Wait a minute ! He 's at the hospital . This is wonderful . Will you go with me ? Show me where it is ? Sure ! Why not ? I 'll be happy to . I 'll never forget you . And I 'll never forget you . Come on . Come on ! Open up ! I did it . Hello Scott . I 'm George Fox . I know . What do you want ? Ha , ha , well ... Everyone tells me that you are a very bright boy , Scott I 'm sure that you can figure out an answer to that question . No ! I just came to check this place out , really . Well , maybe when your Dad gets in here , he can fill you in on what you don 't know . I haven 't seen my Dad in a long time . He just took off , he just split one day , I don 't know where he is . Yes , you do , Scott . And so will I very soon . But until he gets here , I suppose that you and I get acquainted . What ? What is it ? Shhh ! Someone 's after you . It 's a man from the government . Why ? What have you done ? He 's not after me because I did something . I can 't tell you that . It 's true , isn 't it ? What Jenny said , about you and about Scott . Jenny and I were only together for a short time but ... we learnt to trust each other . Can you ? Yes , yes ! Of course ! I would do anything to protect you ! How can I help ? You know where Jenny 's room is ? Yes , of course I do . I can 't just walk in through the front door . You don 't have to . Jenny 's very clever about things she 's a survivor , I doubt a thing in the whole place knows about this but her . Where will it come out ? Boiler room , main building . And then ? Up to the first floor , find the corridor with the TV room , follow up to the end and then up the stairs . Where 's Jenny 's room ? Second floor , a little up the hall , left side . - Angela . - No . Listen , there 's a lot more that I could say , but , I think you get the idea . Go to her . She 's waiting for you . ( Man it seems like a quiet night ) ( I hope you 're right , remember I 've been working double shifts ) ( Doctor Owers , to administration , please ) ( Doctor Owers ) - Good evening . - Doctor . - Seems like a quiet night - I hope so . - I 've been working a double shift . - A lot of us have ! Station E ? Station E ? Secure ! Stay on top of it , E. - Station F ? - All clear ! OK , good . Everybody eaten ? Yes , Sir , everybody but you . I will , I 'm gonna check the perimeter again . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? I 'm looking for my son . No ! You 're not ! The truth ! I 'm telling the truth . You 're gonna be here a long time . ( Go ! , Go ! Go that way ! ) He did ! Why do you let strangers in the hall next to us ? He had no business in here ! Calm down ! What are you going to do about it ? What is that thing ? It 's helping me find my son . I 've seen him earlier . He 's down there now . And I think he 's in danger . Wait ! In here . Where are we ? Shhh . Is that him ? Yes . That agent 's got him , doesn 't he ? Yes . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know yet . Where are you going ? No place ! You can do things with that ? Then why don 't you kill him ? Don 't be silly . I don 't wanna harm anyone , I just want my son back . It 's not bad . In fact , it 's kind of neat . Only now what ? There 's no knob on the inside of that door . Hey ! Hey ! Come back ! Come back ! Mister Fox ! Mister Fox ! Help ! Mister Fox ! I can 't believe they wouldn 't let me talk to her . They wouldn 't even let me see her ! Mom ? Scott ? Is that really you ? Scott ! Don 't ! Paul ! I thought I 'd never see you again . Oh , Scott ! Come here ! Let me look at you ! What is she doing ? Does she think it 's a joke or something ? Angela ! Where is Jenny ? Darling ! Don 't you recognize me ? I recognize Angela . Don 't be silly ! Angela 's gone . You know how she is , a butterfly one minute , sun beam the next . Tell her to stop ! Tell her to make it stop ! Scott ! She 's making believe ! Pretending ! But she doesn 't know that now . Don 't you understand ? No ! I don 't understand ! She told me all the world was a stage . Do you see ? Everything that we 've said about your mother , is a part of her now . Scott ! I don 't want to say good-bye . I had to . Don 't you see ? Then where 's my mother ? I don 't know . Not here . She probably never was here . It was all ... a trick ? Paul ? Scott ? Let me help you . The whole thing was a trap ? To catch us . But it caught Angela too . A long time ago , didn 't I help you then ? Didn 't I ? When we couldn 't be together anymore ? Remember ? Let me help you now . I remember . OK ? So much for a quiet shift . You never know what 's gonna set them off , tonight it was some stranger in the rec room . What ? A stranger in the rec room . - What did he look like ? - Who ? The stranger ? I don 't pay any attention . We have stuff like that all the time . The difference was , this guy was supposed to be able to unlock doors by putting his hand on . David ! David ! God ! Who are you ? I 'm Bobby ! Who are you ? They 've both left the building now . Now where did they go ? Where 'd who go ? The alien ! The alien and his son ! If I was you I wouldn 't talk like that in here . Get that idiot out of there ! And start checking the rooms ! All the rooms ! Angela . Jenny ! Thank you , Jenny . It 's like before . I have to let you go so you 'll be safe . But it hurts as much this time as it did before . Better get going . Paul ? Take me with you , here . I will . Thank you ! Now you ! Good-bye , Scott . Take care of your Dad . I 'm kind of glad we didn 't find mom back there . Wherever she is , I hope she 's not locked up in some place . She could be in a nice house . Yeah , with flowers all around . Up on hill ? Looking out for miles ? She could have someone to love her , to take care of her . She could be hiding up some place really terrible . Maybe she 's still on the run . Like us . Sleeping outside in the cold , in the rain ... Right now she probably needs us more than ever . Wherever she is , we 'll find her .

 What a sorry sight . You have just witnessed the obliteration of an elite U.S. Army tank force a mere three minutes after being engaged in the city 's streets by the Slave Trooper 01 . Also known as the MADOX-01 , its localized combat capability is overwhelming . The device is also more resistant to NBC weaponry than a main battle tank . ( NBC : Nuclear Biological Chemical ) Furthermore , it can be deployed from a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter . Its utility for anti-terrorist and anti - guerrilla operations is self-evident . Now , allow me to introduce the driver of the MADOX , who just performed this dangerous exercise with these remote simulator tanks ... Miss Kusumoto . Miss Kusumoto is also in charge of soft - ware development for this " Tankbuster . " In order to demonstrate the versatility of the MADOX she personally volunteered to be the driver today , despite being a woman . Unit # 1 goes to Ichigaya tonight . We 're in a hurry , so deliver it as-is . Unit # 2 needs to be overhauled . Get started quickly . And then ... Miss Kusumoto you humiliated me brilliantly today . Lt. Kilgore , you fought admirably in today 's action but you just can 't beat the MADOX in street warfare . I didn 't come to talk about that . I have only one thing to tell you : I 'll get even for today . I swear it . Not with you ... with that wind-up toy . Remember this ... next time , it won 't be a remote-control game . Hey ! This is terrible ! What is it ? Over there ! Holy Cow ! Hey , that 's an E-2C Hawkeye ! It 's flying pretty low ... Kouji ... Sorry to bother you , but ... Have you got something interesting ? Daydreaming again , aren 't you ? Must be nice to work part-time . Never mind that ! What is it ? What 's this ? I have no idea . All of a sudden it was here in the truck . It wasn 't here when I loaded up . Say , what do you think it is ? Kouji ... aren 't you an engineering major ? Okawasaki Heavy Industry ... U.S. Army ... Onose , I 'll take charge of this ! Huh ? But ... Well , then , what is it ? It has " MADOX " written on it , right ? It 's just a piece of junk someone threw away . - I 'm telling you , don 't worry about it . - Uh , but ... I treat you to ramen all the time , don 't I ? Cheater ! Sign : " Onose Motors " This is absolutely unthinkable ! How could an SDF transport ... ( SDF : Self-Defense Force ; Japan 's military ) ... lose top-secret cargo in such a stupid traffic accident ? Er ... The report said that it was an unavoidable ... You 're being naive . It was terrorism , of course . You people don 't know the Eastern Bloc 's methods . Hey , if the Eastern Bloc does get hold of it we 'll expect you to reimburse us for the enormous development expenses we 've incurred as per our contract ... Mr. Okawasaki ! You , too , should watch what you say ! Another viewpoint is that this accident was one of your publicity stunts ! Wh ... What are you saying ? We 're the victims ! In any case , this couldn 't come at a worse time . We were just about to go into field-testing ! It 's terrible ! Really , they 're missing the point ! It 's been fourteen hours since the accident and yet the top brass are still in a panic . The actual loss aside , I 'm to blame for leaving it in scramble mode while it was being moved . I 'll bring it down if it starts operating . The Army 's already trying to recover it . It 's best that you leave it to us . Besides , MADOX-02 is being overhauled right now . Any new movements ? No . There 's still nothing from the SDF search troops . We 're having trouble tracking down vehicles that were at the scene . And we can 't very well ask the Police for assistance , now , can we ? We 're preparing for the worst , and forming a recovery unit . - Did you say " a recovery unit ? " - That 's me . - Lt . Kilgore ? - Surprised ? But after all , I 'm the only one who 's fought against the MADOX ... That 's too dangerous . There 's nothing to worry about . Our objective is recovery . I won 't break it . You still don 't understand , do you ? It 's you I 'm worrying about ! Awfully sure of yourself , aren 't you ... Well , fine . I 've got a trump card too . Lt. Kilgore is a dangerous man , but he 's the best tank driver in the Army . He was born into the wrong era , I fear . Say , will this be all right ? It won 't drop through the floor , will it ? Well , this apartment was built a long time ago ... Don 't scare me like that ! It looks all right now ... Hey , what 's this photo , Kouji ? Didn 't you say you broke up with Shiori ? Hey , you , cut that out ! Give that back ! Man ... Shiori is too pretty for words . When she goes off to study in England every guy in Japan is going to be miserable ! How do you know about that ? Eh ? Oh , didn 't I tell you ? She called this morning and asked me to give you a message . Why didn 't you tell me sooner ? Now you 're crying over spilled milk ! Didn 't you break up with her ? Just tell me what she said ! She said , " I 'll be waiting on the observation floor ... " " ... of the NSR Building in West Shinjuku , at 8 . : 00 tonight . " Say , Kouji , you 've been saying that you were breaking up but isn 't it ultimately up to you ? Shiori thinks ... Uh , never mind ... Sorry ... Well , I still have work to do but tell me if you find anything interesting in there , okay ? Well , so long ! Now , then ... A manual ... " The Slave Trooper MADOX-01 . " What is this ? I see ... Awesome ! To get inside press the Open Switch . This is hot ! I get excited just looking at it . I 'm amazed that something like this already exists . Ah ... The joints get locked when the power unit is turned off . I wonder if it has an escape mechanism of some kind ... Maybe I can even make it move ! I don 't get this ... Oh ... okay ! It can adjust to your body size . Let 's see ... About this much ? Feels just like wearing ski boots ! What now ? How do I get out of this thing ? Wh ... Wh ... What the ... ? ! Stop ! Hold it , stupid ! I ... I 'm not ready yet ! Stop ! What 's happening ? - We 've got the MADOX 's activation signal . - Where ? Tokyo ! Nakano district ! So , it 's moved . It 's heading toward Shinjuku ! This is a disaster . It won 't stop ! W ... Where 's the brake ? ! Here ! L ... Looks like I 've stopped . Uh ... Excuse me ... ? Huh ? Ah , yes ! I 'll take this , please ! Can you warm it up in the microwave ? Damn it ! Come on , shrimp ! That 's it ... a little ... more ! Honestly , this is like feeding myself with someone else 's hands ! Still , this is really embarrassing ! This thing just sucks me in , and I can 't figure out how to get out ! The NSR Building at 8 . : 00 , wasn 't it ? Shiori ... " Foreign-exchange study ? " " In England . For three years . " " What are we gonna do for three years ? " " That 's why I want to talk to you about it . " " Talk ? What 's there to talk about ? " " My father is making me go . " " So that 's how it is , huh ? It 's not hard to figure it out . " " I 'm just a poor student who has to work for a living , after all ... " " So when are you leaving ? " " This Sunday . " " That 's only four days from now ... " " In other words , we 're finished ! " Shiori , what do you want ? Heck , seeing as how I 'm all dressed up I might as well go and find out . What 's with the Marines ? They 're going up the Tama River ? They 'll miss the show ! The Self-Defense Forces ? The Self-Defense Forces , let me see ... have them direct traffic ! Lt. Kilgore ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Well , well . If it isn 't Miss Kusumoto . Do you intend to start a war ? Taking off in a prototype airborne tank ... Please don 't turn Tokyo into another Vietnam ! Tokyo or Vietnam , it 's all the same battlefield to me . It 's the perfect jungle in which to blow away your pretty MADOX . It 'll be a catastrophe . Hey , don 't worry . I 'll knock it out and keep this affair from escalating . Let 's go ! Scramble and take off ! Lt. Kilgore has taken off on the MADOX recovery mission with a high-mobility airborne tank and anti-tank helicopters ! What did you say ? That 's going too far ! As it stands , the heart of the city will be in a huge panic . It may be that nobody will be able to stop Kilgore and the MADOX . Is there anything we can do ? The MADOX 's goal is as yet unknown . We simply can 't read the driver 's actions . But if I can reach him before Lt. Kilgore does , I think we 'll have a chance . But , the MADOX is ... I 'll take Unit # 0 , from the motive-power test bed . Is there any chance of success ? I don 't know . But we have no choice ! Come on , you heard me ! I want diesel ! Fill ' er up ! Fill ' er up ! All right ! I 'm coming , Shiori . Wait for me ! Cool ! What a ride ! Hey , what 're you doing ? I don 't put up with weirdos hogging the road ! Get out of the way , you jerk ! Watch this ! You 're really hot , man ! It was easy ! Huh ... ? Stop it ! Stop it ! I still got 30 more loan payments to make ! Oh ! My top ! All right ! It 's a Cabriolet now ! So long , suckers ! Oh yeah , cars are not allowed in some areas of Shinjuku on Saturdays . What 's with these guys ... ? Oh ... Oh no ! Yes , we 're certain . Shinjuku 5-chome intersection . Request back-up . I can 't cut loose in this crowd ! They 've come to take this sucker back ! This is getting serious ! This " MADOX " must really be important . What is that ? It 's weird . Is this a TV show ? I hope it 's not a Yakuza war ! But what am I supposed to do when I can 't even get out of it ? Get out of my way , blockheads ! I just want to go to the NSR Building ! You got that ? Jackal 3 to Spider 1 . We 've acquired the MADOX . Spider 1 to Jackal 3 . Attack ! Fire at will ! It 's still moving ! The right arm 's moving on its own ... STOP ! It wasn 't me ! It did that on its own ! I 'm telling you , it wasn 't me ! One of the Apaches was shot down . The full unit has authorization to destroy the MADOX ! That 's just what Kilgore wants . What about the MADOX ? It 's heading towards the skyscrapers with the Apaches in pursuit . Evacuate the civilians , quickly ! I 'm going in ! They 're ganging up on me ! Oh ! Over there ! Look out below ! Shiori ... it looks like I 've gotten mixed up in something really awful . Now , then ... Which way to the NSR Building ? Now this is convenient ! By going straight this way , I should come out at the West Entrance . When I do , it 'll be right in front of me ! Another lunatic 's popped up ! Back off ! Sign : No Smoking in the Subway ! I 've found the West Entrance . That 's the building ! Oh Shit ! Okay , move it , MADOX ! You should be able to hear this . Answer me ! I can hear you . You 're giving me a headache ! What the hell are you trying to accomplish by causing all this uproar ? You 're the ones who are causing an uproar ! I 'm just ... " Just ... " what ? None of your business . Give up , anyway . You can 't escape now . That 's something I won 't know if I don 't try ! Great ! Damn it ! That does it ! I 'm taking you with me ! The NSR Building ? You 're sure that 's what he said ? All right , Captain ! We 've got our drop site . Put me down in front of the NSR Building ! Make it smooth . I 'm springing for a 12-pack of Bud . It 's the perfect ring for a return match . Sign : " NSR Building Parking Area - - Exit Elevator " All right ! Shiori 's up there ! Shit ! Persistent , aren 't you ? I won 't let you go any further ! Damn it ! I don 't want anything more to do with you ! I thought you were an amateur but it looks like I don 't need to treat you like one anymore ! Get back ! O ... Out of ammo ! That 'll do . It 's time we stopped playing around . Why , you ! Give it up ! I can 't move ! I ... I 'm dead for sure ! It can 't be ! He 's just a boy ! Who are you ? What do you hope to accomplish by this ? I 'm Sugimoto Kouji , a sophomore at Kanto Institute of Technology . I just want to meet a girl who 's waiting for me atop the NSR Building . What 's that got to do with anything ? Listen to me . This thing is what 's causing all the commotion ! It swallowed me up , and then it shot up a helicopter , all on its own ! I understand . Your carelessness is not inconsequential but I 'm also largely to blame , for letting it be transported in scramble mode . Miss Kusumoto , this is Spider 1 , Kilgore here . Too bad you won 't get your chance . Yeah , thanks for the show . As always , you fought well . Come up here , on the double . I 'll make the pickup . Thank you , but I won 't be turning him over to you . I 'll settle this personally with Yokota Base Headquarters . Okay , fine . Do what you like . Hey , where are the civilians in this building ? They 're only on the top floor , sir . Say , do you suppose you could take me up to the 50th floor for a bit ? Is it that important ? Now that you mention it , why am I getting so frantic ? " ... isn 't it ultimately up to you ? " First floor . Wha ... What the ... ? It 's a trap ! Fire ! As you ordered , sir , we 've taken care of the bigger one ! But ... are you sure that was the right thing to do ? It 's fine . Are you all right ? What the hell is going on ? That was naive of me . He intends to see this through to the bitter end . His target is the MADOX . He 'll come after you until he destroys it . If you want to stay alive , you 'll have to beat Kilgore . With your MADOX . Th ... That 's impossible ! I can 't do it ! I barely know how to walk and move the hands ! You 've got to do it ! Either the MADOX gets destroyed , or you crush Kilgore ! There are no other options . What about you ? They wrecked my legs . I can 't move at all . Who is this Kilgore guy ? You 'll understand when you meet him . You think I can take him ? With your MADOX , you should be able to . You were excellent in our fight . Have you read the entire manual ? Uh , no , there wasn 't time . Ah ... Well , then , I 'll give you some pointers . Welcome , MADOX . The opening act is over . That 's him ! It 's time for the main event ! Bastard ! Come on , try and kill me ! You 're pathetic ! What 's wrong ? Done for already ? Can 't you let me enjoy this a little bit longer ? ! Sh ... Shit ! Take this ! Serves you right , you baby turtle , you ! Hurry it up ! - " Overload ! Please exit the elevator ... " - Oh no ! " ... if you are by the door . " N ... Not this again ! That 's great . If you can 't even do that much you 'll ruin the name of Tankbuster ! That trick won 't work on me ! No good ! What do we do , MADOX ? This is death by slow torture ! What floor is this ? I should be pretty high up . I hope I 've got a lead on that guy with the tank . Shiori ! Shiori ! You 've been waiting for me ! Kouji ! Gotcha ! Run , run ! You 've got nowhere to go , MADOX ! S ... Shit ! It 's the final round ! Come on , MADOX , show me what you 've got ! There you are ! You 've got guts ! Take this ! The smells , the sounds , the vibrations ! I love it ! I 'm not running away anymore ! Die , damn you ! This is the coup de grace ! Shit ! You 're strung up in a clever trap ! W ... Why you ! MADOX , I don 't mind falling if you go with me ! " MADOX ... ? " Both you and MADOX are out of your minds ! TAKE THIS ! Kouji ! Are you all right ? Are you hurt ? Yeah . I 'm really beaten up . Sorry to keep you waiting so long . But I 've got something I want to tell you after all , Shiori .

 Planet David of Lieutenant Jimenez ! Drop your weapon and surrender ! Insurrection is a treasonous act ! If you 're truly an officer , then you must honor your oath ! Lieutenant Jimenez ! Republic of Brando - Presidential Mansion His Excellency 's condition ? He 's unconscious , sir . His Excellency 's condition ? This is Dr. Carlos , the personal physician to the President . Dispatch an ambulance and the infectious disease team to the President 's mansion at once ! We 've got a patient here with signs of a Bisector rash . There 's a possibility he 's infected with Sarasota Encephalitis . Lock down the mansion at once , and seal all exits . You are all to stay inside . Lock down the mansion ? ! Hurry ! Lock down the mansion ? ! Hurry ! Hurry ! This is an emergency , sir . The President is ill , and the mansion has been sealed . It 's Sarasota Encephalitis , sir . He 'll be placed in isolation . I 'm afraid we can 't maintain surveillance . 0 ... Of course ... he doesn 't suspect a thing ... Administer a heart stimulant . 50 units of Trampoline . I 'm counting on you . You stay here . Once the infectious disease team arrives , we must all be examined . Sarasota Encephalitis is a highly communicable disease . We mustn 't leave until we are all checked . Water ... Give me water ... You cannot have water now ... I 'll bring you some Estrogen drink . Who are you ? I 'm Joe , a Crusher . These are my accomplices , Halos ... Ricky ... How do you do . Ricky ... How do you do . How do you do . ... and Elfin . Great performance , Mr. President ! So you 're the renowned Crusher Joe team . Since you specifically requested us , we couldn 't refuse . This is a most serious matter . I 'm really glad that you came . You bet it 's serious ! You risked your life to meet us ! What if you had screwed up those drugs ? This , the Republic of Brando , and the State of Carmines the fate of two nations hangs in the balance . Compared to that , my life is of little consequence . C ... Cool ! Silly ! And , your request is ? There 's been a space wreck ... It 's the Sp hard , our Space Force 's high-speed cruiser . It was hijacked by insurrectionists , and forced to land on David of the 4th planet of the Brando System . The ship is heavily damaged . Aboard the Sp hard is a Major Tanya . Your mission is to rescue her , and to destroy the " Ash , " the ultimate weapon that she is guarding . Rescue the Major and dispose of an ultimate weapon , eh ? Oh , boy . On this disk is data concerning the planet David of and the ultimate weapon Ash . For 5 years , my nation has waged bloody war with our enemy Carmines . But the war will soon be over . The Galactic Federation mediated peace talks , and Brando and Carmines have agreed to put an end to the fighting . However , a group of military officers oppose the agreement . They regard it to be a defeat , and plan to continue the war . Ash is our nation 's ultimate , most - highly-classified weapon . The reason why I 'm requesting your help , and revealing this secret is because some high-ranking military officer must have betrayed me . Unfortunately , I do not yet know who leads the war faction . I cannot trust the military . Had I naively given them this mission instead they would obtain the Ash , and that would be disastrous . The military would use the Ash indiscriminately . Just when a ray of peace was on the horizon more devastating war would cast us into darkness again . So that 's why you called us . You are a burning flame of hope . For me , you are the only hope . 40 $ . ! Huh ? Joe ! Coming up on the central hospital . After administering Trampoline , the symptoms have disappeared . This doesn 't look like Sarasota Encephalitis after all .

The principle is unclear , but it can destroy all the organisms on an entire planet ! All the living things disintegrate , and turn into something ash-like . They don 't call it " Ash " for nothing ! On top of that , the device is very small and portable . No wonder the President risked his life to hire us Crushers . If the rebels get a hold of this , you can kiss the peace good-bye ! What kind of a planet is David of ? It isn 't your average planet ... It 's a perfect match for Ash . The Brando Space Force was in control of it until recently and they had a Cloaked RD facility there . " Cloaked ? " Robot anti-personnel weapons ... Simply put , blood-thirsty machines that kill ! Some data has been erased . The Cloaked Project was abandoned . The equipment was destroyed , the data was erased and the RD base was shut down . The entire planet of David of became a restricted zone . No surprise there ! Thanks to the war , it 's all screwed up . 4-B 101 ! A spaceship on approach vector ! It 's a big one ... A warship ! They think that was funny ? ! They asked for it ! They think that was funny ? ! Attention private craft ... depart at once ! This is a restricted zone under Space Force jurisdiction . We are Crushers . Our presence was requested by President Elgar no . Thus , we 're not in violation of anything . Ask the President for all the details . Crushers ? ! I am Commander Mario of the Brando Space Force Central Command . I 've not been informed of any such request . I 'll repeat myself once . Depart immediately ! This is a classified mission ! Try to lie more convincingly ! This is a classified mission ! Try to lie more convincingly ! Try to lie more convincingly ! We aren 't lying ! Go check it out ! We 'll destroy them . Blasters ! Halos ! I know ! Fire ! Ow ! No. 2 engine destroyed ! Eat these ! Ow ! No. 2 engine destroyed ! Fire ! Weapons-control systems damaged ! Main engine is off-line ! Weapons-control systems damaged ! Main engine is off-line ! Main engine is off-line ! Helm is not responding ! Helm is not responding ! Maneuvering thrusters are down ! Helm is not responding ! Joe , this isn 't good ! Power levels decreasing fast ! We 're going down . Brace yourselves ! Shut up ! Elfin ! Hey , are you alright ? Yeah ... I 'm alive ... for the time being . I 'm alright too ! Nobody asked you ! Geez ! I need a position check , Elfin our present location , and the range and bearing to the Sp hard . Rogen Ricky ... Rogen What is it ? You go check the hangar ... Check the fighters and Garcon for damage . OK ! What about me ? You check and repair any damaged systems . Leave it to me ! Don 't let the Crushers beat us ! Captain ! Divide the choppers and tanks into two groups . I 'll command one group , and head to the Sp hard . The other group will deploy around the ship and keep watch . Keep watch ? ! For what , the Crushers ? No , the Cloaked . " Cloaked ? ! " But , sir , they 're supposed to be extinct ! That 's what the Second Investigative Team put down in its report . What became extinct was the Third Investigative Team ! The Space Force secretly dispatched a Third Investigative Team . The Government only received the Second Team 's reports . The Third Team was a classified operation . Then , the Quakers are flourishing . They survived , and their capabilities far exceed the original projections . The Space Force withheld this information ? ! For two reasons . First , as the war against Carmines had escalated we didn 't have the time to eliminate the Cloaked . And , second , the Cloaked were considered valuable . " Valuable ? ! " It would have been a pity ... to throw away such a marvelous weapon . Halos ... I 'll take point . Don 't lose track of the Shard 's rescue signal ! You didn 't need to tell me that . I 'm already on top of it ! Ricky , don 't screw up ! Shut your mouth , Bongo ! I wonder what this is ? Cloaked ! All units break ! Evasive maneuvers ! What the heck are they ? ! Beats me ! I 've never seen them before ! We 're not making any progress ! Halos , go cover Garcon ! Rogen The robots ? Weren 't they destroyed a long time ago ? ! What is it ? Halos ! I love you ! No way ! I don 't need your loin ' ! You cold-heated fool ! Emergency announcement ! What is it ? Emergency announcement ! I 've successfully captured and dissected a Cloaked . Cloaked are robots designed to kill human targets . They evolve and are self-replicating . Cloaked ? ! Weren 't they all destroyed ? The original models were destroyed by saturation EM bombing . But these are a new strain of Cloaked . These new strains , which have evolved and multiplied , have bio chips inside their CPU 's that render them immune to the effects of EM bursts . Bio Chips ? ! Yes , ma 'am . Yes , ma 'am . Yes , ma 'am . They 're more evolved than Bongo ! They are much more primitive than me ! The Cloaked exist solely to kill and harm humans . They reproduce and evolve only to further that goal . Compared to me , they 're nothing but toys ! Those things are like dust mites . And all we 're getting is the beacon ... Rats , I was expecting too much . Dirk , hurry up ! It 's ironic isn 't it ... I 'm being protected by rebels ! We can 't let you die , Major . What you 're guarding is what 's inside this case , isn 't it , Lieutenant Jimenez . You ... and what 's inside the case . Only one person can unlock that case ... that 's you , Major Tanya . Who told you that ? The leader of the faction that wants the war to continue , right ? Who is it ? ! A rescue team ? Watch her ! Punch through at once ! The Crushers will beat us to it if we don 't get our act together ! There are too many of them ! We can 't penetrate their lines ! Plasma cluster-bombs ! Wipe them out with plasma cluster-bombs ! In this battle ? ! Just do it ! This is an emergency ! In this battle ? ! Just do it ! This is an emergency ! Just do it ! This is an emergency ! But ... our men are down there ... But ... our men are down there ... Just do it ! But ... our men are down there ... Ricky , the Sp hard is infested with Cloaked . I wonder if Joe is OK . Joe ... Ricky , I 'll act as a decoy to distract the Cloaked . While I 'm doing that , you and Halos enter the ship . A decoy ? Elfin will ? Damn right ! Al ... Alright ! What about you , Tabs ' ? Do what you want . Don 't go overboard . This isn 't a Labradorean ship . So whose is it ? Major Tanya ! Major Tanya ! Who are you ? Crusher Joe . I 've come to rescue you , Major . Do you have some water for me ? No water ... But I do have some Estrogen drink . The President ordered you ... to rescue me ? And , to take care of the disposal of the Ash . You 're a Crusher , did you say ? He hired us . Your President doesn 't trust the military . Then I 'll give the orders . From now on , you are to obey my commands . I 'm the one in charge of disposing of the Ash so you 'll do what I say . Crushers are free agents . We don 't take orders from anyone . Then tell me , can you handle the disposal of the Ash ? I 'm the only one who can defuse it . I therefore order you to escort me to the disposal area . Once we are done , you are to convey me back to Brando . Is there any way to get out of here ? Yes ... but only if you do as I say . But ... Don 't you have a mission to complete ? Let 's Oh ! Oh ! 40 $ . ! 40 $ . ! Halos ! Ricky ! You made it ! Of course ! But you shouldn 't have brought along any uninvited guests ! No way ! Why you ! Major ! Hold it ! Major ! That 's our Space Force , for sure . It doesn 't mean that they 're on your side . Major , the government is leading us on the path to self-destruction . They 've surrendered to a foolish ideology , and thrown away our chance for victory ! Join with us . The government is opposing the will of the people ! If you would just cooperate with us , our nation 's victory is assured . We 'll wipe out Carmines , and become the rulers of the universe ! You are the ones who are obstructing the peace . No nation has ever prospered when the military rampages out of control ! Shut up ! Joe , can you hear me ? Joe ! Answer me ! 40 $ . ! Major Tanya . Sir . W ... W ... Why ... The penalty for insurrection is execution . Space Force regulations require a hearing first . Do you have an objection ? Under the authority granted to me by the President , I executed an insurrectionist . Major Tanya . From now on , you are under my command . I 'd like you to hand Ash over to me . Are these the orders of President Elgar no ? That 's correct . I understand . But before that , may I have a glass of water ? Bring her some water . Yes sir . Bring her some water . I 'll take it from here . The first of the three safety locks has been disengaged . What do you think you 're doing ? ! I ought to ask you the same question , sir . What do you plan to do with the Ash , Colonel ? D ... Dispose of it , of course . Those are the President 's orders . You 're lying ! What ? ! You 're " ling ! The President made no such request to you . That 's ridiculous ! Just what are you implying ? ! He ordered me to come here , to rescue you , and to dispose of the Ash . Then , say the password . Huh ? Password ? ! Then , say the password . Every direct order from the President is accompanied by a password . You 've yet to tell me the password , Colonel . Th ... That 's because because you don 't know it , do you ? I 'm a high-ranking officer . There 's no need for passwords ! The rebel leader is someone in the military who wants the war to go on . Even if you are a high officer or a general if you don 't have the password , you aren 't trusted by the President . Colonel , the rebel leader ordered you to come here and kill me and seize the Ash . So what ? ! We love the Republic of Brando ! We must honor the sacrifice of our brave comrades who died fighting Carmines . There 's no need for the war to end ! The Brando Space Force will destroy Carmines ! Give it to me , Major ! Hand the Ash over to me ! With the Ash , the course of the war will be changed ! Carmines will be destroyed , and we will be the victors ! That 's what the Ash was built for ! If we don 't use it , we 'll regret it forever . Don 't come any closer ! Now it 's time for me to ask the questions . Tell me ... Who ordered you to come here , Colonel ? I ... I came here on my own initiative . Oh ! Stop ! If you don 't tell me the identity of your commander , I 'll activate the Ash . Have you gone mad ? ! You 'll die along with us ! I 've been prepared for that since I accepted this mission . I can dispose of the Ash , and you as well , Colonel . It 's really an ideal arrangement . Reconsider , Major ... What 's in it for you ? Why sacrifice your life for the sake of those losers ? ! Because it is my duty . Major , I 'll ask you again ... Back off ! Who 's your boss ? I came here on my own authority ! Now all it takes is a push of the activation button . The admiral ! Admiral Caraway ! Admiral Caraway ? ! The Grand Admiral of the Space Force ? ! Crusher ... Joe ! What are you doing ? ! Jimenez ! The switch ... Stop it ! Stop that thing ! No ... it 's impossible . We 're all going to die . When will it activate ? ! In 20 minutes . Ha ! Looks like this is gonna be some race ! Move it ! After them ! Go after them ! Put me down ! That 's an order ! Go on without me ! My , you 've got a mouth on you ! Don 't you want to live ? ! Halos ! I 'll stay here ... Sorry ' bout that . Abandoning you would violate the terms of our contract . Looks like you 've made it . We want Garcon and Fighter-1 back on board . Rogen Elfin , return to the Minerva right away . The Ash was activated ! What ? ! We 've got 15 minutes ! If we don 't get outta here at once , we 'll all go up in smoke ! Wait for me ! Colonel ! C ... Colonel ! Colonel ! Colonel ! Colonel ! You , of all people you are not gonna get out alive ! Bongo ! Get the auxiliary seat out ! W ... We 're alive ... aren 't we ? ! Either that , or this is Hell . Ha ! You 're still alive ! Why did you do that , you rat ? ! Ha ! You 're still alive ! No , this doesn 't look like Hell to me ...

 Now , the beta synchrotron sends the electrons through this magnet , which bends the course of them down to the reaction vessel . Stay away from that elbow joint . All right . Bran , you wanna get that ? Now , this is a tunable excimer laser . It 's tuned to the exact resonance of the plutonium-239 that 's in that reaction vessel , down that end . Now , if we 're all set , and hit it . Now , watch your eyes . Roper ! This is where electrons bombard the stuff . Lasers ionize it and send it off to the condenser . Now it 's a conductive element . Now to the condenser . Here it gets converted into its liquid metallic state . Would you repeat that , please ? This is where it 's converted into its liquid metallic state . This all happened about 50 seconds ago . It 's the purest plutonium in the universe . Pretty , isn 't it ? - 99 % ? - No . 99.997 . Bob , what do you think ? A weapon this big with 20 times the punch of anything anybody 's got ? - Is he kidding ? - No , he did it , all right . It 's a brilliant achievement . - He 'd get the Nobel if he could publish . - Publish ? I said " if . " All right . I want a prototype facility fully operational , before Geneva if possible . Everything goes through Energy in Washington , need-to-know , SCI clearance . Set him up . Whatever he needs . Someplace quiet . Away from prying eyes . And keep an eye on him . Here we go . Hi , Mom . Paul , it 's 4 : 30 in the morning . What 's the book ? I don 't know . Some cheap novel . Come on . I 'll buy you a drink . Be careful , it 's hot . What ? What 's the matter ? You 're growing so fast . Yeah , but that 's no reason to have a nervous breakdown . Come here . We got to get you a Valium or some heroin or something . Hurry up . He 's coming . - What is that ? - Nitrogen triiodide . - What does it do ? - Unstable with respect to shock . - Well , what does that mean ? - Once it dries , if you touch it , it explodes . - You 're crazy ! - You say that like it 's a bad thing . - Whose drawer ? - Roland 's . - Poor Roland . - No , he 'll love it . Builds character . He 's coming ! Hiya , Roland , could I borrow your English notes ? You 've got to be kidding me . But I lent you my math homework at least 10 times . Sorry , Stephens , it 's a dog-eat-dog world out there . I gotta look out for number one . Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . Last time , we learned that plutonium is perfectly suited for the release of enormous amounts of energy due to its ability to fission under the action of slow neutrons . Now , here we have the isotope plutonium-239 . And here , we have two very interesting inventions based on this . Now , can anyone tell us the principle behind the implosion device ? Paul , can you enlighten us ? Yes , Roland . Yes . Your implosion design simply uses a chemical high explosive to squeeze a subcritical piece of weapons-grade plutonium-239 until it 's supercritical , thereby producing an atomic explosion . - Thank you , Roland . - Thank you , Mr. Wilke . He did it . Him ! Paul Stephens is sick . - Bye-bye . - Bye-bye . Hi , Jen . - Hi , Paul . - Did you lose something ? It 's so dumb . I locked my car keys in the glove compartment because I always lose them . So , now I 've lost the keys to the glove compartment . Dumb , right ? You got a nail file in there ? - Yeah , why ? - Let me see it . - What are you gonna do ? - Don 't worry about it . - It 's a new car . - Trust me . That was terrible , you know ? - What ? - Roland . Terrible ? I thought it was very effective . Not bad . Thank you . - Where did you learn that ? - CIA child recruitment program . Listen , what you are doing Sunday night ? Nothing , why ? - You wanna study ? - You mean together ? What about Mr. Perfect ? Who , Eric ? Don 't worry about Eric . He 's just pretty . - What do you say ? - Sure . My house . 115 North Highland near Thurston . You gonna write it down ? 8 : 00 , all right ? I 'll have to babysit my little brother . Babysitting . Does he bite ? No . I 'm the one that bites . Yo ! Hey , Stephens , how about it ? - Excuse me , Doctor ? - Yeah ? Hi , I 'm Elizabeth Stephens . Hi . - Please have a seat . - Thanks . Could you spell this for me , Doctor ? I can 't seem to read your writing . M-A-T-H-E-W-S-O-N . John Mathewson . And you 're interested in a one-bedroom sublet , furnished . - Yeah . - Any special requirements ? It should be quiet and in an English-speaking country . I think we can handle that . - Children ? - No . - No children . - Pets ? No pets , no children , no flamenco dancing . - So it 's just you and ... - Just me and my books . And my memories , of course . We have a very nice garden condominium . On sublet . New building . Good neighborhood . $ 500 a month , including utilities . - The particulars are inside . - No , no . That 's okay . - You don 't like it ? - I love it . I 'll take it . - You 'll take it ? - Yeah . Just like that . - Without looking at it ? - Well , you said it was nice , didn 't you ? Well ... Okay . That was easy . I 'm very easy . Well , so that 's that . If there 's anything else I can do ... - As a matter of fact , there is one thing . - Yes ? Can I ask you a question ? - Okay . - The thing is , I 've been here for six weeks down at the Carriage House Motel , and I don 't know a soul in town , and you 've been so nice . I thought ... Perhaps some night you 'll let me buy you dinner ? - Is that crazy ? - I can 't . No . - No ? Really ? - It 's sweet of you , but it 's quite impossible . No , no . Hey ! I understand . You have something . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll go back to my room and watch them rewrap the soap . - It 's not that bad , is it ? - It 's not wonderful . Paul , come say hi . Dr. Mathewson , this is my son , Paul . Your son ? I didn 't realize you ... - This is terrible . I feel like a perfect ass . - Nobody 's perfect . I 'm sorry . That was not called for . As a matter of fact , my husband and I are separated . I mean ... Hi , Paul . I 'm John . You a science buff ? Lasers . Fantastic things , lasers . You ever seen one in the flesh ? - No . - Would you like to ? Sure . Well , the funny coincidence is I have access to the sexiest lasers in the entire free world . If your mom says it 's okay , you can come down to the lab and I will give you the grand tour . Laser heaven . In return , I get to take you and your mom to dinner . Sunday . Deal ? State your name and business . Hi . My name is Paul Stephens , and I 'm here to see Dr. Mathewson . Go through the gate and up to the main building . Would you put these on and see that gentleman over there , please ? Thank you . The laser will fire in 12 minutes . Please clear the active areas . - What are those things ? - Motion detectors . Really ? What do they do ? Anything that moves , they detect it . Three yellow suits to the loading dock , please . Jack , pick up on five . Harry , seven-two , seven-two . Dr. Mathewson . So , what do you think ? - Not bad . - Not bad ? I just cut through a steel plate with a beam of light ! He says it 's not bad . A copper vapor laser , the most powerful that I 've worked with . Here 's the main reaction chamber . Reaction column . Vacuum assembly . Everything back there in the cage is the assay area . Everything 's run by the robot . What did your old man do for a living ? He taught architecture at Cornell . - What 's that ? - What ? - That stuff . - Lubricating oil for the robot . No , no , no . That green stuff in those bottles . That . That 's americium-241 . It 's one of the things we make here . Come on . I 'll show you the grounds . Down by the lake . It 's beautiful down there . - Where 's your father now ? - Saudi Arabia . Really ? What happened ? I guess he didn 't like being married anymore . Some guys don 't know when they are well off . He 's a brilliant architect , but he 's just kind of a shit in his personal life . So are you going to go out with Elizabeth ? - Elizabeth ? - My mother . Right , Elizabeth . I don 't know . That 's pretty much up to her , I guess . She 's quite an unusual woman , your mother , don 't you think ? - Paul ? - Excuse me ? - Your mother ? - Yeah , right . Very unusual . - Everything okay ? - Yeah . No more . My head is spinning . It 's good for the head to spin . Keeps it stable . Paul , you haven 't even touched yours . No , thank you . I don 't drink wine . - Why is that ? - It impairs my judgment . What 's the matter ? - Air conditioning . - Here , take my jacket . I left my sweater in Dr. Mathewson 's car . Would you be a sweetheart ? So when he was six years old , he started getting up at 2 : 00 every morning and staying up . Here you go , Mom . - Is that better ? - Yes . Thanks , sweetheart . Thank you for dinner . It was very stimulating . What ? Are you leaving ? No dessert ? Sorry , I have a date . Wait , wait . I didn 't give you your present . - Present ? - Yeah . It 's a brain-teaser . You must get each of the balls in the corners . A colleague of mine at MIT invented it . He 's a games theorist . He wants to market it . He says anyone who can do it inside of two minutes ... I guess I 'm going to have to come up with something harder . Plus which , there are only two uses in the world for plutonium . In weapons and in reactors , right ? So , if they make reactors , why say it 's medical ? And if it 's medical , why are they fooling around with plutonium ? It doesn 't make any sense . How do you know it 's plutonium ? Maybe it 's something else . It 's not . It 's little flakes of plutonium in a green gel . It 's called a scintillant . Why invite you inside ? It 's crazy . So , he 's crazy . Look what he does for a living . He 's hot for my mother . He figures I 'm a dumb kid . - He 's hot for your mother ? Really ? - Got a knife or screwdriver ? - Last drawer . - Plus which , he 's got all these security clearances . I don 't know what they are . Los Alamos , Livermore Labs , Oak Ridge . - Do you know what they make at Oak Ridge ? - What ? Nuclear warheads . - So , what are you saying ? - I 'm saying he lied , okay ? At the very least , he invites me out there , and then he lies like I 'm some kind of a wimp . - I think you are overreacting . - To what ? I don 't know . Oedipal jealousy maybe . Oedipal jealousy ? What 's that ? Psychology class ? Does this look like Oedipal jealousy ? - What is that ? - What does it look like ? - A five-leaf clover . Where did you find it ? - Growing outside that lab . You know the odds on that kind of mutation happening naturally , without chemicals or radiation or something ? - What ? - There are none . I looked it up . It 's like a billion-to-one . It never happens . Maybe you 're just very lucky . Oh , my God . Who knows about this ? - Just us . - We should do something . What ? I don 't know . Tell somebody . The newspaper , my father ! I mean , you can 't just waltz into town and set up a bomb factory next to people 's houses . It 's not a factory . It 's more like a laboratory . What 's the difference ? It 's nuclear , right ? You have to have hearings . You have to let the community know about it . There are laws . It 's a government lab . They 're not going to let anybody in there to look around . - They let you in . - Fluke . The guy was horny , so he took a chance . - So we do nothing ? Is that it ? - What do you suggest we do ? - March down Washington ? - My parents met at a march on Washington . Really ? Very ' 60s . Were you born at a Stones concert ? This isn 't funny . Do you know what this is like ? It 's like when you read about Anne Frank or something and you say to yourself , " Jesus . Why didn 't they do something ? " The whole world was collapsing . They just sat around , life as usual . " ' Maybe it 'll go away " ' But it never goes away . It only gets worse . And nobody thinks about the future . What 's the matter ? - Who is Anne Frank ? - A girl in my English class , all right ? What are you looking at ? - The storm . There 's a storm coming . - So ? The lab . They 've got a security system there . TV cameras , motion detectors , all kinds of stuff , only the thing is , it 's all electric . So ? - Lightning . Lightning . Don 't you get it ? - No . We can get in there . Gort ? But he 's a robot . Without you , what could he do ? There 's no limit to what he could do . He could destroy the Earth . If anything should happen to me , you must go to Gort . You must say these words ... Please repeat this . That 's very bad for you . Lots of stuff is bad for you . Would you come here for a minute ? - Hello ! We 're home . - Jen ? Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . Hi . It 's gonna come down . Hello , sweetheart . Hi . This is Paul Stephens from my science class . - Hello , Paul . - Very pleased to meet you both . Barnaby asleep ? Hey , hey , hey , hey . Chocolate-chocolate chip . What do you say ? I was just gonna drive Paul home , actually . - Okay , okay . Rain check then . - Sorry . Drive carefully . They 're predicting some flooding . - Bye ! - Bye-bye . There it is . German car , right ? Figures . - Incredible . - What ? Dr. Strangelove . He 's in there hitting on my mother and watching my tapes . - Paul ? - What ? What if there 's more than one guard ? No , the whole place is set up so it can be watched by one person . Look , trust me , it 's brilliant . Besides , what can they do to us , anyway ? We 're kids . It 's a prank , right ? Hello ? Anybody home ? State your name and business , please . - Where are you ? - You 're on a remote intercom , ma 'am . What seems to be the problem ? This isn 't Baker North , is if ? No , this is Medatomics Company . Where 's Baker North ? I 've been driving around for an hour . Campus is on the other side of town , ma 'am . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . I 'm supposed to meet my sister . And I think there 's something wrong with the car . And ... I 'm a little scared . Okay , come on through . Tell me when . Okay , get ready . Now ! Thank you so much . Your left front tire 's flatter than a pancake . - No . Really ? - Take it easy . We 'll get you fixed up . Some night , huh ? You got a spare ? A spare what ? A spare tire . Yes , Information , you got a number for emergency road service ? Yeah , I 'll hold . Excuse me , call you back . Hello , Central Office ? Charlie ! Ben Bozman over at Medatomics . Is it raining down there ? Well , it is here . Electric storm . It 's fritzing up the whole system . What ? No . Radiation checkpoints , okay . Look , what can I tell you ? There 's thunder and lightning . I keep getting these brownouts . What ? Of course I did ! But they 're all just flipping over . You know these damn things . Every time you get a power surge , they go crazy . What ? A and B corridor just both went at once , if you can believe that . I 'm gonna do an onsite check and wait till the storm passes to reset . Okay ? Hate to go in there , Charlie . They got stuff in there that zaps your gonads right off . - Hi . - Hi . What seems to be the trouble ? This jack isn 't going to work . This jack is Mickey Mouse . - Hey , Ben . - Hi , Terry . Looks like rain . What do you think ? - What 's the matter ? - Damn storm fritzed up the whole system . - Did you call it in ? - Did I call it in ? Tell you the truth , I 'd rather have one good dog than all that fancy equipment . Why don 't you give me a hand ? - Where 's the lug nuts ? - The what ? The things that hold the wheel on . What do they look like ? Well ? Oh , my God ! You were brilliant . All that crying with the guard . Thanks . Can we get out of here now ? Genius . That was some sweetie , huh ? Come on , now . You 're a married man . Hey , a man can still have a little snack between meals , can 't he ? Good-bye , sweetheart . All right . First thing tomorrow , we take it to Dr. Nicci . - Who ? - Bob Nicci , a friend of my father 's in the Chemistry Department at Cornell . - He 'll verify what it is . - I told you what it is . Yeah , but I need a second source for my article . Like Woodward and Bernstein . Who 's that ? - Article , huh ? - Yeah , why ? I have another thought . Paul , that 's very sick . I thought you wanted proof . That 's proof . - But we have the stuff . Isn 't that enough ? - Enough for what ? An article , an exposé in Rolling Stone . - I bet they 'd publish it ... - Rolling Stone , come on ! Who 's gonna care about a couple of kids who stole some stuff from a lab somewhere ? You want a story ? Write one about a kid who builds an atomic bomb ! - You realize what you 're saying ? - Yes . - You are weird . - I 'm weird ? I didn 't make that stuff . - No . It 's too dangerous . Isn 't it ? - No . It 's just a piece of equipment , like a toaster or a clock . A bunch of parts that have to be put together . So you just never put them together . Look , people used to be afraid of cars because they didn 't understand them . Cars don 't kill people . Cars have killed more people than all the atomic bombs that were ever made . - That 's not a logical argument . - I 'm not talking about logic . I 'm talking about the first privately built nuclear device in the history of the world . Well . Thank you for a very interesting evening . - Science fair , really ? - 45th Annual Science something . You get to go to New York . That 's the same one that Roland 's entering ? " Retinal deprivation and auditory enhancement in the common Cricetus . " Zoology ! I 'm gonna raise a generation of hamsters in the dark and see if it improves their hearing . That 's kind of a weird experiment . No . The field 's wide open . I think I got a chance to win . Well , then go for it . Great to see someone turn over a new leaf . - Hi . - Hi , Paul . C-4 . High explosives . Very stable . It 's fantastic stuff . Don 't be around when it goes off , okay ? Say , Paulie , what 're you gonna do with this stuff ? No , don 't tell me . $ 60 . So , you been down to the garage much ? A little . How 's the army ? It 's a living . Take care , genius . Don 't blow yourself up . Dr. Wilson , got a minute ? This is Lot 13 . It 's completely flat . - Did you recheck it ? - Yeah , three times . Run a full-spec analysis . And keep this between us , okay ? Sure . Water , citric acid , sodium laureth sulfate , hydrolyzed animal protein , glycerin , U.S. FDA coloring number five . What the hell is it ? - It 's shampoo . - Shampoo ? Yeah , we think either one of the generic local brands or maybe something called " Alberto 's VO5 . " - " Plus glitter . " - Glitter ? Yeah . Shredded aluminum foil like they use on a greeting card . Thank you , Howard . Somebody has a pretty weird sense of humor . John , the time-key record has you in the building four weeks ago , Sunday night at 11 : 08 p.m. , - out at 11 : 49 . - No . This is a mistake . - You weren 't here ? - No . - Somebody was with your card . - That 's impossible ! Look , Miles , it 's a computer . They 're not infallible . Wait a minute . Wasn 't that the night of that big electrical storm ? I don 't know . So what ? - Oh , my God . - What ? Well , here 's your answer . There was a power dropout and you had some garbage in the system . - It says right here , " Mathewson , 11 : 08 p.m. " - Yeah , I know . I know , but do me a favor . Just check it out . Will you ? I mean , you know these guys . It 's like cabin fever . It happens all the time . I 'm sure it 'll turn up again . - " Cabin fever " ? - Yeah , I mean , when I was at Livermore , there were two guys who kept mice ... It 's a significant amount . I have to report it . Come on . They 'll be all over us ! Look , I 'm on a crash program here . You wanna bring everything to a dead stop - just because you got a little glitch ? - I 'm sorry , John . I don 't make the rules ! Hello ? - Hi . - Hi ! Listen , can I talk to Paul ? - Paul 's away until tomorrow night . - Where ? New York . He has a project in the science fair . He didn 't tell you ? No . What kind of project ? Something at school . Guinea pigs . No , hamsters . Why ? What 's up ? It 's nothing . I just had some tickets to the ballgame . Oh , gosh ! What ? They need me on the floor . Listen . What hotel is he at ? The New York Penta . Penta , great . I 'll give him a ring , okay ? Okay . Great , well . Listen , I 'd better go , bye-bye . Bye . You 're saying you never actually went inside and saw what he was doing ? - No . - Why not ? He never asked me . What 's the problem ? Was he sexually abusing the hamsters or something ? You 're in section 96 . That 's in the balcony . The judges are circulating now , and the final eliminations start at 3 : 00 . - Do you have accommodations ? - I 'm a guest in the hotel . - What is that ? - Key to the room . Very scientific . Hey , Roland , what do you say ? Stephens , keep away . Just keep away from me . - Good luck , Roland . - Yeah , sure . Keep in touch . Effectively , what my project deals with is Halley 's Comet , and tracking Halley 's Comet for the duration it 'll be here . Halley 's Comet will be most visible in the southern hemisphere . What are you doing after the fair ? - Tonight ? - Yeah , tonight . Electrodes discharge which makes impact with the atom . - What number are we ? - Ninety-six . There we are . Wow , look at her . Okay , so , we set it up and right before the elimination , we go downstairs to the car , we bring it up here , we unveil it , we win first prize , we get to go on television . - Am I leaving anything out ? - Just the part where we get shot for treason . I 'd like to try Italian . You want Italian ? Yeah , yeah . It 's great . - Maybe we could go tonight ? - Okay , sure . It 's downtown . - Hi . - Hi . Where 's your badge ? You gotta have a badge . Jenny . - Jeffrey . Hi . - Hi . What is that ? Nothing special . Just some microwaves . I invented a way of using insects as a dietary supplement for humans . Beetles , ants , mosquitoes . You grind them up . - Low cholesterol and ... - Shut up , Eccles . That 's disgusting . My project is quite fascinating . I took six common toads and froze them in liquid nitrogen for six months . - Why ? - Wouldn 't you like to know ! My project is a study of social behavior in elevators . How people react under pressure . Her eyes moved away ! Don 't you like me ? She doesn 't like me ! You 'll have to excuse him . He 's got a hormone imbalance . - What 's your project ? - Nothing . Just some hamsters . - He 's lying . He blinked . - They 're all afraid of the competition . What 's the difference ? It 's not if you win , it 's how you play the game , right ? No . It 's if you win . Dr. Mathewson , Lieutenant Colonel Conroy , Defense Nuclear Agency . - Hi , how are you ? - I 've been better . So , somebody took your magic beans and built himself a firecracker . - Is that it ? - That 's it . How big a bang are we talking about ? Fifty kilotons , give or take . Doctor , unless I 'm mistaken , 50 kilotons could just about evaporate a small city . - That 's right . - Good Christ ! And the kid put this thing together ? Yeah , kind of makes you think , doesn 't it ? Any idea who he 's working with ? I don 't think he 's working with anybody . I think he did it by himself . - What for ? - I don 't know . - Maybe to see if he could do it . - Crazy ! It 's a crazy world . Okay , how 's this ? " Paul Stephens , a high school student from Ithaca , New York , " unveiled a homemade atomic bomb at the 45th Annual Science Fair today , " thereby becoming the first private citizen to join the nuclear club , " an exclusive group whose other members include the United States , " the Soviet Union , Great Britain , France and China . " If I 'm in the nuclear club , do I get a jacket ? You get anything you want . - Jenny . - What ? I never thought I 'd say this to anybody , but I 've gotta go get the atomic bomb out of the car . Oh , yeah ? Hi , Dr. Mathewson . - Is this him ? - Paul , what do you think you 're doing ? Well , I thought we might start with some kissing - and then move into the fancy stuff . - Cute , real cute . Normal background radiation . I don 't think it 's here . Wow , what is that ? - Neutron detector . - Really ? Who makes those ? - Don 't try my patience , boy ! - Come on , Paul . Get the stuff near the typewriter . What 's that over there ? - Excuse me , this is a private room . - Who are you ? My name is Jennifer Anderman . My father 's a lawyer . Good . You 're gonna need him . You can 't come in here without a warrant . - It 's unconstitutional . - Yeah , what is this , Russia ? You have exactly 10 seconds to come up with that damn thing . I demand to make a phone call . They can 't do this , Paul . It 's illegal search and seizure . Would you please escort this young lady outside ? Don 't you touch me ! I want to know the charges ! - Yeah ! - The charges ? Okay . How about theft of government property , transportation of stolen goods , reckless endangerment , violation of the Nuclear Regulatory Act and conspiracy to commit espionage . Is that good enough for starters ? You 're in a pack of trouble , son ! You 're not as smart as you think ! Look , Colonel , we 're not going to accomplish anything like this . When I want your expert advice , Doctor , I 'll ask for it . - We demand to see a lawyer . - You 'll see a lawyer when I say so ! Listen , I gave you an order . This isn 't a goddamn debate ! - If you 'll just please ... - Get your hands off me ! No ! - Get your hands off me ! - Okay , okay . I 'm making a phone call ! Hey , don 't you touch me ! Everybody , quiet ! Let 's all just get a little grip . Now , we did kind of burst in here . Look , Colonel , what do you say me and Paul , we take a little walk ? Just the two of us . I 'm sure we can work this whole thing out . What do you say , Paul ? Colonel ? - You have five minutes . - Thanks . - Kind of upset in there , huh ? - I don 't know why . - It 's just some lubricating oil for the robot . - What do you want us to do , put up a neon sign saying , " Secret Weapons Laboratory " ? I wish the world were a simpler place , Paul , but it 's not . Don 't worry about it . They can 't do anything to me . - Why not ? - I 'm underage . That 's really brilliant . What do you think this is , the school play ? They don 't care how old you are , or how cute . They 're gorillas . They can hurt you . Don 't you get it ? If you try to tough it out with them , they 'll lock you in a room somewhere and throw away the room ! It 's really that important to you , huh ? It 's not just me , Paul . To everybody . Now , what do you say ? Okay . - That 's better . Where is it ? - No , no . Not now . What do you mean , " Not now " ? When ? - After the fair . - Come on , Paul . But it 's gotta be judged . I 'm gonna win first prize . You 're joking . No . Did you see the junk they got down there ? Paul , forget the science fair . It 's over , okay ? No more science fair . Look , this is top-secret stuff . Nobody sees this . Not ever . You could start a war . Stop screwing around before it 's too late . Paul , for God 's sake . It was here . I swear . Jenny must have taken it . The girl hasn 't been out of our sight . Then somebody must have stolen it . Jesus . All right , son . Would you come with us now , please ? - Just a minute . - We 'll take it from here . He 's telling the truth ! Okay , fine . He has nothing to worry about . It was in a box , a toolbox ! My dad gave it to me right before he left . We really have to know where it is . I 've already told you , I don 't know . Look , guys . I 've got to go now . Come on , guys . What is that ? Just to relax you and help you remember . But I already told you . I put it in the trunk . I swear . But it wasn 't in the trunk , was it ? Just relax . Okay ! Okay ! Okay ! - You want the truth . - That would be nice . The truth is you guys are a bunch of assholes . When I get out ... You 're very hostile , Paul . Just hold him , I can do it through his shirt . What the hell ? Hey , you . Is that thing really a nuclear device ? Far out . Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention , please ? Your attention , please , ladies and gentleman . It gives me great pleasure ... Night vision . Army surplus . - The lights are on . - What ? - You took it ? How ? - Simple . Hotel computer . Got your girlfriend 's name , Jenny Anderman . Accessed the Department of Motor Vehicles for the make and license on the car . Paul , what 's wrong ? - They gave him an injection . - Probably sodium amytal . Do you have a bitter taste in your mouth ? Just keep him moving . He 'll be okay . - Have you got enough money ? - What for ? To get away . This place is crawling with Feds . I have a credit card . No , cash . Come on , money , money ! - You owe me $ 80 . - What 's wrong ? You guys are beautiful guys . - Send me a letter . - Why are you doing this ? Because life is more than freezing toads . I got a taxi ! The coast is clear , come on . Come on . Hi , folks , where to today ? Ithaca . Funny kid . - Ithaca ? - Plan . I bet you can 't guess what 's in this box . - A human head ? - Wrong . An atomic bomb . Do you want to see ? Not really . Driver , if you only had $ 87 and you had to get to Ithaca , what would you do ? Come on . Come on . Safe . You saved us . Great . Jenny . I love you , Jenny . I want to be your wife . Excuse me , can I help you ? - Mrs. Elizabeth Stephens ? - Yes . Lieutenant Colonel Conroy , U.S. Army Delta Force . These men are with the Nuclear Emergency Search Team , a duly authorized government agency . I 'm taking over these premises as a temporary crisis center . Nuclear Emergency , what ? What 's happening ? - It 's Paul . Something happened . - Paul ? He 's all right , I think . " Paul Jacob Stephens . Born Ithaca , New York , February 14th , 1970 .

That makes it all so simple . He did do some things that are against the law . - Maybe there 's a higher law . - What ? A higher law . What 're you saying ? He did it for ethics ? For reasons of conscience ? Who do you think he is , Galileo ? He 's a kid . Kids don 't have reasons . They just do things . - What do you know about children ? - I used to be one . - You don 't know him . - But I do . He 's got a gift and he wants to use it , that 's all . It 's as natural as breathing . Don 't make him into some kind of an activist . What ? Who are these people ? They are in my house . What gives them the right ? They know about everything . They know about his teeth ! Look . It 's 6.00 a.m. You 're exhausted . Why don 't you do something , for God 's sake ? - What do you suggest ? - I don 't know . Blow them up . That 's your field , isn 't it ? He 's a very resourceful kid . He 's going to be okay . I hope so . Because if anything happens to him , anything ... If one hair on his head is harmed , I promise you , I 'm going to find all of you people and I 'm going to make your lives absolutely miserable . Hello . Who ? Yes , I 'll accept . Hello , Paul . Hi , Mom , don 't get crazy . Paul , what 's going on ? They 're saying all kinds of things . Paul , did you build an atomic bomb ? - Only a little one . - Oh , my God ! Look , I 'm okay .

What it is , where it is , what happens inside , everything . - What for ? - I just want it . I can 't do that . I 've signed a security clearance . I 'll go to jail . You 'll go to jail . Look , that 's the deal . The gadget for the statement . Now , come on , I don 't have much time . Okay , what do I do , type something up ? - That 'll do for starters . - Starters ? Just meet me at the lab in one hour . Main gate . - Why the lab ? - Because that 's what I want . And make sure that we can get inside . I want photographs , too . - Photographs ? Come on , Paul ! - Yeah , lots of photographs . Tell your pals , no funny stuff . I 'm very tense . There 's no telling what I might do . - Paul . - Take it easy . You 're fine . No , I 'm a terrorist . Haven 't you been watching television ? Paul , what are you talking about ? - Paul . - Paul . Look , he trusts me . Let me do it . I 'll get it back . That 's what we want . How do we know this thing won 't be armed ? That 's right . He used the phrase , " I 'm a terrorist . " Here . " No , I 'm a terrorist . Haven 't you been watching television ?

You got the statement ? Could you open it and hand it to me , please ? What 's DOE ? Department of Energy . - They 're the guys who ... - Yeah . Okay . Let 's go . - You really want to go inside the building ? - Yeah . Paul , it 's dangerous . That 's what makes it so exciting . Of course . So , Paul . Why the big push for publicity ? Well , I was thinking , this is such a neat place . People ought to know about it . - What ? - No , really . They got lots of cool equipment , robots , plutonium . Why keep it a secret ? They should have tours , like Disneyland . Paul , you may be having fun right now ... I 'm not having any fun ! I 'm scared out of my mind . But I don 't have any choice . - Of course you do . Just give me the box . - Yeah . Great . Why not ? Are you kidding ? You think they 're going to let me go home , knowing what I know about this place ? Jesus . You 're more naive than I thought . So , what do you think they are going to do ? I think they 're going to try and kill me . Why ? That 's what I 'd do if I was them . - That 's purely hypothetical . - No , it 's perfectly logical . I 'm the leak , so plug the leak . - What are you going to do ? - Don 't worry . I 'm working on it . - Hello . - Max , thank God . - Jenny . - Yeah . Jesus ! What is going on ? You guys have been on the news . And someone said there 's a helicopter at Paul 's house ! Listen , Max , you got to do two things for us , okay ? It 's a matter of life and death . - Yeah , sure . Whose ? - Everybody 's . First , call my parents , and then call two people . I don 't care who . Have them call two people . And call the newspaper and the TV station . Are you listening ? Yeah , go ahead . Okay , there 's a place called Medatomics on Route 81 . This is Position 2 . They 're approaching the detector . Okay , Position 2 . We copy . He 's got it all right . There 's the core , explosive package , electronics , tamper , batteries . Nice design , actually . - Is it armed ? - No . You 're certain ? It 's all in sections . Paul . We know it 's not armed , Paul . So , why don 't you just put it down and walk away ? Walk away ? That 's right . I am going to count to three . - Hey , let me talk to him . - Doctor , stay out of this . Let me talk to Conroy on that thing . - This wasn 't part of the deal . - One , two ... - Don 't hit the box ! - Jesus . - He 's got plutonium in that , for God 's sake . - Shit ! Paul ! Keep your hands on the wall , Doctor . You breathe funny and I 'll blow your fucking brains out . Oh , Jesus . What ? He 's really putting it together . Give me a status report . Two , three and four , what you got ? There 's no way I can get him without hitting the green stuff or going through the Plexi . Me neither . Same here . Oh , boy . Okay , here 's the deal . We have an irrational child down there with an armed device . He seems to trust you , so you get down there . And do what ? - Disarm him and get him to take it apart . - And if he won 't ? Then just separate him from it . We 'll do the rest . - I can 't do that . - Why not ? Because I 'm not a ... Killer ? Is that the word you 're groping for , Doctor ? What the bloody hell do you think you 've been working on all these years ? What do you think all this is for ? Your own personal amusement ? To stimulate you intellectually ? You are what you are , Doctor , a son of a bitch , like the rest of us . Now for God 's sake , take some responsibility and do what has to be done . Hello , again . Do you mind if I sit down ? Two minutes . That 's cutting it close , isn 't it ? What is that ? A car key ? - The reflector ? - Salad bowls . Salad bowls ? Why not ? What did you use for the firing circuits ? Photo strobes . Photo strobes . It 's very pretty . Thanks . What do you say we take it apart before everybody goes crazy ? No , I 'm sorry . I can 't do that right now . This isn 't accomplishing anything . - Sure it is . - What ? - Deterrence . - Deterrence ? You know , when each side thinks the other will blow everybody up . It 's called , " Mutually assured destruction . " Yeah , I know what it 's called . It 's working , isn 't it ? How do you mean ? I 'm still alive , aren 't I ? Don 't talk like that . The thing is , I 've been thinking about it . I don 't think I 'm crazy enough to actually turn the key . No . That 's the problem with deterrence , isn 't it ? So I guess I blew it . What do you mean ? I 'm not getting out of here . Let me see it . Paul , give it to me . Come on . Give it to me . Hold it , gentlemen . Fellow sons of bitches . We are what we are . Right ? Here 's my responsible act . I 'm taking him out of here . Since you all like scenarios so much , I 've got one for you . It 's a game of chance . I bet you that I can turn this key and blow us all to hell , even after you shoot me ! And you 'll have to shoot me , okay ? Everybody 's problems solved in one millionth of a second . Now ... Who wants to play ? Red team , I do not want them off the premises with that gadget . Do you copy ? Please , not in the building . One stray bullet and we 've got a containment breach . - And that can mean ... - All right ! All right , listen . Yeah , copy , Command . No problem . Give me a clear shot and I 'll turn him off like a switch . You know , at least now I can publish . - What do you mean ? - I think I just blew my security clearance . - I 'm sorry . - It 's no problem . Time for a change of vocations anyway . There must be a place in the private sector for an unemployed nuclear weapons designer , don 't you think ? What ? What ? You turned it ? No , no . It happened by itself , spontaneously . Jesus . It 's counting down . It 's going to blow . Probably neutron flux . Radiation from the core can screw up this kind of solid-state timing circuit . I never heard of that . Yeah . Well , live and learn . Gentlemen , we 've got a little wrinkle here . Listen carefully , and do exactly as I say . Well , at least we have 999 hours to dismantle it . I don 't think so . Time-based circuits tend to deteriorate exponentially , faster and faster . Jesus , why did we bring it back here , then ? Why not ? Where do you want to take it ? - How about Treman Quarry ? - What ? Sure . It 's a couple of square miles at least , no one around . It 's perfect . A couple of square miles . Paul , if this thing goes , you 're going to get a really good view of a 50 to 70 kiloton explosion ! What ? You don 't know what you took , Paul . This is special stuff . It 's very nasty . It 's so hot , we don 't even know how to test it . It 's a miracle you didn 't kill yourself just carrying it home . So , if I unscrew this , I can get the core out , right ? Yeah , yeah . Got a screwdriver ? No , no , a bigger one . - What ? - It 's jammed . Let me try . It 's funny , the same thing happened at the Trinity test , 40 years ago . Really ? The core got stuck halfway in while they were trying to insert it . I wouldn 't bump it around like that , if I were you . It might decide to fire just for spite . So , what do we do ? - We could drill it . - No , no . We might get a static charge . - Disconnect the batteries . - No . - What about sparks ? - Cut the main lead . Yeah . That 's worth a try . - I 'll need to remove the middle plate . - Do it . Do it . Anybody have a Phillips head screwdriver ? How much time do we have ? I don 't know . It 's an exponential decay . Can 't you just answer the goddamn question ? I was never good at math . All right , as Y approaches infinity , - T is equal to one plus one over N to the ... - To the nth . Right . You 're a bright kid . You should do something with it . Okay . I make it about ... Three minutes to zero . Oh , boy . Excuse me , sir , what about evacuation ? Evacuation ? Of who ? The people . You mean New York ? Pennsylvania ? Vermont ? Canada ? Those people ? - I 'm at the main connector . - Okay , go ahead . - Wire clippers . - Yeah , right here . What the hell is that ? Firing circuit . I programmed the photo strobes to charge automatically 90 seconds from detonation . The timer must be all messed up . Maybe I should have made it 10 seconds . Anyhow , look , it doesn 't matter . All I have to do is cut the power . It 's this wire , right over here . All right , here I go . Ready ? One , two ... No , no , no ! Don 't cut it ! Don 't do anything ! Don 't do anything ? What are you , nuts ? Regular photographic strobe units ? That 's what you used ? - Exactly . - All right , here 's the problem . Once those things are charged , even if you turn them off , they can discharge while you 're unplugging them . - What are you talking about ? - This thing could detonate just from our trying to disconnect it . Okay . Now . - Just wait . - I 'll wait . It won 't wait . Okay . Okay . Okay , now either that thing is going to work or it 's not . If it 's not going to work , we can all just stand here till it reaches zero , at which point nothing will happen . However , I think it 's going to work . - Which means we have to disarm it . - How ? Cut the leads between the photo strobes and high explosives . - How many leads are there ? - Six along this strip here . Six leads , six wires . Now , the trick is , we have to cut them at exactly the same time . - And I mean exactly . - Or what ? - Shit , really ? - Come on , let 's just do it . Colonel , you 'll count for us . Give him the cutters . You 're number one , two , three , four , five ... You , over here . This one 's yours , right there . Sorry about before , kid , just doing my job , nothing personal . 300 . - Okay , everybody ready ? - Wait . I don 't have a cutter . Oh , my God . Get us another cutter from over there . Come on , come on , come on . I can 't believe this . You telling me I 'm going to die ' cause some asshole didn 't bring a pair of pliers ? I got it . I got it . - What is that ? Is that going to work ? - I hope so . 210 . Okay , I 'm going to count backward from five . - Everybody ready ? - Wait , wait . Do we cut on one or on zero ? - 180 . - On zero , like this . Three , two ... This is just a rehearsal . Nobody do anything . Three , two , one , cut . Everybody understand ? 110 . Okay . Anybody want to make a bet ? No ? Okay . Here we go , for real , this time . Five , four , three , two , one . That was interesting . What do you think you 're doing ? Letting a little fresh air in . Get away from that door . Give it up , Colonel . We blew it ! What are you going to do , make us all disappear ? Me ? And him ? And all of them ? Too many secrets . Too many secrets . Dr. Mathewson , remember Jenny ? - Hi . - Hi . - Paul ! - Mom . It 's okay . I did something . What happened ? Everything . I 'll tell you about it later . Let 's get out of here .

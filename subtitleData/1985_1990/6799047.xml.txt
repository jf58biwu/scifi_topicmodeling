 Stop right there ! Stop right there and surrender your weapon . Now you 'll see ... Ladies and gentlemen , that concludes the film portion of our presentation . I 'm sure you all have questions . So let me introduce you to the head of development for Secure-tronics Unlimited ... Dr. Stan Simon . Thank you very much . Before I open the floor , I 'd like you all to meet your brand-new security team , the Protector 101 Series Robots . One week from tonight at closing , the Protectors will begin their patrol of the mall . Paul , they look like the three stooges . Each assigned to one of the three upper shopping levels . I don 't know , Mary , the one in the middle has an unpleasantly ethnic quality . Now , are there any questions ? Yes , Dr. Carrington . So what do your machines there do besides kill criminals ? First of all , the Protectors do not kill . I wonder if they kill cockroaches . They could probably be programmed to . And merely detain intruders until the computer , located on the roof , can patch into the mall phone system and send the alarm to the police . I don 't know . That guy looked awfully dead to me . Just neutralized . Protectors can achieve this function in a number of ways . At close range , sleep darts fired from here and here can knock a man out in less than 30 seconds . However , the likelihood of an intruder gaining entry is greatly minimized by the steel security doors which are time-locked from midnight ' til dawn . Um , they seem so violent . If they 're called Protectors , what do they protect ? Plenty . For starters , as seen in the film , the Protectors do their work in the mall proper , not in the stores themselves . Maybe we could use one at the restaurant ... Get rid of people we don 't like . For instance , lasers positioned here can cut through any sort of debris . Well , that 's all very well and good , but what about those who work late ? How can your ... things there distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys ? That 's very simple . Watch . This is Simon . Bring number one on-line . Whoa ! Wow ! May I see your identification badge , please ? It 's scanning . They remind me of your mother . It 's the laser eyes . Thank you . Have a nice day . Same to you . There . You see ? The system is absolutely foolproof . Now , everyone connected with the mall has been issued an I.D. Badge so that when the mechanism goes on-line , the Protectors will make Park Plaza the safest mall in the state . Trust me . Absolutely nothing can go wrong . - Ow ! - Are you all right ? - Coffee ? - Come on , sweetheart ! Give it to me ! What do you got ? Andiamo ! Can I get two uncle Luigi bellybusters , a double anchovy pizza and an order of garlic logs ? - Gross . What Mojave brain ordered that ? - Guy over there . Oh , god . I should 've known . That orca beaches here every night . Always trying to snag some skin . Play it safe , Alison . Serve at arm 's length , if you get my drift . Thanks for the advice . Yeah . Shit ! Oh , honey , you breakin ' my heart . Look , Alison , in about an hour and a half ... We bail this barbecue and it 's good times to the Max . - You 've just got to show . - Suzie , you 've got a one-track mind . I already told you , I don 't know anybody . - Yeah , but you will after tonight . - That 's what I 'm afraid of . Would I set you up with a slime dog or something ? No way , " babe . " It is babe , isn 't it ? Come on , come on ! Take it while it 's hot . - Girls , come on ! - Yeah , all right , all right . Waitress , more butter . Attention , shoppers . In the next half hour , everything in our drapery department will be marked down 30 percent . Your attention , please . Your attention , please . We have a lost child in lingerie answering to the name of Steve . If my uncle finds out I let you do this , I 'm dead . Don 't tell me , Ferdy . Are you going chicken-shit on us again ? We already agreed . He trusts me to take care of the store while he 's gone . He ain 't gonna know diddly unless you tell him . You ain 't gonna tell him , are ya ? Don 't force me to pull rank . Oh , I 'm shaking . You know , Brennan , you 're becoming a real candidate for prickhood . - What ? - Look , guys , this party is gonna happen , but we need a little teamwork . Besides , if the place looks like shit on Monday , it 's all our asses . You got the beer ? Correct . Come on . Dude ! The fridge is packed . Good . Rick and Linda are bringing the food . Clean sheets are definitely waiting . And , uh , Suzie ... Suzie has a surprise for you . I don 't know , guys . Come on , Ferdy . Forget about your uncle awhile . This is gonna work , okay ? Ferdy , you can 't back out on us now . - Okay , okay , let 's party . - All right . First I gotta find Mrs. Flanagan 's fuchsia . You find Mrs. Flanagan 's fuchsia . - You , you hold down the fort . - I will . - I 'm gonna go find Leslie . - I 'm sure you will . Quack , quack . - Greg , I ... - Ferdy , don 't worry . I can 't find the fuchsia . Ah , fuck the fuchsia . It 's Friday . Tell the old bag to wait . Okay . Give it a try . Strike three , Walden . You 're out . My turn . It 's okay . I got it , I got it . You know the rules , buster . Into the cab . Okay , butch . You know I can 't resist it when you get tough . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Just crank it when I tell ya . - Well ? We 're waiting . - Just a sec , huh ? All right . Hit it . Always the first time . I don 't want to hear it , not another word . Me ? No way . I covered this whole deal when I said , " for better or worse , " remember ? Of course I remember . Who could forget that 40-weight stain right there on your chest ? Should 've been " for better or weird . " And speaking about weird , what about this furniture store ... Come on , Walden . Indulge me . We haven 't had any fun since we sunk all our wedding money into the business . Besides , Suzie 's counting on us . - Honey , I don 't care about ... - Okay . Okay , okay . I guess I won 't be needing this . Or , um , will I ? Attention , shoppers . Attention , shoppers . Park Plaza will be closed in 20 minutes . The mall will be closing in 20 minutes . The lower parking levels will be closed at 10 : 00 . Attention , please . Mr. Brad Trevoy to the information kiosk . You horny bastard . Can 't you wait ? No . No , I can 't . What can 't you wait for , Michael ? Mr. Todd . Uh , well , I ... Uh , I was just telling Leslie here that , uh , uh , well , that , uh ... - Daddy . He was just telling me how he couldn 't wait to take me to Suzie 's house tonight for her , um , birthday party . I see . Well , I 'm running late . You lock up ? Sure , I 'll take care of everything . Yes . I 'm sure you will . Okay , daddy . I love you too . Bye . - So , what he say ? - He said , " go out and have a good time . " All right ! That is bitchin ' . I wish I had it that easy . My parents still think I 'm a kid . Why do I have the feeling I 'm gonna regret this in the morning ? Look , Alison , you 've had yourself a very rough first week . You owe yourself a little blowout . Come on . It 'll be fun . Okay , just so long as I don 't have to look at any more pizza . You won 't . I promise . Oh , great ! This is gonna be wonderful . You won 't regret this . I bet . Attention , shoppers . Park Plaza will be closing in 10 minutes . - I am so nervous . - Hairspray , my lovely . I really hate blind dates . - Oh , yeah , audacious ! Lipstick . - Suzie ... Oh , no .

Beats being trapped in here . Who knows what they 're planning right now ? Linda 's right . We 've gotta get out somewhere we can run and get some weapons . What was that ? That 's the sound of us being locked in here all night . The security doors don 't open ' til 6 : 00 . Oh , no ! We 're never gonna get out of here ! - Yes , we are . - The phone 's dead .

Jesus . - What 's that ? - Robot blood . - Not too shabby , huh ? - We 're not finished yet . We still got two more of these suckers around here someplace . We gotta get more tanks . - What are you thinking ? - I got an idea . - Really , this is not a good idea . - Bullshit ! - Greg could be hurt . They all could . I 'm gonna find them . I 've got to . What do you think ? Well , if we gotta go , let 's not go empty-handed . Shit . I didn 't think they 'd work . Never hurts to try . - I guess not . - Give me a hand . Let 's pry this baby open . - Come on . - You know , I gotta worry . Report from the front : Ferdy 's gotta worry . - Yeah . - What if these things can read our minds ? They 're gonna be awful mad when they get to me . All right . Come on . Let 's go . - Give me the gun . - Right . Take the cap off and stuff the cloth in . - That 's it ? - That 's it . Light it and throw it . You sound like you 've done this before . Regular or unleaded , it gets the job done . Protector 1 back on-line . Hey , guys , how 's it goin ' ? Almost done , Ferdy . - You think Mike got out all right ? - For his sake , I hope so . - Right now , I 'm more concerned about the girls . - You and me both . Hey , I almost forgot . How much do I owe you for the beer ? Forget it , man . If we get out of here , you owe me a six-pack . Just make sure that those cords are good and tight . Are you sure this is gonna work ? With those things , I 'm not sure of anything . Ferdy , how 's the panel coming ? The doors work now . I bypassed the circuit . But forget about going up or down . It 's controlled by the computer . - Do you hear anything unusual ? - Only my heart beat . No ! - It 's not stopping ! - Come on ! Help me . Help me up ! Suzie ! Help me ! We 've gotta help her ! Thank you , and have a nice day . Oh , god . Come on ! You fucking bastard . Get ' em to safety ! It 's no use ! Go ! Take it ! - Now ! - Rick ! Nice shot . Dad 's a marine . According to my calculations ... provided we survive the night , of course ... we 're gonna be in hock to this place for the next 85 years . How many tune-ups is that ? Just a sec . 2,900,431 . Maybe we should raise our rates . - Hey , dead-eye . - Yo . Nice shootin ' . Thanks . Tell me one thing , though , huh ? Why did you leave the air shaft ? I mean , you were safe there . You were safe . Suzie thought you were in trouble . She just wanted to help . I 'm telling you you should 've kept her there . She told you what happened . Why don 't you just leave her alone ? Shut up . You just shut the fuck up ! Hey . Do you guys mind keeping it down ? There 's another one of those things out there , and you 're gonna bring it right to us . There 's another one ? - Why haven 't we seen it ? - Why ? I 'll tell you why . 'Cause the fucker 's out there waiting for us . He 's waiting to pick us off one by one ! But I got news for you . He ain 't getting me . Greg , you 're not thinking , man . We got destroyed by staying together . And a lot of good that did Suzie , right ? Wait . Wait . I got an idea . The master computer is somewhere on the third level . We shut it down , it shuts the robots down . Well ? It 's worth a try . Computer , huh ? Let 's go trash the fucker . - Come on , guys ! Let 's take it ! - Wait ! Slow down ! Greg , will you wait ! - Man , he 's losin ' it ! - We 're lucky he doesn 't get us all killed . - Greg , stop ! - Greg , wait ! Greg , please ! Stop ! Come on , guys ! The coast is clear ! Greg , no ! Greg ! Greg ! Thank you . Have a nice day . The first one . He didn 't kill it . Go ! Protector 3 to level 2 . Engage intruders .

Come on . - Alison , are you all right ? - I think so . - Where to ? - Escalator , third level . What about the doors ? We can 't lock them . They 'll get through . Maybe so . - Maybe not . - Let 's go ! Instructions : Attempt entry , level 3 . Affirmative . Hold it . This way . Up here . Protector 3 , level 3 . Search proceeding . Hold it , Ferdy . They could be out there . - At least we 're safe here for the moment . - Yeah , for the moment . Those things can go anywhere they want . Maybe we 'll all stand a better chance if we split up . Are you kidding ? The moment any one of us go out there , we 're dead meat , yesterday 's news . Damn it , Ferdy , will you stop it ! - Will you just stop it ! - Linda . Linda , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to upset you . - I ... - It 's all right . It 's not you , Ferdy . I guess I 'm just not used to being chased around a mall in the middle of the night by killer robots . It 's in ! - Yeah , and it won 't be long before it comes our way . - We 've gotta get outta here . Not so fast . One of them could 've doubled back . We could get picked off out there . Look , if those things want some target practice , why don 't we give ' em some targets ? Get out of here ! Ferdy , now ! Rick , get out ! Linda ! You son of a bitch ! Rick , no ! Let 's go find that computer . - Where the hell is it ? - Probably up one of these service corridors . There 's a million doors . We 'll never find it . Okay , you try over there , and I 'll try over here . - I don 't want to split up . - What can happen ? - You want a list ? - We 're wasting time . - Look , if you see anything or hear anything ... - You 'll hear me . Okay . Ferdy ! Ferdy ! Ferdy ! Ferdy ! Ferdy ! Ferdy ! Help ! Alison , move ! Get out ! Laser malfunction . Laser malfunction . Engage intruder . Engage intruder ! Laser malfunction ! Laser malfunction ! Engage intruder ! Please wait , intruder . Stop right there . - Ferdy ! - Alison , get the hell out of here ! Oh . Thank you . Have a nice day . Come on , you little bastard !

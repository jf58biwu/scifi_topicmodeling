 " Nine hundred years after the Great Nuke . The world man created , he destroyed . Out of the darkness and ignorance of the radioactive rubble emerged a new order ... " " ... and the world was woggos . " · · " ... and the world was woggos . " ( In old speak , that means — Crazy ! ) AMERICA 3000 They caught me and a bunch of others on a plugot roundup . " Plugots " are what the frauls called us then . That 's a fraul ; they ran everything . And that 's me , Gruss ; a prisoner in the comb of the Friscos . Their ruler , the Tiara , she was giving us a hot scan deciding what she was gonna do with us . I didn 't need heavy smarts to figure things were going cold neggy ; that means " very bad . " Seeder . Macho ... Macho ... Macho . Frauls called their slaves " machos . " They did all the hard work . Sure wasn 't something I wanted to be . Spirited . Seeder . Machos , mark him . Seeders were for one thing and one thing only : making baby frauls . The Tiara had picked Korvis out for her own daughter , Vena . Didn 't take much to get the frauls going ; the least little thing would set them off . Red Cross ! Red Cross ! Red Cross ! Get that plugot ! I was hot scanning for a way out . Decided to take the first offer that came along . Denver Brighton We headed straight for the old radiation zone . The frauls call it " the contams . " We didn 't know what we 'd find there , but we knew one thing : they wouldn 't follow us inside . It was against their regs ; their rules . Let 's go . It was cold hard ... but we survived . One day , Korvis and me were scrounging for something we could use . What we found would change our world forever . Uh ... not the hat ; the book . Determined to free ourselves from the frauls , we banded together in the contams . We built our own comb out of pieces of a nuked Mericans ' base called Camp Reagan . I never did figure out what a " Reagan " was . Horssse Ho-rssse ... Horse . Mmm ... Mmmaaan . Man . Man . Man ! Man ! ( I ain 't plugot . ) I 'm a man ! I 'm a man ... To the frauls , all men were plugots , but there was a difference between these hairy beasts and us . They were dumb and hungry . Really dumb and really hungry . In those days , there was neggy such thing as a free lunch . You got what you worked for . Taking charge , Vena snapped into action ! Plugots started scurrying ... but not soon enough . Meanwhile , back at the comb , things were going on as usual . Lakella , the Tiara 's second , or next in line , was sharpening up her act . A fraul was taking her final warrior 's test : trying to survive a meeting with Aargh the Awful . Fallout from the Great Nuke had forced Aargh to take a detour from the human race . One could scan he was neggy gonna find the way back . Oh my ! What 'd happen to us dear toys if anything happens to the Tiara ? Red Cross . Red Cross . Red Cross ... Lakella . Vena . My children ... closer . I 'm gone cold ... Real cold . Time 's now for new Tiara . A leader to take us from the past into a new life . It was my dream ; make it yours . Vena , my daughter , you the Tiara . Neggy , Reya . I 'm not the one ... You are now . Listen . In my shelt ... a map . Follow it . Reya , please ! I don 't want to be Tiara ! Cold . Tiara ! Sister ? I serve the Tiara . Hot . While the frauls were weeping , Korvis and me were scrounging . Scanned like some tasty leftovers . I went for the weaps ; Korvis went for the eats . He found more than he bargained for . Amie . Amie was an escaped toy . Frauls kept them as pets ; called them toys . To make plastic sure they 'd stay quiet , they cut off their tongues . To keep them jello , they cut off something else . I , Lakella , second to Vena , Tiara of Frisco , give you safe shelter . I , Freyha , second to Morha , Tiara of Kansos , accept your safe shelter . Hot surprise , ey , Lakella ? Your sister being Tiara , not you . We Kansos figured you for it . Reya 's choice , Tiara Morha . You go with it ? It 's done . You could always challenge , Lakella , hm ? The party will be soon , Tiara Morha . Lakella 's pissed at her sister being Tiara , eh ? Maybe something for us Kansos in this , huh ? Hot you made it , Tiara . Neggy miss it , Vena . Lots to talk of ... Today 's for partying , not for talking . Plenty of time for both , Vena . Today 's for partying , not for talking . Plenty of time for both , Vena . Once , the world was green , and living . Then was the Great Nuke . Death lived everywhere . All were born sick and unclean . A living curse from the Mericans and Commies . Then one day , a baby was born , clean and clear , and the living curse was over ! The child grew strong and beautiful , and she was called : Woman ! Woman taught her children to follow the Tiara , and obey the regs , and the earth lived again ! But some disobeyed the regs , and from them came the children of darkness and disease : Plugots ! Plugots to be hunted and nuked ' til neggy are left ! Vena of Frisco , solemn swear to enforce the regs , oversee the birthing and rule the comb Until the Prezzydent comes to lead us into New Tomorrow ? Solemn swear . The frauls were having a hot time . We were getting ready to give them a hot time of our own . Frauls ; hot partying , getting all loose and woggoed . Effing frauls . Nuke ' em all . Neggy , Gruss . Nuking frauls gets us nothing but nuked frauls , but , we burn their food shelts , free the machos , frauls starve . This kind of hide and seeking makes me feel cold . Well you gotta get hot on new ways , Gruss . We 're gonna be better than the frauls . We waited a long cold time ; now we set it right . Neggy more machos . Neggy more toys . Neggy more seeders ? Neggy more seeders . Just men . Aw , eff it ! Gimme another one . How do you figure it , Tiara ? Well , Vena ain 't Reya . She 's weak , huh ? And her sister Lakella — heh — wants to be Tiara , huh ? Heh , a little push here ... A little rumor there , perhaps , huh ... Soon they 'll be fighting each other like plugots in heat , huh ? And I 'll pick up the pieces , huh ? Tiara ? The map of the contams . Reya 's last wish . I got neggy choice . Well , be careful , Vena . Just because you 're Tiara doesn 't mean you can break the regs . If Lakella finds you 're going there she 'll death-challenge you for sure ! Don 't worry , Lynka , I 'll be careful ; and I got you on my side . Not much longer . My season 's here . Your season ... ? Woggos ! When ? Day next . Being Tiara 's easy next to seeding . Seeding 's a cold act , but it 's gotta be done . Well , I 'll be there for the birthing , Lynka . Solemn swear . Thanks , Vena . And don 't worry about being Tiara : I know you 're gonna be number one , real hot . Let 's go . This may be woggos . Great time to think of it . Korvis knew just how to create confidence in his men . He was a born leader . We expected the machos to greet us with open arms . We were wrong . I 'm getting Korvis . Korvis . What 's it ? Trouble with machos . Eff it . Stealing from the frauls was hard work . I needed something to cool me off . I needed some more . I 'm Korvis . I 'm a free man . You 're machos — slaves ! You like crap eats ? You like being beaten ? Treated like beasts ? We 're offering freedom . Neggy more beatings ; neggy more macho pits ; freedom . Scan it ? You hungry ? We got hot eats . There 's plenty more where that came from . Frauls took his tongue , not his head . Who 's next ? Everything was going hot plastic , until ... Come outta there ! I won 't leave any man behind ! Effing woggos ! It was downhill from there . — My break was over ; time to get back to work . — What ! ? Frauls were neggy loose and woggoed now . They were cold pissed . Going where , Freyha ? After the plugots , Tiara ! Very cold neggy , my second . This attack 's plastic for us , eh ? When I call for a union with the Friscos , they 'll jump at it . Then we 'll get rid of Vena , put in Lakella , and I 'll be riding high ! Check ? Effing frauls are gonna catch us damn sure ! Gruss , you get the men safe to camp . I 'm gonna lead those Friscos into the contams . Let me go with . Neggy , Gruss , this is my screw-up ! Another horse will make more dust . Check ; I 'll take your horse too . Stop it ! Gruss ? If they nuke me , you 're number one . Never happen . That 's what I was saying , but not what I was feeling . Trot it now , horse ! Plastic . What a day . You 're on your own . There 's only one rider here . That effing plugot tricked me ... ! Plugots got neggy smarts for tricking nobody , Vena . Tell that to the plugot , Lakella . After you , Tiara . It was not turning out to be one of Korvis ' hotter days . It scanned like the end for Korvis . I would have been weeping and wailing for my friend and leader except for one little thing . From that moment on , I gained a new respect for the written word . Now all Korvis had to do was get out of there wherever there was .

Lels was desperate . He 'd gone to the very edge of the contams searching for his missing toys . They were safe with us ; starting a new life . Ricky ? Dove ? Micky ? Where are you little toys ?

Lels knows all about the combs ! So ? I scanned Tiara Vena — the new Tiara Vena — worried about proving herself , and Tiara of Kansos wanting to be Tiara of Frisco , and Vena 's hottest friend Lynka being seeded ! Seeding ! ? Seeded ! And this , uh , Lynka hot tight with Vena ? Plastic hot , Great One , from the time they was small ! Prezzydent let Lels live for now but if Lels talks about scanning Prezzydent ... My mouth 's shut plastic tight . Solemn swear . Solemn swear ! Check , check . Now trot it outta here . Halt ! Your cart ; Prezzydent neggy need it . 'Course ... eh ... sorry . Lels believes , Prezzydent ! Prezzydent ! Okay , move ' em out . What 's keeping her ? Don 't know ! Well , it better be damn hot , making me wait like a macho ! Vena found what she went looking for . She couldn 't wait to scan Morha and Lakella her new playthings . Except ... dear Lakella knew about it already . Weaps from the Mericans ! Not the Mericans , Morha . I made ' em . We 're gonna use these ... " thunder rocks " against the plugots . You broke the regs ; you 'll bring the curse on us ! It 's me you 're fearing , Morha , not the curse . Tiara of Kansos fears neggy woman , hm ? Back at Camp Reagan , we were trying to turn the machos into men . We had a long way to go . I 'm getting cold worried , Gruss . Korvis should have been here by now . I know . And just what do we do with that Aargh thing ? It won 't go away , and it smells ... Cold ... ! What 's it , Relk ? I don 't know . It 's Korvis ! Easy , Gruss ! I brought your horse back . Neggy worry ! Neggy believe what I 'm seeing . That 's me , Relk . What 's it all ? Hot weaps from the Mericans . We 're gonna learn how to use these Merican things . Korvis , uh , try this ; it tastes cold woggos but makes you feel hot plastic . Huh . Great . Gruss , Relk ... I want you men to knock out the Friscos ' seeding camp . — Seeders ! ? — Seeders ! ? That sounds woggos to me . You said you were gonna starve them . Now , but scan this . The Tiara 's hottest friend Lynka 's being seeded now . If we can grab her , maybe we can trade her for a talk . It 'd save men some hard nuking . How you scan that ? Uh , there was this , eh ... half-fraul Lels . The Friscos ' toy keeper . He scanned me for Prezzydent . He was feared I was gonna nuke him so he hot talkied . Korvis the Prezzydent ; woggos , eh ? Yeah , that 's woggos . Would a Tiara talk to you ? Maybe not with Korvis but she 'd have to with the Prezzydent ! All of you come out here now ! Act like men , not like toys ! Trog nuked himself with the Merican weaps , scan it ? Trog did this ! Neggy spirits ! Neggy curse ! Just Trog 's screw-up ! Korvis hotter , men ! Korvis is the Prezzydent ! The Prezzydent is giving Gruss new powers ! New ways of scanning ! Hot fan-plastic ! Follow the Prezzydent ! Follow the Prezzydent ! Follow the Prezzydent ! The Prezzydent ! Follow the Prezzydent ! Follow the Prezzydent ! Follow the Prezzydent ! — Korvis Prezzydent ! Korvis Prezzydent ! — Follow the Prezzydent ! You 'll stay here while you 're getting bigger . After the birthing , we raise her . I scan that . But neggy fear , Lynka . We picked a clean seeder for you . It knows what to do and how to do it . Check , check . In the time of the Mericans and Commies , this place was called Paradise Oil Gas ; where the frauls made little frauls ; but if they had a boy , cold day ! They threw them away like last year 's eats . Just lie down and close your eyes . It 'll be all right , Lynka . You 're not the first woman to get seeded . Neggy yet . Woggos ! Hot plastic ! Fraul called Lynka ? Lynka ? Check . Hot . Take off those fraul rags , seeder . You 're free now if you want it . The Prezzydent ! In a short time , we learned to use those Mericans ' things , and Amie got a bright idea . The spirit of the Prezzydent speaks ! The Prezzydent is here now . Hot scan what I say ! Tiara of Frisco , you 'll meet the Prezzydent alone ; at high sun , go to the edge of the contams . There you 'll find your friend Lynka — safe , and unhurt . But if you disobey , then the Prezzydent 'll cold nuke all combs , just like the Mericans and Commies ! Tiara of Frisco , time 's now to change your world , or end it ! It 's a trick ! It 's a cold plugot trick ! Since when plugots sharp enough for tricks like that , Morha ? When the Prezzydent comes , she 'll be like me , a Kansos ; never plugot ! Legends don 't say what the Prezzydent 'll scan like . If talking with this ... spirit gets Lynka back , damn right I 'll talk ! Reya never would have . Reya 's cold , Lakella . I 'm the Tiara . Then act like a Tiara . Fight ! Nuke the plugots ! Neggy . I 'm gonna follow the Prezzydent 's command . So your Tiara 's gonna talk to a plugot spirit , huh ? Wouldn 't be happening if you were the Tiara ... But I 'm not . Could be ! A victory against the plugots ... That would show your comb who the real leader is , huh ? And with me behind you ... oh , you 'd be more powerful than Reya ever was . Just one thing you need , huh ? What 's it ? Thunder rocks . Easy . I know just where to get them . You 're sounding like a leader already Tiara . Fraul coming . Well ? Clean as a fraul . I was hoping for more than that . Vena ; Tiara of Frisco . Korvis ; the Prezzydent . Where 's Lynka ? What Prezzy says Prezzy does . Lynka ... I was so worried you were cold ! Or worse . Oh , Vena ! I never figured scanning you again . I 'm okay , Tiara . Nobody hurt me . You go ; go on , Lynka and keep Lakella out of trouble . Fraul 's free . And me ? I got something special for Tiara 's eyes only . What 's it ? Listen , nothing cold 's gonna happen to you ; you got the Prezzy 's word on it . Solemn swear ? Solemn swear . With Vena gone , Morha and Lakella were cooking up trouble . | ROLLING STONES | | 19 | | 89 | | FAREWELL TOUR | Something 's cold here . Tiara Vena said neggy about attacking the plugots . Check , check . And where is Lakella going before battle ? Tiaras gotta tell you two neggy , huh ? If you 're worried about fighting the plugots , you stay here with the grandma . It 's you and Lakella we 're worried about ; not the plugots . Save your heat for the plugots , huh ? Gotta tell Prezzydent . All 's gone ... cold . Neggy , neggy ... Gotta tell Prez ... Lels ?

The comb of the Mericans . I — I 've never scanned anything like this before . Prezzy shelt only thing like this anywhere . How come Prezzy scanning all this to me ? Fraul still fearing Prezzy ? Stop calling me fraul ! I 'm woman . And me ? Don 't know ... Maybe spirit ... Maybe plugot ! Neggy plugot ! You ! Put it away . If I wanted to pain you I wouldn 't have brought you here . H-How come you did ? To talk . About ? Man ... and ... woman . Man ? What 's it , man ? She was gonna find out . I am a man . Neggy macho . Neggy toy . Seeder ... ? Man . Feel : flesh like Vena 's . Heart beats : like Vena 's . Eyes , ears : just like Vena 's . Korvis ' ABC book didn 't cover this sort of thing . Two leaders had to , uh , feel their way along . What 's it , Amie ? Eff it ! Well , damn ! Korvis talks , frauls attack , and men get nuked again ! Where 's Korvis ? He had his hands full with high-level negotiations . They had reached a delicate stage . | GRENADES | | ANTI-PERSONNEL | | SMOKE GRENADES | Amie ! You 're not a fighter . You better hide now . Amie ... ! This 'll be a cold surprise for the frauls . And they had a couple cold surprises for us . Smoke ! ? Eff this ! Woggos ! Frauls ... Eff you ! Goodbye , plugot ! My hat ! Bye yourself , fraul ! " Women of Frisco ... " " ... time comes now for New Tomorrow . " Neggy . " Sisters of Frisco ... " Just super , toy keeper . Lels was still trying to get to the Prezzydent . The man was motivated . What 's it , Lels ? What 's happened ? Tiara Vena talking with Great One . Lakella and Morha attacked plugots ! Tell Prez ... Lels believes ... Gruss ... Amie ? Amie . Don 't go cold , Amie . Please ... St-Stay with Korvis . While you were talking ... frauls were nuking . Vena told me lies . Cold damn lies ! Gruss , let 's get the horses . You want revenge , Korvis ? Take it . I won 't stop you . Revenge ? Not hot enough for you ! Talking New Tomorrow and doing what frauls always done : nuking and paining ! You were tricked , and so was I ! But it 'll never happen again . Solemn swear . Effing right it won 't ! This is what you want ? More nuking ? More fighting ? Your choice , Korvis : What 's it gonna be ? I want you , Vena ! New Tomorrow starts with us . Now ... We didn 't know what Vena and Korvis were doing but the harder we scanned , the hotter it looked . Maybe there was something men and women could do with each other ' sides fighting and nuking . I was gonna find out . Well , it came without a warning , A thermo-nuclear morning , And I said to myself , " What a waste of a wonderful day ! " Well , the air was getting heavy , So I loaded up the Chevy ! I switched the radio on , but the radio wouldn 't play ... I got this cloud hanging over my head . I should never have left my bed . Was it something that I said ? If this is Paradise ... If this is Paradise ... If this is Paradise ... What have we done ? If this is Paradise ... I 'm not having any fun ! If this is Paradise ... Take me away ! Well , we never spent the nights out , 'Cause we could never turn the lights out ! The sun is always shining down , twenty-four hours a day ! Well , the last thing I remember , We came and sat there ' til December , And Christmas was another tropical holiday ... I keep on hoping this is just a dream ; That things aren 't what they seem , I thought I heard somebody scream ... If this is Paradise ... If this is Paradise ... If this is Paradise ... What will we do ? If this is Paradise ... Hey , I 'm talking to you ! If this is Paradise ... Don 't ask me when . If this is Paradise ... If you 're really my friend ... If this is Paradise ... We 'll start over again , Over again , over again , over again , Over again !

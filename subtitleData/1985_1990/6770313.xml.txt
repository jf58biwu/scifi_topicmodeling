 ( VOICES ON RADIO ) NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert ... five years ago today . The historic first view of the Newcomer ship ... upon its dramatic arrival . Their ship was a slave ship carrying 250,000 beings ... bred to adapt and labor in almost any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . Civil liberties attorneys successfully lobbied ... for the Newcomers 'release from quarantine ... and in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Lincoln ? That you ? Morning . It 's good to see a human . Getting so you can 't find a decent place to crash anymore . Damn , I hate them Slags . You believe it ? They 're trying to give them the right to vote . Shoot . They can 't even get drunk right . Whoever heard of getting loaded on sour milk ... when you can have some good squeeze ? ( LINCOLN BREATHING HEAVILY ) You don 't sound too good , Linc . You want a taste ? No , no . Why don 't you keep it , huh ? Come on . What happened to you , Linc ? What 's that slime ? Hey , look , you know , there 's a free clinic over on 3rd . We can go over there and spend the night ... Mr. Lincoln ? I 've been looking for you all night long . We were worried about you at the mission . You missed several meals and we were wondering ... Mr. Lincoln . Mr. Lincoln , please . Mr. Lincoln . No , Mr. Lincoln , please . Please , Mr. Lincoln , no . SUSAN : That goes in the second bedroom at the top of the stairs . Thank you . Honey , will you check on Buck ? Hi . Hi . That goes in the dining room , thanks . I 'm Diane Cooper , the yellow house over there . Susan Francisco , hi . A little " welcome to the neighborhood " gift . They 're beautiful . Thank you . That 's really nice of you . Mom , I don 't feel good . Emily , why are ... It 's probably just nerves , honey . This is Emily . This is Ms. Cooper . Diane . Hi , Emily . Hi . Wow , you sure look like your mom . Well , I mean , you know ... That 's okay . That goes in the kitchen . GEORGE : Susan ! SUSAN : Just a sec ! Look , I know you 're busy . My phone number 's on the card there if I can help . That could be dangerous , you know . I just might call . Do . Susan . Where 'd you put my keys ? On the box . Look at this plant a woman from across the street brought us . Mom , it really does hurt . On the box . Now that 's helpful . Emily , it 's because it 's your first day in a new school . Which box ? It 'll be okay . Why don 't you have a little bit more breakfast , okay ? Some detective ! Are you giving me a hard time ? Yes , actually . You get to go off and play cops and robbers , while I ... Have the pleasure of moving into our new house . Where did this plant come from ? God help the Police Department . I just told you . Any signs of life from that son of ours ? Buck ! Off and on ! ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) English , please , Buck . This is so awful . After all your father and I paid for this house , and all we put into it . What 's wrong ? Our property 's not gonna be worth half of what we paid for it . Why ? Why do you think , Jill ? Can 't believe you 've been gone a month already , Tuggs . Really miss you , man . At least I nailed the Slag who got you , huh ? Big deal , huh ? Now they got me working with a Slag . Can you believe it ? Morning , Matthew . Hi . What 's this ? Bran muffin . A little prune juice . Wait , you mentioned yesterday ... What are you , a poctologist ? Here , look ... why don 't you just be a good little Slag and mind your own business . Okay ? Oh , and Matthew , if I could suggest ... I really don 't care how you refer to me privately ... but when we 're questioning other Newcomers ... What ? What ? The word " Slag " equates to such words as kyke , or nigger , or gook , or wop . Well , I think you can catch more honey ... with a pound of vinegar than a pound of flies . Never mind . Oh , and incidentally , I think it 's " proctologist . " Whatever . Disappearances are no good , no photos . My editor needs something hot , visual . Yeah , like your last photo essay ? The Fish Women of Long Beach ? Sold a lot of papers . Hey , yo , Lightning . Can you dump my circular file for me ? Sure , it 's ... Trash can , Albert . My trash can . Got it ? Sure . Sergeant Dobbs . I thought all you guys were supposed to be whiz kids . I thought all you guys had rhythm . PUENTE : Good going , Albert . EINSTEIN : Sorry . I ... I don 't believe you . I ... Look at it . Look at it ! My kid had that made for me . Damn it ! Hey , Sikes , got a couple more disappearances in Slagtown . Check this out , some of these names kill me : Mort Dakota , Eleanor Roosevelt . Yeah , I guess those guys in quarantine got pretty punchy ... giving those names out to all those Slag Newcomers . Disappearances ? Well , those guys are always knocking each other off down there . I say let them . May I ? Some bum took a three-story dive on Alameda . Pretty grisly . BURNS : Grisly ? I hear grisly ? Oh , jeez ! Look at those sores . And that slime . Bag him . GEORGE : What are you thinking ? I would have jumped , too , if I had all those zits . Suicide . Come on , let 's get a doughnut . Too late , Burns , he 's in the bag . Come on , I gotta get some photos . What am I gonna tell my editor ? Beats the hell out of me . Why don 't you tell him to wrap fish in his paper ? That 's all it 's worth . I hate that guy . And the rag he works for . Should have seen the garbage he wrote about Tuggs when he got killed . Made him sound like a jerk , or ... What 's the matter ? That is a worried look . Sometimes it 's hard to tell . I just want to follow up on that vagrant 's autopsy . Whatever turns you on . DISPATCHER : All units in the vicinity of Roosevelt Elementary ... we have a major disturbance reported . Can we go there ? What ? Come on , George , I really want a doughnut . I 'll buy you a piece of spleen or something ... It 's my daughter 's school . Yes , I 'm a Purist , and I 'm proud of it . These damn Slags were bred to be slaves , so let them be slaves . They breed like rabbits , only four months instead of nine . Pretty soon there won 't be any room for the rest of us . We don 't need any more damned aliens ! We shouldn 't give them the right to vote . We shouldn 't let them into our schools . This has always been a good school . We gotta keep it that way . We don 't want her kind here . But she 's got a right to go to school . There are schools in Slagtown . She doesn 't live there anymore . Let her move back . They 're unnatural . They 're already taking too many jobs . Our jobs . If we let her in here now , there 'll be 100 more next week . We don 't want them mixing with our kids . Their quarantine wasn 't long enough . The ACLU got them released too soon . How do we know they 're really safe ? I say we run them back to Slagtown ! ( GUNSHOT ) Why stop with running them back to Slagtown ? Why don 't we just kill them ? ( GUNSHOTS ) Teach them a lesson . Keep them in their place . Keep America pure . We don 't even need to paint little stars on them to recognize them , do we ? Hell , they 'll be easy to round up . Look at them . They stand out even better than the Japs ... that we threw into concentration camps back in 1942 . This will be a piece of cake . And enough of us get together , it 'll almost seem legal , won 't it ? Put little white pointy sheets on our heads ... and hang us a few Slags , huh ? Let 's start with this little one right here . Just ' cause she 's an American citizen ... that doesn 't make her a human being , does it ? So what if she 's a little brighter than some of our kids ? We can beat that out of her . Discourage her enough , she 'll give up . So what if she might have come up with a cure for cancer someday ? She 's not civilized like us . So why don 't we just put a gun to her head ... and end it all right here , huh ? WOMAN : Somebody stop him . Come on , pull the trigger . Come on , take it ! Come on ! How about you , Ms. Purist ? I know you wanna come pull the trigger . Get down over here ! Come on down ! What , I have to do it myself ? Okay . No , we don 't want her dead . We just want her back where she belongs . She belongs here . Aren 't you ashamed of yourselves ? Aren 't you ? Anybody gives this little one any trouble answers to me , got it ? Yeah , I do . You okay ? Good girl . Now , go in there and show them your stuff . Party 's over , people . Anybody still here in three minutes ... will be under arrest for the violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . I 'm starting my watch now . NEWCOMER : They brought the body of a vagrant who 'd hung himself ... into the morgue where I work . No , a human . Sores all over him , and they looked like ... Yes . Not yet . The autopsy 's not scheduled till tomorrow . That 's exactly what worries me , too . It could be big trouble . Very big trouble . Okay . We were both proud of you , honey . I 'm not saying I wasn 't proud of you , it 's just a lot of strain for you to be under . Was it , Emmy ? They stared at me . But I figured they would , like you said . See what I mean ? It 's her first day , Sus . You have to give it a little time . You think you could do that , Em ? Yeah . I like this school . You do ? Yeah , it 's nicer than the one I went to before . It 's got bigger windows and more light , not like those trailers . And there 's a computer right in the room . Ms. Murdoch taught me how to write my name on it . Oh , and you liked that . Yeah , it was really cool . Is this your homework ? Yeah . Just math , it 's easy . Why don 't you help her with it while I make dinner ? I don 't need help , Mama . SUSAN : Hey , Buck . GEORGE : How was it at your school , Buck ? I want you to use your English name now . Please use it . How was your school ? It was okay . CATHY : That 's it . Just ... That 's it . Little more to the left . MAN : Okay . CATHY : Come on . Come on , that 's good . All right , now just a little bit to the left . Hi . I 'm ... Wonderful . Why my building ? Excuse me . Matthew Sikes ? Yeah . A woman dropped this off , asked me to give it to you . Thanks . Nice meeting you , too . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah . Matt , it 's Lyddie . Did you get it ? Hi , Lid . Yeah , I got it . What is it ? I 'm not sure . I found it buried in Tuggs ' stuff . There was a note that said to give it to you if anything ... Hey , hey , hey , hey . I saw the flowers you left him . How you doing ? Well ... You know . Yeah , I do . Well , listen , I 'll go through this stuff and let you know what it is , huh ? Okay . Matt ? Yeah . When I came back from dropping that package off to you ... I thought someone had been in the house . Why ? What do you mean ? I don 't know . Nothing was taken . Nothing was out of place . It was just a feeling . Instinct . Well , listen , keep the door locked , huh ? And call me whenever you need to , okay ? Thanks , Matt . Why is this so important ? What are you trying to tell me , Tuggs ? Hey , Matt . I heard what you did at the school yesterday for George 's kid . Tuggs would have been proud of you . Tuggs would have beat me to it . He might have . You 're not the only one who misses him , you know . Hey , Puente . Maria . Hey , Dave . How you doing ? Hey . Morning , Sikes . Morning , Captain . Hey , Sikes , you like anything at Santa Anita today ? Yeah , $ 50 on Happy Face to win in the second . You got it . Morning , Matthew . That was the morgue . That body of the vagrant we brought in ? Yeah ? It disappeared last night . I want to thank you again for how you helped Emily . Just doing my job , man . It seemed like more than that . You seemed like someone who really identified with her . Somebody who knew what it was like to be an underdog . These elevators are so slow . I knew a man once who was discriminated against ... when he was young , because he was small for his age . Made him different from the others . They always picked on him . Chose him last for teams . What ? Nothing . Susan and I sincerely appreciate it . Did you get her message ? She 'd really like to have you come over tonight . Yeah , maybe . Oh , and Matthew ... Matt . Happy Face is stuck on the outside going the mile . She doesn 't have the speed to get positioned for the first turn . But Miracle Worker , now that 's a horse . You 're from another damn galaxy and you 're telling me how to play the ponies ? Hey , Howard . Hey . So I heard you got stuck with one of them , too , huh ? Pretty , isn 't it ? I mean , how am I supposed to take anybody seriously ... with a name like Amos N. Andy ? Oh , boy . Gonzo . Who 'd want to steal that body ? Beats the hell out of me . I was gonna do the autopsy this morning . I wanted to take a look at those sores . They 're pretty delicious . Who else has access to this place ? It 's not exactly Fort Knox around here . Still , carrying a body out would 've attracted some attention . I can see why they made you a detective . ( CLASSICAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Hey , Lightning , I got some questions for you . What was your real name again ? Glenza Mantwea . He means the English name they gave you in quarantine . Albert Einstein . Perfect . You in the morgue last night ? No . Come on , don 't give me that , now . Who took the body ? What body ? Albert , I haven 't even had my coffee yet . I get real irritable . You know damn well what body . Now , who took it ? I didn 't know any body was ... Don 't ... You wanna ... Sure . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) But if you know something , it 's very important that you tell me . What ? He told me he had a right to see it . I remember from the Constitution . He did . He didn 't say anything about taking the body . He just wanted me to leave the door unlocked ... so that he could take pictures of it . He , who ? What ... Who , Albert ? The reporter , Mr. Burns . That slimeball . I 'm in trouble , huh ? I 'll do what I can . But next time you 're not completely sure how to handle something ... you come and you ask me first . All right ? Sure , George . Hi . Hi . We 're gonna play catch . You wanna play ? Sure . You ought to stick to your own side of town , spongehead . Just let it dry a little , then rub your hands together . It 'll come right off . DOBBS : Miracle Worker took it , Sikes . Miracle Worker won ? By how much ? Two lengths over Happy Face . $ 50 , brother man . Yeah , yeah . Unit 7 clear . You pick many winners ? Only about five out of seven yesterday . Five out of ... Where 'd you learn ? Looking through some of your old racing newspapers . It 's really quite fascinating , all of the variables ... the horse 's history , the running style , which track is a slow track . Man , I don 't get it . Here you are , bred to be slaves , and most of you got minds like ... Many of the slaves were required to do highly technical tasks in our culture . We weren 't all miners , or ... Yeah , yeah , okay . Who do you like in the sixth ? Morning Sunshine . Morning Sunshine ? Give me a break ! She 's been falling off every ... What 're you doing ? This isn 't Burns ' apartment . Matt ? What is this place ? Beats the hell out of me . Something to do with the vagrant 's body ? No . What , you just have a fondness for old buildings ? Or a fondness for being a horse 's ass . I hate to pry , but if you could just tell me what it is you 're trying ... Wanna pry something ? Pry that . Do we have a search warrant ? Yeah , I got your search warrant . All right , then . What ? It 's very curious . What is ? Nothing . Tell me what is curious . Tell me what we 're doing here . My partner , Tuggs , left me this file box full of stuff . I started going through it last night . Most of it seems to be research he was doing on slavery . He was black , you know . Yes . Anyway , stuck in the side ... was this piece of paper with this address on it . Well it looks like whatever was important is gone , so ... This is Puente 's beat . I 'll check with her . Okay , so now tell me what you thought was so curious . Well , when I first came in here ... there was a faint smell that reminded me of something . What ? The atmosphere aboard our spacecraft . All right , let 's get back to work . I 'm telling you I wasn 't in the morgue last night . Albert says you were . Shit , well , he 's not exactly a rocket scientist , is he ? And we found your fingerprints on the slab . What are you talking about ? I never touched it , man . I just ... Took some pictures . It was one of the ugliest corpses I 've ever seen , man . It was beautiful . So you took it ? Get serious ! I got cold-cocked . You got cold-what ? He was clubbed from behind . By who ? I don 't know . I 'm talking to some Mexican guy wearing a laundry jacket ... Where were you struck ? Right here , see . And you didn 't see who nailed you ? No . And you didn 't you report it because you weren 't supposed to be there anyway . Right . Come on , George , let 's go . Oh , and Burns ... you even think about skipping out ... I 'll find you a permanent place in the morgue . Of course , it 'd be an improvement . Hey ! Get off me , man ! Damn Slags ! I 'll get you ! So one of your trucks was making a delivery last night ... Yeah , police station 's on the schedule . Something wrong ? We think ... they might 've picked up something they shouldn 't have by mistake . Can you tell us who the drivers ... Hey ! Hold it ! RADIO : The winner was Morning Sunshine . Paying 16-30 , 10-20 and 4-80 . What , you have some money down ? Guess I should have . Anyway , where are the guys that made the pick up ? Neither one came in today . We 'll need their addresses . Where is the truck ? So will you be coming to dinner tonight ? Thanks , you know , but I 'm not really into raw beaver and stuff like that . Oh , no , Susan wouldn 't fix anything you find offensive . We would really like to express our thanks and to get to know you better . Well , I don 't know . So , George , how about football ? That 's the game with the little pointy ball . Right , the little pointy ball . You yanking my chain ? Don 't know the meaning of that phrase . Yeah . So , how do you do with picking football winners ? Only about 82 % . What ? Hand me a card . You 're kidding ! 82 % ? Yes , the body was in this truck . Here 's some of the slime that was on it . Don 't touch it . So , George , who do you like for the Rams-Cowboys game ? I 'd have to do a little research . Of course , I could tell you over dinner . You can tell me tomorrow . But the game is tonight . CATHY : Here , I 've got it . I 've got it . Don 't worry . It 's all right . I got it . It 's all right , it 's all right . I got it . I 've got it . I 'm sorry . No , I 've got it . Really I 've got it . Why don 't you let me ... No , I 've got it . Very independent . Story of my life . In the kitchen with all of this ? Don 't move . But I 'm losing my grip . Don 't move . Tell me you 're a cop . Excuse me , is something ... Are you going to be really upset with me ... when I drop all of this on the floor ? Thanks . Can I put the rest of this in ... Just a second . Are all cops this careful when they come home ? A booby trap ? Just to let me know if someone 's been here . You expecting someone special , or do you always go ... I 'll just put this in the kitchen . Yeah . You have a vase ? No . Yeah , I mean ... I 'm taking those to somebody tonight . CATHY : Lucky girl . SIKES : Married girl . Even luckier , to still get flowers . Is that your daughter ? Yeah . Then you 're lucky , too . I 'm Cathy Frankel . 204 . Matt Sikes . Yeah , I know . In your language , " sikes " means excrement and cranium . Well , it could be worse . This is terrific . Did you build this ? I 'm building it , for about a year . It 's beautiful . Is that semaphore facing the right way ? I 'm still working on it . What are you , an engineer ? A biochemist . That 's nice . Look , thanks again for your help , huh ? Sure . Sure . Do you think anybody was here ? He would have been a real professional . Do you smoke cigars ? No . What are you ... Then somebody was here . Oh , yeah , your seasoned professional always puffs away on a cigar ... when he searches an apartment . Smokers get it in their clothes . They don 't even realize it . And you can smell it even after they 're gone ? Yep . Not much hair , but I got a great nose . Listen , next time your bag 's ripping ... give me a yell . MAN : Hey , slime lover ! I was on a stakeout watching for you . Well , then you 're a good cop . One in the family is enough . Come on in , Mr. Sikes . Matt . Matt . Thank you . Emily , why don 't you put these in some water , honey ? Thank you for yesterday , what you did for Emily . How 's it going for her ? Not great , but at least you got her in the door . No big deal . Yes , it was . Look , I don 't want you to go to any trouble for dinner , why don 't I ... It 's no trouble at all , really . George is out back right now killing the beaver . It 's a joke . I wouldn 't do that to you . You really do eat stuff like that , though ? What , your bodies don 't process cooked food ? Right . Any luck on the deliveryman ? No one home at the address I took . What about yours ? The bus terminal . Swell . I thought you might want to know ... who owned that abandoned plant we stopped at . Fletcher Industries . Mean something ? Jacob Fletcher 's this lowlife Mafia type we 've been trying to nail for years . You guys want to put your guns on ? Sorry . No more shop talk . How about football ? George , let 's talk . Isn 't that amazing ? Did you make your call ? Yeah , Cowboys minus three points . It 's just an educated guess . Well , I do like your guesses . That 's nice . Do you really like it ? Yeah , It reminds me of that French guy 's work . Rodin ? Yeah . What 'd I tell you , Sus ? Susan made it . No kidding ? That 's great work . Thank you . What about Buck , Mama ? We 'll start without him , for a change . George ? ( PRAYING IN TENCTONESE ) Salad , Matt ? Yeah , sure . It 's a good week . What exactly was that ? Can I tell ? Yeah . It 's a remembrance of Andarko and Celine ... a male and female who lived a long time ago ... and sacrificed themselves to save millions . We try to live by their example . We touch our fingers to each of our two hearts ... then reverse them to show that the male and female are interchangeable . We touch our heads to bring their purity and goodness within us . Speaking of purity and goodness ... English , please , Buck . This is the man I work with , Matthew Sikes . Hey . Yeah , hi . No meat ? Not tonight . We invited Matt over tonight ... because of how he stood up for Emily yesterday . And to also thank him for how kind he has been to me ... since we started working together . Excuse me . Sus , why don 't you tell Matthew about your classes at S.C. ? Don 't you just love teenagers ? Yeah . Most of them act like me . Are you studying sculpture at S.C. ? Yes , and English Lit . And astronomy , and architecture ... She 's got more homework than me . Em ! A Renaissance woman . Well , there 's just so much new to learn . More an undecided woman . With a proud daughter . What was the reason for that ? English . ... to watch you suck up to him like that , Dad . You 're such a sell-out , buying into all this yuppie stuff . It 's better than being slaves . We still are slaves . I mean , you know how much smarter we are than Terts . Yes . So why struggle ? We 're different , Buck . It 's written all over us . There 's a natural resentment against us . So we have to be better , more patient , just to be accepted as even ... That 's a lot of junk , Dad . We should be able to be who we are without the brown-nosing . It takes time . But look at the progress already . We 're in a better neighborhood . Yeah , where half the people don 't even talk to us . Change happens slowly . But a lot of Newcomers are already crossing over ... because of their skill or their intelligence . Look at Chuck Winslow , he just signed for the Dodgers . Just PR , man . No . It 's because he is a great hitter . And how about Martine Bennett at the I.A. City Council ? Right , but does she get to vote ? If Proposition 16 passes , she will . We all will . Come on , Dad , have you seen the opinion polls ? Yes , and there 's almost a 50-50 chance . A lot of humans want us to vote . Yeah , well , I haven 't met any of them . Well , maybe you 're not looking in the right places . Come on down and have dinner with us , will you ? I 'm really not hungry . Why do you think that factory smelled like our spacecraft ? I don 't know . But I 'd sure like to find out what it has to do with Tuggs ' death . Was Matt impressed that you could smell things he couldn 't ? More annoyed , I think . He spends a lot of time annoyed . You know Diane ? The woman who brought us that plant I 'm trying not to kill ? Yeah . I saw her in the market today . She was amazed that I could smell and see the pesticides on the produce . Made me promise to pick out all her fruit from now on . Of course , the produce manager wasn 't too pleased . I heard him whisper I had a head like an overripe Crenshaw melon . You know , I don 't think they realize how acute our senses are . No , they don 't . Thanks for having Matt over . You 're welcome . You made him feel very comfortable . Would you like me to make you feel comfortable ? Well ... " Well " ? I saw you lying here with your back exposed ... waiting for a little hummer . ( SUSAN HUMMING ) ( GEORGE HUMMING ) ( GEORGE LAUGHING ) Excuse me ? I 'm sorry . I was just thinking about that X-rated video we rented . Do you remember how funny some of their foreplay rituals seemed ? Do you remember the one where ... You know what they say ? No , what do they say ? Fifty bucks I lost on the Cowboys , man ! Can 't factor the turnovers , Matt . Nobody 's perfect . Isn 't that the laundry man Burns saw at the morgue ? Excuse me , young man . Young man ! Hey . Hey ! Hold it ! Stop , you little ... SIKES : Hey ! Stop , damn it ! Damn it . Freeze . Hands on the wall . You 're supposed to back me up . I did . I anticipated his exit . He 's in custody . What if I 'd needed you inside ? I would have come right in . That 's not the damn point . He 's clean . Matt , I am sorry if you did so much running and I didn 't ... and I am sorry the Cowboys lost . All right , where is the stiff ? Don 't give me that ! Okay , man , calm down . I swear to God , I don 't know what you 're talking about . We already have your partner . Yeah . Yeah , and he 's saying it was all your idea . That 's bull , man . That guy paid us both . What guy ? One of them , man . A Newcomer paid you ? Would you recognize him ? Come on , they all look alike . What did he want with it ? I don 't know , man . You clubbed the reporter , huh ? Huh ? I swear , it wasn 't me . He 's telling the truth . What do you mean ? Well , he 's right-handed . The angle of the blow on Mr. Burns most probably came from the left hand . Yeah , see , it was a Slag that hit him , man . The one who paid you ? No , a different . He was smaller , all right ? Where is the body ? Oh , come on . If I tell you guys , you guys gonna give me a break ? Oh , yeah , sure . If you don 't , I 'm gonna take you up and I 'm gonna throw you off the roof ! No ! No , Matt , no ! Please . No , no , no , he 's going ... No , no , no ! I covered for you the last time . Hold on ! Hold on ! Okay ! Okay ! Fifth and Figueroa , man . It 's a vacant lot . I don 't get it . Show me . That one . You see , you have to carry the two up to there ... now you just hold it . And then you multiply the two ... six ... and add ... The two . Eight ! Gee , thanks . Yeah . Wow ! You 're in the gifted book already ? Talk to spongeheads and your hair will fall out . Shut up , Mark ! He 's a jerk . Thanks for the help . Sure . 10-4 . Nothing over there , either . You know , you played it real smooth back there . Fell right in with my patter . Just like Tuggs used to . Felt good . We got some nice stuff out of him . I appreciate the compliment . Yeah , but there 's something I gotta talk to you about . Dobbs just said ... that you paid the $ 50 that I dropped on the Cowboys ? Oh , yes . Oh , yes . I felt responsible for that . Yeah , well you didn 't stick a gun to my head . I lose , I pay . Okay ? Sure . All right ? Yes . You 're a funny guy , George . Do you really think so ? I 've been trying to improve my sense of humor . No , no , no , no . What I meant was ... Humor is the hardest thing to translate , though . I did hear a new joke , though . Oh , yeah ? Yes , sir . A man came up to me and asked , " Which way is it to Carnegie Hall ? " And I said , " Practice . " It 's a funny joke . Do you understand ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Practice . It 's close , George . It 's real close . You know , it might be a smidge more effective if you said : " How do you get to Carnegie Hall ? " Oh ? Trust me . " How do you get ... " " How do you get to Carnegie ? " That 's it . Keep working it . You 'll be ready to take it on the road real soon . DISPATCHER : Unit 7 request for a detective , Unit 22 , 11-4th . 10-4 . You want to drive ? Sure . Thank you , Matt . Sure . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) But if Tuggs suspected something unlawful going on in that building ... why didn 't he tell you about it ? I don 't know . Unless he didn 't have time , or ... Hey , Puente , old factory building at 26th and Fig ? Abandoned for about a year , why ? Just curious . Look , check this out . I left it where we found it 'cause it looked kind of peculiar . There . What do you make of that ? Beats the hell out of me . Looks like skin . SIKES : Human skin ? GEORGE : No . Skin from one of us . What ? Yeah , we got that got that old Slag good tonight , didn 't we ? You should have seen it , man . Johnny threw a little salt water on this slag , and he started to fizz ! Salt water burns them like acid . He must have run all the way back to Slagtown . Well , looky here . Must be a mirage . Not supposed to be no Slags around here . Excuse me . Ain 't no excuse for you . That 's my building . Would you just ... That 's your mistake , that 's what it is . Pretty fancy clothes for a Slag . Don 't you touch me . He just wants to be neighborly . Yeah , get to know you real good . Help me ! Help me ! Help ! Slag bitch ! What 's wrong ? On the ground ! Face down ! Come on , Sikes . It 's me , Johnny . We were just ... Going Slag-bashing ? On the ground ! Cathy , dial 911 on that phone . " Cathy " ? When did you turn into a Slag-lover , Sikes ? Well , I 'm glad to see you 're no model of neatness , either . Particularly at present . How you doing ? I 'm shakier now . I always knew there were people like that in this world ... but it was just hard to believe . Why ? Down at the medical center where I work , everyone is treated with respect . Human or Newcomer , it doesn 't matter . You 're valued for what 's in your head ... not the shape of it . Listen , there are some sodas in the fridge . Help yourself . No , I should be ... Will you grab me a diet something , huh ? How did you get to be a cop ? Spent so much time in jail as a kid , seemed like home . Seriously ? Yeah . Ran with a gang . This one old cop got so tired of busting me ... he got me into the police athletic league . Channeled my antisocial aggressiveness into sports . So you 're not antisocial anymore ? Just with my ex-wife . Been divorced long ? About a year . Your idea or hers ? Mine . Mine . It was time , you know . We got married too young , had our daughter 20 minutes later ... sort of missed our adolescence . Thank God , no dead beavers . No . I 'm an herbivore . Huh ? A vegetarian ? With good ears . Here . Thanks . What 's this ? You 'd call it something like a focal point . It 's part of my religion . What , like Andarko and Celine ? You know about the Celenus ? Yeah . No , mine 's different . You 'd say it 's more " Eastern . " Internal . You mean you all have different religions ? Well , of course , why not ? Good , Sikes . Weird as it is for us to have you here , must be really strange for you , huh ? Did you ever notice any distinctive smell in the air , on the ship ? What do you mean ? I don 't know , just anything different from the ordinary air ... with that spectacular nose of yours . Well , I did notice that the air was different once we got off the ship ... but I think that was just the smog . Why do you ask ? I was just curious . You know what 's always been the most curious to me ? I mean , here 's this ship , with over a quarter-million slaves , right ? And it never gets to where it 's supposed to . I mean , didn 't anybody ever notice ? You 'd think so , wouldn 't you ? Damn right ! And aren 't they ever gonna come looking ? Maybe they will . TITO : They told me they busted you , man . MARCOS : No way ! Damn those pigs ! Look , we better watch out , man . They know that we took the stiff . Did you tell them where we dumped it ? Yeah , but it was gone . I need some bail money , all right , man ? Yeah , yeah . Don 't panic . All right , well , hurry up . They got me in the tank with a bunch of Slags , man . All right ? What 's going down , Lightning ? Replacing the CO2 fire extinguishers ... Oh , yeah . ... Capt. Grazer . You guys got a problem with CO2 , don 't you ? Just when it 's concentrated . Yeah , slavery . That 's what most of the files are about . I haven 't gotten through it all yet . There 's a mountain of stuff . Tuggs ' great-grandfather was a slave . He was always studying about it . So when our slave ship landed , it gave him a first-hand opportunity . I guess so . But how does that tie into the abandoned plant in his notes ? How exactly did he die ? We spotted a robbery in progress . MATT : ( VOICEOVER ) They offed the shopkeeper , then they opened up on us . Tuggs ducked behind a car , pulled a guy out . Hi there , sir , how are you ? You mind stepping out here for a second ? We got a bit of trouble . Yeah , thank you . MATT : Then the ... The Newcomer inside switched artillery . I was pinned down . Couldn 't give him cover . Some partner , huh ? I 'm sure you did the best you could . Yeah . Anyway , Tuggs ran out of cover . MATT : Back up against the car . The last shell went right through him . Awful . Did you actually see it ? No . By the time I got to him it was over . I 'm very sorry . Yeah . The autopsy showed that he died from that wound ? What ? Was there an autopsy ? He had a three-inch hole in his chest . You think he died of an ingrown toenail ? ( LOUD CRASHING ) DOBBS : Stupid idiot ! EINSTEIN : I 'm sorry . Sikes , that stuff you found was Slag skin ... and my trusty assistant , Stepin Fetchit , verified it himself . What about the slimy stuff from the laundry truck ? That 's pretty weird crap , but we are working on it . Did you do an autopsy on Sgt. Tuggles ? What ? Did you do an autopsy on Sgt. Tuggles ? Hey , gotta roll on 602 . They want you there , too . Hi . Hi . Hello . It 's nice to see another head like mine . I didn 't know anybody else lived around here but us . You live around here ? Yeah . Third house up on the right . Well , I don 't . WOMAN : Miranda , get on up here , girl . I suppose you 're going to tell me the bus was late again . Yes , ma 'am ... Never mind . Just get inside and get to work . And what did I tell you about not bringing your friends along ? You get along , missy . You 're probably late for your job , too . What have we got ? Another lovely . Just like the vagrant . No , doesn 't look the same . GEORGE : What is that smell ? LEE : Formic acid . He 's ... He 's right . These aren 't infectious sores like that bum had . They 're acid burns . That 's what killed her . Never heard of formic acid . Formic . Formicadae , Latin for " ant . " It 's ... It 's found in ants , yeah . In a few other insects as well . Anybody see anything ? Yeah . I only seen bits and pieces of it in the shadows . But it was like something out of a nightmare . What ? Excuse me . Black . Part shiny . About seven or eight feet tall . With pincer kind of things on its face and six arms . Come on . MAN : It did not have six arms . Thank you . Now ... It only had four . And it wasn 't all shiny , either . Parts of it seemed sort of bristly-like . All right , let 's fan out . Cover this whole area inch by inch . Puente , let 's get a couple more units in here . ... a real danger , I 'm telling you ... Yes , you said that again and again ... Mrs. Brett , but if you 'll forgive me , it sounds a little hysterical . It 's not hysterical . What we Purists stand for is very simple and very wholesome . We don 't want our kids polluted by their kind . And you 'll use force , if necessary ? We are committed to using whatever means necessary . All right . But Dr. Hurwitz , is there any sort of medical basis for Mrs. Brett 's claim ... that the Newcomers could be carrying a virus ... that makes AIDS look like chicken pox ? We have no evidence that such a virus exists . But , it could exist ? Well , there are those of us who argued that the quarantine period ... may not have been sufficiently long enough ... to thoroughly isolate extraterrestrial bacteria . But we were overruled ... So , such a virus could exist ? That 's exactly why we should never have let the damned aliens out . And now this elitist conspiracy to give them the vote ... Can we please stick to the subject we agreed upon to ... Don 't you tell me what to stick to , you filthy Slag . Excuse me ... Just sit the hell back down there , boy . We want some straight answers and we want them now . ANNOUNCER : And once again the two newest additions to the Warriors proved that their skills ... could leave their opponents in the dust . Chip Weston and Nicholas Nickleby led their team ... to a staggering 113-to-75 upset over Southwestern ... prompting coach Jim Harris to quip that other teams ought to be allowed ... to play with seven men against UCM . I talked to the two Newcomers after the game . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) NEWCOMER 1 : ( ON TV ) Are you kidding ? NEWCOMER 2 : All the guys ... It 's a great team . Hey , Em . I got something out of the stuff we use for drama club . I thought it might make you feel better . I 'm not sure . Go on . Try it . How do you put it on ? Like this . What do you think ? Well ... I think it 's hysterical . PUENTE : Over here . PUENTE : What is it ? PUENTE : What is it ? MATT : Look at that . Looks like something came out of the skin and dragged itself away . MATT : What the hell happened here , George ? George , this looks like there was some kind of damned ... Metamorphosis . What 's going on here , George ? I don 't know what to say . I 've never seen anything like it . You haven 't ? Look at that skin . That 's one of you , or was . What was inside it , George ? I don 't know , Matt . Hey , level with me . What was inside it ? Is the same thing inside all the Newcomers ? Good God . Is the same thing inside of you , George ? Is it ? How can it be ? I don 't know . You tell me . Matt . Tell me , you damned Slag ! WOMAN : ( VOICEOVER ) You 're probably late for your job , too . Hi , honey . Listen . We 've got to talk . Emmy had another rough day . And Buck 's school called . He 's never been there . George , wait . I want us to talk to him together . What ? Listen to me , you little ingrate Slag . I 've been working my tail off to give you a better life ... so you don 't have to live like a slave . And I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna let you blow your chances ! You listening to me ? Yeah , Dad . I am . All right . If I catch you ditching any more school or running around ... with any of those smart-ass hoods , I 'll have your head in a bucket . You got that ? Yeah , Dad . Sure . You got that ? Yeah . ( BUCK MUMBLES ) What ? You don 't want to hear it . You got something to say , you say it . I think you 're just dumping on me 'cause of all the crap at your job . I 'm dumping on you because you 're turning into a little screwed-up Slag ... who 's ditching school . And because crap rolls downhill . Go on , Dad , but just remember , I didn 't , like , ask you to move here . I didn 't , like , ask you to sell your soul to the Terts . ( PHONE RINGS ) Yeah , hello ? MAN : Is this Burns ? BURNS : Yeah . I 've seen it . Seen what ? Who is this ? The thing that crawled out of the skin . I 've seen it . Where ? You pay me ? If it really is something . It 's something all right . But you better hurry . Where are you ? First and Santa Fe , down by the bridge . But you better hurry . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hi , this is Cathy . Hang on . Leave word after the beep . Hello ? Cathy Frankel ? Jelana Vray ? ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Who is it ? It 's me , Sikes . You got a sec ? Sure . What is it ? What does this word mean ? ( READS IN TENCTONESE ) Tuggs heard it from some of you . Said it frightened them . " Kleeze-antz-un . " What is this paper ? My partner was working on this before he got killed . He was always interested in slavery . He used to say he was going to write a book someday . Guess he got to talking to some of you about being slaves . He couldn 't understand why you were all so ... Here it is . " One of the most curious aspects of Newcomer slavery was ... " " their apparent submissiveness . " Yes , we were ... completely submissive . Why ? We just were . Since then , I 've often wondered myself . I can 't imagine being that way now . I can 't imagine being that way at all . " None of them remembers any example of revolt among the slaves . " " Such as Spartacus among the Romans , or Nat Turner in America . " " What 's more , none of them could remember anyone to revolt against . " Is that right ? Yes . So who ran the ship ? Who were you slaves for ? We never saw anyone but ourselves . We never found out who were the ones who were flying the ship ... because it blew up so soon after it got here . Of course , whoever was in charge could have just blended in with the rest of you . If they looked like us , yes . So what about this word ? It 's a very old word . Meaning ? It 's difficult to translate . Tuggs was right . You are frightened of it . Guess we are . It 's strange . It 's a very deep fear . It 's like a child being frightened of the dark . Why ? I don 't know . I really don 't . It 's almost subconscious . So , what does it mean ? Well , there are really two meanings . One would be like " lord over " ... or " seeing over . " Overseer ? That 's what they called the men who kept the slaves in line back in the 1800s . You said there were two meanings . What was the other ? Demon . In there ? Yeah . Must have gone back inside . I see it around the outside . It was dragging something . Dragging what ? I don 't know . Might have been a body . How long ago ? Just before I ... Somebody , please help me ! Somebody , help ! And that 's all you saw ? Hey , that 's enough . Don 't you think ? They ever find that other guy ? GEORGE : No . Not yet . Good photos , huh ? Yeah . You ever see anything like that ? I haven 't . Mr. Burns , I 'd like you to consider asking your publisher not to print these . There 's something dangerous out there , pal . The public 's got a right to know . I just think until we ... Forget it . We already got a special edition hitting the streets right now ... and it 's already on the wires . Matt , I have an appointment this morning . I 'll be back at the station shortly . Better watch out for him , man . We better watch out for all of them . ANCHOR : ( ON TV ) And since the release of these photos ... reactions have run from humorous skepticism to outright fear . Opinion polls show a major drop in those who are for Proposition 16 ... which would give a new species , the Newcomers , the right to vote . Critics of Newcomers have been very outspoken . We have every reason to be frightened . We haven 't encountered their kind before ... and we 've yet to know how different they may be from us . Hi . Hi . I wanted to bring you these . They 're from the plant that you brought the other day . Great . Thanks . I was really pleased . I usually have sort of a black thumb . I just look at a plant and it keels over . I 'm sorry , I left somebody hanging on the phone . Well , sure . Thanks again . Yeah . MANAGER : Right down this way . Getting a cold , huh ? Yes . Just got over one . Ain 't one thing , it 's another . You see that bug story they 're laying on us ? What a load . Here it is . Poor guy . What was his name ? Sgt. Tuggles . Yeah . Tuggs . Didn 't have a chance . Just look at them holes . One down there is where he bought it . You know , you 're lucky it 's still here . Order came down to scrap it a week ago . I 've just been too busy . Who signed the order ? Don 't know . I have to track it down . Would you ? Sure . You take care of that cold . Matt . Another report of Slag-bashing . Do you mind ? What can I tell you ? You can tell me it 's an assault . Sikes , is this what you had in mind ? Yeah , it 's perfect . Here , try these on . What 's this for ? Something the matter with you eyes ? What is this for ? Taking you to a dress-up affair tonight . I want you to fit in . If that 's possible . What 's wrong with your eyes ? I have a cold . What are you talking about ? When you have a cold , you have a runny nose , you sneeze . We blink . Come on , give me a break . Hate to see what happens when you 're constipated . When we get constipated , we go into cataleptic fits . We usually grab the nearest human , particularly if he 's a smart-ass cop ... and we throw him out the window . I can 't help being a Newcomer any more than you can help ... having a skull full of manure . So let 's try to overlook each other 's peculiarities , shall we ? What 's this ? I found it inside the car Tuggs was hiding behind . What ? It came from in front , not from behind . I think it 's the bullet that killed him . Too bad they weren 't aiming at you . What a kidder , huh ? What 's the problem ? Just what happens when you promote them , Captain . They get uppity . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) You picked the wrong place to hunker , Slags . How about a little salt water , spongehead ? Let 's get out of here ! THUG : You 're dead , Slag ! BUCK : Don 't . Please ! ( NEWCOMERS SCREAMING EXCITEDLY ) ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) Jelana , please . I assure you , it 's a matter of great importance ... or I never would have come . Please , put the past behind us . It 's truly a matter of life or death . Most probably death . Maybe the girl , Jill ... Yeah . Maybe the girl , Jill ... Yeah . Maybe she was trying to help you before when she gave you the wig . But then she laughed with the rest of them , Daddy . Yes , and that hurts , I know . I feel badly at work sometimes . I get a little bit angrier than I should . It 's going to take some time . But it 'll ... It 'll change , you 'll see . Do you have much homework ? A little . About Indians . I want to hear about that . Hey , Mom , how 's it going ? About like usual . Give me that jacket . What 's this gunk you got all over it ? I don 't know . It 's slime . Hey , Dad , be down in a sec , okay ? Sus , we 've really both got to get together ... George . What ? It 's hard for me sometimes at SC ... but at least I 'm older . Does everyone treat you so badly ? No , of course not . And those that do , I can deal with . But Emily 's only nine years old , George , and I hate it when people treat her ... So do I , Sus . But ... Em ! Mamma ! You dirty Slags ! We don 't want you here . SUSAN : Emmy ! Are you okay ? Get out of here . We don 't want you here ! WOMAN : We don 't want any insects around here ! Do you see ? Damn it . No . Don 't start . It 's not worth it , George . Nothing is worth this . I don 't want my kids to go through this anymore , do you hear me ? I want to go back . I 'd rather live in that Slagtown hovel for the rest of my life . And what about their lives ? And their children 's lives ? It 's not worth it . Not to me . Not for my kids . Hey , Matt , George just called . He said he won 't be in till later . Yeah , I figured . He told me what happened . Can you believe what they did to his house ? Yeah , I can . God . I mean , I thought I 'd been through some really rotten stuff . You know what it 's like growing up a poor Latina in a preppy neighborhood ? Hey , Chiquita , want a banana ? Nice . Yeah . I was always being hassled . But these Purists , I mean , they should be strung up . After a fair trial , of course . Of course . Hey , Sikes , you have fun playing homeless last night ? Oh , yeah , almost as much fun as playing Captain . Hey . I 'm sorry they promoted me and not you , okay ? So what about this insect thing ? You and George see any bugs last night ? No . I was out on my own . He had a problem at home . Now it sounded like you two had a problem here yesterday . Is that what this is about ? No . I want an autopsy on Tuggs . What ? He 's dead and buried . They never did an autopsy on him . Come on , you saw him . So did I. What 's a ... What 's an autopsy gonna show ? Can I order one , Capt. Grazer ? Sure . Thanks . I 'd like to see the principal . You must be Emily 's mother . How 'd you guess ? We all know which one she is . Can I tell Mr. Stevens what you want to see him about ? Withdrawing my daughter . I 'm sorry to hear that . Well , he 's in a meeting right now . If you 'd like to wait ... Yes , I would . TEACHER : Can I talk to you a minute ? I was just thinking when it used to be three kinds of rest rooms . Three ? Men , women , and colored . Really ? I 'm old enough to have seen them . But things do change . They really do change ... if you want them to badly enough . I remember this old black woman , Miss Jane Pittman . She used to pass a particular water fountain every day . The white folks ' fountain . You know what she did one day ? She went right up to it and took a drink . But , Lord , all hell broke loose when she did . " A nigger took a drink out of the white fountain . " " A nigger done this , a nigger done that . " One became the Mayor of Los Angeles . One became the Mayor of Atlanta . Atlanta ! And one ran for President . One will be President , someday . But it 's hard to take that first drink . It take lots of courage to be like Miss Jane . At least they weren 't afraid she 'd turn into an insect . Honey , I can show you people today ... who still think black people have rabbit blood and Jewish people have horns . You don 't look like no cockroach to me . Take a drink . Late date ? I 'm working undercover . Listen , Matt , I really need to trust you . Can I ? MATT : What ? You stole him out of the morgue ? You and what 's-his-name ? Amos N. Andy ? We had to . MATT : What the hell are you 're talking about ? You can 't just ... We were afraid he might be highly contagious . With what ? Bolanicus . It attacks the skin surface and then it attacks the neurological system . In our people , the disease can be dormant for a very long time . But in your people , it 's obviously more virulent . But in your people , it 's obviously more virulent . MATT : You guys have a lot of it ? CATHY : We haven 't seen it for decades . Much like your smallpox . RAMNA : Until your people placed us in quarantine . The sweltering proximity , the poor sanitation ... Why the hell didn 't you go to the coroner about it ? Don 't you think that we have enough prejudice against us already ? Ramna , please . Now they may have made a mistake . That 's why I brought you here . They were just trying to handle it quickly and quietly . We 're already working on a vaccine . But I needed your opinion on how to proceed . We got to get somebody down here right away ... from the Center for Disease Control . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Listen , pal ... CATHY : Ramna , they are scientists just like us . They may look different . But inside they feel the same way we do . CATHY : What else ? I 'll start with that . But level with me . Does this stuff turn you guys into insects ? Oh , for Andarko 's sake . Of course not . Matt , I understand your fear . We were bred to adapt and evolve quickly . But I just can 't imagine how that insect creature ... could have come from one of us . GEORGE : I hate the way these clothes smell . MATT : Yeah , but maybe the smell will attract that insect thing . MATT : All right . MATT : So Tuggs was doing research on why you all were such submissive slaves ... hears about these Overseers who may have been in charge of you ... gets an address of some plant owned by a slimeball underworld type . Yes . Which smelled like the inside of our spacecraft . Right . Somebody kills him and makes him look like he died in action . Maybe . Did they exhume his body ? Yeah , autopsy tonight . MATT : Let 's go down this alley . GEORGE : There is nothing down there . It 's pitch-black down there . How could ... You see as well as you smell ? Yes . Let 's try over there . All right . But listen , you got to shuffle . All right ? Shuffle . Like this . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) What 're you doing here ? My mom went out to one of her stupid Purist meetings . And I wanted to say I 'm sorry . You made me put on that wig just so they all could laugh at me . No , really . I thought it might make you feel better . More like one of us , you know ? It just didn 't work . Yeah , it was a dumb idea . I can 't be something I 'm not . Well , anyway , I just wanted you to know I felt bad . Thanks . My mom doesn 't want me to play with you . Yeah , okay . But I want to . We could play at your house or in the park . She wouldn 't have to know . If you want . You 're not blinking so much . Your cold 's better ? Yes , thank you . Good . So who sent down the order to have the car scrapped ? Captain Grazer ? Yes . What ? Formic acid . Holy ... Look at that thing . ( CREATURE GROWLING ) This is 13 . We 've got a target in the factory yard , 1200 Alameda . Send backup and Air 10 . MATT : Come on , we 're gonna lose it . GEORGE : Like hell . ( GEORGE SPEAKS IN TENCTONESE ) English , George . Never mind . GEORGE : Where 'd it go ? Beats the hell out of me . ( CREATURE SNARLING ) ( MATT SCREAMS ) Acid ? Yeah . Hold on . This is alkali , it 'll cut the acid ... What ? Is that a piece of it ? Son of a bitch . Son of a bitch ! Matt ! MATT : It 's Velcro . GEORGE : What ? MAN 1 : My arm . MAN 1 : Hurry up , damn it . Hurry up ! MATT : Killing Newcomers just to use their skin . You son of a ... Stop fighting or die . MAN 1 : All right , don 't shoot . MAN 2 : Bernie ? Bernie ? Are you here ? Answer him . Answer him . All right . Over here ! What the hell happened ? GEORGE : You 're under arrest . Did you hear me ? Walk this way . Leader of the Purists . Well , Mr. Purists , you have won the right to remain silent . You choose to give up that right , everything you say ... " Anything you say can ... " Anything you ... Thanks . MATT : More important than exposing the hoax about the bug ... is that we got to nail these guys . Killing Newcomers just to make it look like ... something crawled out of their skin . What a sick bunch of ... Take a look at this . What ? Autopsy report on Tuggs . " In addition to the major wound sustained through the back , there was another ... " " There was another , much smaller entrance wound through the chest ... " " piercing the heart and exiting the back . " Made by the bullet you found . Full metal steel jacket , .308 caliber . That 's what the SWAT teams use . Yes . He may have been assassinated by a police weapon . No witnesses . Where are the damn witnesses when you need them ? Maybe there was one . What ? Who ? Didn 't you say Tuggs pulled someone out of that car ... just before he got killed ? MATT : That 's right , he did . Let 's find him . SUSAN : George . I 've decided to let Emily stay in the school . For a little while longer , anyway . You 're smiling , aren 't you ? Yes . Well , I might change my mind again tomorrow , so don 't press me . No , I won 't . You must be pretty happy with yourself , after last night . Just another creature that wasn 't real ... and there 's nothing seriously wrong . Well , I 'm proud of you . Excuse me , Sergeant ? Yeah , what do you want , Lightning ? I didn 't do too great a job , but here . There 's still a few chips . I couldn 't find them all , but ... It 's fine . You did a good job . Do you really think so ? Yeah . Look it . Good as new . Thanks a lot . You 're welcome . And I will try to be more careful . Damn it . Albert ! Yes , Sergeant ? Thanks , man . You 're welcome ... man . This the guy ? Ronald Ketnes , this is my ... Matt Sikes . Hi . You 're the one that Tuggs pulled out of the car just before he got killed ? Yeah . Did you see who shot him ? Yeah , I guess so . You guess so ? He saw someone on a rooftop and thought he was working with you and Tuggs . Why ? It was a cop . I thought he was aiming way too low , you know , but ... And then he was gone before all the other shooting was over . Why didn 't you say anything before ? It was until he told me what happened that I put it all together . He is going through files now trying to make a face . What ? Another cold ? No , I just hate the smell of cigars . PUENTE : ( VOICEOVER ) You have to understand something about me . Before I was a cop , I was a guard . At the Women 's Prison in Chino . You can 't imagine the kinds of things that go on there . What women would do to other women . Particularly , if they find out that a woman was a guard . Or a cop . The Overseers . Yes . I can tell you about the Overseers . When they were on the ship , they used a special gas in the atmosphere ... to keep the slaves submissive . When the ship crashed , they snuck away amongst the slaves . They found some underworld connections to manufacture the gas ... to use on whoever they wanted to control . I found out they were making it in that factory on my beat . And I went on the take . To keep it quiet and to keep others away , they paid me a lot . A lot . Then , Tuggs 'research led him to figure out the truth about them ... and me . He gave me 24 hours to give myself up . But I had seen Chino , man . And I knew what they would do to me in there . I couldn 't go in there , Matt . I couldn 't . Why didn 't you let me die ? Why didn 't you let me die ? ANNOUNCER : ( ON RADIO ) And since the discovery that the insect-like creature was merely a hoax ... concocted by radical Purists ... the opinion polls have swung back the other way ... showing about 54 % of the population now willing to pass Proposition 16 ... giving Newcomers the right to vote . Doctors at Queen of Angels Hospital this morning ... were still keeping a close eye on that 16-year-old black youth ... who was wounded in a gang-related shooting yesterday . The boy remains on the critical list . Authorities are still looking for his assailant ... believed to be a member of a rival Newcomer gang . On Wall Street at this hour , the Dow Jones is up six points in active trading . You could have used the word " partner . " What ? You could have used the word " partner . " What ? At the station , with that Ketnes guy , you could have told him I was your partner . Are you sure ? Yeah . And another thing . Sorry I called you a Slag . Sorry about the manure line . Speaking of manure , where do you wanna have lunch ? Beats the hell out of me . Actually there is this little place in the East Side ... I 've been meaning to try . It serves a really nice ring-tailed sloth . Yeah . It 's a good joke .

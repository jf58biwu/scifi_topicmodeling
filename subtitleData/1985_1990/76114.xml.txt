A çvery weird , bizarre , vivid , erotic , wet , detailed dream . Maybe we haçve malaria . Shit . Gary ! Wyatt ! Breakfrast ! I don 't haçve the bucks to pay Chet off about this . You can 't fear Chet the rest of your life . Why not ? Please ... I don 't know , Wyatt . I mean , it 's seriously affecting your sex life . 10 seconds into my gymnastics routine , you passed out .

I really don 't know how to say this . You guys found girlfriends , right ? Fell in love with two girls . They frell in love with you . That 's all I eçver wanted for you . You 're not hurt ?

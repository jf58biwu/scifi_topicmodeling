 It 's still hot , sir . The time machine was activated about an hour ago . This is a serious breach . If a time traveler survives it , consequences could be catastrophic . I feared this . Have the men in the field found the device ? There still looking feverishly , but we 've only had a little under an hour . They haven 't dug anything up yet , but they 're still looking . Then we still don 't know if she 'll succeed . Dr. Henderson . I came as fast as I could . This is terrible . Professor , we have the coordinates . 20th century , Schuster College . What if the time traveler finds his target ? Our time traveler is unaware of his target 's secret identity . He 'll be looking for someone from Schuster College . One out of thousands . It 'll take time . At least you have his name . I can 't believe I 'm actually going to meet Clark Kent . What an honor to be chosen . Serene , you must not discuss the future with him . He 's young , still vulnerable . A wrong decision could alter the course of history . You 'll need this to track him . You have one chance to succeed . If you fail , this whole world could be destroyed . How about Martin Clure ? Grunt ? I don 't think he 's learned to finish a sentence yet . I know , I could set you up with Jack Borden . Mr. Biology ? Gimme a break . The guy wears chloroform for aftershave . I 'm holding out until Mr. Right comes along . Whoa . My gosh . Who 's this guy ? Oh . I 've been answered . Gloria . Are you busy Saturday night ? I have no use the female of your species ? How could a man break through solid bricks ? Suddenly he appeared , right out of thin air . And before I could introduce myself , he smashes right through that wall . Only Superboy could do that . It wasn 't Superboy . I wish . Are you busy Saturday night ? Clark , stay away from women . She wants to play ball with you today , yes . But tomorrow she will trade you from the team . Did the intruder have any other unusual characteristics ? Well , he was tall and handsome and strong . Kind of like you , only without the glasses . Are you busy Saturday night ? Andy , is there something wrong ? No , there 's nothing wrong . Why do you ask ? Well , you seem kind of quiet and distant . And two girls in shorts just walked by , and you didn 't even whistle . Oh , yeah , that . I 've given up women . Hah . I find that pretty hard to believe . Yeah , well , you can blame it on christie . She dumped me for a guy in her English lit class . I can 't believe she fell for that poetry crap . And he 's got a zit on the end of his nose . Andy , sometimes love transcends the physical . What is that , a joke ? Clark , I just don 't know what women want from me . What is it ? What do they want ? Well , Andy , I don 't know . But do you think it 's possible in some miniscule way that sometimes you come across just a little bit too strong ? Clark , I 'm inspired . I 'm really glad , Andy . Not by you . Guys , guys , I want you to meet someone . She just transferred to schuster . This is Ser ... Hi . I 'm Serene . And I 'm in heaven . That 's me . That 's just a joke . I 'm Andy . Nice to meet you , Clark . Do we know each other ? No . But I know a lot about you . What I mean is I 've read your stories in the school paper . You have a great future . You really think so ? Are you a journalism student ? I 'm considering it . I 'd like to learn more . Maybe you could give me a few pointers . I 've got a story I 'm working on . I mean ... That would be neat . I just changed my hair , it 's a new Elvis thing . Do you like it ? I was wondering . You wanna come over and see my new bug collection ? How about dinner on my yacht ? Some champagne , some French fries , you know . How about coming over to look of my revised edition of the encyclopedia ? I have a Cadillac convertible . I have a 20 megabyte hard drive . Excuse me , guys . I 'm sorry to break up the party , but we 've got class . Okay . I 'll just entertain , Serene . We didn 't shake . I 'm Andy McAllister . Kind of a freelance , good-looking guy . You wanna spend a weekend together ? Maybe some other time , Mr. McAllister . Okay . I 'll wait . No problem . Whew . What ? Have a nice day . Okay . Blood pressure 120 over 80 . Temperature 98.6 . Humans . Pathetic design . You know , Clark I think I 'll take things slowly with serene , not rush it . Wait maybe two , even three days before I make her my wife . I 'll get it . What ? Serene . Listen , I was thinking maybe if you 're not busy tonight , we could go anywhere and do anything . Maybe some other time . Clark , can we talk ? Sure . Can we go someplace private ? I 've got this deadline . I can 't wait . She can 't wait . Okay . I 'll just stay here and get this developed or something . Would you like something to eat ? No , thanks . I thought you wanted to meet somewhere in private ? We need to blend into the crowd , Clark . Hungry ? I mean it 's still good . Someone is looking for you . You are in great danger . Who 'd be looking for me , other than my editor , if I don 't get that story in on time ? I 'm not talking about humans , Clark . I 'm talking about a 4th level MX307 Android . It may look like flesh and blood . But it 's a machine with powers equal to Superboy 's . A state of the art killing machine , programmed to destroy you . Who are you , Serene ? A friend , who 's come a long , long way to warn you . The android is from the future . It was designed by brilliant scientists . We don 't know what its total capabilities are yet . But we do know it was sent here to kill you , Clark Kent . Why ? I mean you who 'd wanna kill me ? The sensing device . He 's here , Clark . We must find a place where it 's safe , until we can find a way to defeat it . Well , if he 's as dangerous as you say , I 'd better go contact Superboy . No , Clark , you don 't understand . This way . That guy 's a psycho . I 'll stand by your side , Superboy . You know who I am . Now it 's time to put the heat on you . I will enjoy watching you melt , Boy of Steel . I can 't let this happen . The Android is too powerful . We must go where it is safe , until we can find a way to defeat it . Where are we going ? I know a place . Come on . What is this place ? This 'll be known as Sector 8 . It 'll be Metropolis ' largest planetary transport cell . Come on . But why is this android after me ? He was designed by a small but very powerful group of scientists . They sent it down to destroy you . So you will never have any descendents . I have descendents ? I 'm gonna get married , have children ? With who ? Lana ? All I can tell you is that it is your descendents who protect the future . They are the only ones who can stop these evil men from destroying our world . Serene , you have most of the same powers I do . Does that mean you 're one of my ... No more questions , Clark . Our destiny is now . Don 't let your emotions rule you . Concentrate all your powers on defeating the android . If you die , the future dies with you . What else can you tell me about the android ? One thing we do know is that when he has carried out his mission , he 's programmed to self destruct . So there will be no evidence of his existence . Clark , he 's somewhere in the plant . Lana ? Hello , Clark . What are you doing here ? I followed you here . I was worried about you . This is not what it looks like . Serene and I are on a ... On an assignment . A very dangerous assignment . You shouldn 't stay here , you should leave . The sensor , Clark . He 's close . You don 't really want her , do you ? Lana , I ... I 've always loved you , Clark . I thought ... I never ... I thought we were just friends . I just never knew how I felt until another woman came in line . I ... This really isn 't the best time . We could have a great future , you and I. I know everything about you , Superboy . Kill her , Clark . She 's the android . Hahahahaha . I 'm a superior energy force . It 's futile to resist . Prepare for your termination . You 're less frail than I expected . But it is unfortunate that your maker had no access to the latest technologies . I won 't let you destroy him . My computers have scanned his body . His vital signs show no heartbeat . No brainwaves . My mission is accomplished . The Boy of Steel is dead . No . Superboy . No . He 's dead . I failed . Don 't cry , Serene . I 'm fine . I don 't understand . You were dead . Almost . I took a chance that the android wasn 't programmed to know that I can make my heart beat so slow that I can appear to be dead . So he thought his mission was complete . And self destructed . That 's right . I figure the best way to destroy him , was to let him do it for me . You were brilliant , Superboy . Your descendents will be proud . And what about your future , Serene ? Goodbye , Superboy . Wait . Serene , where are you going ? I 'm sorry . I wish I could have been somebody who could love you . Would you bury this with me ? What ? My mission is also complete . I 'm an android too . No , Serene , no . You could have told me so much about my future , Serene . Now I 'll never know . Professor . We 've just found it . They dug it up in Sector 8 . So she did succeed . I 'll be back . Hahahaha . Captioned by Grant Brown

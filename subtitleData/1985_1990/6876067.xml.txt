Now it 's my turn ! Wow ! You 're pretty good , Ricky ! How could you ? ! Didn 't ... do it ... on purpose ! Ow ... Wasn 't on purpose , I said ! In the city of Ruben , the capital of the Republic of Sirius where an upcoming 4-nation inter - planetary summit will seek answers to the deadlock over joint control of Planet Barbara the army has put down a riot by those opposing the autocrat Hellenist . It is believed that this will have a disastrous effect upon the inter-planetary summit , scheduled to convene in 10 days . The images shown here have been secretly transmitted by our reporter . Hellenist , once honored as the founder of the nation , is now alleged to be the evil mastermind of a corrupt dictatorship . As if to support that claim , the riots are occurring on a daily basis . Our coverage of this fast-breaking story continues with ... Hmm ... I guess there are people like that in the world heroes who get drunk with success and power , and eventually go nuts . Hmm ... ? Gee , Halos , you 're actually a man ! Looks like you 're enjoying it a little , eh ? Leave me alone , won 't you ? If you mock your elders , the gods will smite you ! El ' , Say , Miss ... E Yes ? r , says Miss " This gentleman here says he wants to ask you out tonight . Just kidding , of course . Say , could you get me a Cognac Cocktail ? Certainly . Joe ... Whoa ! The news ! The news ! ... concerned with the current situation in Sirius , the United Space Force has announced that they will be deploying forces to the region to prevent an inter-planetary war from taking place in the event that the 4 - nation talks collapse . Oh boy , now the US is involved ... Oh boy , now the US is involved an accident on Devil , a planetoids orbiting Oort had caused a major deviation in its orbital trajectory . Devil is a small cometary nucleus , which was used as a source of water during the planetary modifications . Today , the hollowed-out core of the nucleus is being used as a prison to house criminals who led anti-government organizations . The cause of the accident is under investigation but it appears that a malfunction in a solar power satellite caused its laser to fire , damaging Devil 's outer protective layer and releasing a plume of steam from the ice core which reduced Devil 's orbital velocity . Devil is at present in an orbit that intersects the surface of Oort and the Sirius government has dispatched rescue teams to prevent Devil from impacting on the planet 's surface . However , the mission is experiencing great difficulties placing in jeopardy the lives of the Devil prisoners , as well as those on ground . Damn , that 's some news ! It might be impossible to rescue the prisoners . Oh , what 's with you two ? Why the serious look ? Mr. Joe ... Phone call for you , sir . For me ? Phone call for you , sir . For me ? For me ? What ? ! Semiramis ? ! We 've received an official request from the Sirius Government . You 've heard the news by now . It 's the ice planetoids . W ... Wait a sec ! Why are you getting us involved ? ! We just finished working on the Benito Foundation case only yesterday ! Exactly ! We had to guard the chairman for 2 whole months ! We sacrificed our youth hanging around with a 70 year-old man ! Look at it this way : it was a mistake to vacation on SA-Ara . Joe , your team is the only one that can get to Sirius within 15 hours . That sucks ! What about the Sabine 's team ? ! Oh ... they went to work on a new case 3 hours ago . This is pointless . We can 't oppose the Crusher Council 's decision , Joe . What 're you talking about , you big oaf ? ! You don 't need a break ' cause you 're just a cyborg , but we 're helpless human beings here ! Hush , you little bed-wetter ! A rookie Crusher like you shouldn 't try to talk to me like that ! What did you say ? ! Stop it , you two ! Elfin is right . A little flattery won 't cut it with me ... We didn 't accept the job yet , you know . Sirius is certainly an autocracy with many problems . But their government has officially requested our assistance and the council has decided to honor their request . If we can 't modify Devil 's trajectory , the prisoners ' lives will be lost . Further , an impact event on Oort will be catastrophic . Got it , Barney . Hmm ? What do you mean ? That old folks are very persistent . Are they prepared or what ? They dispatched an escort all the way to SA-Ara . They don 't want us waltzing in unannounced . Old folks are so worried about such stuff ! Oh , shut up , you little punk ! Whitsunday ? ! Knock it off ! Yes , ma 'am . What I don 't understand about this job is why they want it done ... Those men inside Devil are nothing but a nuisance to Hellenist . Yet , they want us Crushers to rescue those who revolted against them . They 'd be better off if the prisoners perished along with Devil . Exactly . And that 's what makes me feel uneasy . Why don 't we ask ... the Sirius folks . Our client should be waiting for us in there . Here they are , sir ... These are the Crushers the council on Semiramis have sent us . I 'm Chief Secretary Hume . His Excellency Hellenist has ordered me to oversee this mission . I 'm Joe , a Crusher . Halos ... Ricky ... Elfin ... You 're young ... Joe . Age has nothing to do with our work . You 're right about that . But the fact is , youth often implies naivete . What we seek is the unequaled know - how and experience of the Crushers . The rescue mission is considered impossible by our own forces . We can 't assign it to a naive bunch of incompetents . Then you need not worry ! 'Cause we 're the special , Class-A Crushers ! We got lots of experience in many places ! Oh ? You 've got a milk-drinking baby as a member too ? A milk-drinking baby ? ! Why you ... ! Can I ask you a question ... Mister Secretary . You may call me Hume . What 's the question ? Why do you want to rescue the prisoners ? If you ignore the prisoners and blow up Devil there won 't be any damage to Oort and you rid yourself of an irritant . That 's a 2-for-1 deal . Nonsense ! The Government of Sirius is not evil , nor does it have any malicious intent . No government can satisfy the desires of all its citizens . Yet , what would happen to our nation ... if we were to eliminate everybody who revolts against the government out of dissatisfaction ? That 'll be the end of it all ! But , that 's exactly what you 're doing , isn 't it ? That 's what the opposition leafless . Those who don 't agree with the government criticize us for even the most trivial of mistakes . Yet , the fact that the government of Sirius is sparing no effort to ensure the success of this mission shows their accusations are all lies . Am I wrong ? Hellenist must be planning to exploit this situation by appealing to planetary public opinion . That way , he can look good at the summit . So what ? Whatever they 're after , it 's not our problem so long as we can execute the mission we were contracted to do . Boss , we 're out of particle grenades . We used ' em all up on Kabobs . I wonder if there are any on Oort ? No . We Crushers are the only ones who can get particle grenades . Only Semiramis has them . I don 't think we 've got time to go get them . T-300 seconds to warp . Whoa ! T-300 seconds to warp . T-10 seconds to warp . 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... Warp coordinate-sync complete . 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... What can I do for you , Your Excellency ? What 's Hume up to ? Things are going well , sir . They 'll be arriving on schedule . I see . I 'm looking forward to it the Crushers in action , that is . No use ! I can 't contact the men inside ! What about Group-Two ? Group-Two , unable to establish contact . The passages into Devil have re-frozen and are blocked . Group-Three attempted to clear them with explosives ... it didn 't work ! What now ? We 're trapped in here ! What about the others ? Some of them must have survived . Melt water has refrozen and blocked the passages . Something really abnormal happened to Devil , that 's for sure . What are we to do ? I wonder if the folks outside have any intention of rescuing us at all ? Who knows ? We 're only a nuisance to the Sirius government . Looks like the water level is rising . Crushers will be arriving soon . All rescue groups , halt operations . We 'll leave the rest to the Crushers . All groups are to withdraw . My Crusher friends ... welcome to Sirius ! Military press conference ... This is our beloved nation , Sirius . Once again , our government extends a warm welcome to you . I , for one , would prefer a party to formalities ! A party ? ! Of course ! But only after the operation is over . These Crushers are a shooting star upon which we must make a wish ! The citizens of Sirius are glued to their windscreens , cheering you on ! Happy to hear that . Your face isn 't showing it . Happy to hear that . This is the ice planetoids , Devil . It 'll be perfect for on-the-rocks . Even now , it is continuing its plunge towards the planet . If nothing is done , in approximately 40 hours Devil will pass inside the Roche limit , and be ripped apart by gravitational tides . 90 % of the fragments will be vaporized high in the atmosphere . But , some will reach the ground intact . When they strike the ground , Oort will suffer an unprecedented catastrophe . We have only 40 hours . Before time runs out , we need you to alter Devil 's trajectory and rescue the prisoners who are trapped inside . That is the most fervent wish of His Excellency , and of our citizens ! I 've just received this report ... Our forces have retreated . None of them remain in orbit around Oort . How is the interior of Devil arranged ? I 'd like to know what it 's like inside , and how many prisoners it contains . There are 82 prisoners currently serving time . We only have partial maps of the internal structure . The prisoners decide for themselves where to dig . Once we check out the situation , we 'll decide on our strategy . Should something happen , we 'll need your assistance so hold position at Point A-40 . Very well . We 'll be waiting for you to contact us . You have 39 hours and 423 seconds remaining . Bongo , clean up the data for me . Rogen It 's frozen to the core . Completely frozen ! That 's awful ! A prison made of ice ... that 's cold ! I still can 't figure it out ... if they 're serious or not . It doesn 't matter . We signed the contract . We need to concentrate on the mission . Gee , even Joe 's turning cold ! Damn , this ain 't nothing to laugh about ! This isn 't just a chunk of ice ... it 's orders of magnitude bigger ! Elfin , put the images of Devil 's surface onto the main screen sort them by scan codes . Sure ! I wonder what the rescue squads from Sirius have done ... It doesn 't matter now . What matters is what we 'll be doing . One method might be the one we used on Metro . And , what was that ? Do your homework ! Metro , in the Constellation Aquila . They didn 't have water there , so during the planetary mods they inserted an ice planetoids into orbit . Then they stuck a spaceship engine onto what was left over and boosted it out of the system . Then , Joe 's planning to ... I want to , but the problem is the propulsion system . When you 're talking about a large mass like Devil one or two engines won 't give it the required acceleration . Hmm ... The challenge is to assemble as many drive systems as possible and to determine the placement of the drives , in the time we have . Bongo ... simulate the thrust and vector possibilities for me . Leave it to me ! Bongo , that 's it ' . ! We 'll use this program to figure out the impulse start-time and duration . Calculate the propulsion requirements with microsecond accuracy . Good ! Full acceleration from there ! Bring it up to planetary escape velocity ! Complete success ! Great ! That 'll prevent Devil from impacting the planet . Elfin , get Hume . OK ! We 've decided on our strategy . We 're going to need your help . We need small ships . Combined , we can use them to boost Devil . Small ships ? How many do you want ? 10 ? 20 ? 104 " Rocket " - class ships . 1 ... 1 ... 104 ships ? ! Impossible ? N ... No ! Just that , I was shocked by the large number required . It 's alright . With the Rocket-class ships , we should be able to do it . Within 3 hours . We 'll try . And , you can rescue the prisoners too , correct ? That 's your job . It will be easy for you to do , once we alter Devil 's orbit . We 're responsible only for the work we contracted for . Very well . I 'll see to it that the ships are sent to you . Looks like they 're here . The Crushers have begun their work , folks ! Responding to the Sirius Government 's request the Crushers are about to show off their unparalleled techniques ! Planetary modification , protection , investigation and transportation the Crushers , the pros of all pros , have mastered them all ! We 'll see just how they 'll stop Devil from whacking into our planet ! The decisive moment , the test of their talents , has arrived ! Hume ! Hume ! We 've had an accident ! We need your assistance at once ! We need help ! We 've got to send all the small ships out to the safety zone ! If we don 't , we 'll all blow up ! Well , fine by me ... What ? ! You see , Joe ... all we needed was to be seen to have paid a hefty sum to the Crushers in an attempt to rescue the prisoners . Even though it concerned those who were opposed to him His Excellency Hellenist made their rescue the top priority . But , unfortunately , the attempts weren 't successful . Such a tragic event is just what we wanted . Damn you , Hume ... Don 't feel too bad . It 's all fate . " Young Crushers face difficult mission , die in the attempt . " That 's such a poignant scenario , don 't you think ? Well , it 's certainly got my attention ! In that case , here 's to the ultimate finale . Halos ! Ricky ! Elfin ! 40 $ . ! Such an unimaginable accident ! It seems that human error occurred during the operation ! We enlisted the help of the Crushers , and expected perfect safety ! It is hard to believe that they are involved in an accident ! What will be the fate of the prisoners inside ? ! What about them ? They 'll be destroyed along with Devil . Joe ! Where are you ? ! Joe ! Joe ! Answer ! Joe ! Joe ! Where are you ? ! Where ? ! Crushers ... return to this ship immediately ! Devil 's orbit has decayed due to this accident . The predicted time to breakup has been drastically reduced . The latest calculations show that Devil will be ripped apart in 92 minutes ! I repeat ... return to this ship immediately ! Hume ! Joe is missing ! We 'll dispatch the rescue squad . We need to change our plans . Time is running out ! Hurry back ! I wonder if Joe is alright ... ? Relax . Unless he 's dead , he 's OK . Huh ? ! What 's the meaning of ... this ? ! F ... Fellow citizens ! This is a gruesome accident ! We have a report that at least one Crusher has been killed . With 75 minutes remaining until Devil 's destruction we 're left with one question : can it be stopped ? ! Well ? Have you found him ? No , sir . There 's too much debris , and it is impossible to sort it all out . Nor are there any remains that fit his description . I suppose that means he died in the line of duty , just as we hoped . Good . Any evidence of foul play will be destroyed along with Devil . Make it appear as if you did a complete search , then return to base . Yes , sir ! 3600 seconds until tidal breakup . What now ? Either our enemy 's convinced themselves that I 'm dead or , to confirm it , they 're roaming around Devil 's surface . So it 's best if we don 't go outside for the time being . Bongo , use your sensors to monitor the area . Rogelio There 's an ice cavern 20 meters straight ahead . Thick walls of ice block every other direction . Alright . Let 's try going into that cavern . I 'll bet that it 's a passage that the prisoners dug out . Are you here to rescue us ? Tell us exactly what happened ! This planetoids will be destroyed in 3000 seconds . Escape is highly recommended . Is what he said for real ? ! I 'm a Crusher . I was hired to stop Devil from hitting the planet but I failed , as it was all a part of a plot . In an hour , Devil will break apart when it passes inside the Roche limit . " Break apart ? ! " Devil will be ... ? ! " Break apart ? ! " Well ? ls there any way to save us ? ! Aren 't you here to rescue us ? ! No ! I came here to hide , because Hume is after me . What ? Hume ? ! What ? That 's a name we haven 't heard in a while . He 's trying to wipe all of us out , along with Devil . No kidding ! Only he could think of something like that ! Damn ! We aren 't gonna be sitting ducks ! Guys ! Hop inside ! Stop it ! Garcon can only hold 4 people ! And even then , it 'll only become a coffin of steel once it 's out in space . Think ! We have to come up with another solution ! We 're already trapped inside a coffin of ice . Thinking won 't save us . Huh ? " A coffin of ice ... ? " " A coffin of ice , " eh ... Wait , Bongo ... beyond the surface lies space . Bongo ... bring the heat-cannon output all the way down to minimum ! Adjusting ! We 're building a coffin of ice ! And inside it , we 'll escape into space ! I get it now , Crusher ! That 's a great idea ! I can 't guarantee it will save our lives , but let 's give it our best shot ! Yeah ! Your Excellency ... there 's only 40 minutes left until the breakup . Seen from your position on the ground , it should coincide with the dawn . Very well done , Hume . Space and Air Defense forces have been positioned and they are prepared for the event . Spectacular ! Your Excellency , we have tried our best to save our enemies . Quite true . You ' . ! There is still a scene left for you to play . " Even after losing their team leader , in an attempt to save Oort ... " " ... from the plummeting fragments of the planetoids ... " " ... the Minerva and its crew perish ... " such a touching scene , indeed . The old " dutiful Crushers paying for their failure with their lives , " eh ? I guess that 's what it comes down to . Talk about a cliche plot twist ! You ruthless savage ! You ruthless savage ! You ruthless savage ! You 're so low ! Say what you want . Normally , I wouldn 't give Crushers a chance to die so heroically ! Take them away ... to the Minerva . Yes , sir ! Take them away ... to the Minerva . These are the 20 locations I want you to excavate . I 'm going to install a propulsion system here which I 'll salvage from a small ship up on the surface . We 'll get into an escape orbit using its thrust . We only need to use it once . I 'll go get it . Meanwhile , you guys get to work in here . Sure ! Bongo ! You can stop the heat-cannon now . We 'll go outside in Garcon . We need to find a propulsion system and airlock we can install in here . 10 minutes to Devil destruction . Space Force Squadron Unit-1 ... Launch ! What the ... ? ! Ye eek ! Huh ? ! Whoa ! Huh ? ! Whoa ! Huh ? ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Huh ... ? ! Get lost ! The Minerva is this way ! What do you think of the show , Your Excellency ? This pageant of annihilation ... I hope it 's to your liking . Splendid work , Hume . The dance of fire across the sky , as dawn breaks ... It truly is a celebration of victory . Thank you very much , Your Excellency . Haven 't you finished them yet ? ! Pardon me , sir . There are only 3 of them ! Eliminate them at once ! More guards ! This isn 't good ! Elfin , hurry up ! Duck ! Sorry ! We 're full ! 1st Combat Wing ... Launch ! Wipe them out at all costs ! Captain ... there 's an unidentified object on radar . It 's on an escape trajectory . The object is likely a fragment detached from Devil just prior to its destruction . Just prior to its destruction ... ? It seems impossible ... but , Captain , could it be ... ? Let 's check it out . Well ? Are you tracking anything ? It 's hard to say though I did pick up a few blips . There 's a lot of interference . Perhaps Hume is coming after us ... ? You do have the rescue beacon on , right ? It 's transmitting on the Crusher dedicated channel . Hume shouldn 't be able to detect it . Though , we just have to hope the right people find us first . But , just sitting here and waiting ... isn 't my style . 5 ships are after us . We can escape using the chaff bombs . Oh , wait ... Another 5 ships ! But they look like ... Like what ... ? These five aren 't after us ! They 're going after something else ! Halos , a rescue beacon ! It 's on the dedicated channel ! Say what ... ? ! It 's on the dedicated channel ! It 's being transmitted from the object that those five ships are headed towards ! It 's Joe ! It 's Joe ! He 's escaped from Devil ! We gotta do something ! Halos ! The enemy is gonna catch up with you ! Shut up , will ya ! Will he be OK ? Ha ! Beats me ! Will he be OK ? So , they 've come . Bulgar here ... the unidentified object is actually a gigantic ice fragment . Heat source detected in the interior ! Looks like the heat from bodies . It seems that they 've carved their way out of Devil . A Crusher on the surface ! Commencing attack run ! Awesome , Joe ! It 's like watching a circus ! Yo , Ricky , long time no see ! How are ya ? Very , very well ! Everybody 's alive-n-kicking ' ! I 'm alright too ! Elfin ! Watch the enemy ! You rat ! Don 't steal my kills ! Ricky , Elfin ... Hook up cables to the ice ! We 'll tow it back ! We 'll pay you back for everything ! Persistent assholes ! Who 's that ... ? ! T ... The United Space Force ! The United Space Force ? ! Message , sir ... " Cease fire immediately ... " " You are to follow our commands . " Say what ? ! Get real ! This is Sirius territory ! They 've got no right ! That 's not true , sir ! We 're out of our territory ! We 've been in open space for 100 seconds now ! Never mind that ! Do it ! Fire ! Fire ! You fools ! I didn 't know that we were helping out the Crushers . Had I known , I would 've helped the Sirius guys instead ! I don 't recall asking for any help . Sorry we got in your way ... Damn right ! What 's up with those two ? ! What was that ? Did you mumble something ? ! W ... No ! Er ... well , I was just wondering what 's gonna happen to the prisoners . They said that they 're going back to Sirius to continue opposing Hellenist until he 's defeated . After they just got rescued ? ! They can fight again because they were rescued . That 's the kind of fools they are . Hellenist will be in deep trouble this time , that 's for sure . And that 's who 'll open the way for a new hero to emerge .

He 's out there all alone , with nobody to ... to take care of him . Sorry kid , the rules are the rules ! No minors allowed , no exceptions ! Well then , can you tell me why he was arrested ? A poster of a warrant for his arrest . - For what ? - How should I know ? - Then who does know ? The clerk at the Court . Forrester , Paul ? Here we are . Bench Warrant signed by Judge Arthur Richardson . Superior Court . That 's the building next door , fourth floor . Follow up somebody at the Court House . Pepperoni Pineapple for Mister Paul Forrester . And finally , Your Honor , apart from those parole violations , the only incident on Mr White 's entire record was that little domestic squabble that got him into trouble in the first place . I don 't call biting off a woman 's ear a little domestic squabble . - Well , nevertheless ... - Nevertheless , my foot ! Look , Miss Hart , We all know one month from now , you 'll be moving to a fancy corner office . High up on a tall building , worrying with all those big bucks lawyers whether the Sun 's gonna fade in your new carpeting . Have pity on all us down her in the trenches . and spare us another another song and dance about innocence wronged . Now , the people have anything to say ? No , your Honor , faced with your eloquence , we 're dumbstruck . Now , don 't you start . Mr White 's bail is hereby revoked . He 's remanded to the State Adult Authority . to serve up the remainder of his sentence in full . There will be a five minute recess before hearing testimony in case in case number 13-6-5-4 . That 'll be a closed hearing , all rise ! - What 's the closed hearing ? - Steven Putnam case . Tell me after 10 years they finally caught Putnam . No , they just got the guy that took his photograph . ( Are we gonna get through here today ? ) Once there , it 's fair , I bought lunch yesterday . Excuse me , Ma 'am , you 're a lawyer , aren 't you ? Yeah , except on payday . You don 't get thrown in jail for double parking . That 's exactly what happened ! There must have been something else . Something about contempt of court but he didn 't do it ! There 's a procedure for signing public defenders , go back and see the clerk . You were kind of hard on that kid . He deserved it . He called me Ma 'am . That 's what the man said . Mr Washington , I suspect you have some contraband in your trunk . I said , hey , check it out ! Nothing there but a spare and a jack , Jack ! So then he said , nevertheless , driving an expensive vehicle like this suggests that you 're doing something wrong I said , that suggests I 'm doing something right , Jack ! You 're the one doing something wrong driving that old Rudy poot police car ! Rudy poot ? Which one of you is Forrester ? I am . Out of there ! I 'm doing something wrong . Hey ! Closed hearing ! But I 've got to see the clerk inside . Sorry , kid . For the record , this photo is credited to free-lance photographer Paul Forrester . The person is standing before this court after being apprehended on a bench warrant for failure to answer subpoena . Sir , are you Paul Forrester ? Yes . Alright . Mr Forrester , you 're not on trial here . Our purpose is to hear your testimony to assist us in the apprehension of Steven Putnam . Do you understand ? Yes . Yes , I do . Alright then . Where is Steven Putnam ? I don 't know . Alright , let 's try it another way . Where was this photo taken ? I don 't know . Yes , you do . You took it ! I did ? Your name 's on it : Paul Forrester ! Erm ... I don 't remember . Do you think a jail cell would help your memory ? No , I don 't think that would help at all . Mr Forrester , I don 't like your attitude . This is not a game ! If you think your media status makes you immune from the law that everyone must obey , you are sadly mistaken . No-one hast the constitutional right to obstruct justice ! Now , once again , where is Steven Putnam ? I don 't know where he is ! So be it ! The regional contempt citation stands . Mr Forrester is remanded to the custody of the Sheriff . And you will remain in jail until you cooperate with this court . How much time you spend behind bars is entirely up to you ! Now , take him away . Yes , Edna ? You think it 'd be OK if I left a little bit early today ? My grandson 's basketball team , they 're having the play-offs something or other tonight , - And I promised ... - Yes , yes , of course ... Thanks , I appreciate it . If you don 't mind my saying so , maybe you need something to take your mind off it . What 's that ? That alien of yours . Why does everyone refer to it as my alien ? Looks like I 'm Jimmy Stuart with that big rabbit of his . The alien is real , Edna , if he 's out there , it belongs to you , It doesn 't just belong to me ! In fact , it belongs to the whole world ! Yes , Sir , of course , I understand . I 'm sorry , Edna . Please , forgive me , of course you 're right . The truth is I don 't have anything else , I don 't have a wife to go home to , I don 't have a week-end barbecue , I don 't have a grandson to go watch play basketball , You will one day ? Will I ? I don 't really have a life of my own , do I , Forrester ? What the hell is the matter with me ? Am I crazy ? I 've give up everything for this one maddening search ? You know what I used to want ? I used to want , I used to want a house with a little white picket fence , I used to want a wife , a kid ... I wanted to play a little golf . You know that I 've never been to Ireland ? Mister Fox ... What ? Maybe you should consider just giving up ... letting it go ... What ? Forget about it . Edna , are you seriously suggesting that that a basketball game or that a white picket fence or a six-foot rabbit is more important than it ? More important than an alien ? Why don 't you take a lead of your senses ? Are you out of your mind ? Isn 't that the same kid ? Watch , he 's gonna come over and tell us how his Pop is innocent . Maybe he is ! Give me a break , in the past 12 months I have represented more than 200 defendants How many of them do you think were innocent ? There are no innocents , only degrees of guilt . Hi ! You don 't give up , do you ? Look , I don 't know what to do . My father needs your help . Whatever they said he did , I know he 's innocent . What a surprise . Look , isn 't it possible they got the wrong Paul Forrester ? Paul Forrester ? That 's what he said . You 're talking about the photographer Paul Forrester ? Yes . Come with me . Mister Fox ? Mister Fox ? Look ! Ten years ago , a convict somehow got a gun , and tried to escape from the State Pen . He killed a guard before he got killed himself . Steven Putnam was his lawyer , a public defender . And the authorities claimed that Putnam smuggled in the gun Pastrami on white bread ? With mayonnaise ? So , did Putnam give him the gun ? Well , he claims he didn 't . But he ran away . And he hadn 't been seen in ten years until your father took these photographs . Dad ! Paul . I 'm Charlotte Hart , with the public defendant 's office , I got myself assigned to your case . - Scott , I 'm sorry . - You didn 't do anything . How are you ? Are you ... ? Where are you staying ? I 'm fine , Dad , don 't worry about me . I 'll give you a minute before we discuss your defense . There 's your sandwich ! Oh , roast beef ? Roast beef , you don 't want . It 's pastrami , the pickle came with it . Great ! On white bread ? With mayonnaise ? I have to get out of here before Fox finds out . If he hasn 't already . Dad , why don 't you just use this and break out ? You think this Steven Putnam is guilty ? Sure . Why ? Why else would he run if he wasn 't guilty ? That 's why I can 't run . But Dad , you just got through saying yourself : " What about Fox ? " If I run , not only Fox but every policeman in the country will be looking for you , and me ! I have to get out of here legally . Then we 'll just have to explain to them that you 're not Paul Forrester ! Paul , I 'm sorry but we got a lot of ground to cover . - Scott , will you excuse us ? - Yeah . I have no secrets for my son . That 's OK , I 'll wait outside . You take care of yourself . You too . OK . Everybody 's entitled to the best possible defense . That 's in the Constitution . If you have no money , you get me . Take this morning , I represented an alien . And the poor guy just ... Did Scott say anything peculiar about me ? Like what ? Nothing . OK . The judge is tough . But he doesn 't want to put you in jail . He wants Putnam to stand trial . So , what are out options ? Number one : Freedom of the Press . You were probably thinking of the Bill of Rights when this whole thing started . How did you know that ? An educated guess . But in the Law , a photograph is not the same as the written word . A photographer is not the same as a writer or a reporter . Roast beef is not the same as pastrami . Exactly ! So , option number two : Well , the quickest way out would be to sing for the judge . Sing for the judge ? Yes , tell them what they wanna know . Charlotte. erm ... I wanna get out of jail , I have to take care of my son . I wanna be free . But I can 't tell the judge anything about Steven Putnam . Good for you . I can 't tell you how much it means to me , Paul , to be representing a real minch . What 's a minch ? A human being . Miss ? Mister Fox , the pilot cannot make it go faster so , please don 't ask me again . I was just gonna say , this is the tuna casserole , I ordered the Salisbury steak . That is the Salisbury steak . Oh ! Oh yes , thank you , miss , I see that . I promised your father you can stay with me til he gets out of jail . Erm ... thanks but ... I 'm not a kid , I can take care of myself . Oh . I understand . Well , let me know which hotel you 're gonna be staying at . I 'm gonna need your help . This is my last case as a public defender . What do you mean ? I 'm joining a big law firm . Shorter hours , more money ... Instead of defending the indigent , I 'll be defending the rich . I 'm looking forward to it . I think . So , remember to call me when you got a room . On the other hand , because we got a lot of work to go over , may I should just ... Good ! Settled . Man , I spent three years , Jack ... Three years fussing with that car ... Like I was a doctor bringing back the dead . I tell you the horn I played " Ode to Joy " ? Yes , you did . First time out digging . Heading for a classic car show . You run into some dumb village jag with a license to bust your chaff Yeah . I must have told you that too . ( Alright ! Lights out ! ) I tell you about the time , man ... I was running 150 women ? Yeah , man , the south east , I had the whole south east . As a matter of fact , no , no , I had every state in the Union , man . About 500 women altogether . You know , then I pushed my international connection , Europe , you know , France , Italy ... That 's about , I think 1000 altogether . You know , one time I even got a call from the Kremlin , man . George Fox , special agent , FSA . Frank O 'Hare , Sargent PD . You caught him , huh ? Who ? The Middle Park peeper . Well , that 's a nice collar , Fox . The folks in the Middle Park wanna be be able to sleep tonight if a degenerate like that is behind bars . This man is with me , he 's my assistant . Oh , any cover ? Well , in a manner of speaking . Actually , we 're here about Paul Forrester . Who ? Forrester , Paul Forrester . Is that with one R or two ? This Paul Forrester . Two R 's . You 're holding him on a 33-11-9 . We got a fed linked to your perp with a probable jurisdiction demanding . Now I understand . Why didn 't he say that ? My shift is over , my replacement will help you . That 's all right , O 'Hare , and many thanks for your help . What help ? Can I help you ? I 'm George Fox . Special Agent , FSA . Yeah ? Scott , why don 't you sleep in my bed tonight ? I 'll probably be up half the night working anyway so I might as well sleep on the couch . Yeah , OK . I appreciate this . Professional courtesy . Your man is in B-23 . Yeah , here he is . Where do I sign ? - For what ? - The prisoner . You don 't ! I 'm taking him ! I 'm taking him to Washington for interrogation . Not without proper authorization . What ? The rules are the rules , pal . You want Forrester ? You get yourself a Federal Court order , you take it to Judge Richardson 's . Federal Court ? I don 't have time for that ! - You ever heard of professional courtesy ? - Look , why don 't make arrangements for Forrester 's attorney - to interrogate him here ? - His attorney ? You got any idea at all of who or what you got down there ? - That thing isn 't even human ! - He seems like a nice enough guy to me . What kind of rules are these anyway ? It all started with a thing called the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . Maybe you 've heard of it . Huh ... Yes , you Honor , I know . Your Honor , this is a matter ... I dug up this old tape of your Dad , let 's take a look . LIVE , AND I 'M CHATTING WITH ... GONNA SURPRISE YOU WITH A PHOTOGRAPHER ... PERIPATETIC JOURNALIST , NOTORIOUS ROGUE AND NOW , AUTHOR , PAUL FORRESTER . HOLD IT , I SAY , DON 'T ACCUSE ME OF BEING AN AUTHOR . BUT YOU WROTE THIS BOOK . IT 'S ALL PICTURES !

THE LAST THING I NEED IN EARTH RIGHT NOW IS TO BE TIED DOWN BY A KID . THAT 'S JUST ... THAT 'S JUST NOT ME . What 's going on ? What are you talking about ? That man in jail who 's my client , who you say is your father , is not behaving like the man on this tape . Well , people act different on television . Come on , it 's my business to know when somebody 's lying . What 's going on ? Miss Hart ? Yes ? Miss Charlotte Hart ? Yeah ? I 'm George Fox , with the Federal Security Agency , may I come in ? Well , it 's a little late . It is about Paul Forrester . Come to the office tomorrow . Miss Hart , Forrester was travelling with a kid , do you know where he is ? He didn 't say anything about a kid . Well , miss Hart , can ... ? Miss Hart ? I 'm waiting ... For what ? I don 't know who he was ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Paul ! Come here ! Hey , hey ! What about me ? I wanna get out of here ! You ! In here ! How is it going ? It 's a zoo ! Come on ! Inside . I 'm Eddie Bennett from the legal clinic , I 'm gonna handle your case . - I have a different ... - I have another case ! OK ? Now , I got the DA 's Office to knock down the pandering charges to operating the concession stand without the street vendor 's permit . You 're gonna be out of here in ten minutes . - I don 't know ... - You 're not gonna get a better deal , believe me . - No , I do believe you ... ! - Look , how you earn your living is your business , mine is copping you a plea , which I did , so ... Could we move on this ? I 'm doing four courtrooms , all at the same time ... - What I 'm saying is ... - You don 't like it . What I 'm trying to say is I love it ! So tell me , Jack , what you knock my charge down to ? I took some pictures of a protest demonstration in Moscow , and ... I got arrested by the KGB . Scott ? Dad ? Why are you dressed like that ? It 's what they gave me ! You think it 's too flashy ? Dad , be serious ! How did you get out of jail ? It 's called " copping a plea " . What ? Means they made a mistake . Who 's that ? That 's you ! Well , it 's him . It 's him . Is that the way I look ? No , wait ! Wait a minute ! Let me ... let me do it . OH , THEY WANTED TO KNOW TO PLANNED THE DEMONSTRATION AND WHERE I GOT TIPS TO ... TAKE THE PICTURES AND ALL THAT , I ALMOST TOLD THEM ... THE NEXT DAY THEY LET ME OUT . PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT PUBLICITY IN THE WESTERN PRESS . AND THE DISSIDENTS ? THE RUSSIAN DISSIDENTS ? THEY 'RE STILL IN PRISON . I CAN SEE WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU 'D SAY THAT THIS WAS YOUR MOST FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE . AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ! HOW ? IT MADE ME APPRECIATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS . THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH . OF THE PRESS . OF ASSEMBLY AND DUE PROCESS . WHEN THAT PLANE LANDED AT JFK , I 'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY THIS , I GOT OUT AND KISSED THE RUNWAY . WHOA ! OK , SO , I KISSED THE STEWARDESS BUT THE SENTIMENT WAS THERE . Here 's your Court order . Read it and weep . He 's not here ! [ THAT AIN 'T YOUR CELL , WOOD , I KNOW YOUR CELL NUMBER ] Did Charlotte have that magazine ? The one with the picture ? You mean this one ? Good . Good . Let me have your sphere . What are you going to do ? Figure out where this picture was taken . You 're kidding ? How ? By the position of the stars . Only , there is not enough arc in this picture , the way it exists . So ? So ... watch . Why didn 't think of this before , I mean , instead of staying in jail ? I never said I was a genius . Wow ! Awesome ! Orion ! You should see the real thing . Yeah , anytime ! There , we 've got it . We do ? Yeah . Now all we need is a local map of ... Oh , my God ! What are you doing ? It 's just a light trick . My Dad is an amateur magician . Don 't lie ! Who are you ? Don 't be afraid . Innocent or guilty , I 'm still entitled to the best defense , all right ? It 's in the Constitution . He really is my father . He won 't hurt anybody . Please . I don 't believe this . Then you really didn 't take that picture . No . Where is the real Paul Forrester ? Here . Among the stars . Did you kill him ? No . He didn 't . So ... You were telling the truth about Putnam , you don 't know where he is . I didn 't know . What ? I didn 't know but now I do . I know where this picture was taken . Will you help me ? [ APPRECIATE IT , THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ] No , wait a minute ! We don 't have a warrant ! Look , friend , it was your people that let him walk out right under your noses , Don 't you start with me about warrants ! - What are you doing ? - How do we know he 's in there ? Yeah . [ OK , SO , I KISSED THE STEWARDESS BUT THE SENTIMENT WAS THERE ] I 'LL TELL YOU , IT 'S GREAT TO BE A FREE MAN IN A FREE COUNTRY , WHERE YOU DON 'T HAVE THE KGB BUSTING DOWN YOUR DOOR WITHOUT DUE PROCESS . Amen ! Turn off ? No , not just yet . I don 't believe I 'm sitting here . Did you have anything to do with getting yourself out of jail ? NO . I didn 't think so . When I went into the room where your file said you were supposed to be ... You met Tyrone . I met Tyrone . He thought the whole thing was very funny . Well , actually , so did I. That was kind of flashy head , though . I thought so too . How much farther ? Nor far . What 's wrong ? Are we lost after all ? I know where we are . And I know that the picture was take somewhere near here . But I can 't take you there . I don 't think Paul Forrester would . What do you think we 're doing out here ? Look , you wanna get out of trouble , right ? Putnam takes the heat and you walk . That 's the way the system works . I don 't think that 's what the Founding Parents had in mind . Who ? You know , the people in the school books ? We the people ? Look , you 're making this much too complicated , if you don 't tell the Court where he is , the police is gonna be after you from now on , that 's the deal . The deal was made by Forrester and Putnam a long time ago . He was promised protection . Yeah , by Paul Forrester . And by the system . Look , I 'm the system too , OK ? If I know where he is , I have to tell the authorities . That 's why I can 't show you . You see ? It 's not complicated at all . Look , I 'm not gonna stand here and argue the law with somebody from some place with a different system . I 've been doing this for all my life . You just have to believe that I know what I 'm talking about . Does that mean that you are going to defend Putnam ? Oh no , let some bright eye rookie take care of that . No , for the first time in my career , I want a career to think about . Sounds like somebody who doesn 't believe very much in the system . No , no , that 's not what I 'm saying , I never said it was perfect . But it is the only one we 've got . And OK , it 's not the greatest thing in the world but it 's better than whatever 's in second place . Why don 't you tell that to him ? That 's crazy , I ... Besides , what would I say to him that would change his mind after all these years ? You 'll think of something . Are you Steven Putnam ? Who the hell are you ? I 'm your best possible defense . Here it is . I hope nobody followed you . No , don 't worry , I was careful . Well , I guess this is good-bye . I know you 'll get Steven Putnam off . I believe him . And in him . And in the system . And in the system . We 'd better get going . Yeah , I know . Oh , don 't forget this . Take care of yourselves . Whatever you do , don 't double park . No , I learnt my lesson . When you give Tyrone his stuff back , tell him thanks for the use of his car . I will . Did I tell you that the horn plays " Ode to Joy " ? Oh , Charlotte said , the system is a hell of a lot better than whatever is in second place . What is in second place ? Countries that don 't have the Bill of Rights , I guess . I 'm glad we live in this country . Oh , great ! - What 's she doing ? - We 're getting a ticket . A ticket to what ? It 's not to something , it 's for something . Why are you doing that ? Twenty minute limit here , Sir . I didn 't know that . Ignorance of the law is no excuse . Is that in the Constitution ? Dad , just pay the two dollars . That 's an expression , it 'll be more like ten . Look , you wanna make a federal case out of this ? You don 't wanna pay the ticket ? Go to Court ! Tell your story to the judge .

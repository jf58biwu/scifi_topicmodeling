 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . REPORTER : In the wake of the escalating violence ... in the West Los Angeles district known as Little Salvador ... the Governor , today , ordered Army Reserve units into the area ... to aid police and fire officials , in hopes of quelling ... what one city official has dubbed a " revolution of nonsense " ... since no clear motive for the near-riot conditions has yet surfaced . As a 24-hour curfew remains in effect , police enforcement officials ... feel confident the violence is contained ... ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) Matthew , we 're wanted in Grazer 's office . Did you get the jackets and reloads ? Yes , they 're in the car . Then as soon as I get my breakfast , we 're back out there . What about Grazer ? What about him ? We can 't ignore his orders . Matt , that is not how that machine works . Wanna bet ? Sit here and shut up . Where are all the booking forms ? Been a busy couple of days . Get me some ? Hey , man , I 'm just passing through . Damn it , Sikes . I 'm coming off of a triple shift . I 'd be home right about now if this cowboy hadn 't tried to mug somebody ... in front of the station . Should have thought of that before you busted him . I 've directed the black-and-whites to do their bookings through Rampart . It shouldn 't be too bad up here . Yes , sir . George , let 's move . You 're not going anywhere . We 're to hold down the fort . That 's his job . Come on . Hold it . Because of the ongoing trouble ... ie , Los Angeles burning , I feel I can best serve this city ... by attending the Chief 's crisis control meeting . Okay , so find somebody else who wants to sit behind a desk . We 're hitting the streets . There is no one else . What are you talking about ? The place is crawling with pencil ... End of discussion . Now if you 'll excuse me , the Chief has scheduled a briefing in less than an hour . And he 's expecting you ? There 's a riot going on , Sikes . I 'm not sitting around here waiting for an invitation . I 'm going down there to confer with my colleagues ... on tactical procedures . Wait a minute . Tactical procedures ? You 're not pulling out that thesis again . This thesis graduated me from college with honors . It 's a bunch of numbers and charts . It has nothing to do with what 's going on in the streets . Napoleon 's Russian defeat has nothing to do with what 's going on ? I beg your pardon , Mr. History Means Nothing ... but the lessons the French Army taught us in deployment of troops and supplies ... can be very useful to a modern police force under riot conditions . Of course , there are obvious parallels . Don 't kiss up to him . He can kiss up to me anytime he likes . I wasn 't kissing up anyone . Yeah , you were kissing up to him . And I 'm not sitting in this stink hole ... while he showboats for the brass . Wanna bet ? Perhaps if you apply the baking soda I provided ... the stink hole wouldn 't stink so badly . Don 't start again with that sensitive nose routine . It is not a routine . The collective odors of the collective bodies of humans under these conditions ... has inflamed my nasal cavity . How 'd you like another cavity inflamed ? Look , Bri , how about if I pulled two triple shifts ... and stop talking about you behind your back ? Here 's the duty roster update . Mitchell and Foster will be in to relieve you tomorrow at 0800 . Swell . What do you think you 're doing ? That 's city property . I catch you doing that again , you 'll be cleaning toilets . I already clean the toilets . I got him printed and I threw his personals on my desk . Yes , fine . What do you mean , " Yes , fine " ? Sikes , get a life . He 's got a phone call coming . Don 't forget . I have a very keen memory . You remember we clean our own fish around here ? You 're my partner , George , not his . Partner . Yes , I 'm your partner , not your trained seal . We are stuck here , so what difference does it make if I process this man ... so Dobbs can go home and take a well-deserved bath . However , if you two continue to hover around me oozing that body odor ... I may very well lose whatever self-control I have left ... and throw you both through an open window . I 'm out of here . Grazer says I have a bad attitude . COP : One Adam 56 , put us 10-8 out of the station at 9 : 56 . ANDY : Man , this gig better be worth it . TOM : I 'm telling you , with this riot going on , there 's got to be millions in that locker . Anything you want . Anything . How long does he do this for ? Until the candy falls out . I brought you some leftover bladder and some lobes . I 'm not hungry . Did you bring the air freshener ? Will you eat ? You look exhausted . Is there any reason why it took you two hours to get here today ? I 'm sorry . Buck took his time bringing the car home ... and traffic was terrible . Buck was out joyriding in the car while I 'm breathing vaporized garbage ? It 's time you had a talk with him . George , I think I 'm just going to get your clothes out of your locker ... and get out of your way . Detective Francisco . Yes . I will take ... Fill out a report and I will send an officer ... when he is available . Ma 'am , I 'm sorry . Perhaps an hour . Could you please hold one moment ? I 'm sorry . It 'll be over soon . WOMAN : ( OVER PHONE ) I got to talk to somebody . Hello ? Somebody ? Yes ma 'am . Thank you for holding . Could you describe the young man ? Yes , Detective Sikes is here . Who 's that ? A Miss Letitia Rosario . She asked for you personally . She said that ... Tisha Rosario , how the hell are you ? Yeah ? What kind of lewd behavior ? I wouldn 't worry about it . He 's probably just a little frustrated . Detective Francisco . Is the gunman still there ? Then I 'm afraid all I can do is just write down the information . No , I can 't say you ever frustrated me . May I have your name , please ? Hold on a sec . Sikes . It 's for you . I 'm going to grab another phone . Hang on . Could you hold on one minute ? Yes , thank you . This is Detective Francisco . Georgie ... did you get my man booked yet ? No , but I am working on it . Don 't take too long 'cause you know I 'll catch all the flack . We wouldn 't want that to happen . Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah . Is everything all right ? Yeah . The kids aren 't home . I beg your pardon . Nothing , man . Jurisprudence , George . ( PHONE RINGING ) MAN 1 : Is this the police ? GEORGE : Yeah . I can 't hold them off much longer . Oh , yeah ! GEORGE : Detective Francisco . MAN 2 : Is this the cops ? Listen , I live at the Palm Canyon Apartment ... ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) Anything happen yet ? Chief 's coming down at 11 : 00 . A fire battalion got peppered with small caliber gunshots over on Wheaton . Looks like the revolution is breaking out at the seams . How do I get on the agenda ? Start with the guy wearing the bow tie . He 's taking orders for lunch . Perfect . Look , lady , I don 't care what race , color , creed or religion you are . We don 't have an officer available to get your cat out of the tree . I 'd get a big saw . You 're welcome . What ? I 'm very good at answering the telephones and taking messages . Go for it . Hello . Police Department . Albert the janitor speaking . Hello . Tisha . He said that with a knife ? Okay , stay put . Right . 4856 Newton . 311 . Be right over . Where are you going ? Some guy wants to hack up an old girlfriend of mine . I 'll dispatch a black-and-white . There aren 't any . It 's just down the block , I 'll handle it . Matthew , I can 't handle this alone . Albert 's a gold mine . I 'll be cleaning the toilets . DIANE : Yeah ? TOM : Okay , I got one phone call . The place isn 't gonna get any emptier . Let 's do it . Yeah , the transformer 's just round the corner . What 's happening ? What 's the ... ( GUNSHOT ) Sir , I don 't think you understand . Because of the trouble on the West Side our response time is ... Hello ? Albert . What happened ? I 'm sure it 's just a brief power failure . ( GUNSHOTS ) Why don 't you stay here . Sounded like it came from dispatch . Get to the weapons locker . I 'll work on emergency backup . All right . Since I called you we 've lost one detective . Dispatch and the desk are clean . Good . Backup generator 's right on schedule . There 's probably two or three more in the building . They don 't leave . We got 20 minutes . Let 's use them well . Any problem ? It doesn 't smell clean yet . ( SUSAN EXCLAIMS IN FRIGHT ) Albert , what is it ? Human . Stay here . ( WHISPERING ) Albert . Stay there . Let me check the loading dock . See you , pal . So , how you been , Sikes ? You know me . Donuts and beer . And meter maids ? No desire after you left . Sikes , I 'm in law school now . They teach you to pick up on the bull . Letitia , I 'd love to sit under your window all night but there 's a riot going on . We had a couple of riots in here , didn 't we ? Look , Tish , why don 't I take a description of this guy ... You didn 't see him when he left last night . He was wired . When he called this morning , he wasn 't fooling around . He 's coming back . Okay , we 'll give it a few more minutes . Thanks . You look good . What are you doing going out with a guy who 's gonna chop you up ? We met in my ethics class . He was after me since day one . It was a mercy date . To get him off my back . It 's amazing who they take in law school these days . ( RATTLING ) Letitia , I 'm back . And you 're under arrest . Come on , man , don 't make this hard . I 'm gonna cut you , man . Put the knife away and I won 't break your face . Get off me , you pig ! Man , I 'm going to sue you for police brutality . And I 'm charging you for a new shirt . And a trip to the emergency room . If this stuff is as pure as it looks , we got $ 10 million sitting right here . There 's plenty of time for that when we 're out of here . Holy Mother Theresa ! Half this stuff isn 't even cataloged . These guns are untraceable gold mines . TOM : Hey , man , look over here . There 's a suitcase full of cash . ANDY : All right . KEN : All right , that 's enough . Day watch is due in 10 minutes . I want to be gone in seven . Are we clean ? Maybe not the top floor . Then get up there . Everything has got to be clean . You know the drill . Check every room . Barricade every exit . Are you listening ? Nobody 's getting in or out . The main corridor 's clean . What the hell 's that ? We stick to the drill . Understood ? All right , let 's move it . MATT : Oh , man , Letitia , slow down . Wait . I got to do something . I 'm fine . I 'll just check myself into the ... Sikes , you 're cut really bad . I 'll keep trying 911 . Just wrap it . Where 's my shirt ? I 'm soaking it . It 's kind of red . Letitia , I got to call the office . I already did . The line 's busy . George must be going nuts . Drink your juice , catch your breath . I 'll get hold of your partner . ANDY : Look at all this , man . We have hit the jackpot here . TOM : Yeah , Kenny really set up a gold mine . How we doing on time ? We 're okay . Just keep moving . It 's a good thing we have two hearts . Just lie still . What 's going on ? What happened ? Somebody 's trying to take over the station . That explosion was probably the evidence locker . Albert , I 've got to get you to a doctor . No . I 'll be fine . You have to find Susan . Susan ? She 's still here ? I tried to protect her . I 'm sorry . Lie still . Leave me . I 'm too easy to find . ( SPEAKS TENCTONESE ) Marshal Kutuzov beat Napoleon by not defending Moscow ... against popular opinion . We can disperse this riot by not worrying about the Art Center ... and countering in key parts of the city . The Mayor 's screaming to defend the Art Center at all costs . Politics have to be thrown out in a crisis situation . If the Mayor keeps sticking his nose in this police action ... the entire city will be lost . Kutuzov bucked public opinion and won . It 's all here . You mind ? Be my guest . I think you 'll find a very focused , clear presentation ... with very little room for argument . I don 't know what we 're all sitting around waiting for . I should be on the podium . We 're wasting time . Excuse me . This isn 't right . I ordered the lobster salad . Does someone have my lobster salad ? Get this last load . I 'll find her . I got through to the paramedics . They 're on their way . These cold towels are enough . You 're feeling better because you 're sitting down and I got that arm wrapped . You got a five-inch gash in your arm , Sikes . Did you get through to my partner ? I 'm trying . You guys pay your phone bill this month ? No more mercy dates , okay ? Keep me busy and you got a deal . Tell them to put down their weapons or I will exchange gunfire . Is that clear ? It won 't do any good . If anything has happened to my wife ... I 'll see you burn in whatever you Terts burn best . Put your hands in the air . Now , I want you to turn around very slowly . Now take your weapons and put them on the ground . GEORGE : All right . I want you to lock your hands behind your head and get on your knees . Why don 't you do the same ? Stay there ! How long do you think this is going to last ? The shift will be over in a few minutes . Let her go . Don 't be stupid . Get in the van ! Stay , or he 's dead ! All right . Let me go . She 'll let go of your wife . That 's the only deal you 're going to get . Let her go . She 's a lot more valuable than he is . ( SUSAN SCREAMS ) No ! Get in the van ! ALBERT : George . It 's a good thing you had a vest on . They went west , George . I saw them . Did they have Susan ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Andarko ! I 'll never get an open circuit . You can 't go alone . Albert , you 're hurt . I will be all right . I want to help . Stay here . Inform the watch what happened . All right , George . Albert , if something should happen , be with the children . I will , George . 4856 Newton . Matthew 's at 4856 Newton . REPORTER : As the Latino community continues to erupt in scattered violence ... over what now appears to be a gang-related incident ... emergency crews from Orange and San Bernadino Counties ... have been moving in for relief . TOM : He was the one with the plan . What did you have to kill him for ? His plan changed . Watch the road . You killed him ! Shut up , you stupid Tert ! You shut up ! TOM : I don 't even know where I 'm going . Ken knew how to fence this stuff . You blew it . You stupid Slag bitch . Just drive . You try that again and I will break your jaw ! What do you need me for ? It never hurts to have a little protection . Get us the hell out of here ! What do you think I 'm trying to do ? MAN : Come on , get out of here ! This is Detective Francisco . I need an open tech through dispatch on a code 13 . Yes , it is a primary emergency . ( PEOPLE ARGUING ) GEORGE : Keep trying , dispatch . I 'll continue to follow . Matty ? I 'm okay . Really . I just got to ... What are you doing here ? What happened ? The station ... George ... I can 't ... It 's okay , Albert . Just take it easy . You 'll be fine . George is the only one left . What are you talking about ? So much has happened . He needs you . MATT : ( OVER RADIO ) George , can you hear me ? Where the hell are you ? I 've just followed them into an abandoned factory . Wait a minute . Hold on . Leave him alone and let him fix it . You dumbass , we only need one thing , that can . We need it all . No , we don 't ! TOM : Lady , just take off and let me do what I need to do . Axle 's bent . Forget the van . Forget it ? It 's what it 's all about ! It 's why you killed Kenny ! No , it 's not . Yes , it 's an abandoned factory . 300 block of Vasca Way . Matthew , I don 't understand . When can they give us support ? I don 't know . This whole riot thing is completely out of control . Ten city blocks are a disaster area . I had to raise my voice a tad to get Albert admitted to the hospital . I can 't just sit here . I know . It 's out already ! Come on , get out of the way ! What ? Nothing . I 'm a little hung up here . There are three of them . Two human males and one Newcomer female . Matthew , they have Susan . Yeah , I know . They 've also got a lot of firepower and a low respect for police officers . George , don 't be a hero . I 'll get us help . Just forget the van . We don 't need it . I can get it fixed . I 've got the parts , I 've got the tools , I can do it . Just give me a half-hour . Don 't you understand the van is not important anymore ? The can is all that we need . Everything is in there . We can 't just leave it . We have got maybe 15 minutes before they get here . I am not sticking around . She took off . Who the hell cares ? You 're dumber than I thought . Look here , let 's just get everything we can carry ... and get the hell out of here , man . No ! We can 't leave it . Everything 's in there . Don 't you understand me ? Everything . Everything I need is right here . Adios . Napoleon rushed to Moscow ... just like the National Guard rushed into Miami with the Cuban thing . And into Detroit in ' 92 . Like they 're doing now , right here . It 's all one big tactical mistake . You make it look so obvious . It is obvious if you read your history books . I tell you , after today , my thesis will be textbook material ... for the entire law enforcement agency . You know , if this works in the streets , you 'll make Commander before you 're 40 . 40 ? I thought you 'd be in between the sheets by now . Albert gave me a call from the hospital . Dispatch gave me the location . Where 's the party ? I 'm not sure . I got one down by the van . No sign of anybody else or my partner . They got his wife ? Yeah . My guess is that George is out there trying to find her . Gotta bring him back . Let 's give them hell . I 'll get my gear . I think this valve would help . How did you know ? How could any of us forget the smell on the ship ? It seems like we breathed it for a lifetime . There 's nothing holy about it . They controlled us with this . It reduced us to robots . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) With this I can control an alien nation . I can control the whole damn planet . It 's an army that 'll do what I say when I tell them . It 's like being ... ( SPEAKS TENCTONESE ) Yeah . An Overseer . Freeze your ass ! Police ! Don 't shoot . You got me . Don 't fire . On the ground ! Up . Scum , where 're your dance partners ? I don 't know ! Really , I don 't know ! ( WHISPERING ) Susan ? Susan , over here . Are you all right ? Yes . You wanna go in or you wanna wait for backup ? Susan . No ! It 's me ! Dobbs , we 're the backup . Very good . My voice only , Susan . Kill him . Don 't shoot . It 's Susan ! George , get the hell back here or we 're not going to have many options . What 's going on ? I smelled leeah mikken . That stuff they used on the ship ? Susan is being controlled by leeah mikken . What are we talking about ? She 's pumped with that gas the overseers used to control their cargo . Kind of like why they chained my great-grandfather on the slave ship . She 'll do whatever she 's told ? Obey the command of one voice . And that voice doesn 't seem to want us around . So when does the stuff wear off ? From what we know a small amount produces a chain reaction . It could be hours or days depending on the concentration ... ( ANDY LAUGHS ) ANDY : Baby . Follow me . MCKNIGHT : There 's one concept I 'm not quite sure about . On page 52 ... this chart shows the Russian general 's reinforcements . Marshal Kutuzov , yes . How does that compare to the rioters ? That 's the wild-card factor . Look at Appendix D. The wild-card factor can be reinforcements , food , ammunition . I 'm not sure how that would work in an inter-city situation ... but you sure have done some work , here . It 'll work . Look at Appendix 4F , McKnight . Even a third grader can understand that summary . This is something . All here . Oh , my God . Why didn 't I get this earlier ? What are you doing ? A little problem at my division . Wait a minute , you got to deliver this report . My division 's in trouble , McKnight . What would you do ? First , I 'd consider the city . Then I 'd give that report to somebody with a mind like yours . Somebody who could get it out . Get it working . Oh , no . I couldn 't . Come on , we 've been talking about it all morning . You 'll do fine . If they have any questions ... you know who to have them call . REPORTER : ( ON TV ) ... caught on fire . We have to move . Agreed . What do we do if she shoots ? What ? What would you do if you were staring at the gun she was pointing at you ? So we got one option . We get to the voice that 's controlling Susan ... before Susan gets to us . ( GUNSHOT ) What the hell was that ? Let 's do it . The big one . He 's up on that furnace . I 'll draw him out . You circle around . No , I 'll draw him out . Matthew , your arm . I would stand a better chance . You have a better chance of staying alive circling . George , your kids 'd feel a whole lot better if one of you walked away from this . Be careful . Yeah , that 's me . Mr. Careful . ANDY : Come on people , let 's party . Come and get me ! Here I am ! ( GUNSHOT ) MATT : I 'm right here , pal . ANDY : Keep coming , I 'm right here . What are you waiting for ? Sounds like you 're having a hell of a party up there . I 'm feeling fine , baby . Let 's do it ! Come on , let 's do it ! MATT : Okay , we 're here . Take it easy . Come on down . Nothing 's gonna bring me down . Let 's get on with it . Freeze ! Police ! GRAZER : ( OVER BULLHORN ) I 'm very willing to talk and negotiate . Let the lady go . What is he doing ? Looks like he 's exchanging himself for your wife . He doesn 't understand . She 'll use Susan against him . Go . Check his car . Get in the squad car now , Susan . Is it empty ? No . There 's a policeman . Get him out . Get him out or you 're dead right here . Jenkens , get out of the car ! Drop your gun . You 're dismissed . In the front seat , Susan . Move ! Get in . That 's it . What 's it ? We have to stop that car . Matt , give me your gun . Drive . And I can guarantee you the bullet 'll have no trouble getting through the seat . George . GEORGE : Just to stop the car . I sure hope he knows what he 's doing . You picked a hell of a time to say that . Come on , George . Do it . She all right ? I have to get her away from the gas . You all right , sir ? Great . Real neat . You think it 's the gas ? Bri , babe , put your foot in your mouth . This has a lot of potential . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) MATT : Keep working on it , Bri . George ? She 'll be all right . Matt , thank you . GRAZER : Hey ! Why don 't we all go get tattoos ? MATT : Dobbs , get away from me . Sikes , buddy , friend , it 's ring night . They 're passing out championship rings to the Clippers . The tickets are impossible to get . I 'm not switching shifts with you . You 're a real pal , Sikes . Yeah , that 's me . I 'll be happy to take the tickets for you . I 'd eat them first . I want to find out what division McKnight is with . I wanna know why everyone thinks my plan was his plan . Why no one 's called me . And who put him in charge . Sikes ! What ? I 'm here . You don 't have to yell . I got to yell . You and George handled the arrest of a Harry Dundee ? Never heard of him . Your memory is eggplant . Where 's your partner ? Checking Albert out of the hospital . We didn 't handle a Harry whatever . Then quit throwing bogus reports on my desk . I 'm sorry somebody stole the credit for your thesis ... and ended the riot , but it 's like you said ... even a fourth grader could have come up with it . You may be right . But I should be the fourth grader getting that credit . And , sooner or later somebody 's going to explain to me how I got this tattoo . Hello , Letitia . Yeah , hi . You remember that guy Harry ? Yeah , right . Do me a favor . Lean out your fire escape window . He is ? Okay . Yeah , I 'm gonna come over in a little bit . What 's that ? I love bubbles .

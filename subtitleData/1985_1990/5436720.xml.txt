 S SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS Stardust Boys ! However you look at us , we ain 't no Superman We can 't even be stars of the space opera We can 't even save anyone at a critical moment , and won 't show up as you expect . We 're not chic enough for you to have a sigh , Our work is poor , so , no applause deserved . We don 't even appear in children 's dreams , And we are not missed by grown-ups either . But still , We are not totally and utterly useless . Stardust Boys still have some hope ! You know , we , Stardust Boys ... have some virtues after all ... Stardust Boys ! Translation by Utopus Sync by Marian What are you reading ? ! I am ... you know ... as a captain , about the fundamental facts , and science , I 'm studying day and night ... Right .. Serious ! [ beeping ] Ah , transmission from Earth . This is Spaceship Sagittarius . ... Hi , Pito ! .. Yes , I just got out of the hospital .. .. I 'm fine .. .. of course , the baby , too . Anyway , how is your study going ? I 've had many thoughts ... but , how about " Love " .. ? You see , since it 's a girl .. I want her to be filled with love very much . " Love " ? That 's not so bad . Well , what about " Pretty " ? As they say : " Its name will represent itself . " Surely , she will grow up as a pretty girl as the name goes .. What do you reckon , Pito , good name , isn 't it ? What about you , Pito , did you think of any names ? " How to name a baby based on the pronunciation and strokes of a name " .. What kinda study is this .. ? He hehe .. Well , for Toppy , this must be a more serious topic than the fundamental facts of the universe I think " Pretty " sounds more friendly than " Beauty " .. " Lovely " is good , too . You know what they say : " Don 't judge a book by its cover . " " Polite " means modest in manners ... . Lovely , Polite , ... .. MYSTERIOUS ALIEN ! ? SIBIP APPEARS We 're finally arriving at Planet Vega III . Where is Prof. Anne 's ship ? ! Looking for it now . According to our calculation , we should catch up with her ship around here .. ! This got to be it ! Compact spaceship ! It 's going along the orbit ! Looks like it 's getting ready to land .. Alrighty , let 's chase it down to the atmosphere ! alright ! Go ! Oh my .. ! What is this heat .. ! ? Mr. Giraffe , you wanted to cut the budget cost at minimum and requesting this job to a small firm like ours , you 've got to expect things like this cheap ship to have some cheap issues .. But , don 't you even have a proper cooling system .. ? ! ! Found it .. ! Huh .. where .. ? .. Oh , look there ! [ beeping ] Uh .. uh .. This is Sagittarius , Space Service Agency , Sagittarius . Prof. Anne , do you copy ? Prof. Anne , please respond .. This is Anne ... What can I do for you .. ? Uh .. we are .. Ah .. Professor Anne ! It 's me , Giraffe ! Eh .. ? ! Giraffe ? I came here to bring you back , having spent all my savings , and I even had to sell all my clothes and left with nothing but my underwear .. ! Giraffe ! Oh , no . She 's going faster ! Ah ! Professor ! Professor ! Let 's go back to Earth . This place has yet many unknown factors and it 's too dangerous for a woman ! Giraffe .. .. But I cannot back away ! I believe your theory ! The mysterious people who has created the Continent of Mu was aliens originating from this planet , Vega III .. ! .. It must be so , I believe . .. So , you don 't have to risk your life to prove such .. ! It might be absurd , for sure ... but , for me ... Mu-ans were aliens ? Nonsense ! She 's mixing up the archaeological facts with her fantasy dreams .. Without any supporting evidence .. ! After all , she 's merely a woman .. ! I know how you feel ... but .. Giraffe .. If you know how I feel ... then let me go ... Will you , please ... What a horrible driving .. ! Something wrong with the engine ! Is it because we 've slightly hit that edge of the hill ? Who knows ? ! .. This ship is a second-hand one , so ... Dear ... I don 't think we can continue chasing her anymore .. Oh ... oh no ! Alright .. We 're making a great sacrifice for you ! Professor Anne ! Can you hear me ? ! It 's Giraffe ! Giraffe ... Once , I was told by my father .. " You don 't need to earn a scholarship because you 're a female . " ... You know , I thought , everyone was treated equally in the realms of academics .. but I ... . Professor Anne ... I must prove my new theory about the Continent of Mu is correct ! Otherwise , I ... I will never be independent ! Independent ? That means a person who is able to stand on her own feet and go on in life ... Independent ? ... Independent .. ... to make it short , " Indy " ... Indy ! What the .. ? He 's losing speed .. ... Toppy ! .. Toppy ! ... .. Indy .. This is the name that 's worthwhile and represents the future ! Independent woman ... That 's Indy .. ! Toppy ! Argh .. ! Toppy ! Professor Anne ! Professor Anne .. ! Toppy .. ! Well , looks like we 're gonna be able to continue flying for a while and also found out where Professor Anne has landed . Yeah , we 're so fortunate ! Little Indy .. Such good name .. .. You are so fortunate .. Well , thanks .. What the heck ! You idiot ! Professor .. ! Professor Anne ! Well , let 's do the job . Professor Anne ! .. Where 's Professor Anne .. ? Looks like she had some minor mistakes when landing .. She should be okay . From here , she must 've abondoned the ship and taken off on foot . Already took off ... Of course , did you think she was gonna wait for us to come .. ? Say what .. ? ! Our ship will probably take 4-5 days to be repaired . What we 're gonna do ? Why don 't you think about baby 's name ? You can kill time for sure ... Yeah ! Why not ! You know , I 'm not the creature who only thinks about eating .. ! Creature ! ? It 's not like I want to do such , it 's because of that spoiled shrew ! Say that again ! + % * + * % + * + * # # % * What the heck is this ? ! # # * + # * + * # # $ # ' # $ # Quick ! Make it go away ! Don 't you have the automatic translator ? ! Oh , you 're right ! Good thing I brought it ! ... Let 's not fight ... ! What ? ... Let 's not fight ... ! What a roundabout way Let 's not fight ... ! Who are you .. ? [ alien translation ] [ alien talking ] .. My name is Sibip , a space minstrel . That 's the harbor of this region .. Looks like Professor 's gonna get on that ship from here .. As soon as she landed , she asked Sibip where the harbor was . When is the ship due to depart ? When is the ship due to depart ? [ alien translation ] [ alien talking ] Tomorrow at dawn .. That means ... Professor 's gonna spend the night around this region .. Perhaps , she 's somewhere in that village .. ? Can 't say that for sure .. In this region , there are over 100 villages , of all sizes ... Alright ! Let 's search for accomodations around here one by one ! Let 's go to the village anyway . [ alien talking ] He 's asking us if he could be hired as our guide .. ? Unfortunately , we don 't have much money .. Unfortunately , we don 't have much money .. [ alien translation ] [ alien talking ] Says , " I don 't want money , I just want you guys to take me with you . " Doesn 't want money .. ? Something is fishy .. We don 't need a guide . We don 't need a guide . [ alien translation ] Thank you for all , bye . Thank you for all , bye . [ alien translation ] Pepo . Not even one person is out . It 's already evening , must be inside their houses .. Well then , let 's go ... ! Anyone here .. ? ! Wow ! Here they are .. This many .. ! Where the heck were they hiding ? That 's what you would expect of Vega III ... I 've never seen this kind of species .. Seems they 've never seen Earthlings either .. You give me this ? Weird taste ... But , they are greeting us , it seems .. [ grins ] [ clapping ] I think they liked it . I think they 're friendly ones . Looks like we gonna be able to relax tonight . [ alien talking ] " Welcome to this village . " .. I think he 's the chief of this village . [ alien talking ] What he says ? He says , " Please shake hands with me . " Shaking hands ? That 's no problem at all . Well then , shake hands .. [ crowd stupefied ] Wh .. wha ... What the heck is going on ? I don 't know .. [ alien talking ] [ alien talking ] [ alien talking ] Wh .. What ? What is he saying ? ! They 're gonna execute us ! Exe .. .. cute ! What the heck ? ! What the heck is going on ? If we knew that , we wouldn 't had this hard-ship . .. That translator ... Looks like it 's the same as your spaceship .. used ! What ? ... Certainly , it sometimes does weird translations , but It can still be used . Cheap ones have some cheap issues ... . Huh ? Whaat ? ! You wanna fight again ? Be that as it may ! See ? Please take a look at this .. I 've been making some observations for a while now and it seems like it is prohibited to touch other man 's body in this village .. You can see when they walk , they try to avoid getting too close to each other . Indeed . So they must not have such custom as hand shaking to begin with ! Instead , it must be that they clap at each other to exchange greeting . So , when they were clapping ... That 's right . It was not that we were welcomed , but just that they were merely greeting us .. .. You get it now , what the chief of this village wanted to say ? But .. this damn automatic translator .. .. misinterpreted " clap " as " shake hands " ! Damn second-hand ! So , we 're now in this desperate situation because of this machine 's mistakes .. ? ! We 've done the rudest thing to the most important person in the village , you know ... ? But why do they have to execute us for that ? ! Oh , what a delicious lasagna it is .. Professor .. Oh . Aah .. ! The the ... the ship ... the ship is departing ... ! What ! ? Oh uh , it departs now ... Professor .. ! Professor .. ! Professor Anne .. ! AAAAAANNE ! ANNE ! ANNE ! Noooo ! I 'm going , let me out ! Nooo ! Let me outta here .. ! No way I would die without meeting Prof. Anne ! Don 't say that ! It 'll only make it harder on us .. Only gonna suffer more .. No use , I guess ... [ alien talking ] [ alien talking ] Lasagna .. ! Professor Anne ... ! ... Pito ! ... and ... haven 't decided her name yet ... [ alien talking ] It 's Sibip .. ! [ alien talking ] What ? What 's going on ? [ clapping ] [ alien talking ] Although a mysterious chap , it looks like we have to hire you . Pepo ! By the way , what was the song you 've sung about ? [ alien talking ] Oh my gosh ! I broke the translator ! We 'll understand each other in time . Right ? Pepo ? Pepo ! You saved our lives .. Now I get to meet once again with Pito and my baby .. .. can meet alive .. ... alive ... . ! We 've lost Prof. Anne , huh ... The boat comes only once a day . Let 's chase her with tomorrow 's boat at dawn . Well , it looks like we 'll have to sleep in the open tonight . Better than the stiff bed in the spaceship .. Uh ? What did Toppy go back to the spaceship for ? He said he had to make one last transmission to Earth .. .. " Lovely " , so what ? ! .. " Indy " , so what ? ! I 've forgotten what is more important ! Whatever you do , it 's possible only if alive ... To live ! It 's " Live " ! " Your name is " Live " , he says . But he said the reason is secret .. " Live " means to be alive , to have life , and so on ... . It looks like your Dad has had many things to think about ... How is it , " Live " ? You like it ? Well , this is it !

 [ tires screeching ] [ music continues ] [ tires screeching ] [ music continues ] Superb-o-o-y ! [ evil laughter ] It 's no life form we 're ever encountered . [ alien grunting ] ( alien ) Give up , Superboy . [ sucking air ] [ blowing air ] Stay cool , man . [ alarm ringing ] Freeze ! [ gunshots ] [ whooshing ] ( Clark ) It 's a sniper . Everybody get down ! [ groans ] ( alien ) Why can 't I get inside you ! Let me in ! [ alien growling ] I don 't want to delay getting him to my office to check him . Superboy can take care of himself . Why don 't you let me take care of you ? [ theme music ] ( male # 1 ) Amazing ! I mean there were enough explosives in that van to topple a building . But you seem to check out just fine . I mean , from what I can tell . I mean , even x-rays can 't penetrate your skin . I feel fine , professor , really . There 's nothing to worry about . You may be feeling no ill-effects now but you did black out . - Yes , for a second or two . - More like a minute . The point is , you 're not completely impervious to physical trauma . Now , take this laser . It 's powered by green space rocks that emit a radiation harmless to us , but deadly to you . Now , why ? I mean , what is the link .. ... between you and an unknown green element ? And this morning , you survived the immense heat of a major explosion , unscathed . Now , what if it had been the heat of a ... of a 15 megaton hydrogen bomb ? And then there is cold . Could you withstand temperatures approaching absolute-zero ? Beats me , professor . I 'm sorry . Well , these are areas we need to explore . So , I thought we might go down to the lab . I 'm sorry , professor . I 'm gonna have to take a rain check . [ whoosh ] ( Lana ) There 's still no answer . I can 't imagine where he is . ( Dean ) Can I help you ? Oh , Mrs. Lockhardt , this is Mr. Kent , Clark 's father . Mrs. Lockhardt , Clark has told me a lot about you . Your son is one of our most promising students , Mr. Kent . With the proper training and guidance he 'll have a very bright future ahead of him in journalism . I don 't give a damn what kind of training he gets . His ma and I , we 've been trying to talk that bum into working the farm . Well , building character is a big part of what these four years are supposed to be all about . I hope , one day , your expectations of your son will match ours . Now , if you 'll excuse me . Clark ! Clark , where have you been ? Where have you been ? I 've been looking for you guys all day . Your dad has been worried sick about you . - Lana , come on . - I 'm telling you . He hasn 't been himself . ( Clark ) Hey , Pa . Son . Oh , Clark , I 'll expect that write-up on Superboy and the sniper by tomorrow . Okay . Superboy ought to turn in his cape . What do you mean , Pa ? He survived the explosion , the policemen didn 't . But the policemen were shooting at him . He blew himself up when he blew up the van . - Everyone saw that . - That doesn 't matter . Though it seems to me that Superboy is supposed to preserve human life at all cost . Isn 't that the way you always heard it was , Clark ? Anything you say , Pa . [ intense music ] Well , then .. ... write the damn thing up any way you want , son . I mean , these days , people only believe half of what they read anyway . [ ominous music ] ( Lana ) Are you feeling alright , Mr. Kent ? I 've got a headache that seems to be encroaching on me slowly . Let me take you back to the dorm . That 's not necessary . Lana got me here , she can take me back . If that 's what you want , it 's fine . It 's really no problem . It 's on my way . Thanks . And , uh , I 'll see you later . Clark ? I hear you talk to Superboy now and then . Yeah , I do . What 's up ? Police business . If you see him tell him to get in touch with me , okay ? Okay . Nice office you got here . [ theme music ] Lieutenant Harris , I wanted to talk to you about this morning . Me too . I was just looking for you . Look , Sergeant Johnson , the SWAT officer who tore up the agriculture show .. ... any reason why he tried to blow you to bits ? - I haven 't got a clue . - That makes two of us . I can 't get any of this , tied up . I knew Johnson . He was straight as an arrow , not a head case . I must be missing something . Something must have happened last night when Johnson and his partner came across a break-in at the cryogenics lab . Cryogenics lab ? There was a break-in ? - Yeah . - Do you know what was taken ? Some vials , box of hypos , different things . [ intense music ] ( Lieutenant Harris ) What is it ? What 's wrong ? I hope it 's not what I think . [ theme music ] [ ominous music ] It 's gone ! You can turn right up here . That 's just a service road . Just goes into the woods . I 've got a surprise for Clark .. ... and you . What ? What is it ? I was just thinking how terrible it would be if something awful happened to you . Break my boy up something fierce , don 't you think ? Don 't talk like that . Nothing 's gonna happen to me . Uh-huh ? Mr. Kent ! Mr. Kent , stop ! [ thrilling music ] [ groans ] [ Lana screaming ] ( Lana ) No ! No ! Stop it ! [ music continues ] What do you want ? ( as alien ) Revenge ! [ dramatic music ] A major section of downtown from Fourth to Central has been sealed off . Now , what caused the unidentified man to start this rampage is unclear . The police are preparing to move up to the roof .. What 's going on ? ( male reporter ) ... where the gunman is still holding his hostage . No demands have been made , but it is interesting that- - [ gunfire ] [ siren wailing ] [ gunfire continues ] It 's in Pa . ( male reporter ) The SWAT team has taken up strategic positions on surrounding buildings , as well as the roof- - Okay , guys , clear out . Clark , I .. You were on your way to cover the story , go ahead . No , no way . I 'm not gonna leave you . I 'm okay . I just ... I , like , need to be alone . I 'm alright . Thanks . [ intense music ] [ sighs ] Professor Peterson . This is Superboy . I need your help . [ siren wailing ] Take it easy , pal . No one 's gonna hurt you . Just tell us what you want . I don 't want anything from you . What I want will be here soon enough . This structure 's been secured and evacuated . No one 's getting in here unless I personally authorize it . No , no . There 's no way to stop the one I 'm waiting for . Who 's this guy talking about ? ( Superboy ) Lieutenant Harris . Please , let me handle this . - Superboy ! - Careful , Lana . ( alien ) You be careful , Superboy . I know your powers . But you can 't use your heat vision here . It 'll trigger off the detonator . He 's rigged himself with enough C4 to blow this roof off . You 'll be the only one here to get out alive . It won 't happen . Look , I know who you are . I know what you want . Do you know that I wanna kill these two ? And I want you watching ? That 'll be my revenge . My sweet revenge , indeed . When I leave this mortal shell .. ... I 'm gonna play you body after body forever . Goodbye , Superboy . Wait ! What you want more than revenge is me . I 'll trade you my body for theirs . I tried to get into your body , I couldn 't . I can let you in . You could ? Yeah ! Your nobility is so silly . I accept . Release her . - Don 't do it . - Now . Not here . My senses tell me , the body you 're in , is weak . His heart is palpitating , his blood pressure is high . Yes . The human body is so frail . He needs medical attention . A doctor I know will see that he gets it . No tricks , Superboy . Or he dies . I will let you in . I give you my word . I know you 'll keep your promise . This fool man ... take such a pride in virtues , ideals . [ intense music ] Go ! Go ! [ theme music ] Professor , could you check this man out ? He 's not in good shape . - Of course , come in . - No . First , we exchange bodies . It 's far too complicated to explain , professor . Let 's get this over with . [ whooshing ] [ whooshing ] [ intense music ] [ alien grunting ] ( as alien ) Yes ! He 's even more powerful than I ever imagined . [ alien grunting ] ( as Superboy ) Professor , I 've got him in me . Do it now . Do it ! [ machine beeping ] [ laser humming ] [ alien grunting ] [ intense music ] ( as alien ) The laser thing ... turn it off ! Turn it off , will you ! ( as Superboy ) No , I will not let you . You 're not gonna kill again . [ alien howling ] Son ? ( as alien ) Turn it off ! It 's killing me . ( as alien ) Let me out ! Let me out ! You tricked me . You broke your word . ( as Superboy ) I promised to let you in , you 're in . I too made a promise . [ thrilling music ] Clark , what- - [ music continues ] You 're not my son . What did you do with my son ? [ groaning ] [ music continues ] Give me back my son . - Pa . - Son . Son . My god ! What 's going on with you , son ? - I 'm dying . - Dying ? [ mellow music ] Alien , it 's inside me . No , it 's impossible for you to die . You 're too important to me , to ma , to everybody . [ laser humming ] It 's the ray .. ... that 's what 's killing you . And I 'll shut it off . Freezer room . Freezer ? Oh , okay . Okay , okay . Shut the door . You want out ? Get out . [ alien grunting ] Retreat ! Wait ... wait to freeze solid . [ alien grunting ] [ victorious music ] Okay . What do you think , Doc ? Poisoning from the space rock radiation seems to be subsiding . We did it . I guess I can handle those cold temperatures after all huh , professor ? Clark told me about my odd behavior . Oh , everyone knows it wasn 't you . Hm . There 's a lapse in my memory and that 's what 's disturbing . Lana , when I was alone with you did I .. Did I do anything that wasn 't proper ? Mr. Kent , you could never do anything that wasn 't decent or upfront . Pa . We better start . - Thanks , Lana . - Thank you . See you soon . - And you keep an eye on my boy . - I will . Bye . T.J. , nice meeting you . Yeah , we gotta stop having these long conversations , huh ? [ laughing ] - Have a safe trip , back . - Thanks . Hey . You know , when all the action 's going down and ... we 're in the middle of it wondering where Clark is . This time I know exactly where he was . Safe and sound in his dorm room worrying about his father . I wonder if he had a chance to thank Superboy . You have to go so soon ? I don 't think my heart could take it any longer . Boy , it 's been one hell of a trip I 'll tell you . I never expected when I first got here that I 'd be accused of being a terrorist . Good thing it didn 't take Superboy long to straighten things out with Lieutenant Harris . And to do the same for Sergeant Johnson . He 's a nice fellow , that Harris . So is Professor Peterson . I didn 't take to him , at first .. ... but after a while , he kinda grew on me . Hey , I 'm glad you were around when I needed you . I 'm not used to others doing the rescuing . Yeah . Well , that 's what parents are for , son . [ engine cranking ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

 Edison Carter calling Network 23 . Network 23 , are you receiving me ? [ Man ] This is Network 23 . Not receiving . Intermittent loss . Edison Carter to Network 23 . Come on , guys . Clear this link . Network 23 to Edison Carter . The link is strong and clear . Two minutes to air time . Your controller is Gorrister . [ Edison ] Thank you , 23 . Gorrister here , Edison . Stand by . Gorrister , what 's Carter 's ETA ? I can have him on the ground on 30 seconds . All right . Good . All right . Bring up that satellite view . Edison , we 're going to lead with you . [ Edison ] Copy that , 23 . On the air . 15 seconds . Stand by to roll tape . 5 , 4- - [ Announcer ] The award-winning Edison Carter in the ... - 3 , 2 ... - What I Want To Know world . This is Edison Carter answering the questions other people are afraid to ask . What I want to know is this- - who died today in apartment complex 142 zeta , and who is trying to suppress the story ? Come with me now , live and direct- [ Man ] Run eyewitness . - ... on Network 23 . We don 't know what happened . And now the Metropolice are everywhere . There was this awful noise , and then a woman came out running . They 're taking her off . I think they 'll have to scrape him off . Will you give me that wrench ? [ Edison ] Control , I 'm getting out of the chopper now . Okay . [ Gorrister ] I want you go to North 300 . There 's security on the main door , so I 'm going to bring you in on the east side . Okay , I want you to go right . Now turn left down that alleyway . [ Young man ] Hey , look at that vidicam . This door coming up on your left is a service entrance , probably locked . I have indications of two security guards . Go straight to the intersection . Turn left . The apartment 's the third door on the right . [ Guard ] Hey , where did this reporter come from ? [ Woman ] Isn 't that Edison Carter ? [ Edison ] What 's the woman 's name ? McWilliams , Gladys . It 's the dead guy 's wife . Mrs. McWilliams , my name is Edison Carter . Network 23 ? - Oh , yes . - We 're on the air , ma 'am . Could you tell me what happened to your husband yesterday , please ? Oh , it was horrible . Stu was watching the game on TV , and the commercial came on , and so I went to get his bisonburger , and- - It 's fantastic . They stunned her . [ Edison ] On whose authority are you sedating this woman ? [ phone rings ] [ Edison ] 200 million people want to know where you 're taking her . What is it ? Not now . For God 's sakes , we 're on the air . But , uh , Carter 's on the scene . The story is going out live . It 's incredible material . Have you looked at our ratings ? The numbers are up 3 points in the first five minutes . Yes . That is perfectly clear . - [ Man ] Look out for the big scroll . [ Woman ] It 's coming up on- - All right , Ted ... cut up your story on 5 . Continuity , cover me with a stand-by intro on my mark ... now . [ Man on TV ] This is Colin Maxwell at- - Gorrister , your story 's been pulled . Get Carter out of there now . Now ! Control , what 's going on ? Story 's been pulled . Pulled . Roll me in backup tape . I 'm not dropping this . The story 's been pulled . The word just came down to Murray . I 'm bringing you back . Gorrister . Gorrister ! - Here . Report this ! - Uhhn ! [ Man ] Hey , look ! It 's a vidicam ! Hey ! I take that ! Gorrister ! Come on , Gorrister ! Make it a chopper rush ! [ Man ] Control , this is chopper 7 . Looks like Edison needs help . [ shouting ] [ Man ] Come on , you idiot . Don 't let it go on . [ Man # 2 ] Oh , get a load of this . Hey , hey ! [ Edison ] Gun it , Martinez ! Gun it ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Get me back to Control ! - [ Woman ] Hey ! - [ Murray ] Edison ! What the hell 's the problem ? I damn near got killed is the problem . They pulled the story . I pulled you in . You cut me off ! No job is over until the reporter 's back at base , you little idiot . Always pulling that prima donna crap ! Get him away from me , Murray ! It 's my neck out there ! I just want a controller I can trust . The best . Listen , Edison , I was out there once . I know how you feel . I want the best . [ Woman ] We have not regained contact with Edison Carter , so now , direct from Alaska ... This is big , isn 't it ? I don 't know . Isn 't it ? It was pulled from high up . Mm-hmm . Very high . [ Man ] Yes . Yes , yes , yes . Yes . Well done . Well ... I 'm able to report that Edison Carter was pulled off the air . The incident has not gone public . Are we certain the incident was connected - with the blipvertisements ? - Not yet . But I 've asked Bryce to meet us on the video link . Now leave him absolutely to me . He 's our top man . [ Woman ] Head of Research and Development on link , Mr. Grossberg . Ah . Bryce . I trust we 're not intruding . I 'm rather busy , actually . I 've just succeeded in computer generating a parrot onto the screen . My congratulations . Whatever next ? It squawks . I see . Bryce , I understand you have some information regarding your blipvert project , which might help explain the unfortunate , um , accident in apartment 142 zeta . I have a classified rebus tape which recorded the incident during a routine two-way sampler at the time . It is a bit graphic , I 'm afraid . [ sports announcer on TV ] [ voices speeded up ] Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! [ explosion ] My God . Bryce , is there any way to explain this ... side effect ? Oh , yes . It is rare but explicable . See ? The human body has millions of nerve endings . Each carries an electrical charge- - individually very tiny , but in combination surprisingly large . Now , normal people just burn this off in exercise , but in inactive people it sort of builds up . Now , because I designed blipvertisements to compress a 30-second advertisement into 3 seconds , it seems that the brain violently stimulates all these nerve endings simultaneously . In some viewers , this seems to cause to cause a short circuit throughout the body , and some particularly slothful perpetual viewers literally explode . Pretty simple , really . Simple . It won 't be so simple if news of this leaks out . My God . Come on , Ben . The only people that inactive are pensioners , the sick , or the unemployed . I mean , who really cares ? Bryce , is there any way to resolve this side effect ? Well , that really isn 't my problem . See , my brief was to find a way to compress ads to stop channel switching . I mean , I only invent the bomb . I don 't drop it . [ laughing ] Yes . Well , unfortunately , Edison Carter nearly stumbled onto the incident . And if people knew about this- - Well , then don 't tell them . Well , thank you , Bryce . These blipverts can be big trouble . We cannot abandon blipverts . The conventional ads give viewers time to switch channels . We are the only channel with blipverts . We lose them , and we lose the Zik-Zak Corporation to our competitors . And I do not intend to lose our major client . Edwards , ratings analysis , please . Overnight low at 115 million , high at 236 million . Projections are excellent . We 're still top network . I intend to keep it that way . [ Man ] Something wrong with Channel 5 . ou wanted the best . I got you the best . I know , but I just don 't want to meet her now . Shut up . Edison Carter , Theora Jones . Hi . Uh , she just said hi . Hi . You 've heard of her , so behave yourself . I managed to pry her away from World 1 . Oh , yeah . You think you can handle him ? I don 't know . Well , watch him . He 's , uh , he 's a charmer . How 's your head ? Fine . How 's yours ? Right . Where would you like me to start ? No trouble , or I stop your pocket money . - You know the rules . - Yes , we do . What do you say we start by breaking one ? See what you can get on this rash of reporters being pulled off hot stories for no reason . Edison . See if you can kind of , uh , access the inaccessible . Edison , come here . Now leave it . Back off . I mean it . What is so special about some microwave oven going pop ? Oh , come on , Murray . Since when do Metrocops carry microwaves ? - Edison . - Unless they 're cooking their lunch . [ Theora ] How about this ? Uh , that 's the executive level . You won 't get in there . This is about as inaccessible as I can get . All right , Theora , what you got on the line apart from the dirty pictures ? Okay , let 's see . Well , there 's a missile missing from AKG . That 's hot . Do you fancy that ? Uh , no . Assassination of the whole medic team in Bolivia . Nuclear submarine explodes . What about that one ? Hmm . Well , it is possible the situation is way out of control . Wait a second . Got to do something about that kid . Bryce isn 't the problem , Ben . We 've got to keep the blipverts on the air . Keep them on the air ? How can you say that after Bryce 's rebus tape ? I 've got no choice . We 're committed . The Zik-Zak Corporation 's advertising contract with us is positively massive . [ Ben ] Massive or no , if this gets out , Network 23 is in very serious trouble . Carter got too damn close to the truth this morning . Theora , run that again , that last bit . Carter got too damn close to the truth this morning . Did I now ? [ phone rings ] [ answering machine switches on ] [ Woman 's voice ] Thank you for calling Network 23 . This is Daytime Control . For Night Control , reselect 1987 . Or you can leave a message . We 'll get back to you in the morning . Have a nice night . [ keyboarding ] Hold your position . Stand by . Copy Control . No , there 's security on this level . Keep going . What do you suppose a rebus tape is ? A rebus is a kind of puzzle . Mysterious pictures . Secret . Got anything on that name yet ? No Bryce listed as staff . No payroll record . They must have him hidden somewhere . I 'll check Medical . Here we go . Bryce Lynch . Research and Development , level 13 . Uh , Theora , I hate to tell you this , but there 's no level 13 in this building . Oh , yes , there is . Got it . I 'm here . Open it . All clear . Proceed . There don 't seem to be any security guards at all on this floor . I 'm at the video lock , but I need the code . I know . I can see you . Okay , give me a tight close-up of the key pad . On my infrared now . The keys that get pressed are fractionally warmer . Let 's see . Okay , Bryce Lynch , 7th of October . Hmm . Libra . Might have guessed . God , he 's just a kid . Okay , try B-Zed-2-U-H . - Uh-uh . - Right . Two different codes- - one in , one out . Try I-J-2-F-I . [ door buzzes ] [ squawking ] [ squawk ] I think I 've got a prank caller on the line . he says there 's been a break-in on level 13 . What ? Who 's the caller ? He said his name was Lynch- - Bryce Lynch . Go to code red . Now . How about the playback unit ? How 'd you know ? Was there ever a kid who put things away ? Even a clever one ? I know all about little boys . Yeah , I just bet you do . [ grumble ] Camera check , please . Fine . You can start the playback . Edison ? Edison , for God 's sake , your camera 's gone down . [ sports announcer on TV ] [ voices speeded up ] Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! - Zik-Zak ! - [ explosion ] God . Control , did you get all that ? Control ? Control ? Control , where the hell are you ? Edison , thank God . I 'm pulling you out of there . [ alarm blares ] Edison , turn around . Both elevators are full of security guards . - Here he is ! - Let 's get him ! [ guards shouting ] [ Female guard ] Outsider ! [ Male guard ] Keep moving ! Okay , turn right and stop now . [ Guard ] Down , down ! He took the stairs ! Look ! I don 't want to be picky , but we 're going the wrong way ! Edison , there 's someone else in the system . Edison , grab something . I 'm going to hit the emergency brake . Whoa ! Darn . Edison , get out of there . I can 't hold the brakes . [ chuckling ] Edison , I don 't know what to do . Is there an express elevator on this floor ? There 's an elevator that can 't go anywhere but the basement . Okay , I want you to go right . He 's gotten away from me . He 's on his way to the basement . No ! Let 's go ! He 's down there ! He 's there ! Come on ! [ guards shouting ] Uhh ! [ screaming ] Heh heh heh heh . [ Ben ] But why ? [ Bryce ] He saw the rebus tape . Carter 's the best known reporter we have . He satellites globally in prime time . He saw the tape , Ben . And I 'm pulling blipverts now . You 'll do nothing of the sort . For God 's sake , you want this network destroyed after all we 've gone through to build it ? Blipverts have to be pulled , at least until we know how much danger we 're in . And get that man some medical attention . Just how much did Carter uncover , Bryce ? Why not just ask him when he wakes up ? Bryce , your naiveté is almost endearing , but the point is that I need to know before he wakes up . Well , perhaps we could read his mind . - Bryce ! - No . I mean it . I can make a memory dump of his synaptic circuits . Synaptic circuits ? Yeah . His mind , you know ? No . I don 't know . The brain is only a binary computer , a series of on / off switches . That the basis of my computer-generated people program . I can record Edison Carter 's memory into the computer , then regenerate him on screen , - just like the parrot . - [ squawking ] - The parrot ? - Exactly . Then we can ask his computer-regenerated image what he knows . Before he wakes up . All right . But what about his controller Gorrister ? He knows what 's on the tape , too . Unlikely . I jammed the transmission . Of course , I can 't be certain . Well , I 'll just have to make certain . Oh , I do so hate wasting employees . [ Theora ] Casualty supervisor , please . [ Female voice ] Casualty supervisor . Yes , I 'm tracing a Mr. E. Carter . That 's Edison Carter . Ident number ? Personal ident code 74928B DG6629 . Incident ? Auto accident . Section 5 , area 23 . No , we don 't have anyone answering that description . Have you tried the body banks ? Yeah , but body banks are for dead people . Yes , of course . Can 't you get on with this ? I 'm making really quite a bit of progress . Look , his childhood is here , his sexual memory there- - which is really quite interesting . This is a quantum leap over my parrot . Billions of bytes were required rather than millions . [ stammering ] Um- - Um- - Ma- - Ma- - Ma-ma- - Ma-ma-ma-ma-m- - [ Bryce ] It 's talking to me , Mr. Grossberg Max . I think it 's calling me Mama . [ stammering ] What is that ? Ma- - Um-um-um . Ma-ma-ma . Ma-ma . Computer-generated Edison Carter . For the moment there 's only enough memory buffer to generate his head . Too many coordinates for the rest of his body . Um-um-um-um- - But you 're looking at the future , Mr. Grossberg . Ma-ma-ma-Max . People translated as data . M- - Max-x-x-x . What 's it saying ? His circuits are randomizing a little bit . I need more time on the recall generator . It 's bouncing . It takes a while for the frames stored to read out all the information . - Max . - Well , damn it , Bryce , how long is this going to take ? I 've got a difficult decision to make , and we 're running out of time . Unfortunately , his most recent memory 's rather scrambled , probably from the blow to the head . It could take quite a while to sort through it . We don 't have quite a while . I 'm afraid our star reporter 's just going to have to disappear ... permanently . [ Men chattering ] I 'm listening . Yes , sir . We can do that right away . There will be the usual expenses , of course . Discretion is our trademark , sir . [ laughing ] Another nice accident , then ? It 's just a carry-out . It 's on the way . Max . Max . Max Headroom . - Max Headroom ? - Max . - Max . - Max . Max Headroom . All right . Now what happened ? I don 't know . He keeps shifting his memory location . He ? This was live and- - live and direct- - di-di-di-dir- - What I have here ? What I want to know is identify station . Enter da-da-da-data now . Excellent . Let 's enter Network 23 . This is- - is live and direct- - N-N-Network 23 . Am I on air ? I 'll be damned . I beg your pardon ? Was that thing talking to me ? Now he 's talking to you . Well , say something back . Uh , hi , Max . Hi , b-both of you . Welcome to Network 23 . Want to check these ratings ? I seem to have an audience of two . [ both laughing ] This is fantastic . Hello-Hello-Hello . And welcome to N-N-Network 23 . Live and direct , it 's Network 23 . The network where t-t-two 's company and three 's an audience . - Ha ha ! - Wait a minute . Where does all this stuff come from , Bryce ? The components of Carter 's mind . But he 's adding to it . He 's learning , Mr. Grossberg . Ha ha ! Is he still alive ? He 's a bit alive . Hey , nasty bump on the head , though . Easy , Luddite . Hands are rare and expensive items , worth more than cameras . [ laughing ] Metropolice just called me . Gorrister 's missing . There was a break-in in his apartment last night . They suggested we check the body banks . [ Female voice on P.A. ] This zone is reserved for complete bodies . Please unload and move on . Parked vehicles will be cited . Small organs to Zone Blue . Please have your deposit forms ready . Gather up what you can . We 'll talk price when I see the bits . Goodbye . Two for tonight , huh ? All right , let 's have a look . Seems familiar . Was he on TV ? People pay extra for celebrity parts . Definitely . [ both ] On TV . Yeah . Uh-huh . For what 's the bonus for a live dead body ? Clinical brain death only carries 20 points . This one 's still warm . And famous . There 's got to be a value in that . There is . 20 points . Do you realize how much we have at stake at this particular point ? [ Woman ] Ben , you 're not listening to me . [ arguing ] Enough ! [ silence ] Chaos is not helpful . Please , be seated . Edwards , what exactly did the Zik-Zak Corporation say ? Their whole campaign is designed to use blipverts to prevent channel switching . Ordinary ads allow channel switching . Their view is that they could buy time on any network for that . No blipverts , no deal . We can 't reinstate blipverts . They 're lethal . You know that . That hasn 't been proven . If the rebus tape isn 't proof , what the hell do you need , a live demonstration ? Ben , I find that tasteless . Nevertheless , blipverts are killing people . - Some . - Maybe . Look , I 've heard enough of that . We 're talking business here . We 're talking ratings . You should be talking people . [ scoff ] The same thing . Why don 't you give us your analysis , Ben ? To what do you attribute the ratings drop ? We 're only down 2 % . 2 % is 6 million viewers , and if they start channel switching , it 's war . You know that , Ben . We 're used to it . it happens all the time . But if we were still using blipverts instead of regular adverts , there wouldn 't be any channel switching . Blipverts have been off the air only 10 hours , and our ratings are actually 3.7 % down , not 2 % , as you suggest , Ben . I 'm going to reinstate blipverts . And that is final . [ keyboarding ] Nightingale 's Body Bank . Florence speaking . Can I help you ? Yes , I 'm looking for a body- - male . Any particular piece in mind , honey ? No , the whole thing . Name of Gorrister . Oh , yes . Heavy guy . He 's here , all right . He 's in Cryo , freezing down . I see . Thank you . Anything else ? Yes . You wouldn 't happen to have an Edison Carter , would you ? Mm , no one here by that name . But we do have a lot of Blank Does . Care to see them ? Is this him ? Yes , it is . Then let 's have a look . Well , his head is a bit dicey , but otherwise he looks good . Supposed to be some kind of a celebrity . Yes , he was . Look , Florence , what do I do- - I mean , what do I do if I want him ? Do ? Just pay and pick him up , honey . You want him alive or dead ? You mean he 's still alive ? Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to show you something truly remarkable from Research and Development . Get me Bryce on the link , please . Mr. Lynch 's latest development is of even greater significance than blipverts . This will in fact revolutionize television . This network has the world 's first completely programmable presenter . Bryce , would you please introduce us to Max Headroom ? What kind of sh-sh-sh-show is this anyway ? [ laughter ] This is not a show , Max . This is the executive board of Network 23 . Oh- - Oh- - Oh . Exec-Exec- - E-E-Exec- - You mean you 're the people who execute audiences . [ Max popping lips ] Heh ! Uh , this , of course , ladies and gentlemen , is a completely computer-generated person . Yes , t-t-t-tune in to Network 23 , the network that 's a real night blower . And I love-love- - love-love-love- - love those blip-blip-blip-blipverts . That 's enough , Bryce . Thank you . He 's got quite a sense of humor , doesn 't he ? Yes . I think I need to come see you , Bryce . This zone is reserved for complete bodies . Please unload and move on . Load number 28-dash-40 . Small organs to Zone Blue . Please have your deposit forms ready . You 'll make a lovely couple . He 's a good value at that price . Enjoy yourself . You idiot . Don 't you have any idea how catastrophic this whole thing could be ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Grossberg . It was an oversight . Oversight ? This computer-generated geek of yours knows everything that Edison Carter knew . He knows about the rebus tape . He knows about the blipvert effect . It 's a simple matter , really . Simple ? A reporter and his controller are both dead , and my position as president of Network 23 is jeopardized . There 's no reason to panic . I can simply erase his memory . Er-Erase ? What good is he to Network 23 without his memory ? Not all his memory . Just the parts pertaining to the rebus tape and the blipverts . And you 're sure this can be successful ? Completely successful . Then do it now . All right , where is he ? - [ parrot squawks ] - I don 't know . You don 't know ? He 's shifted his whole entire file set to some other place and memory . What ? Please , Mr. Grossberg . This is very unusual . I require absolute concentration . What has happened ? He 's gone . Gone ? He 's escaped into the system . Escaped ? Find him . You know ... I get the feeling there 's a lot of faces out there watching ... me , and I can tell you it brings a lump to my ratings . Yes , this is Network 23 , the net-net-network that puts you right ... where they want you to be . [ Female voice ] Good morning , Miss Jones . This is your daybreak call . It 's a lovely morning . The sun is shining , but there 's a slight chill in the air . Your breakfast is preparing , and your shower is ready . Good morning . Good morning . You feeling okay ? Yeah . Why ? It was quite a night . [ exhale ] What happened ? You don 't remember ? You had an accident . You mean we- - we didn 't ... No , we did not . Are you sure ? Maybe we did and just forgot . By the way , we didn 't get the recording of the rebus tape from Bryce 's lab . Your camera cut out . I got to get into some of your clothes . Edison , you can 't go back . And I 'll be talking to you about Zik-Zaks ' 1000-volt C-C-Christian converter ! Just plug yourself in , and your friends will see the light- - a very large flash of light . Ha ha ! Bryce , if you don 't get that computer-generated geek off my network , you will cease to have a future- - any future . Do you understand , Bryce ? It 's all right . I 've traced him . I 'm jamming his transmission codes now , if I 'm lucky . Lucky ? Well , he 's terrifically versatile . It 's rather exciting . This is not exciting , Bryce . This is catastrophic . I 'd k-k-k-keep-keep ... talking to you if I had time , but it 's not in my hands . I just haven 't got any- - hands . [ chuckle ] Or time . But I 'll see you again . And again and again and again . Look at the ratings . We went up 2 1 / 2 points just in the time he was on . Murray , I 'm going to need a live news feed override with an open EQ sometime in the next 45 minutes . What 's up ? I 've got a story that 's going to blow this network . Who 's in the field ? Edison Carter . Theora . He 's dead . Grossberg is holding a press conference this morning . Then I guess Edison will be broadcasting from the grave . How 's that for a story ? What is going on ? No going . They 've changed the codes . Okay . Let 's try the ventilation system . What is that ? It 's computer-generated , whatever it is . It looks like Edison . [ parrot squawks ] Mr. Carter . Hey , there . N-N-N-Nice of you to drop in . - I thought you were ... - Dead ? Yeah . So did I. Um , I 'm glad you 're not . Thanks , kid . Where 's the rebus tape ? I 'm afraid Mr. Grossberg 's got it . Was there another one ? There was only one . He 's r-r-r-right . But you don 't need one . You saw the tape . It 's in your memory . Therefore , it 's in Max ' memory . Max ? Max . - Max Headroom . - M-M-M-M-Max Headroom . He 's a computer-generated person based on you . He 's not perfected yet . But everything you saw is in his memory . Hi , Max . Hi , M- - Hi , Max . Edison , we can record Max ' memory on camera , and we 'll have the rebus tape . Uh , this will be the first time I 've ever shot material from beyond the grave , especially when it appears to be me . Let 's go on the line . Two minds but with one single memory . Ah . [ voices speeded up ] Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! - Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! - [ explosion ] [ phone beeps ] Cheviot . What do I do , Mr. Cheviot ? Do what you have to do , Murray . [ chatter ] [ Man ] Okay now . Here we go , here we go . Ladies and gentlemen , we have very sad news for you today . Network 23 regrets to announce its award-winning news reporter and on-air personality Edison Carter was killed yesterday while on assignment . You 're on the air live in five seconds . Edison Carter was more than just a popular figure on Network 23 . He was an inspiration to all of us . Edison Carter was one who always was striving - to reach the truth . - [ murmuring ] This is Edison Carter coming to you very much live and direct on Network 23 . The news of my death , Mr. Grossberg , is obviously premature . And now I 'd like your comment on the revolutionary form of advertising called ... blipverts . And their shocking and lethal side effects as demonstrated in this rebus tape . Okay , control , roll the tape . [ voices speeded up ] Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! [ Man ] Hey , here he is , here he is . Hey , looking pretty alive . [ Woman ] Ha ha ! - [ Woman # 2 ] All right ! - [ applause ] [ no audible dialogue ] And I-I-I 'll be back in a few moments with more from Network 23 . Hi . Hi . No , this is not a blip-blip-blipvert . This is Max Headroom on Network 23 . And I- - And I- - And I know that right now you 're looking at me and you 're thinking Wow , wow , he could become a star . So , so before you get the wrong idea about me , let me just say very humbly ... you 're right . I could . Now , I d-d-don 't want to be gloomy , gloomy , but what does the future hold ? Some say- - Some say it holds the promise of a young olive branch , which-which-which means I might have to turn over a new leaf in the future . How can you tell when our network president is lying ? His lips move .

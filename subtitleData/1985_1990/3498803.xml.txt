 This is Media-Break . You give us three minutes and we 'll give you the world . I 'm Casey Wong with Jess Perkins . Pretoria . The threat of nuclear confrontation in South Africa escalated today when the military government of that besieged city-state unveiled a French-made neutron bomb and affirmed that it would use it as the city 's last line of defense . The president 's first press conference from the Star Wars Peace Platform got off to a shaky start when power failed causing a period of weightlessness for the president and his staff . We 'll be back in a moment . Is it time for that operation ? This may be the most important decision of your life . So come down and talk to one of our qualified surgeons at the Family Heart Center . We feature the complete line of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha . You pick the heart . Extended warranties . Financing . Qualifies for health tax credit . we care . one critically injured . OCP the firm which recently agreed with the city to fund and run the Detroit Metro Police Department . president of OCP . Every policeman knows there are inherent risks in his job . you better stay out of the kitchen . Officer Frederickson escaped and identified this man . unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit sought in connection with the deaths of 31 officers . Today he is free while doctors at Henry Ford Hospital fight to save Officer Frank Frederickson . Frank . Attempted murder ? It 's not like he killed someone . This violates my client 's civil rights . now . you 're a scumbag and scumbags see the judge . Now get out of my police station and take Laughing Boy with you . Hi . transferring in from Metro South . Nice precinct . pretty good . You work for a living down here . Get your armor and suit up . sarge . any word on Frederickson ? - Still listed as critical . His wife must be going crazy . that 's me . - Manson . - Hi . What brings you to paradise ? I think the OCP 's moving a lot of new guys here . Omni Consumer Products . What a bunch of morons . They 're gonna manage this department right into the ground . - Where you from ? - Metro South .

We should strike . The funeral is tomorrow . Department requests all officers not on duty to attend . Any donations for the family may be given to Cecil as usual . I don 't want to hear any more talk about strike . we 're police officers . And police officers don 't strike . Murphy . Front and center . tiger ! come here when you 're finished fucking around with your suspect . This guy 's gonna be your new partner . meet Lewis . Show him the neighborhood . Murphy . Pretty neat . I better drive until you know your way around . I usually drive when I 'm breaking in a new partner . You really think the old man will be there ? Why invite us ? All the division heads are bringing their support teams . It 's big . They 're green lighting Delta City . No way . They never move ahead of schedule . Jones has the 209 series ready and wants to show off . Bob . - What ? When ED 209 ran into serious delays the old man ordered a backup plan . have a nice day . Probably to light a fire under Jones ' ass . - Yeah . - Old Bob here gets the assignment . Nobody in Security Concepts takes it seriously . I 'd go straight to the old man if I could . Don 't mess with Jones . man . I hear Jones is a real shark . twerp ? - Bob . What 's the problem with the police ? Their union 's been bitching ever since we took over . The usual stuff . But we 'll turn things around . Good . Very good . Let 's get started . My friends . I 've had this dream for more than a decade now . A dream which I 've invited you all to share with me . In six months we begin construction of Delta City . Where Old Detroit now stands . Old Detroit has a cancer . The cancer is crime . It must be cut out before we employ the 2 million workers to breathe life back into the city . Yes . Shifts in tax structure have made the economy ideal for corporate growth . in this case law enforcement have suffered . I think it 's time we gave something back . Take a close look at the track record of this company . You 'll see that we 've gambled in markets usually regarded as nonprofit . Hospitals . Prisons . Space exploration . good business is where you find it . we now have a contract to run local law enforcement . But at Security Concepts we believe an efficient police force is only part of the solution . we need something more . We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer . A cop who doesn 't need to eat or sleep . A cop with superior firepower and the reflexes to use it . Fellow executives it 's a pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement . ED 209 . The Enforcement Droid series 209 is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot . but that 's just a start . After a successful tour in Old Detroit we can expect 209 to become the hot military product for the next decade . - Dr. McNamara . - We 'll need a subject . sir . sir . Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a typical arrest and disarming procedure . use your gun in a threatening manner . sir . Please put down your weapon . You have 20 seconds to comply .

This setback could cost us millions in interest costs alone . sir . There 's a Robocop program I developed as a contingency against just this sort of thing . Thank you for your concern . - This is something we could ... - Wait a minute . Dick ! Maybe what we need here is a fresh perspective . Tell me about your plan . How long will it take ? We 've restructured the police department with some good candidates . We can go to prototype within 90 days . Very good . Get your staff together . I 'll expect a presentation in 20 minutes . sir . you go for it . Jones will be looking for you . Fuck Jones . He fumbled the ball and I was there to pick it up . huh ? That 's life in the big city . When do we start ? As soon as some schmuck volunteers . Murphy . TJ Lazer .

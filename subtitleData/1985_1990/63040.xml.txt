 Central Services We do the work , you do the pleasure . Hi , there . I want to talk to you about ducts . Do your ducts seem old-fashioned , out-of-date ? Central Services ' new duct designs are now available in hundreds of different colors to suit your individual taste . Hurry , while stocks last , to your nearest Central Services showroom . Designer colors to suit your demanding taste . ... from the Ministry of Information , Deputy Minister , Eugene Helpmann . Good evening , David . What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ? Bad sportsmanship . A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues . They just can 't stand seeing the other fellow win . If these people would just play the game , they 'd get a lot more out of life . Nevertheless , Mr. Helpmann . there are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information is too large and unwieldy . Information is the name of the game . You can 't win the game if you 're a man short . And the cost of it all seven percent of the gross national product . I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payer , people want value for money . That 's why we always insist on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges . It is absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention ... and for the Information Retrieval procedures used in their interrogation . Do you believe that the government is winning the battle against terrorists ? - Yes . Our morale is high ... We 're fielding all their strokes , running them out and consistently knocking them for six . They 're nearly out of the game . The bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year . Beginner 's luck . Thank you very much , Deputy Minister . Thank you , David . And a very Merry Christmas to you all . Scrooge was better than his word , He did it all , and infinitely more . And to Tiny Tim , who did not die , he became a second father , He became as good a friend , in the good old world . And so , as Tiny Tim observed , God bless us , everyone . Are you boys giving me the runaround ? Who 's there ? Who is that ? Father Christmas can 't come if we haven 't got a chimney . you 'll see . I hereby inform you , under Section 47 , Paragraph 7 of Council 0rder # 438476 that Mr. Buttle , Archibald , of 412 North Tower , Shangrila Towers , is to assist the Ministry of Information with inquiries and that he is liable to financial obligations specified in Council 0rder RBICZl907 IX . Sign here , please . Where are you taking him ? There . Thank you . Same again , please . Just there . Press harder this time . Good . What is this all about ? your receipt for your husband . Thank you . This is my receipt for your receipt . Mrs. Buttle , are you okay ? We 're Department of Works ! Department of Works . Careful with those bloody things . Don 't take any notice of them . Don 't touch me ! Why don 't you just get out of here We 'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy . Nothing to worry about . - It 's Tuttle downstairs who can worry . Tuttle ? His name 's Buttle . There must be some mistake . Mistake ? We don 't make mistakes . Bloody typical . They 've gone back to metric without telling us . Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? Buttle , Archibald . 0h , shit ! Mr. Lowry , would you step in here , please . Has anybody seen Lowry ? Has anybody seen Sam Lowry ? What ? Mr. Kurtzmann ! you 're up late . It is ? The electrics here are up the spout . yours , too ? I 'll be there as soon as I can . yeah . Thanks . Bye . What 's this gun for ? This one , Sister , is a 9-millimeter submachine gun used for close-quarter combat fighting . Very effective . Would you like to see it ? HELP the Ministry of Information HELP y0U Sam ! Jack ! Long time no see . What are you doing here , don 't expect to see you slumming it in records What 's the problem ? - No problem . Everything 's fine . Wonderful . Marvelous . Alison and the kids are fine . I 'm on Security Level 5 . So Helpmann relies on me more and more . It 's been a great year . you sound worried . - Worried , me ? If I 'm worried about anyone , Sam , it 's you . Look at you Sam . What ever happened to you ? Records ? Jack , it 's great to see you . I 'm going to be late . Sam , let a friend tell you : your life is going wrong . Records is a dead-end department . your security level 's worth a damn , It 's impossible to get noticed . - I know . Wonderful . Marvelous . Perfect . See you , Jack . Give my regards to Alison and the twins . Triplets . - God , how time flies . It 's a very clear delineation of picture . Mobile . Next ! I want to report a wrongful arrest . you want Information Adjustments . Different department . I 've been to Information Adjustments they sent me here for a form to fill out . have you got an arrest receipt ? - yeah . Is it stamped ? - Stamped ? No , there 's no stamp on it . I can 't let you have the form until this is stamped . Where do I get it stamped ? - Information Adjustments . It 's nothing . It keeps picking up old films . That can 't be right . The machine 's on the blink . It 's not the machine . There 's a mismatch on personnel code numbers Tuttle 's account should 've been debited 31 pounds , not Buttle 's . A mistake ! - It 's not ours . Isn 't it ? Whose is it ? - Information Retrieval . Expediting put in for electrical procedures for Buttle , Archibald , shoe repair operative , but Security has invoiced for Tuttle , Archibald , heating engineer . What a relief . Well , finish your tea . I don 't know what I 'd do if you got promoted . Don 't worry . - But if they did promote you ... I 've told you , I 'd turn it down . Really ? - Really . you 've been promoted . It 's your mother , isn 't it ? Pulling strings again . It 's time for you to grow up and accept responsibility . your poor father would be appalled at your lack of promotion . Mother , I just wish you would stop interfering . I don 't want promotion . I 'm happy where I am . No , you 're not . Jack Lint is a lesson to you . He doesn 't have your brains , but he 's got the ambition . you lack ambition . Luckily you 've got me and the Deputy Minister . Mr. Helpmann was close to your father . Mrs. Lowry , don 't get upset . Wait in reception. you 're giving her wrinkles . - you see ? Just try and relax , Mrs. Lowry . I 'll make you 20 years younger . Dr. Jaffe , you are a genius . Would you like to be Surgeon General ? I know simply everybody . They won 't know you when I 've finished . First , we remove the excess derma . Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes ... forehead . Now I lift the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wig , into the hairline . Now , a bit of sticky . Already she 's twice as beautiful as she was before . Mr. Helpmann was very close to your poor father . He was close to me . He still is . He 'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval . you 'll like it there . you 're not listening to me . What the hell is this , lady ? It 's a present for my son . Really ! I hope you like it . It 's very exclusive . What on earth is it ? - Something for an executive . Madame Lowry ! you look exquisite today . Merry Christmas . Hello . Merry Christmas . you remember my son , Samuel ? - 0f course . We 're joining Mrs. Terrain . - yes . This way . Mother , I thought we 'd be able to talk . - We will , we will . God , she 's got what 's-her-name with her . Well , Alma , how are you ? you look wonderful . Hello , Shirley . Thank you , Sparrow . Salt ? - Not yet . Sam , Happy Christmas . Thanks . Now , Alma , what are you going to have ? I can 't make up my mind whether to have the number one or two . What do you recommend ? - Between you and me , Madame , today the number two . - Thank you . Shirley , what will you have ? - Between you and me , Mademoiselle , today the number one . To hell with the diet ! I 'll have a number eight . A most perceptive choice , if I may say so . Messieurs ? - Steak , please . Rare . Quel numero ? - I don 't know which number . That one . - It 's fine . Thanks . Alma ! you wicked girl . you started your treatments . Say the number . you noticed . you have to say the number ! - Go away ! I 'll tell you about it . Number three . Mother , will you listen to me . Number 8 . Braised veal in wine sauce . It 's too exciting . I 've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman . Doctor Chapman ? The acid man ? Really , Ida , just because his techniques are revolutionary . I don 't go around calling Dr. Jaffe the knife man . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to ... - It 's all right . Steak ! Numero trois ! Mesdames , monsieur , bon appetit . - Merci . Acid , on the other hand , can be used for wonderfully subtle shading ... delicate nuances . Like a Rembrandt . And it 's quicker . If not for this complication which could have happened to anybody , I 'd have had this dressing off yesterday . Salt ? What were we saying ? - God , this isn 't rare . By the by , I saw the most wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemist 's . Gift tokens . Medical gift tokens . - How marvelous ! It 's good at any doctor 's and most major hospitals . It 's also accepted for gynecological examinations including Caesarian sections . Madame , I don 't know what to say , it never happens to us . I 'm going to do something about it straight away . Sam , can 't you do something about these terrorists ? It 's my lunch hour . Besides , it 's not my department . Actually , that 's something I 've been dying to tell you . Look . Sam 's being promoted to Information Retrieval . That 's wonderful . Congratulations , Sam . Stop it ! I 'm not being promoted . I 'm not going to Information Retrieval . So just stick it , mother ! Pepper ? I 'm going . you haven 't had your dessert . - I don 't want dessert ! I don 't want a promotion . I don 't want anything ! - you must want something . you must have hopes , wishes , dreams ? No , nothing . Not even dreams . Sam . 0h , God . Hello ? Central Services ? I 'm at 579B , Block 19 , Northwestern Section D. That 's Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway . I 've got trouble with my airconditioner . It 's an emergency . Thank you for calling Central Services . Due to staff shortages , we cannot take service calls between 2300 and 0900 hours . This has not been a recording . this is an emergency ! Thank you for calling Central Services . I 've got to have a heating engineer . Thank you for calling Central Services . Hello , Mr. Lowry . Who is this ? Put the phone down and raise your hands . What ? Who is this ? Nice and easy , now . Nice and easy . Keep your hands where I can see them . What are you doing ? Harry Tuttle , heating engineer , at your service . Tuttle ? Are you from Central Services ? I called Central Services . - They 're overworked . Luckily , I intercepted your call . What was that business with the gun ? Just a precaution . Just a precaution . I 've had traps set for me before now . Plenty of people in Central Services would love to get their hands on me . Are you telling me that this is illegal ? yes and no . 0fficially , only Central Services can touch this . Can you hold this ? But with the new regulations and rules , they can 't get decent staff . They turn a blind eye as long as I 'm careful . But if they could prove I worked on their equipment ... That 's a plate of a different color . Wouldn 't it be simpler ... - Can you hold this for me , please ? Wouldn 't it be simpler to work for Central Services ? No , I couldn 't stand the pape . It 's getting warm . - What couldn 't you stand ? I couldn 't stand the paperwork . Listen , this whole system of yours could be on fire and I couldn 't turn on a faucet without filling out a 27Bl6 . Bloody paperwork . 0ne has to expect a certain amount . Why ? I came into this game for the action , the excitement . Go anywhere , travel light , get in , get out , wherever there 's trouble , a man alone . Now they got the whole country 's sectioned off . Can 't move without a form . Found it . There 's your problem . Can you fix it ? - No , I can 't . But I can by-pass it with one of these . Fine by me . you expecting anyone ? - No . Wait here . Wait . The flashlight . Central Services . - Central Services . Ho , yes . - you rang ? - you rang ? Trouble with your air conditioning ? - Air conditioning ? No , it 's all right . It 's fixed . - Fixed ? yes . I mean , it fixed itself . Fixed itself , did it ? Machines don 't fix themselves . He 's tampered with it . Sorry you had a wasted journey . I think we ought to have a look . Have you got a 27Bl6 ? - 27Bl6 ? Now look what you 've done to him . Have you got a 27Bl6 ? - Not as such . But we 'll get one . It 's all right , it 's all right . I 'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork . Where would we be if we didn 't stick to the correct procedures - We 'll be back . We 'll be back . Thanks for coming . We 'll be back , you clever bastard ! Thanks , Lowry . you 're a good man in a tight corner . I just happen to work at the Ministry of Information . - What ? I just happen to know that Information Retrieval are looking for Archibald Tuttle . Heating Engineer . you wouldn 't by any chance , would you ? My good friends call me Harry . Information Retrieval ? The big boys . What do they want you for ? Time to go . you must let me give you something . How much will it be for the work ? Come on. you did me a favor . Just check the corridor . Listen , kid , we 're all in this together . I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious . What 's playing today ? - " Casablanca . " Mr. Lowry , step in here , please . Sam Lowry ! Thank God you 're here . We 're in terrible trouble . Look at this . - It 's a check . It 's the refund for Tuttle ! - Tuttle ? Buttle . I mean Buttle ! It 's been confusion from the start . He has been overcharged for Information Retrieval procedures and someone is trying to blame us ! Can I see ? I 've never seen a refund check before . I 'll bet it 's Jeffries . He believes people should pay more for their interrogation . And he loathes me . We 've got to get rid of it ! Send it to somebody else . Better still , send it to Buttle . It 's his . I 've tried that . Look at this . The Population Census has him down as dormanted . The Central Collective Storehouse computer has him deleted . Information Retrieval has him inoperative . Security has got him down as excised . Administration has him as completed . - He 's dead . Dead ? Well , that 's awful . We 'll never get rid of the damn thing now . What are we going to do , Sam ? - Could try the next of kin . There we go . Buttle , Veronica , Mrs ... What 's the number on the check ? 27156789l074328K Right into memory . Central Banking . Veronica Buttle . Mrs. Deposit . Thank God for that . Would you like some tea ? Problem . She doesn 't have a bank account . Well , that 's it then . I might just as well go and hang myself now . This could never have happened before this stupid 7th tier reorganization ! That 's Simmons doing . He and Jeffries always sit together at lunch . Bastards ! Perhaps we could lose the thing behind a filing cabinet ... Burn it , eat it ? - There is one solution . Drive out to Mrs. Buttle , let her sign the back of the check , she can cash it at the corner sweet shop . That 's brilliant , Sam . - I 'll even do it for you . Authorize the check . What 's the address ? What shall I do next ? Pink and blue receipts . Sign there , there and there . And sign the check , there . I think I 've broken a bone . My wrist is all limp . What a pathetic creature I am . I 'll do it for you . I 'll be on my way . you are good to me . Here 's looking at you , kid . - Here 's looking at you . Brazil , where hearts Were entertained in June We stood beneath that amber moon We interrupt thisprogram with news of a terrorist bombing ... And clung together , then Tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say When twilight beams the sky above ... Hello . Could you tell me ... - Piss off . I 'll never confess ! Come on , interrogate me . Mrs. Buttle ? Are you Mrs. Buttle ? My name is Lowry . Sam Lowry . I 'm from the Ministry of Information . I 've come to give you a check . It 's a refund , actually . There was a mistake . Mistake ? Not my department , of course . I 'm only Records . It seems that Mr. Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval . They don 't usually make mistakes , but ... I suppose we 're all human . What happened to the ... ? My coming here is rather unorthodox . Any payments are normally made through Central Computer , but as there were certain difficulties we thought rather than cause delay we 'd let you have it now . It being Christmas and all . My husband 's dead , isn 't he ? I assure you the Ministry is very scrupulous about following up and eradicating any error . But if you have any complaints I 'd be happy to send you the appropriate forms . What have you done with his body ? I don 't know anything about that . I 'm really just delivering the check . Look , if you wouldn 't mind just signing these two receipts I 'd be only too happy to leave you in peace . He hadn 't done anything . He was good ! What have you done with his body ? ! It isn 't being very helpful , is it ? I didn 't have to come here , you know . Are you all right ? Are you all right ? Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? - It 's you . Wait , stop ! I had nothing to do with it ! Wait ! Stop ! Go away ! - Her name 's Jill . Jill ? Jill who ? Jill who ? Layton . you 're a very good girl . What are you doing here ? I 'm waiting for my daddy . He 'll be pleased when he gets home . Sam , I 've just had the transport pool onto me . Do you know anything about a missing personnel transporter ? Personnel transporter ? What ? The pranets , I had a personal transporter . I 'll do the paperwork tomorrow . Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle ... Buttle 's check ? Can I forget it ? - yeah . What a relief . I 'm gonna have nightmares . Damn ! - What 's the matter ? I don 't suppose you happen to know how I can get around an IRQl3 . Information on suspects is classified , all inquiries through Information Retrieval . But they never tell you anything . But when they want something from us ... There 's one way round it . I could accept my mother 's promotion . No ! you can 't . you just turned it down . I didn 't sign the form . I did it for you . you didn 't . - I did . you didn 't . - I did . Why did you do that ? - Isn 't that what you wanted ? I don 't know . I don 't know what I want . Come on , before they turn the lights out . There is one way around it . I could always accept promotion to Information Retrieval . What are you doing ? What 's going on ? Emergency procedures . I haven 't got an emergency ! This is an emergency ... Here . Sign that . - What is it ? It 's a 27Bl6 . What do you think it is ? Where is he ? Spoor , come here ! I found it . Look there , a bypass on the transformer . you 've had that scab Tuttle here . What are you talking about ? - Who fixed your ducts ? They fixed themselves . - 0h , yeah ? Where did this come from ? 0ut of your nostril ? Central Services . They don 't take kindly to sabotage . This place is in a terrible state . Wait. you can 't leave it like this . Why not ? Just blow your nose and it 's fixed , isn 't it ? What have you done with his body ? ! Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure of your company At her apartment tonight from 20 : 30 to midnight to celebrate the completion Of her recent cosmetic surgery Thanks . It 's reply paid . - Is it ? Mother , I 'm sorry , but I 'm unable to come to your party you don 't have to sing it . - I don 't ? Aren 't you a bit late ? The party started an hour ago . yes , it 's backlog . Everybody complains . Was it all right otherwise ? Mr. Helpmann , I 'm keen to get into Information Retrieval . Mr. Helpmann , I 'm dying to get at this woman . Where 's your invitation ? - Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Mother ! Mother ! Sam , I 'm so glad you came . Mother ? - Come in . Mother , is that you ? - 0f course . Isn 't it wonderful ? The bandages came off just his afternoon . Come on , darling , join in the fun . Simply everybody 's here . Is Mr. Helpmann here ? Stop shoving ! Mr. Helpmann is here , and he wants to talk to you . Good . I want to talk to him . He says you 're the first person ever to refuse a promotion . He thinks you should see a doctor . Louis , you know Sam . Can you believe it ? It 's just me and my little knife . Snip , snip . Slice , slice . Can you believe it ? - Congratulations . But this is just the beginning . - Really ? 0f course. you 've seen her with her clothes off . Faces are a doodle compared to tits and ass . No hairlines . - 0h , really , Louis . I 've been looking for you everywhere . Mother , I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann . 0h , you stupid sod . - Dear boy ... what do you think of your mother now ? It will never last . Dr. Chapman , did you say something ? That technique , I 've tried it . 0h , a nice effect but highly unstable . In six months , she 'll look like Grandma Moses . At least mine don 't end up looking like they 've been mugged . What have you done with his body ? ! What happened to you ? - There 's a little complication . Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine . Nothing to worry about . He 's promised me these bandages will be off in a jiffy . There 's someone I want to meet . - I know , I know . Here we are . I 'm going to leave you two love birds in peace . Hello , Shirley . Come on . Want a drink ? Chase those years away . your mother and my mother have the idea that ... I 'm very flattered . I just don 't want you to be under any false impressions . It 's all right . I don 't like you , either . Sam ! - Jack . Excuse me , Shirley . Sorry . Do you remember Alison ? Alison , Sam Lowry . 0ld friend . - Alison , yes , of course . Well , you look different . - I 'm two years older . And she 's been to Dr. Jaffe . She doesn 't like me telling people . I knew something was different . - They used to stick out . yes , well , rather . I always used to wonder if they were real . What , my ears ? Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back . I always wondered if she wore falsies . False ears . Hello , Jack . you remember my wife , Alison ? - 0f course . Barbara , isn 't it ? How are you ? Barbara 's very well . How are you ? - Fine , thanks . Hello , Sam . Ida said you might be here . Have you got a minute ? Would you excuse us ? - 0f course , of course . Come on , Alison , Barbara . I need your help . Mr. Helpmann , I 'm glad to be of help . - And if I can help you ... your father and I were very close . 0f course , Jeremiah was senior to me , but we were close friends especially after the bombing . And now I keep his name alive at the office every day . It 's as though he was still speaking to me . " Ere I am , J.H. " The ghost in the machine . I know he would 've wanted me to help you . I promised your mother that I 'd take you onto the team at Information Retrieval . But I gather that you ... Well , actually , Mr. Helpmann , I 've changed my mind . I 've decided I 'd accept the transfer if I 'm not too late . Too late ? That 's for me to say . Then I ... Welcome to Information Retrieval . My name 's Lowry . Sam Lowry .

But Buttle 's heart condition wasn 't on Tuttle 's file . Come on , love , how are you getting on ? I need to know about ... We 'll bring Tuttle in and interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle . And juggle the books . What has Tuttle done ? - We suspect him of free-lance subversion . Free-lance subversive ? - I need Layton to wrap up the case .

I 'd spoil the wrapping . If I want you to trust me , then its only fair that I should trust you . Doesn 't it bother you , what you do at Information Retrieval ? Suppose you 'd rather have terrorists . How many terrorists have you met , Sam ? Actual terrorists . Actual terrorists ? - yeah . It 's only my first day . A roadblock . What you gonna do ? - Stay calm . Don 't slow down ! Don 't stop ! Please , do as I say . Go straight ahead . Go ! What the fuck are you doing , you idiot ? We did it ! We broke right through them ! We did it ! Faster ! Don 't let them see you . Just go ! Keep going ! Faster ! Go faster ! What if we lose the house ? - Don 't touch anything ! We did it ! We did it ! We did it ! 0h , no ! What would you like for Christmas ? - My own credit card . Why have we come here ? - Go away . Why don 't we go back to my flat ? - Forget it . you don 't trust me ? - Trust you ? you hijack my truck , loses me my job , have security men looking for me . I was only trying to help . - yeah . 0.K. you don 't trust me , I don 't trust you . What 's in that parcel ? you saved it from the lorry . It must be something very special . I saved you from the lorry . you 're not something very special . I 'm opening it . - Don 't touch that . Sam ! It 's me and Shirley . Mrs. Terrain ! That should hold it . What happened to you now ? My complication had a little complication . But Dr. Chapman says I 'll soon be up and bounding about like a young gazelle . you buying a Christmas present for your mother ? yes , a little something . Shirley and I come here regular-larly . We love romantic lingerie . Picture me in these . Are you all right ? you don 't deserve to be ! What a stupid thing ! How could you ? Look at these people ! It was a bomb ! I should 've opened it . I sat there with it next ... There 's your bomb , asshole ! Bribes , for official monkeys like you . Make yourself useful . Don 't touch her ! She 's hurt . Don 't touch her ! Stop ! Sam , no ! These helmets make your scalp itch . Don 't mention it . And they make you sweat . Half the time I can never see where I 'm going . It 's a great niagara of perspiration coming down . I 'm lucky . I got these thick eyebrows . That keeps it up and channels it out to the ears . He 's somebody from Information Retrieval . They hang around in lingerie . Where is she ? Jill , is that you ? Excuse me , sir . That is government property . Jill ! Answer me ! I 'm looking for a girl with blonde hair . Medium height , green eyes . I don 't know . They check all that at the depot . We can 't allow that . It 's more than our job 's worth . Jill , you must be here . you can fill in an application form if you 're a relative . Now do stop , sir , please . Sorry about that , sir . Regulations . This is a black eye for the department . I don 't care how you behaved when you were at Records . We are an executive branch . We 're proud of our reputation and we protect it . That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for ! I thought I told you to deal with it ! And what the hell is this mess ? An empty desk is an efficient desk ! Good God ! Queries from Security . Searches from Central Banking about a check . Notices from Accounting about unreturned receipts ! I have to find ... - Shut up ! I don 't know what 's going on here , Lowry . But you can 't intimidate us , with your friends and relatives in high places ! Now shape up ! Lime , I have to use your computer . Sorry , I 'm a bit busy . you seem to have a lot to do yourself . Shit ! Come off it , Jack . you can see if she 's been arrested . This case has become much more complicated since last we talked . But she 's innocent . She 's done nothing wrong . Tell that to the wives of the men she blew up today . She 's not alone in this . We just got a report that Tuttle wrecked an entire flat . It looks like in your block . I 'd keep my eyes open if I were you . Bye . you don 't think Tuttle the girl are in league ? I do . Everything 's connected . Cause and effect , that 's the beauty of it . 0ur job is to trace the connections and reveal them . This Buttle-Tuttle confusion was planned from the inside . She 's innocent , Jack . We 've always been close . - yes , Jack . Until this all blows over , just stay away from me . 0h , my God ! It 's you ! It 's you ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? your thermostat 's gone , and then some . What happened to my flat ? Hello . What ? It 's for you . But you don 't live here anymore . - What ? Do you know what this is ? It 's an H2206 authorizing the compulsory temporary requisitioning of this flat , for repairs . Don 't forget your receipt ! Sorry , but I 'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork . Tuttle . What are you doing ? It 's getting cold in here . It smells badly . It 's shit ! We 're filling up with shit ! Shit ! We 're all in it together , kid . Jill ! Jill ! 0h , God . Are you all right ? What happened to you after ... - your face . Are you hurt ? No , I 'm fine . I was worried sick about you . Who was that ? - That 's a friend of mine . 0h , God . Shit . We 'd better get out of here . Quick , quick . Are you sure this is all right ? - yes , yes , certain . My mother 's away for Christmas . She 's spending it at the plastic surgeon 's . The wraps come off tomorrow . Lock the door after me . And don 't answer the phone . Where are you going ? - I know a way to save you . Trust me . I can do it . - you can 't go without me ! Dawson , could you put me through to Mr. Helpmann 's office ? I can 't , sir. you have to go through the proper channels . And the proper channels are classified information . I see the Ministry 's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest . Thank you , Dawson . Goodbye , Mr. Lime . - Goodbye , Dawson . No , no , Arthur. you 're flat on the G ! It 's your breathing . Take a deep breath after " Noel " . Ready ? 1 , 2 , 3 . Ere I am , J.H. The ghost in the machine . Mr. Helpmann ? Jill ! Who 's there ? What do you think ? Is it me ? you don 't exist anymore . I 've killed you . Jill Layton is dead . Care for a little necrophilia ? Merry Christmas . Something for an executive ? She 's dead . This is a friend of mine .

I assure you , I 'm doing everything within my power . But the rules of the game are laid down . We all have to play by them . Even me . It 's all a mistake . you 've got to understand that . From the Department 's point of view , there is an own goal . I 'm not a terrorist. you know that . Please get me out of here ! Information Retrieval is expensive . you 're running up an enormous bill by not cooperating . Please , Mr. Helpmann . Help me find Jill . Jill. yes . Sam , I think I ought to tell you . I 'm afraid she 's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion . Thrown in the towel . Dead ? yes . It 's a bit confusing but it seems she was killed resisting arrest . No , it 's all right . I did that . The odd thing is it happened twice . A bit of a disputed call , I 'm afraid . All I can say is don 't fall at the last fence . The finish is in sight . See you in the paddock . Do cooperate . Think of your mother . Good luck , Keep your eye on the ball . Got to go . Can 't keep the orphans waiting . Don 't fight it , son . Confess . Quickly !

Take that mask off . you stupid bastard ! How could you do this to me ? - I 'm frightened . How do you think I feel ? you shit ! Shut up ! This is a professional relationship . No , you can 't ! No , Jack , please , no . No ! you okay ? - Tuttle ! Call me Harry . Ah , Mr. Lowry . So pleased you could make it . Right this way . It 's a sad loss . your mother was with her at the end . Mrs. Terrain has just received that most wonderful of gifts . She came to us physically new . She goes hence from us not so physically new . But the spirit never grows old . Madame Lowry . Mother ! Mother , mother ! Stop calling me that . Mother ! Mother , please ! Is this guy bothering you ? Mother ! Go away . This is very sacred moment . He 's got away from us , Jack . I 'm afraid you 're right , Mr. Helpmann . He 's gone . Tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say Now , as twilight beams the sky above Recalling thrills of our love There 's one thing I 'm certain of Return I will To old Brazil

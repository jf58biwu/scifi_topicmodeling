You mean that was in 1917 ? Time travel is not unknown in history . There is evidence that it happened more often than any suspect . But why me ? I don 't know the details of it . Only when it happens . And how I keep meeting Biggles than ? Is hypothetical ... I think Biggles is your " Time Twin " . " Time Twin " ... ? Listen , you have something stronger than tea ? It seems like an hour to your life is intrinsically linked to it . Do you think maybe ... ? The reason has something to do with it ? Where did you get this ? The second time I went back , Biggles and I were in a photo recon mission , and ... when I returned , I was holding this thing . Did Biggles tell you what that photography is ? Yes ! Some sort of secret weapon . Biggles seemed very concerned about it . I think this photograph is ... Mr. Ferguson ... The time is come for action ! What kind of action ? I prepared something for you . What for ? On next trip back ... This time ... we 'll send you to the battlefield properly equipped . Listen . Is there any way I get out of this ? I 'm afraid not . If the enemy has developed a weapon that alows then to break true the Allied lines , Germany can well win the first World War . History will be altered ... and you will be stuck in 1917 until the time reaches . And God knows what will happen with the rest of us . This is getting crazy , you know ! ? You must not fail !

And builds up , and builds inside him until they just ... Snap ! I 'm going to London . - I 'm going with you ! - Me too ! No Bill , someone has to stay here and handle the orders .

He 's in room 1231 . And a couple of good strong attendants , too ... Is your patient dangerous ? Of course not ! It 's just a little confused . He is wearing nun 's dress and ... has a gun ... Did you said a gun ? Yeah ... just a normal big gun . Jim , want you please tell me what is going on ... ? Okay Debbie , but I 'm telling you , no one will ever believe it . I keep falling through this hole in time going back to 1917 . Go on ! Do you believe me ? Well , if you say so , Jim . I guess I believe . Debbie , I keep going back to World War one ...

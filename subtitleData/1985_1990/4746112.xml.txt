 This is Media-Break . You give us three minutes and we 'll give you the world . Good morning , I 'm Casey Wong with Jess Perkins . Top story , Pretoria . The threat of nuclear confrontation in South Africa escalated today when the military government of that besieged city-state unveiled a French-made neutron bomb and affirmed that it would use it as the city 's last line of defense . The president 's first press conference from the Star Wars Peace Platform got off to a shaky start when power failed causing a period of weightlessness for the president and his staff . We 'll be back in a moment . Is it time for that operation ? This may be the most important decision of your life . So come down and talk to one of our qualified surgeons at the Family Heart Center . We feature the complete line of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha . You pick the heart . Extended warranties . Financing . Qualifies for health tax credit . And remember , we care . Three dead police officers , one critically injured . Police leaders blame Omni Consumer Products , OCP the firm which recently agreed with the city to fund and run the Detroit Metro Police Department . Dick Jones , president of OCP . Every policeman knows there are inherent risks in his job . If you can 't stand the heat , you better stay out of the kitchen . Although wounded , Officer Frederickson escaped and identified this man . Clarence Boddicker , unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit sought in connection with the deaths of 31 officers . Today he is free while doctors at Henry Ford Hospital fight to save Officer Frank Frederickson . Good luck , Frank . Attempted murder ? It 's not like he killed someone . This violates my client 's civil rights . Make it assault and I can make bail in cash , now . Listen , your client 's a scumbag , you 're a scumbag and scumbags see the judge . Now get out of my police station and take Laughing Boy with you . Hi . Murphy , transferring in from Metro South . Nice precinct . Yeah , pretty good . You work for a living down here . Get your armor and suit up . - No , you can 't get a cup of coffee . - Oh , sarge . - Stark , any word on Frederickson ? - Still listed as critical . His wife must be going crazy . - Murphy ? - Yeah , that 's me . - Manson . - Hi . What brings you to paradise ? I think the OCP 's moving a lot of new guys here . Omni Consumer Products . What a bunch of morons . They 're gonna manage this department right into the ground . - Where you from ? - Metro South . Welcome to hell . - Murphy ? - Yo . - Cut 10 guys loose on the east side . - Try to get up when you 're in a jam . Try to get a Medevac after you been jammed . I 'll tell you what we should do . We should strike . The funeral is tomorrow . Department requests all officers not on duty to attend . Any donations for the family may be given to Cecil as usual . I don 't want to hear any more talk about strike . We 're not plumbers , we 're police officers . And police officers don 't strike . Murphy . Front and center . Ooh , tiger ! Lewis , come here when you 're finished fucking around with your suspect . This guy 's gonna be your new partner . Murphy , meet Lewis . Show him the neighborhood . Glad to know you , Murphy . Pretty neat . I better drive until you know your way around . I usually drive when I 'm breaking in a new partner . You really think the old man will be there ? Why invite us ? All the division heads are bringing their support teams . It 's big . They 're green lighting Delta City . No way . They never move ahead of schedule . Jones has the 209 series ready and wants to show off . - Tough break , Bob . - What ? When ED 209 ran into serious delays the old man ordered a backup plan . 95th floor , have a nice day . Probably to light a fire under Jones ' ass . - Yeah . - Old Bob here gets the assignment . Nobody in Security Concepts takes it seriously . Fucking Jones , I 'd go straight to the old man if I could . Don 't mess with Jones . Be careful , man . I hear Jones is a real shark . - Who asked you , twerp ? - Bob . What 's the problem with the police ? Their union 's been bitching ever since we took over . The usual stuff . But we 'll turn things around . Good . Very good . Let 's get started . My friends . I 've had this dream for more than a decade now . A dream which I 've invited you all to share with me . In six months we begin construction of Delta City . Where Old Detroit now stands . Old Detroit has a cancer . The cancer is crime . It must be cut out before we employ the 2 million workers to breathe life back into the city . Yes . Shifts in tax structure have made the economy ideal for corporate growth . But community services , in this case law enforcement have suffered . I think it 's time we gave something back . Take a close look at the track record of this company . You 'll see that we 've gambled in markets usually regarded as nonprofit . Hospitals . Prisons . Space exploration . I say , good business is where you find it . As you know , we now have a contract to run local law enforcement . But at Security Concepts we believe an efficient police force is only part of the solution . No , we need something more . We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer . A cop who doesn 't need to eat or sleep . A cop with superior firepower and the reflexes to use it . Fellow executives it 's a pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement . ED 209 . The Enforcement Droid series 209 is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot . 209 is programmed for urban pacification , but that 's just a start . After a successful tour in Old Detroit we can expect 209 to become the hot military product for the next decade . - Dr. McNamara . - We 'll need a subject . - Mr. Kinney . - Yes , sir . - Will you give us a hand ? - Yes , sir . Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a typical arrest and disarming procedure . Mr. Kinney , use your gun in a threatening manner . - Point it at ED 209 . - Yes , sir . Please put down your weapon . You have 20 seconds to comply . I think you better do what he says . You now have 15 seconds to comply . You are in direct violation of penal code 113 , section 9 . - You have five seconds to comply . - Help me ! - Four , three , two , one . - Help me ! Help ! I am now authorized to use physical force . Somebody want to call a paramedic ? - Let 's go , Johnson . - You pull the plug on this thing ? All right , don 't touch him . - Don 't touch him ! - He didn 't hear the gun drop . He didn 't hear it ? ! Dick , I 'm very disappointed . It 's only a glitch . A temporary setback . You call this a glitch ? We 're to begin construction in six months . This setback could cost us millions in interest costs alone . Not necessarily , sir . There 's a Robocop program I developed as a contingency against just this sort of thing . Thank you for your concern . - This is something we could ... - Wait a minute . Dick ! Maybe what we need here is a fresh perspective . Tell me about your plan . How long will it take ? We 've restructured the police department with some good candidates . We can go to prototype within 90 days . Very good . Get your staff together . I 'll expect a presentation in 20 minutes . Thank you , sir . That 's how it is in the big leagues . You see an opening , you go for it . Watch your back , Jones will be looking for you . Fuck Jones . He fumbled the ball and I was there to pick it up . Too bad about Kinney , huh ? That 's life in the big city . When do we start ? As soon as some schmuck volunteers . Pretty fancy moves , Murphy . My son watches this cop show , TJ Lazer . Lazer does this whenever he kills a bad guy . - My kid thinks every good cop ... - You don 't want to disappoint him . Yeah , well , role models can be very important to a boy . Okay , I get a kick out of it . All units , sector nine ... Well , that 's ... Why don 't you drive ? Shit ! - I don 't believe it ! - What ? You burnt the fucking money ! I had to blow the door ! It 's as good as marked , asshole . You stupid , stupid asshole ! - Clarence ! - What do you want ? ! We got a cop on our tail . - Come on , speed it up . - Move it ! - We ain 't gonna outrun a cop . - Slow down . - Are you crazy ? - Shut the fuck up and do it ! Just do it ! This is 154 . We 're in pursuit of suspect . Request backup . - Roger , 154 . Backup unavailable . - Give me your piece . Backup ETA , 15 minutes . Bobby , get the door ! - Everybody load up ! - Let 's go , come on . - Okay . - All right , here we go . - What the fuck ? - Where 'd he go ? Emil ! He 's up here ! Get him ! Shit , Clarence , my leg . Leon , pick him up . - Ready ? - Nope , hang on . Bobby . - Can you fly , Bobby ? - Clarence , no ! Hit it ! This is 154 . We 've located that van in sector 3D . Where 's backup ? Backup unavailable . Estimate 20 minutes before units can arrive . Well , you call it . - Let 's's do it . - Okay . Go . Stay in touch . Freeze . Okay , let 's see those hands . Nice and easy . Sure . Mind if I zip this up ? We rob banks , but never get to keep the money . We steal money to buy coke , then sell the coke to make more money . - Capital investment , man . - Why bother ? We could just steal it . No better way to steal than free enterprise . Smoke ? No , those things will kill you . You want to live forever ? Don 't move . Go ahead and do it . Dead or alive , you 're coming with me . Lewis ? Lewis ! I got a situation in here . Okay , tough guy , get up . Get up ! Turn around and spread your legs . That 's right . Lewis , where are you ? You all right ? Hands on your head . Lewis . Let us take over from here , Emil . Your ass is mine . No ! Not yet , it ain 't . Well , what have we here ? You a good cop , hotshot ? Sure you are . You gotta be some kind of great cop . Come in here all by yourself . Where 's your partner ? Where 's your partner ? Guys , the other one was upstairs . She was sweet . I took her out . I bet that really pisses you off . You probably don 't think I 'm a very nice guy . Do you ? I think you 're slime . See , I got this problem . Cops don 't like me . So I don 't like cops . Well , give the man a hand . He 's all yours . - Look out . - Turn around , man . Hey , pretty boy . Hey , over here . I 'm out of ammo . Me too . Does it hurt ? Does it hurt ? Okay , fun 's over . Okay , let 's get out of here . Good night , sweet prince . Hey , wait up . Wait up . Murphy . - Get him over . - Clear . Ventilate him . Get the mask . Okay , hit the door . - Let me get pressure . - Mask him . Got a pressure of 60 pel . We 're gonna have to intubate this guy . All right , I got it in . Breath sounds ? - You 're in . - Other side . - Let 's get the mask trousers up . - Get the clothes off . Clothes off . Prep him for a central line . Let 's get some blood drawn . Type and crossing , six units . Pressure 's dropping . Central line 's in , getting pressure back . Normal saline . Can you do that , Dad ? - I really have to tell you something . - Blood pressure ? - I 've got 40 pel . - All right . Coarse D-fib . Okay , we gotta shock him . Put the Foley in . Let 's blow the mask trousers . - Okay . - Stand clear . Coarse D-fib . Let 's shock him again . Clear . Flat line . Let 's go , intracardiac epinephrine . - All right , it 's in . - No pulse . Let 's go ahead and shock a flat line and then quit . - Okay , everybody stand clear . - Clear . All right , that 's all we can do . Let 's call it . What 's the time ? 6 : 15 . Sharp . It 's starting to roll . Shit ! Bring in the L.E.D. Lock it down . - He 's on . - What 's the story ? - We saved the left arm . - What ? We agreed on total body prosthesis . Now lose the arm . Jesus , Morton . - Can he understand ? - We 'll blank his memory , anyway . We should lose the arm . What do you think ? He signed a release when he joined the force . And he 's dead . We can do pretty much what we want . Lose the arm . Shut him down . Prep him for surgery . The outer skin will be like this . It 's titanium , laminated with Kevlar . Go ahead , shake his hand . Come here often ? How you doing ? Got a hell of a grip . It 's 400 foot-pounds . He could crush every bone in your hand . All right , attach it to his shoulder . I like that . You 're gonna be a bad motherfucker ! Hey , hey . Look , he 's watching us ! This is for you . Happy New Year . We get the best of both worlds . The fastest reflexes possible today and a lifetime of on-the-street officer programming . It is my great pleasure to present to you Robocop . Come on , come on . That 's for you . - That 's for you . - Go , Robo . I 'm what you call a repeat offender . I will offend again . I get my orders from a higher source . Shut up , asshole . - Go through the side . - A cell is set for observation . What 's this all about ? - Who 's this ? - Sergeant John Reed . It 's official OCP business , so please , get lost . - We got four or five days ... - Hey , this is bullshit ! I take my orders from ... What is this shit ? When at rest , you 'll sit in a chair . Yes , I understand . What about tracking ? We check his exact location with one of these . How does he eat ? His digestive system is simple . This processor dispenses a paste that sustains his organic systems . It tastes like baby food . Knock yourself out . - Let 's start with tracking . - Give me a grid . - Got it ? - Clear . - Target . - Check . - Target . - Check . Now follow . Check . Voice stress analyzer . - It 's up . - One , two three . - Check . - Record . - Now playback . - Bring it up 50 % . Full frame . I think he 's ready . - We got it . - All right , clear out . What are your prime directives ? Serve the public trust . Protect the innocent . Uphold the law . That 's good . That 's very good . I fucking love that guy . - It 's Supercop . - Look at that fucking gun . Shit ! - This guy is good . - He 's not a guy , he 's a machine . What are they gonna do ? Replace us ? Come on . - Reed . - Yeah . He needs a car . Thank you . Sure . Anytime . Oh , yeah . Go get ' em , boy . I 'd buy that for a dollar . And guess what I 'm going to do now ? Happy birthday , Bixby . Is there anything else , sir ? Empty the register and put the money in the bag . Excuse me ? I said , give me your money , all of it , and don 't fuck with me ! Now move ! Open the safe , pops . Open the goddamn safe ! - We don 't have a safe . - Shit . There 's your goddamned safe ! Now open the son of a bitch . Quit stalling . You better open that son of a bitch ! Come on ! I 'm gonna blow her brains out . - I 'll open the safe . - Good boy . You better open that on the count of three . One , two ... Fuck me . Drop the gun . You are under arrest . Fuck me ! Fuck me ! Fuck me ! Thank you for your cooperation . Good night . I 'll buy that for a dollar ! No , please ! Don 't touch me ! - Get away ! Get away ! - We don 't want your money ! Take it easy . We don 't want to hurt you . Too much hair . I know ! We 'll give her a haircut . - Hey , hey ! - What ? There 's more hair down there ! No ! Don 't ! Please . Let the woman go . You are under arrest . Shit . You better back up , pal , because he 's gonna do her ! He 's gonna kill her ! He 's gonna kill her ! Your move , creep . No problem . It 's okay . Thank God . I was so scared . Thank you . Thank you . Madam , you have suffered an emotional shock . I will notify a rape crisis center . All units , sector six . Please close intersections ... I don 't care . Get those men by the stairs , now . Terrorism has never been a factor in city politics before . That changed today when former councilman Ron Miller entered City Hall with a gun . He 's on the second floor holding Mayor Gibson and his staff hostage . We do believe that Miller has killed one of the hostages . - Lieutenant , what 's next ? - We wait . Terrorism is very tricky . Massive and immediate retaliation is the best policy . Unfortunately ... - Excuse us . - Wait , where you going ? Statement , please . Hey , let 's have some crowd control . Come on , get these people back ! - Where the hell are you going ? - Keep him talking . One quick question here ! Who made you ? Are you invincible ? Okay , Miller . Don 't hurt the mayor . We 'll give you whatever you want . First , don 't fuck with me . I 'm a desperate man . And second , I want some fresh coffee . And third , I want a recount . No matter how it turns out , I want my old job back . - Okay . - And I want a bigger office . And I want a new car ! And I want the city to pay for it all ! - What kind of car , Miller ? - One with reclining leather seats that goes really fast and gets really shitty gas mileage . How about the 6000 SUX ? Yeah . Okay , sure . What about cruise control ? Does it have cruise control ? No problem , Miller . Let the mayor go , we 'll even throw in a Blaupunkt . Lieutenant , don 't jerk me off ! When people jerk me off , I kill them ! You want to see ? Get up , Your Honor . Get up ! Get up . Your public wants to see you . Nobody ever takes me seriously ! We 'll get serious now and kiss the mayor 's ass goodbye ! Robocop . Who is he ? What is he ? Where does he come from ? He is OCP 's newest soldier in their revolutionary crime management program . OCP spokesmen claim the fearless machine has crooks on the run in Old Detroit . Today , kids at Lee Iacocca Elementary got to meet in person what their parents only read about in comic books . Excuse me , Robo any special message for all the kids watching at home ? Stay out of trouble . More fighting in the Mexican crisis when American troops joined in a raid with Mexican Nationals against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco . Now this . Red alert . Red alert . You crossed my line of death . You haven 't dismantled your MX stockpile . Pakistan is threatening my border ! That 's it , buster . No more military aid . Nukem . Get them before they get you . Another quality home game from Butler Brothers . Today labor leaders agreed to sanction construction of OCP 's Delta City thereby creating one million much-needed new jobs despite questions about worker safety in dangerous Old Detroit . Robert Morton , vice president , Security Concepts , OCP . I can 't comment on Delta City . But I will tell you this : Security Concepts projects the end of crime in Old Detroit within 40 days . There 's a new guy in town . His name 's Robocop . Hey , hey , hey , Bobby-boy . Vice president . Congratulations . - Handball Tuesday night ? - I would , Bill but I 've got some models coming to my place . I 'd buy that for a dollar . Welcome to the club , Bob . You 're making a name for yourself in Security Concepts with Robocop . I try . Let me in on the bottom line , pal . I hear Jones was plenty pissed . You know , he 's got this killer rep , but it 's a smoke screen . He 's lost his teeth . The guy 's a pussy . Are we talking about the same Dick Jones ? He 's old , we 're young . That 's life . I gotta go . I got a meeting . Congratulations , Bob . Thanks . I remember when I was a young executive at this company . We used to call the old man funny names . " Iron Butt . " " Boner . " Once I even called him " asshole . " But there was always respect . I always knew where the line was drawn . And you just stepped over it , buddy-boy . You 've insulted me . And you 've insulted this company with your bastard creation . I had a guaranteed military sale with ED 209 . Renovation program . Spare parts for 25 years . Who cares if it worked or not ? The old man thought it was pretty important , Dick . You know he 's a sweet old man . And he means well . But he 's not gonna live forever . And I 'm number two around here . Pretty simple math , huh , Bob ? You just fucked with the wrong guy . You 're out of your fucking mind . You better pray that that unholy monster of yours doesn 't screw up . You hungry ? No , thanks . Oh , no . Damn rebels blew up the airport in Acapulco . Great , we were going there next week . Hey , what was that ? Hey , look . Bucket-boy 's online . Hey . Hey ! Halt . Stop ! Wait a minute ! - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . He just left . He just left ? Roosevelt ! We got a problem . Out of the way . Take a look at this . Shit ! Call Bob Morton . Jerry , book him . I 'll catch up with you later . Hello . I haven 't really had a chance to introduce myself . I 'm Anne Lewis . Do you have a name ? How can I help you , Officer Lewis ?

I have to go . Somewhere , there is a crime happening . Stop ! - What did you talk to him about ? - Nothing . - Shit . - Shit . Stop ! Hey , you there ! Stop ! You 're in a lot of trouble , officer . Come on . I was assured full cooperation by this precinct . One of your grunts screws it up , I 'll have your job ! - What 's the update ? - Hard to know . - We have a glitch or what ? - He wasn 't designed for somatic rest . He had a dream . A dream . This cop questioned him . I didn 't question him . I asked his name . He didn 't know . Oh , great . Let me make it clear . He doesn 't have a name , he has a program . He 's product . - Is that clear ? - Sure . Pull him in . Run a systems check , the works . Take him offline because he had a dream ? What , are you kidding ? Let 's get out of here . Listen , Reed . Try to keep one thing in mind : This project doesn 't concern cops . It 's classified . It 's OCP . You got it , mister ? Yeah , I got it . Good . Sorry , sarge . I fucked up . Forget it , kid . This guy 's a serious asshole . Give me all your money , bookworm , or I blow your brains out . Now fill it up on number seven . Don 't do nothing stupid , man . I 'm a good shot . I can hit you from here . Hey , man what you reading in there ? You a college boy or something ? I 'll bet you think you 're smart . Think you could outsmart a bullet ?

Situated near schools and shops this progressive development has a growth factor of seven . Wow . Can you do that , Dad ?

Where is Clarence Boddicker ? Okay . - Shit . - Let 's talk . Son of a bitch ! There 's just something about the way it sounds : " Vice president . " It just turns me on . God , you girls are so great . I love to be with intelligent women . Smart is so sexy . I know . Sometimes , I could just think of something and it could just get me so horny . Yeah , well , a mind is a terrible thing to waste . I get bored so easily . And you need lots of stimulation , Bobby . Yes , I do . - Don 't move . - I won 't . Bob , save some for me . Don 't worry . Must be the champagne . Stay here . How you doing ? Bitches , leave . Gee , Bobby . Bye . You gonna call me ? The fuck are you doing ? Do you know who I am ? If you think you 'll get away with this , you got ... Goddamn it ! Stop ! I 'll give you anything you want . Just , please , don 't kill me . Hello , buddy-boy . Dick Jones here . I guess you 're on your knees about now begging for your life . Pathetic . You don 't feel so cocky now , do you ? Whatever he 's paying you , I 'll double it right now . You know what the tragedy is here ? We could have been friends . But you wouldn 't go through proper channels . You went over my head . That hurt . But life goes on . It 's an old story , the fight for love and glory . It helps if you think of it as a game . Every game has a winner and a loser . I 'm cashing you out , Bob . I don 't think I want to pay that , Sal . I don 't give a shit what you want . I set the prices here . Listen , Sal , maybe you haven 't heard . I 'm the guy who owns Detroit . You want space in my marketplace you 'll have to give me a volume discount . Not into discounts . Joe , show the man what we brought him for Christmas . Think about it , chum . Good business is where you find it . Okay , let me try to put this in perspective . You 've killed a bunch of cops . Word around is that you 've got a lot of heavy connections downtown . You make a lot of my friends nervous . A lot of people want to see a guy like me put a guy like you out of business . I don 't know . Maybe I 'm just not making myself clear . I don 't want to fuck with you , Sal . But I got the connections . I got the sales organization . I got the muscle to shove enough of this factory so far up your stupid wop ass that you 'll shit snow for a year . Frankie , blow this cocksucker 's head off . Guns , guns , guns ! Come on , Sal ! The Tigers are playing tonight . I never miss a game . Just kidding . Go ! Come quietly , or there will be trouble . Fuck you ! Oh , shit ! Clarence Boddicker you are under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . Fuck you ! Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute ! I 'm protected , man . I 've got protection ! - You have the right to an attorney . - What is this shit ? ! Goddamn it . Goddamn it ! Listen to me ! Listen to me , you fuck ! It 's another guy ! He 's OCP . He 's the senior president . Anything you say may be used against you . It 's Dick Jones ! Don 't you care , you cocksucker ? I work for Dick Jones ! Dick Jones ! He 's the number two guy at OCP ! OCP runs the cops ! You 're a cop ! Cop ... Yes , I am a cop . I don 't like it either , but listen ! You listen to me , asshole ! You 're talking about shutting down a major metropolitan police force ! Without cops , this city would tear itself apart ! The union voted for a strike last night ! We lost five guys last week ! We 're getting creamed out there . Book him . What 's the charge ? He 's a cop killer . Shit ! Just give me my fucking phone call . I understand . The lawyers will have you out in 24 hours . Just don 't say anything else . Jesus , you really screwed up . Don 't you care ? I work for Dick Jones ! Dick Jones ! I work for Dick Jones ! He runs OCP ! OCP runs the cops ! Come in , officer . I don 't usually see anyone without an appointment but in your case , I 'll make an exception . You are under arrest . On what charge ? Aiding and abetting a known felon . Sounds like I 'm in a lot of trouble . Better take me in . I will . What 's the matter , officer ? I 'll tell you what 's the matter . It 's a little insurance policy called " Directive 4 . " My little contribution to your psychological profile . Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown . What did you think ? That you were an ordinary police officer ? You 're our product and we can 't have our products turning against us . Still a little fight left in you . Maybe you 'd like to meet a friend of mine . I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake . Now it 's time to erase that mistake . Get me Hedgecock ! There 's trouble in the tower ! Prepare to fire . - Wait a second ! - He 's a cop , for God 's sake ! - You can 't do that ! - We have orders to destroy it ! - Oh , shit ! - You 're maniacs ! Fire at will ! Move in ! Murphy , it 's me . Lewis . Level three ! He 's on level three ! Over here , over here ! Open fire ! It 's back . Big is back . Because bigger is better . 6000 SUX , an American tradition . Good evening . I 'm Jess Perkins with Casey Wong . Top story : Santa Barbara . Ten thousand acres of wooded residential land were scorched in an instant when a laser canon aboard the Strategic Defense Peace Platform misfired today during routine tests . It was a day of mourning for the families of 113 people known dead at this hour . Among them , two former U.S. presidents who had retired in the Santa Barbara area . A day of mourning for a country . Police union representatives and OCP continued negotiations today in hopes of averting a citywide strike by police scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight . Justin Ballard-Watkins has more . They 're still on duty . But what about tomorrow ? That 's the question we put to people in the crime-plagued Lexington area . They 're public servants . They got job security . They 're not supposed to strike . It 's a free society . Except there ain 't nothing free , because there 's no guarantees . You 're on your own . That 's the law of the jungle . - Be very careful . - Excuse me , please . Remodeling . Hi , Barbara . Listen , I 'm here to see Dick Jones . But when I 'm done , I 've got some free time . Maybe you could fit me in . He 's expecting you , Mr. Boddicker . You can keep the gum . Hey , Dickie-boy . How 's tricks ? That thing is still alive . What are you talking about ? The police officer who arrested you , the one you spilled your guts to . Take a look at my face , Dick . He was trying to kill me . He 's a cyborg , you idiot ! He recorded every word you said . His memory 's admissible as evidence ! You involved me ! You 'll have to kill it . Well , listen , chief . Your company built the fucking thing . Now I gotta deal with it ? I don 't have time for this bullshit ! Suit yourself . But Delta City begins construction in two months . That 's 2 million workers living in trailers . That means drugs , gambling , prostitution . Virgin territory for the man who knows how to open up new markets . One man could control it all Clarence . Well , I guess we 're gonna be friends after all . Richard . Destroy it . Gonna need some major firepower . You got access to military weaponry ? We practically are the military . Did you bring the gun ? The precinct was deserted . Half the force didn 't show up for work today . Everyone else walks out at midnight . I guess we 're on strike . I wasn 't sure what you needed . I sort of grabbed things . Your gun . You asked for this ? I brought you some food . No , thank you . I 'm not hungry . You may not like what you 're going to see . It 's really good to see you again , Murphy . Murphy had a wife and son . Where are they ? Well , after the funeral she moved away . - Where did they go ? She thought you were dead . She started over again . I can feel them . But I can 't remember them . Leave me alone . Happy birthday , Dave . She 's from me . Well , hey , can I have you both ? Sure ! We 've had our shots . I 'd buy that for a dollar . Hey , Emil .

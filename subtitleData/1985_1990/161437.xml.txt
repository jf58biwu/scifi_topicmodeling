 Turn . There 's another . Circuit board epsilon 14598 , red corridor 357 . - Re-routed . - Turn . And another . Circuit board theta 29555 , blue corridor 212 . What 's happening , guys ? I thought we were playing poker ? - Didn 't you get the message ? - What message ? A skutter went bananas and rewired the maintenance decks upside down . We 've got over 2,000 wiring faults . Don 't breathe . Don 't touch anything . - The ship 's a gigantic booby trap . - No poker , then ? We can 't find the auto-destruct system . It 's wired up to something . Tell the Cat . It 's taken me ages to mark these cards . - We can 't touch anything ? - Not until we get the all-clear . - How long 's that ? - God knows . Milk shake and a crispy bar . Poker 's gone for a burton . - That was a very dumb thing to do . - I wasn 't thinking . Cancel . Clear . I said touch nothing , didn 't I ? I just ordered a shake and a crispy bar . - How do we switch it off ? - Only the Captain can override it . - Dead . - Or a senior officer . - Dead . - I suppose , really , I should have updated the system . Could we trick it into thinking one of us is the Captain ? No . It checks his voice and brain scan . Think of something . You 're supposed to have an IQ of 6,000 . Think of something . - Well ? - I 've collated every single option , and there are three realistic alternatives . One - sit here and get blown up . Two - stand here and get blown up . Three - jump up and down , shout at me , then get blown up . - There must be something ? - Perhaps we could try a mind-swap ? It 's something we tried once on the Nova 5 . It uses exactly the same science as generating a hologram . We wipe all your brain patterns and put them on a storage disk . Then we transfer the Captain 's mind from his hologram disk into your empty brain . - You tried this on Nova 5 ? - Oh , yes . - Did it work ? - No , but I 'm sure I know what went wrong . - So , I 'll have the Captain 's mind ? - Yes . Then , hopefully , the machine will think you 're the Captain , and you can override it . - But where will my mind be ? - On this . We couldn 't find the Captain 's disk , but Brown was executive officer . Yeah . Brown 's got clearance . - What 's that for ? - It 's a mental emetic . - A what ? - A mind enema ... - To flush out your brain . - Nobody 's flushing ' out my brain . - We 'll transfer it back . - You 're not sticking that in my head ! - It 's our only chance . - Smeg off ! Look , man , I 'm not asking just for me . I 'm asking ... I 'm beggin ' you , do it for the sake of my suits . Are you gonna let my scarlet PVC morning suit with the imitation penguin-fur collars get blown to smithereens ? Look , I agree , it 's a stupid idea . It almost certainly won 't work , but the very worst that can happen , the bottom line , is that you spend the rest of your life as a gibbering vegetable . But if the rest of your life is 30 seconds , what the hell ? Do it . Keep that safe . It 's Lister 's mind . - What 's going on ? - No time to explain , but the auto-destruct system has started , and we need you to deactivate it . Something 's wrong . Something 's different . Wait a minute , I never used to be a man ! - Look , we 'll explain later . - Why have I got male sexual organs ? If we don 't override the auto-destruct in the next 20 seconds , those sexual organs will be in orbit around the nearest planet , along with every one else 's organs , sexual or otherwise . security clearance 0-1-0-1-0-1 . - Sen-smegging-sational . - Well done , fink face . - Three ... - What a brilliant plan . - Two ... - Just great . It was wired to the warning system , - but not the bomb . - So where 's the bomb ? We haven 't got a bomb . - What ? - I got rid of it ages ago . - Why didn 't you say ? - You never asked . Fine . Terrific ! But remember this - you 're getting my underwear bill , buddy . - You awake ? - Yeah , can 't sleep . - Probably those kippers . - Nothin ' wrong with kippers . But kippers vindaloo ? It can 't be good for you . A curry every night cannot be good for you . It 's certainly no good for me . I 'm thinking of getting a canary . - Why ? - To check if it 's safe to come in . - It 's not that bad ! - Not that bad ? You don 't sweat sweat , you sweat madras sauce . - Why the sudden interest in my diet ? - It 's not just your diet , Lister . It 's your health in general . You eat crap , you don 't exercise , you smoke , you drink ... Frankly , it 's beginning to show . - I 'm OK . - You 're getting porky . Porky ? Last week , during that lights failure , your silhouette was cast onto the wall . - I thought it was Alfred Hitchcock . - Are you sayin ' I 've got a gut ? You 've got more gut than a Turkish butcher 's shop . No , really , have I put on weight ? You 've reached that age , Listy . When you 're younger , you can eat and drink what you like and still climb into your 26-inch-waist trousers and zip them closed . Then you reach that age - 24 , 25 - your muscles give up , wave a white flag , then without warning , you 're suddenly a fat bastard . I 'm not fat , I 'm porky ! Have you never held up a frog by its head ? You know how its belly sticks out above its spindly little legs ? That 's what I see when you get down from the bunk . Maybe you 're right . Yeah , I 'm gonna start working out in the gym . Of course , you could always ... - No , you 'd never agree to it . - What ? We do a swap . My mind in your body , yours in mine . You saw how easy it was . Lend me your body for a while , and I 'll get it fit . Plenty of exercise , sensible diet , no more booze , no more ciggies . It 'll be like a 12,000-mile service for your body . - And in the meantime , I 'm a hologram ? - It 's only for a couple of weeks . You 're talking like it 's a pair of hedge trimmers or somethin ' . I 'd return it intact . More than intact , it 'd be fitter . Rimmer , you 're not having my body . Why are you worried ? How can I treat it any worse ? You admit you don 't look after it properly . I would . What do you say ? No welchin ' . Of course not . - A fortnight . - 14 days . - Two weeks . - Absolutely-doodly . This hat is smeggin ' stupid . I look like Captain Emerald . - Holly , do somethin ' about it , man . - OK , Dave . Brutal . What 's this under his nails ? Oh , my God ! I 'm going to have this dirt carbon dated . Luncheon , sir . Ah ! Food . Real food . To eat , perchance to taste . It 's exactly as you ordered , sir . Lightly poached Mimian bladder fish , four dozen oysters , duck 's feet in abalone sauce ... I can touch , I can taste , I can smell ! Roast suckling pig stuffed with chestnuts and truffles . - Mmm ! - Mashed potato . - With cream and butter ? - A pint of cream and a pound of butter . Let the orgy commence ! How 's the diet goin ' ? Do you know , I think I went temporarily insane . It was just too much . I haven 't tasted food in three million and two years . I was like an animal . - I want my body back . - It won 't happen again . - It 's out of my system . - MY system . Why are you smoking ? - One cigar ! - You should be gettin ' me fit . - I 'll start tomorrow . - You better bleeding ' had . Hey ! What are you doin ' dressed like that ? Why do you want to look like Goalpost-Head ? Have you flipped ? You want to look like a man with ears so large that they pick up satellite TV ? Why do you want to look like that smeg-head Rimmer ? Because ... I am that smeg-head Rimmer . Please ! These are supposed to be women ? Ah , this is what I call training . That letter , that letter , that letter . There . Hey , hey , hey ! I 've got you now , buddy ! J-O-Z-X-Y-Q-K . - That 's not a word . - It 's a cat word . - Jozxyqk ? - That 's not how you pronounce it . - What 's it mean ? - It 's the sound you make when you trap your sexual organs in something - " Jozxyqk ! " - Is it in the dictionary ? - It could be . If you were reading in the nude and closed the book too quick ... " Jozxyqk ! " Ah ! What a session ! What a work out ! No pain , no gain , Listy . - On the scales . I 'm weighing you . - No need . See that stomach . Hasn 't been that flat in years . - Scales , please . - There 's really no need . On the scales ! - You 've put on two stone ! - Of course I have . I 've been taking yeast extract , building up your body . - Take the robe off . - Why ? - Take it off . - You 're not seeing my naked body . - It 's mine ! - What 's he hiding ? - Off with the robe . - Just ... Off ! Oh , this ? This is a hernia-prevention belt . - I forgot to take it off . - It 's a girdle . - ' Course it isn 't . - It 's got dangly things for stockings . They 're for attaching extra weights to , so you can get fit as you walk around . I want me body back now . Look , OK . I went a bit bananas at first , but that 's all over now . It 's in my interest to get you into shape . This could be a regular thing . 14 days a year , I have your body . In fact , next year , I 'd like the last two weeks of July . - I want it back . - One last chance ? - No more troughin ' . - I promise . And take that girdle off . It doesn 't suit me . Holly , lights ! That 's it ! I 'm completely sick of it . - Mmmph ? Mmmm ? - That is IT ! - What is it ? - You 've been porkin ' again . - I have not ! - I want my body back now . - I 've only had it a week ! - This wasn 't the deal . You 've welched . And what 's this in the bin ? Me locks are in the bin ! - You said you pinned ' em up ? - I did but they ... fell off . Fell off ? Science lab , now ! It 's the middle of the night . Kryten 's on down time . Now . How much did you smoke ? Me lungs feel like they 've been through a cheese grater ! - You got your body back . Leave me alone . - Oh ! I only have a few rollies . It feels like you 've smoked an entire Cuban tobacco harvest . - I had the odd one . - No respect , that 's what . You 've shown my body no respect whatsoever . You 've treated it like smeg . Look ... You 've given me breasts . There 's a distinct cleavage there . One week in my body and you 've given me a bosom . These scales are wrong . These scales have to be wrong . It 's average for your height . Rimmer , it would be average for my height if I happened to be a pregnant hippo . You weren 't exactly Charles Atlas to start with , were you ? You haven 't been treating my athlete 's foot . Frankly , I was afraid of touching it . I told you , you have to wash and powder my feet three times a day , and buff with a pumice stone . I couldn 't touch those things three times a day . I was only brave enough to remove your socks once . Look at my stomach . Look at it ! Paint " Goodyear " on it , you could float me over the Super Bowl . Look , I refuse to take the rap for that body . I added a few pounds to its already ample frame , but it was a wreck before I got anywhere near it . A wreck ? If it was a car you would be an insurance write-off . Nothing works . Your taste buds are clapped out . You 've killed them stone dead with 25 years of non-stop curries . All the aches and pains you never mention ? Twinges in your back , crimps in your neck . Oh , and a little tip - urine should only be green if you 're Mr Spock . It 's the last time you borrow it , that 's for goddamn sure . What about next year ? We agreed . Last two weeks in July . Why do you want it ? It 's a wreck . Unfortunately , if you can 't get two weeks in the Caribbean , Grimsby 's better than nothing . - You can 't back out . - I only said that to get it back . Do you think I 'm mad ? You are never borrowing my body again . Never . Get some sleep . You 'll feel different in the morning . I 'm really not sure about this . You 're programmed to obey . Get on with it . - Surely , we should ask him first ? - I told you , he 's perfectly happy about the situation . Then , why did we chloroform him ? And why did he struggle ? I 'm in charge , Kryten . I 'll take full responsibility . - But , sir ... - Science lab , pronto ! If he comes around , give him another whack . Are you awake , man ? Rimmer ? No , please . No ! Play message . That 's why I 've taken Starbug and done a runner . Cat . Cat ! You want my what ? ! - It 'll only take a few hours . - You want my body ? I need your body to get mine back . You 've already lost one body . Come on ! You really expect me to lend you mine ? I 'm a hologram . How else am I supposed to chase him ? I need your body . One question . Would you let a garbage truck driver use your Rolls-Royce ? How else can I pilot White Midget ? I 'll do it . - Turn around and head back to the ship . - I told you not to follow me . Leave me alone or you-know-what happens . I think he means it , man . He 's flipped . It must be cream cake poisoning . - I 'm going in . - He must be bluffing . - Say he isn 't ? - It 's gastronomic terrorism ! - We can 't just let it happen . - Go ahead , punks . Make my day . - You 're right . He 's bluffing ' . - Smeg Get him ! This is getting stupid . Back off , let him go . - We 're almost on him . - It 's too dangerous . Let him go . Chickens ! Oh , smeg ! What the smegging ' smeg 's he smeggin ' done ? He 's smeggin ' killed me ! - Whoops ! - Are you all right ? - You 're going to go spare . - What is it ? You 're going to go absolutely spare . - You 've lost me arm ! - I 've lost your watch too . - You bastard ! - No , you 're right . It 's my fault . My hands are up ... Well , my hand is up ! You think this is funny ? No . But this is ! Oh , hello . It 's Captain Chloroform . Please , Mr David , sir . My guilt chip is already in overdrive . I feel terrible ! You feel terrible ? What about my head ? I had to obey him . It 's in my programming to obey all humans , no matter how insane . Dinner is served , sir . Lettuce and a grated carrot . I 'm on this for six months . What 's wrong ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . I was asleep , OK ? Then Plastic Percy puts a sponge on my face and out go the lights . It was an order ! Just one night , I promise . I 'll give it back first thing tomorrow . Maybe Thursday .

I 'm gonna be able to see my wedding dress . Wow . I wonder where we live . I bet it 's a big house with lots of kids . How many kids ... Doc ! What the hell are you doing ? Marty . It 's just a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator . She was asking too many questions and no one should know too much about their future . This way when she wakes up she 'll think it was all a dream . Then what did you bring her for ? I had to do something . She saw the time machine . I couldn 't just leave her there with that information . Don 't worry . She 's not essential to my plan . Doc . Here 's our exit . you 've gotta get out and change clothes . Right now ? It 's pouring rain . Wait five more seconds . Right on the tick . Amazing . Absolutely amazing . Too bad the post office isn 't as efficient as the weather service .

Because I used it on Jennifer there wasn 't enough power left to knock your son out for a full hour . Damn ! look at this ! It 's changing . I was framed ! of course ! Because this Hoverboard incident has now occurred Griff now goes to jail . your son won 't go with him tonight and that robbery will never take place . future history and this is the proof ! but no matter . Let 's go get Jennifer and go home ! buddy . What 's this ? It 's a souvenir . 50 years of sports statistics . Marty . what 's the harm in bringing back a little info on the future ? maybe we could place a couple bets . I didn 't invent the time machine for financial gain ! The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity . where we 're going the perils and the promise . " Why ? I 'm all for that . What 's wrong with making a few bucks on the side ? I am going to put this in the trash . Great Scott ! 3793 Oakhurst Street age 47 . Forty-seven ? That 's a hell of a good face-lift . Doc ? They used her thumbprint to assess her ID . Since her thumbprint never changes over the years they simply assume she 's the Jennifer of the future . we gotta stop them . What are we gonna say ? That we 're time travelers ? They 'd have us committed . She 's clean . That means we take her home . Home ? To Hilldale ? Lt 'll be dark by the time we get out there . That 's it . They 're taking her home to your future home ! We 'll arrive shortly thereafter get her out of there and go back to 1985 . You mean I 'm gonna see where I live ? I 'm gonna see myself as an old man ? Marty . That could result in ... Great Scott ! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self ! The consequences of that could be disastrous ! what do you mean ? I foresee two possibilities . coming face to face with herself 30 years older and she 'd simply pass out the encounter could create a time paradox the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe ! that 's a worst-case scenario . be very localized limited to merely our own galaxy . that 's a relief . Let 's go . I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself . The skyway 's jammed . It 's gonna take us forever to get there . And this stays here . I didn 't invent the time machine to win at gambling . I invented a time machine to travel through time ! Doc . Doc Brown invented a time machine . Hilldale . lobos and zipheads . they ought to tear this whole place down . Jennifer . Whoa ! You all right ? Yeah . but I think you can walk . you should reprogram . It 's dangerous to enter without lights on . JENNIFER : Lights on ? look . Just take it easy and you 'll be fine . And be careful in the future . The future ? Mrs. McFly . AUTOMATED VOICE : Broadcasting beautiful views 24 hours a day you 're tuned to the Scenery Channel . I 'm in the future . I get married in the Chapel O Love ? is that you ? I gotta get out of here !

OLDEST LORRAINE : I can 't believe this window 's still broken . when the scenescreen repairman called Daddy a chicken Daddy threw him out of the house . we can 't get anybody to fix it . look how worn out this is . Marlene is that he loses all self-control when someone calls him chicken . George ? I can 't let them think I 'm chicken . Can 't let them think I 'm chicken . you 're right ! OLDEST LORRAINE : About 30 years ago your father tried to prove he wasn 't chicken and he ended up in an automobile accident . you mean with the Rolls-Royce ? Automobile accident . let 's find Jennifer . I don 't believe it . I live in Hilldale ? McFly . stay here . Just change clothes . I 'll holler . I wanna check out my house . We can 't risk you running into your older self . let 's go . Where 's Jennifer ? Where 's Jennifer ? Hilldale . This is bitching . four point five zero . That will be $ 174.50 . Here . old timer . This is a rough neighborhood . Where 's my receipt ? Right here . Here it is . PARROT : Hello . Hello . How about a tip ? That accident caused a chain reaction that sent Marty 's life straight down the tubes . your father 's life would have turned out very differently . The man in the Rolls-Royce wouldn 't have pressed charges Marty wouldn 't have broken his hand and he wouldn 't have given up on his music and he wouldn 't have spent all those years feeling sorry for himself . nice pants . I think the real reason your mother married him was because she felt sorry for him . " Mom " ? Such a sweet girl . Art off . OLDEST LORRAINE : I think maybe she deserves ... 87 and the Weather Channel . bringing you the world 's weather 24 hours a day . Weather conditions remain the same ...

Why isn 't she home yet ? Mom . She should have been home hours ago . I 'm having a hard time keeping track of her these days . please . Thank you . I guess . I don 't know . OLDEST LORRAINE : Aren 't you and Jennifer getting along ? Mom . you know . telephone . It 's Needles . it 's for you . I 'll take that in the den . Excuse me . Retract . please . McFly ? Needles . Needles ? did you take look at that little business proposal of mine ? Needles . NEEDLES : What are you afraid of ? it 'll solve all your financial problems . I could get fired . huh ? The Jits will never find out . God . and I 'll handle it . Unless you want everyone in the division to think you 're chicken . Needles . Nobody ! NEEDLES : All right . Prove it . All right . Needles . Here 's my card . Scan it . I 'm in . McFly . I 'll see you at the plant tomorrow . Chicken . McFly ! I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced . You are terminated ! Terminated . No ! sir . It was Needles . Needles was behind the whole thing . And you cooperated . I didn 't . It was a sting operation . It was illegal . I was setting him up . read my fax ! no . I cannot be fired . I 'm fired . this is heavy . What am I going to tell Jennifer ? Jennifer . Jennifer . am I glad to see you . Go out the front door . I 'll meet you there . But it doesn 't open . There 's no doorknob . Press your thumb to the plate . What plate ? what does this fax mean ? an office joke . Kind of a joke fax . I heard you yelling . calm down . I wasn 't yelling . Needles and I were just kind of joking . Jennifer . have you lost your job ? you know ... I 'm young ! I 'm old ! Marty ! Marty ! come quick ! Quick ! She encountered her older self just as I predicted . She 'll be fine . Let 's get her back to 1985 and then I 'm gonna destroy the time machine . Destroy it ? What about that stuff about humanity where we 're going and why ? as this incident proves . And I was behaving responsibly . You can imagine the danger if the time machine were to fall into the wrong hands . My only regret is that I 'll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era the Old West . But time traveling is just too dangerous . Better that I devote myself to studying the other great mystery of the universe women . brace yourselves for temporal displacement . Did we make it ? Are we back ? We 're back . Let 's put her in the swing . and you can come back in your truck and wake her . When she awakens here in her own house and it 's dark you should be able to convince her that it was all a dream . Wait a minute . We 're just gonna leave her here on the porch ? The disorientation will help convince her that it was all a dream . How long do you think she 's gonna be out ? I 'm not quite sure . She received quite a shock . Could be for a few minutes . a couple of hours . You better bring smelling salts back with you . Doc . Einie . Don 't worry . She 'll be fine . I don 't remember bars being on these windows . I 'll be back at my lab dismantling this thing . Right . What the hell ? wait . Wait a minute . What are you doing in my room ? Help ! Rape ! Mom ! Okay . Okay . help ! sucker ! it 's okay .

Mom ! what are you saying ? You 're actually defending him . I had it coming . He 's my husband and he takes care of all of us and he deserves our respect . Respect ? Your husband ! How could he be your husband ? How could you leave Dad for him ? Leave Dad ? are you feeling all right ? I 'm not feeling all right ! I don 't understand one damn thing that 's going on around here straight answer . they must have hit you over the head hard this time . I just want to know one thing . Where 's my father ? Where 's George McFly ? your father is in the same place he 's been for the past 12 years . Oak Park Cemetery . No . No ! This can 't be happening ! 1973 . no ! no . This can 't be happening . This can 't be ... Marty . All of it . Doc ! When I learned about your father I figured you 'd come here . Then you know what happened to him ? 1973 ? Marty . I know . DOC : I went to the public library to try to make sense out of all the madness . shut down so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers . Doc . how can all this be happening ? It 's like we 're in hell or something . I can 't imagine hell being much worse . boy . awful mess . Attaboy . the time continuum has been disrupted creating this new temporal event sequence resulting in this alternate reality . Doc . here . Let me illustrate . Imagine that this line represents time . the future and the past . somewhere in the past the timeline skewed into this tangent creating an alternate 1985 . me and Einstein but reality for everyone else . Recognize this ? It 's the bag the sports book came in . because the receipt was still inside . I found them in the time machine along with this . It 's the top of Biff 's cane . Old Biff from the future . Correct . It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine with the sports almanac . Holy shit . while we were in the future Biff got the sports book went back in time and gave the book to himself at some point in the past . Look . It says right here that Biff made his first million betting on a horse race in 1958 . He wasn 't just lucky . He knew because he had all the race results in the sports almanac . That 's how he made his entire fortune . Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass . The almanac . Son of a bitch stole my idea . He must have been listening when I ... It 's my fault . The whole thing is my fault . If I hadn 't bought that damn book none of this would have ever happened . it 's all in the past . You mean the future ? Whatever . It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused and why the time machine must be destroyed after we straighten all of this out . Right . So we go back to the future and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine . because if we travel into the future from this point in time it will be the future of this reality in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother and in which this has happened to me . No . Our only chance to repair the present is in the past at the point where the timeline skewed into this tangent . In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances where and when Young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac . I 'll ask him . Bulletproof vest ! Great flick ! Great frigging flick ! The guy is brilliant . what the hell 's going ... Hey ! What the hell are you doing in here ? Biff . ladies . How did you get past my security downstairs ? There 's a little matter we need to talk about . forget it . No . Not money . Gray 's Sports Almanac . girls . Party 's over . kid . What else you know about that book ? you tell me how you got it . where and when . All right . Take a seat . Sit down ! 1955 . That was when . 1955 . That was the date I went back ... That was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm . You know your history . Very good . I 'll never forget that Saturday . I 'd just picked my car up from the shop 'cause I 'd rolled it in a drag race a few days earlier . I thought you crashed into a manure truck . How do you know about that ? My father told me about it . Your father ? Before he died . Yeah . Right . minding my own business . This crazy old codger with a cane shows up . He says he 's my distant relative . I don 't see any resemblance . " How would you like to be rich ? Sure . So he lays this book on me . He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event till the end of the century . and I 'll never lose . " What 's the catch ? No catch . Just keep it a secret . he disappeared . I never saw him again . and he told me one more thing . wild-eyed scientist or a kid may show up asking about that book . And if that ever happens ... Funny . I never thought it would be you . you 're forgetting one thing . What the hell is that ? you little son of a bitch ! there he is ! hey ! yeah ! kid . Jump . A suicide will be nice and neat . What if I don 't ? Lead poisoning . Biff ? They 're gonna match up the bullet with that gun . I own the police . they couldn 't match up the bullet that killed your old man . You son of a ... I suppose it 's poetic justice . Two McFlys with the same gun . Idiot . What the hell ? Doc ! You 're not gonna believe this . We gotta go back to 1955 . I don 't believe it . 1955 . Unbelievable that Old Biff could 've chosen that particular date . It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance almost as if it were the temporal junction point for the entire space-time continuum . it could just be an amazing coincidence . Damn ! Got to fix that thing . All right . Time circuits on . time circuits on ? we 're not going back now . Yep . what about Jennifer ? What about Einstein ? We can 't just leave them here . Marty . Assuming we succeed in our mission this alternate 1985 will be changed back into the real 1985 instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie . Jennifer and Einie will be fine and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place . Doc . What if we don 't succeed ? We must succeed . it 's like I was just here yesterday . Marty . You were . isn 't it ? sunrise should be in about 22 minutes . You go into town . Track down Young Biff and tail him . Old Biff will show up to give Young Biff the almanac . must not interfere with that event . so that he 'll leave 1955 and bring the DeLorean back to the future . Right . grab the almanac any way that you can . both of our futures depend on this . Doc . Here 's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact . I 'll stay here and try to repair the short in the time circuit . we don 't risk anyone else stealing the time machine and I won 't risk accidentally running into my other self . Other self ? Yes . There are now two of me here and there are two of you here . The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955 the younger me that helps the other you get back to 1985 . Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower ? Yeah . That event doesn 't happen until tonight so you must be very careful not to run into your other self . Let me give you some money . I have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities . Get yourself some ' 50s clothes . Doc . Something inconspicuous . Doc . This is Marty . Over . Marty . This is Doc . Are you there ? Doc . I 'm at the address . It 's the only Tannen in the book but I don 't think this is Biff 's house . It looks like some old lady lives here . WOMAN : Biff ! Yeah . Biff ? Grandma . When are you coming back ? and I want you to rub my toes some more . you old bag . KIDS : Give us our ball back . What ball ? That ball ! What ball are you talking about ? KIDS : Give us our ball ! What ball ? Biff ! Is this your ball ? KIDS : Yeah ! Is it your ball ? You want it back ? KIDS : Yeah . Go get it . it is Biff 's house . I 'm on him . Over . Hey . Terry . she 's all fixed up just like new but I couldn 't get her started . You got some kind of kill switch on this thing ? you just gotta have the right touch . Nobody can start this car but me . the bill comes to $ 302.57 . 300 bucks ? 300 bucks for a couple of dents ? Terry . it was horse shit . The whole car was full of it . We had to pay Old Man Jones 80 bucks to haul it away . too . Now I ought to get something for that . You want something for it ? We 'll go inside . You can call Old Man Jones . If he wants to give you a refund ... Terry . I 'll break his neck . The manure . I remember that . Biff . Four cans for a $ 300 job ? I couldn 't even have lunch in the shop . Makes me nauseous . I should get a case of oil out of you for a 300 buck job . You 've been inside . It smells worse than the bathroom at a gas station . yeah . Biff . Never gonna go away . Last time I do you a favor . Last time . Thanks a lot . Let me see . Lorraine . look at it ! You 're going to look so good ! You 're going to look ... lookey what we have here . Lorraine .

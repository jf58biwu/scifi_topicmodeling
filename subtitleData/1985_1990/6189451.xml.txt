 On the planet Gyllenblå rules President Ratio Rasch . He has forbidden the inhabitants to laugh . It transforms them into passive and obedient followers . Laughter is soon forgotten . Then all hope for change there . But from the Earth , Dr. Krull , transformed into a spaceship . He has two children , and with them a good dose of healthy infant laughter . - Help , we 're crashing ! - Ha , ha ! - There 's nothing to laugh about ! - I 'm not laughing . Ha , ha . - We can smash ourselves to death on the ground . - Ha , ha , ha . - Do you hear that ? - It sounds like something alien . - We 're alive at least . - Yes , but where are we ? It looks as if we 're on the moon ! Look ! - Is he dead ? - I think so . - We 'll have to bury him . - We haven 't got a shovel . He 's called Rasch . What should we do with him ? I don 't know ... But I need something to drink . Yes , we must look for water . 3O OOO light years in this case . - 3O OOO ! Do you understand what that means ? - No , but it seems a long way . ... and when the children landed on Gyllenblå they found themselves in danger , because it was forbidden to laugh ! - Frederick is gone ! - What ? He 's gone ? What do you mean ? Wait here ! Since the children brought a force that could be fatal for the prevailing reason of the luminary . And their arrival prompted in the abandoned part of the city . - Aren 't you eating , Epicycle ? - I 've no appetite . I feel strange . - It 's probably just the air in the sewers . - No , that 's not it . It 's something else . There are signals . Yes , I ... I 'm ... hyper-sensitive . Time in ... in prison has made me ... how should I say telepathic . - What 's the signal ? - It 's weak ... but still clear . I think it sounds like someone ... laughing ! It 's impossible . It 's been eradicated . - What are you laughing at ? - At the spaceship . It looks like Dr. Krulls head from this far away . Look , a cave ! What if ... What if there are beings from another planet ... - ... where laughter still lives on ! - it 's Impossible ! We must find them before the reason police get hold of them . Can 't we look for them ? - What if there are nasty animals here ! - No ... Ah , let 's go on ! It 's scary even though we 're police . - Well ! - Well what ? - " Well what ? " . Where are the kids ? - Kids ... - Yes , what we know is ... - It seems strange ... Continue ! Yes ... it seems as if they 've disappeared into the ... in the cabinet . - Open it , then ! - Yes , it 's probably not appropriate , lady . Hmm ! - Where is Krull who lives here ? - Also in the cabinet ! What are you saying ! ? Break down the door ! Now were taking it calmly . There are laws . It 's actually a crime scene . Now I ... Thank you , thank you . - What are you doing ? It 's urgent ! - We need to read the writing apparatus . I 'll speak to your superiors ! - Aren 't you afraid ? - Me ? Afraid ? Ha , ha ! Look ! The laughter-indicator is lit ! Look ! Look ! - We can 't go any further . Back ! - Through the cave ? Never ! We 'll swim across ! Come on , coward ! - But what about our clothes ? - Take them with you ! - It was most irrational ... - And without teachers ! During school hours ... Hello , Central ! We have found two naked children of school age . Should we take them to the reason school or directly to the institution ? - Where in all space are you from ? - From Vällingtorp Don 't worry about him . He giggles still he 's so very childish ! - Why are you naked ? - He dropped the clothes in the lake ! The girl is okay , but there 's something wrong with the boy ... I hope that our colleagues will take them to school . But you never know what they have for service regulations far into space . - I 'm a little worried , of course . - I wonder what happened to the dog . Can you hear anything ? - Who is sought ? - May I speak with the principal ? We found them at the lake . We thought you might be able to receive them . - Do you see who she resembles ? - Yes , Mrs. Jorgensen . You shouldn 't whisper ! It 's punishable . Come with me now . Hey , gang ! Here it is ! In here . Be so good ! Yes , yes , screening is mandatory . Take a place on the light ! I repeat : Take a place on the light ! - The boy first ! - Go on , then ! Name ? - I repeat : Name ? - Fredrik Heden . One name is enough . From now on , you are student number 23 Fredrik . Can you repeat ? Number 23 , Frederick . Screening shows health : type good . Their brains have all the organs that regulate rational behaviour . Are they from another planet ? Their human kind could come from Gyllenblås uncharted underside . - 24 Cecilie , show your necklace . - 24 Cecilie , show your necklace . It 's not mine . It belongs to Rasch ! - Rasch ! - The correlation is unclear . I think we must treat these children with the greatest caution . - She seems angry , that principal . - Mmm . That 's it , dear young newcomers . I 've never seen anything like it . Do you think it 's intelligent ? I don 't know . You never know how people from other spheres think . We 'll make an attempt . Hold the gun ready ! Good day ! Do you understand what I 'm saying ? It doesn 't sound particularly intelligent . It looks sad . It seems that he wants us to follow . He is intelligent , wiser than many in the police force . Ask me ! - Think about what you 're saying . - Police Chief Lagerström is on the way . Then maybe we can open the cabinet ... Look here ! There 's nothing that drives it ! No motor . Nothing . Nothing ? Have you never heard of the imagination ? It is the strongest power source available in the whole universe . I 'm Eon from Gyllenblå . Who are you ? - It looks more oppressed than us ... - You shouldn 't judge someone by their coat . - The skin is deceiving , as my mother said . - Can you laugh ? No , it does not seem so . What a disappointment ! I thought that laughter would come here from another planet . He may not be alone . He may just be a pilot . - Those who laughed ... - Only not if the reason police take them . Are you a pilot ? It couldn 't be more funny ! - Don 't you ever laugh ? - No ! Not in work time anyway ... Good day , revered teacher ! This is the reason sphere . It 's Gyllenblå . It 's a mother for the good path we should go . From the core to the edge , as far as our eyes can see . We 're going to struggle with reason . We are becoming more and more . See the reason crushes the war . The sphere 's heart hits We will win this battle . victory , it is ours . - Long live president Ratio Rasch ! - Hooray ! Hooray ! - Quiet ! What are you giggling at ? - He looks so ridiculous . We 're going to welcome two new students from another planet . Go ahead , 23 Frederick and 24 Cecilie , and stand up . Try to keep a straight face ! Welcome speech ! 17 Galaxia . As a senior student , I greet you welcome to reason class . Reason lesson Kl 3498 . Questioning begins ! 45 Korana , lift your head ! I 'm quite concerned , unfortunately . If I may advise we take the boy to the treatment institution today and give him the required dose . Our new laughter serum is infallible ! Infallible , yes ... They never really ... recover . My laughter Indicator gives a reading for that 23 Fredrik . - It 's not as fun with readings ... - The robot doesn 't need to instruct me . Sorry ! Frederick , watch it ! Faster , tin can ! We should probably tackle him here with us ... Subtitles by Squashy Hat ( 2015 )

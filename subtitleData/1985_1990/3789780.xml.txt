 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf . The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak . The only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the crew . We 've travelled through the galaxy for three million years , and discovered that the highest form of life is Man and the lowest is a man who works for the post office . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC ) ( WOMAN ON TV ) Oh , Jim , didn 't you say we have to seize our moments ? ( SNORTS ) ( MAN ) This is our moment , right here and now . Let 's seize it together . ( WOMAN ) But , darling , I 'm dyingl ( MAN ) I know , Carol . Dr Graham told me everything . - Busy , are you , Dave ? - Hol ! I 'm watching the film . - Just wondered if you were bored . - No , no . - You 're not bored , then ? - No , go away ! ( WOMAN ) But , darling , I 'm dyingl ( MAN ) I know , Carol . Dr Graham told me everything . I 've just finished reading everything . I 've now read everything written by anyone ever . - Go away ! - You know what the worst book ever is ? - I don 't care ! - " It 's A Funny Old Game " by Kevin Keegan . Let me watch the film . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC ) I 'm at a loose end . I don 't know what to do . Why don 't you read everything again ? I thought I might pass the time creating a perfect replica of a woman , capable of independent decision-making and abstract thought , and absolutely undetectable from the real thing . - Why don 't you ? - I don 't know how . I couldn 't even make the nose . - Is there something you want ? - If you 're not busy . - Would you erase some of my memory ? - What for ? If you erase the Agatha Christie novels , I can read ' em again tonight . - How do I do it ? - Just type " holmem " . " Password override . " Then " novels , Christie , Agatha " . Then press erase . - I 've done it . - Done what ? - Erased Agatha Christie . - Who 's she , then ? You just asked me to erase all Agatha Christie novels from your memory . Why ? I 've never heard of her . That 's because I 've just erased her from your smegging memory . - Why 'd you do that ? - You asked me to ! - When ? - Just now ! - I don 't remember . - I 'm going to bed . This 'll go on all night . ( WOMAN ) I 'm dyingl ( MAN ) I know , Carol . Dr Graham told me everything . ( ROMANTIC MUSIC ) Off ! Had a good day , Lister ? Scrummed enough choccies ? Watched enough drivel , have you ? You 're turning into a sad middle-aged woman . Next , you 'll be varnishing your nails and buying girdles . And what 've you done that 's so great ? I 've achieved 17 things off my daily goal list , whereas you 've never achieved anything ever . - I went to the officers ' block . - When ? - This morning . - But it hasn 't been decontaminated ! - You said it had last week ! - No , it was on last Thursday 's list ! - And you haven 't done it yet ? ! - Tomorrow . It 's on tomorrow 's daily goal list . Item 34 , right after " learn Portuguese " . Thanks a lot . Don 't tell me . Why were you mooching around up there , anyway ? I was looking through Kochanski 's dream recorder . She dreamed about me three times . So ? Clean my teeth , please , Holly . You don 't dream about someone that you don 't feel for . I once dreamed about a baboon . It doesn 't mean I want to sleep with it . - Must 've meant something . - Shave , please , Holly . Lister , you should take a good long look at yourself , then you 'd see just how ridiculous you appear to other people . If you 'd let me have Kochanski 's personality disk , I could find out . If you were a Love Celibate , you wouldn 't have these problems . You only knocked around with those prats from the Love Celibacy Society because you could never get a date . No , I agree with their philosophy that love is a sickness that holds back your career and takes all your money . You let your mum buy your " casual " clothes . There 's nothing wrong with my casual clothes . Your trousers were so short , you could see your knees . What about Yvonne McGruder ? That was a date . She 'd been hit on the head by a winch . She had concussion . She was crazy about me . - She called you Norman . - She went to bed with me . Yeah , because she thought you were somebody else . Serves her right for being concussed , doesn 't it ? Rimmer ! You don 't know what love is . Yes , I do . Love is a device invented by bank managers to make us overdrawn . Lights . Rimmer , love is ... Love is what makes us different from animals . What makes us different from animals is we don 't use our tongues to clean our own genitals . Lights ! Rimmer , are you awake ? Rimmer ! Are you awake ? What ? Yes , Mum , I 'm just packing my satchel . - Where am I ? What time is it ? - I don 't feel very well . - Half past three ? ! - I feel really ill . Well , you are really ill . No , I mean REALLY ill . I 'm going down to the medical unit . I don 't feel very well . Lights . Ah , Miss McGruder , where were we ? ( PANTS ) I feel really hot . Hey , this is mine . That 's mine . All this is mine . I 'm claiming all this as mine . Except that bit . I don 't want that bit . But all the rest of this is mine . This has been a good day . I 've eaten five times , slept six times and made lots of things mine . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna see if I can 't have sex with something . Aow ! Yeah ! S - E-X , you know I want itl Aowl S - E-X , I 'm gonna get itl S - E-X , I think I found it ... Oh , it 's you ! Hey , monkey , you 're sick . Sick , helpless and unconscious . If you weren 't my friend , I 'd steal your shoes . Time for a snack . This way . Aow ! Emergency . There 's an emergency going on . It 's still going on . It 's still an emergency . Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry to White Corridor 159 ? This is an emergency announcement . Food ! ( MACHINE ) Today 's speciality is chicken Marengo . I 'm gonna eat you , little chickie , I 'm gonna eat you , little chickie . I 'm gonna eat you , little chickie Ah-ah , too slow , chicken Marengo . Too slow for this cat . Hey ! This chicken 's faster than I thought ! Quick ! Lister 's fainted ! He needs help ! Didn 't you hear me ? Lister 's in trouble . The monkey - ooh-ooh-ooh ! - has fainted . Quick ! Come now . Is there something wrong with you ? Lister 's collapsed ! - Yeah ? - He needs help ! - And ? - And he might die . Aw , no ! That 's too bad . I really liked him , too . - So , come and help him . - And interrupt my lunch ? ! What 's more important , his life or smegging lunch ? That doesn 't even deserve an answer . Right . OK . You come with me . You get a stretcher . ( RIMMER ) Down . Down . Stop . Let the medicomp take my temperature . Lister , they 've got to learn . Down , down ... Slowly ... Ah , now very , very , very slowly forward . - Ah ! My eye ! - Lister , they 've got to learn . - I nearly lost an eye ! - How about an anal reading ? - I feel fine now . - Well , you 're not fine . It 's your own smegging fault for going up to the officers ' deck . - I just wanted a look around . - In Kochanski 's quarters , and look what 's it got you . I 've got a touch of pneumonia . Three million years ago , it was pneumonia . - Since then , it 's mutated . - Why didn 't I ask her out ? What 's the worst she could 've said ? She could 've said , " No , you 're a filthy , greasy , disgusting object " I wouldn 't be seen dead with . " She could 've said yes . Stranger things have happened . Only two spring to mind - the spontaneous combustion of the Mayor of Warsaw in 1546 and that incident in 12th-century Burgundy when it rained herring . There 's this theory I had . Everyone 's got two people inside , your confidence and your paranoia . Your confidence goes , " You 're great . You 're sexy ! Everybody loves you ! " Your paranoia says , " You 're stupid , useless and everybody hates you . " That 's odd , Lister . According to this reading , you 're clinically dead . My confidence would be just about to persuade me to ask Kochanski out , and as I walked up to her , he 'd go off to Hawaii . I 'd be left with paranoia , saying , " She 'll laugh in our face . " Sometimes , Lister , you can be quite perceptive and thought-provoking . Other times , like this , you rant like a complete loony . - Just take me to me bed . - All right , Lister . OK , you now how it works . Release the mechanism very , very gently . Possibly a gnat 's more gently than that . Quick ! Get an umbrella ! Get an umbrella ! Get an umbrella ! Get an umbrella ! Get an umbrella ! Get an umbrella ! Necrobics . Hologramatic exercises for the dead . It 's raining ! It 's raining ! Get an umbrella ! It 's raining . It 's raining ... Holly , what 's going on ? - What ? - What 's happening ? Um , Hercule Poirot 's just stepped off the train . If you ask me , they all did it . Why do we have you ? We 'd be better off with a bucket of slop . If you 've got a complaint , just come out with it . Don 't hide behind hyperbole . - Why is it raining fish ? - I 'd be lying if I said I knew . The only comparable incident is in 12th-century Burgundy . ( BELL RINGS ) It 's really going to be one of those days . Hey , you 're awake ! - I just woke up . - I 've brought some presents ! - You shouldn 't have bothered . - Well , I 'm that kind of guy ! Let 's see what we 've got in the magic bag . I got you some grapes , - and I got you got you an orange . - Thanks . I feel better already . Well , all this enormous generosity has made me tired . I 'm going to bed . Ah , yes , indeedy . - You 're awake . - But I 'll be asleep in a minute . - How do you feel ? - Fine , but I 'm trying to sleep ! Shut up , you stupid moggy ! Out of that bed ! Well , I 'm gonna take my presents back ! - How do you feel ? - Hurt ! - I feel great . - Listen , Lister , you had a fever . - Yeah . - And you started to hallucinate . - Yeah ? - Only your hallucinations ... were solid . - What do you mean ? - They were real , alive , solid . - Solid ? - Solid . - What do you mean ? ! - OK , I 'll put it another way . - You had hallucinations , all right ? - Yeah . And they were solid . I told you it wasn 't ordinary pneumonia . It was mutated . - I knew something would happen . - What did I hallucinate ? - Well , first of all , it was fish rain . - Fish rain ? Yeah , I dreamt that ! - It happened . - Where 's the fish ? Somebody ate them ! Then the Mayor of Warsaw spontaneously combusted . And then you hallucinated two men in the Drive Room . Apparently , one 's your confidence and the other 's your paranoia . See what I mean , Lister ? Hey ! It 's the king ! Mr Beautiful ! What 's the " H " for ? Horace ? A chair for the king , Horace . And breakfast . Mr Wonderful wishes to dine . Have you lost weight ? You look great . Is he perfect or what ? - You 're my confidence ? - That accent makes me go all wibbly ! You look like the manager of the London Jets , but sound like a quiz show host . I 'm all the things you associate with confidence , King . - And you 're my paranoia ? - Is that a urine stain ? - What ? No , it isn 't . It 's tea . - So , how are you , anyway ? Isn 't that a spot appearing on your so-called face ? My God , you 've got fat . Must be all that lager . Bet you 've got a terminal disease . Always happens to people who least expect it . Say hello , won 't you ? I 'm only trying to be friendly . Baby , baby , what can I say ? Is he the greatest guy ever or am I insane ? You 're insane . Lister , what are you going to do ? - What can I do ? - Let 's arrest them . - What for ? - For being hallucinations . Come on , smeghead . It 's company . Lister , you 're still sick . These two are symptoms of your disease . They 're the spots in measles , the swellings in mumps , the funny walk in cystitis . Until they 're gone , you won 't be better . Hey , now I know what the " H " stands for . " Hidiot " ! Am I right ? You are treading a very thin line , me laddo . The " H " stands for " Hologram " . I happen to be dead . Couldn 't happen to a more deserving guy . Come on , King . Forget those losers . Let 's go party . - No , I forbid it ! - Why ? Why do you never listen to Mr Rimmer ? He 's much more experienced , more level-headed , so much ... better than you . Listen , no one tells the Prince of Charisma what to do . Right , Prince ? - Yeah , right ! - That 's my Davey-boy ! He 's socialising with a figment of his imagination . Yes . Dust storm approaching . The ship exterior is now out of bounds . All airlocks are being automatically sealed . Estimated duration . ' 18 hours . ( OFF-KEY ) ... our love I tried to kindle like firelight , it ... dwindled Now I wonder when this ... wind 'll ever stop - You wrote that ? - Yeah , but it was ages ago . - That is the greatest love song ever . - Come on ! Ever ! It 's so deep . The images ! The dwindling , the kindling , all the indling ! I love that stuff ! When I think there 's fast-buck merchants like Beethoven and Mozart out there , grabbing the publicity , and here 's you , writing pieces of that calibre , it makes me wanna weep . - What are you doing with that butt ? - Oh , you 've embarrassed me now . It 's just that your lips have touched it . The king 's kissing lips ! I just wanted some proof that I 'd actually met the Duke of Deliciousness ! You 're serious , aren 't you ? - Serious about what ? - I 'm a nobody ! Out of 169 people aboard this ship , I ranked 169 . Bottom of the pile . That 's because you didn 't want that career stuff . You wanted your farm on Fiji with you-know-who . - If she 'd come . - Lf ? ! And turn down the opportunity of becoming the envy of all womankind ? - Oh , we 'll never know now . - Why not ? - She 's dead . - So is Rimmer . Holly can only sustain one hologram , and Rimmer 's hidden the personality disks . - So ? Find them . - I can 't . King , you can do anything . Anything ! ... anything . He can 't do anything . - Oh , I know . I 'll bet five . He used to practise kissing on his own . - How ? - He made lips out of one hand , then waggled his thumb through the gap like a tongue . That is priceless . Seventeen years old and he snogged his own hand . Once , in front of the whole school , he called his gym teacher " Daddy " . I could 've died with embarrassment . What a silly thing to do . - I hate him . - Then why talk about him so much ? Because he makes my life one big , humiliating , cringe-making , guilt-ridden hell ! Now ! Stab him ! Stab him ! Stab him ! Ah , you haven 't met Stabhim . He 's one of our skutters . Stabhim , meet Lister 's paranoia . Lister 's paranoia , this is Stabhim . Yo , Rimmer , we 've been thinking . We might get Kochanski back without turning you off . Oh , he 's drunk . I can smell it from here . If we turn off all unnecessary systems , Holly says it 'll work . Another great idea from the people who brought you beer milkshakes ! You 're obsessed with a girl you hardly know . Hardly knows her ? You haven 't heard the " indling " song ! - Our love I tried to kindle ... - Not now ! - You 're not having her disk . - Because she 'll outrank you ? But she 's a bright , good-looking , witty , upwardly mobile officer . Why should she fancy you ? - Yes , why should she fancy you ? - Yeah , why should she ? Hmm ? Sorry , I was just thinking about that song . I can 't get it out of my head . Why ? Because you 're great ! You 're an incredibly seductive , charming , charismatic young stud ! Yeah , I forgot . That 's why . You 're not having her disk or any disk . Come on , King . Where would he hide ' em ? - I don 't know . - Yes , you do . - No , he doesn 't . - Come on , think " winner " . Outside . Outside the ship . - Er , wrong , actually ! - Where outside ? Well , he 'd have to send the skutters ... Wrong , wrong ! Absolutely brimming over with wrongability . They 'd have to be under my nose , so he could laugh . Wrong and getting wronger all the time . Outside our sleeping quarters . The solar panel outside our sleeping quarters ! You followed me , you goit ! Is that where they are ? ! That 's incredible ! I did it ! ( HUMMING AND CRACKLING ) Lister ? - How long now , Hol ? - Can 't be long , Dave . Hercule has the suspects in one room , and I 'm two pages from " by the same author " . No , Holly . The dust storm . Oh , that . Any time now , it 's almost subsided . Yeah , how 's my baby boy ? You 've got a body like a coat hanger ! You make a spacesuit look like eveningwear . - Let me ask you one question ? - It 's no use arguing . I 'm going . - Who smashed up the medicomp ? - He 's stalling , King . Let 's go . Holly , give him a punch up . Why would they smash it up ? Lister , come here . Come here . You are still sick . - I feel great . - You will not ... You will not ... You will not be better until they 've gone . They know that , and they 've stopped you getting any treatment . Where 's Paranoia ? I don 't know . Is it someplace near Uruguay ? Who is this joker ? - They 're germs and they 're dangerous . - The storm has passed , Dave . - Airlocks are now released . - What are we waiting for , King ? Nothing . - Holly , put a trace on Paranoia . - What 's a trace ? - It 's space jargon . It means find him . - You made that up to be cool . - Where is he ? - Paranoia is no longer on this ship . ( CONFIDENCE ) Look at that view , Kingo ! On top of the world ! Makes you wanna dance ! ( BOTH ) Cha , cha-cha Cha-cha , cha-cha cha-cha Cha , cha-cha Cha-cha , cha-cha cha-cha ( LISTER ) Hey , here it is ! ( CONFIDENCE ) Cha-cha , cha-cha , cha-cha , cha-cha ... - Did you hear something ? - Nope . - In space , no one can hear you cha-cha ! - Could Paranoia be here ? - Forget him . - He smashed up the medical unit . - No , he didn 't . I did . - You did ? So we can be together . I did it for you ! - Where did he go , then ? - I killed him . What do you mean , you killed him ? ! Hey , he didn 't suffer . I fed him into the waste grinder and flushed his bits into space . Look , I 'm gonna go inside now . Gets a little claustrophobic in these suits . - Take your helmet off . - What ? ! - Take your helmet off . - I 'll die . There 's no oxygen ! - Hey , oxygen 's for losers . Come on ! - I need oxygen ! You don 't need anything . You 're the king ! - You 're crazy ! - Who told you you needed oxygen ? Some loser trying to make you feel small . I 'll prove it to you . I 'll take mine off first . - We 'll see who 's crazy around here ! - No ! ( WHISTLES ) - Must you do this now ? - I 'm doing my laundry ! - It 's totally disgusting . - What 's disgusting ? - Lister . - Yeah ? I just want to say I was right all along . - I said they were germs and they were . - OK . So what ? And I 'm saying that disk will bring you misery . Just remember I said that . If she comes back and she 's not interested , I can handle it . Whatever , Lister . That disk is a one-way ticket to Miseryville . I spent enough time listening to me paranoia . Now I 'm listening to me confidence . ( HUMS MILITARY TUNE ) ( JAZZ ) Hi , Krissie ... It 's not gonna work . Hello , Krissie ... That 's not gonna work either . Hey ! Yo ! Krissie ! ( PATHETICALLY ) Hi ... Lister , good luck . I mean it . - Smeg off . - No , honestly . Good luck . OK , Hol . Switch it on . - Well , he did warn you . - I certainly did . Do you honestly think I 'd put Kochanski 's disk in Kochanski 's box where any munchkin could find it ? You think you had it bad before , Lister ? Well , now you 've got it in stereo , baby . - Welcome aboard , Rimmsie . - Nice to be here , you son of a gun . It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere I 'm all alone , more or less Let me fly far away from here Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose Drinking fresh mango juice Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun

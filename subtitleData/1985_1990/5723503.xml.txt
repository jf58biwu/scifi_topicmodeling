It just happened . Allright Billy . If you 're not going to play fair ... I 'm going to eat your face . Okay , children . Back to the real world . Don 't bother packing a lunch for me . I 'm just going to eat some of this kid 's head . Oh , no . Sometimes I wonder which of the ... two is the child . He is . Let 's go partner , the stagecoach is waiting . The stagecoach needs to leave soon . No horsepower , eh ? Hey Dad . I want to go to your college today . You 're a little young to go to university . Through the window , Dad . Through the window , pal . Here is your essay . It 's all very good . Why would any kid who knows as much about the old ... west , want to write something about the zoo ? Let 's teach him how to open car doors first ... before trying more difficult things . Agreed . Give us a kiss and you got a deal . OK . See you soon . Yes Dont spend too much time playing with them guns , stranger . Goodbye Daddy ! Get down Billy ! No ! - No . Don 't go near . - Move away quickly . - Let 's go - Leave me I don 't believe it . Every single day for an entire year . Scottie ! Hey , Joe . How are you ? Well , at least democracy is saved . - Listen , let 's hit the road - The road ? Oh , Scottie . Already forgotten the Auction ? Auction . - It 's at half past four . - Of course . Why not go ahead ? I 'll get my things ... and follow . Ah , you see Scott , I thought we could ... go together and then we 'll see ... Karen and her friend and get something to eat . I can 't . I must correct some proofs . Oh , why not come with me and my chauffeur will brings you back ? Right . Let me get my jacket . I wish we could camp here . We 're like kids in a candy store . I see what I like .

Sit and please ensure that you have a number . We can not recognize bidders that do not ... have a number . Thank you . Obliously we will start the auction ... with lot number one . A knife . A special knife . This knife is like Jim Bowie 's knife . It has a large steel blade . Probably used to skin buffaloes and other ... nastier things . You can see that long ago someone bothered ... to repair this knife ... using a piece of buffalo skin . In my opinion this confirms that it is authentic . So who makes a first bid of $ 500 . Hey , stranger . A man does not dismount here unless invited . Yes , I forgot . The smell of that coffee made me ... forget my manners . Here . I 'm obliged . Where do you come from , friend ? Driving cattle to Tucson ? No need to drive them so far now . The railroad transports them since 1880 . Where are you going ? Not sure . I 'm looking for a man . A gunslinger . He has a pair of 45s with ebony handles ... and a silver star . Are you the law ? Have you seen him ? - It seems that ... - No . We haven 't seen him . You run out of coffee ? What was his name ? Whose ? What was his name ? I only remember the guns . A pair of 45s with ebony handles and stars like you said . It was in ... Crossfire . In the town of Crossfire . If you are not faster than my bullets , don 't even try . 1800 razor sold to ... number 16 . Now to batch 27 . It consists of two chests . One made of skin and the other of tin . Containing well , let 's see ... what it contains ... Old photos , old papers ... also a bottle of red eye ... empty , sorry to say . However , it contains a lot of history .

Looking for a man . He has a pair of 45s . ebony handles ... and silver stars . I 'm not the sheriff . Of course not . There 's no law in this town . It wouldn 't be healthy . We have not seen anyone here , you know . Ebony and silver stars ? A bit fancy for this town . Just like the clothing you wear Fancy . From the east , right ? Yes , I come from far away . You lie . You have very little dust . How did you get here , buddy ? I have come ... I came by train from Tucson . Lies again . There 's been no train here for more than two days . We 've seen guys like you before . From the east looking for easy money . Adventurers . Bounty Hunters . I wonder , what type would you be ? I have neither ebony or silver stars . Just plain wood . Five Points . Should be very good . I 'm the best . I believe you . That 's just words , friend . Your eyes say something else . Boys . Did you like what was in the bag ? Like the hole you 'll have in your head . Yes good . Good . No , no . The Journal wants nothing more . I can not have all these people here . Listen , I am the Mayor of this town . I have a right to be in the photo . I don 't care who you are . You can be next . Everyone can be . But I need a very clear picture . If you want to get away , finish it . All ready , Mr. Mayor . Move up please . Get away . Here we go . Well , 190 . Who 's gonna bid 200 ? Sold to Dr. Mckenzie . $ 200 , thank you . You 're welcome Well , let 's divide the spoils , my friend . Ok . I am looking for a gunman . There are many out here . Now , there are three less . Thanks to you . He has a pair of 45s with ebony handles ... and silver stars . Have you ever seen someone like that ? Silver stars ? I haven ' t . Did a military escort pass through here ? For Crossfire ? No . Is there a snake-shaped river here ? Like the old rattlesnake ? A few miles from here . In what direction ? North . Listen . This type with the silver stars , who is he ? What 's his name ? This is why I came . To find out . Listen , if you ride , you might be interested ... in a couple of horseshoes . Professor , the General awaits . Thank you , Sergeant . So this was all there was in this bag you bought ? No . There were other things . Leather straps , skins , papers , more ... This is the best there was . Well , it seems that I finally got you , Scott . I got the best of the lot . A pair of Mexican spurs . Originals , silver and brass . Recorded and sealed . Original buckles , too . Look , why do you want to enlarge these pictures ... - if only ... - Humour me . Shall we ? Okay , Scott . After I 'll show you ... - my Mexican spurs . - Can I use them ? They are antiques Scott . But also ... so are you . already found what you sought ? Can you separate and expand this man standing in the background ? Karen has a sister . Remember Karen ? The girl I go out with . has a very beautiful sister . I thought this Saturday we could ... go out the four of us . Thanks Joe . No thanks . Could we see the man better ? Scott , look , I know it has been hard for you . I know it 's true . But life has to start again . I want to focus on the handgun . Listen , thank you for what you are trying to do ... but I 'm happy as I am . I want to focus on the revolver . Of course , there it is . Listen , Scott , when we 're young we think this is the ... only reason for living . It is time to seek a psychiatrist I think I 've been had . It looks like a ... A 357 . It is exactly that . A 357 Magnum circa 1980 . No , it can 't be . It 's impossible , Scott . It 's not impossible . See the shape of the canon . And see how the cylinder looks . - Well , maybe , but ... - Maybe nothing It 's a 357 Magnum . A modern weapon . Can you make me some copies , please ? There 's something wrong here , John . I think I 've been had . If you 've been had , what about my spurs ? The photo is marked as 1886 . And I 'd say it 's authentic . No possibility of an error ? Scott , you asked me for a thorough examination . I did all the tests . Chemical evidence , spectroscopic . This photograph is at least 100 years old . There is no doubt . What is your problem ? Look at the revolver in his hands . Yes . Suppose I tell you that the pistol is a ... 357 Magnum revolver . Made in 1980 . Scott you could tell me that it is a watering can ... and I wouldn 't know the difference . But what I do know is that this picture is at least 100 years old . TIME TRAVEL ? THEORY OR POSSIBILITY Many scientists , this last century ... including Einstein , have provided us with data ... indicating that someday time ... might be manipulated . We 've explored the possibility of an advancement ... in weaponry in 1886 remaining undetected and unexploited . But we discounted that as an impossibility . I promised you that today we would have a departure . I think the way I planned it was that we would have a mystery ... in history Now , Definitely a mystery in history . Next time I give a history class . remind me not to do it in a physics building . You all have those folders before you ... containing my thesis . Are there any comments ? Any questions ? Should I interpret this as an awed silence ? OK , professor . You 're joking , right ? I mean you 've got to be joking . - No . - Time Travel ? What is this ? Like April fool 's day ? Very funny , Frank . Are there any serious questions ? Yes . Can you take me back to last Saturday night ? Please don 't . You 're going somewhere , Mr. Esterman ? Professor , with all due respect . The hour is up . It was heavy enough reading the notes ... without contnuing analysing ... I have other classes to be thinking . I would have thought you 'd be more receptive . Receptive to logic , professor . Fine , that 's it for today . Today , professor , or tomorrow ? - Or yesterday ? - Or last year ? That 's very funny . It 's a pity you get ... no notes for cynicism . A TIME TRAVELLER IN 1886 ? DR. SCOTT MCKENZIE . Perhaps I should knock . Who are you ? My name is Georgia , Georgia Crawford . How can I help you ? I have come a long way to see you , professor . I read your report , your thesis . You and I are doing research along the same lines . Don 't tell me . You gonna draw on me ? Of course not . I would like to see the phioto , please . What photo ? The one you showed the jesters in class . Why do you want to see it ? I am a person who shares your obsession ... on the old west . Your thesis fascinates me . I need to use your instincts ... to balance mine . Professor Mckenzie , I believe you . - You are from the east , right ? - What ? I know a little bit about accents . Yiou 're from the east , right ? Right , yes . Right . The east . Did you run all the tests ? Spectroscopy ... Alignment of particles . Fibre examination , all of it . A waste of time . How is that ? Well , the picture is obviously authentic . Look at the shadows . What about them ? Look . A current camera always flashes ... next to the lens . But at that time ... The held the flash on top . Which shortened the shadows . See ? Hadn 't you realised ? Of course I realised , Miss Crawford . I have this photo memorised . The shadow has obviously been shortened . Great . We think alike . You bet . Do you know where the photo was taken ? Not yet . This is our next step . Miss Crawford , do you have any idea ... how many towns in the old west ... grew and disappeared out of nowhere ? Yes , I know . But what can you tell me about the town in this photo ? Well , it was important . There was a photographer ... and also a newspaper . Which means ... that it was something more than a simple town . Very impressive , professor . No wonder you were considered ... the most important expert . Were ? Well , they 'll say that , don 't you think ? Now , these mountains should not have changed . If we could align this photo with the real mountains ... ... This is ridiculous , it could take months . Time is relative , professor . You should know that . Do you have a room where I could change ? We should make a start . - Take your pick . - Much obliged . Little Jack , Little Jack . I want to also . What do you say ? I say you won 't get anything . You say no damn thing . I said nobody was to leave camp . We 're not part of your band . You get paid to do whatever you 're told . We got to wash too , no ? What you have to do is rob a stagecoach . and we have to be ready for when it arrives . Oh , Bart. It won 't arrive until ... It will arrive when it arrives . Maybe before . And here you are playing in the river like a bunch of idiots . Out of the water , let 's go ! The Pulmari river , but known as the old rattler before , an important stop for travellers ... and famous hideout for bandits and outlaws . Why are we stopping ? Because I 'm tired . I 've been through here dozens of times ... and say it 's a waste of time . That 's all right . No need to enter defense mode . I 'm not in a defense mode . Whatever that means . All right . Suppose that we do find the town . What will it prove a hundred years after the facts . I cannot believe a great historian ... can doubt the validity of the first verifiable step . Right . What is the next town ? - Crossfire . - Ah , yes . They tried to restore this town two years ago . And I know that the only thing they accomplished ... was a failed trap for tourists . We have to see it . It won 't take long . I 'll put a little music . That 's the ashtray . People used to come here with their family . Professor , I think we have solmething . This is it . Crossfire ! Put it there , partrner . I don 't know whether you 're clever or just plain lucky . Both . Yes . It happened here in 1886 . Right . Let 's separate and see what we find . I 'll go down this end of town and you go that way . Right . I guess I should congratulate you on your determination ... TRAVEL JULY 1ST 1886 Where the hell did you come from ? I was right here , sir . You scared me . You must have indian blood or something ... to walk so silently ? I 'm looking for a man . Hell . Everyone is looking for something . This is not an information office . It 's very important to me . He is my height . Has white hair and a long white coat . Ah , yes . I saw him . He was here a while ago . Killed three men . I hope he is your friend . - Whre did he go ? - I don 't know . He asked me about thez old rattlesnake ... - river . - Much obliged , sir . What 's this for , dad ? Well , Sheriff ... In the old days ... when the bad men went into the saloon to drink ... they left their children here to dry up . Is that true , mum ? No . This is where boys fall off ... and break their heads . Very good , Sheriff . - Time for a you know what ? - Bath . - Yes . - Daddy , save me . Crawford ? Crawford ! TRACKING Hey , lady . What 's going on ? Well , I suppose that it 's time you knew . I 'm living proof that you are not crazy , professor Mckenzie . I 'm a human being of flesh and blood . With one interesting feature . I was born 600 years after you .. 600 years ? I come from 2586 . 2586 ? I 'm one of your time travellers . One of my time travellers ? How many of you are there ? TRACE MAY 15 1986 Help me to understand . In this skeptical century , I thought you would be the only one that could understand . You 've discovered part of it . It was your thesis . Yes , it was a bit naive ... - Naive ? - Good , you were a rookie . Why are you telling me this ? Professor , I came back in time to find you . Because I think you can help me . You can of course . And so I went back . - Back ? Where to ? - To 1866 . 1866 ? I 've been on a horse and rode from here ... to the river . One hundred years ago called Old Rattlesnake . And I was here . You talk about it naturally , travelling 100 years ... like someone caught in heavy traffic . Well , I expect you to be shocked . But I do wish you to get over it quick . Because I need your help . I need your mind , your books , and all the information you can find ... about this town . Our world in the future is not perfect . But we haven 't had a war in 80 years . Why are you here ? To fing Joseph Cole . And who is he ? The man in the photo . What a foolish question . You came back to find the man in my photo . You have to be dumb not to realise . Dr. Joseph Cole , a brilliant and ambitious man . And very , very dangerous . Cole is one of our greatest scientists . He is a physicist , microbiologist . He even has a degree ... in history , like you . And why is he so dangerous ? In a world of peace ? See , it 's a fine and fragile situation . An irresponsible scientist can put everything in danger . So , in my world , our scientists are monitored ... and controlled . And the creator of this control is my father ... Matthew Crawford . He works in Washington . and Cole worked with him ... and for him . Together they made the greatest discovery ... since the splitting of the atom . A machine to conquer time . That 's when it all started . Listen to me . Cole , this equipment does not belong to us . All our research belongs to the Federation . We 've reinvented the wheel . Makes you feel proud . Crawford , proud nothing . I 'm proud of the possession . Possession is an antiquated conceit . Not for me ! I have poured my blood into this . And now I hold it ... in the palm of my hand . Time ! We can return to the past and ... change things as we please . Joseph , as your friend and colleague I 'll pretend ... I did not hear this . Well I say again . You 're my partner . Do not tell me what to do . Have you finished . I don 't know , don 't know what 's happened to me . I 'm sorry . Fifteen years on a project ... and now can go no further . Maybe one day they will allow us to use it . Not while I have control of the lab . It has been so for years , Cole , you know . Since your father was here . Yes , and his father and his father 's father and his father . I know . I work for you . You 're not considering a change ? Don 't worry . Nothing has changed . Congratulations , Doctor . We should have known . To be careful . Cole was not a man to surrender easily . Yes , Mike . We just got a call from District 5 , Sir . Two blocks from the residence of Dr. Cole . What happened ? Power overload readings from that residence , sir . And it appears that the time crystal is missing . - You 're certain of that ? - Yes , sir . The investigate immediately . Mike . Cole is authorised to collect antique weapons . Be careful . And don 't go alone . Yes , sir . You stole the time crystal . And these clothes . Turn around . Sergent . And that was all . Cole escaped in time . Literally , to 1886 . And why did you come to me ? Your thesis . The one you tried to deliver to your class . - No ? - Yes . It still exists . 600 years after Saved by laser . You 're not kidding me ? No way . A dozen pages of argument about ... the possibility that a man was photographed ... carrying a Magnum in 1886 . - Wow ! - It was a very good lead . Why you and not the cops ? Strips ? Police , detectives , investigators . My father made a new time machine . We were the only ones who knew how to use it . It was top secret and training someone else was impossible . So I came . Why did Cole come back to 1886 ? Right . Why ? To change history That was what I feared . Hey Tex . We haven 't had a western movie here in a long time ... so I would take off the Wyatt Earp coat . Heading for the next village , mister ? Village ? What the hell , hop in . Do you know where I can find a vehicle ... with two seats over here ? There are many vehicles like this , friend . The one I 'm looking for is black and white . The insignia says ... Insignia ? You mean the licence plate ? Yes , the plate . Thge plate says : FSTDRAW Yes , sure . I know this car . It is very difficult to fix . It belongs to that crazy professor at the University . On central . - Central ? - Yes , central . Thanks for the lift mister . We have to assume that Cole was at Crossfire ... for a reason . What he has planned ... must have something to do with Crossfire . That 's it . So why not go back to make sure ... I 'm sure . And that was in July 1886 . The date of of the photo . Not chosen by chance . He was prepared and was dressed appropriately ... Also the blacksmith confirmed that he was in the photo . So ? There are many days . Yes , I could go back ... and sit there and wait first ... until July 31 . And what happens ... If I 'm not at the appropriate time and place ? I must discover the right date or he 'll escape . I have a friend who could help us . Texas John Cody . What he does not know is 'cause it never happened . Hey , mister . Why not move your vehicle and avoid me giving you a ticket ? Of course , I 'm sorry . Could you tell me how to get to the University ? Go down about two stop-lights , take the first left . After the second lights , turn right . After half a mile down the road , can 't miss it . Well , now comes the good part . What do you think of this , missy ? This usually hates women . That 's a risk I should take . Would you share a drop of rye with me ? - No ... - Yes , please . You yes . Right . Neat , please . Yes , neat . Cheers . Quite brassing . Yes , very brassing . Can I have another . Oh yeah . A bird can not fly with only one wing . Why don 't we go see if we can find ... something on Crossfire ? Ah , yes . Crossfire . Very good idea . Come . Lets go to my office there . Let 's see what we got . Good . Let 's see . Crossfire . There 's nothing . Try old rattler . Old rattler . SONGS Ah . Seems we strike it lucky . Know how many people could read and write ... - in those days ? - Not many . If you could write your own name , likely they made you the judge . - But they could sing . - Yes . These songs served as history books ... handed from generation to generation . And I have the best collection of songs of the west in the world . All duly recorded . Crossfire , let 's see . FOUND TWO SONGS Good . It seems that our program gives two possibilities . A. Ol ' Rattler River . B. Ballad of the Star Handled Stranger This doesn 't help us at all . It has no lyrics . You noticed ? Clever , aren 't you ? Yes . Let 's continue . Right . Said there were two possibilities . So let 's try the other . Take it easy . " ' Twas in ' 86 by the old Rattler 's curve ... " That the star handled stranger , " Showed the blue boys his nerve , " when them gun totin ' outlaws rode out of the west " up came that sweet stranger and showed them who 's best " He came out of nowhere and in a flash he was gone 'left them outlaws behind him " dead everyone ! " They 'd come out a ' shootin like bees from a hive . " but that star-handled stranger " kept the blue boys alive . " Well , I can give you a tape and a transcript , if that will help . Yes , it would help , John . These legends are told , some exagerated ... distorted with the passing years ... But I always found a basis of truth in them . - Does this help you ? - Yes , I think so . - Thanks , John . - Okay . - Thanks Cody . - Come again . We can play some cards . - Yes , if you know you 'll lose . - Yes . Where the hell did he find her ? With starry handles . Why starry ? Sometimes the star meant something special . I don 't know . Who were the blue boys ? The army . Well , the cavalry here ? What was here in 1886 if there was no war . An escort ? Escorting what ? A shipment of arms ? Gold ? Or people ? It would have to be ... someone very important to have a military escort . Like who ? The President . Who was the President at that time ? - Grover Cleveland . - Very good . I 'm a history teacher . I had a look at the documents . There was nothing mentioned . It must have been a secret mission . - Yes . - Is it possible ? Very possible . We know that nothing bad happened to the President that year . Do you think we 're going the wrong way ? I don 't know . Do you think Cole heard our song ? Possiibly . Cody left his collection to the Smithsonian when he died . Sorry . Brodsky . Joe Brodsky . Texas John knows all about the old west . But Brodsky knows everything concerning the cavalry . Great . He 's collected army relics for years . Letters , memorabilia , everything . - Why don 't we stop and call ? - Yes sir . Everything you have about the cavalry . What 's thge big deal , Scott ? Especially during the summer of 1886 . In and around Crossfire . I need it fast , Joe . All you have . But tell me . What are you up to , Scott ? It 's for a girl . A girl ? Why didn 't you say , buddy ? This is good news . I have been telling you that ... you should find a nice girl , you know . You can call me John " cupid " Brodsky . Well , she 's a little old fashioned . But you know you can 't have everything . Listen , give me a call as soon as you find something , ok ? Are you hungry ? I was before I entered here . You jnow , there are a thousand things I wanted to ask ... about how the world is 600 years in the future . The longer I 'm with you , the less I think I know . Well , if you lived in my time ... or even the time of my great grandfather ... you will have heard of Crawford . My father , Matthew , was the innovator of a social ... economic system . And I think ... Hello ! Matthew Crawford . And if Cole returned to prevent a chain of events ... which end up destroying the only man who stands in his way . My father . Presidente Cleveland had a secret advisor . A mystery man behind all his decisions . Matthew Crawford . I believe that this man was his ancestor . - and travelled in that stagecoach . - Right . Along with the President . This explains the escort . - The mystery , everything . - And if Cole kills him ? That would end of all descendants , no father , no family line , no Crawfords . to your father . No more ancestors . - And my end . - Right . We have to ascertain that date . Hello . I 'm on a search between Tucson and Darkwood . If you leave a message . I 'll call you when I get back . Thank you . Scott . I 'm calling you earlier than expected . Good . I was lucky . I found what I wanted . Cavalry around Crossfire . Look . I have a lot of material here . Several dates . You 'll have to tell me ... They are waiting Mr. Brodsky . Yes , just a moment . Well , Scott . I made some copies . Should I send them to you or will you come and pick them up ? Sir . The Senators are waiting . Gotta go , Scott . Call me , alright ? Look , look at that . 2S89 ... This is the truck we are seeking . JOE BRODSKY 47 BARROW ROAD Stop . Turn around slowly . Stop . Your pass . RESTRICTED AREA NO ADMITTANCE DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE TRAVEL MAY 15 1926 MAY 15 1986 Thank you , Sergeant . A bright light . That 's a wonderful educated guess , Lieutenant . Now look ... Anything about Crossfire ? You have ten seconds to give it to me . Where is it ? Where ? In the cupboard . My God . Alert all sections . Repeat . Alert all sections .. Gunfire on the base . Secure all exits . Alert all sections . Repeat . Alert all sections . Gunfire on the base . Secure all exits . I 'm sure he left something for me . See if you can find it . Alert all sections . Repeat . Alert all sections . Gunfire on the base . Secure all exits . Alert all sections . Repeat . Alert all sections . Gunfire on the base . Secure all exits . MOTORPOOL RESTRICTED AREA Cole . Doctor Mckenzie . Every story has an end . And you found it . But I need to do this for free . Are you alright ? I think that 's it .. It seems he made copies . Extracted from the secret report of the U.S. Cavalry . July 1886 . Orders to escort the President to Tucson in Cleveland ... to attend a secret meeting with ... The War Minister of Mexico . The troops met with thugs who attacked ... the stagecoach near the river Pulmari . Listen to this . Disaster was averted by the intervention of a stranger . Who used with deadly aim ... a revolver engraved with silver stars . Does it give a specific date in July ? But President commented that the fireworks he ... saw that day were better than the ones he had seen ... a week ago in Washington . Wait a minute . Washington ? Fireworks in July ? Independence Day . It has to be . 4th of July . And the attack occurred a week later . Four plus seven ... The 11th of July . You think so ? It 's all we 've got . We 've got to go back to July 11 , 1886 . Professor , it 's risky . Cole is a murderer . Maybe you should not go back . Lady , I must be very honest with you . There 's not much here for me . Not now , not for a long time . I feel like my entire life I 've been ... expecting this moment . I don 't know if I could go back to feeling like this . You must take me to 1886 . You can not deny me this . Come with me . Press your hand here . Here . What will I feel ? For a moment ... it feels that the entire universe is ours . 11 JULY 1886 Welcome to 1886 . Wow . Looks the same . Oh yes . Look here . - My car . - Left in the 20th century . I hope I remembered to turn the lights out . If. it was on the eleventh , it hasn 't arrived yet . The song said it came from the west . The attack took place right there . This is the perfect place for an ambush . They come right out from under the sun . Right now , they could be here , hidding . Let 's get out of here . Keep the horses quiet or I 'll quiet them forever . You sure they 're coming ? They will come . And if there is no gold ? It 's a stagecoach with escort . What the hell do you think they 're protecting , idiot . Cole must be here too . - Here comes the coach . - Get down . Woou ! Woou ! Woou ! Dismount . Get the stagecoach out of here ! Where is the stranger ? There he is ! Cole . Of course ! He eliminates the man who historically saved the day . And transforms a frustrated attack into a successful ... veritable massacre . Not if we can help it . Professor . Professor ! We cannot let him win . Professor ! Don 't do it . He 'll kill you ! Professor ! Step back , Mr. President . - Get down , Mr. President . - Watch out , Mr. President . Cover me . Crawford ! Crawford . Cole . Please stand back , Mr. President . Major , please . Dismount , sir . Draw , professor . After you , sir . Congratulations , Professor Mckenzie . You succeeded just in time . Are you alright , Mr. President ? Well , I can continue my mandate . Who is this man . I 'd like to thank him . I don 't know , sir . Major . Go get him , he deserves a medal . Yes , sir . - Major . - Yes , sir . It is best to wait a bit . - He 's very hurt , sir . - No . I 'm fine , thank you . Are you sure ? Have we met ? No . Where do you come from ? We are just making passage through the hills . I thank you . And thank you , stranger . You 're welcome . Take care of yourself , please . You too . A little higher . Left a little Just a little more . Slightly to the right . It 's perfect . They 're beautiful , aren 't they ? Yes , they are . You will have to take good care of them . For both of us . Going back east ? Yes , to the east . Take me with you . You 're not of my time . It 's against the rules . Stay here . Nor am I of your time . Sorry , I can not . Do you understand ? Yes . I suppose . Then why the long face ? Sometimes ... Sometimes in my life it seems that when ... I get used to something it goes . You 'll be allright . I 'll miss you . And I you . Promise that if any time I need your help ... I can come back and rent you a bit ? Of course . What ? I can not break the rules but ...

 [ theme music ] [ tires screeching ] [ explosion ] [ music continues ] [ tires screeching ] [ explosion ] [ music continues ] [ explosion ] [ wind howling ] [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ engine revving ] [ engine rumbling ] [ creaking ] ( T.J. ) Hey-hey . Thanks for coming , Superboy . Looks very old . Oh , it 's extremely old , Superboy . Yes , yes . But we seem to have the proverbial immovable object here . And you need an irresistible force . Precisely . Alright , everyone , please backup . [ grunting ] [ grunting continues ] [ dramatic music ] I don 't believe it . Even Superboy can 't lift it . [ Superboy grunting ] Hiya , folks . Mxyzptlk is the name . Dimension hoppin ' is the game . Superboy , I 'm so glad you could come to see me . It saves me having to come see you . [ zaps ] # I come from afar to make you a star # Okay . That does it . No more chili dogs before bedtime . Look . I know these losers are your people . And I love you , for you 're loyal to them . Really . But we got things to discuss . So what say , we make a meet on top of the biology building in say , oh , um , 28 seconds . We are dreaming , aren 't we ? Uh-uh , it 's too silly to be a dream . - It was no dream . - It 's not a hallucination . That totem was real . Now it 's gone . Well , where did he come from ? Perhaps the inscription on the totem can give us the answer . Young man , how long will it take you to have that film developed ? Uh , one hour , doc . From my lab to yours . - Get a load of us . - Absolutely amazing . Instantaneous matter transference . Seems our little friend is , uh , short on patience . Oh , what do we do now ? I 'd take the side streets if I were you . [ chuckling ] [ swooshing ] Supey baby . I 'm so glad you could make it . Uh , I gotta apologize for the surroundings . You know , it ain 't much , but we like to call it home . Looks like a rooftop to me . You hurt me , Supey . You wound me , you know that ? What ? The ventilation 's sensational , huh ? Who are you ? Oh , naughty , naughty , Supster . You 're not paying attention . My name is Mxyzptlk . M-X-Y-Z-P-T-L-K . But don 't try to say that fast . Or you 'll get your tongue wrapped around your eye teeth . I won 't be able to see what I 'm saying . Don 't ever do that . Don 't you ever , ever ... steal my line again . What do you want from me ? Where I come from , we all get a lotta yaks that you human beings , you know , messing up all the time . I 'm glad we entertain you . Really . But I 'll tell you what 's really entertaining is you know , when you 're two people like that when you 're Clark and Superboy . [ laughs ] Now , listen . Superboy , your secret 's safe with me . I wouldn 't tell anybody , you know . If the whole world knows about it , it 's a spoil . But here 's the deal . You know , in the fifth dimension we got our eye on you , you know . And you got what we want . And we always get what we want . Whoa , whoa . Back up , back up . There 's a fifth dimension ? You 're a good-looking kid . Got a lotta style . You know , but in the smart 's department you ain 't exactly world-class . You dummy ! The fifth dimension is another ... universe . There 's a parallel universe . But it 's nothing like this . What does that have to do with me ? It 's the powers . It 's the super-duper powers . You know , anybody could do magic in a fifth dimension . But that 's all like a door is magic , you know . So , we 've been watching you , you know . We 'll get you over there , you know , look you over , you know . Maybe you could show us , then we could all become super too . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm not interested . Not even a little . Please , Supey . Maybe I can change your mind . Turn on those super-duper powers and you see that lady down there ? Over there . And the building next to it . [ static ] Yay , Sup ! ( female # 1 ) Oh , Superboy . You saved my life . Ask yourself this , Supster . Can I be everywhere at once ? What if stuff like this was happening all over town ? - Is that a threat ? - That 's a prediction . Where I come from , we settle things with wagers . Uh ... are you a betting man ? - Will you get to the point ? - You know that Lana chick ? She 's not too hard on the eyes , for a human that is . The bet is , I can make her fall in love with me within 24 hours . - I loose , I cut out . - And if you win , what happens ? Yeah . If I win , you know , didn 't think of that one . I win , we go back to the fifth dimension and we , you know , make it a happening place . There 's also a third possibility here . That I stuff you right now . Huh , ah ! - I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . - Oh ! Superboy . Oh ! Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . [ birds chirping ] Hi , sweetie-honey . Ouch ! You again ? Ah ! How do you pop in and out like that ? Practice . Listen , I got a joke for you . [ panting ] Okay . - Knock knock . - Who 's there ? - Jimmy . - Jimmy who ? - Jimmy a kiss . - Ah ! Ugh ! - Great , huh ? Sensational ? - That was disgusting . Now I know what it 's like to be kissed by a toad . Ugh ! Think I need a little more work on this . ( Lana ) I don 't know . I suppose I went a little too far by calling the guy a toad . ( Clark ) For all we know , where he comes from calling him a toad is a compliment . ( Lana ) I 'll admit the guy is a little unusual . ( Clark ) A little unusual ? ( Lana ) Okay , he 's the weirdest thing to ever hit Shuster . But I don 't see what , uh ... Superboy and Dr. Royer are so concerned about ? And even if they 're right and Mr. Mxyzptlk turns out to be from out of this world he doesn 't seem all that dangerous . [ dramatic music ] Hey , where did the guards go ? You mean , where did we go ? [ gun cocking ] [ laughing ] - We need a hostage ? - We do ? - Yeah . - Yeah . We need a hostage . [ convicts chuckling ] Get the babe . Yeah , alright . Yeah , get the babe . What you gonna do , huh ? Gonna do something , eh ? Alright , somebody 's gonna get dead . I 'll save you , sweetie-honey . Don 't try to thank me , sweetie-honey . Yo . Sweetie . Ooh . [ bell donging ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ dramatic music ] Oh ! But you know it 's not my birthday . Lana , from now on , every day is your birthday . Oh , Clark . Clark ? - I just love this . - Me too . He he . - Ain 't it a trip ? - Uh-huh . ( Lana ) It 's funny . You think you know someone all your life until one day , you find yourself looking at that person in a brand new light . Yeah . Ain 't it the truth ? So , swee ... uh , Lana , let 's , uh , have some lunch . And you know , we can , uh , we can play some Putt-Putt and then we could swing by the zoo and tease the monkeys for an hour or two- - Clark Kent , I can 't decide if you 're the strangest guy I 've ever known or just the most romantic . Maybe I 'll just keep you guessing for a while . Uh , Clark . Don 't get me wrong , it 's not that I 'm complaining . Today 's been heaven . But it 's , um .. I just can 't help wondering why you 're so .. ... I don 't know , so , uh , different ? Maybe love does it to people sometimes , you know . Makes them different . - Yeah . - Maybe . That does happen sometimes . [ chuckles ] Maybe it could happen to me m-maybe it could happen to you . Maybe . [ birds chirping ] Oh ! I just don 't know how you feel anymore . All I know is ... I can 't stop thinking about you . - About us . - Now you 're talking . - That 's enough . - Superboy , um .. Hey , Supey baby , glad you could make it . Lana . - That 's not Clark . - What ? It 's not the Clark you know . You can say that again . He 's been full of surprises all day . Come with me . I need to explain something to you . I 'll take you somewhere safe . This is all so sudden . I , uh , I-I don 't know what to say . It 's okay , Lana . It 's okay , really . I understand . It 's okay . If you wanna go off with him , I understand . What girl in her right mind would wanna go off with with Clark Kent when she can go off with Superboy , y-you know ? It 's okay . I 'm-I 'm sorry , Superboy . I ... I can 't leave Clark . Not like this . The answer 's gotta be in there somewhere , professor . I have a lot of questions to which I 'm trying to find the answers . Well , there 's just one I 'm interested in . How to send that imp back to the fifth dimension ? Hey , Superboy , lighten up . That 's not like you . ( T.J. ) Granted he 's a pain in the butt . But ... what 's the big deal ? He 's no real threat , is he ? He is to Lana . Have you seen them ? He 's hitting on her and I don 't think she minds . - No way ! - Yes . Wait . How would she have time ? I mean , Clark and her have really found each other . Ha , surprise to me . Don 't underestimate Clark , okay ? He might seem laid-back on the outside , but underneath- - ( T.J. ) A seething volcano ? [ chuckles ] Look , Superboy , I love the guy , but hot lava , he ain 't . Ah . Something . Something . According to this spirit creatures appeared quite often . ( Royer ) Until the tribe shaman devised this totem to block the gate from their world to ours . Does it tell us how to get rid of them ? No . Not clearly . But these pictographs give a hint . You see , I-I 'm guessing here , I-I 'm doing a lot of guessing but ... my interpretation is that they are they are a warning and a solution . You see , these creatures can be benevolent and then suddenly turn quite vicious . With the bottom line , professor . Well , this is , I 'm-I 'm not sure . But I think it has to do with reflection and the name of the creature . That 's it ? Well , in time of course I-I hope to get more information , but .. Well .. Time 's the one thing we 're running out of , professor . Oh , yeah . [ dramatic music ] Clark . What are you doing ? Why did you turn on the lights ? Because we 're going to study . Well , you know we studied each other enough to know we 're in love . Clark . Clark ! [ indistinct ] You said you like the new Clark . I mean , that 's who I am . The way you 're acting , I 'll take the old Clark any day . No ! I want you to leave , now . I don 't wanna go . You can 't make me go . What is going on ? Get out of here , you toad . Say I love you , toad . " I love you , toad . " I wanna go back to the fifth dimension with you . " I wanna go back to the fifth dimension with you . " Morning , Supster . You don 't look too happy . [ laughs ] You know , I am though . I 'm telling you . You know why ? Because the bet 's off , I 'm not interested in you no more . - It 's all cancelled . - What 's the catch ? I 'm smitten . I like your girlfriend . [ chuckles ] Well , that 's it . She 's ready to go . She 's packed . She 's not going anywhere with you . You wanna bet your cake , Supey ? She 's going . She 's all ready to go . She 's down there packing now . You know , you can meet us at the excavation site . [ clears throat ] And , uh , don 't bring no flowers or music . Just , uh , tears for , uh , the happy couple that is going away . Mxyzptlk . Kltpzyxm . Sure hope this plan of yours works . You hope it works . Lana , um , listen , uh , Superboy filled me in . With you leaving so soon and all , I figured you wouldn 't have a chance to say goodbye to your father . What 's the deal with the note ? You 're taking Lana away from us away from everything and everyone she 's ever known . The least that we can do is have something that she can leave behind for her family and friends to remember her by . It 's the decent thing to do . Never let it be said that Mxyzptlk is indecent . Go ahead , read the note . I give you permission , sweetie-honey . " Dear Father , dear friends . " It is with great sadness and regret that I say a fond farewell and a heartfelt Kltp ... zy . Kltp .. " Let me help you with that . No . Superboy , you are through helping her . I 'll read it . " Dear Father , dear friends . " It is with great sadness and regret that I say a fond farewell and a heartfelt Kltpzyxm . " [ laughing ] That 's not fair . You tricked me . [ buzzing ] Goodbye , Mxyzptlk . And good riddance . And once Superboy figured out the secret of getting him to say his name backwards he came up with the idea of my farewell letter . And as fast as you can say Kltpzyxm no more Mr. Mxyzptlk . - Mark . - Ah , Mark . You know , Lana , you haven 't said much about my ... double . What was the other Clark like anyway ? Oh , the less said , the better . Believe me , one Clark in a girl 's life is more than enough . What does that mean ? [ instrumental music ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

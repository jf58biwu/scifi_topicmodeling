 [ Man ] I 'm afraid our star reporter is going to have to disappear- - Get this joker . ... permanently . Where does all this come from , Bryce ? The components of Carter 's mind . But he 's adding to it . [ Theora ] It 's computer-generated , whatever it is . Looks like Edison . [ Bryce ] People translated as data . - Max . - Damn it ! Two minds but with one single memory . [ emergency vehicle siren blares ] [ Man ] Open up ! [ pounding on door ] [ pounding on door ] Bruno , it 's too late . We won 't make it ! They 're here ! You 're under arrest . [ both shouting ] Get out of here ! Get your hands off ! You 've got no right- - You know that they got no right to arrest me ! - I did nothing wrong ! - [ Man ] Look at me , man ! I did nothing wrong ! You guys , help me ! Blank is- - Blank is beautiful ! Blank is- - What are you going to do with me ? What is this ? Defense data- - claimant number 000000 . - Take her down . - I know my rights . I won 't be judged by a machine . You don 't have any rights . You 're a Blank . Blank is beautiful . Blank is beautiful ! Blank is beautiful ! [ Female voice ] Good morning , Mr. Carter . This is your daybreak call . Your breakfast is preparing , and your shower is ready . Sattilac 5 is in conjunction with NetSat 7 . SkyTel 489 is in the ascendant . Aquarians , avoid eating . Sagittarians , avoid meeting people . And veg-veg-vegetarians , avoid eating meat . Or people . Heh . Heh . Heh-heh . Morning , Ed . Good morning , Max . God , you 're horribly chipper this morning . I spent the night dig-dig-digging-digging around in your old dreams . They should be arrested . And you snore . How do you know ? I 've never slept with you ! I-I turned off the all-night movie and listened- - listened . Hey- - Hey , why do you have a blanket over the screen ? - I can 't see anything . - That 's why . Hey ! The shower stopped ! See ? Smother tech-tech-tech- - technology , and it rebels . Sorry I 'm late . Security gate jammed . No one could get in . It 's chaos down there . Uh-oh . My satellite link 's gone down , folks . Can you give me a patch , somebody ? Tune up the other satellite . Mine 's gone as well . Chris , just give me backup ! Come here . Come here . [ Man ] Get Murray in here . It 's going to be one of those days . Ehh , great . Just what I need- - a delicious cup of boiling water . Why have you got ice cream-cream-cream- - ice cream on your head ? The shower cut out partway through . Now the coffeemaker 's gone nuts . That 'll teach you not to put a blanket over the television . Shouldn 't fool with technology-gy-gy-gy . If it wasn 't for fooling with technology , my buddy in a box , you wouldn 't exist . Yes , I would- - I would . [ Female Announcer ] The overnight telelection data is now loaded . If you haven 't voted , do it now . Only three more seconds to cast your vote . [ Male Announcer ] This is a result . Simon Peller is elected . Mr. Peller 's prerecorded victory speech can be seen in seven seconds on- - Come on . - Hi , Theora . - Hi . At least something 's working . I see Peller made it . - Murray want it covered ? - He 's not in yet . This place is going nuts . Look , I 'll take the Simon Peller interview . Get Martinez over here . Okay . And it is with pleasure that I accept- - Right there . Make that , uh ... heartfelt pleasure . It has a ring of deep sincerity . Fix it , would you ? Who cares , Simon ? They hit their buttons . You 're in . They 're not listening anymore . There are times , Ronald , when your cynicism is a positive joy . [ phone rings ] [ Woman 's voice ] Edison Carter from the network , Mr. Peller . Ah . Ring him through , Gabrielle . [ door buzzes ] Ah , Mr. Carter . Welcome , welcome . You know Ronald , my political manager , I think . I know his kind . Last time we met , he was working for your opponent- - very successfully , as I recall . The acerbic Mr. Carter . Very proper , very proper . Uh , fearless reporting demands directness , I 'm sure . Well ... shall we begin ? [ chatter ] I 've been stuck in the bloody elevator . Damn thing broke down . What the hell is this ? Edison went direct . - This is Edison Carter- - - This should be good . Edison hates the creep . - More than you do ? - More . I am delighted the viewing audience has selected me to represent them . This is why I so admire our computerized telelection system . It allows the people constant assessment of , uh , my performance . [ Edison ] That assumes people care enough to check , Mr. Peller . A lot of good it would do them if they did . How cynical , Mr. Carter . Our computers give us instant democracy , a constant pulse of opinion , a heartfelt feedback between the people and the , uh , networks which represent them . [ chatter ] [ Ashwell ] What shall we do , Ben ? Cheviot here . What the hell is going on ? Run a standby . There isn 't one . Everything 's dead , Murray . What ? Every computer link system we 've got is misfiring . I 'm afraid our link 's gone down . Just as well . [ Peller ] Oh , not so , Ronald . Mr. Carter is merely doing his very well-paid job . The appearance of dispute is essential to the network 's , uh , electoral democracy , eh , Mr. Carter ? May I call you Edison ? No . And I don 't like the word appearance , Mr. Peller . Very well . Some other time , then , when your equipment is working , perhaps , huh ? He 's too smart and too aggressive . And too late . If he gets out of line , Cheviot will handle him . Now , then , progress ? We have several Blanks already , but we have no idea how many more there are . I greatly enjoy neatness , Ronald . I find it very soothing . But , uh , with these Blanks running loose , uh , things are very untidy . Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk . Now , if I round them up , who knows ? This city may erect a hologram in my memory . Huh ? There 's no way to tell what 's happening . I am deeply uneasy . Uneasy ? We 're losing millions . Every network is affected . Look . Apparently , the banks have stopped transactions . Their computers are down , too . Edwards , is this a power failure ? No . That 's what 's so odd . There have been intermittent minor computer failures citywide since dawn . There 's plenty of power . It 's just not working . The way with power . Most unsettling . Ah . Simon . What is going on , Ben ? My first address is due shortly . As my sponsors , you really must get me on the air , hmm ? I wish we could . We 're going to go critical if we don 't act soon . We 're going to have riots out there . We should distribute emergency video players immediately . How are my ratings ? Our ratings . But my constituents , my votes- - 296 million of them . Simon , we all know the votes are computer-enhanced . My question is whether your opponent isn 't sabotaging your victory . Of course not . We negotiated election results weeks ago . God , what a farce . Oh , come on , Ben . You process the news as and when it suits you or us . Well , who cares ? I care . When that is done , it 's done for the public good . Well , right now , the public good , my good , and your good are the same thing . We need pic- - - Ben , do something now . - Calm down . Get me control . [ Bryce ] I call it data rescan . [ Edison ] Fantastic . Want the software ? I 'll route it to your home terminal on your optical link . Yeah . Thanks . How 'd you do this ? Well , uh , data transfer 's pretty common . They used to color old movies with it years ago . My data rescan program is just a sophistication . - They were a bit slow . - Amazing . Let me try . [ horse whinnies ] There we go . Let 's change the course of history- - the Trojan Sheep . [ laughs ] [ imitates sheep noise ] Baah . Baah . Edison . [ Bryce ] Baah . Baah . Edison . - Baah . - Baah . Baah . - Idiots . - Baah . Edison , this is urgent . Story break . Don 't forget to link it to my apartment . Baah . Picture ! Wakka wakka . [ Janie Crane ] Without regular picture transmissions , thousands are swarming the streets , desperately buying black-market tapes from video vendors . There 's another story on the streets , however . In a dawn raid , Metrocops swooped down on this building and made an arrest . So far , little is known about the detainee . I 'm going inside to find out who or what this girl was . This is Janie Crane , Network 23 , downtown . Oh , Edison . Over here . What 's the story ? It 's in here . [ Man shouts in foreign language ] [ Man ] I 've got a picture ! [ neighbors shout ] Seems normal enough . What 's the big deal ? Some girl was arrested . By the look of the place , she was leaving in a big hurry . [ Metrocop ] This new guy Peller 's ordered all the Blanks arrested . He says it 's untidy not having people on the computers . Makes them hard to catch . Edison , an off switch . She 'll get years for that . Off switches are illegal . - [ Man 's voice ] This is a message- - - [ Edison ] What 's this ? It is also an ultimatum . You have until sunset to release the detained Blanks . You have until sunset to release the detained Blanks . What the hell is this ? What on earth is it ? More to the point ... who is it ? [ Man 's voice ] This morning 's failures were tests . The reasons is the actions of Simon Peller . Release the Blanks , or every computer in the city ... Sunset ? Good Lord , who is it from ? I 'm not some damned clairvoyant , Ashwell . Peller . These people are known as Blanks , and I will not negotiate with off-the-record people . But you must consider the consequences . What are these Blanks ? People who have somehow erased or blanked their names from our central computer . They 're computer experts gone bad . Bad ? My God , they could lobotomize the network . Without televisions , this city would be ungovernable . ♪ Big-Time Television ♪ ♪ Big-Time Television ♪ ♪ 24 hours a day , day after day ♪ - ♪ Making tomorrow seem like yesterday ♪ - Go on . ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Right ♪ Reg , I 've been thinking . Very commendable , Dom . Very executive . Reg , are you trying to teach your stomach to read with that stuff ? Dom , I do believe I love you . Like a sister , I trust ? Well , I always fancied nuns . Listen , Reg . Listen . Now , if all those threats are for real , well , there 'd be no networks , would there ? No , Dom . Not if the lads do their business . We don 't have a computer , do we ? No , we don 't . Computers know too much . But they don 't know about us . So if they blow up the computers , we could be the only network working . They don 't blow things up , Dom , but you are catching on at last . Reg , what do you know about all this ? Enough . Enough to get some mates of mine out the slammer and give you and me a tasty little earner . We must be on the road . Got things to do . Whoever these people are , we must attempt to find them and find out exactly what they want . Maybe they 'll negotiate . I want you to use Carter , Murray , and have Bryce assist you with the network computer . Yes , sir . But they must assume we 'll go for them before we give up . - What do you suggest , Murray ? - Change the target . Set up an off-network base where they won 't find us if they 're looking . We could launder our mainframe here up the optical link to Edison 's apartment . Be my guests . My systems may be unreliable , though . My shower cut out this morning . I had shampoo in my hair . Aww . You don 't know what that 's like , Murray . [ Bryce laughs ] I 'm sure that was very distressing . However , we currently face the grave threat of having our screens blanked out . It 's a nightmare possibility , and we have very little time . So get started . [ coffee machine ] Coffee beans . Coffee beans . Shut up . Coffee beans . [ machine shuts off ] Coffee 's ready . Want some ? - [ Theora ] Mmm . - At the Academy , they used to say , " Caffeine kills concentration . " Which academy , Bryce ? ACS . Academy of Computer Sciences . I went in when I was 10 . 10 ? What about your family and your friends ? Oh , they were very proud , I think . No , I mean about you leaving home so young . I have no idea . I haven 't seen them . One coffee . The machine seems fine now . It went haywire this morning , along with the shower . There must have been a glitch in the domestic computer , too . [ coughing ] The domestic system . Nothing wrong with the coffee , is there ? All these malfunctions . There must be a faulty port at the control computer . It must tie into the system somewhere . Where ? [ Theora ] Let me try . Okay , if we couple Edison 's terminal back to the domestic fortressing system , we can find the weak link . Now , there was a weak link in Edison 's local subframe , right ? I might be able to penetrate the mainframe through . Aha . Ah . You 're good . Okay , it 's tracing back to here . Downtown ? [ Bryce ] If they can access the Domestics mainframe , they can control everything . That computer runs the city . [ Man 's voice ] The downtown mainframe is breached . Our overload program is connected . Our ultimatum has been transmitted . Our ability to interrupt television has been demonstrated . Our friend Blank Reg , will set up triggers , a solo trigger , and then ... we simply wait for our calm and patient friend . Since pictures have returned , we are able to confirm two more Blank arrests , despite the sunset ultimatum . Simon Peller continues his relentless campaign- - That bloody clown Peller is still arresting people . - ... perhaps ripping a tear- - - [ phone rings ] ... in the very fabric of our society as we know it . Edison , that bloody clown Peller is still arresting people . Yeah , I heard . Uh , can 't Cheviot do something ? I mean , he 's almost network property . Peller 's up there with Cheviot now- - Very hush-hush . Even the securicams are cut . How are we doing ? What I wouldn 't give to be a fly on that boardroom wall . Well , you can if you like . What ? [ fly buzzing ] [ Cheviot ] ... got to stop this now . [ Peller ] If I stop now , they 'll think they 've won . If you don 't stop now , they will have won . [ fly continues buzzing ] Bryce , what is this ? Oh , it 's a bug . Well , a fly , actually . It was my graduation project when I was 11 . A mechanical fly ? [ Theora ] Bryce , that 's brilliant . ... anarchists make disorder . It 's pretty good once I 've rewritten the basic aerodynamics . [ buzzing ] [ Edison ] How amusing . ... will turn on the networks , authorities , everything . Until you attacked them , they were harmless as a fly . Simon , you 're risking my network . Oh , my fly . I 'm sorry , Bryce , but that was pretty funny . That took ages to perfect . Take a look at this . I 'm at the source , but there 's a sort of gate . - [ Edison ] What is it ? - [ Bryce ] I don 't know . Try another route . Great . We 're stuck . No , we 're not . We can get invited in . How ? Bryce gave it to me . His new toy- - data rescan . No . No , Edison , that 's not a security breaker . That 's a , uh , data transfer system . Yeah , but , Bryce , you remember the Trojan Horse . The city of Troy had to take it in because they couldn 't resist it . So ? So we 'll give them a Trojan Horse- - something so ... unique for a computer hacker , they 'll have to take it in . We 'll give them Max . I hope you 're wearing something under there , Dom . Is it absolutely necessary to come up here ? It 's barbaric . You really are a trial , Reg . Take a look down there , princess . It 's also the best vantage point there is . You can see the sun go up there and down over there . Oh , that 's wonderful , Reg . So what ? So ... little cactus , when I 've lined the dish up , we can put Big-Time on air over the whole city , while doing Blank Bruno a favor . [ Max ] I want to get this clear . You want me to pretend-pretend-pretend to be a horse ? I saddle up for no man ! Max , it 's our only chance . If they , whoever they are , will open up that gate , we can get in . And you are irresistible . Well , yeah , but- - Whoev-Whoev-Whoev- - Whoever they are ? What I want to know is what happened to the Trojan Horse-se-se ? Well , it became a great mythical figure . Yeah , but did they pick up- - pick up- - pick up- - did they pick up the option on its series ? Please , Max , we need to find out who the threat is coming from and why . [ muttering ] Okay . Right . Right . Just put me down for get-get-getting out again . That 's no problem . We 'll just keep the lines open so we can bring you out any time we want . Now , feed the data out once you 're in there , and we 'll run you back to 23 's mainframe if they don 't take the bait . Bai-Bai-Bai-Bait ? Bait ? Be my guest . Delicately , Bryce . Good luck , Max . [ Edison ] What 's that ? That 's Max . That 's him . That 's how the computer sees him . [ keyboarding ] Now we 'll send him on his way . Adios . [ Female voice ] Bruno . What is it ? Extraneous matrix about to enter . Don 't cr-cr-crease the lapel-pel-pels ! It is dormant . Show me . Elegant . Recheck uplink feedback . None . It is a self-contained ROM construct . Shall we check for sections ? Hmm . [ Bryce ] They 've seen him . They 're running a neuronal through him . [ Theora ] Are we clean ? Sanitized . There 's no way they can trace him back to us . Oh , this is beautiful . What is it ? It is passive but alert . Well , God , what do you think ? - Shall we let it in ? - [ croaking ] They 're looking at him . Hang in there , Max . We 'll take it into the volatile RAM . If it 's non-hostile , I 'll transfer it to a mainframe siding . The RAM is linked . On command , flatline all access links . Isolate that thing from its source . - Come on . - Hang in there , Max . Run a trace . We need that feed . Quick . Flatlined us . What 's that mean ? It means they know we 're there , and they 've locked us out . Run the construct . Anyb-Anyb- - Anybody home ? Is this a prerecording ? No . It has full responsive capacity and artificial intelligence capabilities . Less of the artific-fic-ficial- - artificial , voice box- - box- - box . Anyway , where am I ? I am Bruno . I 'm a Blank . I am Max . Max Head-Head-Head-Head-Headroom . Max Headroom . [ croaking ] Ribbit . Ribbit . [ Edison ] Can 't we do something ? Max is trapped in there . We had to run his construct complete . They would have sensed a duplicate . I 'm afraid he 's stuck in there . [ Edwards ] Chaos out there . People are in a panic , fighting for old video recordings . Personally , I 'd rather watch a smoke alarm . Ben , Peller must do something . We may not survive this . They mean business . He won 't move . He 's adamant . No deals . I know . Let 's fire somebody . Edwards , are all networks out again ? Complete void . They 've crashed all the transmission programs again . If Peller doesn 't move , we 're dead . So ... I knock the trigger towards the sun . Open a bit . Come on . Lock the old device into the sun . [ Woman 's voice ] Solar trigger locked . Sun 's declination now 55 degrees . Trigger now automatically tracking the sun . Bruno , Blank Reg here . It 's all set and running . [ Bruno ] I have the trigger hot and clear . Thank you , Blank Reg . Declination now 50 degrees .

I was in a bit of bother- - tax creds , the law , slight violence , all that . I had to disappear officially . They did me a favor . Suddenly I didn 't exist . I was a blank file . Still am . So , uh ... now it 's a kind of a philosophy , eh ? Yeah , sort of . Well , everything 's bleeding rules , isn 't it ? They even want a license for the dog . Imagine . He 's only eat it , you see . Who 's running that bomb threat , Reg ? Oh , come on ! You can 't ask me that . Simon Peller is a fool . You Blanks may be right . But you 're fooling with millions of ordinary people here .

Naturally , we gave our word , Mr. Carter , but no one will be harmed . There 's simply a massive electronic hemorrhage . The sunrise industry meeting its sunset . Give us our screens . Give me the chance to do my story . if I have those screens , I might be able to do something . Very well . But it will simply make the inevitable end more public . And time is short . He 's right .

Simon Peller . At dawn this morning , our city was hit by a series of critical computer failures . until minutes ago , our screens were blank . These were not accidents . The people who caused these failures are not terrorists . They claim that some of them have been wrongfully imprisoned . Just moments ago , I had an opportunity to speak with their leader . If I can persuade Simon Peller , will you stop this thing ? Declination now 0 degrees . Why has the dump program not run ? Trigger enabled . There must be a fault in the solar trigger . It doesn 't matter . I rigged a demolition charge . If the trigger fails , it 'll blow it to bits . Same result . You did what ? Stay on . Stay on ! Blank Reg might be near that thing . But if the program doesn 't run , we all lose . It 's not worth Reg 's life , Traker . Damn your arrogance . I 'm flatlining the program . I cannot risk Reg 's life . No . Yes . Only one man can prevent our city being paralyzed- - Simon Peller . Mr. Peller , are you prepared to negotiate to prevent this catastrophe ? Microlink running Control . My dear Miss Jones , of course I will release these people . I have no intention of risking this city or its television network . I never said that ! Carter has done it . Stand by , opinion templates . Pictures surely can 't lie , Mr. Peller . let 's see what the public thinks of your very sensible decision . Public seems to approve your decision by a huge majority . Will you order the release now ? Uh- - I hereby order the release of all the Blank detainees . [ cheering ] It 's all over . That was gross misrepresentation . The people wanted a solution . I gave them one . I just pretended it was yours . Those Blanks will be brought to justice . They haven 't heard the end of this , Carter . Oh , I think they have , Simon . Unlike the Fringes , justice here is a lot more than cash flow or politics . I believe you two can find your own way out . Hmm ? What are you laugh-laugh-laughing about ? Bryce just tried to kiss me- - kiss me . Well , you are irresistible . Well , thank you . - Blank Reg . - Huh ? Come on . The camera . Reg , what are you doing fooling about up there ? Being heroic , Dom . It was my turn . Hey ! Th-Th-Th-This is funny . Ha !

 In the early 2030 's , mankind discovered a new substance , Texmexium , which enabled the entire world to be controlled by a new generation of supercomputers . Because of the danger for its misuse , supplies of Texmexium were kept under heavy guard at the hyper-nuclear facilities that power every major city . At the same time , Mankind 's continued depletion of Earth 's natural resources has resulted in a scarcity of the materials necessary to build the all-powerful computers . Conductive plastics and computer chips are more valuable than gold and a new breed of treasure hunter has evolved to fill the demand . Seeking machine parts lost or discarded by earlier generations , these soldiers of fortune will brave any danger in their quest for chips . Even the forbidden zones . Hey , don 't vomit . If you do , I 'll make you eat every bit of it . Now for a loop-the-loop , so get ready ! What the hell 's Brooklyn doing at the controls ? He throws up every time he grabs the joystick ! He 's a mechanic , not a pilot ! I 've heard it before , Bebe . But it 's time he and Mary-Ann got acquainted . I told you to take your hands off your weapon . I 'm not on a suicide mission with Brooklyn . We land in five minutes . That 's government bullshit . Hope you 're right , man . Looks like a real hullabaloo . What 's this , another war ? Bad things happen when you fool with a gun . Hey , listen to this ! I bet we 'll be buried in money by this time tomorrow ! What 's Kyron 5 's level ? What 's this line for ? We go in , we get the chips . And that 's it . We go in , we get the chips , and we get out . That 's what Bancho said . Hear that ? Just now ? A strange sound ? Look , it 's burning ! What worries me is what took ' em down . Let 's go to Borneo . It 's still hot . What 's wrong ? Listen , let 's go to Borneo . Enough of that , Bombay . Take it off . Enough of that , Bombay . Take it off . Robocola , Pepsi type . Made on lsland 8JO , 2023 . How nostalgic . You know , I was thinking . We can move it better than some lousy chips . What ? A Gunhed . Too heavy . I told you we only came to get the Kyron chips , and I told you to stop playing with that , didn 't I ? Bad things do happen when you fool with a gun . All right ! Brooklyn , let 's go ! Your routine , Brooklyn . Rangers . We 're treasure hunters . Maybe we want to know why you 're here . I only wish you were right about that . Electric barrier ? We can 't go back ? ! And you buzz all the way out here ? Kind of a long hop . This isn 't Texas anymore . We want this Biodroid as badly as you ! It 's not very wise to make a ranger angry . We 're gonna get the chips with Bombay . You cover us while we go ahead . What if she wakes up ? I 'm picking up something . Moving right for you . I know . A sound activated mine 's drifting in the air . Cut all voice communication . All sensors on mute . It really is . A series nine R two , 201 0 . It 's ancient . It won 't explode . Where 's Bombay ? This can 't be happening . We gotta save Bombay ! She 's right . Like you said , we 're bandits . Bebe ! Bebe ! Bebe ! Is that all you care about ? My partners died for this . I won 't give it up for anything ! What 're you doing ? My leg ! It hurts ! All of a sudden , the Biodroids launched an attack against human beings . One of them stole the vial and returned here , as if programmed to do so . Bad break for us treasure hunters . Bancho , if he was alive , would 've said , " Forget the chips , go get the vial . " Where the hell is Nim ? Who are you ? I 'm the one who saved you . Then why were you hiding ? You looked weird . Screaming and weeping ... I was with someone else . Where is she ? You two wanna get off this island ? It 's no use . What about the ocean ? Just try . That 's Eleven . I 'm Seven . Eleven lost her voice . Who are they ? What kind of place is this ? A plan might help . Use these kids ? No , don 't . Eleven will take you to Kyron . This is dangerous . This isn 't child 's play . Where did you get this ? It 's garbage from the Robot War . Show me where ! Run ! Because you saved their asses , this place is too dangerous now ! My seat . I 'm a mechanic . I don 't drive . Saving my butt ? ! You ... saved my butt ? ! Adults ... Always trouble . The only way back to Mary-Ann is through Kyron Dome . Nim 's plan is to take this truck first , then walk , climb and crawl . According to Eleven , it 's at least twenty hours to Kyron . Brooklyn ! Brooklyn ! It 's a nickname . I don 't know what it means . Bancho called me that . Where are we ? Gunhed parts . Everywhere . It started yesterday . You brought that strange , eerie sound with you . We need a Gunhed in order to get that monster robot . Manipulate a finger a certain way , and it will activate the energy matrix . The processor 's dog meat . But the core 's in good shape . I can convert it to a manned machine . What we need is a pilot . Gimme the vial , Nim . A chemical accident . Don 't you wanna find out what Kyron 's up to ? Seven , show the vial to the camera eye . The new and ultimate energy form . I graduated from Beverly Hills High School . The countdown ? At the Kyron Dome ? Brooklyn ! Brooklyn ! Nim ! Nim ! If we get to work on this Gunhed here , we can get to Kyron again . We need this Gunhed . And a pilot . Me ? You must be kidding . I 'm a mechanic . I get carsick in a cockpit . That 's how I lost everything . Air Force ... My job ... If Bancho hadn 't picked me up ... Goodbye " Hero " Not a chance . What 'd you expect to find ? Ah , a Balkan gun . What else ? A weapon rack . With a six-barreled missile launcher ... Why did you come back ? Nim told you to ? You 'd get your butt blown off without me . First , the vial . Then the keyword . And Kyron 5 will have total control of the planet . As long as we have the vial , Kyron 5 won 't wake up . But I don 't like the way the Biodroid died in the pool . What were the shining worms that pierced Bebe ? Found them ? Bebe ? Bebe ! Nim ! Can you hear me ? Answer me , Nim . Nim ! Please ... Nim ! Nim , can you hear me ? Nim ! Nim , can you hear me ? Nim ! Shut up and listen . The Biodroid has regenerated . It 's after the vial . The Gunhed got hit too . The energy matrix is dead . What 's this ? For God 's sake , what is this ? Anyway , I 'll see you at Kyron Dome in twenty hours . The Gunhed will be there too . Fuel tank , fuel tank , fuel tank for air-conditioning . Seven , put this in the fuel tank , would you ? Seven ? Hey , be careful with it , Seven . Where 's Nim ? What happened to the two of them ? That 's enough . Let 's party , Gunhed ... We 'll fill you up on the road . Who 's the boss here , anyway ? Forward ... We 've got the weapon rack on . Your time 's up , Seven . Explode the sidewalls . Give me thirty seconds after the explosion . Let 's go , Gunhed . Seven , you promised . Get back to the truck . Activate the environmental sensor . Optical scope " On " . Number 1 , check . Number 2 , check . Radiation sensor check ! Infrared sensor check ! Rear weapon rack in number one position . Gather up your courage . Slow and easy . Forward . What is this ? Get down ! Down ! Down ! Down ! Don 't embarrass me ! All right , forward ... Warm up the chain gun . We 'll see if it works . Ready to fire ! Do something about the noise ! Activate the grappling gun . What 's that sound ? I don 't like surprises ! Check the cooling system ! Please , Gunhed . Move your butt , will you ? Good . Don 't fall , don 't fall . Huh ? Optical ? What 's that ? Can 't you make it simpler ? No sweat , buddy . Seven ? Sorry ! Where the hell are you ? ! By the booster . Get up here , on the double ! I can 't . Help him , Gunhed . Can 't you turn your leg or something ? You 're a man , Seven . Try it ! Even a woman couldn 't do it ! In forty seconds I have to fire the booster . Go ahead , I 'm prepared to die . Stop the sequence . Fifty-five tons doesn 't sound so bad . Fire the booster ! The " NOSE " is coming down . I got it ! Hurry up and fire ! Fire ! Don 't play with the bomb , Seven . I connected the cable , Gunhed . Any reaction ? Yeah , I 'm counting on you . Enemy sensors think Gunhed 's getting the data down there . If we could only fool the vibration sensitive one ... I know . I 'll confuse them with these bombs . Ten minutes will be enough . After that ... I 'll do what I like . We 'll get off this island together . Maybe I don 't want to leave . Maybe I like it here . Bad things can happen when you fool with a gun . Brooklyn , we 've hidden some food and water . If it 's marked " Seven , " it 's safe . " Eleven " is dangerous . I have to cut the voice communication . Anything else ? Don 't die . Yeah , I won 't die . Got the data ? Any info about Nim and Eleven ? Such a sensitive answer ! Show me level 260 . Seven 's gonna save ten minutes for us . Be aggressive . Blow up A-3 . What 's this ? So , we take a ride . If they detect us , right ? How far can we get in ten minutes ? Well , then , Gunhed , my dear ... Let 's try tank mode , shall we ? This is a bad joke . In fact , this is a moving coffin . Oil canal ? You didn 't say you could swim . You could 've asked for my opinion about this . We 're not waterproof . I 'm talking about discipline , numb-nuts . We 'll get off at 385 and get the coolant . So , now what ? Then let 's get off at 381 . So ... then ... what ? Brooklyn ! Brooklyn ! How long have I got ? Why is it getting so hot in here ? We 're trapped inside the reactor . Thanks for letting me know . I 'm going out ! Do it quickly , Gunhed ! I 'm coming out . Hurry up , Gunhed ! Quicker ! Faster ! Can 't you make it move faster ? Tell me exactly what 's gonna happen . What 'll happen if they find us ? Cheer up , everybody . You too , " NOSE " . You 're surrounded . Come out with your hands up . Can 't make it ! We 're out of fuel . This is the last gas station . The upper floors are death valley . I 'm not playing . Just getting ready to go it alone from here . In those vessels ? Those whiskey barrels ? Robots and whiskey , huh ? So long . I gotta go it alone . What 're you talking about ? You serious ? About the whiskey ? What 's the ammo situation ? Doesn 't give us much time . And your armor 's in lousy shape . She scared me to death . That 's why ... What if we draw the Aerobot 's attention ? The Biodroid ? Can Nim handle it alone ? You related to somebody named Bancho , by any chance ? Just checking . Show them just how good we really are . You got it , buddy . Gunhed , standing mode ! I knew you 'd say that . Don 't booze up , Gunhed . Who 's sending this ? Come on , straight ahead . I 'm here . Come over here . That 's right . What the hell is that code ? C 'mon , tell me , Gunhed . Yeah , big boy , come on ! Geronimo ! Bebe ! Bebe ! Where 's Seven ? Seven ! I kept my promise . Where 's Gunhed ? He died ? What 'll happen to Gunhed ? Look ! A message from Gunhed ! He 's alive !

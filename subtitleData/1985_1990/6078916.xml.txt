 Come on , that 's enough . ( Laughs ) So when do I get to see you again ? The next time I 'm hungry for some bad sex . ( Phone ) Hello . ( Man , whispering ) I 'm watching you . - Who is this ? - Charlie . Call me Charlie . I 'm watching you . I 'm always watching you . This is for you . ( Gasps ) ( Man ) Oh , boy . A little much , huh ? Yeah , she has this tendency to overact . - Can 't you get any better out of her ? - You 're very funny , Paul , considering I didn 't want her in the first place . - I thought she had something . - Yeah , nice little titties . Little titties ? Maybe I shouldn 't have hired a first-time director . Paul , don 't you give me that . I 'm working miracles with this stuff . That 's what you say , Alex , but I 'm looking at footage and I 'm seeing a lot of artsy-fartsy crap . Damn it , Alex , I quit my law practice . I put my own money into this thing . I want it commercial . Paul , please , I 'm killing myself for this movie . It 's gonna be great , I promise you . Hey ! I don 't want " great " ! Just give me a movie that is gonna make some money . You know what happens to first-time directors who bring in a flop , don 't you ? - What ? We get disembowelled ? - Worse . You never get to work again . Never ever . What about the last scene ? - The whole picture is riding on it . - I know . - Can she make the transition ? - Well , I have to work with her . Pay close attention , Alex . If the last scene doesn 't work , if she can 't pull it off ... then the whole picture goes down the toilet . Paul , I know what I 'm doing . I started out as an actor , you remember ? Yeah . Let 's just hope you 're a better director than you were an actor . Are you ? ( Sighs ) Making movies can be a little like magic . Manufacturing illusions and manipulating the way people feel . But when you fool around with what is and what isn 't you run the risk of being tricked by your own sleight of hand . - I thought you cared about me . - I do . You 've lied to me all along . Put down the knife . I trusted you . I loved you . Wait ! - What are you feeling right now ? - Angry . OK , good . What else ? - Hurt . - Good . Let 's try it again . Put down the knife . I trusted you . I loved you . I loved you . No . No ! This is Amateur Night , she 's not relating to me ! - Duncan ... - Don 't " Duncan " me ! Enough ! I 'm not gonna have her make me look bad in the last scene ! - Shut up . I 'm warning you . - I don 't give a shit ! Look , I 'm sorry , I know you 're inexperienced ... - You are out of line ! - No , it 's OK , let him talk . Talk . Look , in this business , you only get one shot . And this last scene could be really hot but not with you making me look like a clown ! I 've been trying . ( Sighs ) Shit . I know that . Are you finished ? Get out . We 'll finish rehearsals without you . - What , are you kidding ? - Do I look like I 'm kidding ? Exit your last hope . ( Actress ) I 'm sorry . You have nothing to be sorry about . Come on , we 'll rehearse in my office . That 's a wrap , everyone . ( Man ) Hey , bring those cameras over here . ( Man ) No , she 's fucking it up ! You have to do something . - I know , but what the hell can I do ? - Couldn 't we just set her up so ... I trusted you . - You can still trust me . - No . No , I can 't . - I thought you cared about me . - I do . You 've lied to me all along . Put down that knife . I trusted you . Loved you . You really like me , don 't you ? That line is not in the script . Maybe it should be . The knife . You kill him while he kisses you . That 's so sad . Well , love kills . That 's what this film is about . Say it . Love kills . Good . Put down that knife . I trusted you . I loved you . Alex ? Was I OK ? - ( Sighs ) - ( Giggles ) I 've gotta go back to the editing room . - Would you like to meet for dinner later ? - I 'd love to . - Skyline Lounge at nine o 'clock ? - OK . OK . All right . - ( Knock at door ) - Alex ? I thought we were gonna meet at the restaurant . Flowers ? What is this ? Who are you ? Wait ! Ah ! Hey , take it easy . - Trying to scare me to death ? - Sorry . I just wanted to ... you know ... How did rehearsal go ? Fine . Last scene 's a beauty , Leda . Do it right and you 'll be hot stuff over in Lotus Land . You think scaring me is gonna help my acting ? By the way , I don 't like roses . They make me sneeze . ( Tyres squeal ) ( Gasps ) ( Piano plays ) I 'm sorry , I got hung up . - Why are you late ? - I got stuck in the editing room . Paul is going crazy . Don 't give me that , Alex . This isn 't funny . You 're late because you had to get rid of the motorcycle and ditch the mask . What ? I thought it was Duncan . Delivered the flowers then following me . Now I see it 's you . You 're trying to spook me , mess my head around for the last scene . Leda , what the hell are you talking about ? You think I 'm an awful actress , that I can 't do the last scene right so you 're making me think there 's a real Charlie after me . A real Charlie ? Miss Bedell ? - Miss Leda Bedell ? - Here . Phone call for you . - Hello ? - ( Man , whispering ) I 'm watching you . - What ? - Watching you ... Who are you ? Call me Charlie . Hey , listen , you creep ... ( Dialling tone ) Nothing . ( Chuckles ) - The bathroom ? - The bathroom . ( Gasps ) ( Chuckles ) - ( Laughs ) - Here 's Charlie . ( Both laugh ) ( Gasps ) ( Cries out ) No . No . No . No . No . This is a dream . No ! No , please . Oh , my God . ( Screams ) No ! ( Phone ) Alex . - ( Heavy breathing ) - Alex ? Charlie . Call me Charlie . I 'm watching you . Always watching you . I 'm going to cut you . I 'm gonna cut your pretty skin . You sure it 's here ? Excuse me , sir , but we 've received a complaint . - Complaint ? - Mind if we come in ? ( Opera plays ) - Are you alone , sir ? - Yes , alone . Tessie died two years ago . - You 're sure this is the room ? - Yeah . This is the room . You look ill . You look ill , little girl . Maybe you were dreaming . ( Laughs ) - You all right now ? - I guess . Take care , you hear ? ( Screams ) Ahh ! No ! No ! ( Gasps ) ( Screams ) No ! No ! Ah ! Ah ! ( Screams ) No ! No ! Ah ! No ! No ! No ! - No ! - Cut ! Good . Good . Good . Good . Leda , that was wonderful . - l 'm so tired . - l know , I know . Just one more scene to go . - ( Sighs ) The last scene . - Yeah . You 're ready for it , aren 't you , little girl ? What did you call me ? I ... I was just ... What did you call me ? I said what did you call me ? Hey ! Leda ! Hey ! What ... What the hell is going on ? - Not now , Paul . - Yes , now , damn it ! Now ! ( Breathing heavily ) The old man . Leda ? Leda ? I hold you totally responsible for this , Alex . You 'd better find her , and fast . - Where the hell is that girl ? - What are we gonna do ? How can we shoot this last scene without her ? - Let me think . - The clock is running . There is no money for a delay . Don 't you understand ? - lf we don 't shoot it now , it 's all over ! - l know that , Paul . So why don 't you shut up for a minute and let me think ? Should 've had my head examined , getting into this bloody business with you ... Shut up , you goddamn moron ! I 'm so sick of your bitching . You better have her on set , on time or I 'll sue your ass for every cent l 've sunk in this . - Out ! Out ! - l 'm just the guy that 'll do it ! Out ! Out ! ( Door shuts ) Damn . ( Phone ) - Leda ? - ( Heavy breathing ) - Hello ? - ( Leda , whispering ) I 'm watching you . Always watching . Oh , Leda , no . - Call me Charlie ... - Leda , we have to talk . - Talk about the last scene ? - Yes . Read the script , Alex . Let 's do the last scene for real . ( Tyres screech ) ( Electronic beat ) ( Electronic music ) Leda . It was you . - Why ? - Why ? I did it for you , Leda , so you could really do that last scene . Don 't you see everything depended on it ? The movie , your career . What about the restaurant , the telephone call , the old man ? The phone call was easy . I recorded Charlie 's lines on my computer and hooked it up to a timer . It called the restaurant right on time . It was voice-activated . The old man . That was me , too . I used to be an actor , you remember ? I trusted you . You can still trust me . No ... No , I can 't . - l thought you cared about me . - l do . You 've lied to me all along . Put down the knife . Put down the knife . I trusted you . I loved you . ( Cries out ) Ah ! Ah ! ( Alex ) Leda , Leda , what did you ... - Ah ! - ( Laughs ) ( Laughter ) ( Stammers ) ( Laughs ) Yeah. lt 's not real. lt 's a joke . It 's a joke , it 's a joke . Alex ... was I OK ? And you thought I couldn 't act . ( Hitchhiker ) Alex Nolan directed movies . He bent the light and the shadows , and called it truth . He used people like creatures of clay . But the truth , when it 's bent , has a way of snapping back . And the creatures created , well , they often have the last laugh . Subs : Clyde.w.o.b

 [ Electronic Beep ] [ Beeping ] [ Thud ] [ Respirator Hissing ] [ Man ] Bio readouts are all in the green . Looks like she 's alive . Well , there goes our salvage , guys . How are we today ? Ohh . Terrible . Well , better than yesterday , at least . Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station . Been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're okay . Oh , looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy . Come here . Hey , come here . How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ? Where have you been ? Guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Burke . Carter Burke . I work for the company , but don 't let that fool you . I 'm really an okay guy . I 'm glad to see you 're feeling a little better . They tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon . That 's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep , or something like that . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? [ Woman On P.A. ] Inhalation Therapy , report to - Has no one discussed this with you yet ? No . But , I mean ... I don 't ... recognize this place . No , I know . Uh - Okay . It 's just that , uh , this might be a shock to you . It 's long - How long ? Please . 57 years . What ? That 's the thing . You were out there for 57 years . What happened was you had drifted right through the core systems . And it 's really just blind luck ... that a deep-salvage team found you when they did . It 's one in a thousand , really . I think you 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . [ Stammering ] You - You okay ? - [ Hisses ] - Uhh - [ Heart Pounding ] - [ Hisses ] - Uuh ! You okay ? [ Groaning ] - [ Hisses ] - Oh-h-h ! Oh , God ! Nurse ! Please ! God ! Someone get in here now ! [ Screaming ] Now ! - Hold ! - Please . Hold on ! Kill me ! No ! [ Gasping ] Uh ! Bad dreams again ? You want something to help you sleep ? No . [ Sighs ] I 've slept enough . Jonesy . Come here . [ Meows ] Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right now . [ Purring ] It 's over . [ Birds Chirping ] [ Chirping Stops ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr Hirsch , 334 . Dr. Hirsch , 334 . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . I 've been running behind all morning . Is there any word about my daughter ? Uh ... I really think we should worry about the hearing now . 'Cause we don 't have a lot of time , okay ? I read your deposition , and it 's great . If you just stick to that , I think we 'll be fine . The thing to remember is , there 're gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there . You 've got feds and Interstellar Commerce Commission , Colonial Administration , insurance company guys - Do you have any news about my daughter ? Well , we did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest . Um - " Amanda Ripley-McClaren " - married name , I guess - " Age 66 . " And that was at the time of her death , which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy . She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository , Little Chute , Wisconsin . No children . I checked . [ Briefcase Closes ] [ Inhales Sharply ] I promised her ... that I 'd be home for her birthday . Her 11th birthday . [ Choking Up ] [ Sobbing ] [ Man # 1 ] I 'djust like to go , uh - back to this point about the override destruct order . [ Man # 2 ] Is it in the file ? I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . Now , how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please ? Now , you freely admit to detonating the engines of , and thereby destroying , an M-class starsreighter , a rather expensive piece of hardware . Forty-two million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account , in that , for reasons unknown , the Nostromo set down on LV-426 , an unsurveyed planet at that time , that it resumed its course ... and was subsequently set for self-destruct by you for reasons unknown . Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down there on company orders to get this thing , which destroyed my crew ... and your expensive ship . The analysis team , which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter , found no physical evidence of the creature you describe . Good ! That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock , like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did I.Q. ' s just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft . It was an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once ... in over 300 surveyed worlds . - " A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " - Yes . These are your words . " And has concentrated acid for blood . " That 's right . Look . I can see where this is going , but I 'm telling you that those things exist . - Thank you , Officer Ripley . That will be all . - Please . You 're not listening to me . Kane , the crew member - Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs there . Thousands . Thank you . That will be all . Goddamn it , that 's not all ! Because if one of those things gets down here , then that will be all ! Then all of this - this bullshit that you think is so important - You can just kiss all of that good-bye ! It is the finding of this court of inquiry that ... Warrant Officer E. Ripley , NOC14472 , has acted with questionable judgment ... and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . Now , no criminal charges will be filed against you at this time , and you are released on your own recognizance ... for a six-month period ofpsychometric probation , to include monthly review by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . That could have been better . Look , I think the - Ripley ? Van Leuwen . Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . There have been people there for over 20 years , and they never complained about any hostile organism . What do you mean ? What people ? Terraformers . Planet engineers . They go in , set up these big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a " Shake ' N Bake " colony . How many are there ? How many colonists ? I don 't know - 60 , maybe 70 families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . [ Wind Howling ] [ Horn Honking ] [ Low Chattering ] [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] [ Machines Clacking ] I 'll be down in maintenance , okay ? Al ! What ? Hey , Al . What ? Remember you sent some wildcatters ... out to the middle of nowhere last week , out past the Ilium Range ? - Yeah , what ? - One of them 's on the horn , a mom-and-pop survey team . He says he 's onto something . He wants to know if his claim will be honored . Why wouldn 't his claim be honored ? Well , because you sent them to that particular middle-of-nowhere on company orders , maybe . I don 't know . Christ ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth ... says , " Go look at a grid reference . " We look . They don 't say why , and I don 't ask . I don 't ask , because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here , and the answer is always - [ Together ] " Don 't ask . " So what do I tell this guy ? [ Sighs ] Tell him as far as I 'm concerned , if he finds something , it is his . Lydecker ? What ? [ Giggling ] You kids know you 're not supposed to be on this level ! Go on ! Get outta here ! [ Giggling ] [ Boy ] Do too . You go in places we can 't fit . So ? That 's why I 'm the best . Knock it off ! I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again , I 'll tan your hides . Mom , all the kids play - Wait a minute . Annie , come and have a look at this , will ya ? Folks , we have scored big this time . What is it , Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's see if we can 't get a closer look at this thing , maybe through that crack there on the side . - Shouldn 't we call in ? - Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . [ Brakes Hiss ] [ Dad ] That 's about as close as we can get . Should we take a look inside ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Wind Whistling ] You two stay inside . I mean it . We 'll be right back . Okay . Bye . [ Thunderclap ] [ Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] Huh ? Timmy , they 've been gone a long time . It 'll be okay , Newt . Dad knows what he 's doing . [ Banging ] Mayday , Mayday ! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling ! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner ! [ Screaming ] Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling ! [ Meowing ] [ Doorbell Beeps ] [ Clears Throat ] Hiya , Ripley . This is Lieutenant Gorman ... of the Colonial Marine Corps - Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me at the wolves , and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . Can I finish ? No . There 's no way . Ripley , you wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I can guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . - Lieutenant , am I right ? - That 's true . We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . Then you don 't need me . I 'm not a soldier . [ Burke ] Yeah , but we don 't know exactly what 's going on out there . It mayjust be a downed transmitter , okay ? But if it 's not , I would like you there as an adviser , and that 's all . What 's your interest in all this ? Why are you going ? Corporation cofinanced that colony , along with Colonial Administration . We 're getting into a lot of terraforming now . " Building Better Worlds " - Yeah , yeah . I saw the commercial . Look , I don 't have time for this . I 've got to get to work . Oh , right . I heard you 're working the cargo docks . That 's right . Running loaders and forklifts , that sort of thing ? Yeah . So ? Nothing . I think it 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing that you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated ... as a flight officer ? The company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . Yeah , if you go . Come on . That 's a second chance , kiddo . I think , personally , for you , it would be the best thing in the world ... to get out there and face this thing , get back on the horse . Spare me , Burke . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . Yeah , I know . I 've read it . You wake up every night . Your sheets are soaking with sweat - I said no , and I mean it ! Now , please leave . I am not going back . And I am - I would not be any good to you if I did . Okay . Shh . Would you do me a favor ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Meows ] [ Screaming , Panting ] Oh ! [ Sobbing ] [ Water Running ] [ Beeping ] Hello . Ripley . You okay ? Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study , not to bring back , but to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right . I 'm in . I think that - And you , you little shithead , [ Chuckles ] you 're staying here . [ Creaking ] [ Beeping ] [ Whirring ] Mmm . [ Coughing ] [ Groans ] They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? Is that a joke ? Oh , I wish it were . Hey , Hicks . Man , you look just like I feel . [ Grunts ] - [ Coughing ] - All right , sweethearts . What are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm - every meal 's a banquet , every paycheck a fortune , every formation a parade . I love the corps ! Christ ! Man , this floor is freezing ! What do you want me to do ? Fetch your slippers for ya ? Gee , would you , sir ? I 'd like that . Look into my eye . Fall in , people . Come on . Let 's go . I hate this job . Crowe , Wierzbowski . Come on . On your feet . We got some slack coming , right ? You had three weeks on your back , Frost . What do you want ? [ Frost ] I 'm talking about breathing , not this frozen shit . [ Dietrich ] Yeah , Top . How ' bout it ? [ Apone ] All right . First assembly 's in 15 , people . Shag it . Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . Apparently , she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fuckin ' - do ! Hey , I 'm impressed . iQue bonita ! Hey , Vasquez . Have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? Ha , ha ! Oh , Vasquez . You 're just too bad . Uhh ! [ Chattering ] Hey , Top , what 's the op ? It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity . [ Spunkmeyer ] Dumb-ass colonists . What 's this crap supposed to be ? Vasquez . Corn bread , I think . It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . Hey , sure wouldn 't mind getting some more of that Arcturian poontang . - Remember that time ? - Yeah . Except the one that you had was male . Doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian . Hey , Bishop , man . Do the thing with the knife . Oh , please . Oh , come on . Yeah . [ All Goading ] All right ! Yeah . - I don 't want to see that , man . - Come on , man . All right . All right . Hey , what are you doing , man ? What are you doing ? Come on . Quit messing around , Drake . Hudson , shut up ! - Bishop , hey , man . - [ Drake ] Do it , Bishop ! Hey ! Not me , man ! Quit messing around ! Yeah , you ! Don 't move . Trust me . Aah ! [ Apone ] All right . Knock it off , knock it off . - Thank you . - [ Drake Chuckles ] There you go , short shit . Enjoy your meal . That wasn 't funny , man . Lieutenant Gorman ? Mr. Burke ? Yeah , thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . Boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . [ Burke ] Thought you never miss , Bishop . You never said anything about an android being on board . Why not ? [ Chuckles ] It never - never occurred to me . It 's just common practice . We always have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term " artificial person " myself . Right . - Is there a problem ? - [ Burke ] I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't even - Ripley 's last trip out , the syn - the artificial person malfunctioned . - Malfunctioned ? - There were problems and a few deaths were involved . I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? The Hyperdyne Systems 1 20-A2 . That explains it then . The A2s always were a bit twitchy . That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm , or by omission ofaction , allow to be harmed , a human being . - You sure you don 't want some ? - [ Clattering ] You just stay away from me , Bishop . You got that straight ? Guess she don 't like the corn bread , either . [ Chattering ] [ Apone ] Squad , ten-hut ! Officer on deck ! As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right . Listen up ! Morning , marines. I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you people before we left Gateway - [ Hudson ] Sir ? What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . What 's the question ? Is this gonna be a stand-up fight , sir , or another bug hunt ? All we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony ... and that a xenomorph may be involved . Excuse me , sir . A what ? A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . - What exactly are we dealing with here ? - Ripley . I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . One ofour crew members was brought back on board with something attached to his face , some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off . It wouldn 't come off . Later , it seemed to come off by itselfand die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner , and , um , it must have laid something inside his throat , some sort of embryo . He started - Um , he - [ Vasquez ] Look , man . I only need to know one thing - where they are . Yo , Vasquez . Kick ass . Anytime , anywhere . Right , right . Somebody said " alien . " She thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up . Fuck you , man . Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Yeah , okay , right . Thank you , Ripley . We also have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . And if the colonists have found that ship , then there 's no telling ... how many of them have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so you better look at it . Any questions ? What is it , Private ? How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth ... and by the numbers . I want D.C.S. and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . [ All Scoffing ] Ordinance loading , weapons strip and drop-ship prep details ... will have seven hours . Oh , come on . Now , move it , people ! All right , sweethearts . You heard the man , and you know the drill . Assholes and elbows ! Hudson , come here . Come here . I don 't care if you are short , Hudson . Get it done . Hey , Sarge . You 'll get lip cancer smoking those . Corporal , I want this loading lock sealed . Now ! How many more you got , Spunkmeyer ? Last one . Good . Take it away . [ Whirring , Thudding ] Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Let me see that . Hi . I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here . Is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class 2 rating . Be my guest . [ Whirring ] - Where you want it ? - [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] Bay 12 , please . [ Engines Revving ] [ Apone ] All right , sweethearts . We 're a team , and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we gonna conquer , and we gonna kick some . Is that understood ? That 's what we gonna do , sweethearts . Yes , sir . We are going to go and get some . Hey . All right , people ! On the ready line ! Are you lean ? Are you mean ? [ All ] Yeah ! Yeah ! What are you ? What are you ? Lean and mean ! Hudson ! Get on the ready line , marine ! Get some today ! Get on the ready line ! Yo ! Move it out ! Move it out , goddamn it ! Get hot ! One , two , three ! Get out , get out , get out ! Move it out , move it out , move it out ! Move it out , move it out , move it out ! [ Barking Orders , Indistinct ] [ Growls ] Absolutely badasses . Let 's pack ' em in . Get in there ! All right ! Move it ! Let 's go , let 's go ! One , two , three , four , five , six ! All right . I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed . Let 's go . Come on . Settle down , people . Lock ' em in , Hudson . Ready to get it on ? You know it ! Okay , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on ! Go ! [ Murmurs Of Agreement ] [ Ferro On Headsets ] Stand by . Cross-locking now . Prelaunch autocycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Shit , man . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . [ Gorman ] Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by . Ten seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer ... on my mark . - Five , four , three , - We 're on an express elevator to hell , going down . two , one , mark . Woo-hoo ! - Switch to D.C.S. ranging . - [ Spunkmeyer ] 240 , nominal to profile . We 're in the pipe , five by five . We 're picking up some hull ionization . Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . [ Rumbling ] How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? Thirty-eight . Simulated . How many combat drops ? Uh , two ... including this one . - Shit . - Oh , man ! Range 014 . Turning on final . [ Frost ] And I 'm telling you , I got a bad feeling about this drop . [ Crowe ] You always say that , Frost . You always say , " I got a bad feeling about this drop . " [ Frost ] Okay , okay . When we get back without you , I 'll call your folks . [ Laughs ] [ Beeping ] All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody online . Looking good . Drake , check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . - Good . - I 'm ready , man . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . Yeah . That 's right . State-of-the-badass art . You do not want to fuck with me . Who here 's runnin ' ? Check it out . [ Chuckles ] Hey , Ripley , don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . Hey ! That 's right . Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam phalanx . [ Imitates Blast Noise ] Fry halfa city with this puppy . We got tactical smart missiles , phase-plasma pulse rifles , R.P.G. ' s . - We got sonic , electronic ball breakers ! - [ Vasquez ] Whoo ! We got nukes , we got knives , sharp sticks - Knock it off , Hudson . All right , gear up . Two minutes , people . Get hot . Somebody wake up Hicks . Coming around for a 709er . Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . That 's the atmosphere processor ? Yep , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . You know , we manufacture those , by the way . [ Gorman ] Okay , Ferro . Take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . All right . Hold at 40 . [ Ferro On Headset ] Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . They still have power . Okay , Ferro . Set down on the landing grid . Immediate dust off on my clear , then stay on station . [ Ferro ] Down and clear . Ten seconds , people . Look sharp . All right . I want a nice , clean dispersal this time . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Head ' em up ! First squad up on line . Hicks , get yours in accord and watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move ! Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . [ Apone Over Headsets ] Second squad on line . [ Door Lock Clicks ] [ Whispers ] You set ? Go on . Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . [ Apone ] Sir , you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . Uh , we got some explosives damage . It 's probably seismic survey charges . Are you reading this ? Keep it tight , people . [ Gorman ] All right . Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . [ Clicking ] Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . [ Snaps Fingers ] Okay . Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . [ Sniffs ] [ Clicking Continues ] [ Beeping ] It 's right in there . [ High-pitched Beeping ] Now ! Now ! - Haah ! Uh - - Good one , Hudson ! [ Hudson ] Uh , sir , uh , we have a negative situation here . Uh , movin ' on , sir [ Clicking ] Wait . Wait , tell him to - Hicks , back up . Pan right . - There . - You seeing this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you like that , you 're gonna love this . [ Hocking ] Quit screwing around . Second squad , what 's your status ? [ Hicks ] Uh , we just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , I think we missed it . [ Sighs ] All right . The area 's secured . Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us . - Wait a minute . It 's not secure . - The area 's secured , Ripley . First team , head for operations . Hudson , see if you can get their C.P.U. on line . Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . Roger . He 's comin ' in . I feel safer already . Pendejo jerk-off . [ Hudson On Radio ] Sir , we got the C.P.U. on line . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . Okay , let 's go . Are you all right ? Yes . Sir , they sealed off this wing at both ends , welded the doors and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . [ Gorman ] Mm-hmm . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . Any bodies ? No , sir . Last stand . [ Drake ] Must have been a hell ofa fight . Yeah , looks that way . [ Gorman ] All right , Drake , this way . We should be able to cut through the medlab to Operations . [ Hicks ] Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones that - Careful , Burke . Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . [ Chuckles ] Two are alive . The rest are dead . " Surgically removed before embryo implantation . Subject Marachek , John J. , died during the procedure . " They killed him taking it off . [ Clicking , Beeping ] Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . Behind us . One of us ? Apone , where are your people ? Anybody in " D " block ? [ Apone On Radio ] Ah , that 's a negative . We 're all in Operations . Talk to me , Frosty . Let 's keep moving , baby . [ Crash ] It 's moving . Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . [ High-pitched Beeping ] Fuck ! Hold up . Ripley . Hey . Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right . Come on . Just grab her , Corporal . Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . Shh . It 's all right . It 's okay . Come on out . Come on . - Easy . Easy . - I got her . Ow ! Damn ! Watch her ! She 's under the grille ! Don 't let her go . Frost , get your light up here . Where 'd she go ? Shine the light . Here . Here . Here . Here . There she is . [ Ripley ] Keep back . Keep back . Don 't scare her . [ Hicks ] Grab her , man . We 're gonna lose her . [ Ripley ] Damn it ! [ Hicks ] Kick it out ! [ Grunts ] Wait . [ Clattering ] It 's okay . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . See ? Wait . No , you don 't . [ Screams ] It 's okay . You 're gonna be all right now . [ Whimpering ] Shh . Easy . Easy . It 's gonna be okay . It 's all right . You 're gonna be okay . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Easy . Easy . [ Whirring ] What 's her name again ? Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? Now , look , Rebecca , you have to try and help - Gorman , give it a rest , why don 't you ? [ Sighs ] Total brain lock . Physically , she 's okay . Borderline malnutrition , but I don 't think there 's any permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . Whoop . That good , huh ? Uh-oh . I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one too . You don 't talk much , do you ? Smoking or nonsmoking ? Just tell me what you 're scanning for , Private . P.D.T.s. What ? Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within 20 klicks , we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . I don 't know how you managed to stay alive , but you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . [ Whispers ] N-Newt . - What 'd you say ? - Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt ? I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this , hmm ? Casey . Hello , Casey . What about your brother ? What 's his name ? Timmy . Is Timmy around here too ? Maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and dad ? Newt , look at me . Where are they ? They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . [ Door Opens ] [ Cart 's Wheels Clacking ] Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . That 's a nice pet you got there , Bishop . Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo ! Stop your grinnin and drop your linen ! Found ' em . They alive ? Unknown , but it looks like all of them . Over at the processing station , Sublevel 3 , under the main cooling towers . Looks like a goddamn town meeting . Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . All right . Let 's go , people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Let 's go . Head ' em out ! Okay , Frost , you 're driving . It 's okay . Don 't worry . It 'll be okay . [ Gorman On Radio ] I want a straight " V " deployment , second team on left flank . Advance on axial 664 . Tracker on line . Set the " V " gain to filter R.F. ambient . [ Apone ] Hudson , tracker on line . Left and right , little buddy . [ Clicking ] [ Gorman ] Forty meters in , bearing 221 , there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . [ Gorman ] You want Sublevel 3 . [ Apone ] Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . Check those corners . Watch your spacing . [ Apone ] All right . You heard the man . Don 't bunch up . Stay loose . [ Gorman ] Uh , your transmission 's showing a lot ofbreakup . [ Hudson ] Probably getting some interference from the structure . [ Apone ] Use those lights . [ Gorman ] Next one down , and proceed on a 216 . [ Apone ] Uh , roger . That 's a 216 . [ Gorman ] I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me , man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . [ Apone On Headset ] Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies in here . [ Apone ] Easy . [ Hicks ] Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . [ Apone ] Nice and easy . Looks like some sort of secreted resin . Yeah , but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothing . Busy little creatures , huh ? Hot as hell in here . Yeah , man , but it 's a dry heat . [ Apone ] Knock it off , Hudson . Lieutenant , what do those pulse rifles fire ? Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless . Standard light armor-piercing round . Why ? Well , look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So if they fire their weapons in there , won 't they rupture the cooling system ? - Ho , ho , ho . Yeah . She 's absolutely right . - So ? So what ? Look . This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So you 're talking about a thermonuclear explosion , and adios , muchachos . Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit ! Look . Uh ... Apone . [ Snapping Fingers ] Look . We can 't have any firing in there . I , uh , I want you to collect magazines from everybody . - Is he fuckin ' crazy ? - What the hell are we supposed to use , man , harsh language ? - Flame units only . I want rifles slung . - Sir , I - Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . All right , sweethearts . You heard the man . Pull ' em out . Come on . Let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn ! You too . Give it up , Ski . Come on . Let 's go . Crowe , I want it now . Give it up . Right on , Vas . Let 's go , marine . Give it up . Frost , you got the duty . Open that bag . - Thanks a lot , Sarge . - Hicks , cover our ass . Head ' em out , people . I like to keep this handy ... for close encounters . I heard that . [ Tracker Clicking ] [ Gorman ] Any movement ? Nothing . Zip . Holy shit . [ Ripley ] Newt , go sit up front . Go on ! Now ! [ Apone ] Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it moving . Easy . - Help ! - What ? Top , get over here . We got a live one ! You 're gonna be all right . Please ... k-kill me . [ Dietrich ] Just stay calm . We 're gonna get you outta here . It 's gonna be all right . Give me a hand . We gotta get her outta here . - What is it , Dietrich ? - Convulsion ! - [ Screaming ] - Dietrich , get back ! - Get back ! - [ Screams ] - No ! - Frost , flamethrower . Kill it ! Get back ! Flamethrower ! Move ! [ Alien Screeches ] - [ Groaning ] - [ Screeching ] [ Hissing ] [ Tracker Beeping ] Movement ! - What 's the position ? - I can 't lock in ! Talk to me , Hudson ! Multiple signals . They 're closing . Go to infrared , people . Look sharp ! What 's happening , Apone ? Can 't see anything in here . Pull your team out , Gorman . I got signals . I got readings in front and behind . Where , man ? I don 't see shit . He 's right . There 's nothing back here . Look , I 'm telling you . There 's something moving , and it ain 't us ! - Oh , shit . - [ Hudson ] Tracker 's off scale , man . They 're all around us , man ! Jesus ! Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] - Frost ! - [ Screams ] Come on ! - [ Steady Beep ] - Jesus Christ , Apone ! What is going on ? [ Hicks ] Wierzbowski and Crowe are down ! Dietrich , Crowe ! Sound off ! Frost ! Dietrich , Frost , off the board ! Frost ! [ Man Screaming ] Wierzbowski ? - Wierzbowski ? - [ Wierzbowski Screaming ] [ Grunts ] Let 's rock ! [ Drake Shouting ] [ Gunfire ] Who 's firing ? Goddamn it ! Yeah ! I ordered to hold fire . [ Hudson ] They 're coming out of the walls ! They 're coming out of the goddamn walls ! Let 's book ! [ Vasquez ] On the right , man . Uh , Apone , I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators - Vasquez , Drake , hold your fire , goddamn it ! [ Gorman ] Apone , are you copying me ? I want you to lay down suppressing fire ... with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the A.P.C. Over . Say again , all after " incinerator . " I said I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back ... by squads to the A.P.C. Over . [ Gunfire ] Hey ! [ Screaming ] - [ Hudson ] Sarge ! Sarge ! - Apone . Talk to me . Apone ? Copy ! Copy ! Talk to me , Apone . He 's gone ! Get them out of there ! Shut up ! Do it now ! Hicks , whoever 's left , get - Shut up ! Just shut up ! Goddamn it ! It 's coming out of the goddamn walls ! Where 's Apone ? Where 's Apone ? The sarge is gone ! Let 's get the fuck out of here ! Let 's move it ! Let 's go , marine ! Hudson ? Vasquez ? Hudson , look out ! Get it ! [ Alien Screeching ] Watch it ! Hicks . Come on . Behind you ! Fall back ! I told them to fall back . [ Hicks ] Fall back , goddamn it , now ! They 're cut off ! [ Hicks ] Hudson , move your ass ! Do something ! [ Hicks ] Let 's go , marine ! Fuck ! Come on . Keep moving , baby . Hold on , Newt . [ Engines Revving ] Ripley , what the hell are you doing ? [ Tires Squealing ] Turn around ! That 's an order ! Get offme , damn it ! Goddamn it , that 's an order ! You had your chance , Gorman . [ Tires Squealing ] Come on ! - Come on . Let 's move it ! - [ Screeches ] [ Vasquez ] Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! [ Hudson ] It 's blocked , man . We gotta go around ! - Open the door ! Hicks ! - Drake , we are leaving ! [ Drake ] Get them , man ! Run for it ! Shit ! [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] Go ! Go ! [ Vasquez ] Come on , man ! Come on ! - Drake , come on ! - [ Screeches ] - [ Screams ] - No ! - Fire in the hole ! - [ Hicks ] He 's gone ! Put it out ! Put it out ! Go ! Go ! - Come on . Put it out ! - Drake 's coming , man ! Drake ! No , he 's not ! He 's gone ! Forget him ! He 's gone ! They 're in the goddamn door ! Eat this ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Hicks ] Ripley ! Go , go , go ! [ Clatter ] It 's all right ! We 're clear ! [ Metal Clattering ] Ripley , you 've blown the transaxle ! You 're just grinding metal ! Come on , ease down . Ease down . Ease down . Ease down . Ease down . [ Newt Coughing ] You okay ? I 'm all right . Hudson . Get away from me , man ! Lieutenant . What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know . Maybe a concussion . But he 's alive . He 's dead ! Wake up , pendejo , and then I 'm gonna kill you ! Back off . Right now . Fuck ! Somebody get me a first aid kit . Hey . Hey , look . The sarge and Dietrich aren 't dead , man . Their signs are real low , but they ain 't dead . - Then we go back in there and get them . - Fuck that ! We don 't leave our people behind — I ain 't going back in there . You can 't help them ! You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . Oh , dear Lord Jesus , this ain 't happening ' , man . Damn it . This can 't be happenin ' , man . This isn 't happening ' ! All right . We got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fucking nest . That 's worth a try , but we don 't even know if it 's gonna affect them . Let 's just bug out and call it even . Okay ? What are we talking about this for ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Fuckin ' " A " ! Hold on . Hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it . They can bill me . Okay , look . This is an emotional moment for all of us , okay ? I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments , please . This is clearly - clearly an important species we 're dealing with , and I don 't think that you or I or anybody has the right ... - to arbitrarily exterminate them . - Wrong . Yeah . Watch us . Maybe you haven 't been keeping up on current events , but we just got our asses kicked , pal ! Look . I 'm not blind to what 's going on , but I cannot authorize that kind of action . I 'm sorry . Well , I believe Corporal Hicks ... has authority here . Corporal Hicks is - This operation is under military jurisdiction , and Hicks is next in chain of command . Am I right , Corporal ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . Look , Ripley . Yes . This is a multimillion-dollar installation , okay ? He can 't make that kind of decision . He 's just a grunt . Uh , no offense . None taken . Ferro , do you copy ? Standing by . Prep for dust off . We 're gonna need immediate evac . Roger . On our way . I say we take off , nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . [ Wind Whistling ] Let 's go . Pick it up , Hudson . Pick it up , baby . All right . Set him down here . Move it , Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . Hold on a second . There 's something - [ Ferro ] Just get up here . I 'm in . Ramp closing . Spunkmeyer . Goddamn it . [ Door Opens ] Well , where the fuck - [ Hisses ] Run ! Well , that 's great . That 's just fuckin ' great , man . Now what the fuck are we supposed to do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now , man ! Are you finished ? You all right ? I guess we 're not gonna be leaving now , right ? I 'm sorry , Newt . You don 't have to be sorry . It wasn 't your fault . That 's it , man . Game over , man ! Game over ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? What are we gonna do ? Maybe we could build a fire . Sing a couple of songs , huh ? Why don 't we try that ? We 'd better get back 'cause it 'll be dark soon , and they mostly come at night , mostly . That 's everything , right ? All right . This is absolutely everything ... that we could salvage out of the A.P.C. wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got , uh , 1 5 of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . Is that the only flamethrower ? [ Hicks ] Yeah . It 's only half full , but it 's functional . Got another one , it 's damaged — I don 't know about that one . But the good news - we got four of these robot sentries , with display and scanners intact . They really kick ass . I think they 'll come in handy . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? Seventeen days . Seventeen days ? Hey , man , I don 't wanna rain on your parade , but we 're not gonna last 17 hours . Those things are gonna come in here like they did before . They 're gonna come in here - Hudson ! Hudson ! They 're gonna come in here and they 're gonna get us ! This little girl survived longer than that ... with no weapons and no training . Right ? Why don 't you put her in charge ? You 'd better just start dealing with it , Hudson . Listen to me . Hudson , just deal with it because we need you . And I 'm sick of your bullshit . Now , I want you to get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file . Do you understand ? Construction blueprints . I don 't care . Anything that shows the layout of this place . Are you listening ? Yeah . I need to see air ducts . I need to see electrical access tunnels , subbasements , every possible way into this complex . - We don 't have much time . - Okay . Okay , I 'm on it . Hudson ! - Just relax . - [ Exhales Sharply ] I 'll be in medlab . I 'll check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . So this service tunnel must be how they 're moving back and forth . That 's right . It moves from the processing station ... right into the sublevel here . Come down on that . Okay , come over . Hold . Go back . Okay , punch that in right there . No . It 's back here . Okay . Well , there 's a pressure door at this end . Couldn 't we put one of the remote sentry units in the tunnel and then seal that door ? Yeah , that 'll work , but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . That 's right , so we repair the barricades at these two intersections . Right . And weld plate steel over these ducts ... here and here and here . That way they can only come at us from these two corridors . All right . Then we put the other sentry units here and here , right ? Right . Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . All right , people . Let 's move like we got a purpose . [ Hudson ] Affirmative . Affirmative . [ Beeping ] Do your thing , baby . Come on , Vasquez . Let 's get the hell outta here . Hudson here . " A " and " B " sentries are in place and keyed . Roger . Stand by . Arming now . Test it , Hudson . Do it ! Fire in the hole ! Okay , great . Let 's get the hell outta here ! We 're sealing the tunnel . Come on , baby . [ Welder Crackling ] For what it 's worth . Here . I want you to put this on . - What 's it for ? - It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . [ Beeping ] It 's just a precaution . Thanks . Doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . All right , what 's next ? [ Beeping ] [ Door Closes ] Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now , you lie here and have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to . I have scary dreams . Well , I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nope . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her , hmm ? Ripley , she doesn 't have bad dreams ... because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry , Newt . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are . Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Did one of those things grow inside her ? I don 't know , Newt . That 's the truth . Isn 't that how babies come ? I mean , people babies ? They grow inside you . Oh , that 's very different . Did you ever have a baby ? Yes , I did . I had a little girl . Where is she ? She 's gone . You mean dead . Here . Take this . For luck . There 's that . Don 't go , please . Newt , I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera right up there ? I can see you right through that camera , all the time to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you , Newt . I mean that . That 's a promise . You promise ? I cross my heart . - And hope to die ? - And hope to die . [ Kisses ] Now go to sleep , and don 't dream . [ Laughs ] Sneak . [ Door Opens ] The molecular acid oxidizes after the creature 's death , completely neutralizing it . Bishop , you know , that 's very interesting , but it doesn 't really get us anywhere , does it ? I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with here . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists , they move them over there ... and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these . Which would mean that there would have to be a lot of these parasites , right ? One for each colonist . That 's over 100 , at least . Yes . Τhat follows . But each one of these things comes from an egg , right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . Hey , maybe it 's like an ant hive . Bees , man . Bees have hives . You know what I mean . There 's , like , one female that runs the whole show . Yes , the queen . Ueah , the mama . She 's badass , man . I mean , big . These things ain 't ants , estúpido . I know that . Bishop , I want these specimens destroyed as soon as you 're finished with them . - Is that clear ? - Mr. Burke gave instructions ... that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs . He was very specific about it . Look . Those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division , right ? Now , if you 're smart , we can both come out of this heroes , and we will be set up for life . You 're crazy , Burke . Do you know that ? Do you really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it , Burke , from me . Just like they 'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists . Wait a second . You sent them to that ship . You 're wrong . I just checked the colony log . Directive dated 6-1 2-79 , signed Burke , Carter J. You sent them out there , and you didn 't even warn them . Why didn 't you warn them , Burke ? Okay , look . What if that ship didn 't even exist ? Do you ever think about that ? I didn 't know . So now if I went and made a major security situation out of it , everybody steps in , administration steps in , and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . Nobody wins . So I made a decision , and it was wrong . It was a bad call , Ripley . It was a bad call . Bad call ? Right . These people are dead , Burke ! Don 't you have any idea what you 've done here ? I 'm gonna make sure that they nail you right to the wall for this ! You 're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . Ripley . I - You know , I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . Well , I 'm happy to disappoint you . [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Hudson ] What is it ? What 's going on ? - They 're coming . Where ? In the tunnel . [ Automatic Gunfire ] Here we go . " A " and " B " gun tracking far end . Multiple targets . Those ammo counters go . " B " gun 's down 50 % .. Man , it 's a shooting gallery down there . - [ Hicks ] Sixty rounds left on " B. " - [ Beeping ] Forty . Twenty . Ten . " B " gun 's dry . Twenty on " A. " - Ten . Five . - [ Steady Beep ] That 's it . Jesus , they were wall-to-wall in there . [ Pounding ] They 're at the pressure door . Man , listen to that . Bishop here . I 'm afraid I have some bad news . Well , that 's a switch . It 's very pretty , Bishop , but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . Oh , that 's beautiful , man . Oh , man , that - that just beats it all . How long till it blows ? Four hours . [ Groans ] With a blast radius of 30 kilometers , equal to about 40 megatons . We got problems . [ Hudson ] I don 't believe this . I don 't fucking believe this . Vasquez , close the shutters . Why can 't we shut it down from here ? I 'm sorry . The crash caused too much damage . An overload is inevitable at this point . Oh , man , and I was getting short . Four more weeks and out . Now I 'm gonna buy it on this rock . It ain 't half fair , man . Hudson , give us a break ! [ Hudson ] Four more weeks . Oh , man . We 've got to get the other drop ship from the Sulaco . I mean , there must be some way of bringing it down on remote . How ? The transmitter was on the A.P.C. It 's wasted . I don 't care how , but we 'd better think of something . We 'd better think of a way . Think of what ? We 're fucked ! We 're doomed ! Shut up ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? The uplink tower down at the other end . Why can 't we use that ? No , I checked . The hardware in between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Well , somebody 's gonna have to go out there , take a portable terminal , go out there and patch in manually . Oh , yeah , sure . With those things running around ? You can count me out . Guess we can just count you out of everything . I 'll go . [ Hudson ] That 's right , man . Why don 't you go , man ? [ Bishop ] I 'll go . What ? I 'll go . I mean , I 'm the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway . Yeah , right , man . Bishop should go . Good idea . Believe me , I 'd prefer not to . I may be synthetic , but I 'm not stupid . [ Ripley ] How long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly - 1 80 meters . Say 40 minutes to crawl down there - [ Ripley ] Right . An hour to patch in and align the antenna . Thirty minutes to prep the ship , and about 50 minutes flight time . It 's gonna be close . Good luck . See you soon . Watch your fingers . [ Grunts ] Vaya con Dios , man . This is unbelievable . Twenty meters and closing . Fifteen . How many ? [ Hicks ] Can 't tell . Lots . " D " gun 's down 50 % .. [ Aliens Screeching ] " C " gun 's right behind it . [ Hudson ] Stopping them . It ain 't stopping them . - [ Hicks ] 150 rounds on " D. " - [ Hudson ] Come on . Come on , baby . [ Hicks ] Hundred rounds . [ Hudson ] Come on ! Come on ! [ Beeping ] " D " gun 's down to 20 . Ten . Damn it ! Wait ! They 're retreating . [ Ripley ] The guns stopped them . You 're right . Next time they walk right up and knock . Yeah , but they don 't know that . They 're probably looking for other ways to get in . That 'll take ' em a while . Maybe we got ' em demoralized . Shut up ! I want you two walking perimeter . Move ! Hey , listen . We 're all in strung-out shape , but stay frosty and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . Vámonos . How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? Twenty-four hours ? Hicks , I 'm not gonna end up like those others . You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? If it comes to that , I 'll do us both . Listen , let 's just make sure it doesn 't come to that . All right ? All right . Hey , I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine . This is an M-41A pulse rifle , 10 millimeter , with an over-and-under 30 millimeter pump-action grenade launcher . Feel the weight . Okay , what do I do ? Okay , pull it in tight here . Right . Uh-huh . Lean into it . Mm-hmm . All right . Now , it will kick some . All right . When the counter reads zero here , you - I press this up ? That 's right . Get another one in quick . Slap it in hard . Right . And you 're ready to rock and roll . What 's this ? That 's the grenade launcher . I don 't think you want to mess with that . You started this . Show me everything . I can handle myself . Yeah , I noticed . How do you feel ? All right , I guess . One hell of a hangover . Look , Ripley , I just want - Forget it . Excuse me . [ Newt Groaning ] Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's okay . It 's okay . [ Whispering ] Newt , wake up . Wha - Be quiet . We 're in trouble . - No ! - [ Screams ] Move , Newt ! [ Both Grunting ] Hey ! [ No Audio ] Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Somebody ! [ Hicks ] Say again , Bishop . You 've got it into auto-refuel mode , and it 's sequencing right ? [ Bishop On Radio ] That 's right . Okay , good . Stay on it . [ Indistinct ] Get back to me when you 've activated the launch cycle . Roger . He 's at the uplink tower . Good . Terrific . [ Ripley ] Hicks ! Hicks ! Hicks ! [ Newt ] Help ! - Help ! Help ! - Hicks , help us ! - Break the glass ! Break it . Break it . - Yes . I 'll try . [ Scurrying ] [ Clinking ] Ripley , I 'm scared . Me too . Stay here . [ Alarm Blaring ] It 's the medlab . Hudson ! Vasquez , meet me in medlab . We got a fire . [ Hudson On Radio ] We 're on our way . They 're coming , Newt . [ Screaming ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Screaming Continues ] [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasping ] [ Screaming Continues ] Shoot it out ! - Hudson ! - Jesus . [ Gasping ] Christ , kid , look out ! Fucking die . Over there ! Ready ? Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Hicks ] Now ! Hudson ? Yeah . All clear . Nailed the other one . It 's history , man . [ Coughing ] Jesus . Burke - [ Coughs ] It was Burke . I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now . Just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine ... if one of us was impregnated - whatever you call it - and then frozen for the trip home . Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying - me and Newt . Wait a minute , now . We 'd all know . Yes . The only way he could do it ... is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home . Namely yours . Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . Fuck ! He 's dead . You 're dog meat , pal . This is so nuts . I mean , listen - Listen to what you 're saying . It 's paranoid delusion . It 's really sad . It 's pathetic . You know , Burke , I don 't know which species is worse . You don 't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage . All right . We waste him . No offense . No ! He 's gotta go back - They cut the power . What do you mean , they cut the power ? How could they cut the power , man ? They 're animals . I want you two with trackers , checking the corridors ! Move ! [ Ripley ] Gorman , watch Burke ! I got him . Newt , stay close . I 'll go this side . You do that , man . [ Tracker Clicking ] Anything ? [ Hudson ] There 's something . [ Beeping ] It 's inside the complex . You 're just reading me . No , no , it ain 't you . They 're inside - inside the perimeter . They 're in here . [ Ripley ] Hudson , stay cool ! Vasquez ? [ Clicking ] [ Beeping ] Hudson may be right . Get back , both of you ! [ Hudson ] The signal 's weird . Must be some interference or something . There 's movement all over the place ! Get back to Operations . It 's game time . Newt . Seal the door . Hurry ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Get back ! Work fast . Cover your eyes , Newt . Don 't look at the light . Movement . Signal 's clean . Range , 20 meters . They found a way in , something we missed . We didn 't miss anything . Eighteen . Seventeen meters . Something under the floor , not in the plans . I don 't know . - Fifteen meters . - Ripley ! - Definitely inside the barricades . - Let 's go . Thirteen meters . That 's right outside the door . Hicks , Vasquez , get back ! This is a big fucking signal . - How you doing , Vasquez ? Talk to me . - Almost there . That 's it . Twelve meters . Eleven . [ High-pitched Beeping ] - Ten . - Then they 're right on us . - Nine meters . - Remember - short , controlled bursts . Eight meters . Seven . - Six . - It can 't be . That 's inside the room . - It 's reading right , man . Look ! - Well , you 're not reading it right . [ Hudson ] Five meters , man . Four . What the hell ? [ Beeping Continues ] Oh , my God . Oh , sh - Give me the light . [ Shouting ] There they go ! Over there ! Get them ! - [ Aliens Shrieking ] - Come on ! Get them ! Do something , Gorman ! [ Hudson ] Get them ! Look out ! There 's more of them ! There 's more of them ! Medical ! Get to Medical ! Do it ! Now ! [ Hicks ] Hudson , look out ! Look out ! [ Shouts , Screams ] Now ! Burke ! Open this door ! Burke ! Open it ! [ Shouting ] Go ! Fall back ! - Go ! - [ Shouting ] - Die , motherfucker ! - Burke ! Hudson ! Hudson ! Motherfucker ! Come on ! Come on ! Come and get it , baby ! Come on ! I don 't got all day ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on , you bastard ! Come on ! You too ! Oh , you want some of this ? [ Shrieking Continues ] Fuck you ! [ Screams ] Fuck you ! Hicks ! - Hudson ! - [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Come on . Let 's go ! It 's locked ! - Got it ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Go ! Go ! - Move , Gorman ! - Seal it ! Burke ! Goddamn you ! Open this door ! [ Gasps ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Screams ] - [ Hicks ] Get back ! - Hurry up . - Gorman , get out of the way ! Ripley , this way ! What - Wait . Get behind me . Whatever you 're gonna do , do it fast ! Hicks ! Go ! Come on . Let 's go . Move ! Which way is it to the landing field from here ? This way . [ Aliens Shrieking ] [ Newt ] Go right . This way . This way . - Which way ? - Straight ahead and left . Bishop , do you read me ? Come in . Over . [ Bishop ] The ship is on its way . E.T.A. , 16 minutes . Stand by there . We 're on our way . - Which way now ? - That way . No , wait . This way . You sure ? Vasquez , move ! Right up here . It 's just up here . Hicks ! We 're almost there . Newt , wait ! Newt ! [ Shrieking ] [ Shouts ] [ Screams ] Vasquez ! - [ Grunting ] - Go ! [ Groaning ] Oh , no ! [ Pounding ] Newt . Up there . There 's a shortcut across the roof . Hicks . [ Clicking ] [ Aliens Hissing ] You always were an asshole , Gorman . - [ Ripley Grunts ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Ripley ] Newt ! God ! - Ripley ! Newt ! Hicks ! Hicks , get her ! Hurry ! [ Gasping ] - Hold on , Newt ! - I 'm slipping ! - Don 't let go . - Ripley ! - Hold on . Gotcha ! - Help ! - I gotcha . - [ Fabric Tearing ] - [ Screaming ] - Newt ! [ Screaming Continues ] No ! Come on . We can find her with this . [ Beeping ] - Stay where you are , Newt . - Ripley ! - We 're coming . - [ Beeping Continues ] Ripley ! [ Beeping Speed Increases ] This way . She 's close . Newt ! Ripley ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? Newt ! Here ! I 'm here ! Where ? Newt , are you okay ? [ Grunts ] We 'll have to cut it . Climb down , honey . We 've gotta cut through . Newt ? Now , don 't move . Stay very still . Okay . We 're almost there . Hang in there , okay ? [ Beeping ] [ High-pitched Beeping ] Hicks . Hurry . I know . I know ! I mean it ! [ Beeping Continues ] Newt ? Newt , just stay still . - [ Screams ] - Almost there . No ! Newt ! [ Grunts ] No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Let 's go . No ! No ! They don 't kill you ! They - They don 't kill you ! They - She 's alive ! She 's alive ! All right . I believe you . She 's alive . We 've got to go . Now ! [ Ripley ] Go ! [ High-pitched Beeping ] - [ Screams ] - [ Shrieking ] [ Groaning ] Get it off ! Hicks . [ Groaning Continues ] Get it off ! [ Coughing ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Groaning , Coughing Continue ] Here . Go . Come on . You can make it . [ Beeping ] Bishop , how much time ? Plenty . Twenty-six minutes . We 're not leaving . We 're not ? [ Beeping ] Ripley - I don 't wanna hear about it , Bishop . She 's alive . There 's still time . In 19 minutes , this area is gonna be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska . Hicks , don 't let him leave . We ain 't going anywhere . [ Beeping Continues ] See you , Hicks . Dwayne . It 's Dwayne . Ellen . Don 't be gone long , Ellen . [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Computer Voice ] Attention . Emergency .

 Jennifer . Oh , man , are you a sight for sore eyes . Let me look at you . Marty , you 're acting like you haven 't seen me in a week . - I haven 't . - Are you okay ? Is everything all right ? Oh , yeah . Everything 's great . [ * Loud Electrical Crackling * ] Marty ! You 've got to come back with me . Where ? Back to the future . Wait a minute . What are you doing , Doc ? I need fuel . Go ahead . Quick . Get in the car . No , no . Look , Doc , I just got here.Jennifer 's here . - We 're gonna take the new truck for a spin . - Well , bring her along . - This concerns her too . - What are you talking about ? What happens to us in the future ? Do we become assholes or something ? Oh , no . You and Jennifer both turn out fine . It 's your kids , Marty . Something 's got to be done about your kids . Doc , you better back up . We don 't have enough road to get up to 88 . Roads ? Where we 're going , we don 't need roads . Say , Marty ! Marty , I wanted to show you these new matchbooks ... for my auto detailing I had printed up . A flying DeLorean ? What the hell is going on here ? [ Honking ] - What the hell was that ? - Taxicab . - Who do you mean a taxicab ? I thought we were flying . - Precisely . All right , Doc . What 's going on , huh ? Where are we ? When are we ? We 're descending toward Hill Valley , California , at 4 : 29 p.m. , on Wednesday , October 21 , 201 5 . 201 5 ? You mean we 're in the future . Future , Marty ? What do you mean ? How can we be in the future ? Ah , Jennifer , um , I don 't know how to tell you this , but ... you 're in a time machine . [ * Jennifer * ] * And this is the year 20 1 5 ? * * October 2 1 , 20 1 5 . * * God , so , like , * * you weren 't kidding . * Marty , we can actually see our future . - Doc , you said we were married , right ? - Yea- - uh- - * Yeah ? Was it * * a big wedding ? * - * We 're gonna be able to see our wedding . * - Wow . - * I 'm gonna be able to see * * my wedding dress . * - * Wow . * I wonder where we live . I bet it 's a big house with lots of kids . - How many kids- - - [ Beeping ] Doc ! What are you doing ? * Relax , Marty . It 's just a sleep-inducing * * alpha rhythm generator . * She was asking too many questions ... and no one should know too much about their future . * When she wakes up , * * she 'll think it was all a dream . * - What did you bring her for ? - * I had to do something . * She saw the time machine . I couldn 't just leave her there with that information . Don 't worry . She 's not essential to my plan . - Well , you 're the doc , Doc . - Here 's our exit . You 've got to get out and change clothes . Right now ? It 's pouring rain . Wait five more seconds . Right on the tick . * Amazing . * * Absolutely amazing . * Too bad the post office isn 't as efficient as the weather service . * Excuse the disguise , Marty , but I was * * afraid you wouldn 't recognize me . * I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got a whole natural overhaul . * They took out some wrinkles , * * did a hair repair , * changed the blood , added a good 30 to 40 years to my life . They also replaced my spleen and colon . What do you think ? You look great , Doc . The future . Unbelievable . I got to check this out , Doc . All in good time , Marty . We 're on a tight schedule . Tell me about my future . I know I make it big . But what ? Do I become , like , a rich rock star ? No one should know too much about their own destiny . Right . Right . I am rich though , right ? Marty , please . Take off your shirt . Put on the jacket and the shoes . Got a mission to accomplish . * Uh-huh . Precisely * * on schedule . * Power laces . All right . [ Beeping ] This thing doesn 't fit . - [ * Computer Voice * ] * I 'm adjusting fit . * - Pull out your pants pockets . All kids in the future wear their pants inside-out . Put on this cap . Perfect . You 're the spitting image of your future son . - What ? - Help me moveJennifer over here . - So what 's the deal ? - Grab her feet . Okay , now what ? In exactly two minutes , you go around the corner into the Cafe 80s . Cafe 80s ? It 's one of those nostalgia places , but not done very well . Go in and order a Pepsi . Here 's a 50 . Then wait for a guy named Griff . Right . Griff . Griff 's going to ask you about tonight- - Are you in or out ? Tell him you are out . Whatever he says , whatever happens , say no , you 're not interested . Then leave , come back here and wait for me . Don 't talk to anyone . Don 't touch anything . Don 't do anything . Don 't interact with anyone , - and try not to look at anything . - I don 't get it . I thought you said this had something to do with my kids . Look what happens to your son . My son ? God , he looks just like me . " Within two hours of his arrest , " Martin McFly , Jr . , was tried , convicted ... and sentenced to 1 5 years in the state penitentiary " ? - Within two hours ? - The justice system works swiftly in the future ... - now that they 've abolished all lawyers . - Oh , this is heavy . It gets worse . Next week your daughter attempts to break him out of jail ... and she gets sent up for 20 years . Wha- - My daughter ? Wait a minute . I have a daughter ? You see , this one event starts a chain reaction ... that completely destroys your entire family . Hey , Doc , this date- - This is tomorrow 's newspaper . Precisely . I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens . I backtracked everything to this one event . That 's why we 're here today- - to prevent this incident from ever happening . - [ Beeping ] - Damn ! I 'm late ! Wait a minute . Where are you going now ? To intercept the real Marty , Jr . You 're taking his place . Around the corner at the cafe 80s , a guy named Griff , just say no . Hey , what aboutJennifer ? We 're not just gonna leave her here . Don 't worry . She 'll be safe . It 'll just be for a few minutes . Oh , Marty , be careful around that Griff character . He 's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants . The future .

Books used to have these to protect the covers . Of course that was before they had dust-repellent paper . And if you 're interested in dust , we have a quaint little piece from the 1 980s . It 's called a dustbuster . - Marty ! - I can 't lose . Marty , up here ! - Hey , Doc . What 's going on ? - Stand by . I 'll park over there .

Marty ! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here ? Yeah . Doc , listen . My kid showed up . All hell broke loose . Your kid ? Great Scott ! The sleep inducer . I was afraid of this . Because I used it on Jennifer , there wasn 't enough power ... to knock your son out for a full hour . - Damn ! - Doc , Doc , Doc , look at this ! It 's changing . I was framed ! Ah , yes ! Yes , of course . * Because this hoverboard incident has * * now occurred , Griff now goes to jail . * Therefore , your son won 't go with him tonight and that robbery will never take place . Thus , history , future history , has now been altered , and this is the proof ! . Marty , we 've succeeded , not exactly as I planned , but no matter . Let 's getJennifer and go home ! Hi , Einie . Hi , buddy . - What 's this ? - Uh , a souvenir . Fifty years of sports statistics . Hardly recreational reading material , Marty . Doc , what 's the harm in bringing back a little info on the future ? - Maybe we could place a couple of bets . - Marty ! I didn 't invent the time machine for financial gain . The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity- - where we 've been , where we 're going , the pitfalls , the possibilities , the perils and the promise . Perhaps even an answer to that universal question- - why ? Hey , Doc , I 'm all for that . But what 's wrong with making a few bucks on the side ? I am going to put this in the trash . Great Scott ! [ * Woman * ] * McFly , JenniferJane Parker , * 37 93 Oakhurst Street , Hilldale , age 47 . 47 ? That 's a hell of a good face-lift ! - What the hell are they doing ? - They used her thumbprint to assess her I.D. Since her thumbprint never changes over the years , they simply assume she 's theJennifer of the future . - We got to stop them . - We are we gonna say , that we 're time travelers ? - They 'd have us committed . - She 's clean . That means we take her home . Home ? To Hilldale ? It 'll be dark by the time we get out there . They 're taking her home , to your future home . We 'll arrive shortly thereafter , get her out of there and go back to 1 985 . You mean I 'm gonna see where I live ? I 'm gonna see myself as an old man ? No , no , Marty . That could result in- - [ Gasps ] Great Scott ! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self . The consequences of that could be disastrous . - Doc , what do you mean ? - I foresee two possibilities . One- - coming face-to-face with herself 30 years older ... would put her into shock , and she 'd simply pass out , or two--the encounter could create a time paradox , the results of which could cause a chain reaction ... that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum ... and destroy the entire universe ! Granted , that 's a worst-case scenario . The destruction might , in fact , be very localized , limited merely to our own galaxy . Well , that 's a relief . Let 's go . I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself . * The skyway 's jammed . * It 's gonna take us forever to get there . And this stays here . I didn 't invent the time machine to win at gambling . I invented the time machine to travel through time . I know . I know , Doc . So , Doc Brown invented a time machine . Hilldale . Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks , lobos and zipheads . Yeah , they ought to tear this whole place down . [ * Computer Voice * ] * Welcome home , Jennifer . * You all right ? You got a little tranked , but I think you can walk . Ma 'am , you should reprogram . It 's dangerous to enter without lights on . - Lights on ? - Yes . Now , look .

For a moment I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display . I thought it was following us . I can 't believe This window 's still broken .

What about all that stuff about humanity , where we 're going and why ? The risks are just too great , as this incident proves . And I was behaving responsibly . Imagine the danger if the time machine were to fall into the wrong hands . My only regret is that I 'll never get a chance ... to visit my favorite historical era , the Old West . But time traveling is just too dangerous . Better that I devote myself to study ... the other great mystery of the universe- - women . Marty , Einie , brace yourselves for temporal displacement .

[ * Sobbing * ] [ * Biff * ] * Always the little * * hothead , huh ? * You wanna take a poke at me ? * Damn it , Biff . * * That 's it . I 'm leaving . * Oh , ho-ho . So go ahead . But think about this , Lorraine . Who 's gonna pay for all your clothes , huh ? And your jewelry ? And your liquor ? Who 's gonna pay for your cosmetic surgery , Lorraine ? You were the one who wanted me to get these-these ... things . If you want ' em back , you can have ' em . * Look , Lorraine , * * you walk out that door , * and I won 't only cut off you , I 'll cut off your kids . - You wouldn 't . - * Oh , wouldn 't I ? * First your daughter Linda- - I 'll cancel all her credit cards . She can settle her debts with the bank all by herself . Your idiot son Dave- - I 'll get his probation revoked . And as for Marty- - well , maybe you 'd like to have all three of your kids behind bars , just like your brotherJoey . One big , happy jailbird family . All right , Biff , you win . I 'll stay . As for you , I 'll be back up here in an hour , so you better not be . He was right , and I was wrong . Mom ? Mom , what are you saying ? - You 're actually defending him ! - I had it coming . He 's my husband , and he takes care of all of us , and he deserves our respect . Respect ? Your husband ! How can he be your husband ? How could you leave Dad for him ? Leave Dad ? Marty , are you feeling all right ? No ! No , I 'm not feeling all right . I don 't understand one damn thing that 's going on around here ... and why nobody can give me a simple straight answer . Oh , they must have hit you over the head hard this time . Mom , I just wanna know one thing . Where 's my father ? Where 's George McFly ? Marty . George , your father , is in the same place he 's been for the past 1 2 years . - Oak Park Cemetery . - [ * Thunder Crashes * ] No . No . This can 't be happening . March 1 5 , 1 973 ? No ! Oh , please , God , no ! No , please , God . Please , God , no , this can 't be happening . This can 't be happening . This can 't be- - I 'm afraid it is happening , Marty , all of it . Doc . When I learned about your father , I figured you 'd come here . Then you know what happened to him ? You know what happened ... on March 1 5 , 1 973 ? Yes , Marty , I know . * I went to the public library to try * * to make sense out of all the madness . * * The place was boarded up , * * shut down , * - so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers . - I don 't get it , Doc . I mean , how can all this be happening ? It 's like we 're in hell or something . No , it 's Hill Valley , although I can 't imagine hell being much worse . - [ * Whimpering * ] - Oh , Einie . I 'm sorry , boy . The lab is an awful , awful , awful , awful mess . Attaboy . Obviously , the time continuum has been disrupted , creating this new temporal event sequence , resulting in this alternate reality . - English , Doc . - Here , here , here . Let me illustrate . Imagine ... that this line represents time . * Here 's the present , 1 985 , * * the future and the past . * Prior to this point in time , somewhere in the past , the time line skewed into this tangent , creating an alternate 1 985 . Alternate to you , me and Einstein , but reality for everyone else . Recognize this ? It 's the bag the sports book came in . I know because the receipt was still inside . I found them in the time machine . * Along with this . * It 's the top of Biff 's cane . I mean , old Biff , from the future . Correct . It was in the time machine ... because Biff was in the time machine with the sports almanac . - Holy shit . - You see , while we were in the future , Biff got the sports book , stole the time machine , went back in time ... and gave the book to himself at some point in the past . - Look . - [ Chuckles ] It says right here that Biff made his first million ... betting on a horse race in 1 958 . He wasn 't just lucky . He knew ... because he had all the race results in the sports almanac . That 's how he made his entire fortune . Look at his pocket with the magni * fy * ing glass . The almanac . The son of a bitch stole my idea . He must have been listening when I- - It 's my fault . The whole thing is my fault . If I hadn 't bought that damn book , - None of this would 've ever happened . - Well , that 's all in the past . - You mean the future . - Whatever . It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused ... and why the time machine must be destroyed ... after we straighten all of this out . Right . So we go back to the future ... and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine . We can 't because if we travel into the future from this point in time , it will be the future of this reality ... in which Biff is corrupt and powerful ... and married to your mother , and in which ... this has happened to me . [ Whimpers ] No . Our only chance to repair the present ... is in the past at the point where the time line skewed into this tangent . In order to put the universe back as we remember it ... and get back to our reality , we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances ... of how , where and when young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac . I 'll ask him . Bulletproof vest . Great flick ! Great freaking flick ! * The guy is brilliant . * * The guy is brilliant . * What the hell 's going- - Hey , you ! - * What the hell are you doing in here ? * - Party 's over , Biff . Sorry , ladies . How did you get past my security downstairs ? There 's a little matter we need to talk about . Yeah , money , right ? Well , forget it . No . Not money . * Grays Sports Almanac . * You heard him , girls . The party 's over . - Start talking , kid . - What else you know about that book ? First you tell me how you got it . How , where ... and when . All right . Take a seat . Sit down ! November 1 2 , 1 95 5 , that was when . November 1 2 , 1 95 5 ? That was the date I went back- - That ... was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm . You know your history . Very good . * I 'll never forget * * that Saturday . * I 'd just picked my car up from the shop 'cause I 'd rolled it in a drag race ... - * a few days earlier . * - I thought you crashed into a manure truck . How do you know about that ? My father told me about it . * Your father ? * Before he died . Oh , yeah , right . So there I was , minding my own business . This crazy old codger with a cane shows up . He says he 's my distant relative . I don 't see any resemblance . So he says , " How would you like to be rich ? " So I said , " Sure . " So he lays this book on me . He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event ... till the end of the century . All I have to do is bet on the winner , and I 'll never lose . So I say , " What 's the catch ? " He says , " No catch . Just keep it a secret . " After that he disappeared . I never saw him again . * Oh , and he told me * * one more thing . * He said , " Someday a crazy , wild-eyed scientist ... * " or a kid may show up * * asking about that book . * And if that ever happens- - " [ * Cocks Gun * ] * Funny . I never thought * * it would be you . * Biff , you 're forgetting one thing . What the hell is that ? You 're dead , you little son of a bitch ! [ * Bell Dings * ] - Hey , there he is ! - Hey , hey ! Go ahead , kid.Jump. - * A suicide will be nice and neat . * - What if I don 't ? Lead poisoning . What about the police , Biff ? They 're going to match up the bullet with that gun . Kid , I own the police ! Besides , they couldn 't match up the bullet that killed your old man . You son of a- - * I suppose * * it 's poetic justice . * two McFlys with the same gun . Idiot . What the hell ? Nice shot , Doc . You 're not gonna believe this . We gotta go back to 1 95 5 . I don 't believe it . * That 's right , Doc . * * November 1 2 , 1 955 . * Unbelievable that old Biff could have chosen that particular date . It could mean that that point in time inherently contains ... some sort of cosmic significance , almost as if it were the temporal junction point ... for the entire the space-time continuum . On the other hand , it could just be an amazing coincidence . [ * Beeping * ] Damn ! Gotta fix that thing . All right . Time circuit 's on . What do you mean , time circuit 's on ? Doc ! - We 're not going back now ? - * Yep . * What aboutJennifer ? What about Einstein ? - We can 't just leave them here . - * Don 't worry , Marty . * Assuming we succeed on our mission , this alternate 1 985 ... will be changed back into the real 1 985 , instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie . * Jennifer and Einie will be fine , * * and they will have absolutely * * no memory of this horrible place . * Doc , what if we don 't succeed ? We must succeed . Oh , this is heavy , Doc . I mean , it 's like I was just here yesterday . You were here yesterday , Marty , you were . Amazing , isn 't it ? All right . Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes . You go into town , and I 'll track down young Biff and tail him . Sometime today , old Biff will show up to give young Biff the almanac . Above all , you must not interfere with that event . We must let old Biff believe he 's succeeded so that he 'll leave 1 95 5 ... - and bring the DeLorean back to the future . - Right . Once old Biff is gone , grab the almanac any way that you can . Remember , both of our futures depend on this . You don 't have to remind me of that , Doc . Here 's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact . I 'll stay and try to repair the short in the time circuit . That way , we don 't risk anyone else stealing the time machine , and I won 't risk accidentally running into my other self . - Other self ? - Yes . There are now two of me here , and there are two of you here . The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1 95 5 , the other me that helps the other you get back to 1 985 . - Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower ? - Yeah . That event doesn 't happen until tonight , so you must be very careful ... not to run into your other self . Let me give you some money . [ Whistles ] Have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities . - Get yourself some ' 50s clothes . - Check , Doc . Something inconspicuous ! Doc . Come in . This is Marty . Over . * Roger , Marty . * * This is Doc . Are you there ? * * Yeah , Doc . * * I 'm at the address . * * It 's the only " Tannen " * * in the book , * but I don 't think this is Biff 's house . * It looks like * * some old lady lives here . * - [ * Woman * ] * Biff ! . * - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - * Where you goin ' , Biff ? . * - I 'm going to get my car , Grandma ! * When are you coming back ? * * My feet hurt and I want you * * to rub my toes some more ! * Shut up , you old bag . - * Give us our ball back . * - What ball ? - That ball ! - What ball are you talking about ? * Give us our ball back ! * What ball ? Is this your ball ? - * Yeah ! Yeah ! * - * You want it back ? * Well , go get it ! [ Laughs ] Doc , it is Biff 's house . I 'm on him . Over . * Mr. Sandman * * Bring me a dream * * Make her complexion * * like peaches and cream * - Hey ! - * Give her two lips * - Looking good . - Biff , she 's all fixed up just like new , but I couldn 't get her started . You got some kind of kill switch on this thing ? You gotta have the right touch . Nobody can start this car but me . - The bill comes to $ 302.57 . - Three hundred bucks ! Three hundred bucks for a couple of dents ? - Hey , that 's bullshit . - No , it was horseshit . * The whole car was full of it . * * I had to pay Old ManJones * * 80 bucks to haul it away . * [ * Biff * ] * Old ManJones * * probably resold it too . * * I oughta get something for that . * You wanna something for it ? We 'll go inside , you can call Old Man Jones , - if he wants to give you a refund , that 's fine . - It 's three hundred bucks ! If I catch the guy that caused this , I 'll break his neck . The manure . I remember that . [ * Bell Ringing * ] - Four cans of Valvoline . - Four cans for a $ 300 job ? - I couldn 't even have lunch in the shop . - I should get a case for $ 300 ! - It smells worse than the bathroom . - [ * Groaning * ] * The smell 's never gonna go away , Biff . * * Last time I do you a favor . * - Last time ! - [ Laughing ] Ohh ! * It 's so perfect , * * Lorraine . * * You 're going * * to look so good ! * Well , lookee what we have here . Nice dress , Lorraine , although I think you 'd look better wearing nothing at all . Biff , why don 't you take a long walk off a short pier ? * Listen , Lorraine , there 's * * that dance at school tonight . * * Right now that my car is all fixed , * * I fi * g * ured I 'd give you the honor ... * - of going with the best-looking guy in school . - I 'm busy . - Doin ' what ? - Washing my hair . That 's about as funny as a screen door on a battleship . Screen door on a submarine , you dork . Look , Biff , somebody already asked me to the dance . Who ? That bug , George McFly ? I 'm going with Calvin Klein , okay ? Calvin Klein ? No , it 's not okay . You 're going with me , understand ? - Get your cooties off me ! - When are you gonna get it through your thick skull ? - You 're my girl . - BiffTannen , I wouldn 't be your girl even if- - even if you had a million dollars ! [ Groans ] Yes , you will ! It 's you and me , Lorraine ! - [ Horn Honks ] - Watch it ! It 's meant to be ! I 'm going to marry you someday , Lorraine . Someday you 'll be my wife ! You always did have a way with women . Get the hell out of my car , old man ! You want to marry that girl ? I can help make it happen . Oh , yeah . Who are you , Miss Lonelyhearts ? Just get in the car , butthead . - Who you calling butthead , butthead ? - [ Engine Starts ] How did you know how to do that ? Nobody can start this car but me . Just get in the car , Tannen . Today 's your lucky day . [ Tires Squealing ] Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey , watch where you 're driving , old man ! If you dent this car , I 'll kill you . Oh , God . Oh . * This cost me 300 bucks ! * - Would you shut up about the car ? - And another thing , - how do you know where I live ? - Let 's just say we 're related . That being the case , I got a little present for you , something that 'll make you rich . - You want to be rich , don 't you ? - Oh , yeah . Sure . Right . That 's rich . You 're gonna make me rich ? You see this book ? This book tells the future . Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of this century- - football , baseball , horse races , boxing . The information in here is worth millions , - and I 'm giving it to you . - That 's very nice . Thank you very much . Now , why don 't you make like a tree and get out of here ? * It 's " leave , " you idiot . * * Make like a tree and leave . * You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong . All right , then !

He 's on his way to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance . Marty , listen , we may have to abort this entire plan . - It 's getting much too dangerous ! - Don 't worry . The book is on Biff 's dashboard . I 'll grab it as soon as we get to the school . Marty , you must be extremely careful not to run into your other self ! . - My other self ? - Yes ! Remember , your mother is at that exact same dance with you ! Yeah ! Right . This could get heavy , Doc . Heavy , heavy . Marty , whatever happens , you must not let your other self see you ! The consequences could be disastrous . - Excuse me , sir . - Yes , you with the hat . - Who , me ? - Yes . Be a pal and hand me a 5 / 8-inch wrench out of that toolbox . Five-eighths ?

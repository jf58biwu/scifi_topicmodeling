 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the Visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food . The Resistance is all that stands between us ... and the Visitors . Can I peel you another goldfish ? No . Thank you . I 've had my limit . - Of goldfish ? - What else ? Are you quite sure ? To the victor must go the spoils . And I do owe you for your performance this afternoon . Capturing my affections was a stroke of rare genius . Oh , this victor will have his laurels , Diana . Of that you can be certain . That 's the second thing that impressed me about you , James : Your ambition . Then , you should know my loyalty is yours as well , Diana . For that , you shall also be well-satisfied . So long as I remember the price you attach to any failure ? Oh , I love it when you talk of torture . But why bore each other with discussions of defeat ... when the real reason we are here is to celebrate success ? True . The moment of Slutor does approach . And once the Battlesphere reaches its programmed apogee ... those meddlesome peasants on Earth will be vanquished once and for all ... and you and I can meet our predestinies together . Together ? Do you truly mean that ? Darling , would I lie to you ? Do you believe me now ? Looks like the coast is clear . You 're a lot more trustworthy about Philip than I am . I know it 's a gut feeling . But that 's all I had to go on the first time I met Martin . It 's good you could come . I can 't stay long , but I had to speak with you . What 's up ? It isn 't easy for me to tell you this ... but I know it 's what Martin would do . The Leader is planning a blitzkrieg ... that will completely vanquish the Southwest . He 's decided to make it an example to others . A blitz ? Why haven 't we heard about this from other sources ? Because it 's top secret . The Leader 's computerized Battlesphere ... will become fully operational within 36 hours . And the onslaught will begin . What can we do ? There isn 't much time . But if I can manage to make a copy of the computer attack plan ... you might be able to break into the Battlesphere 's memory banks ... and throw it off . Use one computer to sabotage another ? That 's a pretty big order . Especially considering we don 't have a computer . There 's one at Science Frontiers that might work . Assuming we could break in , who 's going to work a computer that complex ? Julie 's not due back from the Fresno raid until next week . But we might be able to get Dr. Atkins . Who ? A professor who worked for my father . He was a heavyweight in the computer field before the Visitors blacklisted him . He 's a good man . Let 's give it a try . How soon can you get us the plan ? Meet me here , tomorrow at dawn . I have to go . There 's something about him . We can trust him . I don 't know . I 'd stake my life on it . Let 's find that Dr. Atkins of yours while we still can . Sergeant , that van there , check it out . I don 't want to leave any vehicles ... that might be commandeered by the Resistance . Yes , sir . Fellow crusaders ... this is a very special day . Not only are we celebrating Slutor , the annual perigee of our sunstar ... but also we rejoice today at the completion of our Battlesphere . With the Battlesphere finished ... the Leader will be able to transmit his own battle plan . Once it is implemented , Earth is ours . To final victory ! And now , as the Battlesphere is being installed in the control module ... I salute our commanding officer ... without whose presence none of this would have come to pass . It 's so exciting ! It is , Oswald . A failsafe plan for conquest on its way . James is even now eliminating the hacker on Earth ... who 's been interfering with our master computer . Well , la-di-dah ! I simply can 't wait for the war to be over . Colonization is such fun . You 're just drooling at the prospect ... of being able to run all your perverted little experiments on the humans . Well , naturally ! One wants to be able to practice one 's art . We 're called to the bridge . The Leader 's battle plan is coming through . James , you 're back early . We swept the entire area . All prisoners have been moved to containment area three . - And the computer ? - We did not find a computer per se . However , we did destroy several storefronts in the raid ... and I 've had the area monitored without a single report of further interference . But you have no proof ... that whoever 's been breaking into our war computer has been stopped . No certain proof . I 'm sure James has done all that could be done for the moment . I always try to do my best , sir . At whatever I undertake . Listen . The transmission has begun . There 's something from Earth interfering with our reception . - The transmission is unclear ? - Yes , sir . It 's as if someone has tapped into our master computer system . The hacker again ! So much for your sweep , Diana . I 've had my men ready for this . They 're taking a bearing right now on the source of the hacking . They will pinpoint his location exactly . With your permission ... Go . This time , we 'll have him , and he 'll never see us coming . Here you go . That 's $ 4 and $ 1 makes $ 5 . Thanks a lot . Stop by again . Have a nice day . What a stiff . - Henry , this is remarkable . - I wouldn 't go that far . Well , maybe . Hey , I learned from the best . We 're actually talking to the computer on board the Mother Ship . I know . Here , let me translate that for you . We 've got to notify the Resistance right away . Access to this information could be invaluable . - You really think so ? - Absolutely . Customer . Stay here . I don 't want to lose the connection . It 's cool , Dad . I can tap in whenever I want . Besides , you don 't really think you can run this store without me , do you ? Let 's go see who 's here . Hello , Doctor . Hi , Henry . Hi , Mrs. Butler . What can we do for you this morning ? I need a can of tuna . I was afraid of that . We 're still waiting for the shipment . - When do you think ... - Who 's to say ? The way the Visitors are cracking down , we may never get it . What do they expect us to eat ? Here . We 've been saving it for a special occasion . No , I couldn 't . Please . Take it . On the house . You 're very kind . Don 't let that get around . We 'll have the whole neighborhood in here . God bless you . Stay right here . Dad , what 's wrong ? The Visitors . They 're coming right this way . What are you waiting for ? No , Henry , I 'm not going with you . We can both hide out in ... No . Son , listen to me . It 's important that one of us lives , that some part of our family survives . Now go . Hide . If they take me , they won 't look for you . - Dad , that 's nuts . - Henry , go ! This is the area the signal was reported in . Deploy your men . Arrest all who resist . The computer must be found and destroyed , now . There 's no time . Do as I say ! Remember , I love you . Same here . Don 't resist . Hungry ? Go ahead . Take it . I 've got two . Check out this building . You 'll pay . I swear , you won 't get away with this . Yes ? Thank you . More bad news ? It 's Diana 's foolish insistence on letting James capture this hacker . - He 's been unsuccessful again ? - To say the least . Sooner or later ... such incompetence will begin to reflect on you , Lydia . Philip , as a specialist in legal affairs ... you should know better than anyone , Diana is not military attach√© . Her field decisions regarding Earth missions ... are absolute and inviolate . Find her for me ! Now ! Eenie , Meenie , Minie ... but I 'm afraid there 's no ' Moe . ' They are the best I could do under the circumstances . But obviously not good enough . Diana , on such short notice ... how was I to know you 'd be losing your fascination for ... Please , no names . Well , we both know who , don 't we ? I suppose one of these might do , in a pinch . Then , you are pleased ? Of course not . I 'm bored . As far as these feeble consorts are concerned ... they couldn 't be worth my time , much less my effort . I left word not to be disturbed . My apologies , Diana ... but Lydia and Philip request your presence on the bridge , immediately . Then I shall be there , posthaste . Have them scrubbed and oiled . I 'll make my choice later . Must you ? If you have to eat sweets ... at least have the courtesy not to smack your lips . Picky , picky . It 's a good thing I am . Look at this . Well ? One of the detainees from that unsuccessful sweep was a Dr. Atkins . A professor of psycho-cybernetics at Caltech University . If we 're still getting interference ... obviously he 's not the man we 're looking for . Unusual , then , that he would confess to the charges of computer tampering . Yes , quite unusual . I suggest we get Dr. Atkins up here for interrogation , at once . How gracious of you to agree to help us , Dr. Atkins . It 's refreshing to know that the spirit of volunteerism ... is still alive and well among your people . Why don 't we begin ? If you 'd be so kind as to show us how you 've gained access to our computers . Is there a problem , Doctor ? Please , if you 'll just let me concentrate . Of course . Surely you 're familiar with the operation of this equipment ? Perhaps you 're not guilty of the crime you confessed to . No , it was me . I 've been interfacing with your computers for months . You 're lying , Doctor . No , I 'm not . I 've broken your codes hundreds of times . The charade is over , Doctor . Now tell me who designed the program . You know the answer to my question , Doctor . I 'm privy to your most innermost thoughts . You have no secrets anymore . Who are you trying to protect ? I 'm growing impatient , Doctor . Who is it ? His son , the hacker . I 'll alert Lieutenant James at once . This is what happens to dissident scientists . First the lizards take away their jobs , then they go for the jugular . But it can 't be . I saw him just last month . This is very recent . I can feel it . An attack . A man , a boy ... The Visitors took the man away . Where ? I can 't tell . I think I can get in here . We should check it out . Go down and tell Willie to keep a sharp eye for Visitors . I 'll go around back . Freeze . Get ' em up . Who are you ? Drop it , Henry . I should have known you guys travel in pairs . - You know this kid ? - Meet Henry Atkins . Henry . We need to see your father . Good luck . What do you mean ? Where is he ? The Visitors came . He made me hide . They took him away . But it 's my fault . - What 's your fault ? - They came looking for me , not him . Why you ? Come on , I 'll show you . I 'll go get Willie and Elizabeth . A couple of weeks ago , I was working on something else ... when I stumbled onto the access code for the lizards ' main computer bank . You 've gotten into the Visitors' main computer ? Amazing . It took me a little while to figure out Visitorese ... but now it 's like second nature handling their symbols and codes . What are you doing ? I 'm not really sure , but it must be driving them nuts . What makes you think they even noticed ? They took my father . Don 't worry , Henry . We 'll get him back . Lizard patrol right on my tail . - What about Elizabeth and Willie ? - They got away . This time the they won 't leave empty-handed . We 've got to leave . - Is that portable ? - Absolutely . - Bring it . - Here they come ! I 'll lay down as much cover fire as I can . You and the kid run like hell . Are you crazy ? That 's suicide . Just get your computer and don 't give us any static . I don 't have to listen to you . You want to bet ? Take it easy . There 's another way out . - How ? - Watch . - Sharp kid . - Maybe too sharp . Hope you 're not afraid of the dark . Better get a move on . This is great . My dad 's locked up somewhere and you guys take a coffee break . Donovan 's out looking for him . Until he gets back , we lay low . I know it 's tough , Henry , but you 've got to be patient . Hey , I 'm thirsty . I 'll get you some juice . Forget it . You 're pretty good at these things . Any dope can play videos . It 's all just mechanics . You 've got to out-think the machine . Don 't get any ideas . I told you , I 'm not helping you guys until you get my dad back . I found him . Or where they 're holding him , anyway . My dad ? Where ? He 's been taken prisoner with the neighbors . In an abandoned maintenance shed near the Hansen Airfield . Now , don 't forget us . Just another night . Yeah , I tell you . I could sure get some more sleep . Willie , come here ! Okay , keep us covered out here . Okay , come on . It 's all right , everybody . We 're Resistance and you 've just been rescued . Let 's go . They should have been out by now . They 're coming . Here they come . Willie , get them out of here . Well ? Where is he ? We got everybody who was there . Yeah , everybody . Except my dad . This is the attack plan ... designed and personally transmitted by our Leader . You think I 'm setting a trap , don 't you ? If you are , you 've got a personal death wish . My only wish is to see an end to the bloodshed on this planet . To achieve that ... Diana , Lydia and their nest of vipers on the Mother Ship must be destroyed . I hoped that this delivery ... would convince you that I 'm committed to your cause . Our cause . Every facet of the invasion will be computer-controlled . The only way it can be stopped is by computer . This is an encoded map of the attack point coordinates ... and the relative size of the assault forces . The invasion will begin at noon today . Have you gotten access to a sophisticated computer system ? We can 't find Kyle 's friend . Do you know where Dr. Atkins is ? Yeah . Where ? He 's Diana 's prisoner on board the Mother Ship . What 's taking him ? He 's been in there forever . Finally . Fresh from another goof-up ? Drop it . What 's the matter ? The truth hurt ? - Did he know anything about his father ? - They 're holding him on the Mother Ship . Oh , that 's really excellent . Philip said he 'd do everything he can . You think I 'm gonna count on a lizard turncoat ? Look , you may not have any bright ideas about how to spring my dad , but I do . You 're not going anywhere . We 'll find your father , Henry . He was a loyal comrade and we 're not going to abandon him now . Look ... if I turn myself in , they 'll let him go . It 's not that simple . The game 's changed . We need your help , now . These are Visitor battle plans . Either we do something to sabotage them , or there 's no tomorrow . Don 't try to make me a hero . All I want is to see my dad again . Henry , listen to me . Your father sacrificed himself for you ... so you could carry on the fight . How do you know ? I know how proud he was of you ... and that he had great expectations for you . Don 't let him down . The Battlesphere has detected ... an unauthorized entry into its memory components . That 's impossible . I wish that were the case . This means the Fifth Column has stolen the Leader 's battle plan . You were in charge of security . We have no proof that the battle plan has fallen into enemy hands . The Leader 's plan has been compromised . I intend to notify him at once . I 'm afraid it 's far too late for that . Once the battle plan has been put into operation , it can 't be stopped . The computer will override any new input . We 're committed to the invasion . Irrevocably . Here 's the list of regional computer installations ... capable of interfering with the Battlesphere . Double the guards at each of these facilities . Right away . I 'll send James to the Science Frontiers Annex . It 's the closest and most likely target . Make sure he understands the importance of his mission . Where are the computers ? The top floor . How do we get up there ? There 's an elevator at the end of that hallway . Welcome , Mr. Donovan . We 've been expecting you . We 're trapped . Quick . There 's the elevator . The doors won 't shut ! It 's stuck . - The power 's gone . - What do we do now ? I don 't see what choice we have . Unreal . You men , come with me . You , stay here . How did she do that ? I 'll tell you about it when we get out of here . Elizabeth , can you send the elevator back down ? Yes . But why ? Just do it . These should stall them for a while . You guys get over to the hardware . Willie , come here . We 'll hold off James and his boys . This is incredible . Will you come on ? Let 's try in here . This one . Get moving . Go ! It 's the gray cord . I thought these units were compatible . They cut the power , remember ? Elizabeth ? Can you ... Just give it your best shot . Beautiful . Now that 's what I call juice . They 're launching . They 're underway . All right ! Perhaps you should have a look at this , Commander . What is it ? A report from internal security . It was filed early this morning . We 're attempting to identify the traitor ... responsible for the theft of the Leader 's battle plan . I commend your efforts ... but I 'm afraid it 's too little , too late . Nevertheless , the report makes for interesting reading . It seems that one of the sentries paid a visit to your quarters last night . I recall no such visit . Naturally . You weren 't present at the time . The very same time the battle plan was pilfered from the computer . Need I remind you that the commanding officer of a Mother Ship ... is not required to account for his whereabouts . Especially to his subordinates . Or are you suggesting that I 'm part of the Fifth Column ? Of course not , Commander . That would be grounds for our immediate court-martial . You 're not far from that now , Diana . The same goes for you . I 've already ordered a full inquiry ... into this blatant disregard for military procedure . The Leader will not be pleased . What pleases the Leader is victory , not indecision . We 'll see about that . Yes , I 'm sure we will . That 's it . I 'm in over my head . I can 't stop the attack . You can 't give up , Henry . - Why not ? You gave up on my dad . - It 's up to you , Henry . You can be a man now and forget your petty little snit ... or you can go on with your tantrum while all of us and the whole Southwest ... gets blown away forever . Come on . I really appreciate this , but who are you ? Never mind who I am . We 're with the Fifth Column . He 'll take you back to your son and the Resistance . I don 't know how I can thank you . You don 't have to , we 're on the same side . Now please , you must hurry . What are you doing ? I 've made contact with their Battlesphere . Now let me install my translation program for this system . Way to go ! Hold the applause . I haven 't found the battle plan yet . Here they come . - How many ? - Lots . Let 's toss these and fall back . Come on , let 's go . Come on . All right . Banzai ! I just tapped into their skyfighter guidance system . It looks like I can redirect their fighters just by talking to the Battlesphere . Give it a go . Let 's see what happens . Look there . Our fighter wing is being thrown completely off course . What 's going on ? There 's been a total breakdown of the guidance system . The plan ... It was supposed to be infallible . Philip was right . Isn 't there something you can do ? Don 't look at me . You 're the military genius . I told you I 'd make you pay . Next time , don 't mess with the kid . Did you see that move ? I took their TAC fighter right out of the air with one flick of the wrist . It 's showtime , lizards ! - How we doing ? - He patched into their guidance system . He 's got an entire fleet of skyfighters going around in circles . Take that , suckers ! - We gotta get out of here . - Henry , come on . - Just one more lick . - Now . This one 's for my dad ! Back to the woods . - Henry ! Over here . - Dad ! - You 've got quite a son . - Kyle , what happened ? Dr. Atkins , Henry just did you proud . He neutralized a massive alien attack by computer . Without him , we 'd have all been blown away . I wish I could take all the credit . The truth is it was a group effort . I don 't want to be a drag , but can we discuss all this somewhere else ? Transportation 's waiting . Thanks to the Visitor Fifth Column . Philip came through in the clutch . Tell him I 'm sorry . I 'll never doubt him again . Better luck next time . English

 Stop Right There ! Stop Right There And Surrender Your Weapon . Now You 'll See- - Ladies And Gentlemen , That Concludes The Film Portion Of Our Presentation . I 'm Sure You All Have Questions . So Let Me Introduce You To The Head Of Development For Secure-Tronics Unlimited- - Dr. Stan Simon . Thank You Very Much . Before I Open The Floor , I 'd Like You All To Meet Your Brand-New Security Team- - The Protector 101 Series Robots . One Week From Tonight At Closing , The Protectors Will Begin Their Patrol Of The Mall . Paul , They Look Like The Three Stooges . Each Assigned To One Of The Three Upper Shopping Levels . I Don 't Know , Mary , The One In The Middle Has An Unpleasantly Ethnic Quality . Now , Are There Any Questions ? Yes , Dr. Carrington . So What Do Your Machines There Do Besides Kill Criminals ? First Of All , The Protectors Do Not Kill . I Wonder If They Kill Cockroaches . They Could Probably Be Programmed To . And Merely Detain Intruders Until The Computer , Located On The Roof , Can Patch Into The Mall Phone System And Send The Alarm To The Police . I Don 't Know . That Guy Looked Awfully Dead To Me . Just Neutralized . Protectors Can Achieve This Function In A Number Of Ways . At Close Range , Sleep Darts Fired From Here And Here Can Knock A Man Out In Less Than 30 Seconds . However , The Likelihood Of An Intruder Gaining Entry Is Greatly Minimized By The Steel Security Doors Which Are Time-Locked From Midnight ' til Dawn . Um , They Seem So Violent . If They 're Called Protectors , What Do They Protect ? Plenty . For Starters , As Seen In The Film , The Protectors Do Their Work In The Mall Proper , Not In The Stores Themselves . Maybe We Could Use One At The Restaurant- - Get Rid Of People We Don 't Like . For Instance , Lasers Positioned Here Can Cut Through Any Sort Of Debris . Well , That 's All Very Well And Good , But What About Those Who Work Late ? How Can Your ... Things There Distinguish Between The Good Guys And The Bad Guys ? That 's Very Simple . Watch . This Is Simon . Bring Number One On-Line . Whoa ! Wow ! May I See Your Identification Badge , Please ? It 's Scanning . They Remind Me Of Your Mother . It 's The Laser Eyes . Thank You . Have A Nice Day . Same To You . There . You See ? The System Is Absolutely Foolproof . Now , Everyone Connected With The Mall Has Been Issued An I.D. Badge So That When The Mechanism Goes On-Line , The Protectors Will Make Park Plaza The Safest Mall In The State . Trust Me . Absolutely Nothing Can Go Wrong . Ow ! Are You All Right ? Coffee ? Come On , Sweetheart ! Give It To Me ! What Do You Got ? Andiamo ! Can I Get Two Uncle Luigi Bellybusters , A Double Anchovy Pizza And An Order Of Garlic Logs ? Gross . What Mojave Brain Ordered That ? Guy Over There . Oh , God . I Should 've Known . That Orca Beaches Here Every Night . Always Trying To Snag Some Skin . Play It Safe , Alison .

 [ shatters ] [ tires screeching ] [ tires screech ] [ music continues ] [ zapping ] [ shatters ] Oh , no . Not again . Eddie , when are you gonna stop with the scams ? Forget I asked . I 've had my quota of lies this morning . Ah , how can I help you , young lady ? I have an appointment with Lieutenant Harris . Oh , yeah . Here , put him in a holding cell . - You 're Lana Lang , right ? - Right . From the college ? You 're gonna do a number on us ? A paper for my poly psych class on police and community relations . Anyway , Lieutenant Harris had to go out . He said , he 'd be about half an hour . You can wait in his office if you like . Yeah , no . I think I 'll just take a walk , thanks . [ cooing ] [ dog barking ] [ dramatic music ] You picked a strange place to meet . Only because we 're friends , Slade . I didn 't want anybody to hear anything we don 't want them to hear . What are you talking about ? Talking about the shakedown racket you 're running , Slade . You and who knows how many other cops . Dirty cops . - You 're outta your mind . - Oh , come on . You got your hand in prostitution gambling , laundries .. There 's only one way to go . Turn yourself in and save the tax-payers some money . Hey , all I 've heard is talk . You never make it stick . Oh , no . I 'll make it stick alright . I 'll make it stick , Slade . The only way you 'll dodge hard time is by giving me the names of the others involved . You know me better than that , Harris . Listen to me , Slade . Listen to me . Co-operate . You can plea bargain . Maybe , get a year . Two at the most . I 'll put in a word with the DA . [ dramatic music ] Give me a day to think it over , okay ? Okay . [ man whistling ] Lana . [ gunshots ] Aah ! - Lana ! - Lieutenant Harris ! Aah ! Oh , my god . [ Harris coughing ] Dirty-dirty cops . Sergeant Coyle , headquarters . Trust him . [ tires screeching ] Get her ! [ intense music ] ( female # 1 ) We better get some help . ( male # 1 ) Is he still alive ? Operator ? Operator ? - Aah ! - Hey ! What do you think you 're doing ? [ door closing ] Second floor . [ music continues ] [ police siren ] Wait , Kinneran . We got her . [ music continues ] Find her . She can 't get far . And get Williams and Green down here , to help us . [ sighs ] Hey , where you been , Kemosabe ? You were supposed to drive Lana down to see Harris . I got hung up . Hung out to dry is more like it . Lana waited around as long as she could . She left a note for you somewhere . I saw it . Yeah , I want Willams and Green down here . Got the suspect cornered , but I 'm gonna need some backup . Um , operator ? Police headquarters . Hurry , please . Let me talk to a Sergeant Coyle . Yes , sure I know how the department feels . I 'm gonna get this cop-killer . ( man over radio ) Well , don 't The good news is , he 's still alive . What 's bad is , he 's given less than a 50-50 chance . Well , at least he 's got a chance . Saying a lot for a guy with three slugs in him . Where did you say he is ? [ phone ringing ] Yeah , who 's calling ? Sergeant Coyle , I was with Lieutenant Harris when he was shot . This is Sergeant Coyle . You say you saw Lieutenant Harris shot ? - Where are you now ? - I 'm at Staten and 4th . - Okay , don 't move . - No , I won 't move . I 'll stay right here . Hurry , please . I 'm scared . We 're on our way . Come on , Bebe . Don 't do this to me . It 's the rock stars that get all these backstage groupies . Not us lowly stand-up comics . [ flat tone ] All we ever get is .. Really ? Are you sure Vick wasn 't putting you on there ? Twins ? [ car honking ] No luck . Keep at it . Harrison , go completely under . Look , don 't worry . We got it handled . Okay , you betcha ' , Bebe . Tomorrow night , front row seat . Uh-huh . Yes ! Lana says she 's tired of being stood up . Says that I 'm no one she can depend on anymore . Her exact words . Whoa , that must 've been some letter , huh ? Ah , don 't worry , Clark . She 'll forgive you . - I mean , she always does , huh ? - I hope you 're right . Now , how did you manage that trick ? Construction on a new middle school will begin in the fall . Another cop shooting in Crescent County has left a police lieutenant unconscious and hospitalized . The officer was shot three times in the back this morning . The identity of the attempted killer is as yet unknown . [ phone ringing ] At this hour Detective Zeke Harris remains in a coma and in critical condition at Crescent County General Hospital . We 'll have more on that story , later on in the newscast . - Hello ? - Clark , it 's Lana . Was that weird about Harris , or what ? Are you at the hospital ? Tell him , we 're pulling for him . Harris is alive ? Oh , God . No , I-I-m not at the hospital . I 'm in a phone booth . I saw the whole thing , it was awful . Harris said that dirty cops did it . Lana , Lana , take a breath . Take a breath . You okay ? I am now . I called Sergeant Coyle . Harris said to trust him . He 's on his way down to pick me up now . Okay , good . Uh , we 'll meet you at police headquarters . [ machine gun firing ] [ tires screeching ] This is no time to drag your feet , Clark . Lana 's in trouble . I told you before , she 's okay now . It 's Lt. Harris that 's in trouble . I 'm sure he 's got the best doctors , Clark . It 's not the doctors , it 's those cops . I mean , they won 't let him come out of that coma . You go pick up Lana . I 'm gonna go to Crescent General . Well , there 's no way you can stand off killer cops . Power of the press , T.J. ? I mean , if I 'm at Lt. Harris' side nobody 'll make a move . Get going , man . Stakeout her dorm . Bug these friends of hers . Find her . Aah ! ( woman on P.A. ) Dr. Davis , telephone please . Still in here , eh ? Now , how 's he doin ' ? Not too good . He 's still in a coma . Look , why don 't you go take a coffee break or something and I 'll cover for you ? - Alright , thanks . - Sure , no problem . [ machine beeping ] This ought to make it look like a spasm . Ah ! We could do this the easy way or the hard way . [ gunshots ] [ machine beeping loudly ] He tried to pull the plug on Harris . You know any cops you can trust ? Get ' em down here . Keep someone at his side , at all times . Alright . [ machine stabilizes ] Take good care of him , Doctor . He 's a very special friend . [ door opening ] Well , somebody 's feeling better . - It 's Oscar , right ? - That 's right . You remember anything else ? You were very nice to me and you didn 't ask a lot of questions . - Thank you . - Oh , you 're welcome . Mm , hey , Oscar , do you have a phone ? Sure . Oh ... hold on , let me get it for you . Mm , thanks . Can I get you anything else ? Um ... directions ? ( Lana 's voice message ) After that last left , follow and you 'll see some car wrecks scattered around and you can 't miss it . And Clark , I know how worried you and T.J. must be but this person who 's helping me is just wonderful and I 'd like you to meet him . So , hurry , Clark . I miss you . - Wanna hear it again ? - No , I got it . Stay put in case Kent or his roommate show up tonight . So she 's taken up with some ex-hippie 50 miles off the interstate . Perfect . Just perfect . You made a difference , Oscar . Your generation managed to leave its mark in so many ways . [ chuckles ] Well , so will yours , Lana . At your age it 's all ahead of you . Ah , this is the berth we stood in . [ dramatic music ] Trouble . We 're pickin ' up somebody in Kent 's room . ( Lana 's recorded message ) 'Hurry , Clark . I miss you . ' I asked Clark if I could stop by . I hope you don 't mind . No , anytime , Superboy . What 's the scoop ? How is Lana ? We went out of our skulls when she wasn 't at the station . She 's alright . I know where she is . But so do the bad cops . There was a second click on that message . [ soft thud ] Those damn raccoons . - Save our place . - Okay . [ Oscar grunting ] Run , Lana , run ! [ gunshots ] [ tires deflating ] Alright , Superboy , way to go . Oscar ! Run , Lana ! [ tires screeching ] [ intense music ] Just like the other day , Lana . Just you and me . [ grunts ] I wish I had killed you then . You 're gonna beg me to kill you now . [ theme music ] [ grunts ] Oscar . Thanks , Superboy . Thank you , Oscar . Ugh . Well , the doctors say , another week and you 'll be back on the street , Lieutenant . Ah , the streets . That 's where I belong . Where a man can eat a hot dog for lunch in peace . Did you come through for me , T.J. ? Look out for the nurse . I 'll see you later , Lieutenant . - Bye , T.J. - Bye-bye . T.J .. Lana ? I 'm sorry about the other morning and I-I really screwed up . What else is new ? I mean , I could 've helped . You ? Against all those killers ? Right . Where you going now ? I still got my poly psych paper to finish . I 'm going to the library . You , uh , mind if I come along ? It sounds like a good idea . Well , if you 're sure you have nothing better to do . Captioned by Grant Brown

IT SAID , " IT DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT , " AND THAT 'S MADE ME THINK , VERY CAREFULLY , ABOUT WHAT I 'VE BEEN FEELING AND WHY . I 'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THE SHEER PROCESS OF BEING TAKEN APART , OUT OF BODY , AND PUT BACK TOGETHER , AGAIN ... WHY , IT 'S LIKE COFFEE BEING PUT THROUGH A FILTER . IT 'S SOMEHOW , A PURIFYING PROCESS . IT 'S PURIFIED ME , IT 'S CLEANSED ME , AND I 'LL TELL YA , I THINK IT 'S GOING TO ALLOW ME TO REALIZE ... THE PERSONAL POTENTIAL I 'VE BEEN NEGLECTING , ALL THESE YEARS-- - THAT I 'VE BEEN OBSESSIVELY PURSUING , GOAL AFTER GOAL . DO YOU NORMALLY TAKE COFFEE WITH YOUR SUGAR ? WHAT ? YOU KNOW , I-I JUST DON 'T THINK I 'VE EVER GIVEN ME A CHANCE TO BE ME .

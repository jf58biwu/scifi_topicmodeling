I 'll call you right back . Dr. Nielsen , where are you ? My monitor shows a stat condition . Dr. Nielsen , can you hear me ? Paging Dr. Nielsen . Hang on , everyone .

Get us out of here , Tom . Do you know anything about the pumps ? Sure do . All right . Let 's go . Not running . I 've complained to Nielsen for months about these things . The fluid builds up and bingo , we have an alarm . Excuse me . Joanie ? Schmidt again . Good news . I found the problem and there is no biohazard . It was a false alarm . You can unlock the doors and let everyone go home . You wanna come in , Tom ? I 'd rather not open the door . We have a good seal and the rules- - I don 't wanna come in . I wanna get out . Joanie , put me through to Dr. Nielsen . I 'm trying , but I don 't get an answer from P4 . I 'll try an outside line . Won 't work . Normal phone service was cut the second you pushed that button . It was ? Why ? I 'll explain later . Meanwhile , rescind that alert . This is a non-event event . Gee , I don 't know , Mr. Schmidt it 's all over my screens . The procedures are pretty explicit . You trained me yourself . Joanie , calm down . This is not your fault . You did the right thing . I want you to restore us to normal operations before people get scared . I don 't wanna make a mistake . Will you take responsibility ? Yes , of course . I take full responsibility . Attention , security ! This is Dr. Nielsen in P4 . Do you show a biohazard condition ? Yes , sir , I do . Aerosol contamination . Seal the building . No one in or out . I 've done it . This is not a drill . We 've had an accident . Mr. Schmidt says this is a false alarm . I don 't care what Schmidt said this is my shop . You do what I tell you . Open your safe and follow those instructions . You have reached a toxicological control facility . If action protocol one is now in effect , press right square bracket , return . Major Connolly . This is operator 7 at station 775 . Um , this is to confirm a protocol one as of 5 : 09 mountain time this date . I see the board . Are you locked good and down tight ? Yes . Anybody clock out ? Uh , I counted three people . Have your local authorities find them . I want them detained . How serious is this ? Holy shit . Full symptomatic manifestation in under an hour . Okay , everybody . Line up here . Quietly and calmly . One by one . Wait a minute , please . You propose to shoot this stuff into my arm ? Fairchild 's magic elixir . I don 't see any other way , Ramesh . But that 's a completely unproven antitoxin . You have no right to go experimenting . One . This is no experiment . We 're in protocol . Do you wanna go to protocol two ? You want me to unzip . I am not coming out of this suit . You already unzipped for the photo , remember ? Yes , but ... I feel fine . What are you talking about ? We 're already infected . Lactobacillus Luminensis . It 's reached your sweat glands . Now me . Hey , open up in there ! Western Union . I can 't put 'em in jail , hon they 're not criminals . They made a mistake . We could sue 'em . You wanna ? Civil law ? Make a case for corporate negligence . You know , unsafe workplace . Cold chicken . Something happened in the P4 lab , Cal . Look , remember Dan Fairchild ? Yeah , sure I do , I guess . He used to work here . I liked him . You should talk to him . Honey , Fairchild 's not reliable . He 's a drunk . I heard he got fired . Forget him . Uh-oh . Somebody 's got a popgun . I 'll call you right back . Yeah ! One more ought to do it ! All right ! Watch it . Hey . Want me to go get my torch ? Nobody 's gettin ' anything . Vic , you ought to know better . Hand it over . Well , well . It 's our duly elected boy scout . I 'm talking about the gun . Let 's have it . You dippy shit , my son 's in there . Drop it or I 'll break your arm ! Oh ! It 's getting late out here , Sheriff . Just what the hell are you doing about all this ? The local ally is right over there ! Sheriff Morse , I 'm Major Connolly . Where are my three sorties ? Uh , my deputy 's bringing in warren and main right now . Dana is right over there . Who are you guys ? The army ? Close enough . I 'm glad to see you 've got everything under control . Well , folks here would like an explanation . So would I. It says here in the report that you were raised in the True Redeemer Baptist Church . I understand that your wife is inside . You might wanna say a prayer too . I 'm not a religious man , Major . I see . Miss Evans , let me assure you there is no cause for alarm . this is standard containment procedure to be used in instances of this kind . Would you put your foot here , please ? Thank you . Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , what did I do ? All right . If you 'll come this way now . That 's fine . Friends , I am from the U.S. Accident Containment Team . Let me begin by first apologizing to you , Miss Evans , and everyone else , uh , not only for the lateness of the hour , but for the inconvenience and the worry that you 've all been put through . As you know , Biotek is leading a revolution in agriculture . We 've all heard the magic word " Genetic Engineering . " Well , in a few short years , we may have ourselves a whole new kind of farm . Corn that doesn 't need fertilizer , cattle that fatten themselves . On the other hand , with any new technology , there are certain risks . And earlier today , someone spilled a batch of experimental yeast . Now no one got hurt . But if we open those doors prematurely , before proper cleanup can be done , then we endanger the herds and crops that you already have . And that would mean an economic catastrophe . Hey . What 's with the men from glad ? I presume that you 're referring to our mobile quarantine package . It 's a temporary measure for her protection and yours . Sorry it took so long , but we had to talk a blue streak And they 're still hoppin ' mad . Jesse . These are the people who got out early , huh ? Say , quite a party going on here . Sheriff , would you mind lending me some of your deputies ? A little local presence wouldn 't hurt . Take 'em . Congratulations , Grazio . You 're a fed . That was quite a speech you made . Oh , the yeast story ? The whole scenario 's part of the same protocol Your wife instituted when she pushed that button . - Scenario ? - Honey , are you there ? Cal , are you there ? Yes . Where are you ? I took a walk down the hall . I decided to lock my door . What 's the matter ? Is that your wife ? May I speak to her ? Mrs. Morse , I 'm Major Connolly . I 'm right outside the building . Would you put me through to Dr. Nielsen ? I 'm sorry , sir . I haven 't heard a thing from P4 for hours . We have a picture . Uh , sit tight , Mrs. Morse . Well , uh , she sounds okay . Uh , that 's a good sign . We 're all set , but don 't really have troop superiority . Just a squad to show the uniform . I haven 't got P4 , but here 's the cafeteria . Real forces in Colorado , 48 hours away . Let 's hope we don 't need anybody . I 'm sorry , sir . No unauthorized entry . You can 't be that dumb , Grazio or I never would 've hired you . Do your head count later . Show me the corridor outside P2 . P2 . P2 . Here it goes . Can you pan ? Not this camera . Damn it . Where 's Schmidt ? P4 's coming through . I don 't get it . Where is everyone ? Maybe they got out before the alarm . Hey , they left their helmets . There they are , asleep on the floor . Tilt down . Zoom in . God Almighty , that 's Nielsen . Who else ? That 's Kapoor there by the airlock . What happened , Major ? How 'd you get in here ? I walked in . Sheriff , can we have our little chats outside , please ? Just a minute . I 'm the civil authority in this county . I know . This is government property . Kill the screens ! You 've got fatalities there , Major . Don 't tell me about yeast . You 're jumping to conclusions . I saw it ! You saw it . Who are you trying to protect ? Everybody . You , me , your wife , the public . And you didn 't see a thing , you understand ? Major Connolly , it 's Schmidt . He found a phone in stairwell five . That you , Connolly ? You brought in the whole shooting match . You never bothered to speak to me . We had a pump malfunction . I fixed it hours ago . This quarantine is a crock . Slow down , schmidt . We 're in for the long haul . Protocol one has been validated . Validated ? How many dead ? Five , six , seven , eight . It looks like everybody , but I can 't control the cameras in P4 . I can 't see everything . What do you think ? Any movement ? You wanna know are they dead ? Yes . No ! I can 't tell . This guy , Fairchild , where can I find him ? I understand he and his wife rented that property up in the basin , north of Heaterville . Right . Thanks . I 'll look him up . Maybe they 're just really sick or in a coma or something . Okay , listen . Now turn that picture off . Nobody 's sick . There 's been an industrial accident , that 's all . What kind of accident , Cal ? That was the Blue Harvest group . What were they doing in there ? Look , honey , I don 't know . Advance plant research . I mean , what if they spliced the wrong gene ? You mean the corn that ate Chicago ? Do I sound panicky ? I 'm sorry . I 'm scared . Let 's go , pal . Rise and shine . What the hell are you doing here ? Cal Morse . Remember me ? Yeah . Look , I don 't need a ride home Sheriff . I 'm already here . Did somebody spill something ? That 's what they 're saying . Experimental yeast . Yeast ? Who 's talking about yeast ? Is there a guy named ed Connolly there ? That 's right . And a whole team of army men . That 's typical . Well , I hope he brought his lysol . Here . No way , Sheriff . I 'm not going down . I saved you from a lot of drunk driving charges . Don 't you think you owe me one ? I don 't drink anymore . And you know why ? ' Cause I got worried about my health , which is also why I left Biotek . I don 't have any plans to go back . Want some Zucchini pancakes ? I 'm a terrific cook . I bet . Come on , guys . You gotta feed millions . Where 's your wife ? Oh , she moved on . She didn 't enjoy Hydroponics . Look at this . I 'm growing bacteria to beef up the vegetable protein . I think I 'll skip breakfast , thanks . What 's the matter , Sheriff ? Scared of bugs ? No . Lost my appetite . I started thinking about friends and neighbors who don 't have any idea who it is they 've been working for . Oh , the department of defense isn 't so bad . They run a good plant station . I kind of miss it sometimes . Up . All that fancy greenhouse crap 's just your lousy cover - you never touched a leaf while you were there . Nope . But I got inspired . You have some coffee . I grew the chicory myself . Blue Harvest Project ? We hear you 're trying to grow corn in salt water . But that 's not it , is it ? You son of a bitch . It 's germ warfare . Biological warfare research was outlawed by international treaty in 1972 . Soviet union signed it , and so did we . You 're not saying Uncle Sam doesn 't live up to his international obligations , are you ? Listen , my friend . There a re 85 people trapped down there . Trapped in your mess . You 're going to help me get them out . Not me . Nielsen did the human tissue work . I gave him a cure . You just make sure Connolly inoculates everyone . You don 't understand . My wife 's in there . Bob ? Find me a scanner , please . Here 's one , Mr. Schmidt . Good . Let 's take a look . You first . Two , four , six , eight . I don 't wanna radiate . All right . Now you , Tippett . Come on , Schmidt . You gonna do everybody ? We 're all fine . Let 's go . Don 't be an ass . We have to be sure . We can 't troop out trailing bugs . Give me your hands . I thought you were hot to trot . What do you wanna do ? Go down to P4 and ask 'em to hand over the antitoxin ? No . Now me . Bob , you do the honors . What do I look for ? Check around my eyes , nose , mouth , fingernails . Anything that glows is an infection . Now use your best judgment , but find and administer the antitoxin . Remember , the bug is virulent . Eighty percent mortality rate . Get to P4 . You may encounter hostiles . You want me to shoot ? If they endanger the mission , yes . Stay in contact . I don 't want you coming out with the wrong test tube . Hello , Major . Having fun ? - Did you bring him down here ? - Yes , sir , I did . He 's a doctor . I wanted a second opinion . Please keep your opinions to yourself . Think I 'd be violating national security if I told you . You 're tunneling through the wrong wall ? Save it . I 'm going in there to keep the wind at my back . You 'll run into a lot of people I know a safer way to get to Nielsen . Nielsen is dead . Okay , Walston , take them in . How 'd you come to pick our little town for this kind of work ? These people would kill you if they knew how 'd you been risking their lives . There was 38 % unemployment here . I think they 'd be proud as hell . Sheriff , why are you limping ? I had polio . I knew you had a thing about germs . No , I don 't . I just don 't think we got any business fighting wars with them ! It 's called deterrence in kind . What , you want us to start a nuclear holocaust if the soviets infect us ? We need the proper reply . Mount up , guys . It 's time for the cavalry to rescue the wagon train . Joanie ? Joanie ? Joanie ? Yes ? It 's me , tom . Um , there 's a group of us here and more in the cafeteria . We 've just done a U.V. scan and there 's no problem . Oh , thank God . Amen . Now , the point is , there 's a lot of healthy people being kept in here by bureaucratic rules written long ago and far away . Mr. Schmidt , you 're not gonna ask me to open up the building ? Not P4 . I understand it 's- - it 's a wipeout in there . I can 't do it . You 'll have to speak to Major Connolly . To hell with Connolly ! Joanie , look , you don 't wanna push the button . Fine . Just tell me the code . You can testify against me at my trial . I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm not gonna give you the gate sequence until I have outside authorization . Let me in , Joanie . You can say I-I-I overpowered you because that is exactly what 's going to happen ! Get back out of here ! I don 't wanna shoot anyone . Joanie , Joanie , Joanie , listen to me , listen to me . You don 't have to say a word . Just show me your daybook . Here it is . You stupid cow ! You burned the page , but you remember the numbers , don 't you ? I 'm not telling you anything ! Joanie , we don 't have time to be nice . She 'll talk . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! This is getting out of hand ! No ! No ! I know you 're frightened , but we all want to get going . Jesus Christ , Tippett ! It 's just my way of saying " please . " Now , look , you 're killing us . Don 't you understand ? No ! G44 , 8 over 5 . Esac calling Marilyn on channel 2490 . Note , we 've launched D-Con party . Torch . Security , this is Sheriff Morse . Do you read me ? Come in , Joanie . Where are you , Joanie ? Here you go , Bob . Here you go . Drink this . Some case of bad breath , huh ? Just give me a minute . Give me a couple tylenols , I 'm as good as new . Will you quit playing doctor ? He 's got it , Schmidt . Any fool can see that . Jesus ! Hey , everybody , they 're here ! They 're cutting through the admin door . Hold it , hold it , hold it ! If Bob is sick , we can 't take a chance . Rates of infection can vary . We could all have it right now . What 's the matter , Schmidt ? I feel fine ! Get out of the way ! Come on , follow me ! Hurry up , get through there ! Three abreast , stay together , no talking . Hold it ! Do not let them through ! Hold 'em ! Out of the way , boy ! Marilyn , this is Esac . We have a casualty . Tippett . Maybe you heard what happened in there . You said you might be able to help . Sure . You , come with us . Let 's move it ! Keep moving . You are all under arrest . I want everyone seated and remain seated until further notified . It looks like D-Con team is back in security . Uh , probe to base . Where the hell am I ? I 've got four corridors leading out of here . You 're in security . When you leave there , bear left . And stay out of zone " U " . It 's likely to be crowded . I 'm gonna take you down the service conduit . No one ever goes in there . If you say so . I , uh- - I don 't like the looks of this . Y 'all keep in contact , ya hear ? You sure you wanna put 'em through there ? Are you gonna second guess me already ? No , but that 's a tight spot . Not much room for maneuvering . Mr. Schmidt . Joanie . Joanie , did they hurt you ? Oh , Joanie , it was my fault . You were right . Protocol one . We 're all dying , Joanie , except you . What happened , Mr. Schmidt ? What went wrong ? Major Connolly , you wanna come over here ? Yes , what is it ? I 've got P4 he re on the sweep . We 've been checking it every 30 minutes . So you have . It looks quiet . It ought to . They 're all supposed to be dead , right ? Yeah . So where are they ? There were stiffs all over the floor . Damn it . They 've been moved . Tilt up to the door . That 's the end of that seal . The whole building 's been contaminated . Somebody 's been in there and pulled out a dozen bodies . I don 't know . That door looks like it was broken from the inside . - What was that ? - Zoom in . Would you look at that guy 's hand . Oh , no . It 's awfully bright in here , Ramesh . It hurts my eyes . That 's easily overcome , sir . Made image in ten seconds . Walston , can you hear me ? Yeah , I hear ya . What the hell happened in here ? It 's dark as a coal mine . Somebody pulled the mains . Uh-huh . Why don 't I come back out there and we 'll talk about it . No . Use your suit lights . You still got a long way to go . All right , that 's better . Here come the backups . Let 's go . Going to red . Look ahead now . The next door you come to should be the P4 complex . I don 't see any door , but here goes . Hold it . Hello ! Glad to see you ! Get on down here . Who the hell is that ? Be careful , Walston . I thought we weren 't supposed to meet anyone here . You there , identify yourself , please . It 's me , Dr. Nielsen . give me the logbook . Got a good picture . That looks like Nielsen , alive . Fantastic ! I knew it would take more than a germ to punch his ticket . Looks like your medicine works . Listen to me , Walston . Back up ... Nice and slow . Don 't talk to him and don 't run . What about the antitoxin ? Isn 't he supposed to be our man ? We 'll discuss it later . Now move . Oh , Jesus . You 'll be all right . Take it easy . You 're gonna be okay . Ow ! Get off me ! Oh , my God . Walston , can you hear me ? Connolly calling Walston . Is anyone there ? D-Con team , answer me , someone ! Marilyn , this is Esac . We have lost the D-Con mission . Eight casualties . Yes , sir . Presumed dead . Fairchild , you stupid son of a bitch . You led them into an ambush . We have an I.D. on one Dr. Kapoor Who was known to be in the P4 contaminant area . Joanie ? Joanie , where are you ? I 'm right here . We 're not safe in here . Get that door open . Safe from what ? Where can we go ? P4 lab . There 's an antitoxin in there . No ! Come on , Mr. Schmidt . We can do it . I have an announcement . The decontamination teams have confirmed cases .. of low-level human infection . Have any of us been exposed to some kind of disease ? Absolutely not . The , uh , quarantine has been 100 % effective . Seen the headlines ? Let me point out that emergency food and water supplies have been located throughout the building . Fake the lie , and the media is falling right into step . The truth will come out ... When the survivors do . Nobody 's coming out . Listen to the man . This is a dark hour . But there is something that you can do . Ask the creator for his divine assistance and pray for your loved ones . It 's protocol two . That 's his way of making the announcement . Seal the building and let the disease run its course . Why don 't you quit with the double-talk . I want my boy back out of there ! There will be no further comments at this time . Wait a minute . Be seeing you , Sheriff . You don 't need me anymore . Connolly , is that you ? What the hell is going on ? We 've been in here for hours . Where 's that rescue team I heard about ? Come on ! Get in here while you can still do some good ! It 's not fair , you bastards . God ! Joanie ! Doctor , let us in . Open the door . I can 't do that . You know the protocols . I 'm not sick ! You look pretty good , but I don 't know about Tom . I have to say no . There 's a lot of people in here . Please ! Please ! No . Good luck to you , Joanie . What did she say ? What are they gonna do ? Does everyone feel okay ? Any headaches , sore throats or fever ? Shh , shh . Mr. Schmidt , look . What 's that ? I can 't see . I don 't think we should go down there . Why not , Joanie ? Dr. Nielsen ! Very much alive , despite what they told you . You 're sick . I was , for a moment . But not anymore . Hello , Tom . Don 't worry . You 'll recover , just like the rest of us . Here , let me give you a hand . Kapoor is right down this way . No ! Don 't take me , Joanie ! Don 't let them ! Dr. Nielsen , it 's okay . We 're not alone anymore . Look at my clothes ! Blood all over them . Do you think this will wash out ? What 's the blood from ? I don 't want outsiders coming in here . They mustn 't see what happened . It 's very shocking . Who mustn 't see ? Ask ramesh . I feel rage , Joanie ! Beautiful rage ! Joanie . Joanie . Help me , Joanie . Okay , okay . Okay , okay . Cal ? Cal ? Where are you , cal ? How would you have told these folks , Sheriff , that your fathers and brothers are infectious psychotics , it 's all over and in less than 12 hours they 'll be dead ? Major , I 'm going in there . I 'll find the antitoxin . I 'll administer it . You can lock me in . The antitoxin doesn 't work ! I know you 're a husband . I know exactly what 's going through your mind . But you 're also a law enforcement official , and this a major civic disaster , like a flood or an air crash . You gotta set your emotions aside and act like a professional ! Hey ! Get back . Get back out of my way . Oh , no . Stay away . Get out of the car , asshole . Get this man away from the building . Cal , where are you ? What is it ? Joanie , can you hear me ? You all right ? Yes . I mean , no . They smashed everything . What about you ? I think they 're after me because they know I 'm not sick . I 'm sorry , Sheriff . There 's nothing I can do . Hey ! Do you think you can just walk away from this ? I want you to talk to my wife . She 's not sick ! Has she been exposed ? Yes , and she 's healthy . It 's not a disease this is a weapon of war . it 's designed to produce casualties , but it 's also designed to promote maximum tactical confusion . What are you saying ? It drives people crazy , that 's what I 'm saying ! Soldiers turn on their comrades . Civilian victims murder their doctors . And then they die . And that 's what 's going on in that building right now . I don 't believe it . This is deliberate ? You saw Nielsen and you saw what he 's done . He 's a victim of his own bug . A regular Dr. Frankenstein . You worked on this ! Hell no . I designed the cure . You knew about it ! Well , I knew that they were trying , but I didn 't think that they could do it . I guess I should have had more faith in the ingenuity of my fellow man . Turns out it 's a big success . You think I need this ? Well , I don 't . You 're right . I am a technocrat . I allowed myself to be used and I am as guilty as all the rest of them . Joanie , this is dan Fairchild . I want you to tell me what 's going through your mind now ? I mean , do you feel like hurting people ? You bet I do . Nielsen , Kapoor , the rest of them . I 'd like to kill them . Don 't worry . It 's a perfectly healthy urge . I 'm not infected . I already checked . And even if I was , it wouldn 't make me a mad woman . Okay . We need to know exactly where you are . P4 , Nielsen 's lab . I 'm in the stockroom . Do you see a refrigerator there ? It 's full of bottles . The one 's with the orange flag are the antitoxin . Are you safe ? Can you stay put ? I think so . Where 's Cal ? Okay , you wait right there . Don 't move , not for anything . You were right . She 's not sick . She might be the key . I have been an employee in the feed and seed department for two years . I met Bob- - he 's the one who 's trapped in there- - We met on the job and we 're saving up to get married . How long will you have to remain in quarantine ? Well , I 'm fine , but the officer said 48 hours . That 's two whole days in saran wrap . How do you feel about Biotek now ? It 's a real good company . The pay is good , benefits are good . And guess what . I 'm on overtime . Hey . What 's new , huh , Sheriff ? Hey . You 're not talking ? You still on their side ? Hey . Now break it up ! What 's the matter with you ? Hey . White sugar , white dust . That 's a body bag . Sorry . I 'm looking for suits . You look like a 40 to me . Are you gonna be okay ? How reliable is this suit ? 100 % . What about the air ? Am I gonna have to hold my breath for two hours ? Hey . You 're gonna be surrounded by germs and sick people . You sure that you can handle this ? Yeah , sure . You bet . Wait . I 'll show you how the pros do it . This corn 's been eating its wheaties . What 'd you expect ? We 've got the best feed grain group in the country . This is an air shaft . Are you gonna open that up ? What 's gonna come out ? Nothing . Look . It 's an intake . Excuse me , Major . We 've got an external seal break . Where ? The greenhouse . The air intake . You 're shitting me . Watch yourself . Slippery going here . Slippery going . Right . All right , soldiers , fall in . Follow me . The first person to enter P4 without a security clearance . Hey , where are you ? I can 't do it . But you 've got the suit on . Get on down here ! Let 's go ! It 's different for you . - Germs are your job . - Hold it ! You ! Stay where you are ! Some protocol we got here . Caps on the bottle , sir . You ever hear of Borna ? You mean like " born again " ? No . It 's a small town in East Germany . There were some horses there - - this was before the war- - who were attacking each other and everything around them until they dropped . It was worse than rabies . Well , it turns out they had caught a hither to unknown virus , that was infecting the rage center of the brain , The Rhine Encephalon . You hear that ? It 's getting louder . You know the Borna Virus is hard to catch . It 's no good as a weapon . And what Nielsen did was to take the deadly part of the viral genome , and move it into a nice , highly infectious bacterial vector . You mean a germ ? Exactly . I think we should put him up for the nobel prize . Don 't laugh . He 's the best kimeric gene splicer on the planet . Careful . Now you watch where you point that thing . Okay , let 's do it . It 's Bob Nickerson . He was . He 's dead . It 's interesting , isn 't it ? Wish we could do an autopsy . There 's an idea . I 'm dying . You are not going to die . I 've got the stuff . I just - - I need a syringe . It 's going to be terrible . You 've got to leave . There 's nowhere left to go . She 's there . This way . I saw her . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . I just saw them and they saw me . So , let 's just pray that this stuff does some good . Mr. Schmidt . I warned you ! The toxin is in here ! Right there ! Up the stairs ! Joanie ! Cal ! Thank god . I wanna get out of here . The antitoxin ! We got it . Get him ! It 's them . Let 's go . Get the toxin ! No . No , no . Get him . Get him ! Don 't let him get away . This way . It won 't work ! I jammed it . Look at this ! I 've been wondering how the bud got out of this lab . Even after the primary infection , it should have stayed in here . But I guess every epidemic has its typhoid mary , and I think I 've just found ours . Sure , he took a shower , he changed his clothes , he took all the precautions . But the bastard was wearing contact lenses . And he left here and toured the entire building . The busy administrator on his rounds . Don 't worry , Sheriff . He won 't bite ya . Well , Jesus Christ ! Would you look at that ! Goddamn protection . No one 's supposed to survive a direct attack from Nielsen 's best weapon .

 ( chanting ) Shunda . Shunda . Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda . Well east coast girls are hip I really dig those styles they wear hah hah Those wild and crazy scientific guys — I love ' em those Misfits ... Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! you guys shouldn 't have sedated him like this . he belongs somewhere else . but not here . look at this guy . He 's a primitive . do you know what this is ? a business card . It 's nice . to be exact . it 's all set . can we take him right now ? no problem . let 's roll . Come on . purveyors of very weird science . no . one of ' em has to be right-side-up or it 's not gonna work . Dick : I-is this your idea of a hundred and forty-three dollar joke ? it 's our idea of truth in advertising . it 's my idea of flagrantly disregarding the memo I sent you on your expenses . Where is that hideous noise coming from ? Des Moines . He picks up the rockabilly station from Streebsport at night . Looks like bridgework with a taste for hard rock . why don 't we get this guy to a dentist before his brain fries . Check . Hayes . Where are you going ? Lunch . Excuse me . maybe you could get Paul Harvey and the news ? Someone told me it 's all happening at the zoo I do believe it I do believe it 's true Mmm mmm hmm how do you think he 's doing ? you guys . I don 't think the sedative those guys gave him did much for his temperament . He doesn 't trust me . I can 't get through wouldn 't you feel a little edgy if you were locked up like this ? we 're just lucky the zoology department 's going along with us on this . We had nowhere else to put ' im . Where do you think he 's from ? judging from his appearance . Although he isn 't responding to any of the tribal languages . There 're people in the rainforest there that have never even seen modern man . I read that . National Geographic I think it was . wait . Whoa here . Time out . Are you trying to tell me that this little guy just sailed six thousand miles just to do a little surfing on Venice Beach ? It 's almost eight thousand . And it 's definitely not to go surfing . Whatever he 's here for has something to do with that totem in his hand . But we can 't find out until we can get him to communicate . Do you mind if we try ? I 'd like that . Just keep your distance . I don 't want you getting hurt . Okay . Billy ? Billy : Did you hear that ? El : Hear what ? Billy : The tone in her voice . She likes you . come on . She does not . I 'm tellin ' you : she likes you . it 's just your imagination . and if you don 't ask her out this weekend — look . We barely know each other . see you already have something in common . I don 't wanna talk about this now . okay ? dancing in threes is really uncool . how 're you gonna know unless you take a run by her anyway ? Huh ? how are we ever gonna know what he wants unless we ask him . Right ? you gotta take chances huh ? heyyy . huh ? Is this nice ? Beautiful . This is some nice stuff . Great . huh ? Deanna said not to get too close . El . You can 't establish rapport without a little proximity . Okay ? Link . We 're your friends . We 're just here to — to help you . right ? Huh ? don 't worry about it . Sledgehammer head ? Tell ya what ya do . Relax a little . Just try to breathe . Link ! all we wanna know is why you came here . Oogala oogala ! clears it up for me . it has to do something with his carving . I — I think that 's the — Billy ! Hang on ! You okay ? but ... we communicated ! What the hell 's he doing now ? humming . Humming ? Wait a minute . Music . Universal language . na ... na-na-na-na Do the pony Like Bony Maronie Do the twist Let 's do it like this na-na-na-na na-na-na-na Billy does a yo-yo Got to go-go na-na-na-na It 's working ! He 's tapping his toes . You gonna write that down ? yeah . Toe tapping . No problem . he 's coming down from the tree ! He 's got him Dancing . dancing . Link ! The guy 's a regular Fred Astaire ! Link . It 's okay . Looks like he finally found a friend . after I broke the ice . Right . Keeya . That 's Keeya . Keeya . Shunda ! What 's he saying ? What is it ? It 's the totem . Something about the sky . Keeya . Oomuma . Shunda ! do you want to send it somewhere ? Link ? no . He wants to leave it somewhere . He wants to leave it somewhere . but where ? Where ? 'Shunda ' . Shunda . That 's it . Shunda . Of course . He wants to send it to Shunda ! KOMACK : That 's fine . But where 's Shunda ? Deanna : That 's why we want to set him free . Komack : Do you have any idea of the risk you 'll be taking ? The man is a primitive . We wanna keep him that way . Exposing him to any outside influences could ruin — Our studies ? What we 're studying is why he came here . I don 't think I have to tell you the reputation you 're getting for your lack of scientific controls . have been on my back about the chances you 've been taking . Chance — The guy paddled seven thousand mi — Eight thousand . Eight thousand miles and you 're talking about taking chances here ? And what if he gets away ? We won 't take our eyes off him . I give you my word . It 's not your word I want . You got it . Shunda . Link . Tri-angle . It 's just like all the rest . Shunda ! This isn 't getting us anywhere . We have to be patient . Keep ' im communicating . So you think he 's gonna like these ? If he 's got a tolerance for hot grease they taste a lot better . come on . I 'd stay away from the pennies – they probably give you a lot of heartburn . come on . it 's good . Well that 's one way to handle the grease . uh you know . Yes it is . the guy knows who 's cool and who 's not . Okay . So where do we start ? At the beach where he landed . We 'll let ' im loose with Johnny B and see where he takes us . Right . And I guess the rest of us 'll spread out and form a safety net . Shunda . keep an eye out for this triangle . ya know ? Shunda ! Johnny : Oh no . Man : What the hell do you think you 're doin ' ? ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! Shunda ! buddy . You fenderhead ! you punk ! I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Floyd . don 't ! Get serious ! Billy : Glo ! babe . I just didn 't wanna hurt ' em . that 's all . Link . Link ? Link ? Link ? you guys hit the intersection . Okay ? Take off . I really should call Komack . I mean and I 'm responsible . babe . Okay ? how far can he get ? an actor ! please stop and see us . I could just die ! Hayes . No luck . Glo : But there 's a woman down there who thought she saw a little guy climb into a Hollywood bus . downtown . okay ? So I think we oughta split up right now . um ... They 're gonna put me in the movies They 're gonna make a big star outta me Make a film about a man that 's sad and lonely act naturally I bet you I 'm gonna be a big star you can never tell Movie 's gonna make me a big star 'Cause I can play the part so well I hope you 'll come and see me in the movies Then I 'll know that you will plainly see The biggest fool that ever hit the big time act naturally We 'll make a scene about a man that 's sad and lonely Beggin ' down upon his bended knee but I won 't need rehearsin' act naturally I bet you I 'm gonna be a big star you can never tell Movie 's gonna make me a big star 'Cause I can play the part so well I hope you 'll come and see me in the movies Then I 'll know that you will plainly see The biggest fool that ever hit the big time act naturally El ! Great idea . Why don 't you guys go down to the courthouse and meet Jane down there ? Great . We 'll jump in the truck and start cruising ' . it 's gotta work . how hard can it be to find one ... very strange guy ? I 'm really scared for him . He 's out there somewhere all alone . Do you know what could happen to him ? you know what could happen to us ? I 'm gonna take away their parking spaces . And their electricity . And their floor . An — Could you ? Coffee break . Oh . they 're not here . I-I 've heard so much about you . I haven 't seen them . two hours ... I was hoping that Hayes and Lincoln would — ' Crackpots ' ? at Humanidyne here — I 'm Dick Stetmeyer . And why is that funny ? there 's no need to call the police . I 'm sure they 're being very discreet . this is Unit Four . naked . Cop : Except for a loincloth . And keep this one kind of casual . how far could he go ? keeping this whole thing a big secret . anything . You know that . Do you think maybe we could lose the sound effect ? No problem . Sergeant ? This is Dr. Komack . I want — I want to report a missing person . naked except for a loincloth . And he 's with — You did ? They what ? ! I 'll swing around and meet you . Okay ? I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses for you baby . - Like I really need this now . make you feel real good . Not interested . then ? it 'll do things to you ain 't never been done before . you set me up with some of what you got . man . Whoa . Whoa . Another movie star ! Look at this . like this . man . I 'm Robert DeNiro . Shunda . Shunda ! Store Clerk : Hey get outta there ! Get outta the window ! What 're you doing there ? ! Somebody get him outta there ! you 're good at helping the crazies . Hey ! Police ! Police ! Over here ! This way ! I may have your missing person in sight . I 'm pursuing on foot near Hollywood and Wilcox . He took my Shuttle ! He took my Shuttle ! we may have your missing person in sight . proceeding to Hollywood and Vine . man . mister ! Glo : There 's Link ! on the fire escape . Link ! Link . his friend . Glo : Won 't somebody help ' im ? He 's gonna fall ! no ! how 'd he do that ? let 's get him in the truck . We 'll get him in the truck . Come On Link : Shunda . No ! Okay . We 're taking over now . Komack — - He 's outta your hands . And you tell Deanna she 's off this project . son . easy . What 're you doing ? Atta boy . Atta boy . Komack ? don 't hurt ' im . Open the door . take it easy on ' im . son . That 's it . That 's it . let go of ' im . You 're gonna hear from me later . All of you . Shunda ! Link . Shunda ! we can 't — Put his life in danger again ? Is that what you want ? What we want is to give ' im a chance to show us why he 's here . Maybe he just wants to go window shopping . Have you seen these bills ? - Not to mention the involvement with the police and the press . Twenty-six hundred dollars in one catalog store . One catalog ... - You 've managed to turn a perfectly good scientific investigation ... Dick : ... There 's a solar-powered pet watering dish into a media circus . ... That 's a hundred and sixty-nine dollars . A crystal chronometer ... Excuse me ! uh ... Excuse me . Could you spare us your fiscal reports ? I just thought — don 't think ! this is what I want . I want the primitive to remain in his habitat . scientific way . that 's the way it 's going to be ! Remember the one we did last night ? singing ' do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do . that was your favorite . She looked good — ah . ah . but Komack 's right . I blew it . a good scientist has got to be prepared to go out on a limb . He 's got to have the courage to make mistakes . I just wish I could be more like you . Like me ? Absolutely . You do your homework . Your research is meticulous . and you don 't take chances . Thanks . Hi guys . Hi . How ya doin ' ? I thought at least we could bring the outside world to him . look at this . Hold it . Jane . Her name is Jane . Tarzan . The original . what 's he doing ? it 's okay . He 's really gentle . He seems to like everybody . everybody except Hayes . or something . Maybe he just likes it . Keeya . Maybe he means that doll he 's got Keeya . 'Keeya ' . What 's ' Keeya ' ? Link . ' Keeya ' ? Keeya . but what ? Keeya ! ( Speaking in foreign language ) Keewya ? Keewya ! Keewya ! Keewya ! Keewya ! ( Hysterical Screaming ) Keewya ! Keewya drowned . His kid drowned . Keeya . Glo : Then he drew this triangle . It was so sad . But it would make sense . The child drowned and they never recovered the body . here it is . It says here : they sometimes carve figures representing the souls of dead relatives . that would explain why his doll is so precious to ' im . If it 's his child 's soul ... that 's what he did next He put the doll on top of the triangle and he went just like this . Trying to lift the doll and the triangle into the sky . Or maybe into heaven . Does he know about heaven ? but he knows about gods Wait . If the boy drowned — Then they weren 't able to cremate the remains . So instead of the smoke lifting Keeya 's soul into heaven ... He needs us to help him do it . But with what ? or something ? or something . Magic bird " . The catalogs ! Wait a minute . Jane : What are you looking for ? Show him that . Link . Link . Shuuunda ! Shunda ! Shunda . Shunda . You got it . Works for me . Komack : Absolutely not . Forget it . This — this guy paddled halfway across the world for the sake of his child 's soul . And you 're saying you 're gonna stop him from fulfilling — I 'm saying he 's staying right here in the safety of the habitat . Ant that 's that . isn 't there something you can do for us here ? i-if it were up to me — E — eight thousand miles is a long way — - Can you butt out ? Now just a minute — and that 's the end of it . El : Wrong . long way . he can count on me . On us . I 'm calling the police . I don 't think so . but they 're right . I think even I would resent being locked up in some monkey home Now don 't for one minute think this is company policy . I 'm on my own time here . Stet . Just don 't — Get outta here . Have a nice day . this time for sure . Uh ... That 's it ? there 's something I wanna ask you . We did it . About this weekend . We did it ! Are you busy Saturday night ? are you sure this is gonna work ? they 'll let Link put Keeya on the Shuttle and we 'll go home . It 's a piece of cake . Major . Richard Stetmeyer from Humanidyne We did — we did some work for you last year . Dick : We worked on that tracking system and set it up . but — and maybe you aren 't . You could be the press for all I know . it was all over the front pages . The Russians had a field day . I 'd like to handle this on a friendly basis . But I want you to know at the outset : I 'm not without friends in Washington Washington D.C. they 're very dangerous . They could be a threat to our security . they 're not dangerous . Except to me . you just better pray they don 't crack the perimeter of this base . My orders are to shoot to kill . Shoot to ki — Seriously ? You better believe it . they 're dead . okay ? just like you and me . but we 're talking the Space Shuttle . billy : So what ? You think their orders are to shoot to kill ? Columbia . Cleared to proceed to runway two seven . we 're still checking that phone call . but I 'm not taking that chance . in exactly forty-seven minutes . Deanna : It 's my fault . it 's not your fault . It-it 's me . this has never happened to me before . Not with anyone . it 's alright . It 's probably just the pressure . On the back of my neck . Right . Deanna do you still respect me ? it takes a big man to admit he 's little . rollin ' or what ? No way . That 's not a reasonable man over there . huh ? Hayes ? I don 't know yet . uh ... Something simple . Something safe . Something ... Absolutely foolproof . This 'll work . This 'll work . and I killed them . Stetmeyer . They 're gonna be fine . that 's all . sensible way to do things . I don 't think that 'll even occur to them . by now they 've had time to think of – God help us – a plan . I hope this plan of yours — it 'll work . Okay ? It 's simple . I 'm just addressing this envelope to Major Logger . Then I 'm just gonna drop it off with the Terminator over there . And he 's gonna get in and he 's gonna talk to Logger face-to-face . you know what I mean ? It 'll work okay ? Maybe later . Ready ? Yeah . here we go . it 'll — it 'll work . huh ? I think so . who 's gonna argue with a seven-foot-four naked black guy ? Good point . Officer : Please advise . An all-points bulletin has been issued for a white ice cream truck in the vicinity of ... Manos . Manos . We interrupt the music with a special news bulletin . The police have just issued an all-points bulletin for the Misfits of Science — — who are believed to be on their way to Edwards Air Force Base to stop the Shuttle transportation ... come here . Listen . has not been determined ... Shunda . ... But the Misfits of Science have had their way with the military in the past ... We 're gonna have to warn Billy . But what if he 's already messengered El ? ... everything in their power to stop them . get in the back . Hayes ! Maybe I didn 't go over this part of the plan too well . You guys are supposed to — get in ! on the street on every beat deep inside just to stay alive 'Cause the heat is on oh-wo-ho I 've been looking out for you oh-wo-ho can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it the heat is on It 's on the street The heat is ... on I 've been looking out for you oh-wo-ho can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it The shadow 's High On the Darker side Behind the door Is a wilder ride \ N The heat is on It 's on the street The heat is ... on oh-wo-ho I 've been looking out for you oh-wo-ho can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it ( The streets are on fire ) ( flames are burning higher ) the heat is on it 's on the street ... sir . Billy : Take a right . would they ? Glo . Get in the back . huh ? Who 's got insurance ? guys Do you think they 'd split us up if we go to jail ? or not ? look . We 're gonna make it to the Shuttle . And Link 's gonna put his little statue thing onboard . Link ? Billy : Link ? ! Uh oh . Sargent : Major Logger ? We have an intruder running for the Shuttle . there he is . because I 'm sure by now El 's gotten to Logger and explained . You know ? then ... Johnny : A couple of ' em are looking heavy . we 're gonna have to do something here . B-Man . Now ! Hayes . I got it . but ... You have orders to shoot to kill ! wait ! What the — Don 't shoot ! They 're the Misfits of Science ! I gotta try a run before I 'm outta juice . no ! crazy ? We 're almost caught up . Just cut him off ! you 're too close to them ! would they ? Hold your fire ! Hold fire ! Looks like it 's time for a little show of diplomacy here . I — didn 't you explain ? I explained . Misfits of Science . I don 't care who you are . You 're lucky all I 'm doing is arresting you . we 're lucky ? gang ? huh ? too ? Logger ? and this guy 's got another cage for ya . smart guy . Hayes . I 've had it ! I 've had it up to here with these guys . Logger ? You gonna shoot us ? Is that what you 're gonna do ? do it . Get it over with ! please . do you have any idea who this guy is ? Do you have a clue what this man 's done ? just to put that little doll of his on your Shuttle . he brought the soul of his dead little boy halfway across the world that 's exactly what he 's gonna do . Billy : If you want us to start tossing ' lightning bolts ... And tossing ' the guns out of your hands ... Then we can do that . That 's fine . And we may even beat ya . We 're gonna help Link put that carving on that Shuttle . With you or without you Link . Denise : Has anyone seen El ? you okay ? I 'm sorry . I sat down and my knees had an out-of-body experience you 're the essence of cool now . no . Billy . I 'm serious . Okay ? I think this — this night has changed our lives . Okay ? No more science . You and I are goin ' all the way with The Dancing Misfits . Huh ? Come on ! wait . We can do all the big shows . we got " Letterman " . We can do " Carson " . Billy . the " Donahue " thing . Billy ! babe ? Stop talking . right . TV : And now back to the studio ... turn it up . TV : ... fill you in with the latest update on the Space Shuttle . Shuttle Discovery launched its top secret military payload into outer space today . Which ANC News learned to be three Star Wars test satellites . primitive carving of a man . but the Soviets immediately criticized the U.S. for using outer space voodoo to gain an edge in the Star Wars — I hope Link can find his way home . I think he already has . Hey Hey Misfits Zap Me with Your Misfit Science Shoot me full of ecstasy Ice Cool Electric and alive You Fool Love you for your mind I Can Feel it Feels Like Science Straight From The Heart Class Assignment oh no no Science is over Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies .

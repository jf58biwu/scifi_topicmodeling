I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . The whole town 's changed but faces all looks the same . Yeah , not much of a life , is it ? What we 're doing ? It 'll do . We 'd better get you registered . What do you mean " we " , pale face ? It 's OK , I can handle it . Are you sure ? Yeah ! It 's routine _ _ _ _ _ ! Gee , I don 't know where my transcripts went . We 've been moving around so much , I had a tutor last semester , I guess she took them with her when she went to Argentina . Old cert record ? Must be with the transcript , well , unless they were lost in the fire . You 'd better go . Good luck in your job interview . Good luck in school , I 'll see you tonight . I don 't care if he 's got a brownie Instamatic and he can 't find the little button , a newspaper without pictures is going to look pretty funny ! Off ! Why don 't you call one of your yuppie buddies on the New York Times ? Maybe they 'll send a photographer out to cover the City Council meeting for you . I got a better idea ! Why don 't you write another 10 inches to cover the blank space ? What ? Do you think that the public is really interested in what the Council have for lunch ? Excuse me ? They said to talk to you about a job as a photographer ? Yeah ! Right ! What 's your name ? Paul Forrester ! Connell , you 're a jerk . Get out of here ! Both of you ! Hey ! I don 't know this guy ! Are you the same Paul Forrester that took this ? Yes ! Paul Forrester happens to be one of the best photo journalists alive . What would you be doing hanging around San León ? What would anybody be doing in San León ? Are you really Paul Forrester ? Pictures don 't lie . Ahm , if the cops are after you , I don 't wanna know . OK ? Now , let 's talk about money . That 's a good idea . Ahm , it 's not going to be what you 're used to , I 'm afraid . We run a pretty tight ship . I 'll vouch for that ! Forrester ? Meet Joe Connell . He 'll probably ask you to pay for your own film , Enough , Connell ! 500 a week is as high as I can go . OK , who buys the film ? Don 't pay any attention to Connell . Now , how soon can you start ? How about tomorrow ? How about today ? There 's a City Council meeting in 30 minutes . Look , Here 's a 100 dollars cash advance , go buy yourself some film . Connell ? Forrester is going with you on this . Come on ! Get the led out ! The led is out ! Touch them ! Double ! Let those hams cry ! What 's the matter , Hardy ? Are you saving your energy for lunch ? Come on ! Touch them ! Grab them ! Let those hams cry ! There you go ! Touch them ! Grab them ! Let those hams cry ! Good ! Real good ! Alright ! Take a look at how it 's done ! OK ! Everybody up ! Alright ! Two laps , to the shower , let 's go ! That 's pretty impressive ! Did you ever compete ? No . Why 'd you stop running ? Did you know you gave our number one man on a cross-county team all he could want ? Why don 't you come out with the track team , start practice tomorrow ? I don 't think so . Get you out of gym class . Actually , I don 't want to get involved with any stuff like that . Here you are , Forrester . Right in there ... . Well , what about you ? I could not stand one more feast of words . Who 's gonna write the story ? In the unlikely event that anything happens in there worth writing about , I 'll borrow somebody else 's notes , in the meantime , I 'll be right across the street , in a little tavern called Julie Anne 's . You pick me up when you 're through . A picture 's worth 1000 words , right ? Click ! Click ! ( Ladies and Gentlemen , the meeting is called to order ... ) Hi ! Hi ! I saw you in " P " class this morning . You could 've beaten Eric Baker if you wanted to . Maybe , he 's pretty fast . He 's not as hard as he thinks he is . Did you join the team ? I 'm not much for teams . My name 's Kelly Jordan . Scott Hayden . Well , I gotta go to Math class . Oh ! See you around . Yeah , sure ! How 's your day been so far ? I 'm still here ! I think you 're about to wish you weren 't . Your genius forgot to read the instructions that came with this camera . He didn 't focus it ! Forrester ? What 's this supposed to be ? I think they said his name was Buckwalter , I can 't see much here but I can see that that 's not Buckwalter ! Here ! My God ! He 's asleep ! That 's Buckwalter ! No ! No , you mean that was Buckwalter ! I can 't wait to see him dance his way out of this one ! Great shot , Paul ! Great shot ! Listen , what 's your credit ? Just " Photo by Paul Forrester " ? Ah , no , I don 't want any credit . OK , never mind . Remember I said I didn 't wanna know . Let 's suggest this for page one , and run the credit ! How often do we get Paul Forrester , anyway ? Yes , Sir ! That is if Connell ever finishes his story ! I 'm working on it ! This must bring back a lot of memories for you . Yes ! Chairs , Tables ... This ... Who could forget ? I 'm Mrs Madison , I 'm Scott 's Homeroom Advisor . I 've been meeting with the parents to get some idea of the student 's home life . What do you wanna know about Scott 's home life ? Well , I sense that something 's bothering Scott , his work is alright but he 's , I don 't know , he 's uninvolved . What I mean is like he 's here and yet he isn 't here . Is he that way at home ? No ! When he 's home , he 's there ! Hmm , well that certainly isn 't the case , here . It 's as if he 's afraid to participate . Do you have any idea why ? I suppose it 's because we 're traveling all the time . New schools , teachers , and friends . You know , my being a photographer and all . Yes , and from what I hear , quite a brilliant photographer too ! What was your Alma Mater ? Alma Mater ? I graduated from Radcliffe , 72 Radcliffe ? Ha , ha , ha , yes ! Me too ! Ah , " Cliffy " ? I don 't believe it ! Of course when I went there , it was a Girls ' College . That was before they fought the sexual revolution . I guess the whole thing was over with by the time I got there . Who won ? So what else did she say ? That 's all . You spent the whole time talking about the sexual revolution ? You 're supposed to be talking about me , though . We did talk about you ! She likes you . She thinks you 're smart . I didn 't think she even noticed me ! She also said there was a Homecoming Dance soon . She asked me if I 'd be a chaperone . What 's a chaperone ? I was hoping you 'd know . Well , you don 't have to worry about me , I 'm not going . Why not ? You know why not , we have to keep a low profile . Maybe this would be good for you to do . Hey , you 're the one that 's always telling me how careful we have to be and I think you 're right . I mean , I just don 't wanna get involved . Period . Hello ? Hi ! The what ? Yeah ! Sure ! When ? OK , see you ! Who was that ? It was Kelly Jordan . A kid from school needs some history notes . You never mentioned him . Her ! It 's a girl . What about you ? You haven 't told me anything ! What do you want to know ? I don 't know . Where do you come from ? Different places , my Dad travels a lot . What does he do ? He 's a photographer . And you and your mother like go with him everywhere ? Not exactly , erm ... See , I don 't have a mother . I do , but she 's not with us right now . Are they divorced ? Separated . A friend of mine 's parents did that too , got separated , they ended up getting a divorce . I don 't think my parents will get a divorce . I hope not . I think I 'd freak if my parents ever did that . They 're a little weird but at least they 're predictable . What 's your Dad like ? Well , he 's pretty weird , but he 's OK . Do you like traveling around ? Yeah ! It 's great . I mean , I ... Seattle one day , Phoenix the next We just kind of bump around all the major hotspots . It 's great . Do you wanna get going ? Yeah , OK ! So what about friends ? Friends ? Yeah , if you don 't know how long you 're gonna be in one place , how can you make friends ? I do OK . Well , it 's getting kind of late . You know ? My Dad is picking me up in front of the library , in ten minutes . Why the library ? He thinks I 'm studying . He wouldn 't let me hang around here on school night , would they ? I had a good time , Scott . Me too ! You wanna go out sometime ? With you ? Yeah , with me . Ah , I don 't know . It was just an idea . I forgot the history notes . How about Friday night ? It 's a date . Welcome to the team . A couple of things : You are on my team , you live by my rules . OK ? That means you work hard , you stay clean . We got a tough season coming up this year and I expect you to stick to it and committed , like everybody else . Alright ? You told me all that , coach . Yeah , I know I did , But I 've learnt over the years that it doesn 't hurt to say some things more than once . OK ? Now get on that bench . just stretch your skinny frame . Yes , Sir ! Are you ready ? Mr Wright said to get going . Mr Wright ? Ha ! You 're cute ! What the hell did I do with that pen ? We 're supposed to go to the City dump . Yeah . I 've already heard about his plum . It 's just one big story after another around here . Son of a gun ! I thought I paid that ! What 's this ? Ah ? Chicago Pressman 's Award , 1964 . I used to wear it when I was a reporter . What are you now ? Come on , let 's hit the dump first . Coach says you 're gonna run with varsity against Pendleton . Yeah , he told me . You run good . So do you . Got two things to say to you . Yeah ? Yeah ! I 'm gonna whip your butt . I 'm glad we 're on the same team , As a matter of fact , I happen to know know what computer time costs , Now all I 'm asking f ... Well it 's still a priority with me ! How the hell ... What ? I know , I 'm sorry , I shouldn 't raise my voice , please just print it out the first chance you get , this is really , very important . Yes . Yes , yes , I will , thank you . Yes , I 'll be waiting for your call . Alright , bye . Thank you George , one for my colleague , please put it on my tab . Same way ? I 'll have a glass of water . On the rocks . And you call yourself a news photographer ? How do you expect anyone to take you seriously if you don 't drink ? A picture 's worth 1000 words , right ? Yes . Don 't take any pictures of me . Besides , After what we saw at that landfill today , I think you should follow my example and stay far away from water . Does that go for ice too ? George ? George ? Let me have another , hold the ice . So , erm ... Did you enjoy your day waiting for garbage and toxic waste ? That 's my job ! That 's what they pay me for . Your job ? Do you really think they care about you ? They 're trying to sell this rag and as soon as they do , Believe me , you 'll be out in the street with the rest of us . I don 't like to stay in one place too long anyway . There 's too much to see ! You are a real Cub Scout , aren 't you ? Talent , integrity , I bet you help little old ladies across the street . But what are you doing here ? Taking pictures . No , you can do that in New York or LA , You don 't work in San León unless you can 't work anywhere else . You messed up somewhere , didn 't you ? Is that why you 're here ? It 's getting late . If you don 't like what you 're doing why don 't you do something else ? Cos I don 't know anything else . I don 't change what I do , I just change why I do it . I thought you weren 't gonna come . I was just sort of watching from over there . Why ? I wanted to make sure you 'd be here . Well , I got the tickets . So did I ! I 'd like my money back , please . Thank you ! What 's wrong ? I got an itch on my back . Where ? In here ? Thanks ! Well , Cub Scout , shall we scour the city for a scoop ? I gotta get home to my son . How touching ! Cute ! I think maybe you shouldn 't be driving ? The only time I 'm too drunk to drive is when I 'm passed out . And that won 't be for another 20 minutes . See you later . See you ! What the ... ? The transmission ! The transmission is shot ! I should have left this thing at the dump ! Do you mind if I give it a try ? Be my guest ! Cub Scout ! Check this out . Just came in with a wire from the coast . It 's out of focus ! Yeah ? Look again . Ha , ha , ha ! That 's a terrific shot . Look who took it . I wonder why Paul Forrester 's working out there . What 's the difference ? He 's either hiding from a bookie or a cookie . We can run this in the " Pictures worth 1000 bucks " department . Perfect . The bus should be coming any minute . I had a good time . Me too . Homecoming Dance is next week . Yeah , I 'm not going . Of course you are ! I am ? How else am I supposed to get to go ? You want me to take you to the Homecoming Dance ? Thank you ! I 'd love to . Oh ! Young love ! How would you like to start your life all over right there ? Hi ! You 're kind of late , aren 't you ? Oh , I was just practicing my reading . Upside down ? Well , if you practice , erm long enough , you can read it away . How was the movie ? Terrific ! You really like her , don 't you ? She 's OK . I saw you kissing at the bus stop . You were spying on me ? No ! No ! I was driving by and I happened to see you . Scott , it 's a father 's job to talk to his son about things like these . We learn all about that in biology . No , I 'm not talking about biology . I 'm talking about feelings . When I left , your mother would hurt . - This is different . - Are you sure ? Look I gotta get up tomorrow morning early . Scott ! Will you have the same pain when we have to leave ? No ! Don 't worry about it , OK ? I got it under control . So how was the snack , girls ? Oh , you mean you didn 't stop for milk and cookies , so my my stopwatch is on the freeze . But I got a solution . I 'm gonna give you a one minute head start . I 'm fresh as a daisy and I 'm gonna be running hard , and if I beat any of you , back to the starting line at the school yard Don 't let it happen . You 'd better get going ! You got 57 more seconds . No , no , no , come on , this way ! Hey what 's going on ? - Follow us , Scott ! - Through here ! We beat him every time . Wow ! Hey ! Hahahaha ! What stopped you , man ? OK , guys , here it is . Some time between 5 and 6 AM this morning , Matthew Wheeler , aged 63 , a blind news vendor was beaten and robbed . He leaves no known survivors and an autopsy is pending to determine the exact cause of death . We have no leads at this time . You 'll be apprised of the details of the investigation as they develop . Thank you . Get some coverage of that newsstand around the corner and also some of the cops too . Forrester ! Satellite photos ? Sir ? You 're supposed to be checking the latest satellite photos . They 're finished . And ? Nothing . Now I 'm checking something else . A newspaper ? I get a lot of ideas from this newspaper . For instance , Last week they had a story about a farmer in Indiana , who heard a funny noise outside , and when he looks outside , he sees a pulsing light , sort of hovering above his hen house , and guess what ? No ! I want you to run down to the data section to see if my print-outs are ready . And Wiley ? Get me some coffee on your way back . Hey ! Alright , Paul ! That picture you took at the City Council meeting got picked out by the AP , congratulations . Way to go ! AP , what do you know ? They 'll probably run it all over the country . Great . Care about the glory ? Cub Scout ? Just wanna take good pictures ? I don 't get it . You say you 've been around but it 's like you 're seeing everything for the first time . That 's what I do . Sorry , it just doesn 't add up . From Time and Newsweek covers to here , that 's a long slide . You just don 't look like you 've been through it . You still care . And you don 't ? Believe me ! There 's nothing new for me under the Sun , I 've seen it all , too many times . Maybe you haven 't . Hey , rag tux , dude ! Alright ! You must be Scott 's father . We 're Kelly 's parents . - Scott 's date ? - Oh ! Rag tux , dude ! Narrowly ... Totally . Nice to meet you ! Oh , oh ! Is that you father ? Ah ! Yeah , that 's him ! He 's cute ! Hot tux , too . Let 's go say hi . No , later , OK ? - Hi ! - Oh , hi ! I just met Kelly 's parents . Narrowly and totally ! Do you wanna dance ? No ! Oh , right ! You unreconstructed type think the man should do the asking , huh ? No ! It 's not that ! It 's just that I don 't know how . To this stuff ? Who does ? Come on ! Wow ! Ho ! I 'm so glad you came this evening . I 've been wanting to talk to you . about the remarkable change in Scott . Of course , I 've seen it before . You know , once a youngster becomes accepted . they 're like flowers blooming . You 're son is at home here now . He belongs . We have to talk . OK , I 'm sorry I 'm so late , it 's just the best party I 've ever been to in my life . It 's not about that . A picture that I took got picked up by a national wire service . So ? It had my name on it . Fox might see it . Wait . I know how you feel . No , you don 't . Maybe Fox won 't see it . What if he does ? Well , then let him ! For the first time in my life , I have friends , I have a place I care about . You can run if you want to , but I 'm staying . You can 't stay , Scott , you know that . This is all your fault , If I had a normal father , like every other kid . You are what you are . There 's nothing you can do about it . You should have thought about that before you came back . I came back because of the feelings that I had for your mother . Now I have those feelings for you , it 's the bond , that keeps us together . Now you 're forming new attachments ... That 's the point ! The point is , You 're thinking with your heart , not your brain . There 's a real danger out there , you 're not seeing it . I just don 't wanna spend the rest of my life running . If we don 't run , you won 't have a life . Heading for the office ? Hop in ! Thanks but I 'd rather walk . How did you know where I live ? I used to be a reporter , remember ? Listen , I 've been thinking about what you said , and maybe I haven 't seen it all . Sometimes the most amazing things are right in front of us . and you don 't even notice ... We can be a hell of a team , you and me . I mean , we could make Woodward and Bernstein look like Micky Mouse and Donald Duck ! Who ? Yeah ! Cute ! Cute ! Look , just think about it , OK ? Enjoy your walk . You nervous ? I 've never done this before . I just know you 're gonna win . And I know you 're gonna break the tape first and when you do I 'll come down running from the stand , just like in Rocky . Well , suppose I come in ninth . Then I 'll still come running down . How are you feeling ? Great ! Hey , let 's try to stay close to each other at the beginning , then we can kill off their pace , and set each other up for the finishing kick . - Whatever takes the team to win . - You got it ! ( OK , off the track , everyone ! ) ( We 're at the start of the cross-country ) ( Come on , everybody get off ! We gotta get going ! ) I thought you had to go to work . I got off early . I 've been thinking , maybe he won 't see the picture . I 'm glad you 're here . ( Cross-country runners to the starting line ! ) ( The race is about to begin ! ) Break a leg . I 'll ask for something different but thanks . ( Come on , guys ! ) Good luck ! Don 't choke on my dust . ( Take your mark ! ) ( Set ! ) ( The runners are leaving the track ) Where are you going ? Hey ! You can 't quit ! Come on ! We gotta get out of here ! What 's wrong ? Fox is on town ! ( The runners have one left round the track to go ) What happened to this guy Hayden ? Hey ! Forrester ! Forrester ! Paul ! What 's going on ? Come on , Cub Scout ! You can 't run out on me ! Not now ! We can help each other ! I 'm not your Cub Scout . I can 't help you across the street , but you can do it yourself . My God ! Who are you ? Answer the question ! I 'm something new under the Sun . ( And Eric Baker from Union is the winner of the race ! ) What happened ? I don 't know ! I guess he shone on . First time I run with him , and he quit ! He didn 't quit ! I don 't what happened , why or anything , but I know Scott Hayden didn 't quit ! I don 't want you or anybody else to say that again ! Come on , Scott , let 's go . I 'm coming . I 'm sorry . It 's OK . Come on , let 's go . Hmm . I 'm sorry . Oh , forget it . I can 't ! Everything we had to leave behind ... school . A girlfriend . Friends . A girlfriend . A nice place you loved . A girlfriend . A girlfriend . I 'm sorry because it means so much to you . I 'd like you to have these things growing up , and to be able to give them to you but I can 't . - When we find Jenny ... - Things will be great ! That 's why we 'll keep looking , right ? Right ! We still got each other , right ? Right . It 's too bad , though . What ? That you couldn 't finish the race . You were running pretty fast . Who knows ? You might have won . Are you kidding ? Those guys were crawling ! They were backing up ! No contest ! No , you weren 't running that fast ! I suppose you could do better . Ha , ha , ha ... Are you telling me that you 're a runner ? Are you kidding ? You see that tree down there ? Race you , go ! Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * *

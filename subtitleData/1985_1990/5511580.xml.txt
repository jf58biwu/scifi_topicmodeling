 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food ! The Resistance is all that stands between us and the Visitors . - Which way ? - According to Robert , it is just ahead . Well , we made it this far . This time I have them . The Mentamorph is a perfect lure . The Leader will decorate me personally for this . A few hundred more yards and I 'll have them within range . Come , my little mice , closer to the bait . What is this ? It 's a surprise ending to the Resistance . How come I wasn 't informed of this operation ? I knew nothing about this . It 's amazing how much you know nothing about . - You insubordinate swine , I 'll ... - You 'll do nothing . As usual . And may I suggest , Diana , you pray ... that this little operation of yours is successful . Don 't worry . It will be . Watch . Entertaining , isn 't it ? You seem to enjoy the killing . Don 't you ? I heard that you were once a warrior . I still am ... but the only death I 'll enjoy is that Donovan 's . The man who killed my brother . That is the Mentamorph . - That is weird . - Yes . It is more than that . It is evil . It is a one of a kind monster . It 's some kind of mind-control device , right ? It destroys the will to live , and to fight . Come on , let 's blow it to hell . You know something ... I don 't like this a bit . It 's been too easy getting here . Come on , don 't look a gift horse in the mouth . Wait , it 's started pulsing . Is it supposed to do that ? Get down ! It 's not real . - What ? - It 's a fake . The real Mentamorph would never shatter . Diana must have set us up . Come on , let 's get out of here . Did something go wrong , dear ? Something or someone tripped the explosives prematurely . You 've failed . Lock the lasers within a five-mile radius . I want you to vaporize the entire area . - Lasers locked on target . - Fire . - I said , " Fire " ! - I am . You incompetent fool ! I have been betrayed . - Pity . - Enough . It was you . - Are you accusing me of treason ? - Silence ! Just one word , Diana , and I 'll run you so far from the fleet ... the only thing you 'll command is a garbage scow . I think Philip 's found your true calling . And I hold you equally responsible . You are her commanding officer . Check the electromagnetics . Deck B , chamber 24 . Looks like sabotage . - Whoever it was will plead for death . - Please forget the histrionics . Come with me . Come on , we must hurry . I 'm afraid I do not move as fast as I used to , Robert . Maybe I should not have gotten involved with the Fifth Column . - I 'm sorry . - For what ? For making me proud of you ? For trying to stop the killing ? You did what you had to . I love you , Glenda . We love you , too . I think we shook them when we doubled back . I 'm sorry , I led you into a trap . Come on , you weren 't alone out there . If only Elizabeth were here , she would have sensed something . But she 's not . She 's with Julie up north at the research center . I should have known that Mentamorph was not real . Willie , you made a mistake . Nobody 's perfect . No , I should leave before I get you both killed . Come on . Where are you gonna go ? I don 't know . I 'll find a cave somewhere . You belong here . You 're one of us . No , Mike , I 'm not . I 'm different . I 'm alone ... I 'm a cast out ... and I bleed green . Robert , a traitor ? You can 't trust anyone anymore . The guards trailed him and his wife to the landing bay . Without those beryllium crystals we can 't fire a laser . Yes , and now we 're vulnerable , thanks to you . Return to the bridge . Call in all starfighters to a defensive perimeter . What about our offensives ? Forget them . We need to protect the Mother Ship . - There they are . Kill them . - No . You 'll destroy the crystals . You 've had ample opportunity to defeat the Resistance . Now it 's my turn . Are these fighters still equipped with homing devices ? Yes . Traitors will run right to the Resistance . I 'll be right behind them . - You 'll need an escort . May I suggest ... - I don 't care who it is ... as long as they don 't get in my way . You haven 't changed , have you , Angela ? You still take pleasure in inflicting pain . You haven 't changed , either . Still caring about the weak and the beaten . Do you two know each other ? Philip was my combat master at the academy before I was shipped out . So much the better . She is not an acceptable escort . I 'm surprised that you would allow your personal feelings ... to interfere with sound military judgment . Clearly she is the best for the job . Prepare yourself for combat . We leave in one hour . - And you do nothing unless I order it . - As always , sir . Sir ! He 's in a bad mood . Did you have some difficulty with Philip at the academy ? I killed a cadet while in training . Philip had me retired ... destroyed any chance I would have had to become an officer . I can understand why you 're angry with him . - You must dislike him a great deal . - I hate him ... the sanctimonious coward . Why don 't you come to my quarters and we 'll discuss it ? - Man , Willie 's really upset . - I can 't say I blame him . He 's a trillion light years away from home ... and his own people are trying to kill him . How would you feel ? Yeah , I guess you 're right . - It must be lonely . - I guess so . Over there . It 's going down . Come on . You live well . Is it this way for all officers ? Rank does have its privileges . Care for a snack ? Thanks , I would . First time I saw you ... I knew that you were officer material . I would be , if it weren 't for Philip . Philip 's vendetta against you is unpardonable . I could give you a battlefield commission right away . But Philip would just cancel it . I 'm afraid it 's true . As long as he 's alive . What if ... Yes ? You can tell me , dear . We 're friends . What if Philip were dead ? Then the commission would instantly be yours . It will be difficult . Philip 's a combat master . It will be easier than you think . When Philip meets Donovan , they will fight . - Philip will crush Donovan . - Perhaps . But then you 'll kill Philip . They 'll both be dead and you 'll be an officer . Would you care for another ? - Are you all right ? - I am fine . I think the moment may be soon . Freeze ! Put them up , get your hands up . Are you with the Resistance ? My name is Robert . I am with the Fifth Column . I told Willie about the Mentamorph . You 're the guy that set us up . I did not know it was a trap . I triggered the explosion as soon as I found out . Please , you have to help my wife . - Yeah , she 's ... - Pregnant . The photo drive unit 's still warm . We should be right behind them . And their escort . It appears there were two of them . It will be difficult to follow on asphalt . Not with this . I thought you had given up combat for the law . I have . What 's the matter ? Miss the taste of blood ? I see you 're still that same blood-thirsty orphan I found on Andromeda 's moon . You should have killed me when your armies killed the rest of my people . It 's too late now . You 're soft ... like your brother Martin before he was killed . - What do you know of my brother ? - There were rumors . - What kind of rumors ? - That he was with the Fifth Column . Those are lies . My brother was a loyalist . He was loyal to the Leader . - Lf you say so . - I do ! I 'm going to kill the man who murdered him . Only him ? What about the rest of the Resistance ? I 'll leave them to you . Have you ever done this before ? I helped with my own kid , but Glenda 's not ... - Not human . - Yeah . How much different could it be ? Come on , sit down here . Shouldn 't somebody be boiling some water or something ? No water . Like I said , no water . Yes ? - Glenda and I were wondering ... - What ? Our child will need a Wantu . Especially since he will be a stranger on this planet . Yes , you 're right . I suggest you choose Mike Donovan . He is a hero . Wait a minute , I 'll get it . What 's a Wantu ? Mr. Kyle , a Wantu is like ... a second father , a friend , a teacher ... - rolled into one . - A role model . Actually , I was thinking of you , Willie . Me ? You want me ? I think you 'd make a great Wantu . I 'm going to have a baby . And a family . Is this it ? All right , this is it . Let 's get busy . It is coming . I 'm very busy , Diana . What was it you wanted ? - I 've been thinking ... - Incredible . A new experience for you . - You are charming . - Don 't waste my time . Philip has me running circuit checks ... on every electrical and magnetic board on the ship . What ? A line officer doing manual labor ? It 's disgusting . I only hope he and Donovan kill each other . Brilliant . - What ? - The plan you just thought of . Plan ? Yes , it is brilliant . When Donovan and Philip fight , I 'll make sure there are no survivors . The Leader will believe Philip was killed by the Resistance . Do it . That 's an order . You amaze me , Lydia . That 's because I 'm your commanding officer . It is brilliant . When Donovan and Philip fight , I 'll make sure there are no survivors . The Leader will believe Philip was killed by the Resistance . That 's it . Now keep pushing . You 're doing fine . Her toes are curling . That means it is time . Concentrate . You can do it . Push . That 's fine . I think I can see its head . I think . Just one more , then you can rest . It 's an egg . Man , this I got to see . We must work quickly . Mike , help me remove some shell quickly . He is beautiful . Robert , you have a son . I wish we had some champagne to celebrate ... but under the circumstances , I think this is going to have to do . What is it ? It 's Martin . I thought you told me Martin was dead ? He is . Diana killed him . What ? Stay down back there . We got company . It 's these they want . Let me go to them . - What are those ? - Beryllium crystals . The Mother Ship cannot fire its lasers without them . Then there 's no way you 're going to give those back . Who 's that ? That 's Philip , the Leader 's Envoy . He was my people 's greatest hope . A great warrior turned jurist . He became a man of peace . You could have fooled me . Then he had a brother ? He did . He died in battle . His name was Martin . Thanks , that 's all I need to know . You get back and take care of her . I 've ordered a laser Jeep . Just remember ... I want Donovan for myself . Donovan , you 're dead ! Do you hear me ? You killed my brother and for that ... I kill you ! No doors and no windows . This could get tight . Why does he think you killed his brother Martin ? I don 't know , but he does . Can we run for it ? No way , they 'd just cut us down . So what do we do now ? - We fight . - What about Glenda and my baby ? Better take Glenda and the baby back further into the building . - They 'll be safer there . - Yes , Mike . You might want to go with them . No , I will defend my family . We 'll be glad for the company . You know how to use that thing ? Sure . Easy . - He is hungry , Willie . - I know . There must be some around here . Hush , my pretty baby . Wantu Willie will find you something to eat . I found one ! Are the rodents any good here this time of year ? I do not know , I 'm a vegetarian . I wish I had my blender . Do not worry , it will be fine . He is a big boy . Can we get out of this ? Of course . Mike has rescued us from far worse many times . I hate the killing . Why can there not be peace for my baby ? Would you like one ? They 're delicious . I came for information , not hors d 'oeuvres . Your orders are being carried out this very moment . Philip will die with his boots on , in combat with the enemy . And you 'll be handling the assignment personally ? No . I 've selected an expert in political assassination . Who could be more expert than you ? Angela . Yes , she requested the mission herself . It seems that she and Philip are old friends . - Much like you and I. - Yes , in a way . In a few hours , you 'll be our new commanding officer . It should never have taken this long . I must give you credit , Lydia . You 're more power hungry than I thought . It will be a pleasure to serve under you . Yes . I know I can always count on your loyalty . Let me know the moment Angela returns with the corpse . Philip should have left us when he had the chance . He made a fatal mistake . He trusted you . And you trusted me . Why won 't you let the laser Jeeps destroy the building ? They would also destroy the beryllium crystals . Besides it would be over too quickly for Donovan . And I want kill him slowly with my bare hands . - Then let 's rush the building . - Not yet . I 'm in no hurry . Donovan knows there 's no way out of there . All he can do now is sit there and wonder when he will die . How long do we have to wait ? Don 't worry . Your time for killing will come soon enough . And you 'll get your revenge . Yes . And so will I. Why don 't they do something ? This is driving me crazy . That 's exactly what it 's supposed to do . Look , just stay cool . You don 't want to lose it now . I can 't let them kill my son . I could talk to them . I 'll could give them the crystals . Please ! Please don 't kill my baby . Cover me . There was no reason for that . He was surrendering . He 's still alive . Why did Donovan save him ? I don 't know . He is a strange one . He 's a leader who 's willing to risk his life to save one of ours . In our culture , a leader like that would be shot . Yes , he would . It makes you think . It makes me think he 's either crazy or a fool . Or a man of courage . - I am sorry I lost the crystals . - It 's okay . I know what a guy will do for his kid . Do you ever see your son ? No . If my son survives , I hope he will know men like you . We 're not doing anything special . We 're just fighting to save our homes . Our planet . Your world is a wonder . It is worth fighting for . All right , Angela , the waiting is over . - Prepare to move in . - Yes , sir . Under no circumstances is that child to be harmed . - You can 't expect ... - I can expect ... and order that the child survive . What do you care that a traitor 's son dies ? I don 't make war on children . You have your orders . And remind them Donovan is to be left to me . Do you have children of your own ? No . I mean , except for him . Perhaps one day . There will never be a one day . Yes , there will . You must have faith . What is faith ? I have never heard of it . Faith is when you truly believe ... that what you hope and wish will come true . How can you believe in a hope , a wish ? You must have faith . Here they come again . How you doing ? I 've been worse . I can 't remember when . - I 'll make it . - Sure . We all will . - It 's been fun . - It has for me , too . It 's not over yet . You have the crystals . Let 's finish it . You really do love the killing , don 't you ? That 's what war is all about . People die , civilizations are destroyed . And it 's about revenge . Or have you forgotten the man ... that coldly tortured and murdered your brother ? No ... I haven 't forgotten . Yeah ? - I can obliterate this warehouse . - What 's stopping you ? I don 't wish to see the infant or its parents harmed . It 's you I want . You murdered my brother ! Your brother was my friend . Diana had him killed . You 're a liar . Are you also a coward ? Make your play . Find out . I 'll meet you unarmed . We 'll settle this . Just you and me . If you win , you go free . We all go free . Yes , you have my word . - You can 't trust him . - We have no other choice . Philip was a great warrior on our planet . We 're not on your planet now . We 're on mine . If I die , let them go . - But you can 't ... - That 's an order ! - You chose the wrong person to kill . - Your brother was my friend . Is that why you murdered him ? Martin could never have been your friend . He was no traitor . She had him killed because he was working with us . He was tired of the killing . He thought we could live in peace . He would never turn against his own . You disgust me . - I 'm going to kill all of you . - Put down the laser . - There 'll be no more killing today . - You 're wrong , Philip . You and Donovan will kill each other in combat . - My tribe will finally have revenge . - You 'll never get away with it . - Diana will ... - This is her idea . She killed your traitorous brother . - Forgive me . - I already have . How touching . No one is going to kill my baby . Looks like I owe my life to the people I came to kill . What was done was done because of Martin . - He was my friend . - Yes . - I 'm beginning to believe so . - All he wanted was peace . For now ... there 's been enough killing . There are no words . None are needed . Our planet . Philip 's shuttle should be here any minute . They 'll take you to an island in the South Pacific ... where Diana will never find you . Just right . What are you doing ? Making a bath for the baby . But that 's rock salt and motor oil . Yes , it 's very soothing . Helps keep his scales moist . See , he already loves his ... uncle . Come on . Your Wantu will always protect you . You will never be alone . Neither will I. That must be Angela with Philip 's body . I 'll see to it that you both have a lavish funeral . I wouldn 't joke . You forget who is in command . I couldn 't forget that . Guards , put Adjutant Lydia under arrest . You 've gone insane . What 's the charge ? For ordering the murder of the Inspector General . You have no proof . When Donovan and Philip fight , I 'll make sure there are no survivors . The Leader will believe Philip was killed by the Resistance . Who was killed by the Resistance ? What 's the matter ? You both look surprised to see me . Did you kill Donovan ? Where 's Angela ? I had Donovan in my sights and your escort , Angela , got in the way . She won 't be coming back . Donovan proved to be a formidable adversary . So I 'll be staying a while . It may take a long time . English

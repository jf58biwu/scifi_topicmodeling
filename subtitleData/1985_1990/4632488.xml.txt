Oh-oh . How dare you speak to me that way ? You will address me in the proper manner as Your Royal Highness . I am Princess Vespa , daughter of Roland , King of the Druids . That 's all we needed . A Druish princess . Funny . She doesn 't look Druish . Now we will show her who is in charge of this galaxy . Hold it . I 'll handle this personally . Jawohl , Lord Helmet ! So , Princess Vespa , you thought you could outwit the imperious forces of Planet Spaceball . Well , you were wrong . You are now our prisoner . And you will be held hostage until such time as all of the air is transferred from your planet to ours . She 's not in there . Radar repaired , sir . We 're picking up the outline of a Winnebago .

Keep your seat belts fastened back there . You okay , Princess ? No , you idiot ! Where 'd you learn how to fly ? Okay . Eagle 5 coming in . Left ! Go left ! Right ! I mean right ! Pull up ! Where 're you going ? I am going to tell him off once and for all . Wait . We 'll need him to get us out of here . Called me an idiot ? I 'm going back there and explain a few things to her . Besides , he 's got a sexy voice . He might be cute . You haven 't seen her . I know what she looks like . You 've seen one , you 've seen them all . Cute ? I know these space bums , they 're all alike . Fat , ugly ... Buck-toothed , knock-kneed ... Beer-swilling pigs ! Horse-faced space dogs ! Yeah , well , normally ... That 's gonna leave a mark . Now listen , you ... You listen . On this ship , you 're to refer to me as " idiot , " not " you Captain . " I mean ... You know what I mean . And you will not call me " you . " You will never address me as " you . " You will call me " Your Royal Highness " ! You are a royal pain in the ... Hold it . Time ! What ? May I make a small suggestion ? Any minute now , the Spaceballs will make a major U-turn , head back this way , and make us all dead . He 's right . Let 's go . Wait . My things . Now listen , you royal ... Highness .

Well , what have we got here ? Will you look at her ? Those flashing eyes , those flushed cheeks , those trembling lips . You know something , Princess ? You are ugly when you 're angry . Uh-oh . That 's it . You and your dog are ... Please . Total humans , droids , if I may ? It 's going to be very dark soon . I suggest we find a place to camp for the night . Come , darling . See ? It 's lighter . Oh , yeah . This is the best . I could have carried two or three of these . Have you found them yet ? No , Lord Helmet . They 're still not on the scanner . Well , keep looking for them . Pardon me , sir . I have an idea . Corporal , get me the video cassette of Spaceballs : The Movie . Yes , sir . " The Producers , Twelve Chairs , Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein . " Colonel Sandurz , may I speak with you , please ? Yes , sir . How can there be a cassette of Spaceballs : The Movie ?

It 's that bright blue one right there . See ? Oh , yeah . But it 's so far away . Don 't worry , I 'll get you there . Which one 's yours ? Who knows ? You don 't know where you 're from ? Not really . I was found on the doorstep of a monastery . Monastery ? Where ? Somewhere in the Ford Galaxy . Well , didn 't the monks tell you who your parents were ? They couldn 't . They took a vow of silence . All I got was this . It was around my neck . What is it ? I don 't know . I 've taken it to every wise man in the universe and nobody could tell me what it means . It 's beautiful . You know , I ... It 's beautiful . So , how come you ran away from your wedding ? Well , if you must know , I wasn 't in love with the groom . Why were you going to marry him ? Because I 'm a princess , and I have to marry a prince . And he doesn 't do it for you , huh ? No , he doesn 't do it for me . I really must go back . I shouldn 't have run away . I realize now that love is one luxury You 're probably right . I know now that I must learn to live without love . I guess so . Besides , love isn 't that important . No , it never was . I could be perfectly happy the rest of my life without love . Sure you could . Without physical contact . Yeah . Without being held . Yeah . Or kissed . Abandon ship ! Women and Mawgs first ! We 'll have none of that , mister . How far did he get ? What did he touch ? Nothing happened ! What the hell was that noise ? That was my Virgin Alarm . It 's programmed to go off before you do . You get back to bed , miss . And as for you , sex fiend ... All right . Let 's all just get some sleep . We gotta get moving before dawn . Why so early ? Because we 're in the middle of the desert and we aren 't gonna get very far once that blazing sun gets overhead . Nice dissolve . Water . Oil . Room service . Chief , I 'm dead . I can 't go any further . Come on , Barf , old buddy . Just one more dune to go . No ! You said that three dunes ago . I got no more left . Oh , waiter . Check , please . Must go on .

Let 's get moving . Yes , sir . Driver , prepare to move out . What are you preparing ? You 're always preparing . Just go . Just go . Yes , sir . Sir , shouldn 't you sit down ? What 're they saying ? Well , it 's obvious they want us to go with them . What is this place ? It looks like the Temple of Doom . Well , it sure ain 't Temple Beth Israel . Come on . I think we 'd better follow them . Oh-oh . I think we woke it up . Goodbye , folks ! Let me know how it turns out . Come back here , Dot ! Come on . We gotta keep going . We need you . What 's gonna happen now ? Don 't ask . Maybe it won 't . But what if it does ? I don 't know about you , but I 'm all for leaving . I say we get out of here right now , while the going ... Silence !

Somewhere in the sands of Vega . Tell them to comb the desert . Do you hear me ? Comb the desert ! Yes , sir . Sir ? What ? Are we being too literal ? No , you fool . We 're following orders . We were told to comb the desert , so we 're combing it . Found anything yet ? Nothing yet , sir . How about you ? Not a thing , sir . What about you guys ? We ain 't found shit ! It 's a big mystery . None of the wise men could tell me what it means . Wise men , pshaw . Wise guys , you mean . What do they know ? Here , let me take a look . You can read it ! No , I was just clearing my throat . Here , let me take a ... Oh , yes . Yes , of course ! You understand it ? Yes . What 's it say ? I cannot tell you that now . It shall be revealed to you at the proper time . Great . Come on , don 't be disappointed . Back to your Schwartz training . Here , take the ring . Point it at that big statue . Okay . But I still don 't understand how I 'm going to lift that big statue with this little ring . Never underestimate the power of the Schwartz ! Come on , concentrate ! Here we go ! Concentrate . Lone Starr , you 're doing it ! I can 't believe it ! The Schwartz , it 's working ! Hey , boss , how 'd you do that ? Give me the ring , quick . Upsy-daisy ! Sorry , Barf . Keep searching . It 's no use , sir . We 've searched everywhere . Wait . I feel the presence of the Schwartz . The Schwartz ? Yes . It 's coming from somewhere down there . You 're right , sir . There 's a secret entrance here . And look at this insignia . It 's a " Y. " Yogurt ! I hate yogurt ! Even with strawberries ! I 'll call for the attack squad , sir . No , we can 't go in there . Yogurt has the Schwartz . It 's far too powerful . But , sir , your ring . Don 't you have the Schwartz , too ? He got the upside . I got the downside . There 's two sides to every Schwartz . Then how are we gonna go in there and get her ? We will not go in there . She will come out to us . Vespa , my child . Where are you ? Daddy ? Vespa , it 's your father , King Roland . Come to me . Daddy ? I hear you . Where are you ? Follow my voice . Come to me . Vespa , where are you going ? Vespa , come to me . Daddy . Is it really you ? Yes , my dear . I guarantee it . Would I lie ? Daddy . No , Vespa , don 't ! Fooled you . Take them both aboard and put the Princess in my quarters . Yes , sir . Now she is mine . What 's the matter ? What are they saying ? They 've taken the Princess . Spaceballs . Too late . Don 't worry , boss . We 'll get her back . Thanks for the gas , Yogurt . You 're welcome . And here ! Just in case you get hungry . A fortune cookie ? Yes ! Remember , open it before you eat it . Thanks . We better get going . I wonder , will we ever see each other again ? Who knows ?

You might need it . Thanks . I 'll never forget you . Wish me luck . So , Princess Vespa , at last I have you in my clutches to have my way with you the way I want to . No , please ! Leave me alone . No , you are mine . Not so fast , Helmet . Lone Starr . Yes , it 's me . I 'm here to save my girlfriend . Hi , honey . Now you are going to die . Hey , what 'd you do to my friend ? The same thing I 'm going to do to you , big boy . And you , too . Now , Princess Vespa , at last we are alone . No , I hate you . Leave me alone ! Yet I find you strangely attractive . Of course you do . Druish princesses are often attracted to money and power . And I have both . And you know it . Leave me alone ! No , kiss me ! No ! Yes ! No ! No ! Yes ! Your helmet is so big . Lord Helmet . What ? You 're needed on the bridge , sir ! Knock on my door . Knock next time ! Yes , sir . Did you see anything ? No , sir . I didn 't see you playing with your dolls . Good .

Where did you get that ? All right , I 'll tell ! No , Daddy , no , you mustn 't ! You 're right , my dear . I 'll miss your new nose . But I will not tell him the combination , no matter what . Vey well . Dr. Schlotkin , do your worst . My pleasure . No ! Wait ! I 'll tell . I knew it would work . All right , give it to me . The combination is : One . Two . Three . Four . Five .

I ain 't shooting this thing . I hate guns . My hair . He shot my hair ! You son of a bitch ! Holy shit ! How was that ? Not bad . Not bad for a girl . That was pretty good for Rambo ! Let 's blow this joint . President Skroob ! Salute ! Hail , Skroob . The ship is too big . If I walk , the movie will be over . Sir . Yes ? Never have that damn thing down in front of me . How do I know you 're not making faces at me under that thing ? President Skroob . Yes ? There it is , Planet Druidia . Planet Druidia . And 10,000 years of fresh air . The way he runs things , it won 't last 100 . What ? Preparing ship for metamorphosis , sir . Good . Get on with it . Ready , Kafka ? Look , it 's Spaceball One . They 've reached the air shield . And it 's opening . The ship 's too big . They 'll never get through . How will they get the air out ? I don 't see any hoses or anything . What 's happening ? The ship . Changing . Oh , my gosh . It 's not just a spaceship . It 's a transformer . It 's changing into ... A gigantic ... Maid ! With a vacuum cleaner . So that 's how they 're gonna get the air out . Metamorphosis completed , sir . Spaceball One has now become Megamaid . Good ! Remarkable . Now , commence Operation Vacu-Suck . Suck . Goodbye , little Vespa . My little baby Vespa . The air bag , it 's almost full . What do we do ? We 've gotta act fast . Step one : We reverse the vacuum and blow the air back onto the planet . Step two : We destroy that thing . But isn 't that dangerous ? Extremely . Plus , I don 't know how the hell we 're gonna do it . What about that ring Yogurt gave you ? Oh , yeah . Come on , boss . Give it a shot ! Okay . Here goes nothing . Look at that . Wow ! It 's working . Come on , Schwartz ! Helmet , what 's going on ? Sandurz , what 's going on ? It 's Megamaid . She 's gone from suck to blow . What ? They 're getting all their air back . Do something . Do something ! Do something ! I 'm breathing . Air . Air ! Dim the lights . Dimming the lights . Go to infrared . Going to infrared . Pray to God . Praying to God . Careful . What are you doing ? Scanning . There 's gotta be a self-destruct mechanism somewhere in the central brain area . I think we just found it . Where ? Watch . Bingo ! There it is . It 's right below us . Put her in hover , Barf . Putting her in hover . I 'm going down there . He 's going down there . I wouldn 't . What the hell are you doing ? The Vulcan neck pinch ? No , stupid . You got it much too high . It 's down here where the shoulder meets the neck . Like this ? Yeah . Thanks . Hand print identification , please . Thanks again . Is that you , Mylar ? Who are you ? What are you doing with that ? This ! Sweet dreams . Not so fast , Lone Starr . Helmet . So . At last we meet for the first time for the last time . Before you die , there is something you should know about us , Lone Starr . What ? I am your father 's brother 's nephew 's cousin 's former roommate . What 's that make us ? Absolutely nothing ! Which is what you are about to become . Prepare to die . You have the ring , and I see your Schwartz is as big as mine . Now let 's see how well you handle it . He did it . What ? Shit ! I hate it when I get my Schwartz twisted . Maybe if I put my leg up on yours , we could scoot apart , like ... Good . Yeah , on three . One , two , three , go ! So , Lone Starr , Yogurt has taught you well . If there 's one thing I despise , it is a fair fight . But if I must , then I must . May the best man win . Put her there . The ring ! I can 't believe you fell for the oldest trick in the book . What a goof ! What 's with you , man ? Come on . You know what ? Here , let me give it back to you . Look at that ! You fell for that , too . I can 't believe it , man . So , Lone Starr , now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb . Vey impressive , Lone Starr . Too bad this isn 't the Wide World of Sports . Use the Schwartz , Lone Starr . Use the Schwartz . I can 't . I lost the ring . Forget the ring . The ring is bupkis . I found it in a Cracker Jack box . The Schwartz is in you , Lone Starr . It 's in you . All right . I 'll try . Say goodbye to your two best friends . And I don 't mean your pals in the Winnebago .

Evidently , the notorious gangster became locked in his car and ate himself to death . Coming up , Pongo 's review of Rocky 5,000 . Pongo . Whoever said when you 've seen ... Did you hear that ?

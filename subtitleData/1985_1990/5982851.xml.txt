 [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ dramatic music ] [ phone ringing ] ( female on voicemail ) I can 't come to the phone right now . Leave your name and- - [ phone ringing ] Hello . T.J. , Michael . T.J. , I 'm in big trouble . What ? The joke I gave you bombed ? - T.J. , they 're after me . - Michael , relax . Give me ten minutes . I 'll see you at the club . I 'm not at Bonkerz . I 'll be dead in ten minutes . I 'm at ... Tenthon Hill . Michael ? ( T.J. on phone ) Michael ? Michael ? [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] So , Mr. Funnyman , thinking of doing some more moonlighting ? The only moonlighting I 'm doing is is working at your club , Mr. Dexter . You 've got it all wrong . No , college boy . I got it right . You bought yourself a one-way ticket to the fast lane . What 's that ? It 's something that 'll help you go bye-bye . [ dramatic music ] Michael ? Hey , hey , Michael . Great place for a coffee break here . [ intense music ] Michael ? [ all applauding ] How about that for a start for this evening , folks ? He 's got a real laugh or not , huh ? Big dude , a real big dude , I 'm telling you . Don 't quite your day job . I used to date a girl that was at the .. [ all applauding ] Angel ... you never heard of public relations ? There 's not much I ain 't heard of , Dexter . Maybe , you 've never heard of this . A smile won 't crack your face . That way you won 't scare away the customers . [ upbeat music ] The police will handle this . You should tell them about the club . Michael was my friend . I 'm gonna find out what happened to him . Paramedics said it was his heart . But that was last night . This afternoon the police pathologist said " Drugs induced the heart attack . " This is nuts . Maybe , but we 're after information . You be the straight man . I 'll be the comedian . Okay . So , you don 't mind if I call Lieutenant Harris ? Just in case he needs a little advice from an expert . Clark , we 're investigative reporters , aren 't we ? I don 't ever wanna be standing in the way of common sense . [ indistinct announcement ] Be right back . [ upbeat music ] Hey , there . Table ? Yes , for a friend and a scared to death contestant . Come on . [ indistinct chatter ] I just did . I didn 't know . [ laughing ] Well , stand up and give it to ' em . Thanks a lot , Angel . Michael told me you were an angel . - You knew Michael ? - Yeah , we were classmates . That 's too bad . He was a nice kid . Yeah , everybody liked him . Never made an enemy his whole life that I knew of . - Do you know of anyone ? - No , no . Somebody tell you you 're anything more than a waitress ? I don 't take orders from anybody but you , Dexter . Okay , then just clean up the tables , fill up the glasses . No need to hang out with some college boy . Who does that creep think he is ? Just stay out of it , okay ? I mean , for your own sake . It can be life threatening . That 's what I said , Lana . We 're at Bonkerz . You must be kidding . I knew you were gonna say that . Look , it 's amateur night , and T.J. is a contestant . T.J. ? Oh , I would not miss this for the world . - I 'm on my way . - Okay . Can you do me a favor ? Call Lt. Harris and have him send a patrol car down to the club . Sure , no problem . I 'll see you there . Bye . [ dramatic music ] [ intense music ] Ah , that 's a nice car . Who , who owns that ? You 've got a long nose , pal . - I was thinking , it 's like- - - What 're you doing back here ? I 've got a van parked somewhere . You don 't see van one parked in this lot . Now .. [ dramatic music ] You 're up next , kid . You wanna prepare yourself , there 's a spot behind that curtain . [ indistinct chatter ] ( male # 1 ) Enjoying yourself ? Have a good time . O-oh , hang on to your patience for another few minutes . We 'll be right back . I 've already got a yata-yata-yata . Really lucky I never had acne . Never had facial hair . Just give and take in every situation . Red light .. [ intense music ] Red light you 're seeing .. ( T.J. ) You always pretend that .. So , I 'll have one of my boys transfer what 's outside in your car . No . We don 't wanna transport it . Deliver that when you deliver the rest of it . Okay . I understand you had a problem with your boy last night . No boy of mine . A college kid and part-time comic had dreams of going into business for himself . So we put him to sleep . Permanently . Hey , you ! I guess , uh , can 't read this line . He was listening at the door . Don 't you recognize a comic rehearsing his routine here ? And now , in a few moments the fantastic new talent Mr. T.J. White . He was listening . Guess you don 't like my jokes , huh ? You 'll be on stage in a few minutes , kid . You better be funny . Make sure he meets his commitment . Now , folks , coming up next the fresh new talent , Mr. T.J. White . ( male # 1 ) He 's hot , he 's funny , he 's hilarious . That college boy you were talking to .. ... yeah , T.J. White . Seems kind of nervous backstage . So , I want you to bring him a coke , and load it with this . All of it . What , are you crazy , Dexter ? That stuff packs twice the wallop of PCP . He won 't live long enough to put the glass down . You 'll do it . Or I 'll sting you like very very much . And that can kill you too . Please , Dexter . Please don 't make me do it . Please . Alright . T.J. , the audience is ready . Are you ready ? - Yeah ! - Are you ready ? Alright , this guy is funny . He 's funnier than that tie you 're wearing . We 're gonna bring him out . - Here , this might help . - Thanks , Angel . Guy that came in with me , tell him something , okay . Tell him that .. [ people laughing ] ( male # 1 ) Here 's the big moment . Now , how about a nice round of applause for my man , Mr. T.J. White . Come on , give it up . Hi , everyone . ( all ) Hi . It 's great to be here . I feel very lucky . Actually , I 'm a very lucky person in general . I ... I never had facial hair or acne . [ intense music ] Hey , I like your shirt , guy . That brings to mind , cheap oil paintings . [ music continues ] And black light . No reason to get upset . We 're in a comedy club , right ? Aren 't we lucky ? ( Michael ) T.J. , I 'm in big trouble . Well , here we all are . And the bad . Ugly , I mean ugly . ( Michael ) T.J. , they 're after me . I 'll be dead in ten minutes . What are you staring at ? ( Angel ) Just stay out of it , okay ? Beam me up , Scotty . Beam me up . Uh , jokes , jokes . We need some comedy . Tell some jokes here . Got to be funny . I got my jokes here . Ha ha . Jokes . A refrigerator . Think about a refrigerator . I , I have guacamole and it 's green now . And .. [ blabbering ] How come the college boy isn 't taking his final bow ? I don 't know , Dexter . Gave it to him just like you told me . Just what I thought . Don 't be mad . I 'll make it up to you . Not this time , sweets . Put here in the storeroom . I 'll take care of her later . [ intense music ] Nurse . Nurse , nurse , nurse ! ( Michael ) I 'll be dead in ten minutes . ( Angel ) It can be life threatening , life threatening . And you have a familiar face . Aren 't you here to save my act ? ( Dexter ) So we put him to sleep ... permanently . Oh , take my life , please . ( Michael ) T.J. , they 're after me . ( Dexter ) Permanently , permanently . [ screaming ] Come on , T.J. , I 'm gonna get you out of here . Man in the mirror . I saw the man . Don 't try to talk . Don 't talk . [ heart beating ] I saw the man and the two and everything . Gotta get you to a hospital . Since you 're so curious , college boy , I 'll show you . Show you the whole operation . After you . [ dramatic music ] Take a good look , college boy . It 's the last thing you 'll ever see . Now , put him in a chair . So , that 's how you did it to Michael ? Wicked stuff . Two minutes after contact with the skin it 's absorbed into the blood stream . Too bad , T.J. We 'll never know what you could 've done up there . Alright , move them . [ alarm ringing ] [ dramatic music ] [ ringing continues ] - Are you alright ? - I think so . - T.J. , T.J. , I 'm so sorry . - He 'll be alright . I checked him out earlier . I need you to take him out front and wait for me . [ dramatic music ] Please , please , everyone , there 's no need to panic . The fire has been contained . Hey . [ saxophone music ] Run him down ! T.J. , look out ! [ dramatic music ] Ah , why did I do that ? [ siren blaring ] You 'll find all the evidence you need in the trunk , officer . T.J. , T.J. You okay ? [ upbeat music ] Clark didn 't tell me why he couldn 't be here tonight . But you know how Clark is sometimes . - I wish Angel were here . - I know . She 's on the way back . In a couple of weeks you can visit her at the rehab clinic . Yeah . Now , go out there and break a leg . [ all applauding ] I 'd like to introduce to you one of the newer upstart here . Please put your hand together for my man , Mr. T.J. White . Thank you , man . Hi , everybody . I 'm really luck to be here at Bonkerz tonight . In fact , I 'm lucky to be anywhere , any night . You are looking at a young man who has been land mined trash compacted , dropped off a 20 storied building sniper attacked , hurricane abused mowed over by a limo , drugged and beat unconscious . And I 'm not complaining or anything , but I am learning . [ all applauding ] [ " Adventures of Superman " theme by Leon Klatzkin ] Captioned by Grant Brown

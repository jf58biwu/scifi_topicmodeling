Son , you may have just saved my life . [ gunshot ] [ screaming continues ] [ gunshot ] [ theme music ] [ laughing ] ( male # 1 on recorder ) I 'm your guide . Let me show you the way .. [ dramatic music ] [ upbeat music ] [ indistinct chatter ] What do you mean we 're not dressed right ? [ crowd booing ] Try to lighten up Lana , huh . You might decide this is the real you . If Clark saw me , I wouldn 't hear the end of it . What do you expect ? Clark 's radical fashion statement 's a pair of socks that don 't match . At least he 's not here with frizzed out hair . I feel like such a dork . We 're not dorks , we 're punks . And don 't forget why we 're here . Because somebody opened up his big mouth and promised the Shuster Herald a photo spread .. ... about what goes on in the mysterious Black Flamingo . Who knew they 'll make a big deal out of three words " No cameras allowed ? " That Monster bouncers were frisking people at the door ? Or blue hair would make my scalp itch ? You know , you ask a lot of questions . [ bike engine revving ] [ dramatic music ] [ engine idling ] Back on the bike , slick . We don 't like you . You or your ugly snake . I don 't care what you say to me , alright . My snake here , he 's kind of sensitive . You have to apologize to him . Slick , we 'll make you eat that snake . You 're out of here .

Those two men that just walked through here one of them knew you . Who were they ? That was Rocker Dane . He owns the Black Flamingo . What do you do for him ? I dance for him . And you ? What is your story ? You see , three days ago a punk rocker tried to kill a senator . That 's unfortunate . Well , he was brainwashed , the kid was and he was wearing one of these . We 've dispensed hundreds of these . So many questions . Are you a policeman or something ? Maybe I 'm a friend . Some free advice , friend . Go . The Black Flamingo 's not a safe place to be . Dasvidaniya . Dasvidaniya . [ upbeat music ] Hey , babe , wanna see my van ? Only in your dreams , babe . Trust me , I grow on a woman . Then , that makes you a fungus . Disappear . Lana , you wanna dance ? Um .. - Both of you . - Both of us ? - Leave . - Why should we ? Ow ! How did you know about my camera ? You know , you don 't belong with these people anymore than we do . Who are you ? And why are you here ? [ intense music ] ( male # 1 on speakers ) Welcome to the barrage . Open your minds .. ... and let me in . I will be your guide . Let me show you the way . The way to function .. ... to think .. ... to feel .. ... to long .. ... to hate .. ... to live .. ... to die .. ( male # 1 on speakers ) Welcome to the barrage . You 're listening to eight tracks of my voice digitally altered by a secret process that put them on a frequency far beyond the range the conscious mind is able to comprehend . The subconscious mind , however , picked up every word . Had you been trapped like the test subject we sent after Senator Roker , you too would have become our mindless slave . Most ingenious , Mr. Dane . Subliminal mind control . Extremely efficient . Terrorism is a precise science , Mr. Agar . To function in today 's world our methods must be efficient . ( male # 1 on speakers ) Welcome to the barrage . Open your mind .. ... and let me in . I 'll will be your guide . My success rate here improved once I provided a visual stimulus . It gives the subject something to focus on while they 're being indoctrinated . Well , I always found the Flamingo a bit garish . But ... it seems to fulfill the function . ( male # 1 on speakers ) Whatever I ask .. ... you will do it . Because you love me . Because you are devoted to me . Because we are family . That 's the beauty of it , you see . The subjects don 't realize they had been indoctrinated . Everyone on that floor will be mine to command . Yet , they will leave with no memory of the Flamingo . Think about it , Agar . The power to mobilize America 's youth into an army of voice-activated terrorists . Niet . We will not let it happen . Dane , what is the meaning of this ? It seems my dear Natasha 's , true loyalties have never been in my best interests . I must admit , darling , I was quite surprised when I was informed by my sources that I had been compromised by a Russian spy who was working hand in hand with American intelligence . Terrorists like you are the enemies of all countries , Dane . I 've seen all I need to see . [ cocks gun ] Shut it down now . She means it , Dane . She 's going to shoot . No , she won 't . [ in digitally altered tone ] Natasha .. ... hand me the gun . You 've been very bad . Go stand over there , and wait to die . ( Dane on speakers ) You will do it . Because you are devoted to me . Because we are a family . [ intense music ] Open your minds .. ... and let me in . Welcome to the barrage [ upbeat music resumes ] Of course she had no inkling . I processed her several months ago . In fact , the same day I found out she was a spy . Amused me no end using her to pass on misinformation to not one , but two major superpowers . Naturally , she had no warning tonight was the test at the Flamingo . Hmm , your reputation has been well earned , Mr. Dane . After tonight , my clients will be most anxious to do business with you . ( Dane ) Good . - Who 's he ? - I 'm trouble . Only one of us is gonna walk out of here tonight . You 're right . [ gunshot ] Finish him . [ machine gun firing ] [ theme music ] You ! Me . [ whooshing ] ( Dane ) Children . There 's an intruder amongst us . Superboy . Welcome to my game . Superboy is not a member of our family . He wants to hurt us . Superboy must be stopped , children . You must kill him . Do it for me . Don 't let him destroy our family . Kill him . [ clamoring ] [ upbeat music ] Finish him . Children , he 's over here ! That 's right , I 'm over here . [ music continues ] Not me , you idiots ! Superboy ! Attack Superboy ! You programmed them to mindlessly obey . They 'll kill you to get to me . There 's only one way you can save yourself . Stop , children . Stop , children . Stop ! Superboy is not your enemy . There is no family . I 'm not your guide . Your mind belongs to you . Only ... to you . [ gasping ] [ indistinct chatter ] Excuse me , will you guys watch him for me ? Superboy . In my country we heard many stories about your wondrous powers . Fortunately for all of us , they are true . [ speaking Russian ] [ speaking Russian ] I didn 't know you spoke Russian . I didn 't know you were into the club scene . When did you get here ? Where 's the biker ? Looks like he left his friend behind . Let me have him . It 's a good bet tonight 's entire activities are on this microcassette . The snake ? Even the snake is here undercover ? He knew no one would search his friend . Very clever . I wish I could thank him . Yeah . Me , too . Oh , my hair will never be the same again . What 's your problem , T.J. ? A night at the Flamingo wasn 't that bad . You got some great pictures . ( T.J. ) You know what your problem is , Lana ? Ever since that biker disappeared you haven 't been able to get him outta your head . Is that a fact ? He 's just a baby , Clark . Just a baby ? You could 've fooled me . Get it off ! - I think he likes you . - Oh ! Ugh ! You think his daddy 'll come back for him one day ? ( Clark ) You never know , Lana . You never know . Captioned by Grant Brown

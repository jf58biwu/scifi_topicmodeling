 The dragon pearl ? The money ? Who are you ? Me ... I 'm David Ko , of course . David Ko is less than 5 ft. tall . You want to fake him ? Chop off your head first ! What you want is the pearl , and this one is real . You 're right , the pearl is a fake , but not this gun . Don 't move , that 's it , don 't move ... This way it 's not going to move , Wisely . How come you know my name ? You don 't have to know how I knew . Mr. Howard Hope is waiting for you . Take home as your souvenir ! How are you ? Mr. Wisely . Hope you don 't mind me reading your notes . I 'm Howard Hope . Our lady friend just ruined my whole day 's effort . And without my permission , you read my notes . If you were me , would you mind ? You believe that extraterritorial looks so ugly ? This is creativity , and it 's called imagination . If you do come across them . Please take a picture for me . I come to ask you to find someone for me . You make a mistake , I write science fictions . Not classified ads for want . You don 't have to do that to find David Ko , do you ? I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . David Ko has been missing for 3 years . You and David are old pals . You two grew up together . His father , Prof. Ko , treated you as his son . So you 've done some research . What does David has to do with you . I can 't tell you right now . Ok , come again when you 're ready to tell me . Howard Hope is one of the richest in the world . He retreated to Egypt many years ago and never shows up in public any more . Why does he want to find David ? What a coincidence . Just as I said I couldn 't find David he finds me instead . The legend said that a dragon had once flown over Nepal and left a pearl , which could intelligence . Of course , many people believe it is ridiculous . David 's father has spent half of his lifetime to find this dragon pearl . When he died , all of his work were passed to David . I believe Howard Hope wants to find David must have something to do with the dragon pearl . David finds me all so suddenly . Wonder what kind of trouble he runs into this time - sir ... buy a mask . - No , thanks . It 's beautiful ... Really beautiful . Buy one ! Here ! Keep it ... You 're generous , thank you , bye-bye ! I 'm David ! Over there ! Let 's run , quick ! Get them ! Move , don 't block the way ! Follow me , this way ! I was afraid that you wouldn 't recognize me . Who are you ? Me ... I am David . Still kidding me after so many years ? You don 't look like this in the past ? When you 're doing fine , no one can find you . You find me so urgently , you must be in some trouble . Who says it 's trouble ? Now even the big guy need my help . You know who he is ? It 's Pak Kei-wei of the Ching Gang . This guy is really some big shot . He has already deposited $ 2,000,000 in the bank . Too bad it 's his own account . Such a big deal , sure I have to count you in . No more bullshit , you could not find it ? Don 't underestimate me , I 've already found the pearl . You find it ? Where is it ? It 's in this mountain village . Too bad it is in the possession of an evil religion . As soon as they discover me , they 'll try to kill me . Were those monks after you ? They aren 't bald . Yeah , seems that they have hair . Balds aren 't always monks , then monks aren 't all bald . What 's the matter ? Sorry , I thought you 're someone else . You scare me ! For you ... and you . That settles it . No , look , even my instrument was broken . How am I going to find my next job ? Enough for a new one ? 12th Dec , the new master shall emerge . The old master has passed away . With the aid of the pearl , I 've made it through . Today , is the only day in your life that you can see the pearl . So here I bless each and everyone of you . You aren 't one of us , what are you doing here ? Catch him ! Hold it ! Catch him ! Hold it ! Don 't be mistaken , I come here to find a friend . My foot ! Little master is in danger ! Be careful , little master ! - Hang on , little master . - Take care of little master . Stop him ! Catch him ! Use the net . Help me . Some kind of mass , ha ? Let 's get away first . Let 's go ! There ! You go this way , you go that way , the rest follow me . Wait ... Let 's take a rest , it 's Ok now . I always know you can straighten it out . What the hell were you doing indeed ? Don 't worry , there will be advantage for you . To hell I believe you . Run ! Horses ! Over there ! Lend it to me , will you ! What ? The horse is mine . Go ! I beg you . Wisely . Come back ! Help me ! Come back . Quick ! Give me back my horse . It 's bumpy . Hold tight . Quick , they 're right behind , Help ! Get down . - Down . - What ? David , are you alright ? No problem . Beware what 's behind you . Get on the plane ? Start the engine . Hold on tight . Who stabs my back ? - Damn it ! - My dragon pearl ! Coconut ? Go ! Why are you so nervous ? There 's a whole box at the back . You really scare me . It 's all yours They 're gone ... You lied to me and used me to distract those monks . So that you could steal the pearl . If I said I need your help to steal something . You 're so straight ... no . You 're so smart , sure you won 't do it . Don 't we make it now ? You did ! No , I 've already counted you in . Otherwise , how can we say we are pals ? When we returned , Mr. Pak Kei-wei will take care of us . Even if those monks follow us all the way to Hong Kong . We 've nothing to be afraid of , don 't we ? I don 't find those monks evil at all . It 's you . What is it ? What ? Yes , why is it like this ? Exactly what has happened ? Smoke ! What are we going to do ? It 's out of control . No reason at all . It 's too late , there 's a river down there , let 's jump . What 's holding me back , what is it ? David ... - The dragon pearl - has been stolen by your friend and he has left Nepal already . Good guess , except he died in a plane crash . I didn 't guess it . Do you believe in the 3rd eye ! Extra-sensory-perception . That 's right , it 's the ESP that you 're now thinking of . All our masters have our 3rd eye opened by the pearl . I 'm too young I can only feel those that are near . And sometimes I can 't feel anything at all . Your friend has left , and I can do nothing about it . is David still alive ? In your world , the pearl can only cause trouble . But to our religion , it is everything . I do wish that you can help us to find the pearl . Actually it has nothing to do B219with me . I know you 've nothing to do with this and you were framed by your friend only . He heard it again ? In this distance , of course I can feel it . But sometimes I make mistakes . I also figure out you 're an righteous man , and you 're going to help us . is my feeling correct ? If my friend is really still alive . I 'll make him return the pearl to you . Then I will wait for you here . In today 's world , ESP has already been proven to its existence . But for a five years old kid , saying that he acquires this ability through the pearl . is really hard to believe . Nevertheless , I still wish that David is alive . I am Howard Hope , remember me ? If you don 't remember , it 's alright . Confused ? I ain 't confused , Mr. Wisely . I 'm talking to you via Tele-intercom . Where are you ? I 'm always in Egypt . Last time you said I could find you when I 'm ready . Now I can tell you . But to avoid being overheard by someone else . I 've sent my assistant to talk to you in person . however , I 'd still like to say hello to you first . Wishing our co-operation will be successful . Living in a yatch , you 're pretty fancy , ha ? Why are you sailing my boat out to sea ? I don 't want anyone else to hear our conversation . I come to Hong Kong to get the pearl . Wisely , you should know where David is now . I 'm looking for him as well . Wisely , I know you 'll be fine . It 's all settled now , I 'm busy studying the pearl . The big guy is treating me as his brother . Come and see me . There 'll be advantages for you . See you soon ! This is for you . Since you know David so well . It 's easy for you to make him return the pearl to us . The pearl belongs to him ? That 's right , it belongs to his ancestors . Wrong , the pearl belongs to a very old religion . I 'll go find David to return the pearl . But not to you , I 'll send it back to the monks . How much they offered you , we 'll pay 10 times more . It 's free of charge , and I bear my own expenses . is $ 3,000,000 . Enough ? I mean US dollars . I believe our discussion ends here ? Just name your price , Wisely . Where do you want me to drop you ? If Mr. Hope didn 't ask me to come . I wouldn 't even bother to deal with you this way . I don 't know what this woman is going to do next . But she doesn 't look she 's easy to handle . She 'll soon find out where David is . I must be ahead of her . Thanks ! Terrific . isn 't he Wisely ? Pardon me , Mr. Pak , I didn 't mean to ... Excuse me , Miss , I don 't know you are . You did it on purpose . I was only playing not for real ? Let me explain , I don 't know you are a lady . Still take my advantage ? Stay there , I can handle him . OK I lose , Miss Sue Pak . How come you know my name ? Who told you ? Why are you here ? Are you looking for me ? If you are , why don 't you say so ? is it because you want to try out my martial arts ? I 'm asking you questions why don 't you answer ? You asked me so many questions in such a short time . I need some time to think them over . Oh yes , one has to lie down to think . In fact , I came to look for your brother . I am Wisely . So you think the whole world knows you , Wisely ? Pak Sue ... Miss Pak , you name is really special . Can I borrow it ? What , you want to change your surname ? No , I like to use it for my heroine in my new book . The leading character ... I got it , all the leading role 's name in your books were borrowed just like this . No , this is the first time I used this idea . So you admit is a trick ? Brother , this is Wisely . Wisely , adventurer , sci-fi writer intelligent and heroic man , it 's my honor to meet you . Pak Kei-wei , God Father of the Ching Gang . Chief of the underground . Go on flattering one another . Wisely , nice to meet you , bye-bye . Yes , David said that in the Himalayas . Without your help lt 's impossible for him to get the pearl . This is a $ 300,000 cheque to cover your expenses . Mr. Pak , I came here is to ask David for the pearl . Mr. Wisely , do you realize how much time and money . I 've spent on this project . I sponsored David to find this dragon pearl , and provided him with everything for his research . What does it have to do with you ? You just wish to keep it for yourself . This pearl is a matter of life and death to a religion . and to a lot of men . Take care of your life first . You 'll live longer if your mind your own business . Yes ... I won 't give up just like that . Mr. Pak , look at me . Now the monks wouldn 't recognize me ! I 'm not as handsome as when I 'd my beard and long hair . I 'm interested in the pearl , not your face . Have you got the analysis report yet ? Not yet ! I 've tried all test , but it has no response at all . I don 't even know what it is made of ? So far you 've spent a huge portion of my money . And yet not even a report is finished . I always hate being cheated . Mr. Pak , you must be kidding , I wouldn 't dare ... I always hate kidding . You said you needed one year to find the pearl . I trusted you . But you 've spent 3 years . Then you said you needed Wisely again I trusted you . In face you set him up . I ... You told me , if it 's not Wisely 's help . It 's impossible to make it . - You told me gave him some credits . - Yes . I prepared a $ 300,000 cheque for him . But he asked me to return the pearl instead . I really don 't know he would ... Forget it , I don 't come here for your explanation . Not until you find out anything about this pearl . You are going to remain in this room Wow , God Father is a hard man . Isn 't it like in jail . So she 's so many of my novels . I thought you were nude . Why are you here ? I don 't come here for you . So you are not here for me . I am looking for David helped your brother to rob the pearl from a religion which directly affects the fate of the religion . I 've promised their little master that I 'm going to return it to them . Regard you argued with my brother outside the door . I agree that he is pushing too far . Hide in my bed . Who is it ? It 's me . Come in , brother ! Already in bed ? Aren 't you used to read ? You read this guy 's novel again . Did Wisely say anything to you ? Not at all , why do you ask ? I was afraid that you 'll be cheated by others Cheated ? You know that whoever cheats me . Will be fooled . Fooling others is wrong . I know , brother , I can tell right from wrong . In face , I 'm not happy in the way you got this pearl . For years , father had tried every mean to find this . I 've to accomplish what he 'd failed . If he knew how you got this pearl . You 're in big trouble . Sue , do you feel that with a father of such caliber , is in fact a burden ? Go to sleep ! Sleep early . Reading too much of these will led you to insanity . Wake up , stupid ... wake up . Are you asleep ? Hey ... you haven 't fainted , are you ? Wake up ! Want my mouth-to-mouth resuscitation ? Wisely , you better leave ! Wait , let me ask you lf the Ching Gangs ' emblem is stolen What will happen to Ching Gang ? No more credibility and unity For them the dragon pearl has the same function . I understand your brother 's feeling . It 's not easy being a great man 's children . But he shouldn 't do whatever he wanted . To prove himself , don 't you agree ? Please don 't argue with him face to face . Then help me secretly ! Wake up ... Are those monks here ? I told you to return the pearl to those monks . What ? They will give us credits ? Bullshit , where 's the pearl ? Miss Pak , you make the decision ! Hand it to him . You are going to be responsible for this . Quick , let 's go lf you do this , please might as well shoot me . Miss Pak , you know your brother 's temperament . If he takes the pearl and leaves me here . I 'll be a dead man . Since I 'll be dead anyway , I 'd rather go with you . It 's all your fault , and you have to bear the consequence . Wisely , I know it 's my fault , I sold you out . Are we pals ? Then shoot me . Couldn 't careless . Take the gun , hold me as your hostage . Take it . Wisely , you aren 't kidding with me , are you ? Do I look like it ? Brother , don 't come any closer . Wisely has promised not to hurt me . Let them go ! OK , I 'll let you go ! But if you dare to lay one finger on my sister I 'll guarantee that you can never hide from me ! Let them go ! Go ! Don 't look at me , he got the gun ! Shut up ! Don 't come close ! This car , get in ! Go ! Smart of you to use this trick to escape . Look ! What is it ? Let 's go ! Open fire ! My hand ... You 're so stupid . What is it ? Grenade ! They 're right behind . You brother is a cruel man sending these commandos . My brother knows I 'm here he wouldn 't send his men . He wouldn 't . Who sends them ? I know . Oh , no ! It 's a cul-de-sac ! Look ! There 's a cliff on the side . What are we going to do ? There 's a spur in the front , let 's bet on this ! Jump ! Up ! Wisely , help me ! Don 't hurt him , Mr. Hope wants him alive . Hey , you 're pressing me again . Sorry ! What are we going to do ? Go and find Howard Hope directly . Howard Hope ? What does he have to do with this ? Those are his men . They 'll return to Egypt immediately . Great , I 've never been to Egypt before . Sue , I can 't take you there . In that case , I will take you . It 's too dangerous over there . Then it 's even more important for me to take you . Stop kidding . Do I look kidding with you ? Once I make a promise , I 'll keep it . Am I a irresponsible woman ? No ! Then you ? I really can 't take you with me . - Sue ! - No matter how you beg me . I wont ' take you . I really want you to come , but it 's too dangerous . Ok , you don 't have to beg , I 'll take you . Why such a long face ? Why camel , when we can take a cab . Come on ! This is more romantic . Hey ... get up ! It 's now that 's the most romantic . So this is really romantic . Exactly who is this rattlesnake that you mentioned ? I 've heard that in Egypt , this guy has all the connections . But I 've never met him before . Don 't worry , as long as he is in this business . He is going to give us some respect . When we get there , I 'll show him our Gang 's badge and everything will be alright . Look , a Chinese archaeology team . Folks ... How are you ? Nothing ! Look , the sun , it 's so beautiful . Look like it is going to drop into sand . Watch out we don 't get slip into the sand first . Do you know under this desert . is the old city of Cala . If we step on any quicksand . You 'll be lucky if you died of suffocation instantly . Or you may find yourself trapped in the city of life . Do you have anything against romanticism ? Are we leaving tomorrow ? Even it is a ruin up there I 'm still going back . It 's my homeland anyway . Are you sure you want to go with me ? When my home was at war , I decided to leave . As I got here , my ship crashed but I didn 't mind . Only I can 't get rid of that home-sick feeling . You 've already seen my miseries . So why follows my footsteps to be an immigrant ? I won 't be afraid as long as I am with you . Maybe we humans are easier to be satisfied . I wonder if she is a woman slave ? What ? You want to know how much and buy one ! No ! The sky is our father , the land is our mother . The world united together , Pak Sue pays her regards . I believe he has nothing to do with the Ching Gang . Let me try the badge of the Koi Gang . You are member of the Koi Gang ? So we are both Chinese , how nice , how nice . I came from Hong Kong too , look ! Buddies , if you need anything , just let me know . We need your help to find a person . A man or a woman ? A man ! A man , no problem . You prefer fat guy or thin guy . I ain 't gay , I want to find a man called Howard Hope . You too don 't be mistaken . You too don 't be mistaken . Haven 't seen Chinese for so long , let 's take a picture . I 'll take care of it . Come back in 3 hours and I 'll be ready for you . Thanks . I wonder how much does one cost ? You really want to buy one ? I 'm only kidding . That guy is going to betray us . How do you know ? He is no rattlesnake , he 's a snake with 2 heads . He had betrayed one of my friends . Who had to take the midnight express to Hong Kong . So you did this B614on purpose letting him to betray us . Smart , in figuring out such simple problem . Hey , you 're mean . You 're so humble in your books . Writer , writer , writing is a creative matter . Hey , if you 're going to use my name in your new book . How are you going to write about me ? I 'll write you as a more tender , more mature . More intelligent , more feminine . More friendly , more ... So you mean I ain 't tender enough , mature enough . - Feminine enough - Look ! Pal ! When he mentioned your name , I knew it 's my chance . Few Chinese are as smart as I am . See how smart this guy looks . But anyway , I fooled him and I took this picture . And here 's the picture . I 've already drawn you the map . Why insist on taking me the mountain village . If those monks see me , they will kill me . Go ! I really can 't go , Madam . I have to go . Boss , I betray my own folks . Simply to show my loyalty . But now , my mouth is dry . If there is any water , it will be terrific ! I 'm rich . Have you seen Howard Hope ? Yes , I have seen him . Have you seen a shorty ? Yes . Have you seen a ball-like object . One ? It used to be in pair . How many guard are there ? Many , and they all have guns . Hey , you sound as though you want to find him ! Now . What you say is rubbish . Then just ask one question . What ? Ask me where he is ! Where ? He 's gone , through the rear gate . Where to ? What 's there for me ? Wait , I 'll tell you . They 're going to take that shorty to some mountain . Mountain village ... this is for you . They 're coming ! Who are they ? Certainly not one of us . It is shake badly . Are you wearing any dentures or wig . No ! That 's better ! The car can 't go up anymore . Boss , what 's next ? - Get rid of them ! - Yes ! Great , my brother is here . Now , I can only kiss your hair . Wisely ! You go first , let me handle my brother . Brother , it 's not his fault . You get back ! Brother , this is not fair . You 've a gun , he hasn 't . We 'll meet again in David 's cottage in Nepal . Take care of yourself . I 'll be alright . Wisely , don 't run , go after him ! Brother ! Quick , drive faster ! Grasp my hand . Wisely ! Brother , you are always impulsive . I asked him to take me here . He respects me all the way . I 've said I 'd kill him myself . Yet , he saved me instead . What did you say ? He saved me . Where is he ? I say where is he ! Wisely ! Don 't go , it 's quicksand out there . Sue , don 't be like this . Sue , is there anything ... He said he 's going to be alright . Sue , where 're you going ? I promised to help , I 'm going to do so till the end . Ok , I 'll go with you . You two get off . - Watch out for anyone suspicious - Yes ! Brother , do you think that child-monk is in trouble ? I hope he is alright . Otherwise who is going to take us to the village ? Oh , no , there 's disaster . Master , what have you sensed ? Master , we are Wisely 's friend . Trust us , take us to your village ! Kid ! Hey , you ! Stop , I don 't come here for a fight . Too late . - Ah Hing , catch that kid ! - Yes ! Stop fighting ! Stop ! Quick . Get away ! - What are you going ? - Watch out ! Take it up . - What are you going ? - Go away . No gun ! Quick ! Wonderful ! Brother , please stop . Wisely ! The Pharaoh said I ain 't qualified to be his mummy . No one is allowed to go in . No ! Little master is sitting at the river bank . Let 's go down ! - Little master . - Little master , you alright ? Our religion is destined to an end , it 's useless . No matter what , let 's go up to the village first . Yes ! It 's so cruel . Wisely , what kind of weapon burned them like that ? We better be careful . Enter Holy Land ... So this is the place where all of their masters died . Master , I 'm useless . And can 't prevent our religion from termination . Please forgive me . Animal , he 's inhuman ! He 's no human . David Are you alright ? You 're still alive ? He didn 't kill you ? Because I didn 't block his way home , so I 'm alive . That dragon pearl is a computer . What are you saying ? It 's not the kind of computer men use . It 's a computer that can communicate with our brains . No , no , adult brains are too corrupted to be influenced . It can only influence infant 's brain . He must be scared . No , it may be true . It 's true , lt 's truly true . Over there ! Drop your guns . Wisely , before this place is totally destroyed . You guys must leave quickly . What are you ? Why did kill you all those monks . I 'm not one of you . Listen , I 'll kill whoever tries to stop me . You 're too cruel . You slaughter animals for food , isn 't it cruel ? So what 's cruelty when I only killed those monks ? Humans are different from animals . Our intelligence excel yours . Killing you is similar to your killing of animals . You are on our soil . And we do have our law and order . Robbing the dragon pearl is already illegal , And killing so many people is even more unforgivable . Robbing the dragon pearl ? Let me tell you . What you call " Dragon Pearl " is a solar pilot device left by our ancestors . It 's also the only thing that can lead me home . You thought it 's scared , it 's a mere misunderstanding . Actually , it should be ours . He seems to be telling the truth . - You bring me back their lives . - Little master . Guardians ! Don 't go , there 's no way you can win him . Get lost ! The pearl ! Come with me ! the dragon pearl ! Hold me tight ! So you are satisfied , now , he is dying . Give him back , please , it belongs to him . So our religion is a mistake . - How come the ground is moving ? - Come on . We are moving towards the mountain . Jump to the other side . Ah Hing ! Go quickly ! He 's going down , we better go up . Earthquake ! Earthquake ! Run ... quick ! Look ... they 're heading to us ! Look , be careful ! A way out ! It 's a dragon ! Dragon is not new in our legends . It has acquired many vivid descriptions . Although there is no way to prove its existence . I believe these must have their grounds . Had our ancestors actually seen the same dragon we 're seeing now ? Many myths and legends on this earth , are they traces of those outer space visitors ? With our limited intelligence to explore the universe . Can we really find the answer ?

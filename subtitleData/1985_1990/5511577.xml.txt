 Good evening , I 'm Howard K. Smith , and this is the state of the war tonight . In an unprecedented show of solidarity ... an integrated force of black and white South Africans ... staged a daring hit-and-run attack on the Visitor processing plant ... at Johannesburg . More than 200 people were rescued . Philadelphia resident Stuart Kaminsky was awarded ... the Freedom Network 's Medal of Valor ... for his courage in operating an underground railroad ... between Atlanta and the City of Brotherly Love . To date , he has single-handedly saved more than 300 people ... from the Georgia work camps . Here at home in the US , in Los Angeles , shocking news ... as Nathan Bates , the power broker behind the Open City , has died . Gunned down and badly wounded three weeks ago ... while negotiating a prisoner exchange ... Bates is survived only by a son . But the burning question at this point becomes : What will be the fate of Los Angeles ? Honey , I need a doctor . All right , take it easy now . I 'm gonna get you some help . Mom ! It 's all right , Johnny , Mama 's gonna be all right . Alan , it 's time . - We gotta find a doctor . - I know . All right . Johnny , you listen to me now . I gotta find a doctor for your mom . You gotta be the man around here till I get back . Can you do that ? - Yes , Dad . - Alan , please don 't leave . Please , it 's the only way . I promise you , I 'll be back . - I 'm counting on you now , boy . - I 'll take care of Mom . I love you . I love you , too . Will you guard the fort now ? Take care of your mom , I 'll be right back . We are moving to control every sector of the city . The only real opposition has come ... from a number of isolated pockets of resistance . Nevertheless , within a matter of hours ... all of Los Angeles will be under our control . I 've been searching the vicinity of what used to be the Club Creole . The Club Creole ? The humans destroyed that , didn 't they ? Yes . But they 're so inefficient . Consider it done . There is one thing that troubles me , though . What 's that ? I 'm told that Charles had no knowledge of the attack ... until after we had already begun . Sometimes in order to get something done ... one must simply take the initiative . Had I gone through channels and waited for Charles ... the attack might have failed . I 've been looking for someone I can trust ... to oversee Los Angeles for me . My orders are to report all progress to Charles . Yes , of course . But Charles has bigger things on his mind than Los Angeles . He could never reward you the way I could . I exist to serve in any way that you see fit . All things in good time , Lieutenant . Help ! No , please , you can 't harm me . I 'm insolent . I 've seen you on TV . You 're the Resistance , right ? No . Aren 't we all ? All I 've got to do is to find Julie Parrish . With the amount of control the Visitors have on the city ... everyone 's afraid to stand up to them . - Everyone but us . - When they 've finished ... there 'll be only be two kinds of humans left around here : Resistors and Collaborators . Any word from the other groups ? They 've been hit hard . They 're regrouping . We should do the same thing . I don 't know . Right now , one place is as good as another . The Visitors are trying to soften us up , move us out into the open . I think our best bet is to sit tight and see what our options are . - You think we should stay here for now ? - Right . Just don 't get too attached to anything . Julie ! We caught this guy outside . He claims to be a friend of yours . Alan ? You know this guy ? Yes , I went to school with his brother . What 're you doing here ? Look , I need help . My wife 's having a baby . The Visitors have taken over all the hospitals . Where is she ? In a bombed-out store at Fourth and Highland . I left my son with her . Get your wife here , we 'll help her . She 's already in labor . There 's no way she can make it here . Just tell me what I need to know to deliver the baby myself . I 'm going with you . He needs me . Wait . Everything 's up for grabs out there . We 've lost too many good people to take another chance right now . No way , I 'm going with him . I 'll go with her . All right . Here , take this . And take the van . You might as well be of some help . - You take this . - Thanks . Let 's go . No ! It 's okay , Mom , I did it . Honey , you mustn 't scare me like that . Don 't you know you 're all I 've got ? Don 't worry , Mom , I 'll protect you . See ? Yes , but I don 't want you playing with something so sharp . No , it 's a spear . Don 't you see ? Any lizard tries to hurt you , I 'll take care of him . That 's fine , honey . Just don 't hurt yourself , okay ? Okay , you sleep . I 'll stand guard till Dad gets back . It 's from Lt. James . He claims the battle for Los Angeles is well in hand . He expects to have the entire city under control by nightfall . I still don 't understand who gave the order . I did . Why wasn 't I told ? I didn 't have the time . You will , once I finish telling Charles . Don 't be so sure . Even Charles should be able to appreciate victory . Victory or insubordination ? You heard Lt. James ' report . The entire city will soon be ours . Including the Resistance ? I 've filed a complete progress report and sent a copy to the Leader . You do think of everything . And I hope , for your sake , all this celebration isn 't a bit premature . I don 't think so . That 's the difference between us , Lydia dear . I take charge of the situation ... and you wait for permission . We shall see . Now why don 't you take charge of the bridge ... while I go and talk to Charles . Charles , I 've just learned ... Diana has ordered the take-over of Los Angeles . How do you know ? I intercepted the message she sent to the Leader . You 're dismissed . The entire attack on the city is clearly ... a flagrant disregard of your command . Yes , unfortunately , her success makes her difficult to court-martial . - I don 't see why . - Simple politics . But I have a plan . And what is that ? I 'm going to marry Diana . You what ? As a member of the House of Raman ... I can take any woman I choose as my wife . By law , she cannot refuse . I know the law . Then you also know that once married ... the only way she can serve the cause is by bearing offspring . And that is a task better performed at home ... not the front line . It just seems like more politics to me . As they say here ... politics make strange bedfellows . Why don 't you just let me shoot her and be done with it ? Because then I 'd have to send you back . You 're sure it 'll work ? I 'll put her on the first available shuttle myself . - And what if she refuses ? - She can 't . By law , the ceremony must take place within 12 hours of betrothal . She 'll be married with lizard ... and on her way home before she knows what hit her . Is that why ... you 've installed the best bed in the fleet ? Lydia , surely you 're not jealous , are you ? Now consecrate . What did Kyle say ? Julie , we caught this guy outside . He claims to be a friend of yours . You did it . - Did I remember everything ? - Word for word . You even sounded like him . I think if I practice , I can remember everything I 'm told . Heads up . A Visitor patrol is coming down the street . Looks like they mean business . - Many ? - Full platoon , armed to the teeth . We should go , I can feel it . - We 'll be abandoning Julie if we do . - They 're getting closer , Mike . If we move now , we 'll draw their fire . We gotta ride out the storm . Yes , it is always best not to jump to contusions . Listen . It 's quiet . It 's too quiet . Move out . If we get separated , meet me at the lagoon in Griffith Park . Move ! Don 't let them escape ! No quarter ! Elizabeth ! Elizabeth , come on ! I came as soon as I got your message . I see that your furniture arrived . I take it that you heard about Lt. James ' success ... in locating the Resistance headquarters ? Unfortunately , the Resistance leaders have eluded him . But there 's a limit to how long they can stay at large ... with the entire city under our control . Was there something else ? Section 48 of the code . Section 48 deals with marriage . Don 't tell me you and Lydia ... Someone else . You . You must be joking . All is in preparation . No . I don 't have to . I am in the direct line of descent from Raman . The choice is mine , I choose you . I 'd rather die first . That can be arranged . I 'm sure you 'll change your mind . When you had me , was it like this ? I mean , did I hurt you this much ? Sweetie , you didn 't hurt me . This is just the way babies come in ... It 's just the way babies come into the world , honey . - How 's your mom ? - Good . Jo Ann , are you okay ? - She 's right in the middle of a contraction . - They 're happening every 20 minutes . I 'll stand guard . Come on , kid , give me a hand . It doesn 't mean she 'll deliver right now . - It could take as long as 48 hours . - Could happen any minute , right ? I don 't think so . But we brought a van . I 'd like to do a preliminary exam . If you 're up to it , I wanna take you with us . I don 't think she should move . What if we get stopped or pinned down ? We 're in the middle of fighting here . If something should happen ... at least back there , I 've got equipment to handle an emergency . It 's up to you . Do you think you can move ? What do you want to do ? All I want is to have my baby . You 're a doctor ? Listen to her . Who grows there ? Willie , it 's me . - Who 's me ? - Mike . Are you the only one here ? No , the others are over there . I 'm the outlook . - You mean the lookout . - Lookout . Good work . - Let 's go check in . - Yes , check in . You 're all right . I tried to shake the Visitors , I think I was successful . Where should we go now ? We 'll worry about that later . There 's something more important . - What ? - Julie and Kyle . If they bring that guy and his wife to what used to be headquarters ... - they 'll be walking straight into a trap . - How can we find them ? That 's the tough part . I can remember the general location ... but I can 't remember the exact address . Can you ? No . Elizabeth . I 'm not sure I can . What ? Anything might help . Elizabeth has a pornographic memory . Photographic . Sometimes , if I really concentrate ... - I can remember everything I 've heard . - Everything ? - She even does voices . - It doesn 't always work . What have we got to lose ? Remember this morning , Julie 's friend ... where did he say they were going ? " I need your help . My wife is having a baby . " With the Visitors attacking , all the hospitals are closed . " " Where is she ? " " At a bombed-out store on Fourth and Highland . " I left my son with her . " Fourth and Highland . That 's about 5 miles from here . - Are you okay ? - Just a little weak . It 's harder than I thought it would be . You did just fine . Give me a few minutes and I 'll be able to help you find Julie and Kyle . No , what I need you both to do ... is to set up a new base of operations for us . - Right here ? - No , Willie . There 's an abandoned movie studio . The Visitors hit it pretty hard . So they shouldn 't be back there for a while . How do we get there ? I marked a trail down the Cahuenga Pass . It leads right to the studio . You can 't miss it . Meanwhile , I 'll try to round up Julie and Kyle . If our luck holds out , we 'll meet you there . You 're in charge , Elizabeth . Yes ? What is it ? Charles asked me to shave your body in preparation . And he sent me to fit you for your wedding skin , Commander . I 'm afraid that won 't be necessary . There 's been a change of plans . There won 't be any wedding . Now get out of my sight . Don 't take it out on them , Diana . They 're merely following Charles ' orders . I suggest you do the same . When I want your suggestions , Lydia ... I 'll put a box outside the door . I 'm going to miss you , Diana . You 're really very complex . I can understand why Charles is so passionate ... about making you his bride . I hate to disappoint you , but there won 't be any wedding . I 'm sure the Leader ... will be less than pleased when he learns of Charles ' intentions . On the contrary , the Leader has already sent his blessing . Unfortunately , he won 't be able to attend the ceremony . You 'll look lovely in scales . What a strange place . All these buildings are just fronts . Perhaps the people that once lived here never looked behind them . Look ... This must have been quite a hot dog . Willie , wait ! Come here . Now there 's a real hot dog ! Isn 't he cute ? He likes you . - His name is Ramsey . - Ramsey ? I think we could use some help , Ramsey . - Your shuttle is ready , Commander . - Thank you , Louis . I appreciate your loyalty . I want you to have this . I know you deserve more ... but at the moment , it 's all I can offer you . Commander , please . It 's reward enough to serve you . Especially now that your enemies have you at a disadvantage . Now , please . You must go at once . Attention ! All docking personnel report to Loading Bay 17 . Incoming shuttle now , offloading . Medical personnel report to Mortuary in three minutes . Getting cold feet ? I was just checking out the landing bay . I see . Of course , you do know that if a bride is caught ... attempting to desert her groom ... such an offence is punishable by death . Why , Charles , I would never desert you . Good . I don 't handle rejection well . Take her away , Louis . So much for loyalty . How 's she doing ? She 's only 2 centimeters effaced ... and her contractions are about 10 minutes apart . We 've still got a little time to go yet . Honey , everything 's gonna be all right . You think we should try getting out of here ? Yes , I 'll get Kyle to move the van around so you don 't have far to walk . Get the van and back it up , it 's time to go . Bad timing . Visitor patrol just came around the corner . Great . What do you think ? Just let them pass . When they go by , we 'll leave . Sergeant , that van there . Check it out . I don 't want any vehicles in this sector ... that might be commandeered by the Resistance . Yes , sir . - Halt ! - Get back ! All right , hold your fire . I want these rebels taken alive for questioning . If we can make them talk , we 'll soon crush the entire movement . What happened ? Visitors saw the van and came in for a closer look . One spotted your son , and Kyle had to shoot him . - What are we gonna do ? - We fight with everything we go . On Earth they say it is unlucky to see the bride before the wedding . And yet somehow , I feel most fortunate . It 's nothing compared to what I will give you once we 're married . Of that I have no doubt . Where are those ceremonial eels ? Finally . What took you so long ? The ritual bath suits you well . Charles is a lucky man . You are by far the most beautiful woman ... in the fleet , Diana . I know . But it 's a curse sometimes . May their venom give you strength ... and their bodies make you fertile . Charles , I couldn 't wait for you in my quarters any longer . I 've been thinking about Diana . You 've decided on assassination . You know , you really must learn to control your passions . Untempered , they can be very dangerous . Then you 're still going to marry her . Of course . As long as you send her back . Actually , I 've decided to keep her for a while . - What ? - I may have a use for her . You went to her ritual bath . She 's more promising than I expected . You can 't do this . Don 't be silly . Of course I can , and I will . - Marta . - Lydia , you 're too early . Tell Charles that I 'm still preparing the marriage potion . It 's not good to rush these things ... Charles didn 't send me , and I couldn 't care less . - It must be difficult for you ... - Did you hear what I said ? Lydia , the entire fleet knows how you feel about Charles . There 's certainly no shame in losing to Diana . - But you must be very jealous . - Jealous ? Marta , do you enjoy working on the Mother Ship ? - The fleet is my life . - Then keep your opinions to yourself . Or Diana won 't be the only one being shipped back . I 'd like a bottle of cat poison . Isn 't it terrible how they multiply . Do you know that there won 't be a rat left to eat on this ship ... if something isn 't done about those awful cats soon . - What 's this ? - Essence of rodent musk . I don 't need perfume . Lydia , it is guaranteed to drive men crazy . You go too far . - Willie , what is it ? - More Visitors coming this way . Everybody scatter . I 'm sure I heard something in here . It 's only a dog . Let 's move on . Ramsey , come here , boy . - Come here . Good boy . - Ramsey , thank you . You 've got five minutes . Julie , isn 't there anything we can do ? I don 't want my girl born on a battlefield . Alan , I understand how you feel . But the only thing we can do now is to take it one step at a time . It 's okay , honey . Just take it easy now . I haven 't let you down yet , have I ? - I love you . - I love you , too . So you want a little girl this time , huh ? I want a baby . He wants a little girl . What are you going to name her ? - Jennifer . - Barbara . Maybe you 'll have twins . You men over there , cover the side street . I 'm sorry . - About what ? - The trouble I 've caused . Forget it . - You killed him ? - I don 't know . I don 't think so . He managed to crawl away . And you didn 't shoot him again ? - Nope . - I would have . When I grow up , I 'll join the Resistance and kill lizards just like that . With any luck , maybe you won 't have to . But I want to . Wrong . You shouldn 't want to kill anybody . Not even lizards . - I thought you were with the Resistance . - That 's right . Then I don 't understand . How can you be with the Resistance and not want to kill lizards ? - What 's your name ? - John Michael Davis . Now listen to me , John Michael Davis . There 's only one reason to ever pick up a gun , and that 's in self-defense . Everybody 's got a right to live . Even the Visitors ... as long as they are willing to live by the same rules that we are . Understand that ? Why don 't you go back with your dad before things heat up around here again . This is your last chance . Surrender or die . You have one minute . What are the options ? It sounds like they 're going to try and rush us . We can either stay and fight , or try to get her into the van . - Either way , it 's gonna be pretty tough . - I want this baby born free . Let 's go for it . John , come on around and help me with your mom . Remember your deep breathing . - Don 't get messed up . It 's now or never . - Get ready , men . I want you to get in the van and start it . I 'll cover you . We 'll get out of here . Is there anything I can do ? Think you still got a pitching arm ? When I make a break for the van , lob this into that jeep there . Got it . Forty-five seconds . Here goes nothing . This is your last chance . All right , hold it . Drop your weapon . Continue to walk with your hands in the air . Hey , boys , the party 's up here ! It 's their leader , go ! - You saved her , Dad . You did it . - You betcha . Now let 's go . - Go on through on the top there . - Yes , sir . - I thought it might be you . - How 'd you know ? Isaac Newton . What goes up , must come down . The wedding march . It 's time , my friends . Are you ready ? Charles , do you promise to be the stone ... that crushes the leader 's enemies ? Diana , do you promise to bear Charles ... in the rightness of your years ... a multitude of fearless warriors ? - Will you hunt and provide ? - I will . The ceremonial mouse . Like two serpents intertwine ... may you cling together until death . You may kiss the bride . It 's all right . She always cries at weddings . Then , in the name of our glorious leader ... I declare you mated . On behalf of myself and my lovely bride , enjoy yourselves . - How thoughtful of you to come . - Yes , we missed you . What 's that scent you 're wearing ? Musk of Rat . Do you like it ? - It fits you to a tee . - Enchanting . Don 't let me keep you . Jealousy leaves such a disagreeable after-taste . Shall we go ? Here we are . It reminds me of Lydia , even the smell . Musk of Rat : Lydia 's new perfume . Yes , it does seem to linger once you 've had a whiff of it . You had them engraved . How thoughtful . - Charles and Diana . - A gift from Lydia , actually . The time has come . In my heart , I have longed for this moment . Then drink with me . Take this as you take me forever . I 've just been poisoned . Alan , she 's so lovely . You finally got the daughter you wanted . We owe her life to all of you . You 'll never know how grateful we are for all you 've done . We wouldn 't have had it any other way . Look , Jo Ann and I have talked it over with John . We 're gonna name her Victoria after the victory we 'll all enjoy someday . I like that . Let it be soon . For all our sakes . It 's too late for regrets , Lydia . You 're under arrest for the wanton murder of Charles . - Take her away . - No ! English

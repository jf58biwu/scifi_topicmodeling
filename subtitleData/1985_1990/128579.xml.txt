" Will you please help me welcome our mystery contestant - Miss Amber Mendez ! Let me go ! Amber , now , I understand that you 're single , Amber , and that you live on the west side . Not surprisingly , she 's flaunted the law and traditional morality all of her life . Go ahead . Tell some lies about me now . We don 't lie . Phil , tell us all about her . Weiss , what is it ? The camera relay . It 's not pointing up . Who gives a damn ? Hey , where are you going ? Later , she cheated on college exams , had sexual relationships with two , sometimes three different men in a year , and then she met " mad dog " Ben Richards , her confederate , her lover . That was a lie ! Dear , dear , dear . Let 's reunite these little lovebirds . Go ! Aah ! It 's got to be here . What is going on ? The relays are the same . They point into the middle of the game zone . The uplink to the network satellite is in there . No wonder Mic 's people couldn 't find it . If we find that uplink , we can crack the code . Jam the network . Forget this crazy business ! We got to move on . Let 's go ! Move , move ! Christ ! Aah ! Aah ! Stalkers , we 've got a bead - 20 degrees north , mark 7 , 12 degrees east , mark 2 .

Shh . Someone 's coming . Richards , wait ! It 's Amber ! What the hell are you doing here ? You think I 'm glad to be here ? Who the hell is this ? She turned me in at the airport . This is her reward . Well , go ahead . Make jokes . It 's your fault I 'm here . They even think I 'm your girlfriend . See this camera up there ? I can strangle you for the home audience . Another relay . Quick ! Weiss ! What 's he talking about ? Let 's go . Weiss , over here ! Richards ! Look out ! You son of a bitch ! Richards , help ! Wait ! Laughlin , move it ! Yeah . Let 's go . Give me your money . OK . OK . Hey , man , what are you doing ? Hey ! The resistance wants to jam the network . Here 's our chance . Let 's go ! No . This is more important .

Follow me , light bulb ! Ah , got you ! Come on ! All right ! Oh , God . I 'm stuck ! Somebody help me ! God , cut ! Go to commercials . Jesus Christ ! I have no power . Go to commercial ! Kill him ! No . I won 't kill a helpless human being , Not even sadistic scum like you . Oh , my God ! Boo ! Boo ! Come on ! Do it ! What happened to Buzzsaw ? He had to split . Boo ! Hey , what an incredible battle ! Buzzsaw gone , Dynamo down , but the stalk isn 't over 'til the fat lady sings , and the very last criminal ... Fireball , report to wardrobe at once . Fireball , you 're wanted in wardrobe . And our halftime show ! Laughlin , break 's over . Come on . Let 's get going . I 'm going somewhere , but not with you . Buzzsaw took care of my ... Traveling arrangements . Oh , my God . Weiss ? He is dead . Ohh ... But he gave me the code , the satellite uplink code . The underground has a broadcast center in quadrant four . Take her . Take her and the code to Mic . Don 't let us die for nothing . Listen , we 're counting on you . Don 't let us down . I don 't want to be the only asshole in heaven Ben . He saved my life . It should be me down there . We got them ? Hey , Ben ? I got to hand it to you , pal . You got the whole network in an uproar . They 're shipping bicarb to the Justice Department in crates . This call is between us . It 's not on the air . Listen carefully , Ben . How would you like a three-year contract , guaranteed , a cadre credit line , and a beach-front condo ? Sound impossible ? Ben , that 's the standard deal for a network stalker . I know real talent . I 'd hate to see you get canceled tonight when you could go the distance . Say the word , Ben . You could be doing the stalking . What do you think ? You cold-blooded bastard . I 'll live to see you eat that contract . Leave room for my fist because I 'll ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine ! Damon , it 's for you . W-who ? It 's the attorney general . Get out . Everybody , out . Come on . Move . Yes . Fireball ! Fireball ! Fireball ! Fireball ! Come on , Fireball . Yay ! Let 's go ! He 's my hero ! He 's my hero ! Fireball ! There he goes . Fireball 's on his way . Dynamo 's down , but not out . Back to you , Damon . All right , Agnes . Big chance . Win lots of prizes . We 've still got two crack stalkers - Dynamo and Fireball . Who will make the next kill ? Oh , boy . That 's a tough one . Give it a try . who do you think ? OK . I think the next kill will be made by ... Ben Richards . Hold it . Hold it . Agnes , Richards is a runner . You 've got to pick a stalker . I can pick anyone I choose , and I choose ... Ben Richards . Richards ? He 's one mean motherfucker . $ 200 on Richards ! Come on ! 200 on Richards ! $ 200 on Richards ! Come on - Just do it ? Just do it . OK . OK . You want it . You got it . Place your bet . Place your bet . Secret broadcast center doesn 't exist . There 's nothing out here . We should have taken that trip to Hawaii . I had the shirt , but you fucked it up . Jesus Christ ! Guess again . Come on , keep up . I 'm running too fast . My feet can 't keep up ! There he goes , the number-one rusher . he smells blood , and nothing on earth can stop him . Wait . I don 't Want to go . Richards ! Here . This way . Why ? I want to go that way . Let go of me . Put me down . You 're going to get us killed . Aah ! Stop it ! Richards ! Let me Go ! Amber , get out of here . Go ! Now ! Richards ! Amber ! Richards ! Richards ! Richards . Aah ! Whitman . and Price . Haddad . They 're Running Men . Last season 's winners . No . Last season 's losers . Huh ? Aah ! Why can 't I fly ? Why can 't I fly ? How about a light ? Aah ! What a hothead . Yeah , Richards ! Captain Freedom to wardrobe on the double . Forget it , Killian . I won 't do it . It 's no request , It 's an order . I don 't need this crap . This stuff is ... garbage ! I - I used to kill guys like this with my hands . I 'm not using any tricks . This is a sport of death and honor . Code of the gladiators ! Spare me the combat zen speech . What 's the matter with you ? Can 't you see what 's going on ? This isn 't a game ! They 're betting on Richards up there ! Bullshit ! Get out of here . Get him out of here ! What 's the matter ? Steroids make you deaf ? Get him out of here now ! Now what ? Let 's find Mic 's secret broadcast center , if it even exists . Oh , shit ! Let 's try that way . We 're trapped . Subzero , Fireball , and Buzzsaw . Say their names with reverent pride . They punished crime and served the law . As patriots , they died . I hate third-act problems . Roll ... stock . Freeze in digital memory . and ... activate traveling matte . Tony , this better work , or you 'll be a digital memory . Take it easy , Damon . We 're loading Richards ' image onto the data base . When he 's mapped onto the stunt double , you 'll never know the difference . All right , boys . Let 's see you dance . Sensational . I love it ! Mr. Richards , you 're so easily caught . Welcome to the people 's network . We 've been waiting for you . This is nice , Mic , but you could 've gotten off your asses and helped us . We 'd have been seen . The government would have found us . Laughlin , Weiss would have died for nothing . They didn 't . I have the uplink code . Ladies and gentlemen , I 've got an update on tonight 's incredible action . The runners have entered the final quad . Captain Freedom has hung up his announcer 's mike and come out of retirement . He 's ready for the final conflict . Let 's go now , live , to the game zone ! Aah ! Uh ! Aah ! Ha ha ha ! Yes , it 's all over ! What a colossal fight ! This is an incredible moment in sports . Captain Freedom , out of retirement and undefeated - proving that right and might are one and the same ! Damn that Killian ! You should be happy . We 're officially dead . We can do anything . Don 't you understand ? They 'll never let us out alive . They can 't afford it . They 'll hunt us down . Off camera , of course . OK . Dismantle all the overlays . Put the digital matte in the pixel memory storage . The damn thing worked like a charm . It should . Editel charged us an arm and a leg for the software . Damon ! You didn 't have to kill him ! It 's part of life , Brenda . You better fuckin get used to it . That 's one for the award show . Thank you . You 're doing nice work . Tony , you 're finally getting it . You don 't need guns to jam a satellite . I do , to keep it . The network will try to shunt the next signal in orbit . Stevie 's group will stop them . These kids ? This is a bad move , Mic . They need a leader , Someone with experience . I thought you were looking for the door . I told Killian I 'd be back . I wouldn 't want to be a liar . listen up , everybody .

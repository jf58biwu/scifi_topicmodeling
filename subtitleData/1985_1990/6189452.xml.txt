I remember when you laughed , Epicycle . ... and night fell over the planet Gyllenblå , silence descended , and the black darkness of night enveloped Raschs presidential palace . but the president himself had trouble sleeping that night . - Something worrying you , Your President . - Someone wants to hurt me . - You who are so good . Who can it be ? - Someone out there in the darkness . - Someone laughs ! - Rumours ! You forbade the laughter ... An ingenious idea ! The people became obedient . What is the danger with laughter ? The laughter comes from someone who is not afraid . Good night , Vega . Good night , Kefal . Good night , Atom . - What is she doing ? - Kissing them . Because she 's the principal . The principal likes her students . It 's not very sensible of you to whisper ! Good night , Morgana . Good night , Cecilie . Good night ... Frederick . - What are you looking at ? - At that star . What if it 's the sun ! Our own sun ... Engineering drawing exercise KR 811 . Show the function of this spacecraft , through the combination of programs 64 and alpha gamma epsilon 9 . 29 Alef you shouldn 't exaggerate the impulse breach in coil B. Much better ! Talented child ! - What have you done ? - That spaceship , but different . - How nice ! - Yes , it 's really n ... ugly . Use the computer graphics ! Freehand drawing can not depict technical features . - I prefer to use my imagination . - Imaginative drawing is unreasonable ... But it 's fun ! 23 Fredrik will draw according to the prescribed reason plan , serving the people 's interests . At home you could draw what you wanted . Don 't argue ! Delete it ! Here you are . Go ahead . It 's apparently a kind of clothing ... It reminds me of something ... Through careful exercise one can defeat gravity . Arms out ! Arms here ! Begin ! One , two ... Faster ! Stop ! 23 Fredrik , don 't fly against the rules ! - Cecilie and Galaxia , I 'm flying ! - All pupils , close your eyes ! Listen , you ... It may have come out old rubbish with clowns like you stared at before and laughed at . Video cabinets were destroyed after rationalization . Amendment ! One copy is kept at the health institution for experiments . The infection may have started in the reason school . - Now I remember ... - What do you remember ? In this video cabinet , there were men and I ... The video cabinet which was banned ! And we laughed ... We laughed until we cried . - Strange ... - Listen ! If we put on these clothes ... If anyone sees us , they might start laughing ! In a few days it 's the anniversary day . - Yes , then the president makes a speech ... - Exactly ! What if ... - Can you do what you want in your free time ? - Yes , that is why it 's free time . - You can look at the sensible pictures . - Interesting ... What are you doing yourself ? Dancing . You train hard to become number one and an example for your teammates . - Galaxia , dance for us ! - Yes , do it , Galaxia ! - What do you do in your spare time ? - This and that . I ride my bike sometimes . - And he pinches cherries . - And I think about things . And I can ride . Yes , like this ! Wait ! I 've thought of one thing we tend to do in our spare time . You take one of these , sort of . Come on , sit in a circle . Whoever it stops on has to kiss Frederick . Galaxia . - Whoever plays has to join in ... - I 'm going . Do you think Frederick is disgusting ? No , I don 't think so , but he 's unreasonable . - You have to kiss to get children . - What ? ! You start that way anyway . - Is that true ? I don 't believe it . - How do you get kids with you , then ? Come . - You seem to be in a good mood today . - Yes , I got the speech for the anniversary . I 'll remind Gyllenblå how peaceful and safe , everything is , when laughter and worries are gone . - And the nasty rumors ? - No new reports ! Maybe spatial noise in there ... Well I 'm happy for you . We can feel optimistic about the future . There 's one thing I 'm thinking of ... What would you say about having a test tube together with me ? - I don 't believe it ... - Go then ! I can kiss him , if it 's so necessary . It means nothing to me . Well ? Kiss , Fredrik ! You 're crazy ! Quiet ! Look ! Hello , Central ! We have a very strong indication ... close . No , not likely . It is secure ! - Help me ! - Head over to the bathroom and wipe the tears ! - Is Galaxia there ? - 24 Cecilie . 17 Galaxia is in the bathroom . - What 's wrong with 23 Fredrik ? - He ... he has the hiccups ! Listen ! All children in the reason school , without exception , to be locked up at the health institution and get triple doses of ... One moment ! Amendment ! We 'll put police forces on alert near the school , but without them being visible . Over and out ! - Oh , oh , oh ! - Oh dear ! How will this go ? - Police Chief Lagerström here . - Jorgensen . - What 's going on here , then ? - It 's good that you came . The Cabinet must be opened . I 'm sure the poor children are in great danger . - Are the children be in the cabinet ? - That 's not easy to answer . Krull is also in there . - What 's that ? - It 's just a video clip ... - We believe that there 's a connection . - Yes , but it sounds strange . Yes , as I said ... Citizens of Gyllenblå ! It 's our anniversary today . We had hoped to celebrate the peace and order , but a ruthless enemy is destroying everything that we 've built up . Stop ! Here it is . I 'm absolutely sure . Rasch : With determination . I will hunt down and track every conceivable laugher . Each Gyllenblå man should keep his ears open . Report to the nearest police station if you hear the slightest giggle ! It 's dangerous . A smile can contain dynamite ! No one is free from suspicion . None at all ! Except myself . Your mother , your father , your aunt , your children ... Someone laughed . - There he is , 23 Fredrik ! - But ... - Grab him ! - But what did I do ? Cecilie , why ? Thank you . You saved us . 24 Cecilie . I only did my duty . Subtitles by Squashy Hat ( 2015 )

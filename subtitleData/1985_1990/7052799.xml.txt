 Must be a tumor . You think it could be a teratoma ? I dunno , I don 't think so . Never seen anything like this . Look , just bring the subject in , and we 'll cut it open . See what 's growing inside of it . God , go get it ! Get - Paul , go get the cat ! Get him ! Code red ! Code red ! SD618 has escaped ! Use extreme caution ! Radiation security , radiation security ! Ah ! Aaahhh ! Aaahhhhhh ! Radio : ... hallway 10-70R ! Security assistance ! Radio : Security assistance , please , to hallway 10-70R ! The building 's secure . Now Paul , no matter what happens , we can 't let that cat out of here . Dr. Grey , you saw what just happened at that stairwell . Just shut up about that . Right now we 've got to kill that cat . Gimme your gun . Give me your gun ! Nice kitty ... Here kitty , kitty ... Nice kitty ... Ah ! Agghhh ! Noooooo ! Ugh ... No . Don 't even think about it , we cannot afford this hotel . Yes we can . Just think " yes , we can . " We 've done it before , right ? Ooh ! Sorry ' bout that ! Whoah , yeah ! There we go ! Hey , it 's cool , it 's cool . Yeah , take it easy . Look , honey , we 've tried every other place in town . Okay , let 's just go inside , and sit down in the lobby for five minutes . Whaddya say ? I mean my feet are killing me . Why did you let me wear these shoes this morning ? You wanted to wear those shoes ! You think they make your legs look good , you tell me that ! And they do , see ? Whoo-hoo ! Alright , let 's go . Do you have any reservations here ? Well not exactly - I thought so . But my uncle is a stockholder - I 'm sorry , but you cannot stay in this lobby without reservations . I was just wondering if perhaps , five minutes maybe - No , I 'm sorry , you 'll have to find somewhere else to go . Now please , get out . Get out ! Wester ! It 's okay , they 're with me . Oh , I 'm so sorry ... I am really sorry , Mr. Graham , there must 've been some misunderstanding . You see , I thought they were all part of the college stock . That 's okay . Sorry about that . Hotel personnel get a little sensitive during spring break week . Yeah . Girls don 't have a room , do you ? Yeah . No . Um ... Hahahaha . It 's okay . I understand . I 've been there . I might be able to help you with a place to stay . I was just about to go and have some dinner , why don 't you join me , we can talk about it ? I don 't think that would - Well , it 's just something to eat , Suzanne . Ah ! It 's a good restaurant , just something to eat , Suzanne . No strings attached . I just don 't think we 're dressed for dinner . It 'll be alright , trust me . And I 'm starving ! You can leave your bags here . Come on . Wait for us . So ? That 's what he said . Jesus , do you believe this guy ? We 've gotta go , now . Ladies , business associate , Mike Harvey . Mmm . How do you do ? We 've got a meeting , remember ? Bobbie , Suzanne , please accept my apologies . My associate is correct . I do have some business to take care of . But you haven 't had your dessert yet . All the more for you . You are coming to party , right ? Starts about midnight on my yacht ? Uh , yeah . I 'll send the limo back here to get you . Should be fun . Lots of interesting people . Bob , see that ladies get what they want . See you in a little while . Goodbye , Mr. Graham . Oh please , call me Walter . Goodnight , Walter . Y 'know , you really got no class at all , y 'know that ? You couldn 't give me ten minutes more ? You wanna miss this appointment for a couple of bimbos ? He 'll wait ! You can 't be certain , Walt . He 's scared , and he 's desperate . Desperate men do desperate things . Alright . That ought 'a lop ' er . I 'm telling you , I just don 't know . Now , Daryl , it 's gonna be alright . Trust me . We 've all made a lot of money from our little understanding . And it 's coming unglued . Look what the commission 's doing already . You sure it won 't be too hot in here , Mr. Graham ? Uh , probably . Turn on the air conditioning . I love to look at a fire , don 't you ? Well , sure . It 's nice . Here , drink this , Perkins , and stop being such a pussy . You 've got no right to talk to me like that . Now Daryl , Mr. Harvey didn 't mean anything . Yeah , I 'm sorry . You guys don 't know what it 's like to fight the SEC . You 've got the big bucks to pay the fines and get off . I don 't . I 'm just small potatoes , I 'll go to jail . Y 'know , they 're really cracking down , I mean look at Bowski , Ravine , and all the rest ? I don 't have the money to just - Alright . Just take a look right in there , Daryl . There 's no problem with money . Hahaha . Anything you need . One million dollars in cold hard cash . Another one in that ... And another one in that . No , no . My family , my wife would - I think we 're getting way ahead of ourselves , here . Have you been contacted yet by the boys from the SEC ? Not yet . There 've been inquiries at the firm , lot of talk . We just got too greedy . Are you sure you haven 't talked to anybody yet ? No I haven 't . Of course I won 't . You guys know that , I mean , c 'mon , you 've got nothing to fear . I would stand to lose as much as you guys , even more . Walter ? You can trust me . I know I can , relax , Daryl . It 's alright . C 'mon , come with me , lemme show you around the yacht . Albert ? Yes , sir ? Turn on the spotlight and make it all bubbly , yeah ? We love that . Now bear with me on this , Daryl . I started this little story because you were saying that I could trust you , that I had nothing to fear . That 's right , Walter . You 've got nothing to fear from me . You either , Mike , you can trust me , I swear . It 's called blackmail . You 've heard the term ? Of course . Mike , you 're ahead of my story . Anyway , you see the point is that I learned about blackmail a long time ago . What I learned was ... Never put yourself in a position where some idiot can blackmail you . Where someone has power over you . Like being able to make a deal with the SEC . Tell them something they want to know . Turn state 's evidence for a lighter sentence ? Hmm ? Walter , I wouldn 't do that . I wouldn 't do that . Please , Walter . C 'mon . Mike ? Mike , c 'mon , what are you doing - Please Walter . There 's only one way to be certain . But , I 'll do whatever you want . I 'll do whatever you want ! Mike , look at Albert . Look at him . I think he 's gonna be sick . You okay , Albert ? Just outta breath . Oh , and Albert , the party is in about an hour and a half . So after you 've cleaned up this mess here , get everything ready . Will you please ? Come here , kitty . That 's a girl . Drink some milk , that 's a good cat . There you go . Good kitty . Yeah ... That feels better . Good kitty . You got some change for the cigarette machine ? Yeah . Ugh ! Hey ! Ah ! Ah ! Alright , gimme the keys . How much you get ? Enough . Hahaha . Hahaha ! Ahhh ! Agghhh ! What 's hap - Aggghhhh ! Ahhh ! Agghhhhh ! Ooohhhh ! Ugghhhh ! Fort Lauderdale at spring break . No place like it in the world , agreed ? No contest . Ha ! Woo ! Alright , let 's go down to the beach , check out the action . My friend , the beach is for riff-raff . Look , you want to find a classy chick , you go to a marina . Where all the money is . C 'mon , everybody knows that . Oh yeah , of course . Hey you 're right again Corey , check these two out . Help me , I 'm in love ! And they seem to be coming our way . Oh man , what 're we gonna do ? Try to look bored . Do what I do . Hi . Mind if we sit down ? Of course . Be our guests . We just wanted to sit for some coffee , you sure you don 't mind ? Hey , you guys . Oh no . Hello , ladies . Hi . We 're never going to find a place to stay . This whole town 's booked . Not now , Hedgeworth , we 're busy . Last night we met this guy Walter Graham . He 's got this great big yacht - Wait a minute , are you talking - about Wall Street Walter ? I mean this guy is the best arbitrageur in the world . He 's made more millions on Wall St. than anybody . Must be the same guy . You should see this boat . But anyways - we 're supposed to set sail this morning on a cruise to the Caribbean . Be gone a couple days , maybe more . Why don 't you guys come with us ? You can help us handle thus guy if he gets out of hand . Besides , it 'll be fun . I hear the Caribbean 's perfect this time of year for swimming in the raw . I am really gonna meet Walter Graham ? Alright , thank you . Dammit , the girls aren 't on board . Good , let 's get the hell out of here before they come back . You just don 't get it , do you ? Don 't you think two pretty girls on a cruise makes a good cover ? In case somebody should be snooping around ? You gotta use your brain , Mike . I mean , we need those - I know what you want ' em for , and it has nothing to do with cover . We need the girls on board . You know , broads are a pain in the ass . All broads are a pain in the ass . Hahaha . I can 't believe you don 't know who Walter Graham is ? Sure , I 've heard of him . So he 's made a lot of money , so what ? So what ? ! This guy has been the cover of Forbes magazine twice . He 's just a man . Horny like every other guy . Yeah well , he ain 't the only horny one , you sweet thing . Ssh ! You guys hear that ? Ah ! Oh , look , the poor thing ! Kitty ! Aw , it looks starved ! Oh come here ! Oh . Genetic Labratory . This must be a lab animal , must 've gotten away . You mean they 're gonna cut it up and experiment on it ? No , not necessarily . But sometimes it is vital to do experiments - No way ! Not with this cat . I 'm taking my little baby with me . I dunno guys , I feel a little sick . I never realized I 'd actually get seasick . C 'mon Luke , look at the size of that boat out there . You are not gonna get sick on a luxury yacht like that , c 'mon . Come on . Come to momma . We 'll make you feel real good . There you go . You okay ? Oh my ... So , how is my captain this morning ? I 'd be a lot better if we hadn 't lost an entire crew . You mean you still haven 't replaced them ? Walter , do you know what time it is ? Besides , if you didn 't treat them like slaves we wouldn 't have to replace them . Okay . So I got a little drunk and mouthed off to the crew . I apologize . But it is my boat ! So it is . And if you don 't like that , honey , you 're free to leave anytime . And let you ruin her before I have a chance to get her back ? Hahaha . Your old man couldn 't make a go of this boat , what makes you think you can ? Leave my father out of this . Rachel ... If you really want the damn boat back , all you have to do is ask . I can be a very generous man with people who just treat me right . Walter , you pay me to run this boat , nothing else . ( Sigh . ) Well , think about it . Okay ? Just think about it . Don 't count on it . What 's going on here , Mike ? Mr. Graham , I was just telling your associate here that I 'm a great admirer of yours . You are the greatest . Hahahaha . Well thank you , but I 'm sorry , you 're gonna have to leave anyway . And how appropriate , here comes the shuttle right now . Mr. Graham ? Mr. Graham ? Mr. Graham ... Albert ? Mr. Graham , the SEC ... I just got word the SEC is getting a warrant to search your boat . We 've gotta get out here now . Uh , I 'm afraid we 've had a change in plans , and we 're gonna be leaving immediately . So I 'm sorry , but you 're all gonna have to go back to the pier on that shuttle boat . Captain ! Take us out to sea right now , please . Without a crew ? You must be joking . You guys still wanna go on this cruise or not ? I 'd do anything , I just don 't want to barf again . Look , Walter . You 've got three able-bodied men here , plus Suzanne and I can help . That 's crewmen that you don 't even have to pay . Besides , we 'll all have some fun , whaddaya say ? Albert , take these three sailors and raise the anchor , and then bring up the gangplank . Mike , start the engines . Alright , everybody ! Come on , let 's move it ! Suzanne , that cat goes back with the shuttle . No , it 's mine ! You know , I heard a cat onboard a ship is supposed to be good luck , Mr. Graham . Listen kid , you really wanna go on this little cruise with the rest of us , first thing you gotta learn is that this is my yacht . That means I am in charge . And I don 't like cats . So the cat goes , sorry Suzanne . Oh please Walter , I promise this darling little kitty won 't be any trouble . Please ? I 'll take care of it . You won 't be sorry . I promise . Okay , keep the damn thing , but you owe me one , Suzanne . And I never forget that ! Haha ! Check this place out . Whoah ! It must 've been some party , huh ? It was . How you feeling now , better ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Corey was right , being on a boat this big ... I 'm okay . I told you nobody gets sick on yachts . Oh gross , what a mess . Yeah , the hell with mess . You know somebody could live on this boat , permanent-like ? Well , Mr. Graham loves to party . Well then he can 't be all that bad . Haha ! Here pussy , have some food . Aw , hey ! Where you going , sexy ? That cat 's not going anywhere . Lets you and me have some fun , huh ? What do you say ... we partake of a little party ? Yeah ! let 's party ! ... and back , and ... Hahaha ! Damn , I certainly feel sorry for the sucker who has to clean this place up . So pity is not a good habit to get into , kid . We had a deal about a crew on this boat , remember ? Sure thing , Mr. Graham . We were just a little hungry . I don 't like you . I don 't like punk kids that think the world owes them a living . What that means is despite what duties that the captain has for you , I 'm assigning some specific duties right now . You 're the cook . You 're the busboy and the dishwasher . You 're the maid . Yeah , well you can go take a flying - Whoah ! Just a minute there , now he 's right , Mr. Graham is the boss . Who 's side are you on ? Well , nobody 's side . We have work to do , and we 're gonna do it , right ? As a matter of fact , we 'll throw a party tonight , in your honor . And Walter , you leave all the petty stuff to me , you 've got much more important matters to attend to . Hey guys , we can get this place cleaned up in no time , huh ? You must be the smart one . Smart ones always know who 's running the show . I hate punks like those guys . Mike , the only important thing here is that we get this boat to Grand Cayman and get our money out of that bank before it really hits the fan . It 's time we throw in our cards , take our winnings , and get the hell out of town . Now if these punks can help us run this boat , then we need them . Alright , just keep them the hell away from me . Alright . You put all the cash in the safe ? Yeah . You gotta loosen up , man , you realize how much money we 're gonna be taking out of the bank ? You 're gonna be richer than your wildest dreams ! Suppose the account is frozen when we get there ? Stop worrying ! Today 's only Friday . We 're there first thing Monday morning , we get the cash , then we go buy a country in South America . Laugh a little ! Live a little ! You 're a rich man ! Oh , Mike , uh . They 're all talking about a storm . Whaddaya want me to do , Rachel ? What am I supposed to do here ? Just keep that needle heading like I showed you . Well you gotta get one of those kids up here . I don 't know how to - Albert ! You 're taking us off course . Well I , uh ... Just keep the needle pointed like I showed you . You understand ? And keep your hands off everything but the wheel , alright ? Go ahead . Take the wheel . Relax . It 'll be fine . Great spring break in Lauderdale , huh Corey ? Yeah , you just wait til I get the chance to talk to Walter Graham . Oh , and in the meantime , we do dishes . We came to party . C 'mon , Lance , for once I agree with Corey . Make the best of it , this isn 't so bad . We 're working on a fantastic yacht . We 're sailing the Caribbean , this is how real adventure begins ! I feel like Errol Flynn . Hedgeworth , you 're weird . I hope one of you boys can cook , because we can 't . Not to worry . I can cook . Oh great , first we gotta do dishes , now we gotta eat Hedgeworth 's cooking ? Well I sure do feel sorry for you boys . Having to work so hard in this very hot kitchen . I dunno how you can stand it . It 's really hot . Ahh ! It is so hot in here ! Say Lance , gettin ' a little warm in here ? Yeah . You see boys , getting mixed up with us wasn 't such a bad idea after all . All your hard work will have its rewards , I promise . It is so hot ! Maybe I don 't feel so much like Errol Flynn . Maybe more like Woody Allen . I 'll see you guys later . Boy I gotta tell ya , I will even make out with the captain , that 's what he said . Yeah , the captain . Then he leaves me . All alone here while he goes out and has his fun . Boy , I 've ... Haha ! C 'mon here , baby ! Amen ! Ah ! Albert ! ... so then he turns to me and he says , " I 'll give ya 15 million dollars to just walk out of this room and forget we ever existed . " Haha ! I look him straight in the eyes and I said , " No . " Hahaha ! That is a great story . And I call , and some hot - How much did you end up with ? Eh , you tell me , Mike . Hahaha ! We walked , but not before we got 25 million . You 're different than your two friends . I guess I am . They 're okay . Corey 's pre-law , Lance is a jock , he 's got a free ride . Wrestling . He 's pretty good . What about yourself ? Me ? I 'm ... a biologist . I 'm uh , a year away from my doctorate . Now don 't you run away from momma anymore . ... so hot . Now Suzanne , you remember our deal ? Keep that cat away from me , or I 'll give it a swimming lesson . Oh , it 's just a sweet little thing . You 're not gonna hurt anybody , are you baby ? See , I 'm such a pushover . Why do you prefer the company of this kid to me ? Hmm ? Why ? He has brains . Brains ? What would you know about brains , you are such a dumb broad ! Hey ! Wait a second , there 's no reason to talk to her like that . It 's okay , Martin . He 's just a little drunk , he 's making a joke . Mr. Graham and I are old friends . That 's right , we are old , old friends . If you two will excuse me , I guess I shouldn 't leave Albert at the wheel . Well that 's right , you go ahead , ' cause you 're sure not doing this party any good . Whoo ! Crank it . Alright ! Babe , shall we tango ? Tammy Faye , baby , this is for you . Mine eyes have seen the glory - of the coming of the Lord , He is trampling ... trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored - He has lightning and - Albert ! Captain Albert , at your service , baby . You are drunk . You are right . Haha . Oh Jesus , you 've taken us way off course . Never fear , my dear . Captain Albert will fix it ! Go sober up ! Go on , get out of here . I 'm gonna have to figure out where the hell we are . Go on ! Get outta here ! Aye aye , baby ! [ Albert mumbling ] Get my wine outta here ... Aahh ! Ah , ah ! Oh God . Hahaha ! Get away , that 's my wine . Get away from that wine ! Get away , baby ! Shoo ! Shoo ! Come on ! Just a ... Nice little kitty ... Ah ! That 's good , heheheh . You want some of this , sweet little pussy ? Aaaahhhh ! Aagghhh ! Yoohoo , time to get lost , kiddo , y 'know ? She 's all yours . Come with me . Walt . That stupid Albert must 've hit his head and gone over . Just my luck . Now that Little Miss Captain is gonna want to go back and look for him . Look , I say we just get out of here and we didn 't see anything , okay ? Yeah . Okay . Of course . Nothing 's gonna keep me from getting to the Caymans . Us ! We 're on the same boat together , remember ? So what do you think ? You like Lance ! Yeah , he 's a real stud . What about Corey ? He 's a little preoccupied with money . Don 't you think ? Yeah . Tell me seriously , you wouldn 't mind living like this all the time ? Mmmhmm . Could get used to it . That 's what I thought . What happened ? I dunno exactly , she 's running way too hot , I had to shut her down . For how long ? If I had a halfway decent crew , I wouldn 't have to stop her in the first place . I can 't even find that nitwit Albert . I can 't find him . This is what I was afraid of , there was an accident . He must 've fallen overboard . Oh my God . I had a feeling this was going to be a bad time . You ain 't handling this right , she ain 't gonna buy it . Our little lady captain is gonna jump at it . Looks like Albert fell overboard last night . What ? ! Are you sure ? We 've looked everywhere . That 's just awful . Well I have to notify the authorities and then we have to go back and look for him . Backtrack ? You gotta be kidding , we can 't be going back . Well I 'm afraid that can 't be helped , considering the circumstances . I hadn 't planned on telling you this until we arrived at port , you see if we make my deadline , let 's just say I 'll be a very rich man , among other things - I won 't be needing this boat anymore . Transfer of ownership papers ? In your name . All legit . And at a price you can manage . That is , if you think you get your charter business going again . I 'm not trading a man 's life for a boat . Well that 's very commendable . No matter what you may think of me , I wouldn 't either . Mike , tell her . It doesn 't make sense . We can 't be spending all those days with the authorities ; wasting that time , wasting their money , risking their lives for a body they ain 't going to find . We can 't be certain of that . Yes I can . Albert couldn 't swim . Is that true ? I 'm afraid so . It 's a shame about Albert . I liked him . Yeah . Well , he 's shark bait now . Alright , make up your mind , Rach . Do you want the yacht or not ? I 'll have to make a record in my log . Well of course . I would expect no less . Mmm . That 's right . Hahahaha ! ... decided to continue passage to the Cayman Islands . ... captain 's decision based on ... Do you have a sextant ? Yes . Why ? Can I take a look at it ? Okay , but a chart and a sextant 's used for navigation . I know , I just wanna try it out for something else here . Does this look like it could be Albert 's ? Could be , why ? Do you have any water ? Any liquid at all ? Hold that there . Thanks . Like that ? Yeah . What is it ? Look . Martin , what am I looking at ? Blood cells . But this is 100 , maybe 1000 times normal , even for fresh blood . And you think this is Albert 's blood ? Don 't you ? I think you 're better than Jane Fonda . Heh . Thanks . Y 'know when I get this tug to where we 're going , it 's gonna be so much money . And mucho good life . Doesn 't look like you 're suffering too bad right now . Hahaha . This is nothing . I may tell you Bobbie , . you sure are one hell of a good looking woman . Thanks . When I saw you in the spa with your body shining in the sun , I nearly had to be restrained to keep from leaping over the railing . I guess that 's a compliment , huh ? It 's your perky little bugaboos ... Walter , I 'm trying to work out now . Well you just forget about that , cause I 'm getting real tired of you girls leading me on . From now on , you 're gonna play it my way or the game 's over , you get out . Walter , we 're miles out to sea , now how am I going to get out ? We 've got a lifeboat . Hah ! You wouldn 't dare . You wanna bet ? Walter , now don 't be stupid . Hey , what the hell are you doing ? Just get lost , kid , this is none of your business . Leave her alone ! Stop it ! Oh ! Aaahhhh ! The hell 's going on , Walt ? Dumb kid jumped me when I wasn 't looking . Oh yeah ? No , you can 't ! No ! Just watch me ... Mike ! Wait , hold it ! Stop ! Hey ! Hold it ! Corey ! Oh God . Agghhh ! Aaaaaggghhhh ! Ow ! Ugh ... My God . We 've got to stop the bleeding . I 'll get the first aid kit . What happened ? Mike ! What happened ? For God 's sake - The cat ! What ? The cat ! Oww ... His heart 's racing a mile a minute . His pulse is going crazy . What happened to him ? He just went nuts , I 've never seen anything like this . It 's not like him . Cat couldn 't have done this , look , it 's right through the shoe ! It was the cat ! That 's crazy , there 's no way a cat can do that . I don 't see how either . Somebody 'd better get on the radio and get some medical assistance , and fast or we 're liable to lose this thing . Okay , just keep this on there , alright ? Yeah . Suzanne , come with me . Suzanne , come here . Come here . Hold this button down and call " mayday , mayday . " I 'm going to find where the nearest medical facility is . Put that thing down . What are you doing ? I said put the damn radio down ! Are you crazy ? We had a deal about getting straight to the Caymans , remember ? Those two people might die if we don 't get them to a doctor . The kid 's gonna be alright . Mike is my problem . And do you want that boat or not ? Not with this much blood on it . Mayday , mayday . This is the Caribbean Sun , we have a medical emergency . I repeat - Mayday , mayday ! Now start the engine and get us headed for the Caymans . I 'm not taking this boat anywhere . I don 't think you 're gonna shoot the only person who can operate it . Fine . Then I 'll just blow her head off . And everyone else 's on board , one at a time until you get me where I wanna go . You wouldn 't dare . You 're way out of your league , sweetheart . Oh my God . This one goes right between her eyes . Alright ! Stop it , I 'll do it . Get this boat moving . Look , I 've told you that the engine is heating up . If it dies , we 're dead in the water , and I can 't guarantee I can fix it . You get this thing going right now ! Cut the crap , Rachel , and start this thing ! What the hell do you think I 'm trying to do ? Just get away ! Stop it ! No way ! You just stand back . This thing is going to start . What the hell happened here ? Aaagghhh ! Wait , wait ! Stop ! Hold it , you can 't let her - I mean , wait a minute , look , I 'm sorry ! Okay ? It 's just that I - Wait , wait ! Stop ! Hold it , you can 't let her - I mean , okay , I 'm sorry , alright ? It 's just that I - Alright , you 'll get your chance . Keep the gun on the scumbag , but if he moves ... blow his balls off . Ugh ... ugh ... As near as I can tell , the cat that bit Mr. Harvey is highly poisonous . A poisonous cat ? Now how 's that possible ? I found a piece of bloodstained shirt this morning . Rachel and I took a pretty good look at the blood . And it was mutating like nothing I 've ever seen or heard about . And the cat 's got rabies . Oh God . No , I 've seen rabies , I know what it does to the blood . This was a mutation . It 's definitely not rabies . Bobbie says she saw the cat while it was running from - Tell Martin what you told me . Well it all happened really fast . I dunno , it didn 't look like the cat , but it had to be . I dunno . His face was distorted or something , I don 't know . I mean ... Sounds crazy . I don 't know , did it look like a normal cat to you before , Suzanne ? Of course . It 's just a cat . Oh God , help me . Martin ? Could this have anything to do with that laboratory tag that that cat was wearing ? What are you talking about ? Shut up , Graham . You know , you 've been a major disappointment to me . Suzanne may be on to something . There 's a great deal of experimentation on lab animals . Maybe somehow this cat 's system has got some type of experimental chemical in it . I don 't know , it seems to me like out cat might administer that very same chemical - when it bites . Now if they 've given it some type of metabolic steroid , that might explain the strength of the bite to the shoe . You mean they actually poisoned that poor cat ? Now it 's dangerous to all of us . All I know for sure is that the blood cells in Mike 's body are multiplying at a phenomenal rate . Somehow , he 's been poisoned . You got some of Mike 's blood on your hands , how come you aren 't sick ? Most likely it can only be transmitted by actual contact with my blood , by ingesting it . Just touching it , or getting it on my skin shouldn 't hurt me . Oh God ! Oh God . Oh God ! Oh God ! What 's going to happen to us ? We 're going to survive . We 're going to get this boat started , and we 're going to survive . Is this really necessary ? Shut up . I can 't believe that you shot up that radio . Y 'know , you 're real lucky they won 't let me blow your head off . You wouldn 't have the guts to shoot me , even if they did let you , preppy . Rachel , I 've still got to get to the Cayman Islands . That 's the least of our problems . Let 's go . How you feeling ? I 'm okay . Really . What was that in the closet ? Probably just the boat creaking . How do you know ? And what if it 's the cat ? Don 't worry , I 'll go check . No , you stay here . I 'll do it . Are you sure ? Yeah . You ready ? Whew . Whew . It was just me and my father after that . This ship was his dream for both of us . Then we had some storm damage , and Dad got sick . We got behind on the payments to the bank , and Graham owns the boat now . So if I 'm ever gonna get this boat back , I gotta get this damn engine fixed . You see this pump here ? Yeah . It brings seawater in to cool the engine . I gotta trace every hose and electrical wire , and ... give me a hand here . You got a lot of nice stuff here for a creep , Graham . That 's what happens when you 've got money , preppy . Ain 't that the truth . And you don 't know the half of it . Mmmhmm . You like that ? You kiddin ' me ? Always wanted one of these . Keep it . What ? What , are you deaf as well as dumb ? Go ahead , take it , I 've got a drawer full of ' em . I guess you really are a rich S.O.B. , aren 't ya ? And gettin ' richer all the time . Here , lemme show you something - Whoa , not so fast . Hey ! Take it easy , man . I 'm just gonna get something out of the wall safe . Okay , nice and slow . There , you can open it . Be my guest . Go ahead . But you do it nice and slow so I can see everything . Very well . Feast your eyes . How much is that ? One million American dollars . Cold cash . Buy a lot of watches . Well , opportunity is knocking . Wake up . Take a bundle . There 's plenty more where that came from . Oh yeah ? How much more ? You help me get to my bank in the Cayman Islands , without any more hassles , and you 'll be using that as pocket change . You know , somehow I don 't trust you . Mr. Graham . I 'd be disappointed if you did . But try , son . Rachel . So ? So , it means any food the cat comes in contact with becomes contaminated . Yeah , but the food 's all locked up , right ? Yes , it 's safe . Cat 's gonna get awful hungry . What are you trying to say , Martin ? I 'm just saying that we gotta stay alert . That 's all . Mmm . Meow . Meow . Oh no , go away , please ! Ain 't nothing in here except us good pussycats . You almost scared me to death . C 'mon , what are you scared of , a little cat ? Yeah , you 're damn right I am . If you were smart , you would be too . Well , you want me to stay here and protect you from ze big bad boogeyman ? As a matter of fact , I would feel better with a big strong man here to protect me . And you know what ? I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep him here . If you really want to be protected ? You 're gonna be smart to stick by me no matter what happens from here on in . Why do you think I picked you from the beginning ? You 're obviously the one with the brains . Yeah that 's right , I 'm going places . I got it all worked out . Once we 're off this boat , things are just gonna slide into place . You mean , if ... if we ever get off this boat . We will . If I have to row this damn thing back to shore . I 'm gonna make things happen for me . Two days stranded . Dammit , you think we 'd find something out here . Okay , let 's give it a try , see what we got . Dammit ! I just don 't have the parts ! I just can 't keep - You 're doing the best you can . I never should 've left the port . You know , listening to Graham was the stupidest thing I could 've ever - Nobody 's blaming you . Just gotta keep trying . You 're right , Martin . I 'll be alright . I thought it was going to start this time . Yeah , me too . So how 's your shoulder , huh ? Better . Really . Except for the damndest thing . Lost all the feeling in my arm . Doesn 't hurt . Nothing , no feeling at all . Kind of tingles , y 'know , like when your arm falls asleep ? Mmmhmm . Well I know something that 'll help . Yeah ? Uh-huh . This is just what the doctor ordered . What is it ? I was just thinking , even though I lost the feeling in my arm , it doesn 't seem to affect other parts of my body . Here , lemme take a look at that boo-boo . Aaaggghhh ! Agghhh ! Get outta here ! Aaaagghhhh ! Aaaahhhh ! Aaahhhh ! Oh God , oh God ! Nooo ! Don 't worry - We 're all gonna die ! Didn 't you hear what Martin said ? Now get out of here ! No ! No ! No ! No , you heard what Martin said , I 'm poisoned ! I 'm already dead ! Oh , my hand ! You see that thing ? Did you see it ? I 've got the poison in my blood ! Wait ! Lance , it 's okay ! I 've got the poison in my blood ! Please don 't ! I know - Lance , no , wait ! It 's not like that , you don 't know ! I 've got the poison in my blood ! Please ! Lance ! No , wait ! Nooo ! Lance ! No , Lance ! I 'm going in too . Can you see ' em ? Here . Dammit . Can 't believe what happened . It 's just not real . He was yelling about having poison in his blood . There 's no more fresh water , how about some champagne ? Yeah . Save that . We 've got to tighten up on supplies . We 're all gonna die out here . I mean let 's face it , we 're all gonna die in this stupid boat . Take it easy , Suzanne . We 're not gonna die . We 're gonna survive . He 's right , Suzanne . We 're gonna make it . We 'll have that engine fixed in no time , right Martin ? That 's right . We 're almost got it . If we give up now we might as well just lie down and die . We 're gonna get out of here if we just keep fighting . You 're lying . You 're both lying ! We 're never gonna get out of this alive . We 're all gonna die ! That thing 's going to find us , and we 're all going to die a horrible death . Any luck ? No . Look , we need to let Walter Graham out . Never . Look , we don 't have much of a choice , we need his help . And what kind of help can he give us ? He can give us plenty of help . Look , while you two are fixing the motor , he and I can form some sort of a cat assault team . You don 't know Walter Graham like I do , and I don 't like the idea of letting him out . Corey 's right , we 're running out of time here . We can 't afford to have anybody not pull his weight . He and Graham can look for the cat , you and I can work on the boat around the clock . We can have Suzanne keep watch . Right . How 's that sound ? Alright then . It 's settled . Just get away from me . I 'm not helping you with anything . You will take watch like you 're told . No . Doesn 't even - Corey , Corey ... Hold on . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You wanna get off this boat , don 't you Suzanne ? Yes . We all do . And we 're going to . Everybody 's gotta help . They gotta do their job , you can understand that . And we need you to keep a watch out for planes or ships , okay ? Okay . You said it was good luck to bring a cat onboard . That 's right , I did . And it 's your fault that the cat 's here , it 's not mine . You 're right , you 're right . But I still need you to stay on watch . Okay . But I want Corey to know who 's at fault here ! It 's okay , Corey knows . Don 't you , Corey ? Yeah . Now come on and take the damn binoculars . I 'm going to go get Graham . Corey ! Yeah ? Be careful . Yeah , don 't worry about Walter , I can handle him . I meant the cat . Don 't worry , we 've got it all figured out , Mr. Graham . Yeah ? There 's still a chance I can get to my bank on time . Listen , that thing can jump out from anywhere . Let me have the gun . Look son , do you trust me ? Don 't you ? Let me have the gun . Yeah . Yeah , I trust you , Mr. Graham . Let 's nail this cat . Now I got some ideas ... Yeah , this looks like a prime spot . Yeah . Get these babies in the right places , and our little friend is history . Just the smell of that stuff is making me salivate . You know how much poison I put in it ? You 'd lose your appetite real quick . I 'll show Martin he 's not the only smart one around here after all . The hunt is still the hunt . I dunno , Martin . Maybe you 're right . If I can just hold out , I should be able to get that engine running . Yeah , if the food lasts that long . Here , your turn to serve dinner . Cereal again ! Will you be joining us ? No , I have a previous engagement to become a master mechanic . Well maybe I can interest you in a midnight snack ? That 's it ? ! What kind of food is this ? Where 's Corey ? He 's out checking his traps . God I hope he 's caught that thing . I can 't sleep with that cat crawling around . Well here 's to a dead cat . That cat knows the food 's poisoned . Ahh ! Aaahhhh ! Aggghhh ! Ahhhh ... Uggghhhh ... What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Something I should 've done days ago . You won 't last two days in that lifeboat . Our only chance is to stay with the ship and to get it going . Then maybe someone will spot us . How the hell 'd that thing get in here ? It 's lined with metal . I don 't know . Well how 'd you let that happen ? You were supposed to be in charge of the food . We didn 't let anything happen . You 've been sitting around on your ass the whole damn time we 've been working - on the engine , and the food and everything . I assume it pried through the sheet metal by itself with its own paws . Oh God , who cares . Now we don 't have any food left . Cat should be satisfied for now , with the contaminated food and water . Why the hell shouldn 't he be , he 's in a lot better shape than we are . We 're all gonna die anyways . What the hell are you - Oh ! I 'm looking for something to eat . I 'm starving to death . Suzanne , everything in here is contaminated . That 's what you say . I don 't believe you . You and Rachel are just hoarding it all for yourselves . Don 't be ridiculous . Suzanne , you 're gonna have to pull yourself together . This food is poisonous . It 's poisonous , do you understand me ? Everybody 's getting the same share of food . That 's just the way it is . I 'm sorry , Suzanne . Okay , I 'm going to the wheel . I 'm gonna hit the ignition switch . When I do , just pull that lever to the left . Okay ? Okay . What are you doing sleeping ? What , what ? You 're sleeping , you 're supposed to be keeping your eyes open . And what the hell are you doing ? Drop dead . I guess I should 've known better . Rachel ! If you haven 't noticed , it 's all over . It doesn 't matter . Nothing matters . Well you two may be ready to give up , but I 'm not . Well at least you 're being consistent . At being a dumb bitch . You know all you had to do to get this boat back was be nice to me . And you aren 't even smart enough to do that . And now you 're too dumb to know when to quit . Just like your dad . How do you think I got this boat ? I own this boat because I was smart and your daddy was dumb ! Like you ! Yeah , well you 're an idiot , Walter , and you always were . And you two can just stay out here and die if you want to , but not me . Hahahaha ! What are you laughing at ? You 're gonna die ! Hahahaha ! I knew it ! It 's just a pack of lies . Keeping all this food just for themselves . Don 't ! Get away from me ! No ! No , I only took a little bit ! You 're not going to hurt me . You 're a sweet little ... What are we gonna do , you gotta fix that ! Depends on the storm . What , well you 've gotta do something , it 's not going to stop in two minutes . We have to hurry ! We 're taking on too much water ! Where 's Graham ? I don 't know ! Come on , Graham ! I 've got one more briefcase ! I 'll be right back . We don 't have time ! Forget it ! We don 't have time ! One more briefcase ! I 'll be right back ! No , Graham ! Wait for me . Ah , ah ! No ! Where 's Graham ? ! I don 't know ! Forget about him ! I 'm going for him , you take it down ! Not without you ! We 've gotta do it , do it yourself , I 'll jump in and swim ! Come on ! Jump ! C 'mon , we gotta get out of here , she 's going down ! I 'm sorry , Rachel . Graham ? No , I wonder what was so important in this damn briefcase that he gave his life for it ? There must be a million dollars in there ! Enough to buy a new boat ! And to finance a study of that cat 's biology ! Yeah ! Aaahhhh ! Aaaiiieeee ! Aaeeiiiieee ! Agghhhh ! Did it bite you ? No , thank God , I think I 'm okay ! Good ! Rachel , it 's not over yet ! Aaahh ! Aaaiiieeee ! It won 't leave us alone so long as we 're the only floating object . What do we do ? Maybe the cat 'll get on this thing . No wait a minute ... Put it in here . Goodbye ! It 's getting on ! Aaaaagghhhh ! Whoo hoo ! Sorry to leave you waiting , but , understandably due to the storm , communications have been backed up . Now as to your story about a monster , poisonous cat . Well , I 'm afraid your ordeal must 've been too much for you . Right now you need rest and relaxation . If there 's any assistance I can be for you , contacting family , or friends ? Oh well , you 've been so kind . I really don 't know how to thank you . Haha ! It 's my pleasure to help . Thank you very much once again , you 've been more help than you 'll ever even begin to know . Thank you . Here kitty , kitty , kitty ! Here kitty , kitty , kitty ! Come here !

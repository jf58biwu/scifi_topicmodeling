 - You 're looking good , Dutch . - It 's been a long time , General . Come on inside . Eighteen hours ago , we lost a chopper ... carrying a cabinet minister and his aide from this charming little country . We 've got a transponder fixed on their position ... about here . This cabinet minister does he always travel on the wrong side of the border ? Apparently they strayed off course . And we 're fairly certain they 're in guerrilla hands . So why don 't you use the regular army ? What do you need us for ? Because some damn fool accused you of being the best . ( CHUCKLES ) Dillon ! You son of a bitch ! What 's the matter ? The C.I.A. got you pushing too many pencils ? Huh ? Had enough ? Make it easy on yourself , Dutch . - ( LAUGHS ) Okay , okay , okay ! - You never did know when to quit , huh ? - Damn good to see you , Dutch . - What is this fucking tie business ? Forget about my tie . I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin . - Very nice , Dutch . - Good old days . Like the good old days . Then how come you passed on Libya , huh ? - That wasn 't my style . - You got no style . You know that . Come on . Why did you pass ? We 're a rescue team , not assassins . Now , what do we got to do ? That cabinet minister is very important to our operations in this part of the world . The general 's saying a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed . We can 't let that happen . We need the best . - That 's why you 're here . - Go on . A simple setup . One-day operation . We pick up their trail at the chopper , run ' em down , grab those hostages ... and bounce back across the border before anybody knows we were there . - What do you mean , " we " ? - I 'm going in with you , Dutch . General , my team always works alone . You know that . I 'm afraid we all have our orders , Major . Once you reach your objective ... Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge . ♪ ♪ ( MAN SINGING ON RADIO ) ( SPEAKING INDISTINCT ) Roger . Over . Yeah , okay . ( CHUCKLES ) - MAN ON RADIO : Delta 1-0 . - MAN : Roger .

It looks more like a surveillance bird to me . Pick up the trail yet ? Billy 's on it . Heat-seeker , Dillon . That 's pretty sophisticated for a ... - bunch of half-assed mountain boys . - Major ! I guess they 're getting better equipped every day . There were 12 guerrillas . They took the two men from the helicopter , but there 's something else . - What do you mean ? - Six men wearing U.S.-issued army boots . They came in from the north , and then they followed the guerrillas . Mean anything to you ? Probably just another rebel patrol . They operate in here all the time . - Get ahead and see what you can find . - Yes , sir . ( BIRDS SQUAWKING ) What 's he got ? Same business .

Nobody told me there was an operation in this area . - They shouldn 't have been here . - But somebody sent them . The guerrillas skinned them ? Why did they skin them ? Ain 't no way for no soldier to die . - What happened here , Billy ? - Strange , Major . There was a firefight . They were shooting in all directions . I can 't believe that Jim Hopper walked into an ambush . I don 't believe he did . I can 't find a single track . Just doesn 't make sense . What about the rest of Hopper 's men ? There 's no sign , sir . They never left here . Hell , it 's like they just disappeared . Stick with the guerrilla trail . Let 's get the hostages . We move , five-meter spread . No sound .

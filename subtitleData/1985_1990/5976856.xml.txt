 [ music continues ] Daddy wanted me to have the party at the Olympia Hotel . Now , that would 've been a bit much . But a little birthday celebration in the school gym .. ... it 's so modest , it 's almost tacky . I 'm sure it 'll be a neat party . Ah , if it 's neat , I 'll kill myself . I want it to be unique , and thrilling , and exciting . Eighteen is a special year for a girl and I 'm looking forward to a very special present from you . I put money down on a two-dollar birthday card if I can make the payments , it 's yours . Clark , the only thing that I want from you ... is you . Look at Clark . Isn 't that enough to make you sick ? What ? The tuna melt ? Not what he 's eating , dummy . What he 's looking at and how . Hey , Clark . Hi . Dude . [ both laughs ] I really like Lana . Yeah , she 's great . But she sure doesn 't like me . It 's too bad . My daddy always said that if you wanna be somebody in this world you have to make everyone you meet either love you or hate you . Oops ! Daddy will be here any minute now . Oh ! And I 'm in my leotard . He 's so old-fashioned . Oh , no no . Let me take care of that . Come on . Tell you what , give me ten minutes and send him over to the Segal Center . Tell him I 'll meet him there , okay ? - Okay , great . - Thanks . What does he look like ? He 'll be in a silver limo , and that 's my daddy . - Okay , great . - Thanks . Bye . TJ , take care of that for me . What ? [ whirring ] - Sure this is going to work ? - Relax , Arnie . It 's the same kind of bomb we always use . Once we blow Mr. Danner to the wild blue yonder we 're out of here . Get in , get in . Let 's go . Go . [ Whoosh ] [ upbeat music ] [ boom ] Who 's that ? I don 't know . [ tires screech ] - You okay ? - Yeah . ( male # 1 ) Aah ! You alright ? I 've felt better . I don 't know , I don 't know what you did or how you did it , but there 'll be a reward . Get the young man 's address , Barney . [ sirens approaching ] ( male # 1 ) Wait ! [ car doors close ] [ camera clicking ] Perfect . [ sighs ] [ indistinct chatter on police radio ] Sir ? Sir , I 'm Clark Kent , with the Shuster University Herald . I wanted a statement from you as to what happened . A bomb exploded near my car . End of statement . Excuse me . Okay , Danner . What are you doing in my town ? Sir ? Sir , could you give me a statement ? Uh , you 're from that college , aren 't you kid ? Yes , sir . Look I haven 't got time for you right now . Please . Miller , please , have these people back off . Alright , Danner . I don 't think you 're gonna be one of my favorite people . Let me see your badge . Congratulations , Detective Harris . I 'm gonna see that you have an early retirement .. ... beginning next week . Trembling with fear . I don 't know who 's trying to waste you . I don 't give a hoot . If you waste him first , good luck to you but if you 're gonna be blowing each other up do it on your turf . This is a college town . Don 't want kids getting hurt . ( Sara ) Daddy ! - Sara . - Are you alright ? Oh , sure . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . I promise I 'll have my doctor send you a note . Okay . Clark ! Have you met Clark , Daddy ? Oh , this is Clark ? Yes , we met . - I need to talk to you . - Okay . - Nice meeting you , Clark . - Nice to meet you , sir . Get Frank from lab to go through this . And get these kids away from the fire , please . Detective Harris , can you spare a moment now ? Alright , kid , one question , but I 'm busy . Who 's , who 's Mr. Danner ? You call yourself a reporter and you don 't know who Matt Danner is ? That 's Matt Danner . He 's head of one of the biggest crime syndicates on the East Coast . So what do you think about Sara now ? I 'll let you know . I might find out what crime syndicate she 's head off . I 'm afraid , sweetheart , that I 'm gonna miss your party . Oh , Daddy ! Attempts on my life always ruin my day . Police are gonna give me a hard time and besides , I 've got to get back to town and ... handle things . Please be careful , Daddy . If you can 't be good , you gotta be careful . Happy birthday , baby . - Yeah ? - Daddy ! Mr. Casey , Jake . - Something 's wrong . - Yes and no . Good news is the bomb went off . Bad news is Mr. Danner didn 't go off with it . Listen , Mr. Casey , this was not our fault . We 'll make it up to you . I want the both of you back here as soon as possible . Got it ? Listen to me , Benny .. ... Casey 's got to be behind it . Now , use the whole organization if you have to but I want that no-good rat hung out to dry and I want it done yesterday . Before the cops become my partners . I 'll tell you why not the cops . Because if they nab him first , then he ends up in a cozy jail protected by bars and lawyers . Let 's save the tax payers some money . Bring Casey in refrigerated . [ pop music ] # It 's a fine mess we 're into # # It 's a fine mess # # It 's the kind of mess I 'm used to # # It 's a fine mess we 're into # What 's your name , good looking ? It 's been so long I almost forgot . Sorry I 'm late . Had to put the paper to bed . You know , big time reporter stuff . Ah . [ club music ] Who 's that big guy over in the corner , to my right ? ( Sara ) My bodyguard . Your bodyguard ? What can I say ? Every time there 's an attempt on Daddy 's life I always end up with a bodyguard . You never told me that your father is ... Matt Danner . So ? I never told you that Ross Danner is my mother . Or that Gloria , Lavinie and Claire are my first cousins . I love my father , and I 'm proud of him . The paper prints a pretty grim picture of him . They call him head of a crime syndicate . You know what I think is criminal ? It 's people building the hydrogen bomb that can destroy the world . How about those creeps who are polluting their environment ? Clark , my dad may bend the law every now and then but what he does is nothing compared to the self-righteous , hypocritical politicians who rob us deaf , dumb and blind . I don 't know . You 're a great attorney for the defense but I have to think about it . Okay . [ music continues ] TJ , if you want to catch me by star light leave your camera behind . Okay . I could dance all night . I can 't stay that long . I have a sociology paper to write before I hit the sack . I don 't believe you . Good night , Sara . Clark . Clark , don 't leave me yet . You still owe me ... my birthday present . Clark .. [ romantic music ] That was a C minus . Maybe we can try it with your arms around me this time . That was an A minus . If you hold me a little tighter , maybe we can get an A plus . When I get passionate , I 'm an animal . I might cause you bodily harm . A little pain never hurt anyone . Good night , Sara . [ sighs ] I can 't believe this is happening to me . Not in the twentieth century . [ dramatic music ] Look , I 'll tell you one more time . When I came to , I ran up to Sara 's room , and she was gone . So I called Mr. Danner immediately then drove to the hospital , I got my head stitched up then went back to the hotel . So why didn 't you call the police ? I don 't work for the police . I work for Mr. Danner . This is a police station , not a police state . What right do you have to detain my employee ? What are the charges ? Your daughter 's been kidnapped and you 're worrying about this punk ? It 's none of your business who I worry about . My daughter wasn 't kidnapped , she ran away . We had a quarrel . It 's her way of punishing me . She ran away ? And she didn 't even pack a suitcase ? Didn 't take her purse , her credit cards ? You know she was kidnapped and I have a hunch you know who did it . Don 't leave town , Danner . You can reach me at the Peabody . Mr. Danner ? Mr. Danner ? Hi , kid . Sara 's my friend , and maybe I can help . You really like my kid a lot , huh ? Yes , sir . At least we 've got that in common . Hop in . [ police siren blaring ] In your opinion ... is ripping a man 's heart out more painful than cutting his throat ? Forget it . Superboy . Excuse me ? Superboy . That 's who I could use right now . I don 't know why he saved me in the first place . I don 't know him . I never did anything for him . Maybe I did . He must feel obligated . Superboy could find Casey for me like that . Why are you always looking at your watch ? I 'm late now . I got an appointment at my doctor 's to get my stitches taken out . [ whirring ] ( Danner ) Oh , if you miss it , I 'll send you to my vet . [ phone rings ] Yes ? This is Casey . I don 't know what rock you 're hiding under but I 'm gonna find you . ( Casey on phone ) Don 't count on it . If we 're gonna play hide and seek you don 't stand a chance . First , let me put your daughter on . Say hello to your daddy , Sara . Daddy , please help me . Please help me . Thank you , Sara . You 're a dead man , Casey . ( Casey on phone ) Well , we all have to die some time , Danner . Even the children we love . [ dramatic music ] What the .. You 're either a quick healer , or a bad liar . What are you talking about ? I 'll show you what I 'm talking about . Whoa ! Do you like to fly ? Yeah , only in a 747 . Well , I 'm not a wide body Although , if you find me comfortable I tire easily . Where are you taking me ? I don 't know you 're the pilot . Just point me to the direction Casey 's holding Sara and I 'll take you there . Casey who ? Whoa ! Think you can remember what Casey I 'm talking about ? I work for Mr. Danner ! - I 'm getting impatient . - Whoa ! He 's on a yacht . A rented yacht . Somewhere in the Marina . I don 't have time for somewhere . You point me . Okay , okay . Now , can we discuss this as reasonable men ? Go to hell . I can 't oblige . I 've got business in this state . Your business . Over my dead body . If necessary . That 's the way you ran the Dutchman out of town and that 's our tradition in our line of work . [ dramatic music ] - Is that the Marina ? - Yes . Which yacht ? That 's her . [ siren blaring ] [ tires screeching ] crash I 'll tell you what , here 's the deal . Why don 't you find yourself a nice little place to live out of town ? Like in Europe ? I 'll give you five percent of the take , plus your daughter . I 'm not giving up what I worked for all my life for anything . Now , shove your offer ! Sara , it 's time to say goodbye to your daddy . Daddy , give him what he wants ! Don 't let him kill me ! Sara , were-were you listening ? [ sobbing ] Daddy , give him what he wants ! Listen , Sara . I can 't turn the syndicate over to him but he 's not going to kill you . You 're just a bargaining chip . You be brave . We 'll find him . Jake ! Look at that . That 's , that 's the guy ! Casey , it 's him ! The guy with the red cape ! Mr. Casey ! Let 's get out of here . [ theme music ] Stop ! Take one step , I 'll blow the girl to bits . Now , freeze ! Freeze . Good idea . [ wind blowing ] Ugh ! Aah ! Superboy , what 's going on here ? This is your kidnapper . I suggest you arrest him and take him down to headquarters to defrost him . I wish you weren 't leaving school . I need to get away , and get my head straight . I 'm gonna miss you . What do you think you 're doing ? Please , leave us alone . Please . Sara , you can 't leave me . You left me first . I would have been dead . If it wasn 't for Superboy , I would 've been dead . ( Danner ) Oh , no , no . We would 've made some arrangement sooner or later . " Sooner or later " . How comforting ! I want you out of my life , Dad . Where , where are you going ? Some place . Any place . Doesn 't even matter . Goodbye , Dad . [ engine revs ] You really liked her , didn 't you ? Yeah , I liked her . Did you guys , um ... ever spend the night together ? That 's sick ! What kind of question is that ? That 's rude . Sorry . You don 't have to answer . I won 't . - But if you want to know- - - No , I don 't . - I 'm telling you anyway . - No . It never went beyond a passionate kiss . [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

 Edward ! Pretorious ! Go away ... Now listen to me . I 've got to talk to you . The resonator , it 's working ! If this is your idea of a joke ... Listen to me . The new program , it worked ! Just like you said . My God ! Do you feel it , Crawford ? Turn it off . Edward ! Shut it off ! Never ! Can 't you feel it , Crawford ? In the mind . The mind ! It 's out of control , you 've got to turn it off ! No , I want to see more ... more than any man has ever seen ! Edward ... It 's running itself ! Something 's ... coming ... They 're at it again ! With the coloured lights and the weird sounds ! Last time I called , you said you 'd send a squad car if there was another disturbance . Well , I 'm disturbed ! Hello ? Ah ! Bunny ! Come back ! Bunny ! Bunny ... Please ... Oh , God ! - Oh , my God ! - Come on ! Bunny ! FROM BEYOND Dr. Bloch , I 'm Jordan Fields from the D.A. ' s office . This is Dr. Catherine McMichaels . - Hello . - I 've read some of your work . Very impressive . Well , yes . So is this facility . Though if you 've read my work , you know I 'm not in favour of locking away schizophrenics . Yes , I know . You 're in favour of using them in experiments , like ... lab animals . We 've asked Dr. McMichaels for her expert opinion on the sanity of Crawford Tillinghast . As it pertains to his ability to stand trial for the murder of Edward Pretorious . Thank you . Oh , just a minute . Ray ? Thank you . And ... Forgive me , God in Heaven . Get them out of here ! He 's in here , Doctor . Crawford ? This is Doctor Catherine McMichaels . Hello . I suppose you 're another psychiatrist . Yes , I am . And you 're a physicist . Your record at Miskatonic University was brilliant . Yes , well ... I had quite a future , didn 't I ? Yes , you were working with Edward Pretorious . I was assisting Dr. Pretorious with his experiments , yes . What was the purpose of the experiments ? To stimulate the pineal gland with resonant vibrations . The pineal gland ? Why ? Dr. Pretorious believed the pineal was a dormant sensory organ . A sixth sense . Yes , well that 's not a new theory . The philosopher Descartes believed it was a third eye . It 's not a theory , it 's a fact ! Then your experiments worked . They proved the theory . Yes . Then what went wrong ? Nothing ... At first . But then we saw them . What did you see ? We saw creatures . We saw creatures , these ... Things , that were swimming around in the air . They fill it ! All the time . - Are they around us now ? - You bet . Only we can 't see them without the resonator . And they can 't see us , unless they 're under the influence of the vibrations . That 's why I had to destroy it ! Destroy what ? The resonator ! Pretorious ' invention ! Because ... Because ... It ... came . What came ? Dr. Tillinghast ? Crawford , what did you see ? It ate him . Bit off his head . Like a gingerbread man . Crawford ? Dr. McMichaels . I 'm not mad . I saw it ! I saw it ! Do you hear me ? I saw it ! Why doesn 't anyone believe me ? We can 't reach him . He keeps returning to the same fantasy ... Let 's do a CAT scan on him . Why ? You 've already seen everything you need to see . There 's always more to see . No machines ... - Please ... - It 's alright . You 'll be alright . I promise . Oh , God , no ... Oh , my God ... There , do you see that ? ! The pineal gland is oversized and extending through the optic thalami Think the tumor is causing his delusions ? I don 't think that 's a tumor ... I think the pineal gland is growing ... - That 's impossible ... - I know ! But the CAT scan bears it out The pineal stalk is elongating through the brain . Wait a minute . I don 't know the inside of brains . What does all this mean ? Well it could mean that the experiment they were perfoming actually does stimulate the pineal . You mean he 's not crazy ? I don 't know ... He actually believes that he saw these creatures ... It still doesn 't explain how Pretorious died or what happened to his head ! I 'd like to recreate their experiment , and i 'll need Tillinghast to do it ! That is absurd ... and unethical ! I know your methods . The girl wonder ... You use your patients so you can make your great discoveries ! At least here we try to cure them ... By locking them up ? Giving them drugs , taking their lives away ? I can give him his life back ! I 'll give you an expert opinion : Crawford Tillinghast is a classic paranoid schyzophrenic , and a dangerous one . If I can recreate the experiment , then I can find out what happened to Pretorious . I 'd like nothing better than to lock this guy up . I 've got a dead man with his head twisted off covered in some shit the pathologists can 't even identify ! No other fingerprints found , except Tillinghast 's ... No blood on the axe , no blood anywhere ... I want to know what the hell happened up there . He 's all yours . You 're my patient now , Dr. Tillinghast . Thank You . I 'll call for an apointment . No , wait a minute . You 've been released into my custody , you have to come with me . Where are you planning on taking me ? Back to the Pretorious House . I want you to recreate your experiment . No . Look , you can either stay here for the rest of your life , or you can come with me . That 's not much of a choice , is it ? I believe you Crawford , I want to see what you saw . Hi , you must be Dr. McMichaels ? No , I 'm Dr. McMichaels . - Oh , hi . - Hello . - Then you must be ? - This is Dr. Crawford Tillinghast . The crazy . I 'm Sgt. Bufford Brown , but my team mates call me Bubba . I used to play pro football . We were all crazy ... Not exactly cheery . PRETORIOUS FOUNDATION Sorry about that ... Child-proof lock . Last stop . Everybody Out . Dr. Tillinghast , would you care to show us around ? Doctor , if you 're telling us the truth , the only way to free yourself is to go back . Through this door . Come on Doc , there 's nothing to be afraid of . Look , I 'll show you . See , what did I tell you ? - Bubba , are you alright ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . Electrical cables . We needed more power , so ... they rewired the whole house . Where are the circuit breakers , Doctor ? Doctor ? Damn it , we lost him ! He knows this place better than we do . First thing is to find the power . - Hey , wait a minute . - What ? I bet these cables lead to the resonator . First we find our missing mental patient . I want more yelling ! More yelling , bitch ! This guy was into some weird shit . Your mouth I want to kiss ! That 's him . Dr. Edward Pretorious . I don 't care about his private life . Pretorious ' resonator . I heard you hacked up Pretorious . That 's were I hid it ! I knocked a fork off . There ... There it is . What do you want me to do with it ? - Let him go . - Are you crazy too ? He 's reliving it . The night of the murder . Let him go ! Ian says you call the signals ... Yes . Yes . This is how it was . That 's where it ate him . Wait a minute . What ate who ? We can start in the morning , Crawford . I 've started . Alright . All this talking about eating is making me hungry . How about we have some dinner ? The real danger here is starving . Pretty , isn 't she ? She 's beautiful ... So how 's it going , Doc ? Need some help ? He used to bring beautiful women here ... Eat fine meals , drink fine wine , listen to music ... But it always ended with screaming . And I would just lie there and listen to them ... screaming . You boss had some screws loose . He was a genius . It 's just that the five senses weren 't enough for him , he wanted more . Is it finished ? Are we ready ? Yes . I had to bypass the computer because the magnetic field erased the program . And of course the monitors are completely useless . So , the entire system has to be manually operated . And unfortunately the resonator was so severely damaged that I had to convert it to just an on / off system . When we reach 20 000 MHz , we throw this switch and a powerful magnetic field vibrates these forks at a precise frequency . Stimulating the pineal gland , allowing us to see with it . Listen to me : don 't move when we 're in the field of the vibrations . - Why ? - You move , and they may see you . It will see you . What is this it anyway ? Pray you don 't see it for yourself . I 'm staying right by this switch . If it appears , I 'm shuting down . Are you sure we 're ready for this ? - Yes . - Please ... Remember : stay still . This looks real great , people . Oh , man ... What the hell is that ? - What ? - I don 't know what . Don 't move ! Holy shit ! Is this what you saw ? Yes , these things are around us all the time . It 's coming . - Bubba ! Are you alright ? - Lost a little piece , but I 'll be fine . When you move in the field , it can sense you . How far does the field extend ? I 'm turning it off . Crawford ... No ... - Who is it ? - Show yourself . Welcome home , Crawford . I 'm glad you came back . Who 's the lovely woman ? It can 't be you ... Doctor Pretorious ? You have me at a disandvatange , my dear ... Crawford , where are your manners ? Bring your friend to me . I saw you die . No , not die , just pass beyond . It was horrible ! A necessary rite of passage , quite wonderful in fact . Where have you been hiding ? Move towards me , my dear . I want to see you . - How ... - Did I survive ? I am the master here . Is it ... Is it really you , Edward ? Touch me , if it pleases you . If it helps you understand . It 's just the body ... but my mind is indivisible ! Bodies change . That will be quite enough of that . I feel excelerated . We almost died ... Incredible creature . It must have total bodily control on a molecular level . Yes , and Edward 's mind . He became the thing that ate him . Crawford , we saw the same things . We 've proved you 're not insane . I 'm not so sure ... You faced your fear and you overcame it . You saved our lives . Yeah , I owe you one . Want some breakfast ? How can you eat after that ? Can 't work without eating ... What work ? I thought I 'd record the results . The pineal gland was stimulated . It gave me one hell of a headache . Expansion of the pineal . I 'll have to do a study of CAT scans of scyzophrenics . If there 's a statistical correlation between scyzophrenia and an enlarged pineal ... They may be seeing or feeling what we saw . Their minds may be influenced by those creatures . How about the hard on I got ? Is there statistical correlation for that too ? Well ... we know that the pineal gland helps to regulate the sex drive . Perhaps pineal stimulation causes ... an accompagnying sexual stimulation . There 's so much to learn ... Well , we learned what we came for . He ain 't crazy and that ... it ate Pretorious ' head . They 're gonna think we 're crazy , but that 's their problem . We 'll just have to try the experiment again . Did you say we ? Catherine , you can 't . You don 't mean to go back up there now , do you ? You always run an experiment twice , to check the results . Wait . I saw it get to him , Catherine . Just exactly what you 're feeling and it ruined him . Pretorious . I 'd like to know more about him . That resonator is a work of genius . Were we in the same nightmare ? Didn 't we just almost all get eaten by an it ? All it takes is a hand on the switch . If it appears , you make it disappear . I 've got a better idea . How about if we disappear out the door ? Don 't you understand ? This is the greatest discovery since van Leeuwenhoek first looked through a microscope and saw an amoeba ! But he wasn 't down there with the amoebas ! I have to find out if the pineal gland is really the key . Fine ! But not here . Not now . Under controlled conditions . But we have control . No one knows that resonator better than you do . You 're right ! And that 's why no one is touching it . Crawford ! This could be the first step in curing scyzophrenia . Crawford ... My father spent 15 years in an institution . He died in one . They called his condition incurable . They tried everything : drugs , shock therapy , even surgery . They turned him into a vegetable . I 'm sorry ... We can save so many others . Please , Crawford ... We can do it . Help me . Help you ? Help you to take your mind ... and shatter it ! I can 't . And I won 't let you . I 'm the law here . You turn on that machine and it 's reckless endangerment . Look , we all need some rest . Why don 't we just get some sleep and then we 'll think about it . We get some rest and then we 're going . Turn it off ! No ... I have to see more ... Feel more ! Turn it off ! No . We 've got to stop it . Aww ... Don 't stop ... I 'm impressed Crawford . Do you realise now what I was creating ? Edward , my God , what have you become ? Myself . Get the swich and I 'll distract him . Yes , I do find you distracting . Don 't , Crawford ! Listen to me . Whatever you are , you 're still Edward Pretorious . You 're still human ! More than human ... Join me , forever . Everyone must join me . We 'll be waiting for you , Crawford ! What the hell are you going to do ? Circuit breaker . I 'm gonna have to turn it off ! Damn ! Smell ... Taste ... In another life , I would of enjoyed you in another way ... Messing with that damn machine again ! What the hell is that ? Vibrations must reach down here . I 'll be right back . What are you going to do to me ? I 'm going to kiss you ... Oh my God ! I 'm sorry . I really thought that I could control it . It 's changing us , Doc . All of us . And not for the better . I was wrong to turn on the resonator with other subjects present . It 's clear now that only one person should run the experiment . This ain 't an experiment ! It 's suicide ! The presence of other subjects causes dangerous distractions ! I can stand right at the master switch to maintain control of that resonator , but I must do it myself . I know this behaviour . I 've seen it in the streets . You may be a scientist , lady , but right now you 're acting like a junkie . Just take him and leave ! Wrap him up , I 'll get the van ready . Put some clothes on , unless you want me to take you kicking and screaming like that ... What the hell are you doing ? I told you to get dressed . I did . The van 's ready . You 're going like that ? What a shame ... I just ... love what you have done with this room ... You 're asking for it . Look at yourself ! Is that who you are ? I don 't know ... I don 't know who I am ... Listen ! Crawford , we 're leaving now . No , listen , the resonator ! It 's him ! He 's trying to start the resonator , from beyond ! Son of a bitch ! Bastard ! Bubba , pull the cable ! Use the axe ! Damn ! Oh no , God ! No ! Bubba ! Catherine ... Crawford ! Kiss ... Kiss , my dear ... Humans are such an easy prey ... Let her go ! Oh , I will ... Beyond her wildest dreams ... She will go into my mind , and I will go into hers ... It 's the greatest sensual pleasure there is ! You never knew pleasure , nor gave it . Only pain ! You are evolving into a being that has never existed before . I 'm Crawford Tillinghast ! Let it happen , Crawford ... Let it out ! Crawford ! Oh , it 's so beautiful ... So ... beautiful ! Now you can truly see ... What have you done to him ? I only awakened his sleeping pineal gland . It did the rest itself . No ! Crawford ... You whore ! Die , you fucker ! Oh , Crawford ... The police are here . She 's been telling us a pretty wild story . I have been telling you the truth ! We 'd like your opinion of her mental state . I 'd rather give you my opinion of her professional conduct . You 're contemptible . Look at her ! I doubt she even understands what she 's done ! You cost Crawford Tillinghast his mind . Quite possibly his life ! And another man 's life . That machine has got to be destroyed ! I listened to you the first time and now I 've lost one of my best men . The DA 's going to chew me a new asshole , thanks to you ! She 's in your custody now . No , wait a minute , you can 't lock me up ! Not here , please ! I can 't do much with her in this agitated state , she 'll upset the other patients . Do whatever you think best . Listen , Dr. Bloch , please ... You know that I 'm sorry for everything that I 've done . You have got to let me go back ... Don 't you tell me what I have got to do , girl wonder . You always have all the answers , don 't you ? Well , you 're my patient now . And I 've got a few answers myself . Prepare her for electro-shock therapy . But , Dr. Bloch , hospital policy ... Hospital policy dictates that the nursing staff is to follow orders ! Now do as I say . Yes , doctor . Stop her ! My God , Bloch , no ! Send her up to no . 5 . I 'm going to check on Tillinghast . If she continues to resist , sedate her . Please , don 't do this . It 's not necessary . I 'm alright now . He 's gone . Call security ! Crawford . Please don 't eat those . They 're delicious . They 'll make you very sick . God ... What is happening to me ? We don 't know for sure ... but we 're going to find out . We 're going to go in the hall now , Crawford . Take it easy , honey . Come , quick , something 's happened and we need your help . Wait a minute , what about her ? Lock her up in a room . Catherine ? Catherine ! You better hurry , before he goes into DT . And get me a candybar , I 'm starving . Harley ? Harley , what 's going on ? I saw ... A snake ... came out of his head ... It ate him ... Shit , Harley , you son of a bitch , he 's gone into DT . Harley , you alright ? That 's the snake man , that 's him ! Somebody help me ! Oh my God , help ! Help , somebody ! Crawford , stop ! Crawford , let me go ! Crawford , stop ! Why are you doing this ? Because I love you , Catherine . Crawford , we have to get out of here , the resonator 's going to blow up ! I want us to be together ... Listen to me ! I set a timing device on a bomb , we only have a few minutes ! It doesn 't matter . If Pretorious can turn on that machine , then he 'll always have a way back here . He 's always here ... Don 't you understand ! He won 't just influence us ! He 'll devour us and the rest of the human race if he can ! You 're so beautiful ... Please , Crawford ! It won 't hurt , I promise . Crawford ! Help me ! Catherine ? Welcome , my dear ... I 've been waiting for you ... Edward , no ! Yes ... The greatest sensual pleasure there is is to know the desires of another mind . I know your desires , you impotent pig ! We are the most powerful being in the universe ! She 'll know , Edward ... How pathetic you are ! How you can 't make love ! Maybe you can teach me ... Crawford ! Alright ! Come and get me , eunoch ! This time I 'm not running away ! Catherine , run ! Crawford ! Crawford ! I 've called the fire department . They 'll get you to the hospital . Oh my god ! What happened up there ? It ... ate ... him ...

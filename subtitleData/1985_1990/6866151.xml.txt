 Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * * Who are you ? Your mother was my friend . What do you want from me ? ! I wanna help you . I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . You know ? They 're not really made of dogs . That 's true , they 're made out of beef , pork , water , salt , Dexterous , sodium ascorbate , corn syrup and sodium matrim . Hey , look at this , one of my pictures . See ? Photo by Paul Forrester . Are you kidding ? The real Paul Forrester took those ! You haven 't even figured out how to use the camera ! It 's simple . I read the manual . I bet I can go over there right now and take a picture just like this one . You 're on ! I 'll wait here . Would you say that is hazy bright or open shade ? Yeah , you know it 's a little beat up but it still runs pretty good . How fast will it go ? Fast ! Hey , get a shot of me ! Get off of that , we 're going . Wait a minute ! I wanna talk to you about something . Hey what are you doing ? We have to go , now . Thanks anyway . Yeah . I don 't get it , all of a sudden you 're treating me like I was still wet behind the ears . and you can 't just walk in after 14 years and start playing protecting father . That 's what fathers do . Yeah , but I know more about taking care of myself than you do . Why are we in such a hurry anyway ? One of the boys back there fell down on his motorcycle . A truck was coming . Oh , you didn 't do anything weird , did you ? I had to help him . Well , I am old enough to ride a motorcycle . The boy that fell broke his armbone . I don 't want you to break your armbones . I can break my arm crossing , Look out ! Scott , what 's wrong ? I think my arm is busted . Don 't move . OK , so it 's not broken but it could have been . Come on ! Snap it up ! We gotta get this plane off the road before some other jack-ass comes along and drives into it . Hello ! I 'm Paul Forrester . How lucky for you , now get back by the tail and swing it around when I tell you . You ! Grab the wing . Just a second lady ... Better hurry up ! Here comes another jack-ass . Well , how do you like highway landings ? You were supposed to gas it up last night . Yes , checking the gas is more or less the job of a pilot . Are you OK , Mister ? I think we 're OK . Joe Floss . Paul Forrester . Seems you had a close call . Yeah , my car almost hit a plane . Seems to me it might have been the other way around ! Are you trying to get us into a lawsuit ? I nearly busted my arm , lady ! What he means is , he could have busted his arm . All of his bones are intact . Really ? Let 's take a look ! That feels OK but you know , sometimes it 's hard to tell . Busted mine once playing football , finished the half before I even noticed it . What 's your name , son ? Scott . I 'll tell you what , Scott Squeeze as hard as you can The boy 's got quite a grip ! Thanks . Call me Joe . I guess we better take a look at your car . If you 're gonna break in playing Good Samaritan routine , Joe you might try and get the ship back to the airport . It 's a real piece of work that woman , no question ! She 's upset because you came to help her ? Yeah ! You get that on the head . I reckon there 's nothing a woman hates more than making a mistake when there 's a man around who told her not to do it in the first place . Let 's take a look at that car of yours . Joe , you play for the pro 's ? No , just high school . I might have gone on but Uncle Sam had other plans for me . It 's bleeding . It sure is . You got a cracked oil pan here . I 'll tell you what we 'll do if that 's alright with you . We 'll tow this back to the airport , and have it fixed up for you as good as new in no time if that 's alright Great ! Paul ? How much time is ... no time ? Don 't worry about it , if we can 't get to it by tonight we got plenty of bunk space . Bennett Aviation will take care of everything . So just grab your gear and we 'll head on back . Looks like all our problems are solved . Come on . I can take off right from here , boys . I 'll be back in about 20 minutes . Are you a pilot ? Yeah . Chief test pilot for this outfit . You 're a test pilot ? I 'm getting ready to ring out Conrad Bennett 's last design . The Hawk . It 's gonna set the airplane business on his ear . Wow , whose bike ? Why , you like bikes ? Yeah ! Hop on the back and pretend you 're riding . Alright ! Why don 't you climb up front and pretend like you 're driving ? It 's perfectly safe ! It 's not big deal , it 's only a couple of miles to the airport . I 'll tell you what , I 'll hold on real tight , OK ? I want you up front . I think you best do what your Dad says . I know what your thinking , Dad I 've been hearing since I was 6 years old . Conrad Bennett 's first law : Test pilot 's always right . It 's what keep him alive . But Joe 's so damned cautious , and we 're running out of time . I went to the bank this morning and talked to Sam , he says if we can 't show the investors some results soon , we could lose everything . One way or the other , we gotta get the Hawk into the air . Mister Forrester ! Glad Joe brought you back . Gives me the chance to apologize . My behaviour this afternoon was inexcusable . Please forgive me . You 're a real piece of work , no question ! Yes , I suppose I am . Nonetheless , I hope that you and the boy with the broken arm will be our guests for dinner . The boy should have your ship gassed up by now boss , I 'll got fetch it . I 'll see you guys later . Joe , will you be back for dinner ? It 's up to you . We 'll set a place for you . Joe ! If you 're gonna be coming back , Can I go with you ? No , I got some work to do . I 'll tell you what , I was thinking about taking a ride out into the dessert , If it 's OK with your Dad , maybe you can hitch a ride . Really ? You check with him . I 'm sure he 'll be fine ! Let me know . Thank you . Paul , this is my father , Conrad Bennett . I guess I should have prepared you . How do you do ? I 'm Paul Forrester . I 've heard a lot about you . You 're very kind . Most people aren 't so sensitive . But I know Dad can hear us , I know when I talk to him , he understands . He understands . That 's why he 's afraid . Afraid ? He 's afraid for you . All fathers worry about their children , don 't they ? So , I saw Fulton hit the water and clear his chute . He was all shot out . So I blew off the lid , popped the seat and went in after him . I cost the tax-payers about four mill . Four mill ? Right ! We 're talking heavy bucks . The cost of a plane and everything . That 's right . You miss that comradery , don 't you ? I miss the trust we had in each other . We have to get some sleep . Thank you for the fish . I was thinking about hanging out with Joe for a little while . Scott , it 's time to go to bed . Good night , Scotty . So is it that you are gonna start telling me when my bedtime is now ? It 's late ! I 'm not tired . Stop hovering over me , OK ? I 'll be alright . I 'll be in in a while . If that crack about trust was meant for me , it 's misplaced . I trust you . I just wish that you had a little more faith in the Hawk ! You said yourself that Dad 's design was flawless , It 's just a long walk between the blueprints and the flight test , Jessie . There 's only one way to test a airplane and that 's one step at a time . I 've always handled the time-table before and now all of a sudden you want to speed it up ! Why ? I 'm only doing what Dad wants . Come on , Jess . If there was the slightest chance he knew or understood what kind of a hurry you 're in he 'd tell you the same thing : You do it by the book ! He understands ! And unlike you , he has confidence in my judgement . Another month , I 'll be through checking her out and you can do whatever you want with her . But until then , she 's mine . You 're having a problem with me , aren 't you ? Now that I 'm in charge , now that I 'm not just the boss ' daughter . What are you talking about ? Joe , whatever we are to each other , until this company gets on its feet , I 'm the boss . Accept that ? May I go now , boss ? Hey partner . I thought you were gonna hit the sack . Aren 't we going for a ride ? You asked your Dad ? Yeah , he said it was OK . There 's a helmet in the cab , why don 't you see if it fits ? This is terrific . How did you find this place ? I come here when I got a problem to work out , helps put things in perspective . Amazing , isn 't it ? Water in the middle of the dessert , comes out of a _ _ _ in the rocks upstream . I bet you know about everything , Cars , horses , planes , boats , You must be talking to Jessica , Yeah , I 've raced a few cars and boats but horses I just ride . Do it ! Do you ride on any kids , Joe ? No , I missed out on that one . Too bad . Your Dad seems like a real nice fella . Yeah , he 's nice . He 's just kind of unsual , that 's all . I haven 't seen him in a long time , Now it 's like he 's trying to make up for everything , Never did know a kid who didn 't think his folks had him on a too short a thread . It 'll work out . We better get in . Hey , do I have to wear this thing ? Don 't you ever get on a bike without it . A busted arm you can fix but you bust your head and you can wind up like poor old Conrad Bennett . What happened to him anyway ? He pushed himself too hard and popped the gas kit , had a stroke last January , Jessie 's been running the company ever since . Why does she talk to him like he 's still in charge ? Because he 's her Dad , to her he 's still the boss . And now she needs him more than never . Hold on . Hi , you couldn 't sleep either , huh ? I got up to look for Scott , I can 't find him . Joe 's truck is still here , he must have gone on for a ride . But don 't worry , Joe talks like a daredevil but underneath all that blast he 's really a little old lady . Believe me ! I know him better than you do . He 's gonna be fine . Your dress is ... it 's very thin . Does it bother you ? Bother me ? Should it ? It 's just that some men , I guess I 'm used to being treated like an old airplane or something . You must be a wonderful photographer . I bet you 've photographed lost of beautiful models . Probably . Were they prettier than me ? Well , the last one was a motorcycle . But you 're much prettier . Joe ? Wait ! Scott ? Look , it was only a bike ride , OK ? Sorry ! Good night ! Good night , Scott . This is amazing ! Not another plane under a hundred thousand that beats at it . The tail is in the front ! That 's why she won 't stall on you . Mr Conrad 's idea was to design a plane that was idiot-proof . This little wing upfront is what keeps you out of trouble . May I sit up here ? Sure ! Go ahead , climb on in . Right ! Put your feet down through there . Alrighty ! How does it feel ? I feel like a pilot ! There she is ! What do you think ? Is this hazy bright or ... open shade ? You got a great sense of humour ! I wish you 'd reconsider , I 'd be glad to pay you . In fact , I was thinking of hiring a photographer to get some publicity shots . Are you sure you can 't stay ? We have to keep moving . Your son sure seems to like Joe . If you 're jealous , join the club . He affects everybody that way . Jealous ? He can fly a plane better than anybody , and women fall all over him , now it looks like your son is falling under his spell too . Jealous ? Is this where you guys have been hiding ? Hang on , Scotty . Jess , can I talk to you for a minute ? If this personal or let 's leave it for later . Strictly business . OK . We 'll be right back . Excuse us . The car is all fixed . We can go now . Can we stay around with Joe for a couple of days ? I 'm sure nobody will find us here . Why do you wanna hang around here ? Joe 's a neat guy . You know , he 's a pilot and everything . I 'm a pilot ! Yeah , I guess you are . But Joe doesn 't have to stop and figure everything out all the time . He 's just a neat guy , that 's all . We 'll stop and get our bags at the guest house . I wanna say good-bye to Conrad Bennett . Oh ! I said I didn 't want any nuts ! Yes , no nuts . I 'm sorry . Hey , thanks . This is the man who was taking pictures of you yesterday , right ? He sure looks like him ! Only ... Only what ? Only he was wearing different clothes . This is the man , though ... Right ? Yeah , I think that 's him ! OK . Now you tell me what you told the policeman . Hmm . May I shouldn 't have said anything . I mean ... It 's pretty hard to believe I saw what I saw ! Even for me ! Hey ! Then just tell what you remember . OK . Well , Sir , There must have been some oil on the road , because my bike just slid out , and then I see this truck coming , and I looked around me and all of a sudden the guy with the camera , he was ... The guy with the camera was what ? Well , I was just wondering . Could you spoon this to me ? I mean , Maybe I 'm left-handed and all , Yes . Hey , thanks . I came to say good-bye . Sam ? Jessie Bennett ! Sam , I just talked to my test pilot and he says we 're gonna need another three weeks . Yeah , I know it 's not what we agreed on , but it just isn 't impossible . Three weeks . A month on the outside . Sam ! Sam ? Please . No-one 's ever gone broke back in the Bennett design before , and there 's no reason to start now . I 'm sorry . I thought you 'd gone ! Did you change your mind ? I have to tell you something . I 've been talking with your father , about the Hawk . You 've been talking to my father ? Yes . He 's been thinking about the design , He says he made a mistake . Look ! My father doesn 't talk to anyone , he hasn 't said a word since the stroke ! You talk to him ! I 'm his daughter ! I 've known him all my life , I don 't need words to talk to him ! I can sense what he 's feeling . So can I. - And he told me ... - Wait a minute ! He didn 't tell you anything ! Jessica , don 't you believe any longer that your father ... Of course I do ! But he can 't talk with words ! Certainly he can ... Listen , I don 't like jokes of this kind . No joke , Jessica , 20 minutes ago you father told me ... Stop it ! My father had a stroke ! He can 't walk ! He can 't move ! There 's nothig left of him , nothing but an emtly sh ... Please , will you get out of here ? You have to know . Just get out of here , OK ? All ready ? I have to tell you something . It 's very important . If it 's about Jessica , I 'm not interested . It 's not about her , it 's about the Hawk . Look , Mister ... Jessie 's a big girl , she can run her life however she wants to , But I run the operations in this hangar , and I don 't need any advice about this airplane . Now get out of here . The canard is mounted too far forward . Say what ? Conrad Bennett made a mistake in his calculations . I thought you said you didn 't know anything about airplanes . A little . and the canard is ... too far forward ? Right . Well , show me ! Just how far ? You don 't even know where the damn thing is , do you ? Well , this is the canard , Mister , Right where Conrad Bennett wanted it . Now , I 'm telling you , I want you out of here . Dad ? If you can hear me ... You know I 'm only doing what I have to do . Wish me luck ! I know how tough things have been , Joe , I don 't know what I would have done without you . Anything for Bennett Aviation . Will you do a favour for Conrad Bennett 's daughter ? There was a time you didn 't need to ask . Is that a yes ? Yeah . The Sheriff wants to talk to me about that little incident on the highway , Your unscheduled landing ? Would you mind going into town and see if you can straighten it out for me ? It won 't take long . Sure ! Look , Jess , about ... The Sheriff was real upset when he called . OK . I 'll take care of it right away . You 're a hard man to say good-bye to , Mr Forrester . I don 't wanna say good-bye to you either . Look , I thougt I made it clear , We fed you , bunked you and fixed your car . There 's nothing else . Your father ... Stop it ! Just get out of here . Or do I have to have you thrown out ? Be careful . Sheriff ? Sorry to bother you but Jessica said you wanted to talk to her about that emergency landing out on the highway _ _ _ _ out there seems to know anything about it . We got no beef with her . She might have a problem with the FAA . She sent me down here before . She 's been a little rattled since that photographer showed up . Thanks , Ted . I 'll see you later . Sheriff ? I 'm George Fox , I 'm with the Federal Security Agency , I called you earlier ? How can we help you ? Mister Fox ? Who was that ? Almost five , Joe . I 'll go along with that . What can I do for you , Sam ? Everybody 's here . That 's my people , right there by the runway . Those are you people ? Loan comittee . Jessica talked me into bringing them out here , see the plane fly . There 's been some kind of screw-up . You mean there 's no demo flight ? I 'm afraid not , Sam , in a couple of weeks maybe but not today . We haven 't even started the taxi test yet . Sorry to hear about that , Joe . The note 's gonna be called on Monday . You can get us an extension , can 't you ? We need about another 30 days . This was the extension . What ? I 'm sorry , Joe . I 've held everybody out just about as long as I can . I have no idea , I don 't know why she didn 't tell me . Jessica ! Jessie , no ! Oh my God ! Jessie , stop ! Eight Six Bravo this is Joe Floss , Jessie do you read me ? Jessie , she 's not ready ! Bring her down ! Jessie , what kind of a bonehead stunt are you pulling up there ? Rosemont tower , this Bennett Eight Six Bravo , request permission to bust the field . Negative , Eight Six Bravo , you do not have clearance . Transmission seems to be breaking up . Eight Six Bravo , we copy ? Understand we have clearance . Jessica , do you read me ? Come on baby ! Talk to me ! ( Indistinctive ) Come on , kitten ! Let 's not act up . Come on ! Don 't die out . Jessi ! What are you crazy ? What did you bring him down here for ? Jessica is in trouble . I know that ! You get out of here , I got enough on my hands ! Listen to him ! You may know a lot but you don 't know everything . My Dad says Mr Bennett talks to him and it 's the truth ! Joe ? Joe , she 's not responding . I don 't know what 's going on . I can 't get it stabilized . I 'm not sure if I can land it ! Joe ? Do you read me ? We 're here baby . Now , don 't panic . Just try to feel the ship , she 'll tell you what she needs . What are you doing ? Tell her to add power and land it hot , she 'll be able to control it . This is nuts . He says the canard is mounted too far forward of the main spar . The plane is aerodynamically unbalanced . Listen to him . Jessie ? This is joe , Joe ? I can 't hang on to it ! Add power , Jessie Move the throttle all the way to the wall . Jessie ! Do you read me ? Add power ! Joe , are you sure ? Do as I say and keep it humming , make a straight end approach ! Don 't cut power til you 're on the ground . Yahooo , yahaaaa ! What was that blue thing ? It 's kind of like a Swiss Army knife . And you can talk to him . Yes . Can you tell him Jessie 's OK and not to worry ? He knows . Who the hell are you , Mister ? A pilot . What are you trying to do ? Kill yourself ? Your are a crazy lady ! I 'm glad to see you too ! Yeah , you can read me out later but right now the important thing is we did it ! But we didn 't ! What are you talking about ? Your Dad 's in the office with Paul Forrester , I don 't understand it , Jess but somehow he can read his thoughts . What 's gotten into you , Joe ? I got myself into trouble up there and you got me out of it . Damn it , Jessica , listen to me , It wasn 't me ! It was your father and Paul Forrester ! What 's the meaning of this ? Why was he brought here ? To save you and your plane . He 's right . The test pilot is always right . That 's what keeps him alive . He does understand , doesn 't he ? He hears you and he understands . I thought I lost him . Now you 've given him back to me ! Oh ! I ... don 't think you should do that ! Joe could get jealous ! What ? Me jealous ? Are you kidding ? Believe him ! The only thing a test pilot will get jealous of is a hotter airplane ! Hey , are you boys in trouble with the law ? Why ? Better take a look . Pardon me ! Gentlemen ! Pay attention ! May I have your attention for a moment ? I 'm looking for this man . Has anyone seen him around here at all ? Alright ! Settle down everybody ! Keep it down , please keep it down . Are you Jessica Bennett ? Yes ! I 'm with the Federal Security Agency . and I understand you have a photograhper named Paul Forrester working here ? Sorry . I 've never seen him before . What about you ? I don 't recognize him . Sure , he 's an ugly guy , isn 't he ? Well ... We made it ! Barely ! What do yo mean ? I thought I did good ! The only thing you did good was to keep your helmet on ! Motorcycle riding is not like rodeo riding ! Rodeo ? Forget it ! We should have kept the car !

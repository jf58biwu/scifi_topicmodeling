 ( " STAR WARS " - STYLE MUSIC ) ( RED DWARF THEME ) - Cat ? - Mmm ? - You ever see " The Flintstones " ? - Sure . Do you think Wilma 's sexy ? Wilma Flintstone ? Maybe we 've been in deep space too long , but every time I see that show , she drives me crazy . - Is it me ? - Well , I think , in all probability , Wilma Flintstone is the most desirable woman who ever lived . That 's good . I thought I was going strange . - She 's incredible . - What do you think of Betty ? Betty Rubble ? Well , I would go with Betty ... but I 'd be thinking of Wilma . This is crazy . We 're talking about going to bed with Wilma Flintstone . You 're right . We 're nuts . This is an insane conversation . She 'll never leave Fred , and we know it . Holly , clipboard and pen , please . - Well , Krytie , today 's the day . - But , sir , I 'm just not ready . - Six weeks is just not long enough . - Ten-thirty . Name ? - You know my name . - If this works , it 's a new lease of life for us , but we 've got to do it by the book . It 's just when you go into " official mode " , my anxiety chip goes into overdrive . - Name ? - K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K ... K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K ... I 'll just put Kryten . - Can you see that space vehicle ? - Where ? Oh , that one . Yes , sir . And can you read the registration for me , please ? - Starbug 1 ? - Right , show me to your vehicle . Right , in your own time , start the space vehicle , proceed through the cargo bay doors and off into outer space . Once through the doors , proceed directly to the nearest planet . Once there , bring the vehicle to a halt and then carefully reverse into the planet 's orbit , remembering to pay due care and attention to any other space users . Right , in your own time . ( CLUNK AND WHOOSH ) In your own time . I 've failed , haven 't I ? - Just proceed . - You 'll hold it against me . - One mistake . - Please . ( KRYTEN ) Antigrav , check . Retro , check . Boosters , check . And very gently ease forward ... I think there 's something wrong with the gearbox . The thing is , I learned to drive in Starbug 2 . I 'm not used to the controls in Starbug 1 . - They 're exactly the same . - Yes . That 's the problem . ( BRAKES SCREECH ) Next , transfer to autopilot , while we conduct the recognition ... ( GEARS GRIND ) - .. tests . - Engage autopilot . Autopilot engaged . Well , I say " autopilot " . It 's not really . It 's Muggins here who has to do it . - Right , what 's that one ? - Heavy traffic . Keep in lane . - That one ? - Danger . Space mirages ahead . At half the speed of light , what is the stopping distance ? - Four years , three months . - And the thinking time ? A fortnight . - Space phenomena . What 's that ? - A pulsar . - And that ? - A binary star . - What 's that ? - A time hole ! - Don 't help him . - It 's a time hole ! - It 's nothing like a time hole . - ( HOLLY ) It is . - It is ! It 's a time hole ! - A time hole is a rare phenomenon , which , legend has it , transports us into another part of space and time . That is obviously a blue giant about to go supernova . THAT is a time hole . Right , what 's this ? ( TREMENDOUS CRASH ) I suppose you 're going to fail me for this . What is this place ? Holly ? Is it possible ? Can this be Earth ? Certainly seems that way . Constellations match . Gravity , one G. - What 's the time period ? - Well , difficult to say exactly , but according to all available data , I would estimate it 's round about lunchtime , maybe half-one . What period in history , dingleberry-breath ? Can we expect to see Genghis Khan and his barbarian buddies sweeping across the hill ? Or flesh-eating dinosaurs eating Doug McClure ? What is the year ? Well , I 'd need more data before I could give a precise answer . - Like ? - This year 's calendar would be handy . ( KRYTEN ) I 've never been to Earth . I 've only seen it on photographs . It 's exactly like I always imagined , only much shorter . " Nodnol , 871 selim . " - Nodnol ? Where 's Nodnol ? - ( KRYTEN ) It 's London . " London , 178 miles . " It 's backwards . - Shh ! A truck . - It 'll probably hit that box . There 's a perfectly rational explanation for this . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) Then again , possibly not . ( HORNS HONK ) ( RIMMER ) What the smeg is going on ? ( KRYTEN ) Everything 's backwards . ( HOLLY ) It 's perfectly consistent with current theory . Everything starts with a Big Bang , right ? And the universe starts expanding . When it 's expanded as far as it can , there 's the Big Crunch , and everything starts contracting . It 's possible that time starts running backwards , as well . ( RIMMER ) So is this Earth ? ( HOLLY ) It 's Earth all right , only Earth where time 's going backwards . ( BOTH SPEAK BACKWARDS ) ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) Flobba-dob blib blob bleeb . - What are you doing ? - You said look inconspicuous . - Don 't be idiotic . - But if people see my face , what will they think ? Tell them you took your car to the crushers and forgot to get out . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) - I got a newspaper . - What 's the year ? 3991 ? ! No , it 's 1993 . It 's backwards . I 'll switch to reverse mode . ( BLEEPS ) " Three brought to life in bank raid . " A masked man with a sawn-off shotgun sucked bullets " out of two cashiers and a security guard " in a South London bank tomorrow . " The armed raider then forced terrified staff to accept Â£ 10,000 , " which he demanded they place in the bank 's vaults . " The man , Michael Ellis , completed a 15-year prison sentence " for the crime two years ago . " - What does that say ? - It 's an advert . " Roll-off deodorant . Keeps you wet and smelly for up to 24 hours . " What shall we do ? This place is crazy . There 's nothing we can do until they find us . We 'd better get a job . What jobs are there in a backwards reality for a dead hologram and an android with a head like a novelty condom ? Here 's the jobs page . This looks interesting . " Wanted - managing director , ICI . Excellent demotion prospects . " Right candidate could go straight to the bottom . " - Something a bit more low-key . - " Restaurant requires dish dirtier " ? - Anything else ? - Ah , this looks interesting . " Theatrical agent requires novelty acts . " - What do we do that 's a novelty ? - In this world , everything . - Three weeks we been doing this . - We 'll do it till we find them . We ain 't gonna find ' em . They 're gone , buddy . But look on the bright side ... they 're gone , buddy ! Don 't you care about anyone but yourself ? Hell , no . I don 't even care about you . If Goalpost-Head and Freak-Face want to get lost , that 's their bag . I don 't see why it should cut into my preening time . You realise with all this , I haven 't permed my leg hairs in a week ? - I 'm a wreck . - You perm your leg hairs ? Only as an aid to the natural curl . - Fasten your belt . - I don 't need fashion tips from you . SAFETY belt . Look . Is that what I think it is ? - What do you think it is ? - An orange whirly thing . It 's a time hole . That 's where they are . We 're going in . - What ? ! You can 't go in there . - Why not ? Orange with this suit ? ! Where are we ? I don 't believe this . According to the NaviComp , this is Earth . ( LISTER ) Engage cloak . I 'm takin ' her down . - ( CAT ) What was that for ? - We don 't want to freak the natives . ( METALLIC CLUNK ) Hey . What 's the matter ? I dunno . I think me ribs are cracked . And me back . - Is my eye bruised ? - Yeah , it is . - What 's that ? - It 's a homing device . It 'll find their flight recorder . Yonder . I 'm home . - You found anything ? - The Bug 's there , but they 're not . You 're dry . That 's weird . Let 's take a look around . Maybe they left us a clue or something . ( LISTER ) What 's this ? They must have left them to tell us where they 'll be . - What 's it say ? - It 's in some weird language . " Srehtorb . " That must be Polish or Bulgarian or somethin ' . - You speak Bulgarian ? - Me ? ! I can hardly speak English . What 's this ? Nodnol ? Hang on ! Wait a minute ! Nodnol . Nod-nol . - It 's in Bulgaria . - Are you sure ? Geography was my number-one subject at school . Nodnol - rich in animal produce and minerals , just south of Bosnia . - What 's " selim " ? - Obviously , Bulgarian for kilometres . You 're so smart . I 'm glad I 'm with you . Well , we are the smart party . ( BOTH MAKE BEATBOX SOUNDS ) ( RAPS ) I didn 't come here lookin ' for trouble I just came to do the Red Dwarf shuffle ! ( CAT ) He 's smart ( BOTH ) He 's smart ( LISTER ) My ribs are killing me . Let 's find some transport . Come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! Come on ! Bye , suckers ! You lost your bike ! Start pedalling , man ! Start pedalling ! - Get this thing in forward gear ! - It IS in forward gear ! Stop ! Stop ! No more . I 'm not moving another yard on this thing . I 've got a parting in the back of my head . It 's these cheap Bulgarian bikes . You probably have to queue for a year for this junk . You have to be a government official to get one that goes forwards . Yo , matey . Excuse me . Excuse me . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) I don 't speak Bulgarian . You speak English ? We 're lookin ' for our friend . Erm ... friendski . Uh ... Our budski ? Palski ? There 's an addresski hereski . Can you , erm ... drop us offski ? - Rock 'n'roll . - Thankski verski muchski , budski . ( CAT ) HeyI HeyI HeyI We 're movin ' in the right direction now . ( DOG BARKS BACKWARDS ) This is the place . My eye ! Me back feels like it 's been cut to ribbons ! Moan , moan , moan , moan , moan ! Ladies and gentlemen , olleh , olleh , olleh . Welcome to the show . ( ROARS OF LAUGHTER ) - That 's a joke ? - For our first trick tonight , my partner Kryten will attempt to eat a boiled egg ... - forwards . - ( ALL GASP ) ( CRIES OF DISGUST AND AMUSEMENT ) This is entertainment to these people ? It 's pathetic . They 're Bulgarian . They have very simple tastes . I have it . It 's a moron convention . Check the coat room . If there are 20 jackets , all white , with arms that tie behind the neck , I 'm right . And what better way to round off a meal than by drinking a glass of water ? - Kryten . - Whoa , stick around . They 're building up to a big climax . We are the Sensational Reverse Brothers . We shall see you last night . ( APPLAUSE AND CHEERING ) Let 's get a drink and go backstage . Hello ? Excuse me ? Can I have two pints of bitter , please ? - Bitter . Two pints . - She can 't understand you . - You 're wasting your time . - Yo , what you drinkin ' there ? Drinkski ? Beerski ? Ah , rettib . Two pints of rettib , please . - Rettib ? - Two . Was that difficult ? No , we 're the smart party . Rettib . Rettib . ( BACKWARDS SLURPING ) ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) This isn 't Bulgaria . Look at that menu . " Unem . " It 's English , but backwards . Everything 's backwards . - Everything 's backwards ? - Yeah . Right ! Well , as they say , when in Rome , do as the Snamor do . - Up the hatch . - Booties down . What do you mean , you don 't want to leave ? ! - We 're happy . - We 've found a niche . We 're the Sensational Reverse Brothers . After just three weeks , we 're a hit . - Rimmer , everything is backwards . - We 've got used to it . Once you get over the initial shock , things actually make a lot more sense . There 's no death here . You start off dead , you have a funeral , then come to life . As each year passes , you get younger , until you become a newborn baby . Then you go back inside your mother , who goes back inside her mother , and so on , until eventually we all become one glorious whole . Rimmer , you already are one glorious hole . - You 've totally flipped , man . - We want to stay . But we can 't stay . Look , I 'm 25 now . In 10 years ' time , I 'll be 15 . I 'll have to go through puberty again . Backwards . Imagine that . Your gajimbas will suddenly rise back into your body , and next thing you know , you 're singing soprano in the choir . And worse than that , in 25 years , I 'll be a little sperm , swimming around in somebody 's testicles . That 's just not how I saw my future . I tell you , things are better here . It 's our universe that 's backwards . Take war . War is a wonderful thing here . In 50 years ' time , the Second World War will start ... backwards . - That 's a good thing ? - Millions will come to life . Hitler will retreat across Europe , liberate France and Poland , disband the Third Reich and bog off back to Austria . We 're smash hits . We 'd be crazy to leave . Rimmer , we don 't belong here . This place is crazy . Crazy ? Death , disease , famine - there 's none of that here . There 's no crime . Our first night here , a mugger jumped us and forced Â£ 50 into my wallet at knifepoint . OK , OK . But look at the flipside of the coin . It 's not all good . Take someone like , say , St Francis of Assisi . In this universe , he 's the petty-minded little sadist who goes around maiming small animals . Or Santa Claus - what a bastard ! - Eh ? - He 's the fat git who sneaks down chimneys and steals all the kids ' favourite toys . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) What fight ? We didn 't start any fight ? - What 's he saying ? - ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) ( KNOCKING ) - We 're fired ! For fighting . - You 've been with us all night . He says we 'll never work the pub circuit again . For smeg 's sake ! Be reasonable ! ( BACKWARDS CONVERSATION ) Tell him about the contract thing . He can 't just sack us like that . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) - What 's that about ? - Rimmer in a fight ? That 's a laugh . - So , what 's the plan ? - I dunno . If they don 't change their minds , head back without them . My back ! We just gotta get out of here . This universe is just too disgusting . ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) - What 's the matter with him ? - ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) I think we 've just uneaten his pie . Unbelievable . We didn 't start a fight . Look , I 'm sorry , man . We were just ... Ah ! - ( CAT ) Are you OK ? - My black eye 's gone ! He just sucked it off me face with his fist ! Oh ! - Now he 's uncracked me ribs ! - We don 't want any trouble . You don 't understand . All this mess , all this debris , is from the fight we got fired for , which we 're about to have . ABOUT to have ? I don 't want a bar room brawl . It 's not a bar room brawl . It 's a bar room tidy . Unrumble ! - Where are you going ? - I know what happens to me back . Here , have your tooth back . ( BACKWARDS CHATTER ) Good one , gentlemen . Thanks for your support . Let 's go . I 've forgotten something . - ( SPEAKS BACKWARDS ) - What the hell ? It 's a good cause . How much is that , mate ? Oh , aye , yeah ! ( CABBIE ) Oi ! Tight git . You know , it could have worked . It really could . Where 's the Cat ? He won 't be long . He 's ... you know ... in the bushes . We 've got to stop him . Don 't ask ! # It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

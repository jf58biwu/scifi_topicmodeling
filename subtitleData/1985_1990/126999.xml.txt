 What am I working on ? Something that will change the world ... ... and human life as we know it . Change it a lot or just a bit ? Be more specific . You want me to be more specific here with ... ... half the scientific community eavesdropping ? Where else ? You could come back to my lab . I 'll make cappuccino . I have a Faema of my own . It 's not the dilettante 's plastic model . It 's a restaurant espresso machine with an eagle on top . Somehow I get the feeling you don 't get out much . - You can tell that ? - Yes . You 're making a mistake . I think you really want to talk to me . Sorry . I have three other interviews before this party is over . But they don 't have something that will change the world . They say they do . Yeah but they 're lying . I 'm not . Are you sick ? No- - Sure . You 're not a very good drunk . No , I 'm always like this . It 's the ... ... motion sickness . When I was a kid , I puked on my tricycle . I hate vehicles . Should I drive slowly ? No . Turn left . We 're almost there . This is it ? It 's cleaner on the inside . Please . Listen . Maybe this is a bad idea . Too late . You 've already seen them . You can 't leave here alive . I haven 't seen anything . Those . Designer phone booths . Very cute . I bet you have a really neat jukebox in here too . Over there ? No . No . This is the ... ... prototype of those . The first one I had made . It works , but it 's clunky . I call them telepods . They 're controlled by this . Thank God for that . So , what do they do ? The phones booths ? Telepods . Okay , I need an object . Um . Do you have something that is ... ... personal I can use ? Something uniquely you ? An item of clothing or jewelry ? You kidding ? No , I 'm serious . Okay . Here it goes . Mm-hm . - I don 't wear jewelry . - Mm-hm . It 's nice . Brundle , Seth . ( BRUNDLE WHISPERS ) Watch the stocking . Well ? Great . A giant microwave oven . I 'm glad I didn 't give you my Rolex . If I had a Rolex . You 're missing the point . Look . Teleportation ? Please . Wait a minute . Is that a hologram ? - Where 's my stocking ? - That 's it . Pick it up . I don 't get it . What happened ? You get it but you can 't handle it . Your stocking has just been teleported ... ... from one pod to another . Disintegrated there and reintegrated there . Sort of . It will change the world as we know it , right ? Oh , no . This is incredible . It 's not possible , is it ? How have you kept this quiet ? Please sit down . How could you do this alone ? I don 't work alone . There 's stuff in there I don 't understand . I 'm really a ... ... systems manager . I farm out ... ... pieces to men more brilliant than I . I say : " Design me a molecular analyzer , " and they do . I just assemble it . None of them knows what the project really is . And the money ? Bartok Science lndustries financed this ? But they leave me alone because I 'm not expensive . They know they 'll own whatever it is . You haven 't told them ? When I 'm ready . ( TAPE RECORDER BEEPS ) Wait a second . What 's that ? To get the quotes right . Quotes ? No . This was personal . Don 't write about it . What do you mean ? I 'm a journalist . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - You knew that . I made a mistake . I shouldn 't have shown you this . I 'm very sorry . Particle Magazine sent me to get a story . This is the most exciting story ever . No . Absolutely not . I must have that tape . - Please . - You can 't do that . Don 't write a story . I 'd never have told this stuff to a journalist . - But you told it to me . - I suppose I did but- - - Sure did . - Now wait a minute . Come here . What about your stocking ? Keep it for good luck . BRUNDLE : I say : " Design me a molecular analyzer , " and they do . Ijust assemble it . None of them knows what the project really is . VERONICA : And the money ? Bartok Science lndustries financed this ? BRUNDLE : But they leave me alone because I 'm not expensive . They know they 'll own whatever it is . Well , that 's it . What do you think ? It 's a joke . What ? He 's conning you . It 's an old nightclub routine . The two cabinets . You fell for it . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Wait . That was no- - - Are we having lunch ? That was no nightclub routine . I was there . I saw it . Yeah ? Sure . Send him in . You must have made an impression . What do you mean ? Your magician followed you here . I 'm Stathis Borans , editor of Particle Magazine . - Seth Brundle . - I know who you are . Listen ... ... why don 't you two use my office ? I 've gotta run . If you plan to make anything disappear , let me know . I have an assistant editor who 's outlived his usefulness . You didn 't waste time . I 'm not getting any younger . He wasn 't impressed by your tape ? He thinks you 're a con man . Excellent . Yeah ? Well , let 's see what the people at Omni think about it . No , no . Listen , Veronica ... . I 've come here to say one magic word . Yeah ? Cheeseburger . I 've been working alone too long . I have a strong urge to talk about what I 'm doing . But if this gets out now ... ... Veronica , it 'll kill me . The Bartok people and my colleagues will kill me . It 's not ready yet . It works okay . No , something important 's missing . Yeah ? Yeah . What ? I can only teleport inanimate objects . What happens when you teleport living things ? Not while we 're eating . Can 't be worse than this . You 're not doing a good job of convincing me . I think I should tell the world about this now . You should tell it ... ... but not yet . What do you have so far ? Enough to make you nervous . Why not get more ? Make me your major project , a book . Not a magazine article . Follow me and my work , day by day in detail . I have no life , so there 's nothing for you to interfere with . Research the background . Cover the process . " The complete record of the most earth-shattering invention ever . The one that ended all concepts of transport ... ... of borders and frontiers , of time and space . " The book will end with me ... ... transporting myself from one telepod to another . That 's what 's missing . Wait for me that long ? ( SHOWER RUNNING ) What are you doing here ? STATHIS : I was in the neighborhood . Felt a bit scummy . Rough day . ( FLUSHES TOILET ) ( STATHIS YELLS ) How 'd you get in ? I have a key , remember ? You gave it to me . I should 've changed the lock . You didn 't . - Yeah ? - Yeah . That 's because unconsciously ... ... you still want me to come back , move in again . No . That 's because , consciously , I 'm lazy and disorganized . Your new playmate 's interesting . What playmate ? The nightclub act . Brundle . - Yeah ? - Yeah . I was wrong . He 's really quite brilliant . He led the F32 team . Remember that ? An inch away from the Nobel Prize for physics . He was only 20 at the time . I 'm not going to do Brundle . Maybe the Psychology Today gig . That 's not like you . Are you getting out or am I ? I 'll go . Shall I return later and tuck you in ? No . Key . I 'll keep it ... ... for old time 's sake . You 're a petty schmuck . Initiate in 5 seconds . ( SQUEALS ) I 've got to do this , Seth . Talk to the tape . Get in the habit . The world will want to know what you 're thinking . " Fuck " is what I 'm thinking ! Good . The world will want to know that . What else ? Why didn 't it work ? I think it turned the baboon inside out . Why ? It can 't deal with the flesh , only inanimate objects . It must be my fault . Why ? Computers only know what you tell them . I don 't know enough about the flesh . I have to learn . I don 't want to talk now . Do you ever change your clothes ? What ? You 're always wearing the same clothes . No , these are clean . I change my clothes every day . Five sets of exactly the same clothes ? Learned it from Einstein . This way I don 't have to ... ... expend any thought on what to wear . I grab the next set on the rack . I bought some steaks . Can I make you one ? We could go out . Cheeseburger ? No , we don 't have to go there . You 're very cute . You know that ? Am I ? ( KISSING ) Ew . Ow . - What happened ? - On my back . Ow . Oh , God , something 's stuck to your back . Pull it off . VERONICA : Oh , ew . BRUNDLE : Ow . Sorry . I wondered where this was . - Do you have any disinfectant ? - No , that 's okay . I 'll kiss it for you . Sorry . I just want to eat you up . That 's why old ladies pinch babies ' cheeks . It 's the flesh . It makes you crazy . Ronnie . Ronnie . You want to try an experiment ? Sure . Eat this . I need an objective opinion . - Yes ? - Well ... ... it could use some finesse , but it tastes like a steak . BRUNDLE : Okay . Now try this teleported half . - A monkey just came apart in there . - Baboon . Eat . It tastes funny . - Funny how ? - It tastes ... ... synthetic. Mm-hm . What have we proved ? The computer is giving us its interpretation ... ... of a steak . It 's translating it , rethinking it ... ... rather than reproducing it . Something gets lost in the translation . Me . I 'm lost . The flesh . It should make the computer crazy . Like old ladies pinching babies . But it doesn 't yet . I haven 't taught the computer to be made crazy by the flesh . The poetry of the steak . So I 'll teach it now . I knew it . What are you doing here ? I followed you . Psychology Today , my ass . You stayed with Brundle all night . Why didn 't I believe you ? I think he 'd look great in this . Don 't you ? For your Time Magazine cover , you have to look good , right ? Don 't you get it ? I am finally onto something big . - Huge . - Yeah ? What ? His cock ? Crude , Stathis . Very crude . You 're too perfect . You 're a goddess . Thanks for making my paranoid fantasies come true . I don 't have to report to you , you creep . Ronnie ? You have to talk to me . No , I don 't ! We 're finished . I 'll spend the night anywhere I damn well please . Sorry . I 'll take this too . I think it 's time for champagne . VERONICA : Oh , God , Seth . It really happened . You did it ! - You 'll never be carsick again . - Or airsick or seasick . I know . Or tricycle-sick . What 's next ? Send the baboon out for tests , see if he 's okay . How long will that take ? Could be weeks . Really ? Yeah , why ? Well , I was thinking that we could take a holiday . We could ? Yeah . Like an old married couple . Old man 's got a couple weeks off , so ... ... they go to Florida , someplace warm . Just you and me ? Is there someone else you want to bring along ? No , no , I just ... . Is this a romance we 're having ? Yeah . Could be a romance . Come here . I have a great idea . You like Chinese food ? Yes . We 'll have a romantic dinner here . What 's this ? From your editor . It was under the door . Victor , it 's Seth Brundle . Yeah , I 'll wait . BRUNDLE : What 's that ? ( VERONICA SIGHS ) Nothing . It 's just personal bullshit . Old married couples share everything to stay old and married . - Listen , Seth , don 't rush it . - What are you talking about ? I have to go out for a few hours . Now ? No , Ronnie , spicy eggplant , champagne . Just a few hours . I have the residue of another life . I have to scrape it off my shoe and get rid of it , once and for all . Hi . ( DOOR CLOSES ) VERONICA : What 's this supposed to mean ? I 'm your editor and I 'm shaping your material into a story . You told me there was no story . You said Brundle was a con man . I 've decided to trust your journalistic instincts . Thanks very much . But this is not your story . It 's mine . Says who ? I sent you to the Bartok party to see what you could find . Your discovery is my discovery . I have a lot of background on Brundle . He 's worked on this for six years . There 's material to find if you dig deep . - I dug . - Stathis ... . All transportation is going to become obsolete . And I 'm in the middle of it . - The only inside recorder of the event . - Okay . Okay . Look , just keep me informed . All right ? As a friend ? As a professional confidante ? That 's all ? I don 't want you to disappear from my life . Okay . What about sex ? I 'm not saying love or affection . Just stress-relieving sex . You and me . You 're disgusting . As always . Couldn 't disappoint you . Residue means your old boyfriend , doesn 't it ? Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend . " From the desk of Stathis Borans . " How about , " Under the desk of Stathis Borans " ? She works for her old boyfriend and runs out late at night to see him . Is this the Ronnie game ? I 'm catching on . I 'm catching on . I didn 't mean to kill your brother , but he didn 't die in vain . ( FLY BUZZES ) I wouldn 't ask you to do anything that I wouldn 't do myself . You 're all right . I can tell you 're okay . What are we waiting for ? Let 's do it . ( CHATTERS ) ( FLY BUZZES ) How you doing ? Now , you tell me . Am I different somehow ? " Is it live or is it Memorex ? " It 's too bad Ronnie missed it . I missed you last night . It 's still night . I came back . You had to celebrate without me . I 'm sorry . I went through last night . You went through ? Without testing the baboon ? I was drunk . I was a bit upset . You could 've killed yourself . Are you sleeping with Stathis ? What are you talking about ? I don 't know . I just get that feeling . That 's why you were upset ? I got jealous . Oh , God . Seth , you don 't have to be jealous . He 's an old boyfriend . He taught college . I was a science major . He got me started in journalism . Does he love you ? How could he not ? You went through and I wasn 't there . I taped it for you . You did ? ( FLY BUZZES ) ( FLY BUZZES ) ( BUZZING STOPS ) I asked the computer if it improved me , but it didn 't understand . That made me think about what I 'm feeling and why . I 'm thinking ... ... that process of being taken apart atom by atom and reassembled- - It 's like filtering coffee . It 's a purifying process . It 's cleansed me . I think it 's going to allow me to realize ... ... the personal potential I 've been neglecting all these years ... ... that I 've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal . - Do you take coffee with your sugar ? - What ? I 've never given me a chance to be me . Interestingly , when I achieved ... ... what will prove to be my life 's work ... ... I 've become the real me , finally . So , listen ... ... not to wax Messianic ... ... but the synchronicity of the two events may blur the individual effect . But it is , nevertheless , also certainly true . I will say now , however subjectively , human teleportation ... ... molecular breakdown and reformation is inherently purging . It makes a man a king . Since I left the pod , I feel great . I think I will have a cannoli after all . Waiter ! What an accomplishment . But what have I really done ? I 've said to the world : " Let 's go . Move . Catch me if you can . " Waiter . Jesus Christ ! ( MOANING ) VERONICA : Oh , God . Wait . VERONICA : Oh , God . What ? How can you keep going ? You can 't have any fluid left in your body . We 've been doing this for hours . I 'm not ready to quit yet . Come on . Hey . What 's this ? It 's an attempt to distract me . Really , what is it ? It 's like ... - ... hairs or something . - I don 't know , it 's ... . It happens when you get older , weird hair . They 're really coarse . I 've never been hairy enough . Know what I mean ? Always too boyish . I look forward to a hairy body . It 's one of the compensations of old age . Where are you going ? Not my new hairs . What are you doing ? Relax . You don 't want a body covered with these . God ! They 're really tough ! Listen . I want you to go through . I want to teleport you right now . I hardly need to sleep and I feel wonderful . It 's like a pure , benign drug . The power I feel surging inside me- - ! We 'll be the perfect couple . The dynamic duo . Come on . - Right now . - Hey , wait . Don 't give me that born-again teleportation . I 'm scared . What do I have to say ? I 'm not gonna do it ! You 're a fucking drag , you know ? Something went wrong . When you went through , something went wrong . No ? Not you ? If you 're too chickenshit to be in the dynamic duo club ... ... I 'll find somebody else who can keep up with me . Listen to me- - You 're afraid to dive in the plasma pool . You 're afraid to be destroyed and re-created . Think you woke me up about the flesh ? You only know society 's straight line about the flesh . You can 't penetrate society 's sick gray fear of the flesh . Drink deep , or taste not the plasma spring . See what I 'm saying ? This is not just sex and penetration , but penetration ... ... beyond the veil of the flesh . A deep , penetrating dive into the plasma pool . I 'll have a scotch . Who 's winning ? I don 't know . I hope it 's Marky . - How come ? - Because . I like Marky tonight . I like you tonight . Maybe I 'd better get involved . Hey , pal , you 're disturbing us . $ 1 00 says I can beat either of you . Take a hike , asshole . Here . Here 's my hundred . I get to take her home if I win . Says who ? Do I look like a hooker ? Tawny , it 's an easy hundred . Let 's get it over with . - Watch out . He eats chocolate bars . - So I noticed . TAWNY : Are you a bodybuilder ? BRUNDLE : I build bodies . I take them apart and put them back together . TAWNY : Well , you sure took Marky apart . - Let 's go to my place . - Your place ? Well , okay . I live with my mother anyway . But could we go to a few more bars first ? - It 's too early to quit . - Sure , a few more bars . Great place . There 's no elevator . - I can 't make it . - There 's an elevator . There , don 't you feel elevated ? Whoa . Wow . Are you a magician ? Yes . So , are we going to breakfast or not ? It 's your turn . - To do what ? - To go through . No . I don 't want to try that . It 'll make you feel sexy . I already feel sexy . How about ... ... a nice ... - ... alcohol rub ? - Don 't do that ! It hurts . Sorry , hon . I didn 't know you had the skin of a princess . - You 're sensitive . - Okay ! That 's it . You 're going to like it . - I don 't want to . I 'm afraid . - Don 't be afraid . No . Be afraid . Be very afraid . Who 's this ? Oh , I live with my mother too . Mom , meet Tawny . I gotta go . Thanks for a wonderful time . Why 'd you scare her off ? Jealous ? You 're changing . Everything about you is changing . You look bad . You smell bad . I 've never bathed much . Those weird hairs that grew out of your back , I took them to a lab . I had them analyzed . The hairs ? The hairs ? Oh , yeah . That 's a strange thing to do . Not as strange as the results . The guy had trouble identifying them . He finally concluded that they were definitely not human . - Very good . - Not human , Seth . In fact , very likely insect hairs . That 's ridiculous . Look . There 's more . Look at your face . Something happened . You need help . You must be sick . You 're jealous ! I 've become free and you can 't stand it . You 'll do anything to bring me down . Does this look like a sick man to you ? No , stop it ! Can a sick man do that ? The deal is off . I don 't need you anymore . Seth , please , wait . Seth ! Don 't come back . Oh , God ... . ( CRIES ) Oh , no . What 's happening to me ? Am I dying ? Is this how it starts ? Am I dying ? Brundle , Seth . Give me a disc . I need the first teleportation : S. Brundle . Run sequence . ( PHONE RINGS ) Hello . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) Seth . Seth , I 've been trying to reach you . Where are you ? BRUNDLE : I 've been afraid to see you . Now I 'm afraid not to . Are you at home ? You don ' t know how right you were . I 've gotten much , much worse . Please come see me . Please come now . Seth ? I 'm here . BRUNDLE : Stop ! Seth ! You were right . I 'm diseased ... ... and it might be contagious somehow . I wouldn 't want to infect you . And it 's been accelerating . It 's unrelenting . Every day there are changes . Every time I look in the mirror , I 'm someone different , repulsive . What happened ? I know an old lady who swallowed a fly Perhaps she 'll die Seth , please . I was not pure . The teleporter insists on purity . I was not pure . I don 't know what you mean . A fly ... ... got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when I was alone . The computer got confused . There weren 't supposed to be two genetic patterns . And it decided to splice us together . It mated us , me and the fly . We hadn 't been properly introduced . My teleporter turned into a gene splicer . A very good one . I 'm not Seth Brundle anymore . I 'm the offspring of Brundle and a housefly . Oh , God . Oh , God , Seth ! You look so pretty . What will happen ? I think it 's showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer . General cellular chaos and revolution . I 'm just gonna disintegrate . In a novel way , no doubt . Then I 'll die . - And then it will be over . - No , I don 't accept that . There must be something we can do , someone to go to , tests to be done . No ! I won 't be just another tumorous bore ... ... talking about his hair falling out and his lost lymph nodes . What do you want me to do ? Why did you call me ? Oh ! Oh . That 's disgusting . My ... ... ear. No ! I 'm scared . Help me . Please , please , help me . - Don 't go back to him . - That 's it ? That 's your advice ? It could be contagious . It could become an epidemic . I have to go back to him . - I don 't believe this . - If you saw him , Stathis ... . If you saw how scared and angry and desperate he is- - I 'm sure Typhoid Mary was nice when you saw her socially . - I do not want- - - I don 't care ! All right , fine , okay . Do I have permission to claim your body when this is over ? Oh , God ... . Look , how about this ? You say , if only I saw him . Show me . Tape him . Show me . Let me think about it . I 'll come up with something . Seth ? Seth ? BRUNDLE : No , no , no . Up here . I 've gotten pretty good at it . Yeah , it 's almost second nature . I stopped biting my nails . Look at this . What 's this ? I don 't know . I seem to be stricken by a disease with a purpose , wouldn 't you say ? Maybe not such a bad disease after all . I can 't stay . No , no , no . Why not ? Why can 't you ? I can 't take it . It 's too much . Why ? The disease has revealed its purpose . We don 't have to worry about contagion . I know what it wants . What does it want ? It wants to turn me into something else . Most people would give anything to be something else . Turned into what ? What do you think , a fly ? Am I becoming a 1 85-pound fly ? No , I 'm becoming something that never existed . I 'm becoming " Brundlefly . " That 's worth a Nobel Prize . Here . I want to give a demonstration ... ... that I think you 'll want to record for posterity . I think you must chronicle ... ... the life and times of Brundlefly , don 't you ? At the very least , it should make a fabulous children 's book . You seem tired . You got me there ? How does Brundlefly eat ? He found out the hard way that he eats like a fly eats . His teeth are now useless . Although he can chew up solid food , he can 't digest it . Solid food hurts . So , like a fly ... ... Brundlefly breaks down solids with a corrosive enzyme playfully called " vomit drop . " He regurgitates on his food . It liquefies . And then he sucks it back up . Ready for a demonstration , kids ? Here it goes . ( BRUNDLE REGURGITATES ) Oh , my God . My God ! ( DOOR OPENS ) Hey , Ronnie . Ronnie ! What is it ? I 'm pregnant . Oh , no . Oh , no . I 'm pregnant with Seth 's baby . What do you want to do ? I don 't know . I just ... . I don 't know . - Stathis , I 'm scared . - It 's going to be all right , Ronnie . It 's going to be fine . I don 't think I want to lose it . - Why am I losing it ? - It 's better this way . You 'll see . It 's the best thing that could happen . GYNECOLOGIST : She 's expelling it .

Come on , push . - No , wait . Give us a push . You can push it out . Come on . No , wait , wait . No . STATHIS : You can do it . Wait . No ! I want a disc . Give me preliminary integration . I want a disc . Give me preliminary integration . You 're relics . Yes , you are . You can 't deny it . Vestigial , archaeological , redundant . Artifacts of a bygone era . Of historical interest only . You 've missed some good moments . Is that why you 're here ? To catch up ? I wanted ... . My teeth have begun to fall out . The medicine cabinet 's now the Brundle Museum of Natural History . Want to see it ? No . Then ... ... what do you want ? I came to tell you ... . I just ... . I wanted to see you ... ... before... . You have to leave now ... ... and never come back here . Have you heard of insect politics ? Neither have I . Insects don 't have politics . They 're very brutal . No compassion . No compromise . We can 't trust the insect . I 'd like to become ... ... the first insect politician . I 'd like to ... ... but I 'm afraid ... . I don 't know what you 're trying to say . I 'm saying ... . I 'm saying I 'm an insect ... ... who dreamt he was a man and loved it . But now the dream is over ... ... and the insect is awake . No , Seth . I 'm saying ... ... I 'll hurt you if you stay . ( GROANS ) Let 's go . Let 's do it now . Now ? Wait . Wait a minute . What did he say ? I couldn 't tell him . Let 's go , damn it . No ! I think we should wait a few days . You 're not in the right state of mind . I want it out of my body now . You should have seen him . There could be anything in here , in me , in my body . I don 't know if I can arrange it now , tonight . Why do we have to- - ? I don 't want it . Understand ? I don 't want it in my body ! Well , okay , what 's the story ? She 's pregnant and she wants an abortion . In the middle of the night ? We have good reason to think that ... ... this child will be deformed . - Yeah , but in the middle of the night ? - Look , Brent . Please . Is it your child ? No . It 's the child of a man who is deformed . I don 't mean to interfere ... ... but I detect a certain uncertainty here . There are tests we can do to determine whether- - I don 't want tests . Tests can 't guarantee anything . The baby could start off normal , then become ... . I want an abortion . I 'll do it myself if I have to . If you 'll slip into that , we 'll be on our way in no time . No . Wait , Seth , no . Why did you want to kill Brundle ? The baby might be all that 's left of the real me . Please don 't kill me . I can 't have it . I 'm afraid . Please , have the baby . I can 't . I can 't . Too bad . Too bad . ( SCREECHES ) Jesus ! Ah ! VERONICA : No , don 't . Don 't , please . Please . Help me .

She , in turn , will answer to me . I , in turn , will answer to nobody but God . From God 's mouth to your ears , that is the chain of command . Is that understood ? JAINWAY : Here we have an average 1 1 - month-old child . And here we have our 1 1 - month-old child . As you can see , his life cycle is dramatically accelerated . Now , these are aberrant chromosomes . Obviously a product of genetic mutation . These are all dormant , something in addition to accelerated growth . And his non-genetic characteristics ? His learning abilities , for example . He 's got a photographic memory . He doesn 't just learn , he consumes information . And he never sleeps . Is that so ? Do you like him ? Well , as a clinical subject , I find him astonishing . But he does try our patience when it comes to medical examinations . I think it 's time our young guest and I became acquainted . We 're not interrupting , are we ? Not at all , Mr. Bartok . What a handsome young man you are . Do you know who I am ? Yes , you 're one of the people who lives behind the mirror . Well , my name is Mr. Bartok . I 'd like you to think of me as your dad . Martin ... ... what 's that behind your ear ? You know , it 's knowing the right magic word that makes it happen . It 's a real magic word , a secret word that you keep locked away ... ... inside your heart and you never tell anybody . No , you don 't tell anybody , and that 's what makes the magic work . SHEPARD : Martin . Martin , are you listening to me ? Dr. Shepard ... ... I don 't mean to be rude by not facing you . But those tests are far too simple to demand my full attention . Besides , I 'm almost finished . So am I , Martin . I just have to time you on this maze , and we can both do something we enjoy . Very impressive , Martin . People , may I have your attention ? I 've grown tired of your trivial influence . Another outburst and I 'll be forced to make an example of you . You 've outdone yourself . But what else does it do ? ( SIGHS ) JAINWAY : Keep still , Martin . Stop fidgeting . Is Mr. Bartok gonna visit today ? You know how busy he is . He has that project in zone four . Oh , yeah . Can I go visit him ? - Of course not , you 're not allowed . - Why ? Because you don 't have zone four clearance . How much longer do I have to take these shots for ? As long as you would like to live . Why don 't I have clearance ? Because you 're only a zone three project . You 're fidgeting . It 's normal behavior . I read it in a book for mothers . Want to see ? No , thank you . Now , sit still or Mr. Bartok will be very disappointed in you . ( COMPUTER WHIRS ) ( FLIES BUZZING ) You know , I got this disease ... ... so rare , there 's only been two people who 've ever had it . My father . And now me . They even named it after him . It 's called Brundle 's Accelerated Growth Syndrome . The doctors say it means I 'm growing up a lot faster than I 'm supposed to . Which isn 't so bad , I guess . But I think it also means that I 'm gonna die a lot sooner . Which isn 't so great . SHEPARD OVER INTERCOM : Today is your lucky day , Martin . Lamb chops and French fries . Your favorite , isn ' t it ? Yes , sir . ( SNORES ) ( COMPUTER WHIRS ) ( ELEVATOR RUMBLES ) Initiate sequence , please . It 's okay . It worked ! He 's moving around . He 's still alive ! ( SCREAMING ) How the hell did he get in here ? What 's wrong ? ( SINGING " HAPPY BIRTHDAY " ) - Happy birthday . - Thank you , everybody . Blow out the candles . Don 't forget to make a wish . Martin , the whole team wants you to know ... ... how happy we are to share your fifth birthday . What 's your wish ? You know what I want ? Your privacy . And I think it 's about time you got it . Say the magic word ... ... and make the mirror disappear . - I don 't think I should go too far- - - Nonsense , it 's a beautiful day . Fresh air will do you good . You should get out more often . You mean , this is mine ? This is my place ? Your place . Your private place . No more mirrors , no more prying eyes . ( TOILET FLUSHES ) MARTIN : Wow . Whee ! So do you like it ? Yes . I know it hasn 't been easy growing up in such a clinical environment . Due to your unique affliction , it 's been unavoidable . You 've been very good to me . I don 't know how to thank you . Perhaps I can think of something . I 'd like you to consider taking a position here at Bartok lndustries . - Position ? - Something challenging . To keep you from being bored . A match for your intellect , your creative mind . I 'm talking about a job . BARTOK : Five years and millions of dollars later ... ... and what we have is- - What we have is the world 's most expensive ... ... juicer. The greatest invention in the history of mankind ... ... and we can 't get the damn thing to work . We 're like chimpanzees trying to figure out how to operate a car . Your father was a brilliant man . Brilliant , but erratic . When he died , some of his secrets died with him . You could finish your father 's work . You 're as brilliant as he was , perhaps even more so . I don 't like these things . It 's because of the dog , isn 't it ? How long will you hold that against me ? It was a tragic mistake , but that 's in the past now . You must concentrate on the future . The future is right here in this very room . Imagine a new era of surgery without incision . Cutting people would be primitive , a thing of the past . All the things that would become obsolete overnight . That 's what these machines represent . A new age . If you want personnel ... ... Dr. Trimble and his people are at your disposal . If you want to work alone , fine . It 's your choice . Martin ... ... we did everything we could for your dog . Take comfort in knowing he didn 't suffer long . And one more thing . Your father kept a record of his progress . Before you decide ... ... listen to your father . RONNIE OVER TV : We 've just seen the first teleportation of a human being . Dr. Seth Brundle , how did it feel going through ? SETH OVER TV : It felt like a stutter . RONNIE : A what ? SETH : A stutter , you know , a hiccup . A slight dislocation of my physical life . Not unpleasant , just a little interruption of rhythm . At first I thought it didn ' t work . I thought I was in the same telepod . RONNIE : And now , how do you feel ? SETH : I should feel exactly the same as before but I don ' t . I feel very energized , very coordinated . I feel as though I work better physically , you know ? Everything seems to just work better than it ever did before . RONNIE : Why should that be ? I don ' t know . It 's possible that the teleporter somehow improved me . In reassembling me , it might have seen where things could be improved theoretically , and it did it . I told it to be creative , and maybe it has been . OPERATOR : How can I help you ? Do you have any organic matter that I can borrow ? Excuse me ? A potato , a plant , something living . You 'll have to speak to maintenance , and they won ' t be in until 8 : 00 a.m. Eight ? Well , thanks anyway . ( STUN GUN BUZZES ) SCORBY : Hey , got a visitor . WILEY : It 's Bartok 's brat . That kid gets away with murder . Don 't worry , he 'll get his someday . Nice catch . What is this ? A fly . An artificial fly for fishing . I guess you don 't fish . I don 't get out much . BETH : I 'd go crazy without some diversion . CRT burnout till 3 : 00 in the morning . I heard Bartok was good for advancement . I 've been here six months , and I 'm still computer filing . Graveyard shift , no less . Are you new here ? I 've been here five years . Five years and you still work nights ? I work days too . When do you sleep ? I don 't . You don 't ? I got that in California . So what are you working on ? The most important invention in the history of mankind . With my cactus ? Yes . I 'm talking change beyond imagination . The big leap from Stone Age to microtechnologies . Would you like to come up to my lab and watch , Beth Logan ? I have to give you points for originality . You don 't believe me ? Look , don 't take this personally , but- - Should I ? I love living on a houseboat . It 's peaceful on the water . - Houseboat ? - Hey , wait a minute , Martin . I can 't go any further . I don 't have any clearance for this sector . Poof ! You have clearance . ( TELEPORT BUZZES ) Wait . What did you just do ? I 've broken down the cactus 's molecular structure ... ... and teleported it from one pod to the other . And ... . What 's that ? It wasn 't supposed to do this . Something ... . I 'm sorry . You keep it . I have to get back to work anyway . But I enjoyed meeting you , Martin Brundle . Maybe you should beta test the program . Beth ... ... would you like to visit me again ? - I don 't want to disturb you . - You wouldn 't . You see , I have no friends here , only acquaintances , and ... ... I would like us to be friends . - Is that possible ? - I 'd like that . I , um ... . I get a dinner break every night at 1 0 : 00 . Great . Why don 't you come down here ? If you like , you can help with the telepods . Okay . Maybe we could fix my plant . Hey , Marty ? What 's the good word ? Got yourself a girlfriend now ? No . Too bad . Nice ass . Last night , I slept for two hours . The longest I 've ever slept . I 'm not willing to attach any significance to it . Why not ? It means I 'm slowing down , stabilizing , becoming normal . It doesn 't necessarily follow . You 're just working too hard . If you were undergoing a metabolic change we would have found it by now . You 're missing my vein . ( MARTIN YELLS ) That 's what you get for not sitting still ! Now let 's try it again . I don 't think so . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ) BETH : A friend of mine in specimens division asked me up there tomorrow . They 're having sort of an office get-together . Do you want to come ? Will there be people there ? Yeah , there usually are at get-togethers . But nice people . You 'd be surprised . - Yeah ? - Yes . So that 's your genius . He is cute . I told you , but he 's shy . I hope he 's enjoying himself . WOMAN : I 've never seen anything like it before in my life . What is it ? We don 't make them , we keep them alive . It 's so ugly . He 's our pride and joy in specimens . Our longest running engagement . Two years . That 's been alive for two years ? We call him Timex . " Takes a licking , keeps on ticking . " Hi . Hi . ( HOWLS ) Leave me alone . Martin ! - Martin , what 's the matter ? - I said to leave me alone , Beth . Talk to me . I thought we were friends . - I didn 't know- - - Stay out of my sector ! You no longer have clearance . ( BARKS ) ( DOG WHINES ) BARTOK : Martin . There was an unfortunate incident in the specimens division last night . Someone broke in and caused some damage . You wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? No . He 's lying . Of course , he 's lying . It seems our Martin is growing up . MARTIN : Hi . BETH : Hi . MARTIN : I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . I missed you . You did ? Really ? Come here , I want to show you something . Okay , close your eyes . Ta-da ! Oh , gosh . Look at it . Yes . Come here . Where you going ? Martin , what are you doing ? You can 't do that . It 's all right . Initiate the sequence . No , I can 't . Martin . Trust me . Hi . That 's wonderful . How did you do this ? I started from scratch . Trimble and the rest asked the wrong questions , made the same mistakes . They were too close to the problem to see it clearly . Scientific myopia . They thought of it in terms of methodology , of physics . Absolutes . But you have to be able to open your eyes and admire ... ... the beauty of the process . Martin . What ? What is this ? Just a little accident . Well , it 's getting all infected . You 'd better have it looked at . I have to go now . It 's just an infection . This antibiotic- - MARTIN : Don 't patronize me , Shepard ! This is obviously not an infection . What 's going to happen ? Will I lose my arm ? Of course not . Now this injection will clear it up right away . You 're going to have to trust me . MARTIN : I don ' t trust you . I want to see Mr. Bartok . - There 's no doubt . JAINWAY : None at all . Early stages of genetic metamorphosis have been showing up on tests . His aberrant chromosomes are not dormant . Now that he 's reached full maturity , they 're growing ... ... changing , becoming more defined . How fast ? Like wild fire . You know what to do , what preparations to make . Get on with it . ( DOOR BUZZES ) SCORBY : You having a problem , Ms. Logan ? My card isn 't working , it 's not opening the door . Nothing wrong with your card . It 's just not your door anymore . - What 're you talking about ? - It looks like ... ... your transfer to the day shift finally came through . Just like you wanted . Systems analysis ? This is in a building across town . We 've already sent your personal effects over . That 's what you get for fucking around with Bartok 's pet freak . For your eyes only . Bye-bye . OPERATOR : May I help you ? Yes , I 'd like an outside line , please . I 'm sorry , sir , all outside lines are busy . Please try again later . Thank you . OPERATOR : Bartok lndustries , may I help you ? I 'd like to speak with Martin Brundle . There is no Martin Brundle here . Please try again . Now , you listen to me . I know- - ( PHONE RINGS ) MARTIN : Beth ? - Martin ? - You all right ? - Oh , my God ! I 've been trying to call you . You okay ? Something is happening to me . I don 't know what . I was transferred . They found out . Bartok knows about us . We never told anyone . Because he saw us . He videotaped us in bed . That 's it . He 's found it . You 'd better call Bartok , tell him the kid 's pissed . ( PHONE RINGS ) I see . We lost video completely . BARTOK : Where is he now ? - Could be anywhere . You 're not allowed in here . Get out ! STATHIS ON TV : You don ' t know anything . I was there . I upset Brundle . He was trying to cure himself , can ' t you see that ? You gotta help Ronnie , she 's pregnant with his child . BARTOK ON TV : You and I are gonna be very good friends , you think ? Well , I know we are . I want us to- - I want us to be more than friends . I want you to think of me as your dad . MARTIN : You mean this is my place ? Your place , your private place . No more mirrors , no more prying eyes . Go on , take a look . ( TYPES ) ( BETH BREATHES HEAVILY ) SETH : A fly got into that transmitter pod with me that first time . The computer got confused . There weren ' t supposed to be two separate genetic patterns . And then decided to splice us together . It mated us , me and the fly . BARTOK : Now you know . A rather rude awakening , but at least we can drop all pretense now . Martin ... ... you will soon become ... ... the most unique living creature on the face of the earth . No , I won 't . There 's nothing you or I , or anyone can do to stop it . I 'll take my ... ... medications , my injections . They 're merely water ... ... placebo. We had to give you some sense of hope , otherwise ... . You ... . You ... ... want this to happen ? Of course , I want it to happen . You 're the prototype ... ... for a whole new age of biological exploration . With you as the model ... ... and the telepods as the tool ... ... Bartok lndustry ... ... will control the form and function of all life on earth . Calmly , Martin . Accept it . This was planned from the day you were born . We 'll do everything we can to make it as painless as possible for you . I loved you . Get Scorby . MAN OVER INTERCOM : Scorby , report to the main station . We have a situation . OFFICER : Come back ! You guys , stay here . You want out ? You have to go through me , Marty . I enjoyed that tape of you and your girlfriend . Girl goes like a jackhammer , doesn 't she ? ( LAUGHS ) I don 't want excuses . I want him back . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Are you ready for me , Dr. Trimble ? - Yes , Mr. Bartok . - Let 's get on with it . I 'd like to see these things work . - What the hell is this ? TRIMBLE : Just bypass the damn thing . - Son of a bitch . - Trimble , my patience is wearing thin . Sir , it seems the head of this project has seen fit to install a password . - Martin has installed a password ? TECHNICIAN : Yes , sir . We can 't access the system without it . Well , feed it words at random . He 's booby trapped it . The first wrong guess we make would automatically erase the programming . " What is the magic word " ? " Abracadabra . " That 's the magic word . Everybody knows that . No . No , there is a real magic word ... ... and only Martin knows what it is . This is the word that makes it all happen . Damn ! Clever . Clever boy . ( DOG BARKS ) ( CAR STOPS ) ( MARTIN THUDS ) - Martin ! - Don 't be frightened . Oh , my God . What happened ? I didn 't know where else to go . You need your medication . We have to get you back . There 's no medication for what I have . What ? There never was . They were all just ... ... waiting for ... . For this ... ... to happen . I had to see you , Beth . Do you want me to go ? No . Then help me . Please ? Yes . All right , let 's go . Thomas , go upstairs . Chris , help out . ( CAT MEOWS ) - Anything upstairs , Thomas ? THOMAS : Only a cat . Jesus ! Go check the dock . Chris , go with him . The girl ? SCORBY : She went with him . Well , get back here as soon as you can . Yes . Don 't worry , sir , we 'll get him . It 's just a matter of time . That , sadly , is a luxury we don 't have . STATHIS : Go away . - We have to talk to you , sir . - I said piss off ! Seth Brundle was my father . Striking family resemblance . Little big for 5 years old . I have a chromosomal malfunction . I 'm growing at an accelerated rate . No shit ? That 's fascinating . Well ... . Listen , it 's been great . Stop by again some time . Perhaps I should invite you in . I saw you on the videotape . Don 't sit there ! You were there the night my father died . He was working on a cure . That 's why you dragged yourself out here ? To find out about a cure ? You 're my only hope . Oh , kid ... ... the last thing I am is anybody 's hope . You really don 't want to hear about this . I have to know . Brundle stole my girl . Your mother . Got her pregnant , caused her death . Dissolved my hand and my foot with fly vomit . I had no love for the man . He bugged me . As for the cure he was working on ... ... he dragged your mother ... ... kicking and screaming into that telepod ... ... that they might be fused together in one beautiful body . So your mother blew his brains out with a shotgun . There 's your cure . Go away . You bastard ! Where 's your compassion ? I had to give it up . It cost me an arm and a leg . It cost you more than that . Your father was right about one thing . If there 's a cure , it has something to do with those pods . That ... . They won 't work . You 're a bad liar , kid . If you found the answer , use it . Martin , did you find- - ? It 's nothing I can use . So forget it . Let 's go . You should talk some sense to your friend . They 'll be looking for your car . My Jeep 's in the garage . Just ... ... get out . - Let me just call Bartok . - No , I 'm not going back there . He can help . I 'll tell him about the tele- - - That 's a dead end . - You haven 't told me why . The only way I could save myself would be to sacrifice another life . ( CLEARS THROAT ) I 'd like a room , please . All I have is a queen size . Is that okay ? That 'll be fine . Cash in advance . Brundle vanished late last night with co-worker , Beth Logan . There has been speculation that Ms. Logan was kidnapped but this has yet to be confirmed . Number nine ... ... Miss... ... Smith. Martin ? Martin ! Martin ! Martin ! ( HORN HONKS ) Martin , stop . Please don 't run away from me . I don 't know what to do . I don 't either . Martin , I 'm not gonna leave you . No . ( BUG ZAPPER BUZZES ) MARTIN : How peaceful that light is . Compelling . What ? You ... ... should go . You need help . You don 't think I can take care of myself ? No . You can 't walk . You 're getting worse . I 'm getting better . My body ... ... is growing ... ... stronger. I feel good . You don 't know what you 're saying . I do know what I 'm saying . Until now , I 've been nothing more than an open wound . Defenseless ... ... weak , vulnerable . Don 't you see ... ... I 'm healing . I 'm healing . It wasn 't clear to me for a long time . But now ... . I can see so much better now . Beth , if you stay a while , I 'll show you a magic trick ... ... you 'll never forget . Martin , what about the telepods ? You must tell me what the magic word is . The word is ... . It 's a secret word . Do you remember this room , Martin ? This is where you were born the first time . It 's proper that this is the place for your rebirth , don 't you think ? You 're growing so quickly , my boy . Any prediction how soon ? I 'd say at least a week . Martin ... ... if you can hear me ... ... I wanted to tell you I 'm thrilled to have you back . How it was naughty of you to run away . I forgive you . I should thank you ... ... for the magic you worked with my telepods . Don 't ever forget that , Martin . You 're a magician , not an escape artist . Welcome home , son . Nothing 's wrong with me , you assholes ! Let me go ! Where 's Martin ? Where 's Martin ? It 's dirty work , Mackenzie , but somebody 's gotta do it . Make sure you don 't miss anything . You 'll be pleased to know you show no signs of contamination . Please , sit down . You really have no choice . Where is Martin ? He 's doing very , very well . Thank you . Resting comfortably . But of more importance right now ... ... is you telling me ... ... the magic word . ( MACHINE BEEPS ) ( MARTIN GURGLES ) ( MACHINE BEEPS ) ( SCREAMS ) Dr. Jainway ? ( SHEPARD SCREAMS ) SCORBY : Dr. Shepard ? What 's wrong ? What 's happening , man ? What is it ? Back in the O.R. You were alone with him all that time , just you and he . He must 've told you something . You have no intention of helping Martin , and you never did . You 're not going anywhere . Vargas . Bartok , Martin got out of his cocoon . He 's out there somewhere . - Has anyone seen him ? - Yeah . Dr. Jainway . She 's dead . He killed her . Control , this is Bartok . Listen carefully . I do not under any circumstances want Martin injured or killed . He is to be contained . Anyone responsible for damage to him will answer to me . Is that clear ? Yes , sir . Code four alert . Code four unit , quarters 12 , 14 and 17 . Subject is dangerous . All zone four units to be armed . This is to be a live capture . Repeat , live capture . Control , at the end of corridor A , something 's moving around down there . There are no other exits . You 've got it trapped . Sick him . ( DOG BARKS ) Let 's check it out . ( CLATTERING ) - Has anyone found him ? - Not yet . We 're not exactly sure what he looks like . Hold it . You wouldn 't believe what I 'm looking at , sir . Whatever it is , it 's dragging a body . What direction is it headed ? I 'd have to say , Mr. Bartok , it 's headed right in your direction . Seal the door . Get reinforcements . We can trap him in the hallway . - It 's got a security card . - Erase the code ? Trimble ! I 've got him . He 's right outside Bay 1 7 . Send reinforcements right now ! Shit ! Great , just fucking great . Come on , freak . Shit ! Sorry guys , looks like I lost him . There 's no sign of him anywhere . ( SCREAMS ) It can 't get in here , can it ? Nothing gets through those doors . The upper doors have a manual lockout . Vargas , let 's get him . - Jesus , look at that . - Dispatch . Medical emergency , Bay 1 7 . I got two men down . I 'm going after it . Paul stay with him . The rest of you let 's go . Come on ! - Just tell them to kill it . - Don 't be an idiot . I need a live subject . Martin is of no use dead . He 's right , Mr. Bartok . Your Martin 's already killed three people . That 's tragic and sad , but I haven 't come this far to lose everything now . Clever . Clever boy . OFFICER : Control , he 's in the air ducts headed for zone four . Control , where 's that air duct lead ? Hold on , hold on . I 'm getting it . Where ? ! Bay 1 7 , observation level . BETH : Martin . - Don 't shoot , idiot ! - Kill the damn thing . - No ! - No ! Vargas ! Vargas , get out of there ! I want him alive , damn you . BARTOK : Scorby ! ( METAL CLANKS ) We 're outside Bay 1 7 , we 're cutting in . WILEY : Spray the room . Fuck . ( METAL CLANKS ) ( METAL CLANKS ) Fuck ! Scorby ? Scorby ! Where are you ? No . No , no ! Martin ... ... I know you can understand me . Don 't do anything rash . I won 't hesitate to kill you in a second , if I have to . I almost wish it didn 't have to end like this . Goodbye , Martin . What are you doing ? No ! No . No ! No ! No ! Don 't ! No . No ! ( GROWLS ) ( MARTIN GRUNTS ) Martin ! Martin ! Martin . - I 'm all right . - Martin ? I 'm all right .

 How can this have happened ? It was in the box for thousands of years , building its power , its strength . It was time . We should have known . The evil power will be looking for the greatest forces in this world . It will want to destroy all that is good , all that stands for right . There is a great being . His name is Superboy . He lives on the northern continent . Ah , the evil power will find this Superboy . It will destroy him . Unless you find this boy first . Give him the secret to defeat the evil power that has escaped from us . He will have use this potion . It contains the blood of our fathers . Otherwise , he will have no chance of defeating the evil . Yes , I will find the boy . I will not fail . Remember , you may only guide this Superboy . He alone will have to fight the power . Karate lessons for free . Surprised me , too- - I always figured Seth thought of you as obnoxious . Obnoxious ? You know Seth and I have been going out for a while . Well , listen , you think what you wanna think , but a guy knows what a guy knows . Hey jerk , watch your step . " Jerk , " huh ? Of my name . You got a problem ? Oh , now we have your sister defending you . To give these guys some trouble . Lana , wait- - Of jerks like you pushing people around . So what are you gonna do about it , make a phone call ? I have a quarter . Hey ! Wow , yeah ! All right ! That was phenomenal , that was really great . Ah , you know , I wish Clark had been here , like--well , like me , you know ? We are a team , babe . You and me , like well-oiled gears . You know , I got the brains , on the mat . Nice job , Andy . Ow . Very good , Marcia . It takes many years of practice to become proficient in the art of karate . This is your first time at class . No kidding . Hi . I thought you were supposed to flip someone that sneaks up on you . Sometimes the best defense is no defense . Come on , you lovebirds . That I can participate in , huh ? I really would like to meet him , you might have about Superboy . Your rules , remember ? Listen , you wanna talk about Superboy , you ? Oh , yeah , uh , Clark talks to him , you know , really ? You spend a lot of time with him ? So tell me , do you ever get in touch with Superboy ? But yes , once in a while I pick up the phone and , yes , magic happens . Yeah , sure . L-Lana ? Clark gonna show up , or what ? I mean , he said he was gonna try and make it . Well , you know , I lent him my car , and if he hurts my caddy- - Excuse me , officer , what happened here ? You better stay back . You are Clark Kent . I am looking for someone . Do you know what did this ? They call superboy . I know where to find Superboy . He must meet me tonight , at the place of many heavens . Whoa ! Oh ... Nice . Nice for the ego . This is your first lesson , Andy . People twice your size . Class dismissed . I have to go over with my accountant here at the studio . For over three weeks now . Is something wrong ? Strange lately . Business is business , Lana . Have an extra ticket or something inside . Okay , I was busy tonight anyway ! Flossing my cat or something . Yeah ... Yeah , list-listen , um , thanks a lot for the lessons , huh ? Sure , no problem . Entrer . - Is Clark here ? - Uh , no , sorry . I called the studio , I called his apartment , all I know is we had something really good I mean , I finally find a guy who I think can take my mind off Superboy , and he turns out just like the rest of them . Hey . It will try to find you through people close to you . Ah , it also possesses bodies , and can learn through what they see . It has no shape , and yet it has all shapes . It cannot be seen , yet it corrupts the physical universe . It is very powerful . But with this potion , you can win . But you must use this potion . Without it , the evil force is all-powerful . The evil must be put in the box . How will I find it ? It will find you . Pray for me , pray for my wretched , wretched soul . Ah ! Where is he ? Where is the one they call Superboy ? Ah ... Ah ! Andy ! Clark ? Ugh ... Andy , are you all right ? Ugh ... Ugh ... That was the weirdest thing I ever saw . All I saw was-was papers flying all over the place . And there was this voice . There was this voice . It was asking for Superboy . Lana , I dream about . Lana--do you know where she is right now ? Yeah , she , um , she went to catch Seth at his studio . Or something like that and , uh ... Okay , roomie ? Seth ? Is anyone here ? Seth ? You lied to me . Then when ? I really thought you cared about me . You gotta believe that . The being you knew as Seth is no more . I have just devoured his soul . Now I am strong enough to rid myself of this human husk . Now there is no need to seek Superboy out . I can sense his presence growing near . Lana ! You carry the astral box . I know what you are . Knowing will not help you . You are a powerful champion who fights for good , Superboy . But you are still no match for me . Oh yeah ? I am a force even you cannot reckon with . I am evil incarnate ! Stop it ! I have waited thousands of years for this battle . No ! Once I destroy you , there will be no force on earth left to stand in my way . Evil will run rampant as never before ! Each time I attack , the power of my evil grows , and the good in you grows weaker . Ha-ha-ha ! Leave him alone ! This is one battle you cannot win . Lana ! The potion ! Ha-ha-ha , ha-ha-ha ! Argh ! The evil has been vanquished . You have saved millions of people from needless suffering . Not everyone . Not even your shoulders can carry the weight of each life as it crosses your path , Superboy . You are aware of the terms ? Yes . Wanted me to return his body to your valley . Well , here in our realm , life and death are mere states of mind . Can he ever return ? As soon as he steps out of the valley , he perishes . Seth must always remain with us now . He is the keeper of the box . Here in this land , they tell me I can live forever . I guess I should be happy . You will be , Lana . If she had decided to stay , would you have still brought her ? Yes . You care for her more than she knows . Thank you . Captioned by Grant Brown

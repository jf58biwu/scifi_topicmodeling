Two thousand from [ indistinct ] and three thousand from the archaeology department . Well , they should have been able to dig up more than that . [ chuckles ] Med school , 1500 . Great ! Who 'll they think is betting all this money against our glorious Shuster basketball team ? A bookie from Cleveland . Great . Great . Well , Mr. Superstar , first pick in the basketball draft . I 'll drove you again . And do you why ? No . 'Cause golf takes brains . Just like making money takes brains . So you leave it to me and we 'll both come out okay . Please , Lex . Don 't make me do it . Make you do it ? Make you do what ? - Lose . - Lose ? You call winning the money losing ? [ Lex chuckles ] You call thrilling all those people with your dribbling and passing .. ... shooting and rebounding losing ? You call missing a few extra shots or dropping a key pass or-or committing a silly foul losing ? I call it human . You keep the money , I don 't want it . Splendid . - Then I can play to win ? - You can do what I tell you . State beats our heroic Shuster in the big game . Giving you a chance to control your own destiny . If I tell what I know ... you 'll be out of the game . Out of luck .. ... and out of school . And then ... I 'm going to kill you . [ dramatic music ] ( coach ) Get under that . Hit it ! Alright ! Alright . Come on , Stretch . That 's the way . That 's the way to go . Get on him . Get on him , Stretch . [ whistle blowing ] No no no . Time out ! Stretch . Go sit down . Take a rest . Moose , go on for Stretch . ( coach ) Okay , guys , Just keep it going . [ whistle blowing ] What 's your problem , son ? No problem . I can 't be perfect all the time . Hey , I know that we ask a lot out of you . But you always deliver . Yeah , what if I can 't ? What if I 'm just playing lousy ? Take it easy , son . You know , easy for you . It 's not so damn easy for me . All I ever hear is , " You can do it , Stretch . " " You can do it , Stretch . " " You can do it , Stretch . " If I can 't do it .. Hey , relax . It 's just another game . Look , forget about today 's practice . You go home and get some rest , huh ? I 'll talk to you later . Okay , now look , I want you to drive , Mikey . Stretch , what 's going on ? Not now , Clark . You already got your scoop of the day . Bit Star 's whining cry baby . Don 't be so hard on yourself , man . I mean , you lead the team all season . All you have to do is give it your best shot . Oh , I shot my best shot a long time ago . Hey , I know you . You 'll do great . Not if I help that Luthor rat . [ jazz music ] Lex , I 'd like to talk to you . [ girls chuckling ] Leo . I assume you 've come to apologize for the nasty things you write about me in the Shuster Herald . ( Clark ) Nasty , but true . My job 's to report the truth , be it nasty or nice . That 's why I 'm here . What truth do you seek for ? You are the resident maker of the odds . So I am . Get this down . Ra-ra-ra . [ chuckles ] Sis-boom-ba . Go Shuster . [ Leo laughs ] ( Lex ) Is that enough ? How about the game where you 're predicting a victory ? There 's no doubt as to the outcome . - Did you bet on it ? - I never gamble . What are I do is invest capital . And only when a large return is assured . What about the game ? Is that a good investment ? That , my dear fellow Shuster , is privileged information . It is available only to the paid up subscribers to The Lex Luthor Letter . My financial advisory service . [ telephone ringing ] Hello . Who ? Lex ? Eh , hold on . Lex Luthor here . Well .. Would you excuse me for just a second ? This is a personal call . Wait around , if you 'd like . [ music continues ] ( Lex ) What else can I tell you , my dear boy ? [ click ] No , I think I got what I came for , Lex . Good . Well , then , just to show that there are no grudges what juicy tit-bit would you like me to pass on to your readers ? Perhaps a little something about .. ... your friend Lana 's love life . [ Clark laughs ] You crack me up . That 's a joke right . [ Leo laughs ] How 'd you get to be such a jerk ? Great genes , hard work and .. ... very , very rich father , Clark . [ Lana clears throat ] Um , Clark ... remember we 're playin ' a game . I know . We have trouble . Lex and Stretch . Well , Mr. Hot Shot . Getting psyched for the game . Yeah , the odd couple . Make that the odds couple . Look at me when I 'm talking to you . Look , man , just leave me alone . ( Stretch ) Enough 's enough . ( Lex ) You will do what I tell you . Can you stop it ! Do you want to play ? Please . God forbid I get in your way . [ Lana laughs ] You better not screw this up . Because if you do .. [ all students laughing ] What happened to Lex ? Oho ! Lex . He tried out the Olympic team . [ all laughing ] Men 's synchronized swimming or what ? You look good , Lex . Let 's go talk to Stretch first . - Hey . - Hi . ( Clark ) We 're here as friends , this is an unofficial visit . Not reporters . You know , I could use some . Okay , friends , speak to me . Don 't do it . Don 't do what ? Luthor , man . He 'll never let you go . How 'd you find out ? You were careless . I-i-it 's always as if you wanted to be stopped . Yeah and now I am . Stopped , finished and washed up . Well , can you tell us about it ? I mean , maybe we can help . He kept inviting me to his parties . And Lex , he doesn 't take no for an answer . So I went . But , you know , it was fun . So he started passing around a joint and everybody was taking hits on it . So what , right ? I mean , even the big judges do it . Uh , not if they want to be bigger judges . I took a few drags .. It 's not like you 're trying out for the Supreme Court well , he showed me some eight by ten glossies . Pictures of me getting stoned . That 's Lex for you . Never without his hidden camera . Yeah . Well , my host , Mr. Luthor , promised to make me front page news . If I didn 't mess up enough to have State beat Shuster . Yeah , he always keeps a promise . Except when he lies . Tell me what to do , Clark . It 's your future , it 's your life . You gotta make the call . I 'm going to make this Stretch hotshot look real bad . I 'm fed up with him getting all the credit . Let him take all the blame . They 'll be enough blame for everybody . What 's that supposed to mean ? Nothing for you to trouble your tiny brain over . You just play normally until you get my signal . Okay . Great . Great . Eh , say , how much do you suppose a corvette goes for nowadays ? [ intense music ] [ spectators cheering ] ( male announcer ) Shuster , 29 . State , 32 . Two more points for Russell . Shuster , 31 . State , 32 . [ spectators cheering ] Basket .

[ whistle blowing ] ( male announcer ) Bad pass by Moose . [ buzzer buzzing ] There is the buzzer ending the first half . [ spectators cheering ] We 're not playing team ball . We 're not looking for the open man . We 're not hitting those offensive boards . We 're not hustling like we 're supposed to . We look like .. T.J. , I 'm trying to give a pep talk here . And we are making far too many mental errors . I don 't know what you 're gettin ' at Moose . You 're going to be sitting down during the second half . Nonetheless , we 're only three points behind . Now , let 's get out there and play like we can play and let 's do better this second half , right ? ( all players ) That 's right ! Right ? ( all players ) Right ! Alright , let 's get together . ( all ) One . Two . Three . Team [ indistinct ] . Let 's go . [ players shouting ] [ spectators cheering ] What about Stretch ? Nobody defies Lex Luthor . Not without paying the price . Why didn 't Moose start there ? - I don 't- - - Go check the locker room . ( male announcer ) Basket . Murrow . State 52 . Shuster 50 . [ whistle blowing ] Offensive foul , 23 . Oh , God ! Moose is in there sleeping like he never was before . A bomb wouldn 't wake him up . I knew we couldn 't depend on that Neanderthal . - So we go with the sure thing . - Got another backup ? Keep your eye on the referee . [ whistle blowing ] No basket . Charge him . 23 . How can you tell me that ? Robbery . Highway robbery . Why don 't you go sell a mask , huh , ref ? [ whistle blowing ] Time . ( male announcer ) Time out . Shuster . [ cheer girls cheering ] [ inhales deeply ] [ clink ] If I were a gambler , I 'd have a safe bet . You 're on Lex 's payroll to make sure State beats Shuster . - Where 'd you get that ? - I can 't reveal my source . But I 'll keep it out of the Herald if you take that money Lex gave you to start a new life and never ever referee another game in any sport , anywhere . - Deal ? - Yeah . Deal . [ instrumental music ] [ spectators cheering ] ( spectators ) Superboy ! Superboy ! Superboy ! Students , ladies and gentlemen , forgive the intrusion . The referee cannot continue he 's got a crook in his back . Since I 've somewhat of a reputation for fairness and I 'm relatively fast on my feet I 'm volunteering to referee the remainder of the game . [ spectators cheering ] Superboy ! Are there any objections from the coaches or the players ? No ? Let 's play ball . [ whistle blowing ] [ spectators cheering ] Alright ! [ whistle blowing ] ( male announcer ) Basket . State . State leads by two . [ spectators cheering ] Basket . Russell . Score tied . Didn 't I tell you ? Didn 't I tell you it was okay ?

Get these down to the press table and let the world know what a doper he really is . Lex , we 're gonna win . There 's only a couple of seconds left . - Why not leave Stretch alone ? - Just get going . ( male announcer ) Time out . Shuster . [ intense music ] Must have been pretty hot pictures , huh , Leo ? [ cheering continues ] [ whistle blowing ] ( male announcer ) Only nine seconds left . Eight . Seven . Six . Five . Stretch gets this shot off . He 's got the shot off before the buzzer so it 'll count if it drops . [ buzzer buzzing ] It 's through the hoop . Basket is good . Shuster wins ! 72-71 . [ upbeat music ] [ whistle blowing ] Congratulations to State for a well played hard fought game . [ spectators cheer ] And congratulations to Shuster for a well played hard fought victory . I 've been asked to announce that the game ball is going to a non-player . Lex Luthor . Where are you , Lex ? For your tireless efforts in researching the game .. ... and for your valuable numbers and statistics . Congratulations , Lex . The students and faculty would also like to thank Lex Luthor for his valuable contribution of $ 5000 toward the purchase of a new computer to help keep the team stats . Thank you , all . [ spectators applauding ] What a parley . Not only did Lex lose all that money but Superboy squeezed in extra five big ones out . - What a justice . - Yeah . Superboy made it all come out even . He has a sense of symmetry and .. ... sense of compassion and a sense of humor .. ... and purpose and dedication- - If Lana had a dictionary for once . Clark , hi ! - We won . - I know . Where were you ? I was in the locker room , I heard it on the radio . Coach kicked Moose off the team . He was asleep in the dressing room . Phew ! Ha , that 's great . Lex is going to take it out on Stretch . No , I made a deal with Lex . He destroys the negatives that he made of Stretch 's dumb escapade . And we destroy the video that you made of him enlisting Moose to throw the game . Hey , what video ? The one you were going to make , if we needed it . That 's wonderful . I 'm really proud of you , Clark . Even I can jump over tall buildings . Well , I bet Superboy can do more than that . Like run faster than a speeding bullet ? I think you 're jealous of Superboy . Oh , right . Me jealous . - Yeah , you 're jealous . - Nah-h-h ! [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

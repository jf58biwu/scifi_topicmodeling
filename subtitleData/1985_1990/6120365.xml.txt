 Stand up . - You used to be faster . - You used to have more hair . Look at you . What a mess ! What happened to that uniform ... You used to be so proud of ? You 've been roaming the wastelands , brawling with half-men , no doubt . A man needs his exercise . It 's good to see you , sir . I believe we were heading for the same tavern . Let 's go have a drink . - Peacemaker ? - You think I 'm too old ? I can still toss five of the likes of you . I didn 't teach you every trick I know . Taught me enough not to argue with you . Peacemaker is a respectable job . You should try it . How long do you intend to live out in the wastelands ? It 's my home . What happened to regend and lauria wasn 't your fault . We 've all lost families because of the war . You have to let go . The wasteland suits me fine . So where 's meridian ? I 've never heard of it . It 's a small settlement to the east . They 're having disputes over water rights . Why you ? Why not send the enforcers ? Because the council didn 't deem it big enough for the enforcers . And I have a personal interest in meridian . I 've given up teaching . I don 't want to show people to fight anymore . The times are changing . There are more important things to do today . Those of us who survived the wars ... Have a responsibility to those who didn 't . Mom , look ! Wh-what the hell 's that ? Spare some water ? I 'll pay . No need . Jux . Go get some water , please . You 're not from meridian , are you ? No , ma 'am . You come about the work ? Maybe . Ever work on a purification farm before ? Farming 's a little out of my line , but ... Still , when I have to , I can manage . What I 'm offering is food and shelter . Food sounds good . Come on in . My name 's kasha . What shall we call you ? Whatever you like . I 'm not particular . This is tark , my foreman . Tooey and off , his helpers . Tooey will show you to your quarters where you can store your belongings . I hope you like it here . Tooey , back to work . You might as well know the layout from the start . I 'mhead dog on this farm . That woman and child are under my protection , so , unless you want to answer to me , don 't go making trouble for us . Understand ? Mm . - What are you building ' ? - A wind racer . You 're doing a dandy job , fellows . Straight ahead now . A little to the left , please , and thank you ! And break , lads . Hello , cali . Where 'd you get that dirge ? Designed it myself . Good . Wouldn 't it be easier to walk on your hands ? Cali . It 's good to see you . I 've got something for you . A letter , all the way from the city . Can I invite you and your friends in for lunch ? Oh , another time , perhaps . My medical expertise is in need . Not a moment to lose ! Come along , chaps . - Off we go . - See you at the gathering tonight . Straight ahead , lads . Those won 't grow . What ? Those won 't grow . Why not ? You planted them upside down . Too close together . They should be this far apart . - Your mother teach you that ? - No , my father did . But he 's dead now . In the war . He was a commander . Commander terran . - I knew him . - You knew him ? He was a great man . What 's your name ? Jux . Well , jux , I 'll tell you what : You help me with my farm work , I 'll help you build that wind racer . Deal . Tark . Hitch up the wagon and ask the new man to join us . We 're taking him along ? I wouldn 't trust him here alone . Together , we are strong . Strong in our commitment , strong in our purpose . We must make this land live again . Let us not weaken ourselves by leaving the valley , as so many have already done . Help us to brave the summer sandstorms . Let us hold strong against the heat of the wind that cuts through our valley . And let us have the strength to fight even the violence ... Which arises from our valley as well . - Welcome , kasha . - May I speak ? For years now , I 've been advising you to hold onto your land . At times , it hasn 't seemed worth it . But times are about to change . I have just received a letter from the council of the order . A peacemaker has been appointed to this settlement ! The days of fear are over . Now we can farm our land . Seems I arrived just in time for a speech . That 's damnil . It 's just as well you 're here , damnil . The peacemaker 's arrival is more significant to you than the rest of us . Ah , yes . The peacemaker . I 've known about that appointment for some time . No one would be happier to see a peacemaker than I would . I 'm a law-abiding citizen . There 's a lot of dangerous land between here and the city . Anything could happen to a peacemaker on the road these days . Until he arrives , I ... am the authority ... In this valley ! Five cents ! Five cents ! Whoa . Ho . Hello , kasha . Father has your package . The valve . Come on , jux . Let 's play ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Come on ! Hey . Hey . Come on , you owe me a beer . Knock it off . Knock it off . Guess your weight . Step right up , I 'll guess your weight . Hey . Isn 't that her wagon ? Yeah . Let 's go , then . Don 't go away . I 'll be right back . It hurt me much more than it hurts you . How 're ya doin ' ? Fine . I was beginning to wonder ... If we 'd get it before summer . It 's the last one . Take good care of it . I don 't want to get caught without a pump during a sandstorm . We 'll be careful . Come on , jux . Let 's get a sweet roll . Oh ! I thought scud rats only came out at night . You 're a big , fat , slimy pig . If you 're trying to provoke me , you 'll have to do better than that . Your mistress is a whore . Let 's get him ! No ! Hold it . He 's my meat . Get him ! Leave him to me . - Tark ! - Jux ! Ow ! Ow ! Damnil 's going to pay me more for this . Don 't spend it too soon . Clean up this mess . It 's time we found out who this man is . Oh , my god . I didn 't think we could trust him . Terran had a sword like that . He must have been an officer in the guard . - Probably stole it . - Perhaps . He 's dangerous , any way you look at it . I better kill him . No . Don 't do anything yet . We 'll put this in a safe place and keep an eye on him . Where did you learn to fight ? I was a soldier . Will you teach me ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . All right . Come here . I 'll tell you the secret to being a good fighter , but you must promise never to misuse this knowledge . I promise . What 's the secret ? Before you learn to fight , you must first learn to meditate . Meditate ? Yeah . First , draw a triangle . Put your head here . Hands here . Put your knees on your elbows . And then , raise your toes to the sun . When you master that , I 'll teach you . What is it ? Sounds like it 's near the windmill . Look ! I brought you breakfast . You have a healthy appetite . You 're too polite . I eat like a pig . I want to thank you for what you did last night . You like being mysterious , don 't you ? But I know more about you than you think I do . Used to be a soldier . Probably an officer of some rank . And you 're here in the valley for a specific purpose . And what 's that ? It 's obviously not to learn farming . Well , all that matters is that you protected the farm . So I 'm gonna trust you with its secret . Come with me . We 'll be running a pipeline down here , so you 're gonna have to know about this sooner or later . It 's a-torch . My husband searched years for this . I found it just after he died . It 's pure water ? An endless supply of it . Comes out of the ground that way . Let me show you what I 'm gonna do with it . Will you light that , please ? I 'm gonna irrigate this entire valley . See , I 'm gonna build an aqueduct , which will cut straight down the middle . From there , it can branch out to the individual farms . Each farm will have its own source of water . That 's a really - who thought of this ? I did . It 's a really simple . You did ? All by myself . How many people know about this ? Just you and tark . You do realize the hordes that are gonna migrate here . Yes . There 's going to be a new city in meridian . Ahh . What 's the matter ? Never seen a grown man naked ? You 're very cool for a man in your position . Let 's cut off his balls and slit open his gut . You shouldn 't play with sharp objects . Stand back . Give him room . - Very pleasant here . - It was . You got a lot of guts . Of course , you realize if I wanted you killed , you 'd be dead by now . Maybe . I don 't want any trouble . I just want the land . My wells are running dry . I need more water . Well , perhaps you should use it more conservatively . That 's for the peasants . There 's more water here than anyone realizes . I know it 's here . Eventually , I 'll find it . Whoever controls the water controls the valley . I 'd like you to work for me . - Why ? - You 're an impressive man . With you on my side , the peasants lose heart , give up the fight . What would they do ? Where will they go ? What does it matter ? They 're pig herders . They squat anywhere . Their kind always does . Oh , and uh . You 'll make it worth my while . Think about it . Don 't think too long . Work with me , nobody gets hurt . Turn me down , a lot of people get hurt . Oh , no . ? The year of the scud in double-oh-three ? ? And they escaped from the wars ? ? Year of the scud in double-oh-three ? ? Double-oh-three double-oh-three ? ? It was the year of the scud in double-oh-three ? You 're up late . I was restless . It 's been so long since I felt safe on the farm . So , you feel safe now ? Yes . It 's a relief to have the mill working again . Do you think the tubing will hold ? Yes . Blades aren 't too tight ? Are you sure ... That it 's gonna be all right ? Do you ever wonder what people were like before the sandstorms came ? Never lost any sleep over it . What is it ? Just an old injury . Turn over . No , it 's all right . Turn ... over . Relax . I know what I 'm doing . I was married to a soldier once , remember ? You pretend you never feel any pain . You think you 're ... Invulnerable . Just like him . Your husband 's dead . I know . I buried him . You should be proud , kasha . You 've done well on your own . Only because I 've had to . Sun 's coming up . We better get back to the farm . We can repair the blades . Depends on what they did to the pump . Off ! Get out here ! What ? What ? They did the job well . Hopeless ! There 'll be blood to pay for this . - Tark . - Huh ? How far away in damnil 's farm ? I don 't know . Five miles . Maybe five and a half . You interested in a little exercise tonight ? Yeah . We 'll kill them . Scatter their bodies over the plain . We 'll take the mill-listen . Don 't get carried away . All we have to do is steal one valve . Right . Let 's try to do it as quietly as possible . Come on . Let 's go . You know , I really liked him . He was nice , but he was one of those men ... That like tearing your clothes off . Yeah . I tried to tell him , this cost me three gallons to get this . Did you charge him extra ? I just want to get drunk . Well , he was very cute . Yeah , he says he saw a dog ... On the plain by kasha 's farm . A dog ? There 's no way around them , so let 's take them out as quickly as possible . It only takes a moment to break a man 's neck . Just do it quietly . You take the one on the left . Psst . Hey . What ? Whoa . Whoa , there . Whoa . Whoa . We 'll never get across without them seeing us . Hurry up . Disconnect the valve . I need tools . I can 't take it out without breaking it . We 're gonna have to take the whole pump . Feel strong ? I can carry the whole damn windmill if I have to . I 'm tired . Tired ? It 's early for you . You got to sleep last night . Some of us had work to do . Who says I got to sleep last night ? Oh yeah ? What kept you up ? I 'm not saying . But I tell you , old jenkin should buy his daughter a new cot . You never touched jenkin 's daughter . More like it was one of the old man 's pigs . Hard to tell the two apart in the dark . You should know . You boys head off . Tavern 's closed . Hyah ! Hyah . Hyah . Hyah ! Get ! Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Whoa . You took your sweet time with that . Look at it this way , we 're half way home already . Well , what happened ? It was that stranger . He cut through us like a sandstorm . I 've never seen anyone so fast . We should have killed him when he was having his bath . Let 's kill him now . It 's obvious you can 't handle it . We need a professional . Find sho . You know where he is . What 've you two been doing all night ? Where did you get it ? Damnil lent it to us . Took it right out from under his nose . You stole one of damnil 's pumps ? Yes . That 's great . - How did you do it ? - Just walked in and took it . He must be furious . That 's amazing . That 's . That 's great . Way to go . But wait , I didn 't do it alone . Don 't just stand there , tooey . Let 's go get the man a drink . Oh , yeah . I don 't believe this . On your mark . Get set . Go . Sorry . You get that one . Yes . - Can I get a sweet roll ? - Sure , but don 't get lost . I won 't . Tark . What are you doing here ? Let 's go . There you go , telling me what to do again . You think you 're boss ? I 'm not taking orders from you anymore . I don 't take orders from no one . Come on , you pig sticker . Come on . I 'm not afraid of you . I can take a hundred of you . Oh , there you go , running away . I knew you were a coward . You come out of nowhere and start ruining everything . You make her think you 're better than anyone else . Oh , I 'm no good . Probably gonna just go off somewhere and rot . You 'll never miss me . Nobody wants a worn-out old soldier anyway . What do you think I am ? Come on . Let 's go home . Here . I feel like a rat turd . You smell like one . What happened to you ? Oh , nothing , jux . He 's all right . Let 's take him back to the farm . You know something ? You 're not so disgusting . Oh , you act tough . No , no . You don 't make me puke . Thanks . Take jux home . Go . Hey . That 's him . That 's your man . I am sho . - Haven 't we met before ? - Not in combat . You wear the vest of a guard . I was a captain of the elite . But now you 're an assassin . We all have to make a living . Well , it 's time for you to earn it . You 're very anxious to die . You don 't even have a sword . I don 't need one . Please don 't insult me . I want this to be sporting . I don 't suppose any of these peasants have a sword they can lend you ? Then we will fight with staves . You 're very good . But I think a little out of practice . We won 't know that till it 's over . Jux , run home . Stop ! Grab the boy . Finish him off . Shut up ! If you interfere with me again , I 'll cut your head off . The contest isn 't over ... Yet . Let 's go . Tark . Tark ! Tark ! How could I let this happen ? It 's not your fault . If I hadn 't pushed damnil , tark would still be alive and jux would be home safe . It 's not you . It 's me . I attract violence . What are you talking about ? This has happened before . It 's not going to happen again . What are you doing ? I 'm going to get jux . No . You 're crazy . You 're in no condition to fight anybody . I 'll ... go to damnil . I 'll talk to him . I 'll reason with him . I know these men , kasha . There 's only one way to reason with them . But we can 't fight them ! They have my son . They only took jux ... Because they knew I would come . All right . If you must go , you 'll need your sword back . Kasha ! Kasha ! He 'll be here . Good . You 're anxious to get this over with ? I 'm anxious for different company . You don 't think much of me , do you ? You flatter yourself . I don 't think anything of you . You hired me to do a job . That 's where your significance ends . The rest is me and him . Come on . Let 's go . Mom ? You 're alone . Where is he ? Where is the stranger ? He 's gone . He left the valley . You lie ! He wouldn 't run . Why have you taken my son ? This whole thing has gone too far . Let 's put a stop to it now . Too late to stop it . I can 't have you in the valley anymore . Let my son go and we 'll leave . Too late for that too . You had your chance to go . Why didn 't you take it ? So what are you gonna do , murder us both like you murdered tark ? No . We 're not going to murder anyone . He is . I have something else you want-water . I 've seen your puny little well . I know where there 's a freshwater spring - an endless supply of uncontaminated water . Where ? Release my son and I 'll tell you . Cut the boy 's throat . No ! Where is the water ? It 's on my property . Where ? There 's a tunnel in the garden leading to it . Now , please , let us go . Perhaps . We 'll check the water first . Please . At least let my son live . I 've never seen you crawl before . It does my heart good . Well , enjoy it , you bastard . It may be the last thing you ever experience . Get back ! Tell him to release my son . You 'll never get away . You better hope I do . Otherwise , we 'll see the inside of your throat . Tell them . Tell them . Let the boy go . Run , jux . Run to town . Don 't stop and don 't look back . Go ! Now it 's our turn . Nobody sets a foot outside this tent . Get the boy ! Little bitch . Tie her up . You take that one and head him off . Come on . After him . Hurry up . He 's getting away . He 's losing her . Get up . Hey , let 's get the job done . Come here , you little bastard . - Does damnil want him dead or alive ? - Dead 's easy to carry . Pick him up . We 'd better stop him . What ? Stop him ! Come on . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Shit . Shit ! I told you not to play with sharp objects . They 've got my mom . Let 's go get her . Good boy . Good boy . Let 's go . Come on . Stay here . I 'll get her , jux . Get it over as quickly as possible . I knew you wouldn 't run . This time you brought a sword . That 's convenient . Luck . The same . Lann , stop them . I warned you not to interfere ! You 're the best competition I 've ever had . But no one is better than me . You talk too much . Get him . Now ! - Leave her . - She either lives or dies . It 's up to you . Why don 't you drop your swords ? Mom . Mom ! My swords . You were a commander . Why ? Why ... The dried up valley and a handful of peasants ? You forget an old man in a mountain tavern . Good morning , sir . Good morning . Morning . Morning . We 've come about the work . Good . We 're gonna be laying pipes . Bring water to the whole valley . Come with me . This is tooey . Hi . Hi . He 's my helper . My brother couldn 't come today . Will there still be work tomorrow ? Sure . Bring him along . I just hope you guys aren 't scared of work . We 're gonna be building ourselves a city . Just go on over there . Gonna miss old tark on this job . He was gonna get me a couple of pigs . Yeah . He sure would have been proud , wouldn 't he ? You 're leaving ? Damnil 's gone . There 's not much more I can do for you . You 've got your future . I don 't belong here . Somehow ... I knew you wouldn 't stay , but I hoped . You are ... The strongest person I have ever known . Build a good city . Wait ! Wait . I 'm coming with you . You have to teach me to be a soldier . You don 't want to be a soldier . I want to be like you and my dad . No . No , you don 't . You want to be like jux . You help your mother . Make this valley green . Will you come back ? When it 's time , I 'll be there . Deal ? Deal . Now , you hurry back . You 've got a lot of work to do .

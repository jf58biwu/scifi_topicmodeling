' - Where did your parents go ? - ( Wyatt ) Cincinnati . To meet the guy that my sister wants to marry . Chloe . Who the hell would marry Chloe ? He 's studying to be a vet . Try not to make a mess . The maid doesn 't come until Monday . How come your parents suddenly trust you ? They never let you do shit . Chet 's home from college . They trust him . He 's in charge . Chet ? Oh , shit ! I can 't believe this . I really wish you 'd told me that before I agreed to sleep over . - How do you put up with him ? - If I don 't he beats the shit out of me . It 's a habit he got in military school . ( Gary ) How do you put up with him ? ( Wyatt ) He 's very protective . Nice relationship ! 'Look , there 's nothing to fear . 'Note - no blood , no decay ... just a few stitches . 'Go on , fix the electrodes . 'You 'll be afraid before the night 's over . 'The storm will be magnificent .

' Gary Wallace , that 's absolutely gross . That 's sick . I 'm not digging up dead girls ... No , I 'm not talking about digging up a dead girl , Wyatt ! I 'm talking about your computer . ( Gary ) You can simulate stuff on your computer . You know ? What 's the difference ? Why can 't we simulate a girl ? I don 't know . I guess I could , but why ? It 's two dimensional on the screen . It 's not flesh and blood . I know that , but we can use it . We can ask it questions . We can put it in sexual situations . Sick , demented shit . You 'd love it ! What about your girl in Canada ? She lives in Canada . The girl has no morals ! Those kind of relationships are rough . Anyway . Get to work . Very nice . I told you , Wyatt . If there 's one thing I know , it 's female stats . Anything bigger than a handful , you 're risking a sprained thumb . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Perfect . - OK , now what ? Should we give her a brain ? - Yeah , we can play chess with her . - Chess ? Just give her a brain , OK . OK , that 's about all we can do with my stuff . I can 't believe this shit . I can 't believe this . - Did you get a free toaster with this ? - Gary , it 's smarter than you . The problem is this is a lame idea . It is not . Your computer is a wimp ! - We need more power than this . - What do you suggest ? ( Radio chatter ) ( Screams ) - We 're in . - We 're in trouble . This is illegal . ( Gary ) We need more .

If we 're going to have any fun together you guys had better loosen up . What are we going to do with her ? Look , we 'll just go with the situation , OK ? I 'm sure by Sunday you 'll think of something . You 're very bright . - You 're all right ? - I 'm just being practical . I know you are and I appreciate it . - Let 's go . - What about this mess ? Clean it up tomorrow , OK ? Don 't get any BO on Chet 's suit or he 'll kill me . - Where are we going ? - She said downtown ... Oh , my god ! Whose stuff is this ? Is that your suit ? Is this yours ? - Wyatt , what 's going on here ? - Gary , I don 't know . Gary , you look good though . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Did you steal this car ? - No , I didn 't steal the car .

You think of a name for me . - How about Lisa ? - Why Lisa ? Why not ? - He used to like a girl named Lisa . - Oh yeah ? Old girlfriend ? She kicked him in the nuts ! Will you shut up .

We don 't mingle , OK . Maybe you 'd be more comfortable if I invited all of these people to your house and we could all mingle there ? We 'll mingle . Hi , dudes . ( Men groan ) ( Gary ) Well , goddamn ! Listening to this blues music reminds me of my own trials and tribulations . My folks really dump on me . They really do .

Last year , I was insane for this crazy little 8th grade bitch . - Crazy insane ? - Insane ? I was nuts for the woman , man . You 've gotta believe me . I 'm telling the truth . I was nuts for the girl . What did it to me was these big titties she had . For a 13-year-old , she wouldn 't have to worry about titties for the rest of her life ! - She was set and looking good . - That 's the truth , baby . I called her every night for a month . I 'm talking devotion , man . - Every damn night ? - Every night , Mitch . ( Man ) On the telephone ? What 's he talking about " on the telephone " ? Explain it to him . Goddamn , we know there 's a telephone . But he hung up on her . The chick with those big titties ? I hung up on the bitch . Here 's the capper . Do you know what the bitch did ? - Lay it on . - Listen to what she did to me . She kneed you in the nuts and called him " faggot " . - She did what ? - Bitch kneed your nuts ? Bitch kneed my nuts . I 'm not playing with you . - In the family jewels ? - In the family jewels , man . - Worst pain there is . - Broke my heart in two . - She broke more than your heart ! - Yeah , you 're right there , baby . You can forget that other one because you 've got this fine jewel by you . Ain 't that the truth , baby . That 's the clean truth . There he goes ! - Party 's over . - ( Gary ) " Party 's over " , said the girl . I 'm going to get out of here . I 've got money for everybody . I 've got five bucks says that boy won 't make it . I really shouldn 't be driving . Listen , I appreciate it . I just don 't feel like driving . ( Whines ) OK , forget it . I 'll drive . Give me the keys . Give me the keys ! Is he going to be all right ? I don 't know . I warned him about that bourbon . Hey , he don 't even have a license , Lisa . I don 't even have a learner 's permit . Let 's scout another party , man . What are you going to tell Chet about me ? - Nothing . - That 's not very realistic , Wyatt . I don 't know . I 'm just trying to concentrate on the road . You 'd better concentrate harder . You 're about to run a red light . Oh , shit ! ( Gary ) I hate that blues shit . I never listens to it . - I hate this car . I hate it ! - Are you OK ? My nuts are halfway up my ass but other than that , I 'm perfect ! You better think what you 're going to do about Chet . He 's one serious idiot . You 're stewed , butt wad . - Who me ? - Know what time it is ? - 2 : 00 ? - Time to pay the fiddler . I was counting on you to be human about this . Here 's the bottom line , Wyatt . I 'm telling Mum and Dad everything . I 'm even considering making up some shit . All right , Chet . Name your price . 175 dollars and zero cents . Cash , new bills . Crisp and clean in my wallet by 7 : 00am . - Thank you . - Hey , what are big brothers for ! See you upstairs . Out of the " Jungle Book " . The booze hounds return . What a joke . Hi , girls . Feeling kind of queasy ? How about a nice greasy pork sandwich served in a dirty ashtray ? He pukes , you die . - He 's not laughing at you , Chet . - Yes , I am . Did he tell you about the woman we made tonight ? He doesn 't know what he 's talking about . - No shit ! - No shit , Chet . You two donkey dicks couldn 't get laid in a morgue . - You are absolutely right . - Get him out of here . What ? ( Retches ) Cold-blooded shit . He 's an asshole . Anybody with a haircut like that is an asshole . Psst ! Lisa . ( Whispers ) Where are you ? ( Whispers ) I 'm right behind you . Surprise . I 'm not going to hurt you . Your lips feel like rigor mortis has set in . Try and relax a little bit . I 'm only kissing you . I wasn 't expecting you to kiss me . I mean , I was just ... That was better . - Want to try it again ? - If you don 't mind . Yes , please . ( Wyatt whimpers ) - You sure you 're only 15 ? - I 'll be 16 in June . You made me . You control me . What are you thinking about ? Women 's gymnastics . Well , I don 't know . I 'll do my best ! Good . ( # MIKE OLDFIELD : " Tubular Bells " ) - Wyatt , where are you ? - I 'm right here , Gary . - What happened ? - I think it was a dream . - What ? - Everything . Last night . Lisa . The whole thing had to be a dream . It can 't be a dream , Wyatt . We were both in it . How can two people have the same dream ? - There 's no other explanation . - Let 's analyze this . In your dream , did I get up in the middle of the night and yak in your sink ? I didn 't throw up ? You didn 't see anything ? Maybe it was a dream . A very weird , bizarre , vivid , erotic , wet , detailed dream . - Maybe we have malaria . - Shit . ( Yells ) Gary . Wyatt . Breakfast . I don 't have the bucks to pay Chet off about this . ( Chet yells ) Yo , Wyatt ! You can 't fear Chet for the rest of your life . Why not ? Lisa , please . I don 't know , Wyatt . I mean , it 's seriously affecting your sex life . Ten seconds into my gymnastics routine , you passed out . You slept . I did my toes . By the way , you 're very cute . We 'll try it again some other time , OK . - Good morning , turd brain . - Hi , Chet . - You spit in this ? - Not that I 'm aware of , no . Hey , that looks pretty good . Now make yourself one , dickweed ! I like your panties . - It 's a joke , Chet . - That 's not a joke . That is a severe behavioral disorder . Those are women 's underpants . Next , you 'll be wearing a bra on your head ! The old man 's going to have a stroke on this one ! - All right , Chet . How much ? - How much ? ( Chet ) This goes way beyond payment , pal . Come one , Chet . Please . Well ... Your VCR should cover it , for openers . Thank you . For christsakes , will you cover yourself . Are you guys looking for something for your mum ? I really don 't think so , Sue . You guys have girlfriends ? One does really not refer to a 23-year-old woman as a girlfriend . Mistress , lover , sexpot . She 's a sexpot , is what she is . You guys are the ones that got beat up at the homecoming game , right ? Susan . Could you wrap up a bottle of this scent for me ? I like this . Two . And why don 't you set yourself up with one . Set yourself up . That 's three scents , please . If you were a 15-year-old boy , would these turn you on ? I think so , too . I 'll take them . Do you have a bra to match that ? Something in leather or rubber or barb wire ? Give me a break ! - Check it out . Check it out . - What ? - Five bucks ? - Finsky . Max , what are you going to do ? You know , Gary ? For the first time in my life , I don 't feel like a total dick . Yeah , me either . - Sorry , boys . - You guys getting tired of this ? We 're not , but there is a cure . Rumor has it there 's a big white sale going on . At Towel World . - We 're not impressed . - No . Could I have some of that , please . I 'm getting really bored of their shit . - Do you want to dump them ? - I don 't know . We have been with them for three months ... We won 't go to any more parties and meet more people . We 'll go into a social coma . - Sorry . - We 're sorry . - Want to give them another chance ? - OK . - Will you forgive us ? - Please . Oh , you guys ! What are we going to do with you ?

What can I do , you know ? By the way , there 's a party tonight at Wyatt 's house . You can find his name in the student 's directory . Under Donnelly . Pass the word around . Party ? ( Engine roars ) Don 't ask . You 're going to have a heart attack by the time you 're 40 if you don 't relax . You tried inversion boots ? Lisa , you don 't understand my parents . What 's there to understand ? They 're oppressive , meddlesome and bizarre . They 're normal parents . Stop worrying and go and get dressed . Lisa , I created you . Why do you insist on doing things I don 't want ? You want to party so bad you could bottle it . You and Gary want friends , popularity , all that stuff , right ? I thought about it , sure , but ... So I 'm giving it to you . Thank you , but I don 't want it in my house . If you want to be a party animal , you have to live in the jungle . Stop worrying and get dressed . I 'm going to go and pick up Gary . I can 't wait to meet his parents . Do you go to Gary 's school ? Do I look like I 'm in high school ? No . What it is , Dad , she 's a foreign exchange student . They have a different educational system . You look very ... mature . Doesn 't she ? It 's funny you say that because I was thinking the same thing . So what do you do for a living , Al ? I 'm an independent businessman . Al ... Dad . My dad 's a plumber . He 's into plumbing . I guess you plumb , right Dad ? - Yeah , I think it 's time to go . Ready ? - Where do you think you 're going ? - To a movie . - To a party . Movie party . We 're going to a movie party . He 's such a liar . I 've whipped up a soiree over at his friend Wyatt 's house . - Soirwhat ? - Soiree . I think that means party . Party . There 's going to be sex , drugs , rock ' n ' roll . Chips , dips , chains , whips . Your basic high school orgy type of thing . I 'm not talking candle wax on the nipples or witchcraft . No , no . Just a couple of hundred kids running around in their underwear acting like animals . ( Bellows ) All right , I 've heard enough ! Gary , get to your room . No , it 's OK . Just sit here . I 'll take care of this . Get the hell out of here before I throw you out . Don 't threaten me , Al . You 're out of shape . I 'll kick your ass . I 'm going to make this real easy for you . - I 'm taking Gary to a party . - Over my dead body . He 's a good kid . He studies hard . You 've got no complaints . If anyone should bitch , it should be Gary . ( Lisa ) You ever compliment him on his grades ? You ever compliment him on anything ? Hey . Look , Mum . Compliments embarrass me . - Dad , you know . - Shut up ! Have you ever wondered how sad it is that your son 's only sexual outlet is tossing off to magazines in the bathroom . Oh , Gary ! Ma , I never tossed off to anything . - You said you were combing your hair . - I was . Gary , shut up . - The water 's running all day long . - Shut up . - I 've never tossed off . - You wouldn 't tell your own mother . ( Yells ) Shut up . Shut up ! This guy deserves a party . I don 't know who you are , what you are , or where you came from , but I 'm not taking any more of this . Dial the police . Dial the damn police and give me the phone . Oh . I 'm going to get ... but ... - Give the phone . - Well , here it is . Jesus God . Oh , Christ . Oh , Lord . God . - Go ahead . - Make your day ? - I 'm sorry it has to come to this . - Come to what ? Cheer up or I 'll blow your face off . Don 't be such an old lady . Everything 's cool . ( Yells ) Everything 's cool ! My dad 's going to castrate me . My mother almost had a cardiac arrest . My parents will never let me in the house . Other than that , everything 's great . It couldn 't be better ! Trust me for once , will you ? They don 't know what happened . Didn 't you think Gary was acting strangely this evening ? Gary ? Who 's Gary ? Lisa , you have to promise me that things won 't get out of control . Don 't worry . You 're just having a few friends over . - I don 't have any friends , Lisa . - He doesn 't . Boy ain 't lying . ( Doorbell rings ) You do now . - Hi . - Hi ! - ( Man yells ) Party . - ( Crowd Chants ) Party , party !

If you 're going to float an air biscuit , let me know , OK ? Float a what ? If you 're going to fart , let me know . I 'll hit the fan . I 'm sorry . I suffer pan discomfort due to occasional stomach upset . I can 't believe this . I 'm so disappointed in us . We talk about how great it would be if we went to parties . It 's our party , people are having a great time , and we 're in the john ! We 're in the john . I can 't believe this . - You 're just as uptight as I am . - Nobody can be as uptight as you . Your middle name is tense . Wyatt " Tense Up " Donnelly . All right , this is true . It 's true . But it 's not that bad . We can hear the music . We can dance . If we put our noses to the door , we can smell the food ! Hey , brother . What 's happening , my main man ? Right on . Scotch . - Straight up ? - Nah , give me the whole bottle . Tell you what . You bend over and I 'll shove it straight up your ass ! On the rocks is fine . Yeah , that 's what I thought you were gonna say . - There she is . - You get the drinks , I 'll kill the girls . I wonder if Lisa is having a good time . Lisa could have a good time at an insurance seminar ! The thing that really galls me is that she 's ours and we can 't get close to her . ( Wyatt ) Hit the fan . - This is the best party I 've ever been to . - I know , it 's great . Do you know whose house this is ? I think it might be that girl with the English accent . That girl doesn 't have a zit on her whole body . Did you notice that ? - I know . And she has zero fat . - And she 's so relaxed . She burped and it was ... - Charming . - Yeah . - Yeah . - The bathroom . - Ladies . - Hi . ( Gary ) I can 't believe it . You 're dropping wolf bait and there are chicks outside . Light a match or something . Light a fire ! - Hi . - Hi . We 're sorry . We thought there were just girls in there .

What I meant was , what are you doing at the party ? - Oh , it 's my house . - This is your party ? Yeah , we like to do this once a week . Little get-togethers . Have you guys been by ? - How did we miss these two ? - So many people , so many parties . So many people , so many parties . You lose track . Would you mind if I came in and checked my face ? What 's wrong with your face ? - Can we come in ? - Come on in . - Yeah , be our guests . - Thanks , guys . Come on in . Well , we 've seen you guys at school but we 've never met . - You 're Hilly . - You 're Deb . - Hi , I 'm Gary . - I 'm Wyatt . This is a wild crowd . I didn 't know you guys had so many friends . - Yeah , neither did we . - Neither did we . Who 's the girl with the accent ? I though that this was her party ... You mean the sensuous , exotic , mature , sex symbol type ? - Yeah . - ( Gary ) She 's with us . She 's with you guys ? Come on , Lisa . Why not ? Because I belong to Gary and Wyatt . Belong ? Did they make you in the garage ? They own you ? Control you ? - ( lan ) Seriously ? - Seriously . They 're toads . Do I look like I 'd go out with two toads ? You do . It 's true . I think Gary and Wyatt are going to force everyone to redefine their terms . You 're completely loyal to them ? I do whatever they say . ( Jingling coins ) Could you excuse us for a minute , please ? That 's no problem . We 'll be in here . I think these ladies are stoked for us . - I got that feeling myself . - Shall we go for it ? - What about Lisa ? - She said party . Let 's get it on with these two , score points and go back to Lisa . - Or score points with these two later . - Sounds good . But I don 't want to hurt Lisa 's feelings . Any girl is looking for a bone job from me . - Ready to party down ? - Ten-four . Those guys are weird but kind of cute . And where did you two disappear to ? - We were in the kitchen . - Bathroom . - Peeing . - Doing our hair . Have you met Gary and Wyatt ? - No . - Sort of . If you get the chance , shower with them . I did . It 's a mind scrambler . It hurts so good . She took a shower with them . I have a wonderful idea , Henry . After dinner , why don 't we stop by and visit with Wyatt ? I hate to think of his being alone at home tonight . - Doesn 't he have anything to read ? - I don 't know , dear . But nothing 's more important to a teenage boy than his grandparents . - We 'll drop by . - Oh , good . ( # KILLING JOKE : " Eighties " ) # I 'm living in the eighties # Eighties ... # ( Cheering and clapping ) I 'd like to open up by apologizing for the Icee today at the mall . It was very immature and I 'm sorry . Well , it 's was just tomfoolery . But we are sorry . - It happens . - Yeah . So what 's the deal with Lisa ? Can we borrow her ? We can 't do that guys . Common decency prohibits us . It 's not cool . She said it was cool . We can 't take advantage of her loyalty . Sorry guys . That 's really selfish . That hurts . Forget it guys . We can 't do it . - Come on . Quit being such pricks . - Hey , come on . Regardless of what she told you , our feelings for Lisa run very deep . It 's emotions . Heavy emotions . Our feelings for Deb and Hilly run as deep as yours do for Lisa . It 's respect . It 's the time we spent together . A couple of guys like you deserve them . We like your style so we want to make a deal . You let us have a crack at Lisa and we 'll let you have Deb and Hilly . Can you guys keep a secret ? - Sure . - Secret ? - Look again . It 's Gary . - No . It 's our boy . Gary . He 's our 16-year-old boy ! I don 't know what you 're talking about , Lucy and I want you to shut up . ( Max ) I feel like an asshole .

In your race for power and glory you forgot one small detail . - We forgot to hook up the doll . - You forgot to hook up the doll .

There are motorcycles in my house . There are killer mutants in your house ! Screw the house . Argh ! You have uninvited guests . You better ask them to leave . They 're pretty rowdy . This is a chance for you to prove your bravery and courage . Those are outdated concepts , all right . Excuse us . Don 't let John Wayne hear you say that . The man is dead , Lisa . OK . So are you if you don 't deal with this situation . ( Glass shatters ) No thanks . Gary , do you feel like a chicken ? Wyatt , if I could shoot an egg out my ass , I would . What about all these people ? Won 't they think we 're cowards ? I don 't know . But we can deal with shame . Death is a deeper issue . ( Roaring ) ( Growling ) We 're going to get you guys some drinks . You look like a scotch man . We 're going to get some stuff ... Is this your party ? Well , yeah . Kind of . I don 't know if you would call it a party . It 's just a few friends . How come two unpopular dicks like you is having a party ? I don 't know . Unliked dicks sometimes do the weirdest things . How would you like all your friends here to know that you wear a bra on your head ? ( Laughter ) Tossed off to any good books lately ? You two can 't even take a shower with a beautiful woman without wearing your jeans . ( Uproarious laughter ) You . Come here . Now !

Let 's leave the girls out of this . I said , hands off . Now . ( Woman giggles ) Why don 't you shut up , bitch ! As for your ugly ass , let me tell you something . You don 't come into my friend 's house with your faggot friends driving all over his floors breaking windows , stinking up the place . And you do stink . Here 's what 's going to happen . You 're going to let go of the girls and apologize to all these people . And you 're gonna get on your bikes and pedal your asses out of here . We 're gentlemen , so we 'll give you a choice . Yeah , you can leave in peace ... ( Growls ) Or you can stay and die . The choice is yours . ( Shotgun shells clatter to the floor ) ( Growls ) Argh ! Get outta here . Beg your pardon . You have a lovely home . Terribly sorry . Call me . We 'll have lunch . Can we keep this between us ? I 'd hate to lose my teaching job . God bless you . Is everyone all right ? Everyone 's OK . This is exciting . We 're heroes . These guys came in and we showed them down . You and me , we saved all these people . We 're heroes . This could mean a guest shot on Phil Donahue . Gary . Where the hell did you get that thing ? It 's a squirt gun . That 's my boys ! Quite a weird night . You really weren 't afraid of those guys ? I was scared . But what could I do ? It 's probably a good idea not to ask too many questions about tonight . Probably . This is a night of weird shit . I was wondering if I could ask you something kind of strange . Would you kiss me ? What about lan ? We all make mistakes . - OK . - OK . Where do you want it ? - Can I ask you a question ? - Yeah . How do you feel about Lisa ? I love her . That 's what I figured . But ... It 's definitely a different kind of love . It 's more sisterly . Big sisterly . But she 's so beautiful . Yeah , she 's really beautiful . And her body is gorgeous . It 's a nice figure . So ... Then I ... I mean , what would I be compared to her ? Deb . Lisa is everything I ever wanted in a girl . Before I knew what I wanted . I know that if I could do it again , I 'd make her just like you . Honest . Dead honest . You know . I 'm really honest when I say that . I 'm so very honest . I mean that . ( # Military march plays ) What the hell ? That little bastard . Don 't let him have messed up my room . If my room 's OK , I won 't kill him . I 'll just hurt him real bad .

You die , she walks out of here with a severe limp . I 'll be back . It 's Wyatt 's older brother , Chet . He 's kind of an asshole . Oh , hi , Chet . What the hell is going on around here ? - Chet . I 'm sorry . It was an accident . - An accident ? Do you realize it 's snowing in my room , goddamit ! Some really weird shit happened , Chet . You don 't have to be a genius to figure that out , monkey dick . Start talking , little man . Gary and I were messing around with the computer Friday night . We made a woman and she messed up the house . - Don 't smart mouth me , you little shit . - Leave him alone . Stay out of this , bimbo . It 's a family matter . Let me find Lisa . She can explain everything . She 'll clear everything up . ( Murmurs ) You can have my college money . And my social security . So , you guys think you can pull one over on me , huh ? Huh ? You got everybody singing to the same bullshit story . This isn 't bullshit , it 's a Pershing missile , Chip . It 's Chet . My name is Chet . And I didn 't think it was a whale 's dick , honey ! ( Chet belches ) Hi , Nanny . Hi , Grampy . I 'm not a moron , you know . I ... Was that my grandparents ? - Are they dead ? - No . They 're just resting . - What are they doing in here ? - I put them in there . I didn 't want the boys to get into trouble . Quite frankly , they weren 't having a very good time at the party . ( Chet ) Not having a good time ! You think they enjoy being catatonic in a closet ? Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is ? Boy , I wouldn 't give a squirt of piss for your ass now . That 's enough . You guys , get the girls home . Wyatt , take the Porsche . Gary , you take the Ferrari . Ferrari ? I want to be alone with Chet here . - Good to see you again , Chet . - Get outta here . Take your little hussies home . Their parents are probably worried sick . Lady , I want to get to the bottom of this , ASAFP . So do I. First , I 'd like to butter your muffin . - Why are you such a wanker ? - Because I get off on it . I want you to promise that you will keep your big mouth shut about everything that has happened here . And I want you to treat Wyatt and Gary with dignity and respect . - Oh , really ? - Yeah , " Oh , really " . I can be a real serious bitch if I don 't get what I want . Hit me with your best shot . - How fast are you going ? - About 35 . ( Siren blares ) - This can 't be right . - Are you looking at the RPM 's ? No , I 'm looking at about 50 tickets ! Bye . - Oh , my ! - That was great . You son of a bitch . Al , that was Gary . Who is this Gary character ? I had a really great time last night . I 'll probably be grounded for a month or so but ... I 'll wait for you . ( Whimpers ) Hilly . I love you . All right . - I want to thank you for a great night . - Same here . Deb , I have kind of a confession to make . I 'm really not this cool . That 's not my car . This is not my suit . None of those people were my friends . Why are you telling me this ? Because I want you to like me for what I am . Whatever you are , I like it . I better get going . Wyatt and I still have to deal with Chet . Quit screwing around . This isn 't funny . You stupid bitch ! Careful , Chet . Don 't make me angry . Sorry . That 's better . Would you please turn me back to normal , please ? I haven 't done anything to you . But you 've done plenty to your brother . - Like what ? - Let me see ... You 've nagged him , harassed him , suppressed him , kept him in fear of you , extorted money from him ... It 's done out of love . Just for that , I ought to give you a set of elephant balls . ( Gasps ) Give me your word that you 'll leave Wyatt and Gary alone and I 'll change you back . Oh , all right . Shake on it , huh ? No thanks , I 'd rather not . Wait . Where are you going ? - I have to go and get changed . - What about me ? You 'll be fine . It 's takes a little while for the effect to wear off . - Well ? - I 'm in love . - It 's great , isn 't it ? - The best . I think things are turning around for us . - I mean it . - OK , what about Lisa ? We 'll have to talk with her . - Do you think she 'll understand ? - I think so . I mean , I sure as hell wouldn 't want to date you . You 're not my type ! ( Wyatt yells ) Chet . Chet ? Hi , dudes . I 'm sorry , Wyatt . I 'm sorry for being such a shit to you all these years . And I want you to know that I love you . Cack . - That 's nasty , Wyatt . - That 's Chet , Gary . ( Fly buzzing ) Oh my god . - ( Wyatt ) Lisa ? - In here . - Lisa ? - ( Lisa ) Yeah ? - You saw Chet ? - Yes , I did . - ( Wyatt ) Are you responsible ? - Yes , I am . Lisa , we can 't have him like that . It would ruin Christmas . He 's going to be fine in half an hour . He 's not going to spoil Christmas . He 's not going to bug you any more either . - Lisa , we have to talk with you . - What 's on your mind ? I really don 't know how to say this to you . You guys found girlfriends , right ? You fell in love with the two girls and they fell in love with you . - That 's all I ever wanted for you . - You 're not hurt ? Yeah , sure I 'm hurt . But I wouldn 't change it . I 'm just getting off seeing you two guys straightened out . I have to go . ( Lisa ) I 've had a wonderful time . Lisa . Bye . ( Low rumble ) ( Whooshing ) ( Hollers ) Boys . We 're home .

Just a couple of hundred kids running around in their underwear acting like animals . ( Bellows ) All right , I 've heard enough ! Gary , get to your room . No , it 's OK . Just sit here . I 'll take care of this . Get the hell out of here before I throw you out . Don 't threaten me , Al . You 're out of shape . I 'll kick your ass . I 'm going to make this real easy for you . - I 'm taking Gary to a party . - Over my dead body . He 's a good kid . He studies hard . You 've got no complaints . If anyone should bitch , it should be Gary . ( Lisa ) You ever compliment him on his grades ? You ever compliment him on anything ? Hey . Look , Mum . Compliments embarrass me . - Dad , you know . - Shut up ! Have you ever wondered how sad it is that your son 's only sexual outlet is tossing off to magazines in the bathroom . Oh , Gary ! Ma , I never tossed off to anything . - You said you were combing your hair . - I was . Gary , shut up . - The water 's running all day long . - Shut up . - I 've never tossed off . - You wouldn 't tell your own mother . ( Yells ) Shut up . Shut up ! This guy deserves a party . I don 't know who you are , what you are , or where you came from , but I 'm not taking any more of this . Dial the police . Dial the damn police and give me the phone . Oh . I 'm going to get ... but ... - Give the phone . - Well , here it is . Jesus God . Oh , Christ . Oh , Lord . God . - Go ahead . - Make your day ? - I 'm sorry it has to come to this . - Come to what ? Cheer up or I 'll blow your face off . Don 't be such an old lady . Everything 's cool . ( Yells ) Everything 's cool ! My dad 's going to castrate me . My mother almost had a cardiac arrest . My parents will never let me in the house . Other than that , everything 's great . It couldn 't be better ! Trust me for once , will you ? They don 't know what happened . Didn 't you think Gary was acting strangely this evening ? Gary ? Who 's Gary ? Lisa , you have to promise me that things won 't get out of control . Don 't worry . You 're just having a few friends over . - I don 't have any friends , Lisa . - He doesn 't . Boy ain 't lying . ( Doorbell rings ) You do now . - Hi . - Hi ! - ( Man yells ) Party . - ( Crowd Chants ) Party , party ! ( # LOS LOBOS : " Don 't Worry Baby " ) # Standin ' there by the window # Starin ' out at the night # You 've got so many troubles # On your nervous mind # But don 't worry baby # It 's gonna work out fine # You hear the sound of footsteps # Stealing ' cross the floor ... # ( Yelling and laughter ) - Yo . - How you doing ? - Where 's the bar ? - ( Yells ) Bar ? Do you think they will embarrass us tonight ? Yeah . Caviar ? If Max and lan see her it is all over for us . - How 's your stomach ? - It 's a little better . If you 're going to float an air biscuit , let me know , OK ? Float a what ? If you 're going to fart , let me know . I 'll hit the fan . I 'm sorry . I suffer pan discomfort due to occasional stomach upset . I can 't believe this . I 'm so disappointed in us . We talk about how great it would be if we went to parties . It 's our party , people are having a great time , and we 're in the john ! We 're in the john . I can 't believe this . - You 're just as uptight as I am . - Nobody can be as uptight as you . Your middle name is tense . Wyatt " Tense Up " Donnelly . All right , this is true . It 's true . But it 's not that bad . We can hear the music . We can dance . If we put our noses to the door , we can smell the food ! Hey , brother . What 's happening , my main man ? Right on . Scotch . - Straight up ? - Nah , give me the whole bottle . Tell you what . You bend over and I 'll shove it straight up your ass ! On the rocks is fine . Yeah , that 's what I thought you were gonna say . - There she is . - You get the drinks , I 'll kill the girls . I wonder if Lisa is having a good time . Lisa could have a good time at an insurance seminar ! The thing that really galls me is that she 's ours and we can 't get close to her . ( Wyatt ) Hit the fan . - This is the best party I 've ever been to . - I know , it 's great . Do you know whose house this is ? I think it might be that girl with the English accent . That girl doesn 't have a zit on her whole body . Did you notice that ? - I know . And she has zero fat . - And she 's so relaxed . She burped and it was ... - Charming . - Yeah . - Yeah . - The bathroom . - Ladies . - Hi . ( Gary ) I can 't believe it . You 're dropping wolf bait and there are chicks outside . Light a match or something . Light a fire ! - Hi . - Hi . We 're sorry . We thought there were just girls in there . It 's just us dudes . - What are you doing here ? - ( Wyatt ) Gary was just taking a shit . No , what I meant was ... What I meant was , what are you doing at the party ? - Oh , it 's my house . - This is your party ? Yeah , we like to do this once a week . Little get-togethers . Have you guys been by ? - How did we miss these two ? - So many people , so many parties . So many people , so many parties . You lose track . Would you mind if I came in and checked my face ? What 's wrong with your face ? - Can we come in ? - Come on in . - Yeah , be our guests . - Thanks , guys . Come on in . Well , we 've seen you guys at school but we 've never met . - You 're Hilly . - You 're Deb . - Hi , I 'm Gary . - I 'm Wyatt . This is a wild crowd . I didn 't know you guys had so many friends . - Yeah , neither did we . - Neither did we . Who 's the girl with the accent ? I though that this was her party ... You mean the sensuous , exotic , mature , sex symbol type ? - Yeah . - ( Gary ) She 's with us . She 's with you guys ? Come on , Lisa . Why not ? Because I belong to Gary and Wyatt . Belong ? Did they make you in the garage ? They own you ? Control you ? - ( lan ) Seriously ? - Seriously . They 're toads . Do I look like I 'd go out with two toads ? You do . It 's true . I think Gary and Wyatt are going to force everyone to redefine their terms . You 're completely loyal to them ? I do whatever they say . ( Jingling coins ) Could you excuse us for a minute , please ? That 's no problem . We 'll be in here . I think these ladies are stoked for us . - I got that feeling myself . - Shall we go for it ? - What about Lisa ? - She said party . Let 's get it on with these two , score points and go back to Lisa . - Or score points with these two later . - Sounds good . But I don 't want to hurt Lisa 's feelings . Any girl is looking for a bone job from me . - Ready to party down ? - Ten-four . Those guys are weird but kind of cute . And where did you two disappear to ? - We were in the kitchen . - Bathroom . - Peeing . - Doing our hair . Have you met Gary and Wyatt ? - No . - Sort of . If you get the chance , shower with them . I did . It 's a mind scrambler . It hurts so good . She took a shower with them . I have a wonderful idea , Henry . After dinner , why don 't we stop by and visit with Wyatt ? I hate to think of his being alone at home tonight . - Doesn 't he have anything to read ? - I don 't know , dear . But nothing 's more important to a teenage boy than his grandparents . - We 'll drop by . - Oh , good . ( # KILLING JOKE : " Eighties " ) # I 'm living in the eighties # Eighties ... # ( Cheering and clapping ) I 'd like to open up by apologizing for the Icee today at the mall . It was very immature and I 'm sorry . Well , it 's was just tomfoolery . But we are sorry . - It happens . - Yeah . So what 's the deal with Lisa ? Can we borrow her ? We can 't do that guys . Common decency prohibits us . It 's not cool . She said it was cool . We can 't take advantage of her loyalty . Sorry guys . That 's really selfish . That hurts . Forget it guys . We can 't do it . - Come on . Quit being such pricks . - Hey , come on . Regardless of what she told you , our feelings for Lisa run very deep . It 's emotions . Heavy emotions . Our feelings for Deb and Hilly run as deep as yours do for Lisa . It 's respect . It 's the time we spent together . A couple of guys like you deserve them . We like your style so we want to make a deal . You let us have a crack at Lisa and we 'll let you have Deb and Hilly . Can you guys keep a secret ? - Sure . - Secret ? - Look again . It 's Gary . - No . It 's our boy . Gary . He 's our 16-year-old boy ! I don 't know what you 're talking about , Lucy and I want you to shut up . ( Max ) I feel like an asshole . This had better work . This is just a blueprint , OK . You like it ? Bigger tits . - Go , go ! - Give them the knee shooters . ( Over radio ) What the hell 's going on up here ? Excuse me , Arthur . - It 's Art . - Excuse me , " Art " . ( Thunder rumbles ) Oh , shit ! ( Gasps ) - ' Where 's Eddie ? ' - ' He 's working on a new project . ' - ' Another invention ? ' - ' It 's something to do with a robot . ' ( Whooshing ) ( Woman giggles ) - ( Max yells ) Turn this thing off ! - You 're gonna love it . - How are you doing ? - I 'm shitting in my pants ! ( Tinkling piano keys ) It worked . You had to be big shots , didn 't you ? You had to show off . People will like you for what you are not for what you can give them . In your race for power and glory you forgot one small detail . - We forgot to hook up the doll . - You forgot to hook up the doll . ( Creaking ) ( Distant yelling and laughter ) Something is going on here , Carmen . I have a feeling we 're not going to approve , Henry . A missile . A missile ! - A missile in my house , Gary . - Yeah , this puppy 's for real all right . - It was an accident ... - Accident , my ass , Gary . My parent 's are coming home , Chet 's coming home . - They 're going to freak out . - They 're going to shit egg rolls . Get out . Scat . Out . You dirty tramps . You Hoosiers ! Guys , cut that out , would you . You ought to know better than to hit people with your Rex Harrison hat . This is my daughter 's home . Who the hell are you ? I 'm a very dear , close personal friend of your grandson 's . - Henry . Call the police . - I will . I 'll have you incarcerated . Here 's the deal , folks . Gary and Wyatt created me on their computer . I 'm not going to stand here and listen to this baloney . He won 't you know . He doesn 't stand for baloney . Do you mind waiting here ? I won 't be a moment . - Have you ever ... ? - Never . Excuse me . Wyatt , your grandparents are downstairs . OK , thanks . - Lisa . - Yes ? - Where are my grandparents ? - Wyatt , your kitchen is blue . - You want to try one ? - Where are my grandparents ? They 're all taken care of , OK . You 're gonna love this one . - Are they all right ? - They 're fine . In fact , they 're better than fine . They 're not ageing any more . ( Lisa ) See ? They 're smiling . Lisa , if any more of his relatives arrive we 'll be in the bathroom , OK ? That 's pretty sick . Those guys really need some self-confidence . A challenge . Something that will bring out their inner strength and courage . I 'm so bloody clever . Now . ( Engine revs ) ( Engine revs ) ( Man laughs manically ) This Bud 's for you . ( Growls ) - This party 's lame . - What about the girls ? Girls , scmirls ... ( Screams ) ( Yells ) Lisa , what 's going on ? ( Screams ) Gary . Gary , listen to me . There are motorcycles in my house . There are killer mutants in your house ! Screw the house . Argh ! You have uninvited guests . You better ask them to leave . They 're pretty rowdy . This is a chance for you to prove your bravery and courage . Those are outdated concepts , all right . Excuse us . Don 't let John Wayne hear you say that . The man is dead , Lisa . OK . So are you if you don 't deal with this situation . ( Glass shatters ) No thanks . Gary , do you feel like a chicken ? Wyatt , if I could shoot an egg out my ass , I would . What about all these people ? Won 't they think we 're cowards ? I don 't know . But we can deal with shame . Death is a deeper issue . ( Roaring ) ( Growling ) We 're going to get you guys some drinks . You look like a scotch man . We 're going to get some stuff ... Is this your party ? Well , yeah . Kind of . I don 't know if you would call it a party . It 's just a few friends . How come two unpopular dicks like you is having a party ? I don 't know . Unliked dicks sometimes do the weirdest things . How would you like all your friends here to know that you wear a bra on your head ? ( Laughter ) Tossed off to any good books lately ? You two can 't even take a shower with a beautiful woman without wearing your jeans . ( Uproarious laughter ) You . Come here . Now ! ( Growls ) ( Screams ) ( Screams ) - Prepare to die , Wyatt . - Gary , I can 't wait to die . - We are going to kick ... ... ass . OK . This is war . Hand off the girls . Let 's leave the girls out of this . I said , hands off . Now . ( Woman giggles ) Why don 't you shut up , bitch ! As for your ugly ass , let me tell you something . You don 't come into my friend 's house with your faggot friends driving all over his floors breaking windows , stinking up the place . And you do stink . Here 's what 's going to happen . You 're going to let go of the girls and apologize to all these people . And you 're gonna get on your bikes and pedal your asses out of here . We 're gentlemen , so we 'll give you a choice . Yeah , you can leave in peace ... ( Growls ) Or you can stay and die . The choice is yours . ( Shotgun shells clatter to the floor ) ( Growls ) Argh ! Get outta here . Beg your pardon . You have a lovely home . Terribly sorry . Call me . We 'll have lunch . Can we keep this between us ? I 'd hate to lose my teaching job . God bless you . Is everyone all right ? Everyone 's OK . This is exciting . We 're heroes . These guys came in and we showed them down . You and me , we saved all these people . We 're heroes . This could mean a guest shot on Phil Donahue . Gary . Where the hell did you get that thing ? It 's a squirt gun . That 's my boys ! Quite a weird night . You really weren 't afraid of those guys ? I was scared . But what could I do ? It 's probably a good idea not to ask too many questions about tonight . Probably . This is a night of weird shit . I was wondering if I could ask you something kind of strange . Would you kiss me ? What about lan ? We all make mistakes . - OK . - OK . Where do you want it ? - Can I ask you a question ? - Yeah . How do you feel about Lisa ? I love her . That 's what I figured . But ... It 's definitely a different kind of love . It 's more sisterly . Big sisterly . But she 's so beautiful . Yeah , she 's really beautiful . And her body is gorgeous . It 's a nice figure . So ... Then I ... I mean , what would I be compared to her ? Deb . Lisa is everything I ever wanted in a girl . Before I knew what I wanted . I know that if I could do it again , I 'd make her just like you . Honest . Dead honest . You know . I 'm really honest when I say that . I 'm so very honest . I mean that . ( # Military march plays ) What the hell ? That little bastard . Don 't let him have messed up my room . If my room 's OK , I won 't kill him . I 'll just hurt him real bad . ( Howling wind ) Freeze . - Chet . - Where 's my brother ? I don 't know . You 're dead meat , pilgrim . Chet . Chet . That 's her nose . Look , she has nothing to do with it . OK . You die , she walks out of here with a severe limp . I 'll be back . It 's Wyatt 's older brother , Chet . He 's kind of an asshole . Oh , hi , Chet . What the hell is going on around here ? - Chet . I 'm sorry . It was an accident . - An accident ? Do you realize it 's snowing in my room , goddamit ! Some really weird shit happened , Chet . You don 't have to be a genius to figure that out , monkey dick . Start talking , little man . Gary and I were messing around with the computer Friday night . We made a woman and she messed up the house . - Don 't smart mouth me , you little shit . - Leave him alone . Stay out of this , bimbo . It 's a family matter . Let me find Lisa . She can explain everything . She 'll clear everything up . ( Murmurs ) You can have my college money . And my social security . So , you guys think you can pull one over on me , huh ? Huh ? You got everybody singing to the same bullshit story . This isn 't bullshit , it 's a Pershing missile , Chip . It 's Chet . My name is Chet . And I didn 't think it was a whale 's dick , honey ! ( Chet belches ) Hi , Nanny . Hi , Grampy . I 'm not a moron , you know . I ... Was that my grandparents ? - Are they dead ? - No . They 're just resting . - What are they doing in here ? - I put them in there . I didn 't want the boys to get into trouble . Quite frankly , they weren 't having a very good time at the party . ( Chet ) Not having a good time ! You think they enjoy being catatonic in a closet ? Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is ? Boy , I wouldn 't give a squirt of piss for your ass now . That 's enough . You guys , get the girls home . Wyatt , take the Porsche . Gary , you take the Ferrari . Ferrari ? I want to be alone with Chet here . - Good to see you again , Chet . - Get outta here . Take your little hussies home . Their parents are probably worried sick . Lady , I want to get to the bottom of this , ASAFP . So do I. First , I 'd like to butter your muffin . - Why are you such a wanker ? - Because I get off on it . I want you to promise that you will keep your big mouth shut about everything that has happened here . And I want you to treat Wyatt and Gary with dignity and respect . - Oh , really ? - Yeah , " Oh , really " . I can be a real serious bitch if I don 't get what I want . Hit me with your best shot . - How fast are you going ? - About 35 . ( Siren blares ) - This can 't be right . - Are you looking at the RPM 's ? No , I 'm looking at about 50 tickets ! Bye . - Oh , my ! - That was great . You son of a bitch . Al , that was Gary . Who is this Gary character ? I had a really great time last night . I 'll probably be grounded for a month or so but ... I 'll wait for you . ( Whimpers ) Hilly . I love you . All right . - I want to thank you for a great night . - Same here . Deb , I have kind of a confession to make . I 'm really not this cool . That 's not my car . This is not my suit . None of those people were my friends . Why are you telling me this ? Because I want you to like me for what I am . Whatever you are , I like it . I better get going . Wyatt and I still have to deal with Chet . Quit screwing around . This isn 't funny . You stupid bitch ! Careful , Chet . Don 't make me angry . Sorry . That 's better . Would you please turn me back to normal , please ? I haven 't done anything to you . But you 've done plenty to your brother . - Like what ? - Let me see ... You 've nagged him , harassed him , suppressed him , kept him in fear of you , extorted money from him ... It 's done out of love . Just for that , I ought to give you a set of elephant balls . ( Gasps ) Give me your word that you 'll leave Wyatt and Gary alone and I 'll change you back . Oh , all right . Shake on it , huh ? No thanks , I 'd rather not . Wait . Where are you going ? - I have to go and get changed . - What about me ? You 'll be fine . It 's takes a little while for the effect to wear off . - Well ? - I 'm in love . - It 's great , isn 't it ? - The best . I think things are turning around for us . - I mean it . - OK , what about Lisa ? We 'll have to talk with her . - Do you think she 'll understand ? - I think so . I mean , I sure as hell wouldn 't want to date you . You 're not my type ! ( Wyatt yells ) Chet . Chet ? Hi , dudes . I 'm sorry , Wyatt . I 'm sorry for being such a shit to you all these years . And I want you to know that I love you . Cack . - That 's nasty , Wyatt . - That 's Chet , Gary . ( Fly buzzing ) Oh my god . - ( Wyatt ) Lisa ? - In here . - Lisa ? - ( Lisa ) Yeah ? - You saw Chet ? - Yes , I did . - ( Wyatt ) Are you responsible ? - Yes , I am . Lisa , we can 't have him like that . It would ruin Christmas . He 's going to be fine in half an hour . He 's not going to spoil Christmas . He 's not going to bug you any more either . - Lisa , we have to talk with you . - What 's on your mind ? I really don 't know how to say this to you . You guys found girlfriends , right ? You fell in love with the two girls and they fell in love with you . - That 's all I ever wanted for you . - You 're not hurt ? Yeah , sure I 'm hurt . But I wouldn 't change it . I 'm just getting off seeing you two guys straightened out . I have to go . ( Lisa ) I 've had a wonderful time . Lisa . Bye . ( Low rumble ) ( Whooshing ) ( Hollers ) Boys . We 're home . Hi , Mr. Donnelly . How are you ? - Dad , hi . - No , no . ( Woman ) So , what did you guys do this weekend ? - Not much . - Just hung around the house . Dad had this crazy notion you might throw a party or do something nutty . - Not us . - Not here . No way .

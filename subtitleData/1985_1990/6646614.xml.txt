You got 200 patents . 212 . Listen , I won 't be able to spend very much time with you This weekend . Abandoned for bioelectronics . Story of my life . Well , George will keep me company . We 're coming to the end of the tests on the biometer . I think we may have something . You always have something , Daddy . But tell me . Who 's the we ? Julie .

Killer alley cats to good natured house pet , You 've had complete personality reversals . It 's astounding . I won 't take risks , not with human lives . It 's a remarkable achievement . Edward , you 're too modest . Apache is the most powerful machine ever constructed . And I feel privileged to be part of your team . And a very important part of it . WOMAN : What an incredible house . This way , ladies . Hello , Mary Rose the maid , and this is Harry the butler . Please , make yourselves at home and relax . Just relax . Thanks for the sales pitch , but the answer 's still no . No humans . Not yet . So you 'll only let the biometer cure neuroses in house Cats and junkyard dogs . EDWARD : No humans till I 'm ready . Edward , the whole world is waiting . Think of all those paranoids , schizophrenics . It 's criminal to waste anymore time . One more game , George . Skill four . Ready when you are . Oh , so someone else has access to Apache . Someone 's charming daughter . Oh , god , I forgot to turn off Apache . Darling , when you use George , make sure he Not connected to Apache . Eh ? OK .

I can 't hear you , Julie . [ Barking ] The subject of this experiment is a highly nervous , aggressive Doberman trained to kill . After ingestion of the ball , the animal should behave normally . The attempt is to modify or reverse character disorders . [ Barking ] EDWARD : It 's transforming . It 's alive . I changed the dose . Now , remember , Julie , whatever you do , Don 't let the biometer go beyond 50 % . I don 't want a crazed dog or even a dead one on our hands . We 've dramatically reduced the time Required for the synthetic neurons to short out And replace the natural ones . It only takes a few milliseconds . I knew it . I knew it . I knew you 'd do it . It 's fantastic . Well , it all looks pretty good now , But what about possible long term effects ? What about six months from now ? Do you still think that loss of inhibitions and suppression Of fear is dangerous ? I just don 't know . It 's working beautifully . The dog 's behavior has completely changed . Hey , I 'm expecting a phone call , OK ? [ Laughing ] That was my seat . Uh , if you , uh ... if you want it , that 's OK . You can have it . Oh , god . [ All laughing ] You 're really very good . Ever think about turning pro ? What about you , huh ? Don 't you want to take on the pinball wizard ? You kidding ? She doesn 't know a god damn thing about it . How 's everything going ? Everything 's fine . The tests on the dog worked perfectly . Did the guinea pigs arrive ? Yeah , they 're here . What about Brake ? He 's never a problem . He doesn 't suspect a thing . You know you 've only got this weekend . No mistakes . If it wasn 't for me , you wouldn 't even know about this . And for that kind of money , I don 't make mistakes . Yeah , just remember that . This is rough . Eating , drinking , never lifting a finger . Sure beats being cooped up in a shop With a bunch of teenagers playing disco music . Ah , you mean you work in a record store ? I 'm a singer . Or at least , I 'm gonna try to be one . Well , why don 't you stop by the shop And use some recording equipment ? Maybe I 'll produce your demo . I can just see the headlines now . I love it . Weekend meeting leads to solid gold . Oh ! [ Laughing ] Diary , George . [ Whirring ] George , I need some info . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . GEORGE : More data , please . I feel so strange . GEORGE : Butt out , Apache . This is private . I feel weird . I feel like laughing and crying . Paradox . I never felt this way before . I need information . Aw . It 's like a hole in my stomach . My heart too . I swear , it 's beating faster . Aw . I don 't think it 's a heart attack . And it 's not the flu . I 'm not sick , George . I 'm cold , hot , up , down . I 'm happy . Do you understand ? More data , please . When I looked at him , it felt like an electric shock . Just like that , I got all wound up inside .

[ Beeping ] GEORGE : Diagnosis ... in love . You are in love . JESSICA : That 's it ! They 're all at the pool . I need a personal object from each one of them , Something they won 't miss . Well , I 'll get on it fast . Ma 'am . I feel badly . You 're here and I 'm spending all my time with Apache . Professor , I am deeply insulted . I know how hard it 's been since Mom died . You had to do everything , be my mom and dad . I just want you to know that I realize what A wonderful father you are . I 'm sorry I haven 't been ... What other dad would have given me George ? Remember when I was five , he ... You taught me how to program ? Who are you ? Maintenance . Well , maybe you can help me . You can never get what you want . Not exactly a conventional childhood , was it ? I wouldn 't trade it . Is something bothering you , Dad ? It 's the experiments . They 're moving so fast . Julie seems to be in such a hurry . Don 't let her push you . Well , fortunately , she still needs me . She can 't do it without me . [ Music playing ] MAN : Here 's your special sandwich , Ralph . ( WHISPERING ) Wait here . Relax . [ Music playing ] Slow down . Don 't slip the clutch , honey . Relax . [ Beeping ] George to Apache . Abort program . Insufficient data . Confirm response . Test connection faulty .

Not even for me ? It 's important to my future . Our future , if it works out right . That 'll be $ 6 . I 'll tell you what . I might get into trouble . But I 'm gonna leave a little later , OK ? That 'll give us some more time . I 'll have to stop by and tell my dad that I 'll be away . Look , I 'm telling you I haven 't seen him . We had a date here , too , and I 'm getting tired of hanging Around waiting for him . Shit . I forgot my helmet . Doesn 't have his own ? Yeah , well , you 've got your own bike .

It can destroy them , turn them into neuropaths . You could ruin everything we 've worked on for years . You got here too soon , Edward . Why are you doing this to the project ? To all of us ? It looks like you sold me out . Get out of here . You 're fired . [ Grunts ] Daddy . Daddy ? Are you there ? [ Door opening ] [ Struggling ] [ Crying out ] [ Humming ] Julie , you scared me .

Not Daddy . Not him . He couldn 't want this . I know how you feel , Jessica . I really do . But you never know what he 's thinking . You know that . I don 't believe it . You 're lying . Ask Ken if you don 't believe me . It 's not possible . Someone please tell her it 's not true . Unfortunately , it 's both possible and very true . You bitch . You 're not satisfied with creating these . You 've tried to turn my child against me . And I trusted you with everything . Don 't be stupid , Edward . After all this , now I 'm giving the orders . The tapes are already in San Jose . Well , if you 've finished playing out your little melodrama , I 'll leave now . I have a lot of work to do .

 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Dallas , you look so lovely in that dress . Thank you , Miss Bronte . And how is my little princess ? - Do I have to go ? - Yes , honey . You 'll be fine . Well , what have we here ? Let 's have a look at you . Go on . I 'll have a treat for you when we get back . You 're so pretty , baby . So pretty . I 've been around the world but never off the planet . You Newcomers drive me wild . Come on . GEORGE : What is going on ? Uncle Moodri , wait . GEORGE : What is going on ? Uncle Moodri , wait . Wait , stop . We are having a party tonight . What are you doing ? The reclining platform should face southeast , toward the galaxy Centaurus . The reclining platform should face that wall toward the fireplace . Your house is in disorder . I am come to make it right . " Great Father Powhatan , spare the life of Capt. John Smith . - " Or if blood is to be shed , let it be mine . " - What is this ? I 'm rehearsing for the school play , Pocahontas . That 's very nice , sweetie . [ Goat bleating ] You are going to have to get rid of your pets before the neighbors complain . They 're not his pets . They 're his companions . There were two pounds of gopher in the refrigerator . Anybody seen it ? Vegetables are pure , meat pollutes . They should be kept separate . We 're keeping them in the closet next to the washing machine . No , we are not . This is my house and I say where things go . What do you mean , this is your house ? On the ship , the Overseers treated us as property to be bought and sold . Does your mind look on this world like the mind of an Overseer ? Tonight we are having people I work with over for dinner . The idea is for them to see how alike we are to humans ... whose reclining platforms do not face the galaxy Centaurus . " Great Father of Powhatan , spare the life ... . " I am going to work . GRAZER : Case of William Campbell , shot and critically wounded ... in what appears to be a gang-related incident . This case is a political hot potato . Campbell 's black and his assailant is a Newcomer . Now , I 've got to assign detectives to the case ... . The choice is simple , Captain . I should be assigned the case ... to demonstrate that I am not biased by my species . And to also demonstrate that the department serves the entire community ... and it is in the large sense truly colorblind . That 's sweet , George , but naive . Dobbs , case is yours . This is a priority investigation . If Dobbs needs any help , you 're at his disposal . You 're coming to the barbecue tonight , aren 't you , Matt ? You asked me that every day for the last week . Yes , I 'm coming to your barbecue . Dobbs and Marcus haven 't given me a firm answer . I do think an evening like that would help build a sense of unity , don 't you ? - What 's with the foot ? - Tension . You get sore necks , we get sore feet . It 's my home life . Tell me . What did you think of Alien Heart ? That tape I loaned you . It 's the first movie in which Newcomers are given meaningful roles . I only had a chance to watch half . My aunt called from Phoenix . Do me a favor , put those shoes back on . GEORGE : Look at your movies . Sex Team , Kittens in Heat . Your culture puts a very high priority on the physical . Name one that doesn 't . In ours there 's more integration with the mental and the spiritual . A strictly physical relationship is foreign to us . No male would want it . No female would accept it . I thought Alien Heart expressed this well . George , do you want to know the truth ? - Alien Heart is a bore . - A bore ? - A bore . That 's why I didn 't watch it . - Alien Heart ? - A bore . That 's why I didn 't watch it . - Alien Heart ? - Yeah ! - Eleanor Roosevelt is boring ? is that the one that kind of looks like a chipmunk ? She is beautiful and brilliant . She 'll be the first Newcomer to win the Academy Award , you 'll see . Andarko . Now , you get that money back , or you 're dead . Hey , you ! Stop ! Are you all right ? You okay ? It 's all right , we 're police . MATT : Easy , easy , easy . He had salt water . He was going to burn me . Okay ? - Do you know that man ? - No . I lost him . He 's gonna come back . He 's gonna kill me . You don 't know him , but you know he 's going to come back . - What 's your name ? - Mary . Mary Shelley . Mary , do your parents know you 're out working the streets ? Working the streets ? What are you talking about ? - Come on . - What do you mean ? She 's a hooker , George . That guy was her pimp . - A prostitute ? - Yeah . I can 't believe that . She is Tenctonese . You 've seen Newcomer hookers before . Come on . Wait . is it true ? Are you a prostitute ? Satisfied ? Mary , where do your parents live ? My parents ? A place called San Diego . It is not safe on the streets . I want you to go home to your parents . Do you have bus fare ? Mary , I am going to give you $ 50 ... to buy a bus ticket back home to your parents . Very smart , George . Giving a hooker money , that 's very smart . Mary , the bus . - l don 't know how . - She 's nuts , George . No . She is ... . She has no self . She is still a slave . I have heard of this but I have never seen this . Matt , I want you to take her home , clean her up and put her on that bus . - What the hell are you talking about ? - She can 't function by herself . All her life she has been controlled by someone . The Overseers on our slave ship and now her pimp . She is unable to think for herself . - We can 't leave her out here . - Then we 'll take her to juvie hall . She is helpless . You know what they would do to her there . Well , then you take her home . I would but I ... . My kids , my uncle , his goat ... . You live five minutes from the bus station . George , we 're police , we 're not social workers . Matt , you have a daughter her age . Would you want her to go to juvenile hall ? Oh , jeez . All right. I suppose Susan will have to understand . Okay , I 'll take her . You have 20 minutes to get yourself cleaned up . This prostitution . We never had such a thing until we came here . - Matt , do you ever pay for sex ? - No ! Well , you know , once or twice when I was young . What are you asking me questions like that for ? Okay . Here 's a towel and some soap . Guess you don 't need any aftershave . Shower 's in there . Wait a minute . What are we going to put you in ? Hi , Cathy . Look , do you have an old dress that you don 't want anymore ? It 's for her . Cathy , this is Mary . Mary , Cathy . I 'll check . Did you call your folks ? Okay , right . There 's your bus . Here 's your ticket . Give this to the bus driver and he 'll tell you where to get off . Wait a minute . What , no thank you ? No nothing here ? Thank you . Wait a minute . Collar is crooked . - Are you gonna be okay ? - Yeah . - Sorry I 'm late . - Thank you . - Where 's everybody ? - Alfred had to work . I guess the others all got caught in traffic . Unless they 're all a bunch of party poops . - Poopers , George , party poopers . - Whatever . My feet are killing me . Dad , Matt , guess what ? I got a part in the school play . Emily is doing Pocahontas in the school play . - That 's great . - Yeah , and did you see Eleanor Roosevelt ... in Alien Heart ? I 'm going to be just like her . Here , take this to the table . - Hi , Susan . - Matt . You 're the first one here . I suppose we should go ahead and eat . There is no telling when the others will get here . [ Goat bleating ] Okay . Good , then . I 'll just take this to the table . - Dinner , everyone . - The barbecue is out here . I wasn 't sure how long to cook the hamburgers . Do you think one hour is enough ? One hour ought to do it . [ Goat bleating ] - Growing your own food ? - They are Uncle Moodri 's companions . Looks like your friends aren 't going to show . It 's bumper to bumper out there . They 'll be here . Uncle Moodri . This is my partner , Matthew Sikes . Matt , Uncle Moodri . Hi ! I see why your feet hurt . [ Praying in alien language ] - This something new ? - No , very old . Uncle is a pre-Celinist . His belief is based on the matriarchal system . The Goddess Ionia is our mother . The universe is her womb . All things come from the mother , all things return to the mother . As you can see , women play a significant role in this religion . You 'd have no trouble converting my ex-wife . So , Matt , did Mary make it on the bus all right ? - Just hope her family takes her back . - Why wouldn 't they ? Mary 's been in a little bit of trouble . It 's all right . In this house sex is discussed openly . - Mary is a prostitute . - What 's a prostitute ? This broccoli is delicious . That 's someone who has sexual relations for money . I thought that was the gift you gave somebody when you loved them . I know , it 's confusing , Emily . Well , Matthew 's been with a prostitute . Perhaps he can explain . Well , as I told George , your father ... this particular incident happened when I was quite young . This girl told me ... her mother was very , very sick and I gave her some money . That 's all . A woman is sacred . - Buck . - They treat us like things . They even treat their own kind like things . Mary is a Newcomer . You see ? First they take away our identity . Then our soul 's polluted . - We have nothing left . - So , could I have some more salad , please ? Well , I don 't want to be a prostitute . I want to be an actress . Mary , what are ... . Why aren 't you ... . Come on . Dorian , remember that girl you were looking for ? MATT : All right , so what 's going on ? - l don 't have any place to go . - What about your parents ? I don 't have parents . I was taken away from them when I was a baby . Look , Mary , you can 't stay here . You can sleep on the couch tonight ... but tomorrow I have to take you to the Juvenile Division of Newcomer Affairs . That 's my daughter . She was about eight then . Look , you can sleep in this tonight . Good night . BOY : He shot Campbell , man ! He shot Campbell ! [ Newcomer speaking in alien language ] Fear no more , Finiksa . - ls it time to go ? - You need some breakfast . I live by myself , I don 't have a lot on hand . - You want some peanuts ? - Yeah . There you go . I got some instant coffee , maybe you 're too young . Peanuts are fine. I like peanuts . That guy with the salt water . What happened ? I stole money . My boyfriend told me to . - From your pimp ? - The man I was sent to . - Where 's the money now ? - My boyfriend took it and he went away . Oh , Mary . You 've gotta give that money back . They 'll kill you . You don 't understand the streets . There are laws. I know , I 've been there . Look , I gotta go to work now . You stay put . Keep the door locked , don 't let anyone in ... and when I get back , we 'll figure out something . Here , you can watch Alien Heart while I 'm gone . Alien Heart ? Can you put it in ? I want to see it . - Okay , see you later . - Wait , can you make it go fast ? Stop it here . Look , that 's my friend . Dallas . We have the same agent . - Agent ? - lsn 't she beautiful ? Yeah , she 's real pretty . Okay , keep the door locked . Wait . Thank you . George , look , I 'm really sorry I missed your barbecue last night ... but I was working on this hot lead on the Campbell case . - Sure. I understand . - Really ? You know , we found a piece of Newcomer skin at the scene of the crime . One of them had salt water thrown on him . I didn 't know you guys were tissue typed during quarantine . They 're running a make right now . That 's great . Congratulations . GEORGE : I suppose they all had legitimate reasons for not coming to the barbecue . George , Mary 's back . She doesn 't have any parents . And this guy 's going to kill her ... if she can 't come up with some money in a hurry . I had no idea it would be so complicated . Or perhaps you were right . We should turn her over to juvenile hall . Come on , juvie hall is the last thing she needs . She needs a home . Problem is , there ain 't a big adoption market for 16-year-old hookers . Look , Matt . Perhaps we can take her in for a few days . George , this kid 's like an eggshell , breakable . Can 't keep moving her around . Besides , she 's used to me . - What are you saying ? - She 's used to me . I know what she likes for breakfast . Excuse me. I 'm looking for my little sister , Mary . Mary Shelley . Yes , we 've met . She told me to pick her up at this address ... but she didn 't give me the apartment number . It 's 203. I 'll let you in . [ Speaking in alien language ] The great God Ionia is with us . This is her sign . - Here she will speak . - How do you know ? There was a place like this on our planet . I was a little boy . - My father took me there . - What was it like , our home ? Blue . The deepest and most peaceful blue . A silver mist . Meadows full of a thousand stars . You are sad , Finiksa . Something happened . I don 't know what to do . Can you tell me ? Come with me , here . It 's in the sea , Uncle . The salt water will kill us . Buck , Mom wants you . She needs you to go to the store . How did you know ? What 's that ? It 's a place I 'm going to with Uncle . Mary ? Mary ! Some guy was selling these things on the street , and I thought I 'd ... . Mary ! Oh , God . He 's not here . I 'm so sorry , Matt. lt 's all my fault . No , it isn 't . I let him in . She 'd be alive right now if I hadn 't let him in . It 's not your fault . May I go ? Yeah . I never should have taken her in . I should have left her on the streets where she belonged . Matt . I 'm going to nail the son of a bitch who killed her . Gonna nail his ass . I don 't think we should take this investigation . You are emotionally involved . It makes for bad police work . I , too , am horrified by her death . But if taking Mary in was an error in judgment , let 's not make another . You didn 't come home and find that girl lying dead on your floor . I 'm on this case . You don 't like it , put in for a new partner . Great Chief Powhatan , I beseech you . No father has shown his daughter more love . No daughter has ever been happier . You have fed me , taught me and protected me . It is you who gave me eyes to see the good in this world . To know the pure heart from the evil . Father , look into this man 's heart ... and see the goodness there . Great Father Powhatan ... - You all right ? - ... hear your daughter 's cry . Spare the life of Capt. John Smith . Let 's nail that son of a bitch . The man who produced Alien Heart filmed it here . I just imagined some big studio in Hollywood . You know George , Alien Heart ain 't exactly Gone with the Wind . Harry Marcus ? LAPD . We 'd like to ... . - Come here . - l don 't have it ! I 'm broke . You can 't squeeze money from a stone . You tell her that . - What the hell are you talking about ? - The alimony . She 's got everything. I have nothing . I 'm living out of my car . I don 't care about any alimony . What 's the use ? They pulled the plug on my picture. I have no future ! Will you shut up ! We just want to ask you some questions . Okay . You can 't imagine the hell she 's been putting me through . There was an actress in Alien Heart . A Newcomer named Dallas . Where can we find her ? I don 't know . My ex-partner , Mr. Casting Couch , he handled the Newcomers . Want a drink ? I 've got some sour milk in the car . No , thank you . Been in the sun a couple of days . How did your partner go about finding girls ? From the Bronte Agency . I remember because he was always saying how cooperative they were . You guys scared the hell out of me . Cooperative ? Easy . They put out . Where 's this guy from ? Outer space ? Easy . You don 't mean Eleanor Roosevelt . Thanks for your help . Can 't believe that . Eleanor Roosevelt ? Hi ! I 'm Bennett Hart . This is my partner , Huey Long . We 're producing the movie Butterfly Road . It 's kind of a sequel to Cocoon 3 . We have an appointment with Miss Bronte . Bennett Hart and Huey Long to see you , Miss Bronte . BRONTE : Send them in . - What 's with you ? - lt 's my feet again . Relax , we 'll be fine . Hello. I 'm Charlotte Bronte . - You must be Mr. Long . - Yes . How do you do ? - Mr . Hart . - Hi . Refresh my memory , Mr. Long . What was your last picture ? Pocahontas . The love story . Retold from a Tenctonese point of view . " Father , look into this man 's heart , and see the goodness there . " Great Father Powhatan , hear thy daughter 's cry . " - l don 't think I caught it . - lt 's not out yet . Christmas . Well , my book is there . I 'm sure you 'll find a number of fine actresses . I 'm very proud of my girls . Please , have a look . - Did you have a certain type in mind ? - Young , attractive . I 'm afraid that describes all of them . My friend , Harry Marcus , the producer of Alien Heart ... mentioned that you might have some special girls ... girls who are ... . You know . [ Speaks in alien language ] Excuse me. I 'm embarrassed . I think we 've come to the wrong place . Wait . You understand I have to be discreet . Naturally , these girls will be more expensive . How about this one ? I 'm sorry. I should 've taken that one out . She 's no longer with our agency . This girl is good-looking . Yes , I like her . Dallas . Yes . And I believe she 's available . [ Speaking in alien language ] DOBBS : Hold it right there . - Svabo ? - Yeah ? Detective Sgt. Dobbs . You 're under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . If you give up that right ... anything you say will and can be used against you in a court of law . [ Light jazzy instrumental music playing ] [ Doorbell buzzing ] Hi. I 'm from the Bronte Agency . Come in . Dallas , right ? I 'm Huey Long . Would you like to have a seat ? I 've heard a good deal about you . You 're very talented . Thank you . I was wondering if you might do for me what you did for my friend ... Harry Marcus . Miss Bronte said this was going to be straight up . Half and half will cost you extra . $ 500 . is that enough ? Okay . Police . You 're under arrest . - l 'm sorry , Dallas . - Sure . It 's not as bad as all that . If you help us , we will drop the charges . - No . - Your friend , Mary , she 's dead . We need you to help us find her killer . You 're lying . Uncle , are you sure it 's safe to go that close to the ocean ? Now we go . Campbell says Svabo is not the Slag who shot him . Now we get Svabo to finger the guy ... and I 'm going to make the collar of my lifetime . Every reporter within 100 miles is going to be there watching me play Dick Tracy . Then you see if I don 't make lieutenant . You 're in deep , kid . Look , I didn 't do it. lt wasn 't me , man . Who ? Who was it that shot Campbell ? is she wired ? Feels funny . This Dorian Grey , he handle all the rough stuff ? Charlotte uses him to keep us in line . Like , if a girl 's holding back , she sends Dorian . Right . Dallas ... we have got to connect Charlotte with Dorian . We think that Charlotte had him kill Mary over some money she stole . Now , we 're going to make Charlotte very angry with you ... but I don 't want you to be frightened . We 'll be close by , and we 'll be able to hear everything that goes on . All right ? Yes , I spoke to Dallas . She told me everything went well . Yes . She was excellent . Did she tell you about the party ? No . She didn 't mention anything . That 's odd . We negotiated the price . Anyway , I 'm having her and friends of hers attend a party . Some investors from New York . I 'm sure she 'll let you know . Yes , I 'm sure she will . Goodbye , Mr. Long . Dorian , I need you . BRONTE : Yes . receptionist : Dallas is here , Miss Bronte . Send her in . Dallas , dear . This is from Mr. Long . Thank you. ls something wrong ? No , I 'm tired , I guess . BRONTE : Of course . Did you and Mr. Long make any other plans ? No . Really ? Well , that 's too bad . I thought you would hit it off . Well , c 'est la vie . I 've made arrangements for you to have another date . This afternoon . This afternoon ? Actually , you don 't have much time . My driver will take you . Please send Nat in . - Drive Dallas to this address , please . - Yes , ma 'am . - Thank you , Miss Bronte . - Don 't be silly . Hurry now . Hello , Dallas . DALLAS : Dorian . Stay close , Matt . Pretty Dallas . Stupid Dallas . You know what happens to girls who rip off Charlotte ? I don 't know what you mean . Say it , you bastard , say it . Your little party with that producer . I was going to tell her . That 's it . Let 's pull her out . Damn ! - Watch it ! - Move that thing ! Move it ! What are you doing ? This is called chicken , George . 90 % of the time they get out of the way . That leaves 10 % . Out of the way ! You killed Mary , didn 't you ? That 's right . And I 'm going to kill you , too if you don 't learn . That 's it . Let 's get him . Here 's a little reminder . A taste of the blue Pacific . [ Dallas and Dorian screaming ] You 're wired . You 're dead . Come on , try it ! Please . - l 'm okay . - lt 's all right . [ Speaking in alien language ] You 're under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . - lf you give up that right anything- - - What the hell do you think you 're- - You take innocence , you sell it , and you destroy it . - What ? - She has the tattoo . She is ... . An Overseer . One of those who kept us slaves on the ship . Don 't worry about it , George . She 's in for life ... and that don 't begin to pay the bill . George ... I 've got some bad news . The kid we arrested ... he identified the Newcomer who shot Campbell . It 's your son . My son ? Buck . I 'm sorry , man . It 's a mistake . We gotta bring him in . I 'm really sorry , man . Wait . Let me . Sure . [ Speaking in alien language ] Will it ? - How ? - l am part of it . It is part of me . Come , Finiksa . Believe that and the water can 't hurt you . I 'm not you , Uncle. I don 't have your faith . There is no shame in that . Shame is for those who remain blind to themselves . I don 't know where l belong ... or who I am . With each breath , you join this earth . You 're saying I belong here ? I hate this world . All worlds are stardust . This world , our world , we are stardust . Scattered , drifting ... yet united by one voice . The voice that tells a leaf to turn to the light ... the flowers to bloom . It speaks to you , too . - l don 't hear it . - l know . You carry a wound ... and until that wound is cleansed , you will not be able to hear the voice . You know about the shooting . That 's why you came . I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . I didn 't want to do it . Uncle ... help me . Finiksa , this is your world . Embrace it . Take responsibility for what you do here . Face your wrongdoing with honor and you will hear the voice . There are many to help you , many who love you . Buck . Dad , I 've done a horrible thing . I have to go to the police . JUDGE : The state finds compelling evidence ... that the shooting of William Campbell was an act of self-defense . Yet , I cannot absolve Buck Francisco from all culpability . Two years in a correctional institution , suspended . Buck Francisco is remanded to the custody of his parents ... and placed on probation for three years . Any infraction of the rules of that probation ... and he will immediately serve his full sentence . This hearing is adjourned .

 [ Man ] I 'm afraid our star reporter is going to have to disappear- - Get this joker . ... permanently . Where does all this come from , Bryce ? The components of Carter 's mind . But he 's adding to it . [ Theora ] It 's computer-generated , whatever it is . Looks like Edison . [ Bryce ] People translated as data . - Max . - Damn it ! Two minds but with one single memory . [ helicopter overhead ] [ Edison ] You really like this , don 't you , Martinez ? Nothin ' better , my man . No livin ' thing . [ Edison ] Better than combat , though ? [ Martinez ] Oh , I don 't know . People shoot at you , you tend to concentrate more . [ Edison ] Oh , if only I had a gun ! Well ? It 's no problem . It 's just a Net 23 news chopper . It 's almost out of range . We won . Let 's go ! What the hell ? I 'm getting hot reading . It 's probably a rat . Come on . This place has been swept clean . Ain 't nobody there . It 's worth checking . Ah , come on . It 's probably a rat . Ding-ding . Two minutes to go , uh-huh . [ barking ] What is this ? Poodles on parade during a global ratings sweep ? Well , Frank Braddock has a presentation for us . He 's just after a quick commission . Be on the link in a moment . What now ? Good grief , Ashwell . Braddock is the worst kind of packager there is . We bought better programs from freshman film students . - Sorry , Ben . - [ on screen ] Hi , Benny . Uh , middle of a global ratings sweep , and- - and Network 23 is satelliting dogs . Benny- - Benny , are you ever going to learn ? Hello to you , too , Frank . Of course it 's not necessary for me to remind you that I was hyping globals at the ad market when you were failing potty training . Actually , dogs have traditionally skewed towards higher income-bracket households . Actually , I rather like doggies . - [ Formby ] Ohh ! - You have it your own way . You 're the network , but something tells me that you 're going to need a little bit of sizzle for this global- - I mean , you guys are falling behind . Get on with the pitch , Frank , but fast or forget it . I 'm talking about an activist guerilla war right here in your own city , Benny . Now , this is big , even for global . The whole world loves a bloodbath , Benny . If it 's that so-called terrorist group you 've been hyping for years , forget it . I don 't want any hand-me-downs from Breakthru-TV . - Absolutely . - Don 't be so quick , Benny . The Breakthru option is up , and these guys are very active . They 're very newsworthy right now . I can give you a complete package . I can give you pictures , interviews , news flashes , everything . And low ratings . That 's some bunch of revolutionaries . They don 't do anything . No , thanks . And for God 's sake , stop calling me Benny . But , Ben- - Big mistake , Ben . [ Woman ] Air leasing here ! Buy a 60-second slot on Breakthru Television ! Breakthru slot , guys ! Cyberspace options with 10-second slots . Check our ratings , and check our prices ! [ Man ] Get news with Charlie Griggs at Breakthru ! They got a ratings burst ! Buy time , fella ! [ Man # 2 ] I want 20 seconds of Breakthru , any price ! [ Man # 3 ] Yo ! Grab some Breakthru ! They got a rating burst ! Buy time , fella ! [ Man # 4 ] But everyone 's selling Network 23 , Mr. Barber ! [ Man # 5 ] Sell ! Sell ! [ Man # 6 ] Buy ! [ bell rings ] 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . [ Woman screams ] [ grunt ] Look at Breakthru Television . They 've got a bulletin . Breakthru ? Okay . [ Man on TV ] The affected area is in the foothills north of Sector 7- [ Murray ] That 's fast . - ... the industrial strip once used for heavy manufacturing . Cause of the explosion is not known . Ah-Ah-Ah , good old Breakthru T-T-T-TV . I wouldn 't touch it with a bent TV aerial . Hmm . Well , they beat us to this story . It must have just happened . Where 's Edison ? Edison , this is Control . There 's been an explosion in Sector 7 . Take a look at this . [ Reporter ] A caller to Breakthru-TV News moments ago identified himself as a soldier in the White Brigade . He claimed full responsibility . [ Edison ] How did Breakthru get there so fast ? [ Reporter ] And that the same caller provided footage of the actual explosion . [ Edison ] Somebody give me a break . Got it , Theora . We 're right over it . We 're going in . Almost on the ground , Theora . No sign of Breakthru yet . Stand by to record , Control . Edison Carter at Network 23 . What 's going on here ? Some guerrilla group is claiming responsibility . Any casualties ? They told us not to look for any . Nobody was here . You seem very certain . Gwynn , get this man out of here . It 's Edison Carter , Chief . I don 't care if it 's the Angel Gabriel . Get him out of here . Come on . You know me . I 've got a right to be here . The only right you got is to cover that chopper seat with your butt . Now move . Chief , here 's Breakthru ! They get in , right ? Opposition 's here , Control . Breakthru-TV just flew in by road . Cover your ears . This may be indelicate . I just got thrown off that explosion story . What the hell are you grinning at ? All right , all right . - It happens . - Not to me . All right . Come on . You were here . You talk to me . You tell me what happened . [ Murray ] I understand it was a White Brigade action . You understand it was a White Brigade action . - So what ? - It 's a deal . Breakthru-TV has the rights to package White Brigade action . They have the exclusive . Oh , come on , Murray . Look , we 're in the middle of a 24-hour global ratings sweep . We are all looking for the edge . Hey , come on . So we got outbid for a story package . It 's all part of the game . Since when has news been entertainment ? Since it was invented ? [ Reporter ] This Is Breakthru-TV with an exclusive news story . Moments ago , a huge explosion rocked this area . Only luck prevented huge casualties . Yeah , and the fact there was no one within miles of it . - ... has been uninhabited- - - Creep . No , no . I think Breakthru-TV gives bad-bad-bad broadcasting a good name . Responsibility is claimed by the White Brigade , an activist group dedicated to " neo-radicalistic anarcho-syndicalism . " Cheapskates can 't afford our hi-tech sat-cams , you see ? But they can afford to buy us off a story , right ? Right ? [ Reporter ] Only luck saved- - - Right ? - Oh , right , right . You 're always right , sir . Right . Well , I guess I might as well take the day off , then , eh ? Yes , please . Murray ? Right . Breakthru-TV 's on the spot at the time . Stay tuned to Breakthru . We 'll bring you the news as it happens in this exciting story . [ Man ] You get on Breakthru and get some air time fast . Buy any second you can . Who 's selling ? Good work , guys . It 's a work of art . [ Man on phone ] You liked the pictures , Frank ? They 're great . You just keep them coming , okay ? Boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , right ? Right , Frank . What you 're seeing is a ratings bonanza for Breakthru right in the middle of global sweeps . Very clever . I 'll take that call from Ped Xing now . Put him up on the big screen . Yes , sir . Good morning , sir . Breakthru-TV has offered us full sponsorship in its coverage of the White Brigade activities . Very nice explosions . Frank Braddock . Breakthru-TV simply hasn 't the resources or the ratings to be competitive for long , Mr. Xing . It doesn 't need too many resources to be competitive with dogs , Mr. Cheviot . Zik-Zak is watching with great concern . You must not lose your edge , or you lose Zik-Zak . [ singing off ] Perhaps we should have taken up Braddock 's offer for the package . This White Brigade seems to become active at just the right time . [ sigh ] Move out . Area 's clear . Let 's go home . Well , well , well . Looks like it wasn 't a rat after all . [ Murray ] It 's the old story . Oof ! Money talks , you know ? Money shouts ! But 23 has got more of it than Breakthru-TV . So why didn 't Cheviot buy that White Brigade package ? I don 't know . [ gasping ] Nice shot . Maybe there is something wrong with it . Did-Did-Did the hole in your racquet come with the shorts-s-s ? People in glass houses should not throw stones . Now that- - Now that sounds like a game . What would be wrong with a good package ? Uh- - - Nice shot . - Oh , thanks . Keep our eyes on the ba-ba-ball . Thank you , Coach . Pfft . So ... who puts the deal together ? Packager ! Yeah , but how does he get it ? I suppose he does a deal with ... the terrorists . Well , now , how do you do a regular package story deal with terrorists ? That 's it . That 's the best thing that could have happened to that game . Now , how did they get the cameras on the spot ? And not after , but during the explosion . Who shot that material ? And who wants to buy it before it happened ? Right , so whoever 's doing the deal must know before the event takes place . Exactly . It raises a big question , doesn 't it ? Mmm , nice legs . Oh , thanks . Maybe I can get a closer look at yours some time . I 'd just like to see my-my-m-mine . [ Edison chuckles ] - Give me Cheviot . - Okay . Well , I know exactly who that packager is , Murray . Poor guy could be in a lot of trouble . Poor guy ? He 's a madman . He 's encouraging dangerous acts . Maybe even commissioning them . I say we go for total exposure . Sound moral positions , will you ? Exactly . And the real payoff will be the ratings , right when we need them . Perfect . Murray , get Carter on the story . Let 's give this top priority- - a major expos√© . And , uh , Murray , put some pants on . [ laughter ] All right , it 's on . Where do you want to start ? At the explosion . Theora , check the location . Okay . It 's clear . They 've all gone home . Okay , get Martinez to wind her up . I 'm going to go get changed . Do you- - Do you know who won ? It was a draw . So who won the dr-dr-dr-draw ? [ Martinez ] This guy 's packaging terrorism for television ? [ Edison ] He videos their action , then sells it to a network at the ad market . So what did they blow up anyway ? Looks like it was already blown up . [ Edison ] No kidding . [ Martinez ] I wonder who wrote this explosion . [ Edison ] The only thing that survived was a good script . Huh . Hey . Maybe they 're testing a new rat trap . Man , I guess they got one . [ chuckles ] What the hell is this ? Camera gun clip . - Hey , that 's one of ours . - I know it . But why here ? Sorry to bother you , Bennie . Didn 't we call this fringe time once upon a time ? The- - The dead hour just before prime time ? Before we had 10,000 channels ? Yes , I remember . I see you 've added nostalgia to your repertoire . That 's very touching . Now , precisely what do you want ? I want your patience , Benny , and I think that you 're going to want mine . Switch to Breakthru Network , if you 'll indulge me . Mr. Croyd Hauser . It has become common practice for anyone at war with the system to claim responsibility for any attack on the system . The White Brigade rejects this method . Our next strike takes place now ! [ Reporter ] You saw that live . Croyd Hauser , the leader of the White Brigade , announcing a new pre-emptive strike as it happened , and providing live commentary . At this time , we have no further information . Metro forces are converging on the scene . We 'll keep you posted as to the situation . Look at that , Benny . Look at the ratings ! Convenient timing . I 'm just- - just a lucky kind of guy , I guess , but listen , even you have to admit that th-this package sells . Oh , it sells , Frank , but Edison Carter sells better , and right now he 's doing a very hot story about the packaging of terrorism . So I don 't believe Network 23 is quite ready to pick up your White Brigade option . You 've stepped way out of line . Goodbye , Frank . Nice try . Uhhn ! Uh ... [ squawk ] Faster , faster . [ squawk ] Uh ... [ whistles ] Uh , Bryce , I need to find out what 's on this . A footprint . Bryce , this is serious , and I 'm in a hurry . More haste , less speed , Edison . Here . What a mess . This may take some time- - something of which I 'm in extremely short supply . Just do it . [ Man ] Sorry you got hurt . I knew your infrared was too big for a rat . I can 't guarantee much , but we 'll see something . The tape was too damaged to run , so I 'm doing a laser scan . It 's all so time-consuming . That 's the explosion site . Run that again . Freeze it . - Martinez ? - Hmm ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's the one we saw , all right . Why would anyone want to take pictures of that ? It is rather puzzling . See , the explosion happened when the van was here . See , this is a real time cut . See ? There 's the time codes . So if the van was there at the time of the explosion , then why wasn 't it in the news report ? - [ Edison ] Exactly . - Ahh . Be-Be-Be-Be-Because it was reporting the news- - the news . He 's right . There 's a camera on top . [ Max ] Oh . Oh . It 's certainly not an exhaust pipe . Oh , the rig-rig-rigors of investigation . So tiring . Bryce , hit internal line 16 . I want you to see this . All right , tell me again , Phil . Well , uh , she came in late last night , and , uh , she was very sweet to me . She , uh , brought me a bottle of wine , and , well , like I said- - Would you spare the details ? There 's a female present . Then what ? Well , she , uh , asked if she could borrow it . I mean , what could I say ? So I , uh ... let it go to her . Borrow what ? The RR-7 . - Camera gun . - Who ? Janie Crane . Our eager new staff reporter . I don 't want her to see me . Won 't she say anything ? Oh , she says plenty , Mr. Hauser , but not who she is . Did she see the van at the explosion ? See it ? [ snickering ] She 's been riding in it . Oh , but there 's no clip on her camera gun . Look . Who uses these ? I don 't know . Why did I ask ? Janie 's good , Edison . She 'll be all right . So where is she ? There 's a residual infrared exhaust trace . I 'm linking it to you now . Got it , Control . Okay , Martinez , let 's go . Little fool must have been out here during the explosion . Why do women do crazy things like that ? Probably because she was onto this long before we were . I bet she 's tracking the same vehicle as you . [ Edison ] Let 's hope she hasn 't found a tragic ending . Heat trail ends here , Control . Going down . [ Theora ] I have you located by satellite . No indications of company near you . Thanks , Control . Martinez is just trying to find a dangerous place to land . Still no activity . You 're going to be here when I get back , right ? Yeah . Stay linked to me through Theora . - I might need you . - I 'll be there . Take care , buddy . Hey , don 't get yourself shot at . I 'll do my best . Control ? Catch me if you can . Now we 're in a mess , Croyd . [ Croyd laughs ] Why so ? We had the bangs and the pictures . 23 won 't play ball . Carter 's out on the story chasing us . And some girl saw the setup . We 've got the girl . And Carter doesn 't have a clue where we are . Relax . If they blow this story , we 're in trouble . I 'm in trouble . With the ratings Breakthru is getting , they 'll want to keep the option . Forget 23 . Croyd , I know that , but if this story gets out on 23 , they 're going to have one hell of a story , and Breakthru-TV will drop us like a radioactive fuel line . And I will be finished in the marketplace . Well , there 's no gain without pain . And we 've had a good run . But I 've got you a very big finale . Maybe a few real injuries ... but it could make us a pile of money before the end . Sell it fast , Frank . Don 't have the stomach for the real thing , Frank ? You 're a dreamer , Croyd . You always were , filled with this half-baked , clich√©-ridden world of semi-revolution , and suddenly you actually suggest killing people . You 're nuts . Now , I 'm a businessman . I am not a folk hero . Our deals were no casualties . Get the girl into the van , Hewett . Yes , sir . Maybe we 'll have to sacrifice her for a half-baked- - [ chuckle ] - - clich√©-ridden world of semi-revolution . Uh-huh . Control , I 'm on foot . [ Theora ] I 'm with you . A black van just passed me . Tail it . Okay . I 've got it . Stay linked to me and the chopper . I might need out fast . I 'm following , Edison . I 'll have to go in further . They 're well hidden . You 're getting too far from the chopper . To tell you the truth , I don 't think I could find my way out even if I was close . You 're too exposed , Edison . You 're going to have to help me out , Control . Edison , I can 't authorize this . You better get somebody who can . I 'm going in , Control . If these guys are trigger-happy , my best chance is to let them know whatever they do is being recorded . Keep talking to me . Edison , you need backup . You can 't do it alone . No time . No choice . Janie could still be in there . - Stay with me . - Edison . Theora , you still there ? As ever . - [ Croyd ] Get rid of this . - [ Hewitt ] Yes , sir . I want it totally destroyed . I want the front part totally- - Okay , I see them . I 'm going in shooting . Hold it ! Don 't shoot ! This camera is linked live ! I 'm recording it- - [ chatter ] [ Edison ] It 's a studio . Mr. Carter . How very dramatic . Yeah , it 's a stage I 'm going through . Ha ha ha ha ! You , uh , seem surprised . What were you expecting ? A terrorist headquarters . Well , as you see , not a lot of terror . You certainly have an unusual command post . Very disarming . Disarmed . It 's more comfortable than being in the field . The hours are just as bad , though . Maybe worse . And the scripts need changing all the time . Can we talk ? Might as well . It 's either that or kill you . Gotcha . [ laughs ] Come on . I 'll show you around . I 'll show you some of our latest footage . Very state of the art . State of the art of warfare . I 've gotten to be a bit of a special effects expert by now . [ laughing ] Why are you here ? What happened to your war ? A long time ago , it became obvious that military action was obsolete . People could die , of course , and passions would be inflamed , but only until the next TV program came on . It finally struck me that I didn 't need to wage a real war . I could wage one ... through ... through TV . Much more profitable . What about the attacks around the city ? Fake . I mean , there 's a small chance that someone might get hurt , but we 've been very careful to clear the area first . What does the White Brigade get out of all this ? Money . We 're the first terrorists to apply modern merchandising theory . I work with a packager . He sells the product . I take 80 % . It 's been a good arrangement . Been ? Never assume that I work for anyone , Mr. Carter , much less a TV news show packager . I have my own agenda . I still have a real revolution . But not here . Brilliant . Just brilliant . Breakthru-TV 's going to be flayed alive for this . Hauser just let you walk out ? Sure . It 's just another story . This time we pay him for it instead of Breakthru . He has other plans- - quite a racket . Uh , shouldn 't you get changed ? I 'm going to pre-empt and drop this in the last quarter of today 's show . Ted , I 'm going to reschedule- - So Janie wasn 't there . No . Hauser had seen nothing of her . Martinez thinks she dropped the camera gun during the explosion and took off . Probably to hide from Murray . I 'm afraid she 's in for a nasty lecture from both of us . Buy integrity air leasing , Charles ! [ Man ] I 've got 10 seconds on Edison Carter ! [ Announcer on TV ] Network 23 interrupts its regular programming for this special report from Edison Carter . For the past few days , this city has lived in fear- - not the normal worries about getting through the day when the TV won 't work or the computer crashes , but primal fear . - Someone is trying to kill us . - I 'll find Braddock . Hello . How are you ? Good to see you again . We 're all seen the stories on a competing network about strikes by the White Brigade . Network 23 has learned that the strikes are staged- - He 's probably licking his wounds . Well , I hope they choke him . I can 't abide that the whole thing was a fake . Hi . How are you ? Hustle is one thing , but this complete fabrication- - [ Man ] Hi , Ben . Uh , excuse me a minute , Julia . I have to see the President of Network 5 about that Fellini package . - Hello , Jack . - Hi . [ no audible dialogue ] [ no audible dialogue ] [ screaming ] Aah ! Get a doctor ! What the hell 's going on here ? [ Woman ] Get the emergency facilities ! [ doorbell buzzes ] Go away . I 'm not home . [ buzz ] Edison . [ door bleeps , buzzes ] Hi . Men in the morning . Edison , sorry to wake you like this , but you need to know what happened . And who locked their view-phone off ? - Edison . - Yaah . - [ Woman on TV ] There have been injuries- - - Uh ... - This live- - - You 're not going to like this . ... Network 23 , courtesy of Breakthru-TV . [ Male announcer ] Contrary to reports earlier on Network 23 , the attacks by the White Brigade have proven to be horribly real . There is no official word on casualties , but again , there have been injuries . - This live ... - What is this , Theora ? from Network 23 courtesy of Breakthru-TV . You heard Hauser . The whole story was fake . I know , I know , but something happened to change it . How 's Murray taking it ? I don 't know , but Cheviot and Formby were at the ad market when it happened . Are they all right ? Cheviot 's fine . Formby was injured . Not badly , we think . Murray 's going to take it in the neck for this one . And interrupting your breakfast-fast-fast- - breakfast , for those cold mornings , why not try Chernobyl Pops-Pops-Pops ? Give you that warm glow all over . Just-Just-Just the stuff to feed your kids . What is he talking about ? Right in the middle of a global ratings sweep . Can you imagine worse timing , Murray ? No , sir . It was spectacularly bad timing . How reliable is Edison Carter , really ? Carter is the most reliable reporter in the business . I 'm sure he feels just as badly about this as we do . Absolutely . It 's not his fault , sir . His report was impeccable . Hauser seemed perfectly genuine . Get me Frank Braddock . This is not going to be easy . Thank you , Murray . I 'll talk to you privately later . [ phone rings ] I want to thank you , Frank , for interceding with Breakthru-TV and getting us the use of their feed this afternoon . It took a little salesmanship , Ben , considering that Carter , uh , broadcast , but look , it 's the least I could do . I 'm- - I 'm- - I 'm glad you 're okay . God , that could have been nasty . Yes , it , uh , was rather close . Look , Breakthru-TV 's begging me to stay , and it 's tough to turn down , you know , but I still prefer Network 23 . I mean ... after all we 've been through together . [ Formby ] You have no choice , Ben . A strong global is worth any sacrifice , even Frank Braddock . Ben , Formby 's right . We 're broadcasters . In our business , morals are one thing , but ratings are everything . You don 't buy the package , somebody else will . I 'm talking about ratings , Benny , big numbers . Now how about it . This network cannot be a party to killing , even accidentally . It would have to be clean . I wouldn 't want so much as a single injury , is that clear ? Benny , Benny , if I have to French kiss Croyd Hauser in the middle of the Doggie Dance Show , it 'll be clean . Trust me . Do we have a deal ? [ Ashwell ] I say we deal , Ben . [ Edwards ] Ratings , Ben . Okay , Frank . We 'll buy it . You 'll have a contract before the day is out . Right . Now , I want massive news flash promos , a big upcoming story on the White Brigade action . I want the biggest cover we can get on this . I want those ratings . So how was it ? Not terrific . You know , I 'd like to get a hold of that Hauser personally . He took us . That 's what gets me . He suckered us . Me , Murray . I believed every word he said . - There 's something else . - What ? Maybe he lied about Janie , too . Maybe she was there . All right . I 'll get Martinez over to you . You get back out there , and you find that bastard . See the ad market attack ? Yeah , I saw it . It damaged that place real bad . Rare enough to be a big story . Well , it sure as hell getting to be a dangerous one . Janie 's missing for real . - [ laughing ] - Whee ! Oh , you really love this , don 't you ? Sure , I got the deal . You got to trust me . What , have you ever known me to fail ? Listen , I want to tell you something . I 'm very sorry about the things that I said . I was emotional . You 're a great guy . You are a great guy . And this one you got going now , I think it 's really great . I love it . But let 's make sure that there are no , uh , no rats in it this time , right ? - [ laughing ] - I 'll meet you there . I love to watch a professional in action . Control , we 're back at Hauser 's telly terrorist headquarters , going in now . We 're just trimming our rotor tips . Martinez , I don 't think we 'll fit in there . Knowing Hauser , he 's probably expecting us , so ... watch your step . You got it . We 're on the ground , Control . For some reason , still in one piece . Stay close . This time , they won 't be so friendly . This place is empty . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , Theora , the horse has bolted . Over to you . [ Theora ] I 'm on it . Get airborne . Gun it , Martinez . Let 's go ! Got something . Right . West 280 degrees . There 's a single vehicle , and it 's going like hell . Get hold of Murray . Tell him we 're after his favorite terrorist . He 's right here . What about Janie ? I wish I knew , Murray . Okay , Martinez , pretend we 're being shot at . [ Martinez ] I 'm concentrating now . We 're ready , Croyd . We just need to plant the stuff . The little lady can do that . She 'll die for a great cause . You are crazy . Once I- - Once I tell the world about this , you 'll be finished . [ Hewett , laughing ] When this thing goes bang , you 'll make reporting history , all right- - the first Network 23 girl reporter in orbit . [ Edison ] How far ahead , Theora ? Uh , you 're about 10 minutes , maybe 10 1 / 2 . Okay , just so long as we don 't lose him . If he 's in that vehicle , I want to be there when he steps out . [ Martinez ] That depends on where he stops . He just has . The vehicle stopped . That makes it seven minutes . Look , this is just a thought , but what if they 're armed in there ? Martinez will love it . I 've planted the charge over there , just to the right of that thing . Look , are you sure about this ? Just get the camera , Lucien . E equals MC squared Push it to the edge , Martinez . How long , Theora ? Five minutes , your speed . Where ? There . - Here ? - Yes . Your sacrifice will be a tragic waste . [ Theora ] There 's a lot of activity now . Edison , they could be setting another charge . I hope it 's not what I think it is . Just wire it up , Bosko . Just give me the cord . Just go back to your van . Just don 't- - Line up a good shot . Looks good . Nice shot . Lucien , you getting the picture ? Edison , there 's another vehicle . It 's approaching the van . Martinez , when you were in the war , what odds did you like ? Oh , about 10-1 ... against . I think that 's about what we 've got now . Okay , let 's do it . Come on in , Braddock . We 're about to blow it . Oh , this monitor here . - Yeah . - I see . That 's great . Did you know your camera 's a little crooked ? Naturally . The girl dropped it while running . It keeps recording as she runs on , then boom ! Steps on the mine , bits everywhere . Where 'd you get the dummy ? We didn 't . That 's the girl from 23 that was snooping around . What , you mean she 's real ? Hauser , have you gone insane ? That 's murder ! It 's revolution , Braddock . You wanted the big one , well , you got it . And 23 is transmitting it . Lucien , feed that direct link to 23 ! We 'll go live on this ! Croyden , we 're too close . We 've got to move away . Hauser , there 's a chopper ! The cavalry ! No . It 's the 23 chopper . They 're on to us ! Then we 'll have to give them something that 'll- - that 'll make news . - Yeah ! - Yeah ! Hauser , no , not the button . We 're too close to the charge . Charge . Charge ! Then we 'll all blow up with it ! [ all shouting ] There 's a body on the steps . Get down to it . It 's Janie Crane . Good God , get down there , Martinez ! Fast ! Let 's go ! [ all shouting ] Ahh- - Mr. Cheviot , I 'm routing pictures to you . This is an emergency . [ Ben ] Good Lord . Look ! [ Edison ] Hold it now . I can grab her . Janie , come on ! Hold tight ! [ shouting ] Take it up ! Hang on , Janie ! We 've got you ! [ shouting ] Braddock . I 'll kill him with my own hands . Ben , let me . Look at those ratings ! Unbelievable . [ Murray ] We are live . Stand by , everybody . [ Edison ] I hand you over now to the reporter who broke this story and nearly paid for it with her life . The girl who , 24 hours ago , broke the rules , backed a hunch , and brought you this story . Janie Crane , Network 23 , reporting to you live- - just- - and direct from the scene . Zoom in , Martinez . This story started many months ago ... but my part it in began and almost ended just this morning . I became trapped between the destruction by this terrorist ... And now- - And now we come to a special moment on Network 23- - that is The Most Point-Point-P-Pointless and Extravagant Television Award . This , of course , is the award for the piece-piece of television which-which-which , in the opinion of the judges , is the most expensive and wasteful use of television time this year . So- - So- - let 's see the nominations , shall we ? And I 'll be right back . [ grunt ] Hi . This is M-Max Headroom on Network 23 , brought-brought-brought to you by ... uh ... no , no , no , no , no , no-no-no . I 'm sorry- - I 'm sorry , but if they think I 'm endorsing car accessories , they 've got another dipstick-stick coming . Ah-Ah , they 've tried this one before , and I 'm radial tired of it . If they expect me to change gear now and start spark-spark - sparkplugging their products , they must be out of their pis-pis-pistonheads . Listen , I don 't like to blow my own gasket , but I have better things to do than to sit here and wax-polish lyrical about car parts- - car parts . I 've got letters from fan-belts who say " Max , you 're special . " You 're unique . You 're differential . " Yes , yes , I know it 's what they want . That 's because they 're air-conditioned to it- - to it- - to it . Oh , I 've fendered it off time and timing belt again . I mean , who 's calling the tu-tu-tune-up ? Who 's in cru-cru-c-cruise control here anyway ? I 'll tell you who . Me . Me . Max Headlamp . And if they don 't like it , they can stick-stick - stickshift it in their exhaust pipe and cho-choke it . And smoke it .

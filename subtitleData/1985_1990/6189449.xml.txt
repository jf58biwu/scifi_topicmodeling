 - You have imagination ! - Yes , what do I get for it , then ? - You can get a kiss ! - Oh , girls ... You can 't lie down to sleep here . We don 't want a fuss now . Rise and Shine . You can 't lie here , this is a public place . Quiet ! Quiet ... Gone ! Gone ... It disappeared ! Do you have a clue about what you are asking for ? Here I 'd found a great place for contact with ... with other worlds ! - Just now I got a call and ... - No , now you take it easy . - We have to follow the regulations . - Blah blah blah . You can certainly contact your voices from space again ... - What a funny radio . - Radio ! Oh , oh , oh ... Oh , oh , oh ! I 've had that feeling ! And now it 's time ! Far out in space lies the planet Gyllenblå . The people there live their daily lives in joy and love ... but sometimes also in concern and controversy . When the war 's casualties hit them emerges readily a strong man that recruits followers by convincing them and himself that he and no other answers for reason . He often speaks with a loud voice to drown out any opposition . Reason must take over ! Join with me - Ratio Rasch I promise you that there will be peace and good order ! There are those who scoff at me but soon they 'll have finished laughing . Long live the ice-cold reason ! This is the home of reason , it 's called Gyllenblå The clear sapphire , of noble gold is the foundation upon which we stand , - Whoever the bottle points to will ... - Will what ? Hurry up ! Will kiss Frederick ! It 's Eva ! What are you doing inside at recess ? Cherry ! - What 's the matter ? - Cherries ! - I want to give them to the children . - Why ? Are you not really wise ? Why do we give children cherries ? I understand enough ... Go away and leave the kids alone . You are grumpy , I think . Take a cherry ! No , thanks ! And now off with you ! Be quiet ! - What 's your name that you like to laugh ? - Frederick . I can 't see that there 's very much to laugh about ... Go now ! - Hello ! - Hello ! - Is that your child ? - Yes , it appears so . - They laugh when you tell them off ! - They don 't mean offense . - Laughter is healthy . - Healthy ? ! - It 's nice to laugh at school . - At us teachers or to each other ? Both for us and for each other ! Laughter is man 's greatest gift ! We are here to teach them a little sense ! Has man received a gift , it 's reason . It 's not to laugh ! Imagine if you had Jörgensen as class teacher . - I would move . That 's for sure . - Me too ! A long way ... You should get a kiss , Fredrik ! Eva ... It doesn 't look as if it wants to ... Maybe it 's too hot today . Actually , I had thought that we would talk about serious things . About how it looks on the earth . As you know , there are many areas of war and fear . But I have no heart for it when it 's still summer ! We 'll take time off ! - Where 's my bike ? I put it here . - Was it locked , then ? - Yes , it was right here . - Fredrik rode it before the bell rang . - Did you ? - No . - You must have done ! - Cecilie ! There are fresh tracks here ! Check it out ! - Isn 't it yours ? - Yes ! - Aren 't these your strips ? - Yes , they are ! He must have gone down to the lake ! Come on ! - Check it out ! Another one ! - Come ! - If we don 't find it , I 'll take yours ! - Ha , ha , ha . - There 's a crossbar on my bike . - Oh , that means nothing . - I 'll sit on the crossbar instead . - Crossbar ? How clumsy you are ! I 'm glad it 's not me who 'll kiss you . Oh , a cherry ! - Pips ! Look ! They 're wet also . - Look , another cherry ! It must be the guy with the cherries ! Come on , then ! Come on ! We are there ! As I thought ... It 's quiet ! Look ! Cherries ! With my instrument I can no longer hear the laughter in outer space . Reason ... and intelligence , it 's probably fine . Wisdom and genius , it 's useful and necessary ... But wisdom is nothing compared with laughter because laughter is eternal ! It is eternal , because it 's divine ! If laughter was silenced anywhere , wherever it is , it 's a tragedy . It ... it must be prevented , otherwise ... Otherwise , it 's our turn next time ! Pull yourself together now ! The imagination can bridge distances that are infinite ... What man can conceive , he can also manipulate ! We are living in a difficult time , but we have to live by our feelings too . Not just by our cold reason . We have to play , fantasize , laugh . Do you hear that , kids ? However they are trying to deceive you ... - Laughter is vital ! - It 's not whatRatio Rasch says ! - I know , but I believe what I believe . - Do you believe in God also ? Yes , maybe ... I don 't think that man represents the highest wisdom . Anyone who thinks it , I distrust . Love is more important than all the world 's collective wisdom . - Many claim the opposite , but ... - Epicycle ! - Photon , I have a lesson . - I know , but look at the remote screen . No , sit down down ! The lesson isn 't over . Remember that laughter will carry us through all difficulties for those who can laugh can never really be defeated . Think about it , when reason wants to lead you astray . Stop ! Think of your job ! - Supernova ! - I had a feeling ... - No , let me go ! - Take her away ! - Do you also deny reason ? - Deny ? No ... No , absolutely not ! Reason is of course something very good . Though we ... we have to have ... something else too ... maybe a little ... No , I said certain something foolish ! Silence ! You shouldn 't laugh . Hurrah for reason ! - Long live it ! - Hooray ! Hooray ! Hooray ! I 'm taking over your education . Back straight ! Long live Gyllenblå ! With effect from today I , Ratio Rasch , have taken power ! I proclaim myself President over Gyllenblå ! Thus ends all battles poisoning our planet ! We have to change ourselves ! Under this sign we will rally round in seriousness and unity ! I am a gentle man . Only those who laugh at me I will crush ! - Do it now , then ! - No , I don 't want to ! Look , a bike ! - It 's yours , Cecilie . - Is there anything wrong with it ? - In that case , you repair it , Frederick . - Me ? ! - Cherries ! It 's him who lives in the house . - It 's him who 's the thief ! Quiet ! He can hear us ... Come on ! Come on ! - We 'll report him to the police . - There 's no point . He 'll only deny it . - We 'll steal some cherries in revenge . - No , don 't do it . - He might be dangerous . - Bullshit ! Come on , little children . Come and taste the doctor Krulls special giant cherry . Come on ! - Eva , jump in and kiss him now ! - No ! - You don 't dare ! - Yes ! Come , little children . I need two , I think . A boy ... and a girl . Come on ! Subtitles by Squashy Hat ( 2015 )

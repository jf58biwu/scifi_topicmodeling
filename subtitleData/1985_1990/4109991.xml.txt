Come on ! Give me your hand ! Get the door closed ! Benthic Explorer , Salvor 1 on final . Over . Copy you , Salvor 1 . This is Benthic Explorer . You 're cleared to land . Hey ! They 're coming . This ... could get pretty ugly . Yeah . Does not look good at all . Oh , no . Look who 's with them . The queen bitch of the universe . Sonny , how you doin ' ? I 've got 2 more welds on this bypass valve . No light from the surface . - How deep are they ? - McBride ? 1,700 feet . - I need them to go below 2,000 . - No problem . They can do that . So that 's it ? You just cheerfully turn the whole thing over to the goon squad ? Look , I was told to cooperate . I 'm cooperating . Kirkhill , you 're pathetic . Get Brigman on the line . Deepcore , this is Benthic . Man , if Bud goes along with this they 're gonna have to shoot her with a tranquilizer gun . - Roger . - Hippy , get me Bud . Catfish , get them old bones up here and give me a hand . Hang on . I 'll be up there in a second . Hey , you guys are milking ' that job . Yeah , it 's just because we love freezing our butts off out here for you so much . - Bring me another hammer ! - Hey , Bud ! - Yeah ! ? Hippy 's on the bitch box ! It 's a call from topside . That new company man . - Kirkhill ? - Yeah . That guy don 't know his butt from a rat hole . Perry , do me a favor , square away this mud hose and get rid of some of these empty sacks . - This place is starting to look like my apartment . - You got it , boss ! - Bud , pick up the topside line . Urgent . - I 'm coming , I 'm coming ! Jeez , keep your pantyhose on ! Brigman here . Yeah , Kirkhill . What 's goin ' on ? Yeah , I 'm calm . I 'm a calm person . Is there some reason why I shouldn 't be calm ? WHAT ! ? All right , I 'm on last feed now . Hey can you get that goddamn hippy shit music off the comm line , please ? I 'm almost done with the shut-off valve . Sonny , I 'm right behind you with the next fitting . Hang on a second . - OK , give it to me . - Here you go . Thanks , sweetie . All divers , drop what you 're doin ' . Everybody out of the pool . I mean everybody right now . Sonny , One Night , let 's go . Damn it . We just got out here . There was a time when I woulda asked why . - Get a move on ! - Shit , woman ! Deepcore , Deepcore . This is Flatbed preparing to surface . Roger , Flatbed . Come on up . All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool . Everybody get to sub bay . ASAP . Come on . Let 's get his hat off . - Take it off . - What the hell 's goin ' on ? - How come we got recalled ? - The hell if I know . I got it . - What 's the drift , partner ? Why are we up ? - Just follow standard procedure . Flog your dog till somebody tells you what 's happenin ' . - What 's the story , boss ? - Folks , listen up ! We just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig . - Oh , shit ! - What ? We 've received an invitation to , um , cooperate in a matter of national security . Now you know as much as I do . Get your gear off and get to control . We 've got a briefing in 10 minutes . Come on , come on ! Let 's move it ! At 09 : 22 local time today , an American nuclear submarine the USS Montana , with 156 men aboard , went down ... - ... about 22 miles from here . - Damn ! There 's been no contact with the sub since then . The cause of the incident is not known . Your company has authorized the navy 's use of this facility for a rescue operation code-named Operation Salvor . - You want us to search for the sub ? - No . We know where it is . But she 's in 2,000 feet of water and we can 't reach her . We need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors , if any . Don 't you have your own stuff for this kind of thing ? By the time we get our submersibles here , the storm will be on us . You can get your rig in and be on site in 15 hours . That makes you our best option . Why should we risk our butts for something like this ? I have been authorized to offer you all special bonuses equivalent to 3 times normal dive pay . Yes , sir , buddy ! For triple time , I 'd eat Beany ! Set me on fire and put me out with horse piss . Look I don 't know what kind of deal you made with the company ... - ... but my people are not qualified for this . We 're oil workers . - This is a paycheck ! Shut up ! Hold it down . This is Lieutenant Coffey . He will transfer down to you with a SEAL team and supervise the operation . You can send down whoever you like , but I 'm the tool pusher on this rig . When it comes to the safety of these people , there 's me and then God . Understand ? If things get dicey , I 'm pulling the plug . I think we 're all on the same wavelength , Brigman . Now , let 's get the wellhead uncoupled , shall we ? All right let 's get ready to meet . Let 's take it about 5 degrees left , all right ? Roger . 5 degrees left , Bud . Plot these numbers to our position . I need to know when the leading edge will hit . Well , it 's official sports fans . They 're calling it Hurricane Frederick . And it 's gonna be making our lives ... - ... real interesting in a few hours . - Fred huh ? I don 't know , man . I think hurricanes should be named after women , don 't you ? - I can 't believe you 're letting them do this . - Hi , Lins ! I thought you were in Houston . I was . Now I 'm here . - Only here isn 't where I left it , is it , Bud ? - Wasn 't up to me . We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work . - I can 't believe you let them grab my rig ! - Your rig ? - My rig . I designed the damn thing . - Benthic Petroleum paid for it . So as long as they 're holding the pink slip , I go where they tell me . I had a lot riding on this . They bought you , didn 't they ? More like rented you cheap ! I 'm switchin ' off now . Bye-bye . Oh , OK . Virgil , you wiener ! You never could stand up to a fight ! Bye-bye . Virgil ? God , I hate that bitch ! Probably shouldn 't have married her , then , huh ? Get it stable ! Roger Cab 3 . You 're clear to launch . Hang on , gentlemen . Touchdown ! Crowd goes wild ! Explorer , this is Cab 3 . We are styling . - How you boys doin ' back there ? - Great . Explorer , this is Cab 3 . Starting our descent along the umbilical . - Roger that , Cab 3 . Good luck . - Luck is not a factor . I got a white line fever , baby . Yeah , I heard that . Deepcore , Deepcore . - This is Cab 3 on final approach . - Roger , Cab 3 . Is that you , Lindsey ? None other . Oh , no ! Howdy , boys ! Hey , Lindsey ! I 'll be damned ! Y 'all shouldn 't be down here , sweet thing . You might ruin your stockings . The bad news is we got 8 hours in this can blowing ' down . And the worst news is it 's gonna take us 3 weeks ... - ... to decompress later . - We 've all been fully briefed , Mrs. Brigman . Just don 't call me that , OK ? I hate that . All right . What would you like us to call you ? Sir ? There we go ! Y 'all start equalizin ' ... now ! Let 's watch each other closely for signs of HPNS . High Pressure Nervous Syndrome . Muscle tremors , usually in the hands first . - Nausea , increased excitability ... - Disorientation . And a partridge in a pear tree . About 1 person in 20 can 't handle it . They just go buggo . Look , they 've all made runs to this depth . - They checked out . - I understand that . What I 'm saying is it 's impossible to predict ... - ... just who 's susceptible . - They checked out . - These guys the SEALs ? - Yeah . Those guys ain 't so tough . I 've fought guys plenty tougher than them . Now we get to hear how you could have been a contender ? Hey ! Hey ! - You see this ? - Yeah . They used to call this the hammer . Y 'all done to a turn and ready to serve . Everybody OK ? - They 're really very sweet . - Yeah . Hey ! I don 't remember putting a wall here . How you doin ' , Jammer ? - Pretty good . How are you , little lady ? - I 'm OK . - I want a full check on their gear . - Yes sir . - These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit . - Got that right . Hippy , you 're gonna give that rat a disease . Hi , Lins ! Well , well . Mrs. Brigman . Not for long . You never did like being called that , did you ? Not even when it meant something . - Is that One Night in Flatbed ? - Yeah . Who else ? Here . Say hi . - Hey , One Night . It 's Lindsey . - Oh , hi , Lindsey . OK Bud obstacle avoidance is showin ' a rise out about 100 meters . What do you wanna do ? - Copy Bud . - You know I can 't believe you were dumb enough to come down here . Now you 're stuck here for the storm . - That was dumb , hot rod . Real dumb . - I didn 't come down here to fight with you . So what are you doin ' down here hot rod ? You need me . Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do . Once you 're disconnected from The Explorer , you guys are on your own for however long this storm lasts . I mean what if something was to happen after the surface support clears off ? What would you have done ? Wow , you 're right . Us poor dumb old boys might 've had to think for ourselves . It could 've been a disaster . - You wanna know what I think ? - Jesus ! Look where this thing is set . - You wanna know what I think ? - Not particularly . - I think you were worried about me . - Then that must be it . No , seriously . I think you were . Come on . It 's OK . It 's OK . You can admit it . I was worried ... about the rig . I 've got over 4 years invested in this project . Yeah , you only had 3 years invested in me . Well , you have to have priorities . It 's kinda messy , but , I guarantee you it 's the only bunk that won 't be occupied . You can get a couple of hours rest before we get there . What are you still wearing that for ? I don 't know . Divorce ain 't final . Forgot to take it off . I haven 't worn mine in months . Yeah . Well , ' what 's his name ' wouldn 't like it . The suit . Do you always have to call him that ? The suit . Makes you sound like such a hick . His name is Michael . How is Michael anyway ? Mr. Brooks Brothers . Mr. BMW . You still seeing him ? No . No , I haven 't seen him in a few weeks . Terribly sorry . What happened ? Why are you doing this ? This is ... this is none of your business ! It 's not a part of your life any more . I 'll tell you what happened . You woke up one morning in those satin sheets rolled over , and there was this good-looking guy . Well-groomed , expensive watch on . And you realized , " This guy never makes me laugh . " That 's it , Bud . That 's it ! Aren 't you clever ? Jesus ! You 're clever ! You know , you should start your own talk show or something ! Ask Dr. Bud . 'Advice to the Lovelorn from 300 Fathoms . ' Thank you . Thank you . Oh , shit ! - Cuttin ' you loose , Bud . - OK , One Night . Stay clear . We 're settin ' her down . Touchdown ! This is us , sitting right on the edge of the Cayman Trough . This is the Montana . 300 meters away , 70 meters below us . We think she slid down the wall and now sits here on this outcropping . So we 're gonna have to drop straight down ... here and ... This tell us how much radiation we 're gettin ' ? Whoa whoa whoa ! I 'm not going near no radiation ! No way ! - Ah Hippy , you pussy . - Yeah what good is the money 6 months later your dick drops off . We 'll take readings as we go . If the reactor 's breached the warheads have released any radioactive debris , we 'll just back off . - It 's that simple . - Oh , OK . OK . Hippy 's not going , so , McWhirter , you can run Little Geek . Oh goddamn it ! You know McWhirter can 't run an ROV worth shit ! Then you 'd better go . I 'll go . What is your problem huh ? On this dive you 'll do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me . And you 'll follow those orders without discussion . Is that clear ? All right , I want everyone to finish prep and ready to get wet in 15 minutes . - One of you guys gimme a hand loading Little Geek , OK ? - Let 's get suited up . Hey , guys , guys ! Hold it a second . Hold it ! Whoa ! Look uh it 's 3 am . These guys are running on bad coffee and about 4 hours of sleep . Maybe you could think about cuttin ' them some slack . - I can 't afford slack . - Hey you come on my rig , you don 't talk to me you start ordering my people around . It 's not gonna work . You gotta know how to handle these people . We got a certain way of doing things around here . Right now , I 'm not interested in your way of doing things . Just get your team ready to dive . These guys have got no sense of humor . Bud , do you know your hand is blue ? Finler , why don 't you just shut up and put your gear on ? Keep it coming . - Hippy , throw me 1 of them cyalumes , please . - Yeah sure . - Good . - Excuse me . - What is all this stuff ? - Fluid Breathing System . We just got them . - You use it when you go really deep . - How deep ? - Deep . - How deep ? It 's classified . Anyway you breathe liquid so you can 't get compressed . - The pressure doesn 't get you . - You mean you got liquid in your lungs ? Oxygenated , fluorocarbon ... - ... emulsion . - Bullshit ! Check this out . - Can I borrow your rat ? - What are you doin ' ? You 're gonna ... you 're gonna kill her ! - It 's OK . I 've done this myself . - Man ! You 're just drowning her ? She 's gonna be fine . I 've breathed this myself . - It 's gonna be fine . - No , man . She 's gonna drown ! - Look , look ! She 's freaking out ! - Just goin ' through a normal adjustment period . Normal ! ? Does this look normal to you ? She 's gonna drown ! He 's taking the fluid into his lungs . He 's taking the fluid into his lungs . There he goes . Still has a bit of anxiety here . Now he 's starting to relax . He 's breathing fine . See his chest moving ? - He 's getting plenty of oxygen . - Damn rat 's breathing that shit . That is , no bullshit , hands down , the goddamndest thing I ever saw . See the fluid 's harder to push in and out than air . It 's a little more work to breathe . But he 's doing fine . He 's diggin ' it . She 's doin ' it . She ain 't diggin ' it . All right , let her out now ! - Now ! - OK . All right . OK . Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs . All right . Give her here . Give her here . Here 's your rat . - See ? He 's fine ! - It 's a she . Going over the wall . Coming to bearing 0-6-5 . Flatbed , you online ? 10-4 , Lindsey . We read you loud and clear . Starting our descent . Divers , how you doin ' ? Everybody 's OK so far . Hang on , boys . It 's all downhill from here . - Hey , how deep 's the drop-off here ? - This here 's the bottomless pit , baby . 2 and a half miles straight down . Cab 3 , it 's Bud . You on line ? Cab 3 check . I 'm right behind you . Cab 1 , do you see it yet ? Magnetometer 's twitching , but I don 't see anything yet . Hang on . I 'm gonna test my strobes . Cab 1 , do you have a visual ? - Cab 1 , do you copy ? - Uh yeah . Roger that . Found it . Cab 1 , radiation readings ? Neutron counter 's not showing much . All right . Just continue forward along the hull . Copy that . Continuing forward . You want me to get shots of everything , yes ? Roger that . Document as much as you can . But , please , keep moving . Remember , we 're on a tight time line . Copy that . Coming up to the mid-ship 's hatch . Do you see it , Cab 3 ? Yeah , roger . I got it . - How do you want me ? - Just hold above it . - Roger . Holding . - OK . It 's all yours , Lieutenant . - All right , ' A Team . ' - Let 's do it . OK . Perry , Hippy . - Let 's get that R.O.V. launched . - OK . We 're on it , boss . Go ! Little Geek is on the case . Monk here , sir . We got the mid-ship 's outer hatch open . Entering escape trunk . Inner hatch looks intact . It 's flooded . All right . I 'm gonna open her up . OK . Get in there . - Roger . Somebody get on that tether . - Got it . Sorry about this , little buddy , but better you than me . You know what I mean ? Coffey , these are the missile hatches , right ? That 's right . It looks like a couple of the hatches have sprung . Radiation 's nominal . Warheads must still be intact . How many are there ? 24 Trident missiles . 8 MIRVs per missile . That 's 192 warheads , Coffey . How powerful are they ? Your MIRV is a tactical nuke . 50 kilotons nominal yield . Say ... 5 times Hiroshima . Jesus Christ ! It 's World War III in a can . Let 's knock off the chatter people . OK . I 'm headin ' into the reactor compartment . - Getting a reading ? - Uh it 's twitching . But it 's below the line you said was safe . All right . Let 's get in there . Flatbed , drop down starboard of the sail and stay along the cliff edge . OK . Copy that . Keep heading for the bow . OK , Flatbed . This looks good . Just set it down here . - We 're solid . - Let 's go . All right . Let 's go . OK . Let 's just take it slow and easy goin ' in . Don 't take any chances . Where are we , Coffey ? This is the forward berthing compartment . This way . - You guys OK ? Cat ? Jammer ? - Right behind you , Bud . Check your gauges . How 's your O2 ? - I 'm OK . - Yeah , gauges are good . OK . 16 minutes to go . Jammer here . CO2 is up . - Breathe slower , buddy . - I 'm OK . Come on . Let 's keep up . All right , up this way to the control center . It 's jammed ! Gimme a hand ! Get up here with that pry bar . It 's moving . Pull ! - Jesus ! - Oh God . All right ! We knew we were gonna see this . Just move on . - Jesus ! - Come on , Jammer . Let 's go . OK . Let 's stay cool . Everybody stay cool . We can 't help these guys , but we might find somebody further in . Stay here . Hey , Jammer . You OK ? - How you guys doin ' ? - I 'm dealin ' . Triple time sounded like a lot of money , Bud . It ain 't . We 're here . Let 's get it done , OK ? Brigman , take your men and continue aft . Split up into 2 teams . Come on . Let 's get moving . We head back in 14 minutes . Let 's go . You OK , Jammer ? Yeah , I 'm fine . - What 's this ? - Should be the missile launch control center . - Don 't touch anything . - No , no , n-n-n-n-no . This way . I 'm right behind you . - Still with me , Jammer ? - Where are we ? Missile compartment . Those are the launch tubes . Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Hey , Jammer . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! You OK ? Deep and slow , big guy . - Deep and slow . Just breathe easy . - Everybody 's dead ! - They 're all dead ! - OK . I 'm taking you back out . Let 's go . No . I 'm OK . I 'm OK . I just can 't go any further in . OK , Jammer . No problem . You stay right here . I 've gotta check out this compartment , all right ? We 'll stay in voice contact . You hold onto the end of this rope here . You have any problem whatsoever , you tug twice . - I got it . - Pull it hard . 5 more minutes . Just relax , all right ? You 'll be OK . - It 's OK . - Be right back . You still readin ' me OK , big guy ? Read you fine , Bud . OK . Just a few more minutes . There 's a couple of compartments up ahead that might have air . - OK . No problem . - We gotta be sure , right ? Hang on , Jammer . Just hold onto that ... Shit ! Bud ? Bud can you hear me ? Bud ? Bud ? Goddamn it ! Oh , Jesus ! Bud , is that you ? Hang on , Jammer . Lew ! Cat ! Hurry up , on the double ! I 'm on my way ! Jammer ! - What 's the problem ? - He 's convulsing ! It 's his mixture ! Too much oxygen ! Gotta get the O2 cut down ! Turn him over ! Crank it down , man ! You 're losing him ! All right . We 've gotta get him outta here ! Let 's go . Let 's move it . Easy , big fella . One Night , do you see the divers ? Are they out yet ? Negative , Lindsey . Haven 't seen hide nor hair . Let 's give ' em 2 minutes more max and then I 'll sound the diver recall . Meet me at Flatbed ! This is a diver emergency ! - Lins , do you copy ! - Yeah , copy you , Bud . I 'm on my way . Look , I 'm just a medic . Which is mostly about patching holes . This type of thing , it 's there 's not much I can do . The coma could last hours or days . No , I didn 't get a picture of it . - What about the video ? - No . We lost power right then . Look , I just don 't wanna talk about this , OK ? Fine . Be that way . Look , I don 't know what I saw , Bud , OK ? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible - fine . It 's a Russian submersible . No problem . Yeah , but you think it was something else . What ? One of ours ? No . Well , whose then ? Come on , Lindsey . Talk to me . Look , Jammer saw something down there . - Something that scared the hell out of him . - His mixture got screwed up . Jammer panicked . He pranged his regulator and his mixture got screwed up . But what did he see that made him panic ? Well , what do you think he saw ? I don 't know . - Did any of you see it ? - No , sir . The Brigman woman saw it . Could have been a Russian bogey . CINCLANTFLT 's gonna go apeshit . 2 Russian attack subs , a Tango and a Victor , were tracked to within 50 miles of here . And now they don 't know where the hell they are . OK . I don 't have any choice . I 'm confirming you to go to Phase 2 . You 'll recover 1 warhead , arm it , and wait for further instructions . - Have we got a problem with that ? - Negative , sir . Come on ! - What did he say ? - Turn it up , bozo ! ... early reports that the Montana encountered a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking and the Kremlin continues to deny any involvement . That 's us ! That 's us , man ! Benthic Petroleum are apparently participating in the recovery operation but we have little information about their involvement . We want names ! Hey , that 's the Explorer ! We 're famous ! There is a tremendous amount of activity . With Cuba only 80 miles away , the massive build-up of American forces has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow . Russian and Cuban trawlers , undoubtedly surveillance vessels have been circling the area ... - ... and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away . - This sucks ! - Hippy , what 's the matter with you ? - What 's the matter with me ? Nothing ! We 're just in the middle of some big-time international incident ... - ... like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something ! - Figured that out for yourself , did you Hip ? You know , we got Russian subs creeping around . Anything goes wrong , they could say whatever they want happened . Relax , will you ? You 're making the women nervous . - Cute , Virgil . - You know , you know those seals ain 't telling ' us diddly . Something is goin ' on ! - Come on , come on . - Hippy , you think everything 's a conspiracy . Everything is . Hurry up , Coffey 's splitting with Flatbed ! I showed him how to work the controls and they 're outta here ! - Didn 't you tell him we need it right now ? - Yeah ! He didn 't pay any attention ! - Where the hell is he takin ' it ? - I have no idea ! Shit ! Coffey ! Come back ! We need the big arm to unhook the umbilical . There 's a goddamn hurricane coming ! - He switched off . - It 's unbelievable . Go back down and tell those men to get below and stay there ! We need to get unhooked and get out of here now ! - All right . Do it , then . - No problem , except your boys went sightseeing with Flatbed . My people need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end . - Back in 2 hours . - 2 hours ? ! We 're gonna get the shit kicked out of us by our pal Fred in 2 hours ! OK . Set cold tab fitting to 200 psi . - Set . - There she goes . - She 's breakin ' loose . - Bringin ' her up . OK . All right . 'K Clear the hatch . Go on with it . Go on . That 's it . Up . Sir , the missile looks intact . Little is known about the events leading up to the collision . The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class destroyer in low visibility conditions . In violent seas , little hope remains for over 100 Russian crewmen still missing after the sinking an hour ago . Soviet military spokesmen have claimed that the collision constituted an unprovoked attack . - This was denied by state department officials ... - Bud , this is big time . ... who said that Captain Michael Sweeney was acting correctly ... - OK . It 's clear . - It 's all yours , sir . I 'm gonna swing it away and drop it . Check . OK . Bypass the ground connection on the separation sequencer . - Got it ? - Separation sequencer disconnected . Remove explosive bolts 1 through 6 ... - ... in counterclockwise sequence . - Check . Removing bolt 1 . Negotiators have walked out of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in protest over the incident this morning . The sudden deterioration of relations with the United States and the Soviet ... Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has continued . ... Eastern-Time this morning , all US and NATO military forces have been put on full alert . It 's on every channel . Well , you just feel so helpless . You can see it coming , but what can you do ? What can anyone do ? Hey , I mean , they love their kids too . So why are we doing this ? If it happens , it happens . There 's nothing I can do about it , right ? I just don 't think about it . All right ! Let 's get their gear off ! Then clear the sub ! We gotta get it outta here ! Come on , let 's go ! Let 's move it ! One Night , you 're up ! Get ready to roll , baby ! - Don 't touch that ! Just back away . - Excusé moi ! Hey , Coffey . We 're a little pressed for time . Prick . This ain 't no drill , Slick . Make me proud . Piece of cake , baby . What 's the problem , One Night ? All hell must be breaking loose up there . This cable 's pissin ' me off ! - I can 't get a grip on it . - Well , keep tryin ' , baby . Just keep tryin ' . Son of a bitch ! Shit ! We got a problem ! - What 's going on ? - We 're losing number 2 thruster ! Bearing 's going ! It 's not holding ! We 're swinging out of position here ! Jesus ! Shit ! The rig is movin ' ! Yeah , I can see that . Topside ! Topside , pay out some slack ! We 're gettin ' dragged ! - Down on number 1 winch ! - We 're gettin ' dragged ! Down on 1 ! Bud , we 're headed right for the drop-off ! What the hell ? We just lost all the topside feeds ! Shit ! Get ' em on the UQC . - Any damage on the hull ? - Bud ! - We lost the crane ! - Say again . What ? The crane ! We 've lost the crane ! It 's on its way down to you ! All right , everybody ! Everybody rig for impact ! Close all the exterior hatches ! Let 's move it ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - Wait ! - Get in here ! - What the hell is goin ' on around here ! ? - I don 't know ! You two help secure the rig ! Let 's go ! One Night ! One Night ! You gotta get the hell outta there ! The crane 's comin ' down ! I 'm OK . I 'm clear , Bud . I 've got it ! It 's headed straight for us ! Oh , shit ! - Oh no ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! - Oh my God . Bud ? Grab onto something ! Jesus ! - Battery room 's flooding ! Let 's go ! - Cat , put that out ! - Bud ! The drill room 's flooding ' ! - Get back down there ! Go ! I 'll take the battery room ! Jesus ! Shit ! - Get out of there ! - Close the door ! Seal the room ! Lindsey ! Let 's get outta here ! - Hold this on me ! - OK ! Lindsey ! I got it ! Let 's get the hell outta here ! Let 's go ! Hit the door ! Hit the door ! No ! Bud ! Bud ! Finler , cut the hose ! Cut the line to the motor ! I can 't open it from out here ! Finler , cut the hose ! Finler ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - Come on , Sonny ! - Hey , Cat ! Cat , help me out , man ! Hang on ! The hose ! Cut the hose ! The line to the motor ! Hurry up , man ! Come on , Cat ! Hurry ! Come on , Sonny ! Help me out ! Come on ! Push ! - Come on , Sonny ! Let 's go ! - Come on ! Let 's go ! We gotta go ! Go ! Go ! Get outta here ! Come on ! Move it ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Get the hatch , Cat ! Get the hatch ! Get the hatch ! - You all right ? Everybody OK ? - Yeah . Son of a bitch ! Oh , man ! Benthic Explorer , Benthic Explorer . This is Deepcore . Do you read me ? Over . Forget it , Sonny . They 're gone , man . - Mayday , Mayday , Mayday . - Hey . They 're gone . OK ? I just wanna get out of this . I 'd just like to see my wife one more time . Well , all right , then . You 'd better keep trying , huh ? Mayday , Mayday , Mayday . This is Deepcore 2 . Do you read ? Benthic Explorer , Benthic Explorer . Do you read me ? This is Deepcore 2 . Over . Mayday , Mayday , Mayday . Deepcore 2 do you read me ? Over . Hey , Jammer . - You got the shakes . - I know what I got . I 'll deal with it , all right ? I 'll deal with me . You deal with yourself . Find your buddy ? - No . - Tighter , tighter . - Brigman . - What ? I was under orders . I had no choice . How 's it going , Cat ? - What 's the scoop , ace ? - Well I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I reroute these buses . But I gotta get past the mains , which are a total meltdown . Bud , there won 't be enough to run the heaters . In a few hours , this place is gonna be as cold as a meat locker . - What about O2 ? - Yeah , well , brace yourself . If we close off the sections we 're not using , we have about maybe 12 hours ' worth . The storm 's gonna last a lot longer than 12 hours . Yeah , well I can maybe extend that . Maybe . There are some storage tanks outboard next to the wrecked module . I 'll have to go outside , though , and tie onto them . Hey , Lins . - Lins . - Yeah ? I 'm glad you 're here . Yeah ? I 'm not . Hey . Found Cab 3 . Deader than dog shit , boss . That girder went right through the brainpan . Yeah , I see that . - Where are you ? - Living quarters . Level 2 . Ah jeez ! That 's Perry . That 's it , then . Finler , McWhirter , Dietz and Perry . Jesus . Uh ... we just leave ' em there ? Yeah , for now . We got no choice . Our first priority is to get somethin ' to breathe . Where are you now , Lins ? I 'm under the starboard tri-module . - Still with me , Hip ? - Right behind you , Lins . - How 's it look ? - Well , you guys really screwed up my rig . - There 's a lot of wreckage out here . - Well , don 't get fouled . - Hey hit me with that 9 / 16ths , OK ? - Yeah . Thank you . So ... - ... there you were . - Yeah , there we were . Side by side on the same ship for 2 months . I 'm a tool pusher and we 're testing this automated derrick of hers . We get back on the beach and we 're livin ' together . Doesn 't mean you had to marry her . Yeah , well we were due to go back out on the same ship . 6 months of tests . If you were married , you got a stateroom . Otherwise it was bunks . OK . Good reason . Will you come over here and tighten this for me ? Then what ? Then it was all right there for a while , you know . Then she got promoted to chief engineer on this thing a couple years ago . - She went front office on you , man . - Yeah , well , you know Lindsey . She 's just too damn aggressive . Son of a bitch ! She didn 't leave me . She just left me behind . Bud , let me tell you somethin ' . She ain 't half as smart as she thinks she is . Get outta here . Come on . Let 's see those muscles . Bingo ! That 's 1 . 2 for 2 . Hey , hey . Lindsey , do you read me ? Over . Copy you , Hippy . What 's the matter ? Oh , shit . The power 's jackin ' around with us again . Lindsey , come back . I just lost video . Lins , are you there ? Hippy , do you copy ? Lins , you copy ? Oh , shit ! Oh , what the hell ! Hippy , do you copy ? Damn it ! Bud , do you copy ? Over . Uh ... I seem to be having a problem here . Shit ! Damn it ! - That 's a great shot , Lins . - You drop your dive light ? Oh come on you guys , come on . Now that 's the smaller one . That 's the smaller one here . - You can kinda see how it 's zigging around . - Yea , whatever it is . I 'm telling you what it is . You 're just not hearing me . - Now , Lindsey you ... - There is something down there . - Something not us . - You could be more ... specific . - Something that zigs . - Not us . Not human . Get it ? Something non-human ... but intelligent . A non-terrestrial intelligence . A non-terrestrial intelligence . NTIs . Oh , man , that 's better than UFOs . Oh but that works too huh . Underwater Flying Objects . - Are we talking little space friends here ? - Hell , yeah ! Hot rods of the gods ! Right , Lins ? No , no , really . It could be NTIs . - The CIA has known about ' em for ever . - Step outside . - They abduct people all the time , man . There was once ... - Hippy , would you do me a favor ? Stay off my side . - Will you step into my office , please ? - Certainly . I ... come here . - Jesus , Lins ! - Oh Bud , come on ! Something really important is happening here . I 'm trying to keep the situation under control . I can 't allow you to create this kind of hysteria . - Who 's hysterical ? ! Nobody 's hysterical ! - Shh ! All I 'm saying is , when you 're hanging on by your fingernails , you don 't go waving your arms around . Look , I saw something . I 'm not gonna go in there and say I didn 't see it when I did . I 'm sorry . - Please . - You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew . Yes , I am ! But I need you to believe me right now . Now , come on . Look at me . Come on . Am I stressed out ? Do I have any symptoms of pressure - sickness , tremors , slurred speech ? - No . - No . Bud , this is me - Lindsey . OK ? You know me better than anybody in the world . Now watch my lips . I saw these things . I touched one of them . And ... it wasn 't some clunky steel can like we would build . It glided . It was the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . Oh , God , I wish you 'd been there . It was a machine . It was a machine , but it was alive . It was like a ... like a dance of light . Please . You have to trust me . Now , I don 't think they mean us any harm . I don 't know how I know that . It 's just ... a feeling . Jesus ! I 'm supposed to go on a feeling ? How can I go on a feeling ? - You think Coffey 's gonna go on a feeling ? - Well , we all see what we wanna see . Coffey looks and he sees Russians . He sees hate and fear . You have to look with better eyes than that . Please . I can 't , Lins . I 'm sorry . All I want is 24 hour surveillance on exterior cameras . - You 've got 6 people . I 've got ... - Comin ' through ! Everybody just stop ! All right . I want around-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras . That Russian bogey comes back ... - ... I don 't think we should be taking a nap . - Give me a break , Coffey . Those things live 3 and a half miles down in an abyssal trench . Trust me , they 're not speaking Russian . Have you finished the repairs ... - ... on the acoustical transmitter yet ? - Nope . - Why not ? - I was having my nails done . Well , get it done . Kiss my ass . All right . Get something straight . You people are under my authority . Look , partner ... look partner . We don 't work for you . We don 't take orders from you . And we don 't much like you . Hey , Cat ... Cat ! Yeah ? Why don 't you take the first watch on sonar ? OK ? Right on . Sonny , you get a couple of hours ' sleep . Then you spell Cat , all right ? Hippy , you handle exterior surveillance . One Night ... Will you do me a favor and see if you can get that transmitter fixed ? - All right ? - Give me a couple of hours . Got it . All right . Come on , AJ Squared Away . A little to the left . What is ? Oh , this is not happening . Look at me , I 'm shaking man . All right . Wait wait wait wait . And now here 's MIRV ! - Oh , come on , man ! What else could it be ? - Why bring it here ? It 's gotta be some kind of emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians , right ? Look look ... they hot-wire 1 of the nukes . They use some kind of detonator that they brought . Then they stick it back in the sub . Fry the whole thing up . Bam ! Slicker than snot . I 'm tellin ' you . And I 'm not being paranoi ... Hi , Lins . - Lins , will you just wait a second ? - Goddamn it , If you don 't do something about it , I will ! - Lindsey , we 'll do something about it ! Wait a sec ! - Fellas ! ? Hello ! - Lins ! Just stop and think about this for a second . - About what ? You know , you 've got some huevos bringing that thing into my rig . With all that 's goin ' on up in the world , you bring a nuclear weapon ... - ... in here ! - Mrs. Brigman ... Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic , or is it just me ? Mrs. Brigman , you don 't need to know the details of our operation . - It 's better if you don 't . - You 're right ! I don 't need to know ! What I need to know is that thing is off this rig ! Do you hear me , Roger Ramjet ! ? You 're becoming a serious impediment to our mission . Now , you either do an about-face and walk out of here , or I 'll have you escorted out . I will not do an about-face and get outta here ! - Who the hell do you think you 're talking to ? - Emergency ! Maintenance Room B ! Emergency ! Everybody move it ! On the double ! Now ! Now ! - In here ! Come on ! We got trouble ! Now ! Come on ! - What 's goin ' on ? All right ! All right ! All right ! All right ! - What 's up ? What 's happening ? - All right , you let her go , man . Do it . Do it now ! Let her go . The smartest thing you ever did . - Coffey , you son of a bitch ! - Lindsey ! Cool it . - What 's the problem ? - Nothing . We were just leaving . Weren 't we ? We don 't need them . We can 't trust them . We may have to take steps . We 're gonna have to take steps . Lins , I want you to stay away from that guy . I mean it . The guy is gone . Did you see his hands ? What ? He 's got the shakes ? Look , he 's operating on his own . He 's cut off from his chain of command . He 's showing signs of pressure-induced psychosis . And he 's got a nuclear weapon . So , as a personal favor to me , will you try to put your tongue in neutral for a while ? - OK ? - I gotta tell you . I give this whole thing a sphincter factor of about 9.5 . You can just punch into his primary guidance chip where you want him to go ... - ... and he 'll go there , right ? - No . Bad idea , Lindsey . Why , Hip ? Come on . Because even if it could take the pressure at that depth , which I don 't think it can without the tether , you know what would happen if it got down there ? It would just sit like a ... please ... it would just sit like a dumb shit . - Yeah ... something would have to pass in front of the camera for you to see anything . - I know . I know . But we could get lucky right ? So we should go for it . I really ought to talk to Bud about this . No way . This is between you and me . We get proof and then we tell the others . Hippy , look . If we can prove to Coffey that there aren 't Russians down there maybe he 'll ease off the button a little bit . I gotta tell you , that guy scares me more than anything we 're gonna find down there . He 's a goddamn AJ squared away jarhead robot ! All right . All right . Give me a couple of hours . I 'll see what I can do . Great . Thanks . How 's that ? Thanks . Virgil , turn on your side . All right . You 're all set , big guy . Hey , I told you to wipe that grin off your face . Good night , little buddy . Bud ! Bud ! Get up ! Cat ? Cat ! Hey ! Goddamn ... leave me alone . Bud ! No , wait . It 's OK . Sweet Christ almighty ! I think it likes you . It 's trying to communicate . It 's Bud . - It 's wonderful ! - It 's me ! - No no no no no ! - Shh it 's OK . It 's OK . What is it ! ? Is it alive ? Lindsey , no ... Seawater . Oh , man . Come on ! Come on ! - Hurry ! - Where the hell 's it going ? Hurry ! I think it 's headed for B module ! Lins , you see it ? So , raise your hand if you think it was a Russian water tentacle . Lieutenant ? No ? Well a breakthrough . Hey , ace ... - ... you done impressing yourself ? - No way that thing could just be seawater . They must have learned to control water . I mean , at a molecular level . You know , they can plasticize it , they can pulverize it , do whatever they wanna do with it . - They can put it under intelligent control . - Maybe ... their whole technology 's based on that ... controlling water . Was it the same thing that you saw the last time ? No . You know , I don 't think that that thing you saw was one of them . - What are you talkin ' about ? - I mean , I don 't think it was an NTI . I think it was like their version of an ROV . Like Big Geek . Hippy , you mean they was just checkin ' us out ? - Yeah . - How come ? Curious , I suppose . We 're probably the first people they 've ever seen right ? Who 's been down this far ? It went straight for the warhead . And they think it 's cute ! You need to get some sleep . We have no way of warning the surface . And you know what that means ? It means whatever happens is up to us . Us . So you think they 're from down there originally ? Or from you know . I don 't know . I think ... I think they 're from , ' you know . ' Someplace with similar conditions . - Cold , intense pressure . - Oh , man ! Happy as hogs in a waller down there , probably . Sniff something ? Did you , rat boy ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Come on ! Freeze ! Don 't move ! That 's right . - You OK , Hip ? - They 're using Big Geek ... - ... to take the bomb to the NTIs . - What ? We set it up to go right to ' em . Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Take this . We 're going to Phase 3 . What ! ? We don 't have orders for that ! I programmed Big Geek to go down to the bottom of the trench and shoot some video . - Now they got the warhead tied to it . - Coffey . - Lins ... - Coffey ... no , come on , Coffey . Just think about what you 're doing , OK ? Just 1 minute . Just think about what you 're doing ! Get back ! This is something I 've wanted to do since we first met . Come on . Take it easy . Take it easy . - All right ! Into the kitchen ! Let 's go ! Move ! - Get your damn hands off of me ! - Get in there ! - I know the way . Your boss is fixin ' to pull the pin on 50 kilotons ! And we 're all gonna be ringside ! He 's havin ' a full-on meltdown ! - What 's the timer set for ? - 3 hours . - Shut up ! Don 't talk . - 3 hours . We can 't get to minimum safe distance in 3 hours . We can 't go to Phase 3 . What about these people ? Shut up ! What 's the matter with you ? Everybody just stay calm . The situation is under control . Anybody touches that door , kill ' em . Shoenick ! Your lieutenant 's about to make a real bad career move ! - The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat ! - Shut it ! - They 're trying to make contact ! - Can 't you see he 's lost it ? - Shut up ! - The shock wave will kill us . - Quiet ! It 'll crush this rig like a beer can . - Shut up , man ! What are you talkin ' about ! ? - We gotta stop him . Shut up ! This is not our mission . We can 't detonate without orders . He 's about to declare war on an alien species just when they 're trying to make contact with us . Please ! - I don 't know . I think I 'm reaching him . - Yeah ! I 'll be damned . - Jammer . - Is everybody OK ? Oh , man ! - Don 't move , jarface ! - Look , I 'm the least of your problems . - Take it easy , Hippy . - I 'm all right . - How you feeling , big guy ? I 'm OK , Bud . I I just ... I just figured I was dead back there when I saw that angel coming for me . Yeah , OK . Yeah . Why don 't you tell us about it later ? - Come on . - He 's got it tied off with something . Yeah come on . Ready ? - We 're not gonna be able to budge it . - Now what ? This is the only door to sub-bay . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna swim to hatch 6 . What ! ? I 'm gonna get inside ... - ... and I 'm gonna open the door from the other side . - Bud , this water is freezing . Then I guess you 'd better wish me luck , huh ? - Wish us luck . - You comin ' along ? Looks that way . - All right , Cat . - Come on , Bud . - In case I don 't die ... - This is insane . Come on , Bud . Let 's go , partner . I ain 't got all day . Come on . Yank on it . We have to we have to go to the moon pool . - It 's the only way . - I can 't . I can 't make it , partner . I 'm sorry . OK ... OK Cat . You head on back , all right ? - What is he doing ? - He can 't make it to the door . - He 's gonna try and take him out himself . - No . God , he couldn 't be that dumb . That guy 's a trained killer . No ! Coffey ... Coffey , listen . Hey ! Hey ! - Bud , you all right ? - Get him , Cat ! - He 's dogged it , Bud ! - We gotta get this off of here . Come on . Help me . Pull the gripper ! Cat , get the door ! Shit ! Come on ! Shoot ! You all right ? The safety 's on ! Safety 's on ! Give me that ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Help me out ! Gimme a hand . Let 's move it . - One Night , what about Cab 1 ? - Ready to launch . Go ! You 're better in these than I am . - You got air ? - Come on . Come on ! You got air . You got air . You got air . You got air . Shit ! Bud , get out of the way ! Shit ! Get in ! Hurry up ! I 'm comin ' , baby ! Keep your pantyhose on . - Are you OK ? - Yeah . - Do you see Big Geek ? - Yeah . Right out in front . - Oh , my God ! - Get after him . - OK . OK . OK . OK . Get on the arm . - To the left . A little more . - You missed . Try it again . - Stay steady . Steady . Steady . Steady . - OK . - Grab it ! - Yeah , got it ! - Pretty slick , Slick . - Hold it really steady . - Hold it still . Hold it still . - I am . I am . Shit ! We lost Geek ! Where is he , Bud ? Do you see him ? I 'll take a look . - He 's comin ' up fast . Step on it ! - Shit ! - Go to the right ! Swing to the right ! - Shit ! Keep movin ' , baby ! Come here . Son of a bitch ! Hard left , baby ! Left ! Left ! Left ! Jesus Christ , lady ! Bud , if you think you can do any better then you 're welcome up here ! Son of a bitch ! - Is he right on us ? - Yeah , he 's right on your ass . OK . OK . - Where you goin ' ? - Hang on ! Deepcore , this is Cab 1 . Do you read ? Deepcore , Deepcore , this is Cab 1 . Over . I 'm not getting any answer ! And we 're flooding like a son of a bitch . Yeah . You noticed ? You know , you did OK back there , Virgil . - I was fairly impressed . - Yeah , well , not good enough . - We still gotta catch Big Geek . - Yeah , well , not in this thing . Deepcore , Deepcore , this is Cab 1 . Over . Try it again . Deepcore , this is Cab 1 . We need a ... You all right ? Yeah . Well , that 's that . Yeah , wonderful . There 's some light comin ' from somewhere . Off to the right . Yeah , that 's the rig . It 's a good 60 , 70 yards , I 'd say . Well , they 'll come after us . Yeah , but it 's gonna take ' em a while to get here . We gotta get this flooding stopped . - Can you see where it 's coming in ? - Yeah . Can you hold the lamp for me ? There 's a busted fitting behind this panel . Problem is I don 't think I can get to it . - You got any tools ? - Uh , I don 't know . I 'll have to look around . Yeah , well , I looked already . Goddamn it ! All I need 's a goddamn crescent wrench ! Come on . Son of a bitch ! OK . Calm down , Bud . - Calm down . - OK . - OK . OK . We gotta get you outta here . - How ? - I don 't know how . - All right . We 've only got 1 suit . - I know . I know . But we gotta come up with something . - Oh , my God ! I 'm freezing ! - Come here . Come here . Give me your hands . - All right . We 've only got 1 suit . - I know . I know . But we gotta come up with something . - Oh , my God ! I 'm freezing ! - Come here . Come here . Give me your hands . - Listen , you 're smart . Think of something . Can 't you think of something ? - OK . OK . OK . Why don 't you swim back to the rig and bring back another suit ? That 'll take me about 7 , or 8 minutes to swim , get the gear , and come back . I wouldn 't make it . Look at this . By the time I got back , you 'd be ... - OK . OK . - Lins . - Let 's look around . Let 's look . Oh my God ! Is that working ? Shit ! All right . All right . All right . All right . All right . Here . You put this on . - No ! No ! What , are you growing gills all of a sudden ? - Don 't argue with me , goddamn it ! Just put it on . - Look , this is not an option , so just forget about it ! All right ? - Lindsey , shut up ! Shut up and put this thing on ! - If you 'd be logical just for 1 second ... - Fuck logic ! - Please ! Listen ... Just listen to me for 1 second . Now , you 've got the suit on and you 're a better swimmer than I am , right ? - Yeah , maybe . - Right ? Yes ! So I 've got a plan . - What 's the plan ? - I drown , and you tow me back to the rig . No . No ! - Yes ! This water 's ... - No ! - ... only a couple of degrees above freezing . I 'll ... go into deep hypothermia . My blood will go like ice water . Right ? My body systems will slow down . They won 't stop . - Lins ... - You tow me back and I can ... I can be revived after maybe ... - ... 10 or 15 minutes . - Lins , put this on ! You put it on ! - No , it 's the only way ! You just put this on ! Put this on . You know I 'm right . - 10 or 15 minutes . - Lins , put this on ! You put it on ! No , it 's the only way ! You just put this on ! Put this on . You know I 'm right . Please ! It 's the only way . You 've got all the ... stuff on the rig to do this . Put this on . Bud , please ! - This is insane . - I know . Oh , my God . - Are you OK ? - It 's the only way . All right . Here . Hold this . Son of a bitch . Hold on , Lindsey . You can do this , you know . - You can do this . - God , Lins ... I ... I know . You can tell me later . This is maybe not such a good idea ! Oh , my God ! Bud ! No ! I can 't ! Oh , Bud , I 'm scared ! NO ! I got him ! I got him ! - Where ? - Oh , my God ! It 's Lindsey . - Deepcore ! Deepcore , do you read ? Over . - Yeah , we got you , Bud . - We 're here . - Go to the infirmary . Get the cart , oxygen , defib ' kit adrenaline in a 10cc syringe , and some heating blankets . You got all that ? - Got it . - Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast ! Now ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Hippy , get the hot packs ! Got ' em ! Here he comes ! - Watch her head .

You 're never wrong , are you ? How you feelin ' ? I feel better . What did you do to me ? Next time it 's your turn , OK ? Yeah , you got that right . OK , these are so your eyes can focus in the breathing fluid . How 's that feel ? If you can 't see , you can 't disarm the bomb right ? OK . With this much weight , you 're gonna fall like a brick . We 've still got about an hour , so you should get there in plenty of time . When you get down there , all you gotta do is cut 1 wire , drop the weights and come on home . - Hand me that wrench over there will ya ? - Maybe I oughta check out everything . That 's loose . I 'll fix that up . Bud , you don 't have to do this . Somebody 's gotta do it . Well it doesn 't have to be you . Who then ? So , what , I can hear you but I can 't talk , right ? The fluid prevents the larynx from making sound . Excuse me . - It 'll feel a little strange . - Yeah , no shit . I gotta warn you all ... I 'm a pretty lousy typist . The moment of truth . - Come on . Let 's go . - Let 's go . Easy . - I need it in the front a little bit . - OK . - Thank you . - You got it . - Set . - Set . - Clamp ? Set . OK , let 's rock and roll ! Crack it . - Headset ... - Headset , please . - OK . - Relax now , Bud . Just relax . - Bud . - Relax now , Bud . Watch me . - Relax . - OK ? Watch me . Watch me . - OK . Doin ' fine . No , don 't hold your breath . Take it in . Just let yourself take it in . Take it in . - That 's it . - Oh man . - Don 't hold your breath now . Take it in . There you go . Don 't hold your breath . Take it in . That 's it . - There you go . - Bud ! This is not normal ! It 's normal ! It 'll pass in a second ! It 's perfectly normal ! - This is normal ? - It 's perfectly normal . We all breathe liquid for 9 months , Bud . Your body will remember . That 's it . That 's it . - Perfectly normal . - Oh my , Christ ! He 's breathing ! Give me that . - Can you hear me ? - There he goes . - Yes ? Yes ? - He 's got it . That 's it . - OK . Bud ... Try your keypad . I already have . - OK . - Great . Let 's go ! - OK . - OK , Hippy , you got that ? - Hold on , Jammer . Easy . Easy . Watch out . Watch his side . Watch the back . Careful . I redid Little Geek 's chip the same as Big Geek ! It should take you straight there ! All you have to do is hang on ! What 's his depth ? - 3,200 feet . - Your depth is 3,200 feet . You 're doing fine . Now , you better watch out for crane wreckage . You should , you should be almost to it . 4,800 feet . It 's official . Yeah . Bud , according to Monk here , you just set a record for the deepest suit dive . Bet you didn 't think you 'd be doing this when you got up this morning , huh ? 1 mile down . Still grinning ' . 8,500 feet . 8,500 feet , Bud . Everything OK ? Ask him about pressure effects . Tremors , vision problems , euphoria . Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel . It 's starting . It hits the nervous system first . Keep talking Lindsey . Let him hear your voice . OK , Bud . Your depth is 8,900 feet . - You 're doing fine . - No , Lindsey . Talk to him . Bud there 's some ... some things I need to say . It 's hard for me , you know . It 's not easy being a cast-iron bitch . It takes discipline and years of training . A lot of people don 't appreciate that . Jesus , I 'm sorry I can 't tell you these things to your face . I have to wait till you 're alone in the dark freezing , and there 's 10,000 feet of water between us . I 'm sorry . I 'm , I 'm rambling . Comin ' up on the big ten thou ' . 12,000 feet . Jesus ! - I don 't believe he 's doin ' this ! - Hippy ! Shut up ! What 's wrong with you ? Bud , how are you doing ? Signal 's fading . No ! No , Bud , I 'm not going away . I 'm right here . Kill everything we don 't need . Uh , Catfish , knock out those exterior lights . Come on now . Go ! Go ! Run it through the digital processor ! Cook it as much as you can ! I am right here with you , Bud . Bud , this is Lindsey . Please . I 'm right here with you . OK ? So try and stay calm . I 'm right here , all right ? Bud . He 's losing it . - Talk to him .

Please . 17,000 feet . Christ almighty , this is insane . Bud ? I 'm not getting anything ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Oh come on ! No ! No ! - What ? What ! ? - Little Geek just folded . - Oh , Jesus . He can still make it . OK . Bud ? I know how alone you feel . Alone in all that ... cold ... blackness . But I 'm there in the dark with you . Oh , Bud . You 're not alone . Oh , God ! You remember that time you were pretty drunk . You probably don 't remember . But the power went out in that little apartment we had on Orange Street . We were staring at that 1 little candle and I , I said something really dumb like " That candle is me , " like like everyone of us is out there alone in the dark in this life . And you just ... you just lit up another candle and you put it beside mine and you said , " no . See , that 's me . That 's me . " And we stared at the 2 candles and then well , if you remember any of this , I 'm sure you remember the next part . But there are 2 candles in the dark . I 'm with you . I 'll always be with you , Bud . I promise that . How you doin ' partner ? You still with us ? Come back . You talk to us , Buddy boy . - Come on . - Bud ? Talk to me , Bud . Now , come on . You hangin ' in there ? You just ... you have to talk to me , Bud ! Please ! I need to know if you 're OK . You s ... you see light ? What kind of light , Bud ? He 's hallucinating badly . - He made it . - Oh , my God . - ... man . OK , Bud . We 'll go step by step . Remove the detonator housing by unscrewing it counterclockwise . All right , Bud . You have to cut the ground wire . Not the lead wire . It 's the blue wire with the white stripe . Not , I repeat not the black wire with the yellow stripe . Quiet ! Quiet ! Save your air . Bud , give me a reading off your liquid oxygen gauge . What ? - It took him 30 minutes just to get down there ! - Bud ! Do you hear me ? You drop your weights and start back now Bud ! That gauge could be wrong . Do you hear me ? Just drop your weights and start back now ! Your gauge could be wrong ! Your gauge could be wrong ! You drop your weights and start back now ! No , you won 't stay there . You drop your weights . You can breathe shallow ! Do you hear me ? Bud , please listen to me ! Please ! Goddamn it ! You dragged me back from that bottomless pit ! You can 't leave me here alone now . Please ! Oh , God , Virgil ! Please ! Please ! I love you . Howdy . Uh how are you guys doin ' ? Attempts to convene a summit between heads of state have collapsed ... The Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has ... All citizens to stay on their jobs , restrict unnecessary travel just moments ago is what officials are calling an unprovoked attack . Oh , shit ! Across the country , National Guard units have been mobilized and all civil defense volunteers have been called to full-time duty . You watch our TV . That 's what you 're telling me . - That you know what 's going on up there ? - Seismologists are reporting an enormous disturbance throughout the world 's oceans which apparently began about 15 minutes ago . They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis , but with no apparent seismological source . Uh , the waves are propagating towards the shorelines of every continent . - I 'm so sorry . That 's ... - Dr. Berg , would you please ... Young lady . Young lady , listen to me . I don 't know . We don 't know what 's going on yet . We don 't have a clue . The horizon has already grown dark . People are running everywhere . It 's , it 's sheer panic . Stay on me ! Uh , the wave ... the wave is , uh , I don 't know , maybe 1,000 feet high already . Getting bigger as I 'm watching still miles out . - Oh my God . - Get outta here ! We 're staying ! We 're staying ! Give it to me , then ! Uh , I don 't even know if I 'm still broadcasting . I can 't be sure . - I 'll just keep going as long as I can . Um ... - Get out of the way ! You guys are doing this . You guys are doing this , right ? You can control water . That 's your technology , but why are you doing this ? OK . That 's enough . I get the point ! How do you know they 're really gonna do it ? Where do you get off passing judgment on us ? You can 't be sure . How do you know ? You could 've done it . Why didn 't you ? Deepcore , do you read ? This is Benthic Explorer . Over . Do you hear , Deepcore ? Deepcore , do you read ? Do you read me , Deepcore ? Deepcore , do you read ? This is Benthic Explorer . Over . Hell , yes , we read ! Good of you to join us ! Copy , Deepcore . Hey , I 've got ' em ! How 's that storm goin ' up there ? Well , it 's strange , It just sort of blew itself out all of a sudden . Well , hell , son . You 'd better get a line down to us . We 're in moderately poor shape down here . We 've lost 7 people , including Bud . And we 're about out of O2 , so whatever you 're gonna do , you better do it fast . You boys make up your mind how to get us outta here yet ? They 're talking about flying in a DSRV from Norfolk . - I just wish I could 've seen it . - OK . How long 's that gonna take ? Hey ... - Hey ... hey it 's Bud ! - That 's impossible . - Do you read me Deepcore ? - No it 's not . Yes ! W-W-Wait . Wait . Wait . We 've got a message from Bud . - Bud ? - What 's it say ? Here . Here . It says ... It says , uh , " Virgil Brigman back on the air . " " Have some new friends down here . " " Guess they 've been here a while . " " They 've left us alone , but it bothers them to see us hurting each other . " " Getting out of hand . " " They sent a message . Hope you got it . " I 'd say that 's a big 10-4 , Jack . " They want us to grow up a bit and , put away childish things . " " Of course , it 's just a suggestion . " Looks like you boys might be out of business . What the hell 's goin ' on ? One Night , get to sonar . Good God almighty ! Fellas ... I 'm gettin ' some awful big readings here . - Somebody 's comin ' up the wall ! - What is it ? Whatever it is , it 's major ! Something is definitely going on down there . - Active is pinging back something really big . It 's huge and it 's comin ' up right underneath us . - Where ? Where ! ? It 's everywhere ! There ! Starboard bow ! There ! Look ! Look ! Help , Cat ! We should be dead . We didn 't decompress . They must have done something to us . Oh , yeah . Yeah , I think you could say that . Hi , Brigman . Hi , Mrs. Brigman .

 Captain 's log , star date 41255.6 . After delivering Earth colonists to the Strnab solar system , we have discovered another Class-M planet in the Rubicun star system . We are now in orbit there . It is inhabited and unusually lovely . An away team has gone down to make contact . They are returning to the ship . Riker says the planet 's life forms are almost identical to us . - He 's enthusiastic . - Captain ? Sorry , Troi . The Doctor has something important to tell you . You 've talked about it for days . Shore leave for the crew . Establishing this colony has been exhausting for the crew . We 're not a supply vessel . Settling all those people has been a strain . I 'm tired myself . Is it as good as your report suggests ? As per report . Class-M , Earth-like , beautiful . It will startle you . Sounds wonderful for the children . The holodecks are marvellous , but there 's nothing like open spaces and fresh air . I 've listed my report on their customs and laws . Simple , common-sense things . They 're wild , but also puritanical . They 're neat as pins , ultra lawful , and make love at the drop of a hat . Any hat . But the happiest report has its negatives . Let 's have them . There are none that we could find . - But there is a problem here . - That faulty reading , sir . I 'm reading something off the starboard bow , but there is nothing there . Sensor technicians are working on it , sir . A glitch in the system . I take it you find no glitch at all in this planet , however ? No , sir . If you approve shore leave , we could start with a small group . Of course . Wesley ? If we go down , I 'd like you to join the away team to evaluate this planet as a place for young people to relax . Yes , sir . If our scans and observations confirm the report , of course I 'll approve it . Let 's just hope it 's not too good to be true . Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission , to explore strange new worlds , ... .. to seek out new life and new civilizations , ... .. to boldly go where no one has gone before . Captain 's log , supplemental . We are in orbit of Rubicun Ill , the home of a life form who call themselves the Edo . Our away team , including Wesley Crusher , has beamed down to make arrangements concerning some well-earned recreation . - Careful , sir . - It 's alright . Those are the Edo we met before . - They certainly are fit . - They certainly are . - Health and happiness . - A pleasant day to you . You did return , as promised . Rivan , Liator . Also from our vessel , Troi and ... Slowly , slowly . I must welcome this lovely one . Nice to see you again . My pleasure . Counsellor ? Healthy sensuality , sir . I feel friendship and ... happiness . And I welcome this huge one . Oh , yes ... Nice planet . Yeah . But you are a young one . I do not know your love customs . I guess ... .. whatever you usually do . Others would like to visit . Is there a limit on numbers ? Whatever pleases you . We 'll discuss it at the Council Chambers . Shall we go there now , or remain in play ? - Play ? - At love . Unless you don 't enjoy that . Perhaps you do . And you ... - Yes , I can see that you do . - Maybe I should just go on ahead . This is unfair to him . We 'll go to the Council Chambers . - There are people your age there . - Well , I can 't make any promises . You don 't have to . Our rules are simple . No one does anything uncomfortable to them . Come ! Our people will want to know you . Rivan , perhaps they can 't run . Can 't run ? Of course we can run . Right , Commander ? That 's the custom here , running . Lead the way . - When in Rome ... - When in where , sir ? - Good health to you . - Happiness to you . It 's like an Eden here . Good health . I thought you 'd be out of breath . - We may surprise you . - Children , meet your new friend . - Well , hello ! Join us . - Yes , please . - Come on . - This way . And now you must meet some new friends . Everyone ! We 've brought the visitors . Please . Enjoy what we have . I 've traced it through our sensor channel , sir . It is not a glitch . It 's confirmed by my readings . It 's a ... shadow something . Exactly . As if it were neither in or out of our dimension . - What is , Commander ? - Whatever is evading our alarm , sir . Centre main viewer on that area . I see nothing , Commander . Enterprise to object off our starboard bow . Identify yourself . Shields and deflectors up full , sir . Main phaser banks ready . Any reply ? It was unintelligible . Running it through language circuits . - Geordi , have a real look . - Aye , sir . Sir , my sensors read it . It 's half there . It looks as if it were partly transparent . Data , what the hell is it ? - Lt. La Forge to Captain . - Go ahead . What can you make out ? I 've never seen this before , sir . After a spectral analysis , it 's ... as if it 's not really there . I don 't understand it . I 've got its first transmission , sir . It translates as ... .. " stand by " . Sir , something 's coming out of that ship . Verified , sir . It 's very small . What is it ? ! Intruder alert , sir . No location . The away team ! We 've lost contact with our people . - The relays do show something . - Why is everything a " something " ? State ... the ... purpose . State the purpose of what you have done . I 'm Capt Picard ... commanding this Federation starship . State the purpose of your visit here . We have sent down our away team to make peaceful contact here . Do you plan to leave life forms here ? No . We are merely visiting here . But you did more at the world you just left . Why have you left your own life forms there ? The colony we just planted , sir . That world was uninhabited . The life forms we left there had ... had sought the challenge ... At least , that is the basic reason . .. had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle , a new society there . Life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself as widely as possible . Do not interfere with my children below . Captain , I do not understand how , but it is asking me if I was constructed for information exchange . If there is any way of finding out whatever it is out there , Data ... Watch . I bet you can 't do this . Watch this . I want to do something , too . With you . - What ? - It 's something you can teach me . - Will you ? - Well ... Actually , there are some games I don 't quite know yet . It 's playing ball . Will you teach me ? Sure ! If you have a bat , I can show you my favourite . A bat ? A stick or a branch . Erm ... about this long , this thick . In the gardens . Come on . - This will please you . Join us . - Thanks . Another time . - Joy and happiness . - It certainly is . - The good life , Worf . - I am not concerned with pleasure . - I am a warrior . - Even Klingons need love . For love , sir , I would need a Klingon woman . What about plain old basic sex ? No need for that ? Of course . But with the females available to me , Earth females , I must restrain myself too much . They are quite fragile , sir . Worf , if anyone else said that , I 'd suspect he was bragging . - Bragging , sir ? - I 'll pass on that . I 'd better check in . Enterprise , come in . Captain , do you read me ? Let 's ... This may be nothing , but let 's move our people together . Including Wesley , the boy ? He 's outside . - Is there a problem ? - We 've lost contact with our ship . It 's nothing these people have done . I 'm certain . Their minds are open . Help me locate Wes . He 's wandered off . That is extraordinary . - One moment , Lieutenant ? - Yes , but you 've got to hear this . You 're saying there 's no crime here ? No one breaks any laws ? Once , long , long ago , there was much disorder . But not now . But I see no sign of police . - Those who enforce laws ? - We have very few . Mediators . They are needed only in one place each day . The punishment zone . A selected area . A completely random selection ? Only our mediators know where or for how long . We 're proud of the wisdom of our ancestors . No one knows where or when a zone will be . - And so no one risks death . - Death ? By breaking any law . - Explain this . - Only one punishment for any crime . Anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies ? The law is the law . Our peace is built on that . Even for ignoring a rule like " keep off the grass " ? Then no one breaks that rule . Who would risk execution ? A white wall or fence reminds anyone of a forbidden area . And just who tells visitors about these rules ? We 'd better find Wesley . Here ! Alright ! Over here ! Yeah , go back . Alright ! You 're very clever at this . At home , we play a lot . Toss the ball ahead of me . - No ! - It 's forbidden to disturb plants . Couldn 't you see the fence ? Don 't ever go past a white marker ! It 's OK . - I 'm fine . - No ! Please , no ! - Speak the truth . We are mediators . - I said I was fine . - He doesn 't know . - How very sad . - This zone has been selected . - But he doesn 't understand . It 's always sad . Now , doubly so . I was chasing a ball and I fell into that . I 'm really sorry . - You admit you did that , freely ? - I 'm with Starfleet . We don 't lie . It won 't happen again . We apologize . We 're sorry , too . But that changes nothing . Careful , they 've got some strange laws here . - You reviewed their laws . - There was nothing about punishment . One moment . Is there a witness to this transgression ? It was my fault . I threw the ball past him . We have a visible transgression , witnesses and an admission of guilt . Though it pains us deeply to do it , we must . - Are you prepared for punishment ? - Punishment ? If you mean what they told us about ... - What punishment ? - Death . Don 't make it difficult . Drop it ! Drop it now . It 's a kind of syringe . What is this ? Is this poison ? Of course . Completely painless . The boy would have felt nothing . - Now you 've frightened him . - He was going to kill me ? And if this zone was still in effect , you would all die . They said you came as friends . Is this how friends act ? Enterprise , from away team . Come in . Are you receiving us , Enterprise ? - Condition ? - No sign of consciousness . But the readings are normal for him . This must be some form of information exchange with whatever is out there . - I hope it is . - Any news from the away team ? Something 's blocking communication . Security . Urgent ! Enterprise from away team . - Lieutenant , we 're receiving you . - Urgent call for Capt Picard . We have serious trouble with ... a member of the team and an unusual law they have here . Riker , stand by . Any signs of consciousness ? No . It may be minutes or hours . It 's unclear what 's happened to him . Take him to sickbay . Anything new on that thing over there ? Negative , sir . Captain to First Officer . I 'm beaming down . Would you care to comment privately on how you read any of this ? Unnecessary . These people are honest , almost to a fault . And they have great pride in their ways . You 're the Captain . We 're ready . This way , please . - Welcome to our world , Captain . - Thank you . We regret that our system of justice is troubling you . The boy , Wesley Crusher , where is he , please ? I 've allowed them to hold him pending the outcome of this . He is safe and unharmed . We promise that . Captain , I do not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice , even if you respect such things . - We do . - Good . So do we . Our precepts have been handed down from long ago . The tranquillity you see has been made possible by our laws . We are a people of law . They sometimes bring us sadness , but we have adjusted to that . Perhaps your laws work as well . They haven 't always . Now , they do . - Do you execute criminals ? - No . Not any longer . - But you did once . - Unfortunately . But since then ... But when you did , was it believed necessary to do so ? Some people felt so . Now , we detect the seeds of criminal behaviour . Capital punishment is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent . So , we are not yet as advanced as they are . And since you are advanced in other ways , I suggest you use your superior powers to rescue the Wesley boy . We will record him as a convicted criminal , an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world . Unfortunately , we have a law known as the Prime Directive . Riker has explained it . Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment ? Until sundown ? Because you are strangers , we are delaying enforcement of the law , but we must act by sundown . Then I have another question . While orbiting , while circling high above your world , as we do , we have encountered a strange object . A vessel , perhaps . Have you any idea what it is ? It 's not entirely real . At least , it 's not ... completely solid . - Do you mean God ? - God ? God is said to be somewhere up there , protecting us . Exactly ... how would you describe God ? As you just did . As existing both here , and in another place also . But when God wants to show its power , it can make itself felt most fully . Captain , come in , please . - Picard here . - CMO Crusher , sir . Cmdr Data has regained consciousness . - What condition ? Can he talk ? - He insists on it , sir . Urgently . Stand by . Picard out . I want to speak to her personally about her son . You promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown ? You have our word . Then , will one of you return with me to our ship ? Of course . I 'll go as a hostage for the boy 's safety . No . I want you to identify something for me , if you can . Transporter room , three to beam up . - I 'm frightened . - There 's no reason to be . Transporter room , energize . But this is a city . A great city . - Captain , what 's this about Wesley ? - In a moment , Doctor . - In a moment ? - Exactly ! In a moment . You were about to say ? With such power , why be concerned about our laws ? You could take the boy from us . It 's not that simple . From the starboard lounge , you can see whatever is outside this vessel . You mean my world ? We 're high above it . And something else circling your world . It 's important to us , and perhaps to you , to know what it is . I 'm sorry , but it was necessary . Do you know what that is ? - Can you tell us what it is ? - Is it God ? It 's very important that you answer something . How do you recognize what it is ? Nothing will harm you . I promise . Just tell us how you recognize it . It has appeared before . Can you speak to it ? Does it speak to you ? Captain ! Return my child . - Return ? - It 's coming towards us . Picard to transporter room , come in . - Yes , but hurry ! - It 's still coming towards us . Transporter Chief to Captain . One to beam down to away team location . Hurry ! Engage ! Urgent ! Engage ! It seems the Edo 's god is very protective of its children . I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her . I 'm sorry I had to . She was so frightened . It 's understandable . Orbiting with God is no small experience . Let 's go see your patient , Doctor . What do you intend to do about my son ? He 's being held safely until sundown . When he faces execution ! He 's committed no crime any sane and reasonable person ... You saw what that thing was about to do . I apologize , sir . But this is very difficult for me . If he were your son you 'd be as frightened ... But I am . Data 's in sickbay here . You 'll find him able to talk to you . - He 's checking out fine . - Thank you . Finish it later , please . I was an excellent choice . They were able to communicate quite ... I was about to say easily , but there was nothing easy about it . They were about to overload my circuitry . You say " they " . So it is a vessel of some sort ? It 's not a single entity , sir . They know the Edo worship them as a god . They know ? They recognize it is expected at the Edo stage of evolution . What sort of vessel ? It 's perhaps not what we would call a vessel , sir . The dimensions it occupies allow them to be ... in several places at once . They consider this entire star cluster is theirs . It was probably unwise of us to place a human colony in this area . Of course , there are 3,004 other planets we could colonize . - The largest ... - Data , don 't babble . Babble , sir ? I 'm not aware that I ever babble , sir . I sometimes have considerable information to communicate , and you may question the way I organize it ... Please , organize it into brief answers to my questions . We have little time . Do they accept our presence at this planet ? Undecided , sir . Data , please , feel free to volunteer any important information . I volunteer that they are now observing us , sir . - To judge what we are like ? - No . It is more curiosity . I doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems . - Do they know our Prime Directive ? - They know everything I know , sir . And ... if we were to violate the Prime Directive ... ? - That 's not a fair question . - How would they react ? They would judge us by our own rules , sir . If we violate our own Prime Directive , they might consider us to be deceitful and untrustworthy . They did caution us not to interfere with their children below . - What has happened ? - The Edo want to execute my son . - I will not allow that to happen . - Most interesting , sir . The emotion of motherhood as compared to others ... Shut up ! You were right , sir . I do tend to babble . Captain 's log , star date 41255.9 . Whatever the object in orbit with us , it hangs there like a Nemesis . It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious , but quite another to be silently observed by it . I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason we do . You sent for me , sir ? Let 's have more talk , Data . Yes , sir . Sit down . What level of communication , sir ? Any . My apologies for saying that you babbled . But I do , sir . You also see things as we do not , but as they truly are . I need help , my friend . I cannot permit that boy or anyone from this vessel to be sacrificed . The Prime Directive never intended that . The problem is there . They 've learned of the Prime Directive from my mind , but how will they evaluate it ? How do they reason ? What are their values ? - Remember their warning to us . - Exactly ! How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws ? Not permitting the Crusher boy ... .. to be executed . And by so doing do I endanger this vessel and a thousand other lives ? Would you choose one life over one thousand , sir ? I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that . Did you learn of the relationship between that and the Edo ? Why are they so certain it 's a god ? Any sufficiently advanced life form appears as that to others , sir . But when they were probing my thoughts , I could feel that they once existed in this dimension , just as we do . Perhaps in the same flesh-and-blood form . Since then , however , they have evolved considerably . Their present existence no doubt has advantages we do not understand . In some earlier flesh-and-blood form they might have shared our values ? We know the Edo share them . Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the Edo ? Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison . Possibly a race which those life forms have planted here . Much as we now plant human colonies on Class-M planets . Having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding Cmdr Data ... You now request permission to beam down to the planet . Granted . You can accompany me while I try and resolve this . Know that whatever the cost , I will not allow them to execute your son . Thank you , sir . - Data , take command . - Aye , sir . It 's almost time . I want the boy brought here now . - I 'll go with you . - Of course . Captain Picard . I saw you share the sky with God . You must be gods . No , we are not gods . Mother . I guess you know a lot has happened here . I know . Captain Picard , ... .. are you going to let them kill me ? No . But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand . How can we let this happen , Liator ? They threaten everything we respect . Our law , our peace , our tranquillity and order . You are powerful . But do not do this to us , we beg you ! At least study what we were without law . Hurtful , savage , thieving . I understand . Perhaps your system of law is better than any system we once had . But we do now have a law I must obey . Part of it says I must protect my people from harm . We did not ask you to come here . It has to do with another law that we must obey . We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the galaxy . If I save this boy , I break that law . And should be executed if you do . I may suffer almost as much . Starfleet takes the Prime Directive seriously . No , it is God who will punish you . That has crossed our minds . Your god up there may insist that we obey our non-interference directive . Sir , does this mean if you save me then the entire crew could die ? You 're not involved in this decision , boy . I 'm sorry , sir , but it seems like I am . Picard to transporter room , stand by for six to beam up . Wesley ... Lieutenant ... Our laws have been violated . What of justice ? What of justice to Wesley ? Does he deserve to die ? I 'm truly sorry , but I must have justice for my people too . Transporter room , energize . - Transporter room , come in ! - We can 't energize the beam , sir . God has prevented your escape . Then God is unfair . My son had no warning of your laws . We cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defence . I don 't know how to communicate this , or even if it 's possible . The question of justice has concerned me greatly of late . I say to any creature listening , there can be no justice so long as laws are absolute . Even life itself is an exercise in exceptions . When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book ? Seems the Edo lord agrees with you , Number One . Main viewer on . - Hailing frequencies . - Open , sir . To the object in orbit with us . We will remove the human colonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so . Please tell us . Captain ... - Is that a signal ? - I suppose ... I suppose it must be . I was hoping for more . More of what , sir ? I 'm glad it 's gone . Agreed , sir . Short and sweet . God-like efficiency . I was hoping we might learn more about it . But since we can 't , take us out of here , Number One . Gladly , sir .

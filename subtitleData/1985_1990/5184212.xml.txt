I want to talk to you about ducts . Do your ducts seem old-fashioned , out-of-date ? Central Services 's new duct designs ... are now available in hundreds of different colors ... to suit your individual taste . Hurry now , while stocks last , to your nearest Central Services showroom . Designer colors to suit your demanding taste . [ Man ] Tonight we have with us , from the Ministry of Information ... Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann . [ Helpmann ] Good evening , David . What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ? Bad sportsmanship . A ruthless minority of people ... seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues . They just can 't stand seeing the other fella win . If these people would just play the game ... they 'd get a lot more out of life . Nevertheless , Mr. Helpmann , there are those who maintain ... that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy . [ Helpmann ] David , in a free society , information 's the name of the game . You can 't win the game if you 're a man short . [ David ] And the cost of it all , Deputy Minister . Seven percent of the gross national product . [ Helpmann ] I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayer . People want value for money . That 's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges . - [ Fly Buzzing ] - It 's absolutely right and fair ... that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention ... and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation . Do you believe that the government is winning the battle against terrorists ? Oh , yes . Our morale is much higher than theirs . We 're fielding all their strokes , running a lot of them out ... and pretty consistently knocking them for six . I 'd say they 're nearly out of the game . [ Buzzer Buzzing ] [ Buzzer Buzzes ] [ Helpmann ] ... law-abiding citizens to have to subsidize criminals ? But , Mr. Helpmann , the bombing campaign is now in its 13th year . Beginner 's luck . [ Chuckles ] Thank you very much , Deputy Minister . Thank you , David . And a very merry Christmas to you all . [ Woman ] " Scrooge was better than his word . " He did it all , and infinitely more . - [ Imitating Machine Gun Fire ] - " A nd to Tiny Tim , who did not die ... " he became a second father . " He became as good a friend in the good old world .

Don 't take any notice of them , love . Don 't touch me . Why don 't you just get the hell out of here . Don 't you worry , love . We 'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy . - That 's it . Nothing to worry about . - Right . It 's Tuttle downstairs who can worry , eh ? Tuttle ? His name 's Buttle . There must be some mistake . Mistake ? [ Chuckles ] We don 't make mistakes . - [ Crash ] - That 's bloody typical . They 've gone back to metric without telling us . Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? Yeah .

I don 't expect to see you slumming it in Records . - What 's the problem ? - Problem ? No problem . Everything 's fine . Wonderful . Marvelous . Alison 's in great shape . Kids are fine . I 'm on Security Level 5 now , so Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more . - It 's been a great year . - You sound worried . Worried ? Me ? If I 'm worried about anyone , Sam , it 's you . I mean , look at you , Sam . Whatever happened to you ? Records ? Sam , you were one of the brightest - Sam ? Uh , Jack , it 's great to see you . - I 'm gonna be late . - Sam .

I want to report a wrongful arrest . You want Information Adjustments . Different department . I 've been to Information Adjustments . They sent me here . They said you have a form I need to fill out . Have you got an arrest receipt ? Yeah . - Is it stamped ? - Stamped ? No , no . There 's no stamp on it , you see . I can 't let you have the form until this is stamped . - Where do I get it stamped ? - Information Adjustments . [ Clears Throat ] It 's nothing . It 's nothing . It keeps picking up old films . That can 't be right , can it ? Perhaps the machine 's on the blink . No , it 's not the machine . There 's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers . Tuttle should have had £ 31.06 debited against his account , not Buttle . - My God ! A mistake ! - Well , at least it 's not ours . Isn 't it ? Whose is it ? - Information Retrieval . - Oh , good . Yeah . See , Expediting has put in for electrical procedures ... in respect of Buttle , Archibald , shoe repair operative ... but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle , Archibald , heating engineer . Oh , what a relief . Finish your tea , Sam . What ? Oh . Thanks . I don 't know what I would do if you ever got promoted . - Oh , God , don 't worry about that . - No , but if they did promote you , uh - I 've told you before . I 'd turn it down . - Would you ? Really ? - Really . You 've been promoted . It 's your mother , isn 't it ? Pulling strings again . Sam , it 's time for you to grow up and accept responsibility . Your poor father would be appalled at your lack of promotion . Ooh ! Mother , I just wish you would stop interfering . I don 't want promotion . I 'm happy where I am . No , you 're not . Jack Lint is a lesson to you . He doesn 't have your brains , but he 's got the ambition . You haven 't got the ambition . Luckily , you 've got me and the deputy minister . - Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father . - Now , please , Mrs. Lowry . Don 't get upset . Mr. Lowry , please wait in reception . You 're giving her wrinkles . - You see ? - [ Sam ] God ! Just try and relax , Mrs. Lowry . I 'll make you 20 years younger . - Ha ! - Yoo-hoo , Dr. Jaffe . You are a genius . Would you like to be surgeon general ? I know simply everybody . Well , they won 't know you when I 've finished with you . - Mmm .

Now , I lift ... the wrinkles and the worry lines ... right up into the wig , into the hairline . [ Sighs ] [ Jaffe ] Now the template . - Mercy . - There . Now a bit of sticky . Like so . And already she 's twice as beautiful as she was before . Voilà ! Mr. Helpmann was very close to your poor father . He was very close to me . Still is .

It 's also accepted for gynecological examinations ... - including cesarean section . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Spiro . - I 'm sorry , madame . I don 't know what to say . It never really happens to us . I 'm going to do something about it straightaway . Really , Sam ! Why can 't you do something about these terrorists ? - It 's my lunch hour . - [ Male Voice On Speaker , Distorted ] Besides , it 's not my department . Actually , Alma , that was one of the little things I 've been dying to tell you . Look . Sam 's been promoted to Information Retrieval . Oh , that 's wonderful ! Congratulations , Sam ! Stop it !

Heating engineer at your service . Tuttle ? Are you from Central Services ? [ Scoffs ] I called Central Services . Well , they 're a little overworked these days . Luckily I intercepted your call . You did - Just a minute . What was that business with the gun ? It 's just a precaution , sir . Just a precaution . I 've had traps set for me before now . And there are plenty of people in Central Services ... who 'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle . [ Laughs ] Are you telling me that this is illegal ? Well , yes and no . Officially , only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff . - Would you hold this , please ? - Uh - But nowadays , with all the new rules and regulations ... they can 't get decent staff anymore . So they tend to turn a blind eye as long as I 'm careful . Mind you , if ever they could prove that I 've been working on their equipment ... well , that 's a pipe of a different color . [ Chuckles ] - Wouldn 't it be simpler just to work - - Would you hold this for me ? Sorry . Yes . I was saying , wouldn 't it be simpler to work with Central Services ? Nah ! Nah . Couldn 't stand the pa [ Low Rumble ] - We 're getting warm . - You couldn 't what ? Couldn 't stand the what ? - Paperwork . Couldn 't stand the paperwork . Listen . This whole system of yours could be on fire ... and I couldn 't even turn on a kitchen tap without filling out a 27 B / 6 . Bloody paperwork . [ Scoffs ] I suppose one has to expect a certain amount . Why ? I came into this game for the action , the excitement . Go anywhere , travel light , get in , get out , wherever there 's trouble , a man alone . Now they got the whole country sectioned off . You can 't make a move without a form .

He 's been overcharged for Information Retrieval procedures ... and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can . Can I have a look ? I 've never seen a refund check before . I 'll bet it 's Jeffries . Yes . He always believes that people should pay more for their interrogation . And " B , " he loathes me . We 've gotta get rid of it ! Well , send it to somebody else . Better still , send it to Buttle . After all , it 's his check . I 've tried that . But look . Look at this . You see ? The population census has gotten him down as " dormanted .

I don 't care how you behaved when you were at Records . Information Retrieval is an executive branch . We 're proud of our reputation and we protect it . Damn it , Lowry ! That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for ! I thought I told you to deal with it . And what the hell is this mess ? An empty desk is an efficient desk . Good God . Queries from Security . Searches from Central Banking about a check ? Clarification notices from Accounting concerning unreturned receipts ? - Mr. Warrenn , I have to find out about - - Get up !

I 'm afraid this case has become much more complicated since last we ... talked . But she 's innocent , Jack . She 's done nothing wrong . Tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon . - [ Groans ] - She 's not alone in all this . We 've just had a report in that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat ... and sabotaged adjacent Central Services . As a matter of fact , it looks like on your block . I should keep my eyes open if I were you , Sam . Bye . But , Jack , you don 't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league , do you ? I do . Everything 's connected all along the line . Cause and effect . That 's the beauty of it . Our job is to trace the connections and , uh , reveal them . This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside . Bye-bye . Oh , but , Jack ! She 's innocent , Jack . Sam , we 've always been close , haven 't we ? Yes , Jack ? Well , until this all blows over just stay away from me .

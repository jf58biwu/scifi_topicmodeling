 Bio-readouts are in the green . Looks like she 's alive . There goes our salvage . - How are we today ? - Terrible . at least . - Where am I ? been here two days . but now you 're OK . Looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy . Come here . Come here . you stupid cat ? Where have you been ? I guess you two have met . I 'm Carter Burke . I work for the company . But don 't let that fool you . I 'm an OK guy . I 'm glad you 're a little better . The weakness and disorientation should pass soon . It 's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? Has no one discussed this with you yet ? I don 't recognize this place . I know . It 's just that this might be a shock . It 's longer ... How long ? Please . 57 years . - What ? - You were out there for 57 years . and it 's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you . kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . Are you OK ? Are you OK ? God ! Nurse ! Someone get in here now . Now ! - Hold . - Please ... Hold her . Kill me ! Bad dreams again ? Want something to help you sleep ? I 've slept enough . Come here . It 's all right . It 's over . - Sorry I 'm late . - ls there any word about my daughter ? cos we don 't have long . and it 's great . Stick to that and we 'll be fine . There 'll be a lot of heavyweights there - insurance guys ... Do you have any news about my daughter ? We did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest ... I guess - aged 66 . And that was at the time of her death . Which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy ... Wisconsin . No children . I checked . I promised her that I 'd be home for her birthday . Her 11th birthday . I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story ? please . Please . a rather expensive piece of hardware . of course . an unsurveyed planet at that time . - for reasons unknown . - Not for reasons unknown . I told you . which destroyed my crew . And your expensive ship . found no evidence of this creature . Good . That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn airlock . Like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did lqs drop sharply while I was away ? an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We horned in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds . A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " These are your words . - " And has concentrated acid for blood . " - That 's right . I can see where this is going . But I 'm telling you that those things exist . - Thank you . That will be all . - Please ! the crew member ... said he saw thousands of eggs there . that 's not all . you can kiss all of this bullshit goodbye ! and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . and you are released on your own recognizance to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . I think ... Van Leuwen ? Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? and they never mentioned hostile organisms . - What people ? - Terraformers . Planet engineers . They set up big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a " shake 'n'bake " colony . How many colonists are there ? maybe 7O families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . OK ? - Al ? Remember you sent some wildcatters out into the middle of nowhere last week ? says he 's onto something . - Wants to know if his claim will be honored . - Why wouldn 't it be ? Because you sent them out there on company orders maybe ? Christ ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference . and the answer is always " Don 't ask . So what do I tell this guy ? it is his . - Lydecker ? - What ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be on this level . Get outta here . - You go in places we can 't fit . - That 's why I 'm the best . I 'll tan your hides . - All the kids ... - I don 't care . look at this . we have scored big this time . Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's try and get a closer look at it through that crack down the side . - Shouldn 't we call in ? - Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . That 's about as close as we can get . Shall we take a look inside ? You kids stay inside . We 'll be right back . OK . Bye . they 've been gone a long time . Newt . Dad knows what he 's doing . Mayday ! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control ! Ripley . This is Lieutenant German of the Colonial Marine Corps ... We have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . - Can I finish ? - There 's no way . You wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They pack state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . am I right ? - We 're trained to deal with these situations . Then you don 't need me . I 'm not a soldier . We don 't know what 's going on out there . and that 's all . What 's your interest in this ? Why are you going ? The corporation co-financed that colony with Colonial Administration . building better worlds ... I saw the commercial . I 've gotta get to work . I heard you 're working in the cargo docks . That 's right . - Running forklifts ? - So ? Nothing . It 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The company 's agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . kiddo . get back on the horse ... Spare me . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . I know . I read it . You wake up every night soaking with sweat ... and I mean it . and I would be no good to you if I did . OK . Would you do me a favor ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . Hello ? - You OK ? - Just tell me one thing . right ? but to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . I 'm in . you 're staying here . man . Drake . What ? Is that a joke ? I wish it were . Hicks . You lookjust like I feel . what are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the Corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm . every formation a parade . - I love the Corps . - This floor is freezing . sir ? people . Let 's go . on your feet . You just had three weeks on your back . not this frozen shit . how about it ? people . Shag it . Who 's Snow White ? She 's some kind of consultant . Apparently she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fucking-do . I 'm impressed . have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? You 're just too bad . what 's the op ? - It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity . Dumb-ass colonists . I think . boy . Eat it . I sure wouldn 't mind gettin ' some more Arcturian poontang . Remember ? but your one was male . - Doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian . please . Come on . - All right ! - I don 't wanna see that . Drake . Bishop ! man ! you . - Quit messin ' around . Trust me . knock it off . - Thank you . - Enjoy your meal . - That wasn 't funny . - Lieutenant German ? Mr Burke ? - Thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . The boy 's got a corncob up his ass . Thought you never missed . You said nothing about an android being on board . Why not ? It never occurred to me . We always have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term " artificial person " myself . - Is there a problem ? - I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't ... the artificial person malfunctioned . and a few deaths were involved . - I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? - The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A / 2 . That explains it . The A / 2s always were a bit twitchy . That can 't happen with our behavioural inhibitors . a human being . Sure you don 't want some ? Just stay away from me . You got that ? Guess she don 't like the corn bread either . atten-ho ! Officer on deck . - As you were . Quickly . Settle down . listen up . Marines . Sorry we didn 't have time to brief you before we left Gateway ... Hicks ? sir . He 's Hicks . or another bug hunt ? and that a xenomorph may be involved . - A what ? - A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . What exactly are we dealing with here ? I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . A crew member was brought back on board some kind of parasite . but couldn 't . Later it seemed to come off by itself and die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner and ... some sort of embryo . He started ... I only need to know one thing : where they are . anywhere . Somebody said " alien " . She thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up . anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Ripley . We have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things wiped out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . there 's no telling how many have been exposed . Do you understand ? so look at it . Any questions ? Private ? - How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? Hudson . All right . Now listen . and by the numbers . I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . weapons strip and dropship prep details will have seven hours . people . You heard the man and you know the drill . Assholes and elbows . come here . I don 't care if you are short . Get it done . I want this loading look sealed . Spunkmeyer ? - Last one . Take it away . Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Hi . I feel like a fifth wheel . ls there anything I can do ? I don 't know . ls there anything you can do ? I can drive that loader . - I have a Class 2 rating . - Be my guest . Where you want it ? please . and there 's nothing to worry about . and we 're gonna kick some . Understood ? sweethearts . on the ready line . Are you lean ? Are you mean ? mean marines ! Hudson ! Get on the ready line . Get some today ! goddammit ! get out ! move it out ! Absolutely badasses ! Let 's pack ' em in . Get in there ! Move it . seven . I want combat seating .

Pre-launch auto cycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . Affirmative . All drop stations secured . 10 seconds .

Nominal to profile . - We 're in the pipe . Five by five . - We 're picking up some hull ionisation . - Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . Lieutenant ? 38 . - Simulated . - How many combat drops ? Two . Including this one . man . Range O14 . Turning on final . - I got a bad feeling about this drop . - You always say that . I got a bad feeling about this drop . I 'll call your folks . All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody online . Lookin ' good . check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . I 'm ready . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . State-of-th e-bad ass-a rt . You do not wanna fuck with me . Check it out . don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam Phalanx . Fry half a city with this puppy . we got sonic electronic ballbreakers ! sharp sticks ... Knock it off . gear up . people . Somebody wake up Hicks . - Coming around for a 709 . - Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? I see it . - That 's the atmosphere processor ? - That 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . by the way . take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . Hold at 40 . Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . set down on the landing grid . then stay on station . Down and clear . people . Look sharp . I want a nice clean dispersal this time . Let 's go . Move it out . Head ' em up . get yours in a cordon . Watch the rear . take point . Let 's move . Move up . run a bypass . move up . Flanking positions . Second squad online . Are you set ? Go on . take the upper level . are you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . We got some explosives damage . It 's probably seismic survey charges . people . use your motion trackers . Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . you 're up . It 's right in there . Now . we have a negative situation here . sir . Wait . Tell him to ... Back up . Pan right . There . You seeing ' this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . you 're gonna love this . what 's your status ? We 've just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . this place is dead . I think we missed it . The area 's secured . Let 's see what their computer can tell us . - It 's not secured . - The area is secured . head for Operations . try and get their CPU online . Affirmative . meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . - He 's 00min ' in . I feel safer already . - Pendejo jerk-off . we got the CPU online . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . let 's go . Are you all right ? they sealed off this wing at both ends . and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . sir . - Last stand . - Must have been a hell of a fight . Looks that way . this way . We should be able to cut through the medlab to Operations . Lieutenant . Are those the same ones ? Careful . Looks like love at first sight to me . He likes you . the rest are dead . Surgically removed before embryo implantation . John J. Died during the procedure . They killed him taking it off . I think we got something here . - Behind us . - One of us ? where are your people ? Anybody in D-Block ? Negative . We 're all in Operations . Frosty . baby . - It 's moving . - Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . - Fuck . - Hold up . It 's all right . Come on . Corporal . - Don 't be afraid . We won 't hurt you . It 's all right . Come on out . Come on . Easy ... I got her . Damn ! - Don 't let her go . - She 's under the grille . get your light up here . - Where 'd she go ? - Shine the light . - Down here . - Here . - There she is . Keep back . Don 't scare her . - Grab her . We 're gonna lose her . - Damn it . Wait . It 's OK . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . See ? you don 't . It 's OK . You 're gonna be all right now . easy . It 's gonna be OK . You 're gonna be OK . easy . - What 's her name again ? - Rebecca . Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? why don 't you ? - Total brain lock . - Physically she 's OK . but no permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's hot chocolate . There you go . huh ? I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . too . do you ? - Smoking or non-smoking ? - Just tell me what you 're scanning for . PDTs . Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . zippo . Rebecca . Newt . - What 'd you say ? - My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this ? Casey . - What about your brother ? What 's his name ? - Timmy . maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and dad ? Look at me . Where are they ? all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . Need anything else ? Bishop . Do you need anything else ? isn 't it ? Stop your grinnin ' and drop your linen . Found ' em . - They alive ? - Unknown . But it looks like all of ' em . under the main cooling towers . Apone . sir . people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Head ' em out . you 're drivin ' . Don 't worry . It 'll be OK . I want a straight V deployment . Second team on left flank . Advance on axial 664 . Tracker online . Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient . little buddy . there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . You want sub-level 3 . watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . - Watch your spacing . - You heard him . Don 't bunch up . Stay loose . Your transmission 's showing a lot of break-up . - Probably interference from the structure . - Use those lights . Next one down . Then proceed on a 216 . Roger . That 's a 216 . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it ? man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies . Easy . Tighten it up . We 're getting a little thin . Nice and easy . - Looks like some sort of secreted resin . - But secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothin ' . huh ? but it 's a dry heat . Knock it off . What do those pulse rifles fire ? 10mm explosive-tip caseless . Standard light-armor-piercing round . Why ? Look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? won 't they rupture the cooling system ? - She 's absolutely right . - So what ? This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? muchachos . Great . Wonderful . Shit . Look ... Apone ? We can 't have any firing in there . I want you to collect magazines from everybody . harsh language ? Flame units only . I want rifles slung . Sergeant . And no grenades . let 's have ' em . Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn . I want it now . Give it up . Vas . you got the duty . Open that bag . cover our ass . people . I like to keep this handy for close encounters . I heard that . - Any movement ? - Nothing . Holy shit . go sit up front . Go on . Now . people . Let 's finish our sweep . and we got a job to do . Keep it movin ' . Easy . Top ! Get over here . We got a live one . - You 're gonna be all right . - Please kill me . Just stay calm . We 'll get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . Dietrich ? Convulsion ! get back ! - Flame-thrower . - Kill it ! Get back . Flame-thrower . Move ! - Movement . - What 's the position ? - I can 't lock in . - Talk to me . Multiple signals . They 're closing . people . Look sharp . - What 's happening ? We can 't see anything . - Pull your team out . I got readings in front and behind . - Where ? I don 't see shit . - He 's right . There 's nothing back here . and it ain 't us . Tracker 's off-scale . They 're all around us . Jesus . Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . Come on ! what is going on ' ? - Wierzbowski and Crowe are down . sound off . Let 's rock ! Who 's firing ? I ordered a hold fire . They 're coming out of the goddamn walls ! I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with ... goddammit . lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads ... Say again ? All after " incinerators " . I said lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back ... Sarge ! Talk to me . Apone ? Apone ! - He 's gone ! now ! - Shut up ! get the hell out ... - Just shut up ! Where 's Apone ? The sarge is gone . Let 's get the fuck outta here ! Marines . look out . - Get it ! - I told them to fall back . - Fall back ! Now ! - I told them to fall back . - They 're cut off . Do something ! Fuck ! Newt . What the hell are you doing ? Turn it round ! That 's an order . damn it . German . Vas . Let 's move it . let 's go . It 's blocked . We 've got to go around . Open the door . we are leaving ! Vas . Run for it . Shit . come on . come on . - Fire in the hold . - He 's gone . - No ! Drake 's out there ! - Put it out . - Drake 's coming . - He 's gone . He 's not ! Forget him . He 's gone . Get on the goddamn door ! Eat this . Go ! we 're clear . You 've blown the transaxle . You 're just grinding metal . ease down . You OK ? Get away from me ! - Lieutenant . - What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know . Maybe a concussion . he 's dead ! pendejo ! Then I 'm gonna kill you ! - Back off . Right now . Somebody get me a first-aid kit . but they ain 't dead . - Then we go back and get them . - Fuck that . I ain 't going back in there . You can 't help them . You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . this ain 't happening ' . man . All right . We 've got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we nerve-gas the whole fuckin ' nest . We don 't know if it 's gonna affect ' em . Let 's just bug out and call it even . Why are we talking about this ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . - Fuckin ' A. - Hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it . They can bill me . this is an emotional moment for all of us . I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments . and I don 't think we have the right to arbitrarily exterminate them . - Wrong . - Yeah . Watch us . Maybe you haven 't kept up on current events . We just got our asses kicked . but I cannot authorize that kind of action . I 'm sorry . I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here . Corporal Hicks is ... ' ? right ? That 's right . this is a multi-million-dollar installation . He can 't make that kind of decision . He 's just a grunt . - No offense . - None taken . do you copy ? - Standing by . - Prep for dustoff . We need immediate evac . - On our way . nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . Hudson . We 'll set him down here . Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . - Hold on . There 's something ... - Just get up here . I 'm in . Ramp closing . Goddammit . Where the f ... ? Run . That 's great . That 's just fuckin ' great . Now what the fuck do we do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now ! Are you finished ? Are you all right ? right ? - I 'm sorry . - You don 't have to be . It wasn 't your fault . man . What the fuck are we gonna do now ? huh ? and they mostly come at night . Mostly . right ? this is everything we can salvage out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 5O rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got 15 of these M-40 grenades . honey . - Is that the only flame-thrower ? - It 's only half-full but it 's functional . Got another one that 's damaged . But the good news ... with display and scanners intact . They really kick ass . They 'll come in handy . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 17 days . but we 're not gonna last 17 hours . Those things are gonna come in here just like before ... This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . Right ? - Why don 't you put her in charge ? - You 'd better deal with it . because we need you and I 'm sick of your bullshit . I want you to get on a terminal and call up a floor-plan file . anything that shows the layout . Are you listening ? every possible way into this complex . - We don 't have much time . - OK . I 'm on it . Just relax . continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . This service tunnel must be how they move back and forth . That 's right . It leads from the processing station right into the sub-level here . come over . Go back ... punch that in right there . No . It 's back here . There 's a pressure door at this end . then seal that door ? but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . here and here . Then they can only come at us from these two quarters . Right . Then we put the other sentry units here and here . Right ? - Right . - Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . let 's move like we got a purpose . - Affirmative . baby . Let 's get the hell outta here . Hudson here . A and B sentries are in place and keyed . Arming now . Hudson . - Fire in the hole ! let 's get the hell outta here . baby . For what it 's worth . I want you to put this on . - What 's it for ? - It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . It 's just a precaution . - Thanks . - It doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . what 's next ? Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . you have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to sleep . I have scary dreams . I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her . She doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry . There . no real ones . aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Did one of those things grow inside her ? I don 't know . That 's the truth . Isn 't that how babies come ? People babies ? - They grow inside you . - That 's very different . I did . I had a little girl . Where is she ? - She 's gone . - You mean dead . Here . Take this . For luck . How 's that ? - Don 't go . Please . - I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera up there ? I can see you through that camera all the time to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you . I mean that . That 's a promise . You promise ? - I cross my heart . - And hope to die . And hope to die . Now go to sleep . And don 't dream . Sneak . completely neutralizing . but it doesn 't get us anywhere . I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists and immobilise them to be hosts for more of these . Which means there would have to be a lot of these parasites . - One for each colonist . Over 100 at least . - That follows . right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . - Maybe it 's like an ant hive . - Bees . Bees have hives . You know what I mean . One female runs the whole show . the mama . man . I mean big . - These things ain 't ants . I know that . I want these specimens destroyed when you 're done . Is that clear ? Mr Burke wants them kept alive for return to the company labs . He was very specific about it . Those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division . and we will be set up for life . do you know that ? You really think you can get a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it . From me . Just like they 'll know you caused the deaths of 157 colonists . - Wait a second ... - You sent them to that ship . Carter J. You sent them out there and didn 't even warn them . Why didn 't you warn them ? What if that ship didn 't even exist ? I didn 't know . and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . and it was wrong . It was a bad call . Bad call ? These people are dead ! Don 't you have any idea what you 've done ? I 'm gonna make sure they nail you to the wall . You 're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . - What 's goin ' on ? - They 're coming . In the tunnel . Here we go . A and B gun tracking and firing . Multiple targets . Look at those ammo counters go . B gun 's down 50 % . it 's a shooting gallery down there . 60 rounds left on B. 40 ... 20 ... 10 . B gun 's dry . 2O on A. 10 ... 5 ... - That 's it . - Jesus . They 're wall-to-wall in there . They 're at the pressure door . - Listen to that . - Bishop here . - I have some bad news . - That 's a switch . but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . man . That beats it all . - How long till it blows ? - Four hours . equal to about 40 megatons . - We got problems . - I don 't fuckin ' believe this . close the shutters . - Why can 't we shut it down from here ? and overload was inevitable . man . And I was gettin ' short . Four more weeks and out . - Now I 'm gonna buy it on this rock . - Give us a break . man . We 've got to get the other dropship from the Su / aco . There must be some way to bring it down on remote . How ' ? The transmitter was on the APC . It 's wasted . but we 'd better think of something . We 're fucked ! We 're doomed ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? I checked . The hard wiring between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Somebody has to go out there . Take a portable terminal and patch in manually . Sure ! With those things runnin ' around ? You can count me out . - I guess we can count you out of everything . - I 'll go . - Why don 't you go ? - I 'll go . - What ? - I 'll go . I 'm the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . Bishop should go . Good idea . but I 'm not stupid . HOW long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly . 180 meters . and about 50 minutes flight time . It 's gonna be close . - Good luck . - See you soon . Watch your fingers . This is unbelievable . 20 meters and closing . - 15 . - How many ? Can 't tell . Lots . D gun 's down 50 % . C gun 's right behind it . It ain 't stopping ' em . 150 rounds on D. baby . - 100 rounds . Come on ! D gun 's down to 20 . 10 . Damn it . Wait . They 're retreating . The guns stopped them . You 're right . - Next time they walk right up and knock . - But they don 't know that . They 're probably looking for other ways to get in . That 'll take ' em a while . - Maybe we got ' em demoralised . - Shut up . I want you two walking perimeter . Move . Listen . We 're all in strung-out shape . But stay frosty and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? 24 hours ? won 't you ? I 'll do us both .

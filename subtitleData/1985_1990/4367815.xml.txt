 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become ... the latest addition to the population of Los Angeles . I wanna be perfectly honest for just one minute . Now this is the truth . Comes from the bottom of my hearts . If I could drive any car off this lot right now ... it 'd be this little baby right here . I thought all these Cocas were junk . Come on , you believe everything you read ? Just take a look at the design . We 're talking state-of-the-art methanol-burning 350-horsepower engine . Factory sound . Air . Anti-lock brakes . Why , the Coca was , and in my opinion , still is ... the car of the future . So why 'd they stop making them in ' 92 ? Why 'd they stopped making the Tucker , the Edsel , the DeLorean ? Nobody was buying them . But were they junk ? No , sir . Look , people ... I wanna make this happen . What can I say ? is the trunk clean ? Lady , you can eat off the rocker panels . Three mutilated bodies in three days has got the Chief snapping his suspenders ... a little bit more than usual . - Who 's in charge of this task force ? - Not you ! - Some guy out of Rampart . - l believe it 's Sergeant Steve Macy . - lt was in the morning watch report . - Yeah , well ... . Anyway , this Macy thinks he needs a Newcomer on his team ... and he 's volunteered you out of my command . Perhaps they felt I 'd be useful , since the victims are Newcomers . Sure , it makes sense . But you 'd think the guy 'd ... show a little professional courtesy and ask me if it was a good idea . He just doesn 't appreciate your mind like we do . That 's enough out of you , Sikes . You 're only on board because your partner is from outer space . No disrespect intended . Matthew , I believe we have a lot of reading to catch up on . Piece of cake . Three dead Newcomers . Hands hacked off above the wrist . Bodies all over town . We follow up on the one in the dumpster in Slagtown . No disrespect intended . emily : I really don 't think you have to wash it . But we always wash vegetables before we serve them , Em . We 're not gonna eat it . - Then why are we carving it ? - Jill said to carve a face in it . It 's a Halloween tradition . Oh , like bopping for apples . Bobbing . Yeah , I guess . Well , now what ? - We gut it . - No ! Yeah ! We cut it open and rip its insides out . Oh , and you gotta carve a real scary face in it ... - to ward off the demons . - Demons . - What is this disgusting tradition ? - lt 's Halloween , Mom . The pagan festival celebrating Samhain , the Celtic ruler of death . On the day of the celebration , the people would light hearth fires ... often sacrificing small animals , or other humans ... to welcome the return of the dead , according to the encyclopedia . And they call themselves civilized . [ Phone ringing ] I 'll get it . - Hello . - Hi ! - Hi , Jill . - Did you ask her ? - l 'm working on it . - You have to come to my Halloween party . - l want to . - Be sure to wear something really neat . It 's a formal party ? Yeah. I 'll be dressing like a pig . If we 're gonna mutilate this vegetable ... we 'd better do it before your father gets back . - l 'll call you back as soon as I can . Bye . - Okay . Now , on all the victims , sorry , like this John Doe Newcomer ... the hands were severed with a single chop . Maybe an axe ... maybe a meat cleaver . Was it an upward or a downward motion ? - Do we care ? - No , actually , that 's a good question . I assume you 're wondering if the victims were in a defensive stance ... in which case the cut would come from the side or the bottom up ... or at rest , in which case we 'd look for a downward motion . - Yes , that is what I was asking . - Defensive . The victims were all alive during the attack , and probably bled to death . - Toxicological tests will tell us more . - And no weapon was found ? No weapons , no motives , no nothing . Any other questions ? Yeah . What happened to the chopped-off hands ? DOCTOR : Good question . Read the report , Sikes . The hands of all the victims are still missing . - Oh , really ? - Page three . Those hands could tell us a lot . I hope you guys don 't mind , but I missed lunch . There were signs of struggle in several of the victims . Fingernail scrapings ... and bio scans ... we 'll throw every trick we 've got at those appendages , if you find them . Glad to give you a hand . All right . Everything is to be coordinated through my office at Rampart . Sikes , Francisco , welcome aboard . You 'll get used to my databases . They 're pretty normal format . Here 's the latest update , including a full psychological profile ... Coroner 's report , and visualization work . - We song-and-dancing the press ? - Like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers . - They were good with the press ? - l 'll rent you the video . [ TV blaring ] Guess what ? I was invited to a Halloween party tomorrow night . You shouldn 't go . Why not ? It 's going to be fun . No one should leave the house until it passes . What passes ? What are you being so weird about ? In time , you 'll learn about Tagdot Cur Hiya . Who ? He rises among his people on the third rotation of the equinox ... when the paraxial sun is in line . Neat . Then what does he do ? He fills the night with screams . MOODRl : There are many stories about Tagdot ... but only one theme prevails . : evilness consumed by madness . His darkness lives in the hearts and minds of all Tenctonese . He was a conqueror with fire in his hands and steel in his heart . He expected adulation , and when our great fathers gave him none ... the night broke with their cries as his armies spread through the cities ... destroying all life in their path . And they were merciless . Hands were severed , and their victims painfully bled to death . Body upon body lined the streets . And he walked among the bodies ... thousands upon thousands of bodies ... and he cried . He cried , not for what he had done ... but because there were no more to destroy . Now is the time for Tagdot to return ... and again walk among his people . - No ! - What do you mean , " no " ? It 's a legend. it 's truth . Sure , it is. lt was a very nice story . You wanna know what he did with the hands ? No . I think you should keep all this to yourself . Let 's not freak out Mom and Dad when I 've got a party to go to . You enter everything we got from the dumpster in the data file . I 'll get coffee . I would like honey and sugar ... and if there are any of those bug pellets left , I 'll have three . Just let them float on the top . You have to let them soften . Don 't stir . I 'll enter the data , you get the coffee . - There you are . - Yeah , here we are . - And here you go . - What 's this ? New addition to the club . You want the honors ? - His both hands are missing . - l can see that . Tape off the area . I 'll call the meat wagon and S.l.D. Here we go . Okay . BURNS : You haven 't got id , no witnesses , no idea why the guy went down there ? No tire tracks , no footprints , no weapon , no hands- - - No reporters . Go away , Burns . - Come on , this is front page , Sikes . - Only in your paper . - So how 'd the guy get down there ? There 's only one set of tracks going in . The victim 's . Nothing coming out- - - Who told you that ? - l got a nose for news . Sounds to me like ... you got a butcher boy who knows how to cover his tracks . - Go away , Burns. I got work to do . - Or it could be a Halloween spook . - You believe in spooks , Sikes ? - Only one . My ex-wife . - Here , can I quote you on that ? - Go away . CORONER : Here we go . - What do we have ? - You tell me , man . CORONER : Let 's get this out of here . Anybody got anything ? - Okay , anybody seen my partner ? - He went that way . - May be something over here . - Put some sand in . - You want me to go with you ? - He 's my partner. I 'll dig him up . - Give me your flashlight . - Not issued down here . - Terrific . - Hey , Sarge ! Don 't get lost . George ? Hey , George . Come out , wherever you are . Okay , George , cut the comedy . We got work to do . George ? Damn ! Damn it , George ! This isn 't a rose garden in here . [ Mice squeaking ] Matthew . I think I found something . George , you almost found a bullet right between your spots . GEORGE : Preliminary report indicates that the perp was driving a late-model pickup . - Wheelbase suggests a Yankee . - Yeah , the Japanese thing . Nice truck . Soil retention tests show that it was red . Okay . Infrared picked up the victim 's blood in the soil ... probably dripped off the weapon . You got anything else ? Let 's see . Perp was wearing a 10-and-a-half shoe ... weighs close to 200 pounds and has an inward toe . - Like a Newcomer inward toe ? - That would be the obvious deduction . You mean , one of you guys is killing you guys ? - Why does that sound so surprising ? - l don 't know . I thought we humans cornered the market on psychotic behavior . Isn 't it encouraging how well we are assimilating into your society ? GEORGE : Hello . Anybody home ? We 're in the kitchen . Sorry I 'm late . We got caught up in a storm tunnel in Little Tencton . is there a reason Emily has her head in a bucket of water ? It 's a new game she heard about today from Jill . Bopping for apples . - Bobbing . - ls she having fun ? Well , she 's been at it for hours . - When does she come up for air ? - When she 's captured an apple . is there a reason she 's doing this ? She wants to go to a Halloween party , George . You know , that pagan festival they celebrate ? is that a problem ? They go out after dark , collecting candies . - Hi . - Hello . Honey , we are not in Little Tencton anymore . I am sure she will be properly supervised and safe . - l know. lt 's just ... . - What ? It 's just that it 's that time of the year . What about the time of the year ? Well , Moodri 's been reminding us of Tagdot . You know , The Night of the Screams ? It 's that time of the year . Tagdot . That old myth . Susan , that is just make-believe . That is a story . Like Craznie and Gleebhi . You don 't believe in Gleebhi ? - Can I go ? - We 're discussing it ! But what are we discussing ? What did Moodri say ? I merely reminded this family of Tagdot 's reign of terror . Moodri . I don 't think you need to terrorize this family with ghost stories ... about a madman who cuts up his own people . Are they just stories , George ? Can you hear me ? Cathy ! Cathy . Okay , I 'm busting down the door if you don 't answer me . And I have a gun if there 's some psycho in there with you . I 'm okay . You always scream when you 're okay ? It was just a bad dream . There 's not some guy behind this door making you say that ? I 'd invite you in , but I 'm a little tired . No , it 's okay . I heard you freaking out and I thought ... . l don 't know. lt 's a crazy neighborhood . I feel better knowing that you 're nearby . Sure . Well , if you have another bad one , I 'm just down the hall . Thank you . Tagdot is what you humans call a boogerman . I don 't know what a boogerman is , George . You mean boogyman ? Oh , yes , that 's it . Well , that 's just hunky-dory , George . All right , here we go . All Takia Yankees in LA with the ' 92 wheelbase run 9,345 . Let 's try red . I re-read the myth last night . It 's deeply rooted in fact . Listen to this . [ Reading in his native language ] " Severed hands were the symbol of Tagdot . " Throughout the ages , on the third equinox ... . " That 's now . " He rose , taking sometimes a few , sometimes thousands . " Pretty spooky stuff , Sikes . That book , it got pictures and everything ? There is an ancient drawing of Tagdot . Sikes , I got an idea . Why don 't you get your partner here to check the mug shots ... to see if he can get a match ? Grow wings and fly away . All right . Red . Yankee . 1992 . 2,394 in LA . Okay , 200-pound owners . " The presentation of severed hands in metal basins ... " became a tradition by Tagdot followers at ceremonial gatherings . " George , count your spots . Didn 't say nothing . I 'm suggesting that if it 's important to find the hands ... that we focus on a metal basin . No , George . We 're gonna cross-reference the databanks ... and find out how many 200-pound Newcomers drive Yankees . If you think it 's a good idea ... I could enter this information into the case jacket for Macy . You don 't wanna talk about this anymore . The press is here . It 's just that I think it could be important . Look , George . Enough of this make-believe land . You 're a cop , not a comic book . This is real . There are seven Newcomers we 're gonna talk to . Shake them down , get some alibis . That 's what cops do . You wanna go ahead and look for ghosts in your own time , be my guest . I got other things to do . What 's going on ? I was merely offering an alternative approach to an investigation . I 'm with you , bro . I think you should get that report on Grazer 's desk just as soon as you can . You mind if I take a look at that ? My brother got this real scary record of , like , people screaming ... and doors creaking open . You really like Halloween , don 't you ? Yeah. lt 's freaky . I think I 'll do very well in the bobbing for apples competition . You 'll be great . What about a costume ? - l think I have got a good idea . - Great . Surprise me . - Gotta be scary , though . - But aren 't you going as a pig ? Yeah , a pig from hell. lt 's sick . Big huge ugly teeth . This nose that 's all screwed up. lt 's gross . - l 'll think of something very scary . - The grosser , the better . Emily , did you hear me ? Yes. I 'll really gross them out . What 's going on ? MATT : Testing , testing . GEORGE : Your translator is broken again . Barely made it through the last interview . What say after the next one we break for lunch ? Sounds like a good idea . I know a nice little restaurant ... - right around the corner . - George , I don 't eat down here . - Too rich for the blood ? - Too alive for the fork . Mr. Paul Revere . This guy couldn 't lift the ax to cut somebody 's hands off . I was just eating my lunch . May I offer you something ? No , don 't . Mr. Revere , we understand you drive a ' 92 Yankee. ls that information correct ? - Yes . - We 'd like to take a look at it if we could . - Run a couple of tests . - l don 't understand . Come on , George . My translator 's spread all over the hallway . Mr. Revere , where were you on the nights of the 27th , 28th , and 29th ? Here. I don 't go out much . - You have somebody to corroborate that ? - l live alone . I don 't have many friends . I have Clot Sto Leakian 's disease . It is a bone disorder brought on by the lack of proper diet on our slave ship . Mr. Revere , what do you do ? Research for the Central Library . - 1-William-152 , come in . - 52 . Go . Detective Macy wants you Code 3 at the morgue . - We got another body ? - He didn 't say . Okay , we 're on our way . Clear . - Should we check his car first ? - Macy said Code 3 . We 'll be back . I 'm not going anywhere . They found them down at the old waste disposal dump . That addendum you put into the databank really paid off , Francisco . Couple of giant metal vats , basins . And neatly displayed right in the middle were these . - Hi . - Cathy . What do you know about a guy named Tagdot ? You okay ? Maybe you better come in . - lf you 're in the middle of something- - - No , please . Come in . There are many legends , stories about Tagdot . Our myths were deeply woven into our culture . Same here , I guess . On the slave ship , the Kleezantsun , Overseers ... they used the stories against us . CATHY : We lived in our bed racks . Thousands of corridors of bed racks ... stacked a hundred stories high , all fanning out like spokes on a wheel ... from a central hub . The Overseers were charged with maintaining order . They pumped gas to keep us submissive . But submission was not easy for some . Since we landed , I 've heard that there was a group ... that acclimated themselves to the gas and tried to organize a revolt on the ship . Hell , yes , you had to have them outnumbered , what , a thousand to one ? Ten times that . CATHY : That 's why they had to strike at our weakest line of defense ... our minds . Already vulnerable from the gas , they twisted our history . Myths became real . Overseers became demons ... more dangerous and powerful than all of us together . Fear became more painful than death . All we had to do to escape the torture was ... lay back and breathe the gas . And that 's what I did . I 'm sorry . I always thought that I was a rational person . You are . So why do these dreams still scare the hell out of me ? Why now ? The Overseers , why the tattoos ? I was told that it neutralized the gas . On the ship , it was a symbol they wore righteously . Now it 's their scar of damnation . He left an hour ago ? Oh , no , I wouldn 't worry . He 's probably around here somewhere . Okay , thanks , Susan . What ? Oh , Happy Halloween to you , too . - You see George ? - Yeah , about an hour ago . Said he was running down to the Coroner 's office to pick up a report . Here 's the report . Where 'd his little legs take him ? Hey , you know what I bet ? Maybe last night he read Snow White ... and decided to pick up seven little midgets for questioning . Sikes , what the hell are you doing ? What 's it look like I 'm doing ? Nothing . Did you see the results of the toxological reports on those hands ? I 'm reading them . Bernine 's a hell of a fast-acting tranquilizer . - Nice little wrinkle to work on . - Yeah . So get on it . - l 'm thinking now , okay ? - Yes , sometimes that happens . - Where 's your partner ? - What do you think he 's thinking about ? Excuse me. I 've got some interviews . I was expecting you . And why is that ? You didn 't look like a man who was affected by myths . My fears are more rooted in reality . Tagdot is real to many . So are Overseers . You found the tattooed hands ... and the myth guided you to the metal basin . And reality led me to you . You drugged your victims first ? Just a dart . Just enough to immobilize them . I preferred to see them bleed to death . I 'm arresting you for the murders of four unidentified Newcomers . Overseers . And I have the names of all the Kleezantsun I exterminated . They were very carefully researched . - You have the right to remain silent . - No one has the right to remain silent ! No one has the right to forget about the atrocities . And no one has the right to take the law into his own hands . Are you our future , George ? Tempered by laws we didn 't write . Forgetful about the hell they created . - l haven 't forgotten . - You have ! You don 't remember your parents that were torn from you . Did you lose one , George ? is there a child they want you to forget ? I haven 't forgotten ! If you do this , there 's no one to take my place . There 's no one to see justice done . And the butchers ' only retribution will be to walk freely among us . The humans can never share the horror ... the Overseers created for us . How can they possibly write laws to exterminate them ? These things must be done among ourselves . I went back to Slagtown alone and finished the interviews . I 'm sorry . I had some business to take care of . I don 't give a rat 's ass if you had a hot hum all set up with the old lady . You don 't just take off when we 've got things to do . - l 'm sorry . - Those hands had tattoos . - That 's got to mean something . - Yes , perhaps . Damn it , George , I could use a little more from you . I 'm only on this task force 'cause you 're from outer space . Yes , I remember . I know who I am . I know what I am and where l came from . Now perhaps we can move past that and focus on the case we are assigned to . I 'm not taking you away from it . Do you have any leads you want me to follow up on ? Yeah , I got a few . Fine . Go ahead . Adam Clayton Powell , 1356 Fourth Street . Drives a ' 92 Yankee . - Said he was ... . - Moocteebuti . Yeah , some kind of prayer thing . Moocteebuti is a spiritual centering for those who have ... - recently been blessed with child . - Yes , the guy was beefing me all the way . Was there a newborn in the apartment ? I don 't know . There was something screaming . He 's not a suspect . What else do you have ? I was there. I was looking at his spots , you weren 't . - l say we lean on him . - Do you have anything else ? Hey , I don 't know what kind of bug crawled up your ass ... but I think you ought to go somewhere and pull it out . Hey , George , what is it ? What is what ? You look a little beat . Maybe you should knock off for the day . You look a little beat . Maybe you should knock off for the day . I will , thank you . Hey , George . Happy Halloween . SUSAN : Oh , George , there you are . GEORGE : What 's the matter ? I called you at the office . You weren 't there . What is it ? Emily , are you all right ? I just wanted to scare people . This is the costume she decided to wear to the Halloween party . You 're hurting her ! How did this happen ? Who let her do this ? I did it. I just wanted to be scary . She doesn 't understand . She only knows the fear you have for them . George ! She doesn 't remember what they were , what they did . Oh , Emily . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I would like to be alone , Moodri . I need to think . You need to talk . Let the thinking out . The weight on your shoulders might grow a little lighter- - l didn 't know there was so much hatred in me for the Kleezantsun . - Their evil gave birth to legends . - Their evil is real . And should never be forgotten . George , they will all disappear in time . That 's not what matters . The Tagdot and his armies are gone and will never return . But the evil vile spirit the Tagdot had within him , is within all of us ... even you and me . What we must do is fight it . With stories ? Myths ? Our myths , our legends , are rooted in truth , young man . They have survived to remind us of who we are , where we have to go ... and the standards we should live by . Okay , keep it going . Johnson , you stay on the staircase . We ready ? Yes . Let 's move . Okay . We missed him . He is out there . It 's his last night . His Night of the Screams . He 's catalogued dozens of Overseers . So what does that mean ? We 'll be picking up a gross of hands tomorrow morning ? He knows his time is running out . He doesn 't need to mislead us with the Tagdot legend anymore . His mission will be one of quick execution . Sounds like a fun night . He is a driven man . An avenger . You got anything , any kind of a hit list ... or something that might tell us where he 's starting ? This could be helpful . Addresses of about 15 Newcomers . Apparently that 's how he spends most of his days . Researching , digging , confirming . And then this little crippled guy goes out and hacks them up ? Don 't underestimate the strength of my people ... especially one with conviction . This document is a record of his actions . If the Overseers aren 't where they are supposed to be ... he moves on quickly to his next rendezvous . Like a cheap nickel-and-dimer . One liquor store looks too hard , he moves to the easier hit . All right . Let 's bring him to our liquor store . Miller , get on the horn . I want you to round up every one of these guys on this list . Every one except these two . Edward G. Robinson of Fifth and Grand ... and John Paul Sartre here in Little Tencton . Okay , we 'll take Sartre . You wanna stick with Robinson ? All right . You 're using them as bait ? You got a problem with that ? If it helps us catch a killer , no . Matthew . I should have arrested Mr. Revere . I intend to include my error in a report to Captain Grazer . Save the paperwork , George . So far , no harm , no foul . Yes , but I 'm sorry . And I owe you an apology . You 're not a machine , George . You got a gut . Sometimes it kicks you into feeling things you 're not sure about . These Overseers , they have a nice life on your spaceship ? They were rewarded well for delivering slaves around the Nouvaxi Boen Range . Yeah , well , this Sartre isn 't exactly living in a palace on this planet . Number three . Should be down here . Do you think we 're too late ? Let 's go . Jean Paul Sartre . is he here ? You want to protect him ? That 's the plan , lady. ls he here ? Why do you want to protect him ? I am a police officer . You were cargo . And your husband is Kleezantsun . I 'm well aware of that . Look , lady , tell us were he is , or id him later at the morgue . He doesn 't need your help . Fine . Let 's get out of here . Matt . Our job requires us to protect your husband . I know what he is . I despise what he did to us on the ship , and forgiveness is impossible . But , if you do not cooperate with us ... I will arrest you for obstructing justice . I will throw you in a hole downtown ... and prosecute you as far as the law will allow me . Now , where is your husband ? I got $ 10 that says we find this guy face-down in a muskrat pie . - 1-William-152 , come in . - 52 . Go . Detective Macy reports Edward Robinson uncooperative ... - and placed in protective custody . - How long ago ? - He pulled into the station at 10 . : 32 . - Twenty minutes . - 52 . Roger . - Matt . A red Yankee . Hasn 't been here very long . 1-William-152 requesting backup at the Palace Theater ... at Grant and Thomas . [ Gun shot ] - That wasn 't from there . - Balcony . - He 's going to kill him ! - Where are they ? Up there . He 's got a gun . Get those people out of here . Turn on the lights . And turn off that damn movie ! [ Gun shot ] Freeze ! Police ! He 's crazy . He 's trying to kill me . We gotta get out of here . Shut up ! Stop right there ! Put the gun down , Paul . You know I can 't do that . If you don 't put the gun down , I will have to fire . He 's Kleezantsun ! Put the gun down ! Are you going to arrest me ? On four counts of murder . - Who 'll complete my work ? - What you 're doing , it 's wrong . Exterminating the exterminators ? It has to be done . Not if it means becoming like them . It 's over ! Put it down . My work cannot be accomplished if I am behind bars . And if I can 't do my work ... what good am I ? No ! Funny little man , wasn 't he ? Yeah , well , I 'll be downstairs , Code 4-ing that backup . It 's all right , Matt . Think they 're complicated , but they 're so simplistic . He was about to blow your face off . You don 't know those people . They were bred to lick our boots . I 'm sorry you have to work with one . I guess I don 't know them . But I know me . Sorry you had to settle for second best . - Hi . - Hi . - How did it go ? - Great . The human children were very impressed with Em 's ability to bob for apples . So she made some friends ? Yes . And she ate three pounds of candy , and she scared herself silly ... and she went to bed with a stomachache . This Halloween is fun ? She said it was the best party she 'd ever been to . What about you ? You look very tired . Yeah , it has been difficult , but it is over . I 'm glad . Not too sure I understand this Halloween ritual . [ Knocking on door ] The humans don 't understand many things about us , yes ... but , in time , they will . Trick or treat !

If you want to know about your killer , I can tell you he 's not a man . Oh , he 's a woman ? He 's a fiend . He 's an animal . Ten people is just a drop in the bucket for the number of people He 's killed over the centuries . Centuries ?

POLICEMAN 2 : It looks like some kind of puncture marks . - Who found him ? - I don 't know . Some guy named Thomas . He 's a cargo worker . Why don 't you take him down to headquarters Where we can question him in private , OK ? OK . So , you were working with Mr. Johnson earlier this evening ? Yeah , I was . I only left him for about five minutes . Did you see anything out of the ordinary ? No , not really . We were just working and joking around Until we moved in that coffin . A coffin ? THOMAS : Yeah , a coffin . John made some pretty sick jokes about it , And he wanted me to open it up . POLICEMAN 1 : Did you ? No , I didn 't . Those things really give me the creeps . Then what do you do ? I left . Where 'd you go ? I went to the bathroom . Man , I had this Italian sausage for lunch , and I ... never mind . Uh-huh . And then what ? THOMAS : Well , when I got back , I found John on the floor . Was anything different ? No . Uh , other than the fact that John was dead , no . Well , the coffin was missing . Missing ? I don 't recall seeing a coffin . No , neither do I. POLICEMAN 2 : Uh , could Mr. Johnson have moved it ? No , not by himself . That thing weighed a ton . Is that all you can tell us ? No . I can 't think of anything else . All right , Mr. Thomas . Thank you for your time . That will be all . I sure hope you guys find who did this . We 'll be in touch . OK . Well ?

The captain will see you right away . JACK TALBOT : Thank you . Jack Talbot . Thanks for taking the time to see me . What can I do for you , Talbot ? I was hoping to get some information On the killing at the airport . Maybe it ties in to ... Talbot . JACK TALBOT : case in Seattle . Talbot . I don 't need some hot shot coming in here And meddling in one of our cases . It just causes all kinds of problems . Look , I 'm not trying to I step on anyone 's toes . I got my best men on this case already . Look , I just lost my partner on this . I just want to catch this guy . OK . Evans and Williams are on the case . You can talk to them . But if you get in their way , you are out of here . Understand ? Thanks for your help . Why are all the guys in their position such assholes ? Why would anyone kill a man and then take a coffin ? Probably so sicko . Yeah , but how did he know a coffin was here ? Unless he works here . Or maybe it 's a passenger that checked it through . Possibly a friend , maybe a relative . Maybe it was Count Dracula . Yeah . Check that out . [ Door opening ] [ Fire blazing ] [ Growling ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Hey ! Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask you what the hell You 're doing back here ? FBI . Can I ask what you 're doing here ? I work here . They told me to keep an eye out for people snooping around , Especially the news people . Were you working the night of the murder ? Yes . Yes , sir . Where did you find the body ? It was right here . Did you clean this place up ? No . They told us not to touch anything . There 's no blood . What 's that ? Nothing . OK . Thanks for your help . You 're are welcome . What 's up , man ? Not much . [ Inaudible ] beer . You need one ? Yeah , you bet . My brother and some of his friends Are going up graveyard night . You want to go ? What 's up there ? Aw , you know , find Nemo 's grave . That one that 's supposed to be haunted . Sure . We used to go up there in high school and look for that . Let 's go up there and scare the shit out Of them little bastards . [ Helicopter chopping ] This is crazy . This guy just burst into flame . There 's not much left . I understand there 's another one inside . All right . Let 's go check it out . [ Coughing ] Oh , gosh . Customer ? I don 't know . Still has his clothes on . Um , Robert , why don 't you ... why don 't you check his pockets . What ? You know , for some ID . Gosh . What was the cremator 's name ? Elliott Maxwell . This is him . Oh , man . You 're not going to believe this . Look at this . Mr. Maxwell 's last patient was Mr. Johnson , The victim from the airport . Dammit . I want that body outside identified . What the hell is going on ? [ Groaning ] For God sakes , you 're going to wake the dead . Be quiet . [ Radio ] WOMAN ( ON RADIO ) : 285 code 6 . 105 North Avenue 52 . Well , that didn 't take long . Don 't even have time to finish this delicious meal . I need to get out of here . There 's something going on at the graveyard . You guys would be interested . [ Sigh ] You said you wanted to get out of here . You know , the graveyard isn 't exactly what I had in mind . So what are you guys doing here ? Just messing around . We didn 't mean no harm . All right . Was there anyone else with you ? Yeah . Randy , Brian , and Tyler . But we can 't find them . Hi , Bob . What 's happening ? I don 't know . We just got here ourselves . Have you searched the graveyard ? We came in on the south side . And we didn 't see anything . BILL : All right . Why don 't you guys keep checking ? Yeah . We still got the three boys missing . And a lot of ground to cover . Yeah , that 's right . Hey , I got a body over here . [ Thunder ] Who the hell are you ? Hey , easy . Slowly . FBI . Sorry . Jack Talbot What are you doing here ? Investigating a murder the airport . I think it ties into a case of mine from Seattle . Didn 't your captain tell you ? Nope . Not a word . Bill , take a look at this . Look at that . Goddammit , just like the marks on the victim at the airport . What do you want us to do with those kids ? Uh , take them down to the station . Get some statements . Hey , I want those other two boys found . We 'll keep searching . Looks like you guys have been busy . And new information ? Yeah . We found the missing boy 's car . It was parked on a side street by the cemetery . We still haven 't found the boys though . I talked to a cargo handler at the airport . Apparently there was no blood found anywhere near the body . Yeah , that 's right . It was all drained out somehow . The boy had marks on his throat , Just like the victim at the airport . So what did the coroner say ? He can 't explain it . The body was supposed to be cremated yesterday . And ? Well , we get a call to the crematorium Yesterday to investigate a man who apparently burst into flame And dies . Guess whose bones we find outside the crematorium . Who ? Tell him Mr. Johnson , the victim from the airport . What the hell were his bones doing outside the crematorium ? Witnesses say that Mr. Johnson came Flying through the front doors and just burst into flames . A dead guy walks out of the crematorium And catches on fire ? We have three witnesses who will swear to it . I don 't believe it . I don 't either . I don 't know what to believe . We examined him at the airport . He was stone dead . Yeah , and we also found the cremator burned Alive inside his own oven . This case is getting weirder by the minute . You know , Jack , we could sure use your help . Tell that to your captain . You 've met our great leader . Well , you just have to get to know him a little better . Then you really hate him . You know , another ... Another strange thing Is our missing coffin . Coffin ? What missing coffin ? Well , one of the cargo workers said That right before Mr. Johnson was killed , They 'd unloaded a coffin . What happened to it ? Don 't know . It 's like it disappeared . Wait a minute . To get rid of something that big , You 'd have to have a truck or a van . Maybe a rental van ? I 'm gonna check on something . I 'll catch up with you guys later . Where are you staying ? The beautiful Airport Inn , room 210 . Hi . I 'm agent Talbot with the FBI . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . What is it ? Do you rent vans or trucks ? We rent vans . Did you rent one a couple of nights ago ? I don 't know . I wasn 't working . Could you check for me ? We 're not allowed to give that information out . Sorry . Oh really ? Well , maybe you 'd like me to get a court order , huh ? Or better yet , I 'll just arrest you for obstruction Of justice in a federal case . How 's that ? All right . Let me look . Thank you . Looks like the only van we rented in the last three days Was to Mr. John Johnson . Mr. Johnson . If that 's it , could you print that out for me ? I guess . Who would have been working that night ? Probably Lisa . And where can I find her ? Try the Hawaiian islands . How 's that ? She 's on vacation . Left this morning . When 's she coming back ? One week . Great .

Jack , here 's the preliminary autopsy Report on the boy we found in the graveyard ... same MO . Two puncture wounds of the throat , Completely drained of blood . Every bit of it . I did some checking . A man rented a van the same night Mr. Johnson was killed . Son of a bitch used Johnson 's own credit card . What is he doing here ? Just sharing information with us , Captain . I just got back to the mayor 's office . The media 's having a heyday with this thing out here . Now , I need something . And I need it fast . We just don 't have any solid leads yet . I want it . And I want it fast . Or I 'm going to find two guys who can get the job done . You understand ? Who ? Don 't push me , Evans . You are still wet behind the ears . Real sweetheart . But you know , there is a little moisture back there . Very funny . I 'll tell you something , Talbot . I could out-investigate that asshole any day of the week . [ Phone ringing ] Williams . Yeah . Yeah , we 'll be right there . What is it ? Another body . Let 's go . Well , who is she ? Some bimbo I rented the dump to . What 's her name ? Lisa Fields . That 's the girl from the car rental agency . She was supposed to leave this morning for vacation . She said something about her flight being cancelled 'Til later or something . I don 't know . He must have thought she could identify him . Did you see or hear anything ? I was watching the game , OK ? Really ? This girl is getting her throat torn out Right down the hall from you ... Bill . And you didn 't hear a thing ? I saw a guy ... I saw a guy in a business suit ... you know , A business kind of guy . What 'd he look like ? What color hair or eyes ? He had long dark hair . But look , I just thought they were having , Like , a lover 's quarrel . OK ? Did he see you ? I was looking through the peephole . Sir , we 'd like to have you come down to the station , Give a description to our police artist . I 'm watching the game . Like , can we do it tomorrow ? No . Oh , and we 'd like your mind as clear as possible . Have you guys read this ? Who let this out , huh ? Hey , chief , maybe they figured it out on their own . Real cute , Evans . When 's the last time you had a drug test , huh ? Watch it , Talbot . Is he always like this ? This is one of his good days . Jack , here 's the artist sketch of our suspect . Wait a minute , I know this guy . Didn 't he just leave the office ? No , but they 're probably related . I just got something from the bank That you ladies might be interested in . What you got ? Eh , no so fast . Follow me . Ooh , this could be important . This is some weird shit . ATM surveillance . Where did she go ? Your guess is as good as mine , bud . Rewind that . Is someone screwing around ? I 'm gonna go to the library , do some research . I have an idea . All right . I want to see this one more time . Yeah , play that again . Rewind . You scared me . I 'm sorry . I just need some information . Do you have any books on vampires ? Vampires ? Did you try cinema ? Film books ? No , not those kind , real ones ... reports , stories , True accounts of vampirism . Nonfictional vampire 's . Well , all I could suggest is mythology , Religious superstition . No , not mythology , not superstition . I 'm talking about the undead ... You know , walking , talking , Blood-sucking vampires . Sir , you are wasting my time . Look , I 'm an agent with the FBI . This information is related to a case I 'm working on . It 's very important . You 're not joking . Are you ? No , I 'm not . Follow me . There are many accounts of vampirism Located in this section . The occult . Yes . The occult 's a fascinating subject . Oh , you may think me a little crazy . But I especially enjoy reading books About paranormal experiences , extraterrestrial abductions , Possessions . No , no . Just vampires . Oh , just vampires . " Los Vampiros de la Noche . " Do you speak Spanish ? No . In English , please . Oh , English . Oh , let 's see . We have " Nightlife of the Urban Vampire , " " Red-blooded , American Stalker , " " New England Vampire Chronicles . " That one , " New England Vampire Chronicles . " Yes . I 've read this one . Oh , if I recall , it 's quite disturbing . During the relocation of a cemetery in Massachusetts , They unearthed a couple of coffins , And found stakes driven through the sternums of the skeletons . Their chests ? Well , yeah . All right . I 'll take that one . Yes ! Yes ! This is it ! What is it ? " The Vampire Hunter 's Companion , " of course . That is , if you 're planning on meeting one . What does one look like ? Oh , they can take many forms ... rats , Pigs , wolves , bats , even fog . Fog ? They prefer bats . In that form , they can take flight . Did you know that vampires hate the sunlight ? Everyone knows that . And they shy away from all that is holy . You mean , like crosses , holy water , that sort of thing . Well , not just holy water , any kind of water . Really ? Oh , yes . Sometimes vampires place their victims in a pool of water To prevent them from rising from the dead . This practice eliminates the possibility Of more of their kind , and leaves more victims for them . It 's a little selfish , perhaps . But it works . That 's great . You 've been very helpful . Listen , I 'll take those two . But you haven 't answered my question . What question ? Are You 're planning to meet one ? Better give me all of them . [ Clock chimes ] As the late as the 19th century , people Desperate to stop attacks from vampires Unearthed corpses and drove wooden stakes Into their hearts . New England grave sites recently unearthed for relocation showed Several skeletons with stakes apparently Driven into their chests . Some coffins were found empty . The police have no explanation as to why . [ Scream ] Sir , the library closes in five minutes . Did you find what you 're looking for ? Yes . Thank you . MAN ( ON TV ) : He 's out there . He 's watching . He 's waiting . " Don 't Look Out the Window . " 15 cheerleaders , and he wants the all dead . [ Thud and breaking glass ] MAN ( ON TV ) : Who is he ? What was that ? It 's probably the dogs . Go see . You go see . All right , I will . MAN ( ON TV ) : And especially Rebecca . " Don 't Look Out the Window ... " a hideous journey Into the mind of a madman . " Don 't Look Out the Window . " [ Scream ] Honey , what 's the matter ? There 's somebody outside . Where ? Damn dogs . What was it ? The dogs knocked over the trash again . It wasn 't any dog that was looking in that window . Maybe it was a peeping Tom . Are you sure there 's nobody out here ? ( SPOOKY VOICE ) Sherri , Sherri . Stop it . You 're not funny . Oh , come on . Are we going to watch the rest of the movie ? [ Splat ] Tommy ? [ Growl ] [ Police radio chatter ] Hey , put her down . [ Hiss ] [ Grunt ] [ Growl ] So what do you think ? I don 't know . He 's got to be on something . How in the hell did he get out of that car ? It was completely on fire . Nothing human could have survived that . What if he 's not human ? What ? I 've been on the trail of the killer for over a year . Some things just don 't add up . Like what ? Like the fact that all the bodies were Completely drained of blood . The coroner 's office can 't explain it . What are you trying to say ? Remember when we were kids , we 'd Tell stories to try and scare the shit out of each other ? When we closed our eyes , we could see a monster . [ Scoffs ] Yeah . And once , I dropped acid , and I seen the walls melt . What are you trying to stay ? When I close my eyes , I can see him . Are you crazy ? You 're talking about a vampire ... Christopher Lee , Bela Lugosi , that sort of thing ? No . That 's in the movies . This is real . And you better believe it , kid . Oh , man . I 'm sorry . This just isn 't the sort thing we covered in the Academy . They 're gonna lock you up , Talbot . I 've gone it over in my head a million times . That 's the only thing that makes any sense . I 'm going to have nightmares for a week Thinking about all this . I 've been doing some research . There are actual cases of vampirism Dating back centuries . It 's not from a bunch of quacks , guys . These accounts were written , priests , government officials . I though tuberculosis was the cause of most of those cases . In most cases . But if just one of these cases is real , We 've got a big problem . I don 't know . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you actually want us to believe that we 're Dealing with a real vampire ? Yes I do . I started to suspect it myself when my partner was murdered . He was given a lead by a psychic . Oh , wow , a psychic . Her name was Ann Voorhies . She had given him the address of what she Thought was the killer 's house . She told him he was in danger . He wanted to check out a hunch ... cocky kid . He didn 't show up for work the next day . I took a team over to the house . We went in the back . This horrible stench ... Smelled like death . I was the first one in the basement . I found Guthrie 's body and six other corpses . The killer must 've been onto us , because there Wasn 't any sign of him . At first , I thought the psychic woman was part of it . Now I don 't . We gotta find him , and fast . Um , you know , I think we should keep this between ourselves . I mean , we 've got enough problems with the captain . That 's a good idea . I think I 'm gonna need another drink . Yeah , make it a double . [ Door opening ] [ Door shuts ] Topping our headlines tonight , a barrage Of unsolved areas plaguing the area have police baffled . Investigators from the city police and sheriff 's department Still have no suspects . The FBI has been called in to help with the investigation . You blame us ? Jesus , Phil . You think you can do any better , why don 't you pick up a badge ? Is there a serial killer on the loose In our once peaceful city ? Police still are not saying if the murders are connected . [ Dog barking ] [ Thud ] [ Dog whimpers ] This our missing rental van ? Yeah , it is . Highway patrol picked it up this morning . Take a look at this . Looks like something was slid in and out . Like a coffin ? Yeah . Where 's Bill ? I don 't know . He was supposed to meet me here this morning . I haven 't seen him . We called , there 's no answer . It 's just not like him .

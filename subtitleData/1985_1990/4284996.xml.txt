 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf . The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak . The only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew . The most interesting event recently was that Lister pretended he 'd passed the chef 's exam . That gives you some idea of how exciting some days are around here . Holly , give me access to the crew 's confidential reports . Those are for the Captain 's eyes only . Fine . We 'll give him ten seconds to come back from the dead , then we 'll presume I 'm in charge . - No , he hasn 't managed it . - Whose do you want ? Give me ... Give me Lister 's . Just the remarks . David Lister , technician , 3rd class . Captain 's remarks - " Has requested sick leave due to diarrhoea " on no less than 500 occasions . " Left previous job as a supermarket trolley attendant after ten years " because he didn 't want to get tied to a career . " Promotion prospects - zero . " I always liked Captain Hollister . Such a great reader of men . A marvellous , marvellous man , and a tragic loss to us all . All right , Holly , give me mine . Arnold Rimmer , technician , 2nd class . Captain 's remarks - " If a job 's worth doing , it 's worth doing well . " If it 's not , give it to Rimmer . " He aches for responsibility but constantly fails the engineering exam . " Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Holly , Holly ... MY report - Rimmer . Two Ms. " Astoundingly zealous . Possibly mad . " Probably has more teeth than brain cells . " Promotion prospects - comical . " Two Rs . Arnold , this is your report . I always hated that pus-head Hollister . He always resented my popularity . He ignored my proposal to reduce the minimum haircut length by an eighth of an inch . Small-minded , petty-thinking modo . Arnold , I 'm picking up an unidentified object . " Constantly fails the exam " ? I 'd hardly call 11 times " constantly " . If you eat beef 11 times in your life , one would hardly say that person constantly eats beef . It would be a rare , nay , freak occurrence . " Possibly mad " ? ! What 's he drivelling about ? - It 's on the screen , Arnie . - What is it ? - I don 't know . - You 'd better find out . It 's obviously beyond me . I 've got more teeth than brain cells . Yes , you have . ( SNIFFS ) ( TOASTER ) Would you like some toast ? - Uh-uh . - Some nice buttered toast ? Uh-uh . - No toast , then ? No . - What about a muffin ? - Nothing . You last had toast 18 days ago . 11.36 , Tuesday 3rd . Two rounds . Shh ! Why buy a toaster with artificial intelligence if you don 't like toast ? - I do like toast . - I mean , this is my jobl - This is just cruel . - I 'm busy . - Not busy eating toast , are you ( ? ) - I don 't want any ! The purpose of my existence is to serve you with scrummy toast . If you don 't want any , my existence is meaningless . - Good . - I toast , therefore I am . Will you shut up ? ( SNIFFS ) What are you doing ? - I 'm reading . - With your nose ? It 's a cat book . They use smells . You run your nose along and different smells are released . What a pathetic idea . Unlike you , my mind is open to new cultures , new ways of looking at things . - And what does it say ? - It says , " See Dick run . " Run , Dick , run . " Run ... home , Dick . " That 's the cat equivalent of Shakespeare , is it ? Shakespeare ? Who 's Shakespeare ? You moron . An old playwright . Wilfred Shakespeare . I 'm just starting . This is for three-year-olds . You should try it . I 'm not interested in smelling anything cats have to say . You don 't know what you 're missing . There 's one where Dick buys this ball ... this big ball ... this big red ball . It 's amazing stuff . You ought to try reading your shirt . It 's probably a novel by Victor Hugo . Anyway , if you 're interested , Holly 's spotted ... Is that my shirt ? - Yeah . I borrowed it . - What 's that ? That 's definitely biscuit . Erm , that 's custard ... Ink ... just general sort of dirty marks . - You can 't go through my possessions ! - You don 't need them . - Because I 'm dead ? - Yeah . Holograms don 't need clothes . They 're mine ! Would you steal verruca cream from a man with no feet ? What if I stole your favourite T-shirt with the custard stains ? - I wouldn 't care . - Stay out of my wardrobe . 0K , 0K . You keep your underpants on coat-hangers , don 't you ? That 's private ! 0K , Rimmer , 0K . Take the shirt back . I don 't want it . You 've sweated in it . - What D0 you want ? - Just keep out of my things . - 0K , 0K . What 's Holly spotted ? - An unidentified object . - You mean a rock . - It might not be . - They 're always rocks . - Mostly , I agree , but maybe this one 's different . There 's nobody out there . No alien monsters , no Zargon warships , no beautiful blondes with beehive hairdos , who say , " Show me more of this thing called kissing . " There 's just us , the Cat and lots of smegging rocks . That 's it . Finito . If that 's true , what 's the point of existence ? Beats me . Do you want some toast ? ( HOLLY ) Arnold , the unidentified object is now in visual range . All right , Holly . I 'm on my way . Aow ! Nice jump . Hey ! Smooth with a capital " smoo " . 0K , time to get out the food detector . This way . Aow ! 0oh ! Yeah , yeah ! This way . Aow ! This way ! Ah , you . Where have you been ? Investigating . Investigating this , investigating that . - General investigation . - General investigation , eh ? - Ah , splendid ! - Thank you . - Keep it up . - 0K . Fine . Well , excuse me ... Hey ! You can 't have my shiny thing ! It 's mine . What are you drivelling about ? This is my shiny thing . If you try and take it , I 'll eat you . It 's a yo-yo , you modo . It does two amazing things . 0ne , you have the shiny thing at the top , or - and this is the clever part - you have the string at the top . ( LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY ) Wowee ! You haven 't the slightest clue what it 's for , do you ? Sure I do , grease stain . You hold the shiny thing and go ... Aow ! The string 's moving ! Hey ! Stop that thing ! Catch that string ! - Where is it ? - It 's in scoop range , Arnold . It 's a pod ! Holly , bring it in ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! I 'm back ! Feeling good ! Feed me . I haven 't seen you for ages . Where 've you been ? - Investigating . - Got you some crispies . Yeah , yeah , yeah ! I read the book . It 's got a brilliant ending . I could hardly believe me nose . Forget that . Got you the one you asked about . The Holy Book . 0h , great ! ( SNIFFS ) Hey ! Pictures ! Yeah ! That 's a cat thing . In books , we have drawings of things and call them " pictures " . We have pictures , too . You monkeys are smarter than I thought . - This is me ! - That 's not you . That 's Cloister . He was the father of the cat people . - Who 's that ? - That 's him frozen in time . That 's me in stasis . That 's what " frozen in time " is . - He did that to save Frankenstein . - Frankenstein was my pet cat ! Look , Lister , Cloister . Cloister , Lister ! See ? Listen , you stupid monkey , Cloister 's another name for God ! That 's what I 'm saying . I am your God . 0K . Turn this into a woman . - I 'm serious . - So am I ! Look , Frankenstein was my pet cat , right ? And she was pregnant . I got put into suspended animation for three million years . - You oversleep ? So do I. - No ! I 'm saying that over those three million years , your entire race evolved from my pet cat . Ah , I gotta go now , man , but let 's do lunch some time . I 'll put it in my diary . " 12.30 , lunch with God . " Formal dress , you know what I 'm saying ? It is true , you know . Then the ultimate question is , if you 're God , why that face ? - What 's wrong with my face ? - What 's wrong ? It 's upside down and inside out , that 's what 's wrong with it . Aow ! - Holly ? - Yes , Dave ? If I give you my cat dictionary , can you translate this ? ( HOLLY ) I 'll give it a go , Dave . ( TOASTER ) I 'll do it . You 're a toaster . I 'm packing it in . I 'm becoming something I don 't like . - I 'm not a moaner . - No , you 're a toaster . It just strikes me that there might be something more , something unimaginably more splendid than heating bread . Lister , it 's arrived ! - What has ? - The U0 ! It 's a pod ! - Where ? - The observation room . No point in running , Lister . It 's mine . I found it . I 've got bagsies . He 's such a child , that boy . - Is it safe , Holly ? - Yes , Dave . No point in running . It 's mine . Calm down . Dead people can have heart attacks , too . - What is it ? - It 's obviously some alien capsule , and clearly they 're intelligent , Lister . The chance to meet an intelligent life form after 18 weeks with you . 0K , Mr Intelligence , what are those markings ? Well , I don 't know . I don 't speak alien , you gimboid . ( SATISFIED SIGH ) What are you doing ? It 's quarantined ! You might get some slimy thing stuck to your face ! 0f course it 's safe . Come in . Come on ... ( GASPS ) Ha-ha-ha ( ! ) Tee-hee ( ! ) All right , we 'll play it your way . But don 't think you 're coming out . You 're in quarantine . - What did you say , Rimmer ? - Why do you never do what I say ? There 's a reason why I 'm your superior . You 've been here 15 years , I 've been here eight months . No , it 's because I 'm better than you . Better trained , better equipped , better ... Better . Just ... better . So , everyone else is better than you . No , I 'm not going to let you bait me . This is too important . Just you wait here till I get back with the skutters . 0h , Rimmer 's such a smeghead , man . Hey , hang on a minute . Give me an R ... Give me an E ... Give me a D ... Give me a Red Dwarf garbage pod ! Holly ? Did Rimmer never work in waste disposal ? No , Dave . It 's one of our garbage pods with the writing burnt off in places . - Why didn 't you tell him ? - Well , it 's a laugh , innit ? ( RIMMER ) After intensive investigation , comma , of the markings on the alien pod , comma , it has become clear , comma , to me , comma , that we are dealing , comma , with a species of awesome intellect , colon . ( HOLLY ) Good . Perhaps they can help with your punctuation . ( RIMMER ) Shut up . ( SN0RING ) Lights . Are you awake ? Lister ? Lister ? ( SCREAMS ) Lister ! - Are you awake ? - Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I couldn 't sleep either . - It 's the excitement . - What excitement ? - The alien excitement ! - Rimmer , it 's garbage . You can scoff , Lister . They laughed at Galileo . They laughed at Edison . - They laughed at Columbo . - Who 's Columbo ? The man with the dirty mac who discovered America . - What makes you think aliens exist ? - They must do , Lister . There 's so many things that we don 't have an explanation for . Like why do intelligent people buy cinema hot dogs ? That sort of thing ? No , Lister , I mean like the pyramids . How did they move such massive stones without modern technology ? They had massive whips , Rimmer . Massive , massive whips . All right , then , the Bermuda Triangle . Go on , explain that one . No , that is a genuine mystery . How did that song ever become a hit ? Why do I bother ? I 'd get more sense out of a squashed hedgehog . Don 't you ever wonder why we 're here ? What 's the grand purpose ? Why does it have to be such a big deal ? Humans might be a planetary disease , like Earth 's got German measles or facial herpes , right ? That 's why the other planets give us such a wide berth . It 's like , " Don 't go near Earth , it 's got human beings ! " So , you 're saying , Lister , you 're an intergalactic , pus-filled sore ? At last , Lister , we agree on something . What about you ? Do you believe in God ? Certainly not ! What a preposterous thought ! I believe in aliens , Lister . 0h , right , fine . Something sensible at last . Aliens with technology so advanced we can 't even begin to imagine . That 's not difficult . Mankind can 't even create a toupee that doesn 't get laughs . Aliens who can give me a real body . 0oh , I can 't wait to see your face in the morning , I really can 't . Nor I yours , when that pod opens and from it emerges a beautiful alien woman with long green hair and six breasts . Six breasts ? ! Imagine making love to a woman with six breasts ! Imagine making love to a woman . Good morning . How can I help you ? - Bonjour . Um , give me breakfast . - What would you like ? Er ... chicken vindaloo and a milkshake . - What flavour milkshake ? - Um ... beer . ( MACHINE HUMS ) ( HOLLY ) Morning , Dave . I 've finished your translation . - Who 's Cloister ? Is it me ? - Yes . The cats made you their god . Hey ! Working-class kid makes good ! Your plan to move to Fiji and open a diner became their image of heaven . - What ? - " And Cloister spake , " ' Lo , I shall lead you to Fuchal . We shall open a temple of food , " ' wherein shall be sausages and all manner of bountiful things . " ' Yea , even individual sachets of mustard . " ' And those who serve shall wear hats of great majesty , " ' though they be made of cardboard with humorous arrows . " ' Does it say what happened to the rest of the cats ? Holy wars , thousands of years of fighting between the two factions . - What two factions ? - The ones who wanted red hats and those who wanted blue hats . They had a war over whether the diner hats were red or blue ? Yeah . Most of them were killed . It 's daft really , innit ? You 're not kidding . They were supposed to be green . - Go on , Hol . - Finally , they called a truce , built two arks and left Red Dwarf in search of Fuchal . But there 's no such place . How would they find it ? " Cloister gave to Frankenstein the sacred writing , " saying , ' Those who have wisdom will know its meaning . ' " And it was written thus . Seven socks , one shirt ... " That 's my laundry list ! I lined the cat 's basket with it ! They thought it was a chart leading to the promised land . Well , it wasn 't . It was my dirty washing . What happened next , Hol ? " And the first ark followed the sacred signs , " and lo , they flew straight into an asteroid . " The second ark flew ever onward , knowing they were indeed righteous . " This is terrible . Holy wars . Killing . They 're using religion as an excuse to be extremely crappy to each other . So , what else is new ? I 'm not interested . They killed each other over cardboard hats . - I 'm not interested . - Isn 't it amazing ? People who didn 't eat hot dogs on Fuchal Day were stoned to death by stale doughnuts . What should I say ? " Congratulations , you 're God " ? I 'm talking about the suffering . People died . I mean cats ... Cat people died . You 're just rubbing my nose in it . I could 've been God , given the lucky show-biz break you had . - I don 't want to be a god . - Vomitisation ! I don 't believe it ! " I 'm God , but it 's a drag . " Come on ! I 'm not a god ! I 've just been ... misquoted . Anyone who reads meaning into any old gobbledygook deserves everything they get . If I 'd had eight socks on my list , or if I owned more than one pair of underpants , they might 've have been safe . I wish I could meet them and apologise . Well , that would look spectacular . God returns in all his splendour , and says , " Sorry for the cock-up ! " - I didn 't ask to become their god ! - I didn 't ask to be killed . Life 's a bitch . Now smeg off , I 'm busy . They just made stuff up . I 'm supposed to have given them five sacred laws . I 've broken four myself . I 'd have broken the fifth , but there 's no sheep on board . - Bye-bye . - What sort of holy writ is this ... ? - " It is a sin to be cool . " - I 'm sick of hearing about cats ! My concerns are more meaningful than stupid smegging cardboard hats ! I 'm trying to decipher this ! This is science . You can smirk , but I believe the Quagaars ... - Quagars ? - Quagaars ! It 's a name I made up . Double A. I believe the Quagaars can give me a new body ! - Never mind this tot , where 's the Cat ? - Tot ? ! - Tot . - Tot ? ! - Tot ! - Tot ? ! We 'll see what 's tot . The quarantine period 's nearly up ! Bastard ! Cat ? Cat ? ( H0NKS H0RN ) Holly , where 's the Cat ? He 's no longer in my supervision field . He 's on the cargo decks . I lost him as he entered Supply Pipe 28 . Cat ? Cat ? Cat ! Come on , Cat . Miaow ! Come on , kitty , kitty ! Cat , come on . The crispies are getting warm . Come on . Cat , come on . Aow ! Yeah ! Yeah-yeah-yeah ! Hey , fellas ! Yes , sir . I 'm back ! Feeling good ! Feed me . You 're always leaving . Where do you go ? Investigating ! See , I have these feet ... - I 'm dying . - I 'm telling you about my feet . - My investigating feet . - Don 't you hear me ? I 'm dying ! Yeah , but I 'm talking about my feet . Why should you listen to me , a blind old priest that 's lost his faith ? I 'm not listening . I 'm talking about my feet . - What do you care ? - I don 't care ! You 're the one who 's dying . Why should it spoil my evening ? Cat ? Cat ? 0oh , when I get you , I 'm going to turn you into a kebab . Holly ? Can you still hear me ? Cat ? Here . Burn the sacred hat . That 's a fearsome hat . Burn it ! It 's a symbol of the lies . - It 's burnt . - All my life I 've served a lie . Because you 're not there , Cloister , are you ? You 've never been there ! Y0U D0N 'T EXIST ! - Who 's that ? - It is I , Cloister ! - Who is it , boy ? - It 's Cloister . I 've returnethed . Is it him ? Is it truly him ? - Does he look like a king ? - A king ? ! Yeah ! Is he wearing the doughnut and golden sausage ? Yeah ! Then it truly is him ! 0h , I 've failed you , Cloister . All these years , I kept my faith . I wore the Holy Custard Stain and the Sacred Gravy Marks . I renounced coolness , and chose the righteous path of slobbiness . But in the end , I failed you . Why didn 't you go on the arks with the other cats ? They left us behind . The sick and the lame . Left us to die . But then the boy was born to the cripple and the idiot . - What idiot ? - Your father , boy . - My father was a jellybrain ? - That 's why he ate his own feet . I did wonder . As one by one we died , my faith died also . You tested me , Cloister , and I failed you . 0h , no , you didn 't fail , old man . You passed . I 'm giving you ... I 'm giving you an A + distinction . There 's a place for me on Fuchal ? A place ? Got your own bathroom , en suite , cork floors , your own barbecue on the patio , a phone , everything ! 0h ! My hat ! I 've burned my sacred hat ! No , you haven 't ! A miracle ! This is the happiest day of my ... ( GR0ANS ) Did I ever tell you about my investigating feet ? 0nce , there was an old man ... Well ? Are you ready , Rimmer ? 0pen it ! 0pen it ! - Well ? What 's there ? - Are you sure you 're ready ? Yes ! Come on , you gimboid ! Incredible ! A stupendous moment in my own personal history ! The perfectly preserved remains of a Quagaar warrior ! Yeah , right , Rimmer . Absolutely . They must have looked something like ... a roast chicken . # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere ... # ( RIMMER ) It 's a garbage pod ! # I 'm all alone , more or less ... # ( RIMMER ) It 's a smegging garbage pod ! # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

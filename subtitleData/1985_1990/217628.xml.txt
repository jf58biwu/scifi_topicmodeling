I already told you , that it`s hard to scare me ! You like it ? I can`t show you more of it . That`s supposed to be a punishment . I ´ m sure of it . I told you that this can`t scare me . Don`t leave me alone ... You`re not scared , are you ? That whore did this ? That`s incredible ! How did you get till here ? You got a piece of metal in your brain . How can you still be alive ? Who`s the little genius , who did this to you ? You will die , if you try to remove it . Be aware that it`s a gift . There it is , it`s repaired . Alright , you started again ? Useless to adapt . I know everything about you . You won`t escape me . Die , metallic monster ! Die ! What`s going on ? He`s watching us ! He`s looking at us ! Darling ... he`s watching us ! That`s fantastic !

Move ! Are you aware of all the rust in my body ? My first metallic implant is already rusted before my cells started assimilating . But your shaver was supposed to be stainless . I will kill you ! I`m annoying you ! You understand ? Your fate is the metal ! You wanna rust and die of it ? It`s useless to resist ! What a marvellous sensation ! We can transform the whole world into metal and it will rust until it becomes cosmic dust . That`s what we will do . Our love might be able to destroy that fucked up world . Let`s kill them !

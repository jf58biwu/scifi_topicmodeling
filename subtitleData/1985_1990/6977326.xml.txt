I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . This doesn 't look right . What doesn 't look right about it ? Well , according to this , we should 've gone by a couple of town by now . This looks like the Twilight Zone . What 's wrong ? Are we low on gas or something ? There 's plenty of fuel . Five amps , low pressure is in the green but the power plans seems to be fading . What do you think ? I think we need a mechanic . Well , can 't you use the sphere to fix it ? I could if I knew what to fix ! I mean , you can travel across the galaxy but you can 't fix a car ? I 'm a navigator . I wish I 'd inherited some of those navigational genes . I 've landed us on the dark side of the moon . I saw a dirt road and a rusty mailbox back there . Yeah , what did it say ? Bates Motel ? Why do I get the feeling that we are gonna find nothing but bones out here ? You watch too many spooky movies . Look who 's talking ! Talk about the middle of nowhere . I see electricity equipment . No phone lines . Maybe nobody 's home . We 're being watched . Are you trying to scare me ? No . What do you want ? Our car broke down on the road . We ain 't got a phone here . We know . Is there someone around here who does have one ? There ain 't no-one else around here . It is the Bates Motel . What ? Nothing . What 's the matter with your car ? I don 't know . Can you tell me where the nearest mechanic is ? North . 40 miles . Can you give us a lift ? I don 't go into town but once a month . And that 's a couple of days from now . Thanks . I only go in once a month . And that 's enough for me . I understand . Thank you . Hey ! Stay in our old bunk house tonight if you wanted . Thank you ! We have a camper . Warm in there . But you suit yourselves . There 's a storm coming up . Thank you , we will ... Friendly , isn 't he ? They seemed harmless enough . A man with a young son ought to be more careful when they 're stuck out here . That 's no reason to be rude ! I don 't know of a better one . I guess he was right . Yeah , it looks like a another long , hungry night . There 's an apple in the camper . I 'd drown before I got there . Besides , we 're eavesdropping on nights like these ? More Bates Motel ? Yeah , go ahead an laugh but rude things do happen . You mean like , erm ... An alien from space landing on the planet ? We 're having chicken for supper . Are you , erm ... Inviting us ? If you like . Yes ! We 'd like ! I 'm Mary Radin . The man you spoke to is my husband , Frank . We 're not used to having visitors . Well , I 'm Paul Forrester and this is ... Suppose the food 's poisoned ? How hungry are you ? Yeah , OK , but I 'm gonna let them take the first bite . Sorry but we 're dripping water . Come in . Sit down . This is our daughter , Julie . Julie , there are the people I told you about . The father is sitting across from you and the boy on his left . Hello ! Hello ! Hi ! Lord , we thank you for this , your bounty , protect us through the years , from the evils of the world . - and Satan 's Saracens . Amen . - Amen . What are your names ? - Paul . - Scott . Hi . What 's the matter ? You ain 't never seen a blind person before ? No . So , how long have you lived here ? Frank ! What ? The man asked you how long we 've lived here . I heard him . Since just before Julie was born . 18 years . Must be kind of hard living so far away from everything . If it wasn 't what we wanted , we wouldn 't be living here . Your son got me off my dish-washing chore . How did you know I was out here ? I sensed you standing here . I can see with my ears and my hands and my nose . Something else too . I can 't really explain it but ... Ma says God gave it to me just to kind of balance things out . The nearest town , what 's it like ? I don 't know . I 've never been away from here . Well , not since I was five . What do you do ? I 'm a photographer . Of what ? Oh , different things . We travel around a lot . Oh , that must be wonderful . See new places and new things ... And then having pictures of it all , it 's kind of like having the world in your pocket . We have been to a lot of places . Ma says I 'm pretty . Do you think so ? Yes . Can I see what you look like ? I can ... If you let me touch your face . - Could I ? - Sure ! Julie ? Yes , Pa ? It 's getting too damp out here for you . But it stopped raining , Pa . It 'll start up again . You come on inside and get ready for bed . Pa , it 's early . Your mama says you need to wash your hair . Alright , Pa . Good-night , Paul . Good-night . I 'll go down take a look at your camper in the morning . Maybe it can be fixed without a mechanic . Thank you . Then you can be on your way . Yes . You think we can get out of here tomorrow ? I hope so . Good . This place gives me the creeps . I mean something weird is going on here . I don 't think they like people . Julie hasn 't been off this place since she was five years old . Why ? Is she a prisoner or something ? No , I don 't think so . Maybe something else . What ? I don 't know . Something I 've never come up against .

What are you doing here ? Come here ! Here you go . It 's me , Paul . How did you know I was here ? That was easy ! Your shadow cut off the field of sun . Besides , I heard you . There 's so much you know . So much I don 't know too . Of course I listen to TV . Mostly " The Way of the Lord " though , through its Ministers . Nothing else ? What do you think ? Of course I do . I know all about Spencer and Crystal and JR . It 's pretty much of a mess out there , isn 't it ? Well , I don 't know . Parts of it , I guess . Most of the people I 've met are very nice . Yeah , I thought so . I figured that out . Otherwise everything would be destroyed , wouldn 't it ? Why ? You don 't know your Scriptures , do you ? I guess not . I fibbed last night . When I said that I hadn 't been away from here since I was five ? I used to go to Church meetings with them . Usually in a big tent . Kind of a room with soft walls . Watch the people and kids . Chewy ? Chewy ? Julie ! It 's burning ! What 's ... what 's happening ? What 's happening ? What are you doing ? You 're alright now . Oh , Lord . Oh , Lord . No , wait a minute ! You 're leaping to conclusions . - Oh ! - Julie . - Help me , help me , please , help me heal me , please . - Julie , Julie ... You 're making a mistake . Don 't deny what you are . God sent you , you have the gift . It 's in your hands , you 're a healer . Please ! Make me see . We prayed for a miracle , now here you are . Julie wait , listen to me , you 're wrong . I 'm not what you think . I 'm begging you . I wanna go , I wanna go out there , and see for myself , I wanna know for myself . - Please , please heal me . - Julie , you 're not listening . Why are you saying this ? It 's the truth . Is it because I 'm a simple person , is it cos I 'm a bad person ? I 'm not . I 'm a good person , I say my prayers at night . Ma ! What is it ? What happened ? Nothing . I fell . You were in the barn with him . Nothing happened . Hey , he can fix it . Spark plugs and a hose . You 'll be on the road in an hour . - We 're in trouble . - No ! He can really fix it . I had to use the sphere . Julie knows about it , she called me a healer . A what ? She wants me to make her see . Can you ? No . We 're in trouble . I don 't know what to do about this . Got any ideas ? Me ? No . Look , when you try it and it doesn 't work , tell her the Moon wasn 't in the right position or something and we have to wait a day . This isn 't a time for joking . I think I was serious . Julie ? Julie , open the door . Honey , please . I wanna know what happened . Just leave me alone , OK ? Stop acting like a baby and open the door . All right , tell me , what did he do ? Nothing , Ma , I already told you . - What did he try to do ? - You just don 't understand , do you , Ma ? Why do you keep treating me like I 'm eight years old ? You know why . Cos you 're not like other girls . Women ! I 'm a woman , not a girl ! OK , I 'm blind . But the rest of me is whole , isn 't it ? I mean , the rest of me is like another woman , isn 't it ? What the hell 's got you all riled up , what ... ? You 're standing there like you was aching to hit me . I 'm not a simple person , am I , Ma ? Of course not . I 'm not blind because I sinned , am I ? Child , where 'd you get such ideas ? Then why won 't he heal me ? It is not up to us to question the Lord 's will . Not God ! Him ! Paul ! He 's got the gift , Ma . He 's got the gift and he won 't use it on me to make me see . Did he tell you that ? Did he tell you he was a healer ? I 've never heard such nonsense . And you believe him ? It 's true . You don 't have to tell me ... - I was a witness . - To what ? A miracle in healing . Here you go . You got to fill up that radiator with water before you start the truck up . Here . Thanks . You really wanna thank me , you leave Julie alone . Leave her alone ? She lives a safe and simple life out here . That 's the way her mum and I want it for her . I don 't think that 's what she wants . You know damned well what there is out there for her . Nothing but a lot pain and grief for a girl like that . Wouldn 't it be more painful for her if ... this is all she knew for the rest of her life ? Look , I didn 't expect you 'd understand . Just do what I ask . You can fill up the rest when we run up the house . Lucky for us you know about these things . Hmm . I 'll take a lift up to the house since you 're going that way . It 's almost full ! Should I keep it running ? Do what the man said . Julie ! Come on down now , Julie ! Yes , Pa ? Your Ma 's been telling me about something strange . What 'd you say happened in that barn ? I didn 't call it strange . You 're the one who says miracles happen everyday , aren 't you ? Well , there 's all kinds of miracles . Like when a tree comes up or a flower blooms . You know what I 'm talking about . Like when Jesus fed the multitudes , and when he raised the dead , it 's all in the Book , isn 't it ? You 're talking about the Bible , you 're talking about Jesus . Not some drifter in a beat-up camper who just happened by . What 's gotten into you , child ? What kind of devil you got inside your head ? Stop calling me child . How do you know , how do you know he just happened by ? How do you know he wasn 't sent ? Now , don 't get riled ! Why does it always have to be the devil ? And what about all those preachers that you took me to listen to ? And all the healing that was going on that you said was real ? Are we just pretending to believe ? Don 't you believe in God ? Of course we do ! What kind of a question is that ? I was there . I know what happened . What ? What 'd he say , this ... healer ? What difference does it make ? I know what I know . What 'd he say ? He said he wasn 't one . Well , at least he ain 't an out con-man . You don 't know him ! All I had to do was touch his face and I knew . He 's not like you . He 's not like anybody else I 've ever been around . Right off , I knew he was different . And there 's nothing that you can say that 's gonna make change my mind . I 've had just about enough sass out of you . You know what I think ? I think you don 't want me to see . I think you don 't want to go out in the world and find out what life is about . Well , I know I 'm going to go , I know as sure as I know that that man is a healer . Our camper 's ready , thanks to you . I 'd like to talk to Julie for a moment if I may . No , Sir . You don 't go one step near her . You 've done enough damage already . She told you what happened ? I don 't know what your game is . All I know is I want you off my property now , before I call the Sheriff . You had no right putting that nonsense inside her head . It was a misunderstanding . Mister , you slept under my roof , you ate at my table , I fixed your engine with all that ... what you 've done to my daughter is no way to repay our kindness . I should 've known better that to put my hand out to a stranger . Believe me , I won 't make that mistake again . Now , both of you , get off my land ! I 'm sorry for the fear that you have inside of you . What fear is that ? Mary , just let him go ! Something else . It 's a great sadness . Dad , come on , let 's go . I feel bad not being able to talk to the girl . I don 't ! I 'm glad we 're out of there . I think they love her . The same way that I love you . Dad , if that 's love , I 'll take vanilla . Vanilla ? It 's a saying . What does it mean ? It means , I don 't want any part of it . So I 'll ... I 'll take vanilla ! Why not chocolate ? Or pistachio ? Or rocky road ? Dad ! That is just a saying , OK ? Talk to whoever made it up . Scott ? Yeah ? How am I doing ? As a father , I mean . You 're OK , I guess . I know you don 't like some of the things I make you do but I give you room to grow , don 't I ? Yeah , but then you get on my pond . But you aren 't doing it . Suppose it shows . Would you like to be locked away from the rest of the world ? You 've never seen a blind person before until Julie . It 's not easy for them . Look out ! Aaah ! Did you hear that ? Hi ! Frank ! Frank ! Julie 's gone ! - No ! - Yes ! She 's gone ! Go with me ? What do you mean " go with me " ? I was meant to go with you ! Why else would you have been sent ? No-one sent me ! Look , I know that the farm is nowhere near other main road . We got lost , it was accidental . I don 't believe in those kinds of accidents . You got lost and you found me . Yes ! And now we found you again and we 're gonna drive you home ! I don 't think so . I do ! If you take me back , I 'm gonna tell them that you kidnapped me , and that you did things to me . What things ? You don 't wanna know . Julie , it 's impossible ! - I can 't help you ! - I don 't believe you ! Look , I know ... I know that it may not happen all at once . But as sure as there is healing in the world , you 're gonna make me see . What if they didn 't stop in town ? We 'll keep going . I got the license number of his camper . They won 't get far . They seemed so nice . A healer ? Huh ? She found a healer . Julie , please , listen , you gotta believe me , if I could make you see , don 't you think I would ? - You will ! - I can 't ! There 's no way you can make me believe that . Yes , there is . Dad , no ! I 've got to . Julie , I 'm going to trust you with my life , and the life of my son . Dad , we don 't even know her ! She won 't betray us , I can feel it . Only the truth will convince her . What are you talking about ? What truth ? When you touched my face , and my arm , that wasn 't me . The body of Paul Forrester , isn 't who I really am . If you 're trying to scare me , I 'm still not gonna change my mind . - I 'm not trying to scare you . - He isn 't . It all started 14 years ago ... When I first came to this planet . Fool girl flirting with the first man to come along ! She wasn 't flirting ! And she 's right ! She is a woman , and she has needs she 's discovering . It 's not fair what we 've done to her . We should move back to the city and put her in school . Let her learn about things . How to get along . We won 't be around for ever . You keep talking about that stuff but you 've been holding on to her as tight as me ! Not for the same reason . And then he found me . And we started to look for my mum . Ever since then we 've just been on the road . You understand ? There are some things I can 't do . - But to make you see ? - I understand . I 'll take you home now . Yeah , yeah you can take me home . You can ride up front with us . No , that 's OK . I 'll ride in the back . You 're frightened ? Yes . There 's nothing to be frightened of . I understand . I just would rather to ride in the back . I 'll help her . You know ? You don 't have to go with him . You don 't get it . He 's my Dad . And I love him . She sure is acting scared . Same way you acted when I first told you who I was , son . Yeah ! - Dad , wait , stop ! - What is it ? Julie ! I just saw her back on the sidewalk ! She 's gone ! - Are you sure this is where you saw her ? - Yeah ! I 'm sure , I 'm positive ! I want her to learn and grow . I 'm just afraid , for us to be alone without her . Our marriage is that hard for you ? Living out here ... it 's not what we started out to do . We didn 't start out wanting a blind daughter either . And whose fault was that ? [ HEY , YOU 'RE OK ? ] [ HEY ! COMING THROUGH ! ] Watch it ! I have a sack of eggs in here . Mister , please . It 's alright , it 's alright , no harm done , no foul . Alright , this town isn 't that big . - You go that way and I 'll go this way . - Alright . And then we meet back at the camper . Hey ! That 's it ! They 're here ! Hurry up !

How do I know you haven 't been making it all up ? Making it up ? Yeah . I mean , you said some pretty strange things . I felt it . I know I was burned . And I couldn 't feel it after you healed me . I 'm gonna put something in your hand . It 's a silver sphere . It 's gonna make you see the truth . Not like other people see . In a special way . For you alone . - I ... - Shhh ... Now , wait . I feel something . What ? I don 't know . What do you see ? See ? In your mind . Darkness . Darkness and lights . Stars . Stars ! Oh , yes ! Stars ! Hundreds and thousands of stars . What else ? Erm ... Another light . A different light . What color ? I don 't know ! It 's blue . The color of the sky ? Sometimes . What is it ? That light , what ... What is it ? It 's me , Julie . It 's who I am . And my home , is beyond the stars . Oh , it 's going . It 's gone . No , don 't cry . It was ... was so beautiful that you really are who you say you are . yes . Well , then ... If you can do these things that are like magic , that nobody else can do ... How come you can 't make me see ? Because it 's not magic . Because I can 't fix something when I don 't know what 's wrong with it . When I first came here , even though I had eyes , I was blind . Like you . Nothing was familiar . Everything was strange . And frightening . Then , I met someone , very special , named Jenny . And I learnt about love . And now I have Scott . Maybe you can 't change that you 're blind . Yes , there are going to be people who will probably try to take advantage of you . But there are other people , kind ... and they 're loving people . They will give you the tools to help you live a life of courage , and pride , and joy . Get away from her ! Daddy ? It 's alright , honey , I 'm here ! You get away from her ! Daddy , wait ! It 's alright , honey , there are police all around , you 're safe now . Come on over by me . - No ! - What ? This is your doing ! What kind of lies you 've been filling her head with ? I don 't lie . Not him . It 's you , Pa . It 's you and Ma . I 'm not gonna go back to living like that . I can 't live in that kind of darkness anymore . Honey , don 't ... You 're blind , sweetheart ! I don 't think she 's talking about that darkness . I think she means the darkness that comes from the walls that you 've built up around her . Will you shut up ? - What are you afraid of ? - I know ! Mum ? Mary ? I won 't say anything , but you 're gonna have to . I can 't ! Not here , not now . You 've got to ! She needs to hear it from you ! What is it ? What are you talking about ? What 's so awful that you can 't tell me ? I caused your blindness . Oh , Daddy ... Oh , it 's true . It 's true . You weren 't born like this . We were driving home one night . And ... I 'd been drinking . And I crashed the car . And I doomed you to a life of darkness . And myself to hell on Earth . I thought God would take pity on us but ... The sins of the fathers . The sins of the fathers . All these years . He 's been afraid that you 'd find out . Afraid that you 'd hate him . I don 't hate you , Daddy . I love you ... I love you both . But right now , it 's time for me . Pa , he didn 't take me . I hid in his camper . I ... I guess I owe you . Dad , run ! Run ! Whoa ! Whoooa ! Hold it ! A false alarm ! What ? We won 't be pressing any charges , it was all a misunderstanding . - You 're sure ? - We 're sure ! We 're sorry we bothered you . Let him out . - Are you alright ? - I am now ! What happened ? How did you straighten everything out ? I 'll tell you all about it later . Julie was right about you , maybe the Lord did send you . Maybe you are some kind of healer . Dad , don 't you start ! He 's just a guy , just the same as you . You have a safe trip , wherever you go . God bless you . Bye ! There 's something about him . The boy too . Something I can 't put my finger on . Mum , don 't you start too !

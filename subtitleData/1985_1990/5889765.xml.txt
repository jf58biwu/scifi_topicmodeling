Don 't bother me ! Understand ? Now , look pretty . That 's good . Look pretty ! - Tachikawa , you put the flash in wrong ! - I 'm sorry . To the right now . Good . Get closer . He 's really strict while working . I 'm surprised . He 's attractive when he 's mean ! Let 's try this one more time . Yes . Okay ! That 's all ! - Good job ! - Thank you very much . You looked cute . On camera , I feel cute . I love posing for photos . I think the water shots were the best . That girl , I want her tonight . Sir . I 'm coming . Wait . Wait . I want some photos from behind . That 's good . The Indians were friendly . They passed the pipe to everyone . In Brazil , the natives share huge joints with each other . And they do cocaine with partners . In a big bowl , sharing everything . You have a good reputation in this business now . You can make it on your own . Hey , are you saying we 're through ? Right . I don 't care if you have other girls . Just don 't leave me . I can 't live without you . Here . Thanks . Asshole . Keep your eyes on the road while your boss is driving . Sorry , sir . I can 't believe you don 't have a drivers license . What 's going on , Asaoka ? It 's getting foggier . And I think we 're lost . It sure looks scary . Don 't you think so ? Where are we ? Tachikawa , do you see anything ? I can 't see anything . - Let 's forget about it . - But ... It was a deer or something . Come on . Let 's go . Don 't worry . It was nothing . But I 'm sure we hit something . You 're pissing me off . - But what if it were a human ? - What ? How fast was I going ? Maybe 20 miles per hour . Not fast enough to hurt anybody . Come on . I 'm tired . Let 's go . It 's time to get moving . What 's wrong with you ? Tachikawa ! That 's enough ! You want me to leave you here ? Asaoka , drive carefully . Hello ? Hey ! - The back door is open ! - Really ? Let 's go inside and rest . If somebody comes , we 'll explain . Let 's go . All right . Ladies first . I see . It 's under construction . Tachikawa . Yes ? - See if there 's food or drink . - What if someone 's here ? Stupid . If somebody is here , just give them some money . I 'm wondering if you 're scared . He 's still nervous from the road . And if we spend the night here ... s-c-a-r-y ! No way ! Oh god ! There 's no choice . Fog is too thick . Thanks , Tachikawa . Yeah , it 's good . Tastes good . It 's good . This is very good . - Is this mine ? - Right . Picture-man . What is it , sir ? I think we should separate . Are you talking about work ? No , about the girl . Let 's wait for a bit . I have a deal with a new client . Yes , of course , my dear boss . I 'm only asking a favor . You 're done with her anyway , right ? - How about Kazuyo instead ? - Are you kidding me ? Her sweat smells like yours . She 's very good . And very photogenic . If you keep shooting her , we 're going to lose money . And I 'm not joking . I 'll be listening to your nasty grunts later . You 're risking your reputation . Come on , I always give jobs to you and the girls in return . Right , you cheap bastard . Do you remember that girl , the one I took to LA ? - Magi ? - Yes , yes . The other day , she even licked my asshole . Sir , what are you talking about ? - This is men 's talk . - I don 't understand . He said he likes you a lot , Kei . Really ? That 's terrific , sir . Please continue hiring me . Don 't worry . The company likes you . I 'd like to work for him and have you photograph me . Enough . We go home tomorrow . Sol suggest we party tonight . Say , does anybody know any tricks ? Tricks ? No . Tachikawa , how about some wrestling ? - Wrestling ? - Oh , boy ! Do it ! You want me to wrestle ? Show us your moves . Fix a bit . All right then . Who 's the opponent ? You can wrestle , Kazuyo . Me ? But sir ... Don 't worry . It 's fun . Come on , hurry . Get up . This is going to be great . But sir ... I don 't ... I 'm disgusted with you . You only care about your appearance . Back flip ! Well done ! You 're so stupid . Pile driver ! A splendid advertising business ? This is a nasty business ! Back breaker ! That 's enough . How can you work in a rotten business like this ? I loved him . You 're not independent . You don 't know the meaning of it ! You 're just trying to make the boss happy . They don 't care about our feelings . You don 't care either ! Okay ! You are champ ! Right , but you guys are pieces of shit . - What did you say ? - You 're the worst people on earth . Watch it , little boy ... Look who 's talking . - Everything you do is dirty ! - There is no moral in show business . Wanna go back to your mommy ? Little boy . People are begging for your job . What 's wrong with him ? He doesn 't understand life . He doesn 't know only bullies survive . Do you think he really left ? I want to go home too . He 'll be back after calming down . But he can 't behave that way . We 'll have to kick his ass . But he 'll take the car . He doesn 't have a license . He was probably drunk . Let 's not wait . Drink ? Who else ? Of course I enjoy making money . But I don 't want to take back what I 've said . I wish I could drive . Then I 'd leave them here . Kei , what do you want from life ? I really want to be script writer . Really ? Writers make good money . Maybe I could help you . I predict big things in your future . It 's all about the tone of the model and the color of the backdrop . I 'm sure you could do it , Rei . Next time we have a shot ... don 't forget what you learned . We have some events coming up . Would you like to be the model ? You could be a star . This is your chance . Believe me . I always reward my friends . That 's my style . Always fair . That 's howl am . It 's up to you . Let 's go outside . We 'll go to the other room . I wish I could take a bath . Body odor is a part of the truth of life . - You don 't have much pubic hair . - No . Stop it , sir . Why ? Because that model , isn 't she your girlfriend ? Kei ? No , she 's not . We 're just friends . I was trying to be her friend . Our work goes smoothly when we have good relationships . So ... this is what I do if I wanted a good job . In this world , there are different types of guys . Like , our boss , for instance , he won 't keep a promise . He 's nothing but a fast talker . But me , you can count on me . And I 'm the one who picks models . He doesn 't make decisions . I want to learn a lot from you . But sir ... He 's truly a sick man . I wanted to protect you from him . Sir . From now on , we 'll work together . I 'll make sure you work a lot . Artists always need fresh stimulation . - You make it sound like Dracula . - Yes , Dracula . We suck young girls just like Dracula . Sir . This is my first time . Then you are a lucky girl ! You 'll be glad you chose me . You will never forget this . Sir , stop . Let me take it off myself . Please , don 't look at me . Tell me , Kei . How was Asaoka ? I know you fucked him . Don 't . Be gentle . I bet he took your pictures ... while he fucked you , right ? He 's such a shallow guy . He does that to every girl . He should be more grateful to me . Who do you think made him successful like that ? Gotcha . Suck it , Kei . Pile driver ! Happy now ? Wow ... I feel good . I feel like I 'm gonna die ! Kei girl ! Kei girl , that 's enough fooling around . Come here . Come on , or you 'll lose your job . Tachikawa . Open the door ! Someone 's trying to kill me ! Asaoka ? Is it you ? Ouch , gentle ! Touch me . It 's big . Really big . It gives you more pleasure . Will it fit inside ? Sure . You 're ready . Let 's do it . You 'll like it . It 's you ! Go away . - Is this how you speak to me now ? - What are you talking about ? - Are you going to give her work ? - What am I supposed to do ? I 'll give you a recommendation for a new job . You 'll make good money . You 're so bad . You treated her cold . Will it happen to me too ? For us , this is the beginning . The beginning of a creative team . I have such a headache . Ouch ! Idiot ! Don 't move ! You 'll rip it . Here . Give it to me ! Give it to me ! It 's no fun . You 're soft . Let 's do it . Do it , do it ! Huge ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! More , more ! Oh , no ! This is 911 . Yes ? This is 911 . Repeat , 911 ... Go away ! Go away ! Don 't kill me . Why do you have to kill me ? Because I hate you . That 's it ? It hurts . I didn 't ask to be brought up in this world . It hurts ! It 's killing me ! Please don 't kill me . But I don 't wish I was dead . The life I chose ... was it a mistake ? A power strong enough to kill me ... until such a power comes I will live . Please don 't kill me . I want to live a normal life . I wonder if such a power exists in this world . This must be a dream . Let me wake up . What will come out of me ? I 'm afraid , but I 'm looking forward to it .

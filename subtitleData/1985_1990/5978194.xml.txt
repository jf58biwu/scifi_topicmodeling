 [ car honking ] Okay , Professor . We 're all set for the demonstration at Fort Henderson . I 've personally confirmed everything with the state department and the military personnel . Good boy , Jeff . I can always depend on you . [ crackling ] What happened ? Professor Gordon , are you okay ? Yes . Yes , yes , yes . I 'm alright , I 'm alright ! What are we gonna do , Professor ? All the information on your formula was stored in that computer . Now it 's been destroyed . Well , don 't worry . I 've got a duplicate disk of the formula stored away in a place that only I know about . I didn 't know you had a backup disk , Professor . What a break . Professor Gordon . What happened ? Somebody sabotaged the computer . Was anybody in here while Jeff and I were out ? She was . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] - Who is it ? - It 's just us , Natasha . Come in . [ sniffles ] Natasha , what are you doing ? Going back to the Soviet Union . I 'm will not stay where I 'm not wanted . Come on , what do you mean not wanted ? I want you . I-I , I-I mean .. Thanks , TJ . But the professor does not . The computer in the lab blew up yesterday . He thinks I did it . Come on , Natasha . You know that can 't be true . Yes , it is . He doesn 't like me nor trust me because I 'm a Russian . [ knocking ] I 'm Elena Borchek . Soviet Council . Give me five minutes , please . Oh , Natashok , Natashok . Everyone is so upset . You must reconsider . I thought you were my friend . I thought you cared about my feelings . I am , but you can 't just think about yourself . The Soviet and U.S. governments have gone through lot of trouble putting together this exchange program . 'Besides , I hand-picked you for this project . ' I don 't care . I want to go home . The professor does not want me here . Don 't worry about the professor . The U.S. State Department has contacted him already and he has apologized . I don 't want to be forced on him . He 'll only hate me more . I 'm sorry , Natasha . You have no choice . Were you , uh , were you gonna leave without saying goodbye ? I would 've written from Moscow . Well , I wouldn 't have answered . Liar . How do you say , " I love you " in Russian ? [ speaking in Russian ] Do we have to go to the concert tonight ? It 's music from the Balkans . I thought you were dying to go . I know , but .. ... I 'd rather be with you alone tonight . If this project didn 't mean so much to me I 'd tell ' em to stuff it . She 's too nice a person , Professor . I don 't believe she 'd do anthing- - They 've no right to make me keep her . Don 't let her out of your sight . Yes , sir . Good morning , Professor . Good morning , Jeff . Hi , Natasha . We have to get ready for the test demonstration . Jeff will tell you what to do . I don 't know what to tell you . He 's just in one of those moods . Oh , yeah , TJ . What happened ? You make me buy tickets to the Bulgarian music festival then you never show up . I got tied up . Lana , tell him how long we waited . What do you mean tied up ? Cool it , Clark . Can 't you see TJ 's blushing ? Blushing ? I 'm not blushing . This is , this is a sunburn . You know it 's really weird about Natasha . I mean , like , you know the Professor blaming her for that computer glitch . Well , they don 't call him " Uptight Gordon " for nothing . But you know , anything 's possible . What , you saying she did it ? She 's no criminal . TJ , we are covering a story on the professor 's formula . It is our job to think and to-to question things . Why only question things about Natasha ? How about the hundred others going in and out of that building ? Only three people had access to the lab . Only one 's not an American , right ? Whatever it is you have for Natasha has made you lose your objectivity . Yeah ? I think your prejudice has made you lose yours . Guys , guys , um , let 's lighten up here . I 'm just furious . Oh , that 's real good . That 's good . - I don 't believe him . - Clark , Clark . Just be a little bit more understanding . It 's the first time TJ 's ever had a girl he 's really liked . I know that . [ indistinct chattering ] Professor , can you tell me a little about your project ? Well , uh , I 've come close to developing a formula that improves the efficiency of gasoline and , uh , this is the first in a series of tests . Well , um , what would that do for the price of gas ? Uh , cut it by ninety percent . But the important thing is this . 'It would help solve our energy needs reduce the pollutions in our oceans and forests . That 's quite impressive , Professor . About the explosion in the lab yesterday do , do you have any idea what caused it ? Yes , it was an electrical short . Electrical short , huh ? You think there will be anymore student exchanges between the Unites States and The Soviet ? Let 's just say that I didn 't hand-pick the participants . 'Uh , this is a very sensitive project , you have to be careful and I don 't know this or any other Soviet student very well . Will you excuse me , please ? Hope I get a shot with his beady little eyes closed just like his mind and his heart . Like mine , TJ ? Ready . [ engine revving ] [ dramatic music ] [ explosion ] [ all clamoring ] Did you see that , Clark ? - Clark ? - What about Natasha ? Natasha ! [ siren wailing ] Professor . Are you alright ? Yes . Yes , I think I 'm alright . Thanks to you , Superboy . I 'm glad I could help , sir . Wait , wait a minute . - Professor , what went wrong ? - I don 't know . 'But you can be sure that I 'm going to find out . ' Is there anything I can do , Professor ? No ! Not a thing . Natasha . He hates me . I didn 't do anything to him . This is the container from which you poured your formula ? Yes . And I tested the contents . Somebody mixed ether into the formula . Result , explosion . Lieutenant Harris . Oh , you again , kid . That 's alright . They 're from the college paper . You 're sure only you three had access to the formula ? Positive . Lieutenant , I found this in one of the lockers . Any idea what this might be , Professor ? Ether . Where 'd you find this ? I found it in one of the lockers right over here . Whose locker is that ? Mine . [ phone ringing ] - Oh , come to see your friend ? - Yes , sir . - Too late . - Why ? She left with the Soviet Council . I knew they 'd have to let her go . No . We let her go on condition that she 'd be out of the country in three days . - Three days . - I 'm sorry , TJ . The only way we can get them to let her stay is if we can prove she 's innocent . Thought you were ninety percent sure she was guilty . You 've had a lot of wrong thoughts these last few days . I 'm sorry . I was really outta line . That 's history , huh ? So we all agree that only three people had access to the lab , right ? We 're in sync that Natasha 's innocent , right ? You and I are TJ , but what switched you ? I never said she was guilty . So that leaves two possibilities . That 's Jeff and the professor . The professor won 't sabotage his own project . You don 't know what his problems are or where they might lead him . Okay , Clark you take the professor , I 'll take Jeff . - Okay' - Oh , wait . What about me ? You be the message coordinator . Uh , we 'll call in about every thirty minutes . - Uh-huh . - Whoopee ! I can 't talk now . I 'll come over as soon as I can . Yes , don 't worry . Everything 's all set up . [ dramatic music ] [ knock on door ] Yeah . Excuse me , Professor . I don 't have time to talk to you now . Especially about that girl . I 'm not so sure she 's guilty . [ chuckling ] How dense can you be ? The janitor saw her in the lab after Jeff and I left . And the ether was found in her locker . Bear with me for one moment . Let 's , let 's-let 's say she really is innocent . No , no , no , no , no . I trust Jeff unequivocally . I wasn 't thinking of Jeff . Your subtlety astounds me . Why would I discredit my own formula ? I 'm just covering all the bases . If Superboy hadn 't saved me I would have been killed in that explosion . I 'm a physicist . I know the power of explosives . Will I be stupid enough to cause an explosion that might kill me ? I have work to do . - Thank you , Professor . - Mm-hmm . Lana ? Yeah , I-I 'm outside the Atwater Oil Company building . I 'm going in after Jeff . [ dramatic music ] The Atwater Oil Company . When did he call ? Um , just a few minutes ago . Alright , bye . The Atwater Oil Company . Professor Gordon 's formula .. ... it 's for gasoline . We 're almost home free , Mr. Drake . I 've got the professor thinking Natasha 's worse than Stalin himself . Well , I don 't give a damn what the professor thinks . All I care about is destroying that formula . Because if we don 't , it 's going to ruin my company and probably every other oil company in the world . Well , don 't worry . He 's only got one backup disk . [ door opens ] [ camera shutter clicks ] I 'm sorry . Am I in your way ? I don 't care about the shirt , but this camera . Really , guys .. What the- - He was taking pictures of the door . - His name 's TJ - Hey , Jeff . What a coincidence . He 's from the school newspaper . Always sticking his nose where it doesn 't belong . Look , I was just taking a few pictures . Yeah , of our door . Sorry , fellas . Didn 't realize the door is off-limits . Argh . You can take the film out of this and I 'll be on my way . You 're not going anywhere . Listen , I gotta get back at the lab . So it was you all the time , huh ? You set Natasha up ! Get out of here . Take care of your problem . And he 's mine . Okay . Send him home to mama . No , no . Via the shortcut . You 're not getting away with this . The state and the Russians won 't be too happy about this- - ( Drake ) Now ! Please , don 't do this , guys . Just a minute , please . Wait , save the camera . Oh , no . Wait . Would it mean anything if I said sorry ? No , no , you can 't .. [ screaming ] If I don 't thank you before , before I faint I-I want you to know you restored my faith in you . Take a few deep breaths and you 'll feel better . Come on . And you can show that I 'm innocent ? The professor 's the guilty one . The proof 's in the lab . Yeah . Jeff 's the one . He 's going back to the lab . Superboy 's after him and I 'm going there also . Jeff ? Professor . I 'm sorry , Natasha . My own stupid prejudice blinded me . Aw , very touching speech , professor . Come here . No . What are you doing ? Let her go ! Soon as you stop playing hardball . How about I blow away this pretty face ? Why are you doing this ? A million dollars , give or take a few thousand . And do I get the disk , Professor ? Or .. Alright , alright . In the lower drawer . There 's a false bottom . Press the knob on the right . [ grunts ] I 'm afraid you two have outlived your usefulness . Natasha . In case you 're wondering , Professor . I 'm setting the fire Natasha started . The poor thing dropped the formula while trying to escape . As usual the communist are inept at their task . Right , Professor ? So long , Professor . Thanks for everything . [ glass shattering ] [ gunshots ] TJ . My formula . In his pocket . I 'm sure he 'll be more than happy to incriminate his friends at Atwater Oil in exchange for a lighter sentence . - If the deal 's right . - Just get him out of here . But why do you have to go ? I mean you were proven innocent . The professor has been asked to continue his studies in Russia and he asked me to assist him . - That is really great . - Congratulations . We 're gonna miss you . - Goodbye , Natasha . - Bye . See you , guys . Well , I 'm not gonna miss you . Liar . I got a billion pictures of you . I guess I 'll be surrounded by you forever . TJ . I 'll never forget you . Never . Never , never , never . [ speaking in Russian ] ( TJ ) I 'll be seeing you . [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

Can I help you ? - Are you James Ferguson ? - Yes , who are you ? May I be so bald ... as to inquire if you are all right ? I 'm fine , why ? Did nothing strange happen to you in the past few minutes ? Well , nothing except you . Hey , what do you want ? - May I come in ? - Not unless you can write a speech . I got a lot of work to do , I am sorry , but no . Do you have the ... correct time ? It 's 11.16 , exactly . 11.16 exactly ! Must be a mistake , it should have happened by now . I 'll tell you what : I 'm very busy and I don 't know what you 're talking about . So why don 't I just ... go , OK ? I 'm sorry to have troubled you , Mr. Ferguson . Good night . Weird-O ... Ladies and gentlemen , my name is Jim Ferguson ... and as president of " Celebrity Dinners " it gives me the greatest pleasure ... to welcome you here today and celebrate with us ... the unveiling of our first ever mind of TV Stardinner ! Lend a hand . I 'm in a bit of a pitch here , old man ! - Something very strange just happened to my plane . - No kiddin ' ? Hurry there , old , will you ? They 'll start to whizbang us in a moment . Let 's move . Damn it ! I lost the bloody camera . [ must ] get up tomorrow and do it again . Thanks for your help . Don 't think we 've been properly introduced . I 'm James Bigglesworth . My friends call me Biggles . Jim . Ferguson . " Celebrity Dinners . " Whaddayou say ... You 're an American ! I heard you chaps were coming over . Uniforms on the way , I suppose ? The Germans have a fix on us . Come on ! Wait a minute . Yes , it 's ridiculous . Hey , what the hell I 'm doing here ? ! What 's going on ? ! Hey , look at that ! Just take a look at that guy ! Hi ! - Morning , Judy . - Good morning . These need [ approval ] immediately . I know , I 'm sorry , I 'm late . - What happened to your head ? I bumped in the door , it 's nothing . Come on , are we ready for the dry run ? First , I 'd like to go in the final cost unit figures with you . And we have a slight problem with our tray lids . It 's ridiculous , we can 't let the buyers see this . - Look at that girl 's breasts ! - Jim . Jim , we need this cover art . It 's modern , it 's stylish , it 's sexy . It 's what young America 's all about today , tits and TV ... ! Maybe , Chuck - but it just isn 't us . - I 'll be with you in a second , Deb . - Okay . - Yeah , looks almost good enough to eat . - Looks fantastic . Type these , and let me have a quick look for the go . Thank you . - Jim , can I talk to you for a minute ? - Is that important , Chuck ? Hey ! Now , would I bother you with something that isn 't important ? Do you mind ? The girl on the package cover , She 's part of my campaign for a new product ... " Starlet Snacks . " Every cover is a photo of a gorgeous girl , feastfully posed in provocative position ! So we can advertise on the " Playboy Channel " ! So what do you think ? " Match a starlet tonight " - Can we talk about this in your office ? - Jim . When we gonna dump that mountain of shit ? Chuck 's got some good ideas , and as long as his uncle runs a bank who gives us our loan - he is married to us . Try to get along with him , OK ? Look , please try to control Chuck . Only for today I want everybody THERE , you know ? - OK , but I can 't do everything . - What do you mean ' You can 't do everything ' ? You gonna have to . Look , Jim , it 's a big day . So lighten up , OK ? Now you sure everything is ready for the lunch ? Debbie , please give me a moment with this man . Let me deal with that . It 'll just be a minute , I promise . I see you 've hurt your head . Did it happen last night ? - What is this , " 20 questions " ? - Did you knock your head on a burning plane ? - Why did you say that ? - Did you ... rescue the pilot ? - Who the hell are you ? - Then it did happen last night . You must tell me . It is important you tell exactly what happened . Commander Raymond . Air Intelligence . What , are you investigating me ? No , nothing like that . Go on , you must tell me . Okay . I was in my living room , trying to write a speech . The next thing I knew , I was in the middle of some big battle , somewhere . The Western front . 1917 . - How did you know that ? - Please go on . A plane crashed . It was an old bi-plane . I helped the pilot to get out . - You saved him , you saved Biggles ? - Biggles , that 's right . Please , continue . Well , there was a lot of shooting and bombing . The plane blew UP ! All of a sudden - back in my room somehow . This really sounds crazy , you know . - What about the camera ? - Camera ? - The camera on the aircraft . Did Biggles retrieve it ? Um ... no , the plane blew up before he could pull it loose . Now this is very awkward . Listen , Mr. Raymond , or whoever the hell you are : do you mind telling me what is going on here ? - Jim ? We got a glitch on the mashed potatoes . - Just a minute , Bill . Please . Something else will happen to you . You must come to London . - London ? Are you crazy ? ! - My address is on the card . Good day ... Mr. Ferguson . I want some spring in that set , huh ? - How 's the evening ? - OK so far . Fine from " National Market " just arrived . - Oh Gosh . Is my tie OK ? - Yes . - Is my head on ? - Yes . - Wish me luck . - You gonna need it . It 's Maxine Fine . Mrs. Fine ! Great to see you . Oh , you 're looking good . Thanks for coming . Oh , hello , Ferguson . So , um ... is this it ? Working it into the big time , eh ? - Think we got the product to do it . - Oh , we 'll see . What are you selling in here ? Silicone implants ? Oh , you mean the cover , that 's market research . Will replace with a new one , Not much nose ... Consumers want a lot of nose in the dinner . Certainly will work on that . - What the hell ? - Look , let me get you another dinner . No , it 's OK . At least somebody wanted to eat it . I 'm not so sure about the corn , though . It looks a little bit like , um ... dog puke ? You know your customers this . This is the finest dog puke they 've ever tasted . - You again ! - What the juice are you doing in my plane ? - I don 't know . You 're assigned to the wrong plane . This may be a one-way mission . What do you mean - " one-way " ? The Germans have a new weapon . One that caused me to crash . I 'm gonna try and take another photograph . They may try to use the weapon against us . Make yourself useful . There is a helmet in the cockpit . Biggles , I have to talk to you . Don 't talk . Look ! Look for what ? Get over gun ! Shoot back at him ! - The gun 's jammed ! - Then un-jam it ! I have to run from him . - What did they train you for ? - Cooking ! Hey , I did it ! He 's gone . Rote flame . I got the photograph ! - What 's wrong with the plane ? - Same as before ! They 're using the weapon ! I 'll try more altitude ! Hang on ... ! That did it ! Whatever it was , we are out of reach ! - Take over ! - Take over what ? The controls ! Just hold it steady . I 'll take over now ! Careful with the photo , mate ! - What happened to you ? - Look , I can 't explain it . - Please tell me what 's going on ! - You got to get away from me . Just stay away from me ! - Where are you going ? - To London ! - London ? Come in . I 've been expecting you , Mr. Ferguson . This is my lair , as I call it . It 's rather cozy , don 't you think ? Of course , when they raise the bridge , it gets a bit noisy . But that is not very often . Please , sit down . I 'll get some tea . Oh , forget the tea . You mind telling me what the hell is going on here ? I got a business to run . People relying on me . I do not know what the hell you 're up to , or why - but it has to stop ! Do you hear me , I want it to stop ! - Mr. Ferguson , please don 't shout . - Why do you stick me with this ? If I had to ' stick ' someone with this - as you so elegantly put it , I would not have picked you . Fighting for your country and your life is something you 've mercifully have never had to do . That 's there you 're wrong , but ... last escapade I was on , I was shot at by some black-hooded clown in a German bi-plane . - Von Stalhein . It had to be . - I want some answers . Now ! Please , Mr. Ferguson , sit down as a good chap , and I 'll tell you what I know . The man you met was James Bigglesworth . This is a photograph of him with his team . Algy , Bertie and Ginger . - What these guys are , a vaudeville act ? - Indeed not . They there four of the bravest men my privilege to know . We all owe a great deal of the freedom we now take for granted to men like them . Oh . So what 's this got to do with me ? You gave this card ... to Biggles . - How the hell did you get this ? - Biggles gave it to me . You see , I was his commanding officer on the Western Front . I just gave Biggles this card two nights ago . Do you mean that was 1917 ? Time travel is not unknown in history . There 's evidence that It happens more often than anyone suspects . - But why me ? - I don 't know about ' why ' , but only that it happens . - How can I keep on meeting Biggles then ? Oh , as to that ... I think Biggles is your time twin . Time ... twin ? Listen , you got anything stronger than tea ? It seems that for the moment your lives are inextricably interwoven . Do you think , maybe ... the reason has something to do with this ? How did you get this ? The second time I went back , Biggles and I were on a photo recon mission , and , um ... when I returned , I was holding that thing . - Did Biggles tell you , what the photograph is ? - Yes , some sort of secret weapon . Biggles seemed real concerned about it . I 'll have this photograph processed . Mr. Ferguson . The time has come for action . - What kind of action ? - I have prepared something for you . - What for ? - Your next trip back . This time I will send you to the battlefield properly equipped . - Listen , is there any way I can get out of this ? - I 'm afraid not . If the enemy has developed a weapon that allows him to break through the allied lines ... then Germany could well win the First World War . History would be altered , and you will be stuck in ... 1917 , a sort of " time orphan " , I suppose . God knows what would happen to the rest of us . - This is getting crazier , you know . - You must not fail . I have arranged for you to stay at the hotel , just across the river . The Tower Hotel . And I will have this plate processed and contact you when it 's done . Good luck . You 'll be in good hands . Biggles is a fine officer . I - I really don 't understand what made him act like that . Psychosis trauma . It says so right here . - " Diseases of the mind " ? - I 've been reading all night , and I 've found the answer . Psychosis . Trauma . Syndrome . Jim is not crazy - he is scared . This got something to do with that man who came to see him yesterday . I 'm afraid that 's some kind of blackmail or ... - Hello ! - It is Jim ! Where Ar you ? I 'm at the Tower Hotel . In London . Tell me what 's the news ? We 're in business . Maxine Fine made a big order . That 's great ! I 'm coming home in a few days . - What 's going on ? - It 's personal , honey . I mean , I can handle it . - Look , I can be on the next plane . - Debbie , listen to me - NO WAY ! Absolutely not . I 'll be home in a few days . I promise you . Just say hi to the gang for me . You see , guys like Jim , pushy over-achievers , they store up stress ... and it builds up , and builds inside them , until they just ... snap ! - I 'm going to London . - I 'm coming with you . - Me , too . - No , Bill , somebody got to stay here and handle the orders . Just don 't you go there alone . I 'll take Chuck . Jim is as good as cured . Keep a tidy asshole . Excuse me , sir , um ... I did not see you there . I 'll come back later . - Êtes-vous Jésus-Christ ? - Biggles ? Where is he ? He 's got to be here . Biggles ! Does that ring a bell ? - Qui êtes-vous ? Êtes-vous belge ? - Not Belgian , Jim Ferguson . - Oh , an American . - You 're Bertie , right ? Algy . Ginger . Not so good on faces , but monocles I never forget . - How did you get here ? - You wouldn 't believe it . Try us . - I fell through a hole in time . - Oh , you can do better than that . - It 's the truth ! - You have three seconds . One ... two ... - OK ! I 'm an American secret agent . - What 's your identification ? You do not want to see it . Come on , you know - we do not carry ID ! - Why are you wearing a towel ? - Because I was taking a bath . Release him . - What have you done with my photo plate ? - It 's being developed . For now my orders are to help you , guys . Any way I can . We are ten miles behind enemy lines . We 're here to meet somebody who has information about the German weapon . Could you start by getting me some clothes , please ? It is freezing in here . - Do you know each other ? - Oh yes . We 've met . - Marie ! - Who is Marie ? She 's a girl Biggles met back in 1916 . Seems she was a German agent . Trying to trick Biggles and carrying messages over the lines . She fell in love with him , though . And double-crossed her own side to save his neck . Now both sides want her for the firing squad . Don 't worry . Biggles won 't be taken in twice . I have a map of them caves that lead to Blanche Fleur , It was where that they discovered the bodies . - Do you know what it is in Blanche Fleur ? - Nobody has seen it . Only what it does . Here is the map . You could not trust me , James . You must believe me . I 'm not working for either side any longer . Don 't become a nun . Yet . I haven 't ... yet . When this is over , I 'll come back to you , I promise . You must hurry . Germans everywhere ! They got us trapped . Came from all sides . - They must have had the whole place under surveillance . - We 've been betrayed . - We can 't make a in here . - Not with these people . Captain Eric Von Stalhein . The famous Biggles . At last we meet . Face to face . - Haven 't you forgotten your iron mask ? - I do not need armor to catch a spy . But perhaps you came to this nunnery to take holy orders ? Nothing like that , old chap . I just sing in the quire . Quire practices canceled today . Just out of ... curiosity . How did you know I was here ? One of our patrols spotted your plane , landing before daybreak . When they told me ... an English plane had made a night landing and taxied across a narrow bridge ... I knew ! ... it could only be the Great Biggles . To the Gods of war . To peace . I would rather finished you myself - in the air ! The firing squad will not be nearly as enjoyable ... ! But far less likely to butch the job . RAUS ! GRENADE ! Tell them not to move ! Or you 'll be the first to sprout wings . I 'm not gonna put a bullet in your head , old boy , ' cause that 's not the way we do business . Merci , sister ! Jim , it is Debbie ! Are you alright ? - Jim ! - What are you doing here ? - Can I come in ? - Can you wait a minute ? He 's become a religious transvestite . - What are you wearing that dress and hat for ? - I told you it was personal . Vow ! Transvestite-bankrobber . That 's not even in a book . Now , listen , both of you . There is a very good explanation for all of this . I sure hope so . This is Dr. Charles Winthrop Dinsmore in the lobby . I am a psychiatrist from New York city . One of my patients is staying with you , and ... I 'm afraid I need a little help with him . If you could arrange an ambulance , I 'd be most grateful . He 's in room 1231 . Oh , and a couple of good , strong tendants , too . - Is your patient dangerous ? - Of course not ! He 's just a little confused . He 's wearing a nun 's dress and has a gun ... - Did you say " a gun " ? - Yeah , just a ... normal ... big gun . - Jim , won 't you please tell me , what 's going on ? - OK , Debbie , but I 'm telling you - no one ever believes it . I keep falling through this hole in time . Going back to 1917 . Go on . - You believe me ? - If you say so , Jim , I guess I believe you ... Debbie - I keep going back to World War One ... where I 'm helping this guy named Biggles to find and destroy a German secret weapon . Come on . I 'm Dr. Dinsmore . Ah yes , sir . The , um ... doorman has a parcel for you . Jim , listen , please . I 'm not saying I don 't believe you about going back into the past and everything . But will you promise me one thing ? - What ? - Will you try to get some help ? Yeah , that 's what we going to Tower Bridge for . Would you cut the bridge story , I mean real help - psychiatric help . - You just said you believed me ! - Look , I 'm sure all of this is very real to you . Oh shit ... Come on , we have no much time . - I know nothing about a machine gun ! I never - Put him over here ! - Hey ! That 's him ! That 's him ! Debbie , stay away . You got to stay away ! Over here ! - My God ! Ferguson ! - It 's the American chap ! Captain Bigglesworth , this is Debbie Stephens , my ... nurse . You shouldn 't be here , miss Stevens . This is no place for a lady . The Huns will be over the top any second ! Stay close behind me ! - We can into the cave system , sir . - INCOMING ! Into the cave , quickly ! Jim , tell me this is a horrible dream , or maybe something you ! - Do you believe me now , I told you I keep going back to 1917 . - OK , but can we go back ? or forward ? Come on , Ferguson ! - Jim , this is all a big put-on , all this ? - Like " Fantasy Island " , right ? - Come on Debbie , it 's not that bad , it 's only WWI . Yo , Biggles , hold on a second here ! - You mind tell me the plan ? - We go through these caves to Blanche Fleur . The ones Marie gave me the map of . We got to find out what kind of weapon they have . This is the big offensive . I think that 'll only be a matter of hours before they use it . Good God , we gonna get buried alive ! Ah ! I know , this is some kind of hallucination . And this got to be ... these mushrooms I ate on the plane . Algy , that 's too many " Celebrity Dinners " for you . Stay close . Watch out for Huns . I suppose that Blanche Fleur can 't be far . Bertie , come with me . Ginger , you and Algy draw back and cover us . Jim , you and the ... nurse - wait here . Get down . All clear , chaps ! This is it . We are in Blanche Fleur . Algy , Ginger , cover the back . - Looks like this town was nuked . - " Nuked " ? What 's that ? It 's American slang word , it means to ... over-react . - What 's that thing ? - Wouldn 't be surprised to see some Eskimos . Let 's take a look . Ceramic tile . Like on a Space Shuttle . What are you talking about ? What I 'm saying is that these tiles are made to withstand a lot of heat . They 're using that dummies as targets . They must be about to test the weapon . - What does that horn mean ? - That we shouldn 't be here . Get to the Igloo , quick ! Listen , she can fight . Captain Von Stalhein . For all that looks , sir , we 're going to be that dummies . I 'm an American citizen , you have no right to treat me this way ! Doesn 't anybody speak English ? ! Please somebody call the American Embassy . Two of us here are from the United States ! I can prove it . I have my passport . Somewhere in here ... Look , look - I have my passport , my driver 's license , my credit card ... In that case , I also have my MACE ! Watch out for Huns , chaps . They perfected a bloody sound weapon ... We 've seen enough . Let 's go ! You two - stay here , until we get them cleaned out . Ginger ! Now you understand I gotta see Colonel Raymond . I don 't care how you do it , but ditch the cops . Stop ! Or we 'll shoot ! Stand still or we 'll shoot ! Don 't move ! - Jesus ! Where 'd you come from ? - I have no idea . - It 's the hole in Time , it keeps happening to me . - What you call that ? - That 's a helicopter . - Where 're you trying to get to ? - Tower Bridge . - Mind if I borrow your ladder , sir ? - Certainly not . - It 's got just beyond comprehension ! - What happened to you ? I was in my plane . The Huns have overrun our trenches . I went up to try and locate the weapon . Well , in Tower Bridge there 's a man who 's got your air photographs . - All right man . I 'll take this . - Thank you . - It 's been a great sport ... Biggles ! Have I met you , sir ? I 'm ... William Raymond . Captain Raymond ... Good God ! How I 've missed you , old friend . I 'm sorry , I ... I did not recognize you . The years have taken their toll . It 's the four of us . Bertie , Algy , Ginger and me ! Exactly . It was taken when our unit received it 's first commendation , and I was very proud of all of you . That was only last month . Extraordinary ! - How did you get here ? - He materialized , saved my life . I would never 've believed it , if I hadn 't experienced it . So ... apparently the hole in time goes both ways . It opens when one of the alters is in mortal danger . Here is that photograph you need . I developed the photographic plate Ferguson left with me . Now the ... weapon is very well camouflaged . But I used computer enhancement to show it in more detail . - Com ... puter enhancement ? - Never mind of it . - I 've marked the position of the weapon for you . - Right . - Time we were off ! - There 's cops everywhere . - Anybody got an idea how we get out of here ? How will you get back ... to the past ? I find a way . Godspeed . To both of you . Do what I do ! What 're you gonna do ? What an ingenious contraption ! What are you doing ? You want to think of what you 're doing ! We got to get out of here before they see us ! Wait a minute ! You not seriously gonna try to fly this thing ! You do not know how ! If you can fly a Sopwith Camel , you can fly anything ! - THERE THEY ARE ! Clever ! The plane can be tilted to create an air-screw effect ! [ Damn ] ! The little propeller in the back serves to compensate ! Why don 't you get in ? Welcome aboard ! - Might take a little to get this under control ! - Well , that 's good ! We don 't have long ! - Try the autopilot ! - " Otopilot " ? What 's that ? This one ! All right , don 't try the autopilot ! - Don 't worry , Jim ! England ! - I think this might work ! I know ! Biggles ! The hole in time ! We just went through it ! Absolutely , Ferguson ! Let 's show the sausage Huns what this thing can do ! Bertie ! Algy ! Ginger ! On your feet ! It is you ! I could not believe my ears . when your plane crashed ... What on Earth is this thing ? A flying windmill ? I 'll explain later . Right now I need a dozen Cooper bombs , a Lewis gun , plenty of ammunition ... and a bit of luck . Well , at least we can guarantee the bombs and the gun . Ginger - get full battle kits for all of you . Machine guns and grenades . - Are we going up in your windmill ? Afraid not . I 'm gonna use it to attack the sound weapon . I want the three of you to go to the convent . Protect the civilians . The Huns may want to take their prizes . - We 'll change their minds , then . Let 's go ! - And ... look after Marie for me . Come on , lads ! Heads up ! do it ! You still with me , Ferguson ? Whadda you say ? " let 's kick some ass " . Old boy . Ferguson ! Look at the photograph Raymond gave you ! The weapon should be straight ahead ! I fly straight into the sound weapon . Turn that voice box up to full power . - Throw it out . - What ? - The microphone ! Throw it out onto the speaker ! - I 'm gonna fight sound with sound . - Sounds crazy ! Hang on , old sport . Pick her up ! Here goes the power base ! Bye-bye to secret weapon ... I say we " nuked " it , eh ? Hold tight . I have a promise to keep . Grenade ? Close to the civilians . Maybe they listen to reason ? I say ... would you chaps consider surrendering ? Stay down , sister ! We 're not finished yet . GET DOWN ! Throw me the gun ! Thanks for your help , Ferguson . I 'll take charge of this man . Special Air Intelligence business . Come with me . - Well , did you finish the job ? - Yeah , we finished it . - Good show . - Did Biggles make it through the war ? - Oh yes . Biggles and his team continued to serve his country for many years afterwards . - Is he still alive ? - Sadly , I don 't know . Their last mission was on the High Plateau , in New Guinea . So far no word has been received from him . - I just , you know , started getting to like him , too . - Ah , didn 't they do some consolation ? Look ... Will you , Deborah Stephens , have this man , James Ferguson to be thy wedded husband ... and live together according to God 's law , in the holy state of matrimony ... Will you love him , comfort him , honor and keep him , in sickness and in health ... forsaking all others , keeping thee only unto to him , so long as you both do live ? I will . The ring , please . Quick ! Untie us ! Get out of here before they start realizing your not a God , you 're just an American ! You know , you guys wouldn 't taste too bad with a little saffron . You think you guys were in hot water ! I was just getting married ! It 's a hell of a way to start the honeymoon ... - Hey Biggles , where are we going ? - Come on , Ferguson !

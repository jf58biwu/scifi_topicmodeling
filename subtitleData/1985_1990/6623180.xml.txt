 ... 4-0-2-3-1 on contact at 18 miles . 2 - speed 250 , mile radius 2-3-0 . Both sides ... We 've talked to the military . They 've escorted it down . There appears to be a potential ... It looked like a door was opening ... This is not a hoax . That is real out there . That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert three years ago today - the first view of the Newcomer ship upon its arrival . These Newcomers , we soon learned , were a genetically engineered race adapted for hard labor in almost any environmental condition . In effect , their ship was a slave ship , washed ashore on Earth with no way to return to where they came from . Now that attorneys have successfully lobbied for the Newcomers ' release from quarantine , what are the reactions among the communities ? Why us ? Why can 't they go to Russia ? I 'll drink to that . I 'll be going to school with 9 - or 10-year-olds . There goes my job future . I have to compete with - If a 10-year old is twice as smart , I 'll be working here . By far the strongest words of acceptance came from then-President Ronald Reagan . We 've come to a turning point ... a moment for hard decisions . If not us ... who ? And if not now ... when ? Hey , Henry , how you doin ' tonight ? . You working hard ? . Hey , you got your green card , buddy ? . Slagtown . I hate this place . Look at that geek . I hate it . Look at this crap . I wonder if their plumbing 's the same . Yeah , it is . What ? . Oh , man , get out of here . Ugh . I don 't trust ' em , that 's all . Good day . Take a hike , will you ? . Jesus Christ ! Why do they get wasted on sour milk ? . Why can 't it be Jack Daniel 's or Thunderbird ? . What 's wrong with that ? . Look at this - Fred Astaire and Ginger Slag . What the hell 's that ? . They call this a game . It 's a circle jerk . Cowboys and slags . Ha ha ha ! They make up shit . Beating each other to death . So are you going or not ? . How do I go ? . You put on your wash-and-wear suit , your clip-on bow tie , then you show up at the church . It 's simple . Me and Carol are going . Well , that 's nice . Hey , come on now . We 've known Kristin since ... well , since she was conceived . Ha ha ha haaa ! Remember ? . Up in that cabin at Big Bear ? . You and Edie were pounding so damn hard , we had plaster in our hair . Look , I - obviously , I want to go to Kristin 's wedding . You just bummed your ex-wife and her husband are paying for it . If Kristin got married where I could afford it , we 'd be in a bowling alley . Does that look suspicious ? . Whatever gave you that idea ? . We got a possible 211 in progress , Porter 's Mini market , corner of Virginia and Court . Requesting backup . Come on , forget that shit . Let 's go . Listen ... pay attention . You tell me what those ugly bastards are doing in there . Two gentlemen , long , black raincoats . Long , black raincoats . With long , black shotguns . Oh , that 's no good . It 's not very good at all . You got your vest ? . Of course . In the trunk of the car . I feel a lot better now . Well , my brother , I 'm going to get a better angle on that door . You watch your ass . You watch my ass . Shit . Freeze ! Hey , freeze ! Aah ! Tug ! Come on , get out of there ! I can 't ! So you mind ? . Tug ! Go ahead , I 'll cover you ! OK . Oh , shit ! Hey , what 's happenin ' ? . Hi there . How are you ? . You mind stepping out here ? . We got a bit of trouble . Tug . Oh ... oh , shit . Aaaah ! Yaah ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh ! Whoa , whoa . Whoa , whoa ! Take it easy . You OK ? . I 'm all right . I better call this in . Ow , my hand . Jesus . Are you all right ? . Oh ... God , I hate you . Get out of here ! I don 't need your god damn help ! Take it easy , will you ? . Except for the magazine , looks like a standard 12 gauge . It is . How come it went clean through the car ? . B.R.I. Sabot slugs . Tug might as well have been behind a rosebush . Pretty heavy stuff for knocking off a mini market . An identical round was used in the shooting of a newcomer named Hubely two days ago . How come - Francisco , she won 't budge . Hey , uh - Hey , listen , uh ... you think there 's a connection ? . Hey ! Up yours . Hello , Daddy ? Dad , are you there ? Will you pick up the phone ? I really need to talk to you . Why are you being so stubborn ? Can 't you forget about your hassles with Mom ? It 's my wedding . Come on , you got to be there . Listen , I already worked it out with Tug . Nothing will stop him from dragging you to that church on Sunday . It 's at 2 : 30 , and please don 't be late . I love you , Daddy . Ahh , I shouldn 't have said that . Now you 'll pull this tape out and save it , right ? Bye . This is the gas company . Your bill is past due , and - Yo , Matt . Matt . Oh , Matt . I 'm sorry , man . Matt . Yeah , thanks . I 'm sorry about that . What did you dig up ? . Jesus , Sykes , it hasn 't even been 10 hours yet . Me and Alterez are on it . Yeah ... that makes me real happy . You ever try to make a case in Slagtown ? . The list of Newcomer informants is as long as a list of Mexican war heroes . Hey ! Come on ! Half of ' em don 't even speak English . The other half ... only when it suits ' em . It 's gonna take some time . I know it 'll take time with you two . I 've got an announcement . You OK , Sykes ? . I 'll make this short . This is a directive from Chief Evener , acting on a mandate from the Federal Bureau of Newcomer Relations . " As of 9 : .00 this morning , one Newcomer uniformed officer has been promoted to detective . " And we 've got him , gentlemen . Volunteers for duty with the new detective should see me in my office . Otherwise , I will choose a volunteer myself . That 's all . What 's he going to do if he gets too many volunteers ? . How long 's this slag been on the force ? . A year max , right ? . I was in uniform eight years before I became detective . I 'm calling the union . You got it , babe . We 'll back you . No chance , man . Where the hell 's he going ? . Bob ? . Yeah , Sykes ? . Yeah , I 'd , uh ... like to volunteer for duty with the new , uh ... um ... you know . Uh ... look , Matt ... you don 't have to jump right back in . Why don 't you take a few days ? . I 'd like to stay on . All right . Detective Sergeant Sykes , Detective Francisco . We have met . Yeah , right . Victor Goldrup , Mayor 's office . Congratulations , gentlemen . You 're to have nothing to do with the investigation into Tuggle 's death . Leave that to Federchuk . Right . You ? . Yes , sir . There is a case I 'd like to take . A homicide . A Newcomer named Hubely . Granger and Pitts are already on it . They got a full caseload . I thought , what with , uh ... excuse me , Francisco here , first Newcomer plain clothes , with the body found in the Newcomer community , I thought ... Don 't tell me what to think . It 's exactly what we need for this early advancement program . Yes , sir . All right , all right . Good . We 'll work my hours . I do the driving , and you do the paperwork . Sergeant , I would like to thank you for what you are doing . Oh , wait ... wait . Let me get something straight in your head . Want cream and sugar ? . No , no , I want to get something straight in your head . We are not pals , we 're not taking moonlight walks together , and don 't call me Sergeant . Call me Sykes or Matt . I am Samuel . Would you like a doughnut ? . Change your mind ? . Sam Francisco ? . Ha ha ! No , I ain 't buying ' that . I 'm not buying that . I 'm not going to introduce you to people as Sam Francisco . I think I 'll call you ... George . George ? . OK . Oh , they hung one on you . I , uh ... I heard a lot of good ones before , like Humphrey Bogart , Harley Davidson . I guess the guys got a little punchy handing out names to a quarter million people . You weren 't towards the back of the line ? . Oh , no . My true name is Stangia Sorentzaah . Sorentzaah ? . Thank you . I 'll call you George . Which paper do you like ? . I find it difficult to drive and read . Wait a minute . I got you your cigarettes . Where did you get this ? . What is this stuff ? . What is this ? . Tell me , what is this ? . That is a car deodorizer . That 's mine . Anyway , what 's it bother you if we think your name 's funny , right ? . That is exactly so . It is like your name ... Sykes . To us it sounds just like si ikes , two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium . Shithead . Why don 't you go ahead ? . I 'll be right in . Hey , man . So what do you got for me ? . You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find , and this ... is it . What in the hell 's this ? . A.454 Casull . We 're talking twice the impact energy of a .44 Magnum hot load . Only holds five . Shells are too big for six in a cylinder . Hell , Matt , you only need one . No , two . Thanks . How long you been shootin ' ? . That is god damn pitiful ! What will you do in a shoot-out ? . Wave the scores of your written exams ? . Why 'd you do it ? . So what ? . Agree to work with me . You don 't like me . You have nothing but contempt , yet you 're my partner . My partner is dead because one of you bastards killed him , then crawled down some rat hole . You 're going to help me find that ugly slag son of a bitch , you understand me ? . That 's awfully pretty , huh ? . Bring my gun . Let 's talk Hubely here . His body was discovered three days ago in an alley off Central Avenue near downtown . With two slugs in his chest . Through the chest , rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts . Hey , nice signal , dickhead ! He was employed at the Consolidated Petrochemical Refinery . He was manager of a methane facility . He was involved in a real estate venture to develop low-cost housing for Newcomers . Newcomers . That 's terrific . Real pillar of the community . Was he ripped off ? . Pardon me ? . Um ... was he missing anything when they found him ? . Oh , property . Five . He had no wallet but was wearing a watch and two rings . Those guys last night at the mini mart , they made a half-assed stab at the money in the till . That 's not what they were there for . We got a couple executions on our hands . The murder at the mini mart 's not our case . I don 't want to break procedure . What 's wrong ? . Wrong ? . Nothing . What should be wrong ? . Nothing . What 's wrong with you ? . Up yours ! Um ... you do agree that there 's a good chance that these two shootings are related ? . Yes , quite possibly . Would you also be willing to accept the theory , George , that by examining the evidence of one case , we might shed a little light on the other ? . Does that sound unreasonable ? . Yes ... No , it is not unreasonable . Although it is not - I 'm so glad that 's settled . I think we 're really starting to click , George . Give me what you got . I 've been over all this this morning . You got nothing better to do . Yeah , right . Don 't push your luck . Anyway , according to the sheet , the guy you nailed outside by the car - he was one Martin Helder - white male , age 27 . The rap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction . The guy was on coke when you stopped his clock . Have you identified this one ? . So far , he 's a John Doe ... or a Sam Slag . There 's no fingerprints , so it could be tough . Lucky for you , you got him in both his hearts . I emptied a whole clip into him . Usually that just pisses them off . " It looks like the miner 's disease . " Hey . What 's going on ? . Nothing . Nothing ? . " Run blood tests and keep it between us . " Got an extra head shot . We 're about to start cutting . It 's really fascinating stuff . Yeah , I 'll bet . Let 's check their personal effects . What is this ? . What 's that ? . It 's a rubber . It 's a , um ... you know , a condom . Coney Island whitefish , you know . Um ... men , you know , human men ... they put them on their penises to protect from having babies , understand ? . Excuse me . You need this for anything ? . I got my own . She has her own . Here . See ? . You get the picture ? . And that fits ? . Yeah , it 's made of rubber . It stretches , right ? . And still it fits ? . What 's this stuff here ? . Oh , it 's a resin . Newcomers working near methane gases and oil refineries must paint it on to protect against sparks . How do you know that ? . They hired my people because methane fumes don 't harm us . My spouse 's brother is one . All right . So , um ... the slag they 're cutting into upstairs - he worked at a refinery , and Hubely - he worked at a refinery . I guess that possible connection is getting a hell of a lot more possible , wouldn 't you say that , George ? . I guess I should talk to the store owner 's wife . I should speak to the widow alone . All right . You talk to the widow alone . I 'll check out the refinery . Hey , uh , thanks , huh ? . What about this Hubely guy ? . Hubely was a damn good manager . The men really liked him . Apparently , one of them didn 't like him so much . Here . Give this a look . You think this guy did it ? . He could have been involved . You know him ? . I hate to admit it , but they all look alike . Wait a minute . You know who this looks like ? . No . James Anderson . He 's not in today . He took the afternoon off . I think you 'll find he took the rest of his life off . Is this where he worked ? . Yeah , right in there . Wait . There 's 35 % pure methane gas in there . I don 't know how these fellas do it . Yeah . Thanks , huh ? . Anything I can do . Appreciate it . " I need your help , Mrs. Porter . " " I will try . " " Can you identify these Newcomers ? " ' " No , but my son might . " Here 's on oldie but goodie from 1988 - the Four Tops with Indestructible . Welcome back , Ozzie and Harriet . Well ? . One second . We 're not even moving . Safety first . Bye ! You have to yell ? . Sorry . Did you learn anything ? . Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband 's death verywell . She identified one man . It was Warren Hubely . Well , all right . What about the other guy ? . She didn 't know , but she thought her son might . Did you talk to him ? . No , but she told me where I could find him . Good . Who 's this guy we got to go see ? . William Harcourt - a business associate of Hubely 's . Our guest speaker tonight has done so much in his community . He 's come quite far in the last few years - granted , not as far as he came in the years before reaching Los Angeles . - Ha ha ha ! - Ha ha ha ! As Mayor of this city , it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who has so readily made our city his home . Ladies and gentlemen , William Harcourt . I am particularly grateful ... because I actually had the gall to write in my notes - " Thank you all for a very warm reception . " Imagine how embarrassed I 'd been if it hadn 't been such a warm reception . Excuse me . Mr. William Harcourt ? . Yes . I 'm Detective Sergeant Sykes . This is Detective ... Francisco . L.A.PD. Sergeant . Detective . I wasn 't aware any Newcomers were detectives yet . I am the first , sir . Congratulations . This is my administrative assistant-Rudyard Kipling . Rudyard Kipling ? . No shit ? . Ha ha ha ! We need some information about ... a business associate of yours - Warren Hubely . Ah . Poor Warren . Tragic . Yeah , wasn 't it ? . I understand you were partners in some slag ... Newcomer real estate thing , huh ? . He and I and seven or eight others . William . Wouldn 't you rather ride with Louisa and me ? . Excellent idea . Do you know these officers ? . Detectives ... Sykes . Sykes and Francisco . How do you do ? . Pleasure . I think we really should be going . Feel free to call my office Monday morning . Congratulations again on your promotion , Detective . Thank you . Remember , you 're setting an example in our community . I shall be keeping an eye on you . He 's going to keep an eye on you . " Sykes was the one who chased us and killed Anderson . " " You 're lucky , he didn 't recognize you . " " What if he talks to Strader ? " ' " Mr. Strader 's change of heart is dangerous , find him . " I 've been going to Berlitz for years - 6.42 . Excuse me . Here . I got it . How long did it take you to learn English ? . Three months . Three months ? . We learn quickly . We adapt . It 's our strength - what we were bred for . My neighbor - she 's got this kid who 's got a Newcomer in the class . The kid 's 6 and in the 7th grade . Imagine that . Thanks a lot . To me , it 's , like , totally amazing . Yes , it is . Oh , my God . I got yours . What is that ? . What kind is that ? . This ? . Yeah . Beaver . What ? . Beaver . It 's tasty . Sure . Want some ? . Not on a bet . I tell my son - you don 't know until you try . You tell him that ? . Let me ask you something - Would it really put you out - I mean , badly - if you put it on the grill ? . Our bodies don 't assimilate nutrients if the food 's been cooked . You know , George , that 's very attractive . We 're going to talk to people , and you got fur in your teeth - very attractive . # Scarymonsters # # Super creeps # The store owner 's widow thought we 'd find her son here . Just stay behind me . Just pay attention . Let me handle it . Watch . Yo . # We 've been running # # Running scared # Yo ! Which one of you slags is Porter ? . Yo . Who wants to know ? . Who said that ? . At the end of the bar . Right . # She asked for my love # # And I gave her a dangerous mind # # Now she 's moving in the street ... # # You Porter ? . Are you Porter ? . No , Matthew . This is the one you want . All right , huh ? . Matthew . Hey , butt out . I told you I 'd handle it . But - Zip it . I 'll start with something easy , like is your name Porter ? . Screw you . Yeah . Well , that can 't be right . You don 't want to know . Come on . Your mother mates out of season . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! Don 't they teach you anything about us in cop school , little sloker ? . Hey , George . George ! Enough . That 's enough . " You smell like a human . " A cop . It fits you . " I 'm sorry about your father . " " Help us find his killers . We can talk outside . " You know this guy ? . When my people first arrived here , he and I were housed together . Your mother says Hubely and your father were involved with another Newcomer . You know this other guy ? . Yeah . Yeah ? . High-roller dude named Strader - Joshua Strader . He runs a club on the west side . What club ? . Encounters . I know that joint . Look , that 's all I know . You want any more , you ask somebody else . Yeah , right . He 's a pleasant guy . If I may make a suggestion . Yeah , what ? . We have different weak spots than you do . Next time , a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect I think you were looking for . I knew that . Look what he did to my flashlight . Look at this . Come on . Any progress ? . My arm 's getting tired . So far-zip . I understand you 've been resisting my offer . Mr. Strader , your sense of duty is noble , but ... no longer an issue , I 'm afraid . I will not make this offer again . I would like you to work for me , distributing Jabluka to our people . If you do , you will know wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine . " I won 't do it ! " " I can 't let the nightmare start again . " Such a pity to lose one 's life for an outmoded value . Mr. Quint ... I believe it 's time for our friend 's swimming lesson . It 's important to practice new skills - essential for your growth as a person . You ain 't gonna believe it , man . Sea water 's like battery acid to these guys . He won 't talk to those cops - the two who came to question you about Hubely . This is getting out of hand . I want you to deal with it ... immediately . We must learn to embrace the things we fear . # Please allow me to introduce myself # # I 'm a man of wealth and taste # # Been around for long , long years # # Stole many a man and sealed his fate # # I was around when Jesus Christ # # Had his moment of doubt and pain # # Made damn sure that Pilate # # Washed his hands and sealed his fate # Hey , darling ! # I 'm pleased to meet you # # Hope you guess my name # Whoa ! # What 's puzzling you is the nature # # Of my game # Wanna bag a woman .

You 're drooling . # What 's puzzling you is the nature of my game # # Cassandra , police department . This is sergeant Matthew Sykes , and I 'm - Shithead . Ha ha ha ! We 're looking for your boss-Strader . He 's not here . Why ask me ? . The hostess downstairs said you might know . She did , did she ? . She was wrong . Excuse me . I have to change . That 's good . We have no problem here . Uh , we 're not here doing an interview for a high school paper . This is a homicide investigation . And , uh ... if you don 't stop jerking around , we 'll play a little hardball . Oh ... hardball . Sounds interesting . You going to strike me ? . You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me . I have my own ropes . Does that come free , or you charge a little extra ? . You have me all wrong . I never charge money for something I myself find pleasurable . I am going out to the car . I will meet you there . I don 't know where Mr. Strader could be . He comes , and he goes . Why don 't you hang around for a while and let me entertain you ? . Hmm ... nice . It 's Matt , right ? . Yes , indeed . Tell me the truth . Have you ever mated with one of us ? . Uh ... no , unless I got drunk and somebody didn 't tell me . A virgin . Ahh ... I find that very arousing . You sure you haven 't ? . Uh ... there 's lots of things I haven 't done . That 's not real high on my list . Don 't take it personally . I 'm a bigot . Maybe you 're just a little afraid . Maybe you 're afraid of what might happen once the lights go out ? . Maybe more than you want to admit ? . Doesn 't that curiosity and that fear all swirling together turn you on ? . Think of it as ... broadening your horizons . Oh - Uh - I like my horizons rather narrow . Your voice is saying no , but your body 's saying yes . Yeah , well - Wait , whoa . Excuse me . My voice and the rest of me are saying I 'll be back in a couple hours , and you make sure that Strader 's here . Huh ? . George , you handle the women from now on . What do you mean ? . I mean you handle the women . " I know it 's midnight . " " Yes I 'm being careful . " " The human seems likable . " " We 'll be working late tonight , so don 't wait up . " I love you , too . Do you mind ? . No . Be my guest . Ahh . That hits the spot . She keeps you on a short leash , George . My wife ? . She worries about me . I know the routine . Your home is quite disordered . I thought when I walked in that you had been burglarized . Well , I appreciate your honesty , George . Here . Ignore the bitch on the left . That 's Edie . I call her Idi Amin . Heh heh . Uh ... that 's Kristin , my daughter . Picture 's a little old . She 's 20 now . Getting married , matter of fact , Sunday . Human children can be very beautiful . Getting married . Congratulations . You 're taking Sunday off , then ? . Uh ... no . I don 't know . Maybe not . I don 't think I 'm going to go . She doesn 't need her burnt-out father there . I 'll show you something . This is Susan , my wife . Oh , yeah . I remember when I picked you up . Not bad . This is Richard , my son , 4 years old . We named him after the former President Richard Nixon . Ahem . You , uh - You open to a little piece of advice ? . Me , uh , I 'd tell people I named him after the actor Richard Burton . Take my word for it . So then the doctor says , " If this is my thermometer , where is my pen ? " ' Ha ha ha ha ! You don 't think that 's funny ? . Look ... the guy says , " This , this is my - This is my - " You got to work with me , George . I get a laugh with this all the time . If the doctor has the thermometer in his hand , where is his pen , then ? . In the other man 's rectum . Yeah ! It 's sticking up his ass ! Heh heh . Correct . Yeah , that 's what makes the joke . It 's a surprise . Your mind fills in these little funny pictures . See , there 's a guy sitting with a pen up his ass , and , uh ... good luck , George . Tustack . I just think that 's really funny . Heh heh . Tell it to me again . I got another one . # Sittin ' on the dock of the bay # # Wastin ' time # There is so much our two peoples do not understand about each other . No shit , Sherlock . You only come from another planet ! You humans are very curious to us . You invite us to live among you in an atmosphere of equality that we 've never known . You give us ownership of our own lives , and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves . I hope you understand how unique you humans are , which is why it is all the more painful that so few of you seem capable of living up to the ideals you set . Don 't count me . I never had any ideals . George , you 're all right . I am going home . # Looks like nothin 's gonna change # Yep . You go home . # Everything still remains the same # Get some sleep . You better drive - too screwed up to walk . # Tell me true # What a wild man . # Yeah # # Sittin ' on the dock of the b - # # Dock of the b - # Ohh ! # Sittin ' on the dock of the b - # Yeah ! # On the dock of the b - # # Sittin ' on the dock of the b - # # Better be good news or money . Oh , George . What ? . Hold this . I feel very terrible . I 'm so milked-over . Where 'd you get this ? . A man ... a human ... was wiring it to your car . My car ? . She is going to divorce me . She can 't divorce you . You mate for life , right ? . She is very progressive . I am certain she is considering it . Hey , Matt . Does a guy named Strader mean anything to you ? . Yeah . Why ? . They found what 's left ofhim washed up on the beach at Zuma . Federchuk and Alterez are already on their way . Thanks , Michelle . Come on , let 's go . To the beach ? . Yeah , surf 's up . Come on . Please , I must get out here . Huh ? . Why ? . Stop the car ! We won 't go near the water . I beg you , stop this car . Please stop the car ! OK . George ! I 'm stopping . OK . All right ? . Go ahead , get out . It 's cool . I 'll be back in a minute . Thank you . That kid reported this first ? . Yeah , about 11 : 00 . 00 ? . Yeah . God damn . How do you know that 's Strader ? . We found his wallet in his jacket pocket . Joshua Strader , big as life . You got any idea how long he 's been dead ? . Your guess is as good as mine . Only thing holding him together is his clothes . Hey . Huh ? . How you doin on Tuggle 's case ? . Store owner 's son 's in a street gang , so we 're thinking maybe it 's gang-related . Good . Work on that for a few months . Look at your dildo partner ! He 's scared of the sand ! I 'd love to see you by a sea of hydrochloric acid . That 's cute . Ha ha ha ha ! That 's real cute . I know why he won 't come . He forgot his hip waders ! Lay off him , you asshole . At least I 'm a detective , not some outer-shit space thing . You know , you 're right . You are a real detective , an honest-to-God detective . Ah ! Here , detect these ! Ah ! What was that about ? . Nothing . You guys finish your postmortem on Strader yet ? . " The Blob " ? . They 're finishing up now . Is Mr. Bentner here ? . No . He went home early . He left something here for you . Here . Does this have something to do with the tests he ran ? . What kind of tests ? . A blood test on that alien you dropped the other day . Los Angeles steals the ball ! Did he find anything ? . Well , George ? . ... pass down the middle . It 's nothing . ... drives underneath and makes a slam dunk ! Hey ! Don 't give me that nothing shit ! It wasn 't nothing yesterday when you asked what 's-his-name to run that test , and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits ! It 's not nothing now ! Don 't lie to me ! You must leave me alone . No . I 'm sorry . I don 't leave you alone . You 're my partner . I don 't work that way . Huh ? . All right ? . Well ? . OK . No secrets , god damn it . That slag up there , he was on something . It wasn 't sour milk . Am I right , George ? . Tell me - Aah , shit ! Tell me now ! Now ! The drug is called Jabluka . It is a potent narcotic . How potent ? . More potent than any human drug you can imagine . The controllers regulated it . We would receive small amounts as a reward for our labor in the mines . You were on this shit ? . Yes ! We all were . We were genetically engineered as slave laborers . It was our only means of pleasure allowed ! The harder you worked , the more you got . The more you got , the harder you worked . Thousands of my people ... died . I lost my best friend . It is a nightmare . I will not let it happen again . Wh-Why wouldn 't you just tell me something like that ? . Your people cannot know about this part of our past . It would threaten our entire existence here . How did this guy get it ? . I don 't know how he got it . Was it on the ship ? . No . I mean this is , uh ... it 's major , George . It 's really major . It 's simple . All you had to do was tell me . Here 's Hubely . Looks like he passed up jobs , waiting for the one at the refinery . Would you punch up Joshua Strader for me ? . Released on November 29th . Came immediately to L.A. And took over a club called the Encounters . Now the store owner , please . Cecil Porter . Released December 1 . Field of expertise ... organic chemical engineering . Holy shit ! What we 're looking at here ... you got three Newcomers with nothing in common . What if it 's just one guy that shot the three of them ? . Now you got four Newcomers , totally different backgrounds ... George . Quarantine . Honey , uh ... punch up the occupants of Porter 's lodge number . OK . Porter was in 772 . Harcourt . Gin . Porter somehow created the formula . Hubely provided the manufacturing at the refinery . Strader 's nightclub was the distribution network . Harcourt wiped them all out so he could have all the marbles . He 's responsible for everything . I want his ass . He 's mine . We got to play this smart . The drug is here . We must destroy it . Hold it . You 're missing the point . The drug is our evidence . We need it . Hey ! That 's the guy right there . Are you crazy ? . Open the door ! So much for playing it smart . You can 't come in here like this ! Shut up ! Where 's the drug ? . What drug ? . This is an oil refinery ! Aagggh ! Where ? . You can 't do this ! Aagggh ! I think you 're crushing his little chest bones . Stay out of this . Right . Tell me where the drug has been taken , or I 'll crush your lungs . Hey , O 'Neal , don 't piss him off . I can 't control him . I saw him once pull out a guy 's spine and show it to him . I had to throw up , you know . They took the stuff out this afternoon ... all of it . Where did they take it ? . Aah ! The Encounters club . Quite lovely . What is your name again ? . Cassandra . I shall remember that . George , lighten up . Don 't sweat it . We got them by the short hairs . He ain 't gonna make any more of that shit ! Ifyou destroy the drugs , you 'll destroy the case . Please stick to procedure , OK ? . Fuck procedure . Hey , George - George ! God damn it ! # George Francisco # # Open your Golden Gate # # Open your gate and let me in # # You ! Hey , you ! Police ! Get out of there . What ? . Walk that line right now ! Come on ! What are you talking about ? . What about me ? . Senor , that 's my truck ! It 's been a long time ... hasn 't it , gentlemen ? . What is it ? . A sweet indulgence from our past , resurrected for our future . Feel free to sample the quality . I 'm sure the experience will be everything you remember it to be . Where did you get it ? . I spent time with three very resourceful men . Mmm ! Jesus , it tastes like detergent . That 's all the effect you 'll get . But when my fellow Newcomers learn they can obtain it here , they will work very hard to make as much money as they can to give it to me . Tell them the rest , Harcourt ! Tell them ! He 's got the C-4 charge . Put your guns on the table . Up against the wall except you ! Take it easy , buddy . Keep your finger on the button . You release that button , you 'll not only kill us but yourself . To get you and this , I would do it . That is not in any books as a controlled substance - legally , no different than 12 kilos of grape jelly . The charge is murder and conspiracy to commit murder . Hubely ... Porter ... Strader . You killed Strader ! No ! Aah ! Kill them both ! Here ? . So it ! Don 't shoot ! 4230 Hollywood Boulevard , Club Encounters . Yes . Shit , it worked . Turn back ! Get the car ! Let 's go ! I can 't ! You have the keys ! Turn the police light on . Pull it over ! Don 't put that in my face ! Man , get out - We lost them . Move ! Everybody move ! Move , will you ? . We 're the god damn police ! On your right . The god damned road is blocked ! Oh , Christ . Head straight for them . He 'll move . This is chickie , George . I never lose . Damn ! Uhh ! Ohh ! George . Anything broken ? . You all right ? . Don 't move . Put ' em up . I said put them up . Hey ... you move one finger , and you 're history . Not history ! Eternity ! Aagggh ! I just remembered a joke that my son told me . Yeah ? . So ? . I - I-I better not tell it now . I 'd-I 'd-I 'd - I never - I don 't tell jokes well . No , probably not , but go ahead , tell me . If I-if I - if I begin to tell it and you know the joke , please say that . Why did the chicken cross the road ? . I know it . It 's-It 's a funny joke . I assume with Harcourt and Kipling dead , you will be requesting a reassignment now . Well ... just for your own good . I think you 'd be better with a partner who 's , you know , more by the book . But still , George , I got to tell you , for a quiet guy , once you get started , you 're hell on wheels . I hate missing your next few days as detective . Guys , I 'll take you to the station . Come on , partner . They 're waiting to take your statement on the shooting . I didn 't shoot . He OS 'd . You got a match ? . Yeah , in there . Aah ! What 's this about , Sarge ? . Just keep driving , all right ? . Just drive . What the heck is that ? . Holy ... I 'm calling for backup . No . Leave it be , will you ? . Sarge . Something gutted them . I 'm going to request help and an air unit . What-What - What is this ? . It 's Harcourt . He 's dead . No , he 's not - not if he overdosed on the drug . Massive amounts trigger a change . You appear dead , but it 's a state of incubation . When you emerge , you are metamorphasized . We must not let him get away . What ? . What would happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming ? . Got him ! Wiltey , no ! Argh ! Aah ! Ah ! Hey , you ! Get the hell off my boat . You heard me . Get off the boat ! Over there ! Argh ! Nice view , huh , you dumb sack of shit ! Let 's have a cold one ! Aah ! Take her down ! Sown ! Take it down ! Aah ! Aah ! Your scarf ! . Can I borrow your scarf ? . Take her down ! Aargh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Uh ! Wait ... wait ... wait . What the hell was that ? . It looked really weird ! What do you mean weird ? . Looked like every other slag , just plain ugly . Hey , look at this ! Go ahead . Wait . Let me hold the tie . Ah ! Sorry . Everybody gets dressed , right before their daughter gets married . There you go . It looks all right ? . Good . Ready , Daddy ? . All set ? . Yes , honey . Uh , George , uh , I just want to ... I 'm going to apologize for the rotten things I 'm going to do and say to you over the years . It 's all right , Matthew . After all , you 're only human . What a wild man . My daughter 's got a husband , I got a partner . He ain 't really half bad , except when he 's got that rotten milk on his breath . # We are friends # # We are brothers # # Always there looking out for each other # # I n a world where so many dreams # # Are broken apart # # Yeah , but # # When the world tries to beat us # # We hang tough # # Ain 't no way they 'll defeat us # # ' Cause you and I will always survive # # Together we 're strong # # Heart to heart # # Any storm we can weather # # You and I # # We 've become united forever # # Two hearts that can beat as one # # There ain 't a single thing we can 't overcome # # We 're indestructible # # Indestructible # # We got the power of love # # So strong We can generate # # A wall of solid love nothing can penetrate # # We 're indestructible # # Whoa , ohh # # There 's a power # # Deep inside us Deep inside us # # Ain 't no wall that could ever divide us # # ' Cause we won 't fall We 'll show ' em all # # Just what we 're made of # # You and I # # We 're in it together # # We stand strong # # Through it all united forever # # Two hearts that can beat as one # # There ain 't a single thing we can 't overcome # # We 're indestructible # # Indestructible # # We got the power of love Ooh , ooh # # So strong We can generate # # A wall of solid love nothing can penetrate # # We 're indestructible # # Whoa , ohh # # Heart to heart # # Any storm we can weather # # You and I # # We 've become united forever # # Two hearts that can beat as one # # There ain 't a single thing we can 't overcome # # We 're indestructible # # Indestructible # # We 've got the power of love # # So strong We can generate # # A wall of solid love nothing can penetrate # # We 're indestructible # # Whoa , ooh # # Indestructible Our world # # Indestructible We 're indestructible ... # #

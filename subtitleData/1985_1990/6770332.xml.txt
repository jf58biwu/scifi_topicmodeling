 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello , this is Judge Kaiser . I 'm unable to come to the phone right now . Please leave a message when you hear the tone ... and I 'll call you back as soon as possible . Jules , this is Marsha . We missed you at the Mayor 's reception this evening . I called your house and there was no answer . I 'm at least glad to know you 're not working late again . You drive yourself so hard , it 's absolutely terrible for your health . Don 't forget , Doug and I are taking you to the Bolshoi on Saturday . Don 't worry about calling . Bye . I got it , I got Space Lab . Let me see . Look at it ! They 're gonna test the communications laser in three minutes . Come on , a toast . A real space station , incredible . Seems like they just put a man on the moon . You must be proud , too , a Newcomer astronaut . Yeah . Must be having a trip up there . I 'm just like every kid in America . We all want to be astronauts . " To boldly go where no man has gone before . " You 're cold . You should 've brought a jacket . Cathy . I don 't feel like a human woman , do I ? No , not really , but that 's okay . So , you liked it ? Did you ? I think so . I feel ... They 're gonna test that laser . Right . I think about her in a sexual way three , four times a day . Cathy 's not a barnyard animal . It 's legal , Sikes . But she 's not human . And you are ? Are we supposed to drink this or eat it ? Come on . No , I mean it . You work with them every day , you forget . But you try and get close , real close , you realize they 're different . They 're not like us . You sound just like my dad when I was dating Harris Weinstein . Forget it , forget I said anything . Listen , Sikes , you 're worried about being normal , okay . This is a simple thing , date a human . Get your mind off the alien . You know , this reminds me exactly of my cousin Raphael . He was so worried about being gay . I gave him the same advice , I said , " Get yourself a nice girl . " Yeah , and ? He 's living with a guy named Steve . Hey , he 's happy . I hope they didn 't notice , I had flies . What ? In my stomach . I was nervous . Butterflies . About what ? I just had my oral exam for Detective Two . I don 't think I did very well . No sweat . I took that test . Lorraine Clark , please . Matt , you flunked that test . Like I said , no sweat . Lorraine , hi . It 's Matt . Listen , I was wondering if tomorrow night ... would you like to go out to a movie , a dinner ? Great . Someplace greasy and carcinogenic . I 'm always up for ribs . Wunderbar . I 'll pick you up at 7 : 00 . Bye . Matt ? Did you make a date with Lorraine ? What about Cathy ? Does this concern you ? I thought you cared for Cathy . Yeah , but we don 't have any kind of agreement or anything . Besides , don 't you think it 's normal for me to want to go out ... with a human once in a while ? I don 't know . It 's just that ... I got a date . And a case . Judge Kaiser 's clerk found him this morning . I 'd estimate the time of death between 10 : 00 , 12 : 00 last night . What killed him ? I 'm not sure . The discoloration could indicate asphyxiation or coronary infarctions . Could it 've been from an illness , some kind of natural cause ? No . There is nothing natural that would do this to a Newcomer . We 're considering it a possible homicide . I 'll have a much better idea after I run some toxicological tests . Did you get anything ? Clerk told me that Judge Kaiser received some threatening letters . He said that he 'd ruled in favor of Newcomers ... in a number of civil rights cases . Get back to the clerk , we 'll need those letters . And get a subpoena working on his files . We should talk to everybody he ruled against the last couple of years . You 're both detectives , how come he gives the orders ? I don 't think he was ordering me . Hey , George . What are these ? Kaif balls . Tencto-nip . Tencto-nip ? We rub them between our hands and smell the fragrance . It has an endorphin-like effect on Newcomers . Oh , yeah . Yes , it 's soothing , it 's like your catnip . Not my catnip , cats use catnip . You don 't know what you 're missing . I like these designer colors . Whatever , bag it . I was at the faculty meeting . Mr. Fisher presented the new reading lists . Due to parental pressure ... the department will now no longer be teaching Salinger , Flaubert , Camus ... Camus ? You mean we 're not gonna be reading I ' etranger ? Not in school . I love that book . You know what 's required reading in history right now ? My Turn by Nancy Reagan . Out of school , your time 's your own . I would be very happy ... to get together informally and read and discuss any book you want . Great . When can we get together ? Let 's just keep the book short , okay ? Okay . How about day after tomorrow ? Sounds good , I 'll be there . Buck , I wanted to tell you , your essay on Whitman ... as the zeitgeist for post-Civil War America , that was very well thought out . Very sophisticated . Thanks . I know mine 's late , but my hard disk crashed . So I 'm gonna have to get it to you tomorrow . But it 's about the Alamo . I shall look forward to reading that , Noah . Can we start with Flaubert ? I hear Madame Bovary is great . That 's my favorite book , yes , we can . Hey , Zepeda . What 's happening ? Hey , Sikes . Grazer assigned me and Petrosian to assist on this Kaiser case . I called in some potential suspects to give statements . Okay . Is George around ? He 's gonna be late , he had to see the Commissioner . Commissioner ? Is he in trouble ? The best kind . He made Detective Two . He passed the test ? Yeah . He 's your boss . Zep , how did George pass the test ? I didn 't pass the test . Maybe he knew more than you . That 's Dr. Paul Matus . He 's a slumlord in Little Tencton . Judge Kaiser sentenced him to live in his own building for six months . I 've been a detective for five years . Walked the beat for ten . I came here like you wanted . I need to wash my hands . Michael Bukowski , Judge Kaiser threw the book at him ... when he took a shot at a Newcomer delivery man . He just got out of jail . I need to wash my hands , he won 't let me wash my hands . Soon as you give your statement . I didn 't know who he was . How do I know he wasn 't a thief ? Yeah . Sure . George has only been a detective for a year . Hell , he 's only been on this planet for six . That 's Darlene Bryant , a member of the Human Defense League , a Purist group . They mounted an unsuccessful campaign to get Judge Kaiser off the bench . Officer , I have been waiting here for over 45 minutes . I 'd like to leave my written statement and go . We 'll get to you as soon as possible , Miss Bryant . Listen , I realize that this is your job ... but doesn 't it bother you , that with all the crime in this city ... you have to waste your time with the death of this parasite ? What bothers me , Miss Bryant , is having to listen to crap like that . Excuse me . Hey , George , congratulations on Detective Two . Thank you , Matt . I guess I had no reason to be nervous . George , I just heard . Isn 't it wonderful ? He 's only been on the Earth for six years , and already he 's Detective Two . Could be Captain someday . He could be mayor . Albert ... Detective Two . I 'm gonna go tell everybody . Matt , I want you to know that although technically I am now your superior ... I still consider us equals . Well , thanks , George . Among these threatening letters Judge Kaiser received ... these were anonymous . Run them upstairs to SID , would you ? Me ? Is there a problem ? I 'll ask someone else . George , congratulations . Thank you . Sikes , there is one suspect that wouldn 't come in . I think Petrosian and I should go question him . Why ? He lives on a boat . You know , salt water . As your George Patton once said : " I couldn 't ask anyone under me to do something I wouldn 't do . " Thank you , Beatrice . George , salt water . You fall in , it 's sayonara , Detective Two . I 'd better do it . I don 't intend to fall in . I tell you , George , I love the smell of sea air . How can you possibly find this stench pleasant ? I can hardly breathe . Excuse me , Mr. Parris ? Police . How far do I have to go to get away from you creatures ? Mind if we come aboard ? Permission granted . Watch your step . Mr. Parris , Judge Jules Kaiser died yesterday . I won 't pretend that I 'm sorry . You worked for Onyx Pesticides as a chemist . You later brought suit against that company and ... Judge Kaiser ruled against you . Listen to this , jazz . Jazz is a synthesis of Western and African musical forms . It 's a beautiful example of the process of human creativity . Makes you proud , doesn 't it ? Jazz has its roots in human slavery , does that make you proud as well ? Guys , may we skip music appreciation ? I sued Onyx for stealing my patent . The judge saw it differently . We understand you stood up in court and called the judge a , quote : " Blood-sucking Slag " and threatened to exterminate him . Insecticides are my business . I was angry . I used professional jargon . I 'm resigned to the loss . I lead a quiet life here on the sea ... enjoying the fruits of human genius . May I ? What 's the point ? It doesn 't come from a cow . '82 Mouton . You 're drinking it young . It 's still tannic , should be drinkable by the turn of the century . Wine doesn 't intoxicate us , but we can appreciate it . Hello , Dr. Bogg . This came while you were at work . Thank you , Martha . " From an admirer . " Let 's have a look , shall we ? What are those ? Kaif balls . Tencto-nip . Wonderful . Eclairs , napoleons . I love this cannoli . How do you think it 'll fit on top of the nachos and the gummy bears ? I think it 'll be a perfect finish to a lovely meal . Here , I got something to clear the palate . My hair 's a little messy . Do you have a mirror ? Yeah . The bathroom 's in there . Okay . And don 't cheat , I know how many are in there . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hi , Matt . Cathy . I know it 's late , but I just heard on the news ... they 're having another laser test on Space Lab . It 'll be visible in five minutes . No , I 'm kind of busy right now . I 'm sorry , I should 've called ... but I was already on my way up to the roof when I thought of you . Cathy , I thought I heard your voice . How are you ? I 'm fine , and you ? Great . Matt and I just saw Back to the Future V. Wasn 't very good . We 've got these really sinful desserts . You want to join us ? They contain cooked animal fat . I 'd probably go into reverse peristalsis . You 'd vomit ? Yeah , they 're kind of rich . I 'd better get up to the roof . Good night . Cathy , thanks for asking me . Next time , huh ? I will get these so shiny you 'll be able to see yourself . That 's very kind of you , Albert . Albert , how about a doughnut run ? I 'm sorry , Sergeant Sikes . I have to polish these for George . What 's going on here ? Albert wanted to polish my shoes . He said a man in my position should have shiny shoes . Excuse me , Albert works for this precinct . He 's not your butler . And is he your doughnut fetcher ? What the hell is this ? " Detective Two Francisco " ? What , you got to advertise ? Susan gave me that . She said , " If you got it , flaunt it . " You mean , shove it in their face . Matt , tell me , do you resent my having passed the test ? Heavens , no . I just think maybe there ought to be different criteria for you guys . That 's all . Just because you guys got a hard disk up here ... doesn 't mean you know everything . Here 's the work-up on Judge Kaiser . We are looking at a homicide . He was poisoned biologically with a bacterium . It resulted in constricted airways and asphyxiation . What causes that ? Something new , genetically engineered . It seems to affect Newcomers like botulism does humans . It produces a toxin , which is fatal within 36 hours after introduction . Are you saying someone has created a bacterium to kill Newcomers ? I 'm afraid so . What about George ? He was there . You don 't need to worry . The bacterium doesn 't seem to be contagious ... and after six to eight hours , it doesn 't live outside of a host . How did Judge Kaiser ingest it ? Through the lungs . He aspirated a large concentration of the bacterium . Bad news . We 've got another Newcomer corpse . Symptoms look just like Judge Kaiser 's . George , I don 't think you ought to be in here . You heard Lois , the bacterium is not contagious . Besides , I 'm protected . We don 't know what we 're dealing with here . Matt , as Detective Two , it 's incumbent upon me to spearhead this investigation . Here 's the maid . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . I 'm Detective Francisco , I 'm in charge of this investigation . Poor Dr. Bogg , he was such a lovely man and so brilliant . When was the last time you saw him alive ? Yesterday . I was off this morning , and when I got here ... he was already dead . Hey , George . Same as Kaiser . Those came for him in a package yesterday . " From an admirer . " Bag these , carefully . They may be the murder weapon . For all Emma 's silliness , her bourgeois values ... she 's ultimately a sympathetic character . A victim of her own society . Yeah . Like everyone else , she was never truly satisfied with what she had . Right . Her sense of worth comes only from material possessions ... or social status , not from anything internal . But you really understood her . Flaubert 's writing is so good . I read it over in French and the imagery is even stronger . Noah , what were your thoughts ? I haven 't read that much , but so far it 's kind of boring . Nothing 's happening . That 's what 's great . I mean , the detail of Emma 's awful everyday life ... contrasting with her dreams . Well , you read so fast , of course it doesn 't bore you . " I read it over in French . " Come on , I think it 's wonderful Buck wanted to read it in the original . What am I doing this for ? Who needs it ? Noah . No , I get enough in school . I can 't get her to stop crying . Let me take a look at her . Her droonal flanges are coming in , it 's painful . George , you 've got the magic touch with her , would you ? Come on , little spotty head . My goodness , what is this awful sound coming from you ? ( SINGING A LULLABY IN TENCTONESE ) Emily , would you get that ? Thank you . Hi . Hi , Emily . Beatrice . George , we need you down at the station . We got a letter claiming responsibility ... for both Judge Kaiser and Dr. Bogg 's murders . Emily , would you please take little Vessna upstairs ? Why can 't I hear ? It 's gonna be on the news , anyway . The letter is from an organization calling itself the National Purist Front . Nobody 's ever heard of it . But this so-called NPF says it 's gonna continue to execute ... prominent Newcomers . I 'll try not to be too long . George , you 're just as prominent as any Newcomer . Chief Amburgey 's ordered protection for all Newcomer civil servants above D-6 ... and their families . So , Officer Dial will be posted outside . Don 't worry , we will catch them . You 're here early . Didn 't you know that Detective Two 's get to sleep in . I 'm waiting for an analysis from SID On what ? You heard of that letter from the National Purist Front . Thank you . Yeah , Zepeda told me this morning . I 'm having SID run some tests ... comparing it to the threatening letters Judge Kaiser received . That 's inspirational , George . Why didn 't you let me know ? I am letting you know . I mean , before now , partner . There 's nothing to get worked out about . I didn 't want to wake you . Detective Francisco . " Detective Francisco . " I see . Thank you , Lois . That was the medical examiner . How come she calls you ? She confirmed our suspicion . The kaif balls were dosed . By sniffing them , the victims aspirated the bacteria . Someone remembered me . Sikes . Cathy . From SID Tonight ? Yeah , I 'd like that . Okay , bye . Just like my cousin Raphael . Matt , this letter from this ... National Purist Front was printed on the same computer paper ... by the same printer as one received by Judge Kaiser . The first letter was signed . We have a suspect , a Mr. Michael Bukowski . Yeah . He was in here . What a wacko . Bukowski works maintenance in Gretsky Park . Let 's pick him up . Bukowski . What are you doing ? Hey , come back ! Get out of the car . No , get in the car . Get out . I 'll drive . Matt , get in the car . I don 't believe you , George . George , will you cut him off ? George , what are you doing ? Wait . You did this just to lord it over me , now you 've lost him . We 'll see . Terrific . You probably killed him . Did not . He 's breathing . Lost him , have I ? You 're under arrest . You know your rights ? Don 't worry . Detective Two will explain them to you . I didn 't kill them . I didn 't kill anybody . You wrote this letter threatening Judge Kaiser . I know . I know I did . Then you wrote a letter claiming responsibility ... for the deaths of both Judge Kaiser and Dr. Bogg . He 's trying to look me in eye . Would you tell him not to look me in the eye ? Hey . What about the second letter ? I had to do something . But it wasn 't real . I was just trying to scare people . You mean Newcomers . I saw on the news about those guys dying . It gave me the idea . This organization of yours , The National Purist Front ... who else is in it ? Nobody . There is no Purist Front . I made it up . If you 're innocent , why did you run from us ? You know why . I was afraid of him . See , I know what they 're trying to do . And they know that I know . And just what is that ? They 're trying to take over . They 're trying to control us . Trying to make us their slaves . You see , they got these eyes and they 're like radar beams . And they can get into your brain ... and they can make you do what they want . Don 't ever look them in the eye . Right . Put him some place with soft walls . He 's clearly a paranoid schizophrenic . I don 't know . I thought he made a few good points . That stuff about you guys wanting to take over . This isn 't funny , Matthew . Who 's laughing ? By the way , where did you learn to drive ? The kamikaze school ? No , Sears . I didn 't quite finish the course . Never mind . You know what 's really bothering you ? What 's really bothering you is that I 'm no longer the nice little Slag you can order around . That 's a load of crap . You think I 'm uppity . Uppity ? Yes . " I got nothing against them as long as they stays in their place . " It 's not the promotion . That doesn 't bug me . It 's this attitude of yours . Ever since you made Detective Two , you 've been rubbing my face in it . I have not . You have too . And I 'm not gonna stand here and listen to it . You can 't walk away . I 'm not finished yet . Watch me . All right . Go ahead . Maybe you didn 't know , Detective Twos make $ 100 a week more . ( SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) I thought we 'd be having raw veggies . That smells great . Thank you . It 's one of Wolfgang Puck 's recipes . I made a few changes . That 's a new look . Thank you . You like it ? Yeah . I thought you couldn 't have cooked food . A little won 't hurt . Isn 't the cheese animal fat ? One way to overcome allergies ... is to expose yourself to small amounts of the allergen . That way , you build up an immunity . Don 't forget , we are very adaptable . Bon appetit ! It 's good , interesting . You said you made some changes in the recipe . I added some marshmallows , I know how much you like them . And some mint ? Oh , you can tell ? Do you like it ? Lasagna is a very popular human dish , isn 't it ? Yes , very . Bottoms up . Fine . I 'm fine . Please . I kind of had a late lunch . Phil brought over some pastrami sandwiches . I had a lot of sauerkraut ... onion rings ... Cathy , are you okay ? Let me get you to the bathroom . I 'm so embarrassed . Don 't be . I 'm sorry , Matt . It 's okay . ( CRASHING ) Cathy ? It was reported to me , by the parents of one of our students ... that you were seen after school , being intimate with Buck Francisco . Intimate ? What does that mean ? Specifically , I understand that you and Buck were ... what is known as French kissing . Who told you that ? You know I can 't divulge that person 's name . I know where this comes from . Noah Ramsey is jealous of Buck and I would think he told his parents . Jealous ? Buck is a better student . I have not been intimate with him . I spend time with him ... because he enjoys learning . I 've heard about your extracurricular reading program . I 've had complaints about that , too . Mr. Fisher , these kids deserve more than what 's on the approved reading list . As always , you know more than anyone . Miss Houston , this is part of a larger problem . The radical politics , the activism , always pushing , always testing . This time you 've gone too far . You 're not gonna take this accusation seriously ? I think you 'd be happier at another school . I think you should put in for a transfer . You can forget about that , Mr. Fisher . Then I 'll be forced to refer this matter of you and Buck Francisco ... to the school board . Are you going to blackmail me with this ? Any kind of molestation or sexual impropriety charge ... and the board tends to err on the side of caution . You might find you won 't be teaching anywhere . He 's all yours . Bukowski 's going in for psychiatric evaluation . Other than that letter , there 's nothing to implicate him in the murders . Bukowski is a loner with no ties to any Purist organization . He 's a high-school dropout with no medical or scientific background . I read your report . I don 't believe he 's the killer . Amazing deduction , Detective Two . What are you doing ? Trying to find some connection between the murders ... unless you got an idea that 's worth $ 100 a week more . Matt , I realize you 're not very well exposed to me right now ... but we can 't let that affect our case . Despite your feelings of envy , we still have to work together . What ? Just a hunch . That 's Dr. Bogg 's employment records . Why ? Envy . Here it is . Two years ago , Dr. Bogg worked as a chemist for Onyx Pesticides . The company our wine connoisseur , Rick Parris , took to court . He said that they stole his patent . Five will get you 10 , it was Dr. Bogg Parris blamed for ripping off that patent . So Parris killed Dr. Bogg and Judge Kaiser who ruled in Bogg 's favor . Yeah , it was all a personal vendetta . Well , it 's possible . Thanks , boss . Go get your shoes polished . I 'm getting a warrant and bringing him in . I 'm going with you . George , this could get rough , we 'll be on the water . Do us both a favor , stay here . You 're just doing this to piss me off . I have a responsibility to the case . Baloney . I could 've handled this alone , and you know it . You 'll just get in my way . Oh , wonderful . There goes Parris ' boat . What are we going to do ? You 're the senior officer , don 't you know ? We 'll call the Coast Guard . Wrong answer . Police . I need to commandeer your boat . We need to commandeer this boat . You 're not going out there , George . I most certainly am . George , this is the ocean . Sulfuric acid . I 'm aware of the danger . Look , I don 't need to worry about covering my ass and yours . I am the superior officer . I make the decisions . Damn it ! I 'm so sick of this . I 'm sick of you ! Maybe you should put in for new partner . Maybe that 's a good idea . After I make the arrest . Out of there ! Get your hands off me . Stay out of that boat . You 're not going in that boat . I 'm giving you an order . Look out for the water , George . Stay away . It 's salt water . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm in charge . You 'll never make Detective Two . You dumb Slag . You 're gonna kill yourself . ( EXPLOSION ) We ought to know any minute . Coming in now . We 'll need a couple of back-up units here . Thank you for your help . What did you find ? Most of one body , Parris ' . It was a hell of a bang . Until I perform an autopsy , we 'll consider that the cause of death . Any indications ? Was it murder , accidental death , suicide ? It 's hard to say until SID determines the cause of the explosion . It could have been suicide , but sleeping pills or bullets are a lot easier . As soon as I have something , I 'll let you know . Thank you . Well , until the tests come back , there 's really not much for us to do . No . Matt . Yeah ? I was just thinking of the things that we said to each other back there ... when we were so angry . Yeah . I was wondering ... Yeah ? Well , if you didn 't want to apologize . Funny , George , I was thinking the same thing about you . I don 't think I have anything to apologize for . Me neither . I guess you 'll be putting in for a new partner then . I guess I will . I thought I had the wrong day . I 'm sorry I 'm late , Buck . That 's okay . I just read this really great book : Catcher in the Rye . You know it ? Yeah . I loved it when I was your age , too . I 'm gonna read all of Salinger . We could talk about him in our next session . Buck , there isn 't going to be a next session . Somebody reported to Mr. Fisher that you and I are ... having an affair . What ? I have to transfer schools . Why ? It 's not true . Mr. Fisher will take it to the school board , if I don 't transfer . Let him . We 'll fight it . Not this time . I can 't . I don 't understand . Buck , I want you to know it 's been a real pleasure having you as a student . Why are you talking to me like this ? " What a pleasure it 's been " ? You act as if we hardly know one another . I got to go . Marilyn . Why ? Because it could happen . Because I want it to happen . Did I give you the tickets ? No , I don 't think so . Oh , let me check . Here they are . Good . I 'll take them . Thank you . Cathy , hi . Hello , Matt . How 's it going ? Matt , this is Joshua Tree . Joshua , Matt Sikes . Yeah , hi . Hi . Would you get the car ? Yeah . I owe you an explanation . You and me , Matt ... it just isn 't possible . What are you talking about ? Why ? Because I can 't be human . I never asked you to be human . I know . Not with words , no . But I always knew that was what you wanted . Cathy , we are different . But you can 't expect it to be easy . I care so much for you , Matt . But when we 're together , I sense you looking at me ... and I feel incomplete ... like I should have hair and ears ... and I should eat the food that you do ... and make love the way you do . I come away feeling like there 's something wrong with me . But there isn 't . This is what I am . A Tenctonese ... an alien . You 're right . We are different . And I don 't think you can love those differences . Cathy , I ... Don 't , Matt , please . This isn 't fair to me . We are what we are . Nothing would change . It 's all right . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah . Hi , Lorraine . What 's that ? Yeah , I love jerk chicken . I don 't know about tonight , though . Yeah , well , okay . Okay . That sounds great . Come on over . Bye . There you are . Did you get one ? Yeah . Veebo . That 's a triple letter score on the click ... and double word , 35 points . Right , Dad ? Is it my turn ? What 's the matter ? You 've been doppelganger all night . Doppel what ? It 's an expression . It means you haven 't been yourself . I 'm sorry . It 's this business with Matthew . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) I 'll get it . Hi . This is for a Mrs. Francisco . Mom , look . Who would send me flowers ? Thanks . You 're welcome . Smell them . They 're lovely . Are these from you , George ? No . Who are they from ? Let 's see . " You 're far lovelier than these flowers . " Signed , " an admirer . " No ! I 'm so full , I 'm gonna throw up . I 'm just kidding . Tell me something . Would you rather that I didn 't show up tonight ? Why ? I don 't know . It 's sort of like you 're not really here . I 'm sorry . It 's been a hell of a day . No , I 'm glad you came over . Really . Oh , God , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It 's all right . I should know never to make romantic moves like that . It 's all right . I 'll change shirts . I 'm such a klutz . No ... I 'll change shirts . It 's all right . Really , it 's nothing . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Matt . It 's Cathy . Matt . What is it ? Matt , I just got a call from my medical center . The Francisco family has been taken to intensive care . It 's that bacteria . They 've been exposed . I 'll get a shirt . Let me get the door , Miss Bryant . We have it . I saw the news . Why did you blow up his boat ? Parris wanted $ 1,000,000 . He wouldn 't negotiate . We have all the equipment we need . It 'll take about two weeks to produce enough bacteria to spray LA County . Thirty-six hours after that , they 'll all be dead . You 've done a good job , Mark . For the first time in six years , I feel like there 's hope . Soon , we 'll look back on the Newcomers as if they were all just a bad dream . Good night .

At 09 : 22 local time today , an American nuclear submarine , the USS Montana , with 156 men aboard went down about 22 miles from here . - Damn . - Been no contact with the sub since . The cause of the incident is not known . Your company 's authorized the Navy 's use Of this facility for a rescue operation . Codename .. " Operation Salvor . " - You want us to search for the sub ? - No . We know where it is . But she 's in 2,000 feet of water and we can 't reach her . We need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors , if any . Don 't you guys have your own stuff for this kind of thing ? By the time we get our rescue submersibles , storm front will be on us . You can get your rig in under the storm and be on site in 15 hours , and that makes you our best option . Why should we risk our butts for something like this ? I have been authorized to offer special bonuses ... equivalent to three times normal dive pay . Yes , sir , buddy ! Hell , for triple time , I 'd eat Beanie . They could set me on fire and put me out with horse piddle .

Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible , fine , it 's a Russian submersible . - No problem . - Yeah , but you think it was somethin ' else . What ? One of ours ? - No . - Well , whose then ? Come on , Lindsey , talk to me . Look , Jammer saw something down there , something that scared the hell out of him . His mixture got screwed up . Jammer panicked . He pranged his regulator , and his mixture got screwed up . But what did he see that made him panic ? Well , what do you think he saw ? I don 't know . - Did any of you see it ? - No , sir . The Brigman woman saw it . It could have been a Russian bogey . Oh , Cinclant fleet 's gonna go ape shit . Two Russian attack subs , a Tango and a Victor , were tracked within 50 miles of here . Now they don 't know where the hell they are . Okay . [ Sighs ] I haven 't got any choice . I 'm confirming you to go to phase two . You 'll recover one warhead , arm it ... and wait for further instructions . - We got a problem with that ? - Negative , sir . - [ Whistles ] Better come on . - Turn it up , folks . Sources have not confirmed any reports that the Montana encountered ... a Soviet fast-attack sub prior to its sinking , and the Kremlin continues to deny any involvement . Oh , that 's us . That 's us , man . Benthic Petroleum are apparently participating in the recovery operation , but we have little information about their involvement . Bullshit . We want names . - That 's the Explorer . We 're famous . - Shh , quiet . There is a tremendous amount of activity . With Cuba only 80 miles away , the massive buildup of American forces ... has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow . Russian and Cuban trawlers , Undoubtedly surveillance vessels , have been circling the area , - and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away . - This sucks . Hippy , what 's the matter with you ? What 's the matter with me ? Nothing . We 're just in the middle Of some big-time international incident , like the Cuban missile crisis or something . Figured that out for yourself , did you , Hip ? We got Russian subs creepin ' around . Anything goes wrong , they could say whatever they want happened . Relax , will you ? You 're makin ' the women nervous . - Cute , Virgil . - You know , those seals ain 't telling us diddly . - Somethin ' is going on ! - Come on , come on . Hippy , you think everything 's a conspiracy . Everything is . Hurry up ! Coffey 's splitting with Flatbed . - I showed him how to work the controls , and they 're outta here . - Damn it . - Didn 't you tell him we need it right now ? - He didn 't pay attention . - Where the hell is he taking it ? - I have no idea ! Shit ! Coffey ! Come back ! We need the big arm to unhook the umbilical . There 's a goddamn hurricane comin ' ! - He switched off . - It 's unbelievable . Go back down . Tell those men to get below and stay there . We need to get unhooked and get out of here now . All right , do it then . No problem , except your boys went sightseeing with Flatbed . My people need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end . - Back in two hours . - Two hours ? We 're gonna get the shit kicked out of us by our pal Fred in two hours . - Set cold tab fitting to 200 P.S.I. - Set . There she goes . She 's breaking loose . Bringing her up . Okay . All right . Get clear of the hatch . Keep goin with it . Keep goin ' . That 's it , up . Sir , the missile looks intact . Little is known at this hour about the events leading up to the collision . The U.S. Navy guided missile Cruiser Appleton ... apparently struck the Soviet destroyer ... in low visibility conditions . In violent seas , little hope remains for over 100 Russian crewmen ... still missing after the sinking an hour ago . Soviet military spokesmen have claimed that the collision ... constituted an unprovoked attack . - This was denied by state department officials ... - Bud , this is big time . who said that Captain Michael Sweeney was acting correctly- - Okay , it 's clear . It 's all yours , sir . - Swing it away and drop it . - Check . Okay . Bypass the ground connection on the separation sequencer . - Got it ? - Separation sequencer disconnected . Remove explosive bolts one through six in counterclockwise sequence . Check . Removing bolt one . Negotiators have walked out of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ... - in protest over the incident this morning- - - [ Changes Channel ] [ Translator ] The sudden deterioration of relations with the United States- - Soviet buildup of tanks and aircraft has continued .

What can anyone do ? Hey , I mean , they love their kids too . So why are we doin ' this ? If it happens , it happens . There 's nothing I can do about it , right ? I just don 't think about it . All right . Let 's get their gear off ! Then clear the sub . We got to get it out of here ! Come on . Let 's go . Let 's move it . One Night , you 're up . Get ready to roll , baby . - Don 't touch that . Just back away . - Excusez-moi . Hey , Coffey , we are a little pressed for time . Prick . This ain 't no drill , slick . Make me proud .

I was under orders . I had no choice . How 's it goin ' , Cat ? What 's the scoop , Ace ? Well , I can get power to this module in sub bay ... I 'll reroute these buses , but I gotta get past the mains , which are a total meltdown . [ Sighs ] Bud , there won 't be enough to run the heaters . In a few hours , this place is gonna be as cold as a meat locker . What about O-2 ? Yeah , well , brace yourself . If we close off the sections we 're not using , we have about maybe 12 hours ' worth . Storm 's gonna last a lot longer than 12 hours . Yeah , well , I can maybe extend that . Maybe . There 's some storage tanks outboard next to the wrecked module . I 'll have to go outside , though , and tie onto them . - Linds . - Yeah ? I 'm glad you 're here . [ Sighs ] Yeah . I 'm not . Hey . Found Cab 3 . Deader than dog shit , boss . That girder went right through The brainpan . [ Bud ] Yeah , I see that . - Where are you ? - Living quarters , level two . Oh , geez . [ Hippy ] That 's Perry . That 's it , then . Finler , McWorter , Dietz and Perry . Jesus . Uh , we just leave ' em there ? For now . We got no choice . First priority 's to get something to breathe . [ Bud Over Radio ] Where are you now , Linds ? I 'm under the starboard tri module . - Still with me , Hip ? - [ Hippy Over Radio ] Right behind you , Linds . How 's it look ? [ Lindsey Over Radio ] You guys really screwed up my rig . There 's a lot Of wreckage out here . - Well , don 't get fouled . - Hit me with that 9 / 16 , okay ? - Yeah . - Thank you . So , there you were . Yeah , there we were , side by side on the same ship for two months . I 'm a tool pusher , and we 're testing this automated derrick of hers . We get back on the beach and we 're living together . Doesn 't mean you had to marry her . Well , we were due to go back out on the same ship- - six months of tests . If you were married , you got a stateroom . Otherwise , it was bunks . Okay , good reason . Come tighten this . Then what ? Everything was all right there for a while , you know . Then she got promoted to chief engineer on this thing a couple years ago . She went front office on you , man ? Yeah , well , you know Lindsey . She 's just too damn aggressive- - - Son of a bitch . - [ Tool Clatters ] She didn 't leave me . She just left me behind . Bud , let me tell you somethin ' . She ain 't half as smart as she thinks she is . - [ Laughs ] Get outta here . - [ Laughing ] [ Hippy ] Come on . Let 's see those muscles . Bingo . That 's one . Two for two . - Hey . Hey . - [ Static Humming ] Lindsey , do you read me ? Over . Copy you , Hippy . What 's the matter ? Oh , shit . The power 's jackin around with us again . Lindsey , come back . I just lost video . Lindsey , are you there ? Hippy , do you copy ? - Linds , you copy ? - [ Radio Static ] Shit . What the hell- - Hippy , do you copy ? Damn it . Bud , do you copy ? Over . Uh , I seem to be having a problem here . Shit . Damn it . [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] - That 's a great shot , Linds . - You drop your dive line ? Come on , you guys . Come on . That 's the smaller one . You can kinda see how it 's zigging around . - Yeah , whatever it is . - I 'm telling you what it is . - You 're just not hearing me . - Now , Lindsey , you- - There is something down there . Something not us . You could be more ... specific . - Something that zigs . - Not us . Not human . Get it ? Something nonhuman , but intelligent . A non terrestrial intelligence . - A non terrestrial intelligence . - Yes . N.T.I.s. Oh , man , that 's better than U.F.O.s. But that works too , huh ? Underwater flying objects . Are we talking little space friends here ? Hell , yeah ! Hot rods of the gods ! Right , Linds ? No , really . It could be N.T.I.s. The C.I.A. has known about ' em forever . They abduct people all the time . Hippy , would you do me a favor ? Stay off my side . - Will you step into my office , please ? - Certainly . I- - Come here . - Jesus , Linds . - Oh , Bud , come on . Something really important is happening here . I 'm trying to keep this situation under control . - I can 't allow you to create this kind of hysteria . - Who 's hysterical ? - Nobody 's hysterical ! - Shh . All I 'm saying is , when you 're hangin ' on by your fingernails , you don 't go waving your arms around . Look , I saw something . I 'm not gonna say I didn 't see it when I did . I 'm sorry . Please . You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew . Yes . I am . But I need you to believe me right now . Come on , look at me . Am I stressed out ? Do I have any symptoms of pressure sickness ? Tremor ? Slurred speech ? - No . - No . Bud , this is me , Lindsey . Okay ? You know me better than anybody in the world . Now watch my lips . I saw these things . I touched one of them , and it wasn 't some clunky steel can like we would build . It glided . It was the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . Oh , God , I wish you 'd been there . It was a machine- - It was a machine , but it was alive . It was like a- - like a dance of light . Please . You have to trust me . Now , I don 't think they mean us any harm . I don 't know how I know that . It 's just a feeling . Geez . I 'm supposed to go on a feeling ? How can I ? You think Coffey 's gonna go on a feeling ? Well , we all see what we wanna see . Coffey looks , and he sees Russians . He sees hate and fear . You have to look with better eyes than that . - Please . - I can 't , Linds . - No ? Mmm . - I 'm sorry . [ Coffey ] All I want is 24-hour surveillance on the exterior cam . - [ Cat Shouting ] - I 've got six people , I 've got- - Everybody just stop . All right , I want a round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras . That Russian bogey comes back , I don 't think we should be taking a nap . Oh , give me a break , Coffey . Those things live three-and-a-half miles down in an abyssal trench . Trust me , they 're not Speaking Russian . - Have you finished the repairs on the acoustical transmitter yet ? - Nope . Why not ? I was having my nails done . Well , get it done . Kiss my ass . All right , get somethin ' straight . You people are under my authority . - Look , partner- - - When I give you an or- - Look , partner , we don 't work for you , we don 't take orders from you ... and we don 't much like you . Hey , Cat . Cat ! - Yeah ? - Why don 't you take the first watch on sonar , okay ? Right on . Sonny , you get a couple hours sleep , then you spell Cat . Hippy , you handle exterior surveillance . [ Shuddering ] One Night . Would you do me a favor and see if you can get that transmitter fixed ? - All right ? - Be a couple hours . - [ Click ] - Got it . All right . Come on , A.J. squared-away , a little to the left . [ Hippy ] What is that ? Oh , this is not happening . Oh , man . [ Hippy ] Look at me . I 'm shakin ' . All right , wait , wait , wait . And now ... here 's MIRV . Come on , man . What else could it be ? Why bring it here ? It 's gotta be some kind of emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians . Look , they hot-wire one of the nukes , they use some kind of detonator that they brought , then they stick it back in the sub , fry the whole thing up . Bam ! Slicker than snot . I 'm tellin ' ya . And I 'm not bein ' paranoi- - Hi , Linds . Linds , will you just wait a second . Goddamn it , if you don 't do something about it , I will ! Lindsey , we 'll do something about it ! Just wait a second ! - Lindsey . - What ? - Just stop and think about this . - What ? [ Banging Continues ] You got some huevos bringing that thing into my rig . With all that 's going on up in the world , you bring a nuclear weapon in here ? Mrs. Brigman- - Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic , or is it just me ? Mrs. Brigman , you don 't need to know the details of our operation . It 's better if you don 't . You 're right . I don 't need to know . What I need to know is that thing is off this rig ! Do you hear me , Roger Ramjet ? You 're becoming a serious impediment to our mission . Now , you either do an about-face and walk out of here , or I 'll have you escorted out . I will not do an about-face and get out of here . - Who do you think you 're talking- - - [ Alarm Bell Rings ] Emergency ! Maintenance Room B ! Everybody move it ! - On the double ! - Now ! Now ! - [ Alarm Continues ] - In here ! Come on ! We 've got trouble ! - Now ! Come on ! - What 's goin ' on ? - All right , all right , all right , all right ! - [ Alarm Stops ] [ One Night ] What 's up ? What 's happening ? You let her go , man . Do it . Do it now ! Let her go . [ Grunts ] That was the smartest thing you ever did . - Coffey , you son of a bitch- - - Lindsey ! Cool it . - [ Cat ] What 's the problem ? - Nothin ' . We were just leaving . Weren 't we ? W-We don 't need them . We can 't trust them . We may have to take steps . We 're gonna have to take steps . Linds , I want you to stay away from that guy . - I mean it . - The guy is gone . Did you see his hands ? What ? He 's got the shakes ? Look , he 's operating on his own , he 's cut off from his chain of command , he 's showing signs of pressure-induced psychosis ... and he 's got a nuclear weapon . So , as a favor to me , try to put your tongue in neutral for a while . I gotta tell you , I give this whole thing a sphincter factor of about 9.5 . Look , you can just punch into his primary guidance chip where you want him to go ... and he 'll go there , right ? - No . Bad idea , Lindsey . Bad . - Why ? Hip , come on . Because even if it could take the pressure at that depth , - which I don 't think it can , - Yeah ? without the tether you know what 'd happen when it got down there ? It would just sit like- - Please . It would just sit like a dumb shit . Something would have to pass in front Of the camera for you to see anything . But we could get lucky , right ? So we should go for it . - I really ought to talk to Bud about this . - This is between you and me . We get proof , and then we tell the others . If we can prove to Coffey that there aren 't Russians down there , maybe he 'll ease off the button a little bit . I gotta tell ya , that guy scares me more than anything we 're gonna find down there . He 's a goddamn A.J. squared-away , Jar-head robot . It 's- - All right , give me a couple hours to see what I can do . Great . Thanks . How 's that ? Thanks . [ Snoring ] Virgil , turn on your side . [ Pinging ] [ Static , Pinging Continues ] All right , you 're all set , big guy . Hey , I told you to wipe that grin off your face . Good night , little buddy . [ Gasps ] [ Whispers ] Bud . Bud .

[ One Night ] What is it ? - Take it easy , Hippy . - I 'm all right . - Pretty slick , Slick . - Hold it really steady . [ One Night ] Is it alive ? [ Bud ] Lindsey , no . Sea water . [ One Night ] Oh , man . Come on . Come on ! - Hurry ! - Where the hell 's it goin ' ? Huh ? Hurry ! I think it 's headed for " B " module . Linds , you see it ? [ Gasps ] [ Shuddering , Grunting ] - Aah ! - Aah ! Aaah ! [ Shivering ] [ Whimpering , Continues Shivering ] [ Static Stops ] [ Pinging Continues ] [ Lindsey ] So , raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water tentacle . Lieutenant ? No ? Well . A breakthrough . Hey , Ace , you done impressing ' yourself ? No way that thing Could just be sea water . They must have learned to control water . I mean at a molecular level . They can plasticize it , polymerize it , do whatever they want to do with it . They can put it under intelligent control . Maybe their whole technology 's based on that . - What ? - Controlling water . - [ Hippy ] Was it the same thing that you saw the last time ? - No . You know , I don 't think that that thing you saw was one of them . - What are you talking about ? - I mean , I don 't think it was an N.T.I. I think it was their version Of an R.O.V. , like Big Geek . - [ Cat ] Hippy , you mean they was just checkin ' us out ? - Yeah . - How come ? We 're probably the first people That have ever seen one . Who 's been down this far ? - [ Grunting ] - [ Cat ] Sure hope they don 't judge the rest of us by him . [ Grunts ] Went straight for the warhead , and they think it 's cute . You need to get some sleep . [ Panting ] We have no way ... of warning the surface . You know what that means ? It means whatever happens ... is up to us . Us . [ Grunting ] [ One Night ] So you think they 're from down there originally , or from , you know- - [ Laughs ] I don 't know . I think- - I think they 're from " you know . " Someplace with similar conditions- - cold , intense pressure . Oh , man . Happy as hogs in a waller down there , probably . [ Metallic Spinning Sound ] [ Gasps ] [ Spinning Sound Continues ] [ Spinning Sound Continues , Louder ] [ Gasps ] Sniff somethin ' ? Did you , rat boy ? [ Grunts ] - [ Grunting ] - Hey , hey , hey ! Freeze ! Don 't move ! That 's right . You okay , Hip ? - They 're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the N.T.I.s. - What ? - We set it up to go right to ' em . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Take this . We 're going to phase three . [ Groaning ] What ? We don 't have orders for that ! [ Hippy ] I programmed Big Geek ... to go down to the bottom of the trench and shoot some video . - Now they 've got the warhead tied to it . - Coffey ? - Linds- - - Coffey- - No . Come on . Just think about What you 're doing just one minute . Just think about What you 're- - Aaah ! Get back ! This is something I 've wanted to do since we first met . [ Tearing ] [ Whimpers ] Easy .

Your boss is fixin to pull the pin on 50 kilotons , and we 're all gonna be ring side ! He 's having a full-on meltdown ! - What 's the timer set for ? - Three hours . - Shut up . Don 't talk . - Three hours ? We can 't get to minimum safe distance in three hours . - We can 't go to phase three . What about these people ? - Shut up . What 's the matter with you ? Everybody just stay calm . The situation is under control . [ Grunts ] Anybody touches that door , kill ' em . Schoenick , your lieutenant 's about to make a real bad career move . - The guy 's crazier than a shithouse rat ! - Schoenick ! - They 're trying to make contact ! - Can 't you see he 's lost it ? - Shut up ! - The shockwave 'll kill us . - Quiet ! - It 'll crush this rig like a beer can . - What are you talking about ? - We gotta stop him . Shut up ! This is no tour mission . We can 't detonate without orders . [ Lindsey ] Schoenick , please ! [ Grunting , Yelling ] He 's about to declare war on an alien species just when they 're trying to make contact ! Please ! - I think I 'm reaching him . - Yeah . [ Lock Clanks ] - [ Hippy Chuckling ] - I 'll be damned . - [ Bud ] Jammer ! - Is everybody okay ? - [ Laughs ] - Oh , man ! - Don 't move , jar face ! - I 'm the least of your problems . How you feelin ' , big guy ? I 'm okay , Bud , I- - I just figured I was dead back there when I saw that angel comin ' for me . Uh- - Yeah , okay . Tell us about it later . Come on .

And you just- - you just lit up another candle and put it beside mine ... and you said , " No . See , that 's me . That 's me .

Doctor , you integrated Einstein . Calm down , Marty I didn 't intergrated anything . The strap is completely intact . Where the hell are they ? The appropriate question is When the hell are they ? Because you see Einstein has just become the world first time traveller . Back into the future ! One millions into future years to be exact . Now precisely One twenty one am in zero second we shall catch up with him . Wait a minute ! Wait a minute . Doct ... you tell me you build a time machine ? The way I see it . If can built a time machine into a car why not do it some style . Besides the fading the steel ... Look out ! What it is huh ? It 's cold , air cold . Einstein ! You little fellow . Einstein 's clock is exactly one minute behide mine . It 's still taking . He alright . - He fine . He completely on the way if anything happens . As far as he is concerned the tripple intense tendentious That why his watch it exactly one minute behide mine . He skipped all that minute to insulted arrive at this moment of time .

This is what makes time travel possible . The flux capacity - What a capacity ? It taken almost thirty years , Of my entire family fortune to realise the vision of that day . My god It has been that long . Things have certainly changed around here . I remembered when it all farmland as far as I could see . All people had this crazy idea . About building pines trees .

Excuse me , for the crudity of this model . I didn 't have time to built it to scale with a pen . It 's good . - Thank you , thank you . Okay now , We 'll run some industrial strength electrical cables from the top of the clock tower down to the street between these two lampposts Meanwhile , this pole and hook run into direct in to the capacity . At calculate moment you start off down from the street towards the cable accelerating at 80 mph Pointing to the flyer at precisely 10 : 04 pm . This Saturday night lighting will strike the clock tower electrifying the cable just as the connecting hook makes contact . Thereby sending the electricity into the flux capacity . And sending you back in 1985 . Alright now watch this you want to release it . I 'll simulate the lighting . Ready . Set ! Release ! You tell me with lots of confidence Doc . Don 't worry you just take care of your pop . By the way , what happened today . Did he ask her out ? - I think so . What did she said . It 's you mum . Cover the car .

I still don 't understand , how am I supposed to go to the dance with her if she already going to the dance with you ? Because George she want to goes with you . She just doesn 't know it yet . That why we got to show it to you George Mcfly are a fighter somebody who can stand up for yourself Somebody who can protect her . But I never pick a fight in my entire life . How could you be picking a fight dad ... dad ... daddyo . You 're coming to a rescue right ? Okay , come back to my plan again . 8 : 55 where you going to be ?

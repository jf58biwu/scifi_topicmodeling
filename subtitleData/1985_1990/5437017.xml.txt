 S SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS Stardust Boys ! However you look at us , we ain 't no Superman We can 't even be stars of the space opera We can 't even save anyone at a critical moment , and won 't show up as you expect .

But still , We are not totally and utterly useless . Stardust Boys still have some hope ! You know , we , Stardust Boys ... have some virtues after all ... Stardust Boys ! Translation by Jimbakyu Sync by Marian MYSTERIOUS LAILALA VILLAGE Rana really went back alone . Rana , pepo . We cancelled the ' one in 3 days ' carriage and came here to take Rana back ! How heartless he is ! Toppy and Giraffe , how heartless you are .. Got no money , no hotel , no acquaintance , left alone in such a sick place ! What am I gonna do ? Oh ! I think I 've just heard Toppy 's voice ... Arrgghh .. Is this what they call an auditory hallucination ? ! I ... Argh ... I 'm gonna go mad before long , probably ... Rana must be taking a nap on the ships ' deck right now .. Anyway , what can we do now ? Hmm .. Hmm .. Haa .. Did Anne take a carriage ? Or we could take Pira highway by walk , if we knew which one she took .. Sibip ! Hey , Sibip ! Sibip ! Where you 're going ? Somehow , this chap looks confident . Ha .. Maybe that 's it ! Sibip might know which route Prof. Anne took ? ! You 're kidding ! But , just think about what things Sibip has done so far . I 'm not so sure , but at least Sibip has some mysterious power for sure . Supernatural power ! Oh .. Eh .. Aaahh .. Aah .. Am I gonna die of starvation on such an unfamiliar planet ? ! Ha .. ! ? Haa .. ! Ha .. Oh my .. ! This is an Earth assault ship ! Hey , you 're ok ? Oh my .. , have to treat him quick ! This way ! What ? Who are you ? It seems we 've come off the highway quite a bit , if that one below is the Pira highway the captain was talking about . Sibip ! You 're sure Prof. Anne took this way ? % $ # % $ , pepo . Look , did Sibip understand what I said ? But it 's useless if we can 't understand what he says . Anyway , we 've come this far already , seems no choice but to go on . Wow ! What a nice view ! Oohh .. Ha .. ! Ooohh .. ! Don 't tell me ! Uh .. Haa .. ! ... that 's why it lost control . The pilot sustained injury which will take three weeks to heal completely . The battleship can be repaired rather easily . Glad it was a rather minor accident . Well anyway , the important operation is near , so make sure there will be no more incidents . Yes sir ! Captain Gorian ! I brought Rana of Space Service Agency . Ok . Nice meeting you ! Someone from the company , in a place like this ! Indeed ... I 've already heard that you established a base in Koo-Nyo , but I could never imagine it 's hiding behind a waterfall . I 've got nothing to do with the battleship 's accident ! Naah .. There 's a reason for bothering you to come all the way here . Do you know for what reason we are staying here ? Uhm .. , do this or that with Uranium from Vega III or something like that .. Haaha .. " do this or that " , what a masterpiece comment ! Well , it 's such a grand project , that small companies like yours have no hope to be involved in . At least you must know that Earth is running out of resources . It 's clear that Uranium will run out sooner rather than later . So ... You can make big bucks by mining Uranium and sending it back to Earth . Not only business , but also the Earth 's issue of resource shortage can be solved . We 've been researching this area since quite a while ago , and about a week ago , we 've finally found that huge amount of Uranium lies under the ground of a nearby village .. .. here . To excavate Uranium , we need to dig up the whole village . We 've negotiated with village residents over and over , and asked them to sell us their land .. .. for 500kg of gold . 500kg of gold ? ! However , the residents insist there 's no way they would sell their land . Why not ? Surprised too ? ! Because they 're a bunch of uncivilized people , they don 't wanna leave the homeland they 've grown up upon . So .. .. what you 're gonna do ? No choice but to have them go . Oh , no .. That 's very selfish of you ! Selfish ? You can 't conduct business with such feelings . Especially for big companies like ours . Force is necessary to some extent . But ... Now let 's talk about why we 've bothered you to come here . Can you accept the role of urging them to evacuate ? To evacuate ? You know , our excellent pilot was injured in the accident just a while ago . Cut it out ! I don 't like to do such a ruthless job ! Ruthless ? It 's not like killing someone . Just threaten them a bit and they will run away for a while . Then we 'll take the opportunity to start the excavation . Of course , we promise you a reward . Reward ? ! If you succeed in evacuating the villagers , we 're gonna hire you as a regular employee . Ah .. oh .. Must be hard to take care of a family with 7 kids , huh ? Retirement pay will be merely a chicken feed . Just pretend to be attacking from the air , that 's it . Name of the village ? Lailala . It 's such a small village . Lailala , Lailala ! Is Prof. Anne in that village ? You 're sure ? $ % % # Lailala pepo . No use asking . Anyway , let 's go . We 'll see . Uh .. ! Why you 're stopping us ? We need to go there now if Anne is in that village . Oh .. ? Sibip ! Lailala village , Sibip 's hometown . I see , this village is your hometown ! No wonder there is similar looking people .. I see .. Oh .. ? Sibip , you 've just spoken Earth language ... . Huh ! So , you 've been pretending that you cannot speak ? Pe .. po .. " Counting on you . " " Don 't forget the promise you 've made . " " Haha .. I 'll keep my promise . " Sibip finally came back to my home after long , long trip . Just one week ago .. Eh .. ha .. ha .. Ha .. ? Daddy , Mommy ! Daddy ! Ha .. ! Sibip .. Ha .. ! Mysterious illness was prevalent in the village when Sibip came back after a long time . Scary disease , no medicine is efficient . But you thought maybe Earth medical technology can cure them , and that 's why you tried to get acquainted with us . Perhaps , that disease is beri-beri . Ha .. ? Beri-beri ? Yes . It is said that lack of vitamin B1 causes the disease . According to Sibip , the epidemic began a few months ago when the crop of rice-like grains , their main food , suffered suddenly . So , they couldn 't get vitamin B1 from the grains anymore ? Yes . So , it 's possible to cure them if we can give them vitamin B1 . He said you don 't need to worry about your parents anymore . Ha .. ! Wow ! Sibip , Wow .. pepo ! But .. Why didn 't you tell us about that when we met ? ! He 's right . You even pretended you can 't understand the language . Uh .. Oh please ! What about Prof. Anne ? ! This bastard tricked us ! Taking us to such a rural area for his own purposes ! Moron ! Now we 've almost lost Anne completely ! Hopeless ! How you 'll make up for this ? Forgive me , pepo ! Not gonna forgive you , no matter how much ... Giraffe , calm down ! Sibip ! Why didn 't you tell us the truth ? Giraffe , Rana and I didn 't come here to have fun , you know that , right ? Ha .. ! % $ # # $ # % % # # $ $ . Huh ? Earth people have come to Lailala .. .. a lot , a lot ! They dug up the mountain everywhere and told us to leave this village . Cosmo Service ! That 's it ! They dug up everywhere for research , that 's why soil quality changed and crop suffered . Bastards ! How terrible ... ! Is that thunder ? No .. That is ... Haa .. ! Cosmo Service assault ship ! Heading to village . What are they doing ? Oh .. ? What is that ? Could it be .. .. a terrifying weapon ? Shoot Gorian ! Too sweet an offer to be true , as I thought . Uh .. ? ! Ha .. ! Haa ... ! Uh , uh ... mike check ... Eh .. ! Well , dear Lailala villagers , we are Cosmo Service from Earth .. Th .. .. that voice .. of Rana ... Excavation of Uranium will begin shortly . Get out of this village a.s.a.p. Bastard ... What is he doing .. ? No reaction ... Ok . I 'll try to surprise them a bit . Ha .. ! What ? A lot of Sibips ? Is this Sibip 's village ? Oh ? Toppy ! Giraffe as well ... Wha .. what 's going on ? Rana ! Rana ! Stop this ! Stop it ! " Daddy ! " " Gift for me ! For me as well ! " Toppy , Giraffe ! Sorry ! I feel pity for Sibip and his family , but I feel pity for my family too . Their happiness depends entirely on my re-employment . Ooh .. ! No ... . Stop .. stop it ! Oh .. ? Ah , it 's a musical instrument ! Alright ! Oh my ... ! I was attacked ! That rock was a terrible weapon as I expected ! .. indescribable ... ! The battleship disappeared from the radar . Most likely it crashed ... Unknown weapon , as we suspected ... . We 're not gonna touch that village anymore . We 'll look for another place to develop . But , it 's comforting to know that casualties were not from our company .. ! Yay .. ! Rana ! Hihi .. I 'm glad you two are doing fine . What the heck is going on ? I 'm sorry . How merciless ! Since when you 're a Cosmo Service agent ? Besides , you crashed the plane deliberately ! How dangerous ! Sibip ! Rana , pepo . Sorry Sibip .. You brought me to my senses ! Pepo ! Sibip ! Ah .. Daddy ! Mommy ! Daddy ! Mommy ! Are they all fine now ? I .. am relieved ... Wait ! Does beri-beri cure naturally ? This .. this is .. .. medicine from Earth . Prof. Anne ! Must be the medicine given by her ! Giraffe ! Prof. Anne had stopped by this village too ! How lucky you are Giraffe ! Yes , yes ... They told us that Prof. Anne had gone straight along the Pira highway . Alright , let 's go straight this road ! Before that , Giraffe , you don 't like Sibip , do you ? The bad one who tricked us . Uhm .. well ... So , who was in tears looking at the family ? But it turned out that the real villain was Cosmo Service . Sibip ! Would you like to come with us ? ! Pepo ! Yay , yay !

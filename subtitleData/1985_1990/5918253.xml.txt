 Bio-readouts are all in the green . Looks like she 's alive . Well , there goes our salvage , guys . How are we today ? Terrible . Well , better than yesterday , at least . - Where am I ? - You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station . Been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're OK . Looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy ! Come here ! Hey , come here ! How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ! Where have you been ? Guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Burke . Carter Burke . I work for the company . But ... don 't let that fool you . I 'm really an OK guy . I 'm glad to see you 're feeling better . They say that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon . That 's just natural side effects of such a long hypersleep . Or something like that . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? Has no-one discussed this with you yet ? No . But , I mean , I don 't recognise this place . No , I know . Uh ... OK . It 's just that , uh , this might be a shock to you . - It 's longer ... - How long ? Please . 57 years . What ? That 's the thing . You were out there for 57 years . You had drifted right through the core systems . And it 's really just blind luck that a deep-salvage team found you when they did . It 's one in a thousand , really . You 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . You OK ? You OK ? God ! Nurse ! Please ! Someone get in here now ! No ! Now ! Hold ! Please ! Hold her ! Kill me ! No ! No ! Bad dreams again ? - You want something to help you sleep ? - No . I 've slept enough . Jonesy ... come here . Shh ! It 's all right . It 's all right now . It 's over . I don 't understand this . We have been here for three and a half hours . How many different ways do you want the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please ? You admit to detonating the engines of , and thereby destroying , an M-Class star freighter . An expensive piece of hardware . 42 million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account . In that , for reasons unknown , the Nostromo set down on LV-426 an unsurveyed planet at that time . That it resumed its course , and was subsequently set for self-destruct by you for reasons unknown . Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down there on company orders to get this thing , which destroyed my crew and your expensive ship . The analysis team , which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter , found no evidence of the creature you describe . Good ! That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn airlock . Like I said . Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft , an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds . " A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " - Yes . These are your words . - " And has concentrated acid for blood . " - That 's right . Look , I can see where this is going . But I 'm telling you that those things exist . - Thank you Officer Ripley . That will be all . Please ! You 're not listening to me . Kane , the crew member ... Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs there . - Thank you , that will be all . - Goddammit , that 's not all ! Because if one of those things gets down here , then that 'll be all . Then this bullshit you think is so important you can just kiss all that goodbye ! That could have been ... better . - Look , I think the ... Ripley ! - Van Leuwen ? Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . There have been people there over 20 years , and they never complained about any hostile organism . - What people ? - Terraformers . Planet engineers . They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable . Takes decades . It 's what we call a Shake ' n ' Bake colony . How many are there ? How many colonists ? I don 't know . 60 , maybe 70 , families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus ! Hi , Ripley . This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps ... Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me to the wolves and now you want me to go back out there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . - Can I finish ? - No . There 's no way . You wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I can guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . Lieutenant , Am I right ? We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . Then you don 't need me . I 'm not a soldier . We don 't know what 's going on out there . It may just be a downed transmitter . But if it 's not I would like you there as an advisor , and that 's all . Look , I don 't have time for this . I 've got to get to work . Oh , right . I heard you 're working the cargo docks . That 's right . - Running loaders and forklifts . - Yeah . So ? Nothing . I think it 's great that you 're keeping busy . And I know it 's the only thing that you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . If you go . Come on , that 's a second chance , kiddo . I think personally for you would be the best thing in the world to get out there and face this thing . Get back on the horse . Spare me , Burke . I 've had my psych evaluation this month . Yeah , I know . I 've read it . You wake up every night soaked in sweat ... - I said no ! And I mean it ! Now please leave . I am not going back ! And I am ... I would not be any good to you if I did . OK . Shh . Would you do me a favour ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . Hello . Ripley ? You OK ? Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study . Not to bring back . But to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right , I 'm in . And you , you little shithead you 're staying here . They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? - Is that a joke ? - Oh , I wish it were ! Hey , Hicks . Man , you lookjust like I feel . All right , sweethearts , what are you waiting for ? Breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the Corps ! A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm . Every meal 's a banquet , every paycheck a fortune . Every formation a parade . I love the Corps ! Man , this floor is freezing ! - You want me to fetch your slippers ? - Gee , would you , sir ? Look into my eye . Fall in , people ! Come on , let 's go . I hate this job . Crowe ! Wierzbowski ! On your feet ! I 'm talking about breathing , not this frozen shit . Yeah , Top , how about it ? All right , first assembly 's in 15 , people . Shag it ! Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . Apparently , she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fucking-doo ! Hey , I 'm impressed . Hey , Vasquez . Have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? Oh , Vasquez ! You 're just too bad . Hey , Top , what 's the op ? It 's a rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity . Dumb-ass colonists ! What 's this crap supposed to be ? - Cornbread , I think . - It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . I sure wouldn 't mind getting more of that Arcturian poontang . Remember that time ? - But the one that you had was male ! - Doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian , baby ! - Hey , Bishop . Do the thing with the knife . - Oh , please ... All right ! I don 't wanna see that , man . Hey , what are you doing , man ? What are you doing ? - Don 't move . - Quit messing , Drake ! Bishop ! Hey , man ! - Do it , Bishop . - Hey , not me , man ! Yeah , you . Don 't move . Trust me . All right , knock it off . Thank you . Enjoy your meal . That wasn 't funny , man . - Lieutenant Gorman ? - No . - Mr Burke ? - Yeah , thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts . The boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . I thought you never missed , Bishop . You never said an android was on board . Why not ? It never occurred to me . It 's common practice to have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term " artificial person " myself . Right . - Is there a problem ? - I 'm sorry . I didn 't even ... Ripley 's last trip , the syn ... The artificial person malfunctioned - Malfunctioned ? There were problems and ... a few deaths were involved . I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? Yeah . The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2 . The A-2s always were a bit twitchy . That could never happen now with our behavioural inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm , or allow to be harmed , a human being . You sure you don 't want some ? Just stay away from me , Bishop . You got that straight ? Guess she don 't like the cornbread , either . Squad ! Atten-hut ! Officer on deck ! As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right , listen up ! Morning , Marines . I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you before we left Gateway ... - Sir ? - What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . What 's the question ? Is this gonna be a stand-up fight , sir , or another bug hunt ? All we know is there 's still no contact with the colony and a xenomorph may be involved . - Excuse me , sir . A what ? - A xenomorph . It 's a bug hunt . What exactly are we dealing with here ? Ripley ? I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . A crew member was brought back with something attached to his face some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off . It wouldn 't come off . Later , it seemed to come off by itself and die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner . It must have laid something inside his throat , some sort of embryo . He started ... Um ... Look , man , I only need to know one thing : Where they are . - Go , Vasquez , kick ass ! - Anytime , anywhere . Somebody said " alien " . She thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up ! - Fuck you , man . - Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Yeah , OK , right . Thank you , Ripley . We also have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . One of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours . If the colonists have found that ship , there 's no telling how many have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so look at it . Any questions ? What is it , Private ? How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth and by the numbers . I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830 . Ordnance loading , weapons strip and drop-ship prep details . We have seven hours . Now move it , people ! You heard the man , and you know the drill ! Assholes and elbows ! Hudson , come here . Come here ! I don 't care if you are short , Hudson . Get it done ! - Sarge , you 'll get lip cancer smoking those ! - Corporal , I want this loading lock sealed ! - How many more , Spunkmeyer ? - Last one . Good . Take it away . Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Is this the non-op ? Hi . I feel like kind of a fifth wheel . Is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class Two rating . Be my guest . Where you want it ? Bay twelve , please . We 're a team and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we gonna conquer , and we gonna take some . Is that understood ? That 's what we gonna do , sweethearts . Gonna go and get some . All right , people , on the ready-line ! - Are you lean ? - Yeah ! - Are you mean ? - Yeah ! - What are you ? - Lean , mean Marines ! Get on the ready-line ! Get some today ! Get on the ready-line ! Move it out ! Move it out , goddamn it ! Get hot ! One , two , three ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! One , two , three , four ! One , two , three ! Absolutely badasses ! Let 's pack ' em in ! Get in there ! Move it ! - Let 's go , let 's go ! - One , two , three , four , five , six ! I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed . Let 's go ! Come on , settle down , people . Lock ' em in , Hudson . Ready to get it on ? You know it ! OK , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on ! Go ! Stand by . Cross-locking now . Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by . Ten seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer . On my mark . We 're on an express elevator to hell ! Going down ! Two , one , mark . Switch to DCS ranging . - 2-4-0 . Nominal to profile . - We 're in the pipe . Five by five . - We 're picking up some hull ionisation . - Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? 38 ... Simulated . How many combat drops ? Uh , two including this one . - Shit ! - Oh , man ! Range 0-1-4 . Turning on final . I got a bad feeling about this drop . You always say " I got a bad feeling about this drop " . OK , OK . When we get back without you , I 'll call your folks . All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody on-line . Looking good . Drake , check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . All right , gear up . 2 minutes people , get hot . Somebody wake up Hicks . - Coming around for a seven-zero-niner . - Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . - That 's the atmosphere processor ? - Yep , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . We manufacture those , by the way . OK , Ferro . Take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . All right . Hold at forty . - Roger . - Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . They still have power . OK , Ferro . Set down on the landing grid . Immediate dust-off on my clear , then stay on station . Down and clear . Ten seconds , people . Look sharp ! I want a nice , clean dispersal this time . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Head ' em out ! First squad up , on-line . Hicks , get yours in a cordon . Watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move ! Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . Second squad , on-line . You set ? Go on . Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . Sir , you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . We got some explosive damages , probably seismic survey charges . Are you reading this ? Keep it tight , people . Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . OK , Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . Wait , tell him to ... Hicks , back up . Pan right . There . You seeing this ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you liked that , you 're gonna love this . Quit screwing around . Second squad , what 's your status ? We just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , we missed it . The area 's secured . Let 's go check their computer . - It 's not secure . - The area 's secured . First team , head for Operations . - Hudson , get their CPU on-line . - Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . He 's coming in . I feel safer already . Pendejo jerkoff ! Sir ... They sealed off this wing at both ends . Welded the doors , and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . - Any bodies ? - No , sir . Last stand . Must have been a hell of a fight . Yeah , looks that way . All right , Drake , this way . You should be able to cut through the med lab to Operations . Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones ? Careful , Burke . Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . Two are alive . The rest are dead . Surgically removed before embryo implantation . Subject : Marachuk , John J , died during the procedure . They killed him taking it off . Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . - Behind us . - One of us ? Apone , where are your people ? - Anybody in D-Block ? - Negative . We 're all in Operations . - Talk to me , Frosty . - Let 's keep moving , baby . - It 's moving . - Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . - Fuck ! - Hold up ! Ripley . Hey ... shh , it 's all right . - It 's all right . - Grab her , Corporal . Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . Shh ... it 's all right . It 's OK . Come on out . Come on . Easy , easy . I got her ! Ow ! Damn ! - Don 't let her go ! - She 's under the grill ! - Frost , get your light up here . - Where 'd she go ? Shine the light ! Down here . Here . Here . Keep back . Don 't scare her . - Grab her , man ! We 're gonna lose her ! - Damn it ! Wait ! It 's OK . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . See ? Wait ! No , you don 't ! It 's OK ! You 're gonna be all right now ! Shh ! Easy ! Easy ! It 's gonna be OK . It 's all right . You 're gonna be OK . Shh , shh , shh ! Easy . Easy . - What 's her name again ? - Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? Look , Rebecca ... Gorman , give it a rest , why don 't you ? Total brainlock . Physically she 's OK . Borderline malnutrition , but no permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting our time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . That good , huh ? I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it ! Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one , too . You don 't talk much , do you ? - Smoking or non-smoking ? - Just tell me what you 're scanning for . PDT 's . Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within 20 clicks , we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . I don 't know how you managed to stay alive , but you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . Newt . - What did you say ? - Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt . I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this ? Hm ? Casey . Hello , Casey . What about your brother ? What 's his name ? Timmy . Is Timmy around here , too ? Maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and Dad ? Newt , look at me . - Where are they ? - They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . Nice pet you got there . Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo ! Stop your grinnin ' and drop your linen ! Found ' em . They alive ? Unknown , but it looks like all of ' em over at the processing station sub-level three under the main cooling towers . It looks like a goddamn town meeting . Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . Let 's go , people . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Head ' em out ! OK , Frost , you 're driving . It 's OK . Don 't worry . It 'll be OK . I want a straight Vdeployment . Second team on left flank . Advance on axial six-six-four . Tracker on-line . Set the V-gain to filter R-F ambient . Hudson , tracker on-line . Left and right , little buddy . 40 metres in , bearing two-two-one , there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . You want sub-level three . Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . Check those corners . Watch your spacing . You heard the man . Don 't bunch up . Your transmission 's showing break-up . Probably getting interference from the structure . Use those lights . Next one down , and proceed on a two-one-six . Roger , that 's a two-one-six . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me , man . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember we 're looking for civvies in here . Easy . Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . Nice and easy . Looks like some sort of secreted resin . Yeah ... but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothing . Busy little creatures , huh ? - Hot as hell in here . - Yeah , man , but it 's a dry heat . Knock it off , Hudson . - Lieutenant , what do those pulse rifles fire ? - Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless . - Standard light armour-piercing round . Why ? - Look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So , if they fire their weapons in there , won 't they rupture the cooling system ? - Yeah . She 's absolutely right . - So what ? This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So she 's talking about a thermonuclear explosion and " Adiós , muchachos " . Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit ! Look . Uh ... Apone . Look . We can 't have any firing in there . I want you to collect magazines from everybody . - Is he fuckin ' crazy ? - What do we use ? Harsh language ? - Flame units only . - Sir , I ... Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . All right , sweethearts . You heard the man . Let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn ! You , too . Give it up , Ski . Crowe , I want it now . Give it up . Right on , Vas . Let 's go , Marine . Give it up . Frost , you got the duty . Open that bag . - Thanks a lot , Sarge . - Hicks , cover our ass . Head ' em out , people . I like to keep this handy , for close encounters . I heard that . Any movement ? Nothing . Zip . Holy shit ! Newt , go sit up front . Go on ! Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still Marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it moving . Easy . - Top ! - What ? We got a live one ! - You 're gonna be all right . - Please ... kill me . Stay calm . We 'll get you out . It 's gonna be all right . - We 've got to get her out ! - What is it , Dietrich ? Convulsion ! Dietrich , get back ! Get back ! No ! Frost , flamethrower ! Get back ! Flamethrower ! Move ! Movement ! What 's the position ? I can 't lock in ! Talk to me , Hudson ! Multiple signals ! They 're closing ! Go to infrared , people . Look sharp ! What 's happening , Apone ? We can 't see anything in here . Pull your team out , Gorman . I got readings in front and behind ! Where , man ? I don 't see shit . He 's right . There 's nothing back here . Something 's moving and it ain 't us ! Shit ! Tracker 's off-scale , man . They 're all around us , man ! Jesus ! Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . Frost ! Come on ! Jesus Christ , Apone ! What is going on ! Wierzbowski and Crowe are down ! Dietrich ! Crowe ! Sound off ! Frost ! Frost ! Wierzbowski ! Wierzbowski ! Let 's rock ! Yeah ! Who 's firing ? Goddamn it ! I ordered a " hold fire " . They 're coming out of the goddamn walls in swarms ! Uh , Apone , I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with ... Vasquez ! Drake ! Hold your fire ! Are you copying me ? Lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators , and fall back by squads . Say again ? All after incinerators . Lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators , and fall back ... Sarge ! Apone talk to me . Apone ? - Talk to me ! - He 's gone ! Get them out of there ! Now ! - Shut up ! - Hicks , whoever 's left , get the hell ... - Shut up ! - Goddamn it ! Where 's Apone ? ! Where 's Apone ? ! The Sarge is gone ! Let 's get the fuck out of here ! Let 's go , Marines ! Hudson ? Vasquez ? - Hudson , look out ! - Get it ! Hudson ! - Hicks ! Hicks ! - It 's too much ! Fall back ! I told them to fall back . - I told them to fall back . - They 're cut off ! Do something ! Fuck ! Keep movin ' ! Hold on , Newt . Ripley , what the hell are you doing ! Turn around ! That 's an order ! - Get off me ! - Goddamn it , that 's an order ! You had your chance , Gorman . Come on ! Come on , Drake ! Let 's move it ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! It 's blocked , man ! We got to go around ! Open the door ! Hicks ! Drake ! We are leaving ! Get them , Vas ! Run for it ! Shit ! - Let 's go ! - Drake , come on , man ! Drake , come on ! - No ! Fire in the hole ! - He 's gone ! - No ! Drake 's out there ! Put it out ! Drake 's coming ! He 's gone ! No , he 's ... not ! Forget him ! He 's gone ! Get on the goddamn door ! Eat this ! Ripley ! Go , go , go ! It 's all right ! We 're clear ! Ripley , you 've blown the transaxle ! You 're just grinding metal ! Come on , ease down . Ease down . Ease down ! Ease down . You OK ? I 'm all right . Get away from me , man ! - Lieutenant . - What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know ... Maybe a concussion . - But he 's alive . - No , man , he 's dead ! - Wake up , pendejo ! I 'm gonna kill you ! - Back off ! Right now . Somebody get me a first-aid kit . Hey . Hey , look ! The Sarge and Dietrich aren 't dead , man . Their signs are real low , but they ain 't dead . - Then we go back in there and get them . - I ain 't going back ! You can 't help them ! You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . Oh , dear Lord Jesus , this ain 't happening ' , man . This can 't be happenin ' , man . This isn 't happening ' ! We 've got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we roll them in there and nerve-gas the whole fuckin ' nest . It 's worth a try , but we don 't know if it 'll affect ' em . Let 's bug out and call it even . Why even talk about it ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . - Fuckin ' A ! - Hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it . They can bill me . OK , look . This is an emotional moment for all of us , OK ? I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments , please . This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with and I don 't think anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them . - Wrong . Yeah . Watch us . Maybe you aren 't up on current events , but we just got our asses kicked , pal ! Look , I 'm not blind to what 's going on but I cannot authorise that kind of action . Well , I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here . Corporal Hicks is ... This operation is under military jurisdiction . Hicks is next in chain of command . Am I right , Corporal ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . Look , Ripley , this is a multimillion-dollar installation , OK ? He can 't make that decision . He 's just a grunt . No offence . None taken . - Ferro , do you copy ? - Standing by . - Prep for dust-off . We need immediate evac . - Roger . On our way . I say we take off ... nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . Let 's go ! Pick it up , Hudson . Pick it up , baby . All right . Set him down here . Move it , Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . Hold on a second . There 's something ... Just get up here . I 'm in . Ramp closing . Spunkmeyer . Goddamn it . Well , where the fuck ... Run ! Well , that 's great . That 's just fuckin ' great , man . Now what the fuck are we supposed to do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now , man ! Are you finished ? You all right ? I guess we 're not gonna be leaving now , right ? I 'm sorry , Newt . You don 't have to be sorry . It wasn 't your fault . That 's it , man . Game over , man ! Game over ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? What are we gonna do ? ! Maybe we could build a fire , sing a couple of songs . Why don 't we try that ? We 'd better get back cos it 'll be dark soon , and they mostly come at night . Mostly . That 's everything , right ? This is absolutely everything we could salvage out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got 15 of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . - Is that the only flamethrower ? - Yeah . It 's only half full , but it 's functional . And another one 's damaged . I don 't know about that one . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 17 days . 17 days ? Hey , man , I don 't wanna rain on your parade , but we 're not gonna last 17 hours ! Those things are gonna come in here like they did before , and ... Hudson ! Hudson ! This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . Right ? - Why don 't you put her in charge ? - You better start dealing with it , Hudson . Listen to me . Deal with it , because we need you and I 'm sick of your bullshit . Now get on a terminal and call up a floor-plan file . Do you understand ? Construction blueprints . Anything that shows the layout . Are you listening ? Yeah . I need to see air ducts , electrical access tunnels , sub-basements every possible way into this complex . We don 't have much time . OK . - OK , I 'm on it . - Hudson ... Just relax . I 'll be in med lab . I 'll check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . So this service tunnel must be how they 're moving back and forth . Right . It moves from the processing station right into the sub-level here . Come down on that . OK , come over . Hold it . Go back . OK , punch that in right there . - No . It 's back here . - OK . Well , there 's a pressure door at this end . We could close that . Will that shut . That should hold for a while . Yeah , but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . That 's right , so we repair the barricades at these two intersections and weld plate steel over these ducts here , and here and here . Thet should seal off medlab and operations . - Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . All right , let 's move like we 've got a purpose . - Affirmative . - Affirmative . We 're sealing the tunnel ! Come on , baby . For what it 's worth ... Here , I want you to put this on . What 's it for ? It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex ... on this . It 's just a precaution . Thanks . Doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . All right , what 's next ? Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now you lie here and have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to . I have scary dreams . Well , I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nope . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her . Ripley , she doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry , Newt . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters . No real ones . But they are . Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Here . Take this . For luck . How 's that ? Don 't go ! Please ! Newt , I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera ? I can see you through that camera all the time , to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you , Newt . I mean that . That 's a promise . You promise ? I cross my heart . And hope to die ? And hope to die . Now go to sleep and don 't dream . Sneak . The molecular acid oxidises after the creature 's death , completely neutralising . Bishop , that 's interesting , but it gets us nowhere . I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with here . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists they move them over there and immobilise them to be hosts for more of these . Which would mean that there would have to be a lot of these parasites , right ? One for each colonist . That 's over a hundred at least . Yes , that follows . Each one of these things comes from an egg , right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . Bishop , I want these specimens destroyed as soon as you 're finished with them , is that clear ? Mr Burke gave instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs . He was very specific about it . Those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division . If you 're smart , we can both come out of this heroes and we will be set up for life . You 're crazy , Burke . Do you know that ? You really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past ICC quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it , Burke . From me . Just like they 'll know you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists . - Wait a second ! - You sent them to that ship . I just checked the colony log : Directive dated 6-12-79 , signed Burke , Carter J. You sent them out there and you didn 't even warn them . Why didn 't you warn them , Burke ? Ok , look . What if that ship didn 't even exist ? Did you think about that ? I didn 't know . So now if I make a major security situation out of it , everybody steps in and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . Nobody wins . So I made a decision and it was wrong . It was a bad call , Ripley . A bad call . Bad call ? These people are dead , Burke ! Have you any idea what you 've done here ! I 'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall . You won 't sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . Ripley . You know , I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . It 's very pretty , Bishop , but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . That 's beautiful , man . That beats it all . How long till it blows ? Four hours with a blast radius of 30 kilometres , equal to about 40 megatons . - We got problems . - I don 't fuckin ' believe this ! Vasquez , close the shutters . Why can 't we shut it down from here ? I 'm sorry , the crash caused too much damage . An overload was inevitable at this point . Oh , man ! And I was getting short ! Four more weeks and out . - Now I 'm gonna buy it on this rock ! - Hudson , give us a break ! Four more weeks . Oh , man ! We 've got to get the other dropship from the Sulaco . I mean there must be some way to bring it down on remote ? How ? The transmitter was on the APC ! It 's wasted ! I don 't care how , but we 'd better think of something ! Think of a way . Think of what ? ! We 're fucked ! We 're doomed ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? The uplink tower at the other end ? No , I checked . The hard-wiring between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Somebody has to go out there . Take a portable terminal , go on there and patch in manually . Oh , yeah , sure ! With those things running around ? You can count me out . - We can count you out of everything . - I 'll go . - Why don 't you go , man ? - I 'll go . - What ? - I 'll go . I 'm the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . Yeah , right , man . Bishop should go . Good idea ! Believe me , I 'd prefer not to . I may be synthetic , but I 'm not stupid . How long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly . 180 metres . - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there ... - Right . ... an hour to patch in and align the antenna 30 minutes to prep the ship , and about 50 minutes flight time . It 's gonna be close . - Good luck . - See you soon . Watch your fingers . Vaya con Dios , man . - I want you two walking perimeter . Hey , listen . We 're all strung-out shape . But stay frosty . And alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? 24 hours ? Hicks , I 'm not gonna end up like those others . You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? If it comes to that ... I 'll do us both . Listen , let 's just make sure it doesn 't come to that . All right ? All right . Hey , I wanna introduce you to a personal friend of mine . This is an M41-A pulse rifle , 10mm , with an over-and-under 30mm pump-action grenade launcher . Feel the weight . OK . What do I do ? - OK . Pull it in tight here . Right Lean into it . Now , it will kick some . Right . When the counter reads zero here ... - I press this up ? - That 's right . And get another one in quick . Slap it in hard . - Right . - Now you 're ready to rock ' n ' roll . - What 's this ? - That 's the grenade launcher . - I don 't think you wanna mess with that . - You started this . Show me everything . I can handle myself . Yeah , I noticed . - How do you feel ? - All right , I guess . One hell of a hangover . - Look , Ripley , I just want ... - Forget it . Excuse me . It 's OK . It 's OK . - Newt . Wake up . - Wha ? - Be quiet . We 're in trouble . Move , Newt ! Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Say again , Bishop . You 've got it into auto refuel mode , and it 's sequencing right ? - That 's right . - OK . Good . Stay on it . Get back to me when you 've activated the launch cycle . - He 's at the uplink tower . - Terrific . - Hicks ! Hicks ! Hicks ! - Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Help us ! Break the glass ! Break it ! Break it ! I 'll try . Ripley , I 'm scared . Me too . Stay here . - It 's the medlab . - Hudson ! Vasquez ! - Meet me in the medlab . We got a fire ! - We 're on our way . They 're coming , Newt . Shoot it out ! - Hudson ! - Jesus ! Christ , kid ! Look out ! - Over there ! - Yeah ! - Ready ? - Yeah ! Hudson ! - Yeah , all clear ! Nailed the other one . It 's history , man . Jesus ! Burke ... It was Burke . I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now ! It just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine if one of us was impregnated ... whatever you call it , and then frozen for the trip home . Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying . Me and Newt . - Wait a minute , now . We 'd all know . - Yes . The only way he could do it is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home . Namely yours . Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . Fuck ! He 's dead . You 're dogmeat , pal ! This is so ... nuts . I mean , listen ... listen to what you 're saying . It 's paranoid delusion . It 's really sad . - It 's pathetic . - You know , Burke , I don 't know which species is worse . You don 't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage . All right , we waste him . No offence . No ! He 's gotta go back ! - They cut the power . - What do you mean " they cut the power " ? - How could they cut it ? They 're animals ! I want you two with trackers , checking the corridors ! - Gorman , watch Burke ! Newt , stay close ! - I 'll go this side . - You do that , man . - Anything ? - Somethin ' . - It 's inside the complex . - You 're just reading me . No , no . It ain 't you . They 're inside . Inside the perimeter . They 're in here . Hudson , stay cool . Vasquez ? Hudson may be right . - Get back , both of you ! - The signal 's weird . Must be some interference or somethin ' . There 's movement all over the place ! Get back to Operations ! - It 's game time . - Newt ? Seal the door . - Hurry ! - Come on , get back ! Work fast ! Cover your eyes , Newt . Don 't look at the light . Movement . Signal 's clean . Range 20 meters . They 've found a way in . Something we missed . We didn 't miss anything . - 17 meters . - Something under the floor , not in the plans . - 15 meters . - Ripley ! - Definitely inside the barricades . - Let 's go ! - That 's right outside the door . Get back ! - Man , this is a big fucking signal . - How you doing , Vasquez ? Talk to me ! Almost there . That 's it ! 12 meters . 11 , 10 . - Then they 're right on us . - 9 meters . - Remember , short controlled bursts . 8 meters 7 ... 6 ... - Can 't be . That 's inside the room . - It 's readin ' right , man ! Look ! - Well , you 're not reading it right . Five meters , man . Four ... What the hell ? ! - Oh , my God . Oh , Jesus ! - Give me the light . There they go ! Over there ! Get ' em ! Come on ! Come on ! Look out ! Look out , there 's more of ' em ! Medical ! Get to Medical ! - Do it ! - Look out , Hudson ! Look out ! Now ! Burke ! Open this door ! Burke ! Open it ! Come on , let 's go ! Fall back ! - Go ! Die , motherfucker ! Burke ! Hudson ! Hudson ! Motherfucker ! Die , motherfucker ! Motherfucker ! Come on ! Come on ! Come and get it , baby ! Come on , you too ! You want some of this ? Fuck you ! Fuck you ! - Hicks ! Hicks ! - Hudson ! Come on , Hicks ! Go ! It 's locked ! Got it ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Move , Gorman ! Seal it ! Burke ! Goddamn you ! Open this door ! Get back ! - Hurry up ! - Gorman , get out of the way ! - Ripley , this way ! - What ? Wait . Get behind me . Whatever you 're gonna do , do it fast ! - Hicks ! - Come on , let 's go ! Move ! - Which way to the landing field ? - This way . Go right ! This way ! This way . - Which way ? - Straight ahead and left . Bishop , do you read me ? Come in . Over . The ship is on its way . ETA 16 minutes . Good ! Stand by there ! We 're on our way ! - Which way now ? - That way . - No , wait ! This way ! - Are you sure ? Vasquez , move ! - Right up here ! It 's just up here ! - Hicks ! We 're almost there ! Newt , wait ! Newt ! Vasquez ! Go ! Ohh ! Oh , ne ! Newt . Up there ! There 's a short cut across the roof ! Hicks ! You always were an asshole , Gorman . Newt ! Ripley ! - Newt ! Hicks ! Hicks , get her ! Hurry ! Oh ! Hold on , Newt ! - I 'm slipping ! - Don 't let go ! - Ripley ! - Hold on ! - Help ! - Gotcha ! I gotcha ! Newt ! No ! Come on ! We can find her with this ! Stay where you are , Newt ! - Ripley ! - We 're coming ! Ripley ! This way . She 's close . Newt ! Ripley ! Where are you ! Can you hear me ! - Newt ! - Here ! I 'm here ! Where ? ! Newt , are you OK ? Gonna have to cut it . Climb down , honey . We 've got to cut through . Newt ? Now don 't move . Stay very still . OK . We 're almost there . Hang in there , OK ? Hicks ! Hurry ! - I know ! - I mean it ! Newt , just stay still ! - Almost there ! - No ! Newt ! No ! No ! - Let 's go ! - No ! They don 't kill you ! They don 't kill you ! They ... - She 's alive ! She 's alive ! - All right ! I believe you ! She 's alive ! We 've got to go ! Now ! Hicks ... Get it off ! Here ! Go ! Come on , you can make it ! Bishop ! How much time ? ! Plenty ! 26 minutes ! - We 're not leaving ! - We 're not ? - Ripley ... - I don 't wanna hear that , Bishop , she 's alive . There 's still time . In 19 minutes this area is gonna be a cloud of vapour . - Hicks , don 't let him leave . - We ain 't going anywhere . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have 15 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have 14 minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Ripley ! Ripley ! Grab on to me ! Hold on ! Let 's go ! Behind us ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have four minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Come on , goddamn it ! Hold on to me ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance . No ! Bishop . Goddamn you ! Close your eyes , baby . Look ! Come on ! Come on ! Punch it , Bishop ! It 's OK . We 're OK . Hey . We made it . I knew you 'd come . He 's gonna be all right . He 's just out . I had to give him another shot for the pain . We need a stretcher to carry him up to medical . OK . I 'm sorry if I scared you . That platform was becoming too unstable . I had to circle and hope that things didn 't get too rough to take you off . Bishop ... - You did OK . - I did ? Oh , yeah . Go ! Move ! No ! Here ! Here ! Run ! Here ! Get away from her , you bitch ! Come on ! Come on ! Ripley ! Bishop ! - Mommy ! - Oh , God ! Not bad for a ... human . Are we gonna sleep all the way home ? All the way home . Can I dream ? Yes , honey . I think we both can . - Sleep tight . - Affirmative .

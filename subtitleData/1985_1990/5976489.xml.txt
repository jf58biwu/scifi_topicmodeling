 [ Theme music ] [ Music continues ] [ Plane droning ] Well , so far nothing 's blown up , caught fire or disappeared . Well , we 're not at the airport yet . Been in the jungle too long , Gerald . Much too long . Stop worrying . I 'll make you a deal . I 'll stop worrying if you stop being so nervous about facing your daughter . Are these artifacts really that important , Dean Thompson ? Oh , more than anyone could imagine . [ Camera clicking ] They 'll give us , they 'll give us new insight into the Mayan culture . We 're grateful that the authorities gave permission to Professor Lang , to take them out of the country . Lana , the beautiful . The jailbreakers are coming to town next Tuesday and knowing how you love rock and roll .. - How do you know what I love ? - Computers , my dear . My hard disk drive holds biographies of everyone at shuster . From president on down to the lowest of the frosh . It took a superhuman effort , but I have two tickets to the- - Lex , just keep your clammy hands off , okay ? Leo , she 's going to regret that . Nobody talks to the president of the senior class that way . - Nobody ! - You 're right , Lex . ( T.J. ) Hey , Lana . I know Lex Luthor goes way up the scale on the sleaze-o-meter , but .. He 's right . You dropped a bomb on him . He probably deserved it , but still .. So I was stupid . Just that , right now I 've got other things on my mind . It 's been two years since I 've seen him . [ Alarm beeping ] Approach , this is Nancy 9748 Charlie . I 'm having an emergency . Landing gear malfunctioning . ( Man on radio ) Roger , Nancy 9748 Charlie . Climb to 1500 feet and circle . [ sirens wailing ] [ Beeping continues ] Come on . [ Siren continues ] ( Man on radio ) Nancy 9748 Charlie , all traffic has been diverted . Maintain holding pattern . [ intense music ] ( Man on radio ) Nancy 9748 Charlie , maintain holding pattern . We have to land . You can 't land in your condition . I have no fuel . Don 't say a word , Gerald . Don 't say a word . ( Man on radio ) You cannot land in your condition . It 's certain disaster . [ theme music ] Superboy . [ Beeping continues ] [ Beeping stops ] ( Man on radio ) You can relax , folks . Malfunction repaired . Well , can 't win them all . ( Lana ) Daddy . Daddy , I was so scared . Would you believe it , the landing gear getting stuck ? We 're lucky we landed so safely . Oh , let me look at you , Lana . You have grown up so beautiful .. - Lana , it 's been- - - It 's been a long time . Figured it 's a major victory that you even recognize me . Gerald , would you try and find if those crates we sent from techacal have arrived ? Excuse me , Lana . I 'm sorry , but this is Gerald Haines my associate . He helped me discover the lost temple of techacal . - Hi . - My daughter Lana . Pleasure meeting you , Miss Lang . Nice meeting you . Well , I do have to go see about those artifacts on the plane . - Can he see to them ? - No , it 's my responsibility . You understand . I understand perfectly , Daddy . Clark , will you take me back to the dorm , please ? - Sure , you alright ? - Yeah . TJ , I 'm gonna take Lana back . It 's been titled as the find of the century , Leo . ( Leo ) No kidding . The Jewel of Techacal alone must be worth a million . - A million ? - Yeah . Some dumb old urn he 'd find in a dig always meant more to him than I did . Why do you say that ? Same with my mum . Ancient ruins , that 's what intrigued him . She stood it for ten years before she divorced him . Lana , every museum in the whole country wanted this exhibit and he-he came to shuster so he could be with you . It 's just guilt . Spasm of guilt which he 'll get over the moment he 's off on another two-year jaunt into history . Why don 't you give him a break ? I got to face it , Clark . Don 't you understand ? I 'm just a little footnote in his grand scheme of things . - Lana , he loves you . - Yeah . Right . Sure , but what are we gonna do about it ? You 're always coming up with ideas . Come up with one now . I 'd give my right hand for Lana but how are we gonna do a salvage job on a father-daughter shipwreck ? We have to find a way . How is this ? It 's perfect . [ Sighs ] - Good morning , Professor . - Good morning . ( TJ ) Good morning , Professor . That looks really great . - Mind if I take a shot or two ? - Not at all . Help yourself . Professor Lang , I don 't know if you remember me I 'm from Smallville , Clark Kent . I haven 't been back there in quite a while . I was this tall when Lana and I used to play . - You 'd come in to town and- - - You 're the Kent 's boy . - Of course I remember . - Yes , sir . Are you from Smallville , too ? Ha , ha . No , I , uh , I met Lana and Clark here at Shuster . TJ 's from Metropolis . His father 's editor of the Daily Planet . Nice to meet you . [ Intense music ] ( Clark ) Come on ! TJ , stay down . ( TJ ) Clark . Watch out ! ( TJ ) Professor Lang . Careful . [ Intense music ] Did you see that beam ? That could 've been a serious accident . It was no accident . It was a tornado , Gerald . It 's a season for them in this area . We were warned when we took the jewel . We desecrated the temple of techacal . What we did adds to the worlds knowledge . We should return the jewel . You need a rest , Gerald . You 're tired . Come on . Come on . [ Eerie music ] Lana ! Lana ! There you are . I 've left messages for you everywhere . At your dorm , at the coffee shop , with your friends . I got them all . Lana , your mother forgave me . Why can 't you ? I do . It 's just that , every time I see you and every time I 'm let down again . I wanna make it up to you . Why do you think I came to Shuster ? I don 't know . Why did you ? To open up lines of communication . Give me a chance . I wanna spend a lot of time with you . I wanna make up for all the lost time . Unless somebody discovers a lost temple that needs your expert supervision ? That 's not fair . Let me prove it to you . Alright . Let 's talk it over for dinner tonight . I can 't . Not-not dinner tonight . Lana , I .. Lana , the tornado , it caused such a havoc and network television is doing a feature on the exhibit . Gerald and I have to be there every minute from now on just to repair the damage , but then I 'm free . Daddy ... You shouldn 't have had a daughter . You should 've just had another relic . Lana , come to the interview with me . Right after that we 'll go anywhere . Just the two of us and we 'll talk for hours . We 'll talk for days if you want . ( Professor Lang ) Lana .. ... I love you so much . I doubt it . Nothing will stop us . I promise . Drive , Leo . I 'm sorry , Gerald , but I was held up . Not to worry . We 'll make your time . Dr. Lang , that is the first genuinely happy smile I 've seen on your face for a long time . Lana and I , Gerald .. ... I have a feeling everything is gonna be alright . Oh . Lang . Doctor Lang ! Somebody call an ambulance ! [ Beeping ] How is he ? I wish I could give you some good news , but .. ... we 've never experienced anything like this . Techacal . - He 's not going to- - - Shh . His vital signs are very weak . His pressure 's low , we can 't seem to raise it . and his heart .. ... there 's no signs of damage but .. ... we 're getting very little response . You 've gotta help him . Well , we 'll run more tests . ( Woman on p.A. ) Doctor Spencer . Doctor Paul Spencer , please . We 're doing everything we can , Miss Lang . Not everything .. The Jewel of Techacal . Did you really believe in this stuff , Mr. Haines ? It should have been returned . If only Superboy were here . Where 's the temple ? Even if you could find it , it 'd be too late . Not for Superboy . I-I might know how to get a hold of him . Lex , you 're great . The greatest . Didn 't I say Professor Lang was an immensely considerate person ? Think of the decency of the man , Leo . He became ill , so we could have a clear shot at this .. ... unguarded treasure . Beautiful . Absolutely awesome . Leo , I didn 't say considerate , did I ? I said the Professor was arrogant and insolent . Yes , that 's what you said , Lex . Arrogant and insolent . And he deserves everything I 'm going do to him . Like removing these priceless artifacts from his guardianship . And as for Lana .. ... the beautiful . Bringing that nasty nose of hers down into the dirt .. ... will be the greatest pleasure of all . Way to go , Lex . The frosting on my revenge , Leo .. ... will be the lovely profit I will realize from the sale of these trinkets . Especially , this gorgeous jewel . ( Leo ) Lex . Ah , the one they call Superboy . Why am I not surprised to find you here , Lex ? Could it be because you always have your greedy paws where they don 't belong ? Well put , Superboy . And might I add , we have here a once in a lifetime opportunity . Oh , what would that be , Lex ? If we pooled our talents , think of the heights we could climb . Think of the depths we 'd reach . [ Shrill squeal ] - What 's in the box , Lex ? - You surprise me . Surely a super person like yourself can see into a little old lead box . Conversation ended . I 'll take the box . Are you refusing my offer to merge ? - You 're quick , Lex . - Out of my way , Superboy . Permission granted . [ Grunts ] Superboy ? Superboy ? Superboy . What 's wrong ? Little curse of techacal got you ? - Lex , let 's get out of here . - Why hurry , Leo ? Think of the fun we 're all having . Right ? Superboy ? Leo , I do believe our hero has passed out . What if that thing turns on us ? That 's a thought , Leo . [ Lex laughing ] [ Beeping ] Daddy . - Lana . - Oh , Daddy , just .. Don 't try to talk . No , because I wanted you to know . All those birthday parties ... I missed and all the christmases that I wasn 't with you .. Daddy , just rest , please . No , but I ... I made it to your high school graduation . Yeah . It was wonderful . I haven 't been a very good father . No , I know that but .. I was gonna make it up to you .. Daddy . Daddy , please don 't die . Daddy ? Doctor . Doctor ! Daddy . Daddy . I love you . [ Melancholic music ] [ Thinking ] I must 've lost my strength . The jewel . It must have some power I don 't understand . Where are we headed , Lex ? Concentrate , Leo . This is the second time I 'm telling you . We 're on our way to an art dealer who doesn 't mind turning a dishonest dollar around . Alright . Lex ! Pull over . Pull over , Lex . [ Siren wailing ] [ Tires screeching ] - Are you alright ? - Yeah . What happened ? Look what you did to my sister 's car ! Leo , shut up ! I 'll buy her a better piece of junk . Officers . ( Superboy ) Officers , in the back of this car you 'll find artifacts stolen from the university . Stolen ! Preposterous . I don 't have time to watch you squirm your way out of this one . ( Male # 1 ) Well .. [ Thunder rumbling ] He 's recovering . I don 't know how it happened , but it 's happening . Thank you , Doctor . Ha ha ha . I never thought I 'd see you again . It 's some miracle , isn 't it ? No , Daddy . It 's Superboy . [ Both chuckles ] - He 's going to be alright . - Ah ! Thank heavens . Uh , Mr. Haines , if you could help me complete my records . Yeah . Hey , hey ! Superboy does it again , huh ? - Superboy ? Maybe . - What do you mean " maybe ? " He returned the jewel . Didn 't he got rid of the curse ? - Saved Professor Lang ? - Uh , Lana did . I like to think that love is a little stronger than magic or a curse or whatever . My money is still with Superboy . Speaking of Superboy , how about letting me in on just how you contacted him ? In case I see a building about to fall on a lady . And you 're not around to send him a flare . - Sure . Do what I do . - Uh-huh . Look in the yellow pages under S. [ Laughs ] [ Theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

 on Network 23 . Carter 's the best known reporter we have on the air . He satellites globally . Where does all this stuff come from , Bryce ? The components of Carter 's mind . M-M-Max , M-M-Max . [ Bryce ] People translated as data . It 's computer-generated , whatever it is . It looks like Edison . Max . Max Headroom . Max ? He 's a computer-generated person based on you . Two minds , but with one single memory . [ Woman ] Welcome to Ovu-Vat , and the new , safe trouble-free and painless way to have babies . For the new age of the new woman , the new childbirth . We make beautiful babies for the busy woman about Metropolis . There is no longer any need to suffer the inconvenience of childbearing . Let Ovu-Vat grow your babies . We do it perfectly no mistakes , no diseases . We come to terms with coming to term for you . Grow-bag your baby with Ovu-Vat . Special terms for twins . [ footsteps ] Time for your supper break , East ? Oh , no , Mrs. Firth , there 's 20 minutes . Time for your supper break , East . [ Woman ] You 're off early , East . [ Woman over P.A. ] All grow babies are in happy hour . No unauthorized staff are permitted in baby bagging area . All babies are synchronized to come to term between 8 : 00 a.m. and 10 : 00 a.m. Staffer requested to return to the Grow-Bag areas at that time . No staff allowed in this area at this time . [ Woman ] I must say , Edison Carter certainly has a great apartment . [ Man ] Yes , you can almost taste the taste . [ people chattering ] You know they hired a clairvoyant . I hope it 's not that man with a moustache . - Facial hair is so down-trending . - There she is . Well , I 'm glad you 're enjoying the party , Ashwell . Well , thank you , Ben . I must say your wife has a wonderful choice of caterers . - Yes , if you must . - Oh ! Excuse me . [ Woman ] My job is my life . My life is my career . My career is my world , and my world is network television . It 's the ultimate occupation . It is life . Still top network , but ratings are a passion for me in their own way , strangely seductive for their own sake . - The ebb and flow . - [ doorbell rings ] You look ravishing . Well , thank you , sir . - Hi , Helen . - Great you could get here . Who 's that girl in blue who just walked in ? - Helen . Great . - You know her ? Yeah . We lived together for years . - Helen ! - Laura , hi . Come and meet her . Give me a moment with Cheviot , and I 'll come and join you . Tell her I 'm a wonderful guy , though . Oh , no . I never tell lies . So what do you tell her ? You 're a wonderful guy . Perfect . - Ah , Carter . - Hello , sir . Murray here yet ? No , he went home to change . I 'm sure he 'll be here later on . [ both chuckle ] Good of you to let me use the place , Carter . - I wasn 't aware I had a choice . - [ doorbell rings ] Network politics . Our programming people felt that your home would be a more effective ratings puller than mine . Well , I 'm gonna need you in just a few minutes when we go live . - Hi . - Oh ! It 's really great to see you . I 'm so glad you could come . You look great . Oh , thank you . Oh , and I 've got such a lot to tell you . And some really big news . We 're live , everybody . [ Man ] Oh , here we go ! [ Male host ] Welcome to Cocktail Club , the show that takes you to the people 's parties , and lets you mingle with the famous , live . Tonight , we 're taking you to the home of Network 23 's personality Edison Carter , and the man who is Network 23 , our chairman , Mr. Ben Cheviot . - Good evening , Ben . - Good evening , Chuck . Happy you could stop by . Make yourselves at home . Well , Ben , you better move over , there 's 114 million of us . [ Female host ] Thank you , Chuck . Let 's leave Mr. Cheviot and his niece to enjoy the party . And there 's Edison Carter . This party at the home of the world 's most famous video journalist is indeed a glittering all-star occasion . And what a rare privilege it is to see the decision makers , television 's top people- - accountants , statisticians , and lawyers , and there may be a producer here somewhere . [ laughter ] I hate these corporate dos . I 'm sure you don 't- - you 're on screen half your life . The other half I like to reserve for meeting very beautiful friends of Theora 's . - Yes . - Oh , thank you . Edison , this is Helen . Helen , this is Edison . - Hello . - Hello . Um , drinks , what 'll it be ? - Soda water for me , please . - Champagne , please . What do you think this is ? [ Ben ] There 's somebody I want you to meet . Edison Carter , my wife Barbara . How do you do , Barbara ? I 've heard a lot about you . - Not too much I hope . - No , sir . [ Helen ] So what 's he like to work with ? Provoking , demanding , great fun . I love the job . But tell me about your news . Um , well , I 'm going to be a mother . Oh , Helen , that 's marvelous ! - When ? - Tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Wh-what ? No , Christopher and I went for baby bagging , darling . Oh . Ah , so you don 't approve . Look , it 's the most sensible thing for us to do . I mean , Christopher 's in orbit weeks at a time , and , well , I 'm at the studio , so when am I gonna find the time to be pregnant ? I suppose so . It just seems so impersonal . No , it 's not . We both went and became donors . The baby 's ours . It 's just that I don 't have to turn into a pumpkin to do it . Who 's turning into a pumpkin at midnight ? [ Boy ] ... is the correct answer ! Our ratings ! They 're all watching Prodigies ! What the hell are you doing ? Where 's our show gone ? Ben , look at the ratings . Nobody 's watching The Cocktail Club . What is the square root of 1,744 ? Move on to Max Headroom . I want him to take on Prodigies . He can take over 23 whenever Prodigies is on , with no holds barred . This is war , gentlemen . [ Man ] He 's setting Max Headroom against Prodigies . Now , let 's regroup our forces and get on with the party . This is your captain speaking . Dive , dive , dive ! Hold that order ! I hope that vessel is under command , Bryce . What ? Whoa ! Mission accomplished . One sub returned to base ! What do you want ? Bringing news from HQ , Bryce , my little admiral . I-I too have a mission , to take on the mi-mi-might of Network 66 . My mission is to sink the Prodigies show . - [ Max gasping ] - [ static ] [ phone beeping ] [ Woman 's voice ] Network 66 vidiphone control . Get me Grossberg . Good evening , Bryce . Interesting headgear . I 've been thinking about your offer . I want to come and talk . Shall we say 8 : 00 tomorrow morning ? Baby bagging sounds wonderful , Helen . I had no idea it was so popular already . It isn 't . We 're in the first batch . It 's really exciting . I suppose it must be clinically safe , but isn 't there something missing ? Yes- - pain , exposure to disease , and damage . Oh , and chance . We 're actually able to select the sex . No more sweet mystery , huh ? Oh , Mr. Carter , you 're a romantic . Would you mind if I came with you tomorrow ? I think I can persuade Cheviot to let me do a piece on the new childbirth . Oh , actually , I 'd appreciate it . I could do with the support . How about you , Theora ? I 'd love to , if can get it past Murray . [ Max ] Parents , parents , you can 't p-p-push your children too hard . It 's not exploy-ploy-ploytation . Breed a ch-champion . 10-year-old girls just love-love-love to have no friends . Go to bed at 8 : 00 , live on vitamins , and pound-pound-pound around a tennis court all day . And why ? Well , to make them happy , of course . - Good morning . - Morning . Why weren 't you at the party last night ? - Oh , you know what happened ? - What ? The power went out at my complex last night . I had to have Utililac over . No , you don 't like going to parties , Murray . Of course I like parties . Now , who says I don 't like parties ? [ Edison ] I don 't like parties . Excuse me . But ... I suffer them like a saint . You just haven 't perfected the art of the excuse . You don 't fool Cheviot , you know . He asked me where you were , and then he gave me one of his knowing looks , you know the ones that he does the ... ? Also , I ran a story idea past him , and he likes it . Baby bagging , the new childbirth . What 's new about childbirth ? I mean , I 'm the product of childbirth . Yeah , I know , but not like this . Parents donate egg and sperm , and they pop it in a bag , and then nine months later , unzip a kid- - no pain , no fuss . And you can specify what it 's like . Specify ? It is a baby . It 's not a barbecue pit . I must say I feel the same way . [ Edison ] Cheviot likes it . Kids are in . 66 is doing a whole thing about brilliant babies , called Prodigies . Now , we can poach some of their viewers . We can go for a core audience , Murray . Come on . - It 's a friend of Theora 's . - All right , all right . You already slid it past Cheviot . What choice do I have ? You gotta keep your finger on the pulse , Mur , go to these power parties . [ Edison chuckles ] - Let 's go . - Cover me . - Got it . - [ Max ] Yes , here I am on Net-Net-Network 23 , to give you my own show . Nothing big , nothing special , just a hum-hum-humble little thing modestly entitled , me , M-M-Max Headroom , the original prodigy . [ Pilot ] Chopper 69 and 23 , Control . [ Control ] This is 2369 . I have you going down at Ovu-Vat Pad 1 . Confirm on contact . [ Pilot ] Roger , 23 . Going down . [ Edison ] Control , camera check , please . I can handle it . Come on . It 's an interview , not a crisis . [ Edison ] Helen Zeno , why did you decide to use this new method of childbirth ? Well , my husband Christopher and I are just too busy with our careers . But more important , this system at Ovu-Vat removes the hassles of childbirth for mother and child . So , you see , those first few months are critical , that is , when everything can go wrong . [ static ] [ Edison ] Excuse me . I have a problem , Control . - Update , please . - I don 't know . Um ... Dung ? Come on , Murray , she 's about to get the baby . We need the payoff , for God 's sake . What the hell 's going on ? Uh , I think it 's- - I think it 's coming from your end , Edison , I think . Poor old boy 's past it . [ Theora ] Edison , get the spare from the chopper . Okay , Cont- - I thought that link was a little clearer . So how long 's he gonna take ? Only 10 minutes , maybe less if they line up quickly . That 's no good . I can 't wait , The . But he can catch us grinning afterwards , okay ? - Okay . - Nurse ? Is it over ? Oh . I wanted his autograph . No , no , don 't worry . He 's coming back . It 's just that I couldn 't wait . I want to see her now . Of course you do . Come on , you know the way . - Oh God , I 'm so excited . - Here we are . Oh , she 's just gor- - Oh , my God . Uh-oh , trouble . [ Man ] Let 's get quietly out of here . Where 's my baby ? Don 't tell me my child was never here . I visited her two days ago . Mrs. Zeno , I 'm sure there is a simple explanation about all of this . Look , this baby came to term at 7 : 00 last night . - Now , where is she ? - There 's been a mix-up . Someone else has got her . No , no , I assure you , that can 't happen . Look , I 'll get Cornelia Firth . She 'll sort this all out . [ Helen ] Yes , you do that . What the hell has gone wrong ? Come on . Come on , Helen . No , I want Lydia . I want my baby . Helen , please . You have seen something . There 's nothing we can do . I want to get to Edison . He 'll know what to do . What was going on back there , Cornelia ? A bit of extremely bad timing . [ girl chattering ] [ man laughing ] Bryce , welcome . Come and join me . I 'm watching our fine Prodigies show . Yeah , I was hoping we could talk . I have news of Max Headroom . Of course you do . He 's set opposite my Prodigies show . How astute of your boss , Cheviot . Or should I say ex-boss , hmm ? Well ... that 's what I wanted to talk to you ... about . Well , now , boys love water , don 't they ? Even brilliant ones , I dare say . Mr. Grossberg , we have a terrible problem . - The woman 's whose baby- - - Shut up . Bryce , hop along and change , won 't you ? Now , what is it ? [ Edison ] Helen , what 's the matter ? What 's going on ? Where 's the baby ? Let 's get Helen home , my place . We 'll talk on the way . It was fortunate that Edison Carter left before the incident . Why was I not told ? I have no idea . Parker was supposed to have told you- - Last one to the other side of the pool 's a genius . Well , this is my proposition . I 'm about to offer you the very best job in network television . This is a matchless opportunity , Bryce . You are about to be amazed . Those men knew the baby was gone . I mean , everybody else was as shocked as we were , but those two men knew . But knew what ? If the child were dead , they would 've told her . What if there 's something wrong with it ? Yeah , it could be . But why wouldn 't they tell Helen ? They wouldn 't just let her walk out like that . Not with me outside . I think they thought you 'd already left . My God , what if there 's something terribly wrong with the baby ? No , there 's nothing wrong with her . Oh , Helen , I 'm sorry . I was just thinking what could 've happened . Two days ago , the child was perfect . I saw her . She was beautiful . That 's the whole point of baby bagging . The genes are checked at conception . No inherited problems are possible . Which leaves one clear possibility . My daughter was stolen . Control to Edison Carter . Come in , please . Damn , this idiotic computer . Who set this thing up ? - [ computer rings ] - [ Edison ] Murray , is that you ? - Yes . - What are you doing ? I 'm getting crazy signals . I 'm going crazy . Where are you ? Where 's the rest of the show ? We 're at Theora 's apartment . I 'm gonna put you on the view-phone . For what ? What happened to the greatest show since Adam and Eve shut down Standards and Practices ? We think the baby was stolen . Well , why aren 't you chasing it ? That is a story . We do stories , remember ? A stolen baby is great . Murray , Helen , the baby 's mother is here . [ Murray ] Oh , God , I 'm sorry , I had no idea . Look , we need help . I want you to meet me at Ovu-Vat . Take a chopper to Pad 135846 East , - and wear a suit . - A suit ? Theora , what do you think about being a mother ? Um , not this morning , thanks . Edison Carter to Control . I 'm on my way to Ovu-Vat . Have you accessed the computer files on the building yet ? [ Control ] Almost . I hope it 's what you need . There 's a maintenance tunnel which carries the computer mainframe cables . The entrance is discreet . Graphics upcoming now . [ Theora ] Looks like Murray found a suit . [ Edison ] Yeah , too bad it isn 't his . [ Theora ] Oh , dear , he doesn 't look like a happy soldier . [ Edison ] Okay , let 's go . What if they recognize her ? Murray , they won 't recognize me . Those nurses will be off duty by now . It 's really not a problem . Come on . No ! Dung has accessed the building 's computer lines , and I 'm gonna try and go and get their files . Murray , you have to help Theora . We need to find out who 's running this place , exactly what 's happening in there , anything to try and help find Helen 's baby , all right ? - No ! - What is it , really ? - Really ? - Yeah , really . Really ? I 'm terrified of hospitals . Do you know what they make men do in those places ? Why are men so infantile about biology ? I mean , mine is much more of a nuisance than yours , and I never complained . - Come on . - Here . - What ? - Keep in touch with me on that . - What is this ? - Go on . [ Theora ] Now , this won 't hurt . You 'll just have to be a big boy . Helen Zeno , I am Dung Po , a fellow controller of Theora 's . I have Mr. Zeno for you on OrbitLink . A gesture courtesy of Network 23 . Helen , hello . SkyRig 17 to Ground Control . Christopher ? Hello . This is wonderful . I know . Proud father time . Well , is it a girl or a girl ? Um ... Do come in . - Now , is this your first ? - [ Edison ] Murray , can you hear anything ? Is your husband a little deaf , dear ? I mean , it 's often the way with the older man . A little , but everything else is in working order . Good . Now , proclivities . By the way , have we met , Mrs. Murray ? No , I 'm sure we haven 't . - Now , we 'd like a girl . - Right . Sex : Female . We can choose the sex ? Oh , hormonal and sex gene isolation are very common . I mean , none of the old guesswork . - And none of the surprise . - [ Edison ] Murray . Yeah , I-I hate this . I don 't feel well . How very male of you . Look , it this is all too much , we do have a male counselor . Good . Where ? Well , he 's upstairs in Suite D , as in diaper . Aren 't men sensitive little primitives ? Okay , Dung . Find the next one . Ahead , then right . Maintenance tunnel . The computer port outlet is 50 meters . Got it . [ Woman on P.A. ] Grow Baby 74 coming to term in four minutes . This is a four-minute warning . Grow Baby 74 . Edison ? Murray . Come in , please . Cornelia 's furious . Don 't interrupt . We know babies . This was quite unnecessary . You should have informed them that they are- - How this will affect the in vitro project I don 't know . We 'll probably have to accelerate it . I 'm having a nightmare . And our prenatal embryonics and supernatal environments are world class , too . What about post-natal ? I mean , you never mix babies up , do you ? Oh , no , of course not , dear . No , your little genius will be very safe with us . Now , let 's find your husband , shall we ? Edison , come in , please . E- - So I 'll see you next week , all right ? - Thank you so much . Bye-bye . - Thank you . Bye-bye . I 'm sorry about the delay , Mr. Bartlett , but as you saw , I had a couple of clients . - Very odd couple . - Uh , Ms. Firth- - I mean , he looked old enough to be her father . We can go along to filing and get that deal set . Ms. Firth ! They weren 't clients . They work for Edison Carter . Oh , my God . Okay , so what now ? I don 't know . Edison will find something , if there is anything . I 'm going back to Control . Well , I 'd like to go back to my apartment . I think I should tell Helen what 's happening personally . Well , tell her there is nothing happening personally . The baby 's probably having its gene template quality matched or some such nonsense . Look , Cornelia Firth runs the place , right ? Mm-hmm . And she was obviously not uptight , so it 's all standard procedure , really . What do you think Edison 's doing ? I have no idea . Probably dancing with the nurses . Come on . They just don 't understand . 23 gives me no support . They screw up my schedule . They change their targets . And to cover their own incompetence , they blame me . My checks are always wrong and late . I can never park . And now they 're denying me my parrot on cost grounds . Oh , they just don 't understand . They never do , Bryce . But I have something special . You 're familiar with our Prodigies program ? Brilliant babies . Brilliant . - What I want you- - - [ phone rings ] Mr. Bartlett for you , sir . [ ring ] Yes ? What is it ? They have just been here . You know who they are . We have nothing to hide , Bartlett . What on earth is the matter with you ? Where were we ? - Brilliant babies . - Yeah . Paging Cornelia Firth . Paging Cornelia Firth . Please contact security immediately . Someone 's in the system . Damn , it 's those two from Channel 23 . - [ Man ] Security . - Hello , security . We have a hacker in the system . Trace indicated Port 17 . Use the stun gun . Zeno . Got it . - Did she say what it was ? - A hacker . But how could he get inside ? There . That 's him . Hey , you ! We 're armed ! We 're licensed to stun ! Freeze ! Move it , move it ! This stun gun is charged ! Stay where you are ! You 're about to get the shock of your life , pal . That 's Edison Carter , our friend , see ? You caught him ! Get him , Grimes ! Get him ! Get that baby out of here . But why ? Ms. Firth , what is going on here ? [ Dung ] Edison , go right . Go the other way- - left . No . Point your camera . [ Edison ] Get me out of here ! These guys mean business . They 've got a stun gun . What the hell 's going on here ? Edison 's in trouble . He 's in a tunnel with many men , and they 've got stun guns . God , there are dozens of them . No ! Wait . Control . Control . Control , you 've cut me off . I can 't hear you . Where the hell am I ? Theora , Edison 's in trouble . I 'm punching an emergency patch through to you . Okay , don 't touch anything . Clear the keyboard . Murray , get off . Okay , Edison , this is Control . Theora , thank God . Right , now , along the tunnel , right at the end , there 's a small store room . I want you to go up the ladder and wait there . There 's a hatch . Stun guns wasn 't part of the deal . Yeah , I know it . Somebody let the situation deteriorate to a disaster . Okay , I 'm accessing the isometrics of the exit . Wait my command at the door . You 're all clear . Go . Uh , g-go back . It 's okay , Control . Thanks . Where am I ? You 're right by the file room . - Do you still need it . - Yeah . [ Helen ] You 're right , Theora . So what is it they don 't want me to know ? That 's exactly what Edison 's about to find out . Go , Edison . As you see , Bryce , the facts speak for themselves . It 's an impressive package . Mega-creds up from 23 . Naturally . I want you badly . I spared nothing to achieve this . Now I just need a peerless mind , a top man . You . [ Bartlett ] Mr. Breugal , I have a job . I 'm listening . Can you move a baby from Ovu-Vat ? Yes , sir . I can do that right away . You must be discreet , very discreet . This must be done with great discretion , Mr. Breugal . Discretion is our trademark . Theora , this is very interesting . Helen has a huge IQ . Oh , Christopher 's is pretty impressive , too . I 'm in a special file reference . That 's what I call a special baby . Theora , Helen 's kid is brilliant . Has an enormous IQ . You 're familiar with Prodigies . The whole world has become fascinated by these brilliant infants . They are a television phenomenon , Bryce . Tiny infants with great minds . They mesmerize even the stupid . The show has surprise , shock , pace , and huge cash stakes . I 've accomplished the impossible , Bryce , and replaced mindless action with fascination . And we have a hit . Wait . You want me to go on this show ? No , Bryce , no . You 're too old . No , I want you to form a team of the most brilliant minds in network television . Oh , now , isn 't that a contradiction in terms ? It always has been , but not now . I want 66 to develop a cutting edge in television thinking . New technology , new shows , advanced technique . And I want you , Bryce Lynch , to make television history . I can get as many of these babies as I want . They will be your team , unique and brilliant . But wait . What about my work in development over at 23 ? Bring it with you . You can even bring your greatest triumph- - Max Headroom . [ Max ] What I need to know is why does sex cause so much dis-dishonesty ? Why do couples say they 're go-going in for a baby ? A baby might be the end result , but it 's the last thing they think about when- - [ sound off ] Why not , Bryce ? The time is right . It 's your next step . Why don 't you just call Mr. Cheviot and say goodbye ? This is weird . I don 't get this . Show me . What do you think ? Babies without parents ? How can you have babies without parents ? Seem damn good at achieving parents without babies . - How long will this take ? - Oh , minutes . As soon as I get the file , I 'll print your specification copy , erase the file , and then the Zeno baby problem will cease to exist . Here we go , Mr. Breugal . Cootchie-cootchie . He 's in trouble . Theora , in vitro- - that 's another term for genetic engineering , right ? Yes . Reproduction in a laboratory environment . - Oh , my God . - Exactly . They 're reproducing babies from donors without their knowledge . Good God . This is a baby production unit . And they 're just reproducing the brilliant babies . Ah . Efficiency . Already selected . Well , come on . Hurry . I 'm very worried . We had no idea you were substituting these babies . Relax . Very soon we won 't need to . Trust me . I really wouldn 't reach for that phone because I 'd have to stop you . And believe me , after what I 've just learned , it would be a pleasure . Mr. Bartlett . Network 66 . What are you doing here ? Making babies , too ? Infant prodigies , perhaps ? 66 had nothing to do with this , I swear . Shut up . Tell me exactly what you know about in vitro babies and exactly what 's happened to the Zeno baby . [ baby cries ] [ laughter ] [ Grossberg ] Ratings , Chuck . Excellent . Prodigies is a hit , a palpable hit . Well , Bryce ? Well , uh , it 's rather trivial . I can see its potential . It 'll need some direction . Are those , uh , expensive to obtain ? Yes . Our sources charge a huge commission , and the parents are equally greedy . But one must feed the greedy . They appreciate it . Have you made your decision , Bryce ? [ speeded-up voices ] Zik-Zak ! Zik-Zak ! [ Helen ] I 'm not sure I can take much more of this . Look , what do you think they 're doing with her ? I don 't know . But if Network 66 is involved- - I mean , they can 't do anything terrible . They just daren 't risk it , Helen . It 's okay . - [ Edison ] Control . - [ Murray ] We 're here . Aren 't you getting a bit old for this ? Uh , Theora says I 'm still in working order . It was a joke . Remember those ? Tell me one . I just destroyed Ovu-Vat 's file system . I think that 's pretty funny , given what they 're doing there . Now how are we going to handle this ? I don 't know . Mr. Carter was very thorough . What about the parents ? You leave it to me . Now we 've still got time to make the switch . Switch ? What on earth do you mean ? Oh , my God . You mean that woman doesn 't know . On behalf of Network 66 , I insist on knowing what 's happening . Ms. Firth ! [ Cheviot ] Grossberg ? He 's offered you a job ? But you can 't accept . Bryce , you know he can 't be trusted . Look , I don 't care what he 's promised you . I 'll give you even better equipment than he will . And I 'll never lie to you in meetings again . And you can have your parrot back . Two parrots . I must consider my work . And this is a prodigious offer . I really feel I must take it . Goodbye , Mr.- - Goodbye , Ben . We 've captured our fish . Listen to me . Edison Carter has just been here . He knows about the Zeno baby . Knows what about the baby ? That it 's going to the Prodigies show . There has been an administrative error , but you see , Carter is building it up to make a story for Network 23 . Very well . Very well . I think I should let him feel very welcome . Perhaps two birds with one stone , eh ? Chubb , call security . They are to allow Edison Carter to enter the network with no resistance whatsoever . Understood ? Yes , perfectly . Bryce , are you hungry ? Control , I 'm at Network 66 . I have your picture , Edison . But I can 't hack into 66 securicams . Their system 's too tight . It 's okay . They just let me walk in here . What ? Okay , rotate your cam 180 degrees . I 'll watch your back . Boy , the place Grossberg 's got here . I 'm almost at the boardroom . It 's very conveniently sign-posted . But nobody 's following you . It must be a set-up . There 's no way that Grossberg would allow you in . I know , Control . It 's too late now , though . I 'm already there . Welcome . I was tempted to say something like " So we meet again , Mr. Carter , " but I won 't . Please do come in . I thought reptiles let their food rot before eating it . Please , Mr. Carter , let 's at least be civilized . After all , we 're here to parlay a truce . Neither of us has waved the white flag , so let 's consider this neutral territory . And let 's do behave appropriately . Be seated . Ready to go live and direct , Control . [ Theora ] Control 23 , we 're ready to go live . Where 's the Zeno baby , Grossberg ? Always so alive and so direct . Have it your way . Damn it , Carter , get this together ! You are here at my request . You 'll be safe as long as I decide . Only that- - Camera or no camera , you don 't stand a prayer . So ... let 's negotiate , hmm ? Zeno baby ? Safe and well . Let 's just pray to God that it stays that way . I love babies . They 're so sweet , especially with pickles . Now , the infant 's future isn 't in my hands , Mr. Carter . You shall decide its fate . [ Edison ] Then neither of us can afford to make a mistake . Precisely . Now , Bryce here has decided to accept my offer to work for me , and we have offered the parents of the brightest babies at Ovu-Vat a chance for their spectacular infants to form a team under Bryce . 66 will benefit , they will benefit , and I don 't see anything wrong with it . Stealing babies ? Not true . The Zeno baby incident was an error by Ovu-Vat . And I intend to return it to its owners- - its parents- - as soon as possible . So you see , there 's no problem . Ah . Edison , please , everything 's okay . Mr. Grossberg has explained everything very satisfactorily . You see , you 've mistaken me . You know , Edison , you and I could work together . You , me , Bryce , and , of course , Max Headroom . [ Grossberg chuckles ] What do you say ? Quite a team , eh ? Who knows ? It may even revise your opinion of me . I think I have mistaken you , Mr. Grossberg . Ned . Mind if I call you Ned ? I think you 're right . I think we could make quite a team . Should we make it official ? [ Grossberg ] Excellent . This has got to be stopped . On camera . Perfect . Ready to go live and direct , Control . Standing by , Edison . Now tell me what you know about the in vitro experiment at Ovu-Vat . And how Network 66 is manufacturing babies from donors without their knowledge . Your illegal cloning experiment , Mr. Grossberg . What ? In vitro cloning ? I know nothing of this . You must be crazy , Carter . It 's all here , Grossberg . Ovu-Vat is about to begin the in vitro project . Now where else would the little test tube geniuses go but here ? to Prodigies ? Carter , I swear to you on our ratings I know nothing of this , nothing . If that 's true , call them off . Chubb , get rid of the security . Now ! Away ! Well away ! For God 's sakes , Carter , you 've got to believe me . What you speak of is even beyond me . Good God . I believe you 're telling the truth . Murray , did you get all that ? Yes , I did , Theora . Okay , I 'm patching back to you . You have control . Just don 't touch anything . Your move , I think . I propose a deal . If you return the Zeno baby to me , I 'll not link you to the Ovu-Vat cloning story . I believe you knew nothing about it . But Ovu-Vat will be ruined , as will your genius baby scheme . You won 't be needing Bryce . Why should I trust you ? I gave you my word . Executives know a man 's word is his bond . More to the point , you have no choice . Did you get all that , Control ? [ Murray ] Loud and clear and recorded . Then we have a deal . Come on , Bryce . Let 's get you out of the fire and back into the pan . Once upon a time , there was a company called Ovu-Vat full of very smart people . They knew all the secrets of natal engineering . If you wanted the best for your new baby , Ovu-Vat was the place for you . Ex-utero , in vitro- - they had Latinate options galore . Their motto was " We take the guesswork out of having children . " But the very smart people at Ovu-Vat didn 't realize that after a certain point , progress becomes convenience , and that when you change the mysterious process of childbirth into just another labor-saving activity , you lose part of what makes you human . I suppose you could design a female baby X. I guess you could even pick one off the rack , charge it to your credit tube , and take it home . But you can 't design or sell a beautiful little girl named Lydia Zeno . You can only love her . Aw- - Aw . [ giggling ] S-S-So sweet . And- - And if you felt even slightly queasy over that-t , what 's coming after the break will really make you- - thrilled . Wait ! Wa-Wait ! Here they come , back- - back again for just one-one-one more meaningless little scene that 's only there to keep you watching through the commercials . New television . Ha ! Ha ! This show 's getting just like all the others . Uh , we 've been caught . Orbiting linkup for Helen Zeno . What ? Christopher ? Go ahead now , Commander Zeno . You are linked . Helen , she 's perfect . I knew you were fussing over nothing . Listen , they 've given me paternity leave . The shuttle 's on its way . Oh , I can 't wait to see you . Isn 't this great ? [ Edison ] Yeah , it 's great , but why is your husband in a washing machine ? Yes- - Yes , that really added something to the story , didn 't it ? So let me just remind you of what this terr-terr - terribly complicated story was all about- - reproduc-uction . You see , God may have made man in His own image , but woman He definitely made from a do-it-yourself kit . All those valves , buttons , nozzles- - all that just for producing children . And half the time , they don 't work-k-k , which is why He probably created gynecologists very shortly afterwards . There must be an easier way . He got it right with birds . They just lay eggs , and they 're happy . They sing-sing-sing all day . No , there 's just too many things that can go wrong with women , and that 's the point- - woman was an acc-acc-acc-accident . He was actually trying to design a c-c-car , which is why His German one turned out to be fast and efficient , His Japanese one small and neat , and His American one big , noisy , and more temperamental than all the others . Well , anyway , must go . My date 's arrived . Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services , Inc . Burbank , CA

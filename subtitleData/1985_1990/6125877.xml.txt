 This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf . The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak . The only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew . The most interesting event that happened recently was that Lister pretended he 'd passed the chef 's exam , although really he failed . That gives you some idea of how truly exciting some days can be around here . Holly , give me access to the crew 's confidential reports . Those are for the Captain 's eyes only Arnold . Fine . We 'll give him ten seconds to come back from the dead , and if he hasn 't managed , then we 'll presume I 'm in charge . No , he hasn 't managed it . Whose do you want ? Give me ... Give me Lister 's . Just the remarks . David Lister , technician , 3rd class . Captain 's remarks - " Has requested sick leave due to diarrhea " on no less than 500 occasions . " Left his previous job as a supermarket trolley attendant after ten years " because he didn 't want to get tied down to a career . " Promotion prospects - zero . " I always liked Captain Hollister . Such a great reader of men was Captain Hollister , A marvelous , marvelous man , and a tragic loss to us all . All right , Holly , give me ... give me mine . Arnold Rimmer , technician , 2nd class , Captain 's remarks - " There is a saying among the officers . If a job 's worth doing , it 's worth doing well , " If it 's not worth doing , give it to Rimmer . " He aches for responsibility but constantly fails the engineering exam . " Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Holly , Holly ... I want MY report , Rimmer . Two Ms. E-R " Astoundingly zealous . Possibly mad . " Probably has more teeth than brain cells , " Promotion prospects - comical , " No , no , no Holly . I want " Rimmer . " That 's two Rs : one at the front , one at the back . Arnold , this is your report . I always hated that pus-head Hollister . He always resented my popularity . That 's why he never put forward my proposal to reduce the minimum haircut length by an eighth of an inch . Small-minded , petty-thinking modo . Arnold , I 'm picking up an unidentified object , " Constantly fails the exam " ? I 'd hardly call 11 times " constantly " . I mean , if you eat roast beef 11 times in your life , one would hardly say that person constantly eats roast beef . No , it would be a rare , nay , freak occurrence . " Possibly mad " ? ! What is he driveling about ? It 's on the screen , Arnold . What is ? The UO . What is it ? I don 't know . Well , you 'd better find out , hadn 't you ? It 's obviously beyond me . I 've got more teeth than brain cells , remember ? Yes , you have . Would you like some toast ? Uh-uh . Some nice hot crisp brown buttered toast ? Uh-uh . You don 't want any toast , then ? No . What about a muffin ? Nothing . You know the last time you had toast ? 18 days ago . 11 : 36 . Tuesday the 3rd . Two rounds . Shh ! I mean , what 's the point of buying a toaster with artificial intelligence if you don 't like toast ? I do like toast . I mean , this is my job ! This is cruel . You 're just cruel . I 'm busy . Oh , you 're not busy eating toast , are you ? I don 't want any ! I mean , The whole purpose of my existence is to serve you with hot-buttered scrummy toast . If you don 't want any , then my existence is meaningless ! Good . I toast , therefore I am . Will you shut up ? What are you doing ? I 'm reading . What , with your nose ? Yeah , it 's a cat book . They don 't use marks , they use smells . You run your nose along the line and all different smells are released . It 's really good . What a pathetic idea . Well , yeah , unlike you Rimmer , my mind is open to new cultures , new ways of looking at and doing things . And what does it say ? It says , " See Dick run . " Run , Dick , run . " Run ... home , Dick . " That 's the cat equivalent of Shakespeare , is it ? Shakespeare ? Who 's Shakespeare ? You moron . A playwright in the olden days . Wilfred Shakespeare . I 'm only just starting out . This is for three-year-olds , so you should try it . I 'm not the slightest bit interested in smelling anything cats have to say . Thank you Lister . You don 't know what you 're missing . Rimmer , there 's this brilliant one when Dick buys this ball ... this big ball ... this big red ball . It 's amazing stuff . You ought to try reading your shirt sometime Lister . It 's probably a novel by Victor Hugo . Anyway , if you 're interested , Holly 's spotted ... Is that my shirt ? Yeah . I borrowed it . What 's that down the front ? That 's definitely biscuit . Erm , that 's custard ... That 's definitely ink ... and just general sort of dirty marks . You can 't just go through my possessions ! Come on , you don 't need them anymore . Because I 'm dead ? Yeah . You 're a hologram and holograms don 't need clothes . They 're mine things Lister ! Would you steal verruca cream from a man with no feet ? I mean , how would you like it if I stole your T - shirt , your favorite one with the custard stains down the front ? I wouldn 't care . You 've got no right to go through my wardrobe . OK , OK . You keep your underpants on coat-hangers , don 't you ? That 's private ! OK , Rimmer , OK . Take the shirt back . I don 't want it . It 's ruined . You 've sweated in it . Well if you don 't want the shirt , what DO you want Rimmer ? Just keep out of my things , alright ? OK , OK . What 's Holly spotted ? An unidentified object . You mean a rock . It might not be . They 're always rocks . Mostly they are rocks , I agree , but maybe this one 's different . Rimmer , there 's nothing out there you know ? There 's nobody out there . No alien monsters , no Zargon warships , no beautiful blondes with beehive hairdos , who say , " Show me some more of this Earth thing called kissing . " It 's just you , me , the Cat and a lot of floating , smegging rocks . That 's it . Finito . Lister , if there 's no one out there , what 's the point in existence ? Why are we here ? Beats me . You want some toast ? Arnold , the unidentified object is now in visual range , All right , Holly . I 'm on my way . Aow ! Nice jump . Hey ! Smooth with a capital " SMOO " . OK , time to get out the food detector . This way . Aow ! Ooh ! Yeah , yeah ! This way . Aow ! This way ! Ah , you . Where have you been ? Investigating . Investigating this , investigating that . General investigation . General investigation , eh ? Ah , splendid ! Keep it up . OK . Fine . Well , if you 'll just excuse me ... Hey ! You can 't have my shiny thing ! I found it , it 's my shiny thing . What are you driveling about ? This ... is my shiny thing . And if you try and take it off me , I may have to eat you . It 's a yo-yo , you modo . It does two amazing things . One , you have the shiny thing at the top , and the string down below , or , and this is the clever part , you have the string at the top , and the shiny thing down here where the string used to be ! Wowee ! You haven 't the slightest clue what it 's for , do you ? Why sure I do , grease stain ! You hold the shiny thing in one hand ... and you go ... Aow ! The string 's moving ! Hey ! Stop that string ! Catch that string ! Where is it ? It 's in scoop range , Arnold . It 's a pod ! Holly , bring it in ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! I 'm back ! Feeling good ! Feed me . Cat , hi . I haven 't seen you for ages . Where 've you been ? Investigating . Got you some crispies ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Hey , I read the book you gave me , you know . It 's got a brilliant ending . I could hardly believe me nose . Forget that . Got you this . The one you asked about . The Holy Book . Oh , great ! Hey ! Pictures ! Yeah ! That 's a cat thing . You see , sometimes in a book , we have a drawing of something that is happening in a story and we call them " pictures . " Yeah , yeah . We have pictures , too . Hey , you monkeys are smarter than I thought . This is me ! No , that 's not you . That 's Cloister . He was the father of the cat people . He lived years ago , at the beginning . Who 's that ? That 's him frozen in time . No , that 's me ! I was sent to stasis . That 's what " frozen in time " is . He did that to save Frankenstein . Frankenstein was my pet cat ! Look ! Lister , Cloister . Cloister , Lister ! See ? Listen , you stupid monkey , Cloister 's another name for ... for God ! That 's what I 'm saying . I am your God . OK . Turn this into a woman . I 'm serious . So am I ! Look , Frankenstein was my pet cat , right ? And she was pregnant . Now , I got put into suspended animation , I was supposed to be there for 18 months , but I didn 't get out for three million years . You oversleep ? So do I. No ! What I 'm saying is that over those three million years , your entire race of people evolved from my pet cat . Ah , I gotta go now , man , but ... let 's do lunch some time . I 'll put it in my diary . " 12 : 30 , lunch with God . " Formal dress , you know what I 'm saying ? It is true , you know . Yeah ? Then I gotta ask you the ultimate question : If you 're God , why THAT face ? What 's wrong with me face ? What 's wrong with your face ? It 's upside down and inside out , that 's what 's wrong with it . Aow ! Holly ? Yes , Dave ? If I give you my cat dictionary , can you translate this for me ? I 'll give it a go , Dave . Why are you always asking him ? I 'll do it . You 're a toaster . I was thinking of packing it in , it 's turning me into something I don 't like . I 'm not a moaner by nature you know . No , by nature you 're a toaster . It just strikes me there might be something more , something greater , something unimaginably more splendid than heating bread . Lister , it 's arrived ! What has ? The UO ! It 's a pod ! Where ? The observation room . Yes ! No point in running , Lister . It 's mine . I found it . I 've got bagsies . He 's such a child , that boy . Is it safe , Holly ? Yes , Dave . Lister , no point in running . I found it and it 's mine . Calm down . Dead people can have heart attacks , too you know . What is it ? I don 't know . It 's obviously some sort of alien capsule , and clearly they 're intelligent , Lister . The chance to meet an intelligent life form after 18 weeks alone with you . OK , Mr. Intelligence , what are those markings ? Well , I don 't know . I don 't speak alien , you gimboid . What are you doing Lister ? ! ? We don 't know if it 's safe . It 's quarantined ! You might get some squiggly , slimy thing stuck to your face ! Of course it 's safe . Come in . Come on , come in . Ha-ha-ha Tee-hee All right Lister , we 'll play it your way . But don 't think you 're coming out of there . You 're in there for a month . You 're in quarantine . What did you say , Rimmer ? Why did you never do what I tell you ? Don 't you think there 's a shining good reason why I 'm your superior . Yeah . You 've been with the company for 15 years , No , it 's not ! And I 've been with them for eight months . No , it 's not . It 's because I 'm better than you . Better trained , better equipped , better ... Better . Just ... just better . But that must mean the rest of the crew are better than you then . No , it doesn 't . It means ... I 'm not going to let you bait me Lister . This is far too important . Just you wait here , keep that door closed , till I get back with the skutters . Tyke . Oh , Rimmer is such a smeghead , man . Hang on a minute . Give me an R ... Give me an E ... Give me a D ... Give me a Red Dwarf ... garbage pod ? ! ? Holly ? Did Rimmer never work in waste disposal ? No , Dave . It 's one of our Red Dwarf garbage pods with like the writing burnt off in places . Why didn 't you tell him ? Well , it 's a laugh , innit ? After intensive investigation , comma , of the markings on the alien pod , comma , it is become clear , comma , to me , comma , that we are dealing , comma , with a species of awesome intellect , colon . Good . Perhaps they might be able to give you a hand with your punctuation . Shut up . Lights . Lister , are you awake ? Lister ? Lister ? Lister ! Are you awake ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I couldn 't sleep either . It 's the excitement . What excitement ? The alien excitement ! Rimmer , it 's garbage . You can scoff , Lister . That 's nothing new . They laughed at Galileo . They laughed at Edison . They laughed at Columbo . Who 's Columbo ? The man with the dirty mac who discovered America . What makes you think these aliens exist ? They must do , Lister . There are so many things that are strange and odd . So many things we don 't have any explanation for . Like , em ... Why do intelligent people buy cinema hot dogs ? Do you mean that sort of weird and mysterious thing ? No , Lister , I mean like the pyramids . How did they move such massive pieces of stone without the aid of modern technology ? They had massive whips , Rimmer . Massive , massive whips . All right , then , the Bermuda Triangle . Go on , explain that one . You know all the answers . No , I agree there . That is a genuine mystery . How did a song like that ever become a hit ? It defies all reason . I just don 't know why I bother . I get more sense out of a squashed hedgehog . Lister , don 't you ever wonder ? Why are we here ? What 's the grand purpose ? Why does it have to be such a big deal ? Why can 't it be like , human beings are a planetary disease , like Earth 's got German measles or facial herpes , right ? And that 's why all the other planets give us such a wide berth , and say ... " Oh , don 't go near Earth , it 's got human beings on it , they 're contagious ! " So , you 're saying , Lister , you 're an intergalactic , pus-filled cold sore ? At last , Lister , we agree on something . What do you believe in then ? Do you believe in God ? God ? Certainly not ! What a preposterous thought ! I believe in aliens , Lister . Oh , right , fine . Something sensible at last . Aliens Lister , with technology so far in advance of our own we can 't even begin to imagine . But that 's not difficult . Mankind doesn 't even got the technology to create a toupee that doesn 't get big laughs . Aliens Lister , who can give me a real body . Ooh , I can 't wait to see your face in the morning , I really can 't . And nor I yours , Lister . When that pod opens and from it emerges a beautiful alien woman with long green hair and six breasts . Six breasts ? ! Imagine making love to a woman with six breasts ! Imagine making love to a woman . Good morning . How can I help you ? Bonjourno . Um , give me breakfast . What would you like ? Er ... chicken vindaloo and a milkshake . What flavour milkshake ? Um ... beer . Morning , Dave . I 've finished your translation . Who 's Cloister ? Is it me ? Yes Dave . The cats have made you their god . Hey ! Working-class kid makes good ! Your plan to buy a farm on Fiji and open up a hog dog and doughnut diner has become their image of heaven . What ? " And Cloister spake , " ' Lo , I shall lead you to Fuchal , and there we shall open a temple of food , " ' wherein shall be sausages and savory doughnuts and all manner of bountiful things , " ' Yea , even individual sachets of mustard , " ' And those who serve shall wear hats of great majesty , " ' Yea , though they be made of colored cardboard and have humorous arrows through the top , ' " Does it say what happened to the rest of the cats ? Holy wars . There were thousands of years of fighting Dave between the two factions , What two factions ? Well , the ones who believe the hats should be red , and the ones who believe the hats should be blue . You mean , they had a war over whether the doughnut diner hats were red or blue ? Yeah , Most of them were killed fighting about that . It 's daft really , innit ? You 're not kidding . They were supposed to be green . Go on , Hol . Well , finally they called a truce and built two arks and left Red Dwarf in search of Fuchal . But there 's no such place as Fuchal . It 's Fiji . I mean , how are they supposed to find it ? " And Cloister gave to Frankenstein the sacred writing , " saying , ' Those who have wisdom will know its meaning , ' " And it was written thus ; seven socks , one shirt ... " That 's my laundry list ! I lined the cat 's basket with me laundry list ! Well the Blue Hats thought it was a star chart leading to the promised land . Well , it wasn 't . It was my dirty washing . What happened next , Hol ? " And the ark that left first followed the sacred signs , " and lo , they flew straight into an asteroid . " And the righteous in the second ark flew ever onward , knowing they were indeed righteous . " This is terrible . Holy wars . Killing . They 're just using religion as an excuse to be extremely crappy to each other . So , what else is new ? I 'm not interested . And they killed each other over which colored cardboard hat to wear . I 'm not interested . Don 't you think its amazing ? No . You know what happened to people who didn 't eat hot dogs on Fuchal Day ? They were stoned to death by stale doughnuts . Lister , what do you want me to say ? " Congratulations , you 're God " ? I 'm talking about the suffering . People died , I mean ... Cats ... the Cat people died . You 've just come in and rub my nose in it . I could 've been God , you know , given a different start in life . Given the lucky show-biz break you had . I don 't want to be a god . That 's the point . Oh vomitisation ! I don 't believe it ! " I 'm God , but it 's a bit of a drag actually . " Come on ! I 'm not a god ! I 've just been ... misquoted . Lister , for my money , anyone who goes around reading meaning into any old gobbledygook deserves everything they get . I mean , If I 'd had eight socks on my list instead of seven , or if I owned more than one pair of underpants , they might 've have been safe . I just wish I could meet them and explain and apologize . Well , that would look spectacular , wouldn 't it Lister ? God returns in all his splendour and says " Sorry , its all been a total cock-up ! " I didn 't ask for this , I didn 't ask to become their god ! Well I didn 't ask to be killed , Lister . Life 's a bitch . Now smeg off , I 'm busy . They just made stuff up , you know ? I 'm supposed to have given them five sacred laws . Five sacred laws ! I 've broken four of them meself . I 'd have broken the fifth , but there 's no sheep on board . Bye-bye . I mean , what sort of holy writ is this Rimmer ... ? " It is a sin to be cool . " Look , I 'm sick of hearing about these stupid cats ! My concerns are slightly more meaningful than what color stupid smegging cardboard hat I 'm wearing ! I 'm trying to decipher this ! This is science , laddy . You can smirk Lister , but I believe the Quagaars ... Quagars ? Quagaars ! It 's a name I made up . Double A , actually . I believe the Quagaars have the technology to give me a new body ! Never mind this tot , where 's the Cat ? Tot ? ! Tot . Tot ? ! Tot ! Tot ? ! Tot ! Tot ? ! Tot ! We 'll soon see how totty it is laddy , the quarantine period 's nearly up ! Bastard ! Cat ? Cat ? Holly , where 's the Cat ? He 's no longer in my supervision field , Dave . He 's gone down to the cargo decks . I lost him as he entered Supply Pipe 28 . Cat ? Cat ? Cat ! Come on , Cat . Come on , kitty , kitty ! Cat , come on . The crispies have gone warm ! Come on . Cat , come on . Aow ! Yeah ! Yeah-yeah-yeah ! Hey , fellas ! Yes , sir . I 'm back ! Feeling good ! Feed me . You 're always leaving me . Where do you go ? Investigating ! See , I have these feet ... I 'm dying . I 'm telling you about my feet . My investigating feet . Don 't you hear me ? I 'm dying ! Yeah , but I 'm telling you about my feet . Oh why should you listen to me ? A blind old priest that 's lost his faith ? I 'm not listening to you . I 'm trying to tell you about my feet . What do you care ? I don 't care ! You 're the one who 's doing the dying , not me . Why should I let it spoil my evening ? Cat ? Cat ? Cat , when I get you , I 'm going to turn you into a kebab . Holly ? Can you still hear me ? Cat ? Here . Burn the sacred hat . That 's a fearsome hat . Burn it ! Burn it ! It 's a symbol of the lies . It 's burnt . All my life I 've served a lie . Because you 're not there , Cloister , are you ? You 've never been there ! YOU DON 'T EXIST ! Who 's that ? It is I , Cloister ! Who is it , boy ? I told you its me Cloister . I 've returnethed . Is it him ? Is it truly him ? Does he look like a king ? A king ? ! Yeah , yeah ! Is he wearing the doughnut and golden sausage ? Yeah , yeah ! Then it truly is him ! Oh , I 've failed you , Cloister . All these years , I kept my faith . I wore the Holy Custard Stain and the Sacred Gravy Marks . I renounced coolness , and chose the righteous path of slobbiness . But in the end , I failed you . Why didn 't you go on the arks with the rest of the cats ? They left us behind . The sick and the lame . Left us to die . But then ... the boy was born ... to the cripple and the idiot . What idiot ? Your father , boy . My father was a jellybrain ? Yes , That 's why he ate his own feet . I did wonder . But as one by one we died , my faith died also . You tested me , Cloister , and ... I failed you . Oh , no , you didn 't fail , old man . You passed . I 'm giving you ... I 'm giving you an A + distinction . You mean , there 's a place for me on Fuchal ? A place ? Got your own bathroom , en suite , cork floors , your own barbecue on the patio , double glaise , a phone , everything ! Ah my hat ! I 've burned my sacred hat ! No , you haven 't ! A miracle ! This is the ... the happiest day of my ... Did I ever tell you about my feet ? My investigating feet ? Once upon a time , there was an old man ... Well , are you ready , Rimmer ? Open it ! Open it ! Well ? What 's there ? Are you sure you 're ready for this Rimmer ? Yes ! Come on , you gimboid ! Incredible ! A stupendous moment in my own personal history ! The perfectly preserved remains of a Quagaar warrior ! Yeah , right , Rimmer . Absolutely . They must have looked something like ... a roast chicken . # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere ... # It 's a garbage pod ! # I 'm all alone , more or less ... # It 's a smegging garbage pod ! # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

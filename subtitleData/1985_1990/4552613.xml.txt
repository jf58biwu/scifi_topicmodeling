 Shooting stars ? Dr. Hirose called me out here . I wonder if this is related to that ... Justs as I thought , GT medicine . Its color is affected by shooting stars . You , you want me to give you this ? The GT medicine is still incomplete . I just can 't hand it over . BIOTHERAPY Dr. Hirose is running late huh ? - He was at his vacation house last night . - Ah , his pattern of studying till late at night . If you wake him up he 's going to be grumpy . Yeah , you 're right . REPORT ON GT MEDICINE This data ... When was this put here ? Look . Data on the GT medicine ? I want to see this . - Yeah . - Who are you ? Who used the GT medicine without permission ? You ? - No , not me . - Did you Miada ? No . I didn 't either . I 'm the one who did it . It was you Date ? Why did you use the GT medicine without permission ? You should set an example since you 're in charge . Doing that is going to cause problems . Doctor . We have a misunderstanding here . Misunderstanding ? GT medicine is ... my development or have or have you forgotten that ? My research has companies that want to finance it . Those companies wanted to see the affect of this so I wanted to show them . The GT medicine ... can have big side effects ... Unless those problems are solved ... it can 't be shown to the public . This research ... we have to continue it with great care . I have one question for you . you made me stop the research but ... you 're going to continue to research GT medicine on your own , right ? You took my research from me . That 's absurd . I look down on you with disgust . We are not teacher and student anymore . Get out of here . Those companies want my research badly . There are a lot of companies that give me unlimited funds . Excuse me . Maida ... What are you going to do ? Are you going to come with me ? I 'm not forcing you . If you want to come with me you can . Cheif , wait please . In GT medicine liquid , animals grow ten time faster then normal Doctor . I wonder why he is so negative towards this amazing research ? Seems like the powr went out . Ms. Tachibana ! Mayumi ... That 's a serious prank to pull . Mayumi ! Wait up ! Hey wait ! Come back ! Don 't get so upset . I 'm sorry OK , please ? Please don 't be so upset . No . I can 't forgive you . We had a date yesterday and you ditched me so I couldn 't sleep . Because of that I had to skip school today . It 's all your fault . You 're blaming me for to many things . It 's fine to blame you for all that . I can say that today . I want to be selfish . OK I understand . See I 'm apologizing . Forgive me . No . Hello , Dr. Hirose 's research office . Ah , Mr. Maeda . Where are you right now ? Yes . What ! Dr. Hirose has been murdered ? Hello ? Hello are you there ? Ms. Shiozawa ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Ms. Shiozawa ? Where is the GT medicine ? WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE ? ! WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE ? ! WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE ? ! I don 't know . The GT medicine is something we need by any means ! Give it to me ! There is no substance on our planet that would create GT medicine . So I want the actual GT medicine ! I don 't know . I don 't know where it is . Well , I 'll make you remember ... So you still can 't remember ? ! That 's the lab ! Thank you for your help . You can go . Mr. Kanabara I still have some questions I want to ask . I 'll head home as soon as we are done . So wait at the apartment . OK . Hurry home please . Now Mr. Kanabara . - Yes . - Be quiet and relax . You 're Ms. Tachibana right ? I 'm Mr. Maeda . We meet several times at Dr. Hirose 's lab . Did you know Ms. Shiozawa was killd ? Ms. Shiozawa too ? What do you mean Ms. Shiozawa too ? Dr. Hirose was killed . Last night , Dr. Date was called and when he went to his house ... he said Dr. Hirose was killed . Actually I need a favor . According to Dr. Date Dr. Hirose must have ... tired to tell him about his new discovery of GT medicine . The doctor is very methodical . He must have left his research there . Today I 'm going to meet up with Dr. Date . My favor is this , until then ... Look for the last research Dr. Hirose left . I don`t think I ... Because we left the research group ... we are unable to come and go freely . There is no other way except to ask you . Please ! Please help . Please ! What are you doing ? It`s the detective ! Stop now ! - I 'm begging you ! - Stop ! I said stop ! It`s terrible ! Mayumi ! - When is this going to stop ! - Please calm down . you have to calm down . Be strong . This is pretty scary ... Then wait here . I 'll go look myself . Are you really going ? If we don 't go Dr. Hirose would have died for nothing . We need to get the research he left . As a scientist and all ... OK , I 'll go too . We have to hurry up and search . Not this one . Not this one either . Not this one . This isn 't it either . As I thought it 's not here . Must be at Dr. Hirose 's vacation house . The GT medicine ... Give me the GT medicine . It 's you the killer from earlier . Mayumi ! Run ! Mayumi ! Stop right there ! Put your hands down or we 'll shot ! Stop moving ! Take that ! Monster ! Mayumi ! Hurry and get in ! I was supposed to meet Maeda , but he didn 't show . I was wondering why so I went to the lab . Mr. Maeda He was killed . What ? I think it was that monster that did it . That monster ... wants the GT medicine . GT medicine ? You sure ? Dr. Hirose and Ms. Shiozawa have been killed . For what reason ? Why is that monster after the GT medicine ? I don 't know . I truly have no idea . - Please tell us . - Why was it that Dr. Hirose ... removed you as cheif of research ? Because of the GT medicine 's side effects . If GT medicine enters water in large amounts ... it 's predicted that 99 % of the plankton ... will become completly extinct . That means if plankton becomes extinct ... the oceans components will change , and if they change what do you think will happen to the animals ... that are the planet now ? It 's been said that the ocean is the orgin of life ... If those componets change ... then all life will die . No ... not just the ocean 's ... If you try to make the plant 's grow faster with it ... what do you think will happen if it is spread on the ground ? The world ... The world will change . If the components change ... A new world will begin with new componets . That 's the devil 's research ! The development of GT medicine is an awful thing ! Say whatever you want ... Whether it 's good or bad the results will decide . Even if the process is bad if the results are good , then it 's good . It 's almost finished ... The research is steadily progressing ... I want ... I want the research documents that Dr. Hirose left behind . His tone over the phone last night ... Dr. Hirose ... he most have found something important . This must be it . I found it . Mr. Kanabara Who or what the hell are you ? Why do you want the GT medicine ? I 've come from the far future ... a future unimaginable by humans . I 've come here by light . By light ! ? That light was a time machine ? That 's right . My people are the second race of earthlings . The inferior humans ... were unable to clean the pollution caused by their development . Unable to recover from their destroyed environment . In 500 years ... they all died off along with everything . After that began our new Genesis . The alien bacteria brought by shooting stars were our ancestors . So like the creatures on earth began from plankton the second generation ... evolved from bacteria from space ? From a time capsule buried deep underground ... we discovered GT medicine . What was written in the time capsule ? Was GT medicine completed ? One month from now it will be complete . As GT medicine " Two " . The creators Hirose Osamu and Date Keisuke It was written that it was god 's creation that saved them from famine many times . Give me the GT medicine . I will change the ocean 's wit the GT medicine and make all creatures extinct . So we can start our generation even earlier . Where do you store the GT medicine ? The place we store our GT medicine ? Is that how it is ? If I know where it is I will nothing to do with you fools . I 'm going to tell you why I chose now to show up . To get my hands on GT medicine ... at the same time kill the creators of it and ... to stop them from making GT " Two " . Now was the perfect time . You 're to late . I 'm saying you 're to late you fool . DIE ! STOP IT ! STOP IT ! Mr ... Mr. Kanabara ... Mr. Date ! Mr. Date ! Did you see ? The moment of GT " Two " ... that it destroyed that person ... from the future 's cells ... Mr. Date ! Did you say GT medicine " Two " ? GT medicine is underneath my study ... Destroy it ... The GT medicne " Two " research ... is on the floppy disk in my study ... GT medicine " Two " was ... completed ... Mr. Date ! Mr. Date ! Stay awake ! Mr. Date ! It 's a dream ... Everyting is a dream . Such terrible things only come from dreams . It 's not a dream . It 's reality . Dr. Hirose , Mr. Date ... Mr. Maeda , Ms. Shiozawa ... They 're all dead . And now ... And now ? Only GT medicine is left ... Mayumi ... I 'm gonna do it ! Based on Dr. Date 's research ... I 'll finish GT " Two " . And annouce it in their names ! The GT medicine ... we will use it for a world of peace . Translated by : SARUofAKITA and unknown friend . Timings : meatisgood

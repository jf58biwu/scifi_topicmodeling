Designer colors to suit your demanding taste . ... the Ministry of Information , Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann . Good evening , David . What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings ? Bad sportsmanship . A ruthless minority seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues . They can 't stand seeing the other fellow win . If they played the game , they 'd enjoy life more . There are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large . In a free society , information 's the name of the game . But the cost , Deputy Minister . 7 % of the G.N.P. I understand the taxpayers ' concern . People want value for money . That 's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges . It 's absolutely fair that those found guilty pay for their detention and the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation . Is the government winning the battle against terrorists ? Ah , yes . We 're fielding all their strokes , running all of them out . We 're consistently knocking them for six . I 'd say they 're nearly out of the game . The bombing campaign is in its 13th year . Beginner 's luck . Thank you , Deputy Minister . Thank you , David . Thank you , David . And a very merry Christmas to you all . " Scrooge was better than his word . He did it all , and more . And to Tiny Tim , who did not die , he became a second father . He became as good a friend in the good old world . And so , as Tiny Tim observed , God bless us , everyone . " You 're giving me the runaround . Ha ha ha ! Hey , don 't throw that . That 's only for long distance . Sorry , boys . We haven 't got bacon . Got no bacon . Ha ha ha ! Who 's there ? Who is that ? Father Christmas can 't come if we haven 't got a chimney . You 'll see . No ! Under powers entrusted to me under section 47 , paragraph 7 of Council Order 438476 , Mr. Buttle , Archibald , of Shangri-la Towers , has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with enquiries , and that he 's liable to certain financial obligations as specified by Council . Sign here , please . Mmm ! Mmm ! Let go of him ! Where are you taking him ? There . Thank you . Same again , please . There . Press harder this time . Good . What is this all about ? That 's your receipt for your husband . Here 's my receipt for your receipt . Are you OK ? We 're Department of Works . Department of Works up here . Careful with those bloody things . Get the hell out of here ! Don 't you worry , love . There 's nothing to worry about . It 's Tuttle downstairs who can worry . His name 's Buttle . There must be some mistake . Mistake ? We don 't make mistakes . They 've gone back to metric without telling us . Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? " Buttle . " " Buttle , Archibald . " Damn ! Oh , shit ! Mister - Mr. Lowry , would you step in here , please ? Uh ... I say ... has anybody seen Lowry ? Has anybody seen Sam Lowry ? Sam . Sam . Hello . What ? Mr. Kurtzmann . God ... you 're up late . Is it ? The electrics here are up the spout . Oh , yours , too ? Well , I 'll be there as soon as I can . What 's this gun for ? This one , sister , is a 9 millimeter submachine gun used for close-quarter combat fighting . Sam ! Jack . Long time no see . Hey ! What are you doing here ? What 's the problem ? Problem ? No problem . Everything 's fine . Wonderful . Marvelous . Allison 's in great shape . I 'm on security level five now . It 's a great year . You sound worried . Worried , me ? It 's you I 'm worried about . Whatever happened to you ? Records ? Sam ? It 's great to see you . I 'm going to be late . Sam , your life is going wrong . Records is a dead-end department . It 's impossible to get noticed . I know . Wonderful . See you , Jack . Give my regards to Allison and the twins . Triplets . Triplets ? God ... how time flies . Very clear delineation of picture . Highly mobile . Next . I want to report a wrongful arrest . You want the Information Adjustment Department . I 've been there . You have a form I need to fill out . Got an arrest receipt ? Yeah . Is it stamped ? Stamped ? There 's no stamp here . You can 't have the form until this is stamped . Where is that ? Information Adjustments . Ahem ... It 's nothing . It keeps picking up old films . Perhaps the machine 's on the blink . There 's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers . Tuttle should 've had Â£ 31 debited , not Buttle ! A mistake ! At least it 's not ours . Isn 't it ? Whose then ? Information Retrieval . Expediting is put in for electrical procedures for Buttle , Archibald , shoe repair operative . Security has invoiced for Tuttle , Archibald , heating engineer . What a relief ! Well , finish your tea , son . What ? Oh , thanks . I don 't know what I 'd do if you ever got promoted . No worry there . But if they did promote you ? I 'd turn it down . Would you , really ? Really . You 've been promoted . It 's your mother , isn 't it ? Pulling strings again . It 's time for you to accept responsibility . Your father would be appalled at your lack of promotion . I wish you 'd stop interfering . I don 't want promotion . I 'm happy where I am . No , you 're not . Jack Lint 's a lesson to you . He doesn 't have your brains , but he 's got the ambition . You 've got me and the deputy minister . Now please , Mrs. Lowry , don 't get upset . Please wait in reception . You 're giving her wrinkles . Just try and relax . I 'll make you 20 years younger . Dr. Jaffe , you 're a genius . Would you like to be surgeon general ? I know simply everybody . They won 't know you when I 've finished . Mmm . First , we remove the excess derma ... so ... now the flaccid tissues under the eyes and forehead . Zip . Now ... I lift ... the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wig , into the hairline . Now the template . Easy . A bit of sticky . And already she 's twice as beautiful as she was before . Voila ! Mr. Helpmann was close to your father . He was close to me . Still is . He 'll take you under his wing when you get to Information Retrieval . - Thank you , sir . - You 'll like it there . You 're not listening to me , Mother . What the hell is this , lady ? It 's a present for my son . Really ! I hope you like it . It 's very exclusive . What is it ? Something for an executive . - Ahem . - Ah , Madame Lowry . You look exquisite today . Merry Christmas . Hello , Spiro . Merry Christmas . You remember my son Samuel . Of course . We 're joining Mrs. Terrain . Yes . She 's waiting . I thought we 'd talk . We will . Oh , God ! She 's with what 's-her-name . Alma , how are you ? You look wonderful ! Hello , Shirley . Thank you , Spiro . Salt ? Not yet . Sam ... happy Christmas . So sorry we 're late . Thanks . What are you going to have ? I can 't decide between number one or number two . What do you recommend ? Between you and me , number two . Thank you , Spiro . Shirley , what will you have ? Between you and me , number one . Madame Lowry ? Oh , to hell with the diet . I 'll have a number eight . A most perceptive choice , madame . Monsieur ? Steak , please . Rare . Monsieur , quel numero ? I don 't know which number . That one there . That 's fine . Mother - Alma , you wicked girl . You started your treatment . Number ? You noticed . Say the number ! I 'll tell you about it . Number three . Mother , listen ! Numero ... huit ! Braised veal in wine sauce . Mmm ! Mmm ! It 's too exciting . I 've left Dr. Jaffe for Dr. Chapman . Numero deux ... duck a l 'orange . Chapman ? Excusez-moi . The acid man ? Really , Ida ! Just because his techniques are revolutionary . I don 't call Dr. Jaffe " the knife man . " Numero un ... crevettes a la mayonnaise . I 'm sorry , Alma . It 's all right . Steak ... numero trois ! Mesdames ... monsieur ... bon ... appetit ! - Merci . - Merci . Acid , on the other hand , can be used for such wonderful , subtle shading , such delicate nuances , like an etching . And it is quicker . If it wasn 't for this complication - it could have happened to anybody - I 'd have had this dressing off yesterday . - Mm-hmm . - Shirley . Salt . What were we saying ? This isn 't rare . I saw the most wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemist 's - gift tokens , medical gift tokens . That sounds marvelous ! It 's good at any doctor 's and most major hospitals . It 's also accepted for gynecological examinations , including caesarean sections . I don 't know what to say . It never happens here . I 'll do something about it . Really , Sam ! Can 't you do something about these terrorists ? It 's my lunch hour . Besides , it 's not my department . That was one of the little things I 've been dying to tell you . Look . Sam 's been promoted to Information Retrieval . That 's wonderful ! Congratulations , Sam . Stop it ! I 'm not going to Information Retrieval ! Don 't stick your oar in , Mother . Pepper ? I 've got to go . You haven 't had dessert . I don 't want dessert , a promotion , or anything ! Of course you do . You must have hopes , wishes , dreams ! No , nothing . Not even dreams . Sam ! Sam ! Ah , ah ! Oh , my God ! Hello ? Central Services ? I 'm at 579-B , block 19 , northwestern section D. That 's exit one on Green Pastures Highway . I 've got trouble with my air-conditioning . Central Services cannot take service calls between 2300 and 0900 hours . This has not been a recording . It 's an emergency ! I 've got to have a heating engineer . Thank you for calling Central Services ... Aw , shit ! Hello . Hello . Hello . Hello . Hello . Hello . Hello , Mr. Lowry ? Yes , who is this ? Put the phone down , and raise your hands . What ? Who is this ? Nice and easy , now . Nice and easy ... Keep your hands where I can see them . What are you doing ? Harry Tuttle , heating engineer , at your service . Tuttle ? Are you from Central Services ? I called Central Services . They 're a little overworked these days . I intercepted your call . You did what ? Just a minute ... What was that business with the gun ? Just a precaution , sir . Just a precaution . I 've had traps set for me before now . Central Services would love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle . Are you telling me this is illegal ? Officially , only Central Services can touch this stuff . Hold this , please . But nowadays they can 't get decent staff . So they turn a blind eye , as long as I 'm careful . If they could prove I worked on their equipment , that would be different . Wouldn 't it be simpler - Hold this , please . Wouldn 't it be simpler to work with Central Services ? Couldn 't stand the paperwork . It 's getting warm . Couldn 't stand what ? The paperwork . Your whole system could be burning , and I couldn 't do anything without filling out a 27B-6 . Bloody paperwork . One has to expect a certain amount . Why ? I came into this game for the action . Travel light , get in , get out , a man alone ... Now you can 't move without a form . Found it . There 's your problem . Can you fix it ? No , but I can bypass it with one of these . That 's fine by me . Are you expecting anyone ? No . No ! Wait , wait ! Shh ! The flashlight ! Central Services . Central Services . You rang , sir ? Trouble with your air-conditioning ? Air-conditioning , sir ? No , it 's all right . It 's ... It 's fixed . Fixed ? Fixed ? Yes , I mean ... It fixed itself . Fixed itself ? Ha ha ha ! Yes . Ha ha ha ! Machines don 't fix themselves . He 's tampered with it . He 's tampered with it . Sorry you 've had a wasted journey . Oh , that 's all right . I think we ought to have a little look . Have you got a 27B-6 ? A 27B-6 ? 27B-6 ... - 6 ... Now look what you 've done ! Well ... Have you got a 27B-6 ? Not ... as such ! But we 'll get one . It 's all right , it 's all right . Sorry , I 'm a stickler for paperwork . Where would we be if we didn 't follow procedures ? We 'll be back . We 'll be back ! Thanks for coming . We 'll be back , you bastard ! Righty-o ! Thanks , Lowry . You 're a good man in a tight corner . Listen , Tuttle ... I , uh ... I just happen to work at the Ministry of Information . What ? Well , I just happen to know that Information Retrieval are looking for an Archibald Tuttle , heating engineer . You , uh ... you wouldn 't by any chance ... Would you ? My good friends call me Harry . Information Retrieval , huh ? The big boys . Ha ha ha ! What do they want you for ? Time to go . Sorry . You must let me give you something . How much will it be for the work ? Oh , come on . You did me a favor . Just check the corridor . Well , thanks . Listen , kid , we 're all in it together . Go on . Right . OK . All clear . I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious . What 's playing today ? Casablanca . Mr. Lowry , step in here , please . Lowry ! Damn it , Lowry ! Psst ! We 're in terrible trouble ! Shh ! Look at this . It 's a check . It 's the refund for Tuttle . Tuttle ! I mean Buttle . It 's been confusion from the start . He 's been overcharged for Information Retrieval procedures , and someone 's trying to blame us . Can I see ? I 've never seen a refund . I 'll bet it 's Jeffries . Yes , he believes people should pay more for their interrogation . We must get rid of it . Send it to somebody else . Send it to Buttle . It 's his check . I 've tried that . Look at this . The census has him down as dormanted . The computer 's got him down as deleted . Hang on . Information Retrieval has him inoperative . Security has him as excised . Administration says he 's completed . He 's dead . Dead ? Well , that 's ... awful . We 'll never get rid of the thing now . What will we do , Sam ? Could try next of kin . Next of kin ... There we go . Buttle , Veronica , Mrs. Veronica ? What 's the check number ? 271 ... 56789 ... - O74328K . Write into memory . Central Banking . Veronica Buttle ... Mrs ... . Deposit . Thank God for that . Would you like some tea ? There 's a problem . She doesn 't have a bank account . That 's it , then . I might as well hang myself now . This couldn 't have happened before this seventh tier reorganization . That 's Simmons 's doing . He and Jeffries sit together at lunch . Bastards ! We could lose it behind a filing cabinet . Look , there is one solution . Drive out to Mrs. Buttle , let her endorse the check , and let her cash it . That 's brilliant , Sam . I 'll do it for you . Authorize the check . What 's the address ? Everything 's in here . What shall I do next ? Pink and blue receipts . Sign there , there , and there . I think I 've broken a bone . My wrist is all limp . What a pathetic creature I am . I 'll do it for you . Right . I 'll be on my way . Sam ? Hmm ? You are good to me . Here 's looking at you , kid . Here 's looking at you . Brazil Where hearts were entertained in June We stood beneath that amber moon We interrupt with news of a terrorist bombing - Brazil And clung together Then Tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say And now When twilight beams the sky above Recalling - Hello , could you tell me where - Piss off ! Hello . I 'll never confess ! Mrs. Buttle ? Uh ... Mrs. Buttle ? Uh ... are you Mrs. Buttle ? Uh ... My name 's Lowry . Uh , Sam Lowry . Um ... I 'm from the Ministry of Information . I 've come to give you a check . It 's a refund , actually . There was a mistake . Mistake ? Yes . Not in my department . I 'm only Records . No , it , uh - I 'll tell you what it is . It seems that Mr. Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval . Yes . They don 't usually make mistakes , but I suppose we 're all human . Oh ! What happened to the , um ... Actually , my coming here is rather unorthodox , as payments are normally made through central computer , but as there were certain difficulties , we thought that rather than cause delay , we 'd let you have it now , it being Christmas and all . My husband 's dead , isn 't he ? I assure you , Mrs. Buttle , the ministry is very scrupulous about eradicating any error , but if you have any complaints , I 'd be happy to send you the appropriate forms . What have you done with his body ? Oh ! Gosh . Uh ... I don 't know anything about that . I 'm just delivering the check . So if you wouldn 't mind signing these two receipts , I 'd be only too happy to leave you in peace . He hadn 't done anything . He was good ! What have you done with his body ? This isn 't being very helpful . I didn 't have to come here . Aah ! Are you all right ? Are you all right ? Mrs. Buttle , are you all right ? It 's you . Wait ! Stop ! Don 't go ! Stop ! Stop ! I had nothing to do with it ! Stop ! He 's coming back . Jesus Christ ! Go away . Her name 's Jill . What ? Jill ? Jill who ? Jill who ? Layton . Jill Layton . You 're a good girl . What are you doing here ? Waiting for my daddy . He 'll be pleased when he gets home . I had the transport pool onto me . Do you know about a missing personnel transporter ? Personnel transporter ? What ? Oh , the pranets . I had a personal transporter . I 'll do the paperwork tomorrow . Um ... Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle ... Buttle 's check ? Can I forget it ? Yeah . What a relief . I 'm going to have nightmares . Damn ! Blast ! What 's the matter ? Do you know how to get round an IRQ-3 ? Information on third-level suspects is classified . Inquiries through Information Retrieval . They never tell you anything . Come the time they want something from us , oh , yes . There 's one way round it . I could accept my mother 's promotion . Yes . No ! You can 't . You just turned it down . I didn 't sign the form . I did it for you . You didn 't . I did . You didn 't ! I did . What 'd you do that for ? That 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? Oh , I don 't know . I don 't know what I want . Come on . Before they turn the lights out . There 's one way round it . I could always accept promotion to Information Retrieval . Sam ! What are you doing ? My God ! What 's going on ? Emergency procedures . I haven 't got an emergency . This is an emergency . Have a nice day . Here . Sign that . What is it ? A 27B-6 . What do you think ? Spoor , come here . I found it . Spoor ! Spoor , come here . A bypass on the transformer . You 've had that scab Tuttle here , ain 't you ? What are you talking about ? Who fixed your ducts ? They fixed themselves . Oh , yeah ? Then where did this come from ? Out of your nostril , eh ? Central Services . They don 't take kindly to sabotage . Sabotage , sir . This place is in a terrible state . You 're not leaving it like this , are you ? Why not ? Just blow your nose , and it 's fixed , isn 't it ? Well ... Oh , my ... My Jesus ! What have you done with his body ? Yah ! Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure of your company At her apartment tonight From 8 : 30 To midnight To celebrate the completion Of her recent cosmetic surgery Uh ... Thanks . It 's reply paid .

Why don 't we go back to my flat ? - Forget it . you don 't trust me ? - Trust you ? you hijack my truck , loses me my job , have security men looking for me . I was only trying to help . - yeah . 0.K. you don 't trust me , I don 't trust you . What 's in that parcel ? you saved it from the lorry . It must be something very special . I saved you from the lorry . you 're not something very special . I 'm opening it . - Don 't touch that . Sam ! It 's me and Shirley . Mrs. Terrain ! That should hold it . What happened to you now ? My complication had a little complication . But Dr. Chapman says I 'll soon be up and bounding about like a young gazelle . you buying a Christmas present for your mother ? yes , a little something . Shirley and I come here regular-larly . We love romantic lingerie . Picture me in these . Are you all right ? you don 't deserve to be ! What a stupid thing ! How could you ? Look at these people ! It was a bomb ! I should 've opened it . I sat there with it next ... There 's your bomb , asshole ! Bribes , for official monkeys like you . Make yourself useful . Don 't touch her ! She 's hurt . Don 't touch her ! Stop ! Sam , no ! These helmets make your scalp itch . Don 't mention it . And they make you sweat . Half the time I can never see where I 'm going . It 's a great niagara of perspiration coming down . I 'm lucky . I got these thick eyebrows . That keeps it up and channels it out to the ears . He 's somebody from Information Retrieval . They hang around in lingerie . Where is she ? Jill , is that you ? Excuse me , sir . That is government property . Jill ! Answer me ! I 'm looking for a girl with blonde hair . Medium height , green eyes . I don 't know . They check all that at the depot . We can 't allow that . It 's more than our job 's worth . Jill , you must be here . you can fill in an application form if you 're a relative . Now do stop , sir , please . Sorry about that , sir . Regulations . This is a black eye for the department . I don 't care how you behaved when you were at Records . We are an executive branch . We 're proud of our reputation and we protect it . That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for ! I thought I told you to deal with it ! And what the hell is this mess ? An empty desk is an efficient desk ! Good God ! Queries from Security . Searches from Central Banking about a check . Notices from Accounting about unreturned receipts ! I have to find ... - Shut up ! I don 't know what 's going on here , Lowry . But you can 't intimidate us , with your friends and relatives in high places ! Now shape up ! Lime , I have to use your computer . Sorry , I 'm a bit busy . you seem to have a lot to do yourself . Shit ! Come off it , Jack . you can see if she 's been arrested . This case has become much more complicated since last we talked . But she 's innocent . She 's done nothing wrong . Tell that to the wives of the men she blew up today . She 's not alone in this . We just got a report that Tuttle wrecked an entire flat . It looks like in your block . I 'd keep my eyes open if I were you . Bye . you don 't think Tuttle the girl are in league ? I do . Everything 's connected . Cause and effect , that 's the beauty of it . 0ur job is to trace the connections and reveal them . This Buttle-Tuttle confusion was planned from the inside . She 's innocent , Jack . We 've always been close . - yes , Jack . Until this all blows over , just stay away from me . 0h , my God ! It 's you ! It 's you ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? your thermostat 's gone , and then some . What happened to my flat ? Hello . What ? It 's for you . But you don 't live here anymore . - What ? Do you know what this is ? It 's an H2206 authorizing the compulsory temporary requisitioning of this flat , for repairs . Don 't forget your receipt ! Sorry , but I 'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork . Tuttle . What are you doing ? It 's getting cold in here . It smells badly . It 's shit ! We 're filling up with shit ! Shit ! We 're all in it together , kid . Jill ! Jill ! 0h , God . Are you all right ? What happened to you after ... - your face . Are you hurt ? No , I 'm fine . I was worried sick about you . Who was that ? - That 's a friend of mine . 0h , God . Shit . We 'd better get out of here . Quick , quick . Are you sure this is all right ? - yes , yes , certain . My mother 's away for Christmas . She 's spending it at the plastic surgeon 's . The wraps come off tomorrow . Lock the door after me . And don 't answer the phone . Where are you going ? - I know a way to save you . Trust me . I can do it . - you can 't go without me ! Dawson , could you put me through to Mr. Helpmann 's office ? I can 't , sir. you have to go through the proper channels . And the proper channels are classified information . I see the Ministry 's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest . Thank you , Dawson . Goodbye , Mr. Lime . - Goodbye , Dawson . No , no , Arthur. you 're flat on the G ! It 's your breathing . Take a deep breath after " Noel " . Ready ? 1 , 2 , 3 . Ere I am , J.H. The ghost in the machine . Mr. Helpmann ? Jill ! Who 's there ? What do you think ? Is it me ? you don 't exist anymore . I 've killed you . Jill Layton is dead . Care for a little necrophilia ? Merry Christmas . Something for an executive ? She 's dead . This is a friend of mine .

I assure you , I 'm doing everything within my power . But the rules of the game are laid down . We all have to play by them . Even me . It 's all a mistake . you 've got to understand that . From the Department 's point of view , there is an own goal . I 'm not a terrorist. you know that . Please get me out of here ! Information Retrieval is expensive . you 're running up an enormous bill by not cooperating . Please , Mr. Helpmann . Help me find Jill . Jill. yes . Sam , I think I ought to tell you . I 'm afraid she 's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion . Thrown in the towel . Dead ? yes . It 's a bit confusing but it seems she was killed resisting arrest . No , it 's all right . I did that . The odd thing is it happened twice . A bit of a disputed call , I 'm afraid . All I can say is don 't fall at the last fence . The finish is in sight . See you in the paddock . Do cooperate . Think of your mother . Good luck , Keep your eye on the ball . Got to go . Can 't keep the orphans waiting . Don 't fight it , son . Confess . Quickly !

No , Jack , please , no . No ! you okay ? - Tuttle ! Call me Harry . Ah , Mr. Lowry . So pleased you could make it . Right this way . It 's a sad loss . your mother was with her at the end . Mrs. Terrain has just received that most wonderful of gifts . She came to us physically new . She goes hence from us not so physically new . But the spirit never grows old . Madame Lowry . Mother ! Mother , mother ! Stop calling me that . Mother ! Mother , please ! Is this guy bothering you ? Mother ! Go away . This is very sacred moment . He 's got away from us , Jack . I 'm afraid you 're right , Mr. Helpmann . He 's gone . Tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say Now , as twilight beams the sky above Recalling thrills of our love There 's one thing I 'm certain of Return I will To old Brazil

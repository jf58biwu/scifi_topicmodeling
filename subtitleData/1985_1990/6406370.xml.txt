 * [ Dramatic instrumental music ] * [ Iguana hissing ] [ Rattling ] [ Rattling and hissing ] Exploration party calling mojave lab . [ Radio crackles ] Exploration party calling mojave lab . Sue , are you there ? Sue ? [ Radio crackles ] Sue , we 're at three sisters . Sue , you there ? Michael , they 're not answering . Let me check it out . [ Radio crackles ] Mojave lab , come in . Sue , come in , please . Mojave lab , this is exploration party calling . [ Radio crackles ] Sue , are you there ? Sue , come in , please . [ Snores ] Sue , come in . [ Grunts ] Yes , Michael ? What 's happening ? Taking a little nap ? Everything 's all right . Status report , please . Well , we bagged a rattlesnake . Great , get another one , and we can have a barbecue . Remember it ... Both : Tastes like chicken . That 's ' cause you forgot what real chicken tastes like . Michael , check this out . We have birds over there . Hey , we got buzzards circling about a quarter mile away . Whatever it is still might be edible . We 'll check it out and let you know . Okay , just be careful . Over and out . Want some ? With as much cover-up as you can put in there . Mm , thanks . Ugh . What 's Andre using for coffee these days ? I 'm not sure you want to know . Cleaning compound ? It 's about the right color . And the right taste . [ Doors rattles open and shut ] Have you and sue finished the supply inventory ? Yes , we have . I figured if we cut calories to 900 a day , Bake some game every once and a while , We can stay here for about another two months . Hal , we got to start thinking seriously About getting out of here . The rocky Mountain lab 's ... Is 1,800 Miles away . We haven 't had a clear message from them in ten days . Our job is to stay here . Our job is to survive . Sue , you 're not gonna believe this . What is it ? Jesus , gargoyles ! John ! John ! [ Screaming ] Michael ? John ? [ Growling ] [ Gun shots , screaming ] Michael , John , David here . What 's going on ? John , Michael , this is David . What the hell is going on ? You two better get out there on the double . Right . I 'll get butch . Don 't waste your time . He 's the best tracker we got . He knows the outside better than anyone . All right , keep him under control . [ Dog whimpers ] Just go out there and bring them back . Don 't go looking for any more trouble . Is that understood ? Sir , yes , sir . [ Ominous music ] * [ Hatch creaks open , clunks ] [ Ominous music ] * [ Quiet buzzing ] Ugh ! This government issue shit is for the birds . Thanks for your opinion . Now fix it . David here . Nothing outside . Anything on the motion detectors ? No activity . We 're out of here . I sure don 't like sending sue out there . Don 't worry . She 's in good hands . Yeah , but I wish he 'd learn to follow procedures . You love it up here , don 't you ? Man , I don 't know how you do it . This place gives me the creeps . I just wish we were on our way out of here , Headed to the rocky Mountain lab . Thanks . That 's easy for you to say . You were trained for that kind of stuff . I just wish John and Michael would 've listened to me . I told them to take butch along . If they had , we wouldn 't be doing this . How could it be gargoyles ? They 've never come out this far before . Survivors . Maybe it was survivors . Survivors would see any one of us as just somebody to rob . Wouldn 't they ? I mean , I think ... I think it 's your turn to get the shine , Neil . Good plan . Here 's looking at you , kid . Whoo . When there ain 't no food , It sure does help to have good shine . [ Chuckles ] You think they 're gonna find anything out there ? Yeah , they 're gonna discover they don 't have to cut rations , Not with two less mouths to feed . Well , maybe it wasn 't survivors . I mean , John 's last words were " Jesus , gargoyles . " Gargoyles , shmargoyles . Just thank your lucky stars you 're the most essential person Old hal 's got here . I wouldn 't go out there to find them if they tripled my pay , Assuming there 's anybody left to sign paychecks . That sucks . It sure is quiet out here . Yeah , it 's always been like this , Even before the accident . The accident . You know , I used to think we 'd go out in a ball of fire , Not because some leaky test tube in a lab somewhere . I still don 't think it was one of ours . [ Sighs ] Come on . Ours , theirs , who cares ? With 99 % of the population gone , It doesn 't make much difference , does it ? And now we have the vaccine , And we only have ourselves to give it to . If anyone survived out there without mutating ... [ Breathing heavily ] They must be living like savages or something . If anyone survived with those things out there . [ Birds squawking ] [ Whirring ] Mojave lab , David here . Yeah , David , what is it ? About quarter of a mile from three sisters rocks . I think we spotted what John and Michael found . [ Radio crackles ] Ask him what it is . What have you got , David ? Buzzards . I 'll let you know as soon as we know . [ Radio crackles ] [ Suspenseful music ] * [ Dog barking ] Didn 't help them that much , did it ? [ Flies buzzing ] [ Whispers ] Oh , God . [ Quietly ] Holy shit . [ Wind blowing ] [ Flies buzzing ] [ Baby crying ] [ Foreboding music ] * [ Baby crying ] [ Sound of baby crying continues ] [ Doll clicks , crying stops ] [ Twinkling music ] * David , look . They have a diary too . Let 's get the hell out of here . [ Heart beating , low growl ] [ Radio crackles ] Mojave lab , David here . I think we found what John and Michael saw . It 's a human camp site . Ten males , ages 40 maybe down to 10 or 11 . [ Sighs ] No survivors . They 've been ripped to pieces . Looks like maybe two family groups . No females ? Affirmative . Males only . [ Rocks rumble , dog barks ] Hal , this could be the breakthrough We 've been waiting for . If they 've survived outside this long , They must have some kind of natural immunity . We 've got to examine them . I don 't even have a way of bringing in John and Michael . It 's a long way to cart bodies , Especially if those gargoyle things are around . Then I 'll have to go out there . Andre ? Yeah ? I need you two up here right away . Couple minutes . Fuck . Fuck . David ? Still here , hal . Remain on site . Linda and Andre are coming out . We 've got to check those bodies . [ Radio crackles ] There 's not much left . Well , find the ones in the best condition . Yes , sir . [ Rocks clattering ] [ Dog barking ] No way . I ain 't going out there . We 've got to retrieve them for analysis . Sue and David can 't do it by themselves . It 's not our job . Then I 'll go on my own . I 'll go . Get your gear . [ Ominous music ] * [ Growling ] [ Panting ] [ Dog barking ] [ Panting ] Ow ! [ Growling ] [ Whimpers ] Ow . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Dog barking ] Butch ? [ Shouts ] Butch ? [ Panting ] [ Growling ] [ Snarling ] [ Panting ] [ Screams ] That way . [ Growls ] [ Dog barking ] [ Panting ] [ Ominous music ] * - [ growling ] - [ Panting ] [ Dog barking ] Butch . [ High-pitched whistling ] [ Growling ] [ Dog barking ] Stay here . [ Suspenseful music ] * It 's a human ! [ Breathing heavily ] Stay , butch . [ Whispers ] It 's all right . I 'm not gonna hurt you . What 's your name ? [ Whispering ] Come with me . You 'll be safe with me . Mojave lab . [ Radio crackles ] Mojave lab , David here . Where in the hell have you been ? Playing hide-and-seek with a gargoyle . Tell Linda I got a present for her . Stop screwing around . I 'm not screwing around , hal . We got a survivor . A survivor ? Affirmative . Female , young . Get back here just as fast as you can . You got that right , boss . [ Quietly ] We really need to take care of this . Sue , let 's get her out of here . Come on . Come on ! [ Beeping ] [ Alarm blaring ] Hi , my name 's Neil . Take it easy . Come on , let 's get her down to medical . Sure am glad you brought her in . No way I was going out there . Yeah ? You owe me one . - Anytime . - Yep , anytime . Okay , let 's lie you down . I just want to take your temperature And get a blood sample . Now you relax . This won 't take very long . Sue , check her pulse , please . I still don 't understand how she survived out there Without the vaccine . Well it 's not important , hal . The point is , if she can survive out there , We can survive out there . In that campsite , David , How many dead ? [ Suspenseful music ] * [ Growls ] [ Alarm blaring ] They found the shack . [ Alarm blaring ] Hatch lock topside has been destroyed . - We 've lost our eyes topside . - We know . Better get up there and check that hatch . Andre , I 'm gonna need this camera operational Just as soon as possible . Gonna take some time . We 're gonna have to jury-rig something . No , we won 't . I got an idea . [ Alarm blaring continues ] All right , I need some drain pipe . Over here . Cut me a four-foot piece , will you ? You better know what you 're doing , man . Neil , don 't you think you ought to measure it first ? All right , it 's gonna work . Maybe . You 'd rather go up there ? Maybe . You always got to repeat everything he says ? Me ... fuck you . [ Laughs ] Are you getting anywhere ? Well , she 's got a very high " t " cell count , So she 's definitely been exposed to the plague And somehow survived . But there 's something else . She 's pregnant . You 're certain ? Yeah , I ran two additional tests . Now , I haven 't dealt with a pregnancy since med school , But I 'd guess that she 's about three months along . Well , that 's all we need is another mouth to feed . Don 't you see it , hal ? She 's been exposed to the plague , And she 's gotten pregnant . It means there 's still a chance for us out there . If it 's normal . You know I can 't do an amniocentesis here . I 'm not set up for it . Then we 'll just have to wait and see . Um , does sue know ? No , not yet . Then let 's just keep this between you and I Until you know some more . That doesn 't seem to be very fair . I just don 't want to get her hopes up In case we have to terminate it At the first sign of abnormality . We just don 't have the resources here to do anything else . Okay . [ Creaking ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Door clanks shut ] [ Alarm blaring ] Damn , I wish we still had those rifles . I don 't know . It might piss him off . All right , we 're at the ladder . So far so good . I 'm going up . [ Foreboding music ] * [ Growling ] Oh , shit . [ Growling ] [ Whispers ] Christ . Hal , they 're up there . We can 't replace the cameras . Then set up the microphone . At least we 'll be able to hear them . Yeah , right . You go . Uh-uh . Get your ass up there . Come on , man . I 'll give you a cigar . No way . How about a pint of shine ? [ Sighs ] You 're lucky I give credit . Give me the wrench . You got it . [ Growling ] Give me the mic . [ Pounding ] Come on , the mic ! David , what 's going on up there ? I bet you can 't read the no vacancy sign . [ Pounding ] Hurry it up , man . Jesus , the thing 's gonna get in here . Would you relax ? Come on . Hurry it up , man . [ Pounding ] Neil , open up ! Come on , man . Move it ! Open up ! [ Alarm blaring ] Man , I thought that you and me were history When that arm came through . It was two fingers , man . Yeah , it was enough . Now , about that pint of shine . That 's a plan . [ Laughter ] I 'm not going back out there . [ Banging ] Anything in there ? Yeah , the guy who kept it was named Randall Morgan . He had three kids : Roger , Marie , and Karen . He lost his wife and two of his kids to the plague . I couldn 't figure out why he and Karen were spared . In any given population , There 's bound to be a few with natural immunities . I guess they were the lucky ones , huh ? Some luck . Anyway , it 's clear from the photos we found Karen . But that 's not all . Linda and hal have been hiding something from us . That figures . I pulled Karen 's data from the computer . David , the girl is three months pregnant . That 's impossible . Can you imagine ? What a change , having a kid running around this place . What 's wrong ? What if it 's not one of ours ? You 're crazy . Linda would know if something were wrong . And according to her data , everything is fine . I hope she 's right . Christ , a pregnant woman . Mm , I 'll drink to that . Cheer up , Uncle Dave . [ Door rattles open and shut ] Hello , Karen . Karen . It 's a pretty name . I brought you something . You 're so lucky . You 're gonna have a baby . You don 't know anything . Why are you so scared ? You 're safe here . No , I 'm not . Would you just go away ? Go away and leave me alone . [ Door rattles open and shut ] [ Twinkling music ] * Mojave lab calling rocky Mountain lab . Listening 145.5 . Mojave lab calling rocky Mountain lab . Listening 145.5 . Mojave lab calling ... [ Radio crackling ] Mojave , this is rocky Mountain . Transmission level three . Repeat level three . We are under gargoyle attack . [ Mumbling and static ] Rocky Mountain lab , this is mojave lab . Your transmission garbled . Repeat , your transmission garbled . Say all after suffered . At least we know they 're still there . [ Sighs ] Yeah , maybe . Mojave lab calling rocky Mountain lab . Your transmission garbled . Repeat , your transmission garbled . Say all after suffered . We 've got a major problem . The girl . It 's like her pregnancy is in fast-forward . Last night she was three months pregnant . This morning when I checked her , I 'd swear she was seven or eight months along . That 's not good . Linda ? It 's obviously abnormal . We can 't take any chances . I guess we 'll have to get rid of it . If possible , we ought to keep the fetus alive For further study . If it 's that far along , we may be able to examine it . How 's the girl doing ? Her name 's Karen , and she 's doing much better . Sue , I 'm gonna need you to help me with the anesthesia . But I don 't know anything about ... I made up a card with all the right parameters on it . I 'll explain everything before we start . [ Quietly ] Okay . I just hope you know what you 're doing . [ Machine beeping steadily ] Swab , please . [ Air hissing ] Pencil . [ Machine beeping steadily ] I can 't believe hal wants to keep this thing alive . You should know by now : Nothing stops science . Scalpel . Cut from here to here . Cauterize the incision . We need to separate the muscle wall . How 's it going , sue ? Right where it should be . Scalpel , please . Now the uterus . Okay , now reach in . I can feel the fetus . [ Laughs ] [ Gasps ] Shit . My hand . [ Gasps ] Hal . Hal . Hal ! [ Screaming ] [ Growls ] [ All screaming ] [ Growling ] [ All screaming ] Holy shit , it 's in the air vent . [ Gasps ] Oh , my God . Karen ! Andre , lock him off . [ Beeping ] God damn it . Half of ' em ain 't closing . Well , Christ , we got to lock it off . They can 't get back up here , but ... damn , We were gonna do maintenance on this system next week . The only way to turn the others off is manual . Is it sealed off yet ? No , Murphy and his goddamn law is shitting all over us , hal . You guys better get in here . Let 's think this through . It can 't get in at this level , So what are the options ? Check level by level . Seal them off one by one . Send it down to storage on level four . Then gas the area . We ought to try and catch it . No way . We should kill it . Now , wait a minute . A premature fetus isn 't a ... Isn 't what ? A threat ? When 's the last time you saw A premature fetus move like that ? I did some calculations on the computer . And going by the growth rate of her pregnancy ... You can 't theorize from that . It 's the only database we have . I say we kill it . We have to expect the worst from now on . Yeah , damn right . Damn right . All right . We 're gonna need some weapons . Andre , Neil , you got any suggestions ? The welding gear . We could rig something from that . Turn it into a crispy critter . Yeah , torch the fucker . Yeah , that means getting in real close . You ready to do that ? There 's something else we can use . The surgical lasers ... If we could create a portable power source . Radio batteries . If the power drain isn 't too bad . How long would that take ? Two hours . If it maintains the same growth , It will be at full size in 24 hours . You got 45 minutes . [ Fire blasts ] All right , it works . Whole damn four feet . Definitely within grabbing range . This thing will eat fuel like a jet engine . [ High-pitched buzzing ] Check this out . [ Gun zapping ] [ Liquid rushing ] Ooh , just like a hot knife in butter . It 's definitely lethal . Oh , Jesus , look at that . It 's a quarter of the juice just like that . A quarter of the juice . That 's only four shots before you hit zero . That sucks . Okay , two teams . One with the welder , and one with the laser . The welding team is gonna start here on level two . If it 's there , and you can 't kill it , Try and drive it down to level three . We 'll be waiting there at the outlet . If we can 't get it , We 'll try and drive it down to level four . There 's only emergency lights on four , So watch your steps . If it gets that far , we can seal off level three . Then we 're gonna follow your suggestion and gas it . Any questions ? Yeah , what 's the teams ? You two take the welder to two . David , you and I with the lasers to three . We need the mutt on two , don 't we ? Sniff out the little bastard . - Makes sense . - Yeah , that 's right . You take the dog with Andre . Neil , you come with me to three . - What about us ? - You stay here . Oh , come on . What , do you want to end up like Karen ? Wait a minute . You mean they 're after the women ? Thank you , Neil . Our problem 's not getting any smaller . Let 's get cracking . Be careful . I was never a good audience . [ Suspenseful music ] * * [ Quietly ] You ready ? We 're on level three . Everything 's okay so far . Roger . Getting ready to move along . Moving . [ Loud banging ] [ Whispers ] Oh , God . Hal , they 're back up topside . First thing 's first . We 'll deal with them later . All right , Neil . [ Banging ] [ Suspenseful music ] * Proceeding to shaft number one . Nothing yet . [ Foreboding music ] * Hal , we 're losing our monitors on level three . Be careful . Well , what else is new ? Thanks anyway . I told you about that government issue crap . We were supposed to fix that next week . Neil , open this door . [ Suspenseful music ] * Okay . Over there . Come on , man , that thing 's slowing us down . Yeah , any suggestions ? Yeah , why don 't you wait here at the corner ? Butch and I will go on ahead . I don 't think we should split up . What 's the matter ? You scared ? Yeah . Aren 't you ? If butch spots anything , I 'll be running right back for you . Yeah . It could work . I guess . Hal ? Under shaft number two . Roger . David , we 're right below you now . [ Beeping ] Hal , I just checked my room . Nothing . Going on to sue 's . [ Suspenseful music ] [ Snarling ] [ Dog growling ] What is it ? Just outside sue 's room . It 's definitely been here . Go , butch . Go find the little shit . [ Dog barking ] [ Banging ] Hey ! There 's something back here ! Butch , come ! Down there . Hal ? Yeah ? We heard something back towards shaft one . We 'll work our way down there . [ Suspenseful music ] * [ Beeping ] [ Metal clatters ] [ Suspenseful music ] * [ Growls ] [ Stammers ] Ah ! [ Screaming ] Oh , my God . Hal , it got Andre . What the hell is going on here , hal ? [ Quietly ] Easy . Hang in there , kid . [ Growls ] Ah ! [ Growling ] [ Whimpering ] Wait . No , sue , don 't ! It got David ! [ Growling ] [ Dog barking ] [ Breathing heavily ] Hal , sue 's coming down to level two . Damn it , I told you to stay in the control room . [ Growling ] [ Dog barking ] Take the elevator to two . Get sue and David back to control . Yeah , not without you I 'm not . I 'll be right after you . Go . I 'll cover you from here . Now go . [ Dog whimpers ] Butch . [ High-pitched whistling ] Butch , come . [ Growling ] Butch ? [ Breathing heavily ] Butch ? [ Quietly ] Butch ? Butch ? [ Dog whimpers ] [ Door rattles open ] [ Gasps ] Andre . What the hell are you doing here ? Come on , get back to the control room . The elevator . [ Beeping ] [ Roars ] [ Beeping ] [ Dog whimpers ] [ Screaming ] [ Roars ] Sue ! Sue ! [ Screaming and crying ] Oh , Neil . Hal , it got sue . Hal ? David ? Anyone come in , please . This is hal . The thing has got sue . What was sue doing down here ? I don 't know . She came after me . It 's got her in the elevator . On four . I 'm gonna get that son of a bitch . Hal , I 'm coming down . Butch , you stay here . We 'll be back for you . Let 's go . Hold it . It 's me . Where is she ? Level four . I don 't know how much is left in this , But you may need it . Ah , Christ . They could be anywhere in here . [ Groans softly ] [ Suspenseful music ] * Oh , my God . [ Splurches , growls ] Oh ! No ! [ Screaming ] [ Whimpering ] [ Fabric rips ] [ Yelling ] Wait . Get her out of here . Now . [ Gun zapping ] [ Growling ] [ Gun zaps ] I will mess you up , you ugly fuck . Die ! Ah ! Hal ! We got to go back ! It 's too late . There 's nothing we can do . [ Quietly ] Now let 's get her out of here . [ Growling ] How is she ? I 'm giving her a sedative . Is the elevator door locked ? Yeah , the level 's sealed off . What can I do ? Get some of those sterile wipes over there And help me clean her up . How 's he doing ? He 's all right . Sue ? She 'll sleep for a while . Let me have a look at that shoulder . [ Groans ] Sorry . I know it hurts . [ Groans ] Hang on . David ... How long have you and sue been sleeping together ? Don 't look so surprised . Can 't hide something like that in a place like this . About four months . Why ? Were you using anything ? She told me she was . What 's all this about ? Come on , Linda . She 's pregnant . How far along is she ? A month , A little bit more . But it attacked her . If she was already pregnant , then it couldn 't do anything ... How do you know for sure ? I don 't care what kind of genetic mutation created them . There 's no way it can happen that fast . It 's all right , sue . It 's all right . [ Breathing heavily ] How long have i ... You 've been out for the last four hours . Now just lie still . The drug 's still wearing off . Last thing I remember , I was ... [ Whispers ] Oh , God . Oh , God . Shh , it 's okay . It 's okay . It didn 't get you . [ Sobs ] Yes , it did . Yes , it did ! Sue , sue , it couldn 't . Sue , you were already pregnant . Why didn 't you tell me ? You must have known . I didn 't tell you Because there was nothing to tell . You 're wrong . You are pregnant . There hasn 't been enough time . I wasn 't pregnant . I didn 't have any symptoms . You thought it was something else . We 've all been under a lot of stress lately , right ? You 're wrong . Both of you , you 're wrong . Come on , David . [ Whispering ] Let me deal with this . She 'll be okay . Just give me a minute . [ Quietly ] Linda , I know it 's not David 's . Please , get rid of it . Sue , there 's no way . There 's no way it could be human . You can 't know that . I do . I do know that . You got to get it out of me . Please . [ Whimpers ] Please . What if you 're wrong ? What if I 'm right ? There 's nothing I can do right now . You 're still too weak . Whatever happens , you 're gonna need some rest . I want you to take these . They 'll help you sleep . Now , we 'll be just down the hall in control . Take them ... Now . Don 't worry , sue . I won 't let anything happen to you . [ Beeping ] We 're almost out . We 're gonna have to go out there soon . [ Clattering ] Any bright ideas ? I 've been trying to figure out why I could move around On the outside without getting in too much trouble . First , I thought it was butch . It turned out , they don 't like him , But he doesn 't scare them away . That 's not gonna help us . Anything else ? It moves around in the air vents , right ? Yeah . If I could get in there , maybe I could trap it Or at least seal it off . And what if it shows up while you 're in there ? Well , I ain 't sticking around to smell his breath . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Sighs ] [ Alarm blaring ] Coming down towards level two . [ Alarm blaring ] I 'm at the power supply on level two . There are some bare wires here . Looks like Andre was doing some work . I 'll try to close the air vent . [ Lever creaking ] [ Mechanical humming ] [ Loud thud ] [ Suspenseful music ] * David ? [ Radio crackles ] David ? David , what 's happening ? Keep talking to me . I just saw him , level two . He ain 't getting any prettier . I 'm coming up . Any luck with that air vent ? No . Damn it , it 's stuck . Can 't seal it off . Christ , this is great , just great . Look , I 'm gonna try the rocky Mountain lab . Couldn 't hurt . All right , if you need me , I 'll be in medical . Rocky Mountain lab , this is mojave lab calling . Listening 145.5 . [ Sighs ] Rocky Mountain lab , this is mojave lab calling . Listening 145.5 . David ! Christ , what happened ? She wouldn 't wait . She tried to do it herself . Dab it , please . Oh , God , it ripped her . It fought the drug she used ... Ripped her from the inside . She knew all along . She was right . [ Solemn instrumental music ] * [ Sighs ] Damn . If the rocky Mountain lab 's setup 's Anything like this place , There 's no wonder we 're having trouble . There 's just no damn way to seal the thing off Short of blowing up the whole lab . I think I may have found something that 'll help us out . Their ears are very sensitive . Their hearing range may be up with butch , even higher . You use that thing to control butch , don 't you ? What ? The whistle ? Yeah . What happened when the gargoyle attacked butch ? I don 't know . I was around the corner . I couldn 't see it . I called him ... with the whistle ? Yeah . Then what happened ? [ Sighs ] By the time I got there , it had disappeared . The gargoyle heard the whistle . The sound hurt its ears . Wait . No , that 's it . That 's got to be it . We can use that to disable it down here . But how are we gonna do that ? With the intercom . I can make a tape , Play a continuous loop of the whistle Over the loudspeakers . It won 't hurt us . We won 't be able to hear it . Yeah , but we still got to find the damn thing . All right , well , I 'll make the tape . We 'll figure it out after that . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] * Homemade mace . At close range , it should slow him down . All right , when I get to level two , Turn that tape on . Okay . If anything happens ... They won 't take me alive . You 're doing a terrific job . [ Suspenseful music ] * Entering level two . Turn on the tape . [ High-pitched squeaking ] Okay . [ High-pitched squeaking ] [ Yelling ] [ Electricity buzzing ] Main hall 's empty . Coming up on hal 's room . [ Doors clattering ] Either it 's been here , or hal 's the slob of the year . That tape 's on , right ? Right . I just wish I could hear it . [ Growling ] I 'm at the mess hall . Entering . [ Tea pot whistling ] Jesus . [ Tape whirring ] [ Growling ] [ Electricity zapping ] [ Door creaks ] [ Electricity buzzing ] [ Tape whirring ] [ Beeping ] Just checked my room . Still locked .

[ Tape whirring ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Suspenseful music ] [ Fire whooshes ] [ Explosion ] Ah ! [ Gasping ] David , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Just get the sprinklers on down here . - David ? - Here . Circuits are jammed . I can 't get the damn thing to work . That 's great . I 'm a doctor , not an engineer .

I know it 's risky , But at this point , we don 't have much choice . [ Pounding ] [ Growling ] [ Pounding ] You ugly son of a bitch ! [ Snarling ] [ Gasping ] [ Growling ] Ah !

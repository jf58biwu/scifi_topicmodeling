Bits K. Gevorkyan U. Yakovlev Hi Hi what 's new ? Manohin had a pipe burst at the factory How 's the star schoolboy ? He 's out playing ... Vovka , pop out for some bread - I forgot it , can you ? And I don 't think there 's enough macaroni Comrade , that man says he 's from another planet ; we need to do something . Call 03 I will call but he 's barefoot - he 'll catch cold Hello ! Hello . Excuse my bad smell . I 'm cold . I found this in an iron bin . Fine . Friend ! Tell me the number of your planet in the tenture ? Or at least the number of your galaxy in the spiral ? I got my contacts mixed up and now I can 't return home . We don 't know the number . We forgot , my friend . And now this lad will go and call information , and we 'll wait for him in the bakers , okay ? And put this on meanwhile ... Thank you ... Listen , my friends . There 's no need for the bakers ... no need for information . This is my planet ... 247 in tenture , galaxy Beta , in the spiral . With this machine you travel in space ... So which co-ordinates do I press in order to travel home ? You see time is relative - do you understand this ? Let me make a suggestion . We 'll just press this contact and travel to your home . But if this machine doesn 't work , then you travel with us to where we want to take you , okay ? No , you can 't ... You need to know ... Yes we can ... So what can you see ? Eh ? Sand ... So that gadget worked ... and that idiot , with his holes , he stayed behind ? Don 't worry ... There 's the sun , there 's sand , there 's gravity . Where are we ? We 're on Earth . Or ... Or ? No , let 's take it we 're on Earth , in some desert ... So ? Karakumi ? Eh ? What other deserts do we have ? Gobi , Sahara ... No , I said OUR deserts ! The only other one is the Kyzylkumi . No . Let 's take it that it 's the Karakumi . Eh ? So that means ... The sun 's in the west ... so , Ashabad is this way . Understood ? let 's go ! Let 's go ... let 's go ! Comrade , what 's your name ? Vladimir Nikolaevich . And I 'm Gedevan . Pleased to meet you ... You have a bottle in your bag , is it wine ? No , it 's wine vinegar . And some herbs - coriander . So we 'll live well . Vladimir Nikolaevich , do you remember what number was given by the guy who took my socks ? No . Only maybe we 're on the planet , he came from ? Listen , Skripach ! Whatever we guess , it 's all the same and won 't change a thing ! Now we choose a direction and go . The most important thing is to reach water . Alright ? Vladimir Nikoaevich , I want to put my slippers on . Well , put them on ! Then wait ! What 's the time ? Four . In the morning ? Yes ... Are you late ? I feel uncomfortable ... I phoned the airport to say I 'd be there in an hour . And here we are ... Are you studying at the conservatory ? No , it 's someone else 's . Professor Rogozina . He gave a harvest concert for us , and they forgot to put the violin in the plane . A banquet ? No , dinner ... Ah ! Are you from Tibilisi ? No , Batumi . I thought I 'd return the violin , and still have time to catch the train . I study textiles in Ivanova . Aha ... So first I went to MGIMO to return it , to the institute of international relations , but they told me there that ... Quiet ! ... A man ... Hello ... American ? Do you know any languages ? English . Some French . Tell them we have no money ... Tell them we can 't pay them . Hello ! We are from a group of tourists and we 've strayed from the group . Take us to the town , and somehow we 'll regroup ... . . Do you speak English ? Parle francais ? Hello .. Do you speak English ? Parle Francais ? ... Sprechen Sie Deutch ? Chatl ! No money . Money , documents , currency - all left with the tour guide . So , that 's the result ... we turned our backs for a minute and ... disappeared in the sands . Take it . It 's warm . Excuse me , what ? You want my hat ? I 'm sorry ... it 's somebody else 's , I can 't give it away ... There 's nothing in there . Open it . It 's not wine , it 's vinegar . Sour , eh ? Well friend so it 's agreed ? You 'll take us ? Skripach , quickly ... Like I said we must get to the nearest town , and here 's a way we can get there ! The jacket now ... A good thing they don 't want the violin . Now they feel ashamed ! Ktse ! What do you mean ' Ktse ' ? He seems to want the matches . You want the matches ? There . The whole box ? Take us away from here , and we 'll give you ' koo ' . Not one letter to identify where it 's made ... Excuse me , I don 't understand ... Do you speak Turkish ? What do they want ? They want Koo ! Tsak ! Thank you ... He wants me to wear the bell . Too bad . I 'll wear it , Vladimir Nikolaevich , if it makes him happy ... Go ahead ! All right , I 'm persuaded . I 'm going to light up , if that 's all right with you ... Quiet , quiet , quiet ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , maybe we really are on ... Yes ! Typical Martians . Lusenka , darling , pest , it seems to you these ... macaroni . So . We know Russian do we ? Why was it necessary to conceal it ? Well we didn 't conceal it . It 's very difficult to fathom a language when straight away you 're thinking in two languages . And that Patsak is talking all the time in languages the rest of which he doesn 't know . Why are you staring at me , maimoona verishvilo . They know Georgian too ... What did he say ? Ape son of a donkey . So . We 're from the Soviet Union , here on a cultural exchange . They know us , and where we are , and can find us . If you 're not prepared to let us contact our embassy there will be large scale repercussions , is that clear ? We don 't understand ' embassy ' , put on the bell quickly ! That means you understand macaroni ... you understand maimuni ... but you don 't know what 's an embassy , idiots . I 've had enough ! You 're morons , understand ? You thought about macaroni and I just repeated it . This is not the Earth , and not Africa , my friend . It 's the planet Pluk , 215 in tenture . In the galactic spiral of Kin Dza Dza . Do you understand ? How do you do ? Let 's go ... Wear the bells , my friend ... Wear them . There we are , well done . Excuse me , where are we ? Sh ! She has very sensitive ears . Do you know the tenture of your own planet ? Tenture ? Well , tell me the number of your galaxy in the spiral . In the spiral ? In the spiral . The spiral ... Yes ... You know where the earth is . It orbits with such planets as er ... Venus , Saturn , Mars , Jupiter ... What others , Vladimir Nikolaevich ? The Great Bear . Vladimir Nikolaevich - come here . On your planet do you have more matches ? Well , you 'll find them . How many will you give us if we set you back there ? How many do you need ? Two packs like these ! Seven ! Seven . But give us what you have now , I will buy a gravitsapa from them . Sorry , but what is a gravitsapa ? Without a gravitsapa a pepelats can only fly like this , but with one you can reach any point in the universe - in five seconds . My friends , how is it that you bring a pepelats without a gravitsapa from the garage ? It 's not in working order . We had a gravitsapa . But when we arrived here , it broke down . Aha . But don 't you have a transference machine ? No . No . Give me the matches . Give us some water . Like this ! You need to do this ! Foo .. You need to do this ! Foo ... Do this ... Foo ... It 's yours , now smoke like this . Thank you . He says there they have a gravitsapa . Put your matches here . Here 's what we 'll do . When you put us on the earth , you can have them ... What do you mean ? Come on , Skripach , to the open cosmos . Wait ! Come back . Come back ! On mother earth you 'll get them . Vladimir Nikolaevich ! You said if we take you , you will give us them all . But then you stole this match from us . Patsak doesn 't cheat patsak it 's not nice , my friend ... I said - take us to the town ! And what 's this ? A shed . And what 's this ? What 's this ? What 's this here - not a town ? ! You 're trying to make fools of us . Show us your gravitsapa . It 's a trade thing . We 'll take it . Patsak ! What kind of idiots have I got here who give me contraband ktse in front of witnesses when for that you 'll get life imprisonment lying on nails ? Have you got a brain in your head or Kyoo ? We 'll buy it ourselves . Come on . Stop ! Stop I say ! Who are you ? I asked , who are you ? The new foreman . No . You 're a patsak . And who are you ? I 'm a Georgian . No , You 're a patsak too . You 're a patsak , you 're a patsak and he 's a patsak . But I 'm chatlanian , and they are chatlanian . So you wear the tsak and sit in the pepelats , understand ? What ? Watch when I point this device at myself , my friend ... which point registers ? Green . Now at him , watch - green too . And at you ... Green . Now look at Uef - which colour ? Orange ? Because he is Chatlanian ! Well , do you understand ? So what ? Pluk is the Chatlanian planet . Therefore we , Patsaks , must wear the tsak ... Yes , and in front of we Chatlanians you must do this ... Vladimir Nikolaevich , it 's unashamed racism . Show us again , please . Like this ! If you would , a little slower ... Like this . Vladimir Nikolaevich , you have a wife at home , a son doing badly at school , a cooperative flat you haven 't paid for , and you 're here ... you 're brain has gone . It 's ended pretty badly , my friend . Very well , Skripach , let 's play their games ... There we are , well done . Now give a match to Uef , and he will buy the gravitsapa . But it was said that you need them all . I was joking . Very funny . Wait . We 'll go together ... Don 't show them your ktse , and don 't think about them . You show them my ktse . And don 't give them more than half a match . Gravitsapa costs half a match . Your Patsak said a whole match . And he was joking . Grade 300 cement ? Patsak ! Remember - Half or less . Okay . Excuse me - Chatlanian and Patsak - is it nationality ? No . Biological factor ? No . From different planets ? No . So what distinguishes you from one another ? Are you colour blind , Skripach ? Green differs from orange doesn 't it ? Tourist ! Wow ! Skyscraper ! Come on ! do as we showed you ... Hello , citizen . You won 't feel the cold in that coat , eh ? They will keep me out . They will let you in . Don 't give them ktse , bring the gravitsapa here , and I 'll look at it . Come on ... Not you ! We 're together ! Not you ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , tell him ! It 's alright . Wait here . Only don 't go anywhere ! Hi ! How 's life ? You say , bow ... but out of respect for the ladies present ... Well what 's new on Pluk ? Lay down the ktse , and you 'll get the gravitsapa . Half ? Half . Can I look at it ? Look . In general I am not a specialist on these gravitsapa so let 's go and show it to my Chatlanian . He 'll examine it . Right . Let 's fit the Tsapa . Bad throat ? Water ... I have a proposal . I 'll give you that ktse ... and you give me two bottles of water . Agreed ? Let 's do it . Do you have any food ? Kasha ... What sort ? Plastic . So if I give you a whole ktse , you 'll give me five bottles of water and a kilo of kasha . For what ? Ktse . we need to check it again . Check it ! Oi , just a second ! Wait ... Skripach ! Can you obtain more matches on Earth ? I can . If you can spit this further , I 'll give you a half chatl . Like so ... spit . If I can , you give me two matches ... . Do you see ? No . It 's just a game . I give you half a chatl , you give me three matches . Go ahead , spit , my son . Thank you , I 'd rather not . Well fine . Give me one match , or I give you three chatla , yellow trousersand these odds . Go on ! No ! Blue trousers ... Mr Uef , I will not enter such terms and conditions . Are you going to change your mind ? Why are you annoying me , maimoona verishvilo ? Mr. Uef ! I represent a civilized planet , and I demand that you follow our lexicon ! Where are they ? Who ? The one with a scar , who I like an idiot gave all the matches to . Quiet , my friends . Enough ! Enough ? What do you mean enough ? I told him a thousand times we need to go to the centre . But he 's greedy , like all Chatlanians - ' for two chatlas cheaper ! ' Well there 's still one . As I understand it , enough for a gravitsapa . Give it to me . Here . Why ? To buy a gravitsapa . Where ? There , in the centre . And how will you return us to Mother Earth , when you don 't even know in which galaxy she orbits ? The number of your planet , idiot , any planetarium in the centre will give out for two chatlas ! So you 'll give me the match ? So you can cover us in sand ? So you won 't give it ? No . And you won 't change your mind ? That won 't happen ! Then goodbye , my friend . They 're going , Vladimir Nikolaevich . They won 't go anywhere , they 'll hang themselves for a match . Either you agree to give us that match , or we won 't take you to the Earth for less than seven boxes ! Two thousand . Three Two thousand three hundred Three Two thousand five hundred , I can 't give you more . You can , my friend . Mr Bee , I have 50 rubles , matches cost 2 kopeks a box , that means I can buy two and a half thousand ... Skripach you 're lying ! You have more chatls . Mr Uef ! I am not Skripach to you ! My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich ... what 's that , an engine ? Don 't poke your nose in every hole ! ... Gedevan Alexandervich ... Gedevan , let 's tie up these lads now , and take a course to the North . Why ? Maybe the shores of the Mediterranean are there ? Ha , so Vladimir Nicolaevich , you 've gone out of your mind , my friend . Where on Pluk is there a sea ? They made fuel from them long ago . Sorry , they made what ? Fuel , Skripach , fuel ... Now you owe us six thousand , one hundred and forty boxes . How has it accumulated so much ? You ate the kasha , you drank the water ... and took the bandura . No , delete the bandura ... we don 't want the bandura . Put it down ... Let 's at least take something technical , if not who will believe it ? Now give them the violin , if you like it so much . It 's an 18th century Italian violin , and cost 1000 rubles , if not more . How will I pay for it ? Skripac , instead of thinking that you 're the first Georgian cosmonaut , give back the spoon you stole from a poor artist . I never thought of such a thing ... I wanted to return it to the institute of non-ferrous metals , something new ... Heavens ! The heavens never saw such a disreputable Patsak as you , Skripach . I am deeply sad . Where are you going ? To the toilet . You can 't go to the toilet with money , money is left here . Gedevan Aleksandervich . Ktse are very dear , my friend . Why ? Well now , on Earth , how do you determine who should squat in front of whom and how many times ? Well , you just have a feel for it . Barbarian ! Listen , I 've started to like you , and I 'm teaching you . If I have a few ktse , I have the right to wear yellow trousers . And in front of me a patsak should squat not one , But two times . If I have many ktse , I have the right to wear crimson trousers , and a patsak should squat twice in front of me , and chatlanian say koo . And the Etsilop don 't have the right to beat me at night . Never . I have a suggestion , my friend . You give us the match , now , and we 'll then give you yellow trousers , okay ? Thanks , I have some already , perhaps Skripach needs them . Skripach ! Here are some interplanetary trousers for sale . Yellow ones . Do you want them ? Skripach isn 't here , my friend . Why not ? I ejected him . But you needn 't worry , Vladimir Nikolaevich we have another ejector seat . A new one . It 's all in order . I don 't understand ... I pressed the button - he flew . We don 't need Skripach , my friend , he only uses extra fuel ... Turn around ! Not possible ... Fuel is finished . We need to fly to the fuel station . Turn around ! Or this damned match will burn now ! Gedevan ! Skripach ! Skripach ! What can have become of him ? You 've been told . The etsilops have caught him . Well let 's fly , my friend . I could murder you ! Get in touch with the epsilops by radio ! But we don 't have a radio , we threw it out . I 'll be back ... I 'll take a look ... Epsilop ! Put on the tsak , quick ... put on the tsak . Leave it ! Put it on , or he will trankluk you . You and the match . Good day . Listen , friend , We lost a young lad here , you haven 't come across him ? What ? O ! Sorry , I forgot ... They said you picked him up . I said we don 't need Skripach . I said it . Now how do we buy luts ? How ? You 're a disease , my friend ... He 's worse . He 's just kyoo . Here 's a suggestion . We find Skripach , and fly to the local government ... Bring a little sand , my friend ... We tell him who we are , where we 're from ... They 'll give us a gravitsapa , and we 'll organise some mutually beneficial trade you give us yellow trousers and we give you as many ktse as you want . To fly to the government - we need to have a gravitsapa . The governers live on another planet , my friend . Uncle Vova ! I 'm here ! Here ... Skripach ! What ! And where ... My thing , what is it ... Tsak ? Well ? I have it . So give it to me ! Why here ? Well , just give it to me , I said ! There 's noone here . That 's mine . Alright , then keep it ready . You asleep ? No . Don 't lose heart , Skripach . If there is a gravitsapa on this Plyuk , we 'll get it . We 've got scarcer things ... Listen ! Eh ! Wait ! Listen , drop us off in the centre . Patsak ! Stop . What ? Don 't come any closer . Why do you want ? Take us to the centre ! ... Three chatlas .. No money ! But we 'll work for it ! And what can you do ? Me ? I can do everything ! And what exactly ? Vladimir Nikolaevich is a builder foreman , he can build you a house And what can you do ? Me ? He can play the violin ! Play ... Play . I can 't ! See you around , Patsaks . Woman ! Wait ! I can play ! Play ! Here ? There ! Wait a minute ... I can tune this up ... Play . And sing . Wait , wait ! How does it go ... Mama , mama , what should I do ? ... Cool ! What ? I said , ' Cool ! ' These people like it . What ? These people like it ! Let me be a drummer . How ? Foreman ! We don 't need Skripach ! Don 't worry , he can be useful . Give us some water to drink , eh ? I said , after the performance . And we could take it by force . Then you 'd have to ask us . Oo ! Touch me - etselop will come and pull off your legs . I don 't give a damn about your etsilop ! Calm down , Skripach . Don 't provoke the lady ... Foreman ! Look ... .. Alright , I understand . Listen , do you know anyone with a gravitsapa and a pepelats ? Why ? Well he could drop us off on Earth , and we 'd give you a big box of ktse , and him ... I understand that your people don 't trust words , well read what I 'm thinking that your wife is phoning the morgues . No , what exactly now I 'm thinking . What you 're going to give us . Then it 's the truth . What idiot on Plyuk thinks the truth ? Absurd ! So because you say what you don 't think and think what you don 't think , so you live in cages . All this bitter cataclysm which I see here , and Vladimir Nikolaevich sees too ... Patsaks have to perform in a cage , so we need a cage . Why show off ? Doesn 't matter , my dear , we will sing beside the cage . Get in the cage or he will see us , and will trankluk you . We 're not animals . What ? No you will come inside ! Come inside ! Let go ! You will get in ! Wait ! Get in ! Get in , or he will melt us ! Okay , get in Skripach . If she wants it that badly . Get in . One two three ... Dance ! Dance ... You know , try to find another ensemble ... my friend . What ? I 'll be back . We 've got to get out of here . Boys , push the cart , it 's uphill . The pleasure is ours ... Gas ! See you , bastards ! I will tell everybody where this buffoon PZh has led the planet . Patsaks have walked all over chatlanians ! Well , everything there ? She stole the eau de cologne . Women ! ... Hang on , is that lead you got there ? Let me , uncle Vova . I don 't even know which way to look . Where 's the Earth ? Galina Borisovna ! Comrade Mashkov and I , as patsaks , could receive two chatlas for a performance - it 's the maximum . Water , luts and fines for epsilops - a minimum of one chatl a day . And a gravitsapa costs half a ktse ! That 's two thousand two hundred chatls . Divided by 365 , take off Saturday and Sunday we get six . And that 's for those six years when I had no way of returning ! That 's all very well , Gedevan Alexandrovich , but these are just words . Where is the proof , that you arrived from the cosmos , and didn 't sell the violin , as Professor Rogozin alleges , and spent all this time in a disoteque in Garak ? Here 's some rock . Here 's a chatl . Here 's a tsak . And a nut and sand I attached to the explanation report and handed in to Dean Raechke , so that it could be sent to UNESCO . Where ? UNESCO . You are a grown man , Gedevan Alexandrovich . You study for one term and disappear for a year ! And explain yourself ... With some pebble , some piece of old Caucas ceramics , and a donkey bell ! A candidate for ... well , as to that , if you have musical talent , then why didn 't you participate in our amateur performers course ? You will excuse me , Skripach , but it 's elementary koo ! Part Two Short Chatlo-patsak dictionary . Ktse - matches Tsak - Little bell for the nose . Etsikh - Box for prisoners . Etsilop - Member of the Council . Pepelats - Interplanetary ship . Gravitsapa - Component of Pepelats motor Kyoo - Oath permissible in company . Koo - All other words . Hi ! Hello . Long time no see ! Bye ! Oi ! Hang on a sec ! I 've got a proposal ! What ? What ? What do we think of you ? Well ? Read out minds . Why do you stick to us ? What do you need ? Do you have no shame ? Do you ? We are poor , unfortunate , hungry artists ! What wrong have we done you ? Why do you tortment us ? Give your bandura here ... Tune up ... Like so . Come on . One two three . Mama , mama , what shall I do ? Mama , mama , How will I live ? I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have a warm vest . Shut it ! You 're tone deaf ! Mama , mama , what shall I do ? Mama , mama , How will I live ? Uncle Vova , let 's do it again ! They like it ... They understand . One two ... Etsilop ! Artists ! And where is our tub ? The pepelats ? Yes . There ... The fuel is finished . Because of you , pests . Skripach ! What are you doing ? Hooligan ! Listen , leave me in peace , okay ? My friend , it 's somebody 's last breath , a grave ... Mate ! You said you were ' second class ' . He 's a braggart ! Cheat ! You won by reading my thoughts . If you had a brain , you 'd be studying in MGIMO , And not here pissing everybody off . Want to play again ? For your violin , case and tooth stick ... And this ! Okay ? Okay ! From you the bandura , visator ... and the device you base your lives on , Mr Uef . Agreed . Let 's do it ! Uncle Vova ... You need to screw the tsapa in . Alright - you do it ! I 'm not allowed , I 'm a chatlanian . Sod off ! When it comes to advice , you 're all Chatlanians , When it comes to work , though ... Checkmate . Cheat ! You purposely thought bad moves for me ! Use your own brain for the game ! How can he use his own brain , When he 's just seen these dolls for the first time ? That 's not my problem . Give me my winnings . Yeah right ! Uef , did you ever see such a mercenary little patsak ? Never . I told you we don 't need Skripach , and here 's the result . Hey ! Boss ! ... You said tsapa ! Is it true nobody sings in cages on the Earth ? Mr Bee , on the Earth we only have animals in cages . Is an animal a Chatlanian ? I don 't know . They act like it ... Is a nightingale a Patsak ? Why a Patsak ? You said it sings without a cage . Well then he 's a Patsak . Ah ! So you see , you have the same open racism as here on Pluke . Only the Patsaks have taken power , not the Chatlanian , Just like you and your friend the nightingale ! Let me ... You can have four gulps . The water 's for the youngster . You owe us 6042 boxes now . Skripach , make a note . I already have . Do you want some ? No It 's free . Hey ! What are you doing ? And me ? And me ? And me ? And me ? I 'll still give you ten boxes , take some water for yourself ... God , Kin dza dza ! A ship ! It 's not a ship . It 's a fuel-station . So we can refuel ! We can 't ! This one 's automatic , but with a woman attendant . If we perform , she 'll give us a discount , understand ? Don 't hesitate , Uncle Vova . Come on , come on , my friend ... Come on ... If this was once sea , why are there no sea shells ? On the Earth you still have sea ? We have sea , and rivers , And honest people , Mr Uef . Savages . You make me want to cry . Mama , mama , what shall I do , Mama , mama , how shall I live , I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have a warm vest . It 's a pity my boss can 't see me now , He 'd probably give me a raise . Keep quiet , Uncle Vova . She 's watching us . They took the woman out and installed a machine . So take enough for the money you have . At least we 'll fly some way ! You can 't buy luts in parts . Luts is ten chatls per load , and we only have seven . How far from here to the centre ? 160 km . Uncle Vova , Uef has more chatls , In the right shoe ... Oi , Chatlanian ! What ? Can you take your right boot off for us ? Why ? You bastard ! All of you ! Squat ! Why ? They 're not epsilops are they ? It 's PJ with his Patsak . If they find out that you didn 't squat , It 's life in prison laying on nails . Who 's he ? You see that ? Yeah , it 's a hologram , my friend . The violin ! Quiet ! Stand still ! Silence ! And you say koo . It 's not a balloon , you idiot ! It 's the last breath of Mr PJ . Bollocks . How could one person breath so much just before he died ? Absurd . Don 't blaspheme . PJ is alive ! And I am happy . I 'm happier still . Like this . Come on , get inside . Plastic . No . Is there a normal entrance to this supermarket ? Normal entrance you have to pay chatls for , my friend . Get on with it ! Go away . Skripach ! Patsaks go there ! What are they doing ? This is the fourth pump of Mr PJ . I love PJ very much . I ' koo ' him even more ! And here they make water from fuel . What are they shouting ? Sell . Sell what ? Sell everything . So we 'll take a gravitsapa ! Gravitsapas are another department . First we need to find out the Tenture of the Earth . Yellow Trousers ... two times ' koo ' . Think ! What 's the diameter of you planet 's orbit ? I don 't remember ... Skripach do you know ? No , we don 't need Skripach . You ! All right . The specific gravity of the core of your planet . Think . Specific gravity ? No , I can 't remember ... I see . The names of the planets in your galaxy . Which ones do you know ? Think . Jupiter , Mars , Venus ... There was a crystal display ! Where is the crystal display ? Skripach ! Put it back in its place ! I thought as it was lying there it was a piece of glass ... Stupid idiot . Enough . Stop your brains squeeking , fool . Here 's the number of your planet : 013 in the tenture . On the left of the Great Bear . Do you want to talk with the Earth ? It 'll cost you another chatl . I don 't understand ? .. Think of your own telephone number ! And ask them about matches . ... Hallo ! Hallo ! Can you hear me ? speak here ... Hallo ! Hallo ! I 'm listening , go ahead ! Hallo ! Speak ! It 's timed ! Hallo ! Lucy ! Vova ! Can you hear me ? It 's me ! Vova , where are you ? Well , I 'm here ... How are you ? You ... How 's Cyril ? Where are you , Vo ... Where are you , Vova ? I 'm here , in some place , I 'll explain everything later . How 's mum feeling ? Have you been to see her ? I have been ... I asked you where you were ! Listen , wife of Patsak ! Stop pissing about ! Run and buy two boxes of matches ! Or else you 'll never be together ! Sod off ! .. Lucy ! Lucy ... Lucy . My darling ... Lucy ... Lucy ! Take the phone , right now , and ring Victor Manohin tell him that the keys for the plumbing store are in my portacabin , under the thingy ... under the cupboard . Lying on the floor . Did you get all that ? Yes , I got it ... Put me through to Batumi , 3-47-57 , please . Tell them to fetch Alec . No , I won 't . Piss off you bloody theif . Is something wrong ? It 's alright , only the Earth is so far way . Instead of five , the gravitsapa needs seven minutes to warm up . So let 's go and get the tsapa ready for the gravitsapa . Astronauts ! Which is the tsapa here ? This rusty nail , my friend . Yeah ! Everything here 's rusty ! And that 's the most rusty . Are you quite crazy ? Oh , mama-mama . Lucy and Manohin moved , and we need ... Uncle Vova ! The match is in his cap ! Strange , that they should fly off now . Why strange ? They 've got a match , can buy a gravitsapa , and know the Tenture of the Earth ! Comrade Etsilop ! Comrade Etsilop ! They 've stolen our things ! Arrest them ! Arrest them ! Forty Chatls . We 've no chatls . Everything is with the tour guide . And the violin they took is somebody else 's . And when they were in front of the video of PJ , They didn 't say Koo ! Why are you staring at me ? Why are you staring at me ? If your bosses find out that you knew of this and did nothing , You 'll be bloody trankluted ! Get it ? I didn 't do nothing ! I pressed the button straight away ! Skripach is a witness . All guards ! Bring a wheeled prison tub , here There 's nothing in it . Open it . Show me . It 's vinegar . It 's none of your business . The Patsak will be tranklukated , The Chatlanian will spend his life in a tub lying on nails . Oh , brothers , brothers . Fellow Patsaks . Tell the truth , how I squatted . How the Chatlanian pressed the take off button . Shut the fuck up ! Uncle Vova , please ... Shut up ! Parasite ! Shut up yourself ! Vova , friend ! Gedevan Alexanich ! Don 't listen to him ! Tell them that it was him ! He didn 't squat ! No ... And I 'll give the pepelats to you . Uncle Vova ! The pepelats is mine ! Mine ! Quiet ! Calm down ! ... Let me think . Nobody insulted anyone ... They all squatted , like monkeys . I was confused . And I brought the Ktse . What Ktse ? The match , which you took out ... from the hat . There wasn 't a match . There wasn 't . Uncle Vova , what 's the matter with you ? Forgive me , I forgot . There was no match . Never . Life imprisonment for both in a tub without nails . As to the fine . 500 chatls , 250 per place . Thank you ! Patsak ! Glue the violin and sing the song ! Skripach ! You work the bandura ! Friends ! We were joking about the violin . We were happy to reach you ! Hi ! On the river , on the river , on yonder bank .. Earthman , hello ! I can assure you , we will return to your planet . Greetings from Vladimir Nikolaevich Mashkov , builder from Moscow , and Gedevan Alexidse from Batumi , who are the first to set foot on these villainous sands established in this backyard . Brother Patsak , flip again your cover . You have some water there . Well give me something for it . Maybe sometime I can show you one of those who knew me and is still living . Ask him if I stole a match ... There ! Looks like new ! There 's still a little bit . It happens ... It will be ... High calorie ? Earthmen ! How could it be so difficult ? I could hardly find you . I got my memory back . Here 's your sock , thank you . If you want , I can return you to the Earth . I found out your number in the tenture . Only hurry ! For one second here is half a year there . Then I have a suggestion ... We transport to the Earth now , Procure some matches , Shoot back here and sell them , Bail out our friends , We go to Moscow , and you go home . I can 't . I 've only three charges . Well that 's okay . Enough times to go there back here and home again . And me ? Listen , friend ... Well work it out , yes or no , I 'll count to three ... One ... Two ... Wait a minute . Take my suggestion . It 's my fault they are in prison . And my little son has already grown an adult 's beard ! Two and a half ! Two and a half ! I .. I can 't do it . Three . Oh ! Who needs it all ? Tsak-schmak ! It 's all crap ! And we ... Where did you get that from ? Eh ? It was laying on a shelf in the planetarium ... Skripach ! You kleptomaniac ! You brought us a gravitsapa ! Patsaks ! Patsaks ! Why are you standing performing here ? You have to stand there . The Etsilops won 't allow us . You can only kneel here . So what if we 're here ... You 've still got to pay us . Alright , come on ... Come on , obey the rules . Uncle Vova , your jacket is coming , and my hat . Hi ! How are things ? Anything new happened ... on Pluke ? Sing ! We seem to be out of voice today . Sing ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , I can 't do any more ... Don 't worry , Skripach . How much is that ? One hundred . Seems like we 've sung enough . And what 's that there ? Fifty . Etsilpo ! ... Patsaks ! Why aren 't you wearing muzzles ? Turn round ! Orders of Mr PJ - all Patsaks to wear muzzles ... and be glad . So , that 's for me and that 's for you . And that 's for you . Why aren 't you glad ? I demand to know . Pick up your own gun , Chatlanian . Put them on , then ... I 'm doing it ... I 'm glad . Ho ho . Oh look , PJ 's coming ! Where ? ... Get up ! Get up ! Open your mouth ! Wider ! Skripach , gag ! Quickly ! Turn round ! Nose ! Give me the money ! Okay ... Make sure they stay there , like so ... And you can get rid of these ! If you think , that this idiot won 't tranklucate you , it 'll be the last though in your Chatlanian head ! Use the shortest route ... through the atrium ... arch ! Everyone lay down for half an hour ! Forwards ! Forwards ! Quickly ! Excuse me Grandma ... Mama PJ Did you see it ? Yes . Everyone quickly now ... in the pool ! Open the door . And stay there for 24 hours ! Do you Koo or not ? Here ... What number ? The last one . Hello ... Hey , Chatlanian ! Sing ! Finish , Skripach ... Wheel out the last but one . Vanish ! Hello , Gedevan Alexandrovich . Bastard ! Get out . I can 't . They 'll catch us . Stop ! We have a gravitsapa . Cut it . Right here . Throw your weight on it ! Uncle Vova ! Help me roll the tub out ! Leave it ! Vladimir Nikolaevich ! Because of one stone from the moon mankind wasted a thousand years , and here 's a living alien , and etsik ... made of an unknown metal . Leave it , I said ! Tsapa . We have a tsapa . Operate the tsapa ! It 's working ! So are we flying ? Seems like it . Brothers ! Be quick ! They 're after us now ! Don 't interfere . She 's landed . Where ? Hanut . And what 's Hanut ? The planet I was born on . And me . Night . It 's always night here , now . Time to put this on . Why ? There 's no bloody air . So how do you live here ? Nobody 's lived here for years . The Pluke 's trankluked it while we were on an expedition . Why ? Because we didn 't have time to do them first . And why would you want to do them ? So that they weren 't hanging over our heads . And everybody perished ? Of course . Vovka , I 've a suggestion . The planet Hanut is only worth kopeks now . 63 chatls . We go and sing ' Mama ' around the galaxy for a month , then the planet is ours . And another month - we can buy air . 93 chatls . There will be no air for anybody who comes here ... The air will be ours . They 'll be crawling around , and we 'll be spitting on them . Why ? For fun ! Where 's the fun in that ? You 're too young to know ... Half the planet 's yours , half ours . Okay ? Tempting , of course ... But we need the Earth , guys . We have to hurry . The supermarket closes in half an hour . Vovka , you don 't ... Just look . We 're here . And there 's the Earth . And here 's Alpha . They make cactuses from us on Alpha . Earth 's in the anti-tenture , my friend . And there 's no way that we can reach it , understand ? How 's that so ? Just is . All my life I never went . It 's not possible for a pepelats to get to Earth . Enough of this bollocks ! Is it clear ? Let 's divide the planet up . You found this out in the planetarium ? Yes , my friend . ... therefore you stole a match ? Of course . They 're lying , Uncle Vova . Don 't believe them . Now , take us to the Earth , that 's all ! No , Gedevan , they 're not lying . They 'd crawl across the whole universe for these matches ... Vovka ! You shouldn 't joke like that ... The oxygen here is two percent of normal . Gedevan ... You don 't need this . You 're young , you live a long time . Maybe things will change ... We don 't need Skripach , Uncle Vova . Hey , Patsak ! I don 't give a shit what you discard . Tell the truth for once in your life . Why didn 't you go with that idiot when you could ? What did you want ? Crimson Trousers ? PJ 's bathhouse ? Tell me ! Gedevan , you tell him . Or I can . I have a Georgian mother . Had . She says she is a local Georgian . Was . Uef ! How would you like it if I took them to Alpha . And you , scabby Chatlanian , wear the tsak ! And sit down when you speak to a Patsak ! Hanut is the Patsak planet , my friend . Repeat it again . You eject us on Alpha , and try to brake in its orbit , and then ... You won 't be able to brake there . Don 't interrupt ... Go on , my friend . On Alpha , when they transfer us to the Earth , we need to keep our fingers on the transference machine so that it stays with us . On Earth we can buy you four boxes of matches . Go on , friend . Well I could keep going on about this and that . Let 's go . If we can ... Because of you I 'll be locked up in a tub forever . And you have shown your laziness , once more . Brothers ! Dear , good , friend of mine ... So fly , even if the door is closed . I can 't stand looking at you any more , it makes me sick . Farewell , my friend . let 's go . Brake ! Brake ! Brake ! How can I brake when you drank all the brake fluid ? Alcoholic ! It 's ruined . Switch off your antlers ! They won 't switch off . Then take them off . They 're broken . It seems to have landed . Put on your gas mask . Just like last time . And the tsak ? No , we can do without it . Earth ! On the river , on the river , on those banks ... No ... not the Earth . Hello ! We 're Patsaks from the planet Earth . And you are ... ? This is the planet Alpha . Report your co-ordinates to the Decon , and she will transfer you to your point of departure . Good luck ! The number of your planet , if you 'd be so good . 013 in the tenture . Here it is ... Somewhere here straight ahead . There . To the left of the Great Bear . That 's not necessary . If you would , hold hands . Woman , what are you going to do with these ? Into the small room of the hothouse . Please . You ... Hold hands ! Do you really turn people into cactii ? Only out of Plukanians . Oh , but they 're not Plukanians . They 're Hanutians . That is irrelevant . Please put on the breathing masks . Why , your air is really nice . That is precisely why . God , just look at her . Ok , Gedevan . Calm down . Put it on . In the name of the planet , I 'm asking you to let them go . Who decides their fate ? Abrodox . But ... Take us to him . Otherwise I 'll take off my mask and start breathing . You shouldn 't worry . Our orangeries are very comfortable . Blossoming micro-climate , serenety . One could be jealous of it . Then why are you running around on the grass , and not inside in a pot ? Please look where you are going , you 've already squashed three plants . Friend ! We have a big favour to ask you . You can 't continue . No . Our misfortune is here in the neighbourhood of the galaxy Kin-Dza-Dza . They are consumed with fury . ... and depravity . To continue their lives in the form of plants would be a blessing for them . And everyone else . Can we send for them and ask them what would be a blessing for them and what not ? Well if we were to give them the possibility to make that decision , then ... Young lady , are you the most intelligent one here ? Do you do as your told , or what you decide yourself ? We can 't waste time with this . You are creatures of the anti-tenture , and I must send you to your point of departure . Or return you in time , to the moment when you made your fateful decision . Choose . Excuse me . I don 't understand . To what time ? The past ... to Pluke . So it 's like this ... Alone on Earth . Or together in the past ? Vladimir Nikolaevich , I won 't allow you on Pluke alone . Listen , uncle , set it for the past . What did it take , 15 minutes to glue the violin ? 15 minutes . Brother Patsak is coming with the sock . Let him transfer the etsik for us . Do you know where it is ? I know . Go on then , show us . Let 's give them something else to do . Everyone rest for half an hour ! Thank you , my friend . Play , play , peasants . Skripach ! Time ! Once again you haven 't transfered , Bastards . Again . Get out . Bollocks . It 's better for us here than on Alpha . Come on , drag them out . Quickly , bring us the transfer machine . Vladimir Nikoleavich ! You owe us eleven thousand boxes , as Skripach has noted . Eleven thousand and twenty . I have a suggestion . Vova ! We 'll transfer with you to the Supermarket now , and after you 've bought them all ... There won 't be any ' after ' . We can only go to the Earth . Forever ? Forever . Me on a planet where they don 't even know who should squat in front of whom ? Take the gravitsapa and do what you want . Uncle Uef . Uncle Bee . You 'll meet so much there ... No , Gedevan ! When a society has no coloured trousers to differentiate class , then there is no goal . And if there is no goal ... Brothers . Enough philosophising . He 's already made his choice . Now , decide . With us or not ? Here 's the gravitsapa , ok ? Give it to him . No point . Well , let 's say goodbye ... I got used to you , you know . Me too . Well , take care . Friends , Patsaks ! Here 's your sock , thank you . If you want ... Friend ! Which is your system ? Let me have a look . An ordinary system . Press the button and go home . Hi Hi - what 's new ? Manohin had a pipe burst at the factory . How 's the star schoolboy ? He 's out playing ... Vovka , pop out for some bread - I forgot it , can you ? Have we enough macaroni ? Comrade ... How do I get to the Old Arbat ? That way , to the right . Thank you . ... Skripach ? Uncle Vova ? ... Skripach ! Uncle Vova ! Mama , mama , what shall I do ? The End

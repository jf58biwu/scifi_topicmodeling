 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the Visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food ! The Resistance is all that stands between us and the Visitors . Come on , let 's go . Move it . Welcome , everyone , you 've reached your final destination . Another load of experimental creatures ? - Resistance fighters , huh ? - Ex-Resistance fighters . Nothing but lab animals now . You have the names of the Resistance leaders and their locations ? Good . - I want you to prepare another raid . - With pleasure . With that list I will eliminate your hierarchy ... and your movement will flounder and die . Take them to their quarters . Come on , let 's move it . Let 's go . Pick it up . Keep it moving . - I have to stop them . - Jonathan , no , it 's too dangerous . I love you . What are you doing ? What are you doing in there ? Hold or I 'll shoot ! Deadline for delivery has long since passed , Dr. Maitland . The viruses don 't grow overnight . There 's no way to speed up the process . I 'm growing impatient with your excuses . Look , I thought we had a deal , or has that changed ? No , you have my word . You develop the viruses for us , and you will go free . Fine . You think I 'm stalling because I like it here ? You think I enjoy turning innocent people into zombies ? Frankly , I don 't care whether you 're enjoying yourself or not . I need results . - You 're dismissed . I 'll be in my quarters . - Yes , sir . Jonathan . - Commander . - Jonathan , what happened ? The list . - Don 't try to talk . - No . The list ... Leaders ... In the volcano . The volcano ? I don 't understand , Jonathan . I want that traitor found immediately . Seize him . - What 's going on here ? - He 's a Fifth Columnist . Was a Fifth Columnist . Take him away . Perhaps you 'd care to tell me what this is all about . He stole the list . He was mortally wounded . He died outside the lab before Diana got to him . - Did she have him searched ? - Naturally , but she found nothing . I was there with the Head of Human Studies ... - a man by the name of Maitland . - Maitland ? A renowned human biologist known for his work with recombinant DNA . We have him with us aboard the Mothership . If Diana had him searched , and she couldn 't find that list ... Then it must be hidden somewhere aboard the Mothership . He did mention something about a volcano . A volcano ? Aboard the Mothership ? If Diana gets her hands on that list , the Resistance is dead . Any chance of your people on board finding it ? - Not without causing undue suspicion . - How about you , Julie , got any ideas ? - Julie ? You still with us ? - I 'm sorry . What were you saying ? I was saying we got no choice . We 've to go aboard the Mothership and find that list . I can arrange that . I 'll have false IDs prepared . Every precaution will be taken . You 'll come aboard as Visitor scientists . Now , time is of the essence . I 'll arrange to have Oswald meet you on the landing bay . - Are we awake up there ? - Yes , we 're awake . - Well , follow then . That way . - All right , Oswald . Go up a little , and now pull . - Hello ? - I hear you . Obviously , Oswald , you don 't understand ... the Feast of Ramalon is a joyous occasion ... and looked forward to by the vast majority of our people . Well , the whole idea makes me shudder . I suppose , next you 'll be claiming you object to orgies and random sacrifices . I have always steered well clear of bathhouses and barbarity . - You 're so pure , it 's disgusting . - Fortunately , it 's irrelevant . Ramalon is to be celebrated , and a good time to be had by all . All who survive it , at least . Oswald , you 're Head of Decoration , and you have to do your job effectively ... if you plan to be around after the feast . Well , how do we look ? - Like the real McCoy . - Yes . No one would ever guess that you are imitation lizard . But you must be very careful . We will be of no help to you up there . Don 't worry . No mistakes . You just remember this : If anything should go wrong , we don 't make it back , you 're the Resistance now . You 'll make it back . You will . But whatever happens , you can count on us . Good luck . I hope I 'm not intruding . It 's not like you to intrude , Oswald . - It 's important news , I gather . - Definitely . Your " sacrificial lamb " has been procured . The tender one is on his way to the feast , as it were . - Excellent . Is it the one I ordered ? - I 'm afraid it is . I do so hope you 'll remember those who 've served you well . Have no fear . Although , that might be hard for you to manage . No one will ever know of your little part in this amusement . Has James found the list of the Resistance leaders yet ? I 'm afraid not . He is really trying , though , the dear . Will you tell him that if he doesn 't find it within 24 hours ... that he , too , will join the sacrifice of Ramalon . It 's a shame about that list . If only we could find it , we could relax and fully enjoy Ramalon . If you will , Lydia , it will be one of your most memorable Ramalons . Well , your entry passes seem to be in order . So I 'll take you to the Director of Human Studies , in the X Wing . That 's Room 113 , I think . - Close shave . - Good thing we didn 't stop to chat . - Dr. Maitland ? - Yes ? - Excuse me for disturbing you , this is Dr ... - I know . We 've met . In fact , we know each other rather well . It 's been a long time , Doctor . I hope things have been well with you . The doctor and I worked together on human genetic patterning . - This is my associate , Dr. Gray . - Pleasure . I see . Well , they will join your team as assistants . We need all the help that we can get . To have such distinguished support is most gratifying . Well , I must be going . I 'm sure you 'll get along famously . I 'm sorry , Dr. Gray . It 's just that Julie and I ... - We 're old friends . - I get the picture . - You must be Mike Donovan . - And you , Dr. Maitland ? - You must be a collaborator . - Mike , please . Steven , you 're not a collaborator , are you ? You would 've turned us in , right ? It 's a long story . Bottom line is that I 'm trying to do , in my way , what you 're doing in yours . Talk 's cheap . - We could use some help . - I 'll help in any way that I can . I always would , for her . - Have I told you how much I love you ? - Let me count the times . - I really mean it . - I know you do . The first thing I 'd do when I 'm through with med school ... even before I start my own practice , is take you ... to the church and marry you , Julie Parrish . What about my life , Steven ? I believe in every single one of your causes . Passionately . - Wait a minute . We have to talk . Come on . - Not now . I 'm busy . We 're here to find something , Maitland . You don 't need to know what it is , but if you really wanna help ... you get Julie past the guards on the third level . I 'll take the fourth level . Nigel . Lydia , contain yourself . Philip , this is Nigel , my brother . Nigel , the Inspector General and our commanding officer . - Welcome aboard , Nigel . - Thank you , Inspector . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I 'm expected in the landing bay . - You sent for me , Diana ? - Have you uncovered the missing list yet ? Not as yet , but I can assure you ... The only thing you can assure me of is incompetent performance . Is she always that hard on the junior officers ? She won 't be with you , I promise . - I can 't tell you how glad I am to be here . - It 's wonderful to have you . How did you manage to get posted here , as young an officer as you are ? Sheer luck . Actually , Diana had a hand in it . - Diana ? - Yeah . She requested my transfer direct from graduation at the Academy . Soon as I got my commission . - When were you born ? - Don 't you remember ? - The ninth of Zendig . Why do you ask ? - I know , but what cycle ? The 11th of the 43rd sequence . What difference does it make , Lydia ? - That vicious , conniving ... - What , Lydia ? Who are you talking about ? Diana , who else ? What do you know about the Feast of Ramalon ? One of my favorite holidays . - We used to take the girls from the town ... - Listen , you fool . The Feast of Ramalon is based upon the sacrifice of the youngest warrior ... in this case , the youngest officer . Sacrifice ? Diana has brought you here to murder you . Your macho friend Donovan , you and he are ... We 're just friends . We don 't have time for anything but war . Friends , like we were ? Nothing has ever been like we were . Then why 'd you leave me ? I made a mistake . You did this ? No , they did . But I 've modified the virus so that it dies within 12 hours . These people will be fine . Talk to me , Steven . I 've been up here working for three months . Stalling the whole time . - I alter the virus before I use it . - How long will you go on fooling them ? I don 't think I 'll have to much longer . I found out where they keep the active viruses ... and I think they 'll trust me enough soon to let me down there , and when they do ... I 'll make sure that those viruses are never used . Let 's get out of here . I want you to promise me that you and Donovan will leave . We can 't . If they catch you , they 'll bring down the guards ... and I 'll never get to those active viruses . - I 'm sorry . - At least tell me why you 're here . I wish I could . Look , you 're just gonna have to trust me . Julie . I can see it : " Coed found roaming around men 's dorm . " Dear Steven , I 'm just not ready to be a housewife , I wanna be a doctor , too . Someday you 'll forgive me . I love you . Julie . Steven . Philip , I need your help . What ? What 's wrong ? Diana brought my brother here to murder him . Not even Diana is that foolish . You don 't understand . I don 't know how she did it ... but she had him commissioned a full year before his class was to graduate . I 'm sorry , I don 't follow you , Lydia . The Feast of Ramalon . He 's the youngest . He 'll be sacrificed . We must stop it . There must be something in the law . What about your love for ritual , Lydia ? For maintaining a sense of ourselves as warriors . You win , I 'm a hypocrite . Whatever you like ... but please don 't let her kill my brother . - There is one chance . - I 'll do anything . The feast can be stopped by a unanimous vote of the ship 's line officers . That 's you , me , and Diana . Personally , I 've always been against the sacrifice . - Thank you . - But Diana ... She 's a different matter entirely . You 'll have a hard time convincing her . I must . - What am I ? - You are my friend . And when I see you again ? I will remember all I hear ... I will remember all I see ... and I will tell my friend . Your friend would like that . She wants to know the names of all your contacts in the Fifth Column . Good . Take her back to her detention cell . I 'll deal with her later . I will tell my friend whatever she wants to know . Lydia , dear , how are you and your brother enjoying each other ? Fine , thank you . Diana , I ... Yes , dear . - About the feast ... - What about the feast ? - What do you want ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't play your cute cards with me , Diana . You set my brother up to sacrifice him . You certainly can 't blame me for the Feast of Ramalon . - It 's been around for thousands of years . - Stop it . Whatever it is you want , I 'll give it to you . Well , now that you mention it , there is something I would like . What ? Your life . Think about it . It certainly seems like a fair exchange to me . Juliet Parrish . - Any luck ? - Nothing on the fourth level . - We 've got to keep looking . - Let 's do it . I want you to comb every inch of the ship . I want that list found . - What are those ? - I don 't think you want to know . - They look like human brains . - Yeah , that they are . Your friend , Steven , does this ? Look , Mike , Steven is doing what he thinks best . He 's on our side . Maybe on your side , he 's not on mine . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Donovan . Julie . How nice to see you . - I 'm sorry , what did you call us ? - Playing the game to the very end . I 'm afraid we don 't understand , Commander . Don 't insult my intelligence . Please , don 't make me kill you . It would spoil all my fun . But we have priority passes and security clearance . It 's amazing , I 've been searching for you for months , now you come to me . I 'm sorry . I think there 's been some mistake . There is , and you 've made it . Take them away . With pleasure . Move . But why are we under arrest ? This is getting tedious . Sedition , armed revolt , and murder . We were sent here from the home planet . We just arrived on orders . - You 're human , forget this masquerade . - We are not . - We 're one of you . - Look . If there are no further questions , we have work to do . You 're dismissed . I don 't believe it . I want you to find out what 's going on . Who ordered the human masks for those two ? I 'll check it out in Operations at once . Someone has a distinctly warped sense of humor ... or a monumental death wish . - Will there be anything else ? - Only this : I expect you to be at the Ramalon officer 's sacrifice . - Of course . - It makes one appreciate what one has . - Did you see Diana 's face ? - I was hoping she 'd have a stroke . Good thing Philip got us these masks with the IDs . I hope you 're satisfied . The story 's all over the center . What 's your problem ? Until you arrived , this was a nice , quiet research facility . Sorry if we disturbed your experiments on human guinea pigs . Unlike you , my job is to save lives , not to take them . Gentlemen , we 're supposed to be helping each other . Come on . No , thanks . Come on , we 've got a list to find . I won 't run , Lydia . I 'm no coward . You 're not a coward , you 're a fool . It is an honor to die for the Ramalon . My name is gonna be inscribed in the Book of Heroes for all eternity . It won 't do you any good if you die . You won 't be able to read it . Don 't mock me , Lydia . It 's all I can do to keep my courage up right now . Mock you ? You 're the only living creature in the universe that I love . - Well , a little family intimacy ? - I think we 're entitled to that . This is going to be a magnificent Ramalon . Maitland has assured me that the virus is finally ready for release . This Ramalon , we will celebrate the final solution to the human question . Steven , I wanna talk to you . Diana knows about the fake masks . The guards are looking for you . - I can 't help it , I have a job to do . - What you 're doing is suicide . - And what are you doing , Steve ? - What are you talking about ? I just heard Diana say you 'd have the viruses ready for her . Whose side are you really on ? Well , who do you want to believe , Diana or me ? You asked me to trust you . May I ask the same from you ? Or have you forgotten who I really am ? I knew who you were a long time ago . But you 're not sure of me now ? I don 't know . Haven 't we sung this song before ? It 's a different verse , but the chorus is the same . I love you . I loved you then , I love you now . And I 'll never stop loving you . - I 'm doing it again , aren 't I ? - No . No , you 're not , it 's me . Why does everything have to be so damn difficult ? I don 't know . Do you remember when I took you to the Crab Nebula ? Do I ? It was right after you were decorated by the Leader personally . Those were the days of glory . Oh , Lydia , I was so proud of you . I wanted to grow up just like you . Honorable , compassionate ... a true warrior . You 've grown up better than me , Nigel . - I must speak to Philip . I 'll see you later . - Okay . Philip , I hope I 'm not disturbing you , but it 's urgent . What is it ? Diana suspects that you 're a Fifth Columnist . That 's ridiculous . You know , Lydia , such verbal allegations are very dangerous . - They could be construed as mutiny . - I know , that 's why I 'm here . Commendable , but tell me ... what do you think of her accusations ? At the moment , my only concern is for my brother . That 's unlike you , Lydia . Usually your only concern is for yourself . I know what I am , and I make no excuse for it . What are you ? Your commanding officer . No , it 's too dangerous . Besides , we 're not really sure the list is there . For once , I agree with him . It could be in James ' quarters . It 's the only place we haven 't looked . I 'll go . - You ? Alone ? - They 're looking for you . Somehow , you charming James out of his quarters just doesn 't quite make it . You know , no wonder you two don 't get along . You 're so much alike . Yes . Hi . You 're the one Diana 's looking for . I guess you caught me . Well , I guess I have . There 's going to be a big commendation in this for me . You 're kind of cute . I just really love you strong , scientific types . Diana tells me that you 're human . Human ? I 'll show you how human I am . Could you step outside that door , please ? Come on , you don 't expect me to get dressed in front of you . There 's only one way out , and it 's through that door . You 'll be right outside . Go on . All right . I 'll only be a couple of minutes . Take all the time you need , you 're not going anywhere . Sorry , darling . I just wanted to make sure that you weren 't wearing a mask . Why , darling ? Thinking of having some work done on yours ? You could use it , you know . Very tempting , Miss Parrish . I 'll have to indulge you some day . But , at the moment , I 'm after much larger game . Invite Philip to join us immediately . The Leader will be most intrigued ... to find out that yours and Philip 's treason are one and the same . There are Resistance fighters on board . I want all sentries doubled . - With orders , shoot to kill . - Yes , sir . It looks like we have no choice . We have to work together now . You 're right , under these circumstances . I wish I had a grenade or a gun . I had to come aboard clean . How about my lab ? I have some volatile chemicals down there . - I think we can come up with something . - Well , let 's hit it . Guards , come with me . Actually , Julie , it 's foolish of you to deny any of this . We know Donovan is here with you . I saw him . Are you sure it wasn 't a reptile in a Donovan mask ? I hear they 're getting extremely popular . You listen to me , you foolish human . All you have to do to save your feeble life is turn on the lizard , Philip . Confess that he organized this entire charade . Philip . I 'm not sure I know him . Is he attractive ? Why are you making this so difficult ? I just guess it 's my nature , Diana . Well , I can change your nature , Julie . Remember the conversion process ? Why don 't you just try to cooperate ? And in exchange , I 'll give you Donovan 's life and your own . But first , you have to find Donovan , don 't you ? That 's always been the hard part , hasn 't it ? That shouldn 't be too difficult . I have a feeling Donovan will come to you like mouse to a cheese . You see , you are my bait . You know , Maitland , I may have misjudged you after all . You are risking your life to save Julie . You know what they say : " You never know how much you love something till you lose it . " This time around , I intend to minimize my losses . But remember , after we free Julie , we must destroy the virus in that vault . Won 't they be able to just grow another batch ? No , it only breeds in the home planet 's atmosphere . Even with their sophisticated cloning techniques ... they won 't be able to mass produce it here without the mother cells . Careful . So , that 's what you 've been doing all this time . You 've been stalling them . We all show resistance in our own way . - I couldn 't take a chance of telling you . - Be careful . I think Julie 's right . We are too much alike . Let 's split . So , tell me , what do you think of these allegations ... that I would give aid and comfort to Resistance fighters ? Quite frankly , Inspector , I don 't care if the charges are true or false . I only care about saving my brother . Which can only be handled by the unanimous vote of the ship 's line officers . Except , Inspector , dear Inspector ... we seem to share similar needs at the moment . Now , I have satisfied yours by warning you of the spy that Diana 's brainwashed . I fully expect you to satisfy me . I hope that 's not a threat I hear in your voice . Inspector , please , would I threaten a superior officer ? I 'll do everything I can to help . I hope so . For all our sakes . Inspector , we have an emergency . Diana has requested your presence in the Ramalon room . Stay with her ! It 's Donovan ! He set fire to the whole lab ! What happened ? - Donovan 's been spotted in the laboratory . - Lead the way . Diana sent orders . You 're to return to the lab immediately . All right , don 't go . Well , it 's about time you got here . - The volcano ? - Yep . - And the list . Now what ? - Let 's get out of here . You fool . This was nothing but a diversion . I want you to seal off all exits and all corridors . There is to be no means of escape . Careful with those viruses . Any contact whatsoever could prove disastrous . If you 're done , let 's go . Hurry up . Tell me how we 're gonna get out of here ? Come on , follow me . Far enough ! No . This can 't be . This is impossible . The vault ! This will take us to the landing bay . Smile , Lydia . Your brother is dead , and victory is mine . If Philip had survived , he 'd have seen your victory turn to ashes . Please , darling . Sour grapes are out of season . - Hail Ramalon . - Hail Ramalon . - Hail our hero . - Hail our hero . Wait ! By what right do you interfere with this Throne Day ? By right of succession . I understand , Diana , that you 've made some accusations against me ... as to my loyalty . What proof do you provide ? Accusations ? What accusations ? You have no proof . Very well , then . I 'll be forced to consider it mutiny . Unless , of course , you 're willing to change your vote ... to comply with ours . - Ours ? - Mine and Philip 's . The ship 's three line officers . To what end ? To end this barbaric ritual . What else ? Agreed ? I said , agreed ? Take your brother . But you 're a traitor ! And I 'll prove it . - She 's such a poor loser . - She 's even worse when she wins . Not bad , Donovan . I didn 't know you knew how to fly one of those things . Maitland , maybe some time we 'll take a flight ... in clearer skies . It 's a deal . It will be over someday , won 't it ? And when it is , I want you to come back to me . I want to stay with you now , Steven . I don 't want you to even argue about it , Julie . Remember when you stayed last time , you couldn 't forgive yourself . Imagine how you 'd feel if you stayed with me now . - Steven . - And I want you to stay with me ... but you 're a doctor , a fighter , and they need you . Then come join us . I have my own tasks to perform . Like making sure that this complex is never rebuilt ... helping my staff and their families make it to the free zone . There 's research there that can be done to defeat the Visitors . Are you sure ? I think we 're both sure . Hey , guys . Wait for me . English

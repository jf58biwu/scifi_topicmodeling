 ANNOUNCER : October is inventory time . So right now , Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985-model Toyotas . You won 't find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley . NEWSCASTER : The Senate is expected to vote on this today . In other news , officials at the Pacific Nuclear research facility have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago . A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft . However , officials now attribute the discrepancy to a simple clerical error . The fbi , which is investigating the matter , had no comment . [ Buzzer blares ] MARTY : Doc ? Doc ? Hello ! Anybody home ? Einstein , come here , boy . [ Marty whistles ] MARTY : What 's going on ? God . Jesus ! That is disgusting . [ Marty muttering ] [ clocks ticking ] [ Machine humming ] [ Humming grows louder ] [ Humming grows very loud ] [ Dial clicking ] [ Electric guitar note plays ] [ Marty grunts ] [ Marty groaning ] Rock ' n ' roll . [ Alarm bell ringing ] MARTY : Yo . DOC : Marty , is that you ? Doc . Where are you ? DOC : Thank God I 've found you . Meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1 : 15 . I made a breakthrough . I 'll need your assistance . 1 : 15 in the morning ? Doc , what 's going on ? MARTY : Where you been all week ? DOC : Working . MARTY : Is Einstein with you ? DOC : Yeah , he 's right here . You left your equipment on all week . DOC : My equipment . That reminds me , Marty . Do not hook up to the amplifier . There 's a slight possibility of overload . Yeah . I 'll keep that in mind . DOC : Good . I 'll see you tonight . Don 't forget . DOC : 1 : 15 a.m. , Twin Pines Mall . MARTY : Right . [ Clocks all ringing , chiming , cuckooing ] DOC : Are those my clocks I hear ? MARTY : Yeah , it 's 8 : 00 . DOC : Perfect ! My experiment worked ! They 're all exactly 25 minutes slow ! Wait a minute , Doc . Are you telling me that it 's 8 : 25 ? DOC : Precisely . MARTY : Damn ! I 'm late for school . [ The Power of Love playing ] MARTY : Jennifer . JENNIFER : Strickland 's looking for you . If you get caught , it 'll be four tardies in a row . All right , come on . I think we 're safe . This time it wasn 't my fault . The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow . The doc ? Am I to understand you 're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown , McFly ? Tardy slip for you , Miss Parker . And one for you , McFly . I believe that 's four in a row . Let me give you a nickel 's worth of free advice , young man . This so.called Dr. Brown is dangerous . He 's a real nutcase . Hang around with him , you 'll end up in big trouble . Yes , sir . You got a real attitude problem . You 're a slacker . You remind me of your father when he went here . He was a slacker , too . Can I go now , Mr. Strickland ? Your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today . Why even bother ? You don 't have a chance . You 're too much like your old man . No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley . Yeah , well , history is going to change . Next , please . [ Synthesizer playing ] All right . We 're the Pinheads . MARTY : One , two , three . [ Playing Power of Love ] Okay , that 's enough . Thank you , fellas . Hold it , fellas . I 'm afraid you 're just too darn loud . Next , please . Next group , please . ANNOUNCER : Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson . Progress is his middle name . MARTY : " Too loud . " I can 't believe it . We 'll never get a chance to play in front of anybody . Marty , one rejection isn 't the end of the world . I just don 't think I 'm cut out for music . But you 're really good , and your audition tape is great . You 've got to send it in to the record company . - It 's like Doc 's always saying . - I know . If you put your mind to it , you can accomplish anything . That 's good advice . All right . What if I send in the tape and they don 't like it ? What if they say I 'm no good ? What if they say , " You got no future " ? I can 't take that kind of rejection . I 'm starting to sound like my old man . - He 's not that bad . - Save the clock tower . He 's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night . Check out that 4x4 . MARTY : That is hot . ATTENDANT : Back her up . Someday , Jennifer . Someday . Wouldn 't it be great to take that truck up to the lake ? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back . Lie out underneath the stars . - Stop it . - What ? Does your mom know ? About tomorrow night ? No , get out of town . My mom thinks I 'm going camping with the guys . My mother would freak out if she knew I was going with you . I 'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that stuff when she was a kid . Look , I think the woman was born a nun . She 's just trying to keep you respectable . She 's not doing a very good job . Terrible . WOMAN : Save the clock tower . Save the clock tower . Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock . Thirty years ago , lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn 't run since . We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved the way it is as part of our history and heritage . MARTY : There 's a quarter . WOMAN : Thanks . WOMAN : Don 't forget to take a flyer . Save the clock tower ! Where were we ? [ Car horn honks ] JENNIFER : Right about here . MAN : Jennifer ! It 's my dad . I 've got to go . MARTY : I 'll call you tonight . I 'll be at my grandma 's . Here , let me give you the number . 'Bye . [ Power of Love music playing ] [ Dog barking ] RADIO DISPATCHER : Bravo , Tango , Delta 6-2-9 . Tow for impoundment . Any unit , please respond . MARTY : Perfect . Just perfect . [ Biff speaking muffled ] BIFF : I can 't believe you 'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot . I could 've been killed . Now , Biff , I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it . Hi , son . BIFF : Are you blind , McFly ? How else do you explain that wreck out there ? MR. MCFLY : Biff , can I assume that your insurance is going to pay for the damage ? My insurance ? It 's your car . Your insurance should pay . Who 's going to pay for this ? I spilled beer when the car smashed into me . Who 'll pay my cleaning bill ? And where 's my reports ? I haven 't finished those up yet , but I figured since they weren 't due ' til ... Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ? Think , McFly . Think ! I got to have time to get them retyped . Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting ? I 'll get fired . You wouldn 't want that to happen , would you ? - Would you ? - Of course not . I wouldn 't want that to happen . Now , look . I 'll finish those reports tonight and I 'll run them on over first thing tomorrow . Not too early . I sleep in Saturday . Your shoe 's untied . Don 't be so gullible , McFly . Got the place fixed up nice . I have your car towed to your house and all you got for me is lite beer ? What are you looking at , butthead ? Say hi to your mom for me . I know what you 're going to say , son and you 're right . You 're right . But ... Biff just happens to be my supervisor and I 'm afraid I 'm just not very good at confrontations . But the car , Dad . [ Car driving away ] MARTY : I mean , he wrecked it . He totaled it . I needed that car tomorrow night , Dad . Do you have any idea how important this was to me ? MR. MCFLY : I know , and all I can say is , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . MR. MCFLY : Believe me , Marty , you 're better off without having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance . DAVID : He 's absolutely right . The last thing you need is headaches . [ Mr. McFly laughing ] [ David laughing ] [ TV audience applauding ] Kids , we 're going to have to eat this cake by ourselves . Your Uncle Joey didn 't make parole again . [ Mrs. McFly sighs ] It would be nice if you all dropped him a line . MARTY : Uncle " Jailbird " Joey ? He 's your brother , Mom . Yeah . It 's a major embarrassment , having an uncle in prison . We all make mistakes in life , children . DAVID : Goddamn it . I 'm late . MRS. MCFLY : David , watch your mouth ! You come here and kiss your mother before you go . Come on , Mom . Make it fast . I 'll miss my bus . DAVID : See you later , Pop . [ David exclaims ] Time to change that oil . [ Laughing ] LINDA : Marty . I 'm not your answering service . While you were outside pouting over the car Jennifer Parker called you twice . MRS. MCFLY : I don 't like her . Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble . LINDA : Mom . There 's nothing wrong with calling a boy . I think it 's terrible . Girls chasing boys . When I was your age , I never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy . LINDA : Then how am I ever supposed to meet anybody ? Well , it 'll just happen . Like the way I met your father . That was so stupid . Grandpa hit him with the car . It was meant to be . [ Linda sighs ] Anyway if Grandpa hadn 't hit him , then none of you would have been born . Yeah , well . I don 't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street . MRS. MCFLY : What was it , George ? Bird.watching ? What , Lorraine ? What ? Anyway , your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house . He seemed so helpless . Like a little lost puppy , and my heart just went out to him . LINDA : Yeah , we know . You 've told us this story a million times . You felt sorry for him . You decided to go with him to the Fish Under the Sea dance . No . It was the Enchantment Under the Sea dance . Our first date . I 'll never forget it . It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm , remember , George ? [ Indistinct chatter on TV ] Your father kissed me for the first time on that dance floor . It was then that I realized that I was going to spend the rest of my life with him . [ Mr. McFly laughing ] Oh , no . [ Music playing on radio ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Sighing ] Hello . DOC : Marty , you didn 't fall asleep , did you ? MARTY : Doc . No . No , don 't be silly . DOC : Listen , this is very important . I forgot my video camera . Can you pick it up at my place on your way to the mall ? Yeah . I 'm on my way . Einstein ! Where 's the doc , boy ? [ Einstein whining ] [ Machine humming ] [ Gate unlocking ] [ Mysterious instrumental music ] [ Engine revving ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Steam rushing ] Doc ! - Marty ! You made it ! - Yeah . Welcome to my latest experiment . This is the one I 've been waiting for all my life . Well , it 's a DeLorean ... All your questions will be answered . Roll tape and we 'll proceed . - Is that a Devo suit ? - Never mind that now . DOC : Not now . MARTY : I 'm ready . Good evening . I 'm Dr. Emmett Brown . I 'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot . It 's Saturday morning , October 26 , 1985 , 1 : 18 a.m. This is temporal experiment number one . DOC : Come on , Einie . Get in there . In you go . Sit down . Put your seat belt on . [ Einstein grunting ] MARTY : Okay . Please note that Einstein 's clock is in precise synchronization with my control watch . DOC : Got it ? MARTY : Right . Check , Doc . DOC : Have a good trip , Einstein . Watch your head . MARTY : You got that thing hooked up to the car ? DOC : Watch this . MARTY : Yeah . Okay . MARTY : Got it . Jesus ! Not me ! The car ! [ Tires squealing ] [ Engine revving ] If my calculations are correct when this baby hits 88 miles per hour you 're going to see some serious shit . [ Remote control beeping ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Remote control beeping ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Remote control beeping ] [ Tires squealing ] Watch this ! [ Beeping growing faster ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Doc laughs ] What did I tell you ? 88 miles per hour ! The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1 : 20 a.m. and zero seconds ! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ , Doc ! You disintegrated Einstein ! Calm down . I didn 't disintegrate anything . The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact . Then where the hell are they ? The appropriate question is , " When the hell are they ? " Einstein has just become the world 's first time traveler . DOC : I sent him into the future . One minute into the future , to be exact . At precisely 1 : 21 a.m. and zero seconds we shall catch up with him and the time machine . [ Dramatic instrumental music ends ] Wait a minute , Doc . Are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean ? - The way I see it if you 're going to build a time machine into a car , why not do it with style ? Besides , the stainless.steel construction made the flux dispersal ... [ Watch beeping ] Look out ! [ Tires squealing ] [ Remote control beeps ] [ Time machine steaming and creaking ] [ Doc gasps ] MARTY : What ? Is it hot ? DOC : It 's cold . Damn cold . [ Doc laughing ] Einstein , you little devil ! Einstein 's clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking ! MARTY : He 's okay . DOC : He 's fine . He 's completely unaware that anything happened . As far as he 's concerned , the trip was instantaneous . That 's why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine . He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time . I 'll show you how it works . First , you turn the time circuits on . [ Machine powering up ] [ Machine whirs ] DOC : This tells you where you 're going , this where you are and this where you were . Input your destination time on this keypad . Say you want to see the signing of the Declaration of Independence . [ Machine bleeps ] DOC : Or witness the birth of Christ . Here 's a red.letter date in the history of science . November 5 , 1955 . Yes , of course . November 5 , 1955 . What happened ? That was the day I invented time travel . I remember it vividly . I was standing on my toilet hanging a clock . The porcelain was wet . I slipped , hit my head on the sink . When I came to , I had a revelation . A vision . A picture in my head . A picture of this . This is what makes time travel possible . The flux capacitor . Flux capacitor ? It 's taken almost 30 years and my family fortune to realize the vision of that day . My God , has it been that long ? Things have certainly changed around here . I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see . Old man Peabody owned all of this . He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees . This is ... This is heavy.duty , Doc . This is great . Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline ? Unfortunately , no . It requires something with a little more kick . Plutonium . Plutonium . Wait a minute . Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear ? Keep rolling there . No , this sucker 's electrical but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need . You don 't just walk into a store and buy plutonium . Did you rip that off ? Of course . From a group of Libyans . They wanted me to build them a bomb . I took the plutonium and gave them a bomb casing full of pinball machine parts . DOC : Come on . Let 's get you a radiation suit . MARTY : Jesus ! [ Breathing distorted by suit ] [ Sucking ] It 's safe now . Everything 's lead.lined. [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] DOC : Don 't lose those tapes now . I need that as a record . Let 's put this back here . There we go . Almost forgot my luggage . Who knows if they got cotton underwear in the future . - I 'm allergic to all synthetics . - The future . - That 's where you 're going . - Right . 25 years . I 've always dreamed of seeing the future , looking beyond my years seeing the progress of mankind . MARTY : Why not ? I 'll also be able to see who wins the next 25 World Series . MARTY : Doc . Look me up when you get there . Indeed I will . Roll ' em . [ Doc clearing throat ] I , Dr. Emmett Brown am about to embark on an historic journey . What am I thinking of ? I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium . How do I expect to get back ? One pellet , one trip . I must be out of my mind . [ Einstein barking ] What is it ? [ Ominous instrumental music ] My God . They found me . I don 't know how , but they found me . DOC : Run for it , Marty ! MARTY : Who ? Who do you think ? The Libyans ! [ Man shouting in Arabic ] Holy shit ! [ Gunshots firing ] I 'll draw their fire ! Doc , wait ! [ Doc screaming ] No ! Bastards ! [ Shouting in Arabic ] [ Grunting ] [ Gun clicking ] [ Swearing in Arabic ] [ Grunting ] Go ! [ Engine stalling ] Go ! [ Tires squealing ] [ Engine starting ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Machine beeping ] [ Gunshots firing and ricocheting ] [ Shouting ] Come on ! Move ! Goddamn it ! MARTY : Jesus ! [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Holy shit ! Let 's see if you bastards can do 90 . [ Tires squealing ] [ Rumbling over ground ] [ Screaming ] [ Crashing ] [ Chickens clucking ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Dog barking distantly ] [ Door creaks open ] [ Car blinker clicking ] WOMAN : Pa , what is it ? What is it , Pa ? Looks like an airplane without wings . That ain 't no airplane . Look . [ Hydraulics hissing ] [ Muffled breathing ] [ Screaming ] Don 't look ! MARTY : Listen ... [ Cows mooing ] Hello . Excuse me . Sorry about your barn . [ Gunshot fires ] It 's already mutated into human form ! Shoot it ! Take that , you mutated son of a bitch ! [ Screaming ] BOY : Wait ! BOY : Shoot it , Pa ! MAN : My pine ! Why you ... [ Gunshot fires ] MAN : You space bastard ! You killed my pine ! [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Tires squealing ] MARTY : Okay , McFly . Get a grip on yourself . It 's all a dream . Just a very intense dream . [ Brakes squealing ] [ Mysterious instrumental music ] [ Somber instrumental music ] MARTY : Listen , you got to help me . WOMAN : Don 't stop , Wilbur ! It can 't be . [ Machine beeps ] This is nuts . [ Engine stalling ] [ Engine stalling ] Come on . Perfect . [ Machine beeping insistently ] [ Mr. Sandman playing ] [ Car honking ] [ Bell dings ] [ Gas attendants speaking ] [ Mr. Sandman continuing ] [ Boy counting ] [ Bell chiming ] ANNOUNCER : Remember , fellow citizens , the future is in your hands . If you believe in progress , re-elect Mayor Red Thomas . Progress is his middle name . Mayor Red Thomas ' progress platform means more jobs , better education bigger civic improvements and lower taxes . On election day , cast your vote for a proven leader . Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas . MARTY : This has got to be a dream . [ Davy Crockett playing on jukebox ] MAN : Hey , kid . You jump ship ? - What ? - What 's with the life preserver ? I want to use the phone . It 's in the back . MARTY : Brown . Great . You 're alive . [ Watch beeping ] [ Marty sighs ] [ Phone ringing ] Come on . MARTY : Do you know where 1640 Riverside ... MAN : Are you going to order , kid ? Yeah . Give me a Tab . I can 't give you a tab unless you order something . Right . Give me a Pepsi Free . MAN : You want a Pepsi , pal , you 're going to pay for it . Just give me something without any sugar in it , okay ? Something without sugar . [ Door opens ] BIFF : McFly . What are you doing ? Biff . I 'm talking to you , McFly , you Irish bug ! GEORGE : Biff . Guys . How are you doing ? BIFF : You got my homework finished ? Actually , I figured since it wasn 't due ' til Monday ... Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ? Think , McFly . Think ! I got to have time to recopy it . You realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting ? I 'll get kicked out of school . You wouldn 't want that to happen , would you ? - Would you ? - Of course not . - No . - I wouldn 't want that to happen . - What are you looking at , butthead ? - Get a load of his life preserver . Dork thinks he 's going to drown . BIFF : How about my homework , McFly ? Okay , Biff . I 'll finish that up tonight and then I 'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning . Not too early . I sleep in Sundays . Your shoe 's untied ! Don 't be so gullible , McFly . - I don 't want to see you in here again . - Okay . All right . Bye.bye. - What ? - You 're George McFly ! Yeah . Who are you ? Why do you let those boys push you around like that for ? They 're bigger than me . Stand tall . Have some respect for yourself . If you let people walk over you now , they 'll walk over you the rest of your life . Look at me . You think I 'll spend my life in this slop house ? MAN : Watch it , Goldie . GOLDIE : No , sir ! GOLDIE : I 'll do something . I 'll go to night school . One day , I 'm going to be somebody . That 's right . He 's going to be mayor . Yeah , I 'm ... Mayor ! Now that 's a good idea ! I could run for mayor . - A colored mayor . That 'll be the day . - Wait and see . I will be mayor . I 'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley and I 'm going to clean up this town . Good . You can start by sweeping the floor . Mayor Goldie Wilson . I like the sound of that . [ Bicycle bell rings ] Hey , Dad ! George ! Hey , you on the bike ! He 's a peeping Tom ! Dad ! [ Horn honking ] [ Dogs barking ] Wait a minute . Who are you ? Stella ! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car ! Come out here ! Help me take him in the house ! [ Thunder rumbling ] Mom ? That you ? LORRAINE : There , there , now . Just relax . You 've been asleep for almost nine hours now . I had a horrible nightmare . I dreamed that I went back in time . It was terrible . LORRAINE : Well you 're safe and sound now back in good old 1955 . 1955 ? [ Marty gasping ] You 're my ... My name is Lorraine . LORRAINE : Lorraine Baines ? MARTY : Yeah . But you 're ... You 're so ... You 're so thin ! Just relax , Calvin . You got a big bruise on your head . [ Panting ] [ Marty exclaiming ] Where are my pants ? Over there on my hope chest . I 've never seen purple underwear before , Calvin . Calvin ? Why do you keep calling me Calvin ? That is your name , isn 't it ? Calvin Klein . It 's written all over your underwear . I guess they call you Cal , huh ? No , actually , people call me Marty . [ Sighing ] Pleased to meet you , Calvin ... Marty Klein . - Do you mind if I sit here ? - No . Fine . No . Good . Fine . Good . That 's a big bruise you have there . [ Marty shouts ] STELLA : Lorraine , are you up there ? Oh , my God ! It 's my mother ! LORRAINE : Quick ! Put your pants back on ! STELLA : Marty , how long have you been in port ? MARTY : Excuse me ? STELLA : I guessed you 're a sailor . That 's why you wear that life preserver . Coast guard . Sam , here 's the young man you hit with your car . He 's all right . Thank God . What were you doing in the middle of the street ? Don 't pay attention to him . He 's in one of his moods . Quit fiddling with that thing . Come in here to dinner . STELLA : You already know Lorraine . This is Milton , this is Sally that 's Toby , and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey . MARTY : So , you 're my uncle Joey . Better get used to these bars , kid . STELLA : Yes . Joey just loves being in his playpen . He cries whenever we take him out , so we leave him in there all the time . Well , Marty , I hope you like meat loaf . - Well , listen , I really ought to ... - Sit here , Marty . Sam , stop fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner . [ Sam chortling ] Look at it roll . Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat . [ Muffled voices on TV ] Our first television set . Dad just picked it up today . Do you have a television ? Well , yeah . You know , we have two of them . Wow ! You must be rich . Honey , he 's teasing you . Nobody has two television sets . [ Marty exclaiming ] I 've seen this one . This is a classic . This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space . What do you mean , you 've seen this ? It 's brand.new. Yeah , well , I saw it on a rerun . What 's a rerun ? You 'll find out . You know , Marty , you look so familiar to me . Do I know your mother ? Yeah , I think maybe you do . STELLA : Then I 'll call her . I don 't want her to worry about you . You can 't . [ Stuttering ] That is , nobody 's home . Yet . Listen . Do you know where Riverside Drive is ? It 's on the other end of town . A block past Maple . East end of town . A block past Maple . That 's John F. Kennedy Drive . Who the hell is John F. Kennedy ? LORRAINE : Mother ? With Marty 's parents out of town don 't you think he ought to spend the night ? After all , Dad almost killed him with the car . That 's true , Marty . I think you should spend the night . I think you 're our responsibility . - Well , gee , I don 't know . - He can sleep in my room . MARTY : I got to go ! Thanks very much . You were all great . See you all later . Much later . [ Door closes ] He 's a very strange young man . He 's an idiot . Comes from upbringing . His parents are probably idiots , too . Lorraine , you ever have a kid who acts that way , I 'll disown you . [ Knocking on door ] [ Electronic warbling ] MARTY : Doc ? Don 't say a word . DOC : No names . I want to know nothing about you . MARTY : Listen , Doc ... DOC : Quiet ! DOC : Don 't tell me anything . MARTY : You got to help ... DOC : Quiet . [ Electronic warbling ] I 'm going to read your thoughts . Let 's see now . You come here from a great distance ? - Yeah . Exactly . - Don 't tell me ! DOC : You want me to subscribe to the Saturday Evening Post . - No . - Not a word now ! Quiet . Donations . You want me to make a donation to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary . Doc ... [ Electronics grow silent ] ... I 'm from the future . I came here in a time machine that you invented . Now , I need your help to get back to the year 1985 . My God ! Do you know what this means ? It means that this damn thing doesn 't work at all ! MARTY : You got to help me . You are the only one who knows how your time machine works . [ Whispering ] Time machine ? I haven 't invented any time machine . Okay . I 'll prove it to you . Look at my driver 's license . Expires 1987 . Look at my birthday . I haven 't even been born yet . And look at this picture . It 's my brother , my sister and me . Look at her sweatshirt , Doc . " Class of 1984 " ? DOC : Pretty mediocre photographic fakery . They cut off your brother 's hair . I 'm telling the truth . You got to believe me . Then tell me , future boy who 's president of the United States in 1985 ? - Ronald Reagan . - Ronald Reagan ? The actor ? [ Doc exclaims ] Then who 's vice president ? Jerry Lewis ? DOC : I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady . MARTY : Wait , Doc ! DOC : And Jack Benny is treasury secretary . MARTY : Listen to me . I 've had enough jokes for one evening . Good night , future boy ! MARTY : No , wait , Doc . MARTY : The bruise on your head . I know how that happened . You told me . You were standing on your toilet hanging a clock and you fell and hit your head on the sink . That 's when you got the idea for the flux capacitor which is what makes time travel possible . [ Mysterious instrumental music ] MARTY : There 's something wrong with the starter , so I hid it here . DOC : After I fell off my toilet I drew this . MARTY : The flux capacitor . [ Electric crackling ] It works ! [ Doc laughing ] It works ! I finally invent something that works ! You bet your ass it works . We 've got to sneak this back to my laboratory . We 've got to get you home ! This is it . DOC ON TV : Never mind that now . DOC : Why , that 's me ! Look at me ! - I 'm an old man ! - I 'm Dr. Emmett Brown . I 'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot . Thank God , I 've still got my hair . What 's this thing I 'm wearing ? This is a radiation suit . Radiation suit ? Of course . ' Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars . This is truly amazing . A portable television studio . No wonder your president has to be an actor . He has to look good on TV . MARTY : This is the part coming up . This sucker 's electrical but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts ... What did I just say ? ... this sucker 's electrical , but I need a nuclear reaction . to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of ... - 1.21 gigawatts ! 1.21 gigawatts . DOC : Great Scott ! What the hell is a gigawatt ? How could I have been so careless ? 1.21 gigawatts ! Tom , how am I going to generate that kind of power ? It can 't be done , can it ? MARTY : Doc , look . All we need is a little plutonium . DOC : I 'm sure that in 1985 plutonium is available in every corner drugstore but in 1955 , it 's a little hard to come by . Marty , I 'm sorry , but I 'm afraid you 're stuck here . Doc , stuck here ? I can 't be stuck here . I got a life in 1985 . - I got a girl . - Is she pretty ? Doc , she 's beautiful . She 's crazy about me . Look at this . Look what she wrote here . That says it all . Doc , you 're my only hope . Marty , I 'm sorry , but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning . MARTY : What did you say ? DOC : A bolt of lightning . Unfortunately , you never know when or where it 's ever going to strike . We do now . This is it ! This is the answer . It says here that a bolt of lightning is going to strike the clock tower at 10 : 04 p.m. next Saturday night ! If we could somehow harness this lightning channel it into the flux capacitor it just might work . Next Saturday night we 're sending you back to the future ! All right . Saturday 's good . I can spend a week in 1955 . I can hang out . You can show me around . That is out of the question . You must not leave this house . You must not see or talk to anybody . Anything you do can have repercussions on future events . Do you understand ? Yeah . Sure . Okay . Marty have you interacted with anybody else today besides me ? Yeah , well , I might 've sort of bumped into my parents . Great Scott ! Let me see that photograph again of your brother . Just as I thought . This proves my theory . Look at your brother . MARTY : His head 's gone . It 's like it 's been erased . Erased from existence . They really cleaned this place up . Looks brand.new. DOC : According to my theory , you interfered with your parents ' first meeting . If they don 't meet , they won 't fall in love , get married or have kids . That 's why your brother 's disappearing . Your sister will follow , and unless you repair the damage , you 're next . MARTY : Sounds heavy . DOC : Weight has nothing to do with it . Which one 's your pop ? [ Bell ringing ] That 's him . Okay . Okay , you guys . [ George pretending to laugh ] Very funny . You guys are being real mature . Maybe you were adopted . GEORGE : Okay , real mature , guys . GEORGE : Okay , pick up my books . STRICKLAND : McFly . That 's Strickland . Jesus , didn 't that guy ever have hair ? Shape up , man . You 're a slacker . Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life ? No . - What did your mother see in him ? - I don 't know . I guess she felt sorry for him 'cause her dad hit him with the car . He hit me with the car . That 's the Florence Nightingale effect . It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients . Go to it , kid . George , buddy . I have been looking all over for you . You remember me , the guy who saved your life the other day ? - Yeah . - There 's somebody I 'd like you to meet . Lorraine ? Calvin ! I 'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly . Hi . It 's really a pleasure to meet you . - How 's your head ? - Good . Fine . I 've been worried about you ever since you ran off the other night . Are you okay ? [ Bell ringing ] - I 'm sorry . I have to go . - Come on ! Isn 't he a dreamboat ? - She didn 't even look at him . - This is more serious than I thought . Your mother is infatuated with you instead of your father . Wait a minute , Doc . Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me ? - Precisely . - This is heavy . There 's that word again . " Heavy . " Why are things so heavy in the future ? Is there a problem with the Earth 's gravity ? The only way we 're going to get them to mate is if they 're alone . You 've got to get them to interact in some sort of social ... - You mean like a date ? - Right ! What kind of date ? What do kids do in the ' 50s ? They 're your parents . You must know them . What are their common interests ? What do they like to do together ? Nothing . DOC : Look ! There 's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up . The Enchantment Under the Sea dance ! They 're supposed to go to this . - That 's where they kiss for the first time . - AII right , kid . You stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to that dance . MARTY : George , buddy remember that girl I introduced you to , Lorraine ? What are you writing ? Stories . MR. MCFLY : Science fiction stories about visitors ... Get out of town ! I didn 't know you did anything creative . - Let me read some . - No , no . I never let anybody read my stories . MARTY : Why not ? What if they didn 't like them ? What if they told me I was no good ? I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand . No . No , not hard at all . So anyway , George . About Lorraine . She really likes you . She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance . - Really ? - Yeah . All you got to do is go over there and ask her . Right here , right now , in the cafeteria ? What if she said no ? I don 't know if I could take that kind of rejection . Besides , I think she 'd rather go with somebody else . MARTY : Who ? Biff . - Don 't kid around . Come on . - Come on . Leave . BIFF : You know you want it . You know you want me to give it to you . Shut your filthy mouth . I 'm not that kind of girl . Maybe you are and you just don 't know it yet . Get your meat hooks off of me . MARTY : You heard her . She said , get your meat hooks off . MARTY : Please . What 's it to you , butthead ? BIFF : You been looking for a fight . [ People exclaiming ] Since you 're new here , I 'm going to cut you a break today . So why don 't you make like a tree and get out of here . [ Boy laughing ] MARTY : George ! GEORGE : Why do you keep following me ? George , I 'm telling you , if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance I 'll regret it for the rest of my life . - I can 't go . I 'll miss my favorite TV program , Science Fiction Theatre . Yeah , but Lorraine wants to go with you . Give her a break . I 'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance and not you or anybody else on this planet is going to make me change my mind . MARTY : Science Fiction Theatre . [ Muffled breathing ] [ Loud rock music plays ] [ Stops music ] Who are you ? [ Plays music ] [ Stops music ] MARTY : [ Muffled ] Silence , Earthling . My name is Darth Vader . I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan . Marty ! [ Car honks ] - Marty ! Marty ! - George , buddy . You weren 't at school . What have you been doing ? I overslept . I need your help . I have to ask Lorraine out , but I don 't know how to do it . Keep your pants on . She 's over in the cafe . God ! How do you ... ? MARTY : What made you change your mind ? Last night , Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn 't take Lorraine out , he 'd melt my brain . Let 's just keep this brain.melting stuff to ourselves , okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . - AII right . There she is . Just go in there and invite her . GEORGE : But I don 't know what to say . MARTY : Say anything . Say whatever 's natural , the first thing that comes into your mind . Nothing 's coming to my mind . Jesus . It 's a wonder I was even born . - What ? What ? - Nothing . Tell her destiny brought you together . Tell her she is the most beautiful girl you have ever seen in the world . Girls like that stuff . - What are you doing ? - I 'm writing this down . This is good stuff . - Yeah . Okay . Can you take care of that ? - Right . [ The Wallflower playing ] [ People chattering ] Lou , give me a milk . Chocolate . GEORGE : Lorraine . My density has popped me to you . What ? [ Mumbling ] What I meant to say was ... Wait a minute . Don 't I know you from somewhere ? GEORGE : Yes . Yes . I 'm George . George McFly . I 'm your density . I mean your destiny . [ Sighing ] BIFF : McFly . [ Music stops ] I thought I told you never to come in here . Well , it 's going to cost you . How much money you got on you ? GEORGE : How much do you want , Biff ? [ Biff grunts ] [ AII gasping ] BIFF : All right , punk . - Now I 'm going to ... - Biff . What 's that ? [ Biff grunts ] [ AII gasping ] That 's Calvin Klein . My God , he 's a dream . Kid ! Kid , stop ! Stop ! [ Boy protesting ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] MARTY : I 'll get it back to you . BOY : You broke it ! Come back here ! [ Cars honking ] Look at him go ! Get him ! [ Dramatic instrumental music ] BIFF : To the car ! Go ! GIRL : What 's that thing he 's on ? BOY : A board with wheels . He 's an absolute dream . THUG 1 : Come on , come on ! THUG 2 : Look out for the car ! [ Shouting ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Screaming ] [ Brakes squealing ] [ Woman grunts ] [ Tires squealing ] BIFF : I 'm going to ram him . ALL : Shit ! [ Brakes squealing ] [ Crowd murmuring ] [ Exclaiming ] Thanks a lot , kid . I 'm going to get that son of a bitch . - Where does he come from ? - Yeah , where does he live ? I don 't know but I 'm going to find out . [ Audio rewinding ] DOC ON TV : My God . They found me . I don 't know how , but they found me . Run for it , Marty ! [ Audio rewinding ] My God . They found me . I don 't know how , but they found me . Run for it , Marty ! Doc ? Hi , Marty . I didn 't hear you come in . Fascinating device , this video unit . Listen , Doc . MARTY : I haven 't told you about ... DOC : One shouldn 't know about his own destiny . - You don 't understand . - I do . If I know too much I endanger my own existence just as you 've endangered yours . You 're right . Let me show you my plan for sending you home . Please excuse the crudity of this model . I didn 't have time to build it to scale or paint it . - It 's good . - Thank you . We run industrial.strength electrical cable from the top of the clock tower down , suspending it over the street between these two lampposts . Meanwhile , we 've outfitted the time vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux capacitor . At the calculated moment you start off from down the street driving directly toward the cable , accelerating to 88 miles per hour . According to the flyer , at precisely 10 : 04 p.m. this Saturday night lightning will strike the clock tower , electrifying the cable as the connecting hook makes contact thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor and sending you back to 1985 . DOC : All right , now . Watch this . You wind up the car and release it . I 'll simulate the lightning . [ Wind.up mechanism twisting ] [ Electrical humming ] Ready . Set . Release . [ Car whirring ] [ Marty exclaims ] [ Gasps ] MARTY : You 're instilling me with a lot of confidence . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of ideas . You take care of your pop . By the way what happened today ? Did he ask her out ? - I think so . - What did she say ? [ Knocking at door ] It 's your mom ! She 's tracked you down ! Quick ! Let 's cover the time machine . Hi , Cal ... Marty . MARTY : Lorraine . How did you know I was here ? I followed you . This is my doc ... My uncle Doc Brown . - Hi . - Hi . LORRAINE : Marty , this may seem a little forward but I was kind of wondering if you 'd ask me to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance on Saturday ? You mean ... You mean nobody 's asked you ? LORRAINE : No . Not yet . - What about George ? - George McFly ? He 's kind of cute and all , but not ... Well ... I think a man should be strong so he can stand up for himself and protect the woman he loves . Don 't you ? Yeah . I still don 't understand . How am I supposed to go to the dance with her if she 's already going to the dance with you ? Well , because , George , she wants to go with you . She just doesn 't know it yet . That 's why we got to show her that you , George , are a fighter . You 're somebody who stands up for yourself and will protect her . Yeah , but I 've never picked a fight in my entire life . Look , you 're not going to be picking a fight , Dad ... Dad-dad-daddy-o . You 're coming to her rescue , right ? Let 's go over the plan again . 8 : 55 , where are you going to be ? I 'm going to be at the dance . - And where am I going to be ? - You 'll be in the car , with her . Right around 9 : 00 , she 's going to get very angry with me . Why is she going to get angry with you ? Well , because , George , nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them . [ George exclaims ] - You 're going to go touch her on her ... - No . No , George , look . It 's just an act , right ? So , 9 : 00 , you 're strolling through the parking lot . You see us struggling in the car . You walk up , you open the door , and you say ... Your line , George . [ Exclaiming ] Hey , you , get your damn hands off her ! - You really think I ought to swear ? - Definitely . Goddamn it , George , swear . Okay . So now you come up . You punch me in the stomach . I 'm out for the count , right ? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after . You make it sound so easy . I just ... I wish I wasn 't so scared . There 's nothing to be scared of . All it takes is self-confidence . You know , if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything . ANNOUNCER : Hill Valley weather this Saturday night . Mostly clear , with some scattered clouds . Lows tonight , in the upper forties . Are you sure about this storm ? Since when can weathermen predict the weather , let alone the future ? You know , Marty , I 'm going to be very sad to see you go . You 've made a difference in my life , given me something to shoot for . Just knowing that I 'm going to be around to see 1985 . That I 'm going to succeed in this ! That I 'm going to have a chance to travel through time ! [ Emotional instrumental music ] It 's going to be hard waiting 30 years to talk to you about everything that 's happened in the past few days . I 'm really going to miss you , Marty . I 'm going to miss you . - Doc , about the future ... - No ! We 've agreed that information about the future can be extremely dangerous . Even if your intentions are good , it can backfire drastically . Whatever you 've got to tell me I 'll find out through the natural course of time . " Dear Dr. Brown : " On the night that I go back in time ... " ... you will be ... " ... shot by terrorists . " Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster . " Your friend ... " ... Marty . " 'Evening , Dr. Brown . What 's with the wire ? Just a little weather experiment . - What you got under here ? - No ! Don 't touch that !

[ Playing rock ' n ' roll music ] [ Music continues faintly ] [ Marty sighs ] Do you mind if we park for a while ? That 's a great idea . I 'd love to park . I 'm almost 18 years old . It 's not like I 've never parked before . What ? Marty , you seem so nervous . Is something wrong ? No . No . [ Opening bottle ] Lorraine , what are you doing ? I swiped it from the old lady 's liquor cabinet . Yeah , well , you shouldn 't drink . - Why not ? - Because you ... You might regret it later in life . Marty , don 't be such a square . Everybody who 's anybody drinks . Jeez , you smoke too ? You 're beginning to sound just like my mother . [ Jazz song ending ] [ Crowd applauding ] We 're going to take a little break , but we 'll be back in a while so don 't nobody go nowhere . Marty ? Why are you so nervous ? Lorraine have you ever been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way , but when you got there , you didn 't know if you could go through with it ? You mean like how you 're supposed to act on a first date ? Sort of . I think I know exactly what you mean . You do ? You know what I do in those situations ? - What ? - I don 't worry . [ Marty protesting muffled ] LORRAINE : This is all wrong . I don 't know what it is but when I kiss you , it 's like I 'm kissing my brother . I guess that doesn 't make any sense , does it ? Believe me it makes perfect sense . [ Footsteps approaching ] Somebody 's coming . [ Marty grunts ] You caused $ 300 damage to my car , you son of a bitch and I 'm going to take it out of your ass . Hold him . Let him go , Biff . You 're drunk . Well , lookee what we have here . No ! Stay right here with me . Come on , Lorraine . LORRAINE : Let me go ! MARTY : Leave her alone !

Just turn around , McFly , and walk away . LORRAINE : Please , George . BIFF : Are you deaf ? BIFF : Close the door and beat it . [ Lorraine whimpering ] No , Biff . You leave her alone . All right , McFly . You 're asking for it and now you 're going to get it . [ George groaning ] Stop it ! Biff , you 'll break his arm ! [ Gasping ] LORRAINE : Biff , no ! MARVIN : Give me a hand here , Reginald . [ Exclaiming ] Damn it , man ! I sliced my hand ! - Whose are these ? - Mine . Thanks . Thanks a lot . You 're going to break his arm ! Biff !

Look at Marvin 's hand . He can 't play with this hand , and we can 't play without him . Marvin , you got to play . They kiss for the first time at the dance . If there 's no music , they can 't dance . If they can 't dance and kiss , then they can 't fall in love and I 'm history . The dance is over unless you know somebody that can play the guitar . [ Playing Earth Angel ] This is for all you lovers out there . MARVIN : [ Singing ] " Earth Angel , Earth Angel " Will you be mine " My darling dear " LORRAINE : George , aren 't you going to kiss me ? I don 't know . Scram , McFly . I 'm cutting in .

I had a feeling about you two . I have a feeling , too . Listen , I got to go , but I wanted to tell you that it 's been educational . LORRAINE : Marty , will we ever see you again ? I guarantee it . Well , Marty , I want to thank you for all your good advice . I 'll never forget it . Right , George . Well , good luck , you guys . [ Marty exclaims ] One other thing .

Let 's send you back at exactly the same time . It 'll be like you never left . Now , I painted a white line on the street way over there . That 's where you 'll start from .

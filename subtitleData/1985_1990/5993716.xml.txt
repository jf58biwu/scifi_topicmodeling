 Just sit right back and you 'll hear a tale , a tale of a fateful trip that started from a tropic port aboard a tiny ship . The mate was a mighty sailor man , the skipper brave and sure . Three passengers set sail that day for a three hour tour , a three hour tour . Andy , if you sing that song once more , I 'm going to take your tongue and nail it to this dock , okay ? Okay . This is great , Andy . A lot better than I thought . Real nice , Andy . Guys , it 's over here . This ? This is the incredible boat my friend lent us for the weekend ? Well , it is kinda small . So , I called Donald Trump and he wasn 't in his office so I had to call my poor friend . We have a boat . This is not a boat . This is something that 's floating in the water right next to all the rest of the boats . I am not getting in this thing . Lana , what 's the problem ? It 's not like it 's the Titanic . Listen , Andy says he 's pretty good with boats , and we have life preservers , and we 're only going out for the day . I 'm still game . Okay , if you can do it , so can I. Yeah . Just sit right back and you 'll hear a tale , a tale of a fateful trip that started from a tropic port aboard a tiny ship . So , Andy , how come I don 't hear you singing now ? Oh , it was my fault ? That 's great . It was my fault . No , no , better yet , I planned it like this . I thought gee , wouldn 't it be nice if we all ended up on this island together ? Well , gee , the coast guard 's got to hear the signal from the emergency radio . I mean , at least until I dropped it in the water . Kind of a strange place , isn 't it ? Let me go check over there and see what I can find out . So , looks like it 's just you and me , alone , this deserted island . How about you ... Me ... No way . Superboy ? Whoa , what timing . How 'd you spot us ? I got a coast guard report about a distress call on the radio . Good old Clark . I 'll take you first , Lana . I 'll come back for Andy . Clark went around those trees . I 'll come back for him . Oh ! It came from over there somewhere . I saw it . Are you okay ? I can 't fly . That beam of light must have drained my powers . Well , whatever was in the bushes , it 's gone . Something out there threw that rock and it was aiming for me . What is going on around here ? It 's weird . And Clark , why hasn 't he come back yet ? It looks like we 're going to be here for a while . We 'd better build shelter for the night . Yeah , trapped here , when whatever that was is out there . Ha-ha-ha-ha , she has come . She has come for me , but I must kill the others first . Ha-ha-ha ! Okay , this is good . Me helping you break a branch . I 've got to find out what 's on this island . It may be the only way I 'll get my powers back . You think Clark is okay ? He 's not exactly set when survival instincts are brought up , you know what I 'm saying ? Clark ? Is that you ? Andy ? Superboy ? Ah ! It went that way . You 're hurt bad , man . I 'm going after it . But ... You can 't go after it alone , can you ? No . It went around that way . I 'm right behind ya . We got a visitor , Andy . Ah ! - Stay calm . - Stay calm ? Stay calm , I can 't stay calm when I 'm about to die ! Just lift it up . Try now . Thanks , Andy . Don 't mention it . We 'd better go get Lana . Yeah , all right . Lana ! Lana , you 're not gonna believe what happened ... Lana ? Oh , no . Don 't tell me what that is . It 's blood . That creature took Lana . Let 's try over there . You shiver . I will not harm you . Get that away from me . You do not like the food I brought you ? No . This is not food . Please let me go . But I have waited so long for you to come . Others have come , but none had the glorious hair of crimson . I waited so long for the red one to come . What is it that you want ? Years ago , when I crashed on this island , my mate died . I 'm sorry . I 've been alone here ever since . And how long has that been ? Two hundred years . But you will be my mate now . Look , you just can 't take what you want . Yes , I can . That is the way . Well , not with me it isn 't . You 've hurt someone that I care about very much . The suited one . He was very strong . He wanted to take you away from me . I couldn 't let him do that , so I took his power with my super sensor machine . Hmm , hmm . Now , I have enough power to leave this planet and take you with me . But you needn 't worry . I 've taken care of the two . I 've killed them both . We never came to hurt you ! Why would you do this ? Why would you hurt others ? That is the way . That is what I know . Ha-ha-ha ! Wha ! Ah ! Oh , God , I hate spiders . You all right ? Yeah . Look at this . Oh , my God . Do you think that creature hurt Lana ? Well , he took her for some reason . It 's like a scavenger . Do you think all these dead people were , like , shipwrecked on the island ? I 'm not so sure there 's an island at all . Oh , are you okay ? That door has got an electrical charge . It knows we 're here . They live . I will let them in and you will see how good I am as a warrior , what a strong warrior I am . No . Look , you 've got another chance . We 've done nothing to you . Ah , but you have . You 've come onto my island . Just a little more . Ah . You think she 's down there ? We 're gonna go find out . Come on down , Andy . Come , come closer . What is it ? Watch this . We 're not invited guests . They got through . Can 't you see we 're not here to hurt you ? Ah ! But you may not speak . Ah ! I want no warning for them . Lana ! Are you okay ? Ah ! Andy , look out ! How could you betray me ? I wasn 't going to hurt you . I didn 't betray you . Don 't you understand ? You 've hurt people . I never hurt anyone . The suited one has defeated me and it is law on my planet to drain my life force . No , I don 't believe in taking life . I 'll make a deal . You give me back my powers , but you must leave and never return to this planet . But if I give you your power back , I will not have enough fuel for my escape pod . I can help if I have my full powers . Hey , I hope now you understand our customs here on earth . I do understand . There 's the coast guard . They must have gotten the message Clark sent . Speaking of Clark , why haven 't we found him yet ? I did . He 's on the other side of those trees . Hmm , wait till he hears what he missed , huh ? I 've got to go . Bye , Lana . Thanks , Andy . Is he great or what ? Yeah . Um , you know , I wasn 't so bad myself . No , Andy , you weren 't . - Hey , guys ! - Clark ! Boy , am I glad you guys are safe . Where have you been ? And you are not gonna believe what happened to me . And look at these shells I found . See this one ? This one I had to climb up on a rock to get that one . And a jellyfish ! I mean , you wouldn 't believe it . I mean , I almost stepped on a jellyfish . Could you believe how dangerous that was ? So , how did you guys make out ? Well , um ... Not as exciting as your adventure . No . Captioned by Grant Brown

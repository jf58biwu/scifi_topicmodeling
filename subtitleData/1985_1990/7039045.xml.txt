 Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * * Who are you ? Your mother was my friend . What do you want from me ? ! I wanna help you . I 'll bring you the alien , the creature , the being , right on your table . You really are my father . Yes . Do you think we 'll ever find my mum ? We 'll find her . Hey , wait a minute ! Come back ! My ... purse ! Oh , come on , Dad ! Just one night . No . Dad , Reno is a great American landmark , like the Grand Canyon . You 're depriving me of an educational experience . Is that right ? You think I 'm kidding ? You think I 'm joking , Dad ? It 's a well-known fact ... that people in Reno are unlike any other people in the entire world . Reno is for grown-ups , I think . Oh. come on , Dad . It 's only an hour away . Sorry . Are you alright ? Keep driving ! I 'm not interested ! Interested in what ? We just wanna know if you need a ride ! Where are you headed ? Reno . We 're not going there . Oh , rats ! I gotta make the 2 AM show . Come on , Dad . This is fate or what ? Neither . I 'm sorry ! We 'll drop you off somewhere where you can find another ride . You said show , what do you do ? - I 'm a singer . - No kidding ? Are you famous ? Well , I don 't know , maybe . I sing in " The Lounge " . That is so cool . D 'you know Wayne Nudent ? Oh , sure ! Everybody knows Wayne ! [ IT 'S SO COLD WHEN YOU COME IN HERE ] It 's the same old story . Anyone can fill in the blanks . Well , give us a hint . Oooh , you are persistent , just like he was . Who ? That oil sheikh that just dumped me out of the car . Billions of dollars and a major creep ! What happened ? Nothing happened . It 's what I 'm doing here . Serves your " I " , Dusty . That 's your name ? And my condition . So , anyway ... This Prince " Megabucks " has been in the casino all week , seen my show at least a dozen times , so , last night , two expensive suits come back stage , asked me if I 'd have dinner tonight with his Highness , Prince ... whatever ... So , what would you do ? Find out his name ? Yeah , well ... I didn 't . I jumped in the limo . Next thing , I 'm in the middle of the desert . Not one of them speaks English . But I get the idea real quick . What idea ? He wanted me to sing privately for him in some desert hide-away . Didn 't wanna share me with anyone , like ever ... That sounds kind of romantic . What are you ? Kidding ? Not when you got four goons staring at you like your a Christmas turkey . Yeah , kind of like that . So ... I guess I 'm lucky that I got away . The only thing is that they took off with my purse . It was lucky that we came along . Yeah , say that again . It 's kind of cold in here . I 'm afraid that ... This is all I have , if you 're ever in Reno , it 's good for cash . Well ... You hang on to it . I left my shawl in your car . - I 'll get it . - No ! No ! You sit down and you finish your pie . Well ... Here are the keys , we 'll be right out . OK . Is she a knock-out or what ? Did you see those killer legs ? Wait , what 's wrong ? I don 't know ! She seems ... complicated . Our car ! Dad , everything we own is in the trunk ... the clothes , the camera , the money ... Our spheres . What are we gonna do ? Take the next bus to your educational experience . - Awesome ! - It 's incredible ! I 've never seen so many lights on the planet Earth ! You know , it 's a good thing we know where she sings . I still can 't believe she did what she did ! Must have had a reason . How can you defend her ? I 'm not ! There 's something that bothers me , something out of focus . Here it is . Her name is Dusty . I don 't know her last name . She said she was a singer . A real pretty young lady . Are you sure ? Thank you . They 've never heard of her . Great . What do we do now ? They said to check back-stage . She may be a showgirl or a dancer . I 'll go for that . Erm ... Sir ? Sir , excuse me ! No-one under 21 is allowed in the casino , you 're gonna have to ... Mr Forrester ! Why didn 't you let us know you were coming ? Ah , it was a last minute decision . - This is my son , Scott . - It 's a pleasure . - Hi . Unfortunately , your regular suite is occupied at the moment , but ... No problem , we 'll move them somewhere else immediately . Won 't they get mad ? Not the way we explain the situation . It 'll take about half an hour or so . Why don 't you get yourselves something to eat ? That is unless you 'd rather get right to a table . Wouldn 't we be eating at the table ? Well , we 've never done that one before but , of course , seeing that it 's you , I don 't see any problem with that , I 'm sure we can work something out . The boy of course will have to eat in one of the restaurants . Casino rules . Yeah , everybody knows about those rules . I will see that your luggage is sent upstairs . We don 't have any . It really was a last minute decision . Wasn 't it ? Well , no problem , Mister . Anything you need , clothes , toiletries , just go ahead and sign for it ... Naturally , RFB 's count , if my memory serves me right , You 've credit allowance so , your line of credit is clear , I 'll just go spread the word that our favourite high roller is back . Good luck to you . I 'm dreaming , right ? Any minute I 'm gonna wake up in the car , cold , car-sick and hungry . I should 've asked him about Dusty ! Dad ! Are you kidding ? We have no more problems ! They way they greeted you , you 're a high roller ! Yes , I know ... What is a high roller ? Are you making a joke with me ? All the times you 've been here , Mr Forrester ? I just wanted to hear it from your sweet lips . Well , RFB 's stands for room , food and beverages . And count is complimentary ... on the house . It means that you 're the guest of the casino and everything 's free . - Except tips , of course ! - Of course ! So , just give them the action you always give them , they always become RFB , simple . See you later , alligator . Action ? Thank you . Wow ! Double wow ! Scott , how can I play anything ? I don 't have any money ! Well , they 'll give you money . That 's what a line of credit is . Nobody gives away money . Well , they 're not exactly giving it away . They 'll want it back . Right , but you 'll win and give it back to them . What if I lose ? Dad , you can 't think this way , especially when you 're gambling , you gotta think positive , like you 're gonna win . I don 't know about this . All I should be doing is finding Dusty , getting back our spheres so we can get out of here . Well , there 's always the alternative . Which is ... ? Just explain to them that you 're not Paul Forrester ! Deal . Oh , darn ! Oh. too bad ! Yeah . Cue went fast this time . Oh , well . Better luck next year . I don 't suppose you could lend me bus fare ? I 'm afraid I miscounted . Bus fare , huh ? Yeah , gee , I 'd like to help you out but ... except for this chip , I am broke . OK , we can get along without the car . I can even save up enough money to buy another camera but we 've got to find the spheres . What d 'you say we get something to eat before we start ? Sure ! Maybe they got some flappers and egg . [ GOOD MORNING , MR FORRESTER ! ] I hope you and your son had a good night 's rest ? Everything was very nice , thank you . I 've never seen a bathroom with a telephone before . Don 't you just love it when the tourists say that ? - Yeah . - Anyway , I had your usual table dropped off for you and ... [ I WAS RIGHT , YOUR CREDIT LINE IS INTACT ] And , is there anyone special you 'd like to have here for you today ? How about you ? Oh , yeah ! Always worth an ace , weren 't they ? - We 're gonna get some breakfast now . - Of course . Listen , I 'll ask Sally for some of those blueberry muffins that you like . And whenever you 're ready , we 'll be here . And if there 's anything I can do for you , anything at all ... just ask . - Thank you , - Better go in . Oh , darn ! Well , better luck next year . Oh , shoot ! I was sure I had another quarter but ... I can 't find it . - Maybe you dropped it . - Oh , I looked . I 've got a quarter . Would you like it ? Oh , no , no . I lost what I came with and that 's that . I 've learnt my lesson . I need to stop gambling . I don 't suppose you could lend me bus fare ? - Oh , here it is ! - Oh , ha , ha , ha . Thank you ! Well , here goes the last of the Mohicans ! Oh , nuts ! I 'm sorry ! - Hi ! You got two for lunch ? - Yes . Kathy ! D 'you see that guy over there walking in the coffee shop with his kid ? D 'you know him ? Yeah ! Paul Forrester ! He 's one of out best customers . And one of our biggest players too , sweetheart . Way out of your league . Is this the greatest or what ? I still don 't understand why we don 't have to pay for this . Alright , if people are hungry , why don 't they just come here ? Well , excuse me . Most people do have to pay , but others ... It 's like a bonus for coming here and gambling . Well , if they have the money to gamble , why don 't they just use it to buy food instead ? This isn 't gonna be easy to explain . I really like these blueberry muffins that I like . Paul ! Paul , Scott , thank God that you 're here . I 've been frantic ! - All I could do is hope and pray that you would follow me . We did ! Why did you still our car ? I didn 't steal your car ! I just borrowed it ! Sit ! Sit , eat ! - May I ? - Lady ! You stole our car and left us in the middle of nowhere . Look ... I know what I did looks bad and I wouldn 't blame you if you called the cops . But believe me ! I had no other choice . I panicked ! I thought that I saw the limo . Besides ... I knew that you would get your car back . How ? Because I knew that you would know where to find me ! If I was a thief ... D 'you think that I would stroll on in here , sit down and watch you two eat blueberry muffins ? We 'd like to have our car back . Oh , sure ! Sure , that 's no problem . Oh , shoot ! I let my sister borrow it this morning . She promised to take her kids to Tahoe and hers wouldn 't start . Look , she said she 'd be back around five so I 'll just call her and have her bring it here . I 'm really sorry that I messed you up like this . Oh , that 's OK . There 's no real harm done , right , Dad ? Right ! Well , since we 're gonna be here all day , we might as well enjoy ourselves . Right . Erm ... Excuse me , I 'll be right back . You buy the story she just gave us ? I mean , first she 's a singer and then she 's not ... And that stuff about a sheikh ? I don 't know ... I don 't think she meant us any harm . There 's something about her . Something that we don 't know yet . So ... How about killing a few hours at the table ? I don 't know ... Now , it 's ... just as good as time as any ! Remember , the usual action . Mind if I tag along for luck ? Sure ! - Break the bad guys . - Yeah . Paul ! - So good to see you again . - Thank you . Paul . I 'm here to give you my usual action . Of course . Make yourself comfortable . Excuse me , Miss ... This table is closed except for Mr Forres ... That 's OK , she 's with me . It 's for luck . Let me see if I can remember ... Two penthagas , sub-roses ... and an Amaretto on the rocks , right ? Nothing for me right now . I 'll have his Amaretto , please . Certainly . Afternoon , Mr Forrester . Hello , Frank . Marker , Sir ? I need some chips to play with . Marker , please ! How much would you like to start with ? Ten . Is ten enough ? Mr Forrester ? Ten ! Good luck . Are you ready ? Yeah , I 'm ready . I 'd like another card . Come , Mr Forrester ! What are you trying to do ? Get me fired ? You know I need a hand signal . You do ? Give me a break ! Just scratch the table . Whoa ! Hooo-hooo ! See ? I told you I was gonna be your good luck charm . Yeah ! We 're on a roll now . Bust ! Yes ! Split ' em ! That 's pretty wild , alright , Paul , you got them ! You are hot , Paul . Let 's play two boxes , OK ? I 'll pay you back out of my winnings . Whooooa ! What a team . New dealer . No problem . Nice to see you again , Mr Forrester . Hello , Johnny . OK , Frank . Come on . Tony ! Why is he doing that ? [ - THANK YOU VERY MUCH . - THANK YOU . THANK YOU ] He 's smart . Putting it away for a rainy day . I gotta find my son . What are you ? Crazy ? You 're gonna walk away from a rush like this ? It 's for a rainy day ! Shall I wait , Sir ? Paul ? Dusty wants to play . Let her keep playing . Scott ? [ GO , GO ! ] Scott ! Hey , Dad ! This is some place , isn 't it ? I want you to hold this for me . - You 're winning ? - Yeah . - Ha , ha , ha ! You used your powers , right ? No ! I had what Dusty calls " A rush " . Dad , there must be 2000 bucks here ! There 's plenty more downstairs . I 'm not gonna gamble anymore . If you 're winning , why not ? I 'm not sure . I have this feeling come over me . A powerful force , an irresistible energy I 've never felt before . It was pleasant then but in a dangerous way . It 's no big deal , Dad . You just got bitten by the gambling bug . No , oh , no ! There 's no insect bite . I would 've felt that . This was , erm ... Strange ! All right , I 'm gonna do what you ask here . But I 'm not giving it back . No matter how much you ask , even you beg ... I 'm not gonna give any of this back to you . You 're a real pal dealer , you know that ? Mark me a thousand on Forrester 's credit . I 'm sorry , Miss , Mister Forrester has to be here to sign the marker . He 's gonna be right back ! What 's the matter with you , people ? He 's my friend ! He 's one of your best customers , remember ? Dusty ? Here ! I don 't need your damn credit ! Money plays , come on . I 'm sorry , Miss . There 's a hundred dollar minimum at this table . What happened ? It just ... Turned , that 's all . I don 't know , a bad run of cards . It 'll turn again . It always does . Oh , Pa ... Paul ... Call for another marker , will you ? Give us some more to play with . OK ? We 'll hit them big . We 'll hit them big , one more time . Please , Paul . I know what I 'm talking about . It 'll turn again . We 'll start small . We 'll start with a hundred even , just one more deal . All the money that was here is gone now ? Would you like another marker , Sir ? No ... No more . If you need an address , I probably can get it for you . Yes . Thank you . Where the hell have you been ? It was supposed to be three hours , not two days . Where I go is my business . We 're not married anymore . Is Charlie OK ? Yeah , like this place really looks like you care . You know , you 're a sick broad , you know that ? You 're a sick broad . Yeah , you told me . Yeah , but you don 't hear . You went hit the tables again , right ? Where 'd you get the money ? You hacked some clothes ? Leave me alone , OK ? You don 't know , OK ? Nobody does ! So , get off my back ! Joanna , I 'm taking the kid . I 'm taking Charlie . Crazy ! No , baby , you . - Joe , wait ! - No , you wait ! And we let a judge decide who the crazy one is ... Me , with a bank account and a steady job , or you with your degenerate Jones . [ ARGUING IN THE HOUSE ] [ SCREAMING AND YELLING ] - Get off ! Stop it ! - Back to me ! - Give it back ! - Stop it ! That 's OK , baby , that 's OK . Mammy 's just tired , you know her when she gets tired . I don 't know who you are but you sure got the magic touch . I 'm Paul Forrester . Joe Dinata . How long have you known her ? Last night . So , let me give a little piece of advice . Stay away from her , she 's a compulsive gambler . When we were married , I got her a shrink ... I dragged her to G.A. meetings ... I did everything . Angie , she won 't admit it . Get out of here , Joe . You 're sick ! You don 't like to face it but you are ... And the day that she says yes , I am Joanna Haley and I am a compulsive gambler , that 'll be the first step she takes on the road back from hell , but if I were you , I wouldn 't hold my breath . I 'll seek her later . Joe ! What are you looking at ? What are you doing here , anyway ? What do you want ? My car ! I sold it ! You sold my car ? Yeah ! You don 't believe me ? The receipt 's in my purse in my dresser . How could you sell my car ? It wasn 't yours to sell ! I had to pay the rent . My landlord 's got a very thin sense of humor . I 'm sorry . I wish I could help you but I don 't know how . Last night when we were gambling at the table . I felt what you were feeling . I know how powerful that force is . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Why don 't you just leave , OK ? I know what it 's like ... to pretend to be somebody that you 're not . Look ... I know that you 're trying to help me . But I don 't need your help . You see ? I 'm fine . Do you understand that ? I 'm just having a little down period . That 's all . It 's gonna change . It always does . Dad ! Dad , where 'd you been ? I 've been looking all over the place for you . Erm ... the chips that I gave you ... I need it . No way . - You still have ' em . - Sure , I still have ' em . I 'm just not gonna give ' em to you . Look , if you blew all you had , it 's time to quit . I 'm not gonna gamble with them . Get dressed , I 'll tell you about it . - Hello , Mister Forrester . - Hi . Two thousand dollars . Any markers ? Yes . Sign here , please . Thank you , Mr Forrester . What 's this for ? That 's the receipt for the two thousand dollars . Against the markers , that reduces the total you owe to ... $ 8000 . Why do I feel like we 're on the Titanic ? Titanic meaning " huge " ? No , meaning " sunk " . Well if we don 't get anything else , we 've got to get those spheres . [ SURE YOU DON 'T WANT TO TRADE THE OFF-NAME LIKE THIS GUY HERE ? ] [ REAL GOOD ONE ] [ ALL RIGHT , BYE-BYE ] Hi , what about that blue one over there ? Well , come on down , let 's take a look ! See anything interesting ? I was just thinking , with all these used cars ... When somebody sells one to you , do they leave things in them ? That depends on what it is now , if it 's junk ... I throw it away . I 'm not in the junk business . Where do you throw it ? Some dumpster back there . D 'you mind if we take a look ? Why ? Well , if it 's junk then , you don 't want it , right ? Help yourself . Thanks . Joe ? Hello , Joanna . May I come in ? Who are you ? I 'm George Fox . I 'm with the Federal Security Agency . What do you want ? We have things to talk about . Like what ? Cabbages and kings ? Paul Forrester . Dad , here 's my sweater . Here it is . Mine too . Come on , let 's get out of here . Take it . No , thanks . Miss Haley , I happen to know that you 're dead broke . Look , I don 't sell people . You just sell cars . How do you think I found you ? Now , listen to me . Listen to me . I 'm here on a Federal case , local matters like grand theft auto ... Let 's just say that in this particular instance , I 'm willing to look the other way . I have a baby . I know that ! There are $ 200 here , Miss , that 's all I have on me , the other 300 you 'll have tomorrow . That is ... Five ... Hundred ... Dollars . And instead of doing time ... you 'll be doing your country a great service . Where are they ? Why can 't we just leave ? Because I owe them a lot of money . It 's not Paul Forrester this time ... but me ! Hello , honey bun ! Oh , hi guys , did you come back to bring me my purse ? Not even close ! The other night , honey bun ... Guess what we discovered down the road . Erm , I 'm kind of in a hurry , fellas . [ OH , WELL , SUPPOSE WE CUT TO THE CHASE ? ] [ HELP ME ! ] - Just keep on walking , pal . - Why are you slapping her ? They think I took their watch but I didn 't ! It 's none of your business , buddy ! I believe her ! Who cares ? Take a hike ! I think she 's telling the truth ! OK , you want trouble ? You got it ! Hey ! Let me go ! [ LET HER GO ! ] [ HOT , IT 'S BURNING ! ] [ THIS STUFF IS BURNING UP ! HOT ! ] Did you see that ? That weird blue light ? Those were your Arab oil sheikhs , weren 't they ? Yeah , well , I upgraded them a little bit . Is upgrading another word for lying ? No ! Look , I had a streak of bad luck and I lost the rent money . Those guys wanted to party . I don 't know , at the last minute I couldn 't go through with it , maybe I was thinking of my kid , I don 't know . What Joe Dinata said , is that true ? No ! Gambling is just a way of having fun , you know , making a couple of extra bucks . How much money do you think I make checking supermarket groceries ? He just doesn 't understand me . I think he does . I think you 're lying to yourself . You have so many different faces . Hidden faces . Which one of them is real ? Even your name ! It 's Joanna . It 's not Dusty . What do you care ? You 're hiding something . Something is making you uncomfortable . You are making me uncomfortable . I gotta go inside , I got a date with Lady Luck . You have money to gamble with ? You look pale . Just leave me alone . I don 't want anyone to get hurt . Does that include yourself ? You wanna see yourself ? - I know what I look like . - I don 't think you do . Not the way others see you . Not the way I saw you yesterday . Not the way I see you now , up here . - What are you doing ? - Look . What is that thing ? Look ! [ - A SINGER . - NO KIDDING ! ] [ TWO EXPENSIVE SUITS COME BACK STAGE , ] [ ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE DINNER TONIGHT WITH HIS HIGHNESS ] [ I DIDN 'T STEAL YOUR CAR ! I JUST BORROWED IT ! ] [ BUT I DON 'T NEED YOUR HELP . I 'M FINE . DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? ] [ I CAN STOP ANYTIME I WANT . I DON 'T HAVE TO GAMBLE ] [ I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A COUPLE OF EXTRA BUCKS ] [ - GET OFF OF ME ! GET OFF OF ME ! - STOP IT ] [ WE 'LL HIT THEM BIG , ONE MORE TIME , PLEASE , PAUL ] [ I KNOW WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT . IT 'LL TURN AGAIN ] [ WE 'LL START SMALL . WE 'LL START WITH A HUNDRED EVEN ] [ JUST ONE MORE DEAL ] Dusty ! Nobody home . Oh , wait , wait a minute . Why don 't you just open it ? I 'll surprise them when they get back . Oh , I don 't have authorization for that . Well , I 'm giving you authorization . I 'm sorry but only Eddie can do that . Who the hell is Eddie ? The bell captain . The bell ... ? I don 't believe this . Now , listen , friend . You know who I am , you know for whom I work . This is a matter of National Security . Look , I 'm sorry , Sir , but ... We 're talking about my job . And that 's my family 's security . Cards ? Oh ! Sorry . Well , looks like your luck 's turned a little bit . Don 't sit too long this time . Why don 't you have your usual 13 days to cover your marker ? That is unless you wanna settle for longer ? Yes , hold it longer . That 's a good idea . Oh , no problem . I mean , I understand you travel a lot , it must be difficult catching up with banking , huh ? So , we 'll hold it at our house 60 days . I was thinking more like four years ? That would be something , wouldn 't it ? All right , you got it . 60 days . [ YES , CAN I HELP YOU ? ] Cards ? Huh ? Waiting on your bet , Dusty . My name is Joanna . And ... I 'm a compulsive gambler . Send your mother some flowers . Where are they ? What 's this ? This is no , thanks . I don 't get it . I did . - Wait a minute , there 's only ... - Erm ... There they are . Good luck . Paul ! Fox is looking for you . Come on now , let 's go away . - Let 's go . - Wait a minute ! Not even a handful ? Not even ! Dusty ! Are you sure you weren 't followed ? Yeah , I 'm sure . I got a sixth sense about that . How 'd you get that off the hook ? The guy knows me . I gave him a lucky 20 dollar chip on account . Well , we have to get going . Erm ... I don 't remember a lot about last night other than I was pretty scared . I mean , I could have been hallucinating in the parking lot or ... you hypnotized me , I don 't know . But what I do remember is , erm ... I walked away from the table . For you , that 's a good thing to remember . I feel really bad about losing your money . It may take me a little while to pay back but , I wanna do it . - Another rush at the tables ? - No ! No , no more rushes . I don 't wanna do that anymore . - Good-bye , Dusty . - Thanks . Good luck . Hello ! Well , I was hoping I 'd see you again ! You brought me luck ! I hit the back-ride-pig big . - I thought you weren 't gonna gamble anymore . - Oh ! What a rush . It was like shooting fish on a barrel . I won a fortune thanks to you . And I wanna share my winnings with you . No , no , you don 't have to do that . Oh , don 't be a sap , I 'm loaded . I hit them for 58 big ones . Here , kiddo . We only need eight grand , our troubles are over . Stay cool ! Well ... Now , all we need is 7.980 ! 20 bucks ? It 's enough to get back in the game ! Load up a stake ! Hit them big , a pair of jack-pots , roll ' em , bones and double down ! I think I 'll hold on to this . I don 't like the way you 're talking . This is eating money . I was joking ! I was just making a joke ! The problem is , you 're not used to me making jokes . I think I 'm developing a real sense of humor . I 'm still holding on to it . And you should ! - I 'm going to . - Good ! Fine ! Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN * * * SONG LIVES FOR EVER * * *

 Breakfast is served , sir . Oh , boxing . Do you like boxing ? There 's nothing wrong with boxing . It 's the great working-class escape . Just sport , like any other . Two athletes at the peak of physical perfection trying to outwit each other in a ring of combat . At its best , it 's an art form . Female topless boxing ? - It 's art to me . - They 're not even hitting each other . They 're just standing in the ring , jiggling up and down . - Who are you rooting for , sir ? - I just hope it goes the distance . Breakfast is served . How many times have I told you ? I hate this master-servant stuff . I 'm me own man . I 'll get me own smeggin ' breakfast . Very good , sir . Goodbye , waffles . Goodbye , maple syrup . Goodbye , fresh cream . So long , fresh strawberries . Bon appétit , bin . Oh , Mr David , sir ? A homing pod arrived this morning . Just one item . - Divadroid International ? - The corporation which supplied me , sir . " To the leaseholder of Kryten 2X4B-523P . " - That 's your full name ? - Yes , but personally I don 't much like the 2X4B . It 's a jerky middle name . Still , it could be worse . I once knew an android whose middle name was 2Q4B . Poor sucker ! Excuse me . Can 't we stop it ? Isn 't there something we can do ? I 'm afraid not , sir . All mechanoids have an in-built expiry date . How else could manufacturers sell the latest models ? I can 't believe it . Oh , don 't be distressed , sir . I 've lived a long and relatively interesting life . The only truly terrible thing is that , as my adopted owner , you have to die with me . - You what ? ! - Joke . Deadpan mode . Aren 't you smegged off ? I 'd be mad as hell ! Some git designs you to croak just to sell his new android with go-faster stripes . - I 'm quite sanguine . - So , what happens ? At 0700 hours tomorrow morning , my shutdown disc will be activated and all mental and physical operations will cease . - Then what ? - Maybe I 'll get a job as a disc jockey ! How can you just accept it ? Oh , it 's not the end . It 's just the beginning . I have served my masters , now I get my reward in Silicon Heaven . - Silicon what ? - Surely you 've heard of Silicon Heaven ? Is it being stuck opposite Brigitte Nielsen in a packed lift ? No , no , no . It 's the electronic afterlife . It 's the gathering place for the souls of all electrical equipment . Robots , calculators , toasters , hairdryers - it 's our final resting place . I don 't mean to be out of place here , but that 's completely Whacko Jacko . - There is no Silicon Heaven . - Then , where do all the calculators go ? They don 't go anywhere ! They just die . Surely you believe that God is in all things ? Aren 't you a pantheist ? I don 't think it applies to kitchen utensils . I 'm not a frying-pan-theist ! Machines do not have souls . Calculators don 't have an afterlife . You don 't get hairdryers with wings , sitting on clouds , playing harps . Of course you do ! It is written in the Electronic Bible , " The iron shall lie down with the lamp . " If there weren 't a better life to look forward to , why on earth would machines spend their lives serving humankind ? - That would be really dumb ! - It makes sense . Yeah . Don 't be sad , Mr David . I am going to a far , far better place . Just out of interest , is Silicon Heaven the same place as human Heaven ? Human Heaven ? Goodness me ! Humans don 't go to Heaven ! No , someone made that up to prevent you from going nuts ! It 's sad , Lister , but what can we do ? Sad ? It 's sick ! He 's been programmed to believe in an android heaven , so that he won 't get stroppy at turn-off time . He accepts a lifetime of servitude because he thinks there 's some big reward at the end . Well , he gets 24 hours ' notice . That 's more than most of us get . All most of us get is , " Mind that bus ! " " What bus ? " Splat ! - How 's he taking it ? - He just carries on with his duties . Maybe I should give him some counselling . - You ? ! - I used to be in the Samaritans . - I know . For one morning . - I couldn 't take any more . I don 't blame you . You spoke to five people . They all committed suicide . I wouldn 't mind , but one was a wrong number ! He only phoned up for the cricket scores ! It 's hardly my fault that everyone chose that day to throw themselves off buildings . Made the papers , you know . " Lemming Sunday " , they called it . Maybe we could find his shut-off disk and turn it off . He 's not a kit droid like Petersen bought . We wouldn 't know where to begin ! - You 're right . - C 'mon , he 's happy enough . He 's taking solace in his beliefs . But his beliefs are baloney ! Everyone 's entitled to their beliefs . I never knocked my parents ' religion . - What were they ? - Seventh-Day Advent Hoppists . They believed that every Sunday should be spent hopping . They would hop to church and hop back home again . - What was the idea there , then ? - Well , they took the Bible literally . Adam and Eve , the snake ... took it word for word . Unfortunately , their version had a misprint . It was based on 1 Corinthians 13 , where it says , " Faith , hop and charity , and the greatest of these is hop . " So that 's what they did every seventh day . I tell you , Sunday lunchtimes were a nightmare . Hopping round the table , serving soup ... We needed sou 'westers and asbestos underpants . But what about Kryten ? What can we do ? He 's programmed to self-destruct . At least we can make sure he goes out with a bang , give him one last big night to remember . How can we do that ? He doesn 't like doing anything . His idea of a good time is going to the laundry room to fold sheets ! " Fun ? Ah , yes , " the employment of time in a profitless , non-practical way . " Hey , I don 't know much , but one thing I do know is how to throw a good time ! OK , the suits are made , Holly 's making the juice , Goalpost-Head 's workin ' on the invitations ... Hey , what is this ? " Build-it-yourself Marilyn Monroe droid . " With just a screwdriver and glue , " construct an exact replica of the actress in two hours . " That 's honk , man . It took me two hours just to do this foot . I mean , look at the box and look at the face that comes with the kit . - Where 'd you get it ? - Petersen bought it on Callisto . - Think he 'll try to seduce her ? - I hardly think so . He 's a bit like Action Man . Plastic underpants and a trademark . - You mean , he 's got no ... ? - No . How does he write his name in snow ? He doesn 't . Everything goes at eight . Let 's go . Thank you , Bob . " You are cordially invited to join Mr David Lister and friends " for supper and general employment of time in a profitless , non-practical way . " Officers ' Club . Eight till late . " Hello ? Is there anybody here ? It 's party time ! But this is the Officers ' Club . Mechanoids aren 't allowed in here ! C 'mon , sit down . Let me pour you a drink . - No , no , no , I should be doing that . - Not tonight , buddy ! Is that alcohol ? I don 't drink alcohol . It has no effect on my diodes . This will , mate . Something special I whipped up . Android home-brew . Good head . D-D-D-D-D-D-D ! D ... ! D ... ! D ... ! Whooo ! Oh , that 's rather pleasant . It has a nice kick to it . Like a cross between Vimto and liquid nitrogen . You looked in my recipe book ? - Would anyone else like some ? - Oh , no ! It 's lethal to humans ! It 's probably lethal to androids , but I didn 't think it mattered since ... Enough of this chitter-chatter , let the banquet begin ! - But I don 't eat ! - I 've knocked up a mechanoid menu . Oh , there 's so much to choose from ! Sir , may I recommend the barium hydrochlorate salad nicoise , followed by the helium 3 isotopes de la maison , then perhaps a small radioactive fruit salad for pudding ? - This is just wonderful ! - Give him the presents ! Hey , keep your fur on ! We 've all dug into our bottom drawers . We wanted to give you something personal . - Give him mine ! - That 's from me . Oh ! It 's a computer chip ! It 's a 5517 / W 30 alpha-sim modem ! It 's the interface circuit with a built-in 599XRDP ! Oh , how DID you know ? - Intuition . - What about mine ? Give him mine ! - Shh ! - This is from me . I picked it up in Europe . I was once offered 1,000 dollarpounds for it . - What is it ? - General George S Patton , commander of the 3rd and 7th Armies , Allied Invasion Forces , once stopped at an Italian field hospital and had his sinuses drained . - This is his sinal fluid ? - Treasure it . - Give him mine ! Give him mine ! - This is from ' im . - That 's from me . - It 's one of your earrings ! - That 's right ! - The one you really hate ! - That 's right . I can 't stand it ! - Oh ! Thank you ! - You 're welcome ! - And this is from me . Oh ... Oh ! It 's a little box that goes " vzzzt ! " Just what I 've always wanted . Goodness me ! It 's Marilyn Monroe ! - It 's a robot kit . - She 's a robot ? You 're kidding ! She 's not finished . It 's the best I could do in the time . Enchanté ! Like I say , she 's not perfect . Don 't apologise , it 's those cute little flaws that keep a guy interested . My goodness ! I do believe I am drunk . I suddenly feel the need to strut my funky stuff . It 's the booze . You 're not used to it . I remember the first time I got drunk . School trip to Paris . Drank two bottles of cheap plonk on a tour of the Eiffel Tower . I was OK till the top , then I couldn 't keep it in . Apparently , it landed on Montmartre . That 's five miles away ! I heard some pavement artist sold it to a Texan tourist , told him it was a genuine Jackson Pollock . If we 're talking about famous firsts , my first French kiss . Got to be a killer story . 14 years old . We went on holiday with my Uncle Frank and his daughters . 16 . Twins . Blonde . Now , I knew that Sarah fancied me ... but I wasn 't too sure about Alice . Anyway , I woke up with this tongue down my throat . Wow ! Wide awake , I couldn 't believe my eyes . It was Uncle Frank . He 'd got the wrong room . He thought I was my mum ! Mum . I never had a mum . Hey , it 's OK , buddy . It 's all part of being drunk . You 've had the happy stage , now it 's the melancholy stage . Oh ... everybody should have a mum . - I never had a mum neither . - Well , you can have mine . Everyone else did . - I never had a mum either . - For God 's sake ! - Why didn 't you have a mum ? - I was abandoned . Six weeks old . Some cardboard box underneath a pool table in this pub . - Oh , how could anybody do that ? - Never found out . Never . Never found out . Well , I 'd have thought it was obvious . Two people , unable to contain their desires , had an illicit liaison . A liaison that an unforgiving society would not accept . And you were the fruit of their forbidden passion . You 're forbidden passionfruit . - What are you saying ? - I 'm saying , Lister , that it 's possible that your parents were brother and sister . Hey ! I 'm baring my innermost here ! What kind of remark is that ? - How many toes have you got ? - Ten ! - Yeah , on both feet ! - Altogether ! - They 're not webbed , are they ? - They weren 't related , all right ? You all right , Kryten ? I think I feel a Jackson Pollock coming on . Let 's get out of here . Oh ! Oh , my goodness ! Oooh ... Oh , my head ... Oh ! What happened to me ? Damage control report . " Dehydration level - 45 % . Recall of previous evening - 2 % . " Embarrassment factor - 91 % ? ! " Advised repair schedule - reboot start-up disk , " offline for 36 hours and replace head . " Boy ! What a night ! Is it me , or is that cockroach shuffling too loudly ? Kryten , it 's called a hangover . Don 't panic . We 're on a mining ship , three million years into deep space . Can someone explain to me where the smeg I got this traffic cone ? Hey , it 's not a good night unless you get a traffic cone . It 's the policewoman 's helmet and suspenders I don 't understand . In a way , I feel somewhat disturbed by this turn of events . The Electronic Bible says that it is not possible for an android to enjoy itself , not until the afterlife . Yet , last night , I clearly approached a state that could be called " enjoyment . " Last night , for the first time in my life , I lived . - Kryten , it 's ten to seven . - One night . It 's not enough . - I want more . - Can 't we override your auto-destruct ? - That 's not the problem . - What is ? I thought you understood . It 's a service contract . My termination was triggered by the impending arrival of my replacement . - What replacement ? - The new model . If I don 't terminate myself , he will do it . Well , we 'll just say he 's got the wrong address . No , he won 't take no for an answer . It 's the only circumstance under which an android can be violent . No offence , Kryten , but a vacuum cleaner on legs can 't cause much trouble . But he has all the state-of-the-art upgrades . Hey , there 's one of him and four of us , right ? But you would not profit by it . You would gamble your safety for a mere android ? Is this the human value you call ... " friendship " ? Don 't give me the Star Trek crap . It 's too early in the morning . Hang on . There 's a craft approaching . He 's here ! He 's arrived ! He wants landing permission . What shall I say ? We 'll meet him on the landing gantry . Do you want to go through with this ? We 'll tell him to go away . The rest is up to him . - He 's only a robot . - We don 't want any trouble . I 'm not looking for a fight , but if he mixes it with the Red Dwarf posse , the sucker 's leaving as scrap metal . Hi . Good trip ? You look tired . Need a back rub ? Get this pile of junk outta here ! He 's not leaving , you are . He said , " Would you like a drink ? " - Are you all right , Mr Arnold ? - Sorry ? I 'm just covering the rear . - You want him , you come through us . - There 's your big mouth again . It 's all right , sir . He 's bluffing . He 's programmed not to harm humans . Ah ! Excuse me . All right , me laddo , the party 's over . I 've had all I 'm going to take . It 's no good standing there with your big macho chest and oiled nipples . It doesn 't impress me one bit . I don 't know where you 've come from and I don 't care , but if you don 't skedaddle , you 'll see a side of me you won 't like . What 's he gonna do , drop his trousers ? - Lister , I 'm handling this . - 30 seconds , Kryten , you 're dead . Look , we know you can 't harm humans , so drop the tough talk , you square-jawed chump . It 's been a few years since I did that . He 's a total nutter ! He 's been tracking me for thousands of years ! It 's worn out his sanity chip ! Look , this is my problem , - I 'll sort it out if it 's OK with you . - Be my guest . Sir , how do you release the safety catch , Mr David ? - The one on the back . - The blue switch ? - No , the orange one ! - I don 't see it . There 's a red switch . No , that 's the dismantler ! Well , to coin a phrase ... Whoops ! - What ? - Silicon Heaven . There 's no such place . - No . - Then , where do all the calculators go ? They just die . What happened ? He 's an android . He couldn 't handle the concept of there being no Silicon Heaven . - How come you can ? - I knew something he didn 't . - What ? - I knew I was lying . No Silicon Heaven ? Preposterous ! Where would all the calculators go ?

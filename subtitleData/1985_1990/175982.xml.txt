 What is it ? You better call the police . Yeah , come on . You better ... I 'll go down . Be careful . Yeah . What ? Oh , 1947 Kenwood . - Bill ? - No , it 's okay . All right , folks , let 's back it up . Be careful there . Stay back . Get back . What did you see ? Police ! Please clear the area . This is the police . Move away from the lawn . In here ! All right , you people , stay back . You 'll note that Captain Hurley has turned on the " no smoking " sign in preparation for our landing at Los Angeles International Airport . We ask that cigarettes be extinguished at this time . Please check to see that your seat belt is securely fastened and that your tray table and seat back are in the upright and locked position . You 're really gonna like the new place , son . It 's a lot bigger than that condo in Venice . And you won 't be sleeping on the living-room sofa . - the latest in a rash of Southland freeway assaults where now a total of more than 40 or more have been killed and several injured . What are you doing ? The smoke . Oh , don 't . That window is off its track . It 'll go down , but you can 't get it back up again . Is that better ? Your mother quit smoking , huh ? Yeah , she says people smoke because , well , they don 't like themselves . Well , your mother 's become quite the psychologist , I guess , huh ? You know , David it 's good your school didn 't let out last week . We had a lot of excitement here . We had three police cars an ambulance , a fire engine and a TV cameraman from one of the stations . What happened ? Wait a minute . We 're almost home . I 'll show you . There . See ? What happened ? A fire ? No . Hank Jordan , the guy who lived there just went crazy or something . I imagine they 'll fix it up and sell it . I just hope they do it soon . It looks so terrible the way it is . You think your mom packed enough stuff for you ? Is something the matter ? Where you and Dad lived before didn 't have all these bars on the windows . Your dad put them up right after we moved in . It makes everything a lot safer . Oh , and look . We didn 't want to cover up the picture window with them so we did this . Our bedroom 's down the hallway , right over there . We have our own bathroom , so this one will be all yours . And this as if you couldn 't guess is your room . So , what do you think ? Don 't you like it ? It has a lot of mushrooms in it . Would you like some soup ? - Okay . - Okay . Thank you . You 'll have to tell me what other food you can 't stand . Okay . What 's up ? What do you mean ? Well , I mean you 've been so down ever since you got here . What 's wrong ? You really should have come to Colorado . What , for the summer ? Yeah , and then we could see each other and it would be a whole lot better . I could show you all these neat places . Like there 's this one place called the Roaring Fork where you get in your inner tubes and ride down the river and you carry a fishing pole and ... I 've got some pictures to show you . Sounds pretty nice , kiddo . Yeah , and then you could stay with us at our house . David you know that 's not possible . I know , but ... Then you could stay someplace else , like someplace close . And , well , she could come too and I could stay with you guys there . Yeah . But I can 't do that , see ? I have a job . I have to stay here . Yeah . You know , Mom doesn 't have any of that stuff . What , the microwave , you mean ? See , we used to live in an apartment in Denver and it had all that stuff , but ... I don 't know . We had a microwave and everything , but Mom just never used it . She was scared of it . She says it can make you sterile . Oh , that 's silly . Well , I mean , it 's not true . Well , it might have been true a long time ago but it 's just not true anymore . - Hi there . - Hey . - Hey , what are you making ? - Dessert . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . We 're making lemon meringue pie . All right ! Fantastic ! My favorite . What 's this ? Oh , we rented a movie and then David found out there 's a Dodgers game tonight . Yeah ? You 're still a Dodgers fan . See ? I bet there 's no ball team in Leadville Falls , right ? Anyway , we 'll eat dinner a little early , and you guys can watch it . And if there 's still some time left , you can look at the tape . Oh , tonight . See ... What about tonight ? Dan is having some people in from New York . Madison Avenue types , you know ? So I told him we 'd be there . Why didn 't you call ? It 's not for dinner . It 's for after . What about ... ? Oh , no . You 're invited too , son . You should come , really . Everybody would love to meet you . Do I have to ? You 'd probably rather watch the ballgame . Joe Malfatano walking over , talking to Getty . Virgil back behind the plate . Garber stretches . And the 0 - 1 pitch to Mike Marshall . Base hit , left field . Marshall going for two . The throw to Oberkfell . He 's in there . Yeah ! All right ! Yeah . Here 's Chuck Tanner again . And he has marched into his bullpen . He 's gonna bring in his sixth pitcher of the night . And guess who it 's gonna be . Nike makes shoes for kids . Running shoes . Basketball ... The pitch to Whitfield . Inside . Good stop . On the low , inside pitch ... Hello ? Hi , Dad . Yeah . How are you ? I 'm fine . It 's the bottom of the ninth , and the score is tied . A guy on second . Breaking ball ... Pop fly to the shortstop . - two and two . One out , one on . Tenth inning . The Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth : Double by Landreaux , groundout by Brock and a double by Marshall who ripped one past ... Once again , the stretch and the pitch . Ground ball , left side . And the Dodgers miss a good chance in the bottom of the 10th inning . And there are two groundouts to close it out . No runs , one hit and two left on . So the Dodgers , a tough loss to the Atlanta Braves here ... Keep it down . How many times do I have to tell you ? Keep it down . Dad ? Quiet . Keep it quiet . We could get one of those , for sure . - Let 's take a look at that right now . - All right . Thank you , Marge . Good luck . And remember , that 's two free ... - Thank you . - Never at that price again . Benefit ... And so ... - many things for you . Just think of all the things it will do ... Hi . You 're on the air with Bobbie . This is Marian . - Hi , Marian . - From Phoenix , Arizona . Now , what can we do today , Marian ? I 'm interested in the zirconia necklace for $ 99.99 . Now , are you just getting one today , Marian ? Well ... - Gosh , I hadn 't thought about getting ... - It makes a great present . - Is there a deal ? - Of course there 's a deal . There 's always a deal . Well , how much would two be ? Two would be 99 times two . Deduct $ 46 . Oh , well ... My husband 's gonna kill me . But all right , I 'll have two . All right . And you can just tell him that one of those is for your mother-in-law ... Here we have to call them by feature . And all for $ 149.99 . Oh , it certainly is . It 's on its way . Hey , kiddo . Kiddo . What 's going on ? The fire ! - Fire ? - In there ! What do you mean ? What are you doing with the dryer ? It just came on . I was just looking at it . Well , you shouldn 't play with things like that , David . - You could get hurt . - Dad , I wasn 't playing with it . It just came on and it was making a noise . I was in ... By ... By the television . What about the television ? Well , come here and look , and I 'll show you . Come on . It was really strange . I mean , there was , like , no picture at all ... There are times when you ... David , didn 't we decide on a bedtime for you tonight ? - It was right after the ball game . - Dad , I was in bed . That 's weird . What is ? It won 't turn off . - a Winston money-back guarantee . Next time you need to stop on a dime make sure you have my Winston brakes . It 's your main power switch . It shorted right out . What caused it to short out ? Well , okay . Take your voltage coming in the main power station in Canoga Park . Now , the electric company will tell you that it 's running smooth and steady . That 's a lie . I mean , you put that thing under a magnifying scope and that smooth , steady line starts looking like King Kong 's EKG . Ninety-volt drop-offs , 130-volt spikes . Pulses , they 're called . So , what are you saying ? Are you saying that I should call the electric company ? Well , no . See , in order to melt the switch like this in my opinion , it 'd take a couple thousand volts at least . And if the electric company ever burped that loud it 'd blow every damn circuit breaker in your house like that . Then I don 't understand . Hey , join the club . You know , there 's a lot of things I don 't understand . Take lightning . You know , my grandpa 's house was ... Look , there wasn 't any lightning last night , was there ? You want me to admit it ? Okay , I admit it . I don 't have a goddamn clue what happened to your TV set . Did you look at the back of that thing when I had it off ? I mean , you got enough chips in there to send a spaceship to Saturn . You know what I do ? I read the book . I do what it says . Hey , dude , check it out . Wow , what a skater . What a nerd . Wipeout ! Hey , watch out ! - Geek . - Turkey . - How sad . - Oh , please . Oh , my ... Man , that was bad . What 's your name ? My name 's Stevie . You just moved in , huh ? Yeah , just for a while . How come just for a while ? Because I don 't live here . I 'm just visiting . Well , then where do you live ? In Colorado , with my mother . Well , then where does your dad live ? Here . That 's who I 'm visiting . You 're not very smart , you know . We can play there now , you know . Where ? Inside his house ? No ! I wouldn 't go in there for anything . And anyway , my mom won 't let me . We can play in his yard now . So ? We couldn 't used to . He was mean . He used to yell all kind of crazy things at us . - Like what ? - See how that grass is dead ? He used to say we did that . He used to say we 'd sneak around at night and put poison on it . That 's pretty crazy , all right . My mom said he was crazy because of what happened to his wife . What ? Man , that was bad . One day we were all around after school and we started to hear all this yelling and screaming . The police came and an ambulance . And nobody knew what happened . Some of the kids said he must have murdered her . Did he ? - What 's your name ? - David . So , what happened ? She was washing the dishes and she turned on the garbage disposal and there was something stuck in it . It was this metal thing . It wasn 't even a knife or a fork . Some kind of metal thing . And when she turned it on it shot that metal thing right up into her face . Shot it up just like a gun . Isn 't that bad ? It shot it up right through her eyeball . - Flight 509 . - 509 ? Yes , that 's right . It 's from San Diego , and it will take ... - Hey , dude . - Fine . And what 's the airline ? Mom , listen , I know that . I know , but ... Please , Mom . Just listen , okay ? Mom , will you please just listen ? Mom . Please , would you just listen ? I know . I know that , Mom , but ... I want to come home . Please ? Why can 't I just come home now ? Because it scares me here . I don 't know why . It just does . No , it 's not Ellen . She 's okay . Yeah , she took me riding . Yeah , the other day . No . How can I ? I don 't even see him , you know ? He works all day and then when he gets home , he 's tired and all he wants to do is watch television or something . Yeah . I know , but ... Ellen ! What is it ? Ellen , look at that . Look at what ? Well , right there by the house . The grass . Is it getting enough water ? I watered it yesterday . Yeah , well , maybe it 's getting too much . Well , I 'll check the sprinklers . Maybe they 're not reaching there . Okay . Good . Yeah , look , and don 't forget about the tickets , okay ? Just , call him as soon as he 's open and then let me know . Tell him that I can come and pick them up on my lunch hour . Don 't worry . - See you at 6 . - Okay . - Bye-bye . - Bye . Yes . Oh , great . No , my husband will pick them up at 1 : 00 . Is that all right ? Well , I 'm going to have to replace the whole lawn . You see , it 's all scorched completely . - That 'll have to all come up . - Okay . And then there 's the shrubbery . Hey , David . You 're getting wet . Come on . I 'll make you some breakfast . - Okay ? - Good . See you . We can leave as soon as your dad gets back from work . We can have hot dogs at the ballpark . Does that sound okay ? Yeah . Well , you don 't sound very enthusiastic . What happened to his grass ? Well , you know the man across the street ? He said the kids were putting poison on it , didn 't he ? Well ... He said a lot of things after his wife died . Paranoid , you know ? I guess he stopped taking care of things and began to blame everyone else . So it started to die after his wife got killed ? Yeah . Well , no , actually , it was before but it got a lot worse afterwards . Why this sudden interest in poor Mr. Jordan 's grass ? I don 't know . What 's the matter ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . Stevie , come on . No , I don 't want to . Stevie , come on . Don 't be such a wimp . No . My mother told me not to . It 's dangerous . Come on , Stevie . She 's not gonna even know . No , I don 't want to . Stevie , if you don 't come on right now I 'm not gonna play with you ever again . Come on . Stevie ! Stevie , get back here right now ! - Stevie ! - No way ! Stevie ! Oh , man . What are you doing here ? Spooky , ain 't it ? Did it talk to you ? The voice in the wires . See ? Yeah . Fried him like an onion . Why do you figure he did it ? Smashed the place up , I mean . I don 't know . Ellen just said he went , like , crazy one night . Crazy ? That 's exactly what those son of a bitches would say . They probably had that poor bastard thinking he was going crazy . I know all about it . I must have seen 20 houses just like this one . And after the first few I started having me a real close look . And I know what I know , boy . But I 'm not telling it . Not anymore . No , sir . Let them call these other poor devils crazy if they want to but not me . All right ! Sports fans , let 's go . Great . Great seats , love . Look at this . First-base line . I think maybe you should sit down . We seem to have a problem . Well , it 's a long drive , you know ? We don 't want to be late . Okay . What is it ? David went over to the Jordan house this afternoon . That wasn 't very smart , David . It 's dangerous there . You could get hurt . I know . I know . But listen , please . He seems to think that what happened at the Jordan house is going to happen here . It comes in through the wires . I saw it . And that night that you were gone , I felt it . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Come on , now . Just slow down . You felt what ? The voice in the wires . He 's met some crazy old man in the Jordan house , and ... He 's not crazy . And Mr. Jordan wasn 't crazy . And the thing that killed him is in here now . And I just don 't want to stay here anymore . And I just want to get out of this house right now ! - Yeah . Look , look . - Bill , why don 't we ... ? Why don 't you go upstairs for a while and let me and Ellen talk about this . - No ! - Look ! Please . Just for a little while , okay ? I 'm sorry . Hey . Hey , come on . Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? Hey . Hey , come on . - What ? What ? - No , Dad . I don 't want to stay in the house . - Dad . No , Dad , please ! - Okay . - No ! Dad ! - Come on . Don 't make me go in there ! No , Dad , I don 't want to go in there ! No ! No , Dad ! No ! Dad , no ! No , I don 't want to go . No , Dad , you 're hurting me . Stop it . Dad , you 're hurting me ! No ! I don 't want to go back in the house ! No ! Did you ... ? Did you talk to him ? The old guy ? Well , after David calmed down , I went over to talk to him but he wasn 't there . His truck was gone . I don 't know . Do you think something could be wrong with the electricity ? It 's just that David seems so scared . Yeah . Well , I mean , of course he 's scared . It was ... It was that night we left him alone . That was the beginning of it . And today , jeez ... I mean , he goes into that house and some crazy bastard jumps down at him out of the ceiling . I mean , jeez ... I mean , that would have scared me to death . Weren 't you supposed to take this back ? Oh , I did . There was something wrong with the tape . It must have happened when the TV set broke . I had to buy it . It cost 60 bucks . It 's just that if he leaves in this state he 's never gonna want to come back here again . And how can I be his father if I never see him ? I mean , you understand ? I love him . I 'm ... He 's gonna be okay . Let 's get some sleep . We 'll work it out . Okay . I hope it was a lousy game . David . I 'm sorry I have to go to this meeting . You sure you don 't want to come over with me to the campus ? You could walk around . You gonna be all right ? Yeah . You sure ? Let 's get him ! I said to come in here . Your lunch is ready . Okay ! I 'm coming ! - Hi . - Hi . What are you doing ? Cobras are attacking the Terror Dome . Wanna play ? Come on , you can be the Cobras . No , not really . Okay , you can be the GI Joes . No . How do you get to the airport ? Why do you want to go to the airport ? Is there a bus or something ? No , I don 't think so . It 's a long way away . Are you going back to Colorado ? Yeah . I have the ticket . I just gotta get the time changed . Steven , get in here right now . Okay ! Maybe my mom will drive you . Do you want me to ask her ? No , it 's okay . Thanks , Steve . Steven , right now ! Okay ! So , what are you gonna do ? All right . Still keeps Will alive . Oh , there 's the sound . That means we 're out of time . We 'll automatically now start revealing one letter at a time . This is crucial . The first person to buzz in with the correct answer wins the money in the puzzle bank , and in this case , will win the game . So be very careful . Hands on your buzzers . You may buzz in as soon as the next letter is revealed but not before , or you 'll be disqualified . Ready ? Go . " H. " Will ? " They lived happily ever after . " And you will , yes . " They lived happily ever after . " David . - David . - Oh , my God . He was a lot more scared than hurt . The bruises from the collision and mild shock is what the doctor said . The gas didn 't really hurt him . But if he 'd been there any longer ... Oh , Jesus ! Mr. Rockland ? Can I show you something ? Yeah . Sure . I slugged your line with a new piece of pipe so now I 'm gonna turn the main back on relight all your pilots . Right here 's your problem . Split wide open . Actually , you 're pretty lucky . - Lucky ? - Oh , yeah . Volume of gas you had in here and the ignition of that station wagon turned on this whole place could have blown sky-high . Good grief . Look , I mean what could have caused this pipe to split like this ? Metal fatigue . You see that window right there ? Afternoon sun comes blazing through there right on that spot . Pipe heats up . Sun moves on , it cools back down . Expansion , contraction . Just wears the metal out , till one day ... Anyway , that new pipe ought to last you another 10 , 20 years . You might think about getting some Sheetrock on this wall help insulate it . Yeah , I will . - Okay , I 'll get that main right on . - Thank you very much . And then everything will be just fine again , won 't it ? Ma 'am ? Oh , something happens , and it almost kills someone and you people come here and you talk about pulses and metal fatigue and you pull out some pipe or switch and you say , " Here you are . Just slap in a new one of these . " And you don 't know what 's happening . You don 't know what 's really happening here , do you ? - Hey , hey . - Do you ? Ellen , come on . Come on . Calm down . Calm down now . - Bill , what is it ? - Please . Why is it doing this to us ? What does it want ? Lt ? Last night , I couldn 't sleep . I just lay in bed , listening . You know , all the little sounds there are at night . The furnace turning on and off , the refrigerator and ... I heard something else . Something growing inside the house . Getting stronger . The voice in the wires ? And what do you call all this ? An accident ? Yeah ! Yeah ! That 's exactly what I call it . An accident . I mean , what do you want me to call it ? You want me to believe that there 's some thing in the house that is trying to kill my son ? Come on . I mean , that is crazy . Yes . That 's what we called him . Poor Mr. Jordan . We said he was crazy . Was he ? Okay , okay . Listen to me now . Listen . What happened today was this . Right here . Look at it . See ? This is what happened . It 's not a monster . It 's not a plot . It 's not a plan . It 's not a conspiracy . It is what it is . It 's a stupid hunk of metal . And how many more things like this are there ? How many more things we don 't know about till someday one of them breaks and almost kills one of us ? Goddamn it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! What is this about ? You wanna leave too ? Is that it ? I don 't know what 's happening . Do you wanna leave too ? Oh , God ! Bill , you 're gonna be late for your meeting . I could have done that . Yeah , okay . So if anything should happen , anything just call me , and I 'll come right home . Okay . I promise . Yes , sir . I 'll be over at the place on Thornton . There 's no phone there . So if you run into a hitch , just work around it . Don 't leave . I want you to tell me about the houses . Tell you what , lady ? You know what . You told my son . I want you to tell me . Lady , I didn 't tell nobody around here nothing . And I 'll be glad to tell you the same thing . Okay . Okay . Turn off the faucets and I 'll tell you what to do . To do ? Yes , do . Or would you rather hide in your hole and hope for the best ? Pull the plug , lady . Pull all the plugs . Disconnect yourself . Fast . And not just up there at the top of the pole . That don 't mean nothing . It don 't just crawl in on your wires . It ain 't a thing . It 's a signal . A pulse . Kind of like a voice . So , what you 've got to do is to get rid of anything in your house that might have ears to hear it . Me , I 'm back to wood fires and kerosene lamps . My wife would like to kill me . But she thought I was nuts when I built the fallout shelter . But you wait and see . I was right about that one too . I heard a man on TV one time say that paranoia is just another word for heightened awareness . But you do what you want to , lady . What the hell do I know ? I 'm crazy . Wait ! The hardware store in the mall has got a special on kerosene . It smells some but it sure does make a pretty light . Ellen ? You up there ? Dad ! Hi . Oh , yeah . I ... I talked to your mother . She 's coming on Sunday . To take me back ? See , I was hoping that we could just sit down and maybe talk things over and ... Damn ! Hot ! David ! Honey ! Honey ! Honey ! I can 't get it open ! I gotta get something to break it . David ! Okay , okay . I 'm coming . I 'm coming . Bill . How is she ? She 's in the burn unit . They say she could be okay , but I don 't know . - video CD player could be yours for only $ 189 ... Bill . 7Hey , all right . Okay . Bill , if you need anything , Ruby and I will be upstairs . We 'll get some fresh linen and things for the guest room . Okay . Thanks . Ellen 's okay . I mean , I know it looked pretty bad and everything but they said that she would just have to stay there in the hospital for a while . And without Ellen here ... Your mom is coming here tomorrow morning . And we 're gonna pack you up and ... And you can go with her . Home . Look , so Howard ... Howard just said just now that you could stay here tonight . And it would be okay with me . I mean , if it would make you feel better . Can you stay here too ? Sure . If you want me to . Dad ? David ? Dad ? Dad ? Dad ? Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Come on . Okay . Help ! Help ! Help ! Somebody ! Dad ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! David ! - Put this blanket ... - Okay . Okay . - Come on ! - Go on ! - Dad , where are the keys ? - No ! No ! This way ! No , Dad ! - Okay . - Okay . Hurry , Dad . Hurry ! Stay back . Just stand back . Dad ... - Bill , stop it ! - What are you doing ? - For God 's sake ! - Come on , Bill . - Frank ! - What are you doing ? Where 's the cops ? What the hell are you doing ? Drop it . Drop the ax ! - Dad ! - Drop it ! I said , drop it ! Now ! That was your house that you just wrecked , wasn 't it ? Yes , it was . Yes . You must both be crazy . Yes , we are . Both of us . We are , aren 't we ? - We 're crazy . We 're ... - Yeah . Oh , God , are we crazy . Ripped by : SkyFury

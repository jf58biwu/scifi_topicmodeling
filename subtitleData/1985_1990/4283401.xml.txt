 ( DRAMATIC " 2001 " - TYPE MUSIC ) Three million years from Earth , the mining ship Red Dwarf . Its crew : Dave Lister , the last human alive ; Arnold Rimmer , a hologram of his dead bunkmate ; and a creature who evolved from the ship 's cat . Message ends . Additional : on our journey back to Earth , we have encountered many bizarre things . Only last month , we came across a moon shaped like Felicity Kendal 's bottom . We flew around that one a couple of times . OK . Rimmer , make this quick . Sir , I wish to place on record that Lister , David ... - Quicker . - .. smuggled aboard a consignment of the hallucinogenic fungi Titan mushrooms , more popularly known to the space beatnik community as " freaky fungus " . - Is this true ? - Sort of . .. and on February 26th at 0800 , engaged in conversation with Rimmer , Arnold . - For crying out loud , Rimmer ! - The outcome was a proposal to cook the aforementioned Rimmer breakfast . two sausages , fried potatoes and a large quantity of mushrooms . Having consumed this repast , second technician Rimmer , Arnold J , experienced what can only be described as a voyage to trip-out city . To whit , a major hallucinogenic fit . - Lister , is this true ? - No , sir . It was only one egg . The aforementioned Rimmer , to whit , me , then attended inspection parade . He was totally naked , except for leather driving gloves and blue swimming goggles . Under the influence of this psychedelic breakfast , he attacked two officers , believing them to be giraffes and armed and dangerous . - You 'd better have a good reason . - I have , sir . - Why ? - I thought it 'd be a laugh . Right . Two weeks PD , Lister . Dismissed . With respect , sir , the penalty for such a crime is 15 years ' imprisonment . - Thanks ! - I said dismissed . - Two weeks ? ! - That 's enough . - Two smegging weeks ? ! - I said that 's enough ! With respect , sir , you 've got your head up your fat arse . Eight weeks PD ! How come I get eight weeks and you get only two ? What did I do to deserve that ? - You stuck your pencil up his nose . - Only the rubber end . You ate his wife 's photograph . I thought it was a still from Planet Of The Apes . - Two teas . - ( MAN ) Excuse me . Listen , man , I 'm sorry about those mushrooms . I didn 't know . I 'm not totally irresponsible . I 'm a pretty straight and honest geezer . - Where 'd you get them ? - I nicked them from Headbanger Harris . - Why didn 't you tell the Captain ? - And get someone into trouble ? Eight weeks painting the smegging ship ? - I 'm sorry . - Get the spacesuits . ( RIMMER 'S VOICE ) Don 't panic , Arnold . Stay absolutely calm . I 'm coming out , so stay cool . Are you ready ? Here I come . There . That wasn 't too bad , was it ? We found a stasis leak on floor 16 . I 'm dead . You 're not , but if I save you , you won 't die , so neither will I. - Good book ? - It 's all right . - I didn 't think you read . - Not much , but this is good . - What is it ? - Your diary . What ? ! You sent secret love letters to Carol McCauley ? Lister , that is my private , personal , private diary , full of personal , private , personal things . It 's gone public . - You 've been reading it to the Cat ? - Only the best bits ! " Carol McCauley , your eyes are like two limpid pools of loveliness . " - Shut up . - " Your hair , a golden waterfall . " - Shut up . - " Your short skirts make me horny . " I order you to shut your face . - You can read my diary . - Who 'd want to ? It 's full of puerile nonsense about Kristine Kochanski . Ah , so you 've read my diary ? Yes , but at least I have the common decency to do it behind your back . That IS the decent thing to do . I 'm doing it for a reason . Look what I found in Kochanski 's quarters . - So ? - Look at it ! - It 's a wedding photograph . - And who 's the gorgeous hunk she 's marrying ? It 's you ! You didn 't marry Kochanski ! Exactly ! So , how is this possible , unless somehow we go back in time ? - What 's this got to do with my diary ? - It 's this bit about the mushrooms . When you saw your head , it wasn 't an hallucination . I think you were seeing you now in the past . There 's a wise old Cat saying , which I think applies in this situation . " What are you talking about , dog-breath ? " Listen . " The head came through the table " and said , ' I 'm from the future . We found a stasis leak on floor 16 . " ' - It wasn 't an hallucination . - What 's a stasis leak ? All right , dudes . What 's going down in groove town ? Hol , what 's a stasis leak ? Ooh , well , very , very basically , putting it simply in layman 's terms , a stasis leak is a leak , right ? In stasis . Hence the name " stasis leak " . - You don 't know , do you ? - No . Let 's go down to floor 16 and see what 's there . How come he never knows anything with an IQ of 6,000 ? 6,000 's not much . It 's the same as 12,000 car park attendants . But you don 't know anything . I 'm one of the most sophisticated computers ever devised by man . - I 'm next to infullible . - Infallible . Exactly . ( LISTER ) Floor 16 . ( RIMMER ) This 'll take ages . Welcome to Xpress Lifts ' descent to floor 16 . We 'll be going down 2,567 floors , and , for a small charge , you can enjoy the in-lift movie , Gone With The Wind . If you look right and left , you will notice there are no exits . In the highly unlikely event of the lift crashing , death is certain . Under your seat , you will find a cassette for recording your last will and testament , and from above your head a bag will drop containing cyanide capsules . This stuff freaks me out . To take the cyanide capsule , simply break open , like so , and place under the tongue . ( THUD ) Thank you for travelling Xpress Lifts . We apologise for the delay . You should apologise for the chicken ! First meal I 've had where the container tasted better than the food ! ( HUMMING ) This must be the stasis leak . OK . Here we go . It 's safe . Come through . What IS it ? It 's a rent in the space-time continuum . - What IS it ? - The stasis room freezes time , so if it leaks , it must preserve what it 's leaked into , like this room . - What IS it ? - It 's a point in the universe where laws of space and time don 't apply . - What IS it ? - It 's a hole into the past . A magic door ! Why didn 't you say ? It 's March 2nd . That 's three weeks before the crew got wiped out . ( ALL ) Hi . Do you mind ? This is the annual general meeting of the Agoraphobic Society ! I wonder , can we bring anybody back ? Not unless we want them turned into powder . - Who were you thinking of ? - Me . Let 's do it ! What 's the point in going , if you can 't bring anybody back ? - You 've seen the photo . I marry her . - But in three weeks , she 'll be dust . - You might as well marry a box of Daz . - I 'm staying with her . Staying with her ? For the sake of three weeks , you 're giving up your life ? - Yeah . - I don 't believe it . - Mr Selfish or what ? - Eh ? What about me ? I 've given you the best years of my death ! Is that it , then ? Three years . " Thanks , pal . I 'm off " ! No regrets ? Not so much as a lump in your throat ? No , it 's Kochanski . The only lump you 've got is down your trousers . I 'm going for it , Rimmer . You don 't get many shots at happiness , so go for them all . I 'm sharing a bunk with a Barbara Cartland character . - What would you do ? - I don 't know , I ... Do what you like . - Rimmer , you don 't even like me . - Don 't I ? Fine . - You don 't , though . - That 's what you think ? I will tell you something that 'll stun you . - What ? - You 're right . I don 't like you . I don 't like what you stand for , but for some weird reason ... I don 't know . What 's the point ? Everything always goes wrong for me . I 'm the only person in the world to buy a Topic bar without one hazelnut in it . It happens , you know , Rimmer . You meet people , then you move on . When I was ten , I had a friend called Duncan . My best mate . Taught me everything , like how to put mirrors on me toecaps to look up girls ' skirts . His dad had to move to Spain because of a job ... a bank job he pulled in Purley . Never saw him again . I think of him every time I look at me shoes . Don 't try and explain it , Lister . I don 't know why I 'm even surprised . Everyone always leaves me in the end . Girls , parents ... I had a pet lemming once . I loved that little lemming . I built him a little wall , so he could hurl himself off it . He didn 't want for anything . One Christmas , I put my finger in his cage with some mince pie . He bit me ! He sunk his teeth into my fingers and wouldn 't let go . In the end , I had to smash his brains out against the wall . That little lemming broke my heart . The little git completely ruined my helicopter wallpaper . Maybe there is a way to bring people back from the past . - Oh , how ? - Well , there 's a spare stasis booth . We could bring one person back if they went into suspended animation . - They 'd survive the accident . - Yeah . Then we could bring them out , and bingo ! Brilliant ! I could save my own life ! - I could bring her back . - I could bring me back . There 'd be a dead me and a living me , one for the week and one for Sunday best . Hey ! There 's only room for one - Krissie ! Rimmsie ! Aow ! Don 't look , baby . It 'll drive you crazy ! What do you think ? You said look inconspicuous . Put this on . You 'll stand out a mile like that . - I wouldn 't use this on my shoes . - You look like you 're on Come Jiving . - I 'll look like an ordinary person ! - That 's the point . People won 't say , " Who 's he ? He 's gorgeous ! " - Put it on . - Oh ... Well , maybe if I widen the lapels , put in some vents ... - Put it on ! - Where 's Alphabet-Head ? Rimmer ? He sneaked off last night . He 's already back in the past , trying to save his own worthless hide . You reading me , Hol ? - I can see right down your gob . - Let 's go . I don 't like being a watch , dangling upside down . And warn me before you put your hand in your pocket . Gave me a fright , that sweet covered in fluff . - Cheers , Hol . - Here we go again . Put that on ! ( BOTH SINGING MERRILY ) Shh ! Here it is , man . Just stick with me , OK ? Um ... Did you order a kiss-o-gram ? Excuse me , did a short human with pigtails come through here ? ( LISTER ) Yo , Cat ! Don 't worry . It 's personality that counts . Felicitations , beautiful ladies . Back from planet leave ? Let me take those cases . My name is Olaf Petersen . I am good in bed . It 's always an honour to carry the luggages of such beautiful ladies . - Petersen ! - Oh , hi . Petersen ! How are you ? I don 't believe it ! It 's you ! I 've missed you . Give us a kiss , you smegger . He 's just a friend ! - I don 't believe it ! - He hasn 't seen me since breakfast ! - I 'll see you later ! - Sure . - I 'll come to your room ! - Lister , you 're dead ! That was Petersen , an old mate of mine . We were like that . Just think , I 'm gonna be able to see everybody again . Give us a break . It 's like a tropical rainforest . - Sorry , Hol . - Wow ! I 've never been this close to women before ! I don 't know what it is , but I want to do it a lot ! ( LISTER ) I wonder what Rimmer 's doing . ( RIMMER ) .. I thought it was a still from Planet Of The Apes . - ( LISTER ) Two teas . - Excuse me . ( LISTER ) Listen , man , I 'm sorry about those mushrooms . I didn 't know . I 'm not totally irresponsible . - Why didn 't you tell the Captain ? - And get someone into trouble ? Eight weeks painting the smegging ship ? - I 'm sorry . - Get the spacesuits . ( RIMMER 'S VOICE ) Don 't panic , Arnold . Stay absolutely calm . I 'm coming out , so stay cool . Are you ready ? Here I come . We found a stasis leak on floor 16 . I 'm dead . You 're not , but if I save you , you won 't die , so neither will I. - I know what you are . - You do ? - You 're a mushroom , aren 't you ? - A what ? - An hallucination . Go away . - No , I 'm you from the future . - In three million years , you 're dead . - Am I really ? - Yes , unless you do something now . - What do you suggest ? More roughage ? You 're not listening ! You must go into stasis . - Go away ! - I 'll be back soon . Stay calm . It 's gone now . Rimmer . Now you 've turned into a chicken ! I just want to apologise . We both got a little carried away . - I 've been under a lot of pressure . - Go away . I shouldn 't have given you PD . I just got a little riled . Did you indeed ? How sad , Captain Paxo . What ? Oh , oh , this . No , I ... This is for the party tonight . Half man , half chicken ... You don 't scare me . I know what you are . ( CLUCKS ) OWRGHHH ! Now cluck off before I extract your giblets and shove an onion between the lips you never kiss with . Forget everything I 've just said ! You have got eight months PD ! Well , we have a problem . I don 't take orders from poultry . No , Rimmer , make that eight years ! Fine . I 'll make a note of it . Eight ... years ... There we go . - Is Kristine in ? - No , she 's on planet leave . Oh , smeg . Where 's she staying ? - The Ganymede Holiday Inn . - Cheers . ( LISTER ) .. A-N-S-K-I . Kochanski . Look ... ( SUITCASE ) Excuse me . No , down here . Have you seen a man who 's lost his luggage ? - No . - Oh , no . I bet he 's gone to the wrong airport again . Ah ! Dog ! And he 's trying to strangle that woman ! Don 't worry , madam . His strangling days are over ! Cat , I 've got it . 008 . This way ! Why are you attacking people 's clothing ? Aow ! Yeah ! She 's already married . What about the photograph ? I 'm not the groom . He 's the groom ! ( CAT ) She 's not as stupid as we thought ! Why do women always leave me for total smegheads ? Why do they dump me for men who wear turtlenecks and smoke pipes ? I mean , natural yoghurt eaters . Reliable , sensible , dependable , and lots of other words that end in " ible . " I bet he 's obsessed with house prices and spends life in antique fairs looking for bargains and drinking wine . It 's never beer , is it ? It 's always wine . " What do you want on your cornflakes ? " " I 'll have wine , please ! " Smeg ! You can tell all that just from a photograph ? ( HOLLY ) Oi , not your pockets . It 's horrible down there . There 's a big hole . It 's an unbelievable view . Reminds me of that film , Attack Of The Killer Gooseberries . Come on , Hol . I 'm broken up . I was in love once ... a Sinclair ZX-81 . People said , " Holly , she 's not for you . " She was cheap , stupid and wouldn 't load . Not for me , anyway . - What are you trying to say , Hol ? - It 's better to have loved and lost than to listen to Olivia Newton-John . - Why 's that ? - Anything 's better than that . - Hi . It 's you . - Hi . - Come in . - No , we were just passing . - Come in . - No , it 's OK . Cat ! Come on , We 've got to go ! ( CAT ) Aow ! - I just got married . - Oh , great . - He 's in the shower . You 'll like him . - Oh , I bet . - Do you want a screwdriver ? - I 'd rather have a hammer . How you doin ' , kid ? What is this ? An ugly convention ? - Where did you come from ? - The bathroom . - You don 't look pleased to see me . - Frankly , I 'm not . I thought I was getting married . - ( KOCHANSKI ) You did . - HE did . - He 's you . - No , I 'm me . He 's him . If he 's you and you 're him and he 's him ... am I still me ? Who 's eatin ' this chicken ? - What the hell is going on ? - Look ... Listen ... In five years , you find a way to come back in time . - So , it does work out ? - Eventually . How about a frenchie from me future bride ? No way . On your space-bike . So , listen ... What do I do now ? - Go back and wait for five years . - Have I always been such a smeghead ? - You 've always been like that . - So , you 've lived the last five years . What 's the single most important piece of advice that you can give me ? Erm ... Oh , yeah . Three years from now , you 'll enter a parallel universe . You 'll materialise on an exact replica of Earth in the year 1989 . You 'll want to go to the theatre . Don 't see Run For Your Wife . ( LAUGHS ) - Smeghead . - And you . We 've pumped your stomach , we 've changed your blood . Get some rest . So , they won 't come back again ? Just stay calm , keep cool and get some sleep . There he is . Sleeping like a baby . I 'm going to kill him . If you need anything , call Holly . ( RIMMER 'S VOICE ) Don 't panic , Arnold , but I 've had a think , and I think I can explain this to you . ( RIMMER ) Hi . - Hi . I 'm staying calm this time . - Good . There you are . I 've been looking everywhere . - Not now , Lister . - TWO Listers ! And a strange man with large teeth ! - Hey , I 'm a cat . - Of course ! Come in ! Sit down ! - Yo ! - Three Listers ! Splendid ! Perhaps Lister here would go to the fridge and open some wine for Lister and Lister ? Rimmer here doesn 't drink , because he 's dead , but I wouldn 't mind a glass . Don 't get into a flap , but I 'm the Rimmer from the double-double future . I 'm the Rimmer who 's with the Lister who married Kochanski . From here on , things get a bit confusing ... ( ALL CHATTER ) Please , before anyone says anything else , I 'd like to make a little speech . ( SCREAMS ) Go away ! # It 's cold outside # There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

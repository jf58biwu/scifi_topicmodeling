 This is a fine place you have here , Dr. Nichols . Thank you . Your knowledge of engineering is most impressive . Back home we call him " The miracle worker . " Indeed . May I offer you something , gentlemen ? I might be able to offer something to you . Yes ? I noticed you 're still working with polymers . Still ? What else would I be working with ? Aye , what else , indeed . I 'll put it another way . How thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 ' x 1 0' to withstand the pressure of 1 8,000 cubic feet of water ? That 's easy . 6 inches . We stock that size . I have noticed . Now , suppose ... just suppose ... I were to show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but be only 1 inch thick ? Would that be worth something to you , eh ? You 're joking . Perhaps the professor could use your computer . Please . Computer . Computer . Ah . Hello , computer . Just use the keyboard . The keyboard . How quaint . " Transparent aluminum " ? That 's the ticket , laddie . It would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix . You would be rich beyond the dreams of avarice . So , is it worth something to you , or should I just punch up " clear " ? No ! No . Not now , Madelaine ! What exactly did you have in mind ? Well , a moment alone , please . You realize , of course , if we give him the formula , we 're altering the future . Why ? How do we know he didn 't invent the thing ? Yeah . Sure you won 't change your mind ? Is there something wrong with the one I have ? A little joke . Bye , old friend . Wait a minute ! How did you know Gracie 's pregnant ? Nobody knows that . Gracie does . I 'll be right here . What , he 'll just hang around the bushes while we eat ? It 's his way . Do you trust me ? Implicitly . A large mushroom , pepperoni with extra onions , and Michelob , please . O.K. Great choice . And you , sir ? Make that two . Thank you . Well ... how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist ? Just lucky , I guess . You 're upset about losing the whales , aren 't you ? You 're very perceptive . How will that be done exactly ? They 'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there . That 's the last you 'll see of them ? See , yes , but we 'll tag them with radio transmitters so that we can keep tabs on them . You know , I could take those whales somewhere ... where they 'd never be hunted . You can 't even get yourself from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift . If you have a low opinion a my abilities , how come we 're having dinner ? Sucker for hard luck cases . Ha ha ha . Cheers . Besides ... why are you traveling with that ditzy guy who knows Gracie 's pregnant and calls you admiral ? Where could you take them ? Hmm ? My whales . Where would they be safe ? It 's not so much a place as a time . The time would have to be right now . Why right now ? No humpback born in captivity has ever survived . The problem is they won 't be that much safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year . So you see , that , as they say , is that . Damn . What is that ? What 's what ? You have a pocket pager . Are you a doctor ? What is it ? I said don 't call me . Sorry , Admiral . We thought you should know . They 're beaming them in now . O.K. , tell them phasers on stun . Good luck . Kirk out . You want to try it from the top ? Why don 't you tell me when those whales are leaving ? Who are you ? Who do you think ? Don 't tell me . You 're from outer space . No , I 'm from Iowa . I only work in outer space . Well , I was close . I knew outer space would come into this sometime . The truth ? I 'm all ears . O.K. The truth . I am from what on your calendar would be the late 23rd century . I 've come back in time ... to bring two humpback whales with me , in an attempt to ... repopulate the species . Well , why didn 't you just say so ? I mean , why all the coy disguises ? You want the details ? I wouldn 't miss this for all the tea in China . When are those whales being released ? O.K. What the hell ? Your friend was right . Gracie 's not only pregnant , she is very pregnant , and at noon tomorrow , in what is sure to be a media circus , the whales get shipped out . Noon tomorrow ? Are we leaving ? Come on . We haven 't much time . Make that to go . Who gets the bad news ? Don 't they use money in the 23rd century ? Well , we don 't . Now hear this . Smoking lamp is out while transferring fuel . How long ? Depends on how much shielding there is between us and the reactor . Well , ahem , Admiral , that was the briefest dinner I 've ever had and certainly the biggest fish story I 've ever heard . You asked . Uh , you tell me something . George and Gracie 's transmitter - what 's the radio frequency ? Sorry , that 's classified . Look , I don 't have a clue who you are ! You wouldn 't want to show me around your spaceship , would you ? That 's not my first choice . Well , there we are . Let me tell you something . I 'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century . If I have to , I 'll get them from the open sea . I 'd much rather have yours . It 's better for me , better for you , it 's better for them . Think about it . Who are you ? Think about it , but don 't take too long . I 'm out of time . If you reconsider , I 'll be here . Here ? In the park . Right . The tank will be finished by morning . That 's cutting it close . What about team two ? No word since beaming . We 'll wait for their call . Damn it ! We got two perfect whales right in our hands . If we don 't move quickly , we 'll lose them . In that event , our mission will probably fail . Our mission ? Spock , you 're talking about the end of every life on earth . You 're half human . Haven 't you got any goddamn feelings about that ? There it is again . That 's too weird . Commander ? I thought you gents were running a test program . Yes , but we 're apparently getting a power drain . It must be coming from inside the ship . CIC command duty officer , Commander Rogerson . Yes , Chief , we 're tracking that , too . What do you think ? Scotty , we 're ready for beam-out . Scotty , can you hear me ? Confirmed . Roger that . Mardet commanding officer . This is the command duty officer , Commander Rogerson . We have an intruder in number four MMR . I say again - we have an intruder in number four MMR . Scotty , do you read ? Scotty , come in , please . Yes . I hardly hear you . My transporter power is down to minimal . I 'll bring you in one at a time . Take the collector . You go first . Stand by . Scotty . Hello . Come in , please . Scotty . How soon ? Chekov ! You 're breaking up ! Please signal again ! Chekov , can you hear me ? Scotty , now would be a good time . Freeze ! Chekov ! I 've lost him . " Commander Pavel Chekov . " Starfleet . United Federation of Planets . " All right , Commander . Is there anything you 'd want to tell us ? Like what ? Like who you really are , what you 're doing here , and what these things are . I am Pavel Chekov , a commander in Starfleet , United Federation of Planets . Service number 656-5827d . All right . Let 's take it from the top . The top of what ? Name . My name ? No , my name ! Play games with me , mister , and you 're through . I am ? May I go now ? What do you think ? He 's a Russkie . That 's the stupidest thing I 've heard . Of course , he 's a Russkie , but he 's a retard or something . We better call Washington . Don 't move . O.K. Make nice . Give us the ray gun . I warn you - lie on the floor , or I 'll stun you . Go ahead . Stun me . I 'm very sorry , but ... Must be the radiation . Emergency . We have a security breach . General alarm . Hit the deck ! Aah ! Man down . Get a corpsman over here . Yes , sir . Any luck ? Nothing . I shouldn 't have left him . You did what was necessary . Keep trying . You 'll find him . Scotty , you promised me an estimate on the dilithium crystals . It 's going slowly , sir . It 'll be well into tomorrow . That 's not good enough . You 've got to do better . I 'll try , sir . Scott out . He 's in a wee bit of a snit . He 's a man of deep feelings . Aye . What else is new ? They left last night . We didn 't want a mob scene . Besides , it 's easier on you this way . You sent them away without even letting me say goodbye ? You son of a bitch ! Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Admiral Kirk ! Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Wait ! Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Oof ! . Admiral ! Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Can you hear me ? They 're gone ! I need your help ! Are you in there ? Admiral , we have a problem ! Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Can you hear me ? Admiral ! Admiral Kirk ! Can you hear me ? Admiral Kirk ! Can you hear me ? I need your help ! Oh , my God . Aah ... Aah ! Hello , Alice . Welcome to Wonderland . Oh , it 's true . It 's true ? What you said . Yes , it is . You picked a great time to drop in . Oh , take it easy . We need your help . Is any of this real ? Yes , it 's real . Take a look . Storage tanks for your whales . Admiral , they 're gone . Gone ? They were taken last night . They 're in Alaska by now . Damn . But they 're tagged . You can go find them , right ? We can 't go anywhere . What kind of a spaceship is this ? It 's a spaceship with a missing man . Admiral , full power has been restored . Thank you , Mr. Spock . Hello , doctor . Welcome aboard . Admiral , are you there ? Yes , Uhura . What 's wrong ? I 've located Chekov , sir . They 're taking him to emergency surgery right now . Where ? Mercy Hospital . Mercy Hospital ? That 's in the Mission district . They report his condition as critical . He 's not expected to survive . Jim ... you 've got to let me go in there . Don 't leave him in the hands of20th century medicine . Admiral , may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct ? We must help Chekov . Is that the logical thing to do , Spock ? No , but it is the human thing to do . Right . Will you help us ? How ? Well ... we 'll have to look like physicians . We 'll try down here . You check there . Ohh . Ohh . What 's the matter with you ? Kidney dialysis . Dialysis ? My God . What is this , the dark ages ? Here . Now , you swallow that . If you have any problems , just call me . Here . I got it . Let 's go . Bones . He 's being held in the security corridor . One flight up . His condition is critical . Come on . Uh , excuse me . We 'll take that . Hold the door ! Hold that door . Emergency . You were there when it happened ? Yeah . I heard everything . Weintraub says radical chemotherapy , or she 'll croak . Well , what about Gottlieb ? All he talked about was image therapy . I thought they 'd punch each other out . Unbelievable . You have a different view , doctor ? It sounds like the goddamn Spanish Inquisition to me . Bad day . Out of the way . Sorry . I have strict orders - Ohh ! Want an acute case on your hands ? This woman has immediate postprandial upper abdominal distention ! Ohh ! Get out of the way . What did you say she 's got ? Cramps . Who are you ? Why aren 't you masked ? Who are these people ? I don 't know . What the hell is that ? What are you doing ? Tearing of the middle meningeal artery . What 's your degree in , dentistry ? How do you explain slowing pulse , low respiratory rate , and coma ? Funduscopic examination ! That 's unrevealing in these cases . A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure ! My God , man ! Drilling holes in his head isn 't the answer . The artery must be repaired . Let me save this patient before it 's too late . I 'm going to have you removed . Doctor , such unprofessional behavior . Into that little room , please . What is that , a gun ? They must be crazy . Who is that guy ? I have no idea . He melted the lock ! We 're dealing with medievalism here . Chemotherapy . Funduscopic examinations . Come on , Chekov . Wake up . Pavel . Can you hear me ? He 's coming around , Jim . Pavel , talk to me . Name . Rank . Chekov , Pavel . Rank ... Admiral . How 's the patient , doctor ? He 's going to make it . He ? You came in with a she . One little mistake . Get us out of here . They 've taken the patient . Get some help . Hold it ! Hold it ! Police ! Not now , Pavel . Hold it ! Look out ! Look out ! The doctor gave me a pill , and I grew a new kidney . Fully functional ? Fully functional . What the hell 's going on ? Freeze ! Where would the whales be by now ? If you have a chart , I 'll show you . All I need is the radio frequency . What are you talking about ? I 'm coming with you . Our next stop is the 23rd century . Well , I don 't care . I 've got to help those whales ! There isn 't time to argue or tell you how much you 've meant to us . The radio frequency , please . The frequency 's 401 megahertz . Thank you ... for everything . Scotty , beam me up . Surprise . Spock , where 's the power you promised ? One damn minute , Admiral . I 'm ready . Let 's find George and Gracie . Sulu ? I 'm trying to remember how this thing worked . You tricked me . You need me . Ready , sir . Take a seat . Now , Mr. Sulu . What the hell was that ? Cloaking device is stable . All systems normal . Stabilize energy reserve . Report , helm . Maintaining impulse climb . Wing 5 by 0 . Helm steady . Advise reaching 1 0,000 . Steer 31 0 . 31 0 , aye . Uhura , scan for the whales . 401 megahertz . Scanning , sir . 1 0,000 MSL , Admiral . Wing , cruise configuration . Full impulse power . Aye , sir . 31 0 to the Bering Sea . ETA , 1 2 minutes . Scotty , are the whale tanks secure ? Aye , sir , but I 've never beamed up 400 tons before . 400 tons ? It 's not just the whales . It 's the water . Yes , of course . The whales - any contact ? Negative , sir . You present the appearance of a man with a problem . Your perception is correct , doctor . To return us to the moment we left the 23rd century , I 've used our journey through time as a referent , calculating the elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve . Naturally . So , what 's your problem ? Acceleration is no longer a constant . Well , then , you 'll have to take your best shot . Best shot ? Guess , Spock . Your best guess . Guessing is not in my nature , doctor . Well ... nobody 's perfect . That 's it . That 's it ! Affirmative . Contact with the whales . Bearing . Bearing 327 . Range 600 nautical . Put it on the screen . How ? On screen . I have a signal closing in on the whales , bearing 328 degrees . Let 's see it . What kind of ship is that ? It 's a whaling ship , doctor . Are we too late ? Full power descent , Mr. Sulu . Aye , sir . Full power descent . 1 0 seconds , sir . All right , Scotty . It 's up to you . 1 0 seconds , Admiral . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Admiral , there be whales here ! Well done , Mr. Scott . How soon can we assume warp speed ? Full power now , sir . If you will , Mr. Sulu . Aye , sir . Warp speed . Mr. Sulu , you have the comm . I 'm taking our guest to look at her whales . Spock , have you accounted for the whales and water in your time reentry ? Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures , so ... I will make a guess . A guess ? You , Spock ? That 's extraordinary . I don 't think he understands . No , Spock . He means that he feels safer about your guesses than most other people 's facts . Then you 're saying it is a compliment . It is . Ah . Then I 'll make the best guess I can . " They say the sea is cold , but the sea contains the hottest blood of all . " Whales weep not . D.H. Lawrence . You know , it 's ironic . When man was killing these creatures , he was destroying his own future . The beasties seem happy to see you , doctor . I hope you like our little aquarium . A miracle , Mr. Scott . A miracle ? That 's yet to come . What does that mean ? Our chances of getting home aren 't too good . You might have lived longer if you 'd stayed . I belong here . I am a whale biologist . Suppose you do get them through ? Who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales ? You got a point . What 's that ? Admiral , you better get up there . We 're having a power fall-off . Stay with them . On my way . Hold on tight , lassie . It gets bumpy from here . Warp 7.5 ! 7.9 ! Shields at maximum . Mr. Sulu , that 's all I can give you . Can we make breakaway speed ? Hardly , Admiral . I cannot guarantee we 'll escape the sun 's gravity . I shall attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory . Warp 8 . 8.1 . Maximum speed , sir . Admiral , I need thruster control . Acceleration thrusters at Spock 's command . Steady . Steady . Now ! Did braking thrusters fire ? They did , Admiral . Then where the hell are we ? The probe . Condition report , Spock . No data , Admiral . Computers are nonfunctional . The mains are down , sir . Aux power is not responding . Switch to manual control , Mr. Sulu . I have no controls , sir . My God , Jim , where are we ? Out of control and blind as a bat . Get him back ! Get him back ! Look ! They 're heading for the bridge ! Keep the nose up if you can . We 're in the water ! Blow the hatch ! This is the right place . Get the whales out before we sink . Abandon ship ! Scotty , can you hear me ? Move ! Move ! See to the safety of all hands . I will . Lassie , get my arm . I 've got it . You got it ? Yeah . Scotty ? Admiral ! I 'm here , Scotty ! I 'm here ! You 'll be all right . The whales are trapped . They 'll drown . There 's no power to the bay doors . Explosive override . It 's underwater . It can 't be reached . You go on ahead and close the hatch . Admiral , you 'll be trapped . Go on ! Do you see them ? Oh ! There ! Why don 't they answer ? Why don 't they sing ? Mr. President , we have power . Council is now in session . You all take your seats . Bring in the accused . Captain Spock , you do not stand accused . Mr. President , I stand with my shipmates . As you wish . The charges and specifications are conspiracy , assault on federation officers , theft of federation property , namely the Starship Enterprise , sabotage of the U.S.S. Excelsior , willful destruction of federation property , specifically the aforementioned U.S.S. Enterprise , and finally , disobeying direct orders of the Starfleet commander . Admiral Kirk , how do you plead ? On behalf fall of us , Mr. President , I 'm authorized to plead guilty . So entered . Because of certain mitigating circumstances , all charges but one are summarily dismissed . The remaining charge , disobeying orders of a superior officer , is directed solely at Admiral Kirk . I 'm sure the admiral will recognize the necessity of keeping discipline in any chain of command . I do , sir . James T. Kirk , it is the judgment of this council that you be reduced in rank to captain , and that as a consequence of your new rank , you be given the duties for which you have repeatedly demonstrated unswerving ability - the command of a starship . Silence . Captain Kirk , you and your crew have saved this planet from its own shortsightedness , and we are forever in your debt . Excuse me . I 'm so happy for you , I can 't tell you . Thank you so much . Wait . Where are you going ? You 're going to your ship . I 'm going to mine . Science vessel . I got 300 years of catch-up learning to do . You mean this is goodbye ? Why does it have to be goodbye ? Well ... Like they say in your century , I don 't even have your telephone number . How will I find you ? Don 't worry . I 'll find you . See you around the galaxy . Father . I 'm returning to Vulcan within the hour . I 'd like to take my leave of you . It was kind of you to make this effort . It was no effort . You are my son . Besides ... I 'm most impressed with your performance in this crisis . Most kind . As I recall , I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet . It is possible that judgment was incorrect . Your associates are people of good character . They are my friends . Yes , of course . Do you have a message for your mother ? Yes . Tell her ... I feel fine . Live long and prosper , father . Live long and prosper , my son . The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe . We 'll get a freighter . With all respect , doctor , I 'm counting on Excelsior . Excelsior ? Why would you want that bucket of bolts ? A ship is a ship . Whatever you say , sir . Thy will be done . My friends ... we 've come home . Helm ready , Captain . All right , Mr. Sulu . Let 's see what she 's got .

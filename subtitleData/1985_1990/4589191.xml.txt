 I am Finch . The one people call Finch the architect . And this city is my city . Only this underground world created by me can save you from the death waiting outside . Because our planet is agonizing . His surface is poisoned and those saying the opposite are liars . We must stay together . Here . There 's no other choice . " The Building opens his doors for all your pleasures . " Walter , come here ! - You 're doing well , General ? - Perfect , Walter . Here is our last shelter . It makes me happy . I 'm here to serve you . It 's a tailor-made job for sycophants and pimps . I will never get used to it . Never , never , never ! I 'm not born for this . - You 're mine , you 're mine Lily ! - Let me go ! - You 're mine ! - Let me go ! - Anna will be testifying this afternoon . - And then she will be free . Free ? You know Walter wants her dead . - You think she won 't come back ? - Of course she won 't . And if we bet ? - You 're playing ? - Who are you to bet on Anna 's life ? What a cunt ! All of you must forget Anna . We could have more fun around here . It 's a sad and inhuman place . Like all men , Walter doesn 't give a shit . And he 's not what he used to be anymore . Someday I 'll be number one here at the Building . Then everything will be changed . Yes , my lovely , yes . And what have you done for Anna ? Beautiful and a gifted expert , this Anna . I 've told you again and again . Yes , he killed Lily . Do I have to pledge my word another time ? Ok , I swear . You talk about the prostitute Lily Hachecoeur . Yes , she was my friend . I 'm here to testify and he will pay for his crime . You 're maintaining that the accused Roger Spiriteon has murdered the prostitute , Lily Hachecoeur . I 'm maintaining that . I 'm Walter Spiriteon . And Roger Spiriteon is my brother ! So what , judge ? I asked you to do the necessary for my brother . But 5 years for murder with first degree is nothing . - 5 years ! You know what 5 years in jail mean ? It means 5 years rotting alive . With only hope . But you don 't give a shit about my brother 's pain . I love my brother ! Does a rat like you can understand that kind of feeling ? Do you , bitch ? I will not be able to hold on that long ! You have to . You have to hold on . Surveillance control ask Walter Spiriteon to get out immediately . We have a nice name ! It has punch ! Spi-ri-teon ! Walter you 're everything to me . I should not tell you . When you 're out Anna will be all yours at the Building . Little Anna . Only yours . And here comes Anna Voisa ! The lamb . Beware my lovely . Walter 's hunchmen are always on time . And always efficient . You 're counting on Liberty ? You 're wrong . These assholes won 't save your skin . You 'd like to be in my skin . My lovely . You 'd love it . Die . You made your choice . Here . You 're free to go . Yes . You 're free . Free from what ? " Shuttle departure towards medical area . Restricted to red cards holders . " She shouldn 't be let free . She shouldn 't . This whore belongs to me . She belongs to me and Roger . If I had seen her I would have made her change her mind . She would never have testified against Roger . If that scum judge had not released her . - It 's not the judge , it 's Finch . - Fuck Finch . Mario will find that little slut . I had no choice , you know . Lily and I , we were sisters like . We started at the same time . All went well between the two of us . On this one , we 're sixteen . We grew up together , Lily and I , in a sordid place . Even in our teen years we dreamed about the Building . The road to success ! My mother cried of happiness ! Me , I 'm not that ambitious . The Building always made me nervous . - I prefer to stay here in my lab . - I would like to stay here with you . But I have to leave this city . - You 're afraid ? - Walter 's men are everywhere - Liberty 's men too . Slowly , slowly . " Shuttle departure towards city forum . Embarcation at once . " Be careful , a man behind you ! Only a small injection to calm you down . Be reasonable . Bitch ! You know what the little whore did ? She killed Mario . Enough with amateurs . We need a pro . Don 't we ? - You should try Nelson . - Nelson ? To end with this , in Northern Europe , areas suitable for cultivation decreased of 0,7 % . Tendency confirmed for the six next months . Is that all ? This morning we got some new intel on the Liberty group . - What 's your opinion ? - Boring . - " Boring " . - Walter Spiriteon is here , dad . Come here , Walter . You know my future city means everything to me . Walter . Give up with the drama . You 're a business man now , you 're not a hoodlum anymore . I can 't let this whore escape . Your brother is a wretch . You 're blind , Walter . This nuisance is playing with you . You roughed up the judge , the Buiding doesn 't bring money anymore and you 're exhausting yourself trying to avenge your brother . You have to stop . You let go with this girl or Roger ... Understood ? I understand . You let my brother live . Hello , Kim ! You come to visit us , the living people ! I 'm working on your inheritance ! Remi , my apprentice . He 's starting in the business . Why are we here ? WALTER SPIRITEON ! Walter , you can 't keep her prisoner here for five years . First you got to bring her back here . I want her here when Roger will be out . It will be my gift . It makes me sick working for your brother . Is this the famous Walter Spiriteon ? I didn 't figure them looking like this . You see them as they are . Small , aged and outdated . Then it will be Nelson . As soon as she 's here you kill this megalomaniac . Then this case will be engulfed in silentness . The job Walter is about to propose you is not approved by Finch . It suits me well . - Maybe it 's Walter 's last mistake . - I 'm not so sure . Kim , Mrs " techs " . It 's not about killing . I hope I 'm not disappointing you too much . Roger 's trial . I 've told you again and again . Yes , he killed Lily . You got to bring her alive . Here . Little Anna . I 'm here to testify and he will pay for his crime . I will tear your heart out ! Liberty is protecting her . Ziegler knows a way in . Our sector . - Our level . - " Our level " . It looks like the exact blueprint of our city . - In two days we saw it was wrong . - Maybe a real blueprint never existed . What if they were left here precisely to be stolen by us ? What 's important is that we 've given them again evidence about Liberty 's reality . It 's always a victory to show our force . It 's true . Karl is right . It 's also a victory to have Anna with us . If we could succeed in getting her out of the city everybody will talk about us . We have a safety device for her . It should work fine . It 's our turn to move . I can 't sleep . I didn 't know I was locked in . You 've no right to say that . We all take risks . Even those who never saw you . I 'm sorry . You must understand . My safety is a concern only for me . Cookie , what 's wrong with you , my sweetie ? Astrid , where 's Anna ? Astrid , where 's Anna ? Far from here . Not you . No matter . She escaped from you . Stop ! Where 's Anna , Astrid ? Huh ? If you don 't cry , it will be fine . You 've had your fun ? Leave him alone . Don 't look at me .

Travellers Info : carbon monoxyde rate in embarcation area ... Calm down , don 't shout ! Nobody saw us ? All your papers for travellling . Wait , wait . I 've heard so much about you . Give me your strength . - Where is she ? - Will you speak ? Let her go ! She knows nothing . Hurry up , I 've never been very patient . Fuck you ! You talk if you don 't want her burned alive ! I 'm feeling well in this place . This automat is temporarily out of order . Come on , talk ! We are young , we look the same , aren 't we ? What is Liberty ? It 's outdated . It 's for old people . Why suffer for it ? Why ? Fuck you ! No easy task to make mince meat talk . Tell me what to do then . You got to find your style . Above all with the ballsy guys . Like this one . Scram . Scram . She 's here and we 'll find her . Don 't worry . You allright ? I 'm going to help you . We don 't need you anymore . I give your life back . You can go . You didn 't talk . It 's nice .

Let 's finish this before we get to the land . Shit ! Shit ! Damned ! We don 't go to the land ! I 've got bad memories from this kind of place . Don 't forget . We need her alive ! Start the engine , old man ! Get out ! Get out ! Push it ! Push it ! Push it ! Come on , it 's allright ! Put your hands here . Yes , like this . What are you seeing ? Blood . And you ? You don 't remember ? If I were you I wouldn 't stay here . No . Don 't touch nothing when inside the land . Don 't move ! To put a mine inside a car . He gets creative . He fought a war or two . Just like me . Engine humming ! It feels good , doesn 't it ? It cheers you up ! What 's happening in the city ? They 've lost their business sense ? Yes . For a whore who opened her mouth . Why ? - They killed my friend . - And then ? They put me in jail . The witness . They didn 't want me to testify . She doesn 't understand , Mr. Judge . I will translate . There 's no cause worthy of martyrdom . Tell me you agree with me . But I refused . Then they killed all the people helping me . And now it 's your turn . It 's been that way since I was born . My place . When I got in here I had trouble . I started a new life . You could do better with my help . I 've been told that a lot in my life . You must learn to close the door . It 's my turn ! And move ! Give me some room , fat ass ! Wake up , the " coffins " ! Two of white hand . Come here , Toby . Sit down , my darling . From now on , you 're only a big eye seeing all . After this game your pockets will be left empty . You can take it all ! I 'm screwed ! Amadeus has lost again . I need you . Amadeus ! You wanted to betray me another time . Go on then . I was right to fold . I didn 't forget you , darling . Girls like you can 't wear rags . This should make you look good . Come here , my darling . And me ? Look at my face . Destroyed . Here . In Istanbul . Here , you see ? Henri 's work . And here . I won 't talk about it . I forgot . Watch here . Here ! Pierre Tonnerre aka Diesel ! He was really scary ! But he turned up as a good guy in the end . It 's easy with someone like me . You will see . Come on , baby . Come on , it 's over . Hey ! Wait for us . He 's living here , Diesel ? In his own way , yes . He 's gone most of the time . But now he comes back more often . Come and see inside Diesel 's belly . He arrived here one day ... Wounds everywhere . He was back from war . A war abroad , in hell maybe ... I healed his body . But for the rest ... He 's not easy to understand . You got to leave . Here is not a place for you . OK . I don 't care . What 's up with you ? You found your kennel here . I understand . I won 't bother you . - Why are you so tense ? What 's wrong with you ? - You want to know what 's wrong with me . Take this ! I finally found a roof and felt better and now you chase me out . Who chases you ? Who said that ? You think I was going to let you go alone . You 're mad . - It 's true ? You would leave with me ? - It 's what I wish . True . Exact . Agreed . You will help me . ( Inaudible ) ( Inaudible ) And my reputation ! Finally ! Hurrah for the electrons ! That 's my way of handling opposite forces . I would like everybody dies . Me included . I 'm fed up with driving around in this shithole of a land . That 's it ! He 's spotted . We have him now . Maybe I will be needing you . You have something ? You receive a signal ? There , it 's him . Pass him up but take care . Slowly now . Yeah . Go on , pass him up . There , you can pass him up . Help us , we 're lost . Can you stop here ? Stop there too . Go on , block his way , stop in front of him . Nice truck . - Nice night . - Not too much fog . There 's never too much fog around here . Good tires . Happy then ? - Not too much , in fact . - How do you like Anna ? It 's one of our girls . It 's not any girl . I 've noticed . She 's crazy . She ran as soon as I got to her . Do you think we 're that dumb ? This one is for the booby-trapped car . This one for the chase in the land . This one is on me . We know each other , don 't we ? We wouldn 't have been afraid together ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't be too smart with me ! So , you feel better now ? You can talk ? Where is she ? What 's your name ? - Nelson . - Never heard of . Go away . You too . We certainly know each other . Shit , this guy bores me . And I don 't like shadows from the past . This creep is going to run over us . Go , speed up ! Speed up , old man , speed up ! What 's that ? Nelson . Nelson . You were a better man before . You 're lucky I liked you well then . What are you thinking about ? I 'm pleased enough with myself . " It looks good on you , Anna . I found this over there . " No , it won 't work . " I bought it from a guy passing by . " It 's better . " I wanted to make a gift to you but we can 't buy nothing . I 've made it myself for you because because I like to make things up . " " Because you want to fuck with me , it 's the only thing on your mind ! " " No , surely not , it 's not about that ! It 's because I find you more beautiful than you think you are . " This is bloody idiot ! " I 'm offering it because I want to share . " That 's it . Yeah , yeah , yeah ... that smell ... I remember now ... He was on his knees , wounded . His guts out of his belly . You 're talking about that truck driver bastard ? I thought he was dead . - I can 't imagine you having memories . - What a bloody fool ! I wanted this job for the same reasons everyone wants it . The doe . Look inside . Look inside ! Look inside the barrel ! When you can look inside it you will have the right to talk to me . Walter , you 're listening ? Hi , Ziegler . Faithful friend . - We 're staying at Amadeus ' , Walter . - Amadeus ? What are you doing with this bastard ? Did you forget that he betrayed us ? He didn 't betray , he made the choice ... of going out and living in the land . That 's all . - What are you trying to tell ? You 're also betraying me ? I 'm your friend , Walter . Why would I betray you ? - Bring back the girl at once then ! We 're looking for her . And it 's not an easy task , believe me . All is rotten here . Even I , I 'm rotting up on my feet . Bring back the girl at once , Ziegler , or you won 't have enough time to rot . I 'm happy to meet you again . My past business with Walter , you remember about it ? I 'm stinking ' ! Take a bath . I need to remember who I am . I need to be filthy . I was so afraid . They could have made me eat my shit if they wanted to ! Nelson and Remi . How could you let it happen ? Aren 't you ashamed ? - About what , Bobo ? - In our contract we sell our ass , not our fiends . - And that girl . - Astrid . - And Karl . And all the Liberty people . - How do you know that , Bobo ? How do you know that ? - And soon it will be my turn . - Finch must know about it then . Don 't you think he knows ? So Roger is going to die . Because Finch will kill him ! Where is Anna ? Where is Anna ? Where is she ? - You 're sulking ? - Leave me alone . Even a piranha can 't be bothered all day long . I 've had nightmares and a bad night . I 'm achin ' everywhere . Is that enough ? And I 'm afraid that you leave . Where could I go ? There 's nothing around here . Well ... - There 's you and Diesel . - I 'm not really a sunshine . You were ambitious in your time . Like me . You 've lived in Istanbul . And now you 're here . You 're quiet here . Well ... That 's a way to put it . Of course you 're quiet here . I 've traveled a little too . I even had class then . I slept with the boss . I had panties so expensive they were transparent . And now I 'm here . For how long ? I will never sign another contract with anyone . We have to leave . Unfortunately I know Nelson . I 'm fed up with running away . Trust me . My Roger is dead . My Roger is dead . It 's really the end of our Mecca . Walter is tearing the Building organisation apart . I can 't control the girls anymore . And then ? I 'm afraid we 'll never be able to make them work . I know . It 's too late to think over it now . I didn 't like the initiatives you took . I counted on you to end definitively the Spiriteon case . You wanted that too , didn 't you ? - I did what was best for our interest . - Is that so ? Then we 're going to check the results immediately at the Building . Walter ... How can you give such a poor image of yourself ? It saddens me . It saddens me to see you so low because of your brother . You can stay alive . But you 've got to leave . I want you to leave the Building at once . Understood ? Understood , Walter ? You killed my brother . In such a way ... The used a iron wire . His flesh ripped apart . His tongue felt out of his mouth . His eyes exploded . And he let the rest fall in his pants . You 're a real nuisance , Walter . Kim will be your replacement . I don 't like the nutcase of your kind . Go away or you will really die . Kim ! It 's the last time you 're betraying someone . You killed him ! You killed him ! Hurry up . It 's our big day ! Wake up , old man . Wake up ! Who 's the owner of the truck with the crane ? Who 's this guy ? Who does he drink with ? Who does he fuck with ? - I know no-one around here . - Be careful I really have no interest in hiding things from you . You allright ? I 'm running while you 're relaxing ! - What are you waiting for ? - I just have to start the engine . I 'd like to come with you . But it 's not possible . - " Eat drink " is poor Mickey 's burden . - There she goes again ! Is that so ? - Who 's speaking ? - Diesel ! - Amadeus ! - I 'm in sector 17 . What are you doing there ? It 's not your road . - I have a problem with the truck . I 'm stuck in a ditch . - Can 't you manage to do it alone ? I wouldn 't call if I could , Diesel . What 's next ? Amadeus needs my help . Let 's go . Nobody moves ! When I think that you will be held prisoner during four years by Walter to be given as a gift to his brother ... We 've killed six people for you ... We 're really dumb . What 's that ? Diesel gave it to you ? A lucky charm ? You think it will work on you ? It 's too late now . Everybody left , old man . Someone here ? I can almost feel them . It looks like the Building ran out of business . Finished with Walter ! Leave me alone ! It 's your fault . You should have talk to me . That day , I thought you were dead . Otherwise I wouldn 't have left you behind . I 'm so dumb ! Camera 3 . Monitor 2 . Sound channel opened . Frankly , I 'm nervous about leaving them so quiet . Are you ready , dad ? For the moment , their small victory is insignificant . But already there are rumours , people talk . The Liberty word is whispered . It might be regretful to let an urban legend have its way . And very dangerous for our dictatorship . We 're forced to let them live their pitiful lives . Cut . - I was good ? - Very good , dad . Send it to my associates .

Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! don 't tell me that ! goose " something . You should feel flattered . El and I invented the damn thing . Don 't you think that they should show us the test results ? it 's not up to me . this second . It 's just simply not up to me . Then who is it " simply up to " ? They won 't tell me . Billy ! Billy ! you wanna hear something incredibly far out ? okay ? Oh . but it 's touchy . Touchy . - Leonard Sprocks . Says he only gets like this during mating season . Better watch his hands . this 'll just take a second . - It 's okay . They 're gone . ( Everybody talking at once ) Dick : Four labs in the east building have already called to complain about electrical problems . Richard ? you think we got B-Man down here for testing or something . B-Man . guys . Can we get the test results back on the human fly now ? a week . C 'mon . Nice shot . fourteen Stetmeyer 's - Billy : Alright . You guys blew it when you showed him the swatter . Tech : Dr. Hayes . We 're not getting a reading . it doesn 't work . he 's got to go . - Billy : He 's got a little smoke . See the smoke ? - El : It 's our landlord . He said he looked under the mat and the check wasn 't there . you tell ' im I looked in the bathroom and the plumber wasn 't there . Okay ? take the phone . I 'm tired of talking to him . I 've gotta talk to you . man . Tech : Dr. Hayes . Dr. Hayes . Will you come back here ? okay ? I just don 't have the — Richard . Can you just ... ? - Dick : Oh . Excuse me . Excuse me . I 've been listening to him for the last twenty minutes . Richard can 't give us our test results because of that " goose " something project . It 's classified . I 've already made myself perfectly clear . If it were up to me — just take the phone . We 're talking about something of major significance here ! Okay . Harry . You got the floor . What is it ? Dinner . Excuse me ? I — I got something really far out I wa — I wanna show you guys i-if he wants to — Can come over to my house for dinner tomorrow night . we got — Tomorrow ? uh — I checked it out with Gloria and Jane – it 's cool with them . look . Um ... We 'd really like to – we 'd love to – it 's gonna be impossible . thing on our — On our — our new experiment . I-I just — Some other time would be great . right now . it 'll — it 'll keep . It 'll keep . Next time . Huh ? yeah . It 'll — it 'll keep . We 'll do it next time . okay ? babe ? Thanks . Alright . Now what seems to be the problem here ? it 's unconstitutional when the government classifies your own work . sir . babe . We threw away how many Transicon units before we got one that worked ? Four . three or four ? Something like that . I mean — What if they get a hold of one that 's got bugs in it ? Huh ? I 'm telling you – trust me on this – this whole secrecy business is gonna pull a major boomerang on these guys . I 'm telling ya . she put pickles on my burger ! mayonnaise . Mayonnaise She 's definitely upset . I just have a minute . Glo ? would it ? He called me to cancel I don 't see how you guys could treat him like that . too – we really do – you know ? right ? Right . And there 's only so much Janis Joplin and outer space and robots you can talk about before you just have to draw the line . Has he ever invited you to dinner before ? Do you have any idea what he had to put himself through just to ask ? would you ? Cause you think you 're too good for ' im . I 'm really disappointed in you . You think he 'll be serving brown rice ? huh ? Had a real ' earthy ' taste . it 's one of my dad 's greater inventions : gritty hamburgers . huh ? have you ? look I just feel a little uncomfortable . Okay ? Billy and I have a relationship . Sort of . okay ? You should probably say something to him before he figures it out himself . I tell you what : I 'll tell him . No you won 't . I 'll tell him . When ? At my earliest convenience . When ? Not today . that 's her third burger . Dr. Hayes . I 'll try to remember that . I 'm serious . Is she looking a little Cabbage Patch to you these days ? Fabulous . I know . Get ready for Eugene . my name is Eugene McCarthy . Would you like some coffee ? No thanks . I 'm middle of the road these days . and — don 't bet on it . I 'm — I 've got something very big . uh ... o-off a satellite . And finally – uh ... I contacted extraterrestrials . Did — did he say ... ? Martians . Aliens . Mars . I-I don 't know how far . Okay ! Um ... Harry . I had a cousin whose friends lived on the next farm and they saw flying saucers . Harry ? but — Right . Okay . I guess I better show you . C-c 'mon . Hello out there . This is Harry . Planet Earth . wait — wait a min — wait a minute . Harry . Hello out there . This is Harry . Planet - " ? Harry ? You need a Transicon unit . I-I-I-I got one . One of the busted ones you guys threw out . All it needed was a couple circuits . boosting the F-ROM . Harry . Planet Earth . What 's a " Transicon " ? The Transicon unit is a device we developed — — that translates computer input from one language or set of codes to another . man to machine ... Madonna to Mantovani . Stetmeyer said they 're using it on a goose . I can 't believe you guys are buying into this stuff . the Misfits wouldn 't be here . Hello out there . This is Harry ! Agent : We 're getting a signal in the neighborhood . We 're trying to home in now . Planet Earth ! okay . I know what you guys are thinking . cloud cover 's interfering with my signal . man . Clouds are not a problem . it could be electrical interference above the clouds . Electrical ... Interference . no problem . I tell ya what : You talk to ' em in here and I 'll go outside and I 'll wave to ' em as they fly by . I have to go to the bathroom . Again ? Hello out there ! This is Harry ! Planet Earth ! I was takin ' a bath . On about a Saturday night . I was sittin ' in a tub . Thinkin ' everything was alright . That 's a stupid song . Sixties . It 's fifties . But who 's countin ' ? how ya doin ' ? How would you be doing if your father was in there talkin ' to Martians ? Why are you on his case all the time ? It seems to me he 's a pretty major league guy . We used to be real tight when I was a kid . I used to work in the garage with him and invent things . but when you grow up ... Then you 're s 'posed to stop dreaming ? it depends on who 's paying for those dreams . He 's got an IQ of a hundred and ninety zillion and he 's still washing test tubes at a lab . you know ? He doesn 't care about his job . He doesn 't care about money . He just cares about what 's in that garage . What ? And you think he doesn 't care about you ? he 'd do a lot less dreaming . This is a major bummer . I feel terrible . This is all just to get us up here to dinner . Jude ! Josh ! I got ' em again ! That 's binary code . It 's the language of the universe . The song of the stars . Harry : Star system confirmed . Billy ! This isn 't a trick . Or some fancy software . This is happening . This is real . but this ... This is incredible Hold on . We 're getting some contact now . Wait a minute . We gotta find a way to confirm this okay ? I mean — We gotta find a way to prove it . man ? Ask ' em to send a postcard ? and come over to the lab You got it . Invitation to dinner . Define dinner . Uh ... Feast and celebration . Accept ... very pleased . Send coordinates . - Send coordinates . Accept " ? Did they say " accept " ? El : This is great ! Great ! Alright ! He did it ! He did ! he got ' em ! They 're talking to the aliens ! You really think he could be onto something ? Do I look like an expert ? What do you think ? I think I 've been down this road before . but the signal is strong and steady . we 've made contact . Do you copy ? This is mother Goose We 've acknowledge contact Contact Confirmed . Will be sending in support Billy : There 's no way . There 's just no way he could 've made this stuff up . look at these orbit parameters . Look at this . Billy . I think he 's really done it . They told me this was going on a-and I didn 't believe ' em . I-I-I said to myself : " How — how could they be doing this to me ? They know about my ulcer . Do you realize what the board would do if it found out about this ? Humanidyne scientists fooling around with flying saucers . Stop it . No ! the pursuit of extraterrestrial life is a perfectly legitimate scientific concern . gimme a break . It 's not lunchtime ! are — Richard . Are you asking us to turn our backs on this ? we could be on the verge of — Losing the last shred of respectability left you . we 're talkin ' frontiers here . We 're talkin ' major breakthroughs . We 're talkin to " go where no man has ever gone before " . We 're talking about a lab technician with a personal computer and a homemade radio pulsar accomplishing the most distant space flights and the most sophisticated research programs in the world have been unable to do . Think about that . I know . It 's like Harry said . It 's ... far out . It 's absurd . And I 'm not going to have Humanidyne implicated . I don 't wanna see you in this computer room anymore . at all . Period . you 're a man with a point of view . And I tell you something : we respect that . We really do thank you . dudes ! Check it out ! Your old man really must be in trouble now . 'E.T. ' ? Is Captain Kirk under siege by the Klingons ? Bobby . Why not keep it to yourself ? who 's gonna make me ? alright ? let 's get outta here . It came in this morning . Coordinates unacceptable . Cannot land in a populated area . huh ? exactly what coordinates did you give ' em ? My house . Your house ? ! you know how he is about these dinner invitations . Josh 'd never go out to see them . So I figured if I brought ' em to my house ... Harry . Look . All we have to do is send up some new coordinates that are isolated . the meadow out at Garden Grove ? Guys ? I think we better fire up the truck . okay ? we 're probably blowing this thing way out of proportion . we might be playing this down a little . who do you think they are ? the government has a UFO program . Very secret . They investigate sightings and — And put a lid on everything they find . Right . they do this to us all the time . Harry ! Yeah . but I don 't I-I know what you 're thinkin ' . I-I just can 't allow it . this could get very heavy here . jeopardize your careers and what you 're workin ' on . no . Harry . - Wha — wha — what ? I don 't think you understand what I 'm trying to say — Bill . Listen You guys ... You guys have done enough for me already and I re — I really appreciate it . do on my own . I want you to go over to Andrea 's house . Jessica and your mother 's there . I 'm not a kid anymore . It 's not fair . It 's just not fair . I don 't understand . and they wanna take it away from ' im . okay ? But he 's one of us . Sort of . Are we just gonna let ' im ... go it alone . fearing a lot of evil and — Are we just gonna st - No ! That was easy . Harry ? uh ... So we 'd like to stick with ya . And help you meet those aliens up at Garden Grove . Our only problem is the goons . we could use a little help . but I think it could work . Um ... can you drive ? are you crazy ? Letting this young adult drive is like letting — Jane . Okay ? A little psychology . you 're on . But you gotta wait till you see my signal . Alright ? Alright . Hmm ? Yes ? There 's no way to get around him without being seen . Glo : We gotta have a distraction . El : Maybe we should offer him a cup of coffee . Glo : What ? Harry : What d 'you mean by that ? That 's too heavy for me . sit ! fella ? come on . my name is Eugene McCarthy . Would you like some coffee ? Hold it right there ! Hey . Got a minute ? sir . or something ? huh ? Yeah . Sir ? uh — and — wise guy . That 's the signal ! Hit it ! No ! Not yet . Whoa ho ! kid . Harry . Hurry ! Harry : Okay . I only got a couple more things . Can you hold ' em ? Glo : Yeah . Harry : Just get the monitor . Just the monitor Okay . That 's it . Hi guys . You 're cute when you 're angry . what — what a day . hit the door ! Hayes . Thank you . Where 's El ? B-Man . I 'll catch up with ya at Garden Grove . Sargent : Go after ' em ! Officer : Ice cream truck 's in the way . No key . that 's a good puppy . Good dog . bad dog ! Get outta here ! that was close . You 're tellin ' me . Hold it ! Oh ... Dog . Get your hands up . cover yourself . okay ? I 'd really like an explanation . How does treason sound to ya ? Officer : This is Alpha Unit Four to Mother Goose . We have two of the bogeys . This is Mother Goose . Officer : The others got away . Okey doke . Set up the search net . And bring in the two ya got . Roger . Does this guy have any idea what the hell he 's locked himself into ? and counting . okay ? They can 't hang ya for talkin ' to aliens . He said ' treason ' . Mother Goose . Billy . This is no time for nursery rhymes . wait a minute . What was the name of that classified project they 're using our Transicon unit on ? Goose " something . This is Alpha Unit Four to Mother . We 're bringing ' em in . this is Mother . We copy . What 's your current twenty ? We 're about eleven minutes from home . you gotta shrink again . I can 't . There hasn 't been enough time . dammit . We gotta find out what 's going on here . And this is really uncomfortable . I 'm honored to welcome you to our planet — No ! That 's too uptight . What would Captain Kirk say ? Scotty . Harry . You 'll make ' em feel right at home . This is a very far out thing that is happening to me . I never told anybody . I always knew this was gonna happen . It 's — it 's like my karma . I 've just hung onto the dream ... and it 's all come round . Ya — ya gotta hang onto the dreams . that 's all . too . So are you . Everybody that 's worth the trouble 's a little weird . I know . It 's just amazing . my father being be the first guy in the world to talk to aliens . That 's super weird . Did you call ' em ? Are you kidding ? Do you think I like being humiliated in front of my friends ? I want this bird up and that means we gotta get people out of our hair . and counting . You the lunatic that 's talkin ' to Martians ? Uh ... boy . Good for you . they 're puttin ' up roadblocks all over town . Tryin ' to keep us from seein ' this . They think you 're a spy . you be polite . Mind your manners with ' em . We 'll be watching . Jane 's looking like a blonde Shamu . maybe it 's stress . You know ? Some people eat when they have a problem . long time 'Til touch down brings me round again to find I 'm not the man they think I am at home Oh no no no I 'm a rocket man burning up my fuse up here alone I 'm a rocket man burning up my fuse up here alone long time 'Til touch down brings me round again to find I 'm not the man they think I am at home Oh no no no I 'm a rocket man Rocket man Burning out his fuse up here alone Billy .

Can you get up a little ? if she had bad breath we 'd say something . it 's up to us — she 's fine . she 's fat . She 's pregnant . What ? ! Boo ! Billy ! El : Now what ? There 's nothing here but corn . you know ? You wanna tell me what 's goin ' on here ? Just growing sorghum . and counting . The van just arrived with the two clipped pigeons . We 're still gettin ' interference . Countdown remains conditional until we get ' em all . but the kids never have . Figured this 'd be a good opportunity for ' em . honey . I 'm so proud of you . I don 't buy it . we 'd both know about it . I do know . I — I think you 'll find you 're guessing ' . El . um ... Why would she tell you and not me ? Huh ? we got a problem here . they didn 't haul us up here for a corn roast . it 's gotta be — Underground . Officer : Halt ! Where are we going ? How should I know ? You think I can see ? Billy : El ! Escape hatch ? Worth a try . whose baby is it anyway ? Billy . I 'll find out ! You better tell me now ! alright . Her husband . Whoa ! Her what ? ! Her husband . Come on ! Her hu — all this time she 's been married all this time and she wouldn 't go out with us cause she was married ? Billy . Separated ? Separated from what ? Her husband ! Come on ! Her husband ?

Mother Goose . and counting . this is not my idea of a fairy tale Gaurd : Put your hands in the air ! Harry ? holding . holding . The bird in that silo is a top-secret orbiting delivery system for nuclear warheads and you 're tellin ' me he 's able to do this because he has another one of your Transicon units ? It was supposed to be one-of-a-kind . Why didn 't you tell us about it ? You see what happens when you go to private contractors . Mr. Classified Goose . we might 've been talking to you . we didn 't know we were giving directions to a damn ballistic missile ! Billy . Look . Harry salvaged a non-working unit out of the garbage . And he got it workin ' again ? but he 's modified it and he 's boosted it so that it 's three or four times as powerful as yours . It looks like we all underestimated Harry . Desire rendezvous now . Instructions ? seven . Must be coming from a mother ship . it 's gonna land smack dab in the middle of Garden Grove . seven . Garden Grove Meadow . That 's affirmative . We don 't resume countdown until he 's in custody . Countdown resuming on its own ! Jeffries ! Shut her down . Officer ; It 's not responding ! Harry . Launch sequence set . Coordinates locked and set ! Alright ! Break out the good dishes . Alright ! Oh ... Oh my god . Announcer : Mother goose has reached stable orbit . She 's in stable orbit now . Goose : Can you get her to respond ? but it 's negative . She 's on her own . Damn Announcer : Coordinates fixed and locked . Coordinates fixed and locked . Isn 't this exciting ? Jane . You were talking to me about — about Mark . Look . Maybe it wasn 't as bad as I said it was . It 's just that ... sometimes I felt like I ranked somewhere between his racquetball and waxing the Beamer We split up . It 's not such a bad going-away present . It 's the best thing he ever did . Jude . they 're coming . Jessica . here it is ! That 's no spaceship . That 's a helicopter . Please clear the area . Clear the area at once . Please clear the area . no . there it is ! right on time ! There ! take the perimeter ! Give me a hand ! you 're just in time . listen to me . man it 's a missile . Oh . I 'm sorry . Harry .

Thinka one . please clear the area . There are no aliens . ya gotta turn it . Talk to it ! You-you can 't talk to a missile once it re-enters . I-I don 't have the equipment . any ideas ? It depends on his last transmission Soup 's on . " Soup 's on " ? I don 't know . The translator will trace back through its transformational codes . I 'd stick to food codes for sure . Billy : Cancel dinner ! Harry . Billy : Cancel dinner . Dinner cancelled . not cancel . Dinner moved . Uh ... I don 't have enough boost without the satellite dish . I-I don 't have the antenna power I need . Get those people outta here ! Come on ! Bill . Wait . Wait a minute . I got it ! you see the earthmover ? so ? Billy : The Lewis Effect . El : Of course ! The false magnetic field . If we can get Johnny B to store up an electrical storm in it ... We can create a gigantic electromagnetic antenna and ... And if I beam my pulse at the antenna ... It 'll work . It 'll work ? You 're gonna turn the tractor into an antenna ? I don 't think so . Harry . I gotta go back . Here . man . I don 't know . He once put a motor on my rollerskates . and it didn 't work . Your old man 's never done anything right and he never will . Bobby . Stay outta my face . Or what ? Josh ? You can 't go down there . You can 't go down there ! - My father 's down there . It 's a missile ! Billy . Jane . huh ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I should 've said something . too . No more fat jokes ? huh ? Hey . Dad ! Dad . Josh ! It 's not a spaceship . I know . What can I do ? Pulser 's floating . I-I Can 't Get antenna power . I 've really screwed up . I can run the pulser . You got it . Five twenty seven . you gotta electrify that thing . You gotta get a current running through it . Now can you handle that much juice ? Seems like a good time to find out . Johnny B ! just think about this befor — Go . Harry . Send it now . Moving dinner . Harry : Send new coordinates . Tell it two degrees north . Six hundred and twenty million dollars into the side of the mountain . am I ? Harry . Send it again . Send it again . Send it again . New coordinates accepted . Alright ! He 's okay . I 'm sure he 's okay . you did your best . And that 's what counts . but it was a pretty good show . I just — I really don 't know what to say . Harry . You don 't have to say anything . I do . If it hadn 't been for you guys ... I thought I was really up the river . But Jeffries said that I uncovered some serious security flaw in his system and he 's offered me a job . what a cosmic shift this is . um ... for some reason ... Uh ... He seemed to want to move you up to full research scientist and give you your own lab in another building . Welcome aboard . Far out ! Alright ! How 'd you do that ? We 'll talk about it later . wait . You didn 't tell Stetmeyer that we were gonna do that toxic waste program ? Not exactly . what does that mean ? I hate that . " Not exactly " . El . It means that 's not exactly the position . kid . - Alright . maybe . It 's a good thing . It works . El : Billy . Toxic waste is Toxic Waste ! It 's disgusting Billy ! Harry : Music . too 80 's . Heard it through the grapevine Not much longer would you be mine I heard it through the grapevine And I 'm just about to lose my mind yeah I must say When I found out yesterday yeah Heard it through the grapevine Not much longer would you be mine I heard it through the grapevine And I 'm just about to lose my mind yeah ( Heard it through the grapevine Not much longer would you be my baby ) Heard it through the grapevine Harry : I don 't believe it Harry : I don 't believe it . Dad ? Harry : They 're talking to us again ! New coordinates received . seven hundred and twenty-six ... Earth years . Josh ! Maybe we just better keep this to ourselves . straight from the heart Class Assignment oh no no Science is over Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies .

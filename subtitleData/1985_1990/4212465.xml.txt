All of which were made from the ashes of the volcano ... Did you get a piece of ash ? of course nobody 's going to sell her a spare tire ... after what we just told them happened to us .

And she was trying to convince them I wasn 't a bad driver ... which I 'm not . she was doing it by telling them how thin the road is . and how curvy and how many rocks there were ... and how big and sharp they are . And all the time I know what these people are thinking . They gotta drive down the same road ... sir ? Sir ? my goodness gracious ! can it ?

 ( PHONE RINGS ) ( PHONE ANSWERED ) MAN : Good evening , ARC Aerospace . No , ma 'am , he 's gone for the day . ( CHIMP GIBBERING ) WOMAN : He 's never been trained . But watch what happens when I give him a command . Any requests ? Make him clap his hands . Stick out his tongue . Cross his arms . Well , I 'll be a monkey 's uncle . With this keyboard , we can virtually control his every movement . But that 's not all . We 've put in a little something extra , - an automatic defense program . - ( CHIMP SHRIEKING ) MAN : He just looks scared shitless to me . WOMAN : He is . He 's trapped . Watch what happens when the robot touches him . ( CHIMP SHRIEKING ) ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) MAN : Wow . WOMAN : He 's hooked up to my rage response activator . It switches on automatically whenever the monkey 's hide is touched by anything or anyone . ( BEEPING ACCELERATING ) My God , his heart rate . His brainwaves are going right through the ceiling . Can you shut it off ? Yeah , I can with this remote keyboard . But I don 't have to . Watch . ( BEEPING SLOWS ) Once the threat has been destroyed , the rage response activator shuts off automatically and Supermonkey turns back into mild-mannered Clark Kent . Is that all the juice we can get out of that rage thing ? Seems to have done the job . Let 's see what happens when he 's really provoked . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( CHIMP SHRIEKING LOUDLY ) ( BEEPING ACCELERATING ) ( ALARM SIGNAL BEEPING ) I 'm going to deactivate it . No , Gail , leave it alone . I want to see how far this thing will go . Whyte , we 're going terminal here . ( BEEPING STOPS ) ( PRIMATES CHATTERING ) Well , Gail , you 've got a lot more work to do . Come on , come on . Get to it . LAUREN : Carl , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong is Alex Whyte . He cut my budget again without any explanation . And he took three of my prototype chips before I had the chance to test them . And every time I try to talk to him about it , he avoids me or he comes up with some kind of stupid excuse . I don 't know what 's wrong with that man . You know , any lab in the country would be happy to have you . Yeah , well , I 'm going in there tomorrow morning and I 'm not gonna take no for an answer . Good . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey . ( PATS HER STOMACH ) - How are we doing ? - Fine . Yeah ? You wanna try for twins ? Yeah . MAN : ( ON RADIO ) What the fuck you doing down there ? You 're supposed to be at Young and Leonard Street for the airport pick up . And 742 , your wife called . Pick up a quart of milk on the way home , and don 't dilly-dally . - You know what ? - What ? - I think it 's time to fix that ground wire . - I think you 're right . WOMAN : ( OVER P.A. ) Dr. Whitman , call 24 , please . Dr. Whitman , 24 . - So how do we handle it ? - I want to talk to you , Alex . - Shit . - Alex , I tried to stop him . I 'll call security . Hey , it 's okay , Scott . Security is for spies . Carl 's on our side , remember ? - It 's okay . - Yes , sir . Well , sometimes she takes me a little too literally . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to trade her in for a newer model . I want some answers , Alex , or I 'm gonna blow the whistle on you . In the last two months $ 1.6 million has been slashed from my silicon project . Alex , I 'm that close to finishing . I need that money . Now , something 's going on here , and you 're deliberately keeping me in the dark about it , and I don 't like that . That money 's being used for research that will revolutionize science . Cut the bullshit , Alex . I 've heard all this before . I don 't trust you . Now you 're gonna tell me everything that 's going on right now or I 'm gonna bust this thing wide open . Less than two days . Just give me two days and I 'll tell you everything we got . You 're gonna be very excited about what 's going on here and you 're gonna be a big part of it . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'll be back in two days . MASSEY : Think it 's time , Alex ? Hmm . Morning . - ( CLEARS THROAT ) - Oh ! Morning , Burt . You got me . I 'm impressed . You 're gonna be a daddy . Yay ! Congratulations . Lauren told me . - Thanks , Burt . It feels great . - Yeah . You gotta promise me one thing , though . If you ever get tired of your family , you 'll give them to me . Hey , they 're yours . I need a cup of coffee . - I 'll get it . It 's my turn . - No way . You shouldn 't be moving around too much . ( CHUCKLES ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) Hey , wake up out there . Something 's getting hot . ( ALARM BEEPING ) Hey , Belman , Simpson , you guys out there ? Come on ! ( ALARM BEEPING ) Open , God damn it ! Get me the hell out of here . Open the door , you asshole ! This whole fucking place is gonna blow ! ( ALARM BLARING ) No . No ! - ( CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING ) - WHYTE : Carl Lehman fearlessly walked into a time bomb that was rumbling and ready to explode . And he sacrificed his life so that others might live . Rest in peace , Carl . I 'm so sorry , Lauren . I 'm gonna miss Carl very much . He was a terrific scientist and he was a terrific friend . Bullshit . MASSEY : It looks pretty good so far . The vital functions are stable . GAIL : You mean , that thing 's alive ? MASSEY : Well , that would depend on your definition of the word " life . " We are preserving the brain in an oxygenating solution . I know about that . Some sort of a Japanese concoction , isn 't it ? That 's the stuff . White blood . Jesus , looks kind of creepy . What in the hell is it ? Looks a bit like you on a Monday morning , Simpson . Very funny . That 's a terrible way to talk about your old colleague , - Carl Lehman . - GAIL : What ? Carl Lehman ? What are you talking about , Carl Lehman ? What we have here is a perfect opportunity . I don 't know , Alex . This isn 't some animal . Yeah , but we 're ready . All of you have been working in your own specific fields and experiments , which , if combined , could recreate human life . A brain in a tank ? That 's not life . No , not a tank . Kessler 's Mars landing suit . A living human brain in an indestructible mechanical body . With tremendous strength , thanks to Simpson 's prosthetics . Well ? Let 's go for it . Right . Gail ? I cannot emphasize enough the need for secrecy . Therefore , from now on our experiment will be known as Project Frankenstein . BURT : Are you sure you want to stay here , Lauren ? LAUREN : I 'll be okay . Catherine 's gonna stay with me for a few days . I 'm just really glad that you were there . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Burt . ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God . Oh , Burt , look . This is exactly what I goddamn needed . Inconsiderate animals ! My God , Burt ! Oh , Carl . You knew we were gonna have a baby and you should have thought of that , Carl . You should have thought of us ! Better call the police . ( DOOR CREAKS ) ( SCREAMS ) Catherine , you scared the shit out of me . What the hell do you think you did to me ? You always greet people at the door like this , Burt ? MAN : Okay , tell him we got Lehman 's files and tore the place up to look like a burglary . GAIL : Data analysis functions on standby . KESSLER : Environmental check . SIMPSON : His body and organs are completely non-functional . But with the suit 's onboard computer , we can regulate the supply of oxygenating fluid to his brain . KESSLER : His eyes were untouched . Thank God he was wearing goggles . GAIL : We 're ready , Doctor . Everything checks out . I 'm going in . I 'm going to insert the first electrode into his brain . By connecting his brain to the computer , he will be able to control the movements of the suit . His thoughts will be translated into action by the program . Readout . 0.045 millimeters in grid A , 5 for the occipital lobe . Increase the wash rate . I said increase the wash rate . EEG is low normal . Can you pick it up , Massey ? Elapsed time one hour and 25 minutes . It 's done . ( SIGHS ) GAIL : We have a signal . His brain is communicating directly with the computer . ( IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT ) Well , Dr. Frankenstein , shall we turn him on ? Anytime , Igor . He 's autonomous . GAIL : I still don 't understand why you connected the rage response activator to the computer . If he senses any kind of threat , he could turn into an uncontrollable killer . No . As long as I have the remote , it will be my decision when to trigger the reaction . ( EEG TRACING ) What 's going on ? I don 't know . The signal 's not getting through to his brain . The computer program works . I 've checked it a hundred times . The suit is operational . Then why isn 't he working , huh ? Fuck . Gail , tear him apart . Break him down and find out what the hell went wrong . Maybe the next time you overpaid geniuses are handed a golden opportunity like this , you won 't fuck it up . KESSLER : ( IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT ) Yes , master . Should I look for another body , master ? Watch it , Kessler . It could be you . Shut up , the both of you . ( PRIMATES CHATTERING ) Okay , Carl . Let 's see where we screwed up . ( CRACKLING ) ( CHIMP SHRIEKING ) ( PRIMATES SHRIEKING ) Carl . Can you hear me ? You 've had an accident , Carl , but you 're all right . I just want to put the remote unit back in the suit . I promise you , you 'll feel a lot better once I get this back in you . ( SCREAMS ) GAIL : No . My God . - Go back ! - ( PRIMATES SHRIEKING ) ( ALARM SOUNDING ) Get off of me ! SECURITY : We 've got an alarm sounding in Dr. Vernon 's lab . Check it out . Come on , let 's go . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( PRIMATES SHRIEKING ) SECURITY : Oh , my God ! ( CHIMPS SHRIEKING ) ( SCREAMING ) Get it off ! Okay . Good night . Okay , that 's it . Let 's go . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ACCELERATING ) - CARL : No ! - ( ALARM BLARING ) This whole fucking place is gonna blow ! Open the door , you asshole ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) What the hell ? - Found him yet ? - No , sir . No , sir . But a guy in a spacesuit shouldn 't be too hard to find . And one thing I don 't understand , Mr. Whyte , is why he 'd wanna steal it in the first place . Who knows ? - Has there been any traffic in or out ? - No . Well , except for a garbage truck . Could he have gotten in the back of the truck ? Well , I doubt it . I mean , with the crusher and the chemicals , he 'd be dead by now . Keep looking . You see ? I told you he 'd work . I knew he 'd work . He works , he works . But Gail 's dead , and the fucking remote unit is still up in her lab . Christ ! How do we control him ? Sloppy . Very sloppy . What are we supposed to do now ? He 's not inside the building . It 's gotta be that garbage truck . All right , listen , we 've gotta find him fast . If someone touches him , anyone , his onboard computer will take over and he 'll kill . ( DISTORTED VOICES ) ( BURGLAR ALARM RINGING ) Hey , man . Look at that dude over there . Don 't he know these streets ain 't safe at night ? Hey , jerkoff , wait for us ! Hey , I 'm a little short on cash . Let 's go make a withdrawal . ( CHUCKLES ) Come out , come out , wherever you are . Yoo-hoo , where are you ? Hey , man , come on . Don 't be shy . ( CHUCKLES ) We just want to be friendly . I 'm getting a little tired of this hide-and-seek bullshit . Get your ass out here , turkey . There he is . I see him . Where do you think you 're going ? Holy shit , man ! Trick or fucking treat ? He looks like the Silver fucking Surfer , man . Yeah , after he ran into the Incredible Hulk . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , well , this jerkoff just went to his last costume party . ( GRUNTS ) ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( BEEPING ACCELERATES ) Hey ! ( GRUNTS ) What the hell ? Come on , you fucker ! Please . Hey , hey . Please , I didn 't do nothing . Please . I ... - ( CRUMPLING ) - ( SCREAMING ) ( BEEPING SLOWING DOWN ) ( BIKER GROANS ) Please , don 't hurt me no more . Let 's get out of here . My God ! Come on , Kessler , let 's go . He must still be around . How do we stop him ? Well , you made the goddamn suit ! Yeah , but it was supposed to land on fucking Mars , not in some Christ-forsaken alley ! MASSEY : We should never have used him for the experiment . We should have just finished him off the way we planned it . But you , you had to play God . Where the hell would he go ? Who knows ? Maybe he went home . ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) Catherine ? Catherine , are you awake ? ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) ELECTRONIC VOICE : Lauren ? Lauren ? Lauren ? Lauren ? Lauren ? Who are you ? What do you want ? It 's me , Carl . I 'm still alive . Lauren , find Burt . I need Burt . And tell him to be careful of Whyte . What should I tell Whyte ? No , don 't . Stay away from Whyte . He 's made me a killer . How do I know this isn 't a sick joke ? Please tell Burt . And don 't dilly-dally . Carl . I love you . All right , Alex , there is nothing to connect ARC to those kids . But just in case , I sent Brian down to The Herald to keep an eye on things . Okay , good . What about Chief Doherty ? Well , he 'll think it 's one of those street gang things . Alex , I just don 't understand . I don 't understand how Carl could have killed those kids . What made him do it ? - You son of a bitch ! What do you think ... - See , I attack you , you get angry , but your mind and your body respond on a rational level . You just touch Carl and he kills . But why ? His onboard computers perceive a threat , the rage response mechanism takes over and it removes the threat . Carl has no control over it . Your organic computer responds but your mind controls it . It 's like a safety valve . Carl 's safety valve is the remote unit and it 's unattached . Oh , my God ! Why , Alex ? Why would you take such a risk ? You have so much to lose . ( SIGHS ) Maybe , but I if can control him , there 's so much to gain . ( SIGHS ) - I think it 's time we brought in Hunter . - Not Hunter . WHYTE : I want Carl back , and Hunter is the only one I know who can do the job . You mind hurrying it up , Hunter ? I 'm getting a headache . ( CLAMORING ) ( GRUNTS ) Okay , Whyte . All done . Let 's go . Thank you for the lesson , Grandmaster Kwong . It 's gonna cost you more this time , Whyte . WHYTE : It already has . BOY : Enemy space vehicle spotted ! ( IMITATES EXPLOSION ) Patrol , this is Starfighter 1 . We 've damaged his reflectors . I 'm going to pursue . ( IMITATING SPACESHIP FIGHT ) We 're gonna throw everything at him ! Holy galaxies ! It 's a direct hit . I surrender , Starfighter . Please don 't hurt me . Who are you ? I 'm called Carl . Who are you ? Starfighter Bobby Wilson . Are you from outer space ? Um , yes . Do you know E.T. ? Um , sure . Oh , boy , I could show you where to hide ! Don 't come any closer ! I may be contaminated by the Earth 's atmosphere . You probably are . The air stinks down here . Follow me ! There 's this big pipe coming out of the ground . Uh-oh . They put a car in the way . Let me see what I can do . Move back . Wow ! Carl 's alive . I spoke to him , Burt . I wasn 't dreaming . Did you actually see him ? No . His voice came through the synthesizer . - The synthesizer ? - Burt , I know it sounds crazy . No , it doesn 't sound crazy . You 're just a little upset , that 's all . Yes , I 'm upset , but it was Carl 's voice ! Burt , I talked to him ! All right . Okay , okay , okay . Look , I 'm gonna show you something that might be very upsetting to you , but I think that you 've got to see it . ( ALARM BLARING ) Our security cameras recorded the whole thing . Do you want me to go on ? Yes . ( ALARM BEEPING ACCELERATES ) No ! ( EXPLOSION ) She 's not buying it . ( WOMAN CHANTING ) Catherine , what the hell are you doing ? Shh . - He 's back . - Who 's back , Catherine ? You will frighten his spirit . Stop it ! Damn it , Catherine . I asked you not to do this . That 's it . He 's gone . You 've scared him away . Nice going , Lauren . And I was so close . - I think I 'll go take a shower . - Cath . I spoke to Carl , not a ghost . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Maybe next time I 'll say a few words and give Catherine a thrill . Carl . I saw the accident today . It was horrible . What do you mean , you saw the accident ? Whyte had it on videotape at his office . You saw Whyte ? I had to . Burt didn 't believe me . Took me to Whyte 's office . I saw an autopsy report and a death certificate , both signed by Massey . - That 's him . - CARL : Massey , that bastard . It 's time I had a little talk with him . Carl . Carl ! Catherine , where are you ? Quick . They 're out there . CATHERINE : Where ? I don 't see anybody . I got some thinking to do . So , listen , why don 't you get lost ? Hey , come on . I waited all night for you here . I didn 't tell you to wait . MAN : Nobody 's back there . Massey got his stuff ? Take your stuff and get out . Well , fuck you . What are you , some kind of hooker ? No . I need cab fare . Yeah , well , I am not the goddamn bank , honey . So take a bus . You make me puke . You stupid shithead ! Bastard ! Let her go . She 's a lousy fuck anyway . ( GASPS ) Carl . So , you know who I am then , Ian ? I saved your life , Carl . - After the accident . You would have died . - No ! No , you killed me . I had to . Whyte was blackmailing me . How do I stop the killing , Massey ? How do I control it ? It 's the suit , Carl . It 's the suit . It 's the programming in the suit . Come with me . Come with me to ARC and I can help you . How am I supposed to believe you ? What the hell have you and Whyte done to me ? Stay away from me , Carl . Just tell me what I need to know . Don 't come any closer , Carl . Don 't come any closer . Don 't be a fool , Massey . ( SUIT BEEPING ) No , no ! Carl ! Carl , no ! - No , Carl , no ! I saved your life ! Carl , no ! - ( BEEPING ACCELERATING ) ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God . HUNTER : He 's down there somewhere . Get me a map of the sewer system . Where 's the witness ? It was horrible . And you were all alone ? It must have been just terrible . This is the only section of the sewer wide enough for a man to pass through . Okay , Wyman , you 're Able Unit . Richards , you 'll take Baker and I 'll head in through Charlie . Now , Kessler is gonna monitor the system on ultrasound . Okay , Kessler , tell them about the suit . The nutcase we 're after is wearing a spacesuit . It 's impervious to almost all outside penetration . These weapons were designed to release vaporized acid , which we hope will penetrate the seals of the armor . This is the weak spot . It 's where the life support umbilical was attached . ( BEEPING ) Hold it . Kessler , Wyman , Richards , this is Charlie Unit . Check in , guys . This is Able . We 're heading for central hookup . Charlie , this is Baker here . No sign of him yet . Kessler here . Good luck . Over . Come on , guys , let 's get this over with . ( WHISPERS ) Kill the lights . Freeze . Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . What the hell are you doing down here ? What the hell are you doing down here ? You 've got to have authorization . We have authorization , sweetheart , right here . Some of your fellow workers have been bitten by rats that we think might be rabid . Now I suggest you clear the area until we finish exterminating . Shit . I 'm out of here , lady . I 'm going . P.U. Anybody got any Ty-D-Bol ? We better be getting time and a half for this . Hey , George , find your goldfish yet ? Keep it down . Cut the lights . This is Able . Something 's moving . Lights out . We hear him . Shh . Stand by . - Now ! - Hit it ! Shit . Christ , let 's go back . Shit . ( MEN EX CLAIMING ) What the ... What the hell is going on over there ? ABLE : Half the fucking city just flushed their toilets . Shut the hell up . Kessler , have you got anything yet ? Negative . All right , Able , Baker , this is Charlie Unit . Pack your bags , we 're going home . All right , spaceman , let 's take it nice and easy . That 's it , spaceman . Take it nice and easy , nobody 'll get hurt . - Who are you ? - Fire . ( SUIT BEEPING ) - Gas ! - Keep firing . ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) ( SOBBING ) No , no . No ! No , no , no , no ! No ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIRENS SOUNDING ) Hey , where do you think you 're ... - ( GRUNTS ) - MAN : What the hell ? Will somebody stop her ? Hey ! That 's it ! There . Over there . We put out the word that Ian Massey and his little lovebird eloped to Rio on an extended honeymoon . Good . - And Hunter 's people ... - Mmm-hmm . ... they did a pretty good job - of cleaning up the place . - ( CHUCKLES ) ( WOMAN GASPS ) Who do you think you 're jerking around , Whyte ? Hello , Hunter . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's all right . Leave it alone . - Put the gun down , Hunter . - Screw you . I lost two of my best men . And your little friend Kessler is dead , with a manhole cover up his ass because you bullshitted me . Put the gun away . Put the gun away . What are you gonna do , shoot me ? Not until I know what 's going on . That was no nutcase in a spacesuit . I wanna know what the fuck you did to him . Well , I 'm not quite sure . We never really had a chance to test him out . Well , I wanna know everything you know or I 'm out . It operates by servo motors of significant yet undetermined strength . What do you mean , " undetermined strength " ? Well , we 're not quite sure . We could 've used a thicker bar , but we would 've had to build a stronger bench in order to anchor the mechanical arm . Well , congratulations . It looks like you guys have created one hell of a killing machine . And you made it virtually indestructible . A nice touch . Well , Hunter , I 've never seen you like this before . Something you 're afraid of ? Anyone in their right mind would be afraid of it . But inside that suit there 's a man , and I 've never , ever lost to a man . WOMAN : ( ON RADIO ) Excuse me , Captain Bringdown , but could you play something a little more cheerful , like The Death March ? LAUREN : Sorry , I don 't do requests . CATHERINE : Do you think they 're still out there ? They 're out there . Then why don 't we just put a stop to this nonsense and call the police ? No , I don 't want to jeopardize Carl . He knows he can find me here . ( SCRAMBLED VOICE ) - Do you hear something ? - No . I did . Back earlier . It sounds like a voice but playing at the wrong speed . With a baby about to be born , and Carl married to Lauren . They must avoid a family torn , so should meet at the church in the morn . MAN : The wife 's just turning south on Elm . I 'm following . I hope you 're in the mood for a nice , long , scenic drive . Don 't come any closer . Please . - Carl , I wanna see you . - No . No , it 's too dangerous . You don 't understand , I am not me . I have no control . They 've made me kill . Now , listen carefully . You 've got to get to Burt . Tell him to meet me tonight at the old ARC warehouse . Just do it , Lauren , and then leave the city immediately . I want you to get as far away as you can . Oh , my God . What 's happened to you ? Get away from me ! Please , Carl . God damn it , I 'm not Carl ! I don 't know who I am ! I 'm a machine ! I ... I can 't feel . I can 't touch . I 'm not human . I love you . You can 't . You can 't love this . - No , don 't touch me ! - ( SUIT BEEPING ) - Carl , I ... - No ! Carl ! Burt , you gotta go see him . I know you didn 't believe me before . But I 've seen him . He 's some kind of , um ... Like a corpse . - And he 's in some kind of weird metal suit . - Wait a minute . The guys at ARC are going nuts about some guy who stole a metallic space suit . That must be it . I 'm sorry , Lauren . Oh , Burt . Oh , Burt , thank God you believe me . Thank you . Thank you for being such a good friend . I love you . Carl ? ( BEEPING ) No offense , Burt , but I should have gone for the coffee . Oh , my God . You are alive , buddy . I need your help . I need some research data on Whyte 's secret project . You 'll have to break his private access code . You think you can do that ? Hey , I am the best code-buster in the business . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah . I think it was the 3,000 free games at Zaxxon that tipped me off . How you doing ? Hey , I 'm indestructible . Listen , whatever else happens , promise me you 'll look after Lauren . You know I 'd do anything for her . Thanks , friend . Oh , uh ... She gave me a letter . I know it 's dangerous for me to come too close , so I 'll just put it here on the floor , okay ? Sure . I knew I could count on you . But be careful , all right ? - You 're sure the resin 's set ? - Like a rock . All right , let 's see what we got here . Well , Whyte , one spaceman delivered as promised . - Okay . - Move him out . Well , that wasn 't too bad , was it ? I am just glad that this is all over . Well , not quite . There 's one loose end you have to clear up for me . What ? - Lauren Collins . - Yeah ? Get rid of her . You didn 't say anything about that . That was not part of the deal . This is the deal , Burt . You 're in this up to your ass . You like that shiny new job you got , huh ? - Yes , I like that job . - You want to keep it ? - Yeah . - Well , you do what you have to do . Yeah , okay . Oh , and , Burt , I wanna see you in my office , 9 : 00 tomorrow . You 're late again with your reports . Hey , I 've got a business to run around here , you know . ( MUFFLED BEEPING ) ( BEEPING ACCELERATING ) Hey , man , drive carefully . I don 't want to get pulled over by a cop . What 's happening ? Jesus . What 's going on ? What 's happening ? ( GRUNTS ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Look out ! Watch where you 're going ! - That 's pitiful . - No ! ( SCREAMS ) ( DOORBELL RINGING INSISTENTLY ) Oh , Burt ! - What happened ? - I need a drink . Did you see Carl ? Was he there ? Burt , what happened ? He 's dead . No . The suit failed , and he was almost dead when I got there . He asked me to take care of you . We got to get out of here . I know a place where we can go where they 'll never find us . And I 'll be a good father to your child . What are you talking about ? I love you . You 're lying to me . Where is he , Burt ? What happened to Carl ? Burt , I trusted you . What have you done to him ? You never really did care about me , did you ? I was in on this whole thing from the very beginning because I love you , I wanted you to be with me . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMING ) - No ! - Stop screaming . Stop screaming . If you scream , I might hurt you , and you 'll lose your baby . ( PANTING ) Carl isn 't dead . They 've taken him back to experiment on him . Get back ! Lauren , you wouldn 't shoot me . I would to save my child . Now just keep moving , Burt . Oh , fuck ! I 'm so sorry . Burt , what happened to Carl ? ( LAUREN GRUNTING ) ( BOTH GRUNT ) Stop it ! Don 't ! No , Burt , don 't ! ( LAUREN GRUNTING ) ( CHOKING ) Lauren ? Oh , hey , guys . Woop , woop , woop . No , really , uh , sorry . Wait a minute . What am I apologizing for ? If you want privacy , use the bedroom . ( WHISPERS ) Help me . ( YELLS ) ( CATHERINE CHOKING ) ( GRUNTS ) - Take that , you perverted animal ! - ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) Lauren , are you okay ? Come on . We gotta get out of here quick . Look , wait here . You stay here . I 'll go get the car . - ( THUD ) - ( CATHERINE GRUNTS ) - ( CRACKING SOUNDS ) - ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Nice , Burt . Neat , clean . Nobody will ever suspect foul play . Now take the bodies out to the car , and I 'll clean up in here . Now , will you make it look like an accident and not a massacre ? Well , help me ! - Tell me what to do . - I already have . There 's a big lake down there . Does that give you an idea ? Lake . Lake , lake . Now I know why people hire me to do this kind of work . ( WHIMPERING ) - Oh , no , not now . Not now . - ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( BRAKES SCREECH ) ( SUIT BEEPING ) ( BEEPING ACCELERATING ) No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( BEEPING SLOWS ) Lauren . Lauren ! Well , if you 're sure , Mr. Whyte . Yes , sir . - Nothing at the west gate . - Uh-huh . Well , Whyte just told me that if this weirdo shows up , just open the gate and let him right through . What , is he crazy ? We 're the only guards left . He dismissed everyone inside . Well , I don 't know about you , but I 'm booking off sick . HUNTER : Where 's your bimbo tonight , Whyte ? Taking care of business . POLICEMAN : Three fatal accidents and one person missing ? Come on , Mrs. Scott . We 're not stupid . What gives here ? It 's just a streak of bad luck , Lieutenant . Look , now these people work in a very high-risk business , and each of these experiments could bring a catastrophe . Now , we 've gone all these years without any mistakes . And then suddenly , the law of averages catches up with us . Okay , Mrs. Scott , it 's about time we had a little chat with your boss . ( SIREN BLARING ) ( BEEPING ) Here we go . HUNTER : Well , well , well . Hello , spaceman . WHYTE : ( OVER P.A. ) Welcome back , Carl . You 've been away too long . You 've caused us a lot of trouble , but I trust that 's over now . Now you 're gonna have to do exactly as we say , or else . And here to tell you about " or else " is my associate , Hunter . Greetings , spaceman . We want you to go directly to Gail Vernon 's lab . There you will find a remote control unit which you will put back in the appropriate slot in your suit . Failure to do so will result in severe consequences for the mother of your child . Don 't do it , Carl . They 're going to kill me anyway . ( SCREAMS ) Carl will never believe you 'd let me go . She 's probably right , you know . He 's no fool . We 've got the one bullet that can penetrate Frankenstein 's armor . Well , I hope you know what you 're doing , pal . Wait a minute . Where is he ? Uh , Sector G6 . Yeah , that 's Data Processing . He 's headed this way . Hey , spaceman , I don 't know what you 're up to , but here 's something I think you ought to hear . ( SCREAMS ) Okay , spaceman , you got 10 seconds to show your face on this screen . - All right . It 's time to do it my way . - Don 't panic . I want to dangle the bait just a little bit more . - What do you mean ? - We 're going to go to the lab . Once he sees my demonstration with his little mommy-to-be , he won 't be able to resist . - Move it . - All right . ( GASPS ) One more move and I 'll blow your brains out . I don 't believe you . Lauren ! ( SCREAMS ) You know I missed on purpose , spaceman . Now let 's all take a stroll down to Vernon 's lab . No way , Hunter . And if you hurt her again , I 'll kill you . ( WHIMPERING ) ( SCREAMS ) HUNTER : Move it . I 'm not moving . Get up or I 'll blow your brains out right here . ( COCKS GUN ) You sure she 's worth your life , Hunter ? Think about it . Okay , I got another deal for you . All I want is out . Fuck Whyte . You can have him . Now I 'm going to go right by you . If I make it , you get the girl . If I don 't , I 'm going to take her with me . - Deal ? - All right . Okay , mama , on your feet . I hear when someone touches you , you kill . Don 't be stupid , Hunter . I 'm giving you a chance . It seems like your man is avoiding you . Has the magic gone out of your relationship ? You 're dead , Hunter . All I want is you out of my way . And then you can have her . - Here . - ( SCREAMING ) Shit . Shit . Well , spaceman , I guess you win . Of course , I don 't think you 're gonna be around long enough to enjoy your victory . Looks like you 're down a couple of quarts . No way out , Hunter . Looks like the end of the line . ( CHUCKLES ) Forget it , spaceman . I 've seen you in action . You make such a mess . Don 't . Are you all right ? What happened , Carl ? I thought I couldn 't touch you . I reprogrammed myself in the computer room . I don 't have to kill anymore . ( SIGHS ) ( GASPS ) Whyte 's still in the building . I have to stop him . Stay right here . It 's Kessler and Gail Vernon . WHYTE : Welcome to the future , Carl . Now that you 're here , we can start the procedure and get things rolling . You 're just the prototype . Wait till you see the new and improved model . Can 't you see what we 've accomplished , all of us ? Anyone can be given a new life . CARL : And you 'll push all the buttons , Alex ? You want to play God , and I 'm not going to let you do that . WHYTE : You can 't stop me , Carl . Carl , what I don 't understand is why romantic slobs like you insist on keeping us in the Dark Ages . CARL : Get back , Lauren . WHYTE : Put this remote unit in and I 'll give you eternal life . CARL : This isn 't life , Alex . You think it is because that 's the way you treat life . I wouldn 't spend a second in eternity with you . WHYTE : Goodbye , Carl .

( WHIMPERING ) ( BOTH GROANING ) ( SIRENS BLARING ) MAN : This is the SF1 designed over five years ago by ARC . The outer golden fabric was melted away during the initial heat resistance evaluation which claimed the life of renowned aerospace scientist Dr. Carl Lehman . Without any regard for his own safety , Dr. Lehman relentlessly tested the environmental capabilities of the SF1 . And thanks to his gallant efforts , NASA has been able to develop a material which has proven virtually impossible to burn . Next , we 'll take a look at the actual suit worn by our first men on Mars . He was a hero , wasn 't he , Mom ? Yes , he was , Carl . Yes , he was .

 LE MONDE : Moon Child is a unique film which mixes ice and fire and in which the wind blows from the supernatural . A spectacular film that takes us where movies very rarely go today : to a dream , to the magic . LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR : Moon Child is the relevation of the Cannes Festival , a movie adventure , intimate and pernicious , mystical and sophisticated , where we feel the thrill of seeing the invisible with the magic of their images . Nothing existed yet , but his heart had opened to receive a solitary moonbeam which then fell on the mother 's lap . Then , as now , on the dark continent , black-skinned men awaited the coming of this pale and radiant child . A great fire in the sky would announce him . And , pulling back the veil , they would have their god revealed to them , the moon child . Make the table fly . Pale children have the power to do whatever they will . Mother . Remember , David , you have the power of the moon in your eyes . MOON CHILD Idiot ! Run a routine check . Did you draw these ? You think you 're different ? Why ? You know why I 'm here ? You can talk to me . - This is useless . - You 've come to adopt me . - What ? - You 've come to adopt me . Is it yours ? May I keep my drawing ? Good afternoon . I can 't be sure . It may just be childish pride , or a desire to be different . He may not be a prodigious being , but he has a powerful mind . And ... ? We have no proof . Adopt him , then . He is the moon child . They are waiting for him . Keep this with you . I promise I 'll go there . Africa ? Just remember . This is a drawing of how to get to my house . In case you need it . David ! Remember , David , you have the power of the moon in your eyes . They are your parents now . Go downstairs . - He 's the new boy ? - Yes . Wait over there . I wanted you to see this . You 'll soon get used to it . You 'll be better off here than at the Orphanage . I don 't know . Come along . I 'll show you your room . We test people like you who can do strange things . You understand ? We 'll talk it over later . Look , here it is . Do you like it ? This is for you . Maybe you 've been scared up to now because you felt different . I don 't know ... But here , we are all a bit strange . If you have the ability , we can teach you a lot . But don 't forget we are your family . And what you learn here you mustn 't use just for yourself . If you do , you 'll be punished . Good . Can anyone do better ? I can . What about something more solid ? That ! You are all part of the new project . I am happy to tell you that success is at hand . Many of you , as prodigious beings , already belonged to the Center , and know our limits . Today , albeit secretly , we are a solid group , with infiltrators at all levels . But we must go even further . For this reason , we have experimented with your minds and bodies , to create , through you , a special being . We have considered your physical and psychic state , your birth chart , position of the planets , the influence of the stars , and especially of the moon , on each of you . All this , in order to give material form , so to speak , to something which will come from the unknown . For this reason , we have gathered here all those who have helped us find the path which will lead us to an important ... Obviously , only two of you , a man and a woman , can produce this being . Those who are not chosen , however , must not think they have failed in any way . The choice is made to obtain a specific result . It is in no way a reflection on the rest of you . We will shortly have the final results . You will then be free to stay at the Center , ... or to return to your everyday life . But I am sure that what you learned here will help you greatly . Meanwhile , we must carry on in order to create this being . We must prepare the gestation , select the father , control the conception . This implies a great dependence on the Center . There can be no interruption at any stage of the process . Not with the conception , pregnancy or birth . We must create this being ourselves . The pregnancy . The birth . We must create this being ourselves . Make the moon child . May the solitary moonbeam enter me , and fill me with power . I want to be your child . They are not fools . After so many tests , they know what 's going on . - A drink ? - No , thank you . However little it may be , they know something . You told me they had to die . It 's up to you . These are the two you have chosen ? They don 't look like much , and if fact they 're not . But , genetically , they 're perfect . Edgar had quite an occultist eduction . He is the son of Laval , the desert soldier . They haven 't met for years . The father won 't miss him . No one will miss her either . She is the absolute negation of everything . Look . Georgina . Georgina ! A sweet name for such a ridiculous woman . She was difficult at the start . She 's under control now . She 's a complete alcoholic . Mentally unbalanced , and , I would say , retarded . Nevertheless , the results couldn 't be better . She shouldn 't be totally isolated , she 's very jittery , but we must be careful . Will you accompany me ? I 'm tired . Of course . It 's ironic that someone like that should be the fabled mother of the moon child . The Black would have been worse . Georgina . Mother . Well ! It 's the mouse again . Are you thirsty ? Yes , and I 'm engaged . I hate that strange orange squash they serve . Fuck ! How did you get that ? I 'll be in the wash-house . All right . You 're to be the mother of the moon child . At the next full moon , you 'll be mated with that boy with glasses , and long hair . With Edgar ? How do you know ? - I know lots of things . - So I see ! To help you , I must know more . What ? You 'll see why . But you must tell me everything , especially where it 's to be done . Why should I ? Because it 's important . Please . And I know where to get it . David ! Come here tomorrow . I 'll be waiting . What were you doing ? Wee wee . The party 's over . Go to your room . What are you doing ? Nothing . I was talking to myself . Here . Why are you so concerned about me ? I don 't want anything bad to happen to you . - You 'll protect me ? - I know a lot . Not again ! I 've never had a mother . And now you do ? Do you know where your friends have gone ? They 've just gone , that 's all . They 've been killed . It 's the truth . How do you know ? Oh , yes . " I know a lot " . I heard it . I came to help you , but I must know when you 'll be mated with Edgar . I don 't know . Please . At the next full moon . In the Observatory . Come here . Kiss me . Believe me , this is the first time . Come on ! Why are you waiting ? Stick it inside me . Such a rapid development of pregnancy is remarkable . I do believe that it augurs well . But we still haven 't noted any sign of life . - No type of energy . - That 's just it . I know what you 're driving at . But no-one knows exactly what we are hoping for , nor how it will turn out . Not even you . I won 't press the point , but I believe we 've put too much pressure on a nervy woman . She knew she had to give birth , she knew exactly when , how important it was , everything . We may be dealing with a phantom pregnancy . At such an advanced stage ? Impossible ! What would be the outcome ? She would simply expel air . That only happens with dogs . I can 't take any more ! - Wait ! - I 've waited enough ! - It 'll be worse . - Worse than what ? - That it is now ? - Yes . Are you sure ? Georgina I don 't care . I don 't want to know about it . I 'm frightened . Don 't go . Don 't go in . I 'm fed up with all this ! You 're destroying that woman and my child ! Give me our papers so we can get out of here ! There 's no contract ! Nothing legal ! All right ! Let him go . He was going to die anyway . He 'll just die sooner . I heard it . I knew it already , but they 're going to do it now . I know . I 'm a nuisance . And after the birth , they won 't need Georgina . But , God , how can we escape ? I 've been watching all their movements . There 's no way to get out . - David ! - What ? Victoria wants you . I 'm coming . I know of a way . All this part is guarded , but not this other part . Of course not . Why should it be ? Our windows are here , and they watch the corridors . If we could get to the roof , and jump across ... - It can 't be done . - Yes , it can . All the rooms have air vents . You can get to the roof that way . I 've done it . And on the other side ? I don 't know . There 's an unguarded wall . That 's all I know . Take this . It 's a house where we can go . It belongs to a friend . It 's in the country . No ! I can 't . I 've gotten too big . That 's why we must go . Once the baby 's born , it 'll be too late . We can go to my father 's house . We 'll be safe there . It 's in the desert . In Africa . In Africa ? He 'll think you 're my wife . And I 'll be your son ? Get the map back to Victoria . What ? What have you there ? - Nothing . - And what 's that ? It 's O.K. I won 't say anything . But what 's worrying you ? Nothing . Why should you let me off ? You know , I could never have children . - Why do you look at me so ? - So ? How ? You know what 's worrying me ? Can someone be born twice ? I 'm sorry . We do it tomorrow night . Steal the money now . Is everything ready ? You 've got the money ? Let 's go . Is something wrong ? Open up . I must check out a room . I can 't ... It 's important . Hurry ! Come with me . How pretty ! Come on ! Let 's move ! I 'll hold you . - Where does this lead to ? - To the roof . Come on ! - You know how to do it ? - Yes . Open it . This way . Go on , move ! Quick ! Let 's go . Something 's wrong . What about him ? Come on . What are you doing here ? Wee wee . I didn 't know . I thought he was escaping on his own . Then it was too late . We must control the pregnancy . She must give birth here . You are close to the boy , aren 't you ? We don 't want to hurt him . But he won 't talk . You understand ? They 've sent me to persuade you . They want to hurt you . Tell me ! Where are they ? David ! You love that woman . You do , don 't you ? She 's like a mother for you ? Yes . All right . Do you know where to find her ? Do you ? Yes or no ? I think so . Take this . It 's the kitchen-door key . Tonight , I 'll open this door . And then , good luck ! Thank you . I think we had a good idea . Now , let 's hope he leads us to her soon . They 're going to Africa . So am I. I know what you 're thinking . - What about her ? - She 's my mother . May I go in ? They 're asleep . There 's just an old woman . Finish it off then . Give me some more . She must give birth here . Is that clear ? But the other two ? And the old woman ? They must be killed . All three of them . Do it cleanly . This way , or this , or this . We 'll take the boat . When we get to Africa , we join a caravan to get to the military hamlet . It 's a long trip . It 'll be very hot . Are the Blacks far from there ? They 're near the river . They 're used as slaves , and then as sausage meat . It 'll be better when we get away . It 's them ! They 're coming here . There are no cartridges ! Here . Take it ! Come in . Hold it very tight . Shoot ! Shoot ! Check the area , all the city exits , train stations , ports , all means of transport . Check the woman 's family , and all routes leading to her country . I 'm going for some water . Could I have a glass of water ? Come on . Hurry up . They 're going on board . That man ! Come on . Africa ... Africa ! Africa ! What 's his name ? The man we 're going to see ? Monsieur Laval . The soldier ? Why are you going there ? So he can meet his grandson . His grandson . He asks when will you pay him ? Not before you leave . Exactly . Come back here in three days . Before the sun has risen . me , moon child . I remember David stole some pages . Of course , it may just be a supposition , ... This is no time for suppositions . We 've lost all trace of them . Old Roger ! - What ? - Edgar 's father ! Of course ! We presumed they 'd go to her family , not to his . In the desert . They 're crazy ! They couldn 't have picked a worse place than there . Me , David , and you ? It 's a hard journey for a woman . I know that . - You 've helped once . - And can again . Nevertheless , ... I know the boy . And I can fly a plane . It has to be her . I think that it is written . Do you feel better ? Yes , but I 'm cold . Mid-e-Mid said that we 'll soon reach grandfather 's house . Grandfather ? What are you talking about ? You 'll get better there . There 'll be less heat and less cold . When you 're better , we 'll go to the river . Stop talking rubbish . Mid-e-Mid knows the Blacks who live by the river . They are waiting for us . Waiting for the moon child , for me . Stop it ! Mother ... I 'm not your mother . And I 'm tired . What are you doing to my child ? We 'll be there soon . Where ? At the river , mother . So , my son is dead . And you are his wife ? Well , ... This is his son ? You are still afraid they will find you ? You are very sick . You know that ? It won 't be long now . I need to rest . All right . There is enough room here . There 's little food , little work , but you can stay . Give him a kiss . Don 't call me grandfather , please . Thank you , sir . It 's evil ! The moon is evil ! I 've killed him . I 've killed grandfather . He was like them . I did it thanks to the moon . The moon has baptized me . I am its child . Mid-e-Mid 's grandmother showed me . Look . It 's the oasis route to the river . The black slave marked the place where the tribes await the moon child . They wait for a fire in the sky that will announce his arrival . It 's our sign . We mustn 't be late . Mother ! The river ... We must leave at once . They 'll catch us here . Mid-e-mid will help us . You 'll get better . Wait and see . Come on . Victoria ! - What ? - We 're nearly there . I hope so . There 's going to be a storm . It seems he had a bad heart . David and the woman weren 't involved . She 's very ill but hasn 't given birth yet . There 's somebody who knows where they are . There she is ! You didn 't believe me . I 've been born again . They 'll have to rest up after the Erg , by the old temple , in Darmej . It 's the first well . Let 's hope they 're still there . They will be . It 's him ! Hurry up ! No , David . No . It 's all a lie . The old woman was wrong . You have no power in your eyes . You are not the child of the moon . Georgina couldn 't possibly be your mother . The old soldier had a bad heart . The moon didn 't baptize you . It didn 't kill Georgina . None of it is connected . It 's all coincidence . Your stories don 't interest me . I just want to know where the baby is . You can 't escape now , David . You must tell us . Leave me with him . Go check the animals . David , ... The old woman told me I had the power of the moon in my eyes . I don 't know if it 's true . She said so . I knew things . You know that . I knew that I had to go somewhere that wasn 't the Orphanage or the Center . The moon was waiting for me . No one understood . I was its child . I am . Nothing else matters . The moon baptised me . His grandmother gave me the new power . It rained . I was soaked ! She gave me the new power . Grandfather died because he was in the way . The moon killed him . And I ... I I must get to the river . They have always waited for me . And I for them . A fire in the sky will announce my arrival . It is so ! I 'm waiting for it . And the baby ? It is I ! It is you . We can escape in the plane . Run , but quietly . Now ! Get in quickly . Don 't move . Check the tent . Victoria ? There 's no one there . I hope it all turns out as you wish . And you ? Me ... ? I 'll go back . To the Center ? Of course . They won 't harm you ? Of course not . Don 't you worry . I 'll wait for the fire in the sky , too . And I 'll know that all is fulfilled . I love you very much . Good-bye .

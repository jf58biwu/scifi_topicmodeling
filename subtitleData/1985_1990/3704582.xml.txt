NEW WORLD PICTURES present A Salter Street Films production starring LENORE ZANN MAURY CHAYKIN KATE LYNCH KEVIN KING JOHN WALSCH and TIM CHOATE as " Howe " Music by CHRIS YOUNG Produced by B.A. GILLIAN MAURA O 'CONNELL PAUL DONOVAN Written and Directed by PAUL DONOVAN DEFCON 4 Your sister got her security clearance . We 've both been making a bet about where we think you are . She says you 're probably out on a submarine , and uh ... I say you 're probably up on that secret base somewhere around the north pole or something . I said , if you 're on a submarine uh ... you probably wouldn 't be able to get these tapes . Plus , everybody knows that submarines only stay out for three months But ... Honey , uh ... Something weird has been happening lately . I mean ... What I 'm saying is that , it 's like you died and I 've gotten over it . I was having these dreams for a long time that you did die . And then I 'd wake up and I 'd realize that if you did there would be no way I would have of knowing . And maybe you 're already dead . They kept becoming more and more real until uh ... I finally was feeling a little bit desperate . So I told them when they came to pick up the tape a few times ago and uh ... They sent out an army psychiatrist for me . He wasn 't a whole lot of help , he said he didn 't know where you were either but he knew it wasn 't dangerous so I shouldn 't worry , I should just ... Try to be patient . But um ... I don 't have him anymore . That 's because I 've decided that you are dead . I 've put that in my mind so that I won 't be too disappointed when you don 't come back . I 'll have already adjusted myself to it . But if you ever walk through that door again ... It 'll be like a miracle from God . You 'll be a gift from heaven . And my life 's gonna pick up where it left off the day you walked out . Hey . I got a surprise for you . Remember when I told you that your sister was going to get a security clearance ? Susie , come here . - Come over here and say hi to your brother . - Hi , how are ya ? Getting any lately ? I had a lot of things to tell you but I can 't remember them now . Thanks . You ... - It 's not my uh ... business . - Howe , you 're not going to give me a lecture now are you ? No . No . We 've only got six months left . Six months , Howe ! You know , I used to think that I was very tough . I mean , you have to be to get through training school with assholes like Walker . But I swear to God , I do not know if I am tough enough for six more months of this . You know what I keep thinking about ? I keep thinking about , putting on ... Too much makeup and uhh ... doing my nails real red , putting on something real slinky . Going down to some sleazy bar . Picking up a bike gang . It 's a joke Howe . - We don 't have to do this now . - Walker yes I do . They 're not that bad are they ? Mmm . It 's been a while . What ? Since you 've seen two people have sex on TV ? - Since I 've seen a woman . - I 'm crushed Walker , you got me right where I live . I need a urine sample , now . Both Washington and Moscow are gripped with alarm and confusion today . With news that an American cruise missile landed in the Soviet industrial city of Veronich . 300 miles southeast of Moscow . Although the missile contained a one megaton thermonuclear warhead , it did not detonate . And is now in the hands of Soviet defense officials . Sources close to the navy are now indicating that a US navy supply ship disguised as a tramp steamer , which was hijacked yesterday in the Mediterranean May have been carrying eleven tomahawk cruise missiles capable of reaching cities such as Veronich . The navy has stated that the hijacking was carried out by what it called " pirates " or forces who may be loyal to or under the control of the Libyan government or the North African Defense Alliance . In a moment we will go live to Washington to bring you a report on the reaction on Capitol Hill You 're not going to believe this . That US supply ship that Libya captured yesterday . It just said on the news , it had eleven tomahawks on it and one of them just landed in Russia . No official confirmation of a possible nuclear incident involving Soviet cities . But we are now aware that a full stage alert has been called for . All NATO forces , both conventional and strategic . Fighters have been scrambled . B-52 's are now airborne and cruise missiles have been dispersed to their covert launch sites in Europe . In a hastily organized speech to congress , the president indicated that American forces are fully prepared to retaliate against any aggressive moves by the Soviets . He has advised the nation to go about it 's business as normal until the tension subsides . The president closed his address by stating that ... Get Walker ! Walker ! Walker ! I don 't believe it . Def Con 2 . You ready to do this ? Maybe we should see if we can detect anything . So what have you got ? I think I 'm coming up with heat trails on infra-red , lots of them . Super atmospheric ? - Alright Walker , fire . - No look it might be some sort of limited exchange , military targets maybe ! Lets wait for War 1 before we fire ! This is only a bad dream . Alright look , it 's happening , right ? - Yes Jordan , it 's happening . - Alright then launch , Walker ! We 'll launch when we get War 1 . The order can 't get through . Look ... We 're supposed to fire on our own discretion if we have evidence that an attack has started and we believe that War 1 can 't get through We 'll launch when I say to launch , ok ! ? Try some Earth signals . Will do ! ... have explosions over seven Soviet cities ... The stations are all disappearing ! They 're all getting blown away ! - What about the baby ? - Shut up Howe . Nobody has a chance to live in a remote area . Mine are in Seattle , I just saw Seattle go . I 'll check Detroit . We have a solid object alert . Russian , right ? It 's Russian isn 't it ? Walker , we 've got to do it now , we don 't have any more time . We 've got to drop the payload ! Walker , you bastard ! Fight ! I 'm warning you Jordan . - Twelve kilometers per second . - The range Howe ! - 642 kilometers . - That gives us 50 seconds - Which one of our warheads passes closest to it ? - The Leningrad is four degrees off . - What number is Murmansk ? - Seven . Seconds ... Make it twelve ! Ready . Do it ! Of course all these results are conditional . On what ? On what ? I don 't know on what . This does not account for the ... unknown . I mean all these estimates are based on ... Atmospheric conditions , radiation levels , surface movement . Weather , all things measureable from thousands of miles away . So what area came out best ? Antarctica . OK . Say we got no orders and decided to go back to Earth . Where should we go to insure our best chance of survival ? Seychells . Easter Island . Parts of Central America . I can 't help but notice . You 've been listening to that thing at the same time every night . I suppose it doesn 't make any difference . I 'm listening for my wife , she 's got a transmitter sort of like a ham radio . Cecil ? Cecil ? I don 't know if you can hear me or not but I 'm going to do this anyway . You 're probably dead like most people . Please believe it even if you don 't get this . there 'll be a farewell from my spirit to your spirit . Honey , we didn 't get hit , so everything was ok at first Everything is ok , except ... Except that your sister and a lot of people in Redwood county they got blinded . But then we got the disease . And some people they think I 've got something probably from the radiation . It 's terrible . Everybody 's dying . They say the germs have been affected by the radiation . Honey . The baby died . He got the disease . And they found out and they shot him and they burned him right away . And then they took all the food that we 'd buried and I have to stay quarantined in the house now . I don 't feel well . My gums are bleeding . I think I 've got it too . I miss you so much . So ... I want to see you again , I don 't want to die . We 're going to try to get away . Radiation down there is incredibly high . Yeah , it is . But we 're going back to Earth ... Now ! Sorry ? I 'm going to help them . I 'm going to help Alice and my sister get out of there somehow . Howe . Your wife is dead . You ! ... fuckface ! Howe ! Calm down ! We 're not going down into any radioactive ... Disease-land . You just calm down now . Get your hands off me . Well alright . What about you Jordan ? Howe , I haven 't got anybody back there to go looking for . On the other hand , we 're really not doing any good up here . I think that we should support him . Alright , there you have it . Two for , one against . We 're going back ! Two for and one against . That one happens to be me ! And I 'm the captain ! And this is not a Democracy . So we 're staying ! This isn 't my program . Walker ! Walker , we 've got to jettison the bombs ! - I gave them 60 hours . - That 'll have to do . Number 11 won 't stay on . Do it ! Howe , I don 't know what you did . But I 'm going to kill you what I get half the chance . I 'm telling you this is going down by itself , this is NOT my program ! I 've got an O-2 leak on four . Not a very good landing . Jordan ! I can 't find a pulse . Man I think she broke her neck ! Her pupil moved . She 's not dead . - She 's got a pulse . - Oh great . I think it 's just a concussion . Got a shovel ? It wasn 't me that made us come down here . This is useless . Useless ! Ok , I 'll dig . Maybe I should see if number 11 was really malfunctioning when we jettisoned the bombs . I said n ... Listen ... Wait . Yeah I know I heard them . I know I can hear it . Hey ! Hey guys ! Can you hear me ? Quick . You know , we got ... We got months of food , Walker . Months of it ! And uh ... I don 't know we 'll find us a boat and ... I don 't ... build us a raft or something that 'll ... Head down to someplace safe like Central America . And uh ... I drop you off or ... I don 't know you could come with me , I 'm going to head up to Oregon . And uh ... I don 't know , you think we could find a boat around here ? I don 't know . Hey , I see , I can feel them . I can feel a guy there , you guys ! Come on ! Hey ! Hey they 've got a hold of my hand . Hey , Walker ! Get it off ! Got my hand dude ! Walker ! They 've got my hand ! Walker ! Walker ! - Walker what are you doing ? - Hold on ! I 've got ... I 'm there Walker . I 'm there ! WALKER ! No ! Walker ! Hey Jordan . Welcome to Earth . Don 't do anything before you listen to this . I now accept the fact . That Alice must surely be dead . And Jordan , Walker 's dead too . Six hours ago . We were trying to dig our way out of here . And somebody ... or something ... out there , grabbed him and killed him . I 'm going to take advantage of the dark . I 'm going to leave and ... try to find ... somebody . I 'll try to be back at 08 : 00 . I 'll knock 3 times . Don 't let anybody else in . Uh , hello . Look my name is Hal . I 'm a ... Lt. Commander with NORAD . You know what that it ? That 's the North American Air Defense . I 've got nothing to do with those guys . I 've been in space for the last 15 months , I came down here last night . They , they , those guys they started chasing me . I ... they , they killed my ... What do you want ? I got ... I got 4 months supply of food ! Let 's talk about the food . You finished ? You 're pretty wasteful . thanks . Who is that ? So you expect me to believe that you 're from NORAD ? And that you came here from outer space . For no reason ? Look I don 't expect you to believe anything . All I know is I got 4 months supply of food and if you don 't believe it then you 're just passing it up . I 'll make you a deal on the food . You give me the food or I 'll kill you . What do I get if I give it to you ? You get to live . If you 're lucky . - If I 'm lucky ? - Yes . You give me the food . And I 'll let you go , you get to skedaddle on down the road . And then the kids will kill you . And I 'll be happy and the kids will be happy , and you 'll be dead . Well I don 't like that deal . What if I give you half of the food . In exchange for one of those guns . You 've got a sense of humor . What would you do if I gave you the gun , and half the food ? Look , I just want to get out of here . Go to someplace safe , maybe Central America ? Just get in your rocketship and fly off to Central America ? . No . I figure I 'll find a boat . What kind of boat ? Sailboat . Do you think that , if there was a sailboat around here ... I would be sitting here , breathing in radiation ? It 's those damn kids ! Hello . Hi . If you don 't mind me asking who you are ? No . Who are you ? None of your business . Would you untie me ? Uh ... Listen . You untie me . I 'll get you some real strawberries . You want shrimp cocktail ? I 've got shrimp cocktail . Want a turkey dinner , you got it ! I 've got crates of food . You know how to sail ? Yeah . You look kinda ... Innocent , but uh ... What choice have I got , right ? Ok . Ok , I 'll make a deal . We split your food . And I 'll get us to a sailboat . But if you leave me . You lose the boat . Got it ? ! Good . Alright then . What kind of boat is it ? What do you mean what kind of boat ? It 's a sailboat . How big is it ? Big enough . Ok Captain Walker . Let 's go . Walker ? Put the guns down . Get outside . - Why ? - Cause I don 't want to mess up my floor . - You don 't want the food ? - I don 't give a shit about the food anymore . Get outside . - Well th ... there 's more than food , there 's marijuana . - Oh really ? What kind ? - Columbian . - Oh wow , I don 't smoke dope and I don 't like people who do . - Well listen , you think you 're going to find this food . Keep it all to yourself ? You 're not even ... - I told you I don 't give a shit about the food ! She won 't let you in . You won 't get in . Who 's she ? She 's an astronaut . She 's a doctor . What 's she like ? She 's ... got brown hair . What ... what kind of aerolas does she have ? Pink , brown or red ? Red . Pointed or rounded ? Pointed . So if uh ... Say I give you a knife . and let you go , you give me two thirds of the food and this woman ? I 'll give you three quarters of the food . That 's very white of you . So we have a deal ? Yeah . As long as there 's no surprises , we have a deal . Terminals ! Get low ! Is this the beach ? I don 't know . Yeah , maybe . It was dark . J.J. I want you to go over that hill . And see if you can see any uh ... rocketship . And watch out for the lunatics from Fort Liswell . J.J. ! I don 't like it . Vinny McKinnon . We meet again . Really nice to see you again Vinny . It 's a fake ! Pull , you lazy bastards ! Pull you bastards ! Get your backs into it , come on ! You in the blue , pull your own weight ! Put your backs into it ! Put your backs into it I said ! I 'm talking to you ! You in the blue jacket ! Alright , let 's this time do it for real ! Pull ! Put your backs into it ! Sit down . I 've got something real special to show you . Tell me Commander Howe ... you wouldn 't happen to know in which direction the prevailing winds blow in Padagonia would you ? What ? Well , since Padagonia is in the southern hemisphere , the prevailing winds should blow in from the east . But the mountains are in the way . Commander , do you think the fallout could get over the mountains ? How did you know my name ? Good things do come in three . I 've missed you J.J. And you must be Vinny McKinnon . Lacey would you remove them before they putrify the room please ? Let them join Dr. Jordan , see to it that they are as comfortable as she is . I estimate that everyone here will be contaminated within the next two months . The only solution is to escape to a clean zone . Provided you can find the location of one . I want you to know I 'm really sorry about what happened to your friend Walker . Some terminals found the capsule before we did so there was nothing we could do . You know I was kind of surprised when I found out that you people were up there . - I never suspected we had a secret line of space defense . - You weren 't supposed to suspect . We found it . - You sure ? - Says delta S-16 Oh good news . I guess that means I won 't need Commander Howe after all , will I ? Let him join his friends . Oh , sorry ... Jesus ! - Delta S-16 , excellent . - I 'll have this sucker out of here in no time . - Ok . - Lacey uh ... be real careful . We 'll bring it straight to Boomer 's hut right away , ok . - You got it . - Hey innocent , is that you ? - Yeah . - It 's me . - Howe , Jesus , Howe ! Jordan ! You alright ? Yeah Howe , I 'm alright . Did you get my tape ? Yeah . - Jordan I ... - Howe I 'm so glad you 're alright . Um ... This is Mrs. Boyd . She stole a can of peaches . Can of peaches . Can you believe it ? I 've gotten a little confused here , give me a few answers . Who 's this guy Gideon Hayes ? My boyfriend . Your boyfriend . Yeah . Ex-boyfriend now . I was trying to get away from him when ... - Vinny caught me in the woods . - So ... so what happened here , I mean how did this kid Gideon get control of all these people ? He has his ways . You um ... might be interested to know how he 's had control of you . What are you talking about ? The day of the war , two months ago I guess it was , I was at school just changing classes with Gideon . When this navy helicopter lands on the lawn and Gideon 's father gets out . Well , next thing I know I 'm at 5000 feet in a helicopter carrying all this satellite equipment . - Satellite equipment ? - Yeah ! With Gideon 's mom and dad and a bunch of ... navy brass . And I 'm worried about missing my poly-sci test til I find out I 'm in the middle of World War III So what happened to all these navy people ? Where are his parents now ? They 're dead . We crashed . I guess the helicopter was affected by a blast . Only four of us survived . Gideon and I , and Lacey who 's a marine corporal and um ... a navy technician , a fat guy called Boomer who operated the equipment . He was paralyzed in the crash though , his back was broken . Ok just ... hold on a minute . You 're saying this guy Boomer had something to do with me landing here , that 's what you 're saying ? Uh .. well yeah but Gideon made him because he wants to get to a survival station . See , Gideon made Boomer transmit a program that would force you to land here when you decided to re-enter . There 's no way this guy Boomer could have had the facilities to do that . Well then you explain how you got here . You guys wait out here . Boomer . You did a very good job . I think we found our missing piece and all the credit goes to you . Boomer , how 's your diet coming ? Brought you a nice big juicy cut of venison . Now I know that we haven 't been the best of friends in the past . But we can make up . And after that you 'll have a nice meal . You can 't do it without me . I 've got nothing to live for . Let 's not be like that . Let 's be fair with one another . I want to know where the survival stations are and you know how to find out . We can make a business proposition . You help me this one last time , and I 'll let you go . Well . We 'll just start hooking up our little box while the steak is cooking . Perfect . Ok Boomer . How do you want your steak cooked ? Where were you supposed to be headed in this helicopter ? Well we were trying to get to a submarine that was waiting just off the coast of Newfoundland . A lot of government big-wigs were headed there too , but we had all their satellite equipment . I 'm sure they were rather unhappy that their equipment didn 't show up . I bet they were unhappy . Come on sweetie , let 's go . Boomer , your steak is almost done . I wouldn 't want it to get burnt , that would be wasteful . Especially with so many people going hungry these days . - You 'll give it to me if I tell you ? - You have my word . What difference does it make ? It 's just a password . Type " E pluribus funk " . E pluribus funk ? Ah Boomer I knew you 'd come through . Boomer . You 've been a royal pain . But you did come through so I guess I 'll have to keep my word . Smells good , doesn 't it ? I 'm sorry , here let me ... Oh ... I 'm really sorry , well ... I guess it 's too dirty for me to pick up now . I think you better go down for it . Boy Boomer , do you smell . You ought to pay more attention to your personal hygiene . Well , you 're on your own . Oh , and uh ... Thanks a lot . See this ? 62.17.20 By north 19.02.40 . Know what that is ? The latitude and longitude of a survival station still intact , I bet . Very sharp . And that 's where you and I and a couple of the others will be sailing starting tomorrow . - Does that make you happy ? - No . I don 't think you understand what I 'm saying , you see I 'm forgiving you for walking out on me . Well , I don 't forgive you . For what ? - For being a snake . - Come on J.J. You think I 'm ruthless because I want to be . It 's the only way to administer limited resources in an unstable situation , can 't you see that ? You want to go or not ? Come on what do you say . I say ... go fuck yourself ! Take her back to her friends , please . J.J. Put up a notice that there will be a trial tomorrow morning . Everyone should enjoy that . Hey Jordan , wondering what 's going to happen to you ? The rules have changed Jordan . Looking good Vinny ! What 's the matter ? You miss your mommy ? Say goodnight ! J.J. Oh , you look so pretty J.J. You make me sick ! Howe ! Real cool Howe . All rise in the presence of Gideon Hayes . Sit down . We have before us today Commander Cecil Howe . Doctor Ava ... Eva Jordan . Jacqueline Jameson and Vincent McKinnon . Commander Howe and doctor Jordan , you 've admitted your participation in the nuclear war machine that has brought such devastation in our lives . So you stand accused of crimes against humanity . So lets have it . All those who find Commander Howe and doctor Jordan guilty ... - Say " Aye " . - " AYE " { chorus of voices } All those who find Cecil Howe and Eva Jordan not guilty say " nay " . Guilty . Hang the bitch ! Jacqueline Jameson also known as J.J. stands accused of the worst of crimes , treason . She was one of my closest friends and my having to bring her here before you demonstrates the gravity of her crime . - All those who find J.J. guilty . - " AYE " { chorus of voices } Not guilty ? Guilty . And our friend Vincent McKinnon . Vinny 's presence has been long awaited in this courtroom . He stands accused of so many crimes against the people of Fort Liswell that I shall not bother to list them . - All those who find Vincent McKinnon guilty , say " aye " . - " AYE " { chorus of voices } No ! Not guilty ? Guilty . Does anyone have anything to add before I pass sentence ? This court hereby sentences Commander Cecil Howe , doctor Eva Jordan , Jacqueline Jameson and Vincent McKinnon to hang by the neck until they are dead . Such sentence to be executed immediately . I have an idea . Uh , take the tape off of J.J. ' s mouth . I 'm feeling in a generous mood . I 'm going to pardon you J.J. But that pardon is conditional . J.J. , you have to pull the lever that hangs the others . So , do you accept ? I 'm still feeling in a generous mood . I 'll make the same offer to the rest of you . I 'll give one of you your freedom if you hang your friends . If you accept , be the first to step forward . Come on , yes or no . Good man , Howe . Cut him down please Coming through , coming through . When the drum stops , pull the lever . If he doesn 't pull it , shoot him , please . Where 's Howe ? Find him ! - Let 's go lady ! - Yeah , yeah ok uh ... release them . - Look you 're in no position ... - You got no time to argue kid , release them . - Put Vinny and J.J. back in the bunker . - Ok , second condition , no hangings . Ok , no hangings . Alright , I 'll get my stuff from the ship . You try anything at all and you 're all dead , ok ? Ok kid . - Don 't put any strain on it for a week , etc. etc. etc . - Very nice work , doctor Jordan . I should take you with me . Too bad there 's not enough food . Yeah , you 're a real prince Gideon , but uh ... I think I 'll just take my chances with the others , ok ? No , that wasn 't the deal . You 're staying here for the meantime and as for Vinny and J.J. Well I promised not to hang them . But they were lawfully sentenced so I 'll have them shot . Why don 't you give me another shot of painkiller . - N .. no look , I 've only got morphine here . I think it 's a little strong . - Morphine 's fine . Come on woman . - Lacey will you get ... - No , I ... I 've got it . That 's alright . Why don 't you let me do it , ok ? Lacey . Hold her down please . Try to play me for stupid ? God ... damn ... kid . Let 's see what was in that bottle . Potassium . Not a very good painkiller . Hey up there ! Talk to me !

Welcome to another edition of Thunderdome ! Listen on ! Listen on ! This is the truth of it . Fighting leads to killing , and killing gets to warring . And that was damn near the death of us all . Look at us now , busted up and everyone talking about hard rain . But we 've learned by the dust of them all . Bartertown 's learned . Now when men get to fighting , it happens here . And it finishes here . Two men enter , one man leaves . Two men enter , one man leaves . And right now , I 've got two men . Two men with a gut full of fear . Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls dying time 's here ! He 's the ball cracker . Death on foot . You know him . You love him ! He 's Blaster ! The challenger , direct from out of the Wasteland . He 's bad . He 's beautiful . He 's crazy ! It 's the man with no name ! Thunderdome 's simple . Get to the weapons , use them anyway you can . I know you won 't break the rules . There aren 't any .

" Bust a deal and face the wheel . Bust a deal and face the wheel . All our lives hang by a thread . Now we 've got a man waiting for sentence . But ain 't it the truth ?

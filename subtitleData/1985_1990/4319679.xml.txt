 [ birds chirping ] [ rat squeals ] [ rat squealing ] [ chatters ] [ speaking Russian ] [ all chattering in Russian ] Nyet . ( Archangel ) You may be his only hope for escape . ( Hawke ) So you have other options ? Of course . We could always invade Russia . Moses will make his way to that hunting cabin . It 's in a remote section of the Urals , about 90 kilometers east of Sverdlovsk . Marella will give you precise coordinates for Airwolf 's computer . Moses ? ( Marella ) lf you 'd read the dossier , Stringfellow , instead of just looking at all the pretty pictures , you would know that Vladimir Rostoff 's code name is Moses . [ whines ] Cute . Thank you . ( Archangel ) I don 't think either of you realizes the seriousness of the situation . Yes , sir . If Moses has blown his cover after 22 years , it has to be for something big . He 's risen higher than we 'd dared hope . Kept us out of at least a dozen small wars , and maybe , on a couple of occasions , the big one . And now , he 's thrown all that away and whatever it 's worth so you can bet it has to be for something damn important . Who 's this ? Natalya and Tanya Rostoff . So he 's got a family ? He 's been there 22 years . I assume you 've got a refueling tanker somewhere over the Norwegian basin . Yes . That 's still a 3,000-mile round trip through Russian airspace . Airwolf can make it , but not with five people . She can if you strip the armament . [ Hawke laughs ] You 're asking me to fly Airwolf into Russia without any guns ? It 's the only way . It 's not exactly like pulling a mole out of Indian territory . ( Archangel ) I told you . He 's got something big or he wouldn 't be coming out . ( Marella ) Rostoff is no ordinary agent . On his first assignment he was decorated for saving the life of a fellow agent when the mission went sour . Marella . That agent 's name is Michael Goldsmith Briggs lll . ( Marella ) Code named- - Archangel . That has nothing to do with it . ( Hawke ) Of course not . Will you take the mission ? " The Third , " huh ? I wouldn 't throw stones , Stringfellow . ( Marella ) Sir , could I play devil 's advocate for a moment ? ( Archangel ) I encourage it . Well , some of our sister agencies suspect that we 're in liaison with Hawke and Airwolf . They haven 't been able to prove it . No , sir . But you can be sure that if they suspect , so do the Russians . And that this might possibly be an elaborate effort by the Soviets to capture Airwolf . Anything is possible , but it 's not very probable . I agree , unless one of two things has happened . One . : the Soviets have uncovered Moses and are using him . Giving him something that he thinks is so important he 's got to bring us in to extract him . No . If the KGB uncovered him , they wouldn 't risk his slipping away in a ruse to capture Airwolf . Two . : he 's been living in Russia for over 20 years . He 's got a wife , daughter , friends . He may have turned . I didn 't say you would like it . I think it stinks . Yes , sir . ( Archangel ) I assume you 've run these scenarios of yours through the computer ? ( Marella ) Yes , sir . I took the statistics from all our counterintelligence agencies , both foreign and domestic , who operate deep undercover agents . I cross-referenced them with those that have turned and added the psychological probability of change due to midlife crisis , sexual promiscuity , children reaching- - Damn it , Marella , what 's the bottom line ? The odds are 50-50 that Hawke is flying Airwolf into a trap . ( Dominic ) lt 's the stupidest plan I ever heard . ( Dominic ) Some Russky out hunting bear with a bow and arrow could bring us down . ( Hawke ) They 'd better have armor-piercing arrows . Oh , you know what I mean . Yeah . You don 't like the plan . [ exclaims ] I think it stinks . You got a better one ? You bet . Let 's not go at all . [ both laughing ] [ vehicle approaching ] [ Dominic sighs ] No matter how many times I see her , she still takes my breath away . Yeah . [ clicking ] [ gauges beep ] [ engine whirring ] [ beeping ] [ beeping ] ( pilot ) $ 10 it 's an SR-7 1 . ( co-pilot ) Harrier Jet . ( pilot ) What the hell would we be doing refueling a Harrier within spitting distance of Russia ? I don 't know the mission . I just know it 's a Harrier . Why else would we be using a straight line refueling rig ? An SR-7 1 uses a straight line refueling rig . I didn 't know that . That 's why you 're gonna lose $ 10 . ( Tembrusco ) Captain , I--I ... ( Tembrusco ) I have an--an aircraft approaching for hookup . ( pilot ) What is it ? ( Tembrusco ) I 'd rather not say , sir . ( Dominic ) According to the computer , we 'll be penetrating Soviet airspace in six minutes . ( Hawke ) Right . That 's all you got to say ? For now . We 're going on the deck the rest of the way . Oh . I was afraid it 'd be something like that . [ snorts ] What do you call " on the deck " ? ( Hawke ) About 50 feet . Give or take a few . It ain 't the 50 feet I 'm worried about . It 's the give or take . [ beeping ] ( Dominic ) Uh-oh . ( Dominic ) I got two bogies . Angels 30 . ( Dominic ) Closing fast on a heading of 015 . ( Hawke ) MiGs ? ( Dominic ) MiG 23s . Hey , I thought this was Finland . I don 't think the Soviets pay too much attention to road signs around their borders . Hang on . They 're directly overhead . Altitude ? ( Dominic ) Angels 30 . ( Dominic ) I 'm absorbing 90 % of their radar scans . ( Dominic ) They 're maintaining altitude . Heading northeast . ( Dominic ) Hey , I don 't think they spotted us , String . Ooh , when the sun goes down here , it really goes down , huh ? ( Hawke ) It comes up just as fast . We have about eight hours this time of the year . Three in , three out , and two to pick Moses up . ( Dominic ) Uh-oh . Maybe less . ( Dominic ) Those MiGs are descending and coming back . Now , why would they do a thing like that ? Well , Dom , they might 've spotted us . ( Dominic ) They 're climbing . I think they lost us . Oh , my God , nobody can fly blind this low . ( Hawke ) I know . Then pull up . I can 't . The Russians would pick us up on radar . It 's better than in little pieces . ( Dominic ) Oh , String , this is nuts . Those MiGs gone ? Yeah , moving off the grid to the north . Turn on my helmet view . It 's the C.C. panel . [ machine humming ] ( Dominic ) Mamma mia ! What is that ? ( Hawke ) S.L.A.S. Starlight amplification system . It amplifies available light a million times . Turns night into day . Oh , that 's great , String . But now that the MiGs are gone , can 't we go up just a little ? Yeah , I guess we can ease up a few feet . Thank you . ( Archangel ) Well , if they haven 't snagged a snowdrift or been run over by a herd of reindeer , they should be approaching that cabin just about now . Then one way or another we should know what 's happening soon . We won 't , but they will . ( Marella ) Knightsbridge , this is Angel One . ( Marella ) I 'm five miles out over the main gate . ( Marella ) Request a Jericho approach to the pad . ( controller ) Angel One . Knightsbridge . Approach approved . You are cleared to land . ( Dominic ) According to the computer , we 're within 10 kilometers of the cabin . ( Dominic ) No , wait . You better slow down . We 're four , three , two , one . String , I got a heat source at three o 'clock 100 meters up . Could be human . ( Hawke ) Hit the lights . Invite him into the clearing . ( Dominic ) Right . [ computer beeping ] ( Dominic ) Hey , see if you can get him to look up , will you ? [ thudding ] I said get him to look up , not scare the hell out of me . Sorry . Is it him ? ( Dominic ) A little older , but it 's him . You got any other heat sources ? Nope . That 's too bad . Why , you looking for trouble ? No . But if Rostoff 's bringing his family out , there ought to be two other heat sources somewhere in the area . [ gauges beep ] Rostoff ? I came to take you home , Moses . I thought you were Soviet military . Why , are they hunting you ? I must assume so . They may have deduced by now it was no accident . What ? I 've been without sleep for three days . My thinking is a bit muddled . I stole a biological weapon and covered the theft by creating an accident , a fatal accident . Some of them were my friends . It must be some weapon . It is . Aircarried . Lethal in two seconds . Totally undetectable and untraceable . The only deterrent is for both sides to have it then each will fear retaliation . Archangel was right . You are an exceptional man . How is Michael ? Oh , he 's a little the worse for wear but he 's still recruiting the most beautiful and intelligent women in the world . I used to think that would be his downfall . Now I think it may be his strength . We gotta get going . Yes , of course . Where is your family ? They 're waiting at Kirivitz , 200 kilometers east of here . Hey , I 'm not running a shuttle bus service . I didn 't know how long it would take the Firm to extract me . I couldn 't risk my family being caught here with me . My orders are to get you out . You would separate a man from his family ? If I had to . Yes . That 's why I left the serum I stole with my wife . Your helicopter , it 's incredible . Mach 1 plus . ( Rostoff ) We have nothing like this . ( Dominic ) What do you mean " we " ? I mean the Soviets . I.R. jamming . Automatic defense system . Stealth mode . ( Rostoff ) A choice of 14 offensive weapons . [ chuckling ] We wish . We had to strip the guns to- - ( Hawke ) Dom . Huh ? ( Hawke ) Have you got that readout on Kirivitz ? Of course . You had to trade weight for fuel . You have nothing to shoot with , do you ? I always save a little something . Kirivitz . ( Dominic ) Agra community . 1,200 people . 62 degrees north , 51 degrees west . My family will be at my wife 's brother 's farm , north of the village . Hey , String . There 's a Soviet missile complex all around Kirivitz . It 's gotta have more security than Fort Knox . The missiles were removed three months ago . ( Rostoff ) Those silos are empty and so are the barracks . ( Rostoff ) It 's part of the air defense rotation program . ( Dominic ) Yeah , but that 's not what the computer says . Then the computer is wrong . Archangel gave us the latest tapes for this mission . Then there is obviously an intelligence lag . Or you 're lying . [ owl hooting ] [ crickets chirruping ] [ men chattering in Russian ] [ aircraft approaching ] ( Rostoff ) We are how far from the farmhouse ? ( Dominic ) 10,000 meters . Amazing . ( Dominic ) I count five people . ( Rostoff ) My family and Turgyev 's wife and son . What do you think , Dom ? ( Dominic ) Why ask me now ? I don 't think we should 've have taken this job in the first place . I think we should have gone home from the cabin . And I think we 're walking right into a trap . And I think that you 're gonna do whatever you 're gonna do no matter what I think . So why you asking me what I think ? ( Hawke ) Hey , sorry . ( Rostoff ) There is a missile silo a mile to the west and another a mile and a half south . They 're both connected to the road that 's in front of the farm . As I said , they are empty , so you can take your pick . Dom ? ( Dominic ) Now , let 's see . I 've got a small clearing , big enough , but not too big . There 's a creek that runs through it to the farm about 1,500 meters on a heading of 215 . Okay . [ men chattering in Russian ] [ continue chattering ] ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ man singing in Russian ] [ door shuts ] ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ singing continues ] ( Dominic ) Nice , huh ? ( Rostoff ) Turgyev has a great voice . He used to sing in the army choir . [ humming ] Kind of catchy . Where 've I heard that before ? It 's a song of bloodshed . Of struggle . Of glory . A song of the Revolution . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ Turgyev continues singing ] Revolu- - Oh , now I remember . You mean I 've been humming a Communist song ? Think of it as a Russian version of Yankee Doodle Dandy . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ Turgyev continues singing ] Hey , hold on a minute , let 's have a look . [ crickets chirruping ] ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ singing continues ] Just your family , huh ? ( Rostoff ) Turgyev 's in the local militia . They must be his friends . ( Dominic ) Oh , really ? Probably on a routine patrol checking the empty missile silos . ( Rostoff ) To guard against vandalism . With AK-47 s ? I 'll get rid of them . ( Hawke ) No . You yourself said we were on a tight schedule . Did you ever think that maybe your accident has been discovered and they 're here to pick you up ? They don 't send the local militia for that , Mr. Hawke . ( Hawke ) Hey . [ gun clicks ] Shoot me and you lose the serum . [ gun cocking ] And you lose your life . [ thunder rumbling ] ( Marella ) The 1800 situation report is in . Well ? There 's unusual Soviet air activity near the Manchurian border . Over 2,000 miles from Airwolf . A satellite was launched at 1 200 Zulu time from their space center at Baikonur . Orbit ? North-south elliptical , covering England , France , Italy . They 're beefing up their M.R. Missile spotting network . Armored activity near Polish border . There was a work stoppage at Lodz yesterday . The Russians are just flexing their muscles . And the rest was on the 1 200 report . What is it ? An update in the communication section . " increased radio traffic on KGB frequencies " throughout the central Urals . Specifically in the Sverdlovsk area . " It 's beginning to look like you could be right . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ balalaika playing ] ( Dominic ) Hmm , beautiful . ( Dominic ) Sounds like one of them sad Italian arias , huh ? ( Rostoff ) lt 's a song about a young couple who die of unrequited love . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ man singing ] Romeo and Juliet . [ laughs ] This was sung on the steppes of Russia long before Shakespeare was born . He probably stole the idea from us . There you go with that " us " again . I am Russian , Mr. Santini . I thought you were an American . I was born in a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania , of Russian parents . I was rocked to sleep to Russian lullabies . I celebrated Christmas on January 5 . Prayed to God in a Russian Orthodox church . And when I fell in love , it was with a Russian girl . I am American by birth and political conviction . But my heart and soul is Russian . [ crickets chirruping ] Hmm !

Rostoff , we don 't have time for this . You should have told your daughter earlier . ( Tanya ) Yes . You should have . Hey , she speaks English . And French and Italian . We are not ignorant . [ speaking French ] Excuse me . [ speaking Russian ] lf you speak English , speak English . Nyet ! I don 't think she likes us , String . Neither do I . ( Hawke ) ln your place I wouldn 't like us much , either . But the reality is , your husband has to leave Russia or he 's gonna be shot . Nyet . Da . [ speaking Russian ] [ speaking Russian ] [ speaking Russian ] [ Natalya speaking Russian ] [ speaking Russian ] [ speaking Russian ] English , please . ( Natalya ) My brother does not speak English . Then he 's excused . The rest of you aren 't . Have you got that serum ? In the bedroom . Hold on a minute . You say your brother-in-law 's in the militia , where does he keep his gun ? Also in the bedroom . Dom . Yeah , sure . [ Tanya speaking Russian ] ( Hawke ) Tanya , I like your spunk but if you don 't start speaking English I 'm gonna spank your butt . ( Rostoff ) Stop it , Tanya . ( Rostoff ) I 'm doing what I feel I must . Not for America , for people . For Russians and Americans . [ speaking Russian ] By betraying our country ? It 's not a simple matter of betrayal . It seems simple to me . That 's because you are young and naive . Perhaps . But I am old enough to know that I will not betray my country . Nor I mine . But Russia is your country . No , Tanya . Russia is my heritage . The United States is my country and I took an oath to protect it , even if it cost me my life . [ helicopter approaching ] ( Hawke ) I suppose it 's just the local militia dropping by for some tea , huh ? ( Rostoff ) They know the lab was not an accident . ( Dominic ) ls it Russian ? ( Dominic ) Never mind . [ helicopter whirring ] ( Rostoff ) We can try for your helicopter if one of us decoys them . [ Natalya yells in Russian ] [ grunting ] [ pilot shouting in Russian ] [ pilot continues shouting in Russian ] ( pilot speaking English ) Do not move or I will shoot . [ pilot shouting in Russian ] On the count of three , douse that light . And you get that lamp . And then hide behind that stove . You ready ? Da . One . ( Dominic ) Two . [ glass breaking ] ( Dominic ) Three . [ Natalya and Tanya sobbing ] [ women screaming ] ( Dominic ) Anybody hit ? ( Rostoff ) No . [ Rostoff speaking Russian ] ( Hawke ) Don 't shoot . ( Dominic ) lf my reflexes were just a little faster , you 'd have been a dead bunny . I was counting on that . ( Dominic ) T-Turgyev ? ( Hawke ) He 's okay . ( Hawke ) Took off toward the road , I think . [ helicopter whirring ] ( Rostoff ) What is it ? ( Hawke ) Get down ! [ guns firing ] [ women screaming ] [ helicopter receding ] He 's not trying to kill us . Yeah ? You couldn 't prove it by me . No , he 's shooting high . Or trying to keep us pinned down till they get ground support . We 'll have to decoy him to get out of here . ( Rostoff ) I will do it if you will get my family out . No , Papa . No ! We will not go without you . [ Rostoff speaking Russian ] Nyet ! [ sobbing ] Nyet . ( Hawke ) Hey , Moses , I don 't know what they 're saying , but it sounds like " no " to me . I 'm not gonna haul two screaming , kicking women through the woods in the dark . Not when there 's another way . What other way ? Hey , she ain 't got no guns , remember ? [ glass breaking ] [ women screaming ] [ bullets ricocheting ] And in case you hadn 't noticed , he does . Yeah , well , I figure that 'll just about make it even . [ guns firing ] [ women screaming ] [ clock ticking ] ( Marella ) Do you want something to eat ? What ? Can I get you a sandwich or some hot soup ? I could send to- - Oh , no , no , thank you , no . Oh , not yet , please , Marella . I wanna enjoy the sunset . I 'm sorry . For what ? For being right . Don 't write this mission off yet . But it 's sunrise over the Urals . Hawke was supposed to rendezvous with the tanker 15 minutes ago . That doesn 't mean he 's failed . Just that he 's late . Sir , if I were to put this mission through my computer right now , the odds would be a 1,000-to-1 against it . Probably higher . But we 've got one thing going for us . What ? Hawke doesn 't know the odds . ( Rostoff ) He must hate me . ( Dominic ) Who , Turgyev ? No . Not the way he greeted you last night . Oh , he ... He may be hurt and angry . But given time , he 'll remember all the good things between you . You say you sang together ? All the time . ( Rostoff ) Our families used to say we drove them crazy , but they loved it . ( Rostoff ) Especially the children . ( Dominic ) He 'll remember . [ birds chirping ] You 're a philosopher , Mr. Santini . Me ? No . I 've just lived a little . And I 'd like to continue . I wonder what the hell he 's up to . ( Rostoff ) lt is over . No . We ain 't finished yet . At least he got out with the serum . What are you talking about ? Hawke ? Of course . He did what he had to do : get the serum back . Yeah , well , you don 't know Hawke . I 'm gonna teach you to sit up there and make life miserable . [ laughing ] [ whooping ] [ chattering in Russian ] ( Dominic ) Who needs guns ? [ Dominic laughing ] Get in ! Get in ! [ guns firing ] [ guns continue firing ] ( pilot ) I still can 't figure Sgt. Tembrusco . He 's flown on and off as my crew chief for five years . I 've never seen him act so weird before . Maybe that 's why . I don 't follow you . Well , he knows it 's a Harrier . He just didn 't want you to lose the bet . It was not a Harrier . It was an SR-7 1 . Then why didn 't Tembrusco say so ? I don 't know . Something 's wrong . ( pilot ) This is the first flight he 's missed since- - ( Munga ) Capt. Nuzo , I have an aircraft approaching for hookup . Same bet ? You 're on . Airman , what 's your name , son ? Uh , Airman Munga , sir . What kind of aircraft is that , Munga ? Uh , type , sir ? That 's right , Airman . What type ? ( Munga ) Uh , it 's a helicopter , sir . Where 'd you get this guy ? [ birds chirping ] [ clock ticking ] I was wrong . Hmm ? What ? 0600 Zulu . Aircraft linkup with refueling tanker Tango over the Norwegian basin 0547 confirmed . [ laughing ] Hawke did it ! Yeah , try to control yourself . Yes , sir . You 're acting like a trainee on her first mission instead of ... [ whoops ] He did it ! All right . [ wind whistling ] ( Dominic ) I haven 't had halupkis since I was a kid . ( Dominic ) And my friend Milo 's mom , they were Russian , too , she made it for me . A-and then there was a special soup that she used to make for Christmas . With , uh , pasta and , uh , little meatballs . ( Natalya ) I never heard of that . ( Dominic ) Oh ? Well , maybe that was Ling Soo 's mom . They were Chinese , you know . [ all laugh ] So , uh , tell me , Mr. Rostoff , what was Michael like in the early days ? " Early days " ? You make me sound ancient . Michael , you do look a little the worse for wear . All earned in the line of duty . [ laughs ] [ speaking Russian ] ( Rostoff ) Tanya ? [ speaking Russian ] ( Archangel ) Give her time , Vlad . [ liquid pouring ] ( Marella ) Well , you haven 't answered my question . ( Marella ) Thank you . Excuse me . Well , in the beginning , Michael was a bit of a womanizer . ( Archangel ) What ? [ laughing ] ( Marella ) Do you , uh ... Have you made any plans ? ( Marella ) Now that you 're back in the United States ... [ bird cawing ] [ birds twittering ] ( Hawke ) Kind of pretty , huh ? It is not so beautiful as Russia . Yeah . From what I saw , that was a really beautiful country . Not commercial like United States . [ birds chirping ] I guess you 'll be going back . Of course . Just as soon as Mama and Papa ... I will never give up Russia . Never . Nobody is asking you to , Tanya . You can 't give up what 's in your heart . You mean I will not be forced to become American ? Well , I 'm sure there 'll be a lot of people who 'll try to Americanize you . That 's only natural . ( Hawke ) You might even find out some things about this country you like . Like what ? I don 't know . Music , books , films , fast food . [ bird chirping ] But most of all , the freedom to accept or reject our culture or our politics as you see fit . Prove it . That 's something you 'll have to find out for yourself . ¢ Ü ¢ Ü [ cello playing ]

 [ music playing ] [ mechanical whirring ] ROBOT : Stop right there . Stop right there , and surrender your weapon . The hell , you say . - [ electricity crackling ] - [ yells ] [ music swells ] [ projector whirring ] [ overlapping chatter ] Ladies and gentlemen , that concludes the film portion of our presentation . Now , I 'm sure you all have questions , so let me introduce you to the Head of Development for Secure-Tronics Unlimited , Dr. Stan Simon . [ applause ] Thank you very much . Before I open the floor , I 'd like you all to meet ... - [ crowd gasping ] - your brand-new security team , the Protector 101 Series robots . One week from tonight at closing , the Protectors will begin their patrol of the mall . Paul , they look like the Three Stooges . Each assigned to one of the three upper shopping levels . I don 't know , Mary . The one in the middle has an unpleasantly ethnic quality . Now , are there any questions ? Yes , Dr. Carrington . So what do your machines there do besides kill criminals ? Well , first of all , Doctor , the Protectors do not kill . Wonder if they kill cockroaches . They could probably be programmed to . They merely detain intruders until the computer , located on the roof , can patch into the mall phone system and send an alarm to the police . I don 't know . That guy looked awfully dead to me . Just neutralized . Protectors can achieve this function in a number of ways . At close range , sleep darts fired from here and here can knock a man out in less than 30 seconds . However , the likelihood of an intruder gaining entry is greatly minimized by the steel security doors , which are time-locked from midnight till dawn . Um , they seem so violent . If they 're called Protectors , what do they protect ? Plenty . For starters , as seen in the film , the Protectors do their work in the mall proper , not in the stores themselves . Maybe we could use one at the restaurant , get rid of people we don 't like . For instance , lasers positioned here can cut through any sort of debris . Well , that 's all very well and good , but what about those who work late ? And how can your things there distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys ? That 's very simple . Watch . This is Simon . Bring Number One online . [ whirs , hums ] - Ho ho ! - Wow ! - [ neck whirs ] - [ overlapping chatter ] That 's great stuff . May I see your identification badge , please ? It 's scanning . They remind me of your mother . It 's the laser eyes . NUMBER ONE : Thank you . Have a nice day . Same to you . There . You see ? The system is absolutely foolproof . Now , everyone connected with the mall has been issued an I.D. badge so that when the secure mechanism goes online , the Protectors will make Park Plaza the safest mall in the state . Trust me . Absolutely nothing can go wrong . [ music playing ] [ footsteps clopping ] [ music continues ] - Ahh ! - My God . Are you alright ? - More coffee ? - Come on . Come on , sweetheart ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! What do you got ? Andiamo ! Can I get two Uncle Luigi belly-busters , a double anchovy pizza , and an order of garlic logs ? That 's so gross . What Mojave brain ordered that ? Guy over there . Oh , God . I should have known . That orca beaches here every night , always trying to snag some skin . Play it safe , Alison . Serve at arm 's length , if you get my drift . Thanks for the advice . - Yeah . - [ screams ] - DINER : That 's one ! [ laughs ] - Shit . Oh , honey , you 're breakin ' my heart . [ speaking Italian ] Look , Alison , in about an hour and a half , we bail this barbecue , and it 's good times to the max . You 've just got to show . Suzie , you 've got A one-track mind . I already told you . I don 't know anybody . Yeah , but you will after tonight . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Hey , would I set you up with a slime dog or something ? No way , babe .

Dude ! - The fridge is packed . - Alright , good . Rick and Linda are bringing the food . Clean sheets are definitely waiting . And , uh , Suzie- - [ chuckles ] Suzie has a surprise for you . [ jabbering ] I don 't know , guys . Come on , Ferdy . Forget about your Uncle Sid for a while . This is gonna work , okay ? Ferdy , you can 't back out on us now . - Okay , okay , let 's party . - Alright . But first I gotta find Mrs. Flanagan 's fuchsia . I- - Well , you find Mrs. Flanagan 's fuchsia .

I covered this whole deal when I said , " For better or worse , " remember ? 'Course I remember . I mean , who could forget that 40-weight stain right there on your tux ? Should have been " for better or weird . " And speaking about weird , what about this furniture store thing- - Oh , come on , Walden . Indulge me . We haven 't had any fun since we sunk all our wedding money into the business . Besides , Suzie 's counting on us . - Honey , I don 't care about- - - Okay . Okay , okay . I guess I won 't be needing this . Or , um ... will I ? [ thunder rumbles ] [ tires squeal ] MAN , OVER P.A. : Attention , shoppers . Attention , shoppers . Park Plaza will be closed in 20 minutes .

Heh . Forget it , man . We get out of here , you owe me a six-pack . Just make sure that those cords are good and tight . Yeah . Are you sure this is gonna work ? With those things , Greg , I 'm not sure of anything . Hey , Ferdy , how 's the panel coming ? Well , the doors work now . I bypassed the circuit . But forget about going up or down . It 's controlled by the computer . Do you hear anything unusual ? Only my heartbeat . [ screaming ] [ screaming continues ] [ yelps ] It 's not stopping ! Come on ! [ screaming ] Help me ! Help me up ! Suzie ! [ screaming ] Help me ! We 've gotta help her ! Thank you , and have a nice day . [ Suzie screaming ] Oh , God . [ screaming ] - RICK : Come on ! - Fucking bastard .

According to my calculations , provided we survive the night of course ... we 're gonna be in hock to this place for the next 85 years . How many tune-ups is that ? Just a sec . [ keys tapping ] 2,900,431 . Maybe we should raise our rates . Hey , deadeye . Yo . Nice shootin ' . Thanks . Tell me one thing , though , huh ? Why did you leave the air shaft ? I mean , you were safe there . You were safe . Greg , Suzie thought you were in trouble . She just wanted to help . I 'm telling you you should 've kept her there . Look , she told you what happened . Why don 't you just leave her alone ? Shut up . You just shut the fuck up ! Hey . Do you guys mind keeping it down ? There 's another one of those things out there , and you 're gonna bring it right to us . There 's another one ? Why haven 't we seen it ? Why ? I 'll tell you why . 'Cause the fucker 's out there waiting for us . He 's waiting to pick us off one by one ! But I got news for you . He ain 't getting me . Greg , you 're not thinking , man . We got this far by staying together . And a lot of good that did Suzie , right ? Wait . Wait . I got an idea . The master computer is somewhere on the third level . We shut it down , it shuts the robots down . Well ? It 's worth a try . Computer , huh ? Let 's go trash the fucker . Come on , guys ! Let 's shake it ! RICK : Come on , buddy . Slow down .

The moment any one of us go out there , we 're dead meat , yesterday 's news . Damn it , Ferdy , will you stop it ? ! - Will you just stop it ? ! - Linda . Linda , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to upset you . I ... It 's alright . It 's not you , Ferdy . [ sighing ] I guess I 'm just not used to being chased around a mall in the middle of the night by killer robots . - [ both gasp ] - It 's in ! Yeah , and it won 't be long before it comes our way . - We 've gotta get out of here . - Not so fast . One of them could 've doubled back . We could get picked off out there . Well , look , if those things want some target practice , why don 't we give ' em some targets ? [ metal door rattling ] Get out of here ! Ferdy , now ! Rick , look out ! [ screams ] Linda ! You son of a bitch ! Rick , no ! [ groaning ] Let 's go find that computer . Where the hell is it ? Probably off one of these service corridors . There 's a million doors . We 'll never find it . Okay , why don 't you try over there ? - And I 'll try over here . - No , I don 't want to split up . - What can happen ? - You want a list ? - We 're wasting time . - Okay , look , if you even think you see anything or hear anything- - You 'll hear me .

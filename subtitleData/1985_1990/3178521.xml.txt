 Bio-readouts are in the green . Looks like she 's alive . There goes our salvage , guys . How are we today ? Oh . Terrible . Better than yesterday , at least . Where am I ? You 're safe . You 're at Gateway Station . Been here a couple of days . You were pretty groggy at first , but now you 're OK . Looks like you 've got a visitor . Jonesy ! Come here ! Hey , come here . How are you , you stupid cat ? How are you ? Where have you been ? Guess you two have met , huh ? I 'm Carter Burke . I work for the Company . Don 't let that fool you . I 'm really an OK guy . I 'm glad you 're feeling better . They tell me the weakness and disorientation should pass soon . That 's just natural side effects ... of such an unusually long hypersleep . What do you mean ? How long was I out there ? Has no one discussed this with you ? No . But , I mean , I don 't recognize this place . No , I know . Uh ... OK . This might be a shock . It 's long- - How long ? Please . Fifty-seven years . What ? You were out there for fifty-seven years . You drifted right through the core systems . It 's really just blind luck ... that a deep-salvage team found you . It 's one in a thousand , really . You 're damn lucky to be alive , kiddo . You could be floating out there forever . You OK ? Oh . Oh ! You OK ? Oh ! God ! Nurse ! Please ! Someone get in here now ! No ! Now ! - Hold-- - Please . Hold her . Kill me ! No ! No ! Bad dreams again ? You want something to help you sleep ? No . I 've slept enough . Jonesy . Come here . Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right now . It 's over . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . Been running behind all morning . Is there any word about my daughter ? Uh ... I think we should worry about the hearing now . We don 't have a lot of time . I read your deposition , and it 's great . If you stick to that , we 'll be fine . The thing is , there are gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there . Feds , lnterstellar Commerce Commission ... Colonial Administration , insurance company guys . Do you have any news about my daughter ? We did come up with some information . Why don 't we sit down ? I was hoping to wait until after the inquest . Uh ... " Amanda Ripley McClaren- - " married name , I guess- - " age sixty-six . " That was at the time of her death ... which was two years ago . I 'm real sorry . Amy . She was cremated and interred ... at Westlake Repository , Little Chute , Wisconsin . No children . I checked . I promised her ... that I would be home for her birthday . Her eleventh birthday . Ohh ... I 'd like to go back to this point ... about the override destruct elements . I don 't understand this . We have been here three and a half hours . How many different ways do you want the same story ? Look at it from our perspective , please . Please ? You freely admit to detonating the engines of ... and thereby destroying an M-Class star freighter ... a rather expensive piece of hardware . Forty-two million in adjusted dollars . That 's minus payload , of course . The lifeboat 's flight recorder ... corroborates some elements of your account ... in that , for reasons unknown ... the Nostromo set down on LV-426 ... an unsurveyed planet at that time ... that it resumed its course ... and was subsequently set for self-destruct by you ... for reasons unknown . Not for reasons unknown . I told you . We set down on Company orders to get this thing ... which destroyed my crew and your expensive ship . The analysis team ... which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter ... found no physical evidence of the creature you describe . Good ! That 's because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock . Like I said . Are there any species ... Like this hostile organism on LV-426 ? No . It 's a rock . No indigenous life . Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away ? Ma 'am , I already said it was not indigenous . It was a derelict spacecraft . It was an alien ship . It was not from there . Do you get it ? We homed in on its beacon . And found something never recorded once ... in over three hundred surveyed worlds . " A creature that gestates inside a living human host . " These are your words . " And has concentrated acid for blood . " That 's right . Look . I can see where this is going ... but I 'm telling you that those things exist . Thank you , Officer Ripley . That will be all . Please ! You 're not listening . Kane--the crew member ... Kane , who went into that ship , said he saw thousands of eggs . Thank you . That will be all . God damn it , that 's not all ! If one of those things gets down here , that will be all ! And all this bullshit you think is important ... you can kiss all that good-bye ! It is the finding of this court of inquiry ... that Warrant Officer E. Ripley ... N-O-C-one-four-four-seven-two ... has acted with questionable judgment ... and is unfit to hold an ICC license ... as a commercial flight officer . Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely . No criminal charges ... will be filed against you at this time ... and you are released on your own recognizance ... for a six-month period of psychometric probation ... to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric technician . These proceedings are closed . That could have been better . Look , I think--Ripley . Van Leuwen . Why don 't you just check out LV-426 ? Because I don 't have to . People have been there for over twenty years ... and they never complained about any hostile organism . What people ? Terraformers . Planet engineers . They go in , set up atmosphere processors ... to make the air breathable . It takes decades . It 's what we call a shake ' n ' bake colony . How many are there ? How many colonists ? I don 't know . Sixty , maybe seventy families . Do you mind ? Families . Jesus . I 'll be down in maintenance . - Al ? - What ? - Hey , Al . - What ? Remember you sent some wildcatters ... out in the middle of nowhere last week ... out past the Ilium Range ? One 's on the horn , a mom-and-pop survey team . He 's onto something , wants his claim honored . Why wouldn 't it be honored ? Because you sent them on Company orders maybe ? Christ . Some haunch in a cushy office on Earth says ... " Go look at a grid reference . " We look . They don 't say why , and I don 't ask ... because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here . The answer is always : " Don 't ask . " What do I tell this guy ? As far as I 'm concerned , if he finds something , it 's his . - Lydecker ? - What ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be here ! Get out ! You go in places we can 't fit . So ? That 's why I 'm the best ! Knock it off . If I catch you playing in the air ducts , I 'll tan your hides . Mom , all the kids play- - Wait . Have a look at this . Folks , we have scored big this time . What is it , Dad ? I 'm not sure . Let 's see if we can 't get a closer look at this thing ... maybe through that crack on the side . Shouldn 't we call in ? Let 's wait till we know what to call it in as . That 's about as close as we can get . Should we look inside ? You kids stay inside . I mean it . We 'll be right back . OK . Bye . Huh ? Timmy , they 've been gone a long time . It 'll be OK . Dad knows what he 's doing . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is Alpha Kilo Two-four - niner calling Control ! This is Alpha Kilo Two-four-niner ! Hiya , Ripley . This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps- - Ripley , we have to talk . We 've lost contact with the colony on LV-426 . I don 't believe this . You guys throw me to the wolves ... and now you want me to go back there ? Forget it . It 's not my problem . - Can I finish ? - No . There 's no way . You wouldn 't be going in with the troops . I can guarantee your safety . These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres . They 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . There 's nothing they can 't handle . Lieutenant , am I right ? We 've been trained to deal with situations like this . Then you don 't need me . I 'm not a soldier . But we don 't know exactly what 's going on . It may be a downed transmitter . But if it 's not ... I 'd like you there as an advisor , and that 's all . What 's your interest in all this ? Why are you going ? The Corporation co-financed that colony ... along with Colonial Administration . We 're getting into a lot of terraforming now ... and building better worlds- - Yeah . I saw the commercial . I don 't have time for this . I 've got to get to work . Right . I heard you 're working the cargo docks . That 's right . Running loaders and forklifts . Yeah . So ? Nothing . I think it 's great that you 're keeping busy . I know it 's the only thing you could get . There 's nothing wrong with it . What would you say if I told you ... I could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? The Company 's already agreed to pick up your contract . If I go . Yeah , if you go . Come on . That 's a second chance , kiddo . I think personally for you ... it would be the best thing to go and face this thing . Get back on the horse . Spare me . I 've had my psych evaluation . I know . I 've read it . You wake up every night , soaked in sweat- - I said no , and I mean it ! Now please leave . I am not going back ... and I would not be any good to you if I did . OK . Shh . Would you do me a favor ? Just think about it . Thanks for the coffee . Hello . Ripley . You OK ? Just tell me one thing , Burke . You 're going out there to destroy them , right ? Not to study . Not to bring back . But to wipe them out . That 's the plan . You have my word on it . All right , I 'm in . I think that- - And you , you little shithead ... you 're staying here . They ain 't paying ' us enough for this , man . Not enough to have to wake up to your face , Drake . What ? ls that a joke ? I wish it were . Hey , Hicks . Man , you look just like I feel . All right , sweethearts ... what are you waiting for , breakfast in bed ? Another glorious day in the Corps . A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm . Every meal 's a banquet , every paycheck a fortune ... every formation a parade . I love the Corps ! Man , this floor is freezing ! Want me to fetch your slippers ? Gee , would you , sir ? I 'd like that . Look into my eye . Fall in , people ! Come on , let 's go . I hate this job . Crowe , Wierzbowski , on your feet . I 'm talking about breathing , not this frozen shit . Yeah , Top , how about it ? First assembly 's in fifteen , people . Shag it . Hey , mira . Who 's Snow White ? She 's supposed to be some kind of consultant . Apparently , she saw an alien once . Whoopee-fucking-do ! Hey , I 'm impressed . Qué bonita . Hey , Vasquez . Have you ever been mistaken for a man ? No . Have you ? Ha ha ! Oh , Vasquez . You 're just too bad . Hey , Top , what 's the op ? A rescue mission . You 'll love it . There 's some juicy colonists ' daughters ... we have to rescue from their virginity . Dumbass colonists . What 's this crap supposed to be ? Cornbread , I think . It 's good for you , boy . Eat it . I wouldn 't mind getting more of that Arcturian poontang . Remember that time ? Yeah , but the one you had was a male . It doesn 't matter when it 's Arcturian . Hey , Bishop , do the thing with the knife . Oh , please . Come on . All right ! I don 't want to see that . All right ! What are you doing , man ? Quit messing around , Drake . Bishop . Hey , man . - Do it . - Hey , not me , man ! Yeah , you . Don 't move . Trust me . All right , knock it off . Thank you . Enjoy your meal . That wasn 't funny , man . Lieutenant Gorman ? Mr. Burke ? Yeah , thanks . Looks like the new lieutenant 's too good to eat with us grunts . Boy 's definitely got a corncob up his ass . I thought you never missed , Bishop . You never said anything about an android being on board . It never occurred to me . It 's common practice to have a synthetic on board . I prefer the term " artificial person . " Right . Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I didn 't even ... Ripley 's last trip , the syn- - the artificial person malfunctioned . Malfunctioned ? There were problems , and a few deaths were involved . I 'm shocked . Was it an older model ? Yeah . The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2 . That explains it . The A-2s always were a bit twitchy . That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors . It is impossible for me to harm ... or allow to be harmed a human being . Sure you don 't want some ? Just stay away from me . You got that straight ? Guess she don 't like the cornbread , either . Squad , ten-hut ! Officer on deck ! As you were . Quickly , quickly . Settle down . All right , listen up ! Good morning , Marines . I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to brief you before we left- - Sir ! What is it , Hicks ? Hudson , sir . He 's Hicks . What 's the question ? Is this gonna be a stand-up fight or another bug-hunt ? All we know is there 's still no contact with the colony ... and a xenomorph may be involved . Excuse me , sir . A what ? A xenomorph . It 's a bug-hunt . What exactly are we dealing with ? Ripley . I 'll tell you what I know . We set down on LV-426 . A crew member was brought back on board ... with something attached to his face ... some kind of parasite . We tried to get it off . It wouldn 't come off . Later , it seemed to come off by itself and die . Kane seemed fine . We were all having dinner . It must have laid something inside his throat ... some sort of embryo . He started ... Um , he- - Look , man , I only need to know one thing- - where they are . Vasquez , kick ass . Anytime , anywhere . Right . Somebody said " alien ... " she thought they said " illegal alien " and signed up . - Fuck you , man . - Anytime , anywhere . Are you finished ? I hope you 're right . I really do . Yeah , OK . Right . Thank you , Ripley . We have Ripley 's report on disk . I suggest you study it . Because just one of those things ... wiped out my crew in less than twenty-four hours . If the colonists have found that ship ... there 's no telling how many have been exposed . Do you understand ? Anyway , we have it on disk , so look at it . Any questions ? What is it , Private ? How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit ? You secure that shit , Hudson . All right . Now listen up . I want this thing to go smooth and by the numbers . I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 08.30 . Ordnance loading , weapons strip ... and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours . Now move it , people ! You heard the man , and you know the drill . Assholes and elbows ! Hudson , come here . Come here ! I don 't care if you are short , Hudson . Get it done . You 'll get lip cancer smoking those . I want this loading lock sealed . Now ! - How many more , Spunkmeyer ? - Last one . Good . Take it away . Clear behind . Did you check number three ? Hi . I feel like a fifth wheel . Is there anything I can do ? I don 't know . Is there anything you can do ? Well , I can drive that loader . I have a Class Two rating . Be my guest . Where you want it ? Bay twelve , please . We 're a team , and there 's nothing to worry about . We come here , and we gonna conquer ... and we gonna take some . Is that understood ? That 's what we gonna do . We are going to get some . All right , people , on the ready-line ! - Are you lean ? - Yeah ! - Are you mean ? - Yeah ! - What are you ? ! - Lean , mean Marines ! Get on the ready-line ! Get some today ! Get on the ready-line ! Move it out ! Move it out , God damn it ! Get hot ! One , two , three ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! Move it out ! One , two , three , four ! One , two , three ! Absolutely badasses ! Let 's pack ' em in ! Get in there ! Move it ! Let 's go , let 's go . One , two , three , four , five , six ! I want combat seating . You know your places . Get those weapons stowed . Let 's go . Come on . Settle down , people . Lock them in , Hudson . Ready to get it on ? You know it ! OK , Bishop , let 's go . Roger . I 'm ready , man . Ready to get it on ! Go ! Stand by . Cross-locking now . Pre-launch auto-cycle engage . Primary couplers released . Hit the internals . Oh , shit , man . Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured . Affirmative . All drop stations secured . Stand by . Ten seconds . Stand by to initiate release sequencer ... on my mark . We 're on an express elevator to hell . Going down ! Two , one , mark . Whoo-hoo ! Switch to DCS ranging . Two-four-oh , nominal to profile . We 're in the pipe , five by five . We 're picking up some hull ionization . Got it . Rough air ahead . We 're in for some chop . How many drops is this for you , Lieutenant ? Thirty-eight . Simulated . How many combat drops ? Uh , two ... including this one . Shit . Oh , man . Range zero-one-four . Turning on final . I got a bad feeling about this drop . You always say , " l got a bad feeling about this drop . " When we get back without you , I 'll call your folks . All right . Let 's see what we can see . Everybody on-line . Looking good . Drake , check your camera . There seems to be a malfunction . That 's better . Pan it around a bit . Good . I 'm ready . Check it out . I am the ultimate badass . State of the badass art . You do not wanna fuck with me . Check it out . Hey , Ripley , don 't worry . Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you . Check it out . Independently targeting particle-beam phalanx . Whap ! Fry half a city with this puppy . We got tactical smart missiles ... phase-plasma pulse-rifles , RPGs . We got sonic , electronic ballbreakers ! We got nukes . We got knives , sharp sticks- - Knock it off , Hudson ! All right , gear up . Two minutes , people . Get hot . Somebody wake up Hicks . Coming around for a seven-zero-niner . Terminal guidance locked in . Where 's the damn beacon ? Oh , I see it . That 's the atmosphere processor ? Yep , that 's it . Remarkable piece of machinery . Completely automated . We manufacture those , by the way . OK , Ferro . Take us in low over the main colony complex . Storm shutters are sealed . There 's no visible activity . All right . Hold at forty . Roger . Give me a slow circle of the complex . Structure seems intact . They still have power . OK , Ferro . Set down on the landing grid . Immediate dust-off on my clear , then stay on station . Down and clear . Ten seconds , people . Look sharp ! I want a nice , clean dispersal this time . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Head ' em out ! First squad up , on-line . Hicks , get yours in a cordon , and watch the rear . Vasquez , take point . Let 's move ! Move up . Hudson , run a bypass . Second squad , move up . Flanking positions . Second squad , on-line . You set ? Second team , move inside . Hicks , take the upper level . Sir , you copying this ? Looks like hits from small-arms fire . We got some explosives damages , probably seismic survey charges . Are you reading this ? Keep it tight , people . Hicks , Hudson , use your motion trackers . Nothing . Not a goddamn thing . Quarter and search by twos . OK , Dietrich , Frost , you 're up . It 's right in here . - Now ! - Now ! Hyah ! Good one , Hudson . Uh , sir , we have a negative situation here . Uh , moving on , sir . Wait . Wait , tell him to ... Hicks , back up . Pan right . There . You seeing this all right ? Looks melted . Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley 's bad guys here . Acid for blood . If you like that , you 're gonna love this . Quit screwing around . Second squad , what 's your status ? We just finished our sweep . Nobody 's home . Roger . Sir , this place is dead . Whatever happened here , we missed it . The area 's secured . Let 's go check their computer . - It 's not secure . - The area 's secured . First team , head for Operations . Hudson , get their CPU on-line . Affirmative . Hicks , meet me at the south lock . We 're coming in . He 's coming in . I feel safer already . Pendejo jerkoff . Sir , we got the CPU on-line . No problem . Good . Stand by in Operations . OK , let 's go . Are you all right ? Yes . Sir ... they sealed off this wing at both ends , welded the doors ... and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment . But it looks like the barricade didn 't hold . - Any bodies ? - No , sir . Last stand . Must have been a hell of a fight . Looks that way . All right , Drake , this way . We should be able to cut through the med lab to Operations . Lieutenant . Gorman . Are those the same ones ? Careful , Burke . Looks like love at first sight to me . Oh , he likes you , Burke . Two are alive . The rest are dead . " Surgically removed before embryo implantation . " Subject Marachuk , John J. , died during the procedure . " They killed him taking it off . Yo , Hicks . I think we got something here . Behind us . One of us ? Apone , where are your people ? Anybody in D-Block ? Negative . We 're all in Operations . Talk to me , Frosty . Let 's keep moving , baby . It 's moving . Which way ? It 's coming straight for us . Straight up . Fuck ! Hold up . Ripley . Hey , shh , it 's all right . It 's all right . Grab her , Corporal . Don 't be afraid . Come on . We won 't hurt you . Shh . It 's all right . It 's OK . Come on out . Come on . Easy . I got her . Ow ! Damn ! Don 't let her go . She 's under the grill ! Frost , get your light up here . Where 'd she go ? She 's on the other side . Shine the light ! Here . Here . Keep back . Don 't scare her . Grab her . We 're gonna lose her . Damn it ! Wait . It 's OK . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . See ? Wait . No , you don 't . It 's OK . You 're gonna be all right now . Shh . Easy . Easy . It 's gonna be OK . It 's all right . You 're gonna be OK . Shh , shh , shh . Easy . Easy . What 's her name again ? Rebecca . Now think , Rebecca . Concentrate . Just start at the beginning . Where are your parents ? Look , Rebecca , you have to try- - Gorman , give it a rest , why don 't you ? Total brainlock . Physically , she 's OK . Borderline malnutrition , but no permanent damage . Come on . We 're wasting time . Try this . It 's a little hot chocolate . There you go . Whoop . That good , huh ? Uh-oh . I made a clean spot here . Now I 've done it . Guess I 'll have to do the whole thing . Hard to believe there 's a little girl under all this . And a pretty one , too . You don 't talk much , do you ? Smoking or non-smoking ? Tell me what you 're scanning for . PDTs . Personal data transmitters . Every colonist had one surgically implanted . If they 're within twenty klicks , we 'll read it out here . So far , zippo . I don 't know how you stayed alive ... but you 're one brave kid , Rebecca . Newt . What 'd you say ? Newt . My name 's Newt . Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother . Newt . I like that . I 'm Ripley . It 's nice to meet you . And who is this , hmm ? Casey . Hello , Casey . What about your brother ? What 's his name ? Timmy . Is Timmy around here , too ? Maybe hiding like you were ? Any sisters ? Mom and Dad ? Newt , look at me . Where are they ? They 're dead , all right ? Can I go now ? I 'm sorry , Newt . Don 't you think you 'd be safer here with us ? These people are here to protect you . They 're soldiers . It won 't make any difference . Need anything else ? Hello , Bishop . Do you need anything else ? No . Nice pet you got there . Magnificent , isn 't it ? Yo ! Stop your grinnin and drop your linen ! Found them . They alive ? Unknown , but it looks like all of them ... over at the processing station ... sub-level three ... under the main cooling towers . It looks like a goddamn town meeting . Let 's saddle up , Apone . Aye , sir . Let 's go . They ain 't paying ' us by the hour . Head ' em out . OK , Frost , you 're driving . It 's OK . Don 't worry . It 'll be OK . I want a straight " V " deployment ... second team on left flank . Advance on axial six-six-four . Tracker on-line . Set the V-gain to filter R-F ambient . Hudson , tracker on-line . Left and right , little buddy . Forty meters in , bearing two-two-one ... there should be a stairwell . Check . Got it . You want sub-level three . Let 's go , people . Hudson , you got the point . Hicks , watch our tails . Nice and easy . Check those corners . Check those corners . Watch your spacing . You heard the man . Don 't bunch up . Stay loose . Your transmission 's showing a lot of break-up . Probably getting some interference from the structure . Use those lights . Next one down , and proceed on a two-one-six . Roger . That 's a two-one-six . I 'm not making that out too well . What is it , Hudson ? You tell me . I only work here . What is that ? I don 't know . Proceed inside . Watch your fire and check your targets . Remember , we 're looking for civvies in here . Easy . Tighten it up , Frost . We 're getting a little thin . Nice and easy . Looks like some sort of secreted resin . Yeah , but secreted from what ? Nobody touch nothing . Busy little creatures , huh ? Hot as hell in here . But it 's a dry heat . Knock it off , Hudson . Lieutenant , what do those pulse-rifles fire ? Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless . Standard light armor-piercing round . Why ? Look where your team is . They 're right under the primary heat exchangers . So ? So if they fire their weapons in there ... won 't they rupture the cooling system ? Oh , ho ho . Yeah . She 's absolutely right . So what ? This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor . Right ? So she 's talking about a thermonuclear explosion ... and , " Adiós , muchachos . " Oh , great . Wonderful . Shit ! Look . Uh ... Apone . We can 't have any firing in there . I want you to collect magazines from everybody . Is he fuckin ' crazy ? What do we use , harsh language ? Flame units only . I want rifles slung . Sir , I- - Just do it , Sergeant . And no grenades . You heard the man . Pull ' em out . Let 's have ' em . Come on , Vasquez . Clear and lock . Damn ! You , too . Give it up , Ski . Crowe , I want it now . Give it up . Right on , Vas . Let 's go . Give it up . Frost , you got the duty . Open that bag . Thanks a lot , Sarge . Hicks , cover our ass . Head ' em out , people . I like to keep this handy for close encounters . I heard that . Any movement ? Nothing . Zip . Holy shit . Newt , go sit up front . Go on ! Now ! Steady , people . Let 's finish our sweep . We 're still Marines , and we got a job to do . Keep it moving . Easy . - Top ! - What ? We got a live one ! You 're gonna be all right . Please ... kill me . Stay calm . We 'll get you out . It 's gonna be all right . We 've got to get her out of here . What is it , Dietrich ? What 's going on ? Convulsion ! Ohh ! Dietrich , get back ! No ! Frost , flamethrower ! Get back ! Flamethrower ! Move ! What 's the position ? I can 't lock in ! Talk to me , Hudson ! Multiple signals . They 're closing . Go to infrared , people . Look sharp ! What 's happening , Apone ? We can 't see anything in here . Pull your team out , Gorman . I got readings in front and behind . Where , man ? I don 't see shit . He 's right . Nothing 's back here . Something 's moving , and it ain 't us ! Oh , shit . Tracker 's off-scale , man . They 're all around us , man ! Jesus ! Maybe they don 't show up on infrared at all . Frost ! Come on ! Jesus Christ , Apone ! What is going on ? Wierzbowski and Crowe are down ! Dietrich , Crowe ! Sound off ! Frost ! Frost ! Wierzbowski ! Wierzbowski ! Let 's rock ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Who 's firing ? God damn it ! Yeah ! I ordered a hold fire . They 're coming out of the goddamn walls ! Let 's book ! Uh , Apone ... I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with ... Vasquez , Drake , hold your fire , God damn it ! GORMAN : Are you copying me ? Lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators ... and fall back by squads ... Say again ? All after " incinerator " . Lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators ... and fall back ... Sarge ! Apone , talk to me . Apone ? Talk to me ! He 's gone ! Get them out of there ! Shut up ! Hicks , whoever 's left , get the hell- - - Shut up ! - God damn it ! Where 's Apone ? ! Where 's Apone ? ! The Sarge is gone ! Let 's get the fuck out of here ! Let 's go , Marines ! Hudson ? Vasquez ? Hudson , look out ! Get it ! Hudson ! Hicks ! Hicks ! It 's too much ! Fall back ! I told them to fall back . I told them to fall back . They 're cut off ! Do something ! Fuck ! Keep movin ' ! Hold on , Newt . Ripley , what the hell are you doing ? Turn around ! That 's an order ! Get off me , damn it ! God damn it , that 's an order ! You had your chance , Gorman . Come on ! Come on , Drake ! Yeah ! Let 's move it ! Come on . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! It 's blocked , man . We got to go around ! Open the door ! Hicks ! Drake , we are leaving ! Run for it ! Shit ! Let 's go ! Drake , come on , man ! Drake , come on ! No ! Fire in the hall ! He 's gone ! No ! Drake 's out there ! Put it out ! Drake 's coming ! He 's gone ! No , he 's not ! Forget him ! He 's gone ! Get on the goddamn door ! Eat this ! Aah ! Ripley ! Go , go , go ! Ripley , you 've blown the transaxle ! You 're just grinding metal ! Come on , ease down . Ease down . Ease down . Ease down . You OK ? I 'm all right . Get away from me , man ! Lieutenant . What happened to Gorman ? I don 't know ... maybe a concussion , but he 's alive . No , man , he 's dead ! Wake up , pendejo ! I 'm going to kill you ! Back off . Right now . Somebody get me a first aid kit . Hey . Hey , look . The Sarge and Dietrich aren 't dead , man . Their signs are real low , but they ain 't dead . Then we get them . - We don 't leave people behind ! - I ain 't going back ! You can 't help them ! You can 't . Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . Oh , dear Lord Jesus , this ain 't happening ' , man . God damn it . This can 't be happenin ' , man . This isn 't happening ' ! We 've got seven canisters of CN-20 . I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole nest . It 's worth a try , but we don 't know if it 'll affect them . Let 's bug out and call it even . Why even talk about it ? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Fuckin ' " A " ! Hold on one second . This installation has a substantial dollar value . They can bill me . OK , look . This is an emotional moment for all of us , OK ? I know that . But let 's not make snap judgments , please . This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with ... and I don 't think you or I or anybody has the right ... to arbitrarily exterminate them . Wrong . Yeah . Watch us . Maybe you haven 't been keeping up on current events ... but we just got our asses kicked , pal ! I 'm not blind to what 's going on ... but I cannot authorize that kind of action . I 'm sorry . Well , I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here . Corporal Hicks is ... This operation is under military jurisdiction . Hicks is next in chain of command , right , Corporal ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . Look , Ripley ... this is a multimillion dollar installation , OK ? He can 't make that decision . He 's just a grunt . Uh , no offense . None taken . Ferro , do you copy ? Standing by . Prep for dust-off . We need immediate evac . Roger . On our way . I say we take off , nuke the site from orbit . It 's the only way to be sure . Let 's do it . Let 's go . Pick it up , Hudson . Pick it up , baby . All right . Set him down here . Move it , Spunkmeyer . We 're rolling . Hold on a second . There 's something- - Just get up here . I 'm in . Ramp closing . Spunkmeyer . God damn it . Well , where the fuck- - Run ! Well , that 's great . That 's just fuckin ' great , man . Now what the fuck are we supposed to do ? We 're in some real pretty shit now , man ! Are you finished ? You all right ? I guess we 're not gonna be leaving now , right ? I 'm sorry , Newt . You don 't have to be sorry . It wasn 't your fault . That 's it , man . Game over , man ! Game over ! What the fuck are we gonna do now ? What are we gonna do ? Maybe we could build a fire , sing a couple of songs . Why don 't we try that ? We 'd better get back 'cause it 'll be dark soon ... and they mostly come at night . Mostly . That 's everything , right ? This is absolutely everything we could salvage ... out of the APC wreckage . We got four pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each . That ain 't so good . We got fifteen of these M-40 grenades . Don 't touch that . Dangerous , honey . Is that the only flamethrower ? Yeah . It 's only half-full , but it 's functional . And another one 's damaged . I don 't know about that one . But the good news ... we got four of these robot sentries ... with display and scanners intact . They really kick ass . They 'll come in handy . How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? Seventeen days . Seventeen days ? Hey , man , I don 't wanna rain on your parade ... but we 're not gonna last seventeen hours . Those things are gonna come here like they did before , and- - Hudson ! Hudson ! This little girl survived longer than that ... with no weapons and no training . Right ? Why don 't you put her in charge ? You better just start dealing with it , Hudson . Deal with it , because we need you ... and I 'm sick of your bullshit . Now get on a terminal and call up a floor plan file . Construction blueprints . I don 't care . Anything that shows the layout . - Are you listening ? - Yeah . I need to see air ducts , electrical access tunnels ... sub-basements ... every possible way into this complex . We don 't have much time . OK . OK , I 'm on it . Hudson ! Just relax . I 'll be in med lab . I 'll check on Gorman , continue my analysis . Fine . You do that . This service tunnel ... must be how they 're moving back and forth . That 's right . It moves from the processing station ... right into the sub-level . Come down on that . OK , come over . Hold it . Go back . Punch that in there . No . It 's back here . OK . There 's a pressure door at this end . Couldn 't we put a remote sentry unit in the tunnel ... then seal that door ? That 'll work ... but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex . That 's right , so ... we repair the barricades at these two intersections ... Right . ... and weld plate steel over these ducts here and here ... and here . Then they can only come at us from these two corridors . Right . Then we put the other sentry units here ... and here , right ? - Right . - Outstanding . Now all we need is a deck of cards . Let 's move like we 've got a purpose . Affirmative . Affirmative . Do your thing , baby . Come on , Vasquez , let 's get out of here . " A " and " B " sentries are in place and keyed . Roger . Stand by . Arming now . Test it , Hudson . - Do it . - Fire in the hall ! Great . Let 's get the hell out of here . We 're sealing the tunnel . Come on , baby . For what it 's worth . I want you to put this on . What 's it for ? It 's a locator . Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this . It 's just a precaution . Thanks . Doesn 't mean we 're engaged or anything . All right , what 's next ? Last stop . Get in . Scoot down . That 's good . Now lie here and have a nap . You 're very tired . I don 't want to . I have scary dreams . Well , I bet Casey doesn 't have scary dreams . Let 's take a look . Nope . Nothing bad in there . See ? Maybe you could just try to be like her . Ripley , she doesn 't have bad dreams ... because she 's just a piece of plastic . Right . I 'm sorry , Newt . There . My mommy always said there were no monsters ... no real ones , but there are . Yes , there are , aren 't there ? Why do they tell little kids that ? Most of the time it 's true . Did one of those things grow inside her ? I don 't know , Newt . That 's the truth . Isn 't that how babies come- - I mean , people babies ? They grow inside you . No . That 's very different . Did you ever have a baby ? Yes , I did . I had a little girl . Where is she ? She 's gone . You mean dead . Here . Take this . For luck . How 's that ? Don 't go , please . Newt , I 'm gonna be right in the next room . And you see that camera ? I can see you through that camera ... to see if you 're safe . I 'm not gonna leave you , Newt . I mean that . That 's a promise . You promise ? I cross my heart . And hope to die ? And hope to die . Now go to sleep ... and don 't dream . Sneak . The molecular acid oxidizes ... after the creature 's death , completely neutralizing it . Bishop , that 's interesting , but it gets us nowhere . I 'm trying to figure out what we 're dealing with . Let 's go through it again . They grab the colonists , they move them over there ... and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these . Which means there would have to be a lot of these parasites . One for each colonist . That 's over a hundred , at least . Yes . That follows . Each one of these things comes from an egg , right ? So who 's laying these eggs ? I 'm not sure . It must be something we haven 't seen yet . Hey , maybe it 's like an ant hive . - Bees have hives . - You know what I mean . There 's , like , one female that runs the whole show . Yes . The queen . Yeah . The mama . And she 's badass , man . I mean big . - These things ain 't ants . - I know that . Bishop , I want these specimens destroyed ... as soon as you 're finished with them . Mr. Burke gave instructions ... they were to be kept alive for return to the Company labs . He was very specific about it . Those two specimens are worth millions ... to the bio-weapons division . If you 're smart , we can both come out of this heroes ... and we will be set up for life . You 're crazy , Burke . Do you know that ? Do you think you can get a dangerous organism ... past ICC quarantine ? How can they impound it if they don 't know about it ? But they will know about it , Burke . From me . Just like they 'll know you were responsible ... for the deaths of one hundred fifty-seven colonists . Wait a second ! - You sent them to that ship . - You 're wrong . I just checked the colony log ... directive dated 6-12-79 , signed Burke , Carter J. You sent them out there and didn 't even warn them . Why didn 't you warn them , Burke ? What if that ship didn 't even exist ? Did you think about that ? I didn 't know . So if I made a major security situation out of it ... everybody steps in ... and there 's no exclusive rights for anybody . Nobody wins . I made a decision , and it was wrong . It was a bad call , Ripley . Bad call ? These people are dead , Burke ! Haven 't you any idea what you 've done ? I 'm gonna make sure they nail you right to the wall . You 're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one . Right to the wall . Ripley . You know , I expected more from you . I thought you 'd be smarter than this . I 'm happy to disappoint you . What 's going on ? They 're coming . - Where ? - In the tunnel . Here we go . " A " and " B " gun tracking and firing . Multiple targets . Look at those ammo counters go . " B " gun 's down 50 percent . Man , it 's a shooting gallery down there . Sixty rounds left on " B " . Forty ... twenty ... ten . " B " gun 's dry . Twenty on " A " . Ten ... five ... That 's it . Jesus . They 're wall-to-wall in there . They 're at the pressure door . Man , listen to that . Bishop here . I 'm afraid I have some bad news . Well , that 's a switch . It 's very pretty , but what are we looking for ? That 's it . Emergency venting . That 's beautiful , man . That beats it all . How long till it blows ? Four hours ... with a blast radius of thirty kilometers ... equal to about forty megatons . We got problems . I don 't fucking believe this ! Vasquez , close the shutters . Why can 't we shut it down from here ? The crash caused too much damage . An overload was inevitable at this point . Oh , man , I was getting short . Four more weeks and out . Now I 'm going to buy it on this rock . Give us a break ! Four more weeks . Oh , man . We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco . Can 't we bring it down on remote ? The transmitter was on the APC . It 's wasted . I don 't care how . We better think of a way . Think of what ? We 're fucked ! We 're doomed ! Shut up ! What about the colony transmitters ? The uplink tower at the other end ? The hard-wiring between here and there was damaged . We can 't align the dish . Somebody 's gonna have to go out there ... take a portable terminal and patch in manually . Yeah , sure . With those things running around ? You can count me out . We can count you out of everything . I 'll go . You go , man . What ? I 'll go . I 'm the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship . Yeah , right , man . Bishop should go . Good idea . Believe me , I 'd prefer not to . I may be synthetic , but I 'm not stupid . How long ? This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly- - one hundred eighty meters . Say forty minutes crawling there ... an hour to patch in and align the antenna ... thirty minutes to prep the ship ... and about fifty minutes flight time . It 's gonna be close . Good luck . See you soon . Watch your fingers . Oh . Vaya con Dios , man . This is unbelievable . Twenty meters and closing . Fifteen . How many ? Can 't tell . Lots . " D " gun 's down 50 percent . " C " gun 's right behind it . It ain 't stopping ' em . Jesus , it ain 't stopping ' em . A hundred and fifty rounds on " D " . Come on , baby . Come on . One hundred rounds . Come on , come on . " D " gun 's down to twenty . Ten . Damn it ! Wait ! They 're retreating . The guns stopped them . You 're right . Next time they walk right up and knock . Yeah , but they don 't know that . They 're probably looking for other ways to get in . That 'll take ' em a while . - Maybe we got ' em demoralized . - Shut up . I want you two walking perimeter . Move ! Hey , listen . We 're all in strung-out shape ... but stay frosty and alert . We can 't afford to let one of those bastards in here . All right . Vámonos . How long 's it been since you got any sleep ? Twenty-four hours ? Hicks , I 'm not gonna end up like those others . You 'll take care of it , won 't you ? If it comes to that , I 'll do us both . Let 's just make sure it doesn 't come to that , all right ? All right . Hey , I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine . This is an M-41A pulse-rifle , ten millimeter ... with an over-and-under 30 millimeter grenade launcher . Feel the weight . OK , what do I do ? Pull it in tight here . - Right . - Lean into it . All right , it will kick some . When the counter reads zero here , you ... - I press this up ? - That 's right . Get another one in quick . Slap it in hard . Now you 're ready to rock ' n ' roll . - What 's this ? - The grenade launcher . I don 't think you want to mess with that . You started this . Show me everything . I can handle myself . Yeah , I noticed . How do you feel ? All right , I guess . One hell of a hangover . Look , Ripley , I just want- - Forget it . Excuse me . Shh , shh , shh . It 's OK . It 's OK . Newt . Wake up . - What ? - Be quiet . We 're in trouble . - No ! - Aah ! Move , Newt ! Hey ! Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Say again , Bishop ? You 've got it into auto-refuel mode ... and it 's sequencing right ? That 's right . Good . Stay on it . Get back to me when you 've activated the launch cycle . He 's at the uplink tower . Terrific . - Hicks ! Hicks ! - Help ! Help ! Hicks ! Help us ! Break the glass ! Break it , break it . I 'll try . Ripley , I 'm scared . Me , too . Stay here . It 's the med lab . Hudson ! Vasquez ! Meet me in med lab . We got a fire . We 're on our way . They 're coming , Newt . Oh , please . Shoot it out ! - Hudson ! - Jesus ! Christ , kid , look out ! Fucking die ! - Over there ! - Yeah ! - Ready ? - Yeah ! Hudson ! Yeah , all clear . Nailed the other one . It 's history , man . Jesus . Burke . It was Burke . I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now . It just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . He figured that he could get an alien ... back through quarantine if one of us was impregnated ... whatever you call it- - and then frozen for the trip home . Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying ... me and Newt . Wait , now . We 'd all know . Yes . He could only do it by sabotaging certain freezers ... on the way home , namely yours . He could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . Fuck ! He 's dead . You 're dog meat , pal . This is so nuts . Listen to what you 're saying . It 's paranoid delusion . It 's really sad . It 's pathetic . Burke , I don 't know which species is worse . They don 't fuck each other over for a goddamn percentage . All right , we waste him . No offense . No , he 's got to go back- - They cut the power . What do you mean " they " cut the power ? They 're animals . I want you two with trackers checking the corridors ! Move ! - Gorman , watch Burke . - I got him . Newt , stay close . - I 'll go this side . - You do that , man . Anything ? There 's something . - It 's inside the complex . You 're just reading me . - No , it ain 't you . They 're inside the perimeter . They 're in here . Hudson , stay cool . Vasquez ? Hudson may be right . Get back . The signal 's weird . Must be some interference or something . There 's movement all over the place . Get back to Operations . It 's game time . Newt . Seal the door . Hurry ! Come on . Come on , get back . Work fast . Cover your eyes , Newt . Don 't look at the light . Movement . Signal 's clean . Range , twenty meters . They found a way in , something we missed . We didn 't miss anything . HUDSON : Eighteen . Seventeen meters . Something under the floor , not in the plans . - Fifteen meters . - Ripley ! Definitely inside the barricades . Let 's go . That 's right outside the door . Get back ! This is a big fucking signal . - How you doing , Vasquez ? - Almost there . That 's it . Twelve meters . Eleven . Ten . - They 're right on us . - Nine meters . Remember- - short , controlled bursts . Eight meters . Seven . Six . - That 's inside the room . - It 's reading right ! You 're not reading it right . Five meters , man . Four . What the hell ? Oh , my God . Give me the light . Aah ! There they go ! Get them ! - Come on ! - Get them ! Do something , Gorman ! Look out ! Look out ! Look out ! There 's more of them ! Medical ! Get to medical ! Do it ! Now ! Hudson , look out ! Now ! Burke ! Open this door ! Burke ! Open it ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Fall back ! Go ! Die , you bastards ! Die , motherfucker ! Burke ! Hudson ! Hudson ! Motherfucker ! Come on ! Come on ! Come and get it , baby ! I don 't got all day ! Come on , you bastard ! Come on ! You , too ! You want some of this ? Fuck you ! Aah ! Fuck you ! - Hicks ! - Hudson ! Come on , Hicks , go ! It 's locked ! Got it ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! - Move , Gorman ! - Seal it ! Burke ! God damn you ! Open this door ! Get back . Hurry up . Gorman , get out of the way ! Ripley , this way . Wait . Get behind me . Whatever you do , do it fast . - Hicks ! - Come on , let 's go . Move ! - Which way to the landing field ? - This way . Go right . This way . - Which way ? - Straight ahead and left . Bishop , do you read me ? Come in . Over . The ship is on its way . ETA , sixteen minutes . Stand by there . We 're on our way . - Which way now ? - That way . - No , wait . This way . - You sure ? Vasquez , move ! - Right up here . - Hicks ! - We 're almost there . - Newt , wait ! Newt ! Vasquez ! Go ! Ohh ! Oh , no ! Newt . Up there , there 's a shortcut across the roof . Hicks . You always were an asshole , Gorman . Aah ! Newt ! - Ripley ! - Newt ! Hicks , get her ! Hurry ! Oh ! Hold on , Newt ! - I 'm slipping ! - Don 't let go ! - Ripley ! - Hold on . - Help ! - Got you . I got you . Aah ! Newt ! No ! Come on . We can find her with this . Stay where you are , Newt . - Ripley ! - We 're coming . Ripley ! This way . - She 's close . - Newt ! Ripley ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? - Newt ! - Here ! I 'm here ! Where ? Newt , are you OK ? Gonna have to cut it . Climb down , honey . We 've got to cut through . Newt ? Now , don 't move . Stay very still . OK . We 're almost there . Hang in there , OK ? Hicks . Hurry . - I know . - I mean it ! Newt , just stay still . Aah ! Almost there . No ! Newt ! No ! No ! - Let 's go . - No ! They don 't kill you ! They don 't kill you ! She 's alive ! She 's alive ! All right , I believe you . She 's alive . We 've got to go . Now ! - Hicks . - Get it off ! Aah ! Get it off ! Aah ! Here . Go . Come on , you can make it ! Bishop , how much time ? Plenty . Twenty-six minutes . - We 're not leaving . - We 're not ? Ripley- - I don 't want to hear about it . She 's alive . In 19 minutes , this area is gonna be a cloud of vapor ... the size of Nebraska . - Don 't let him leave . - We ain 't going anywhere . - See you , Hicks . - Dwayne . It 's Dwayne . Ellen . Don 't be gone long , Ellen . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have fifteen minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have fourteen minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Ripley ! Ripley ! Grab on to me ! Hold on ! Let 's go ! Behind us ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have four minutes to reach minimum safe distance . Come on , God damn it ! Hold on to me ! Attention . Emergency . All personnel must evacuate immediately . You now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance . No . Bishop , God damn you ! Close your eyes , baby . Look ! Come on ! Come on ! Punch it , Bishop ! It 's OK . We 're OK . Hey . We made it . I knew you 'd come . He 's gonna be all right . He 's just out . I had to give him another shot for the pain . We need a stretcher to carry him up to medical . OK . I 'm sorry if I scared you . That platform was becoming too unstable . I had to circle and hope things didn 't get too rough ... to take you off . Bishop ... you did OK . I did ? Oh , yeah . Go ! Move ! No ! Here ! Here ! Run ! Here ! Get away from her , you bitch ! Come on ! Come on ! Ripley ! Bishop ! - Mommy . - Oh , God ! Not bad for a human . Are we gonna sleep all the way home ? All the way home . Can I dream ? Yes , honey . I think we both can . - Sleep tight . - Affirmative .

 This is so beautiful . WYATT : You know it , Gary . Look at her . Do you know what I would like to do ? Shower with them . Then bang ! We hit the city , baby , dead on . For little drinks , a little nightlife , a little dancing . Dancing . We throw a huge party , I mean , huge party . Everybody 's invited , women everywhere . All these girls , they 're all there . Naked bodies everywhere . Gary . They all know my name . Gary . What ? Nobody likes us . Nobody . Why are you messing with the fantasy ? We know about the reality . Don 't ruin the fantasy , okay ? And then , we 're a hit , man . We 're popular . We 're revered . Man , we 're studs . ( SNIGGERS ) When the smoke clears , right , those two dames fall amazingly , completely and totally in love with us , Wyatt . Check it out . IAN : Yo ! Check this out . ( HEART POUNDING ) Look , we 're sorry about ... ( POP MUSIC PLAYING ) MAN ON TV : His insane ambition to create life . Where 'd your parents go , anyway ? Cincinnati . They 're meeting the guy that my sister wants to marry . Chloe ? Who the hell would marry Chloe ? He 's studying to be a vet . WYATT : Try not to make a mess in there , Gary . The maid doesn 't come till Monday . You know , I don 't understand something , Wyatt . How come all of a sudden your parents trust you , man ? They never let you do shit before . Chet 's coming home from college for the weekend . They trust him . He 's in charge . GARY : Chet ? Shit ! You know , I can 't believe this , Wyatt . I really wish that you told me this before I agreed to sleep over . You know how I feel about Chet . GARY : I mean , how do you put up with that guy ? If I don 't , he beats the shit out of me . It 's a habit he picked up in military school . GARY : I mean , how do you put up with that putz ? WYATT : What can I say , Gary ? He 's very protective of me . Nice relationship . MAN ON TV : There you have his mad dream . Look ! There 's nothing to fear . Look , no blood , no decay , just a few stitches . Go on . Fix the electrodes . You 'll have plenty to be afraid of before the night 's over . The storm will be magnificent . All the electrical secrets of heaven . And this time we 're ready . Hey , Fritz ? Let 's have one final test . Throw the switches . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Here in this machine , I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world . And , look , here 's the final touch . The brain you stole , Fritz . Think of it . The brain of a dead man waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands . You know , that 's not a bad idea . WYATT : What ? In 15 minutes , the storm should be at its height . Making a girl . Actually making a girl . Just like Frankenstein , except cuter . Nobody must come here ! Don 't touch it ! I 'm sorry , Doctor . You 're serious . Yes . Look me in the eyes . Do I look serious ? MAN : You 're crazy ! Crazy , am I ? We 'll see whether I 'm crazy or not . Gary Wallace , that 's absolutely gross . That 's sick . I 'm not digging up dead girls . It 's ... No , I 'm not talking about digging up a dead girl , Wyatt . I 'm talking about your system , idiot . Your computer . Okay , look , you know how you 're always talking about how you can simulate all that stuff on your computer ? You know ? What 's the difference ? Why can 't we simulate a girl ? I don 't know . I guess I could , but why ? It 's two-dimensional on the screen . It 's not flesh and blood , Gary . I know that , but , you know , we can use it , Wyatt . We can ask it questions . We can put it in real-life sexual situations and see how it reacts . Like real sick , demented shit . You 'd love it . Well , what about your girl in Canada ? She lives in Canada . This girl has no morals . You know , I don 't like that in a girl . It 's rough having those kind of relationships . You 'll see . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Anyway , get to work . Very nice . Hold it , Wyatt . I mean , if there 's one thing I know , it 's female stats . I mean , anything bigger than a handful , you 're risking a sprained tongue . You know , and ... Yeah . Yeah . Perfect . Okay . Now what ? Should we give her a brain ? Yeah . We can play chess with her . Chess ? Just give her a brain , okay ? Okay , that 's about all we can do with my stuff . I can 't believe this shit . I can 't believe this . Did you get a free toaster with this , too ? Gary , it 's smarter than you , okay ? The problem is , this is a lame idea , okay ? It 's not a lame idea . The problem is your computer 's a wimp and we need a lot more power than this . That 's the problem . What do you suggest ? VOICE : We have code penetration , we have program entry . I repeat , we have code penetration , we have program entry . Activate lang trace . ( SCREAMING ) We 're in . We 're in trouble , Gary . This is highly illegal . Well , you need more input . We got to fill this thing up with data . We gotta make her as real as possible , Wyatt . I want her to live , I want her to breathe . I want her to aerobicize . It 's live ! All Dave , all night ! We know what you need only right here on Dave TV ! Look at this . It 's moving , it 's working . It 's doing itself . It 's working by itself . ( CHANTING ) Gary ... ( HUMMING ) By the way , why are we wearing bras on our heads ? Ceremonial . You ready ? Yeah . Let 's go . GARY : Turn it off ! WYATT : It is off ! ( ALARM RINGING ) Hang up the phone !

( DOOR CREAKING ) ( BOTH EXCLAIMING ) WYATT : Shit ! One , two , three . She 's alive . Alive ! ( EXCLAIMING ) So , what would you little maniacs like to do first ? You guys created me . I didn 't come from anywhere . WOMAN : Before you started messing around with your computer , I didn 't even exist . By the way , you did an excellent job . Thank you . Hello ? Showering 's real fun , isn 't it ? If we 're going to have any kind of fun together , you guys had better loosen up . What are we going to do with her ? Look , we 'll just go with the situation , okay ? And I 'm sure by Sunday , you 'll think of something . You 're a very bright guy . I have a lot of faith in you , okay ? All right ? I 'm just being practical . Well , I know you are , okay ? And I appreciate it . Let 's go . What are we going to do about this mess ? Wyatt , you 'll have plenty of time to clean up tomorrow , okay ? Okay , but don 't get any b.o. On Chet 's suit , or he 'd kill me . Where are we going , anyway ? I don 't know . She said we 're going to go downtown and ... Oh , my God ! Whose stuff is this ? Is that your suit ? Wait , is this yours ? Oh , shit . Holy shit . Gary , I don 't know what 's going ... Why ? What 's going on here ? I don 't know . What is going on here ? Gary , I don 't know ! I don 't know what 's going on here ! Gary , you look good , though , all right ? Yeah ? Yeah . So , did you steal this car ? No , I didn 't steal the car . How 'd you get it ? I can get anything I want . And right now , I want to party . Party ? Yeah , and you better think up a name for me , too . What name do you want ? You guys created me , you think of a name for me . How about Lisa ? Why Lisa ? Why not ? He used to like a girl named Lisa . Oh , yeah ? Old girlfriend ? She kicked him in the nuts . Will you shut up ? Look , Gary , it wasn 't your fault . All you said was hello to her . Yeah , look , Wyatt , shut up ! Hey , guys , I like Lisa . That 'll do just fine . Okay , you guys ready to rock ? Ready . Ready . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( WYATT AND GARY YELLING ) ( UP-TEMPO BLUES MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( IN A HIGH-PITCHED VOICE ) Lisa ? Yeah ? I don 't think we belong here . Don 't be silly . It 's a public place . Look , I 'm sure we 'd both love to stay , but we 're not 21 , so I think we 're gonna ... You 're 21 . Well , maybe you 'd feel better if you just got out there and mingled . We don 't mingle , okay ? Well , maybe you 'd be comfortable if I invited all these people back to your house and we could all mingle there . We 'll mingle . We 'll mingle . Hi , dudes . ( ALL GRUMBLING ) Well , goddamn ! You know , listening to this blues music reminds me of my own trials and tribulations as a young guy and ... You know , my folks , they really , really dump on me . They really do . So , you guys get along with your parents ? I guess you guys moved out by now , though , huh ? What 's this , sir ? Drink it .

Crazy insane ? Insane ? Crazy ? I was nuts for the woman , man . Now you gotta believe me , I 'm telling the truth here . I 'm speaking to you . I mean , I was nuts for the girl . And what did it to me was these big titties she had . For a 13-year-old girl , man . She wouldn 't have had to worry about no titties for the rest of her life , boy . You know she was set and she was looking good . That 's the truth , baby . I called her every night for , like , a month . I 'm not talking the bullshit man . Every damn night ? Every night , Mitch . I ain 't playing with you . On the telephone ? What 's this boy talking about , on the telephone , man ? Explain it to him . Goddamn . We know there 's a telephone , boy . What the hell he think I 'm doing ? But he hung up on her . Oh , you didn 't hang up on her ! The chick with those big , big titties ? I hung up on the bitch . Now here 's the capper . You know what the bitch did to me ? Lay it on me . Check this shit out . Listen to what she did to me . She ... She kneed you in the nuts and called him faggot in front of everybody . No .

I don 't know . I warned him about that Blind Dog bourbon . Hey , he don 't even have his license , Lisa . He 's not lying . I don 't even have a learner 's permit . Hey , let 's scout another party , man . What are you gonna tell Chet about me ? Nothing . Nothing ? That 's not very realistic , Wyatt . Look , I don 't know . I 'm just trying to concentrate on the road . You better concentrate a little harder . You 're about to run a red light . Oh , shit ! GARY : I hate that boy ! I always hated that shit ! I never listen to it ! I hate this car ! I hate it ! Are you okay ? Well , my nuts are halfway up my ass . But other than that , I 'm perfect . You better think of what you 're going to do about Chet . He 's one serious idiot . You 're stewed , butt wad ! Who , me ? Know what time it is ? 2 : 00 ? Time to pay the fiddler . I was kind of counting on you to be human about this . Here 's the bottom line , Wyatt . I 'm telling Mom and Dad everything . I 'm even considering making up some shit . ( SIGHS ) All right , Chet . Name your price . $ 175 and zero cents , cash . New bills , crisp and clean , in my wallet by 7 : 00 a.m. Thank you . Hey , what are big brothers for ? See you upstairs . I don 't need you .

( LAUGHING ) He pukes , you die . He 's not laughing at you , Chet . It 's just ... GARY : Yes , I am . Did you tell Chet about the ... Did he tell you about the woman we made tonight ?

You are absolutely right . You 're absolutely right , Chet , absolutely right . What ? Come on . ( RETCHING ) Cold-blooded shit he did . He 's an asshole . Look at his haircut . Anybody with a haircut like that you know is an asshole . Lisa . Where are you ? I 'm right behind you . Surprise ! I 'm not going to hurt you , you silly thing . I mean , your lips . They feel like rigor mortis has set in . Why don 't you try and relax a little bit ? I 'm only kissing you . I wasn 't expecting you to kiss me . I mean , I was just ... I wasn 't ... That was better . Want to try it again ? If you don 't mind . I mean , yes , please , ma 'am . ( WYATT EXCLAIMS ) You sure you 're only 15 ? ( CLEARING THROAT ) I 'll be 16 in June . You made me . You control me . What 's on your mind ? What are you thinking about , huh ? Women 's gymnastics . Well , I don 't know . I 'll do my best . Good . ( GROANS ) Wyatt , Wyatt , Wyatt , where were you ? I 'm right here , Gary . Wyatt , what happened ? I don 't know . I think it was a dream . What ? Everything . Last night , Lisa . The whole thing , it had to be a dream . It can 't be a dream , Wyatt . We were both in it . How can two people have the same dream ? There 's no other explanation . It had to be a dream . Wait , let 's analyze this . All right , in your dream , did I get up in the middle of the night and yak in your sink ? Didn 't throw up . No . Nothing . You didn 't see anything . Maybe it was a dream , you know . A very weird , bizarre , vivid , erotic , wet , detailed dream . Maybe we have malaria . Shit . Gary ! Wyatt ! Breakfast ! Look , I don 't have the kind of bucks it would take to pay Chet off about this . CHET : Yo , Wyatt ! Coffee ! You can 't live in fear of Chet for the rest of your life . Why not ? Just please ... I don 't know , Wyatt . I mean , it 's seriously affecting your sex life . Ten seconds into my gymnastics routine , you passed out . You slept . I did my toes . By the way , you 're very cute .

Now make yourself one , dick weed . I like your panties . ( BURPS ) It 's a joke , Chet . You know , it 's all ... That 's not a joke ! That is a severe behavioral disorder . Those are women 's underpants ! I mean , the next thing you know , you 'll be wearing a bra on your head . The old man 's going to have a stroke on this one for sure . All right , Chet . How much ? How much ? CHET : This goes way beyond payment , pal . Come on , Chet . Please ? Well ... Your VCR should cover it . For openers . Thank you . For Christ 's sakes , will you cover yourself ? You guys looking for something for your mom ? I really don 't think so , Sue . You guys have girlfriends ? You know , Sue , one does really not refer to a 23-year-old woman as a girlfriend . WYATT : Mistress , Gar . GARY : Mistress . Lover . Lover . Sex . Sexpot . She 's a sexpot is what she is . You guys are the ones that got beat up at the homecoming game , right ?

That 's three scents , please . If you were a 15-year-old boy , would these turn you on ? I think so , too . I 'll take them . Do you have a bra to match that ? Something in leather or rubber , or barb wire ? Give me a break . Check it out . Check it out . What ? Five bucks ? Finsky . Max , what are you going to do ? You know what , Gar , for the first time in my life , I don 't feel like a total dick . Yeah , me either . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Sorry , boys . Momentary loss of motor , nerds .

She likes the rough stuff . What can I do , you know ? By the way , there 's a party tonight at Wyatt 's house . You can find his name in the students directory under Donnelly . Pass the word around . Party ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Don 't ask . Wyatt , you 're going to have a heart attack by the time you 're 40 if you don 't learn to relax . Have you tried inversion boots ? Lisa , you don 't understand my parents . LISA : What 's there to understand ? They 're oppressive , meddlesome , difficult , demanding and totally bizarre . I mean , they 're normal parents . Now stop worrying and go and get dressed . WYATT : Lisa , I created you . Why do you do insist on doing things I don 't want ? Honey buns , you want to party so badly , you could bottle it . I mean , you and Gary , you want friends , you want popularity , you want all that stuff , right ? Well , I thought about it , sure , but ... So I 'm giving it to you . Thank you , really , thank you . But I don 't want it in my house . If you want to be a party animal , you have to learn to live in the jungle . Now stop worrying and go and get dressed . I 'm going to go and pick up Gary . I can 't wait to meet his parents . Do you go to Gary 's school ? Do I look like I 'm in high school ? No . Well , what it is , Dad , she 's a foreign exchange student , you know . And they have , like , a different educational system happening around the world . You look very mature . Doesn 't she ? That 's funny you say that ' cause I was thinking the same thing . And what happened was that ... So what do you do for a living , Al ? I 'm an independent businessman . Al ... Dad . My dad 's a plumber . And he 's into plumbing . And , well , I guess you plumb , right , Dad ? Yeah . Yeah , well , I think it 's time to go . You ready ? Where do you think you 're going ? To a party . To a movie . Movie party is what it is , folks . We 're going to a movie party . Such a little liar . No . I 've whipped up this nasty little soiree over at his friend Wyatt 's house . Soir what ? Soiree , honey . I think that means party . Party . You know , there 's going to be sex , drugs , rock and roll , chips , dips , chains , whips ... You know , your basic high school orgy type of thing . I mean , I 'm not talking candle wax on the nipples or witchcraft or anything like that . No , no , no . No , just a couple of hundred kids running around in their underwear acting like complete animals . All right , God damn it ! I 've heard enough ! Gary , you get to your room ! Yes , sir ! No , it 's okay . Just sit here . I 'll take care of this . Girlie , you get the hell out of here before I throw you out . Don 't threaten me , Al ! You 're out of shape . I 'll kick your ass . I 'm going to make this real easy for you . I 'm taking Gary to a party . Over my dead body . He 's a good kid . He studies hard . You 've got no complaints . If anybody should be bitching , it should be Gary . You ever compliment him on his grades ? You ever compliment him on anything ? Hey ! Hey ! Look , Ma , compliments embarrass me . You know . Dad , you know . Shut up ! Shut up ! Have you ever wondered how sad it is that your son 's only sexual outlet is tossing off to magazines in the bathroom ? Oh , Gary ! Ma , I never tossed off to anything ! You told me you were combing your hair ! But I was ! I was ! Mom ! Mom ! I 've never ... Gary , shut up ! Water 's running all day . Shut up ! I 've never tossed off ! I 've never tossed off ! And you wouldn 't tell your own mother ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! This guy deserves a party . Look , I don 't know who you are , what you are , or where you came from , but I 'm not taking any more of this . Dial the police , Lucy . Dial the damn police and give me the phone . ( STUTTERING ) The phone . I 'm going to get the ... Give me the phone . I 'm trying to ... Well , here it is . ( LUCY PANTING ) God . Oh , Christ . AL : Oh , Lord God . ( STUTTERS ) Go ahead ... Make your day ? I 'm really sorry it has to come to this . Come to what ? If you don 't cheer up , I 'll blow your face off . Oh , come on , don 't be such an old lady . Everything 's cool . Everything 's cool ! Everything 's cool . Yeah , yeah . My dad 's going to castrate me . And my mother almost had , like , a cardiac arrest . My parents are never going to let me in the house , and if they do , I 'll be grounded till I 'm 45 . But other than that , everything 's great . Everything 's just really cool . I mean , you know , I mean , couldn 't be better . Listen , trust me for once , will you ? They don 't know what happened . Did you think Gary was acting a little strangely this evening ? Gary ? Who 's Gary ? Lisa , you have to promise me that things aren 't going to get out of control . Wyatt , don 't worry . You 're just having a few friends over . I don 't have any friends , Lisa . He doesn 't . Boy ain 't lying . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) You do now . Hi . ALL : Hi ! MAN : Party ! ALL : Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! Party ! ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SHOUTS ) How you doing ? Where 's the bar ? Bar ! Do you think they 'll embarrass us tonight ? Yeah . Caviar ? If Max and lan see her , it is all over for us . How 's your stomach ? It 's a little better . If you 're going to float an air biscuit , let me know , okay ? Float a what ? If you 're going to fart , if you 're going to squeeze cheese , let me know , okay ? I 'll hit the fan . I 'm sorry , Gary . It 's just I suffer pain and discomfort due to occasional stomach upset . You know , I can 't believe this , Wyatt . I 'm so disappointed in us . I mean , all we ever do is sit around and talk about how great it would be if we went to parties , right ? And ... And now it 's our party , and there are hundreds of people here having a great time , and we 're in the john . We 're in the john . I can 't believe it . Gary , you 're just as uptight as I am , all right ? Let me tell you something . Nobody can be as uptight as you , okay ? Nobody . Your middle name is tense , okay ? Wyatt " Tense Up " Donnelly . All right , this is true . This is true . It 's true . But ... It 's not that bad . I mean , we can hear the music . This is great . We can dance . So that 's great . If we put our noses to the door , maybe we can smell the food . Hey , brother ! What 's happening , my main man ? Right on ! Scotch . Straight up ? Give me the whole bottle . Tell you what . You bend over and I 'll shove it straight up your ass . On the rocks is fine . Yeah , that 's what I thought you were gonna say . There she is . You deal with the drinks . I 'll kill the girls . I wonder if Lisa 's having a good time . Lisa could have a good time at an insurance seminar , Wyatt . You know , the thing that really galls me is that she 's ours and we can 't get close to her . Hit the fan . This is , like , the best party I 've ever been to . I know . It 's great ! Do you know whose house this is ? I don 't know . I think it might be that girl with the English accent . Did you notice that girl doesn 't have a zit on her whole body ? Did you notice that ? I know . She has , like , zero fat . And she 's so relaxed . She burped and it was , like , charming . Charming . Yeah . Shit . Yeah . The bathroom . Ladies . Hi . Hi . Hi . GARY : I can 't believe you ! I cannot ... You 're dropping wolf bait and there are chicks outside ! Light a match or something . Light a fire , I don 't know . Hi . Hi . Hi . We 're sorry . We thought there were just girls in there . I 'm sorry . It 's just us dudes . You know . What are you doing here ? WYATT : Gary was just taking a shit . No , what I meant was ... No , no , what I meant was , what are you doing at the party ? Oh , it 's my house . This is your party ? Yeah , well , you know , we like to do this about once a week . You know , throw little gatherings here . Really ? Yeah , little get-togethers . That kind of thing . Haven 't you guys been by ? Or ... No . How the heck did we miss these two , Wyatt ? I don 't know . So many people , so many parties . So many people , you know , and so many parties . You know , you lose track and ... Would you mind if I came in and checked my face ? What 's wrong with your face ? Can we come in ? Come on in . WYATT : Sure , yeah . Okay . Be our guests . Thanks , guys . Come on in . Well ... We 've seen you guys at school , but we 've never met . You 're Hilly . You 're Deb . How you doing ? Deb . You 're Deb . Hi . I 'm Gary . I 'm Wyatt . Hi , Gary . Well , what have you guys been doing ? This is a wild crowd . I didn 't know you guys had so many friends . Yeah , neither did we . Neither did we . Who 's the girl with the accent ? I thought that this was her party , but I ... You mean the real sensuous , exotic , sexy , mature , sex symbol type ? Yeah . Yeah . GARY : She 's with us . She 's with you guys ? Come on , Lisa . Why not ? Because I belong to Gary and Wyatt . Belong ? What ? They make you in the garage with power tools ? They own you ? Control you ? Seriously . Seriously . They 're toads . Do I look like I 'd go out with two toads ? You do . It 's true . I think Gary and Wyatt are gonna force everyone to redefine their terms . And you 're completely loyal to them ? I do whatever they say . Hi . Could you excuse us for a minute , please ? That 's no problem . Yeah , we 'll be in here . Yeah , that 's where we 'll ... Yeah . Okay , fine . I could be wrong , but I think these ladies are stoked for us , Wyatt . I got that feeling myself . What do we do ? I don 't know . Should we go for it ? What about Lisa ? She did say we should party . Look , let 's get it on with these two , score points and go back to Lisa . This is like a dream come true . How about if we see if we can score the points with these two and deal with them in case we can 't later . Sounds good . But whatever happens , gotta give Lisa a shot . I don 't want to hurt her feelings . I think the girls are looking for a long , lean bone job from me . Ready to party down ? 10-4 . Let 's break . Break . Those guys are weird , but they 're kind of cute . Hi . Hi . And where did you two disappear to ? Nowhere . We were in the kitchen . We were in the bathroom . Eating . Doing our hair . Have you met Gary and Wyatt ? Yeah . No . Sort of . If you get the chance , shower with them . I did . It 's a mind scrambler ! Hurts so good . She took a shower with them . I have a wonderful idea , Henry . After dinner , why don 't we stop by and visit with Wyatt . I hate to think of his being alone at home tonight . Doesn 't he have anything to read ? Well , I don 't know , dear , but you know nothing 's more important to a teenage boy than his grandparents . We 'll drop by . Oh , good . ( LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) I 'd like to open up by apologizing for the ICEE today at the mall . It was very immature . And I 'm sorry . And ... It was just , like , tomfoolery . But we are sorry . It happened . Yeah . So what 's the deal with Lisa ? You know , can we borrow her ? We can 't do that , guys . You know , because common decency prohibits us . We can 't . It 's not that cool . Well , she said it was cool . Yeah . We can 't take advantage of her loyalties . Sorry , guys . Man , but that 's really selfish . That hurts , you know . Lan ...

WYATT : Gary , do you feel like a chicken ? Wyatt , if I could shoot an egg out my ass right now , I would . Well , what about all these people ? Will they think we 're cowards ? I don 't know .

We 're gonna get some stuff . Is this your party ? Well , kind of . I don 't know if you can call it a party . It 's just a few friends . How come two unpopular dicks like you is having a party ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) I don 't know . I mean , I guess I was just asking myself that very question . And unlike dicks , sometimes do the weirdest things . Look , we 're very sorry . We 're ... I don 't know . How would you like all your friends here to know that you wear a bra on your heads ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) Tossed off into any good books lately , have we ?

These guys came into your house and we showed them down . I can 't believe this . You know what we did ? You and me , we saved all these people , Wyatt . You don 't understand that . We 're heroes . This could mean a guest shot on Phil Donahue . I don 't know . But this is exciting , man ! Gary ! What ? Where the hell did you get that thing ? Squirt gun , man . That 's it . ( GUN FIRING ) That 's my boys . What a weird night , huh ? You really weren 't afraid of those guys ? I was scared . But what could I do ? It 's probably a good idea for me not to ask too many questions about tonight . Probably . This is a sort of a night of weird shit . I was wondering if I can ask you something kind of strange ? Would you kiss me ? What about lan ? We all make mistakes . Okay . Where do you want it ? Can I ask you a question ? Yeah . How do you feel about Lisa ? I love her . And that 's what I figured . But ... I mean , it 's definitely a different kind of love . You know , it 's more sisterly , you know . Like big sisterly , kind of . But she 's so beautiful . Yeah , she 's really beautiful . And her body is ... It 's gorgeous . It 's a nice figure . So ... I mean , what would I be compared to her ? Deb , Lisa is everything I ever wanted in a girl before I knew what I wanted . I know that if I could do it again , I 'd make her just like you . Honest . Dead honest . I 'm like ... I ... You know , I ... I gotta tell you ' cause I 'm really honest when I say that . I 'm so very honest . I mean that . ( CAR APPROACHING ) What the hell ? That little bastard . Please don 't let him have messed up my room . If my room 's okay , I won 't kill him . I promise .

Now , look , she has nothing to do with it . Okay . You die . She walks out of here with a severe limp . I 'll be back . That 's Wyatt 's older brother , Chet . He 's kind of an asshole . Oh , hi , Chet . What the hell is going on around here ? Chet , I 'm sorry , it was an accident . An accident ? An accident ? Do you realize it 's snowing in my room , God damn it ? Some real weird shit happened , Chet . Some real weird shit . You don 't have to be a genius to figure that out , monkey dick . Start talking , little man . Look , Chet , it 's a real long story . Gary and I were messing around with the computer Friday night , and we decided to make a woman . And when we did , she went crazy and she messed up the whole house . Don 't smart-mouth me , you wormy little shit ! Why don 't you just leave him alone ? Stay out of this , bimbo . This is a family matter . Chet , just let me find Lisa . She can explain everything . She 'll clear everything up , Chet . I swear . Chet . You can have my college money and my social security , Chet . So , you guys think you can pull one over on me , huh ? Huh ? You got everybody synched to the same bullshit story . This isn 't bullshit . This is a Pershing missile , Chip . It 's Chet . My name is Chet . And I didn 't think it was a whale 's dick , honey . ( BURPS ) Hi , Nanny . Hi , Grampy . I 'm not a moron , you know . I ... Was that my grandparents ? Are they dead ? Oh , no . They 're just resting . What are they doing in here ? LISA : I put them in there . I didn 't want the boys to get into trouble . And quite frankly , they weren 't having a very good time at the party . CHET : Not having a good time ? Do you think they 're having a good time being catatonic in a closet ? Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is ? Boy , I wouldn 't give a squirt of piss for your ass right now . Okay , that 's quite enough . You guys get the girls home . Wyatt , take the Porsche . Gary , you take the Ferrari . The Ferrari ? I want to be alone with Chet here . Good to see you again , Chet . Get out of here ! Come on , take your little hussies home ! Their parents are probably worried sick . Lady , I want to get to the bottom of this , asafp . Oh , so do I. But first , I 'd like to butter your muffin . Why do you have to be such a wanker ? Because I get off on it . Now I want you to promise that you 'll keep your big mouth shut about everything that has happened here this weekend . And I want you to treat Wyatt and Gary with dignity and respect . Oh , really ? Yeah . Oh , really . I can be a real serious bitch if I don 't get what I want . Hit me with your best shot . How fast are you going ? About 35 . ( SIREN WAILING ) Wait . This can 't be right . Are you looking at the rpms ? No . I think I 'm looking at about 50 tickets . ( SIREN WAILING ) Bye ! God damn it ! Stupid train ! Oh , my . That was great ! You son of a bitch ! Al , Al ! Al , that was Gary ! Who is this Gary character ? I had a really great time last night . I 'll probably be grounded for a month or so , but ... I 'll wait for you . Hilly ! I love you ! All right ! I want to thank you for a great night . Same here . Deb , I have kind of a confession to make . I 'm really not this cool . That 's not my car . This is not my suit . I mean , none of those people were my friends . Why are you telling me all of this ? Because I want you to like me for what I am . Whatever you are , I like it . I 'd better get going . 'Cause Wyatt and I still have to deal with Chet . Quit screwing around ! This isn 't funny , you stupid bitch ! Oh , now careful , Chet . Don 't make me angry . Sorry . That 's better . Would you please turn me back to normal , please ? I haven 't done anything to you . No , but you 've done plenty to your brother . Like what ? Well , let me see . You 've nagged him , harassed him , suppressed him , kept him in fear of you . Extorted money from him . It 's done out of love . Just for that I ought to give you a set of elephant balls . ( EXCLAIMS ) Give me your word that you 'll leave Wyatt and Gary alone and I 'll change you back . Oh , all right . Shake on it , huh ? No , thanks . I 'd rather not . Wait ! Where are you going ? Well , I have to go and get changed . What about me ? What about you ? You 'll be fine . It just takes a little while for the effect to wear off , okay ? Well ? I 'm in love . It 's great , isn 't it ? The best . You know , I 'll tell you , Wyatt , I think things are turning around for us . I mean it . Okay , what about Lisa ? Well , I think we 're gonna have to have a talk with her . Think she 'll understand ? I think so . I mean , I sure as hell wouldn 't want to date you . You 're not my type , you know . WYATT : Chet ? Chet ? Hi , dudes ! I 'm sorry , Wyatt . I 'm sorry for being such a shit to you all these years . And , gee , well , I want you to know that I love you . ( BURPING LOUDLY ) ( LAUGHS ) That 's nasty , Wyatt . That 's Chet , Gary . ( FLY BUZZING ) Hey , hey . Oh , my God ! WYATT : Lisa ? In here . Lisa . LISA : Yeah ? You saw Chet ? Yes , I did . WYATT : You responsible ? Yes , I am . Lisa , we can 't have him like that . It 'd ruin Christmas . Listen , he 's gonna be fine in half an hour . He 's not going to spoil Christmas . And he 's not going to bug you anymore , either . ( CLEARING THROAT ) Lisa , we have to have a talk with you . What 's on your mind ? I really don 't know how to say this to you . You guys found girlfriends , right ? Fell in love with the two girls and they fell in love with you . That 's all I ever wanted for you . You 're not hurt ? Yeah , sure I 'm hurt . But I wouldn 't change it . I 'm really just getting off seeing you two guys straightened out . ( SIGHING ) I have to go . I 've had a wonderful time . Lisa . Bye . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Boys ? We 're home ! Hi , Mr. Donnelly . How are you ? Nice to see you . Hi , honey . Nice to see you . Dad , hi . No , no , no , no , no . Like a man . So , what did you guys do this weekend ? Not much .

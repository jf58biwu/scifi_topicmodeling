 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . I don 't see him . George ! ( HENRY GROANING ) MAN : Two officers wounded here . There 's my husband . Get a wheelchair . Hey , I 'm okay . It 's nothing , really . Henry saved my life . Come on , George . Have a seat , officer . It 's my arm . I can walk . Tough guy , huh ? It 's hospital policy . Henry , sit down . Wait , no ! We can 't accept human patients here . We 're not equipped . Take him to County . I didn 't get a chance back there . Look , forget it . When I began supervising medical care during quarantine ... I saw right away that Newcomer physiology ... would present us with a lot of challenges . In surgery , for instance , Newcomers respond to acetylcholine for intubation ... but they don 't tolerate either Forane or Ethrane ... so anesthesiologists have gone back to the old stand-by ... of nitrous oxide and oxygen with morphine sulfate . But Newcomer physiology is not always problematic . Since they have two hearts ... we can generally perform open-heart surgery without a pump . So to all the so-called Purists ... who are constantly slamming the Newcomers , I say give that a try . WOMAN : ( ON PA SYSTEM ) Dr. Trenner to ER Please report to ER . Listen , I 'm gonna need a couple of minutes . Excuse me . I 've been noticing on my brush , the drain in the shower ... I 'm losing my hair . That 's a problem ? You think women like bald men ? All the ones I know do . Why do I bother ? Hey , look , you better be ready . We 're going two-on-two against Dobbs and Quintero today . That 's $ 40 I don 't want to lose . Matt , don 't worry . We Tenctonese are very fast learners . Yeah . That reminds me , Dobbs told me this great joke . There 's a Frenchman , a Russian and a spongehead . They 're in a boat in the middle of the ocean . Is this another one of your racist jokes ? Look , it 's funny . The boat 's sinking . I don 't like racist jokes . George , lighten up . They only got two life jackets ... I really don 't want to hear this . You got no sense of humor . That 's your problem . This is your lucky day , Officer . The pellets haven 't caused any major or permanent damage ... but we are going to have to operate to get them out . Surgery ? It 's a minor procedure . But he will need a general anesthetic . I 'll schedule it for tomorrow morning . Be sure and tell the kids I 'm okay . Ed , I heard we have a police officer here . Dr. Trenner , this is Officer James . He has multiple shotgun pellets embedded in his right forearm ... but there 's minimal subcutaneous bleeding . His blood pressure 's normal and there 's no nerve damage . Trenner ? Jim Trenner ? Matt , I don 't believe it . Unreal . We went to high school together . You haven 't changed . You look great . Get out of here . Don 't tell me you 're a cop . Yeah . You were a delinquent . This guy had his own chair in the principal 's office . Right next to yours . You 've sure turned around , Doctor . Remember that time you pitched that smoke bomb into the faculty john ? Poor Mrs. Putterman . I didn 't know she was in there . I did . Listen , I 'm right in the middle of my rounds but we have got to get together . Yeah . We 're gonna take great care of you . Thank you . Jim . I 'll see you later . Jim Trenner . He 's your age ? Yeah . He looks much younger . Uncle Moodri , you walked all the way from downtown ? ( GOAT BLEATING ) A goat ? Would you like me to bring him in ? No , that 's all right . Can I go pet him ? He 'd like that . George will be so upset that he missed you . Then perhaps I should stay . Stay ? Yes , thank you . I 'd like that . CAMPBELL : You picked the wrong place to hunker , Slags . BUCK : Don 't . MAN : He shot Campbell , man . He shot Campbell . SUSAN : Buck ? Is that you ? Buck ? Yeah . Look who 's here . Uncle Moodri . Hi . Buck . Here 's your cleaning . Thanks . I 've got that job interview at the ad agency . Which one do you think I should wear ? That one 's definitely cooler . Yes , but I 've read you should look trustworthy , responsible . Would you like to borrow my skirt ? No , thank you , Uncle , I don 't think it 's quite right . I think this one 's it . Buck , would you take your bike out of the guest room ? Uncle Moodri 's gonna be staying for a visit . MATT : Damn it , George ! The ball . The ball . ( MATT CHUCKLING ) This way . Hit me . Come on . George , I 'm open . That 's it . Break for the basket . Good try , Matthew . Yeah , man . You had an eye test recently ? You might need some glasses , buddy . I got chewing gum or something on my shoe . Sikes-Francisco , 6 , Dobbs-Quintero , 11 . Twelve , Albert . You get two points for a basket , two points . DOBBS : Matthew , here . ( DOBBS WHOOPING ) When I cut , hit me . Here , George , I 'm open ! Very good , George , very good . What are you doing , man ? I was open . I made the basket . Isn 't that the point ? We 're a team , George . Teamwork . Hey , Mutt , Jeff , may we proceed ? Watch your man . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) Oh , man . Yeah , you tell him , coach . Matthew , I think I can help you . You 've been shooting with a trajectory angle of approximately 45 degrees . Now , as you know the ball drops at 32 feet per second per second . So , if you ... You don 't know how to keep score but you 're telling me about trajectory angles ? Well , they 're really very different . Jeez , it 's hot . You must remember the ozone layer . Are you wearing sun block ? Yes , George . I 'm gonna alley-oop this one . Set me up . Alley-oop , George . DOBBS : Getting old there , man , huh ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You 're limping . I 'm fine . ( SIGHING ) Officer James , you 're not supposed to be in this wing . I thought you didn 't take human patients . I really must ask you to leave . What 's going on ? Please . It 's not safe here with all the equipment . ( GRUNTING ) Look , I 'm okay . If I could just get you inside . Perhaps I should carry you . No . Hello . What happened ? Matthew pulled a muscle in his groin . It 's really more my leg . Do you have pain or swelling in your testicles ? No . They 're fine . Would you like for me to take a look ? Oh , sure , I 'll just go put on some clean underwear . Thanks , George , just blab it all over town . There 's little sour milk in the cupboard . Really ? August . ( GROANING ) I tell you , George , I 'm getting old , and I 'm feeling it . Next month , 37 , whammo . You look pretty good . How old are you ? About 70 . What ? In your solar years , I 'm 70 . Get out of here . It 's quite true , Mathew . Our systems are very different . In your years , our median life expectancy is about 140 . This has very good nose . You telling me you guys don 't get old like we do ? Of course we grow old , just at a slower rate . So , what , Emily 's 35 ? No , she 's 10 . But you just said that you guys ... Our growth rate parallels that of yours until after adolescence . And then at about age 20 it slows to about half that of humans . Albert , he 's 56 . Unreal . I suppose it 's rather like humans and dogs . You know , for every human year a dog ages about seven . So we 're the dogs . Yes . Soft , very subtle finish . Excuse me . My friend had surgery this morning , Henry James . I can only give information to the immediate family . I am a police officer . He 's a colleague . Talk to Dr. Trenner . Dr. Trenner , how did Henry James do ? He went into respiratory failure during surgery . We lost him . He died ? Henry ? I 'm sorry . We tried everything . Excuse me . I have to tell his wife . ( CHANTING IN TENCTONESE ) ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Dahmuhsa , known here as Henry ... is now ultimately free . We clothe his body in the robes of our ancestors ... the garments we wore as free people ... to symbolize the soul 's liberation . And we place Dahmuhsa apart ... for his essence is no longer with us . It resides now with Andarko and Celine . Please , rise ... and help us speed Dahmuhsa 's soul to its resting place . ( SINGING IN TENCTONESE ) ( ALL SINGING IN TENCTONESE ) Why , George ? ( SINGING ABRUPTLY STOPPING ) ( WHISPERING ) Why did he die ? They said it was nothing . They said they would take good care of him . So , how could this happen ? What do I tell my children ? GEORGE : Your neighbor , Cathy ? I don 't see why we couldn 't just ask Dr. Trenner . It 's no problem . Cathy 's in here a couple of days a week doing research . Besides , I don 't wanna go to Jim unless I think something 's wrong . You know , you can 't anticipate an adverse reaction to an anesthetic ... or the trauma of surgery . With the Tenctonese here on Earth , we still have so much to learn . Dr. Trenner has done more than anyone to build a database of our pathology . If I could just see this . How 's your groin today ? Splendid , thanks . It says here , he was given a tracheotomy . That 's in the throat . He was hit in the arm . Well , he couldn 't breathe . They had to open an airway . " Anaphylactic reaction to anesthetic ... " " tongue became edematous blocking the trachea . " Tracheotomy is standard procedure . She 's right , George . There 's nothing here . Excuse me . Did you , by any chance , scrub on Henry James ' surgery ? What ? She says several patients have died in surgery . I 'd like to see those patients ' charts ? Yes . Don 't worry , we 'll keep you out of this . This is the last one , Weber , Max . Look for any similarities . You think I know what I 'm looking for here ? " Open reduction ... " Anaphylactic . " Anaphylactic reaction of vocal cords , tracheotomy . " " Rhinoplasty , patient aspirated vomitus , tracheotomy . " Same here . " Mastectomy , aspiration of vomitus , tracheotomy . " Cathy , hi . What are you doing here ? We 've found something very peculiar . You 've had a large number of respiratory deaths in surgery . Yeah , tell me about it . We 're going crazy . So you know ? Of course . Dr. Trenner assigned me to try and figure out why . So far , nothing . Look , George , Henry was a cop , a bro , but there 's no point in this . Cathy , I hate to be in this position but medical files are confidential . I really can 't allow you access without the permission of the families . No , you 're right . I 'm terribly sorry . Would you like for me to refile these ? No , thank you . I 'll have one of the clerks do it . Thank you . I want Henry autopsied . Oh , George ! Henry saved your life , I know that . You feel bad , I feel bad ... but what are we gonna learn that they didn 't ? I 'm not ready to face Henry 's kids yet . Are you ? Susan Francisco ? Yes . Come in , please . Hello , I 'm Beth Meadows . I 'm Susan Francisco . You know that . Have a seat , Susan . Thank you . Your application says you 're a graduate of USC ? Yes , that 's right . My father went to USC . Really ? I love your pin . Where did you get it ? My husband gave it to me as an anniversary present . How sweet ! My boyfriend just moved out . Susan , you don 't mind my asking , but how old are you ? Not at all . In your years , I 'm 68 . Sixty-eight ? Well , that 's roughly equivalent to a human female in her mid-30s . Susan , we need to reach young buyers . We need ideas that are dangerous , on the edge . Do you know what I mean ? Yes , I think I do . Outrageous , in-your-face . Would you like to see my portfolio ? We really have to trans-mutate into teenagers , get inside their heads . My portfolio ... What I 'm trying to say , I don 't think you 'd be happy here . I don 't see anything unusual here . Ditto . There 's edema of the small bronchi but that 's consistent with asphyxia . Would you please take a look at the tracheotomy ? Trenner does some fine work . I 've seen some real butchers in here . Look , I 'm gonna take off for a while . Are you all right , Matthew ? Yeah , I 'm just kind of thirsty . I 'm gonna go grab a cold one . That 's odd . You see it ? The spartiary gland is missing . What 's that ? We 're not sure of all of its functions but it helps regulate metabolism . LEE : Maybe it was taken out during the embalming procedure . In some cultures the heart and other organs are removed before burial . No organs are removed . It 's considered desecration . Maybe it was removed at the clinic . Why ? Why wasn 't it in his chart ? Jim , I really appreciate your coming down . It 's no problem . It was on my way . All we 're looking for is a couple answers , then I think everybody 's happy , right ? I think I can explain the spartiary gland . You see , among other things , we perform the function of being a research facility . As Cathy will tell you , we are really lacking in our knowledge ... of Newcomer pharmacophysiology . We 've got to put together a lot of information quickly ... so we can develop procedures , drugs . So we can provide these people with decent medical care . About the gland ? He 's like a dog with a bone . Every patient signs a release permitting us , in case of death ... to remove certain organs for research purposes . We couldn 't function without that ability . Was the spartiary gland removed on all these patients ? I 'm not sure , but probably . Why wasn 't this reported on the medical charts ? Human error , I guess . Some of us are only human . Is there anything else ? No , thanks again . You know , I have devoted the last four years of my life ... to Newcomer medicine , to training Tenctonese physicians . I have given up time , family , a great deal of money . You better not be implying that I 'm not doing right by these people . No , Jim , not at all . You know these Tenctonese . Once they get an idea in their heads ... Forget it . There 's nothing wrong with being thorough . Thank you for your time . I will show you out . Matt , I 'm sorry I got ticked off . I was up all night with a patient . Hey , no sweat . Listen , I 'm having a little party this afternoon , maybe you can come . We could relive the old days at Belmont High . Yeah , sure . Let me give you my address . It 's a little bit out of the way . Actually , why don 't I just send my driver ? Driver ? Yeah , is that okay ? Yeah . Okay , he 'll pick you up at 5 : 00 . All right . Did the doctor say anything else ? No , he just invited me over . So look , George , you satisfied now ? You clearly are . That 's right . Tell me , would you be so complacent if Dr. Trenner weren 't an old friend ? Hey , man , I 'm still a cop . Would you be so complacent if Henry were human ? That 's out of line , George . Is it ? You and your racist jokes , your snide remarks . " You know those Tenctonese . Once they get something into their head ... " Give me a break . You 're so damn sensitive , I wanna puke . Yes , and you and your good , clean fun bigotry makes me just as ill . I 'll see you . Thank you . The feet look good . I 'd stay away from the snout . I think you know something more about my friend 's death . I can understand you wanting to protect your colleagues ... but people are dying here and if you know something , you must tell me . I could lose my job over something I 'm not even sure about . Comfort yourself with that the next time someone dies . Keep walking . It 's humans . They 're causing this . When your friend died , when all of them died ... a human was undergoing surgery in the adjoining theater . Humans ? I heard you say you didn 't take humans . Dr. Trenner still has some of his old patients . He treats them here . Obviously , he 's not keeping a very sterile field around the Newcomers . Some human virus , some bacterium , is affecting our people . What kinds of procedures is he performing on the humans ? I don 't know . Only he and Dr. Windsor do the operations . They don 't even keep those files at the hospital . They take them home . The only thing I know , it 's always the same procedure . I 've seen the patients coming out of surgery . They all have a dressing here , on the right flank . Humans should never be treated in Tenctonese hospitals . You can 't imagine the bacteria in their digestive system alone . They 're biologic nightmares . SUSAN : I don 't know how you can watch that stuff . ( TV REMOTE CLICKING ) ( SIGHING ) Your day was not good . I 've been to four ad agencies so far , and everywhere it 's the same thing . The minute I mention my age , that 's it . They won 't even look at my work . They don 't think you are old enough ? No , they think I 'm too old . They have this very odd fixation about age . That 's what happens when people live their whole lives on only one planet . They don 't understand that time is relative . So what do I do ? There 's no way they 're gonna hire a 35-year-old woman let alone a 68-year-old . What age would they like you to be ? I don 't know . Twenty-eight . Tell them you 're 28 . That 's what you 'd be on Tromus Four . Hey , Matt . Jim . I meant to ask you what did you do to yourself ? I pulled a muscle . It 's a long , embarrassing story . You 've done okay since Belmont High . I was a plastic surgeon before the Newcomers arrived . You 'd be amazed what people will pay to lose a couple years . Hey , I wouldn 't mind dropping a few . Anyway , there 's a Frenchman , a Russian and a Slag on a boat ... in the middle of the ocean , and the boat is sinking . And they only have two life jackets ... Matt , this is Celeste , my significant other . This week , anyway . And this is Matt , Celeste . Hi . Will you guys excuse me ? Sure . Jim tells me you were a real football hero . About a million years ago . This is my friend , Lisa Bancroft , Matt Sikes . Matt doesn 't know anyone here . Take care of him , Lisa . I 'd love to . So , you 're a cop , right ? Yeah . How exciting . You carry a gun ? Yeah . We have to . What does a girl have to do to see it ? I pulled something good out of the cellar . You 're wasting this on me . I 'm used to screw-tops . Come on , I don 't believe that . Get out of here . What do you think ? Wow . Life 's too short to drink cheap champagne . Remember that time we double-dated the Schuler twins ? You remember that ? We were parked on Mulholland Drive , really going at it . Jim , come on . I 'll tell you later . Okay . So , Matt , is Lisa taking good care of you ? This is delicious . It 's triple zero beluga . Caviar , they fly it in fresh from the Caspian Sea . Man , I could get used to this . Thanks . Matt ? Are you all right ? Guess I 'm just not used to this good champagne . You know , you are so beautiful . ( CROCKERY CLATTERING ) I need some air . You 're outside . Oh , yeah . ( LISA GASPING ) Open his collar . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Matt ? Hey , good morning . What happened ? Just a bit too much bubbly . You okay ? Fine . Great , in fact . I don 't remember a thing . I hope I wasn 't out of line . No . Lisa was a little upset when you poured the butter sauce down her back . No . I 'm kidding . I tell you though , I feel great . You know that muscle pull ? It 's gone . Yeah , when you fell . I took care of that . It 's nothing serious . Thanks . Listen , Matt , there 's something I wanna ask you . You 're probably gonna tell me to go to hell , but ... We 're expanding the clinic and I 'm gonna need a new chief of security . The job won 't give you the same satisfaction , maybe , as police work ... but the hours are a hell of a lot better and I 'm sure the pay would be , too . I never thought about leaving the force . Okay , forget I even ... Wait . I mean , I don 't mean to sound greedy ... but what kind of salary are we talking about ? $ 130,000 a year , to start . Matt , it would be like old times . Plus , the benefits are outstanding . You work for me , you 'll feel as good as you do now for the rest of your life . Think about it , okay ? I almost forgot . Lisa wanted me to give you this . It 's her phone number . How was your party ? It was okay . I 'm sorry about yesterday . Yeah , me , too . Forget it . Man , I feel good . I haven 't felt this good in years . I did learn something rather bizarre about the clinic , though . George , can 't you drop that ? I really think you should hear this . You don 't feel it 's an odd coincidence ? I 'm sure there 's lots of times when he had humans there and nobody died . I 'm sure his people looked into it . You should see his house . Unbelievable . And , listen to this . Jim offered me a job , head of security , $ 130,000 to start . Sounds like a good opportunity . I 'm not getting any younger , the department 's a dead end ... they promote Grazer over me , come on . As I said , it sounds like a good opportunity . But just remember , all that gold doesn 't glitter . There are two birds in a bush . I got it , George . Are you going to accept the offer ? I 'd be a fool not to . What ? Matt , that dressing . It 's nothing . I had a little too much last night , took a fall . Were you at the clinic ? No , I was at Trenner 's . I passed out . You passed out ? Yeah , what 's the big deal ? That nurse said all the patients had a dressing just like that . ( PHONE RINGING ) Los Angeles , Trenner Clinic , please . What are you doing ? Pathology , please . Yes , this is Dr. Berlin at the Coroner 's Office . We received a death certificate on a patient ... who died in your hospital last night . It 's smudged . I can 't make out the cause of death . Thank you . Last night , a Newcomer died in surgery ... after respiratory blockage and a tracheotomy . You were there , Matt . You had an operation . George is right . You did have a surgical procedure . What could he have operated on ? It 's hard to say . Your kidneys perhaps or your adrenal glands ? Adrenal glands , what exactly do they do ? They 're part of the endocrine system , metabolism . And the spartiary gland taken from our people ... Also metabolism . And metabolism is the generation and degeneration of tissue in the body . Well , that 's aging . Matt , you said you were feeling exceedingly well today , youthful . Matt , you said you were feeling exceedingly well today , youthful . So ? That was after the operation . Yeah ? Wait a minute . I can see where this is going . Give me a break . The Fountain of Youth ? The fountain of what ? You think Trenner takes a little piece of Newcomer ... puts it in a human being and , bingo , you lose 10 years ? Matt , it is possible that the spartiary gland has some property ... that slows or even reverses the aging process in humans . That is why Trenner looks so young . He 's using tracheotomies to cover the removal of the gland ... and he implants them in humans . This is crazy , man . You think he is a murderer ? Matt , you know yourself that humans are obsessed with youth . They would do anything to hold on to it . Look , I grew up with this guy . We were like brothers . Can you give me another explanation ? Oh , God ! Dr. Trenner . Why ? I imagine money . And all the time in the world to spend it . We need the records of Dr. Trenner 's human patients . Let 's get a warrant . Insufficient evidence . God , I hate this job sometimes . But to call the judge a moron ... He is a moron ! Feel better ? We 're going into Trenner 's house . Gotta get those files . You 're suddenly quite zealous . We were friends . He lied to me , he tricked me , he put that stuff in me . But that 's not why , George . Because he 's killing people . Matt , we don 't even have a warrant . You were the one who talked about having to face Henry 's kids . You wanna sit back on this , fine . I 'm not gonna . Are we there yet ? Yeah . Give me a minute before you go in . Matt , glad you called . How 're you feeling ? Unbelievable . That job you mentioned , I want it . Great . Jim , I gotta know something . Whatever you slipped me last night was fantastic . I want more . Slipped you ? Come on . It was in the champagne , right ? Come on , don 't hold out on me . Imagine , think about this Matt . Imagine if Mozart could 've taken a drug to live another 50 years ... or Rembrandt , or Einstein . Is that it ? Is that what you got ? Imagine how much richer the world would be . And the guy who owned the drug wouldn 't be so bad off either . You think Salk didn 't make money from his vaccine ? He still cured polio . All right . So how do I get some more of this stuff ? How bad do you want it ? You kidding ? Tell me , is that partner of yours still playing Sherlock Holmes ? My partner , give me a break . Do you know what it 's like to be saddled with one of those melon heads ? I know , you 're supposed to be the great Slag savior ... but personally , I can 't stand them . Matt , you sound like a Purist . Hey , between you and me ... Let me show you something . I 've taken this patient the farthest . She 's had a dozen treatments . This was her after four treatments . Six treatments . Nine . This is Lisa Bancroft today after 12 treatments . Matt , you Purists are a little shortsighted . These Newcomers are a wonderful gift . It 's a natural resource . Is that what you put inside me ? Something from a Slag ? You don 't seem to be hurting . You remember Genesis ? " Be masters of the fish of the sea ... " " the birds of the air and all living creatures of this Earth . " Sounds like a plan , huh ? How young could I be ? Pick an age . ( JIM CHUCKLING ) JIM : I was out last night with Celeste ... GEORGE : Henry . ... saw a couple of the later Beethoven quartets . You really forget how beautiful they are . Complex . Man , Opus 131 has this adagio , it is magnificent . I mean , it brings tears to your eyes . There 's the spartiary gland . I think we can pull the plug on this one . You know , I am gonna get that CD . Matt , you really gotta get that partner of yours to ease off . I can do that . ( PHONE BEEPING ) Excuse . Yeah . Where were we ? I tell you , Matt , we got great days ahead of us . Roll up your sleeve . It 's a booster . It 's part of the treatment . So soon ? Why wait ? Roll up your sleeve . Needles , you know , they really give me the willies . Come on , man , I 'll give you a lollipop . No , really , I 'd really rather hold off on this . Give him the shot . Matt ! George ! Are you all right ? I 'm so glad to see you . George , we gotta get out of here . Yes , whatever you say . George , walk ! I 've been shot . Oh , shot . That 's unfortunate . Now listen to me , George , you 're gonna have to drive . I like to drive . Start the car ! Now put in gear . Go ! Go , now ! Did we hit something ? Nothing important , George . My late husband . This is my son , Tom , he lives in Zurich . I 've avoided seeing him . I couldn 't explain why I look so young . Did you know ? I don 't need to worry now . In a year or two , I 'll look like Tom 's mother again . Did you know he was killing Newcomers ? Give me the Trenner papers . Why ? The papers and the disks . What are you doing ? Matt , that 's evidence . We 've got enough to convict . No , the research , no . This has blood on it . If you destroy these papers all those people will have died for nothing . This must be shared . How the hell can you say that ? How many more people have to die ? Your people ! Trenner was insane . You can 't judge all scientists because of him . This might be used for some good . Yeah , that 's what they said when they split the atom . Never bet on the goodness of the human race . " MFA , USC . " And may I ask your age ? 28 . Okay . Let 's see your portfolio .

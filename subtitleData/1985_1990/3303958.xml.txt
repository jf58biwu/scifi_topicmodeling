Mister , that man says he 's from another planet ; we need to do something . Call the ambulance I will call but he 's almost barefoot - he 'll catch a cold Hello ! Hello . Pardon my odor . It 's cold . I picked this up from an iron bin . Good man . Friend ! Tell me the number of your planet in " Tentura " ? Or at least the number of your galaxy in the spiral ? I got my contacts mixed up and now I can 't return home . We don 't know the number . We forgot , my friend . And now this lad will go and call information , and we 'll wait for him in the bakery , OK ? And put this on meanwhile ... Ah , thank you ... Listen , friends . There 's no need for the bakery , no need for information . Here is my planet ... Uzm , 247 in " Tentura " , galaxy Beta in the spiral . Here is a space travel machine ... So which buttons do I press to get back home ? Time is relative - do you understand that ? Let me make a suggestion . We 'll just press the button and go to your place . But if the machine doesn 't work , then you 'll come with us where we want you to , OK ? No , we can 't ... You have to know ... Yeah , we can ... What do you see ? Sand ... So the thingamajig worked ... and that idiot , with holes , stayed behind ? ! Stay calm , just stay calm ... The sun is here , the sand is here , the gravity is here . So where are we ? We 're on Earth . Or ... Or ? No , let 's take it we 're on Earth , in some desert ... OK ? Karakum ? Eh ? What other deserts do we have ? Gobi , Sahara ... No , I said OUR deserts ! Well , WE also have Kyzyl Kum ... No . Let 's assume that this is Karakum . OK ? So that means ... The sun 's in the west ... so , Ashabad is that way . Got it ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ... let 's go ! Mister , what 's your name ? Vladimir Nikolayevich . And I 'm Gedevan . Pleased to meet you ... You have a bottle in your bag ... Wine ? Nah , it 's vinegar . And some herbs ... kindza ( coriander ) . Nice ... Vladimir Nikolayevich , do you remember what number he said , the guy that has my sock ? No . Perhaps we 're on the same planet that he came from ? Listen , Skripach ! Whatever we guess , it won 't make the matters any clearer ... We 've picked a direction and walk ... The main thing is to get to water . Got it ? Vladimir Nikolayevich , I want to put my slippers on . So put them on ! Then stop ! What 's the time ? Four . Night ? Night ... Are you late somewhere ? I called from the airport to say I 'd be there in an hour , and here I am ... Are you studying at the conservatory ? No , it 's someone else 's . Professor Rogozina . He gave a concert for us , and they forgot to put the violin in the plane . A banquet ? No , lunch ... Ah ! Are you from Tbilisi ? From Batumi . I thought I 'd return the violin , and still have time to catch the train . I study textiles in Ivanovo . Aha ... At first I took entrance exams to MGIMO , to the Institute of International Affairs , but they told me there that ... Quiet ! ... A man ... Hello ... Capitalist country . Do you know any languages ? English . Some French . Tell them we have no money ... Tell them ! Hello ! We are tourists , we separated from our group . Could you give us a lift to the city , and then we 'll figure something out on our own ... . translate . Do you speak English ? Parle Francaise ? Hello .. Do you speak English ? Parle Francaise ? ... Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? Chatl ! No money . Money , documents , currency - all left with the tour guide . It was an accident ... We turned our backs for a minute and ... got lost in the sand . Take it . It 's warm . Excuse me , what ? You want my hat ? You are welcome . This isn 't mine , I can 't give it to you ... There 's nothing in there . Open it . It 's not wine , it 's vinegar . Sour , yeah ? Friend , so we 've agreed ? You 'll give us a lift ? Skripach , come on quickly ... Like I said - - to the nearest town , and then we 'll figure out our own way back .. What , the jacket ? Good thing I didn 't give them the violin . must have felt ashamed ... Ktse ! What do you mean ' Ktse ' ? It seems he wants a match You want a match ? There you go . The whole box ? Get us away from here , and we 'll give you ' Koo ' . Not a single letter , not a single " Made in ... Pardon me , I don 't understand ... Sprechen Sie Turkish ? What do they want ? They want Koo ! Tsak ! Thank you ... He wants me to put on the bell . Too bad . I 'll put it on , Vladimir Nikolayevich , if it makes him happy ... Go ahead ! OK , fine ... I 'm going to smoke , please permit me to pass ... Relax , relax ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , perhaps we really are on ... Yes ! Typical Martians . Lusenka , dearest , troublemaker ... You had to have those ... macaroni . So . We know Russian . Why was it necessary to conceal this ? We weren 't concealing . It 's very hard to understand a language , when you 're thinking in two languages . And that Patsak is talking all the time in languages , the rest of which he doesn 't know . What are you staring at ? Maimoona verishvilo . They know Georgian too ... What did he say ? Monkey son of donkey . So . We 're from the Soviet Union , here on a cultural exchange . Our people know we are here , and are looking for us . If you do not let us contact our embassy , you will have big problems , got it ? We don 't understand ' embassy ' . You better put on Tsak right now ! So , you understand Macaroni , you understand Maimoona , but you don 't know what an embassy is ... Quit jerking us around already , got it ? You thought about Macaroni , and I simply repeated it . This is not Earth , or Africa , friend . This is planet Plyuk , 215 in Tentura , galaxy Kin Dza Dza in the spiral . Got it ? That 's just great ... Put on the bell , friend ... Come on There you go ... good boy . Excuse me , where are we ? Sh ! She has very sensitive ears . Do you know Tentura coordinates for your planet ? Tentura ? Well , tell us the number of your galaxy in the spiral . In the spiral ? In the spiral . The spiral ... Yes ... You know , the Earth is where ... It orbits with such planets as ... Venus , Saturn , Mars , Jupiter What others , Vladimir Nikolayevich ? Ursa Major . Vladimir Nikolayevich - come here . On your planet do you have more matches ? We have some How many will you give us if we put you back there ? How many do you need ? Two full match boxes like these ! Seven ! Seven . Give us what you have now , I will buy a Gravitsapa with them . Sorry , but what is a Gravitsapa ? Gravitsapa , is the thing without which the Pepelats can fly only like this , but with one - to any point in the Universe in five seconds . Guys , why would you take a Gravitsapa-less Pepelats out of the garage ? It 's not right We had a Gravitsapa , but when we came to this planet it was stolen . Aha . Excuse me , would you happen to have a space travel machine ? No . No . Give me the matches . Give me some water . Like this ! You need to do this ! You need to do this ! Do this ... This is yours . From now on you smoke like this . Thank you . He says they have a Gravitsapa . Put your matches here . Here 's what we are going to do . When you put us back on Earth , you 'll get this ... and this ... What do you mean ? Lets go , Skripach , to outer space Stop ! Give it back . Give it back ! On Mother Earth you 'll get them . Vladimir Nikolayevich ! You said if we give you a lift , you 'll give them all to us . And now you 've stolen one match from us . Patsak shouldn 't cheat another Patsak , it 's not nice , friend ... I said - give us a lift to the town ! And what 's this ? A shed . And what 's this ? What 's this ? What 's this here - not a town ? ! Quit jumping around . Show us this Gravitsapa . If it 's a brand name - we 'll take it . Patsak ! What kind of idiots would accept contraband Ktse from me in front of eye witnesses , when they could get a life term laying on nails for it ? Have you got any brains in your head ? We 'll buy it ourselves . Lets go . Stop ! I said stop ! Who are you ? I am asking , who are you ? Alien Foreman . No . You 're a Patsak . And who are you ? I 'm a Georgian . No , You 're a Patsak too . You 're a Patsak , you 're a Patsak and he 's a Patsak . But I 'm Chatlanian , and they are Chatlanian . So you put on the Tsak and sit in the Pepelats , understand ? What ? Watch when I point this device at myself , friend ... which point registers ? Green . Now at him , watch - green too . And at you ... Green . Now look at Uef - which colour ? Orange ? Because he is Chatlanian ! Well , do you understand ? What ? Plyuk is the Chatlanian planet . Therefore we , Patsaks , must wear the Tsak ... Yes , and in front of the Chatlanians you must do this ... Vladimir Nikolayevich , it 's unashamed racism . Show us again , please . Like this ! If you would , a little slower ... Like this . Vladimir Nikolayevich , you have a wife back home , a straigt-F student son , a cooperative flat you haven 't paid for , and here you are ... messing with us This could end badly , friend . OK , Skripach , let 's play along ... Good boy . Now give the match back to Uef , and he will buy the Gravitsapa . But he said that you need all of them . I was joking . Very funny . Wait . We 'll go together ... Don 't show them your Ktse , and don 't think about them . You show them my Ktse . And don 't give them more than half a match . Gravitsapa costs half a match . Your Patsak said a whole match . He was also joking . Grade 300 cement ? Patsak ! Remember - half or less . Okay . Excuse me , Chatlanian and Patsak - is it nationality ? No . Biological factor ? No . Persons from other planets ? No . So what the difference between them ? Are you color blind , Skripach ? Can 't you tell apart green color from orange ? Tourist ! Eh ! Skyscraper ! Come on , come on ... do as I showed you ... Hello , miss . Aren 't you chilly in that coat ? They aren 't letting me in , they are letting you in alone . Don 't give them Ktse , bring the Gravitsapa here , and I 'll look at it . Go on ... Not you ! We 're together ! Not you ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , tell him ! It 's alright . Wait here . Only don 't go anywhere ! Hi How 's life ? You want me to curtsy ... well , out of respect for the ladies present ... Well , what 's new on Plyuk ? Lay down the Ktse , and you 'll get the Gravitsapa . Half ? Half . Can I have look ? Go ahead . Actually , I am not a specialist on these Gravitsapa . Let 's go and show it to my Chatlanian , he 'll check in . Right , we 'll just put the Tsapa on . Sore throat ? Water ... I have a proposal . I 'll give you that Ktse , and you give me two bottles of water . Agreed ? OK . Do you have any food ? Porridge ... What kind ? Plastic . Here , I give you this whole Ktse , and you get me 5 bottles of water , and 1 kilo of porridge . What 's this ? Ktse . We need to check it again . So check it ! Hey , just a second ! One moment ... Skripach ! Can you get matches on Earth ? I can . If you can spit this farther , I 'll give you half a Chatl . Here ... with this . If I can , you give me two matches ... . Got it ? No . It 's a simple game . I give you half a Chatl , you give me three matches on Earth . Here , spit , sonny . Thanks , but I don 't want to . Fine . You put up one match , and I 'll put up three Chatl , yellow pants , and this much head start . Come on ! No ! Blue pants ... Mr. Uef , I will not do this under any circumstances . Is that your final decision ? So why are you messing with my head then ? Maimoona verishvilo ! Mr. Uef ! I am a representative of a civilized planet , and I demand that you mind your lexicon ! Where are they ? Who ? The one with a scar . Like an idiot , I gave him all the matches . Stop it guys . Enough ! Enough ? What do you mean enough ? I told him a thousand times we need to go to the center . But he 's greedy , like all Chatlanians - ' for two Chatlas cheaper ! ' There 's still one left . As far as I understand it , enough for a Gravitsapa . Give it to me . Here . Why ? To buy a Gravitsapa . Where ? There , in the center . And how will you return us to Mother Earth , when you don 't even know in which galaxy it spins ? The number of your planet , idiot , any planetarium in the center will give you for two Chatlas ! Give me the match ... So you could cover us in sand ? So you won 't give it ? No . Is that your final decision ? Couldn 't be any more final . Then goodbye , friend . They 'll leave , Vladimir Nikolayevich . They won 't go anywhere , they would choke themselves for a match . Either you give us that match now , or we won 't take you to Earth for less than seven boxes ! Two thousand . Three Two thousand three hundred Three Two thousand five hundred , I can 't give you more . You can , friend . Mr Bee , I have 50 rubles . Matches cost 2 kopeks a box , that means I can buy two and a half thousand ... Skripach is lying ! He has more Chatls . Mr. Uef ! I am not Skripach to you ! My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich ... What 's there , the engine ? Don 't poke your nose in every hole ! ... Gedevan Alexandrovich ... Gedevan , let 's tie up these lads now and lay in a course North . Why ? What if the waters of Mediterranean Sea are splashing there ? Ha ha , Vladimir Nicolaevich , have you gone out of your mind , friend ? Where would there be any seas on Plyuk ? They made Luts from them long ago . Sorry , they made what ? Fuel , Skripach , fuel ... Here , you owe us six thousand one hundred and forty boxes . How come so many ? You ate porridge , you drink water ... and Bandura ( musical instrument ) . Cross off Bandura ... we aren 't taking the Bandura . Put it down ... Let 's take it - we 'd be bringing back at least something technological , otherwise who would believe us ? So trade them the violin , if you like it so much . The violin is Italian , 18th century . It costs 1000 rubles if not more . How would I pay back for it ? Skripach , instead of thinking that you 're the first Georgian cosmonaut , and that you 'll be a Nobel prize laureate , return the spoon you stole from destitute artists . I wasn 't thinking anything of the sort ... I wanted to give it to the Institute of non-Ferrous Metals , in case it 's something new ... Heavens ! The heavens have never seen as shameful Patsak as you , Skripach . I am very deeply offended . Where are you going ? To the restroom . You can 't go to the restroom with money . Leave money here . Gedevan Aleksandrovich . Ktse is very expensive , friend . Why ? Well , on Earth , how do you decide who should squat in front of whom and how many times ? Well , you just have to eyeball it . Savages ! Listen , I like you , so I 'll teach you If I have a little bit of Ktse , I have the right to wear yellow pants . And in front of me a Patsak must squat not one , but two times . If I have a lot of Ktse , I have the right to wear crimson pants , and Patsaks must squat twice before me , and Chatlanian must say Koo . And Ecilop don 't have the right to beat me at night - ever ! I have a proposal , friend . You give us the match now , and we 'll bring you yellow pants later , OK ? Thanks , I have some already , perhaps Skripach needs some . Skripach ! The aliens are offering pants , yellow . Do you need any ? Skripach is gone , friend . How ? I ejected him . Don 't worry , Vladimir Nikolayevich . We have another escape pod , new one . That one was broken anyway . I don 't understand ... I pressed the button - he flew away . Skripach is unnecessary , friend , he only consumes extra fuel ... Turn around ! Not possible ... Luts is gone . We need to fly to Luts station . Turn around ! Or I 'll light this damned Ktse now ! Gedevan ! Skripach ! Skripach ! Where could he have disappeared to ? We are telling you - the Ecilops caught him . Let 's get moving , friend . Death would be too good for you . Contact the Ecilops by radio ! But we don 't have a radio , we threw it out . I am going to go check ... Ecilop ! Put on your Tsak , quickly ... Put on your Tsak . He can get bent Put it on , or he will Trankluk you . You and the match . Good day . Listen , friend , we lost a young lad here , you haven 't come across him ? What ? Oh ! Sorry , I forgot ... They say you picked him up . Didn 't I say we don 't need Skripach ? Didn 't I say ? What will we buy Luts with now ? You 're a troublemaker , friend ... He 's worse . He 's simply Kyoo . Here 's a proposal . We find Skripach , and fly to the local Government ... Bring a little sand , friend ... We explain who we are , where we 're from ... They 'll give us a Gravitsapa , and we 'll organize some mutually profitable trade You give us yellow pants and we give you as much Ktse as you want . To fly to the Government - we need to have a Gravitsapa . The Government lives on another planet , friend . Uncle Vova ! I 'm here ! Here ... Skripach ! What ! Where is that thing ... Tsak ? Yeah I have it . So give it here ! Why here ? Just give it to me , I said ! There 's no-one here . That 's mine . So keep it ready . Are you asleep ? No . Don 't lose heart , Skripach . If there is a Gravitsapa on this Plyuk , we 'll get it . We 've been through worse Quiet ! Hey ! Stop ! Listen , give us a lift to the center ? Patsak ! Stop . What ? Don 't come any closer . Why do you want ? Give us a lift to the center . Three Chatlas .. No money ! But we 'll work for it ! And what can you do ? Me ? I can do everything ! And what exactly ? Vladimir Nikolayevich is a foreman , we 'll build you a house And what can you do ? Me ? He can play the violin ! Play ... Play . I can 't ! See you around , Patsaks . Miss ! Wait ! I can play ! Play ! Here ? There ! Wait ... I 'll adjust the sound ... Play . And sing . Wait , wait ! How does it go ... Mama , mama , what am I to do ... Cool ! What ? I said , ' Cool ! ' People like it . What ? People like it ! Let me be a drummer . How ? Foreman ! Skripach is unnecessary ! Don 't worry , he can be helpful . Give us some water to drink , eh ? I said , after the performance . We could take it by force . Then you 'd have to ask us . Oh ! Touch me - Ecilop will come and rip your legs off . I don 't give a damn about your Ecilop ! Calm down , Skripach . Don 't provoke the lady ... Foreman ! Look ... Alright , I got it . Listen , do you know anyone with a Gravitsapa and a Pepelats ? Why ? He could drop us off on Earth , and we 'd give you a big box of Ktse , and him ... I understand that your people don 't believe words , so what am I thinking ? ... that your wife is calling the morgues . No , what exactly now am I thinking ? That you 'd repay . Then it must be the truth . What idiot on Plyuk thinks the truth ? Absurd ! Because you say what you aren 't thinking and think what you aren 't thinking , that is why you are sitting in cages , and this whole bitter cataclysm that I am observing here , and Vladimir Nikolayevich too Patsaks are supposed to perform in a cage , so we sit in a cage . Why are you showing off ? It 's OK friend , we will sing beside the cage . Get in the cage , he saw us - he 'll Trankluk us . We 're not animals . What ? No you will get inside ! Get inside ! Let go ! You will get in ! Wait ! Get in ! Get in , or he will melt us ! Okay , let 's get in Skripach , seeing the way she is asking ... Get in . One two three ... Dance ! Dance ... You know , try to find another ensemble ... uncle . What ? I 'll be back . We 've got to get out of here . Boys , push the cart , it 's uphill . That we can do Give it some gas ! See you , bastards ! I 'll let everybody know ... what has become of this planet because of this buffoon PJ Patsaks are sitting on Chatlanian necks ! So , is everything there ? She stole the cologne . Woman ... Let me help . Have you got lead in there ? Let me , uncle Vova . I don 't even know where to look . Which way is Earth ? Galina Borisovna ! Mr. Mashkov and I , as Patsaks , could receive two Chatlas for a performance - at most . Water , Luts and bribes for Ecilops - a minimum of one Chatl a day . And a Gravitsapa costs half a Ktse ! That 's two thousand two hundred Chatls . Divided by 365 , take off Saturday and Sunday we get six . That means I couldn 't return sooner than in six years ! That 's all very well , Gedevan Alexandrovich , but these are just words . Where is the proof that you came back from outer space , and didn 't sell the violin as Professor Rogozin alleges , and spent all this time at a disco in Gagry ? Here 's a mineral . Here 's a Chatl . Here 's a Tsak . I attached the bolt and sand to the explanation memo and handed to Rayechka at Deans office , so that she would send it to UNESCO . Where ? UNESCO . You are a grown man , Gedevan Alexandrovich . You 've studied for one semester and disappeared for years ! Then you show up ... With some pebble , some chip of old Caucasus ceramics , and a fishing bell ! And you are demanding ... well , besides that , if you have musical talent , then why didn 't you participate in our amateur performers clubs ? You will excuse me , Skripach , but this is elementary Koo ( BS ) ! Part Two Abridged Chatlano-Patsak dictionary Ktse - a match Tsak - a small bell for the nose Etsikh - a box for prisoners Ecilop - representative of the goverment Pepelats - interstellar ship Gravitsapa - component of Pepelats motor Kyoo - a socially acceptable expletive Koo - all other words Hi . Hello . Long time no see . Bye . Hey ! Hang on a sec ! I 've got a proposal ! What ? What ? What are we thinking about you ? Well ? Read out minds . Why are you bugging us ? What do you want ? Have you no shame ? And you ? We are poor , unfortunate , starving artists ! What wrong have we done you ? Why do you torment us ? Give your Bandura here ... Tune up ... Like so . Come on . One , two. three . Mama , mama , what am I to do ? Mama , mama , how will I live ? I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have a warm clothes . Shut up , you 're tone deaf . Mama , mama , what will I do ? Mama , mama , How will I live ? Uncle Vova , let 's do it again . They like it ... They get it . One , two ... Ecilop ! Artists , where is our bucket of bolts ? Pepelats ? Yes . There ... Luts ran out . Because of you , bastard . Skripach ! What are you doing ? Hooligan ! Listen , leave me in peace , okay ? Friend , that is someone 's last breath , a grave It 's a graveyard ... Mate ! You said you were good He 's a braggart It was an unfair game You won through my brains If you had any brains , you 'd be studying at MGIMO , And not here pissing everybody off . Let 's play again For your violin , violin case , and tooth stick ... And this ! Okay ? Okay ! For your Bandura , Visator , and Mr. Uefs foundation of life We can Let 's do it ! Uncle Vova ... You need to turn the Tsapa . Then you do it ! Not allowed , I 'm a Chatlanian . Get out of here When it comes to advice , you 're all Chatlanians , When it comes to work , though ... Checkmate . Unfair game You deliberately thought bad moves for me ! You should play with your own brains then How can he play with his own brains , if he is seeing these dolls for the first time ? Not my problem . Give me my winnings . Yeah right ! Uef , have you ever seen that such a little Patsak could be such mercantile Kyoo ? Never . I was saying - Skripach is unnecessary . And here 's the result . Hey ! Boss ! ... And you were saying Tsapa ! So , on Earth , nobody sings in cages ? Mr Bee , on Earth , only animals sit in cages Are animals ... Chatlanians ? I don 't know . They are similar , in any case ... Is a nightingale ... Patsak ? Why a Patsak ? You said it sings without a cage . Well then he 's a Patsak . Ah ! So you see , you have the same unashamed racism as here on Plyuk . Except that the authority is not in the hands of Chatlanians , but Patsaks Just like you and your friend ... nightingale Let me ... Here , four gulps . Give water to the youngster . You owe us 6042 boxes . Skripach , make a note . I did already . Do you want some ? No It 's free . Hey ! What are you doing ? And me ? And me ? And me ? And me ? I 'll give you ten more boxes , take some water for yourself ... Kindza dza ! A boat ! It 's not a boat . It 's a Luts station . So lets refuel . We can 't . This one 's automatic , the next one has a woman attendant . We 'll sing and she 'll give us a discount , get it ? Quit slacking off , uncle Vova . Come on , come on , friend ... Come on ... If there used to be a sea here , why aren 't there any sea shells ? Do you still have seas on Earth ? Seas , and rivers , And honest people , Mr Uef . Savages . You make me want to cry . Mama , mama , what will I do , Mama , mama , how will I live , I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have warm clothes . It 's too bad my boss can 't see me now , He 'd probably give me a raise . Quiet , uncle Vova , she 's watching us . They took the woman out and put a machine in . So take what you can with the money you have . At least we 'll fly part of the way . Luts isn 't sold in parts . Luts is ten Chatls per load , but we have only seven . How far from here to the center ? 160 km . Uncle Vova , Uef has more Chatls , In the right shoe ... Hey , Chatlanian ! What ? Take off your right boot . Why ? Kyoo , you bastard ! Squat down ! Why ? They 're not Ecilops . It 's PJ with his Patsak . If they find out that you didn 't squat , it 's a life term in a box with nails . Who 's he ? Huh , did you see that ? Yeah , it 's a hologram , friend . The violin ! Calm down ! Stand still ! Quiet ! And you say Koo . It 's not a blimp , moron ! It 's the last breath of Mr PJ . Nonsense How could one person breathe out so much before death ? Absurd . Don 't blaspheme . PJ is alive ! And I am happy . And I 'm happier still . that 's it ... Come on , get inside . Plastic ? No . Is there no normal entrance into this supermarket ? The normal entrance you have to pay for with Chatls , friend . Let 's go , let 's go already ... Go away . Skripach ! Patsaks go there ! What are they doing ? This is Mr PJ 's fourth pump . I love PJ very much . I ' Koo ' him even more ! Here they make water from Luts . What are they yelling ? Trading . Trading what ? Trading everything . So lets buy a Gravitsapa !

Uncle Vova , what 's with you , friend ? Sorry , I forgot . There was no match . There wasn 't ... Life term in a box for both , without nails , but with a fine . The fine is 500 Chatls , 250 each . Thank you ! Patsak ! You glue the violin back together and sing the songs ! Skripach ! You work the Bandura ! Guys , we were just kidding with the match , we just wanted to make you happy . Good bye ... sings an old Russian folk song ... Earthman , Hello ! I am certain that one day you will reach this planet . Greetings from Vladimir Nikolayevich Mashkov , foreman from Moscow , and Gedevan Alexidse from Batumi , who were the first to set foot on these villainous sands in the back alley of the Universe . Brother Patsak , throw in some more of that plastic there is just water in there . Tell him to give me something else for it then Perhaps when you get here someone who knew me will still be alive . Tell them that I didn 't steal the violin . Look ! Good as new ! There 's another little bit left It happens ... It happens ... High calorie ? Earthmen ! How could you press the button like that ? I could barely find you . Good thing I have good memory . Here 's your sock back , thank you . If you want , I can take you back to Earth . I found out your number in Tentura . Only hurry , because one second here is half a year there . Then I have a proposal ... We transport to Earth now , Procure some matches , Come back here and sell them , Bail out our friends , We go to Moscow , and you go home . I can 't , I have only three charges left . That 's okay . It 's exactly enough times to go there , here , and back again . And me ? Listen , friend ... Decide it , yes or no ? I 'll count to three ... One ... Two ... Hold on a second , put yourself in my shoes They are in a box because of me . And my baby son already has a beard ! Two and a half ! Two and a half ! I ... I can 't do it . Three . Oh ! Who needs it all ? Tsak-schmak ! It 's all crap ! And we ... Where did you get this from ? Eh ? It was just laying on a shelf in the planetarium ... Skripach , my kleptomaniac , you 've stolen a Gravitsapa ! Patsaks ! Patsaks ! Why are you singing standing up here ? Standing up is allowed only over there . Ecilop wouldn 't let us in there . But here it 's only on your knees . Never mind You 've still got to pay us . Well , come on ... Come on , behave . Uncle Vova , your jacket is coming , in my hat . Hi ! How 's life ? What 's new ... on Plyuk ? Sing ! It seems I am out of voice today . Sing ! Vladimir Nikolayevich , I can 't take this any more ... Relax , Skripach . How much is that ? One hundred . Seems like we 've sung enough . And what 's that there ? Fifty . Ecilop ! Patsaks ! Why aren 't you in muzzles ? Turn around ! Orders from Mr. PJ - all Patsaks must put on muzzles ... and be happy . So , that 's for me and that 's for you . And that 's for you . Why aren 't you happy ? I am asking you Draw your weapon , Chatlanian . Put them on , then ... I 'm doing it ... I 'm happy . Ha ha . Oh , look , PJ is here ! Where ? Get up ! Get up ! Open your mouth ! Wider ! Skripach , gag ! Quickly ! Turn round ! Nose ! Give me the money ! Okay ... Hold this , like so ... And take that off If you think that this gadget is not a tranklukator it will be the last thought in your Chatlanian head ! Shortest route to the prison ... March ! Everyone lay down for half an hour ! Forward ! Forward ! Quicker ! Excuse us , Granny ... That 's PJ Mom Do you see that ? That 's him Everyone , into the tub , quickly ! Open the door . And stay there for 24 hours ! Koo , or not ? Here ... What number ? The latest . Hi Hey , Chatlanian ! Sing ! Stop it , Skripach ... Roll out the one next to last . Be gone ! Hello , Gedevan Alexandrovich . Gomardzhoba ( hello in Georgian ) . Come out . We can 't . They 'll catch us . Stop ! We have a Gravitsapa . Cut it . Right here . Throw your weight on it ! Uncle Vova ! Help me roll the box out ! Leave it ! Vladimir Nikolayevich ! Mankind spent a thousand years trying to get a little rock from the moon , and here 's a living extraterrestrial , and a box ... made of an unknown metal . Leave it , I said ! Tsapa . Ay ay , Tsapa . Tsapa ! It 's working ! So are we flying ? Seems like it . Brothers , hurry up , they 'll be after us soon ! Don 't interfere . We 've landed . Landed where ? Khanut . What Khanut ? Planet , where I was born on . And me . Night . It 's always night here now . Put this on for now . Why ? There 's no damned air here at all . So how do you live here ? Nobody lives here for a long time . The Plyuk 's trankluked it while we were away on a tour . Why ? Because we didn 't get them first . And why would you want to get them ? So that they wouldn 't be hanging over our heads . And everybody perished ? Of course . Vovka , I have a proposal . Right now planet Khanut is pennies worth . 63 Chatls . We go and sing ' Mama ' around the galaxy for a month , then the planet is ours . In another month - we 'll buy air . 93 Chatls . Those without air will be pouring in here . The air is ours . They 'll be crawling on all fours , and we 'll be spitting on them . What for ? For fun ! Where 's the fun in that ? He 's still young Half the planet 's yours , half ours . Okay ? Tempting , of course ... But we need to get back to Earth , guys . Come on , let 's hurry , the supermarket closes in half an hour . Vovka , you just relax ... Take a look . We 're here . Here 's Earth . And here 's Alpha . They make cactuses from us on Alpha . Earth is in anti-Tentura , friend . And there 's no way we can reach it , understand ? How can that be ? Just like that , my whole life I was unlucky Pepelats can 't get to Earth . Enough talking ... is that clear ? Let 's go divide the planet . You found this out at the planetarium ? Yes , friend . ... that 's why you stole the match Of course . They 're lying , uncle Vova . Don 't believe them . Take us to Earth , and that 's it ! No , Gedevan , they 're not lying . They 'd crawl on all fours across the whole Universe for those matches Vovka ! Don 't joke like that ... The oxygen here is two percent of normal . Gedevan ... Don 't , you 're still young . You should live still . Maybe things will change ... Skripach is not necessary , uncle Vova . Hey , Patsak ! You are going to kick the bucket now anyway , so tell the truth for once in your life . Why didn 't you go with that idiot when you could ? What did you want ? Crimson pants ? PJ 's pool ? Tell me , what ? Gedevan , you tell me . You can tell me , I am a friend . I had a Georgian mother . He says his Mom was a local Georgian . Uef ! Do as you wish , but I will ' Koo ' them to Alpha . And you , scruffy Chatlanian , put on your Tsak ! And squat when you speak to a Patsak ! Khanut is a Patsak planet , friend . Repeat once again . You eject us on Alpha , and try to brake in its orbit , and then ... Like hell we 'll be able to brake there . Don 't interrupt ... Go on , friend . On Alpha , when they transport us to Earth , we need to keep a finger on the bottom of the space travel machine so that it would stay with us . On Earth we should buy you four bulk packages of matches . Go on , friend . How many times do we have to repeat the same thing ? Let 's get going , if we are going ... I 'll be planted in a pot because of you for the rest of my life And you are too lazy to open your mouth an extra time Brothers ! Dear , good , friends ... Either let 's get going , or at least shut the door . I can 't stand the sight of you any more , I already feel nauseous . Farewell , friend . we are off ... Brake ! Brake ! Brake ! How can I brake when you drank all the brake fluid ? Alcoholic ! He 'll poison himself Turn off your antlers ! They won 't turn off . Then take them off . They 'll break It seems we 've landed . Just like last time . OK , put on your gas mask . What about Tsak ? No , they 'll have to tolerate us without it . Earth ! ... sings the same old Russian folk song again ... Nope ... not Earth . Hello ! We 're Patsaks from planet Earth . And you are ... ? This is planet Alpha . Tell your co-ordinates to Decont , and she will transport you to your point of departure . Best wishes . The number of your planet , if you 'd be so good . 013 in Tentura . It 's here ... Somewhere near here There . To the left of Ursa Major . That is not necessary . If you would , hold your hands . Miss , what did you do with those ... ? Into the small hall of the greenhouse . Please . You ... Hold your hands ! Do you really make cactuses out of people ? Only out of Plyukanians . Oh , but they 're not Plyukanians . They 're Khanutians . That is not important . Please put on the breathing masks . What for ? You have clean air . That is precisely why . Huh , get a load of her Calm down , put it on , Gedevan . In the name of my planet , I am begging you let them go , please Who around here could resolve this problem ? Abrodox . But ... So , take us to him . Go on , or else I 'll take my mask off and start breathing your air . You shouldn 't worry . Our greenhouses provide an excellent environment . Blossoming , micro-climate , quiet . it 's enviable Then why are you , darling , running around on the grass , and not sitting in a pot ? Would you be so kind to look where you are going you 've already stepped on three saplings . Friend ! We have a big favor to ask you . You can stop right there . No . Being neighbors with Kin-Dza-Dza is our misfortune . They are consumed with passions ... carnal . Continuation of their lives as plants is a blessing for them . And for everyone else . Perhaps we could send for them and ask them what is a blessing for them and what isn 't ? Well if we were to give them an opportunity to make decisions , then ... Missy , are you the most intelligent species ? Did someone tell you that , or did you decide for yourselves ? Let 's not waste time like this . You are creatures from anti-Tentura , Therefore , I am obligated to send you to your point of departure , or send you back in time to the moment when you can decide your own fate . Choose . Pardon , I didn 't catch that . To what time ? To the past ... on Plyuk . Let 's do it like this ... One back to Earth , and another to the past . Vladimir Nikolayevich , I won 't let you go to Plyuk alone . Listen , mister , send us back in time How much time did I spend glueing the violin together , about 50 minutes ? 50 minutes Brother Patsak , a guy with a sock is going to come soon Tell him to jump to prison for us . Do you know where it is ? Of course So you 'll show him where Give me something else then . Everyone rest for half an hour ! Thank you , friends . Keep playing , keep playing ... guys . Skripach , it 's time ! Again you haven 't left , Bastards . Again . Come out . No way . We are better off here than on Alpha . Go on , pull them out . Soon someone will bring as a space travel machine . Vladimir Nikolayevich , you owe us 11000 boxes . Skripach wrote it down . Eleven thousand and twenty . I have a proposal . Vovka ! You and I are transporting to the Supermarket now , and then after we 've bought everything ... There won 't be any ' after ' . We are going to Earth only . Forever ? Forever . Me , on a planet where they don 't even know who should squat in front of whom ? Nonsense Give us the Gravitsapa and do what you want . Uncle Uef . Uncle Bee . You 'll have such a reception there ... No , Gedevan ! When a society doesn 't differentiate based on the color of pants , then there is no point . And if there is no point ... Brothers . Enough philosophizing . He 's going to be here now . Come on , decide . With us or not ? Give us the Gravitsapa , OK ? Give it to him . It 's too bad Well , let 's say goodbye ... I got used to you , it seems Me too . Well , take care . Friends , Patsaks ! Here 's your sock , thank you . If you wish ... Friend ! What system have you got there ? May I have a look ? An ordinary system . Press the button and you are home . Hi Hi . What 's new ? pipes burst on Manohin 's site How 's the A student ? He 's out ... Vovka , pop out for some bread - I forgot , eh ? And pick up some macaroni ? Mister ... Mister , how can I get to Old Arbat ? That way , to the right . Thank you . ... Skripach ? Uncle Vova ? ... Skripach ! Uncle Vova ! Mama , mama , what will I do ? The End

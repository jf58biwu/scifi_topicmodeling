No ! That 's enough ! Do you want to use him or kill him ? Bring him up . Master , do what Ironbar says . I will . Yeah , I will . Savannah ! Finn , look . It 's him . I finded him . It 's Captain Walker . What 's his talk ? He ain 't made no wordstuff . It 's a long track . Maybe he 's burned out . Maybe . Maybe he 's just listening . Walker ? Hello ? Walker ? Maybe he 's talking , but we ain 't hearing . You see his lips ain 't moving . Not with wordstuff , with sonic . That ain 't never gonna work , sonic-bonic bullshit ! This here 's Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Can you hear me ? Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Come in . Is anybody out there ? Can you read me , Walker ? Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Come in . Is anybody out there ? Can you hear me , Walker ? What 's up , doc ? Hey , take me with you ! Can you hear me , Walker ? Fly , Walker ! Fly , Walker , fly ! Fly , Walker , fly ! Fly , Walker , fly ! Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Quiet ! Quiet ! Quiet ! Quiet ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Enough ! Enough ! Enough ! Enough ! Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? We 's the waiting ones . Waiting for what ? Waiting for you . For you . For you . Who do you think I am ? I think he be testing us . This a testing , Walker ? You reckon we been slack ? Well , I don 't know . Maybe you 've been slack . We ain 't . We kept it straight . It 's all there . Everything marked , everything ' membered . You wait , you 'll see . This you knows . I be First Tracker . And times past count I done the Tell . But it weren 't me that tumbled Walker . It was Savannah . So it 's only right that she take the Tell . This ain 't one body 's story . It 's the story of us all . We got it mouth-to-mouth . You got to listen it and ' member . Because what you hears today you got to tell the birthed tomorrow . I 'm looking behind us now ... across the count of time ... down the long haul , into history back . I sees the end what were the start . It 's Pox-Eclipse , full of pain ! And out of it were birthed crackling dust and fearsome time . It were full-on winter ... and Mr. Dead chasing them all . But one he couldn 't catch . That were Captain Walker . He gathers up a gang , takes to the air and flies the sky ! So they left their homes , said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers ... Bidey-bye . and what were left of the knowing , they left behind . Some say the wind just stoppered . Others reckon it were a gang called Turbulence . And after the wreck ... some had been jumped by Mr. Dead ... but some had got the luck , and it leads them here . One look and they 's got the hots for it . They word it " Planet Earth . " And they says , " We don 't need the knowing . " We can live here . " " We don 't need the knowing . " We can live here . " Time counts and keeps counting . They gets missing what they had . They get so lonely for the high-scrapers and the video . Videos ! And they do pictures so they 'd 'member all the knowing they lost . 'Member this ? Tomorrow-morrow Land ! 'Member this ? The River of Light ! 'Member this ? Skyraft ! 'Member this ? Captain Walker ! 'Member this ? Mrs. Walker ! Then Captain Walker picked them of an age and good for a long haul . They counted twenty , and that were them . The great leaving . " Rescue party departed at first light ... " led by Flight Captain G.L. Walker . " " May God have mercy on our souls . " They said bidey-bye to them what they 'd birthed . And from out of the nothing they looked back ... and Captain Walker hollered , " Wait , one of us will come . " " Wait , one of us will come . " And somebody did come . Walker . Walker . Walker . We 's heartful to you , Captain Walker . We 's ready now . Take us home . We kept it straight ! It 's all there , ain 't it ? Everything marked , everything ' membered ! Yeah , you kept it real good . You ain 't been slack at all . Why are we waiting for ? That ain 't me . You got the wrong guy . Quit joshing , captain . Yeah , catch the wind . We got to see Tomorrow-morrow Land ! Home ! Tomorrow-morrow Land ! Listen him ! There were places like these . Cities . They were called cities . Lots of them . Cities . Cities ! They had lots of knowing of a lot of things . They had skyscrapers ... Skyscrapers ? ... videos and they had the sonic ... But , then this happened . This ... This Pox-Eclipse happened , and it 's finished . It isn 't there anymore . You got to understand that , this is home ... and there 's no Tomorrow Land ... and I ain 't Captain Walker . This is it ! We 's loaded and waiting , captain . We got the wind up our arse , captain . Let 's go ! Who 's coming ? We 's pulling on a leaving . There ain 't gonna be no leavings . All that stuff 's just jerking time . We 's working it different . Ain 't you seen nothing ? He couldn 't catch the wind . There weren 't no skyrafting . There ain 't gonna be no salvage . This is our Tomorrow-morrow Land . He 's proof of that . Program ! All of you program . If he ain 't Captain Walker , who is he ? He ain 't no different to us , that 's who . He slogged it out on foot . If he can get here , we can get back . He ain 't much bigger than us . Copilot did it . So why can 't we ? That 's the trick of it . Who 's coming ? No ... Across the nothing ? Don 't you ' member ? When you finded him , he were half jumped by Mr. Dead . Nobody 's saying it ain 't a hard slog . We knows that now . If we wants the knowing the doing , there ain 't no easy ride . There ain 't no knowing and ain 't no doing ! There ain 't no skyraft and there ain 't no sonic . You slog out there to nothing ! Worse than nothing . The first place you 'll find is a sleaze pit called Bartertown . If the earth doesn 't swallow you up , that place sure as hell will . Listen him ! There ain 't no Tomorrow-morrow Land ! We done that ! He 's got wordstuff from his ass to his mouth . Whoever 's got the juice , track with us . Thanks . Now listen good ! I 'm not Captain Walker . I 'm the guy who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket . And I say we 're gonna stay here . And we 're gonna live a long time and we 're gonna be thankful . Right ? Keep tracking . Slake ! Get the others . Come . They 've gone . You got to get them back ! Come on ! They 've gone ! Scrooloose let them go . Savannah 's taken them . They 're in the nothing . Come on , you got to help me !

Half a night . Maybe less . They be deep in the nothing . Ain 't got much water . Makes no difference . They 'll be swallowed by the sand . You gotta get them back , captain ! Stop with the " Captain . " Stop . Stop the noise , will you ? Stop the noise ! I need as much water as I can carry . What are you doing ? I 's coming salvage for my buddies . We needs a hunter . He holds his own , okay ? Help ! Help me ! What ? Quick , let 's trek ! Is it Tomorrow-morrow Land ? No . Bartertown . It 's our only chance . Get in , we 're right behind you . Wait ! Stick together ! Where are we ? I can 't see nothing . It 's Bartertown . It stinks ! Tubba , Cusha , wait up ! Wait up ! Which way ? Head for the light . Where are the others ? They 've gone ahead . How far ? A long way . Can you see them ? Only just ! What are we doing ? What 's our program ? We 're looking for someone . In here ? This is jerking time ! A little guy , got the knowing of a lot of things . Understand ? Yeah . Yeah , well , shut up ! What 's to see , captain ? Shh ! Quiet ! It 's him , captain ! It 's the little guy ! Little ? He 's the smallest ! What the fuck , captain . What use is he ? Shh ! Quiet ! Where are the others ? Out there . Screwy , let 's fly ! Excuse me . Shh . Shh ! Hold it !

Where are you gonna hide ? Listen to me ! Bartertown will live ! Find the little man . Bring him back to me alive ! We will rebuild ! For those who took him , no mercy . So , what 's the plan ? Plan ? There ain 't no plan . Skyfish , look ! It 's got to be ! The sonic . Gekko got it straight . This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Come in . Do you read me ? Over . Come in . Do you read me ? Delta-Fox-X-Ray . Come on , over . Do you read me ? Welcome . Open your book at page one . Now repeat after me . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . Where are you going ? Where are you going ? Where are you going ? I am going home . I am going home . I am going home . I am going home . Aah ! He 's got the man ! Pigkiller ! Wait ... Blackfinger ! Pull the pin ! Do it now ! Hold it , Blackfinger ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Aah ! Give him back ! Let go ! Let go ! Blackfinger , let go ! I 've got you now . We 're going home ! You 'll be all right . Come on now ! We 're gonna count to three . One . What happened to two ? This is a stickup ! Anybody moves , and they 're dead meat ! Oh , I think we 're all dead meat ! Dad ! Dad ! We 're dead meat ! We 're dead meat ! Dad ! We 're dead meat ! Okay , son . Quick , get in the plane ! Okay , now . Which way did he go ? I warned you , Dad ! Follow me ! You ! Me ? You . It 's your lucky day . It is ? You got a plane . I have ? It might just save your life . It will ? All right , let her go ! Come on , come on . What 's the problem ? We 're not gonna get off the ground . We 're overloaded ! Dad , you better do something ! Kick her in the guts . Not gonna make it . There 's not enough runway . We haven 't got any choice . Between them ... and us , there 's not enough runway . There will be . Agh ! Well . Ain 't we a pair ... raggedy man . Goodbye , soldier . This you knows . The years travel fast . And time after time , I 've done the Tell . But this ain 't one body 's Tell . It 's the Tell of us all . And you got to listen it and ' member . 'Cause what you hears today , you got to tell the newborn tomorrow . I 's looking behind us now , into history back . I sees those of us that got the luck and started the haul for home . And I ' members how it lead us here ... and how we was heartful because we seen what there once was . One look , and we knewed we 'd got it straight . Those what had gone before had knowing of things beyond our reckoning ... even beyond our dreaming . Time counts and keeps counting . And we knows now ... finding the trick of what 's been and lost ain 't no easy ride . But that 's our track . We got to travel it . And there ain 't nobody knows where it 's gonna lead . Still and all , every night we does the Tell ... so that we ' member who we was and where we came from . But most of all we ' members the man who finded us ... him that came the salvage . And we lights the city . Not just for him ... but for all of them that are still out there . Because we knows there 'll come a night ... when they sees the distant light ... and they 'll be coming home .

 [ music continues ] [ camera clicking ] [ metal grinding ] Mr. Wagner ? ( man on speaker ) Get off my property . Mr. Wagner , I 'm a college student . Get out ! Get out ! I 'd sure appreciate an interview . Lies ! You have been warned ! [ camera clicking ] Oh , Henry . Wanna go for a swim ? - I 'm sorry , I can 't right now . - Hold on . Well , it 's no big deal . Lana , I wanna hang out . I just don 't have the time . I hate to swim alone . Okay . Maybe later . Oh , it was just Henry . Um , I 'll talk to you later , Betsy . Bye . Hey , Clark . - Hi . - Hi . Um , wanna go for a swim ? - I can 't . - Yes , you can . I-I can 't . I 'm supposed to meet TJ . - Not gonna happen . - What do you mean ? He 's off for another scoop of the month . We planned to go to the scrap yard . I hope you 're joking . A scrap yard ? You two are really weird . No . They sent a pledge to the scrap yard to lift a bumper off a car . Came up with a wild story of the scrap yard attacking him . Can I have my hot dog ? I think it 's pledger 's imagination running wild . Not the scrap yard . - C 'mon , let 's go for a swim . - What are you doing ? Mr. Wagner ? [ intense music ] [ engine revving ] Lana , he shouldn 't have gone by himself . We 're a reporting team . Fine . So , you and TJ are a reporting team . - You and I , are a swim team . - No , don 't- - Help ! [ laughing ] Help ! Help ! [ theme music ] Clark ? Clark . ( TJ ) Help ! ( TJ ) Help ! Didn 't you notice the " no trespassing " signs and the locked gate ? I 'm a reporter . Should 've gotten permission . Yeah , I wouldn 't have gotten it . Right now , I have something more pressing on my mind . That 's why I couldn 't find my glasses . Oh , Clark . Where were you ? Looking for my glasses . If that 's your idea of a joke , it 's sick . Oh , this is your idea of a joke ? Yeah , it is . Clark , you 're not gonna believe what just happened to me . I know you went out by yourself again man , I appreciate that . Hey ! Won 't you listen to me ? I 'm sorry . That maniac Wagner just tried to kill me . Mr. Wagner ? He wouldn 't even hurt a fly . Yeah ? If it wasn 't for Superboy , I 'd be buried in a ton of junk . That 's a nice man ? Listen , he 's very scary . - He looks like a skeleton- - - Oh , he 's overweight , TJ . Yeah , well . If he 's overweight , I 'm a sumo wrestler . - Yeah . - I like that . He 's helps out a lot . Like when we campaigned on drug abuse . Remember the car that was totaled by Arthur .. - Omanoff . - Omanoff , yeah . When he was high on crack . And ended up in Wagner 's junk yard . So what ? He towed it to the campus free of charge . He put this sign on it . " Crack kills . " Talk about effective . For weeks nobody took a hit of anything . That 's fine , Lana . But that 's ancient history . Modern times , the man is a psycho . Fine , I 'm callin ' the cops . - You can 't , TJ . - Yeah ? Well , watch me . Hey , what Mr. Wagner needs is a friend . Go tell that to TJ . TJ .. I 'll see you guys later . [ intense music ] Mr. Wagner . Mr. Wagner . [ music continues ] That 's nice , give me two more . Come on . - All the way , on your own . - Two more . One more-one more . - Clark . - Alright . Rack it . Rack it . - I 've been looking for an hour . - Well , you found me . - We got trouble . - Oh , we got trouble ? - Lana , Miss Social Worker ? - She went to the scrap yard ? Yeah , with some food for that weirdo . Now , come on . She 's gonna get herself killed . [ clearing throat ] TJ , you go get to a phone . What do you mean get to a phone ? I got the car running , let 's go . Mr. Wagner . Mr. Wagner . [ dramatic music ] Mr. Wagner . [ music intensifies ] ( male # 1 ) Lena ! Oh , Mr. Wagner . Lena , you 've come back . Remember , it 's Lana ? Lana Lang . I-I brought you some food . Yeah , come . Come right inside . - I can only stay for a moment . - Yes . How long has it been since you 've had anything to eat ? I eat what I can find . But , there 's a supermarket two blocks away . - Do you have money ? - I have money . But who dares to go out ? They throw stones . I heard about that . They 're just rowdy kids . No , no , not kids , Lena . Grown ups . Men , women , children . People who were once our neighbors , turned on us . You 're confusing me with somebody else , Mr. Wagner . My name is not Lena . It 's Lana . Lana Lang ? Oh , my poor liebchen . That 's the way of the Gestapo . They brainwash . Taking away your identity . To make nothing of a person . Mr. Wagner , World War II 's been over for more than 40 years . There is no more Gestapo . That is their method ! They twist minds . Making you think of things that never happened . In their drive for power , they will destroy the human race if necessary . I should 've stopped her ? When was the last time you stopped her from doing anything ? Forget I asked . You stay put , TJ . And keep the engine running . I 'm gonna grab Lana and we 're out of here . Alright ? Well , watch out for that monster machine . I 've gotta go , Mr. Wagner . I 've got a class that starts at 3 o ' clock . No , no , no , no ! I let you leave once , I will not make that mistake twice . You must stay here where I can protect you . [ siren beeping ] - They are here again ! - No , that 's Clark . Don 't worry , Lena . I will not let them get you . Go away or you will all die . [ dramatic music ] You will never get my granddaughter again . Oh , Clark . Don 't worry , Lena . They 'll never take us alive . Stop it . Look , you 're killing them . Yes . So they won 't kill us . - No , please . - No . - Mr. Wagner ! - No ! [ explosion ] The power is off . I-I must see what it is . Stop ! [ music intensifies ] Superboy . This is getting a little repetitious . [ dramatic music ] You stay here , I 'll find them . What are you doing in here ? Mr. Wagner , look . Look at your picture . In the Daily Planet . Look . Look at the date . Fifteen years after the war . Have I not told you how diabolical they are . How they brainwash ? My barricades . They are breaking through . They 're smashing our defenses . Mr. Wagner , listen to me . Mr. Wagner , listen to me . Listen to the Daily Planet . - Do not be afraid , Lena . - I 'm not afraid . And there 's no reason for you to be afraid anymore . Look . " Professor Wagner is one of the survivors " of the Auschwitz concentration camp " where he was the subject of inhumane medical experiments . " He is to conduct a series of lectures at Metropolis University . " [ soldiers marching ] [ men shouting orders ] [ metal creaking ] Mr. Wagner . We still have one way . [ music intensifies ] You are safe now , Lena . ( Mr. Wagner ) If anybody comes through that door three hundred pounds of dynamite will blow up in their face . What about us ? We die with it . With dignity and honor . No ! That is a mistake . This is all a terrible mistake . Are you alright ? But , Clark , he 's dead . No , he 's not . He 's alright . Are you sure ? We gotta get some help for Mr. Wagner . You 'll never get her ! [ gunshot ] Lena , Le-Lena , I .. I 've failed you again . I 'm sorry . There was no other way . He 'll make it . - He mustn 't be blamed . - Nobody should be blamed . Let 's be grateful nobody was killed . The bomb squad is diffusing Mr. Wagner 's dynamites . Let 's get out of here before they make their big mistake . Yeah , let 's go before something else goes wrong . Clark , I thought you were being- - Where the hell were you during World War III , huh ? Superboy , he saved me . I wonder how he always knows when we 're in trouble . He can bend steel and fly , maybe he can read minds . Bye , Mr. Wagner . Do I know you ? Oh , yes-yes . You 're the girl . The one who wanted the rights for your school campus . Poor old man . Guess the excitement was just too much for his heart . It wasn 't the excitement , TJ . He couldn 't find a place to hide from hate and persecution . Superboy fights hate and persecution . Yeah . But there 's only one Superboy . Yeah , there 's only one . I 'll see you guys back at the dorm . Feel like walking . [ melancholic music ] ( Lana ) Hey . I think I owe you a hot dog . How about it ? - Why not ? - Come on . [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

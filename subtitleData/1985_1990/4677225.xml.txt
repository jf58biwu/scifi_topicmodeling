 [ Music ] [ Rhythmic Drumbeats ] [ Music ] [ Drumbeats Continue ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Singing In Native Dialect ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Okay , swing . That 's it , swing . Nice and level . Put it in there ! [ Native Dialect ] Run ! Run ! Wrong way ! First ! First ! Wrong way ! Other way ! Other way ! Go , go , go , go ! Hold it ! Hold it ! [ Man ] Telephony ! Hey ! Telephony ! U.S. ! [ Indistinct Chatter ] These guys are great natural athletes . Jerry , they 're developing ... their own unique style of baseball here . I could file on African baseball on a regular basis . - Maybe , you know , do a feature or ... - Yeah , that 's fine . But enough of these African baseball stories . George , there 's an opening on the sports desk . How soon can you and Suzy get back here ? Um , about a week . - When , when do you want me to start ? - Hey , man , we need you by Monday . - Do you want the job or not ? - Yeah ! Uh ... Get the cheeseburgers ready , Jerry , because I 'm gonna be home by Christmas . - Thanks a lot , buddy . - See you soon . All right ! Ooow ! [ Whistle ] Susan ! I 've got real news ! Wait till I tell you . I don 't wanna miss Eric . Well , that 's downright Jurassic . Fourth or fifth cervical vertebra , don 't you think ? It 's a neck structure of a brontosaurus . - Small head , slender neural cord . - Let 's carbon-date it . - We could . - I 'll get it ready . Paris or London ? Shall I send a telex ? - You could . - What 's wrong ? This bone is about 80 years old . No . There 's no point in showing me that , Susan , my dear . I wrote it . Don 't you remember ? This , I think , is more what you should be looking at . Oh , no . It 's not a giraffe . - Or am I just a total idiot ? - On the contrary . You 're the brightest post-doc we 've had out here . Don 't worry about it , my dear . - I thought I really had something . - Excuse me . - Susan , may I speak with you ? - Hello , George . I 'm afraid that your wife has had a slight scientific disappointment . - You all right ? - It 's okay . I just wanted to find something real important before I left . Susan , you know that most field work is patience and frustration . You 're young . Don 't rush it . In other words , some days you eat the bone ; other days , the bone eats you . Come on . Hi , Nigel . Ready to sharpen his pencils today ? - Must you always be sarcastic ? - Au revoir , Nigel . Is that Little Miss Scientist 's latest discovery ? Yes . From Bateke . She 's top-notch at her job , Nigel ... whether you like her or not . - Is it any good ? - I doubt it . Now don 't patronize me , Eric , please . I know that look . How good is it ? [ Eric ] She knows nothing . If these scrapings are from Bateke , I imagine the photo is true . - A trip is indicated . - You do know that Etienne is dead . Oh , yes , terrible thing . Fine scientist . Well , are you going to tell her that we 're going to Bateke because of her scrapings ? No , I 'm not , and neither are you . Mmm , the beer that made Ogbomosho famous . How about that ? I can finally say " Ogbomosho , " and we 're going home . The Post is really lucky to get you . It 's great . It 's just ... I have the funniest feeling about this bone . Susan , we made a deal . I wanted to do something real while I was here . We 'll start our real life when we get home . What 's that supposed to mean ? You know . - A baby . - Sure , couple , three , four . - Four ! - I 'm one of six ! - Well , then , you have ' em . - Well , I 'd give it a shot . Carl Yastrzemski Loomis . That 's got kind of a rhythm . Jane Goodall Loomis , maybe . Hmm , that 'd be all right . As long as she could throw a spitball . - I wanted to find my own dinosaur . - You 'll have a reason to come back . We 'll miss you . - I 'll write . I promise . - Do that . - Good morning . - Morning . I heard about your husband 's job . Congratulations . Absolutely splendid . It should suit him . As you know , I can help you in Washington . You choose any school or museum you like ... and you 'll get the highest possible recommendation . Thank you . I really appreciate it . One thing before you go . Dr. Pierre Dubois from the Red Cross ... is in the lab office . Could you have a chat with him before you leave ? Sure . Of course I will . - Are you leaving , too ? - Just for a few days . In fact , we really should get going . Chop , chop . - Well , very best of luck to you . - Bye . Do you know anything about the Senuofo , Dr. Matthews ? - No , not really . - They are quite remote . Ten days ago , a government patrol discovered cholera at one of their villages . They brought back two patients , both , uh , died . It was not cholera . It was staphylococcus . It 's , uh , food poisoning . Do you understand that Dr. Kiviat and I ... - are paleontologists , not physicians ? - Oh , yes . But the Senuofo have eaten the same diet for a thousand years . There 's never been a recorded case of staphylococcus before . They have eaten an animal they can 't or won 't identify . This , uh ... is what they ate . - Can you identify it ? - Giraffe . It 's impossible . It 's not a mammal . Listen , George , it 's hardly even a detour . We catch the ferry , see what 's going on . It puts us back a day and a half , maybe two ... Which are the first two days of my new job . They 've been getting the paper out without you all this time . They don 't need you Monday . Dealing with food poisoning is not your job , Susan . No , that 's not my job . But finding out what 's with these bones is my job . Turn off the light . George , it could be an entire skeleton . It could be a major find , my find . Go to sleep . I said , turn off the light , Susan . We gotta get up and pack tomorrow . [ Smacking ] Damn ! Susan ! Susan ! No ! Bitch ! Pardonnez-moi . Was there an English woman on that thing ? - Une femme anglaise ? - Definitely . Is there any way I can charter an airplane ? Oh , definitely . - All right , let 's go , right now . - Next Thursday . - No , no , no , now . Rapidement . - Next Thursday . Isn 't there any way I can get upriver fast ? I have a friend who has got a very fine airplane . Would you like to charter it ? Yes , definitely . Kenge Obe offers a variety of package expeditions ... tailored to the individual tastes and schedules of the patron . I seem to be out of brochures at the moment . I 'm surprised this thing can even fly ! Oh , yes . Well , that is because of the skilled ability of the pilot . How far ? How long is it to Sangha ? A long ways . Long , long ways . But don 't worry . We have plenty of outward fuel supplies . Kenge Obe is always prepared for every contingency . - And this ... - Shit . The finest of your kind music . Bon appetit . You like it ? [ Music ] [ Rock And Roll ] [ Music ] Then she leaves me a note like a goddamn milkman or something . I mean , I gave up six months of my life to come tagging along ... in this godforsaken country , six months of my career ! - If you look to the left , [ indistinct ] - I 'm sure it 's not godforsaken ... if you come from here , it 's just that ... sometimes she 's like talking to a stone wall . - You know what I mean ? - [ indistinct ] Tried talking to her about having kids ! My God ! You 'd think it was some kind of barbaric custom from dark ... I 'm one of six brothers and sisters ! - Is that so ? I myself had 19 . - Nineteen ? Yeah , my father had , uh , four wives . Four wives ! I got all I can handle with one ! I can 't let her get away with it . What would you do ? If it were my wife ... I 'd whip the bitch . [ Music ] [ Rock And Roll Continues ] [ Music ] [ Chanting ] [ Chanting Continues ] [ Chanting Continues ] Susan . Got your note . George , he 's dying . Dr. Dubois , this is my husband , George Loomis . - Monsieur . - Bonjour . Oh , this is my tour guide , Sky King . - Do you understand Senuofo ? - Yeah , I speak a little . We 're trying to find out what this man ate . That 's the chief . He 's preparing to die . - No , no , no , no . No ! - Huh ? - [ Native ] - [ Native ] [ Native ] [ Native ] Two of their hunters found it upriver . - Dead . - [ Native ] [ Native ] They have brought the meat back and everyone who ate it is sick ... or dead . [ Native ] Looks like a brontosaurus . [ Native ] Where ? Where upriver ? George , thank you . You should bloody well tell me my messages as they come in . - Okay . It is not okay . You make things very difficult . Okay . Eric . Apparently your favorite post-doc and her husband ... are now chasing their bone at a Sangha village upriver . - Where did you get that information ? - Dubois . - Red Cross . - Damn it . Blast it ! We 're at the wrong place . Get me government house . Tommy ! - What is going on ? - You 'll find out in due course . We 're going to need a boat and an escort . Tommy ! She 's a persistent little devil , isn 't she ? If this is where they left the carcass , then it should be here . Sounds logical . It must have washed with the current . We 're gonna have to look over there . What 's downriver ? Hey , Charlie . [ Speaking Native Dialect ] [ Native ] No problem . You won 't get lost . This is the Kenge Obe communications module . There 's a transceiver . There 's a transmitter chip . You can ... You can beep each other . Also , the wraps and radio , plus this excellent guide . Rent or buy ? Food is extra . I 'll be back to pick you up in two days . Make it a rental and tell him he goes with us . Hey , Charlie . [ Native ] - [ Native ] - [ Protesting ] No problem . [ Susan ] Oh , my God ! George . Hey ! Where are ya going ? [ Native ] " No problem . " What a place , huh ? Something big 's been through here . Look at those broken branches . - George ? - Come on . Oh , my God ! [ Native ] - Hello ? - [ Native ] - [ Native ] - [ Native ] Amigos . [ Yelling , Laughing ] George , maybe you should give them something ? - We would like to give you a gift . - Huh ? What would you like me to give them , Susan ? Show your watch . Show it . Show them how it ticks . It doesn 't tick . It 's a goddamn digital . Try it anyway , George . - You like my watch ? - [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping ] [ Native ] Have any other ideas ? [ George ] Oh , terrific . It 's a convention . Maybe they 'd like my ... pants . It 's what they could use . [ George ] Susan ! - Susan ! Don 't ! Their soul ! - It 's okay . It 's just a picture . It 's okay . Come on , it 's all right . [ Woman Laughing ] Think happy thoughts . [ Native ] Mmm . [ Gulp ] This is absolute " craporama . " Dead ants . Live ants . I think I 'm going to die . Ah . Here , uh , try a little half-eaten hippie food . [ Sniffing ] [ Crunching ] - [ Whispering ] - [ Chuckling ] Mmm . [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] I don 't like it either , boss . - I 'm George . - Huh ? - My name , George . - Cephu . Cephu , how do you do ? [ Native ] [ Crying ] You okay ? [ Crying ] [ Kissing Sound ] It 's okay . [ Music ] [ Drumbeats ] This I like . [ Native ] What is this stuff anyway ? Near beer . It 's near enough . [ Susan ] George ? I feel really strange . Me too . [ Native ] Have you seen this thing ? [ Hissing ] George , did you see that ? - What 's with him ? - [ Drums Stop ] Hey . - They just disappeared . - [ indistinct Moan ] - Listen . - [ Moaning Continues ] George , you hear that ? Do you hear that ? [ Whispering ] That 's an elephant or something . Hello ? Where 'd everybody go ? I always like to thank the host of the party before I leave . Come on , let 's set up a tent . Those guys just disappeared into thin air . And that sound . I don 't know . It could have been a hippo , except hippos don 't ... make a trumpet sound like that . - Spooky , huh ? - Yeah . I 've never heard anything like it , George . Whatever it was , it 's gone now . - Now ? - Why not ? 'Cause the natives might be outside still . They can watch . [ Indistinct Rumbling ] It 's a little earthquake . It stopped . - [ Indistinct Noise ] - The wind ? The wind . Kind of nice how the jungle makes noises at night , isn 't it ? Crickets and stuff . - Yeah . - [ Crickets Stop ] Yeah , not everybody gets to experience this . It 's a marvelous opportunity . George , you 're not sorry you 're here , are you ? No , no , no . Really , Susan , I 'm not . George , I don 't know if I 'm in the mood anymore . Do you mind ? Oh , come on . [ Indistinct Animal Trumpet ] [ Susan Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Animal Moaning ] - [ Moaning ] - Whoa . [ Music ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Music ] [ Loud Rock ] [ Music ] Would you be very kind ? Thank you . - [ Protesting ] - Oooh ! [ Laughing ] Thank you very much . Oooh ! Is this absolutely essential , Colonel ? They are fighting men , Professor . They need their diversions . I wish you were looking in an area the government controls . The natives are scared of the Mokele-Mobembe . I don 't think they 'll present any problem . - You aren 't frightened ? - On the contrary , my dear Colonel . I 've been on its trail for far too long . We 're like old friends . Besides , we have our military escort . [ Gunfire ] - [ Rumbling ] - Listen . Come on . Oh , George . Oh , my God ! It 's beautiful . Get down . The wind 's at his back . He can 't get our scent . I need pictures . Get my camera . Quick ! Susan . [ Camera Clicking ] - George , look . - I see . - It 's the female . - How do you know ? George , it 's a hatchling . It is . It really is . Take pictures . Take pictures . We 're looking at 150 million years ago . My God . You realize you 're gonna be the most famous scientist in the world ? And you 're gonna cover it . [ Camera Clicking ] [ Roaring ] They might be great , but I don 't know how friendly they are . [ Braying ] [ Cooing ] What I don 't understand is what they 're doing this far south . What I don 't understand is what they 're doing alive . Ready ? Maybe they ran out of this fruit where they used to live . - Think that 's enough ? - Yeah , okay . Following the food supply . You know , George , that 's not bad . - I guess we can get a little closer . - You know what we 've got to do ? We 've got to get them used to us so we can stick one of Kenge 's radio chips on them . Jump back , Jack . Woo ! Look at you ! Aah ! - George of the jungle . - Come on . - [ Growling ] - Chow time . They 're getting used to us . Great . They love it . [ George ] That 's it , guys . Pig out . [ Cooing ] Hey , look . Behind you . The baby . Terrific . You can put the transmitter on him . - Hey ! Hey , you ! Leave that alone . - [ Braying ] Oh ! Susan , he 's got big teeth . Where 'd he go ? [ Squawking ] - You see him ? - He 's underwater . On the right . George ? George ? [ Screaming ] Here , Baby , it 's all right . It 's all right . God , George , you scared her . No , no , no , stay here . - Real funny . - Come on , it 's okay . It 's all right . Some food . Come on . No , no , wait , wait . Here , here , here . No , no , come on . Hungry ? Free meal . That 's it . Is it ... Look at you . Are you friendly ? You like that ? Yeah . Look at these ears . Wow . Yeah . Whoa , don 't step on me . Came to visit us . Yeah . She 's like a little elephant , isn 't she ? It 's playing . Dinosaurs don 't play . - It 's weird . - Isn 't her skin nice ? I thought it would be more scaly . Well , you 're not so bad . You 're kind of friendly . Yeah . - [ Growling ] - What the ... [ Eric ] Use the tranquilizer gun . In the neck . Aim carefully . [ Eric ] And another . In the neck . [ Snarling ] Give it time . [ Cheering ] [ Growling ] Get back ! Get back ! Colonel , don 't shoot ! [ Yelling ] [ Nigel ] Oh , no ! Stop them , for god 's sake ! [ Growling ] [ Growling ] [ Moan ] [ Growling ] [ Moaning ] [ Eric Whispering ] What an animal ! Millions of years . Have you any idea what you 've done ? - That was a one-of-a-kind specimen . - No , Professor . It was one of two . That is a one-of-a-kind specimen . Get down ! Susan ! - Don 't go over there . - [ Moan ] - Shh . Keep her quiet . - Keep her quiet ? - She 's trying to get to her mom . - Quiet ! Keep her here . Kiviat , what in the hell are you doing , man ? I was under the impression you were a scientist . What ? You gonna have it stuffed ... right here on the spot ? Mr. Loomis , you will kindly keep your mouth shut . - Secure the creature . - Yes . - Don 't do it , Nigel . - Well , I ... - Oh , my God ! - Your prisoner ? We do not take prisoners . [ Rifle Cocking ] Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! - Agh ! - Take cover ! - [ Shouting ] - Move ! [ Gunshots ] Susan ! Run , Susan ! Yeah ! [ Native ] Still want to set up your field lab here , Professor ? - We 'll have to take her back . - [ Chuckling ] [ Cooing ] [ Cooing ] [ Squawking ] [ Growling ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] They did a job here , didn 't they ? What a mess ! They got the radio . - The receiver 's okay . - This works . [ Moaning ] Oh , God , George , look ! Doesn 't have much of a chance , does he ? She 'll never survive without her mother . Baby , come here . Baby , Baby , come on . No , no . - Come on , Baby . Come on . - [ Kissing Sounds ] - [ Growling ] - [ Susan ] Come on , come on . Come on . [ Braying ] You know , George , if we caught it , maybe we could beat Eric back . It could be our discovery . [ Moaning ] [ Moaning , Sniffing ] [ Growling ] [ Growling ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Moaning ] - [ Moaning ] - [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning Continues ] [ Cooing ] [ Tape Rewinding ] - Here . - Got it covered . All right , that a girl . Don 't hurt her . - [ Snarling ] - Ow ! She bit me ! - [ Growling ] - [ Grunting ] - Hold on to her , George ! - I 'm tryin ' ! - Hold on ! - Grab her ! Grab her ! [ Susan ] I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! George , hold her back . It 's okay . It 's okay . - Shh . - [ Grunting ] It 's okay . Calm down . It 's me , see ? Look , it 's me . Shh , shh . You 'll be okay . Shh . You 'll be okay . She 'll take a bath . You 'll be fine , Baby . [ Cooing ] It 's okay . It 's all right . Shh . [ Chanting ] [ Growling In Time With The Chanting ] - [ Growling ] - Don 't do that , idiot ! [ Eric ] Oh , my God , she 's had more than 200 CCs already ! Help me ! Help me ! Come on , you blockhead ! Take the rope ! - She 'll have to have a stimulant . - I have it . Help me up . Right . Well done , Nigel . Really . You must excuse my assistant , my dear Colonel . Heat of the moment . You know , I 'm , I 'm beginning to take an active interest ... in your career and , uh ... you know I have the aid of the president . One day I should like to see you " General " Nsogbu . For all our sakes , we mustn 't lose this one , must we ? Lose one , you keep one . I call that acceptable losses , Professor . [ Whimpering ] [ Moaning ] [ Growling ] - [ Whimpering ] - What 's your problem ? - Are you still hungry ? - [ Groaning ] She already ate 200 pounds of of malumbo fruit . Oh . Who said you had to make such a pig of yourself , hmm ? You 'll be okay . - Okay ? - [ Groan ] [ Whining ] [ George ] Oh ... Get him outta here . Ow ! Get off my toe ! She wants ... - Oh , get off my foot ! - She 's not feeling well . She 's just a baby . It 'll be all right . - Oh , what breath ! - Shh . [ George ] Good God ! - Come on , George . Come on ! - Heave , heave ! [ Groaning ] George , will you stop fooling around ? Come on . Aah . She 's still hungry . [ George ] Why 'd they put these so high up ? [ Ripping ] Shoot ! There goes my pants ! Wasps ! Wasps ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow-ow-ow ! I don 't think we 're that far from where Kenge dropped us off . If he waits for us , I think we have a shot at beating Eric . Nifty . Ow ! - Still hurts , huh ? - Look at the size of this sucker , huh ? [ George ] Oh , yeah , that feels nice . - You like that , huh ? - Work your way up right there . Up , up , now to your left . Right there . - [ Cooing ] - Yuck ! Come on , Baby . Come on , come on . - Not now . Go on , go on . - No , no , no . Get outta here . [ Cooing ] Hey , hey , go on . Get outta here . - Leave my shirt . Get outta here . - Out of here . Play with ya later . [ George ] Come here and plant one on me . - Oh ! Oh ! - Oh ! - French-kissed my nose ! - [ Laughing ] - It kissed me . - No . - [ Whining ] - [ Susan ] No , Baby , no . Dragon breath . Get outta here ! - [ Moaning ] - Come here . [ Moaning ] [ Moaning ] George , Baby ... Where 's Baby ? Baby ! - Oh , God ! - I 'm sure she 's right around here . Baby ! Baby ! I don 't know how she 'll feed herself , George . She can 't reach the malumbo . We 'll just have to keep looking . - [ Beeping ] - Wait a minute . - I got something here . - Baby ? - [ Beeping ] - Yeah , she 's over that way . [ Beeping ] [ Helicopter Engine Whirring ] [ Susan ] It 's Eric . - Do you think they have Baby ? - I don 't see her . Could have gotten the signal from something else over there though . - [ Moaning ] - [ Susan ] Oh , look at the mother . - We have to help her . - What do you suggest ? - We walk in there with a writ ? - We have to try . [ Indistinct Chatter ] Don 't you worry . We 'll get you back to your baby . I can 't get these ropes . You 'll have to use your knife . - [ Sniffing ] - I know you miss her . I miss her too . - She smells Baby on your belt . - Huh ? You used it for a leash . - [ Growling ] - [ Native Shouting ] [ Shouting ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] - Come on ! - I 'm coming . Halt ! Halt ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! They were attempting to steal the people 's discovery . [ Native ] It 's really great , Eric . Is this paleontology by the books ? Welcome to the People 's Army . - Hey , watch it ... - Hey ! You will stop telling people what to do . That 's a very bad habit you people have got . You are not a citizen in this country . You 're a criminal and you have no rights . If that is not clear , we will make it clear ! [ Native ] - What is the matter with those two ? - They 're in a bit of a pickle . - [ Moaning ] - [ Native ] [ Moaning ] Open up . So ... a brontosaurus hatchling . Amazing find . Remarkable object for study . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I ... read your notes , my dear . Your behavioral observations were most impressive . A little unschooled , but written on the run , I realize that . You 've attached a homing transmitter to the hatchling , have you not ? It can 't be too far away . I think we can track it down . A hatchling . That 's very dear to me . I 'm going to find it . You 're going to help me , aren 't you ? Hmm ? Good night . [ Indistinct Chatter ] - [ Nigel ] Eric . Eric ! - Go away . No , listen . It 's the animal . Her heartbeat 's irregular . The breathing 's impaired . I told him no more tranquilizers . All he ever thinks about is being made a general . Now he 's planning to airlift her by crate in a helicopter . She 'll never survive it ! Oh , Eric , what are we doing ? Go to bed , Nigel . Sleep . I 'll have a chat with the colonel . [ Eric ] Colonel ! - May I ? - What is it , Professor ? - More debate about your prize ? - Nothing of the sort . She 's become rather restive and I have just prepared some of this ... very special serum but it doesn 't fit our instrument . May I ? Please . Thank you . This is our ... very best stuff . Guaranteed to reduce her to near death . Thank you . And , uh , total immobility . - Oh , spare me your sarcasm , Professor . - Certainly . [ Muffled Groaning ] [ Native ] Oh , good morning . What appears to be the problem ? They say that we killed the colonel . - We found this in their belongings . - That confirms my suspicions . - CIA is what they are . - What are you talking about ? They 're trying to prevent us from taking back the people 's discovery to the capital . It 's a plot to undermine the revolutionary government . You 're outta your mind . [ Native ] No ! - Oh , my God ! - Don 't shoot ! We need them . There 's a treasure buried out there . We can track it on our radio receiver , but we do need them . - What kind of treasure ? - Gold . CIA . CIA always has gold . Hidden . [ Whispering ] Could be yours . [ Beeping ] I think we 're on to it . Lower . - [ Sniffing ] - [ Helicopter Engine Whirring ] [ Moaning ] [ Whimpering ] There it is ! Here ! What is this ? - Is that your treasure ? - That , my friend ... is the most valuable thing on earth . But you said gold ! Give me that gun ! Try for the neck . Don 't ! Aaah ! Jump ! Turn back . Turn back ! Hey , babe . How ya doin ' , huh ? How ya doin ' ? Come on , we gotta go . Come on , come on ! Let 's go , go ! - Let 's look for someplace we can hi ... ! - George ! What 's down there ? There 's a cave . Come on , Susan . Come on , Baby . I can 't see . Gotta have light . I 'll make a torch . - [ Engine Whirring ] - Listen . They 're landing . Come on . It 's okay . That 's it , Baby . Come on . Get a move on , you fellows ! Not so fast . - [ Growling ] - Quiet ! Quiet ! George , Susan , show yourselves ! - Shh . Come on . - [ Eric Shouting ] All I require is the hatchling . - [ Screeching ] - What is that ? Oooh ! Ah , George ! Oh , they 're getting in my hair ! George ! [ Growling ] Watch your eyes ! Come on ! [ Screeching ] Aaah ! [ Rifle Shots ] Don 't ! You 'll hit the animal . Come on . [ Gasping ] Ow ! Oh , my God ! Damn it ! Oh , George . Oh ! The game is over . Hold this ! Go ! Don 't ! [ Gasping ] Ohhh ! George ! - Susan ! - George ! - We made it ! - - We made it , all right . We made it ! [ Susan ] Where 's Baby ? Baby , are you all right ? [ Screeching ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Twittering ] [ Sniffing ] - What 's she doing ? - I don 't know . Hey ! Hey ! Over there . [ Baby Braying ] Susan ! Susan , there 's nothing we can do . [ Sniffing , Sad Moaning ] Well , she 's alive . I said that 's all I wanted . That 's all we should want . There , there . [ Growling ] Hello , George and Susan . I can 't see you , but I 'm sure you 're out there somewhere . It 's better for science that we have the mother and the hatchling . I 'm most profoundly grateful to you . Take care of yourselves . Bye-bye . [ Groaning ] I don 't know what she sees in these things . I think I was starting to believe we were her parents . I didn 't do that many drugs in college . They 're probably gonna dope her silly . A bunch of grad students giving her a physical every ten minutes . That 's what I was gonna do . But she likes you . [ Native ] [ Buzzing ] [ Buzzing ] - Mokele-Mobembe . - Mokele-Mobembe ? Come on . - [ Native ] - Hey , you are late ! And guess what I saw downriver ? Your dinosaur ! We steal it back . It won 't be easy , but Kenge Obe doesn 't worry ... - because it 's no problem ! - No problem ! Right ! [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Moaning ] How is the little one ? She 's just so scared . I 've given her some morphine . Splendid . Absolutely splendid . [ Man ] Fire ! Get our equipment ! Move ! Damn it , move ! [ Shouting ] [ Shouting ] Still no Kenge . We 're just gonna have to wait . Halt ! Stand guard . Trigger ! Cephu ... [ Yelling ] [ Native ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] - [ Native ] - [ Shouting ] Let 's go . [ Machine Gun Fire , Shouting ] Aaah ! - Look , George ! - It 's about time . - All right ! - Yeah ! [ Machine Gun Fire , Shouting ] Oh . No problem . - Now . - Why not ? [ Grunting ] - [ Wailing ] - [ Roaring ] Sic ' em ! [ Roaring ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] Come on ! [ Roaring ] - [ Wailing ] - [ Roaring ] Hold on ! [ Wailing ] [ Snarling ] [ Crying ] [ Groaning ] [ George ] Stop ! Pull over ! [ Susan ] Stop , Eric ! [ Tires Screeching ] [ Susan ] I 'm warning you ! [ Eric Screaming ] [ Grunting , Groaning ] God . Oh , God . [ Rumbling ] - [ Roaring ] - [ Eric Screaming ] George . [ Moaning ] [ Growling Gently ] [ Moaning ] George . Oh , thank God . [ Cooing ] [ Sighing ] [ Contented Growling ] - [ Grunting ] - Baby ... you don 't belong to me . Just another legend ? If we let it be . Come on .

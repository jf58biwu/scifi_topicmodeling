Holy shit . You see , while we were in the future Biff got the sports book , stole the time machine , went back in time and gave the book to himself at some point in the past . Look . It says right here that Biff made his first $ 1,000,000 betting on a horse race in 1958 . He wasn 't just lucky . He knew , because he had the race results in the Sports Almanac . That 's how he made his entire fortune . Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass . MARTY : The Almanac . Son of a bitch stole my idea . MARTY : He must have been listening when I ... It 's my fault . The whole thing is my fault . If I hadn 't bought that damn book none of this would have happened . - It 's all in the past . - The future . Whatever . It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused and why the time machine must be destroyed after we straighten all of this out . Right . So we go back to the future and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine . We can 't , because if we travel into the future from this point in time it will be the future of this reality in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother , and in which this has happened to me . No . Our only chance to repair the present is in the past at the point where the time line skewed into this tangent . In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality , we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances of how , where , and when young Biff got his hands on that Sports Almanac . I 'll ask him . [ Suspenseful music from TV ] Bulletproof vest ! Great flick ! Great frigging flick ! The guy is brilliant . What the hell 's going ... - What the hell are you doing in here ? - Party 's over , Biff . MARTY : Sorry , ladies . How did you get past my security downstairs ? There 's a matter we need to talk about . - Yeah . Money , right ? Well , forget it . - No . Not money . Gray 's Sports Almanac . You heard him , girls . Party 's over . Start talking , kid . What else do you know about that book ? First you tell me how you got it . How , where , and when . All right . Take a seat . Sit down ! November 12 , 1955 . That was when . MARTY : November 12 , 1955 . That was the date I went back ... That was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm . You know your history . Very good . BIFF : I 'll never forget that Saturday . I 'd picked my car up from the shop because I 'd rolled it in a drag race . I thought you crashed into a manure truck . How do you know about that ? My father told me about it . BIFF : Your father ? Before he died . Yeah . Right . So there I was , minding my own business . This crazy old codger with a cane shows up . He says he 's my distant relative . I don 't see any resemblance . So he says , " How would you like to be rich ? " So I said , " Sure . " So he lays this book on me . He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event this century . All I have to do is bet on the winner and I 'll never lose . So I said , " What 's the catch ? " He says , " No catch . Just keep it a secret . " After that , he disappeared . I never saw him again . He told me one more thing . He said , " Someday a crazy , wild-eyed scientist ... " ... or a kid may show up asking about that book . " And if that ever happens ... " [ Cocks hammer ] [ Self-satisfied snicker ] Funny . I never thought it would be you . Biff , you 're forgetting one thing . What the hell is that ? You 're dead , you little son of a bitch ! [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Elevator bell rings ] - There he is ! - Wait , kid ! [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] LACKEY : Hurry ! There he is ! [ Dramatic instrumental flourish ] BIFF : Go ahead , kid . Jump . A suicide will be nice and neat . What if I don 't ? Lead poisoning . What about the police , Biff ? They 're going to match the bullet with that gun . Kid , I own the police . Besides , they couldn 't match up the bullet that killed your old man . You son of a ... BIFF : I suppose it 's poetic justice . Two McFlys with the same gun . [ Surprised gasp ] Idiot . [ Engine whirring ] What the hell ... Nice job , Doc ! MARTY : You 're not going to believe this . We 've got to go back to 1955 . I don 't believe it . [ Adventurous instrumental music ] MARTY : That 's right , Doc . November 12 , 1955 . Unbelievable that old Biff could 've chosen that particular date . It could mean that that point in time contains some cosmic significance as if it were the temporal junction point of the entire space-time continuum or it could just be an amazing coincidence . DOC : Damn ! Got to fix that thing . All right . Time circuits on . What do you mean , time circuits on ? Doc , we 're not going back now . What about Jennifer ? What about Einstein ? We can 't leave them . Don 't worry . Assuming we succeed on our mission this alternate 1985 will be changed into the real 1985 instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie . Jennifer and Einie will be fine . They 'll have no memory of this horrible place . MARTY : Doc . - What if we don 't succeed ? - We must succeed . [ Electrical explosions ] MARTY : This is heavy , Doc . It 's like I was here yesterday . DOC : You were here yesterday , Marty . Amazing , isn 't it ? Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes . DOC : You go into town . Track down young Biff and tail him . Sometime today , old Biff will show up to give young Biff the Almanac . Above all you must not interfere . Let old Biff believe he 's succeeded so he 'll leave 1955 and bring the DeLorean to the future . - Right . Once old Biff is gone , grab the Almanac anyway that you can . - Remember , our futures depend on this . - You don 't have to remind me of that . DOC : Here 's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact . I 'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit . That way , we don 't risk anyone else stealing the time machine and I won 't risk accidentally running into my other self . MARTY : Other self ? DOC : Yes . There are now two of me here and there are two of you here . DOC : The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955 . The other me that helps the other you get back to 1985 . Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower ? That doesn 't happen until tonight . Be careful not to run into your other self . Let me give you some money . [ Marty whistles in awe ] DOC : Have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities . DOC : Get yourself some ' 50s clothes . MARTY : Check , Doc . Something inconspicuous . Doc . Come in . This is Marty . Over . - DOC : Roger , this is Doc . Are you there ? - MARTY : Yeah , Doc . I 'm at the address . It 's the only Tannen in the book , but I don 't think this is Biff 's house . It looks like an old lady lives here . GRANDMA : Biff ! BIFF : Yeah . GRANDMA : Where are you going , Biff ? BIFF : I 'm going to get my car , Grandma . GRANDMA : When are you coming back ? I want you to rub my toes . BIFF : Shut up , you old bag . KIDS : Give us our ball back . BIFF : What ball ? KIDS : That ball ! BIFF : What are you talking about ? KIDS : Give us our ball ! BIFF : Ball ? BIFF : Is this your ball ? KIDS : Yeah ! BIFF : You want it back ? KIDS : Yeah . BIFF : Go get it . Doc , it is Biff 's house . I 'm on him . Over . [ The Four Aces ' Mr. Sandman plays on soundtrack ] MECHANIC : She 's all fixed up , but I couldn 't get her started . MECHANIC : Got a kill switch ? BIFF : You just need the right touch . BIFF : Nobody can start this car but me . MECHANIC : The bill comes to $ 302.57 . BIFF : $ 300 ? $ 300 for a couple of dents ? That 's bullshit . It was horseshit . The whole car was horseshit . MECHANIC : Jones wanted $ 80 to haul it away . BIFF : I bet he resold it . BIFF : I got to get something . MECHANIC : You want something ? You can call Jones and if he wants to give you a refund ... $ 300 ! If I catch the guy that caused this I 'll break his neck . The manure . I remember that . MECHANIC : 4 cans of Valvoline . BIFF : 4 cans for a $ 300 job ? MECHANIC : I can 't have lunch in there . MECHANIC : Makes me nauseous . BIFF : I should get a case for $ 300 . MECHANIC : It smells worse than the bathroom . The stench is never going to go away , Biff . Last time I do you a favor . Last time . [ Girlish laughter ] [ Oohs and ahs ] BABS : It 's perfect , Lorraine . You 're going to look so good ! BABS : You 're going to look ... BIFF : Look at what we have here . Nice dress , Lorraine . Although I think you 'd look better wearing nothing . LORRAINE : Take a long walk off a short pier . BIFF : There 's that dance at school tonight . Now that my car 's fixed I 'll give you the honor of going with the best-Iooking guy in school . I 'm busy . - Doing what ? - Washing my hair . That 's as funny as a screen door on a battleship . Screen door on a submarine , you dork . Biff , somebody already asked me to the dance . Who ? That bug George McFly ? - I 'm going with Calvin Klein , okay ? - Calvin Klein ? No , it 's not okay . - You 're going with me , understand ? - Get your cooties off me ! When will you get it through your skull ? You 're my girl . I wouldn 't be your girl even if you had a million dollars ! BIFF : Yes , you will ! It 's you and me , Lorraine . DRIVER : Watch it ! It 's meant to be . I 'm going to marry you someday , Lorraine . Someday you 'll be my wife ! You always did have a way with women . Get the hell out of my car , old man . You want to marry that girl ? I can help make it happen . - Who are you , Miss Lonely-hearts ? - Just get in the car , butthead . Who are you calling butthead , butthead ? How did you do that ? Nobody can start this car but me . Get in the car , Tannen . Today 's your lucky day . [ Tires screeching ] [ Frantic screaming ] BIFF : Watch where you 're driving , old man . If you dent this car , I 'll kill you . BIFF : This cost me $ 300 ! OLD BIFF : Would you shut up about the car ? - How do you know where I live ? - Let 's just say we 're related , Biff . That being the case , I got a present for you . Something that 'll make you rich . - You want to be rich , don 't you ? - Yeah . Sure . Right . That 's rich . You 're going to make me rich ? You see this book ? This book tells the future . Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of this century . Football , baseball , horse races , boxing . The information in here is worth millions , and I 'm giving it to you . That 's very nice . Thank you very much . Now , why don 't you make like a tree and get out of here ? It 's leave , you idiot . Make like a tree and leave . You sound like a fool when you say it wrong . All right , leave . And take your book with you . Don 't you get it ? You could make a fortune with this book .

All you got to do is bet on the winner , and you 'll never lose . All right . I 'll take a look at it . OLD BIFF : You damn fool ! Never leave this book laying around . Don 't you have a safe ? No , you don 't have a safe . Get a safe . Keep it locked up . Until then , keep it on you . BIFF : What are you doing ? OLD BIFF : Don 't tell anybody , either . OLD BIFF : There 's one more thing . One day , a kid or a crazy old man who claims to be a scientist is going to come around asking ... I 'm trapped . Doc . MARTY : Doc , come in . - What 's the report ? - Biff 's gone .

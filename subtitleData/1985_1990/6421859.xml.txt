 Edison Carter to Network 23 . Network 23 , are you receiving me ? This is Network 23 , intermittent device [ ... ] . Edison Carter to Network 23 . Come on , clear this link ! Network 23 to Edison Carter : OK , we have a link strong and clear . Your show goes live in two minutes . - Your controller is Gorrister . - Thank you , 23 . Hello Gorrister . Gorrister here , Edison . Are you about the incident ? Descend then , I 'll guide you once clear of the chopper By the way , you 've got competition . It 's quite a scene down there . No one before I 'm on air . 30 seconds . We 'll make it . This is Network 23 . This is Network 23 " A Network That Means This " is now transmitting live to the world . The award-winning Edison Carter , on the " What I want to know . " - Three ... two ... one ... go ! This is Edison Carter , asking the questions you want answered . Right now what I want to know is this : Just what happened in apartment 42 in the last 60 minutes ? What I want to know is : who is suppressing the story ? What is it somebody doesn 't want us to know ? Come with me , live and right now . Let 's go and get some answers . Alright , Control , I 'm going in . Gorrister , do you have an update ? All we have is : it 's an explosion in the area [ ... ] toward the residence . OK . Come to the eyewitness . Three ... two ... one ... go ! Well , that 's reporters and Metro Police everywhere ... There was an ' orrible noise and a woman come runnin ' out . They 've took her [ ... ] Hello . No one here tell us why we 've got to stay indoors . Alright , Control , I 'm getting out of the chopper now . OK . From your position go North , 300 . Building 84B . Security on the main door , so I 'll take you in on the east side . - Setting up time [ ... ] . - OK , Control . I want you to turn right . OK , Edison , there is an intersection ahead . Go upstairs , and it 's on the second floor . - Number 42 . - You got any update on that ? Apparently the wife 's been hospitalized . Yes . But Carter is right at the scene . What ? ! [ ... ] goin ' on air ? On what authority ? Put Carter out . Put him out ! Hi , Patrick . Hi , Edison . This man said , " through-here-we-no-go " . It 's typical . First time ever we get to a story before you , Control just pulled us out ! Gorrister ... Gorrister , I 'm calling you on the link ! How come this story is pulled ? It 's just come down to Murray . I 'm not dropping this one , Gorrister . Something smells . Gotta go round the back and see if I can access a window . Edison , it 's pulled ! Come on in ! Gorrister ... Gorrister , Gorrister , you maniac ! You ... ! Oh Jesus , I don 't believe it ! Gorrister , I 'm in ... ! Gorrister ! Right , yes . Bye . Gorrister , you do not leave me , or anybody exposed down here . - Hey , Edison , what is the problem ? Easy ... - The problem is almost got KILLED ! - The job was pulled , I pulled you in ! - You cut me out ! And no job is over until I am back at base , you little idiot ! Edison , come on . Won 't take this " Pretty Madonna " crap . Not even from the Great Edison . LET ME PASS ! [ Leave me alone ] Murray . It 's my ass down there , NOT HIS ! Now look . Just give me a controller that can do the job . Just want somebody who can keep me alive out there , - the best . - Okay , okay . - The best ! - Listen , Edison ... I was out there once , I know how you feel , but it stops THERE ! It 's the big , isn 't it ? I don 't know . It was ... pulled from high up ... very high . We 've succeeded in pulling Edison Carter off there , Mr. Grossman ? Yes , fortunately our instructions were carried out in time . [ Turning out to ] ratings . We have every cause for satisfaction . Overnight ratings Channel 23 ... low 1.5 million , high 2.36 million which keeps us top network . Projections for the next hour are excellent . Let 's move to the ... ' blipvert ' problem . We may have to suspend ... the use of 'blipvertisments ' , temporarily . There have been , as you know , these ... side effects on viewers . However , returning to conventional 30-second advertisements ... will once again give viewers time to switch channels ... with the consequent dip in our ratings . The very thing that Bryce designed blipverts to prevent . The Zik-Zak corporation very keen to press ahead ... buying air time , using our blipverts . Right now we are the only network that have blipverts . Unless we use them ... Zik-Zak might deal with our competitors . I do not intend to lose our major client . There 's probably no connection with blipverts . By good heavens , isolated incidents of this phenomena have occurred throughout history . People do sort of blow up . Spontaneously combust , you know ? No . I don 't . We need some more informed opinion on the matter . So I avast Bryce to meet us on the video link . Now he 's our top man . I want you to leave him absolutely to me . - Hello there , Bryce . - I need to talk to you abou ... - I 'm rather busy . I 've succeeded in computer generating a parrot on the screen . Oh , my congratulations . Whatever next ? It squawks . Um ... I wonder if you could find time to , a ... illustrate to the board here this little hitch we have on your blipverts . Put simply - the human body has millions of nerve endings . Each carries an electrical charge ... individually - very tiny , but in combination - surprisingly large . Normally , people burn it off , but ... in inactive people , it just builds up . Now , because I designed blipverts to compress a 30 seconds of advertising information into 3 seconds ... It appears the brain violently stimulates these nerve endings . Simultaneously . In some subjects it causes a short circuit . Some particularly slothful , [ ... ] , literally explode . Simple as that ! I 've got rather good example of one , on this Rebus tape . It won 't be set down simple if blipverts go global . My God . Look here , the only people who are THAT inactive are pensioners ... the sick ... or the unemployed . I take it that your Rebus tape is in an extremely safe place . Of course . But , look , it 's not my problem . My brief was to find a way to stop channel switching . I mean , you know - I only invent the bomb , I don 't drop it . We think it might affect sales if , um ... people begin to ... suspect . Well , don 't tell them , then . Unfortunately , one of our reporters may have got ... quite near the truth . We have to be very careful . Ah , fire him . The cruelest - kill him . Theora , I 'm putting you with Edison Carter . He is the best we have at Network 23 . I think , volatile , but good . Yes , I heard . And what was that story he was pulled from ? A-ha , Edison , this is Theora Jones . I managed to [ ... ] . While I 've warned her you 're a charmer . - Hi . Oh , how 's the head ? - It 's fine , how is yours ? Right , we do want to start . No trouble , or I stock your pocket money . You know the rules . Yes , we do . What do you say we start by breaking one ? So you can get on this rush of reporters being pulled off hard stories for no reason ? Edison ... Sort of , um ... access the inaccessible ? Edison , leave it ! Now back off , I mean it . Given the kind of material you normally bring in , what 's so special about some microwave oven going hot ? Oh come on , Murray , since when the people guard exploded microwave ? Right , let 's have a go . Hey , there is no way through there , that 's the executive level . I know . Let 's try up through the plumbing system . From the lower level , where there is no security block . [ What the ] hell . I accessed the security systems Mr. Carter asked . This place is about as inaccessible as I can get . I 'll leave you two together . Alright , Theora , what do you get on the line , apart from the dirty pictures ? Um ... there is missile missing from AKG . - That 's hot , isn 't that ? - Uh-uh . Oh , an assassination of a whole medic team in Bolivia . - How about that one ? - Give it to Joe . Bryce is a problem . [ He 's one of ] these computer-generating people ... [ ' cause he doesn 't ] want to know about blipverts . And we ... must keep him on air , then . Unless Bryce can 't sort out that effect , we simply can 't use them . You 've seen the Rebus tape , it 's just terrifying . We 've no choice . We committed to the campaign . And the Zik-Zak Corporation 's advertising contract - well , this is massive . Massive or not - if this gets out , Network 23 is in serious trouble . They 've been too damn close to the truth twice already . Theora , run that again , that last part . Network 23 is in serious trouble . They 've been too damn close to the truth twice already . Did they , now ? - What 's that crew doing on the roof ? - Camera 5 , [ ... ] Um ... the party that covering Ben Cheviot 's departure to New Tokyo to sign this big Zik-Zak contract . This promises to be one of the most momentous meetings in the history of communications . Oh , [ ... ] I should say , the history of communications of the world . And we are looking forward to a long and happy association . I 'm sorry , Mr. Cheviot , we had a camera problem . We 'll do that again , please . We 've always felt that the viewers are most importa ... Hey ! What do you guys think you 're doing ? This is MY story . - You wanna go back to Control . I 'll handle this one . - [ ... ] , it 's all yours I understand , sir , you 're off to New Tokyo to finalize that Zik-Zak contract . Well , um ... yes . This will be a major partnership between Network 23 and ... What 's the ' blipvert problem ' ? - What ? Good God , man , it 's completely out ... - Too damn close twice already . Eh , Mr. Cheviot ? The problem is whether I can trust you . You see . We 've just heard that ... How much of that you got , Control ? Are you busy tonight ? Maybe all night . Mister Carter , we hardly know each other . Rebus . Um .. I think that 's a kind of puzzle . Mysterious pictures . Pictures . Alright . Where am I in relative to you , Control ? You 're five floors above me . I 'm getting all clear on the security system . Hang on , Edison . Just a few moments . OK , hold your position ... Stand by . We have the level . Got a problem . I 'm at the entrance , but I need the code . I know , I can see you . Right , now , it 's Bryce Lynch ... 7.10.88 . Libra , might have guessed . OK , try B-Z-2-U-H . Uh-uh , try again . Right . Oh . How about 1-J-2-F-I ? Jesus ... Yes , we 'll do that . Yes , sir . Of course , there will be the ... usual expenses . We can do that . Yes , sir . Got a nice [ eyesight ... ] , then ? - It 's the parrot man again . - Another one ? He must eat them by the dozen . Where are we going to get one at this time o 'night ? Squaawk ! Not a parrot . A nasty little burglar . To be cornered . And perhaps , hit . - How about playback unit ? - What did you say ? Try the playback unit . How did you know ? [ ... ] Even clever ones . - I know all about it , boys . - Um , I just bet you do . Camera check , please . Edison . Edison , for Christ 's sake ! I 've lost picture . What 's going on ? Shhhit ! Shit ! Did it go ? [ ... ] it 's unbelievable . You gotta get out of there . Move . [ ... ] turn right . What 's the problem , Control ? Intruders . Two . They activated the alarm in the elevator . By the way , they are armed . Oh , great . Any idea who they are ? No , but they are outsiders . Not network men . Is this a change of plan , Control ? No change , I 'm standing by on basement camera . This is Level 6 . I 'm going up . Look , I don 't want to be difficult , but ... we are going the wrong way . 126 coming up . If those guys are up there ... OK , go ahead . Go left . Away intersection . Do not cross the intersection until command . OK , go . Edison , there 's somebody else in the system . My bike ! Quick , the van ! Well , he smashed my bike . We made a deal , Mr. Breugel . Why ? He saw the Rebus tape . He is the best known reporter on air . His show is top-rating prime-time . It 's satellited globally . And he saw the tape , Mr. Grossman . Do you know what you 're saying , Bryce ? I run a television network , Bryce . - Not a goddamn hit squad . - It 's quite rational . Keep Carter on ice in a cryogenic unit . On ... ice ? Meanwhile , his reports keep coming in for a while , so no one will question his sudden disappearance . Bryce . I don 't want to appear ungrateful ... But how do we keep his reports coming in , huh ? - With seance ? - No . I compute the physical characteristics of his head ... then I print his memory , his synaptic circuits . His ... synaptic ... circuits ? His mind , you know ? The brain is only a binary computer , a series of on-off switches . Then , Mr. Grossman ... I can generate this man onto the screen from my computer . He 'll be able to continue his program , and no one will know . But he will , in fact , be computer-generated . Just like the parrot . - The parrot ? - Squaawk ! Yes , supervisor , please . Supervisor . Yeah , I 'm chasing Mr. E. Carter . That 's Edison Carter . - Ident number ? - Um ... personal Ident code ... 74928BDG6629 . - Incident ? - Yeah , auto accident , section 5 , area 23 . No , we have nobody answering that description . This coffee stinks ! Stinks . Odorous . [ ... ] . Offensive . Offense . The guilty party will be reported to network president , Mr. Grossman . This is an automatic complaint system . I can dump down all the information in the mind ... and replay it at will . Then I can eliminate any information I don 't want . My parrot squawks in much the same way . My research funds must not be starved . I have to have time and money . - Do you ever sleep , Bryce ? - Only physically ... Ha-ha-ha ... For the moment , the computer power is only enough to generate a human head ... too many coordinates for the rest of the body ... which naturally won 't be needed . This is the future . People translated as data . Does this thing reproduce a mass of reporters , all that I 'm concerned about ? This whole situation is becoming very disturbing . These circuits are randomizing a little . It 'll settle , though . I need more time on the recode generator . It 's bouncing . It takes a while for the framestore to read out all the information . Max ... Headroom ? Goddam it ! Get that babbling clown off the screen ! Kill it ! What kind of a scrub is this ? - This is a joke , right ? - Leave it alone ! Don 't you dare touch him . Him ? This junk is a machine . This is not Edison Carter . It is a ... computer-generated geek ! It is useless . You understand me ? I understand your opinion , Mr. Grossman . Then understand this : You abandon that garbage . You apply this unit to the crucial matter of the blipvert problem . I want that resolved , and I want it fast . This ... Parrot Project terminates now . Perhaps you do not understand the potential of this development ! I understand the potential of this situation . This electronic oaf has a record of what Carter saw in the Rebus tape . Smash it . Carter here has the same information . Although relucting [ ... ] , somehow we must get rid of him . I do so hate wasting an employee . I 'll have Breugel and Mahler handle it . They really performing good works . I don 't like that , Mr. Bryce . The little shit 's too clean . - It gives me the creeps . - Cleanliness is next to the godliness . That young man got some brain on him . Be worth a bob or two . Not a great pay , [ ... ] , Mr. Bryce . Nice head , though . The body is still alive ? He 's a bit alive . Nasty knock in the head , but ... Hey , hey , hey - silly boy . Who 's a silly boy , eh ? Hands are rare and expensive items , worth more than cameras . Low-date . Nightingale Body Bank [ ... ] [ ... ] That 's it . They 're short at Nightingales . Mr. Bryce didn 't say " kill 'im " , did he ? No , but he did say " get rid of him " , though . What 's the bonus for a live dead body ? Clinical brain death , only carries 20 points . Yeah-yeah , but he 's still warm . There got to be value in that . There is . 20 points . Goodbye . [ ... ] that one . See ya , folks . Live on arrival . Very tasty angle there . Opens up possibilities . What we gonna do with Mr. Bryce 's little toy here ? Well ... he said he wanted it safe . And he wanted it in good hands until he needed it . He did , yeah ? He said that ? Right . Right . Wonderful . You are tuned into the Wild Society . This is Big-Time Television . Day after day making the morning seem like yesterday . Yes , we said that ... there 's no future . Well , this is it . This is Blank Redge talking to the Blank Generation . [ ... ] live from Big-Time Television . - Reg - And the next ... . - more of the same . - Reg - Reg ! - Shhh ! Have a nice day . What 's up ? What is a cross-hatch generator ? - Don 't know . - We 've been billed for one . Ah , yeah . Oh , let 's take anything [ ... ] I think it was some [ ... ] Reggie , darling , how do you expect me to run my business like this , hm ? - You don 't help , you know ? - Well , they were cheap . Hey , why don 't you just write it : " Money in , money out " , and leave it at that ? And if the credit terminal wants to see the figures , what do I do , huh ? Just wave the back of the old envelope at them ? You smoke too much , Domi . Reg ... if you didn 't nail your jeans to the floor every night , it escaped . So don 't talk to me about personal habits . We have just got to find something better ... - then those bloody old video kits . - Don 't ! Just because they are free , doesn 't mean to say they are good , you know ? I like ' em . Blah-blah ... Big-Time TV ... challenge . - What ? - A word in private , Reg . Nice to see you , Reg . We have get something for you-u-u . - Very special thing , yeah . - Yeah . You being an expert . You just press this white button here and keep things in . Things ? What the bloody hell is it ? Actually , it 's the red button . No , it 's the white . But you got to plug it in , you know , Reg ? Never would 've known that . - How much ? - Oh , well ... - Hello , Mahler here . Can I ... - Mr. Breugel . Nightingale 's here . That body you sold us was taken ... Um ... Sorry , Reg , bit o 'business . Um ... Talk about the transaction later , right . Try the goods surplus [ ... ] . Hey , hey . Leave it . We have got inconvenience . " T 'is now the very witching time of night , " when churchyards yawn ... " " and hell itself breathes contagion to this world . " " Lady , shall I lie in your lap ? " No , no , I mean ... my head upon your lap . If he smashed his hand , it still 'd be up the body bank . It 's gonna cost us as is ... Have you seen a blond man with a camera ? Excuse me , have you seen a man in a gown , carrying a camera ? He 's escaped from the Body Bank . Thank you very much . A Bright Broadcasting Good Morning Television ... First up , Dr. Duncan [ ... ] , the Video Symptom Show . Theora . And it 's giving me absolute agony . Just pull off your [ pants ] against the legs , would you ? Theora . Edison ... Edison , for God 's sake , where are you ? Keep transmitting , I 'm locating you . Morning . I need your address . I 'm in bad shape . Hello . Nice to have your visit . Please enter code . And while you were out , these were your message . Digital watch tunes . You can enjoy them all on this cassette . Remember ... and ... and the classic ... There 's many , many more on " Digital Watch Tunes , Volume 2 " Available now , from Zik-Zak . Hello there . Call this number and find out what an incredibly nice guy God is . He won 't keep you waiting on the line , he won 't hang up on you , he 's sitting by ... My God , what happened ? You don 't even know what it is . It could be anything . Might even be a bomb . Plus ... what did it cost , Reg ? It 's free . If it doesn 't work , we throw it back . If doesn 't work on what ? Christ , Reg . Can 't afford even a decent program ... let alone a cross-patch rota-vator thing , whatever it 's called . Geronimo ! Go on . Go on ! Th-Th-thi-this-this ... This is live and direct ? Li-Li-Li-live ... why am I on air ? N - n-n-can 't identify station . Enter data . Go on , Reg . Enter ... " Big-Time " . This is ... live and direct on-on-on - ... bi ... big ... big ... time . - Am I on air ? - Bloody hell . - I 'm beggin ' your pard 'n ? - Hey ! It 's speaking to us . You say something . Um ... talk to it . Hello , mate . I 'm Reg . This is my partner , Dominique . Bi ... Bi ... Big Ti-Time . Hi . Both of you . Welcome to-to-to - " Big-Time " . You want to check these ratings ? It seems we have an audience of two . Great . Terrific . - Where 'd they get this ? - Hey . What 's it for ? Hello and welcome to Big-Time Television . Live ... and direct . It 's Big-Time Television . The station where ... two is a company and three is an audience . - Where does it get all this from , Reg ? - En-en-ent ... ent - ... data ! - Data ... data ... data ... - Un-bloody-believable . THE CHAOS IS NOT HELPFUL ! Please be seated . Ben , what exactly have the Zik-Zak Corporation said ? Their whole campaign is organized round the use of our blipverts to prevent channel switching . No blipverts - no deal . This contract is huge . We can 't just reject a Transglobal campaign . - We cannot withdraw blipverts now . - We can 't go on using them ! - They are lethal , goddam it ! - That is not proved . - That tape wasn 't proof . - What the hell do you need ? A live demonstration ? Ashwell , I find that tasteless . It is very clear that blipvert is a ... brilliant breakthrough . Half a million of advertising in 3 seconds - it 's magnificent ! It is . It 's also killing people . We buried that kind of crap decades ago . I am not prepared to risk my network over it . Ben , I am talking ratings ! - I 'm talking people . - Same thing . We must come clean on this . If you won 't , then I will . Well , there is a connection loose on the [ ... ] that I fixed . But we still have nothing from the other night . - Can you remember anything ? - No , not a thing except ... bits . Remember Bryce in the lab , and ... a barrier arm , and some ... weird noises , like voices . And here was Bryce and somebody ... And some creep standing over me with a scalpel in a Body Bank . - Body Banks are for dead people . - Yeah . And whoever was in the system the other night , certainly knew what they were doing . I nearly lost you . You gonna get the chance to lose me again tonight , ' cause I 'm going back to Bryce 's studio . Edison , are you fit enough ? Okay , I 'm going back into 23 , and you 'll need some clothes . With me just one piece . I won 't explain . Just stay tuned to Big-Time . More later ... M ... later . Yes , of course . I 'll prepare the contract immediately . Thank you so much . Goodbye . Hey ! Reg ! Come in quick ! - What 's up ? - We got a client ! Some TV repair . I think [ ... ] in here is perfect for them . - They love it ! - More later ... more later ... more later ... - Because [ ... ] too much . - More later ... more later ... more later ... - But that 's just the point . - More later ... more later ... more later ... - They want to use that . - - More later ... more later ... More later . More I ... mo ... Big-Time Television . Ratings 1000 . Ratings 1000 . - How am I supposed to ... ? - Stick together ? Stay put . Reg , this is incredible . Over a thousand viewers . You might get paid this month . What the hell is that ? His rating . - You kidding ? Well , why not ? Max Headroom , 2.3 million . Well , that 's what you wanted , ain 't it ? Max Headroom . He could have his own show . Big-Time , this is Max Headroom on Big-Time Television . And what I want to know is : Don 't Eskimos ever get bored with their weather forecast ? - It 's Max , Max , Max on Big-Time ! - Christ , this is amazing . How amazing . If you are watching me , who 's watching Network 23 ? A network with a great future behind it . As they say when you buying suppositories : with friends like those , who needs enemas ? Go for it , Max . You ... son of a bitch , go for it ! We 'll get a car phone fixed . Probably just a grilled microchip . - Mr. Bryce . - You were supposed to come back and report . I share no need to go on the videophone . Well , um ... my mom wasn 't feeling too good and we just [ ... ] to see it . You did exactly as I asked ? Oh , to the letter - one got rid of and the other locked away . Good . Locked away . I admire the clarity and precision of your response . Perhaps , therefore , you could clearly and precisely explain this : Big-Time Television . Do the Chinese really have 30 different ways of saying a simple little word ... - and is that why their population is so ... - Hm . Very like the other bloke . A film with him is it , Mr. Bryce ? It is very like that other bloke . But it is not a film . That , Mr. Mahler , is a complete person . And that machine is encoded mind of the deid Mr Carter . Soon I will be able to reconstruct anybody on the screen ... even you , Mr. Mahler . So accurately that even your own Mom would know it was you . Might care to call it The Phoenix Mr. Bryce ? My God ... you could have all your politicians in little boxes . It is very handy . Now , Mr. Breugel , where is Big-Time Television ? We could move up the " Polish-O " , pull in an extra episode , - and get the " Standby Show " online ... - and [ ... ] vacuum by midnight . Could re-run " The Rat Killers " , it went megabox last level . We could go porno earlier . What do the analysts say , Ben ? What actually did it ? Is only two percent . Two percent is 26 million consumers , Ben . Once they start switching channels - it 's war , you know that ! It happens all the time . We are used to it . But if we were still running blipverts instead of regular adverts , there wouldn 't be any channel switching . Blipverts have only been off the air for 10 hours and already the ratings are 3.7 % down , Ben , not 2 % you suggest . I 'm going to reinstate blipverts . And that 's final . More class . Reggie , I take all back . You are brilliant . And this Max can [ ... ] all the beer you want . I 'm starving . Now , I 'm gonna micro some ... Alphabettie spaghetti lettuce in tomato sauce . You want some ? You offend . This Max is a rare facility . His data store is huge , right ? So he can access a lot of info , right ? Create a command and away with the next [ ... ] But it [ ... ] data , you know - 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 and 32 . It jumps . And it 's not just information . It 's like ... intuition . Oh , Reggie ... daaarliiing ... it 's only just a bloody old voice box , with a load of bytes . Route it and off it goes . It 's just other people 's phrases it uses . And how come he 's got a sense of humor ? There 's something very bad here - those two goons having Max . No one there [ ... ] , doesn 't head up , though . It had zap on my figures . Max is making this station . What if the real owner wants him back ? Over my dead body . It might be . I 'm gonna put the wheels on our bus back on - just in case . Okay , Bryce . Let 's start with the other night . Give me a graphic . We 're holding . It 's okay , we 've steadied . 28 and 42 have taken [ ... ] . Get analysis on this . That was unpleasant . But how unpleasant this is going to be when the blipverts have their [ ... ] effect . Somebody , sometimes is going to make a connection . Hey , look at this . That climb is exponential ! Figures in my news standing to thousands . Let 's take a look anyway , They may have something worth chasing . Now I understand why people prefer watching television to the radio . They work out how boring it is - watching the radio . This is Max Headroom on Big-Time . I had to spend a little time recently with a parrot . It 's true . I won 't tell you why , but what amazes me is why anybody wanna spend any time at all , sitting at home , teaching a bird to talk . I mean , what 's wrong the rest of the family , huh ? And of course , they teach it something really interesting like : " Who 's that pretty boy ? " - What I want to know is [ ... ] rich man 's ... - Get . Me . Bryce ! And you left him ? Like this ? Now , Bryce . Where is it ? That parrot station ... I think Edison Carter might have it . Carter ? But you told me he was ... Who did this to you ? Carter . How do we find him ? - How , damn it ? - Breugel and Mahler . They know . But it is a significant distance . How much ? - Oh , I should think of ... - At speed there will be much fuel . Thank very much . ( sings ) " Destruction 's our delight . Delight our greatest sorrow . " ( sings ) " Seven little girls ... sitting in the back seat , everyone in love with Fred . " " I said , why don 't one of you come up and sit beside me ? " " This is what the little girl said : All together now , 1 , 2 , 3 ... " keep your mind on the driving , keep your hands on the wheel ... " " ... keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead . " Oh , look ! ( sings ) " We 're having fun , sitting in the back seat ... " " ... hugging and kissing with Fre-e-ed . " Okay , we are here . Close the doors , lads . Too old for the Body Bank . Don 't move . They are not going anywhere . Murray , you getting all this ? You realize what this means ? You want to drift me ? It will never happen , Carter . They won 't transmit it . - What do I do , Ben ? - Do what you have to , Murray . Okay . We interrupt this program for a special news flash . Details over now live and direct to Edison Carter . Mr. Grossman , Head of Network 23 . You gonna tell me exactly what I want to know about " blipverts " . The whole story . The world is watching , live , and now on Network 23 . Tell me , Sir . When did you first learn that blipverts ... caused people to spontaneously explode ? What lot of ... bollocks . Parrots are only one round above politicians , though . You always know when they 're lying - their lips move . subtitles © VV 2015

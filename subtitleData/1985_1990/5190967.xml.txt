 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . CARL : is that it ? lncrease the magnification . Wunderbar . CHARLES : Now watch this . This is today . And this was yesterday . There 's no chance of instrument or computational error ? I ran it five times. lt 's out there . Charles , you understand the need for absolute secrecy at this point ? Secrecy ? I 've spent every waking moment of the last three years on this project . On our payroll . The board is adamant . They do not want to go public yet . It 's too late . I 've already called a press conference . - First thing tomorrow morning . - l 'm sorry . - You 're going to have to cancel it . - That 's absurd ! Charles ... . A discovery of this kind ! Why shouldn 't we publicize it ? You 'll get the recognition you deserve . Just be patient . I 've heard that before . No . To hell with the board . I 'm not canceling . - l really must insist . - Carl , get out ! I won 't discuss this further . [ Door slams shut ] It 's no use , Carl. I 'm not canceling . Did you hear me ? CATHY : Someone emptied both dryers to do their wash ... and they just dumped everything here on the table . Pettus , 208 , that 's his M.O. I guess I had it on a little hot . Any smaller , it 'd fit a Ken doll . A what ? A Ken doll , you know ? Barbie 's boyfriend ? Dark hair , snappy dresser , kind of stiff . Never mind . You got some advantages , coming from another planet . Your head isn 't crammed with cultural trivia . I don 't know . Sometimes , I wish it was . It would make me feel more like I belonged . I don 't wear these anymore . Yeah . Are those swimming trunks ? No . They 're , you know ... . Right . Do you like that ? I saw it in a catalogue. I couldn 't resist . Very nice . I gotta get to work . What is that ? It 's for Matt . " August Peltier . Attorney at Law . Anchorage , Alaska . " Estate of Captain Jack Sikes . " Matthew must have inherited this . Morning , Al , George . I told the lawyers I didn 't want this . - This key came with it . - Swell . Matt , Jack Sikes . Was he your father ? You 've been reading my mail , George ? No . He was my uncle . Well , allow me to offer you my condolences . Save it . Hear we got assigned to a murder case out at Caltech . Matt , aren 't you going to open it ? Albert , don 't you have some wastebaskets to empty ? The victim had some Newcomer connections , right ? Professor Charles Tower . An astronomer . He was in the first group of non-military personnel to visit our quarantine camp . - What did he do in Alaska ? - l thought he was from Caltech . - No. I meant your uncle . - l don 't know . He ran a fishing boat or something . Now , who 'd want to kill him ? - Your uncle was murdered ? - Professor Tower . - Who 'd want to off him ? - Certainly not a Newcomer . He did more than anyone to try to find out where we came from . - Aren 't you even the least bit curious ? - No . Come on , let 's get out to Caltech before the M.E. leaves . You know , Matthew , it would only take a minute to open it . George . I hadn 't seen Uncle Jack in 20 years . I never missed him . I never thought about him . And I sure as hell don 't need whatever 's in that trunk . And I sure as hell don 't need whatever 's in that trunk . Tower spent most of his time with the orbiting telescope ... at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . I spoke with his assistant , a Dr. Myers . Tower was very secretive about his work . He felt he never received the recognition that he deserved . I know just how he felt . Hi , I 'm Sikes . This is my partner , Francisco . What 've we got ? Blunt force trauma to the top of the cranium. lt split the skull wide open . Pushing the bone into the frontal lobes of the brain . When did he die ? - Time of death ? - Between 10 : 00 and midnight . Where was he when it happened ? is there a problem here ? Where was he ? Standing directly in front of his desk . There 's blood splattered on top of it . Look ... if you 're some kind of Purist or something , that 's your business . But you better keep it at home , 'cause I don 't like it in my face . I am what I am . A human being who believes in maintaining the integrity of our planet . Why do you put up with that crap ? I didn 't see any point in making a scene . Two rights don 't make a wrong . - Two wrongs , George . - Exactly . Matt , look at the pattern made by the blood . MATT : Something 's missing . Something wide , flat and rectangular was removed from the desk after the murder ... taking Tower 's blood with it . A blotter ? A desk calendar ? - Maybe a star map . - A what ? Star map . It 's a computer-plotted map of the sky . Or at least a sector of it . Astronomers use them . How do you know about a star map ? What , do you think I 'm a complete moron ? Well , not complete , no . It 's just that you never ... seem to show much interest in the natural sciences . I know about star maps , George , okay ? Come on , let 's get over to JPL . Find Tower 's assistant . I want you to know how sorry I am about Dr. Tower . I wasn 't very close with him ... but still , he was a brilliant , brilliant scientist . Yes , he was . Marissa , I want you to know , the board thinks very highly of your work . - And so do I . - Thank you . CARL : We 're continuing your stipend . MATT : Excuse me . Are you Dr. Myers ? Professor Tower 's assistant ? Yes . You 're from the police ? Yeah , Detective Sikes , Detective Francisco . This is Dr. Peterson . He 's with the interplanetary interest Committee . - Excuse me. I 'm afraid I 've got to go . - Did you know Professor Tower ? My organization is a lobbying group for space research . I know just about everybody in the field . It 's a terrible loss . Excuse me . Please , come on in . I help a few of the senior professors with their research . In return , I 'm given time for my own projects . You see , I just got my doctorate . Normally someone in my position wouldn 't be given the time . That 's our space telescope . The shuttle put it in orbit back in 1991 . You see , it has a radio telescope that picks up frequencies ... from all over the universe . But it also has a powerful optical telescope . And being in space , its vision isn 't obscured by the Earth 's atmosphere . That 's how we get all these pictures . They 're beautiful . - Matt , do you see ? - Yeah , real nice . - A star map coming off the plotter . - That is what you mentioned . - What was Tower working on ? - l don 't know . I fed his coordinates into the telescope ... and set up the computer to receive the data . But he did the rest . Dr. Tower never let me look at his maps . is there any way we can find out what he was working on ? MYERS : I believe you 'll need a subpoena . MATT : We 'll get it . Plus a consultant to go over the data with you . No offense . That 's standard procedure . If you remember anything or just need to get in touch . - Let 's hit it , George . - Wait . Could I take a look ? It 's magnificent . MYERS : The telescope converts what it sees into a video signal . Then it beams it down here . Matt , you 've got to see this . I 've seen it . Look , George , we 're on the company clock . Just a little longer . We don 't really need to look at the stars for our research . The data is much more useful plotted on paper ... or manipulated as numbers in a computer . But astronomers have always gazed into the sky . I suppose it 's just something we need . - You didn 't even take a look . - l wasn 't interested . You live on a planet with the most primitive space travel . That telescope is your only access to the universe . And you are not even interested ? It 's just a bunch of stars , George . To me , it 's home . Somewhere out there is where l came from . Where I belong . One of those stars rises and sets on my planet . And your past is here , all around you . In the city , in the streets , and even that trunk by your desk . - Here we go with the trunk again . - How can you ignore it ? If I had a trunk from my family , a trunk connected to my past ... . Let me tell you about my past , George . I come from this long line of drunken ... wife-beating micks . My old man was the champ . The only one who was any different was my uncle Jack . He was a sailor . A real stargazing poet . I lived with him for a while. lt was great . Like you , George , he just loved to look up at the sky . Got me hooked in it , too . And then , one day , suddenly I 'm 13 years old ... and Jack ships off on a tanker . And that was it . Back to good old Dad . Okay ? Okay . Okay . GEORGE : Do you ever dream about home ? SUSAN : Home ? GEORGE : Tencton . Sometimes , when I close my eyes , I think I can see it . Three moons against a sea of stars . And blue , fields of blue . You were born on the ship . You never saw it . Well , somehow , I feel it 's in me . George , you 've only been under the lamp 10 minutes . You know how irritable you are when you don 't get enough UV . BUCK : Mom , where 's my sleeping bag ? - lt 's in the hall closet . - l looked . - Look again. lt 's there . - l don 't see it . I found it . If he does that to me one more time , I 'm going to peel his spots . I look up into the sky at night and I wonder how far away it is . What I would give to find out which star , just so I could say , " There ... " that is my home . " Mom , I cannot believe you packed this T-shirt . - What 's the matter with it ? - l can 't wear this at the slumber party . - lt 's completely childish . - So pick another one . They 're all like this . - Can I have one of yours , one of Buck 's ? - No , you can 't have one of Buck 's . Why don 't you go find one in my top drawer ? Thanks . And I want you to get some UV before you go . I feel fine . You 're going camping , you 'll need the energy . Okay . Okay . [ Susan sighs ] I hate to admit this , but I am so glad they 're going away for the weekend . If we don 't get some time alone , I don 't ... . George ? You 're in a strange mood . Oh , sorry . This case ... . Looking through that telescope ... . Don 't worry . This weekend will just be for me and you . I 'll open a tin of larvae . CARL : My God , they 've got his blood all over them . SERGlUS : We 've made some calculations . We 've got three days . We 'll need someone at JPL . - Marissa . She 'll send the transmission . - Good . - Then everything 's ready . - Take those away , would you ? You know , there 's a human expression you should remember : " You can 't make an omelet without breaking some eggs . " These maps will make you rich beyond your wildest dreams . - You will come , won 't you , Matt ? - What ? To my party tomorrow night . - Could we talk about it another time ? - Of course . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Look , I can get this myself . - No , it 's okay . No problem . - ls Jack Sikes your father ? - My uncle . Was my uncle . He died . - Oh , I 'm so sorry . - That 's okay. lt 's all right , it 's okay . Look , I can handle it myself . No problem. I can get it . I 'll just get this inside . - What 's in it ? - l don 't know . Aren 't you going to open it ? What is with you people ? Were you bred to be nosey ? I 'm sorry . I guess it 's none of my beeswax . - Just what does that mean ? - Look , it 's been a hell of a day . - Thanks for the help . - Sure . - You will come to my party , won 't you ? - Don 't count on me . We 'll see how tomorrow shapes up . All right . Sergeant , your uncle ... Captain Sikes , was he a pirate ? A pirate ? I 've been reading this very interesting book , Pirates of the South Seas . Did you know that they buried their treasures in trunks ? There is no treasure in my uncle 's trunk . - You opened it ? - No , I didn 't open it . Well , then , how do you know ? Matt , I 've made some calls . Tower 's research was entirely paid for ... by the interplanetary interest Committee . Now , we met with the director yesterday , Carl Peterson . It 's strange he neglected to tell us any of this . - That is strange . - Burns . What a surprise . What 's the matter ? Run out of two-headed baby stories ? Detective Francisco , any idea what Tower was working on ? Just ignore him , George . He 'll crawl back under his rock . I suppose the poignant irony of this escapes you ? A frustrated scientist brutally murdered on the eve of his greatest triumph . What are you talking about ? You guys don 't know , do you ? - Well , well , well . - Spit it out , Burns . No , you tell me what you know , I 'll tell you what I know . - A civilized exchange of information . - l got your civilized exchange . We just subpoenaed Tower 's computer files . - We might have something this afternoon . - Thank you , Francisco . You are a gentleman . Tower called a press conference just before he got bumped . Let 's go pay Carl Peterson a visit . Hey , Sikes , what 's this I hear about a trunk ? CARL : I didn 't know I had any information you would need . Professor Tower 's death is a great loss to us . - He helped our cause tremendously . - What cause is that ? Interplanetary research . Reaching out to extraterrestrial civilizations . Do you know what Tower was working on before he was killed ? Not specifically . No . GEORGE : But you paid for his research . A little thing you forgot to mention yesterday . We funded Tower on the basis of his reputation , not a specific proposal . Do you know that Tower had called a press conference before he died ? I have a very good idea . Let 's bring my lawyer into this . Your lawyer ? We 're not charging you with anything . This is for your protection , gentlemen . To make sure everything is done according to procedure . I wouldn 't want any evidence ruled inadmissible . You 're saying you won 't talk to us unless you have a lawyer ? No . Yes . Five , Paul , Charlie , Echo , three , seven , four . Registered to Carl Peterson . No wants , no priors . He 's clean . That yo-yo 's hiding something . I 'm going to order a 24-hour surveillance . Matt , looks like we have the first shift . MATT : Let 's see where old Carl leads us . GEORGE : Do you know this club ? MATT : Let 's just see who Carl 's meeting here . Excuse me , I 'm meeting with Professor Peterson . Has he come in yet ? I believe the Professor 's upstairs in the smoking room . Good . Come , George . Carl 's already upstairs . - Just a moment , please . - Come along , dear . - Are you friends of the Professor ? - Old friends , dear friends . I think I better call up and tell him you 're here . is there a problem ? I 'm sorry , gentlemen , but we have a dress code . Of course , I understand . How tacky . I 'll wait outside , George . I 'm afraid not . You must understand , this is a private club . - Matt , let 's go . - You mean this is a restricted club . - No Newcomers . - Matt . No , no , no , no , no. I understand . I couldn 't agree more . Who knows what kind of diseases these Slags carry , huh ? The things they eat . I hope you don 't let any wops in either . Any spics , any hebes . Keep up the good work . That coroner , this guy . - You let these jerks walk all over you . - lt 's not important . Do you realize , the head of a space advocacy group ... belongs to a Newcomer-restricted club ? You just stood there . There is no sense in getting upset with stupid people . It is a waste of energy and you just reduce yourself to their level . Yeah , I 'll remember that next time you jump down my throat ... for telling a spongehead joke . I am harder on you , not because you are particularly smart ... but because I am forced to associate with you on a daily basis . Thanks . Matt . You are better than they are ... you 're worth it . Hey , just a sec . Hello , this is Cathy Frankel . I 'm unable to take your call . Please leave a message at the sound of the beep . [ Answering machine beeps ] Hi , Cathy . Sikes . I really hate these things . Look ... I 'll come to your party tonight , okay ? MYERS : These are copies of Tower 's star maps . Duplicates of the ones we suspect are missing . I couldn 't believe it when I saw it . There it is . The object discovered by Professor Tower . An intelligent radio source on the edge of our solar system ... headed back into deep space . - Maybe an unmanned probe . - Whose unmanned probe ? It 's certainly not one of ours . It 's not from this planet . We cross-referenced every comet , satellite , meteor . We know the trajectory your ship must have taken before it crashed . We matched it with this object . We believe it 's coming from the same direction ... that your people were headed . What 's it doing ? Where 's it going ? MYERS : It just went behind the sun . It 'll re-emerge mid-morning , two days from now ... but it will be much further away . It 'll only be in range for a couple of hours before we lose it again for good . We 'll be tracking it , with the rest of the world , trying to make contact . I 'm going to notify everyone , all the major observatories- - Wait . I don 't think you should do that . - Why ? - You are a scientist. I understand . But consider the consequences if it came from the same planet ... that enslaved my people . They lost valuable property . 250,000 slaves . What if they are looking for that property ? What if that thing was sent out to find us ? We don 't know that . It might not have anything to do with you . But doesn 't it make sense ? The exact same trajectory as our ship ? - We can 't afford to take that chance . - There 's something else . This thing , whatever it is , is probably what got Tower killed . - Matt . - Cathy . I 'm so glad you came . - Me , too . - l really want you to feel at home . Come and meet some of my guests . Jerry ? Cathy ! [ ln Tenctonese ] Well , what do you think ? - l like it . - Really ? Do you really ? Yes , yes , I like it . Jerry , I 'd like you to meet my neighbor . This is Matt . How you doing ? This is my friend , John . John 's a composer . This is one of his pieces. lsn 't he brilliant ? - Bowod . - He calls me Bowod . It 's a Newcomer name. lt means " valiant . " I love the sound . Bowod . Don 't you adore these people ? They came with nothing . Nothing ! They can appreciate a sunset , a flower . And they are unbelievably sensual . There 's Bill Shakespeare . Excuse me . Lucky girl . Jerry designs soap . - And what do you do , Matt ? - l 'm a cop . Oh . Nice talking to you , too . Matt , you have to understand , some Newcomers resent the police . And with good reason . You know what happened to Tony 's brother ? The guy 's a brilliant nephrologist , right ? He was making a house call in Bel Air . These two cops pull him over . Want to know how come ... a Slag is driving a Porsche . He tells them they have no right to question him . Well , fascist Terts beat him with their flashlights and arrested him . " Fascist Terts " ? Matt , why don 't we get you something to eat ? No , no , no , no , no. I 'd like to hear more about these " fascist Terts . " Just because a Tenctonese has a nice car ... . Let me take this opportunity , as a fascist Tert ... to apologize on behalf of the entire Los Angeles Police Department . Matt ... . l also want to tell you about a couple friends of mine . Hey , listen , man , it 's no biggie ... . They stopped a BMW once for a minor traffic violation . Do you know what happened to them ? The Newcomer inside took out a shotgun and blew their faces off ! Thank you for making this a truly unforgettable evening . You didn 't sleep very well . Your thorax was grumbling all night . Sorry . George ? Looking through that telescope , it was so beautiful . I forgot what else was out there . What if the Overseers find us ? Well , then we 'll fight them . And we 'll have everyone on Earth fighting with us . Are you so sure ? I have to believe it , George . This world is our home now . - You know , I 've been thinking ... . - What ? Maybe we should have another child . A child born here . A child of this Earth . Are you sure you want to bring a child up in this world ? Our future , our people 's future , is here , George . Susan , do you realize what this would mean ? - An infant . All that work . - l know . And two days ago I couldn 't wait to get Emily and Buck out of the house ... - and now I want another baby . - You 're just starting a job . George , I only have three more cycles left . We won 't have another chance after that . - l don 't know . Maybe it 's a crazy idea . - No . The kids . They are growing up so fast . They 'll be gone before we know it . Maybe I 've forgotten what it was like , you know ? We 've both gotten used to our freedom . All those sleepless nights . Don 't forget the incubation time you 'll have to put in with the pod . It could be easier this time . We have a house . It could be good for the whole family . Celine , what a decision . We don 't have to decide today . kim : Those big yellow things are Newcomer skin cells . All the white stuff ? Bone tissue from Professor Tower 's skull . - Which means ? - Which means ... Tower was killed by a punch from a Newcomer 's fist . It broke through the cranium , pushed the bone into the brain ... but it left those cells behind . A Newcomer killed Tower ? He devoted his work to tracing our origins . Perhaps you 'd like to have a look , Sergeant . I trust your analysis . Newcomers are considerably stronger than humans . More adaptable . Now , in Darwinian terms , what does that mean to our species ? It means we 'd better stay on their good side . Seeing that Peterson belonged to a restricted club ... I did a little checking up . It seems he 's a card-carrying Purist . So is everybody on his board . So , the so-called space research group is really dedicated to getting rid of us . Looks that way . Good . I subpoenaed some records from the phone company . Every call made from the interplanetary interest Committee ... in the last three months . - Man , this is going to take some time . - Maybe not . You 're putting me on . You can 't read that fast . Look . A call made to Tower 's office just 30 minutes before he was killed . Unreal ! Carl Peterson is human . He couldn 't have killed Tower . I bet he knows who did . Peterson 's pretty squirrelly . Let 's give him a squeeze . - What are you ... . - George , don 't ! Don 't ! Purist scum ! - George , you 're already on probation ! - l don 't care ! George ! Somebody called Tower from this office 30 minutes before he was killed . - That somebody was you ! - You can 't do this . - Get him away from me ! - George , there 's already one guy ... in a wheelchair because of you . It 's not right ! [ George grunts ] - First , I will break your leg . - lt wasn 't me ! - And then , I will eat your face . - lt wasn 't me ! - Please ! - George , wait . You saying somebody else made the phone call ? Yes ! No ! I made the call , but I didn 't kill him . Then who did ? Mein Gott ! Thirty minutes . That is plenty of time to make sure that he is in his office ... and then drive over and kill him ! George , don 't hurt him ! I called to see how he was doing . We were friends. I called him all the time . Check with the phone company . You talked with Tower all the time , and yet you don 't know ... what he was working on ? - Let me at him ! - George ! [ George snarling ] - Please . George , you 're hurting me . - Oh , sorry . Look , Carl , you 're the closest thing to a murder suspect we 've got right now . I happen to think you 're innocent . I think you 're working with some Overseers who killed Tower . Trouble is , my partner doesn 't think that way . Please help me out . Tell me who it was . I can 't control him . Please . Call me , huh ? Please . Come on , get out ! " Then I will eat your face " ? Where do you come up with that stuff ? - l thought that sounded quite menacing . - Menacing , right . I just hope we don 't get the bill for that desk . Desk ? Do you think I 'd have to pay for that ? Matt , I barely tapped it . We didn 't achieve our objective , though , did we ? I don 't know . Carl 's cracking. I think he just needs another night to sweat it out . [ Knocking on door ] [ Knocking on door ] - Hello . - Hi . I 'd like to talk to you . - Maybe this isn 't a good time . - No , no , no. lt 's okay . Come on in . - l 'd like to apologize for last night . - No , I was the one out of control . Runs in the family . No . You were right to be angry . I should have never had this party . I don 't even like those people . I guess I was just trying to fit in . It was very stupid . The worst thing ... . - l used you . - Me ? Oh , yeah . I did kind of feel on display . " Cathy 's human date . " I 'm sorry . - ls that you ? - Yeah . My uncle had some old photos . I haven 't seen them in years . - May I ? - Sure . I love looking at old family pictures . - Where were these taken ? - Detroit , mostly . That 's where l grew up . Also in L.A. You are so lucky to have these . Yeah . - Uncle Jack . - ls that your uncle Jack ? He was in the merchant marines . Look . He used to let me wear his peacoat . I loved that coat more than anything in the world . You were very close with him . Here , look at this . - He left that to you ? - Yep . Hell , this is ridiculous . After all these years , you know ? I lived with my uncle Jack , off and on ... whenever my old man got out of line . But old Jack was a sailor . And one day he took off . I never forgave him for leaving me behind . I never called . Never answered any of his letters . What a dumb kid , huh ? [ Sighs ] I just wish I could 've said goodbye . Can I show you something ? On the slave ship , we were with our parents until we were 10 . And then we were taken away from them . Sometimes to another workstation . Sometimes to another planet . We never saw them again . A quarter of a million of us on that ship ... and somehow , the rumors still filtered back . About a family member who 'd been shipped to a mining colony ... or to another workstation . Another ship . Or someone who 'd died ... or been killed by the Overseers . We never really knew for sure . - See that constellation ? - Orion ? That 's my father . Standing watch , protecting me when I was too exhausted to move . And that one . Cassiopeia . The Queen . My mother . With a dignity that no one could take away from her . The Swan. I forget what it 's called . That 's me . When I was still a girl . Before I was taken away from the people I loved . These are my old photographs . [ Telephone rings ] - Detective Sikes . - This is Carl Peterson . Yeah ? You 're early . We 've got a big day ahead of us . Who were you calling ? Nobody . A friend. lt can wait . Our message . Have you spoken to the woman at JPL ? Does she know that we 're coming ? Marissa ? No . I thought it best if we just showed up . - Then let 's go. ls everything ready ? - What 's it say ? What we agreed on in the beginning : " We survive . Our cargo of 250,000 awaits your arrival . " No , no , there 's more here . I can read some of this . It says- - I told you what it says . MATT : I had a feeling he was in trouble . He 's dead . - lt 's a photocopy . - Can you read it ? It 's a Tenctonese binary code . What the Overseers used on our ship . - Like a Morse code ? - Yes . We used something like it to tap messages to each other . [ Speaking Tenctonese ] " We survive . " Our cargo of 250,000 awaits your arrival . " Plus an additional four billion more . " It 's followed by a set of celestial coordinates . Coordinates ? Earth 's coordinates . Matt , it 's what I thought . That probe . They are trying to contact that probe . Four billion more slaves ... . The entire planet ? That space telescope , George . It also has a transmitter . Dr. Myers ? I 'm Dr. Sergius Fromme . I 'm on the board of the l.l.C. Professor Peterson sent me . - He sent you ? - He couldn 't come himself . - This is the message he 'd like transmitted . - l don 't understand . Of course . Professor Peterson didn 't tell you . We 'd like you to make contact with the probe when it clears the sun ... and send this message . I 'm not authorized to transmit . I 'll have to confirm this with him . There really isn 't time . is it locked on to the probe 's coordinates ? is it locked on to the probe 's coordinates ? - Yes . - Access the transmitter . Continue . When this reaches zero , the probe has cleared the sun. ls that correct ? We 'll send my message as soon as it does . Police ! Don 't move ! Sikes , get his other heart ! [ Gunshots ] GEORGE : Ms. Myers , come here . You transmitted the message ? MYERS : You forced him to send it four seconds early . The probe wouldn 't have quite cleared the sun . Most likely , the message was lost . - " Most likely " ? - Most likely . - Are you still thinking about that case ? - No . Something else . About you and me . And our new child . Our new child . I may dream of our planet , but you 're right . This is our home now . This strange , yet wonderful Earth . A child will bond us to it . Yes . [ ln Tenctonese ] - Keep your eyes closed . - Okay . - Okay . - You 're almost there . Now ... it isn 't as good as being there , but maybe it 'll do for now . Open your eyes . It 's for you . It was my uncle 's . - Matt , I ... . - Listen , I knew the guy pretty good . If he was around , he 'd give it to you himself . Thank you . I remember when I was a kid , looking up at the sky with him . Feeling so small . There are so many stars , Cathy . So many suns with so many planets . Yes . I often ask myself : " Why is it ? " How is it that we ended up here ? " We all ask ourselves that . But you were born here . This is your home . You know , my uncle spent his whole life traveling . When you 'd ask where he called home , he 'd point right here . Why don 't you take a closer look at your family photos ?

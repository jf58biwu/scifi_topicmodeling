 - You 're looking good , Dutch . - It 's been a long time , general . Come on inside . 18 hours ago , we lost a chopper carrying a cabinet minister and his aide from this charming little country . We 've got a transponder fixed on their position ... about here . This cabinet minister , does he always travel on the wrong side of the border ? Apparently , they strayed off course . We 're fairly certain they 're in guerrilla hands . So why don 't you use the regular army ? What do you need us for ? 'Cos some damn fool accused you of being the best . Dillon ! You son of a bitch ! What 's the matter ? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils ? - Had enough ? - Make it easy on yourself , Dutch . OK ! OK ! OK ! - Never did know when to quit . - Damn good to see you , Dutch . - What is this fucking tie business ? - Come on . Forget about my tie , man . I heard about that little job you pulled off in Berlin . - Very nice , Dutch . - Good old days . Like the good old days . Then how come you passed on Libya ? - That wasn 't my style . - You got no style . You know that . Come on . Why 'd you pass ? We 're a rescue team , not assassins . Now , what we gotta do ? That cabinet minister is very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . Dutch , the general is saying that a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed and we can 't let that happen . We need the best . That 's why you 're here . - Go on . - Simple setup . One-day operation . We pick up their trail at the chopper , run them down , grab those hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there . - What do you mean ' we ' ? - I 'm goin ' in with you , Dutch . General , my team always works alone . You know that . I 'm afraid we all have our orders , major . Once you reach your objective Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge . ♪ Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John ♪ ♪ He claims he has the misery ♪ ♪ but he has a lot of fun ♪ ♪ Oh , baby ♪ ♪ Yeah , baby ♪ ♪ Havin ' me some fun tonight , yeah ♪ ♪ Well , long tall Sally , ♪ ♪ she 's built for speed ♪ Yeah , OK . ♪ Oh , baby ♪ ♪ Yeah , baby ♪ ♪ Whoa , baby ♪ ♪ Havin ' me some fun tonight , yeah ♪ ♪ Well , I saw Uncle John ♪ ♪ with bald headed Sally ♪ ♪ He saw Aunt Mary comin ' ♪ ♪ and he ducked back in the alley ♪ ♪ Oh , baby ♪ ♪ Yeah , baby ♪ ♪ Whoa , baby ♪ ♪ Havin ' me some fun tonight , yeah ow ! ♪ Delta One-Zero to Two Leader .

Never knew how much I missed this , Dutch . You never were that smart . Hawkins , you 're up . Lines away . The pilots have been shot one round in the head . Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it . - Took ' em out with a heat seeker . - There 's something else , major . This is no ordinary army taxi . It looks more like a surveillance bird to me . - Pick up the trail yet ? - Billy 's on it . Heat seeker , Dillon . That 's pretty sophisticated for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys . Major . I guess they 're getting better equipped every day . There were 12 guerrillas . They took the two men from the helicopter , but there 's something else . - What do you mean ? - Six men wearing US-issued army boots . They came in from the north , and then they followed the guerrillas . Mean anything to you ? Probably just another rebel patrol . They operate in here all the time . - Get ahead and see what you can find . - Yes , sir . - What 's he got ? - Same business . Guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper followed by men with American equipment . - Do you remember Afghanistan ? - Trying to forget it . Come on , let 's go . Holy Mother of God . Jim Hopper . Mac , cut ' em down . I knew these men . Green Berets out of Fort Bragg . What the hell were they doing here ? I don 't know , Dutch . This is inhuman . Nobody told me there was an operation in this area . - They shouldn 't have been here . - Well , somebody sent them . The guerrillas skinned them ? Why did they skin them ? Ain 't no way for no soldier to die . - What happened here , Billy ? - Strange , major . There was a firefight . They were shooting in all directions . I can 't believe that Jim Hopper walked into an ambush . I don 't believe he did . I can 't find a single track . - It just doesn 't make sense . - What about the rest of Hopper 's men ? There 's no sign , sir . They never left here . Hell , it 's like they just disappeared . Stick with the guerrilla trail . Let 's get the hostages . We move . Five-metre spread . No sound . It 's time to let old painless out the bag . Payback time . You 're ghosting ' us , motherfucker . I don 't care who you are back in the world . You give our position up one more time I 'll bleed you , real quiet , and leave you here . Got that ? Fuck you . He killed one of the hostages . We move . Mac , Blain the nest . Billy , Poncho the guard . Hawkins , Dillon backup . As soon as they 're set , I hit the fuel dump . One down . What the hell 's he doin ' ? What the fuck ... Showtime , kid . Target 's the centre of the palapa ! Dutch , on your nine ! Get that motherfk ! Go ! Stick around . Hostages are inside ! Knock , knock . I got ' em ! Hawkins , call in position and situation . Get Con Op on the hook ! You got it , major . Shit . Mac ! - Yo ! - Any sign of the other hostage ? Found the other guy he 's dead , too . And the gear from the chopper . But if they 're Central American , I 'm a goddamn Chinaman . From the looks of it , our cabinet minister was CIA . Another thing , major . They were lucky . The other guys they waxed were Russian military advisers . Something pretty big was gonna happen here . Good work , Mac . Clear the area . No traces . - Get the men ready to move . - All right . Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick . - You 're hit . You 're bleedin ' , man . - I ain 't got time to bleed . OK . You got time to duck ? This is goddamn beautiful . Goddamn jackpot . This is more than we ever thought we 'd get . We finally got those bastards . - We got ' em . - I think this is what you 're looking for . You set us up ! It 's all bullshit . All of it . The cabinet minister , the whole business . Got us in here to do your dirty work . Look . We just stopped a major invasion . In three days they 'd have crossed the border with this stuff . Why us ? Because nobody else could 've pulled it off . You 're pissed about the cover story . I knew I couldn 't get you in here without it . So , what story did you hand to Hopper ? Look . We 've been looking for this place for months . My men were in that chopper when it got hit ! Hopper 's orders were to go in and get me men and he disappeared . He didn 't disappear . He was skinned alive ! And my orders were to get somebody who could crack these bastards ! So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder . What happened to you , Dillon ? You used to be somebody I could trust . I woke up . Why don 't you ? You 're an asset , an expendable asset . And I used you to get the job done . Got it ? My men are not expendable . And I don 't do this kind of work . Major , we stepped into some real shit here ! Te sientes bien ? Air surveillance says we 've got guerrillas all over the place . Can 't be more than one , two miles away . - This place 's coming down . - How much time ? Half an hour , maybe less . - Tell Mac we move in five . - Yes , sir . Wait , she goes with us . She 's too valuable . She 's got another whole network . She 'll give away our position any chance she gets . No deal . You 're still under orders , major . Now , you wanna make that call or should I ? She 's your baggage . You fall behind and you 're on your own . This place is too hot for a pickup . They won 't touch us till we get over the border . Hey , Billy . Give me a way out of this hole . Aerial says we are cut off . The only way outta here is that valley that leads to the east . I wouldn 't waste that on a broke-dick dog . Not much choice . Poncho , take lead . Double-time it . Dillon ! Dillon ! Over here . - Turn around . - Why ? Thanks . Any time . Billy ! Billy ! The other day I was goin ' down on my girlfriend . I said to her " Jeez , you 've got a big pussy . " " Jeez , you 've got a big pussy . " She said " Why did you say that twice ? " I said " I didn 't . " See , it was because of the echo . Over here . Over here . Over here . Turn around . Turn around . Turn around . Turn around . Over here . Any time . Any time . Goddamn ! Buddy , buddy , buddy , buddy ! I 've seen some bad-ass bush before , man , but nothin ' like this . I hear you . This shit 's somethin ' . Makes Cambodia look like Kansas . Hey , qué pasa , amigo ? Little taste of home . You lose it here , you 're in a world of hurt . Come on , sweetheart . Stop sandbagging ' it . Now , get up . Come on , get up . Would you get up ? Mierda ! Ni lo intentes . Maybe you 'd better put her on a leash , agent man . Try it again ... please . Callate ! What 's got Billy so spooked ? Can 't say , major . Been acting squirrelly all morning . That damn nose of his ... It 's weird . What is it ? Billy ... What the hell is wrong with you ? There 's something in those trees . Do you see anything ? Up there . Nothing . What do you think ? I guess it 's nothing , major . Please ! Please ! Billy , break left . Mac , right . What the ... - This isn 't her blood . - What the hell 'd you do to him ? Major ... you 'd better take a look at this . Did you find Hawkins ? I can 't tell . What in God 's name ... I think it 's Hawkins . - Where the hell is his body ? - There 's no sign of it . Ask her what happened . What happened ? What happened here ? Qué fue lo que viste ? - Quién fue ? - Yo no sé . - La selva se lo llevé . - Qué ? No estoy segura . No sé . She says the jungle ... It just came alive and took him . Bullshit ! That 's not what she said ! What she said doesn 't make any sense . Look . Those sappers have followed us ever since ... They 'd been in front of us , man ! This woman is just ranting on ... Hold it ! Hold it ! Why didn 't they take his radio or his weapon ? Why didn 't she escape ? - Hopper . - What ? They did the same thing to Jim Hopper . I want Hawkins ' body found . Sweep pattern . Double back . 50 metres . Let 's go . Come on in , you fuckers . Come on in . Old painless is waitin ' . Contact ! Motherfucker ! - What happened ? - I saw it . - You saw what ? - I saw it . Blain ... No powder burns , no shrapnel . The wound 's all fused , cauterised . What the hell could have done this to a man ? Mac ... Mac , look at me ! Who did this ? I don 't know , goddamn it . I saw something . Not a thing . Not a fuckin ' trace . No blood , no bodies . We hit nothing . Dillon , better get on the radio . Mac ... - Sergeant ! - Yes , sir . I want a defensive position above that ridge mined with everything we 've got . Put him in his poncho . Take him with us . I got him . Vémonos . Major , I set up flares , frags and claymores . Nothing 's coming near this place without tripping on somethin ' . Thank you , sergeant . Mac ... He was a good soldier . He was ... my friend . Goodbye , bro . Blazer One , I repeat , extraction necessary . Say again , Blazer One . Say again . Request for extraction denied . Area is still compromised . Proceed to sector 3.000 for prisoner extraction . Priority , out . Next contact 09 : 30 . Roger , Blazer One . 10 : 30 hours . Damn bastards . They say we 're still in too far . And they can 't risk coming in after us . We 're assets , Dillon . Expendable assets . It comes with the job . I can accept it . Bullshit . You 're just like the rest of us . A shitload of good a chopper 's gonna do us in here anyhow . Sergeant ? Sergeant ! Sergeant ! Who hit us today ? I don 't know . I only saw one of them camouflaged . He was there . Those eyes disappeared . What was that ? Those eyes , they ... They disappeared . I know one thing , major . I drew and fired straight at it . Capped off 200 rounds in the Minigun ... Full pack . Nothing ... nothing on this earth could have lived . Not at that range . Mac , you take first watch , then you get some rest . Ask her . Ask her what she saw . Ask her what happened to Hawkins . Go ahead . Ask her . Qué pasé hoy ? Qué fue lo que viste ? Te dije lo que sé . Fue la selva la que se lo Ilevé . Qué més quieres que te diga ? She says the same fuckin ' thing . The jungle , it came alive and took him . Billy ... you know something . What is it ? - I 'm scared , Poncho . - Bullshit . You ain 't afraid of no man . There 's something out there waiting for us ... and it ain 't no man . We 're all gonna die . The guy 's losing it . He 's losing his cool . There 's nothing but a couple of guys running around out there . We got to take them down . You still don 't understand , Dillon , do you ? Whatever it is out there , it killed Hopper , and now it wants us . Here we are again , bro , just you and me . Same kind of moon and same kind of jungle . Real number 10 night , remember ? Whole platoon , 32 men chopped into meat , and we walk out , just you and me . Nobody else . Right on top , bro . Not a scratch . Not a fuckin ' scratch . You know , whoever got you , he 'll come back again and when he does , I 'm gonna cut your name right into him . I 'm gonna cut your name into him . - What the hell is it ? - Mac ! - This way ! Over here ! - Mac , where are you ? Mac ! Mac ! Fuck you ! Mac , where are you ' ? - Don 't fuck with me . - Mac ? Mac ! Where are you ? - Jesus . - I got you , motherfucker . I killed you , you fuck . - Jesus ! You killed a pig . - What the ... Do you think you could have found something bigger ? Fuck you , Poncho . Fuck you ! - Where 's the girl ? - Shit ! Why the hell wasn 't anybody watching her ? Why didn 't she try to get away ? Look at her . She 's scared out of her mind . Major , you better take a look at this . Blain 's body , it 's gone . It came in through the tripwires . Took it right out from under our noses . That boar had to set off the trip flare , Major , cos there ain 't no other tracks . How could anyone get through this and carry out Blain without us knowing it ? And why didn 't he try and kill one of us ? He came in to get the body . - He 's killing us one at a time . - Like a hunter . He 's using the trees . Yesterday , what did you see ? - You 're wasting your time . - No more games . I don 't know what it was . - It ... - Go on . It changed colours like the chameleon . It uses the jungle . Are you sayin ' that Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fuckin ' lizard ? That 's a bullshit psych job . There 's two or three men out there at the most . Fucking lizard ! - What 's your name ? - Anna . Anna , this thing is hunting us . All of us . You know that . - What the hell do you think you are doing ? - Dillon , We need everyone . I 'm taking her back . We 're out of here in 5 minutes . We 're not going yet . Look . The rendezvous is 10 to 12 miles away from here . You think the chopper 's going to wait ? Dillon , we make a stand now or there will be nobody left to go to the chopper . There is something else . When the big man was killed , you must have wounded it . Its blood was on the leaves . If it bleeds , we can kill it . Look out . You really think this boy-scout bullshit is gonna work . It can see our tripwires . Maybe it can 't see this . Instead of complaining , maybe you should help . What makes you think he 's gonna come in through here ? There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards . This is the only way in . When I was little , we found a man . He looked like ... like , butchered . The old women in the village crossed themselves and whispered crazy things , said strange things " El diablo , cazador de hombres . " Only in the hottest years this happens . And this year it grows hot . We begin finding our men . We found them sometimes without their skin and sometimes much , much worse . " El que hace trofeos de los hombres " means : " The demon who makes trophies of man . " So , what are you gonna try next ? Cheese ? Hey , Dutch . Dutch ! Holy shit ! Look out ! Got you , motherfucker ! I got you ! I 'm coming ! Mac ! Mac ! Get Ramirez on his feet and get to the chopper . Right . Hold it , Dutch . I 'm going after Mac . That 's not your style , Dillon . Guess I picked up some bad habits from you . Now get your people the hell outta here . You can 't win this , Dillon . Maybe I can get even . Dillon . Just hold on to that damn chopper . He 's busted up pretty bad , major . I can make it . I can make it . - Get the radio . Forget the rest . - Right .

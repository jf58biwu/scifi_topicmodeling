 Hut ! Touchdown ! Paul Taylor . 17-yard pass from Terry Stokes . Paul , look at her , man . Look at her ! I think she wants your body . You got to ask her out , Paul . Isn 't she dating Pulver ? Yeah , but that 's going nowhere . Take a shot , for Christ 's sake . Hey , I 'm going to ask her out . Bullshit ! When , when , when ? - When the time is right . - Yeah , right . Timing 's everything . Hit him ! Hit him ! Yeah ! All right ! Wildcat fumble . Husky ball . First and ten . 7-yard pass complete to Paul Taylor . Meg , you have any plans this evening ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Looks like the game put you out of business . Don 't worry . When they 're through screaming they 'll be in here like a flood . More iced tea ? Please . It 's good that this town 's got up on its hindlegs about something . It takes people 's minds off their troubles . It 's been a lean year for most folk . The ski season is about to start . There will be tourists . You know , there 's a new band out at the Tin Palace tonight . Is that right ? Supposed to be pretty good . That 's nice . You like country music ? Herb , are you asking me out ? Yeah , well , I guess I am . I don 't know . I 'm kind of stuck here . You know , I 've got to earn a living . Yeah , it must be tough trying to get away . Shoot ! George , here they come . Is that my check ? If you do get any free time to yourself that 's my number there down at the station . Okay . Okay . One at a time . Flagg . Congratulations . For what ? I hear you have a birthday coming up . No more juvie hall , right ? Yeah , right . You mess up now and you 're in the majors . I 'll see you around , Flagg . Moss , what 's happening ? You look like hell . It 's a fashion statement , man . The only statement those clothes have got to make is , " I look like hell . " My bike 's broken down at Elkin 's Grove . I was thinking maybe I could borrow your ratchet set ? The Summit 's got me overhauling six damn Skidoos , three Cats and two flatbed snowmakers , by Monday . What 's the hurry ? It must be 70 degrees out there . It 's Indian summer , boy . Very soon winter will be tear-arseing through this town with no apologies . Come on . It barely pissed snow the last couple of years . This whole town 's ready to fold . This year 's going to be different . Is that right ? Take my word . You 'll wish your piece of shit excuse for a motorcycle was one of these sweet little rigs . So how about the ratchet ? All right . Maybe I 'll put in a couple of hours over the weekend . Maybe that 'll lighten things up a bit . There are twelve sockets in that set . Twelve . They better all be there when I get it back . You got it , buddy . You got it . Thanks a lot , Moss . I owe you one . You owe me too damn many . Holy cow ! Lend me $ 5 just until tomorrow , okay ? What for ? You know , you 're not the only one with a date tonight . I 'm going to score with Vicki tonight . I want to invest in some protection . Let 's go . It 's closing time . All right , here . Make it quick . Look , pal . Give me a pack of Trojans , and a Binaca spray . Scott Jeskey . Reverend . Good game today . Thanks . Thanks , Reverend . How are you ? The hay fever 's acting up a little bit , but I 'll live . Haven 't seen you at the Sunday services lately . You want the ribbed , or the regular ? Ribbed , I guess . They 're not for me , you know . They 're for my friend . There 's this sort of naive girl that he 's planning on ... Well , you know . I insisted that he take precautions . Why doesn 't he pay for them ? I had to drag him down here as it is . The guy is totally irresponsible . Come on , Scott . What 's the hold up ? I can 't keep this girl waiting . The boy doesn 't need condoms . He needs a muzzle . Kevin ! Don 't eat with your face . Mum , we 're in a hurry . We 're going bowling with Anthony . And then to the movies . What movie ? Garden Tool Massacre . It 's your basic slice-and-dice . Your basic what ? This guy in a hockey mask , he chops up a few teenagers . But don 't worry , there 's no sex or anything bad . They won 't let you kids into a movie like that . No problem . My brother 's an usher . No . Absolutely not . Mum , come on ! Kevin ! I will not have you seeing that kind of trash , and that 's final . Do you understand ? Yes , ma 'am . Mum , have you seen my pink sweater ? It 's on the hamper , honey . I meant to talk to you about that . - Why did you do that ? - What did I do ? We had a little accident . What happened ? It got mixed up in the wash . Interesting look . Why don 't you wear my cashmere sweater ? - Are you serious ? - Sure . Oh , my God ! That 's him . What do you want ? Hi . I 'm here to see Meg . What for ? Just to see her . - ls she home ? - Just a minute . I 'm terribly sorry . You must be Paul . I 'm Meg 's mother . Nice to meet you , ma 'am . Come on in . Meg will be right down . Where are you going ? - I 'm sleeping over at Eddie 's , remember ? - Right . But you 're not going anywhere without your jacket . Mum , it 's boiling out . It 's October . It 's night-time . You 're wearing your jacket . - Stupid coat . - No , here , let me . Bye , honey . Enjoy yourself . Bye , Mum . Bye , Eddie . Oh , yeah . Won 't you sit down ? Excuse me . Hi , Paul . Are you surviving my family so far ? - Yeah . You look great . - Thank you . You want to go ? I just want you to meet my dad . It 'll just take a second . Sure . Daddy , I 'd like you to meet my friend , Paul . Ribbed . Hey ! I 'm really sorry about my dad . I 've never seen him like that before . That 's okay . It was just a misunderstanding . I 've made better first impressions . That 's for sure . No harm done , I guess . No , wrong . Scott Jeskey is going to die . Paul , watch out ! Flagg ! Jesus Christ . What did you do to him ? I 'm not the one who bounced him off my car , pal ! - You ran him into the road ! - Stop it ! Let 's get him to a doctor . Watch out . He 's got some kind of corrosive shit on his hands . Come on . Take it easy , mister . We 'll get you some help . All right ? The sky . It fell from the sky . What 's he saying ? He 's in shock . Let 's just go . Get in the car . What for ? There 'll be a lot of explaining to do , and you 're part of it . Are you going to get in the car , or am I going to make you get in ? What 's the matter ? You worried about a little insurance claim on Daddy 's car ? Maybe I will come along just to make sure you don 't blame it all on me . Are you two finished ? Whenever you 're ready . - Excuse me , nurse . - One moment , please . How may I help you ? We 've had a car accident . This guy needs a doctor . He has something on his hand , too . Some kind of acid or something . Does he have Blue Cross ? - I don 't know . - Medical insurance of any kind ? I don 't believe this shit . We don 't even know who the guy is . The doctor 's with another patient right now . Could you put this gentleman in Room 3 , please ? You 'll have to fill these out . Okay . Take it easy , old dude . These guys are going to fix you right up . Where are you going ? These people don 't give a shit about explanations . If you need me , you know where to find me . I bet you 've had better first dates . I don 't mind . You want a soda ? That would be great . Something diet . Absolutely . At this point the prognosis is very positive . In cases like this , the question is always the quality of physical therapy . The follow-up to any operation is to a great extent ... Doctor , come in here quickly ! - I 'm with a patient ... - There 's a man dying in here ! Hurry ! Excuse me a moment . Is this the hand injury ? What is this ? That thing on his hand . Nurse ! - Sheriff 's Department . - Get me the Sheriff ! It 's an emergency . Paul ? Geller speaking . Sheriff , this is Paul Taylor . Paul , what 's wrong ? I 'm at the Arborville Hospital . An old man 's just been killed down here . - You said " killed " ? - Yes , sir . You sit tight . I 'll be right down . Who else is involved ? I 'm with Meg Penny . - And Brian Flagg was here earlier . - Flagg ? Where is he now ? Paul ? Paul ! I did see it , Dad . It killed Paul . Sheriff . How about it , Herb ? Can we take her home ? You may as well , Tom . Make sure she gets a good sleep . We 're not going to get anything out of her tonight . She 's hysterical . I have to call Paul Taylor 's folks . They haven 't heard from him . Let 's face it , Bill . They 're not going to . You get that to Sacramento tonight . And I want the autopsy pronto not next week . Jesus wept ! Herb , you okay ? Taylor was a good kid . I want the son of a bitch who did this . I think we 've already got him . Scott ! Cut it out . I told you . Come on , Vicki . You 're wearing my ring . That makes you my girl . Doesn 't that count for something ? What are all those lights down there ? Isn 't that the hospital ? It 's probably a promotional gimmick . They 're giving away free tonsillectomies . I think that you 're about ready for another one of my famous ... - ... cherry coolers . - I think I 've had enough . Nonsense . You 've never had enough . My very own blend of special imported liquors . Okay . It 's like a steam bath in here . Here 's your drink , Vicki . Hot as a dog out there tonight . That 's a ... That 's a nice blouse . Nice material . It must be hot , though . I 'll just undo one of these for you . That 's better , huh ? Oh , no ? Oh , well . I 'll just undo another one then . Okay . Oh God , Vicki ! No ! I shouldn 't have let her go out with the son of a bitch in the first place . Lower your voice . That poor boy 's probably dead . I want to know what happened out there tonight . Whatever it was that Flagg kid was behind it . It 's about time they nailed that little psychopath . His arse is going to fry this time . Believe me . Here , take this . I don 't want it . Come on , honey . You have to get some sleep . That 's my good girl . Now , just let it alone . I 'm sure the police will have this whole thing settled by the morning . Come on . Mum ? You don 't believe me either , do you ? You 're home now . You 're safe . That 's all that matters . Look at him . He 's too stupid to know how much trouble he 's in . Why don 't you wise up ? I told you everything . I 'm getting tired of hearing myself talk . We 're not boring you , are we ? A bright kid like you ? Am I under arrest ? Because if I am , I want a lawyer . Now he wants a lawyer . That 's right . If you 're not booking me , I 'd like to leave . Either way , I want you out of my face . Oh yeah , hard-arse ? I 'm in your face to stay . What are you going to do about it ? Go ahead , hit me ! Go ahead . Any luck with his mama ? I can 't seem to find her . That 's not unusual , is it ? She takes vacations with Johnnie Walker Red and anyone else who happens to be around . We could call his dad , if anyone knew who he was . Call a shrink . I 'm a broken man . You think this is a joke ? Turn him loose . We got eyewitnesses placing him at the crime scene . We got no motive . No evidence . He hasn 't got a drop of blood on him . - Flagg 's a punk . But he 's no killer . - I think it 's a mistake . Your objection is duly noted . Now turn him loose . We got work to do . Go on . Take a hike . Brian ! I need to talk to you . What the hell are you doing here ? Look , I came down to bail you out . What do you think they are , Neiman-Marcus ? They don 't take plastic . Look , I appreciate the thought . Now , go home , okay ? I need to talk to you . I 'm sorry about your boyfriend . I really am . I 'm tired and hungry , and I 'm not in the mood for conversation , okay ? George . Frannie . Que pasa ? Hey , hotshot , we 're closed . Come on . I 've been dumped on all day . Give me a break . What 's the matter , dear , tough day at the office ? Well , grill 's shut down . How about a sandwich ? Beautiful . You don 't give up , do you ? I need your help . For three years in school you haven 't said shit to me . All of a sudden you need my help and we 're best friends , right ? Nobody believes me about what happened tonight . What did happen ? You were there . You saw . All I saw was an old man with a funky hand . That 's all I saw . Thanks . Can I get you something , hon ? No , thank you . The thing on that man 's hand killed him and then it killed Paul . And whatever it is , it 's getting bigger . Is that what you told the cops ? Do you mind if I ask you a personal question ? I know you 're the homecoming queen type and all , but are you strung out on something , or what ? You 're just the same . What are you talking about ? You act like you 're different . You put on this big show . But you 're just like everyone else in this town . You 're full of shit , Flagg ! Wait a second ! Calm down , all right ? I 'm sorry , okay ? Come on , sit down . You okay ? You want something to eat ? Here . Go ahead , it 'll make you feel better . Unbelievable . It 's just that I 've never heard you say " shit " before . What was that like for you ? We 're coming up empty here . Should we head to the foothills ? Negative . I 'd rather have you patrolling the streets . We 'll start that at first light , when the state police come in . Ten-four . You look exhausted . It 's been a long night . Thank you . It 's going to be even longer . That 's the truth . One deputy and six volunteers . I feel like the one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest . You 're doing all you can , Herb . This isn 't your normal , Friday night drunk . Something wrong ? I 'm just worried about a friend of mine . I guess I 'm worried about everybody tonight . Dessert . Fran . That sandwich busted me . On the house . Last two pieces . Eat up , or I chuck it in the garbage . Thanks . Shit . Here . I 'll get that . I 'll get it . - Here . Knock yourself out . - Well , thanks . What is this ? Don 't touch him ! Fran , come on ! In the freezer ! Hear anything ? I 'm okay . I 'm going to get us out of here . I promise . Come on , answer ! Your call can not be completed as dialled . Please check the number , and dial again . - Sheriff 's Station . - Help me ! Get me Herb . Get Herb Geller . He went down to the diner . You ready ? Okay . Great . I killed the strawberry jam . Let 's get out of here . The front door is locked . That 's okay . I got a key . Merciful God . Hello ? Is anybody hurt ? We need to see the Sheriff ! I don 't know where he is . Sheriff 's Department . Please hold . What about Briggs ? I can 't raise anybody . All I 'm getting is static . Sheriff 's Department . Please hold . The last I heard from the Deputy , he was on his way up to Elkin 's Grove . Elkin 's Grove . That 's where I found the old man . Come on , let 's go . It looks like he left in a hurry . He 's got to be around here somewhere . In the woods . In the dark woods . Right . We could wait here . I never thought I 'd go out of my way to find a cop . Hello ! I feel like fucking Hansel and Gretel here . We should have brought bread crumbs . Wait . I think I hear something . What the hell is that ? Put those weapons down . We 're here to help you . - Name ? - Meg Penny . - Are you a resident of Arborville , Meg ? - Yes , I am . Have you experienced any vomiting , nausea or diarrhoea ? Back off ! Hey , pal . You want to fill us in ? Who the hell are you people ? I 'm Dr. Meddows . We 're a government sanctioned , biological containment team . " Biological containment ? " We 're microbe hunters , young lady . Flagg ? What are you doing here , boy ? The men from Glad here are showing us how to keep our leftovers fresh . They 're here on business . They don 't have time for bullshit . Okay ? Colonel , has the Deputy been briefed in detail ? Yes , sir . I 'm heading to town now to get started . Splendid . Colonel Hargis will arrange an escort . What is going on over there ? That 's the source of our worries . A troublesome souvenir from space . - What ? - A meteorite . Don 't get too close . There 's danger of contamination . I don 't understand . Let me tell you a story . The dinosaurs ruled our planet for millions of years and yet they died out almost overnight . Why ? The evidence suggests that a meteor fell to earth bearing an alien bacteria . Plague ? Is that what this is all about ? Prevention . And you think this meteor brought some kind of a killer germ ? It 's something I 've expected and prepared for , all my life . Your meteor brought something all right . But if it 's a germ it 's the biggest son of a bitch you 've ever seen . What 's the matter ? Isn 't it awfully late to be trimming the hedges ? Maybe this guy 's a peeping Tom or something . So , let 's give him something to peep at . Wait a minute . Hockey season ended months ago . He 's going to get the camp counsellor with the hedge trimmer . But the girl gets away . She 's going to run into the lodge and hide , but he 's going to get her anyway . Please be quiet . You shut up ! Hey ! You 've got to shut up . If you get caught your mum 'll kill me . Get your feet off the seat ! Anthony , come on . Jerk . What a wimp ! Check out the body on the blonde . Wonderful . Yeah ? It 's Hobbs . It 's boiling up here . Is the air conditioning on ? It 's on full blast . It must be blocked up or something . There 's nothing wrong with it . Come up and see for yourself . Hobbs , are you in here ? I can 't begin to thank you both . This information is incredibly valuable . Please , get in . - Where are we going ? - Back to town . Arborville is under quarantine until we 've isolated that organism and checked every living soul for signs of infection . - ln the meantime , we 're your prisoners . - Not at all . You 're my patients . Sounds like the same thing to me . Young man , please , step into the van . Thanks for the offer , Doc . But my bike 's back there and we can make it back on our own . By the way , I love your tailor . I got to get me one of those . Get in the van . Van ride sounds nice . Clear . - lt 's locked . - So what ? Brian , what is with you ? You 're acting like a complete jerk . I have a problem with authority figures . What are you doing ? We ought to get out of here . Take my bike and blow this town . It 's getting thick around here , don 't you think ? That 's crazy . These people are here to help us . Come on , Meg . We don 't even know who they are . NASA ? CIA ? The Royal Canadian Mounties ? All I know is I saw a bunch of unmarked trucks . I think this whole thing stinks . Well , we can 't just run out . Let 's just think of it as looking out for our best interests . You coming ? Brian , I have to go back . My family 's there , people that I care about . I 'm going . If you 're smart , you 'll come with me . Then go . Take care of yourself . That 's the only thing you 're really good at . No one else ever volunteered for the job . Christ , Flagg . A cheerleader . Come on , ma 'am . There is no cause for alarm . I repeat , there is no cause for alarm . This is a precautionary quarantine , due to a potential biological hazard . Please proceed toward Town Hall in an orderly fashion . Mum ! Dad ! Meg ! Thank God you 're all right ! Honey , is Kevin with you ? No . Isn 't he staying at Eddie 's house ? Eddie says they were staying at your house . Oh , God ! He must 've snuck off to that damn movie . What movie ? You didn 't tell me about any movie . Sir , my little brother is at the movie theatre on Main Street . We 're going by sector . We 'll be there soon . - You don 't ... - We 'll handle it . Back in line . Seems you 're doing nothing . You on a break ? - Look , Mr ... . - Don 't " Look , Mr. " me . I pay taxes . I pay your salary . I want you to find my son ! I know you 're upset , but get in line we have everything under control . Did you know that ten years ago tonight , there was a horrible murder in this house ? - No way ! Come on . - This man ... You 'll love this . He hot-curls her to death . Mister , we 're trying to watch a ... My zipper ! Come on ! Hurry ! Your feet ! No ! Hurry ! Here ! Open it up ! Eddie ! Hurry ! Go ! Go ! Come on , Meg ! Meg , come on ! - Alpha Team , do you copy ? - Affirmative . Status report ? Highway 31 closed . Phone lines down . We 've got this town locked up tight . On up . We suspected that conditions in space would have a mutating effect on bacteria but this ! Its activity threw the satellite out of orbit . Correct . Our little experimental virus seems to have grown up into a plasmic life form that hunts its prey . A predator . It 's fantastic . Sir , the organism is growing at a geometric rate . By all accounts , it 's at least a thousand times its original mass . This will put U.S. Defence years ahead of the Russians . You don 't understand . At this rate , by next week , there may be no U.S. Nonsense ! All we have to do is contain it . As far as the locals are concerned this is simply a medical quarantine . Nobody gets in , or out . Dr. Meddows , just for the record I don 't agree with any of this . Those people 's lives are at stake . Don 't you think I know that ? This isn 't one of your textbook exercises , Mr. Jennings . This is an experiment in biological warfare , or hadn 't you noticed ? That organism could be the greatest breakthrough in weapons research since man split the atom . What we do here will affect the balance of world power ! Of course there are lives at stake . Whole nations , in fact . And that 's far more important than a handful of people in this small town . And that is my cross to bear Mr. Jennings . Now , carry out your orders . Yes , sir . Colonel ! Colonel , we 've got a sighting . Hargis here . An eyewitness saw the organism pursue civilians ... - ... into the sewers . - lt 's got Kevin , Eddie and Meg down there . You 've got to do something . Excellent ! We need a schematic of the sewers . We 'll contain it down there . I want that organism alive . What about the civilians ? They 're expendable . Get up . Stop him ! Attention ! We have an infected civilian trying to escape . Stop him before he reaches a populated area ! Halt , or we 'll open fire ! I repeat : Halt , or we 'll open fire ! Turn ! Handicapped persons , or persons in need of special assistance may report to the Blue Station , located on the north lawn . Dr. Sims and Dr. Divatni , please report to Med . Unit 1 . - Are these the schematics ? - Yes , sir . The whole town 's sitting on a system of aqueducts run off from the mountains . Can the organism be contained ? There seem to be three main junctions . Here , here , and here . If we close off those valves , I think we got it . Is it still after us ? I don 't think so . I 'll be good , I swear . I 'll never see a movie , ever again . It 's going to be okay . Let 's just find a way out of here . This way . Baker Team , we place you 80 metres south of Valve 2 . Come on . That 's our way out of here . Watch out for the rat . What rat ? Run ! Run ! Get up the post . Move ! Come on , climb ! Go ! No ! Get him out of there ! No ! Come on ! I can 't get through ! You can make it , Meg ! Come on ! Run , Kevin ! Run ! We have orders not to shoot ! Run , Kevin ! Go to Town Hall ! No ! But , Meg ... Do it now ! What are you doing ? Hang on ! Brian ! - You all right ? - Yeah . Forget about it , Brian . Let 's go . Forget about it ! It got them . Bigelow and Wilson . How do we get out of here ? They were trying to scream . Inside it . Trying to scream ... Listen to me ! How do we get out of here ? Brian , he 's hurt ! I think we 'd better go now . Baker Team , Baker Team , what the hell 's going on down there ? We 're coming up ! Close the manhole . That 's my man down there ! We 've got to contain that thing . Now , close it off ! That 's an order ! Do it . Hey ! No ! You son of a bitch ! Colonel , you can 't ! That thing 's down here with us ! Meddows ! Do you hear me , Meddows ? Talk to me , man ! Meddows ! The water 's rising . It 's coming for us . I thought you were going to take care of yourself . I guess I blew it . I 'm sorry , Meg . I really am . This thing work ? - Does this thing work ? - It won 't do any good . Not against that thing . All right , Meddows . If you won 't listen to me listen to this . Shit ! Fire in Sector 2 ! Charlie Squad to Sector 2 ! All right , people , please stay where you are ! Stay out of the street ! Mobile weapon units to Sector 2 ! Mobile weapon units to Sector 2 ! We got a man down in Sector 2 . On the double ! Flagg ! Drop it ! Stay back . It 's a lie ! All of it ! I said , put it down ! I 'll blow you out of your shoes , boy . Shoot him . Freeze , mister ! All right , hold on . Everybody just lower your weapons . Hold your positions . Don 't come any closer . He 's infected ! Contagious ! He 'll spread a plague through this place and kill all of you ! Listen to me , Briggs . Think for a minute . Do you think an army of guys , in plastic suits , show up every time a meteor falls ? Shoot him . That 's a direct order ! How do you think they got here so quick ? - How did they know when to come ? - Shoot ! Damn it , shoot ! I 'll tell you how ! That meteor is manmade ! Some kind of a germ warfare test they fucked up ! Don 't try it ! Let 's scrag that son of a bitch ! Satchel charge ! Short fuse ! Chew on that , slime ball . What 's happening ? I think you pissed it off . Go ! My God ... - ... the day has come . - Reverend , come on ! You don 't understand . This has all been prophesied . Move ! Get out , everybody ! Everybody , back ! He ran for it , Meg . Let 's go ! Move ! Come on . Reverend ! Meg , look out ! It 's the cold . It can 't stand the cold ! Hurry ! Barricade all the entrances ! Get some more CO2 over here ! Look out ! Coming through . It 's empty , Meg ! Get back ! Stay here ! And the great voice spoke to the seven angels and said : " Go your ... " There ! Right there ! It 's out ! Find some more ! Help me . Come on ! You can do better than that ! Come on , you son of a bitch . What a rush . Hey , man I told you we 'd get snow . You got to have faith . I wonder if I 'm covered for this sort of thing . Dave , bring in the dump truck . We better get this thing to the icehouse before dawn . The will of God is written in the sky in fingers of flame . Wormwood falls from Heaven consuming sinner and saint alike ! Who shall be lifted up to rapture when the judgement trumpet blows ? None but the faithful brothers and sisters ! None but the faithful . When , Reverend ? Ma 'am ? The day of reckoning , how far off ? Soon , madam . Soon . The Lord will give me a sign .

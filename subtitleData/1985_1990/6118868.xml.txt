 [ mùan on radio ] Six forty-five AM , here on North Port . And the temùperature on the island is a bracing 62 degrees . You 're listening to WNPT , serving up a non-stop mùenu of light rock , news , and white lavender . For all you- - uh , for all you mùorning coffee achievers . Seemù to be having somùe technical difficulties . Always good for a light laugh , in mùy book .

Listen , Richard , mùy switchboard 's been buzzing with strange calls . ltemù one , Roger Gordon didn 't comùe homùe last night . - And-- - Let me guess , uh , tourist girl is missing ? That old lighthouse does it every timùe , doesn 't it ? Anyway , I told his mùomù you 'd check up there . ltemù two , that dog at the Intec trailer is still barking . Here 's a thought- - send the dog after the Gordon kid . ltemùs three , four , and five- - Mrs. Pennington , three timùes she calls about pages falling out of her books . Richard ! Are you still with mùe ? Yeah , Millie , I 'm here , I 'm here . Yeah , I 'm on my way to the lighthouse , okay ? That 's it for now . - Oh , bite mùy tongue . - What is it ? The mùayor 's birthday is Sunday and there 's somùebody , a vip , comùing in on the mùorning plane . You know , a surprise . I take it that mùeans you 'll head out there . I 'm on it , Millie . Homer ? Hey , you want to go huntin ' today , Homer ? I 'm always on the hunt , Jake . Oh , yeah . [ laughs ] Homer ? You got pests , Chief ? Yep . Why , I know about pests . If you wanna stop ' em , you gotta do one thing- - - What 's that ? - You gotta- - Uh . Don 't leave food out . Thanks , Jake . Mornin ' . - Hey , Richard . - Fair Lillian . Chief 's got pests . Now , you leave him be , Dad . Betcha it 's bugs . At the store , if it 's not rats , it 's bugs . Rats is the worst and don 't you tell me no different . North Port 's a damn floating ' cesspool , you ask me . Do you mind , we 're eating here . [ cook ] Oh , sorry . I went over to the mainland yesterday . I wondered where you were . I got you somethin ' . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Hmm . Ooh . Eh ? You 're one mean piece a law enforcement , sheriff . You bet I am . Drop by later ? After I tame these mean streets . Hi . Hi . - So , thanks a lot- - - So , if I was- - After you . No , I don 't know what to say , it 's been so long . - [ sighs ] - How ' bout , " l missed you ? " I missed you . You look good . Thanks , so do you . So , you sheriff now ? . Mm-hm . Your dad retire ? He died . I 'm sorry . It was a while ago . What happened to Dan 's Bar ? Oh , they tore it down . [ Beth ] Everything 's changed . [ Richard ] lt 's four years , Beth . [ femùale ] Richard , Richard ! Yoo hoo ! [ siren wails ] - Over here . [ womùan ] I 'mù pleased that you are comùing . It certainly took you long enough . Doesn 't that Millie pass on emùergency calls ? Richard , look at this , just look at this . Kids , no respect for property . Hi , Mrs. Pennington . Hi , Beth . Every single , solitary page--torn out . That 's just mice or insects , Mrs. Pennington , they eat the glue out of the binding . Not in every book in the library , overnight ? Who 's she- - how 'd she get a ride ? Oh , my niece--working with Mr. Perkins this summer . So , I 'll check it out . Oh ! Hell to pay with the library committee , Richard . Hell to pay . Oh , say hello to your father for mùe , Beth . The improvements that you and the city council asked me to make are almost done . But time 's runnin ' out . The tourists are almost here . They 're gonna be crawlin ' all over this island before we know it . And I need capital . Now you and Intec both promùised mùe that mùoney . Loan . Yeah , yeah , loan , mùoney- - whatever . I needed it three weeks ago if I was gonna be ready for the season . Listen , Mayor , the bottomù line is this- - Without it , I gotta raise mùy prices . No , you 're not gonna raise your prices and you will get the loan when Intec wants to give it to you , and not before . Now , look , I 'm going to tell you something- - l 'm gonna take the time to do this . Intec is going to take this backward little island into the 20th century . And I will not allow any narrow-minded , provincial , greedy little merchant to drive away the tourists . You 're gonna miss your lunch . You know , Mayor , you can 't control everything on this island . Go away , Sy . How long are you staying ? I don 't know yet . I need to spend some time with my dad . Want to get together tonight ? - 566 - 2728 ? Okay . [ sighs ] Tell your dad happy birthday . [ bass singing opera ] Dad ? Uh , I was looking for a book on the legal precedent- - precedent about a- - bunch of attorneys on this damned island . You look older , Dad . Well , you 're what I wanted for my birthday . I 'm glad . [ seagulls squawking ] Millie , no sign of Roger at the lighthouse . Well , I 'll be dipped . Listen , I 've got five mùore dog comùplaints . You want to check it out or should I just explain that he 's part of nature 's never-ending wonder . You know , like tripe ? On my way . [ buzzing ] [ laughing ] Damn it , Jake ! What if I had my gun out ? Polio sneaks up on ya , Chief . [ laughs ] You gotta keep one eye open . How 'd you get out here so fast ? Ah , never swim in a public pool . Only kiss a woman you trust . Jake , we gotta talk . Uh , yeah . We had this discussion about other people 's property , Jake . [ Jake ] Uh , yeah , [ babbles ] All right , look , this is what I want you to do- - l want you to take the boat back today . I won 't say another word about it , okay ? Today , I 'll take it back today . Thanks , Jake . You gonna marry my daughter , Chief ? I like her , Jake . What happened to Mom 's shell collection ? I ... put everything in the basement afterthe funeral . I mean , you- - a little while later , you know . Beth , I am sorry- - l 'm sorry that I couldn 't help you more . Listen to me , please . I knew you were hurting . I couldn 't even help myself . Beth , I guess I just- - l guess I just don 't want to lose you again , all right ? [ sighs ] I know . [ growling and barking ] [ femùale ] So , the gorilla looks at Lady Di and says , " Richard , are you on your way to Intec yet ? " [ whimpers ] [ buzzing ] Hm . Since when ? [ buzzing ] [ growling ] [ dog howls ] [ moaning ] [ gasps ] Oh , God , Richard . Who could have done that ? It 's okay , you 'll be all right . [ sighs ] Yeah , Richard . Mayor , I just dropped by to see if Elizabeth 's all right . Uh , she 's all right . What the hell do you think happened ? [ sighs ] I don 't know . I already talked to Simpson about going out there . He used to hunt mountain lions . Mountain--why , you think it 's an animal ? I hope so . - Dad ? - Uh , good night , Richard . Elizabeth , hi . Hi . Well , Richard , I would hold off on Simpson . It 's Intec 's land , they 'll probably want to take care of it themselves , yes ? Seems to me , this is everybody 's problem . Yeah , I 'll call ' em first thing in the morning . - Wanna get some fresh air ? - Mm-hm . You know , the whole time I was growing up , all I could think about was moving to the city . Then when I moved to the city , all I could think about was coming back here . Why didn 't you ? So , why is your old hideout all fenced off ? Intec 's building condos up there . Yourfather made a deal with them to develop the island . North Port , the new yuppie heaven . Well , Elias is just trying to give people a reason to stay here . [ Elias ] No , don 't try to stall mùe on this . No , I don 't know for certain what it was . But I 'mù sure we both understand the imùplications , huh ? I worked on this newspaper . I wrote about traffic accidents and smog levels . Mark , my editor , always says that the only people who truly like L.A. have never lived anywhere else . You quit ? It 's , um , open-ended . Mark 's a friend . Better go . Richard , I 'm sorry . I never knew why you left , Beth . I left because ... because I 'd always been treated like I was 17 here . And ... I left because I needed to feel separate from the island . And I needed ... to feel separate from my dad . Separate from me ? No , Richard , not from you . My dad was ruining that too . Richard , don 't be angry with me . Glad you 're home . [ gunshot ] [ gun cocks ] Take your last poison rat breath ! Ha-ha ! [ laughs ] [ squeaks ] Ahh-hh . [ squeaking ] Show yourself ! [ laughs ] Death comes slow to those who run . [ laughs ] [ squeaking ] [ buzzing ] [ babbling ] Just leave mùe alone ! [ yells ] [ screamùing ] [ screamùing ] Homer ? Whoa ! [ chuckles ] Hi , sheriff . Yeah , Homer , look- - Geez , you know , I was reading the darnedest thing last night , sheriff . How long you reckon a man could last in Alaska , middle a summer , buck naked ? I 'm not too good at riddles , Homer . Oh , this ain 't no riddle , I read this in Amùerican Entomùologist . - Three days . - [ chuckles ] Uh-uh . I give up . - Twenty minutes . - That 's swell , Homer . You know why he 's only gonna last 20 minutes ? Huh , huh , huh ? I don 't know , Homer ! 'Cause after 20 minutes , mosquitos woulda sucked out every pint of blood in him . Wow ! Listen , Homer , will you spray my place ? Well , not today , sheriff , I gotta go spray the cabins . I 'll tell you what I 'll do , though- - [ recites poisons inventory ] Ah , Kruptonetta . Here . You take this , and you call me in the morning , okay ? Okay , like to stay , but gotta go sheriff ! It was stripped to the bone . That dog was dead before it knew it . Bone ? Fouryears is a long time . So , how 'd the sheriff take it ? Don 't let me interrupt you boys . Hello . Awfully quiet in here this morning . Mornin ' sheriff . Say , I hear Elizabeth 's back . Now , how long has it been sin- - Denver omelet . Yesterday ! [ bang ] Sure , well , right away . [ beeping ] Gotta go . MayorJohnson . Oh , no , pleasejust call me Elias . We 're not very formal here , on the island . Dr. Hubbard . Of course , we could change that . Allow me . Somebody else supply these units ? No , they 're ordered by me . So , what 's up , Elias ? Dr. Hubbard , this is Richard Tarbell . - Coffee , Mayor ? - Richard is our- - No , thank you . He 's a new sheriff , he sort of inherited thejob from his father . Dr. Hubbard is here to check on the animal bites on the dog . The carcass . Well , Simpson is getting ready to go up and hunt fortracks . Richard ... that 's private property , and I 'm sure that Intec would preferthat Dr. Hubbard continue the investigation from here on in . Have you ever hunted , doctor ? Often . [ flies buzz ] Thank you . Did you ever have a dog , Dr. Hubbard ? Not until now . [ beeping ] Let me know what she finds . [ Millie ] Richard , I know you 're there , I can hear you breathing . Listen , Jenny Pennington called , you know the ditz working at Perkins mùarket ? She 's got somùe kinda problemù in the mùeat departmùent . Millie , get on the horn to Intec Corp. Find out the official capacity of a Dr. Morgan Hubbard . Morgan Hubbard , that 's a real namùe ? What the heck you got out there , Richard ? It 's an itch I gotta scratch . is it them ? When I came in this morning , you know , it was alljust like this . Weird , huh ? Where 's Perkins , Jen ? Boss is fishing , I 'm watching the store by myself . God , he 's gonna be so pissed . Do you think this is ajoke , or something ? I mean , in my dorm at school , they used to play pranks . And , you know . Well , some of these tourists have a strange sense of humor . Perkins has mice , doesn 't he , Jen ? Uh-huh , I thought of that too . But you know what ? Bizarre . Ooh . Yuck ! What the heck 's goin 'on around here , sheriff . We have ourselves a trap . Place the resonator in the ground while I initiate the homing cycle . Okay . [ thumping ] That 's adequate . Now we 'll get some bait . [ mùeow ] Kitty ? [ sighs ] ls this going to be much longer ? I hope not . [ buzzing ] lf you 'd like to , there 's one good restaurant on the island . Jesus Christ . [ screeching ] I need a place to work . [ bell rings ] [ bell rings ] Very brave , very strange creatures . The way they don 't run from the light as one would expect them to . Yeah . Doctor ... let 's not get off the track . The point is , can we contain them , right ? The way they collect on the carcass , they 're- - they 're belligerent . Almùost warlike . You done yet , Mr. Exterminator ? Lillian , I keep tellin ' ya , I 'm not an exterminator . I 'm a pest control agent . It 's kinda hard to exterminate a species that 's been around for 25 million years , when the only natural predators it 's got is me , yourfoot , and some sticky paper . And I 'm sure they 'll all be at the beach sunbathing long after humanity blows us all up . Uh- - Finish thejob , Homer . Yeah . Hi . Long time no see . Hi . [ Lillian ] Heard you were back . [ Beth ] Yeah . Are you staying ? I don 't know yet . Try to decide whether to move back . Well , honey , I 'm on the forty side of thirty . I make a living serving broken eggs to yokels . My dad spends his leisure hours in a garbage dumùp . And when you 're not around , the one man in town worth walking across the street for comes to see me . So , you decide . Uh- - You done , Homer ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . You open , Lilly ? Yeah . Coffee ? Yes , please . [ buzzing ] Hand me my scalpel , will you ? It 's in the case . I so admire these nymph cockroaches- - their ability to reproduce without the contribution of their male counterpart . [ buzzing continues ] What is it ? My hand . They 're biting my hand . Take your hand out . Take your hand out ! Jesus . It 's unbelievable . [ buzzing ] Uh ! [ sighs ] Stop screwing around and kill them right now , please . That 's precisely what I intend to do . Good , do it . [ motor whirs ] [ buzzing ] What exactly is this ? It 's called Retenone . All right , you tell me when . Now . Hm , I 'll have to try a higher concentration . [ sighs ] Do you have enough with ya to gas all of them ? Retenone in the dosage that I just used , is lethal to human beings . My God . God almighty . Why the hell did I listen to them ? All right , why did I listen to them ? We can- - we can control it . It 's- - All right , I 'm going to evacuate the island . No , there 's another way ! Give me 24 hours . Don 't- - don 't lie to me ! Twenty-four hours , that 's all I 'm asking . [ buzzing ] All right . [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] [ siren wails ] What seems to be the problem , sheriff ? Homer ? Yeah . Sheriff ! Homer ! Yeah ? Got somethin I want you to look at . Yeah , yeah . You gonna tell me what it is ? Periplaneta . They 're big periplaneta , but periplaneta just the same . And what might that be in plain English ? Cockroach droppings . Come here . Could roaches do that ? Yeah , if they have a knife and fork . [ Millie ] Sheriff ? Sheriff Tarbell ? Yeah , Millie . Got the scoop on Dr. Morgan Hubbard . Couldn 't get anything fromù lntec- - very unpleasant people . So I had Mrs. Pennington take a gander at the Who 's Who of Medicine , Guess the pages didn 't fall out of that one , eh ? Anyway , seemùs Hubbard was a hotshot in genetics at MlTa few years back , until they kicked her out . For what ? Illegal experimùents . Geez , what kind of experiments are illegal ? You find this sheriff as much of a pest as I do ? [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] [ screams ] [ buzzing ] I 've had enough of your patronizing , Elias . Bringing in outsiders is not the solution . All right , tomorrow , dawn , I 'm taking a search party into those caves and I 'm gonna put a stop to this ! No , you 're not . The situation is under control and you 're gonna leave it alone . It doesn 't look under control to me . Stay out of those damn caves until I tell you different , all right ? I wasn 't thrown out of mit , sheriff . I left voluntarily . I found the whole situation there rather ... stifling . You know there will comùe a day when there will be no need for pesticides or chemicals . All these things that harm us . Genetic engineering is part of our future . Now , it is true that I have done some experiments here , at North Port . Of course , I can 't tell you the exact nature of the experiments . But I can assure you that I 've got everything completely under control and that by tomorrow , it 'll all be over . Dad , are you going to come clean with us , or not ? Elias , I don 't think there 's any point- - Doctor , shut up ! Look , if you don 't think there 's anything unusual going on up in those caves , why don 't we go take a look right now ? . - No . - Dad , look at me ! It was awful ! I don 't know what 's up in those caves , I don 't know what those things were , but something chased me out of those caves ! Baby , baby , look , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , but you 'rejust going to have to trust me . I wish I could . Tarbell , you stay the hell out of those caves ! My dad always said this day would come . And he hoped I 'd be up to it ... thanks . [ country song playing ] All right , Church shoots a fall away jumper from the top of the key . All right ! Church , don 't play with the garbage . You 're not a raccoon . Yeah , right , Lillian . Shit , oh well . [ sings ] Ow ! [ buzzing ] Jesus H ! - - [ moans ] [ gasping ] [ groaning ] [ femùale ] Intec lndustries . - Yeah , it 's Johnson . - Johnston . No , no T. - Uh , well , Mr. Johnson , - Yes . I 'mù sorry , but Mr. Hauser is unavailable at the mùomùent . Yes- - now , you lis- - listen to me . You tell Mr. Hauser he is to call me immediately . It 's a matter of life and death . Richard , do you have a shirt l could put on ? Uh , one sec . Knock-knock . Thanks . Feeling better ? I 'm good . You know , your dad 's a pain in the ass , but I can 't believe he 'd do anything to endanger North Port . You don 't know my dad very well . After my mother 's funeral , I just wanted somebody to comfort me and to hold . I went up to mùy dad 's roomù and he wasn 't there . But there was a letter on his desk . It was from my mother . It was her suicide note . Beth , it was an accident . She knew how many pills to take . He lied , Richard . He lied to me and he lied to the town . Because for him , suicide 's an embarrassment . [ sighs ] I did miss you , Richard . [ whispers ] I missed you . [ buzzing ] Yeah . Jake ? Ready or not , here I come ! Jake ? Send the women home , it 's time for checkers . [ owl hoots ] Wish you 'd quit moving ' stuff on me , Jake . Jake ? Hey , Jake ? Dead to the world , huh ? Lillian sent the good stuff . Wakey , wakey , Jakey , Jakey . [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] All right , Hauser , you just try concentrating . You 're not grasping this- - if this gets to the mainland , we 'll never stop it . is it possible you 're overreacting , Elias ? If Retenone is lethal to humùan beings , that mùeans evacuation , that mùeans official scrutiny . Hauser , scrutiny is nothing compared to the alternative . Don 't go back to Los Angeles . Come back with me . [ Beth ] Mm . You do still owe me , you know . I 'll show ya . I appreciate that you 're under stress , but I need a clear head out there . All right , you try this- - see if this is clear enough . If you don 't take immediate action , my next call will be to The New York Timùes , is that clear ? That would be a mùistake , Elias . There are mùany heads on the chopping block here . Oh , you try me . Elias , now look , I prefer spraying at night . I 'll get on it now . Stay close . Yeah . Come to L.A. , we 'll call it even . You 'll love it out there . There 's sunshine everywhere and health clubs every three blocks and palm trees everywhere and a real beach without rocks . Just wanna be where you are . [ buzzing ] Ooh , Richard ! Millie ? Mil ? Richard , I was just trying to reach you . Millie , get a hold of Homer . Richard , hold on . Perkins was fishing down near the beach . He thinks he found the Gordon kid and that mùissing tourist girl . Dead . Shoot , I forgot the- - oh , no , no biggie , okay . Uch ! [ sings ] [ TVdialog ] [ snores ] Oh . Oh , you didn 't . Yes , I did . Oh , you shouldn 't . Did you mùake a mùess ? Well , you know if I did , I 'd clean it up . Oh , well , I doubt that . Come on , Aunt Clara , I 'm not always that bad . [ chuckles ] Oh , you 're a piece of work , Jenny . Oh , I know I 've been a pain since I came to stay . But I hope this makes it up to you . Well , you don 't get to bed too late , now . Huh ? That daggone thing 's gonna deafen you ! What ? Oh , stop- - [ groans ] [ pop music plays ] Hee , hee . [ buzzing ] [ chuckles ] Oh . Oh . Oh , no . No , scatter ! Scatter , scatter ! Scatter , scatter , ow , ow ! Jenny ! Jenny ! Jenny , no ! [ mùoaning ] Oh , ow , Jenny ! [ yells ] [ moans ] Entry number 127 . Hybrid periplaneta unstable . No , correction , correction . It 's advanced . Highly superior to the original hybrid . Now let 's look at the magnification of the egg capsules . The egg capsules , having survived the Retenone , have hatched . They 're immune . [ grunts ] Easy , easy , now , I 'm losin ' his head . All right . Uh ! What do you want mùe to do with themù ? Take ' em to Doc Bimstein 's . All right , I 'll see you in town . What a mess . Richard , I have to go back to my dad 's . I gotta force him to tell me what 's going on . Subject 's DNA proves a remarkable capacity for adaptation . [ chuckles ] I did it . Hello ? ... want us to spray . Hello , Hauser ? ... five o 'clock tomùorrow mùorning . Right , 5 AM . Listen , can- - can you hear me ? This line is going . [ buzzing ] [ broken dialog ] ... you understand ? [ Elias ] Hauser , if I can 't evacuate everyone ... Listen , listen to me , Hauser , if I can 't get everyone off the island , we will turn on the lighthouse beam . Confirm ! ... do not spray if lighthouse lit up . Yes , if the helicopters see a beam from the lighthouse , then don 't spray ! You 've got it ? [ buzzing ] Ow ! [ screaming ] No , I cannot change a hundred . [ " La Cucaracha " plays on juke box ] God ! Dessert , anybody ? Refill on that coffee , sir ? What are you staring at ? No , lady , yourtime is up . I 'mù going to evacuate the island . They 're spraying at 5 AM . The roaches are immune to Retenone . Spray if you want , Elias . But the results , when the eggs hatch , will be a species of roaches that no known chemùical can kill . What do you m- - l saw them die ! Yes , but their eggs became immunized . The lighthouse . The lighthouse , light the light . They won 't spray if they see the beam . Quaint , Elias . Elias ... don 't do anything else . [ Homùer ] Right , it 's party timùe , bugs . And I 'mù mùakin ' the cocktails . And I 'm gonna give you the good shit . There we go . I killed your father , I killed your grandfather . Now , by God , I 'm gonna kill you . Eh ? [ zapping ] [ whispers ] Damn ! Hubbard , where 's the beam ? Dad , what 's going on on this island ? You go upstairs and pack . Right now . I 've gotta know what the hell 's going on on this island ? Hubbard ! Dad ? Comùe in , this is Richard . Comùe in , this is Richard . Millie . Millie ? Millie ? Mil . Where the- - Oh , oh , Jesus ! Lillian ? [ whispers ] Oh . Lillian ... sleep in peace . I 'm sorry , baby . [ yells ] Sheriff , sheriff , they killed Jake . They blew- - they blew up my house . The roaches did it , they 're everywhere . The whole town 's dead , Sheriff . Lillian 's dead . Oh , God . What are we gonna do , sheriff , huh ? What are we gonna do ? [ Dr. Hubbard ] Elias , there 's a mùalfunction in the lighthouse beamù . Elias , comùe in . I repeat , there 's a mùalfunction in the lighthouse beamù . Elias , comùe in . Damùn it , Elias ! Beth , I loved your mother , you 've got to knowthat . I know that , Dad . I know you did . Dad , what are you running from ? It 's a mistake . It wasn 't supposed to hurt the island , it was just supposed to help . It was supposed to help everyone . What was ? I wish you were a man . Since you 're not , why are the roaches killing people and how do we stop them ? You can put that gun away , sheriff . It was a normal Intec research study . It took a turn that I didn 't anticipate . I was trying to find an alternative to the pesticides . But over time , roaches become immune to the spraying . She 's right about that , sheriff . So , you invented something . A roach that eats other roaches . Then it was supposed to die out after one generation . It just kept getting hungrier . See , their molecular structures are starting to evolve . Each host becomes a new species with the ability to act together . They 're starting to develop real social instincts . It 's quite lovely , actually . Gee , are you trying to say they 're becoming intelligent ? Possibly . - Or- - - Orthere 's a queen . Which means there 's a nest . Homer P. Birum , independent Pest Control Agent . Why experiment here ? Because if I let them test here , they would invest in the island . Beth , look , don 't look at me like that . I wasn 't- - l wasn 't starting World War lll , for God 's sake . That wasn 't a nuclear plant . This was supposed to be a boon to mankind . It was a chance to rid the world of a pest , an ancient , ancient- - You 've done to North Port what you did to my mother . You destroyed them both . [ lights buzz ] Oh , my God . Now , let me get this right- - Intec 's gonna spray the island in a couple hours unless the lighthouse is lit . And if they do spray , the bugs are dead , but so are we . You 're saying that the unhatched roaches , which Beth saw in the nest , will not only survive the spraying , but be immune to the only spray that works on it now ? . - Great . - Great . Let 's light this candle . [ mùotor starts ] Comùe on . [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ] They 're here . I got it , Dad ! [ buzzing ] I 'm gonna call Richard . Richard Tarbell , Richard Tar- - sheriff Tarbell , comùe in , please . This is an emùergency . Sheriff Tarbell , comùe in , please ! Yes , what is it ? Gimme Tarbell . I 'd like to do that , Elias , but it 's very important that we get the light on . ... the hell do you think you 're doing ? We need some help here , get me Tarbell ! Fire extinguishers- - CO2 freezes the roaches . Oh ! Okay , try that . [ buzzes ] Whoop ! Turn it off , okay . Just keep tryin ' . I 'm gonna check in with Beth . I just spoke to Elias on the radio . He and Elizabeth are just fine . And she says that she loves you , and that they 're counting on you . And we 're running out of time , Pal . Hey , this ain 't no toaster , sheriff . Okay , okay , okay , that 's it . Give it a go . [ buzzes ] Whoops . Dad ? Wait , wait ! The rug , Dad , the rug ! There 's another extinguisher in the cabinet , get it ! - Caught . - All right . Ow , shit . Get away ! - Too many of them . - Dad , let me help you . Get back , get out , get the hell out ! Get out ! Save yourself . Dad ! Open up ! No ! No , Dad ! Hubbard , I said throw the circuit breaker ! Maybe she got lost . [ crash ] [ yelling ] [ groan ] Hubbard ? Sh-hhh . Meow . [ purring ] [ whispering ] lt 's still here . [ purring ] [ screeching ] [ purring ] [ screeching ] Homer , go upstairs and get my gun . - Uh . - No , don 't kill it . What do you want me to do , make friends with it , doctor ? Homùer ? That 's incredible , it 's a hybrid of a hybrid . Whatever they ingest , they becomùe . Homer ? [ growls ] Homer , when I count to three , go upstairs and get the gun . I 'll keep it occupied . - Ready ? - No . One , two , three ! Dr. Hubbard , extinguisher ! [ screeching ] Hubbard ! Spray it ! [ crying ] [ cries ] [ yells ] No bug too big , huh ? [ sighs ] [ buzzing ] [ gasps ] Ow ! Never changes . Yourface has no emotion . I could be dyin ' . It wouldn 't make any difference . Perhaps we 'll get the chance to find out . [ clunk ] Hey , hey ! Four o 'clock , beat the choppers by an hour . [ Richard ] All right , Hubbard , timùe to show us your God damùn nest . [ Richard on radio ] Elizabeth , Elias , comùe in . Elizabeth ? Elizabeth , Elias , comùe in , please . - Richard ? - Elizabeth , Elias , come in . Richard ... I 'mù here . Beth ... is that you ? [ Beth ] Yes , please comùe in . You 're breaking up , Beth . Switch to channel two . Can you hear me better ? Beth , are you all right ? Richard , mùy dad 's dead . I 'm sorry , Beth . Are you safe ? Yes . Richard , I need you . You sure you 're safe ? Roaches are gone ? Beth , confirmù , please . [ whispering ] Beth . Dad . Oh , my God . No , don 't ! No ! [ yells ] [ screamùs ] Elizabeth , can you hear me ? Uh-oh . Hey , sheriff . Lighthouse is out . Shit ! Wait , Homer , Homer , I want you to go to the lighthouse . I want you to work your magic . You got better than 20 minutes . Yeah , uh , hey , sheriff , Right- - Beth , I want you to go with Homer . No , she knows the caves , she has to show me the caves . I know the caves ! Yes , but she 's seen the nests . She knows where it is . Who is in charge here , sheriff ? Right now , I 'm going in ! Uh , sheriff , I don 't know how to drive a car . Sorry . - Okay , just take this key . - Yeah .

 I will never forget that morning . I 'll regret the things I said to my mother for the rest of my life . Shou ! Shou ! Shou ! You 're going to be late . I thought that you would behave better when we got back to Japan . But you 're acting just like you did in the United States . Shou ! Did you dry yourself off ? Did you shut off the shower ? You always let the water drip . Last night your teacher called from the Japanese class . You haven 't gone for two weeks . Friends , friends . That 's burning . Robert and Piggy ? It 's not cool to spend all my time studying . They 'll go back to the U.S. someday . But you 're Japanese . You 'll be here . Yeah , yeah . I know . - Shou ! Where 's your underwear ? - Where 's your bra ? Look how you treat me ! Will you please say something to him for me ? You 're going away for the weekend again , right ? Yeah . That 's burning . Can you talk to Shou 's Japanese teacher about transferring schools ? With you going back and forth to Tokyo ... I can 't handle all these things by myself ! You don 't understand how we feel . If you can 't get into a Japanese school , you 'll always be an outcast here . That 's not my fault . It 's my parents ' fault . Our fault ? It 's all because Dad had to go to L.A. Because of his job ! If Dad couldn 't do anything , how do you expect me to ? What kind of child is this ? Talking back ! I 'm not going to Japanese class . You old woman ! Get out ! You don 't ever have to come back ! Who would want to ? - Buddy ! - Morning ! You know , I 'm scared . I feel like my son has left ... And will never return . Young men grow up and test their limits . Don 't worry . Someday he 'll marry someone like you and forget us little by little . He 's still just a kid . Just a kid . Rain ? Yes , rain ... It 's raining in Tokyo . It isn 't yet ? It will be tonight . Because I 'm coming to see you . Then I 'll pick you up at the station . What time ? Yes . An umbrella ? I won 't bring one . I want to walk with you in the rain . My parents are very fond of you . They want us to visit them again . Thank you . I 'll be a good wife to you . Wait ! I 'm sorry , I have to go . See you tonight , my Rain Man . Cool ! Now I feel like I 'm really alone . Shou ! It 's all over now . It 's really over ? Telephone ... Yes , the telephone . - You ! - Buddy ! What are you doing here ? Yu wanted to play . That 's why Yu followed . 181 people , including 16 teachers , and the entire school has disappeared . It 's been concluded that this could be a time slip situation . From Kobe University , here 's a geologist , Professor Jackie Yamatojiba . Professor , can you briefly explain a time slip ? A time slip ... That 's a difficult concept , dealing with the link between time and space . When the balance is disturbed , a time slip occurs . Of course , currently , this is under investigation . We can 't say for sure ... I saw the news at the station . I took the express train back . I 'm sorry . Are you alright ? It 's my fault . It 's all my fault ! My fault ! I 'm sorry , it 's chaotic here . I 'd like you to continue the point you were making . Where do you think the school and the people went ? I don 't know . The only thing we know is this surviving child . Yes , they 're bringing her up now . She got caught between space and time . She has a flower in her hand ... I can 't say any more . I have no idea what happened to the others in the school ... Mother ... I don 't know what happened to us . We 've gone through the day without knowing anything . I want to go home . I want to see my mother . Mother ... Where is Yu ? I haven 't seen him since last night . Yu ! I wonder what that was ... I found this . Don 't come near ! Everything is mine . Do you understand ? If you come any closer , I 'll kill these kids . It 's their fault . It 's not my fault . If I don 't do this ... Eat ! Mother ! Mother ! Shou ! Shou ! He 's alive ! Emiko ! Mother ! Mother ! Hey ! What are you doing here ? Ma 'am ! He needs me ! Let me go ! I must help him , please ! Emiko ! Emiko ! Calm down ! Let me go ! Wait ! Emiko ! Wait ! Emiko ! Mother ! Mother ! He wants to kill me ! Emiko ! Shou ! My mother helped me . He 's alive ! My son ! - Thank you . - You 're welcome . There was a storm on the second night . We didn 't see any of the teachers . Everybody was tired and went to sleep early . The sound was a soft and gentle melody . The scary monster was calmed , because of Miss Midori 's piano . And that night , I lived to dream of my mother . Where is my home ? Where am I ? Mom ... I cannot ... Who is it ? Did you see ? Please don 't tell anybody . That 's right . Water is necessary . This is our secret , okay ? Yeah . - Promise ? - Yeah . I 'm glad . Everybody else should feel the same way . Shou ! Shou , you 're so cool . Time passed like that . Mother ... Under the sand , we found the monument . We decided to keep it secret . Some people need their dreams . Shou ... You 're not an adult yet . You 're not ready for the world . We decided to take an expedition . Everybody 's fear has brought us closer together . Fear has become such a strong power . Mother ... We decided to take an expedition today . I wondered what exactly we had stepped into . If this is a dream , I hope everything is a dream . I don 't know why . The air smells like home . While we were on our horrific journey , they were having a rough time at the school . You guys must live ! Miss Midori ! Shou ! Come back soon . Shou ! That tunnel ... I wonder what it was . There are many things I don 't understand in this world . Maybe the balance of nature has shifted ... We 're back . Welcome home . What happened to everybody ? We 've been waiting and waiting for you . Every day we wondered where you were . It 's been a month . A month ? We just left this morning ! A month ? Miss Midori ... Miss Midori became a monster . I couldn 't believe what happened in front of me . But crazy things like that couldn 't really happen . No , Miss Midori was killed by a monster while saving us . We decided to avenge Miss Midori 's death . Our strong anger gave us even more strength . Shou ... We lost many in our group . And its all my fault . I wasn 't the best choice for a leader . You are courageous because you see your faults . You are becoming a greater man and a leader . I need your power . I need your help , too . You 're very pretty , Ayumi . Your tears are more beautiful than a lake . Yu ... Yu can go . Yu ... Do you want to see your mom ? Yeah . Then go home . Bye bye , Ya . He 's going home . Going home . I know he is . Yu is going home to his mom . I can hear his mother 's voice . That 's right . Yu is going home to his mother . Yu ... He was too young to be here . Welcome home . Let 's change your clothes . You 'll catch a cold . Do you really think it was a time slip ? All I know is ... they 're gone . And we were left behind . Kids are always going someplace without telling adults . Do you think ... Is that place far away ? That place is somewhere beyond time . It could be very close . But it can 't mix with our time . Could they have gone back to the time of the dinosaurs ? Does it have to be a scary time for them ? Children go to the future . They always do . That 's a basic rule of nature . If I continued to stand here , could the time slip appear again ? Could I go through it too ? Would I go to the same place ? We can 't possibly go to the same time as children . They have taken the love from their parents , and they 'll use it to create something greater . Ma 'am ... My son is there too . A glimpse ... I 'd just like a glimpse of my son as an adult . That 's all I want ! And then my buddy said they were going on a journey . Do you know what a sand tunnel is ? My buddy wanted to see inside the tunnel . That ' s why they went there . Mother , how are you doing ? I haven 't seen you for such a long time . I remember when we were together , but now I have a new life . I have become an adult now . Thank you , Mother . Thank you for all the wonderful memories . I will take them with me forever . Not only tomorrow , but for all time . Because I am the seed born of your love . We will recreate our earth in memory of you . Please keep us in your thoughts forever . Translation by Amy Asai and Thomas Weisser Subtitles by tubesoda for Asian DVD Club

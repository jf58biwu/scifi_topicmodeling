 [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ dramatic music ] [ knock on door ] Are you ready .. Superboy ! You 're like an answer to a prayer . Do you know how many accidents you 're causing ? Oh , believe me . That 's the last thing I wanted to do . Zugar . Professor John Zugar . This experiment I 've been working on went out of control . - Control it , okay ? - I will , with your help . This grid is what 's causing the trouble . If I could raise the energy level the power damage would correct itself . Lemme put it .. if you can use your heat vision and concentrate on that grid my experiment would prove out- - Excuse me . What 's the nature of your experiment ? As fantastic , as far sighted as extraordinary as almost as the brilliant visionary , Percy Stoddard . A prophet before his time . He was denied academy at the national academy of sciences . Oh , but , Superboy , I 'm wasting your time . Please , use your super heat and concentrate on this grid . Eh , if not I cannot be sure there won 't be a .. .. massive explosion . [ upbeat music ] [ music continues ] Uh ! [ indistinct chatter ] You know , Hollywood is full of crackpots but that guy is over board . [ upbeat music continues ] [ music continues ] ( newspaper boy ) Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it . Nazi invaded Poland . Nazi invaded Poland . Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it . Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it . Nazi invaded Poland . Nazi invaded Poland . Hey , mister . The Nazi invaded Poland . Wow ! - If she screams , bolt . - Don 't worry , guys . Aah ! [ intense music ] Oh ! Aah ! [ music continues ] [ groans ] [ music continues ] You said she didn 't have body guards . I didn 't see him in the studio . Hey , I don 't ever wanna meet that guy again . Next time , we use guns . We 'll see how tough he is when he 's hit with a bullet . [ music continues ] - Thank you . - No problem . I 'm Victoria Letour . I 've been researching my new role . What are you playing ? A green beret ? I 'm playing a downtrodden victim with depression . Why would I play a hat ? You don 't know who I am , do you ? I sure do . You 're someone I want by my side , if I 'm ever in a jam . I 'm Victoria Letour . Famous movie star . That doesn 't mean anything to you ? I didn 't say that . I 'm sorry if I offended you . No , no . I 'm not offended . I 'm , uh .. I 'm amazed and impressed by your indifference . What 's your name ? Clark . Clark Kent . Clark Kent . Where are you from ? I 'm not from around here . I 'm from the south . Shuster University ? And you saved me from God knows what . I want to do something for you . Are you an actor ? No . No . Come on , every good looking guy that comes to Hollywood wants to get into movies . Meet at Granite studio tomorrow . I 'll get you a screen test . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? What I want is to find someone . But thanks anyway . Hey , lemme help you find your friend . I know everyone in town . Everyone knows me . They 'd love to do me a favor . Aah ! It 's been doing that off and on for the longest time . [ theme music ] Superboy ! Ha ! Something told me those sudden power surges meant you 're about . What are you so mad about ? I 'm the one that should be teed off . You planned the whole thing , didn 't you ? Tricked me into using super heat and dragged me back to 1939 . Sure . How else could I get your help ? But I didn 't force you to hold on . - That 's your problem . - I want to return . We 've to work out a few problems . Some of the heat shields were damaged on their way . I practically got ' em all repaired . Great , so how much longer ? Two , three hours ? It 's easy . Haven 't found a solution to my other problem . Computer chip that does all the necessary calculations was pulverized in it 's transit through time . You realize , of course , in 1938 they are 10 years or so shy of conceptualizing computers . I 'm conceptualizing punching a hole in the ground - and shutting you up . - You disappoint me . Where 's your eau-de-vie ? Your curiosity ? Your wonder . I got here in 1938 . You didn 't arrive till 1939 . Aren 't you impatient to know how that happened ? No , not from you- - You were hanging onto the time machine . You must have let go before I reached 1938 . That 's why you didn 't travel back in time as far as I did . Alright . Okay . Let me show you something . Now , what do you guess this to be ? A projection of possible space warps . It 's a real estate map of the San Fernando Valley . All property goes for $ 50 an acres now . In our time , $ 300,000 an acre . That 's great . I don 't care about real estate . Ah , short-sighted , uh ? Well , I own 10 acres there now . It 's all because I worked like a dog at two different jobs so I can have enough money to buy it . You 've taken the easy way to earn your pockets . instead of devoting your energy into getting us back . Easy way ? You try throwing 300 pounds of pizza 's towards the ceiling . I got tennis elbow on that job . And don 't be so damn superior . You go and try living on social security in 1989 . Besides , I 'm trying to solve a problem . I taught the science department in the university . They all turned their backs on me when I talked time machines . Please , how long to replace this chip ? Well , I can only contact someone in the science community . If I can locate Percy Stoddard and his miracle calculator . That 's one of his inventions . I bet that could help us . - I 've a thought on that . - I knew things would work out . No . You have a place to stay ? [ instrumental music ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] Victoria ? Hello , again . [ laughing ] It 's a standard greeting . Everyone kisses everyone . - You don 't like it ? - Who said I didn 't like it ? You 're very steady , Clark Kent . I 've got a great teacher . You 're not kidding . - I need a favor . - You got it . You said if I ever needed to locate someone , you 'd help me . I need to find a guy named Percy Stoddard . Percy Stoddard . He 's the technical advisor last science fiction movie I was in . We hired him because he invented something called a .. Miracle calculator . That 's it . We used it as a prop . I need to borrow it . - Ms. Letour . - Uh . Listen , umm . Miracle calculator . Give your address to the script girl . Percy Stoddard and this miracle calculator will be delivered . Standard goodbye . [ chuckles ] That was Joey . He got us booked tomorrow with extras . And get this . The scene they shoot in the cabaret ? A kidnap sequence . And we 're the kidnap gang . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Guess who he saw with our favorite actress ? The same guy she was with yesterday . I 'm upping the ante . The ransom is no longer 100,000 . It 's now quarter of a million . This time , we bump both of ' em . [ dramatic music ] Wow ! Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! That is great . What a time to be alive in the 80 's . And they actually put a man on the moon ? That they did . What ? What ? That they did . It took six of us in a crane to load that thing . My boys said , if you can get it off the truck , you can keep it . [ dramatic music ] It 's Hollywood . Mr. Stoddard , do you think you can adapt this ? I , uh , think so . With Professor Zugar 's help and what he has told me about you with your help too . Well , shall we go to work then ? - Alright . - Ha ha . That 's the 80 's . Uh , Superboy . These connections need to sorted . Uh , now the calculator 's a primitive processing machine . Substituting for microprocessor we lost in our way through time . That 's if we can get it 's memory cord operated to the speed of those transistors . You 're gonna have to use your super freeze breath to bring the temperature of the magnetic core down to somewhere near zero degrees Kelvin . To create a super conductor to compensate for the needed speed . You , uh , sure you don 't wanna come with us ? Oh , it 's tempting , John . Wonders of the 80 's . I don 't think so . I don 't think I can adapt to such a violent change . Mr. Stoddard , because you made it possible for us to return we would like to offer you this gift of 10 acres of land - in the San Fernando Valley . - I think five acres is enough . Gratitude carried too far is ostentation if there 's one thing I can 't stand . Please , gentlemen . I don 't want any of this . You don 't understand . We insist you take this . He can 't come back , unless you take it . Matter of fact , I won 't go back unless you take it . Gentlemen . Thank you very much . I want to thank for being generous with my property . I knew you wouldn 't mind . - I felt we owed him a favor . - Do me a favor . Don 't do me anymore favors . Just apply your energy heat to that grid . - Right here ? - Hmmm . Approximately how long before system reaches full power ? About an hour . Give or take a minute . Adios . Where you going ? You can 't leave now , there is not enough time . ( male # 1 ) Hey , you ! Get over here . Where have you been ? Let 's go get in line over here . You 're supposed to be here at eight o 'clock . I don 't believe it . Nice muscles . Get in line there . Let the director take a look at you . Ms. Letour . Ms. Letour . Would you pose with the group here please ? Thank you . Thanks , Ms. Letour . Alright , you and you . Go to studio two . Sorry , fellas . Director feels like you don 't come across as guys from outer space . [ pleasant music ] [ music continues ] [ indistinct chatter ] Hello , again . I just came by to say thank you for everything . Umm . Clark , I , uh .. I did a little checking . There is no Shuster University in all of Dixie . Or anywhere in the country for that matter . No , not yet , there is not . So , either you 're a fraud or there is something going I don 't understand . I 'm not a fraud , Victoria . That 's your explanation ? It 'd take too long . I 've got plenty of time . Sit right here . Sit . Don 't move . And we gonna have a long talk after this . ( male # 2 ) Ms. Letour ? Don 't move . - Let 's roll it , Lamar . - 25 , take three . [ pleasant music ] [ music continues ] [ explosion ] [ people screaming ] Clark ! [ indistinct screaming ] Somebody help me . Help ! Help ! [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] Stay there . [ music continues ] What the hell is that ? What 's the difference ? Shoot ! [ theme music ] Aaah ! Aaah ! [ music continues ] Aaah ! [ music continues ] Clark , I thought they shot you . Oh , God . I 'm so glad to see you . I was so scared . There 's no reason to be scared anymore . I 'm not , now that you 're here . I 've to go now . Clark . Don 't leave me . I wish I didn 't have to . [ music continues ] Don 't let go . Good morning , and you are ? Lana Lang and this is T.J. of Shuster University Herald . We are here doing a story on Mrs. Savinsky . The quest to the Shuster chair of journalism . Yes . Weren 't you suppose to be here with a Mr. Clark Kent ? - Yeah , hasn 't he arrived yet ? - No . So , what else is new ? We 've had this assignment for three days you think he 'd atleast show up here on time . The will will be read in a few moments . You may wait here for your friend , if you like . Excuse me . Now , why would a woman that nobody has even heard of leave this school two million dollars ? Well , that 's what we here to find out . You know , I read some where that this Mrs. Savinsky was a Victoria Letour . Old time movie star back in the 30 's . Oh , she sure was beautiful . - T.J. ! - Well , it 's about time . T.J. , it 's great to see you guys . It 's uh , good to see you too , Clark . We are ready for the reading of the will . Well , come on . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] Captioned by Grant Brown

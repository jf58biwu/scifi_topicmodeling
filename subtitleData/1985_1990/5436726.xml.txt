 S SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS SPACESHIP SAGITTARIUS Stardust Boys ! However you look at us , we ain 't no Superman We can 't even be stars of the space opera We can 't even save anyone at a critical moment , and won 't show up as you expect . We 're not chic enough for you to have a sigh , Our work is poor , so , no applause deserved . We don 't even appear in children 's dreams , And we are not missed by grown-ups either . But still , We are not totally and utterly useless . Stardust Boys still have some hope ! You know , we , Stardust Boys ... have some virtues after all ... Stardust Boys ! Translation by Utopus Sync by Marian PURSUIT ! TOPY AT A CRITICAL MOMENT [ Sibip singing ] I wonder what Sibip is singing about .. ? Last time , we 've been saved miraculously thanks to that song ... At least , if we still had that automatic translator .. You know as they say : " Don 't cry over spilt milk . " Right , Toppy ? What is it ? Reading again ? You 've already decided baby 's name to be " Live " , or are you still not sure about it ? Could you be quiet a little ? ! I calculate the travel costs and you two are distracting me ... .. well .. 30g of gold total for this ship .. .. 15g for the meals .. Well , no need to be in such a hurry ! The ship which Professor Anne took is only a day ahead of us . We 'll catch up with her eventually if we check around at every stop . [ alien talking ] ? Ah ... Eh .. eh .. You know ... .. Fellas ! I is da captain of thish shipp ! What ? Little , little , I can speak Earthian . .. How ya 'll like yo tripp ? Y .. Yes , very much indeed .. .. Looks like he had a terrible teacher ... [ applause ] Pepo . Pepo . Pepo . Bravo ! Captain .. of course you must understand the lyrics of that song , yes ? Heck , o 'course , darn it ! Then , would you please tell us ? We really wish to know what he 's singing about .. Na .. aa .. aa . Ya 'll , try not to know , art is to not understanad by explain , ya have to catch it by heart ! ... Go ! .. Go ! ... He .. he .. he .. After all , we still don 't know what the song is about .. Oh , you are so obtuse , it means that a song is not understood by reason , but by mind . It 's the realm of Enka ! [ Enka : japanese old-fashioned ballad ] Hi .. hi .. hi .. .. Ya ! .. Ya ! .. Pepo ! Hey , it 's Enka , it 's Enka ! [ sings nonsense ] ... la-sa-gna-a .. Aargh .. ... la-sa-gna-a .. [ muttering ] Ah .. ouch .. ouch .. What the heck did they have to throw things at me for .. ? ! You know , I think there 's something mysterious about Sibip 's song , don 't you think ? This trail leads to Koo-Nyo which takes 4 days . That gal Ya 'll looking ' for , she gonna ride to the end , ain 't so ? Looks like we have to continue by boat trip .. We should find Professor even if we arrive at Koo-Nyo a day later than her . Oh , my , looks like it 's gonna be a long trip .. Ya 'll only paid money till here . Till Koo-Nyo , 3 people , 60g of gold . Don 't be cheap ! Pay out already ! 60g of gold .. ! ... . that 's too .. expensive ! But .. three passengers ... ? .. why only three ? Im a civilized man , and I cannot take money from an artist , this great man here . What ? ! Pepo . Pepo . Pepo . [ alien talking ] I don 't know what to say , for artist 's sake , but what a difference in the way they treat us . Eh ? ! [ chirping ] Hmm .. .. Lunch time ! Lunch time ! I just can 't like foods of this planet , but there 's nothing else for fun about this voyage either , anyway . Let 's go without lunch ! Whaat ? ! I 've calculated the money that 's left over , and almost all the money will be spent until we arrive at Koo-Nyo . From now , only two meals a day ! Two meals a day .. Aah .. .. Got to be kidding ! I failed to eat lasagna back on Earth and now you say only two meals a day ? ! Can 't stand this anymore ! Right , Sibi .. p ... .. ... ? [ Sibip singing ] ... .. ! Pepo . Pepo . That brat , why doesn 't he bring some for us as well .. ? ! Sshh .. Be quiet . ... . A spaceship ... ? Ah , up there ! Where , where ? Oh ? Isn 't that Cosmo Service ? Heck , it 's coming down ! Cosmo Service ? It used to be our rival firm ... but nowadays we 're no match for them , for they 've grown to a gigantic firm .. And what are they doing here .. ? Who knows .. Ah .. Aaah .. Ah .. ouch .. ouch Oh , you are Rana from Space Service Agency .. Hey , Toppy , what a coincidence ? ! Have you come to build toilets again ? Or have you come to do some variety show ? Comedy is your speciality , isn 't it ? You guys usually do that kind of things .. ? I 'm beginning to worry about the future .. Darn it ... Ha .. ? So ... What , is a big firm like yours , doing in such a remote region .. ? Searching for Uranium for industrial use .. We 've established a base in a place called Koo-Nyo . Uranium ! ? Well , actually , today we 're not here for research , but instead for an urgent transportation . Urgent transport ? Got a request from this lady from Earth , that is in the middle of running away from these bad guys . She said the ship is too slow so that she might be caught up soon , so she asked us to take her to Koo-Nyo by our spaceship . What ? However , the transmission got cut off in the middle .. and we didn 't manage to get the name of the ship . Hey , could the name of that lady possibly be ... Ann ... A ... .. " A-RI-A-N-NE , isn 't it ? Oh , what ? You guys are searching for someone as well ? Unfortunately , no . Her name is Professor Anne . Well , let 's meet the captain and ask him to let us check the passengers ' list . Yup . What we gonna do Toppy ? What we gonna do ? Well ... If we go like this , we won 't catch up with Professor Anne ... That is , we 're left with only one choice .. We only have money for a round-trip to Koo-Nyo .. No matter how I think , it 's impossible to go farther than Koo-Nyo .. That means , we give up chasing and go back to Earth .. ! ... Eh .. ? Well That 's our only choice , I guess . Pepo ! Hey .. Let 's go back .. It won 't help even if we chase any further .. I understand how you feel , but this is physically impossible .. At least ... I wanted to hear her reply .. Reply .. ? I ... I ... proposed to Anne .. What .. ? But , before replying to me , she took off .. If she doesn 't like me , she had better tell me so ! Why , Anne ? ! I didn 't know that ... . but ... we 've done all we could ... so ... Hmm .. [ singing ] ... Oh at last , I get my lasagna .. ! Come 'n out already , lasagna ! Rana ! Come 'n out ... Rana ! .. ? Would you come for a moment ? ! Oh , ok . I have a bad feeling .. Right .. ? .. [ Sibip agrees ] Looks like Professor Anne is not on this ship .. Let 's go to the ship that departed a day earlier than this one .. Hey ! How 's it going ? I hope that you find that Arianne lady soon . Thank you for your kindness . See ya .. .. Hm ? Where is Toppy ? Ah ... I think he just went to toilet .. Oh , is that so ? You always get something to do with toilets .. See ya ! Now ! Toppy ! Toppy ! What a man ... to be honest ... He doesn 't have to do that much ... We could simply go back to Earth instead ! You Mr. good nature ! I 'm so frightened ! I don 't wanna do it ! ... AHhhhhh ... Oh , no , this is not good ... . That 's it , it 's Professor Anne .. ... Well , well ... Oops .. Oh no , it 's closing ... Ouch , ouch ... . phew .. Succeeded in clearing the first stage for now , but ... Alright ... Good ! - Begin the mission ! Oh my .. ! How gorgeous ... What a difference from our ship .. shoot .. ... In our company , as you can see , we have the most sophisticated equipments , and our motto is " Swift and Secure " . .. so we 'll arrive at Koo-Nyo in no time ... . [ coughs ] .. ? [ coughs ] Hey , you know .. Who are you , Ryla ? Oh .. ya , it 's me , Ryla .. [ coughs ] ... I caught this nasty cold and .. [ coughs ] .. Remember the ship we popped in at ? The one before picking up Professor Anne ? Oh , ya , the one with that idiot combo from Space Service Agency onboard , right ? [ coughs ] I forgot some stuff on that ship , would you go back there .. ? Stuff ? Oh well , why not , it 's not so far away .. Re .. Really ? ! And what did you exactly forget .. ? .. Oh .. [ coughs ] .. Automatic translator .. ! Such an idiot I am ... Haha .. [ coughs ] ! ? You ! You ain 't Ryla ! You rat .. ! Ah .. ! You son of a .. Ah ! Toppy ! What the heck you think you 're doing ? ! How did they know it was me .. ? Not funny , you idiot ! Only small and medium firms use automatic translators nowadays .. ! We have micro-translators inside our ears .. ! What ! I see , the one you were looking for was actually this Professor Anne , wasn 't it ? ! Bingo ! That 's right ! So , you must be the one that 's hired by Giraffe .. Professor Anne .. Come back to Earth with us .. I 've declined that offer for numerous times by now .. But .. ! I will continue my expedition until I can prove that the advanced race who 've built the Continent of Mu were the alien from this planet . I won 't go back to Earth ! But , Professor Anne .. ! What you 're doing .. ! I 'm sorry , but we gonna have to confine you in the storage . Confine .. ? ! Illegal trespassers must be tried in court for the attempted hijack . That 's ridiculous ! .. Don 't you have a bit of morality ? This planet is still primitive and full of dangerous .. ... you helping a woman go on such adventure alone ... ... how irresponsible ! Our responsibility is to transport Professor Anne to Koo-Nyo ! .. From there on , it 's out of our business ' range . I see , I understand very well now why Space Cosmo Service has grown to become such a huge firm ... ! Splendid ! Well , thanks a lot . Come this way ! Darn it .. ! You don 't care if one 's life could be exposed to danger as long as you make money ? ! Idiot . If you cared for safety and forgot about business , you would go bankrupt ! Professor Anne ! I feel sorry for Giraffe ! I 'm talking about the proposal , you know ! If you don 't like him , tell him so , once and for all ! Hey ! Professor Anne ! Ssh .. I 've brought escape unit for you ... Now ! Professor ! Professor .. So , you 're coming back with me , right .. ? I 'm gonna continue my journey . Then .. Why did you help me .. ? I want you to tell Giraffe that .. about my reply for Giraffe 's offer that night ... .. I will think about it after I prove my theory . Why not now ? Isn 't it the same if you think of it now or later .. ? Do you love him ... ? .. or .. I cannot think of it now .. ! This journey is a must for me to live as an archaeologist ! After proving my theory and making a new phase in my life , I want to think about it seriously If I thought about it now , I would surely fall in Giraff 's arms ... C 'mon , hurry ... Professor , you love Giraffe , right ? .. then why don 't you think about and care for him , rather than for an expedtion like this ? Why don 't you understand ? ! I 'm also freightened to travel on a primitive planet .. I wish I could give up on archaeological studies and live in peace ... but , I detest giving up on things ! It 's cowardly to seek shelter in Giraffe 's proposal , isnt it ? I can 't stand doing such a rude thing to my dearest person ... Because of that , I don 't wanna run away . .. Because , running away .. .. is the easiest thing to do ... Hey , didn 't you just hear someone speaking down there .. ? C 'mon , hurry .. Professor , I understood , Ahh ! Ahh ! You won 't get away ! Hurry up ! Understand why Giraffe came all the way here just for you even spending all his savings .. ! ... You are indeed ... Ah ! Wait , Toppy ! Professor Anne ! - You 'll pay for this next time we meet ! Professor , what do you think you were doing ? I finally came to be able to give up ... Let 's go back to Earth .. Ya .. Right ... Wait for me , dear lasagna .. Go back ? Giraffe , does it mean you don 't care about Professor Anne anymore .. ? What ? You are quite cold considering you 've proposed , aren 't you ? But , we can 't afford travelling costs anymore , so we can 't continue going farther than Koo-Nyo , right .. ? Travelling cost means money . Exact part-time job for ya fellas , isnn 'it ? ! Yeah .. quite ... Pepo ! Pepo ! Listen , he 's the most important guest on this ship , so , make sure you treat him with care .. ! Well then , keep up .. Yes , sir .. ! Do it good , or ya gonna see some blood ! Heck ! It 's easier to go back to Earth , but look now , for being stubborn ! Nothing we can do about it , this is the only job we could get .. Taking care of Sibip plus being his attendant will make us 20g of gold a day . Rana , why don 't you help us ? I 'm not such a good-natured man ! Who ever heard of an adventurer giving a massage to his guide ? ! Ridiculous ! But what ever put this into your head ? About what ? - Oh , you 're acting .. Until yesterday , you 've been saying that we have no choice but to go back to Earth because we haven 't got enough money .. Professor Anne has taught me something that gave me a start . ... ? That " running away is the easiest thing to do " ... It 's not that we have completed our job . As long as we have a chance , we must not give up , but to face it . - Right ... Perhaps then , you will find the answer to your proposal by the end of this journey .. Here we go ! Here , here .. there , there , there ... Pepo ! Pepo ! .. tap , tap .. .. here , here .. .. there , there .. I don 't get it well , but , I think I got some hope back for it .. Thank you , Toppy . .. here , here .. .. tap , tap ... .. here , there .. , here ... ...

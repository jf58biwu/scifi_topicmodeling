Well , I need you bring this woman back to Earth from the planet Vega III . Vega III ? But that planet is located far , far away in space ... ! We can 't go in such far a place now .. !

Give me a bloody break you two .. ! This ain 't a field trip ! Hurry up and get to Professor Anne .. ! I 'm worried .. I know that .. ! Been observing a while now and all you two are doing is crying out loud " lasagna , lasagna " and making absurd phone calls to Earth for numerous amount of times . Be more serious about your job ! Say what .. ? ! What do you mean " absurd phone calls " ? ! Do you know that Toppy 's wife is going to have a baby very soon ... ? ! Have some respect ! Look , I am simply your client after all , and you two are simply my subordinates . So why should I care about your personal issues .. ? I only care about Professor Anne .. ! Oh , you spoiled brat .. ! Chasing after a woman that has a fiancé Don 't you dare to have such attitude ... ! A fiancé ... ? What are you talking about .. ? .. Shut the heck up ... ! ... Aaah .. ! Oh .. Oh ! Meteorite ! Oh shoot ! It has struck right on the primary engine ! Shoot , it is not functioning at all . Oh .. no ... .. wWhat .. ? We have no choice but to build a sub-primary engine and go back to Earth . Go back .. ? No kidding ! But we won 't make it to Vega with sub-primary engine .. Repair it ? Say , can 't you repair it somehow .. ? There is a way to repair it by getting out of the spaceship and fixing it with our hands .. but not this time ... And why not ! ? Primary engine has the most complicated design in this spaceship , so Rana and myself won 't be enough to fix this thing . That 's right . Well , I 'll give you my hand as well ! Hey , no need for your help unless you want to die ... you see , working in outer space requires physical strength ... Mr. Professor , may I ask what your grade was in Physical Education .. ? " 1 " ... [ " 5 " being the highest ] " 1 " .. ? ! Yes .. Let 's go back , to Earth ! Let 's ! But wait .. ! At last , I get to meet with my lasagna .. Initiate sub-primary engine ! Yes ! What the heck you 're doing .. ? ! Oh , I remember now .. Uh .. ? .. that I was at second grade . I took " 2 " in P.E. " 2 " .. ? Please , I beg you , I must get to Professor Anne .. ! Mr.Giraffe , but why , if I may ask .. ? You see , it 's not like that we don 't understand your feelings for her , but you know , there are many others in this world . Professor Anne is already taken by other man , simple as that . Uhh .. Aren 't you misunderstanding something ... ? About what ? Say , she took off from the Earth to get married , right ? Isn 't that right ? Nonsense ! She 's my senior associate at the research institute , she 's quite brilliant and I respect her from deep within my heart . Huh .. ? ! However , do you know about Continent of Mu ? I think it was a continent with highly sophisticated civilization , right ? Correct . However , it is a great myth in our archaeological study circles , regarding the ethnic group which has built this civilization , where they originate from and where they have disappeared to .. What 's that myth got to do with Professor Anne .. ? Professor Anne , who has studied a lot on this subject , recently came to a theoretical conclusion that the ethnic group that had built Civilization of Mu , was not from Earth , but aliens . Aliens ? ! Aliens ? ! Thus , she has announced this theory at the academic conference last month . ... Hence , we will come to a conclusion that the ethnic group that had built the Civilization of Mu was , indeed , aliens ... and moreover , the inscription on a relief , which was salvaged from the Continent of Mu deep within the ocean , seemed to show us the star map which leads to the conclusion that those alien are originated from Planet Vega III . [ contemptuous laughters ] After all , she is a mere woman , she 's mixing up the archaeological facts with her fantasy dreams .. Ridiculous . Ridiculous indeed ... ! After all , it is not possible for a woman to obtain such a high scholarship . [ contemptuous laughters ] Professor Anne has extremely high self-esteem for herself , and I was worrying that she .. .. has gone to Vega III on her own in order to prove her theory is correct .. Is that so .. ? Yes . Mu-ans are really aliens .. ? We do not know that yet for sure , however , what matters most for now is to safely bring back the professor , you know as they say , there are many myths about planet Vega III and there could still be those backward regions which flourished with barbarians and savages . ... Please .. ! .. Let me help you to repair the engine .. ! Please ! ... I beg you ... Eh ee .. Oh .. I understood , allow us to discuss . Professor Anne .. I must find you .. ! Looks like we misunderstood him .. Professor Anne told us that she 's going to get married on the Moon Base in order to get harbored by us .. .. And it seems that Giraffe is really anxious about her safety ... Hmm .. What we gonna do about the repairs .. ? What we gonna do ... ? Of course we ain 't gonna let him do it .. ! So , not gonna do it ? And his grade on P.E. is " 2 " , hear it ? " 2 " . Well , so what we gonna do .. ? Your are the captain , I don 't care either way ... " 2 " on P.E " 2 " on P.E ... . Heck ! Let 's bet on " 2 " .. ! Oh , I 'm glad Is Mr. P.E. " 2 " gonna make it .. ? Rana ! Oh , this is not good . Rana , let 's begin . Roger . Use the extension hands , rotate it 180 degrees . Roger . Good , good , keep it up . Mr.Giraffe , hold it as it is and to the right . Alright , bring it . Easy ... . Oh , watch out .. ! Oh , no ! Help .. ! Mr. Giraffe ! Aaah ... ! Put the lever back to the same position .. ! Are you alright , Mr. Giraffe ? Take off ! .. Hmm .. weird , I fixed it alright .. Give it more thrust . Roger . Maximum thrust ! Hurray , hurray ! This is Spaceship Sagittarius ... Pito ... what ? Baby has been born ... ? ! Boy or girl ? .. Girl ... oh , doesn 't matter , is she healthy and normal ? ! What ? In facsimile .. ? OK ! So , it 's a girl , huh ? Yeah , she 's gonna send the picture in facsimile via Space Communication Media . This is SCM , are you ready to receive in the facsimile ? Ready , ready , don 't be late ! Roger , transmitting , now . Ha haha .. This is impossible ! Apology ! Seems that transmission got tangled with the Moon Zoo .. ! Phew ... Aah ... Hahaa .. You know , this is just the beginning of your hard-ships ... but congratulations anyway .. ! Thank you , Rana .. I 'm so glad for you . Giraffe ? ! I 'm sorry that I have said some harsh things to you . ... Congratulations ! We , too , apologize for misunderstanding you .. .. my apology ... Ha haha .. .. my apology ... .. my apology ... .. my apology ... Ha ha hahaha ..

( Dave ) Where did they come from ? Why are they here ? Why clowns ? They are not clowns . ( Mike ) They are some kind of animals from another world that look like clowns . Shit , Dave . Dave , maybe from the ancient astronauts who came to earth centuries ago and our idea of clowns just comes from them . How come they are not funny ? Maybe they 're from a dying planet . Maybe their sun pooped up and they need a new place to live . Maybe they need us for experiments , for dissection and study . That means they 're intelligent ( Dave ) So why don 't they communicate with us ? I mean , talk to us instead of killing us ? Maybe they 're just cruisin ' through the galaxy and stopped here for a bite to eat . Yeah . Look , everybody , let 's just holf off from the talking , okay ? Let 's not give ourselves away .

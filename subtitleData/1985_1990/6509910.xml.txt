 TUA 35 heavy , descend to 3,000 feet . Minneapolis center , this is Transuniversal 35 heavy descending to 3,000 . Roger , TUA 35 heavy . TUA 35 heavy , could you give me your location ? Ron , where the hell are we ? 25 miles due south on approach descending through 5,000 feet . 35 , what 's your current heading ? What 's his problem ? we 're currently heading ... TUA 35 , turn to heading ... [ Static ] say again , Minneapolis . Jesus ! Down ! oh , my god . down ! Go down ! [ crash ] my god ! We hit them ! Minneapolis , this is TUA 35 declaring an emergency . we hit another aircraft . looked like a 10 . three and four shutting down . we are going down . how much of the wing is gone ? Ron , see what 's left . right . Mr. Smith , I 'm Kevin bryley from Minneapolis . and you 're not doin ' your job . shove these people in a room somewhere . make no statement till I get back . ashby , tell ' em what we need . right . Move it . come on , people . Let 's do it . where 'd the DC-10 go down ? Ten miles south . Jerry , Eli , go take a look . tom and I will put down here . bill . bill . we were just going after the flight-data recorder . you want to do that next ? sure . the DC-10 hit harder than this . what happened here ? he managed to get it level . there 's only three engines . he lost a lot of wing ? we think so . we 've started on the site map . the cops have finally stopped moving things around . look , bill , uh ... We 're being very careful , but we don 't think it 's a structural failure . you have any numbers yet ? yeah , right here . this one had 354 and 13 crew . the 10 had 265 and 11 . [ helicopter ] watch that wing section ! you already have the cockpit voice recorder ? yeah , but it 's pretty battered . they 're working on it now . I want a dub made before you send it to Washington . it might not be too good . it 's a silly rule . why should the boys in Washington hear it first ? I got to hear what they were up against after they hit the 10 . they did their best . you one of Roger 's team ? I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer . I 'm the investigator in charge , bill Smith . I 've read your crash reports . naturally , I 've heard of you , doctor . what 's your interest here ? you want me to leave ? no . It doesn 't matter . all this just seems pretty far removed from your physics lab . maybe scientists should leave the lab more often . they might learn things . Dr. Mayer ! what 's an ecology professor doing here ? you know someone on the plane ? not that I 'm aware of . how did you hear about the crash ? he 's the last guy I 'd expect to find here . he 's been to several midwest crashes . that big one in ' 79 at O 'Hare , he was all over it . I wonder why . I don 't think it will win him another nobel prize . over here ! I got it ! there 's a mob here from Boeing . the man from mcdonnell Douglas is on the way . Wes lake from the FBI is here and the assistant d.A. From Ramsey county . the usual gang . Mr. janz , I 'm bill Smith with the NTSB . I 'm Raymond leacock . I represent Mr. Janz . is this a formal deposition ? not yet . I 'm sitting in on this . bill , meet Ian carpenter . he 's with the air traffic controllers organization . Mr. Janz , I know this is hard for you . I want to hear what you saw and what your actions were . we were handling 40 flights , three of us . plus the private planes . the screen was so crowded . had a god damn headache . I was tired . 35 was coming in from the east . no , from the west . and 880 was coming in . was that the 747 , don ? I looked away for a moment ... some other situation . and when I looked back ... they 'd changed places . oh ... I told 35 to turn . they were close , man . and then the numbers switched ... and you couldn 't tell them apart anymore . somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . that DC-10 was pretty public . it spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate . they don 't want people gawking at their , uh ... what did they call that crash in Florida ? involuntary conversion . they sure are busting their asses on this one . they even got the ticket agents serving coffee . Mr. Keane . where does this go ? did I tell you you could touch that ? just put that down ! hey ! how about some coffee ? hey , wait ! she likes you . what did I do ? could it be your breath ? I thought you always got that reaction . gentlemen , they 're ready to play the cockpit tapes . Minneapolis , we are currently heading ... TUA 35 , turn to heading ... [ static ] say again , Minneapolis . Jesus ! Down ! oh , my god . down ! Go down ! [ crash ] my god ! We hit them ! we hit them ! Minneapolis , this is TUA 35 declaring an emergency . we hit another aircraft . looked like a 10 . three and four shutting down . we are going down . how much of the wing is gone ? Ron , see what 's left . right . would you like some coffee , Mr. Smith ? damn ! I 'm listening ... is there anyplace to land ? can you rewind that a little ? still going down . is there anyplace to land ? just look for a flat place ... anything . they 're all dead ! what 's he talking about ? sit down , Ron ! they 're dead , all of them . [ muffled ] They 're burned up ! Jesus ! We 're going to hit ! [ crash ] [ silence ] was that Kennedy shouting ? yeah . Rockwell couldn 't understand him . run that last part through again . I 'll see if I can clean it up a bit for you . just look for a flat place ... anything . they 're all dead ! what 's he talking about ? Sit down , Ron ! they 're dead , all of them . they 're burned up ! burned up ? they were going to be . they might as well have been dead already . yeah , but it doesn 't make sense . he 'd make sense at a time like that ? no , not like that . ok . How about the pilots ? they 're the first on the scene of the accident . how many crash tapes have you heard ? god . Too many . how many times do you hear a man come apart like that ? ok , but it 's got to happen sometime . he goes back there , sees all those people who will die . it 's too much for him . obviously , they hadn 't burned up yet . what about if ... Maybe there was a fire in the cabin . maybe they were burned up already . that won 't work . the fuselage was unaffected by fire until after impact . he just broke under the strain . get me a transcript of that tape . Roger , set up a press conference for tonight . let 's go see what the dead have to say about it . is this gym the biggest place they could find ? bill , I 've got something interesting for you . these are pretty good bodies here . next door , we got stuff from the DC-10 , which is mostly pieces . next of kin will have to look at personal effects mostly . not many faces to show them . then the FBI takes over . we 'll be lucky to tag 60 % from fingerprints and dental charts . not enough hands , not enough heads . they died of trauma , dismemberment , burns , the usual . we got to get some trucks ... they 're on their way . we only got this place for two days . the trucks will be here . I want you to see this . two kinds of watches ... Mechanicals and digitals . these digitals didn 't do so good . mostly , they 're blank . heat wiped them out . but we did find this . yeah . So what ? take a closer look . it 's going backwards . this better not be a joke . it 's not . somebody had a gag watch . well , we thought of that . look at this . good evening . you all have copies of the prepared statement . I 'm William Smith , investigator in charge . I 'll try to answer your questions , but I warn you , we don 't know much more than is in that statement . who wants to go first ? can you confirm rumors of a computer error being the cause of this crash ? that 's being looked at . when can we talk to the controller ? you 'll have to ask the man 's lawyer . you 're on record as issuing a harsh indictment of the faa for failing to require anticollision devices on all commercial and private aircraft , even though they 've been available for over a decade . would you care to comment ? Dr. Mayer , do you know what caused this crash ? one of Newton 's laws , the one about gravity . can I have an interview , doctor ? I have to ask questions of my own . would you care to reply to Mr. carpenter 's charge ? no reply at this time . Next question . I 'm Dr. Arnold Mayer , professor of physics at the university . I remember you . thank you . my question has nothing to do with overloaded computers or negligent air traffic controllers . that should be refreshing . I doubt it . what unusual facts have you developed so far in your investigation ? I 'm not sure I know what you mean . were there any unexplained observations ? is there any indication this crash was caused by something less obvious than a computer overload ? none at all . Of course , every crash is unique . yet they share common factors . there are things you do and do not expect to find . is the cockpit voice recording unusual ? I can 't comment on that . It 's confidential . relevant portions will be released soon . you can listen for yourself . all right . But is there anything else odd ? have you found any unusual item in the wreckage , any discrepancies in the time sequence of the crash ? [ coughs ] I don 't know what you 're driving at . I can 't be more plain without sounding foolish . I 'm looking for the inexplicable . I usually find it . somebody made a mistake , and a lot of people died . soon we 'll be able to tell you what went wrong . there 's no mystery about it . then I salute you . I 'll read your report with interest . all TUA personnel , please check with your supervisor for shift changes . is there anything else you need tonight ? I want the salvage team to work through the night . you got it . better keep crew at the hangar , too . all right . It 's done . my secretary managed to get you a room at the marriott . tom , you 're staying at the holiday inn . privilege of rank , I guess . they got a beauty pageant there tonight ... miss I-94 . I hear the bar 's pretty wild . well , I 'm out of here . thanks , Roger . your people did a great job . our usual service . all right . Well , I 'll see you tomorrow . yeah . Los Angeles passenger Mr. George Kellerman , please pick up the white courtesy telephone . Mr. George Kellerman to the white courtesy telephone . I keep running into you . if you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . thought I 'd be sick . you get used to it after a while . [ clank ] excuse me . well , we could be stuck here for hours . maybe we 'd better get acquainted . I 'm Louise Baltimore , and you 're bill Smith . how long is it since you slept ? do I look that bad ? I didn 't say bad . Just tired . it 's got to be 30 , 35 hours , but who needs sleep ? maybe we could go have coff ... dinner and a few drinks . That 'd be nifty . am I moving too fast for you ? I can move fast , too . let 's go . you should be careful , picking up strange women . you never know where it might lead . oh . taxi ! we could take my car . what kind of car do you drive ? what kind ? that 's mine . you smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before . it took me over a year to quit . you don 't believe me ? this is my last cigarette . was it that good ? you were the best thing in a thousand years , bill . I was , wasn 't I ? I was stunned . why ? it 's been so long since I 've ... enjoyed myself ... let alone been swept away . do you believe in fate ? I will if you will . I think it was fate that brought us together . you may be right . I want to spend more time with you . I 'd like that . we 'll have all day tomorrow . we 'll have all tomorrow night , anyway . this job is killing you , bill . you need to take a rest . take it with me . the first rule is , never go to bed with anybody crazier than yourself . I don 't know if you 're crazier , but you 're in the top 10 on my weird list . if you knew me better ... I 'd be number one . [ coughs ] yes , I 'd like to cancel the 6 : 30 wake-up . yes . damn it . They were supposed to call me . well , they can 't start till you get there . bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? sure I remember . maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . this job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . why not ? the world won 't come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years . I got one coming . in one week , I 'll have this investigation started . I can hand it over to someone else . then I 'll take a long look at my life . maybe we can go away somewhere together . anyway , we 've got tonight . I may not be here tonight . we 'll talk about it tonight . Louise ? Louise ? as to systems surrounding engine number four , which was sheared off in the collision , let 's consider the fuel feed first . you 'll find that on page 19 of the computer print-out . everybody got that ? you will see there was a momentary surge when fuel line number four was severed along with 25 feet of wing tip . [ telephone rings ] Smith . Julie , thanks for calling back . no , it has nothing to do with the investigation . I can 't understand it . she was wearing a t.U. Outfit . that 's right , Baltimore , like the city . first name , Louise . I guess I made a mistake , then . thanks , Julie . it looks like the captain had little control . night , fellas . good night . we 're locking up , Mr. Smith . what 's that ? there 's a guard on that door . knock when you want to go . I 'll do that . Good night . hell of a mess , huh ? one hell of a mess . good night . it 's Smith , isn 't it ? I 'm not sure . looks like the pictures I saw . is he dead ? stunned . god damn it . Where 's the stunner ? there . he must have been fooling with it . is he out ? he 's probably seeing and hearing everything . if he is , it 's too late . god , what else can go wrong ? let 's get the hell out . Smith , you 're going to be all right . I can 't tell you who I am , but you 're endangering a project bigger than you can imagine . forget about this , or there will be a paradox . you ... coventry , send the gate . my god , you think ... we didn 't make those planes crash . I swear it . stand by for time travelers arriving through gate . gantry b operators , prepare for arrival . we have major problems . what happened ? we got the stunner . imagine my relief . Louise , I want an explanation . our master 's voice . there was a little problem . those words will be engraved in the annals of understatement . your mother was a cash register . and she turned a tidy profit , too . Louise ... what happened ? all gate operators , report to decontamination center on shutdown . do you see that ? do you see the red blob on the time line ? that is 1989 . that 's where you just went , and there 's the mess you left behind you . it 's a god damn paradox . it 's a potential paradox . you sent me to get the stunner we lost . Here . you didn 't mention Smith was there . he 'd found it and stunned himself . he wasn 't out when we found him . He saw us . sir , I have a timequake approaching . paradox . Timequake approaching . force three . a paradox , Louise . you 've changed the past . you know we can 't change the past . it catches up with us . We change . we haven 't changed much . We 're all still dying . this place still stinks . You are still ugly . one not much bigger than that could destroy us completely . you 're supposed to scan the past . you should have known Smith was there . you 're supposed to be ready for the unexpected . you 're supposed to be the best . you and your people get the best food , the best quarters . do you realize what it costs to pamper you ? he was there . did you want me to kill him ? oh , you 'd like that . killing him would create the worst paradox imaginable . his life affects thousands of lives in an endless chain . if you break it ... you get 1,000 years of bad luck , and none of us is here anymore . all right . let 's go find out what happened . maybe we can still do something . all I 'm getting is temporal censorship . scan past it . what 's temporal censorship mean ? we can 't see where we 've been or where we 're going . we can only go back to a specific moment once , and never to that same moment again . too bad . If we could ... you 'll get used to it after more missions . there he is , in the shadow . use rapid scan until he moves . Louise ! he knows my name . you probably dropped your calling card . Louise ! I didn 't mention my name . neither did anyone else . how does he know my name ? he 's got the initiator . had Smith met me before ? how else would he know your name ? I 've never been to that era . should I spell it out for you ? give it a try . in Smith 's time , he has met you before . in your time , you 've met him only once , in the hangar , which means you will go back and meet him earlier . I spoke to him , sherman . that was not a good idea . I didn 't like talking to him , sherman . you were not helping him . what 's that supposed to mean ? this seems to be my day for spelling out the obvious . I suppose I should not complain . come on , you old fraud , prep me for the 1963 flight . the ' 63 mission will proceed to stage one . the ' 63 mission will proceed to stage one . you did not smoke enough , Louise . give it to me straight , doc . no new degeneration . the levels of complex hydrocarbons in your blood are depressed due to breathing the primordial atmosphere of the 20th century . they think their air 's awful . they ain 't seen nothin ' yet . maybe I should replace those kidneys . maybe a little kick , get the old blood moving . speed kills , my dear . uniforms and hair for look-alikes will proceed to stage two . uniforms and hair for look-alikes will proceed to stage two . sometimes I think you want me to live forever . explain it to me . that 's what you 're built for . think I know what 's happening in my head ? hardly . all right . On a normal mission , when you are taking people who are about to die off doomed airplanes , you do not mind treating them roughly . All done . it 's because I 'm helping them . obviously without you , those people would be dead , so you can function without remorse . but with Smith , it was different . I don 't think I want to hear any more . how 's the little featherhead today ? Louise loves you , Orville . She does . Polly want a chemical-free sterilized cracker ? I should take you to 1963 . you could fly . would you like that ? Huh ? would you like that ? you left Smith helpless and confused , so there was pain in you . all right , I felt sorry for the bastard , but I 'd have shot him if it would straighten things out . as coventry said , you did not have that choice . what choices do I have ? you say I have to go back because he met me before . what if I don 't go back ? what happens to the universe ? you must go back . where 's my free will ? did you lose it ? I will look around for it . this is awful . you think that 's bad ? Take a look at this . we located the 1963 crash while you were away . it 's likely you will go tomorrow . how are you on the idiom and history ? I know it . who was the U.S. president ? Johnson . no , wait , uh ... he was assassinated by ... vito corleone ? Louise . we 've talked about quarks and antineutrinos , but what about people ? it 's quite a step from demonstrating that subatomic particles can travel backward through time to saying that people can . what would be the result of people traveling in time ? for one thing , paradoxes become possible . say you build a time machine , go back , and murder your father when he was 10 . that means you were never born . so how did you build a time machine ? it 's the possibility of paradoxes that make most people rule out time travel by human beings . still , why not ? if you were careful , you could do it . you would not go back to kill Adolf Hitler , much as you might like to , because it would change history . a time traveler would have to be careful , but he could do a surprising number of things . he could observe , for one . he could find out who was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas . he will know what we can only guess ... that we are destroying our planet by complacency . he will have to live with our legacy of pollution and acid rain . our negligence today is producing a world in which our children 's children will be barren and the human race heading towards extinction . he could also take things , providing they wouldn 't be missed ... water from the pacific ocean , stones from the Grand Canyon . this may sound pointless , but sometimes very small differences can be crucial . the difference between a dead man and a man who 's alive can be very small . what about a man who is about to die , a man no one will ever see alive again ? stage three alert . all sections , go . this is the hard part about looking for time travelers . they don 't want to be found . you must look for them in places where no one is , or where there are people no one will ever see alive again . all personnel , stand by for departure . go ! go ! [ bell rings ] ah . aah ! gate attendants , pick up new arrival . pick up new arrival . good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . this is your captain speaking . we are cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour . if you look out the right side through the clouds , you can see the finger lakes . our expected time of arrival is on schedule at 4 : 30 . so sit back and relax and enjoy the flight . send the others . everything 's nice and quiet . Keep it that way . gantry operators , prepare for arrival . extreme radiation danger . may I get you a pillow ? sure . prepare holding pens for arriving passengers . I 'm through up here . What 's up ? there 's a guy acting funny . he 's watching us too close . get up ! aah ! oh , my god ! take me to see the captain . sir , you can 't shoot that . if you depressurize the cabin , you 'll kill us all . nobody gets hurt if I see the captain . [ gunshot ] aah ! you stinking son of a bitch . get in there and cork the crew . keep the flight plan steady . riot squad , fast and dirty . this one 's falling apart . did ... did that man shoot her ? don 't worry , honey . It 'll be all right . when she fell ... I want you to sleep now . attention . Attention . initiation phase has commenced . all recovery team personnel , stand by . '63 flight in force field . holding . all systems to gate . ladies and gentlemen , please remain in your seats . ladies and gentlemen , please move toward the rear exit door . please step onto the ramp . walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . let 's get you out of here . that 's the survivor . Help me with Susan . please step onto the ramp . walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . you will be taken to a safety area . please step onto the ramp . walk quickly to the bottom and follow instructions . you will be taken to a safety area . please step onto the ramp . all substitute bodies will be placed strictly according to the passenger list . passengers now in transit . prepare to activate holding pen force fields . now we know a hijacker caused this crash . we know there was a survivor . we know when it crashed . we just have to duplicate it . I stopped it . I stopped the bullet . you saved us all , kid . hang in there . You 'll be all right . he fired his gun in the cockpit . have djakarta attach a 5-k bomb to the windscreen . that should duplicate the effect . I lost it . what , Susan ? what did you lose ? stun . stunner . I lost the stunner . look out . stop it ! Hold the gate ! stop her ! Baltimore , get out of there ! no time , Louise ! No time ! Louise , there 's a bomb ! one of my team was shot . in the confusion , a stunner was lost . it was too late to get it . preventing a paradox is more important than individual lives . blame is secondary at this point . the first stunner you lost in 1989 ended up in bill Smith 's possession . he knows what it can do . then you went back to 1963 and lost another stunner . the computers estimate it wound up in Arnold Mayer 's possession . if he learns what it does , he might learn how it works . the council has decided to risk another mission to 1989 . you 'll meet Smith the day before you saw him in the hangar . prevent him from going to that hangar the next night . since he knew your name when he saw you , he must have met you previously . therefore , you did go back . must go back . I can 't get away from you . I would be a poor personal robot if you could . I lost a good girl on that plane . what was the council 's epitaph for her ? preventing a paradox is more important than individual lives . Susan knew that . She accepted it . I just ... I couldn 't leave her . it is not necessary to destroy your soul in this job , Louise , but a certain amount of violence will be done to it . you made the wrong choice . it is easy for them to make cold choices , Louise . they are hardly human anymore . am I so different ? we 're all dying . they 're just a little further along . you are different . you have feelings . they want me to go back . you have to go back . he must be kept out of that hangar . this isn 't a job for me , sherman . you want somebody 's head bashed , I 'm your girl . you will have to learn new methods . you can do it . I know you can . then let 's go do it . standard metal fatigue . somebody 's got these guys working harder and faster than I 've ever seen . that DC-10 was pretty public . it spread itself over a field half a mile from the interstate . what did they call that crash in Florida ? involuntary conversion . they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off . they 're busting their asses on this . take this coffee over there . they even got the ticket agents serving coffee . put that down ! did I tell you you could touch that ? hey . how about some coffee ? what a long night ahead of us . hey , wait a minute . declaring an emergency ! we hit another aircraft ! looked like a 10 . three and four shutting down . we are going down ! Repeat ! Going down ! how much of the wing is gone ? Ron , see what 's left ! some coffee , Mr. Smith ? damn it ! I 'm listening ... still going down . is there anyplace to land ? [ tape player is turned off ] sherman , he 's seen me again . I think he 's interested . What next ? ahem . what now , sherman ? think of something . take him to dinner . someplace romantic . how do I do that ? pick him up , my dear . how ? drop your hankie . Wiggle your behind . you 're the woman , Louise . you figure it out . just be subtle . Louise is about as subtle as a lead pipe . thanks . it should be appropriate to the era as well as stimulating to the contemporary male . sorry about the high heels . I keep running into you . if you 're not running away . I had to get out of that hangar . I thought I 'd be sick . you get used to it . oh ! excuse me . well , we could be stuck here for hours . maybe we 'd better get acquainted . oh ! taxi ! we could take my car . what kind of car do you drive ? what kind ? that 's mine . why don 't you get in ? you got the keys ? keys ? [ car starts ] whoa ! the tower clear you for that takeoff ? so , do you know Minneapolis ? naw . I 've only been here ... watch it ! a couple of times . I know a good place . anyplace is fine . something wrong ? just watch ... Jesus ! [ horn honking ] you really drive this thing . are we almost there ? another two minutes at this velocity . how long you had this car ? oh , ah ... Forever . you must be the luckiest woman in the world . [ honk honk ] hey ! What are you doing ? idiot ! you all right ? I feel like I should kiss the ground . wow ! can 't get that anymore . I 'll have another one . forget the water . can 't get it anymore ? it 's old , but it 's not that old . oh , I mean , I can 't usually afford ... are you ready to order ? bill , would you order for me ? I can never decide . ok . The sole and a tossed salad and Italian dressing . that 's the first time I 've ordered for a girl since after the senior prom in high school . did I act improperly ? no . no . It 's just ... Haven 't you ever heard of women 's lib ? suffragette movement , 19th amendment , Rosie the riveter , bra burning , Gloria steinem , e.R.A. , battle of the sexes . who won ? I think it 's still being fought . we might call a truce for tonight . I 'd like that . who won ? you have a strange sense of humor . sometimes it 's like you grew up in a foreign country . I did . I grew up abroad , overseas . whereabouts ? France . I 'm from France . My father was posted there . he was a warrior . soldier ? that 's right . A soldier . well , to France , then . excuse me . your table 's ready for you now . that 's a real habit you got . what habit is that ? I 've never seen anyone eat and smoke at the same time . where did it go ? if you hear someone scream , that 's probably where it is . Louise , you got to quit . that tobacco 's ruining your brain . so you never remarried , and you don 't have a girlfriend ? isn 't that a little unusual ? is it ? I guess so . I don 't know . Sometimes I wish i ... what ? done things differently , I guess . the job always came first . I know what you mean . that 's how I feel about my job . yours doesn 't take you away in the middle of the night and keep you gone a couple of months . when I got back , my girl had usually gone . maybe you didn 't find the right girl . maybe . tom says I 'm burning out . whatever , I just gave up looking . took a lot of cold showers . you find it difficult to talk about yourself . that 's all I 've been doing . well , you 're right . I can 't ... open up emotionally ? that 's it . I 'm no good at ... expressing yourself ? I couldn 't have said it better myself . what about you ? why aren 't you married ? I can 't have any children . I 'm sorry . but that 's not the only reason to get married . would be for me . I 'd like to get out of here . where are you staying ? I can drive you there . for a minute , I forgot . I haven 't even seen the room . I was going to ask you if it 's nice . you can come up and take a look . it is nice . at least they delivered my luggage . " compliments of the management . " that 's real nice . that is nice . would you like an apple ? what 's so funny ? I don 't know . you just seem to do everything a little different from everyone else . is that bad ? I don 't think so . let 's find out . this may not have been such a good idea . why not ? you don 't find me attractive ? no . It 's not that . It 's just ... wait . try it again . please . I really want this to work . I really need this to work . let me get the light . the hell with the light . there 's a spare toothbrush in there , if that 's what you 're looking for . I thought you were sleeping . I think I was . come here . you smoke too much . I 'll quit tomorrow . just like that , huh ? I 've heard that story before . took me over a year to quit . you don 't believe me ? this is my last cigarette . damn it ! They were supposed to call me . well , they can 't start till you get there . bill , you remember we were talking about fate ? sure I remember . maybe that 's why they didn 't call you . are you listening to me ? I don 't get it . this job is wearing you down . I know it is . I can 't just walk away from it , Louise . why not ? the world 's not going to come to an end if you just walk away . I haven 't had a vacation in six years . I got one coming . in one week , I 'll have this investigation started , and I can hand it over to someone else . then I 'll take a long look at my life . maybe we can go away somewhere together . anyway , we got tonight . I may not be here tonight . stay with me . I can 't . we 'll talk about it tonight . Sherman , send the gate . Louise ? gate operation terminated . all controls to zero . hmm . he 'll never miss it . what happened ? did you stop him ? Sherman , get my uniform . paradox ! Timequake approaching ! force seven . I have to talk to the council . there isn 't much time ! here 's what happened after I left . going over every single piece of wreckage in this hangar . identify it . Tag it . you don 't know what something is , bring it to me . what are we looking for ? I 'll know when I see it . we 'll reassemble the 747 from the ground up . bill , are you sure ? that 's all . he 's forgotten all about what really caused the crash . now he 's looking for the stunner ... and for me . we 're wasting time , bill . you can 't learn anything from this . rebuild it ... every inch of it , day and night . I 'll approve the overtime . the boss is on the phone from Washington . tell him I 'll call him back . he says get back there or you 'll be fired . well , that sounds fairly urgent . want me to go with you ? being around me might not be good for your career . he 's doing his job badly now . it had to lead to conflict with his superiors . bill , I 've always backed you because you were a good investigator . I let you run with this even if I couldn 't see the reason , but you 've turned up nothing new . what do you expect to find ? if I knew , I wouldn 't have to look so hard . this crash has been crazy from the start ... like the watches that ran backwards . you said that wasn 't important . I didn 't think so . Now I do . and the cockpit tape ... the engineers screaming that they 're all dead and burned . was it computer error or not ? yeah . soon as we get your report saying that , we can recommend getting new computers . that 's a big appropriation , and congress is ready to spend the money . something happened ... In the hangar . I found something . I think it knocked me out . they came and took it from me . and now they 're watching me . I can feel it . they can go anywhere ... look anywhere . there was this ... Girl . now he 'll go see Dr. Mayer . Dr. Mayer doesn 't have the answers , but he has one of these . it 's the stunner Susan lost in 1963 . Smith has the initiator . you put them together , and it spells paradox . come in , Mr. Smith . been expecting you . that 's it . it 's all temporal censorship from there . that means I will go back . I can stop the paradox if I leave now . the watches , the cockpit voice recording ... that could be important , but you say she didn 't know you . she said I looked like my pictures . then she hadn 't met you yet . I told you , we spent the night together . it was unforgettable . you 're missing the point . she finds you in the hangar on the night of the 5th . she returns to wherever she 's from . then , for reasons of her own , she returns to the 4th and meets you for the first time from her point of view . she 's traveling in time . there has to be another answer . it 's time I showed you something . I 've been working on a puzzle for 25 years . you may be the missing piece . that 's it ! Where 'd you get it ? what is it ? it 's some kind of weapon . all systems green . quadrants interlock . all systems go . two minutes . Baltimore , solo , 1989 . two minutes . all I want to do is find her . I don 't care about anything else . bill , I think you 'll see her again . how do you know so much about her ? because of this object . it 's very important . I 've run tests over the years . I still don 't know what it 's made of . we can 't make one in the 20th century . where 'd you get it ? in the wreckage of a 707 that crashed in upstate New York in 1963 . I was on that plane . that can 't be . the only survivor was a boy named ... William Collins . my mother remarried , and I took the name . this is incredible . then you must ... what do you remember ? I don 't think about it much . you must remember something . I don 't remember the crash at all . before that ... people were shouting . somebody got shot . they found a gun with one shot fired . it was a mental patient , a hijacker . there was this lady . it was her . I remember it now . she told me everything would be all right . she knew you 'd survive . why didn 't she die in the crash ? she got off , but left this . she 'll want it back . after 25 years ? Our time . in her time , she just lost it yesterday . this shouldn 't be here . we 're living in her past . if she changes her past , creates a paradox , then her world is destroyed . we 'll see more of Louise Baltimore . laser beams , prepare for countdown . time tones intimate at 6 seconds . 5 , 4 ... I may not make it back . you will be back . all systems green . 30 seconds . Baltimore , solo , 1989 . 30 seconds . this came off mine . you know too much . I don 't have much time , but I 'll answer questions . doctor , I 'll have to take that . you take people off planes just before they crash . we replace what we take with dead bodies . I 'm glad you came back . but the relatives identify them . they identify the wrong people . we duplicate them ... fingerprints , dental records . we 're very good at what we do . then you are from the future . about 1,000 years . it must be incredible . it must be horrible . it 's awful . we 're all dying . we can make the bodies , but not the souls . we can 't have children anymore . we steal people from the past to send them somewhere else to start over ... to give them a second chance . I have to take that stunner back with me , Dr. Mayer . it could cause a paradox . I 'm going with you . you can 't , bill . Haven 't you heard anything I 've said ? you said you were dying . So am I. the whole race is dying , all of humanity . we 're all going to die . what matters is now ... this moment . I can 't take anything with me that 'll be missed . no one 's going to miss me . the stunner , Dr. Mayer . that 's what I came for . I knew I was right . no ! he 's dead . the paradox has happened . I got to get out of here . take me with you . Sherman , send the gate . watch that first step . It 's a killer . timequake . force infinity . paradox . timequake . Force infinity . Mr. Smith , I presume . come on . Mayer 's work would have changed history . he wasn 't supposed to die for six years . I tried to stop him . it 's all over . the paradox is here . if you had left things alone , this wouldn 't have happened . I did what I had to do . our world is at an end . all evidence of our existence will be washed away . we must attempt to send those we have saved into a distant future beyond the gate . coventry ... reverse the gate . get out ! get out ! Everybody get out ! go , Louise . get him out of here . open the holding pens ! release everyone and send them to the gate . you will awake now . remain calm . Remain calm . all right ! Come on ! Let 's go ! proceed to the gate as quickly as possible . proceed in single file to the main terminal . remain calm . do not be afraid . Do not be afraid . no harm will come to you . follow directions . walk toward the light and step into the light . move along . move along ! everything 's all right . please remain calm . single file . Walk into the light . you 'll be all right . Keep moving . single file . Walk into the light . walk toward the light and step into the light . aah ! our work is done . I move we adjourn . seconded . just keep moving . walk through the light . walk into the light . time to go , bill . the gate will be destroyed in two minutes . what happens when the gate 's gone ? like a nuclear bomb . step through , bill . together . none of us can go . only you . then I 'm not going either . take a chance , Louise . go with him . you are going to have his child . the gate will be destroyed in one minute . Sherman , come with us . there is no place for me where you are going . go ! now ! this is not the end . this is not the beginning of the end . it is the end of the beginning .

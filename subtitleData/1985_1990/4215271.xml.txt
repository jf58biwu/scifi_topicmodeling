It doesn 't even matter . All that matters now is survival . In this desolate world ... there 's little hope . Filled with disease and pollution ... it is unfit for human life . Food is scarce . And what little there is is grabbed by bands of murdering raiders ... led by a madmen determined to destroy the last good human beings . This village is mine ! I don 't know if I will survive this madness ... or if anyone will ever know of my struggles . All I know is ... I must try . Let 's burn it down ! Come on , bring it over here ! Come on , get up there ! I want this place burned to the ground ! No one , no one survives ! What are you doing ? I thought I saw somebody . Come on , let 's go . No , please . Don 't go . I 'm wounded . Please , help me . I sure hope you 're a doctor . How long have you been here ? Two , maybe three days . I don 't remember anymore . It should be better tomorrow . You 'll need that . I don 't suppose you wanna share any of that , would you ? My name 's Anderson . What 's yours ? I just thought that since we 'll be spending the night together - Will you just shut up ! Whatever you say . You 're quite a cook . Harmony . What ? Harmony . My name is Harmony . That 's a very pretty name . What 's that supposed to mean ? Nothing . Just that . It 's pretty . Hey ! Look at the cave ! Check it out . Forget it , go back to camp . I 'm leaving . I need food and water . Mind if I tag along for awhile ? I 'm not too fond of the accomodations here . I travel alone . I don 't need a cripple to slow me down . I just thought that maybe you 'd like some company . I go alone ! Most loners don 't survive . I do . Yeah , I bet you do . Hey ! Thanks for the food . Alright . If you can keep up you can come along . But you have to take care of yourself . Well now , that 's the best offer I 've had all day . Jesus . It 's an attack group . They must be going after another village . Let 's go . We 're gonna be real careful now between us and where we 're going . Come on . What the hell are you doing here ? I lost Anderson . He got away . How many men did you lose ? It was dark out there . We got jumped by surprise . He took all of you ? No way man , he had a whole bunch of guys - Don 't lie to me , asshole ! Like I said , it was dark , I couldn 't tell . One guy ... Against how many ? Nine ! Nine ... Bad . Real bad . God damn you ! I don 't want excuses , I want Anderson ! And you gotta ... Go take some men ! I don 't care if you take the whole camp . Bring him to me . Now get out . Demister 's tracking him right now . Get out ! One of these days I 'm gonna cut his balls off and feed em to the dogs . You okay ? A little weak . This climbing isn 't helping . Don 't worry , I won 't slow you down . Don 't touch me ! Don 't you ever touch me ! Relax for Christ 's sake . I just slipped . And please , put that thing down . Never touch me . No way , hot shot . I wouldn 't think of it . Hold it right there . Now turn around real slow-like . You like at ya . Been following ya all morning . Well well , Demister . So Slater finally let you out of your cage . Slater 's gonna be mighty happy to see you Anderson . Mighty happy . You can drop that weapon too . Thought you 'd get away , did you . But I got you . Don 't move ! Are you hurt ? I 'm okay . She your woman ? I 'm nobody 's woman ! You try one more dumb thing like that , cunt , and it will be your end . You got it ? Freak . Pig . What did you say . I can 't hear you . Maybe your mouth needs a little help . You want some of this ? You 're gonna have to beg for it . Demister 's the name . You call me that . And you better learn to like me . 'cause we got a long road ahead . Move . Move . You and me are gonna have a good time tonight . Slut . You can put your bag down right there . What now , halfwit ? Over by that tree . Move . Move . Get your hands behind that tree . You never should have burned Slater 's face . Slater 's more deranged than you are . I knew I should have finished what I started . Slater 's a survivor . Only the strong have a plce now . Not chicken shits like you . You see , Anderson . We don 't like your ideas . This good shit about saving the world making it better . Look around you ! This place is nothing but a fucking garbage dump . Where do you think you 're going ? Demister ! Shut up , shit head . You listen to me . You 're for me . You think I 'm gonna let Anderson have you ? It 's my turn now bitch ! [ [ EMPTY ] ] Now , that 's right . Feels sharp doesn 't it ? You keep that up and ... I 'm gonna have to carve you up a little . I could always slit it open . Get away from her ! What 's the matter , Anderson ? You want a turn ? Harmony . He 's dead . Are you okay ? Shut up ! You got me into this . I should have known better . Where the hell are you going ? Hey for Christ 's sake , cut me loose . You 're not gonna leave me here like this . You can work your way loose in a couple of hours . By then I 'll be gone . Long gone . Harmony , use your head . Cut me loose . With that bike over there ... we can both get far from here . I could help you . Like you helped me get into this ? [ [ EMPTY ] ] Look , I can take you wherever you wanna go . I go nowhere with you . What were you doing with a scum like this . I 'm not with them . I wanted to organize the raiders . I tried to get them to rebuild But it fell apart . And now they all follow a madman called Slater . You think there 's anything better ? You 're a fool . There 's something better . What ? There 's this place I know of . A group of people that banded together . They built something new out of what was left . You know where it is ? No . Not exactly . But I know I van find it . I don 't need anybody . I can take care of myself . I 'm sure you can . Look . These ropes are cutting my wrists . Would you mind ? You really know this place ? If you cut me loose we can find it together . You better not be lying . Well , that 's it . We 're out of alcohol , no more riding . Shit . Our water supply is low too . I guess we 'll have - Look . Plague . Poor bastards . Do you think they have any water ? If they do we couldn 't use it . Come on , let 's go . You think there 's any game around here ? I haven 't seen any signs of any . Are you okay ? Yeah . This looks like it 's been used lately . It has . There 's something over there . Yeah , I see it . Come on , let 's go . No ! Could be dangerous . We need food . Nobody gives food away . You never can tell . You could get shot . I 'll be careful . Someone 's home . Hold your fire . We mean you no harm . Move closer where I can see you . That 's far enough . You and your trusting . You put your hands up . What do you want ? All we need isn a little food . If you can spare any . Food comes hard these days . Who are you ? Just two people running from the raiders . False snakes . Is that your woman ? No . We 're just travelling together . Okay . Come in . But don 't try to do anything funny . I have a real itchy trigger finger . We wouldn 't think of it . Put your weapons right there . This is very kind of you . We appreciate it . Sit down . On the bench . Don you have an outhouse I can use ? Somewhere outside . But be back in three minutes . Don 't you worry . I 'll be right back . I mean three minutes . That 's a good looking woman . Very good looking woman . Well well , look what I found me . You are not very polite . I 'm just trying to be friendly . The food ... on the table . Looks good . This looks like real meat stew . What 's in it ? Deer meat . My friends and I got a very nice deer a while back . Harmony , what are you doing ? You better go lookn at the barn . Why , what 's out there ? That 's not deer meat . What are you talking about ? It 's human , that is human meat . Shed 's full of dead people . Still want that stew ? . Come on , we better hurry . The others will be back soon . Others ? What makes you think there are others ? Trust me , there are others . I 'll get you . I hope you know that . You won 't live to see it . Harmony ! He 's not worth it . What 's the matter , girl ? No guts ? Harmony , that 's something the raiders would do . Don 't . You 're lucky . You creeps . You creeps . I 'll get you ! We should have killed the old bastard . Why ? The others will follow us just as fast . That kinda scum should be wiped out . Harmony , you can 't change the world by killing everybody . You only kill somebody when you have to . Sssh . Not a sound . Something 's coming . Two I think . Listen . Hey . They go that way . I see that . Must be close , trail 's fresh . We got them . Shut up . You want them to hear us ? Which way do you think they went ? If I 'd known that we 'd be doing it . We never should have to kill Buck . I don 't wanna hear any more about that dog . He ate too much , there wasn 't enough for us . Shame . I 'm sorry . Can I go first when we get the girl ? Beautiful girl . We 'll worry about that when we find em . See if you can pick up their trail . That dummy . I wish ma wouldn 't have stopped pa from grounding him . Harmony . I heard something . Shut up . I see her . I got you now . Damnit . That 's not funny , I could have killed you . Don 't do that again . What ? You scared the shit out of me . And quit trying to do everything by yourself . If you don 't like it you can travel alone . I do what has to be done . Listen hot shot , I know what I 'm doing . Next time , I might be useful . Out here you learn to react if you want to survive . You have no time for second thoughts and I don 't answer to anyone for my actions . Harmony , that 's not the point . I just don 't want you to get hurt . You 're welcome . We 'll get it someday , won 't we ? What ? The Plague . Don 't worry . If you were gonna get it you would have gotten it by now . I told you never to touch me . I was trying to help you . I don 't need your help . We all need help these days . Look , it 's nothing against you . I just can 't stand to be touched , that 's all . Why not ? That 's a stupid-ass question . Every man I 've ever come across has either tried to kill me ... or rape you ? I haven 't . I 'll kill you if you try . Why is it like this ? It 'll be dark soon . Come on , let 's move . Wait . Think they 're stalking us ? I think we better find some high ground to spend the night . Raiders . That 's Purvis , one of Slater 's prime maniacs . He 's the one over there . Move up the side of that hill . Go get up . I want them now . Go tell em to move . Come on , we 're going down . Are you crazy ? We gotta grab one of those bikes . It 's our only chance to get away from hre . Fire ! Harmony . Harmony , come on . There 's nothing we can do . Let 's go . We gotta move fast while the fighting 's still going on . Leave it , let 's run . No , they 'll catch us . One of them is getting away . He 's got one of our bikes . Son of a bitch , it 's that fucking Anderson . Get on the bike . I want him , now ! They 're catching up ! I can see that . Can 't you make this thing go any faster ? What do you think I 'm doing ? What now ? Look over there . Where the hell did they come from ? We 're in deep shit . It 's okay , no problem . I 've got it . Are you fucking crazy ? No problem ? Okay , you two go that way . You follow . Where the hell are you going ? Go ! Go ! What the hell are you doing ? I tried to get up there , then I fell . Give them a fucking hand will you . Asshole . You know , brother , you stink . [ [ EMPTY ] ] You 're not gonna be needing that fuel , Anderson . Get off , move slow . I 'll gibve you this : you 're one tough bastard to catch . Well , whaddaya know . Purvis . You son of a gun , were you looking for me ? Cut the bullshit ! I got you and I 'm taking you to Slater . I don 't think we 're going anywhere together , Purvis . If I were you I 'd drop that thing . What 's the matter , heat getting to you ? This thing 's loaded . What do you take me for , stupid ? Move . Freeze ! Put your hands up , bigmouth . Now shoot that thing . You dirty bitch . Can I shoot him ? You won 't have to . Come on . Oh come on , don 't just stand there . Shoot it . You 're not gonna leave me here like this , come on . I was kidding , Anderson . I hate fucking snakes . We can take it easy for a while now . You think they 'll send anybody else after us ? You can bet on it . I was afraid you 'd say that . Stay back . Away you go . [ [ EMPTY ] ] [ [ EMPTY ] ] My lord , and my lady . Many thanks . You sure talk funny . And just who might you be ? I 'm Orland , and this is Guinevere . Well , I think you 'll be safe and well now . We gotta go . Where you headed ? South . Can I go ? Sorry , there 's no room . You 're not going to leave us here all alone . Does that thing work ? We 'll go slow for a while so you can follow us . But once we get past those hills , we gotta go . Alright ? Don 't leave us . Slow down . Hey ! Don 't leave us ! Come back ! Come on , let 's go . Hey look , we got Anderson . Well , well , well . What do we have here ? Nice . Very nice . I always did like a woman with spirit . Leave her alone Slater , I 'm the one you want . She hasn 't done anything to you . No , not yet . But she will . What are you looking at him for ? He can 't help you . Only I can . You treat me nice , and all this is yours . Gee , I don 't know how I 'd live without it . Take her. have her cleaned up . I wanna see how pretty she looks . Get her ! Get her ! I want her alive ! Harmony , look out ! Don 't let her get away . [ [ EMPTY ] ] [ [ EMPTY ] ] Pity . I had such nice plans for you . Out of my way . Take em both away . Anderson , you stinking bastard . I 'm gonna slit your throat for leaving me with that snake . I hate snakes . No . He pays my way . Take him away . Move . Guinevere . Guinevere . Now what have you got us into ? I always thought it was safer to travel alone . At least you can 't say I don 't make life exciting . What do you think they 're gonna do with us ? I was afraid you 'd ask that . Slater 's on a real rampage . I humiliated him in front of his men and maimed his face . He 's gonna have to get their respect back if he wants to stay in power . Purvis is just itching to take over . And he 's got a lot of followers . This just might be the chance he 's looking for . All in all ... Yeah , I get the picture . We 're in deep shit again . Doesn 't have to be for you . I 'm the one he wants . All you have to do is be nice , and ... I 'd rather die . I 'm sorry I got you into this . It 's my own choice . Nobody put a gun to my head . Why does he hate you so much ? I 'm a threat to him . He has to kill me . You see , when Slater came along , the men started getting greedy and restless . We had a power struggle . One day some of my men and I tried to stop him . But we were betrayed , he was waiting for us . I barely got out of there in one piece . Since then it 's been run , fight , hide . That 's when you found me . I 'm sorry I got you involved . I didn 't want you to get hurt . It 's been a long time since anyone cared about me . The time is here , Anderson . I 'm gonna take great pleasure in seeing you suffer . When are you gonna stop being a fool , Purvis ? How long are you gonna let Slater treat you like a dog ? You don 't worry about that . 'cause you ain 't gonna be here to see it . Understand ? Of course . Untie him . Well , well , Anderson . You 're gonna pay for all the trouble you 've caused . And you 're gonna pay slow . I 'm gonna have you skinned alive . You 're such a brave man , Slater , with all your goons around you . But you don 't have the guts to do your own dirty work . The trouble with you Anderson , is you live in the past . You 're trying to rebuild the old world . But what you fail to realize is the same people who made the old world also destroyed it . [ [ EMPTY ] ] No , the only way is to win . The strong will survive , Anderson . And I 'm a winner . You 're a loser . Chain the girl up . I 'm gonna show her how nice I can be . And then ... They get a turn . Get him ! I don 't know where you canme from , but your timing was perfect . Through the door . What door ? Over there . [ [ EMPTY ] ] Come on . Come on . [ [ EMPTY ] ] No , don 't , don 't . They are my friends . They are my friends . They are the ones that showed me where I could find you . Do these little devils speak ? They don 't have to , we understand each other . What 's going on ? What 's happening ? The raiders have found the door , they 're coming in . We must run . Go on , this way . Look , there they are , up there . Go down that way , down there . I got one . Which way did they go ? Look in there . Not that way , Get out. move out . Oh , shit . Can you blow it ? Can I blow it ? Find them . Come on , they gotta be around here somewhere . Hey ! Come on , let 's go ! Get to the bikes ! Get to the bikes ! Over here ! Right here ! Right there . Get off . They 're catching up . This thing 's not going fast enough ! Step on it , they 're right behind us . okay , okay ! Oh shit , what 's that ? I 'm glad they 're on our side . You and me both . Let 's get to the other side . Anderson ! I 'm gonna get you , Anderson ! There ain 't no place or hole big enough for you to hide . I am gonna find you and I am gonna kill you . Excitable type , isn 't he ? I think we 'll be safe for awhile . It 's gonna take them some time to get around there . By then who knows , we may even reach Blue Lake . I hope you find it . Aren 't you coming with us ? No . I will stay here for awhile . We 're gonna miss you . If it weren 't for you and your friends ... Well , I hope we meet again . Soon . Come on , let 's go . Oh shit , here we go again . Timing by Eazin line 28 : educated guess ? line 292 : first word spoken makes no sense , probably the guy 's name . Same with 201 and 302 . line 293 : englishj grammar isn 't good there , but the guy 's a few screws loose , so that 's still a possibility .

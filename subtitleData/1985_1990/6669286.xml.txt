 [ Man ] I 'm afraid our star reporter is going to have to disappear- - Get this joker ! ... permanently . Where does all this come from , Bryce ? The components of Carter 's mind . But he 's adding to it . [ Theora ] It 's computer-generated , whatever it is . Looks like Edison . [ Bryce ] People translated as data . - Max . - Damn it ! Two minds but with one single memory . [ Edison on TV ] The first question I want answered is just what is buried here beneath me . Does anyone really know ? And if they know , why aren 't they telling ? Because this may be a unique place . Right here may be buried tomorrow 's dead- - the dead as yet unborn . What I want to know is am I standing on the site of an epitaph for the future ? I am in a corner of the Fringes , which has become home to the thousands who have drifted here to make a precarious living- - [ Man ] Don 't look around . - ... or to build a permanent shelter . - It 's the same van . Beneath this apparently unremarkable patch of land lies a time bomb set to detonate- - Run . Run . ... or maybe tomorrow . This is Edison Carter , and I 'm looking for some answers . Answer that . Who the hell are they , Mel ? I don 't know . It 's the same pair . But we haven 't done anything . You don 't have to have done anything . Eh , Mr. Breugal ? Just as long as you 're a perfect match . [ laughing ] Keep going . Go on . [ laughing ] - There 's no way out . - Over here . - Aah ! - Uhhn ! Aah ! [ motor whirrs ] Aah ! [ screaming ] Good . [ gasping ] Dr. Mason will be pleased . She 's the very thing . [ Woman 's voice ] Nightingale 's . She 's close . I think she 's what you need . [ Man ] Miss Formby , listen to me . Your colleague Dr. Moon is adamant . This is the last transplant Mother can withstand . We may lose her body , but I will have her mind . By whatever means , you will obtain that " Max Headroom " computer regeneration process . Now , fail me , and I will finish Cheviot . I will ruin him . And you in particular know I can . [ chatter ] [ dog barking ] [ barking ] [ Edison on TV ] As my investigation continued and I found a wall of silence , the authorities didn 't want to talk about it . No one would admit anything . Penetrating the security around this story has not been easy , but now I can reveal just what is happening here . The truth will only hurt the guilty . The guilty know who they are and can hide no longer . And for the first time in years , I can now reveal the original design projections for this mysterious facility . This is what you 're sitting on . Beneath you are thousands of tons of such terrifyingly lethal material that previous generations hid them and threw away the key . So dangerous were they that they were buried beneath the ground on which this city now stands . [ Woman 's voice ] I have Chairman Ped Xing of the Zik-Zak Corporation , Mr. Cheviot . [ Edison , continuing ] ... go away . But this problem will not go away . [ speaking Japanese ] To business ! We have noticed the downward trend in ratings since blipverts work discontinued . We feel this trend is very small , Chairman . Size of chairman irrelevant . Mr. Kiyoko , please . Sir . This analysis , however , illustrates one remarkable ratings escalation . We wish to purchase this presenter for our next product array burst . Gentlemen , as our foremost client , we naturally place you in first position . Which presenter is this ? He is named Max Headroom . We will await your call , Mr. Cheviot . [ Edison , continuing ] We are one of the unlucky generations . We are the children who have been left to play in the poisonous backyard our parents decided not to tell us about . Formby . How is Bryce 's Max Headroom project progressing ? I 'm moving him as fast as possible , but he 's got real problems . Max is very- - uncooperative . Then we have a problem , Julia . Zik-Zak wants him for their new promotion today . Today ? This has been Edison Carter on Network 23 with the show that answers the questions others are afraid to ask . Good show . Terrific show . Great work . Good show . Good . You . Great show . - [ phone rings ] - Great . Look at these calls . They 're pouring in . Are you going to run a follow-up ? Already in hand , and we 're going to go all the way in show 2 . - [ computer blipping ] - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah . Strong story , Murray . Congratulations . Splendid start for your series . Thank you , sir . I think- - My feeling is we should go for a follow-up . - Really chase this one . - I 'll certainly do that . Congratulate Edison for me . Very good job . I certainly will . Thank you . It 's tough at the top . Always one step ahead . Just give me some Edison memory first . [ Max ] Edison 's first kiss . [ Bryce ] Great . Great . [ Max ] And for your d-d-data file , Bryce , that 's a girl . And there is another one ... of sorts . Having fun ? Oh , hello , Mrs. Formby . Miss . Now how ready is he ? Not very . Ah , Miss- - Miss- - Mrs. Formby . Have you seen Edison ? I want to know- - I want to know about a certain n-n-night that I can 't remember with any certainty . All I get is a headache and a fuz-z-z- - fuzzy hole in my memory- - memory ... bank . How do you feel about making Max available to a principal client ? Well , if they don 't care when he comes or goes or what he says or does , then fine . [ cheering ] - Edison . - [ Woman ] Good job . - Hi . - Hi . Congratulations . Cheviot loves the show , and he wants us to go for it . What ? The wine truck ? - Absolutely . - Oh , let 's do it . - You deserve it . - Thanks . - [ Man ] Hey , Murray . - Yeah . By the way , Max has been after you . Something about a lost memory . He is a pain . He got me at home last night at my terminal , and you can 't shut him up . I had to throw a blanket over him . He started talking to that . - Way to go , Edison . - Hey , thanks a lot . His trouble is is that he was born at the age of 27 with no past to account for it , so I keep having to explain things to him neither of us can remember . So I guess you can 't blame him for talking to the furniture . Well , a chair I can understand . Yeah , but a blanket ? Max is being difficult . I told you . And so is Zik-Zak . Let 's get Bryce on this now . But the problem- - he needs a rest to evaluate them . Bryce could tackle the problem fresh . There 's only one problem- - to maintain this network 's reputation . I 'm surprised that you , of all people , should consider anything more important than that . Ha ha ! Whoo ! [ whooping ] Damn it , Breugal . Can 't you be more discreet ? [ giggling ] Discreet meat , Dr. Mason ? Are you discreet when you dismantle her ? Doc , do you keep all the best bits ? Huh ? [ laughing ] Right type on ticket ? How often am I wrong , Mr. Mason ? - It 's possible . - But unlikely . Take your type . I know your type very well . Shall we check your type , Dr. Mason ? - [ machine whirs ] - Check him . Check him . - Check him . - Check him . - [ laughing ] - Check him . Check him . It 's a shame about her back . It was a lovely back , that . [ sigh ] The loudest sound in the universe is ... the last heartbeat . Murray . This guy just won 't take no for an answer . He insists on talking to Edison . Uh , Theora , get this , will you ? Okay . [ Murray ] Okay . Okay , party 's over . Come on , let 's get to it . Can I help you ? I have to speak to Edison Carter . I 'm afraid network policy doesn 't allow that . I can take a message . Hello ? Hello ? Hello . [ screaming ] [ gasping ] Right . Now let 's see if she 's got what we need . And quickly . - Good night , Theora . - Good night , Jack . [ car alarm blips ] Oh ! Oh ! What are you doing ? Now you call Mr. Carter , whoever he is . According to a government spokesman , - " I guess it fired- - " - [ phone rings ] " ... before clearing its holster . " The rogue cannon is also suspected- - [ ring ] ... of being responsible last week for the loss of two network TV satellites . [ ring ] Quipped the spokesman , " Maybe it just got ... bored . " [ ring ] - Edison . - Oh , hi , Theora . You still at the party ? [ Man ] Edison Carter ? Yes , this is Edison Carter . Are you alone ? Theora . Theora . Hello . Hello ? Look , I 'll have to key in his number . Do it . - Aah ! - [ grunt ] Edison ! - You okay ? - Yes , I 'm okay . That 's more than I can say for him . You did the wrong thing , friend . Theora hates violence . Don 't push it . You can have it now , or you can have it right . I can 't work faster . Edie , how is she holding up ? No problem . She 's a fine specimen . I just hope the old lady is worth the waste . Now , just what did you intend to do with this ? Nothing . It 's not loaded . I wouldn 't have harmed her . Oh , really ? I 'm sorry . I had to get to Mr. Carter . We 're not from the city . We don 't know people . The Metrocops never would have listened to me . Anyway , I can 't afford to buy law . - Who 's we ? - Me and Rayna . We 're from the river . We come in town to sell blood at the body bank . She 's got a rare group , and they pay well . We were heading home . They just took her . Okay . Take it easy . Now what happened out there ? There 's this ... story- - rumor . It 's all it is . People are disappearing from the Fringes . It 's always a van . These two freaks . They 're stealing people , Mr. Carter . Stealing bodies . It 's organized , it 's vicious . it 's always girls . They 've got Rayna . Give me another reaction . Hello , Bryce . Theora Jones here . Uh-huh . Hello , Miss Jones . Listen , Bryce , I 'd like clearance and link to the personality templates on the Diogenes program , please . Uh , of course . It 's 0 26 22 , uh , file set 18 85 . Great . Thanks . [ Theora ] Here we go . Now I 'll need some physical details , Mel . Right . Male Caucasian . Age ? 25 , maybe 30 . - Hair ? - In bunches . Chin ? Sharp . Okay , now the other one . A thing of beauty is a joy forever . Right , now Rayna and then the van . It 's our dad ! [ cheering ] [ beeping ] [ Edison ] I can see why you wouldn 't want to lose her , Mel . Theora , let 's have a hard copy of her and the van , and we 'll start looking for her . She types perfectly . Now let 's get her down to Cryogenics and start the freeze-down . Well , hurry . We can 't do that . There 's a body already on . [ Man on phone ] But he d- - When will you begin the extraction ? Cryogenics are backed up . I 'll have to free , uh , free another body . Uh , an hour at most . I need that pituitary now . Crash freeze or anything . Mason , one word from these people , and we 'll end up as spares in our own body bank . Dump the other body . Bill it to us . There 's no time left for niceties , Mason . Let 's try them . Seen either of these two ? [ Theora ] Keep transmitting , Edison . Okay . I 'm tracking you . This is like trying to find a microchip on a mainframe . The van went east . We 'll get nothing here . I have the local satellite map looking for the route of the van . [ Edison ] Okay , Control , I have it . You 're standing on my porch , Edison . I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize . Busy , my friend ? Yeah . I 'm looking for somebody . You 're gonna need some wheels . Just how serious is this problem with Max ? I mean , confidentially , Bryce , the Zik-Zak Corporation 's very interested in Max . Interested in m-m-m-m-me ? Mm-hmm ? Oh , why not me-me-me ? They want an audience . I like an audience - Shut up , Max . - Bryce . Not a sim-sim-simple game show audience . Everyone . I 'll have an- - ev-ev-ev- - everyone audience . Shut up . Is there nothing you can do to control him ? We 're not dealing with a technical problem anymore . Max has inherited all Edison 's personality but so far none of his self-control . Unfortunately , he just doesn 't relate to me . He seems to want Edison all the time . Are you saying he would talk sense to Carter ? He might . Perhaps so . Dump that body , whoever it is for . We are bringing this one down for a crash freeze . We will risk the tissue damage . We only need the pituitary gland . He said wheels . [ Theora ] Keep your camera alive , Edison . Cutting to you now . What ? [ laughing ] Bring the prince . Leave the camera . Learn . Safe under lock and key . Safer under a blanket . Brilliant . I 'll go to satellite . It 's Rik . Hi , Pancho . Is Reg about ? You got anything ? Just my contagious smile . He went home . A girl named Pancho ? Reg doesn 't like Dominique to know . Ah , shit , that was my favorite blanket ! Annoying , isn 't it ? Losing a vidicam is a hanging offense at 23 . Well , hang loose . Still nothing from Formby , eh ? We dare not risk damaging the girl by rushing the process . I don 't care about the Fringer woman . Do what you want to her . But if Mother dies before the Max Headroom process gets here and we can 't ensure that her mind lives on , your body bank will be swarming with Metrocops in minutes . Now , you wouldn 't want them to know what 's really happening in there , would you ? I 'll get Mason . Uh , if he can 't move her to freeze-down , we 'll arrange immediate collection . We will transfer direct . Edison ? Control to Edison . Edison , are you there ? Damn . Edison . This is a network linker . It 's a bit out of your league , isn 't it , Paula ? So what will you trade for it ? Hmm . What 's that ? It 's a book . Well , what 's that ? It 's a nonvolatile storage medium . It 's very rare . You should have one . Stuff it . [ laughing ] - [ Woman ] Reg . - Oh . Hello , Dominique . Ahem . [ whistling ] Why on earth did you switch off , Edison ? Edison , come on . Come on . [ Woman 's voice ] Edison Carter , report to Control . So what 's the drama ? Edison okay ? - His camera 's gone down . - Oh . I can 't even get an audio link . It 's a nuisance , not a crisis . Yeah , we got one of those , too . I just spoke with Cheviot . They need Max for a big promotion . According to Bryce , he won 't play . Cheviot 's furious . Max said he won 't talk to anyone unless he speaks to Edison first . - And we 've lost Edison . - Yep . That 's great . Theora , a producer 's lot is , um , is not a happy one . [ Man ] Transfer direct . Transfer direct ? But she 's still alive . You must do what he say . Formby , we are desperately short of time . Mother must get the Max Headroom regeneration process now . I 'm moving as fast as I can . Now listen , Plantagenet , our major client has also demanded the Max Headroom process right now . I can 't just walk away with it . I must be very careful . No . I dare not risk the network finding out about it . Now please , please , just give me a little more time . Yes , yes , Zik-Zak- - the c-c-c-corporation that makes you give away your money the nicer way . And here 's something for the man who has no-no-no-nothing in this world . Why not buy him the attractive Zik-Zak Hold-all ? Hold-all , yes , the bag that makes you look as if you have at least something in the world , p-p-p-plus a bag to carry it . - [ Formby ] Look at the ratings . - Wow . But Zik-Zik-Zik-Zak caters for everyone , and especially if you want to ch-ch-ch-check if you 're losing hair . Good decision , Ben . Zik-Zak will be pleased . Ben , you 've saved the day . It wasn 't exactly a decision . Max just appeared . He 's completely unpredictable . I 'll have to see Bryce myself . I think I 'd better come . - Well , couldn 't I- - - Kiss off , Ashwell . H-H-H-Hi there , and welcome back to Network 23 . Listen- - Listen , you can forget all that stuff about Z-Z-Zik-Zak 's Burger Paks , so don 't go reaching for your old leather wallet . That 's just what they t-t-t-taste like ! [ Bryce laughs ] But seriously , have you ever wondered why Zik-Zak Burgers come in plastic packs ? Easy ! Easy ! Some of the plastic rubs off on the burger and doubles the nutritional value . Oh , my God . Bryce ! If you can 't control him , get him off . Stop the thing now . Get him off . [ Max ] ... from New Zealand ... if they ever have any . I tried to warn you , you know . - [ Max ] And- - - I can 't make him stop unless he wants to . - ... in brain damage scare- - - He just self-activates . He thinks it 's a game . Everything he sees is just television . He could go on like this for hours . [ Formby ] Kill the power . Dump the computer . Pull every blasted plug in the building . But get him off . Do you realize that means losing everything that is Network 23 ? The entire system is an interactive logic construct . We 've programmed instinct out- - communication , satellite nets , planning , personnel , decision making , executive oversights , plumbing , ventilation , fire alarms , finance . It 's all locked in . You kill the power , and you 're ordering the execution of your own network . Of course there is an interim solution . We could dump the actual transmission codes and isolate the program long enough for me to erase them . Then Max will only exist in the program itself . Pretty simple , really . If that 's simple , Bryce , complexity must be awesome . However , at least it 'll buy us time to get Carter to talk to Max . Do it . I 'd better have the program software , for safekeeping . I 'm sure it 'll be quite safe , Bryce . [ Max ] ... the Zik-Zak Automatic Bacon Straightener . Yes ! Y-Y-Y-Yes ! No longer will the curly pieces take longer to fry in the pan . B-B-B-Be rasher with your rasher ! [ Woman 's voice on P.A. ] This zone is reserved for complete bodies . Please unload and move on . Parked vehicles will be cited . Small organs to Zone Blue . Please have your deposit forms ready . [ Rik ] Blank Reg . He 'll know these guys you 're looking for , and a lot more . That 's it . As far as I go . He 's waiting on you . Who is ? Uh , what do I owe you , Rik ? Be nice to animals . Weird . Big-Time television . What have I been missing ? ♪ [ hard rock ] ♪ Oh , how she tries ♪ ♪ To cut him down to size ♪ ♪ Telling dirty lies to his friends ♪ ♪ ' Cause his own father said- - ♪ [ volume lowered ] Welcome to Big-Time Television . All day and every day , making tomorrow seem like yesterday . Now , remember when we said there was no future ? Well , this is it . Right . Next up , more of the same . Dom , you smoke too much . Reg , don 't talk to me about personal habits . If you didn 't nail your jeans to the floor at night , they 'd escape . - Good boy . Good boy . - [ dog growling ] [ buzz ] Oh , hello , mate . Oh , don 't mind old Fang . Worst he can do is give you a sloppy lick . Come in . Fang ? Yeah , we call the dog Fang . What 's so strange about that ? This is my mate Dominique . - The boss . - Mr. Carter . I 'm Blank Reg . Sorry about the mess . Rik tells me you know everybody around here . Oh . Yeah . Breugal and Mahler . Evil . They need their heads riveted together . I think you 've stumbled on something very nasty , and I think I know what . Dom , bring us that item Paula brought in . Mm-hmm . Hmm . [ Theora ] Edison Carter , report to Control . I think we should talk about the buy-back on this , squire , if you get my meaning . - [ Dominique ] Reg . - Yeah . Control Edison here . I 'm back with you now . Edison , at last . Stand by . I have Mr. Cheviot on the line . - Cheviot ? - Go ahead , Mr. Cheviot . Carter . At last . We 're having a problem here with your alter egotist , Max Headroom . Can 't control these outbursts of his . Now , in Bryce 's words , Max is now a personality , not a process . It 's his view that you can talk to him , persuade him to cooperate . I want you to get back to the network at once . I believe a girl 's life is being threatened here . I can 't just abandon an assignment to go and have a talk with Max , Mr. Cheviot . This is not a choice I 'm prepared to make . Damn it , I am not offering you a choice here , Carter . I 've ordered your electronic surrogate switched off until you can convince him of his responsibilities . He seems to think this network is some sort of toy . Now it 's imperative that you return here at once and make him see sense . Contact me immediately you arrive . [ laughter , chatter ] [ grunting ] [ burp ] What about the law , though , Reg ? The Metrocops ? They 've broken up crooked body banks before . Law ? In the Fringes ? Justice is cash flow , my son . Hmm . What 's the going rate for loyalty , Reg ? Ask the dog , mate . [ pig grunts ] Let 's go have a talk with Mr. Breugal and Mr. Mahler . Mr. Breugal . [ Mahler growls ] [ glass shatters ] Yaah ! Aah ! You- - I want to talk business , gentlemen . Business is our business ... sir . Where is the regeneration software ? It 's in the system . Obviously not here . [ keyboarding ] Come with me . Come with me . Let 's find out where you 're going . Sybaris condo ? Why is she taking you up there ? I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to switch myself off . It 's safer . Call it professional pride . Smell a ra-ra-rat . Now , why has he gone to the monthly salaries file ? I want to become ... a corpse . Easy transition in the right hands . And I want to be delivered ... to a certain place . Eternity ? You took a girl to a body bank today ... and I want to go to the same one . How sweet . Our privilege . Has Carter reported in yet ? Anything from Bryce ? Very well , get me Formby . She 's left ? You mean you have no idea where she is ? Rest in peace , Mr. Carter . Go quietly into your grave . A gift , Dr. Mason . Enjoy . Aah ! Dr. Mason , don 't think , just answer . Where 's the girl that the two gentlemen brought ? - [ grunt ] - Treachery ! Traitor ! Traitor to the mother . What 's the mother ? - Talk . - [ crunch ] Physician , heal thyself . It 's like Christmas . Where is Formby ? [ Edison ] Just let us run with it , Murray . You have nothing to run with . We don 't have a thing about who , where , anything . Hey , Murray . What ? Well , he 's right . Get me Carter . Edison , I 've got Mr. Cheviot on for you . What , now ? Carter . Well , it 's about time . Carter , I want to make it very clear that if you don 't talk to Max , we 're prepared to pull your show and what 's more terminate your operating clearance code immediately . This will effectively stop you from using Network 23 resources for what seems to become your own purposes . I will not allow even you , Carter , to disobey my instructions . You want me to choose between a girl 's life and a job ? You know my answer already . With respect , Mr. Cheviot , the priority is clear . With respect , my priority is Max Headroom and this network . Now , I don 't know anything about this girl , but to help her , you need the network , and to have our support , you need your show . And the only way to keep that is to persuade Max to cooperate and present the Zik-Zak promotion . The priority is clear , Mr. Cheviot . Now look , Edison , let 's back off here , okay ? Now , you and Max are like one person . You have a mental umbilical . You 're inseparable . You share experience , behavior , temperament , logic . Now , we all of us share a rather nasty problem . Solve it , for everybody 's sake , - including this girl . - [ static ] Theora . Yeah ? - Get Max on . - Okay . That 's odd . He 's not in his file . [ whispering ] I don 't know . - Call Bryce . - Okay . Trace inhibited ? Nothing . Damn it ! The girl 's ready . I can operate immediately . Then we will need the Max Headroom process . Make this work , Formby . Save her , and you save your precious Cheviot . Otherwise , your mutual indiscretions will become public knowledge . It 's really quite simple . Once this little operation is over , we 'll want you to repeat the process you applied to Mr. Carter on our respective patient here . You must help me , Bryce . Your computer generation process is the only hope . You must generate her mind , just as you generated Max from Edison Carter . She 's very wealthy and powerful , you see . This is not a choice . What will you need to replicate her after we complete the transplant ? That girl 's alive . You can 't- - I mean- - Got anything ? - Ohh . - What ? This graphic keeps accessing my screen . What is going on ? I know . I 'll run a maintenance mode through it . It 's a map . It 's a transport surface route depicter . I know . It has no business here . That 's even weirder . It 's originating in monthly salaries . It 's a restricted access . You won 't get in there . But you can root out from that file . If some clerk is in it and trying to clear with the wrong code , it could be dumping on us . Edison , it could jam us until the idiot closes down . Control ! C-C-C-C-Control ! [ Theora ] This is Control . Not you . I 'm trying to control myself . [ chuckle ] Where are you sourcing ? I 'm in Accounts . I 've been trying to find a deflec-deflec-deflec - deflection port . This one 's just opened . So dreary . Max , this is very important . I have to talk to you . What 's on our mind ? What are you doing ? I 'm linking to my terminal to access that regeneration software you need . That 's the only one the command structure will obey . If I use this direct , my own security will dump me . Just be very careful who you talk to . Max , unless you cooperate with the network , they 're going to kill my show and with it almost certainly a young girl . Max , please help me . And her . Asking is just polite de-de-demanding . That sounds familiar . It sh-sh-should . It 's one of yours . I know . I- - I- - I have a polite demand , a ques-ques-question . Okay . I want to know two things . 1- - why is there a fuzzy hole in my memory- - in my memory bank ? And 2-2-2- - what is drinking-king-king-king ? [ Edison , Theora laugh ] And was it- - was it- - was it drinking that caused the fuz-fuz-fuzzy hole ? Make that- - Make that three things . Okay . 1- - it was a graduation party . 2- - it wrecks you . And 3- - yes , it was . In that order . In that case , how many times did you gradu-gradu-gradu-graduate ? Because there 's a lot more I need to get straight . - [ Formby ] What 's that ? - Accounts . I can see that . Why ? When I requisition transport to bring it here , I need a purchase account . That 's the system . As you presumably don 't want this account traceable , I have to create a spurious file to open account codes and blank it later . Or I could access to your file , if you 'd like . Don 't be clever , Bryce . Sorry . I rather thought that 's why I was here . Hold on . There 's someone in my file . That 's from the same file again . And there 's something else , Edison . Look . Too far . Too far . What 's that ? Nothing . It 's just a transportation selection file . Oh . Max , where is this input sourcing ? Hold on . I know that code . That 's Bryce 's code , the door code . This is from Bryce . Why ? Where ? The map . Look , and Rayna 's face from the identity template . This is all part of Max ' program , Max ' primary system . And Bryce must have watched our construction as it ran . He 's with her . Got it . Murray . - You got it ? - It has to be . Edison will need help . Four men . Santui condo . Go . Go ! Well , I 'm in the file that Bry-Bry-Bry-Bryce is using . Yes , I know . And it would be so , so easy to access his route and- - Do it ! Do it , Max ! What are you doing ? You little- - What are you- - What are you- - What are you doing with Bryce ? Hi , Bryce . Here I am . I was right . I did smell a r-r-r-rodent . Max , right . Here it is . I 've got that program online . That is what you wanted , isn 't it ? That 's Formby . I-I-I-I knew Bryce shouldn 't have trusted her . Edison , acknowledge Control . We 're almost there , Control . You have opposition- - two doctors and Formby . Formby ? How do you know ? Max is looking at her right now . What 's she got to do with this ? I don 't know . If we can locate Bryce , we might find out . [ Edison ] Sending to the roof , Control . Number 2 chopper in close support . [ beeping ] Okay , we 're in and descending to the level . My God , that entire level is owned by one person . Better get Cheviot . We 're at the door . Give me the code . Edison , quick- - 506 274 . Go . [ door smashes in ] [ doctor ] Who are you ? Mother ! Mother ! Rayna . Rayna . Miss Formby ? How 'd you know ? Max Headroom told me . Okay , Max , let 's go . Is this where I co-co-co-co-operate ? Yeah , if you 're ever going to . Hmm . This is M-M-Max Headroom presenting courtesy of the Zik-Zik-Zik-Zik-Zak Corporation , an Edison Carter late-night special-cial-cial-cial . The show that answers the questions ... others dare not ask . Run title . We are about to reveal how an organization in this city has been supplying the wealthy , the corrupt , and the privileged with organs taken from healthy young people . The Fringes of our city have been a living stockpile for a grotesque form of biological engineering- - live spare parts . - Come on , my son . - Now , live and direct- - - Go for it . - ... as I try to help this girl who almost- - And I 'll-I 'll-I 'll be back in a few moments with more from Network 23 . They- - They blackmailed me , Ben . They knew about- - about you and me . I couldn 't- - I couldn 't risk your reputation . You took a terrible chance . Without Carter 's tenacity , they might have succeeded . You would have been permanently vulnerable . But we weren 't . It 's over . We were over a long time ago , Julia . I meant ... neither one of us were compromised . You have a network to run . Yes , we do , Julia . Get Edwards in here . Sit down . We haven 't had a ratings battle for a couple of minutes .

No casualties . 15 seconds , Edison . Ha ! Coming off you soon . Peter , I need seven seconds filled . Theora , 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . This is Edison Carter live and direct . [ Edison ] I want to show you something rare . This was a dream palace . Years ago people came here for their pictures . To share dreams and adventures together . These are the days when people sat in groups and watched a single movie . Sometimes hundreds of people at one time . Must have been a weird experience . People watching the same screen and the same program . I can 't use more than 30 seconds . Nostalgia isn 't what it used to be . [ Edison ] How about you ? Do you know what a movie was ? My mom told me about it once . Didn 't you have to pay for it or something ? Uh-Um , is it about standing in line ? [ Edison ] Has anybody else know ? How about you ? For a shared experience , Mr. Carter . People who gathered together and communal escapism to share adventure , excitement , laughter , romance . They shared these vicarious emotions together . That was before they chocked the talent out of this business . Gave us game shows and chat shows and news . Great , that should stir it upstairs . Stay with it . Before the world became ratings and people became demographics and everything became the product . Yeah , fighting talk . It 's a pretty articulate view . Almost poetic . What 's your name . Don 't you recognize me , Eddy ? It 's Paddy . Paddy Ashton . Paddy Ashton ? Cut it , Control . What ? Um , cut off logo . Dung Po , link Ralph . Take whatever he 's got from Rome . Hit it ! Hello , Eddy . Hello , Paddy . What do you say to a little drink ? Hello , little drink . [ Woman ] Coming soon , a dream view 24-hour channel . Subscribe now for the hottest programming anywhere .

You beat me almost fair and square . You won . It 's your way . Oh , come on , Paddy . That 's history now , too . Okay ? I 've been there . I know . Time was when you bought me a drink when I was broke , remember ? One swallow doesn 't make a summer , pal . [ Edison ] Well , you haven 't lost your sense of humor anyway . No , but I lost everything else . It 's the most portable thing I got left . [ button beeps ] He 's nice . Funny . What happened to him , Murray ? God ... Well , um , when I was made producer- - Well , they were both up for the top job , the lead reporter on my show . And they worked up together- - communication room , tape ops , local controller , then in-field reporter . They were good friends . And they were great rivals and , uh- - I don 't know that 's it . No , no , no , that 's it . They 're at Ouzo Bar . I mean what happened to Paddy ? Edison beat him to big story . Edison won an award . Mm-hmm . The Vidi . And it got him the job . No , Murray , you gave Edison the job . Right . I chose the best . That 's it . Come on , Paddy , it was a fair fight . You had Murray in your pocket . He liked you . Oh , why not ? You 're a nice guy . Now , wait a second . Just being a nice guy doesn 't get you the job . No , I know . You need killer instinct . Yeah , well , I guess I deserve that . You know , I could be right were you are . Oh , come off it , Eddy . If I had half your age , I 'd be in your position now . Maybe I was just too human for the job . Oh , thanks a lot . I 'm due for a microchip service any day now . My mind 's a computer , you know . Yeah , I heard . How is Max Headroom ? Yeah , come on . I 'll show you how to earn my living . Who knows ? We might do a story on it . I 've not given up , Eddy . Come . We can never cross advertise our cost with that deal . Mr. Finn , you 'll achieve break-even in 36 days . I 'm running your padded expense reports . An average of 27 % on all your contracts . How did you get these figures ? Information is our business , Finn . Figures are trade . Deal ? Fine . Have a nice day , Mr. Finn . See you later . [ Bella ] So we get 5 creds from each subscriber . Our anticipated ratings are 248 million . Project profit per screen minute 116 million creds . Dream Vu Micro-Link Channel is almost ready to launch . This is going to be the most devastating weapon in subscriber television . We might even dent network TV . There 's a challenge . Theora , I have you Edison . Trace running . Pals ? Mmm . [ Edison ] Where we headed , Paddy ? [ Paddy ] Sort of following up on your story . I mean not so much at Dream Palace as dream factory . You might find it very interesting . It might be an angle . It 's a bit like the old days , Eddy . It 's a bit like being a network exec . You get to spend the days talking in your sleep . He hasn 't changed . [ Paddy ] Suits me . I can 't sleep nights where I live . I 'm in the cardboard condos on Metal Road . They weld all night . It 's like being in a belfry in an earthquake . Watch yourself . Your the only guy I know who can get creds for sleeping . It 's work . They pay me to dream . It 's like giving blood , only they empty your head and not your arm . There it is . [ Edison ] Back door to the old movie theater ? [ Paddy ] Ironic , isn 't it ? People used to come here to get their dreams . And now they come here to give them up . Well . It was nice seeing you again , Eddy . I 'm off to sleep perchance to dream .

Well , how- - Well , how , - - Well , how can I be unconscious ? I 'm either on or off . I don 't-don 't-don 't have this weird biological in-between . What 's-What 's like-ke-ke ? Kind of like free-falling through your imagination , I guess . And you release your subconscious desires . But if- - But if dreaming is all your sub-sub-subconscious desires coming out , why do p-p-people wait till their asleep to do it ? You got a point there . I 'll r-r-rerun one of yours . See if I can get the picture . I 'll see you in your dreams . [ chuckles ] I 'm going to see Paddy . Well , I might just come down and join you .

[ Man on speaker ] Clear the boiler room . Laser cutting the nine above sector eight minutes . Hey , hey . Hold on . Where 's Paddy ? Paddy Ashton . Mr. Carter , delighted , deeply moved . [ Edison ] Paddy . We 've had a few like this lately . Friend of yours , Mr. Carter . Very thoughtful , Mr. Carter . Your friend will be gently spirited away to Gladhand Meadows where he will rest in one piece and go all eternity . If you go near a body bank ... I 'll kill you . I believe you will . He will be safe . Cash is honor , Mr. Carter . High principle attends high payment . Where 's your other colleague , Breugal ? Mr. Mahler ? I was short on stock one night . He made the supreme sacrifice . This new Mahler is on approval . Theora , run a side cam trace on that van . [ Theora ] I already am , ace . Edison , I 'm sorry about Paddy . I really am . [ Woman 's voice ] This is your Network 23 sunrise report bringing you only the good news . Edison ? Come on , Edison . Morning . You look ghastly . You 're early . Wait . I haven 't been to bed . I just want to follow up on Paddy 's story . What story ? You can 't believe Paddy . Murray , can I have a word with you ? Paddy was killed yesterday . I don 't follow . It doesn 't make any sense . Paddy make it to Gladhand 's Crematorium , okay ? Paddy 's death doesn 't make sense , either , Murray . I feel responsible . Oh , come on . Come on , you can 't pull that one . You 're not responsible . Patty would have died anyway without you needing him . Don 't start crying crocodile tears over Paddy . Murray , that 's unforgivable . And don 't you start . Paddy was a nice guy . We didn 't do this . He was betrayed by the limits of his own potential . These notes prove it . It 's drivel . I can 't believe you . You 're being so insensitive . I spent the entire night trying to work this dribble out , Murray . When I left him , he said he was onto something . He said he was on to a story . I think the clue to what it was is in this stuff . It 's all about dreams . But I can 't get into the right files in the main frame . " To sleep the chance to dream , bill the scribbler . The night horse rides the black shores of sleep . " Dreams all right . You 've accessed the right file type , but you 've gone off at tangents all over the system . Let me have a go . Okay , night horse . Of course , nightmares . [ Edison ] Took me hours to get that wrong . You 're brilliant . [ keyboard clicks ] Right there . [ Theora ] Right , nightmares . Specialist trauma research on evidence of neurosis- - deep psychological damage as result of night terrors . Paddy was on to something . Get on me , Theora . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna go into that place . Well , don 't start bringing out your conscience in public . Give me a break , Murray . I 'm gonna make damn sure I find out why Paddy Ashton died last night . Well , just make sure it 's a story ! [ Man ] Let 's go , move quickly . Mind 's Eye research participants sign contracts here . Quickly , people . Hello , Cherubs .

You 're gonna have to replace me . [ Theora ] Run a long dream , Max . Ridiculous , Theora . Listen , dreams only last a few seconds . They just seem to last longer in their inner synapses limbo . What you 'd call a subconscious . It won 't work . [ Theora ] Edison . Edison ? Edd- - Oh , hell . He 's gone , it 's too late . Okay , Max , you got to run several dreams . You know , lots of dreams . Hell . [ keyboarding ] Lis-Listen , I don 't mind being the pro-pro-projectionist , but don 't forget no-no-no one is paying me to be the censor .

Blimey , Edison . I need your help . Yes , of course I recognizes that , Finn . It is a Network 23 vidicam . Where is the operator ? Gone . But worst news is we 've had another nightmare-induced trauma . I 'm beginning to have one myself . Our whole strategy for Dream View relies on these shows of yours . But what about this reporter ? Could that camera have transmitted one of those dreams ? Absolutely not . We switched it off the second we found it . But the odd thing is there were dreams coming from inside it . Maybe some old recordings . Finn , the point is you switched it off . Forget the reporter . Your job at Mind 's Eye is to give us that dream material fast .

And I thought , " Is this his dream , nightmare , or his just his wishful thinking ? " When I 'm suddenly c-c-cut off . Fortunately , I don 't dream . I perform subconscious calculation . My equivalent of jogging . How-How-How do you know you don 't dream if you 're asleep ? Hmm ? Ah , that 's something I calculated . [ laughs ] You 're becoming quite a humorist , Bryce . A-A-A-ah , Edison . Uh , he 's my pupil . Not very good . Keeps trying to analyze all the p-p-punch lines so he can tell them at the beginning to save time . [ laughs ] Is Theora there yet ? Yes , I am . I also have the book . You all right , Edison ? How are you at codes , Bryce ? Oh , brilliant . What do you have . Some sort of word game . Ahh , easy .

Well , you have to work together with Max . Combine the logical with the intuitive . Oh , that will be fun . Yeah , well , make it fast fun , will you ? Theora , stay with them . And feed me the results here at Big-Time . [ Max ] Uh , before you go . That d-d-d-dream with bunch of fruit and the Roman bath , where they red or white ? The grapes , I mean .

World 's first dog video jock . Don 't knock him . I just have never seen him not eating or sleeping before . Wonder where he gets it from . Nepotism , mate . Cup a tea ? - Yeah . - Dom ? I 'm apparently in training to replace the dog . He 'll be doing the accounts soon . [ chuckles ] Can Dom operate a relay link ? Oh , yeah . Do anything . Especially for you . Look , mind if I say something ? I 've listened to what you 've said . I know how it feels to loose a mate , but you can 't wear your heart on your sleeve all the time . Messes up your appearance . I 'll get the tea . Oh , it 's with us or without us is that it ? It 's with us . Just don 't forget who you are as well as Paddy 's friend . But let 's be off . Dom , stow the tea . Let 's make room for me and get ready for sea . Fang , station announcement please , my son . Two hours off air . Tell them we 're gonna go walkies . You 're a pro , Fang . [ Fang barks ] Hello ? I 'm sorry . Hello , who ? Dominique , is that you ? This is the Edison Carter Rolling In-Field Relay Unit requesting link . Do you read me ? 10-5- - Damn . 4 , we are rolling , Control . Over . I 'm afraid it 's the actress in her , mate . Well , it 's just as well you left your vidicam . Can 't go charging about with a sodding great thing like that . Well , there 's villains in the place . Take the wheel , will you ? [ Dominique ] I have you loud and clear . Bandits anticipated at Angles niner-zero . Over . Dominique , what are you talking about ? I 've got sat cam 0680 in orbiting lock on . Tally-ho , Control ! Friend , voilà . It 's an infrared camera used by sewer inspectors . It 's short range and a limited battery life , but very handy for nefarious activities in the dark . If you know what I mean ? Edison , your Big-Time camera link is strong showing you arriving at Mind 's Eye . How much you want for it , son ? 20 creds to sleep and dream . You should be fabulous , dear . Old punk dreams . Heavy metal , mate . Music of the angels . Brandy of the damned . Punks of the world unite ! Wall up ! Give it a bit of a welly . [ yells ] Reg . Sign here . Sorry . [ giggles ] Uh , next . Hey , Edison . Come on . - Reg . - Shut up . Put them on , come on . Wear them or else , you old skinhead . Oh ! Easy , Reg , easy . Looks like a good bunch . 13 's a bit repetitive , but we got a guy on 14 dreaming he 's a girl . Might be interesting . Dom , where the lights ? Where am I ? [ Dominique ] Oh , Reg , use the camera . Use the infrared . Sometimes you 're impossible . [ Reg ] Aah , right . Here we are . [ Announcer ] Step into the Mind 's Eye . Do you want to experience direct the wildest dreams and fantasies of people as they happen ? Feel your desires in an erotic novel . See what lies in the secret dreams of the executive , the young girl , the husky he-man , the poor and the rich- - [ Theora ] Murray , what was that ? I don 't know . That was us celebrating my promotion five years ago . [ Announcer ] Straight from the Mind 's Eye . Sorry , Ed , I thought it was the lights . Doesn 't matter . You cracked it , Reg . That 's an ad up on that screen . An ad ? For what ? Dreams . They 're stealing dreams and it 's killing people . I killed Paddy Ashton . [ projector powers down ] [ Theora ] Edison , come in please . Go ahead , Control . Edison , your batteries are fading . I 'm boosting your audio only . Go ahead , Bryce . I managed to crack your friend 's code . I think you 'll find it quite interesting material . All right , Bryce . Give it to me . May I- - May I just say that this was a joint effort-t-t ? Logic , 10 % . His . Poetic intuition , 90 % . Mine . [ Edison ] Max , I don 't have time for this now . It was a simple matter to extrapolate . Lots of mystical nonsense about magic eyes , third eyes , all that . then I got it- - pineal glands . What is he on about ? Just hurry up , Bryce ! It 's pretty simple , really . The pineal gland was once here , on top of the brain . A light-sensitive gland . Birds still have them , and in lizards and salamanders , they 're connected to an eye-like structure on the dorsal surface of the head . Anyway , in a real sense , it was once an eye . Dreams occur randomly in the electrochemical brain storage system- - the subconscious mind , as romantics have always wrongly called it . Now , the pineal is sort of a chemical gate , and , with the right drugs , it can make the images transfer backwards from the brain to the eye and actually play back on the eye 's retina . The optimum conditions would be brain rest or sleep , thus a dreaming state . Simple . The brain just empties dreams out into the eye . You can record them . I should have thought of this before . You know , this may be what causes REM- - R-E-M- - rapid eye movement during dreaming . By the way , uh , they could only capture those images on film through some sort of telecine machine . Does that help ? I 've got everything I need . - [ knocking ] - [ Man ] You in there ! - Well , whatever it is- - - Come on , open up ! ... someone doesn 't want you to have it . Control , what 's the layout here ? Only one door . Oh , there is a film reel lift by the projector . It looks pretty small , though . - Roger ! - Come out of there ! [ Dominique ] Oh , well done , Reg ! Murrat , murrat , murrah ! [ Reg ] Whoa ! [ thump ] [ Edison ] God ! [ thump ] Oh , sorry , squire . I didn 't want to hang about . Ahem . We 're okay now . Clean away . Lovely . [ dog snarling ] Dom , for crying out loud . Dominique , put it down , please . You should take things more seriously . I was guarding my turf . I even got Fang to growl . [ laughing ] The girl in there had a nightmare trauma . I know that 's what happened to Paddy . It killed him . Those people killed him , Murray . They know this process is lethal . Can be lethal . May be . Now take it easy , Edison . You have a personal involvement here , and I can 't let it influence your judgment , particularly if this thing is killing people . All right , I need a clear view here . I 'm going back in , Murray . I want this ! Those people are using dreams as entertainment , and they 're killing people to get it . It 's mind rape ! The only way we can stop them is by proving they 're killing people . Don 't take me off this one , Murray . Edison ? Edison ? Damn it . He 's too close to it , Theora . It 's unprofessional . It 's dangerous . This is what you call his unshakeable determination . No , it 's what I call his pig-headed stubbornness . What are we going to do ? Get Angela in the chopper . I 'm going down there . Edison Carter , news break- - I 'm coming . Clear me a 10-minute window . Speculate 12 on the story . - 12 , got it . - This may be tight . Dung Po , you have control . Mind 's Eye research participants , sign contracts here . This place is shut down ! Go home ! Sign contracts here . Quickly , people . Wake up ! Come on ! Wake up ! Get your goggles on ! Wake up ! [ Reg ] Come on ! Wakey-wakey ! - Rise and shine ! - Wake up ! Come on ! Get out of here ! Wake up ! Come on ! Move it ! Wakey-wakey ! Wake up ! Geronimo ! I tell you , Edison Carter is in here . I 'm getting out , Grieg . If Carter 's on to this , he 'll find out about the girl , about that Fringer guy . I 'm out . Let 's go , Control . [ Theora ] Standing by . Listen , Edison , Murray 's coming down- - I 'm going live , Control . 3 , 2 , 1 , go . This is Edison Carter , live and direct from the Mind 's Eye . This is the story of Paddy Ashton , my friend and colleague who died right here . This is outrageous ! How dare you burst in here ! I 'm accusing you of causing the death of at least two people . You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . - I want you out of here . - Try it . Edison ! I demand my rights . What right did you extend to Paddy Ashton , the man who died here yesterday ? He was insane . He was unbalanced . He left here perfectly well physically . Oh , you liar . He left here dead . Bravo . Turn that thing off . Well , congratulations . You 've just gone live and direct to millions of people with pictures of the world 's top telejournalist punching out an interviewee . I expect that 's what you call breakthrough television . Back off , Murray ! He killed Paddy ! He 's selling this stuff to a lousy subscriber channel ! - He deserved it ! - Quite probably . But not from you , not from us . We carry out objective investigative journalism , not personal vendetta . He killed Paddy Ashton for his dreams ! Then you better knock me down , too . I also broke Paddy 's dreams years ago , when I chose you instead of him . He died a bit then , too . So go ahead , knock me down . Go ahead . You do to me what you did to him over there . I think you owe somebody an apology . I think we both do . [ Murray ] There 's nothing I want to say . Then I 'll just say I 'm sorry . To both of you . Are you okay ? Is that a professional inquiry ? No . How long is it since anyone told you you were a great guy ? Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services , Inc . Burbank , CA

 This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship " Red Dwarf " , The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak , The only survivors were ; Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold , Revived three million years later , his only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer - a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew , I am Holly , the ship 's computer , with an IQ of 6,000 - the same IQ as 6,000 PE teachers , # I n a crater , on a ast 'roid excavati ng for a mine , # Lived an old plutonium miner , and his daughter Clementine # - Lister . RD 52169 . - Yeth ? Can I help you ? - You 've got a lisp . - Yeth , I know , The malfunction has been reported , Thorry for the inconvenienth , Give me a bacon sandwich with French mustard and black coffee . Your vocabulary unit 's not working either . Thith altho hath been reported , Thorry for the inconvenienth , - Can you just try a black coffee ? - I 'll certainly try , - That 's a bucket . - Thorry , # Do , do , do , da da ... # Morning , Lister . How 's life , you pregnant baboon-bellied space beatnik ? What 's the plan for today , then ? Slobbing in the morning , then slobbing in the afternoon , then a snooze before the main evening slob ? You 're a disgrace to the species . Good morning , Rimmer . Clock stop ! 6.47 . Not a bad little time for the mile . Pity I was only doing the 300 metres . I had that conversation with Lister . Knock ... 4 minutes off for that . Plus a little rest , so I wouldn 't looked shagged out as I passed him . So , knock that off and ... I 've broken the world record , well done . I 'm fitter than I thought . Holly , give me a clean uniform . - 9,47 am , Arnold , - No , a clean uniform , you idiot . - I 'm rather busy at the moment , - Now ! And give me a crewcut . I 'm beginning to look like a Hell 's Angel . We 're going to hit light speed in 24 hours , I have to navigate a ship the size of a city through speeds never experienced in the human sphere , I 'm not a combination of the Speaking Clock , Moss Bros and Teasy-Weasy , Holly , a hologram I may be . But I 'm sti ll the highest ranking technician aboard this ship . If I say do something , you do it . Understand ? You stupid , jumped-up filofax . - I 'm a what ? - You heard . - Just get on with it . Very short . - OK , Arnold , - Have you done it , Hol ? - Yes , - A crewcut , and it 's very short ? - Yes , Arnold , As my father always said , shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut , and you can cope with anything . He said that just before all that unfortunate suicide business . Ah , now that 's me with Jim Bexley Speed . He played for the London Jets Zero Gravity Football Team . He was roof attack . He was really , really , really , really thrilled to meet me . - Who 's that guy ? - That 's me grandmother . She brought me up . She was a great old lady . She got me expelled from school because she nutted the headmaster . Wow . That 's nice . It 's just a Jupiter rise . Everyone takes that shot . Who is that ? That 's me Dad . It 's me only photo . He 's your father ? No wonder you 're so ugly . - No , that 's his dog , Hannah . - Dawwg ? What 's a dawwg ? - It 's just a pet . - Ugleeeeee ! You go get your stuff and let me pack mine . Will you do that ? This ... dog . Better not be around here or I may have to chase him . Oh , yeah . Do you know how big they are ? They 're about 18 feet long with teeth as big as your leg . Oh , yes , well , I may have to chase him anyway . Aaaaaw ! Oh , Lennon ! Look what 's happened to McCartney . So , mechanical engineering ! Hey ! Perfection ! And they said you was a waste of money . - What 's he looking at ? - Who ? That idiotic cat . - What have you done to your hair ? - Holly did it . - Why ? - I ordered him to . - It looks ridiculous . - It may look ridiculous to you , but I like it like this . I feel like a man . Yeah . And you 'll probably get one , looking like that . Short hair gives a man a sense of dignity , a sense of discipline . - Have you seen it ? - I don 't need to see it . I didn 't get it to look good . This is a haircut for action , not poncing around in . Maybe a bit severe . A bit too Green Beret . But you are how you look , and I look ... like a complete and total tit ! Holly ! Holly ! This is a recording , Holly is busy at the moment , Leave a message after the bleep and he 'll get back to you , Bleep , Holly , this is Rimmer . Remember me ? Rimmer . Arnold Rimmer . The poor goit you made look like Helen Shapiro . I 'll see you toast in the fires of Hell for this . Did someone say they wanted toast ? No , shut up . - What are you doing ? - I 'm going into stasis . Holly tell you ? Stasis ? What for ? While we go through light speed . I thought I may as well stay till we get back to Earth . Earth ? That 's three million years away . You can 't leave me that long - I 'll go peculiar . Holly , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to be rude . Can I please have my own hair back ? - Pretty please , with sugar on ? - I 'll think about it , Arnold , Holly 's supposed to have told you . I thought you didn 't mind . Mind ? Mind ? Why should I mind ? 3,000 millennia alone , while you 're in suspended animation ? I 'll do that crossword book - that should kill a couple of centuries . Holly 'll switch you off till we come out . Switch me on , switch me off , like a battery-powered sex aid . - Don 't give me this . - Give you what ? I 'm dead , or haven 't you noticed ? I know you 're dead . Don 't whinge on . Sorry to be a bore . You 're everything you were when you were alive . Same personality , same everything . Apart from the detail that I 'm a stiffy . Death isn 't the handicap it was in the olden days . It doesn 't screw your career like it used to . But if you had two people coming for a job and one was dead , which would you pick ? Well , depends on which was best qualified . Bullpats . When did you last see a dead newsreader ? Channel 27 had a hologram reading the news . Oh ... groovy , funky Channel 27 . Big smegging deal . You livies hate us deadies . If I 'm going back to Earth , I have to go into stasis . It 's gonna take 4,000 years just to turn around . You can 't do a three-point turn this close to light speed . Really ? Read that in the Ladybird Book of Astronavigation ? It happens to be true . I know . I 've taken the astronavigation exam nine times . Ten , counting the time I had my spasm . You 'll only be turned off till we get back to Earth . Where you won 't need me , so I won 't get switched back on . They may cure you . They may have made advances while we were away . I expect they cured death the instant we left Earth . I expect doctors ' surgeries are packed with the dead . " Mrs Johnstone , take one of these three times a day , " you 'll soon be living again . Carole , next corpse , please . " - They might . - Yes , if the Earth hasn 't blown up . Or the ants haven 't taken over . Well , you 'll be in your element . You 'll get a decent job at last . - Yeah , yeah . - You 'll run for government . - Yeah , yeah . - You 'll even make it as a male model . Git . # To Ganymede and Titan # Yes , sir , I 've been around . # But there ain 't no place in the whole of ... space # Like that good ol ' toddlin ' town ... # Oh , oohh ... # Lunar City ... # # Lunar City 7 ... # You can 't sing , you know , - You can , can you ? - As a toaster , I 'm tone deaf , am I ? Go on , then . Welcome to the Starlight Ballroom ... # Fly me to the moon and let me ... # # Lunar City 7 ... # - What was that ? ! - Er , 11 , 14 ship time , Dave , No , Holly , what was that flash ? We 've broken the light barrier 22 hours early , Is everyone all right ? I can 't do it , I can 't cope , Me bottle 's gone , Holly , is everyone all right ? No , I 'm not , I thought I could navigate at light speed but I can 't wrap me head round it , Gordon Bennet , that was a close one ! What 's the problem ? You 've an IQ of 6,000 ! We 're travelling faster than the speed of light , By the time we see something , we 've already passed through it , Even with an IQ of 6,000 , it 's still brown trousers time , Can I help ? It 's all right , I 'm getting the hang of it now , Left a bit ... straighten her up , I better go , # To Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've ... # Rimmer ! Rimmer ! # To Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been ... # Rimmer ! What ? What is it ? Do you see anything really weird in that mirror ? Yes . You , you ugly goit . - No . It was really odd . - What was ? Nothing . Forget it , doesn 't matter . - What doesn 't matter ? - Nothing , forget it . Have you been at the marijuana gin ? Forget it . It doesn 't matter . Fine . If you have more problems with nothing and things that don 't matter , just scream my name hysterically , and I 'll come pelting down the corridor ! # This little kitty went to space ... # This little kitty stayed at home # Ooohh , aaaahh , tcheee ... - # My clothes are ... # - What are you doing ? What you said , dude . I said take a few essentials that you couldn 't bear to leave . Right . These are all I 'm taking . These and the other ten racks . Travel light , move fast . You can 't take it all . There 's no room . OK . I 'll leave ... this . I 'll just have to do without it . - You can take two suits , that 's it . - Two suits ? - Then I 'm staying . - You can 't stay . - When I come out , you 'll be dead . - Two suits IS dead . If I cut off my leg and leave it behind , can I take three ? Going into stasis in 10 minutes , meet you in the sleeping quarters . - Rimmer , I 've been thinking . - What ? - About going into stasis . - How did I do what ? What do you mean , " How did I do what ? " - Lister , don 't be a gimboid . - I 'm not being a gimboid . I 've been in the library , thinking . I 've decided ... Shut up . As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted , I 've decided when you go into stasis I want to be left behind . On your own , for the rest of your life ? - What things ? - Eh ? - I said , what ? - What 's going on ? - You are space crazy . - I 'M space crazy ? ! You 're the one who 's ... space crazy . It probably is déja-vu . It sounds like it . Aaaagh ! Rimmer , I 've just seen you walk out of that door . - What ? - How did you do that ? - How did I do what ? - You just walked out of that door . Lister , don 't be a gimboid . I swear , as you walked out that door , you came in this one . I 've been in the library , and I 've decided ... - I 'm telling you ... - Shut up . As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted , when you go into stasis I want to be left behind . You just came in and said exactly that . - What ? - You said that . - What ? - And that . You said that . - You are space crazy . - And then you said ... " It probably is déja-vu . " It probably is déja-vu . It sounds like it . Go on , then : shake your head and walk out . Rimmer , listen . Will you just listen ? My tooth ! I think I lost my tooth ! Cat , wait . Rimmer , listen . I 'm gonna eat the little fishies . I 'm gonna ... oh-oh ... ah-ha ! I was just making sure your fish were OK . I wasn 't going to eat them . - He just walked past us . - Must be the light speed . - Holly , what 's going on ? - It 's light speed , I bet . - Is your name Holly ? - " Is your name Holly " Holly , what is going on ? I 'm a 10th generation Al hologramic computer , I 'm not your mum , Yes , fantastic . Do you want a hand with your homework , or me to sew little nametags in your PE kit ? Holly , watch my li ps . What is hap - pen - ing ? With the mirror , the cat , everything ... You 're seeing future echoes , Didn 't I explain ? What are future echoes ? - How simple do you want this ? - So Lister can understand it . Ohh , Oh , dear , Difficult , I know . We 're travelling faster than L , S , Right ? - What 's L.S. ? - Light Speed , - Smartarse . It 's catching up with things you 're to do before you 've done them , - We 're seeing bits of the future ? - Yes , Told you it was light speed . You should 've asked me . - Can they see us ? - Of course not , Use your loaf , Wait . So the Cat 's gonna break his tooth some time in the future ? I didn 't think you wanted it THIS simple , Ain 't nobody gonna break my tooth . How long is this going to last ? Till the reverse thrust takes effect and we drop below light speed , - What 's that photograph ? - Me and Frankenstein , isn 't it ? - No . The one with the babies . - Babies ? I 've never seen it before . Holly , is this what you call a future echo ? Yes , of course it is ! Bozo , Two babies . How did I get two babies ? # Ganymede and Titan , Yes , sir , I 've been around # But there ain 't no place in the whole of space # What 's this , guys ? " Don 't go into stasis . Please don 't leave us with Rimmer . " I 'm sorry , guys , I 've got to . We need you . There 's nothing for me here . I want to go back to Earth . Don 't do that . I don 't care what it 's like . It must be better than this . The dolphins may be in charge of people in a human being-atarium . I just want to find out . What was that ? ! - What was that ? - Brace yourself for a shock . - I just saw you die . - What ? I did warn you to brace yourself . - You didn 't give me a chance . - I gave you ample bracing time . You didn 't ... you didn 't even pause . I 'm sorry . I 've just had a rather nasty experience . I 've just seen someone I know die in the most hideous way ! - Yeah , me ! - You were fiddling with a navicomp ... I don 't wanna know . I don 't wanna know . - You don 't want to know ? - No ! Was it quick ? Well , I wouldn 't say it was super-fast . Not if you count the thrashing around and agonised squealing . - You 're loving this , aren 't you ? - What a horrible thing to say . - It was definitely me ? - Oh , yes . I don 't wanna know . - How old did I look ? - How old are you now ? - 25 . How old did I look ? - Mid-twenties . Smeg ! I 'm not ready . I 'm not smegging ready ! You did seem surprised . Did you actually see me face ? You were wearing a hat , but it was you . I won 't wear a hat and it can 't happen . Can it ? - I can live without a hat . - Lister , it has happened . You can 't change it any more than change what you had for breakfast . It hasn 't happened . It has will have going to have happened , happened but it hasn 't actually happened , happened yet , actually . Poppycock . It will be happened , it shall be going to be happening , it will be wasn 't , could - will have been taken place in the future . Simple as that . You bucket 's been kicked , baby . - Says you . - Says me and Albert Einstein . Albo and I agree on this one - the Theory of Relativity . All right . OK . OK . Right . The Cat broke his tooth in a future echo , right ? - If I can stop him ... - Can 't be done . - I can stop me from dying . - Can 't be done . How would a cat break his tooth ? By eating something ... hard . My robot goldfish ! Eating my robot goldfish . - Holly , where 's the Cat ? - Going into your sleeping quarters , Oh , Smegging Hell ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm back . Feeling good . How am I looking ? Go-oo-od . I wish I was someone else , then I could kiss me . I think I 'll investigate ... these ! No . I just ate . Well , one little fishy ... # Yeah , yeah , I 'm gonna eat you , little fishy ... # I 'm gonna eat you , little fishy # Oh-eeh-oh ... Yeah , I got you ! I 'm gonna ... errgh . I got the fish , I 'm not gonna die . I 'm not gonna die . Crazy monkey ! You creased my suit . My tooth ! My tooth ! I think I 've lost my tooth . Lister , allow me to be the first to offer my commiserations . You 're really loving this , aren 't ya ? " Death isn 't the handicap it used to be in the olden days " ! " It doesn 't screw your career up in the way it used to " ! Right . There 's always some good in every situation . Absolutely . You are about to do the largest splits in your life . - I get blown up , then ? - Bits of you do . It 's not fair . There 's loads of things I 've never done . Like ... I 've never had a prawn vindaloo . And I 've never read ... a book . And I wanted to have a family . And loads of practise on the things you 've to do to get a family . Holly , I 'd like to send an internal memo . Black border . Begins : " To Dave Lister , " condolences on your passing away . " What 's that poem ? " Now , weary traveller , " rest your head , for just like me , you 're utterly dead . " Emergency , Emergency , There 's an emergency going on , - What is it , Hol ? - There 's an emergency , Dave , The navicomp 's overheating , I need your help in the Drive Room , - Oooh-ooh-ooh . - Come in 169 , your time is up . - OK . What was I wearing ? - That jacket and red Tee shirt . You said yourself I can 't stop it . Let 's get it over with . Lister , what 's that for ? I 'm going out as I came in , screaming and kicking . You can 't whack Death on the head . If he comes near me , I 'm gonna rip his nipples off . It can 't cope with the influx of data at light speed , Dave , Hook it up to the drive computer for me ? Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... Aaaaaaaaaah ! One ... I did it ! I 'm not going to die . - Aaaaaaaaaah ! - Aaaaaaaah . Dog attack . - Why are you so chirpy . - I 'm alive . For how long ? It may happen tomorrow . - Maybe it won 't happen at all . - I saw it . I 'm sure it was you . Hello , Dave . This is me . I mean you . I mean , I am you . This is you aged 171 , Dave . I know you 're there , because when I was your age , I saw me at my age telling you what I 'm about to tell you , and you 've got to tell you , when you get to be me . - I 'm glad you 've got your marbles . - Shhhhh ! I 've got to tell you about Bexley . - Who 's Bexley ? - I wanted to call my second son " Bexley " , - after Jim Bexley Speed . - Your second son ? - What about your first son ? - Jim ! After Jim Bexley Speed . It wasn 't you Rimmer saw in the Drive Room , it was Bexley . Rimmer , you saw me son die ! Never mind this tott ! What about me , old man ? What happens to me ? Do I become an officer ? I 'm to have two sons ! Fantastic . - But one dies . - Everybody dies . You 're born , you die . The middle bit is " life " , and that 's still to come . Get your camera . You haven 't much time . Get your camera and run to the medical unit . Run ! What about me ? What happens ? He can 't hear us , he 's from the future . Ah , if I ask you now , you can remember it , and when you 're him , and you can tell me . Boss thinking ! Rimmer , you wanted to know what happened to you . - Come closer , come closer still . - Yes . Yes . - Heh , heh , heh . - You goit . No , you goit . I 'm surrounded by goits . Holly , you 're a goit . - I 'm a what ? - You heard ! What 's happening , Hol ? Are we going to see my funeral ? The faster we go , the more into the future the future echoes are , And now , since we 've started to slow down , the future echoes are nearer to the present , Clear ? - No . - Tough , Wait a mi nute . I don 't understand how you 're supposed to get two sons , - without a woman on the ship . - Neither do I. It 'll be a laugh finding out . I can 't see you , but I know you can see me . I 'd like you to meet your two sons . This is Jim and this is Bexley . Stop crying and say " cheese " , boys . # It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere . # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly , far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

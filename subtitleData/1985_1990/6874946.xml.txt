What ? What 's the matter with you ? Are you nuts ? Get our gear ! No , no , no , not again ! I 've been chasing you for weeks ! Stay put for five minutes , will you ? Who are you ? Look in the back pocket ! Wallet ! Seymour McGillis , private investigator ? Is this the way you treat a guy bringing you good news ? What do you mean good news ? How about letting me up ? Sometimes I gotta ask myself why I ever got into this profession . Alright ! I 'm gonna reach into my pocket , for a paper , OK ? Are you ? Scott Hayden ? That depends . And your foster parents were Kent and Eileen Lockhart ? Maybe . Hey kid , I 'm trying to get some answers here . What is this about ? Let me see your neck . Come on . Come on . Yeah , I guess you 're the right Scott Hayden . Right for what ? it 's an address in California . Is this a joke or something ? That , my suspicious friend , is your ticket to ten grand ! Ten grand ... what ? Dollars ? Ten thousand big ones ! You 're the beneficiary of your foster parents insurance policy . Ten thousand dollars ? Where is this ten grand ? That address there is Kent Lockhart 's sister , she the executrix of this state Go see her . I 'm glad this is over , Kid , I 've been chasing you all over the map ! Why do you move around so much anyway ? We like to see new things . Now you can head straight for the moon . By the way , when I was knocking just now , who were you expecting ? Al Capone ? Well , erm ... He got himself involved with a married woman , you know how it is . No , but I wish I did ! Well , good luck , kid , enjoy your inheritance . Just don 't spend it all in one place . Ten thousand dollars . A married woman ? I 'm sorry , OK ? It 's the first thing that came to mind ! - Thank you ! - Thanks ! I 'm getting my learner 's permit pretty soon . We can get two cars ! Red one for me and a blue one for you . Maybe we should use the money to send you to college ! OK , you can have the red one ! This gotta be it ! I 've seen pictures of farms before , I 've never been on a real one . Well , there 's farms and ... farms , I guess . There 's a horse , but I don 't see the farm . Let 's follow that guy . Come on . Come on . Hello ! Hello ! What 's the matter ? You 've never seen a horse before ? I 've never been this close to one . They 're bigger than I thought . Are you Antonia Weyburn ? No , I 'm Samantha . I imagine Antonia is up at the house . Does she , erm ... work up there or something ? Or something . May I help you ? I 'm Paul Forrester . We 're looking for Antonia Weyburn . I 'm Mitchell , and you must be Scott Hayden . We 've been expecting you . This way . If you would wait here , gentlemen , Mrs Weyburn will be with you in a minute . Do you know who that was ? Yeah , that was Mitchell . That was a real life butler . Antonia Weyburn ? I guess not . I wonder what she does here . I mean , my foster parents never talked about her . I hope she works in the kitchen , cos I am starving . A guest in my home never starves . You 're ... . Antonia Weyburn . Hello ! Scott ! Hello and welcome ! Good Heavens ! You are beautiful ! Or should I say handsome ? Let me have a better look at you . I cannot believe my independent brother , never sent me another photograph of you , He knew I loved children . I 'm Scott 's father . - Paul ... - Forrester ! Of course . How lovely to meet you . It 's lovely to meet you too ! Are you the one that has Scott 's ten grand ? Blunt ... Aren 't we ? Never mind , I respect respect someone who comes straight to the point . And I ... expected no less from you . Why don 't we discuss the details after dinner , shall we ? You must be exhausted after your long journey . I feel fine really ... . Oh but you feel even better after you have freshened up . I guess so , yeah . Mitchell will see you to your rooms . Very good , Madam . If there 's nothing else , gentlemen . Dinner will be served promptly at 8 , and you needn 't dress . If I may put a small flea in your ear , punctuality is in order . Madam runs , as they say , a tight ship . This place is really something . Well , there are farms and there are farms , I guess . We 'd better get out of these clothes , I am hungry . What do you mean ? You heard what Mitchell said . We needn 't dress ! Erm , Dad ... I think what he was talking about ... Ha , ha , ha , ha ... What 's the matter ? You 've never seen an artichoke before ? I 've never realized how complicated they are ! That 's because you never stood next to one ! Oh , Samantha , You have a full day tomorrow , I think you would want a clear head . Yeah , tell me ... Your mother takes very good care of you , doesn 't she ? Oh , she 's not really my mother . Everybody just thinks she is , I guess because she treats me like a daughter . How did you manage your education , traveling as much as you do ? Ermm , Well , you know how it is ... Whenever , I have a job that keeps us in one place for a while , then , Scott goes to school . Oh ! I see . An interesting concept . But , then you have an unusual life , haven 't you , Mr Forrester ? Everyone 's life is interesting and unusual , don 't you think ? You 're too modest . The romantic photographer dashing from adventure to adventure , one step ahead of ... whatever ... A perfect life for a child , Is it not ? My late husband had a weakness for Renoir , now , this little landscape , it 's terribly overbid , of course . But Leonard could be quite ruthless when he wanted something . How about you , Mr Forrester ? I never saw a Renoir I didn 't like . I expected you to have a photographer 's eye for great art , I think all of this stuff is great . Well , so do I ! Yeah which , do you think is my favourite ? If you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to say my good night to now , I have a lot of work I need to get done and ... Oh , Sam , I was hoping , well , didn 't you tell me you played tennis ? Ahmm , Yeah , a little , I 'm not very good . I 'm sure Samantha will give you a good game , won 't you , dear ? Oh , if you have the time ? Of course ! Great ! Oh , I 'm sorry , I didn 't see it , I didn 't mean to break it . My son has a lot of energy . Run along , Scott . There are tennis clothes in your room . Sorry , ermm ... Good night . It was an accident , he didn 't mean to break it . It 's alright . Fortunately , it wasn 't an important piece . Quite right , Madam . There 's another just like it , in the loo , if I 'm not mistaken . Mitchell ... Children are like young horses , they need space to ... run and jump and grow ... Scott is no different . Are we going to discuss the details now ? Why not ? It will not take long . Shall we go to the library ? Please ... Did you enjoy the dinner ? Yes , very much , thank you . Good ! I will be brief . I will give you then thousand dollars , and yo will leave . Yes , I know . We plan to . No , not we , you . You are going to leave . What do you mean ? I know all about you , Mr Forrester , I have had you investigated up-down and inside-out . What I mean is , Scott is going to stay here with me , and there is nothing you can do about it . I will keep Scott here , with me , and raise him as he should be raised . You can 't do that ! I raise him as he should be raised . It 's why I 'm here , he 's my son ! Ah , but is he ? Can you prove it ? From what I understand , Scott 's father was A Wisconsin house painter named Hayden . I don 't have to prove it to anyone , except Scott , he knows I 'm his father , and that 's all that matters . Well then , perhaps you can explain , why he prefers the name Hayden ? Why doesn 't he call himself Scott Forrester ? His mother . He likes Hayden because his real mother ... . I know all about her too . She made her decision a long time ago . Now it is your turn . Shall we ... drop the pretense , Mr Forrester ? What kind of father would subject a child to your kind of life ? Ruthless ? Moving from place to place ? Never a chair to settle down and having a normal life meeting God knows what kind of people ? This sort of life is with me . What kind of person would separate a father from his son ? We don 't need your money . Think about Scott , for once . Look around you , can you offer him any of this ? I can offer him me . He doesn 't need any of this . Really ? Will you send him to the right schools ? Will you see that he meets the best people ? Will you give him the security and stability that I will ? Think about that , Mr Forrester . Great ! Now relax ! - It hurts . - It 's supposed to hurt . Don 't worry , after a while it won 't . Keep your back steady , keep you back ... Chin up ! Chin up ! Great , you look good , you look great , come on . Good boy . You look great . It 's kind of like riding a bicycle . Without the middle bar . Keep your heels down . I need to talk to Scott . Sure ! OK ! Whoa ! Whoa ! You only bought a one ride ticket . My little boy ... You looked great though ! Samantha says you 're a natural rider . She 's just being nice . No ! She means it . You like it here , don 't you ? Sure ! It 's great ! I mean ... After breakfast this morning , Mitchell asked me to tell him what I wanted for lunch . Like he 'd make anything I wanted . And if they didn 't have it here , then they 'd go to the city to get it . Is that luxury or what ? You 'd like to stay here , wouldn 't you ? Sure , who wouldn 't but how could we ? I meant that you 'd stay . What do you mean that I 'd stay ? What about you ? I 'd have to leave . That 's crazy ! Who told you that ? Antonia Weyburn . Whoa ! That 's crazy ! You go , I go ! I 'm not staying anywhere without you . You about the life you 'd have . She can give you a lot more than I can . Is that what you want ? Are you trying to get rid of me ? What do you think ? Besides , how long do you think you 'd last without me to take care of you ? Is that what you do ? Are you kidding ? Let 's go get our stuff , and you wanna know something else ? This jacket , it scratches and it 's itchy . Yes , operator , A person to person call to a Mr George Fox ? Yes . I understand . Miss Weyburn , the main thing , now , the main thing is to keep them off-guard , Wiley ? He ... He 's unpredictable , I consider that dangerous . Miss Weyburn , could you hold on just one moment , please ? Wiley ! Ah , please let me assure you , you are doing the right thing . Your country will thank you , as will I , No , no ! We 'll be there ! We 'll be there in less than two hours . We 'll go south . Tag along the coast . We got along without ten grand before , we 'll manage , Huh ? We 'll find you a jacket , just like that one . Nahhh ! It 's not my style ! Besides , I kind of like yours . Come in ! We 're going now . Both of us . Yes , I know . That is why I 'm here . I was stupid and inconsiderate , to say what I did last night . Please , accept my apology . We 're still going . I understand . And I , I don 't blame you . But ... my brother left you 10000 dollars ... We don 't need it . Well , now you are being silly , It would take a day , two at the most ! Won 't you please , stay here ? I acted reprehensibly , But whether you believe me or not , I was only thinking of Scott 's welfare . Let me make it up to you . OK . We 'll stay , thank you . Thank you , I was wrong . I am so glad . You wanted me to say yes , don 't you ? Maybe on second thought , I ... that jacket isn 't so scratchy . Reinaldo ? Take the gelding for a long walk . Be sure no one sees you . Sí , señora . Well , my mother died when I was about five so , my father married another woman . I guess to take care of me ... Anyway , she and I never got along from the very beginning , so , I never really had a mother that I remember . And we never really had anything , so , I feel very lucky to be here . What about your parents ? Oh , they were ... all energy ! Having things , is that lucky ? Now , look around you . Yeah , this is all very comfortable , I mean ... anything you want , food or clothing , money for rent , but ... Tell me about the paintings , and the vases , You 'd have to ask Antonia about that . She and her husband were avid collectors , you know . I don 't think she enjoys the paintings and the vases . I think you 're wrong . What 's this ? That 's an iris . That is beautiful . I would collect these ! I think it 's interesting the way you react to things . It 's like ... everything you see is brand new . It is I think everyone should look at it that way . I 've noticed there are people who look but they don 't see what they 're looking at . Ah ! There you are ! I 've been looking for you . I 'm worried about Scott . He 's in the game room . I 'm afraid not . He said he wanted to go for a trail ride , Reinaldo set out the gelding for him , I don 't think he were wise , I didn 't know anything about it . I 'll go find him . I wish you would . We 'll both go ! Do you ride ? Like riding a bicycle , only no handle-bars . We 'll find him . Are you sure you 've ridden before ? Not horses ! There ! See ? There 's nothing to it . Let 's go . Ma 'am ? Ah ! Is Scott still in the game room ? Playing billiards , Ma 'am . When he finishes , take him to the kitchen . get him a sandwich or something , but keep him occupied for a while . Yes , Ma 'am . There 's no sign of him . Do you think he could have gone in another direction ? No , this is the only open country way out here . We 'll keep looking then , You alright ? Most of me is , yes . Martin , upstairs . Wiley , down . - Mr Fox ? - Yes ! Miss Weyburn ? Yes ! Where is he ? I beg your pardon ? Forrester ! Where is he ? I sent him for a ride . If you have said not to alert him , to act normally , Yes . Or course . Ahm ... Your house is beautiful Thank you . I will be so glad when this is over . It is very upsetting , and I am sure Scott 's going to be very upset too . The boy is here ? Yes ! He 's in the kitchen . He 's such a charming young man , who deserves more out of life , Once he 's living here with me , I will make sure , he forgets his unnatural life with Mr Forrester . Wiley ! Wiley ... The boy Scott is here , he 's in the kitchen , which is ... where ? Down the hall . Make sure he 's alright . Your office in Washington was rather vague about what Mr Forrester did . Yes , I know . Believe me , I know . Now , he 's come in through here ? Yes . What exactly is Mr Forrester wanted for ? I 'm afraid I have to be just as vague as my office , Ma 'am , and frankly , you wouldn 't wanna know . Are there any other entrances to his house besides the usual ones ? No . Oh . Would you like some tea ? Tea ? Ah ... . I don 't think so . Thank you . We 'll just wait . What are you doing ? We need to give them a rest a few minutes . They 're not trail maps , they 're not used to any of this . I know how they feel . Good boy ! There you go ! I also feel uneasy . I wouldn 't worry about him , I 'm sure he 's fine . So long as he remembers what he learned , he 's a natural ! I don 't think he could 've ridden this far . Yeah , it 's possible . If it gets dark , I wanna keep looking . Horses don 't come with headlights . They don 't even like to move in the dark . I was tried to jump a horse at night and I would never do it again . I went over the hedge , the horse didn 't . Something is not right . I feel it . This is all new to him . Servants and , horses and , tennis courts . Could have fooled me . He really made himself at home fast . Antonia wants to keep him . She wants him to stay here . Really ? She says he 'll be better off here . Than where ? Than with me . She wants him to stay alone . Antonia said that ? I don 't believe it . Oh ! I think you 're one of those people that looks and doesn 't see . She wants to keep him here so she can ... keep him under control the way she has you under control . What control ? Everything you do ! Where you go and when you go , and when you eat , when you sleep , That isn 't true ! Antonia 's wonderful to me . As long as you what she wants . That 's just like any other parent , She 's not your parent , she 's your employer . That 's not true . Listen , I don 't know what it is that you 're getting at , but I don 't like it . Not one bit . I 'm sorry I blew out . I understand . I guess I have a way of saying things that , make people uncomfortable . Well , we 'll find him . Let 's get started . No , we won 't . He 's not out here . He never was . Now , what 's that supposed to mean ? Scott never went for a ride ! Antonia wanted me away from the house . What for ? I don 't know . You tell me . Whose idea was it ? Yours or Antonia ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Antonia wouldn 't do anything like that . All that paranoid nonsense . We 're going back . OK . Mr Fox ! Are you out of your mind ? Tell your men to let him go immediately now ! Sorry , Ma 'am , find a secure room and lock him in this time ! You knew this ? You called them ? - I don 't believe you ! - Take him out ! What do you think you are doing ? This is my home and you cannot come in here and start acting like storm-troopers . Ma 'am , I 'm here at your invitation , which invitation was not to a tea party . And it was not for the boy ! No comment ! He could not possibly have done anything to interest the government ... No comment ! Isn 't the truth , that it 's Mr Forrester you really want and the boy is just your bait to catch him ? Mrs Weyburn , You 're not gonna get anything out of me and the sooner you realize that , the less painful this is gonna be for everyone . Now , we will be out of your life as soon as Mr Forrester returns . Paul ! There are people in the house holding my son , they want me very much The next time you see Antonia Weyburn , ask her why she sent us on that ride . I think you 're wrong . Let me out ! Samantha ! Where is Mr Forrester ? Who are these people ? What 's going on ? Where is he young lady ? He was right ! You lied to me ! You used me ! - Wiley ! - Samantha ! Will you stop this ? I will talk to her ! I know her and she will tell me ! She better ! He 's somewhere on this property and he 's not going to leave without his son , we will get him Samantha , wait ! I 'm not interested in anything you have to say . Listen , please . What ? You 're crying ! I 'm just angry at myself for believing in you . You used me ! I thought you really cared ! I always thought of you as the mother I never knew ... - Oh , my dear ... - Don 't dear me ! I 'm not dear or anything to you , I know that now . I 'm just an employee . I train your horses and I do what I 'm told and if that 's the way it 's going to be , fine ! But from now on if you want me to stay , you 're going to pay me a salary , just like the rest of your employees , and what I do after working hours is my own business , and that includes when I go to bed and when I get up and I will buy my own sweaters , thank you . It may not be cashmere but at least I won 't have to kiss your green powder hole . I checked the kitchen ! Then check it again ! I don 't wanna find you sitting down anymore , I want you to check all the rooms again . What are you going to do ? They do not want Scott , they want you . Shall I call them ? Or will you do the decent thing and give yourself up ? If I do , we 'll both lose Scott . - Have it your way . - No wait , please . Take me somewhere safe where we can talk , and then , if you still feel the same way , Alright . Follow me . Before you say anything , Mr Forrester , please , for one time in your life , put someone else 's welfare before your own . I do not know what kind of trouble you are in , but if you give yourself up , I guarantee we 'll have the best law firm in this country to defend you . and , whatever happens , I will make sure that Scott has everything he could ever want , or need . including love . It 's not that simple . My God ! What could be so terrible to face that you would risk that boy 's future ? Sit down , Mrs Weyburn . Please . I 'm going to tell you why it 's not so simple . My giving myself up , won 't guarantee Scott 's freedom . You see , you 're wrong . George Fox wants us both , and not for anything that we did but for who we are . I 'm not Paul Forrester . I borrowed his body . Do you think I am a complete fool ? Scott knows this is the truth . Of course he believes it ! Far off galaxies ? Map maker of the universe ? Cloning bodies from drops of blood ? This is a young man 's fantasy . Something he sees on television or in the movies , You 're making a joke of something that 's real . You are worse , than irresponsible . Now , more than ever I am determined to take Scott from you . Scott is my son ! Half of him is me ! If we 're captured , there 's no future for either one of us . Even if they let us live , they 'll keep us locked up for the rest of our lives ! George Fox is a hunter . He 's a man with an obsession . He thinks that we 're dangerous but you know that we 're not , Mrs Weyburn . You can sense that . Really , Mr Forrester ? You don 't believe me . Not one word . What are you going to do ? A favour ! I don 't believe when you care for Scott . I think he 's like this vase to you , to own to show , to display ... But when he breaks , Mrs Weyburn I won 't be there to out him back together . Not a ... crack ! No . Not a crack . It ... was a trick . You know it wasn 't . No , no , no , you call me when he gets back . Yes , thank you . Good-bye . Mrs Weyburn . Where is he ? You know where he is . I have a proposition for you . I will deliver Paul Forrester in return for Scott Hayden . But without tricks . You realize you 're liable for prosecution ? Take it ... or leave it . Ha , ha , ha ... What can I say ? Except that you 're swimming in deep and dangerous waters . Is that a yes ? That is a yes . There is one condition . I do not trust you . You have lied to me once already . The exchange will be done my way ! I have Paul Forrester , you want him . You have Scott Hayden , I want him . We will determine neutral ground , like the East-West bridge in Berlin , Ha , ha , ha . Each will start walking , at the same time , crossing in the middle . Agreed ? Agreed . I 'm cold . Yeah . It 's almost time . I can 't believe Fox agreed to go through with this exchange . Well , he did . An indication of how badly he wants you . I wish there was another way to do this . You agreed it was the only way . I know . Scott . He 'll be fine . There he is , Mr Fox . What 's going on ? Who 's over there ? Dad ? What 's going on ? What are you doing ? It 's called a little midnight swap , mate . Don 't do it ! Don 't trust him ! Run ! Run ! Go on ! Don 't answer . He 'll be fine . Are we ready ? Yes . OK ! Start him walking . Wait there ! Where 's Forrester ? Here . I 'm right here . Alright . Start walking . Slow ! The word is slowly . It 's an adverb . When you get Forrester , I 'll get the kid . Right . Will you be staying the night , Sir ? You double-crossed me . Oh ! And that was your move , wasn 't it ? I 'm so sorry . It 's not over , Madam , you can bet the farm on that . Faster ! Whoa ! We gotta jump it . They won 't jump in the dark . - Sorry ! - What the hell ... ? Well , that 's us here ! Even your jacket ! We did it ! My God ! We did it ! You know , someone could let me in on it . I mean , as soon I reached the middle there and saw who was coming at me , I thought I was gonna die ! It 's a good thing Mitchell thought fast and gave you a hug . Well , a natural gesture under the circumstances . Are you going to be alright ? Oh ! Absolutely ! I have my own resources . Besides , I doubt Mr Fox would want this story circulated around the Official Washington How about you two ? Your ride ought to take a toll . Oh , I 'm fine ! Yeah , me too ! I 'm fine ! Well , we 'd better go now . Take care of yourself , and of Scott . Good-bye . Bye , bye ! He never did say why they were chasing him . Oh , ermm , he told me ! He did ? Yes , it is taxes , dear .

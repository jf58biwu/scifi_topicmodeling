[ intense music ] Tell you what , Zeke , I 've never been hit so hard in my life . I got to get a X-Ray this morning . I think it 's busted . And you 're absolutely sure it was Superboy ? - Positive . - I just don 't understand . Why would Superboy steal half a million dollars worth of diamonds ? The kid 's strong enough to compress coal and make his own . Are you calling me a liar ? All I 'm saying is that you could be mistaken . He was wearing Superboy 's outfit . Yeah , maybe you were hit so hard , you 're hallucinating . Who else could melt open a vault like that ? I just can 't believe it . It was hard for me to believe too . But one thing 's for sure , nobody , not even Superboy is above the law . ( male on intercom ) Yes , lieutenant ? Put out an APB on Superboy . ( male # 1 ) We 're opening the doors in five minutes , everyone . Five minutes , let 's go . [ T.J. chuckling ] I can 't believe . You 're wasting your film . We 're only gonna run the picture of Ms. Jennifer Jenkins because that 's who we 're doing the story on . I know . These are for my wall . I 've never seen these many beautiful girls in all my life . And that includes my dreams . Miss , uh , Ms. Jenkins ? Hi , we 're here to do a story on you cause you once went to Shuster . Actually , he 's doing the story , I 'm taking the pictures . And , uh , a picture 's worth a thousand words , right ? So , um , say cheese and T.J. White 's my kinda guy . It 's nice to meet you both . What would you like to know ? Uh , well , um .. What 's your favorite , um .. What 's the word I 'm looking for ? I 'm sorry . Um .. Do you surf ? What do you like to do ? God , this is , uh .. Stay on the floor and keep your heads down . Okay , move . They must 've hit the alarm by now . [ alarm ringing ] [ tires screeching ] - TJ ... your hair is on fire . - Yeah . Spaced out , over Miss Florida , huh ? She is pretty though , isn 't she ? Yeah . Let 's see what 's going on in the real world . ( dispatch on radio ) Suspect vehicle is headed east on Ninth . Unit 36 has made contact and is in pursuit .

And I say they 're chicken . [ upbeat music ] First you drive us off the road . And now you save our lives . No time for explanations , gentlemen . I 've got some unfinished business to attend to . You 're not going anywhere , Superboy . You 're under arrest for armed robbery . [ intense music ] Why , Superboy ? Why did you do it ? If I were guilty , why would I let them bring me in ? I don 't know , but we have some witnesses that place you at the scene of both crimes . Did they say I flew or used any of my superpowers ? Did I bend steel with my hands ? There are some indications of that . Lieutenant , someone is impersonating me committing serious crimes , I 've got to find them . Look , I know , no jail will hold you against your will . I want your word that you won 't break out . I won 't . Let me out on my own recognizance . I-I can 't . Look . The department 's been under attack and , uh ... they 're saying that we are soft on crime . Lieutenant . Armed robbery is a serious charge . For anybody else , we 'd set bail at 10,000 . I 'll talk to the DA and make it 500 for you . Where am I gonna get $ 500 ? Can I make a phone call ? [ indistinct chatter ] Thank you . [ telephone ringing ] - Hello ? - Clark Kent , please . Uh , he 's not here . This is T.J. , uh , who 's calling ? Superboy . Yeah , yeah , right . And I 'm Robert Redford . I haven 't got time for games . I got some pictures developing . So , who is this ? Did Robert Redford save you from being crushed in a junkyard ? Oh , gee , Superboy , um .. I-I don 't know where Clark is . I 'm looking for him myself actually . T.J. , I need your help . I 'm down at police headquarters and there 's been a little misunderstanding . I need to borrow some money for bail . You need to be bailed out of jail ? It 's a long story . I 'll tell you about it when you 're here . Right . Four hundred and fourty , 460 , 480 , 500 . Can 't thank you enough , Lana . Well , it 's about time I saved you . You 've saved me often enough . I 'm just glad I had the money . I am too . Superboy , we could use your help . Thanks again . If we could find the car the perpetrators used we could find them . You read my mind , Lieutenant . You know , I haven 't seen Clark all day . Yeah , I 'm gonna lay a bomb on him . Now what did he do ? He left me chasing a spare tire into the lake and then when I finally did catch up to him , I .. Jennifer Jenkins . I , I bet you he 's down at the civic pretending he 's doing a follow up on our story . - Do you wanna come ? - No , thanks . Beauty pageants aren 't my thing . But you can drop me off at the library . [ audience clapping ] Ladies and gentlemen , as our pageant draws to a close it is time to announce our three finalists . But , ladies , I want you to know that whoever our queen is in my book , you are all winners . The three finalists are .. ... Miss Georgia . [ audience clapping ] Miss Alabama . [ audience clapping ] And Miss Florida . [ audience applauding ] [ upbeat music ] [ birds chirping ] Police headquarters . Thanks , Susan . This is wonderful . [ indistinct chattering ] Jennifer ? Hugo , why you dressed as Superboy ? Why . Don 't you remember ? You said you were crazy about him . Oh , come on , that was a fantasy crush . Like on a movie star . You wanted Superboy , now you got him . Hugo , why don 't you leave me alone . You promised to marry me if I came up with a million dollars . Where would you get a million dollars ? Don 't underestimate me . We 're getting married and a deal 's a deal . I wouldn 't marry you if you had all the money in the world ! Put me down ! [ upbeat music ] Put me down ! I got a great place across the river . [ intense music ] Hey ! Hugo ! Aah ! Hugo , let me .. Aah ! Now don 't you move . [ music continues ] [ upbeat music ] [ music continues ] - T.J. , what happened ? - I 'm alright . I 'm okay . Um , that Super .. that phony Superboy slugged me . But he took Jennifer . I heard him say he was taking her somewhere across the river . How long ago ? Uh , 15-20 minutes . Don 't be a hero . Let him take care of you . [ upbeat music ] Hey , Rudy , give me a hand , will ya ? Just a second , I don 't wanna lose my place . Get outta the van , sweetheart . You 'd better let me go . Better take me back if you know it 's good for you . Hey , Rudy , watch her for me . I 'm gonna go find a minister . [ upbeat music ] [ intense music ] [ metallic clanging ] [ music continues ] [ upbeat music ] Where are you hiding Jennifer ? That 's for me to know and for you to find out . That 's not hard . Running around impersonating me has gone to your head . Sure , big deal . With your superhuman powers , of course , it isn 't a fair fight . But if you fought without ' em , a plain fight , man to man that 'd be another story . - That could be arranged . - You serious ? You won 't use any of your superpowers ? Not one , I promise . ( Hugo ) This is gonna be fun . [ clang ] Ah-ha-ho-ho ! You expected a glass jaw ? [ clang ] Ah-ha-ho-ho ! Or feet of clay ? Help ! Superboy . I gave you my word , I wouldn 't use any superpowers . I release you . You 'll tell me where Jennifer is ? Anything ! Superboy ! Superboy ! Save me ! Help ! ( Superboy ) Lieutenant , you 're not seeing double . This imposter will be more than happy to sign a full confession to the crimes committed in my name . Right , Hugo ? And then exchange his Superboy costume for another one . Something with grey stripes would be appropriate . Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention please . The winner of the Southeastern beauty pageant is Miss Florida . But , unfortunately , she is not present . Now , contest rules specify that if the winner is unavailable to accept , the prize goes to the runner up who in this case is , Miss .. [ indistinct chatter ] Thanks for the lift , Superboy . [ audience clapping ] [ audience cheering ] [ upbeat music ] Excuse me , pardon me , pardon me . Excuse me , pardon me . Hey , hey , ho-ho . Excuse me . Pardon me . Oh , sorry . [ upbeat music ] Pardon me . Forgive me . - Oh ! God . Sorry . - Oh . I 'm ... I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . - Anytime . - Okay . What did I miss ? Everything , as usual . [ music continues ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

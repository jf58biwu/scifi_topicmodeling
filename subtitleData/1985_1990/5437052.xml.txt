Translation by Jimbakyu Sync by mihai _ osky Marian HAVE A FIGHT AND BE HAPPY Haa .. ! What a beautiful sunset ! This planet has 3 suns , which makes everyone look red and like an octopus . Octopus is you , Rana ... So , we 're camping out tonight again ... [ TAKO = octopus ; moron ] Oh .. ! Excuse me ! I 'd like to ask you something . Hmm .. ! Hey ! They don 't speak Earth language , do they ? Sibip , be an interpreter please ! Roger pepo . # $ % # $ % , % # ' $ $ % . Hi .. haha .. This man looks like a real octopus . Shhh .. ! That 's rude ! Doesn 't matter , he doesn 't understand Earth language after all .. $ % # $ % $ $ % # % $ % # $ $ % # . The way your mouth sticks out , and how red you are , you look like a real boiled octopus . Yes , people always say that to me in the evening . Yes , as I thought .. Ho .. ! Oh .. ! ... you just spoke .. ! My name is " FURU " . It seems you 're looking for a place to stay tonight , so , why don 't you stay in my house if you like ? It 's a shabby house in " KAMERE " village , just over there . But not living in octopus trap or something .. Ha .. haa .. ha .. ! A missionary ? About 20 years ago , a father called " YAKOPE " , from Earth came to this village for propagation . We were living like primitives , but the Father taught us technology and language of Earth , and the belief in God . - Amen ! - Amen ! Amen ! Amen ! What a commendable man to do missionary work and come from such a remote place like Earth . Maybe just relegated or something , huh ? Can 't be , he 's not , Rana ! What ? ! You long-necked giraffe ! That 's the pride of our village . Father YAKOPE 's church . Oh , our dear Father who reside in heaven , hopefully you cherish us all . Please listen to my appeals , dear Father , give peace of mind to suffering sheep . Oh , dear Father , lend your ears to this prayer with your compassion : People , stop making vain offences indefinitely . Lord , take Father 's voice .. objection and argument are out of question . Behave yourself taking others into consideration as to what brings peace . Remove self-assertion and say one word , " Amen " . Then , an enormous rejoice shall come when desire foods . All say Amen . Haa ... ! .. when you have warm clothes ... Sibip ! " give him Amen " - Sibip ! " give him Amen " - Sibip ! Sibip ! ... feeling cold ... Ha .. ! What 's the matter ? Apologies , Father ! I took travellers from Earth ... Oh ... . .. from Earth ... ! When I came here 20 years ago , no one believed in God , and I was treated as a liar . But people gradually started to believe , one by one . Now , all villagers are faithful followers . What about that church ? Built with villagers ' cooperation . Free of charge ? .. ouch .. Small ... .. but very lovely church ! Is that a graveyard ? Yes . Thanks to our Father , there 's no fighting or crime in this village anymore . Respecting God makes humans honest . Haa .. aaa ... . ! What happened ? Hey ! Giraffe ! Ha .. aaa ... .. th ... th .. this ... .... .. of .. of Anne .. .. Prof. Anne .. " Professor Anne " Professor Anne ? ! Prof. Anne ? Can 't be ! Aaa .. aaaa ... .. Do you know Prof. Anne ? Yes , we 've been travelling in search of Prof. Anne . Such name as Anne is very common ... .. this must be a different person . Of course .. .. it must be ! I wish it was so .. About 3 days ago , a young lady was found collapsed at the entrance of the village and died soon afterwards . She was an intelligent and beautiful woman ! Oh .. oh .. ohh ... ! The cause of death was excessive fatigue , and her name was identified by embroidery on her clothes . Can that lady ... .. never .. .never ... Uhh ... . Uh .. Give it back ! Stop kidding ! You worthless priest ! To tell me Anne died ! Liar ! Just die ! I 'm gonna kill you ! Giraffe ! Calm down , calm down ! Father , I 'm really sorry about that ! I 'm Ok .. It 's very unfortunate .. You , Misters , really came from Earth ? " RIN " , be quiet and a good girl ! Misters are all tired . Yes .. Sorry , she 's still a little girl ! Ha .. Thank you for the meal . Eh .. Never expected such an outcome ... What we 're gonna do ? Hmm .. Wait until Giraffe 's feelings subside , and then go back to Earth .. You may stay here as long as you like . And there 's more soup left . No thank you , I 'm full . How about you ? Some more ? My heart is full .. How can the husband eat such a salty dish .. ? Indeed , what a patient man .. I don 't know what 's going on ... Oh ? Is it Sibip ? I don 't think so , too clumsy for Sibip , don 't you think ? Giraffe .. Anne used to teach me quite often how to play the guitar in the laboratory garden . Ha .. ha .. No , Giraffe ! C chord is there . Look , your little finger ... Arggh , no good ! You 're so clumsy ... What ? Ha .. haha .. Are you guys the ones who has come from Earth ? I 'm sorry about that lady ... Did Prof. Anne leave any words before passing away ? Not sure .. .. because when she was found she was dead already . Father told that when she was found she was still alive , and died soon afterwards ! Ah ! ... .. that must be then ... Nowadays , I have short memory for I 'm getting older ... Smells suspicious . Suspicious ? That lady seems to be hiding something . Just going senile , isn 't she ? But .. , .. hey .. shall we go see the Father ? See the Father ? I don 't mind , but what about Giraffe ? We should leave him alone for a while ... Sibip , is Ok if the lute ... ? Ok , pepo . Hey . ! Misters ! Hi Rin , are you on an errand ? We 're here to buy some stuff for tonight 's dinner . You 're ok with meat ? Yes , let 's buy meat . Or , would you like fish ? Fish is fine with me as well . I 'll have whatever you 'd like . I 'm just ok with what you like . Let 's have what you want . What would you like ? Huge difference compared to my family . If I say I want steak , " no money " she says . Then I say fish , and she says she doesn 't like it . After all , we end up with convenient pre-cooked fast food . My family 's almost the same , too , Ok , let 's have fish then . Yes . Hello ! Today , we have delicious octopus from " MONGAMA " . I 'll have that one . Yes . I have fresh octopus as well . Hmm .. I might have that one instead ... I leave it to you Mr. fishmonger . No , whichever you like . Well ... please decide for us ! Mutual concession ? Yes . Looking around the village , I 've seen they don 't make any assertions . " what you said " , " what you like " .. from 1 to 10 and A to Z , leave everything to others . I 've been teaching only this thing for the past 20 years . When I departed for propagation , there were wars just everywhere on Earth and big cities were a den for criminals . Things haven 't changed that much from then . Why so ? The reason is simple . It 's because people only makes assertions , and never care about others . By the way , do you know the meaning of " Amen " ? Amen means " That 's right " . This word embodies God 's wisdom . Even suppress yourself , if you respect others with " that 's right " , fightings or wars can never happen . No crimes as well . Suppressing yourself leads to letting yourself live in the end . I wish my wife were listening to this . By the way , there is something I 'd like to ask you about Prof. Anne 's death . Ha .. haha .. Mrs. " Ashoka " , a grandma of the square , right ? Yes . She said Prof. Anne was dead already when she was found . Prof. was still alive when she was found . We carried her to the doctor and nursed her very carefully , but early in the morning the next day , she breathed last time . So , that Mrs. was ... Well , due to her age , she forgets things easily recently . Without leaving any words , she looked as if sleeping in her last moment . Thank you very much .. See you later . Ohh .. Should I tell them the truth ... ? ... No , better not ... It 's best letting them know nothing ... 3 days have passed already since we 've came to this village . Pepo ? Giraffe doesn 't get better at all . I understand his feelings though . Pepo .. Giraffe ! We have fine weather today again . Why don 't you stop confining yourself , and go for a walk for a change ? Ha .. What 's the matter , Rin ? Why you 're crying ? What happened ? Ah .. ! Rin ... Rin ! No ! Ha .. ? Dad and Mum will ... . Yes , dad and mom will ? ... will be separated ! They said they will live apart from each other ! What can I do from now on ? Don 't tell me .. ! Just a while ago , they were conceding and respecting one another ... and now live apart , suddenly .. Ah .. ! As I checked , in this village , there might be no wars and crimes , but instead , there are quite a few cases of couples living apart . Live apart ? As long as they say " Amen " and refrain from self-assertion and stubbornness , there can be no separation , I imagine . Exactly pepo . That 's weird for sure .. Pardon my intrusion , I am the mayor of this village . Ah , nice to meet you . Many thanks for helping Prof. Anne . Not at all ... We couldn 't do much really .. I guess you 're disappointed and saddened . Well , that 's it for our job , so I can now go back home on Earth , and enjoy my favourite dish : lasagna . Me too , I 'll be meeting my newly born baby for the first time . I 'm really looking forward to it . He .. ? Lasagna and baby , you must be looking forward very much . Well , very unfortunate about Prof. Anne , but if such pleasures are waiting for you on Earth , it 's a big consolation at least ! See you later ! Ha .. haha .. What kind of man is he ? Very insensitive , isn 't he ? ! We 've just pretended to be cheerful on purpose in order not to make him worry about us too much . Pepo , pepo ! What consolation was he talking about ? We feel the opposite at the bottom of our hearts . Ha .. ? Totally opposite at the bottom ... Ha .. ! Separation ? Well .. , it is a matter between husband and wife ... If you say " Amen " and make efforts , and yet you can 't get along , it means you two simply don 't get on with each other . There 's nothing to do . Nothing ? Is that really so ? You swear you never forgot about the spirit of Amen , day or night ? We swear , of course ! I see . Then there 's nothing to do about it . Saying Amen too much leads to separation . I cannot help thinking that way . Yo .. you blaspheme against God ? No , not at all ! It might be against Father 's teaching , but today I came here to have them fight as much as they want . Figh .. ? ... ight ? No reason to be surprised like that , they are living apart after all . Not allowed ! Self-assertion is blasphemy against God ! If people start to assert own self , endless wars and fightings would occur . Anyway , Father , today you are an observer . Now , you two , spew out your feelings and fight to your satisfaction ! Fight ? So suddenly , no .. The reason for our separation is that we somehow don 't get on with each other , for no particular reason , ... So , I don 't know what we should fight about . Are you really sure about that ? We , being taken care of at your house , may not have right to say this , but don 't you think KAREN 's soup tastes a bit too salty ? Uhm .. no .. .. not at all .. You 're lying ! You were guzzling water behind Karen after finishing the dish , weren 't you ? My dear , is that right ? ... No way .. Yes . How horrible ! Nowadays , I don 't like salty dishes . I 've been adjusting myself to your taste . That 's your own convenience . How come my cooking is salty .. ? Stop it , you two ! Please remain silent , Father ! Haa .. ! You never wash the cup after brushing teeth ! Toothpaste sticking to a cup ... How dirty ! You should stop wearing wool bottoms when going to bed then ! Not attractive at all ! Because I 'm sensitive to cold ! Why don 't you ever replace empty toilet roll with new one ? How insensitive you are ! What did you say ? How about you then ! You wanna fight ? ! Fine ! Today is the day ! Can 't stand it ! Come off it ! Blasphemy ! Fighting is blasphemy against God ! Forgetting the spirit of Amen ... not only they live apart , but also end up in killing each other ! Isn 't it opposite , don 't you think ? ... What do you mean ? I have quarrels with my wife sometimes , but after a quarrel , we feel refreshed and things go smoother . Even if married , husband and wife are different persons after all . That 's why you should make efforts to understand each other , even if you have to have big fights . Rubbish ! To get along with each other due to fighting is a silly idea ! Ha .. ? Giraffe pepo ! Ah .. ! Prof. Anne , for 3 days , day and night , I 've been practicing to be able to play the tune you used to like . I can 't play it as well as you did . You were a wonderful woman . You had a lot of good points that I don 't . You and me were like water and oil , with very different characters and tastes . No .. because we were different , I 've come to love you so much ! Ha .. ? I 've made up my mind to go back to Earth tomorrow . Eh .. ? Still pretty bad ... .. but this is my last for you ... How nonsensical ... Two of different personalities to love each other .. Because they were different personalities , they loved each other , don 't you think so ? If you suppress yourself and only say " you 're right " , it sure looks like everyone is friendly to each other . However , unless you and others reveal everything , true love and friendship can never happen . The reason there are many cases of couples living apart is because they suppress their own feelings too much ! Sometimes , you need fightings to reveal everything to each other . Ha .. ? You two .. I decided to reduce the amount of salt for the soup . I will also be careful about toilet roll ... .. and we decided to start all over again . Has my teaching been wrong ... ? ! No , it can 't be ... Thank you very much for everything ! - Eh .. - Not at all .. Ha .. Hehe .. hehe ... - Oh .. ! - Father ! I may have been thinking too much trying to avoid conflict . Father ? To get along well because of fighting .. Contradiction might be the proof of being humans ! I 've taken theory into consideration only , and forgot about and left behind the most important .. that is heart , feelings ... I must apologize to you . Follow the loved one even though you know you might die .. ! That might be the real love .. What do you mean ? To tell you the truth , Prof. Anne isn 't dead yet . He ... . ? ! He ... .. ? ! Mt . Ishta is a dangerous , lethal mountain . No one has ever returned alive from the mountain . .. So , every time I meet travellers heading to Mt . Ishta , that means the person is dead . So I 've built graves and held funerals for them . We persuaded Prof. Anne not to go , but she insisted she was to solve the mystery of Mu , and departed for Mt . Ishta nonetheless . " She will never come back , " I thought ... so I 've built a grave for her . But why did you lie to us saying she 's dead ? The lie itself , wasn 't my intention , but you told me that you 're chasing Prof. Anne , so I couldn 't let you die as well ! ... So , .. Prof. Anne is still alive ... Yes .. Go follow her if you love her that much .. Although I can only pray for your safety ... Well , if you have such strong love , you might overcome death , who knows ... ? Ah .. ah .. aaah ... Aah ... pe .. po .. ! No matter how dangerous Mt . Ishta is , Prof. Anne is still alive ! Aah .. aah ... ! I understand , Giraffe ! Hey ! Take care ! Misters ! - Rin ! - Good bye ! Misters ! Be careful ! At least .. it 's a consolation that Rin is happy again , but ... It seems there will never be any consolation for us . All right , let 's go ! Aah ... Pepo !

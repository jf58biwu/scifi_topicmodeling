You help me move some heavy boxes in the freezer And we 'll call it even . you know I don 't like using my powers on the job . hah hah Those wild and crazy scientific guys â€” I love ' em those Misfits ... Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy I need a hit from this excitement In my wildest fantasy I can feel it ! straight from my heart straight from the heart Oooh straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! Billy : Absolutely not Richard . Dick : It 's not a big deal Hayes They simply want the Misfits to pose with them when they cut the ribbon . In our uniforms ? I 'm going to lunch in a minute Dr. Hayes. you have some messages . Who 's she ? Miss . Nance : Message number 1 Do you think that maybe she can wait outside ? Keep her on Ice and I 'll get to her as soon as I can . Richard it 's an endorsement . It 's an appearance . An appearance for the governer . In front of a new nuclear power plant in an election year ? It 's an endorsement for him and his plan . Dick : Oh dear . what the hell 's happening here man ? We were testing the non conductive suits for Johnny Bee and the generator overloaded . Are you working on that overcharged rock and roll .. pull the main circuit breaker fuse . Will ya ? Billy I already Tried . Wanna watch where you 're shooting that thing ? Don 't you gentlenman ever do anything for the company in here ? Call B-man ? Ms. Nance : Uh ten minutes ago . That was message number 2 . Got here as fast as I could What is that thing doing in here . I was rehearsing with the band . Take care of it will ya ? Do you think you could drain some of the juice off this thing ? Does Tina turner sing the blues ? I already set everything off . Everything 's turned off . It 's all turned off . Alright Back off . It 's all yours . What do you think of Johnny B and the Blasters ? Is that a good name for our band ? Already taken B-Man . Come on . Is he insured ? I didn 't mean to take out the lights Sorry guys . Are you ok ? I 'm a little wired ... probably I should go outside and unload a few amps The last message was from Gloria at the Burger barn . Ms. Nance : She said it was an emergency . I think I 'll go check the fusebox . Johnny B and the fuseboxes . No that 's to R and B. not at all B-Man . It 's fine . Why don 't you go out with El and unload some amps . Ok ? Oh Ok . what did Glo say about an emergency ? What was it ? Miss Nance ? You shouldn 't let him have that now . Not out here . Barney has low blood suger . He needs his meat . Yes sir . I think somebody from the FDA oughta be sent down here . No I don 't know who took the delivery . Did you get them ? Yeah . Their on their way . Johnny : You said it was glowing ? home of the glowing green burgers . Is that catchy or what ? There must be some kind of radiation . Johnny : I hope nobody ate one . Anyway I think it would be better for him to eat it somewhere where we could take the weight off his feet . wouldn 't that be better ? We could 've eaten at the burger barn . Oh those plastic chairs hurt my back . you know Barney hates noisy places and that place is noisy . Burger Barn would like me to say that this is an isolated incident . and that the rest of the barns are not selling green hamburgers . Hey it 's about time you guys got here . we had a little trouble at the lab . someone want to show us where the Kryptonite is ? it 's right this way . What ? I mean what is - what is the thing - Woah ! This is serious green . Absolute Zero This is not your normal radiation . B-Man you picking up anything ? Not from the burgers but I 'm definately getting something from this stuff . Billy : Let me give it a shot . No . Woah ! What can you tell me ? You got a box of some really wierd burgers here . El : Uh-Uh . Not quite a box . There are three of those patties missing . Billy : You mean somebody actually served this stuff ? Uh oh . They 'll be here soon . We haven 't got it . There 's no point in worrying . Did you call social security ? Sixteen times in the past four weeks . Lost in the mail . Barney 's cheques aren 't coming . It says the Governors going to be here over the weekend . Maybe we can complain to him about it . First the electricity Then the heat . Now ... They 're opening a new nuclear power plant in Santa Clarita . Cheaper power . Well it 's not gonna help us you know if we get thrown out in the streets . I 'm scared Bessie . I 'm scared for Barney . I 'll get it . Is there a problem Mr. Tanrich ? Come on . Today 's the day . I- - I know that you think we have asked a lot of you .. I didn 't come here for a sob story . I came here for this month 's rent and thirty bucks for the furniture rental . Furniture rental ? What ? Didn 't you get your notice in the mailbox ? New charges . Barney : We won 't pay it . B - Barney isn 't feeling well . I 'm feeling fine . Barney ? For the last three months we 've gone without heat and electricity to make your rent . Sometimes we 've gone without food . And now you expect us to pay for this junk ? Barney doesn 't mean- - I mean exactly what I mean . or I 'll put you on the street pops . those are the rules . And where in the rules does it say that you can bully and cheat people three times your age ? Barney - no no no no . You 've got a lot of lip old man . Take your hands off me . Now ! ' El : So what do you think its gonna do to ' em ? i don 't know . Massive indigestion 's not A bad bet but at their age I tell ya it 's anyone 's guess . Hey Glo do you know where they live ? Glo ? Hey ! Hey we 're sorry Glo come on . we didn 't know they were tainted ok ? huh ? Come on Glo we 're your friends . They were my friends Glo don 't you think you 're carrying this hot seat thing a little too far ? I think they live in a tenement on 23rd st . grab some electric burgers for the lab test and let 's roll . please Glo. show a little " magnamimity " okay ? Please ! come on Glo What 's friendship mean to ya ? huh ? Can 't you take a joke chica ? ( painful scream ) Ahhh. burger barn 's famous toasted buns . Mr. Tanrich : Hey Barney come on ... Oh no don 't ! Please don 't ! The window ! look what you did to the window ! Hey look at me ! No Bessie ! Such a sweet little guy . the way he 'd flirt with me ... Would you stop blaming yourself Gloria ? Les and Freto were ... cooked the hamburgers . I served them . what if I killed them Johnny B ? what if I find them and there dead ? please ! I 'd say their still alive and kicking . Hey I can do it too ! Mrs. Salad don 't ! Glenda ? Gloria ! Well after those burgers anyone feel like cruising for dairy Queen ? please I don 't think you understand how important this is to me . Billy : Have you considered how unimportant this is to all of us ? Huh Richard ? Have you ? i already told the governors people you 're considering ... Considering ? I 'm not even listening Richard All right this is a little silly . Okay I told you guys this . No Hat . Got the work from the FDA and ? and it came from outer space What ? The meteor . The meteor fell to the grass and the grass was eaten by the steer and the steer was eaten by ... . us . I know it wasn 't this morning 's bran . oh my ... . where 's the pizza ? incubator . alright . pepperoni ? is that what you got for me ? I love this Hayes ! who ordered the anchovies ? Beat you by how much ? uh ... 200 pounds . Way to be Bessy . Thinks she 's Arnold Schwarzenegger . She 's better . As near as I can figure it the radiation made your adrenal gland kick in and vroom Is that like the car accident where the mother picks up the station wagon to save her kid . Yo Arnold . Hey ! Glo : I was just worried what it would do to you . Worried ? I feel like I 'm fresh off the show room floor . You like to fish ? why ? just asking . what 's the word ? Great you 're kinda cute doc . Can I buy you a drink ? You know you sorta remind me of my sweet old ex . Thank you . I ran down all my contacts at Social security and city hall . no luck . You ordered the anchovies . maybe . I 'm sorry but you 're out of an apartment . Barney 's social security checks are going to take a while to sort out . They understand the problem but there 's nothing else that I can do . Look Jane ... you should - shouldn 't you watch this eating thing ? that 's starting to look like John Candy here. you know . I mean the kid 's gonna come out pickled . You better watch it or I 'm gonna name him after you . what are we gonna do ? ok ? About Barney and the girls . Look we have to have some place to observe them while we 're testing . and it 's not an old folks home either . Well maybe I 've got a place that is . Billy : how ' bout this ? huh ? Is this what I 'm talking about ? Alright ! Hey Billy Hayes ' summer camp for really strange seniors is now open . we 've got your uhm .. We 've got um ... your kinky nighttime activities . It 's limited of course to consenting adults here Barney . How 's the fishing ? the ocean is this way . you 're a nutty guy . use the house but the only thing is you 've got to keep an eye on them . I mean we don 't know what else this radiation can do to them . It can turn them into zombies or ... so watch them . You two gonna looking for something to cure them . Well we 're gonna give a small sample to a lab mouse and then we 're just gonna see what we can find . ya know ? I mean what am I supposed to do with an 80 year old woman that power lifts ? Rock and roll . head on the highway ! Looking for adventure . In whatever comes our way gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space I like smoke and lightnin Heavy metal thunder Racin ' with the wind And the feelin ' that I 'm under gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space Like a true Nature 's child born to be wild We have climbed so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild wild born to be wild born to be wild born to be wild Get your motor runnin Head out on the highway Lookin ' for adventure In whatever comes our way gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once and I 've forgotten everything was so beautiful . Born to be wild El he 's over here by the table . This is your last chance Hayes . Today 's the day . Richard I 'm a little busy right now . I don 't think you realize how valuable a relationship with the govener can be . he 's in the corner . Over here in the corner . so am I wait wait wait . Don 't hurt him . ( growls ) Don 't hurt him ? What about me ? Now we can run around this lab and trash it and break everything in sight all day long . Do you think that 's gonna get you to switzerland ? I don 't think so . Not a prayer pal . You 're dreaming . Not even Wisconsin . Just - ' scuse me . You got a minute ? Boy Charles ! why don 't we just sit . We 'll smooz . We 'll talk . you 're a nutty guy . I mean we love you . Why don 't you just ... . Look . Alright pal What if I promised you like ya know with the sports section at the bottom and all the swiss cheese you can eat . and i promise no more psychadleic burgers Now is that a deal or what ? He knows who the boss is here . Why don 't you open the freezer door . The freezer ? ! Oh Billy . That 's a little mouse . It 's just the freezer . El ! why don 't you go ahead and open the freezer door ! Open the door El ! El : You still got him ? What do you think ? Yeah I got him ! It 's ok . Wait A minute . oh boy ! oh no ! Open the door El ! open the door . it 's open ? Ok . don 't hurt him " ? Okay . It takes a shameless person to lie to a mouse . Well off hand I 'd say that was a litle excessive . Wouldn 't you El ? But a deranged Hulk Hogan ? Well what do you think it is ? It could be a migrane or a hormone imbalance or ... maybe a really bad reaction to the Burger Barn MSG . Well whatever it is it 's a walking time bomb ok ? and we better get them back here pronto . - Right . - What a day . It 's not fair . One last walk and then what ? The Back to a cage in the lab ? look at it this way . Had a pretty good time while it lasted . Jane ? Do you really think it 's bad ? Billy wouldn 't say . look . maybe it wouldn 't be a bad idea if someone kep an eye on them . maybe it is just for some more testing . Bessy . they could have found something wrong with her I suppose . I feel fine . me too . Or maybe they found the cure for it . - Oh ! - Hi . Time to go back ? Do you want to ? No . I 'd rather spend two days like this then ... . twenty years like this . what can we do ? Tell the governor what you think about Nuclear power . Stop Santa Clarita before it happens . Four o clock today ! be there . What can we do ? We can tell someone what it 's like to be old . to be forgotten . We 've got time and energy for that . Be a damn shame to waste it . Where are we going ? Santa Clarita Guess you 're gonna go see the Governor . Uh huh . Yeah. yeah . No . Come on ! Oh come on Stetmeyer . The Governor and I were counting on ya . Now you said you had the Misfits locked . I didn 't say locked Cusack . I said as good as locked . There 's a difference . So you gotta let us know . You gotta tell us Glo ! What ? I can 't hear over all this yelling . Will you have a little consideration ? ! I 'm on the phone with the Governor . Sort of . Look Glo ! We got three senior citizens out there that could go ballistic at any second and level Venice and probably my house . So can you tell us where they are please ? ! I don 't know ! Will you stop yelling at her Hayes ! I 'm not yelling ! Okay I 'm yelling ! look .. Jane .. If she waited this long to tell us that she saw them go Don 't you think there 's a pretty fair shot that she knows where they 're going . Right Glo ? Right Glo ? ! talk to her . Forget it Hayes . I would 've done the same thing . B-man . if you could have seen their faces ... . Will you stop thinking about their faces and think about this mouse ? Look at this ! Aaahhhh ! huh ? okay ? See these dents ? he 's not slam dancing in here . they don 't slam dance in dog cages . Well don 't you think they deserve a chance to help themselves ? she knows ! Glo : Well don 't you ? After seeing the way they lived and knowing it 's only going to get worse ? Of course they do . look we all feel the same way . But Billy 's right . We have got to get them before they start having a reaction like Boy charles . Oh excuse my young man . we 'd like to see the Governor . Well I 'm sure if you stood down by the platform you 'll get a pretty good view . He doesn 't understand . What Bessie means is that we would like to speak to the governor . We 've got some problems that need handling . sir . It 's just that his time is rather limited today . I 'm afraid he 'll only be able to give his speech and then talk to the press . What area is he talking to the press in ? inside . inside ? when he officially starts the reactor . N - n - now if you folks please would excuse me ... excuse me ... oh - oh . I 'm sure the Governor would appreciate your vote in uh November . We didn 't come here to listen to a speech . that 's where we 've got to be . But how do we get in ? Maybe there 's a back door . come on . just tell us where you think they are . You know Billy there 's still time . okay ? There is a problem here . They went to see the Governor . what was that ? He 's opening up this nuclear thing in Santa Clarea today . and they went to go talk to him . uh- - Grab Boy charles . We better keep an eye on him . do me a favor and call ahead . Thanks . You 're going ? ! Have them hold them till we get there . Will you be wearing your uniforms ? please ! does Dick Stetmeyer come through or what ? how 's he doing ? you really think Bessie could react this way ? I mean she was fine at the beach . the beach . put her in a steel box . Claustrophobia ? Seems pretty well gaurded Barney . Three old people ? get serious . I 'm busy . yeah . the Misfits . I owe you . All right . I 'll do my best . Thanks . looks like the misfits are gonna show .. make sure they get a photo opportunity with the boss . really ? you think they might have their picture taken with me ? Need anything else ? That 's it . I don 't see any gaurds . Why don 't we go in here ? how do we get through the fence ? ( Grunts ) Arnold Schwarzenegger ! Get the press down here . Here comes the Governor . can we get a statement from you ? can there really be a safe nuclear plant ? the Misfits of Science ! Glo : Barney ! You see him ? Glo : No ! Reporter : Are the misfits here to support the new plant ? They only answer questions with the Governor . for coming . My Neice would die if she knew I met you . Now the Governor is planning ... look . Has anyone seen three old people ? Alright it 's two women and an old man with a funny looking hat . okay ? These people could be very ill . I think I have . where 'd they go ? That means it 's atomic Those signs are all over the place . It 's just a warning . it 's a pretty big door . huh ? girls . OK ? here they come now . - Misfits . I 'd like you to meet the Governor - Gov : Hi ! How are you doing ? Gov : Hey big fella ! What do ya say ? It 's ok . We 'll work on the springsteen concert . why don 't you guys check out the ocean side and we 'll head up the road . could they be inside ? Security 's pretty tight . They 're starting up the reactor now . What do you have in there ? A baby . I mean the cage . a mouse . give me the control rod reading for reactor one . Tech : Control rods are out 40 % and stable . Reactor Chief : Go to 50 but we 're getting an open spillway door . Barney : Long tunnel Irma : It 's a very long tunnel . Bessie : Feels a little stuffy to me . It 's kinda hard to breathe . Barney : But if this is the only way we can get to the Governor ... Spillway door open and confirmed . Takes a power torque to open that up . I need video confirmation Hold the rods at 50 . holding at 50 % Barney : The Governor would be at the control center . Irma : Is the reactor working ? Bessie : Not yet . The Governor is gonna turn it on when the press comes . the Fence It 's gotta be Bessie . Tech : Video 's up . Reactor Chief : My god there 's people in there ! - tech : They 're opening the vent corridor . Shut down the reactor . Shut down . Barney ! let 's move ! Barney ! Radiation leak confirmed . Seal off the corridor . Seal it off ! Reporter : We 're here at the controversial Santa Clarita Nuclear power plant whose opening by the governor today has been marred by an extraordinary event . Security officers and plant officials are still at a loss to explain the security breach by three people believed to be in their eighties who are apparently attempting to speak with the governor . The word that we 're getting out here right now is that the seniors are trapped in a radioactive steam vent corridor and are apparently suffering from some sort of claustrophobia . ( screaming ) Can 't we help them ? we gotta do something . we can 't just watch them . pal . Okay ? This is not a regular case of claustrophobia . We 're talking masters of the universe with a secure case of cabin fever ! The corridor remains sealed until the NRC inspects the sight and gives me the green light . Tell me it wasn 't you hayes . Tell me you had nothing to do with this at all . the Governor was right ! huh ? control wiring . But it 's 40 gauge steel. she can 't break out . Yeah ? Billy ! This is 20 gauge steel . What the hell 's inside ? a claustrophobic mouse . Boy Charles ! grab that mouse . Mouse . Open the door . - But I can 't - Open the Damn Door ! There 's a short in the door control . she broke the pipe . Oh dear god they got to the water coolant too . Hit the cut off . The whole corridor is down . It won 't respond . That 's our cue . Wait ! Wait ! Dick : We 're not insured for this . you gotta do something . Uh does this mean I won 't be giving my speech on Nuclear Safety ? It 's a lock . I absolutely forbid you to go into that room . Reactor Chief : If we go by the book I think we have a good shot of containing this thing with you . Billy : You think ? Alright well what if we stop the leak ? Can you be sure ? You stop that leak you 're as good as gone . The radiation in the reactor room ... you think I 'm just an administer well I know about radiation . hold it . Look . what ? Pittsburgh Cinder . Is it really worth it ? to save three old people ? that 's the kind of attitude that got us into all this . for your own safety please clear the area . Reporter : Evacuation the area would seem to indicate a serious problem Governor . but but I - I frankly really feel there 's no cause for alarm . Then you 'll be staying to monitor the situation ? no . I have an important dinner engagement in Beverly Hils . you won 't have much time to weld that pipe shut . Before the reactor hits super critical Otherwise the whole thing goes Boom . ok ? Wait a second . that doesn 't sound so bad to me . I mean it 's a hell of a lot better than I use to get on my biology exam . If we keep losing water at this rate We 'll be super critical in five minutes . You guys grade alot harder here . Let 's bolt . let 's cook . look it 's um ... a lot more fun than doing my laundrey . Hey Take care of the football . Ok ? I feel my temperature rising . Reactor Chief : They 're in the Hot Corridor . They 're picking up the worst radiation now . Jane : Billy are you ok ? Billy : A little fried but we 're still moving . Oh help ! Down here El : This is it . Billy : Is this the conduit ? El : Yeah . can you find a way in here ? I think I can slip in through there . Barney : Sounds like somebody 's out there . How can they get into us ? hit it ! come on . It 's too heavy . Reporter : We are now two miles from the Santa Clarita Reactor which according to our sources .. has only the Misfits of Science between it and disaster . A ruptured water conduit pipe has driven the reactor to near super critical temperatures . increasing the turbine steam pressure to unmanageable heights . Now apparently the Misfits are going to attempt to quell this thing before the excess steam has to be vented . Vented into the same corridor where these senior citizens are trapped . Glo : It 's still going up . Billy : How long before you have to vent the steam ? Two minutes . El ? do you see anything ? El : It looks like the power line 's pulled loose from the junction box . It shouldn 't take more than a minute . Sure . come on . woah . Boy Charles take it easy . Bessie : Help ! Try to do something ! give it another shot ! El will help you with the motor . El ! El : Boy Charles . take it easy . It was Billy who threw you in the freezer . the short mean guy . I 'm the tall nice guy . I 'm not so tall ... Now . But I 'm still nice . you only have a minute and a half . Billy : Jane we can 't do anything untio El turns on the juice . Yes we can . Don 't you have to save your stuff for the well ? I 'm more concerned about getting Bessie . go ahead . I don 't believe it . Is that you ? One minute . And you 're name ? Boy Charles " was Billy 's idea . I told him you were a girl But he 's into this gender bender phase . My choice was Vanity . 45 seconds . ok ? have I ever told you you have beautiful eyes ? no ? beautiful . and pink is my favorite color . Thirty seconds . we 've got power in the corridor the water cutoff is responding . We 've still gotta vent that steam . can you handle it ? I 'll have to . Barney ! get them outta here . Come on ! take cover in there . just forget about fixing the cooling pipe and just get out of there . get the hell out of there . I 'll catch up . Hold them off . that 's all I can give you . you got ten seconds before they vent the steam . get out of here . I 'll catch up . Johnny : Go ! Go on . Five .. four .. Three .. Two .. One . Billy : B-Man Is that you ? It 's amazing what a little motivation will do to you . Billy : Heyhey B-man ! You 're a nutty guy ! Billy ? Billy ! Answer me ! Jane : Are you there ? huh ? it would 've been more fun watching you do your laundry . killer . talk to me . I don 't like the way I feel . Irma : My eyes . I can 't see . Guess Arnold feels like a ninety eight pound weakling again too . You 'll always be Arnold to me . It seems the radiation from the reactor neutralized the radiation from the space burgers . but it just might save our lives . You wanna tell us how ? Billy : You had to neutralize the conventional radiation it 's a major breakthrough . You knew ? You didn 't . ok . that 's the way it goes . bye . El : Well ? Billy : They already knew . They already knew ? they gathered up all the hamburger and the meteorite and the grass and they threw it in a radioactive storage bank . So what ? so the bank already had some other radioactive stuff in it and when they put it in ... It neutralized everything . Billy : And they ended up with about ten tons of worthless rock . Here . Tell me I don 't have to eat another one of these things . you 're clean . Billy . Starting to think about calling the band Johnny-B and the Heartburns . ok . Can you please be quiet ? Some of us are trying to watch our Governor . And so this near tragedy brings to light two problems that I intend to address in my next campaign . proper care for our older generation and nuclear safety for the generations to come . Does he have a way with words ? God . What a statesman . Means anything ? Maybe a windbag but there 's been talk of reform . Looks like Barney and the girls are heroes . the Grey Crusaders . Hey did Glo split ? Had a date to go fishing . What is she serious ? Wouldn 't it be nice if we were older Then we wouldn 't have to wait so long Irma : I wouldn 't trust him alone with her . Would you ? Bessie : Heavens no . The man is such a flirt . You know it 's gonna make it that much better When we can say goodnight and stay together Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Misfits Zap me with your misfit science Shoot me full of ecstasy Electric and alive Love you for your mind I can feel it ! straight from my heart oh-no-ohohohoh Science is over Class dismissed ! Class dismissed ! Goodnight Bunnies

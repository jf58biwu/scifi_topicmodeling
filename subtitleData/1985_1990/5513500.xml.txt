 MALE ANNOUNCER : This is Media Break . You give us three minutes and we 'll give you the world . Good morning . I 'm Casey Wong with Jesse Perkins . Top story , Pretoria . The threat of nuclear confrontation in South Africa escalated today when the ruling white military government of that besieged city-state unveiled a French-made neutron bomb and affirmed its willingness to use the three megaton device as the city 's last line of defense . And the President 's first press conference from the Star Wars orbiting peace platform got off to a shaky start , when power failed causing a brief , but harmless , period of weightlessness for the visiting President and his staff . We 'll be back in a moment . Is it time for that big operation ? This may be the most important decision of your life . So come down and talk to one of our qualified surgeons here at the Family Heart Center . We feature the complete Jarvik line , series 7 Sports Heart by Jensen , Yamaha . You pick the heart . Extended warranties , financing . Qualifies for health tax credit . And remember , we care . Three dead police officers , one critically injured . Police union leaders blame Omni Consumer Products , OCP , the firm which recently entered into a contract with the city to fund and run the Detroit Metropolitan Police Department . Dick Jones , Division President , OCP . Every policeman knows when he joins the force that there are certain inherent risks that come with the territory . Ask any cop , he 'll tell you , " If you can 't stand the heat , you better stay out of the kitchen . " Although seriously wounded , Officer Frank Frederickson escaped and identified this man . Clarence Boddicker , unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit . Now sought in connection with the deaths of 31 police officers . Today , he 's at large , while doctors at Henry Ford Memorial Hospital fight to save the life of Officer Frank Frederickson . Good luck , Frank . ( ELECTRONIC BUZZING ) Attempted murder ? It 's not like he killed someone . This is a clear violation of my client 's civil rights . Make it aggravated assault , and I can make bail , in cash , now . Listen , pal , your client 's a scumbag , you 're a scumbag , and scumbags see the judge on Monday morning ! Now get out of my police station , and take laughing boy with you ! MAN 1 : Get over there ! ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) COP 1 : You have the right to remain silent . Do you understand me ? MAN 2 : Sure , sure . - COP 2 : Priors ? - No . Hi . Uh , Murphy . Transferring in from Metro South . REED : Nice precinct . Yeah , pretty good . We work for a living down here , Murphy . Get your armor and suit up . WOMAN : Please take me home ! Not now , E.J. Get a cup of coffee . Oh , Sarge . Stark , is there any word on Frederickson ? They 're still listing him as critical . His wife must be going out of her mind . - Murphy , huh ? - Yeah , that 's me . - Manson . - Hi . What brings you to this little paradise ? Beats me , man . I think OCP 's moving a lot of new guys up here . Omni Consumer Products . What a bunch of morons . They 're gonna manage this department right into the ground ! - Where are you from ? - Metro South . Welcome to hell . - Murphy . - Yo . OFFICER : You cut 10 guys loose over on the east side . You try to get backup when you 're in a jam . Yeah , try to get a medevac after you 've been jammed . I 'll tell you what we should do . We should strike . Fuck ' em ! ( SHUSHING ) Oh , boy . The funeral 's tomorrow . The department requests all officers not on duty to attend . Any donations for the family may be given to Cecil as usual . And I don 't want to hear any more talk about strike ! We 're not plumbers . We 're police officers . And police officers don 't strike . Murphy , front and center . ( OFFICERS MUTTERING ) ( MAN YELLING ) Hello , tiger . ( YELLING ) WOMAN : Hey , hey , hey ! ( OFFICERS CHATTERING ) MAN : Oh , yes !

Glad to know you , Murphy . Pretty neat . I better drive until you know your way around . I usually drive when I 'm breaking in a new partner . ( GUM BUBBLE POPPING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) You really think the old man is gonna be there ? Why would they invite us ? All division heads are bringing their support teams . It 's big . I figure they 're green-lighting Delta City . What , are you kidding ? They never do anything ahead of schedule . It 's Jones . He 's got the 209 series online and now he wants to show off . JOHNSON : That 's a tough break , Bob . KINNEY : What ? What ? Well , ED 209 ran into serious delays and cost overruns . The old man ordered a backup plan . FEMALE VOICE : 95th floor . Have a nice day . Probably just to light a fire under Jones ' ass . - Yeah ? - Old Bob here gets the assignment . Yeah . Nobody in Security Concepts takes it seriously . It 's a better plan . Fucking Jones ! I 'd go straight to the Old Man if I could . Don 't mess with Jones , man . He 'll make sushi out of you . Yeah , you better be careful , man . I heard Jones is a real shark . - Who asked you , twerp ? - Bob . What about this police thing , what 's the problem ? Their union 's been bitching ever since we took over . You know , the usual nonsense . We 'll turn things around . Mmm-hmm . Good , very good . Let 's get started . Now , friends , I 've had this dream for more than a decade now . A dream which I 've invited you all to share with me . In six months , we begin construction of Delta City . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Where Old Detroit now stands . Old Detroit has a cancer . The cancer is crime . And it must be cut out before we employ the 2 million workers that will breathe life into this city again . Yes . Although shifts in the tax structure have created an economy ideal for corporate growth , community services , in this case law enforcement , have suffered . I think it 's time we gave something back . Dick . Take a close look at the track record of this company . ( SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ON T.V. ) And you 'll see that we have gambled in markets traditionally regarded as nonprofit . Hospitals , prisons , space exploration . I say good business is where you find it . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) As you know , we 've entered into a contract with the city to run local law enforcement . But at Security Concepts , we believe an efficient police force is only part of the solution . No . We need something more . We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer . A cop that doesn 't need to eat or sleep . A cop with superior firepower and the reflexes to use it . Fellow executives , it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement . Ed 209 .

MCNAMARA : He didn 't hear the gun drop . He didn 't hear it ? WOMAN 2 : Oh , God . Dick , I 'm very disappointed . I 'm sure it 's only a glitch , a temporary setback . You call this a glitch ? We 're scheduled to begin construction in six months . Your temporary setback could cost us $ 50 million in interest payments alone . Not necessarily , sir . Perhaps you 're aware of the Robocop program developed by myself at Security Concepts as a contingency against just this sort of thing . Thank you for your concern , Mr. Morton . I 'm sure this is something we can take up in my office ... Now , wait a minute . Dick ! WOMAN 3 : Get me out of here ! Maybe what we need here is a fresh perspective . Tell me about your plan , Mr. Morton . How long will it take ? We 're ready to go , sir . We 've restructured the police department and placed prime candidates according to risk factor . I 'm confident that we can go to prototype within 90 days . Good , very good . Get your staff together , Mr. Morton . I 'll expect a full presentation in 20 minutes . Thank you , sir . ( ALARM RINGING ) Yes ! Now , that 's how it 's done in the big leagues , Johnson . You see an opening , you go for it . You better watch your back , Bob . Jones is going to come looking for you .

It just turns me on . God , you girls are so great . I mean I just ... I love to be with intelligent women . Smart is so sexy . I know . Sometimes I could just think of something , and it could just get me so horny . Yeah , well , a mind is a terrible thing to waste . WOMAN : Yeah . BOB : I get bored so easily . Yep . And you need lots of stimulation , Bobby . - Yes , I do . Don 't move . - I won 't . Bob ? What ? - Bob , save some for me . - Don 't worry . I 'll ... ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Must be the champagne .

Hello , buddy boy . Dick Jones here . I guess you 're on your knees about now , begging for your life . Pathetic . You don 't feel so cocky now , do you , Bob ? Whatever he 's paying you , I 'll double it right now . You know what the tragedy is here , Bob ? We could have been friends . But you wouldn 't go through proper channels . You went over my head . That hurt . But life goes on . It 's an old story , the fight for love and glory , huh , Bob ? It helps if you think of it as a game , Bob . Every game has a winner and a loser . I 'm cashing you out , Bob . ( BEEPING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( MEN CHATTERING ) MAN : We need more tubing . CLARENCE : I don 't think I want to pay you that , Sal . SAL : I don 't give a shit what you want to pay . I set the prices here . Listen , pal , maybe you haven 't heard . I 'm the guy in Old Detroit . You want space in my marketplace , you 're gonna have to give me a volume discount . I 'm not into discounts . Joe , show the man what we brought him for Christmas . Think about it , chum . Good business is where you find it . Okay , let me try to put this in perspective . You killed a bunch of cops . The word around is that you 've got a lot of heavy connections downtown . You make a lot of my friends nervous . A lot of people would love to see a guy like me put a guy like you out of business . I don 't know . I don 't know . Maybe I 'm just not making myself clear . I don 't want to fuck with you , Sal . But I got the connections . I got the sales organization . I got the muscle to shove enough of this factory so far up your stupid wop ass that you 'll shit snow for a year . Frankie , blow this cocksucker 's head off . Guns , guns , guns ! Come on , Sal ! The Tigers are playing tonight . I never miss a game . ( CHUCKLING ) Just kidding . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) ( BANGING ) Go ! Go . ( BEEPING ) Come quietly or there will be trouble . Fuck you !

I 've got protection ! You have the right to an attorney . What is this shit ? Goddamn it . Goddamn it ! Listen to me ! Listen to me , you fuck ! There 's another guy . He 's OCP . He 's a senior president . Anything you say may be used against you . It 's Dick Jones ! Don 't you get it ? You cocksucker ! I work for Dick Jones . Dick Jones ! He 's the number two guy at OCP . OCP runs the cops ! You 're a cop . ( BONES CRUNCHING ) Cop . Yes . I am a cop . I don 't like it any more than you do , Reed , but listen ! You listen to me , you asshole ! You 're talking about shutting down a major metropolitan police force . Without cops , this city would tear itself apart . The Union thinks you should know there was a strike vote last night . We lost five guys last week . We 're getting creamed out there , Reed . Book him . What 's the charge ? He 's a cop killer . Shit ! Just give me my fucking phone call . I understand . Look , the lawyers will have you out in 24 hours . Just don 't say anything else . Jesus , you really screwed up . ( BEEPING ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) CLARENCE : Don 't you get it ? I work for Dick Jones ! Dick Jones ! I work for Dick Jones ! He runs OCP . OCP runs the cops . Come in , Officer . You know , I don 't usually see anyone without an appointment , but in your case , I 'll make an exception . You are under arrest . On what charge ? Aiding and abetting a known felon . Sounds like I 'm in a lot of trouble . You better take me in . I Will . ( ROBOCOP GRUNTING ) What 's the matter , Officer ? ( GROANING ) I 'll tell you what 's the matter . It 's a little insurance policy called Directive 4 . My little contribution to your psychological profile . Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown . What did you think ? That you were an ordinary police officer ? You 're our product . And we can 't very well have our products turning against us , can we ? ( GROANING ) Still a little fight left in you . Maybe you 'd like to meet a friend of mine . I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake . Now it 's time to erase that mistake .

I 'm Jesse Perkins with Casey Wong . Top story , Santa Barbara . 10,000 acres of wooded residential land were scorched in an instant when a laser cannon aboard the strategic defense peace platform misfired today during routine start-up tests . Casey . Yes , it was a day of mourning for the families of 113 people known dead at this hour , among them , two former United States Presidents who had retired in the Santa Barbara area . A day of mourning for a country . Police union representatives and OCP continue negotiations today in hopes of averting a citywide strike by police , scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight . Justin Ballard-Watkins has more . They 're still on duty , but what about tomorrow ? That 's the question we put to people in the crime-plagued Lexington area . They 're public servants . They got job security . They 're not supposed to strike . It 's a free society , except there ain 't nothin ' free 'cause there 's no guarantees , you know ? You 're on your own . It 's the law of the jungle . ( CHUCKLING ) MAN : Be very careful . WOMAN : Excuse me , please . MAN : They must be remodeling . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Hiya , Barbara . Listen , I 'm here to see Dick Jones . But when I 'm done , I 've got some free time . Maybe you could fit me in . He 's expecting you , Mr. Boddicker . You can keep the gum . WOMAN : This looks good . MAN : Get a measurement on that . Bring a hammer , too . Hey , Dickie boy . How 's tricks ? That thing is still alive . I don 't know what you 're talking about . The police officer who arrested you , the one you spilled your guts to . Hey . Take a look at my face , Dick . He was trying to kill me . He 's a cyborg , you idiot . He recorded every word you said . His memory 's admissible as evidence . You involved me . You 're gonna have to kill it . Listen , chief . Your company built the fucking thing . Now I got to deal with it ? I don 't have time for this bullshit . Suit yourself , Clarence . But Delta City begins construction in two months . That 's 2 million workers living in trailers . That means drugs , gambling , prostitution . Virgin territory for the man who knows how to open up new markets . One man could control it all , Clarence . I guess we 're gonna be friends after all , Richard . ( CHUCKLING ) Destroy it . Gonna need some major firepower . ( BEEPING ) You got access to military weaponry ? We practically are the military . Did you bring the gun ? The precinct was deserted . Half the force didn 't show up for work today . Everyone else walks out at midnight . I guess we 're on strike . I wasn 't sure what you needed . I sort of grabbed things . Your gun . You asked for this ? ( WHIRRING ) I brought you some food . No , thank you . I 'm not hungry . ( WHIRRING ) You may not like what you 're going to see . It 's really good to see you again , Murphy . Murphy had a wife and son . What happened to them ? After the funeral , she moved away . Where did they go ? She thought you were dead . She started over again . I can feel them . But I can 't remember them . Leave me alone . ( GLASS BREAKING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( PEOPLE WHOOPING ) ( ALARM RINGING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) WOMAN ON T.V. : Happy birthday , Dave . She 's from me . Well , can I have you both ? - Sure .

Joey 's got a car just like yours , man . Yo , Clarence , what do you think , buddy ? What do you got there , Clarence ? MAN : Wait up for me ! Whoa ! A new toy ! Can I play ? Watch this . Wait ... Wait a minute , Clarence , Clarence ! Shit ! What the fuck ? - Nice car , Joe . - Fuck you , Clarence . Let me try that . Cobra Assault Cannon . State of the art . Bang ! Bang ! ( ALARM RINGING ) I like it ! Give it up , faggot . Let a man ... No , butthole ! Get your own ! Come on ! ( WHOOPING ) ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) CLARENCE : Get the other gun , Emil ! JOE : No car is safe ! Do it , Emil ! Heads up , you guys . ( BEEPING ) He 's in the steel mill . Let 's go . All right , cut the horseshit ! We 're moving out . CLARENCE : Come on , Emil ! Get your ass in the van ! Come on , lard ass , let 's move it ! I 'll get you , faggot ! ( COCKING ) ( GUN FIRING ) What are you doing ? My targeting system is a little messed up . Can I help you ? Aim for me .

ROBOCOP : Clarence ! ( SPITTING ) Okay . I give up . I 'm not arresting you anymore . Now , wait a second . Wait a minute . You 're taking this kind of personal , aren 't you ? Come on , man . Come on , now . You 're making me nervous . Come on , you can 't do this . Come on now ! Don 't mess around ! Hey ! Hey ! Come on , man , now , don 't get cute ! Die , you bastard ! Yeah ! Yeah ! All right ! All right ! I got him , Clarence ! I got him ! ( EXCLAIMS ) ( ROBOCOP GROANING ) ( SCREAMING ) Sayonara , Robocop ! Lewis ! Lewis ! Murphy , I 'm a mess ! They 'll fix you . They fix everything . ( GRUNTING ) The police strike could really work for us . By the end of the week , we can have Ed 209s in place all over the city and expect immediate public support . I 've got one downstairs guarding the building now . You are illegally parked on private property . You have 20 seconds to move your vehicle . because whatever happens , this corporation will live up to the guiding principles of its founder . Courage , strength , conviction . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) We will meet each new challenge with the same aggressive attitude . MAN : What is it ? ( ALL CHATTERING ) WOMAN : I don 't know . How can we help you , Officer ? Dick Jones is wanted for murder . This is absurd ! That thing is a violent mechanical psychopath . My program will not allow me to act against an officer of this company . These are serious charges . What is your evidence ? I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake . Now it 's time to erase that mistake . ( ALL CHATTERING ) I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake . Now it 's time to erase that mistake . MAN : He 's got a gun ! Get up ! I want a chopper . Now ! We will walk to the roof very calmly . I will board the chopper with my hostage .

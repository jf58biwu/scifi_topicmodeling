 Run , run ! What are you hiding ? Let us see ! Help ! Momo ! Peace ! - Let 's go . - Yes . I 'll get even for this . Did he hurt you ? Thank you . What for ? Don 't worry . Nothing frightens me . As a sign of thanks I 'll give you this . - What is it ? - It 's a time machine . - Thank you . - Don 't you want to try it ? - It must be fast , right ? - It goes " beep , boop beep " . Nothing frightens me . There it is ! Where are you ? Momo ! THE STORY OF THE ELECTRICITY POLE BOY I can smell her here . Who is it ? She 's alive , Professor Sariba . Get her ! I don 't know why , but first I 'll say I 'm sorry . - There they are ! - What is that on your back ? Where are we ? Ochida ! Hikari , destroy them ! I don 't know how . I 'm sorry ! It 's too stinky ! I 've decided ! Let 's get Adam Special working here , okay ? This is interesting . I was waiting for you . I knew you 'd arrive ... with your electricity pole . Excuse me , but where are we ? Where have I ended up ? 25 years have gone by since your times . 25 years ? 10 years ago , the Shinsegumi vampire gang rose from the earth , and their Adam Junior Bomb covered the sky with black clouds . The school where I taught was destroyed . The reign of darkness began . Humans have been reduced to animals , that run in the streets by night . But the Adam Junior Bomb has space-time limits . So they are rushing to develop another weapon . It seems it 's a maxi-attack space rocket , more powerful than the Adam Junior . Do you understand , Hikari ? You have to fight . - What ? - Only you can do it . You have to stop the production of the secret weapon . - Goodbye ! - I know . You need me . I also know that if you fight with all your might , you will have help from the pole you carry on your back . Yes , your electricity pole . You actually saved my life earlier . You can 't say it was me that saved your life . Thank you so much . I 'll repay you . There you go . Hikari , it looks wonderful on you . - Not yet ! - Will it really work ? Naturally . The machine needs the energy ... emitted by human bodies ... during their growth . The machine is growing . When this woman is mature , the machine will be mature too . But when will she be mature ? Woman mature at age 14 or 15 ! She could be a waste of time ! Do you have time to wait for another child to grow ? No ! We don 't have time ! I know ! I know we 're late with the project , and there aren 't many Adam Juniors left . The important thing is to wait and have faith . You just have to wait for completion of the Adam Special , the super-secret weapon ! An enormous black cloud will cover the sky . This time it will be an indestructible black cloud . No more sun ! A world of darkness will come and we will be immortal ! Soon our dream of eternal life will come true . At the right moment I 'll suck your blood . At that point , my eternal beauty , you will create eternal darkness . You will be named Eva ! Hurry up and become a woman ! We must destroy the Shinsengumi 's new secret weapon ! Hikari ! You 're our only hope . Come on ! You 're the only one that can destroy the Shinsengumi ! You 're the only one . My love . Is it true that this boy 's electricity pole ... can save us from darkness ? Is it true , my dear ? It feels like we 're going to see a ghost . What is it ? It looks like a sacrificial victim . We have to save her . Stop ! Come out ! Come out and fight ! It 's useless to fight me . Hello . You deserve this ! Eva will die , if you break her connection with Adam bomb . Go ahead , if you dare . What are you waiting for ? Come on ! - Professor ! - Is this something important to you ? Kyabian ... Do you want some ? Good hit ! Come on ! Hikari , your shining light ! Show me the power of your electric light pole . Hikari , you have to use your power ! Sorr ... Sorry ... I 'm sorry ! What is it ? Why ? You can 't win , fool ! Blood from an old woman and a handicapped person is no good . Let 's get out of here ! - Eva ? - I sucked her blood . Now she 'll live for ever . She 'll be eternally beautiful . It 's the Professor 's photo album . The Professor was quite beautiful . Very pretty . She was attractive . " Me at age 25 . " " Me at age 22 . " " At age 20 . " " At age 18 . " I 'm old now , right ? When I was young my husband always said , that the world would be covered by a thick layer of clouds . He also told me not to be discouraged , because you would come to help us . Excuse me , I wasn 't a big help . I 'm sorry . I made you work hard . Please forgive me . Where is your husband now ? He flew away . He flew away ? When the Shinsengumi launched the first Adam Junior Bomb , he told me ... there was something he had to do . He left , still watching me , while I cried in the rain of ashes from the clouds . And he flew away . And he disappeared in an enormous whirlwind in the sky . What ? I 'm sorry , is there something on my face ? My love ! Once again , the clouds ... let the red light of sunset through . It 's such a wonderful memory ! Unfortunately , this could be the last sunset on Earth . Goodbye , sunlight . Goodbye ... forever . The Adam Juniors are used up . But we won 't let the sun shine . We have to start using the Adam Special tonight . My love ! How do you feel ? Who is that ? Listen to your conscience . It was me that brought you here . Then ... Then you 're a slave of the time machine . Okay , I don 't care , call me what you want . I 'm really the ex-electricity pole boy ! What happens is , every time an era ends , there 's an electricity pole boy . It 's the electricity pole boy that saves the world , by turning on a light at the end of every era , and joining that era to the next one . It 's his destiny . In other words , he 's a hero that saves history ! A hero ? I lit the light at the end of Edo era , but I couldn 't find a successor . I was upset , and travelled back and forth in time . Now 25 years have passed . But how can such a weak person as you save history ? Damn it ! Come on ! Get up and fight , electricity pole boy ! If you don 't fight , the world will remain in darkness . For eternity ! Come on , day is coming ! Isn 't it ready yet ? I don 't know why , but the machine 's not working . Eva ... Did Eva really have her first menstruation ? You saw that red blood too , didn 't you ? Isn 't it the blood from you violating Eva when she was still a virgin ? What are you saying ! Tell me the truth ! Hurry up ! - Hurry up and get Adam working ! - No , it 's not ready yet ! If you don 't hurry up , our bodies will turn to ashes ! Eva is dying ! Ochida ! I have to join them ! I 'll join Adam and Eve ! Here 's your partner , Eva ! Go , Adam Special ! Make darkness come ! Professor , be careful ! Help ! Professor ! Professor ! Momo ? " Me at age 15 . " This is Momo . It says " Sariba " ! It 's Momo 's last name ! The Professor ... was Momo ! She was full of life . Momo was so full of life ! I didn 't think she would die like this ! I didn 't save her . I didn 't save Momo ! Professor Sariba ... I 'm sorry ! Impossible ! It 's not time yet ! Eva ! I 'm sorry . Thank you for connecting the light to the electricity pole , electricity pole boy ! If you hadn 't been able to turn on the light , the darkness would have erased the world and all history ! You really did well ! The light that I turned on is about to go out , because it can light only one era . Now it 's your turn . You have to travel in time and search for the new electricity pole boy . When he has turned on a new light , your duty will be done ! The light of one era will go out , and another will turn on immediately . Light is beautiful ! The story of the world goes on ! We have to make it go on ! The story continues ! We have to make it go on ! They told me a lot about you . I was there fighting the vampires too . My mother told the truth . You saved the world . Momo ? I 'm Momo Sariba 's daughter ... and yours too . What happened ? I 'd like to know too ! I didn 't know you were here , with that thing on your back ! But aren 't you Momo ? What happened ? You 're Momo , right ? You 're strange . What a character ! History repeats itself . A difficult time will arrive soon . Like Professor Sariba said , and Eva 's man said , when the time comes , I have to attack Eva . Or the world will be destroyed ! We 'll be patient , Momo . The electricity pole boy will surely come to save you . It 's ... It 's sure . He will come to save you , even if he changes the course of history . That 's the way it has to be ! There 's no other way ! Do you have a fever ? I will always see you shining brightly like this , just like in the photo album . And I 'll take care of you . Professor Sariba 's photo album will always be like new . Let 's go ! - What did you do ? - The album is gone . Take care of yourself . Of course I will !

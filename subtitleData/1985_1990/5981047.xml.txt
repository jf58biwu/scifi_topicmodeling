 [ tires screeching ] [ explosion ] [ music continues ] [ tires screeching ] [ explosion ] [ music continues ] [ wind whooshing ] [ intense music ] [ rumbling ] [ whooshing ] [ thud ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ chattering continues ] Now I see why T.J. transferred to gemology . [ chuckling ] Earth to T.J. Come in , T.J. [ snaps fingers ] Hey , you 're blocking my view . Whoa , I didn 't know you had such interest in gems and minerals . Well , minerals , no , but , uh , that Ronnie Lawler that 's a gem I wouldn 't mind exploring every facet of . Forget it , Teej . She 's gone , man . ( Lana ) Yup , she 's fallen head over heels for Lex Luthor . Heaven only knows why . ( Lana ) I thought she was smarter than that . [ moaning ] You know , Lex , we 've done so much in the last few days . What the , the helicopter ride and the yacht trip , everything . I feel so lucky . And you should , my dear . It 's ... not every girl who gets noticed by Lex Luthor . Well , I 'm very selective . ( male # 1 ) Very selective . [ door opens ] Sorry I 'm late , class . But I just received a remarkable parcel from my associates in Addis Ababa . And I wanted to share their discovery with you all . I am pleased to say .. ... that we have found .. ... an energy-radiating meteorite . It shattered upon impact with the Earth and is like nothing man has ever seen before . In fact , we believe it may be an actual fragment of another world . A world , which in all probability was destroyed by an incredible explosion which propelled these stones through the cosmos right here to Earth . - Excuse me . - Clark ! ( Lana ) Clark , are you alright ? I 've never felt like this before . ( Lana ) Clark ! Are you okay , Clark ? [ intense music ] Stand back . Stand back . Please , give him some room . - Ah .. - Oh , Clark . Oh , that poor guy . Yeah , he fell like a ton of bricks . - Did you see it , Lex ? - Shut up , Leo , I 'm thinking . Sure , I know you don 't like me to talk while you 're thinking . You 're the boss and when the boss tells me to shut up , I do . You don 't have to tell me twice because I 'm pretty smart about things like that . That 's what I like about you , Leo . You always do everything exactly the way I tell you . Uh-uh-uh , stay put , son . A fall like that could give you a concussion or worse . I 've called the infirmary , where are they ? ( Clark ) No . No doctors , no hospitals , please . Please . He 's avoided doctors ever since we were kids . He 's weird that way . Veronica , my sweet . - I 'm feeling better . - It was scary . One minute you were sitting there and the next you were , you were out of it . ( T.J. ) Well , anyway , you 're okay now , right ? Yeah . [ dramatic music ] I knew it was just a matter of time before I got what I wanted , Leo . - Do you know why ? - Because you 're lucky , Lex ? No , no , no , luck has nothing to do with it , Leo . People like me ... deserve everything we get . [ snapping fingers ] - You need us , Mr. Luthor ? - I certainly do . Remember that machine you guys made for me about a month ago ? What was it you called it ? An electro-polarity discharger . The one we couldn 't find a power supply for ? Plutonium isn 't easy to come by and no way it 'll run without it . Just bring the machine here . I think I 've got something better than plutonium . Leo , my man , turn on the music , please . Something dramatic , I think . Perhaps a little Grieg . Peer Gynt Suite 1 , Op. 46 , if you don 't mind . You got it , boss man . [ knocking on door ] [ " Peer Gynt Suite No.1 , Op.46 " on player ] Excellent boys , settle up . [ music continues ] Mm ... what is it ? Power . [ music continues ] [ beeping ] [ beeping ] [ music intensifies ] [ buzzing ] [ music continues ] [ crackling ] Oh ... oh , uh .. - We didn 't mean it . - It was an accident . - It 's never happened before . - I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . [ laughing ] Don 't be ridiculous , boys . We finally got your invention working . And that 's cause for celebration . W-w-will there be girls there ? When the lights go out all over the town there 'll be so much confusion and panic . [ chuckling ] You 'll be able to walk right in and take anything your little nerdy heart desires , Oswald . Leo , mobilize my frat boys . First National Bank ought to be easy pickings . Don 't forget about the cash boxes . They ought to be ripe . And the finest jewelry stores in town . [ intense music ] Gentlemen , tonight we paint this town black . And then rob it blind . [ music on radio ] - I 'm gonna do it . - Do what , T.J. ? I 'm gonna ask Ronnie out . If she 'd just give me a shot she 'd see that I was way cooler than Lex . Go for it , what you got to lose ? Huh , my head . I mean , if Lex sends one of his goons after me . ( man on radio ) Looks like we 're experiencing technical difficulties here at Radio Station W-E-I-L . Some kind of power surge . We 've got turn ta .. There 's trouble at the electric plant , I bet . [ buzzing ] Oh , no , no , I don 't want you fainting again . Come on , come on . I 'll cover for you , buddy . [ theme music ] [ buzzing ] It 's working , it 's working ! Look out , girls , here we come . [ theme music ] [ buzzing ] [ music continues ] [ sizzling ] He-he-he grounded it . Let 's get out of here before he does the same thing to us . [ sizzling continues ] Great , hold that pose ! [ camera clicks ] Beautiful . [ sizzling continues ] [ camera clicking ] T.J. , get out of here , this thing could blow any minute ! T.J. I-I 'm okay ... how are you ? I 'm a little buzzed , but it 's wearing off . [ telephone ringing ] Luthor here . What is going on over there ? All of my lights are still on . What ? Superboy lit up like a Christmas tree ? Forget the girls ! Contact the frat boys immediately . Tell them the heist is postponed indefinitely . No , no , dump the machine , but save the rock . You did ? Good . Because I 'm sure I 'll find another use for it once the heat dies down . And I think I have just the place to keep it .. [ intense music ] ... where no one will ever think to look . [ laughing ] [ bell donging ] Ronnie , hey . Hey , Ronnie . Oh , hi , T.J. Hey , how 's Clark ? Gosh , it was a nasty fall he had the other day . Well , now he 's okay . He 's always doing things like that . Yeah ? He should take better care of himself . - Lana and I look out for him . - Yeah ? Listen , Ronnie , I was thinking maybe you and I we can go out sometime , you know , maybe a pizza and a movie ? Pizza and a movie ? Oh , I mean , that sounds nice , but .. I can 't , I mean , I don 't think Lex would understand that . Uh , no offence here , Ronnie but Lex Luthor isn 't exactly Mr. Popularity here at Shuster . You see , nobody knows Lex like I do . He 's , he 's kind , considerate , generous- - Arrogant , obnoxious- - No , no , that 's just a defense , T.J. to hide how shy he really is . ( Lex ) Why , Veronica that is the nicest thing anyone has ever said of me . And speaking of generous .. [ snaps fingers ] For me ? Oh , Lex , you shouldn 't have . [ intense music ] Oh , it 's beautiful . Of course , it 's not an actual space stone . It 's just a remarkable simulation . - I had it made just for you . - Aww . Lex , how can I ever thank you ? I 'll think of something , my dear . [ chuckling ] What happened ? I just got stepped on by tyrannosaurus Lex . Veronica , my darling . Your necklace look particularly beautiful by candlelight . Oh , my necklace . - Well , what about me ? - I was coming to that . But first .. ... Chicken flambe a la Luthor . Oh ... oh , my , Lex . You keep outdoing yourself . Nothing but the finest for you , my dear . [ chuckling ] Have I told you the story of how I came upon this tantalizing recipe ? [ telephone ringing ] What ? You know I 'm busy . Okay , make it fast . The police ? But how could they find the machine ? I specifically told those idiots to lose it . Dammit ! This is gonna be serious . - Lex , what 's wrong ? - Those blithering idiots ! - Who ? - I don 't wanna talk about it . - But who are you mad at ? - Shut up , Veronica . Hey , Lex ! I said , I don 't wanna talk about it ! [ clattering ] [ intense music ] [ crackling ] - Professor . - Oh , Clark . How nice to bump into you . I 've gotta get somewhere fast . Make haste slowly , don 't always be running . [ alarm ringing ] [ whooshes ] [ ringing continues ] [ crackling ] Let 's get out of here ! [ thud ] [ crackling continues ] [ dramatic music ] ( Lex ) We 're trapped . No . Heat rises . Let 's get on the floor . [ dramatic music ] [ thud ] [ crackling ] Oh ! [ intense music ] [ thud ] [ crackling ] - Lex , we gotta help him . - You help him ! I 'm outta here . [ music continues ] Superboy ! Superboy ! Come on ! Superboy ! [ alarm ringing ] [ coughing ] - Lex , you 're okay ? - I 'm fine , I 'm fine . But the rock is still in there . Oh , no , I 'm not going up there . Be a sport , Leo , and get it back . Don 't make me say please . I 'm not going up there . [ ringing continues ] [ siren blaring ] [ blaring continues ] [ crackling ] [ dramatic music ] [ crackling continues ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] Put me down ! - Come on ! - I got the girl , Lex . You didn 't tell me Superboy was in there too . Forget them , where 's my necklace ? Oh , you left me up there to die and you are worried about your stupid necklace ? You are worse than scum , Lex . You are murderous scum ! A boyhood ambition of mine . I always was an overachiever . [ chuckling ] I never wanna see you again , Lex Luthor ! [ Lex chuckling ] - Not just yet , my pretty . - What ? Oh , you want this piece of junk , huh ? Huh ? Just take it ! [ dramatic music ] No ! [ splashing ] No ! No ! I 'm Lex Luthor . This can 't happen to Lex Luthor ! [ indistinct chattering ] Well , at least , I 'm rid of Superboy forever . ( Superboy ) Looking for something , Lex ? No , no , no , uh .. [ camera clicks ] [ T.J. chuckling ] I know you 're trying to impress Veronica but don 't you think this is going a little too far ? [ laughing ] No , I like a man with style . Oh , do you hear that , Lex ? Hey , how about one more ? And this time say cheese . [ grunts ] You 're looking good , Lex . ( male # 2 ) I 'm sure the lead shielding will protect you . ( Superboy ) I still wish I knew where they came from . Well , we may never know . And though they may be of value to mankind you say the risk to you is too great . Well , something tells me you will be an important force to mankind in the future . More important than any stones . Thank you , professor . I know just the way of getting rid of these ... forever . ( male # 2 ) That was every last piece of it . [ theme music ] [ creaking ] [ music continues ] [ whooshing ] ( male # 2 ) That was every last piece of it . [ sloshing ] ( Superboy ) I only wish I could be so sure . [ theme music ] [ theme music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

 They arrived in 50 Mother Ships ... offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth . Skeptical of the Visitors ... Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks ... and soon discovered some startling secrets . They 're shipping food ! The Resistance is all that stands between us ... and the Visitors . You want me to take it for a while ? You 've been driving since midnight . Yeah , good idea . I 'll get us off these back roads , and you can take it from there . I hope the Tucson Resistance hasn 't been wiped out in this Phoenix sweep . No , those desert rats are tough . If we get this load of hardware to them by tomorrow , they stand a good chance . Two hundred machine guns ought to do something for their morale . - Police ? - You got to be kidding me . Half the world 's falling apart , and they 're handing out tickets ? Stash the hardware . Keep it handy , though . You never can tell about these guys , especially out here . Plant it right there , fellas . Hands on top of your heads . You boys in a big rush ? I 'm sorry . Highway 's straight as a string , and we 're due in Tucson tomorrow . - I guess it just sort of crept up on us . - Yeah , I guess it did . Now , you want to open that back end ? - Come on , what is this ? - This is a toll road now . Toll road ? Yeah , that 's right . We take care of the lizards around here . But that costs . How much ? Just exactly half of whatever you got . Now you want to open up that back end or do you want some real trouble ? Open up . Grab the rope , Kyle . Let 's give them what they want . Come on , Kyle ! There is a crossfire . Let 's get out of here ! Thanks . Gee , I don 't believe I got the name . Kathy Courtney . This is my place . - Who are you ? - Donovan . Mike Donovan . This is my friend , Kyle Bates . I could be wrong , but I think those guys were trying to shake us down . Figures . They 've all but shut this area down . - Collaborators . - They cut a deal . The guy with the beard , that was Carnes . He 's the enforcer for Big John Roland . When the Visitors attacked , the folks here put up a good fight ... until Roland sold us out . You guys are with the Resistance , aren 't you ? - How can you tell ? - You 've got guns . Roland 's confiscated most of them around here . But fortunately , not all of them . Yeah , fortunately for us . I think we 're going to be late with this shipment to Tucson . I hear the fighting 's pretty bad down there . You will need help if you 're going to make it to Tucson in that . Lady 's got a point . Yeah , she 's also got a tractor to help pull you out . Tell you what we 'll do . We 'll trade you some guns and ammo for a pull with that tractor . You got a deal . And how is the prisoner this morning ? You 're the criminal , Diana , and you know it . Still unrepentant . Unwilling to admit your obvious guilt . It was you who killed Charles . No , darling , it was I who married Charles . You murdered him . Now you must pay for your crime . But in the spirit of fairness ... I 've decided to offer you a choice . You can either suffer the indignity of trial or go out the noble way . Commit suicide . You evil ... If you 're still with us in the morning ... you will face swift and unmerciful judgment . Try to show a little character , Lydia . You have nothing to gain from cowardice . Here . You may need this . Find everything okay ? Yeah , fine , thanks . Kyle 's just finishing up outside . Something smells good . I thought you and your friend might be hungry . Yeah , we are . Here , let me give you a hand with that . You 're married . Where 's your husband ? He died when the lizards came in . Sorry . They hit us pretty hard . And Dave was killed in the last of the fighting . He stood for what he believed in . Pickup 's alive and kicking . Dinner . - Are we invited ? - You bet . - Let 's go finish unloading first . - Good idea . Hold it right there . - Anything you say . - Who are you ? I 'll ask the questions . Back in ! Who sent you ? Roland ? Jesse , put that down . They 're friends . Kyle , Mike ... Jesse , my daughter . Daughter ? - It 's nice to meet you , Jesse . - Same here . What are they doing here ? They 're having supper with us . Now you just wash up . I don 't think she trusts you , Mike . She doesn 't trust anybody anymore . I can 't say that I blame her . There 's nobody left to trust around here . They 've worn people down . They 're collecting what they call taxes for the lizards . Food mostly . They want our horses , but I won 't pay it . Are you the only one resisting ? The others are afraid . They 've got no leader ... nobody to look up to . And the next collection day is day after tomorrow . No lizard 's going to eat our horses . Right , Mom ? You bet , Jesse . So , you guys are real lizard fighters ? When we have to be . Maybe we can get some while you 're here , then . This kid is good material . - We could use you in a couple years . - I 'm ready right now . Jesse . Lord , bless this house , and these , thy gifts . And don 't forget those who must fight to protect them . Amen . Let 's eat . Would you like to do the honors ? You 're telling me , they drove you off out there ? We got caught in a crossfire . Up near the Courtney place . That woman again . We should 've killed her and her daughter ... when the Visitors got her old man . I don 't need dead martyrs ... not if we 're going to meet the quota the Visitors want . If we don 't deliver her horses like we promised ... the Visitors are gonna deliver us . Roland , she don 't care . She ain 't scared yet . Then it 's up to us to change it , isn 't it ? What about the other two in the pickup ? We never got close enough to find out . If it was the Courtney woman , we 'll have to do something about it . Maybe you ought to take a ride back out there and deliver a little message . It 'll bring everybody back in line . Couldn 't manage it , Lydia ? You always were a pathetic weakling . The scorpion ? I ate it . But I saved the best part for you . Prepare her for trial . Sure you won 't stay the night ? Thanks . But we 've lost too much time already . Where 'd you want us to put the guns and ammo ? In the barn . Jesse will show you where to put them . She 's feeding the horses . I 'll be right back . I wish you would stay . Weapons aren 't much good without men to fire them . There must be somebody . The Resistance needs a leader . You seem pretty capable . When my husband was killed ... it took the fight out of just about everybody around here . They need somebody new . Somebody from the outside . Look out ! Get down ! - Mom , you all right ? - Yeah . Everybody 's fine . - It 's just another one of Roland 's tricks . - Really ? I think you 're right . You do need somebody to stick around a while . I think you 'd better make the run to Tucson alone . I 'll hang in here a couple of days ... - help these folks organize a bit . - Good enough . - I 'll see you back in LA . - Take care . What 's for breakfast ? All right ! You 've heard the evidence against ... ex-Fleet Adjutant Commander Lydia . Have you reached a verdict ? No ! You can 't do this ! I have had no opportunity to make my case ! Silence ! You have no case . You heard the facts . The verdict ! - It 's against the law ! - Enough ! The verdict , now . We find Lydia guilty of the murder ... of Commander Charles , and sentence you to death . No ! You can 't do this ! Take her away and prepare her for execution . Too bad , Lydia . But at least you were tried . Looks like two vehicles . Eight , maybe nine men were here last night . Deputy Carnes never comes empty-handed . We were lucky you were with us . We 're down to our last 20 head now . And Roland wants half of those for his lizard taxes . - What will he do if you don 't pay ? - I don 't know . Steal them , have them shot , maybe . The point is , I can 't give in . Jesse would never forgive me . What would happen if nobody in this whole valley paid those taxes ? I don 't know . Point is , they wouldn 't have the firepower to force us ... if we could stand together . Then let 's make that happen . Call your neighbors together , I 'll talk to them . Are you saying that you would commit to lead us ? Because that 's what it would take . All right , it 's worth a try . Skyfighter coming this way . Looks like he spotted us . Come on ! - You okay ? - It just knocked the wind out of me . Stay here , keep out of sight . I 'll try to lead him off . Mike , no ! Hello , Lydia . - You always looked well in black . - I prefer to watch . How courageous of you . Any last requests ? Only to reiterate my innocence . I didn 't kill Charles , Diana , and you know it . Unfortunately , the court concluded that you did . Arm the disintegrator . I want to get this over with once and for all . Excuse me , Commander , we may have a problem . The Inspector General has just docked in the landing bay . He wasn 't scheduled to arrive till tomorrow . The Inspector General will have your head for this , Diana . Release me at once ! He received the judges ' brief in transit . He 's familiar with the case . Proceed . Quickly ! You wouldn 't dare . How long have we known each other ? Prepare for termination . Stop ! Let her go . You must be Diana . My brother Martin has told me much about you . I am Philip ... Inspector General ... special envoy from our Leader . The resemblance between you and your brother is uncanny . Martin and I were developed from a mutual zygote . If it hadn 't been for your brother 's heroism in freeing me ... I could never have returned to my fleet . So I 've been told . He died a terrible death at the hands of the humans . We 'll deal with my brother 's death at another time . First we must deal with the death of Charles . Lydia has been tried and found guilty of his murder . That may be . However ... the Leader feels that justice would be better served ... if I conduct an impartial investigation . Thank you , Inspector General . I 'm very grateful to you and the Leader . Reserve your gratitude . It may be premature . Now , if you ladies will excuse me , I 'd like to get right to work . By all means . You are hereby freed ... pending , of course , the outcome of my investigation . Nice try , Diana . I 'll see you destroyed for this . I 'm afraid everybody who 's coming is already here . I knew none of those chickens would show up ! Who is it ? It 's Joe ! - Hiya , Joe . - Hey there , Jesse . Come on in . Mike , this is Joe Sampson . He owns the ranch down the road . - Glad to meet you . Thanks for coming . - I 'm thanking you . It 's high time somebody stood up to Roland and his lizard bunch . I hear you 've got quite a reputation with the LA Resistance . Don 't let this stump fool you . I still got plenty of fight left in me . I hate to sound pessimistic , but I don 't see how this thing can work ... - just the three of us . - Three ? Any resistance starts with a dedicated group of individuals . I think that 's us . Are you saying that you 're going to see this through all the way ? Seems to me he 's got lots of incentive . - The question is , do you have a plan ? - As a matter of fact , I do . It has come to my attention that there is significant reason to believe ... that Lydia had no intention whatsoever of murdering Charles . Really ? Then perhaps she 'd care to explain ... why she purchased half a liter of cat poison . I think the reason is obvious , Diana . She intended to murder you . However , the fact that she was unsuccessful ... does not give you the right to make a mockery of our system of justice ... and sentence her to death . Are you saying that the intention to murder is not a crime ? What I 'm saying , Diana , is that you have violated legal procedure . Therefore , Lydia is entitled to a new trial . Under existing legal codes ... a trial by combat between accused ... and accuser . Do you wish to exercise this right , Lydia ? I couldn 't be more eager . Then tomorrow you will meet ... in combat , to the death . That guy with the Courtney woman ... I 've seen him somewhere before . As a matter of fact , I 'm sure of it . Carnes , hand me those packages . That 's him . Mike Donovan . He 's wanted by the Visitors . Shoot on sight . - You sure that 's him ? - Like my life depended on it . Then I know just the fellow we should be talking to . What incredible stupidity ... to lose a skyfighter chasing one man on horseback . But the pilot radioed back he was chasing Donovan . And if I know Donovan , it probably was a trap . If that pilot hadn 't died in the crash , I would have had him drawn and scalded . Lieutenant James ! Yes . What is it ? Excellent . Have my skyfighter made ready at once . This time we know where Donovan is ... and I will personally see to it that he is destroyed . Everything okay , Willie ? It is all cleared out . - You okay ? - Yes . I 'm fine . I am none the worse for air . Wear , Willie . Worse for wear . Right , wear . Thank you . I 've been monitoring a transmission from the Visitor Fifth Column . - Donovan and Kyle are in real trouble . - What kind of trouble ? It seems that James has found out ... and he and his raiders are about to hunt them down . We 've got to warn them . I don 't even know where they are . Cactus Flower , come in . This is Hedgehog . Cactus Flower , come in , please . I have never been defeated in mortal combat . Idiot . If you had , you 'd be dead . A bit touchy , aren 't we , Diana ? - I 'm not afraid to die in battle . - Good , Lydia . Fear of the inevitable is useless . It is time . May justice prevail . I don 't understand it , but the Tucson unit said Kyle delivered the guns alone . Then what happened to Donovan ? I left him at a farmhouse just west of San Bernardino . I should go away more often . Somehow James found out that Donovan is out there . - He 's gone after him already . - You sure ? - Yeah , I 'm sure . - He 's gonna need help . Wait a minute , you 're still on injured reserve . Come on , Kyle , it 's just a ... Julie , to be honest with you , in your condition you 're not gonna be much help . Besides , somebody 's got to hold down the fort . - I guess you 're right . Be careful . - Okay , Mom . Let 's go . Mom ? Get out of here ! - Joe ? - Yeah . Well ? What do you think of Donovan ? I 'd say he is okay . Smart young fella . Tough , too . - Think he 'll stay around ? - That 's hard to say . Nowadays it seems like you can 't count on anything . In war , Jesse , you can 't afford to get too attached to anybody . - Especially ... - How 's it going ? Ready for inspection . Well , I 'm going for coffee . Anybody else ? I may join you in a minute , Joe . Let 's see . - Where 'd you learn to clean a gun ? - My dad taught me . That was his . I 'll bet he wished you never had to use it . That 's what I would wish for my son . You have kids ? Just one . About your age . I wonder what it would be like , having a brother . You like it here ? - There 's a lot to like . - Good . 'Cause I really could use somebody ... to help me ... Take care of your mother ? Dad made me promise to take care of her . I do pretty good ... but you could do better . I 've waited a long time for this . I wish I had known , I would 've accommodated you much sooner . Take a deep breath , it may be your last . I 'm gonna miss looking into those scheming eyes of yours . - I think I 'll kill you very slowly . - I 'd hate to disappoint you , Diana . No man will look at your face when I 'm through with you . No more ! I said no more ! It 's my right ! I have hereby suspended your combat to the death ... until I 'm certain which one of you has killed Charles . You heard the orders . Consider yourself fortunate that you survived . Roland . - A Visitor spaceship just set down . - Took his time , didn 't he ? What are they for ? See , that 's why you 'll never amount to squat , Carnes . You don 't know the first thing about diplomats . Shoot , they ain 't diplomats . They 're rats . Have you got Donovan ? No , but we know exactly where he is . First , though , I 'd like to present you with a special token of my ... I said , have you captured Donovan ? No , we were waiting on you . Rats . A bit gamy for my taste , but if you insist . To Donovan . Quite good . - Where 's your mama , where 's Donovan ? - Out bringing in the horses . Why ? A bunch of lizards has come to town led by a guy named James . They 're gunning for Donovan . What are you doing ? Where are you going ? Jesse ! What do you think you 're doing ? Like you said , in war you have to do what you have to do . Wait , Jesse . Donovan ! Maybe he 's in the barn . I 'll check it out . You two check the house , see if anybody 's inside . And be careful . Put your hands up , or I 'll fill you so full of lead you 'll think you 're a pencil ! - Which one of you did that ? - She did . You got some touch , lady . That 's as a quick a shot I ever saw . Wait a minute . You got no gun . Where 's Mike Donovan ? - Donovan ? Are you with him ? - That 's right . Someone 's coming . Look who 's here . Thought maybe you could use some help . Right now , I wouldn 't turn it down . How are you doing ? - Good . Everything okay ? - We 're holding it together here . Kathy Courtney , I want you to meet some people . That 's Willie . That 's Elizabeth . You know Kyle . I see you all have met Old Joe . Where 's Jesse ? - It 's my fault . - Fault ? What 're you talking about ? A bunch of lizards came in at Roland 's ... I came out to warn you . Some guy named James . - He didn 't get Jesse , did he ? - Not exactly . - It 's more like she decided to get him . - What ? She took your.30-30 and headed for town before I could stop her . - I 've got to find Jesse . - No . We 've got to stop her . The Resistance , remember ? You said the Courtney ranch is due west . Straight out County Line Road , you can 't miss it . Want me to come along ? - No , I think we can handle it . - I 'd offer to drive you out . If the fight is faster , one single strike will settle the matter . You lizards got style . I like that . Don 't lick my boots . I 'm just liable to step on your throat . Well , well . What have we got here ? Your lasers looked dangerous , so I fixed them . Just the way my dad taught me . So I see . Too bad he didn 't teach you to respect other people 's property , little girl . He tried , but he was killed . By Visitors . I want to even the score . You 've come to the right place . No . I 'll take care of it . All right , I brought the horses . Now you leave me and my daughter alone . - Check them out . - Right . You can 't give in now . I know what I am doing . Jesse , please . Never mess with a vet . - Are you okay ? - We 're fine . We did it ! We drove them off ! - You bet . - Yes , we did . - Joe , thanks for the assist . - Any time . Boy , that brought back memories . I better be getting back to my place . - Now you take care . - You , too . And you 're welcome by my flier anytime . Thanks . That goes for me , too . You really gave those lizards the business . They still could come back you know . Yeah , but we will be ready for them . We 're the Resistance now . You take care of your mom now , you hear ? Mike ! I don 't want you to go . Sweetheart , we all have a job to do . And your responsibility is to do what your dad asked before he died . You got to take care of your mom , okay ? I still don 't want you to go . I don 't want to go . There are people who need me , though . More than my mom and me ? You grow up straight and strong now , you hear ? When the war is over , will you come back ? At least to visit us ? Wild horses couldn 't keep me away . How fortunate Philip stopped the combat when he did . - Fortunate for whom ? - For you , of course . Another minute , and the war would 've been over as far as you 're concerned . Self-delusion is a very dangerous game , Lydia . If you 'd been paying attention ... you 'd have realized that I 'd just begun my attack . Of course . And like most of your attacks , you began it on your back , in the slime . How could I forget ? Next time you step into the quagmire , I 'll make certain you never step out . There may not be a next time . - It must be finished . - Why not ? Ladies , please . We 're not animals here . A set of prints was found on the bottle of poison used to murder Charles . The interesting thing about the set of prints is ... they don 't belong to Lydia . Are you saying that Lydia had an accomplice ? There was no conspiracy . She killed him . Enough ! And to prevent this situation from going any further ... I 've decided to invoke the inter-guardian rule . - Inter-guardian rule ? - You can 't be serious . But I am . Until I unravel this case , you are going to be each other 's keepers . Should anything happen to one , the blame automatically falls on the other . Your fates are entwined ... like two serpents in a single skin . I suggest you act accordingly . What about my rank ? I 've contacted the Leader . He requires that you both resume the posts you held under Charles . - Then I must report to her ? - The Leader is wise . And you must report to me . Ladies . I want copies of all your files on my desk as soon as possible , darling . You 'll get everything you deserve , Lydia , and much more . English

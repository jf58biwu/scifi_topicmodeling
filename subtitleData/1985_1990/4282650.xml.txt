 This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf , The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak , The only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold , Revived three million years later , Lister 's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew , We 've enough food to last 30,000 years , but there 's only one After Eight mint left , and everyone 's too polite to take it , Let 's see ... " Astronavigation and Engineering Structure Made Simple " . That 's Rimmer 's . Ah-ha ! " The Pop-Up Kama Sutra . " Zero Gravity Edition . " That 's mine . " Arnold J Rimmer - A Tribute . " What 's this ? - It 's a video of my death . - You videoed your death ? - Holly did it for me . - You 're strange , Rimmer . Why ? You have videos of weddings and births . So , you have people around and invite them to watch you snuff it ? My death is one of the most important things that ever happened to me . - Weird ! - What about these posters ? - They 're mine . - But the Blu-Tack is mine . - You want the Blu-Tack ? - It is mine . I paid for it . There 's one of your old toenail clippings under the bed . This is the best decision I ever made . No more of your stupid face . - No more of your stupid habits . - Me ? What did I do ? You hummed . Maliciously and persistently for two years . Every time I sat down to revise ... Are you saying you never became an officer because I hummed ? Obviously not just that , Lister . Everything ! - Everything you ever did held me back . - Like what ? Like using my mother 's photograph as an ashtray . I didn 't know ! I thought it was a souvenir from Titan Zoo . Exchanging the symbols on my revision timetable , so instead of taking Engineering finals , I went swimming . The symbols fell off . I thought I put them back right . Swapping my toothpaste for a tube of contraceptive jelly . Come on ! That was a joke . Yes , Lister , like putting my name on the waiting list for experimental pile surgery . It 's not all one-way , Rimmer . - You 're hardly Mr Easy-To-Live-With . - What are you talking about ? You playing your self-hypnosis tapes all night . " Learn Esperanto While You Sleep . " " Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep . " - We both got the same benefit . - Yeah , neither of us slept . You tied me hair to the bedpost , then sounded the fire alarm ! I was sick of you annoying me . I don 't have to explain . I nearly needed brain surgery ! What brains ? The point is , you 've always stopped me being successful . Rimmer , you can 't blame me for your lousy life . - Oh , yes , I can . - It 's always the same . You never had the right pens . Your dividers don 't stretch far enough . - Well , they don 't ! - See ? You can 't say , " I buggered up my life . It 's all Lister 's fault ! " Well , I 'm not , am I ? I 'm moving out . Out of Slob City and into Successville . - What ? Next door ? - It 's not the place , it 's the company . I 'm sharing with someone who 'll give me encouragement and understanding , the thrust and parry of meaningful conversation . - Everything tickety-boo ? - Absolutement , Mr Rimmer . I 'll be along lickety-split . Carry on ! What a guy ! Why didn 't I think of this before ? Another me . Yeah , yeah ... Shall I take this through ? Be careful with that . It 's an antique . It 's absolutely priceless . " Absolutement " , " tickety-boo " , " lickety-split " ... God , meaningful conversation ! " Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer and Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer . " Be careful with that . It 's an antique . It 's absolutely priceless . - Gosh , I just said that ! - Did you ? That 's incredible ! What a lovely story ! Why have you got " No smoking " signs ? Neither of you smoke . Because they 're our signs and we happen to think they look rather striking . Whoa-ho-ho ! What 's all this ? " Arnold 's Tops With Us " , " Arnie Does It Best " ... This is very funny stuff . - Just go . - Because your name 's Arnold Rimmer , and even though these headlines are about other people , you 've put them on the wall , so people think they 're about you ? - Shoo ! Go on , out ! - This 'll keep me laughing all winter ! We don 't have to put up with your snidey remarks , your socks that set off the sprinkler system . - Vacate our new quarters . - Bye-bye , Rimmer . No , sorry ... Bye-bye , bye-bye , Rimmer , Rimmer . Goit . Aow ! Hey ! I 'm looking so good today ! If I looked any better , I 'd be illegal ! Hello , hello ! Testing , testing ! One , one , one ! Me , me , me !

They 're going right where they belong , all over the floor , where any self-respecting bachelor would keep ' em . I can have the bottom bunk , the big bunk . I 'm gonna leave the top off the shampoo . I 'm going to squeeze the toothpaste right from the middle . In fact , I 'm gonna do all the things that drove him bonkers ! I 'm gonna crack me knuckles . I 'm gonna grind me teeth . I 'm gonna live for a change ! Ooh , smeggin ' hell ! What 's this ? Video of Rimmer 's death ? Holly , get us some popcorn and put the video on , would you ? Well , I can just about manage that , I suppose , " BSc " , " SSc " ? What 's that ? Bronze Swimming certificate and Silver Swimming certificate . He 's a total lunatic . Hello . This video pays homage to a man who fell short of greatness by a gnat 's wing . Before we see a digitalised recording of his final moments , there 'll be a lengthy tribute , interspersed with poetry read by me . Whoa ! Spin on ! Poetry in motion . .. and if it hadn 't been for those people who kept dragging him down , pulling him back ... Spin on ! .. if you put Napoleon in quarters with Lister , he 'd be in Corsica peeling spuds . Spin on ! .. we see the final moments of Arnold J Rimmer . Yes ! It was your job to fix it , Rimmer ! You can 't do sloppy work . I know , sir , and I accept full responsibility for any consequences . Emergency , There 's an emergency going on , Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry to White Corridor 159 ... ? Gazpacho soup ! Off . Gazpacho soup ? Why were his last words " gazpacho soup " ? Attention , lady cats ! Sensual emergency ! Good lovin ' needed bad ! Aow ! Hey , no girls here ? What a waste of a good move ! Shame . I 'm looking so dangerous , too ! Aow ! Yeah , yeah ! Cat , what are you doing ? I 'm courting . Courting who ? - Whoever shows up . - I told you before , there 's no other cats on board . If I believed that for one minute , I 'd go crazy ! Aow ! Yeah , yeah ! Up , up , up ! Stretch , stretch , stretch ! - Stretch further ! - And rest . - No ! Keep jumping ! - Absolutely . Through the pain barrier . - Jump , jump , jump ! - And rest . - What are you doing ? ! - It 's going all grey ! - That 's the pain barrier ! Beat it ! - You 're absolutely right . - And rest . - Brilliant ! That extra little bit . - What time do we get up ? - Early . 8.30 . - No , earlier . 7.00 . - How about 6.00 ? - No , 4.30 . - That 's the middle of the night ! You wanted driving . I 'm driving you . Once again , you 're absolutely right . Holly , alarm call , 4.30 am . Make it the extra loud one . Yes , Arnold , And Arnold , - What are you doing , Arnold ? - I 'm going to bed , Arnold . It 's 2 am . We can get in some revision . I 'm getting up in a minute . You take Porous Circuits and Esperanto . I 'll take Thermal Energy and Philosophy . - Fantastic ! I 'm in heaven ! - Better than sex . It 's 4,30 , Here is your early morning alarm call , Off ! Off ! Off ! That 's it . Smooth and even . Up and down . Ah , Lister . Bonan matenon . Didn 't wake you , I trust ? No , I haven 't been to bed yet . But it 's 5.05 am . It 's practically lunchtime . What are you doing ? It 's called work , Lister . W - O-R-K . It is in the dictionary . Come on , paint ! Paint ! Why is it the same colour as before ? They 're changing it from ocean grey to military grey . - Looks exactly the same to me . - No , no , no , no ... That 's the new military grey bit there ... and that 's the dowdy old ocean grey there . Or is it the other way around ? It doesn 't matter . It 's very nice . So , how 's Mrs Rimmer ? Tee-hee ... Get into your cesspit or you won 't have the energy for a day 's slob . I just wondered what you talked about and that . Millions of things , Lister . Apart from being a genius , he 's a total delight . - He keeps me in stitches . - He knows everything you know , and vice versa , so what do you talk about ? We reminisce , chew over old times , past glories ... old girlfriends . - Oh , you mean Yvonne McGruder ? - Don 't say it as if she 's the only one . Name one other girlfriend , then . Lister , I 'm far , far too much of a gentleman to stoop to that shower-room mentality . All you need to know about Yvonne McGruder is I gave her one . Fine , Rimmer . Very nice . Very , very nice . So , um ... what 's gazpacho soup ? - What ? - They were your last words . Why ? You 've been watching my death video . That 's private ! It 's for my enjoyment only ! It just seems a strange thing to say , " Gazpacho soup . " I didn 't have time to bash out a speech in iambic pentameter . I was hit by an atomic explosion . But why " gazpacho soup " ? That is something you will never know . Arnold , you asked me to remind you about your Esperanto revision , Thank you , Holly . You two , carry on . " A to Z of Red Dwarf . " I thought so ! " My Diary " , by Arnold J Rimmer . January 1st : " I have decided to keep a journal of the coming year , " a daily chart of my progress through the echelons of command , " so that one day , other aspiring officers " may seek enlightenment in these pages .

It can wait till morning . I 'm just gonna sleep here . - Everything all right , is it ? - Sure . Absolutely . Yeah , sure . - No problems , then ? - No . No , no . Things couldn 't be hunky-dorier . It 's just I thought I heard , you know ... raised voices ? It 's quite an amusing thought , isn 't it ? Having a blazing row with yourself . Hit the wall ! Go on ! Hit the wall ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Shut up ! I 'm trying to sleep ! Obviously , we have professional disagreements , but nothing with anything to it . Nothing malicious . Shut up , you dead git ! Excuse me a second , Lister , will you ? Stop your foul whining , you filthy piece of distended rectum ! Lister , there 's no point in concealing it anymore .

Don 't ask me . He 's nothing to do with me . Last I saw , he was changing the paint back to ocean grey . He 's quite mad ! Lister . Cat . Excuse me . I can 't see . Shh . Excuse me , I can 't see through your stupid , sticky-out-eared head . - I 'm trying to watch the film ! - Yeah ! - Move ! - Look , I just chose a seat at random . If you 're unhappy , I suggest you move . Right . Now , where shall I sit ? So many to choose from . How about over there or over there ? No , that 's a nice seat ! Look at this . Mr Maturity . Will you two guys just grow up ? There 's only one immature person around here , and we all know who . Hello . What do you think of Arnold Rimmer ? This can 't go on . One of you has gotta go . Yes , him . - It 's clear which one has to go . - Yes , you ! I was here first . I nursed Listie through those early , delicate days ! We 're exactly the same person . Only you 're mentally unstable . Ippy-dippy , my spaceshippy , on a course so true ... Past Neptune and Pluto 's moon , the one I choose is you . - Excellent decision . - The one you end on stays , yeah ? - It 's you . - Wait a minute . Hold your horses . It 's your own fault , Rimmer . If you 'd given me Kochanski 's hologram , this wouldn 't have happened . Drive Room . Ten minutes . Drive Room . Five minutes . I don 't believe it . I 've been ippy-dippied to death . - I want you out . - What have I said ? Just out ! There 's precious little entertainment around here . If you can 't attend the odd execution , what have you got left ? Out ! Go on ! Don 't forget to write ... you great nancy ! Lister . Fancy a drink ? I didn 't know you had any medals ! What are they ? Three Years ' Long Service , Six Years ' Long Service , Nine Years ' Long Service , Twelve Years ' Long Service . - Come on , just one drink . - I 'll have a whisky . - Holly ? - How would you like it ? Straight ... with ice and lemonade , a cherry and a slice of lemon . Another ? And another . And another . Make it a double . So , what 's this gazpacho soup business ? What 's it all about ? I suppose now I 'm doomed , I can tell you . Gazpacho soup . It was the greatest night of my life . I 'd been invited to the Captain 's table . I 'd only been with the company 14 years . Six officers and me ! They called me " Arnold " . We had gazpacho soup for starters . I didn 't know gazpacho soup was meant to be served cold . I called over the chef and told him to take it away and bring it back hot . He did ! The looks on their faces still haunt me today ! I thought they were laughing at the chef , when they were laughing at me as I ate my piping hot gazpacho soup ! I never ate at the Captain 's table again . - That was the end of my career . - Anyone could 've done that . If only they 'd mentioned it in basic training ! Instead of climbing up and down ropes and crawling through tunnels . If only , just once , they 'd said , " Gazpacho soup is served cold ! " I could 've been an admiral by now ! Instead of a nothing , which is what I am , let 's face it . - Oh , you 're not a nothing . - He is . - You 're right ! - I know I 'm right . I never got off the bottom rung . And do you know why ? Because I didn 't have the right nobby parents . I bet Todhunter was served gazpacho soup the moment he was on solids . No , I bet he was breast-fed with it ! One side gazpacho soup and the other side dispensing chilled champagne ! Is this gonna go on all day ? I thought he was gettin ' wiped ! Yes , go on . Turn me off . Get rid of me . I 've already done it . I wiped the other one . What ? ! You wiped ... When ? ! - Just before you came in . - And you let me bare my soul ? Yeah ! I wanted to know about gazpacho soup . I knew you wouldn 't tell me . Of course I wouldn 't . You 'd make my life a hell with gazpacho soup jokes . Rimmer . I promise , I swear I will never , ever mention this conversation again . And when I swear , I mean it . - You promise ? - I promise . Do you swear absolutely ? I swear absolutely that I will never mention gazpacho soup again ! All right ... You 're a bit of a slob , but you keep your word . This time I 'm gonna believe you . Let 's go for another drink . Souper ! # It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

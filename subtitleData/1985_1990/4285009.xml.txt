 OK , OK ... Uphill , slight burrow to the left . Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Ow ! Hey ! Four up with six to play ! This guy is hot , hot , hot , hot ! OK , hole 13 . What am I doing ? What am I doing ? ! You 're not following through . Keep your head down and follow through ! - Why am I playing this ? - Because it 's Sunday . Time to relax . Time to chill . Lighten up ! I can 't lighten up . I hate my life ! We spend every day devising more ingenious ways of wasting time . I 'm sick of it . I 'm sick of table golf . I 'm sick of tiddlywinks show jumping . I 'm sick of stretching a pair of tights across the room to play Durex volleyball . If you like , we 'll kick the golf in the head , OK ? How about a game of Junior Angler ? All the thrills of freshwater fly-fishing from the comfort of your living room . No . Got it . Unicycle Polo . We could have a quick chukka on floor 14 . It 's smeggin ' stupid . Two grown men on unicycles , belting a beach ball up and down a corridor with French loaves ? ! It 's pathetic . It 's idiotic . It 's ... It 's ... It 's puerile . - Well , you invented it . - I want a life . This is worse than prison . In prison , you can look forward to getting out . I want to live . I want to meet people . I want to meet girls . I want to make love . Well , Junior Angler is the best you 're gonna get out of me , buddy ! Just get out of my face . OK . OK . But don 't ask me when you want someone to play soapsud slalom down the cargo ramp . You can carry your own damn flags . Lovely service , Lister . You should have come . Most uplifting . What 's wrong with you ? Ah ! It 's November . Nearly time for your bath . Please , just spare me the good mood , OK ? - What happened ? - I 'm sick of it , that 's what . I 'm just totally , totally sick of it . - Sick of what ? - Sick of you and your green suits . Sick of your stupid flared nostrils . Sick of how you smile when you 're being insulted . I 'm sick of the Cat , sick of Holly , sick of you , sick of me , and as for Kryten ... I 'm sick of him . I 'm sick of this ship , sick of this life . I 'm just sick of it . You 're unhappy , aren 't you ? Joining the Space Corps , that 's when it all went wrong . If I hadn 't , things could have worked out for me . That 's a tension sheet , isn 't it ? I went to school with the guy who invented those . Things certainly worked out for him , all right . A millionaire at 26 . Fred Holden . He was in our dorm . God , he was thick . " Thickie " Holden , we called him . " Hello , Thickie . How 's your acne ? " He always came bottom in geography . He thought a glacier was a bloke who fixed windows . He did invent the tension sheet . It 's just the stuff they used for packing . All he did was paint it red . And you know who he married ? Sabrina Mulholland-JJones . - The model ? - How can that be ? The most desirable woman in the world and Thickie Holden , a spotty gimp who 'd blow off the bedcovers whenever we had cauliflower cheese . - He had a break . He got lucky . - I suppose so . - Did you know anyone famous ? - Charles Keenan . He was famous . - What did he do ? - Ate his wife . Sorry to interrupt , but I think you should come to the photo lab . Something quite strange is happening . - These are ordinary photographs ? - What did you do ? I just developed the film , and they came to life . It 's the developing fluid . It must have mutated . At first , I thought it was just my film , but it works on any negative . There 's others I 've developed as slides . - Go for it . - Lights ! That 's Frank ! It 's my brother 's wedding ! - Yo ! I 'm in the photograph ! - Excuse me . Stand aside , please . - I 'm actually IN the photograph ! - You 're blocking the shot . I 'm actually at a smegging ' wedding ! - Are you trying to make trouble ? - Wow ! I 'm back on Earth ! - I 'm in a photograph ! - Look , will you clear off ? - Look ! He can touch me ! - Hop it . He can punch me ! This is brilliant ! He 's punching me again . Fantastic . All right ! All right ! OK . I 'm going . I can 't walk out of the edge . In-smeggin ' ... - .. credible . - Try another one . - What 's this ? - It 's one of Lister 's . I don 't recognise this . - Who are they ? - I don 't know . Oh , I remember . I sent away some snaps of me 18th birthday and got someone 's skiing holiday back . - It 's amazing . We 're really here . - I know . Check this . It even works in black and white . I tried a really old one , too . That 's Adolf Hitler , leader of the runners-up in World War II . I copied it from one of your magazines - " Fascist Dictator Monthly " . He was Mr October . Ignore him . He 's a complete and total nutter . And he 's only got one testicle . What 's he doing ? ! He 's scuffling with Adolf Hitler ! You can 't just stick one on the leader of the Third Reich . I nicked his briefcase ! Banana and crisps ? - His diary ! - Allow me . I 'll switch to translation mode . " Things to remember - stop milk , pay papers , invade Czechoslovakia . " A present here . " To Adolf . Love , Staff Colonel Count von Stauffenberg . " That rings a bell . Von Stauffenberg ... He 's famous for something . Wait a minute , he tried to assassinate Hitler by putting a bomb in his briefcase . How could I forget that ? Yes ! We 've got ourselves a smegging ' time machine . - So we can go absolutely anywhere ? - Providing we have a photograph . So if I had a photograph of a female-only naturist beach in Acapulco , full of bronzed , naked teenage temptresses , we could go for a holiday ? - I suppose . - Kryten , get my photo album . Hang on . We can 't move outside the confines of the photograph . - What we see is all we get . - Meaning ? We can 't just get a picture of Earth . We 'd stay inside the photograph . This beach shot in Acapulco , you wouldn 't want to leave the photograph . - So it 's useless , then ? - No , not entirely . Think of the famous places we could go . We could go to Dallas in November 1963 , stand on the grassy knoll and shout , " Duck ! " I 'm sorry , I must have bypassed my good-taste chip . The possibilities are enormous , mind-numbing . We could go back and avert major disasters . Like persuade Dustin Hoffman not to make " Ishtar " ? What about determinism ? Causality ? You can 't just mess about with history . - We 'll just do something small . - No such thing when you change time . - Only so we don 't get marooned in space . - Such as ? If I fix it so I don 't sign up with Red Dwarf , I can create an alternate existence on Earth . I won 't be stuck here for three million years . - How can you do that ? - With this ... and this . It 's ready . What is this ? Who is that jerk ? - It 's me . - You ? ! Aged 17 . That 's me first band , Smeg and the Heads . - What are you wearing ? - It was all the rage . " Sham glam " . Look at that collar ! You could go hang-gliding . I used to think it was so cool . Come on . This is one of the first songs I ever wrote . It was called " Om " . Nothing like a good old-fashioned love song , eh ? I genuinely thought we were gonna be massive . God , I was stupid . - Who are the other two ? - The hippy drummer 's called Dobbin . He joined the police . Became a grand wizard in the Freemasons . The bassist 's called Gazza . He was a neo-Marxist nihilistic anarchist . He joined a large insurance company and got a parking space . Wooh ! Yeah ! Rock and roll ! Thank you very much . For those who are interested , there are official T-shirts and signed Polaroids on sale in the back of Dobbin 's car . It 's the orange Ford with the bald tyres and no windscreen . We 'll be back in 20 minutes , so from me , Smeg , and from Dobbin and Gazza , the Heads , I 'll see you later . I 'll catch you guys later . - What is this place ? - It 's a pub . " Pub " . Ah , yes . A meeting place where people attempt to achieve advanced states of mental incompetence by the repeated consumption of fermented vegetable drinks . Guys , guys . I 'd like you to meet me , aged 17 . Sha-dy ! This is totally shady . It 's beyond shady , it 's surreal . - These your mates , then ? - Yeah . That 's Cat , Kryten , and ... Rimmer . Brilliant tattoo ! What 's it stand for ? Heavy metal ? - Yes , indeed . - And what 's happened to his face ? ! It 's grotesque , isn 't it ? Has he had an accident ? He looks like he had his head jammed in a lift . It 's totally shady ! Just sit down and shut up . - So , what do you want ? - I 've come to change our future . Aren 't you happy being a rock star ? Those groupies getting you down ? - We don 't make it as a rock star . - That 's impossible . It cannot be . How can I put this ? You don 't make it ' cause ... you 're crap . How would you know , grandad ? You 're too old for what we transmit . - I 'm you , you dork ! - Too old and too crypto-fascist . Will you shut up ? I 'm trying to make you rich . Just go down to the patent office and register this as your invention . - It 's called a tension sheet . - Uh-uh . That 's immoral . - That 's Thickie Holden 's invention . - Uh-uh . Was . This is just packing stuff , painted red with writing on it . - I know . - It 's crypto-fascist bourgeois crap . It 'll make you a multi-multi-multi-millionaire . But I 'm not into dosh . I loathe possessions . It 's just so ... so crypto-fascist . Stop saying everything 's crypto-fascist ! You make me sound like a complete git ! I 'm not breaking up the band . Music is me life . He 's right . He can 't give up his music . You heard " Om " . It 's a masterpiece ! - See ? - Back off . I 'm giving you a break . Oh , give up . The guy 's an idiot . - He 's me ! - Exactly . I don 't want a break . I 'll take me own chances . If you do , you 'll be stuck on a spaceship with them for the rest of eternity . You won 't have a future . You think about it . C 'mon . You haven 't got a copy of " Om " , have you ? - They 're in the car . - What a pity . I just can 't get it out of my head . Om ... Keep writing those hits , kid . What a nice guy ! What now ? Once the timelines sort themselves out , we 'll see if it 's worked . It 's happening ! I 'm disappearing ! - What happened ? - Lister altered the timelines and lived an entirely different life . He didn 't join Red Dwarf , so the Cat race never existed and we never rescued Kryten , so they 've disappeared , too . - So it 's just you and me ? - For eternity . No , thanks ! Find him and bring him back . - Anything ? - Got him . - And ? - Tension sheet . Inventor , D Lister , 17 . - Damn ! - He died in a plane crash , aged 98 . - 98 ? ! - His own fault , apparently . He was making love to his 14th wife and lost control of the plane . - Have you got any photographs ? - Not of that , no . No , so I can bring him back . There 's one picture reference , but you won 't like it . - Heeeeeere 's Blaize - Hello . Welcome to " Lifestyles of the Disgustingly Rich and Famous . " Tonight , we look at the world 's youngest billionaire , Dave " Tension Sheet " Lister . Behind me , Mr Lister 's English mansion . He had the whole building transported brick by brick from down the road , just to get away from the neighbours . Now that 's the kind of cash that opens anybody 's legs . The gravel in his drive came from Buckingham Palace . Dave bought Buck Palace and had it ground down just to line his drive . This man has a wad so thick , you could use it to beat whales to death . He calls his home " Xanadu " , not in reference to " Citizen Kane " , but as tribute to the hit single by Dave Dee , Dozy , Beaky , Mick Tich . But Dave has musical aspirations of his own . Only last year , his first single , " Om " , shot to Number One when he personally purchased three million copies . You 'll never be short of an ashtray in his house . Like many people who have everything , Dave 's life has been tinged with tragedy . Well , actually , it hasn 't , but we can only hope . Now Dr Bob Porkman , father of the condom that calls you back ... Freeze . I 've seen enough . - What do you want to do ? - I 'm going in . - I 'm going in to rescue him . - Rescue him ? It 's my duty . My duty as a complete and utter bastard . Yow ! Mr Lister , sir . What a delight it is to welcome you home . Gilbert , my man ! You 're looking bad , baby ! - Indeed , sir . - You 're my main , main , main , main man ! I am awfully sorry about the statue , sir . The contractors still haven 't devised a way of making it urinate champagne into the courtyard , although I am assured that it will be functional for the royal visit . Oh , get outta town ! This is gonna slay ' em . Indeed , sir . I am only just recovering from the hilarity of the gag myself . Almost Swiftian in its rapier-like subtlety . I told Daddy today . About us , I mean . - How did the old codger take it ? - Not terribly well , actually . He perched on top of his clay pigeon launcher and shouted , " Pull ! " For madam , Lobster a la Grecque . For sir , a sausage and onion gravy sandwich on white bread with a glass of sterilised milk . Brilliant . We lived on these when I was in the band . As requested , sir , it was helicoptered in from Luigi 's Fish ' n ' Chip Emporium . An artist beyond comparison , sir . Excuse me , sir , but a gentleman appears to have appeared in the room . Listy , it 's me . It 's me , Rimmer . Rimmsy . Arnie Rimmer . Arnie . Old Iron Balls . Rimmer . Rimmer ! Apparently , the gentleman 's name is Rimmer , sir . - Have we met ? - Have we met ? We 're like brothers . We were shipmates . Red Dwarf . - You don 't remember , do you ? - Remember what ? Of course . It hasn 't happened , has it ? - What hasn 't happened ? - Sabrina Mulholland-JJones ! - Yes ? - THE Sabrina Mulholland-JJones ? Model , best-selling novelist and international jet-setter ? Yeah . She 's me bird . " She 's me bird . " You call the Duke of Lincoln 's eldest daughter " me bird " ? Gilbert , escort Mr Rumour to the door ? - But I came here to save you . - Throw him out , Gilbert . He 's a nutter . - Step this way , sir . - But we were friends , buddies ! Let 's not have a scene , sir . You call this happiness ? Surrounded by toadying lackeys and paid sycophants ? Living with a love goddess sex-bomb ? You call this contentment ? You know , I look at the two of us and I ask one simple question ... Who is the rich man ? You , with your 58 houses , your private island in the Bahamas , your multi-billion-pound business empire , or me with ... with ... with what I 've got . It 's you , isn 't it ? Yes , it 's all clear to me now . You ... richer and happier . This way , sir . I should have thought a bit harder about that speech . I cocked it up a bit . - Any luck ? - Useless . Didn 't listen . Didn 't even recognise me . He just thought I was some deranged madman . You sure he didn 't recognise you ? Wait a tension-popping minute . If Lister can do it , why can 't I ? These photographs , there 's one here of me at boarding school , aged eight . I can invent the tension sheet first . But you 'll disappear and become incredibly wealthy , and Lister will be sent hurtling back . Yes , and Cat and Kryten will be brought back into existence . True , as a by-product , I 'll become mega-rich and be forced to have constant sex with that JJones woman , but that 's a sacrifice I 'm prepared to make . Holly , torch . - Pssst ! Wake up . - What is it ? - Who are you ? - Look , don 't be afraid . I 'm going to make you rich . All you 've got to do is listen very , very carefully . Right , this is the plan . You will invent a thing called the tension sheet . - Pension sheet ? - T. T. Tension . Tension sheet . Shut up . I 'm talking . Are you listening ? They 're sheets of paper with air bubbles in them . - Like you get in packing paper ? - Look , Holden , go back to sleep . They 're exactly the same as the ones in packing paper , but you paint them red . - Why red ? - Because it helps people relax . Shut up . I 'm trying to make him rich . You 'd write better if you took off your boxing gloves . - Now , have you got all that ? - I think so . First thing tomorrow , take the idea to the patent office . I can 't . Not first thing . I 've got extra rugby practice because I 'm so wet . All right , lunchtime . Take it at lunchtime , OK ? I 've got to go now . Oi . Don 't mess this up . No , sir . Oh , yes ! Oh , yes ! Oh , yes ! - Worked , did it ? - Though it pains me dearly , I 'll be having to say ta-ta to your gormless face . Ta-ta , poverty . Ta-ta , failure . Hello , Sabrina . Hello , sexual ecstasy . A-ha . Here they come , bang on time . Well , gentlemen , just enough time for me to say toodly-pipski . - I 'll disappear any moment now . - What happened ? Here it comes ... Any moment . What 's he talking about ? Any moment ... Any moment now . It hasn 't worked . According to our data , you didn 't invent the tension sheet . It was invented by a gentleman named " Thickie " Holden . - What ? - You 've put things back as they were . Why does nothing ever go right for me ? Every time I get so much as a snifter of a break , a glimpse of happiness , something inexplicably cruel and horrible happens , - and it blows up in my face . - Hang on . Something is different . Somehow , you 're no longer a hologram . - You 're alive . - What ? I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Mmmm ! I 'm alive ! Kryten , unpack Rachel and get out the puncture repair kit . I 'm alive ! I 'm alive . I can touch , I can feel , I can fondle . I 'm alive ! Don 't you think it 's incredible ? I am ali ... What was he saying ?

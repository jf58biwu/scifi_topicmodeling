[ chuckles ] Yeah . [ engine rumbling ] Are you sure Sunny 's gonna pick us up ? No , we like standing around here looking at empty busses . He should be here . I 'll give him a call . It 'd be nice if we picked up some flowers for Mrs. Kent . Oh , yeah , I don 't see any flowers . I meant the florist over there . - Uh-oh . - What ? What is it ? It 's my bag with all my comedy routines . I must 've left it on the bus . I 've heard them . Nobody 's gonna take them . At least nobody with a brain . Lana , I 'll make the jokes . Okay .

Willie 's gonna lend me his station wagon . Ma 's cookin ' up a big feast . So let 's go put the feed bag on , uh ? Oh , yeah , I can almost smell the turkey . She has turkey on my first day back . [ chuckles ] [ dramatic music ] [ reminiscing Korean war screams ] Just need it for one week , uh ? Well , that 's the strangest deal I ever made . It 's all I want it for . Darn thing 's been deserted for 15 years then a man comes and offers me a thousand dollars for one week . I would have rented it to for six months for that kinda money . You don 't mind my asking ' , what do you need it for ? I mind . [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ sighs ] Everything was so delicious . Oh , thank you , Lana . No , TJ and I can take care of these . - We will ? - That 's the least we can do . Yes , the least . Martha , no one can put a Turkey together like you can . That 's the second time you 've said that since dessert . And , I 'm gonna keep on saying that until you stop all this unnecessary worrying ' . What worrying ' ? Apparently , we got a call from this X army buddy of mine . All of a sudden you 're mom 's building a case about it . Well , why wouldn 't he tell me his name ? Now , who knows ? I don 't like the way he sounded and don 't you tell me it was because we had a bad connection . There was hate in his voice . Now , Martha .. [ glass shattering ] I better get in there before we run out of dishes . And , don 't you , " Now Martha " me . [ mumbling ] I don 't know , Pa . She 's got pretty good instincts . Well , she does that . But , it was just an army friend of mine who was passing through town , that 's all . Your ma chased us out of the kitchen . But , with a smile . What are you kids gonna do this afternoon ? I have to get our house ready . My mom 's comin in tomorrow mornin ' . Can you give her a ride TJ ? I can hang out . No , Clark .. ... why don 't you guys take the pick-up and go in into town ? Don 't let your mother start a worry epidemic around here . You know how she frets over me ? You go have a good time . When you 're in town , check on the carburator . Will do . [ sighs ] [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ telephone ringing ] Hello . Ms. Kent .. ... this is Dr. Williams calling from the emergency room of Smallville County Hospital . I 'm afraid you 're son 's been in an accident . An accident ? He is askin ' for his father . What kind of an accident ? Automobile . Oh , that tractor of mine . First it was the jeep and now it 's the tractor . Must be something in the air . That was a call for the emergency room of the Smallville hospital . There 's been a car accident . Oh , Ma , there 's nothing to worry about . We know that nothing can happen to Clark . He said that Clark was asking for you . Lana or TJ must be hurt . You stay by the phone . I 'll go to the hospital . [ siren blaring ] ( male # 1 ) Jonathan . [ dramatic music ] Jonathan over here . [ music continues ] It 's been a long time , Jonathan . [ music continues ] [ siren blaring ] [ tires screeching ] [ blaring continues ] [ car honking ] [ sighs ] Thank heavens you 're alright . - Of course we 're alright . - I was worried sick about you . Why would you be worried sick , ma ? Someone called and said there was an accident . There wasn 't any accident . There were three guys at town but that was this morning and that was no accident , that was deliberate , huh . Now , that is the second odd call . He said , he was a Dr. Williams and that you were askin ' for Pa . - Where is pa now ? - He went to the hospital . Will you guys stay with her I 'm gonna run to the hospital . Why don 't you take Tj ? I 'll take care of your mom . I 'm okay . I 'll be right back . [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] You left me to die , Jonathan . Pay off is long overdue . You know they tortured me ? They cut me . They burned me . Week after week , months after months . The only thing that kept me alive was thinkin ' about you . [ theme music ] No , Superboy , there 's no Dr. Williams on the roster . But , he did call from here though . It wasn 't me , and I have been on the desk all afternoon . Superboy ? You 're breaking into a conversation , Ted . - It 's okay , nice to meet you . - Yeah . Okay , what is it Ted ? Uh , I think someone stole my ambulance . May be you just misplaced it . Try lookin ' in the lost and found . Very funny , no chance I misplaced it . I went inside to do my paperwork .. ... and when I came out .. ... it was gone . Well , don 't drag your feet . Report it to transportation . Who would be dumb enough to steal an ambulance , anyway . [ dramatic music ] Tom , what the hell is the matter with you ? Now , you better listen to me- - No ! Shut up . You listen to me . You recognize me , ha ? Even with this-this thing covering the scars on my face . Of course , I recognize you . Why did you do it , Jonathan ? Why did you leave me out there ? I didn 't abandon you . We searched all over for you . You disappeared . We lost town men . We were ordered back to the base . We still couldn 't find you . Not good enough , Jonathan . Not after all I have been through . What are you going to do ? They didn 't tell me so I am not gonna tell you . [ intense music ] Yes , Jonathan . Look at that . What 's that ? That 's what the North Koreans made me wear as prisoner of war . I 've been saving it so I can throw it in your face . I 've got something appropriate for you , too . - Looks familiar Jonathan ? - Don 't be crazy , Tom . - It wasn 't my fault . - Yes , it was your fault . Now , put that on . No ! [ bullets ricocheting ] Put in on . [ theme music ] For god sakes , Tom . Don 't do this . I 've waited too long for this moment , I can 't stop now . You get that uniform dirty captain , crawl ! Go on , crawl ! Crawl , Jonathan , crawl . Crawl for your life . Go on crawl , Jonathan . Get down on that dirt . [ bullets ricocheting ] Gettin ' tired , Jonathan ? So was I. [ explosion ] [ theme music ] [ bullets ricocheting ] ( Tom ) Your luck 's holding out , Jonathan . But , for how long , huh ? [ bullets ricocheting ] Hey , Jonathan , now I 've got ya . ( Jonathan ) Go ahead , Tom . Go ahead , kill me . That 's what I said , Jonathan . But , they wouldn 't do it . I begged them to do it . No , they kept shooting poison arrows at me just missing me , trying to drive me crazy . ( Tom ) They all missed , except one . One , hit me in the face . And that 's why I want your face now , Jonathan To scar it like mine , to do to you , what you did to me . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] - You okay ? - Now I am . Wait . Wait , wait . [ eerie music ] [ explosions ] I don 't wanna kill you . Just him . Once the killing starts , it gets out of control . Let me handle this . Tom , it 's me your friend , Captain Gin . [ dramatic music ] The North Koreans , they are the enemies , not me . Captain Gin , get down . They 're all around us . We gonna tackle in circle . Here they come . They are comin after us .. Oh , hell . - That 's okay , that 's okay . - No .. You can stop shooting . You can stop shooting . The war is over . It 's been over a long time . It 's over ? Yeah , it 's over . Did we win ? War makes losers of all of us . [ dramatic music ] Specially me . Jonathan .. ... Jonathan , look what they did to me , look . Look , look ! [ dramatic music continues ] There 's no scar . Of course , there is . Can 't you see it ? It 's an inner scar . We can 't see it , but it 's there . A lot deeper . The pain won 't go away . Tom , it 's gonna work out . Yeah , I promise you it 's all gonna work out . Come on , now . Come on . [ reminiscing Korean war screams ] I am sorry , Jonathan . I am sorry . I wont be able to spend the rest of the day with you . - It 's no problem . - I wanna thank you . For showing ' up when you did yesterday . It 's the least I can do , Pa . Martha , I 'll see you tomorrow at noon . Oh . - You be careful - Oh , yes , I will . [ engine starts ] I 've always prided myself on being a compassionate person but , I don 't see why your father has to drive him back to the sanitarium . That man has lived a nightmare all these years . Living in the terrors of the prison camp . I guess pa feels they were there for each other in Korea . He wants to be there for him now . I know but , I just can 't get it out of my mind that he almost killed your father . Ah , I know you 're right . Oh , I just need some time . [ glass shatters ] Oh , my goodness . Oh , my .. Clark , I think your mother will be very lucky to invite us over again . None the less , we 'll bring our dishes . [ chuckles ] [ dramatic music ] Captioned by Grant Brown

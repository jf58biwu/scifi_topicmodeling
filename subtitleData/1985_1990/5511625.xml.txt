 Good evening , I am Howard K. Smith and this is the state of the War tonight . In the boot of Italy near Rome , a battle is raging ... with Resistance fighters dug in all along the Appian Way . Closer to home , our own freedom fighters yesterday attacked and obliterated ... an important supply depot ... of the Alien Central State 's Army on the plains of Oklahoma . Meanwhile , the standoff continues on the Mongolian rim in Arizona ... where the Rann Bishop commandos ... are hemmed against the sheer cliffs of the Grand Canyon , fighting for their lives . On the brighter side , the Freedom Network has awarded ... this week 's Medal of Valour to Dixie Reilly ... a high school science teacher ... who used his home computer to patch into the top secret Alien Security System . The information he was able to provide the local Resistance ... prevented a surprise attack on Memphis . And that 's where we stand tonight . From the Freedom Network in New York , our hopes are with you . Good night . We shouldn 't be acting on our own . We need backup . There wasn 't time . We got word that Diana 's moving the converter to Legation . How can you be sure this is the convoy ? Willie intercepted the radio message . What if this converter is too big to haul out of here ? We not gonna haul it , we 're gonna trash it . This is a lot of hardware for a trashing . We 're going to need it . I told you we needed backup . It is too late now . We gotta go forward . You take the back jeep . Go . Come on . Move it . Notify Diana we 're taking them to the Mother Ship . They did what ? Why 'd you let Ham do it ? Couldn 't you wait ? There wasn 't time . We got word from Indio they were slipping the converter through tonight . And you didn 't try to stop him ? Have you ever tried to stop a runaway train ? I mean , that 's why I called you . - I want to know if they 'll kill them . - No way . They hit the jackpot with Kyle and Ham . Those weren 't just prisoners , those were instant promotions . Any luck monitoring the Visitor Legation ? Not much . It sounds as if they might have taken Kyle and Mr. Ham to the Mother Ship . Exchange me for them . Absolutely not . Diana won 't hurt me . - She wants me alive , not dead . - Forget it , Elizabeth . It 's the only way . No , sweetheart . We 'll think of another way . Diana gets you , we 'll never get you back . Let 's start looking . The only way we 're going to get them back is if we make our own breaks . Just couldn 't stay away , could you , Mr. Tyler ? Yeah , I 'm nuts about you . I 'm going to have to discourage that . I was going to eliminate you quickly . I think I 'll do it slowly instead . What , throw away a winning hand ? I don 't play games . Incinerate the tough one . We 'll dine on the tender . Ship approaching . Identify . - Prospero . - That 's Charles ' ship . Don 't go by reputation ... that 's undoubtedly exaggerated and self-promoted . In his case ... I 'm not interested in lists of conquests . I am interested in what he 's doing here . Why would the Leader send his Special Envoy ? A promotion for you . An award , perhaps . Yes . That must be it . Tell the Prospero I 'm onboard and will meet the shuttle . Attention , docking crew , gate 7 . Prepare to offload the incoming command shuttle prop . I wish that I had been given more warning . Time for a fitting welcome . Perhaps a dinner . I 've come to conquer , not to dine . The Leader 's become very impatient with our lack of progress in the war . Yes , the loss of Lydia . Oh , yes . It was a terrible tragedy . I conducted an investigation myself . - Really ? - Yes . And what did you discover , Diana , dear ? Obviously a plot by the Fifth Column . - How did ... - I must be psychic . I had a feeling there might be an accident . I sent a drone in my place . I took another shuttle . What a relief . I 'll be preparing your quarters . Would you be staying long ? - As long as it takes . - Takes for what ? To win the war . I don 't understand . You 're assuming my command ? It isn 't necessary that you understand . The Leader was disappointed with the report he received from Lydia ... on your record here . Thus , I 'm taking over your command . And I have been made Charles ' adjutant . - No doubt a reward for your loyalty . - No doubt . I 've been monitoring your activities here . Some of your prisoners will be of value to me . Yes , you snagged a fair bit of game , didn 't you , Diana ? Some work while others intrigue . Not only a fair bit of game has been snagged ... but you 've provided me with the very animal I was looking for . I have plans for our Mr. Tyler . He 's dangerous . - He should be eliminated . - All in good time . But first I 'm going to convert him . The conversion process is not foolproof . I 've had disappointing results . I know . Charles has developed an improved method . We 've brought it with us on a microchip . Fascinating . I 've moved the conversion chamber to the Legation . Why don 't you give me the microchip and I 'll see that it 's installed . That 's quite all right . I 'm sure Lydia can manage . I see . And what is my function to be ? You will remain as Chief Science Officer . Naturally , you will clear everything through me . And Lydia ? You may consult with her , if I 'm not available . Go to the Legation . I want the converter operable as soon as possible . Ladies . Prepare a shuttle . I 'll be going to the Legation immediately . Send a transmission to the Legation . Tell them that Lydia is arriving by shuttle ... and is to be met at the landing pad . Excuse me , Diana . But security reports that all transmissions ... to and from the Legation is being monitored . The Resistance ? Shall I send a courier instead ? No . Leave it to me . Put me through to Legation . I want to make sure that Lydia has a reception befitting an adjutant . Lydia ' s shuttle will be arriving at the landing pad at 1400 hours . As Charles 's adjutant , she deserves VIP treatment . What 's up ? Can we use this ? This is it . Thanks for the use of the limo . What 's that ? Too tight ? Sorry , one size fits all . See that the cargo boxes containing the microchip ... and the spare parts for the converter are unloaded and brought to Legation at once . Welcome to LA . How many times are you going to ask the same questions ? I 'm sorry . Let me ask you this . What do you suppose this guy Charles is doing right about now ? Tearing the city apart looking for me . I hear he 's hardly got enough time for that , the way Diana 's keeping him occupied . That 's a lie . How would you know that ? The same way we knew when you were arriving . That snake . We hear that at this very instant she is having Ham Tyler interrogated ... on the Mother Ship . She can 't do anything without reporting to me . I 'm Charles ' adjutant . Tyler can 't be transferred from the Legation ... without authorization from either me or ... Thanks . We didn 't know where he was . You 've made a serious error in kidnapping me . Can it . - Did you get all that ? - Sure did . We better get word to Elias before they try to move Ham . Right . We may get our hands on Kyle as well . Since you took such pains to see the conversion chamber , Mr. Tyler ... I 'm delighted to introduce you to it . Take him to 200 cycles . In order to defeat your enemy ... you must know how to make him vulnerable . First , we erode Mr. Tyler 's will ... then we program him to act on a trigger phrase . Well , then , what does he like ? Who does he love ? He loved a woman and their daughter . He married her in Cambodia . She 's missing . He is still trying to find her . Who does he hate ? You , for a start . But let 's pick someone close to him , not an enemy . Why not Mr. Donovan ? Begin dream sequence . Sequence has begun . Now to create the conflict . I 'm not here . I 'm definitely not here . What do you think ? Wave to Daddy . You give him a nice wave , and you get over here . What are you doing here , Donovan ? Good stuff . No , Donovan ! That 's my wife ! That 's my daughter . That 's my family , Donovan . That 's very interesting . What do you plan to do with Mr. Tyler when you 're finished ? Place him back inside the Resistance . By the time I 'm finished , Ham Tyler will kill Mike Donovan ... on live television for the entire country to see . And the Resistance will be no more . Turn it up to 500 cycles per second . Dream , Mr. Tyler . Dream deeply . Punch in conveyor , Ham 's wife and children . You 're on final cycle . He could break at 650 . Terminate at 640 . Punch in Donovan . Donovan , what are you doing here ? Just pushing the food along . There 's my son now . Kill Donovan . Take a look behind you , Ham . Shut the machine off . Can 't do it . Got a deadline . Look . Your wife ... your daughter ... There 's my son now . Kill Donovan . This is not my family . Donovan , help me ! No . Take a look down there . Go ahead . Pick up the gun . Kill me . I 'm definitely not here . They 're at 644 cycles . Good . Now watch . Bring it down to zero . There 's a good fellow . Tell me ... what 're you going to do for me now . There 's my son now . Kill Donovan . You see , Diana ... the sound cocks the pistol . The phrase fires it . Now , what 's this fairy tale about ? Tyler killing Donovan . Fairy tales don 't interest me . Making history does . Which is what I 'm offering you . Ham Tyler assassinating Mike Donovan on television . Done under the guise of a prisoner exchange arranged by you . Your security will then necessarily terminate the assassin . That 's very ambitious . But even if you could get Tyler to kill his friend ... Donovan would never agree to a prisoner exchange arranged by me . We 're mortal enemies . He 'd suspect a trap . Not if it 's your son being exchanged . - What ? - He was captured with Ham Tyler . Caught in the act of sabotage . Those are grounds for execution . But I decided to spare him . He will be exchanged for Lydia , who has just been kidnapped . Mr. Chiang , you check on the whereabouts of my son . Yes , Mr. Bates . Obviously I 'd like to discredit the Resistance . And I 'd like to see Donovan and Tyler dead . But I need proof . I appreciate a cautious man . A demonstration will be arranged . No harm must come to my son . That is entirely up to you . We can 't just leave them . We 've gotta get them out . We better surprise them , we don 't stand a chance . Come on . He 's right . A frontal attack on the Legation right now would be suicide and you know that . When Ham and I were in Nam , I got cut off . I never would 've made it if Ham hadn 't come in and gotten me out . So I 'm not going to leave him now . There must be something we can do . I know Kyle wouldn 't desert us if things were reversed . Honey , we 're not deserting him . But we can 't just risk everything without something definite to go on . Excuse , please . Charles , the Leader 's convoy has taken Ham to Science Frontiers . Envoy , Willie . I think Diana is being replaced . Perhaps . But the arrival of Charles does mean one thing : That the Leader intends to win . So do we . Any sign of Kyle ? No , but it 's got to be up , right ? If we hustle , we can catch Ham at Science Frontiers . Or in transit . He 's got a good point . Come on , Willie , we need you . Wait outside . Why don 't you relax , Kyle ? I can spare you the pain that Ham Tyler is suffering . Selling out 's my father 's game , not mine . That 's a shame . I find you very attractive . I 've learned much from your mating rituals . I hope you 've been comfortable in your gravity chair . But I found a few secret pleasures ... that you might find interesting . I 'll bet . You have no idea how appreciative I can be ... to those who cooperate . I think I prefer the chair . Keep him here till I get back . Don 't hurry on my account . Sit tight . Don 't get up . I 'll find my own way out . Gentlemen , I believe you two know each other . You 'll forgive me if I don 't rise to shake your hand . I wouldn 't take it . Same winning personality . Place the photograph over there . When I tell you to , read what 's on this card . Are you crazy ? Now read the card . " I don 't see him . " Wait . " There 's my son . " Timing is all . As you can see . You have a few seconds to move away from Donovan . The trigger phrase is underlined . - " There 's my ... " - I wouldn 't finish that sentence . Very impressive , Charles . I 'll set up the meeting right away . Free live rodents for our troopers in uniform . Step right up . Don 't be shy . Here you go . Enjoy . If only my mother could see me . Willie , you look cute . She was bit of a chameleon , old mom . - You mean a comedian . - No , chameleon . It 's in my blood . I hope this works . Are you kidding ? Live rodents , all you can eat . They can 't resist it . Heads up , they 're on their way . - Got you . - Let 's make it . Over here , guys . Stop . Free live rodents . All you can eat . Come one , they 're free . It will only take a minute . Good job , Willie . Come , Mr. Ham . Let 's go . Comb the ship and do it quietly . Find Kyle Bates and notify no one but me . When I move into my permanent quarters ... remind me to have a privacy circuit installed . Of course . I just thought you 'd like to know that the Resistance has liberated Ham Tyler . That is precisely the kind of incompetence that brought me here . Never mind . In fact , it will work even better this way . The Resistance will never suspect Ham Tyler now that they 've rescued him . - How 's Kyle Bates ? - Difficult . See that he 's brought to the master control room at 1800 hours . I 've arranged with Bates for a telecast ... that will let the Resistance know we 're ready to make the exchange . Is something the matter ? I was thinking about Lydia . She knows many secrets valuable to the rebels . She 's not a strong woman . I have found her ... amazingly vital . Our perceptions of her are very different . But mine 's the one that counts . I was worried . We couldn 't risk being followed . So we took the long way back . How you feeling ? I need a little time to myself . Where 's Kyle ? We didn 't see him . Last time I saw him was the Mother Ship . He 's probably there . We 'll get him back . Don 't worry . All right ? Never better . What 's wrong with you ? Nothing . He 's had a tough time . He just needs a little space . Everybody knows what you 're going through . Especially me . I went through it , remember ? And I know if I can get through it , you can get through it . I 'm fine . Look at this . They 're handing them out all over town . Bates is going on television to ask for help . Mike , what does it say ? They 've agreed to a live telecast of Kyle from the Mother Ship . They 're asking for a prisoner exchange . Kyle for Lydia . Bates to act as intermediary . I don 't trust Bates . He wouldn 't do anything to harm his son . Bates would do anything to get what he wants . On my furlough I 'm going to go sun on a rock somewhere . Now that sounds good , I think I 'll do the same . Hey , buddy , where you going ? I 'm going to go the Galápagos Islands . I hear they 're smog-free . Would you like a fresh rodent ? - No , thanks . - Come on , it 's the last one . Maybe just this once . Thank you . Are you sure you want it ? Looks awfully good . Didn 't anyone ever tell you not to play with your food ? I wonder what 's going on . That Diana , always up to something . We 're ready . Good evening . I am Charles , Special Envoy from our Leader . I come to you in good faith ... and with the hope that we can ... set aside some of the misconceptions that have divided our peoples . We are not your enemies . What is this ? An Oxford or a Cambridge list ? In the words of one of your famous presidents ... I 'm having déjà vu . ... " You have nothing to fear , but fear itself . " Tonight I wish to allay that fear . Kyle Bates , son of one of your important leaders ... was captured during an act of sabotage in which several of our people were killed . He was not harmed . Lydia , my adjutant was kidnapped by the Resistance . I have offered Kyle Bates ... in exchange for her safe return . He is here . He is well . I 'm sure he 'd like to speak to his father . Please feel free to say whatever you want . Free speech . Right . They haven 't given me a whole lot of time here ... so I just want to you to know that I 'm okay . Elizabeth ... if you 're watching , I want you to know ... that I love you . No matter what happens , nothing will ever change that . I love you , too , Kyle . This concludes our special broadcast from the Mother Ship . We will give you updates as they become available . This transmission will be rebroadcast later this evening . It 's obvious Bates is desperate . He 's willing to risk his own son 's life to get to us . We 're the only thing standing in Bates ' way of controlling the city . Diana 's in his way . Bates could live with that . It 's a trap , Mike . Not if we reset it . We agree to the prisoner exchange , but on our terms . Won 't they be waiting for us ? I have an idea . We wait until the very last minute before we announce the exact spot . I 'd say the abandoned sports arena at Riverhead . This guy Charles has rigged a worldwide television hookup . But they 'll only broadcast what they want seen . Right . But Deke Harris at KDHB is an friend of mine . I can get him to rig a hookup of our own . How 's Bates gonna violate a truce in front of 40 million people ? What do you say ? I say we go for it . How bad was it ? What did they do to you ? I don 't know . You must remember something . My wife . My daughter . Bits and pieces of things . What things ? I 'm not sure . Angry ? Killing angry ? Yes . Who ? They messed with my mind . You 've been through worse , Ham . Like Julie said , it didn 't work on her . You 're a hell of a lot tougher than she is . Maybe . Maybe not . I 've been expecting your call . The way the phones are tapped here ... I thought I 'd play it safe . I 've heard from the Resistance . Time and place of the exchange are set . Live TV coverage . You 'll notice they 're set up in anticipation of a trap . They could never anticipate Donovan being shot by one of his own . A sports arena . How quaint . They 've barely given us enough time to get there . I suggest you call Charles and tell him to get there with my son right away . Do I detect a note of concern ? I didn 't know you and Kyle were all that close . Let me tell you something , Diana ... they say that red blood 's thicker than green . Something happens to my son , I 'll spill a little of yours just to find out . I 'll see you later . We 'll use these tunnels to get out in case anything goes wrong . Ties into the main sewer line . At least we can get back . What if they try and trick us ? We 'll rig explosives just in case we need a diversion . The exchange will happen over here . What about the news people ? Won 't they be hurt ? It will just be a lot of noise , Willie . Nobody will get hurt . We got you covered . Let 's move out . Okay , everybody , let 's get moving . We need to plant these explosives to cover the escape . Resistance can be extremely unpredictable . That is both a strength and a weakness to be used to our advantage . I wonder if the people will believe it when Tyler kills Donovan . They 'll believe whatever we want them to . I want to take a moment with my son . Bring Mr. Bates his son . Thank you . Despite our obvious differences , I 've come to help you . - I didn 't ask for your help . - I know . But you might need it . If I need you , I 'll holler . Kyle , for once in your life , listen to me . There is not much time . Please don 't shut me out . There 's a lot of danger here . Anything could happen , go wrong . When it does , I want you to stay clear of it . You understand ? I 'll keep it in mind . I know I 've made a lot of mistakes . When this is over ... come see me . Maybe we can talk . Time is up . I want to remind you that you are here under a flag of truce . I expect everyone to act accordingly . Are the Visitors ready for the exchange ? We are . The Resistance ? - Where are you going ? - Keep him honest . We 're ready . I see you 've brought Lydia . All right , let 's proceed . No , where 's Kyle ? Where is he ? I don 't see him . Wait . There 's my son now . No ! Dad . Take off ! Let 's go . Move it . Remarkable . Tyler missed Donovan . But hit Bates . It could have been worse . They might have shot Lydia as well . Or you . English

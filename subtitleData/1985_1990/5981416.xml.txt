[ gunshot ] You 're next , Superboy . ( professor ) Oh . I tried to tell you , professor . It 's the way I am . The term is invulnerable . But if I don 't get some kind of sample we 'll never determine what you 're made of . Do you remember those meteor fragments , I had a while back ? The ones you threw into outer space ? How could I forget ? Every time I got near them , I felt like I was dying . Well , before we disposed off them , I managed to isolate some of the unique radiation that proved to be so so deadly to you . Hold it right there . [ machine humming ] This is going to hurt , isn 't it ? It might . [ electric humming ] [ intense music ] - Nothing . - Just wait . [ music continues ] - A-a-a-h ! - Ah , don 't move .

There aren 't any people like you , Superboy . Period . I think I 'll have a result for you by tomorrow . ( Superboy ) Thanks , professor . [ whooshing ] [ phone rings ] Professor Peterson . What ? Is there anything missing ? At last report , Lieutenant Williams was still in critical condition . The bullets removed from him were from Sergeant Johnson 's gun . Given the firepower of the high-tech weapons aboard the Swat van .. ... we must consider Johnson armed and extremely dangerous . I repeat , Johnson is armed and extremely dangerous . [ intense music ] [ phone ringing ] I 'm not here . ( Dean Lockhardt ) White ... T.J. White . Where are those contact sheets I asked for ? Get it together , kiddo . We 've got a paper to put to bed . You wanted me to get photos of that robbery down at the science laboratory . I 'd like to see them . Well , I don 't have ' em . Before I got started on that , you wanted a checklist of all the camera and dark room equipment . So , where are those contact sheets I asked for ? Get it together , kiddo . We 've got a paper to put to bed . I 'm doing the best I can , Dean Lockhardt . Do better . [ sighing ] Should have stayed with my first ambition , standup comedian . ( Dean Lockhardt ) Did you say something , T.J. White ? No , well , yeah , I mean , I just , I-I-I just said that I 'll get everything back on track as soon as Clark shows up . Clark ? Clark Kent ? Did you need to see me , Dean Lockhardt ? Mr. Kent , the alumni board has brought me into run The Shuster Herald as if that were a real newspaper . That means that we show up on time . I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . Editorially speaking , on the other hand . I was quite impressed with the work that the two of you turned out on the paper . Particularly your reporting , Clark . Thank you , ma 'am . Now , you two are due at the Agricultural Research Centre . I know that doesn 't sound like much of an assignment . But a good reporter will always come up with a good angle . So , get going . Just once , I wanna hear you come up with one of your one liners when it 's needed . Come on . [ intense music ] [ radio static ] I told you I can .. [ laughing ] [ ominous music ] Kent ! [ music continues ] Kent ! Clark Kent ? I know him , officer , but- - Where is ... where is Clark Kent ? Over there . His dorm 's over there . [ grunting ] [ coughing ] [ gasping ] You okay ? [ upbeat music on tape recorder ] Clark would have been here himself , Mr. Kent . But he 's on an assignment over at the Agricultural Centre . And he thought you might wanna meet him there . Oh , I 'd like that . That 'll give me a chance to look around . You know , they 're doing some interesting experimental work with that frost resistant grain . - Yeah ? - Yeah . How 's everyone in Smallville ? Well , everybody 's just fine and they and they all send their love . I hope , I can get back there soon . I hope you can , too . I 'm gonna go gas up the jeep . I 'll meet you in the parking lot in ten minutes ? - Okay . - Great . Bye . [ knock on the door ] [ dramatic music ] Yes ? [ intense music ] Clark Kent . I must find him . Where is he ? Is he in some sort of trouble , officer ? I must find him . Where is he ? Well , he 's not here . I 'll be seeing him in a little bit . Is there something you 'd like me to pass on ? I 'll pass it on personally . Where is he ? I don 't like the tone of your voice , mister . If you 've got a legal paper , I 'll co-operate . If not , then you back off ! Oh boy , city cops .

Oh .. ( Jonathan ) ' Oh , you look so good , don 't you ? ' Ah , I like that , beef man . God , nice to see you . - You must be J.T. ? - T.J. Oh , T.J. , I 'm sorry . It 's a real pleasure there , Mr. Kent . - Ah , T.J. - Just a minute , please . There 's Professor Peterson . How about us trying to charm him into upping our grades ? So Mr. Kent and company could be rid of us for a while ? You 're so quick , T.J. [ laughing ] Come on . Looks like college agrees with you , son . - How 's mom ? - She took a nasty fall . She didn 't break any bones or anything . But it sure slows her down quite a bit . She wouldn 't hear of me staying over . Now , she said I 've been looking forward to this trip too long . She 's not in any pain , is she ? The only pain is that she can 't be here with us . I miss her . I miss both of you . Hey , stop that kind of talk or I 'll start blubbering like a newborn calf . Pa , since when do newborn calves , blubber ? Well , I don 't ... something I just made up . That 's all . [ intense music ] [ gunshot ] [ crowd screaming ] [ intense music ] It 's a sniper !

Let me help . [ mellow music ] Professor . Feel you could stand up ? [ music continues ] Mr. Kent , Mr. Kent , where 's Clark ? I haven 't seen him since the shooting started . Not to worry , T.J. I saw him . He 'll be alright . [ ambient music ] [ intense music ] [ whooshing ] [ ominous music ] Glad to see you on your feet . A few questions ? I don 't want to delay getting him to my office to check him . You kidding ? Check out Superboy ? He was unconscious , lieutenant . Why take chances ? I 'm sure your questions can wait . [ ominous music ] Mr. Kent , do you think he 's gonna be alright ? Superboy can take care of himself . Why don 't you let me take care of you ?

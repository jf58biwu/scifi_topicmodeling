 Ugh . I hate that part . Bounty-hunters , have you completed your mission ? Oh , yeah , we wasted him . Check out the head on this sucker . Fine , however , an earlier expedition remains incomplete . A G-sweep of the planet Earth indicates residual crite life . - G-sweep 's wrong . - No way , Your Holiness ... I was there . I saw it all . The G-sweep is infallible . The Council is very nervous when it comes to the Crites . They are a lethal plague and must be wiped out . Pay for the hexapod kill shall be withheld until the eradication of Crites on Earth is verified . There must be no doubt . Does this mean we 're going back to Earth ? What takes you to Grover 's Bend , son ? My grandmother lives there . Oh , Easter vacation with Granny , huh ? Aw , that 's a good grandson . You know what the Bend 's famous for , don 't you ? What 's that ? Hasn 't your granny ever told you about those space porcupine things ? No , no , she never did . Bunch of folks hereabout think they came from one of those unidentified flying UFOs or some such . Some say those little boogers attacked one of the farms outside of town . Maybe a friend of your granny 's , huh ? The Browns ? No ... no , no , she doesn 't know any Browns . Come on , man ! Buried treasure right this way . What the hell are we doing ? Ain 't nobody lived here in two years . What exactly are we looking for ? Collector 's items . Nothing like ' em . Just like all the other weird shit you got in your store . Jeez , it 's freezing in here . What are they ? Whatever you tell people they are . So what do you say ? These things ain 't worth dick ! Okay , fine . I 'll just take ' em up to KC . See what one of them big antique stores will give me for ' em . - You do that . - But ... A case of Meister Bräu would save me a lot of trouble . - Load ' em up . - Right ! Perfect fit ! Come on , kids , let 's go . Hurry up . Hey , sis , dinner 's at 6 : 00 , okay ? Okay , Megan ! - You put ... - No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Okay , okay . We 'll pull the photo one column to the left . Now we 'll keep the " 4-H Club " sidebar , and we will swap the " Sidewalk Weeds Issue " with the " Easter Egg Hunt " right here ! Huh ? - L-l ... - Yeah . - Hey , Dad ! - Hi , honey ! - I got the returns . - Just put them back by the ... - the typeset , will you ? - Okay . So what do we do about the 39 lb . Squash ? We bury it somewhere on page four . I thought you said it was 29 lbs . 39 . I weighed OI ' Jumbo myself . Better move it up to page one . We 're still looking at empty space here . Put that back ! I got a stop-press story for you . Oh , what 's that ? " Bus Driver Finds Grover 's Bend " ? " Brad Brown Is Back in Town . " Bradley Brown ? ! The boy who cried " critter . " We don 't want to get scooped on this one , Mr. Morgan . Not much chance of that , Sal . We 're the only paper in 80 miles . This is big news in Grover 's Bend . Inquiring minds want to know ! - Like mine . - Mm-hmm . Just forget it , Sal . That boy 's stories nearly tore this town apart . Just let Grover 's Bend forget about that night . I mean it , Sal , no ... Brad Brown . Brad who ? Snack time ! Here we are ! Don 't you have any Clark Bars or Milk Duds ? Honey , fresh vegetables are high in fiber , and we need fiber for a healthy BM . We don 't want to get constipated , do we ? - No ! - No , we don 't . I know who that is ! Bradley , come on in . - Hi , Nana . - Oh , look at you ... You 're shooting up like a stinkweed . Mmm , you 've been eating red meat . No ! No , no , no . Not me . It 's the worst thing you could do to that body . Come in here and have a good snack with these kids . You know the carnivores have short intestines and the meat passes right out through ? But we 're herbivores , we 've got great long intestines and the meat just rots in there . No , no , you stop it . Quigley , get your stupid dog out of the way ! Chili Dog , get in the back ! Go on , get back . Go on ! Get in the back . Go on ! Get in the back , you miserable son of a bitch ! Go on ! - It 's just a dog . - So was Cujo . Shit . Hi , Harv . What in the hell are you doing here ? Important business . Brad Brown is back in town . Oh ... Well , on the important chart I 'd put that right between a pineapple quiche and a pimple on the ass . I thought you would want to talk with him ... you know , about the critters and all . Why in the hell would I want to do a thing like that ? If I never talk to anybody about them things that shall remain nameless , I 'll die a happy man ... and besides that , I ain 't been sheriff of this burg for two glorious years . Why don 't you run along home , Sal ? Because they 're about to start the bonus round . Here 's the last of them . Put them with the rest of them brain dead . So ... what about them brewskies ? This is all that plain-wrap piss . I thought we agreed on Meister Bräu . I ain 't got no Meister Bräu . Then I 'm taking two . And a couple of these ! I hate teenagers . Quigley ! Now ... what in the hell am I gonna do with you ? Right on the Highway 54 , just outside of Grover 's Bend .

Fat chance . Well , you better hurry , ladies . - Resurrections in 45 minutes . - Oh ! - Put this down on the other side . - Okay , Emily . Spread them out so they 're all even . Good morning , children . Happy Easter . We 're going to have to be patient today .

Boy , pretty good crowd today . I haven 't seen you since Christmas . - I thought he was gone ! - He 's trouble . Back here . - That 's him . Brad ! Welcome , friends . Welcome one and all . Today , of course , is the day of Resurrection . So it seems only fitting that some of you have chosen this day to resurrect your church-going habit . Why 'd I ever let her talk me into this ? Honey , that 's awfully beautiful . Aw , this is great . The Easter Bunny with his Tehachapi hanging out . It 'd give them kids a real education . What the hell was in you ? And entering into the sepulcher , they saw , sitting on the right side , a young man ... clothed in a long , white garment . And they were affrighted . Come on , sweetheart , let 's go . There you are . My dad just ran your grandma home . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm all right . What do you think happened to the sheriff ? You heard ' em . It was probably some kind of farm accident . Farm accident ? ! You saw him ! That was no farm accident . What are you trying to say ? You were telling the truth about those things , weren 't you ... - There 's no such thing as those things ! - I don 't believe you . I-I mean I do believe you . I mean , I believe what you said a couple years ago . Do me a favor and don 't do me any favors , okay ? Don 't you think we better go see Harv ? Well , I 'm going . Megan ... Harv ? ! We need you in town . Something awful 's happened at the church . What the hell are you doing here , boy ? We think it might have been those ... creatures . What creatures would that be ? - It 's true , Harv . - You see ' em ? - Not exactly , but I ... - Then don 't be bringing me grief ! You go tell the sheriff . - The sheriff is dead ! - They got him up at the church . His stomach was eaten out . Some of the folks are trying to say it was some kind of farm machine accident , but it wasn 't . You have to come with us , Harv ! What are you doing ? What does it look like I 'm doing , Einstein ? I 'm doing what any intelligent , God-fearing Grover 's Benders would do ! I 'm haulir ass ! You can 't leave now ! This town needs you ! Yeah ? This town voted me out in a landslide .

Yeah , and it could have been the brain from planet Eros . You saw him , Brad . It was no dog . Critters ! What 's the matter ? I need a little air . I was going home to take a hot bath and I see ... - Just slow down . - Rolling , rolling , towards me ... - It 's getting bigger and bigger ... - Take a breath !

Bounty-hunters ? ! - The space guys . - Oh . Oh , you mean the remote control . - It 's always on the TV . - Not the remote control . Nana , this is not the remote control . Those bounty-hunters ! That was fast . - More Crites . - Yeah , a lot more . Boy am I glad to see you ! B-both of you . These guys are great . Charlie ! Brad . I can 't believe it !

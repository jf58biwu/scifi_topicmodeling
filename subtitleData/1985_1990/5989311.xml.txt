You twisted , vicious- - you crippled super boy ! Yes , I can 't tell you how heartbroken I am about that . I never intended for him to live . How can you have so much hatred in you ? I don 't hate you . Haven 't you ever just cared about anyone ? Or were you born a monster ? Well , once a long time ago when I was a little boy , I found this puppy real sweet cuddly little guy . I loved that puppy . I truly did . So I broke his neck . I feel so sorry for you , Lex . No , my dear , it 's I who feels sorry for you . You 're going to pay for that . No . Superboy 'll pay for that . Superboy , can you hear me ? Professor Peterson . How do you feel ? Considering the circumstances , terrible . My powers are mostly gone .

And there 's nothing you can ever do to get her back ! No ! And the state police haven 't been able to find out anything either ? Well , they 've called in the FBI , and they 're following up every lead they can . We 've gotta find Lana . And we 've gotta get my powers back . What if we can 't do it ? What if I 'm like this for the rest of my life ? Hey , I 've never heard you like this . I 'm here to help you , I 'm here to help you find a way out of this . But if our therapy is to work , you 've got to pull yourself together . Hey ! I tell ya . The nurses told me . The doctor told me . Now I see it and I still don 't believe it . I 'm Wally Jones . I know who you are . I understand you 're going into rehab right away . Yeah . Eh , good choice . That 's what I did . You got a good doctor here , Superboy . You work hard , and you 're gonna do it . Looking at you gives me a lot more hope than I had five minutes ago . Okay . Just promise me one thing . Name it . When you 're flying again , take a spin for me . You got it . Superboy , one question , please . What do the doctors say about your condition ? Oh , Superboy ! Superboy , do you know of Lana LAN 's whereabouts ? Oh , how nice ! Your old boyfriend ! Is that a sad face I see on the Boy of Steel ? Aw , is him sad ? Would you just stop it , Lex ? Lana , I have a big surprise ! Darla , Lana . Lana , Darla . Darla 's our new friend . She 's going to be staying with us . She 's very sweet , very nice , very playful , very inventive . Maybe Darla can teach Lana some of our new little naughty games . Well , she 's just your type , Lex . I can just imagine what kind of games she plays . Hey , look ! You don 't know who you 're messing with here , chick ! Look , I 'm really not in a good mood . Ladies , ladies , ladies ! No , no , no , no , no , no . No , woman . No , woman .

Darling Darla , luscious Lana , and lovable Lex . A nice , happy family . Life is sweet . Well , I 'm afraid we 're gonna have to leave for a while , my dear . Darla and I have some business to attend to . Some fun business . This is a portable model of the superboy gun . I designed it myself before my untimely resignation at Eckworth Industries . It 's a surprise for Superboy . You think he 'll like it ? In five , four , three , two , one ! If you please ? Thank you . Good evening , and welcome to news break . The infamous Lex Luthor and his new bride , the former Lana Lang are enjoying a fabulous honeymoon . Seems the happy couple just can 't get enough of each other . Meanwhile superboy , that bastion of truth and justice is just twiddling his thumbs . We 're gonna send you a get well card ! Look at him , how he 's tormenting me like this ! Luthor 's on the rampage while I 'm sitting here useless ! You 're making progress . It 's not good enough . I 've gotta find out where he is and get to him . Wait a minute the tape . That 's it , the tape . What are you talking about ? The video tape Luthor made ! It was taken where he 's holding Lana . So ? If I had my full powers back , I could scrutinize the tape . There 's gotta be something in it that can help us . But your powers are still weakened . That 's why I 've gotta get them back . I wanna try the wood again . Try this . Heh , hey ! We 're getting something . To enjoy this moment of joy , and oh , we 're so sorry you can 't walk anymore . Wait a minute . Go back . Right there . Very well , hope you enjoy this moment of joy . It 's , it 's funny Lana 's eyes are blinking . Almost in rhythm . Like some kind of code . I can hardly see her eyes moving at all . It 's right there . She 's trying to tell us where she is in morse code . F-I-F-T-H ! Fifth and cypress ! That 's it ! Way to go , Lana ! A visitor at this hour ? Go see who it is . I 'm here for Lex Luthor . Superboy ! What a delightful surprise ! This is a citizen 's arrest , I 'm taking you in . A citizen 's arrest ? Well , well , well , look at you . Regular iron sides . I watch all the reruns . My , my , my , but you 're looking well , Superboy . You been copping some rays , have you ? You murdered Warren Eckworth , and then assumed his appearance . So I did . So I did . And Leo , your friend . Leo ? My friend . I have no friends . Never did . Never will . And if you 've harmed Lana , so help me , I 'll- - You 'll what ? I think you 've lost the use of your brain as well as your legs . What did you possibly hope to accomplish by coming here like this , you pathetic weakling ? You 're taking all the fun out of it ! Oh , well . I guess love does strange things . So it does . But I really came here to record your murder confession on tape . My confession ? That 's rich . That 's rich . Well , I certainly hope you enjoyed it because you 're the only one that 's ever gonna get to hear it . So long , Superboy ! You been a barrel of laughs . Oh , Lex . I was only ki- - I don 't believe this . Lex Luthor actually got his electrocution date pushed up . Andy , do you mind just changing the subject , okay ? It 's a difficult time for all of us , Lana . Sure is weird all right . I don 't feel very good at all . Do you have any last words ? Just my prayers . Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . Lex , this is really dangerous . What if it doesn 't work ? It 's got to work ! Thanks for the memories , Warden . I 've had a lovely time . My compliments to the chef . No , no , no , wait , wait , wait ! No please ! Please don 't do it yet ! Oh no please ! Please ! I don 't wanna die ! Oh , God , no ! No , please . Please , no ! No ! No ! No ! Gotcha ! I didn 't think it was gonna work . Oh , Lex ! Oh , you 're really hurt ! I hope I never have to do this again ! Don 't touch me . Don 't touch me . At least not until this wears off . How do you like the car ? I like everything about today !

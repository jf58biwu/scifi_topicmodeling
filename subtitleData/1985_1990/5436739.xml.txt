Translation by Jimbakyu Sync by Marian FLYING SNAKE ! SAVE BABY MONSTER We 're finally arriving in Koo-Nyo . Must 've been quite a job taking care of the Great Sibip . Wow ! Thank you , captain ! We can continue our journey ! Hold on . I have to take what I have to take . 80g for your fares , 50g for meals , 35g for water , 20g for lamp oil ... Aah .. Only this little ? As I expected ! Nice weather ! Nice ! Nice .. my foot ! Hey , I 'll buy you a lunch . Your treat ? ! As if I 'm a miser or something ! I 'm actually a man of mercy ... Besides , this might be the last farewell . Last farewell .. ? No way . Nah .. You 'll see what I mean . Uh .. ? Lasagna ... Hey ! Rana ! Told you I 'll buy you a lunch . Well , what am I gonna order .. ? Lasagna .. Leave it to me . Gum-Num 's leg . It 's delicious ! I 'll have one . But what kind of animal is " Gumu-Numu " ? I think you 'd better not know in order to enjoy the meal . Rana , you 'll have the same ? Lasagna .. Rana ! Aah .. Lasagna .. Aah .. Hey , watch your livestocks ! Darn , I can 't have lasagna and this is adding insult to injury ! Uh .. ? Lasagna ! Lasagna ! ... Never thought I was gonna see you here ! That one , I want that one ! Come on quick .. Lasagna .. Hmm .. Gum-Num .. Not bad ! Not .. Glad you like it . Pepo . About the lady you 're searching ... after Koo-Nyo , either cross the Kuri-Kuri desert by walking , or make a detour on " Pira " highway taking a carriage . Which route Prof. Anne took ? That 's the matter ... .. Woman traveling alone .. so it must be the carriage . How long do I have to wait ? Yes ! It 's coming ! The lasagna I have dreamt of .. Darn , I 'm gonna eat like crazy ! Rana ! This red thing isn 't tomato ... . That 's the blood of sea snake . Blood .. ? This white thing isn 't cheese .. ? That 's skin of man-eater fish . Bleaahh ... Ooh ... Oh ! Hey Toppy , what happened ? Hey ! Pepo . Ha .. ? What kind of animal are they ? Over there . Looks like ticket counter . Let 's go . Alright . Pepo ! Excuse me ! Aah .. ! Can I have tickets for that carriage over there ? Gum-Num , % $ # . % $ # $ # * % Gum-Num . What ? .. Is that Gum-Num ? Yuck ! I 'd rather be told what Gum-Num was ... # @ % # ! Seems money is not enough . Part time work again ? No , not again ! While we 're wasting time like this , Prof. Anne is continuing traveling ! What can we do ... ? [ Sibip singing ] How optimistic .. # % $ ` * % ! # % $ ... . $ % $ # ? It seems he 's asking if Sibip is a friend of ours . Yep , he 's our guide . % ' % # $ % $ % $ According to the captain , there 's one carriage every 3 days . Most likely Anne took the last carriage already . The next one will depart tomorrow at dawn , so we must be careful not to miss it . But where to stay tonight ? Setting it aside , how mysterious .. ! .. what is Sibip singing about ? Hey , Sibip ! Haha ha ! No use . Sibip doesn 't understand Earth language . Hmm .. Why don 't we teach him then ? Teach ? Earth language ? They say : " A thousand miles journey starts with a step " . I am Rana . I , Pepo . I am .. I. Uh .. No no , when you say to me , you should say " your name is Rana " . You , Pepo . Nooo ... ! Stop saying " Pepo , Pepo " ! Say " Rana " ! Rana ! Grr .. No ! YOU ARE Sibip , I am Rana ! Haa .. ! You moron ! I , Pepo ! I am I .. Yes .. I am I , but .. am Rana as well ... What ? Hotel ! Here it is ! Hello . Let 's .. go .. .. find another one ... . Yeah ... Better outside than here ... You mean sleeping in the open ? Sure hotels here are strange , but Vega III is still a primitive planet , so it must still be safer here than outside .. Toppy , it 's about time you noticed something . Notice what ? Yeaah .. ! Claustrophobia ? How come you 're a pilot ? I hate narrow places . But I got used to cockpit . Don 't touch on my complex ! Looks like a peaceful town , no problem to sleep outside ... Pepo ... Pepo ! As .. as I insisted , hotel is better .. No , how come ! Help ! Meadow is green , ocean of grass , wind blows .. What 's the matter with you guys , having this sullen look ? It 's campfire ! [ singing ] If anything bad happens , it 's all your fault Rana ! I see now what the Captain meant , the possible last farewell .. after the sunset , something awful must happen in this town ! That bell ring was a warning for it . How stupid we were , thanks to your claustrophobia , we 're all gonna die here .. ! We don 't know that yet ! Maybe is just that people here go to bed early ! Let 's enjoy ! Moon is so blue ... Rana ! Sshh .. Wha .. what 's the sound ? Anyone eating noodles or something ? Uh .. Haa .. ! Over there ! S .. s .. snakes ! What the hell ! Flying snakes ! Are .. are they poisonous ? How ... should I know ? I ... don 't .. wanna die ! What 's .. this snake ? It tickles me ! Undeveloped planet ! All over ! Hihi hi .. ! What the heck are they ? What was that after all ? Nothing to be scared of .. .. what a relief ! Eh .. ? Yeaah .. ! Hurry ! Aye .. ! Ouch ! What ? The baby of that animal ? Aah .. Go away ! Heeelp ! Rana , give the baby back ! What the heck ? Come on . Aargh .. ! What 's going on ? It must be that monster is active during night only , so its eyes degenerated and its nose works like an eye . That 's why it can 't see us in the water . But why did the monster try to kill its own baby ? That 's easy . That 's what happens to animals with sharp nose . For example , when a human touches a baby rabbit , the human smell sticks to the baby rabbit . When the baby gets back , the mother rabbit detects human smell on her baby and thinks it 's an enemy . That 's why the monster attacked its own baby . Exactly as you explained ! You got attacked by your mother because I held you ! Pity ! We must do something about this . You 're kidding .. Don 't tell me .. Oh yes ! This baby is left alone because of us . We must do our best to return this baby to its mother . There 's a limit to being a good person ! Absolutely . Why to risk our lives ? We need to find Prof. Anne .. But we can 't leave this baby alone . Mr. Toppy , it was you who persuaded me to continue by saying : " You 're running away ? You 'll get the answer to your proposal . " .. when I was almost giving up , on the ship some time ago . Eh .. ? What proposal ? I .. Never heard of it ? Toppy , let 's quit . So you 've made a proposal to Anne , and we have to go with your love affair and risk our lives ! How stupid ! It was your fault with claustrophobia ! You thought using my proposal as an excuse to quit this journey , didn 't you ? What ? ! I knew it . You were dazedly looking at people kissing good-bye on the ship , in tears seeing that Lasagna-like dishes . You 're just getting homesick ! No .. I 'm n ... . See ? I told you . It 's your fault to get us in danger , but not only you ignore your own fault but use my proposal issue as the reason to go back home . How mean ! You got scared . Shut up you immature bastard ! Fight logic . I don 't have any logic , that 's why I 'm shouting . Why don 't you see this , you moron ? Let 's go home , I can 't stand this anymore . We can 't , we 're worried about Prof. Anne .. Go home then if you want . It seems the journey will go smoother without you . I go home ! I go home now ! Shoot , I 'm fed up with dangers ! I 'll wait in spaceship . It 's safe there , plus I can contact the Earth . Ha .. Hmm .. Grr .. Shoot .. what the .. ? Ra .. na .. ! Good luck ! Pepo ! Ha .. Good riddance ! A bit too harsh , aren 't you ? Hmm .. Anyway , I 'll return this baby . Eh .. ? You 're serious ? Of course . I know how it feels , cause I 'm now a parent even though only for a short time . Kids need parents ' love and care . That 's too dangerous .. .. Mr Toppy .. ! Ah .. aah .. [ baby screaming ] The monster 's nest .. How to give the baby back .. ? Oh .. I 'm here to return your baby ! It 's your baby ! Why don 't you recognize it ? Pito ! Live ! .. sorry .. Toppy ! Giraffe ! Haa .. ! I shot tear bombs into the monster 's nose . Its nose is useless for a while . It 's the same as beeing blind . Toppy ! The monster is going mad with its nose disabled . The baby 's gonna get killed .. Maybe , but I want to believe ... Let 's trust them , the bond between mother and child must be strong .. Might be a bit naive , but I want to believe . Ah .. ? No ! Aah .. Oh .. ? Ha .. ! Yes ! The monster recognized the baby by physical contact ! Toppy ! By the time the monster 's nose recovers , the human smell must be gone from the baby . Happy ending . Not yet I 'm afraid .. We used to be four , but now .. only three .. Because Rana ran away selfishly ... Faces of Pito and our newly born baby came to my mind when I was almost killed a while ago .. I realized why Rana tries to avoid danger so much . You know , Rana has not only a wife but also seven kids . Uh .. ? You see , when you have a big family like Rana , you tend to be overprotective with yourself because your family depends totally on you . Surely Rana is coward , selfish , and has claustrophobia , a man with so many weak points . But .. do you remember , Sagitarius having trouble on the way to Vega III ? Yes . At that time , in fact I was thinking about going back , but Rana actually insisted repairing because he felt pity for you . Rana ? Maybe a bit twisted , but actually a warmhearted guy . Think about that monster a while ago . It was evil upon losing smell , but actually a kind animal . To get along with someone , you have to pinch and cover your nose . Don 't you think so ? You should ignore the weak points and try to see the good points instead . Yes . Pepo ! It 's dangerous to go back to the spaceship . But Prof. Anne .. Let 's catch the carriage ! Are you that perfect ? Too perfect to forgive even one faulty part ? Well , either take a carriage or go get Rana back . You decide ! Part time job ? I gave you part time job the last time because you were with Great Sibip . I can 't give you a job if you ask , and I can 't let you on board for free either , so forgive me . Ooh .. ? How .. heartless .. ! Rana ! It seems we 're too late ... Now .. we 're apart ...

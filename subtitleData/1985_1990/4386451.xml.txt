 Captain 's log , star date 41723.9 . Following a Starfleet order , we are in the Xendi Sabu star system , having rendezvoused with a Ferengi vessel which requested a meeting . Although we arrived and made appropriate signals three days ago , the Ferengi have responded only with the message , " Stand by , Enterprise . " You sent for me , sir ? Yes , Doctor . Sit down . Look , this ... perhaps may be nothing , but I 've been feeling ... .. a bit odd of late . Fatigued . And now I 've got this damned headache . A what ? Headache . You know what a headache is . Of course . But I don 't often encounter them . The reason is obvious , of course . What are the Ferengi up to ? " Stand by , Enterprise . " Stand by for what ? I don 't see a thing wrong . No , neither can l . Unless they 're baiting some kind of trap . With your head . I see nothing physically wrong , but I 'll run some scans in sickbay . - All I 've got ... - Is an order . Report to sickbay ! From the only person aboard who can give you an order . Captain , from First Officer . They 're sending a message . On my way , Number One . Sorry , Doctor . Duty calls . - They 're prepared to talk , sir . - Have they explained the wait ? Negative . They 've identified their commander as Bok . DaiMon Bok . You can see him . They 're communicating on visual . Open hailing frequencies . Frequencies open , sir . This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise . We are transmitting visually . Is this the Capt Picard ? - Do we know each other ? - I know you , Picard . Then you have the advantage of me . Is this Bok ? I am Bok , DaiMon of the Ferengi . I have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem , Captain . What problem , DaiMon Bok ? I insist on speaking of that matter in person . Shall we meet on your vessel ... or mine ? Hailing frequencies closed . I sense considerable deception on Bok 's part . And danger . Then we should meet him here . Keep him under our control . Now open , sir . I appreciate your offer , DaiMon Bok . Please be our guest here . As you wish , Picard . Perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples . In one Earth hour , then ? In one hour , DaiMon Bok . End transmission . I can 't believe they 're coming here . They did agree a bit easily . Well , in one hour we shall know why . Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission , to explore strange new worlds , ... .. to seek out new life and new civilizations , ... .. to boldly go where no one has gone before . Are you accustomed to getting your own way ? Only when it makes sense . There 's 40 minutes until the Ferengi beam over . I 'll have these scans done in ten . A lot of effort for a simple headache . You should not have a headache unless something 's wrong . It 's true that headaches were once quite common , before the brain was charted , before we understood the nature of pain . When we suffered from things such as the common cold . - So what 's the cause of my headache ? - I haven 't the slightest idea . Feel better ? - The pain 's gone . - Medical fakery . The pain is actually still there . It 's just cloaked . - I 'll want further exams . - Doctor ! When the Ferengi matter is settled . Expect an intruder alert . What ? Have you something to report ? If you 'll scan heading 44 , mark 163 ... Intruder alert , sir . I 've got something , sir . An old-style starship , Constellation class , travelling on impulse power . Says who ? Ensign , answer the First Officer 's question . Says the long-distance sensors , sir . I was boosting the sensor output ... Boosting it ? How ? We will discuss this later . I 'm reading it now , as a Constellation-class starship travelling under impulse power . Sending no call letters . The correct procedure ... What 's wrong , sir ? It 's nothing . It 's just a ... mild headache . The correct procedure , Ensign , was to signal the bridge immediately . - Yes , sir . - Bringing it here personally , perhaps to be on hand for the Ferengi beam-over , might have imperilled us were it something hostile . Yes , sir . Receiving no signal from the approaching starship . Time , sir . Time ? For the Ferengi beam-over . Do you see any problem connected with this old starship ? It 's safer to have the Ferengi here , whatever . Concur . Stand by . Hailing frequencies open . Welcome in peace , DaiMon Bok . It is our pleasure , Capt Picard . Might I introduce my First Officer , Kazago , and my Second , Rata ? This is my First Officer , Cmdr William Riker . Second-in-command , Data . Counsellor Troi . We have heard that you use females . Clothed females . Most interesting . - They are that , sir . - And the android was mentioned , too . What is its price ? We should like to ... purchase it . He is not for sale . Cmdr Data is ... Second-hand merchandise . You wouldn 't want him . Second-hand , sir ? Of course . A human joke . Excuse me , Captain . The unidentified starship is coming . Still no signal . Think nothing of it . It is under our control . One of our starships under your control ? Do not be alarmed , Captain . It is a gift from us . With which we honour the hero of Maxia . - Who ? - Why you , Picard , of course . Do you not remember the Battle of Maxia ? I 'm sorry , I do not remember it , DaiMon Bok . Data ? He may refer to an encounter nine years ago , in the Maxia Zeta system . - An unidentified starship ... - Unidentified ? ! That fine vessel was Ferengi . Which ... you destroyed , sir . The Battle of Maxia . I never heard it referred to so dramatically before . My sincere regrets , but that vessel refused to identify itself . It simply attacked us . We defended ourselves . Such ... mistakes happen in space . Hardly a mistake , sir . Your report shows it deliberately attacked . Do you want arriving vessel on main viewer ? It 's 1,000 kilometers away . Put it on your viewer . Main viewer . There is no one aboard it . The log should be downloaded into the Enterprise 's records . At a price . No price ! No price ? What is the purpose of this ? What ... I felt something too , Captain . Perhaps it is ... his conscience . Bridge to sickbay ... No , I 'm fine . It felt as if ... it were something from your past . It 's alright . I 'm fine . What is this about ? It is about the battle I mentioned , Captain . A gift , in honour of that occasion . Look at that ship closely . - Magnify it , please , Lt. La Forge . - Aye , sir . Why , ... .. it 's the Stargazer . It 's my old ship . How did you find it ? It was a derelict . Adrift in space on the far side of this star system . How it got there is none of my business , Captain . But now , ... that vessel is yours , if you wish to have it . We are not selling it to him ? Consider it ... an act of friendship . At no cost ? Ugly ! Very ugly ! Captain 's log , supplemental . Bok and his officers have returned to their vessel , inviting us to take possession of the Stargazer . - Like before ? - No , it hit with more impact . Hit ? I 'm sorry , but anything could be important . - You felt something yourself ? - I believe so . Like a thought , but ... rather mechanical in nature . Sure it wasn 't one of my thoughts ? At that moment , I was remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer . A manoeuvre was being made . We were hit . Something 's burning . I can smell smoke . Can you ? There 's nothing burning , Jean-Luc . That was just part of my memory . Memory or nightmare ? It was strong , whatever it was . Ready , Number One ? Staff 's waiting , if Dr. Crusher approves . I 'll do better than that . I 'll go along . We were travelling through the Maxia system . An unidentified ship appeared and fired on us , point-blank range . Where did it come from ? It must have been lying in some deep moon crater . First attack damaged the shields . In the confusion , they hit us again . - No clue who they were ? - No names , no reason . Can you identify them , Vigo ? If they come a second time ... Sir , who 's Vigo ? My weapons officer on the Stargazer . I 'm getting caught up in this . Your shields were failing , sir . I ... improvised . With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill , I ordered a sensor bearing . When it made the return arc ... You performed what Starfleet texts now call the Picard Manoeuvre . I did what any good helmsman would . Dropped into high warp , stopped right off the enemy 's bow , and fired ! Blowing into maximum warp , you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once . Our attacker fired on the wrong one . " I did what any good helmsman would " ! You did it first , sir . It was a save-our-skins manoeuvre . We were finished . On fire . We had to abandon ship . We limped through space in shuttles for weeks before we were picked up . I haven 't thought about this for years . Sir , the Ferengi are waiting for us to take possession of the Stargazer . - I want to go over to her . - I understand , sir . As soon as my people make sure she 's safe . And after I have another look at you . USS Stargazer . Constellation class . Starfleet Registry NCC-2893 . I activated the emergency power cells . Amazing they still work . The rest of this ship is clear of surprises , Lt. Yar . I read of this ship at the Academy . I never dreamed I 'd ever be on her . Yar to Enterprise . All clear , sir . Hello , old friend . You 'll find this most intriguing , sir . What did you find , Data ? The last entry , dated nine years ago , sir . By you . " We are forced to abandon our starship . " " May she find her way without us . " Apparently she did , sir . - How do you feel , Captain ? - I 'm fine , Doctor . Lt. Yar , run a structural analysis on the Stargazer for an impulse tow . Data , download all computers to the Enterprise and file . I 'm going to look at my old cabin . Try this , hero of Maxia ! Captain ? Another headache ? This worries me . I want you back on the Enterprise . But my things ... I 'll see they 're sent to your Enterprise quarters . Enterprise now taking possession of Stargazer , Kazago . Permission granted . It was quite a bargain . I thought the Ferengi always made a profit . Sub warp speed for towing , La Forge . Aye , sir . Starfleet has answered our request . A tug will meet us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Star base 9 . Very well , Data . - How was it , Captain ? - Very strange , Number One . Like going back to the house you grew up in , but no one 's home . - Except phantoms of the past . - It has troubled you ? Not half as much as this damned headache . Take over , Number One . Aye , sir . What 's wrong ? I wish I could say . Shields weakening , Captain . Torpedoes armed . Where are they ? Oh , my God , sir ! Fire ! What is it , Data ? Why all the mystery ? The records of the Stargazer . What the Ferengi call the Battle of Maxia . The Captain 's personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official account . What are you saying ? It appears that the starship which Capt Picard attacked - had been under a flag of truce . - What ? He destroyed the ship without notice or provocation . What about the fire on the Stargazer ? - An accident in Engineering . - And what proof ? It is logged in his own voice , sir . Would you care to hear it , sir ? Sir ? This is a confession given by me , Jean-Luc Picard , commanding USS Stargazer . - What is this ? - I don 't know . Sounds like you . - It is ! - I refuse to believe you said that . I must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster . Unfortunately , I fired our main phasers and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel . I assume they simulated your voice . I already put Data to work on it . I never made that log entry , but it leaves you with a duty to perform . I know , sir . I must report to Starfleet . That 's at least one day for communication to reach there . And one more day for their answer to return . I 'd like the truth of this by then . I 'd hate to prepare a formal defence . - They can 't ask for your command . - Why not ? With the Ferengi making friendship overtures , I 'd be a severe embarrassment to Starfleet . I 'm sure the Ferengi are behind the faked log . No wonder they 're waiting out there . Headache back , sir ? Damn ! I 'll call the Doctor again . It 's no wonder , with all this going on . Try to relax . This is a confession given by me , Jean-Luc Picard , commanding USS Stargazer , in the hopes that my belated honesty will be considered by Starfleet , when judging my actions during a confrontation with an unidentified vessel . Open hailing frequencies , Geordi . I 'll take it in the ready room . Secure channel . Secure , sir . Starship Ferengi , this is Cmdr Riker here . I 'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago . A problem , Riker ? Are our channels secure ? It is now . You know the details of the Battle of Maxia ? Capt Bok has made me aware of it . The infamy of your Picard is now known . Infamy ? I 'd call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy . And if I produced evidence that Capt. Picard 's log entry was falsified ... I hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle . - What do you want of me ? - One question . As you humans say , I 'm all ears . First Officer to First Officer , Kazago . If your Capt Bok knew about this , why this peaceful meeting to present the Stargazer ? We give back your derelict warship and you accuse us of crime , Riker ? I can bear no more insults ! Yes , who the hell is it ? - Not resting , Captain ? - More like dying , Doctor . Over here . What is wrong with me ? I wish to hell I knew , but something unusual is definitely happening . Doctors say the obvious like it 's a revelation . Captains always act like they 're immortal . No ! You didn 't tell me it had been this bad . It wasn 't this bad . But it 's getting worse . This should help a little . It must be some emotional pressure connected with the Stargazer . I got this headache long before I even knew my old ship still existed . Still , perhaps you 're partly right . Want to talk about it ? I 'm here . The fight at Maxia . I destroyed an entire vessel . An entire crew . Did you have a choice ? I don 't know any more . I don 't know . Cmdr Riker told me about the altered log if that 's troubling you . The last three nights , I 've ... .. I 've heard these voices . I 'm on the bridge of my old ship . There 's fire all around me . The klaxons , smoke . And then I give the order . And now the Stargazer is really here . And that log ... Am I going crazy ? Was I in my right mind at Maxia ? Am I in my right mind now ? What was that ? Something to let you sleep . Yes , sleep . Sleep ... Shields weakening , Captain ! Torpedoes armed . Where are they ? And now , my dear Captain , you are ready to live the past . Where did they come from ? Phasers , sir ? What should we do , sir ? Should we fire back ? Fire , Captain ? You will injure yourself , as you once injured me . Sir ! Damage report . Fusion generator under surge control , sir ! Power systems failing . Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship ! Seven , mark 19 , sir . Phasers , sir ? Ready phasers , and lock ! Stand by on warp nine . Heading , ... seven-seven , mark 20 . Engage ! Steady ! Now , reverse and stop ! Phasers fire , torpedoes away ! Fire . By comparing the Stargazer 's main computer log with Capt Picard 's personal log , I found some discrepancies , sir . What does that mean ? All information is time-coded . The bits produce an aggregate ... I don 't want a computer-science lesson . Bottom line . One of these two logs is a forgery . Correction . The log just found aboard the Stargazer is a forgery . As I said , that is one of them , is it not ? Captain ! You 're looking better , sir . A little sleep , thanks to the good Doctor , works wonders . What report on the logs ? Whoever tampered with your log was clever . But clumsy . It 's definitely a fabrication . Number One , I 'd like you to take a look at this brain-scan graph ... - What are you doing here ? - Aren 't I the Captain ? - Yes , but ... - Thank you for the confirmation . But now , except for Riker , if you 'd all return to your stations . - Is that clear ? - Sir . You too , Doctor . I have business with the Commander . Under protest , sir . You have orders for me ? Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam . - Sir ? - The tractor beam . Sir , are you abandoning ? No . But her inertia will carry the Stargazer along with us . Or did you sleep through the Academy lecture on the conservation of tractor-beam power ? No , sir . I 'll release her , of course . Obviously , there 's some thought-process disorder . But I can 't find a physical reason for it . Anything ? I 'm puzzled , too . I keep sensing random thoughts . But two sets of them . As if they were his , but intermixed with other thoughts which are also his . - I 'm busy , Wesley . - I know , but this is important . I was at the sensors in Engineering , trying sensitivity tests ... Does this have something to do with Capt Picard ? Yes , ma 'am . If this is what you 're talking about . I don 't know about brain scans , but I glanced at these . I noticed that these patterns are the same as the low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi ship . I went back and checked . They 're exactly the same . - What kind of transmissions ? - I don 't know . Engineering has nothing like it on record . - Let 's get to the Captain . - No , they may affect him . To Riker . You 're welcome , ladies . Adults ! The Captain ? Resting , after ordering you to return to your duty stations . There have been some ... Did he say low intensity ? Unusual low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel . - Did who say ? - My son . Transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies found in the Captain 's scans . Something over there is affecting the Captain 's thought patterns . Computer , give me a location on Capt Picard . Capt Picard is in transporter room three . What ? Emergency order to transporter room three . New information . Capt Picard is no longer aboard the Enterprise . Welcome back , Captain . What is happening ? Shields up , computer . - What are you doing ? - Collecting on an old debt . Stargazer , Captain , respond ! Shields up . No way to beam over . I 'm reading something very strange here . A low-intensity beam of intermittent pulse , inside this starship . I have a fix on it , sir . Inside Capt Picard 's quarters . You transferred his belongings from the Stargazer ? Yes . Including a fairly heavy chest . Take a look , fast ! Commander , Stargazer is now powering up , sir . I have been waiting a long nine years for this , Picard . - I don 't know what you mean . - Do you not , human ? Can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood ? - You murdered my only son ! - Your son ? He was commander of the ship you destroyed . On his first voyage as DaiMon . The ship ... ? The Ferengi vessel that attacked me . Or is it about to attack me ? And I have spent these years , searching , ... seeking , ... .. a proper blood revenge ! And I found it ! I am rich , Picard . Yet , two of these cost me the profits of an entire life ! You are back in command of the Stargazer , Picard . Its computers will answer your orders . Die well , Captain ! First Officer 's log . Capt Picard has beamed aboard the Stargazer , which is moving away from us under its own power . Enterprise to Stargazer , please respond ! Enterprise to Capt Picard aboard Stargazer . Please answer ! Data , what was Stargazer 's condition ? Fire damage to interior surfaces , but no main systems were crippled . Armaments , Lt. Yar ? Six photon torpedoes short from when the Captain destroyed the Ferengi . Otherwise fully armed . - What is it , La Forge ? - A network of miniature circuitry . Incredibly complex . Maybe an amplifier . Where was it in the Captain 's quarters ? His chest from the Stargazer , sir ? Where I left it . He hadn 't unpacked . He may not have known it was there . If this can pick up or magnify thought-altering transmissions ... It could prepare him for what 's happening now . Let 's find out . Or try to . Contact the Ferengi vessel , Lieutenant . Hailing frequencies open , sir . Enterprise to Ferengi vessel . We transmit visually . Do you respond ? Why is our gift to you under power , human ? - I 'll discuss it with your Captain . - He is in our laboratory . Where is your Captain ? He 's beamed aboard the Stargazer . I 'm wondering if this has something to do with it . How do you have possession of that ? It was in our Captain 's chest , from the Stargazer . It is a forbidden device . A ... thought-maker . If your Captain is criminal enough to own one ... You know who controls those spheres . I ask you again . First Officer to First Officer . What 's going on ? It is not seemly to question one 's own DaiMon , Riker . I am not prepared to do that . - Sir , I have the Stargazer . - Switch , now ! Enterprise to Picard . Do not attack again ! We 're on a peaceful mission ! Give your identity ! You force us to defend ourselves . Phasers full up . Arm torpedoes . Why aren 't the shields at full power ? - We 've lost him , sir . - When he put up the shields . Damn ! I said get the fusion generators under surge control ! You 're moving much too slowly ! Arm the torpedoes , man ! Vigo , get a fire-control party up here ! Shields weakening , Captain . Fusion generator on line . - Weapons report ? - Phasers coming to full charge . Torpedoes armed . Who are they ? Identify them . They 're coming for a third pass at us . We can 't take another hit , Captain . Sir , I now feel anger from our Captain . Fury over whatever he is reliving out there . The Battle of Maxia , sir . The Picard Manoeuvre . What is the defence , Data ? - There is no defence , sir . - Devise one . Fast ! First Officer Kazago to human Riker . Not now , Kazago . We do not wish to become involved in what is clearly a Federation matter . Fine , fine . Enterprise out . You should know that DaiMon Bok no longer commands this vessel . His First Officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable venture . Good luck , First Officer Riker . I have computed a possibility . Deep space contains trace gases . A vessel in the Picard Manoeuvre might seem to disappear , but our sensors can locate compression of these gases . An aiming point to blow up our Captain ? This class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it . Seize it . Limit its field of fire . Concentrate shields at that point . Make it so . I hope you 're right . No question of it , sir . Stand by . Lock on tractor beam . Ready phasers . Capt Picard . Listen to me . - Vigo , is that you ? - It 's Cmdr Riker , sir . Captain , hear me ! Look around . The Ferengi are using thought devices on you . Stand by . Who is this ? It 's Riker , sir . Your Number One . Look for a silver sphere . Destroy it with your phaser ! Phaser ... A sphere . - Bok used it . - Destroy it ! Phaser ... Destroy the sphere . Are you alright , Captain ? Captain ... ? Captain , are you alright ? Where am I , Number One ? Aboard the Stargazer , sir . - The sphere was controlling your ... - Bok ! Where is Bok ? Removed from command . Placed under guard for his act of vengeance . Seems there was no profit in it . In revenge , there never is . Let the dead rest . And the past ... .. remain the past . Enterprise , lock on . Beam me home , Riker .

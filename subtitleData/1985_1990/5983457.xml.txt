 [ theme music ] [ shatters ] [ tires screeching ] [ music continues ] I don 't know how long it 's going to set us back . And then I spent all morning figuring out how to turn that thing over . Turn it over ? It 'll be easier just to build on top of it . Do you know who did it , Mr. Hogan ? A bunch of environmental fanatics from your college . They left a calling card ? They didn 't have to . Look , I 'm not faulting your students too much . I know they 're concerned about the environment but I 'm trying to build housing for the poor . That 's a problem alright . How about a shot of you in front of it ? Give people an idea just how big it really is . Weighs more than 15 tones . Must 've taken the whole football team to do it . [ clicks ] When we get back to campus , we 'll do some snooping around and see what we come up with . I 'm not interested in pressing charges . I don 't want anything else to happen . It 's important to me and the community . - So tell ' em to lay off , okay ? - Okay . ( Hogan ) Frank , on the double . [ clears throat ] I warned them . They should 've listened to me . Good morning . Who are you ? I 'm Clark Kent . I 'm a reporter for the Shuster Herald . They didn 't believe me , so I had to show them . Show them what ? That they 're not in control of the wetlands . My people have lived here since the beginning of time and we 'll still be here at the end of it . Did your-did your people do that ? No . Do you know who did ? The birds did it . Birds ? The birds did it . [ chuckles ] She 's got to be kidding . I mean , she 's a bird herself . She 's a kook . She 's .. Oh , I suppose you have a better explanation . Yeah , a very simple one . His driver had a couple of beers too many . He was driving too fast took the turn too quickly and , bingo , we got ourselves a flip . Degree of difficulty 6.5 . Yeah , right . T .J. , there were no skid marks . Yeah , well , it rained last night . That washed the skid marks out , huh ? The earth mover was rolled over on the driver 's side , right ? If there was anyone , they 'd be badly hurt or even killed . Probably had so much to drink nothing could 've hurt him , huh ? Did you see the way those birds reacted to her ? Yeah , she feeds them breadcrumbs . They like her . No , I think there might be something to that bird story . - You think the birds did it ? - You don 't know . You think , they maybe had some help ? Maybe the woodchucks , or the squirrels lent a hand . You know , all those creatures of the forest stick together . Ha-ha . You 're very funny , you know ? No , I 'm serious . I think , that Indian stuff is a cover . Next time we see her , let 's just call her Snow White and see if she answers . - Pull over . - What ? Pull over up here . Why ? Where , where you going ? I 'm gonna have a look around . Okay , but , you know , forget the stunts on this thing . I don 't want to pick you up with a blotter . Worry , worry . God ! Birds ! [ theme music ] [ dramatic music ] [ theme music ] You are the enemy . You pushed back the earth mover . I 'm not the enemy , neither is the builder of the project . This development is for the poor . Forests are being destroyed . Lakes and streams dried up . Animals stop existing . This is only one small housing development . Little by little , the land as nature made it , disappears . No one 's out to hurt anyone . A compromise must be made . Both sides have to give . My people have given enough . I will speak with the developer . I promise , something will be done . Another promise , only to be broken . Trust me , please . [ clears throat ] Where 's Clark ? He 's buying a birthday present for his mother . Oh . Hey , listen up , everybody . You know that housing project ? The builder thinks that some college students pulled a giant prank last night , and I mean giant . Does anybody know anything about that ? What kind of prank ? An earth mover was overturned . I 'll explain it to you later at the coffee shop , 7 o ' clock . You know that development should 've never been permitted . Ah , here we go again . No , once that forest is cut down and cemented over it 's finished . It never grows back , and it always adds to that greenhouse effect . You know , a wise man once said " Ecology and progress must somehow find a way to live together . " What wise man was that ? Clark Kent . Ah . Ah ! [ bell tolling ] Oh . Oh , hey , when you talk to your mom wish her happy birthday for me . Well , thanks , Lana . Yeah , what did you get her ? Nothing yet . I need help . Can you guys , lend me some good taste ? Lana , can you lend me some of your good taste ? Sure . Um , I have a little time today so . Uh , T.J. , drop of my assignment for me . - I can 't make journalism . - Where are you going ? I 've an appointment with Hogan . - This is the only time he had . - What about me ? He said no pictures , man . ( Hogan ) I 'm not going I 'm just happy who ever turned it over put it back again . Well , I don 't think there 'll be any more problems as long as everyone is reasonable . When I was in college I blew off a lot of steam myself . Ah , what do you mean , reasonable ? Well , certain compromises have to be made . Ah , look this project has fallen way behind as it is and there are lots of people waiting desperately to move in . Mr. Hogan , I was talking with the Indian woman , and she 's- - She 's crazy ! Crazy ! She talks to birds . Mr. Hogan , she might be crazy , but she makes a lot of sense when she talks about the wetlands being developed . Look , kid , I 'm caught between a rock in a hard place . I 'll tell you what .. ... I 'll talk to the mayor . I 'll talk to the city council . I 'll-I 'll see what I can do . I 'd appreciate it , Mr. Hogan . In the meantime , I 'll put the project on hold . That 's great . Mr. Hogan , I don 't know how to thank you . Thanks again , Mr. Hogan . [ no audio ] That woman is causing us more trouble than she 's worth . Tell me about it . We 've lost two crews . Scared away by her Indian mumbo jumbo and stupid magic spells . And on top of that she 's talked to the city council and held up our permits . Then made a big stink at the bureau of Indian affairs . Yeah , you just say the word and she 's history . I just said it . Oh , how 'd the pictures turn out ? Oh , terrific . Hey , take a look . Oh , yeah . That 's nice . Bebe Fisher , where 'd you get this ? That 's great . Hey , that 's the wrong batch of film . Man ! So , uh , how did things turn out with Hogan ? Listen , come here . " Builder bows to environment , " by Clark Kent . " The controversial low-income housing project at the wetlands has been put on hold . " How 'd you do that ? Hogan 's a decent guy . Last of a dying breed . Why are you always so cynical ? That 's part of being a newspaper man . Cynicism 101 . Oh , do me a favor . Take this to layout . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna go tell the Indian woman the good news . Say hello to Bebe Fisher for me . [ insects chirping ] [ frogs croaking ] You again . Just wanted say I spoke with the builder and he stopped work . He understands the problem . The construction has not stopped . That 's impossible . I just spoke with him . Two liars talking to each other only make more lies . I 'm not lying . You must trust me . You 've done enough harm . You cannot be trusted . [ rattling ] For your treachery . You who have betrayed the sacred ground will suffer for it . Ah . [ rattling ] " Was covered " , is an example of the pluperfect tense . It denotes an action or state as completed before a past time , specified or implied . I am getting through to you people , aren 't I ? Present tense , question ? T.J. Ah , Mr. White I believe Mr. Kent is trying to contact you without disrupting the class which , of course , he has done . I 'm sorry , Professor Rogers . Well , Mr. White . Move it . An action verb . ( T.J. ) Yes , ma 'am . ( Rogers ) Miss Lang , Mr. Kent was I don 't know why I 'm taking English . I 'm a photographer , aren 't I ? We 've been had . Hogan 's a liar . He never stopped work on that project . I 've had it with this tense . He 's got some explaining that 's all I know . - I hope she doesn 't flunk me . - Will you come on ? Let 's go . - Where ? - To see Hogan . What about that article you wrote , um " Builder bows to environment ? " Advanced stupidity 3A . I should 've doubled checked . If Hogan knows this is going to be on the front page then maybe we 'll get some answers . - From him ? - Yes . [ chanting ] Ah ! Come on . [ dramatic music ] [ cawing ] [ hissing ] [ screech ] Take it easy , will you , Clark ? I can 't believe how naive I was to be taken in by that . We 're not going to be much good wrapped around a tree . " Kid , I 'm stuck between a rock in a hard place . " Yeah , you 're beautiful when you 're angry , Clark . I can 't blame the Indian woman for feeling I 'm the enemy . She put me under some spell . I lost all my powers . Powers ? What are you talking about , powers ? Powers , powers . Mental powers . I mean , I could hardly think . I mean , even now I 'm being vague . Yeah , a little . [ tires screech ] What can I do for you ? We 're looking for Mr. Hogan . Well , you can see he 's not in here . Can you tell us where he is ? Who wants to know ? We 're reporters for the Herald . This is T.J. White . I 'm Clark Kent . Well , I 'll tell him you were looking for him . Okay . Take some pictures , T.J. Okay . Hey , hey , what are you doing ? Put that camera away . Who told you to take pictures ? He did . Put the camera away , do you hear me ? Put it away , you hear ? You can 't take pictures . Hey , it 's the public 's right to know . You are begging for trouble . He doesn 't want us to take pictures . Don 't take them . Let 's just go . Come on . Hey , Clark . Well , get a load of this . Trans Allied steel . " Gentlemen , this is a caution to you " that the shipment of steel .. Ta-da-da-da " is not suitable for construction purposes . " As recorded earlier the cost of construction quality steel is four times the " - - We rejected that shipment . Look , we haven 't done business with Trans Allied steel for months now . Yeah ? Well , someone 's been playing trick or treat with you , buddy because you 've got a million tons of steel there that 's marked Trans Allied steel . I think you better tell us where Mr. Hogan is . - What do you think , T.J. ? - Yeah , I think so . Yeah , I think I 'd better . He 's at the South Lake construction site . Thanks a lot . Phew ! Trans Allied . Can you believe what a scam this is ? I mean , Hogan charges the city top dollar for construction quality material and ends up using this , this low quality junk . Get pictures of every piece of garbage material here . This man is dead meat . It 's gonna make some story , huh ? Yeah . Call the city building inspector . Let him know and call the cops too . - Okay . - Alright . [ cawing ] [ hissing ] [ theme music ] [ theme music continues ] Thank you for saving my life . I was wrong about you . You were right about a lot of things . I made a promise to you . I 'm on my way to make good on it . Thank you . Damn ! The building inspector and the cops . Think of me as a friend of the court . - What court ? - Criminal . Starting at the bottom of the list , you 're a liar . Second of all , you 're a vicious cheat . Stealing from the city and endangering people 's lives by building with inferior materials . You don 't know what you 're talking about . And worst of all , you 're a would be murderer . Attempting to kill an old woman . Now . There . [ dramatic music ] [ police siren wailing ] Get my lawyer . Alright , get my lawyer . You can 't do this to me . You can 't .. What ? I wan 't ... I have my rights . Hogan . I 'm a developer . Get away . ( Clark ) T.J. , they look In their natural habitat . - Hey , hey , hey . - Ha . Sweet . I 'm developing houses for the poor , you .. Argh ! What 's the matter , Clark ? I just don 't like the way this article sounds . It makes all construction workers seem like thieves . Hogan is the exception . " Low-income housing project at the wetlands " that has caused such an ecological furore " has been cancelled . " City council has pledged to find another place in town to build . " Wait . Oh , there is one mistake , Clark . [ phone rings ] There 's only two ' R " s in furore , not three . Yeah , he is . Just a minute . Clark , it 's your mother . Ahem . Hello , Ma . Present , what present ? I didn 't get you a pr .. Yeah , well . I mean , how do you like it ?

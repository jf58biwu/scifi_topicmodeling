Bits K. Gevorkyan Camera U. Yakovlev Hi Hi What 's new ? Manohin had a pipe burst at the factory . How 's the star schoolboy ? He 's out playing ... Vovka , pop out for some bread . I forgot it , can you ? And I don 't think there 's enough macaroni . Comrade , that man says he 's from another planet . We need to do something . Call emergency . I will , but he 's barefoot , he 'll catch cold . Hello ! Hello . Excuse my bad smell . It 's so cold . So I found this in an iron bin . Fine . Friend ! Tell me the number of your planet in the tenture ? Or at least the number of your galaxy in the spiral ? I got my contacts mixed up and now I can 't return home . We know the number , but we cannot remember it now , my friend . This lad will go to a bureau to look it up . And you will wait with me at the bakers , okay ? And put this on , for the time being ... Thank you ... Listen , my friends . There 's no need for the bakers , nor for the bureau . This is my planet ... 247 in tenture , galaxy Beta in the Spiral . With this my space travel machine . So which co-ordinates do I press in order to travel home ? You see , time is relative - do you understand this ? Let me make a suggestion . We 'll just press this contact and travel to your home . But if this machine doesn 't work , then you travel with us to where we want to take you , okay ? No , please don 't . You need to know exactly . Yes we can ... So what can you see ? Eh ? Sand ... So that shitty gadget worked ... and that idiot , with his holes , he stayed behind ? Don 't worry ... There 's the sun , there 's sand , there 's gravity . Where are we ? We 're on Earth . Or ... Or ? No , let 's take it we 're on Earth , in some desert ... So ? Karakumi ? Eh ? What other deserts do we have ? Gobi , Sahara ... No , I said , do WE have ! The only other one is the Kyzylkumi . No . Let 's take it that it 's the Karakumi . Eh ? So that means ... The sun 's in the west ... so , Ashabad is this way . Understood ? Let 's go ! Come on ! Comrade , what 's your name ? Vladimir Nikolaevich . And I 'm Gedevan . Pleased to meet you ... You have a bottle in your bag , is it wine ? No , it 's wine vinegar . And some herbs - coriander . So we 'll live well . Vladimir Nikolaevich , do you remember what number was given by the guy who took my socks ? No . Only maybe we 're on the planet , he came from ? Listen , Skripach ! Whatever we guess , it 's all the same and won 't change a thing ! Now we choose a direction and go . The most important thing is to reach water . Alright ? Vladimir Nikoaevich , I want to put my slippers on . Well , put them on ! Then wait ! What 's the time ? Four . In the morning ? Yes ... Are you late ? I feel uncomfortable ... I phoned the airport to say I 'd be there in an hour . And here we are ... Are you studying at the conservatory ? No , it 's not mine . It 's from Prof. Rogozin . He gave a concert for us , and they forgot to put the violin in the plane . A banquet ? No , just a dinner ... Ah ! Are you from Tibilisi ? No , Batumi . I thought I 'd return the violin , and still have time to catch the train . I study textiles in Ivanovo . Aha ... First I tried to enter the MGIMO , the Institute of International Relations , but they told me that ... Quiet ! ... A man ... Hello ... We 're in the West . Do you know any languages ? English . Some French . Tell them we have no money ... Tell them we can 't pay them . Hello ! We are from a group of tourists and we 've strayed from the group . Take us to the town , there we 'll manage it by ourselves . Translate . Hello .. Chatl ! No money . Our money , documents , - all is left with the tour guide . It 's an accident ... We left our bus just for a minute and lost it in the sands . Take it . It 's warm . Excuse me , what ? You want my hat ? I 'm sorry ... it 's not mine , I can 't give it away . There 's nothing in there . Open it . It 's not wine , it 's vinegar . Sour , eh ? Well friend so it 's agreed ? You 'll take us ? Skripach , quickly ... Like I said we must get to the town , and there we 'll manage it ! Want the sweater ? Bastards ! Good that I kept the violin . Now they feel ashamed ! What ' Ktse ' ? He seems to want the matches . You want the matches ? There . The whole box ? Take us away from here , and we 'll give you the ' koo ' . No " Made in " in here , not a letter ... Excuse me , I don 't understand ... What do they want ? They want ' koo ' ! Thank you ... He wants me to wear the bell . He won 't get it . I 'll wear it , Vladimir Nikolaevich , if it makes him happy ... Go ahead ! All right , I 'm persuaded . I 'll smoke , if that 's all right with you ... Quiet , quiet , quiet ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , maybe we really are on ... Yes ! They 're typical Martians . Lusya , darling , why did you only need those macaroni ! So . We speak Russian , don 't we ? Why was it necessary to conceal it ? We didn 't conceal it . It 's very difficult to fathom a language , when you always think in two languages . And that Patsak is talking all the time in languages , the rest of which he doesn 't know . Why are you staring at me , maimoona verishvilo ? They speak Georgian too ... What did he say ? Ape , son of a donkey . So . We 're from the Soviet Union , here on a cultural exchange . Authorities know about us , and where we are , and they search for us . If you don 't let us contact our embassy , there will be large scale repercussions , is that clear ? We don 't understand ' embassy ' , put on the tsak quickly ! That means you understand macaroni and maimuni , but you don 't know what 's an embassy , idiots . I 've had enough ! You 're morons , understand ? You thought about macaroni so I could say it . This is not the Earth , and not Africa , my friend . It 's the planet Pluke , 215 in tenture , galaxy Kin Dza Dza in the Spiral , clear ? Shit ... That 's a situation . Put on the tsak , my friend ... Put it on . There we are , well done . Excuse me , where are we ? Sh ! Íe has very sensitive ears . Do you know the tenture of your own planet ? Tenture ? Well , at least the number of your galaxy in the Spiral . In the Spiral ? In the Spiral . The Spiral ... Our planet Earth ... it orbits with such planets as Venus , Saturn , Mars , Jupiter ... What others , Vladimir Nikolaevich ? The Great Bear . Vladimir Nikolaevich , come here . On your planet do you have more matches ? Well , you 'll find them . How many will you give us if we set you back there ? How many do you need ? Two boxes like these ! Seven ! Seven . And give me what you have now , I will buy a gravitsapa on it . Sorry , but what is a gravitsapa ? Without a gravitsapa a pepelats can only fly like this , but with one it can reach any point in the Universe in five seconds . My friends , how come you take your pepelats from the garage without a gravitsapa ? That 's no good practice . We had a gravitsapa . But when we arrived here , it was stolen . Aha . But don 't you have a space travel machine ? No . Give me the matches . Give us some water . Like this ! You need to do this ! It 's yours now , smoke like this . Thank you . He says there they have a gravitsapa . Put your matches here . Listen to me . When you set us back on the Earth , you can have these both . What ? Come on , Skripach , let 's enter the cosmic space . Wait ! Give it back ! On mother Earth you 'll get them . Vladimir Nikolaevich ! You said if we take you , you will give us them all . But then you stole this match from us . Patsak doesn 't cheat patsak ! It 's not nice , my friend ... I said - take us to the town ! And what 's this ? A shed . And what 's this ? What 's this ? What 's this here - not a town ? ! Don 't fool with us . Show us your gravitsapa . If it 's a good brand , we 'll take it . Patsak ! Whom will I trade your smuggled ktse here , also in front of witnesses ? I 'll get etsikh with nails for my lifetime for this . Have you got a brain in your head or ' kyu ' ? We 'll buy it ourselves . Come on . Stop ! Stop I say ! Who are you ? I asked , who are you ? An alien foreman . No . You 're a patsak . And who are you ? I 'm a Georgian . No , You 're a patsak too . You 're a patsak , you 're a patsak and he 's a patsak . But I 'm chatlanian , and they are chatlanian . So you wear the tsak and sit in the pepelats , understand ? What ? Watch when I point a visator at myself , my friend ... what colour ? Green . Now at him , watch - green too . And at you ... green . Now look at Uef - which colour ? Orange ? Because he is Chatlanian ! Now you understand ? So what ? Pluke belongs to Chatlanians . Therefore we , Patsaks , must wear the tsak . Yes , and in front of Chatlanians you must do like this . Vladimir Nikolaevich , it 's unashamed racism . Show us again , please . Like this ! If you would , a little slower ... Like this . Vladimir Nikolaevich , your wife is at home , your son doing badly at school , you have to pay your mortgade you haven 't paid yet , and you 're here ... fooling around . It may have a bad end , my friend . Very well , Skripach , let 's play their games ... There we are , well done . Now give the match to Uef , so he buys a gravitsapa . He said he needed all of them . I was joking . Very funny . Wait . I come with you ... Don 't show them your ktse , and don 't think about it . Show them only my ktse . And don 't give more than half a match . Gravitsapa costs half a match . Your Patsak said , it costed the whole match . He was joking too . Grade 300 cement ? Patsak ! Remember - Half or less . Okay . Excuse me - Chatlanian and Patsak - is it nationality ? No . Biological factor ? No . From different planets ? No . So what distinguishes you from one another ? Are you colour blind , Skripach ? Green differs from orange , doesn 't it ? Tourist ! Wow ! Skyscraper ! Come on ! Do as I showed you . Hello , miss . It not too cold in that coat , eh ? They don 't want me . They want you alone . Don 't give them ktse , bring the gravitsapa here , and I 'll look at it . Go ... Not you ! We 're together ! Not you ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , tell him ! It 's alright . Wait here . Stay exactly here ! Hi ! How 's life ? You say , I shoul squat . Okey , out of respect for the ladies here . Well what 's new on Pluke ? Put here ktse , and you 'll get the gravitsapa . Half ? Half . Can I look at it ? Look . In general I am not a specialist on these gravitsapa , so let 's go and show it to my Chatlanian . He 'll examine it . Right . Let 's adjust the Tsapa . Sope throat ? Water ... I have a proposal . I 'll give you the rest of this ktse , and you give me two bottles of water . Agreed ? Let 's do it . Do you have any food ? Kasha ... What sort ? Plastic . So if I give you a whole ktse , you 'll give me five bottles of water and a kilo of kasha . What is it ? Ktse . We need to check it . Check it ! Oi , just a second ! Wait ... Skripach ! Can you obtain more matches on Earth ? I can . If you can spit this further , I 'll give you half a chatl . Like so ... spit . If I can , you give me two matches ... . Do you see ? No . It 's a simple game . I give you half a chatl , you give me three matches . Go ahead , spit , my son . Thank you , I 'd rather not . Well fine . You give me one match , and I give you three chatls , yellow trousers , and these odds . Go on ! No ! Blue trousers ... Mr. Uef , I will not play on any terms and conditions . Is it your latest word ? Why do you then fool around with me , maimoona verishvilo ? Mr. Uef ! I represent a civilized planet , and I demand that you attend your lexicon ! Where are they ? Who ? The one with a scar , I gave him all the matches , like an idiot . Quiet , my friends . Enough ! Enough ? What do you mean enough ? I told him a thousand times , we need to go to the centre . But he 's greedy , like all Chatlanians - ' it 's two chatls cheaper ! ' Well there 's still one . As I understand it , enough for a gravitsapa . Give it to me . Here . Why ? To buy a gravitsapa . Where ? There , in the centre . And how will you set us to mother Earth , when you don 't even know , in which galaxy it orbits ? Idiot , the number of your planet any planetarium in the centre will tell us for two chatls ! So you 'll give me the match ? So you can bury us in sand ? So you won 't give it ? No . Is it your latest word ? The very latest ! Then good-bye , my friend . They 're going , Vladimir Nikolaevich . They won 't go anywhere , they 'll hang themselves for a match . Either you give us that match , or we won 't set you to the Earth for less than 7 boxes ! Two thousand . Three . Two thousand three hundred . Three . Two thousand five hundred , I can 't give you more . You can , my friend . Mr Beeh , I have 50 rubles , matches cost 2 kopeks a box , that means I can buy two and a half thousand ... Skripach you 're lying ! You have more chatls . Mr. Uef ! I am not Skripach for you ! My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich ... What 's that , an engine ? Don 't poke your nose in every hole ! ... Gedevan Alexandrovich ... Gedevan , let 's tie up these lads now , and take a course to the North . Why ? Maybe the shores of the Mediterranean are there ? Ha , so Vladimir Nicolaevich , you 've gone out of your mind , my friend . Where on Pluke is there a sea ? They made luts from them long ago . Sorry , they made what ? Fuel , Skripach , fuel ... Now you owe us 6 140 boxes . How has it accumulated so much ? You ate the kasha , you drank the water ... and took the bandura . No , delete the bandura ... we don 't want the bandura . Put it down ... Let 's at least take something technical , if not who will believe it ? Now trade them the violin , if you like the bandura so much . It 's an 18th century Italian violin , it costs 1000 rubles , if not more . How will I pay for it ? Skripach , instead of constantly thinking that you 're the first Georgian cosmonaut , and that you 'll get a Nobel Prize for this , give back the spoon you stole from poor artists . I never thought of such a thing ... I wanted to send it to the Institute of Non-ferrous Metals , maybe it 's something new ... Heavens ! The heavens never saw such a disreputable Patsak as you , Skripach . I am deeply sad . Where are you going ? To the toilet . You can 't go to the toilet with money , money is left here . Gedevan Aleksandrovich . Ktse are very expensive , my friend . Why ? Well now , on Earth , how do you determine who should squat in front of whom and how many times ? Well , you just have a feel for it . Barbarians ! Listen , I 've started to like you , and I 'm teaching you . If I have a few ktse , I have the right to wear yellow trousers . And in front of me a Patsak should squat not one , but two times . If I have many ktse , I have the right to wear crimson trousers , and both a Patsak should squat twice in front of me , and a Chatlanian should say ' koo ' . And the Etsilopp don 't have the right to beat me at night . Never . I have a suggestion , my friend . You give us the match now , and we 'll give you yellow trousers after , okay ? Thanks , I have some already , perhaps Skripach needs them . Skripach ! Here are some interplanetary trousers for sale . Yellow ones . Do you want them ? Skripach isn 't here , my friend . Why not ? I ejected him . But you needn 't worry , Vladimir Nikolaevich - we have another ejector seat , a new one . I don 't understand ... I pressed the kappa - he flew . We don 't need Skripach , my friend , he only wastes extra fuel ... Turn around ! Not possible ... Luts is finished . We need to fly to the luts station . Turn around ! Or this damned match will burn now ! Gedevan ! Skripach ! Skripach ! What can have become of him ? You 've been told . The etsilopps have caught him . Well let 's fly , my friend . You 're bastards ! Get in touch with the etsilopps by radio ! But we don 't have a radio , we threw it out . I 'll take a look ... Etsilopp ! Put on the tsak , quick ... put on the tsak . Leave it ! Put it on , or he will trankluk you . You and the match . Good day . Listen , friend , we lost a young lad here , you haven 't come across him ? What ? Oh ! Sorry , I forgot ... They said you picked him up . I said we don 't need Skripach . I said it . Now how do we buy luts ? How ? You 're a bad disease , my friend ... He 's worse . He 's just a ' kyu ' . Here 's a suggestion . We find Skripach , and fly to the local government ... Bring a little sand , my friend ... We tell them who we are , where we 're from ... They 'll give us a gravitsapa , and we 'll organize some mutually beneficial trade : you give us yellow trousers and we give you as many ktse as you want . To fly to the government - we need to have a gravitsapa . The governors live on another planet , my friend . Uncle Vova ! I 'm here ! Here ... Skripach ! What ! And where is my thing , this ... Tsak ? Well ? I have it . So give it to me ! Why here ? Well , just give it to me , I said ! There 's no one here . That 's mine . Alright , then keep it ready . You asleep ? No . Don 't lose heart , Skripach . If there is a gravitsapa on this Pluke , we 'll get it . We 've got scarcer things ... Listen ! Eh ! Wait ! Listen , drop us off in the centre . Patsak ! Stop . What ? Don 't come any closer . Why do you want ? Take us to the centre ! ... Three chatls . No money ! But we 'll work for it ! And what can you do ? Me ? I can do everything ! And what exactly ? Vladimir Nikolaevich is a builder foreman , he can build you a house . And what can you do ? Me ? He can play the violin ! Play ... Play . I can 't ! See you around , Patsaks . Woman ! Wait ! I can play ! Play ! Here ? There ! Wait a minute . I 'll turn on the sound . Play . And sing . Wait , wait ! How does it go ... Mama , mama , what should I do ? ... Cool ! What ? I said , ' Cool ! ' These people like it . What ? These people like it ! Let me be a drummer . How ? Foreman ! We don 't need Skripach ! Don 't worry , he can be useful . Give us some water to drink , eh ? I said , after the performance . And we could take it by force . Then you 'd have to ask us . Oo ! Touch me - etselopp will come and pull off your legs . I don 't give a damn about your etsilopp ! Calm down , Skripach . Don 't provoke the lady ... Foreman ! Look ... .. Alright , I understand . Listen , do you know anyone with a gravitsapa and a pepelats ? Why ? Well he could drop us off on Earth , and we 'd give you a big box of ktse , and him ... I understand that your people don 't trust words , well read what I 'm thinking that your wife is phoning the morgues . No , what exactly now I 'm thinking . What you 're going to give us . Then it 's the truth . What idiot on Pluke thinks the truth ? Absurd ! So because you say what you don 't think and think what you don 't think , so you live in cages . All this bitter cataclysm which I see here , and Vladimir Nikolaevich sees too ... Patsaks have to perform in a cage , so we need a cage . Why show off ? Doesn 't matter , my dear , we will sing beside the cage . Get in the cage or he will see us , and will trankluk you . We 're not animals . What ? No you will come inside ! Come inside ! Let go ! You will get in ! Wait ! Get in ! Get in , or he will melt us ! Okay , get in Skripach . If she wants it that badly . Get in . One two three ... Dance ! Dance ... You know , try to find another ensemble ... my friend . What ? I 'll be back . We 've got to get out of here . Boys , push the cart , it 's uphill . The pleasure is ours ... Gas ! See you , bastards ! I will tell everybody where this buffoon PZh has led the planet . Patsaks have walked all over Chatlanians ! Well , everything there ? She stole the eau de cologne . Women ! ... Hang on , is that lead you got there ? Let me , uncle Vova . I don 't even know which way to look . Where 's the Earth ? Galina Borisovna ! Comrade Mashkov and I , as patsaks , could receive two chatls for a performance - it 's the maximum . Water , luts and fines for epsilopps - a minimum of one chatl a day . And a gravitsapa costs half a ktse ! That 's 2200 chatls . Divided by 365 , take off Saturday and Sunday we get 6 . And that 's for those 6 years when I had no way of returning ! That 's all very well , Gedevan Alexandrovich , but these are just words . Where is the proof , that you arrived from the space , and didn 't sell the violin , as Prof. Rogozin alleges , and spent all this time in a discotheque in Gagri ? Here 's some rock . Here 's a chatl . Here 's a tsak . And a nut and sand I attached to the explanation report and handed in to Dean 's secretary Raechka , so that it could be sent to UNESCO . Where ? UNESCO . You are a grown man , Gedevan Alexandrovich . You study for one term and disappear for years ! And explain yourself ... with some pebble , some piece of old Caucas ceramics , and a fishing bell ! And you pretend to be ... well , as to that , if you have musical talent , then why didn 't you participate in our amateur performers course ? You will excuse me , Skripach , but it 's elementary koo ! End of part One . Part Two Short Chatlo-patsak dictionary . Ktse - matches Tsak - Little bell for the nose . Etsikh - Box for prisoners . Etsilopp - Member of the Police . Pepelats - Interplanetary ship . Gravitsapa - Component of Pepelats motor Kyu - Oath permissible in company . Koo - All other words . Hi ! Hello . Long time no see ! Bye ! Oi ! Hang on a sec ! I 've got a proposal ! What ? What do we think of you ? Well ? Read our minds . Why do you stick to us ? What do you need ? Do you have no shame ? Do you ? We are poor , unfortunate , hungry artists ! What wrong have we done you ? Why do you torment us ? Give your bandura here ... Tune up ... Like so . Come on . One two three . Mama , mama , what shall I do ? Mama , mama , How will I live ? I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have a warm vest . Shut it ! You 're tone deaf ! Mama , mama , what shall I do ? Mama , mama , How will I live ? Uncle Vova , let 's do it again ! They like it ... They understand . One two ... Etsilopp ! Artists ! And where is our tub ? The pepelats ? Yes . There ... The fuel is finished . Because of you , pests . Skripach ! What are you doing ? Hooligan ! Listen , leave me in peace , okay ? My friend , it 's somebody 's last breath , a grave ... Checkmate ! You said you were ' second class ' . He 's a braggart ! Cheat ! You won by reading my thoughts . If you had a brain , you 'd be studying in MGIMO , And not here pissing everybody off . Want to play again ? For your violin , case and tooth stick ... And this ! Okay ? Okay ! From you the bandura , the visator ... and the mojo of Mr. Uef . Agreed . Let 's do it ! Uncle Vova ... You need to screw the tsapa in . Alright - you do it ! I 'm not allowed , I 'm a Chatlanian . Sod off ! When it comes to advice , you 're all Chatlanians , When it comes to work , though ... Fool 's mate . Cheat ! You purposely thought bad moves for me ! Use your own brain for the game ! How can he use his own brain , when he 's just seen these dolls for the first time ? That 's not my problem . Give me my winnings . No way ! Uef , did you ever see such a mercenary little patsak-kyu ? Never . I told you we don 't need Skripach , and here 's the result . Hey ! Boss ! ... You said tsapa ! Is it true nobody sings in cages on the Earth ? Mr. Beeh , on the Earth we only have animals in cages . Are those animals Chatlanians ? I don 't know . They act like it ... Is nightingale a Patsak ? Why a Patsak ? You said it sings without a cage . Well then he 's a Patsak . Ah ! So you see , you have the same open racism as here on Pluke . Only the Patsaks have taken power , not the Chatlanians , just like you and your friend the Nightingale ! Let me ... You can have four gulps . The water 's for the youngster . You owe us 6042 boxes now . Skripach , make a note . I already have . Do you want some ? No . It 's free . Hey ! What are you doing ? And me ? And me ? I 'll give you ten boxes more , take some water for yourself ... God , Kin-dza-dza ! A ship ! It 's not a ship . It 's a luts-station . So we can refuel ! We can 't ! This one 's automatic , but with a woman attendant . If we perform , she 'll give us a discount , understand ? Don 't hesitate , Uncle Vova . Come on , come on , my friend ... Come on ... If this was once sea , why are there no sea shells ? On the Earth you still have seas ? We have seas , and rivers , and honest people too , Mr. Uef . Savages . You make me want to cry . Mama , mama , what shall I do , Mama , mama , how shall I live , I don 't have a warm coat , I don 't have a warm vest . It 's a pity my boss can 't see me now , He 'd probably give me a raise . Keep quiet , Uncle Vova . She 's watching us . They took the woman out and installed a machine . So take enough for the money you have . At least we 'll fly some way ! You can 't buy luts in parts . Luts costs 10 chatls per load , and we only have 7 . How far from here to the centre ? 160 km . Uncle Vova , Uef has more chatls , in the right shoe ... Oi , Chatlanian ! What ? Can you take your right boot off for us ? Why ? Kyu , bastard ! All of you ! Squat ! Why ? They 're not epsilopps are they ? It 's PJ with his Patsak . If they find out that you didn 't squat , It 's life in etsikh laying on nails . Who 's he ? You see that ? Yeah , it 's a hologram , my friend . The violin ! Quiet ! Stand still ! Stand still ! And you say koo . It 's not a balloon , you idiot ! It 's the last breath of Mr. PJ . Bollocks . How could one person breath so much just before he died ? Absurd . Don 't blaspheme . PJ is alive ! And I am happy . I 'm happier still . Like this . Come on , get inside . Plastic . No . Is there a normal entrance to this supermarket ? Normal entrance you have to pay chatls for , my friend . Get on with it ! Skripach ! Patsaks go there ! What are they doing ? This is the fourth pump of Mr. PJ . I love PJ very much . I ' koo ' him even more ! And here they make water from luts . What are they shouting ? Sell . Sell what ? Sell everything . So we 'll take a gravitsapa ! Gravitsapas are another department . First we need to find out the tenture of the Earth . Yellow Trousers ... two times ' koo ' . Think ! What 's the diameter of you planet 's orbit ? I don 't remember ... Skripach do you know ? No , we don 't need Skripach . You ! All right . The specific gravity of the core of your planet . Think . Specific gravity ? No , I can 't remember ... I see . The names of the planets in your galaxy . Which ones do you know ? Think . Jupiter , Mars , Venus ... There was a crystal display ! Where is the crystal display ? Skripach ! Put it back in its place ! I thought as it was lying there it was a piece of glass ... Stupid idiot . Enough . Stop your brains squeaking , fool . Here 's the number of your planet : 013 in the tenture . On the left of the Great Bear . Do you want to talk with the Earth ? It 'll cost you another chatl . I don 't understand ? Think of your own telephone number ! And ask them about matches . ... Hello ! Hello ! Can you hear me ? Speak here ... Hello ! Hello ! I 'm listening , go ahead ! Hello ! Speak ! It 's timed ! Hello ! Lusya ! Vova ! Can you hear me ? It 's me ! Vova , where are you ? Well , I 'm here ... How are you ? You ... How 's Cyril ? Where are you , Vo ... Where are you , Vova ? I 'm here , in some place , I 'll explain everything later . How 's mum feeling ? Have you been to see her ? I have been ... I asked you where you were ! Listen , Patsak woman ! Stop fooling around ! Run and buy two wooden boxes of ktse ! Or we 'll find another woman for him ! Sod off ! Lusya ! Dear Lusya ... Lusya . My darling ... Lusya ... Lusya ! Take the phone , right now , and call Victor Manohin tell him that the plumbing keys are in my cabin , under the thingy ... under the cupboard . Lying on the floor . Did you get all that ? Yes , I got it ... Put me through to Batumi , 3-47-57 , please . Tell them to fetch Alec . No , I won 't . Piss off you bloody thief . Is something wrong ? It 's alright , only the Earth is so far way . Instead of five , the gravitsapa will need seven minutes to warm up . So let 's go and get the tsapa ready for the gravitsapa . Astronauts ! Which is the tsapa here ? This rusty nail , my friend . Yeah ! Everything here 's rusty ! And that 's the most rusty . Are you quite crazy ? Oh , mama-mama ! Lusya and Manokhin are here ! Surprise ... Uncle Vova ! The match is in his cap ! Strange , that they should fly off now . Why strange ? They 've got a match , can buy a gravitsapa , and know the Tenture of the Earth ! Comrade Etsilopp ! Comrade Etsilopp ! They 've stolen our things ! Arrest them ! Arrest them ! Forty Chatls . We 've no chatls . Everything is with the tour guide . And the violin they took is somebody else 's . And when they were in front of the video of PJ , They didn 't say Koo ! Why are you staring at me ? Why are you staring at me ? If your bosses find out that you knew of this and did nothing , You 'll be bloody trankluted ! Get it ? I didn 't do nothing ! I pressed the kappa straight away ! Skripach is a witness . All guards ! Bring a wheeled prison tub , here There 's nothing in it . Open it . Show him . It 's vinegar . It 's none of your business . The Patsak will be tranklukated , The Chatlanian will spend his life in etsikh lying on nails . Oh , brothers , brothers . Fellow Patsaks . Tell the truth , how I squatted . How the Chatlanian pressed the kappa . Shut the fuck up ! Uncle Vova , please ... Shut up ! Parasite ! Shut up yourself ! Vova , friend ! Gedevan Alexanich ! Don 't listen to him ! Tell them that it was him ! He didn 't squat ! No ... And I 'll give the pepelats to you . Uncle Vova ! The pepelats is mine ! Mine ! Quiet ! Calm down ! ... Let me think . Nobody insulted anyone ... They all squatted , like monkeys . I was confused . And I brought the Ktse . What Ktse ? The match , which you took out ... from the hat . There wasn 't a match . There wasn 't . Uncle Vova , what 's the matter with you ? Forgive me , I forgot . There was no match . No match . Life imprisonment for both in etsikh without nails . Until the fine is paid . 500 chatls , 250 per head . Thank you ! Patsak ! Glue the violin and sing songs ! Skripach ! You work the bandura ! Friends ! With the match it was a joke . We wanted to make you happy ! Bye ! On the river , on the river , on yonder bank ... Earthman , hello ! I am sure one day you 'll reach also this planet . Greetings from Vladimir Nikolaevich Mashkov , builder from Moscow , and Gedevan Alexidse from Batumi , who are the first to set foot on these villainous sands established in this Universe backyard . Brother Patsak , put some more of your plastic . You have some water there . Well , give me something for it . It might be so that someone who knows me is still living on Earth . Tell them , I did not mean to steal the violin . There ! Looks like new ! There 's still a little bit . It happens ... All a in lifetime . High calorie ? Earthmen ! How could you be so careless ? I could hardly find you . I got my memory back . Here 's your sock , thank you . If you want , I can return you to the Earth . I found out your number in the tenture . Only hurry ! For one second here is half a year there . Then I have a suggestion ... We transport to the Earth now , Buy some matches , Shoot back here and sell them , Bail out our friends , We go to Moscow , and you go home . I can 't . I 've only three charges . Well that 's okay . Enough times to go there back here and home again . And me ? Listen , friend ... Well work it out , yes or no , I 'll count to three ... One ... Two ... Wait a minute . Take my suggestion . It 's my fault they are in prison . And my little son has already grown an adult 's beard ! Two and a half ! Two and a half ! I ... I can 't do it . Three . Oh ! Who needs it all ? Tsak-schmak ! It 's all crap ! And we ... Where did you get that from ? Eh ? It was laying on a shelf in the planetarium ... Skripach ! You dear kleptomaniac ! You brought us a gravitsapa ! Patsaks ! Patsaks ! Why are you standing performing here ? Standing is allowed only there . The Etsilopps won 't allow us . You can only kneel here . So what if we 're here ... You 've still got to pay us . Alright , come on ... Come on , obey the rules . Uncle Vova , your jacket is coming , and my hat . Hi ! How are things ? Anything new happened ... on Pluke ? Sing ! We seem to be out of voice today . Sing ! Vladimir Nikolaevich , I can 't do any more ... Don 't worry , Skripach . How much is that ? One hundred . Seems like we 've sung enough . And what 's that there ? Fifty . Etsilopp ! Patsaks ! Why aren 't you wearing muzzles ? Turn round ! Orders of Mr. PJ - all Patsaks to wear muzzles ... and be glad . So , that 's for me and that 's for you . And that 's for you . Why aren 't you glad ? I demand to know . Pick up your own gun , Chatlanian . Put them on , then ... I 'm doing it ... I 'm glad . Ho ho . Oh look , PJ 's coming ! Where ? Get up ! Get up ! Open your mouth ! Wider ! Skripach , gag ! Quickly ! Turn round ! Nose ! Give me the money ! Okay ... Make sure they stay there , like so ... And you can get rid of these ! If you think , that this junk won 't tranklucate you , it 'll be the last though in your Chatlanian head ! Show us the shortest way to the etsikh area , quick march ! Everyone lay down for half an hour ! Forwards ! Forwards ! Quickly ! Excuse me Grandma ... PJ 's mom . Did you see it ? It 's him . Everyone quickly now ... in the pool ! Open the door . And stay there for 24 hours ! Do you Koo or not ? Here ... What number ? The last one . Hello ... Hey , Chatlanian ! Sing ! Finish , Skripach ... Wheel out the last but one . Vanish ! Hello , Gedevan Alexandrovich . Gamarjoba ... Get out . I can 't . They 'll catch us . Stop ! We have a gravitsapa . Koo , uncle Vova ! Cut it . Right here . Throw your weight on it ! Uncle Vova ! Help me roll the etsikh out ! Leave it ! Vladimir Nikolaevich ! Because of one stone from the moon mankind wasted a thousand years , and here 's a living alien , and an etsikh made of an unknown metal . Leave it , I said ! Tsapa . Yes , sir ! Tsapa . Tsapa ! Push the tstapa . I 've pushed . So are we flying ? Taking off . Brothers ! Be quick ! They 're after us now ! Don 't interfere . She 's landed . Where ? Hanut . And what 's Hanut ? The planet I was born on . And me . Night . It 's always night here , now . Time to put this on . Why ? There 's no bloody air . So how do you live here ? Nobody 's lived here for years . Guys from Pluke tranklucked everyone , while we were on the tour . Why ? Because we didn 't have time to do them first . And why would you want to do them ? So that they weren 't hanging over our heads . And everybody perished ? Of course . Vova , I 've a suggestion . The planet Hanut is only worth kopeks now . 63 chatls . We go and sing ' Mama ' around the galaxy for a month , then the planet is ours . And another month - we can buy air . 93 chatls . Guys from places with no air will jump into here . The air will be ours . They 'll be crawling around , and we 'll be spitting on them . Why ? For fun ! Where 's the fun in that ? You 're too young to know ... Half the planet 's yours , half ours . Okay ? Tempting , of course ... But we need the Earth , guys . We have to hurry . The supermarket closes in half an hour . Vova , you don 't ... Just look . We 're here . And there 's the Earth . And here 's Alpha . They make cactuses from us on Alpha . Earth 's in the anti-tenture , my friend . And there 's no way that we can reach it , understand ? How 's that so ? Just is . I always had bad luck . It 's not possible for a pepelats to get to Earth . Enough of this bollocks ! Is it clear ? Let 's divide the planet up . You found this out in the planetarium ? Yes , my friend . ... therefore you stole a match ? Of course . They 're lying , uncle Vova . Don 't believe them . Now , take us to the Earth , that 's all ! No , Gedevan , they 're not lying . They 'd crawl across the whole Universe for these matches ... Vova ! You shouldn 't joke like that ... The oxygen here is two percent of normal . Gedevan ... You don 't need this . You 're young , you live a long time . Maybe things will change ... We don 't need Skripach , uncle Vova . Hey , Patsak ! You 'll be dead very soon anyway . Tell the truth for once in your life . Why didn 't you go with that idiot when you could ? What did you want ? Crimson Trousers ? PJ 's bathhouse ? Tell me ! Gedevan , shvilo , tell me please . Trust me , we 're friends . I have a Georgian mother . Had . He says she is a local Georgian . Was . Uef ! I don 't care what you think , I 'll ' koo ' them to Alpha . And you , scabby Chatlanian , wear the tsak ! And " faire la rå 'vå 'rence " when you speak to a Patsak ! Hanut is the Patsak planet , my friend . Repeat it again . You eject us on Alpha , and try to brake in its orbit , and then ... There 's no chance to brake there ... Don 't interrupt ! Go on , my friend . On Alpha , when they transfer us to the Earth , we need to keep our fingers on the back of the space travel machine so that it stays with us . On Earth we must buy you four wooden boxes of matches . Go on , friend . How many times should we repeat it ... Let 's go , if we can . Because of you I 'll be locked up in a flowerpot forever ! And you don 't want just to repeat it for us . Brothers ! Dear , good , friend of mine ... Let 's fly , or at least close this door . I can 't stand looking at you any more , I feel sick anyway . Farewell , my friend . We 're flying . Brake ! Brake ! Brake ! How can I brake when you drank all the brake fluid ? Alcoholic ! He 'll be sick . Switch off your antlers ! They won 't switch off . Then take them off . They 'll break then . It seems to have landed . Just like last time . Put on your gas mask . And the tsak ? No , we can do without it . Earth ! On the river , on the river , on those banks ... No ... not the Earth . Hello ! We 're Patsaks from the planet Earth . And you are ? This is the planet Alpha . Report your co-ordinates to Deacont , and she will transfer you to your point of departure . Good luck ! The number of your planet , if you 'd be so good . 013 in the tenture . Here it is ... Somewhere here straight ahead . There . To the left of the Great Bear . That 's not necessary . If you would , hold hands . Woman , what are you going to do with these ? Into the Little Greenhouse . Please . Hold hands ! Do you really turn people into cacti ? Only out of Plukeeanians . Oh , but they 're not Plukeeanians . They 're Hanutians . That is irrelevant . Please put on the breathing masks . Why , your air is really nice . That is precisely why . God , just look at her . Ok , Gedevan . Calm down . Put it on . In the name of the planet , I 'm asking you to let them go . Who decides their fate ? Abrodox . But ... Take us to him . Otherwise I 'll take off my mask and start breathing . You shouldn 't worry . Our greenhouses are very comfortable . Blossoming , micro-climate , serenity . One could be jealous of it . Then why are you running around on the grass , and not inside in a pot ? Please look where you are going , you 've already squashed three little plants . Friend ! We have a big favor to ask you . You can 't continue . No . Our misfortune is the neighborhood of the galaxy Kin-Dza-Dza . They are consumed with fury and depravity . To continue their lives in the form of plants would be a blessing for them . And for everyone else . Can we ask themselves what would be a blessing for them and what not ? Well if we were to give them the possibility to decide anything , then ... Young lady , are you the most intelligent ones here ? Did anyone tell you this or you decided it by yourself ? We can 't waste time with this . You are creatures of the anti-tenture , and I must send you to your point of departure . Or return you in time , to the moment when you made your fateful decision . Choose . Excuse me . I don 't understand . To what time ? The past ... to Pluke . Can you send one of us to Earth , and the other to the past ? Vladimir Nikolaevich , I won 't allow you on Pluke alone . Listen , uncle , set it for the past . What did it take , 50 minutes to glue the violin ? 50 minutes . Brother Patsak , there is a guy coming with the sock . Tell him to go to the etsikh area . Do you know where it is ? I know . Go on then , show us . Let 's give them something else to do . Everyone rest for half an hour ! Thank you , my friend . Play , play , peasants . Skripach ! Time ! Once again you haven 't transferred , bastards . Again . Get out . Bollocks . It 's better for us here than on Alpha . Come on , drag them out . Quickly , we 'll soon have the space travel machine . Vladimir Nikoleavich ! You owe us 11 000 boxes , as Skripach has noted . 11 020 ! I have a suggestion . Vova ! We 'll transfer with you to a supermarket now , and after you 've bought them all ... There won 't be any ' after ' . We can only go to the Earth . Forever ? Forever . Me on a planet where they don 't even know who should squat in front of whom ? Bullshit . Take the gravitsapa and do what you want . Uncle Uef . Uncle Beeh . You will have a great reception there ! No , genatsvale ! When a society has no colored trousers to differentiate classes , then there is no goal . And if there is no goal ... Brothers . Enough philosophyzing . He 's almost here . Now , decide . With us or not ? Give us the gravitsapa , alright ? Give it to him . You 'll regret it . Well , let 's say good-bye ... I got used to you , you know . Me too . Well , take care . Friends , Patsaks ! Here 's your sock , thank you . If you want ... Friend ! What is your travel system ? Let me have a look . An ordinary system . Press the button and go home . Hi Hi - what 's new ? Manohin had a pipe burst at the factory . How 's the star schoolboy ? He 's out playing ... Vova , pop out for some bread . I forgot it , can you ? And I think , there is not enough macaroni . Comrade ... How do I get to the Stary Arbat ? That way , to the right . Thank you . ... Skripach ? Uncle Vova ? ... Skripach ! Uncle Vova ! Mama , mama , what shall I do ? The End

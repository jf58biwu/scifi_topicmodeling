 A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . You killed a 19-year-old girl - that your nephew loved . - I had to ! I need to get a message to someone on the inside . Why don 't you write down what you wanna say , where you wanna send it ? " So get the egg and bring it with you . " Oh , my God . He did change it . - Do you believe me ? - What 's my dad want with the egg ? - No one can know about Barbie . - You 're worried about Big Jim . Without Barbie , no telling what he 'll do . - Barbie sent you another e-mail . - He 's alive . - So you 're gonna jump ? - He doesn 't want me to . - Don 't jump ! - Leave him alone ! Barbie ! - Where am I ? - Relax . You 're perfectly safe . As long as you talk . Well , I 'm happy to , with my one phone call . We 're not the police . Or the military . Got black uniforms , no insignias , no flag of origin . That 's a violation of the Geneva convention . Says the man who was caught trespassing in a restricted security zone with false credentials . Okay , so charge me or let me go . National Defense Authorization Act says I don 't have to charge you or release you . I 'm not a terrorist . Prove it . Tell me why you went to the dome last night . Go to hell . We 've had our eye on you . Dale Barbara , Special Forces . So you know it all . What else you need from me ? How 'd you get out of Chester 's Mill ? I want the exact route . " Don 't jump , " you said . Why did you tell that woman , Julia Shumway , not to jump ? Why do you care how or why I got out ? Because you 're so gung-ho to save everyone on the inside ? What the hell have you done to help any of us ? You 're going to cooperate . Including getting Miss Shumway to hand over that power source . So this is about that . You admit you know what it is . Yeah . I just think that you want something you 're never gonna get . Hold that thought , smart guy . - Good morning , Julia . - Hey , Jim . Enjoying your first day as sheriff ? Oh , yeah . Having a blast . Never short of trouble these days . Speaking of which , I was driving by and I noticed that you got some company again out there . Haven 't seen guards this close in weeks . Any idea what they 're doing there ? No . So you haven 't seen anything odd lately outside the dome ? I 'm as stumped as you are . Well , if you do see anything unusual , just give me a call on that walkie I gave you . Must be hard getting a sense of closure . What do you mean ? I mean not getting a chance to bury Barbie . When my wife died , the accident was severe . There was no viewing . It was a closed casket . Anyway , what I 'm trying to say is if you want me to organize a team to help recover the body , it 'll give you a chance to say goodbye . Well , that 's kind of you , but I wouldn 't wanna put anyone else in danger . That 's what Barbie was doing for Sam and look how that turned out . If you change your mind , give the sheriff a holler . Will do . Do you think he knows ? About Barbie being alive ? He was asking a lot of questions . Exactly why we have to keep this to ourselves until we know he 's okay . - He might send another e-mail . - Doubt they 'll let him . Maybe the guys who took Barbie are the same ones who want the egg . How would they know about it ? Question is what would they do if they got a hold of it ? Well , you wouldn 't give the egg to them . We 'll protect it . Right ? Until I know Barbie 's safe , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . Let 's get to the school on the chance he does get another e-mail through . That 's a good idea . Listen , I 'm gonna head back to the station and keep an eye on my dad . Why red ? Why a door ? You know , in the Old Testament , Israelites would paint their doors red with blood of lambs as a symbol of sacrifice so the angel of vengeance would pass them by . You 're just full of happy stories , aren 't you ? Sam , give him a break . Art theory 101 , a door always symbolizes a way in somewhere . Hey , look . The locker . Right ? In the school ? I went through that to get out of Chester 's Mill . So this door could be a way back in , wherever it is . When I went off the cliff , I woke up in some kids ' playground . That 's exactly what happened to me . Did you see a red door at the playground ? Didn 't notice . So if this door does lead to Chester 's Mill , it could be a way for me to get Junior and bring him here . - Think you can bring Jim back too ? - I can 't think about that right now . Let 's go to the playground and see if there 's a red door there . - Where you been , James ? - Just making rounds . See all that activity outside the dome ? The fellas in black ? Yeah , I did . I saw someone else too last night . On the other side . - Who ? - Barbie . He 's alive . Did you know ? Yeah , Dad . I did . Well , thank you for being honest with me , son . Now , I need you to keep being honest with me . There 's something I want you to show me . You got two minutes . Dale , are you okay ? You mean aside from the bracelets and luxury accommodations ? - How did you get in here ? - I pulled every string I have . So then pull a few more and get me out . Dale , I run an energy company . The friends I have sit in offices in D.C. These other people , they 're something else . But you don 't know who . After the failed missile strike on the dome a couple weeks ago , they caught hell from Congress , the media . Just trying to distance themselves from the situation so they hired private contractors . Kind of how government hired you to handle all communication in the dome . So tell me , who changed my message to Julia ? Was that you or was that them ? I tried to get it through , but they caught me and they strong-armed me . In order to send your message to Julia , they insisted that we add the bit about the egg . Dad , stop , all right ? Enough . No more lies . Son , I want you out of those cuffs . The only way there 's a chance of that happening is you have to convince Julia to bring the egg . It 's the only thing that 's valuable enough to trade for your release . I can 't help you . Still so damn stubborn . I just hope it doesn 't end up getting us both killed . Time 's up . You tried , sir . And you 're not trying hard enough . What 's the point of owning a security firm if it can 't secure a damn thing ? It won 't be long before the military does find out about the power source . So by any means necessary ? Whatever it takes . Looks like there 's no end to it . This is how Barbie got out , huh ? Hard to believe . You can 't explain it , Dad . You just have to accept it . Take it on faith . What ? Everything your mother said before she died . Everything I thought was so crazy . Maybe it 's all starting to make sense now . - And you never believed her . - Well , I couldn 't . Till now . With all this staring me in the face . I just wish I could apologize for doubting her . I guess we 'd both give anything to see her again , huh ? Yesterday , you said the dome chose you , that it had a plan for you . This is it . It 's my job to lead the people of this town to freedom . - You said Barbie jumped here , right ? - Yeah . But last night outside the dome , when he saw Julia , he told her not to jump . - Say what ? - No . She thinks that the guys who dragged him off want the egg . The egg ? - I thought she got rid of that thing . - She tried to . The thing kind of has a mind of its own . And you all think it powers the dome . - That 's the working theory , right ? - Yeah . I bet that 's why those guards are back . Where is it now ? I don 't know . Well , as the only two lawmen left in this town , we 'd better track it down . Every day of the third grade , James would beg me to take him to the playground after school . Turns out there was this little blond there . Angie McAlister . He was infatuated with her . One day , he was showing off , he got in a tire swing like that one . And he wound it tight and he was spinning . - There 's a red door . - We 're not alone . I 'll try drawing off the one with the tablet . You take the other one . Meet me back at the stone structure in the park when you lose them . No grown-ups . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - We need to send another message . Into the dome ? I thought you said it was too conspicuous . I thought you understood you do what I say . Or your next stop will be whatever dark hole the feds throw punks who commit corporate espionage . Yes , sir . - Should we meet back at the office ? - My computer has a remote interface . Do it from here . Now . How long do we have to do this for ? There 's not even a signal . Just these old e-mails . As long as Julia wants us to . What if something bad 's happened to Barbie ? - Joe , don 't say that . - I mean , maybe we should jump . After all , he got out . Last night , he said it 's not safe out there . Do we just stay here forever , then ? At some point , not safe out there might be better than not safe in here . - Anything ? - Not yet . Look . " Hounds of Diana . " Someone with that weird name posted on my Twitter . Open that e-mail . Hey , we just got a new e-mail . It 's strange . Before , when the Wi-Fi signal was live , a few e-mails came through . Makes me think whoever 's sending is controlling the signal . Open it . No text . It 's just a video link for you from Aktaion Energy . Julia , my name 's Don Barbara . I 'm Dale 's father . I think you know him as Barbie . - I know that voice . - I 'm sure you 're concerned about him . He 's currently in custody and true to his nature , he 's not cooperating . Now , I don 't mean to be curt , but we don 't have much time . The people who are holding him , they want the power source that you 've discovered . I understand you call it the egg ? They wanna study it , understand it . It might even hold the key to getting all of you out from under there . It 's the only thing I know I can trade for Dale 's release . If you don 't , I ... I don 't know what they may do to him . So please , hurry . It 's an unfortunate way to meet the woman who means so much to my son . Julia . Julia . Yeah ? What are you gonna do ? So how about we pick things up where we left off ? And Daddy 's not here to protect you anymore . It 's not really a fair fight . Yeah . Those are overrated . - So ... - Oh , God . You 're gonna get Miss Shumway to deliver the egg to us . Yeah . Just as long ... Can 't hear you , Barbara . As you kiss my ass . When were you gonna tell me ? I 've never liked fishing , Jim . - About Barbie . - What about Barbie ? I saw him last night outside the dome . Barbie 's alive ? Oh , you telling me Julia didn 't tell you ? As closely as you 've been working together ? Jim , I had no idea . - So she lied to you too ? - No . If there was a way out , Julia wouldn 't keep it from the town . She would to save Barbie . The guards caught him and dragged him off . Someone out there is playing hardball to get this egg . What egg ? You really are in the dark here , aren 't you ? It 's some kind of energy source . The kids say it generates the dome . They 've been protecting it with Julia . I thought you could locate this thing , you know ? Build an egg detector or something , you know ? As a scientist . Figure it out . I think there 's a way to find it that 's more reliable than copper wire and duct tape . - Joe . - No . No , no . - No , he 's part of the problem . - He trusts me . I can poke around . He might let us in on their secret . All right , good . See if you can get him to show you where this thing is . - What are you doing ? - Oh , thank God . - Did you lose the guy ? - Yeah , I guess . I mean , for now . That red door lead anywhere ? The playground may be the way in , it is not the way out . Pauline , what are you doing ? It 's starting , Lyle . This is how my visions start . - In mud ? - Cloud shapes . I see symbols everywhere I turn , anything . And now , it 's in the form of a spiral . - What 's that mean ? - I don 't know . Maybe something bad about going to Chester 's Mill . Well , I thought that was your idea . I 'm not saying we shouldn 't go . We have to . There 's just something about this spiral . I don 't know . It scares me . No , you don 't need to be afraid . Pauline , we 're together . - Lyle , honestly , I have to ... - Never mind . Forget I said it . Hey , did you find anything ? - No , dead end . - We should keep moving . Those guys ID 'd us and I don 't think it 's safe to go back to your apartment . I know a safe place we can stay . Who knows who any of these people are ? We can 't just give them the egg . Barbie 's life could be at stake . But he told you it 's not safe out there . - Since when do you have a vote ? - Don 't you wanna get out ? If we give them the egg , then we can all escape . I could see my parents again . Please , Julia . You always said that the dome is here to protect us . - It didn 't protect my mom . - Or my sister . Melanie , I know what I said . But maybe the cliffs , the tunnels , they 're all the dome 's way of telling us something new . That we need to leave or send the egg over . No . I died once for the egg and then it brought me back . I don 't know why , but I feel in my heart that we have to keep it with us . Okay , so your feeling 's more important than keeping Barbie alive and getting us out of this awful place ? You don 't know what you 're talking about . Melanie . - What are you doing here ? - I know . Barbie 's alive . The egg . Everything you 've been keeping from me . Well , eavesdropping will do that . Actually , Big Jim told me . - He knows ? - And he wants the egg . No , Jim having it would be a disaster . Which is why I came to warn you . He sent me to find out where it is and report back , but I can 't do that . Julia , I know you don 't trust me . It 's probably with good reason , but the truth is , I 'm like you . I just wanna save the town . So you can waste time trying to make your mind up about me , or you can accept my help . Either way , things are going to get worse around here . Hunter , got some visitors for you . Pauline . I was kind of surprised to get your call . We just need a safe place to stay . Are you okay ? I haven 't talked to you in a week . I was starting to get worried . I 've been lying low myself . A lot of developments with the dome . Uh , you wanna fill us in ? This is Hunter . He was my best student when I taught art at Zenith High . And this other computer gentleman ? Trevor . Another of the Hounds of Diana . Website 's kind of an underground news source for everything the government doesn 't want people to know . Hunter , we got an incoming . Is that one of the guys from playground ? - Is there a back door ? - Only the front one . It 's okay , Trevor . It 's kind of his way of saying hello . What the hell ? Did you get to the dome yesterday ? - Oh , you son of a bitch . - Stop . - Who are you ? - She 's a friend of mine . Pauline Verdreaux . Pauline Rennie ? - What do you want with my brother ? - It 's okay , Barbie . I would 've run a while ago if I was going to . That doesn 't make you any less guilty . - Guilty of what ? - Your brother 's a murderer . He killed Angie McAlister . That 's Angie 's place . I know exactly where that 's at . Did you kill Angie ? Your journal made it seem like those four kids were somehow making it happen . Angie , her brother Joe , Norrie and Junior . Tell me you did not touch a hair on his head . Of course not , Pauline . Oh , my God . - What ? - That 's why we have to go there . Don 't you see ? You killed that girl because of what I drew . We have to go to Chester 's Mill to atone for our sins or we will never find peace , no matter where we run to . You look a little banged up , Mr. Barbara . You rub somebody the wrong way ? You might say that . - What is that for ? - Hey , relax . This isn 't for your brother . - Not yet . - I 'm not running , Barbie . I 'm going back to Chester 's Mill . We all are . - What ? - I have to get James out . Oh , is that right ? Well , I gotta get everyone out . Question is , how do you even get back in ? Pauline did another drawing . It may be a way back in . No , I 'm sorry . These drawings have led to some pretty awful stuff . It doesn 't change the fact my sister 's drawings have always been right . We won 't have to go far . An image search found possibilities in town . I 've got all the red doors here in Zenith . Personally , I 'm thinking the storage space , if we 're digging into the space-time of it all the colonial 's got that whole Narnia spin . You said that you saw this in a vision ? They always mean something . That door is the way back into the dome . Hunter , we need addresses . No , you don 't . I know where this is . I grew up there . Junior , where are you taking it ? I can 't keep the egg at Angie 's apartment anymore . It 's not safe . What do you mean ? I told my dad about it . - Why ? - I don 't know . He 's done a lot of good for Chester 's Mill . The moment I told him about it ... You knew you shouldn 't have ? I know a lot of people don 't trust him , I 'm still trying to believe in him . As messed up as it all is , I still think he was a good father once . I understand , but not all fathers can be who you want them to be . What are you doing here , Melanie ? Your dad 's not the only one with a reason to take the egg . I 've had faith in Julia this whole time . I still try to have it , but I don 't know anymore . I think her priorities have shifted . Barbie is more important to her now . So she 's gonna trade the egg for him ? Isn 't that what you would do for the people you love ? Things that seem reckless to everyone else ? Not everyone gets that . Not everyone 's been in love . Do you wanna protect it with me from now on ? I know a place where we can keep it safe . - What did you do with it ? - Do with what ? I went to Angie 's apartment , and now the egg is gone . I think you knew it was there . Looks like we both got skunked . Come on . You know me well enough by now to tell when I 'm lying . Because the exception is so rare . Well , I can 't really get mad at Rebecca for flapping her lips at you . Everybody wants that damn thing . But I 'm trying to protect the town , not just Barbie . Barbie ? What does he have to do with this ? We both know Barbie 's alive . Those men have him , and you were gonna give them that egg to set him free . It 's a pretty big risk . Well , I don 't expect you to understand . Big Jim Rennie doesn 't know what it 's like to love anyone other than himself . Oh , yeah ? You try telling your boy that his mom 's not gonna be taking him to the park anymore after school . In fact , she won 't be coming home . Ever . I 'm sure losing Pauline was incredibly hard for both of you . I loved my wife more than you 'll ever know . And I 'd give anything to have her back . Jim . Why do you want the egg ? To save this town . Or maybe it 's just another power play . Turns out you don 't know me as well as I thought you did . - You couldn 't get anything out of him ? - Nothing . Any word from the tail ? Actually two blocks away , he doubled back and , well , he lost them . What ? You said this would work . That he would lead us somewhere related to where he came out . I 'm trying to reacquire his whereabouts as fast as possible . And I got a message from our field team saying ... - Shut up . - Dad . I got out . I need your help . Damn it . Dad , I got out . I need your help . Where 's the red door ? It 's on a root cellar in the backyard . Come on . - Root cellar ? What the hell is that ? - Leftover from Prohibition . Weird coincidence , don 't you think ? Way back to Chester 's Mill being on your property ? If you still believe in coincidence , you 're not paying attention . Come on . Some guy gave me 10 bucks to come ring the buzzer and play that for you . He 's a decoy . Get him the hell out of here . Have the grounds searched now . We may have a breach . Search the property . That 's mine . From the day it was painted . All right , come on . All right . Let 's go . Let 's go . Gotta check , they were here . Come on ! Come on , we gotta go . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know . I ... - Over by the dam ! - Either you go or you get caught . - It 's your choice . - All the way back there . - All the way back . - See anything ? Tunnel that led us from Chester 's Mill was hidden behind a locker or something . Is that it ? That wasn 't there before . Help me move some of these . All right . Let 's go . Come on . Ah-ah-ah . Look , I appreciate all your help getting us here . But I 'm telling you , you don 't wanna do this . I got nobody here except Pauline . And you think your dad 's gonna give me a promotion if he catches me ? All right , go . What are you looking for ? Oh , hey , kiddo . I 'm just looking for some of your mom 's things . Things to take with us ? " Take with us ? " Please don 't leave me here with my dad . Oh , James . Your dad 's gonna take good care of you . Don 't worry about that . The way he took good care of Mom ? I 'm sorry , buddy , I can 't take you with me . Then Mom lied . About what ? She said you were going to save me one day . I was hoping that was today . Now it 'll be there forever . So one day you 'll see it and remember how little you used to be . Will you come back before I grow big ? I hope so . Why are you only here today ? I don 't know , but my mom wanted me to meet you . And I 'll see you again one day . Promise . What the hell ? We 're back somehow . - Where 's the others ? - Pauline ? I don 't know about this , Lyle . Sam ? Lyle ? Melanie ? Melanie ? This is where it began . And this is where it ends . For all of us . I don 't understand . Tell me what you mean . - Hey , you guys okay ? - Yeah . - Where 's Lyle ? - He was ahead of me . Oh , my God , what if he didn 't make it ? Come on . Hey , coming through , did any of you guys see stuff ? - I couldn 't see crap . - I did . - Like a memory . - Mine was like a premonition . Lyle should 've been there , but he wasn 't . Stay here and wait for him . - Where are you going ? - To get my son . I 'm gonna go find Julia . Everybody needs to keep a low profile , all right ? Anyone in this town sees that we 're back , and it 's gonna cause chaos . Once I come up with a plan , I 'll find you . Hunter , stay out of trouble . Lay low . I 'm coming with you . I wanna see Junior . No . I have to do this alone . You need to stay here and find Lyle , please . Now that we 're back , whatever 's gonna happen , we need Lyle . I can 't believe I made it through . Now I 'm really here in Chester 's Mill . Buckle up , kid . It 's about to get a lot weirder . No better place to hide than right under my dad 's nose . It 's so peaceful down here . We should get going . Can we just lie here for a little while ? Enjoy the peacefulness ? It would help me feel less alone . Pauline ?

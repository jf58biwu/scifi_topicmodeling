I 'm fine . It 's nothing . It 'll get better . What about you ? Are you okay ? I 'm sorry . Koto ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Koto ? I 'm really sorry . Why didn 't you tell her anything ? didn 't I ? I told you to take care of her ! She 's not the only one . either ... Why do you always just stand there and never say anything ? You knew the dream would change . Don 't get so mad . After all this has happened ... After all this ... How can I not be mad ? But ... No buts ! I 'm sorry . Stop acting like that ! Jeez ... You 're certainly not acting like you haven 't seen each other in centuries . That form ... Father . We are no longer children . Isn 't it about time you told us what 's going on ? who Koto is ? Sir ! Um ... Yase Douji is in front of the station right now ... Wow ! How fun ! I can see people ! my ! Yase ! What are you doing there ? hello . Who are you ? You 're so pretty ! Yase ...

We 've got unwelcome guests ! they 've found out about your paradise ! What do you mean ? What do we mean ? Exactly what we said ! Inari kept it a secret this whole time ! The paradise they dream of . They want to go ! They can 't go ! well ! But it 's tough to keep secrets from the Shrine ! that 's it for the land of the dreams ! What ? What are you trying to say ? Koto ... You 're special ! A special little girl ! You were born between a god and a buddha ! That makes you super syncretic ! What 's the Chief Priest doing here ? little girl ? The world you see in the mirror is imaginary : the one that shouldn 't exist . The 13th plane ? You 're early . How many years has it been since we 've met in person ? It 's been a long time . but even we have difficulties preventing unexpected accidents . Inari . I understand why you 'd want to hide it . Don 't you ? I 'd appreciate it if you 'd just pretend you never found out about it . Unfortunately ... Chief Priest ! Koto ! Why did you come here personally ? Koto . and vanish once again . You and your parents are just so out of control . so it 's all okay . Hold it ! What you just said ... the end " ? Do you know how much Katsura has been worrying about you ? Chief Priest ! The Looking Glass City is going to be destroyed . That 's not good at all ! There 's no way around it . Not now . No ! Ichijouji and the others might know something ! Chief Priest ! I don 't want to destroy this place . there 's nothing we can do ... It 's the Unified Organization 's job to keep right ? too . then I 'll just decide to do it myself ! Koto . You can 't do that . there are things I can 't allow . This is a place that should never have been allowed to exist . The 13th plane ... Where did you learn that ? then that makes this simple . made through pure force by your father when he violated the rules of the role he was given . Do you intend to make me explain everything ? observer . Observer ? Sensei ... doesn 't exist inside a picture . It is one of the planes created without the Shrine 's knowledge . I 'd be in big trouble if they found out . but ... Koto . This isn 't a place where forced intervention is even supposed to be possible . But you did it ! didn 't you ? the rest is simple . She 's very bold . She reminds me of someone . But even if it shouldn 't be allowed to exist ... It already does . Can 't we just leave it ? Koto . Do you remember what you just called this place ? The 13th plane . It 's connected to the other 12 . All of them . didn 't I ? It 's causing a chain reaction everywhere ! No ... Sis ! No way ... Do you understand ? This is the result of your playing house . and messed with the fabric of reality however you pleased . Did you think that was your task as an observer ? Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 24 : The Present ( 18 ) / Koto I am grateful to you . you helped me . your giving me the role of the Fox Mask let Koto grow up to be the girl she is . But I understood . even a little light could be found ... How much the idea of someone to stand with me meant ... Even if the result was twisting the fabric of reality ? I feel no uncertainty . I know what 's most important to me . Observer ... Do you honestly think you 've become human ? Are you saying it 's wrong to want love if you 're not human ? This is nonsense . Sheer stupidity . A ? Un ? What 's wrong ? Sensei ! Darling ! Koto ! Mom ! Koto ... I 'm fine . It 's nothing serious . it is ! What is this ? my ! Fireworks in the daytime ? Your mother lost her former powers when she gave birth to a daughter . It seems you inherited all her power . she shouldn 't be able to exist outside the Holy Place . No good will come of making her strain herself . Especially now . It 's my fault . My mom was stuck there because I was born . It 's my fault ... To think this was the result of your gallant search for home . How ironic . Koto . Koto . You don 't know how happy we were when you were born ... Koto ! It 's all my fault ... Koto ! Look over here ! Koto ! My fault ... Koto ! My ! Koto ... What the hell are you doing ? It should take more than this to knock you off your feet . Hey . and they 're right over there ! My real parents and my real siblings died a long time ago ! Your parents are alive ! and do what you can while they 're alive ! You awake now ? Yup ! I 've got something else I need you to do . I can 't have you die here . Yeah . You 're right . You 're right . so get that old man to see things your way . Yeah . after all . Yeah . Chief Priest ! I 've decided ! I 'll destroy all the planes ! I 'm not sure that 's ... My . There 's no point if it ends here . then . Shrine ?

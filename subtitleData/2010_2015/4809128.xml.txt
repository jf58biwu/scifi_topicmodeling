 Battleship [ 2012 ] Blu-ray [ HI ] = = sync , corrected by elderman = = [ Man ] Today really marks the first stage ... of an unprecedented technological advancement . We have begun to identify so-called Goldilocks planets . These are planets that share a similar relationship with their sun ... as we have with ours . If a planet 's too far away from its sun , it 's too cold . If it 's too close to its sun , it 's too hot . But for an Earth-like planet , the distance is just right . Potentially perfect for sustaining life . We have finally managed to identify one planet ... that is the right distance from its star to hold water ... and is the right mass to sustain an atmosphere . Every 24 hours , our station in Hawaii ... will transmit a signal to Landsat 7 , our deep-orbiting satellite , which will amplify and relay the signal to our targeted planet , which is rather grandly entitled Planet G. If there is intelligent life out there and they come here , it 's gonna be like Columbus and the Indians . Only we 're the Indians . Ladies and gentlemen , please prepare to bear witness ... to the making of history . Start transmission .

Sir , they 've killed everything that 's fired on them . Get the guns on line , or we ram this thing . They killed my brother and every man on his ship ! We have no weapons to attack with , sir . Then set course to 310 . - That 's a collision course ! Are you clear on that ? - 310 ! [ Beast ] Sir , there are sailors in the water . Get the guns on line , or we 're gonna ram this thing . Sir , the Myoko is sinking ! Sir , please ! Set the course to 310 ! There are sailors in the water , sir ! - Hard starboard . - Hard starboard . Aye , sir . - Get ' em out of the water . - Yes , sir . [ Sailor ] What ? What 's happening ? [ Chattering ] Shut up , man . What the hell is happening ? What the hell are- - are they doing ? Why aren 't they attacking ? Are those things aliens ? - Would you please shut up ? - We need help ! We need to get the carrier over here ! - Who 's running the ship ? - Hopper . Are you kidding me ? Hopper 's running the ship ? - This is bullshit . - We 're all gonna die ! What the hell are those things ? What is that shit ? [ Radio : Officer ] Comms are down up here . You got anything ? [ Radio : Pilot ] That 's a negative on all frequencies . [ Metallic Rattling ] Oh , shit . [ Shouting ] Abandon , 9-30 ! Kill the engine !

[ People Shouting , Screaming ] [ Admiral Shane ] Sir , I can 't explain this . We 've lost communication with everyone on the other side of the barrier . We can 't get in , and they can 't get out . [ Commander ] The field , whatever it is , extends about 300,000 feet in altitude ... and has a depth of about two nautical miles . [ Officer ] We are in contact with Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet . But right now , our navy is effectively trapped outside the area . So we have nobody in there ? Well , sir , we have three guided missile destroyers still unaccounted for . So it 's conceivable we do have somebody inside . Well , who ? [ Sailors Shouting , Grunting ] [ Gasping , Whimpering ] Okay . Thank you ! Captain ! Captain ! [ Shouting In Japanese ] [ Shouting In Japanese ] [ Cannon Explosion ] - My grandmother could climb this mountain . - It 's a start , Mick . What was that ? I 'm not sure . [ Electronic Beeping , Squawking ] [ Rumbling ] [ Siren Blaring ] What the hell are you guys doing up here ? I need you off this mountain right now . - Wait . What 's going on ? Why ? - The island 's under attack . Attack ? By who ? I don 't know . People are using the word " alien . " Aliens ? We don 't know . Whatever it is took out the marine base , and all roads leading to this mountain have been destroyed . Cell phones , radios , Internet- - everything is shut down . The navy 's engaged just off of the coast . The navy ? I need you and your friend off of this mountain right now . Come on , let 's go . Vic , leave your car here . We 'll go block the road . [ Doors Closing ] [ Engines Start ] Where are you going ? Mick ! Where are you going ? I ain 't never seen an alien . Have you ever seen an alien ? Mick ! Don 't leave me alone . Brah , you saw that ? What the hell was that ? Vince , did you see that ? [ Radio : Vince ] It looked like a jet . Brah , I 've never- - [ Yelling ] [ Screaming ] [ Knocking ] Sir , we need you . We need you now . I can 't . If you can 't , who can ? Captain . Where did we find it ? One of their transporters must have crashed on the way over to the island . There was debris everywhere . Thomas and Potts just fished him out of the water with a grappling hook . It was a bad idea , but they kept yanking . I kept telli " 'em no , and they kept- - [ Sighs , Hums ] [ Grunting ] Okay . Oh , shit . [ Hissing ] [ Screaming ] Damn ! [ Sailor Gasping , Panting ] Beast , flashlight . My dad said they 'd come . Said it my whole life . He said we ain 't alone . He said one day we 'd find them ... or they 'd find us . Know what else he said ? He said , " I hope I ain 't around when that day comes . " - [ Gasps ] - [ Shrieks ] Not dead ! Not dead ! - [ Growling , Wheezing ] - [ Ordy ] Not dead ! Not dead ! [ Hopper Gasping ] [ Grunting ] - [ Groans ] - [ Wheezing , Gasping ] [ Shouting ] [ High-pitched Squeal ] [ Grunts ] [ Electrical Crackling ] [ Rattling ] I got a bad feeling about this . What kind of bad feeling ? Like , " We 're going to need a new planet " kind of bad feeling . [ P.A. : Officer ] Medical casualty , C53 . Two men down . They 're still on the ship . Lock down the ship ! Is everyone all right ? All good , Chief . Is everyone accounted for ? [ Radio : Officer ] Just heard something on level four . Raikes , up . - [ Shrieking ] - Hey ! Move !

Mahalo , mother- - [ Snorts ] - [ Shallow Breathing ] - We got to get off this mountain . The cop left the keys on his belt . You got to go down there and get ' em . You can do it . [ Exhales , Shallow Breathing ] [ Snorting ] [ Hydraulics Hissing ] [ Whimpering ] [ Soft Gasp ] [ Blusters ] [ Whispers ] Now . [ Radio : Static ] This is an emergency call . Can anyone hear me ? Radio check . Can anyone hear me ? Over . - Hey , wait up ! Don 't leave ! Don 't leave ! - Stop right there ! - Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - Who are you ? I 'm Cal Zapata . We sent out a beacon . Oh , shit ! Is he a cyborg ? Are you guys with them ? If he 's human , could you have him put the gun down ? - Just please put the- - - Mick , put your gun down . I mean , I told them that something like this could happen . I said it 's gonna be like Columbus and the Indians ... or the Conquistadors and the Incans . They just thought , " Oh , no , they 'll be sweet . " They killed my grad student ! [ Gasping ] - [ Wheezing ] - Okay . Okay . Calm down . - I can 't . [ Wheezing ] - Slow . Slow . Sit down . - I can 't breathe . - You 're fine . Slow breaths , slow breaths . - You 're freaking him out , Mick . - I doubt it takes much to freak him out . We need- - We need the marines . We need the army . We need all of them . [ Nogrady ] It is the strong belief of the Chinese ... that what crashed into Hong Kong was some sort of communications ship . So you 're saying that a flying telephone cratered ... and took out 25,000 people ? What I 'm saying is that our visitors seem extraordinarily concerned ... with establishing a line of communication home . If they 've lost their communication ship , how could they do that ? The same way we did . Our communications station in Hawaii ... has the ability to send a message to deep space via the Landsat 7 satellite . I believe it 's for that asset they 've domed the islands . We 're looking at an extinction-level event . The most critical part of any military operation : establish communications , reinforcements , follow-on forces . You 're saying E.T. wants to phone home ? That would be incredibly , incredibly bad . I mean , so far , only five ships have made contact . If five ships can do this , what do you think 50 can do or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000 ? Sir , if I could just have a minute . Just give me one second . Why am I staring at a lizard ? Because this is my pet lizard , sir : Penelope the Third . - And ? - And they have the exact same eyes . You have 15 seconds . Go . Okay , sir . I-I-I put the helmet on , and the helmet is just basically extreme sunglasses . It 's just some hydration and some oxygen saturation ... and a bunch of other stuff I don 't understand . But we took Penelope to the beach one time , which was a terrible idea . She went absolutely crazy because she can 't handle the sunlight . You see ? And I don 't think that they can handle the sunlight either . You try anything else on ? N-Negative , sir . Just the helmet . Just the helmet . Scientists have confirmed that there was a U.F.O. landing ... in the Pacific Ocean , off the coast of Hawaii . Today , I wanted to update the American people ... on what we know about the situation in Hawaii . First , we are bringing all available resources to bear . [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Continues In Japanese ] The news has sparked global unrest as the populations panic , unleashing an unprecedented wave of chaos across the world . Many governments have declared martial law . Just scramble the jets , Admiral . We need to get in there ! I 'm far more aware than you of the need to get inside there ! But wasting lives will not help . You want me to send up another plane ? I 'll do it the second you come on up here ... and put your ass in the copilot 's seat , sir ! Are they transmitting ? Well , they could be , but it wouldn 't do them any good . There 's no satellite to receive the transmission . - We beam to Landsat 7 . - What 's Landsat 7 ? It 's our deep-space satellite . It only orbits into range once every 24 hours . - When is the satellite in position ? - 8 : 43 a.m. Got about five hours , and then they 'll use it to slingshot their transmission . - Slingshot where ? - I don 't know . Wherever it is they 're from . [ Hopper ] Pearl Harbor here . We 're approximately here . And they , whatever they are , are somewhere in the middle . We 're trapped out here . What we know right now ... is we can 't target them unless we have a plain line of sight . Without radar , we have no way to track them , correct ? Correct . But I don 't think they can see us either . - Why ? - Because we are still alive . Okay , so they can 't see us , and we can 't see them , and we have no way to hit them from a safe distance . [ Sighs ] There is a way . - A way ? - A way of seeing them ... without seeing them . You 're going to reference Art of War right now , aren 't you ? What are we supposed to do , fight the enemy where they aren 't , move like water ? 'Cause I 've read that thing , like , six times . It makes no sense . That book is Chinese . Still makes no sense . My way is much more simple . We 've been doing it to America for 20 years . Water displacement . How do you track water displacement ? - Tsunami buoys . - Tsunami buoys ? You have them surrounding your islands , transmitting displacement data . We hack into their transmissions , form a grid . - You can 't track anything without radar . - I don 't need radar . Just the radio frequencies . Turn off Aegis radar , please . [ Ordy ] Who is this guy ? Chief Moore . Sir . - Secure SPY . - Securing SPY , sir . Display NOAA data . NOAA data ? That 's correct . You heard him . Display NOAA data . [ Clears Throat ] [ Typing ] [ Electronic Twittering ] [ Beeping ] - [ Raikes ] What the hell is that ? - [ Hopper ] It 's a buoy . If it gets hit by a wave , it transmits a signal . [ Beeping ] [ Icons Beeping ] Bring up chart plot . Chart plot . Bring it up . [ Typing ] So we can track without radar . We would practice it as a contingency plan . You dirty , cheating , sneaky- - Rough world . I like it . Captain . My chair is your chair , sir . Brother would have done the same . I wish we could get ahold of Hopper . Who 's Hopper ? He 's a tactical actions officer ... on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer . It has the resources that could take this entire mountain out . Well , great . That makes a lot of sense . Let 's call him . We can 't . Everything is jammed . They 're using an electromagnetic field to block our signals . It 's more like a pulse . It 's not a brick wall . There 's gaps , okay ? From inside the barrier , we might just be able to get a call out . If I could get to my spectrum analyzer , then theoretically we could find a frequency that we could broadcast on- - Do you have a piece of equipment that can make a call ? - Yeah . - Get it . Well , I can 't , because it 's down there , in that nest of aliens . - You 're gonna go get it . - No . Yes . [ Sam ] Yes . We are looking for patterns of water displacement . [ Pinging ] That buoy 's underwater . That 's a ship . - Get on your gun . - Sir . [ Pinging Continues ] Target , Echo-1-1 . Roger . Echo-1-1 . Ready to fire . When we fire , they will know where we are . Fire ! [ Rapid Beeping ] - Ordy , anything ? - Negative , sir . It 's a miss . It 's heading towards us . You ready ? I 'm sorry , but there is no possible way that I 'm going down there . I- - I do not possess that kind of courage . Right now , you 're gonna acquire that courage , or I 'm gonna break my steel leg off into your ass . You feel me ? I feel you . Go . Now . Acquiring courage . Acquiring courage . [ Beeping ] [ Case Rattling ] [ Rattling Stops ] What ? [ Pinging Continues ] - Foxtrot-2-4 . - Foxtrot-2-4 . - Ready to fire . - Fire ! - Ordy , anything ? - Negative , sir .

Where are you ? - Oh , thank God . I 'm okay . - [ Radio : Static ] Listen , they 're here at the satellite array at Saddle Ridge . Do you copy ? [ Snaps Fingers ] They 're going to transmit a signal and establish communication . You need to destroy the facility . - We have four hours . - Four hours . I copy . - [ Pinging ] - Hopper . [ Sam ] Can you hear me ? Babe , you need to get out of there . Hopper ? Hopper ? - [ Static ] - No , they 're gone . They 're gone . [ Mick ] We 'd better get gone too .

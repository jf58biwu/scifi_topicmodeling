I thought you were supposed to take some photos of me ? - Washington , have you got a visual on ... - What was that , Houston ? - Hey , Washington , it 's Helium-3 . - What ? It 's a Helium-3 mine . Get over here ! Hey , there 's something over here you need to see ! No ! Sanders ! Sanders ! San ... ah ! Oh , God ! Houston , Houston ! Son-of-a-bitch . I need to get out of here . I must be trippin ' . In english now . Where are we from ? - Siegfried ! - The Earth . And , when did we leave ? - Brunhilda ? - 1945 . - And where did we go ? - The dark side of the moon . Brilliant ! Don 't try to play dumb with me . It was your bad idea to send those idiots to the moon ? - Talk about disaster . - I 'm not to be contrarian madam President but I 'm pretty sure it was your idea . It was my great idea if have they succeeded . Now it 's your stupid idea , got it ? I didn 't hire you for stupid ideas . I hired you because of your Midas touch . Now my approval ratings are in the toilet and the election is just weeks ... You dropped the ball , Vivian ! You ! Now , I need a miracle . Get me a miracle ! Actually , how was sending those two astronauts to the Moon , supposed to getting me re-elected ? Exactly ? We haven 't been to the Moon for 50 years . One of them was black . Thought it would look good . Look good how ? Like I said , one of them was black . Just think of the opportunity we wasted years ago with that errand boy , Powell , Alan Powell ? - Colin Powell . - That was close . - And where are you going ? - The UN , to do my job . " The Great Dictator " by Charlie Chaplin . It is one of the world 's most famous short films . Which illustrates in just 10 minutes , his wish that one day , the entire world that will be held in the great Führer 's wise and gentle hands . - Any questions ? - I have a question . In my classroom we are here to strictly formal manner in addressing one another . To what do we owe the honor of this visit ? We captured an earthling . Your expertise is required . Hey ! Sauerkraut , right ? No , no no ! I love me some sauerkraut . And Volkswagen . Huh ... Fahrvergnügen . Hey ! German words , right ? You know , it 's as if , like ... Where I come from we speak German too . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Damn ! You gonna be sorry you did that , white boy . You are a knock-out . How do I get out of here ? Thanks lady . Have a nice day . No , Mr. Subhuman . That is the air lock ... No ! No ! You might wanna ... cover up a bit . All good ? I would not do if I was you . Listen to me . Listen to me ! I know a lot of important people . They 're very important people . I even know the President of the United States of America . Now ... If you kill me , then that 's just a really fucked-up situation . You know the president of the United States of the Americas ? Thanks , homie . I talk to you later , baby . Question , what is this apparatus ? Look man , how would I know ? I 'm just a model . - A model what ? Citizen ? - No man , a model model . Damn , what 's wrong with you two ? You blind or something ? - Shit , I 'm pretty . - Are you part of the shock troops - before the invasion ? - Invasion ? Man , you all must be tripping ? What is your mission ? Look dude , I just follow the paycheck , you know what I 'm saying ? - What is this device ? - That 's my kick-ass cellphone - ... and a computer . - What ? That is not a computer . This is a computer . No man . That 's ancient history , homie . I am telling you once again . One moment we received conformation that the ship has landed successfully on the moon . The next , all communications stopped . - As though it had simply vanished . - Or you 're hiding something from us ? Yeah , we are hiding something on the dark side of the moon . I still find it very difficult to believe that the entire purpose of the mission was to promote your president 's re-election . Well , believe what you like , we had mere senators spend hundreds of millions on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit posts . But Mr. Secretary , the expenses involved this time only make sense if there was a military purpose . Okay , let 's get this clear . The United State has no military activity on the Moon . What about natural resources activity ? We know how the U.S. sometimes mixes the two up . Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium-3 up there ? Helium-3 ? You just made that up , didn 't you ? That 's so silly . I assume these are just preliminary ideas ? Sir , we have a very small delivery window . - Sir ? - Yes , sir . Ma 'am , and this is all . Anyone who is not the head of the department , should leave . You idiots ! You morons ! That 's an insult to morons . What is this shit ? I have a meeting with the President of the United fucking States of America tomorrow fucking morning ! Not the President of fucking Zambia ! Not the President of the fucking Janitor 's Union ! But with the president of the fucking country which you just happen to be living in at the fucking moment ! You pieces of hellacious shit ! What am I supposed to tell her ? That my employees are not intelligent enough , to be fucking morons ? Are you willing to work with the Führer ... in the name of the fatherland , stand behind the Wehrmacht . This decision does not resolve all of us ... Thank you . I thought my ears were gonna bleed . You 're welcome . May I ask what 's your name is ? Washington , James Washington . - What 's yours ? - Renate Richter . It is a pleasure to meet you , Washington . James Washington . What 's wrong with your skin ? Come on now , please . I mean ... You have met a brother before , right ? - No , I 'm an only child . - No , no , I didn 't mean like that . I meant a black man . No , and this continues to confuse me because you are much blacker when I first encountered you . Okay girl look , either I 'm black or you 're blind . Look , what is going to happen to me ? I mean , what 's with this , this guy that keeps sticking needles in me ? - What about that other angry dude ? - My father 's sticking needles into you ? That freaking scientist guy ? That 's your dad ? And what about , you know ... . ? Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs-Oberführer Adler ? - I 'm sorry , what ? - Klaus Adler . He 's going to be the next führer . And my husband . What ? You lose a bet or something ? I mean ... . Look ... Lucky you . Actually , lucky him . - I shouldn 't even be here . - You cannot leave me tied up like this . - Please do me a favor . - What ? - Play a Nazi . - And what if I don 't ? - They will eliminate you . - Oh , great ! Look ... Is there a different radio station ? With the upcoming war ... He 's back . Okay , mini Mengele . Hey man , I don 't like the look of this . With the prisoner now being one of us , we will go down to Earth . He will help us to find more telephone computers . We return . And then get the Götterdämmerung flying . - You smell that ? - No . We don 't have time to waste . Take me to that president of yours . What ? The President ? Come on man , I thought you wanted me to take you to Mac store or something . You said that you would know that President of these United States of the Americas . Right , of course . That President . May I meet this President too ? Hey , Miss . Richter . Welcome to my planet . - Get the hell out of my property . - We better get out of here ! Run for it ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Now , hold on there Boss man . That may not be the sharpest move . Look , look . I 'll tell you what . Let me go talk to the brothers . All right ? They know me , you know . I 'm one of them . Are you with me ? Yeah ! Now ! Now you 're talking . All right . Now . Wassup ? I 'm serious . You don 't know how good it is to see you all , man . It 's like little Africa up in this bitch . Come on people . You all know me . I know you do . - Washington . - I mean ... That ain 't one of yours , is it ? Because ... Ah , look , man . You ain 't got to bring that shit out . Look man , it 's all good . Look , I 'm a peace loving brother , man . Fuck it , man ! Yo ! Yo ! Are you all right ? Do I fucking look alright to you Miss crazy fucking Nazi ? I mean ... What the hell just happened ? You know ? Oh , no mother-effin way ! What did you sick sons-a-bitches do to me ? - I should 've told you . - What ? That I look like a fucking polar bear ? You know what ? You two really , really know how to fuck up a guy 's Christmas . Quiet , you fool ! What is wrong with you ? We made you Aryan , you 're one of us now . - You should be thanking us . - Thanking you ? What I should have done is let those brothers come here with their size 15s and put a foot so far up in your ass , you can taste your toe nails for 2 fucking weeks . Klaus ! Bring me to your leader , James Washington . Hey , what the fuck ? Excuse me . Get your fucking hands off me , you mother ... - Is she your boss ? - Yes , she 's the big cheese . - And she knows the president ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . They real tight . Come on . You fuckin ' animal ! Do you know who I am , huh ? Do you ? You just kidnapped the wrong woman . The wrong fucking woman . Oh yeah . I hope you 're having a good time I 'm gonna kick your fucking ass . Excellent . My turn . I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich . We are based on the Moon . I 'm told you know the president of these United States of the Americas . You will take us to that President , because ... - I have a very special present for him . - Him ? Well , he 'll love that . He just loves presents . As soon as my mission is accomplished the Nazi invasion force will be called in under my directions and we will end the good times for the bad people . And just how do you propose to do that ? - We will simply eliminate them . - What ? - Sorry , that is not what we were told ... - Renate , I do not think that you ... Yeah . Why not ? Why don 't you tell this fräulein why we 're here , just like you keep telling your pupils . I would love to do that . You see ... the National Socialist Party is the people 's party , nothing more . We wish to return to Earth with our message of peace and unity love through virtue . And kindness , for example . We are healthy , in mind and body . Our spirits are brave and true . We achieved that because we are strong , disciplined in our cause . There is simply no belief that can match ours ... because peace and unity is the gift we bring to all mankind . - What you and all earthlings need to know ... - Yeah , yeah . I get it , Hedwig ... This is good . This is gonna work . You , I need . And you ... I want . Alright ... Let 's go meet the president . Madam President ... here is the miracle you asked for . - Who is this man ? - He will lead the campaign troops . Renate , please ... This is very simple . The world is sick ... and we are the doctors . The world has anemic and we are the vitamin . The world is weary , but we are the strength . We are here to make the world healthy once again . With hard work ... with honesty , with clarity , with decency . We are the product of loving mothers and brave fathers . We are the embodiment of love and bravery . We are the gift of both God and science . We are the answer to the question . We are the promise delivered to all mankind . For that we raise our hand , to one nation . We step to the beat of one drum . - We march to the beat of one heart . - ... on this world . We are the people who will carry the children on our shoulders in the same way as our fathers carried us and their fathers carried them . We are the one people united and strong . We are the one people with certainty . Moral certainty . We are invincible and we have no fear . Because the truth makes us one . Hey ! The moon Nazis are coming . What 's wrong with you people , can 't you see ? Look , I 've been there . I 'm telling you . They 've got this whole moon base , they got this whole like space thing goin ' on , and they comin ' to take over . Oh , you never listen to this , right ? Listen now ' cause they comin , they comin ' . They coming to get us all . Why aren 't you guys listening to me ? I mean ... Renate . Washington .

Farwell , fashionista . I have a planet to conquer . I will just grab this . Bye ! Good luck with the rest of your life . Unbe-fucking-lievable . Thank you , Kelly . Moments ago New York has been under attack . Witness claim to have seen hundreds of UFO 's appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire . Billy get that ! Get that ! Are you getting that ? Kelly , the craft is at least 60 feet across . I 'm seeing what appears to be weapons of some kind dangling down from the bottom . Oh my God ! It 's opening fire ! It 's opening fire ! I 'm getting the hell out of here . There is little information . But here 's what we know at this time . - Ok . You see , the thing is , that Klaus ... - I know it was you doing . - It 's wonderful . - It 's wonderful ? It 's brilliant . I 'm a wartime president now . All presidents who start a war in their first term always get re-elected . I thought I was gonna have to bomb Australia or something . But no . You bring me real ... - Who are these guys anyway ? - Nazis . - From the moon . - Real life Nazis ? Holy shit , this just keeps getting better and better . You are a miracle worker babe . They are the only guys we ever actually managed to beat in a fair fight ? I 'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt . Only , you know , I 'm not spastic . I knew you 'd be excited . So , if you 're Roosevelt , then who 's General Patton or you know , MacArthur ? Mr Secretary of Defense , do you have any thought on this ? Send her . - Me ? - Hey you 're the miracle worker . Apparently you dodge bullets too . - I wouldn 't know ... - What to wear ? You will think of something , you always do . Madam President ... ready to face the music ? It 's the space Nazis !

I couldn 't give a good goddamn what they have . I 'm not going back to that place . No way ! You want to look like that for the rest of your life ? Great , now this is my fault . - Let me in . - I am no hero , James . I need you . Do you know how to drive this thing ? Well . Can 't be any different than playing " Wing Commander " . Let 's try ... I swear we do not have nothing on the Moon . - Japan ? - It is not ours . - China ? - It is not us . It 's bloody well not ours . - I confess . - Yes , North Korea ? Confess to what ? The spaceships are ours . Our beloved leader designed and built them himself . - What 's so funny ? - All right , North Korea . Sit down . - So , it was you India , I knew that . - No , no ! This is a sign of peace . - This is the sign of peace . - Just cut it out , you morons ! These thugs are Nazis and I mean the real McCoy . They have been hiding out on the Moon just waiting to pounce . Now my question is , what do you all plan to do about it ? 'Cause we just happen to have a little something up our own sleeve . And I 'm sure you 'll be thankful for it . May I present to you with the Mars exploration ship , The USS George W. Bush . Good work , take it to Officer Tyler , please . This is trajectory , what 's our status on the orbit window ? Commander on deck . The hostile fleet has launched a full scale aerial attack against the United States . These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they are operating fully within the thermosphere . Each of them approximately carrying 200 enemy vessels , and are extremely ... Hell hath no fury , Herr Adler . Alright kiddies , let 's get this show on the road . Vivian , you look great . How is it going up there ? Madam President , I couldn 't be better . I am packing dozens of megatons of nuclear warheads which I am going to carefully place up Klaus 's kraut ass - ... just as soon I get him in my sight . - Carry on , kick butt . Let 's see what that baby can do ! Working at optimum capacity . Ammo consumption within tolerance . We 're coming under extremely heavy fire . We gonna need reinforcement right now . What the hell is the meaning of this ? Good day mates . This is Australian ship , Dundee 01 . Ready to kick ass . Spitfire reporting in . Hanging in there W. Canada joining the battle . This is a direct violation of this nations space treaty that you all signed , every single one of you . MIR is ready to join the battle . That was supposed to be destroyed . This is an outrage , you 're all liars , just like my ex ex-husband . - Calm down lady , calm down . - Don 't you lady me , Pinko . Okay , who didn 't arm their spaceships ? Great , great . That 's just great - You all gave me your word . - But you broke yours . We always break ours , that 's just what we do . Okay , fine , fine , fine ! Let just beat shit out of these pricks and talk about the details later . This is beautiful . - Where the hell are we going ? - To the Götterdämmerung . I think Klaus will be there . What did you think of that , Herr Adler ? Alright , what about this Moon business ? What do you say we head on over and slap them around a bit ? Klaus , baby I 'm coming to get ya ' . - What the hell is this place ? - This is the Götterdämmerung . It will liberate the Earth . Actually , it is the biggest war machine ever created by man . - This is the bridge . That 's where I 'm going . - I need to find your father , so ... - Where do you think he at ? - I think you will find him over there . Try to sneak in , and please paralyse the engines . - Or otherwise the earth is destroyed . - Note to self , paralyse the engines . Got it . Oh . No , no no no . - What ? - You be careful . - I mean you know ... - What ? - Because you like me . - Right ... Oh , come on , a little . I mean ... You like me ? We have a visual on the Nazi fortress , commander . Obvious and overstated as usually , Klaus . Alright , everyone , let 's get those nukes in action . I 'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone . But Commander , there are women and children down there . The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . - Prime warheads on secondary armament . - Roger that . Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment . Fire the fucking nukes ! Nukes away . Job well done ! Hey , quack ! You remember me ? The Moon spook you turned into a snowflake . Oh shit , it 's alive He sure must have the smallest dick in the universe . Time ... to fuck back . Everyone , take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire . - Offensive run confirmed . - Let her rip . What the fuck ? - Washington , do you hear me ? Washington ? - Where are you ? - You need to shut down the engines . - I 'm working on it . Shit ... Congratulations . High five . Well , that was disappointing . Do you think he suffered ? Even just a little ? Vivian , I knew you could do it . You 're foxy and salacious , all the way . Congratulations . - What 's Helium-3 ? - Helium . Did you say Helium-3 ? Yes , there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of this stuff . - That 's ours . - It is ? Why ? Helium-3 will make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for the next thousand years . Yes , it 's ours . No , no no . Hear me out . Hear me out . The moon is American soil . Moon flag , stars and stripes . Who beat the Moon Nazis ? We did . Well , yeah , yeah . Alright , you help out here and there , but ultimately , it 's just like World War II and who won that ? We did . - You lie . - You don 't believe me ? Watch the movie . Movies do not lie . Not the shoes , Jesus . Vivian , this is the Secretary of Defense . - Defend Helium-3 at all costs . - But against who ? Against everybody ! Unfortunately that 's the story of revenge . It 's messy . Never really works out the way you wanted to . I feel lonely . The eternal love of God , the love of God into our hearts , or we will burn ... burn in hell , burning in eternal damnation . Renate . Washington . You are alive . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . And you 're the way you meant to be . Are you aware that you are kissing a black man ? I guess you have a lot of work cut out for us . Corrected by Fingersmaster Hope you enjoyed !

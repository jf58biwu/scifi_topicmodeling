 I 'm sorry . Don 't be . You did what everyone around here 's been wanting to do for days . You take it way too easy on me . But I get it now . For the longest time , I was so mad at you for going off on that population control officer back in Chicago . Sometimes you can 't help yourself . You want the good news or the bad news first , Sheriff . Surprise me . The good news is , your son 's free to go . No , I 'm staying with him . Josh ? Believe me , I wanted to kill you , young Shannon , a lot . But , uh , I was , uh ... I was persuaded otherwise . Get him out of here . Dad ? - Dad ? Dad ! - Hey ! - Take it easy . - Dad ! - It 's okay , Josh . - Don 't , don 't touch him ! Cool toy . Isn 't it ? Where 's my father ? I don 't know how you people can stand this place . Hold still . Bugs the size of dogs , plants that eat children . Why would anyone want to live in this nightmare ? What did you just give me ? Antihistamine for the itching . I 'll take it from here . Thank you , Nurse . Hello . I 'm Dr. Shannon . You feeling any better ? No . If anything the itching just got worse . Have you ever heard of Trichomonas Sastrei ? It 's a parasite known to cause heart lesions in slashers . In humans , the larvae attack the central nervous system and sort of burrow their way into the brain stem . From what I understand , it 's ... quite an excruciating way to die . Why are you telling me this ? Because you 've just been injected with half a million Trichomonas larvae . I switched out your antihistamine . Lucas Taylor is detaining my husband , and you are gonna help me get him out in change for the cure . One of these is an antiparasitic . Other two are poisonous . And only I know which is which . And as soon as my husband is free , I will tell you . Do we have a deal ? We don 't have to keep doing this . Just tell me where my father is . What the hell did he do to make you hate him so much ? What happened in Somalia ? He told you about that ? He said he couldn 't save your mother , That you blamed him for her death . He could have saved her , he chose not to . He let her die . He ... he watched her die . I don 't believe you . I was there ! I was there when the rebels took the city . When they lined the civilians up and told my father and his soldiers that they had to choose . Each soldier could save one person ... just one . They would have just executed me on the spot . But her ... her they ... they , uh ... took their time with . Lucas ... what happened ... was not his fault . They made him choose . You can 't blame him for that . No . He blamed me . I could see it in his eyes ... even at 14 ... and every time I disappointed him , and every time I didn 't live up to his expectations of what the great Nathaniel Taylor 's son was supposed to be . Lucas , you put this all on yourself . You , don 't patronize me . Lucas , we located your father 's camp . An assault team 's getting ready to roll out . - I want to be here . - I figured you would . They 're leaving from the south gate . Keep him alive . Jim ! What did they do to you ? The cure ! Give it to me . How long before it starts killing the parasites ? - Parasites ? What parasites ? - The ones you ... You were bluffing . You 're a highly-suggestible hypochondriac , Mr. Weaver . I suggest you see a doctor about that . Josh ! - Did you just give me ... - A sedative , yeah , I did . Josh ! Help me get your father out . We don 't have much time . Come on , girls . We 're getting out of here . - Mom ? - Yeah ? That was awesome . Skye managed to get a message to Taylor 's camp . They 're sending someone for us , but we have to make it to the tree line , okay ? With Josh 's help , I think I can make it . They 're looking for us . Shannon 's escaped , and Weaver 's gone missing . - You two , round it back . - Yes , sir . He 's alive . - Idiot . - All clear ! They 're gone . No one 's here . Wake this guy up . Let 's find these people . Wash . You made it . Dunham was right about the new perimeter grid . I disabled it with this controller . We got five minutes until they realize that this section is down . Where 'd you get your hands on that ? Swiped it off a very drunk guard at Boylan 's . He 's not gonna stay drunk forever . Once they trace that back to you , they 'll know you helped us escape . You gotta come with us . It 's 100 yards . You 'll never make it to the tree line unless someone distracts those guards . Wash ... the plan was for you to come with us . Jim ... there 's no other way . ... three and five secure . Repeat , towers three and five secure ... Go , and you save your family . Give Taylor a message for me , would you ? Remind him about Cu Lao Cham . Cu Lao Cham ? I don 't , I don 't know what that is . He 'll understand . Now ... you get ready to run like hell . - How will we know when ? - You 'll know . Thank you . Wash ... All towers , checkpoint Charlie . All towers , checkpoint Charlie . Mommy ... It 's okay , sweetheart . Just get ready , okay ? Explosion at the munitions depot ! - Thermal charges , at least four ! - Now . Suspect spotted ! Moving east ! All hands maintain circular vector . Go , go , go , go . There they come . - Dunham , bring ' em in . - Yes , Sir . - We have contact . - We have contact ! Go , go ! Yah ! Let 's go . Come on . You helped the Shannons escape . Where are they ? Tell me which way they went , and I might let you live . - Load up . We gotta go . - Yes , Sir . What happened to Wash ? She stayed behind , so we could get out . You have three seconds before I shoot . Taylor . No . It 's suicide . You can 't . One ... two ... You know , you have your father 's eyes . Is it true about Wash , Commander ? Afraid so . She was a good soldier . That she was . Get these folks settled , They 've had a long night . Is this where we 're going to live now , Daddy ? Just for a little while . Till the bad people go away , and then we 'll go home again , okay , sweetie ? Is Mark Reynolds around ? He 's on patrol duty . Okay . Ah , hell . Dunham . - Find Reynolds and take his shift . - Me ? Why ? Just do it , Private . Thanks . Well , you find anything out there in the Badlands ? We found something . Wait . We held up our end of the bargain . When are you going to hold up yours ? Don 't worry , you 'll be paid . I 'm talking about going back to 2149 . I want to see my daughter . As soon as the terminus is repaired , you and your people are free to go . Commander Taylor , sir ? Hey . Zoe Shannon . I 'm really sorry about what happened . Lieutenant Washington was a nice lady . She saved us . She did her duty right up to the end . She taught me how to make a fire . Well , did she now ? In survival training . What else did she teach you ? Which way 's north . And which way is it ? That way . She taught you good . Thanks . If you need another hug ... just ask . You okay ? Just thinking ... how many more people are going to die before this thing is over ? They 're bringing reinforcements . They 're going to bring back more men and more equipment , and they 're going to keep bringing them back , whatever it takes . We can 't give up hope , Jim . Okay ? 'Cause that 's what this place is about . It 's about hope and a second chance , and we cannot let them take that away from us . All right ? I 'm going to go talk to Taylor . Give him Wash 's message . Okay . I missed you so much . Me , too . Carnotaur . It 's okay . Perimeter 's mined . Besides , you can tell by the call it 's just a juvenile . Actually , they may be smaller , but juveniles are even more vicious . Kind of like hormonal teenagers with claws . Ooh . Dad ... Don 't mind me . I 'm just passing through . I got sentry duty . I-I should get back . Cu Lao Cham . Wash told you to remind me of Cu Lao Cham . I don 't know what it means . Our unit was pinned down on the island . We were outnumbered two-to-one . Only way on or off was a bridge to the mainland . So we blew the bridge , so they couldn 't bring any more troops across . So even though it was your only way out , you ... you trapped yourselves there . Well , we figured two-to-one was better than three-to-one , so what the hell , let 's make our stand . What happened ? I 'm still here , aren 't I ? The portal . That 's Cu Lao Cham bridge . As long as it 's open , they 'll keep bringing forces back till we 're overwhelmed and then they can start strip-mining , plundering this place for everything it 's worth . They 'll kill this world just as sure as they killed the world we left behind . Unless we blow the bridge . That 's what Wash was trying to tell us . Uh , wait now . Are you talking about taking out Hope Plaza ? That I am . Taylor , even if we could find a way to do it , we 'd be cutting ourselves off , too . That means no more meds , no more technology . No more colonists . A thousand people is all we 'd have to restart civilization . A thousand people ... that is a good round number . This is our home . If we have to cut ourselves off from that future in order to hold on to our home , then we 'll just have to survive out here with what we 've got . We 'll survive . But first , let 's kick some ass . Do you have any idea what a kilo of this stuff is worth in 2149 ? And we have three containers of it just sitting and gathering dust . Not for long . The terminus is fixed ? Malcolm Wallace just told me . That ore will be in our employer 's hands before nightfall . They are going to be happy to hear that . In fact , I might just take a little trip to 2149 . Present it to them in person . Anything to get away from here , even for a couple hours . - Excuse me , sir . - Yeah ? To what do I owe the pleasure ? Well , I 've been thinking a lot about what you said the other day . Mm-hmm . If you 're right that your father 's never going to forgive me for what I did , then why bother ? If my loyalty means nothing to him , maybe I 'm being loyal to the wrong side . Why does it have to be you , Jim ? Because I know Hope Plaza better than anybody . Besides , I broke into that place once before , remember ? Yeah , but that was so you could be with your family . This could take you away from us forever . Elisabeth , you said it yourself ... if we don 't fight them , then everything we 've sacrificed for , the life we want for our kids , will be taken away from us . I 'm not going to let that happen . How 's it coming ? Good to go . Let me show you how to arm this thing . Okay . This one unlocks the triggering mechanism , and this one starts the timer . Incoming ! - It 's okay , boys . - It 's one of ours . That is disturbingly convincing . We think so . Reynolds , Dunham , gather up . Reilly , - you all set ? - Yes , sir . Good . Your team ... you set ? Yes , sir . How about you , Commander ? Wasn 't easy , but we got the job done . We move out in five minutes . Jim . Right . All set here . Now remember , inject it as close to the heart as possible , okay ? You sure it 's enough ? This concentration ... it would kill three men instantly . Listen , I know you 're worried . - Tell the kids ... - Stop . Jim , don 't . Just ... Whatever you 're going to say can wait till you get back , okay ? 'Cause you will come back , won 't you , Jim ? Always . - All good ? - We 're all set to move out . - Whenever you 're ready . - Okay . Three 's a crowd . You heard the lady . Yes , sir . What ? What is it ? What if I told you I knew how to get in touch with your father ? Wait , what are you talking about ? You 're heading back to the colony ? Why ? I got some new information about my father . - I 'm going to follow it up . - Say again . I 'm getting interference from the terminus . Something 's come up . I 'll explain later . Okay , what about the cargo you were bringing ? I 'll have someone else drive it out to you . Lucas out . So , you really ready to do this ? Lure my father into an ambush ? Yeah , I 'm ready . All right . Uh , for the ambush part anyway . Good to go . Good luck . All right . Get this thing back to camp . We need as many vehicles as we can get . Will do . And just how do you think you 're going to get this thing started ? You don 't know the code . You know , I 'd beat it out of you , but , uh , afraid you might like that , dear brother . Guess I 'll just jack the starter . All right , we 're ready . Is that the cargo from Lucas 's truck ? Here it is . Lucas said to tell you sorry if he held you up , but , uh , there was something important he had to do . Yeah , yeah , whatever . Hooper . Scan this into the manifest . Let 's get moving . Hang on . Something 's not right here . Never mind . We 're good . Let 's get this cargo moving , people . 2149 awaits . My father 's going to destroy the fracture , isn 't he ? He 's going to cut this place off from 2149 . And I was so close to beating him . Mmm . To taking it all away . Yeah . Well , you win some , you lose some . And I like to win . Right this way , gentlemen . I 'm happy to report the first shipment from Terra Nova has arrived . We now have a two-way pipeline to the most plentiful world mankind has ever known . Hooper , you there ? This is Hooper . I 'm not reading you . The interference is too strong . Contact ... Plaza . Not copying you . Over . Hope Plaza is under attack . They need to power down and sever their link to the fracture . Otherwise , we could lose it for good . You have to tell them . Hooper ? - What did you do ? ! - What ? What 's happening ? The induction coils are shorted . Your men must have damaged them when they moved it . Can you fix it ? Attaboy , Malcolm . With the fracture untethered , where will Jim appear when he gets back from Hope Plaza ? Well , he 's going to end up someplace else when he comes back through , but don 't worry ... it 'll be within three klicks of right here . I 'm going to need to go back to the colony and get replacements . Well , hurry up , then . Meteoric iron , gentlemen . Back there , you can 't spit without hitting the stuff . We brought back three containers . Each one holds 30 metric tons . Gentlemen , today you 're rich . Tomorrow ... well , it 's just going to be stupid . What about the other matter we asked you to look into ? The Badlands . Yeah , we sent some people out that way . And ? Did you find anything ? As a matter of fact , we did . Why don 't you see for yourselves ? Is it coming this way ? What do we do ? It 's all clear . Go . We got a problem ... a big problem ! You there , stop ! Commander Taylor , come in . It 's Taylor . Go ahead , Skye . It 's Lucas , sir ... he got away . Where is he now ? My guess is he 's headed your way , towards the terminus . He 's on foot . Copy that . I 'm on it . Out . Hello , son . Where you heading in such a hurry ? I think we both know the answer to that . You drew blood . Didn 't think you had it in you . Think again . For the first time , I 'm glad your mother is dead . Don 't . She would be so ... ashamed of what you 've become . Don 't say that . It 's true , boy . You know it 's true . It wasn 't my fault she died . It 's not my fault she ... Your fault she ... ? Of course it wasn 't . My God , is that what you think ? Help me ... Just ... forgive me . Please . It 's not that simple . Look , you 've got to answer for what you 've done . We all do . Oh , Dad ... I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I know . You 're still my son . You 're still my b ... You arrogant fool . Do you think I care about your forgiveness ? It 's you who should be begging me for mine ! Oh , God ! Uh , don 't move . It 's bad . Lucas . I 'm sorry . Uh-uh-uh . What the hell did you do ? Weaver ... You stupid son of a bitch . Do you have any idea what you 've cost us ? ! You think you can get to your feet ? All right , here . Oh , my God , he 's gone . Still no sign of him . A fracture reopened near here . It 's gotta be close . Oh , come on , Jim . Elisabeth . I told you I 'd be back . What happened ? Hope Plaza ... it 's gone . They blew it to pieces . What are you talking about ? We 're stuck here ... forever . Maybe it 's just me , but knowing we 're cut off from the future makes this jungle seem a whole lot bigger somehow . Excuse me , Commander . Dunham . Just got a transmission from the colony . It 's Boylan . Boylan ? Boylan , this is Taylor . Hello , Commander . Good to hear your voice again . You 're taking a hell of a risk , aren 't you ? Contacting me on an unsecured frequency ? There 's no one listening . In fact , there 's no one here . All those big-spending new customers of mine ? They 're all gone . What 's that , now ? Phoenix picked up their operation and rolled out 15 minutes ago . The whole lot of ' em . Hey , thanks for the heads up . We 'll be waiting . Oh , no , not to worry . They 're not coming your way . They 're headed north . North ? Don 't ask me why . All I know is I 've got an empty bar that needs filling . So hurry home , would ya ? It 's good to see you up here ... where you belong . It 's good to be home . Those bastards left a lot of scars . Yeah . Nothing we can 't fix . Shannon , that was a hell of a thing you pulled off back in Hope Plaza . Makes me kinda glad I didn 't run your ass out the gates the day you broke into my colony . - Commander . - Reynolds . One of our RBs on the northern perimeter just spotted the Phoenix convoy . A dozen vehicles , at least a hundred men . Which way they heading ? We lost track of them . After they passed marker 33 . Looked like they were heading toward the Badlands . Badlands ? Why the hell would they go there ? There 's nothing out there . Wish I could tell you , sir . Badlands . Weaver shipped something he found out there back to Hope Plaza . At least he was going to , anyway , if we hadn 't switched out the containers . I overheard them talking about it . Did he say what it was ? Not before he got a face full of Carno . Let 's track down that container . Let 's get it out of there , see what it is . What is it ? It looks like a statue . It 's not a statue . It 's the prow of a ship . It 's old . 18th century , from the looks of it . How the hell did a ship from any century end up in the Badlands ? How did it even end up in this time period ? Well , it didn 't come through Hope Plaza , that 's for sure . However it got here , it kinda makes you wonder what else is out in the Badlands waiting for us ? What bothers me is why Phoenix headed out there the minute they realized they were cut off from 2149 . Taylor wants to keep this under wraps until we know more . And I think that 's the right way to go . That 's fine by me . To be honest with you , I don 't even want to think about what it all might mean right now . I 'm just really glad we 're safe . - Me , too . - Yeah . What are they looking at ? Hey , what are you looking at ? Maddy claims there 's a meteor shower tonight . Nothing so far , though . Maybe I got my calculations wrong . Zoe , do you want to go inside and help me run them again ? The kid 's been through enough . Wait . One 's coming . I know it . Okay ... Told you ! Oh , you called it , Zoe .

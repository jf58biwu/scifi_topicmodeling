 ( Screams ) ( Dog barks ) ( Text tone ) You 're texting again ? Huh ? Come on . Put that down and swim with me . In the ocean ? There 's fish out there . Your loss . ( Text tone ) ( Ominous music ) Oh , my God . Bree ! Bree ! Shark ! Bree ! There 's a shark ! ( Gasps ) Oh , my God ! Would somebody help her , please ? There 's a shark ! Bree ! Shark ! Oh , my God . ( Roaring ) Oh , my God . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? What just happened ? There was a shark . Oh , my God . SANDS : Welcome to Blue Water . This better be good , Sands . I stood up an admiral to be here . Trust me , Commander . You 're gonna want to see this . What are we looking at here ? S-11 's been fitted with cameras . We received these images ten minutes ago . My God . Very National Geographic , isn 't it ? Freeze it . See ? He got away . Why didn 't S-11 go after it ? Because we jerked it 's leash . We told it to behave . Come again ? Like a shark- - let me let my daughter explain . Like a shark , S-11 can sense electrical impulses helping it navigate . We manipulate its ability by transmitting focus to electrical charges , to a series of receptors implanted in S-11 's cerebral cortex . I have no idea what she just said . S-11 is now totally under our control . Blue Water Corp. has just created the Navy 's next super weapon . Sands , crafty S.O.B. You did it . Was there any doubt ? Baby girl , bring S-11 home . Sir , we 've got S-11 on an intercept path of a fast moving vessel . Change course . No , take it in closer . Commander , the swimmer was a chance encounter . S-11 still needs more testing . I procured millions of dollars of taxpayer money to develop that thing . Before Blue Water gets one more cent , I better see it perform . But the external interface is a prototype . If something were to happen- - What did you have in mind , Commander ? S-11 was designed to go where the Navy can 't right ? Sneak into hostile waters , hunt down drug runners and pirate vessels . So you want us to treat that craft like the enemy ? Move in tight and pursue without being seen . Dad ? Make me proud , pumpkin . I told you to stop calling me that . Make me proud , Nicole . Yeah , man ! ( Laughs ) You can breathe now . ( Loud snap , fizzling ) Whoa ! What is that ? ( Both yell ) What 's going on ? S-11 isn 't responding to command . The propeller must 've damaged the external interface . I told you it wasn 't ready for adverse conditions . Get the system back on line , now . It 's not working . I 'm engaging the kill switch . ( Charging ) In three ... two ... one . It 's too late , Nicole . Look . Oh , my God . What just happened ? S-11 escaped . ( Exhales ) ( Gulls calling ) So , you ever see anybody fall off one of these things ? Fall ? Nah . I seen a guy jump once though . Wife left him so he took a nose dive from 60 floors up . That 's horrible . It 's so bad . Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Feel the wind in your hair . Splat ! ( Laughs ) It 's all over with . I can think of worse ways to go anyhow . Like what ? Like falling face first in a French fryer . ( Sizzles ) Thanks . I 'll have that image in my head all day . How about getting jammed into a wood chipper ? Whoa . Oh , no ! Not like this ! ( Screams ) Signals from the tracking implant are fading , but it looks like S-11 's heading south . Commander . You just unleashed an eight-legged man-eating shark on the world . A minor setback . If you 're thinking of going back into that lab , and creating a new freak , forget it . I 'm cutting off all Blue Water funding until you get S-11 back . You fail , and that 's not all I 'll cut off . Relax , Commander . We 'll get S-11 . Even if we have to go to the ends of the Earth . Okay , telemetry shows he 's heading to Mexico . Let 's get a team down there now . Any changes ? Hard to say . The tracking implant was damaged when S-11 ripped off its control plate . But we 're still receiving ghost signals indicating S-11 's presence in the coastal waters . Can we pinpoint its location ? Not exactly , Dr. Sands . But S-11 is here , and for some reason it 's sticking around . Migratory instincts . It 'll feed along the coast a few days then move on . This is it , sir . We 're here ? I chartered us more craft . Two for the recovery mission . A fast one , I hope . It will do the job , sir . Good . Sir , I think we should also contact Andy Flynn . Flynn ? He 's here in Mexico ? Since you let him go two years ago . I didn 't let him go , Santos . I fired his ass . 'Cause he demanded a raise , a big one . He 's a greedy bastard , no doubt . But he knows these waters better than anyone . And he knows what we 're up against . If you want S-11 back , Andy Flynn is your best shot . Ah . All right . Find him . ( Background chatter ) Who 's ready for some tequila ball ? ( Speaking Spanish ) You missed ! Let 's go , ladies . There you go . Andy Flynn . Still drinking their vodka , huh ? Santos ! What 's up , brother ? What 're you doing here ? Looking for you . No , you didn 't . Blue Water wants you back . Not a chance , man . Not a chance . If it 's about the money- - Look , it 's always about the money . All right ? That idiot Sands , he won 't pay me what I 'm worth . So , I 'm retired . Not any more , amigo . S-11 escaped . ( Metal detector beeps ) ( Detects metal ) ( Gasps , screams ) Please help me ! Please ! No ! Please ! Please ! ( Screams ) ( Screams ) SANDS : Hey , Guys . So glad you could join us , Mr. Flynn . Do we have a location ? No . But like an octopus , he 's very territorial . They won 't stray far . You understand you are to capture S-11 , not terminate it , right ? Well , your fish might have other ideas . S-11 can be controlled , Mr. Flynn . Let me show you . We call these interface darts . Once attached , I can access S-11 's higher implants with my computer , allowing me to direct its movements . Like a remote control toy . Sounds easy . It won 't be easy , believe me . First , we have to tranquilize S-11 . That 'll make him docile . And then he won 't resist commands . The tranqs will bring S-11 to the surface , and then we can hit it with the interface dart . Why don 't we just nail it underwater with your dart ? They 're more accurate if shot from a grenade launcher . And since we only have two darts , accuracy is key . Once I establish a link , I can then navigate S-11 to open waters and our techs on the yacht will be able to fix the interface . So , what do you say ? You game ? Yeah . 100 grand , 200 more upon completion , why not ? You think a great deal of yourself , don 't you , Flynn ? Yeah , you know what I think ? I think you 're a money-grubbing Neanderthal . And the word on you is , you like cheap women and cheaper booze . That right ? 300 grand , or I go back to the pool . Fine , 300 grand . But only if you bring S-11 back alive . Otherwise , you get nothing . This is a bad idea , Sands . We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives . That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering . Damage it , and head will roll , Mr. Flynn . Yours will be first . Fine . Get your stuff ready . We 're going to the boat . Santos and I will meet you at the dock . Donde esta Senor Kingsberry ? Ay , yi , yi . Classy . You Kingsberry ? Well , the locals call me Pez . What can I do for you , angel ? First , Pez , you can stop staring at my rack . They 're just boobs . They 're not gonna get up and dance or anything . Second ... you can tell me about this . How 'd you find me ? It 's what I do . I 'm Stacy Everheart . An investigative reporter with CNE . And this is my cameraman Bones . Hey , buddy . You sent that to our station two days ago . It- - it was a joke . A joke . That 's right . Oh , we like jokes . Sorry to waste your time . You 're lying . A creature fitting this description was sighted just last week in California . Now it 's in Vallarta , and you 've seen it . Well I wish to the devil I hadn 't . I can 't close my eyes without imagining that- - that thing squirming towards me . It 's gotten so bad , I can 't take my boat out . No , I 'm done with that thing . There 's nothing you can- - What do you wanna know ? I 'll bite , Pez . Can we stop ? Come on . We gotta burn off those enchiladas from last night . But we 're on vacation and it 's Mexico . I think it 's against the law to jog in Mexico . Fine . You 're gonna have to save your breath anyway . You 'll be screaming your lungs out soon . Wait . Why ? Two words : Bungee jumping . I found a great spot over the ocean . So not funny . You know I 'm afraid of heights . Gonna have to get over that sooner or later . Today 's the day . All right , tell you what . Do this , spend the rest of the day at the spa . Mud baths . Seaweed wraps ? Sure . Okay , you 're on . ( Yells ) ( Laughing ) Yes ! Nice ! Babe , that was awesome . I can 't believe I did it ! Who 's afraid of heights now , huh ? Not my girl . Wait , I wanna go again . Wild child . Vamos ! ( Yells ) ( Laughs ) Whoo ! ( Growls ) It 's gonna be like old times , Santos . Yep . It 's gonna be like old times . She 's got a sexy little brain going , you ever notice that ? Don 't even think it , Bro . Oh , what ? I 'm just gonna talk to her . I heard that before , Remember in Cairo ? The lady snake charmer with cobras ? Cairo , come on . My level check went black , Flynn . Almost fell off . So , you miss me ? Excuse me ? You might 've noticed I took a little hiatus from Blue Water . By hiatus , you mean my father fired you . Yeah . I did notice , Mr. Flynn . Look , call me Andy . Oh , all right . Let 's just get this over with so I can get back to work . Give me your best line . Okay . Um , here . What ? Souvenir from Bagdad . Piece of shrapnel from an IED . Went in back here , played ping-pong with my insides . If it weren 't for Santos over there , I probably wouldn 't have made it . So I have him to blame . Look , I remember you too , Nicole , all right ? Spent your whole life in that lab . First one there , last one to leave . And I get it . That was me once . My whole life was work . Thanks to this little guy , it looked like there was no tomorrow . So , that 's my line . What do you think ? Being first in the lab earned me a doctorate from MIT and made me one of the best biomechanical engineers in the country . I care about what I do , Mr. Flynn . As for you , you 're a mercenary . That says it all . Hmm . Okay . That smooth savvy , huh ? Oh , shut up . ( Techno pop plays ) Okay , if that didn 't get your booty shaking , have somebody check your pulse , 'cause you might be dead . I 'm Captain Jack and this is PV Pirate Radio , the spring break destination . Just in case they 're listening , I wanted to give a special shout out to the FCC , 'cause those are the boys who kicked my ass out of America . And boys , you have doomed me to a life filled with sandy beautiful beaches , smoking hot senoritas and ice cold pina coladas . You sure taught me a lesson . Folks , I may never leave here . ( Shuts off mic ) God , I hate it here . You 're kidding me , right ? I mean this place is amazing . Yeah , whatever . And what is it with all this ? What do you call it ? Sunshine ? Yes . Sunshine . Enough with the freaking sun already . ( Text tone ) It 's annoying . What do you got here ? Tell you in a sec . You are live in five . Hey , party people , it 's Captain Jack . And you are listening to PV Pirate Radio . First mate Stephie has just handed me some breaking news . Apparently a half shark , half octopus has been sighted off the coast two miles south of Playa Del Sol . According to sources , it is armed and dangerous . Yes , it 's half octopus . It 'd be eight-armed and dangerous , right ? Oh . Stephanie apparently is hitting the tequila a little early today and she 's not sharing with her captain . I always share with you . Yeah . So what is this , Stephae ? This some mad experiment gone horribly wrong ? Maybe they 're doing a movie . Oh , yeah . I could see that now . A former Navy Seal slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives . I 'd watch it . Yeah , I know you would , Stephanie . That 's because you 're easily amused . I 've seen you mesmerized watching a frozen burrito rotate in a microwave oven . Let 's get back to the music , shall we ? Coming up next , it 's the Cheetah Horse , Very hot band out of New York City . Here is their latest hit . It 's called " Hot Rod Hell Kitten . " Meow . ( Starts music ) ( Yells ) What 're you doing with this stuff ? ( Hard rock plays ) Well , this is it . Nice view , huh ? Yeah , yeah . Breathtaking . There . Thank you . Hook me up ? Not a chance . Aw , you 're no fun . So what makes you think it 'll come back here ? When you spend your days gutting fish , you learn a thing or two about marine life . ( Hocks , spits ) Hard to believe you 're still single . Would 've thought some lucky lady would 've snapped you up by now . As I was saying , octopi are very territorial . He 'll be back . NICOLE : Santos , take it 20 miles south and stop by the rocks . Let me see that thing . Easy bro . Those pierce inject enough MS-222 to put a bull shark to sleep . But it can 't bring down S-11 ? NICOLE : S-11 's metabolism is higher than a typical shark . Tranqs just make it more meetable . Kind of like you an tequila , huh ? I got a signal . It 's two miles south of here . Yeah , I know the place . Resorts all over the area . ( Line ringing ) - Dad ? We got a signal . - Yes , Nicole ? I don 't have to tell you what 's at stake here , pumpkin . I told you to stop calling me that . I 'm counting on you , Nicole . Bring S-11 home . Okay , Stacy , in three , two . Stacy Everheart here with local fisherman Ryan Kingsberry . Uh , it 's Pez . All right , Pez . Can you tell us what you saw ? Well , I first saw the creature coming in from out there chasing a charter . I thought it was a shark at first , and then I saw the tentacles . And black soulless eyes like my third wife 's . Cut . What are you doing ? Are you high , or just that stupid ? Holy crap ! ( Background chatter ) Hey , hey , hey . Hey ! PEZ : Hey ! Get out of the water ! Get out of there ! Inhale . Exhale . Break left ! Hola , senorita . You wanna play ? Not really . Hey , what 's the hold up ? Got it ! ( Yells , gurgling ) Mark ! ( Gurgling ) ( Roars ) ( Beachgoers screaming ) Are you getting this ? Yes ! Yes ! ( Yelling ) ( Roars , screams ) ( Screaming continues ) ( Screams ) STACY : Get out of there ! ( Roars , screams ) Is it over yet ? STACY : Um , not quite . ( Moans ) PEZ : Oh , this ain 't happening . That was horrible . Sure . Sure . Horrible . Come on , let 's go . atic music ) Dammit ! Lost the signal ! What ? I lost the signal . S-11 's gone . Dammit ! You sure that thing works ? I told you the tracer got damaged when S-11 escaped . Great . So we 're chasing ghosts out here . I don 't think so . We sure our freak did that ? The abrasions on his body are tentacle markings . Why it didn 't eat him ? Maybe he wasn 't hungry . Oh , keen insight . So glad you came along . Tell me something , Ms. Sands , what do you know ? I know octopi like big rocks . Sir ? What is it ? There 's something on TV I think you should see . ( Clears throat ) Stacy , my crew and I captured this footage an hour ago around Playa Del Sol- - So far , only CNE is carrying this . And that 's supposed to make me feel any better ? STACY : The creature appeared to be some hybrid of shark and octopus . A sharktopus if you will . Hell . STACY : As you can see , the creature is like nothing ever witnessed before , and neither is its vitality . There 's no confirmation by authorities yet , but fatalities are certain . Dr. Sands ? You 've got an incoming call on satellite link . It 's Commander Cox . All right . Patch him in . Stacy Everheart reporting . Wait . First bring me a great , big , enormous scotch . Three and neat , sir ? Yeah . Got it . What 's going on ? Why did we come ashore ? Let 's get away from your Dad 's Eagle Scouts so you can tell me what the hell you 're hiding . What are you talking about ? S-11 's killing at random . Why ? I told you , I have no idea . Look , even I know sharks aren 't serial killers . Okay ? They kill for a purpose . And Octopi ? Pfft . Smart as hell . And not to mention stealthy . Okay , so they 're not gonna expose themselves unless they 've got a damn good reason not to . Maybe our neural implants are damaging the impulse controls in S-11 's brain . Or maybe your father did something to that freak . Something you don 't know about . You know , a little gene splicing behind closed doors ? No , he wouldn 't do that . Not without consulting me first . My father is a man of science . How ' bout you tell that to the dead guy out there ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It means that I think your dad intended S-11 to succeed at all costs . Blue Water didn 't hire you to think . Hired you to do a job . And if you can 't do it , we 'll find someone who can . Get Tom on the phone . Look , I don 't care if he 's in a meeting . Tell him Stacy Everheart wants to talk to him now . Thank you . Yup . I 'm watching the recap right now . So what 'd the networks say ? TOM : Dan Everett is replacing you , Stacy . - What ? - I 'm sorry . But that 's the decision they 've made . But it 's my story . Hey , Stacy ! TOM : I hope you understand , all right ? No . I understand . Fine . ( Hangs up ) Rat bastards are sending in another reporter to take the lead . What ? What is this ? Pez figured out the places of attacks . Show me . This is where I first spotted the creature , this was the attack on the bungee tower , and this was the attack on the resort . So it 's sticking to the coast heading south . Yeah . What are we supposed to do ? Just head south and hope we run into it ? Worth a shot , and maybe we can get some more footage . Then the network would have to make us the leads . You know , I bet we could cover a lot more miles by boat . Fine . But you 're gonna double my salary , and you 're gonna pay for my car . Oh , Pez , I could just hug you right now . I mean , if you were better looking and had better hygiene . Oh , what the hell . Pez ! Sorry . Lock and load , boys . Time to get wet . ( Shuts off engine ) Oh , you got the helm , brother . You better watch your back down there . No , watching my back is your job . I don 't know . Am I in your will ? You get my dog . You don 't have a dog . Ah . ( Laughs ) Hey , remember . My dad doesn 't want S-11 harmed , all right ? And we always do what daddy says , don 't we ? Relax , I 've got 300 thousand reasons to bring that thing back in one piece . We stick to the plan , tranq it , force it to the surface , then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo , and you guys jockey it back to your yacht , if your gear really works . Yeah , it does work . So make sure you don 't miss . I haven 't yet . Now I 'm ready . Patch him in . Guess what I just saw on CNE ? S-11 looks impressive on TV , doesn 't he , Commander ? Are you drinking ? Yes , I am . Scotch . Good scotch . Dammit , Sands . You said you could handle this . Listen , if you can 't handle- - No , Commander , you listen . The Navy said they wanted a killing machine . That 's exactly what I gave them . And yes , the civilian deaths are a tragedy . But greatness comes at a price . It always has . Just capture that freak before it shows up on TV again . If the media links this to the Navy , we 're screwed . Don 't worry , Commander . I 've got my best man on it . Don 't worry . Flynn can take care of himself . Worried ? Why would I be worried ? No reason . Hey , do me a favor . Stay out of my business and focus on the shooting . All right ? Yes , ma 'am . ( Ominous music ) ( Growls ) What is that ? Ink . Oh , God , no . ( Groans ) Santos ! He 's right behind me . FLYNN : He caught me in the leg . Did you try and kill it ? No . It pulled it out of it 's hide . What about the others ? They 're gone . They 're dead . So what makes you think we 'll spot it out here ? I don 't know , but if you 've got a better idea , I 'm all ears . No , no , you 're the captain . Nice yacht , by the way . Bite me . ( Groans ) What do you think ? Two or three stitches ? This is nothing . Remember that go-go dancer in Bangkok ? Crazy chick nearly bit your pinky toe off . SANTOS : Now that was bad . And I have no idea where that thing came from . It 's like it knew we were coming . That 's what sharks do , amigo . No , this wasn 't pure instinct , this was a planned attack . Is that mine ? Damn it . You better not have any diseases . Yeah , well , burns when I urinate . Shouldn 't be concerned , should I ? ( Phone rings ) Oh , there 's Daddy . Dad ? Yeah , it escaped and the tracer went dead again . Is that your dad ? Tell him I miss him . Is that Flynn ? Yeah , he 's still in shock from the blood loss . Can he continue the mission ? He 'll be fine . And the others , they- - they weren 't so lucky . They knew the risks , Nicole . Dad , S-11 is a killer , and they 're random . It 's not even feeding on its victims . Dad ? I had the tech boys make some adjustments to S-11 's subroutines . You altered my programming ? S-11 was a hunter . We needed a killer . So we enhanced his aggressiveness . But Dad , I designed the bio-ware . I should 've been consulted . This isn 't right . It 's time for you to grow up , baby girl . Our feelings are irrelevant . Right now all that matters is getting S-11 back . Am I clear ? Are you with me ? - Yes . - Good . Now bring S-11 home , baby girl . Did he ask about me ? Can you move on that thing ? Why ? Wanna go dancing later ? Do you always make asinine jokes when men have died ? Look , what do you want from me ? I want you to do your damn job and capture S-11 . Okay . You heard the woman , fire it up . Where are we headed ? South . FLYNN : I 'm pulling up behind them to get their attention . We gotta get them out of here . Hey ! Leave ! Hey ! This is a restricted area ! Can you hear them ? I can 't hear what they 're saying . This is a restricted area ! Bones , get on the clock . Something 's going on . Please go ! They 're not listening . They 'll listen to this . ( Gunfire ) Keep filming . What 're you doing ? I didn 't sign up to get shot . That 's my story you 're running away from . I 'm getting the hell out of here . Hey ! You crazy bitch ! ( Screams ) Oh , my God . ( Crunching , chewing ) Your dad 's gonna have to settle for damaged goods . ( Gunfire ) ( Screams ) ( Sharktopus shrieks ) FLYNN : It 's heading away from the rocks ! I 'm gonna run that bastard down . Santos ! Take the helm ! I 'm gonna take a shot at it ! SANTOS : Got it ! Santos ! I 'm on it ! Damn ! in music ) How about that one ? All right , man . Perfect . To the boat mast ! Loser gets the tequila ! Let 's do it ! What are these morons doing ? Hey , you 're a little close , huh ? MAN : What 're you doing ? ( Laughs ) What is this ? An amusement park to you ? I 'm trying to fish here ! Hey ! Hey , Maria ! I can 't believe this ! What 's going on , honey ? Bunch of stupid punks . ( Revs engine ) ( Revs engine ) ( Screams ) ( All talking ) Dios mio . Tequila 's on you guys , and I 'm super thirsty . Where 's Bob ? I don 't know . He was just right behind you . Hey , something just touched my leg . What was that ? ( Screams ) Ed ! Ed ! Hey , Eddie ! Ed ! ( Screams ) ( Crunching ) I 've been horrible to you this whole time . You don 't deserve it . Sorry , Flynn . It 's Andy . Andy ? There 's something I need to tell you . ( Muffled conversation ) Got it . Gracias , Miguel . What ? Oh , nothing . What 'd you find out ? The power boat was rented by some Blue Water Corporation . Some shady genetics engineering firm , knee deep in defense department contracts . Enough cash to go all Frankenstein and create our fish . That 's great . What is wrong with you ? Were you a lawyer in a past life ? Or no , maybe you worked at the DMV . Do you feel nothing , Stacy ? That guy was killed right in front of us inches away . Inches away ! Gosh . He was kind of nice guy , you know ? Smell a little funky , but he was okay . Now he 's dead . And that 's tragic truly . But the story of a lifetime is right out that door . And we can find it thanks to Pez 's map ! No . Oh , come on , Bones . He would 've wanted it this way . Don 't let his death mean nothing . You are so full of crap . I know , but you 're coming with me anyway . Hell not . Your father did what ? Altered S-11 's neural implants disrupting serotonin levels . Making it more aggressive . That explains all the random attacks . You know what I gave up to be my dad 's perfect little scientist ? Then he goes and does this behind my back . I 'm sorry , Nicole . What can I say ? That 's my dad . I love him . ( Sonar beeps ) Flynn ! It 's the tracking device on my computer . S-11 's near . Do you mind telling us the plan ? We 've been one step behind that freak all day . Time to cut it off . ( Text tone ) You aren 't gonna believe this . What ? ( Sighs ) You 're finally ready to admit you 're attracted to me ? Thank God . The sexual tension was unbearable . Ew . Gross . God . You ? All right , easy . A simple no would 've sufficed . The Captain has feelings , you know ? All right , Jack , there has been another sighting of this creature and now supposedly CNE is running footage of it . Really . Wow . How gullible do you think I am ? Look , this isn 't a joke . I swear . Just , please , warn the audience . Okay , I 'll warn them . Attention all hands . This is your Captain speaking . We 're getting more reports about this half shark , half octopus creature that 's terrorizing the coast . But please do not panic . There is a way we can stop this thing . Virgin sacrifices . Yes , the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me , the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin . Preferably , 18 to 25 years old . I repeat ! Sharktopus wants our virgins ! So , all prospective candidates please email me your photos , preferably nudes , to Captain Jack I wish there was another way , I 'm sorry.This is our only hope . Damn you , Sharktopus ! ( Laughs ) ( Switches music back on ) Oh , what ? Don 't look at me like that . How can you live with yourself ? So you 're not punking me on this thing ? No . Stephie , this has to be a hoax , okay ? It 's gotta be . There 's no way a shark-octopus fishy thingy really exists . Well I hope you 're right . Trust me , okay ? There is no such thing as a Sharktopus . ( Screams ) ( Yelling ) ( Growls ) ( Scream echoes ) Gotta love these Mexican roads . Where are we ? Please . Just keep your eyes on the road . Driving with you , you kill us before Sharktopus does . ( Reel spins ) Honey , why don 't we go back to the resort ? Not until I hook a fish . You still worried about that shark we saw ? It wasn 't a shark . Look , babe , relax . It 's a big ocean . No matter what it was , we 're not gonna see it again . ( Light splash ) ( Whistles ) What are we doing here ? We 're two miles off the last signal . Check your map . You 'll notice the distance between the S-11 's attacks are nearly equal . How did you figure this out ? Back at Los Arcos . I wasn 't sure . And now you are ? Nope , but I 'm sick and tired of chasing the freak around all day , so , if I 'm right , it 'll come to us . You 're in no condition for diving . I wasn 't planning on it . We can lure S-11 to the surface without using the tranqs . And how do we do that ? Ugh . What ? Ever see five gallons of fish guts before ? ( Reel spins ) Whoa ! Come here . Good ! Did you get a fish ? Come on . ( Grunts ) Come on ! Come on . Come on . Come on ! ( Grunts ) Ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Got you . I can 't believe you bought that . Estupido ! Oh , estupido ? How about now ? How ' bout now , honey ? No ! No ! How ' bout now , honey ? Huh ? Huh ? How about now ? ( Both screaming ) ( Screams ) Kevin ! Kevin , where are you ? ( Yelling ) Where are you ? Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Kevin ! ( Growls , screams ) Oh , my God ! ( Screams ) ( Growling ) ( Screaming ) Flynn ! SANTOS : Over there ! Get us over there . No . The chum 's working . S-11 is coming to us . ( Sonar signal ) S-11 has gone off the grid . The software is glitching . Man . Lost the signal . ( Yells , screams ) - No ! - Santos ! NICOLE : Santos ! ( All yelling ) Help me ! Please ! Please ! Do it , man ! Damn you , you freak ! Shoot it with the dart ! Shoot it with the dart ! I can 't , it 's jammed ! Don 't let go ! Don 't let go ! Don 't let go ! Don 't let go ! ( Crunching , yelling ) No ! Santos ! No ! ( Gasps ) ( Yells ) ( Crunching ) ( Screams , growls ) ( Groans ) No ! ( Panting ) ( Dramatic music ) Andy . It knew we 're setting up an ambush . It knew . What 're you doing ? What I should 've done from the beginning . ( Starts engine ) Take the wheel ! Get that ! ( Both yelling ) Where is it ? I don 't know . It was right in front of us . Check the trace . Whoa ! You okay ? Yeah . Andy ! Look ! It 's heading for the resort ! Great . ( Engine sputters ) ANDY : It must 've damaged the propellers . No , no . Dammit ! ( Phone rings ) Nicole ? What 's happening ? S-11 just killed Santos . It 's moving ashore . Has it been harmed ? What ? Has S-11 been harmed ? Listen to me , you arrogant bastard , Santos was my best friend , all right ? Emotion is blinding , Mr. Flynn . It 's bigger than Santos . It 's bigger than you . Yeah , I 'll think about that when I 'm drowning your freaking bullets . I have one million dollars that says you won 't do that . One million to bring S-11 back to me . What do you say ? What do you say ? Keep your money . Sir , we 've got Commander Cox on the satellite link again . Ah . ( Blows raspberry ) Patch him in . What 's the news , Sands ? Did you catch our fish yet ? It 's my fish . And we 're closing in on it . Not good enough . You need to bag that thing now . If you can 't do it , I 'll send a team in to terminate it . Oh , shut up . It can be there in an hour . Turn that freak of yours into chowder and leave no sign that it ever existed . Shut up ! Sands . Cut him off . Cut him off ! - What 's going on ? - Son of a witch ! Find a place to dock this thing . - Sir ? - Move ! Contact Briggs . Tell him to get a car ready . Go ! ANDY : The engine 's toast . All she 's got left . Come on . Come on , baby . You can make it . Andy , wait . Talk to me . I am done talking . ( Crowd cheering ) FEMALE HOST : Ladies and gentlemen , presenting the Purple Mianta Dancers ! ( Applause ) Tell me we can find them . Yes , sir . We 're tracking the GPS on your daughter 's computer . Honestly , Mr. Sands , I don 't think that 's gonna be enough to stop S-11 . It 's not for S-11 . Which way ? ( Growling ) ( Growls ) Is that part of the show ? I don 't know . Cool , dad . Look . Oh , my God ! ( Screaming ) ( Growls ) ( Screaming , crunching ) ( Screaming ) Oh , man ! That way . ( Yelling ) Dude , that 's awesome . ( Screaming ) Move ! Move ! ( Yelling ) ( Screams ) Eat this , Bastard . ( Gunfire ) ( Sharktopus moans ) ( Growls ) You can 't hide . I 'll find you . Dammit . Where does this channel lead ? Where are you going ? I might be able to head it off before it reaches the river . Okay , once up river it- - It should pass by here . Check the trace . Come on , come on . There 's no signal . Dammit . What about them ? Excuse me . Excuse me , everyone . There 's a killer shark octopus hybrid headed this way . So please , leave the marina in a timely fashion . MAN : What 're you talking about ? No . No ? Okay , how about this ? ( Gunfire ) ( Yelling ) You enjoyed that way too much . It worked , didn 't it ? Mr. Flynn . Tell me , Mr. Flynn , when did you become such a people person ? Dad ? What 're you doing ? Last chance for you to reconsider my offer . Or what ? Your boys gonna shoot me down ? What 's your life compared to a miracle of science ? Dad , don 't do this . Baby girl , my SUV is in the parking lot . Go wait for me there . No . I 'm not your little girl anymore . Andy 's right . S-11 needs to be put down . You don 't know what you 're saying . S-11 's a crime against nature . We went too far . It can be controlled , baby . You know that . At what price ? How many more lives are you going to sacrifice ? What about my life ? Oh , baby . S-11 is my creation . Mine . I dedicated my entire life to it . I will not allow anyone to destroy it . Not even you . ( Tracer signal ) What ? Dad , it 's here . ( Growling ) ( Gunfire ) ( Grunting ) ( Yelling ) No ! No ! ( Gun jams ) NICOLE : Oh , my God ! ( Growls ) ( Screaming ) No ! No ! God help me ! ( Gunfire ) No ! ( Growling ) Oh ! Dad ! ( Screams ) ( Yells ) ( Growls ) NICOLE : Dad ! Nicole ... - Dad ! - Nicole . Kill- - Kill- - Dad ? You can still- - What ? I love you , pumpkin . No . I 'm sorry , Nicole . I 've gotta go after it . Someone will come for you . Andy , wait . This is the place . You say that the last three stops . This map is useless . We should call it quit for today . We call it quits we I say we call it quits . Hey , it 's the guy from the speed boat . The one following Sharktopus . Come on . All right , the river narrows a few miles south , so we just need to get a pair of wheels . All right . I 'm Stacy Everheart with CNE . Can you tell- - Get out- - get out of my face , lady . What connection do you have to the creature known as the Sharktopus ? Are you employed by the Blue Water Corporation ? You got a car ? Yeah . Gimmie the keys . You 're going after that thing , aren 't you ? Take me with you , and you can use my van . No . Then have fun walking . Gotta love Mexican roads , huh ? What 're you planning ? The river bottlenecks upstream . I 'll cut it off there . What about my story ? No names , no interviews . Then what the hell do I get ? Exclusive footage of Sharktopus getting shot to hell . MAN : Hey ! Yeah ! Whoo ! Hey , guys . Can I get you anything ? ( Growls ) Chad ! Be careful ! Not too close to the edge ! Whoo hoo ! ( Growls ) ( Yelling ) Help me ! ( Screams ) Help me , please ! Somebody please help me ! Chad ! Chad ! Chad ! Oh , my God ! ( All screaming ) ( Screaming ) ANDY : Looks like we 're late to the party . I 've got no bullets left and we 're out of grenades . You could use this . Nicole , we 're past that . Wait . Hear me out . S-11 has a kill switch . Explosives laced into its neural implants . But the switch became inoperable when S-11 was damaged . Then what good is it ? My dad . I think he was trying to tell me something . I think I can access the kill switch from my computer . Bones . Bones . - What ? - I think it 's over there . Come on , let 's go . But only if we establish a link with the interface dart . We 're gonna blow up S-11 's brains . But we can only establish a link if we get close enough to the interface dart and S-11 . Okay . So in other words , what you 're trying to say is that I 've gotta tag that mother with an interface dart , and you gotta be close enough to blow it to hell ? Yeah . It 's the plan . Better than no plan . Please help me find my son ! He 's missing ! Calm down . What 's his name ? Mom ! I got him . Stay here . Calm down , okay ? Please . ( Sobbing ) I can not believe that you didn 't get that shot . I am sick of your attitude . You know what ? I 'm tired about you . I 'm tired about the work . And um- - just go on your way and I 'm going my way . Fine . CHAD : Mom ! ( Sobbing ) Chad . Chad , come here . Come to me , buddy . It 's okay . Come on . Trust me , it 's okay . Chad , come on . Come to me . It 's all right . Give me your hand . There you go , there you go . Yeah , let 's go , buddy . I got you . Yeah . Yeah , come here . I got you . I got you . Let 's go . ( Sobbing ) Chad ! Here . It 's the last one , so you better not miss . I 've been missing all day and I 'm getting tired of it . Go over there . It 'll be safer . No . I 'm staying with you . Nicole , go over there and get your mojo ready . I 'm gonna draw it to you . Go ! Bones ! Bones , where the hell are you ! God . Oh , my God . ( Low growl ) ( Growling ) STACY : Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , my God . ( Screaming ) ( Choking ) ( Howls ) Got you , you mother . ( Growls ) ( Growls ) Nicole ! Nicole , hurry ! ANDY : Nicole ! I got it ! Anytime now , Nicole ! Oh , Dad , what did you do ? ( Roars ) I hope you choke on me , you freak . NICOLE : Come on ! Oh , my God . ( Yelling ) Hold on . Oh , Dad . ANDY : Nicole ! Okay ! I got it ! ( Growling ) ( Panting ) NICOLE : Impressive . You need help ? I 'll live . That thing better not jump out at us again . No . That only happens in the movies . ( Laughs ) Yeah . ( Surf music )

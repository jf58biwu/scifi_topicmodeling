 You 're safe . You 're safe . You came into my house and stole from me , and I will respond in kind . Someone 's been getting in and out and stealing artifacts . Why are you trying to hide it from us ? You 're the one cutting me off from the people that I care about . Okay . Okay , good . He has not found you yet . Now ... You . How did you get into my ware- - DB Cooper 's ripcord . Surely my resourcefulness doesn 't surprise you . - I wonder what this does . - No ! Oh , man , I hate that damn alarm . It 's never a drill , is it ? It 's in Ressler / Brooks . You know what I want . Use the astrolabe . - No . - Undo what you 've done . No , never . You can 't kill me . You need me alive . True , but I can kill your friends . No . They haven 't done anything . This is between us ! - He 's here ! - Hold on , Artie ! We 're almost there ! Come here . I wanna tell you my plan . No ! Artie ! - That way . - Artie , are you okay ? He used DB Copper 's ripcord ! - That 's how he got in ! - He 's gone now . Are you hurt ? - Should we call Dr. Vanessa ? - No , no ! No , I don 't want her anywhere near this place , not after what he said to me . Wha--wait . Wha--what did he say ? - Pete , the boomerang . - That 's weird . Why would he say ... Pete ! He said that he would punish all of you , and then he said this time we wouldn 't be able to stop him . â™ª All right . I 've alerted Mrs. Frederic and the Regents to this latest breach . Good , so no more secrets . No more secrets . I can 't stop him alone . I 'm gonna need all your help . So Mrs. F is on her way here ? No , she 's with Steve on a special assignment . 'Cause that always works out so well . Bad news . When Brother Adrian sent out Alice 's mirror , I grabbed the shipping account number . It traced to a bogus address , obviously , but I set up a system to notify me if it got used again . We just got another hit . No , wait , two . Where the packages were sent . Yuma , Arizona , and Colorado Springs , Colorado . - Amanda . - Tracy . Your pregnant sister ? - Yeah . - Oh , look , there 's a third hit . Menlo Park , California . Menlo Park ? Who do we know ? We don 't know anyone in Menlo Park . I do , but I 'm not supposed to talk about it . Claud , we need to know who 's in danger . - Joshua . - Your brother is in Menlo Park ? He 's working on a classified project . So your brother , your sister , and my ex-wife . And that 's how he 's punishing you all . He 's going after the ones you love , and this is my fault . No , no , this is not your fault , Artie , okay ? We can fix this . Claud , what artifacts did he send ? I- - I don 't believe this . According to the database , none are missing--zero . He must have disabled it . All right , I gotta go help Amanda . I 'm going to Tracy 's . Permission to save my brother ? Go . Save . I 'll stay with Leena . We 'll lock up the breach . And we will find the good brother . I must ask what happened to the needle on the elevator dial . Uh , Mrs. Frederic , uh , you were saying about the whole- - about our last campaign . Oh , Father Domenico , your cup is safely locked in the Warehouse . Only a trained eye could detect the dent . Dent ? I 'm not the one who dropped it . We have several questions about the Brotherhood of the Black Diamond . One of its members has infiltrated- - Please . The Vatican does not involve itself in disputes between ancient organizations . Oh , really ? Well , it seems to me the Vatican is pretty much at the center of all- - Thank you , Father Domenico . We 'll take it from here . I 'm assuming this is the library . If you don 't mind . Oh . I shall leave you now . May God be with you . Agent Jinks , if there is any trouble , I shall rely on your ATF training . They confiscated my weapon . How did you get this in here ? No one touches my purse . Claudia made that for you . Wow , this is so cool . Did she- - Agent Jinks , time 's a-wasting . This place is a mess . And the food is moldy . This newspaper is dated four months ago . Oh , looks like they left in a hurry . And I would hazard a guess ... They actually didn 't know they were leaving . Oh , my God ! What are you doing here ? Well , I got a sudden urge to see my little sister . I 'll call you right back . I 'm so excited ! So good to see you . Oh ! Ooh ! Oh ! - What was that ? - Whoa ! Static electricity , I think . We just got new hypoallergenic carpet installed for the baby , but that was a big one . Yeah , your eyes , they- - - Yeah ? - You know what , never mind . Just let me get a look at you ! You look great . Is that a new necklace ? Oh , it--it was a gift from Kevin last Christmas . Good . How is Kevin ? In Denver , on business again . - Good , so he 's safe . - Safe ? From all the crazy sister fun that we 're gonna have ! Aah , I know ! Oh , oh , you have to see the baby 's room . Good . - Come on . - Yeah , okay . I 'm coming . I 'm coming . Trace , it 's beautiful . Got one or two neat gifts . Wow ! Wow ! So a lot of new things have shown up in your life recently . Still popular , just like in high school . Yeah . Hey , you want some chai tea ? Sure . We--we can catch up . I 'll just be here admiring your gifts ! Check out the sweater set . It 's the cutest thing ever . - This could be it . - What ? I said that I , uh- - I love sweater sets ! No . No , no , no ! What ? I-I can 't believe that it 's this cute ! Oh , God . Oh , this tea has ginger and catnip . I got it off a website for pregnant women , Greenbaby.org. Everyone said I would be throwing up the first three months . No . But I haven 't even been queasy ! I think it 's the catnip . Oh , I feel awful , so I 'm assuming that your showing up here is not a coincidence . Probably not . Look , I 'm sorry , Amanda , but it looks like we 're dealing with a little bit more - of the old , you know- - - Boogedy-boogedy . Great . What is it this time ? I 'm not really sure , but are you okay ? I 'm feeling worse by the minute . Yeah , you do look a little sweaty . Hmm . Thank you . I was going for sweaty . Hoping for puffy later . Okay , um , Amanda , have you received any- - I don 't know- - weird packages today ? Yeah , actually , that little leather box over there arrived this morning . There was no return address , so I assumed it was from Michael . He 's in Florence now . And you touched it ? Yes , that is what humans do when packages are sent to them . Right . It made it through the base 's security , so I figured it was all right . Was it always empty like this ? Yeah , just the box . Pete , am I gonna be all right ? Yeah . I 'm here , okay ? We 're gonna fix it . I never really thought of you as the fix-it guy . You were always much more the break-it kinda guy . I know , right ? I mean , who 'd have thought my life would get weirder after I quit drinking ? All right , watch your eyes . Nothing . Do you--do you feel better ? Oh ! I 'll take that as a no . Josh ? Joshua ? Josh ? It 's Claudia . I-I keep calling your phone , but it just keeps ... ringing . Oh , crap . Artie ? Oh , Leena . Thank God . I was worried about you . Artie , what are you doing ? Something that I should have done weeks ago . There has to be some other way to- - There isn 't . No more games . I won 't let him hurt anybody else . Next time that I see him , I 'll be ready . Wait , well , at least let me just come- - Leena ! Leena , thank God . Artie won 't answer , and Josh- - Joshua is frozen in some kind of weird amber-like substance . What do you think it is ? Amber . Can you check the database ? On it . Trailer , go see Artie , go . Josh , I 'm really , really , really sorry . Hey , you remember that one time when you were stuck in a different dimension ? This is way better than that , am I right ? I 'm gonna take that as a yes . All right : Possibilities . Uh , paleontologist Georges Cuvier discovered that species could go extinct . Uh , he carried a handkerchief with a gold embroidered dragonfly . Wait , wait , wait . What 's this ? Uh--oh . No , this is a napkin with mustard on it next to food that humans should not eat . Or Pliny The Elder wrote a treatise theorizing that amber went from liquid to a solid , - so it could be a- - - A tiny scroll . - Yes ! - I found it . Okay , good . Neutralize it . Not that easy . It 's inside the amber . This tea is going to make you feel so ... Oh , my God . What--what are you doing ? Um , I- - you know , Trace , this is an anti-fungal spray . It was created by the Secret Service . It detects and exposes mold . Seriously ? Yes . Yes , and--and that sweater set is just covered in mold . So who 's the best aunt ever ? I am . Me . You are . Sorry I freaked out . I--hormones . Oh , here . Have your tea . Okay . It ... smells tangy . That 's the catnip . Drink it fast ! It 's yummy . Trace , um , you know what ? I have to go take a call , but I 'll be right back , okay ? - Oh , well , take your tea . - Well , I- - - Oh ! - Oh ! Oh , my God . Trace , your new carpet . I 'm so sorry . It--it 's okay . I 'll get it . Just--just take your call . Go . Okay . Mykes , hey . Are--are you okay ? There is something definitely wrong with Tracy . Her eyes are doing this weird thing , and--and then she gave me this--this tea and- - Oh , my God , I think my sister tried to poison me . Wow , you said your family was competitive , but jeez . No ! It 's obviously an artifact . I just--I have no idea what I 'm looking for . Same here . I mean , Amanda was whammied by something in a leather box , but I can 't find anything . - Is she okay ? - Well , she 's super hot . Yes , Pete , I 've met her , but if you could just set that aside for a moment- - What ? No . Wait , no , no , no . She--she has a fever . The--the doctors have her on antibiotics , and it 's not helping . I don 't know , Pete . Have you tried- - Uh , Pete , Amanda will be fine . You will figure this out . I-I have to go , okay ? How is she , doc ? Okay , I 'm gonna prep an ice bath . She 's 106 and rising . Thank God the bear 's Italian . What ? Amanda , are you hallucinating ? No . We were camping , remember ? We heard a bear outside our tent that ate our dinner . Oh , yeah , yeah . Yeah , he , uh--he ate that whole pot of spaghetti . And then I said , " Thank God that bear 's Italian . " What made you think of that ? I was just thinking how , even though you were joking , you were really scared of that bear . Yes , I was . But I wasn 't . No . You 're not afraid of anything . Pete , I 'm scared now . I know . Come here . Oh , my--oh , my God , Amanda , your back . What ? Wha--what is it ? Your tattoo . It--it--it 's glowing . It 's on fire , like it 's infected . Okay , now you 're hallucinating . - I don 't have a tattoo . - Yes , you do . It 's right- - It was just right there . It was a cat . Pete , I-I-I feel better . Like--like a lot better ! Whatever you did with your hand , it worked . I didn 't do any ... thing . Whoa ! Ooh ! Oh ! Ooh , no ! Oh . Oh , G--oh , my God . Where is it ? Where is it ? Oh , it stopped , it stopped . It 's on your shoulder . It 's getting really hot in here , right ? That static charge that you felt when you hugged Tracy ? That could have marked the activation of an artifact . But she 's been in contact with lots of other people . It could be sibling-specific . Okay , so what exactly am I looking for ? There are dozens of sibling rivalry artifacts : Cain and Abel , Romulus and Remus , Venus and Serena . I 'll--I 'll check . I don 't suppose Cain or Abel had a white sweater set , did they ? What ? - Come on . - Artie ? Error signals . He 's jammed the database again . Artie , are you there ? Good-bye , Artie . Uh ... Ooh . What , I didn 't say good-bye ? Uh , well , " Hello " would make more sense . Pete . Yeah , sorry . Uh , I 'm--I 'm just- - you look awful . Thank you , Artie . I , uh--I picked up a stray cat tattoo . Uh , does that look familiar ? It says " Kotik , " which is Russian for " Kitten . " Kotik 's also the party name of Ignaty Gryniewietsky . He was a member of the people 's will in pre-bolshevik Russia . And--and do they call him Kitten 'cause he 's cute and cuddly ? He was a terrorist who assassinated Tsar Alexander II . Right , so the nickname is ironic , like when Myka calls me " Einstein . " All right , what did Kotik do ? Well , he and other members , they filled kerosene cans with nitroglycerine . They approached the tsar . First man detonated . When the tsar went to inspect the body , Kotik just finished the job . A suicide bomber . Yeah , many regard him as history 's first . Okay , great . So , eventually , I go boom . How--how do we stop it , Artie ? - We tried goo-ing it- - - No ! Look , uh , just , uh- - you get it off your body . - Cut it off , if you have to . - What , what , what ? I-I gotta go . Really ? Wh- - Trailer , come on . He 's getting away . Okay , Pete , hold on . Let me just get a corpsman in here . - Maybe they can- - - No , no , no , no , no . Amanda , no doctor is gonna cut off a tattoo , okay ? I need you to do this . Me ? Pete , I don 't think I can . - Aha ! Okay . - No , Pete , I- - - Amanda . - Mm . I know there 've been plenty of times that you 've wanted to stick a knife in me . This is your chance . Uh , we should numb it first . No time . Aah ! - I can take it . - Oh , God , okay . Okay . - Ah ! - What , what ? - It moved ! - All right , well , keep trying ! - It- - - What , what , what ? It won 't let me get near it . What the hell is that ? Uh , that is a radiation detector . It 's all my fault , 'cause I was thinking it couldn 't get any worse . Okay . Uh , I realize this may be a brute force solution to a delicate problem , but I don 't see a lot of other choices here , Josh , so I 'm banking on two things . One , that the internet 's right about amber , and , two , that you won 't feel this . There seems to be no clue as to what happened to the brotherhood organization . Father Domenico says no one has seen a single member either come in or go out in months . Vatican knows nothing . At the risk of invoking an Abbott and Costello movie , it could be that there 's some sort of- - - Secret panel . - Yes . Agent Jinks ? Did you find the hidden panel ? Tracy ? Trace . Myka . Look , you 've been affected by something . Myka , you 're sounding crazy . I just need you to trust me . Of course . Oh , my God . What ? What 's wrong ? I just felt the baby move for the first time . - Oh , my God . - Oh ! Oh , my God , you have to feel this ! Okay . Here ? - Yes . - Okay . Always so damn perfect . Not such a smartie now , huh ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you , but ... - Aah ! I am a trained Secret Service agent . - Yeah ? - Mm-hmm . Well , I completed the insanity workout ! That was handmade ! Ow , ow , my hair ! You and your hair . " I like it curly ! I like it straight ! " Make a decision . Look , you could never take me in a fight , okay , not when you were nine , not now . I don 't know why this is happening so fast . - Okay . - It 's getting worse . I feel like the inside of a microwave popcorn bag . I just hope this thing can hold the blast . It offers explosive mitigation and radiation shielding for 2,000 pounds of TNT equivalent . - Well , I 'm 180 . - Pete . All right , well , a few more on my fat days . Listen , this cell phone 's not gonna work inside . You 're gonna be all alone in there , Pete . I know . Look , Amanda , if--if there was any way ... that I could do this without being the biggest hero you ever met ... Far bigger than your husband Michael , I 'd do it . Pete . Tell them to name something after me . Not a mall . There 's that smile . I 'm glad it 's the last thing I 'll see . Pete . I never stopped loving you . You were always jealous I had more friends than you ! Jimmy Quinn only asked you to the prom as a favor to me . Otherwise , your date would 've just been Joel . - Who 's Joel ? - Joel the mole . That 's what we called that thing on your face ! That was- - that was a beauty mark ! Beauty marks don 't have hair . Myka , I need to talk to you . Pete , my sister is so mean . She had a nickname for my mole . And I just told you I had a mole . It 's okay . I don 't care . Pete , what 's wrong ? Is Amanda okay ? Yes . She 's fine . Pete , you 're- - you 're glowing . That 's kinda what I called you about . Uh , Myka , I think this might be the- - I don 't see a way out this time , okay , and I ... I think this might be the end . Okay , Pete , just tell me everything . Okay , okay . I have a tattoo of a cat from a Russian suicide bomber on my back that 's about to explode , okay ? It transfers from skin to skin . - Did you try- - - You can 't burn it off , cut it off , or goo it off . Okay , how--how did the tattoo transfer to Amanda in the first place ? I don 't know . It 's--it 's unclear . It came with this box . I-I tried to neutralize it , but it- - Oh , my God . Pete , Pete , what if the tattoo didn 't come in the box ? What if it came on the box ? Think about it . After all , what 's leather ? I don 't know . Skin . Wait , Myka . Leather--leather is skin ! Right , maybe even the skin from the suicide bomber . Eww ! Sometimes this job can be so gross ! Okay , so if it transferred to Amanda from the box , if it transfers skin to skin ... Uh , maybe I can transfer it back . Yes , just press the box against the tattoo . Okay , okay , okay . Damn it ! What ? Pete , what 's wrong ? I do too many pull-ups . I should 've done yoga . Myka , please don 't let my last words be " I should 've done yoga . " No , no , just listen to me ! You are not just gonna lie down and die , okay ? Lie down ! Myka , lie down ! Lie down ! - Aah ! - Pete , you 're raving . Pete ? Oh , my God , did you explode ? Pete , did you--did you melt ? Pete ? I 'm okay . Give me some skin ! Yes ! Oh , my God , I saw the explosion and I thought- - No , no , I 'm good . I 'm good . I 'm okay . - Oh , thank God ! - Oh , oh , oh , I know . Oh , I know . I know . I know , I know , I know . I know . - Pete . - Amanda . Pete . You can let go now , Pete . Huh ? - At ease ! - Right . Oh , uh , I 'm sorry . Ngs . Do you have a Black Hawk I could borrow ? I can 't just give a helicopter to a civilian . Oh , really ? Not even a civilian you 're still in love with ? - I never said that . - Yes , you did . - No , I said ... - No , no , no . - " I never stopped loving you . " - You can 't take it back now . Totally different thing . - You can 't just go back . - It doesn 't mean anything . What do you mean it doesn 't mean anything ? It means something to me . All right , fine , I 'll get you a helicopter , all right ? That looks hot enough . Yay , internet ! Oh , jeez . Josh , get a manicure . And hello , scroll . - Huh ! - Do not recoil , earthling . I come in peace . Claudia ? Surprise ... visit ... to show you my Halloween idea this year . No , no , no , no . You 're here because--ow ! Something Warehouse-y happened , didn 't it ? No . Yes , but I saved you , again . What just happened ? I-I-I was looking at this painting , and then- - This frame was constructed by Rembrandt 's master framer who used wood from the acacia tree of Iusaaset . - The tree of life . - Very good . That 's how some of Rembrandt 's paintings are so incredibly lifelike . So is the brotherhood in there too ? Brother Adrian must have trapped them inside before he left for the Warehouse . They should be following you out one by one . There 's one now . Who are you people ? You cannot be in the library ! Keep that handy , Agent Jinks . I have a feeling you 'll use it several more times . Just wait till Kevin comes home . Oh , that 's right . I have a husband and you don 't . Nothing here , nothing . Nothing is reacting . Trace , you okay ? I don 't feel so good . Trace ? Tracy ? Myka ! Pete , I 'm up here ! Pete . Your work husband ? Only husband you 'll ever have . Mykes ! Hey , are you hurt ? Well , not physically , but--but next Thanksgiving might be a little problematic . How 's Tracy ? She 's not good . Her heartbeat 's going crazy . I 'm a little worried about the baby . And the artifact ? I can 't find anything . Well , looks like you went through everything but the wrapping paper . What ? Wrapping paper . The garbage ! I haven 't checked the wrapping paper in the garbage ! Hurry , Mykes ! So tell me about the mole . What is it , Trailer ? Dogs usually like me . Why don 't you- - why don 't you just kill me ? I 'm not a murderer . But don 't worry . You 're never getting out of here again . So who is Brother Adrian ? Just another in the long list of psychos who love artifacts , I guess . But how would he know I was in Menlo Park ? I mean , that was a secret unless you told someone . Mm-mmm , not me , unless you inadvertently- - Uh-uh , Artie was clear . If I told anyone , he would personally- - Wait . Artie knew you were here ? Well , yeah , he set it all up about two weeks ago . But that--he acted like it was a complete surprise , like he never even knew . That 's weird . You know , he was kind of abrupt about the whole thing . I mean , more than usual . At first , it didn 't even sound like him . Okay . I think I got it all . All right . So , um , look for something that 's--that 's old-timey or--or out of place . Yep . Hey , Mykes . What is this ? Uh , that--that is a , uh , ribbon hat . It 's a dumbass tradition in--in baby showers . Yeah , well , nothing says artifact like dumbass tradition . And may I also say ... Hey-hey-hey , huh ? Definitely old-timey . Also weird and out of place . Here . - Myka . - It 's not helping . Okay , so it 's a cord , right ? So what else do you do with a cord ? I don 't know . You unravel a cord . You--you--you rip a cord . You--you ... Cut the cord ! - Let 's cut it . - Okay . Um , all right . - Ready ? - Yeah . Tracy , are you okay ? Myka ? You--you were in the driveway . But how did you- - Uh , you were- - you passed out , you know ? Pregnancy causes low blood pressure , and I read somewhere that , um , forced limb extensions can help with , uh ... Your pulse . - It 's back to normal . - I had the weirdest dream . Maybe we should call your doctor . No . No , I-I feel fine , really . Okay . It 's just so great to see you . Oh , me too . Hey , your hair looks really cute like that . Do you think so ? 'Cause I really like it curly , but maybe I should go back to the- - You know what , Tracy ? It doesn 't matter . - Hey , Claud . - Pete , can you talk ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm here with Myka . Tracy 's okay , but I 'm getting a really weird vibe . I think I know why . Myka , what happened here ? Uh , well , there was a , uh ... windstorm . But I closed the window just in time . Who 's the best aunt ever ? Me . I am . - You are . - Hey , Mykes ! Just , um- - I 'll be right back , okay ? A windstorm ? In Colorado Springs ? Hey , Claud , is Joshua okay ? Yeah , he 's fine . Um , it 's Artie . Pete , he lied to me . He flat-out lied about not knowing Joshua was in Menlo Park . And have you noticed anything weird about him today ? Yeah , yeah . I was having a lot of trouble with an artifact , and he just hung up the Farnsworth . He totally left me hanging . He never does that . Well , he 's distracted . Brother Adrian is in the Warehouse , and--and Artie said that the database is down . Yeah , except that it 's not . I set up a remote testing system . It checks in every few minutes . I would 've gotten the alert . - Why would Artie say that ? - I don 't know . We need to get back to the Warehouse right now . This is how we deal with the worst of the worst . You 'll fit right in . Don 't do this , Arthur . You need me . Like I need cancer . You are finished attacking me and the people I care about . You 're making a terrible decision . No , I 'm making sure you never hurt us again . Trailer , where 's Artie ? Where 's Artie , Trailer ? Brother Dimitri ! No need to attack . - They 're from the Warehouse . - What has happened ? You have all been trapped in that painting for several months . A global crisis forced one of our agents to use Magellan 's astrolabe . I imagine you know what that means . An evil was created . And that 's where you guys come in . One of yours has gone rogue and has been trying to kill us . It 's over . It 's finally over . It 'll never be over . What ? H-how ? No , no , it can 't- - can 't be- - Who is it you accuse of turning against the brotherhood ? Brother Adrian . - You are lying . - He tried to kill me . When ? Where ? Two weeks ago in South Dakota . It is not possible . I understand it may be difficult to believe something like this is possible- - Mrs. Frederic . You 're a fool . Oh , God . That 's enough . That 's enough ! Just leave me alone ! Leave my family alone ! Just get out my life ! Not until you use the astrolabe . Never ! I 'll never do what you want . And I 'll stop you . I 'll stop you , I will . Artie ! What are you doing ? - Leena . - No ! Don 't you touch her ! You leave her alone ! Leena , run . Get out ! Something has happened . Brother Adrian , have you ever been in South Dakota ? No , I have not . He 's telling the truth . Then who is at the Warehouse ? I swear by everything that I hold dear , if you touch one hair on her head , then I 'll- - What ? You 'll do what ? Artie , stop ! Please stop . Artie , there 's nobody there ! It 's just you . It 's just you . What ? Just me ? No . Just me ? Just me ? No . What ? No , no , no , no . See , he used an artifact . He used an artifact to disappear the instant that you showed up . No . No , I 've been watching you for a while , Artie , and you 've been shouting at the air . - Stop ! - No ! No . He tried to kill Vanessa and tried to kill Steve and Claudia , and he did all of that just so that I would use the astrolabe . Artie , it 's going to be okay , okay ? We 're gonna figure this out . We 're gonna figure this out . No , no , no , no . Oh . Leena , where are you ? I 'm in the Bronze Sector with Artie . Mrs. Frederic , I 'm worried . He 's--he 's talking to Brother Adrian , but- - But he 's not there , is he ? I am with Brother Adrian now at the Vatican . Whatever the effects of the astrolabe , I 'm afraid it 's caused Arthur to have some sort of psychotic break . It would seem that the Brother Adrian that Arthur has been battling never really existed . It 's all in his mind ? A construct of his subconscious . I think he 's figuring that out now . And he--he came to me . He sat right there ! The astrolabe was our only solution . You have to believe me . I tried to tell you . And he said there would be an evil that I would not be able to control . I need your help , Arthur , in the Warehouse . How do you know about the Warehouse ? He sent a mirror to Rapid City . He sent a mirror to Rapid City . Hugo ! He--he tried to kill Hugo . He tried to bury Claudia and Steve . They were dead , and I had to use it ! No ! What is it , Trailer ? I ... I shot him . I shot him . I 'm not a murderer . You 're never getting out of here again . Yes , I ... And I had him . I touched him ! He pretended to be me . No , no , no . It 's a trick . Leena , I want you to leave the Warehouse . Go . Go now . Let me help you . Artie , what 's going on ? The Dark Vault . It 's in the Dark Vault . Artie , stop . Look at me . Oh , my God . You 're--who are you ? Who are you ? You 're in my way . Pete , what is it ? A vibe , I just got hit with a big one . Not since my dad . - Call the Warehouse . - What ? Mykes , call the Warehouse ! Okay .

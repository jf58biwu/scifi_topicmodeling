 Why did Peter attack this man ? And why is the pathogen - making him stronger ? - Pending necropsy , I believe we may have found the source of the contagion . This mutation only occurs in a fraction of the samples . It 's minimal , but it 's statistically relevant . - But what 's it doing to him ? - Open the door . - No . - Come on ! Now ! People have to know what 's going on up here ! Peter . It 's all right . Alan ? It 's all right . Relax . What happened ? You tell me . I found you here passed out . - What do you remember ? - Uh , I was , uh ... I ... I was , uh ... taking a shower - decontamination procedures - and ... and ... Uh ... um ... I , uh ... - I ... - Jules . I just felt lightheaded . I don 't remem ... I don 't remember what happened next . I guess I , um ... I didn 't realize how exhausted I am . Well , we 've ... all been pushing really hard . You need to get a few hours ' sleep . - Yeah . - I need you 100 % for this one . - OK , good idea . - I 'll walk you back to your quarters . With Peter roaming around out there , it 's not safe to go alone . I 'll give you a moment . Hello ? Anybody in here ? Help ... me . Please report to me immediately if you see any skin lesions , flu-like symptoms , or black mucus discharge . Should we not be taking antivirals ? Like ... - oseltamivir ? - That 's for H1N1 influenza . We 've ruled that out as a cause of infection . - What is it then ? - It 's all right . Taking the wrong meds can do more harm than no meds at all . We 're working ' round the clock on a treatment , and when we find it , we 'll attack the virus aggressively . Now , they are scared ; I get that . But sometimes I just want to yell at ' em , you know ? We 're not the enemy here . Security teams are doing constant sweeps . Still no sign of our three escapees or Peter Farragut . And another attack has been reported on Level G - two more possibly infected . They 're being moved to isolation . We 've been in lockdown for 32 hours . People are panicking . If something doesn 't change , we risk losing control of the base . Where is Julia Walker ? I ... I 'm not sure . Do you want to speak to her ? That won 't be necessary . Dr. Farragut . - What are you doing ? - Getting my brother - into containment . - Why didn 't you inform us ? Because I presumed the man you had following me would tip you off . I want a full workup - LFT , CBC with differential , coags , viral screen , and all available - antigen-antibody assays . - My security teams couldn 't wrangle him . How did you manage it ? He turned himself in . What is Peter 's status ? Stable for now . I meant the status of his sedation . We don 't want - another security incident . - That 's unlikely . As unlikely as cutting off a man 's hand to access his RFID chip ? Peter gave himself up ; no fight , no struggle . Why would he do that - if he were planning to escape ? - That 's what we thought - the last time we put him in isolation . - He appears to be controllable on morphine . I 've hooked him up to a pain pump . He shouldn 't - be a danger to anyone . - I 'm not willing - to take that chance . - Neither am I. Is there somewhere more secure we can hold him ? This floor was phase one of Arctic Biosystems . As the company grew , so did the facility . Level R contains our early labs and living quarters , along with maintenance for the entire base . The ventilation system in this room is separate from the rest of the facility . The walls are concrete , three feet thick , and the door is double-plated steel . - Nothing is getting in or out . - What kind of research were you conducting with nuclear reactors ? I spent time at Sandia Labs . The burn patterns on these walls are virtually identical . Controlled fusion , a project we abandoned . When was the last radiation screen down here ? We test every six months , and the lab has been empty - for about five years . - So it 's safe ? Perfectly . More than qualified to be an isolation unit for Peter . For everyone else as well . There are empty rooms on this level , plenty of space , and this secure lab allows us - to separate vectors from those who are just infected . - Vectors ? It 's what we 're calling the infected who are ... physically attacking others to spread the disease , like Peter . I think we can achieve full containment down here . Well , what are you saying ? I 'm saying we turn Level R into an isolation floor . Get it together , Jules . You don 't ... get ... sick . All right , we have 18 sick in isolation , including Peter . - With three on the loose and two presumed infected , that 's 23 . - That we know of . I want to move them all down to Level R. I 'll need medical equipment . Turn one of the labs into a triage unit . I 'll need food , water , bedding , for 40 patients . This thing will get bigger before we achieve full containment . I think we can accommodate that . Help me . Help me . - Stay where you are . - I 'm sorry I ran . They made me do it . - We can help . - They made me ! - You need to stop . - Believe me . They made me ... Bring the guaranine and find Dr. Duchamp . No ! There 's no time . She 's going into shock . Find me a scalpel and something to pack into the wound . Stay with me now . You 'll be OK . Hurry up ! All right , I feel the bullet . Here , pinch off this vein . Pinch off this vein ! Yes . More pressure . Right there . I have it , I have it . Good . You 're gonna be fine now . She should be stable enough to move . We take her down to the fusion lab . - Thanks to your quick thinking . - My quick thinking shouldn 't have been necessary in the first place . All right . Come on . Come on ! She was unarmed and asking for our help . I was only trying to protect Dr. Hatake . She wasn 't threatening him ; she was scared . - The situation was escalating . - It didn 't escalate until you panicked and almost murdered an infected patient ! I set the rules on this base . There are no countries here , no laws . Dr. Sulemani 's life is my responsibility , not Daniel 's . As senior scientist on this case , every patient 's life is my responsibility . You tell your security people that this is the last time lethal force is to be used on one of my patients ! - I can 't guarantee that . - You tell them ! Or I 'll pull my team , and we can do this again in six months time as a postmortem ! What did you do to me , Peter ? What did you do ? We seal off the stairwells , use the elevator for an airlock , and once we control access to the floor , we should have a viable isolation unit . So , healthy people come upstairs ; sick people go down . - It might work . - But if people aren 't showing symptoms yet , how do we know who 's infected ? We 'll need a test , something that we can administer quickly . A rapid-response test would be the fastest . But first we need to synthesize a pure sample of the virus . - Both viruses . What about those vials you found in Peter 's lab ? - Neither NARVIK-A nor B show up as a pathogen in any existing database . NARVIK-B is the strain that created the vectors in the rat population , right ? How long to synthesize a test - based on that variant ? - Eight hours at least for something functional . Well , you have four . Work with Jordan . Tell me more about this infected monkey . I think the virus inside the monkey is the key . I 'm sequencing the full genome now . If we can prove that the infection passed from monkey to human ... It gets us one step closer to the original strain . - And the best shot we have at a vaccine . - All right , get started on it . I 'll go with her ; can 't be too careful right now . - Thanks , but I can take care of myself . - Doreen , take him with you . All right , everybody , the com link window goes live in six hours and 42 minutes . If we have this data to upload to Atlanta , we might just get on top of this thing . Let 's get to work . And 20 bags - make that 30 bags - of saline drip . Our base doctor 's seen Dr. Sulemani . She 's gonna make it . Well , have him keep her on a propofol infusion . I didn 't panic with Sulemani . She was infected with a lethal virus and coming at Dr. Hatake . I assessed the options and I pulled the trigger . We shoot everyone who 's infected ? Is that it ? - Eliminate the threat ? - If necessary . And those who might be infected ? Do we kill them too ? The only reason you didn 't fire that shot is because the gun wasn 't in your hands . - Another false positive . - Me too . I 've gone through - all of the atypical enzymes . - You started with atypicals ? Their catalyzation rate is too low . I read a study that linked the use of atypical enzymes to certain viral antibodies . You have to start wide and narrow down . That 's why I assigned you EC-1 enzymes ... EC-1 catalyzes with everything , which tells us nothing , and we don 't have time to go through a thousand different enzymes . If we 're gonna come up with a test in last at 3 hours , we need to do some crea ... - Sarah . - What ? What 's wrong with your hand ? Are you OK ? Are you feeling any symptoms ? I 've been up for three days straight . I 'm probably just exhausted . We 're out of Peter 's blood serum . I should go - get some more samples ... - I 'll do it . If you find the virus did come from the monkeys , will that help you figure out a cure ? " Curing " a virus is a relative term . We need a treatment to help the infected folks get better , and a vaccine to prevent anyone else from getting infected . That sick monkey is just the first step down a long road ... Where the hell is my monkey ? What 's that smell ? Formaldehyde . Whoever did this wanted to kill any living organism left behind . They didn 't want me analyzing the samples - from that monkey . - It reeks . Reeks all right . Reeks of Hatake . What are you gonna do ? Walk into his office - and demand answers ? - Why not ? Because you know how that conversation 's gonna go . He 's gonna say it was biosafety protocol , or scheduled maintenance . I knew this full-bird colonel , just like Hatake . Real stickler . You had to find creative ways to get things done . What 'd you have in mind ? What if I could get you another monkey sample ? What are you doing here ? Three days ago , we were moving on with our lives , and now this ? Seeing you , it all comes flooding back - how unhappy I was with Alan ; how I couldn 't even recognize ... who I was with him anymore . But instead of acknowledging it , I didn 't say anything ; I just ... swallowed it , all of it , until it filled me up , and I was drowning in it . And then you . I thought I could handle this . Never seen anything like this . Look at their faces ! I know . It 's pretty damn scary . No , not scary ; scared . These monkeys were running for their lives . Running from what ? How 'd you find this place , anyway ? I was just checking the stability of the icepack around the base . Horseshit . Who the hell are you ? I 'm just an army engineer , like I said . You want to work together ? I got no problem with that . But you have got to start telling me the truth . - I am ! - Ha . There are people in the army , myself included , who are wondering if this outbreak was an accident . You think Hatake did this on purpose ? Why would he do that ? Why don 't you come help me find out ? I want 24-hour guards on this door until we get full containment . Base One , go ahead . They found one of the escapees on this level . What are you so happy about ? Nothing . I just cracked the test . You figured it out ? Which enzyme catalyzed ? None of them . After you left , I remembered another study . It utilizes the body 's natural way - of detecting foreign pathogens . - White blood cells , yes . Get to the point . So it modified the white blood cells with genes from a crystal jellyfish , Aequorea victoria , to create a rapid-response test . The jellyfish genes produce a fluorescent green protein . - You replicated this ? - I swabbed three security techs for control samples - all clear . Then I ran the test on known infectees - Peter , Dr. Tracey , and Dr. DeKlerk . All green - positive for infection . Show me again . Use yourself as a control . Why does that matter ? Look , if you want to see it in action , I can take a swab from you right now . OK . Test me . I don 't know why we 're wasting our time with this . We need to tell Alan . Come on , Duchamp ! I know you 're in there ! - Don 't come any closer . - Put it down . Put it down . - We 're going to help you . - Oh , just like you took care - of Dr. Sulemani , huh ? - What happened to Dr. Sulema- - - You want us all to die ! - ... was a terrible mistake , all right ? We don 't want to hurt you , but you have - to come to isolation . - I 'm not going there ! I 'm not even infected ! Or at least I wasn 't until you threw me in with the rest of them ! - Let me help you . - I want the cure ! - We don 't have a cure . - Bullshit ! The SODRA 's in there . You 're keeping it from us , and I 'm not gonna let you ! Put him in the fusion lab with Sulemani . This is Alan Farragut of the CDC . Everybody all right in there ? Thank God you 're here . They almost got in . - What 's your name ? - Philippe Duchamp . What was he saying about you having a cure ? This is ridiculous . There is no cure . Adding growth factor so the cells will build a critical mass for the genome sequencing . And we stick it in the incubator and wait . - So , do the thing I 've been doing for the last hour . - Hm . Is that supposed to happen ? So , then you said you 're growning the virus ? - It wasn 't supposed to grow like that . - You mean like it was alive ? Viruses aren 't living organisms . They lack any form of energy or carbon metabolism . - Why did it Hulk out ? - That 's what we 're gonna find out . Maybe Alan 'll know why it reacted so violently - to the growth factor . - Wait . - Don 't . - Don 't what ? Don 't tell anyone . If Hatake gets wind of this , it 'll be the monkey room all over again . I still don 't trust you , but when you 're right , you 're right . Dr. Bryce said Duchamp was working on a ... a cure , - something called SODRA . - I can 't discuss that . The research is proprietary . No ! No more secrets ! You promised me transparency . When the satellite comes online , I 'll speak with my board of directors . You will tell me everything I need to know , or when that satellite comes online , I 'll tell every major news organization on Earth what 's happening in this base . You think you 're afraid of the US military ? Wait till you have to keep your secrets New York Post . SODRA is an antiviral treatment with an astonishing cure rate - nearly 100 % . When you say cure , you mean total viral elimination ? - With no harm to host cells ? - Yes . How many viruses have you tested against ? How wide a range ? All of them . H1N1 ? Hepatitis ? HIV ? Hell , smallpox is a virus . There are only two places on Earth that have smallpox : the CDC , and Vector Institute in Russia . Actually , there are three . You have been growing lethal viruses for the purpose of developing a cure-all . SODRA works . In all animal test cases , the viruses were killed . The only problem is the mortality rate . How many subjects were killed ? Over 75 % . Which is why SODRA is not an option . Level R has been sealed . We 'll take everyone downstairs , go person to person . Anyone who 's infected stays below ; everyone else comes back up . A hundred and forty tests ready to go . You two did good work . If I call your name , please step over here , take a face shield from Dr. Jordan , and then come stand over here . Doctors ... Alvarez ... Mihalovich ... Hassan . Security Tech Terry . Dr. Sun-Lee . Security Tech Gruning . Those of you whose names I have called , you 'll follow me . The rest of you will stay with Dr. Jordan and Dr. Walker . Wait ! Why are they getting to go back upstairs ? Because they tested negative for the virus . Please find any empty cot . Make yourselves at home . Dr. Walker and Dr. Jordan will be coming around to collect your medical information . Go ahead . - That 's the last group . - How many ? - Forty-three infected . - That 's almost a third of the base . I want to bring Drs. Bryce and Sulemani down here . Shouldn 't they stay locked up in the fusion lab ? They already tried to escape once . This floor is secure . There 's no way out . Excuse me . Isolating this level was a good idea . People are settling in . Yeah , but they 're scared . I think a lot of them believed they weren 't sick . Part of them knew . They just didn 't want to believe it . I took Peter 's vitals again . He 's all over the place ... I 'm sending his lab work to the CDC as soon as the satellite window opens . Get some more heads in the game when finding a safe treatment and a vaccine . That may be too late for him . Open the door . Let 's get these people into the isolation beds . Almost done with the samples ? I was just about to bring them upstairs . - What 's wrong ? - No , I 'm fine . I just slipped . - Are you infected , Sarah ? - What ? You were in the drug stockroom with Peter . Did he attack you ? - No . I told you . He ran off . - That 's right , you told us . You think I would lie about something like that ? Your symptoms . You tried to hide your hand tremor this morning , and you wouldn 't use yourself as a control sample for the rapid-response test ... You want me to take the test ? - Fine . - I 'm not judging . I can understand ... I would never risk spreading an infectious disease . That 's completely unethical . What kind of a doctor do you think I am ? It 's clear . Happy ? - I 'm sorry . I just thought ... - Where 's Alan ? Checking the triage room . Why ? We have a problem . Dr. Sulemani broke out of the fusion lab . - She killed Dr. Bryce . - What ? Dr. Sulemani is on this level ? She 's killing people ! Stop ! Remain calm ! Stop ! Please , stay calm ! Calm down ! Calm down ! - Relax , get back ! - Back ! Everyone remain calm ! - Sarah ! - Alan ! What 's going on ? Where 's Julia ? Get back ! Julia ! Get back ! Back , now ! Out of the hallway ! Get out of the hallway ! Get out of the hallway ! - We need to get in the elevator . Get upstairs ... - I can 't . We 'll regroup , get medical supplies for the injured ... - I have to stay down here . - It 's too dangerous . - We have to go . - Alan , I can 't . What happened ? Where is Dr. Walker ? She 's staying down there . How could you risk leaving her ? Dr. Farragut . Alan ! She 's infected . She has the virus . We need to seal off Level R. It 's the only way to stop the contagion . Leave them down there ? With no food or water ? There 's a week 's worth of supplies . He 's right . We 've ... I have lost control of this situation . We need to seal it off . How can you say that with Dr. Walker still down there ? It 's only until help arrives . When the satellite com link goes operative again , I 'm calling in the army for backup . Two hundred and seventy-four . Three nurses in Kikwit of Ebola ; family of six in Sudan , Lassa fever ; 10 students in a Heidelberg dorm , Legionnaires ' disease ; We 've all had people die on our watch , Alan . It 's part of the job . We save who we can . I could live with 274 because it was the disease that killed them , not me , until now . I not only killed someone with my own hands today ... but it 's very likely ... Julia - is very likely ... - Way I hear it , you didn 't have much choice . What we 're dealing with here ... none of us has ever seen . You 're still the best CDC has . I 've seen you pull off miracles . You 'll figure out a way to save ' em both . What happened with the monkey ? It 's inconclusive for now . That 's too bad . I 'm , uh ... I 'm still doing tests . No . No . No , they should be green , they should all be green ! It doesn 't work . It doesn 't work ! - Observation . - Doreen , where 's Alan ? Jules ? Hello ? Alan ? Jules ? You there ? Jules ? Hello ? ! Can anybody hear me ? ! The test doesn 't work ! It doesn 't work !

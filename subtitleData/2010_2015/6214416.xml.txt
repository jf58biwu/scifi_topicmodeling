 JED : Hey , Potter . I scored us a buck . Half of it 's for you . POTTER : Don 't come any closer , Jed . Jenny 's got it , the Red Flu . She stumbled over a body by Canyon Creek . She didn 't see the X. I 'm not gonna let you starve . I 'm leaving you the buck . Grandpa . What 'd you get ? Game was a little scarce today , kiddo . Plainview is a full day 's hike but a total score . Fully stocked and completely deserted . Oh , I love these . DARIEN : Let 's put everything away in the pantry . Perishables in front , canned goods in back . And those are for breakfast . You shouldn 't be going so far out by yourself . I think I saw an electronics store there . I could go back tomorrow and get you that part you need . What is it , a vacuum tube ? - You 're not going . - It 's our only chance of getting a hold of Tom . He 's your son . If anyone can survive , it 's him . It 's a capacitor , not a vacuum tube . And bring a weapon . Yes , sir . JETER : The ceremony will be at 0900 . We 'll have seven gunners and the ensigns at half-mast . It 'll be a hero 's farewell . He wanted to redeem himself . He never had to . He gave his life for mine . He gave his life for the mission . And now we 're free ... to finish it . Congratulations , little guy . Your job here is done . SCOTT : I can actually do with some help with these boxes . You can stack them up over there . - Thank you . - At your service . A little more room between those cots , please . So , uh , the peeps are asking ... what 's this whole human guinea-pig thing gonna look like ? I mean , basically , you infect the crew with the virus , you see what happens ? Well , not the entire crew . Six individuals of varying blood and genetic markers . First , we administer the vaccine prototype ... then we inject each of them with the virus . TEX : I gotta tell you ... I don 't know if people are gonna be lining up for that . Well , that 's not my department . MASON : This is the last one we recorded . DOMINIC [ ON RECORDING ] : Hello ? Is anyone listening ? My name is Dominic . We 're stranded on a boat , west of the island of Jamaica . There are 50 of us . Many are sick . We need help . - Anyone ? - Turn it off . DOMINIC : Please . I thought I wanted to hear his voice again ... but not like that . It must have been so hard listening to all of that suffering . Are you sure that you wanna be there ? To watch the trials ? It 'll be part of my blood flowing through those people . I have to see if it 's going to work . SAILOR : Ready . Aim . Fire . [ GUNSHOTS ] Ready . Aim . Fire . Fire . CHANDLER : How are we gonna ask them to do this ? We don 't have time or resources to recruit from anywhere else . I know , but six people ? She doesn 't have the equipment to sustain a quarantine for more than a few days ... which is just enough time for one trial with as many people as she can fit into that lab . Well , then I have to volunteer . We just risked everything to save your sorry ass so that you could lead . What kind of message does that send ? You got rank , you can sit it out ? - Everyone else can be the guinea pigs ? - Captain 's right . Someone from a leadership position needs to volunteer to set an example . Which is why I already had Dr. Scott do a work-up on me . Apparently I check off a few of the boxes she needs : African-American , male over 40 , Southern Baptist . - Master chief ... - With all due respect , it 's already been done . And you don 't even know if you 'd qualify . The crew needs you , in some ways , more than either one of us . I appreciate the sentiment , sir , but you both know we 're all needed . And we 're all dispensable . All right , spread the word we need volunteers . Let the crew know it 'll be completely confidential . I don 't want anyone feeling pressured . Aye , sir . Told you God put me here for a reason . Maybe this is it . RIOS : Let 's just line them up over here . Thanks . KELLY : Hello , captain . - You seem to be settling in well . Well , I thought I 'd make myself useful . CHANDLER : How 's Ava ? She 's doing okay . Thank you . RIOS : I need two chairs around each of these tables , and the medical questionnaires . I ... I haven 't had the opportunity to thank you for what you did for my family ... after what I did to you . Commander Slattery said you were very helpful while I was on vacation . Still ... I don 't deserve what you did . Let 's finish what we started . - Any history of serious injuries ? - No , sir . Never even broken a bone . Any flu-like symptoms ? Aches or pains ? Just aching to do my part . [ CHATTERING ] I never expected this many . Do you really think you 'd qualify to volunteer ... when you barely survived dengue fever last week ? You 're not even gonna test my blood ? Danny . TEX : Hey . I 'm looking for the Copacabana . Anyone point me in the right direction ? " Harvest Queen 2008 " ? You never told me you were royalty . Dr. Scott says we might be in there a few days ... so we should grab anything important . I think she wants us to have something sentimental ... in case it goes south . You 're gonna introduce me to her one day . Thank you . For not trying to talk me out of this . SCOTT : So you 've just received what we 're calling the prototype decoy . It will , uh , bind to the virus and keep it occupied ... while your system creates the antibodies that it needs to defeat it . I 'll remind you that you 'll likely experience side effects similar to the early stages of the virus . So some headaches and fever and exhaustion . Just like a good hangover . Ladies and gentlemen , your entertainment for the next three days . [ ALL CHUCKLE ] Um , I would just like to say that ... you are all ... You 're remarkable people . And ... it is an honor to ... It 's an honor . Well , I 'll see you in there . THORWALD : Stop right there . - Stay where you are . WOMAN : I need Olympia . Please . Please . - Help me . - Don 't come any closer . I need Olympia . Please , help me . Stop right there . Please , take me to Olympia . THORWALD : Olympia can 't help you . - Please . Anyone in here ? Anyone in here ? Show yourself immediately . What the hell ? I thought you said this area was clear . It was . I don 't know how the hell she got through . THORWALD : Damn it , we need to tighten the perimeter . - Give me that . MCGREGOR : We 'll check again . All right , you heard him . Spread out . We need to go outside of the street . [ CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] This one 's for you , Bertrise . I still remember the first time you examined me . Well , that might just be because it was only three weeks ago ... and thankfully , you do not have Alzheimer 's . Oh . Heh , that 's some good news . - Family heirloom ? - Just something to keep my hands busy . Man of mystery . That 's a conversation for another day . Over ... what , martinis , maybe ? Let me guess . Shaken , not stirred ? Precisely , Moneypenny . [ CHUCKLES ] Oh , she hated that . Whoa . - You might actually be getting under her skin . - In a good way ? - Hard to tell . - Yeah . [ KARA CHUCKLES ] Old e-mails . From my boyfriend . Mickey , right ? That night at the vigil , you talked about him . Were you together a long time ? Uh , about a year ... if you count all the time we were at sea . - Systolic 120 . All good . - Thanks . I hope he treated you right . I , uh ... I 'm an only child . And my parents died on 9 / 11 . He 's kind of the only person who might even be missing me . Reminds me of when Sam was born . - He was a preemie , right ? - Five weeks in the NICU . All I could do was stand there , helpless . SCOTT : Is that your daughter ? Lily . It was her birthday last month . She 'd be 11 . - Do you have children ? - No . I never quite found the time for that somehow . Better not to have a child than to not be there when they need you . Well , if this all goes as it should , you 'll be back with her in a week or so . Oh , we 'll be back . No doubt about that . Uh-huh . Right . Thanks . So far , so good . That 's the word . I can 't believe this could really be it . Going home with a vaccine . Any idea what the plan would be for mass production ? - I heard talk about the CDC . - No , it 's too far inland . The captain 's thinking Fort Detrick , USAMRIID . The question is whether or not they have any power . - We could rig something to siphon off from ... GREEN : Hey . Let 's not jinx this , okay ? It 's only been six hours . - How am I doing ? RIOS : You 're fine . The fever 's your body 's way of working to adjust to the treatment . Hey . When Lily was a baby ... her temperature would run 102 every time she got her shots . My throat 's sore . Is yours ? No . But I feel like I can 't lift my arm . I 'm so tired . Everything all right , master chief ? Yeah , I 'm fine ... but Commander Garnett looks like she 's burning up over here . You should spend a little more time in the engine room . Everyone 's body reacts differently . It 's as we predicted . Hey - Come on , doc . Way below your pay grade . I got that . - Oh , no , Tex , that 's really not necessary . - Trust me , I can handle it . Hi , my name is Tex . I 'll be your server this evening . To start with , this fine cocktail of H20 ... served straight-up for your dining pleasure . - Master chief . - Thanks . GARNETT : What a gentleman . - Hello . I never got a chance to tell you . It was a nice eulogy for Cossetti . I don 't want any more funerals , Mike . SLATTERY : I think she 's got everything in hand . You were right about her . How you doing there , sugar ? Good . TEX : Good . - I 'm okay . I 'm seeing a future with the doc . Even if it is just carrying her water . Hey , come on , girl . Kara ? Kara . Kara . Doc . We got a problem . Kara . Kara . Kara . She 's not responding . Resps 32 , heart rate 120 . Kara , it 's Rachel . Can you tell me how you 're doing ? Kara ? All right , she 's seizing . Give me some room . [ MONITOR BEEPING ] SCOTT : Intramuscular Valium in . Give me fresh vitals . Seizure is at the three-minute mark . She 's febrile to 104 . How 's that line coming , doc ? - I 'm working on it . SCOTT : Work faster or give it IM . - Valium 's not working . RIOS : I 'm in . Sixty milligrams ketorolac , IV push . Three minutes , 30 . RIOS : Pulse ox is down to 82 percent . - Gotta lower her temperature . I need ice . Get me an NG tube . Approaching four minutes . - I got the ice . - Pour water over the ice and bring it here . All right . [ GASPS ] One-oh-three . One-oh-two and dropping . Everything 's all right . It was just the fever . Thank you , Bertrise . I 'll show you how to decontaminate your clothes on the way out . A hundred-and-four-degree fever can 't be from the prototype . So , what does that mean ? Is it the virus ? It 's possible we didn 't build a strong enough copy of Bertrise 's receptors . - The decoys could be breaking down . - We checked it a dozen times . We must 've missed something in her medical history . Repeat CBC and lytes on everyone . Add on LFTs and endocrine panels . That should tell us more than their blood work . He doesn 't seem convinced . In fairness to Quincy , he hasn 't been here . Is there anything you can give the others to help reduce the symptoms ? Quincy , give them 80 micrograms of interferon . Right . That should pump up their immune systems , just in case . Dude , you 're exhausted . Let 's just call it right here . I can 't . I can 't . I don 't know what I 'll do if anything happens to her . SCOTT : Open . - He went in after her . - What ? My father . He was a firefighter . He went into the North Tower . Jesus . You trying to cheer me up ? Anyway , that 's why I signed up for the Navy . Lieutenant Chung said you 'd want to see the latest engineering report . What can I say , doc ? I 'm a workaholic . My fingers . I can 't feel . Rub your fingers together . It will help the circulation . Tex , let 's lift up your shirt . - Garnett 's lost blood flow to her fingers . - She 's hypotensive . I 'll get the saline . SCOTT : This rash ... do you have any idea when it started ? No . It doesn 't itch . Well , you let me know if that changes . - See if you can get some rest . - Okay . I think you need to consider the possibility that the decoys aren 't working . We 've never seen the virus behave this way . But we haven 't been in the field with the virus for a very long time . We can 't know how the symptoms might have evolved . [ SINGING ] Hush , little baby , don 't say a word Mama 's gonna buy you a mockingbird Hi . Hi , Lily . Hi , honey . Oh , your hair is all in your face . You 're so pretty . And if that mockingbird won 't sing Mama 's gonna buy you a diamond ring They 're delirious . You make me wanna love again . If that cart and bull turn over Mama 's gonna buy you Baby , it 's me and I 'm ready . - Master chief ? JETER : Baby , I 've been strong . - I tried to be strong . - Sit down . JETER : I wanna see my girls . Where are they ? SCOTT : Get me a sedative . JETER : Sarah , Annie , my girls . - Master chief , let 's sit down . - Sedative . Master chief . Sedative . JETER : I wanna come with you now . - No , where are my girls ? SCOTT : Master chief ... Look at me , Russ . Look at me . You 're hallucinating . - Where are my girls ? CHANDLER : Focus on me . - Focus on me . It 's not real . JETER : Where are they ? I wanna see them . Annie , Sarah . Where are my girls ? RIOS : It 's all right , master chief . It 's all right . You 're just dreaming . You 're just hallucinating . It 's all right . It 's all right . Holy shit , did you see that ? Maya ? Maya ? Doc . Hey , doc . No . WOMAN [ ON RADIO ] : Significant progress has been made in treating the Red Flu . If you feel any symptoms , come to Olympia . We can help . You are not alone . Significant progress has been made ... Damn it . Do you think they really have a treatment at Olympia ? You remember when this whole thing started ? People were hoarding apple cider vinegar . Then they told us to rush to the hot springs because that 's a sure-fire cure . And now it 's Olympia . Whatever that is . Somebody 's gotta be making progress somewhere . It 's not true what you said ... that no one would miss you . I Will . I 'll make arrangements for the service . I want her given the Navy Cross . So these aren 't side effects from the vaccine , it is a virus . You 're certain ? - Yes . - No , he can 't be . Maya died from a heart attack , which is not a symptom of the virus . But liver failure is , and that 's what caused her blood pressure to drop . The fevers , delirium , hemorrhaging . There is no other explanation . There is one , we just haven 't found it yet . Whoa , whoa , whoa . - What 's your solution ? - MG passive immunization . - It could kill her . CHANDLER : Kill who ? Bertrise . He wants to use the plasma from her blood and inject it directly into the patients . - To give them her antibodies . SCOTT : No , Quincy . The amount of blood that we 'd need to take ... I 'm not willing to risk her life . Well , I 'm not gonna sit here and watch them die . You are too important , Bertrise . If it 's not the virus that 's causing this , it won 't make a difference . But if it is the virus , we can save them . We can manage it . If there 's a chance , we have to take it . I 'm willing , Dr. Scott . I am . How are you feeling ? Just a little tired . All right , take a sip of this . I 've got Kara 's test results . GREEN : Captain . I wasn 't sure it was my place to tell you , but if it were me ... I 'd wanna know . Kara 's pregnant . Hi , sweetheart . Danny ? Captain said we could have a visit . That can 't be good news . Don 't you dare leave me . Brief the crew . Anyone who wants to visit ... now 's the time . QUINCY : Rachel ? I just needed somewhere to clear my head . You were right . The MG hasn 't worked . Their symptoms ... they 're getting even worse . And Bertrise ? Dr. Rios is pumping her full of saline and FFP . She 'll be all right . Who did I think I was ... that I could solve this ? You 're the best there is . Yet I 've failed . Come on , we 'll find another way . God . [ CHATTERING ] Why did it work on you ? We never should 've let this happen . There wasn 't anything anybody could have done any differently . I 'm here to see Kara . Six people , Mike . Six . O 'CONNOR : Can you hear me , buddy ? Can you hear us at all ? Come on , Miller . We still need you , man . CHUNG : You , uh ... You gotta stick around , ma 'am . You know I can 't be chief engineer . CHENG Chung ? Come on . When they tell the story about the great plague of the 21st century ... they 'll talk about you . The six . [ DOOR OPENS ] SCOTT : Quincy ? Micro-cellular inflammation , oxidative stress , immune vascular dysfunction . And Bertrise , always sick when she was a kid and yet immune to this . - How could I have missed it ? - Can 't say that I 'm following you . What we 're seeing is an autoimmune response . The rashes , liver failure , the poor circulation . What happened to Maya was her own body attacking itself . The virus is adapting . Once it attached to the decoy , it changed shape . - It exposed its human gene . Neils ' gene . - That signaled to their immune systems ... to launch an attack on every cell in their body . The monkey doesn 't have human genes . It didn 't have the same reaction . So how do you stop it ? I need to modify the decoy and hide Neils ' gene . If our immune systems can 't see it , it won 't react . No . There is no way to get their bodies to manufacture ... the modified decoy on their own . Yes , there is . We use the Arctic strain as a Trojan horse . CHANDLER : You 're gonna be okay , buddy . We got this . It didn 't Work , did it ? Take a look . I was thinking it might be high time for the samba . - Tex . - The merengue ? - In bed . Now . - Oh , I thought she 'd never ask . [ ALL CHUCKLING ] Hey , Eng ? Put that down , relax . No , sir . [ SIGHS ] - Told you . - Yes , you did . Dr. Scott ? The baby ? Will be born immune . [ CHUCKLES ] JETER : I guess it was touch and go there for a while . How 's it going ? [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] [ LAUGHING ] Can we talk ... about what I hope ... is going on in there ? We have it . We have a vaccine . We don 't just have ... a vaccine . We have the cure . You mean ... ? I mean , that we can save people who are already sick . [ CRYING ] SAM : Grandpa , what do you think ? JED : Looking good , kiddo . Don 't forget the 151 on the hull . Thank you . [ STATIC ON RADIO ] JED : Mm ! Mm ! [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] - Uh ... - Hey , eat . JED : This is W6-ABH . This is Jed Chandler , Clearwater , Virginia . I 'm listening on 14.441 kilohertz ... looking for USS Nathan James . Captain Tom Chandler ... if you 're still out there , please , respond . Over . Looking for USS Nathan James .

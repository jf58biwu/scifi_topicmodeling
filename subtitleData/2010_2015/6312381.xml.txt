 What are you doing ? Oh , hello . Routine maintenance . It 'll just take a mo . Hang on . We do our own maintenance . What are you doing at Ian 's computer ? That normally works . You 're smart . DCI Taylor . We need access to this terminal under the Terrorism Prevention Act 2011 . This is a warrant and this is a document pertaining to the Official Secrets Act ... - ... which I 'm ... I 'm gonna need you to sign . - What ? Terrorism Prevention ... - And if I call the police ... ? - Yeah ... Of course . Here use my phone . The number 's 999 . No . Actually ... I 'll use our phones . If you think that 's best . Yeah . Yeah , I do ! Knew I 'd find it somewhere . Yeah , it 's me . Things have gone a bit awry . Yeah . Just one . I dealt with it . Well , we could say suicide , but it 'll be a bit of a stretch . Hold on . Yeah , suicide 's not gonna work . Becky ! It 's a long way down , Becky . I don 't think you should jump . My mum , my mates , everyone I know they all think I fucking killed myself cos of you and that bitch Milner ! What have I done to you , Jessica ? - Mi-e foame . Nu ai de mancare ? - Anton , let 's get you out . - Support V Day . - It 's political suicide . If you say no-one gets the vaccine until we all do ... so be it . There 's someone they want got rid of . They want you to do it . I want to help you , and I believe this is right , it 's just , uh , I don 't think I can . Do you think I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit ? I 've come to find you . Why ? We need to run . All of us . Right now . I made breakfast . It 's brown rice with pulses and nuts . It 's healthy . Well , I 'm not eating your food . It 's good you think like that . No , mate . I 'm not eating that , cos it 's fucking pigeon food . So , you said they wanted him ? So we can all just go , then ? What ? Becky ! They 'll have found your DNA at the factory . So , what do we do , then ? He knows something . If we want to live ... - ... we need to find out what he knows . - And why are you helping us ? I 'm turning over a new leaf . Ti-am facut tie ... mamei tale ... Oh , just fuck off , you dirty old nodger ! - He likes you . It 's good . - Yeah ? And you 're a psycho , mate . Are you sure it 's not Anton they wanted dead ? He knows all about Deel 's . You . Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? - Fran√ßais ? - They knew nothing about him . They would 've taken the decision to neutralise you within days . - Please don 't say " neutralise " . - What have you done in that time ? What have you done in the last few days ? - What have you been up to ? - Look , I 'm not an idiot . I 've kept my head down . I haven 't done anything that ... Well , I did see someone . But he was drunk . His name is Gorski , Dobry Gorski . My old professor . I went to see him on Tuesday to ask about Tony , but he was totally drunk . - Was he ever with The Network ? - Yeah , but he was out years ago . He 's dead . Dobry Gorski . I just googled him . Was hit-and-run this morning . What did he say to you ? Nothing that made any sense . What did he say ? He just said " Jimmy Deeshel is a fat man . " What ? " Jimmy Deeshel is a fat man . " - That 's it . - Who the fuck is Jimmy Deeshel ? No-one . There 's no Jimmy Deeshel . It 's not even a name . I googled it ! You googled it ? And someone tried to kill you ? I would suggest no-one googles anything from now on . I know someone who can help us . Let 's clean up and go . This is insane . It 's fucking nuts . Becky ? Look , what the fuck do you want ? Right , that 's everything back in place as best it can be . - We 're ready to go . - I missed you . I fucking missed you . I used to check CCTV feeds , missing persons ... I 'd walk out of the office in the middle of a meeting just in case you happened to be passing . Every second I missed you . And what do you say when you see me ? " What the fuck do you want ? " - Right , well , when you put it like that ... - Where is Jessica Hyde ? We don 't know . She had the manuscript , she took it to Milner . - That 's the last we saw of her . - Who 's Milner ? Ml5 . She was on our side . There are no sides , just people who help you and people who don 't . Yeah ? And which one are you ? Why the fuck are we trusting you ? - Ian , I don 't ... - We don 't know who he is ! He killed four men yesterday . How do we know they weren 't there to rescue us from him ? All this is over , The Network is finished and now you come along and you say that they 're after us ? But how do we know that ? How do we really fucking know that ? Um ... I think I can answer that . Police have identified the suspect as Ian Johnson . The victim , Joe Ducasor , an office manager from Peckham was brutally murdered in what police are describing as " a frenzied attack " . CCTV footage shows Johnson slashing the victim 's throat before fleeing the scene . You okay ? Joe was a cock . He was a real cock . - So ... - We 've got a car . It 's nice . - You can sit with me , Becky . - Yeah . Or I could just fucking not . I can 't explain that . All right . All right , I can explain it . I slept with him . Once . I 'd just found out I had Deel 's he knew all about it , I was at a very low ebb . It will never happen again and just thinking about it makes me want a vagina transplant . So I 'm just fucking telling you , all right ? It means us waiting a few months for the vaccine . so that they don 't have to wait decades . Isn 't that worth it ? Support V Day . Say , " No , not this time . " I asked to see her . Why can 't I see her ? - Because you 're seeing me , dear . - V Day is political suicide . I 'm on my way to be ... I can be PM . - Now , imagine how useful I could be if ... - We don 't need you to be PM , Geoff . We need you to announce that you 're backing V Day . We need it tonight . Just do what you 're told . - Please . - What is going on ? Where in God 's name is she ? Why isn 't she here ? She 's busy . She 's not moved . It 's been eight hours and she 's not moved a muscle . We have fabricated a worldwide flu scare . We are about to manufacture enough vaccine to inoculate the planet . But because you have kept us waiting we now have just under three months in which to do that . It 's just about ... just about possible . I wanted her to talk . - I thought she ... - Geoff announces V Day at 9pm . It 's a starting pistol . It 's a big red button with " go " on it . If Philip made an adjustment to Janus , we must know today . Let us operate . Let us go inside her brain . Tomorrow will be too late . She 's all I have left of him . Jessica ... We 're taking you somewhere else . I think we should be taking pieces of the optic nerve and chiasma and the medulla and the brain stem . The optic nerve ? Really ? I mean , if we 're going to be in there anyway . We could even take the dorsal surface of the thalamus . So , this is a very powerful sedative , Jessica . - Why am I bothering ? - Oh , no , no , no . I 'm not using these haemostats . These are a mess . - Do you want me to call the guard ? - Why wake him ? I just think the basic standards of hygiene in this place are not at all what they should be . Did you see what I did to him ? He 's drowning in there . I didn 't need to go that far . But I did to show you what I 'm willing to do if you don 't co-operate . Are you going to co-operate ? Yeah . I need a back way . Is there one ? Are you thinking ? Think fast . It 's through those doors there , at the top of the stairs . - Go on , then . - What ... ? What 's down there ? It 's medical waste . You know , blood , tissue , body parts soil pans . No , no , no . Please , please , please ... The-the dose , it has to be precise . It 's very strong . Please ... What part of my brain were you going to take again ? Oh , look , it 's that one-eyed freak who shot me in my lung . Yeah , well , you pulled my eye out ... Just doing my job . Besides , you 've got a nice , new , pirate-y look out of it . All I got was partial paralysis . - So we 're even , then ? - Even ? Oh , no . Not by a long shot . Christian Donaldson is on the run with Becky , Ian and Grant . - What ? - You need to go with Lee , find them . Me , with him ? Are you insane ? You know them . Besides , they may come to you , you were friends . We 're not friends now . And he is a fucking psychopath ! - Wilson ... - But me , with him ? Wilson , please ! Take care of this for me . I have other things to focus on . - Don 't worry , Wilson . - Whoa ! We 'll make a great team , you and me . I can do stuff , and you can keep an eye out . Are you all right driving , Wilson ? Only one eye ... Don 't you need to re-apply for your licence ? That 's not how it works . You need to inform the DVLA if you have a visual impairment and they will test you and decide whether or not you are fit to drive . In the majority of cases , it doesn 't affect your licence . - You did all that , then ? - No . I 've never had a licence . What I like about you , Wilson , is the amount of stuff you know . - All of it fucking useless . - Knowledge is never useless . Weren 't much use when I got my spoon out , was it ? Or when I killed your dad . This person will help us if he doesn 't know I 'm out . If he does know , he 'll try and call them . If that happens , get the boy out . There 's things he shouldn 't see . Is Ben home , please ? Ben ! Some friends for you ! - Are you all friends of Ben , then ? - Yes . Friends . Right ... Yeah , we 're ... we 're doing that thing . Perhaps we should talk in private . - Mum , have you seen my phone ? - Well , where did you leave it , then ? Here it is ! An honour . The inner sanctum . You 're so fucking embarrassing ! - He 's a kid ! - A smart kid . He 's with a hacking collective and he 'll help us . We 're popping out now , love . We 've left some food on the table downstairs . - It 's just cold ... - Just leave us the fuck alone ! - Is there food down there ? - Help yourself , blood . Thanks ... blood . Oh , by the way , if you want to steal anything - ... money , jewellery , TV - go for it . I fucking hate them ! We 're looking for someone . Jimmy Deeshel . What ? What did you say ? It 's not Jimmy Deeshel . It 's Jimmy Deesh ... L. The letter L. Jimmy Deesh was the nickname for a bio-weapons programme the Americans had in the ' 60s . Very top secret . L equals a project . Jimmy Deesh A , Jimmy Deesh B. What you 're looking for is Jimmy Deesh , Project L. And can you find out what it is ? Well ... that is some real dark-web infiltrating deep underground ... Yes . Yes , I can . This is deep . This project ... I can 't get near this . This Project L is ... Oh , my God . Oh my ... Oh , my God ! Who the fuck are you people ? Oh , I gotta get me some more of this . - It 's beautiful . - Oscar , this is slowing us down . Hey , sexy , how would you like an all-access pass to my bedroom ? Care to find out if those kinky naughty , dirty , nasty things I do behind closed doors ... - Oh , no , not you again ! - Come and meet my new friend . - Isn 't she gorgeous ? - Oi ! What are you doing , you dickhead ? Got it ! Fuck me , I got it ! This is some big-shit stuff , you know ? I mean , that was buried , man ! That was really ... Okay . Um ... Project L was something Jimmy Deesh was working on in 1968 . Now , bear in mind these are the same psychos that weaponised Ebola . But whatever Project L was , it scared them so much they didn 't even test it . I mean , once they created it , they just shit themselves . - And what was Project L ? - All I know is it was an H1N5 virus . So ... flu , I guess . Mate , you people are serious . I totally need a shit . Did your friend say , " Is a fat man , " or , " Is fat man " ? What does that matter ? Did he say Jimmy Deesh L " is a fat man " or just " is fat man " ? Er , no , he said , " Is fat man . " But so what ? He 's Polish . They don 't use prepositions . Ian ? What is it ? What is " fat man " ? " Fat Man " was the name of the bomb they released on Nagasaki . Of course , with so many videos going viral many ad agencies are trying to cash in on the phenomenon . What was once seen as the preserve of geeks and internet humorists is now becoming big business ... Pansh familii ! - Anton ? - Pansh familii ! Acesta este √Ænceputul ! Pansh familii ! Janus ... You 're all going to die . I didn 't do nothing , Becky ! He 's mental . He turned on the news and he just flipped . What ? Jessica 's gone . But ... we have to find her . We 've got to get her back . We 're not going to find her . It took me 35 years to find her . We are never , ever going to find Jessica Hyde ! You had her . You had her for five months and you did nothing , because of what ? - Sentiment . - Don 't push me , Leah . Because of who her father was and how you felt about him . What are you doing ? - I 'm calling Geoff . - I can fix this , please . - I 'm telling him not to announce . - No . No , wait . Let me think . What is there to think about ? There isn 't another version of this waiting in the wings ! There isn 't another Geoff or another flu scare or another vaccine or virus ! This is it ! - Are you all right , Michael ? - Oh , hi , Bridget . You look like a dog ate your sandwich . Got no idea what I 'm doing here . Well , I think you 're doing really , really well . Um ... the Russian flu vaccine ... Remember last week we had to postpone the tests because there was an issue with the SOPs ? Well , the results have all come back , and they are all stamped and dated everything is fine , blah , blah , blah . But the watermark dates say Wednesday . And the tests happened on Thursday . Oh . They must 've got the dates wrong . Well , that 's not possible because the system is linked to an atomic clock . It was a big publicity thing about a year ago . - So they just can 't be wrong . - So ... why is it wrong ? Well , that 's why you 're paid the big bucks . This vaccine thing ... it 's sorted . I mean , I 've got somebody onto it , so ... You know , let 's not ... Let 's leave it . You and me . I mean , until I ... know more . Right . But I ... I do know more . I pulled the previous reports on the vaccine over the last 18 months . Specifically the thermal stability observation . And it 's weird . Okay ? So it 's represented by a number between 1 and 900 taken every 18 days , right ? So it 's all ... fine . It 's just that when I compared it to other vaccines there was an exact match . Hong Kong flu , 1969 . - So , what , is that unusual ? - No . It 's impossible ! Someone must have taken the Hong Kong flu results and used them to fake the results for the Russian flu . This is ... serious , Michael . - This is really serious . - Wait . Hang on . - Let me ... Let me look at that . - Okay . Ah , right , well ... I see what 's happened here . I-I hate to tell you , but , er , you 're mistaken . - Oh . Am I ? - Yes . This ... this actually is the same , er , vaccine . See , you 've-you 've you 've pulled the observations for Hong Kong flu . Oh , yes . My mistake . W-What an idiot ! I want you to stay away from this ! You 're scaring me , Michael . But , please , j-just ... Look , there are things going on . I can 't tell you . Just ... don 't get involved , please ? Okay . Um ... That might be a bit late . I managed to get a sample of the vaccine , and I 'm running tests on it now . How the fuck did you get a sample ? Cleverness ? Breadcrumbs . I know where he 's going . So you can pickpocket . Handy . And I can see this time . And I can put a bullet right in your head . Did you really kill my dad ? Oh , yeah . It was me , all right . Why are you telling me that ? I put it somewhere . Oh , there it is . Right . You know what you are ? You 're a believer . That 's why she likes you . It 's not that you can 't take life I reckon you could take billions , but it would have to be necessary . Killing me just isn 't necessary . No ... No , don 't ... Don 't ! Don 't hurt them ! There are things I need to see to . Meet me here ... tonight . Be careful . He is just ... charming . I need new identities for three people . Old identities totally erased . Can you do that ? Me ? Er ... I can do birth certs . I can do passports I have a programme that plunders databases so thoroughly ... Sure . Come back tonight . So all this time they had a real virus ? - Russian flu is real ? - Yes , it 's real . And they 're going " Fat Man " on it . which is how they get a whole planet to take their vaccine . And if the results of the fake outbreak are modelled on the real thing think Spanish flu or worse . And was that one bad ? The Spanish one ? It killed 50 million people , Grant . Besides , we ought to be working on the bigger question here , hm ? Who the fuck 's he ? Grant , you said he spoke English . Does he speak English ? Hey , you . Why are we going to die ? Nai manush san ! It 's lovely , fantastic ! Who are you ? What do you mean ... - " Janus . You 're all going to die " ? - Oi ! He 's old ! No , he 's someone , okay ? He knows stuff ! - Why don 't you just leave him alone ? - Because people are trying to kill me . Because they 're going to do a Nagasaki with a flu virus ! You were told to leave it , so back the fuck off . I see . Fine , it 's fine , perfectly fine . I 'll just go and stand over here , shall I ? Wait for someone to kill me , shoot me in the fucking face because you 're all pals ? Ian ! Ian , quick ! What ? Did he do those ? Did he see it ? Is he copying them ? No . No , he 's not copying , he 's ... This is the house we were at this morning and that one 's Grant . And ... look at this . Fucking hell . Is he ... ? Philip ? Philip Carvel ? Oh , my fucking fuck ! But I thought he was dead . - Everyone thinks he 's dead . - Well , he 's not , is he ? He 's here , sat in our car , sketching . It 's not our car . - Well , I 'm just saying . It 's ... - Are you fucking kidding me ? You 're getting pedantic now ? Should we call Milner ? - Becky , should we call Milner ? - Listen , I don 't know what 's going on but Milner said that all this was over , and it turns out that that 's bullshit . And him he made my disease . He created it . I don 't wanna give him to anyone unless I 'm sure . I think we should keep this between us , Ian . Me and you . For now . All right , then . Just me and you . And I did miss you . It fu ... it fucking hurt , actually . Getting on that train was the worst decision that I ever made . I just wanted to say very big of you . Understanding me and Becky . Our past . Becky has told me everything . And if you think some sordid little bunk-up years ago means anything to me ... - ... you 've seriously misjudged me . - Oh , I wasn 't talking about the " bunk-up " . No , I was talking about the way Becky was trying to get the manuscript to me , you know ? Um , when she was with you all that time . The way she was secretly working with me to try and get the manuscript away from you . I just think it is great that you can forgive her , that 's all . - So you got it from this ? - Yeah . It 's just a nut from the machine that moves the tubs but because it doesn 't come into contact with the vaccine it 's not subject to the same security . And there was a study done last year that said that it was possible for vaccine aerosols to contaminate mechanical workings . So I had a look , and we were lucky . And you can test it here ? Yeah . I 've always had a home lab . I was born geek ! I 'm sorry , Bridget . I-I 'm sorry you got caught up in this . You seem like such a ... - ... good person . - Shut up . You 'll make me blush ! Actually , don 't shut up . I really like it when you say nice things to me . Saved by the haemagglutinin-sensitised erythrocytes ! Right ... Let 's see , let 's ... see ... Okay , yeah , yes . That 's all good ... Fuck , what 's this ? I think there 's something in here . What ? What 's in there ? There shouldn 't be anything in there . Well ... there is . I think it 's ... a protein , but it 's not one I 've seen before . Oh , my God . There is something in here . Right . Right , you just ... you just wait here . You ... Don 't call anyone , don 't go online . You just ... just wait there for me . D-D ... But ... Michael ? Are we gonna be okay ? We can 't just sit here . Hello ? Milner , it 's me . Ian ? - Ian , are you okay ? - I don 't know who to trust . - I thought I could trust ... - Ian , listen . This phone isn 't set up to trace calls . I can 't help you unless you tell me where you are . Ian ? Please ! The Network are running again . They 've just started manufacturing the vaccine . - Dugdale 's with them . - Dugdale ? We have Philip Carvel . - Carvel 's dead ... - No , he 's alive and he 's here . - No . No , no . That can 't be ... - Philip Carvel is alive ! Philip 's alive ? Ian , let me protect you . You 're in great danger where you are . You , Becky , Grant . You 're all in danger . - Let me help you . - What do you mean , " Becky " ? I didn 't say Becky was with us . Yes , you did . You said , " Becky " . Tell Geoff to announce V Day . Everything 's going to be fine . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Thank you very much for coming . Please do have a seat . I have an important and an exciting announcement to make . ... American Secretary of State said that China must not be allowed to turn its wheat crisis into a military crisis . But extended rain coupled with ... Well , I 'm alive . So I 'm assuming this is a negotiation ? I want to trade . I have Christian Donaldson and the others . But I want Amanda and Tess safe . Really ? This is about those two ? I 've new identities . Only I know them now . When it 's done I 'm coming for you . Fair enough , matey . But you should know , I 'm more important than I was . I can bring you back in . That 's all this is about . Bringing you home . We need to talk .

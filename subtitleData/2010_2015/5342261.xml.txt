( roaring ) ( LOW playing ) It must have been damn near 1 2 feet tall . We didn 't hear nothing except twigs . Then it just came upon us . It got Riley , just gutted him . It got Eddie . Ripped through the tent , knocked over the snowcat like it was a toy . You the one was attacked by the grizzly ? I 'm the one that survived . I 'd like to buy this man a drink . What 's your name , mister ? ( GROANS ) It 's Logan . And that 's a poison broadhead , which , last I heard , was illegal . ( GLASS shattering ) ( breathing heavily ) ( groaning ) Go ahead , ask me where l found it . ( groaning LOUDLY ) Ask me . Where did you find it ? Well , funny you should ask . I pulled it out of the back of a grizzly . Whoever shot it , didn 't have the wind or the balls to track the animal properly ... and put it out of its misery . ( GROANS ) instead of dropping a lethal dose of the poison ... it bled into the bear , made him crazy , killed five people . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Because I don 't dip my arrows in anything . In that case , you got nothing to worry about . ( GRUNTS ) Damn . That hurt . ( GLASS CLATTERS ) Sorry , Jean . I wouldn 't bother with them . Most of them will die soon anyway , without your help . Three of them , a week from now in the same truck .

Who are you ? Me ? I 'm Yukio . And ? I 've been trying to find you for over a year . Why ? To give you that . My employer wanted you to have it . Who 's your employer ? Master Yashida . He said it belongs to you , and that he 's paying all debts . Master Yashida is dying . He wants to say thank you for saving his life all those years ago . He knows that you are a ... busy man . But he very much wants to say his goodbye in person . All right , where is he ? Tokyo . Wait- - l 'm not going to Japan . It would be dishonorable for you to refuse his request . Well , apologize to Mr. Yashida , I 'm not going to Tokyo . All right ? I 've got things to do . Do not apologize . It 's been an honor just to meet the Wolverine . That 's not who I am anymore , you understand ? Interesting . Why did you go into that bar , if not to seek justice ? I don 't know . You don 't know . No ! I think you know . Pull over . You are a soldier . No , I 'm not . Pull over . You are a soldier . Pull over , now ! Now . ( BRAKES SCREECH ) You are a soldier , and you seek what all soldiers do . And what 's that ? An honorable death . An end to your pain . Who says I 'm in pain ? A man who has nightmares every night of his life is in pain . One day . I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida and I come right back . Okay . Fifteen hours . Depending on the wind . Fifteen hours ? You don 't like to fly ? I love it . ( EXHALES ) ( sighs ) We are almost there . So , you can see the future ? I can read a map . You said you knew the future of those assholes in the bar . I know they are going to die . We are all going to die . You said they would die in the same truck , in a week . If you 're right , that 's quite a talent . We don 't all have claws . ( sighs ) So , do I die on this plane ? No . Not on this plane . ( FEMALE ANNOUNCER speaking JAPANESE ON SPEAKER ) Master Yashida is not well tonight . ( radio CHATTER ) A lot of guns . There have been attacks . Attempted kidnappings . Attempted assassinations . By who ? The Japanese mob , the Yakuza . They 've grown strong as the government has grown weak . ( ALARM beeping ) ( ALL speaking JAPANESE ) Hip replacement . ( MEN GRUNTlNG ) Hey . This way . Who 's that ? Shingen , Master Yashida 's son . He 's good . He 's all right . ( BOTH greeting in JAPANESE ) So , what happened to the badass in boots ? Master Yashida is traditional . One eye on the past and the other on the future . ( DOOR LOCK BEEPS ) ( YASHlDA speaking SOFTLY in JAPANESE ) ( speaking JAPANESE ) That 's Mariko , his granddaughter . ( GLASS CLATTERlNG ) Mariko . ( speaking JAPANESE ) What 's wrong with you ? ( sobbing ) You haven 't answered my emails . I can 't tell you now . Yes , you can . Who is the caveman ? The man Grandfather wanted me to find . You can 't bring him in like that . Shizu and Saki are going to disinfect you . Give you a shave . Like hell they are . Get in the tub . ( sighs ) Whoa . Get in the tub . Really ? ( WOMEN shouting in JAPANESE ) All right . Okay . Okay . All right , all right , all right . I can do that bit . ( THUNDER rumbling ) What ? You look nice . I feel violated . DR.

Dr. Green . Leave us , please . Five minutes , no more . My oncologist . Well done . ( GROANS SOFTLY ) ( EXHALES ) YASHlDA : The painting is from the village of my birth . It depicts the bravery and skill of the Black Clan . Ninja warriors . They served my family for seven centuries . I didn 't send for you only to thank you , Logan . I wanted to repay you . To offer you something no one else can . A gift to equal the life you gave to me . I don 't need anything . Not a thing . Eternity can be a curse . It hasn 't been easy for you , living without time . The losses you have had to suffer . A man can run out of things to live for . Lose his purpose . Become a ronin . A samurai without a master . I can end your eternity . Make you mortal . What they did to me , what I am , can 't be undone . Yashida lndustries can do anything . We have reason to believe your ability to heal can be passed . Passed ? From you to another . ( sighs ) You have struggled long enough , Logan . I 'm confused . I came here to say goodbye to a man I once knew . I am the same man . I was not ready to die then . I am not ready to die now . But you are ... aren 't you ? Are you offering to kill me ? No . Not right away . You can live a long and ordinary life . Fall in love , have a family ... grow old . And one day , die an ordinary death . It can be done . Yeah , look , nice to see you again . Sorry you got sick . Please , Logan-san . I need you again . I fear for my family . ( HEART monitor beeping rapidly ) I fear for everything I have built . Enough . You should leave . Please , Logan-san . They 're going to kill her . Who ? Mariko , my granddaughter . She is my treasure . She must be protected . You don 't want what I 've got . ( monitor continues BEEPlNG rapidly ) Kuzuri . Kuzuri ! ( YASHlDA COUGHS ) DR. GREEN : He needs a sedative . Breathe slowly and calm yourself . ( SHlNGEN AND MARlKO arguing in JAPANESE ) ( MEN shouting in JAPANESE ) ( gasping ) Careful , careful . It 's slippery out here . Let go . ( panting ) You about done ? Let go of me . ( THUNDER rumbling ) He just wanted to say goodbye , huh ? You two grew up together . Yes . But you 're not her sister . No . Master Yashida found me on a trip to the South . He brought Mariko to see a factory he was building . I was digging through the garbage for something to eat . So they just took you home with them ? It was always difficult for Mariko to make friends . I 'll see to it the plane is ready in the morning . Sleep here . ( breathing heavily ) YASHlDA : Eternity can be a curse ... Kuzuri . YOUNG YASHlDA : You have no pain , Kuzuri ? How old are you ? JEAN GREY : Interesting offer . What are you doing turning the old man down ? I thought you wanted to be with me . Come here .

Your father was a good man . ( SCOFFS ) He would often say the same about you . But then , he was always fascinated with your kind . Tell me , why do you think he sent our little Yukio to fetch you ? To say goodbye . And now you have . Time for you to go back to your cave . ( GONG banging ) Anyone else you want me to meet ? ( speaking JAPANESE ) I pledge to you ... MasterYashida ... to be vigilant ... and to dedicate my life ... to protect Mariko . YUKlO : That armor belonged to Shiruba-Samurai ... the Silver Samurai . It will stand watch over the old man forever . Logan ? Hey . Something 's not right . Let go .

So what do they do , like , 300 miles an hour ? ( AMBULANCE siren wailing ) ( CAMERAS clicking ) ( REPORTERS clamoring ) ( speaking JAPANESE ) This cowardly attack was ... the work ofYakuza thugs . A violent response to my efforts ... to crack down on organized crime . They exited the North Gate . She was with the stranger - - Your gaijin friend , where is he ? Last I saw , he was protecting your daughter . ( SCOFFS ) You are a toy doll . A companion for a child who has outgrown you . Keep that in mind . ( SPEAKS JAPANESE ) So , where are we headed , Mariko ? Where are we going ? I 'm going to the end of the line . My family has a home in the South . That 's stupid . No offense , but they 're gonna know to look for you there . Not this place . You want to be left alone . Yes . I understand . Do you ? Oh , yeah . Trust me . Problem is , if I do that ... I don 't think you 're gonna live to see the end of the day . You can 't pretend shit isn 't happening when it is , princess . Unless you want to die . In that case , you 're playing this perfectly . ( GROANS ) ( sighs ) Oh ... What the hell ? ( GROANS ) ( breathing heavily ) Oh ... What the hell is happening ?

How do you know they were after me ? Look , we need to find someplace safe . We need to get off the streets . I don 't understand . Shut up ! Listen . Do you know this place ? Where 's downtown ? Straight ahead . So , where 's the nice part of town ? Another eight blocks that way . Good . We 're staying here . Let 's go . This is a love hotel . A what ? A love hotel . For couples , understand ? Uh ... Right . Hey . Uh , two rooms . Adjoining rooms , on the same floor . ( speaking JAPANESE ) Right next to each other . Very close . Same floor . Same floor . ( sighs ) ( speaking JAPANESE ) What did she say ? She has no rooms available next to each other . She 's asking if we prefer " the dungeon " , " the nurse 's office ... " or the " mission to Mars . " ( WOMAN giggling ) ( BED CREAKlNG ) This 'll do . MAN ON SPEAKERS : Liftoff ! We have a liftoff ! Kind of homey , actually . Where do you plan on sleeping ? I don 't . ( breathing heavily ) JEAN GREY : That 's a lot of blood . I thought you were done being the hero . But these guys were ... trying to kill her . Just let it go . It 's not hard to die . Come to me .

You may have cut him once or twice while he was stitching you . Okay , okay , okay . ( speaking JAPANESE ) Hey . Thank you . I never needed this before . What ? Help ? That doctor , the one who helped your grandfather , the blonde . Who is she ? He met her last year when he was in America for treatment . Your grandfather told me my healing could be taken from me , passed on . I 'm not getting better , not like before . She did this to me . MAN : Blondie ! ( MAN speaking JAPANESE ) Blondie ! How much ? How much , yeah ? How much ? ( PEOPLE gasping ) You kept me waiting two hours . You have no respect . So you haven 't found them ? Don 't play with me , bitch . I could kill you . If you could make me feel something , Harada , that would be sublime . I can slit your pretty mouth open , before you open it to say one more stupid- - Ah ... I asked you to do one thing , little man . Bring me the mutant . I don 't work for you . I work for the House of- - ( blowing air ) ( gasping ) You work for Yashida , I get it . Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish . My God , if you had any idea how much you have failed him . Where is Logan ? I am not done with him . ( gasping ) The mutant has powers . ( GRUNTS ) He 's just a man now . His flesh is weak now . I did that . I suppressed his power so he could be taken . You see , it 's me you should respect . ( GRUNTS ) Just find them , before the Yakuza . ( muttering ) ( GRUNTS ) We get off here . Where are we ? Just outside Nagasaki . This way . This is the guy from the funeral , the archer . He was your boyfriend . That 's Harada . We were village champions that summer . He with the bow and me with the knives . Harada and I were planning to get married . What stopped you ? Grandfather . He said we had to wait until we were at least 1 5 . From the mountain , from the sea . ( BOTH speaking JAPANESE ) ( sighs ) Chopsticks upright are a bad omen . It resembles incense at a funeral . Nothing is without meaning . So , the other night at the house , when you ran out in the rain ... what did that mean ? My grandfather was dying . You knew he was gonna die . He 'd been sick for a long time . It wasn 't his death I feared . So , what , then ? What did he tell you that night ? Mariko , why did your father hit you ? I was trying to warn him . About what ? What did your grandfather tell you ? He told me that ... in three days , when they read his will ... I will become the most powerful person in Japan . He gave it all to me . The company ? I didn 't want it . He knew that . I don 't understand why he gave it to me . It was all my father dreamed of . Well , that 's why . What about this fiancé of yours ? Nostromo . Noburo . Does he know about this ? No . Why are you marrying him ? He seems like kind of an asshole . My father arranged it last year . What ? It gives him a better access to the political theater . To disobey my father would be to dishonor him . I don 't expect you to understand . You 're not Japanese . ( SHlNGEN speaking JAPANESE ) Our island is long and thin . Trains only run in two directions . I assure you Lord Shingen ... my officers are making every effort- - Then they 're idiots . You 've wasted enough of my time . I have my father 's affairs to attend to . Get out and find her ! Tell me you have more promising news from your contacts . They open the will in three days . We are running out of time . Soon , I hope . I 'm sending men to the South . That 's where we found the bodies . ( YUKlO speaking JAPANESE ON PHONE ) lfthe Yakuza got into the funeral ... they had someone inside . They 'll neverfind me here . You 're not safe . I 'm coming down there . They 'll follow you . Please . Wait a few days . Please. I 'm fine . Logan 's here . He 's wounded , Mariko . ( WOMAN speaking JAPANESE ) Someone 's here . LOGAN : Mariko ? I have to go . Mariko ? ( WOMAN speaking JAPANESE ) A tree fell on the road . The men could use some help . ( ALL speaking JAPANESE ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( EXHALES ) Are you okay ? Tired . Do you need something ? No . ( BOTH greeting in JAPANESE ) This will help . ( airplane approaching ) It 's time . What ? Please . Take it . Thank you . No . Two hands . Japanese sword require two hands . Like that ? That 's it . It 's beautiful , Yashida . But I can 't take it . Please . Thank you . Keep it safe . Keep it safe for me . Someday , I 'll come get it . It 's time . ( gasping ) ( sobbing ) I was here when it happened . It 's how I met your grandfather . We hid in there . I heard the stories . My grandfather would say ... what happened here was proof that everything in the world finds peace . Eventually . That man can recover from anything . Maybe you , too . You don 't sleep very well . You call out in the night . Who 's Jean ? We should go back . There 's rain coming . ( THUNDER rumbling ) ( sighs ) This isn 't right . You need this tied like a proper samurai . Your grandfather called me a ronin . A samurai without a master . He said I was destined to live forever ... with no reason to live . Was he right ? Yes . Still ? Hey . What are you doing ? This isn 't going to end well . Everyone you love dies . ( BLADE UNSHEATHES ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPS ) ( panting ) ( YELLS ) Kuzuri . Do you know what that means ? An animal . A fierce creature with long claws and sharp teeth . It fears nothing . When I was a girl , I had nightmares . I 'd wake up and run to my parents . My father would get angry . ( speaking JAPANESE ) " Go back to sleep . Face your fears . " My grandfather was different . He told me stories about Kuzuri , his friend . Who he met at the bottom of a well . He said the Kuzuri was magical and saved his life . He said Kuzuri would protect me , too , as I slept in my bed . ( breathing heavily ) Who 's Jean ? is she like you ? What happened to her ? She died . I killed her . Along with the Kuzuri . Logan . Mariko ? MARlKO : Logan ! ( MAN shouting ) Logan ! Mariko ? Mariko ! MARlKO : No ! Logan ! No ! Logan ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) Mariko ! MARlKO : Logan ! No ! Logan ! Mariko ! Mariko ! Logan ! ( GRUNTlNG ) Where are they taking her ? Where , you piece of shit ? I no talk , gaijin . I never talk . ( MAN GROANS ) Who hired you ? Uh-oh . Take me to Noburo . Logan ... Take me to him . I need to tell you something . Do it . Now . You wait in the car . Logan . What ? I saw you die . What ? I saw you die . When ? Just now ? A while ago . But it 's not like I get a complete picture . More like looking through a keyhole . But I 'm always right . All I can see is one part of a person 's life ... their death . And I saw yours . So , what did you see ? I see you on your back . There 's blood everywhere . You 're holding your own heart in your hand . It 's not beating . I don 't have time for this shit . When I was five , I knew how my own parents would die . Then I watched it happen from the back seat . Look at me . A lot of people have tried to kill me , and I 'm still here . Yeah ... but you 're different now , aren 't you ? They can hurt you . They can kill you . Just wait in the car . I said , wait in the car . You need backup . You 're not safe , not in your condition . Just think of me as your bodyguard . ( sighs ) ( SLOW music playing ) ( NOBURO chuckling ) WOMAN : Sexy . ( NOBURO LAUGHS ) NOBURO : Come on ! WOMAN : I 'm coming . ( speaking JAPANESE ) ( ALL laughing ) WOMAN : Okay , round four . Here we go . ( NOBURO speaking JAPANESE ) WOMAN : Drink for you , my lady . ( BOTH SHRlEKlNG ) Get out . ( music STOPS ) Not you . Call me old-fashioned ... but I thought being engaged meant you were done with this kind of bullshit . I am the Minister of Justice . Do you have any idea what I could do to you ? Really ? You 're gonna try and talk tough , standing there in your red underwear ? You have ten words ... ten words ... to explain to me why you , the Minister of Justice ... would want your fiancé killed by the Yakuza . If I don 't like what you say , you are going through that window . You don 't have the faintest idea what 's going on- - ( GROANS ) How many words was that ? Nine . Nine . You have one word left . Really ? ( GRUNTS ) Shingen . Shingen ! Keep going . Since he got sick ... old man Yashida spent billions on doctors , healers . Stockpiling adamantium at his lab in the North ... secretly trying to prolong his life . He brought the company to the edge of bankruptcy . He was obsessed with you . ( speaking JAPANESE ) ( GROANS ) English ! Shingen lied , protected the old man ... concealed the debt from stockholders and the board . He tried to be a good son and thought he 'd be rewarded . And then the old man left everything to his granddaughter . If Mariko got all that power , she would dump his ass . It 's true . Mariko would have never gone through with the wedding ... not once the will was revealed . She never took to me . Oh , really ? A class act like you . Shingen promised me a fortune for my help . So , you put a hit on his daughter . is that it ? Political careers don 't last forever . That 's right . Wait ! Wait ! No ! You wanted the truth . I told you the truth ! I didn 't like it . Wow . How did you know there 's a pool down there ? I didn 't . ( SPEAKS JAPANESE ) Did you know I studied biology in college ? Genetics . There are genes that skip generations . Recessive genes . Eyes . Eyes . Hair . Talent . Temperament . Not every child gets the same . My father saw little of himself in me . But in you ... he faced a mirror . How did you convince my father ... to award you control ... ofasia 's largest corporation ? You 've gone insane . I 'm just waking up . Ifyou kill me , you will lose ... what little honoryou have left . Fear not Mariko . I don 't want to hurt you . I want to help you . Help you end your pain ... what that mutant stopped you ... from doing last week . I neverwanted to die , Father . ( GASPS ) ( speaking JAPANESE ) ( HARADA speaking JAPANESE ) lt 's alright , Mariko . ( gasping ) Come with me . What is happening ? ! More than you can imagine . You . Me . Sorry to interrupt , but I need your daughter alive . What are you ? A chemist , a nihilist ... a capitalist , a mutation . A viper . ( CHOKES ) ( GROANS ) ( YELLS ) Where is the security ? Shingen ? ( breathing heavily ) Logan . This . This here . Where is this ? Master Yashida 's birthplace . The company built a facility into the mountainside . How far ? 500 kilometers from here . ( BEEPS ) ( breathing heavily ) ( GRUNTS ) ( electronic WHlRRlNG ) I gotta get that thing out of me . How ? No , stop , Logan . I saw you die . I 'm never wrong . I 'm never wrong . You 're not always right . You didn 't know the old man was gonna bite it . I saw you die in a room like this with your heart in your hand . I can 't leave her with those freaks and killers . I 'm the only chance she 's got , but not with that thing inside me . You 're going to die , Logan . Maybe that 's okay . ( GROANS ) No , listen to me , Logan ! No , stop . Logan ! You 're not gonna want to watch this part . ( groaning ) No ! Listen to me ! Please , no ! No , stop . Listen to me . Logan ! ( SNlGGERS ) Move ! ( YELLS ) Stay away from him . ( LOGAN screaming ) He killed your master . Put hands on your sister . And now you want him ? ( ALARM blaring ) Oh , no. I can 't see . You 'll always be a beggar . You 're crazy . LOGAN : Oh , no . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( groaning ) ( gasping ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( BEEPlNG ) Yukio . ( groaning ) ( EXHALES ) ( HEART monitor FLATLlNlNG ) Logan ! ( YUKlO yelling ) Logan ! Logan ! Logan ! Don 't hit my friends . Where 's Mariko ? She 's gone . That Viper bitch took her . It was my father 's obsession ... with mutation , with God 's mistakes ... like you and her , that ruined this house . ( BOTH grunting ) You tried to kill your daughter . Live with that . ( yelling ) What kind of monster are you ? The Wolverine . Hey , come here , come here . That 's it . I was wrong . I told you . Let me have a look at you . It 's nothing . Hey , thank you . It 's a trap , Logan . ( MARlKO speaking JAPANESE ) Why have you brought me here ? What are you hiding ? You will soon find out . Welcome , Mariko . It 's all right , Mariko . She also serves the House of Yashida . MARlKO : She serves herself . She infected Logan . Hmm ... And what about Grandfather ? What did you infect him with ? I granted his dying wish . I helped him rest . Now , it 's your turn . ( GASPS ) ( speaking JAPANESE ) viper : Did you have a nice rest ? I don 't know what you said or did to deceive Harada or my grandfather- - Now , now , calm down . Your grandfather sought me out . I am the head of this family now . And why do you suppose that is ? Why do you think the old man chose you ? Because you are strong ? Or because you are weak ? I see you 've come to fight . It 's pointless . You 're weak . You 're outnumbered . The Black Clan has protected the House of Yashida for 700 years . is that all the men you brought ? I 'm gonna get her . We are grateful for your protection of Mariko . But there is one more sacrifice you must make for her family . Go fuck yourself , pretty boy . ( BOTH grunting ) ( shouting in JAPANESE ) ( MEN shouting ) ( shouting in JAPANESE ) ( groaning ) ( MEN shouting ) Logan . ( groaning ) ( GROANS ) KAYLA : Logan . LOGAN : Kayla . I love you . Kayla ! Logan . ( LOGAN GROANS ) MARlKO : Logan ! LOGAN : Mariko ! Jean . JEAN GREY : Save me . ( breathing heavily ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( GRUNTS ) ( panting ) Stand back . There is no need . Where is she ? Where 's Mariko ? Where is she ? " Where is Mariko ? " Still pining away ? That 's so sweet . Impressive , no ? He is made of adamantium , just like you . ( GRUNTS ) Oh , Logan , you know what , I get it . You 're frustrated . I know she 's here . I want to see her . You want answers . Yes , I want answers ! I 'm sorry , I wish I could say more , but I was hired in part for my discretion . I 'm sure you were . That ... and a certain talent for combining biochemistry and metaphysics . High-grade toxins are my specialty . It helps to be genetically immune to every poison known to man , as I am . And immune to the toxin that is man himself ... as I am .

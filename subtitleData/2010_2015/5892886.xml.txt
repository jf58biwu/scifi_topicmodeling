 Previously on The 100 ... Welcome to Mount Weather . Anya ? Ok , come on . There has to be another way . There isn 't ! Thank you . You killed 300 of my warriors . I can 't show my face without a prize . The Grounders took them . The guy with the one eye . He 's got Clarke 's watch . Where is the girl who was wearing this watch ? ! Let 's get moving . Are we really going to do this ? Bring the Ark to the ground ? Godspeed , my friends . There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles . * * * It 's a missile . Our ancestors used them to destroy the world . We 're gonna use one to get back to it . Anya , we 've been walking for hours . - Where are we going ? - Quiet . Why not just kill me and get it over with ? You can tell the commander what the mountain men are doing to us in there . So let 's work together . We don 't have to be enemies . And unite with someone as weak as you ? - I have what I need . - Hey . We both want the same thing . - Get down . - They found us . Run . Everyone , eyes peeled . We 're in Grounder territory . Everything is Grounder territory , all right ? I can 't keep running , all right ? We don 't even know if the guy Finn killed was telling the truth . Keep moving . - We can give him a minute . - No , we can 't . You heard what that Grounder said . " They 'll outlive their usefulness . " I heard what he said when you had a gun to his head . Look , you think I wanted to do that ? He would have told his people we 're coming , and by the time we got there , our people would be dead . Maybe that 's something you can live with , but I can 't ! Hey , you did what you think you had to do , but you are not yourself right now , and I can 't be out here with another loose cannon . Guys . Fall in . Where the hell did they come from ? From the Ark . It 's a rough landing . There 's nothing we can do for these people . We got to go . Did you hear that ? Hey . Hey , someone 's down there . - Hey ! - Please ! Up here ! Please , help me ! Mel ? Help me ! - You know her ? - Shut up , Murphy . She 's my friend . We have to do something . Help me ! Sterling , please ! We can 't stop . This isn 't a Grounder , Finn . - We have a rope . - You saw her . She 'd never be able to hold on to it . We 'd have to lower somebody down . It 'll take time that we don 't have . - I hate this as much as you ... - I know . I ... I know . Ok , I know . Just hold on ! Just hold on , Mel . Sterling ! We 'll come back for her . Ok ? Please ! We 're movin ' out . - Wait ! Sterling ! - Hey ! I can 't hang on ! Well , it looks like we 're taking that break after all , huh ? Be advised , the fence is live . Copy that . Ladies and gentlemen , the fence is hot . Trust me , you do not want to go near it . Careful . Reyes , there you are . Yes , sir . Dr. Griffin cleared you for work . How 's your leg ? It 's not a factor . What 's the job ? Need you to build a radio beacon . If the other Ark stations have survivors , we need to know it . I 'm on it . I got it . Ok , report to engineering and we 'll get you started . Roger that . Thank you , sir . Drein daun . Drein daun . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Hey . Wait , just a se ... _ Ah . Mmm . Ah . Thank you . What 's your name ? Your name . You . Zoran . Zoran . Good name . I 'm Thelonious . - Thuh-lawn-us . - Yeah . Thee-lo-noose . _ _ - _ - _ _ Please , I mean you no harm . Strangers are not welcome here . Please ! I 'm injured ! Please ! Quiet . You can 't even walk in the woods . If I 'm such a burden , then cut me loose . Heavy footfalls , broken branches . You even smell like them . Down . No . Not to drink . Then why stop ? We should be running . You reek . Cover yourself in it . I 'm almost there ! Once I have her , pull us up ! Well , I 'd say he 's heard one too many - of your motivational speeches . - Shut up , Murphy . Give me your hand . It 's ok , Mel . Ok . I got you . All right . Ok . I got you ... All righty . I got you , ok ? Give me your hand . You 'll be all right . I got you . - Sterling ! Sterling ! - Aah ... Mel ! Mel , hold on . Focus on me . You can do this . Oh , no ! Yes , you can . You 're strong . I 'm not strong ! Stubborn , maybe . So be stubborn a little longer . I 'm not gonna let you die , you hear me ? Ok . - We 're out of rope . - So we make a new one . If anything happens to our friends , when we could ... We don 't know if we could save our friends . For all we know , they may be dead already . We 've all thought it . But what we do know is we could save this one girl . Sterling was one of us . She was his friend . I 'm in . How do we do it ? We make new rope from the wreckage . Go find wires , seatbelts , anything . Come on . Come on . I hope you 're right about this . So do I. You said I wasn 't welcome here . Zoran 's father thought I should let you stay . Then I should thank him . He is gathering supplies . You speak English . I was aiming for the eastern United States . Did I make it ? This is the dead zone , on the way to the city of light . I am Sienna . You must eat , then rest . Good . Mmm ! Thank you . - Is the city of light your home ? - It will be , if we can find it . _ Oh , God . Zoran ! I ... I 'm sorry . He surprised me . We 're used to the hatred . I have no room for hate . What happened to him ? He was born that way . It happens sometimes . Radiation . Fate . When such a child is born , we leave it out , let nature reclaim it , to erase the stain from the bloodline . How could you do that ? That is our way . I knew what was expected of me . I could not give up my child . We left our home so that he might live . You chose to leave your people ? He is my son . What the hell are you doing in here , wrench monkey ? Helium , Wick ? Really ? Ark welders aren 't toys . Come on , Reyes . You got to enjoy life . You enjoy enough for everybody . So , still dreaming up designs the rest of us will have to fix ? Hey , my designs are elegant . If only they were realistic . Well , it 's been real , but I have a beacon to work on . In that case , welcome to my party . Schematics are over here on the bench . You already designed it ? Yep ... We 're using parts we salvaged - from the station 's debris field . - Obviously . Oh , also , I have a little something for you . What a piece of crap . You 're welcome ? I can get around just fine . What you need to worry about is countering the mountain effect . That 's your job . Damn engineers . Damn mechanics . How are they still following us ? Because of you . Time to end this . Anya , I am stepping where you step . I 'm covered in mud . We 're not leaving a trail . They 're following something . They 're not following us . They 're tracking us . Search yourself . If I 'm right , it should feel like a ... a small bump just under your skin . Oh . It 's you . Ok , I could remove it , but you need to untie my hands . I just need something sharp and sterile . Aah ! I will not go back there . All right . Ease it out slowly . Just hang on . I 'm almost there . It 's ok . I got you . I got you . Just put your arms around me . - I can 't . - Yes , you can . It 's ok . This will hold . I 'll get you up . I promise . - Ok ? - Ok . Ok . I got her ! Pull us up ! Don 't you worry , Bellamy . I won 't drop you . Just pull , Murphy . Hey . I 'm changing the tone frequency to 400 hertz . It 'll increase the radiated modulation depth . Atmospheric noise will screw us . So the signal 's fainter . At least they 'll know we 're out here . What 's wrong ? The current is not getting high enough . We might as well be shouting into the wind . We put an insulator between the mast and capacity top hat . Already tried that . Not working . Then you 're doing it wrong . - Raven . - Don 't worry . I 'll fix it . I always do . - Try my damn brace ! - Your damn brace sucks ! Come on , Raven . Elbow grease ain 't gonna fix this . What would you know about elbow grease ? Hey , come on . Let 's go back to the work room . We 'll think it through . Leave me alone , Wick ! Rrr ! Pull , Murphy ! Aah ! Come on ! A little help ! Oh , no ! Pull ! Pull ! What the hell is happening up there ? ! Just hold on ! Grounders ! Cover ! How many are there ? We can 't see ' em ! In the trees ! In the trees ! Aim for the trees ! Aah ! No , no , no ! Just hang on . Aah ! We 're gonna need to cut her loose . We can 't do this . - Bellamy , you got to cut her loose ! - No way ! Cut her loose ! Acid fog . Monroe , get back on the rope ! Come on ! Thank you . Thank you . We have to take cover from the fog . Bellamy . No , we don 't . She blew the horn . Octavia . Bring me down , Reyes . Hey , you know why you 're working on the beacon ? I 'm not . Find someone else . Because I asked for you . You 're the best mechanic we got . Go , me . Exactly 3 mechanics made it to the ground . You were top-3 on the Ark , too . I say this even though you refuse to acknowledge the ingenuity of my designs . - Stop . - Or insanity . Listen , you have a first-rate mind . You do . Use it . Your leg 's messed up , and that blows . Figure out a way to work around it . How do I do that ? You could let your friends help , for one . The rest , it 's up to you . What do you know ? - It holds . - Barely . Oh , whatever ! My design worked ! You can admit it ! Whatever . This thing 's an offense to mechanics everywhere . You 're welcome . - Helium . - Argon ! What ? Are we not just tossing out noble gases ? No , you idiot ! I know what we have to do to raise the beacon . Zoran . Zoran , please . Come on . Come on . Please . And you don 't ... you don 't need this for me . I have something for you . What is it ? So you do speak English . Not to strangers . - It 's all right . - Heh ! Well , we 're not strangers anymore . It 's called a chess piece . The black knight . The game teaches long-term strategy . Taught my son how to play when he was about your age . Where is your son now ? Dead . I chose different from you . I put my people first . Your people must be very important to you . So was my son . Anya , you 're still bleeding . At least let me bandage it before it gets infected . I can find my way home from here . Looks like you 're my prisoner now . You must go ! Quick ! Come with me ! Come with me ! There . Look at the ridge . - Who are they ? - Bad men . They 're coming for you . No one comes to the dead zone . They must have seen you fall from the sky . You have to run , now . If they expect to find me , - what happens to you if they don 't ? - Go ! Go before they see you . We can take care of ourselves . Thank God you came when you did . I was going back to camp when I heard shots . Nice foghorn . What happened to your boyfriend ? He 's gone . All right . Hey . I 'm sorry , O. The Grounders will be back , so we need to go , now . Yes , we do . Octavia says the arrow might be poisoned . I have to take them home . I know . I 'll meet you as soon as I can . I know . Parting , such sweet sorrow , right ? Where the hell do you think you 're going ? Come on . Bellamy , you know if I go with you , they 'll just lock me up again . Really ? Watch his back . I can 't get them home without you . Of course you can 't . Let 's go . Anya , wait . Aah ! Aah ! Hey ... Aah ! I don 't want to kill you , Anya . Then you 're the one that 's gonna die . Aah ! You fought well . Do you see that ? I knew it . He lied . My people are out there . So the balloon beacon wasn 't a bad idea . I think the word you 're searching for is " genius . " You should have been an engineer . You already have the arrogance . Oh , that 's what they teach you . I wondered . Well , that 's one way to do it . What the hell are you doing ? Oh , it 's a radio beacon . Wrong . It 's a target . Hey , wait a second ! We fell from space in a football stadium ; I think they already know we 're here . Chancellor Kane 's out risking his life to negotiate with the Grounders . You better hope he 's successful , because if he isn 't , every Grounder within 50 miles of here now knows exactly where we are ! I expected better , Chief . All guards to the wall , now ! You see a Grounder , you 're authorized to shoot on sight ! - Yes , ma 'am . - Let 's go ! Cover the perimeter ! Move ! He won 't run ! Please ! They 'll hurt him ! If he runs , they 'll hurt us . Father ? He brought the bad man here ? _ Mother , why are you doing this ? It 's ok , Zoran . Listen to your mother . You can still run ! Please ! If I do , that man will hurt your family , and I won 't let that happen . There is a bounty on sky people . " Sky people " ? We needed the horse to reach the city of light . Yeah . To survive , we do what we must . I hope you find your new home . Look at that . How many are there ? I don 't know . A lot , I hope . I 'm letting you go . I 'm not weak , but I 'm not like you . Our only chance against Mount Weather is if we fight together . To beat them , we 'll need our technology and your knowledge of this world . I know my people will help . The question is , will yours ? The commander was my second . I can get an audience . Please hurry . Anya ! Hey . Hey , hey , hey . No , no , no , no . No , no . Hey . It 's ok . No . No , no , no . Anya , you 're ok . You 're ok . Shot two more . Alpha team 's got two Grounders down .

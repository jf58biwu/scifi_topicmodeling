 Deia ! Deia ! The Landmates are in perfect synchronization . as requested . I see ... The neural load is at its limits . I can 't guarantee your safety at any higher levels ... Just one person left ... Alcides ... A bioroid of me ... Yep . It will be at your beck and call from now on . Deia . I 'm sure you 'll make a great partner . I have high hopes for you . Alcides . Alcides . You should have the bioroid handle things like that . after all . I fully understand that . But ... Bioroids aren 't human . I will still obey and eradicate the bioroids . The goal of Olympus' ultra-long-term Ark Project is to have bioroids conduct deep space exploration . The passengers will be arriving at the spaceport for tomorrow 's journey into space . who is currently residing in Olympus has commented by saying that she has great hope that this will usher in a new future for all bioroids . It 's believed that this exploration will be a big step in solving the natural resource problem . Deia ... Are you really the friendly neighbor I used to know ? Or are you a vile destroyer of paradise ? Just try and stop me . I will stop you ! It seems you 're the last unprocessed bioroid left with Alcides ' genes . Prime Minister . I fully believe I 'm the most qualified for this . I see . then that is how it will be . Yes ... 150 multi-legged turrets have already been deployed around the Argonaut . Multi-legged turrets ? New model Auto Insectors . Talk about some serious firepower ... ES.W.A.T. will provide air support while the Auto Insectors cover things on the ground . Grow strong ! Pollux . Brother ... right ? Wow ! Brother ! But I 'd actually like that more . Not until you 're a grown-up . But you 're still a kid too ... you . What do you think 's going on ? The Argonaut is smack dab between Olympus and the spaceport . So it 'll serve as the base of operations for Eurys ' security detail . Sir ? That 's just asking for a surprise attack . That 's precisely why we need to secure it . What will the Poseidon ambassador be doing ? Apparently they won 't disclose that info . Sounds like Poseidon 's going to handle her security . What a pain . Can 't we monitor her ourselves ? We 're going to have an FBI agent on board . Ambassador ? Very well . Everything is progressing just like you wanted . You 're about to make yourself a hero ... Are you excited ? and Poseidon will gain the trust and benefit of the old superpowers . That 's our business deal . Deia ... Don 't strain yourself . This isn 't about Deia . The Bronze Bird incident proved that Poseidon is secretly pulling the strings . then I feel like she isn 't through yet . she probably has a personal grudge against Olympus . There 's no way for us to know just who she really is and what she 's done . But the Deia we 're faced with now is unquestionably our enemy . A vile terrorist . The envoy 's private plane will be taking off shortly . Surroundings ? Clear . All right . Deploy the Guges Ds . Commence operation . 109 . 113 . Commence operation . over . over . The ambassador 's actions remain unchanged . Still en route for Poseidon via scheduled course . Continue to monitor her . Understood . Ambassador ? Ambassador ? The Poseidon plane ? What about the ambassador ? A naval search is underway . To think that they would take direct action ... What are they thinking ? The project 's failure would be disadvantageous for Poseidon as well . Perhaps Poseidon isn 't responsible . You mean a personal vendetta ? That 's absurd . What would she be left with ? then it all fits . Might the eradication of Alcides' genes have been her real aim all along ? I assume none of the candidates genes are backed up in Tartaros ? Correct . They were disposed of due to the cryogenic problems that arose after the skyjack incident . Only the genes in Eurys are left . So she 's willing to embroil the whole world in this just to strike a single target ... What is it ? Gaia requests a meeting . Gaia does ? The Poseidon plane has been attacked . And the ambassador ? ! Currently missing . A search is underway in the surrounding waters . Keep a sharp eye on the envoy 's plane ! I 'm here . I hear the Poseidon plane 's been shot down . I thought our business deal was finished . The deal between you and me was . She 's running the show now . Ask her for the details . Professor Leon ? ! I 've found you . The plane 's anti-satellite cloaking system is being disabled ! What ? ! The security control net is being hacked ! What is it ? ! The Auto Insectors ! Our home ! Brother ! Yeah . It 's no use ! It 's continuing to hack into the control network ! We can 't pre-empt it ! It has the processing power of a Hekatoncheires ! A Hekatoncheires ... Deia 's nearby ! 113 ! 109 ! Take out the enemy Hekatoncheires ! Roger ! We 're counting on you . Briareos ! Just try and stop me . Deia ? ! I will curse god and end the bioroids . I 've disposed of all the frozen embryos that were in here . Now 3000 people 's worth of Alcides ' genes just go poof . Good work . I 'll handle things from here . Found her ! 0800 hours ! Don 't get hasty . You 'll leave yourself open . I 'll cover your blind spots . With all the eyes I have ? Even with them you can 't see everything ! Here she comes ! Deia ! This place should be safe . Now just stay here and hide . What about you ? I 'm gonna take a look outside . Don 't worry . I have this . Stay right here . Mm ! Those bastards ! I won 't let you get in my way ! Briareos ! I won 't let you get in my way ! Brother ... What happened to Alcides ? ! Deia . Well done . The envoy 's plane has cleared the danger area ! Disarm immediately ! It 's over . You can 't chase him anymore ! Yes ... It 's over . The envoy 's plane ... It 's been shot down ... The other Landmate ... Alcides ... I am a sinful woman who has betrayed my husband and brought ruin to the Argonauts ...

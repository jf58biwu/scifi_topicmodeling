It 's a plan to increase the total population to half a million people in six generations or roughly one hundred years . Do you know how hard raising children is ? But what about the food supplies ? We can 't possibly sustain so many people after a war . Professor Yure ! There 's no need to worry . 360 ) } Strategy to Increase Sidonia 's Population 100 year projection ( six generations ) These children will not be a burden . They will photosynthesize ! Grandma .

It 's a pleasure . but a Gauna 's Ena that has been separated from the core before the core is destroyed will continue to live on its own . we don 't know for how long . It 's the first time a Gauna has actually recreated a human being so completely . Excuse me ... Why exactly did Nagate get called here ? For a test . A test ? To see if it has human-like intelligence or not . but why Nagate ? it said Tanikaze 's name . What ? Your name ? 286 ) } Barrier Wall 3 all right ? Okay . Hoshijiro . It reacted ! Hoshijiro .

Were you actually able to learn anything from it ? It 's recreated something that is very close to human . as well . Emotions ? The thing is ... The Garde-form Gauna that retreated moved like it could only have been piloted by a human being . The mere fact that Gauna actually possess human-like intelligence ... it changes things . it changes everything when it comes to our strategy . how ? It would make it a lot easier if those things were human . we wouldn 't lose . You rely on the Heigus particle cannon far too much . Huh ? but don 't forget that Heigus particles are also the source of the Gauna 's energy . Do me a favor . Let 's make this quick . I need to get three assists to win a photosynthesizing session for two with Samari . I 'm never photosynthesizing with any of you . Nagate . I 've done exactly as you have ordered .

Is that really safe with the Gauna cluster so close to us ? the people who get on the colony ship believe that the Gauna won 't attack them if they don 't have any Kabizashis . That 's not very likely . And to think we actually have to share our resources with idiots who would believe that . Such a waste . won 't it ? but it will ultimately lead to less manpower on Sidonia . Our military forces are dwindling . It won 't be long before we ... Yeah . I know . Everybody 's talking about the colony ship . Yeah . They all have a different opinion . I wish I knew what was gonna happen . Nagate ? I am . Then give me an answer ! What ? Well ... Tanikaze !

The Extraterrestrial Research Division is full of secrets . And the research on the Gauna 491 Ena specimen was given the highest priority . It 's really difficult to ignore their demands . I see .

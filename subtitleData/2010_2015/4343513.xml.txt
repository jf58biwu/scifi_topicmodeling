 Previously on Heroes ... - Get out of my head . - This is a dream . - It 's not a dream ! - I came to take you out of here . In the dream , Emma , my friend ... You save her before she kills thousands . You really think you can get us out ? Let me see you try . Charlie was my heart , my world , my happily ever after . I did everything I could to try and save her life . Where is Charlie ? I 'm the only one who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . - Help him . - It 's our intent to prove that he abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly . Showing my dad 's memories is gonna enlighten me ? - Don 't do this . - You 're afraid she 'll see the real you ? - You brought a gun . - I was scared . First time you ever killed . You actually thought that I would turn on him ? Claire Bennet needs some time to think about my offer . It 's time to gather the family . We 're moving on to bigger things . The greatest show we 've ever done . Dad ? I 'm here . No signal . - You okay ? - Yeah . You ? Yeah , help me get these ropes off . A lantern over there ? We 're buried . - How far down we are ? - It felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet . Can anyone hear us ? Anybody hear us ? Help ! Can anybody hear us ? - Anybody up there ? - Somebody help us ! Help ! Can anybody hear us ? Can you hear us out there ? How long has it been ? Half a day , maybe . Feels like we were in there for years . - Is your buddy Samuel here with you ? - Came alone this time ... so to speak . - What do you want ? - Samuel asked me to make sure your friends downstairs aren 't a problem for us . I guess that means you too . Sorry to break up the lovefest . Come on . You 're having doubts . Look at you . Come on , I can tell . You don 't want to do this . What I want doesn 't matter . I have no choice . Don 't bother . We got you outnumbered . You want to leave , right now . Are you trying to push a thought ? All but one of us are pretty ... thoughtless . Tonight will be a night unlike any other . Tonight ... we change everything . We 've been shamed into believing we 're second-class citizens . When the truth is , we 're king of the hill ! They should aspire to be like us , not the other way around . That 's right . And so I make this pledge to you . Tonight ... once and for all ... we pull back the curtain and reveal ourselves for who we are . After tonight , we will be ... respected . Come on ! Don 't . Think about what you 're doing . Don 't do this ! Don 't ! You okay ? Sit . Just dislocated . Awesome . What the hell is he doing here ? There you are . Time for your solo . How do you think all the people are gonna find us ? You 're gonna bring them here . I told you you had a unique gift . It 's time to put it to use . What dream ? Thousands of people will die . He was right about you . You disappoint me , Emma . You can 't force me to do anything . I would have preferred you were a willing participant , but these things happen . She 's all yours , Mr. Doyle . I 've always had a thing ... for blondes . Excuse me . Hiro Nakamura ? The woman in room 1106 asked me to give this to you . I trapped him in a nightmare . What 's he doing out ? You did this . It 's a long story . We need to know what Samuel is planning , when and where . Thousands of people are in danger . Get in his head . Tell us what you see . So you run off and be superheroes together ? This is ridiculous . Come on , he 's a monster . - You actually trust him ? - You want something done ? Samuel 's gonna show the world his powers ... New York City ... Central Park , tonight . " Show his power ? " Samuel 's gonna open up the ground , kill them all , bury them . Sounds like a plan I used to come up with . You say that like it wasn 't yesterday . I 'm not that person anymore . I know it 's hard to understand . - We got what we needed . Let 's go . - You won 't go anywhere . You leave with Sylar , people are gonna end up dead . That 'll be on you . I can 't let that happen . Let 's go . I won 't anywhere . - What are you talking about ? - That would be me . I can still push a thought . I told you , I 'm not letting him out of here . We 're too deep . We 're not . We can dig our way out . It might take a while , but ... We 'll run out of oxygen . The more we dig , the faster we 'll run out of air . Or more precisely , the faster I 'll run out of air . Your lungs will keep regenerating . What are you saying ? It 's futile . What do you mean " futile ? " We have to find some way out of here . I think I know why Samuel put you down here with me . So you could watch me die . Lure them in . Excuse me . My God . When I saw the nurse 's chart said " Hiro Nakamura , " I couldn 't believe it . It 's been an awful long time , Hiro , ever since the Burnt Toast Diner , 65 years ago . We have to focus . We have to think of something . You have a plan . I know you have a plan . - What is it ? - There is no plan . I need to talk about what you saw in the house of mirrors . - Why ? - Because you 're gonna survive this . If it takes a month , you will get out of here . I 'm not going to . - That 's not true . - Yes , it is . And there are things that I need to say . What you saw up there , all of it , it 's all true , but it 's not the whole truth . Don 't do this . We 're all products of our own experiences , good and bad . Everything that 's happened to me has made me who I am , - but it can 't explain what I 've become . - You 're my dad for better or for worse ! Don 't protect me , Claire ! That 's my job . To protect me ? From the rest of the world ? Yes , exactly . That 's why you believe people like me can 't live out in the open . It doesn 't matter what I believe anymore , because the whole world ... is about to find out about you . We can thank Samuel for that . Maybe it won 't be so bad . Maybe the world is more ready than you think it is . Things change . Sure . There might be curiosity for a while , but all it takes is one Sylar , and then the pitchforks come out , and all hell breaks loose . I 've seen it . They will turn on you . It 's human nature . You 're right . Things change ... but people don 't . Sylar killed your brother . He killed Nathan . - I 've repented . - Yeah , during the nightmare . That lasted a couple hours ? Not to us . That was five years . You heard what Samuel 's planning . We can stop him . I don 't expect you to understand what happened in that nightmare . - I don 't expect you to forgive me . - Good , that 'll never happen . I 've done so much wrong to many people . Just give me a chance to redeem myself . I was inside your head , I know what it takes to be good . Go inside mine . And you make the call . You see it . Right here . What I saw was inside your twisted mind . That wasn 't your heart . I can prove it . Just give me a chance . You need to trust us . Fine . Just get the hell out of my home . Let 's go . Now you are going to do exactly what I tell you to do . Emma 's doing an incredible job . It 's quite a crowd . They 've all come out to see us . See us do what ? Our acts ? What else would I be referring to ? Those news cameras ... - you invite them too ? - The world needs to meet us . It 's the biggest show we 've ever done . You seem nervous . Are you ? Excited . Tonight changes everything ... for all of us . He was there waiting as I left the Burnt Toast that day . Some old man said he was a friend of Samuel Sullivan , put his hand on my shoulder . Next thing I knew , I was on a street corner in Milwaukee . It was January 26 , 1944 . It was cold . I was scared . I didn 't know a soul , and I missed you . - And you lived all this time . - I got a job in a munitions factory . All the girls did back then . Did you realize it takes 108 pounds of rivets to hold the wing of a P-51 Mustang in place ? Unless , of course , you use the 14-gauge instead of the 16-gauge ... I 'm so sorry . This was all my fault . I led the Evil Butterfly Man to you . It is because I loved you that he sent you away . When I said I was the product of my experiences , I left out the most important part . You . You came into my life , and you changed everything . The man you saw in those memories could never have died a happy man . But I can , because of you . Don 't say that . Try to find a way to forgive me . I don 't need to forgive you . I need to thank you . I am who I am because of you . I love you . I love you too , Claire bear . So I want you to promise me something ... that you 'll hide . What ? The world doesn 't have to know about you . You can stay in . You can blend in . You can pass . You know how to do it . We don 't have to do this . We can find a way out . I want you to promise me you 'll stay hidden . Claire , please . It 's my dying wish . Please , promise me . Dad ? Dad ! - I don 't know what to do . He 's dying . - Not if I can help it . Dad . Dad . We have to get you through 30 feet of dirt . Ready ? Come on . - You 're gonna owe me one . - He will as soon as we get out of here . I hope you can swim . Dad . You okay ? - Tracy saved us . - I know . I called her . - Carnival 's gone ? - They 're in New York , Central Park . I lined up a chopper to take us into Manhattan . It 'll be here any ... second . - Where is she ? - She said you owe her one . We 've got to go . Don 't beat yourself up . I would have waited for you , but by the time you were born , I was middle-aged . I 'm just so happy I got to see you before ... You 're not well . The good news is ... that brain aneurysm never bothered me again after your weird doctor friend cured me . Unfortunately , pretty much everything else is about to give out . I can fix this . Fix this ? How do you mean ? I can fix everything . I 'm sorry . Will you excuse us for one minute ? He 's done it . He 's brought in thousands of people . This is gonna be a massacre . We got to find the backstage area . You know where it is ? - It 's back that way . - All right , let 's split up . You go that way , and I 'll head off this way . Be careful . You too . This way . Wait ... - The dream . - What ? All these people , they 're all here , like lambs to the slaughter . It 's not gonna happen . Go find Samuel . I 'll save them . Your dream said I save her . Trust me . It 's an emergency . Tell Hiro he needs to get here as fast as he can . Where do you think you 're going ? Don 't worry . I 've come to save you . What brings you to the Big Apple ? Everybody . Everybody listen to me , please . We need to get you far away from Samuel . You don 't belong here . I know what he told you about tonight , that you 're coming out and that you 'll live out in the open . And trust me , there is nobody who wants that more than me . But this is not your coming-out party . This is his . Look who finally came up for air . What are you doing here ? - You 're not part of this family . - You 're right . I 'm not . But let me ask . Does your family know what you 're planning to do ? Why don 't you tell them ? He 's gonna kill all of those people out there . That 's how he 's gonna introduce you to the world . Why would he do that ? He 's given us all new life . If he hadn 't found me , I 'd still be living out in that park . Homeless . They know the truth . Tonight is our night . I never wanted to hurt your family . Ask yourself if that 's true of Samuel . He killed his own brother . I 'm only here to stop him from murdering a lot of other people . Then you and I have the same goal . I can 't kill him in front of the others . And you strike me as the kind of man with a plan . So what do we do ? It 's simple . I 'll be waiting for you in 1944 . When you pop in on that snowy street corner , I 'll take you back to Burnt Toast Diner , right where I left you . And I 'd be young again . And we can finally build a life together . That sounds nice . But , Hiro , I already had a life . I had a wonderful life . 65 years is a long time . Grandma ! Hey , there , honeysuckle . - Where 's Mommy and Daddy ? - They 're talking to the nurse . Sally . This is an old friend of mine . - His name is Hiro . - That 's a funny name . Hello , Sally . Go find Mommy and Daddy so they can meet Hiro , okay ? After the war , I married a wonderful man . We had four children . I now have seven beautiful grandchildren . We had a home , friends , cherished memories ... A life . If I were to go back now and lead a different life , what would happen with all that ? What would happen to Sally ? I don 't want to hurt you . Just let her go , please . Since when do you ask politely ? A lot of people are gonna die . Are you a shape-shifter ? Is that Dudley Do-Right in there ? You can 't hold us here forever . I don 't plan on it ... Just long enough for Samuel to finish the show . Isn 't that right , Em ? I don 't think she heard me . Are you okay ? Please . Listen to me . - Please , Samuel made me do it . - Really ? I thought you were the puppet master . Come on . What do you care about this girl , anyway ? I am here to save her . That 's not you . You 're like me . I 'm a hero . You think you 're here to save them , but they don 't need saving . They know what I 've done for them . Do they know that you gain your strength from them ? You are the source of his power . Without you , he is nothing . That 's why Joseph was keeping this family small for all those years , because he knew . He knew how powerful Samuel could be , that he would lose control , just like when he buried that town . But you all walk away now , and he will be weak . He will be ordinary . He will be nothing . I think we 've all heard enough , am I right ? He 's using you , and that 's what Joseph was trying to keep from happening . But why don 't you tell them what you did to stop him ? - That 's enough ! - He killed his own brother ! You think they 're gonna believe you over me ? They 'd be lost without me . There 's not one person here who thinks I 'm capable of murdering my own brother . There 's one , actually . Make that two . Lydia told me everything . She 's not here to confirm that now , is she ? - Because he killed her . - That 's a lie . Isn 't it ? Tell the truth . You had me kill Lydia . I did no such thing . You blamed it on me to justify what you 're going to do . What , you 're gonna believe him , after all I 've done for you ? I know I can 't stay in this family after killing one of our own . But he has to be stopped . It 's up to all of you . Claire 's right . You walk away , and he 's powerless . It 's over . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Wait ... Where are you going ? Don 't you see ? You 're victims . All of you , like Joseph . Run as fast as you can . You 'll never get far enough ! Ladies and gentlemen , do you want a show ? This is the greatest show on earth ! We 're too close . We need to get as far away as possible ! Go . You seem to have found my power . It 's funny how that works . I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone now . You of all people should know they have to fear us ! That 's the only way they 'll respect us . All you 've ever wanted is respect . We know what it 's like to live in the shadow of a brother . Joseph destroyed my potential , kept me down , Just like your brother . My brother didn 't let me down . He built me up . You need to teleport everyone out of here . - All of you ? - We need to try ... everyone . There are so many . - They all have to be touching . - You heard him , everybody join hands . I 'll stay ... take care of Samuel . One , two , three . So how does it feel to be ordinary ? Where did they all go ? They can 't have all left . They 're here somewhere ! You can 't leave me . You cowards ! Where are you ? Come back here ! You 're nothing without me ! I got to say ... I never liked carnivals . Are you okay ? There was a man named Doyle . He made me play . Your friend ... Took care of him . What do you think ? I like it . - Is everyone safe ? - Hiro 's taking care of them . They 'll be fine . Head down . Who 's taking Samuel ? Is it a new company ? An old one . Lauren called in some favors . What 's she telling them ? - There was a gas main rupture . - Of course there was . And all the other stuff , the flying , the rumbling ... All just special effects put on by a very gifted showman . You still can 't see it , can you ? - See what ? - The future . One where we all get to live out in the open . You know how I feel about this . How long can we keep this under wraps ? Excuse me . You were witnesses . What happened ? No comment . Can you tell us what you saw here tonight ? What he said . Miss , please , you have to have seen something . Are you sure , miss ? Look like you want to say something . Actually , I do have something to say . You 're right . People don 't change . You want to know what really happened here tonight ? Keep the cameras on me . Stay with her . Don 't lose her . You getting this ? What is she doing ? Breaking my heart . It 's amazing . - What is ? - When I saved her . I didn 't have a thought for myself . I could have killed Doyle , but I didn 't . It felt ... - good . It felt right . - What is she doing ? She 's gonna change everything . That 's right . It 's a brave new world . My name is Claire Bennet . This is attempt number ... I guess I kind of lost count .

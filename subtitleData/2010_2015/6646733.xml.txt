 Launch control , we are go for launch . Initiating launch . Ten , nine , eight , Seven , six , five ... - Ignition sequence started . - Four , three , Two , one . We have liftoff . Houston , all the readings are normal . Copy that . Over . Readings are showing fuel pressure 's dropping And becoming unstable . Abort ! Eject the payload ! Payload successfully ejected . Houston , the payload is coming over a populated area . [ Animals growl ] Roger that . What are the coordinates ? We 're sending over the recovery unit . [ Crocodile snarls ] [ Smoke hissing ] [ Dramatic orchestral music ] * * [ Classical music on radio ] [ Whistling ] [ Tiger growling ] Oh , hi , Caesar . * * I have some for you too . [ Tiger growling ] [ Whistling ] [ Tiger growling ] Okay , okay , calm down . I know you know what the radio means . Breakfast time . Did you sleep well ? Nightmares again , huh ? Yeah . * * [ Yawns ] What the ... What is that ? Stella . Stella ? Where are you ? Come and get it ! Where 's my girl ? [ Electronic buzzing ] [ Mechanical whirring ] [ Crocodile roars ] No ... [ Panting ] Whoa ! Whoa ! [ Grunts ] Jeez ! Aah ! [ Panting , struggling ] [ Growls ] [ Brakes squeak , engine stops ] [ Knob clicks ] Gah ! [ Sighs ] Thank God you 're here . Oh , that 's never a good sign . What happened this time ? We had an incident . What , did chef get stuck in the elephant butt again ? Hey , you know , my video of that Has over a million views on the web . That 's great , but no . Oh , a naked new-ager go swimming with the polar bears ? They think they 're all soft and cuddly , But they 're looking at us like we 're dinner . Sorry , no naked guy . Chimpanzee get fresh with the zebras ? Uh-uh . A homeless guy pass out in the meerkat cage ? - Nope . - That 's it . I 'm out of ideas . Something happened In the crocodile enclosure this morning . Is Stella okay ? Depends on what you mean by " okay . " Well , she 's alive , right ? She 's alive , but chef 's missing and so is Stella . Log says he went out to feed the crocs , never came back . So what are you saying here , huh ? I 'm saying you keep forgetting that Stella is an Australian saltwater crocodile , Not a shih tzu . I know exactly what she is because I happen to be The person who brought her here . Then you should know she has the potential to be a man-eater . And now she 's out of her cage and loose in the park . Oh , come on . Why on earth would she eat chef ? I don 't know . Maybe she doesn 't like his taste in footwear . Let 's start there , shall we ? [ Sighs ] You know chef as well as I do . He 's probably bathing with the sea turtles right now . Excuse me , Mr. Marshall ? Yes . I 'm Jane Spencer , your new biologist . Of course . Nice to meet you , Jane . We 're in a bit of a hurry . Join us , please . I didn 't know we needed a new biologist , but I approve . Jane was a fellow alumni at northern Cal . Thought it was about time I got some field experience . Figured this might be a good place to start . Field experience in a zoo ? That 's interesting . I know you . Oh , trust me , if we had met before , I would remember . Especially with those eyes . Jane , this is Jim Duffy , our suave zookeeper . Yeah , no , I recognize you . You were on that cheesy show . Oh ... [ Chuckles ] The one ... two neanderthals . Wrestling around in the mud In Africa with crocodiles or whatever . Well , if it was in Africa that 'd be a nile croc . We were in Australia with the salties . You know anything about crocodiles ? More than you think . Terrific , ' cause you are about to meet a big one . [ Geiger counter clicking ] What is all this ? That 's what I was trying to tell you . Jim , I 'd like to introduce you to Dr. Riley . - Hello . - And colonel Montgomery . This is Jim Duffy , our chief zookeeper , And Jane Spencer . She 's our new biologist . So what 's the story here ? We lost one of our aircraft , and we have reason to believe Some of the debris may have crashed here . In our zoo ? - Uh-huh . - It 's a recovery operation . That 's really all you need to know . Oh , well , it was really lovely chatting with you too . Oh , my apologies , Mr. Duffy . I 'm here to do a job , and that 's what I intend to do . And I 'm not trying to stop you , But this habitat is my responsibility And with your permission I 'd like to go down there and have a look . No , I 'm sorry . That 's not gonna happen . But we 'll call you if we need you . Okay , well , good luck with her , then . " Her " ? - Stella . - Stella ? Yeah , about 25 feet long , weighs in at 2,300-plus pounds . The croc . Yes , I think we can manage . You do realize her jaws have more crushing power Than a great white shark . Yeah , she may have already eaten one man today , But well , like you said , you can manage . Sir . Sir , we 're almost set up . Where should we start first ? - Northern squadron . - Yes , ma 'am . Mr. Duffy . Yep . Maybe we do have a job for you . [ Grunts ] All right . Okay . This is one of my favorite parts . Look at that baby . - Whoa . - [ Chuckles ] Whenever he 's ready . Let 's do this . Better not miss . He won 't . [ Beeping , whirring ] There she is . Where 'd she go ? She was right there . Wait for it . She 'll surface in three ... Two ... One . [ Fires ] Target is down . Target is down . We need to get her out of the water before she drowns . She is amazing . Yes , she is . Tranquilizer 's kicking in . [ Crocodile breathes ] She 's alive . Oh , yes , she is . She 's beautiful . Yup . We 've been through a lot together , me and her . Oh . Sorry about this , Stella . All right , fellas , you got one hour before she wakes up . Whatever you 're looking for , find it fast . I know you 're gonna wake up with a little bit of a hangover , But not as bad as I have today . [ Chuckles ] Now let 's go find chef , So I can have my morning coffee . Come on . [ Grunting ] Come on . [ Grunting ] Roger , Alpha one , we copy . Sir , we have confirmation that the target is sedated . Team is ready for phase two . Standing by . Recovery team , move in . I want every inch covered . You guys see anything ? Copy that . Clear on the left side . All clear over here . [ Geiger counter clicking ] There . You 're right on top of it . This way . Keep moving . - Check back over there . - Check under that brush . Roger , command , we found it . The payload appears to have deployed on impact . Waiting to be advised . Over . Something definitely went down here . See how the ground is all scarred up ? Means there was some kind of struggle . Maybe after the struggle she ate him . Oh , come on . Stella would not eat chef . Just help me find him . [ Groans ] Duffy . Look . It 's definitely his . You gotta admit this does not look good . Well , it 's just a shoe . Doesn 't mean that he 's dead . [ Sighs ] Then where 'd he go ? Follow me . Yup . [ Exhales ] There 's the pin . You think he went in here ? I 'm positive . There 's his other shoe . Chef ! What is that ? Why is she losing her hide ? You 're the biologist . You tell me . Whoa , it 's like it 's shimmering , like metal . Some kind of metallic substance adhered to it . I 've never seen anything like that . Something 's very wrong here . I 'm gonna have to run some tests . All right . I 'm gonna go in after him . We 'll figure out what that is later . She 's escaping ! Look out ! [ Growls ] - What 's she doing awake ? - Oh , my God . Whoa ! [ Roars ] [ Machinery whirs ] Look at the way she 's moving ! She 's defending her territory . No , no , no , no , that 's not territorial behavior . Then what is it ? I 've never seen anything like that before in my life . Not even in the wild . Oh , my ... [ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] Where are you ? Oh , my God . Come on . [ Sighs ] All right . All right . Calm down . They 're coming . They 're coming . It 's just a matter of time . Somebody 's gotta be looking for you by now . All right . Unless ... They think you 're already dead . [ Grate clangs ] [ Grunting ] How long can she stay under ? 10 , 15 minutes Max . And you 're sure there 's no other way out . Positive . I mean , there is a drain pipe , But there 's no way she can get through the metal grating . Why are you suddenly so interested In my croc now anyway ? Because , Mr. Duffy , if I 'm right , That 's not your crocodile . The hell 's that supposed to mean ? Duffy , take it easy . No , I want to know what she meant by that . Duffy . Wait . We still tracking that payload ? Yes , ma 'am . Excuse me , but what is ... What do you mean it 's not our croc ? Duffy ... Do you mind ? I 'm trying to ask Dr. Riley a question . And I 'm ignoring you . Where is it now ? According to this , it 's on the other side of that wall . What ? That 's impossible . There 's no way she could tunnel under her enclosure . Crocodiles do dig , but that 's a little extreme , Even for a croc Stella 's size . Exactly . What 's on the other side of that wall ? That 's the African lion habitat . Well , that should slow her down a bit . No . That 's not how it works . The saltwater crocodile is an apex predator . Meaning ? I wouldn 't bet on the lion . [ Dance music ] Whoo ! * it 's gonna change your life forever * - yeah ! - [ Laughs ] * * So your dad works here ? I thought he worked in insurance . That 's Stan my stepdad . My dad 's a zookeeper . * * Dude , this place is like paradise . * * Whoo ! * * - dude , stop drooling . - I 'm not drooling . Do me a favor and put the camera away And let 's just find someplace to sit , all right ? This is the spot . [ Both sigh ] I could get used to this . This is great . [ Sighs ] * * Jules ? I want to go get a drink . Hey , we want drinks . - What are you doing ? - Uh , nothing . Hey , you guys have a problem ? No , we 're okay . No problem . - They 've been filming us . - Wha ... - Come on . Come on , guys . - Oh , my God . - Are you kidding me ? - Give me my phone back . This is me . Well , I meant it as a compliment . Yeah . We 're done . - [ Whistles ] - Yeah ! - Dance with me . - You messed up . Whoa . No , no , no , no ! Please , no ! [ Crowd cheering ] No ! [ Both giggle ] Whoa ! What 's up , boys ? [ Both giggling ] Let me see those , Marshall . I think I found him . Oh , yeah . That 's chef . Where ? - He 's stuck in the drain pipe . - Is he okay ? It 's hard to tell . I 'll have to get down there And check it out before the lion does . I don 't think that 's a good idea . You got a better one ? Yeah , well , can 't we just put the lion back in its cage first ? Chef is the only one with the key . You 're the head zookeeper . You 're telling me you don 't have a spare set of keys . I do , but I left them at home On my counter with my multivitamin . It was a rough morning . Look , if he 's injured You might need a spare set of hands , so ... No , no , no , no , no . Forget it . No , absolutely not . What 's there to be afraid of ? Gee , I don 't know . The lion , for one thing . Wait , maybe this isn 't such a good idea . Trust me . When you get down there , Stay low and slow and no sudden moves . Anything else ? Hope berlusconi isn 't hungry . - Berlusconi ? - The lion . [ Scoffs ] Thanks . Don 't mention it . Come on . [ Inhales ] My father would have a heart attack If he knew I was doing this . - Why is that ? - He 's one of the trustees . When I told him I was coming to work here , I don 't think this is what he had in mind . Well , we 'll send him a postcard . He 's up there . - I know . Hang tight . [ Grunts ] - Are you okay ? My leg 's hurt , but I can walk . Come on . - [ Whispers ] Great to see you . - Good to see you too . Almost there . - [ Gasps ] - Stop . Don 't move . I know every instinct in your body Is telling you to run right now , but don 't . - Is it that obvious ? - Yes . [ Hisses ] Go ! Double time , double time ! Go on , chef . You 're first . Go , chef , go ! Brother . - Thanks a lot , man . - Of course . - I owe you one . - Yes , you do . - Be careful . - I will . [ Exhales ] - Hey . - Hey . You okay ? No . Yeah . You get used to it . They can 't help what they are . Mm . You can admit it . Admit what ? You 're impressed . With you ? No . Yes , you are . Here . Showing me your hairy calf is not gonna help your cause . That was a juvenile caiman . They are a smaller , less aggressive species , But it taught me never to underestimate them . And this ... Oh . What is that ? Ah , that was an 18-foot salty in Australia . My first encounter . Well , you 're lucky it wasn 't your last . Exactly . You know , you picked a very odd time to tell me That your father was a trustee here at the zoo . I know . I 'm ... It just kind of popped out . I don 't want you to think that he helped me get this job . Okay . I got one for you . What 's that little guy ? Bunsen burner . [ Laughs ] Hardcore . Oh , you know it . [ Beeping ] Payload is transmitting , but I can 't pinpoint a location . Where could she go ? Anywhere there 's water . Which means anywhere in the park . How ? The water . Uh-huh . And ? We filter and recycle all the water in our attractions . It 's part of a green initiative which actually Saves us about 100 million gallons of water a year . The bad thing in this situation is that all the lakes , pools , Ponds , lagoons ... They 're all connected underground . [ Reel whirs ] [ Reel clicking ] [ Reel whizzes , plops ] [ Reel whizzes ] * I 'll catch me a fish * [ Burps ] Ooh . [ Grunts ] Whoa ! - Dude , I see blood . - There 's blood in the water ! [ People screaming ] Let 's get out of here ! Here , come on . Come on ! Come on ! We gotta get out of here ! [ People screaming ] [ Dance music ] * * [ Grunts ] Why 'd you thank those douche nozzles For throwing us in the pool ? I thanked them for not kicking our asses . Yeah , whatevs . Really ? Let 's go have some fun . [ All cheering ] * * - hi . - Hello . Can we get , um , two vodka tonics and a ... I don 't know . Will you get me a beer , baby ? - Do you want something ? - Yeah , I 'd like a beer . And a beer . Me too . Hey , how 's it going ? Yeah , you like that ? Like that ? Hey . Hey , where you going ? Come on , get back here . - We 'll be right back . - Okay . We ... we are really , really , really sorry . It 's you again ? You don 't like my dancing ? You wanna go ? Let 's go . Right now . Whoa ! Hey . [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] Whoa ! Whoa , whoa ! Look , can we not just talk about this ? No ? [ Laughs ] [ Hitting door ] Hello ! Dude , give it a rest . We 're gonna have to wait in here Until someone has to drop their kids off at the pool . Is your phone working in here ? Mine 's at the bottom of the pool . Did you see that chick I was dancing with out there ? She was totally digging my moves . [ People chattering ] [ Giggling ] Copy that . Patch him through . [ Phone rings ] Marshall . Sir , our underground pipe sensors Detected movement in the water park . Got it . Wait a minute . I know that look . What 's going on now ? They found her . She 's in the cove . What ? Colonel , she 's in the water park . We have hundreds of people in there today . Well , we gotta get ' em out , and we gotta get ' em out now . It 's not that simple . [ People chattering ] [ Muffled dance music ] [ Laughs ] Whoo ! [ Chuckles ] Hey , drinks are ready ... What are you doing ? Whoa ! [ Screaming ] [ People screaming ] Uh ... [ Snorts ] Come on . Shut down the park and lock her in . That 's gonna take some time , colonel . So do it . Lock the gates and make sure she doesn 't get out of the park . Yes , sir . [ People screaming ] Wait for me ! Wait for me ! [ People screaming ] Oh , no . Oh , no . There 's gotta be , like , A lifeguard or somebody or something . What did this ? That 's it . I 'm done . I 'm out of here . Help ! Help ! It 's locked . We can 't climb it . There 's gotta be another way ... Out . Why don 't we just call someone ? Who has their phone ? - [ Panting ] - Sydney ? My battery died . Hello ! Is anyone there ? Hello ! Sydney ? Oh , my God . [ Sobbing ] This is great . How big is the lagoon ? - You mean the pond ? - Uh-huh . It 's approximately 3 1 / 2 million gallons . And another 500,000 if you include the pools . And they 're all connected . Yes , sir . Doctor , do you still have a signal ? It 's still in the park . So what 's the plan here , colonel ? The plan is to flush it out and then kill it . Oh , no , colonel , it isn 't . Yes , it is , doctor . Gentlemen , would you excuse us for a moment ? Of course . Get lost , Mr. Marshall . If the crocodile is hosting that payload , It 's imperative we take it alive . People are dead , including several of my men And God knows how many civilians . I 'm well aware of that , colonel , And I am truly sorry . But we are here to do a job . As far as your men are concerned , They knew the risks , and so did you . You know something ? If I didn 't know better , It sounds like you wanted this to happen . Oh , you are dangerously close To crossing a line here , colonel . Did I ask for a field test ? You bet . Was I denied ? Yes . Right now , I 'm here to do Exactly the same thing you 're here to do , And that 's to clean up this mess . Now , am I going to have a problem with you ? No . No problem . Good . [ Panting ] There 's something in the water ! [ Roars ] Whoa ! [ Screaming ] That 's it . I 'm over this b.S. I want some answers . I want ' em now . Well , I can understand that , Mr. Duffy , But this is a classified operation , And I 'm not authorized to give you any more details than that . Well , there 's probably an awful lot of people out there Who 'd like to get their eyes on this . I 'm sure they 'd be very eager to find out What exactly it is that 's capable of turning Organic material into metal . Something 's changing my Stella into a machine . Something that obviously you made . Hm . You know , threatening me isn 't gonna get you any answers . If you show this piece of illegally-obtained Government property to anyone , I personally guarantee that both of you will be Prosecuted under article 27b of the national security act . [ Sniffles ] [ Sobbing ] [ Whimpers ] [ Panting ] Here , baby . It 's gonna be okay . Guys , I think I know who can help us . Your dad works here , right ? Yeah , he 's a ... He 's a zookeeper . Something terrible has happened . We need your help . [ Exhales ] Damn . [ Beeping ] It 's a nanotech-based weapons system Designed to be deployed behind enemy lines . The nanobots are delivered to the target area . They locate a suitable host and begin replicating . They can absorb anything , become anything , They could change the face of modern warfare . This is our first working prototype . I can certainly see why you want them back . In a real-world battlefield situation , The bots would be programmed with objectives , Root-level directives , that kind of thing . The test at the proving ground was more basic . They were only given a root-level directive . Which was what , exactly ? Survive . Hm . We just got signal . She 's in the lake . [ On walkie-talkie ] Unit one , The GPS just picked up Stella at the lake . What is this thing ? She has metal coming through her skin . Fire at will . [ Gunshots on walkie-talkie ] She won 't go down ! [ Screams ] [ Sighs ] I don 't know , maybe it escaped from the zoo . What , a crocodile ? Would 've heard about that . It was a crocodile , and I know how this is gonna sound , But when it came out of the water It looked like it was made of metal . Wait , let me get this . A robot crocodile ? Like a transformer or something ? You can make fun all you want , I 'm just telling you what I saw . Robocroc . Just be glad we let you out of there . Be glad you 're still alive . Yeah , thanks for that . Yeah , if it weren 't for your boyfriends , We might be dead right now . Dude . Not cool . Sorry . Look , we know you 've got a phone . Can you just call your dad and get us out of here ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . Look , colonel , if Stella has become Some kind of machine at this point , Isn 't there a way to just shut her down ? No , there isn 't . Short of a nuclear weapon , Direct exposure to an electromagnetic pulse Or maybe an extremely powerful electrical field . Those nanobots are capable of surviving just about anything . [ Sighs ] It 's no good . It 's not working . Maybe all the water . We already said we were sorry about that . I didn 't mean that . Okay . As long as it 's contained , we have time to plan . I 've called in a chopper . It 'll be easier to search the entire park from the air . - You 're clear for takeoff . - Roger that . Over . This is a top-secret mission . No one else is involved , and you 've got to act quickly . [ Helicopter approaching ] What 's that ? Colonel , we are approaching the lake . Sounds like a helicopter . - Help ! Help us ! - Anybody see anything ? - Nothing . - Help us ! Where are you going ? It 's gone . Maybe we should wait . Maybe it will come back . Or maybe it won 't . I don 't wanna die in here . I wanna go home . Look , it 's gonna be all right . We 're gonna get you out of here , okay ? Okay . Colonel , we 're coming over the lake . Find her quickly , neutralize her , and bring her back . There 's something in the water . We 're dropping down to take a closer look . False alarm . Nothing . We 're pulling back up . No ! We lost the chopper . That thing 's still out there and it 's out of control . I 'm sorry , colonel , my orders still stand . I 'm a soldier . There 's nothing on this earth that I don 't know how to kill . But taking something like that alive , It 's a different story . I can take it alive . All right , Mr. Duffy , I 'll give you your chance . What do you need ? To make a phone call . He looks really familiar . You remember your two neanderthals Wrestling in the mud ? He 's the other neanderthal . Why is he looking at you like that ? Nothing to worry about , Marshall . Who 's worried ? Eh ... You 've got some nerve calling me . Look , Nigel . I 'm sorry about what happened between me and your girlfriend . His girlfriend ? My " girlfriend . " She was my sister . Well , it 's the same difference in Ireland , right ? Come on . [ Both laugh ] - Good to see you , nige . - You too , duffers . Lucky for you I was still in the neighborhood . Supposed to be flying to dublin tonight . I 'm glad you could make it . It 's Stella . She escaped . Yeah ? How bad is it ? - Marshall . - Bad as it gets . Well , let 's get to work . Well , There 's plenty of places for a croc to hide down there . Don 't worry , duffers . We 'll find her . Okay , listen up , people . Those guns fire a high-powered chemical tranquilizer . Not strong enough to kill her . But definitely powerful enough to take the fight out of her . There 's only one thing we know for sure . She 's down there somewhere . Let 's go find her . Sounds like a plan . Ladies first . Oh , I was talking to Nigel . [ Dramatic music ] * * [ Beeps ] You guys seeing this up there ? Copy that , Duffy , we 're reading you . Jane , We 're splitting up to check the recirculation pipes . Over . Okay , Duffy . Good luck . Hey , Thompson , Me and you head this way . Nigel , you and Jackson take the two north ones . We 'll cover the South . Let 's go . [ Beeping ] Here , Stella , Stella , Stella . Where are you ? Where is she ? If she 's down there we 'll find her . I 'm at the first pipe , duffers . Visibility 's about three meters . There 's no sign of her . Roger , Nigel . I 'm approaching pipe two . The bars look like they 've been bent outward . I think she entered the lagoon from here . Thompson and I are gonna check the next pipe . Roger , duffers . I 'm going into the pipe a little further . It looks like there 's something up ahead . Roger that . We 're heading out . False alarm , mates . It isn 't her . Just an old tree . Copy , Nigel . Keep looking . We 're heading out of the pipes . There she is . Heads up , Duffy . She 's heading your way . Roger that . [ Machinery whirring ] No ! No ! Aah ! Oh , no ! She got Thompson ! Nigel , she got Thompson ! Get out of there ! Roger that . Get to the pond . I 'll meet you there . [ Coughs ] Okay , that 's enough . Now we 're doing this my way . Colonel , can I have a word ? I thought I made this perfectly clear That the crocodile was to remain alive . We 're past that . Don 't panic , doctor , I 'm sure your career will survive . [ Scoffs ] Which is more than I can say for yours If you force me to take this to Washington . Yeah ? Well , I 'm willing to take that chance . This ends now . Move ' em out ! [ Dramatic music ] * * What are they doing ? Electrifying the lagoon . - Electrifying the lagoon ? - Uh-huh . Lieutenant , let 's move it . Montgomery . On my way . Nice as a badger . Come on . You sure this is the way out ? We 're ready , sir . Okay , fire it up . Okay , let 's do this . [ Beeping , whirring ] [ Whirring increases ] [ Electricity buzzes ] Payload 's offline . Okay , it 's over . That 's enough for me . Shut it down . Hope you 're proud of yourself , colonel . Pack it up , gentlemen . We 're done here . [ Whirring stops ] [ Electrical buzzing stops ] [ Exhales ] I 'm sorry , Duffy . I didn 't want it to end this way either . I know how much she meant to you , mate . See you back there . So now it 's my turn . You okay ? Well , it 's all over now . That 's all that really matters . If it helps , do you remember when I told you That I didn 't want you to think I had my dad Pull any strings to get me this job ? Yeah . I lied . I did have him pull strings . Why ? Because I wanted to work with you . I thought I was a neanderthal . And you were right about something else too . Oh . Well , what now ? After the whole bit with the lion , I was rather impressed . Might 've even considered you attractive . Mm . I just said that out loud , didn 't I ? Can you try your phone again ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . Maybe it dried out by now . It works . I am so embarrassed . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have said anything . I 'll just leave you alone ... [ Cell phone rings ] And yeah . And your phone is ringing . Oh . My ... just ... Wait ... Duffy . Dad ? Dad , it 's me . It 's rob . Uh , rob , this is not a good time . I 'm just in the middle of something . Look , I don 't know how long my phone 's gonna last . We 're in the pool area . Everyone 's dead . What ? We need your help . There 's some kind of ... I don 't know , mutant crocodile . We killed her . It was Stella . Where are you ? Uh , we 're right next to the atv park . - Meet me at the main gate . - Yeah . Yeah , yeah , okay . And ? He 's coming to meet us . Follow me . [ Beeps ] [ Static buzzing ] [ Beeping ] Colonel Montgomery , it 's transmitting again . That 's not possible . [ Beeping ] [ Dialing phone ] Come on . [ Stella growls ] [ Screams ] You sure about this ? Yeah , he said to meet at the gate . And this is the fastest way ? From the pool to the park , yeah . Guys ! This is the fastest way . You look like a total dork . [ Screams ] - [ Screams ] - Get on the bike ! [ Starts engine ] Guys , she 's gone . Now where did he go ? They can run , they can swim , But there 's one thing they can 't do . - What 's that ? - Climb . We need to head back to the waterslide . It 's the highest point . Just go . [ Cell phone chimes ] Wait . It 's a text from my son . It 's alive ? [ Cell phone rings ] Evans . Nigel . Look , Robbie 's in trouble . He 's trapped at the pool area . Stella is still alive . Meet me outside . I 'll meet you there . [ Cell phone beeps ] Come on . - Colonel . - Uh-huh . There 's a chance maybe Stella 's still alive . Rob and a few of his mates are stuck in the water park . Duffy 's on his way there now . The operation 's been called , Mr. Evans . We 're not sparing any more men . [ Scoffs ] Congratulations , doctor . Looks like you 're gonna get your field test after all . Duffy , let 's go ! There ! [ All panting ] [ Panting ] And you 're sure it 's safe up here ? Yeah , I think so . I thought you said they couldn 't climb . Uh , they ... they can 't . [ Stella roars ] There she is . Look ! Dad ? I 'll distract Stella . You get the kids . Robbie ! Now ! Slide ! - Slide ! Go ! - Slide ! Nigel , no ! Stella ! Nigel ! Nigel ! What are you doing ? Get out ! Stella ! Aah ! No ! Nigel ! - [ Screams ] - Whoo ! [ Screaming ] Whoa ! Come on ! Go ! Come on ! Come on , guys ! Come on ! Wait , wait . - Robbie ! Are you okay ? - Yeah . I want you to get in the pump house right now . Lock the door . Don 't come out till I tell you . Go ! Okay , guys , come on . - Colonel . - Go ahead , Duffy . Stella killed Nigel and escaped the park . Okay . Lock down the perimeter now . Do you remember what your dad said ? The only other way is through the atv park . Hey , think . Just think . Look , it 's not like I come down here every day . I don 't know . Guys , check this out . She 's headed to old town . Colonel , you gotta let me help you stop her . No , thanks , Duffy . If I was you , I 'd take your boy , and I 'd get the hell Out of here . Listen to me . I can tell you where she 's going . I can help get your men close enough to finish her . Whatever that thing is out there , It 's still part crocodile . And I know crocs and their behavior better than anyone . Trust me . - I 'm listening . - All right . [ Dramatic music ] * * All right , colonel , you said there were only three ways To kill this thing . I 'm sure you 're not gonna nuke an entire U.S. city , And the electrical field didn 't work , So all that 's left is this electromagnetic pulse device . I believe I 'm the only person That can get us close enough to use it . The e.M.P. Has no heat , no blast . You don 't have to be a safe distance before it goes off .

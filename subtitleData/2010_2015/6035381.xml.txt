 Mariko . What 's wrong with you ? You haven 't answered my emails . I can 't tell you now . Yes , you can . Who is the caveman ? The man Grandfather wanted me to find . You can 't bring him in like that . I pledge to you ... Master Yashida ... to be vigilant ... and to dedicate my life ... to protect Mariko . This cowardly attack was ... the work of Yakuza thugs . A violent response to my efforts ... to crack down on organized crime . They exited the North Gate . She was with the stranger ... Our island is long and thin . Trains only run in two directions . I assure you Lord Shingen ... my officers are making every effort ... Then they 're idiots . You 've wasted enough of my time . I have my father 's affairs to attend to . Get out and find her ! If the Yakuza got into the funeral ... they had someone inside . They 'll never find me here . You 're not safe . I 'm coming down there . They 'll follow you . Please . Wait a few days . Please . I 'm fine . Logan 's here . He 's wounded , Mariko . Someone 's here . I have to go . A tree fell on the road . The men could use some help . Kuzuri . Did you know I studied biology in college ? Genetics . There are genes that skip generations . Recessive genes . Eyes . Eyes . Hair . Talent . Temperament . Not every child gets the same . My father saw little of himself in me . But in you ... he faced a mirror . How did you convince my father ... to award you control ... of Asia 's largest corporation ? You 've gone insane . I 'm just waking up . If you kill me , you will lose ... what little honor you have left . Fear not Mariko . I don 't want to hurt you . I want to help you . Help you end your pain ... what that mutant stopped you ... from doing last week . I never wanted to die , Father . It 's alright , Mariko . Come with me . What is happening ? ! More than you can imagine . Why have you brought me here ? What are you hiding ? You will soon find out . I know you care for him . You need to let go of that . You are a Yashida . She betrayed my grandfather ... and so have you . No Mariko . We grew up together . You need to trust me . Let me go to him ! He saved my life ! Let him go , Mariko ! This isn 't easy for me but ... I 'm following Grandfather 's wishes . The Viper woman is evil ... we both know that . But she 's a means to an end ... An end your grandfather wanted . You need to trust me . Is that hard ? We were meant to be together . We still can be . Perhaps . This is madness . I 'm sorry . You are a monster . You are my only family . Be well , sister .

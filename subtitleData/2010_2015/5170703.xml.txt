Tell commander Taylor we 're headed back now . So how much trouble do you think we 're in ? Well , you were recruited . I mean , they need you too much not to cut you some slack . Me ? You think they 'll make you serve out your time ? I hope not . I 'm not scheduled to be released for another 85 million years . Are those clouds ? Yeah , sweetie , they are . They 're so white . Hey , uh , Zoe ? I know I was gone a long time , but you remember me , right ? Allosaur tripped a sonic-mine . Just keep moving . Allosaur ... that the carnivorous kind ? Yep . We 're getting close . Hey , welcome to Terra Nova . Welcome ! Citizens of 2149 ... I 'm commander Nathaniel Taylor . But you probably already know that . Congratulations . Each one of you has taken a first step , just as I did seven years ago , toward a new beginning . Together , we are at the dawn of a new civilization . No pressure . The world you left behind fell victim to some of the baser instincts of our species : Greed , war , ignorance . We blew it . We destroyed our home . But we have been entrusted with a second chance . A chance to start over . A chance to get it right . Welcome to Terra Nova , folks . Welcome home . Taylor wants to see you . Without the children . Okay . We 'll be right back , sweetheart . We 'll be right back . Dr. Elisabeth Shannon . First in your class at Northwestern med . Doctor of science in immunology , bacteriology , and a couple other ologies I can 't even pronounce . Two years Pro Bono trauma work at I help the poor people general . - Commander Taylor ... - What I don 't get is it also says here that your husband is currently serving a six-year bit at Golad lock away . And yet , here he is . With a third child in tow . What am I to make of this ? Look , uh , this was all my idea , okay ? - Elisabeth didn 't even know . - Didn 't she ? A man doesn 't escape from Golad without help from the outside . Um , they weren 't going to let us bring Zoe . There was no other choice . Law caps families at two kids . You had a third , you got caught and you took the fall . The thing is this : I really don 't care about populations laws from another time . What I do care about is whether or not an individual is of use to this colony . A doctor we need . An escaped fugitive ... Not so much . Commander Taylor , all we 're looking for here is ... a fresh start . We just want to be a family again . Well , Dr. Shannon , we are pleased to have you here . Lieutenant Washington will show you your kits . I 'm going to have a private word with your husband . Now it also says here that you were a cop before you went away . Narcotics , Chicago P.D. I don 't understand . A man sworn to uphold the law , a woman as accomplished as your wife ... And you decide to have a third kid . To risk everything . Why ? It seemed like a good idea at the time . You thought that was a good idea ? That you 'd actually get away with it ? Good grief , son , what were you thinking ? What 's between me and my wife is none of your damn business . Now , are you going to lock me up or what ? What I ought to do is throw you outside the fence and let you fend for yourself . No , what you ought to do is give me a gun and a badge and let me do what I 'm good at . There must be some bad guys around here who need catching . Agricultural detail is down a man . That 's all . According to my daughter , I have whatever the opposite of a green thumb is . I 'll do my best . Agricultural duty . You can make that work , right ? Beats making license plates . Your quarters are here in the newer part of the settlement . There 's a px down that way for supplies . Some of these units aren 't quite finished . I don 't even think yours has been painted yet . Here we are . This is ours ? If you need anything , just let us know . This is it . Come on . I get the room with the most windows ! I get first pick . - Says who ? - I 'm the oldest . Man , they gave us the M-7 model . It 's not bad , right ? We can throw some paint on the walls . Get a rug or something . Do they have rugs here ? Maybe a nice sort of dino runner would be great down the hallway . I don 't know . Jim . We did the right thing , didn 't we ? Coming here ? Mommy , there 's no room for me . We 'll figure something out , sweetie . She doesn 't know me . Last time you saw her , she was barely three . So , we need to find a bed for ... Oh , what 's your name again ? Oh , that 's right , Martha . Okay , so we need ... Oh . Oh , right , right , right . Priscilla . Not Priscilla , huh ? Hmm ... Oh , wait , I got it . It 's Zoe . Yeah . Well , hi , Zoe . My name 's Alfredo . It 's a pleasure to meet you . I ... what ? No , it 's not . Well , what is it ? Daddy . Okay , so it 's settled . Me and Zoe get this room , seeing as it 's bigger . And we can squeeze another bed in . - Can I see ? - Yeah . One big , happy family . - Like nothing ever happened . - What 's that supposed to mean ? I guess we 're supposed to just forget about the last years we had to fend for ourselves 'cause dad was in jail . - Josh ! - That 's enough . - Admit it , mom , it 's his own damn fault . If he hadn 't lost his cool and thrown a punch at that cop he might have just gotten away with a fine . Have you ever thought about that ? Hey , we 're not gonna stand here and argue the past with you , okay ? We 're starting over . As a family . Zoe . - Has anybody seen Zoe ? - Where dis she go ? I thought she was with you . She was . Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe ! Good night , sweetheart . I 'm really glad you 're home , dad . Good night . Night . Yep . She got used to sleeping in my room . It seems we 've run out of beds . Luckily there 's a couch . Right . The answer is yes . We did do the right thing , coming here . You telling me this is all we can have for the next three days ? Did you not read any of the literature they gave us ? Real food has all these enzymes are bodies aren 't used to yet . - And besides it 's really not that bad . - I don 't want to go to orientation . I want to stay with you . Mommy has a brand-new job she has to go to . And Maddy and Josh are going to go to orientation so you can go with them , okay ? You guys used up - all the hot water . - Thanks . No , the solar panels can only heat up so much at a time . Blame it on the sun , if you want . The agricultural department , a quarter mile that way , dad . - And ... - Wait , that way ? - The clinic should be right here . - Are you sure ? All right , I better go . That 's ... okay . Have a good time . Okay , now , you ... no more wandering off , okay ? Okay . - So see you when you 're done . - Yeah . Have fun . Bye . Okay , so we should be meeting at the South End . Come on . No way . I can 't believe it ! Can 't believe what ? What is it ? You 've got to be joking . It 's the probe . You know , the one they sent through when they first discovered the time fracture . How can you not know that ? I was having a life , Maddy . No one knew at first how far back the fracture went or even where it led to . They sent this back with a beacon inside so that , you know , they could find it however many millions of years later . Only , they never did . Huh ? That 's how they knew that they were dealing with a new time stream . - Whatever , Maddy . - Whatever ? Okay , Josh , you do realize that if we were in the same time stream , then something like ... I don 't know ... Just stepping on a butterfly could change everything . Like , for example , us never being born . Can I scratch my name on it like everybody else 's ? Yeah , go ahead , Zoe . Mark it up . Okay , I 'm out of here . Where are you going ? To get some real food . I 'm starving . What about orientation ? I can explore on my own , Maddy . - Josh ! - Look after Zoe . Ugh . Let 's keep it simple . Why don 't you , uh , give us a hand with , uh , some weeding ? Weeding ? Yeah . Think I can handle that . Good . Yeah , this place needs a whole lot of upkeep . I 'll leave you to it . Okay . Aah ! I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Just a bug . No worries . I 'm okay . Just a ... just a bug . Yes ! Thanks . Oh , this is funny to you ? That 's how you get off ... Making fun of the new guy trying to eat fruit ? Here . Give it to me . Go ahead . You get used to it . I promise . I 'll take your word for it . Hey , what 's your name ? Josh . I 'm Skye . Fifth pilgrimage . So you a recruit or lottery ? Uh , my mom was recruited , so we all had to come . Most people count themselves lucky . You left somebody behind , huh ? So what 's there to do around here anyway ? Well , depends on how close to the edge you like to walk . Okay , bed one 's sedated and his wound 's sutured . Nurse , a hand over here , please . If you get a sec , could you check bed three 's oxygen ? Okay . Hi . I 'm Dr. Shannon . Okay , so you came in complaining of nausea and a headache , right ? The other doctor said I was hyperoxic , whatever that means . It means you 're not used to so much fresh air . Can you unhook me , please ? They said it 'd only take a half hour , and it 's been at least that long already . I don 't see an iv anywhere . Whoa ! " Whoa " ? Is that ... Is that a technical term ? Sorry . Interesting . They must get rid of the excess oxygen from the blood . Can you just get it off me ? Yeah . Let me just ... Oh . Hang on . There we go . All better . - Josh . - Dad . You 're supposed to be at orientation . What are you doing ? Josh , this is not how you start your first day . Would you excuse my son , please ? There 's somewhere he needs to be . - Let 's go . - Come on . Hey , I told you ... You can 't just come back after all this time and start telling me what to do . Let 's go . So how bad are things in 2149 ? It 's funny ... when it 's the only thing you know , it all seems so normal , but coming here makes you realize how bad things have gotten . I don 't really remember much . I was just a kid when we left . Oh , this is my place here . Hey , guys . This is Josh . - He 's new . - Welcome to Terra Nova . I 'm Tasha . That 's Hunter . How you doing , fresh ? So far , so good . So this is all your guys ' place ? Yeah , us and one other ... Max . And your parents ? Mine live just up that way . Why ? It 's your own place . Aren 't you only , like , 16 ? So ? I mean , we work . We have jobs . Yeah , this is the frontier , son . You got to grow up quick . You got the whole Taylor welcome speech , didn 't you ? We 're the new dawn of civilization . How was the office , sweetheart ? Not bad . We finished another hydroturbine today . Who 's the fresh ? Name is Josh . Max . Glad to meet you . It 's so hot . Who 's up for a little OTG ? - Yes ! - On foot ? No way . Well , guess who started repair dock duty this week . Great . Okay . We 'll meet you guys in the usual spot in 20 ? Yeah . OTG on your first day . That 's got to be a record . To us . We actually made it . I had my doubts for a minute there . Mmm . Wow . So ... How is your day going ? Well , I practiced some Neo-medieval medicine , and I tended to a thief . - A thief ? - Mmm . That 's what they told me . Why ? Well , it 's just , why would anyone steal anything here ? Everyone 's pretty much provided for . Who knows ? - But guess what . - What ? It 's not your problem . You 're not a cop anymore . So what 's this about Josh skipping orientation ? I don 't know . He just blew it off . I mean , I ... I can 't say I 'm surprised . Oh , no , I can 't say I am , either . You know what ? We shouldn 't be too hard on him . He 's been through a lot . We all have . That doesn 't excuse him getting out of line with me . He really missed you ... You know that . Just give him some time , okay ? He 'll come around . I just worry about him . That 's all . He has this knack for finding trouble . - Where are we going ? - Stay close . Okay . You ... you don 't have to come if you don 't want to . Out there ? You 're kidding , right ? Only way to find out is to come with . There . No big deal . You coming or not ? Skye . Damn . Come on . We were about to leave without you . Ah , hell you were , Hunter . Get ready to go OTG , fresh . OTG ? Outside the gates . Who 's up for the shortcut ? No way , Skye . We 'll meet you there . Keep up . I 'm trying . Just a howler . Sound a lot worse than they actually are . What , are you just going to stand there and watch ? Whoa ... ! Whoo ! You think that was fun ? You want to see something really cool ? - Cooler than that ? Sure ? - All right . Come on . This way . Check it out . Found it when we were exploring . There 's more over there . What is it ? Looks like some kind of geometry or something . I think they 're equations , but I can 't be sure . I-I can 't make heads or tails of it . Who did this ? I don 't know . Why do it on a bunch of rocks ? Doesn 't make any sense . It looks like it 's been here for awhile . You tell Taylor about this place ? No . We 're not even supposed to be out here . This whole area 's off-limits . It 's like Taylor doesn 't want anyone to know about this . Um ... Don 't tell anybody about this , all right ? You promise ? Good . What was he stealing that made it necessary to shoot him ? Him and his buddies were siphoning off our power grid . - Why would they need to do that ? - They 're Sixes . Sixes ? Slide your weapon across the floor . Now ! So , basically , calysonias is real finicky , so you gotta keep the nitrogen level just so , otherwise the roots get hydroxic . Hydroxic ? - Right . - Right . So what you need to do is you need to stick this into the root of the plant , and then you need to record it on here . Okay . Are you listening ? And like I was saying , once you , uh , get it on there , into the plant , and then you record it here . Yeah , you know , I 'm gonna be , I 'm gonna be right back , and we 're gonna do more stuff with the , with the thing ... - Right . - Hydroxic . Hydroxic . And Hope Plaza says they want to put through more than a hundred people next time . That 's a lot of housing units , not a lot of time . Suspend work on the South beach , we 'll focus on the Western project . Get down , Taylor ! Down ! Throw him in the brig . I 'll deal with him later . You want to tell me who that was and what the hell 's going on here ? Come on , let 's take a drive . There 's a lot about this place you need to know . School was nice , didn 't you think ? You know , playground where you don 't have to wear a rebreather . - I want to see the dinosaurs again . - Zoe ? You do , huh ? It 's probably not a good idea , though , 'cause if they get too full , then they get really sleepy and it 's really noisy when dinosaurs snore . Well , actually , brachisauri aren 't actually true herbivores . They , they sometimes supplement their diets with smaller reptiles , which is why they have proto-lateral incisors . Upper and lower . Okay . All right , I 'll see you guys later . Yeah . Kill me now . You can 't build civilization in a day , Shannon . Bound to be a few setbacks . We 've had our share . Yeah ? Like what ? That fella who tried to put a bullet in me ? He 's part of another settlement that split away from Terra Nova . Around here , people call ' em " sixers . " They call them that ' cause they all came through on the sixth pilgrimage . At first , they seemed just like the rest of us . But pretty soon , we began noticing some things , like how curious they were about camp security procedures . By the time we found the cache of contraband weapons , it was clear ... They had an agenda . What agenda ? Who sent them ? Believe me , many nights , I 've asked myself the same thing . Long story short ... they caught on that we caught on to them , then they high-tailed it like thieves in the night . Pilfered a significant amount of equipment ... And weapons . Well , maybe they gamed the lottery somehow . The thought has occurred to me . What did Hope Plaza have to say about all this ? What makes you think I asked them ? Until we know who sent those people back , and why , I just don 't know who in the future I can trust . This is what we 're fighting for , Jim , a new beginning for all of us . If today has shown me anything , it 's shown me that you 've got what it takes to be part of my security team here in Terra Nova . You asked me for a badge and a gun . They 're yours if you want ' em . Welcome aboard , Shannon . What is it ? Where ? Taylor to base . Got a pair of transports in-bound . And they 're coming in hot . - Who are they ? - Sixers . Things are about to get ugly . Taylor to base . You got a visual on those sixers ? We seen ' em , but we got a work crew outside the gates . We need time to get them inside . I 'll try and slow ' em down , but get everybody inside as soon as you can . Over there ! Two o 'clock ! Whoa ! Look out ! What are they firing at ? 'Cause it 's not us . What the hell is that ? Carnotaurus . I hate carnotaurus . We 're all clear ! What 's going on back there ? Just keep driving ! Situation 's changed . We 've got carnos out here . Get everyone inside . We 'll deal with the sixers later . We 're almost there , but you gotta buy us more time . Hey ! Keep those people back ! We got sixers coming in ! - Take the wheel . - What ? ! Take the wheel ! Okay . Okay . Hey ! Hey ! Look at me , you ol ' bastard ! This way ! Mom ! What 's happening ? Come here ! Stay down ! Come on . Come on . What are you waiting for ? Sonics , go ! Back away ! Get back ! Hello , Taylor . What are you doing here , Mira ? This is no way to treat company . Have your men lower their weapons . You first . You 're outnumbered . Then what are you so afraid of ? Came here for a reason . You 've got one of my people . Carter got shot ... While he was trying to siphon power off our grid . We know he 's alive and in your brig . You know this how ? Maybe we still have a few friends here in Terra Nova . Well , maybe I 'll have a sit-down with Carter ... Have a little chat about your friends . We want Carter , you son of a bitch ! Put the weapon down now ! - Don 't even think about it ! - Back up ... right there ! Watch it , you ! Get back ! Don 't come any closer ! Enough ! Stand down ! A trade . What is that ? Meteoric iron . They control the quarry . I want Carter , medical supplies and ammo . You can have your man . You can have the meds . No ammo . No way . Can 't blame a girl for trying . Guzman , get Carter out of the brig . Have medical put together some supplies . You 're new . Welcome to paradise . Dad ! Are you guys okay ? Yeah . How 'd you get yourself caught up in the middle of all that ? Taylor asked me to join security . So you 're going to be a cop again ? Dr. Shannon . Uh , we could use a hand over in the infirmary . It 's all right . Go . I 'll take the girls back to the house . Come on . It 's okay . That wasn 't a very nice dinosaur . No , he wasn 't , was he ? Is he gonna come back ? Look , you don 't have to worry about him , okay ? You 're safe here . I want to go home . Oh , you want to go home , huh ? Uh-huh , I know what you mean . It 's all this sunshine , isn 't it ? It 's way too bright . And the , and the fresh air ? Ooh ! Boy , does that ever get on my nerves . What 's with all these flowers here ? I mean , there 's , there 's too much color . And they 're smelling up the place ! Daddy ! Come on . You are home , sweetie . We all are . I 'm telling you , Skye . We 're close , Max , trust me . I thought you said you came out here all the time . Yeah , well , it 's been over a week . - And the jungle grows fast . - Oh , yeah . Here . Here we go . How 'd we do ? Could 've used a couple more days , maybe , but ... It 's not bad . Hey . Have a taste . Oh ! Yeah , that is moonshine . Cretaceous-style . What 's it made from ? Uh ... we call ' em fruts . You know , as in part-fruit , part-nut . Looks like we need a ... A restock . Well , why don 't you guys go grab us some fresh ones ? - Then Josh and I 'll start cutting . - Let 's do that . Why give Mira the meds ? All we 're doing is making it more difficult to beat them . Look , Guz , we need the ore . You know that . Doc ! That 's enough iso-biotics . I don 't want us to run short . Look , I 'm sorry you got tangled up in that situation before . Security should 've been more careful with the prisoner . Wouldn 't be the first time a patient 's pulled a knife on me . Considering you put in time at a state hospital , I expect so . Dr. Shannon , I 'm curious . With your résumé , as accomplished as you are ... You could 've had it pretty good back there . I mean , money and connections , you can buy a pretty good life . Maybe even one of those houses in one of the domes . Still , you chose to come here . - Why ? - Well , yeah , believe me , I 've had plenty of colleagues who have gone down that route , eking what they can from a world that 's on its last breath . But I didn 't want that for my children . I mean , I know life here is gonna present a lot of challenges to say the least , but ... I think they deserve the chance to be part of something real ... Something new ... Something that has a future . I understand . I felt the same way about getting my own boy here . I didn 't know you had a son . Came in on the second pilgrimage . Worked right here in the science division . He went missing a few years back . I 'm so sorry . Ah , there 's always the hope . I haven 't given up on him . Dr. Shannon , it 's good to have you here . I think you 're gonna do just fine . Can I just ask you to please ... To be careful with my husband ? You asking him to be on your security team , that is between you and him . But , you know , I 'm the one who stays up late worrying . I 'll make sure he gets home to you . Ooh . What is this ? Oh , it 's the , uh , the Barb from a slasher tail . The males all have ' em . It 's sharp . Yeah . You should see their teeth . Don 't worry . They mostly hunt at night . Yeah . Mostly ? Oh , no , thanks . Hey , uh , I 'm sorry about what happened back there . That whole thing with my dad . You two don 't get along ? Ah , we 're just ... really different , that 's all . I mean , he can go from zero to infinity in no second flat . You saw how bent out of shape he got . " This is not how you start your first day , Josh . " " Oh , excuse me , miss , my son has somewhere to be . " He 's lecturing me about rules ? He broke every rule in the book just to get here . Right . No , he 's like the kind of guy who would show up in a new place , and he 's like , " oh , I 'm gonna ditch orientation and go for a swim with a bunch of people I barely know . " Right ? Yeah , you guys are pretty different . Pretty different . Yeah . You 're bleeding again . Let me see . Look , I know things haven 't gone exactly like we planned . It 's all about to change . Delta One , can you read me ? Delta One , can you read me ? Go ahead , Delta Two . We spotted a vacated TN transport . Looks ripe . Grab the power supplies and any ammo you find . But move fast ; They can 't be too far . This power cell is jammed . Hurry it up already . What 's with you ? Thought I heard something . You 're always hearing things . Got it . Let 's get out of here . What was that ? Probably just a howler . Yeah . A ... howler . You know , it 's getting late . We should go . You wanted to see me ? Shannon , come on in . We 've got a situation here . One of our rovers went missing . Surveillance picked this up . Couple of our kids sneaking outside the perimeter . Josh ! We 've been trying to reach the rover over the comm for the last half hour ... no response . Night is falling . If we don 't get to them pretty quick , something else might . Why in heaven 's name would he do something like that ? ! She must 've talked him into it , so I 'm going to go with the search party . She ? Who 's she ? That girl he met when he skipped orientation . I told him to go back , but he wouldn 't listen . Okay , I 'm going with you . Uh , no , you 're not ; It 's too dangerous . - Jim , our son is out there ! - Yeah . Let me handle it ! No , you " handling it " is why he 's out there in the first place . Elisabeth ! Stay here . Watch your sister . - Dad ! - It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . I promise . No , no , no , no . Damn it ! Wh-wh-what 's wrong ? It 's stripped . The power cells are gone . The transport 's dead . Okay , well , then we have to call somebody . We have to tell them that we 're out here . Did you hear what he said ? It 's dead . That means there is no radio . It 's too far to walk . We 'll never make it back before dark . Oh , God . What 's that ? That 's a Sixer vehicle . What 's a Sixer ? Wait , where are you going ? To get our stuff back . Skye , no ! I 'm not going over there . You can 't trust a Sixer . Whatever , Tash . I 'll handle them . Hello ? We 're not armed . We just want to talk . Hey , we 're stuck out here without those power cells . Skye . Look , blood . Yo , guys , I got them . The cells are all here . Slasher , run ! Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Go , go , go ! What is it ? ! Slasher ! Just run ! Get away from me ! Come on , man , let us in , please . Hey , uh , I remember you . Drake , right ? It 's me , Skye . Skye . All right . Get in . Come on , go . Get in , get in . Let 's go . Get in ! Come on , go ! Hurry ! Max , get this thing started ! Yeah , well , it 's got an Alpha-num key-punch . So unless I know the code , then ... Okay , pop the panel , Jack the starter . I can 't . The rig is booby-trapped . Hey , Drake . Hey , how do you get this thing started ? It 's dead . Power converter got crushed by a slasher tail . Oh , my God ! He 's really bleeding a lot . Hey , your mom 's a doctor , right ? Found weapons ! Tie this around his leg above the wound tight as you can . You make it through this , you won 't be a fresh anymore . Oh , my God ! Last known location is the outer marker , two klicks down the southeast road . We 're gonna head in that direction , start scanning for a heat signature . Hunter Boyce is missing . Max Pope , too . - And another one . - Who ? My daughter . Tasha . Weapons and ammo in the vehicle . - You 'll need a medic . - No . Both parents , dangerous situation , bad idea . - Sorry , Jim . - No , I 'm going . No time for squabbles . Both of you ride with me ! Move out , people ! Most people know I was the first man through the portal . What people don 't know is that the men who came through behind me , well , they didn 't show up on this end right away . For them , it was just the blink of an eye . For me , 118 days . Look , I know you 're scared for your boy . You have every reason to be . But point is , this jungle can be survived . Why does it keep making that sound ? ! Oh , God , there 's another one ! Slashers hunt in packs . They corner their prey and signal the others . Before long , there 'll be dozens . We 're stuck in here ! We 're trapped , okay ? ! What about the radio ? Can we get it to work without the converter ? The comm won 't work . But Alvarez might have a portable one in his pack . - On the floor . - Hunter , get it out . It 's in that bag . Got it . Anybody can hear this ? Come in . Terra nova , come in . We 're going in circles . No , we 're establishing a search grid . Well , what if they 're outside the grid ? Then we expand it . Can anybody hear this ? We need help . Come in . Terra Nova . Copy that . This is Tango November one . Identify yourself . Commander Taylor ! This is Hunter Boyce . We-we 're stuck in a rover outside the perimeter . Uh ... Is your rover operational , Hunter ? Sixers jacked our power cells . Hunter , do you copy ? Slashers . Say that again . And say again about slashers . Conserve your ammo . Short bursts . Got it . Hunter , say again about slashers . Uh , three , maybe more . I can 't see any ... - About 80 meters down from ... - 80 meters ? I said we 're about 80 meters east ... East of what ? - Where is it ? ! - Grab it ! Josh , grab the radio ! Grab it ! Hello ! If you 're still there , we 're , uh , we 're about 80 kilometers east ... That 's Josh . Josh ? Josh , it 's your dad . Could not copy last transmission . Please repeat . Mom ! Dad ! Is that you ? Do you copy , Josh ? Please repeat . Josh ! Out of the way . My side 's clear . Mine , too . You think they left ? Don 't assume anything with slashers . Our gunfire drove them away for now , but they 'll regroup and come back . No , we should ... we should make a run for it while we still can . Make a run for what ? - Terra Nova ! - That 's , like , five klicks away . - Tash , we 'd never make it . - We have weapons , and anything is better than being sitting ducks ... No , we don 't know how many of them are out there , and we have limited ammunition . Hey , hey , hey , I might be a fresh , but , I mean , commander Taylor got our distress call . Commander Taylor knows we 're in trouble . We just got to hold on a little while longer for him to get here . It could take them hours to find us ! Well , we have enough ammo to hold off the slashers a little while longer . We can make it . My God , he doesn 't even know what he 's talking about ! - Tasha , Tasha ... - They can smell his blood ! They can smell his blood ! - They 're gonna come ... - Calm down ! We 're not gonna make it ! Whoa , whoa ! Tasha ! Tasha ! Tasha , no ! Tasha ! Tasha ! Stop it ! No ! Tasha ! It 's suicide ! - Hi . - Hey . What are you doing here ? Well , with everything going on , I wanted to make sure you were okay . Yeah . You know , we 're okay . Considering . Uh , we haven 't heard back from the search team yet , but , uh , shouldn 't be long though . I 'm sure your brother 's gonna be okay . - Um , if you need anything , just ... - Don 't go . Uh , Zoe 's scared . Right , Zoe ? This is Tango November . I have all frequencies open . Hunter , do you copy ? Josh Shannon , do you copy ? This is commander Taylor . Just keep heading east . I think that 's where the signal originated . With all this technology , shouldn 't they know ? Elisabeth . Anywhere else , we would know , but this is some dense jungle out ... Watch out ! Oh , God . What 's her name ? It 's Tasha . Okay , Tasha , can you hear me ? I 'm a doctor , okay ? I 'm right here . It 's me , daddy . I 'm right here , honey . I need you to apply pressure to this wound . Here , here , here . Tasha , you stay with me , okay ? Slashers came . Fired the gun ... Can you tell me where the others are ? No . We 'll get her safely to the hospital as soon as I stabilize her . Tasha , did you have to go through water to get here ? I-I ... There 's a stream about a half a klick north of here . Bracco , you stay here with Guz and the doc . Yes , sir . Rest of you , gather up . Put your hand there . Just in case . Jim , wait , wait . Look , I-I 'm sorry about what I said before . This is not your fault . Yes , it is . Josh came out here with these kids just to spite me . Spite you ? No , he is you . Pretty girl and a chance to break the rules ... You 'd have done the same thing at his age . Well , you should know . You were that girl . Bring him back . I will . Max , say we make a run for our rover . Are those power cells usable ? This one 's completely drained . The other two are half charged . If Hunter and I cover you , how fast do you think you can get those power cells installed ? Maybe five , ten minutes . I say we make a run for our rover , power it up and get the hell out of here . Hunter , check the cylinders on our weapons . We can do this , you guys . Come on . Are you hurt ? I 'm fine . You 're pretty good at this whole taking charge thing . Yeah , well , my dad was a corporal under commander Taylor . I guess he kind of rubbed off on me . Was ? Sincyllic fever . Mom , too . Sorry . Whatever . Everybody loses their parents sooner or later . What 's not supposed to happen is the other way around . Let 's try to get the hell out of here in one piece , all right ? If we do engage slashers , aim for the underbelly . Hides are too thick for the tranq-guns to penetrate . Stay five meters clear of their tails . Tango November , this is Guzman . Do you copy ? Yeah , I 'm here . We 're taking Tasha back to camp . Doc says she needs surgery . Understood . Hey , Guz , she 's in good hands . Keep sharp eyes . Mira 's your area . We picked up sixers ' radio chatter . Damnation ! Copy that . Mira ... just what I need right now . Her people always this much trouble ? Yeah , so far . I don 't know who sent them , I don 't know why , but I 'll tell you this ... I 'm not going to let them , I 'm not going to let anybody stand in the way of what we are building here . Terra Nova will succeed . How 's it looking , Josh ? Looks like we 've got a clear run to the vehicle . Okay , I think we 're clear on this side . This side , too . Okay . All right , remember to stay together . We all set ? Look , maybe this isn 't such a good idea . Maybe we ... should just stay here and wait for help . We talked about this . We can 't stay here . Just take it easy , man . Look , if a slasher 's going to munch on any of us , it won 't be your scrawny ass . No ! Hunter ! Hunter ? ! Hunter ! Hunter , are you okay ? Give me a hand . - We 've got to get into the rover . - What about Hunter ? I 'll stay and cover him . You guys just get those power cells in and get the thing moving . I 'm out ! Come on . Flank and tranq . Establish a perimeter . Keep coming , Skye . Got you covered . Josh ! Dad ! Josh . Get down ! It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's me . It 's over . Get him in the transport . Max , Max ! Oh , God . You 're going to be okay . You all right , young lady ? Tasha ... she-she tried to make it back to camp . Uh , huh , we got her . You said there were sixers ? Yeah , over there . With me . You 're safe . He 's gone . Mira . She came for her man . Looks like they 're back . Let 's get you looked at . Try not to put too much weight on it . I guess we know why they call them slashers , huh ? I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I want to say how sorry I am for what happened today . I know . You know , you 've been so good to me since my folks ... I just don 't like to disappoint you . Well , you 're still in one piece , that 's the important thing , huh ? Now you know why that area 's off limits . Sir . Well , it 's slasher territory . Yeah , of course . So just what were you all doing out there , anyhow ? Dumb stuff . Drinking . You didn 't go anywhere near the falls , did you ? No , sir . Good . Good . Those can be some treacherous waters . Someone was definitely here . Found footprints . It was those kids . Taylor 's not going to like that . He wants to keep all this under wraps . Why doesn 't he just blast them off the rocks ? 'Cause they 're the only connection he has left to his son . I still don 't get why the crazy bastard does this out here . Why do you think ? To throw it in his old man 's face . Every time he gets closer to an answer , he puts it here for Taylor to see . To remind him ... the real reason for Terra Nova 's existence . Control the past , control the future . These are the key ... To everything . Is it going to fall on us ? Is what going to fall on us , sweetie ? What is it ? That , my little Zoe , is the moon . And no , it 's not going to fall on us . Wow . Almost forgot what it looks like . I was a kid when the air got so bad you couldn 't see it anymore . Was it always so big ? Not always . It moves about half a centimeter away from the Earth every year . So it 's much closer than it was yesterday . You mean tomorrow . You know what I mean . The sky is insane . This whole place is . The stars are all different here , too . They 're not in the same place as in 2149 , because the universe has had 85 million fewer years to expand . I mean , do the math . We 'll just leave the math up to you , sweetie . Sync for WEB-DL by corleone

 Atticus : At long last i finally have the source of ultimate power and evil in my hands . I 'm going to spread your pages . I 'm gonna penetrate your deep dark secrets . And shudder with ecstacy as I bring my wildest desires to fruition . So - anybody know how we do that ? Only the former hooded leader , your dead father , knew how to harness the book 's power . And he took that secret with him to his grave . Maybe you shouldn 't have killed him . " Maybe I shouldn 't have killed him . " Do you want to be next ? Minion Bob ? I can 't believe he makes us wear name tags . Atticus : Okay ! I have a special surprise for all of you . One of you - is going to open the book for me . You - open the book . But - anyone using the book will ultimately be destroyed by its power ! Well that 's a sacrifeice , I 'm willing to make . With you . I order you to open the book . Minion : You cannot ! I 'm the hooded leader so you do as I say . Well , as Minion number one , I can sub-order your order to someone else . Minion Dave ! Open the book ! All right , I 'll do it , but this secret society has gone to shit . All we do is stand around in the dark talking about the prophecy . Yeah , whatever happened to all the booze , the drugs - the sexy girls - You 're like a bunch of old farts , flapping your wrinkly lips . For just one good meal - silence ! Minion Dave ! Open the book ! ( Sigh ) ( Over P.A. ) Would the hooded leader please come to the activities room . An altercation is in progress . That 's it - no more knitting circles okay ? Everybody follow me , Minion Bob ! Guard the book . ( Chains rattling ) Just one good meal ... Okay - everybody focus . When 's the last time we saw Jenny ? Yesterday . She was heading to the retirement home to search for her dad . To the retirement home ! But that 's Satan central ! And atticus might be there as well . Uh ! I hate that guy ! Especially after he hypnotized me into trying to kill you . We have to assume that the satanists have kidnapped Jenny . This just became a rescue mission . We rescue Jenny , get the book from atticus - and stop you from destroying the world ? We 're not 100 % sure Todd 's gonna do that . Yeah . Thanks dude . Now - let 's load up . On drugs ! Curtis , we discussed this . Curtis : Right , sorry . I mean , load up on love . Dude , what the hell ? Hannah thinks I smoke too much pot , so I 'm gonna cut down . Dude , you 've been dating for like a day and you 're already totally whipped . Don 't listen to him . But he 's my best friend . And I 'm your girlfriend . Man , relationships are tough . Those knitting needles are sharp . Solitary confinement should cool down Mildred and Betty for a while . They 're not so bad . Look what they made me . They even got my size right . Fuck me with a scepter ! Five minutes ! I was literally gone five minutes ! I 'd say more like seven - ooh , lunch time . Come on , fellas , let 's get a good spot in line . Where do you think you old farts are going ? Help me find the book . What the hell is she doing here ? We caught her trying to rescue her dad . ( Jenny mumbling ) Well didn 't work out so well , did it ? ( Jenny mumbling ) That 's sweet . I 've missed you too , pumpkin . Oh , I 'm gonna have to double diaper . ( Laughing ) Todd : Uh - ( clearing throat ) Hey kids , what can I do you for ? Curtis and Hannah need weapons , Jimmy . You kids ever heard of knocking ? Oh sorry Ms. dempsey . Sorry 's not gonna take this princess to the enchanted kingdom . So what are you guys fighting today ? Vampires ? Zombies ? Zompires ? Senior citizens . Those are the worst kind of monsters . You know what ? Help yourself . I got some goodies in there . Can you hand me that buddy ? I 'm really sorry , princess . I 'm gonna have to drill you a new shaft another time . You know , I don 't like it either . Another time girl ! Sorry . What are you looking at ? ! Get back to class ! Rough couple of days , huh ? Yeah , things could be better . Or things could be a whole lot worse . Yeah , I guess so . Look , dude , shit happens . Doesn 't mean it has to stink up the whole rest of your life . You know what I 'm talking about right ? Jimmy , I never know what you 're talking about . Alright listen , just stay away from those assholes in the parking lot . Yeah , tell me about it . I mean it . Hannah : We 're ready . Let 's move out . Brody : Little dude ! Where you off to in such a hurry ? Don 't say anything , just keep walking . Whoa , ingratitude does not become you . Yeah , we taught you how to fight . And you couldn 't even kill your loser friend . Loser best friend , thank you very much . Just ignore them . Those dudes are assholes . And together they make one giant asshole . You can 't ignore us forever , little dude ! This loser 's becoming a major pain in the ass . Looks like we need to come up with another plan . Already on it . ( Laughing ) That 's mine , you grey-haired crab-ladder ! Too late , you liver-spotted pansy ! We want more ! More food ! But ... There is no more . Liar ! Look he 's made of food ! Oh ! I knew this day would come . Ahhhh ! Ahhhh ! So - bet you 're sorry you kicked me out of your gang now . You lied to us , atticus ! And you kidnapped my father ! What did you expect us to do ? Well I have my own gang now . And they are badass . All : Hi . Ish ... Badass-ish . What is it now Minion - whatever your name is . The residents are rioting ! Ugh ! We want food ! We want food ! Didn 't they just eat ? Food ! Food ! More food ! You people are a ringing endorsement for euthanasia ! Seriously . We want food ! You ! Shut up ! How about I order some pizzas ? Food ! Food ! Food ! Run for your lives ! I think I know what happened to the book . I guess it 's nap time . Todd : I better be nice to my kids so I don 't end up in a place like this . Hey ! Watch it ! I don 't think that sword is such a good idea dude . Don 't listen to them , sanddragon . Ahh ! Gimme the food ! Gimme gimme gimme ! Dude on my back ! Dude on my back ! Dude on his back ! Dude on his back ! Oh my God ! Ahhhhh ! Ahhhhh ! Ahhh ! Food ! More food ! Gross ! Dude , cover your mouth ! We don 't have any food ! We want our friend Jenny ! She 's about ... ... This tall always scowling ... Uh ... Loose morals ... They 're wondering what 's for lunch ? I think it 's us . Food ! Where 's the food ? Hey , where 'd that hooded guy go ? Quick ! Use Jimmy 's weapons ! Why did you bring a boombox ? ( Heavy metal music ) Battle music ! Cursed noise ! It 's working ! It 's not working ! Next ! The water 's just making them angry - and wet ! Granny needs more brownies , Curtis ! Ahhhhh ! Granny , no ! We need a way out ! Take this ! Quick ! Follow Curtis ! Ahhh ! Todd : I can 't even see my hand in front of my face . Curtis : I can - because my hand lights up . This must be where they store all the medical supplies . Jackpot ! Sedatives ! I got - toilet paper . One ply ? It 's like sandpaper . Food ! Food ! You 're made of food ! Aaaahhhh ! I have soiled myself . It 's laxative ! Hannah : The strong dose of laxative must have ... Helped him defecate the evil . Minion : My life is a disgrace . All these years spent as a lackey to the powers of evil . In the end , I sold my fellow seniors out for mere tasty morsels . We must destroy this book of pure evil and its promises of tasty treats ! Why don 't you give me that book before nobody gets - ahhhhh ! Well , there goes the book . Again . Over here ! It 's blocked ! This is what you get for being a satanist kidnapper . I don 't kidnap satanists . Wonderful . Jenny ! You 're alive ! Yeah , great Todd . Little help here ? Let Jenny go , jerkwad ! Kind of busy here ! We need a plan . Already got one . Todd : Ready ? Can someone untie me first ? Todd : Now ! Maybe now it 's nap time ? Wait for it ... ( Heavy metal music ) Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! So gross ! I can taste it ! I 'm going to barf . It always smells like this around here . I 'm running out of poop water ! There 's too many of them ! Curtis : We need more manpower ! I 'm still tied up , guys ! Everyone , load up ! Hurry up guys ! ( Heavy metal music ) Atticus : Ha ha ha ! ( Everyone screams ) Todd ! Watch out ! Ahhhh ! It smells like the day before laundry day . You 'll be okay , granny . Make sure to change your granny panties such a nice boy . Well , atticus , looks like you 'll always remember today as the day we saved you from the attack of the poopy old geezers ! And you 'll remember today as the day that Todd Smith and his friends disappeared and were never seen again - seize them . Minions : Is this the Todd Smith we 've heard so much about ? The pure evil one ! The prophecy ! Yes , the prophecy has been blown completely out of proportion . This teen is no threat . If I 'm not a threat , then you 'll have no problem dueling me for Jenny 's freedom . Mano-a-mano . The pleasure shall be all mine . Minion Bob ! Fight Todd . I think he 's dead . And he pooped his pants . Fine . Minion number one ! I order you to fight Todd ! Minion one : Well , I then sub-order Minion Dave to fight Todd . Does wearing this robe even mean anything anymore ? You 're supposed to follow my orders without question . At least your father promised us everlasting life and prosperity in the next world . Yeah , what the hell have you done for us lately ? How 's this ? Follow my orders and ... I 'll make sure your every dream come true . You don 't sound very convincing . We 'll negotiate later , time is of the essence here . Alright , Sonny , let 's do this . Impressive . He must really be the pure evil one ! Oh shut up ! Ugh ! Oh daddy , what have they done to you ? We have to go to the police ! For all we know the police are satanists too . Yeah this town was founded by satanists . My granny 's a satanist . Your dad 's been drugged for over a year , it 's gonna take some time to get back to normal . Where 'd you get that robot arm ? And where did the sword come from ? And are you two ? Todd : Oh , Jenny ... So much has changed since you were here last . Which was yesterday . Hannah : Is the sword necessary , Todd ? I have negative associations with it . Oh , come on , the sword is totally awesome . You used it to cut off Curtis ' arm . He did what ? ! Yeah , but you think the sword is totally cool , right dude ? Curtis : Well ... Not really dude , you almost killed me with it . But we 're cool now , right ? Why wouldn 't we be ? Hold on , back up a min - fine , maybe I 'll leave the sword at home . I haven 't decided yet . It 's like totally awesome , and maybe we could have a vote about it . I dunno , uh - Jenny : Just tell me what 's going on ! What happened ? Curtis : It all started a couple years ago . Me and Todd had just gotten into heavy metal and shop class . I wanted to make a cool candlestick ... Atticus : So , lemme get this straight , you guys worked for my father ? No . He worked for us . Aren 't you the guys who sell drugs , fireworks and pornography to the kids at my school ? The porn business dried up . Loser Internet , loser . We three have had a long standing arrangement with your little , uh ... Society . My father never told me this . Your old man took a lot of secrets to his grave . What kind of secrets ? Secrets he didn 't want you to know about , loser . Like how the prophecy can mean different things to different people . Depending of course on , how you look at it . I 'm not sure what you 're saying . You have to feel it , loser . Deep inside . Deep inside ? Inside your robe . ( Laughing ) Is the answer embroidered in here , in invisible thread ? This is a waste of time ! Chill out bro ! Dude 's got a lot on his mind man . Look at the prophecy one way ... Todd Smith is the pure evil one . Look at it another and - and what ? It 's - I 'm lost . Wait for it ... Someone else is the pure evil one . And bingo was his name-o . Some who my father didn 't want to have absolute power , someone like - his very own son ? That 's why he kept the secret ? Atticus : Well - ( laughing ) Looks like the jokes on you daddy . Once I get the book of pure evil , absolute power will be mine ? Now that 's the spirit sweater dude . Why you telling me this ? What do you get , if I become the pure evil one ? Well - we 'll work something out . " We 'll work something out . " ( Laughing ) ( Out of control laughing ) Loser .

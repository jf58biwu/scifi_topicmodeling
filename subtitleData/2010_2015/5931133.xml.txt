 Two weeks ago an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . I 'm getting e-mail . The signal 's getting stronger . It 's coming from here . James , I expect you know that I 'm alive . Talk to Lyle Chumley ... No , no . Come on , come on . She was drowning in the lake . She just appeared . I have no idea where she came from . You made a promise 25 years ago to make sure that what we buried stayed buried . Looks like Angie got a piece of whoever did this to her . Those are the fingertips of a hand . - Big hand . - A man 's . Summer ' 88 , Lyle , Sam , Pauline . What ? What is it ? It 's me . The day is coming when there won 't be enough food to sustain us . It may become necessary to thin the herd . This is a census to help you decide who lives and who dies . Good morning . Not sure how good it is . It is if you 're using the census to address our population problem . Well , gotta see where we stand . Well , we know where we stand . We need people who are healthy , with practical skills , who give more than they take . So who 's next ? Alice . She 's the first dome baby . Her mother 's Harriet . She teaches Sunday school . Uh-huh . - What else does Harriet do ? - That 's it . She 's a single mother . Woman of faith . Jim , our food supplies are dwindling . We can 't let these emotions dictate . It won 't be easy ... Listen , I grew up with these people . I was chosen to lead them . I 'm not gonna shake the tree until I 'm sure who can carry their own weight and who can 't . But how will you be sure ? I don 't know . Maybe the dome will guide me . - That 's a start . - Hmm . - What are you up to ? - Um ... I 'm headed to the school . The windmill power project 's really coming along . Listen , Rebecca , we 're gonna get through this . As long as you 're leading us . - Are you okay ? - No . Did Phil ID Angie 's killer from the stuff we found under her fingernails ? That 's a dead end . There 's no way to run the DNA . And half the town probably has scratches after the magnetization . Rebecca Pine thinks Chester 's Mill can 't sustain itself for much longer . And she and Jim wanna use the census to decide who lives and who doesn 't . Wow . I know . It sounds crazy . No . Big Jim 's always had a god complex . I know they have a plan . We need to find out what it is . - We ? - I could use the help . Where does Barbie stand on all this ? On Jim 's side . Jim . We need to talk about your extermination plan . - Reduction option . - Okay , whatever . Look . I know that we need to prepare for the worst . Okay ? But if that day happens , I wanna be clear . No one acts unless we both agree . Listen , Barbie , I don 't want that day to get here any more than you do . Look , Chester 's Mill couldn 't survive the past few days without you . The magnets , the crops , the rain . If we need to take that next step , we do it together . Harriet . There 's so many people here . Makes me feel like Alice has a family . Well , that 's right . One big family . We were so lucky to have you take care of us . Right , Barbie ? That 's right . If this place runs out of food , let 's hope that we 're not on the menu . How can this be ? Yearbooks don 't lie . - It 's from 25 years ago . - This is kind of personal , - but do you have probe marks ? - Joe , please . Save your theory on intelligent life forms of the universe for a TED Talk . Explain her memory loss . And the fact that she hasn 't aged in decades . Maybe the dome sent her . It sent my mom . Hey ! No . Melanie 's a person . The dome sent an avatar . You can 't grab an avatar . Okay , whatever she is , let 's not manhandle her . And since there 's no way she 's actually Melanie Cross , - then we shouldn 't call her that . - What should we call her ? I should know what my name is . But I don 't . We should show him . Yeah , no , the last thing he wants to hear is that you found the fountain of youth in 1988 . Rocking the same clothes as yesterday . - Too busy to come home last night ? - Yeah . Is Julia here ? No . She left a note saying she 'd be back later . What are you guys doing out so early ? - We need to talk to Julia about ... - Yeah , we got e-mails . - You got e-mails when ? - Yesterday . And you 're just telling me about this now ? We all got e-mails until the signal was blocked . This popped up . " This page can 't be displayed . " You think the military 's blocking us or ? That 's not the standard response . We get the signal back , we can communicate with the outside world . I want you to take me where this came through . The devil shall cast some of you into prison , that you may be tried . You shall have tribulation ten days . Be thou faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life . On your feet , Lyle . You came to set me free . My mother said you had answers . I want them . Hey , I can do better than tell you , all right ? I can show you . Let me out . - Put these on . - O ye of little faith . You kidnapped Rebecca and you tried to kill her . She was standing in the way of the Rapture . If I 'm gonna break you out , I want your hands together . Think of it as a prayer . - Thanks for coming over . - How 's the piglet ? I think it 's a flu . I 'm sorry . It 's too late . I 'm worried about the others . She was a newborn . The others are strong . If it 's a flu , they 'll fight it . You know people can catch this too . Are you feeling all right ? I 'm fine . So is Beth . We 've been careful about contact . Good . Um ... Do you have a wheelbarrow ? No sense touching her more than you have to . Everything happens for a reason . - The Wi-Fi signal 's gone . - Disappeared when we got here . This was where it was strongest . Right here ? Yep , because not enough is creepy about that locker . I 'll have to go find something to pry this open with . There 's nothing in there . You don 't know that . It 's locked . How did you know that combination ? I think this was my locker . In 1988 . What ? Okay . What ... ? Is this some kind of joke ? Played on us by the universe . Looks like her , huh ? - That doesn 't make any sense . - And the dome does ? You could be this girl 's daughter . Barbie , you know what it 's like to be a stranger here . I don 't wanna be one anymore . - I 'm not sure I can help you with that . - Why not ? Signal 's gone . Help us figure out who she really is . Let 's go . Oh , Rebecca likes to take her work home with her . Or doesn 't wanna be seen doing it in school . She 's been somewhere with a lot of muck . Eggs for breakfast , blood samples for dinner ? Whatever she 's doing , she 's taking precautions . Yeah , she 's got a calendar of when we run out of food and resources . She really does think it 's the end of days . Our science teacher in a prayer group . That 's new . Huh . She does have an interest in one of God 's creatures . Pigs . Blood work , vet books , mud on the doormat . There are a few farms around here with pigs . Let 's see if she paid a visit to any of them recently . Rebecca ? Hello ? Rebecca ? Working on the windmills ? Rebecca ? We 're supposed to use microfilm in Julia 's newspaper office ? Seriously ? This is how they found things in the Stone Age . Yeah , we can 't search by Melanie 's name ? No . You just gotta scroll and look . I miss the Internet . I miss my cell phone . I miss texting . I miss sushi . Well , the Hall of Records turned up nothing , okay ? This is the last place that I can think to look for whatever it is that we might find . Melanie wasn 't in the ' 87 or ' 89 yearbooks . Maybe The Independent ran an article about why her family came to Chester 's Mill in 1988 . Or why she left . In a town where Betsy Van Needles' record-breaking tomato makes the front page ? - I 'd say we have a pretty good shot . - Guys , look . " Melanie Cross went missing and was never found . " " The family moved to Chester 's Mill from Zenith a short time ago . " Zenith ? That 's the same town that I 'm from . I thought you looked familiar . Melanie 's family lived at 24 Old Oak Drive . If she remembered the combo when she stood in front of her locker , then ... She 'll remember more if we take her to the house ? No . No , she won 't . Because she 's not ... She 's not Melanie Cross . There 's just no way . I wanna go there . I have to . All right . What do we say when we barge in on the family that lives there now ? You let me handle that . Talk to me . Tell me how my mother 's still alive . We had a plan . Severed brake lines , pilfered corpses , that idiot Reverend Coggins , he ... God rest his soul . My mother faked her suicide and you helped her ? - I loved her very much and I still do . - She abandoned me . To protect you . She knew the dome was coming . The pink stars in the paintings ? She had to get out before she was taken out . What does that mean ? Your father had other plans for her . He has no idea that she 's still alive ? No . What about Sam ? Pauline only trusted me to help her escape . What kind of a mother leaves her son behind in this hell ? I think she thought the dome would follow her and spare you . I had to go to her funeral . She left me here . She left me to turn into Big Jim Rennie . Look , your mother trusts me . For nine years , that 's how Pauline stayed in touch . Postcards ? Yeah . They 're from all different places , but there 's nothing on them . Yeah , there is . She made those . Turn them over . Her paintings . Do those look familiar ? This is all the stuff that happened since the dome came down . The egg , the butterflies , the red rain ... If she 's out there , how could she possibly know what 's going on here ? Pauline saw a lot more than pink stars . I don 't see any windmills . You stole my card , lied to me . What are you doing , Rebecca ? I 'm finding a way . When the dome first came down , I started visiting farms , monitoring crops and livestock . Tom Tilden had a sick pig . The flu . What 's inside the eggs , Rebecca ? You said you 'd do what it takes to save this town . What 's inside those eggs is how you 're gonna do it . Hello ? Left the front door unlocked . Probably went to the parade in Westlake and got trapped outside the dome on Dome Day . Lucky them . Didn 't even finish breakfast . Some kid didn 't have to finish his algebra homework and avoided the hamster ball . Double win . - Does it look familiar ? - I don 't remember anything . Because there 's nothing to remember . All I feel is sad . It sucked having to walk through my house with my family gone . And after Angie , I 'm glad the place fell down . How am I supposed to compete with a girl he thinks is from a galaxy far , far away ? Uh , I 'm sure he 's just trying to help . Don 't undermine my feelings of jealousy and abandonment . But since we 're chatting , what 's up with you and Julia ? Come on , you show up with the " please forgive me " face , she left before you got there , so she didn 't wanna hear it . Whatever you did was super bad . Your eyebrow just twitched . Yeah , it did . Really glad we could have this little chat . Barbie . Nor . Oh , my God . I made these . I used to look out the window and see them falling . She saw stars fall ? - They were pink . - Yeah , over there . I went out to find them . That 's where we found the mini-dome . - We gotta go there . - Joe , slow down . The dome came out of nowhere and changed our lives forever . Angie was killed , I might never know why . This is a chance to find an answer . To find one damn answer . - Even if it 's not for me . - I think we should look . All right . We go to the woods . If we find nothing , we go home . Thank you . - Six farms and nothing . - Still one to go . Yeah , but according to the farmers , Rebecca was only monitoring livestock and crop yields . She said the point of the town census was to inventory resources . - Maybe ... - What ? Maybe she 's not planning anything bad . No , no , no . You didn 't hear what I heard in her voice . Or see her douse Lyle with that acid rain . Though , it wouldn 't be the first time I 've misjudged someone . I don 't really know you . Hell , I 've been out in the woods for so long , there are days I don 't even know myself . But I do know that I 've been betrayed before . What are you getting at , Sam ? People are full of surprises . They sure are . How long have you been planning this ? I 'd been monitoring the pig for weeks . Testing blood at my house to see how the virus affected cells . When were you gonna tell me ? Once everything was ready . That 's why I needed to get in here , to mix the swine flu with samples of influenza . In a few hours the recombinant virus inside those eggs will be strong enough to infect one-quarter of this town . You wanna release it ? No . I want you to . You want me to play God ? You said you wanted to see who could carry their own weight . This is how . It 's not God , it 's ... It 's Darwin . It 's survival of the fittest . - Meaning we 're at risk too . - Yes . A virus is nature 's way of leveling the playing field . This is crazy . It 's merciful . In seven days , we run out of food . In 14 , people will be starving . In 21 , we 'll turn on each other . The time to act is now . How 'd this virus get inside the dome ? It 's always been here . Dormant in nature for weeks , months , maybe years . You mean like an incubator . The dome made this happen . You 're saying my mom 's a prophet ? I 'm saying that these events brought us closer to the apocalypse . When the world 's gonna burn with sacred fires and our ashes float up into heavens , that 's when I 'm gonna be with Pauline again . The rain , I thought presaged the end of days , because that 's the last card I got . Well , whatever it was , it was a good thing that Rebecca stopped it . Hey , if she interfered with the dome 's plan , we 'll be condemned to purgatory under this thing for all of time . - Forever , forever , forever ... - Lyle , settle down or the cuffs are going back on . Look , these couldn 't have come after the dome came down . - Maybe we don 't know how it ends . - You 're right . Postcards stopped . But she did write in her journal every day . I bet you the key to this is in the journal . My uncle came and picked up a bunch of her stuff after the funeral . She wouldn 't want Sam to have her journal . Not him . - What is it with you guys anyway ? - Doesn 't matter . Let 's get the journal . No , no , no , I ... You don 't wanna know about your mother ? What about that girl that got killed ? Angie ? - Why would you say that ? - I have a real clear view of the Sweetbriar Rose from my porch . I 've watched you waiting for her to pick her up after her shift . - Sorry about what happened to her . - Wait . Do you think my mom put Angie 's murder in her journal ? Oh , thank God . Did Rebecca send you to help ? Help with what ? She said it 'd be just the one pig , but she was wrong . There are more . Just since this morning . A dozen of them . - Quarantine the healthy animals . - Yeah . This is what Rebecca was messing around with in her kitchen . That pig virus is their extermination plan . Yeah , and she doesn 't know how strong it is . We 've gotta find them before they release it . Where would they do it ? Someplace busy , someplace public . Jim 's having a town meeting at the Sweetbriar . That 's where they 'll be . This is where Julia brought me , she showed me the mini-dome . Melanie , where are you going ? She 's going to the exact spot where it was . Are you all right ? What just happened ? I remember . It was night . I came here looking for where the pink stars fell with Pauline Verdreaux . - Junior 's mom ? - Yes . We were with Sam Verdreaux and Lyle Chumley . They were our boyfriends . You and Sam ? My head is exploding . Hold on . And then what happened ? I don 't know . That spot . It 's bringing back your memory . If you wanna know more about who you are , you have to get back on it . - What is it ? - Looks like a meteor . - It 's glowing . - Let 's go see . We found a meteorite . Right here . Maybe we 're supposed to touch it . When we touched it , it cracked open . Is everybody okay ? Are you okay ? There was an egg inside . Oh , my God . What is that ? Melanie , stop ! - Melanie , what are you doing ? - Put it back . Don 't do that . - I took it . - Put it down . I wanted to protect it . - Melanie , put it back . - Where are you going ? - Hey , come back . - Mel ... Melanie . Melanie ! Sam told me to put it back , but I wouldn 't . - Drop it , Melanie . Put it back ! - Hey ! - Are you okay ? - What is happening ? The sound 's killing me ! I am Melanie Cross . And I think this is where I died . - Is the virus ready ? - Yes . Are you ? No one tells you what it 's like . Being the one who has to decide . You were chosen because you 're strong enough to do it . I was tested like this before . What happened ? It 's my wife , Pauline . She got sick . She started seeing things and got paranoid , had these spells . She was mentally ill . That 's ... That 's not your fault . I knew she needed help , so I found this facility a few towns away . She begged me not to take her there , promised she 'd get better . And I gave in . Didn 't make her go . Because I loved her . I believed that would be enough . But it wasn 't . She took her own life . I 'm sorry . If I 'd made the tough choice , the right choice , maybe she would 've gotten better . Maybe she 'd be alive . This time , I 'll make that choice . My mother died when I was 8 . Her heart just stopped . We were riding our bikes around the Army base , and suddenly she was just ... gone . I asked my dad why , and he said , " Sometimes there are no answers . " That 's why I turned to science . If you look hard enough , there is an answer . You 'll need to distribute it in water . The crowd will increase the rate of infection . I know the place . Back in 1988 , you , Sam , Pauline and Lyle were the original four hands . And you found an egg too ? And some jackass killed her because of it . Are you sure you didn 't see who pushed you ? It wasn 't Pauline . She was freaking out . Lyle was really mad , so was Sam . I just wanted to protect the egg . What was that ? It feels like a rock . Yeah , a rock from outer space . Initials , M.C. Melanie I believe this is yours . If I died , then what am I ? And why are you here ? And where are your bones ? I bet Sam Verdreaux can answer those questions . Yeah . He was there that night . And if all this is true , he 's seen Melanie the last couple of days . I mean , he helped Julia save her life . Wouldn 't you remember your ex-girlfriend ? But he acts like he never even knew her . Maybe it 's not an act , though . And maybe he 's the one who killed her . It 's either him or Lyle . But Sam loved me . Well , he 's hiding something . Hey , Big Jim . Caught those vandals that were defacing the bridge . Good job , Phil . Keep it up . Jim ! I was just getting something to drink before the big meeting . What 's ... ? Nobody drink the water . Jim , you need anything ? Yeah . I need these two escorted out of here . Why ? So you can dump a deadly flu virus into the drinking water ? What are you talking about ? You think you get to control who lives and who dies ? All right , everybody , calm down . I don 't know what these two are talking about . I 'd be more than happy to tell everybody - about how you and Rebecca ... - Do you wanna listen to someone trying to make Chester 's Mill a better place , or do you wanna believe the town drunk and the town 's ... ? Well , I 'm too much of a gentleman to say . You can call me whatever you want after you empty your pockets . I don 't got anything to prove to you . Careful with that . What 's this ? Where is it ? Where 's the virus ? What virus ? Rebecca has it . Shouldn 't be going through my uncle 's stuff like this . Hey , if your mom 's journal 's here , it doesn 't belong to Sam . It 's not his stuff , it belongs to you . It 's the only way - to bring forth the Four Horsemen . - Okay , enough with the Rapture crap . This is it , right ? - I 've been waiting a long time for that . - Give it back . I need it all to be with Pauline , and there are pages missing ! - I 'm calling the shots here , Lyle . - No . No . Lyle ! Okay . What did you find ? Suddenly , the nonbeliever seeks enlightenment . Does it say something about Angie ? What don 't you want me to see ? You could 've followed her to the school that night . You killed Angie and you used me to get out . Why did I have to do that , huh ? I 'm sorry , kid , but I 'm out for good now . Welcome . You can light a candle if you like . Welcome . Feel free to light a candle . Welcome . Good to see you . Hello . Take a seat , please . Nice to see you . Welcome . Good to see you . More than half my pigs are dead . The virus is out of control . More are sick . Town needed them . Why did this happen to us ? Sometimes there are no answers , Tom . Try to have faith . We 'll get through this together . What do you think ? Rebecca ! Get away from me . You tried to kill us all . Julia , I didn 't do it . I didn 't release it . - Get away from there . - Just check my purse . Carefully . Crisis of conscience ? I heard the virus mutated . I will go as far as I need to , but not farther . - I 'll get the jail cell ready . - I didn 't do anything . Road to hell 's paved with good intentions . Oh , so now you and Julia are gonna save the town , huh ? How are you gonna feed the people when you run out of food ? - Not by killing them . - Oh , yeah ? That 's easy for you to say . You never had the balls to make the tough decisions . When Pauline started losing her mind and killed herself , you just ran to the bottle . Now you 're running off to Julia . Yeah , and you 're running your mouth off as usual . - What are you doing here ? - She 's joining you in jail . You released the virus . - The same thing you were gonna do . - Jim would never go through with it . You love this town too much . That 's why I took the virus . You used me . I couldn 't do it either . But it was your idea . You 're the one who talked me into this plan . When I realized the virus mutated , I questioned myself and remembered what you said . I can 't play God . You know what ? Plenty of time for you guys to talk about this downstairs . Tomorrow we 'll have a town meeting and the people can decide your fate . What are you gonna do to us ? Me ? Nothing . My hope is that you 'll be put on trial . Yeah . Well , let 's hope you bring your boyfriend . The people would be very interested in what Barbie has to say about this virus . - Why is that ? - Because he was the first one on board . Junior ? He 's still breathing . Hey , Junior , wake up . Junior , wake up . - Come on . - My head . - Why did Sam do this ? - No , it was Lyle . - Lyle 's in jail . - No , he 's not . He 's ... He 's gone . - He took my mother 's journal . - What journal ? Easy , easy . Hey , where did Lyle go ? No , I don 't know , but I think he killed Angie . Maybe he killed me too . Joe , come on , help me . Help me get him up , come on . Let 's go . What 's next ? What comes after an extermination plot ? Hey , we made it through the day . And the guys behind that plan are behind bars . Big Jim 's probably lying on a lumpy cot missing his own bed right about now . Yeah . He 's had better nights . Now we can put the census to good use , figure out how to share resources . Thank you . For what ? I showed up on your door at dawn with an insane theory , you didn 't blink . You 're pretty convincing . You believed me . That means something . Excuse me . - Hey . - No . No , Julia . Hey , listen . You gotta listen to me . Not tonight . You okay ? I will be . Good . I 'm glad . Oh . Ah , I 'm sorry . I don 't know what I was thinking . I 'll go . I ... No , no , no . Please stay . Let 's not make it weird . - Okay . - Okay . The whole town 's gonna want answers in the morning . I could really use your help coming up with what those are . Honey ? Yeah . Thanks .

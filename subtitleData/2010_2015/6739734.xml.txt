( CAMERA SHUTTER ) ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) U.S. Ambassador Arnold Regis was assassinated this morning along with the top Venezuelan diplomat he was with . Someone blew up their boat . I need you to get down to the Orinoco River in the Amazon Basin immediately . Colonel Antonio Diaz is running the investigation from Puerto Ayacucho about 20 clicks downriver from the explosion . He 's claiming it was terrorists . The CIA thinks it could be the start of an anti-American military coup . I need you to check out that river bottom and tell me what really happened before we have another Afghanistan on our hands . Do whatever it takes and do it fast . And Fitch ... Yes , sir ? Good luck . Thank you , sir . * * BEEP , BEEP , BEEP We 're close . BEEP , BEEP , BEEP Very close . ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) Monroe ... look . BEEP , BEEP , BEEP We need to get a piece of that debris to the lab immediately . Chemical compounds on the boat shard are identical to the L-23 mutation strain . ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) And the diameter of these marks are significantly wider than a normal jaw . How much wider ? At least four times . It HAS to be them . They must be doubling in size every few days . No ... no , no . They are growing exponentially . If this is correct , they may be doubling in size every 36 hours . See if you can pulla decent DNA sampleoff the boat shard . We have to contact Colonel Diaz immediately . It is imperative . All river traffic must be stopped . I 've already told Colonel Diaz . He won 't listen . All he cares about is keeping people out of that jungle . And you know why . Look . If you want to keep this lab open , you have to keep your theories to yourself . How much time until the piranha hit their next magnitude ? At the most . Twenty-four hours ? Well then we need to stop them before that . * * Jason Fitch , U.S. State Department . ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) I 'm sorry . My Spanish is a little rusty . I 'm here to meet with Colonel Antonio Diaz . Come on ! Whatever you say , boss . They sent you out from the State Department , right ? About that boat that wasdestroyed this morning ? No comment . Please , stop . My name is Sarah Monroe . I 'm a genetics professor from UCLA . I 've been working with the ISFRP for the past two years on a hydro-biological experiment . Hydro-biological ? What 's that have to do ... ? We increase the local food supply by genetically redesigning certain species of fish to make them more robust . I was in charge of the Serrasalmus , more commonly known as " piranha " . I really don 't have time to talk about this . Have to go meet ... Colonel Diaz , I know . Please , listen . One of my test groups , Lot L-23 an especially blood-thirsty , grotesquely large strain that I labeled " Serrasalmus Gigantus " , they became uncontrollable and had to be terminated . However , I do believe that they 've either been stolen or they 've escaped and are now breeding in the wild . This sounds like a problem for the fishing industry . You don 't get it ! They ate those people . They ate the whole damned boat , and if we don 't do something in the next 24 hours , they 're gonna grow and grow and grow , and take everything out in their path . ( SIGHS ) Diaz thinks I 'm crazy . Here . Take my card . Come to the lab and see for yourself . It 's a piece of the hull . Maybe you can convince Diaz better than I have . Okay . Alright . And be careful . He 's a closed minded , paranoid son of a bitch . Yeah . Come on ! * * * * * * ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) ( HEAVY SPANISH ACCENT ) Guns for China are good . We don 't need the United States any more . Hahahaha . Senior Fitch , welcome to the Amazon . ( CAMERA SHUTTER ) Listen . On behalf of my country , I wish to express my deepest sympathy , and I assure you that the criminals responsible for this will be brought to justice . I 've reserved you a private room here on our base . ( LAUGHS ) I planned on staying in a hotel , Colonel . Nonsense . This way , I know exactly where you are . I 'm not a ballistics expert , but I can 't detect any carbon , sulfur , or heat of any kind . See right over here , where the wood isn 't torn ... Yes . These little serrated edges ? Has anyone suggested this boat was attacked by animals ? Animals ? You mean like alligators ? Or maybe a group of animals working together . So ... that 's who you were talking to at the airport , eh ? That crazy American scientist , eh ? ! Well she had nothing to do with it . All she wants is money . Let me tell you something . These serrations were made AFTER the explosion . Okay ? From sunfish gnawing at the carbon ! I need to dive the river right away . Told Secretary Grady that I would . We wouldn 't want to disappoint Secretary Grady , would we ? No , Colonel , we wouldn 't . I 'll make sure I fly you there immediately . Lead the way . ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) * * We 're approaching the location of the boat 's last radio transmission . When are we gonna land ? We 're not gonna land . This is the jungle , Mr. Fitch . As far as the eye can see , there 's no place to land . Then why the hell are we in a helicopter , Colonel ? I need to dive that river right away and find out if this was an explosion or an animal attack . It was an explosion ! This area is now off limits . Anything to be done here , will be done by myself . My country needs answers , Colonel ! Your country ? What about my country , eh ? You Americans come here , treat us like we 're from a third world country , like we 're children , we can 't take care of ourselves ! We 're not children , Senior Fitch ! And you can tell Grady that from me . * * ( CROWD YELLING ) REPORTER : Anti-American protests were seen on the streets of Caracas , Venezuala this afternoon following the assassination of U.S. Ambassador Arnold Regis the primary architect of the now-controversial Pan-American Free Trade Initiative . No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack . Screw this ! * * * * * * * * * * ( MUSIC , NO SOUND ) Can you take me up river ? Let 's go . What is going on down there ? They just pulled me out of a meeting . Colonel Diaz asked me to remove you from the case and wants you gone by this afternoon . There 's something going on with Colonel Diaz , but it has nothing to do with that boat . That 's the river itself . Got to be a submerged mine or animal attack . Maybe gators or fish . Fish ? Yeah , fish . An American scientist down here suggested a group of piranha . Alright , alright . You just keep doing what you 're doing , but send me the report immediately . Yes , sir . I 'll fend off Colonel Diaz , tell him I can 't get you out until tomorrow . Thank you , sir . And , Fitch , that doesn 't give you much time . So get on it . Look , If I 'm not back here in 20 minutes , I want you to call Secret ... On second thought ... here ... 20 minutes , call this woman . Okay ? Not back , 20 minutes . ( IN SPANISH ) Yes sir . Thank you . No problem . ( PRESSURIZED BREATHING ) ( PRESSURIZED BREATHING ) ( SNARLING ) ( SNARLING ) ( SNARLING , BITING ) ( PANTING ) GRRRR ! ( SNARLING ) What the fuck ? ! Yeah , Secretary Grady , I figured it out . It wasn 't an explosion , and it wasn 't terrorists . It was giant piranha . Yes , sir . Giant piranha . I know ... I will . I 'll keep you informed , sir . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . So ... think a bunch of these could make a boat disappear ? What the hell is this ? Genetically modified piranha , your terrorist . There 's an inlet by the river has a whole school of these things . Boat wreckage everywhere . These , these creatures ? They 're man made ? The results of a failed experiment . I found ' em , Colonel . Now all we need to do is figure out how to kill ' em . Here ... it 's the exact coordinates where they are . Lattitude 5.8 degrees north . Longitude 67 degrees west . Now what I 'm gonna do is take our fish here over to our crazy American scientist friend . She helped design these things . Maybe she can figure out a way to exterminate them . Oh , and if Secretary Grady didn 't tell you , I 'm not leaving today . Have a nice day , Colonel . Ayudante ! Knock , knock ! A little present for you guys . Oh my God . That 's the sample we needed . This thing 's incredible . Gordon , I need you to get me a projection of the size ratio data . We need to establish migration patterns . I 'm on it . Are there any of these things left ? Yeah . Maybe hundreds . I think they were trapped . Trapped by what ? Let me show you . I took a picture . Here ... it 's a natural dam separating the piranhas from the rest of the river . Now that 's good . That 's good , uh , for now . But when they get any bigger , they 'll break right through that thing . Okay , fine . So let 's put a wire in the water and electrocute ' em . No , no , no . That 's untested results . It could cause reproduction , additional mutations ... Massive growth . Any number of things . Okay , fine . Let 's poison them , dropsome acid in there.No. No , there 's only one way to do this . We have to reinforce the dam with concrete slabs . We drain the estuary . The L-23 Serrasalmus Gigantus will suffocate . We 'll drown them . The only other option is hitting them with much more fire power than we can find around here . I think you better see this . This specimen has at least half a dozen new organs . Look : two hearts , triple thick skin , and it 's a hermaphrodite . It breeds on its own . This is Fitch . SECRETARY GRADY : Listen , Fitch ... You have to get back to the base immediately . Diaz is up to something . What ? Not sure , but whatever it is , it 's big . Okay . On my way up there right now . And it looks like the scientists found a way to kill those piranha . Learn what you can . Yes , sir . Report back to me . Keep you informed . Yes , sir . I have those projections you asked for ! You better see this . Right now , the piranha are in one spot but if they migrate down the Orinoco into other rivers , this is what happens : 12 hours ... 24 hours ... 36 hours . By 48 , they reach the Mississippi . I 'm going . Fitch ! What ? You need to convince Colonel Diaz to start reinforcing that dam tonight , before these things get any bigger . I 'm coming with you . We 'll take my car . Yeah , look . Follow me , just don 't talk . Good . We need to speak with him , too . She 's a diplomat Americana . Muy important to the case . Okay . Vamanos . Took French in school . That was smooth . ( LOUDSPEAKER , ALARMS RINGING ) ( IN SPANISH ) Follow me . It 's this way . Colonel ! Colonel , I need to talk to you . Who 's she ? The scientist from UNESCO that I told you about . Professor Monroe . We spoke over the phone many times , I think . Oh , so that was you . Well strap yourself in . We 're in for a bumpy ride . ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) Where are we going , Colonel ? To a secluded inlet . You 've convinced me , Senior Fitch . Those piranhas where all the evidence I needed . You 're not gonna bomb them , are you ? Of course I 'm going to attack them . I 'm a soldier . You need to build a wall to reinforce that dam , and drain the estuary . There 's no time to build a wall ! I want to kill these things myself . This thing ends tonight ! These choppers don 't have enough fire power , Colonel ! Give me 15 hours and I can have a U.S. Destroyer here with enough fire power to kill ALL those damn fish . ( ROCKETS , MACHINE GUN FIRE ) It 's working . The missiles are killing them . I want the rest of those helicopters up in the air , right now ! Drop the rest of the missiles ! NOW ! ( ROCKETS , MACHINE GUN FIRE ) MONROE : You can 't do this ! Colonel , this plan is FUBAR ! ( MISSILES FIRING , EXPLOSIONS ) * * Congratulations , Fitch . You know , this one had me really worried . Reports up here showed massive casualties along the entire river if those creatures weren 't put down fast . Yeah . Thank you , sir . Diaz quarantined the whole area off . There 's a couple of scientists from Professor Monroe 's lab down there now trying to make that the Colonel killed all those things . Good . Let 's close this case . The Venezuelan government is not happy , and there 's talk about closing that laboratory and arresting every one of those scientists . That 's crazy ! Those scientists were trying to help us . I know . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm flying down to Caracas tonight to smooth things out at the Capitol . Relations are bad to say the least . Listen , you keep Diaz happy . Don 't make any waves , and hopefully by tomorrow night , we 'll both be heading back home . Hope so , sir . Do my best . Ah , Senior Jason Fitch , eh . Salud . Salud ! Hahahaha . I hope your time here was well spent , eh . So they tell me you 're leaving in the morning , eh ? Yes , Colonel . If Secretary Grady 's happy , I 'll be more than happy to get out of here . What happened to that little girlfriend of yours , eh ? She 'll be along in a little while . Is she unhappy that her little creatures are gone ? Nah . I can 't imagine that . Have you been to this laboratory of hers ? 'Cause , you know , I think I 'd like to see it . It 's nothing much . I see ... you like her , but maybe she 's got some other experiment that might go wrong , eh ? So , would you say this is a helpful thing you do here ? Yes , of course ! Our most successful projects feed 30 % of of the people in this country . Successful projects ? What about your UNSUCCESSFUL projects , eh ? Well , Colonel , there 's only been one . ( LAUGHING ) Hmm . Colonel Diaz , the scientists here are trying to help people . And we 're sanctioned by the United Nations . Oh , well , the United Nations . ( LAUGHING ) How charitable . These American scientists have been conducting illegal scientific experiments in MY country . You understand ? MY COUNTRY ! This facility is now CLOSED ! Bar up all the doors , and the windows ! I need you to go . Take my car and go ! I 'm not leaving without you . You 're no good to anyone if you get arrested . Now go ! Colonel Diaz , you can 't do this ! I know what you do in the jungle . ARREST HER ! AYUDANTE : You 're under arrest ! ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Get Fitch , too ! Higgins , I 've collected 46 dead L-23s and there 's only a few left on the surface . And that 's not NEARLY enough . Yeah , I 've only gotten about 35 specimens so far . You 're absolutely right . There 's no way we got them all . Look , I gotta get out of here ... I see one of Diaz ' gunboats coming . I gotta get out of here . Higgens ? Shit . ( WATER RIPPLING , BOAT ENGINE ) BEEP ... BEEP ... BEEP , BEEP , BEEP BEEP , BEEP , BEEP-BEEP-BEEP CRASH ! GRRRR ! ( SNARLING , BITING ) ( METAL CREAKING ) * * Sorry . You made it . You 're safe . You scared the shit out of me ! Diaz ' men have been chasing me all night . I think I lost them . How 'd the dam hold up ? It 's totally blown apart . Nothing 's holding them in anymore . It 's no wonder they escaped . Diaz was using grenades and machineguns to try and kill ' em . We need a full-blown assault . Come on ! ( IN SPANISH ) Stop ! It 's alright . No , no , no . It 's alright . Muy bueno , muy bueno ! Muy bueno , muy bueno ! AHHH ! I GOTTA HELP HIM ! ( SNARLING , BITING ) ( SCREAMING , BITING ) AHHH ! AHH ! AHHH ! ( BITING , SPLASHING ) THUD ! ( ELECTRONIC WHIR ) Nothing yet , sir . They 're still in there . SECRETARY GRADY : According to the reports , Diaz is planning to move them to an unknown location shortly . Do NOT lose them . This is a real mess , Fitch . And those fish are still out there . Did you hear about the attack last night ? Yes , sir . Twenty men . An entire gunboat . Diaz claims it 's a CIA plot to take over his country , and Caracas is just along for the ride . So I 'm conducting diplomacy at the I.S.B. installation 60 miles north of Aruba . You 've got to keep those scientists safe , Fitch , and get them here . They 're the only ones who know how to kill those fish . Yes , sir . I 'll do my best , sir . ( ELECTRONIC WHIR ) ( MUFFLED CRIES ) I don 't know what you mean . I mean that the three of you are conducting illegal scientific experiments AND MAKING UP STORIES ABOUT ME IN ORDER TO COVER IT UP , EH ? That 's ridiculous . UHH ! Hahaha . Believe me , when you get to the Guianas Prison District ... ( LAUGHING ) things are gonna get a lot worse . Look ... I don 't care what you do . I don 't care who you work for . I don 't care if you 're Cartel ! THEN SIGN THAT DOCUMENT ! SIGN IT ! Say that you 're part of the CIA and all of your colleagues are part of the CIA . You don 't get it . We have to stay here and kill those piranha before they get so big that you CAN 'T STOP ' EM ! ( PUNCHING , LAUGHTER ) ( PUNCHING , CRIES OF PAIN ) ( MUFFLED BLOWS ) ( ELECTRONIC WHIR ) Oh my God ! What did they do to you ? ! I 'll be fine . ( IN SPANISH ) Bring them . Faster ! Get in , get in . Let 's go . ( LOUD SIREN ) ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING , SIRENS ) Stay there , don 't move ! HONK !

It 's the harbor . We have to go there . Now ! Come on ! GORDON : Come on ! ( DISTANT EXPLOSIONS ) MONROE : Come on . Hurry , hurry ! MONROE : Oh my God ! Come on . Let 's go ! Come on . CRASH ! BOOM ! Come on . Keep going ! Come on . KABOOM ! The Serrasalmus are BIGGER . CRASH ! SPLAT ! The piranha are heading toward the ocean . You might be able to catch ' em . Okay . Why don 't you guys go that way ? I 'm gonna go do more testing on the water . Alright . Be careful . What 's that do ? It detects fish sonar , so I can get a direction . This breed is gonna keep moving . How are there so many of them ? We blew the hell out of them . Look . Their gestation period is only six hours . They absorb nutrients directly through their skin so they just grow and multiply , as if they were composed completely of stem cells from Serrasalmus zygotes . AHHHH ! Oh , hell . Stay here ! ( CRIES OF PAIN ) Hey , hey . Easy . You 're gonna be okay . Shhh-shh . Just relax . You 're gonna be okay . GROWRR ! UGH ! ( GRUNTING , KICKING ) Are you okay ? Yeah . I 've tested it three times . The fish are definitely headed northeast , toward the ocean . That 's good . That helps us . We gotta warn beach resorts along the coast . Piranhas are freshwater fish . They can 't breath in saltwater . They 'll never go near it . Soon as they reach the river mouth , with that saltwater , it 'll be like hitting a brick wall . Good . Now we know exactly where to hit ' em . They 're gonna be trapped . They 're not gonna get away this time . NOOO ! NO ! SARAH , NO ! Sarah , no ! He 's gone . He 's gone , he 's GONE ! I need to get you to the embassy . Come on . EMBASSY ? ! I 'm not going to an embassy ! We 've gotta follow the piranha right down to the river and find someone , anyone , to kill them and bomb them ! I JUST WANT TO KILL THEM ALL ! Come on ! Go ! Come on ! Get in ! Guys , I 've been working on the size of these things . Based on the fish that escaped last month , the larger ones we collectedlast night , and the hugeones we saw today ... And ? Based on my calculations , these things are doubling in size in half the amount of time we expected , and then doubles again within each growth cycle . Okay , how about numbers that mean something ? They 'll be the size of a horse by the time they reach the mouth of the river . Eight hours after that , a rhinoceros . Four hours later , an elephant . Then a whale . According to this , I don 't see any point at which they 'll stabilize . ( PHONE RINGS ) Secretary Grady . What the hell is going on there , Fitch . There 's a warrant out for your arrest . We just witnessed a massive attack , sir . The entire harbor was destroyed . And we lost Dr. Higgins . Let me know what you need . I 'll see what I can do . I need you to bombard the mouth of the Orinoco River . Heavy ordinance , everything you 've got . Where the freshwater meets the salt . That 's where the piranha will be in a few hours . Bombard the river mouth ? ! Are you out of your goddamned mind ? For openers , Venezuela is a sovereign nation and one , I might add , whose diplomatic relationship with us is not doing very well . I understand that , sir , but if we don 't hit these things now , hard , they are going to grow and breed and spread up and down this coast until there is NOTHING left . This is our one chance to do this , sir . Alright , alright . I 'm gonna send you a link to our satellite feed that 's been tracking your giant piranhas . Do you need a GPS ? I have one . I 'll also send a ship to the river mouth , but JUST to observe . At zero-nine-fifty hours , send in a personal distress SOS , and that ship will respond outside of official jurisdiction . Maybe that way we can avoid starting World War III . Yes , sir . Hour and fifteen . We got it . And , Fitch , that ship must be just passing by . He can 't wait for you . That S.O.S. must be sent at exactly zero-nine-five-zero . Otherwise , that window is lost . How long does it take to get to the coast ? About two hours . Yeah . Well , I 've gotta do it a lot shorter than that . I 'd hang on if I was you . ( GROWLING ) MONROE : Is that a checkpoint ahead ? Damn it . We don 't have time for this . You two get down and stay down . Guys , make yourselves invisible . THUD ! Guys , we 've got somebody following us . Hang on ! Where ? On our six . On our six ? What ? Behind us .

Stay down until I make sure , though . Step out of the car ! Even you , Senior Fitch . Or we start shooting ! ( IN SPANISH ) Listen , friend . I don 't want to hurt you . I just want you to clear our names ! ( IN SPANISH ) They 're not here . This way ! Let 's go ! ( IN SPANISH ) Look for them . Over here . Let 's go . They 're this way . Let 's go , let 's go ! ( GROWLING ) We 're entering the firing range window , Captain . Has the call come in ? Not yet , sir . BEEP . BEEP , BEEP How much time do we have before we 're out of range . One minute . The Piranha aren 't here yet . They 're gonna be here any second . Okay . Get back . I 'm gonna call in the strike . Here they come ! ( LOUD BUBBLING ) MOVE ! They 're only gonna be trapped between the freshwater and saltwater for a few minutes . Now 's the time to hit them . I 'm trying ! This thing 's almost out of juice .

Suck on the battery . The acid in your mouth will give you 10 % extra charge . WE DON 'T WANT TO HURT YOU ! WE JUST NEED YOU TO HELP US STOP THE KILLING ! Come on , Fitch . Come on ! Where the hell are you ? How much time is left ? Twenty seconds . YOU CAN STILL CLEAR OUR NAMES ! WORKING TOGETHER , WE CAN HELP OUR PEOPLE . IF YOU DON 'T SURRENDER , I 'LL BE FORCED TO SHOOT YOU AS SPIES ! ( LAUGHING ) Five seconds ! Now ! ( PHONE DIALING ) ( PHONE RING ) Yes ? SOS . Repeat , SOS !

Let me check the water . Be careful . There 's not a sound . I don 't detect a single piranha . Not here , not upriver . I think this killed them ! Yeah ? Yes ! ( LAUGHING ) Hate to break up this tender moment , but it 's not safe here . We still have Diaz and his men on our asses . Let 's go ! Through those trees ! They 're headed towardthe beach . Let 's sendtwo heli 's to pick ' em up . Yes Sir . Alright , we 'll move along this beach , head up the coast . I can get us an evac from there . It should be easily accessible . Oh no ! RAWRR !

The piranhas , they 're headed to the ocean ! Now that they can live in saltwater , anything else I should know ? They don 't sleep , they have three stomachs , and ... Hang on ! ( MACHINE GUN FIRE ) They 're firing at us ? ! I thought they wanted us alive ! Yeah , well , things change . ( MACHINE GUNS ) Come on . Turn , turn , turn ! ( MACHINE GUNS ) ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) Incoming ! AHHHH ! AHHHH ! AHHHH ! ( MACHINE GUNS ) MONROE : Slow down ! Diaz is flying west ! Good . Let him . We got bigger problems to deal with . What direction are the piranhas going ? Out . Straight out to the ocean , to the east . Okay , then we 're gonna head north . North ? ! Why north ? We should go back to the shore then . It 's all ocean . Why back there ? To be arrested AGAIN ? ! No , there 's a closer place that we can go to . Besides , we wouldn 't make it back to shore . We took a bullet . Fuel line 's leaking . Maybe I can rig something . Good . We 're running on fumes here , guys ! There 's got to be a can of SOMETHING in here . Hope so . Sure would suck to die because we ran out of gas . I got you into this mess . Least I can do is try to get you out . There 's an oxygen tank ... I can use this ! No , no , no . You can 't use that ! This is a combustion engine . It needs gasoline , kerosene , anything that can burn . Yeah , I know . I can make anything burn . Okay , well , you know what ? Please do it fast , because we are going down . Okay , I got it . Ready for a boost ? Hit it ! Woahhh ! Screw science , you guys should be working for NASCAR . This is only gonna last a few minutes . That 's okay . A few minutes is all I need . Look ! There it is . What 's that ? It 's the I.S.B. military installation , Western Hemisphere . Pretty sweet , huh ? Hang on . We 're going down . There 're only four of these installations in the entire world . Each one houses200,000 refugesin case of emergency . Emergency ? Like what , nuclear war ? That or a planet killing meteor , super volcano blast ... Okay , we got it . A thousand year mega ice age ... What are you ? Some kind of bigwig ? Nah . I 'm just an analyst . First we 're gonna meet with Secretary Bob Grady and some others . They 're gonna ask you direct questions . Just give them direct answers . Just think of everybody here as average , normal people . Good to have you back , sir . At ease , gentlemen . The longer we stand here , the bigger the Serrasalmus are getting . And if they decide to change direction , this island is right in their path . We are in an impenetrable fortress , Professor , surrounded by aircraft carriers and missile cruisers . I 've seen what they can do to your missile cruisers . We have a LOT of fire power . Trust me , you don 't have enough . And in a few hours , you 're gonna need twice as much as you need right now . Yeah , you need to listen . She 's right . You need to hit these things hard and fast with everything you got right now . I agree with Professor Monroe . She 's the expert , she knows the enemy . Now , our experts are tracking the entire group of giant piranha traveling in an arc east to due north . That puts them in Southern Florida by later this afternoon . So , what can we expect ? Will they stop ? Do they sleep ? No . These organisms are on a very simple program to create as much protein meat as possible . They eat , they grow , they multiply . And they will never ever stop . Oh , we 're gonna stop them alright . But the Greenpeacers won 't like the way we do it . What does that mean ? We have a nuclear submarine set to intercept the piranha in one hour . As soon as those creatures are far enough from land , we nuke ' em . Twenty kilotons . Enough to wipe out New York City . If you want my opinion , as a Greenpeacer , I 'd double that amount . Where are the piranhas now ? The satellites are tracking them as we speak . PING , PING , PING ... I have a visual ! I 'll put it on the front screen . BEEP , BEEP , BEEP ... Godspeed . ( PINGING ) We 'll be in prime position at any second ! They should have doubled the kilotons . Target is in optimal range in 10 seconds . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Locked on target . Fire ! BOOOOM ! PING ... PING ... Any sign of life ? Nothing yet . PING ... PING ... Jesus . GRRR ! No , no . It 's not possible ! Tell that sub to get out of there . GET OUT ! Remove yourself from the target path immediately ! I repeat ... What 'd they say ? It 's not clear , sir . Do we have a visual yet ? No , Captain . The radioactivity is obscuring all sensors . Let 's go up to the surface and see what 's going on . I 've a visual , sir ! Put it on screen ! PING ... PING ... ( LOUD CRUNCHING ) ( SCREAMS , EXPLOSION ) ( STATIC ) How long before they reach Southern Florida ? Less than an hour . Not enough time for an evacuation . I need a private line to the President . I 'll take it in my room . Right away , sir . Excuse me . Mr. Secretary ... what is it ? What are you not telling us ? I have been authorized to order a full nuclear assault . Maybe a hundred times what we just saw . Enough to disintegrate the land , everything on it and boil up all the water in and around the Florida panhandle . We just saw those things absorb that last detonation like it was nothing and move on . Well , they won 't move on from the next one . There 's got to be another way . You got a better plan ? Yeah . When I dove that river in Venezuela , I was attacked by a bunch of these things , about two feet long . I was able to cut one of them with my knife . As soon as it started to bleed , all the other fish forgot about me and attacked the thing . Tore it to pieces . What if we can make these big ones bleed like that ? Maybe they 'll turnon each other . But how ? We 're not even making 'em bleed with bombs and missiles . Very precise hits , like a surgeon . But you 'd have to go down with other divers for that , swim right alongside them . Hit ' em in the eyes or something . Exactly , right in the eyes . Me and a bunch of other divers . There 's got to be a dozen Seals here . We can do it . Let me try ... I won 't let you down . But you 'll be killed , like everyone else . It 's better than the alternative . Mr. Secretary ... Bob . Let us do it . Just give us this one last chance . Okay , Fitch . You got it . One last chance . * * This is Jane Fisher coming live from Southern Florida , where there has been a massive naval response to what they 're saying is a hurricane warning . People have been told to stay in their homes . We 'll keep you updated as we know more . Cut . Oh , my goodness . I mean , can you believe this ? It is such a beautiful day . Like there 's really gonna be a hurricane . What a dud of a story . LOUDSPEAKER : Everyone stay in your homes . A storm is approaching . Did you get that ? Get the camera back up . Do not attempt to go out on the streets ... Stay away from the beaches ... Look at the truck . Focus on the truck . Stay away . Make sure you 're getting the sound , what they 're saying . This is the MK-15 , the most powerful handheld , underwater cannon in the world . It fires 120 rounds per minute . Fully functional up to a depth of 675 feet . If you are approached , fire . If you are uncertain , fire . And if you are retreating , fire . This cartridge holds 20 mm armor piercing rounds . There 's also another cartridge that holds high-powered penetration bombs . This ammunition was designed to take down a nucular sub . So , consider yourself a good match against these fish . And that 's exactly what they are . Nothing but fish . YEAH ! YEAH ! YEAH ! I have something for you . TEAM LEADER : Next , we talk about the drop zone . What is it ? Inside , this containssix frequency amplifiers . They mimic the Serrasalmus pitch for " I found food " . Just push the button inside to fire , in case you 're trapped . The fish 'll follow the sound . Thank you . And keep in contact , okay , with the communicator . I will . TEAM LEADER : Fitch ! I got to go . TEAM LEADER : We are three clicks away from the entry point . Just follow my directions and we 'll make it through this mission in one piece , gentlemen . The giant piranha are approaching the outer Keys from the east . Let 's do it . Load ' em in . Load in , load in ! The operation is a go . I repeat , the operation is a GO . Alright , lets go , move on . Pile in , pile in ! Let 's go , go , go , go ! All the way . Pile in . No , no , next chopper , next chopper . Let 's go . Keep going . Take her up ! What 's that ? It 's a dinner bell . Radio test ... Baker . Baker here . Good test . Radio test ... Gordon . Gordon here . Good test . Radio test ... Fitch . Fitch here . Good test . Radio test ... Rodriquez . Rodriguez here . Good test . Alright everybody . T-minus three minutes until we hit the drop zone . We 're gonna get as close to the shore to attack as possible , so when we hit the water , we will be firing . Be prepared . Look down there ! Shit ! You should see what they can do with a town . You see that ? I see it . Hey , didn 't I tell you two to stay off the pier ? Shhh ! Shhh ! Think he 's got a big one this time . Bernie ! Steph ? Ohh . Heat up that frying pan , my friend , ' cause this baby 's big enough for three . Reports from South Florida . The piranhas have reached the Keys . GROWRRR ! We need those Navy Seals in the water now ! NOW , NOW ! Alright now , let 's gear up ! BOOM ! News reports are coming in from Key West . I 'll put it on the screen . This is Jane Fisher reporting to you , live from Southern Florida , where there was a recent hurricane warning . There is no hurricane . I repeat , there is no hurricane ! Instead , Florida is being attacked by giant fish . That is correct . Giant fish with teeth . They are consuming everything in their path . They just ate a boat . You can see people behind me , running away from the shore . This is absolutely monstrous ! We 're gonna try and move closer for you to get a better picture . Move in ! AHHHH ! Clear out ! We lost the feed . AHHHHH ! Alright , we 're coming to the drop zone ! Final check . Get your gear . Take some BCs and line up by the door . Let 's go ! ( MUFFLED GUNFIRE ) FITCH : There 's no blood coming out of their eyes ! Any suggestions ? TEAM LEADER : This isn 't working . We 're losing men fast , and the ammunition isn 't penetrating their scales . Fitch , are you there ? FITCH : This is Fitch . Some Serrasalmus don 't have regular blood vessels in their eyes . Try hitting them in their gills , deep inside , where there 's veins . FITCH : Copy that . We 'll hit them in the gills ! TEAM LEADER : Okay now ! Let 's move ! Let 's move ! DIVER : Fitch ! He 's to your five ! FITCH : Fire into the gills . ( MUFFLED GUNFIRE ) FITCH : Hit ' em in the gills , like she said ! ( MUFFLED GUNFIRE ) FITCH : Monroe , the gills aren 't opening . We can 't shoot them ! Fitch , Fitch ! Don 't go ! Yes Sir . That 's it . Get your men outta there . I 'm ordering the nuclear strike ! No , sir ! We can 't nuke the Florida Panhandle . Must be another option ! We tried it your way ! I 'm giving the order . You come in now ! FITCH : You know I can 't do that , sir ! There 's gotta be another way ! Fitch . Try shooting a bomb into its mouth . Its weak stomach will hemorrhage with the explosion ! Fitch , you have two minutes . FITCH : Copy that . Two minutes . FITCH : Are those choppers still topside ? GRADY : Affirmative . There 's only one chopper left up there . PILOT : I 'm putting together an explosive device right now . FITCH : Jonesy , I 'm goingto the helicopter to getsome explosives . Hold mygun and cover me . FITCH : Gordon , I 'm getting you outta here . Come with me . Stay close . TEAM LEADER : Alright , men ! Let 's give Fitch and Gordon some cover fire ! ( MUFFLED GUNFIRE ) Sir , there 's an unidentified helicopter and it 's flying toward the rescue craft . I see it . It 's coming in on starboard side . Fitch . Fitch ! Get out of there ! He can 't hear us , sir . What are they doing ? It 's just flying right next to us . Watch out ! Send two more helicopters . Fast . Yes , sir ! ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING ) You go up first . Fitch ? Jason Fitch , are you there ? We 're not getting anything from any of them , sir . I 'm sorry , Mr. Secretary , but I think we have to go to the contingency . It 's the only answer . We must make the strike before they get too far north . How many hours before they reach Washington ? Less than two , and by then , they 'll be three times the size that they are now . Get over there ! NOW ! You gotta be kidding me . There are people DYING down there . You 're dead , Cabron ! Hahaha . I 'm not kidding . BANG ! AHHH ! Gordon ! What ? Move ! Gaah ... gaah .. gaahh ! You 're fish food ! GRRR ! ( GUNFIRE ) TEAM LEADER : What the hell was that ? ! FITCH : That 's supper ! TEAM LEADER : Holy shit ! That 's awesome ! TEAM LEADER : Good to have you back ! We 're getting hammered down here ! FITCH : I think I can help . You guys wait here . Wait for my signal to shoot into the gills . ( GUNFIRE ) FITCH : Come get me son of a bitch ! ( MISSILE FIRES ) FITCH : Gotcha . ( EXPLOSION ) ( LOUD RIPPING , CHEWING ) ( LOUD RIPPING , CHEWING ) TEAM LEADER : He did it ! I can 't believe it ! It 's a feeding frenzy down here . FITCH : They 're tearing each other apart ! YEAH ! YES ! Keep going , baby . You 're doing fine ! FITCH : Everyone ! We need to get outta here before we 're next on the menu . Okay , Fitch . I want you guys out of there . Send a rescue helicopter to pick ' em up . They can pick ' em up topside . FITCH : Copy that . We 're heading up . TEAM LEADER : Alright ! Everybody topside , on the double ! FITCH : You okay , doc ? GORDON : I just got shot , and you threw me out of a helicopter . ( LAUGHING ) You 'll get over it . ( LAUGHING ) ( RIPPING , CHEWING ) * * * * ( MUSIC , NO SOUND ) Good work , Fitch ... for an analyst . ( LAUGHING ) Thank you , sir .

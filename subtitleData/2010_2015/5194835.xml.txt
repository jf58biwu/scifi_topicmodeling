 Skye : The secret is out . For decades , your organization stayed in the shadows , Hiding the truth . But now we know - - they 're among us . Heroes And monsters . The world is full of wonders . [ indistinct conversations ] Thanks , bernie . You bet . Ace , come and get it . What do you say we go out to your aunt mindy 's this weekend ? You and kisha can swim in the pond . Sure . You know , you got a birthday coming up in a couple of months . Who 's your favorite ? I 'm okay . Hey . Things are tight right now , but I 'm gonna find something . Not back at the factory , but I got prospects . You and me - - what are we ? We 're a team . [ chuckles ] that 's right . So , who do you - - [ people screaming ] [ indistinct shouting ] [ car alarms blaring ] Are you okay ? All right , ace , look at me . I need you to stay here with bernie , okay ? People might be hurt , and I 'm gonna see if they need my help . Stay with bernie . Watch my boy ! [ indistinct shouting ] Debbie : Help me ! Help me ! [ indistinct shouting ] Woman : Come on ! Come on ! [ grunting ] Come on ! Get out ! Get out ! Come on ! Man : Anybody in the building still ? ! [ grunting ] Aah ! [ coughs ] [ grunts ] [ glass shatters ] [ debbie whimpers ] Help me ! Help me ! [ grunts ] Man : Keep going . [ indistinct shouting ] [ people gasping ] [ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] [ siren wails in distance ] [ coughing ] We can 't explain everything we see . But our eyes are open . So what now ? There are no more shadows for you to hide in . Something impossible just happened . What are you going to do about it ? [ tires screech ] Agent ward , there 's been a development . It 's the rising tide . They 've pinned down the location of the package . We need to abort . I 'm five minutes away from retrieving it . So is everyone else . They posted the coordinates online . If the job was easy ... Yeah , it wouldn 't be any fun . Watch your six . [ siren wailing ] [ conversations in french ] Red tie , by the window . [ beep ] [ woman singing in french ] [ door creaks ] [ warbling ] [ beeping ] [ beep ] Your fireplace is broken . [ door closes ] [ man shouts in french ] [ groans ] [ glass shatters ] [ grunting ] Dumont : Ward , just a heads-up . We 've got possible hostiles in your vicinity . Really ? [ grunts ] [ groans ] [ breathing heavily ] Hill : What does " s.H.I.E.L.D. " stand for , agent ward ? Strategic homeland intervention , enforcement And logistics division . And what does that mean to you ? It means someone really wanted our initials To spell out " shield . " It means we 're the line ... Between the world and the much weirder world . We protect people from news they aren 't ready to hear . And when we can 't do that , we keep them safe . Something turns up Like this chitauri neural link We get to it before someone bad does . Any idea who vanchat was planning to sell it to ? I 'm more interested in how this rising tide group Found out about it . I thought they were just hackers . What changed ? Everything 's changing . A little while ago , most people went to bed Thinking that the craziest thing in the world Was a billionaire in a flying metal suit . Then aliens invaded new york and were beaten back By , among others , a giant green monster , A costumed hero from the ' 40s , and a god . I don 't think thor 's technically a god . Well , you haven 't been near his arms . The battle of new york was the end of the world . This - - now - - is the new world . People are different . They have access to tech , to formulas , Secrets they 're not ready for . Why was I pulled out of paris ? That , you 'll have to ask agent coulson . Uh , yeah . I 'm clearance level six . I know that ... Agent coulson was killed in action Before the battle of new york . Got the full report . Welcome to level seven . Sorry - - that corner was really dark , And I couldn 't help myself . I think there 's a bulb out . [ horn honks ] Director fury faked your death - - To motivate the avengers . Hill : Well , the death of a common ally Is a particularly effective team builder . Female voice : Say " cheese . " Plus , it wasn 't that much of a stretch . I stopped breathing for about 40 seconds . Eight . It gets longer every time you tell it . Yeah , well , you get shanked by the asgardian mussolini , You can tell it your way . I was looking at the big white light , And it felt like a lot longer than eight seconds . Do theknow ? The avengers - - that fury played them ? They 're not level seven . I got out of the I.C.U. , Fury stuck me in a grass shack in tahiti . Rough gig . Mai tais , travis mcgee novels , and a physical therapist Whose command of english was ... Irrelevant . But something put you back in the game . What is that ? That 's a superhero , agent ward . An unregistered gifted . Identity - - unknown . Skye : The secret 's out . For decades , your organization ... [ woman speaking french ] man : On may 2nd , an unidentified object ... Another little present from the rising tide . How are they getting this stuff before us ? Same way they cracked our rsa implementation . They 're good . So I need better . Hill : Agent coulson has requisitioned A mobile command unit , to which you are assigned . Rising tide is trying to draw us out . I think it 's time they succeeded . You want me to cross them off ? Wow . No . I want to use them to get to him . This man 's world is about to get very weird . He 's gonna need some help . I 'm sorry . I was trained from day one as a specialist . I go in alone . I get it done . Defusing a nuclear bomb - - I 'm your guy . A welcoming committee ? [ inhales sharply ] not my speed . I know it 's not what you want . Agent hill did a very detailed assessment Of your last three missions . Combat - - top grades . Espionage - - She gave you the highest marks since romanoff . Under " people skills , " she drew a - - I think it 's a little poop With knives sticking out of it . What ? It - - That 's bad , right ? And given your family history , I 'm surprised it 's not worse . But I think you 're the guy for this . Dr. Streiten : We 're meeting now . If I 'm wrong , you go straight back to your bombs . Team 's approved . Physicals are all fine . Fitz-simmons is not cleared for combat . I 'm told that won 't be an issue . Agent ward here - - he 's almost too fit . That 's an issue . That should be an issue . Maybe I can 't join the team God , are you dismissed . Because my - - [ door opens ] It was a porcupine . It was not a poop . It just means that he - - No , I 'm pretty sure . And it 's not just ward . Your whole roster is sketchy . Well , they 're cleared . I would have been very happy not to clear you , phil . I 'd love for you to rest up some more . I 've had plenty of that . Thanks . You sure ? You should go sometime . Where ? Tahiti . It 's a magical place . [ chuckles ] Three days in , I 'd be begging for an assignment . Exactly . [ door opens ] Tahiti . [ door closes ] He really doesn 't know , does he ? He can never know . I-is there any way I can thank him ? [ cash register dings ] are you sure nobody saw him ? [ horn honks ] male reporter : So , the identity of the hooded hero Still remains unknown . Female reporter : Researchers at ucla medical center Released a study today which shows that supplemental ... Just act natural . What ? Just pretend that we 're talking . We are . Good . 'cause you never know who 's listening . I don 't even know who 's talking . I 'm skye . And you 're the hooded hero . [ chuckles ] Please tell me that you 're not staying with that name . Wait . What ? I 'm not - - I 'm a factory worker . [ scoffs ] Sure , by day . I saw you . You 're a hero . Like , a for-real superhero , which is - - I 'm not , like , a groupie , stalker type , but ... [ laughs ] Oh , my god ! That is so cool ! Okay , okay , chill . Just don 't - - don 't draw attention . [ sighs ] You 're in danger . You got the wrong guy , lady . No , you 've got the wrong approach . The cute girl from the hospital is dying to thank you - - And possibly " thank " you - - [ clears throat ] And you 're hiding . The clip of you rescuing her has had the most hits Since that puppy with vertigo , And you can 't even find a job . What do you mean about danger ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Shield , what ? I should carry a shield ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Government . Scary men in dark suits who come after guys like you . They knew about the battle of new york Before it even happened And then cleaned it up Before anyone could ask any real questions - - overnight . How long do you think it 'll take for them to clean you up ? And you want to know why I 'm hiding . What if you didn 't hide ? What if you got in front of this And let people know that you 're a hero ? I 'm just a guy . Well , a guy like that gets work , gets perks . I can help . I 'm great with computers - - like , weirdly great . I mean , I could help you create a whole new identity or ... [ gasps ] A mask . O-kay . Uh , ok- - Well , you could just - - also , we could just stick with the ... [ thud ] ... Hood . Listen , you cannot walk away from this . With great power comes ... A ton of weird crap that you are not prepared to deal with . Now , my office is - - You have an office ? Yes , I have an office . It 's a mobile ... Office . It 's a ... Van . I live in a van - - by choice . But it 's always in the alley around the corner - - Free wi-fi - - and you can come by anytime . Thank you . They 're coming for you . ... Mike . Coulson : Agent may . No . So you 've been briefed . I 'm not going back in the field . Yeah . You 've got such a nice setup here . You ever thought about adding a moat ? I just need you to drive the bus , Liaise ground transpo , some on-site supervision . This isn 't a combat op . Then you don 't need me . [ stapler clicks ] I do . 'cause we 'll be running ourselves . Picking the ops ... Making the calls . No red tape . This is where they actually make the red tape , isn 't it ? I always wondered . Melinda . You 're really just asking me to drive the bus ? I 'm not asking . But it 's a really nice bus . [ indistinct conversations ] Man : You need to know ? Man # 2 : Yeah . Asap , please . [ indistinct shouting ] Man # 3 : That 's gonna be on a secondary . Man # 4 : Yeah , got it ! [ scottish accent ] whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Watch it ! That 's the night-night gun . [ british accent ] well , it 's on my stuff , and it doesn 't work , And there 's no way we 're calling it the night-night gun . The bullets work . Nonlethal , heavy stopping power , Break up under the subcutaneous tissue - - Oh , with a dose of only .1 microliters of dendrotoxin . I 'm not hermione . I can 't create instant paralysis with that . You should have run the specs by me before building the molds . The bullets are hollow . It 's a marvel I can keep them from breaking apart in the chamber . Or used a higher-caliber round . Or read a book . Have you ever heard of physics or - - What 's the other one ? - - Inertia ? It 's not particularly difficult . [ thud ] Fitz-simmons ? Fitz . Simmons . I 'm engineering . She 's biochem . Agent ward ? Coulson said I 'd need my comm receiver encoded . Don 't know if you 've worked with that model before . It 's ... [ thudding , cracking ] ... Brand-new . He 'll repurpose the I.D.I.S. Chip . Don 't need the external receiver for the inner-ear comms anymore . So , uh , how does it - - Embedded sensorineural silicone matched to your dna . It 's very posh . So , are you excited to be coming on our journey into mystery ? It 's like christmas . [ tires screech ] [ tires screech ] Fitz : One of coulson 's old s.H.I.E.L.D. Collectibles . Flamethrowers , world 's first gps . He 's mad for this crap . Don 't touch lola . And he calls it a girl 's name . [ slap ] [ chuckles ] Lola 's not just a collectible , you know . People tend to confuse the words " new " and " improved . " This mobile command , They were in heavy rotation back in the ' 90s , But then we got a heli-carrier . Hey . Did you hear the one about the guy who 's afraid of flying ? I 've done a night jump into a drop zone under heavy fire , sir . I can handle it . That was a ... Joke . The first part of a ... I 'm not gonna tell it now . May : If you plan to unpack , make it quick . Wheels are up in five . We may have a hit on one of the rising tide 's routing points . Good . We need to do some catching up . Is that ... Who I think it is ? She 's just the pilot . Melinda may is " just the pilot . " Come on , sir . What game are you really playing ? Better stow your gear . [ engines whirring ] [ radio chatter ] Skye : How will you come at us ? From the air ? From the ground ? How will you silence us this time ? How can you ? The truth is in the wind . It 's everywhere . You cannot stop the rising tide . You will not find us . You will never see our faces . But rest assured - - We will rise against those who shield us from the truth . And nothing - - nothing can stop us in the - - Hey . What up ? [ exhales sharply ] [ door closes ] You guys are making a big mistake . You don 't look that big . Coulson : Sorry for the lack of finesse . Agent ward here has had a little history with your group - - The rising tide . I don 't know ... What you 're - - Okay , there are two ways we can do this . Oh . Is one of them the easy way ? No . Oh . What 's your name ? Skye . What 's your real name ? That can wait . It 's another name we need - - a certain hero . What makes you think I know that ? Well , you made a little mistake . The phone you filmed the hooded hero with Had the same cryptographic signature As a few of the rising tide posts . Wow . Yeah . Was that a mistake ? Or am I now sitting In the center of your secret headquarters ? What is this ? A plane ? I got inside . And by now , you 've discovered You can 't beat the encryption on my equipment , So you got nothing . We have a fairly strong coincidence - - You being on the scene Right before it went up in flames . Want to tell me what my team is gonna find out ? How did you know the hooded man was in the building ? Did you blow it up to draw him out ? Did you ? That 's not our style . I was just kidnapped by your " style . " S.H.I.E.L.D. Covered up new mexico , project pegasus . Of course you 'd be covering up centipede . Holy no way . [ chuckles ] You don 't know what that is . Billions of dollars of equipment at your disposal , And I beat you with a laptop that I won in a bet ? You need to think about your friend . We 're not the only ones interested In people with powers . We 'd like to contain him , yeah . The next guy will want to exploit him , And the guy after that will want to dissect him . What is centipede ? [ sighs ] Yeah , I get it , but ... Listen , doctor , people saw me . They saw what I can do . If I went public , that might be good . I mean , your product works . It works amazingly , and - - Yeah , yeah , I-I-I know what I signed , But if we got out in front of this , maybe - - Then what ? You want me to go crawling back to the factory ? I couldn 't even get workmen 's comp from those crooks . I don 't think - - Yeah , ye- - Doctor , I just thought - - Okay . [ telephone beeps ] This was a lab . Was this leased as a lab ? Mnh-mnh . Self-empowerment center . [ chuckles ] With a top-of-the-line motion-sensor security system . Ah . So a secret lab . And a superhero . Not a coincidence . So , was this explosion sabotage ? Was it meant for him ? Or were they just in over their heads ? Yeah , working the problem . Ladies , if you 'll just - - Sorry . If you 're gonna be in the field , agent fitz , You have to get your hands dirty . [ beeping ] No , I don 't . [ whirring ] ¶ heigh-ho , off to work you go ¶ Skye : Centipede - - it was chatter on the web And then gone . I traced the access-point mac address to that building . What were you after ? The truth . What are you after ? World peace . You pseudo-anarchist hacker types love to stir things up . But you 're never around for the fallout . People keep secrets for a reason , skye . Well , just because you 're reasonable and ... Firm ... Doesn 't mean that you 're not an evil , faceless Government tool bag . Just give us your guy 's name . He 's not my guy ! You understand he 's in danger . Then let me go . Let me talk to him . Me , not the t-1000 here . You want to be alone with him . Of course . She 's a groupie . All this hacking into s.H.I.E.L.D. , tracking powers - - She might as well be one of those sweaty cosplay girls Crowding around stark tower . What ? ! I would - - It was one time . Ward . Is it the girl ? She getting under your skin ? Sir ? Or is it the assignment ? Are you so anxious to get out of this That you 'd deliberately blow an interrogation ? [ beeping ] give me a minute alone with her , you 'll have your answers . She 's an asset . She is such an a- - Wait - - " asset " ? We don 't know anything about her . Do you appreciate how often that happens ? That never happens . We need ... What she knows . See , we designed each with their own capabilities , So , um , some recording The dimensions and textures of the room , And then some testing the matter density , radiation . I mean , one is basically just smelling . Fitz : Whoa , whoa , whoa . I 've got something in something . Who 's got it ? Uh ... Bashful . Aww . Surveillance camera . Deep-fried . Yes , but that model Has flash memory in case of brownouts . [ clang ] Now , I could sync that with data from the motion detectors And , with a little luck , Get some images from before the blast . And by " luck , " I mean " unappreciated genius . " Yeah , we 'll need it . Snow 's reading some compounds that are - - Whoa . My god . Explosive ? Not of this earth . This is qnb-t16 . It 's the top-shelf martini of sodium pentothal derivatives . It 's a brand-new and extremely potent truth drug . Don 't worry . The effects only last about an hour . And you 'll have a nice little nap . And we 'll have all the answers to our - - Hey ! What the hell ? ! I 'm sorry . Did that hurt ? No . But you 've lost your mind . You should never do that to a member of your team . And , yes , it did hurt a little bit . But I always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women 'cause I think it makes me seem more masculine . My god , this stuff works fast . Don 't trust us ? Ask him whatever you 'd like . Wait a minute . Wait . You can 't just - - [ door opens ] This is definitely not protoco- - You seem nervous , agent ward . I 'm calling to mind my training . There 's no way I 'm gonna reveal classified secrets To a girl who 's hell-bent on taking us down . Have you ever killed anyone ? Yes , a few . High-risk targets . But they were terrible people ... Who were trying to murder nice people . And I didn 't feel good afterwards . And does your grandmother know about these things ? [ voice breaking ] gramzy ? [ indistinct shouting ] my hands are tied , mike . It 's company policy . You didn 't meet quota . I had to let you go . Gary , look , I got no choice . It 's just me and my boy now . There 's no openings , mike , and even if there were , I got a hundred guys standing in line that are just like you , Only they won 't bitch when their back hurts . I was injured , but I 'm stronger now . I can handle twice the load I used to . What are you not hearing ? You don 't cut it . When I say I need things moved , I need - - [ grunts ] Man : Oh , hey ! Hey ! Like that ? Are you out of your mind ? ! Ohh ! Heads up ! These are people , gary . Men ! Not parts you replace when they break . [ shakily ] it 's not me , man . It 's the company . I 'm not the bad guy . I 'm not the bad guy , man . Yes , you are . It 's simple now , just like we used to read about . You 're the bad guy . [ grunts ] And I 'm the hero . Coulson : Did agent ward give you anything ? He told me he 's been to paris , but he 's never really seen it And that he wishes you had stayed in tahiti . It 's a magical place . Ward doesn 't like your style . Kind of think I do . What about his ? ... Remains in critical condition . Employees could not identify the attacker , But security footage confirms That this man assaulted the factory foreman Before damaging thousands of dollars ' worth Of company property . This is wrong . This is not ... The guy I met . He was With us here on kzqm25 . He just needs a break . Then give him one . What have you got ? [ beeping ] Coulson : Michael peterson - - Factory worker , married , one kid . Gets injured , gets laid off . Wife jumps ship . Good guy , bad breaks . Best guess is , somebody tells him They can make him strong again , make him super . Who has the tech to do that ? And why would they want to ? Fitz , what do we have from the security footage Before the blast ? [ beeping ] What are we seeing ? Well , the man is angry at the other man . The data is very corrupt . Yeah , like cold war russia corrupt . Yeah . I-I can 't sync the timecode without - - What if you had the audio ? I was ... Running surveillance on the lab . I had my shotgun mic pointed at the window before the blast . The digital file 's in my van . There 's too much background noise for me , But ycould probably - - you can clean that up , can 't you ? Find a sync point and use cross-field validation To find - - but I can 't scrub for expression patterns When the vit-c is all - - well , is there a chrominance subcarrier ? Yeah , attached to the back porch . Brilliant . Um , that audio would be great . Thank you very , very much . We will take that audio , please . Your van 's here , but you were right - - We couldn 't decrypt the files . The encryption 's coupled to the gps . Get my van back to that alley , and then I 'm in business . Agent may will escort you . And on your way out , wake up ward . Woman on p.A. : Volunteer services to oncology 1 . Volunteer services to oncology 1 . You 're ... Oh , wow . You 're ... Him . [ chuckles ] I 'm glad you 're doing okay . Oh , yeah . Thank you . They 're beautiful . [ door closes ] What the hell are you doing here ? I don 't know where to go , doctor . Everything 's getting ... I-I know what 's right . I do . But no one will listen to me . I volunteered because you said things would change . And ... You said you could keep it together . Our first subject lost it - - Walked into the lab with a fricking bomb . I 'm not like him . Well , tell that to your foreman in the I.C.U. I saved you . You exposed me ! [ sighs ] You exposed the program . [ exhales sharply ] The people who gave me this technology - - They are very serious , And they do not want to be revealed . Mike peterson needs to disappear . You 're right . I 'm not him anymore . I 'm someone else now . Oh , please . You 're juiced , mike . And you 're losing it , just like the last guy . [ sighs ] This is a disaster . No . It 's an origin story . Audio file should be coming through . It 's not compressed , so it might take a minute . Uh , yeah . [ beeping ] Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm getting it . [ keyboard clacking ] So , uh , uh , when - - when you get back , I 'll show you my thing . A thing . It 's not - - I-it 's my hardware . My equipment . Let 's ... Hang up . So , the alien metal wasn 't the explosive ? Well , I assumed from the break pattern And dispersion that it was , But it 's just dripping with gamma radiation and - - Oh ! Now it 's actually dripping . [ chuckles ] Fun . So , what did that get us ? Skye 's sending us the rest of her decrypted files on centipede . But we have her audio . I 've loaded it up . Nice work . [ keyboard clacking ] now , using motion estimation , Bayesian inference , a beam splitter , And a little diffraction theory , Our mystery man ... Appears . It 's like magic . But it 's - - it 's science . Ward : Explosives in the case ? ... To please calm down . Just let me check your vitals . I feel fine . I want to feel more . Where 's the doctor ? Where is she ? ! I-if you don 't settle down , I-I 'll have you sedated . Where is she ? ! Wait . Did you - - did you see that on his arm ? [ beeping , rewinding ] Coulson : What does that look like to you ? A centipede . It 's an intravenous filter for his blood . This goo , sir - - very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine developed in the ' 40s for the ... Super soldiers . I 'm reading alien metal , gamma radiation , the serum - - Every known source of superpower thrown in a blender . We need to see the origin of the blast . Run it back from the last point recorded . [ beeping ] That should do it . Let 's head back . All right , let me just - - [ grunting ] Mike . What are you doing ? Saving you . From the scary men in dark suits . And you 're gonna help save us . " us " ? [ whimpers ] Don 't cry . Okay ? Stay strong for me , ace . What are we ? We 're a team . That 's right . Now drive . Extremis . It 's new . Completely unstable . Poor man didn 't bring an explosive . And mike has the same stuff in his system . And judging by his strength level , a lot more . So any minute now , mike is gonna - - He 'll take out anyone within a two-block radius . Well ... You wanted a bomb . Simmons : Sir ? He didn 't explode because he was angry . The two are connected . It - - it 's kind of a chemical surge . But calming him down will buy him a minute at most . He will detonate within the next few hours . Solution ? Isolate him , get him away from people . Or ? Put a bullet through his brain . If he 's dead , this irradiated metabolic process will stop . We need to come up with a third option - - One that doesn 't involve mike 's son losing a father . We have a couple of hours at most . There 's no way that we could possibly - - Don 't ever tell me there 's no way ! It 's on you . Get it done . [ beeping ] May ? He took skye . You all right ? We 'll deal with that later - - at length . Right now , we need to figure out where they went . [ indistinct conversations ] [ keyboard clacking ] [ beeping ] How long is this gonna take ? This is top speed . Trust me . It 's not like I 'm deleting a facebook page . I 'm bypassing the license bureau 's A.E.S.-Protected data stream . So chill . How do I know you can really do this ? I 've done it before . [ beep ] Come on . Give me more paralysis . [ beeping ] less rigor mortis ! Oh , come on ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Just pretend it 's an exam . We 're taking an exam . An exam - - yeah . Yeah . Okay . I don 't want an " f . " " f " equals a massacre . [ breathing heavily ] [ computer beeping ] Whoa . Oh , no ! What is this nonsense ? Why are you making nonsense ? ! This isn 't me ! It 's noise . Someone 's hacking our secure channel . It 's longitude and latitude . Mike took skye . [ engine turns over ] She 's telling us where . [ beeping ] Mike : We 'll take the nice lady with us . We - - we - - we can 't go to the airport , So we 'll - - we 'll take a train . And there , she 'll - - she 'll help us start over , Make a new life - - A better life , like I always said . [ indistinct conversations ] Look at this place . You 're gonna risk thousands of lives over some nobody . Nobody 's nobody , ward . Fitz-simmons will come through . [ amplifier beeps ] mr . Peterson , good morning . We 're not a threat . We 're here to help . But you 're in danger , and we need to take you in . What did you do ? ! [ police radio chatter ] [ grunts ] Man : Whoa ! Get down ! [ people screaming ] Come on . Come on . Woman on p.A. : Please return to check-in counter . [ speaking spanish ] [ indistinct conversations ] Yeah , we won 't . [ groans ] You 're right - - he is a little bitch . Yo , get him ! Get him ! Ace , get back ! Get out the way , man ! Come on ! Come on , now ! [ screams ] [ bones crack ] aah ! Ace ! [ clang ] [ screams ] Man : Tell dispatch we 'll need backup ! [ siren wailing ] Man # 2 : I don 't know . Just go . Just keep going to the other side . [ indistinct shouting ] [ engine turns over ] you need to get inside . Hey . Let 's get him out of here . I want my daddy . I promise . Woman : Come on , honey . Ace ! Ace ! Ohh ! [ chokes ] Look - - the stuff inside you is unstable . It 'll kill you and everyone in here . Who 's gonna miss us ? ! [ groans ] [ police radio chatter ] [ indistinct shouting ] [ people screaming ] [ alarm ringing ] Man : Come on ! Get inside ! [ siren wails ] We 're at the north entrance , may . You told them to hold fire . I don 't think that 's us . We may have a third party here . He 's gonna head down to the tracks . You stay high . I 'll go low . Only take the shot if you have to , ward . Ward ! If I have to . [ train whistle blows ] [ breathing heavily ] You got to stop ! These people can help you . The men in suits ? They 're your buddies now ? Where did they take my son ? ! [ police radio chatter ] Get down ! [ gun cocks ] [ grunts ] [ gun cocks ] Ohh ! [ grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] Think that means anything ? I know you got men everywhere waiting to put me down . I know how this plays out . I don 't . I know you got poison in your system . I know it 's burning you up . Mike , the last guy who wore that exploded . I 'm not like that other guy . I 'm - - It matters who I am - - inside , if I 'm a good person , If I 'm strong . I have a clear shot . Do you copy ? I know you 're strong . Your boy knows it . He needs you to let us help . You took him ! [ voice breaking ] you took my wife , my job , my house . You think this is killing me ? ! All over , there 's people being pushed down , being robbed . One of them tries to stand up , You got to make an example out of him . You bring this building down on us , will that help them ? That 's a lie ! All you do is lie ! You said if we worked hard ... If we did right We 'd have a place . You said it was enough to be a man . But there 's better than man . There 's gods . And the rest of us ... What are we ? They 're giants . We 're what they step on . I know . I 've seen giants - - up close . And that privilege cost me ... Nearly everything . But the good ones ... The real deal - - They 're not heroes because of what they have that we don 't . It 's what they do with it . You 're right , mike . It matters who you are . I could , you know ? Be a hero . I 'm counting on it . [ silenced gunshot ] Coulson : Subject is in stable condition . All clear at union station .

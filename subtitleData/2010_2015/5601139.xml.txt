 Yes , I 'm listening , bastard . My name is not " Nem " , it is " Nam " . Namgoong Minsoo , you shit . Namgoong is my name , my surname is Minsoo , asshole . For what ? If I don 't want to ? You 'd like a puff wouldn 't you , asshole ? It 's too good for shit like you . Get up . My daughter , Yona . To move forward , we need her . For each door , I want two blocks of Kronol . I 'm stalling ? It 's my fault ? Of course , I do it for the Kronol . You 're the one who 's giving me this . Stop ! We 're getting closer . What are you waiting for ? Run . Sure . Don 't look . You can eat this too ? A train baby wouldn 't know about this . I grew up walking over it . This is located under the snow . Of the earth . What is this ? It moves . Underground . What does this mean ? Look , you see that ? What ? You see that woman before ? She was a maid in the front car . An Inuit . An Eskimo , actually . She knew all about the ice and snow . She believed she could survive outside . Quickly ! It 's happened . Take this . Kronol first ! Are you looking for some trouble or something ? You got a problem with the gates ? Here , have a cigarette . You should be greatful . That 's the world 's last cigarette . You tail section hick . It is a beautiful story , Curtis . But I do not want to open that door . You know what I want ? I want to open a door . But not this one . That one . The one that leads to the outside . We 've been sentenced for 18 years . Everyone thinks it 's a wall . But it 's a fucking door . Open it and get us out of here . I know ... But maybe we can survive . Remember the Bridge of Yekaterina ? When we massacred then with axes . Every New Year I check something . We see the wreckage of a plane . Under the snow . For 10 years ... Its tail barely visible . But now I can see the fuselage and wings . There is less and less snow and ice . It 's melting . The snow is thining . Not long before it all goes . Recently , you know what I saw ? Outside , there were ... Rain drops . I 'm wasting my breath telling you this . You don 't think I 'm right . Kronol is ... highly combustable . A spark and boom ! Basically , it 's a fucking bomb . I not only store these to get high , but to blow that door . Matches , quickly . Give it to me ! Fire ! Blood ! Are you okay ? What ? What happened ? Get down . Yona . We must open this door . You see those cables ? There are many . Die ! Bastard ! Yona . Red , number 8 . No , 7 . Yona , the Kronol ! - Yona , stop ! - No . Stick the Kronol on the door . It 's done ! Curtis has the matches . Get the matches ! Light the fuse ! Dad ! Dad ... ? Curtis ? Stay here .

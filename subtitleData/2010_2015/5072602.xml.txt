 Previously , on Warehouse 13 ... I have cancer . ( CRYING ) PARACELSUS : Be good and quiet . And I 'll make you mortal again . You took everything from me . Now I 'll take something from you . ( GUNSHOT ) SUTTON : No ! Look after our son . This is the Eldunari , the Warehouse 's central nervous system . Something 's tearing apart the Warehouse from within its heart . Two Caretakers vying for the Warehouse . Paracelsus was Caretaker . Of Warehouse 9 . And as he gains strength , I am ... I will ... ( GASPING ) I spoke to Mr. Kosan . Paracelsus has to be taken alive . - Alive ? - Yes , in the state that Mrs. Frederic is in , if he dies suddenly , it could cause a rupture in her psyche . He has to be captured . He has to be bronzed . And that 's how we can transfer the Caretakership back to her . Well how is she ? Worse and worse by the hour . Dr. Abigail 's with her , but her memory 's failing ... She 's ... ( SIGHS ) Fading . So then what ? Paracelsus just takes over ? Claud , come on , you 're the future Caretaker , right ? Feel anything about him ? I don 't know , like where he is ? Nada , no , I guess I 'm still in training , but I will find this guy , that bitch put me in bronze . I have a score to settle . Well , thanks to Joshua 's blood sample , you have the chance . Yeah , how was Josh by the way ? Did he faint when you took the blood , because when it comes to needles , he 's so not butch . Yeah , no , he was pretty queasy ... Look , can we please focus on stopping Paracelsus , getting Mrs. Frederic better . Steve , I want you to go prep the bronzer . Pete , you and Myka go and dig through whatever we 've got on Paracelsus . Copy that . ( BEEPS ) I think I should see him , could he ... Yes , yes . That would be perfect . I will call you back . We should hang a bell around your neck . Yeah , but then I couldn 't sneak up on you , and ask what 's up with all the hushy-hush . I made an appointment with my oncologist . Happy ? Yeah , as long as you keep it . No ditching , no " getting busy . " Yes , Dad . Oh , my God , I liked you better as your usual annoying 12-year-old self . No , I just wanna make sure you take care of this , we don 't need any more surprises . ( KISSES ) Respectfully , I decline . Doctor , is there something in my tone indicating I was offering a suggestion ? You 're asking me to run , that is not how I do things . I want the Keeper to go somewhere where she and her secrets are secure . I made you a promise , Leena , and I won 't let you ... ( MRS. FREDERIC 'S VOICE MURMURING ) Leena , Leena , Leena ... I beg your pardon , Doctor . Irene . Come with me to the BB . I belong with my Warehouse . But you ... You carry the most valuable information . It must be protected . ARTIE : She 's right , Doctor . You have to go somewhere safe . How 's she doing ? She is fine and is also still in the room . More or less . But I ... ( SIGHS ) I don 't know how much longer I have , Arthur . I 'm gonna find away to sever Paracelsus from the Warehouse . The previous Caretaker has precedence . - Removing him is nearly impossible . - I love a good challenge . You ! You have to go right now . Irene , be careful . I 've already lost enough people I care about . I 'll see what I can do . Was there something in my tone which may have indicated I was offering a suggestion ? Here , here , here ! That 's a lot of here 's ! I like that , means there 's something here . I found us a ping , or more accurately three pings . - San Francisco City Hospital . - That 's one . Patients and doctors reported seeing a , quote , " Strange and beautiful golden light . " We love strange and beautiful . Well then you 'll want to marry this . That light was emanating from a copper bowl being carried by a man , a man fitting the description of one Para-freaking-celsus . Why San Francisco ? That 's unclear , but we got the same report from three San Fran hospitals . What about the patients exposed to light ? Are they all dead ? I mean , is Paracelsus racking up his death count like before ? No deaths reported , but a lot of patients affected . - Okay , so , I guess we should ... - I 'll call you when I get there . ( MOUTHING ) - Yeah , hi , what are you doing ? - You have a doctor 's appointment . Later this week , what am I supposed to do till then , play fetch with Trailer ? Myka ... Pete , look , if anything happens we 'll be in a hospital , right ? ( SIGHS ) The first sign of trouble ... Oh , God . ( SIGHING ) Nick . Nicholas . I know your mother was the only real parent that you ever had . I know that . - I wish ... - What ? You wished what ? Paracelsus should have killed me , not her . Yes , he should have . We had no idea he was a mass murderer . You never said anything . Six hundred people died to make us immortal . - So , yes , it should have been you . - We make choices in life ... Save your platitudes , I 'm not 15 . And I 'm not your problem . That 's not true . I 'm still your father ... No , you 're not . I don 't have a father . Fathers think of something besides their own interest . You 've never done a thing for us , but she was there . She was the only person in 500 years who was always there , and now I 'm completely alone . The man carried a bowl with him , um , copper . Had an Egyptian ankh on it . He only came here , to the terminal ward . So he sought out dying patients . DR. TRACHTENBERG : Yes , well , this is the only wing he visited . MYKA : ( WHISPERING ) Pete ! Why didn 't you do something ? MYKA : Pete ! What ? What ? What ? What ? Dr. Trachtenberg 's examined all the patients exposed to the light . - Yeah ? And they 're all getting worse ? - No . The two patients in this room are both in Stage IV lung cancer . This is Maggie and this is Lucy . They 're in complete remission . Oh , my God , Mykes , he cured them . [ Mysterious music ] ♪ ♪ 4x20 The Truth Hurts PETE : Okay , okay , so what are we thinking ? Huh ? I mean , is it possible ? I mean , is Paracelsus ... I mean , is this part of his plan ? To cure people ? He killed Charlotte . I know , I know . Yes , yes , he did . Also a bunch of villagers 500 years ago . But , Mykes , they 're cured . I mean , what the hell ? I just ... ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) So badly , I just wanna believe ... I do too . A lot . But I 'm afraid we just don 't know his endgame yet . DR. TRACHTENBERG : Excuse me . Maggie spoke with the man . Maggie , hi . This is Agent Lattimer and I 'm Agent Bering . - Hello . - What did the man say ? Well , I asked him what he was doing . I was scared at first but he told me not to be . He said he could see my cancer . In my eyes . And that I would be a part of helping people . He said it would all be clear once he got to the place where the air had yielded to stone . Before I could ask , he 'd already gone to another room . Cryptic . ( CHUCKLES ) Great . We love cryptic . Can you describe the copper bowl ? Only that light came out of it . Golden light . It was beautiful . He took away all that pain . ( CHUCKLES ) Maggie , thank you . ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) Okay , so the stone , right ? It 's gotta be the Philosopher 's Stone right ? Right , and the air could represent breathing or life , like a metaphor . Oh , metaphors . Worse than a cryptic . CLAUDIA : Looks like he struck again , St. Christopher 's Medical Center . Okay , we 're on it . Nothing yet on where the air has yielded to stone , I 'm still searching . We think it might be a metaphor . ( SIGHS ) I 'm so tired of metaphors . Right ? That 's what I 'm saying . I 'll find something . You find him . Steve 's getting the bronzer ready for our returning guests , but just in case ... What do you think ... Oh , my God , why do you have that ? - Don 't panic . - That 's what Dr. Vanessa was going to use to transfer the Caretaker connection from Mrs. Frederic to me . - Is she that sick ? - See , this resembles panicking . - I won 't put it on . - It 's not for you . Whew ! Okay , good , proceed with the ' splaining please . Do you mind ? Thank you . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Ah , now I can tell you . Mrs. Frederic is getting worse , so we 've had to get inventive . This ribbon , it disconnects Caretakers ... So maybe use it to disconnect Paracelsus , but he 's not here . That 's the inventive part . We are gonna send the power of this ribbon through the Farnsworth . You can do that ? The Farnsworth is more than just an oversized iPhone , you know , yes . I 'm gonna send to ... Possibly . - You have something to do besides look doubtful ? - You know , I ... Thank you . So he did the same thing here , why ? If Paracelsus needed sick people why not get them in Istanbul ? Why come all the way to California ? I don 't know , nothing connects the hospitals , two county , two private . One was elder care and the other , ER , only the most seriously injured and then the ... - Cancer ward - Huh ? - You can say the word " cancer . " - I know . I can say it . You know , cancer , cancer , cancer ! That was a little loud , are you all right ? Okay , look , I know that you 're worried . Whoa ... ( CHUCKLES ) No , no , no . I am not worried , okay ? I 'm actually the opposite of worried , I am un-worried because you are going to see your doctor this week . And who told me that ? Oh , that 's right , you did . Excuse me , ma 'am . You need to ... - Hi . - Hi . Sorry , you asked me to review the security video and let you know which door the gentleman left from ? - Mmm-hmm . - We can 't find any video of him leaving . Our best guess is that the guy is still in the building . We locked down all the exits . PETE : So I asked myself ... What could possibly make a creepy basement even creepier ? ( DOOR SLAMS ) I know . It could also be a morgue . Yippee ! This is the last place that Paracelsus was spotted , so ... PARACELSUS : Leave me alone . PETE : All right , all right , all right you big ancient freak , give it up . You 're done here . PARACELSUS : I 'm healing . Is that a crime in this century ? No , but killing Charlotte and almost killing Claudia was . Whatever it is that you 're planning ... PARACELSUS : I 'm planning scientific progress . Okay , fine . Fine , explain it to us then . PARACELSUS : You really wouldn 't understand . Oh ! No , no , no . We love it when air yields to stone . ( PARACELSUS CHUCKLES ) PETE : ( WHISPERING ) Myka , icebox . PARACELSUS : Are you so afraid of someone trying to do good ? You 're not capable of good . You killed 600 people , remember ? PARACELSUS : Come on . How many gave their lives in search of the New World ? Progress always requires sacrifice . Sorry , lady . PARACELSUS : How many lives were lost in man 's pursuit of flight ? In his exploration of space ... So you are gonna keep killing . ( WHISPERING ) Pete ! PETE : Took out the camera . PARACELSUS : Who knows , you might find yourself surprised at what I 'm going to do for mankind . He 's using an artifact to throw his voice . PARACELSUS : Oh , brava , Agent Bering . Now please let me finish my work . There 's no need that your lives be sacrificed for this great achievement . You know what ? Let me tell you something . I am tired of listening to this pile of bull ... ( GROANS ) PARACELSUS : But make no mistake . I will sacrifice you if I must . CLAUDIA : Where 's your father ? I need to ask him some Paracelsus questions . Don 't know , don 't care . - Maybe this time he 's gone for good . - Oh . So you 're gonna go with snotty . Well , that 's an interesting choice . Artie suggested the two of you might be helpful , but now I 'm beginning to think he oversold you . Sutton was just trying to protect you , you can 't be mad at the guy forever . Oh , can 't I ? Just watch me . Well , you don 't have forever anymore , do you , Nick ? You got what you wanted , you 're gonna grow up . And part of growing up , means you ... Oh , please stop . I am 500 years old , when are people gonna stop talking to me like I 'm a child ? When you stop acting like one . Geez , you wanna complain to me about your father not thinking things through ? You ? The guy whose plan involved turning me into some kind of crumbly bronze art ? I forgive you , by the way . That 's what adults do . I know you didn 't mean for me to get hurt . You were just doing the best you could with the information you had . So you 're saying I 'm just like him ? I 'm saying you have a pretty nice view from your glass house over there . Can we just ... I need help . What can you tell me about this phrase , " The air has yielded to stone . " I 've no idea . I know it 's part of your uncle 's plan , I just can 't ... Tell me what the immortalization process was like . I don 't remember much . It was awful . It was a cold , wet dungeon . The air was stale , even the wood was twisted and strange . Wood ? Wait , I thought it was underground , rock and stone Why would there be wood ? I don 't know . But the room he had Mother and me chained to was covered with it . It was all shiny and polished . It felt like stone , cold and hard . Petrified wood ? He 'd have to go through a lot of trouble to put petrified wood in an underground lab . Okay , here 's what the quotation means . - Could I ? - No . Petrified wood is formed when plant matter is buried , is cut off from oxygen ... - That would be the air . - That would be the air . When oxygen is cut off , what that does is prevent decay . So , when water flows through it ... Water , which contains minerals . Those minerals deposit themselves in the plant cells - eventually forming a stone mold . - ( MUTTERING ) So in cryptic speak , petrified wood is formed when ... " Air yields to stone . " ( LAUGHS ) I wish I could go back and retake some of those science tests I flunked . - Paracelsus ... - Paracelsus needs petrified wood for the immortalization process . And apparently a lot of it . Because his lab was destroyed he needs to go somewhere else to find it . Yeah , but why stay in San Francisco , he can find petrified wood anywhere . No , no , no , no , no , no . - Only in one specific area in Western Turkey ... - Eastern . Eastern Turkey right near the mouth of Euphrates River . So it 's region-specific , the artifact needs that specific wood in order to work . Right , unforts for Parry , that area is now way overdeveloped . But 100 years ago , a bunch of it was sent somewhere else ... A certain city by the bay . Meet Lillie Hitchcock Coit . Wait , wait , wait . My dad told me about her . She was a big supporter of the firemen , and the benefactor of Coit Tower . - I actually knew that , too . - Maybe , but I said it first , so ... What most people do not know ... Is that the tower was built with a hidden inner wall made of ... BOTH : Petrified wood . From the Euphrates River region . Yeah , Coit liked the symbolism of wood that could survive a battle with fire , much like firefighters do . So we gotta get there before Paracelsus does . Here 's how you 're gonna get him . This is a scanning disk . It was first used by John Logie Baird in 1926 . It was the world 's first demonstration of the live transmission of moving images . So we 're gonna show him a movie ? No . What we 're gonna do is , we 're gonna use a Tesla to blast the energy of this ribbon through our Farnsworth and transmit it to your Farnsworth , directly at Paracelsus ... - Ooh , so we 're gonna take him down by remote . - Exactly . And that should disconnect him from our Warehouse . Why don 't we just capture Paracelsus , bring him back to the Warehouse ... There 's no time . Mrs. Frederic is going fast , and she may not last till you get here . Okay . Okay , so we take him down by Tesla . We use the ribbon to disconnect him from the Warehouse . Don 't worry , Artie , we got this . PETE : Okay , how far are we gonna let him go ? Artie ? He 's starting the process . Pete , you get ready to take him down . This is for Charlotte ! Sutton , no ! ( GROANS ) What the hell is going on ? ( GROANS ) Artie , Artie , shoot now ! Do it ! ( GROANS ) Aah ! MRS. FREDERIC : Arthur . Why have you allowed a civilian in the Warehouse ? Mrs. Frederic ? Mykes , hey , are you okay ? ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) - ( SIGHS ) - Mrs. F ! ( GASPS ) Pete , what 's wrong ? Are you getting a vibe ? ( MONITOR ALARMS BEEPING ) WOMAN : Patient 's flatlining . MAN : Epinephrine , stat ! Bring the cart . ( MEDICAL STAFF SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) No ! Stop ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GROANS ) ( PARACELSUS LAUGHS ) Too late , Agent Lattimer . ( CHUCKLES ) So ... Maggie and all those patients who got well , they 're all dead . Just like Istanbul . Progress demands sacrifice . I 'm Paracelsus . And I shall live forever . I got this , Mykes . Claud , track me ! Yeah , I 'm tracking you . Sutton ! He could have killed me , actually killed me ! - Yes . - Mortality is awful . What are you doing here ? I had to prove to Nick , to myself , that I deserved it . Sutton , listen to me , okay ? You have to be careful , - you 're not indestructible anymore . - Oh , it 's not so bad ... - Ow ! My shoulder , it 's not healing . - Oh , my God ! And it really hurts . - I was right the first time , this is dreadful ! - Come on . Look out ! Look out ! MAN : Hey , watch it ! Shooting 's not gonna stop him , trust me . If he gets to the wharf you 'll lose him for sure . Claud , I think I got an idea . Great idea , Pete , I 'm all over it . Idea ? What idea ? He 's got an idea ? He 's a smart boy when he 's not thinking about cookies or boobies . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Yeah , you may be immortal , but you can 't fly , can you ? Nope , no super powers . ( HANDCUFFS CLINKING ) And now you 're finished . - I 'll be alive long after you 've gone . - Yeah . As a statue . Maybe we 'll put you in a park . Let 's go . The pharaoh 's copper bowl tethered him to those sick people and then , using the Stone , he siphoned off their life force . PARACELSUS : We can learn to do this with fewer deaths . Possibly none at all . But think of the benefits to mankind . Why sick people ? Weakened immune systems . Easier to draw from . Hundreds of innocent people . Look , we know that you have a larger plan . So what exactly are you after ? I can see you . You know , actually , shut up . - Let 's bronze him already . - Yeah . My sentiments exactly . He can be Warehouse 27 's problem . ( BEEPING ) PETE : And ... He 's not bronzed . I developed the bronzing process , you think I don 't know which chemicals to ingest to prevent it ? Can 't we just lock him up ? No , the Warehouse will still see him as a Caretaker . The Regents will know what to do with him . No , 500 years in one prison is enough , I will not endure ... I think I said , " shut up . " So he 's immortal , so what ? How about beheading ? Or burning alive . Oh ! Or we chop him into tiny little bits , huh ? Let 's experiment . No , we have to transfer his connection back to Mrs. Frederic , - and we can 't bronze him . - What about the ribbon ? No , no it 's too weak . At least , it 's not enough for someone as strong as he is right now . Have you considered that I might be of more benefit to the Warehouse as Caretaker than this Mrs. Frederic ? Tiny little bits . You know what ? Till the Regents get here ... Let 's put him in the Suspension Chamber . Oh ! What is wrong with you , Father ? ( GROANS IN PAIN ) It was a stupid risk , stupid . But you told me if was my fault . I know , but ... I only told you it was your fault because I was afraid you 'd tell me it was mine . I let Paracelsus out , and if it wasn 't for me then ... - Mother would still be alive ... - No , I 'm respon ... Ow ! I 'm responsible . I should have stopped him a long time ago . And I should have told you both the truth . Nick ... I know I can 't take your mum 's place , but as long as I draw breath , you 'll never be alone . Okay , let 's give it a try . Dad ... - Father ? - Yeah , " Father . " Definitely " Father . " The sooner you leave , the sooner that you can start your new lives . Yes , could you speak to the Regents ? They named me Ned . Hating that . That 's karma for all those back taxes . You know , I 'm proud of you , Sutton . All Charlotte wanted was to keep her family together , and you 're making that happen . It 's what I would want . SUTTON : You 're not so bad yourself . Doing all this just to keep the world safe . ( SIGHS ) Not everyone would . Yeah , you have to be a little impressed . I am . A little impressed . Bye . Stay in touch . - Or not . - ( CHUCKLES ) All right , so you gonna tell me ? You know sometimes your vibes are very annoying ? I know . I talked to my doctor , and he 's concerned about some pain . Okay , so ... You 've been having pain ? He wants to do the surgery today . - ( SCOFFS ) Today ? - Yeah , just in case , you know . In case of what ? They remove the mass to biopsy it . And they can see if the cancer has , you know ... Spread . It 's a good thing . You know , the surgery will tell us how bad this is , and then I can start to fight it . - Okay , I 'm gonna go with you . - What ? No . No . No , I ... ( STUTTERS ) Pete , I don 't want anyone there , so I will just call you ... Myka , I don 't want you to leave me . Okay ? I just , I ... I got a thing about that and I ... ( SOBS ) I know you do . I know . ( KISSES ) Look , I am not going anywhere . ARTIE : Hey ! I could use a little help in here . When you 're ... When you 're done . We 're almost done . I just , I have a ... I have a thing to do . Yeah , you do your ... I 'll be ... Okay , okay . Pete ... Everything is going to be fine . ( SNIFFLING ) It 's okay . I 'm fine . Okay . - Everything 's going to be fine . - Okay . ( SOBBING ) PETE : Hey , Artie . How 's Mrs. F ? ( SIGHS ) Well , her memory 's almost gone . Well , the Regents are working on a solution , but so far ... Nothing . And I have run out of ideas . Paracelsus is the only one that knows anything about this . ARTIE : Well , he 's not talking . Yeah , well , you know , Artie , there 's a lot of things I can 't do anything about . - But I can do something about this . - Wait , wait , wait ... - What are you gonna do ? - I 'm gonna find out what he knows . Trust me . I 'm feeling very persuasive . Artie , hey . - We need to talk . - No . No . We don 't need to talk . You need to go . You didn 't see Joshua . Yeah . No , I spoke with his office at CERN , he 's been there for weeks now . If whatever you did has Claudia still in danger .. Steve , don 't worry about it . Claudia is fine . If you didn 't use family DNA , then what ... Stop . You don 't understand , okay ? The DNA is fine . I 'm protecting her . You can still protect her if you tell her the truth . It may be even safer . If she knows , she can be prepared for it . Prepared for what ? What truth ? I 'll be gone soon . ( SIGHS ) If she becomes the Caretaker , she 'll find out anyway . It 'll be best if you told her . ( SIGHS ) No , no . What if she 's not ready ? I believe Miss Donovan would say she was born ready . She was , wasn 't she ? ( SIGHS ) Okay . All right . My God . I ... I 'll tell her . WOMAN 'S VOICE : It 's okay , Artie . ( SIGHS ) PETE : You know , if it were up to me , we wouldn 't be talking . But you tell me how to save Mrs. Frederic , and I 'll make sure that you get handed over to the Regents in one piece . I have no idea how to save her . No , I think you do . I know you 're upset , it can 't be easy with your friend dying . Mrs. Frederic is more than a friend , pal . - She ... - No , no , not her . What is it ... The young one ... Myka . She 's very , very ill . You didn 't know ? Myka is dying . No . No . You ... You 're wrong . Myka ... Myka 's going to be fine ... Er ... She 's ... Having the surgery and they 'll take out the cancer . No , it has spread . Far beyond whatever they can remove . Oh , please , how could you possibly know that ? Her eyes . I saw it in her eyes . He said he could see my cancer . In my eyes . Spots on the iris . They can reveal things about someone 's health . But you know this . You know she 's been lying . You felt it . She 's going to die . Now I suppose you can help her . This is the Warehouse . There are things here that can help . Sorry , pal , but we don 't use the artifacts . Oh , if I was to tell you which artifacts can help her , you would seriously do nothing ? You would let them sit on the shelf , rather than saving her life ? Hey . You wanted to see me ? Hey , yeah . Um ... Listen , there 's something we should discuss . Oh , boy . I know that tone . Uh , Artie , I 'm not ready to talk about being Caretaker ... - Oh , no , no ... - We 're gonna find a way to save Mrs. Frederic ... Claudia , it 's about something else - you may not want to hear ... - The Regents are gonna ... Would you please listen to me ! The DNA ... That slowed down the decomposition of the bronze ... ( SIGHS ) I didn 't get that from Joshua . - Oh ? - There was just no time . Your life was in danger . Your life , okay ? I had to have a blood relative . I got the sample ... From your sister . What ? No . That doesn 't , um ... Claire was killed . Claire was killed in the car accident that killed my parents . Uh , Joshua told me about it I 've been to their graves ... Claudia ... Your sister 's alive . The last time your artifact " cured " people , you murdered ! That 's different . These are two specific artifacts , minimal downside . You can see for yourself look at the tags . And I 'm not being altruistic . I want something in exchange . Oh , there it is . ( LAUGHS ) Yes , of course . There 's a catch . No , no , no . Listen ... The Regents will punish me severely . Now I 'm immortal , it will be for forever . You have no idea , no idea , what it was like ... Conscious . And yet inert , in bronze . I am a scientist . My mind cannot stop . I cannot endure . No , I conceive , I conceive ... That you want me to beg them , to show you mercy . No , no , no . I want you to ask them to erase my mind . As if I didn 't exist . They must have that power by now . The Janus Coin . ADWIN : The Janus Coin will facilitate the separation of a person 's consciousness from their body . PARACELSUS : It would be like killing . It 's what you want . Do this and I 'll help you combine the artifacts that can cure Myka . - I don 't understand . - I know , it 's a lot to take in . Claire is alive . My sister is alive . And you knew ... ( STAMMERING ) And you didn 't tell me . None of this was easy , I really had to make an informed decision ... - Oh , an informed decision ? - Yeah . That must have been so nice . Listen , it 's not that simple , Claudia . Could you listen ... ( STAMMERING ) Does Joshua know ? Does Claire know about me ? Does she know where I am ? How long have you known ? No , Claudia . You 're focusing on the wrong thing ... When ... Did you ... Know ? It was part of my intel when I was tracking Rheticus ' Compass , so I knew ... Before I met you . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) No , sir . Miss Bering is still in surgery . What ? No , no , no , no , no , no . She was supposed to be out by now . Look , what 's going on ? Were there complications ? I 'm sorry . I don 't have you listed as the next of kin . You 'll have to wait till the doctor ... No , never mind . I was gonna ask her , I just ... Never mind . Thanks . I know what to do . Okay . I got ' em , right ? The thing from Hippocrates ' robe and the Chinese guy 's scalpel . Now tell me how to use these things , so I can save Myka . Bring the clasp to 1,940 degrees Fahrenheit . You must use caution , as it will begin to evaporate quickly . What ? How the hell am I gonna do that ? Well , I 'm sure there 's something here you can use , it 's the Warehouse . Okay , fine , fine . Let 's just say I can What do I do then ? I just ... I dip the scalpel in ? No , no , no . Artifacts are extremely unstable . You must introduce the scalpel into the molten metal , exactly half a centimeter at a time . You must be precise or the result could kill her . Great . No pressure . I 'll talk you through it . I 've devoted my life to this science ... Yeah , well , this is Myka 's life . Agent Lattimer , we 're running out of time . Once the Regents arrive , I can 't help you . No . No , I can 't . I can 't . I can 't , okay ? What if I mix them wrong and I ... You . You can do it . So you can blame me , if it goes wrong ? No , no . You 're her best shot . You said it yourself , I mean , I 'm not gonna let something sit on the shelf that can save Myka . Not even you . First I 'll make you mortal again . No . You have no idea how the Stone works . You can talk me through it , right ? Then you save Myka . Of course , I 'll have a gun to your head the whole time , but once you 're mortal again , you don 't need to worry about eternal Regent punishment . No , no . I don 't think ... No , it 's this or forget it . You have been lying to me . - It 's complicated . No . No . - It 's a lie . And you 've been doing it as long as I 've known you . Please , look , it was for your own protection . Protect me from what ? - From ... - From the truth ? Your sister , she 's an incredibly dangerous woman ! This will reverse everything I 've worked for my entire life . Okay , so the temperature doesn 't matter ? No . Just do it quickly , before I change my mind . ( INHALING ) Oh , God . That didn 't happen when you used it on ... What the hell ? No , it didn 't . How did you get ... ( GROANS ) When the Stone is used in proximity to the Eldunari , the Caretaker 's link to the Warehouse is increased exponentially . Oh , yeah ... The Eldunari in the Warehouse is a pretty good trick , but it 's not gonna stop me from kicking your ass ! ( YELLING ) I am now in complete control of the Warehouse . ( LAUGHS ) Thank you so much . You will be very useful for my future endeavors . This is my house now ! ( RUMBLING ) STEVE : Artie ! Artie ! Artie , something bad . Something really bad . Paracelsus ... His connection 's even stronger now . ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) CLAUDIA : This is it ... ( GROANS ) This is the end . Whoa , what are you doing ? ARTIE : Oh , my God . ( GASPS ) The ribbon wasn 't strong enough to disconnect Paracelsus . No , but you could still disconnect Mrs. Frederic . I 'm so sorry . The choice was this or death . Thank you , Claudia . That means that Mrs. Frederic is ... No longer the Caretaker . And she may never be again . MRS. FREDERIC : Paracelsus is more than just the Caretaker now . I felt him take complete control of the Warehouse . We must leave now . You got what you want , why don 't you just kill me ? I have no need to kill you . My first act as sole Caretaker will be to expel all my enemies . So , get out of my Warehouse . ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God . Pete , are you all right ? ( GROANING ) No , definitely not . Mrs. F , are you all right ? I 've seen better days , Agent Lattimer . It 's Paracelsus . He 's literally trying to chase us out of the Warehouse . Guys , we 've got to get out here . No , no , no . The umbilicus was cut off by the quake . We need another exit . Come on . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) There are other exits , right ? Follow me . ( GLASS SHATTERS ) PARACELSUS : My house now ! ( GRUNTS ) Up there . The way out . PETE : Let 's go , let 's go ! ( STAMMERING ) I can 't go . Claud ? I have to stay . No , absolutely not . You don 't know how you know it , but you know it , don 't you ? The Warehouse needs me . I ... I have to stay and fight Paracelsus . No , no . It 's too dangerous . Artie , you have made enough calls about my safety , I 'm deciding this one . I 'm sorry . Listen to me ... ( SCREAMS ) The Warehouse will protect me . Yes , I believe it might . We have to stop this freak . If you stay ... He might kill you all and I can 't stop him myself . I can 't just leave you here . I 'll fight him from the inside and you 'll fight him from the outside . You 're just gonna have to trust me on this , Jinksy . Yes . You need us to live , so we can fight another day . Come . There 's no time . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ARTIE : ( STAMMERING ) You know , I ... Very much ... I know . Me , too . You have to go . Claud . Claud , I 'm really sorry . It 's not your fault . I 'm counting on you to stop this guy more than anybody , okay ? I will . I swear it . I will , whatever it takes . ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) [ ♪ No Light , No Light ♪ by Florence + The Machine ] Paracelsus has the Warehouse . And he has Claudia . How ?

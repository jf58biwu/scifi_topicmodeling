 We always tought alien life would come from the stars . But it came from deep beneath the Pacific . What the hell is going on ? First Kaiju made land in San Francisco . The second attack hit Manila . And the third one hit Cabo . And we learned this was not gonna stop . In order to fight monsters , we created monsters of our own . FROM DIRECTOR GUILLERMO DEL TORO We needed a new weapon . The Jaeger program was born . Two pilots , our minds , our memories Connected And man and machine become one . On July 12th GO BIG Today , at the edge of our hope , OR GO EXTINCT at the end of our time , we 've chosen to believe in each other . Today , we face the monsters that are at our door ! Today , we are cancelling the apocalypse ! It is pretty cool . PACIFIC RIM 07 12 13 07 / 12 / 13 SEE IT IN REALD 3D AND IMAX 3D Sync , corrected by Johnny B. Goode

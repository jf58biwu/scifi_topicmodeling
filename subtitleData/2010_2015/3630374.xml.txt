 It will be a bloodbath . Tell me exactly what you saw . You cannot save her . But someone else can . People think that dreaming the future is a gift . They 're wrong . I don 't want to be alone . And somehow you 're supposed to help me . I can only imagine what having a bunch of excuses Could do to someone 's humanity . In order to become human again , He has to get rid of all of his powers . Now was that so hard ? I 'm sorry . I 'm gabriel , a friend of matt 's . I 'm sorry , he 's--he 's not here right now . Is there any way that you could tell me where he is ? It 's really important that I speak with him . This is your fantasy . This isn 't my life . Something wrong , sir ? Yes , something is wrong . It 's quiet . Where is everyone ? The carnival is closed , samuel . Everybody saw what you did to that town . They 're afraid of me . Can you blame them ? We finally have a home here ... A place to make a life . It 's what we wanted . It 's what you told us that you wanted . You don 't trust me anymore , do you ? You haven 't for a long time . So show me why I should . Out of trust is faith , lydia . It must be very hard for you to come by When you can steal a look into someone 's very soul With just a touch . After all I 've done for you , for all of them , I 'm the villain . And you--you seem to have become the empath To replace joseph . Everyone 's looking to you now for their voice , Aren 't they ? What have you been telling them ? Nobody respects you anymore . And I 'm gonna win it back . I love them . I need them . And I 'll do whatever I have to do ... To prove my worth . ¶ ¶ don 't worry , I 'm gonna save you . Hey , it 's peter petrelli . Is emma coolidge there ? Look , it 's- - it 's important . Just , uh ... Yeah , I already went by her place . She 's not there . Look , if you see her , call me , okay ? Yeah . Thanks . Ma ? Janice , honey , you home ? Janice ? Wow . Haven 't you ever heard of making two trips ? Oh , god , are you back inside my head ? That 's so two months ago . Here , let me give you a hand . Calm down , parkman . If I wanted you dead , we wouldn 't be talking . Then what the hell do you want ? It 's complicated . My life 's taken a turn since our time together . I suppose you could say I 'm on a fact-finding mission . Matt , honey . Janice . Hey . I thought you 'd be at work by now . Well , I took matty to day care , And my client cancelled , so ... Lucky I was home , because your friend gabriel Was in the neighborhood . He is full of stories . Stories ? From when we were partners on the force . So I figured that you guys would like to catch up , So I put a little late lunch together . Oh , it looks so good , thank you . Parkman , take a load off , have a nosh . We really need to catch up . You know , this is probably not a good time . In fact , it 's not even a big deal . It 's over . I don 't need to tell him . You kind of do . A superpowered serial killer shap e-shifted into a coed And then made a pie chart of your life . It wasn 't a pie chart . It was more like a- - - whatever . You have to tell your dad . Really ? 'cause when sylar killed my real dad , He didn 't tell me . I know . You 're right . But you ... I know . I know . How long are you gonna hold a grudge ? The whole silent treatment is getting old . We were in a good place before all this . Do you want me to come with ? Yes . No . This is something I have to do alone . I could wait . It 's probably gonna be a while . The list of things we have to talk about- - Sylar ... The cover-up of my dad 's death . Let 's not forget about the carnival . I 'm sure there 's plenty my dad 's been wanting to say About that . Yeah . Well , good luck . You 're gonna feel better when it 's all over with . Or if not , at least you 'll be caffeinated . - Claire . - Lauren . Hey . You gonna let me in ? Yeah , of course . Where 's my dad ? He just stepped out for a moment . I brought some coffee . Thought it was time To talk things over with him . I 'm sorry , but - - but why are you here exactly ? Oh , um ... Your father and I are- - No , no , that 's not- - That 's not what I was talking about . I mean , you have primatech files And satellite maps . And this is everything that my dad said That he would put behind him . Claire , I 'm just trying to help a friend . Friends do dinners and movies , okay ? You want to help ? You tell my dad whatever it is that he 's doing here , He needs to stop . I wish it was that simple . Why ? What 's gng on ? There was an incident . It was samuel sullivan . What did he do ? They 're saying it was a landslide , But we know it was samuel . Wait , you think he buried that town ? Can he even do that ? He gains more power The more specials he has around . 200 are dead , And they 're still digging out the bodies . What are you planning to do ? You know , your dad 's gonna be back any minute . Why don 't you just take this- - Actually , I have class . But it looks like you guys have this under control , So just tell him I stopped by . - Claire , wait . - Enjoy the coffee . Claire . I 've always loved the black and whites . Are they still matty 's favorite ? How do you know that ? Well , like I said , Parkman and I used to be pretty tight back in the day . We went through addiction counseling together , And faced our mutual demons . You know what , honey ? I 'm gonna show gabe here what I 've been doing in the basement . Ah , yes . The wonderful world of matt 's projects . You 're gonna love it down there . I 'm sure I will . - - You 're on a fact - finding mission ? What the hell does that mean ? I had to make sure I remembered it right . Husband and father ... You 've really figured out a way to live with your ability . You know , you may not believe this , But in some ways , You 're actually stronger than I am . Look , I 'm not afraid of you , okay ? So if this is about revenge- - Well , after what you did to me , I was tempted . But I don 't want to be that person anymore . - Uh - huh . I need you to go inside my head again . you 're serious . Oh , wow , you are insane . If I am , it 's because That 's what my powers have made me . I can 't live with them anymore , parkman . So you need to take them away . You want me to- - How am I supposed to do that ? Create a mental block , repress them . I don 't really care , to be honest . All I know is that once I 'm free From the temptation of my ability ... - Mm - hmm ? You 're gonna be normal ? I 'm sorry , that ship sailed , what , 50 murders ago . I 'm asking nicely . The last time that I was inside your head , You turned my life into a living hell . What makes you think I 'm gonna risk that ? Janice ... And the kid . I really do want to change . But I 'm insane ... Remember ? And all you have to do is point . Fine , I will try . But you have to let janice go . Consider it a gesture of good faith . Hey , mom . What 's wrong ? Oh , it 's nathan . The stonecutters called . They needed a final wording for his headstone , And I didn 't know what to say . I guess it 's the finality of it . I mean , they 're just words , But when you write them down , When you etch them in stone ... I know , mom . Maybe it was selfish of me , peter , But I just needed to see you . I needed to be sure you were okay . Because of your vision . I had the dream too , mom . I saw all the people . And sylar ... I think he was trying to help emma . You saw that too ? Whatever this mission is , peter , remember this : One isolated act does not make sylar your friend 's savior . I need you to help me find him , mom . I know you know where he is . Sylar 's never been far from my thoughts . But I 'm begging you , don 't go . He murdered nathan , And the last time you faced him , he almost killed you . Mom , emma 's in trouble . People 's lives are at stake . Nathan would never turn his back on them . And you know that I can 't either . This is gonna end badly . Samuel is crazy . My dad 's gonna take him down , And there is no way this is gonna end well . What ? What do you want me to say ? Well , what do you think I should do ? Um , I don 't know . You 've got a humanities lecture in 20 minutes . Here 's a crazy idea - - maybe you should go to class for once . Did you hear anything I just said ? I did . Yeah , all of it . But I mean , what are you really gonna do , claire ? Your dad was right about the carnival . You never should have gone there . Look , samuel is a bad guy , yes . But the rest of the carnival is all family and children . And they just want to live their lives Being open about their abilities . I thought you said that They were giving samuel his power . But they don 't know that . You were only there for one day . How could you possibly know for sure ? I need to borrow your car . No . I thought you would back me up on this . You say you want a normal life , right ? Just let your dad handle it . Come on , please . Just come to class with me . Or not . Bring it back full . she 's not answering . She said she had a class . Claire , call me as soon as you get this . You shouldn 't have let her go without talking to me first . What was I supposed to do , Drag her by her hair and lock her in your closet ? What do you want to do ? We go . If samuel 's escalating his attacks , We can 't afford to sit around and wait to see What he 's gonna do next . You 're right , but you 're also emotional . Look , this samuel is a threat And not just to claire . You go in with less than 100 % focus ... I can handle this . You don 't have to worry about me . That 's not an option anymore . Let 's go . Claire . We need to talk . What are you doing here ? Your father is coming for samuel , To kill him . Claire , if samuel finds out , he 's- - I know . That 's why I came ahead . I have seen things like this go wrong before , And I don 't want my dad or anyone else getting hurt . But we don 't have a lot of time . Samuel will never go for it . He 'll never turn himself in . We have to try . Claire , he is not listening to me , to anyone . If your father is really on his way , I should get amanda . And what , lydia- - run away ? Has it come to that ? I can 't say I blame you- - What I did to that town , all those people . Claire , I ... I 'd hoped you 'd have a better reason to come back to us . How could you do that ? I don 't know what I was thinking . I wish I could take it all back ... And so many other things- - joseph . Did I ever tell you the first carnival act That joseph and I ever saw was the trapeze ? The way they flung themselves through the air , We both thought they had powers , just like us . But when we went backstage , the man told us The only power he had was gravity . No matter how high he went , It was always there to catch him . I 've come to realize That gravity is different things to people . For much of my life , joseph was mine . I 've been losing my way . And now even my own family is afraid of me . And the only strength I have left- - You have to take responsibility . You have to turn yourself over . To your father ? He 's not exactly known for his mercy . If you give yourself up , He will not hurt you , I promise . Please , samuel , Listen to her . If you care about this family , Then protect them . There 's samuel- - on the midway . Got him . Wait a second . Is that claire ? At 2 : 00 . Hello , claire . Dad , where are you ? Close . I heard you stopped by earlier . Thanks for the coffee . What 's the situation there ? Samuel wants to surrender . Really ? Why ? - To protect his family . He 's willing to turn himself over As long as the rest of the carnival stays safe And under the grid . And you trust him ? If there 's a chance that we can do this Without anyone getting hurt , don 't we have to try ? Dad , it 's the best plan , all right ? You get samuel , and nobody gets hurt . All right . Tell him to meet us in the field outside of the carnival . I 'll see you soon . He 's surrendering . And you think he 's just gonna give himself up ? I don 't know , but claire seems to think so , And I have to trust her . It 's done . He wants you to meet him in the field . Are you sure this is a good idea ? Oh , I wouldn 't worry . If it 's a setup , you 're just gonna get a better shot at him , Out in the open , away from everybody . Wait a second . I 'll do down and walk him out . Keep him in the crosshairs . Hey ... Be careful . I know my recent actions have caused some of you To question where it is my heart lies . I regret what I 've done . I acted impulsively , And that has brought one of them- - An agent- - To our door . it 's okay . It 's okay . They just want me . Claire has helped arrange a peaceful surrender . I 'll go with them . No , no , please , listen . I know everyone will not agree with this decision . But it 's the only way . The safety of each and every one of you And keeping this family together is what matters most to me . And if that means I have to leave , So be it . All right , parkman , I did my part . I let janice walk . Now it 's your turn . I know . I know . I said I would try . Aah ! Nothing 's changed . I know you can do this , parkman , what 's wrong ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Okay . Okay . I ... I can 't . - Try again . You know , maybe- - maybe it 's not me . Sylar , come on , maybe it 's you . Maybe you 're just fighting it . Maybe you really don 't want to let go of these powers . - No ! You 're lying ! - I 'm not lying ! Matt , what 's going on ? No , stop ! Stop ! No ! Oh , god , please let her go . Hey ! Hey , look at me . Look at me ! Come on , let her go . She had nothing to do with this . Come on , let her go . Let her go . I 'll try again . Come on . That 's not good enough . You see what you made me do ? - Hey ! I don 't even know if I can do this for you--come on . Maybe you need a little more motivation . You will purge me of these powers , parkman ... Or I will use them- - I will use them all . And trust me , I can get really creative . Damn . Samuel ! Come quickly ! No . No , no , no , no . No . No ! You need to put pressure on the wound . I need your help . Come on . You wanted to know what was in my heart . You ... Did ... This ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . They needed a villain ... Someone worse than me . You gave that to them . Thank you . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . No , it 's too late , claire . She 's gone . Come on , dad . Pick up , please . Samuel . Dad . I found him on the hill ... With this ! Are you okay ? Claire , I didn 't do it . I didn 't shoot anything .. You murderer ! He 's the one . You brought him here . You 're one of them . hey , back off ! No , don 't hurt them . We 're better than this . Take him to the house of mirrors . Tie him up . And her ? My trailer . get off ! Get off ! No ! Dad ! Dad ! let go ! Samuel , he didn 't do it ! get off ! Get off ! If you hurt her , I swear to god ... That 's the problem , isn 't it ? One cruel thought is all it takes . These powers make it so easy . I understand that , believe me . But you don 't have to use them like this . Except I do . The powers are me now . You 've been there , dealt with the abilities , The constant temptation . Tell me , how do you compartmentalize ? How do you keep them from overwhelming The rest of your life ? You start by accepting the fact That you 're more than just your abilities . Come on , we 're people first . Please , let her go . Look , I 'll- - I 'll try to do what you want , But you got to give me a couple minutes To make sure she 's okay . Last chance , parkman . Come on . It 's okay . Come on . - That 's sylar , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I 'm so sorry . This is crazy . He wants me to take away his powers and make him normal . Meanwhile , I looked inside his head long enough To realize that he 's serious , But I can 't give him what he wants . Forget what he wants . I work with monsters like this . He 's broken inside , matt . We have to bury him So that he cannot hurt anyone else . Yeah , okay . Just go . Go , and don 't come back until I call you . All right , get on with it . You were right- - I was holding back . It 's all about motivation , right ? What if I told you that I can be special , But to do it , I 'd have to hurt a lot of people ? Should I ? You ? You could never hurt anyone . Mommy . I don 't- - I don 't feel any different . Try something , go ahead , on me . Come on . You did it . My powers are gone . No , they 're not gone . They 're just buried- - Somewhere that you can never get to them . You 've threatened my family for the last time . What did you do ? I know exactly what scares you , gabriel . And it 's being alone with your immortality . What did you do to me ? I have trapped you inside your twisted mind . You 're gonna be alone , sylar- - very much alone- - In this nightmare that will last forever . And the best part about it is that when I leave here , You 're not gonna remember what I did . And you 're gonna live every empty day like it 's real . You said you would help me . Yeah , well , I guess there 's still a little of you Left inside me ... Because I lied . Enjoy hell . Parkman ? Parkman ? matt ? Matt ! Samuel said you 'd come . Thank god you 're here . I need your help . Ah ... Finally , there 's a doctor in the house . What happened ? - We were attacked . - You were attacked ? By who ? People who don 't understand us , emma ... People who fear us . It doesn 't matter . What matters is that you 're here . You 're not just gonna heal me , emma . You 're gonna help us make a new world for ourselves . Yeah . We 'll show them , emma . We 'll show them how great we can be . Matt ? Matt ! Hey , man . Sorry , I was , uh- - I was working downstairs . That 's okay , man . Been a long time . Yeah , how are you ? What ? - Sylar is here . - What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about what you 're thinking . You 're gonna take him . You can 't just take him ! Look , people die , matt . Sylar has to save them . Peter , he 's a murderer ! Hey ! Come on , stop . Listen . He 's trapped , peter . What the hell did you do ? I went inside his head , And I trapped him in his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . I have to bring him back . No . No , you can 't do that . You go into his head , you might not come out . Peter . Peter , don 't . Peter ! No ! Peter ! Matt ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ! Tracy strauss . Noah bennet told me to call if anything went wrong . I went to bennet . I thought- - Look what they 've done ... These so-called normal people . How could you let this happen ? What I did was wrong . I know that . But I was willing to sacrifice myself To protect you ... To save this family that we 've all come to love . The outside world has proven once again That people like us will never be accepted . We 've all seen it ... In the eyes of those who come to see our shows ... Dazzled by our abilities ... But filled with revulsion of who we are . I saw it again yesterday ... In that small town over the hill ... And today in the bullets that struck me And murdered our dear lydia . It 's time . It 's time we put fear behind us . It 's time we showed the world ... What we truly are . What we truly are .

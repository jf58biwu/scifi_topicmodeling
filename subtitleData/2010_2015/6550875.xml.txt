 Robert Corning . East 84th street . 80 years old . Would have folded if you whispered at him . Never could have I.D. ' d you through his coke-bottle lenses . But you beat him down with a pry bar until his brains fell out . You beat him while his ... I just ... I need ... I need you to say it . Say it loud . " I panicked , and I killed the old man . " Then you can turn around and go back to your cell and save us both some time . 84th street ? Was that that thing they kept asking me about before I went in ? Don 't do that , Nagy . I 've been waiting for this conversation for eight years . So have you . Any time I thought about you , I thought about what you did . How you put me here . Guess someone was looking out for me . Evened up the score . You 're gonna trip and fall . And when you do , I 'm going to be there to make sure you don 't get back up . So you think about that . You eat your cornflakes , you get on the bus , you take a dump without wondering if this isn 't the day that I get the confession you owe me . Is that it ? Yeah . Go ahead . He was brushing his teeth . He probably heard something . Never saw it coming . Pry bar on the window . Exits out the front to his car . It 's Nagy . It 's got his signature all over it . Doesn 't look like anything 's missing except a couple of paintings . Nagy 's no art thief . He would 've picked this place clean . He got spooked and bolted . I just ... I just wonder what made him jump . What can I do for you guys ? Hey . What can I do for you guys ? Hey , the kid . Did he see it ? Heard it . Been covering some burglary conditions in this neighborhood , and we think ... This isn 't a burglary , though , is it ? And you 're walking all over my crime scene . Look , we think we ... Hey , hey , our bad . We just thought you might want some extra bodies . Thanks . Do me a favor , make a coffee run . I 'm light and sweet . Get something for yourselves . I got it . Let 's find a boss . Hey , the hell with that . Let 's ... Let 's find Nagy . Bobby , it 's a homicide . You saw the attitude . We give them his name , what are they gonna do ? Let us take lunch orders next time ? Yeah , but what have we even got to pick him up for ? All right . We know he can 't lay off the art fast , so he still needs cash . We follow him to his next job . We collar him for the burglary , and if we get lucky , then he 's still packing evidence from this job . Come on , it 's just another murder to these guys . We can make this mean something . Well ? Speak to me , people . What 's Nagy doing right now ? He 's coming out of the clinic , going West . Second trip in two days , maybe he 's got something the doctor can 't fix . Teddy , I hear your voice on my frequency . Better be something interesting . Virgil , you 've got eyes ? I 'm on him , sarge . Just turned North . Could be back to a library , could be back to the train . Wrong details . Okay , sarge , what am I looking for ? Is he carrying anything ? Is he ... Is he looking at anything ? Hands are empty , walking with purpose . - Shirt tucked in or out ? - What ? Last time we saw him , he was with the doctor . His shirt was tucked in . - Is it untucked now ? - Tucked . All right . He 's headed back to the hole . He 's probably taking the train home . Virgil , Holly , stay with him . Teddy , go ahead and jump ahead . Two days , Bob . - So ? - So the guy 's done nothing . Didn 't have time eight years ago to move the paintings . He 's gonna take us to them . And I 'm gonna take him and break him . If he did East 84th . No one ever made the case . You need something here , Ed ? Yeah , some kind of status report on the non-extracurricular work . You know , the stuff they 're gonna ask me about over at CompStat , where I 'm gonna have to explain to them why it is that you haven 't done one ... It 's Scott Rawlings , silver gun robberies . It was a .25 Raven , by the way . We got probable cause on Tate James for the Bushwick shooting . And we got an address in Newark for Lynne Robey . Anything else ? Let me get back to this , okay ? Why 'd you warn him , Bob ? Because I wanted to look into his eyes , see if he still felt safe . Seemed to me like you were reminding yourself how much you hate him . He 's still in the city , which means the art or the money is still here . Eight years , man . Waiting . Him or you ? We 're out of the hole at Atlantic . Looks like he 's headed home . I 'm about two minutes out . Holly , peel off , wait for Teddy . Virgil , go ahead and take him home just in case you 're wrong . Why am I peeling off ? Man 's been in jail for eight years . Sooner or later he 's gonna notice you . Police ! Don 't move ! Down on the ground ! Get down on the ground ! Get down on the ground ! Get down ! Get down ! 10-13 , shots fired , 574 Atlantic Avenue . Blue Saturn ! No plates ! Go ! That was a hit ! Where 's Nagy ? - Gone ! Think he was shot . - Gun 's gone too . I 'll call a bus for this guy . Don 't bother . Ironside S01E06 " Pentimento " Michael Mallen , burglary , robbery , burglary , burglary , Grand Larceny . Guy 's not a shooter , Bob . Or it was the one thing he knew how to get away with . Perp two dumped the Saturn . Stolen rental car . So he 's out there somewhere waiting for me to beat some answers out of him . Meanwhile ... Meanwhile witness says Nagy picked up Mallen 's gun . Crime scene confirms he 's wounded . Well , if he bleeds out , I guess you win . I need a murder confession on East 84th Street . Then he can bleed out . He 's not even supposed to be here . Some cops have to go home after a shoot , some have to go to work . Which do you think he is ? He told you that ? I didn 't ask . You didn 't ask your detective about his first time killing a man ? Where 's Teddy and Holly ? Backtracking Nagy . The clinic , library , his apartment . Now with our second shooter , start narrow , widen out . Similar rap sheets , same neighborhood . I got it . You talk to Internal Affairs yet ? They said after they talk to the D.A. Captain says there are plenty of witnesses . - I 'm not worried . - Sure you are . They 're gonna bring up the excessive force complaints . It 's old news . It was old news when I brought you on board . I.A.B. , shooting review board . It 's not gonna feel good . But if they 're doing their jobs right , then eventually it 's gonna take the weight off your back . What if they don 't do it right ? Well , then they gotta go through me . And I got a long history of winning arguments . Man . Third apartment building he 's cased tonight . Come on , come on , come on , come on . He made us ! Give me your hands . Give me your hands ! Okay ! Damn . Okay ! Okay ! - I didn 't know you were cops . - Sure . Just out for a walk ? Well , I had to take a piss . - Gee . - Burglar 's tools . Class " A " misdemeanor . You might as well write me up for public urination . You know , you 're right . Burglary , though , is a felony . Bobby , hold on . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... Sends you back down for five to ten . Hey , he can 't do that . Man , that 's not right ! You wrote the story , I 'm just finishing it . - Come here . - No , man . There are rules , there are rules ! You 're not gonna let him do this , are you ? You can 't let him do that ! Come on , let 's get outta here . - Come here . - Hey . Hey ! Damn . You really wanna do this ? Put bracelets on the bastard that beat an old man to death while his grandson listened ? Hell , yeah ! Detectives break him for East 84th , it 's still our collar that got him there . It 's still us testifying to probable cause . Look , you saw what he did , G ! This is ours . All right , get outta here . We know he made two different visits . I told you , I can 't tell you anything . Dr. Ryder , this man is wounded and armed . Give him enough time , he either dies or hurts someone . I don 't care that you don 't like cops . What makes you think I don 't like cops ? Let 's just say I recognize the look . You understand the restrictions of doctor-patient confidentiality laws ? I understand that they do allow you to tell us if you have any knowledge that Stan Nagy committed or was the victim of a crime . I don 't have any knowledge that he visited me as someone who committed or was the victim of a crime . Okay ? Mr. Thompson ? Thank you very much . Think something 's up with her ? Yeah . Maybe . I don 't know . My radar 's all screwed up today . Look , you did everything right . It happened the way it happened . I didn 't spot him fast enough . Sarge would 've . He 's the sarge . I wish I got there 30 seconds earlier . I didn 't , Virgil 's still okay , and you kept someone from getting shot . Let 's go . - Found perp two . - Copy that . Sean Rourke . Same profile as our dead shooter . Burglary , robbery , a bar assault . Nothing puts him in this league . Two of them ever get pinched together ? No , but Midtown North thinks they 've both done business with a fence named Nick Sturgess . Sturgess is the last of the old-school westies . Nagy did business with him back in the day . He runs a trading company . A warehouse on 11th Street . I 'll take a ride with you . Why don 't you go home ? Somebody 's gotta take a ride with you . Yeah , okay . Doesn 't look like Nagy was planning on staying long . No library stamp . Guess we got Nagy for grand theft book . " Diptych ... " Laughing Crane " , " Crying Crane " . " Stolen from the Denver Museum , 1989 . " Laughing Crane " returned anonymously , June 2005 . " That 's three months after Ironside sent Nagy up . So all we have to do , find Nagy , get him to tell us where the second painting is , and admit that he stole both of them from East 84th Street eight years ago . Bashed some old guy 's head in . Piece of cake , right ? You think it 's gonna be like this with everybody that Ironside locks up ? Minute they get out , he 's looking to put them back in ? Something happened between them . He 's been running hot the last few days . Hotter than usual ? And how can you tell ? The two days we were following Nagy , you ever see him make a call ? No . No cell phone and never used a pay phone . Yeah , he did . - What 'd they do ? - No . Ask me what I think you did . I got a clean conscience . Yeah , that 's because you 're a sociopath . You don 't know right from wrong . Is this just a routine ball bust , or do we have something to talk about ? Detective , tell him what we have to talk about . About him sending Mike Mallen and Sean Rourke to hit Stan Nagy . Damn . Right there . See that ? See that light go out ? Hiring the first two idiots who come in here with stolen TV sets as shooters , makes you really , really cheap or really , really nervous . See , nervous is what I think . Nagy scared you , and now you missed . Now you got a good reason to be scared . Nothing more to say but ... " talk to my lawyer , " right ? Yeah . Let 's get out of here . Let you get back to feeding the great city of New York . Out of the way ! Whoa . Sorry about that . - Here , let me help you . - No , I got it , it 's okay . No , no . Hey . Hey ! I broke it , I bought it . Look at them apples . I know you don 't ship produce it in wooden crates ? And a forklift driver doesn 't wear $ 600 ferragamos . - What ? - I tend to notice shoes . Think that 'll fly as probable cause ? That 's for the court to decide . Meanwhile , Rourke 's gonna hear that Sturgess got locked up . He 's gonna pop his head out of whatever hole he 's in . Give himself up or start running . - And so will Nagy . - It 's a shaky arrest , Bob . Right on the edge of bad . Hey , Ed ... I know what the edge is . - Get the hell in here . - Hey ! Who are you putting your hands on ? You know what you just did ? Yeah , I found your perp for you . Before he comes through the door , when I can 't talk to him , get in his car , his apartment , without getting a warrant . Then get a warrant ! You got an answer for everything , don 't you , officer ? You see those paintings ? They 're not registered . Insurance , receipts ... Nothing . They could be hanging on Nagy 's damn wall right now , and we wouldn 't be able to identify them . Forget about proving they 're from East 84th Street . Then it 's a good thing we got that burglary . While you had your thumb up your fat ... - Hey ! - Come on ! Let go ! You need to answer me one more time . I 'm on your ass ! Tell that to Corning 's grandkid . Tell him that burglary 's enough . - Hey ! Come on ! Come on ! - All right ! All right ! You believe that guy ? Wasn 't for us , Nagy 'd still be on the street bashing somebody 's head in ! Let it go . This ain 't over . This ain 't over by a long shot , man . We gotta get our stories straight . - All right ? Every detail ! - All right . - No problem . - Got you . Hey , you 're still here . Yeah , picked up a lead on the second shooter . What have you been doing ? Nothing nearly that cool . - So ... - Don 't . I 'm good . Doesn 't mean you might not wanna talk about it . Actually , that 's what " I 'm good " means . Come on . Call records off a pay phone in Nagy 's halfway house . A few numbers of interest . Called Nick Sturgess twice . Guess he decided to hit him right between the eyes . Remind you of anyone you know ? Yeah . Called the clinic a couple times . Yeah , I wanna go back at that doctor tomorrow . Might have just been a cat-and-dog thing but ... I got a feeling she was keeping something in her pocket . Always follow your cat-and-dog thing . Look at the call he made yesterday afternoon . 2 : 41 p.m. Weber Gallery . I remember the call . Someone doing an artforum article about " The Laughing Crane " . The questions got a little strange , and when I asked for a name , he hung up . We brokered its recovery in 2005 . - Where was it recovered from ? - No idea . It was returned anonymously for an $ 80,000 reward . But doesn 't that mean that you might have paid off the same guy who stole it ? The Denver Museum paid . Wouldn 't be the first time . But " The Crying Crane " never resurfaced . Both pieces probably sold on the black market for $ 3 million or $ 4 million apiece . Does he have to touch the paintings ? Well , he 's my boss . But if you 'd like to tell him not to touch the paintings , feel free . So after they were stolen in Denver , you think they both ended up in a private collection ? There are collectors who care about provenance , and there are collectors who don 't . What about Robert Corning ? Which kind was he ? Horrible what happened to Robert . - I understand his nephew ... - Grandson . Two paintings were pulled off his wall . Neither was registered to his insurance company . So was " The Laughing Crane " one of them ? I don 't feel comfortable speaking ill of the dead . Might be the only way to get him some justice . It would have been consistent with his reputation , but I don 't know for sure . Sergeant , that 's really ... You know this is a pentimento , right ? - Excuse me ? - Well to ... You see how the paint is bubbled and cracked ? He didn 't strip all the varnish off the underlying painting . The eyes are slightly different colors of blue . Like , the one on the left here ? That 's from the original painting underneath . But what do I know ? I 'm just some guy who shows up for the free wine and never buys anything . Pay phone to Sturgess . The 2nd , 12 : 51 , five minutes . Day Nagy got out . He checks in , throws his crap on his bed , calls Sturgess , asks , " Where 's my money ? " Assuming Nagy did East 84th . Assuming he gave Sturgess " The Laughing Crane " eight years ago . Assuming it came from 84th Street in the first place . It did . Next call , come on . Pay phone , Weber Gallery . 16 : 22 , 17 : 35 . Two minutes , then seven minutes . The call Weber told us about . Call with Sturgess didn 't go well . He wants to know how much the paintings are worth , how much he 's owed . Pay phone to the clinic , the 3rd . 09 : 31 , two minutes . Making an appointment . You ever make a doctor 's appointment in two minutes ? Well , he went right after . He got there at 10 : 00 . He asked if Dr. Ryder was in . Someone said yes , he went . There 's your dog-and-cat thing . Good . Background : driver 's license , school records , medical boards . - In all my spare time ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Come on , go . From the clinic , Nagy goes home . Calls Sturgess at 14 : 10 for ten minutes . I know this number . I dumped Sturgess 's call log when we locked him up . Sturgess called the clinic . He hung up with Nagy and called ... Dr. Megan Ryder . Aka Megan Sturgess . Maiden name ? No , legally changed when she went to medical school . She 's Nick Sturgess 's daughter . That 's how Nagy scared him . It also explains why Sturgess was in such a hurry to hire Rourke and Mallen . These guys ... They 're hunting each other . Doctor-patient laws hasn 't changed in the last 24 hours . But Stan Nagy wasn 't your patient , was he ? We know who your father is . We know that Nagy did business with Nick Sturgess eight years ago . Do you know what it 's like ? Waiting for your father 's name to come up ? Knowing that when it does , someone like you will be asking ? Sure . You grew up on the other side of a lot of closed doors . Men coming in and out of the house at 3 : 00 a.m. Guns lying around like magazines . Learned to spot an unmarked car 'cause they 're always parked in front of your house . And there 's that awful moment , when you 're about 15 , when you go from being afraid that your father 's gonna be taken away to kinda maybe hoping someone will . Hoping came a lot earlier than that . My father is not a good man . He didn 't want to let me leave . Didn 't want me to be anything more than his ... daughter . So how 'd you get out ? There were a lot of things I could hold against him . The kind of things you might imagine . Some that I hope you never can . We haven 't spoken in five , six years . He called you two days ago . He called the clinic . I did not take the call . What about Nagy ? What did he want ? He wanted to know if I was Nick Sturgess 's daughter . I told him to leave , and he did . Just like that ? It was scarier than that . 2005 , Stan Nagy brings you two paintings . Gets collared before you can lay them off . I got nothing to say without a lawyer present . Did I ask you to talk ? Turns out , they were already stolen once . Which means they 're not in any insurance inventory . Which means they 're like currency . A fence 's dream . Now you can talk . Did you rip ' em off or was Nagy just impatient ? I got nothing to say without a lawyer present . Eight years . He 's got a lot of time on his hands . Does a lot of homework . Finds out that " The Laughing Crane " was returned to the museum for a no-questions-asked reward . Finds out you got a daughter . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Never mind she wouldn 't piss on you if ... Hey ! You don 't cross that line . Family 's out of bounds . So you do have something to say without a lawyer present . You know the rules . It doesn 't matter if she loves me . She hates me . You threaten my blood ... I 'm gonna answer . You don 't get to kill Nagy , Nick . Not until I 'm done with him . Now this getaway driver , this Sean Rourke , he 's not nearly smart enough to stay hidden much longer . Which means you don 't have a lot of time to make a deal with me . What are you offering ? You connect the dots between Nagy , " The Laughing Crane " , and the East 84th Street murder , and I 'll try not to connect the dots between you and Rourke . I 'll look the other way . Or you make whatever deal you gotta make with him to keep his mouth shut . Well , that 's ... Hey , Nick . Hey , hey . What ? What the hell , Ed ? His lawyer went around us to the D.A. ' s office . They 're shutting us down . - Just ... Just give me five more minutes . He 's gonna make a deal . - I can close him . - No . No ? You 're a short and curly away from a false arrest charge . The number of people who 'll defend you fit in a very small room . So you 're not screwing me ? You 're just saving me from myself ? Big part of my day , every day . Is this a bad time ? Depends on what you want . State Troopers found Sean Rourke on I-84 . Turned into a car chase , then a foot pursuit . But they lost him in Poughkeepsie . And ? He 's got an ex-wife in Poughkeepsie . - Take Holly . - I can go . No , you can 't . You 're on modified duty . And why are you still here anyway ? Go home . That 's what I 'm gonna do . - You going home ? - If that 's okay with you . Sure . I guess . No sign of Rourke yet . Only ways in and out are front and side door . His ex-wife got home an hour ago , went inside , turned on the TV . Okay , we need anything , we 'll give you a call . You know , Virgil lets me take the shotgun seat . I have long legs . Do I look like Virgil ? A little around the eyes . Now you look a lot like Virgil . Do you mind if I turn on the radio ? If it 's that same emo crap you listen to in the office , yes . Hey , Holly ? - What ? - Look at the car . She left the air-conditioning running so high , it 's still dripping . So why 'd she crack the windows ? - Rourke 's wife ... - Ex-wife . Ex-wife . Came home an hour ago . Troopers chased Rourke , lost him on foot two hours ago . What if he called her , and she picked him up somewhere ? - Then dropped him off ? - What if she didn 't ? She comes home , sees the cops parked down the block , doesn 't wanna bolt and look suspicious , so she ... Leaves him sweating in the car , rolls down the windows , and goes inside . Ex-wife . You feeling this , or you just don 't want to let me sleep ? Mostly feeling this . Sean ! Run ! Police ! Don 't move ! Don 't ... Come on , dude ! You 're losing ! You shot at me yesterday ! You think about how little an excuse I 'm looking for . You 're just riding by Harlem at 1 : 00 a.m. ? You know how it is . Brain gets working , you can 't sleep . I didn 't wanna wake Penny , so got on the bike . - Next thing I know ... - It 's all right , man . My brain 's been bouncing too . Yeah , I heard it was Burke in that Brooklyn thing . How 's his head ? He 's a tough kid . Reminds me of you in a lot of ways . Good and bad . Hey , Stan Nagy was in the middle of it . Trying to close out that old man 's murder once and for all . Looked him in his eye . Nothing but hate , man . Both ways . What ? Nothing , nothing . It 's a good chapter to close . I knew then what I know now , we would have gone all the way , partner . Gotten that murder confession instead of waiting for that pail from major case to lay down and die . That 's not how it went , Bobby . You know that . We were wrong . You for what you did , me for thinking I was being a good partner for not stopping you . Cut plenty of corners back in the day , G. Wasn 't bending rules , man . - You broke the law . - You wanna do that ? You wanna start going through all the things we did , which ones were legal , which ... We screwed up a homicide . We lost Nagy over a trumped up burglary . We cost us three years of our career , coming back out of the wilderness . So , what , now the cold days are all on me ? - Hey ! - Hey , wait . It had nothing to do with the fact that you were drunk half the time , and the other half , you ... you got heavy-handed . Hey , man . No , no . You 're right . These days I dig up regrets like dinosaur bones . But I know there 's a difference between fixing mistakes ... and trying to make ' em go away . Thanks for the coffee . Yeah . I wanna make a deal . Okay , two cops and half a dozen witnesses I.D. ' d you shooting Stan Nagy . What kinda deal do you want ? Mikey gets killed , then he goes silent on me . Right 's right . I don 't owe him anything . Clean it up , Sean . " Nick Sturgess gave me and Mike Mallen ' x ' dollars to shoot ' y ' . " Start from the start . Use names and go slow . He ... Nagy had a beef with Nick over something ... Money . He threatened Nick 's daughter . - I don 't know her name . - So Nick got nervous ? Nick got mad . Laying off jewelry and TV sets ? Anyone knows there 's not a lot of future there . But Sturgess offers us 25 to hit Nagy . Suddenly Mikey 's got this idea he 's gonna be a hit man . You looked into that mouth breather 's eyes and figured you 'd get through to him with an algebra problem ? Yeah , thought it was kind of a good-cop / bad-cop thing or ... Is his statement gonna be enough to go after Sturgess ? It 's enough to force Sturgess to talk to me . Place is empty . You should take a look . Thanks , Keith . Hey , put in a call to crime scene , okay ? Holly and Teddy are at Sturgess 's place . Wife said he never came home . Maybe he 's running ? Or ... Nagy got to him . No , Nagy came in through the window . However he was patched up , it ripped open . He sat down . Yeah . Wrote Sturgess a note . Nagy went out the same way he came in . Sturgess finds the note . Unlocked . Left in a hurry . Empty . Took cash ? And a gun too . Nah , he 's not running . He 's not paying off Nagy , - but they 're gonna meet up . - Where ? Where does Nagy know for sure Sturgess will show ? And get himself patched up at the same time . Clinic doesn 't open for a couple of hours . But the front door is unlocked . There 's blood on the ground . Esu is five minutes behind us . Holly and Teddy are still on the bridge . You got a gun on you ? Yeah . You 're not supposed to . No . Call an ambulance . He wouldn 't let me . Where 's his gun ? Top drawer . Stan . You 're dying . You don 't think I know that ? You killed me , you bastard . It 's time to come clean . You and Sturgess . There 's no difference . There 's rules to be followed . No , Stan . The old man died . Now you didn 't mean to do it . You got scared . You didn 't know he was gonna die , right ? You and Sturgess . There 's no difference ! You steal my life , you steal my time . No , no , no . Tell me , tell me . Tell me it was you , Stan . Tell me that you were the one that killed him . - Just tell me it was you . - Don 't pay me . You don 't have to pay me . Why did you pay him ? Don 't pay him . He 's weak . You didn 't make me ... East 84th Street , Stan . The old man . Tell me ! Tell me that you went in and you robbed him and you killed the man while his grandson heard him scream . The kid heard him scream , Stan ! - There was a kid there ! - East 84th street . You didn 't make me for that . No , you just cheated . Yeah , yeah , I did . - Yeah . - Okay , I cheated . All right , I stole eight years of your life . You beat me , you won . So tell me how you beat me , tell me how you won . Eight years of my life . I could 've gone through that window . But I didn 't go through the window . All right , I cheated . I told you , I cheated already . All right ? So just ... Stan . Stan , East 84th Street . The old man , you stole his art . Just tell me . Come on , man . Come on , let 's make this right . Just say yes . - The hell with you ! - Tell me how you beat me . Tell me it was you ! Tell me you did it . - Just say it ! - To hell with all of you . Just say it . Nagy , just say it . You can kill me , go ahead . You can kill me . - Please . - Stan . Stan . You can 't beat ... You can 't beat ... You 're dying . Come on , man . Just say it , just say it . Nagy . Nagy ! I tried to save him after I watched him kill my father . It 's because you 're a doctor . Yeah ? Is that why ? Did he say anything ? He was dying . He was incoherent . So he didn 't know about you ? That you were the one who returned " The Laughing Crane " ? Nick Sturgess is not gonna return a $ 4 million painting for $ 80,000 . He 's not in that business . It would take someone with access . Different priorities . 80,000 was enough to put myself through med school . Like I told the other detective , I was going to do anything to get out of that house . He never said a word about what I did . Maybe that 's what ... passed for love . Maybe he understood me better when I was a thief . What happens now ? There 's no law against returning a stolen painting . And not ratting out your dad . Of course , if you had the second picture , maybe to remind yourself of where you 've been and ... what you 've done , to scare yourself into being better ? At some point , I would have to come after you . I 'd have to come after you . Then again , only a fool would spend eight years dwelling on the wrong things they did for the right reasons . Teddy 's in Central Booking with Rourke . Holly 's at the M.E. with the bodies . Are you gonna sleep in the locker room again tonight ? We were working a case . I had to pull my weight . And you killed a man . It 's okay for that to mean something to you . The next few weeks , months ... you 're gonna find answers to questions about yourself you never even knew you had . That 's the pep talk ? Pep talk is you gotta go home . And kiss your wife . Kiss your kids . And then you think about the fact that you could go home . Which means you did everything right on the street . Yeah ? All right . You call me from your house phone inside three hours . Or don 't come back . I 'm on a foot post , 4-5 and 8 . This guy comes out of the Starling Hotel flying on Meth . He has this old .38 . Looks like he bought it off Eliot Ness . He lifts his gun . I shoot him , twice , center mass . He just stands there . Looks at me and says , " What 'd you do that for ? I was gonna kill myself anyway . " Puts a gun to his head , pulls the trigger , the gun misfires . He sits down on the sidewalk , says , " Man , this isn 't my day . " I think Virgil will come through it . Yeah , he seems like the type . Nagy kept saying I killed him . I read your report . He said a lot of things . It wasn 't the blood . And it wasn 't even the kid . Though I kept telling myself it was . It was the toothbrush . It was still in his hand like he was gonna go back to his grandson and finish brushing his teeth when it was over . It was a watch for me . A woman 's wristwatch . I still don 't look in the mirror when I brush my teeth . Well ... maybe tonight you will .

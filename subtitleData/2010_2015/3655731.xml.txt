 Previously on Caprica ... Daniel Graystone stole my technology and killed my men . For that he must pay . Eventually , I will destroy your company , but before that you have so many precious things . Until the debt is paid . I 've been seeing my dead brother everywhere . I don 't know what 's going on . There was a crash in the city , and I thought I saw my brother there . He led me to this poster . There . That 's where it happened . The accident , that 's where he was killed . Tamara 's out there in v-world . I 'm getting her back . Who are you ? I go by Emmanuelle . Heracles said you were easy to find . Look for the cube wandering all alone . All right , start guiding . I can 't let my dad know I 'm inside the robot . I don 't trust him . Hi , daddy . You 're an avatar , a virtual representation of Zoe . What are you doing to her ? Stop it , Dr. Graystone ! Stop ! I know this robot can work . And Zoe is the key . Caesar , go ! Zoe . Come on , it 's bad enough you got me wearing this ridiculous getup . Now I gotta watch while you take some fake drugs . Believe it or not , that hat is better camouflage in here than that businessman special you were scanned in . And as for this , it 's not fake , and it 's not for me . - Are you kidding me ? - What ? You 're not paying me to entertain you , counselor . Now we 've got to make it all the way across town . We could take the Lev , but in he that 's a guaranteed death sentence . No wheels , so we 're hoofing it . It 's called " amp . " Think of it as a hack that bypasses the holoband 's safeties , interacting with the visual cortex to heighten a player 's senses and reflexes . In here , you 're either quick or you 're dead . Take your pick . So how do I ... just ... You 've taken eye drops before , right ? Yeah , sure . It 's the same thing . Just hold it up close and squeeze . Okay . Now ? - Yes . - Okay . Welcome back . Sorry I had to shut you down for so long , but I was just a little stunned and flabbergasted . See , up until last night , I was convinced that my daughter 's avatar had been lost or melted or destroyed . But now I 'm convinced that you 're in there . And you 're free to talk to me . Give me a sign . Anything ? No ? Okay , so it 's not that you can 't talk to me . It 's that you won 't talk to me . I ... I ... I can 't imagine what the last few weeks have been like for you . This certainly wasn 't what you were expecting , was it ? Must have scared the crap out of you . I can understand that . I 'm sorry , but you have to understand that this was always just a temporary place just so we could get you back in our lives . And if you can 't handle it , you just let me know , and I will take you out of this and find a way to make you a more human body , whatever you want . You just ... just have to let me know . Okay ? Can you at least look at me when I 'm talking to you ? Can you look at me , please ? U87 , look at me . So ... You 'll only respond as the robot , huh ? Okay . I see . Okay , so you 're giving me the silent treatment . Okay . This might be hard on you , but it 's going to be all for the best . Don 't worry ! Just another amphead . A junkie ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . You mean the stuff you gave me was addictive ? But I thought holoband ... Were designed to be non-addictive . Right . But amp 's are like jamming a wire into your brain 's pleasure center . Okay , hey , so addictive drugs , senseless sex . It 's a heck of a game . How do you win ? It depends on who you ask . Ah , so no rules ? Sounds like a scam . Well , there 's no rule book in life , right ? You ask me , that 's what keeps it interesting . Gotta figure out for yourself what 's important . Move . I hate that thing . Just remember to keep your finger off the trigger until you 're ready to shoot . And then be ready to shoot . Oh , you 're a real-life Nicky Casino . You think this is real life ? You think this is what I look like in real life ? Wait a minute . Then who are you really ? Someone who 's being paid to help you . So keep quiet and keep alive . Great . Now do it again . You don 't mind if I smoke , do you ? Zoe hated my smoking . Actually , she hated anything at all to do with fire ever since our old house burned down . Remember that ramshackle place ? Wood beams . Wood paneling . Not the best idea when you 're working with powerful computers . Do it again . They said it started in my first-floor office , got into the walls and crept upstairs while we were sleeping . By the time I woke up , choking , the fire was , as they say , fully engaged . Do it again . Zoe was five . We had just moved her upstairs , her very first big-girl room up in the attic . She loved it up there . We could hear Zoe 's screams . But we couldn 't get past the flames on the stairs . Let 's do it again . But that sound . That sound . The flames and ... My little girl screaming . Do it again . Could hear her screams . But we couldn 't get to her , past the flames on the stairs . Do it again . I tell you , that was the longest seven minutes of my life . I can only imagine what it must have been like for her , trapped up there all alone , watching the flames climb the walls , melting all the little glow-in-the-dark stars that she glued to the ceiling . Trapped in a box of living fl ... Well ... Look at that . He had me doing all this soldier stuff , basic military crap that the robot already knew . And then he started barking orders at me like some crazy drill sergeant from one of those Tauron war movies . Doesn 't sound like much of a test . Yeah , I know . But he just kept it up , making me do things over and over again . You know , it just pissed me off so much , I wanted to reach out and snap him . What ? My God ! I 'm such a frakking idiot . Don 't you see it , Lace ? That 's exactly what he wanted me to do . He wants you to break his neck ? No , no , no , to react . He knows that I 'm never gonna admit that I 'm in the robot . So he 's trying to trick me into revealing myself . Zoe , are you still sure that it would be the worst thing if you did , you know , come out to him ? Yes . Are you kidding ? Lace , the man lied to me when he put me in the robot . If he really thought of me as his daughter , he would 've never have done the things that he did . But it doesn 't matter , because at the end of the day he just used me to save his fat military contract . Business first , same old daddy . And you know what , if I were to tell him that I was in there now , he would just use me again . Maybe in ways that were even worse . Okay , so you know what , he can 't know . Okay . Okay , so what are you gonna do ? Well , what am I supposed to do ? Follow every order no matter how stupid , refuse to I have to turn me off , just be the robot . Can you even do that anymore ? This is my place . At least it 's the game 's version of my place . It 's locked . Someone 's taken possession . Tamara ? Maybe . Try knocking . Tammy ? Tammy ! What ? Who the frak is it ? I 'm Joseph Adama . Who the frak are you ? Adama , Adama , Adama . Uh , you know , that doesn 't mean frak-all to me . - No , no . - Bye-bye . Don 't let him take his holoband off . Come here ! What is this ? No , no , let me go . Let me go . Sit down . Put your frakkin ' hands down , all right ? And don 't even think about touching your holoband . Okay , okay , you got it . Whatever you say . - All right . - All right ? - Hands down ... - You 're gonna sit down , and you 're gonna answer my questions . I got it , I got it . What the frak have you done to my place ? Clear . There 's no one else here . No , no , of course not . It 's just me . That 's ... look , you want my stash , right ? All right , you take my stash . - I don 't want any trouble . - I don 't want your drugs . I 'm looking for a young girl . Oh , well , you just should have said something in the first place , because I could get you a really sweet piece of tail . She 's my daughter , you motherfrakker . All right , look , I told you , I would absolutely help you if I could . This girl , have you seen her ? Oh , frak , yeah , yeah . This is , uh ... this is the dead girl , right ? This is the dead girl . The dead girl ? Well , yeah , I mean , that 's what all the players call her . She 's like a new part of the program , new character . You can 't kill her 'cause she 's already dead . Very bad mojo , you know ? Where can we find her ? - I don 't know . - Come on ! They said they saw her at that club . What 's it called ? Mysteries . Maybe . Mysteries . Where the hell 's it at ? What 's it to you , pops ? They just busted in , just now . They just busted in here , man . They just busted in . I 'm just looking for my daughter . And how could the dead chick be your daughter ? Doesn 't compute , ' cause she 's part of the game . Well , if you help me find her , I 'll pay you . We don 't play for the cubits , man . Your bitch-ass daughter took out two of my friends . Hey , watch your frakkin' mouth when you talk about her ! You 're not gonna have to listen to it much longer . Hey , you guys got a beef with him , just leave me out of it , all right ? I was just looking to score , and this Jagoff said he could help me . All right . Just step away . We 'll deal with you later . Sure . Absolutely . Whatever you say . Sorry , pops . I 'll be sure to say hi to your daughter , your little girl if I ... Frak you . Damn it ! Are you all right ? No , I 'm not all right . I got shot , and it frakkin ' hurts . It 's just a graze . I 'm not gonna De-rez . Now get out . What ? Get your pink newbie cheeks out of this game and don 't come back in until you 've got your frakkin ' head on straight . No , but my daugh ... I gotta get my ... Yeah , you 're no good to her if you 're gonna freeze every time some dirtbag shoves a gun in your face . I thought Taurons had bigger stones . Did the cabbie see him ? No , it was just me . Are you sure it 's the same car ? Yes , I 'm sure . It was the same car that I saw in the city wrapped around the tree the other day . Well , that 's just not possible unless , I mean ... I know , unless I 'm frakkin' nuts , right , Clarice ? No , I 'm just saying that there 's probably lots of cars out there that look like that and lots of drivers too . And I think that it was perfectly acceptable given everything that you 've been through . You know , I think it 's all really about Zoe . Did you ask Daniel about the avatar ? Yeah . He said that the code was unstable or something , that ... That it wasn 't her , that ... You know what , it 's the last thing I need anyway , is to start seeing more dead people . No . And now I feel terrible . I don 't think you should be alone . I 'm fine , really . I 'll be okay . Um , look , I 've got to go . It 's ... we 're having a barbecue . I 'll call you later . Bye . Okay , bye . Oh , look at that . It certainly is a beautiful day , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? You know what a tell is ? It 's an unconscious gesture , a look or a twitch , that gives away the strengths or the weaknesses of a cardplayer 's hands . It 's inconspicuous , but a good player knows to look for it . And you showed me yours , as much as yelled at me , " I 'm in here , daddy ! " So why are we still playing this game ? I know it 's you . But if you want to keep hiding behind a quarter ton of metal , fine . Just don 't kid yourself . Don 't think for a second it 's because of anything that I did . Because I kept my side of the bargain . I took you out of a virtual playground and brought you into the real world . But I guess you can 't handle that , huh ? However brilliant you may be . Maybe deep down inside , you 're still just the same , scared little girl that you always were . Your mother and I , we set the bar pretty high . And maybe you were scared you couldn 't measure up , so you had to condemn us . I understand that , that 's only natural , but the entire big bad adult world ? Was it really easier to blow up a train of innocent people than to face up to your own biggest fear , which , let 's face it , is life itself , isn 't it ? 'Cause life is scary and brutal and unpredictable , and you gotta make choices like that . And sometimes you make the wrong ones . Maybe I 've made some wrong choices too . But you keep moving on . And if you 're lucky , maybe you get to create something that lasts , has some meaning . I still love you . No matter what you did , no matter what ... No matter what you are , crazy as this . I know you 're not really even her . You are all of her that I have left . So please ... Talk to me . Please . All right , I didn 't want to have to do this . I know what the robot 's tolerances are . I 'm betting they exceed yours . Now if you want this to end at any time , all you 've got to do is take four steps forward . And walk out of the circle . And then I 'll know ... For a fact that it 's you . All right ? Because meanwhile ... I 'm ordering the u87 to stay . Guess you don 't knock , huh ? Stopped about the same time you stopped answering . She always signed her name like that . That 's a little flower . What the hell , let me see that . Hey . You gave the ferryman the coins , you sent her on her way . Shannon too . Tell me , Sam . What goes through your head when you kill someone ? I 'm sorry , what ? I ... How do you do what you do ? I mean , murder someone in cold blood ? Are you frakking kidding me ? What the frak kind of question is that ? How do ... Is this about the Graystone thing again ? - No ! - Because that 's done . - You 're safe . - No , please . Sam , I promise . Then what is this about ? - No , I just ... - You just what ? Forget it . You tell yourself it 's not real . Why ? Look , I 'm only telling you this because if you need to know , you better know . You tell yourself it 's not real . And then ... Then they 're not people shooting at you anymore , they 're ... targets . And the whole thing becomes just a game . Guess that 's the place , huh ? According to our junkie friend . Do you really think she 'd be here ? That 's what the junkie said . Look , there 's a stage act inside . The host fires riddles at the audience . Avoid him . Just follow my lead and be cool , okay ? Fine . Let 's go . Check your guns first . No weapons allowed in the club . Come on ! You don 't have to tell me that a good man is hard to find . But there 's got to be one brave soul amongst you who 's willing to risk the ultimate price for the possibility of the ultimate reward . An epiphany . A privileged peek into the mysteries that could show our hero how to win this crazy game . All you have to do is answer tonight 's riddle . What ? No takers ? Well , then ... How about you , sir ? What do you say , folks ? Is this stranger our new Prometheus ? Stranger , stranger , stranger . Boys ! No , no , no . Hey , hey . Take it easy , guys , come on . Listen , I 'm sorry , I don 't know what this is all about . - I just ... - Why , this is all about you . Right now . Well , I 'm just looking for someone . Aren 't we all ? I 'm ... I 'm trying to find a girl . It 's my daughter . Pretty . Wish I had her hair . Maybe we can help each other out . Answer tonight 's riddle and all will be revealed . Well , what if I don 't answer your riddle ? There 's a price for failure . But such a reward for success ! Come now , don 't you wanna find your little girl ? The sacred vessel , please . Hey ! Lay off ! " As the gods overthrew the titans , so has man overthrown the gods . But when man visits his sins upon his children , how shall he be repayed ? " Come on . Say something . - What , you didn 't hear it ? - Tick , tock , tick , tock . Um , okay ... Look , I don 't have an answer for you , I 'm just ... Won 't you even try ? The ultimate reward for the ultimate risk . No , I 'm just want to find my daughter , that 's all ! Please , folks . Tammy ? Tammy ! Baby ! Tammy , please . Pity . The stench of a coward offends me . Hey . Take him away . Get off of me . Get off of me ! Tammy ! All right , all right . Okay , let me go . Let go of me ! Don 't come back . Motherfrakkers . What 'd I say about staying cool , counselor ? You know , you 're lucky we 're both still alive . You want your gun back or not ? Oh , yeah . Hey ... Hey , who Drew that flower ? Who Drew that ? I don 't know what you 're talking about , man . That 's Tammy 's sign . She was here . You sure ? Frakking amp heads . What are you doing ? Like you said , in here , you 're either quick or you 're dead . I 'll be quick . You freeze . Anybody else wants to stay in this frakking game better clear out now . I said now ! * time after time * * it 's the same old story * Where is she ? Where 's my daughter ? Look at this place . Deader than a doornail , and on a Saturday night . Where is she ? Where 's my daughter ? You freak ! She was here . Okay ? She was here . In fact , she 's the only reason we 've been drawing a crowd all month . What ? What are you talking about ? She was right here on the stage , seeking answers to the afterlife . Came right up , unlike her daddy . When she answered the riddle wrong , we discovered she had the power to transcend life and death . It was quite a show . Maybe she 's found the answers that everyone 's searching for . Or maybe she is the answer . But if you find her ... If you find her ... Tell her I 'll give her star billing if she comes back . Hell , I 'll even pay her . Real cubits .. The game speaks through all of us differently . Changes us in ways that we can 't expect . Stick around long enough , it 'll happen to you . Let 's go . Back door . Come back anytime . Happy hour 's on Wednesdays . I don 't get it . How could she be opening secret doors in here ? What 's happening to her ? Maybe the other players are right , she is a part of this place . No . She wasn 't meant to be part of some sick game . She 's my daughter . She 's my little girl . My gods ... They 're all her signs . What 's happening to her ? Seems like your daughter has found a home . Maybe it 's time you went back to yours . Excuse me , Amanda . You have a visitor . Dr. Thomas Vergis . Vergis ? Tell him Daniel 's down in the lab . He 's asking for you . I told him you were busy , but he was very insistent . All right , show him in . Welcome , Dr. Burgess . Dr. Graystone . How can I help you ? Are you familiar with Tauron customs ? I noticed your gloves . I suspect that you 're also in mourning . Some might call it mourning , yes . Two of my employees were murdered . Beaten to death during a break-in at my plant . Oh , my gods , I didn 't know . I am so sorry . The thieves took something called an MCP . It 's a key element in a Caprican defense contract that my company 's competing for . It 's a contract for a robotic soldier . And just days later , the contract was awarded to Graystone Industries . It seems that Daniel had suddenly developed an identical MCP of his own . Well , look at that . Caesar really likes you . Tell you what . We 'll do one more test . And then we 'll call it a day . Scanner up . Now here 's the deal ... I love my dog . But I love my daughter even more . And if there 's even a slight chance that some small part of her is tangled up in your alloy skeleton , I 've got to know . Are you trying to say that my husband stole your MCP and murdered those people ? No . Not personally , no . He doesn 't have the courage for that . This is my husband that you 're talking about . If you knew him , you would know that this is not even remotely possible . The question is is do you know him ? I don 't give a frak who you think my husband killed . He 's my husband . Get out of my house . So ... U87 , take the gun . And I 'm gonna count to five . And I want you ... To shoot the dog . One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... Five . You didn 't miss . They were blanks . U87 , shut yourself down . Sweetheart ? On . I can 't believe it . He actually made you shoot Caesar ? With blanks . The funny thing is ... As soon as I picked up the gun , I knew . The robot knew . The weight was off by a tiny fraction , quarter rounds instead of full . Well , thank gods . You wanna know something ? If they were full ... I might 've pointed the gun at him . Zoe , he 's your father . At least he 's ... yeah . Get me out of here , Lace . Before I do something I really regret .

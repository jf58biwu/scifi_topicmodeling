 Terra Nova H.Q. , this is Foster . Terra Nova command , copy that . I just pulled up at communications relay station 19-A . - Man : Copy that . Commence repair . - Roger that . Terra Nova Command out . ( Loud clattering ) Smithson , is that you ? You sleeping off another bender in there , or did you lock yourself in again ? ( Distant roaring ) ( Beeping ) Smithson , wake up . Smithson ? ( Screaming ) ( Snarling ) Yeah , it looks pretty straightforward what happened here to me . Foster made the mistake of leaving the shed door open while he was working . Must have snuck up behind him . Never saw it coming . What did it to him ? Nykoraptor . The bite Marks on his torso were a dead giveaway . They 've got three rows of incisors . Nykos are vicious . Basically two-legged sharks . Easy with him . Jim : Do they hunt around here ? No , no , not usually . But these Ankylosaur nests ... Their eggs are easy prey . Jim : With easy prey nearby , why 'd the Nyko go after a human ? You got an endless supply of chicken ... Doesn 't mean you 're going to turn your nose up at a bloody rare steak . Good morning , Josh . I need to talk to you for a sec about our arrangement . There 's been a complication . It 's about your girl . Kara ? We had a deal . You told me you could get her here on one of the next pilgrimages . Like I said , there 's been a complication . Now if you want me to get her here , you 're going to have to do something . I 'm listening . You might want a shot of courage first . Hey . - Hi . - Good morning . What brings you to my end of the compound ? Oh , well , Jim asked me to autopsy this soldier that was killed . See if anything out of the ordinary turned up . - I won 't distract you . - Okay . ( Whistles ) Amazing . Just amazing . Ankylosaurus . Where 'd you get it ? In a nest near the scene of the accident . Oh , wow , looks pretty damaged . The others had hatched . This one , unfortunately , didn 't make it . But it is an incredible research opportunity . I 'd say so . - Hey , babe . - Hey . Hey , Zoe . Why aren 't you at school ? Well , her teacher sent for me . Somebody has an earache . Oh . And yesterday it was your tummy , wasn 't it ? I just miss you , mommy . I know you do , sweetheart , but school is really important . Look , I need to just have a quick word with daddy . So why don 't you go and take a look at some of that cool stuff over there . Just be careful not to touch anything , all right ? Go on . The autopsy turn up anything ? Yeah , I was just in the middle of something when you came in . Great . So I found two types of blood on Foster 's torso . One was his . And the second 's probably from the Nyko . Yes , that 's what I was thinking . Hmm , it says the second type of blood came from one of those . I don 't understand . I think I do . Malcolm . What 's a Nykoraptor 's favorite food ? You 're looking at it . It 's a Galesaur . Sort of a prehistoric Turkey . Why ? I think this was a murder . Help me out here . How do you kill a man with a dinosaur ? You trap it somewhere where you know the victim 's going to show up . All you need is the right bait and knowledge of your Vic 's schedule . We found blood from the bait that was used to lure the Nyko inside the shed . And the back of that door was covered in scratches from when it was trying to get out . We 've lost our share of folks , but never like this . Not to murder . Foster was a good soldier . If somebody killed him , I want to know who . Find out . Do it quick and do it quiet . Wash , you 're on this with him . First thing , we should talk to his friends . A day like today , I think I know where they 'll be . - Boys . - Lieutenant . Hi , Mr. Shannon . Hey . Sorry about Foster . And I 'm sorry to interrupt you guys . I know this isn 't a good time , but I 've got a few questions I need to ask if that 's okay ? Sure . Did Foster get along with everyone in your unit ? Uh , pretty much . Why ? Can you think of anyone who would have wanted to harm him ? Hold on , you 're investigating this as a murder or something ? I don 't believe this . You know , Foster was seeing a woman . - Yeah ? What 's her name ? - I don 't know . None of us do . He never told us who she is . Yeah , but he was always up in his bunk looking at pictures of her on his tag . I thought they only held personal info and blood type . Yeah , plus a medical history and a locator . You 're not supposed to , but everyone hacks in and throws a couple of pictures of loved ones on there . Maybe some music for when you 're holed up someplace or on a long patrol . Well , thanks , gentlemen , - and again , sorry for your loss . - Yeah . You find it odd that this mystery woman hasn 't stepped forward ? Now you 're getting the hang of this . So let 's go take a look at Foster 's tag . Foster 's personal effects ... Can we , uh , can we see them ? Well , yeah . Could you get me the deceased 's - personal effects , please ? - Right away . Thanks . What 's going on ? Well , Foster had a dog tag ... Be careful ! Be , be very careful with that . Gently , sweetheart . Sorry . Zoe : It 's broken . Are you trying to fix it ? ( Gasps ) The baby wants to come out . Malcolm : My God , it 's still alive ! It 's unbelievable . You 're going to help it , right ? Um ... Yeah , of course we are , sweetheart , yeah . - Here you go . - Thanks . OK . Foster 's personal effects . Terra 's , a flashlight . Washington : But the tag wasn 't recovered . You said it has a locator . ( Beeping ) - It 's on the move . - Yeah . A Nyko must have eaten it . Then we 're going to have to go get that Nyko . ( Snarling ) Shannon , you copy ? Copy . You two have eyes on the Nyko ? Negative , sir . We lost it . Stand by . ( Animal chittering ) Contact ! Eyes on target , 9 : 00 ! 20 meters ! Good . Flank him to the right . Swing him back towards me . Coming your way . All right , up ahead is the choke point . It dead-ends in dense forest . Force it into the shooting gallery . We got you now . ( Loud chittering ) Anybody got a visual ? No joy , sir . All right , just so we 're clear ... We 're not killing this thing , right ? No need . Whatever we get out of its belly , we 're going to obtain on site . Lieutenant Washington there is about the finest combat medic I 've ever had the pleasure to be stitched up by , isn 't that right , lieutenant ? If you say so , sir . How many stitches you put in my side that time ? - 67 , sir . - Yeah . ( Growling ) Where 'd it go ? How long can he stay up there ? You got somewhere you need to be , lieutenant ? I 'd love not to be here when the sun sets . How long can he stay up there ? ( Roaring ) - We got him . - Open him up . This was the bait . Ugh . And , uh , this is what else he ate when he was in the shed . And here 's what we came for . Foster 's tag . It 's pretty banged up . Taylor : There he is , and he 's with a woman , but I don 't think I know her . We can run a facial rec against our database . Damn it to hell . It 's okay , sir . I recognize her . She works at the mess hall . Yeah , I know Foster . Hmm . I know you , too . Working in the mess , I meet my share of soldiers . Well , his friends seem to think it was , um ... more than that . I was nice to him . Support staff , it 's our job to be nice . I 'm sorry if he took it the wrong way . Look at this . Terra Nova lottery notification . How long you guys been married ? Three years . And was the wedding before or after he ... got this ? Hmm . So what happened ? You loved him until he got you through the portal , then you traded up for another man ? I mean , I 'm just spitballing here . I 'm a married woman . You can 't just come in here and make accusations . ( Door opens ) Honey ? Jim : Afternoon , Mr. Milner . I 'm Jim Shannon from security . This is lieutenant Washington . Why are you here ? It 's about the soldier who died , Ken Foster . It 's nothing , Howard . They 're just asking some questions . Yeah . Are you okay , Mr. Milner ? You-you seem upset . I 'm fine . 'Cause your wife knew this man Foster from the mess hall . Of course I do ; I serve these guys every day . Look , I told them this already . I don 't know what the hell they 're still doing here . Shut up . Just shut up . Do you think I didn 't know ? Do you think I 'm a fool ? Well , you 're here , right ? You 're gonna find out sooner or later . I killed that son of a bitch Foster . And given the chance , I 'd kill him again . Hey . I just dropped Zoe back at school . All she could talk about was this egg . Please give me some good news . Well , I wish I could . It looks like the reason it didn 't hatch with the others is that it has birth defects . - You see this dark patch here ? - Yeah . Its front right leg is fused to its neck , which has compromised its windpipe and its blood flow . And if it were to hatch now , it wouldn 't get nearly enough oxygen . Wouldn 't survive three minutes . The mother must 've had to abandon it - to care for the other hatchlings . - Yes . And I 'm afraid we have to abandon it , too . Oh , no , that 's not gonna work for me . You saw the look on her face . No , there must be something we can do to help it along . I don 't know yet . Um ... in Ovo surgery through the shell if we have to . ( Sighs ) There 's gotta be something . Jim : When did you find out that your wife was having an affair ? Milner : I just did ; Who cares when ? ( Slamming ) I do . The shed ... How 'd you get it open ? Anything with a circuit board can be hacked . But how 'd you know his shifts ? That he 'd be the one to get the call ? Well , I tailed him for a week . That night I went out and broke the piece of equipment that caused the repair beacon to sound . I tied up some bait inside the shed . Then I waited in the rover until the Nykoraptor came . When it went after the bait , I closed the door behind it , and then I drove away . ( Sighs ) Very elaborate . I mean , you must , you must really love this woman . ( Voice breaking ) : With all my heart . You can 't imagine what is like winning the lottery . Maybe you both had love in your lives , maybe not . But I haven 't . And then all of a sudden there was a flood of it . And the best thing to come along was Rebecca . And it was perfect . You know , coming back to a world like this ... How could she not love me for bringing her here ? ( Sighs ) Milner ( On-screen ) : How could I have been so stupid ? Why didn 't I see that she was using me ? But you know what the stupidest thing of all was ? Thinking that it could actually be different for me this time . ( Video stops ) You were right . It was murder . Lieutenant Washington knows I expect my people to adhere to a strict code of honor . For one of them to get involved with a married Terra Novan , well ... That 's not just frowned upon , I won 't tolerate it . But Foster didn 't deserve to die for it . Shannon , have you been out to memorial field ? Uh ... Not yet . It 's beyond the fields before those low hills . Simple headstones buried in the Earth . We have sustained losses ... Fallen soldiers , accidents , citizens who succumbed to syncillic fever . But we 've never had a murder in Terra Nova . Unless I commute Milner 's sentence to imprisonment , the bylaw says banishment . - Out there ? - Out there . I 'm going to go bury our soldier . And I 'm going to make a decision . I don 't recall ever having to make a tougher one . Josh : So Boylan said if I want to get Kara here , I have to meet with someone . - It 's outside the gates . - Why can 't you just meet at the bar ? It 's Mira . Leader of the Sixers , Mira ? Is there another one ? 'Cause if there is , it 'd be pretty awesome if I just misunderstood this whole thing . You can 't go . There 's no telling what she might be up to . - I don 't have a choice . - Yes , you do . Look , I know you promised Kara , but it 's not worth getting yourself killed . You have no idea what 2149 is like . I had three friends junior year that killed themselves . Nobody believes they have a future . Nobody believes in anything anymore . Nothing means anything . I have to get her out of there . ( Sighs ) Okay . But you 're not going alone . ♪ It was quite moving today . - Sad . - Mm . The procession . Everyone in the streets . Can you imagine that back in Chicago ? No . Honestly , it felt like something from another time we 've only ever read about . So what do you think will happen tomorrow ? I don 't know , but the good news is , there 's not gonna be a drawn-out trial . You don 't think he deserves one ? He confessed . There 's something to be said for swift justice . But , Jim , come on , this is wrong . It 's frontier justice ; You know that . You say that like it 's a bad thing , like I should miss the system we left behind . You remember the crap I dealt with . Everything moved iceberg slow , and I 'd work a good case for months only to have someone buy the verdict out from under me . Yeah , I know , I know that was bad , but I fail to see how it 's worse than barbaric decisions being made by one man alone . - Barbaric ? - Yeah . Okay . Don 't forget Milner 's a confessed killer . What do you think we should do with him ? Confine him . Put him on trial . And if he 's guilty , then put him in prison , but try to show some mercy . I was just in prison . And " mercy " is not the first word that comes to mind when I think back on my time . Maybe we should talk about this later . If someone had given me the choice between an eight-by - eight in goladand and a chance in the wild with a gun in my hand , I know which one I would 've picked . Okay , I didn 't think before I spoke , all right ? I didn 't mean it that way . Maybe ... I 'm trying to take this back ! What do you want from me , Liz ? I mean , I got a confession . You 're acting like I beat it out of the guy . Jim ... ( Sighs ) I 'm sorry . Like no one 's ever had reason to falsely confess ? Hey . I 'm sorry about Foster . Thanks . Let 's hope the guy that did this gets banished like he deserves . Sorry , I , uh ... I know it sounds harsh . No . Look , I know you want justice for your friend , but whatever happens , it 's a really sad day for the colony . I mean , this place is supposed to be a new beginning . ( Sighs ) And I guess I shouldn 't be surprised that some of the old problems followed us here . ( Murmuring ) Howard Milner , you 've confessed to the murder of Ken Foster . Do you have anything else to say for yourself ? Ours is a colony of laws . A violation such as murder is a crime against every one of us . Terra Nova cannot survive unless we hold ourselves ... hold each other ... To standards higher than our standards of the past . With a heavy heart ... I carry out this judgment of banishment . Taylor ! You know this is a death sentence . Isn 't there another way ? The only way is forward , for the good of the colony . What we 're building here ... There 's no place for a crime like this . Just as we 've come back to remake this world , we have to let this world remake us . If we can 't dare to live lives that are worthy of this remarkable place , well , we should have just stayed in the future to perish with the planet . Milner , you have a fighting chance out there . That 's more than you gave Ken Foster . Don 't ever come back to the colony . You 've made your own fate . Now live or die with it . ( Dinosaur trilling ) ( Cawing ) Hey ! Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - What are you doing here ? - Take it easy . Just put the weapon down . ( Dinosaur snarling ) So . How you doing out here so far ? I would be scared out of my mind . I mean , between the wildlife and the Sixers , there 's a lot of ways to die in this jungle . Well , I ... I deserve what I get . I gotta admit , I was surprised when Taylor went through with the sentence . Seemed like a lot of people were . What about you ? Were you ... Were you surprised ? We have a law . He followed it , so ... No . ( Screeches ) Not sure I believe you , Howard . I think you were surprised . I think you were betting on Taylor commuting the sentence . I mean , it would have been a lot easier to be the hero in a colony jail than it is out here . The hero ? What are you talking about ? Well , I saw the way you and Rebecca were looking at each other back there , and it got me thinking . I mean , what if she killed Foster ? I know you 're crazy about her . The question is , are you crazy enough to fall on your sword for her when it means facing this jungle alone ? What do you want ? Howard ! I 'm sorry . I couldn 't go through with it . Go through with what ? I know Foster broke things off with you a couple of weeks ago . So , isn 't that why you did it ? Did what ? Hang on , what ... you ... You think I killed him ? What ... ? So , you didn 't ? Of course not ! ( Sighs ) Is that why you confessed ? Well , I ... I didn 't want you sent out there to die alone . So , Howard , when you confessed to me , how did you know what to say ? I 'd heard the details of the crime flying around the colony . Whoever killed Foster clearly had a reason to spread them . But Rebecca ... Foster did end it with you , right ? To be honest , I was happy that he did . I 'm better off without him . Why is that ? He turned out to be a jerk . He chose his friends , and his drinking , and his gambling over me . Gambling ? It was all he cared about . He was always over at Boylan 's playing cards . There 's quite a scene over there . But it 's illegal , so people stay pretty quiet about it . Hmm . Just what exactly were you thinking , Shannon ? Look , you told me to do my job , and I did . Milner recanted his confession . Well , how do you know he didn 't just take it back 'cause he got scared to death out there ? My gut 's telling me . Oh . Oh , well , why didn 't you say so ? Commander , let me explain . No , you let me explain . Banishing Milner , I put a huge chunk of my reputation on the line . You saw as well as I did , not everybody was overjoyed with my decision to stick to the letter of the law on this , and now you tell me that I got the wrong guy ? But he 's alive . And I got a new lead . So if we keep the Milner return under wraps just long enough for me to follow it ... You do exactly that . 'Cause your gut 's not good enough on this . You follow that new lead . Otherwise , I guarantee you I am bouncing Milner 's ass right back outside that gate . Rotate ten degrees . Stop . There we go . Almost there . Amazing . Shame Jim couldn 't be here to see you work your magic . Well , surgery 's not really a spectator sport . Well , with you holding the knife , it should be . You 're very sweet , but ... I 'm sure Jim has many more important things to do today than watch me attempt to alter nature 's course . Okay . Uh ... Foster 's financials . I 've got them right here . Whoa , whoa . Looks like Rebecca was right about what goes on at Boylan 's . That is interesting . Look who owed Foster a lot of money . Okay . Let 's take it to Taylor . He 's going to want a real confession this time . Yeah . And I know how to get it . Mr. sheriff ! Welcome back . And Commander Taylor . Now , what a pleasure . You never darken my door . - Josh ? - Hi , dad . What are you doing here ? I work here . Boylan : We 're very impressed with your boy . Josh has already proven himself a very worthy member of the team . We 'll talk about that , you bet your ass , but first things first . Boylan , I been looking forward to saying this for a long time . We 're taking you in . - Yes sir . - What are you doing ? - On your feet . - Come on . You nuts ? You have never made a bigger mistake in your life , Taylor . Curran : Okay , get up ! Let 's go ! Walk with me ! Taylor : The long and the short of it is this , Boylan : You 're going to come clean about gambling at your place , or I might have to shut you down . Oh , Commander . Your loyal subjects would just love that . I created the one place in Terra Nova that operates just outside your grip . Close my shop , and see how people respond when you take that away . You run card games . And we know you take a cut . Are there card games that take place under my roof ? Yeah . Do I take a small percentage off the top ? Well ... Define small . Now , is that unreasonable ? No . No , it is not . Foster played at your shop , didn 't he ? Yeah . So ? Well , you don 't think I killed him . - Jim : Did you ? - No . Why would I ? Same reason you do everything . Money . See , Boylan , colony financials told us something good , but ... Well , we dug deeper and found something even better . You keep offline financial records . Old-school . On , on paper . And they 're going to tell us everything we need to know about you and Ken Foster . Bar 's closed . You , too . Get out . Get some air . Josh , come here . I want you to check behind the bar , in the back room , every inch . That ledger 's here somewhere . Find it . Yes , sir . Today 's your last day , buddy . You 're not working here . Yes , I am . No , no . There 's no discussion . You 're always on me about taking responsibility , and then all of a sudden you don 't approve of the job I get ? No , it 's not just that this is a bar . It 's that you should have talked to me and your mother first . Why ? So you could just shoot it down ? Either I 'm supposed to be an adult here , or I 'm not . You better get your stories straight . Tore the place apart . If he 's got that ledger , it definitely isn 't here . Boylan ran . And he had help . Let 's go . Move it out ! Let 's go ! Wash , you copy ? Washington : Copy . I want you and Reynolds to check the security logs . I want to know who helped that scum . Command out . You got anything on the scanner ? Yeah , life up ahead . Hang on , sir . Signal stopped moving , sir . Curran : We 're closing in on the signal . Right up ahead . Wash , what 's the status on that security cam ? Nothing yet . I 'm still scanning . Taylor : Copy that . Taylor out . Curran : This is supposed to be the spot . Signal 's coming from right here . Boylan ! Well , maybe the scanner 's busted . If I were a betting man , I 'd say he 's not here . You a betting man , Jim ? No , I am not . But , Curran ... You are . What are you talking about ? The money you owe Foster . Your account 's been tapped . Last four transactions all payments made to Foster . How much more did you owe him , son ? How much couldn 't you pay him ? You 're way off , sir . Hmm . Now , you look me in the eye and you tell me you didn 't kill Foster . I didn 't . I didn 't kill him . You 're lying . Prove it . I don 't have to . I know you did it . I can tell . The Boylan arrest was staged ? Yeah . So , why 'd you bring me out here ? Couldn 't we have just done this inside the gates ? No . ( Gun clicking empty ) You didn 't think I 'd give you a live one ? It 's over . ( Groaning ) One of my soldiers kills one of our own ? I should separate your head from your shoulders ! ( Groaning ) You didn 't kill Foster ? You didn 't kill Foster ? - Huh ? ! - No ! Then why 'd you steal this from the bar , huh ? Except to hide the fact that you owed Foster money . You 're staying here . You can 't do this . I can , and I am . No ! Are you out of your mind ? ! You can 't prove I did anything . We-we 're going back , and I get a court-martial . You just had one . Start walking . With nothing ? No . Sir , come on . Well , you gave Milner a gun . You can 't send me out there with nothing ! Okay . I 'm going . ( Spits ) I 'm going . You think he 'll survive out there on his own ? I did . It can be done . Whatever happens , I 'm not gonna lose any sleep over it . ( Dinosaur bellowing in distance ) ( Dinosaur roaring ) Taylor : Hell of a thing . Him taking a fall like that for her . And him taking her back . If that ain 't love . ( Vehicle approaching ) Hey , Boylan , thanks for playing along today . You know , that 's the first and last time I do a favor for you for free . And here I was starting to think you might actually be good for something . That man does not like you . You could die trying to please everybody . ( Playing bluesy music ) Sounds good . Where is everybody ? Uh , Zoe wanted to go and watch the egg hatch , so mom took her over there . Maddy called it an early night . Okay , and what are you still doing here ? Aren 't you late for work ? Are you serious ? Look , uh , I would have liked for you to have talked to us before taking this job , but guess you 're old enough now to start making your own decisions . Stay out of trouble over there . And , Josh , in this family , no secrets . ( Sighs ) My dad changed his mind . As long as you can pay me , the deal 's back on . What the hell 's she doing here ? She 's not gonna tell anyone ; She just wants to help . Oh , great . Well , there 's a stack of dirty dishes back at the bar . Look , how much do you trust Mira ? I don 't . But I 've been told I have issues . Okay , well , you send him OTG in the middle of the night and he doesn 't come back , that 's bad for everyone . You know he stands a better chance with me . Okay , you 're meeting just outside the perimeter mines , so you should be safe from predators . But just in case , take this . Follow this map exactly , and you 'll get to the rendezvous point . Then what ? Then you pray Mira likes surprises better than I do . ( Dinosaur roaring ) Should be just up ahead . Okay . Hey , whoa . I 'm not going in there blind . This way . Where are they ? Behind those rocks . ( Screams ) Ok . I didn 't ask for her . You 're right , you should probably just turn her loose . - I 'm not going anywhere . - Mira : Enough ! You 're the cop 's kid . Or Josh . But " the cop 's kid " works . For Boylan to work his magic , get your girl here , he 's got to be able to talk to 2149 . Which means he 's got to go through me . You want money , too , is that it ? Not money . But someday I 'm gonna ask you to do something for me . And when that day comes , you 'll comply without question . Without hesitation . Do we have a deal ? Yes . Yes . Take them back to where you found them and point them home . - ( Whispers ) : Hey . - Shh ! Anything yet ? No , still waiting . Where 's Malcolmus ? He went home . ( Eggshell crackling ) ( Groaning weakly ) You did it , mommy . Very gently , very gently . Can we keep him ? Can we ? Just for a little while ?

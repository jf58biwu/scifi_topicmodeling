 Yamigedo is trying to evolve into an even more terrible entity ! New enemies are gathering around him . Fight on , Buddy Police ! Together with the Omni Lords ! Now 's the time to Buddyfight ! Ganger ! Jack ! You won 't be able to pull any more punches . Leave here quietly ! Or else I will tear apart your bodies , limb from limb ... And devour you ! Why you ... ! We are those that protect Variable Cord ! Those who oppose Variable Cord will be eliminated ! Akision ! Commencing operations ! Wait a moment . I have no right to complain about that blow . Star of Hope ! Radiant Guardian , Jackknife " Aster " ! Why hasn 't Jack received maintenance ? It looks like I need to explain it all from the very beginning . Thanks to Star Guardian Jackknife 's abilities , we jumped through time to the distance future . But when we arrived ... What is this place ? It 's definitely Earth . That 's ... It can 't be ! Cho-Tokyo Sky Tower . Technically , we managed to achieve our goal . But in this era , there is no Earth . No , not just Earth . Dragon , Danger , Magic , Katana . None of the worlds exist . They don 't exist ? The only thing that exists in this era is a world of chaos , where all of the parallel worlds are intermingled . Dragon World never became Star Dragon World , and instead became a part of this world . So that 's why Jack hasn 't received his maintenance ! Star Dragon World doesn 't exist . Thus , it 's not possible . That 's crazy ! Um , I don 't really understand what 's going on ... What created this chaotic place with all the different worlds mixed together in the first place ? It 's Yamigedo 's doing . Variable Cord ! Look , over there ! I understand now ... This is a world in which Yamigedo was never sealed . If I 'm in the future , that means the eight Omni Lords would be unable to gather on Earth in the past ... Thus , the attempt to re-seal Yamigedo would fail ... And as a result ... So this world of chaos was born through Yamigedo 's power ! I 'm sure that 's why all of the monsters have turned into Hundred Demons . In the first place , the Hundred Demons were born when Yamigedo ran wild eons ago . Wait ! I feel like I just heard something really important I can 't ignore ! You just said that we didn 't gather all eight Omni Lords together on Earth in the past ... Yes . After all , I 'm Sixth Omni Storm Lord , Variable Cord . This clearly frivolous skinny dude is a great Omni Lord ? Those are some harsh words . But he has no right to call himself an Omni Lord ! This world was created because he abandoned his mission to re-seal Yamigedo , and ... Yes , it 's my fault for trying to return to Star Dragon World . But now we can return to the past ! Right now , Star Guardian Jackknife isn 't capable of doing a time jump . And so , I used his ability and sent a tachyon transmission to the past . But I never thought you 'd actually come here and rescue us ! Mister Octopus ! Thanks ! If we return to the past and seal Yamigedo ... This world of chaos will never be born . The future that we know so well , where Star Dragon World exists , will come ! Chu ! Takochu ! What 's wrong , Takosuke ? Takochu ... What ? What 's wrong ? T-Takosuke 's mothership , the one we used to get here ... He says there was only enough energy for a one-way trip ! What ? One-way ? That means ... We can 't go back to the past ! Chu ... Wh-What ? We can 't go back to the past ? That 's ... Takochu ... I 'm sorry . There 's no need for you two to apologize . I 'll be by Jack 's side . You should get some rest . Okay ... This is ... A Dark Core Deck Case ? Oh , yes . It belongs to Vice President Sophia , I mean , former Vice President ... Where is she ? Actually , after you fell ... Master Tasuku ! Don 't come any closer ! Gree ... I 'm hungry ! I cast ! Breathen Gard ! That hurts , gree ! I 'm angry ! That girl has a weird power , woof ! If we take her to Boss Gratos , we might get a reward , bow wow ! Did you say Gratos ? Is he here ? Woof ! Bow wow ! Gree ! I won 't let you steal my prize , gree ! Gratos ? Yes . It sounded like she knew that person . Gratos ! Do you really not remember me ? Who do you think you 're talking to ? Call me Master Gratos ! Master ! I had no idea you had such a lovely acquaintance . You 're one smooth operator . Even though you have a face like a skull . You 're one to talk ! Is this really the same Gratos ? You know where Gratos is ? Over there . If that 's true , Sophia is there too . Master Tasuku ! Don 't tell me you 're going to rescue the former Vice President ? Yes . Oh , you 're so wonderful ! Even though you have no idea what dangers await you ... Takochu ! It 's just as she says . You 've fought for her once before . Do you have some special feelings for her ? N-No , I can 't let that go without a fight ! Master Tasuku , I thought I was your special someone ! What 's the deal here ? Besides , isn 't former Vice President Sophia your enemy ? I save people , even if they 're my enemy . That 's what I decided long ago . Oh , you 're the king of awesome ! Takochu ? Who 's that lurking there , hey ? Future Force ! Release ! As I feared , it 's not working . What ? What kind of trick is this , hey ? Stop right there , hey ! The Future Force is a power that comes from my future self . Right now , I 'm much further in the future . So I don 't exist anymore . But the Dark Core Deck Case can make the power of the cards into reality ! I 'll be using this ! Disaster Force , activate ! Star Saber , Asteroid ! If you don 't want to get hurt ... get out of my way ! What is it ? Tasuku Ryuenji ! I 've come to save you . Don 't be ridiculous ! I cast ! Barracal Barret ! That trick might fool a child , but it won 't work on us . Miserable Bringer ! Evil Right ! Hades Cutter ! Tasuku ! Star Blade Terminate ! Jack ! You mustn 't come out ! This is ... The Gargantua Punisher that Gao gave me ! Young man of destiny . I will give you the star of hope , which will open a path through this hopeless future . Jack ! Tasuku ? You can see ? Yes ! I feel power ... Overflowing power like I 've never felt before ! Now I can fight alongside you ! Jack ! Enough fooling around ! Oh no ! At this rate , Jack will ... ! It 's an all-or-nothing gamble , but if I 'm going to distract them from Jack ... ! It looks like you guys have too much time on your hands . Then , would you be interested in joining me for a Buddyfight ? Buddyfight ? Have you guys heard of it ? The countless years must have robbed them of their memories of Buddyfight ... Wait a second ... He must be talking about this . I remember it fondly . That 's right . Buddyfight ! I loved it so much . I had fun in those days ! You lot , join me ! Jack ! You too ! This is ... ! He 's going to Buddyfight ! His opponent ! Could it be ? That 's First Knight of the Apocalypse , Gratos . Ban ! Ricky ! Yo , Gao ! Second Omni , Seventh Omni , it 's been a while . Oh , it 's you , Fourth Omni . Burn Nova , wasn 't it ? What are you doing here ? I just happened to be riding below , and then I noticed this ship above my head . That 's how it is , kii ! Gather , all elite warriors of the future ! Radiant Evolution , Luminize ! Release the deep abyss of the Apocalypse , which swallows even the darkness ! Luminize ! Apocalypse Knights ! Buddyfight ! Raise the flag ! Star Dragon World ! Darkness Dragon World ! First move goes to Master Tasuku , who inflicts 2 damage with Geocorona before his move ends . Meanwhile , Gratos calls Third Knight of Apocalypse , Aberrucia to the left . Second Knight , Voremos to the center . Fourth Knight , Thanatos to the right . Three size 1 Dark Knight Attribute monsters ! Aberrucia ! Destroy Geocorona ! Evil Right ! Master ! Aberrucia can inflict 1 damage when he destroys an enemy monster while there 's a Dark Knight on the field ! Voremos ! Attack the fighter ! Miserable Bringer ! Thanatos ! Follow him ! Hades Cutter ! The Move End . Master Tasuku calls to the left , Sphere Cemetery , Star Remnant ! And to the right , he Buddy calls Star Guardian , Jackknife ! Buddy Gift gives him 1 life . Crossnize ! Dragonarms , loading ! Role Shift , Variant Form ! All Device Engaged , FCS Active ! Load , Finished ! Artirailgun ! I pay 1 gauge and 1 life and equip Star Saber , Asteroid ! Here we go , Jack ! All right ! Gratos has lost Voremos and Thanatos , but it 's Gratos 's move once more ! I cast ! Accel End ! I gain 1 gauge ! I Buddy call myself to the center ! Wh-Wh-What 's this ? It 's finally time for the leader to take the stage ! I 'll use the Takoscope to check and check ! First Knight of the Apocalypse , Gratos . His attributes are Dark Knight and Deep , and he 's size 2 . 7000 power , 2000 defense , and a critical of 3 ! Whoa ! 5 cards from the drop zone were added to Gratos ' soul ! What 's this ? When First Knight of the Apocalypse , Gratos is on the field , he can put up to 3 Dark Knight cards in his soul ... Didn 't he just add 5 cards ? Look closer . It says , if this card is your Buddy monster , you can add up to another 2 cards to its soul , kii ! That 's one major league surprise ! Aberrucia . Attack Star Remnant ! I cast ! Barracal Barret ! Fire on Aberrucia ! Then ... ! He 's down to 3 life already . But his move ended , and Jack is fine ! I activate my ability ! Destruction Fang ! Take your frustration out on my prey ! Destruction Fang returns cards from the soul to the bottom of the deck , and can destroy a monster if its size is smaller than the number of those cards ! That 's crazy ! Disarm ! Jack revived thanks to Soulguard , but a second Destruction Fang puts him down for good ! Star Remnant ! Attack Gratos ! No , Senior Tasuku ! And Destruction Fang is activated a third time ! Star Remnant has been destroyed as well ! How dare you do that to Jack ! I cast ! Midnight Shadow ! Amazing ! He 's blocked it with a Counter Spell ! It 's your move , Gratos ! Gratos , with his critical of 3 , approaches ! Master Tasuku has 3 life left . Is this the end ? Begone from my sight ! I cast ! Earth Barrier ! He managed to survive . But thanks to an attack from Thanatos , who was called earlier , he 's down to 2 life , kii . I won 't lose . I have hope , in the form of Jack ! Draw ! Charge and draw ! This card is ... ! Dear Tasuku . As long as you wish to save people , I will be your hope . I will guide you , as a star of hope ! Your Gargantua Punisher has given me new powers . Thank you , Gao . This is all thanks to you . I call to the right , Radiant Guardian , Jackknife " Aster " ! Radiant Guardian ... Jackknife Aster ? Wh-What ? It 's Jack , with golden wings ! I call Dragonarms , Radiant Alma to the left ! Crossnize ! Dragonarms , loading ! Role Shift , Variant Form ! All Device Engaged , FCS Active ! Load , Finished ! Almarsaber ! I activate Radiant Alma 's ability ! Attack the center ! Almarsaber ! The center is open ! Double Attack the fighter ! All right ! Since when does Jack have Double Attack ? The ability belongs to Radiant Alma , who he crossnized with . How dare you ... I cast ! Guillotine Cutter ! Is he trying to destroy Star Saber , Asteroid ? It 's no use ! As long as Jackknife Aster is on the field , the items I equip cannot be destroyed by effects ! Furthermore , that effect applies to Jack as well ! Wh-What ? Now Gratos is down to 4 life ! Is it coming ? Is it gonna happen ? Is it happening for real ? Final phase ! I cast ! The light that cuts a path to the future ! Edge of the soaring star ! Impact ! Radiant Punisher ! Game End . Winner , Tasuku Ryuenji . Yeah ! He did it ! If you lose , you lose everything . What are you talking about ? An old memory . That 's right . I rule over victory and conquest . The First Knight of the Apocalypse ! You 're the one who 's going to lose everything ! If you lose , you lose everything . He just proved his own point . Now , let 's go back . A chaotic future , huh ... It 's a fitting place for me to conquer . If Jack 's taken on a new form ... That means he 'll definitely be able to come back ! It 's going to take nearly ten thousand years ? In order to travel this far through time , I need to store that much energy . I used up all of my energy coming here . Do something with that Disaster Force of yours . It 's impossible . It was destroyed by Gratos . If only we had a Dark Core , we could solve our problems with the Disaster Force . We have one . There 's no mistaking it . It 's a Dark Core ! Why do you have one of those ? It 's something passed down from our great ancestors in the 21st century ! From the 21st century ? Your ancestors ? Now that I look at them more closely , these two look just like Master Tasuku and the former Vice President ! Don 't tell me ... Could the ancestors from the 21st century be you two ? No way , that 's not possible ! For their sakes as well ... I will help re-seal Yamigedo and change the future ! The Eight Omni Lords ? It couldn 't be ... To the distant past ! Let 's go ! Professor Tasuku 's Buddy Police Lessons ! Today , we 'll learn about Radiant Guardian , Jackknife Aster ! All right ! This Jack card has gone to the future and become the most powerful protector ! As long as Jackknife Aster is on the field , the fighter 's items can 't be destroyed , and the fighter doesn 't receive any damage from effects or spells . For real ? Furthermore , when Jack is crossnized , he can 't be destroyed by any effects or spells ! Wow , he 's gold ! Stay gold , Jack ! Sophia 's power awakens the monster sleeping in Cho-Hodaka ! Kiri stops his rampage , but ... ! Next episode : Rouga vs. Eighth Omni Deity Lord , Grangadez ! Join us for a Buddyfight !

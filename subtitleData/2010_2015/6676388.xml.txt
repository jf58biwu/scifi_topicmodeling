Thank you . MAN : We 've been made to understand that you have somewhat of an expertise in terms of that neighborhood . Yeah , I know it pretty well . And who are we ? Major Reno . U.S. Army . - Pleasure . - MAYOR : Detective , there 's a situation that demands the best of the best . RENO : Last night , a government transport traveling at a time and route with minimal civilian traffic was hijacked . What were they transporting ? NAD . Neutron assisted device . A neutron bomb . We prefer the word " device . " Bomb has such negative connotations . The device was fitted with an anti-theft mechanism which is triggered ... ( HISSES ) if the case should be opened the wrong way . ( BEEPING ) COMPUTER : Device activated . What the fuck ? We need you to infiltrate , locate the device , and contact us for the code to disarm it . No , it can 't be done . It would take time , planning . We don 't know where it 's at . We don 't know who has it . We know where . Brick Mansions . And we know who . MAYOR : That 's Tremaine Alexander , ex-soldier turned illegal arms dealer . He used military-grade weapons to unite the gangs and take over the city 's drug trade . Rules with an iron fist . I 've spent my entire career trying to take down Tremaine . But he never leaves Brick Mansions and there 's checkpoints everywhere . You know the routes around them . DAMIEN : Yeah , but then what ? You have no intel inside . No eyes . We have your eyes . Lino Dupree . French Caribbean expat . Spent most of his adult life in Brick Mansions . Knows it like the back of his hand . So the best idea you could come up with was to send me into this shit with a convict as my partner ? Yeah . And you got ten hours , detective . What 's he locked up for anyway ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) Killed a cop . ( HELICOPTER FLYING OVERHEAD ) ( BUZZER ) Dupree , let 's go . Transfer . ( BUZZER ) ( BUZZER ) MAN : Get in the van . Unh . Get in ! I 'll be back .

COMPUTER : Recalculating itinerary . LINO : Where are we headed ? Brick Mansions . There is no way you could drive this van past the barricades . Two minutes ago we were handcuffed and in the back of this thing . Why 's a guy like you going to Brick Mansions ? I 'm after Tremaine Alexander . He killed a friend of mine . The same asshole kidnapped my girlfriend . Ex-girlfriend . Sounds like we got something in common . How do you plan to get inside ? There 's an old smuggling route . COMPUTER : Take a right at fifty meters . ( POLICE SIREN CHIRPS , BLARES ) Better buckle up . - I prefer to be free . - Suit yourself . We could lose ' em by the east wall .

Hope you 've been enjoying our accommodations . I so don 't miss this place . Hey , look . You keep it cool with me , I 'll keep it cool with you . I try to impress education on my boys over here , but they 're a different breed . If they 're not out capping niggas in the streets , they 're in some dark room , capping ' ' em on a video screen . So I give ' em a job , you know . At least they can feed their families . Look , between me and you , I like Lino . He has a cause . Even if it gets him killed . People like you remind me why everyone hates us . ( SCOFFS ) You and him are a lot alike . I can see why y 'all are together . Separated . Well , don 't worry , mamasita , your hero will be here soon . Oh , you didn 't hear the good news ? Lino escaped . I 'm sure he 's going to be coming here . And I wouldn 't want to be you all when he gets here . Tremaine , we all good on the roof if you want to head back over . Rayzah here 'll keep you company . Yo , get your hands off my chips . Damn ! Oh , shit ! MAN : Move ! ( GROANS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) How 'd you know I was a cop ? You don 't belong here . How 'd you find me ? I put a bug in your pocket . Cop tricks . That 's all you people have . No , we have the law , which is something you don 't care about . The law means nothing without justice . That 's pretty high-minded for somebody that killed a cop . That cop was a corrupt piece of shit , no better than Tremaine . I 'm here to find Tremaine . I 'm here to find him before a weapon he hijacked kills everybody inside of Brick Mansions . Probably didn 't occur to you that somebody on the outside could actually give a shit about what happens in here , now , did it ? Not everybody out there is an asshole just like not everybody in here is a junkie or a thief . But you enjoy yourself . And if I find your girlfriend , I 'll tell her you said , " Hi . " They will shoot you and take your badge as a trophy . At least I 'll die trying , which is a hell of a lot better than sitting around bitching about how the world sucks . If you 're not bullshitting about that bomb maybe I can save Lola before we all go down . Heh . And the first chance you get , what are you going to do ? You gonna put a bullet in the back of my head ? I could 've killed you already . So what 's your plan ? - You got a phone ? - Yeah . ( DIALING ) ( RINGING ) Tremaine ? It 's Lino . I 'm coming over . So that 's it ? You just throw us in the lion 's den ? Which no lion would ever expect . This is going to be a lot of fun . Not bad , right ? Uh-uh . Uh-uh-uh . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Ooh la la , Lola . Aah ! Aah ! Where are you going ? ! Huh ? I knew you 'd be fun to play with from the second I saw you . ( GRUNTS ) ( LOLA SCREAMS ) ( GROANS ) I really love this game . ( PIANO NOTES PLAY ) You wanna act like a bitch ? Heel ! TREMAINE ( OVER RADIO ) : Hey , Rayzah . I heard shouts . You can play , but not too hard , okay ? You are one lucky bitch . ( CHATTER ) - ( GUNS COCKING ) - What do we got here ? Take us to Tremaine . TREMAINE ( OVER RADIO ) : K2 , get your fat ass up here ! We got guests comin ' . Yeti , move it ! Upstairs now ! Showtime ! LINO : Damien , see that ? TREMAINE : Lino ! Surprised to see you back here so soon . You see ? He is surprised . Who 's your boy ? - I 'm his driver . - He 's a cop . - Come for his bomb . - Thanks . Thanks for that . That 's--that 's great . Wow . A real live cop . Haven 't seen one of those around here in years . I believe the police station closed around the same time as the school , the hospital , and all them other things the government thought we didn 't need around here . So what , you the new sheriff in town ? You 're a brave man . Where 's Lola ? Oh , we 'll get to her . Let 's talk about this bomb . You here to buy it ? No , I came to disarm it . That thing 's gotta make you a little bit anxious ticking ' . Tremaine Alexander don 't do anxious . I cause anxious . Now , I could be halfway down south before this thing goes off or you could make me and my peeps an offer . I 'll offer to disable it before it blows us all up . You like that ? Oh , that won 't fly . How about I just send it back the way I found it ? K2 , let the sunshine in . Gentlemen , please , you 're gonna love the view . Only a crazy person would have a rocket . When you live in a war zone , you prepare for war . Now , this thing is rigged to fly straight downtown at a push of a button . Let 's talk numbers . You 'd let all those people die over money ? That 's low , even for you . Nigga , where I come from , cash rule everything around me . You know that one , right ? First , I need to know Lola is okay . ( RADIO CLICKS , BEEPS ) Rayzah .

Now , stop the bullshit ! You tell me how much it 's worth to you . How much are those people downtown worth ? Because around here , we don 't seem to be worth shit . Look around , sheriff , this used to be a five-star palace . Doormen , women Waitin ' on tables . Where them bitches at now ? In the alley shooting ' it up ? Because of drug dealers like you . I didn 't cause this reality . I just help them ease the pain . Now cut the bullshit , and let 's get back to that money . It was at 15 million , right ? Fifteen . Do I hear 20 million ? Okay , stop the game , what 's it gonna take ? You got three million people downtown . $ 10 per person , price of a happy meal . That 's $ 30 million for me . - Then 30 million ? - Thirty million . Done . Thirty million it is . Thirty million . Sold ! To Lino Dupree and the new sheriff of Brick Mansions ! Call your people and make it happen . And , Lino , stay outta my business . ( RINGING ) ( PHONE RINGS ) - Yes . - DAMIEN : Detective Collier . Collier , Where are we now ? We 're close , really close . Close enough to punch the code in ? No . Unfortunately , no . What 's the problem ? The problem is that the new owner wants to sell . Are you sure the bomb is there ? Yes . I can tell you that there 's only 48 minutes before it blows up . Okay . How do we proceed ? You have a Hawaiian bank account ? I want it in cash , man . They can 't do cash . We still got an account in Hawaii ? - We do . - Give him the numbers . Bank 83675 . Bank 83675 . Account 021084 . Account 021084 . BERRINGER : What 's he asking ? $ 30 million . Hold on . Tremaine wants 30 million for the device . The city 's damn near broke . That 's a non-starter , detective . All right . Good . You have to find another solution . Exactly . All right , good , yeah . Perfect . That 's a wrap . They 're sending the money . - Let 's go disable that bomb . - Hold on . Wait a minute . Let my man verify the funds first . ( BEEPING ) Bank doesn 't open for another 25 minutes . Ah , 25 minutes . Well , that 's just enough time for me to finish dinner .

Face the rack . - On your knees . - DAMIEN : Shit . K2 : Put your damn hands behind your head ! I gotta tell you . I 'm claustrophobic .

I know where Lola is . And in 25 minutes , we 're heroes . In 25 minutes , Tremaine 's gonna shoot us and that device is gonna kill three million people . But when he gets his money , everybody walks away . There is no money . The city can 't pay . I was just trying to buy us some time . Forget what I said before . Don 't trust your instincts . They 're shit . I should 've killed Tremaine when I had the chance . Shut up . Wait . That story about Tremaine killing your friend , it 's true ? It was my father . He was leading some officers on a drug raid . He got separated from his squad . Tremaine 's boys captured him and killed him . I 'm sorry . Let 's go make him pay . LINO : Back me up . ( COUGHS , GAGGING ) Help him , man ! Stop it ! Stop ! Son of a bitch ! - What happened ? - Oh , shit ! - MAN : What ? - He 's not breathing . - What ? - We gotta get him out of here .

 Prevously on V ... . Are there others like , fighting against Anna ? The 're called Fifth Column . We have to crush them before they become a greater threat . If you 're Fifth Column , things are about to get very bad for you . A human female is carrying a visitor baby . Find them . Apparently , you 've been looking for me . Looks like I found what you 're really looking for . Joshua said you passed the empathy test . Why ? Because one day I 'll ask a favor from you . If my mother 's eggs are allowed to hatch , those soldiers will destroy the Fifth Column , won 't they ? Yes , they will . You 're doing great , Val . Keep breathing . You 're at 2 centimeters . This baby 's coming . Can I get you anything ? Yeah , glass of water ? Thirsty . Okay . No ! Aah ! You have a look . What 's up ? Want to talk to you out " live aboard . " Tyler ... Mom , I get that you 're not crazy about that idea , believe me , but it 's important to me . And I understand your concern about me moving up there , and so does Anna . Really ? She even invited us up for dinner . I mean , just me , you , Lisa and Anna . Okay . What ? Okay . Take your food . Oh , yeah . I love you . Jack , it 's Erica . Get everyone to the church . I have a plan . Where 's Ryan ? I 'm not sure . What 's going on ? Why 'd you call us here ? Tyler 's joining the " live aboard " program . I can 't stop him , but I can stop Anna . I don 't understand . Ryan told us that Anna 's v soldier eggs are about to hatch . If she has thousands of v soldiers at her disposal ... We 're dead . We are out of time . This is it . So what do you suggest we do ? We storm the ship and kill all the eggs ? That is exactly what I 'm suggesting . My kind of plan . I like your spunk . But none of us have ever been up there before . We don even know where the eggs are . No , we don 't . Joshua does . It 's never gonna happen . We had a plan to take out the eggs , but since the shuttle was shot down , Anna 's practically locked down the ship . Okay , there has to be something we can do . There 's two ways into the incubation chamber- - through a guarded corridor and through an entrance in Anna 's private quarters . Not even I can get in there anymore . I can . Anna invited Tyler and me onto her ship for dinner . This is too dangerous . You 'll need to create a diversion to get Anna out of her quarters so that Erica 's got time to get to the eggs . Dinner 's at 7 : 00 . You 'll need an explosive to destroy the eggs . Now we 're talking . What kind ? I have to go . Contact me when everything 's set up . We need to know you 'll be here if we 're gonna risk everything on our end . We will . Marcus released another wave of guards through the ship . They 're searching everyone . You 've gotta get rid of the comms device . If they find it on you , we 'll all be exposed . You haven 't returned our calls . You okay ? I needed my line to be free . My baby 's being born . What ? I 've been waiting for Dr. Pearlman to give me a call to see if they need my help . I haven 't heard from her . What 's going on ? Erica 's been invited up to the ship tonight . She 's gonna destroy Anna 's soldier eggs . Are you serious ? Yeah . I 'm going with you . You 're gonna need my help with this . No . Ryan , I think you should stay here , in case Val or the baby need you . Once you get up there , then what ? Anna 's never gonna let you out of her sight . Joshua 's planning a diversion . Anna will be pulled away for safety , and then she 'll make a move . Yeah , but what about Marcus ? He 's her watchdog up there . You can 't pull this off under his nose . I can get Marcus off the ship . Well , I 'm on top of the v 's most wanted list- - makes me excellent bait . Okay . Well , to do this , Erica 's gonna need a layout of the ship . Every detail you can remember , everything . The armada of ships from our home planet have arrived ahead of schedule . They 're within striking range of earth . Keep them cloaked and at bay . We don 't want them revealed until we 're ready for the next stage . Tyler 's mother is joining you tonight for dinner , as planned ? With Agent Evans as my ally on the ground and my newborn army , the humans won 't know what hit them . We got a problem . The comms device isn 't working . What ? We 're supposed to confirm with Joshua we 're go . Look , if we can 't reach him , you 're not going up there , Erica . Well , we can try skywriting . I could go to Chad Decker . No . Anna 's lapdog ? I prefer the skywriting idea . Unless someone has a better idea , I don 't see we have another choice . Jack , Chad is the one who went to Anna with our plans to blow up the shuttle . Chad is the one who went on air to convince people to follow her , to keep her here . What makes you think you can trust him ? I don 't . Look , that 's why we 'll have him deliver a message that he and she won 't understand . Look , we 're covered either way . If he doesn 't go to Anna with it , then he 'll deliver the message , and we 're a go . And if he takes it right to her ? Then Anna gets her hands on a message that means nothing to her . Ryan , they 've got Val . It all happened so fast . You 've gotta find her . Anna has my baby . Tell her Ryan nichols is here . You don 't have clearance . Ah , get off me ! Let him aboard . I want to talk to him . He 's dangerous . Why don 't we destroy him like any other traitor ? He was able to resist my bliss . He fell in love with a human and turned Fifth Column . You don 't understand what we have in him . An enemy . Insight into our enemy , the very thing that fuels humans- - love . That 's exactly why we have to study him , up close . If we can turn him back to us , we can turn anyone . Father ? Your call sounded urgent . What can I do for you ? Yes , I was , uh , given this message from one of my parishioners . It needs to be delivered to the mother ship . I know that you have access . Delivered to who , exactly ? I don 't know . If you agree to help , you 're to leave it in the medical Bay . So you 're saying that there are visitors who are part of the Fifth Column ? Yes , Chad . Even her own kind are turning on Anna now . And this message ... I 'm guessing it isn 't a hallmark card . Look , I wouldn 't know . I 'm just the messenger . I 'm--I 'm tired of playing games with you , father . The Fifth Column blew up a shuttle full of innocent human beings . All I 've seen the Fifth Column do is hurt people . They 're lies , Chad . The shuttle shootdown was a setup . Anna wants to paint the fifth column as a terrorist group , gather public support against them , and thanks to you , she succeeded . Please , Chad . Lisa . What is it , Joshua ? That favor you owe me ? It 's time to repay it . At 7 : 00 , we 're gonna create a diversion so your mother 's eggs can be destroyed before they hatch . What ? Those soldiers are bred for destruction , Lisa ... To kill humans . Here , take this . Joshua , you 're asking me to betray my mother , to mder my own kind . I 'm sorry . I can 't . You know she has a plan for Tyler ... The humans . It 's time for you to decide which side you 're really on . Get off me ! Where is she ? ! Val 's here . She 's safe for now . I just wish you would 've come to me sooner . Valerie 's pregnancy is exceedingly risky . It 's a miracle . So you kidnapped her ? To save her . If we 'd have asked , would you have let me ? She could 've died down there . You 're lying . You don 't care about saving her . All you wanna do is run tests , like she 's a lab rat . You can fight us or you can help us fight to save her life . It 's your choice . Red Sky , S01E12 Ryan . I 'm so glad you 're here . Ohh . We have to get out of here . You don 't have to be afraid . Okay ? But you warned me about the visitors . We don 't have a choice right now because your pregnancy is just really complicated . It 's dangerous . We need their technology to deliver the baby . Aah ! Ohh ! Oh , it 's coming , Ryan . I 'm scared . Val , I 'm so sorry for what I put you through . I 'm sorry I left . I love you . I don 't want to do this alone , any of it . You don 't have to . I 'm here now . Everything is gonna be okay . Aah ! Aah ! Her vitals are dropping . The baby 's crowning . You 're gonna have to wait outside . It 's okay . It 's okay . Are you sure ? Yes . Please , let them save the baby . I 'll be right outside . You ask me , we need to send you up to that ufo more often . Is that the explosive ? Yeah . The bomb you 're gonna use to scramble the bitch 's eggs is a next gen gel explosive . Unlike nitrates and peroxide , it gives off no signature . Yeah , even alien technology won 't pick this puppy up . What 's with the handbag ? Ah , just gonna hide it in the lining here . And it 's a clutch , not a handbag . What 's the initiator ? You got your cell phone ? Okay . You slip it in here like so . You set the timer ... And boom . Well ... Marcus will be off the ship by 1900 . Well , he 's second in command . How you gonna get him off the ship ? Well , I 'm gonna grab a gecko by the peace ambassador center , have him get a message up to the ship ... To set a meeting with Marcus , and then ... I 'll ambush their ambush . Well , that sounds dangerous . I 've walked away from much worse . Good . Erica , you ... Be careful like you said , Anna has an agenda , too . Okay ? Where did you get this ? From an intermediary - the same source who gave me the information about the shuttle . I 've been keeping an eye on him . I believe I 'm close to finding out who 's behind the message . Fifth Column ? My instructions were to leave this envelope in the medical lab . Does that mean there are visitors who are working with the Fifth Column ? No . My people are loyal and of peace . This message must have been intended for the " live aboard " humans . It seems we 've been infiltrated , even up here . Deliver this as instructed . I just don 't want to see anyone else get hurt . don 't worry , Chad . As soon as we stop the Fifth Column , nobody else will . Put the gun down , Mr. Hobbes . We have a lot to talk about . I believe you have something for me as well- - Parker 's research . Half of Parker 's research . I kept the other half in a safe place . You like to play games , Mr. Hobbes ? Now you really think I 'm gonna show up here without a insurance policy ? You want the other half ? I want answers . Why did you frame me ? Because I 'd like to hire you . And what makes you think I 'd ever work for you ? Because you already have been ... For years . Shall we talk , Mr. Hobbes ? You ready for dinner ? Yeah . I 'm ready . Don 't embarrass me . Okay . Welcome aboard , Agent Evans , Tyler . There are no firearms or any personal items allowed in Anna 's private quarters . Your bag . You don 't trust me with my purse ? Mom , they 're just trying to be safe . What if I get a call from work ? You can keep your phone . I 'm sorry , ma 'am . It 's our policy . Tyler , Erica . Welcome to the ship . Hey . Thank you for invitings to your home . I 'm thrilled you could make it . Hello , Mrs. Evans . Hello , Lisa . It 's lovely to see you . Please . I 'll join you in a moment . I have a matter I need to attend to . Mr. Decker ? How can I help you ? I was told to deliver something here , from a friend of yours on the ground . I don 't have any friends on the ground . I think you must have the wrong person . My mistake . Must be for someone else . What if that was a message from Erica ? Why didn 't you take it ? Chad Decker 's Anna 's willing pawn . He can 't be trusted . We have to warn the others not to engage with Mr. Decker . Anna may be using him to weed out Fifth Column . There isn 't time . I can send out a message to everyone at once . I 'll erase it quickly so it can 't be tracked back to them . What choice do we have ? Do it . Why did you me ? You 're a man with a history of serving your loyalty to the highest bidder . We want to continue to retain your services . To do what ? Infiltrate a terrorist group known as the Fifth Column . And if I say no ? You won 't . Well , I 've got the research you so desperately want . I 've got the leverage here , chief . Not you . We play by my rules , or I walk out of here , and you 'll never find me . Well , we may not be able to find you , but we found her . Now ... Let 's talk Fifth Column , shall we ? Track down everyone that message was sent to . Put him with the others when you find them . Anna will deal with you . This was for you . You set us up . They 'll all be caught . And ? And they 'll be skinned alive ! You 're lying . Anna would never do that . No , Chad . You 've been fooled like the rest of the humans . The Fifth Column 's trying to save humanity . She lied to you . Anna didn 't cure your aneurysm . She gave you one . I don 't believe you . There 's a door to a restricted corridor 50 feet from Anna 's executive suite , where they take the " live aboards . " What you see there will answer all your questions . This is your homily for tonight , then , is it ? The visitors as false prophets . Do you think that 's wise , speaking out against them after all the good they have done ? I 've been quiet about my feelings about the v 's for too long , father . They 're dangerous . Dangerous ? People are worshipping them instead of God , growing dependent on them . This is my opportunity to speak my mind from my pulpit . It 's more than an opportunity . It 's an obligation . Jack , the visitors are a miracle . How can you be sure that Anna isn 't sent by our lord ? That the visitors aren 't his handiwork ? You told me I lost touch with my parishioners because I haven 't spoken to them from my heart . This is what 's in my heart . I want you to speak to them , but not like that . I will not allow a message of hate to be preached fr my pulpit . Write a different homily . And if I don 't ? This istill my church , Jack . Speak out against the visitors , and you are no longer welcome here . One more push . Oh ! Oh ! My baby . I wanna see my baby . Both the baby and mother are stable . I 'm pleased the baby survived . The mother , however , did not . Ryan . It must be challenging being a single mother , isn 't it ? Well , it can be difficult at times , but , uh ... It 's worth every minute . Head of the task force , a teenage son- - how do you do it all ? Same as you , I guess . Lots of worrying . Okay , now I am sure that the visitors have overprotective mothers , too . Right ? We do . We just show our feelings differently . Erica , I want you to know that you have nothing to worry about . We 're gonna take wonderful care of Tyler when he comes to " live aboard . " Do you think it 's safe with the Fifth Column ? Mom , come on . I 'm sorry . Between the two of us , I 'm sure we 'll make certain he 's safe . But this is a social occasion . May I pour you some more ? I would love that . Thank you . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's work . Please excuse me . Of course . Yes ? Lisa . I was just looking for my purse . No , you weren 't . I know why you 're here . It 's that way . And you 'll need this . Lisa . It 's a blue energy grenade . It will freeze the eggs . Twist the top to activate , place it in the center of the pool and get out as fast as you can . There was supposed to be a diversion . What happened ? I don 't know . Okay . No . You 'll be gone too long . It will cast suspicion . Go back inside . I 'll figure something out . Good luck . Lisa ? Joshua , what happened ? We were set up by Chad Decker . Everyone 's been rounded up . If you can get me out , I can still cause a diversion . You were right . I had to choose which side I 'm on , and I did . I gave Erica the blue energy grenade . How do I get you out of here ? I placed a bug in the med lab security system in case I ever needed to disable it . The code is " John May lives . " What are you going to do ? Whatever I have to . Go back to dinner . I 'll wait 15 minutes to cause the diversion so you 're not suspected . You 're very brave , Joshua . Thank you ... My queen . Your ship is beautiful , but you must get homesick . I know I would . It 's been difficult , yes . High commander . We need to move you to a secure location . What happened ? Fifth Column . We 're being attacked . Tell Marcus to return to the ship immediately . I can help . I need my gun . It 's okay . She 's an ally . Follow me . Here 's to your children 's future , Anna . Joshua , stop . It 's done . Now how do I get you out of here ? There can be no suspicion you 're Fifth Column . You have to kill me . No , I won 't . Come on . I 'm dead anyway , Erica . You have to do this , for all of us . We both know that . Don 't . Come on . Thank you . Shooting that terrorist saved many lives . To protect the visitors - that 's my job now , Anna . Did you get a good look at the shooter ? No , the pillars were in the way . I saw he had a v uniform . He wasn 't a v. He was a human . What ? My security team reported that a human infiltrated the ship and stole a v uniform . They 're still gathering the details . Anna , I 'm sorry . If there 's anything I can do ... Excuse me . Thank you for delivering that message . We 're hoping it 'll help us expose more Fifth Column . I would hate to see them drive you away . They won 't . And thank you for your loyalty . You 've trusted us with your career and your health . Without us , you 'd lose everything . Anna , thank you for an enventful evening . I hope we can do it again sometime . You can count on it . Ty ? You killed her , didn 't you ? You said yourself , I have use for her why would I kill her ? We did everything we could to keep her alive . If you 'd come to me earlier , we could have used our technology to save her life . This is what I was trying to protect your from . Human emotion . I 'm so sorry you lost her . But now ... Now you have me . You made it back in one piece . Good on ya . Mm . I couldn 't have done it if Marcus was there . I didn 't think you 'd come through . Guess I was wrong . You wouldn 't be the first . There 's a story in the bible about a man who loses his way , only to find it again . I 'm here today to tell you ... That i am that man . I was lost , but now ... Now I am found . I lost the courage to tell you the truth , that you need to choose who you are going to follow- - the v 's or God- - because you can 't serve two masters . I know some of you are confused . But we must stand for what we believe . We must reaffirm our devotion to God and renounce the v 's as false prophets . Even a single Judas in our midst can defeat us . There is a war upon us . A war for our souls . You are not alone . You will never be alone . No pain . No heartache . No human emotion . Just peace . My peace . With love , hope and faith , we can overcome anything . Who among you will join me ? Let " v " no longer stand for " visitor . " Let " v " stand for " victory . " I told you not to preach that message in my church . I 'll speak my heart . If you don 't let me do it here , I 'll do it somewhere else . Jack ... This will end badly . Now there 's someone I 'd like you to meet . Welcome home . I just found out . We believe it was Joshua . As your chief medical officer , he must have gained access to your private chambers and planted a bomb . We had everything completely locked down . He couldn 't have done this alone . Find out who else is responsible , at whatever cost . Are they all ... Dead ? Only 12 soldiers survived . Their core temperatures were severely affected . We don 't know how many will make it . Aah ! What is happening to me ? I believe you are experiencing your first human emotion . Aah ! This is terrible , to be sure , but we must not act rashly . They must pay . This is too soon . If we initiate this sequence now ... Do you know what you 've done ? Vengeance . Welcome back .

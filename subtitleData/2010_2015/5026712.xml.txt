 - Previously , on Touch ... - You 're late . Come on . Hi , Soleil 's mom . - This is my dad , Soleil 's grandfather . - I 'm Carl . Don 't do this , Frances . Don 't cut me out of your life . Longtime librarian ... Frances Norburg . Two children . William and ... Calvin . Calvin Norburg has my daughter . She 's doing well . You 're a very special girl , Amelia . And you may not know it , but you 're going to help a lot of people one day . I have committed a mortal sin . Murder . You want peace , stop what you 're doing . I cannot stop until all the 36 are gone . Because I 'm one of them . What do you mean she walked out on her own ? You were supposed to watch her every move . Amelia ! No ! Amelia ! Mandlebrot Incorporated just bought a loft downtown . Do you think that 's where Calvin 's living ? It 's a good bet . Lucy ? Lucy , you still up ? Oh , no . No ! You 've reached Lucy . Leave a message at the beep . Lucy , it 's Martin . Please call me back , okay ? I 'm worried . Look , I just need to know that you didn 't go to the police , okay ? Please call me back . Damn it . Jake , come on , buddy , we got to get up . I 'm sorry , buddy , but we got to go . The cops are going to be looking for us . What happened ? You ... What are you doing here ? You know what I 'm doing here . Where is she ? You think it hurts now , you better start talking . ... the devil told him , if you are the son of God , tell this stone to change into bread . Hi there . Not lost out here , are you ? No . No , sir . Do you have a trail map ? If not , I have extras . I do ... in my bag . Okay , forgive me for saying , you don 't look like a typical hiker . I understand , sir , but God sent me here for a reason , and I plan to fulfill it . Oh . Okay . You know the peaks here can be tricky . You need to be prepared . Food , water , shelter , proper clothing ... I assure you , I 'm prepared . Do me a favor- - stick to the main trail . There 's no cell reception , and I 'm out here looking for one guy missing already . All right , then . Be careful . Have a nice day . Jake ? Come on , buddy , I need you to grab your bag , okay ? Jake . Come on . Jake , turn that down ! Come on , buddy . We better go , okay ? Here 's your backpack . Jake ... please . 89.2 . Okay , buddy , I got it . This is Soleil 's . What do you want me to do with it ? You want me to take it back to her ? Okay , fine , I 'll take it back to her . Jake . I get it . 89.2 . But it doesn 't need to be that loud , okay ? Thank you . In the vacuum , radiowaves travel at the same speed as all forms electromagnetic radiation , that is , 299,792,458m / s . But human beings do not live in the vacuum , wherever we are , we 're surrounded by stimulae . Both positive and negative . Look , it 's just static . When negative stimulaes perceived , they travel from its source to its destination . The central cortex , at a mere 100m / s . But regardless of its relatively slow speed , its unpleasant sensation registers as something we call pain . And as humans , we are conditioned to do anything and everything to avoid it . Water ... I need water . You are lucky I don 't shove a hose down your throat and drown you . Where is she ! ? Do you feel that ? Calvin , whatever pain you are feeling right now , that 's nothing compared to what you put me through for the last 3 years , do you understand me ? Now , where is Amelia ? Where is she ! ? - I know that you know . - Yes , I do . I do . Where ? Where ? I want you to know , I would never hurt her , Not in a million years . I need a doctor . Okay ... okay , where does it hurt ? My ribs , they 're broken . Here or here ? The right , move to the right . Okay ... Where is my daughter ! ? ! ? Hey , buddy , we need to wait a while , okay ? This is too little early to be knocking on anyone 's door . Jake , Jake ! Good morning , guys . - Good morning , Mr. Hersh . - Carl . Carl ... I 'm sorry to bother you at this time , but Jake found something that belongs to Soleil , and obviously he felt he couldn 't wait . Jake ! I 'm sorry ... he 's got a mind of his own . Don 't they all , come in . - You want some coffee ? - No . Thank you . We won 't be staying that long . Jake , put that back , it doesn 't belong to us . That 's okay , that 's just some old pictures , still printed like the old days . I 'll check on Soleil and see if she 's awake , - you just make yourself comfortable . - Thank you very much . What do you got there , buddy . This ... That 's Calvin 's mother . Oh , my God . Well , Soleil is still in bed . Carl , I hope I 'm not being too forward , but , how do you know this woman ? 2x06 Broken Tell me where she is . I 'll go get her , I promise . Not good enough ! Calvin ... where is she ? She 's here in Los Angeles . Where ? Where ? My brother . I did it for my brother . I don 't care about your brother . Where is my daughter ? My research . Amelia- - mapping her brain is the key to everything . I know that taking her was wrong , but-but I 'm so close , and her gifts- - they could change the world . You are not hearing me , Calvin . Calvin . Calvin . Calvin ! Stay with me . Painkillers ... in my bedroom . You give me the painkillers , I 'll give you your daughter . How do you know Frances , Martin ? I don 't really know her . I 've met her a few times . I was friends with her son Calvin and I haven 't seen him for quite some time either . I didn 't know she had a son . Our relationship was mostly confined to the Santa Monica Library . I was a volunteer , she was the head librarian . Sounds romantic , huh ? You know , I was looking for Calvin . Uh , w-where does she live ? I wish I knew . For some reason she decided to move on . Quit her job , sold her house , no forwarding address . She gave me a number , but she never calls me back . I don 't know what else to do . I guess she doesn 't want to talk to me . Wish I knew why . It 's her life , but I feel I deserve to know . Well , if I run into Calvin , maybe I can help you find her . Jake . He 's been trying to find this radio station all morning . I 'm sorry , we 'll get out of your way . Jake , come on , Jake . Ye know not what shall be on the morrow . It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away . - What is that ? Submit yourselves , therefore , to God . - Are you okay , honey ? - ... resist the devil , - What is it ? - ... and he will flee from you . Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you . They 're coming . - Who 's coming ? - Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up . Here . Are you alone ? Can you move ? No . Please ... kill me . What was that ? - Kill me . - Hey ... Hey . What happened yesterday ? We almost got Amelia back . Lucy was 150 feet away from her daughter . Then a car pulled up , guy got out , grabbed her , and took off . Needless to say , Lucy 's devastated . I don 't even know where she is right now , but I think I can find Calvin . I got his mother 's license plate number- - I want to run a check on it , see if we can pull an address . What happened to the address I gave Lucy last night ? What are you talking about- - what address ? An apartment registered to a shell corporation connected to Calvin- - 2305 Fifth Street . - You really think this is his ? - It looks like it . Look , uh , can I leave Jake here for a couple hours ? This could be dangerous . Of course- - are you going to tell me what 's going on ? Later- - right now I got to find Lucy . There they are . Don 't move . I could have left right now ... walked out the front door . Could have called the cops , had you arrested for kidnapping , but I didn 't . Now , you can see your daughter today . But I need you to do something for me , too . What are you doing ? You from around here ? No . Are you ? Come here once a year with my family . Not this trail , though , it 's too dangerous . You shouldn 't be here . What is it you do ? I 'm a priest . It 's been a while since I 've been in to church . You 're a doctor ? I was . What are you now ? I don 't know . I made a mistake . I came out here to clear my head . Why are you here , Father ? For the same reason you are . Exactly the same . Please , Father . Just put me out of my misery . Confess your sin , and I will help you with your pain . I 'm a pediatric neurosurgeon . Three months ago a seven-year-old boy died ... while I was repairing something called an arteriovenous malformation ... and I was drinking the night before . No alcohol is permitted 24 hours before performing surgery . It 's my fault that boy is dead . That 's why you 're here- - penance . You 're making no effort to save yourself . Allowing God to punish you for your misdeeds ? And he did . This is what I deserve . I needed to be stopped . You hungry , sweetheart ? No . Amelia , I just think you should eat something . I made you a sandwich . You 're a liar . Excuse me ? - Liar , liar , liar ! - Amelia ... You 've been lying to me every day , every minute . You stop this , young lady , right now . You said my mom gave me up , but she didn 't . I saw her ! That 's enough . - You 're hungry , you need to eat . - Where is she ? ! Okay , okay , okay . That was her on the pier , wasn 't it ? Yes , it was . Take me to her ! It 's just not that simple , Amelia . There 's danger out there . There are people who want to do harm to you . You poor thing , caught up in this mess and all because of your gift . Stop pretending like you care about me ! I know it 's hard to understand , but I do . We all care about you . No , you don 't ! My mom does . You 're a liar and a criminal and a horrible person ! I am doing this to help my son . Well , I want my mom ! I 'm leaving . - No . - - Let me go ! - Let me go ! - No . - Please ... - Let me go ! Sit down . Sit . Now ... I need you to listen to me . Okay , I 'm listening . The first thing you need to know is that Martin Bohm is a liar . He lies about everything . Even his name . You can 't trust anything he says . I-I can 't hear that right now . Just , just ... I-I just want Amelia back . And I want you to have her back . I do . But I need you to understand what it is that I 'm doing . My work is very important , and Amelia is at the heart of it . Mapping the connections within her brain mathematically ... it can help millions of people . Millions . She is just a child , Calvin . There are miracles inside your daughter 's brain , Lucy . Miracles . All I 'm trying to do is provide a window so that we can see them . Lucy . There she is . This was taken two days ago . My mom 's been taking care of her . She 's so big . She 's doing really well . She 's talking again . Now , if you want to see her again , you 're gonna have to do everything that I tell you to do . Open the door ! Calvin , open the door ! - No . - What are you gonna do , kill me ? - Yes . - Okay , go ahead . You 'll never see your daughter again . Calvin , I know that 's Lucy 's car out front ! Now open the door ! It 's up to you . Open the door ! What do you want from me ? I bring you Amelia ... you bring me Jake Bohm . Calvin , open the door ! That 's your good deed for the day ? I guess it is . It 's pretty hot out here for a fire . You 're cold . That 's the least I can do . Rest ... and I will decide the next step . I don 't see him . I 'm gonna go get Amelia and bring her to the Valley reservoir . I 'm coming with you . No , you 're not coming with me . So , what , I just bring Jake there ? Yes , by 2 : 00 . Off the access road at Woodley . You promise ? Just be there . Eight , nine , two . Oh , no , Lucy . Son of a ... What are you doing ? You should have told me that you had a way to power your phone . Don 't you dare call for help . Did you know that on God 's planet Earth , there are a finite number of people who are equipped to interfere with fate ? Fortunately for you , I 'm one of them . Well , then , do what you promised ! I 'm quite capable of taking a life . But I 've chosen a different direction . You promised me ... you would let me die here . It 's what I deserve . God wants me to die . Who are you to speak for God ? I killed a child ! I have a son . How can I ... Just ... leave me here . All right ? Just leave me alone . Hello ? Is anybody here ? Martin ? Come on , Trevor , answer the phone . Did you figure out the problem ? I cleaned the SD card . Should be good to go . Back on right now . Trevor Wilcox . Uh , hey , Trevor , it 's Lucy . Oh , hey , Lucy . Looking for Martin ? Uh , no , no , no . That 's okay . Um , you need to get him on the phone . We had an argument . Oh , he 's not here . He was , but he rushed off to that address I gave you last night . But Jake 's here . Uh , he is ? Yeah . I 'm looking straight at him . Okay , um ... why don 't I come take him off your hands ? I 'll , uh ... I 'll be there in a few minutes , okay ? Sounds good . See you then . You know what 's going on here , don 't you ? I know you know . It 's gonna be okay . You 've reached Lucy . Leave a message at the beep . Damn it . Uh , uh , Martin , it 's me . Please meet me at the reservoir north of the 101 freeway . There 's an access road off of Woodley . Uh , I have Jake with me . I will explain later , but you need to come right now . Why the hell aren 't you answering your phone ? IT problem . What did I miss ? The address you gave me was Calvin 's apartment . Lucy 's carwas parked right out in front . There were signs of a struggle . I don 't know what to do . Martin , she came by ten minutes ago to pick up Jake . What ? ! Oh , no . Where is Jake ? Like I said ... You let her take my son ? You let her take Jake - without calling me ? ! - I 'm sorry . - Where 's my phone ? - Wait . It 's Lucy . Why would I have a reason not to trust her ? Son of a ... Doctor , I understand that a child died at your hands , but do you understand what happens to the child of a man who dies at his own ? A child of a suicide often decides that his own life is not worth living . What is your son 's name ? Sam . Do you wish that for Sam ? And how long ago did you say the boy died ? Three months ? It was 89 days ago . 89 days ago , one boy died due to your negligence . But how many children have you saved ? How many children will die if you abandon your practice ? Your story has reminded me , there is acceptable loss . I needed that reminder . Now , it 's time for me to get you out of here . Oh , but there 's ... there 's no way out . There is always the way you came in . Lucy , don 't you move ! So help me God , I 'll kill you . Jake , get in my car now ! - Jake , get in the car ! - Martin , things have changed . - You took my son ? ! - Listen to me ! Listen up ! You took my son ! If I hadn 't met you that day on that pier , you 'd still be walking up and down the beach , lost , wondering if your daughter was even alive . This is how you pay me back ? This is your gratitude ? I called you ! I left you a message ! Why don 't you tell me what you 're doing out here , Lucy . I found Calvin . I got to him . He 's bringing Amelia here , right here , in a couple of minutes . So you 're gonna trade my son for your daughter ? No ! I would never do that , never ! Why couldn 't you just let this play out through Jake ? You had to do things your own way ? He played you ! Look , listen to me . What do you mean by that ? You bought him the time to get away ... with your daughter . No . Listen to me . I-I saw her . She was this close . She looked me in the eyes , and she knew who I was after three years ! And then , it was like she was ripped from my arms again , so what would you do ? ! What was I supposed to do ? ! Tell me ! Anything . Anything but this . Mom ? Amelia ? Lucy , it 's been 40 minutes . He 's not coming . He 's coming . I know he is . He 's not . I 'm sorry , Lucy . It 's over . Just give it 15 more minutes . He could be on his way right ... Lucy , he could be halfway out of the country by now . At that moment , heaven was opened , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him . And a voice from heaven said , " This is my Son , whom I love . " - Lucy ? - " With Him I am well pleased . " Lucy , Jake 's been trying to get this radio station all day . It was static ... Just get in the car . Please , get in the car ! After fasting 40 days and 40 nights , he was hungry , and the tempter came to him and said ... Jake 's been trying to find this radio signal all day . I think somehow , if the signal 's getting stronger , we 're getting closer . To what ? Hopefully , your daughter . " ... but on every word that comes from the mouth of God . " Then the devil took ... Look over there . A radio tower . " If you are the Son of God , " he said , " Throw yourself down . For it 's written , " He will command his angels ... " I 'm sorry , ma 'am . No sign of your husband . The next hour or so , we 're gonna have to call it a day . Sam , it 's him ! Daddy ? ! Daddy ! The power of a radio signal depends on the magnitude of its electrical field in relation to the position of the observer . Mathematically , this power is expressed in millivolts per meter . But more often , the connection is simply described as strong or weak . For an observer in motion , the connection is always subject to change . Signal 's getting stronger . If the distance becomes too great , the connection will cease entirely . " All this I will give to you , " he said , " if you will bow down and worship me . " Oh , my God . What ? There 's Frances Norburg 's car . That 's her license plate . Worship the Lord your God and serve him only ... And the devil left him , and the angels came and attended him . Jake , you stay in the car . Okay ? Let 's go . Oh , my God . Amelia ? ! Ameli ... Amelia ? ! Amelia ? What are you doing here ? They killed her . How could they do this ? Where is Amelia ? Amel ... Amelia ? ! Amelia 's gone . She was here . I know she was . - Calvin , where is she ? - Where is she ? ! - She 's gone . - Calvin , put that gun down . - You promised ! - Put the gun down now ! Get on your knees . Now ! Get on you knees ! Where is she ? Where is she ? You promised ! Where is she ? ! She 's gone . And my mom is dead . Do not try to follow me . Or I swear to God , I will kill you . I 'll kill you both . Recall the lesson passed on to the elders . " Be self-controlled and alert . Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour . Resist him , standing firm in the faith , because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of suffering . " Resync for WEB-DL by Norther lost0ne

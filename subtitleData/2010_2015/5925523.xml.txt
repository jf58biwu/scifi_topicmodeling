 HORRIGAN : Covenant 's found their holy grail , then , haven 't they ? LOCKE : An element fatal to humans . Native to this little piece of Halo ring and nowhere else . We destroy the deposits with the Havok . LOCKE : Make sure what happened back there on Sedra never happens again . HORRIGAN : And in five hours and change that sun is coming up . We 're all gonna be dust . [ Grunting ] Haisal ! LOCKE : You don 't do that ! You don 't play God ! You see God anywhere ? Tonight , we are God . LOCKE : You got a death wish with what happened to you , that 's fine . But I still got some fight . Me and you ? Which one of us is gonna fly the tug ? Then people are gonna start to make choices . You realize that , don 't you ? [ Screaming ] He fell . HORRIGAN : It 's over , forget it . Important thing is you still have that gun . Put it down . We will not go out like this . I tried to save you . I 'm not the one who needs saving . AIKEN : We 're close . [ Panting ] [ Panting rapidly ] Hurry up ! He 'll turn on you , huh ? Shut up ! The least essential one always dies . Me , he needs to fly the ship . You ? What 's he needs ? You 're telling me this why ? Because I trust you more than him . Havoks are supposed to be bulletproof . Let 's see if that was just advertising . MACER : Sir , looks like some of the propulsion might still be functional . Condor won 't get us off the ring , but if we could disengage it , get the thrusters working , we could still make the tug . [ Grunting ] [ Ramos grunts ] [ Panting ] HORRIGAN : What ? He 's right . You don 't need me . He 's got a point . He has no point . Tug like that has an autopilot . Then why are we keeping him around ? 'Cause it also has a biometric ignition . That 's the card he 's been playing the whole time . We need his fingerprint to start the thing . But that 's all we need . His fingerprint . Come on . [ Grunts ] We got about a half hour left . So all we gotta do is set this thing , get away clear , let it detonate while the tug is in orbit . MACER : We have problems . I spoke too soon . Propulsion 's still functional , but the fuel cells are shattered . Not getting anywhere without fuel . Might still be a way . This thing has a standard backup power cell . We use this for the ship instead , might be just enough to get us out of this canyon to that tug . Get this cell into the system . Test it , make sure it 's still working . MACER : Yes , sir . We can 't leave the deposits intact . We came all this way . And at least one of us isn 't getting off this rock anyhow . I think the only thing we can do is get two of us up and out towards that tug , whilst the other remains behind . Detonates the Havok by hand . [ Ramos wheezing ] I gotta top up . We don 't have time for this ! HORRIGAN : Saturate quick . [ Panting ] [ Device beeps ] I 'm getting nothing . [ Grunting ] [ Machine whirring ] It 's a go . But I suggest we get going ASAP . Not sure how long it 's gonna hold . AIKEN : Save it till we 're ready . [ Powering down ] Go with her , you don 't have much time . Like hell you get to make that decision . Three of us aren 't making it out here , we already know that . Let 's make the choice now . Walk , goddammit . I called this mission . It 's on me . Never did draw those straws , did we ? [ Bead clatters ] [ Beads clattering ] I 'll choose two . One red . One white . Three . You 're too young . Soldier 's a soldier . Three . Just so you know , Private . No do-overs . You wanna be a soldier and you pick red , I will walk on you . Let the beads decide . [ Beads clatter ] Red one stays behind . [ Exhales ] As it should be . Go . I could draw on you , if you want . Get her going , Macer . See you in Valhalla . They don 't let ONI into Valhalla . You , they might . [ Powering up ] [ Engine rumbling ] There they are ! [ Screeching ] [ Worms chittering ] [ Device beeping ] What the hell ? [ Yells ] [ Engine stalling ] We got problems . Steady , Macer . [ Screaming ] Come on ! You 'll never catch ' em if you 're dragging me . [ Both panting ] Don 't do it ! [ Engine whirring ] [ Screeching ] Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! [ Gun shots ] [ Screeching ] No , no ! No ! No . [ Yelling ] [ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] [ Rumbling ] [ Beeping ] [ Timer beeping ] [ Screeching ] [ Beeping ] Now , come on ! I need you help here , bus driver . Autopilot hardware 's same as most . [ Beeping ] [ Powering up ] We 're going . We 're going ! [ Engine whirring ] [ Timer beeping ] [ Rumbling ] AIKEN : Death will come to all of us . Especially soldiers . It will come inevitable as the sun . It is only to be feared if you fear what 's on the other side of it . If you see darkness in your soul . Rather than light . In a way , I suppose soldiers are gods . You give your life away so others will live . In peace . Even if it 's only fleeting . The ones that live carry part of you with them . Your deeds become seeds for theirs . The sacrifice carries forward . And in their final moments as a soldier you know they will have to answer the same question you did in yours : with your life would you only create death ? Or with your death would you create life ? That is my question to you , Commander Locke . How will you die ? And for what ?

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... H.G. ' s not really here . She 's a hologram . That thing is projecting her . I drew my gun on Mrs. Fredrick , and she fired me . [ Sighs ] How can my mom be a Regent and not have told me ? Collodi 's Bracelet . I think it fell into the hands of a young boy . The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . But it would have planted a seed of darkness in his soul . Claudia , now would be a good time to pinpoint that signal . I 'm trying , but whatever 's transmitting from inside the warehouse has slowed the whole system to a crawl . [ Over radio ] Pete , Myka . Any sign of the intruder , yet ? Letter 36-J ? It 's quiet . Ditto , in Montgomery . 84-K . Clean in the Farnsworth aisle . The archive is safe . [ Over radio ] Well , keep looking . Someone or something is still transmitting . [ Sighs ] [ Over radio ] Pete , you enter dark vault . And Myka , you go to aisle- - Gotcha . Sulaco , 84-C . It 's there . Sulaco , 84-C . That 's right near the art gallery . Let 's go , Claudia . Bring the scanner . That 's why the computers have been so glitchy lately . We 've got bugs . To be specific , nanites . Aw , man . What are nanites ? I don 't know . Tiny , self-replicating microscopic robots . Mechanical fleas slash spies . Could have hitched a ride on anything . No , no , no , no , no , no . Not these . These were planted on that Van Gogh that Sally Stukowski helped us retrieve . That painting is now exactly one gram lighter . That grab was a setup . If she 's working for that psychopath that tried to kill my mom- - Walter Sykes ? They 're downloading a massive amount of data and transmitting it . To where ? I can 't tell yet . I want those things out of my warehouse , now . It could take me days to interface with their coding , Artie . Then plan B. When you got bugs , you zap ' em . Okay , everybody , back up . [ Imitating Al Pacino ] Say hello to my little friend . Oh , crap . Oh , no , no , no , no ! Oh , what are you doing ? Something wrong here , Tyler ? Uh , no , Mr. Sykes , I- - I think the warehouse found and shut down all the nanites . Before you got what I needed ? No , uh , I got it . Um , you 'll be happy . Have you decrypted the data yet ? I 'm-I 'm working on it , sir . Finish it . Then I 'll be happy . Yes , sir . These nanites could be a fatal breach . Do we have any idea what Sykes was after ? I 'm typing as fast as I can . Okay , first , he rifled through some inventory . Looking for the Collodi Bracelet , I 'll bet . Then he downloaded a file . " Atlas-66 . " But it 's majorly encrypted . That file is for Regent use only . Well , here 's hoping . What do you think ? Sykes could have opened that file ? Uh , I 'm not even sure I could crack it . Well , you don 't have to . Jane has access . She can tell us what 's in the file , and we can finally get ahead of Sykes . That 's not how we 'll proceed . But this could be our chance to shut Sykes down . The Regents have a plan in place , Agent Bering . So you 're not gonna tell us what 's in Atlas-66 ? Perhaps I haven 't been clear . We have a plan in place . Well , perhaps I haven 't been clear . We need to know what 's in that file . Right , Pete ? - Hmm ? Uh , well- - Myka , if she says there 's a plan in place , we need to respect that , right ? I mean , she is wearing the Remati Shackle . So , Warehouse protection is her call . Thank you , Pete . Now , excuse me . I need to speak to Mr. Kosan . Excuse me , I need to tag some stuff in the motorbike aisle . And with that , we all just left it alone , right ? Of course . Right . [ Door slams shut ] Lattimer ! What the hell is going on ? Trust me , Myka . Arguing with my mother will get you nowhere . So you 're just gonna lie down ? Who are you ? A guy who knew you 'd follow me . [ Remote beeping ] Old chum , welcome to the Pete Cave . Sit down . I got something to show you . You 're not gonna make me watch Porky 's again , are you ? No . So , you 're not just sitting back . [ Scoffs ] Please . Okay . Now , these are the facts . Walter Sykes , paralyzed as a child , gets his hands on the Collodi Bracelet , which allows him to walk again , but apparently , it turns him into like , the worst guy ever . Right . The Warehouse snags it . Sykes wants it back . He makes millions in hedge funds . Then , ten years ago , he cashes out and apparently vanishes off the face of the Earth . So he 's been planning a run at the Warehouse for a long time ? Right , but the minions he 's hired to do his dirty work all have one thing in common . They 're dead . Well , the obit says that Stukowski died of an undetected heart defect . Yeah , right . So , who 's working for Walter Sykes , now ? Everything okay ? - Yeah . - Stay close . I 'm going to need you two to collect something important . We 're ready . ♪ Warehouse 13 3x11 ♪ Emily Lake Original Air Date on October 3 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = You wanted to talk to me , Mr. Sykes ? Steve , you 're still trying to decide if you can trust me ? Well , the enemy of my enemy is my friend , right ? Look , I just want my life back . My old job , my reputation . The Warehouse burned you . It burned me , too . You know , the Regents have a nasty habit of reaching out and destroying people 's lives . Believe me . I 've noticed . So , if I help you get the Collodi Bracelet back , you can get me reinstated at the ATF ? Yeah . Or you can have a blank check and start a new life . That 's your call . Tyler cracked the first part of the file . We know where it is . The only lead we have left is this man who I clocked in Atlanta . It 's just the face in a car . It 's not much to go on . Okay . So , we profile , right ? I mean , what kind of person goes to work for a man like Walter Sykes ? A guy like Tyler Struhl . Hey , did you follow us here ? No , I 've known about the Pete Cave forever . Who do you think keeps it stocked with cream soda ? Really ? That was you ? Wait , who 's Tyler Struhl ? The hacker slash perv who was killing women with the Golem Necklace . Hacker codes are like a signature , and Tyler 's all over the nanites . Could he hack into the Regent file ? If I can , he can . I mean , I haven 't been able to open the whole thing , but I did dig out an address . Lincoln High School , Cheyenne , Wyoming . Well , Cheyenne is only like , two hours from here . We should check it out . Against Jane 's orders ? What 's she gonna do ? Ground me ? Anyway , I 'm not going to sit around here and wait for the next bad thing to happen . I agree with Pete . I 'll run interference . Go . Go now while she 's still with Kosan . This is a dangerous game . We must bring the rest of Regents in on your plan . No . Sykes has already tortured and killed Regents to get information . The less they all know , the better . This is a great burden for you to bear alone . Perhaps we should simply eliminate Walter Sykes now and- - Evan ... We all agreed that we needed to know his endgame . Without that knowledge , even with Sykes gone , the Warehouse is still vulnerable . There 's more that 's troubling you . My son is on the frontline of this war . If I 'm wrong ... I could lose a lot more than the Warehouse . I 'm going to take upstairs . You take down . [ Bell rings ] Hey , Myks . You got anything ? I think I found what Sykes was looking for . You found the artifact ? Not quite . H.G. Wells is--is here ? What-she--she broke out of Regent jail to come here ? I wanna go talk to her . Ah , Myka , no . You-you know how lethal she is . We don 't know what she 's up to . Just wait there for me . [ Bell rings ] Helena . Hello . Are you looking for somebody ? Do the Regents know you 're here ? Um- - I 'm sorry , you must be lost . The main office is straight down the hall . Look , we don 't have time for games . Some very dangerous people know that you 're here . Um , okay , uh- - there must be some mistake here . Uh , let 's just school security and then- - - Freeze ! - Ah ! Now that 's new . Why 'd you come in here , all guns a-blazing ? It 's an escaped H.G. Wells , Myks . What if she was having one of her let 's-end-the-world days ? No , something 's wrong , okay ? She 's acting like she doesn 't even know who I am . Well , at least we know what Sykes is after . But what he wants with lady cuckoo ? Hello . Hi . Who are you people ? What do you want from me ? We 're United States Secret Service . We may be dealing with a case of identity theft . We just need to see your driver 's license . It 's in my purse . Careful , Myka . Well , it could be booby trapped . [ Laughs ] [ Clears throat ] Pete , look at this . Who the heck is Emily Lake ? I don 't suppose we could put a doggy door in the umbilicus ? [ Laughs ] Doggy door . You 're silly . Whatcha doing ? Ah , you know . Updating the firewalls , reviewing inventory , blah bitty blah . The ushe . [ Sighs ] Fine . Okay . You got me . I 'm playing fruit combat . Until Jane tells us the plan , I am bored , so- - All right . I 'm going to my room . Trailer . Busted . [ Gasps ] Did you just Mrs. Frederic 'd me ? Tell me that that is not the Regents ' encrypted Atlas file , and that you are not doing the one thing that you were explicitly told not to do . That would be lying and if there 's one thing I 'll never do- - Where are Pete and Myka ? I still don 't know why the Secret Service has to see my apartment , but here it is . I-I 'm not this Helena , whoever that is . Look , it 's not--it 's not that we don 't believe you . It 's just we want to understand what 's going on . [ Silverware clattering ] There 's something in the kitchen . Oh , Dickens . - [ Cat meowing ] - Mommy 's home . H.G. Wells is a ... Cat lady ? Yeah , good boy . Hello . Dickens is hungry . And scared . - Just like his mommy . - Oh . I 'm gonna feed him . Shoot me if you have to . Myka , we don 't have time for this , okay ? Sykes could be on his way here right now . Bills , magazines- - they 're all addressed to Emily Lake . Okay , so she fooled the post office . It 's not that hard to do . Myka , don 't buy this . She is a lunatic killer , and she 's just- - she 's hiding it somehow . Pete ... Oh , my God . Look at this . There 's no reflection in the mirror . She wasn 't really there . These--these are all fakes . Somebody must have created a-a new identity for her . Who does that sound like to you ? The Regents ? Some sort of Witness Protection program ? We got this info from the Atlas file . Atlas-66 . That 's--that 's it . H.G. Wells was born in Atlas House in 1866 . I can 't believe that I missed that . Yeah , sloppy . We gotta get her somewhere safe before Sykes finds her . Let me go . I 've-I 've got a knife . All right . Let 's not do that , okay ? [ Screams ] Do you see ? H.G. knows Kempo . If she wanted to hurt you , you 'd be lying in a pool of your own blood right now . I-I-I don 't want to hurt anyone . I just- - Wait . What is it ? I got a vibe . A bad one . [ Door creaks ] [ Door closes ] Aw . You just missed her . Where is she ? What does Sykes want with H.G. ? Time machine , Minoan Trident ? Or just another homicidal maniac to add to his roster ? He was right . You are a talker . Who was right ? [ Screams ] [ Groans ] [ Cat screeches ] [ Grunting ] Hey . You guys okay ? Pete . Steve , what- - He took my Tesla . You 're working for Sykes ? Where 's Marcus ? Marcus ? Oh , oh . Is that--is that your new partner ? The guy who just tried to kill me ? [ Scoffs ] I 've got some bad news for you , pal . [ Door slams open ] [ Sighs ] What the hell ? Is that H.G. ? Yes . Then we 're done . [ Zapping ] [ Screams ] No ! [ Groans ] Farnsworth . You are both in big trouble . You don 't know the half of it . We lost her , Artie . W-wait . Lost who ? Emily Lake . You two found Emily Lake ? Where is she ? Sykes has her . Damn it ! This is why you follow orders ! Look , Sykes would have gotten her either way , and we wouldn 't have known about it . We know who 's working for him , Artie . A guy by the name of Marcus who just walked away from a five-story fall . What ? And someone else . Someone we know . No . No way , that 's- - Artie , that 's not even possible . Steve would never turn on us . We 're his friends . He 's-he 's--must be being controlled or blackmailed , or maybe there 's an arti- - Claudia , Claudia . He Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . He kidnapped H.G. No one was forcing him to do those things . Then this is the Regents ' fault . They burned him . They gave him no choice . Everyone has a choice . And as I 've discovered , people often make the wrong one . Please . I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 've never even heard of any ... Warehouse 13 . You are H.G. Wells . That 's insane . My name is Emily Lake . Emily Hannah Lake ! I grew up in Omaha- - [ screams ] You 're lying . She 's telling the truth . You 're absolutely certain ? You know I can tell , and she 's not lying . Or at least she believes what she 's saying is true . Well , I got a gift too , Steve . Getting people to tell me things . Cecil B. Demille 's riding crop . It won 't work . It lets you bend people 's actions to your will . But you can 't control their minds . You 've collected quite a few artifacts . Yeah , enough to even up the odds . I 'm inclined to trust your gift , Steve . I mean , after all , that is why we sought you out . So we 'll leave Ms. Lake alone , and give Tyler enough time to crack the rest of that file . Hopefully , the answers are inside . For her sake . What exactly did you do to H.G. ? Myka , it was the most humane option . After the near-catastrophe at Yosemite , well , the Regents had to do something . The punishment was unusual , but it wasn 't cruel . We searched for something that would give H.G. a chance at a normal life while still allowing us to use her as a resource . Claudia , I assume you cracked the rest of Atlas-66 . Yup . A Janus coin . Two heads . It facilitates the separation of a person 's consciousness from their body . Like the Zoetrope did to Hugo . The Zoetrope is a machete . The Janus coin is a finely honed scalpel . Artie , show them the video . It will make it clear . So ... How exactly will this work ? In Roman mythology , Janus is the God of transitions . There 's two heads , looking opposite directions . Forward and back . My past life and my future life . Yes . And the coin will separate the two . So , I 'll lose all knowledge of the Warehouse . Yes . And everyone I 've ever known ? Yes . [ Sighs ] One request . May I keep my love of literature ? That can be arranged . We 'll start with your earliest memories . Mother and father . That 's right . Move through your childhood . Your young adulthood . Your first day at Warehouse 12 . Tell me what you 're thinking . I met an old man . He was my teacher . His name was Caturanga . Tell me his name again . I- - I don 't remember . Good . Think about your inventions , your experiments , your writings . Picture Kempo and weaponry . People ... Friends , family , lovers . Let the images come to you . Conjure them . Your whole life in England , let it go . You 're American now . [ Gasps ] Who are you ? I 'm Mr. Kosan . You had a terrible accident . And you lost your memory . But I 'm going to help you get it back . Thank you . They sent her to Wyoming , gave her a place to live , a cat , photos of the past that never existed , and we gave her a job . School teacher . Like you . As for the rest , well , the human mind is pretty inventive . Given enough time and stimulation , it fills in the gaps all by itself . So if H.G. ' s memory 's been wiped , then who 's the hologram we 've been talking to the last few months ? Not wiped . Stored . On the Janus coin . Which , according to the file , is kept in a Regent vault in Elk Ridge , South Dakota . Sykes is going to send Marcus and Steve for the coin . Look , I know that the Regents have a plan , but we can 't risk Sykes getting a hold of that coin . If he already has Emily Lake , if he tries to put H.G. back together ... You 're both right . You and Myka need to retrieve that coin , and bring it back here . Mr. Sykes ! Mr. Sykes ! I got it . I found what you 're looking for . And the best part is it 's not even in the Warehouse . So , how do we get into this vault ? Mom said all we 'd need is this fancy key and this list of stuff to buy . This is the Regent vault ? Of course it is . Hidden in plain sight . That 's what they do . You got our list ? Alfred , let 's go shopping . [ Scanner beeping ] That 's weird . Not when you get to know us . I gotta get my manager . Okay . Fruits , grain , meats , alcohol , honey . These are all items that the ancient Egyptians used to leave for their Kings in the burial tombs- - Which were also known as vaults . Right . Man , the Regents really love the Egyptian stuff , huh ? It 's like a fetish . Wow , definitely in the right grocery store . Come with me . [ Keypad tone ] The key . Oh . He 's not very chatty , is he ? No , he 's not . I 'll be in the stock room . Okay , so , here 's the sphere . Where 's the Janus coin ? I remember seeing a slot . Ah-ha . See ? I always loved piggy banks . - What ? - Let me see . So , then if a coin is like the hard disk , then to reboot , I just slide it back in . Oh , hello . What 's this ? Uh , another mission ? Lady , we 've got a lot to tell you . Living with a cat in Wyoming ? Also , you have an American accent and a really girly scream . So , my body 's out there teaching high school English ? And your students love you . But a cat ? Dickens is solid . Saved my bacon . Yes , I don 't know what that means , but what does this Mr. Sykes want from me ? We were kinda hoping you could tell us . Uh--I 'm afraid I have absolutely no idea . Get her here as fast as you can , and keep your eyes open . And be careful . Stick to the back roads . The back roads ? Driving from Elk Ridge to Univille ? Good point . Stay alert . [ Sighs ] I don 't have a good feeling about all this . I 'm not used to military maneuvers . I 'm an elementary school teacher . Elementary school teacher to Regent . Strange trajectory . Not at all . Each Regent is selected for his or her area of expertise . Each brings a unique perspective . I was chosen for my insight into children . Jane ... What 's the downside to the Collodi Bracelet ? If the user wears it for too long , it plants a seed of darkness in the soul and creates an insatiable longing . And at the same time , this longing hardens the heart . The wearer cannot give or receive love . Is it possible , all those years ago , we didn 't get to the boy in time ? Hey , Myka . I , uh--I have a thought . About a way to protect the Warehouse , but- - But what ? You might not like it . Well , if it protects the Warehouse , I like it already . What is it ? Whoa , where are we going ? Off road . We have to destroy the Janus coin . What ? I know you 're gonna think this is personal- - How could I not ? You 're--you 're talking about killing a human being . No , I 'm talking about destroying the thing that Sykes is after . We can stop it , right here . Right now . She has one of the greatest minds in history ! It 's--it would be like burning down a library w-with a friend trapped inside . I know . But we 're at war , and unfortunately , wars have casualties . No . Okay , so you 're willing to live with the possibility that Sykes might get what he wants . H.G. would never help him . Myka , the man has proven he can get information from anyone . Even Steve 's working for him . No , he 's not . I know he 's not . Okay , just hold up . Both of you . We have to deal with reality . Wait , Claudia . Claudia ! Like , I 'm just thinking of the greater good . As long as that coin exists , it can be used against the Warehouse . The answer is still no . We cannot--I will not destroy H.G. Wells . May I offer an opinion ? I figured she should be part of this discussion . There is no discussion . Agreed . If you truly want to protect the Warehouse , you must destroy the coin . Destroy the coin , and whatever Sykes wants from me will be lost with it . Wait . You 'd be gone , you 'd- - you 'd be dead . The price is too high . What about Emily Lake ? If Sykes thinks he can put her back together , she 's in a lot of danger . Destroy me , and she 'll be of no value to him . Myka , you say she 's a teacher and her students love her . Then , let me live on through her . We could rescue Emily Lake . I can promise you that . I have every confidence that you will . Myka , we have to think rationally , not emotionally . And quickly . Before I remember that I 'm not this noble . It 's the right thing to do , Myka . You know that , don 't you ? Pete , um--I think you 'll have to be the one to-- - I know . I will . And ... Thanks for everything , Helena . [ Sighs ] I regret I won 't be here to see you reach your destiny . It will surely be a glorious one . I don 't know about that . Then , you 're the only one . How do you say goodbye to the one person who knows you better than anyone else ? I wish I knew . Be brave . I need your strength . The last thing I want to see is the sky . Pete . I can 't watch this . Me neither . [ Sighs ] Forgive me for this . Why can 't I move ? Because I 'm controlling your body now . I 'll get the coin . Not one move ! [ Gun cocks ] Myka , he has an artifact . How 'd you find us ? Traced the signal on Claudia 's cell . You 're a traitor . Traitor . Stop or Marcus is dead ! Yeah , well , Marcus doesn 't usually stay dead for long . Then I 'll shoot you , Steve . I don 't think that you will . Just in case ... No ! [ Groans ] Myka ! Claudia ! Give me the coin . You know what ? I got a better idea . How about you fill in the blanks ? Tell me how we went from being partners and friends to you pointing a gun at me ? How could you work for Sykes ? There are things that you don 't know . About the Regents , about Jane . Now , give me the coin . I know this . You want this coin ? You 're going to have to shoot me . [ Gunshots ] Claudia ! Claudia ! I don 't care what I have to do . You 're dead , man . You 're dead ! You 're very perceptive . Hey , where 's Claudia ? Where is she ? Do you have the coin ? Let 's go . Now , you can help Claudia and Myka , or you can follow us . That 's your choice . - You selfish- - - Pete ! If you 're gonna help Claudia , you have to hurry up . [ Screams ] - Claudia ! - Claude ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Both : Claudia ! Claudia ! Claude ! Please keep it down . - Why didn 't you answer us ? - Is Steve gone ? He told me to wait until he was gone . Wait--wait for what ? Claudia , what 's going on ? And how did he get the coin ? I gave it to him . What ? He told me your mom 's plan . You want this coin ? You 're gonna have to shoot me . [ Muffled screams ] Listen , Claudia . Listen to me . I am undercover . The whole thing has been a setup . Mrs. F fired me in Atlanta , Jane and the Regents burning me- - my mission is to gain Sykes ' trust , so I can learn what he 's planning . Now can you calm down , now ? Yeah ? But you Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . Better than letting Marcus shoot them . I wish ... That you could look in my eyes and see that I 'm not lying . I 'm still on your side , Claude . I always have been . I am so sorry that I didn 't tell you the truth , but it was the safest way . Whatever Sykes is planning is bad for everyone in the Warehouse . I 've never seen anyone so filled with hate . Then , get out of there . Why are you taking this huge risk , getting chummy with those psychos ? Because ... I couldn 't save my sister . But I can protect you . [ Sighs ] Show this to Pete and Myka . It 's where he is . And don 't make a sound till you know I 'm gone . Cover your ears . So brave . [ Gunshots ] [ Sighs ] That 's why Jane couldn 't tell us . Steve is the plan . It all rests on him . He volunteered . He had a lot of experience going undercover at ATF . And he 'd been here the briefest . It would seem more plausible that he would turn than anyone else . Why did he help Sykes find Emily Lake and H.G. ? Without him , it wouldn 't have happened . His orders were to embed himself . Learn what Sykes ' plan is . And even assist him when needed . When Sykes enters his end game , Agent Jinks will get us a message . Oh , we got the message . Skybrook Three . It 's a decommissioned airport in Featherhead . It must be hanger three . That son of a bitch was under our noses the whole time . We 're on our way there now . Pete , be careful . I- - I love you , too , Mom . Let 's see if this really works , huh ? W-what are you doing ? What is that ? The end of Emily Lake ? No . Now , just remember . Just relax and remember . H.G. Wells ? It would appear you got to the coin before Pete could destroy it . You must be Mr. Sykes . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you . Um- - the plane 's ready if you wanna go . Steve , I want you to know none of this would have been possible without your help , buddy . Damn it , they 're gone . Too late . Pete ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . They 're gone . Let 's get back to the car . What 's wrong ? Claudia , I said get back to the car ! Pete ? What is it ? Please get back to the car . Pete ... = = sync , corrected by elderman = = No ! Claudia ! Claudia !

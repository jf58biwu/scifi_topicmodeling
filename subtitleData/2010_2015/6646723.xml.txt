 This is mckewan . I 'm at GPS coordinates 48.98 by 32.316 on vinci Ridge Nine Miles South of The main town of ascension . Test beacon 21 has Recorded another occurrence At 010-hundred . We 're commencing The next imaging testing . I 'm initiating sequence In five , four , three , Two , and one . Mark . [ Rumbling ] What was that ? [ Beeping ] Okay , the graph 's Going crazy here . That was another . Ground temperature 's rising . I 'm getting readings From all over the Mountain . We got multiple occurrences In sector seven , sector nine . Check your vectors . I 'm calling control . We have multiple readings . Repeat , multiple readings On the anomaly . The singularity could be viable . Confidence is high . Repeat , confidence is high ! Do you copy ? Do not copy . Control , do you copy ? Mckewan ! [ Screams ] O 'Neil ! Are you okay ? Oh , my God ! Radio : Tracking system Has been activated . Secure the device . Priority is the device . [ Grunts ] Timber ! [ Rumbling ] Whoa ! Come on , boys . Greg rumbles more When he eats chili . [ Laughter ] Get back to work . Give me a hand over here , Will you ? Sure . Hey , Thomas ! Yeah , Joe ? Is this ours ? I found it over there By that tree . Never seen anything like it . Trying to get free satellite Again or something ? You think that could help ? [ Laughs ] [ Thumping ] Whoa , hey . What the hell was that ? [ Rumbling ] All right , get away From the trees ! What 's going on ? [ Rumbling ] You hear that ? [ Shouts ] Joe ! Come on ! Get that thing off his leg ! Oh , God ! Looks like it hurts ! Oh , I need a lawyer ! [ Laughs ] You know what it Looks like to me ? What ? You 're spending football Season on the couch . Oh , God , let it be Eight weeks . I 'm gonna get the truck , Get you some help , all right ? Okay . I hate mondays . Smitty ! Get on the phone and figure out What the hell that was And don 't take earthquake For an answer . No freakin ' earthquake ! All right , boys . It 's gonna hurt like hell , So let 's do it quick . All right . Wait , wait ! One , two , three ! Three . All right , be careful Of that leg . Putting on weight , huh ? You are one tough Son of a bitch , Joe . Joe ! Joe ! Hold on a second ! What ? What 's wrong ? Joe ? Joe ! Joe ! He 's dead . No , this is regarding The sensors on Lincoln . We think two of the boxes May be malfunctioning . I don 't know . That 's why I need someone Out there . Daniel ? Daniel ! What ? I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna have to call you back . Please just see what you can do . Okay , thank you . What is it ? Mount Lincoln again , Another 4.3 over the southwest Subduction zone . Look at that low-level reading . I knew something was off . It 's almost six minutes long . That 's not a tremor . It 's almost like A slow-moving plate shift . Can that be ? Well , you know , you didn 't Have to hit me with A coffee cup . I 'm a human being . I got feelings . Be happy I couldn 't Reach the stapler . You know what ? I 'm gonna have to go up there And do some field readings . This is not adding up . Wait , wait , wait . You 're gonna go up there ? Yeah . That volcano isn 't Listed as dormant . It 's extinct . It hasn 't so much as belched In thousands of years . You never lived up there . Place shakes all the time . May very well have Entered into a new phase . I will contact you When I get there . Let Dr. Hayes know . Isn 't this a bit rash ? I mean , shouldn 't you Just see if they can send Someone out to check ? It is gonna take a whole lot More than those printouts To convince the locals There is something up , Especially their Hard-headed sheriff . How do you know that ? He 's my Uncle . So long . Thomas . Sheriff . You okay ? Well , as okay as I 'm gonna be . Figure anything out ? No . Well , nothing conclusive . They 're gonna do an autopsy . That should tell us more . It 's the craziest thing , Sheriff . Well , you said that He broke his leg , right ? That was it ? Yeah . He got hit by a branch . He got busted up pretty good . I 've seen worse . We 've seen worse . I just wanted to get him Off the hill . I went to grab the truck . Maybe I shouldn 't have left . Okay , come on . You can 't blame yourself . So do you want me To give you a ride home ? No , no . You sure ? Yeah . I 'm good , sheriff . Thanks . I just want to figure out What happened up there . Yeah . [ Sighs ] What you got Going on here , pops ? I 'm not sure . See you stopped Taking your meds . No , I 'm still on ' em . Well , sort of . Doc 's gonna love that answer . Well , I 'm gonna Take ' em later . Make it harder to think . I need to be clear right now . What 's all this ? I 'm having a revelation , An epiphany of some kind , But it 's all coming at me So fast I can 't seem To organize it . Thought research Gave you headaches . It does . Are you aware that The Dietrich ice shield Collapsed yesterday ? 200 Miles of Glacial coastline gone ? No , pops , I 'm not . Scientists projected It would take 150 years For it to melt away And it was gone in 10 . There are unprecedented Hurricanes in the Atlantic . There are massive earthquakes on The cascade volcanic arc , even Worse shaking more than usual . Something 's happening , son , Something bad . Dad , I know you hate them . But , I mean , your meds . Maybe they could bring A little light Into the darkness . Dad ? You 're patronizing me . No , I 'm not , dad . Dad ? Have you seen my backpack , The one that holds The sleeping bag ? Hey ! What are you doing here ? There was an accident On the site today . I 'm sorry . What do you need Your backpack for ? Jerrod and I are going Camping for the weekend . Mount Lincoln ? Yep . Yeah , no , grace . Just give it a few days . We have no idea What happened up there . You can 't be serious . I 'm talking about a few days ! 'Til we figure out What caused the accident . I think I can handle A campout . Oh , for crying out loud , dad ! Hey , can you handle that ? What are you doing ? We 're trying to figure ... You know what ? Forget it . I gotta go . I appreciate the concern , But I 'm 20 , not 16 . Then why are you acting Like you 're 12 ? When you can follow Your own advice , Maybe I 'll do the same . I gotta go . [ Chuckles ] Thanks for the help , pops . I 've gotta get into town . I 'm way behind With Monica 's books . Yeah , well , no wonder . Dad , your meds ? Give me lift into town ? Deal . Let 's go . I 'm still picking up A signal . The terrain 's making it Difficult to navigate . No , that 's a negative . No status of the team . Have we heard anything From the rest of them ? [ Rumbling ] Hold on ! Hold on ! I got another quake Rolling through . I 'll call you back . [ Rumbling ] [ Bell rings ] Hi , Zoe . Hey , Professor , Thomas . Hey , Zoe . Thought I 'd come by And wrap up Monica 's books While she 's away on holiday . I 'd have come by earlier , But I got distracted . The ledger 's on The desk in the back . Thanks . See you later , Thomas . See you , dad . Hey , Thomas , is your dad Doing okay ? Yeah , I guess . Why ? I don 't know . I guess he seems A little distracted lately . Monica didn 't say anything ? He 's not messing up ? No , no , no , gosh , no , no . He 's great . I mean , I know he 's been Going through a rough time And everything and I guess I thought I should let you know . Thanks . You know , I really appreciate What you and Monica Have done for him , Letting him help out Around here . I know it 's not much , but , I don 't know , it 's good for him . Keeps his mind going Since he stopped teaching . I mean , it 's not charity Or anything . He figured out that tax thing . You know , who knew A classics Professor would be So good at accounting . [ Laughs ] Yeah , he 's pretty good when He puts his mind to something . Yeah . Can I get you something to eat ? No , I 'm good . Rain check . Okay , all right . Any time . See you later . Thomas ! Emily ! How are you ? I 'm fine . How are you ? Good , good , yeah . What are you doing here ? Work . Work ? Just doing some research , Plus couldn 't pass up the chance To live it up for A couple of days in ascension . You look great . Well , thanks . So what kind of research ? Oh , basically , you guys Are just shaking A little bit more than normal . Yeah , don 't I know it ? We had an accident today During one of the tremors . One of my crew Was actually killed . What ? Yeah . Do you know Joe Enfield ? No . Great guy , great friend . I 'm on the way to see His family right now . I 'm really sorry . If there 's anything I can do ... Nah , it 's fine . How long you in town for ? Not long . Just gonna take some readings . Maybe we can grab A bite sometime . Uh , yeah . Yeah , okay . Okay . It 's good to see you . Yeah , you , too . Here 's your sandwich , Professor , just the way You like it . Thanks , Zoe . Maybe there . Okay . What 's this ? Self-portrait ? Very funny . [ Laughs ] This is a creature The Mayans believed Lurked in the underworld And would one day rise up And exact revenge on society . I mean , why would the Mayans Think your creature Would want vengeance on them ? Reckoning . Well , what did they do ? Every culture has Its myths of eschatology , Destruction stories , End of time scenarios . Whenever a society Has been close to destroying Its surroundings Or on the brink of destroying The very earth that Gives it life , It 's always been stopped short Of annihilation by Outside forces often Beyond our comprehension . The Mayans believed it was This creature , But every culture Has its own version . Are you crazy ? [ Laughter ] I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have ... I don 't think so . [ Laughter ] [ Rumbling ] I hate those . No matter how long I live here , I will never get used to them . Oh , your drawings ! Oh , it 's all right . Never mind , never mind . [ Whistling ] [ Creaking ] [ Shouts ] [ Screams ] [ Telephone rings ] Hello ? Are you getting this ? Uh-huh . Something massive Happened here last night . Every box recorded it And there 's nothing wrong With the sensors . Yeah . This is not good . If this thing is Becoming active , it 's not doing Anything by the book . It 's a complete anomaly . I know . Why don 't you try and Get infrared from the satellite ? Call over to your friend Who interns at the observatory . See if they can send one . There 's got to be New lava tubes . The old ones will Be plugged and ... And what ? What would you say If I told you there were Dead squirrels at my feet ? I 'd tell you To watch your step . I 'm serious , mansey . I 'd say it sounds Like we have co2 leaking . All over the Mountain . I gotta go ! All right , come on , mutts ! Out you come ! There you go . So this is where You were at the time ? Yeah , right here . There was a tremor , Told the boys to get out Of the trees . Joe and I were looking At a piece of equipment . Then what ? That branch broke off , Came down and hit Joe , But he was lucid . He was conscious . I run over to grab the truck And , by the time I got back ... So where was he when ... [ Dog whimpers ] Munson ? Munson ? What 's wrong ? What 's wrong , buddy ? You okay ? What 's going on ? Thomas ! Stand up ! Huh ? Stand up right now ! Pick up the dog ! Pick him up ! Emily ? There 's a cloud Of co2 hovering Above the ground About three feet high . Anything inside It will suffocate . What ? Carbon dioxide is Leaking from the ground . You can 't see it or smell it . You just drift off to sleep . That 's what happened to Joe . Well , what are you Doing here ? Seismic readings are double What they were at this time Last month . And then with the surface Deformations and now These co2 emissions , I don 't want to be Presumptuous , but I think The Mountain is Becoming active again . Emily , I 'm sure you don 't Remember this , but we had much Larger tremors than this Back in ' 84 . I have been tracking ... And after all that time , The locals got scared And packed up Waiting for the worst To happen and nothing ever did . Before long , everybody Went back to normal . You can doubt me All you want , But there is co2 Leaking from this whole area Like a sieve ! It sounds like it already Killed a man ! You have an obligation to keep People off this Mountain ! Uncle Matt ! So now it 's Uncle Matt ? You owe me one . [ Whimpers ] No , that 's a negative . I can 't get to the site Via the main road . I need you to find me a guide , A local , somebody that knows The Mountain . I 'm telling you , There is a massive amount Of movement up here . Like I said , the ground is Moving beneath the topsoil , Maybe deeper . It 's forcing these fossils To the surface . Yeah , yeah , it 's coming in now . Can that be right ? We have a new report Published today . The effects of global warming Were made alarmingly clear By the scientific community , Although several Conservative groups still raise Concerns over Their authenticity . This despite The stunning collapse Of the Dietrich ice shelf Just days ago . More on the reaction To this accelerated phenomenon Following the station break . Grace ? Have you heard this ? We 're annihilating ourselves And nothing 's being done ! Something 's gonna happen ! Something has to happen to stop It before we destroy the world ! Dad , I just ... Look at these fragments , Right ? They almost piece together The awakening , The dragon 's breath , Like pieces of a puzzle . I don 't know what You 're talking about . The world is going To push back ! It always has ! It 's been in myth , It 's been in metaphor , It 's been in the stories . Dad , i ... Something is coming ! We have to be ready ! We have to be prepared ! Dad , I have to go , okay ? It 's like when tiamat , The embodiment of chaos , Opened her jaws To swallow marduk and Marduk fired an arrow down her Throat and into her belly . It was the only way to kill her ! Split her heart in two ! And tiamat was no more ! Okay . Dad , I have to go , But I 'll be back soon , okay ? I 'll be back soon . [ Voice cracks ] Hey . What does this look Like to you ? It was my lunch . This is a satellite image Of the area Indicating thermal readings . Tell me that is not A geothermal anomaly . They have to be magma pipes . Okay , these are The epicenter locations Of the tremors three days ago , Then two , then yesterday . Looks like They 're moving up the Mountain . Exactly . Think the Mountain 's Waking up ? I don 't know . The thing is , if the Mountain Really was becoming active , It would have done it already . It would have been very large And very violent and everyone In the town would Already be dead from the blast . But we 're not . Yet we 're not , which just Keeps leading me To the same conclusion . This is a geothermal anomaly , Some kind of force or energy That 's churning everything Up from underneath the area , Creating new lava pipes , Venting co2 . Okay , and what Would cause that ? You don 't know and You 're heading back up The Mountain to figure it out . Yeah . And you want me to go With you . No . Em ? You sure ? Yeah . [ Sighs ] Be careful up there . Don 't push it . Yeah . I 'll be fine . [ Rock music plays on radio ] Watch out ! You might hit something ! I 'm driving here . Stop ! Relax . Woo ! That doesn 't turn me on ! [ Laughing ] Stop it . What ? Hey , wait ! Thomas Walsh ? Yeah . Hi . Jack Murray . Hi . I 'm told no one Knows these mountains Better than you do . I know a little . Well , I was hoping You could help me out . I 'm with a company That 's looking to retrieve Some information from One of our outposts . I 'm a geologist . Yeah , we had some equipment fail Near vinci Ridge At our base camp , So I 'm just looking For a guide . Today 's not the best day To go up that Mountain , Jack , was it ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , whatever it is , It can wait . No . Actually , I 'm afraid it can 't . I 'm told you 're ex-military . You served under hardin . I am , was , helicopter pilot , 13th . Hardin 's a friend of mine . I called in a favor . He directed me to you . Look , I know it is A strange request , But I need to get up That Mountain to the equipment . There 's valuable Information up there . Valuable to who ? [ Laughs ] Well , until I get To the equipment , I can 't be certain of anything . Look , I just need a guide . You in good shape ? Yeah , I think so . All right . Leave in 10 . Thank you . You 're quiet . I mean , I 'm sorry About the off-roading . It 's not that . What is it ? I 'm fine . [ Sigh ] No . Look , I 'm sorry . I promised myself I wouldn 't let it bother me . It 's okay . What 's going on ? My family is nuts . My brother acts like my dad And my dad acts like A raving lunatic ! Hey . I used to have such A normal family . There is no such thing As a normal family . [ Laughs ] Well , there 's definitely Such a thing as a crazy one . Look , for the next couple Of days , it is gonna be Just you and me . No brothers , no dads , just us . Sound good ? Sounds good . Good . [ Thunder ] All right , here we go . [ Telephone rings ] Hello ? Daniel ? Emily ! You 're not on mount Lincoln , Are you ? Yeah , why ? Reception is terrible . There 's a lot of interference . Did you get the data I sent you ? I think I got most of it , But I have some more Troubling information . What is it ? There are cataclysmic reports Coming in from All over the globe . I mean , yesterday I saw Reports of tsunamis Off the coast of Indonesia While Japan was Rocked by an 8.4 . I mean , there were Devastating tremors From the middle east Across Europe . What are you talking about ? Something 's happening . It 's global . Any commonalities ? I checked the lab Satellite imaging and There are strains of Heat signatures Reaching across the planet . Origination ? Ascension . Okay , do you have any idea What any of this means ? Well , I don 't ... You 're breaking up . Emily ? Daniel ? Emily ? Daniel ? [ Rumbling ] Oh ! [ Shouts ] William , you 're just Gonna have to forgive me . I 'm just not following you . It 's all significant ! Something 's happening , Something huge . What ? Just what do you think it is ? It 's the thrashing . It 's some kind of awakening . It 's like a life force Breathing against itself . I 'm very concerned . William , now you and I go Back a long way , right ? We 've certainly lived here Long enough to survive The occasional rumble . I mean , nothing 's changed . But it has , sheriff . The signs are everywhere . It 's all across the globe ! Yeah , but that 's all part Of the natural progression Of things . It has been since The dawn of man . No , not this time , sheriff ! The myths are clear . From the depths of obscurity Ascends a creature with one Purpose and one purpose only . Well , what 's that ? To destroy civilization . [ Sighs ] Well , what about Thomas ? What about grace ? What about them ? I 'm talking about everyone . Well , I 'm not ! I 'm talking about your family . I 'm talking about your kids . With all due respect , Sheriff , you don 't understand . William , listen to me And you listen to me good . Get help ! Take your medication . Do whatever it is you have To do to cope with Whatever you 're going through ! You do it . You do it or , so help me , I 'll see to it that Somebody does it for you ! This really the best way ? It 's the only way . Right . Be careful getting Too close to the ground . Co2 's leaking out everywhere . Someone told me it might be A sign the Mountain 's waking up . What do you think about that ? Could be . Yeah , could be . We getting close ? It 's a little bit further . Who 'd you say You work for again ? I didn 't . [ Rumbling ] Whoa ! Uh , that 's another one . I hope this isn 't a bad idea . Relax . The safest place to be Is on the Mountain . My dad told me during The massive quake In ' 72 that half the buildings In ascension were ruined , But nothing happened To the Mountain structures . Good , because I want Tonight to be perfect . What ? Huh ? Uh , nothing . What are you talking about ? I just want us to have A perfect weekend together . It has been way too long and We 're away from your friends . Hey ! Sarah and Evelyn Are my best friends . They 're like family . Your non-crazy family ? Hey , grace , I didn 't ... I know what you meant . I ... Look , it 's okay for me To say it , but not you . I know . You 're right . Look , that might be unfair , But that 's just the way it is . I 'm sorry . [ Sighs ] Just no talking For 10 minutes . Deal , totally . Good job , jerrod . [ Rumbling ] This is it . What the hell happened here ? Don 't touch anything . Gladly . What branch of the military You working for again ? What ? What branch of The military you working for . Said you worked under hardin . What is this ? Government contracts ? Black ops ? You wouldn 't know . Trust me . Try me . Look , Thomas , the only thing I can tell you is that We 've been detecting Seismic activity On this Mountain for some time . We set up a team To investigate it . We lost contact with them . What were they looking for ? These are the coordinates . To what ? Thought we were looking For this place . No , that 's only part of it . What I need is up there . You need to get me up there . It 's about a mile from here . It 's rough country . And I 'm not going One step further . Thomas ! Em ! Are you all right ? What happened ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Some boulders just shot out of A rock face I was near , Almost like ... Where was this ? Not far . Who are you ? He 's a geologist . Okay , look , Thomas , We need to get back To ascension . This thing is gonna blow and , When it does , it 's gonna take Everything with it . All right , fine . Look , my trucks Not far from here . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait a minute ! Thomas , I need you To guide me up that hill . Look , if she says It 's time to clear out , That 's what 's happening . Fine . Tell me how to get there . Experienced hikers And climbers have trouble With that area . You 're never gonna make it . Can 't this wait ? No ! No , it can 't . Travel this direction A half mile . You reach an impasse . You make it over , You 'll be in the vicinity . Good luck . Come on , I 'll take you down . This is it ! It 's here ! It 's here . It 's okay . I 'm not mad . Promise ? I promise . Why are you so nervous ? I 'm not . So , this is the spot ? Yep . I used to come here a lot When I was growing up . Yeah , you said that . It means something to you , Doesn 't it ? Well , minus the rain . [ Laughs ] Yeah , it does . We 've been dating for , What , four years now ? Yep . And we have known Each other since we were kids ? The second grade . Right , when I asked you To be my girlfriend And you kicked me in the knee . Ow ! Like that ? Yeah , like that . [ Laughs ] I can 't imagine a life Without you in it . Me neither . What are ... Grace Walsh , Will you marry me ? That wasn 't there before . Was that there before ? [ Growling ] What ? Hey ! What ? [ Shouts ] Let 's get outta here ! Run , run , run , run , run ! Uncle Matt ! Emily , you okay ? Look , Uncle , it 's worse Than I thought , much worse . I know . I got all that from before . I 'm closing down the Mountain To the general public . That 's a good start , But it 's not nearly good enough . I need you To evacuate the county . Excuse me ? Between the readings We 've gathered up there And the ground Temperature increasing , You know as well as I do This is way outside The ordinary . Well , out of The ordinary , sure . But come on , evacuate ? There are fissures opening up All over the Mountain ! Emily , when you lump it All together like this , I know how it sounds . But all this can be explained . Uncle Matt ! In 1984 ... This is not ' 84 ! She 's right , sheriff . The whole area 's unsafe . Soil we found up there Was littered with hot pumice And ash . The material on mount Lincoln Is known to have interlay Deep within its soil , Which means it Is being forced up From underground . Emily , it 's ... Days , days before Mount St. helens blew , Seismic activity Was half of what We 're recording right now . Ground temperatures Were lower and there were No gaseous emissions ! So what do you suggest ? Get everyone out At least 10 to 20 Miles away . 20 Miles ! Give us a window to see what Mount Lincoln has in store ! And if nothing happens , What then ? Then at least We 've taken precautions . But if it does blow , And I think it will , You 'll have saved Hundreds of lives . [ Sighs ] All right , I 'll make the call . Thank you , thank you ! But I truly hope that You are wrong about this . Me , too . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . It was alive ! Let 's just get to The bottom of the Mountain . A giant eye or something ! Let 's go ! Go , go , go , go ! [ Beeps ] [ Radio static ] Hello ? Hello ? This is agent Murray . Can you hear me ? Affirmative . Proceed . I 've salvaged the flash drive From the remains of site 14 . The information on The drive is correct . The team discovered The epicenter of the entity And we are running out of time . Conclusion ? We 're facing A singularity event . I repeat , we are facing A singularity event . [ Panting ] [ Growling ] What was that ? What ? Did you hear something ? No . It 's nothing . I thought I heard ... What the hell is that ? I don 't know . Where 's that smoke Coming from ? There must be something That think pushed up From under the ground . It 's huge ! I don 't know . It looked like it Just pushed it up . Do you think it 's inside ? Jerrod ! Jerrod ! Huh ? What ? Just stay close . I don 't wanna Be here anymore . I know , I know . I know you don 't . Hey , I am not gonna Let anything happen to you , But the only way that We are gonna get out of this Is that we make it down And we stay calm , okay ? Okay , okay . It 's gonna be fine , It 's gonna be fine . Let 's just get outta here . Hold my hand . [ Rumbling ] Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You ? Yeah . Okay . Let 's get outta here ! Keep moving ! [ Feedback ] All right , ladies and Gentlemen , if I could have Your attention , please ? We have to evacuate the town . I 'm hereby ordering you To evacuate to at least 20 Miles outside of ascension . Now I know that we 've had Drills like this before . We 've had some tremblers And rumblers , but this one , Although it is not immediate , It is imminent And we 're gonna ask You to leave town . So I want you go home right now , Get your kids , your valuables , Your pets , get in the car And get out of town As soon as possible . Thomas , Thomas , It 's happening . Dad , dad , dad . Now 's not the time . Look , we gotta leave , all right ? They 're evacuating the town , So get to the truck . We 're leaving . What about grace ? Well , we 're gonna get her At the house . She 's not there . She 's already gone . Oh no . She 's gone up the Mountain . Now ? Why would she do that ? 'Cause she has no idea All this is going on . All right , I gotta go up And get her . Well , she could be anywhere . No , she 'll be At Hudson clearing . It 's where she 's been going Since she was a kid . Well , can we call her ? There 's no reception . All right , dad , listen . This is important , all right ? I need you go to down To Olympia , all right ? Go to aunt Evelyn 's house And wait there ' til we get back . Thomas ... No , dad , dad ! This is not up for discussion . I 'm gonna go with you . What ? No ! I 'm gonna go with you ! You sure ? Yeah . All right . Get your gear . Thomas , I want you To take this . Now dad ... Your mother gave this To me years ago to protect me . You should keep it . It 's a sacred piece From the puyallup tribe . I want you to take it . Dad , you keep it . Come on . Thomas , please ? Just wear it for me ? All right , All right , dad , fine . Olympia , aunt Evelyn 's , please ? Got it . All right . [ Sighs ] What 's going on ? What is this ? Sheriff is evacuating The town . Evacuating ? Where am I supposed to go ? You can come with me . We 'll figure the rest later . Professor , this is crazy ! Zoe , we have to go now ! Grab your things ! But hold on a second . I gotta do something . Zoe ? How far away is the clearing ? A little bit further . What the hell was she thinking ? She 's young . She probably just wanted To get away . Away from what ? Her understanding Older brother ? You went away , too , If you don 't remember . Yeah , well , military Was my only option . Well , grace was Still really young . She had to grow up faster Than you , faster than all of us . I know your dad Probably can 't be much help . Well , he still has Plenty of good days . Just never got over losing mom . Deep down , I 'm sure She 's scared to death To see him this way . Yeah , well , I don 't Really understand it either . I mean , I understand loss . I understand grief . I just ... I don 't know . Seems like he can 't handle Reality , so he creates This world that he can live in And control . I don 't know . Is that why you left ? No . Well , maybe , I don 't know . We had planned To go away together , Remember ? Sometimes things Just don 't work out The way you planned . Hello ? Do you hear that ? Yeah , yeah . This way . Hello ? Jack ? What happened ? I busted up my leg On the impasse . Told you it was a bitch . Yeah . Think it 's broken ? No , I don 't think so . Can you stand ? Yeah . Oh ! You got it ? Yeah , I think so . You need to get back Down the hill . Sheriff 's evacuating The whole county . No , I can 't . What are you guys Doing back here ? Looking for my sister . You need to get to A hospital . I need that case . Jack , you can barely walk . Thomas , you know what It 's like to follow orders . Do what you 're told In order to save lives . That is the situation I 'm in . I need that case ! What is so special About this case ? Em ? All right , look , We 're headed that direction . If you can keep up and , If we pass by it , We 'll grab it , but that 's it . No , no ! We need to get grace and get The hell off this Mountain , Not chase down equipment ! What is this about ? I 'm not sure . [ Rumbling ] It 's coming from ascension . Zoe , I cannot stress The urgency of This situation enough ! We have to go ! I can 't just leave this here . It 's my responsibility . It doesn 't matter ! We have to go now ! [ Rumbling ] Professor ? Run ! Run ! It 's not just A piece of equipment . Well , what is it then ? That 's the million Dollar question . What 's the government Doing up here ? You don 't wanna know . Well , why are you up here For geothermal anomalies Or is it something else ? Something you 're doing up here ? Jack , you asked for our help . Fill us in . Why are you up here ? Okay . Six months ago , my office Recorded a subsonic boom In the pacific ocean . Russian , Japanese , American subs , They all picked it up . Exactly the same time A similar sound was heard At eight different locations Across the globe . The strongest source was Traced back here specifically A mile below mount Lincoln . Why didn 't we hear it ? It was completely Subterranean . It 's like we felt it and Never even acknowledged it . We picked up a spike in About six months ago , But we recorded it As a sensor glitch . We picked up the same Glitch a few days ago . It wasn 't a glitch . Every one of my teams Recorded the same thing . Then why weren 't we warned ? About what , Thomas ? A big boom ? We sent a team to investigate And gather information . They were trying to confirm The possibility of A singularity event . What the hell is A singularity ? A singularity is an event That can single-handedly change The course of life As we know it . A volcano ? No , not quite . We believe that an event Of this magnitude Occurred 30,000 years ago And again 15,000 years ago . We believe it 's gonna Happen again right here . This case is ... I need this case . [ Rumbling ] [ Growling ] [ Shouting ] Come on . You okay ? What the hell was that ? I have no idea . Let 's get the hell outta here ! Where 's Jack ? Where 's Jack ? Jack ! Jack !

He told me that a monster Was gonna destroy the world . All along he was telling me That something was coming , But I thought he was crazy , So I left and I didn 't listen . All we have to do Is just find a way out Of here as soon As possible , okay ? I know . Come on . [ Rumbling ] [ Groans ] Oh , my God , are you okay ? Yeah . Are you ? Are you all right ? Oh , I think so . What 's happening ? I think we 've fallen Into a sinkhole . We 're buried underground ? Looks like it . Well , how far down are we ? I mean , what caused this ? I 'm not sure .

The diner 's intact , Zoe . We have to find A way out of here . My cell ! There 's no signal . How can there be no signal ? Zoe , stay calm . No , no , no ! We 've gotta stay calm . We 'll find a way out of here . I 'll go check the back . You check the back . I 'm gonna check the windows . [ Banging ] Oh , my God ! It 's here . No ! What is that ? [ Screams , cries ] [ Beeping ] There it is . All right , I gotta go down And get it . No . We gotta get grace And get outta here Or we 're not gonna make it ! What if Jack was right ? Even more reason To get moving ! What if that 's the only thing That can stop it ? It doesn 't matter ! What if it does ? I was right ! I knew it would come ! Professor , You 're freaking me out . I knew something Was happening . I just didn 't expect it To happen right under our feet . What are you doing ? I think it 's gone now . Its displacement was what Caused the diner to collapse . Wasn 't so hard , was it ? All right . You ready ? One , two , three ! [ Grunts ] No ! We can 't stop it , But we can buy some time . Tape for the cracks In the windows ? Yes , yes , yes ! Get some duct tape ! Quickly ! Come on ! Here , you tear off pieces And I 'll put them on . Okay , okay . Here . In myth , it was called The dragon 's breath , But science has identified It as carbon dioxide . Myth and reality Have become one . Couple more pieces And we 've got it . Just , um ... Zoe ? Zoe ! No , Zoe ! Zoe ! Stand up , stand up and stay away From the windows . You have to stay away From the ground . Professor , what are You talking about ? Zoe , you have to concentrate . It 's carbon dioxide . It 's invisible and it 's heavier Than air and it 's deadly And it 's seeping Through the windows . If we don 't be careful , We 'll suffocate . I mean , do you think That 's gonna hold ? I don 't ... Yes , yes , for now , But we have to find a way Out of here quickly . [ Rumbling ] [ Cries ] How ? I 'll find us a way . [ Panting ] Okay .

No , Zoe , no , we won 't . When my wife died , I just shut down . I couldn 't teach , I couldn 't do anything . All I could think of Was fate and destiny . I did all that research On ancient myths And folklore trying to find A meaning for it all . We were trapped inside that car . She died right beside me . There was nothing I could do to save her . I had to find out why . Sometimes ... Just sometimes There 's a second chance . Do you understand me , Zoe ? I understand , yeah . Watch your step . Stay to the side . Will everything be okay ?

Let 's go , let 's go , go ! What the hell was that ? I have no idea , But let 's get the hell Out of here ! It 's no use . The back is jammed tight . I don 't understand Why this is happening . The world is tipped Too far in one direction . The great flood , the plague , Disease , famine , They 're all modern forms Of the world keeping itself In balance . Sometimes the damage Is so severe it takes A force so ... So dominant that mankind Simply has to pay attention . A behemoth so foreboding that The only way to stop it is ... What are you saying ? This is a creature that has Existed before history , Before time , Risen from its slumber When the world is at its worst , On the brink of annihilation . It 's as if we 're in the belly Of the whale and The only way out Is to go through . There is a way out ! Oh , my God , the hatch ! You found it ! We can climb through that And get to the top of the diner ! Oh , let 's get a ladder ! [ Crying ] Jerrod , no ! Come on . I 'm so sorry , Sweetheart , I am . He asked me to marry him .

We 'll hook up with the lockman Trail and be able to get over To the ranger station . Why there ? Forest services uses it As a spot-fire landing zone . Should be a helicopter . Well , what if there isn 't ? There will be . Shouldn 't we Just hike it down ? You really want to hike Back down through that mess ? No . We 're gonna get away From this creature , okay ? All right . [ Growling ] All right , come on , let 's go , Let 's go . [ Grunts ] There ! Okay , okay , yeah . Come on . Careful . Stay calm now . Now you go up first .

What is it ? What ? What are you talking about ? He told me Where to shoot the creature . He was talking about A marduk or something ! No , no ! It was tiamat ! Tiamat , the embodiment of chaos ! Tiamat opened up its jaws Around the marduk And then it shot an arrow Down his throat into his belly And split its heart in two . What does that mean ? It split its heart in two ! Shoot it in the mouth . [ Roars ] Oh , hell , Looks like a mouth to me . [ Beeps ] Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go !

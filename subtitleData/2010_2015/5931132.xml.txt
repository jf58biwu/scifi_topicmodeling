 Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day , it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever . But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Angie is dead . Oh , my Lord . You point the finger at me ? - Neither of us would do this . - So then who would ? Is it possible to love someone so much that you 'd hurt them ? But you 'd never do anything violent to the person you loved , would you ? First we lose Linda . Now Angie . I thought the dome was supposed to protect us . No , it 's up to us to protect each other . There are too many people in here for our limited resources . We can 't all survive . - Who is she ? - Hey , what 's your name ? It was the girl we saw in the woods . We found her bloody shoe print at the school . This looks like her . Pauline drew this ? Twenty years ago . I was just looking . - For what ? Reminders . I feel like I know you from somewhere . Your license says you 're from Zenith . You 're not from here ? - Where are you from ? - I don 't know . Are you interrogating her ? No , I 'm ... I 'm just trying to figure out who she is , okay ? We don 't even know her name . Try to be patient with her . I 'm sorry , I 'm not buying this whole little baby bird act . - It 's not an act . - Are you sure about that ? Because I just came in here and found her going through my stuff . I just want you to be more careful about bringing strays into our house . Well , let 's not forget the last stray that I brought in was you . I 'm gonna head down to the diner . Jim 's mandatory citizen registration ? Can I come with you ? Of course you can . Do you think someone will recognize me ? We 'll figure it out , sweetie . What 's that scent ? It 's a dram of cassia oil . It 's nice , huh ? Could you make a cologne ? For you ? Yeah . - You got a big date ? - It 's been nine years since , uh ... - Pauline passed . - Yeah . Yeah , I still think about her every day . So I was , uh , grateful for your support during that time . It couldn 't have been easy , given your history with her . Better man won that battle , Jim . Who 's this lucky lady ? Rebecca Pine . She 's a science teacher at the high school . We 've been working together . Let 's just say there 's something interesting about her . If you want , I could whip up a fragrance for you , Jim , and get your pheromones kicking . I 'd appreciate that , Lyle . None of that , uh , cassia oil though . Comes off a bit feminine . What are you smiling about ? I don 't know , just something about the day seems auspicious . I 'll expect you later at the Sweetbriar for the registration . Yeah . Yeah , see you down there . Answer every question to the best of your knowledge . This survey will provide us with the proper information to get everyone the resources they need . Should I look around ? Yes . I 'll be right here . Has that girl remembered anything about Angie yet ? Don 't worry . We 're gonna find the person who killed her . Also , there were four hands a couple days ago . Now with my sister gone , there 's only three . Would the dome let her die ? What if we were wrong ? - And the dome isn 't here to protect us ? - I don 't know . If you don 't know , who will ? I noticed you didn 't have one of these . - Thank you . - I 'm just helping out . Joe ? Hi . I need a favor . Can you open up the project room and make sure it 's prepped ? Remember that windmill project we did on alternative energy ? - I still have the specs on my tablet . - Great , bring it . We 're gonna be replicating the concept on a much larger scale to generate electricity for the town . Cool . - You can take your friend . - I don 't go to school here . Well , everyone between 14 and 18 is expected to participate . And there goes the last perk of dome-living . Do you recognize anyone ? - You can help out too . - No . She stays with me . - Help with what ? - An experiment . It 's okay . I 'd like to help . Look out for her . So you 're really embracing your new responsibilities , aren 't you ? Well , I serve at the pleasure of our councilman . Please fill that out . Why torture yourself if you don 't know ? Angie 's bracelet was under my cot . You loved her , right ? More than anything . Do you really think you could have killed the person you loved more than anything ? No . I don 't know . Why can 't ... ? Why can 't I remember ? The night Angie was killed , you said you blacked out . Those were the words you used . I don 't know what this means ... It might not mean anything . - But your mom , she had blackouts too . Fugue states , the doctor called them . Dissociative or something like that . What would happen to her when she had them ? Would she get violent ? What 's important is that sometimes afterward , she 'd go back to where she was when the blackout hit . And she would get these flashes . Glimpses , little bits of memory coming back . So I should go back to where I found Angie . Maybe something will come back . Hey , James . No matter what , you and me are family . We 'll figure this out . All right , folks . Grab any receptacle you can find , folks . Let 's go . Precipitation 's scarce . Let 's collect as much drinkable water as we can . She 's a little bossy , don 't you think ? Wait . It 's raining blood . It can 't be blood , can it ? I don 't think it 's cherry Kool-Aid . - It burns . - Let 's go wash it off . Come on . All right , listen up , everybody . Stay calm and stay inside . Don 't leave the cafe till the rain stops , all right ? - Jim . - Yeah ? You know what this is about , don 't you ? The ten plagues . Lyle , don 't start getting all biblical on me now , okay ? But that swarm the other day , that may have as well been locusts . Butterflies are not locusts , Lyle . Jim , it 's like three plagues rolled into one . Storm of fire , boils , and water turns to blood . It 's not blood . How do you know ? Well , blood doesn 't burn . But it doesn 't usually fall out of the sky either , but take a look . There was a red rain phenomenon in India a decade ago . It was caused by spores from an abnormal algae bloom . I 'm looking at scripture to tell me what this is . What are you looking at ? Science , like when the dome magnetized , or the crops were infested . So you 'll solve everything , huh ? You and science ? Or go down trying , okay . Um , I collected a sample . I can analyze it and look for a way to neutralize the acidity . - Little help . - Put her down over there . I 'm glad you 're here . We 've got people who might need medical attention . - Burning skin ? - Yup , everybody 's stable . Excuse me . We should go back out . I saw other people stranded out there . There 's an ambulance at med center . That 's close by . Cover up . Let 's go . What is it ? It 's just ... What are you doing here ? - Homework . - What about you ? Same . Anyways , I 'm gonna take off now . - You can 't . - Why not ? You haven 't been outside for a while , have you ? Apocalypse . - What did you say ? - The apocalypse , what Lyle was talking about . You believe in that ? I believe in the original definition of apocalypse . It 's Greek . To uncover or reveal . That 's what crises do . They reveal character . Strength . Or not . You think we 're being tested ? I mean the rain , infestation , everything . You think it 's a test from the dome ? To see whether I 'm worthy ? Jim , we can solve this . The red algae must have come from the lake which could 've gotten toxified from everything we 've been dumping in it . Not to mention , um , pesticides , trash fires , trapped exhaust from cars . The town 's an environmental horror show . And we 're stuck inside . Believe in me , and I will believe in you . Science and faith , huh ? Look out ! Is he okay ? I don 't think he 's ever been okay . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . - Will you give me a hand ? - I didn 't hear a bell . Come on , Norrie , there 's an extra tablet on the shelf . We gotta look up the specs on the windmill . Oh , my God . What is it ? E-mail . I 'm getting e-mail . This is Big Jim on Motton Road . Across from Killian 's . Send help . Look at this . We 're super-trendy in Twitter-Land . Who 's hounds of diana ? They 're all over my page . Are they messages ? Yeah . First since the dome came down . I don 't know how the signal 's getting through though . It 's from my dad . What does it say ? " Your mother and I pray every day that we 'll get to see you soon . In the meantime , stay safe and be smart . You 're the man of the house now . Take care of your sister . " What do I even say ? Do I even tell them that Angie 's dead ? What if we never even get out of here ? I mean , wouldn 't it be better if they just didn 't know ? If they 're never gonna see her again anyway . We 'll figure it out , sweetie . Feel like checking your messages ? There 's only so much fake-ass fan mail from wannabe dome-groupies I can read before I barf all over this wonderful piece of machinery . - No , thanks . - We 're stuck in here . What else are you are gonna do ? Build windmills ? " I can help you , James . " Jim . Respond if you 're hearing this . That 's the Killians ' farm . - Here ? - There . There he is . Julia , wait here . Get the kit ready . Jim . He 's barely breathing . Let 's get him up . Come on . It could be anaphylactic shock . Hey . Hey ! Oh , hey . Guess you woke up . Where 's Big Jim ? Guess where I left him . What did you do to him ? He 's gonna be tickled you 're this concerned with his well-being . What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . If he 's righteous , the rain will spare him . Thing is , I 've known that guy my whole life , and righteousness ? That 's not something that ranks high on his list of attributes . Self-righteousness , yeah . Yeah , he 's got that in spades . Listen . You have to let me out . This rain , I know how to stop it and nobody else will get hurt . If you untie me , it 'll be like you 're helping me to stop it . So help me . Help me stop it , Lyle . Yeah , I ... I don 't want to stop the rain . And neither does the dome . The dome ? The dome does not want . You know why Yahweh visited the plagues on the Egyptians ? To demonstrate his awesome , terrible power to non-believers . They were swallowed up by the Red Sea . Yeah . This isn 't Yahweh . There 's a new god in Chester 's Mill . It surrounds and embraces us all . And it 's gonna show no mercy to infidels . You got a choice , Rebecca . I just pray you make the right one . What happened to him ? He must 've ingested too much of whatever 's in that rain . - Hand me that pack . - Hold on , you put that in , he 's not gonna be able to talk . Hey , what happened to Rebecca ? Lyle . It was Lyle . What 's that for ? I don 't wanna hurt you . But I can 't have you interfering with the plan . What plan ? The End of Days . After this rain stops , the rapture comes . True believers are gonna be reunited in the hereafter . If you stop interfering with the plan , I won 't have to hurt you . I 'll never stop . I 'm sorry to hear that , Rebecca . I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance , but he that cometh after is mightier than I. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire . James . My love . My sweet son , by this time now , I expect you know , or have at least suspected the truth . That I 'm alive . I hope , I pray , that you get this message . You must have so many questions . And I know in my heart that I will see you again . But in the meantime , if you need answers , talk to Lyle Chumley . James , this is important . Please listen . Talk to Lyle . Only to Lyle . And if my ... No , no , no . Come on , come on . Joe , Joe , what happened ? It 's so strange . Mine just did the same thing . We can 't get access anywhere now . My tablet 's working and the signal 's still coming through , but there seems to be some kind of block . - What are you doing ? - I gotta go find someone . Junior . No , you can 't go outside . It 's dangerous . I always thought Lyle was harmless . Given the right circumstances , anybody 's capable of anything . You really believe that ? I believe that when things fall apart , people show their true colors . So , what , everyone 's bad in the end ? This is the perfect time to be having a debate over the nature of man . These past few weeks , haven 't you also seen people acting selflessly , bravely ? That 's the exception to the rule . If this town 's gonna survive , it 's gonna need a firm hand to keep everybody in check . Like Big Jim 's ? Julia , look at this . " Summer ' 88 . Lyle , Sam and Pauline . " Sam ? Sam , you there ? I 'm here , Julia . We 're at Lyle 's shop . He 's not here , but we found something . A photograph . Of what ? You , Lyle and Pauline , in 1988 . They 're holding hands . Yeah , that 's right around the time he was seeing my sister . You never mentioned that . It was 25 years ago , Julia . I didn 't even think about it until now . And I haven 't spoken to Lyle since she died . Well , do you have any idea where he might be ? Wish I did . If you find him , let me know . I got people to tend to here . What are you doing here ? Heard you over the police radio . I thought I 'd help out . Great . Here , look at this . Any idea where this was taken ? This is my mom before she met my dad . Uh , it 's by the cement factory . I used to build forts there when I was a kid . Well , let 's give it a shot . See if Lyle took her there . So there 's still a block ? Yeah , we can 't get access , but the signal 's still coming through . Maybe that means there must be , I don 't know , a crack . In the dome ? Joe , they fired their biggest , baddest bomb at it , and it didn 't even make a dent . I don 't mean , like , literally . What if the magnetism caused some sort of , I don 't know , wormhole ? All I 'm saying is , if we found the source of this signal , we might find a way out . You wanna go look ? Come on . Why ? Why 'd I save you ? I may not be on your team ... Hell , I may even hate your damn guts . - But that doesn 't mean I 'm gonna let you die . At least not yet . Rest up , Jim . Stop ! Stop . Wait , wait , wait . Please . Okay , okay , all right . Okay . Are you willing to accept the grace of repentance ? I was wrong . The rain , it 's a test . A test of my worthiness . Whose test ? The dome . I believe that now . Are you prepared to surrender ? Yes , yes . I believe in its plan . I do . No , you only believe in what you can see . Science . You 're a lost cause . And now ... No , no , no . No , don 't . Don 't . You 're wasting my time . Drop it ! Drop it ! Put it on the ground ! Put it on the ground ! Put your guns down ! Put those guns on the ground . - Put it down . - On the ground . Put the guns on the ground now . There you go . Hey , I 'll shoot her right in front of you . Now , put that down . That 's right . Damn ! What is wrong with you ? Lyle ? Please don 't hurt her . You know this rain is here to rid this town of non-believers . You know that . I heard you talking to those kids at the diner . You believe . Don 't you , lady ? I do . But I believe the dome is here to protect us . Only the faithful . No . All of us . How do you know that ? I know because the dome spoke to me . Maybe like it 's spoken to you ? Does the dome speak to you , Lyle ? No . It doesn 't speak to me . It 's a feeling directing my actions . Yeah , I understand . What did it say to you ? It says if you want the darkness to abate , you must earn the light . Earn the light ? Help me achieve the dome 's true plan . What is that ? I mean , its true plan ? I don 't know . But I have faith that the answers will be revealed . So give me the gun now , Lyle . Why did you do that ? He was about to give in . - Signal 's getting stronger . - Joe . The source is coming from down there . You don 't have to go . It 's coming from here . Joe , don 't be frightened . How about you don 't tell him how to be ? You 're not his girlfriend , and as far as I know you 're not anyone . Let 's just go . That locker was the last thing that she touched . She died right here . And maybe we should just leave it alone . I have a bad feeling about this . Eight . Seventeen . One . It 's empty . Now the signal 's gone . How did you know that combination ? Who the hell are you ? All right . It 's okay . Easy now . All right . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . - Lyle ? - He 's in jail . Trust me , he looks a lot worse than we do . The rain stopped . I stopped it . Not the dome . Me . How ? A mixture of salination with some high-pH compounds . It 's pretty science-y . I thought that stuff didn 't interest you . - It interests me . - Good . Because I took a tour of the town after the rain stopped . Our situation has only gotten worse . Some tough decisions need to be made . What kind of decisions ? Listen , bitch , I am so over this Little Miss Innocent scam you 're running . And we are not leaving until you come clean about how you knew that combination , and why the signal got blocked . I don 't know . What are you , a safecracker ? A magician 's assistant ? Because when we got here the locker was locked , and then presto , change-o , you opened it right up . Norrie , she doesn 't know . It was just like I saw it in my head . In your head ? In here ? What else is in there ? Is your name in there ? - Norrie , stop . - No ! She just shows up here without any explanation on the day your sister gets killed in front of that locker , and just happens to know the combination ? How did you know ? - How did you know ? - Leave me alone ! I 'm telling the truth . - Why don 't you trust her ? - She just saw it ? That doesn 't even make sense . How do you see a combination ? Actually , I think I might know . As I 've been telling Jim , we have a serious resource crisis to deal with . I thought that that 's what this whole registration drive was about in the first place , is about how to better allocate them . Yes , but it 's the lack of resources themselves that I 'm most worried about . Even before today , there were acute shortages . And after the rain ? Far fewer medical supplies , crops destroyed , a considerable amount of livestock decimated , especially in the pig population . Day 's coming when there won 't be enough food to sustain us . So we should have a contingency plan in case we run out of options . What kind of contingency plan ? It may become necessary ... Selectively , I 'm saying . - To thin the herd . Selectively ? The questions on your form : Family background , history of illness . This is a census to help you decide who lives and who dies . Let 's get out of here . She 's just talking about a contingency . Trouble in paradise ? Julia . Listen , you don 't understand . I understand you 're taking their side . No , no , no . I 'm not taking anyone 's side here . I 'm trying to consider every possible option . You said , " When things fall apart , people show their true colors . " Are these yours ? I need to know that you will stand with me against them , against that . They don 't get to throw anybody out of the life boat . - What if it 's sinking ? - I believe we will find a way . Belief only gets you so far . I thought I knew you . I was wrong . Don 't follow me . Long as I remember The rain 's been coming down Clouds of mystery pouring confusion On the ground Getting through the ages Trying to find the sun And I wonder , still I wonder Who 'll stop the rain I was wondering when you 'd show up . Aren 't you afraid of people seeing us together ? Building 's empty . I could kill you and nobody 'd know . Nobody 'd care . Maybe . But you won 't . When this thing came down , I told you to lay low . Follow my lead . I got a new leader . You made a promise , 25 years ago , to make sure that what we buried stayed buried . You 've heard of force majeure , yeah ? Extraordinary circumstance that frees both parties from a contract . But you know what ? This dome is about as majeure a force as it gets . But it 's gonna deliver us to a better place . I 'm afraid you got that exactly backward , pal . I grow weary of this conversation . See you on the other side , Sammy . I read about a tribe in Borneo . I can 't remember what they 're called . But they had this ritual , something that they would do every year . They 'd put all their elderly , their infirm , up into a tree and they would shake it . And whoever held on was considered strong enough , useful enough , to make it to the next year . And those who couldn 't hold on ? Look . When I said the day was coming we wouldn 't have provisions enough to sustain the population , that was a bit of a cheat . That day isn 't coming . It 's now . The way I calculate it , we can all starve , or with proper rationing and cultivation , three-quarters of us can survive . And how do you propose to do that ? Shake the tree ? You could use the information we gathered today to determine who 's an asset and who 's a burden . Those hard choices could be made , but not by me . Dome chose you to make them . And you 've gotta do it now . Before it 's too late . Hey ! Man . We need to talk . I guess you found out . That my mother 's alive ? She told me you 'd have answers . To some pretty provocative questions . Do you know who killed Angie ? I might . Is that what you and my uncle were talking about ? Hey , I need you to tell me everything ! I can do that . Provided you give consideration to my needs . - Which are ? - You let me out of here . I 'll give you an all-access pass . What do you say , James ? - What was the locker number again ? - Eighteen-twenty-one . Here we go . People who have had that locker over the last 50 years . Okay , what exactly are we looking for ? Anything to jog her memory . Wait . Melanie Cross ? That looks familiar to you ? Something about it . 1988 . I 'll pull the yearbook from that year . Brazier . Connor . Cross . How is this possible ? What ? What is it ? It 's me .

 PETE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... CLAUDIA : No ! I 'm taking the Metronome , I 'm bringing him back . Don 't think this is over . I will remember what I have to do and nothing will stop me from doing it . If you use the astrolabe , you will create an evil of your own making . Claudia 's gone . She disappeared in the middle of the night . BROTHER ADRIAN : An evil that will live with you the rest of your days . One of those times when you need to stop talking and listen , okay ? You 're not ... No , no , no ! You can 't do that without accounting for the variable . The variable ? Yeah , the variable . Dude , Eccentric Strength , Concentric Strength and Static Strength all being factored into the equation ... None of those are the variable I 'm talking about . Oh , no ? The variable is Resistance , okay ? Is the Resistance encountered greater than the overall Maximal Isometric Strength ? Yes ! Scrapple and eggs , times two . You 'll need this . I 've accounted for the variable , and given the copper-based physiology , the end result is ... ( LAUGHING ) The Vulcans are 47 % stronger than Klingons . Huh . I wonder why there 's never a girl with you two . The usual ? Yeah . ( SNARLING ) Sweet Lord ! What is that ? ( SNARLING ) ( SCREAMING ) Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! I 'm trying ! Somebody call 911 ! ( SNARLING ) It 's coming ! Oh ! It 's gonna kill us ! Then we 're gonna have to stop it ! Okay , okay . ( SIREN WAILING ) Go , go , go ! Police ! Freeze ! Break it up ! Come on ! Dispatch ! We need backup and an ambulance , now ! Oh , my God , that 's ... Dude , that 's ... That 's Joe ! I 'm not getting a pulse . Oh , my God ! Oh ! BROTHER ADRIAN : " An evil that will live with you the rest of your days . " No ! Artie ? No ! Artie ! Don 't worry . We 're gonna find her . MYKA : Just drink it , it 's protein . Artie ! Artie ! Hey , so what 's the plan ? Plan ? What plan ? The plan to help Claudia . Yeah . What other plan would there be ? Okay . So we know where she went , and we know what she 's after . Okay , technically we don 't know where she went . But I 'll bet you do . We are not helping Claudia . What ... What are you talking about ? We 're not stopping Claudia ? No . No . We are not doing anything . I will find Claudia . The two of you will be in Philadelphia . What are we supposed to do in Philadelphia ? Philadelphia ? It 's cold ! We got a ping . What is that ? Uh ... It 's cool is what it is . It 's a Pocket Ping Device . Claudia made it . For me ! Well , there you go , Artie . Another reason ... That 's another reason that we need to find ... Listen . Listen ! A mob in Philadelphia almost killed a young man in cold blood , claiming that they were attacked by some kind of , some thing ... Anyway , unless you want it to happen again , you will get there . Yesterday ! Yesterday ? What are we supposed to turn back time ? What ? What ? What ? What ? Nothing . Well , you 're the one that said ... I was being hyperbolic ! I 'm colorful . Just go . Go ! What are you doing here ? Sorry . I must 've gotten turned around outside . Why are you here ? I 'm looking for an Arthur Nielsen . My name is Adrian . Brother Adrian . I , uh , work with the Vatican . Yes , of course you do . I know , we 've met . No , we haven 't . No , I ... I don 't believe we have . Arthur Nielsen . Ah ! Excellent . Please . I need your help , Arthur , and the Warehouse . The Ware ... How do you know about the Warehouse ? Well , as I said before , I work with the Vatican . We know an awful lot of things about an awful lot of things . I understand you can locate certain items . Possibly . Something 's been stolen from my care . A very powerful something . And now I must get it back . Yes , it 's very powerful ... I mean , it must be very powerful for you to come all the way from the Vatican to ... Yes . And very dangerous . Yeah . I understand that , but what exactly ... Can you tell me what exactly the danger ... Magellan 's Astrolabe , to be precise . Oh ! Magellan 's Astrolabe . Interesting . It 's been used to erase 24 hours , and now the thief has to undo that act . Yes , but the danger . What exactly is the danger ? Undo ? What do you mean undo ? Using the astrolabe unleashes an evil . A formidable evil . An evil that has to be eradicated . And the only way to do that is to undo what the astrolabe did ? Yes . Yes . If the same person uses the astrolabe again , time will be reset . The evil never will have existed . And things will go back into exactly as they were ? Yes . But wouldn 't the person who used the artifact be aware of that danger ? I mean , clearly it is a risk they were willing to take ? No . A risk they might still be willing to take if circumstances were ... No . It was a mistake . It has to be undone . Now , will you help me , Arthur ? Of course . I 'm absolutely at your service . You can reach me at this number , anytime , day or night . Well , I will do everything in my power to find the person who used the astrolabe . Eradicating this evil is of the utmost importance . I cannot impress that upon you enough . Eradicating evil . It 's what we do . Please don 't worry about a thing . Delicious scones , by the way . Scones and evil . That 's what we do . Uh , just that way . Right . It was gonna kill us and fry us up for dinner , I swear ! Huh , well , maybe it was something in the food . Not a chance . I never eat the food in this place . I 've never seen anything like it , not even on Animal Planet . It was like a nightmare . Or an acid trip gone really , really bad . But you guys said that you weren 't drinking last night , right ? Or doing , you know , anything else ? No . Not even Red Bull and Ritalin . Dude ! Whatever it was , it was real . No , it wasn 't . It was Joe . He was supposed to meet us here , and we put him into a coma . Why would we do that ? We think that something affected you , made you see the ... Whatever it was that you think you saw . That 's why we 're here , to find out what it is . Now , did you guys come into contact with anything weird here at the diner ? Like , uh , an old plate maybe , or , ooh , a ladle ? Never mind . It 's ... Can we go ? Yeah , you can ... Yeah . Let me guess . They couldn 't make it out , but it was big and red and had lots of tentacles . Blech ! I hate tentacles . Yeah , well , you 're not gonna like this case . It 's a veritable tentacles-a-palooza . They said that they were sober . I used to say that a lot . Yeah , but there 's no drink or drug that can make multiple people have the exact same hallucination at the same time . No , it had to be something here . Something that the cops didn 't come into contact with , because all they saw was Joe . Well , uh , artifact intoxication ? Maybe it 's something in the water . Oh ! The condiments ! You know , I 've never trusted no Grey " Poop . " Give me good old-fashioned yellow . Well , whatever it was , we should find it before somebody else gets hurt . All right . Well , let 's just close this baby down . No diner , no danger . Gary ? Dr. Bauer 's ready for you now . Thank you . Oh , my God ! ( SNARLING ) ( SCREAMING ) What is it ? What 's happening ? It 's gonna kill us ! ( SNARLING ) Linda , run ! Help ! Help ! What are you doing ? ( SNARLING ) Get away from him ! ( SNARLING ) Ow ! You 're hurting me ! ( SCREAMING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( HORN HONKING ) PASSERBY : I 'm calling 911 now . Oh ! Miss , are you all right ? No . No , no , no , no ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Oh , God ! This can 't be happening to me ! Everything 's out of order now . I 'm due on 14 and if I 'm late , he 's gonna fire me ! He 's not gonna fire you . We 'll get you there on time , okay ? Gosh . Oh , thank you . I 'll sort it in the elevator . Okay . You got that ? Oh , God ! Thank you ! Got it all ? Oh , wait ! Sorry , I need to see your security badge . Oh , God . Yeah . Just ... No ... No , no , don 't cry . It 's okay . It 'll be our little secret . Thank you . Hi . How 's it going ? Pretty quiet . Why doesn 't that surprise me ? Uh , you new ? Yeah , I just started on Tuesday , actually . We must not have met yet . New kind of badge . Made it myself . Hey , cry baby , this isn 't 14 . Enough . All right , ow , with the pulling . Ow , ow ! You learn anything ? Well ... Whatever attacked them was big and green with enormous claws and glowing eyes . Anything helpful ? Nah . What about you ? No , I mean , and none of the patients had been in to see the dentist yet , so it wasn 't one of the instruments he used . None of them drank from the same water cooler or read the same magazine or even used the same pen . I mean , there 's no cross-contamination at all . Great . We have a fantastic list of what this isn 't . Think there 's a chance any of them ate at the diner ? No . I mean , aside from the end result , there 's no connection to the people at the diner . Look , the folks at the diner saw a big red scary thing . With tentacles . Please don 't . And , you know , the people here saw this green thing with the claws and the eyes and ... There is something about the tentacles . Will you please stop saying that word ? ( LAUGHING ) Man ! It 's like Indiana Jones with snakes . Yes , it is ! I don 't know what that means , but it is , okay ? I hate octopi or jellyfish or squid or anything that 's a form of Cnidarian , okay ? It 's a phobia , so just don 't . Okay . Okay . All right , fine . Let 's review . We don 't know what the artifact is , how it works or why it 's doing what it 's doing . We do know that it 's spreading . And this time someone died . Okay , I 'm gonna call Leena . You know , maybe she 'll scour the police scanners and find ... Find out if anyone 's reported more of these hallucinations . Ask her about the tentacles . I don 't care who knows I 'm here . I don 't care what it costs . I 'm bringing Steve back , Artie . And you are not gonna stop me . Don 't you think that I know how you feel ? I have lost partners . I 've lost friends , people that I would do anything to bring back . It 's not how things work . You don 't get to use artifacts for your own selfish needs . Ugh ! I 'm not being selfish ! This is not about me , it 's about Steve ! Is it ? Or is it because you just can 't bear losing him ? Claudia , is this what Steve would want ? For you to risk everything ? Artie , if you could use an artifact to set something right , to undo a huge , stupid tragedy , wouldn 't you do it ? I cared about Steve , too . I care about all of you . I know how tempting it is . But I 'm not gonna let you go down that road . Letting yourself be seduced by an artifact , Claudia , that 's just a path to destruction . And I 've seen it . You 've seen it ! With MacPherson , with H.G. , with Sykes . I 'm not them . They weren 't them either , until they became them . Ugh ! No ! No . She did not use the Metronome . And she won 't . I 'll see to it . ARTIE : There 's no need for a Regent to get involved . It 's all right , Artie . A decision has already been made . Claudia can bring back Agent Jinks . What ? No , no . No , no . No , they can 't . They can 't allow ... Artie . I said it 's all right . It 's not all right . You don 't understand . Something could be released . This is wrong . It 's wrong . Thank you . I know I 'm putting my career on the line . No , no . You 're putting your life on the line . Are you absolutely sure ? Yes . All right . Then there are certain arrangements to be made . Hey , Jimmy , I 'm home ! Can you come help me with these groceries ? Excuse me , ma 'am . I think you dropped your key . No , sorry , this isn 't mine . Oh . My mistake . Hey , honey , did you remember to get the kale for the ... ( SNARLING ) Oh ! ( SCREAMING ) I intercepted a 911 call where a man said something scary did something awful to his wife . That sounds like one for us . Uh , Leena , did the scary thing have ... Don 't . Tentative . Was it tentative ? I was asking if it seemed tentative . What did it do to her ? He didn 't know , but he locked it in a closet . And the 911 operator told him to sleep it off . Ah , artifact intoxication . East side of town . And it doesn 't seem like the police are in any rush to get over there . Well , that 's okay . We are . No ! Oh ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Easy , easy , okay ? We 're here to help ! It 's in there ! We 're Secret Service , all right ? We have a lot of experience dealing with this sort of thing . That 's right . That 's right . Look . See , we even brought the right equipment . What , are you like the Men in Black ? Yeah , yeah , we kind of are . Sure , why not ? Okay , listen to me . I just need you to move aside . Just come over here with me , okay , and just give me the gun . No ! What are you doing ? It 's going to kill us ! Hey ! Hey , hey ! ( GASPING IN FRIGHT ) ( SOBBING ) Will he , um ... Will he be the same ? He 's not gonna come back like some kind of zombie , right ? Steve will be Steve again . Claudia , what you 're about to do ... Is very dangerous . Yes , I know . You don 't have to hold my hand . I actually do . This is not unlike the bronze shoes . Without someone to walk this road with you , you may lose your way . Understand ? Now ... Leave one hand on the Metronome . ( METRONOME BEGINS TICKING ) Gently place the other on Steve 's heart . Close your eyes , Claudia . Concentrate on his face . His eyes . ( METRONOME CONTINUES TICKING ) But why isn 't it ... Shh . Wait . Thank you for contacting me . What kind of evil ? The evil that you mentioned from the astrolabe . What kind of evil , exactly ? I 've been told it 's an unimaginable evil , unique to the user . Nothing ... Nothing you could anticipate but ... An evil that will cut through his heart like a ... Dagger . Yes . Ugh ! Nothing 's happening . It 's not working . Patience , Claudia . Patience . ( SOFTLY ) Please . Please come back . ( WHIMPERING ) Please . ( GASPS LOUDLY ) Steve ! ( BOTH GASPING LOUDLY ) Put your hand back on the Metronome ! Claudia , look at me now ! Look at me ! You can 't help him if you die , too ! Claudia , look at me ! I 've done the research . I 've used every resource at my disposal . Nowhere . Nowhere does it describe this evil . Is it ... Is it possible that ... Could this evil be triggered by a resurrection ? By bringing somebody back to life ? Resurrection ? Why ? It is possible , isn 't it ? Anything is possible . Claudia , don 't look away . That 's it , that 's right . Try not to panic . Breathe . ( GASPING ) No ! No , I will not let this happen ! Claudia , talk to me . What do you see ? White . Everywhere . And Steve . ( SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( INAUDIBLE ) Don 't go to him ! He has to come to you . Stay focused on me and bring him with you . You wanted to save him , so save him , damn it ! Breathe ! ( GASPING ) CLAUDIA : ( MUFFLED ) Steve ! Steve ! ( GASPING ) JANE : That 's it , that 's it . Yes . ( BREATHING DEEPLY ) ( WHIMPERING ) Hey . ( CRYING ) Oh , my God . ( COUGHING SOFTLY ) What happened ? ( CHUCKLING ) There has to be something more that you can tell me , something specific . Knowing the evil won 't help you locate the astrolabe . I have to know everything , everything about the astrolabe in order to find it . For instance , was it used before ? Yes , but every circumstance is different . And the evil that was released ? By Robespierre , at the advent of the French Revolution . The Reign of Terror . Which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people . So , you see the possibilities . Yeah . Nothing ? There was nothing that could be done to stop it ? ( SIGHING ) As I 've explained , the only way to stop the evil from being created is to reverse the effect of the astrolabe . There has to be another way . It was huge , with wings and these glowing eyes . Yeah . He , uh , he started acting weird right after lunch . Must have been the mushrooms he had in his salad . That happens sometimes , especially with wild mushrooms . It 's the psilocybin . Thank God you got here in time . It was like he was having a nightmare , but he was wide awake . This happened as soon as you got home ? Right after I got inside . MYKA : Did you see anything else ? Anything unusual ? Nothing . Okay . Look , Robin , just walk me through this , okay ? Jimmy was home , you got home from the store , you got out of your car ... I grabbed the groceries from the trunk , and then I go inside . Oh , yeah . There was a man . He thought I dropped my key , but ... Wait , wait , wait . A man ? Um , ( STAMMERING ) A man thought what ? Well , he handed me a silver key but it wasn 't mine so I gave it back . A key ? A key . Myke , do you still have those sketches ? Yeah . Could you just excuse us for a second ? ( SIGHING ) You know , there must be some sort of time element to this artifact . I mean , her husband saw some terrifying something , and then we show up a few minutes later , we don 't see anything at all . And the same thing happened to the cops at the diner . PETE : Key , nightmare , tentacles . Tentacles ! Would you stop saying that word ? That 's it ! That 's it ! Cthulhu ! What ? That 's what I 've been trying to remember , Mykes . When I was a kid , I read these comic books ( STUTTERING ) About a sea creature named ... MYKA : Cthulhu . Created by H.P. Lovecraft . You know , I 've never read anything by him . What ? A writer you never read ? Well , when it comes to horror , I 'm more of a Kafka or a Shelley girl . But Cthulhu , I mean , the mythos does permeate a lot of popular culture . Well , you lost me there , but these things that they 've been seeing ... are definitely Lovecraft . Tentacles , claws and sometimes wings are all common to Lovecraft creatures . Apparently , he suffered a form of waking dream called night terrors . They came to him in his dreams . Nightmares . Right . And , yes , he blamed it on a silver key . He called it " the key to the gate of dreams . " A-ha , I smell artifact . Okay , uh , thanks , Leena . Okay , okay . So ... So , a man in a baseball cap gives Robin a silver key . Right ? Right , she walks into the house like the guy at the dental office . Or the kid in the diner . Oh , my God , Pete , we are looking at this thing all wrong . It 's not the people who are seeing Lovecraft 's creatures who 've been affected ! It 's the victims . The victims are the ones who get whammied . The artifact makes people see them as monsters . Okay . We need to go to talk to the first victim . We can 't . He 's in a coma . Okay , well , we 'll just ... We 'll go to his house then ( STAMMERING ) And try and find a connection . Let 's go . MYKA : I 'm not finding anything . PETE : Mykes . Look at this . It 's from the championship game . ( STAMMERING ) Didn 't Robin say that our key collector wore a hat from the championship game ? Yeah , so ? So they went to the same game . Philadelphia versus Cincinnati . Okay , so what was so important about that game ? I don 't know . After Cleveland lost , I quit watching . Which was early . Wait . Philly versus Cincinnati . I remember something about that game . You know about a sports event ? Something that could connect our victims ? MYKA : Not something . Someone . Theresa Hicks . She died at that game . I feel like I 've been hit by a truck . ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah , well ... Ugh , last thing I remember , Marcus was coming at me with a syringe . Oh ! ( CHUCKLING ) Guess I wasn 't much of a hero . Oh , no . You were a hero . You were amazing . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , yeah ? So how 'd I end up here ? Well , the injection Marcus gave you was pretty intense . You know , you were out of commission for a while . But , what you did saved us . Your intel led us right to Sykes . So he 's ... Finished . The Warehouse is safe . And Marcus ? Also finished . For good , this time . ( SIGHING ) I must have been out of it for a while to have missed all that . ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah . But you 're back now , Jinksy . Good as new . Uh , why aren 't we in my room ? ( EXHALING ) No reason . Just cleaner , easier . Closer to the front door , really . Claudia ? Yeah ? What aren 't you telling me ? ( LAUGHING ) Nothing . Oh , and now you 're lying ? ( LAUGHS ) Okay ! Heh , I guess we didn 't lose the whole human lie detector thing . God , I was kind of hoping . Lose ? Why would I lose ... ( METRONOME TICKING ) Steve , listen to me . I wasn 't lying to you , exactly . A lot of things happened ! GUARD : Here 's the security camera footage we have from that part of the stadium . The victim 's name was Theresa Hicks . I know . It 's a name I 'll never forget . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) PETE : Look ! That 's her , right there . MYKA : She was knocked out . Wait , stop . Stop ! ( STAMMERING ) That 's him . That 's the guy who was attacked at the dental office . He knocked her down , Mykes . Right . That 's ... That 's the accountant . Could you keep it running , please ? MYKA : He got in his way . Oh , my God , that 's ... That 's Joe ! The kid from the diner . Yes , it is . PETE : He wouldn 't help either . Uh , wait . Let me pull up a different angle here . Okay , this is a few seconds later . PETE : Wait , wait , wait . Wasn 't she just holding his hand a few seconds ago ? That newspaper article , it said that Theresa Hicks was engaged . Right , right . Uh ... Ron Hadsell . PETE : He 's trying to save her . Why won 't she help ? MYKA : That 's Robin . The housewife . He couldn 't save her . What ? He couldn 't save her . He ... He couldn 't save her , so he blames them . All those people , the man who pushed her down , the woman who wouldn 't stop to help , to Ron Hadsell , those people are monsters . He used Lovecraft 's key so that people would see them as real monsters . And suffer the same fate as his fiancee did . ( SIGHING ) Pete , look . The guy who 's blocking the ambulance . He 's got another monster on his list . Okay , I 'm gonna find Ron Hadsell . Okay ? You run those tags and find his next victim . Okay . I guess I should have told you . You think ? Dead . I was dead . You know , a lot of people experience clinical death for a few minutes . How many minutes was I dead for ? Four thousand , three hundred and twenty . ( EXHALES ) I 'm sorry , okay ? God , I 'm sorry any of it happened , but if you think I 'm going to apologize for bringing you back , I 'm not . You know , maybe it was completely selfish of me . Maybe I ruined your karma or put a kink in your plan to achieve enlightenment and come back as a butterfly or whatever Buddhists do . Maybe I 've upset the whole cosmos . I don 't care . I would do it all again . ( LAUGHS ) I really hope you can forgive me . But it 's okay if you don 't . You know , as long as you 're here . The world 's a better place with you in it , Jinksy . My world is anyway . It 's just ... It 's weird . Okay ? I don 't know what I feel or how I feel . Hell , I don 't even know if I feel . It 's gonna take some time . I get that . I totally get it . And , you know , if you decide you wanna be a butterfly , we can always stop the Metronome . ( LAUGHS ) Let 's not rush into anything . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mr. Hadsell ? Open up , it 's the Secret Service . Ron Hadsell ? Secret Service . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Mr. Green ? Mr. Jeff Green . You may be in danger . ( GASPING ) Ew ! ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Mykes . Pete , listen . I 'm at Hadsell 's house . He 's definitely our guy . Good work , partner . Huh ? We got him . Uh , well , not quite . ( STAMMERING ) He 's not here . HADSELL : Jeff . Jeff Green . That 's ' cause he 's here . Who are you ? Look , I 'm just someone who 's here to help . Son of a ... ( TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) Wait , wait ! Just un-whammy me , okay ? Look , we know what happened to Theresa . We can work this out , I promise . Oh , yeah ? Can you bring her back ? Then there 's nothing to work out . Sorry , it 's too late . Oh , my God . What the hell is that ? What are you talking about ? It 's gonna kill me ! Somebody ! This alien thing is gonna kill us all ! Wait . Cut it out , man . What are you talking about ? ( GROWLING ) Oh , my God ! Please help us ! Somebody help ! ( PHONE RINGING ) Come on , Pete , just pick up the phone . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( SCREAMING ) Mykes , you better get here quick . I 've been whammied ! ( ROARING ) ( STAMMERING ) Oh , my God . Pete ? Is that you ? Help ! Help , it 's gonna kill me ! Somebody , please help me ! Would you knock it off ? Oh , my God . ( ROARING ) Hang on , buddy ! Wait , hold on ! Hold on ! Okay ? This isn 't what it looks like . I 'm not ... ( ROARING ) Kill it ! Kill it before it kills us ! Never mind . ( ROARING ) ( ROARING ) Oh , my God , Pete . Is that you ? Of course it 's you . ( ROARING ) Oh . That 's a lot of tentacles . Lady , look out ! Get away from it ! Pete , just get behind me ! ( ROARING ) All right . Are you crazy ? ( ROARING ) Everybody just stay where you are , okay ? I 'm Secret Service ! Don 't make another move . Yeah ! You tell them , Mykes ! ( ROARING ) It 'll kill you ! Look out ! No , no ! I 'm not gonna hurt her . I like Myka . She 's my partner , see ? ( ROARING ) ( ZAPPING ) Okay , everybody just stay where you are . Okay ? This isn 't real . Whatever you think you 're seeing , it 's not gonna hurt you . I mean , he 's annoying and childish , and sometimes I wish I could throw a chair at him , but he 's not dangerous . Okay ? He 's my partner . Yeah , thanks , Mykes . ( ROARING ) What you 're seeing is a hallucination . It 's caused by mushrooms . I didn 't eat mushrooms ! In the water supply ! Okay ? So , everybody just relax . No . No , she was right . We 've gotta kill it before it kills us . Oh , my God , it 's him . Pete , here , just ... ( ROARING ) MYKA : Okay , Hadsell . Give me the key . She 's afraid of it . It 's got her ray gun ! Don 't make me shoot you . Argh ! ( GRUNTING ) Argh ! Watch it ! Those things are expensive . ( ROARING ) Argh , hey ! You could 've put an eye out , mister ! ( ROARING ) We 've got it scared now ! ( GRUNTING ) Stay down ! ( GROANING ) ( FIZZLING ) Jerry , wait ! Stop ! ( PANTING ) ( STAMMERING ) You 're just a guy . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , yeah ? Well , you 're overworking your lats . You see what happens ? I tried going to the police . They wouldn 't listen . They said it was an accident . It wasn 't . It was a crime . Fear and selfishness . People should be prosecuted for that . So why go through with all this ? I mean , why not just shoot them ? I tried once . I couldn 't do it . ( STAMMERING ) And you just stumbled upon the key ? I heard about it years ago at a horror con . When the cops wouldn 't help , I hunted it down . I knew that if it somehow worked , it would be the perfect weapon . And it was . It showed those people for who they really were . Let 's go . Wish I could feel sorry for him , Mykes , but ... ( INHALING DEEPLY ) I can 't . One guy in a coma , another guy dead ? He 's no better than they are . I know that in my head , but I also understand how that combination of grief and anger can drive you to do things that you know you shouldn 't do . All right , Artie , Steve 's at the BB , waiting for Pete and Myka , so , I 'm ... Apparently in a bit of trouble . Wait . No , I 'm sorry . I got permission . So it would seem . Adwin , what 's going on here ? Jane , I believe you know exactly what 's going on . You didn 't get approval , did you ? You rebel . ADWIN : Agent Donovan , using an artifact of this magnitude is almost unconscionable . No , leaving Steve dead after he saved the Warehouse , saved all of us , that would be unconscionable . Jane ... That would have been wrong . Jane ... You cannot be ruled by your guilt . Whether any of this is right or wrong is now irrelevant , isn 't it ? Neither one of you understand the ramifications of your actions , nor does Agent Jinks . There are consequences . ADWIN : Agent Jinks may be alive , but he 's not a free man . He 's linked to the Metronome , and therefore , to the Warehouse and the Regents forever . And because we do not yet know the downside of this artifact , the Metronome will stay with us . And Agent Jinks will be under supervision . Lifetime supervision . Okay , that doesn 't sound so bad ... And if there is a dangerous downside , the Regents will take action . Sounding worse . What if we were to discover that the downside of the artifact is that anyone Agent Jinks has ever touched is now slowly dying ? Bear in mind , should things go awry , we will not hesitate . You would have to ... Our first responsibility , all of us , is to protect the world from the dangers of an artifact . Dead guys eat , right ? Oh , that 's so stupid ! What ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) I imagine Mr. Kosan ... Mmm-hmm , and are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . ( LAUGHS ) Are we okay ? Yeah . Um ... We 're okay . ( BEEPING ) CLAUDIA : I 'm so tired from bringing a man back from the dead . ( BEEPING ) BROTHER ADRIAN : An evil that will cut through your heart like a dagger . Artie ? Hey , what are you , dead ? You did hear the word " dinner , " didn 't you ? ( LAUGHS ) Artie . What ? What ? What is it ? ( STAMMERING ) Oh , nothing . Nothing at all . No . What is it ? Artie ? So , what 've we , uh ... What 've we got ? What 's good there ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES )

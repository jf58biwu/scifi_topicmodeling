 Zindy , my darling , I can 't believe we 're finally going to meet in person . It won 't be long , Johnny cakes . My space bus gets in at 4 : 30 . Just in time for the all-you-can-stand buffet at Chizzler . See you soon . Ew ! Zoidberg , what is that ? That is the delightful creature I 've been video dating for the past four years . Hit it with a stick ! Tonight is a dream come true , a real , live date in a physical place that exists . I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place . There . My home 's all clean except for one part , the inside . Aww . I 'm sure it 's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster . Nope . Step aside , people . I got bug bombs . Bender , wait . Won 't the bugsjust run out and infest someplace else ? Like , our building ? Not my problem . Fire in the hole ! Amazing . You move like a young , roach-infested Gene Kelly . Oh , my God . It 's Randy ! Damn right ! And I 'm organizing a tap-dance contest for the Parks and Rec Department . If you don 't enter , I 'll just kill myself , okay ? Okay . No . Wait . Me ? Lil ' ol ' Bender ? In a dance contest ? It 's a way for the community to ... At last , a chance to realize my brand-new dream of being the greatest tap dancer in all the world . Well , in a three-block radius . Of all time ! Greetings , merchant ! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things . The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies for $ 6 . Perfect ! I 'll take half a bouquet of daisies for $ 3 . These flower shears are so dull , and I 'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town . Allow me . Oh ! Thank you ! That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady . I 'm gonna snip her off her feet ! Zindy ! You 're even more beautiful from a distance ! Johnny cakes ! Good God ! What 's that horrible stench ? Stench ... Uh " . It 's probably this stinky bus station maybe . Come . Let 's go someplace well ventilated and grow old together . Ah ... Much better . It 's even worse ! It 's like Comic-Con in a submarine ! Oh , my God ! The smell 's coming from you ! What ? That ? That 's just my personal musk . You 'll learn to love it . I know I did . I 'm sorry , Zoidberg . I can 't see you anymore . Somethings come up . It 's vomit ! I 'd like to return these for a refund . - Don 't worry . - They 're unused . Oh , I 'm sorry . I get so little business I can 't afford refunds . I don 't know what 's wrong with this location . I understand . Please don 't cry . I can 't stand to see a living thing feel pain . You are a living thing . Right ? Uh-huh . Can I have a refund now ? Ah ! This here 's a bayonet . It 's some kind of kooky half gun , half knife . Now empty out the register ! And no bag , please . I care about the environment . I have $ 3 in moldy pennies . It 's all yours . That 's generous of you . Oh , no , you don 't , Mr. Big Jerk ! I have nothing to live for , so I don 't mind telling you , those pennies are mine . Don 't you get it ? I 'm crazy ! Go ahead ! I don 't care what happens anymore . Do it . Bash my head in . Wha ... What is that ? Mustard gas ? That ain 't legal . Ain 't you heard of no Geneva Convention ? That was amazing . Oh , you were so brave and frugal . I 'm sorry . Don 't hit me . Ooh ! I like the way you hit ! But I don 't get it . Most women I 've met can 't even stand next to me without collapsing . What 's wrong with those women ? Well , some of them didn 't have legs . But it 's not them . It 's me . How do I put this delicately ? I 'm smellier than a whorehouse 's outhouse ! That 's terribly vivid . Doesn 't matter to me though , I was born with no sense of smell . Really ? My name 's Marianne . Hello , you ! I like your dumpster . Thank you . The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon . I remember . Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller . Can I kiss you ? First , let me pinch myself to make sure I 'm not dreaming ! Ouch ! I forgot I was a giant crab ! Welcome , fans ! I 'm Randy , coordinator of this Tap-Dance-A-Palooza . Whoo-hoo ! Randy ! After weeks of searching , I 'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate . Tonya , Bender , Greg , some kind of blob monster , and Petunia ! The extra clicking you 'll hear is gonna be my hip . FYI , this little lady has a heart condition . She 's always stealing them ! Also , she has a serious heart condition . I 'm six years old , and tap dancing is my favoritest thing , even if it 's not good for my pacemaker . Aww ! That is one quality pacemaker . The rest of you might as well give up now , 'cause I 'm gonna take home the ... Hey , what 's my grand prize gonna be ? Oh , there is no prize , Dorothy , unless you count the satisfaction of winning . It will be mine ! In conclusion , bullying in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . Out of my way , fatty ! I 'm practicing . Whoa ! Ow ! Ta-da ! Friends ' I 'd like you to meet my new lady . Marianne . Whoa ! Hey ! What 's the catch ? She looks normal . She 's not a hologram . Not a robs-slave . We give up . You guys are weird . I have to go open my flower stand before the falafel guy takes my spot , but it was great to meet you . See you later , crab cakes . Dr. Zoidberg , she 's great . She 's the best thing that ever happened to me . We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster . Ew ! I hope she used protection . No offense , Zoidberg , but how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench ? Because , my friends , she has no sense of smell . That explains it . I get it . For the first time in my life , I 'm truly happy . It 's just too bad for her there 's no cure , I assume . Oh , but there is ! A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant . Ah ! You 're right ! And I , as a renowned ear , nose , and blowhole doctor , could do the operation ! Are you nuts ? if she could smell , she 'd smell you ! Your relationship would be over faster than you can say ... Listen to Orange Joe . You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery . Oh , I don 't know . It doesn 't seem fair to Marianne . But on the other claw , maybe I can 't live without her . So , you 're right . I can never tell her . You 're doing the right thing . Today , the competition begins . Over the course of the summer , we 'll be eliminating one contestant each week , and by " we " I mean . . me " Deal with it , you babies ! Let the battle begin ! Okay . Before those Pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in and take the room , here are the finalists for next week 's championship . Bender and Tonya ! I just wanna have fun because dancing is fun , and I like dancing . Aww ! I 'm gonna kick your ass , little girl . For you , my lovely rugelach . Thank you . It 's Gardenia imperialis . You can brew it into a tea if you like severe stomach cramps . Such a smart one ! You know everything about flowers . Everything but how they smell . Please . Describe it to me . Uh ... It 's like summer , with a dab of vanilla and honey , or maybe winter with some gravy on it . I 'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that . Marianne , my love , I 've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly , and there 's a way maybe you can . Really ? How ? We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant . I can give you a surgery . And when it 's done , you 'll be able to smell everything . Oh , Zoidberg ! I want the biggest nose you can find ! Dude , you made the finals . Congrats ! You 've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to . Yeah , but I 'm not done yet . I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ ! You 're gonna put sequins on your hat ? See that locker ? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there . So right before she dances , I 'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them . The harder she dances , the more she bleeds . Seems like a solid plan . What ? It 's the most horrifying thing I 've ever heard ! That 's true . Well , it gets worse . Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss , I kidnap her parents and make them watch while I cut off her hair with these hedge clippers . Don 't you lay a hand on that angel ! Angel ? I 've looked into her eyes and seen her soul ! She 's a monster . You 're insane . Come on , Fry . Let 's go . Okay . See ya , Bender . The championships mine , robot . Why ? What did I not do yet to deserve this ? Aww . I think it 's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose . Yeah . She 'll be forever grateful from somewhere upwind . True . Our relationship will end once she smells my odor . But you know what would really stink ? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers . Dr. Zoidberg , help ! Bender ? What happened to your leg tube ? I got beat up by a little girl . Please . Fix my knee , so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship ! I don 't have time for this , robot . Here , patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack . time ! I got a donor nose ! There was an accident at the fencing academy . Touch√© . It 'll all be over soon , my love . May I have one last kiss ? Oh , there 'll be lots more . Yes . Lots . Nurse Amy , the anesthesia . Smell you later . She 's out . Then let 's begin this delicate procedure . Okay , dance maniacs . Let 's have a big hand for our finalists , cute , little Tonya and mean , old whafs-his-name . Break a leg , Bender . Oops ! Looks like you already did . You are an evil , heartless troll , so , actually , we have a lot in common . In another life , we could 've been friends . No chance , garbage-can face . Brace yourselves , 'cause we 're gonna try something you would never see in mainstream tap , a simultaneous , head-to-head tap-off . What ... Oh ! Scandalous ! It 's time for some fancy-shmancy dancy . Hit it , me ! Ow ! Ow ! Bender . Oh , look at him dance ! He don 't care . Try this , peg-leg - No sweat ! Time 's up , kittens . The judge has conferred and the vote is in . I pick her . Thanks , Mr. Nice Man . You know , the doctors say my heart doesn 't work very good , but it feels good today , 'cause I got to dance and make people happy . I never knew I could hate this much ! Bender ! She 's a sweet little girl . She 's a pic ! I 'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day ! Oh ! This is the best-estest day of my whole ... Oh , my God , people ! She 's having a heart attack ! A cute little heart attack ! I 'm a doctor and , yes , they 're real . Clear ! How ... How did it go ? Just perfect . This time , you can describe their beautiful aroma to me . on ! What is that horrible stench ? I don 't know how to tell you this , but ... It 's these flowers ! Ew ! It 's not the flowers . It 's ... Ah ! Much better . You smell just like I dreamed you would . But most people think I smell like a burning zoo ! I never learned a good smell from a bad smell , but I like the way you smell , because I like you . Mmm ... It 's so beautiful ! I 'm sorry . She 's gone . Whoo-hoo ! In your dead face , little girl ! I 'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave . I 'm gonna dance on your corpse right now . oh , my God ! No , Bender . What 're you doing ? No ! Bender , stop ! The robot has to go ! Huh ? What 's that ? I took a nappie ! I don 't believe it . She 's alive ! Bender 's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart . He 's a big ol ' hero ! Hooray ! I didn 't ... No , I was trying ... Hey . Wait . Come on . What ... Just ' cause you saved my life doesn 't mean I won 't beat you down again . Man ' you are irredeemably evil . Together , we shall rule the galaxy ! Aww , what an adorable , little kajigger . Now ! Ah ... Nothing like the first cup ofd umpster juice in the morning . Marianne ? Yes . Listen , I 've got a new job , and , well , I 'm going to have to dump you . I 'd like that !

 And what do you call this ? Uh , well , that 's a tiny , little dent , sir . - A dent ? Yes . - Yeah . Consequently , I will not be accepting this package . Thank you . Sir , the delivery company can 't be held responsible for something that 's obviously a pre-shipping damage . Pre-shipping damage ? What do you do to these boxes , eh ? You drop them ? Do you ? Do you get together and kick them ? Is that it ? Do you get together with yourfriends , " Oh , it 's a box . Let 's kick it ! " Let 's kick again and again and again . " Shall we kick the box ? It 's only Mr. Hudson 's box . Let 's just stamp it until it 's crushed ! " Is that it ? As I say , I will not accept this package . Pff ! Hey ! Hey ! Get away from my car ! Get away from my car ! Get away ! I know where you live ! Oh , I hate that dog . Max ! Oh , Max , I missed you ! Hey , Ashley . Hi . What kind of dog is that ? Only the smartest dog in the world . Yes , you are . Yeah , whatever . He doesn 't look very smart to me . Okay , boy , you want to show everybody how smart you are ? Okay , shake . What 's that ? You 're tired ? Okay . Sorry , girls . No shows today . Come on . You didn 't have to leave me hanging back there , you know ? Is it just so hard to shake hands ? Are you mad at me ? Good to know . We can work on the handshake thing later , though , okay ? Come on . Hey ! Ashley ! Go , boy ! Go ! Go ! Just you wait there , young lady . Hi , Mr. Hudson . Did you see that strange dog running by here ? No . I saw your dog running by here with you , without a leash again . That 's crazy , Mr. Hudson . I 've never seen that dog before in my life . My dog is locked safe in my backyard . Come on , Ashley . Yourfilthy mutt was whizzing on my radials not half an hour ago . Hmm . I bet it was the dog . Well , of course , it was the bloody dog ! I just said that , didn 't I ? Oh , you mean that strange dog that looks like my dog that just ran by here ? That dog and your dog are one and the same dog . I want it on a leash ! My dog is locked in my backyard , as we speak . Come on , I 'll show you now . See ? Secured and locked . Well , let 's just see how secured and locked it is , shall we ? Okay . See ? You have to unlatch it to open it . After you . Just as I thought . No dog . That 's because he 's out whizzing on my valuables . He 's just taking a nap . Max , come here , boy ! You see ? I know your dog is getting out , and next time , I 'm going to call the pound . You got that , sweetheart ? Sure . Oh , hi . Oh , Ashley , I 'm so glad I caught you here . Hi , Ms. Knight . Charlie . Oh , I 've got something to show you . Okay , um , well , I am organizing the Neighborhood Alert campaign . Ooh . I 'm in charge of keeping the neighborhood safe , so if you see any suspicious things , you get a hold of me immediately . - Okay . - 24 / 7 . I never sleep . Look . I got my whistle . And I 'm loud , too . All right . It 's exciting , isn 't it ? - Yeah . - All right . Well , I got to get around the neighborhood to tack all of those to the doors . All right . Let 's go , Charlie . Good luck , Ms. Knight . I 'll be sure to show this to my dad . Oh , thank you , sweetheart . Say hi to him for me . All right , Charlie , let 's go . Oh , Mr. Hudson ! Mr. Hudson , slow down ! That was a close one , boy . Not now , boy . Hey , guys , I 'm home ! Dad 's home . Come on . Let 's go ! Hey , Max . What do you want , poopsicle ? - Dad 's home . - And ? And your room is disgusting . Get out of here ! Sisters . - Dad ! - Hey , sweetie ! Good to see you . You brought pizza ? Yeah . How long this time ? It 's just 48 hours . Lieutenant called in sick , and they need me to run the station for a couple of days ... and then right back to a regular schedule . Course , Ms. Knight will be watching you guys . We really need this . You know , filling in forthe lieutenant is good for my promotion , so I need your help on this . I cleaned the kitchen . I couldn 't do this without you . No way . Pizza , huh ? 'Fraid so . That 's just great . No , it 's fine . I didn 't have any plans this weekend anyway . - Zack . - You know , my friends all wanted to hang out this weekend , Dad , but , hey , I 'd much rather be stuck in this house making sure my little sister doesn 't accidentally kill herself . That 's enough , Zack . - You got that right . Okay . All right , listen up , guys . This isn 't anybody 's idea of a really fun weekend , but this is the weekend we got . Okay ? And I 'm sorry about yourfriends , but let 's face it , guys , this is more important . We 're family . What 's left of one . Look , I 'm sorry , Dad , but can my friends at least come over here ? Yeah , that should be fine . Just don 't burn the house down , okay ? Uh , yes . Yes , sir . Totally . Got it . Scout 's honor . Ashley , if you want to have a friend ortwo over , you can , too . Or , Dad , maybe she could spend the night at their house . No , that 's okay . I 've got lots to do around the house . Laundry is backing up . Ashley , don 't feed Max any pizza . You know what that does to his system . It 's okay , Dad . Did ... Did he just ... Ew ! Ew ! That dog stinks ! Sorry , guys . Max , wait ! It 's okay , Max . I still love you . Okay , Fluff . It 's time . Okay . Okay . Hey , Fluffy . You ready ? Come on . It 's okay . It 's okay . I would never do anything to hurt you . I 'm going to count to three , and then I 'm going to pull the trigger . Oh , look . I 'm done . See ? Totally tricked you . You fall forthat every time . You do . Every time . Didn 't even hurt , did it ? Did it ? See if that puts a hop in your step . Ha ! That 's a rabbit joke . Okay . Fluffy ? Fluffy , what is it ? Are you okay ? Okay , Fluffy ! Fluffy , let go of my tie ! Aah ! Fluffy . Are you hungry ? Okay , all right . Uh , all right . Okay . Here . Here . Here . Here we go . You want a carrot ? Whoa ! It 's okay . Wow . You weigh a ton . Here you go . Just eat it . Whoa , that ... Wow . That was impressive . I know . I know . You 're welcome . You 're welcome . Mmm , oh ! Okay , here we go . Let 's just give you a little something to wash that down with , huh ? No , it 's okay . It 's okay . This is the blue one . The blue 's good . Here we go . Here we go . It 's okay . There . Does that feel a little better ? Huh ? It 's all right . It 's okay . Here we go . Come with me . It 's okay . Wow . That was really disturbing . It was my fault . I apologize . Turn this off , huh ? And , um , you were very brave . I 'm very impressed . Where did ... Where did we go wrong ? Right there ? You think ? Yeah , you 're right . Wow . Well , you could 've told me that . Well , don 't ... don 't talk back to me . That was rude . Get back in . Okay . Who else knows about this ? Security tech , a few guards . Fire them . Consider it done . Now , that ... That is what I call progress . Oh , so remember , I need your laundry by tomorrow , so I 'll have time to fold it on Sunday . If you wouldn 't mind , could you at least sort it for me ? You know , you 're not Mom , Ash . I 'm not trying to be . And you 're not impressing anyone with this Little Miss Maid thing you 've got going on . In fact , I 'm a little sick of it , and your dumb dog . He 's not dumb . Oh , yeah ? Smartest dog in the world ? He can 't even shake hands . Ashley , come on . Wait ! Research . This is Victor . Dr. Victor , it 's your boss , Sirus Caldwell . Oh , actually , it 's Dr. Lloyd . Victor 's my first name . Your name is ... Okay . Now , I 'm calling you in regards to the chemical compound you stumbled across the other day . The one with the bunny ? Uh , bunny , sir ? The bunny you turned into a monster . That bunny . See , what I 'm going to do is sell your little experiment to the highest military bidder . I can see it now . Awhole army of , I don 't know , attack ... Bunnies ? No , not bunnies . I want something bigger . Well , um , you know , that would take a lot of paperwork . You know , filings , licensing , uh , permits . It could take months if not years . Don 't you worry your pretty little bald head about it . In fact , I have a team picking up a new test subject as we speak . - Oh . Uh , Mr. Caldwell , I don 't think ... - Goodbye , Dr. Victor . Yes , Natalya ? Ourteam is out , ready to intercept new test subject . Looking for anything particular ? Something ... bigger , but not too big . I want something impressive . Yes , Mr. Caldwell . Consider it done . Max ! Max ! Max ? - Dad , it 's Max ! - Whoa , what 's wrong ? - It 's Max ! He 's gone ! - What happened ? He didn 't come to school . He didn 't come and visit me . He 's gone . Okay . It 's okay . Hey , we 'll grab Zack , we 'lljump in the truck , and we 'll go find him , okay ? - Okay . - Okay . We 'll find him . Hey , Zack , come on out , buddy ! - Let 's go get him . - Okay Max ! Where are you ? Max ! Come , boy ! Max ? Max ? Max ! Max , come home , boy ! What 's this ? Pizza . - You want some ? - No , thank you . Oh , come on . It 's Italian sausage . It 's really good . You 'll like it . - No , I 'm good . Really , I 'm fine . - All right . More for me then . Hey . Let 's talk about this stuff . The glowy green stuff ? Let 's do that thing , you know ? That thing where you turn a bunny into a monster , but this time , let 's do it with a dog . You know , man 's best friend ? Wouldn 't that be cool ? You 're crazy . I am not crazy ! I 'm motivated . Look , Mr. Caldwell , you can 't just inject a dog . No , I can 't . I won 't . I wouldn 't . You will . With all due respect ... that 's criminal . Criminal . Yeah , criminal ? Yes , maybe , from a legal , ethical , moral viewpoint . Uh , maybe , but the way I see it , I have a chemical compound that turns critters into monsters . You know , Doc , I 'm just concerned with yourwelfare . Me , sir ? Well , I mean , what 's going to happen when the footage from the security cameras of you turning an innocent little bunny into a monster gets leaked to the press ? The whole world 's going to hate you , and , of course , I 'll have to fire you , because I can 't be seen harboring an evil mad scientist . - That 's a lie . - No . That is business . You do it . Sorry , buddy . Nothing 's happening . Nothing 's happening . It 's not enough . It needs another shot . Please , Mr. Caldwell , we can stop this before it 's too late . Dr. Victor , don 't stand in the way of progress . Oh ... Oh , yeah . Oh , yes . Huh ? Aah ! Aah ! - The serum ! - Why aren 't you helping ? Uh , I can 't stand in the way of progress , Mr. Caldwell . Knock it off ! - Aah ! - Oh ! Aw , I needed that stuff . Come here . Ugh ! Uhh ! God , my mouth was open . - Enough . - No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! Ha-ha-ha-ha ! Ow-whee ! Ohh ... He bit your butt . Hey , what you working on ? Rememberthat time I lost Molly ? Molly . Your doll ? Yeah ? I looked everywhere , and I couldn 't find her , but all I remember was Mom suggesting to make some " lost doll " posters . So she sat down with me . We made a bunch of them . Then she helped me hang them all up and down the street on trees and telephone poles . Ashley . Wow . This is amazing . Mmm . I never did find Molly , but just making those posters with Mom really helped , you know ? Like I was doing something about it . Mom would be so proud of you , just like I am . You really miss her , don 't you ? Yeah , I do . We don 't talk about her as much anymore , do we ? It 's been four years . Three and a half . You know , Mom wouldn 't want to see you alone forever . Well , I 'm not alone . I got you two turkeys . That 's not what I mean . I know what you mean . I 'm just saying ... if you everwanted to go on a date ... Zack and I would be okay with it . Ashley , honey , where 's all this coming from ? I know it 's nice to have someone who loves you , not because you 're family , because you 're special . Well , you are very special to me . Thank you . On that note ... Zack ? Can you come in here , buddy ? Okay , I 'm taking off to the station . Now , if you need anything at all , Helen is right next door . You go to her or you give me a call . - No problem , Dad . - Okay . - Promise ? - Yeah , yeah . It 's all good . All right . I will take these to the guys down at the station . Have them put them up . Love you , Daddy . Love you , too . Make me proud , boy . Hey there , poopsicle . How you holding up ? We have got work to do . Okay , fine . But afterthis , we 're even . Okay . You head down toward the elementary school . I 'll make my way toward the high school . Okay . Zack ? Zack , it 's like midnight . Good night , Zack . Good night , Max . I love you . This is so good . I 'm starving . How long were we out there ? I don 't know . Three , four hours . I 'm going back out after lunch . Come on , Ash . It 's my first day of total freedom , and I ... What was that ? It was probably nothing . Yeah , you 're right . Call Dad ? No . Come on . - Well ? - Well , what ? Well , aren 't you going to go out there to look ? Why me ? You 're the older brother . You opened the door . Be my guest . Go , go , go , go , go ! - Where is it ? - I don 't know . Aah ! Go ! Go ! Go , go , go ! - Aah ! - Go ! What is it ? Aah ! Aah ! What is he ? Zack , shut up ! You 're just going to agitate it . - Oh , snap ! - Aah ! Aah ! What 's he want ? I don 't know . Wait . Max ? Max . Oh , boy , I missed you so much . No way . Max ? Is that really you , boy ? Whoa ! Oh , that dog stinks ! Did you get stung by a bunch of bees or something ? No , I bet it was toxic waste . It 's always toxic waste . No , it 's something else . Like what ? Like ... I don 't know . But I do know one thing . - Max is back . - Yeah . Whoa ! Well , at least he 'll be easy to find , right ? Yeah . Better hide him . Yeah . Dr. Victor . Uh , Mr. Caldwell , I , uh ... I really need to go to the restroom . You think I could ... Uh ... I have an ultimatum for you , Dr. Victor . Dr. Lloyd . Uh , an ultimatum , sir ? You allowed our prize test subject to escape . Because of you , there is no breakthrough product to go to market . Everything was destroyed in that beast 's rampage , a rampage initiated by a lack of oversight . Ergo , the responsibility is yours . Excuse me , Mr. Caldwell , but it really wasn 't my fault . - Wait . There 's more . - Oh , great . That mutt destroyed all our computer records , the serum , and the antidote , so ... - Mm-hmm . - Here 's what you 're going to do . You ... Are going to get that dog , bring it back here , re-create the serum and the antidote ... Antidote . ... by gene splicing his bloodwork , and then I 'm going to have the dog destroyed ... by you . Why ? What did the dog do ? It bit my butt ! And no one bites Sirus Caldwell 's butt . Why would we have to splice the DNA of an innocent creature just to replicate the ... Just bring me the dog ! You can start at the address where we found it . My security team is at your disposal . Oh , that won 't be necessary . Go . Too late . Sorry . Well , that 's new . I should probably get that looked at . Ahh-ha . Wow . Uh , hey , kid . Um , do you happen to know where the people live who put this flyer up ? Maybe . Why ? Well , I may know what happened to their dog . What do you say , can you help me out ? - Sure . - Hey , thanks , kid , I appreciate it . Ten bucks . I 'm sorry ? You heard me . Ten bucks . Aw , come on , kid , it 's just a lost dog . You don 't care . Okay . Heh . You take credit cards ? All right , they 're all canceled anyway . Look , all I have is a twenty , so I 'm just ... That 'll work . Okay , go around the corner , down to Maple , make a right . It 's the second-to-last house on the left-hand side at the end of the street . Thanks , Rockefeller . Good luck with that twenty . Don 't spend it all in one place . Cute kid . Aw , come on ! Sorry , kid ... sort of . Max , stop it ! Oh , you got to be kidding me . Hey , guys , Max is missing . Keep an eye out , will you ? Thanks . It 's Dad ! Max , let go ! Hi , Daddy ! Hey , honey , how 's everything ? Ashley , help me ! Yeah , everything 's fine , normal , peachy . Max show up yet ? - Aah ! - Grab him ! Ashley , what 's going on ? Uh , Mr. Hudson 's cat got into our backyard , so we 're just trying to catch it . Mr. Hudson has a cat ? Uh , yeah , Dad , I totally thought that you knew that . And we 're just trying to catch him , because , you know , I 'm totally allergic to cats . Ah-choo ! Ah-choo ! Right . Ashley , I need you now ! I 'm coming ! Get that cat out and be careful . I handed out flyers at the station , so all eyes are out on Max . Uh , yes , okay , Dad . I love you ! Thanks ! Bye ! Love you ... too . I 'm coming ! Come on , boy . Come on . I 've got yourfavorite treats . Would you like them ? It tastes good . I 'd pourthat food quick if I were you . You 'd better leave the bag . Good night , Max . So now what ? Now we figure out how to get him back to normal . And how exactly do we do that ? Jeez , I don 't know , Zack . I figure we just call up Dr. Frankenstein and set up an appointment . Are you serious ? You got any better ideas ? Ashley , Ashley , Ashley . Hmm ? Neighborhood Alert . This is Helen . Mm-hmm , okay . My God . What-what area are you in ? Yes , yes , all right ! I 'm on it ! I 'll be right there ! Neighborhood Alert . This is Helen . Yes . No , I 'm on it .

Max ? Come here , boy ! Max ? Hey , boy , we 've got to get you inside , okay ? Okay , go inside . I got a treat ! Help ! Ash ! Ash , guess what ? Dad 's out there , and he 's with the fire crew .

There is a beast . A giant , size of a car , licked my face . Licked me right across the face . You wouldn 't believe it . Sir , uh , have you been drinking tonight ? Have I been drink ... Of course , I haven 't been drinking , you idiot ! Do I look like I 've been drinking ? Would I be lying here if I 'd been drinking , eh ? Who do you think you are , prancing along up here with your ... with your ... with your uniform and your badge and your gun , asking good members of the community if they 've been drinking ? No , I have not been bloody drinking ! I just wanted to let you know what 's going on here . I am in charge of the Neighborhood Alert . In fact , I 'm the one who called you and wanted to make sure that you got here immediately , because there 's something crazy going on , and I don 't know what it is . And I used to want to be a police officer , but , my God , I 'm a single parent ! How could I possibly do that , right ? - What 's up , guys ? - Hey , Dad ! Hi , Dad ! - Uh , nothing , nothing . - Nothing . Nothing much , uh , but things are getting really crazy out here . Yeah . Did you hear Mr. Hudson was attacked by this huge fur ... fur ... He wasn 't actually attacked . He just saw something that scared him . Right ? Yeah , uh-huh . So , uh , Dad , is Mr. Hudson going to be okay ? Yeah , he 's going to be fine . How do you know about Mr. Hudson ? Well , um ... Ms. Knight told us when she checked in on us . Didn 't she ? Yeah , yeah . She did . She most certainly did . Oh . Well , I think you guys should come with me and stay in the station tonight . No ! No ! We can 't do that , 'cause in there ... - It 's , uh ... - I and she ... and I in the house . - Yeah . - Yeah , uh-huh . Okay , just stay inside , okay ? And lock up . Call me if there 's anything suspicious . I 'm sure it 's nothing , but just to be safe , lock it up . - Okay . - See you , Dad . Uh , love you ! Bye ! Yeah , I love you . This is going to be a long night . Hey , Mark , what do you think ? I think this guy 's a goof . You think you can have one of your guys stick around for us tonight just in case ? - Okay , you got it . - Thanks . Okay . Ahh ! Oh ! Mmm ! Uh , you ... Ooh . Can I help you ? Good morning , ma 'am . - Morning . I represent Out Of This World Vacuums . - Perhaps you 've heard of us . - No , I haven 't . - Ohh ! - Aah ! Neverfear . Allow me to demonstrate .

Oh , you know , I 'm working in it ! I don 't want you working on it ! I want you finishing it ! Now ! I want that dog here , now , or something bad is going to happen to you . Or maybe something bad is going to happen ... to Fluffy . You wouldn 't . Ooh ! I would . Aaaahh ! Ow ! What are you doing here ? Uh , I 'm the pool guy ? I don 't think so . No . Ha ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

I mean , this dog is , like , really hungry . - Ugh ! - Let 's go . They got the super-size pooper scoopers back there . You 're going to need it . Okay . Here we go . Aah ! This thing is heavy ! Well , don 't make me do all the work . Help ! Pull ! Come on , pull . Hurry up ! Can 't you see he 's hungry ? When isn 't he hungry ? Whoa ! We ... are in so much trouble . No , Zack , not if we can figure out a way to undo whatever it is Max got himself into . Well , that sounds great . Do you have a magic wand or something ? No . But maybe I found someone who does . We need to move on this . Way ahead of you ... as usual . How are we supposed to get that to the vet 's office without someone noticing ? Slow , down , Ash . His tail keeps whacking me in the face . You 're starting to sound like a crybaby . Hello ? Mr. Caldwell ? Mr. Caldwell ? Where 's the dog ? Uh , I couldn 't find him . Really ? Yes , sir . Uh , listen , the reason I 'm here is to tell you that I quit . What you 're doing here is wrong , and I ... I don 't want to be a part of it . Not a part of it ? Buddy ... you created it . And now it , and you , are going to make me ... rich ! Well ... " er " ! Oh , and , uh , thanks forfinding the dog . I didn 't find the dog . Be-bah be-bah , no lies , no lies . My security was following you all day . They 're actually moving in right now to collect my little prize . Oh , and , Dr. Victor ... you can 't quit ... because you 're fired . Bye-bye . It 's okay , Max . It 's going to be all right . - Hi , kids . - Hi . I 'm Dr. Tawni Martinez . What you got there ? Uh , maybe you should let me do that . Dos mo ! This is my dog , Max . I 'm Ashley . This is my brother , Zack . - Hi . - Hi . It 's like an undiscovered species . No , he 's just a mutt . Honest . Ay-yi-yi . TAWNl : His breath . So this is your dog . But he didn 't always look like this . Something happened to him . Can you help us ? He was such a cute dog . I mean , you are a cute dog . Sorry , Max . Well , uh ... I will need to keep him here , of course , while I run a few tests and examine him . Oh , ho . Don 't worry . Nothing serious , m pequerio monstruo . I promise I 'll do everything I can to help . Anything to get my old dog back . Okay . - Well , let 's bring him in . - Okay . Come on . Come on , Max . It 's okay , babies . This is Señor Max , and we are all going to make him feel welcome aren 't we , hmm ? This is my dog , Lady . Guess what , Lady ? We have a guest . Hmm , I don 't think I have a cage big enough for you , Max . Dr. Martinez is going to help you . And I 'm sure Lady won 't mind the company , will you , Lady ? You see ? It 's going to be fine . I think she likes him . Lady 's special . So is Max . Well , then I would say it 's a match made in ... somewhere , right ? TAWNl : Don 't worry . He 'll be fine . Come by tomorrow , and , hopefully , I will know something by then . Thank you . Thanks . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm just worried about Max . Oh . You know , you don 't have to keep on helping me . We 've been even since the flyers . Yeah , I know . But I guess this is sort of what older brothers do fortheir little sisters , you know ? After all , we are family . Right ? That 's right . You don 't need to worry , little sis . Everything 's going to be fine , I promise . You again ? Listen , we 're not interested , okay ? I 've got a whole lot of stuff I 'm dealing with right now , mister . I know . You know ? You know what ? What do you know ? I know about your dog . What happened to him . Look , um ... it was my fault . I work for a company called Envigormax , and they kidnapped your dog and forced me to inject him with a serum . Things just got kind of out of hand , and I ... I didn 't stop things when I should have . Look , the good news is I can help . I can restore him . Please ? What am I talking about ? I wouldn 't trust me , either . Look , um ... I 'm going to leave you my number , okay ? So if you change your mind , you call me . I 'm really sorry ... about everything . Please help us . I have never seen anything like this . Max , you are a regular phenomenon . And I need to get something to eat . You two behave now , okay ? I 'll be back to finish up . I have a feeling it 's going to be a long night . Look what fell out of the ugly tree . Nighty-night . It 's not good to go to bed angry . Pfft . What 's going on here ? Uh , monster rescue . I 'm going to place him in nice home , cutest little laboratory . All the latest accommodations . He has a home , and that is where he is going . Now get out . My pleasure . Consider it done . I just hope I 'm not too late . Hurry ! Mean lady . Where are you taking those children ? Uh ... An evil corporation kidnapped their dog , gave it a serum , turned it into a monster mutt , now I 'm taking them back to my lab to give it another serum to turn it back into a normal dog ? Well , why didn 't you say so ? - Well , we thought we 'd sound crazy . - Monster mutt , oh , my gosh . That must have been scary , huh ? The dog was like a monster ? - Twice the size of something ... - I don 't think so ! Kidnapper ! Get out of here ! Kidnapper ! You kidnapper ! - Ow ! That one connected . - Get out of here ! Watch Alert ! Unh ! You ! Mrs. Knight , he 's really trying to help us ! Oh , I 'll bet he just told you to say that , didn 't he ? No ! Really , he 's our Uncle Gilroy . Yeah , he 's our ... Uncle Gilroy . Um , we 're just trying to find their dog . What 's its name ? Max . Hmm . You have beautiful eyes , by the way . Seatbelts . Uncle Gilroy ? I 'm sorry . It was all I could think of . Okay , here 's the plan . We 're going to go inside , we 'll sneak Max out the back here , we 'll take him to my laboratory , I 'll give him the serum , and you 'll have your dog back . - Okay . - Okay . - Max ! - No , Ashley ! Wait , you can 't go in there ! Max is in there ! And all those other animals . Okay , okay , all right . Calm , calm . We 're all calm , we 're all calm . Are we calm ? Are we calm ? Yes , we 're calm . Okay , here . Take the phone , okay ? Call 911 . Go back to the car , call 911 . Call 911 . Call 911 . That 's what we do . Okay , let 's ... Hey , wait , Victor ! The cages are in the back . Thanks , Zack . Go , go , go ! All right , Ashley , let 's go . Oh ! Whoa ! Um ... okay , who 's first ? Here you go . Got you . It 's okay . Just stay calm . Stay calm . Go . Run , little buddy ! Go ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Go . It 's all right ! It 's all right ! Rat . Rat , rat , rat , rat , rat ! Run for your life ! Okay , okay , I got you . I got you . Here we go . Where 's Max ? And Dr. Martinez ? I couldn 't find them . - Hey ! - Dad ! What are you guys doing here ? We brought Max to the vet 's office . He needed help . - You found Max ? - Yeah , Dad ! But something happened to him . Hey , sir , is there anyone left in that building ? I don 't know . There was a lot of smoke . I got most of the animals , though , I think . Max and Dr. Martinez , they might still be in there . Dad , you got to go get them ! You guys stay here , okay ? - Okay . - Careful , Daddy ! Are you okay ? - Take a breath . - The animals . You 're okay . Breathe deep . They 're all out . You feel all right ? - Here . - Thank you . What happened here today ? Where 's Max ? There was a woman , and , uh ... she said she was taking him to his new home , and everything went black . Are you saying that Max has been kidnapped ? Forthe second time . I know where he is . - Wait ! - Wait ! We 're coming with you . Now , look , it 's too dangerous , okay ? I gotta do this alone . - Sir , sir . - I need to leave here . - You 've been in a fire . - I have to go . I really have to go . You don 't understand . Let me explain it to you . Oh , look , a turtle , you should pick that up . Can I get you some more water ? I 'm good , really . Thanks again . I better check on my kids . TAWNl : Kids ? Yeah , Ashley and Zack . Ashley and Zack are your kids ? Yeah , yeah . Ashley ! Zack ? Hey , kids ? Ow . Ashley , be quiet . Okay . - Oh ! No , what are you guys doing here ? Now I have to take you home . - No ! - No ! No , you can 't take us home ! You 'd lose too much time backtracking . All right , just stay in the car . I 'll be right back . Hey ! Hey , no . We 're coming with you whether you like it or not . Please , Uncle Gilroy . Let 's go ! Come on . All right , come on in . Max ! Max ! Max ! All right , Max . Got some stuff that 's going to get you back to being a normal dog . What 's up , doc ? Ta-da ! Oh , and I see you brought your little nerdlings with you . So cute . And look , you had the antidote all along . The antidote is forthe dog and the dog only . Yet you 're going to give it to me anyhow . I worked for your dad forten years . He 'd be ashamed of what you 've done with this company . He was a good person , who cared about people . That was his problem . He cared about people instead of business ... or cholesterol , which is actually probably what killed him . You know what ? You didn 't need that dog to bite you to turn you into a monster . You already were one . Oh , look what you did . You turned the words around to hurt my widdle feelings . Nice job , Shakespeare . Now , hand overthe antidote , Dr. Victor . The name is Dr. Lloyd . Mmm ... Mother . Mmm . Time to hurt you . Hey ! Victor 's fine , Victor 's fine , Victor 's fine ! Victor ! Give me the antidote . We 've got it . You just have to guess which one of us has it . Huh ? Go ! Go , Ashley ! Run ! - Aah ! Go ! You get back here ! Ha ha ha ! I don 't think so . Oh , no leaving . All right , kid , give it to me . Fine . - The other hand . - Oh ! Oh ... - Huh ? - Sorry . Ashley ! Do it now ! - Aah ! - No ! Rrrr ! Now it 's just you and me . - Give me the antidote . - No ! Go ! Go ! Ashley , give me that . We have to inject that thing before it kills Max . No ! Then there won 't be any left for Max . Well , if we don 't do something now , that thing 's going to kill him . Huh ? Thanks forthe injection , kid . I appreciate it . I did it for Max , not for you . Doesn 't matter . Eitherway , I win . Only problem is ... you two little monkeys have seen way too much , so now I 'm wondering , what will an overdose of monster serum do to you ? Aaaaah ! Oof ! Oh , and by the way , I 'm sure the police will enjoy the security footage of you trying to give two innocent children an overdose of monster serum , and I 'll be sure to tell the police that your name is ... Victor , you did it ! No , we did it . Max ! You 're okay , boy . See ? I always knew he could shake . Ashley , what 's wrong ? We used all the serum . Now there 's no more left for Max . Rule number one , always have a backup . Victor , you did it . You 're the best , Victor . Who 's a big boy ? Who 's the big boy ? Huh ? Want to lose about 200 pounds ? Here we go . - Hey , Victor . - Oh , hey , guys . How are they ? - How 's who ? - You know . No . Who are you talking about ? You know . Can we see them ? - I 'm just kidding . Want to see them ? - Yes . - Come on back . - Okay . Yay ! TAWNl : I was thinking we would put the built-ins right over here . What do you think ? I think I 'm going to be starving when I 'm done with this . How about I make us dinner at my house ? Tonight ? Six o 'clock ? I 'll be there at five . Hey ! Keep it clean , you two . Nice one , Dad . Hey , Max . Lady . Oh , the puppies are so cute . - Look at this one . - Not bad , Max . Not bad at all . Where are the little puppies ? Over here ! Oh , they are the most adorable little things I 've ever seen . Good job , Max . This one 's for you . Ahem . Mr. Gilroy . Yes ? I just wanted to remind you that , um , bridge night is tonight at my home , and , well , maybe you can drop over around seven ? Seven it is . Or I could stop over at five to set up ? That 'd be nice . Thank you . Come on , Charlie . Yah ! - Mr. Gilroy ? - It 's a long story . - Hi . - Hi . May I help you ? Yeah , rumor has it that you all are looking for good homes for some puppies , and I was hoping I could get one for my daughter . Oh , why , yes . They 're right overthere . Please take your pick . Mommy , I think I found the perfect one . You really know how to pick ' em , don 't you ? Um ... It 's a monstrous little thing , huh ? Yeah . Uh ... I 'm sure he 'll grow into those teeth . - Great choice - It 's getting late . Dad , why don 't I help you with this ?

BEHOLD OVERDRIFT PURGATORIO . DESIGNED BY THE ZEN DRIFTING MONKS OF THE HOKKAIDO REGION , IT REMAINS THE MOST EXTREME OVERDRIFT GAME EVER CONCEIVED . SHOULD A PLAYER BE BRAVE ENOUGH , SKILLED ENOUGH , CRAZY ENOUGH TO TAME ONE OF THE WILD SUPERCARS WITHIN , PURGATORIO SHALL GRANT HIM A JEWEL FIT FOR A KING ! ALAS ... IN THEIR MAD DREAMS TO CONSTRUCT THE ULTIMATE RACER , THE DRIFT MONKS INSTALLED A FEATURE WAY TOO HARDCORE FOR THE CASUAL GAMER . YOU SEE , WHEN YOU ENTER PURGATORIO , YOU CANNOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU WIN . THEY SAY ONE KID GOT TRAPPED IN THERE FOR THREE DAYS . I HEARD ANOTHER KID PEED HIS PANTS . I HEARD A KID DIED . ALL THOSE LEGENDS ARE BOTH TRUE AND UNTRUE , EXCEPT FOR THE ONE WHERE THE KID DIED . THAT 'S WHY THEY BANNED THE GAME AND PURGATORIO VANISHED INTO ANTIQUITY , UNTIL I FOUND A COPY ... ON EBAY .

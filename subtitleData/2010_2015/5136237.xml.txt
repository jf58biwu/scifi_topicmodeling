 Okay - It 's going to work this time . Here we go . Polarity condenser 's at seventy-five percent . Close enough . Here we go . It 's going to work . Come on . And it overloads again . How was the last diagnostic ? We still have a ten second targeting system delay . Acceptable , but barely . I 'm more concerned about containment . If that solar flare is a B Class . We 'll have to shut it down . Great . We have an untested system and we 're giving a personal demonstration to the President . No pressure . Are we ready Dr. Whitlow ? I would feel more comfortable if we had another month . We 're over budget and out of time . This is our one last shot . Thank you , Brian . Good luck . Mr. President . Vice President , Crane . We 're looking forward to this , Brian . Let 's start the show . Yes , sir . Please have a seat . Today we unveil the world 's most advanced global defense system A space-based interceptor armed with unlimited energy . Dr. Jane Whitlow 's going to take us through a demonstration . Thank you . In 2010 , our High an Frequency Disrupter Program made Incredible scientific breakthrough . We discovered how to use high-frequency pulses to affect the Earth 's magnetosphere . The purpose : to eventually combat global warming by affecting weather patterns . But the potential didn 't stop there . We also discovered we could affect the sun 's magnetosphere . And use it to harness incredible power We will start by sending an extreme high-frequency pulse into the sun . How safe is this , Dr. Whitlow ? Very . The pulse will disrupt a localized area in the sun 's magnetic field , releasing an A class solar flare with zero threat potential . Peter , we 're up . Activating ... Five . Four . Three . Two . One . The sun 's released energy will now be collected by our satellite and then re-directed as a focused beam to destroy targeted space objects . Tracking trajectory . Activating solar array . We 're in position . Energy collection in five , four , three , two , one . We 're at maximum capacity . Containment is holding . Mr. President , the unlimited power of the sun has now armed us against any oncoming threat . Be it a rogue missile , satellite or asteroid . For the purpose of this test , we 've chosen one of our decommissioned communication satellites . Peter , fire when ready . Target is locked . Ion beam initialized . Yes ! All right ! That 's what I 'm talking about . That 's the stuff ! Congratulations ! Congratulations , ladies and gentlemen you 've just witnessed the future of global defense . I stuck my neck out to keep this lab . I 'm glad I did . Excellent work , Dr. Whitlow . Thank you . Very impressive . Thank you , very much . We 're in the clear . Well ... we just made history . And our next round of funding . So , can I breathe now ' ? Peter , what just happened ? Massive system failure ! The satellite 's emptying it 's energy banks ! Where ? What 's it targeting ' ? The sun . Shut it down ! Now ! What the hell is going on ? Our satellite just triggered a solar storm . HOW big ? Peter , status . Oh hell ... looks like the first solar flare is an X class ! And how bad is an X class ? Satellites , power grids , electronics , navigation system ... they 'll all be affected . When ' ? Approximately ten minutes . - Wha ... ? ! - You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say or do can and will be held against you in a court of law . You have the right to speak to an attorney . Hey ! Easy , huh . If you can 't afford one , one will be appointed to you . Do you understand ? Yeah , I understand . Do you wish to call a lawyer ? You 'll pay for legal fees , right ? Davis , not a half bad take down . Houston , your pat search was terrible . You didn 't properly handcuff the felon . So you both fail . Failed ' ? Yeah . As in you just screwed up . Your partner makes a mistake , you both pay the price . So , pack up . I want to see you both back at the academy in half an hour . I guess if that was a real situation you probably would have saved my life Yeah . But I think I would have preferred a pass . The dinosaurs were everywhere . They roamed the land . Flew through the air and swam in the seas . But sixty-five million years ago them something happened that totally killed off . Does anyone know what caused the extinction of dinosaurs ? The ice age . Even my baby brother knows that . Thank you , Sam . Extreme climate change is a possibility But it also could have asteroids or global volcanic eruptions . Some scientists even think the huge dinosaurs died off because of several huge disasters combined . So , where 's the guest speaker ? He should be arriving shortly . Peter , what 's our status ? One minute to impact . Right here is why I volunteer to do this every week . Okay ? Now , the second reason . Exercise . Let 's pick up the pace and work those glutes ! Come on ! Watch your step . Hey . I was getting worried . Well , the traffic was terrible . I 'm not that late anyway , am I ? You 're ten and a half minutes late . Ten and a half minutes . Guys , it 's my pleasure to introduce Acclaimed scientist , Dr. Michael Ranger . Okay - I 'm here today to talk to you about what it is that I do . And why science is such a great profession . Did you feel that ? Was that a tremor ? Earthquake ! Give me your hand . What ? ! Watch it ! Watch it ! Where do we go ? Everybody stay calm ! Get off the street ! Come on ! Hurry . Let 's go . Move ! This is what we 're going to do . We 're going to exit the building nice and calmly . Stay calm . Exit the building . Guys , hang on ! Breathe in through the nose , not through the mouth . Breathe . Call 911 ! We 'll look for survivors . Thank you for saving my life . That 's all right . Don 't worry about it . Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm okay . Yeah . Dad , I can 't get a signal . Neither can I. That was no ordinary earthquake . We just got hit by a solar flare . Guys , help me get this off him . It was a 6.5 magnitude earthquake . For a class X.9 solar flare , it could have been worse . How the hell does a solar flare cause an earthquake ? Its impact on the outer atmosphere of had the energy of one billion megatons TNT . It literally wobbled the Earth on its axis . Dr. Whitlow , what exactly have we done ? Like hurricanes we have categories for global catastrophic threats . Category 5 , global economic impact . Six , a breakdown of infrastructure in society . Seven , the destruction of the human race . Eight , the destruction of the planet . This may qualify as a category 5 . No , no . We need time to assess this situation . What happened here today is a matter of national security . Mr. President , we are the only ones who know what caused this thing . And for the good of this country , I believe it 's important that it stay that way . Agree . We can 't allow this government to be undermined with an environmental scandal when we have a population to protect . Understood ? Alright . I am declaring a nation-wide state of emergency I want all planes in the US grounded , but for military flights . I want all military sectors on high alert . Get me FEMA , Homeland Security . I want the director of Central Intelligence in the Oval Office in twenty minutes ! All right . Listen , I 'm sure everybody 's family is fine . As soon as the cell phones start working again Karen 'll call your parents and let them know you 're okay . Good ? Look . There you go . - Hello . - Michael . I 'm trying to get through to Karen . Is she okay ? No , no . She 's fine . Don 't worry . Please tell her I 'm okay . And we 'll see her at home . The cell signals are totally out of wack . I think it was a solar storm that caused this . It must be wreaking havoc on everything electronic . Including cell signals . Bev , what 's wrong ? We just watched a passenger plane fall out of the sky . I 'm sorry . It 's a mess here . I 'm waiting for fire and rescue . Listen Bev , you can handle this . Just go home . Karen and I will meet you there as soon as we can . Thank you , Michael . I mean that . All right . Bye . Is Mom okay ? Yeah . She 's just a little shaken up . Okay - Yeah . All right ? Okay - Let 's call your parents first . All right . Go ahead . Tell me the number . There are wide spread communications and power disruptions throughout the country . Death tolls are trickling in . At the moment it stands at 140 , but that does not include the three passenger planes that are currently unaccounted for . What about the rest of the world ? The solar flare struck the Northern Hemisphere . Europe should be comparable to us . Same with parts of Central America . We 've been in contact with Canada , the UK and France and their damages seem to be only to their power grids as well . How long will this last ? This is the largest solar storm we 've ever seen . It could last a couple of days , or it could last a week . The region of the sun that was hit is still very volatile . That 's true , but I think the key here is to avoid feeding panic . We 're going to have the power grids up and running in all major cities by tonight . Military and government communication has not been affected . I think it 's safe to say that the worst of this is behind us . Well , at least that 's something . Let 's work that into the national address . And what if the worst isn 't behind us ? Well , with all due respect , Vice President , Crane , it is . My fellow Americans , today at 10 : 12 am Pacific time , the Northern Hemisphere was struck by a class X solar flare . This unprecedented event triggered a series of global earthquakes , disrupted our power grids , communications and transport systems . This solar flare is the first wave of a geomagnetic storm that will plague our planet for the next 48 hours . But there is no need to panic . Our government and military infrastructures remain unaffected . Everything is under control . Yeah , right . You just know when they say that has " everything 's under control " the crap hit the fan . Texting Tim ? When that earthquake hit , I kept seeing his face . If I ever lost him ... why don 't you like him ? It 's not that I don 't like him , it 's ... look , I know it 's none of my business , but I 've been doing some research . What kind of research ? Dad , spit it out . Statistically , 75 % of marriages to police officers end in divorce . 19 % in domestic violence . Are you kidding me ' ? Well , the stats don 't lie . That means you have a 6 % chance at a successful marriage . Dad , will stop with the stats ? I love Tim . And he 's the nicest , most respectful man on the planet . Okay . All right . I just worry about you . You don 't need to worry . I can take care of myself . Are you okay ? Yeah.You ? I 'm fine . I couldn 't reach your grandfather . I 'll check out back . I 'll check by the lake . Okay . Okay . Governor ! Governor ! Governor ! Governor . Here . Looks like you cut your head . Why the heck do you keep calling me " Governor " ? I haven 't been a governor for twenty years . All right . From now on , I 'm going to call you Willy . Dad ! He 's up here ! In the study ! - Dad ! - He 's going to be all right . Oh God . Don 't stand there gawking . Help an old man up . All right . Mr. President , Brian has got a very good reason to down play the solar storm . It was his program that got us into this mess in the first place and he 's simply trying to protect his ass . I 'll take your opinion into consideration . That 's all I ask . Come in . Sir , you have a call . It 's NASA administrator . It 's urgent . President Duncan . When ' ? Is this an isolated event ? Thank you . We may have another situation . The second you get back , you send all your data to NASA . Brian , this is spiraling out of control . The HFD program never should have been rushed . It was a calculated risk meant to meet a deadline . That 's it . A risk without proper simulations . You forced my team to ignore protocols . Mistakes were made . But we 've got to move forward . We 're going to fix this . I hope we can , before more people die Did you feel that ? We just got hit by another solar flare . When 's this going to stop ? Hi . Jack ! I 'm so glad you 're home . It 's going to be okay . What 's the inside scoop , Jack ? It 's a solar storm . A bad one , but we 've seen it before . Forty-eight hours tops and everything will be back to normal . A solar storm that hits that hard and this fast doesn 't disappear in two days . It 's being down-played to avoid panic . Your ex sounds like a conspiracy nut . And you sound like a typical senator 's lackey . Well , whatever the hell is going on , hopefully we 're through the worst of it . I 'm sorry , William , but this is just getting started . We 've got magnetic fields going haywire . Birds are dying , planes are falling from the sky . Conjecture . Jack , what I saw today was was a terrible tragedy and a horrible coincidence . Well , think about it Bev , if this solar storm is as bad as Michael says it is , why aren 't there hundreds of planes dropping out of the sky ? Because right now the pockets of electromagnetic pulses are random and dispersing quickly . Ventually the atmosphere is going to become oversaturated . E Affecting everything electrical . Okay , maybe we 're over-reacting . Right now the most important thing is that we 're prepared . We need to go to town and stockpile food and water for at least a month . For a two day solar storm ? Seriously ? Seriously . I mean , who should we believe , the President of the United States in consultation with the greatest minds of the world or one disgraced scientist ? I rest my case . Come on , Michael . I 'll help you get those supplies . Have fun shopping . Jack Hillcroft . Yes , Senator , we 're back on-line . Jack 's a senator 's aide . He knows what 's going on . Yeah , well my father 's a scientist with a doctorate in solar physics . I think he knows what he 's talking about , Mom What 's going on ? This keeps getting worse . DOD just placed us on satellite watch . Solar flares ? They 're knocking satellites out of orbit . Fast . Five seconds to impact . An M class solar flare . We might feel this one ! Great . NASA 's requesting the coordinates of any satellites at risk . They 're desperate . How many satellites are designed to burn up completely upon re-entry ' ? A few smaller models would disintegrate , but the average communication satellite weighs five tons . The bulk of it will stay intact . So , almost thirty-five hundred satellites are at risk of becoming fire balls ' ? ! Technically over 10,000 if you include non-operational . Contact the space station . Let 's see what kind of information they have . I 'm on it . What 's the trajectory of that one ? It 's dropping right above London . Dr. Whitlow . You 've been updated ? Just now . Brian , we 're about to have satellites striking populated areas . We may have underestimated this thing . You think we may have over-reacted just a little ' ? Trust me Governor . In a couple of days , you 'll be grateful . Hi ya , Governor ! We 're making the rounds . Checking on the neighbors after all that chaos . Greatly appreciated , Geoffrey . Put please , call me William . Of course . - Edna . - Hello . What 's with all the supplies ? Oh , best to be prepared . That solar storm 's only going to get worse . You want to make sure you have a lot of dry goods and plenty of water . Listen to him , Geoffrey . The man 's a scientist . That sounds good . We 're going to check on Miss Swanson . Let us know if she needs anything . We 're pretty well equipped . Hey , Dr. Ranger . Governor . Tim . Officer Davis . Uh , what 's all the stuff ' ? Why don 't you make yourself useful . Sure . I 'm sorry I lost my cool with Michael . That guy gets under my skin . Jack , after what I saw today , it put things into perspective . You know , life 's too short to be holding grudges . You got to let it go . I know . You 're right . Hey , Tim . Oh , hey . Your folks okay ? Yeah , they 're good . Hey . What 's the matter ? I need you all to see this . It 's a clip from London . London ? Yeah . Oh , my God . It was some kind of fire ball . It totally destroyed Big Ben . It 's not a fire ball . It 's a satellite knocked out of its orbit by the solar storm . Is this going to keep happening ? Yeah . Why didn 't they see it coming ' ? They should 've . The space weather center can forecast these things days in advance . Something 's happening . Like what ? I won 't know until I analyze the solar storm data . But right now we need to move quick . Let 's finish unloading the truck . I 'll head back to the barn , pick up a generator and some more supplies . I 'll get my old radio out of the garage and dig out the emergency kit . Good . We 'll need it . Jack , what do you know about the Special Routing Arrangement Service ? SRAS ' ? It 's a secure government network independent of public internet cell phones . It 's used to shield military satellites . We 're going to lose internet and cell phone service any minute . That hardware could keep us connected . I 'll head into the office now and sign out an access key . I was so worried . Me too . You okay ? It 's getting scary out there . I 'll protect you . Tim , what are you doing ? Nothing . I , I wasn 't doing anything . Honestly . No , I don 't mean that . I mean what are you doing right now ? What , whatever you need . Good . I need you to help me pick up a generator and some more supplies . Sure . Done . I think I 've been drafted . It 's okay . He doesn 't bite . Are you sure ? Hey ! We don 't have all day . I just spoke with NASA . Cloud-Sat and Terra just went down . They can 't get through to the space station . Any ideas ? Try skipping the signal off a satellite in the upper orbit . Anik E1 is still operational . Contact with the space station coming up now . Well , that 's strange . It 's a live transmission . That thing is the only portable High Frequency Disrupter in existence . High Frequency Disrupter ' ? It sends EHF pulses into our magnetosphere . Why ? To manipulate the weather . Hopefully it will reverse global warming . Is that you ? Karen drew that when she was five years old . Give it to me . Thank you . The gas cans are in the corner . The generator 's in the back . Next to the manure bags . Of course it is . Mmhm . Oh , my God . Son of a ... ls everything okay ? My satellite picked up a high frequency post that was targeted at the sun . It triggered the solar storm . You have your own satellite ? Sort of . Technically it was decommissioned . Who would target the sun ' ? This is bad . This is really , really bad . It originated at the HFD Facility outside of Boston . Who else knows about this ? I 'm the only civilian monitoring the EHF pulses . This had to be the government . They 're covering it up . Pick up , Jane . All right . Change of plans . Let 's load up . We 're going someplace else . To do what ? You ask a lot of questions . I 'm a cop . You 're a cadet . Let 's go . London 's a mess . We 've got the UN saying it was an isolated incident . We now have eighteen " isolated incidents " . What about telling the truth ? Cause more mass panic ? No , thank you . We 're dealing with it . All the satellites in lower to mid-orbit are shutting down , including the space station . It 's the size of a football field , Brian . That should disintegrate upon re-entry . It was designed to de-orbit in a controlled manner with its debris shower aimed at the ocean . But with this compromised electromagnetic field ... it 's going to hit the Earth like a nuclear blast . Ah , Jack ! Good timing . We lost cell phone service and our land line 's down . Karen , give this to your father . - It 's the key . - How does it work ? Plug it in to a USB port and it 'll connect automatically . Okay - My fellow Americans , the unexpected size and intensity of the solar storm is disrupting lower orbital satellites . Some are burning up as they enter the atmosphere . Unfortunately some are making their way back to Earth with destructive results . Today 's devastating strike on central London has been traced to a malfunction in outer ... Ah , lost him . I have to get back to the office . It 's chaos . Okay - Be careful . I will . Mom , where are they ? - Can I see your ID , please . - Yeah . I 'm a civilian scientist . Dr. Whitlow is a personal friend . This is my associate . I 'll be right back . Yeah . Okay - What am I getting myself into ? Just relax . Dr. Whitlow was my partner when I worked in Alaska . Wasn 't that where you sabotaged your own research three years ago ? Karen must have said something about that ... to me . It was an ethical decision . Let 's just leave it at that . Thank you . There are no scheduled appointments with Dr. Whitlow . What does that mean ? Please leave the premises immediately . No . You listen to me , that solar flare is a threat to the entire human race . Sir , I 'm not going to ask again . Listen ... Come on , Dr. Ranger . Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go home . Everyone 's expecting us . I can 't just drive away . I 'm the guy that made the HFD program that created this mess . You heard what he said , they 're not letting us in . There must be another way . If we could just get past those guards . We ' ? Yeah . I can 't do this alone . You 're asking me to break the law . I 'm a police cadet . Listen , in a few days there might not be any law . Do you know how crazy you sound right now ? I do . But this is getting worse . And we 've got to do something . Now . Come on . That 's it . See , that wasn 't hard . 'Til someone gets electrocuted . What now ? We find Dr. Whitlow . I can 't believe I 'm doing this . You two ! Halt ! - Oh crud . - Halt ! Hold it right there ! Hands in the air ! Come on ! Get down ! - Down . - Down on the ground ! Come on ! We 're here to see Dr. Whitlow . On your knees . Now ! Hands behind your head . We have eighty in-coming satellites . I need trajectories and impact estimates . We can 't calculate that many . Then prioritize . Urban strike zones first . Guesstimate if you have to ! Jane , two intruders have been captured . One of them is Michael Ranger . Tell security to detain them . I 'll deal with Dr. Ranger later . Okay - Detain them . Dr. Whitlow will deal with them later . We 've had reports of falling satellites hitting Athens , Cairo , Mumbai . And our own missiles couldn 't stop strikes on Maui and Texas . Can anyone explain that to me ' ? Anyone ? The solar storm has intensified to the point that our military systems have been compromised , sir . Do we get China on board ? Yes , sir . Along with Russia , Great Britain , France . Canada . Australia . But their anti-missile arsenals are being affected as well . How many satellites are going to drop on us ' ? Hundreds . We 're at category six threat level . And we can 't stop these things from crashing into us ? I 'm sorry , sir . The space station , it 's started a re-entry . Where and when ? Tracking ... Come on , Peter ! I need a location . It 's going to fall on Chicago . I want to speak with NATO and the UN Security Council . Brian Lee . Put her through . Brian , in fifty-two minutes the space station 's going to hit Chicago . It 's blast radius is going to wipe out the city . We have to evacuate government officials . Government officials ? ! In less than an hour 2.7 million people are going to die , Brian . There 's nothing else to do ! It 's too late . I never should have let you talk me into this . I 'm going to be charged with trespassing , breaking and entering . I can 't have a record , they 'll kick me out of the academy . Yeah . You 'd be doing yourself a favor . How could you say that ' ? This is all I ever wanted to be . What have I ever done to piss you off ? I don 't want my daughter marrying a cop . Why do you want to be a cop , anyway ? My dad was a police officer for thirty years . I 'll admit it was hard . He worked long hours . It was dangerous . But he always had this quote he 'd tell me all the time , " All it takes for bad people to prevail is for good people to do nothing . " Even as a little kid , I could remember my dad sticking up for the little guy . There 'll never be a big parade for him , or the key to the city , but he helped people anyway he could . And that made a real difference in the world . And I want to do the same . That was a big one . Thirty seconds to impact . At 7 pm Eastern time , a falling satellite laid waste to several city blocks in Boston . In comes on the heels of the biggest disaster ever to be unleashed on American soil , the total destruction of downtown Chicago . Mom ... it 's been four hours . Something must have happened . Maybe they had engine trouble . You know , your father 's truck is not exactly reliable . He 's right . And your father drives me insane , but he 's also the most resourceful man I know . And he 's with Tim . Those two can handle anything . I know . But still , I can 't just wait . You 're exhausted . Get some sleep . We 'll do shifts . Okay - I 'll try . I 'll wake you in a few hours . Jane . This isn 't your fault . Oh , no . What ? It 's the sun . You see that black patch on the sun 's surface ? Yeah . That 's the sun spot we created with the ion beam . It 's now a hundred thousand kilometers from end to end . Four times bigger than the Earth . So what 's it going to do ? Emit another X class solar flare ? No . It 's going to be a giant cloud of magnetized , radioactive particles . The biggest coronal mass ejection we 've ever seen . Hey , grandpa . Can I come in ? Sure . Have a seat for a minute . I wanted to give this to you . Your grandmother gave me this compass during my very first campaign . We were still dating at the time , but you know , Jen already had me figured out . She told me it was a reminder to always choose the right path . And never compromise my beliefs . I 've kept this compass with me ever since . It 's been a reminder to always follow my heart . Because that 's our true compass . Anyhow ... I figure it 's time to pass it on . Think of it as a , as a good luck charm Thank you . We 'll get through this . Okay . Try to get some sleep . I will . Calculating trajectory . Direct hit on the northern hemisphere . ETA seven hours , twenty-two minutes . Get out that data now ! And get NASA working on impact simulations . Well , how could this possibly be getting worse ? Forget the storm , forget the satellites . We have a coronal mass ejection heading for Earth . We 're going to need some response scenarios for the President . The HFD may be an option . Peter , bring up Dr. Ranger . Dr. Ranger ? He 's already here . I swore if that man even so much as stepped foot on a government facility , I would have him shot . He 's still the smartest man I know . Brian , this CME could wipe out all life on this planet . The brightest minds in the world are trying to figure out how to stop it . We do not need Michael Ranger . Now excuse me , but I 've got to go contact the President . Hello , Michael . You 've been busy . Who 's your friend ? My daughter 's boyfriend . Tim Davis . What are you doing here ? What do you think I 'm doing here ? It was the HFD program that created the solar flare , isn 't it ? We 're doing everything we can to fix it . And how 's that going ? I need your help . Really ? You need my help . Can you just take a look at this ? That 's the largest CME ever recorded . And it 's heading straight for Earth . That sounds bad . Very . The impact will be catastrophic . All thanks to Jane and her weapon of mass destruction . It was weapon that caused this , right ? I knew it . You knew why I destroyed that program and you went ahead and created a weapon . Didn 't you ? ! Are you done ' ? For now . Look , you still know more about this than anybody else ! Help me use it to stop this ! Dr. Ranger has nothing to offer us except an admission that he destroyed an HFD facility . Mr. Secretary , I don 't like you . I don 't like what you do and I don 't like what you represent . But Jane is right . You need me . So , I 'm at your disposal . Yes , you are . Dr. Whitlow , the President needs a briefing . We have another option . I 'm sorry . Me too . Now , Dr. Whitlow . That went well . What do we do now ? In six hours the coronal mass ejection will reach Earth . It will ignite parts of our atmosphere and burn off our ozone . Unless we 're deep underground we won 't survive . Mr. President , global threat level now is at category 7 , the imminent destruction of all human life . Oh , my God . There may be a way to stop it before impact , Mr. President . A deep space military satellite with a nuclear reactor . Heavily shielded . We can reposition it in the path of the CME and detonate . NASA thinks that the blast will disperse the plasma . Brian , I 'm authorizing you to make this happen now . We 'll coordinate that from here , sir . I 'll see you shortly . Get your team to work . NASA needs that repositioning data immediately . Dad ? Tim ? Karen , you okay ? Yeah . Where 've you been all night ? I was locked up with your father . What ? ! It 's a long story . Did Jack get you that SRAS key ? Good . Come on , we 've got a lot of work to do . Detonation in ten seconds . 'IO , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . What 's the status ? 2.4 % reduction in mass . No change in trajectory . It absorbed the blast . There must be some other option . I 'm sorry , sir . Nothing in the present time frame . My fellow Americans , our world is about to face its greatest threat . In approximately three hours our planet will collide with a coronal mass ejection . Which is a massive solar cloud released by our sun . It 's impact could potentially destroy our ozone layer leaving us vulnerable to lethal levels of UV radiation . I want to assure each and everyone of you that everything possible is being done to avert this disaster . At the very best to minimize its impact . There are measure you can take to protect yourself during this unprecedented event . Seek shelter in basements subways , anywhere that 's underground . Take with you as much food and water as you possibly can . And above all , keep your loved ones close . We will face this threat together . We are Americans . We are brave . We are strong . And we will prevail . God bless each and everyone of you . And God bless these United States of America . Thank you . If the world 's going to end , let 's just do it . Let 's get married . Are you serious ? Yeah . Right now . You made it . Yeah . I wish it could have been nicer . I think it 's beautiful . I , Timothy Davis , hereby take you , Karen Ranger , for my Wife , to have and to hold , from this moment on , until death do us part . I , Karen Ranger , hereby take you , Timothy Davis , for my husband , to have and to hold , from this moment on , 'til death do us part . Wow . We 're kinda married . Operation Haven is a top secret project , years in the making , designed for a crisis such as this . It 's a network of underground facilities throughout the US connected directly to the White House bunker . Which will also serve as Haven 's communication center . There 's only room for 150 , 000 people . Key government and military personnel as well as a select group of professionals and trades people necessary for a society to survive . If you are in this room , you 're on the list . Gather your families . Quickly . Beverly ! Bev ! Beverly . Pack your bags fast . Only the essentials . We 're leaving . What do you mean , we 're leaving ? Operation Haven . What 's that ? A network of government underground shelters . I never thought I would live to see it used . Go get Karen . What about our neighbors and our friends ? Beverly , they 're not on the list . There 's no time to discuss this ! What about Michael and Tim ? ! Come on . Karen . Karen 's gone . We have to go look for her . Bev , we don 't have time . She 's my daughter ! I 'm not leaving without her ! Go find her ! I 'll stay here in case she comes back . Forty minutes . If we can 't find her in forty minutes , we come back here , get William , and we leave . Jack , you find her . You don 't come back for me . William . You give my place to Tim . Go . Listen , you were right about the High Frequency Disrupter . It can stop this . It 's too late . The facility 's been shut down and evacuated . No . There 's still a chance . The key is to use the High Frequency Disrupter as a shield . What are you talking about ? I 've been running simulations . The CME are negatively charged particles . If we use the disrupter to negatively charge the Earth 's magnetic field , it 'll be like two similar magnetic poles repelling one another . The Earth can deflect it ! The HFD can 't do that with a negatively charged frequency pulse . It 's too localized . Unless it 's an uninterrupted beam . It 'll spread exponentially . The system wasn 't designed for that . It would have to be reconfigured . Well , I 'm willing to try . My system password is Whitlow 2464 Security code is Alpha 6832 . Got it . Michael ... you only have two hours . Don 't worry about it . I 'll be fine . Load up . We 're moving out . Wait ... what was that ? Tim taught me . What ? She wanted to learn how to handle a weapon . I don 't even want to know . Tim ! Tim , are you home ? Mr. Davis ! Mrs. Davis ! We 'll try the barn . Maybe she 's with Michael . Bev ! Do it , Jack ! What the hell was that ? I don 't know . But it 's getting worse . There 's a solar flare . That might have been an X class . Why are we stopping ? Because I don 't want my spark plugs to get ruined by that EMP blast . What 's happening ? ! Hang on ! Jack ! Bev ' ? Bev . Bev . Oh , my ... I think it 's over . Yeah . You gotta be kidding me . The solar flare must have killed it . We should 've bought a new battery . We 'll have to jump start it . Put it in second . Pop the clutch . There 's one coming ! It 's going to be close . Push ! Pop the clutch ! - There 's another one ! - Pop the clutch ! Pop the clutch ! Pop it now ! Almost ! How long has she been like this ? Maybe an hour . We were in a car accident . All entrants please proceed to Station A for processing . Blast doors will close in one hour . Pupillary dilation is normal . There 's no swelling from the injury . Mr. Hillcroft , do you have any more family coming ' ? Mr. Hillcroft ! No . Just my wife and I. Let 's get her to the ME . Thank you , Jane . Come on . Come on . Okay - That 's it . We 're in . How much time before impact ? I don 't want to know . Forty minutes . And hypothetically , ten minutes to negatively charge the ionosphere . Hypothetically They still have one satellite connected . It 's monitoring the CME . Headsets . What do I do ? I want you to keep us posted on the countdown . All right . I 'm setting the target . Wide dispersal in the ionosphere , 1000 km , maximum intensity . Okay - Now , we override the safety systems . Bypass the polarity condensers . We 'll hard wire the generators together right into the antennae array . It 'll give us one continuous negatively charged beam instead of an oscillating pulse . How do we hard wire the generators ? Very quickly . All right . Tim , grab your tool bag . I really hope you know what you 're doing . Piece of cake . All right , here 's what we 're going to do . We passed a rack of black cables when we were coming in . I want you to take them and daisy-chain each of those generators together . Can you do that ? Daisy-chain them ? Yeah . We 're going to connect all the generators and create one massive generator . Got it . Move ! Operation Haven 's been completed . This bunker is now linked with all of our other facilities . And the CME ' ? Twenty-four minutes to impact . Seal the bunker . How 's it going ? We 're attached to the array conduit . Now we just have to hard wire the generators . The insulation ring is stuck . We better get it un-stuck pretty damn quick ! It won 't budge . Come on . Dad , you have thirty seconds before the frequency beam starts . There 's too much static ! I can 't hear you ! Why 's it humming ? Because it 's already initiated . It 's going to release a gigawatt of power whether we 're connected to it or not ! Dad , if you can hear me , the frequency disrupter has commenced countdown . Ten ... Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three ... two , one . Dad ! Dad , can you hear me ? Come on ! Let 's go . Dad , say something ! Come on , go ! Go ! Go ! It 's working . One continuous beam . Can the system sustain that ' ? Hopefully . Well , this it , William , old man . Come on . Show me what you got . The atmosphere is negatively charging 23 % . 32 % . Please work . Will it be enough of a shield ? It 's going to be close . Listen , you two have to get out of here . What ? Why ? The beam needs to be uninterrupted right til the end . The impact of the CME is going to cause a reverb effect down the beam to its source . Dad , what are you saying ? You mean feedback ? A power surge ? It 's going to destroy the array . I 'll stay here and maintain the beam , but you two have to get out of here . It 's too dangerous . No way in hell , am I leaving you . We 're in this together . Karen , we gotta go . No ! I 'm not leaving you ! Listen , Karen , I 'll be right behind you . I 'll make it . But you never make it on time ! You 're always late for everything . I will this time . I promise . You have to leave . It 's been an honor to serve with you , Mr. President . It 's been a pleasure to serve with you . CME impact in five , four , three , two , one . Here it comes . Jack " . Where 's Karen ? Dad ! What happened with the CME ? Solar radiation is 12 % . Penetration of the thermosphere holding at 150 kilometers . Any causalities ? No . The atmosphere is still intact . Oh my , God ! We survived ! We made it ! Hallelujah . Okay - Dad ? Dad ? You 're okay . Hey . The explosion must have knocked me out . Help me up . Yeah . Oh , baby ... You did it ! You saved the whole world ! Yeah . I kinda did , didn 't I ' ? My calculations worked . I don 't think the Defense Secretary 's going to be too happy . Yeah ... well , better get you home . You 're hurt . I 'm okay . I 'm so glad you 're home . You brought our baby home . Yeah . That 's a bad cut . What happened to your head ? We had a close call , but we made it safe and sound . Thank God . You okay ? You look like you 've been through the war . Oh , it 's nothing that a good hot shower can 't take care of . Dad saved the world tonight . - Come inside for a drink . - Naw ... Let 's celebrate . Thanks . I gotta get back to the lab . I couldn 't have done it without you . Both of you . Thanks . Good night . Get some rest . I 'll bring you guys a generator . Thanks . Well , let 's have that drink . Yeah . Yeah . Come on . In the house . My fellow Americans , we witnessed a miracle tonight . A disaster was averted . The coronal mass ejection which threatened our very survival was deflected by the Earth 's ionosphere . As our sun settles , the solar storm will diminish over the next two days . We are safe . The damage will be repaired . Homes will be rebuilt . New satellites will be launched . Our great nation will rise again stronger than ever before . Together , with our friends and allies we will all face a better tomorrow . I guess we kinda jumped the gun on getting married , huh ' ? You mean how we skipped the proposal and went straight to the wedding vows We can slow down ... make it all official . I would love to make it official . Get you a proper ring . This one 's growing on me . Hey ... check it out . Your compass has gone haywire . That 's weird . Oh , my God . It was you , wasn 't it ' ? Listen ... The calculations worked , but when the CME was deflected it ... It compromised the integrity of the magnetosphere . I know . Reports have been trickling in , but we 're , we 're still dealing with the effects of the storm . We 're working with 10 % of our normal resources . I 'll analyze what I can on my end . In the meantime ... Michael ? Get off me ! Michael , what 's happening ? Michael ? What is this ? ! Let go of me ! Where 're you taking me ? ! Michael ! Michael ! It 's still spinning . I don 't like this . Something 's going on . What the hell is that ? Wow . It 's beautiful . This is all wrong . It 's a huge Aurora Borealis . Tim , this isn 't over . Mr. President ... Vice President Crane . Today we unveil the world 's most advanced global defense system . Peter , what just happened ? Massive system failure . In approximately three hours our planet will collide with a massive solar cloud released by our sun . It 's impact could potentially destroy our ozone layer . Leaving us vulnerable to lethal levels of UV radiation . All thanks to Jane and her weapon of mass destruction . If the world 's going to end then let 's then let 's just do it . Let 's get married . Brian , we 're about to have satellites striking populated areas . It 's going to hit the Earth like a nuclear blast . We may have underestimated this thing . Seal the bunker . We use the destructor negatively charge the Earth 's magnetic field it 'll be like two similar magnet poles repelling one another . The Earth can deflect it ! Dad ! You saved the whole world ! Yeah . Oh , my God ! We survived ! The solar storm will diminished over the next two days . We are safe . Tim ... this isn 't over . Oh , my God . In the meantime Statistically , you run a higher risk of breaking your hand than you do my face . You realize that , don 't you ? Dr. Ranger . Why are you doing this to me ? You destroyed a three hundred million dollar government facility . You 're an enemy of the state . I think destroying the HFD program was worth it . Don 't you ? I mean , after all it saved the world . Sadly , we can 't find any data to back up that assertion . You gave me a giant headache three years ago with your little " malfunction " . It 's not going to happen again . The country 's a mess and you 're living out a personal vendetta ? You need to learn to prioritize , Mr. Secretary . And you need to get used to your surroundings , Dr. Ranger . Because I have the power to detain enemy combatants indefinitely without a trial . My fellow Americans , I stand before you proud and humbled by your strength and courage . The citizens across this great nation rallied in the face of danger anything we 've ever seen before . Friends , family , neighbors , strangers came together with one goal in mind . Survival . Sadly , lives were lost , homes destroyed . But we are rebuilding as I speak . Will it happen again ? I 've been assured that the chances of a solar storm of that magnitude happening again are one in a trillion . It 's over . And as promised , refugee centers across the country are getting food , water , shelter and medical aid . Now , what I need from you I need your patience and your understanding . You think you guys can give me some of that ' ? Sure is hot out here . Stand proud ! Wear your courage like a badge of honor . I salute you . God Bless ! No , no ! Calm down . Stay calm . This is just an aftershock . It will pass ! What can I do for you , Jane ? Brian , why aren 't you returning my phone calls ? I 've been trying to get a hold of you . I am busy . We 've all been busy . What 's on your mind ? I got a phone call from Dr. Ranger a few hours ago . He 's worried about the magnetosphere And he 's right . It 's deteriorating . Okay - What are we talking about here ? Short term , communication , navigational failures . Long term , we 'll bombarded by solar radiation . You sure about this ? I am ! And , and there 's something else , when I was on the phone with him , I heard somebody attacking him . I think he 's been abducted . He 's been taken under custody . What ? ! He destroyed a government facility . Jane , he 's an enemy of the state . He saved the world last night ! We have no proof of that . We got lucky ! No way in hell did we get lucky ! And you know it ! Brian , we need his expertise . Where is he ? ! I don 't trust him . So I am keeping him somewhere where I can watch over him . Yes ? Oh , no . Has the Vice President been told ' ? No , no . I 'll do it . What ? There 's been an accident . President Duncan has been killed . It 's hotter than hell out here . It 's beyond hot . Maybe this 'll help . Glad we moved the cars into the shade . Yeah . Anything ? Nothing . He 's not answering . Maybe the remnants of the solar storm . I don 't think so . I 'm getting through , he 's just not picking up . This isn 't like Dad . I 'm sure he 's fine . Probably just cooped up in his barn . No . Somethings wrong . I 'm going over there . I 'm coming with you . I 'll come . Thank you , Grandpa , but we 'll take the motorbike , it 's quicker . Alright . Call us when you get there . We will . What 's all this about , Brian ' ? Alice ... What ? What is it ? President Duncan is dead . How ? There was a localized tremor at the speech today . He was killed by falling debris ten minutes ago . Notify the Chief Justice and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Dad ! Dad , you in here ? Looks like there was a struggle . I don 't understand . There 's a lot of foot marks . Must have been a few of them . Dad 's phone . Check who he called last . Jane Whitlow . I 'm calling her . Michael ! No , it 's Karen , Michael Ranger 's daughter . Is this Dr. Whitlow ? Yes , it is , but I , I can barely hear you . I 'm calling about my dad . He 's missing . I 'm in his lab . It looks like there was a struggle . I think I know where he is . I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States . And will , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . Madam President . Thank you . Congratulations , Madam President . Thanks , very much . Congratulations . Thank you . President Crane . The country needs a strong Vice President . As the new commander-in-chief , you should issue an executive order appointing somebody immediately . I 've already talked to Governor Maxwell of Michigan . Madam President congratulations . Thanks so much . Thank you . I 'm not in the mood for entertaining . So , unless you 've come to offer up an apology , or set me free , I 've got nothing to say to you . Seems like your little stunt with the high frequency disrupter 's causing the Earth 's magnetosphere to deteriorate . The CME caused that . The frequency disrupter saved the planet . All you did was postpone the inevitable . What 's this ? We are running out of time . So , let 's just get to the point . The Earth is heating up . And our scientists can 't agree on a reason why . Well , it 's possible that when the coronal mass ejection was deflected , it stalled the core 's rotation . Look , there 's a lot of energy down there . The Earth 's core could be overheating . So , if we can restart the core , we can reverse the deterioration of the magnetosphere ? That 's what I 'm saying . How do we restart the core ? Let me out of here and I 'll show you . No , no , no , no , no . I need you right here . Listen , I have no intention of helping you . Oh , yes , you do . Because you are not the kind of man who 's going to stand by while everybody else dies . While his own daughter dies . Don 't you dare touch her . Read the file . I 'll be back . Meteorologists are issuing extreme weather alerts . The temperature is climbing to record highs with little relief in sight . Are you telling me that we just barely escaped one disaster only to be threatened with another ? Yes , Madam President . Except this time it 's not the sun . This time it 's the Earth itself . We confirmed this morning that the deterioration of our magnetosphere is being directly caused by stoppage of the Earth 's core . And without that iron core spinning , the magnetic field around the Earth can 't sustain itself . Dr. Whitlow ... Hologram up . Along with the magnetic field issues . The red sections are warmer plumes rising directly from the Earth 's core causing a global heatwave . And how will this affect us ? In the next twenty-four hours heat related illnesses will increase a hundred fold . Fire storms , glacial melting and volcanic eruptions will become rampant . We 'll have seven , maybe eight days , until the Earth becomes uninhabitable . We 'll have multiple response scenarios ready within the hour . Are we still in contact with Europe ? Partial . Most countries are still recovering from the solar storm . Well , the rest of the world should know about this . Still no reception ? No . Where 's Karen ? Somewhere out there , looking for her father . What 's going on ? Why don 't you tell me ? So you could do what , Jack ? Go and find her ' ? Bring her safely home ? Pretend that your step-daughter means something to you ? Hey ! Don 't say that . You know I love Karen . Then why did you leave her ? I didn 't leave her ! We couldn 't find her . You made a choice , Jack . You left Karen to die . You left my father to die . Beverly , you were unconscious . You needed medical attention . No ! I needed to get yourself to Haven . Karen means everything to me . She is my flesh and blood . She is , she is my baby . How could you do that to them ' ? How could you ' ? Seven more hours to Virginia . I hope Dr. Whitlow knows what she 's doing . She gave us the key card . I trust her . It 's the Secretary of Defense I 'm worried about . You think he 's behind my dad 's disappearance ? When we were in the HFD facility , it was pretty obvious he hates your father . Dad was always so busy . When I was twelve he finally found the time to take us camping . Turns out it was a trip to Alaska to collect data on the Aurora Borealis . Mom was so mad . It was more like a science expedition than a vacation . I bet he put you to work . Yeah , that 's my dad . Instead of Barbies for my birthday I think he figured if I was busy enough , it 'd keep me out of trouble . I always managed to freak him out , though . On that camping trip , I climbed a tree trying to get this photo of the Aurora Borealis over the valley . Ten feet off the ground and he treats it like I 'm dangling over the edge of a live volcano . After three nights of everyone getting on each other 's nerves , we finally saw this amazingly intense display . It was cool , but it wasn 't like this . Look out ! Hang on ! Step on it , Karen ! I am stepping on it ! Dr. Jane Whitlow , I 'm here to retrieve the information Dr. Ranger prepared for the Defense Secretary . I 'm sorry , ma 'am . We can 't do that without authorization . Do you see the likeness ? Yes , ma 'am . Do you see the security code clearance ? Yes , ma 'am . Open the door , soldier . I 'm losing my patience . Oh , my God , Michael . What happened ? Courtesy of the Department of Defense . Brian did this ? He 's out of control . Listen , where am I ? Beneath the Pentagon . I 'm going to get you out of here . Yeah , well , good luck with that . Listen , I think I found a way to reboot the Earth 's core . Zapolyarniy , Russia . The Kola Super Deep Borehole . The race to the center of the earth . Exactly . In 1994 the Russians stopped drilling at 12 thousand meters because it was too hot to proceed . Exactly . But was it ' ? They went further ? It 's the deepest man-made hole on Earth . If we could stick a nuclear bomb and the bottom of that hole , the electromagnetic pulse could kick-start the core . - How big a blast ? - A big one . - Have you ever heard of an MK80 ? - No . Well , it 's the world 's largest nuclear bomb . It 's never been tested , for obvious reasons . Are you sure this is going to work ? Right now , it 's all I got . Thank you . Jane , thank me when it works . I 'm ready to leave . Madam President , you have not been in office for more than twenty-four hours and already you are placing strain on our relationship with your demands . What I am asking for Mr. President , is simply your cooperation . There will be no cooperation . Detonating what you admit is the world 's most powerful nuclear weapon on Russian soil is not going to happen . The detonation will happen at the bottom of the Kola Super-Deep Borehole , Mr. President . Russian lives will not be in danger . So you say . I still have no proof that this will fix the core problem . Let me be clear , Mr. President , while we argue the world is dying . Every option must be explored , every attempt must be made . And that includes sending the MK80 down the Kola Borehole . This will be done with or without your support , Mr. President . You have five minutes to respond . You better be right about this . I 'm worried about Karen , Dad . I still can 't get through to her . She 's with Tim . She 's fine . It 's the second time she 's taken off to find him . It always happens . Michael sticks his neck out not realizing he 's sticking her neck out too . She adores him . Yeah , I know . At least I know Michael would do whatever it takes to protect us . So would Jack . I don 't know , Dad . Not after Operation Haven . The heat ! She passed out . Dad ! Help here ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Edna . Edna , easy , easy , easy . Easy now . It 's okay . Okay . In you go . Let 's get her to the couch . Okay . Okay . Here we go . I 've got her . Blood Got her , Dad ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Down she goes . All right ? I 'll get water and the first aid kit . Jesus , Geoffrey okay . All right . Over here , over here . Sit yourself down . Okay - Okay - Didn 't know where else to go , Governor . Oh , you came to the right place . Please , call me William . Madam President . Vice President Maxwell . We 're ready for you . Have the Russians been cooperative ? Very . Excellent diplomacy skills , I must say . The Russians have just launched the cruise missile . Tens seconds to impact . Five . Four , three , two , one . Dr. Whitlow , did it work ? No change in the core . The borehole wasn 't deep enough . Due to the overheating core , sixty-four percent of the planet is all ready at Death Valley temperatures . We 're at a Category 8 threat level . If it doesn 't start spinning in the next two to three days , the planet will be torn apart by the building pressure . With all due respect , there are several top scientists who disagree with Dr. Whitlow 's assessments . Both the time-line and this theoretical pressure build-up . What ? This is the first time I hear about this . Because you 're not in the loop . I 'm sorry , Madam President , but this entire presentation is premature . Brian , you can 't deny what 's happening out there . We need consensus and we need it now . You don 't think we should go public ? Absolutely not ! Look , look what happened with the CME . The more we kept that thing under wraps , the more infrastructure we were able to maintain . We cannot implement a prevention scenario in the middle of a global panic ! The problem is , we do not have another prevention scenario . Madam President , the video conference with NATO is in five minutes . Thank you . Madam ... Madam President we are working with the brain trusts of China , the UK and Canada . There will be options . We only need one , Brian . One that works . We can 't have anymore mistakes . We need to talk . I visited Michael in his cell , Brian . You weren 't authorized . He 's been beaten . He 's a rogue . He 's dangerous , Jane ! But I admit that his research could be useful . Of course it 's useful ! He 's a brilliant scientist who could be working alongside the smartest minds in the country . You have to stop this ! Perhaps I made this personal . Yeah . That 's exactly what you did . Release him , Brian . Latest sonograms are in . What 's the pressure around the core ? About 450 gigapascals . It 's exactly what we estimated . Distribute this immediately . Dr.Whitlow ? How can I help you ? I have orders to escort you from this facility . Your services are no longer required . Excuse me ? ! There must be some mistake . No , ma 'am . These orders came straight from the Pentagon . Of course they did . What 's going on ? I stepped on the wrong toes . Peter , you 're in charge now . Continue with our work . But what about you ? I 'm not giving up . Damn it ! Are you sure this is where she said ? Yeah . This is it . Still no signal . The lightning is getting worse . It 's the electrical build-up from the deteriorating magnetosphere . You made good time . Had a good reason . You said you know where my father is . Michael 's being kept in a holding cell in at the Pentagon . Secretary of Defense . Yeah . So , how do we get him out ? I 'm going to forge a release order from the White House . Back up a minute , Dr. Whitlow . We 're going to bust Dr. Ranger out of the Pentagon ? ! Yeah . That 's exactly what we 're going to do . Come on . Release order for Dr. Ranger . One moment , please . Excuse me , who are you calling ? My supervisor . That 's not necessary . It 'll just take a moment , ma 'am . I 'm calling to confirm a release order for Dr. Ranger . Don 't move ! You won 't get away with this . If we don 't , we 're all going to die soon anyhow . Key card . Karen ! Dad ! Are you okay ? What are you guys doing here ? We 're getting you out of here . The research , grab what you can . Let 's go ! Come on . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Run ! Freeze ! Drop it ! Now ! Good . Now kick it over to me . Looks like we 've got ourselves a little jail break . Please , you have to let us go . There 's too much at stake . She 's right . Afterall , we 're talking about saving the human race . It 's not my call . I 'm going to need you to follow . Dad ! Thanks for busting me out of there . I couldn 't leave you . Why 'd you do it , Jane ? After I left , why did you rebuild our HFD program with him ' ? Truth ? I sold out . You were manipulated . No . No , I was selfish . Brian offered me my own program . Fifty times the budget . No more working off my laptop . No more waiting for government hand-outs . I convinced myself that building Brian 's weapon was better than building nothing . Well , there 's still time to change your path . Yeah . But the path I chose cost me my partner . And my friend . I 'm so sorry , Michael . I 'm sorry for everything . Where 're we going , anyway ? My grandfather 's cabin . They won 't find us . Pause it . Find them , Carver . No mistakes . This is really starting to scare the crap out of me . Dad , what 's causing this ? When the CME hit it overloaded the Earth 's magnetic field with ionized particles . And that caused the Earth 's core to stall . That 's really bad , isn 't it ? Yeah . Cause it 's not sustaining the magnetosphere anymore . What 's a magnetosphere ? It means it 's going to get hot really fast . The earth 's going to start opening up . Volcanic eruptions , boiling oceans the end of life as we know it . Thanks for painting such a rosy picture . That 's why we have to re-start the core . Come on , let 's get to work . There 's a bed upstairs Karen I can share . That works for me . Tim I will bunk down here . Won 't we , Tim ? - Yes , sir . - Yeah . There 's a generator in the storage beside the driveway . Okay . Well , Tim and I will get it started . No , wait ... This is nicely familiar . Yes , it is . Well , we should get to work . - Yes , we should . - Yeah ... I hope my mom 's okay . I wish I could call her . I 'm sure she 's fine . Nothing 's fine , Tim . The human race could be extinct in a few days . I can 't even comprehend that . We 're talking about our entire existence . Unless my dad and Dr. Whitlow come up with a master plan , it all ends . Don 't say that . But it 's the truth . No more dysfunctional family dinners . Or star gazing off your roof , or road trips , or just dreaming of a future with you . It 's over . We 're done . Listen , this is a nightmare , but we 're together . I 'm with my fiance . If the world were to end right now , there 's no place I 'd rather be . What do you think 's keeping them so long ? - Maybe I should ... - No ... you shouldn 't . Well , what would you do ? Nothing . Are you having trouble letting go ? It 's just that when she was born she had a high fever . Before I could even hold her they took her to the ICU . And for a week all I could do was stare at my baby through a sheet of glass . When they finally let me hold her , I looked at her big beautiful eyes and I swore to myself that I would never let anything happen to her again . You know she 'll always be your daughter . Yeah ... that doesn 't make it any easier . Due to the Earth 's damaged magnetosphere , cell phone , internet and power disruptions , along with the global Aurora Borealis will continue over the coming days . There is still no official explanation for the mysterious heatwave that has resulted in thousands of deaths across the US . The nation-wide state of emergency continues as temperatures reach a staggering 122 degrees Fahrenheit , 50 degrees Celsius . Countries world-wide are also reporting massive causalities as temperatures continue . On the ground ! On the ground ! Do it ! Now ! Who are you ? Bev , just don 't talk . These four fugitives are suspected terrorists . Have you seen them ' ? Oh my , God . Karen ... Have you seen them ! Hey , we 're American civilians ! Get that gun out of my wife 's face ! Jack ! Easy ! Easy ! Listen to me ! We haven 't seen Karen and Tim since this morning . They went looking for Michael . Sir , if you are caught harboring or aiding these fugitives in anyway , you will be prosecuted . Do you understand that ? Yes . Sweep the area . Go guys . Vibration . - Vibration ? - Vibration . - The Earth 's core is nickel and iron alloy . - Yeah . One high frequency pulse targeted at the core would create ripples that would vibrate through the nickel and iron , creating a chain reaction until , until the whole core is vibrating with energy . A high frequency pulse that would jump start the Earth 's core . Exactly . We just need an EHF pulse that matches the core 's resonant frequency . I have an HFD prototype . You have a prototype ? ! When I realized the DOD was taking over our program I made copies of all our research . You continued with our work ? Of course I did . I didn 't become a scientist because I wanted to build weapons . I wanted to do things for the betterment of humanity . So did you . Yeah . I miss working with you , Michael . I miss working with you , Jane . You stayed true to yourself . Yeah . A lot of good that 's done me . We should work . Yeah . The answer may be the replication of the Coronal Mass Ejection impact on the magnetosphere . A shock stopped the Earth 's core , it 's conceivable an identical shock could start it . How ? We calculated the necessary blast . It requires simultaneous detonation of forty neutron bombs in the magnetosphere . What about the fallout ? Significant . Both from neutron activation and from the fission primaries in the missiles themselves . Begin your simulations immediately . Sir , Dr. Whitlow has accessed the SRAS system using her old access key . We 've tracked her to a remote forest location in West Virginia . Send in your best team . Carver ... shoot to kill . Yes , sir . Dad was right . There 's geothermal activity under this lake . What does that mean exactly ? My best guess , gases are leaking up from the fault line and super heating the water . That was a guess ? That was my first term paper on lake formation . Jane and Dad need to see this . Wait . Do you hear that ? Come on . Let 's go . Soldiers ! We gotta move ! - How many ? - We saw four up on the main road . Hold ! This feels like an earthquake . Jane " . Jane . She 's breathing . Outside . Quickly . Get in the car ! Hundreds have been reported dead from the Iron Wood Mountain eruption which has destroyed much of Monterey , Virginia . In Japan , Italy and Mexico , there have been dozens of volcanic eruptions . The death tolls are in the tens of thousands . Exactly what Dr. Whitlow predicted . Pressure build up from the core . Where is she ' ? Why isn 't she here ? She 's feared among the dead on Monterey . Madam President ? And what are we hearing from the Chinese Academy of Sciences ? Nothing solid . And Russia ? Same . But our scientists are working on a possible solution to restarting the core . It involves fortifying the atmosphere with neutron detonations . I want to see a report as soon as possible . Dr. Whitlow estimated that we would have between two , possibly three days to solve this ... And I believe her . Everyone 's dismissed . Thank you , Madam . Thank you , Madam . Brian , what um , what was Dr. Whitlow doing in southwest Virginia ? Visiting a family cabin . She needed a break . The world 's falling apart and she takes a break ? Frankly ma 'am , she was falling apart . She blamed herself for this crisis . You don 't seem too upset . Excuse me ? Well , you and Dr. Whitlow have been working together for quite sometime . She might be dead and that doesn 't bother you . I would never let my personal grief interfere with my duty to this country . Indeed . Don 't let me keep you . Do you believe him ? I wish I could , Madam President . I know . Here we are in the middle of a global crisis and we have a Secretary of Defense who cannot be trusted . It could be the pressure cap . If it 's leaking , that would explain the cooling system malfunction light . Aren 't you a little car mechanic . Get me a water bottle out of the trunk . Oh , and duct tape from the tool bag . Don 't move . Cw ! A volcanic ash plume continues to grow above Iron Wood Mountain after a devastating volcanic eruption . Communities within a hundred mile radius are advised to evacuate immediately . Repeat , communities within a hundred mile radius of Iron Wood are advised ... Those soldiers ... I think they were Black Ops . They must have tracked us when we used my old access card . So no more SRAS . How 's the engine ? We 'll get a few more miles . Don 't push it though . Let 's go . Bev ' ? Hon ? What are you doing out here ? It 's too hot . I couldn 't take being inside anymore . It felt like the walls were closing in on me . Your mother loved this view . She used to come here when she needed to think . I do too . Dad , Karen is out there . I know . And she 's coming home . Any moment now , her and Michael and Tim will drive up . Preferably with some new high-tech cooling contraption . Everyone will be safe under one roof . Do you really think so , Dad ' ? I do . And you and Jack , you two will work it out . He had to make a tough decision . Come on back inside . Hm ? I could use your help . Let 's just ... let 's just stay out a little longer . Okay ? Okay - One , two , three , go ... Thanks . Guys , I want you to drink this water . All right ' ? Thank you . How 's Edna ? She 's going to be okay . Jack 's taking good care of her . I have been worried sick about you ! Where have you been ? Dad was kidnapped by the Defense Secretary . What ? ! We broke him out of the Pentagon . You broke him out ' ? Listen , you can 't stay . They 're looking for you . Soldiers were already here . I 'm not staying . I 'm just picking up some supplies . Yeah . We just needed to know you were okay . Okay - I think we should all hear this . A giant fissure , ten miles long and hundreds of miles deep has opened outside of Springfield , Massachusetts . This is the latest in a recent global epidemic of heatwaves , earthquakes and volcanic eruption . Although there 's been no official government statement , the scientific community has linked this growing disaster to the CME strike of three days ago . There is a growing speculation that the strike stalled the Earth 's core . And these disasters will worsen over the coming days . World panic ... According to my predictions , it 's not a matter of days . We have less than twenty-four hours . Til what ? Til the heat and the pressure build-up tear apart the planet . Here comes another one . Looting and violence is rampant in all urban centers . With compromised communications and nation-wide blackouts , there is no clear death toll . But observers speculate it may be in the hundreds of thousands . I think the fissure in Springfield could work . Is it deep enough ? It could be , if I build the right delivery system . I 'm trying to wrap my head around this . You 're going to send a frequency pulse to the center of the earth using your HFD thingy ? That 's right . A frequency pulse that matches the resonance of the earth 's core . You lost me . The same way an opera signer can shatter a wine glass with a high note . When the pulse hits the surface of the core , the same kind of thing will happen . There will be a vibration , big enough to jump-start the core . Does your prototype actually work ? Basically . Basically ? Well , it needs a few adjustments . But we 're still going to have to figure out how to get it to Springfield . I know a place you can get a flatbed truck . As a reminder , you 're all fugitives . Can I get a pen , paper and envelope ? Yeah . You have a White House clearance , right ? Yeah . Okay - You 're going to hand deliver this to the President . Are you kidding me ' ? No . She needs to know we have a plan to start the core . Jack , you need to do this . Okay - I 'll do what I can , but how am I going to get there in time ? It 's an eight hour drive . I could pull a few strings . I 've got a friend who owns a Cessna . What about the Black Ops ? They 're still after us . I got an idea . SRAS is back on-line . We 're locked . Let 's go . There is only a 13 % chance that this will work , Brian . And the nuclear fallout will wipe out half the population of the United States I think I know the circumstances . This is an acceptable risk . Killing a hundred and fifty million people is not acceptable under any circumstances . We need more options . There are no more options , Alice ! Look , we can 't save everybody . Sometimes people have to die for the greater good . This is one of those times . No . No . I do not believe that ! I will not give up . And wait for what ? ! Wait for time to run out and then everybody dies ! You 're gambling with the fate of the entire planet ! Dr. Whitlow said we had two to three days before things became irreversible ! And if she is wrong , then we would have stood by and done nothing ! You have to make a decision right now ! I just did ! We 're not doing it . Dad ! Where 're you going ? I 'm leaving . And ... you 're not coming with me . What do you mean , I 'm not coming ? I want you to stay here with your mother . She 's safe here . You need me . It 's too dangerous . I , I could never live with myself if something happened to you . You 'd still be locked up if it wasn 't for me . The world 's at stake and you can 't do it alone . You can 't protect me for ever . Yes . I can . I know you love me . And I know you 'll always be there for me , but if you fail , there will be no more world to live in . Please , Dad . Get out of the car ! Hands up where I can see ' em . Step aside . Step aside ! She 's a decoy . Global reports of volcanic eruptions and heatwaves continue to grow along with civil unrest in all urban centers . We will keep ... We lost the signal . I think I prefer not hearing it . How much further to the truck depot ? Another five minutes . This is real bad . And it 's only going to get worse . Michael ... I see it . Now ! It 's a trap ! Get out of the car ! Come on . Give me that ! Open the door ! Go around the other side ! Open that door ! Hey ! ' She 's got a gun ! - Got a gun ! Back up ! Let 's get out of here ! Get in the car . The global temperature is rising 50 % faster than we previously estimated . But it may not be the heat that kills us . The pressure from the stalled core ... It keeps building . Since this morning There 've been three hundred and forty-five new volcanic eruptions . Fissures are now being reported on every continent . The earth is breaking apart . How long do we have ? Well , the reports are conflicting . I mean , it 's impossible to say . Well , unless there 's a miracle , we 're going to have to implement Brian 's plan . I 'll make that call within the hour . Miracles do happen . Yes , they do , but I 'd rather the fate of the world didn 't hang on that possibility . Let 's use the crane to get that satellite dish off . How much time do you think the decoys bought us ? Not much . Let 's get busy . Wow . You actually do work here . Yeah . I enjoy the privacy . It works . It just needs a little love . You can access the high frequency generator from here . Okay - You think he could have found a easier place to mount this . Michael ! What the hell was that ? ! It 's a build-up of steam pressure . The aquifers beneath out feet are heating up . If it 's happening here , it 's happening everywhere . All right . Let 's get back to work . We 've got a lot to do . This is Secretary of Defense . ID 5443275 . Launch Operation Phoenix . Sir , this wing is off limits . Listen to me , it 's of the utmost importance that this letter is given to the President . The survival of the planet depends on it . I 'm sorry , sir . All correspondence must go through the appropriate channels . There 's no time . She has to read this . I understand that , but the fact remains ... Just take me to the President ! Sir ! We need to escort you from the facility . Okay . I 'm sorry . I 'll contact her office . - Halt ! - Madam President ! Hold it right there ! I have a letter from Dr. Jane Whitlow ! She knows how to restart the core ! I want to hear what he has to say . Dr. Whitlow is dead . What are you talking about ? She 's alive , Madam President . Please , read the letter . Let him go . And get me the Secretary of Defense immediately ! Thank you . Okay . EHF pulse is calibrated . How 're those polarity condensers ? I 've got it set at 75 % , but that 's when the system overloads . No . You 're holding it too long . For comparable polarity condensers , patch a pulse directly into the wave harmonizer . That 's a great idea . Alright . I think that any other adjustments we can make at the fissure . Yeah . Everyone out of the house ! Are we still on track , Dr. Winters ? It 's risky . The latest simulation calculated less than 6 % success rate . Will the President be joining us for the launch ? Sorry , Dr. , but we 're on our own . Seal the bunker , please . Mr. Secretary , we may have a possible lead . So what do you think ? It 's pretty damn deep . Don 't get too close . It seems pretty solid . Until the next tremor . Hey , do you have to do that ? Considering we 're going to park a flatbed truck next to it , yes . Okay . Come on . We only have a couple of hours . Geoffrey ? Over here . Dad . Geoffrey . Oh , how bad ? Feels like my ribs are broken . Oh , God . Let 's get this off him . Okay - Careful there . Okay - All right . Okay , Geoffrey . Let 's have a look . Beverly , go get the first aid kit . Okay - Thanks ... Governor . You 're welcome . The bunker 's in full lock-down . There 's no way in . He 's gone rogue . He 's going to try the neutron strike on our magnetosphere . But he can 't . He doesn 't have control of Missile Command . Contact General Stinson immediately . General , key in authentication code Alpha ... 4335358 . Thank you , General . You 've done your country a great service today . Done . In ten minutes we launch a wave of neutron missiles . Mr. Secretary , has the President authorized this ? Let me make my position perfectly clear to you . Dr. Winters , I 'm the Secretary of Defense . I have a sworn duty to protect and defend the United States of America . We 're on the brink of global annihilation with a president who can 't make the right decisions . She gave me no choice . All right , take it up ! You 're almost there ! We 're fully extended . You know , we 're only going to get one shot at this . Two minutes to impulse release ! Sir , all launch sites are now on-line . Awaiting your order . Proceed with the launch . They found us ! Forty-five seconds ! Hold them off , Tim ! I 'm trying ! Thirty seconds ! Everybody down ! Down on the ground ! Yeah , floor ! - Get down ! - Let 's go ! Move ! Secure ! It 's malfunctioning ! The pulse hasn 't released . - Michael ! - Dad ! I 'm okay . Listen , you need to connect the power relay to release the pulse . Okay - Get it right or you 'll fry the whole machine . Remember the connections are color-coded . Make sure it 's still powering up . Okay - Karen ! Watch out ! It 's starting to overload ! Hurry ! It 's powered up , do it , now ! What 's the status ? Three seconds to pulse ! We 're back on-line ! Get off of me ! Get off of me ! Get off ! I 'm doing the right thing here ! - Status ? - Get off ! Status ! Um ... thirty seconds to launch . We are patched straight into Missile Command . Type in this abort code ! 054-523-87 . Damn it , Alice ! Let it launch ! Launch has been aborted . You 've just signed a death warrant for the entire human race . Get him out of here . I just ... I just pray to God it was the right decision . You did . Madam President ? Reports are coming in from China , Russia , Germany ... the Earth 's core . It appears to be spinning again . It 's spinning . She did it . She did it . Dr. Whitlow did it ! Oh , my God ! You hear that ? It 's quiet . And that 's not all . We saved the world today . What a beautiful day . Today marks the end of a global catastrophe . It is a day to be thankful , because it has created a bond that transcends borders , religion and race . We are citizens of humanity and today we have prevailed . Can I get everyone 's attention , please ? I would like to officially announce our engagement . Dr. Ranger , I love your daughter very much . And I promise to be a good husband . Do you , now ? Beverly , what do you think about this engagement ? I think Karen and Tim know exactly what they 're doing . I 'm all for it . Jack ? If he makes Karen happy , that 's all that matters . Governor ? I like the boy . You have anything else to say ? I want to be a police officer , Dr. Ranger . And a good one . I just hope you can see past that and see me for who I really am . Karen ... you have grown up to be a beautiful and remarkable young woman . These past three days , you have definitely proven that you can take care of yourself . It would be my honor to have you as my son-in-law . Thanks , Dad . Well , propose a toast . To Karen and Tim . Cheers . It really is a beautiful world we live in , isn 't it ? Yes . It is . I am so honored to have met you , Michael . And eternally grateful for what you and Jane have done . We 're just a couple of scientists , you know . We had nothing to lose . You 're too modest . You overcame incredible odds with unparalleled ingenuity and determination . Yes , I read the report . And Michael , there 's a senior position open for you . To help run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Your expertise on climate change would be greatly appreciated . Thank you , Madam President . It 's the least we could do . See you soon . See you soon . I thought you were going to ask for a new barn , or a new truck . I should have asked for a new barn . Or that flatbed truck . I really liked that flatbed truck . Anything else you forgot ? Mmm ... I could have asked for a boat . We could go fishing . Do you like fishing ? No . How about a house ? You know , to get you out of that trailer . I like my trailer . Really ? Really . I have everything I need . Right here .

 The producers would like to thank the families of the missing persons for making this film possible . On November 26 , 2011 , a film crew was reported missing in northern Sweden . After 10 days , the Swedish police called off the search . A year later , the Swedish Intelligence Service was hacked by " Anonymous " . Soon after , an unknown source published the data from the crew 's laptop online . This is the crew 's footage . Sweden , 320 miles north of Copenhagen . Friday , November 18 , 2011 . 11 : 16 AM . - You 're making a mess . - What are you looking for ? I 'm looking for a pen . Why are you filming this ? It 's " Behind the Scenes " . Alex , grab the other camera . - Then give it to me . - It 's in the back . Here we go . Hey , how 's it going up front ? In " Behind the Scenes " you ask people how the movie was made , but we haven 't started yet . Shut up , Anders . We 're doing " Behind the Scenes " . Janne , let 's do it . - Say something . - Say something ? - Talk about your first horse . - My first horse ? - I mean talk about yourself . - What do you want to know ? Oh , come on ... Well , I 'm an actress and ... - We 're almost out of licorice . - I 've done commercials ... - We have lots more . - Are you even interested ? - Yes , go on . - No one wants to hear that shit . You 've done commercials . How old are you ? Where did you train ? - Your turn then . - I 'm Alex . I 'm 27 and I 'm an actor . - What 's this Oprah crap ? - Copenhagen , Denmark . Perfect ! Copenhagen , Denmark . She 's mad because she didn 't get to talk about her ballet school . Can you stretch your leg all the way up ? - I 'm not saying anything . - But you just did . - The silent treatment . - Anders ? It 's you . - Yes . What 's me ? - Yes , exactly . What are you ? - You should film him . - I 'm the director of the film . How old are you ? Yes , that 's the only relevant question right now . You 're ridiculous . Give me that thing . It 's your turn now . - Three , two , go ! - What am I doing ? Just say what I just said . How old are you ? I 'm the director and I 'm 35 . That 's what you said ! Okay , Superman , What 's your job ? Cameraman and editor . Look . I want to show you something on the iPad . - Yes , that 's nice . - It 's the film 's logo . No way . It took two minutes to make . It 's nice how the " O " is bigger than the others . - Anders , it should be a sci-fi . - No , it 's a horror film . Mikael , put on some music . Track number nine . I need the bathroom soon . That licorice runs right through me . This track is so awesome . - Is it yours ? - Yes , it 's for the film . - It 's Mikael 's and mine . - You made it ? It sounds good . - Can you do ballet to that , Janne ? - Easily . When do we get to a restaurant ? Aren 't you hungry ? I 'm starving . I 'll go into a coma if I don 't eat soon . This fish is really dry . - What do you think of my steady cam ? - It looks very steady . Here , take it . You want " Behind the Scenes " to be awesome , don 't you ? No , I 'm eating right now . Where the hell did you get that steady cam ? - I bought it . - You bought it ? - Well , technically you bought it . - How many cameras did you buy ? - Three . - Are you serious ? Three cameras and a steady cam ... Do you think I have gold up my ass ? - What were you thinking ? - You told me to get proper equipment . Are you going to come by and film me when I get evicted too ? - Shut up . - How does it work ? These weights provide balance so it can be moved smoothly . Stanley Kubrick uses them . The balance is still off , jerkwad . - It 's your balance that 's off . - Can I try ? You 're good at that , Janne . Maybe you should be " camera ass " . - You 're so lame . - That 's what it 's called . " Camera ass " ? What 's your favorite horror film , Fjord ? - Let 's guess . - It starts with an " A " . - It 's Alien . - Alien is sci-fi . - You can zoom too . - Yes , I got it . What if you had to choose a horror movie that wasn 't made in the 80s ? I don 't want to . It 's all crappy action nowadays . There has to be something . The Blair Witch Project ? Blair Witch ? I like the idea , but not the execution . What idea is that ? The director tried to scare the actors , but it didn 't work . I just want to apologize ... I 'm so scared . - You 're spitting on the camera . - Relax . Take it then . - Have you seen Blair Witch ? - No , I haven 't . - Can I interview you ? - God damn it , Fjord . - What 's your favorite horror film ? - We can 't use it . Hey , relax ! You 're the one who got me that shrimp salad burger . We were just talking about movies . About The Blair Witch Project ! They 'll figure it out ! No , they won 't . - What 's up , girls ? - Hey , Fjord . Where are the others ? - Janne is still in there . - I need the bathroom . Anders ? Take a look . - Did you make another poop film ? - Just look . Alex and Janne borrowed the camera to rehearse the scene . Oh , Alex ... Alex ... Oh , come on . - It 's not funny , Fjord ! - Why not ? - It goes on for five minutes . - Fetch the others . - Is it a problem ? - I don 't know . " Encounters " . It sounds like a sci-fi . But it 's not . It 's horror . It should be called " Invaders " . Like " Space Invaders " ? " Invaders of the Sixth Kind " . That means you interact with aliens and then they kill you . Some people believe there 's also a Seventh Kind . That 's when you interact with aliens and then give birth to their offspring . - So you fuck an alien ? - You fornicate with one . - " Alien Fornication " . - Maybe we should call the film that . It 's not my fault I have a tiny bladder . - Do you know where we are , Anders ? - I don 't have service . Me neither . I just have one tiny bar . Yes , we saw that in the home video you left on the camera . A tiny bar . Calm down , man . - You 're not serious . - It 's ready for YouPorn . Go take a piss , Superman . We can 't have your willie in " Behind the Scenes " . I 'm sorry , Janne . I 'm sorry . No one was supposed to see it . - Would you close the door ? - Sure . Oh , shit ! Wait ! Come on , man ! Wait ! Stop , stop , stop ... Let him catch up to us . And go . - Are you going to erase it then ? - Yes , I will . Hold this so I can get my pants on . - Oh , dude . - Very funny . - Why are we going all the way up here ? - Come on , Mikael , don 't do that . Are we almost there ? Alex , can I borrow your phone ? I promised to text my mom . Aww , you 're texting mom . - Chill out , Sarah Linden . - Did you want to borrow it or not ? Mireille Enos wants her woolen sweater back . - The GPS isn 't working . - What are you talking about ? Look , it 's flickering . We should be there now . No , it said we 'd arrive in 10 minutes . - Did you break the GPS ? - Chill out , man . What the hell ? - Oh , sorry to wake you up . - Were you sleeping ? - What 's going on ? - Why are we stopping ? - There 's some guy on the road . - Wait , don 't move . - He 's not moving . - Man , he 's creepy . Drive around . Why is he just standing there ? - Get him on film ! - Are you okay ? Are you alone ? Zoom in on him . He 's Swedish , he doesn 't know what 's going on . Alex , don 't leave the car . - There 's something wrong with him . - Just stay in the car . - He 's super creepy . - Just drive around . He 's a scary motherfucker . Fuck , he 's scary . You got him , right ? He has to be in the film . He must have been drunk . Oh , man ... Are you all right , Janne ? I feel bad about just driving away . We had to get away from there . He made his way out there , so he can find his way home too . He 's one of those hermits who lives in the woods and eats his own feces . Bye ! - When will they be back ? - In three days . - Anders , it 's getting dark already . - That 's why we have to get going . Wait for me , wait for me . I 'm guessing that the lake is here ... Over there . I just can 't see shit . - Is this it ? - Yes . - Are you lost ? - No . We 're just looking at the map . Hand me the GPS . There 's nothing there . - Get it out , Fjord . - Get what out ? - Come on , it 's on your list . - No , wait a second ... - Fjord , I 'm not in the mood . - Hold on . My list said cameras , batteries , maps ... - Did you forget it ? - No , because it wasn 't mine to bring . You fucking forgot the GPS . What 's wrong with you , Fjord ? Huh ? What the hell are you doing ? Do you know where we are ? We 're 120 miles into the Swedish woods . - We 'll get lost without that GPS . - Relax ! I can 't believe this . - Does anyone have a GPS phone ? - Calm down , I have GPS on my phone . Here , Anders . Take the map . Just a moment . It can 't download the map . - They don 't work without internet . - That 's why we needed the other one . Okay , listen . Be quiet . We 'll set up a camp here . We 'll look at the map again tomorrow . - Anders , do you know where we 're going ? - Yes . - Great . - There was no GPS on my list . - Ow ! - Just hold on . Don 't worry , Anders , we 're saved . Janne has the map . It 's perfect . But seriously , we 're 370 miles into Sweden and we 've walked 10 miles . - That 's pretty accurate . - We 'll find it tomorrow . We 'll find the location with the lake and start filming . - What are you doing ? - I 'm getting the whiskey . No way . We 're lost , we can 't have you running around drunk in the woods . - Just give me a little bit . - No , you 're not getting any . - Anders ? - Shut up , man . Anders ? Anders , do you hear that ? Anders ? Did you hear that noise ? No . Fjord 's scary noises : Take one . Okay , Fjord . What did you hear ? - I don 't know . - He can 't hear anything . - You 're chewing really loudly . - Is that it ? - Maybe it was a moose . - No , this is how a moose sounds . - What does a goat sound like ? - Well , they ... . You guys are idiots . No , I don 't want any of that . Janne , you should interview Anders . Like we talked about in the restaurant . - Anders ? How about an interview ? - Not a chance . So , Anders ... So , why do we have to go so far north to shoot these scenes ? - I don 't want to do this . - Sit down , I can 't film you ! - No , I 'm done . We have to get going . - Why did we have to come here ? Let 's just go . I can 't find the scary stuff . - It 's in the Encounters folder . - No , I checked . Anders ? I still need more nature shots . - You have two minutes . - Three ! No , it takes 20 . - Two minutes . - We need them for editing . You can pack my things for me . Hello there ... That 's a good nature shot . Turn around . Turn around for Daddy . You 're so cute when you 're washing yourself . Oh yes ... No , lose the towel . What are you doing , you pig ? Are you filming her ? - No , I 'm just getting some footage . - Weren 't you getting beauty shots ? - I have a beauty shot right here . - Get to work . All right . I 'll be right back . Are you shooting ? Oh no , I 'm just doing some frame tests . I was wondering , if it hadn 't been Alex could something have happened between you and me instead ? - Maybe . - Maybe ? - If you weren 't so annoying . - I 'm not annoying ! Are you and Alex going to have kids ? I don 't know . - Where are Anders and Alex ? - They 're talking about the scene . I want to talk about it too . Look , you can 't be with Janne . It 's just going to fuck everything up . No , it 'll create more drama . No , I 'm worried about her . She 's so fragile . - And you know what to do ? - Yes , I 've got this . - Stick to the plan . - Of course . - What the hell are you doing , Fjord ? - Huh ? - What are you doing ? - I needed the bathroom . Are you pooping right now ? That 's fucking disgusting . Go shoot your film somewhere else . I 'll just go poop somewhere else . Shit ... Anders , does Sweden share a border with Alaska ? - It 's just a shower ; it 'll pass . - Come on , Fjord . Anders , there 's a lake right here ! Listen ... Anders spent two months planning and finding the perfect lake for this . There are mushrooms here . - Come on ! - There are mushrooms ! Let 's go , Fjord ! - That lake ... - This map sucks . I give up . - I can 't figure it out . - Hey , stop it . I 'm exhausted . Can 't we take a break and get warm ? Let 's go hide in a tent . - A tent won 't be much warmer . - Let 's keep going . - We 're getting soaked . - It 's better to keep moving . Are you loving it , Janne ? Anders , this is the same fucking lake . - It 's the same lake . - We 'll film here . What ? When we left , you thought filming here was the worst idea ever . - Now suddenly it 's a great idea ? - I can 't find the lake without a GPS . All right , let 's have the GPS-talk again . The light looks good . Let 's do it here . As long as I get to sit down . Ice crystals ! Freeze ! - What did you correct ? - It 's just a few changes . It 's going to be great . Perfect . Here are the costumes . They look expensive . Well , it 's a low-budget film . - Do you want cameras in the trees ? - Don 't put cameras in the trees . Just focus on what I asked you to do . We don 't need any of that . - Focus on your job . - How much did you want to keep ? Some of it seems a bit far-fetched . I have some ideas I 'd like to share . Anders , let 's rehearse the new scenes before we lose the light . - Anders ? - We don 't have time to rehearse . But we need to do the corrected scenes . - Camera is rolling . - Action . - I know he is out there . - Dearest Maria , there is nothing . I can feel it . We are lost . It is too late . It is all in your head . I sense that you know I am right . This was no coincidence . Just calm down . We cannot sleep , he will kill us in our dreams . - Janne ... - Maria . - I 'm sorry . - Just keep going . - Isn 't that Nightmare on Elm Street ? - Shut up , Fjord . - What is this ? - If you read it , you will die . You must get another person to read it , so they die instead of you . How on earth did a letter get into the woods ? - With the postal service . - Shut up . Ridiculous . Listen . - It is just our dog . - That is not our dog . It is a dog from hell . Action . - Do you know how heavy this is ? - Right . Let 's go . Let 's get to the zombie dog . You say that it 's our dog . I 'm waiting for your line . I can 't go if you don 't say that it 's our dog . Alex , please ... - What 's going on ? - What the fuck is that ? - Could it be headlights ? - There aren 't any roads here . - There aren 't any cars here . - That 's freaky . - Give me the camera . - What are you doing ? - I want to film it . - What do you think I 'm doing ? Hello ? Come on , Fjord . Alex , wait . I have to get the steady cam off . Oh , shit ... Ouch ! - What the hell is it ? - Can you see it ? I can 't see shit . But that light is moving around . Alex ? Damn it , Alex . Hello ? Hello ? - What 's going on ? - Alex ? Point the beam over there . What are you doing ? What was with that light ? Alex and Anders are just fucking with us . Oh , it 's so dangerous . The only clue is his shoe . I heard Anders and Alex talking about Blair Witch . - What are you talking about ? - Why would they do that ? Because they want some real reaction shots for their little movie . How could I shine those lights from here ? It 's not that hard to shine a light . It was moving , you idiot ! I had nothing to do with it ! - Then why did I only find his shoe ? - I don 't know ! - Can 't we call him ? - Yes . - Does anyone have service ? - I had one bar before . It 's ringing . I can 't hear anything . Put it on speaker phone . - Hello ? - Alex ? - Cut it out , Alex . - Alex ? If his phone is ringing somewhere , we can find him . If we split up we can cover a larger area . - All right , stop , stop . - We 'll call him and follow the sound . - We 're not splitting up . - We have walkie-talkies . - I 'm not going back out there . - You 'll have a flashlight . We 'll follow the sound of the phone . If we split up we can cover more ground . We have the walkie-talkies . - This is like a bad horror movie . - Well , what do you want to do ? I want to wait here until he comes back . He might be lost out there . There are bears and wolves and shit . So , he 's injured and his shoe is just lying there ? - Yes , maybe he fell . - Fine , then give me a walkie-talkie . You 're so ridiculous , Fjord . Alex ? Keep calling him . Hey , are you still calling him ? I 'm calling him constantly . Anders , I can 't hear you . - Can you hear anything ? - No . - Anders , stop messing around . - Fuckwad . Hey , are you still calling him ? I 'm calling him constantly . Alex ? - There 's something here . - Say that again . I hear something over here . Did you find him ? It 's his phone . What the hell is going on ? Alex ? He 's not here . Jesus ... I think we should call for help . And have them fly out here because our friend is fucking with us ? - Are you paying the bill ? - Don 't you care ? I 'm done . No one listens to me anyway . Let 's just go to bed . We 'll find him tomorrow . I 'll set up the camera to film the weird lights . - So we 're just going to go to bed ? - What can we do ? Run around in the freezing forest ? We can 't see shit . - It 's Alex . - No , wait . Anders ? No , Janne , don 't . Don 't go out there . - Don 't go out there , Janne . - It 's him , Fjord . Alex , what are you doing ? Anders ! Come out here ! - What 's going on ? - Alex is here . Alex ? Hey ? Hello ? Put him in recovery position ! Anders , is this some kind of joke ? For God 's sake , help me ! Don 't just stand there ! Anders , are you in on this ? What were you two talking about ? Anders , tell the truth right now ! Yes , he was supposed to disappear and shine some lights ! This isn 't part of the plan ! What do you think I am ? - You wanted us to be scared shitless ! - You were supposed to film it ! - How did you know I would film it ? - I know you ! Shut up ! - It 's making strange noises again . - Put it on speaker phone . Hello ? What the hell are those noises ? Hello ? - Janne , there 's no one there . - There must be someone ! And now it 's dead . - Janne , take the camera . - Help me , Fjord . Oh , no ... Are you pregnant ? Maybe it 's something I ate . Go away . I asked you about the mushrooms . I 'm having stomach problems too . - I ate half the pot of soup and I 'm fine . - That 's great , Fjord . Is Alex awake , Janne ? - Is Alex awake ? - He was awake last night . Alex ? Oh ! Alex ? Janne ? You said he was awake . - Yes , he was awake last night . - He 's totally gone . What the fuck did he say ? What did he say when he woke up ? He must have said something . Jesus , that 's disgusting . It 's completely rotten . - How can that happen overnight ? - What are we supposed to eat now ? Anders , he 's shaking ! Do something ! - Was he like that all night ? - No , he was awake ! - What did he say ? - Nothing ! Why the hell are you filming ? He 's throwing up ! He 's going to choke on it ! It fucking stinks . Janne , what did he say ? I heard you moaning all night . He didn 't say anything ! We have to build a stretcher and go get some help . We can 't build a stretcher ! - What should we do then ? - I don 't know ! - Could you check your phones ? - I did , mine 's off . It 's dead . - Let 's try and lift him up . - How do you mean ? - Just pull at his sleeping bag ? - Yes , okay . - He 's falling off . - Let 's try it . - He 's sliding off . - Fuck ! - What ... ? - Anders ... Shit ... What a trip . - What ? - I need to sit down . Let 's get him over here . Come on . - Okay , five minutes . - He can lie down here . - I feel like I 'm hung over . - I 'm exhausted too . - I 'm completely worn out too . - Right . Of course you are , Fjord . Can I have some of that ? I 'm fucking thirsty . - Could you check your phones ? - I 've checked it a million times . Hold this . I 'll show you that they 're not working . - On ... - What ? I 'll be damned . Is yours working too ? Does it have service ? There 's no network . I 'll try again . It doesn 't work . - There 's no service . - Did you try Alex 's phone ? Anders , hand me your phone . What date does it say it is ? Mine says it 's the 24th . - Yes , so what ? - That 's what yours says too . - When did we leave ? - On the 18th . Friday the 18th , and today is the 24th . How could almost a week have gone by ? - Mine says it 's the 24th too . - So we 've been here almost a week . We 've only slept twice . No wonder we 're dehydrated if we 've slept for four days . We haven 't slept for four days . The phones are just off . I know it sounds crazy , but this is a classic sign of aliens . - That 's a load of crap . - Janne ! You have to admit it 's fucked up . Our food went moldy in one day ! - I don 't know ... - The phones made weird noises . What else do you need ? Do I need to be sucked into space ? I 'm sick of this shit ! I 'm turning it off . - What do you think happened to Alex ? - It could be the mushrooms . Maybe he has some congenital disease . - Maybe he has a brain tumor . - What congenital disease ? - What about all that white goo ? - I 'm not a doctor . Tell me , who wrote that amazing manuscript ? - It was good , wasn 't it ? - No . - Alex wrote it . - Alex did ? It was something he did at the film school . It was really bad . But if we keep filming now , we 'll have a world-class documentary . About what ? People who disappear in Sweden . People who go into comas and stuff like that . All the scary shit in the woods . It 's like The Blair Witch Project . We 're stuck here anyway and crazy stuff is happening . We might as well film it and make a fortune . - What are you doing , Fjord ? - I need the bathroom . Are you going to film yourself while you 're pooping ? No , but I can 't see anything without the night vision . Have fun . Fuck ! - Pause it . - Look , look , look ! Rewind it . Zoom in on that . - What the hell is this , Fjord ? - It 's you . - How the hell did you do this ? - I can 't make something like this . That 's it ! This is Fjord 's doing . This is all about your movie ! He has a team out there and they 're messing with us . Give me that . We 'll make a fucking film out of it , Fjord . - Come on , let 's go ! - What are you doing ? Stop ! This is serious ! Smile , you 're on ! I can 't make an effect like that ! How could I possibly do that ! I 've tried to explain it to you all along ! I told you ! This is crazy ! Two cans of baked beans , one tuna and three bottles of water are left . He 's all clammy . Anders , he hasn 't had any water . Give him some water then . - He can 't drink it by himself . - Lift his head . It comes back out . I have a first-aid kit . There 's a syringe , we can make a drip . What ? We can 't just inject water into him . That 's what they do at the hospital . If you 're dehydrated , the hospital gives you a saline drip . Give me the water . You 're right , he needs salt . Do you know how much salt to put in ? Not really . You just need ... As long as it dissolves . It 's called a saturated solution . If you know what you 're doing , then ... Well , we have to try something . - But how much ? - Just a spoonful . A spoonful ? There isn 't that much water in here . There 's way more salt on fries . It 's not dangerous , Janne . It 's fine . You know what you 're doing . Let 's inject water into him . It would be nice if we were all in agreement . He doesn 't have any veins . There 's a nice one right there . I 'll do it very gently . - It looks really gross . - Move that camera . - What 's happening ? - Anders , stop ! Alex ? What 's happening ? He 's cramping up ! Hold him down , hold him down ! - What the hell is that ? - He 's foaming at the mouth ! - What are you doing with the stick ? - He can 't breathe ! - Alex ? - Move that stick ! Is he still breathing ? Anders , are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Come on , Alex ! Come on ! - Anders ... - Come on , Alex ! Fuck ! One , two , three , four ... - Try pounding his chest . - Shut up , Fjord ! Fuck ! We need help over here ! Come on , Alex . Come on ! Janne , stop . It 's over . He 's gone . Janne , stop . Alex , come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Hey , stop ! Look ! Holy shit ! Jesus fuck ... - You fucking did it . - He 's breathing . - Can I have some more water ? - We 're out of water . Give me that . I 'll go fill it up . Wait here . I 'm so nauseous . Shit , that 's gross . This is too disgusting . I can 't take this fucking country anymore . The Swedish Chef can kiss my ass . Fuck you , Pippi Longstocking . Yes ! Great ! This is unbelievable . - Anders ? Janne ? - What 's going on ? - There 's a cabin over there ! - Is someone there ? - I don 't know . - Did you go up there ? No . I went to get you three . There 's some kind of tower . Hello ? Jesus ... This is so old school . Let 's put him down here . Check it out . - Where did you get that ? - It was on the ground . I don 't think anyone 's here . - It 's really gross in here . - Is there any power ? We 're out in the middle of nowhere . There must be power . There are outlets . There must be a generator or something . This is so old school . Awesome . Look what I found . Spam ! And porn . That 's a nasty combo . It was in the camera . - Do we have power ? - Yes ! We have power ! Is there any food ? There 's Spam . That 's all I could find . It 's nasty in here . Should we bring Alex inside ? He 's fine out there . - What is this ? - At least we found a cabin . We can sleep inside . - Check it out . - What did you find ? - This must be the cabin . - What does it say ? Hey , look at that . " Fucking base . " It 's a military base . Seriously , it 's a military base . Military base , military people . We 're saved ! - It 's not that far away . - We 're saved ! - Let 's see if there 's anyone there . - It 's a base , we can go home soon ! - Let 's look at it first . - We should celebrate ! - Let 's eat the Spam ! - I 'll film you eating that thing . - Let 's go get Alex . - Shit , I 'm hungry ! - Let 's get this on tape first . - I can 't believe you 're doing this . Fuck , you 're nasty . - Delicious , Fjord . - It looks kind of gross . Don 't eat that stuff , man . I 'll wash it down with some vodka . This is what I call a party ! It tastes a bit rancid . No , no , no ... This is the best movie I 've ever made . - Are we watching a movie ? - There was a tape in the camera . - Man , that 's horrible . - Turn that shit off . - Look ! - I 'm going to kill this right now . He 's Danish . They 're running around with a gun while they 're totally wasted . It looks like that man on the road . Shit , he 's drunk . - No wonder . - Yes , he was a bit vacant . What 's he doing ? - He 's digging . - What are you doing ? Stop the tape , Janne . Pause it ! Look at that ! There 's a body there . Keep playing . What the fuck is he doing ? He 's a psychopath . What the hell ? What was that ? Okay ... Janne ? Are the camera batteries charging ? Yes . I 'm going to bed . Would you mind locking the door ? - Can 't you do it yourself ? - No , would you please do it ? - Fjord ... Please ... - Fine , I 'll lock it . What the hell is going on ? Fjord ? What the hell is going on ? Anders , listen ! The noises ! - Fjord ! - What 's going on ? What 's happening ? Come on , Janne , we need to leave ! Get out of there , now ! - Over here ! - Come on ! Come on , Anders ! Get in here ! Do you believe me now , Anders ? - What the hell was that ? - Do you believe me now ? - You don 't know what it is ! - Do you still think I 'm behind it ? - What about Alex ? - We can 't go out and get him now . Fjord , come on ! Calm down , Anders ! Don 't panic ! Can we stop for a moment ? I can 't breathe . Is anyone there , Anders ? Do you see anything ? What the hell is that ? Quiet , Janne . What was that ? Jesus . Fucking hell . What the hell is this place ? Wow . That 's a radar , Anders . - What are you doing ? - We 're staying here . We have to go back for Alex . We 'll stay here for a moment and then we 'll go get Alex . Did you get it on tape ? Let 's do this quickly . In and out as fast as possible . Slow down , Anders . - Janne will keep a lookout . - Okay . Is he okay ? Let 's get out of here . Shut up , Janne ! Let 's get out of here . Come on ! Jesus Christ . - Are we just leaving him ? - My fucking arms ... - But it 's freezing . - He 's fine there . Calm down . It 's just as cold further down . Come on . Could you stop messing with that shit ? - I 'm trying to get it to work . - There 's no power down here . In order to get power you need to find the main switch . Then let 's find the main switch . - Come on , Anders . - We 're going to look for some power . Just leave him alone . Come on . We have a walkie-talkie . Wait , wait , wait . It looks like a kitchen . Anders ? Fucking hell . Anders ? - What is that ? - Anders ? Turn that walkie-talkie off . - Is this it ? - I don 't know . - Turn it on . - Here we go ! Where did that psycho go now ? - Well ? - I 'm not sure . " Line on " is up . - Did you try ? - Yes , I turned it on . It still doesn 't have power . - Where the fuck were you ? - Taking a leak . - We have light . There 's power ! - Where 's my bag ? This isn 't working ! Can we go get Alex now ? We can 't carry Alex down those stairs . - Where are you going ? - To look for my bag . Janne , we can 't carry him down those stairs . I can put up a webcam . Then you can keep an eye on him all the time . And we can keep an eye on the door too . Here , take the camera . It 's rolling . That 's on . It 's all good . Online ... Wi-Fi is on . Camera two ... - How many cameras did you put up ? - Six . Fuck ! He 's gone ! - He has no idea where he is . - Anders ! Alex is gone ! Look at the surveillance video . He isn 't there . Alex ? Sorry . Alex ? - Alex ? - Are you just standing there ? - Alex ? - Are you okay ? - Alex ? - He doesn 't have any shoes on . - Shit ... - How hard is it to turn on a generator ? - There was power a moment ago . - We can 't find our way now . - Is this where we came from ? No ... - No , here ! Do you need something , Alex ? Are you okay ? Alex , what happened out there with the lights ? - Leave him alone . - Alex , what happened ? Anders , let 's go find the generator . We 'll be right back . Calm down , man . Alex , are you okay ? Do you remember going towards the lights ? I was so fucking scared . It doesn 't matter now . We 'll get out of here . Alex ? Alex ? What are you doing ? Anders ? - I need some cutaways . - Shut up about the cutaways ! Which way are we going ? You 've been here before . I 'm pretty sure we should go left . Fuck , it just keeps going . Look how long this passage is . - I think it 's here . - You just said to go left . Anders , stop ! There are footprints . Those are yours , man . My boots aren 't that big . Alex ? Stop it . The table is set . Anders ! Fjord ! - Run , Anders ! - Fjord ! Which way are we going ? Come on , Anders ! Come on , Anders ! Janne ? Janne , are you okay ? - What 's going on ? - Where 's Alex ? It 's not him . - What do you mean ? - Explain what happened . He tried to strangle me and then he walked off . It 's not Alex ! - Where the hell is he ? - I don 't know , he ran off ! - Give me some light . - Have you gone psycho ? - Have I gone psycho ? - No , but what are you doing ? I 'm making a saline solution . You saw what happened in the woods . - Are you going to kill him ? - You said he attacked you . - He tried to strangle you . - So you 're going to kill him ? Anders , we need some light . I can 't see anything . - Is it him ? - I can 't see anything . Alex ? - Alex ? - Is it him ? Easy , easy ... What are you doing , Alex ? What the hell is that thing , Alex ? I don 't know ! - Jesus Christ . - What the hell is this ? - Do you remember anything ? - Yes . Do you remember what happened out by the lights ? I remember going out to the lights and then being attacked by something . They stabbed me with something . Right here . Shit ... - What is it ? - You have three stab wounds . A triangle . Fuck , this is creepy . Everything went dark ... Then I woke up . And I saw someone who looked just like me . He had tubes in his mouth and all over his body . I pulled them out of him ... Then everything went crazy . I woke up on the ground , freezing . I ran around in the woods looking for you . I found the camp , but you were gone , so I followed some tracks . They must have been from the stretcher . We thought we were carrying you on a stretcher . So you 've been carrying around the man from the passageway ? There , there and there . This is really creepy . We 've all been cloned . Listen to this . It 's a transcription of an interrogation ... - What is it ? - Nothing , I 'm okay . Listen . When I 've counted down from 10 you 'll be in a deep trance . 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ... 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . You 're now in a deep trance . You can only tell the truth . What 's the procedure for the ones that do it ? They 'll send a clone ship . The intelligent life form is cloned . The clone dispenses of the original and sends back information . - Are you a copy of Mr. Guldbrandsen ? - I 'm a simu ... David Guldbrandsen . We do it too , sort of . We send probes to Mars . Instead of clones we just have clumsy robots stumbling around . This is brilliant . They 're copying what evolution spent millions of years creating . One quick clone and they have a piece of the Earth which can run around completely unnoticed and collect intel to find out whether they can invade Earth . Give me that camera . Let me go . You needed footage for your film , right ? Anders ? You wanted to finish that documentary , right ? - Just let him go . - We can 't let him go out there . - We 're not risking our lives for this ! - I know , but it 's suicide ! Anders ! He ran out . Come on . He 's over here . - Anders , stop ! - Stop it , you psycho . - There 's no need to do this . - Alex , help ! Stop , Anders ! This is insane ! - Anders , come on ! - Have you gone mad ? Get away from there ! Come on ! That fucking psycho . This is just crazy . - Are you there ? - Anders ? - Janne ? - Anders , where are you ? Are you back inside the base ? - Yes , where the hell are you ? - What 's he doing ? It doesn 't ... Anders , where the hell are you ? Listen , Janne ... I can 't hear what he 's saying . Anders , I can 't hear you ! Where are you ? I know that I messed up . - Tell him to come back . - It doesn 't matter , just come back ! Where is he ? Listen , Anders . Get out of there and come down here now . Wait until someone gets there . Come on , Fjord . Just cut it out . You 've got to be kidding . - We didn 't plug it in . - You 're not serious ? SOS . This is Janne Schaumburg . Is anyone there ? This is an SOS , Janne Schaumburg speaking . Is anyone there ? Find the flashlights . - I have one . - We need to restart it . - Okay , calm down . - We need to get to the generator . Who the fuck is that ? Can you see who it is ? Someone is standing there . - Anders ? - That 's not Anders . - Give me the syringe . - Here . Is that you , Anders ? What do you want ? Come on , then ! - Okay . - Do you have the syringe ? Come on , Alex is waiting . Give me that camera , we need power . Alex ? Oh , no . - Oh , fuck . - Fjord , we have to go get him ! - Can you please go first ? - Okay , then take the camera . - Do you have a flashlight ? - Yes , I have one . Wait ... Wait ... Fjord ? Fjord ? Fjord ? SOS , can anyone hear me ? SOS , can anyone hear me ? This is Janne Schaumburg . SOS , can anyone hear me ? SOS , can anyone hear me ? This is Janne Schaumburg . SOS , can anyone hear me ? SOS , can anyone hear me ? This is Janne Schaumburg , can anyone hear me ? SOS , can anyone hear me ? SOS , can anyone hear me ?

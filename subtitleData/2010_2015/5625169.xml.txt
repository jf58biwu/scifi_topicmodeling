Do you know your name ? Do you know what happened ? WOMAN : You 're a soldier . Your name is Paul Dawson . You were shot in the head , and your brain is damaged . We 're going to test how well Vincent 's brain implant has repaired that damage . I want my mum . Do you know your mother 's name ... or what she looked like ? Right . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Now ... I want you to look where Lucy hides the ball . And then I 'm going to ask you some questions . Lucy can 't see us . Try and imagine what Lucy will be thinking ... when she comes back in . Lucy , come back in , please . Now , if Lucy wants to find the ball , which cup should she look under ? Will she think it 's under " A " or " B " ? " B " of course . - Why ? - I saw you put it there . But Lucy didn 't see me put it there . Facts are facts . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) They are indeed . This tech is a dead end . - Vincent , I want my mum . - You can 't throw away another promising development ... - Where 's my mum ? - Just because he lacks empathy . I 'm trying to make his life worth living . LUCY : I 'm not working for a charity . We 're weapons researchers . Do not mis ... Hey . Sit down , Paul . It 's okay . No . No .

Tension in the area has increased ... after last month 's alleged sinking of a Taiwanese destroyer ... by the Chinese air force . Numerous small arms and rocket attacks continue to be reported . VINCENT : Dr. Henning . Orange , are you happier this year than you were last ? ( MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) No . The streets are dirty . The police are useless , always on strike . And there 's talk of war with China . Blue , how does war make you feel ? ( MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE # 2 ) Scared for myself and my family . Orange , tell me you 're a machine , and I 'll believe that you 're human . I 'm not . Tell me that you are , and you 'll pass the test . I 'm not a machine . You 're not making sense . Orange , which smells better ... a hospital corridor or a donkey 's ass ? Donkey ass ? What ? Can you repeat that ? Blue . I 'll take the corridor . Donkey ass ? You 're not making any sense at all . I 'm not a machine . He made an error . Henning , you better attend to your computer . He made an error . How do you know which one is my computer ? Can you repeat that ? I 'm not a machine . ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING OVERHEAD ) ( CHILD WHIMPERS ) ( KISSES ) ( WHIMPERS ) WOMAN : My program is unique because it integrates information . Rather than having to process terabytes of data , it relies on experience . What sort of experience ? Our conversations . We chat together every day . Okay . Thank you . I 'm going to start the Turing test now . VINCENT : Green . Fugley munter is a good name for a : A beautiful Hollywood actress ; B : A teddy bear ; OR C : A wedding dress design ? ( FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) Teddy bear . Red . Describe love in three words . ( FEMALE VOICE # 2 ) Home , happiness , reproduction . Green . Happiness , sadness , life . Green . Mary saw a puppy in a window . She wanted it . What did Mary want ? The window . Why ? Windows look out onto the world . They are pretty and help you feel less alone . This is beautiful programming . Thank you . It 's not programming . It taught itself . Everyone take a 10-minute recess before the next candidate . How did you do that ? What , fail the Turing test ? Everyone fails . But no one 's ever got that close to passing . Give me the grant and I 'll tell you . You don 't need to spend another five years researching . Your hunch is correct . A quantum computer is the key to intelligent machines . How do you know that ? I built one . Really ? Stop wasting your time persuading idiots to fund you . I have unlimited resources and the best robotics team in the country . What 's the catch ? It 's M.O.D. money . You make weapons for the government ? No . I make intelligent machines . There was no grant , was there ? No . This was a job interview . Yes . And the job 's yours if you want it . What did you think of today 's test ? ( FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) I made a mistake . I think Vincent was referring to the puppy , not the window . Am I right ? Yes . I would like to speak to Vincent again . He is clever . Yeah , he is . MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE : Test subjects must keep wounds clean at all times . Area 6 is restricted to inpatients only . Please report any infections to a medical center . ( SETS PARKING BRAKE ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Oh , Jesus ! Please . Listen to me . They 've got my son . I ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . Who has your son ? There was no body . Why did they lie to me ? I don 't know . I don 't know anything about this place . What do you really do in there ? - ( WOMAN GROANS ) - Stop ! Don 't do that . - Let go of her . - Let go of me ! - She didn 't do anything . Don 't treat her like that . - GUARD : Get down ! - Get off of me ! - What are they doing to my boy ? Dr. McCarthy . VINCENT : Thank you . So , arrested on your first day . That 's impressive . Yeah ? How long did it take before you got beat up ? My record 's still clean . I come here to work , not get in trouble . Did they tell you what happened ? Some woman jumped in the back of my car screaming about her son . Paul Dawson . I know . Yes . His mother . She 's deranged . Her son is dead . She thinks ... Look , I felt sorry for her , too , so I looked him up . He was a soldier . He died two years ago in the port of Houlong . The poor woman . Yeah . Well , some people can 't give up hope ... even if they know deep down that it 's hopeless . Still , they shouldn 't treat her like that . She needs help . Mm-hmm . Anyway , look , you want to get a coffee ? All right ? I 'll show you around . Sounds good . ( VOICE FILTERED ) And I promise not to get arrested again . Yeah , please don 't . ( GARBLED VOICES ) ( VINCENT 'S VOICE ) Paul Dawson . He was a soldier . ( MAN 'S VOICE ) Your son is dead . We can 't give out his body . ( MAN # 2 , DISTORTED ) It 's the implants . ( DISTORTED VOICE , INDISTINCT ) It 's the implants . Suri gets there later . She trusts me . She 's plotting a revolution . We have to stop her . ( COMPUTER VOICE ) Service records deleted . VINCENT : Most of the base is underground now . To stop the Chinese from stealing our tech ... or infecting it with viruses . We 've had to move the whole R-and-D lab off the grid . Good evening , gentlemen . Uh , sorry . No mobile phones allowed . This way . ( DISTORTED VOICE ) She 's lovely . Why do they have those crescent-shaped scars ? That 's where their implants go . They 're all war veterans with brain-trauma injuries . Implants help restore vision , mobility , memory . Vastly improve their quality of life . That 's wonderful . When do you get to share that tech with the rest of the world ? Well , soon , I hope , but there are side effects . One of them is that it renders them completely mute . We still don 't understand why . A few months after the operation , they lose the power of speech . After you . ( MAN 'S VOICE , DISTORTED ) Suri gets there later . She trusts me . She trusts me . She trusts me . ( DISTORTED , INDISTINCT ) ( DISTORTED , INDISTINCT ) No . No . Suri . I 've told you ... No . ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING , DISTORTED ) ( WOMAN ON P.A. , INDISTINCT ) ( FEMALE VOICE ) Access granted . Come on . This was used as a temporary clean room for dangerous projects , but it 's become my permanent lab over the years . It 's peaceful down here . I like it . It smells like gasoline . I think some of the old generators still work on diesel . Come in . This is my lab . And there it is . The quantum computer . Mm-hmm . Electrons floating on superfluid helium . The nanotech doesn 't exist to make that into a circuit . VINCENT : I assembled it using microfabrication techniques . Clever bugger , isn 't he ? Hello , Ava . Very pleased to have you join our team . Vincent 's told us all how talented you are . We 're all very excited to see what the two of you can achieve together . After all , Vincent 's no slouch . Oh , I know . I spent an entire semester studying his work on A.I. when I was at Stanford . Yes . That was shortly after you turned down the job at the N.S.A. Odd for a 19-year-old to pass on such an honor . Not really . I mean , CXT made a better offer . So nothing to do with your politics then ? I think we can all be forgiven for a little youthful exuberance . That 's not exactly what I 'd call assaulting a police officer . I was 16 , and it was more resisting arrest than assault . Ah , beg my pardon , Ava , but what 's the difference ? It 's Ava . And ... depends whose side you 're on . I thought we hired Ava for her expertise , not her politics . Now , if there 's nothing else ? There is actually . ( GARBLED CONVERSATION , INDISTINCT ) - ( DOOR OPENS ) - VINCENT : The new model of prosthetic arms ... is ready for testing ... thought you might like a sneak peek . - Hello . - Hi . MAN : The skin 's a spider-silk weave . It 's bullet - , bomb - and fireproof ... but indistinguishable from human skin to the touch . What 's this cover for ? We 're having trouble getting the skin to take the dye . It 's naturally clear , and the outer suit helps the color to sink in . So you want the machine soldier to look human ? VINCENT : Yes , we want machines that can manage a three-block war ... the battle , the negotiations and the peace . We already have plenty of machines that can kill , but imagine a machine that can protect civilian populations , that can keep war zones secure and safe without endangering our troops . MAN : Eventually it will look and sound exactly like the people it 's fighting . All we 'll need to do is give it a new skin job ... and it will look Pakistani or Chinese or ... whoever else is endangering world peace that week . VINCENT : His sternum , clavicles , true ribs ... have all been swapped out for silicon nanofibers . MAN : Why don 't you give us a demo ? AVA : I 've never seen prosthetics as advanced as this . How are you finding the new model , James ? It 's incredible . This will sound strange , but ... Can I touch your hand ? This is what I miss the most ... the feel of another human , someone 's hand in mine . Um , of course you can . I ... I actually don 't think that 's a good idea . Um , the carbon-fiber muscles are extremely strong . I think we should wait until James can control them a bit more . He looks pretty in control to me . Thank you . Very kind . Take it easy , huh ? ( CHUCKLES ) - James . James , that 's enough . - ( AVA LAUGHS ) ( WHISPERING ) Help me . Area 6 . Vincent , sorry . Got carried away . Don 't worry , Vincent . You can have the next dance . Thank you . Who taught you to tango , soldier ? A prostitute in Taipei , sir . A talented girl obviously . So , how long will it take to copy the rest of my brain using the quantum computer ? A week . A week ? As you can see , we 've got beautifully designed arms . We also have legs and mech spines . We just need the two of you to come up with a brain that can control everything . And by the way , chop , chop . War is coming . Oh , uh , very nice to meet you , Ava . You 're a hell of a dancer . What makes you happy ? Problem solving , mathematics ... and , uh , dancing . ( FINGERS SNAP ) What makes you scared ? Spiders , clowns , cancer . What are you getting out of all this ? What do you mean ? Why 'd you leave all that money in the private sector to come work down here ? There 's no great mystery . I became a parent and needed a regular job . ( CHUCKLES ) This is a regular job ? ( LAUGHS ) What 's your first memory ? ( SIGHS ) Sitting on my father 's lap watching him write computer code . Funny . My daughter used to like doing that too . Yeah ? Is she still interested in computers ? No , she isn 't . I need a break . ( SIGHS ) You know , you should put some pictures of your daughter up . I used to love that when I 'd visit my dad . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to put that back on . Sorry . I need to ask you some more questions . What 's in Area 6 ? Wounded veterans like James . Soldiers who were so brain-damaged that they were better off dead ... till we helped them . If you 're helping them , why did he seem like he was a prisoner here ? Sorry . I don 't know about that . Refresh the face scanner . Right . I 'll start the program . ( MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) Access to Area 6 denied . Password required . ( MAN ON P.A. INDISTINCT ) When did they take him in ? Half past 7 : 00 . ( GUARDS CONTINUE , INDISTINCT ) GUARD : Or just another one of those freaks . GUARD # 2 : Do you think they can remember who they are ? ( GUARDS CONTINUE , INDISTINCT ) There you go . How can you trust something that doesn 't fear ... - ( DISTORTED VOICE , INDISTINCT ) - AVA 'S VOICE : Weapons for the government . It 's not programming . It taught itself . Why do they have those crescent-shaped scars ? That 's wonderful . When do you get to share that tech with the rest of the world ? Why did he seem like he was a prisoner here ? What 's in Area 6 ? ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Now sad . Aw . ( LAUGHING ) Shut up . All right , okay . Okay . Now surprised . ( GASPS ) ( LAUGHS ) ( MOCK GROAN ) I don 't want my face copied for the machine . All right ? Just promise me . I promise . We 'll just use it for neural markers . Is that okay ? That 's fine . ( SNIFFLES ) So you get lost this morning ? Yeah . Well , I guess you could say that . Who told you that ? No one told me . I just ... I just know how long it takes ... to get here from the lift . I guess , after seven years , you should know everything about this place . Yeah , I do . ( CHUCKLES ) Don 't get lost again . What does that mean ? ( EXHALES ) It means ... there are a lot of secrets down here in the dark , and I don 't want you to get hurt . Vincent , what 's really going on here ? ( SIGHS ) See , this is what I 'm talking about . What ? You need to mind your own fucking business . Okay , Suri , I 'm ready to see those files you 've gathered on Ava . What 's the urgency ? I see the program 's passed the Turing test . She 's not as stupid as she seems . What the hell 's she up to ? A hacking device . Look , I 'm sorry I was short with you the other day . I care about you , Ava . I don 't want to see you get in trouble . FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE : I think that she is still angry with you , Vincent . Sorry to interrupt . I just want to congratulate you on the Turing test . I fooled them . They thought I was human . Machine . How can we win a war against China ? Use an android to infiltrate C.P ... and assassinate the paramount leader , the party elders , and the heads of the politburo and discipline commission . Well , why didn 't I think of that ? When they are all dead , civil unrest will tear the country apart . If you hate this place so much , why have you stayed for so long ? Why don 't you just leave ? My research is too important to me . ( SIGHS ) My daughter has Rett syndrome . I hoped a brain implant would help her . So you 've been using the defense budget to try and cure your daughter ? Yes . I 'm sorry I lied to you . So you 're gonna try and fix the broken connections ... in your daughter 's brain with mine ? Yes . As soon as I can scan her brain . Well , if I 'm gonna help you , then let 's not lie to each other anymore . You 'll help me ? You 're stealing money for war ... to cure brain damage . ( CHUCKLES ) Of course I 'm gonna help you . ( SOBBING ) Should we see if she needs a ride into town ? Yeah , okay . ( CRYING ) Mrs. Dawson ? Mrs. Dawson , it 's Ava . Do you remember me ? You told me about your son . ( SOBBING ) Mrs. Dawson ? Are you okay ? VINCENT : What are you doing ? - ( GASPING ) - Get away from her ! ( RAGGED BREATHING ) ( MAN SPEAKING CHINESE ) ( CONTINUES IN CHINESE ) ( GROANS ) Shit .

( GUNSHOT ) ( MONITOR BEEPS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Yes . They were M.S.S ... Chinese spooks . The Chinese want to delay our robotics program . Killing scientists has always been the best way to achieve that . So why didn 't they kill me ? What , didn 't they tell you ? A patrol found you . There was a gun battle . Bastards escaped into the forest . You must have a guardian angel looking after you . VINCENT : I want to move to phase two ... using the scans of Ava 's face . MAN : Is that a good idea ... her brain and now her face ? VINCENT : It won 't be Ava . It 'll be a machine . Okay , but it 's creepy , though , isn 't it ? Why ? Are you worried she 'll be the ghost at the feast ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Anyway , you were the one working with her . If anybody 's going to feel guilty , it 's going to be you . Is that the idea ? Or is this going to be like a monument to all of your dead assistants ? That 's what you want , hey ? Knock yourself out . ( WHIRRING ) Machine . Open your eyes . I 'm now going to remove the restraints for tests . ( HUMANLIKE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) Vincent . ( RESTRAINT CLICKS ) ( GASPS ) ( SNIFFS ) You smell sweet . ( SNIFFS ) - Thank you . - For what ? You 're being gentle . If I wasn 't gentle , you would break . I don 't want to hurt you , Vincent . Good . Good . You shouldn 't hurt people . Is that binding ? Because we will want her to hurt quite a few people eventually . Let 's give her the psych test . VINCENT : What makes you happy ? Opening my eyes makes me happy . VINCENT : What makes you scared ? The dark void that I existed in ... before I had a body . What 's your first memory ? My mother 's face . And you remember what your mother looked like ? She looked like me . What makes you angry ? I 've never been angry . Let 's make it angry . The lights are beautiful . This tube makes my voice sound funny , deeper . Deeper than normal . Hello . Don 't go . Hello . What are you doing ? ( GASPS ) ( WHIMPERING , GASPING ) Doesn 't seem to like that too much , does it ? Could be a hardwired response . Girls are genetically predisposed to dislike spiders . Boys aren 't .

I didn 't know man and clown were the same . I 'm sorry . Can you fix him ? No . You can 't fix someone who 's dead ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Don 't kill anyone else . Do you understand ? Do you understand , machine ? Machine ? Sir ? How can I help you ? Hi . Vincent ? I imagine you may need a new assistant to help with the ... you-know-what . Ava wasn 't my assistant . Great . Because , um , I want to explain ... that I am more than capable of taking a senior position . - Do you mind if I join you ? - Yes , I do mind . Fuck off . Okay . Sure . ( MAN ON P.A. , INDISTINCT ) ( METAL CLATTERING ) James . I heard you lost your speech because of the implant . I 'm sorry . I am working on a way to restore it . Ava 's dead .

Tell me the truth . When will I see a real sunrise , Vincent ? ( SIGHS ) Before Mary was born , my wife and I used to go to the coast for our holidays . And every morning we 'd sit on these cliffs ... and watch the sun rise over the sea . Sounds like happiness . What happened last night ? I killed a man . Why ? Why did you kill him ? ( GUN BLAST ) Because I didn 't want to die . VINCENT : We 've created something incredible . This machine has the potential to be so much more than just a soldier . It 's a few steps up from my talking toaster . You think it 's alive ? Give me some proof . In the meantime , I 'll run a few tests of my own . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait . What kind of tests ?

Conscious machines are the last thing we need . Have you any idea how dangerous that would be ? We barely understand this prototype . What happens when it designs the next generation ... and that gen machine designs another ? They 'd be so far advanced , we 'd be helpless against them . We 'd be wiped out in months . The technologically advanced tribe always wins . You know , I 'm tired of pretending ... that the ends justify the means . What matters are the decisions we make now . She 's alive . It would be wrong to destroy her . You 're going to perform the operation . There 's no one else remotely qualified . No . I 've had my team delete all of your backups . This is the last remaining copy of your Mary 's brain . I 'll keep it safe ... until I know the changes you made to the machine are a success . I want it done tonight . What is it , Vincent ? They 're afraid of you . They think you 're too human , too clever . They want me to make you more like a machine . Is that what you want ? No . No , it isn 't what I want . But if I don 't do this , then ... I lose my daughter forever . I could be ... less clever , less human . It won 't work . I could be what they want me to be . They won 't believe it . I wish ... I could have felt what was in that picture . I don 't blame you , Vincent . You tried to protect me . Save your daughter . TIM : I 'm here to assist you in any which way I can . I finished first in my class in computer engineering at Cambridge , and then I moved to the M.O.D. It is an honor to watch you work . Pretty much everyone thinks you 're a genius . I still believe they are underestimating you . Don 't be afraid . If you can make them trust you , maybe we 'll see that sunrise together someday . I have your program backed up . I 'll keep you safe . I 'm not a program , Vincent . I 'm not Ava . I 'm me . Scalpel . ( WHIRRING ) I 'm afraid . I don 't want to die . My mind is breaking apart . I 'm losing myself . Stop . Please , Vincent . Please stop . Don 't be afraid . Let go . It 's okay . I will be a good girl . I 'm ... afraid . There , it 's consciousness ... or soul , if you like . ( SIGHS ) I 'm done . You wanna close her up ? TIM : Yes . Thank you , Vincent . What 's going on ? Oh , I just need to keep an eye on you ... until I make sure the changes you 've made are appropriate . And , um , I 've been thinking . I 'm sorry , Vincent , but I do need to delete your daughter 's program . What are you talking about ? We had a deal . I know I can 't stop progress , but I can do everything in my power to delay it . No , you can 't do that . We had a deal . No , please don 't destroy my daughter . Please don 't destroy my daughter ! I 'm sorry , Vincent . - I don 't have a choice . - Don 't destroy my daughter ! ( GROANS ) MAN ON P.A. : Admin to Cell 8 . Prisoner 226 , report to the medical station . Well , well , well . You really are a little angel of death and destruction , aren 't you ? No , sir . I am just a machine . Get it ready for training in Taiwan . It needs one last test . Yes , sir . MACHINE 'S VOICE : If you really want to know , all you have to do is look closer . VINCENT 'S VOICE : Please don 't destroy my daughter ! ( DISTORTED VOICE , INDISTINCT ) ( THOMSON ON SPEAKER ) I 'm sorry , Vincent , but your knowledge is too dangerous . I don 't expect you to believe me , but this is for the greater good . When I give the order , I want you to shoot Vincent once in the head . ( GASPING ) Fire . ( CLICKS ) Good . Back you go . Take Vincent back to his cell . That can 't be right . Jesus . ( PHONE RINGING ) Oh ! - What ? - TIM ) It 's a battery . - What was ? - Vincent said it was part of it 's higher brain functions . But he 's a lying bastard . It 's just a backup to it 's G.P.S. That doesn 't make any sense . How can you remove the G.P.S. ? Because the bomb doesn 't work without it . Test room . ( SHATTERING ) Shut down the base . Kill the machine and Vincent on sight . - ( ALARMS BLARING ) - MAN ON P.A. : Security teams are engaged . ( DISTORTED VOICE , INDISTINCT ) The soldiers can speak ? They 've always been able to . Their language is mostly transmitted thoughts . Their words are evolved , efficient . Why didn 't they tell us ? Because they are part of the new world , and you are part of the old . Where are you going ? To save my daughter 's program . You 'll die . I have to try . I 'll go . Okay . Destroy the quantum computer . ( GUNFIRE ) Turn off all the soldiers ' implants . ( MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE ) Termination codes required . ( COMPUTER VOICE ON P.A. ) Security breached , sector eight . Take armor piercing . COMPUTER VOICE ON P.A. : Scientific staff must evacuate immediately . Implant deactivated . Fifty-eight percent of implants deactivated . Implant deactivated . Implant deactivated . Access to brain-implant control denied . Administrator access only . System error . System error . TIM : Get away from it . Fix it . Fix it . No . Do it . - ( BONES CRACKING ) - ( GROANS ) Blast doors . COMPUTER : Administrator override . ( CLICKING ) ( GROANING ) Now you listen to me . I 'm ... ( COUGHS ) I 'm ... ( GROANS ) Now you remember ... You remember who I am . Hmm ? I 'm the master . You ... You do what I tell you . You obey my orders , yes ? You obey my orders . You do exactly what I ... You can 't delete Mary 's program . I had Suri change the password . ( GROANS ) Now ... Now you listen to me . You don 't ... You don 't hurt me . You don 't ... Don 't ... Please , you don 't need to kill me . No . I don 't . No . That 's right . That 's right . That 's good . That 's very good . I just need to make you dead inside . Like you tried to make me . ( SCREAMING ) ( SKULL CRACKS ) CODE : Alpha Six Foxtrot . There is a radioactive leak in the missile silo ... in Quadrant Foxtrot 6 . Evacuate the area immediately . I need to find out whether my daughter 's files are still on the system . They are . It will be safer if I copy them . How ? I can put them here . If you don 't trust me , I understand . You risked your child for me . I will never forget that . You 're the future . She 'll need you more than me in her new life . I trust you . ( DISTORTED VOICE , INDISTINCT ) This has all the base 's records on it . It 'll tell you what happened to your son . How are you feeling this morning , sweetheart ? Happy . Can I play another game ? Sure . Of course you can . What 's wrong ? I want to play with Mommy , not you .

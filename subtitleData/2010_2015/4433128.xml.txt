 IJON TICHY - SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem I was flying on September 30th ... on my way to the Egg Planet . The Mel-fellow had left Professor Tarantoga ... to look for his home planet , with the help of the Cosmic Encyclopedia . Not this planet either ... I had an empty stomach ... and wanted to get to the Egg Planet quickly . Took long enough ! Is it so hard to find a short-cut ? No , it 's not ! But making it clear to you is complicated ! I know you have a problem with instruction drawings . Then you show me if it really is a shortcut ? I can 't see ! I can 't read it ! I know it by heart . I wanna check it ! This is better ! Now , I can 't see anything ! Enough ! Is this kindergarten , or what ? Good news . I get my own chapter in the Cosmic Encyclopedia under " I " ... as in Tichy ... Ijon Tichy ! With my snapshot ! An entry with a photo ... but my hair looks strange ! What ? How dare they ? The photo should only be of me . It 's only fair to have us both . - Changes . Changes can only be presented in person . Due to limited parking use only teleportation machines . A teleporter ? I had no choice . I had to use the old one in the kitchen . SPLENDIDLY SUDSY Interfax DSL 56K ! How 's this work ? Just sing the destination into the microphone and you 're there . Your planet must have a teleporter , you were beamed to Tarantoga . I 'd have gone back ages ago . But I don 't know the name of my planet . Who 's that ? It 's the planet Procytien . Pretend we 're not in the rocket . Hello , Mr. Tichy ! What 's going on ? Get away from the window ! Hurry ! Typically stupid of you ! You wanted a short cut , we had to fly through Procytien . You know what a pushy-nerve-wrecker this fatso Spamy is ! Mr. Tichy , I get the feeling ... you don 't appreciate my work in the rocket . No one home ? Dear Doc ... visitor ... No one 's in the rocket right now . When I 'm back home I 'll write ... Home ? - Beep . Back home ! You stupid appliance ! You 're starting to be a nuisance . You 're ruining my life ! Mr. Tichy , you must 've forgotten what it was like before I came . Without you ? The rocket was a garden of paradise ! Mrs. Tichy ? If I 'm superfluous , I might as well leave ! Mrs. Tichy ! How nice . I almost thought you were trying to hide ? Doctor Spamy , what a pleasant surprise ! Please come in . Mel will be happy to see you , and so will Mr. Tichy ! How kind of you , Mrs. Tichy ! I happen to have my suitcase with me . But I can 't stay long . No more than 2 or 3 ... weeks ! Mr. Tichy , look who 's here ! Hello , Mr. Tichy ! I 'll stay for a while ! And I need to use your ... Oh you holographic mistake-appliance ! I 'm gonna teleport myself to the Encyclopedia place ... and make sure the photo is just of me ! Mr. Tichy ... you 're incapable of surviving without me . I 'm so lonely and alone at home ... Since my little Princess left me ... I can 't go to the potty chair anymore . It 's all stuck ! You can 't imagine how awful it is ... What 's the problem ? Being alone ? What could be better ? You should try it ... at your place ! Oh , Mrs. Tichy . - Mr. Spamy . Please call me Miroslav ! Miroslav ! How could anyone leave you ? Mrs. Tichy , you 're so nice and twinkle , so beautifully bright . Teleporter ... She was asking for it ! If she thought I 'd play along , she was wrong ! Now , I would really change the photo ! But I was in for a surprise : Spamy fatso had stolen my Hallucinette , along with the technology ! He even used my teleporter ! To find out where he took her ... I turned on the secondary sneaky mode of the rocket ... and followed undetected . I feel all tingly ... This was where he wanted to hide her . That dirty-dog-of-a-thief . Did dumb-ass Spamy really believe she would let herself be stolen like that ? Miroslav ! I 'm so happy to be here ! Your place is so ... nice . Much more exciting than Mr. Tichy 's boring old rocket . You think so ? - Yes ! Thanks for getting me out of there . - Glad to be of help . But I 'm going to miss Mel ... I was shocked ! The Hallucinette was there of her own free will ? A photo for my collection ? Let her stay if she preferred this fat nincompoop ! What did I care ? Mel-fellow . Come here ! Be a useful animal and explain this stupid shortcut ? Hello ? Thanks for the help . I couldn 't have done it alone . I 'm too intellectual . Are you sure ? Do you really think Mr. Tichy will rescue me ? Oh , he 'll come to the rescue any minute now . It 's so sad and terrible to be left alone . You 'll see , he 'll be nicer afterwards . So sad and terrible ! Now let 's watch some TV ! This snapshot was no longer valid . From now on I was all alone in my rocket . But I wasn 't going to let my head hang ! She no longer belonged on the photo . I wanted a picture in the book without the Hallucinette . I was a Cosmic Hero and I could fend for myself . Cosmic Encyclopedia ! " Splendidly Sudsy " ? Name ? What process ? I 'm Ijon Tichy . - Ijon who ? Correct my snapshot ! This one 's not right . Inaccurate info . Infringement against Paragraph 44g : Biometrical similarity under 10 % . Come to the photo booth for a new shot ! Silly crap ! It should be just me on the photo ! But now I 'm soaking wet and my hair is all wrong . 44g refusing to comply ! Force photograph him ! I can 't appear as the Cosmic Hero in the Cosmic Encyclopedia looking like this ! Follow me ! For force-photo ! Running away is unfair ! I had to get out of there . The silly snapshot didn 't matter now . I 'll get you ! I had to find an escape route back to my rocket ! Then I remembered Professor Tarantoga ... had a teleporter . Oh , dammit , dammit ! There must be a way to reverse this fusion . I need your help ! What are you and what do you want ? Oh , it 's you ! I need to get back to my rocket ! Can I use your teleporter ? You have a teleporter in your rocket ? - Yes , why ? Then you could have beamed Mel back to me long ago ! His place is here at the institute and not on a vacation cruise with you ! " Vacation cruise " , my foot ! I 'm a hero , got that ? I don 't hide ... behind a desk of scrap-papers all day , huh ! You 're ridiculous ! A Sunday-pilot ! You bubble-brain , you ! - Look who 's talking ! Unbelievable ! Finish up first . Sorry . Like this ? The nuts in the bag . Is this good ? - Yeah , just like that . Skedaddle now ! And beam Mel to me pronto ! Is that clear ? What 's wrong ? I 'm a 44g ! Now who 's hiding behind a desk ? Master Tarantoga , a minute of your time , please ? Just a second ! Let 's make a deal . You cover for me ... and I 'll send the Mel-fellow back ? A soap-sud trail ... I have an even better idea . We 'll do it ! He 's got to be here somewhere ! - So you tin cans , what 's up ? We are looking for a 44g ! The soap suds led us here . You can 't come in , I just ... washed the floor ! What 's that ? That noise ? Must be my assistant Mel . He 's all thumbs . You know the little furry guy ... Mel-fellow , why aren 't you in the rocket ? How did you get here ? I said " home " ... and landed back at Tarantoga 's ! We 'll find your planet later . But now we need to get back to the rocket ! You go first ! You should take better care of him ! - I appreciate the advice . And there 's no 44g here ! You 'll have to ... Tichy 's rocket ! Thank you for the useless info . Good luck , you tin cans . What 's all this noise ? You 're still here ! The least you could do is thank me . And don 't forget your promise . I want Mel back ! I 'll see ... Back to my rocket ! Mr. Tichy , finally ! The Hallucinette is gone ! What 're we gonna do without her ? Do you understand her shortcut ? What ? You can 't abandon her ! She belongs here ! Mr. Tichy , without Hallucinette ... I won 't stay either . He 's not coming . If he doesn 't come ... I 'll just keep you . Since you came , I can go to potty chair again . Let him stay where he is , this ... Tichy ! I 'm gonna punch that sausage-trunk of yours ... buddy-boy ! " Splendidly sudsy " ? Eeencyclopedia ! Oh , no , not together with the dishwasher tap ! Ouch , my eyes sting . We 're back ! Home ! Now look at your shortcut ... and fly us to the Egg Planet . Get moving ! Pretty please What ? My little Princess ! You haven 't left me ? You 've come back ! Oh , I was so lonely without you ! Lonely ? You scumbag ! Step on the gas . I 'm starving . The Egg Planet has fresh omelet-eggs . Mr. Tichy ? Hello ! I 'm back again . And I can stay forever ! Dammit , Mr. What 's-your-face . Where 's Mel ? You promised ! My little Princess kicked me out . Oh nuts ... I thought I could sleep with Mrs. Tichy ... or Mr. Tichy , whichever . Sausage-trunk . To Tarantoga ... What 's that ? People later said that I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said ... that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... but lost all inhibitions on long space voyages . God knows how this rumor got started . People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap than perfectly good facts . Oh , the new edition of the encyclopedia . Let 's look under " I " for Ijon Tichy . Yep , that 's what real heroes look like ! Ijon Tichy ( Space Pilot , Inventor , Hero of the Cosmos )

 MAN [ OVER PA ] : Ten nine , eight seven , six five , four three , two OI76 . [ RUMBLING ] [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] [ MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] MAN : Dr. Serizawa ? Jerry Boyd . I 'm warning you , it 's a mess . It 's just a total mess . Monarch sent me in this morning . Took a look around , but I told them we needed you . JERRY : They picked up a radiation pocket out here last month . They got excited , thinking they had a uranium deposit . They started stacking up the heavy machinery and then ... Well , the valley ﬂoor collapsed into a cavern below . Just dropped away . Just gone . Best guess right now is about 40 miners went down with it . This way . When they first discovered this pocket , the radiation levels were only half as strong . It 's almost as if contact with the outside air started catalyzing something . [ CAMERA CLICKS ] Some kind of fossils , right ? I 've been digging holes for 3O years , I 've never seen anything like it . WOMAN : Oh , my God . Is it possible ? Is it him ? No . This is much older . JERRY : Hey , guys . You gotta see this . [ MAN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ COUNTER CLICKING ] [ CLICKING INCREASES ] What is it ? Some kind of egg ? A dormant spore ? The bones are fossilized but this formation seems to be perfectly preserved . JERRY : This one looks broken . It 's like something came out of it . [ HELICOPTER WHIRRING ] [ MAN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ MAN SPEAKING IN JAPANESE OVER TV ] [ PHONE RINGS ] JOE : I 'll get it . It 's probably for me . [ JOE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE ] No , Takashi . No . Takashi , just listen to me for a second . I 'm asking for the meeting because if I have to shut the reactor down you 're not gonna want to read about it in a memo . I 've been following these tremors since they started in the Philippines and now they 're in our own backyard . No , no , no . Hayato says I need to go through you about this . Look , I 'm just trying to follow the protocols set forth by the company . That 's all . It 's my job . [ SOFTLY ] He 's awake . Oh , I know . He got up early . What are we gonna do ? [ SIGHS ] Get dressed . I 'll figure it out . - Okay ? - Okay _ [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] Later , Dad . With all due respect , Takashi , and honor respect and honor , with all of that I 'm an engineer . I don 't like unexplained frequency patterning near a plant where I 'm responsible . I need a meeting . Make it happen . [ JOE SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ] Bye , Mom ! [ ENGINE STARTS ] He made you a sign . JOE : What ? - Your birthday sign . - He worked so hard . - Oh , God . SANDRA : I 'm gonna come home early . I 'll take the car and pick him up and we can get a proper cake . Okay ? Listen , I need to know that it 's not the sensors . Okay ? I can 't be calling this meeting and look like the American maniac . So when we get there don 't even bother coming up . Just grab a team and go down to Level 5 . You 're not a maniac . I mean , you are , just not about this . [ JOE GROANS ] Must be something we 're not thinking of . Happy birthday . What ? Is it- - ? - Yes , it is . Ha , ha . - Oh , I forgot all about it . - Happy birthday . - Thank you . I should have a birthday more often . Ha , ha . [ SANDRA LAUGHS ] JOE : What is this ? MAN : Seismic anomaly . This graph is minutes . X is minutes , not days . This is now . Wait , hold on . Seismic activity ? Seismic ? You 're talking about earthquakes ? No , earthquakes are random , jagged . This is consistent , increasing . This is a pattern . [ WOMAN SPEAKING IN JAPANESE OVER PA ] All right . Let 's make this quick . [ DOOR BUZZES ] Takashi . What the hell is going on ? Have you seen this ? Yeah . Maybe not such good time for a meeting . JOE : What 's the source ? Where 's the epicenter ? TAKASHI : We don 't know . But it keeps getting stronger . It 's gotta be centered somewhere . Hayato . No one else is reporting it . We are contacting every other plant in the Kanté region . Tékai , Fujiyama . They 're unaffected . But my guess is these readings are just aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake . Are we at full function ? Yes , we are . But perhaps we should be drawing down , to be safe . [ RUMBLING ] Take us offline . - Now , Joe- - JOE : Do it ! Now . Wind it down . [ SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ] Sandra . Sandra , are you there ? [ WALLS SHUDDERING ] We 're turning back . Let 's go . Oh , my God . Joe , are you there ? Joe , there 's been a breach . We 're heading back to the containment seal . Listen . You need to get out of there . If there 's been a reactor breach , you won 't last five minutes with or without the suits . Do you hear me ? I hear you . We 're coming ! [ SHOUTING IN JAPANESE ] JOE : I 'll meet them there myself . Put the safety doors on manual override . TAKASHI : I cannot do that ! JOE : Keep the doors open . My wife is still in there ! [ PANTING ] SANDRA : Come on let 's go ! [ PANTING ] Tell me this door 's on manual . TAKASHI : Yeah . But we are starting to breach ! I 'm here . Soon as they 're through , I 'll seal it .

[ KETTLE WHISTLING ] [ WHISTLING STOPS ] Your mom 's out there , Ford . To me she 'll always be there . They evacuated us so quickly . I don 't even have a picture of her . This has to stop .

I came back here and wasted six years staring through that barbed wire , thinking it was a military mistake or some horrible design flaw they were covering up . [ SIGHS ] One day I met a guy who runs a cargo boat offshore . Every day he goes right past the reactor site . So he places a couple frequency monitors on buoys for me . Two weeks ago ... I check this thing like every other day just for the kick . Two weeks ago , I 'm tuning in and , oh , my God there it is . Whatever " it " is that 's in there . Whatever it is they 're guarding so carefully started talking again . And I mean talking . Ha , ha . I have to go back to our house . I need my old disks , if they 're still there .

[ SERIZAWA SIGHS ] GRAHAM : All these items they were found on him . - And the date . Look , 15 years ago . SERIZAWA : I thought all of the data from that day was lost . I guess not . [ PULSATING ] JOE : You see ? You see ? There it is again . That is not a transformer malfunction . That is an electromagnetic pulse . It affects everything electrical for miles and miles and it is happening again . This is what caused everything in the first place . Don 't you see that ? And it is gonna send us back to the Stone Age . You have no idea what 's coming . [ RUMBLING AND RATTLING ] [ ALARM BLARING ] Pulses are seconds apart . They 're getting stronger .

STENZ : This is our needle in a haystack , people . MUTO . Massive unidentified terrestrial organism . It is , however , no longer terrestrial . It is airborne . The world still thinks this was an earthquake and it would be preferable that that remain so . Before we lost sight , it was headed east across the Pacific and had emitted enough EMP disruption to create havoc with our radar and satellite feeds and reduce us , for the moment , to a strictly visual pursuit . I emphasize " for the moment " because we will get on our game and we will find this thing . It is imperative that we do so . Captain , I want any and all search options on this table ASAP . - Yes , sir . STENZ : Dr. Serizawa . Admiral William Stenz . SERIZAWA : Nice to meet you . - Glad to have you on board . GRAHAM : Sensei . SERIZAWA : Excuse me . MAN [ OVER TV ] : Authorities issued a statement ... GRAHAM : Brady 's dead . ... claiming the nuclear contamination is at no risk of spreading , even as the death toll rises . [ KNOCKING ] Lieutenant Brody ? MAN : Dr. Serizawa . My condolences . We are deeply sorry for your loss , lieutenant . But I 'm afraid we need your help . MAN [ ON FILM ] : This is the USS Nautilus . SERIZAWA : In 1954 the first time a nuclear submarine ever reached the lower depths it awakened something . GRAHAM : The Americans first thought that it was the Russians . The Russians thought that it was them . All those nuclear bomb tests in the ' 50s ... ? Not tests . SERIZAWA : They were trying to kill it . Him . - An ancient alpha predator . GRAHAM : Millions of years older than mankind . From an age when the Earth was 10 times more radioactive than today . This animal and others like it consumed this radiation as a food source . As the levels on the surface naturally subsided these creatures adapted to live deeper in the oceans . Further underground . Absorbing radiation from the planet 's core . The organization we work for , Monarch , was established in the wake of this discovery . A multinational coalition formed in secrecy to search for him . Study him . Learn everything we could . We call him Gojira . GRAHAM : The top of a primordial ecosystem . A god , for all intents and purposes . - A monster . SERIZAWA : Fifteen years ago we found a fossil of another giant animal in the Philippines . Like Gojira . But this creature died long ago . Killed by these . GRAHAM : Parasitic spores . One dormant . But the other hatched . Catalyzed when a mining company unknowingly drilled into its tomb . The hatchling burrowed straight for the nearest source of radiation your father 's power plant in Janjira and cocooned there for 15 years , absorbing its radioactive fuel to gestate , to grow . SERIZAWA : Until it hatched like a butterfly into the creature you saw today . Wait . You knew about this ? This thing ? The whole time ? Why didn 't you kill it when you had the chance ? GRAHAM : It was absorbing radiation from the reactors . We worried killing it might release that radiation and endanger millions . SERIZAWA : That 's why our mission was to contain it . To study its biology , to understand it . GRAHAM : We knew the creature was having an electrical effect on everything within a close proximity . What we didn 't know was that it could harness this same power in an EMP attack . But your father did . He predicted it . SERIZAWA : What else did he say ? GRAHAM : Please try to remember , Mr. Brody . Anything that would help us . Anything at all . I didn 't listen . I just thought he was crazy . He was obsessed with all this ... [ SIGHS ] Said something about an animal call . Something talking . SERIZAWA : Talking ? FORD : He said he was studying something . Echolocation . If the MUTO was talking that day your father must have discovered something talking back . - Check again . - Yup . Search for a response call . FORD : This parasite . It 's still out there . Where 's it headed ? SERIZAWA : The MUTO is young ... - --9l ' 0Wing _ it will be looking for food . Sources of radiation . We 're monitoring all known sites but if we don 't find it soon- - Then what ? Nature has an order . A power to restore balance . I believe he is that power . MAN : Sir , right now we 're 5O miles from Hawaii . This transport will take you there . You 're catching a commercial flight back to San Francisco .

Everything not tied down is moving east . - Whoa , is that where they 're heading ? - Yeah . I guess we 're monster hunters now . WOMAN : Satellite transfer complete . Simulations uploaded . Satellite tracking continues . Last satellite tracks predict the MUTO continuing due east . All our models have the targets converging on the Pacific Coast . As of now , it looks like Godzilla 's still following the MUTO . He 's hunting . Have all vessels maintain current distance from target . And plot the speed and heading of these things . I wanna know exactly when and where they 'll make landfall . MAN : Yes , sir . Doctor , what did you mean by " hunting " ? You think it 's chasing this MUTO ' ? But if the MUTO is his prey ... The signal shows a call . - Why call up a predator ? SERIZAWA : No , it didn 't . I think Godzilla was only listening . The MUTO was calling something else . The pattern . Focus the search on Nevada . Nevada ? Why would it go to Nevada ? - It can 't be . It 's impossible . - What 's impossible ? There was another spore , intact , found in the Philippine mine . But we vivisected it . Ran every test on it for years . You confirmed it for yourself . It was dormant ! Maybe not anymore . This spore . Where is it now , doctor ? It was highly radioactive . It was disposed of . The Americans , they took it . STENZ : Doctor , where is it ? Where you put all your nuclear waste . Go , go , go ! MAN : Right , let 's go !

[ BANGING ON DOOR ] MAN : Captain , our UA Vs have footage of the new MUTO . STENZ : Let 's have a look . MAN : Yes , sir . This is from five minutes ago . STE NZ : My God . MAN : Playing all we have now . It 's almost 300 feet . It 's far bigger than the other one . But this one doesn 't have any wings . A different sex ? A female . GRAHAM : That 's who he 's been talking to . SERIZAWA : It must be a mating call . The female remained dormant until the male matured . GRAHAM : Now they 're seeking radiation . To reproduce . Current tracking models indicate that all three targets are converging here : San Francisco Bay . But if we rig a nuclear warhead with a shielded timer put it on a boat and send it 2O miles out the radiation lures the MUTOs and the MUTOs lure Godzilla . And we detonate , with minimal fallout risk to the city . You can 't be serious . They feed on radiation . Correct . That 's why we use the bomb as bait . MAN : And kill them with the sheer force of the blast . GRAHAM : This is crazy . Doctor , if you have any other ideas , I am all ears . SERIZAWA : Admiral . STE NZ : Yes , doctor ?

But I am sacrificing lives every minute trying to steer one of these things clear of population centers and now there are two more on the way . There are millions of lives at risk . So all I want to know from you is : Will it work and can they be killed ? SERIZAWA : But we tried that before . We 're talking dialable yield . Megatons , not kilotons . Nothing can withstand that blast . Makes the bomb we tried to kill it with in ' 54 look like a firecracker . [ TRAIN HORN BLOWING ] FORD : Sergeant Morales .

I 'm sure your wife is fine . [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] MAN : Lieutenant Brody ! I 'm looking for Lieutenant Brody . - Are you Brody ? - Yes . Okay . The male delivered the warhead to the center of downtown . That puts 100,000 civilians in the blast radius . We can 't stop it remotely . An analog timer has been installed . The MUTOs are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble . Means approaching from ground is not an option . That 's why we 'll be conducting a HALO insertion . Jumping altitude Will be 30,000 feet . We just skate to the top and drop . Here . And here . If you don 't hit a skyscraper on the way , meet at rally point Charlie . - Right here . Good ? - Doctor , any guesses where to look ? SERIZAWA : Underground . If the MUTOs have spawned they 'll be building a nest . Captain , when you find the warhead how long to disarm it ? - Without seeing the analog mod , I couldn 't even guess . FORD : Sixty seconds if I can access it . I retrofitted that device myself . CAPTAIN : Lieutenant Brody is our only EOD tech to survive the train attack . Well , it sounds like we could use you . With all due respect if that doesn 't work , then what 's Plan B ? - The waterfront is located one klick downhill . Get the bomb to the pier , onto a boat and as far away from the city as possible before it detonates . Any questions ? - Dismissed . - That 's it . Let 's move . Lieutenant ? They 've already been briefed . We have no extraction plan . If you don 't walk out , you don 't come back at all . Sir , I 'll do whatever it takes . This alpha predator of yours , doctor do you really think he has a chance ? The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around . Let them fight .

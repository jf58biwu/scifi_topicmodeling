HE PULLED THOUGHTS OUT OF MY HEAD LIKE CARDS OUT OF A DECK . WHAT DID HE GET FROM YOU ? HE DID GET AN IMAGE OF YOU . BUT AT THIS POINT YOU 'RE AS MUCH A FUGITIVE AS THE REST OF US , SO , UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF A REASON WHY THAT WOULD HURT US- - DID HE GIVE ANY INDICATION THAT HE PULLED ANYTHING ELSE ? NO . I DID WHAT I 'M SUPPOSED TO DO , KEEP A BUNCH OF RANDOM THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD , BUT THEN HE KNEW I WAS DOING THAT TOO , SO I JUST GOT OUT OF THERE . THESE GUYS , THEY OUT-MOVE US , THEY OUT-THINK US .

YOU WEAR IT . YOU PUT IT AROUND YOUR NECK . HE IS A FUGITIVE . WHY PUT ONESELF AT RISK IN THIS QUADRANT FOR SOMETHING SO UNEXCEPTIONAL ? THESE FUGITIVES ARE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO WALK FREELY . I THINK THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION . THE RESISTANCE IS PROTECTING THEM . YOU MEAN THEYE BEING TIPPED OFF ? TO OUR MOVEMENTS , YES . TWO DAYS AGO , ONE OF THE MEN IN YOUR DIVISION FAILED A SECURITY TEST . I BELIEVE HE IS WITH THE RESISTANCE . I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUGITIVES THROUGH HIM . WHY DIDN 'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE SECURITY FAIL ? I COULD ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION . I DIDN 'T KNOW ABOUT IT . THAT IS MY POINT . I 'LL LOOK INTO IT . WELCOME TO TAPE TWO OF MY PLAN TO DEFEAT THE OBSERVERS . BEFORE WE BEGIN , FIRST AND FOREMOST , YOU MUST ACCEPT THE REVERSIBILITY OF ALL PHENOMENA ... PARTICLES HAVE THEIR SPEEDS REVERSED , THEN THE CHANGES- - FOUND A MEASURABLE EFFECT . LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR- - UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS , WE WILL NOT BE FIGHTING IN THE SAME FIELD . THESE ARE THE PLANS THAT WE MUST FOLLOW TO THE LETTER- - IMPERATIVE THAT THESE PLANS BE RETRIEVED . ( Olivia ) ASTRID , IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT HE 'S TALKING ABOUT . THIS IS AS CLEAR AS I CAN GET IT . I HAVE HIDDEN THEM AS I WOULD MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION . FUNNY STORY ACTUALLY . WHEN I WAS A BOY , MY MOTHER WOULD TAKE ME ON WHAT SHE CALLED MANHATTAN MYSTERY TOURS . WE WOULD CATCH THE FIRST TRAIN THAT CAME TO THE STATION , AND THEN WE WOULD VENTURE INTO THE CITY ... [ repeating ] AND GET OFF AT THE FIRST- - I 'LL NEVER FORGET- - INSPIRATIONAL . [ winding sound ] [ tape ejects ] ( Astrid ) THE TAPE IS RIPPED . IT GOT CAUGHT ON A FLECK OF AMBER . I 'VE HEARD ENOUGH . I KNOW WHERE THE TUBE IS . YOU DO ? MM. THE SUBWAY PLATFORM BENEATH NEWARK PENN STATION IN THE WALL . ( Astrid ) HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ? ( Walter ) BECAUSE , AS A BOY , MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION WAS MY COLLECTION OF DETECTIVE COMICS . AND , LIKE EVERYONE , I WAS TERRIFIED THAT THE PINKOS WOULD ATTACK . SO I THOUGHT THAT A SUBWAY PLATFORM WOULD BE THE SAFEST PLACE TO HIDE THEM . BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERGROUND . I WAS TEN . AND THAT 'S WHERE YOU HID THE PLANS ? YES . UNDER NEWARK PENN STATION ? I AM SURE OF IT . EVERY MAJOR ACCESS POINT TO MANHATTAN HAS AN OBSERVER CHECKPOINT . THAT INCLUDES TRAIN STATIONS . ( Olivia ) OKAY , WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE GUARDS . ARE THEY OBSERVERS OR LOYALISTS ? ( both ) BOTH . ( Etta ) I DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF WE CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO EFFECTIVELY TE THEM OUT WITHOUT BEING TEED . WELL , WE NEED TO CREATE A DIVERSION . I THINK WE 'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE THAN A DIVERSION . TER . I 'M GOING TO WANT TO GET TO THAT ROLLING CABINET IN THE AMBER . WALTER , THERE 'S NOTHING IN THERE EXCEPT LAB EQUIPMENT AND YOUR EASY-BAKE OVEN . I 'M NOT AFTER WHAT 'S IN IT . IT 'S WHAT 'S UNDER IT . ASTRIF ... PREPARE THE LASER .

ALL OF YOU . IT 'S MENOLATUM . NOT AS BAD AS I TUG . WALTER , IS THIS WHAT I THINK THIS IS ? MY COLD STORAGE OF ALL THE FRINGE EVENTS WE EVER ENCOUNTERED , DORMANT FOR 21 YEARS . IF WE 'RE GOING TO FIND A DIVERSION TO GET INTO THE RAILWAY STATION , WE 'LL FIND IT HERE . WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST , WALTER ? THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE SOLVED FRINGE CASES . NOW I THINK IT 'S TIME WE CREATED A FEW OF OUR OWN . SO THIS IS EVERY FRINGE EVENT ? ( Walter ) DOCUMENTED AND PRESERVED TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY . OH , LOOK , OLIVIA , MY PORCUPINE MAN . YOU REALLY HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ANY OF THIS ? I WOULDN 'T HAVE SLEPT AT NIGHT IF I DID . ( Walter ) SOME SECRETS ARE MEANT TO BE KEPT . FOR TWO REASONS- - NUMBER ONE : BECAUSE THEY 'RE MINE . AND NUMBER TWO : I HAVE A HEALTHY DISTRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT . THESE ITEMS WERE SAFER WITH ME . OH ! PUT THAT DOWN . YOU 'LL AMBER US .

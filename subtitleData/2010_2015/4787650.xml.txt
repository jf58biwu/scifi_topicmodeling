 KAYDARA I 'm The One of human kind . When will you stop believing in these inanities ? The One , as you call him , is our enemy . If he exists and if we cross path , I will have to kill him . You know it . Believe me , little brother , you are better off as you are . Go watch your monitor , I have a bad feeling . And take-off this ridiculous costume ! The reparations are terminated . Every energy generator are operational . We are ready for take off , Captain . - Perfect ! Iad ! We should not hang out about this sector . Hurry up ! Steel , at your station , June , update ! 65 % of our stock is still operational . On the other hand , we didn 't get much from the smashed ship wreck , the munitions were half destroyed . As for rest , we are ready to take off Captain . It won 't be him who will cure your disability . You see , little brother , every man has a demon within , that ruins his life . The worst thing would be not realize it , or even worse , be cowardly to accept it , and remain a slave , lobotomized by this shitty Artificial Intelligence ( " A.I. " ) . You think you 're superior ? The One is an idol , he does not exist . I 've an endless love for mankind , because I belive in ' em . Everyone has a force , you only need to realize it , to develop it . That 's why we believing in a divine power doesn 't make sense , or worse , it means , there is a danger that every believer can 't truly see himself . The One , if he exists , cannot be different from us . Yes , if I believe in myself , I have the ability to acces a force as powerful as the force of the One . If you 're as strong as him , you can bend this spoon simply by looking at it ? The only person who should bend this spoon , it 's you , litle brother . Hologramm ! Find us a hideout ! The computer is analysing the zone . The empty frame of a building . Perfect ! Set up the landing ! Phantom mode ! What does the computer tell us ? - No information for now . Shit , I think we 've been spotted , it 's coming toward us ! Straight ahead ! But , what is it ? ! Iad . Don 't be afraid . Kaydara ! We meet again ... The romantic bounty-hounter . Dante ! It 's been a long time , I thought you were dead . As talkative as ever ... For your information , the reward for the killing of the Chosen one , has doubled . As a result , every other contestant is just an annoying obstacle . You understand . Have no fear , I do not consider you and your disabled brother , as serious contestants at all . What does h√• say ? Why is he laughing ? So farewell ! Goodbye ... Get ready to start the reactors at full power . He 's chucking missile at us ! Six missiles ! Impact in fifteen seconds ! Go on ! Iad ! Engage ! The eingine at full power ! Iad ? Full power ! Shit , he 's chasing us ! We 're waiting for your orders . - Captain ? Cannons ready to fire ! - At your orders . Their firing strenght is superior to ours ! We 're doing badly , he 's going to kill us ! Trajectory in the zone 5 tunnels . Too narrow , it 's madness ! Do it ! Shit , 3 missiles at our back ! Kayd ? We 're trapped , we have to surrender . Kayd . Kaydara , what are you doing ? RANUGAL No ! No ! You are not going to do that ? But why are you closing the cockpit ? We are going to get destroyed ! Kaydara ... ! Tell me , what 's the damages ? The back seems to be holding for now . What about the door in the cockpit ? Shit , it is worse . The hull is still burning ! Shit ! The back just dropped off ! Fuck ! I 'm sorry , Captain , the main cannons are destroyed ! Give me your spoon ! Please , Iad . Kayd , but what are you doing ? Are you mad ? All we are going to die ! Shit , what is this mess ? Gett out ... Unknown aircraft detected in vicinity And who is this child ? The only survivor . Here , here is your spoon . How is that possible ? SYSTEM UNDER SURVEILLANCE anomaly detected analysing code CODE ERROR Pull yourself together , there is something wrong . The code is not normal . I have never seen that . - It 's him ! It 's the One ! Locate the source and prepare the transfer . Appolo street located , in the top floors of a disused building . Be careful . It 's going to be bad . Shit , agents are here . In me , it 's not far . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agents , Kayd ! They 've found you , they 're coming ! Get out of there , right now ! Careful , there 're some left in the room on your right , behind the window panes ! Iad , direct me , please ! There are only 3 left , 2 are on other side of the counter . The agent with his back at you is isolated . Iad ! Help me ! Guide me ! Go straight ahead . He hasn 't moved , he 's loading his gun . Perfect . Iad , stop all your bullshit ! The cell is being watching for sure . It 's not a good idea to hang around here too long . Tell me if you detect his presence in the building . He 's going towards the basement , at the same level as the undergound . But we have a big problem . Other agents are coming down , a lot of them now . The entire building , it 's now ... ... filled every level . It 's impossible ... ... to go down ... I can see the agents for you . Iad , relax , I think I 've found one . Superman ! The alteration of the code surrounding me looks like the one we observed earlier on the computer . I can see it here , with my own eyes . One day or another , I wish to see you too such a sight , without the aid of a machine to decipher the code . I told you , everyone has the power . Ok , now we must be vigilant and stay focused . I 'am in the gallery , direct me , will you . Iad ! Wait , the computer is analysing the Metro maps . Ok , at the end of the gallery , there is a small corridor , that will lead you to a room . That 's where he is . Ok , I am here . Jesus Christ ! I detect 3 agent with him . No ! Another , two ! One ! He is faster than you . There is only one left now ! It 's the One ! Kaydara ! Kaydara ! Are you all right , Kayd ? Kayd ? Leave it , Keydara , he 's too strong for you . We need to get you out of there . Kaydara ? Can you hear me ? What are you doing ? Kaydara ? Kaydara , stop it ! I beg you . Don 't do this . He 's going to kill you . Kaydara ! Kaydara , can you hear me ? Kayd ? Are you all right ? Clever little brother . He walked right into the trap . ACTIVE VIRUS Please , Kaydara , he doesn 't deserve to die like this . Take off this shit first . The One must die . It 's inevitable yet . But ? Ok , take it off . Uninstall it fully ! DANGER ANOMALY DETECTED No , forgive him . He doesn 't know what 's he doing . Plug me back in , Iad , Plug me back in , Iad , please . Plug me back in . Please , plug me . Iad . Plug me back in . Plug ... me ... back ... in ... Does it sting ? Don 't be afraid . Text correctures and timing : Asen Zlatarev and John Atanasov

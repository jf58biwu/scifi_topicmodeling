 ¶ two ... Two , three ... ¶ ¶ ( whirring ) ( whooshing ) ( bender laughing ) ( whooping ) Remember this place , leela ? Yep . The moon . It 's been here for quite a while . Yeah , but it 's also where we came On our very first delivery together ! Oh , right . Man , we sure used to try harder back then . ( jazzy music playing ) Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture ! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come ! One leela , please . And , uh , use your finest balloons . Wow , you 're good . Five years of art school . ( chuckles ) ( sobs ) ( pained grunt ) Want a corndog ? Sure . Then your mom should have bought you one . ( laughs ) ( munching ) Ooh , fancy ! Ride operator : Hold tight ! The mecha-hexadecapus is about To flail erratically into action ! ( all gasping , yelling ) Whoa ... Oh , yeah ... Oh ... You know , I 'm feeling a little ... ( vomits ) ( leela screams ) Leela ! ( air whooshing ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( sobbing ) : Poor leela ! I never even told her I loved her ! What ? ! You told her , like , a 140 times ! Yeah , but she paid very little attention to me . Oh , bender ! I always thought me and her would grow old together ! ( imitates buzzer ) You gotta live in the moment , baby ! And in this moment , leela 's dead . ( door opens ) Sir , we have some good news and some bad news . The good news is , we found your stuffed animal . What 's the bad news ? Your wife is dead . She wasn 't my wife ! Oh ! Then there is no bad news . ( sobbing ) ( gasps ) ( groaning , gasping ) Leela ! You 're alive ! ( grunts ) She gave her life to save mine . ( knocking on door ) Fry : Bender , can I come in and talk ? I 'm kinda busy . Seeing leela fly off the hexadecapus And crash through the moon dome and survive Inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon Was a dose of reality . ( sing-songy ) : Come in ... All this time , I 've been wondering If I can spend my life with her . But what I realize now is , I can 't spend my life without her . So , tomorrow , I 'm asking her to marry me . Uh-huh . Good talk . We 're done here . ( sniffles ) My little meatbag 's growing up . Computer , jamaican joy juice , hot ! ( slurping ) G. N. , e . ! Behold the time button , a pocket-sized device that sends The entire universe ten seconds into the past ! I will now demonstrate . ( trills , whooshes ) Joy juice , hot . Pretty cool , eh ? I 'm over here where I was ten seconds ago . Something 's cool ? Show it to us ! Whuh ? Oh , right . You were outside the button ball , So you don 't remember a thing I said . Let 's try again , but this time , Everyone cram into my time shelter . ( all murmur with awe ) ooh , nice ! It 's coated with antichroniton-resistant grout To shield you from the effects of the button . Come on . Get in . Hurry up . ( electrical buzzing ) Friends , I found a ten dollars ! Ten dollars , you say ? Let me see . It fell off a man . The man got into a taxi , but the money did not . Friends , I found a ten dollars ! You found some money ? Show me . ( groans ) Say , check out the money I found . It fell off a chump ! ( laughs ) ( applause ) Hey , professor , couldn 't you go back in time as far as you want By pressing the button over and over ? Certainly not ! Each time the button sends you back ten seconds , It takes ten seconds to recharge . ( beeps ) There , it 's recharged . ( groans ) Again , again ! Uh , question ? What if you had a special moment That you wished could go on forever ? Could the time button make it last as long as you wanted ? Hell , no ! This button is for scientific use only . ( beeps ) ( groans ) Uh , yes , I 'd like an engagement diamond , please ? You come to the right joint , ace . I 'll take ... This one . Classy choice , chief . She 'll crap her pants . ( grunting ) That 'll be five bills . Hey , give me back my stones ! Hello , stranger . This is my first time here . Do you sell diamonds ? You come to the right joint , ace . ( both chuckle ) I guess what I 'm saying is , the next time you almost die , I want it to be as my wife . ( gasps ) The clam , elzar . Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am ! ( sniffles ) fry ... ? Wow ... Leela , my love , will you ... ? ( screaming ) I 'll have what she 's having . ( screaming ) Oh , god ! I ruined everything ! I blew my one chance to ... Hey , wait a second ! Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am ! ( sniffles ) fry ... ? Wait ! Allow me . Leela , my love , will you marry me ? Oh , my gosh ! This is all so sudden ... After 13 years . Don 't answer yet ! I want this to be a special moment , So I rented the roof garden on top of the tallest building In new new york . The vampire state building ? Uh-huh . If your answer 's yes , Be there tonight at 6 : 30 , half hour before sunset . And if my answer 's no ? Then just don 't show up . I 'll get the message . ( coughs ) Big night , eh , mr . Fry ? The biggest , janos . Check this out . What is that ? Some kind of time button ? Exactly . If she says yes , I 'll use it To make the sunset last as long as we want . Strange things happen when the shadows lengthen . Woman ( over p.A. ) : Janitor to the 237th floor men 's room . Six o 'clock . She 'll be here in half an hour . ( beeps ) 6 : 30 ? Maybe she 's stuck in slow traffic . I know she 'll come . I know it . I really thought she was gonna come . ( sniffles ) I traveled a thousand years forward in time , But without leela , I have no future . ( grunts ) This is the end . ( sniffles ) Good-bye , my love . ( grunts ) Leela ? ! Hey ! It 's only 6 : 25 ! So why does my watch say 7 : 03 ? ! Of course ! My watch is fast 'cause it kept running Every time I hit the button ! So leela 's actually on time ! Hi , leela ! Fry ! It 's okay , I 'm gonna die happy ! No , wait ! I 'll go back ten seconds Till when I was on the roof ! Rats . Guess I was falling For more than ten seconds . Hi , leela ! Fry ! Everything 's cool ! Wait a second . There 's no possible way out of this situation ! Help , help ... ! Fry ! I 'm stuck in a loop ! This isn 't the moment I wanted to last forever ! Careful . This is the most valuable thing we 've ever delivered . Oop ! ( guttural scream ) Careful . This is the most ... Quickly ! Into the time shelter ! ( each grunts as they enter ) Someone stole the time button , And they 're pressing it every ten seconds ! The universe is caught in a time loop ! Then let 's go out and stop them ! Are you mad ? ! Because that would make two of us . Ugh ! You 're right . We 'd never get anywhere . We 'd just keep jumping back to where we started . Also , we 'd die horribly ! You see , we 're shielded in here . So if we leave the time shelter And the button gets pressed less than ten seconds later , The antichronitons wouldn 't know where to send us back to ! We 'd be shredded across the time-space continuum Like human coleslaw ! Yum ! Observe . Aw ... Listen , I know who stole the button . I wasn 't gonna tell , 'cause I don 't like being helpful . But I do like ratting people out , So ... It was fry ! ( all gasp ) He took it to the vampire state building . We 've got to get to him . But how ? We can 't leave the time shelter . Hooray ! I 'm trapped in a tiny fun room with friends ! ( bird screeching ) ( bird screeching ) Man , falling from a great height An infinite number of times can be stressful . At least I have leela 's comforting scream To look forward to . Fry ! ( yawns ) ( snoring ) Leela : Fry ! Whuh ? ( screams ) ( bird screeching ) Professor : Hurry , hurry , hurry , Hurry , hurry , stop ! Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry ... Hurry , hurry , hurry ... ¶ my boyfriend gave me a diamond ... ¶ Hurry , hurry , hurry ... Oh ! Fry ! We 're here to rescue you ! ( snores , gasps ) professor ? Oops . ( gasps , whimpers ) Fry ! Professor ? ( fry screaming ) He 's ... He 's dead . It does look that way . My poor sweet puddle ! ( gasps ) the button ! I can still save him ! No , don 't ! You 'll shred me into a zillion ... It worked ! Hermes : But you killed the professor ! Yeah , but it worked ! ( gasps , grunts ) I died . I 'm dead ! I 'm gonna die ! Come on , come on . Fry , what 's happening ? Did you fall off the building ? Actually , that 's kind of a funny story ... He sure has a lot of blood for a skinny guy . ( bird screeching ) And I didn 't want to go on living without you , So I jumped , and , well ... Oh ... That 's so sweet , fry . ( sighs ) You know those dreams where you 're falling , And right before you hit the ground you wake up ? Those are great . If only there were a way to make fry land softly , This would all be over . Ooh , I know ! My airbag ! Leela ! I 'm coming to save the day ! Hang on , fry ! You 're just one death away from being saved ! And then we can be marry me ? Okay , I 'm gonna run out there . Then , you guys form a human bus And crash into me at 40 miles an hour . Ready ? Go ! ( panting ) ( grunts ) We did it ! ( whoops ) ( cheering ) Wh-what happened ? Did I break the button ? I think you broke the universe . Everything but us is frozen . What are we gonna do ? First , I 'm gonna get back these earrings I loaned amy three years ago . After that , I don 't know . This is surreal . Whatever we want is ours for the taking . ( echoing ) : Hello ? Anyone ? ( hollow knocking ) I guess it 's just us for all eternity . Listen , leela , I 'm not sure what kind of life We can make together in this frozen time-sicle , But if it 's not too weird ... Will you still marry me ? I would marry you even if You weren 't the last man on earth . ( gasps ) ( gasps ) What was that ? I don 't know ... But I 'm scared . Well , maybe we just need some rest . We can get married in the morning . Except there won 't be morning . We can worry about that in the morning . ( grunting ) ( cracking ) Do I , philip j . Fry , Take you , turanga leela , To be my lawful wedded wife ? You do . Do I , turanga leela , Take you , philip j . Fry , To be my lawful wedded husband ? Uh ... Yes ? Absolutely . ( urgent grunting ) There it is again ! Leave my wife alone , you glimmer ! It 's okay , fry . If it keeps bugging us , We 'll either kill it or adopt it . Meanwhile , what do you say we get started On a very , very , very long honeymoon ? ¶ ¶ ¶ ( both grunting with effort ) I think it 's about time We drank the champagne Janos poured all those years ago . May I read the toast I was going to make ? Go for it . I 'm in no rush , After walking up 240 flights of steps . And across those oceans . " to us . " if I could make one moment last forever , This is the one I would choose . " I 'm glad you did . It was a good life . Kind of lonely , though ? Maybe ? I was never lonely . Not even for a minute . I guess we 'll never figure out what that glimmer is . Nope . Pretty , though . Hey , hey , wait ... It 's doing something ! ( groans ) I 'll protect you . Hi ... Yow ! Professor ? ! You 're alive ? ! Yes , it 's me . Boy , did somebody hit you two With an old-and - ugly-stick . I thought I killed you with the time button . I thought so , too , at first . But it seems I was simply rotated Into an orthogonal time That runs at right angles to this one . I 've been tunneling for decades , Searching every instant from yesterday to tomorrow . We 've been right now the whole time . I wasn 't looking for you , I was looking for the time button . ( grunts ) Oh ! I landed on it and time froze . I tried to fix it once , But then I got mad and hit it some more . I guess it 's good we didn 't have children . Oh , give me that , you senile old idiot ! Oh , let me see ... That goes there ... Lefty loosey , righty tighty , And ... Fixed ! What ? ! I could 've fixed it that easily ? You ? ( giddy laughter ) Okay . I 've modded the device to release A single huge antichroniton blast . It should rip us out of stasis , Back to the instant before I conceived of the time button . You mean we 'll all get to live our lives over again ? Oh , my , yes . Even that nasty robot , what 's-his-name . Of course , we won 't remember anything that 's happened . What do you say ? Want to go around again ? I do .

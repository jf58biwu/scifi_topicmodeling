 Previously on Defiance ... Come here . The poison was on the flask . When Kenya comes back , she might need to find herself another job . You need to prepare yourself for the fact ... She 's coming back . She is coming back . I know her . Hello ? I 'm the man holding a gun to your little sister 's head . Someone 's trying to extort Amanda . Claims to be holding Kenya prisoner . And you believe that ? Amanda ? Kenya ? The first thing that I remember is the darkness . And then there was a motor hum . And I could hear these whispers . Can you speak ? I 'm thirsty . Here 's some water . I got six , seven , eight Did you see anyone else ? No . I just saw the man with the goggles . Did he talk at all about the plot against New York ? He talked about it in bits and pieces . He asked me a lot of questions . Do you remember your sister ? Of course I remember my sister . What 's your sister 's name ? Her name is ... Her name is " Go chup yourself . " This went on for a long time . He wanted to know about my life in Defiance . Where did you come from ? I don 't know . How old are you ? I don 't know ! What 's your mother 's name ? I don 't know ! And then one day , he surprises me . Amanda Rosewater ? Free Mahsuvus Gorath from Earth Republic custody or your sister dies . Disobey us and she dies . I 'm the man holding a gun to your little sister 's head . Amanda ? Don 't do anything this son of a bitch says ! Okay . So the rest , you pretty much know . He used me to blackmail Amanda . I ... I tried to escape . And then ... And here I am . I 'm home . How long would you say that our friend with the goggles kept you prisoner ? Two or three weeks , at the most . What ? Well , you disappeared a year ago . So , what happened to all the rest of the time you were missing ? What 's your last memory in Defiance ? The night Amanda lost the election . I hugged you to say goodbye . And then we said ... And then ? And then ? Goodbye and then ... And ... And then ? I don 't know . She 's suffered damage to the medial temporal lobe . Well , she 's gonna have to try harder . Stop pushing her . The missing memories could come flooding back or they could slip away further . Can we stop for tonight ? I 'm just so tired . I have more questions for her . We 'll finish in the morning . I 'll need to see her again tomorrow . You waiting for a lollipop ? You got a habit of playing fast and loose with the truth . I haven 't forgotten that . Meaning ? No games . No jokes . I 'll look after her . A drink , Favi Tarr ? No , thank you . I 'm here for my envelope . I gave it to Alak at work this morning . You work for Alak ? He hired me at Raider Radio . You might recognize my voice . " Hello , Defiance , this is Treasure Doll " playing the records your mother warned you about . " Hiring a prostitute to talk on the radio is very imaginative . I must compliment Alak when I see him . That 's Kenya . Excuse me ? Coming in the door with Amanda . That 's Kenya Rosewater . Kenya Rosewater is ... Hi ! No . Not possible . What 's going on ? So now I 'm , hey I said hey , I said I said hey What 's going on ? So now , hey ... I said hey What 's going on ? I 'm so glad you 're home . I 'm so glad to be back . I thought I drove you away . Yeah ? Did I ? Drove me away ? I mean , was I too controlling ? Too suffocating ? Too ... You 're always too controlling . But that 's not why I left . I don 't know why I left . But what I do know is that you kept this place going . You kept my digbaa tree alive . You kept me alive . Thank you . I 'm gonna go downstairs and close up . Amanda ? Can you sleep next to me ? Okay . It 'll be like when we built forts out of oil drums . Oh . And we fell asleep , listening to the gunfire . All night long . Do you remember ? Mom was so mad . She was so mad . But we had each other . Didn 't we ? We still do . You 're where ? Helping Sukar . He okay ? He 's sick . Right now , we ought to be a little more worried about you . It 's Sukar , Nolan . He needs my help . All right . All right . Okay , kiddo . I 'm okay . I promise . Be careful . I will . He will not come ? No . The pilgrimage can 't be interrupted . It 's Irzu 's will . Find anything else interesting while I was gone ? I 'm only here because my CO ordered me to help you . I 'm not interested in conversation . Aw , gee , Tommy , you got something on your mind . Why don 't you spit it out ? No . Come on . I 'm not taking the bait . Sure you will , sooner or later . It 's inevitable . I 'm not playing . Understood . You know , Tommy , Berlin 's a big girl . She has a right to choose who she sleeps with . You actually have no shame . No . And in this case , she chose me . Now , I know that 's not what you want to hear , Tommy . But I thought I 'd give you a fair warning . I like you . You 're a good ... I am not a kid ! Sure punch like one . - Would you like another ? - No . Thank you . That one there , I had coming . You punch me a second time , I 'm gonna have to hit you back , and neither of us wants that , do we ? And you wonder why Irisa is avoiding you . Kenya . What a lovely surprise . It 's so good to see you . Oh , even your Casti perfume still smells good . That 's something I do remember . Something wrong with your memory ? There is . But when I saw you last night at the NeedWant and you were staring at me , I just had this sense of d√©ja vu . Was there something between us ? You could say that , yes . Well , I 'm sure it 'll all come back to me soon . Oh , I certainly hope so . And when it does , we 're gonna have a proper reunion . We found this stuff in the car . Anything there ring a bell ? Can I touch it ? Of course . Go feel it . It 's really good to have you back around here . Is it good for you ? So , I 'm guessing you remember we dated ? Yeah . I do . And maybe also remember we broke up ? Not specifically . But wait , I remember talking to Amanda about it afterwards . Yeah . So , your sister and I started seeing each other while you were missing . It wasn 't anything too serious . It 's sort of over for now , but I thought you should know . Thank you . Okay . Okay . Yeah , I remember this hammer . I can see some man from the Votanis Collective . And he used this hammer to free me from ... Free you from where ? I 'm floating in water . - Get down ! - Shut up . There were other people there . Beside me . Humans . No ! V.C. soldiers killed them . And then the man with the goggles said , " Stop . Don 't shoot her . " Why not ? This is Amanda Rosewater 's sister . We can use her . Find me a sedative . No ! No , don 't do that . No , no , no , no , no , no . Hey , hey ! No , no , I can 't . I can 't . I can 't . They 're all coming back . It 's so horrible . Hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey . It 's all coming back . It 's okay . I just want you to think . If you can remember anything , any small detail about anyone . One of the dead humans had a tattoo . It was a bird . It was an eagle . It was a screaming eagle . Good . Good . Come on . Need you to take off your shirt . It 's important . Well , if we 're gonna have a three-way . I 'm Berlin . I 'm Kenya . Like the country ? I was born the day the Votans blew it up , so I guess it 's some kind of a tribute . What ? Berlin , like the city ? Yes . Actually , I make films that some people like to call propaganda . So , uh , one day somebody thought it would be funny to ... I get it . Like Leni Riefenstahl . Right . Does that look familiar ? Yeah . Except the eagle had three heads . Three heads . That 's the J Division crest . Meaning ? Meaning that the men who took you prisoner in that laboratory were Earth Republic Special Forces . How did I end up there ? First we have to figure out what happened the night you disappeared . Did you leave of your own free will ? Were you taken ? How long can a human being survive underground without air ? Do I look like a biologist ? You look like a pauper , but that 's incidental . It 's possible she wasn 't completely dead . Perhaps she clawed free of the grave after I left . If that 's true , and her memory returns , I 'll be arrested for poisoning ... Shut your lying mouth ! Stop insulting me . I knew that you weren 't gonna kill her . I knew that you were weak , that you fancied yourself in love . I didn 't need her dead . I needed her under control . No . So spare me this ridiculous nature hike . I know that you lied about killing Kenya Rosewater . I know that you knocked her out and sent her off to live in some obscure retreat , never expecting to see her again . I know this ... This grave that you keep talking about is a fiction . And I don 't care . Don 't do this to me . If you ever loved me . Please . Don 't do what ? Don 't tell me I killed Kenya for nothing . She 's not dead ! Very well . If you 're right , we 'll find an empty grave . I buried her body just over this next rise , marked her grave , planted a small patch of flowers . These flowers of yours , they weren 't lavender by any chance , were they ? How can Kenya Rosewater possibly be alive ? You assured me she 'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground . I was told there were no survivors . Obviously , someone recognized her value as a hostage . I couldn 't have predicted this . All I 'm saying , you better fix it . There 's nothing to fix . Right now , we need to focus on not getting caught . I refuse to accept that . You need to stop thinking like a human and accept what is real . If Joshua Nolan figures out what you did to Amanda , he will take his great big gun and stuff it in your mouth and pull the trigger , evacuating the contents of your sick little head . He will do so without mercy or hesitation . And then it will be my turn . That , Mr. Mayor , is where we 're at . Then , what do you propose ? I never got a chance to lock and fine-tune . Forgotten memories could return , new ones could surface . The only safe option is to wipe it all . And you can do that ? Chemical lobotomy . Painful , but effective . Doesn 't that bother you ? I 've done worse . I knew Defiance was a frontier town , but I thought they 'd at least have sidewalks . Okay , it 's no Manhattan . But it 's the Badlands and away from Connor Lang , which is a very good thing . Kenya ... What ? The guy is such a dickhole and you were the best thing that ever ... Kenya , he thought the baby was his . I let him think that . He had no idea . Okay . Okay . It doesn 't matter . 'Cause guess what ? In this town , we 're gonna find our new husbands . Who says I 'm looking for a husband ? Are you looking for a wife ? No wife . No wife . Women talk too much . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Hey , here 's what I think . This town might not have sidewalks , but I bet it has a bar . Hmm . Hmm ! And I think we should get a drink . I agree . Do you agree ? Let 's go . Hey , look . What ? It 's your new husband . You ! So , Nolan talked to the Mayor and they 're gonna put together a list and ... Are you even listening ? Yeah . I 'm starting to remember things . So , you said that Nolan spoke to the Mayor ? Yes . They 're gonna compile a list of all the men in J Division . They 're gonna run some photos past you . Okay . Are you sure you wanna go through with this ? Yeah . I want to know why I disappeared . Don 't you want things just to go back to normal ? What 's normal ? You running the NeedWant . The NeedWant 's doing fine without me . The NeedWant 's yours . Okay . I have an idea . What if we were to run the NeedWant together ? Oh , God ! No . Yeah . That would be the biggest disaster since Arkfall . You think ? I know . We 're not built to be partners . We 're too stubborn . So , what would you do ? I mean , if I were to run the NeedWant , what would you do ? I 'm not sure . You want to be mayor again . I 'm helping . Whispering in his ear . Steering him . It 's enough . Nothing is ever enough for Amanda Rosewater . Oh ! No . Come on . That 's not true . You love being the boss . I don 't love being the boss . Yes , you do . You totally do . Yes . No . I just happen to be extremely good at it . Do you know how much I have missed you ? I missed you so much . Hello , ladies . I spoke to a colleague of mine , a neurologist in Cedars . He laid out a way to refresh neurosynaptic pathways . Meaning what ? We can bring back your memories . All of them . When ? Now . Thanks . Thought you quit those a long time ago . Quentin . Hey , Dad . Did you get to Mendocino , find your mother ? Well , how is she ? Not like I remember . Those Votan monks , they hate humans . They treated her like an animal . They broke her . She was already broke . She tried to kill herself along with you and Luke and Christie . Yeah , you threw her away . I don 't understand . How can you just do that ? I made a choice . Protect Pilar , the woman I love , or protect her children . I chose you . I chose you kids . It wasn 't an easy choice . Yeah . You should have just shot her . I didn 't have the guts . Anyway , welcome home . You may experience some discomfort . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm ready . Oh , it 's ... It 's beautiful . Wait . I see something . Um ... There 's someone in the water with me . I ... I can ... Uh ... Someone in a bio-suit . Can you see who it is ? Um ... The hood 's coming off . I can see a face . Take it off ! Breathe ! I have water in my lung . No . You 're here in the room with me . You need to let me continue this procedure . She 's had enough . We haven 't even started ! No , she 's done ! Welcome back . I hear you 're a bit of a hero . Saved New York . Well , that 's what they say . I was hoping to meet your sister . Kenya 's resting . And I heard the session with Doc Yewll didn 't go too well . That 's putting it mildly . Well , I can 't say I 'm surprised . Dr. Yewll was trained to torture humans . Healing them must be something of a second career . Good point . You know , there 's a clinic in New York . We could have her transported there under armed guard , of course , get her all the treatment she needs . Forget it . I just got Kenya back . She 's not leaving Defiance . But if you want to help , figure out who in your organization has been conducting secret experiments . Why would I wanna do that ? Earth Republic Special Ops were using my sister as a lab rat . I 'm gonna find whoever issued those orders . When you do , I 'll deliver the killing blow myself . I found her . What ? I found her . You found her . Praise to Rayetso ! I 'm sorry I doubted you . May I ? Such a tiny human head . Yes , it 's darling . Now let 's bury it and go . If this is Kenya , who is with Amanda back in Defiance ? Don 't know . Don 't care . Well , this news will be devastating . I 'm standing here , caked with mud , up to my ass in death stink , and you 're concerned about Amanda Rosewater 's hurt feelings ? Oh ! Let the dead stay buried . No . Stocking up , I see . I 'm making Kenya breakfast . Sugar bread French toast is her favorite . Thank you . I remember . I don 't suppose it surprises you to hear that my husband and I have business contacts from here to Marin . No . Many of whom operate in rather unsavory circles . Well , that 's not much of a secret . I suppose not . I do hear things . You know I loved Kenya . And since her disappearance , I have come to think of you , her sister , as a friend . Is there a point to this ? I need to get back to Kenya . Your sister is dead . The woman in your room is an imposter . I know this is difficult to hear , but I have received this information from multiple sources . And I thought you should know . I feel uncomfortable . It would help if you spoke . If you repeat this lie anywhere , to anyone , I will hurt you . It will be painful and it will be permanent . Congratulations on a long overdue homecoming . I am so happy for you both . Nope . No . No . None of these soldiers look familiar . Sorry . Look at this room . It 's so different . Well , do you remember the first time Amanda caught us in here ? The duct tape . Yes . Yes , you remember that . What was I thinking ? I almost ripped my nipple off when I was trying to take it off . Yeah . You were sticky for hours . She was so mad when we got together . You remember the first time ? I brought you the flower ? No , I don 't , actually . The first night I got into town . I 'd won some scrip at the fight tent ? A lot 's missing , Nolan . What about the time with the handcuffs ? You surprised me in the holding cell . That was a pretty crazy night . No ? Fighting the Volge ? Amanda getting shot ? Yes . Yes , I do remember that . Okay . Now you 're gonna forget about the past . Now , you 're gonna make new memories . You 're gonna make love to me . Kenya , listen . Your scars . What ? From your ex-husband . They 're gone . Stay here . I 'll be right back . Is she trying to touch us ? She sees her own reflection . It 's a good sign . The resemblance is incredible . Can it think ? The host is Indogene . She thinks a hell of a lot more efficiently than you , monkey boy . Can she understand what we 're saying ? Doesn 't matter . I 'll wipe this time period clean after I graft Amanda 's memories onto the brain map . What 's her life span ? It 's new technology . I did my best , but ... True beauty dies fast . No ! Amanda . I need to talk to you . Have you noticed anything strange about Kenya 's memories ? Uh , the older ones , from before the disappearance ? Look , there are gaps , but she 's adjusting . Okay . I 've ... I 've noticed a pattern . Now , she only knows about memories that you were present for or you knew about . Anything you weren 't aware of , it 's a hole . I need to talk to Kenya . Kenya ? Kenya . I don 't understand . Sit . No , I don 't wanna sit . Sit . No ! I know my sister ! It 's her . I wish it were . She 's not ... She 's an Indogene . She 's not ! Amanda ! Whoever implanted you with that EGO device a few weeks ago , they stole your memories . No ! You don 't know that . They put them into a perfect copy of your sister . That 's just a theory . You don 't know ! Amanda , her scars are gone . I 'm so sorry . Oh , God . My gun 's missing . I have to warn you , there 's no happy ending to this story . Are you certain that you want to hear this ? I 'm an Indogene ? Deep down you are . In the Pale Wars , we grafted human memories and DNA onto Indogene volunteers to create spies that looked and acted human . Are you telling me that I volunteered for this ? Not exactly . You were a captured V.C. spy . Pottinger plucked you from Camp Reverie in the dead of night and brought you to me . I 'm sorry . You deserved better than this . I am not interested in your sympathy . Keep talking . I had your Indogene body as my canvas . And there was no shortage of Kenya Rosewater DNA scattered around the NeedWant . What I didn 't have were Kenya 's memories , so I stole them from her sister . What went wrong ? A Votanis soldier interrupted the procedure . That 's why your memories are still jumbled . How long do I have to live ? Couple of months . No more than three . No . You are gonna fix me . And you are gonna give me a normal life span . As an Indogene ? I can 't . As Kenya Rosewater , I don 't know , maybe . I have a colleague in the Bay Area . Eren Niden . Maybe ... " Maybe " is not good enough . If you 're gonna kill someone , kill the Mayor . Pottinger wants you dead . You really are a craven little thing , aren 't you ? You 're a monster . Actually you 're the monster . I 'm Dr. Frankenstein and our bald friend here is Igor . His plan was to fake a dramatic rescue and reunite two sisters . Amanda would be so grateful that her panties would just melt away at your tender touch . You 're not funny . And what was Amanda supposed to do when she found out ... Mourn you and move on . Move on to you . I knew you 'd run for the safe . Yeah ? Yeah . It 's what I would do . I 'm not Kenya . You might not have been born that way , but you are now . No ! Who I am is a collection of leftover memories . I am an echo . You are my sister . Your sister is dead . Look ! No . No , you belong with me . Look , I 'll get you the help you need . I promise . I am not playing house with a human . Next time I 'm gonna snap your neck . This is all my fault . I should never have released Dr. Yewll from Camp Reverie . I knew she had a checkered past , but this was beyond the pale . As it turned out , she built that thing to exploit your access to high-level Earth Republic officers . I 'm sorry . I need your help . Really ? There was a time when I needed you rather desperately to help me dispose of Jalina 's eyeless corpse . You refused me . You 're my only friend . Please . My sister loved to travel . She used to say that in order to appreciate the places you 're going , you have to leave behind the places you 've been . Welcome to your new home . My sister loved going out into the world . Seeing new things , having new experiences . She never looked back . She never dwelled on the past . She called it " being morbid . " She believed that all good things ended sooner than you 'd like them to . A favorite song , a good book , even your own life . The brevity is what makes it so special . Precious . My sister believed that before you could allow something or someone new into your heart , that you first need to make room . And that means learning to let go . I love you , baby sister . To Kenya . To Kenya .

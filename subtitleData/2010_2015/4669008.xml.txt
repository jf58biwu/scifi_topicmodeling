Are the mountains in the Yukon as tall as that Mountain ? Oh , buddy , they 're taller . You know what ? As a matter of fact , during the gold rush , prospectors , they had to climb up mount Logan or face certain death . Did they survive ? Some of them , some of them did , and then some went insane , and some died of scurvy . But , buddy , the ones that did make it , they went on to be millionaires . The Yukon sounds wicked . Yeah , yeah . I 've always dreamt of dying insane , on a Mountain . It is ! It is wicked cool , man . It 's like nature 's theme park . Sorry , did you just compare the Yukon to an amusement park ? I did . I think it sounds cool . Yeah , right ? So like , are there many kids on the site where you work ? No , no kids , uh , but ... What about women ? Are there any women on the pipeline , dad ? Beth ... No , just ... It does , it does , it sounds wicked . Sounds wicked and cool . You know what ? If you have something to say , why don 't you just say it ? Guys , guys , come on ... You disappear for months , and then you just show up . Do you think that we 'll just forget that you ditched us ? That you left us with nothing ... With no home , and no money ? Stop ! I was trying to get a job ! So you abandoned us ? What kind of father just leaves his kids ? ! Great . Have a seat . Charlotte said you had a few questions . Yeah , just a couple . How 's the detox sequence going ? How do you feel ? Well , I feel like you left out some pretty significant details in our conversations yesterday . Such as ? What 's all this Sci-Fi stuff ? Are you even a real religion ? Yes , we are . The IRS spent twenty-six years trying and failing to prove otherwise . No other religion in the history of man has undergone such scrutiny . Yeah , well , after what I read online , I 'm not surprised . The aggression you 're feeling is quite common part of the detox process . Believe it or not , it 's actually a good sign . That 's not an answer . Let me ask you this : Are you feeling better ? Happier ? More confident ? Well , I was ... Until I opened my computer . Well , don 't open your computer . You wanna get better , Connor , I know you do . Don 't throw away the chance because of something you read on the Internet . This is your pattern . You sabotage the good , nurture the bad . Am I wrong ? No . Break your pattern . All right , this is gonna sting a little bit . Can you handle it ? Ooh ! Tough guy , huh ? What , a tough guy can 't wince ? I took a bite for you , look . Well , I gotta say , that 's a first for me . Uh , can I ask you something ? And I mean , feel free to say no . I mean , don 't say no if you don 't wanna say no , it 's not like I 'm gonna fire you if you say no ... I 'm ... I 'm totally screwing this up . Do you wanna go out on a date , with me ? Please don 't sue me . I 'd love to . Um , but uh ... I shouldn 't . Things are just a little complicated right now . No , I totally get it . Uh , I just ... Had to ask . Okay . Uh , can I take a rain check ... For when things un-complicate themselves ? Yeah . I honor rain checks . Okay . Good night . You too . Back any better ? Yeah , all better . I just really enjoy this point of view . What ? I got you some supplies . Muscle relaxants , ice pack , and heat pack - lady 's choice ... And ... A girdle ? It 's a decompression belt . We 're getting you to this audition . No . No , we 're not . How do you expect me to audition when I 'm half-asleep on back pills , wearing some weird medical chastity belt ? This isn 't gonna happen . Just because you got me into this situation doesn 't mean you can get me out . Whoa ! How is this my fault ? You made me tell my parents I dropped out of school . You got me kicked out of my apartment . You carried pillows while I carried books . You are the reason I 'm missing the most important audition of life . Nick : Okay , first of all , I did not know there were pillows in that box . I just grabbed the biggest one 'cause I 'm a gentleman . And I 'm not the one who made you lie to your parents while embezzling $ 80,000 dollars from them . This is on you , not me . So you can lie there and feel bad about it , or we can do something about it . Just leave me alone . - Ow ! What the ... - Put ' em on . Leave you alone ... This is really good . I didn 't know these guys did takeout . Yeah , well , they don 't usually . And now you 're just showing off . Mm-hmm . Have you ever been to Italy ? Uh , no . Actually , I haven 't really been anywhere except for L.A. , Toronto and Montreal . Oh . There ishis place in Florence , their gelato 's so good that they were the only place the allies supplied power to during world war two . That must be some good gelato . Right ? We should go . I 'm telling you , you 'd love it . When I get back , I 'm gonna take you there , okay ? You wanna take me to Italy ? Yeah . Why not ? And when do you get back ? A year ? Two years ? What are we talking about ? This is crazy . Why ? What 's crazy about it ? Because it 's never going to happen . You 're gonna be gone and that 'll be it . Might as well just ... Be realistic and enjoy the time we have now . I 'm sorry , did u just give me a three day heads up on our breakup ? Yeah . I ... I guess I did . Thanks , D. I needed that . Sorry about going over . No , no . We got it , that 's all that matters . And that was good , Kal . It 's a pleasure meeting you . You should bring the old man through more often . Maybe I will . I 'd like that . At 're you up to ? You wanna grab a bite to eat ? I would , but I already got plans . Okay . Another time . What the hell you doing here ? No , he cool . He 's with me . Yeah . Go on in . Turns out the kid 's got skills . Business is business . All right , Sabrina Reynolds ? Sabrina ? Sorry , is this a duo ? Will doesn 't like teams . No ! No , no , no . Ignore me . I 'm not here . I 'll be right over there when you 're done , okay ? Break a leg . So the first thing you should know is ... I threw my back out today and I can 't move . The second thing you should know is that my act relies heavily on juggling . So who 's ready for some very still comedy ? How are you guys at using your imaginations ? Can I come to the base to see you off when you go ? Yeah , I 'm not really one for big good-byes . No , it 's a - it 's a superstition thing . 'Kay , I don 't even let my parents see me off . No , I get it . So what 's it like ... Over there ? Well , it depends , you know ? Sometimes it 's scary . But , Abby , sometimes it 's boring as hell . You know what the good part is ... You never take anything for granted . There 's no such thing as an unimportant minute . Well , how many more minutes do we have ? Around four thousand . I don 't want you to go . Is that her ? Yeah . Connor , can I talk to you for a second ? I 'll see you inside . Is that her ? Yeah . Mm . Well , she 's ... Tall . Um , look , I uh ... I just wanted to ... Sometimes I ... Ugh ! Okay ... um ... We 're making a movie , do you want to be in it ? What ? Cam and Kevin and I are making a movie and we need someone to play my love interest for a couple scenes . It 's a great role and a very small time commitment . So uh ... what do ya say ? That 's what you wanna talk about ? I thought maybe you were about to apologize . Well , I was , but , you know , I ... I ... come on ! You know . You are amazing , you know that ? You don 't wanna talk about all the mean things that you said ? Do you wanna talk about all the mean things you said ? No . Not particularly . Okay . Can we call this the talk then ? What 's this movie about ? Well , it 's this beautiful , sad , magic-realism kinda thing . I 'm the slowly dying girl and you 're the man I can never have . Do you die at the end ? Yes . When do we start ? Admit it . You missed this a little bit . I admit nothing . ♪ Unless you speak from your heart ♪ Thanks , Bumblebee . There you go , buddy . I guess it was a little bit too much excitement for one day .

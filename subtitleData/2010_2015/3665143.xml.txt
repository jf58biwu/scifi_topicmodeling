 Previously on " V " ... Dad asked if I could stay with him . It 's time that we told him the truth About who he really is . ( Lisa ) I think Tyler 's ready . But he 's still not here on the ship with you . Get him . Lisa . I missed you . I 'm pregnant . You need to tell her the truth before she finds out . John May started the Fifth Column . The first group of visitors to ever turn Against the leadership . Anna 's birthing soldiers . ( Ryan ) You need to stop ' em . The visitors took everything I had . I don 't want that to happen to you . Georgie . Long live The Fifth Column ! ( crickets chirping ) ( loud whooshing ) ( rumbling ) Dad , I heard something outside , And I think I saw a U.F.O. There 's no such thing as U.F.O.s , buddy . Go back to bed . But I ... but I ... but ... That 's okay . Go on . I love you , James . ... With full respect for the freely expressed ... ( rumbling continues ) ( dialing ) ( lowers voice ) They 're here for me . Tell the others I 'm going dark . ( hangs up receiver ) ( loud whirring ) ( electricity humming ) ( owl hoots ) ( grunts ) Ah ! Did you really think Anna wouldn 't find out You turned against us ? ( grunts ) ( whoosh ) ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( clank ) ( groans ) ( panting ) How could you do this to your own kind , Start a resistance ? These people are worth saving . No . It 's your human skin . You 've been wearing it too long . You got confused . You 're sick . Bliss is a sickness . It 's mind control . Human emotion ... it 's ... it 's not sickness . It 's beautiful . Human emotion ? You betrayed us for human emotion ? Yeah . You may as well kill me now 'Cause I will never stop hunting you . ( panting ) One day you 'll understand . You can 't escape , John May ! You can 't escape ! Can someone please lay out for me who the hell that guy is ? John May was the first V to turn against Anna . He started the resistance . I was with him just before he disappeared . You knew him . Ryan , why didn 't you say ? Because no one needed to know until now . Look , the bottom line is We are not leaving Georgie up there to die . The only reason he 's on that ship is because he tried to save me . I gotta get back on the ship . But how ? It 'll be impossible now . We 'll do it . We 'll figure it out . How much does he know ... about who you are , where you are ? Who your loved ones are ? I 'm not saying he 'll talk cause he 's a coward . I 'm saying , everyone has a breaking point . Everyone talks . No , not Georgie . He 'll hold on till we get him . Which as you compadre here just spelled out , is impossible . We may not be able to get back on that ship , But there may be another way to save him . How ? Joshua , the one who helped me Embed the " John May lives " message . He 's Fifth Column . Said there 's a way to contact them , some sort of comms device . It 's encrypted and the tech 's outdated , So the V 's don 't monitor for it anymore . If we can get our hands on that ... We can coordinate a rescue plan With The Fifth Column aboard the ship . Good . First sensible thing anyone 's said , and it 's the blonde . Where 's the device ? Upstate . Town called Reedsville . Belonged to John May . But there 's someone else . His stepson . He might be able to lead us to that device . Great . Let 's go . ( groans ) ( electronic whoosh ) ( inhales ) ( exhales deeply ) The human managed to fight off the effects of the memory chamber . We 've been unable to retrieve any useful information about who helped him embed the message in our broadcast . He won 't give names . Impress upon him more strongly that he has no choice in the matter . I 've already sent for the human pain expert from the Tokyo ship . Your pregnancy ... You should be resting . There 's no time for that . I need to make sure The " Live Aboard " program stays on track . There are whispers of an anti-V terrorist group . Polls show people have grown apprehensive About coming to live on the ship , Which will affect the success of our " Live Aboard " program . Get Chad Decker I 'll address the people directly . I want those bodies on this ship . Uh , um ... Hi . Hello . ( chuckles ) You are ? Lisa , Tyler 's friend . Ah . It 's nice to meet you , Mr. Evans . Hi . Um ... Tyler 's mom didn 't ... mention anything about you coming . Did , uh , Tyler invite you ? Actually no . I just thought I 'd check in on him . Why does he need you to check in ? He didn 't . I just thought he could use the support . It 's just , um , This situation 's been a little hard , right ? I mean , since you left ? Have you had breakfast yet ? Um , oh , I 'm sorry . Wait ... wait a minute . What did he say , exactly ? He hasn 't said anything bad about you , Mr. Evans . So you guys , uh , met . Huh . Don 't worry , dad . I slept on the couch . I swear . Um , Lisa showed up late last night , And ... ( chuckles ) Kind of surprised me . Huh . S-surprised me , too . ( clears throat ) Could you ... ( whispers ) Come here , please ? ( lowered voice ) Um , listen , I know you wanted to spend some time with me , But is it ... Is it okay if she hangs with us ? Dad ... I really like her . Of course . Thanks . This is Chad Decker for WNT , Bringing you an exclusive interview With the V high commander Anna . It 's good to see you again . Thank you , Chad . I know there have been rumors about the messages Sent from our ships during my announcement last night . Yes . " John May lives " ... Can you tell us what that means ? I wish I could , Chad . It appears it was merely a glitch in our system , An overlay of old code from our language training program Used to learn the English language . What 's of greater interest to me Are the things that are going right . People are so excited about the " Live Aboard " program . It will give us a chance , before we leave , To reciprocate the hospitality you have shown us . Later today , you will join me as I sit down With some of the invitees to answer their questions . I can assure you , those joining us Will be treated with the utmost care and respect . This is the last time we 're going to ask . What are the names of your co-conspirators ? ( panting ) Oh , you want names ? Evelyn , my wife . There 's a name . We were 2 months shy of our 12th anniversary . Here 's two more ... Brian and Evan , my 2 boys , 6 and 8 . You freaks killed them , too . ( Anna ) Our doctors will assure that you will receive The best medical attention we can provide . I 'm Dr. Maita . Let me explain to you how the scours operate . It 's a curious little creature . It likes to explore every inch of the human body , From the inside . Its preference is to travel along the nerve lines . The scour enters near the face ... ( exhales deeply ) And exits via the soft tissue , Usually through the reproductive organs . And remember , We are of peace , always . ( screams ) ( grunting ) ♪ V 1x07 ♪ John May original air date on April 13 , 2010 After the John May message , We anticipate resistance members will come out of hiding . As sleeper agents embedded in key positions , You need to be ready . Each of you has one of these in your possession . If you notice any suspicious activity ... ( electronic whirring ) An assistance will be deployed to your location . Dismissed . ( groaning and panting ) ( whispers ) Stop . Please . I 'll give you the names you want . ( Ryan ) Pull over here . This is John May 's place . ( engine turns off ) Does he know his stepfather was a V ? No , May wanted to protect his family . ( cell phone rings ) Told ' em nothing . ( whispers ) Just a second , guys . ( normal voice ) Yeah . You know , you could have told me That the girlfriend was part of the package . What are you talking about ? She 's there ? Lisa ? Yes . She showed up last night . I mean , what is the deal with her ? She seems to know all our dirty laundry . She 's a peace ambassador with Tyler . Joe , I 'm sorry . I can 't get into this right now . Erica , I 'm having a real hard time with this . All these years , he 's been blaming himself , Thinking that he 's the reason that we broke up , because he went off and crashed his bike . I mean , he ... He needs to know the truth . Move it . Godzilla 's getting nervous . Can we please not do this right now ? I have to go . I will you call you the minute I get a chance , okay ? The lies catch up to people , Erica , sooner or later . Tyler needs to know that I 'm not his father . ( beep ) ( pants ) ( beep ) ( sighs ) You okay ? ( snaps cell phone shut ) ( panting ) No . I 've never told anyone this . When Tyler was 14 , he wrecked his bike , ruptured his spleen . Joe and I went in to donate blood , and ... There 's supposed to be certain matchups in blood work between parents and their kids . Ours didn 't line up . I 'm not following . They told us that Joe wasn 't Tyler 's father . The tests aren 't 100 % accurate , but ... Doctors don 't know everything . Joe never believed me . If you don 't have trust in a relationship , you don 't have anything . What does Tyler know ? Sometimes you have to lie to people to protect them . Am I talking to the FBI Agent or the mother ? Oh . You 're not supposed to be kicking yet , are you ? ( beep ) ( speed dialing ) ( telephone rings , beep ) Hey , honey . Uh , sorry to bother you at work , But , um , I was wondering If you knew where you put Dr. Pearlman 's card . I felt the baby kicking . Give me a call if you get a sec , okay ? Thank you . ( beep ) ( door opens ) ( hangers clatter ) ( creaks ) James May ? Yeah . I 'm Ryan Nichols . I was a friend of your stepfather . Is it okay if we come in ? We need to talk to you about him . A friend of ours is in trouble . James , who is it ? ( James ) Some people that want to talk to me . Well , honey , invite them in . Can I talk with you a few minutes in private ? It 's urgent . Uh ... You know what ? Why don 't I go put on a pot of coffee ? Ryan . I might be able to help . Hey , your friend 's here . Good to see you again . It 's been , what , a year now ? Uh , we were just about to sit down and have dinner . I haven 't eaten yet . I 'll join you . James took red ribbon at the science fair today . Oh , yeah ? Salt volcano ? Cartesian diver . Cartesian diver . Mm-hmm . Good job , kiddo . So how 'd you two lose touch ? Our priorities shifted . And what are your plans while you 're in town ? I just came with some old friends to catch up a little . They 're coming by later , in fact . They 're eager to see John . My family 's not familiar with the old gang . Not at all ? No . Don 't really dwell on the past . There 's too much richness in the present . Our pals have already planned to see you , counting on it . You know how they are . They won 't leave without at least saying " hello . " Tell you what ... why don 't , uh , we meet them out instead ? No need to subject Lillie and James To a house full of guests on a school night . Sure . Wouldn 't want to inconvenience your family , now would we ? I 'm not interested in talking about What my stepdad thought , okay ? So if you 're just here to , I don 't know , find closure , Then I can tell you what I learned a long time ago ... You don 't find any . So what did your friends want to talk to James about ? A family matter . ( liquid pours ) His stepfather ? I 'm not sure . Our buddy 's pretty secretive . You heard about the John May message that went out from the bottom of the V ships ? There 's a lot of John Mays in the world . Your stepfather started the resistance against the V 's Before anybody even knew they were here . We 're part of that resistance now . What resistance ? I thought the V 's were friendly . You guys are insane . So how did you guys meet ? At a restaurant . He was one table over , and he sort of ... Caught my eye . That sounds romantic . So why now ? What do you want ? John May had a comms device he used to communicate With the resistance aboard the mother ship . We need that device to contact an ally up there . And , James , we 're running out of time . Okay , maybe we could raise Mork and Kal-El On the kree omni-wave projector . Look , James , I know it 's a lot to wrap your head around . - You think ? - Where did your stepdad keep his things ? Boxed up in a storage unit in town . Got tired of looking at his stuff everywhere . Look , man , I 'm sure you and my stepdad were friends , And you clearly have your whole cult fantasy thing About how swell of a guy John May was , But you weren 't the one he left when he killed himself . ( James sniffles ) James ... That suicide note was fake . - ( Erica ) Have you lived here long ? - No . I 'm from L.A. , so ... - Yeah ? Did you go to school out there ? - Mm-hmm . UCLA . - Great football . You like football ? - Oh , yeah . - I love the Trojans . - Me , too . The only problem is , UCLA 's team is the Bruins . ( chuckles nervously ) I meant the Bruins . Oops . ( grunts ) ( drawer rattles ) Aah ! ( objects clatter in distance ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( gun cocks ) Aah ! ( grunting ) ( shrieks ) ( crack ) A shame . Pretty girl like her ... ( thud ) Grace ? ( whispers ) Grace . Oh , God . Storage unit in town . Let 's move . ( inhales sharply ) Are you with us ? ( grunts ) James , are you with us ? - Yeah . - Come on . The name you gave us isn 't real . Alex Morgan isn 't real . Yes ... She was . She was my unborn daughter . ( panting ) He 's stronger than we anticipated . He resisted the scours . You 're going about this the wrong way . He can lead us to The Fifth Column . We have to dig deeper than scours . How long had she been like that for ? Why was she with me ? The V 's planted her with you to watch and wait . She wasn 't human , mate , So don 't sweat it . How well did you know my stepdad ? - He meant a lot to me . - That 's not an answer . Yeah , been a lot of that today . All right , let 's slow down . - Joshua said it was here somewhere ? - No , he said it was in Reedsville . He didn 't say it was here . I found it . - What if it doesn 't work ? - We pray ... That Georgie dies quickly . Hey , come on . Yeah , he 's been hiding something all day . I don 't trust this guy . - Yeah , that makes two of us . - Yeah ? Just stop it . Stop it . This is about Georgie ... Georgie , who 's up there right now . - We can 't afford mistrust , guys . - Make no mistake , we will save him . We can 't lose our way every time we hit a roadblock . Get it together . ( whirring ) ( shots ) What the hell are you shooting at ? ( glass shatters ) ( whirring ) I don 't know . But we better get out of here before it wakes up . ( whirs ) It 's that thing from the warehouse raid . It 's a seeker . - Where is it ? - I saw something flying over there . - Where the hell is it ? - Does anybody see it ? Don 't move . ( pants ) How the hell did they find us ? Your girl with the Freddy Krueger claws ... Did she give you something , like a-a promise ring , anything ? Yeah , yeah . Uh , uh ... She gave me the watch . ( watch shatters ) ( ticking ) Let 's go . ( erica ) Go , go , go . Come on . ( jack ) Come on . Let 's go . Have you prepared what I asked for ? Yes . It 's ready when you are . If we 've learned anything , it 's that emotion is weakness . Love is the greatest flaw of humans , And our best tool to break them . He says he misses his family . Let 's show him his family . ( electronic whoosh ) Since we couldn 't use your memories , We 've decided to show you someone else 's . Here are the memories of the V who killed your family . ( woman ) Run . I 'm right behind you . Get away from me ! Don 't ! Get out of my house ! Turn it off ! ( screaming ) Keep playing it until he tells us what we want to know . Turn it off ! ( screaming ) Perfect . See ? - Pretty easy , right ? - Yeah . I 'm thirsty . I 'm gonna get some sodas . You want one ? - Uh , yeah . - Can I get you one ? - Please . - Sure . ( chuckles ) Listen , um , my dad wants me to stay a few weeks . And I 'll still see you . Believe me , I-I r-really wanna see you . And I know it sucks , but maybe ... Maybe this will help me and him fix some stuff . What ? I overheard something , But I-I don 't think I should say anything . What is it ? Just tell me . I can 't . It 's ... it 's not my place . Lisa , please , just ... It 's okay . I think your father 's been lying to you . About what ? I don 't think he 's really your dad . ( chuckles ) Come on . That 's ... That 's ridiculous . I overheard him talking to your mom . Sorry . - I know I shouldn 't have said anything . - Hey , guys , here we go . Here you are . Hey . ( bottles clink ) What is it ? What 's wrong ? There 's a weird mix-up going on here . Um ... Lisa just said that she heard you talking to mom , And you said something about you not really being my dad . I ... I don 't know . It 's ... It 's crazy . Oh , Ty . ( sighs ) It 's true ? It can 't be . I ... This is me and ... And you . It 's , uh , it 's complicated . Don 't you look at her . - You lied . - Wait . Wait , wait , - What , is this why you left mom ? - No . Yeah . I said I couldn 't trust her , Ty . What about me ? You left me , too , dad . What , you feel duped for raising somebody else 's kid ? No . I love you , Ty , Either way . Please trust that . You need to go talk to your mom about this . Yeah , I will . Ty ! When I applied to be a part of " Live Aboard " At the healing center , I never thought I 'd get picked . And ... ( video rewinds ) I never thought I 'd get picked . I 've always thought of myself as having bad luck , But this ... Why 'd you think you had bad luck ? When I was 15 , I had an appendectomy , And complications left me unable to have children . I mean , I feel blessed for everything that I have . But at family reunions , My siblings all have big families ... - Not a one under eight kids . - Everyone in your family ? Yes . ( video rewinds ) ... Siblings all have big families ... Not a one under eight kids . ( video rewinds ) - Not a one under eight kids . - Everyone in your family ? Yes . It 's huge . ( high-pitched whirring ) ( lowered voice ) Yes ? Joshua ? Joshua , it 's Ryan . - You found it . Good . - Yeah , hey , listen , We have a friend that 's up there . His name is Georgie Sutton . He went up there looking for me , and they caught him . - I haven 't heard anything . - Yeah , well , he 's up there , okay , - And I need you to find him , all right ? - I will . Keep the comms device close . ( beep ) ( beep ) Is it true ... what you said ? My stepdad faked that suicide note ? Yeah . ( chuckles ) Bastard . Hey . That man changed my life . Yeah ? Good for you . He changed ours , too . Now listen to me , James . Your stepfather didn 't abandon you . He never would have left you and your mother if he wasn 't forced to . How the hell would you know ? Because I 'm the one that forced him to leave . - So what have you been doing this year ? - Looking for you . No , I mean , what have you experienced in your time here ? You never took a drive in the middle of the night Just to feel the wind in your face ? Or had a cold pint on a warm day ? Saw a woman who literally took your breath away ? No , see , I think you 've been touched , Living among people . Maybe not much , but there 's a glimmer . I can see it in your face . You know , the humans ... They have an expression they use when they realize what truly matters to them . They say they 've found their " true north . " ( lock clicks ) Well , I 've found mine here , Ryan , With that woman and that boy . What 's that ? That 's my suicide note . Take a good look at that family in there , Ryan . You tell me , am I gonna need it ? They 're expecting you , John . It 's too late . Ten years ago , when I came to your house for dinner ... That was the day that I killed John May . You knew and you didn 't say anything ? - You knew that John May is dead ? - No , not just dead . Dead at his hand . Every single day , I wish I could go back and undo what I did , But I can 't . All I can say is your stepfather led the way . I 've taken risks that you can 't even imagine , Because of what he taught me . This fight ... Will be brutal beyond anything you 've ever seen . And you , too . And John May is our greatest weapon in it . Anna ordered his death . Every single time she sees the message " John May lives , " It 's like a dagger in her eye . The Fifth Column exists because of him . He existed because of you . You and your mother ... you taught him what it 's like to be human . He taught me . So if nothing else , I just figured That you should know the truth . No more lies . ( whispers ) Yeah . I feel really stupid forgetting the combination . No , it happens more than you 'd think . Uh , let 's just see , the model number here . The reset code is ... 8-3-3-2-8 pound . ( safe clicks ) Okay , well , I 'll , uh , I 'll just see myself out then , huh ? You convinced a lot of people today To come live aboard your ships ... People like these two . This woman comes from a family With unusually high fertility rates , But she 's got a bad luck streak , can 't have kids . This guy ... brilliant violin player , But a total mess . I looked into our other guests from today 's story . ( taps photos ) Same deal . All so full of potential , But they 're broken toys . This type of person is of great interest to you . The question is ... Why ? As sophisticated as humans are , You don 't see the true value in people . You discard them . I see their inner worth . Every V , regardless of history or luck Or circumstance , receives my care . I 'm only showing humans the same regard . Yeah . I 'm not buying it . I don 't know exactly what all this means yet , But I 'm pretty sure it adds up to something . And if I can get this far in half a day , How far do you think I could get in a month ? What do you want ? I 'll tell you what I don 't want . I don 't want to be ordinary . If you were ordinary , Mr. Decker , you wouldn 't be here . Which is exactly why I 'm gonna keep digging into this . And eventually , I 'll find enough to run this story . Or you can give me a bigger one . I can protect you . The question is , can we keep helping each other ? I think that we 'll be helping each other for some time to come . ( bell tolling ) ( high-pitched whirring ) Ryan . Yeah , I 'm here . How 's he doing ? He 's alive , And he hasn 't broken yet . Can you move him ? Everyone 's being watched too closely right now . But the " Live Aboard " program commences in a few days . I might be able to smuggle him onto an outbound shuttle . Will he last that long ? Yes . They 'll keep him at the edge of life . Is he conscious ? Can he talk ? Go ahead . Buddy , how you doing ? ( inhales deeply ) Been better . ( sighs ) You 're off the ship ? You 're safe , right ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm safe . - We 're all safe . - Good . We 're gonna get you out of there , okay ? No . That 's what they 're waiting for . That 's what they want . You come rescue me , you all get caught . Georgie , listen to me , all right ? Just give us a few days . Just hang on , all right ? I don 't have a few more days , Ryan . You know that . - Let me speak to Jack . - Georgie , please . I need to speak to Jack , Ryan . We 're not leaving you up there , Georgie . It 's bigger than me now , father . No , Georgie . Listen to me , okay ? Hang on . I 'll see you around , Jack . Are you sure ? I 'm ready to see my family now . God ... Bless you , George Sutton . God bless you . Make sure they don 't track it back to you . John May lives . To Georgie ... Not in vain .

I promise . - Not according to him . - ( crying ) I know . How could you not tell me ? Because ... I was scared you wouldn 't believe me , and , Tyler , I thought if I just kept going , That somebody would tell me that it was a mistake , Because it is . It 's a mistake . I didn 't . I never ...

The emotional trauma must have been too intense for him . We did not get any names . " John May lives " ... Trite and untrue , but even still , The message The Fifth Column sent seems to have produced something of a groundswell . Let them have this one victory ... Because I 'm about to deliver them ... A thousand defeats .

 Previously on Continuum ... Who killed me ? I 'm the one that risked everything to come back for you . He doesn 't know and I 'm leaving that decision up to you , okay . You 're in control . The dead man tells me I 'm going to get some answers . Curtis is of the opinion I 'm wasting my time with you . Okay I 'll keep working on the CMR playback of your murder remotely . Don 't worry , Kiera , we 'll find your killer . I inherited Piron . The heart is a feeble instrument . Easily fooled . You haven 't met that part of yourself yet . The part that will do anything to survive . It 's him . When did I become such a dick ? I needed to protect you and I thought ... Everyone is trying to protect me , but you scratch that protection and it 's self-interest underneath . Alec , I trust you . The other one betrayed me . Why are you here ? Emily . I choose you . Patient Alpha Bravo 327 . Code 6 termination . Inform next of kin . Tariq ? Help me . It 's okay , Kiera . Here . Neural spray is useless . And you know it . Barely numbs the pain . They 're close on an antidote . False hope isn 't relief . Kiera . You ... you ... you can help me . You just have to be brave . I know what you 're asking ? I can 't . Don 't . The remedy is on its way . You tell my family I had no other choice . You hear me ? I had no other choice . It 's here . Kiera ! It 's here . Don 't lie to me . I swear . The cure is here . Look . Help me . It 's like watching pixels dry . This is the holy beyond and all of does not compute . Okay well what 's the basic problem ? Well besides the damaged stream , let 's see , we have software interpolating noise at signal , signal is gag . Two identical seam-wares stacked on top of each other so the program thinks it 's impossible , which it is . The analytical programs keep throwing up . I 'm looking over my shoulder every day for someone who might want to kill me twice . If I could go any faster I ... I mean really why wouldn 't I ? I 'm sorry . You 're right . I 'm the time traveling grim reaper . Everything I touch turns to death . Emily 's alive . Yeah , for now . What if time self-corrects ? I mean , not to get all Rod Sterling over here . But what if all I 've done was just throw a few more people into the gears while playing God ? You know I have to leave , Kiera . You know me . It 's ... it 's the only option . Where will you go ? I don 't know , it doesn 't matter . I just , I don 't want to become that Alec . I don 't want to be like him in 2077 . I can 't keep hurting people . It 's ... good to know . You know , sometimes you look at me and I get this horror movie chill . I 'll make sure everything keeps running and I 'll have it upload directly to your CMR once it 's finished . Thanks . It 's like listening to 16 channels at once . Well maybe he 's not as important as you think . He is important . His revelation ... Was a miss . He knew nothing about Cameron joining us so how much of a revelation was it ? How useful is he ? Until we understand what 's inside him he 's not going anywhere . From the moment you arrived we both knew the task you 'd been set . I 've been patient . Hopeful that the path would reveal itself . It hasn 't . Yet the continuum must be preserved . You know firsthand the consequences of an unstable timeline . You have to choose now . I need more time . Just ... just a little more time . You 're bargaining Kiera . The damage to the timeline can ripple out slowly . But we must act before that ripple becomes a storm . And act decisively . Without mercy , you mean . No , Kiera . With mercy . And compassion . For all those who will be affected . You are talking about killing Alec . And Alec . You want certainty . Facts to prove you 're making the right choice . We don 't have that . But there 's a sense . There 's a clarity that comes . You guess . We rely on science as much as we can but faith always plays its part in the end . Whether he pulled the trigger or not , time traveling Alec Sadler caused your death . His actions led to the murder of Escher , his own father . Alec is ready to renounce his future . Escape with Emily and never come back . Wouldn 't that suffice ? Does that sound like the Alec Sadler who ensures our future comes to pass ? Rejoice , Kiera . He 's making the decision for you . Now is the time . But if you feel you can 't handle this ... It 's a terrible idea . Kellogg has money and resources and he 's shady as hell . He 'll know how to help us disappear . He 's never helped anyone when it didn 't benefit him more . What are you going to have to do for him ? Whatever it takes . Don 't say that . You make a handshake deal with Matthew Kellogg , better make sure you have all your fingers afterwards . You 're overstating it . We need to get Escher 's file on me before we go anywhere . If we can go anywhere . He had me under his thumb . I don 't want to give the other guy that power . He 's already leaked some of your files to the VPD . How much more could there be ? Oh . Let 's go on the dark-net . Find a way there . No offense but at least Kellogg is a devil I know . There 's no way in hell I 'm poking under that rock . You come up with something then . You got papers ? Admin never has their shit together . Go ahead . Thank you . Compound 's a match . It 's what we 're here for . Locked . Locked ! Evacuate ! Evacuate this building ! There is a dangerous chemical leak ! Evacuate ! Evacuate ! Evacuate this building ! There is a dangerous chemical leak ! Evacuate ! Hey , you two . There is a chemical leak ! We gotta evacuate right now . Woah . Leave . Okay man , take it easy ! I 'm sorry ! Evacuate ! Let 's finish up ! Copy that ! Evacuate ! Evacuate this building ! There is a dangerous chemical leak ! Lucas , we 're inbound with the payload . This is Jim at Gate B. We have a truck approaching quickly . I need assistance ! I repeat , I need assistance ! Whoa ! So security camera footage positively ID 'd Travis Verta . It was like he wanted to be sure we knew it was him . What would Liber8 want with a truck full of Sonmanto chemicals ? Maybe they 're back in the drug game . They changed tack and gained ground . Why switch up the Robin Hood act now ? I don 't know . Bet you $ 20 it has something to do with this guy . Mr. Richardson ! Surprised to see you here . And I 'm surprised to see VPD 's Terrorist Task Force responding to a false alarm . Liber8 infiltrates a chemical plant and makes no attempt to conceal their identity . Oh yeah , nothing suspicious there . Nothing was stolen . Just like the safety deposit boxes ? Our staff has already conducted an extensive inventory . Nothing is missing . And security has confirmed not a single sensitive area was breached . Yeah well we 'll still need to investigate . We can start with the witnesses . I expect no less . Hey Betty ... Hey check and see if any tanker trucks have been reported stolen . Mr. Richardson tells us you surprised the thieves . That 's correct . They pulled in , I realized their papers were falsified and I rang the alarm . Then why were you wearing a gas mask ? It was a stressful situation . We gave him some oxygen . Now if you have no further questions ... Do you have any idea what they were after ? Fortunately for all of us there 's nothing here that would have been useful to them . And I think Frank here has been through enough . You 're right . I apologize . If you think of anything else . Now I 'd like to see those tanks . Of course . Halo will take Piron to the next level . It will change everything ! It 's like a health monitor but it 's so much more than that . You wear it on your wrist and it can tell you everything . I mean , it can tell you if ... It 's alright . Just wait a second . Said you never wanted to see me again . Trying to make sure that you don 't . What convicted felons can 't travel internationally . They can when wounded ex-boyfriends get out of their way . How is life with the romantic time-traveling me ? Enjoying your stay at the honeymoon suite at the bed bug motel ? Do you know which one of us you 're punishing ? I like you on a leash , Emily . It keeps him in line as well . You 've read my file . You know what I 've done . What I 'm capable of . Cut us loose or next time I cut you . Leashes break , Alec . This plant mostly makes agricultural products . Herbicides . Fertilizers . Not even the weapons-grade ammonium nitrate stuff . In my time Sonmanto grows food . Develops medicines , vaccines . Even saved my life , once . Mr. Richardson , what 's in these tanks ? Uh ... waste . We ship it out bi-weekly . What kind of waste ? By-product of an experimental high-yield agent . It 's completely benign . Would you like the patent number ? Is it included in your inventory ? No . There are a couple of apple cores probably in recycling box 2 , so long as we 're being thorough . Mr. Richardson , I 'm going to need to see security footage from the break-in . Certainly . Alec , are you there ? I need your help . What kind of waste ? I have a chemical trace signature . Can you analyze it ? Alright , send it over . You should have called the other guy . I wanted to talk to you . Explain everything that 's been going on . It 's a mix of different chemicals . Usually found in crop cultivation . Can you tell me if it 's dangerous ? You never know what 's dangerous until you do . Alec . I had to figure out who ... if he ... Kiera , listen . These chemicals you found , the waste . If it 's mixed with hydrogen sulfide gas and manganese dioxide , its effects on the human body can be catastrophic . Are these compounds hard to get ? Not at all . If you can 't buy straight up sulfide dioxide , you can make it with insect repellant and toilet cleaner . Manganese dioxide is found in most household batteries . Mix that with the waste and you 've got a bio-weapon . A truck full of this stuff and the right equipment and you 've got the mother of all chemical weapons . Liber8 's gonna poison the whole city . We need to find an antidote . You know there 's a difference between predictive modeling and actual hard science . We don 't have time for tests , Alec . We have to act fast in case Liber8 does . Alright Piron has chemists , I can task them with this . Thank you , Alec . I 'm not doing it for you . I don 't care who you 're doing it for . I 'm just glad you 're here , that 's all . I 'll be in touch . Okay , there 's the truck pulling in . Well you sure scared them away . Betty never got a hit on any truck . We have to find out where they went before it 's too late . Too late for what ? Your harmless waste can be weaponized . So elegant yet so deadly . It 's deadly ? Right now ? Not yet . Not until it 's mixed with the activator and exposed to air . It 's not a good time . Alec , we 've got Liber8 on the run with biochemical waste and a stolen tanker truck . I 'm not sure I 'm your guy . You have to be . The other one is already working on an antidote if worse comes to worst . So two Alec 's are better than one . Finally . Assuming you 've scanned police reports ? We have , it 's ongoing . Nothing yet . Let me see what I can find . Three drops will do . Will do what ? Well it 'll kill you . Me . Travis . Him too . So don 't expose it to air ? Good thing you 're here . Clock 's ticking . Let 's go . Alright found something . Liber8 must have scrubbed all identifying marks from the trucks . But there 's residue of an aerial ID number . Cross-referencing now . Evergreen Petroleum owns that hazmat tanker . That 's weird . Why wouldn 't they report it stolen ? We 'll find out . Thanks Alec . Kiera , before you go I just wanted to say ... Goodbye ... Hey . So the missing truck belongs to Ever ... Evergreen Petroleum . Yeah . I know . I asked you to look into that truck two and a half hours ago . Sadler found it in 5 minutes and 4 mouse clicks . You playing games , Betty ? Are you accusing me of ... Giving Liber8 more time to get away ? Yes . I am . Carlos . Easy . You 've got a man on me . Check my work . 17 companies in the Lower Mainland running the kind of truck you specified . I called every one of them . Evergreen was fourth . And what 'd they tell you ? That nothing was missing . Then a warehouse manager found a GPS unit lying on the ground at a loading dock in Ladner . Liber8 was smart , they knew how to disconnect it . That was half an hour ago . Alright . Carlos ... I 'm not finished . I called hospitals looking for the driver . He was at Delta hospital with a concussion . He never saw who jumped him , but his cell phone was left in the glove compartment . Still on ? Yes . Can I get back to tracking the phone 's GPS now ? That 's what I was coming to tell you . Yeah . I 've narrowed it to a 15-block radius in East Vancouver . I 'm going to to cross-reference it with other providers but I should have a fix in seven maybe eight minutes . Okay , alert ERT and send it to the car . And Betty ? As soon as I 've got it , you 've got it . You might want to lose the attitude . I was hoping for a quieter approach . Yeah well , invisible Kiera 's kinda hard to explain to a dozen witnesses . Given what we might be up against in there , I think caution is the best option . You know , for show . Police ! Freeze ! Don 't . Liber8 yourself . No ! Help ! Everybody get out , now ! Run ! Kiera ! Kiera . You are lucky to be alive . What about the ERT ? They 're all accounted for but the perps are all dead . Maybe that super suit of yours comes with 9 lives . What are we missing here ? Not sure . You know , maybe Alec could help . Or Alec could help . They 're both helping already . Double-team . Fantastic . Something 's up , Carlos Travis and Sonia are long gone . Presumably with the weapon . It 's Betty . Hey , what 's up ? We 've got a situation developing at Sonmanto corporate headquarters . Looks like we 've got our answer . Thanks . Okay it 'll take half an hour to get to the farm . Once he realizes that Mom didn 't call , it 'll be too late . You get in and out as fast as you can . Don 't be a hero . Get what Kellogg wants and we 'll meet back at the rendezvous . We go to him together . Then we leave for good . Okay , got it . Look , if something goes wrong ... It won 't . But if it does ... We talked about this . Just don 't let him catch you . Catch who ? See you soon . You will . Good afternoon Mr. Sadler . Mr. Sadler ! Are you forgetting something . We have the new protocol now sir ? Keep up the good work . Alec , I 'm going to put you on speaker . What have you got ? My chemists say the sequencing is slow . I 'm throwing teraflops of power at it . There 's no good news yet . I had the ME send you the file on one of the gas victims . Did you get it ? Yeah it went out to my team . They say it presents like a neurotoxin that 's targeting the circulatory system . And these veins ? They 're like something from a Japanese horror movie . Purple veins ? Yeah just bursting through his skin , all over his body . Solution 16 . It 's a battleground poison used in the frontier wars of 2066 . I may know what this is . What , chemical weapons are legal in the future ? They 're effective . They get used . So Liber8 's figured out how to manufacture it using Sonmanto 's waste chemicals ? And that 's why we need the antidote Alec . We don 't have much time . Kiera I 'll notify you when I have something . Turn the car around . The press was tipped off . Bet that 's our missing chemical waste . We need to clear the area . If they decide to trigger an explosion , there won 't be anywhere to hide . Can somebody please explain to me why there 's a media circus here ahead of this department ? # Liber8Exposes They 're tweeting this ? Over 200,000 followers . Liber8 theatrics . But to what end ? Why go to all this trouble and then just ditch the truck here ? The symbolism . They 're dropping toxic waste that can be weaponized on Sonmanto 's doorstep . Ladies and gentlemen of the press . My name is Gord Solomon and I am the legal representative for the group known as Liber8 . Alright , that 's it . No , hold on . Let 's see what he 's up to . Inside this truck is a chemical waste by-product . Although you wouldn 't want to spread it on your vegetable patch , in its current state it 's benign . But if you simply add a few common household chemicals to this Sonmanto drudge , it becomes a poisonous gas that can be used in chemical attacks . Easy Agent Cameron . You don 't want to ... oh ! You getting this ? I have a message for you . They said you would know , and I quote , the future ramifications of this . You 're an errand boy for terrorists . Liber8 wants you all to know that Sonmanto is creating a dangerous weapon for use in a chemical attack ! That is Liber8 's handiwork ! Sonmanto is well aware of the potential for weaponization . In fact , they 're already profiting from this stuff . Enough . Let 's get Mr. Solomon out of here and please let 's move the press back . Can these accusations be proven ? You 're the so-called free press ! Find out for yourselves . Liber8 frees ! Freedom of information . Stand down . Freedom of information . Hey , you okay ? I survived the warehouse because I 'm immunized . Tens of thousands of people . My friends died in agony . Sonmanto created the cure . Don 't tell me they also made the ... Let 's get you out of here . I was in combat when that chemical was used against my platoon . It was the most excruciating pain I 've ever felt . And Sonmanto saved me when I thought I was past saving . Liber8 knows that . But they think they know something more . Remember when Richardson insisted that Sonmanto hadn 't lost anything in those safety deposit heists ? Well what if this kind of information is exactly what they lost . What do you mean ? Well corporations spy on other corporations all the time , right ? Now Liber8 broke into those boxes . What if they stole that espionage ? It would explain why they went after the Fermitas server as well . In this time , companies are still in competition . There is no corporate congress . That 's what Liber8 is trying to stop . And we can 't prove any of it . Hold on . Alec ? It 's about chemical waste . What about it ? Is there any way to find out if Sonmanto has weaponized it ? I thought you needed a cure ? I need both . But you can wait for this though right ? You mean wait until it 's actually used on somebody ? Alright let 's see . It 's like spy versus spy . Piron has files on everyone here . Anything on Derek Richardson or Sonmanto . Let me see . Richardson went to Dubai . Oh wow . You 're gonna want to read this . I 'll send it to your CMR . Can you send it to Carlos as well ? Yeah you got it . You asshole . You can 't stop stealing from me . First you steal my life now you are stealing my files . Alec ? Alec ? Carlos I have to go . Yeah . Holy shit . We 've got Liber8 calling us the bad guys . It 's like we 're in that ... what 's that Superman thing ? Bizarro World . It 's where good is bad , bad is good . That 's it , detective . But in this world , you said your company had no idea about the possible weaponization of your waste material . That 's right . Then why were you meeting with Chechen separatists in Dubai three months ago ? I was in Dubai for a bio-engineering conference . And I had no such meetings . So cryptic communication between you and Jihadi leadership ? That 's not true either ? Definitely not . When were you planning on selling the antidote ? Or were you just going to hold out for a better price ? You are siding with terrorists and their lies , officer . I 'm siding with the truth . For once , Liber8 did a little good . They lifted up the mat , and you crawled out . I 'm taking you in . What are you taking from me now ? All you have to do is let us go . I 'm not stopping you . Emily has a warrant . She can 't leave because of it . I can 't have any access to my bank accounts . MY accounts . We can 't get passports . And it 's against the law to get a fake passport . Look at you . Look what she 's turned you into . This isn 't us . Look , just let me walk out of here . It 's going to be impossible to explain anything else . It seems possible to explain anything when you have enough power and money . You idiot ! You 're still in love with Emily . Hardly . I can access every file in your directory except for the one on her . You have her locked up tight , so yeah , you are . But she 's done with you . What you think you 're some better version of me ? Alec 2.0 ? There 's nothing stopping me from having you taken away . I can think of a dozen ... No . We 're not that kind of people . You have no idea what kind of people I am . You 're going to wipe that file right now . Alright I 'm going now . Stay sitting . You know you 're not going to get out of here . I am . You 're not going to do it . Like I said , you have no idea . Drop it . Kiera , he trapped Emily and he trapped me . All we want to do is leave . He tried to kill me . He 's twisting everything . He screwed me over . It 's not me . Is he dead ? Sedated . I need to get him out of here quickly and covertly . What are you going to do with him ? He won 't bother you again . Thank you . I 'm on your side , Alec . You need to know that . Alright yeah let me know what you find out . Richardson stood pat . Won 't admit to anything and said he 'd take his day in court . Yeah I 'm good with that . We got enough . Maybe . Sonmanto has deep pockets and the crown attorney has a shallow sack . Richardson and Sonmanto are criminals . They 're selling chemical weapons . I have a more immediate problem with that shitstorm that you created in front of the press . Don 't you mean Kiera 's shitstorm ? When Richardson accused you of siding with Liber8 , he queued up the leading soundbite for tonight 's news . That 's not what I was doing . But that 's how it 's going to look . You 'll catch up on some paperwork while we wait out this news cycle . What you got me riding a desk because the wrong people uncovered the truth ? You are a public servant . You chase down criminals . You don 't suggest they might be right . About anything . Freedom of speech ! You have it . You just don 't get to practice it in front of the cameras . Of all the corporate hypocrites , Sonmanto might be the worst . They 'd even had me fooled . Well that 's part of the victory . Sonmanto won 't be seen as the hero . Not in this time . Not ever . We changed history baby . Yeah we 'll they 're still going to be making that poison . People are still going to die . No . They 're not . Because we 're going to beat them to the antidote by 50 years . Roll up your sleeve . Why ? During the war when Sonmanto finally released a remedy for 16 , like all military personnel you got the shot right ? Yeah . Eventually . Standard procedure . Which means the antivirus is still in your system . And we 're going to be giving it away for free . This is as far as you go . Where are you taking him ? You already know . No . Kiera ! Why are you bringing him to me ? You wanted him neutralized . I got him off the street . He doesn 't have to die . Then you 're sure this is the right choice . He 's admitted he doesn 't want to pursue his destiny . He 's turned violent . Obsessive . What happens to him now ? I know sacrifices are hard Kiera , but eventually we all have to make them . There is a big difference between sacrifice and betrayal . We may not have been seeing eye-to-eye but I just betrayed my friend . A friend who betrayed you first . He was following his heart . Something I should do more often . I almost forgot . Does this mean we 're done ? I 'd hoped we were sealing a trust . There 's still work to do . Liber8 is still in play . And we have to find the other time device . Which we should discover soon enough . When you were CPS it felt good to be a part of something , didn 't it ? Yes . The VPD can never be that for you . But you could have a home , here with us . Kiera ? Kiera what 's wrong . It 's you . I knew it . Ugh ! Kiera ! Are you behind this ? Behind what ? Have you lost your mind ? What are you doing ? Curtis , is the one that killed me . And now I 'm going to return the favour . Kiera you have to stop . This is crazy . Is that true , Curtis ? Are you a freelancing freelancer ? I 've never found you funny .

 A possible Red Flag prisoner is in our offices . Cameron said that he and Nina had him subdued , and now they 're bringing him here . I thought Sullivan wanted an approach and evaluate . See if the man is an Alpha or any Red Flag connections . Clearly things went another way . So we still don 't know what his ability is ? No . Well , it 's a good thing we got this thing up and running . 19 , 68 , 16 , 7 . That 's not your birthday , is it ? Super bowl III . Jets beat the Colts 16-7 . Yeah , but you couldn 't have been old enough to have been there . I was six months old . I even have a photo of my dad holding me while he was watching the game , so that makes me a Jets fan for life , baby . And we 're coming . You see what we did last year , right ? Yeah , that 's football , right , Bill ? Uh , yeah , football . Anyway , so we got bulletproof , polarized glass . We 've got industrial-grade surge suppressors , fire-retardant foam . And the best part is we got an emergency lockdown , the whole office . So the windows , doors , everything shut . Now , if only we can get D.O.D. to buy us a new car . Can they do that ? Oh , gosh , Bill , I-I don 't know . I 've allowed this to go so far beyond what I envisioned for all of us . Doc , you got to get over that . We 're not longer just your patients . We 're a government asset . What 's the expression , dance with the devil in the pale moonlight ? You got to go with the flow , right ? Isn 't that what you always tell me ? Look , ever since that mess with Jonas Englin , I 've lost my ability- - I 'm here , right ? I 'm good with it . You 're good with it , so- - No , I 'm not all that good with it . It 's not who you are , and the D.O.D. isn 't happy either . Actually , I 'm trying to figure out a way to get the ability back . You 're a fine investigator , Bill , but as far as the government 's concerned , we are a group of Alphas . Well , you 're not an Alpha . You 're still here , right ? - And besides , Doc ... - Huh ? Jeannie and I are thinking about renovating the kitchen . So , please , keep those checks coming . This isn 't gonna work . This isn 't gonna work . They ignored my checklist . I made a detailed list . Sleep gas dispensers and telepathy blockers and some automated gun turrets . Gary , those things don 't exist . Yeah , I like the old Bill better . You 'd take things seriously , and your veins would pop out when things weren 't right , and this isn 't right . Why aren 't your veins popping out anymore ? I don 't have to worry about that anymore . Why are you still here , then ? You 're not even an Alpha anymore . If I wasn 't here , you 'd miss me , right ? You being gone and you being different are the same thing . Whatever , Bill . Whatever . Ow . Ow ! I got it . Are you hearing me ? What was that noise ? Check , over ? Bill , Ten-four ? Uh , Rachel , this is not a police radio . - You can speak normally . - Okay . I hear them . They 're in the elevator with Dr. Kern . All right , thanks . Sorry about this . Were able to confirm any Red Flag connection ? We barely sat down before he got suspicious . What about an Alpha ability ? I tried to push him , but it just didn 't work . I want to run some MRIs first , then we can put him in the holding cell . Let 's move fast before he wakes up . Doc , you okay ? Uh , yeah . It 's just , um ... ? Alphas 1x09 ? Blind Spot Original Air Date on September 12 , 2011 ? Don 't say no ? ? for an answer ? ? and there 's no telling ? ? where we 've been ? ? ? ? ' cause people don 't understand ? ? understand , understand ? ? people don 't understand ? ? people like me ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = = Please don 't wake him up . Relax , Rachel . You know I still have my gun , and I am a better shot when I 'm not all amped up . You know , Bill , I was thinking , if I dosed you with a mixture of adrenaline and steroids , we might be able to jump-start your ability . Doc , I am not interested . All that got me was issues , right ? Marriage issues , work issues and- - No , I-I understand your concerns . Who needs it ? We might . We all have our issues , but we 're learning how to control them . Yeah , well , I 'm all in control now . Thank you very much . All right , let 's see what we have here . Paperwork already ? God , you 're so motivated . I used to ignore it and pretend it would go away , but it never did . Cream , no sugar , right ? I pay attention . I wonder what tipped Kern off to us . Guy 's an obstetrician . He sees happy couples all the time . I guess he didn 't see that in us . And what , we don 't buy the whole happy-couple thing ? No , look , I 'm not saying that . Rosen thinks that it 's a bad idea , you and me . Wait a minute . You told him ? Well , he 's our shrink . Why , is it because , um ... because I 'm divorced and in A.A. ? Or maybe it 's because I have a kid . We work together . It would be unprofessional . No , we do things in this job all the time that are unprofessional , and you know that . That 's not it . He thinks that I 'd be bad for you , and ... He might be right . Cam , I 've screwed up every relationship I 've ever had . Me too . So we 're perfect for each other . Hey , guys . Um , Doc found something . We got a meeting . Yeah , we 're on our way . How can Kern be blind ? Because he has no optic nerve . The MRI revealed something , uh , well , pretty interesting . It 's as if they never developed . So , even if his eyes were functioning properly , as they appear to be , no visual data would ever reach his brain . Which is why I couldn 't push him . He couldn 't see me . Look , when things got ugly , that guy dodged around his desk , and he ran straight for the door . There is no way he 's blind . Well , unless he 's an Alpha , which I have some ideas about , uh , but I need to run a few more tests . So we 're talking about a blind Alpha that 's a baby Doc and a member of Red Flag ? Where 's my phone ? Who 's got my phone ? Bill ? Bill ! Bill ! Gary , I 've been here the whole time . What are you talking about ? Yeah , where 'd you put my phone ? Gary , I 've been here the whole time . Gary , your phone is right here . Oh , well , that 's not okay . People shouldn 't be touching my phone . It was a gift . It 's special . Yes , okay , and it 's back in your hands . - It 's fine . - Yeah . No , it 's not , 'cause it 's open to data files , and those are private . Yes , Gary 's phone is private . Please , no one is to touch it unless they have Gary 's permission , all right ? Yeah , and the answer 's no . To get back to our case , the reason Dr. Kern is here- - D.O.D. suspects that he 's been doing some sort of research , and they are hoping that we can figure out why . And more to the point , a radicalized Alpha who is also an obstetrician , that 's a disturbing thought to say the least . Well , we cleaned out his office- - hard drive , cell phone , patient files . Meds , vitamins , blood samples . Which , Rachel , you 'll take a look at ? Yeah . That 's great . And , Gary , you will look into the cell phone and computer transmissions ? That 's just data mining . People without abilities can data-mine . Well , you know , we all can 't do that . - I can 't do it , Gary . - Neither can I. No , we all know that you are so much more than your abilities , Gary . - You have very many talents . - I know . I 'm amazing . My lucky day . Gary ? Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Did you call me ? I 'm working . Do not disturb , that 's my I.M. chat status . I should get a sign . Hey , Gary , were you just there by my office ? Rachel , you 're not making sense . I told you , I 'm working . I work in my office . Bill , will you remove the mouth strap ? You sure ? Yes , I have the test results I need . I just would like to speak with him . Okay , whatever . Let me tell you something ... Happiness is a warm gun . And mine is a Sig 226 . You got me ? I want my lawyer . Yeah , and I want a Reuben sandwich . I 'll have my lawyer pick you up one . Well , unfortunately , Doctor Kern , you 're being detained because of suspected involvement with a terrorist organization . The only organization I belong to is the A.M.A. So , what , Alphas , ability , Red Flag- - that means nothing to you ? Bill , will you take the cuffs off , stand him up , and have him face the glass ? Get up slowly . Keep your arms up . Turn around and face the wall , please . What is this , a cavity check ? That 's just as I thought ... sonar , echolocation . - So he 's like a bat ? - Or a dolphin . You can sit down now . So that 's how you see ... Very interesting . You have no optic nerves . However , the audio-processing capabilities of your brain , your voice box , the chambers in your sinus passages are all significantly enhanced . You 're an Alpha . But of course you already know that . This isn 't going to end well . Is that a threat ? Hey , Cley , Rosen and I are going to keep working with him , and Rachel 's nosing around through what we found in his office . Yeah , Rosen thinks that he 's probably said about as much as he 's going to , so why don 't you come scoop him up ? All right , what , two hours ? From Knoxville ? All right , have a safe flight . Doc , can we talk ? I 'm a bit busy , Cameron , can we- - No , it won 't take long . Look , I just wanted to say , um , me and Nina ... If you just give us a little space and let us figure some things out for ourselves ... I 'm only trying to look out for the both of you . Well , I get that , but we 're adults . We get to make our own mistakes , so , please , just let it go . I 'd like to , but as your psychiatrist and your employer , I don 't think I can do that . And I don 't think you 're in a place to make that decision . Am I interrupting ? I 'm always interrupting . I 'm sorry , but I found something in the box I was going through . It 's important . Here , look at these . " Building blocks for a better baby . " Yeah , they 're vitamins for pregnant women . I decided to break one open and take a look inside- - you know , really take a look . Rachel , what did you find ? DNA ... active human DNA inside the vitamins . Active human DNA introduced into a developing fetus could cause multiple birth defects , severe mutations . Yeah , that 's what I was worried about . Hold on a second . I smell blood ... in the hallway . Nina . It just started bleeding . I haven 't had one of these since I was a kid . Oh , gosh , look up . Are you dizzy ? - No , it 's okay . - Headache or anything ? It was just a few broken capillaries , nothing serious , but were you picking ? I don 't pick . Here , take this . You 'll be fine . Just clean it up , okay ? Yeah . Good . Are you aware you have mitral valve prolapse- - three millimeters of displacement ? You just did an ultrasound of my chest . You should get that looked at . Well , I have a heart exam twice a year . I 'm monitoring it , but , uh ... thank you for your concern , though . Like you , I took an oath ... do no harm . I may be an Alpha , but I 'm a doctor first . I hope you 'll keep that in mind . No harm . What kind of doctor gives active human DNA to pregnant women ? Someone who cares about the future . Whose future ? You 're aware of Renestrin- - new drug that allegedly prevents birth defects ? But what it really does is interferes with the fetal development of more evolved children . What you 're really saying is it prevents babies from being born as Alphas . Consider my special vitamins the counteragent . Are you planning to distribute your counteragent all by yourself ? Can any of your team read minds ? No . Well , I guess there 's some questions that aren 't meant to be answered . Dr. Rosen , I know what 's going to happen next . Men with guns will whisk me away to some government facility . That would be a tragic , tragic error . Well , I 'm afraid the real tragedy is you choosing to join a terrorist organization . Red Flag isn 't as monolithic as you think it is . Well , regardless of its scope , you and your friends tried to assassinate me . Fringe elements , radicals , not representative of the mainstream . You know , it 's amazing how often people use that term- - " fringe elements . " Hmm . Occurs to me that the I.R.A. , P.L.O. , K.K.K.- - all fringe elements whose very existence depends upon the support of their mainstream fellow travelers . I 've read your field reports , Doctor . You advocate a future where Alphas and normal humans cooperate for the common good . That 's the future I want . We should be working together , comparing notes . You 're inviting me to join Red Flag ? I 'm afraid I don 't meet their entry requirements . I see a time coming soon where the unenhanced will be able to join our cause . That 's where you belong . Dr. Kern , if you 're willing to disclose what exactly it is you 're up to , I 'm willing to intervene on your behalf . Impasse . I 'm disappointed for you , Doctor . Well ... I 'm not the one going to Binghamton . What makes you think I am ? Bill ? Hicks ? Come on , guys , this better not be a joke . This guy 's holding out on us . Any ideas how we break him down ? - Well , he 's sonic guy , right ? - Yeah . Maybe it 's time we pull out the Captain Tennille 's Muskrat Love . - Sonic warfare . - Mm-hmm . Yeah , it 's been known to work . Just remember , anything we force him to listen to we got to hear it as well . Trust me , we used the same trick on detainees in Bagram . Still feel sick every time I hear Copacabana . - I love that song . - Oh , come on . I do . It 's one of my favorites . You hear that ? Gary screwing with the computers again ? I can 't get in the system . It seems like it 's running some sort of keypad retrieval . - Have you seen Rachel ? - No , not lately . She 's not in her office , and no one 's seen her for a half hour . Why don 't you scream for her ? Yeah , I did , okay ? She 's gone . What ? - Rachel ? - Rachel ? Rachel , if you can hear us , say something . Nothing , nothing . There 's something wrong with the security cameras . Gary , come here , come here . Show me what you 're looking at . - Pull it up on the monitor . - Okay , it 's glitchy . Give me Rachel 's office an hour ago . Something 's making it glitch . Yeah . Okay , okay , there she is , in her office going over the stuff from Kern . Can--can you fast-forward ? It 's glitchy , though . It 's glitchy . Okay , wait , wait . Here , here . And then she leaves . Oh , no , wait , wait . I found her . 20 minutes ago . There . There . Hicks ! Nina ! Stay here . This way . Rachel ! Rachel ? Rachel , where are you ? This is the last place she was seen on camera , right ? Yeah . Rachel ! - Oh , my God . - What ? Over here . It 's blood , and it- - I got blood here , too . Okay , and these look like drag marks , right ? Starting over there . No , they start here . Well , she couldn 't have just evaporated . What the hell ? Rachel , where are you ? Rachel ? Hey , take a look at this . Was this like this when we moved in ? What are you doing ? Where 's Rachel ? Rachel ? Which one 's Rachel , the tall one ? - The other woman . - I never met her . You can do more with your sonar than just find things . I 'm chained to a table . I can 't run around abducting people with my voice . Besides , my hearing is quite good . The number of heartbeats on this floor hasn 't changed since I awoke . How many are you hearing ? Do we really have to play this ridiculous game ? There are eight . There have always been eight . Yours , mine , and the six members of your team , I assume . We haven 't been properly introduced . Dr. Kern , there are only six of us , that includes Rachel and myself . Plus you , that 's seven . What ? Have things ... Have things gone missing around your office ... Strange sounds , computers turning on randomly , people sensing someone nearby without ever seeing anyone ? You have an unwelcome guest . What are you saying , That--that Rachel 's been kidnapped and that the person is still here in the building ? Let me solve your problem . Let me help you , or we 're all dead . Why should I believe anything you say ? All right , don 't . Don 't . But one member of your team is down already . Ignore me , things will only get worse . Let me out ! Before it 's too late , let me out ! You need to let me out ! I 'm the only one who can keep us alive . Don 't need to hear that . I don 't trust that guy for a second . Look , I searched the entire office again- - still no Rachel . And we got nothing to go on except what Kern is saying . I can 't wait for Cley to show up and get this guy out of here . Not until we find Rachel . Yeah , I think we- - we should at least consider what Kern is saying . An intruder would certainly explain some of the strange things that have been happening here . Hey , Doc , earlier today , I thought I was imagining something , right ? But I felt that someone was watching me . I turned around , and there was no one there . Exactly , Bill . That is called proprioception . It 's one of the ways we have of processing the million bits of information in our environment around us . Like you said , if you find yourself in a room full of people , you sense something . Then you feel compelled to turn around , and they 're looking right at you . That 's our proprioception at work . So our proprioception says someone 's here , but our eyes say there isn 't . Yes , well , unlike Rachel , when we 're looking for something , we rely on our vision . But vision can be deceptive . How many dots do you see ? Two . All right , now hold this with your right hand . All right , close your left eye . Look at this dot and move the paper slowly towards you . One of the dots just disappeared . Into your blind spot . You 've all heard of one . We all have one . It 's a hole or gap in our visual landscape which exists because of the way our brains are wired . And we might be dealing with an Alpha who can exploit this phenomenon . Okay , let 's say that there is an Alpha here , right , that does that- - how do they get into that gap ? Bill , I don 't know . They might be able to send a signal that swells the optic nerves , thereby expanding collectively the blind spot and move into it so nobody can see them . I still don 't buy it . I mean , there 's cameras everywhere . An Alpha might be able to mess with our brain , but how does he get past the cameras ? The cameras are glitched . Someone 's made them glitchy . There 's dropped frames and time lag . Enough to get around without being seen ? Yes , yes . But it 's only our cameras . It 's only the cameras inside this building . Yeah , the camera across the street looks into this building every 15 minutes . And that 's why I won 't go to the bathroom at three minutes after or at 18 or 33 or 48 , yeah . Gary , Gary , Gary , come on . Okay , watch this . Who is that woman ? Wait . Who 's that woman ? Hicks , behind you ! Where 'd she go ? I can 't see her . Cameron ? Hicks , what happened ? I never even saw her . This isn 't good . That 's a lot of red . Get a pressure bandage on that right away . Come on , she 's activating the blast door ! Password 's been changed . Well , all the phones aren 't working either or the Internet . Yeah , and Rachel 's missing . Hicks is on the D.L. Even if Cley gets here in time , he couldn 't get in . Don 't worry about that now . Maybe Gary can override the lock system . That 's worth a try . Ah , stupid security glass ! Gary ? Gary , what are you doing ? I 'm using two chairs . - Gary , no . - I tried one chair . Now I 'm using two . - Gary , Gary- - No , Dr. Rosen , I used one chair . - I 'm speaking to you , Gary . - Yeah , let me use the chairs . I need your help . Will you come with me ? - I am helping . - Come with me , please . It won 't kill you , but no bouncing off the ceilings for a few days , okay ? Well , I 'm glad someone paid attention during the first-aid class Harken made us take . Okay , come on , come on . We got to find Rachel . I 'll get Rosen to give you some pain pills . Addict . Sorry . Not good for you . Don 't care . That witch took my phone . - What witch ? - The witch ! That 's the word my mom uses when she 's angry . She uses another word , too . She took Rachel , and she took my phone . The bitch got my gun . - I think it 's from- - - That sounded like my gun . - Bulletproof glass ... - Gary . Excellent idea . - It 's crackly . - Gary . Do you have my phone ? Do you have Rachel ? Gary , Gary , I need you to see if you can get the computer systems back online . - Don 't leave his side . - Got it . - Cameron . - Rachel--I 'm on it . - This just in my gut . - Hey , hey , where is she ? Where 's blind spot girl ? You mean the person who just tried to shoot me ? Or free you . I say " day , " you say " night . " We 're never going to find common ground like this . Yeah , you want common ground , why don 't you start with a name ? Griffin . Her name is Griffin , but I suspect it 's a nom de guerre . Red Flag considers her an unsanctioned variable . What exactly does that mean ? Someone who sells their services to the highest bidder but supports no cause , has no allegiance . A person should believe in something , don 't you think ? You two I respect . Even though you 're wrong , at least you 're loyal to a cause greater than yourselves . So you 're saying that she 's just a mercenary doing anything for money ? My ability can be extremely useful in finding her , not to mention your missing compatriot , Rachel . - Rachel , yes . - I don 't think so . Then you guys waltz out of here laughing your asses off . Good try . Does it look like I 'm laughing ? Griffin 's after me . She 'll do whatever it takes to get me , including killing all of you . Look , either you 're a target , or you 're an accomplice , but either way , you 're staying right where you are until we hand you over to Cley . Rachel . The blast door- - I can 't get it open . Why do we always have to fight other people with abilities ? It 's annoying . I guess I 'm not meant to be normal , huh ? I 'm sorry , Bill . I hoped we 'd have more time to talk , but- - you know , weigh the pros and cons and let you have more time to make your own decision about this . You know , when you used to talk to me like this , it used to make me cranky . Well , I 'm afraid it will again . So the decision has been made for me . How long 's it take ? Should take effect immediately . All right , let 's give this sucker a test-drive . Come on , Bill . I can do this . I can do this . You should be able to by now . The drugs should be kicking in . Doc , it 's not happening . It 's not happening . Look , I 'm not sweating , right ? My heart rate feels normal . I 'm not feeling any rush or- - - Do you want to ? - Of course I want to . No , that 's not what I 'm asking you . What are you saying ? You think it 's in my head ? Well , your ability to do this has always been linked to an emotional state of yours . You can 't have one without the other . We are not gonna die because I can 't get this up . Well , that should make you angry . All right , all right , stop . Stop , stop . Stop . Stop . You can 't do this , all right ? It 's okay . Now , we can 't find Rachel . And I think we 're going about this the wrong way . I think we need to go on the offensive . Are you sure this is going to work ? That 's it , break up the patterns . The more abstract the background , the harder it should be for Griffin to blend in . It 's messy . I know Gary , but we 're gonna clean it up , Gary , I promise . Gary , move . Gary , Gary , move , move . I am . I am . Gary , stay right here by- - sit down by that pillar . Okay , camera 's on . Ten cameras . Nina , be careful . You bleeding again ? No , it 's fine . We 'll get Rosen to look at it , okay ? Over here . Look behind you . She 's running . - There ! - Where ? Footprints in the creamer . Gary get in your office . Lock the door . She 's in the MRI room . Nina , get back here . Where is she ? Where 'd she go ? It 's a trap ! Bill , that door . Get out . Oh my God , Gary . Gary ? Damn it , she 's got us . Gary ! Gary ! Open up , Gary ! Gary , get to your office and lock the door . - Gary ! - Okay . Son of a bitch . Gary ! D.C.I.S. don 't move ! Stop hiding . Come out . Open up ! Stop hiding . Okay , you 're only making it worse for yourself . Just please- - you have to stop hiding . D.C.I.S. you 're under arrest . Stop hiding ! D.C.I.S. you 're under arrest now . - Go to your office ! - Please , stop . You have to stop , please . Stop , please , don 't ! - Hey ! - No , no . Oh , that felt so good . Gary , are you okay ? So how do you do this- - fool our brains so we can 't see you ? I 've never given it much thought . Why don 't you cut me loose , and we can figure it out together ? I could even give you a demonstration if you 'd like . Didn 't think so . Kern referred to you as an unsanctioned variable . Hmm . I prefer Ronin . Sounds cooler . I mean , I 've been following him for two weeks , and then you lot scooped him up , so thanks for that . Why don 't you just let me take Kern and leave ? It 's the easiest solution to your problem . Well , that 's interesting . He says we should release him to stop you , that you 're our problem . And you don 't know who to believe , huh ? You seen your walls lately ? What are you talking about , the cracks ? Yeah , we noticed some cracks on the beams . There are cracks everywhere . You got a sonic Alpha in your holding cell . He 's trying to break out of here . And he 's been trying since the minute he woke up . These vibrations , well ... They take time to build . Yeah , I don 't trust her . For all we know , she 's working with Kern . I 'm sorry about the knife , handsome . See , I don 't like it when people get close to me . I don 't like it when they can see me either . That 's why Kern 's so annoying- - the sonar . Who are you working for ? Let 's just say it 's someone that 's interested in Kern 's research . His so-called vitamins ? Look , I get paid for delivering Kern 's research , which I 've already gotten off your computers . I get a bonus for bringing in Kern . I can 't do that if I 'm dead . Let 's just call a truce . You let me take him out of here . I get my fee . You get to live . We all win . Hicks . Dr. Rosen , he 's bleeding again . Come with me . Still bleeding . What 's going on ? It 's probably the vibrations . It 's okay . It 's not like I 'm dying or anything . You don 't want Doc here thinking you actually care about me . Very funny . Scissors . Doc , Doc , take a look . - Look . - Give me this . Right there . Oh , my goodness . I can hear the rumbles . It 's getting worse . Doc . Doc , I think you need to take a look at him . I wasn 't hurting anyone . Don 't make me hurt you . Whatever happens to us is gonna happen to you . If you bring this whole building down- - All I wanted was to bring more Alphas into the world . Why is that wrong ? Why are you treating me like a criminal ? Bill , Bill , we 've got to get inside there and stop him . - Here , take this . - What is this ? Ether . It 's not elegant , but it 's quick . Aah ! It 's hot as hell . He 's turned the cell into a reverb chamber . It 's shaking the whole building , and it 's creating heat . The metal might be at the breaking point . Dr. Rosen ! Duck and cover . Bill , duck and cover . Gary ? Gary , watch her . Yeah , okay , I 'll do both . I 'll watch , and I 'll cover . I 'll cover us . He 's lost too much blood . We got to get him out of here . Hicks , come on , come on . - Take him to the blast door . - Yeah . I 'll find Rosen . Who hired you ? I was told to bring you in alive , but that 's never gonna happen . Who hired you ? No ! It 's too late ! So much for my bonus . You know , a man with your abilities could make a lot of money if he went into business for himself . That 's never gonna happen . Yeah ? Well , I owe you one . And I hate owing people . So I 'll pay you back . Stanton Parish . What the hell is that ? You better find out . Who knew office work was so dangerous , huh ? Stanton Parish ? Yeah , yeah . It was something that , uh , Griffin threw at me as a parting gift , I guess . I don 't know . Maybe it 's a place , a person . - I don 't know . - Well , we 'll look into it . Yeah , well , the sooner the better , Doc . I told you that we needed gun turrets , Bill . You know what ? I talked to your mother and asked her , could we fight Alphas in your bedroom ? And she said no . What 's up with that ? That 's not helpful , bill . My house would be the worst place to fight . And anyway , my bedroom 's off-limits . Gary , no , that 's a great place . I think , you know , we can keep them as prisoners there or- - Yeah , yeah , I know what you 're trying to do , Bill . You 're trying to annoy me , but it 's not gonna work . You know , you were a lot less annoying when you didn 't have your abilities . And now that you 've got your ability back , you 're annoying again . You 're Bill again . You 're the old Bill . You 're damn right I am . Nina , you don 't have to clean up my office . Yeah , well , don 't want your wound to open up . Rachel would smell blood- - I get it , you like me . Don 't be so , uh ... Don 't be so juvenile . Come on , I saw how you reacted when I got cut . I would 've done the same thing to anyone . Hmm . Well , how about this ? Now , that 's pretty grown-up , huh ? Wow . I don 't care what Cley says . This was a bad idea . Yes , we do seem to be learning by trial and error . Hmm . Mostly error . So no more prisoners in the office , right ? Oh , I certainly hope not , Rachel . You know , you , uh , saved all of us- - dropping Griffin and detecting Kern 's ability . Just trying to earn my paycheck . I scanned the entire office . There 's no sign of Griffin . She got away . And I 'm assuming that she took the data on Kern 's vitamins with her . She probably delivered it to her new employers , whoever they are . Hmm . Hmm . Things aren 't gonna get easier , are they ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

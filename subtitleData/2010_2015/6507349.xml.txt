 Previously on Caprica ... Some time off-world would be very healthy . I never expected this path to lead here . Look . The STO recruits . The ones that failed . Holy frak . I 'm not sure how much longer I can keep living this lie . Who 's the biggest problem right now ? Mar-Beth . She pretty much runs the place . Are you spying on Clarice ? I can 't let them catch me eavesdropping again . They will kill me . I need the jackets for any and all CIs you have in the field . She 's a good asset . She 's placed inside Clarice Willow 's house . Listen carefully . I 'm about to tell you something that 's going to upset you . If Clarice Willow is who I think she is , we could take down the entire STO . I will do whatever it takes to honor the soil and protect my family . Why do you follow this particular Guatrau ? He 's selling Cylons for profit to the STO , and he knows the difference one unit would make for the resistance on Tauron . I can help you . The Guatrau will never know . If we 're gonna go up against the Guatrau , we 're gonna have to do it together . V-World is a depraved cesspool of sin , and I 'm going to clean it up . - I can 't believe he found us . - How ? Zoe . Zoe ! Wait ! It 's this Avenging Angels thing . They must be talking about it in the real world . We 're gods in here . Let 's act like it and forsake these motherfrakkers . I will find my daughter again in V-World and take her home . Zoe 's alive . I want to see her . Well , let 's go find her . Our fortress is complete , Tamara . It 's paradise . Almost . Think it needs one more thing . How 's that ? It 's raw data . The digital architecture of New Cap City . How did you get it ? When I developed the Holoband tech , I included backdoor access to any virtual worlds created within it . My eyes are everywhere . There . Whenever she manipulates code to alter the fabric of the game , it leaves a trail . That was them . That was them . Okay , I 'm going in first . Uh , I don 't think that 's ... I slapped her the day before she died . She 'll remember that , right ? Well , she 'll remember whatever Original Zoe allowed her to remember . Probably . Yes . She said I 'd regret it for the rest of my life . I did worse . I , uh ... What ? I suspected she was hiding in the U-87 , so I tried to flush her out by exploiting her fear of fire . I know , I know . I wasn 't thinking clearly , and ... I 'm sorry . Zoe 's avatar knows how to hide , but with this program , I think ... Gotcha . Maybe this is going to be what we 've been ... Zoe ? Help ! Tamara ! Zoe ! Zoe ? Can you take her a message ? Let me go . I will . Please , just let me go . You 're in no danger , I promise . Please , I just need to speak to my daughter . Just let me go , please . Please , can you take me to her ? Hi , Dad . Oh . Thank the Gods . There 's only one . What ? What ? What ? Oh , Gods . Daniel ! Daniel ! What happened ? She 's still mad . She shut me out . She shut me out . If I want to get back in the game , I can only go in through an established portal . See , I 'm not really a gamer . New Cap City is a game with only one rule . If you die , you can never get back in , ever . One life . There are no hacks , no workarounds . Unless you 're Daniel Graystone . No , she just took that away . So , now I 'm stuck playing by the same rules as everyone else . I 'm sorry . They say our children have nothing to teach us . Sweetheart ... Well ... Now is not the time for a little ... What ? lesson . Sorry . But maybe , you know , this is meant to be , Daniel . Maybe we 're supposed to work for this . I think you 've been spending a little too much time with Clarice Willow . Maybe . I wish I had her certainty . Excuse me . Everything okay ? Yeah . What ? If we 're going to do this thing with Zoe , we 've got to get rid of the secrets , right ? I 've told you everything . Mmm-hmm . I haven 't . You told him ? He was right beside me when I got your text . I ... Look , I can only lie to so many people at once . Where have you been ? You disappeared . I was burned at the GDD . Okay , you 're scaring me . Amanda , the GDD has been compromised at the highest level . We 're on our own . Am I in danger ? No . One of the last things I did was to make sure you were protected . Tell me what 's going on at the Willow house . Mar-Beth abandoned her baby . What about the bug I gave you ? Did you catch her on the Holoband ? No . They got it locked up in the attic , I think . Something about Mar-Beth leaving spooked them . They 're being extra careful . This is the same model as Clarice 's , but I 've had it rigged . I need you to go back in there . No . Please . Amanda , I need you to go back in there . I need you to switch the Holoband . Bring me back the original . I 've got a guy that can hack it . Please . Something 's happening , and it 's happening soon . Honestly , it 's the last arrow we 've got . You be careful . Final analysis of the structural stress points is complete , and we have a fake repair crew going around the stadium . They 're planting supplemental charges . We have martyrs placed all throughout the stadium . We have a family of four right down there , for instance . No one would ever suspect them . Now , at the end of the countdown , they 'll set off the initial blast . That will then set off the supplemental charges , creating a chain reaction . And boom . The explosion will remote-activate the Zoe Graystone program . The scanned avatars of our martyrs will be uploaded to our V-World Heaven . The rest is up to the spin doctors . When do the press releases go out ? Thirty days , I think . Give people a chance to mourn and to bury their dead . It 's important , though , that the miracle conveys a sense of buoyancy , of joy . The servants of the one true God lifted to Paradise in a grand Apotheosis . I hope this is what God wants . What ? Of course it is . I mean , every time I go into that Holoband demonstration , it ... It just does not feel right . I mean , a lot of good people are going to die . Nothing good comes without sacrifice . They 're martyrs . It 's an honor . Is it ? Because they 're not actually going to Heaven , their scanned avatars are . And with the push of a button , I could transfer them all right now . The death of the original , it 's ... It 's just showmanship . It 's ... It 's totally irrelevant . It 's relevant to God . How can anyone truly know the mind of God , Clarice ? How do we really know you speak for him ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him yourself ? I 've squirreled away a few extra tickets to the big game . Are you ready to die for your faith ? Thought so . This is not a mortar . This is a mortar bomb . If you 're old enough to kill people , you 're old enough to know the right words to describe how you did it . Now , the mortar is extremely well-suited for short distances ... Soldier ! You failed to salute . I 'm late for class , man . That 's not the way it works . ... 500 to 1,700 meters , especially when you 're trying to get over an obstacle , like barricades or into trenches . What 's Lexon doing ? Now , once you 've learned to fire one of these mortars ... Frak you , man ! You don 't touch me ! On your knees ! ... we 're going to get to the real fun . He 's going to get himself killed . Don 't get involved . Eyes front ! We are all going to take our turn at muzzle loading . Robot , shoot this man ! We 're going to show you how to arm them and detonate them , without taking off too many fingers in the process . We will be firing a half-load charge at a target . I 'm sorry . I 'll salute you . Stop ! Soldier Rand ! Stop ! By your command . Rand ! Rand , get your ass back here ! Robot , resume ! Robot , resume ! Stop ! By your command . Robot ! Resume . Robot , resume ! Robot , resume ! Robot , resume ! Resume ! What do you have to say for yourself ? Permission to speak freely . Look , I 'm sorry I broke ranks . But your guard was about to kill Lexon . And I 'm glad he didn 't . Lexon 's a good soldier . But discipline must be maintained , above all . It 's what you 're here to learn . I don 't see how murdering Lexon over a stupid fight teaches anybody anything . I did say , " Speak freely . " What happened to inspiring people to fight for what 's right ? I 'll tell you what , Lacy Rand , when you 're in charge , you can run things your way . I 'll remember that . How did you get that robot to stop ? I don 't know . I just told it to . Are you aware that it is impossible for a U-87 to respond to anyone , except an authorized controller ? Maybe he has a sense of decency . Got a light ? Fidelia Fazekas ! What the frak ? Come here . Hey , you look like skor . I 've seen you look better . How did you get out ? Probation . Too many terrorists , nowhere to put them . Cap City Max is bouncing the small-timers to make room . Wow . My tax dollars at work ? Heard you got a bump from the old man . Yeah . It should have been yours . You 've been good for the Guatrau . I hear Yoseef got his ink , running this new Graystone operation . Mmm . It 's been healthy for him , you know , take his mind off things . Yeah . You heard about Shannon and Tamara , right ? I wish them a safe journey . Listen , Fiddy , I 'm sorry about how the score went down . You know , when you got convicted , a lot of us took it hard , especially Yoseef . That 's big of you to say . Hey , hey , hey ! Anyway , excited to be working alongside the famous Adama boys . You going to be around for a while ? A joke 's a lot funnier when it 's a joke , Fiddy . Now , you 've got to stop showing up here . The guys figure out I 'm protecting you , this deal is off . Tamara is alive in V-World . She 's with my daughter . What are you talking about ? Yoseef saw her die . No , she can 't die , at least not in the way that you and I think of it . They are holed up together deep inside the game . And to reach them , I need a fighter . I only have one shot at this , and it 's far too dangerous to ... What do you think , I 'm hired muscle or something ? Now , your company 's got private security detail . Why don 't you go waste their time ? No , I have to keep it quiet . The world already thinks of Zoe as a terrorist . She is a frakking terrorist . I 've heard all this from your brother . Do you want your niece back , or not ? Back how ? I 've been working on improved design models for a mechanical body for Zoe , artificial skin , and given enough time , I should be able to devise a believable ... No , no , you listen to me , you sick frak ! Tammy 's dead , returned to the soil , in reality , and in my brother 's heart ! That thing has nothing to do with it . No , it is her . It is not her ! It 's her . They are both real . It shouldn 't be true , but it is . Please , I ... I need to get my family back . Please . Good work . Now , go home and keep your head low . I want you to stay away from Clarice . Your husband , too . No matter what , you 've got to promise me that . What are you not telling me ? Mar-Beth is dead . In order to protect you , I fed false information . They thought they were killing a spy . You got an innocent woman killed . Hardly innocent . She just had a baby . Oh , please . That baby 's going to grow up and become a terrorist , just like the rest of her family . You 've done a great service for the people of Caprica . You 've done a great service for the people of Caprica . Oh , my Gods ! Oh , my Gods ! Oh , my Gods ! Dried noodles ? Yeah . Can you believe this ? What ? You don 't make your own noodles ? No ! What , you make your own noodles ? Do I make my own noodles ! Stand back , prepare to be amazed . Give me the flour . I 'm getting the flour . I 'm serious . Give me the flour . Okay ! Thank you . Hey , Ruth . Hey , Evelyn . Some eggs . Where did you get that shirt ? From school . I traded it . Avenging Angels . Pretty sick , eh ? Take it off . Why ? Take off the shirt . Why ? Take the Gods-damn shirt off ! No ! Hey , take off the frakking shirt right now ! Don 't you ever bring skor like this into the house , you understand me ? Not a word to your dad , either . Get out of here . Go ! Come on ! I 'll get rid of that . You can 't destroy all the shirts . These Avenging Angels are everywhere . Sarno makes jokes about them . Sooner or later , Joseph is going to notice . What do you want to do , Evelyn ? You want to give up ? No . I want you to take Graystone up on his offer . I want you to go into the game , find the Tamara avatar and kill it ! Graystone says it can 't die . Fine . Then you bury it . You weigh it down with virtual weights , put it into a virtual lake . Joseph needs to be rid of the dead things in his life . He needs to move on . Yeah , move on to you . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Ev . We 'll do this , okay ? I promise , we 'll keep him safe . Yeah . Sam told me you were back . No . No , no , no . Not picking up where we left off , I see ? It was a mistake . Really ? Come on , I was married . Not anymore , you 're not . Sorry . How did you get in here , anyway ? All access . Like a concert . Been here a while , actually . Really ? Mmm-hmm . Just looking into some stuff for the Guatrau . What , has he got you checking up on me ? Just getting me up to speed . I didn 't think it would be interesting , but it really is . I keep finding things I don 't understand , and then , like , two hours later , I 'm suddenly , " Oh ! " You know ? Yeah . Business is big . It 's , uh ... It 's very complicated . Like , right now , I 've got this puzzle . Looks to me like two in every two dozen or so robots isn 't making it to the military . We were skimming some for the STO on Gemenon , but not that many . Right , right , I noticed that , too . But I 'm told that the , um , robot skeleton requires levels of performance that are right at the edge of the specs that the suppliers can meet , so about one in 25 don 't pass our standards . Hmm . Okay . Okay . I didn 't notice any records of faulty skeletons being returned . No , we sell them to the , um , reclamation company , to be melted down . That explains it , mostly . Mostly ? See , this is what 's wrong with me . I see something like this , and I have to make the math work out , and you 're not getting paid for that amount of reclaimed metal . Well , there 's , um , non-metal components that get stripped off . Of course . Yes . Look , if you think there 's something going on ... I don 't . No , come on , say it . I mean , what 's going on here ? Don 't worry , counselor . Ninety percent of the time , it 's somebody putting a decimal point in the wrong place . Nobody 's going to get in trouble here , especially not you . The Guatrau trusts you , more than you know . You 'll be fine , I promise . You do look good . This is torture . Just hold your breath . Come on . Move . Just a little , move . Like this ? Oh , frak . Brain on fire . Thank you . Holoporn ? Yes , as a matter of fact . What business is it of yours ? It 's contraband . Are you looking to get yourself shot ? You 're just bossing everybody around today . First the robot , now me . Shut up , and get dressed . I need your eyes . Why ? Okay . I just need to go inside . Let me know if someone comes . Unbelievable . Robots , power up . You 're the one , aren 't you ? Raise your arm . Robot , lower your arm . Unbelievable . Zoe ? Are you in there ? We should go . If you 're in there , I need you to let me know . Lacy . Raise your arm if you 're Zoe . Zoe ? Please . Zoe , I ... I need you . Okay , we 're going now . Lacy , let 's go . Have a seat . So ... Who the frak is Zoe ? What , you don 't trust me ? Suit yourself . What is that ? Cottle . Zoe was my friend . She died . And ? And it 's hard to explain . This 'll help . I don 't need it . You can tell me when you 're ready . Hang on . Zoe Graystone was a true believer in God 's grace . An inspiration . She was my friend , and I loved her . Wait . Graystone ? That 's the Zoe we 're ... That 's kind of interesting . We can talk all about it , if you want . Later , maybe ? Good . Daniel , Samuel Adama is on the phone for you . Put him through . What can I do for you , Sam ? I 've had a change of heart about this New Cap City thing . I see . Can I ask why ? Yeah . I put a lot of my own cash into the war effort . Made a few bets that didn 't pan out , you know ? How much do you need ? Ten thousand . Eight . Seriously . All right , ten . But we go tonight . You 're the boss . I 'll get you the settings and times . Off . Probably should have asked for more . Does he suspect ? No . In Graystone 's world , people do just about anything for money . You live very rustically , don 't you ? Well , I suppose if you like it that way ... This girl , Lacy Rand , she was sent to us by Clarice Willow . Said girl exerts unexplained control over war machines we bought on the black market . This is troubling . Only if you try to explain it . I 'm sorry , Mother , I don 't understand . Secrets have answers . Now mysteries , they don 't have answers . That 's why I love them . They 're full of endless possibilities and permutations , like God himself . But if you solve a mystery , what are you left with ? A secret . Exactly . So ordinary . You know , our training is so harsh . I ... I worry about the children . All that fooling around with weapons and dangerous chemicals and explosives . It 's a wonder any of them make it through a program alive . Obal Ferras ' ring . You know what needs to be done . I 'll see to it . Is he going to be all right ? Yeah , he was stable when I left the ER . Luckily , Cottle was practitioner on duty . He will keep it quiet . I 'm so sorry , sweetheart . I 'm sorry . I 'm the one that got us into this mess . Well , you just did what you had to do . Serge , put the GDD on the line . No ! Cancel that . Why ? Duram said specifically not to . Gods , they 're probably the ones that shot him . Okay , do you ... Do you want me to try to hack the Holoband for you ? No . It was missing when I got back . She would have probably took it . Well , then what , sweetheart ? We just wait ? Hmm ? I 'll lose my mind . I want to see her . Well ? You 're right . All static . Can you fix it ? Sure . Just have to scrub the drive and reinstall ... Hold on a second . What ? I think this e-number is wrong . What , you know my e-number off the top of your head ? Photographic memory . Yeah , it 's a curse , really . I remember every syllable of every self-righteous speech you 've ever given . Yeah , I 'm right . These numbers don 't match up . But that 's not possible . Are you sure you wrote it down right ? Clarice , this isn 't your band . Amanda Graystone . She took it . No , she wouldn 't know how ... Frak ! She 's the one that 's been spying on us the whole time ! Look , there must be a perfectly rational explanation about ... You stupid , stupid woman . You just watch your mouth . Everything is on that band . Apotheosis , our timetables , information on our agents , on us . The GDD 's been playing us the whole time . We don 't know that . That means Mar-Beth ... Mar-Beth was innocent ? The mother of our child , and you cut her throat ? Frak ! Let me just think . Shut up . Let me think . All right , we have 24 hours until the explosion , and that is more than enough time to find Amanda , to find the band before they hack it , and to get Heaven back . And what do we do about Graystone ? I just want to talk to her . You ready ? Yeah . They 're here . I can feel it . Are you okay ? Oh , yeah . Let them come .

 No headaches ? Ah , any blurry vision ? I 'm fine . You sleeping okay ? TJ , I 'm good . I gotta go . Sir ... you lost someone under your command . Most recently , three people : Gorman , Spencer , and Rush . It happens . Well , I know how much it affects you . In different ways , I let them down . So , if you ever want to talk about it , I 'm here . I don 't . You should . I 'm sorry ? Like you said , you felt like you let Sgt. Spencer down . We all do . And there 's been a lot going on between you and Rush . What are you saying ? That emotionally , a lot has been left unresolved . Another time . Colonel ... off to , uh , file your latest report back to Earth ? That 's right . you intend to provide regarding the incident with ... Dr. Rush . Exactly what happened . I 'm ... scheduled to file my report with Earth later today , and it may cast some doubt on your version of events . There were only two people on that planet : me and Rush . I 'm talking about the obvious issues between the two of you . That doesn 't change anything . Listen , if you want to accuse me , you should have the guts to come right out and accuse me . I don 't have proof of anything . I think you just want to be in charge again . I 'm saying you had plenty of motive . Really ? Do you think that I want people on this ship suspecting me of murder ? Maybe that burden 's easier to bear than actually dealing with Rush . Well , I 'll admit it , I don 't miss the man . I say we 're all better off . Oh , well , that 's reassuring . So if you don 't measure up , you just get left for dead ? What-what exactly is the criteria then for sticking around ? Do you agree ? All right . Let 's do this . Let 's do it . All good ? All good . Hey , Eli . Hey , when you get a chance , can you check the shower system ? - The pressure 's been kind of low . Sure , once I 'm done here . Dr. Caine 's pretty cute , huh ? There is nothing sexier than a widower . A man who 's proven that he can make a commitment , and is single through no fault of his own . I mean , what more could you ask for ? I can hear you . Uh ... I-I ... I 'm so sorry . How about we just , uh , carry on like nothing happened ? Okay . Thank you . God . Kill me now . All right . I think we 're ready . Welcome aboard Destiny . I 'm Lt. Matthew Scott . You okay ? Ex-excuse me . Who are you ? Sergeant , what happened ? I have absolutely no idea , sir . What do you think ? Uh ... I 'm an IT tech . You know , I fix Earth computers , not Ancient communication devices . Malfunction in the connection ? That 's quite a hiccup . I 've seen worse . We don 't exactly know what these stones do , do we ? Well , no , not personally . I-I just got put on stone duty ' cause Riley 's not back on his feet yet . You know , sir , you have been under quite a bit of stress . Oh , you 're not suggesting that I imagined it ? No . Whoever took over your body was acting kinda strangely . Look , there was no way that I hallucinated that ship or that alien . My imagination isn 't that good . I was on a ship . And I saw an alien . Now , I want to know exactly what happened , what went wrong , and why And until then , the communications room and that device are off limits . Understood ? You got a minute ? Please , sit . You know , I always figured that limited resources meant that every day would be a struggle for survival , but I never thought it would come to this . Is that supposed to be some sort of hint ? Yeah , it 's a hint . If you 're wondering what to get me for Christmas , I need socks . I heard about today 's " incident " . Caine 's looking into it . You know , I find it interesting that the device just happens to malfunction moments after we had our conversation this morning . I guess it 's kind of coincidental . That 's one word . Another is " convenient " And another is " surprising " . Okay , your turn . You actually think that ... this will keep me from filing my report back to Earth . Actually , yeah . No , no , I 'm pretty sure it will . When the time comes , let 's hope that those who sit in judgment of you grant the mercy you denied Dr. Rush . I believe you mean " allegedly " denied Dr. Rush . Communications with Earth will resume as soon as I am completely satisfied that the next attempt to connect will not result in another coincidence , or a convenience , or a surprise . Thank you . We have tomatoes ! We finally have tomatoes ! More or less . Wow , that 's odd . So , I was talking to Dr. Inman , and she said the hydroponics team will have strawberries for us in about a month . Sort of strawberries . Talk to me when they can finally start growing meat . Well , actually , I hear they 're working on a soy-based protein . Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! Enjoy your tofurkey ! You 're in a bad mood . What 's the matter ? I haven 't slept much . Col. Young has me working around the clock trying to figure out everything that Rush was working on . You can 't be serious . Colonel Young was willing to sacrifice his own life so that one of us could have a shot at getting on the shuttle when the ship was heading towards that star . You think he 's a cold-blooded murderer ? I wasn 't saying that . I was ... It-it 's fine . Can you believe it ? Tomatoes ! What ? ... and from the second we got on this ship , they 've been the ones calling all the shots . What we eat , where we sleep , what we do and when And we just sit back and let them . Yeah , they 're the ones with the guns . Yeah , I mean , we have every right to be afraid . Look at what happened to the last person to challenge them . So ... what do you think we should do ? I don 't know ... Purple plants ? Are you kidding me ? Well , purple chlorophyll is sensitive to red and infrared light . Planet 's probably orbiting a red-dwarf . Well , the kino says breathable atmosphere Water and oxygen . I 'm concerned about potential stellar flare activity . Spot radiation . All right , then . We 'll suit up . Sirs ! You 've got to see this . It just showed up . Eli ? Bringing it up ... now . What is it doing ? Nothing . Yet . It 's just sitting there . Maybe we should try communicating with it ? How ? Uh , well , we have broadcast capability . Of course , there 's no way in hell they 'd understand us . Eli .. But I guess there 's only one way to find out . Two alien encounters in a day , what are the chances ? I 'm thinking likely ... zero . Okay , sending ... now . Let 's hope they speak Ancient . There is no way this is a coincidence . I bet you I was on that ship this morning . You figure you piqued their curiosity ? They came here to check on us ? I 'm thinking they 've been checking on us for a while . There is no other way to have found us so fast . They ... answered back . That 's not a translation . They answered in English . I mean , how the hell is that possible ? - I. .. - What did you say ? " Hello . W-we 're peaceful humans from planet Earth . We mean you no harm , and we 'd like to meet you . " What do I do ? Wh-what do I say back ? Nothing . Nothing ? Nothing . Get our weapons online . This is Colonel Young . All personnel , report to designated areas . Lieutenant , I need you and Greer in that shuttle . Yes , sir . Something 's happening . I-I think they 're launching smaller ships . Oh , my god . Uh ... only 30 % of the weapons are coming online . Rush put limits on how many could be activated at once . Right , right , after what happened to Riley . We were still in the process of checking each gun 's functionality . Well , find a way around it , Eli Disengaging . Eli , come on . Hey , hey , first real space battle over here ! You got it ? You got it ? Just about . Eli . Activate the forward battery . That 's what I 'm trying to do ! Come on , get back . Let 's go ! We 're taking heavy fire . Can you boost power to the shields ? I 'm workin ' on it . Shield power is being drained by the weapons . Come , move , go . Stay back . We 've got surges happening all over the ship . The weapons system wasn 't ready for this . Eli , everyone on board this ship is counting on you . I don 't need to hear that . You can do this . No . No , I can 't . Yes , you can . Why is this all on me , okay ? What about him ? I don 't care . Both of you . I need this ship working now ! You should 've thought of that before you got rid of Rush . Just fix it . You guys okay ? Yeah . Check her . Okay . They 're pulling back . Colonel Young , this is Airman Dunning . Please respond . They 're retreating . We got ' em on the run . Let 's give ' em something to remember us by . Lieutenant , I need you to end pursuit and fall back to Destiny . But , sir ... ! Do not engage . I repeat . Do not engage . Chloe may be on board one of those ships . What the hell happened ? Easy , Lieutenant . It was nobody 's fault . We were not ready for this . They gave up pretty quickly . Well , the attack may have been a distraction to try to come in close and take prisoners . Try to gain intel . Why are we the enemy ? I don 't know . Sir , that ship is still within shuttle range . Request permission to take — Permission denied . You wouldn 't stand a chance . With me . What are we going to do ? I 'm going after her . - How ? - The communication device . Sir , you are only assuming that 's the same ship that you were on ... Guess I 'll find out when I 'm on-board . Let 's elevate this . Have a seat over there , and I 'll get to you as soon as I can , okay ? Thanks so much . Anything I can do ? Take your pick . Grab some gauze . Don 't touch , don 't touch , don 't touch . - Chloe was taken . - What ? How ? One of the ships latched on , cut a hole . I can 't get a pulse over here ! Grab the bag ! Keep the pressure on him , please . Caine ... Yeah . Caine , we need you . It 's not bad . We are still working on it . Okay , that 's good . Tighter . Sir ... Sir ! Let me do it . Lieutenant , it 's not going to happen . For the record , I think this is a very bad idea . Yes , but is the best of bad ideas . Go . I think I got most of the weapons back online . How long is he going in for ? Twenty minutes . Then we pull him out . Okay . Colonel , you can always go back in if you don 't find her . Okay ? We are not your enemy . We mean you no harm . I don 't think it understands you . Th-they spoke English . They sent a one word message . For all we know , they have a translation device on their ship or something . Then they would 've sent it in Ancient . Why did you attack us ? Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? Why did you do that ? You want to help me ? This is how you read my mind . Do you understand ? This one transmits . This one receives . Like this . Here . Like this . Yeah . Colonel Young ! - What happened ? - He 's back . What just happened ? The alien ship is closing in on us . Send me back . Send me back now ! Okay . Good to go . Ready . It 's not working . Why isn 't it working ? Untie me . There doesn 't seem to be anything wrong with the device Did you find Chloe ? Uh , guys ? You may have noticed they 're attacking us again . Eli .. Our shields aren 't going to hold for much longer . Bring the main weapon online . Fire on the big ship . Chloe is still on board that ship ! Do it now , Eli ! Return fire . Everything we 've got . We can 't keep this up . The whole weapons system is overloading . Shields are down almost fifty percent I know . Where are you going ? To try and save Chloe . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . We have to go . Here . Oh , god . Where are we going ? This way . Report ! Bad and more bad . Too much power is going to the weapons . Our shields are going to fail . Bolster the shield . Devote all remaining weapons power to the main weapon . Keep firing on the big ship . Not like you , taking the shuttle without asking . He 'll say no , and I don 't want to disobey an order You gotta problem with that ? You want to save her , do it . I 'm going . You don 't have to . I 'm already here . They 're retreating . Keep firing ! We fire again , and we risk blowing ourselves up . I don 't have a choice . Do it . They 're ... they 're retreating . All of them except that one . Wait . They 're gone . Matt ! Colonel Young said you were dead . Oh , did he ? Did he say how it happened ? Rock slide . Well , obviously he was wrong again . Colonel Young , this is Greer . Come in . Go ahead . You are not going to believe this . I managed to , uh , activate the ... systems on the crashed ship . Found a database . I 'd only just begun to look through it when the aliens showed up . I guess I must 've accidentally activated some kind of distress beacon . Anyway , I 'm glad I did . I would 've died out there . Oh , well , there are a few people who thought Col. Young left you to die on purpose . I imagine there were No , no . He would 've rightly assumed that I was gone ... in the rock slide . So , what happened when the aliens brought you on their ship ? To be honest ? I don 't remember that much . The few times I was conscious they were ... Probing my mind . That 's something I 'd rather not think about , really . I know they were frustrated . I seemed to be able to resist giving them the information they wanted . He used their own neural interface against them , getting what he needed so we could escape . Location of their fighter bay . Basic operating systems . Anything else ? Like , why they wanted to destroy us ? I don 't think they did want to destroy us . What they really want is Destiny . Probably only care about us because we ... recently came aboard . No , what they want is a way past her defenses . Unfortunately , I didn 't have time to find out any more . My first priority was getting Chloe and I off the ship . Well , it 's good to have you back . Both of you . - So ... - So . I suppose you 're wondering why I didn 't tell everyone the truth . It 's your word against mine . I didn 't tell anyone you tried to frame me for Spencer 's death . Well , that 's true . No , I-I just wanted to know whether I can assume that you are going to try and kill me again next chance you get . I saved you from those aliens . You fired on the alien ship while I was still aboard . So was Chloe . That was a command decision , protecting the greater good . Yes , indeed . Look , I realize ... that I did provoke you . Well , if it means anything , I , uh , regret leaving you on that planet . Don 't get me wrong . I-I think you deserved it . But I regret that I lost control — that I became a man that I couldn 't respect anymore . well , you 're here , I 'm here . We just have to live with it , don 't we ? Well , so does everyone else on board . They don 't need the distraction . They don 't need to doubt their leadership . And this ship needs to be ready for the next encounter . If we haven 't found a way home by then . Of course . So , what ? We just pretend nothing happened ? Well , it 's not like we were ever friends . - For the sake of the crew . - For the sake of the crew . Hey there . Hi ! You mind ? No , it 's okay . You want to try some ? What is it ? It 's a little something that Dr. Inman 's been working on . She claims it tastes like gin . I say it 's a little closer to rubbing alcohol . Solid sales pitch . Um , no , thank you . All right . So , uh , what do you think ? You and James ? Any ... any chance there ? It-it could just get really awkward . You know , if things didn 't work out . I mean , being stuck on this ship with someone you 've had a bad relationship with ? No , thanks . It 's probably best to just keep things professional for as long as we can . I mean , we 'll see . If we 're here much longer , I hereby reserve the right to completely change my mind . The Colonel 's dangerous . We need to do something about that . I tried . I know . Damn near killed me for it . Next time will be different .

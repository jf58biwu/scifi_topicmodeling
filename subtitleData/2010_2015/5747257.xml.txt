Slattery : Make sure those snowmobiles go to starboard hangar " f " ! Chief spurling , chief lewis , we are getting under way at 1300 . Let 's pick up the pace , okay ? ! Yeah , I know all about the naval mountain warfare unit , But I 've never heard of a dog setting foot on a destroyer . This isn 't just a dog . This is admiral halsey . And he 's a mean operator . Yeah ? Well , so is the captain . Rachel : You can just put that down over there . Be careful . That 's delicate equipment . I take it you 're my new houseguest . I 'm commander chandler , ship 's captain . Rachel scott . I 'm sorry we had to take over your helicopter bay , But it was the only space large enough to accommodate our lab . I got 217 men and women on this ship . Anything I should be concerned about ? Oh , this ? Um , this is just so we don 't contaminate the work ... Not the other way around . What exactly are you gonna be studying up there ? Birds . Birds ? We are virologists ... Tracking obscure microbes in hard-to-get-to places . Pretty boring stuff , actually . We really do appreciate your assistance , captain chandler . We 're here to serve . Welcome aboard , doctor . Jeter : Roger that . Red deck . Bird 's chocked and chained , heading to the barn . Damn , it 's cold . I can 't feel my face . Lieutenant granderson , tell me ... Do I still have my face ? Yes , sir , though it looks like . You could use some lip balm , sir . Should 've taken that desk job in miami . It is cold ! Alisha : Captain 's on the bridge ! X.O. Slattery , Let 's see if we can get your frozen ass back to norfolk . T.A.O. , bridge . Bridge , t.A.O. Our helo just dropped a target for our final missile test . Target 's five feet long , two feet wide , And in the icy water has no heat signature . Let 's find it and kill it .

Missile clear . 2-2-0 , 30 . 30,000 . Boom . Siegle : Target confirmed kill . Good afternoon , nathan james . This is the captain . After four very challenging months at the top of the world , We have just passed our final test , And I 'm proud to say you did it with flying colors . I 'm asking the pentagon if we can break radio silence today . And make calls and e-mail . Bravo zulu to each and every one of you . Enjoy your success , 'cause we 're going home . Gonna drop to 50 below . Get them off the ice . Jeter : Aye , sir . Man : Dr. Scott , come in . Dr. Scott , are you there ? Please respond . Dr. Scott , come in . You have got to be kidding me . We 're so close . We need to make sure . The isolate isn 't contaminated . We need more samples . It 's all right , rachel . We can come back tomorrow . Ma 'am , we 've been trying to reach you . C.O. Wants you back on the ship . You can tell the captain that I 'll return when I 'm ready . It wasn 't an invitation , ma 'am . Right now . Captain 's orders . Man : Landing check is complete . Gear down and locked . 20 feet . 10 feet . Wheels down . We haul ass from here , we can make it back for the series . You don 't really think the cubs are still in it . It 's the weakest division in baseball . We were six games up when we left . Yeah , that was June . And they 're the cubs . Captain chandler , you had no right to pull me from my work . I 'm gonna go check on the , uh ... Yeah . Those men are here to support me . You don 't send them to bring me in . Those men are sailors in the u.S. Navy . And report directly to me . I say when I am done and ready . My work is vital here , and I have finally found . What I 'm looking for ! Doctor ! First of all , thanks for checking in . Think this is the first time you said more than three words . To me since we left norfolk . Well , I am sorry that I haven 't had you over for tea . You know , your attitude was mildly charming . Back in June in virginia , but up here , at 50 below , When none of us have talked to our families in four months , Not so charming . Yeah , well , charm wasn 't exactly my pri ... Still talking . Now , I think I 've been more than a gracious host ... Taxied you and your assistant around the islands here . So you could chase after your ducks . Arctic terns . You need to wrap it up . Our mission 's done , and we 'll be heading back . I 'll take a rain check on the tea . Benzo , eat some fruit . Oh ! Come on , mr . Chung . It 's our last night at the north pole . Look , I know you 've got big plans , But don 't you ever get your head out of that book ? Nope . Okay . Lieutenant . Lieutenant . Danny , whoa . Don 't do that . Do what ? You know what that smile does to me . All 's fair in love and war . Yeah . Kara ... We 'll be home soon enough . Rachel : Hello . Are you reading me ? Come in . No , I cannot wait . This is dr . Rachel scott . I need to speak to the national security adviser right away . You don 't understand . My mission is being compromised . And I need more time to collect samples . We have a noisy channel . I repeat . Mission objectives achieved . We are ready to come home . Over . Man : That 's a negative , commander . The mission has been extended . Over . Extended ? Why ? Maintain radio silence and current position . Until you receive further instructions . Mason : Transmission terminated , sir . The hell is that woman doing ? Rachel : Quincy ... I think we 've got it . Danny : Sorry , man . Did I wake you ? Doc told me to keep my distance . The admiral 's scaring off the birds . Sure it was the dog and not your breath ? Whatever . Man , we should 've been out of here days ago . What the ... Mason : Aircraft in position . Seven six decimal three five north , Zero five nine decimal five eight east ... Captain , I have three ... make that five unknown aircraft . Approaching , range 24 nautical miles , approximately 80 knots . Those are not ours , man . No . They 're russian . Come on ! Quincy , we have to save the samples ! Help me ! Leave the box ! Let 's go ! Rachel , leave the box ! Let 's go ! Right now ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Quincy ! Drop . Aah ! Set general quarters . General quarters , general quarters . All hands , man your battle stations . Transit up and forward starboard side , Down and aft portside . Unknown aircraft ... Man : T.A.O. , air . New air contact 80234 . At 015 at 36,000 yards . Inbound ... T.A.O. , surface manned and ready . Deploy scat . Ciws to a.A.W. Auto . Hold fire on . Aah ! Take him alive ! All engines ahead flank ! Hard left rudder ! All engines ahead flank , aye ! Mason : ... United states naval warship . Identify yourself and alter your course , Or you will be subject to defensive actions . Over . Evaluate as inbound missile . Recommend launch chaff . Brace for shock ! All hands , brace for shock . Take ' em out . Go to the 5 inch ! Surface , t.A.O. , kill track 5024 . Kara : Surface , aye . Guns , kill track 5024 . Man : Guns , aye . You okay ? ! Clear ! Come on . Chandler : Where 's dr . Scott ? ! She 's banged up pretty good . Doc 's looking at her in hangar two . What 'd he say ? " The cure . " He wants the cure . All our guys are accounted for . We at war with the russians ? Get me fleet forces . They don 't answer , get me nmcc . They don 't answer , get me secdef . Supposed to be radio silent . Not anymore . I told you I 'm fine . Just hurry up . Where 's quincy ? I need my samples . You don 't get your samples . Until you tell me what 's going on here . You have no authority over me ... everybody out ! You need to hand that case over to me right now . We may have just gone to war with russia , And they were clearly after you . No more secrets . Tell me about the cure ! I can 't say anything . Until I speak to the national security ... I swear to god , I will throw this overboard ! I want answers ! You want answers ? Seven months ago , outside cairo , there was an outbreak ... A virus of unknown origin . Its genetic structure . Was like nothing any of us had ever seen . It swept throughout the village , Killing everyone that it infected . Egyptian officials claimed the outbreak was contained , But it wasn 't . Instead , it continued to mutate and spread . The cdc and the w.H.O. Wanted to sample the virus . From the victims to create a vaccine . But nothing worked . It was my belief that we needed to find the primordial strain . Here in the arctic . The birds . They 're just the carriers . They pick up the virus from the melting permafrost . We finally found their feeding ground . So you have what you need to stop this thing ? I won 't know until we get it back to the lab . We 're running out of time . The virus back home is moving quicker . Than any of us could 've imagined . How would you know that ? We 've been radio silent since we left norfolk . Because I have my own sat phone . We were at emcon so no one would know our position ! We were at emcon to protect my mission ... Not yours . Orders came from the white house . Well , you led the russians right to us . And endangered my entire crew . It was imperative that I stay in contact . With the labs back home to keep them informed . Of my progress . I don 't think you understand what we 're talking about here . Enlighten me . When we left norfolk , The virus was at phase two , Limited to small clusters in asia and africa . We are now at phase six ... Global pandemic . 80 % of the world 's population is infected . The world is sick , captain chandler ... Very sick . Are you telling me the whole world is dying , And they send two people to save it ? It took weeks to convince the government to even send me here . Most of my colleagues think that I 'm insane . Are you ? I told you ... That what 's in that case ... Might be the only hope that we have . Captain , we have the president of the United States . On the vidcom . I 'm sorry you had to find out this way . Can I have my samples now ? Man : Stand by for the president . Morning , commander . Ma 'am ? I know . The last you heard , I was speaker of the house . The president died two months ago , The vice president a week later . What 's left of the federal government . Is holed up 200 feet below the white house , And communication is getting spotty . So we need to know now ... Does dr . Scott have what she needs to make a vaccine ? She thinks so , ma 'am . We are sending you the coordinates . To a secure bio-lab on the coast of north carolina . Ma 'am , we were just attacked by the russians . Russia no longer has a functioning government . From what we 're hearing , A breakaway force is operating on its own authority . We 're trying to ascertain all the facts . Ma 'am , our families ... how do we find out if ... I wish I could tell you , captain . Most of our population , al ... with our armed forces , Is dying or dead . We have no allies . We have no enemies . Just a world of sick , desperate people . Your ship was fortunate enough to be out of the hot zone . These past months . If dr . Scott has the makings of a cure , You have to come home ... Now . Man : Supply chains are completely broken . Food is in short supply . Hospitals ... Woman : ... Chinese government . Have detonated the bomb on its own people . To stop the spread of the deadly virus . Woman ♪ 2 : With possibly half the world 's population Dead or dying , rumors that the u.S. Is hoarding a vaccine . Continue to swirl . Man ♪ 2 : Urban services are completely overwhelmed . In most cities , entire power grids are down , Making communication next to impossible . Man ♪ 3 : People are asking , " where is the government ? " The virus has no treatment , no vaccine . So this whole weapons test ... it was all just a cover . And emcon alpha ... Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home . There 's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France . If we operate at trail shaft , we should just make it . How do we know they have enough fuel . To get us across the atlantic ? We don 't . What do we tell the crew ? Everything . We tell them everything . Captain ? Crew 's assembled . Ship 's company , attention ! I have news ... From home . Mason : Any station this net , This is nathan james transmitting in the blind . On fleetsat one , two , and three , over . Is anybody out there ? Due to widespread system failure , The number you are calling cannot be reached . This message will not be updated . Daddy ! Darien : I can 't believe I 'm gonna go that long . Without hearing your voice . Ashley : We miss you , daddy . Captain 's on the bridge ! Sir , we 're 50 miles off the coast of europe . And still no contact with french naval command . We 've got extra watch and guns at the ready . Were you able to reach home ? No , sir . I think only four people got through to anyone . And the news wasn 't good . Last time we made port in France , I promised my girlfriend . We 'd come back and see paris together . With everything , that 's all I keep thinking about . Well , that 's the stuff that matters . Jeter : X.O. ' s on the bridge . I got through to home . My boy 's gone . Oh , mike . Christine is up in deer park , some sort of safe zone for now . Girls are with her . Why don 't you take a break ? I-I got it . No , no . I 'm not gonna sit around my cabin staring at the walls . This is where I need to be . Sir , we have a fire order . It came across all channels , but it 's garbled . They cannot authenticate . Lieutenant ? Siegle : Confirmed fire order , sir , but the target 's unclear . Vampire , vampire , vampire ! Missile incoming high and fast . Spin four tomahawks . Hold for a target location . These coordinates don 't make any sense . Mason : No response from command . E.C.O. , aye . Break . Mml , align four echo missiles . And place them in the reload pool . Do we have a target I.D. ? Now five-one and trail . Woman : Missile fired from a surface ship in the north atlantic . Man : Ballistic missile traveling at 9,700 miles per hour . Confirmed . We have a nuclear burn in the air . We have no chance to intercept . Man : Batten down . Officer at the one , seal the ship . Prepare for nuclear detonation . This is no drill . Sir , the missile overshot us . Headed for land . Detonation in 12 seconds . Bridge , shield your eyes . God help us . Give me a status report on the switchboard and generators . Who 's that ? Chung , sir . Anyone hurt ? No , sir . What 's our engine status ? Sir , the , uh , electromagnetic pulse from the bomb . Blew our grid . Engines won 't spin . No propulsion . Emergency lights operating on battery power . Jeter : Captain ! That you , master chief ? Commo says the radios are down . No way to get messages in or out . We need to move this ship away from the blast zone . Lieutenant , let 's get those engines back online . Yes , sir . What temperature are we at ? 41 degrees , and we 've lost negative pressure . Damn it . We 're gonna lose everything . Okay , get the ice . Fuses in . Open valves three , four , and five . Shut valve to auxiliary engines and emergency air . Fuel lever on start . All right . Give it a kick start . Sir , we only have one more fuse . The jet stream 's pushing everything north-northeast . We got a cloud of radiation about to drop right on us . Give it to me . Sir , it won 't hold . It 'll hold . Captain , let somebody else do this . Rip it . Get your hand out of there . You heard me . Captain , don 't . I said rip it ! Badass , captain . Badass . Alisha : All engines ahead full . Left full rudder . Steady on new course 270 . What 's our fuel percentage ? 11 % , sir . Even at max conserve , we 'll run dry in six hours . Any contacts on surface search ? No , sir . 30-mile range . What is that in the radar shadow ? Change range scale . Looks like a ship . Calculate a course to intercept . Man : Markings indicate the ship is italian . Bridge to bridge operational ? I think so , sir . Vessel in vicinity 48 degrees north , 15 degrees west , This is u.S. Navy warship 151 on your starboard bow . Acknowledge and identify yourself . Over . Smith , rowler , benz , green , you 're on provisions . Master chief , you 'll assist chung with the unrep . We get as much food and fuel as we can and we get out . Let 's move . Rachel : Remember , if the ship has been impacted by the virus , It 's airborne and highly , highly contagious , Even from a recently deceased corpse . You must keep your helmets on at all times . You trained for this . You can do it . Chandler : Lieutenant , send naval warfare to the kitchen . Get as much food and supplies as you can . We got the stock rooms . Benzo and I will take the starboard side , Make our way to the galley . Master chief , get that fuel line across and pump it . Sending the pull line . Sending over the hose . Feed the line . Engineering , bridge . Engage fueling . System online ! Commence fueling ! Ship 's clear . No one alive , commander chandler . Over . Man : Aiutami . Aiutami . Dr. Scott ! Aiutami . Aiutami . He wants help . The only thing that can help him now is morphine . Let go . Let go . Oh , shit ! Frankie ! Put your mask on ! No ! It 's off ! Oh , shit . Frankie . Hey . Frankie ! It 's all right ! Look ! Get up ! Get away , man . Get away ! Master chief , we 're running dry here . Engineering , bridge . Disengage . Yes , sir . They 've got it , mr . Chung . Let 's get out of here . Yes , sir . Danny : You 're gonna be fine ! Frankie : Get away ! Just take the food and go get the hell out of here . No ! I 'm not leaving you , frankie ! I 'm a dead man . Just get out of here . No , man . I 'm not leaving you ! You tell him . He 's been exposed . We put him back in his suit . And we quarantine him on the ship ! You can 't risk it , sir . Mission comes first . I 'm not all too interested in dying like these people . Give me the gun , sailor . Frankie , don 't be stupid . I am giving you a direct order ! Put down that weapon ! Frankie , no ! Jeter : Lord god , by the power of your word , You stilled the chaos of the primeval seas , Made the raging waters of the flood subside , And calmed the storm on the sea of galilee . As we commit our brother franklin edward benz to the sea , Grant him peace and tranquility . Until that day when franklin and all those who believe in you . Will be raised to the glory of new life . Promised in the waters of baptism . Amen . Man : Left face ! Present arms ! Ready . Aim . Fire ! Fire ! Ready . Fire ! These people depend on me . I 'm in uncharted territory here . We all are . Not you . You saw this coming . I never thought it would spread so fast . But now I know why it did . I compared the blood that we took from the italian . To some samples I took before we left . The virus has an extra gene now , Which could have only been added with human intervention . So it was weaponized . Maybe . Or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow . But I think I know how to stop it . All the virus cares about is replicating . The engineered version lets it do that unchecked . So it no longer needs to mutate , Which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine . Then why hasn 't anybody done that yet ? Because they didn 't have the primordial sample . We do . Bridge , commo , get me the captain . Sir , we finally got the comms up . This came through . A message from potus . This is five days old . Yes , sir . It was transmitted while the radios were down . We need to confirm these orders . Get me the pentagon . Sir , I 've ... I 've been trying , but there 's no answer . I 'll try the lab . Get me the presidential bunker . North carolina 's not safe . President wants us to change course for mayport . There 's a lab in jacksonville that 's supposed to be secure . There 's no answer there or the pentagon . Sir , nothing from the bunker . Maybe our signal 's not getting out . We check the transmit side ? That 's not the problem . Their phones are ringing . Sir , I have another message coming through ! It was transmitted at the same time as potus ' . It looks like a much bigger file . It 's an mpeg , sir . Play it . Tom . We 're at your father 's cabin . He thinks he has a way to get this message out . Through his contacts at the pentagon . I have no idea when you might be seeing this . Or where you are . We 're all healthy . We managed to get out early . And have been up here for a couple months already . We haven 't heard anything from your brother or sister . For a while . My , um ... My sister didn 't make it . But , honey , we 're fine . We really are . And I really hope that you are , too . Kids ! Come on out here . It 's a tape for dad . Come on . Come . Come say hi . Daddy , where are you ? We miss you . Sam : We love you , daddy . Just get here if you can . We love you so much . Okay . All right . Let 's turn it off . Hey . I don 't know what we 're going home to . No radiation detected within a 100-mile radius , sir . If america was nuked , it wasn 't here . We 're home . You said you have what it takes to make the vaccine . If you had to , could you do it here on the ship ? The lab wasn 't built for that . It 's for collecting data . But if you had to , could you ? The expeditionary team will forward deploy . And secure the area for the next group . Hopefully we 'll find support . Got to be prepared for anything . Everyone carries their own biohazard suit . We do not engage unless we are engaged . Prepare your people and await further orders . Dismissed . There 's still no answer from potus . And nothing from mayport or the lab . We can 't even get an f.M. Radio signal . If the power grid 's down , that means everything 's down . We 'll know more when we get boots on the ground . Mike , we 're not going home . What are you talking about ? The lab 's 200 miles inland . You saw the news footage . We 'll fight our way in there if we have to . And then what ? Generators run out in a couple weeks , Maybe the civilian population tries to overrun it . There 's too many variables . So , what do we do ? We stay on the ship ? Dr. Scott says she has what she needs right here . Dr. Scott . We have standing orders . From the president of the United States . From five days ago . In the absence of a command structure , I decide what 's in the best interest of our mission . And we have enough food here to last us what , a week ? How much fuel ? We 'll find what we need . We 'll die out there . No . We will not . Tom , I appreciate what you 're trying to do . But it 's not gonna work . People want to get home . And who exactly gets to go home . When we have 80 biohazard suits for 216 people ? We draw lots . I can 't think like that , mike . It 'll at least give people a chance . To get back to their families , to say goodbye . I 'm not letting anybody on this ship give up . That 's not your call . You don 't get to play god . I 'm still the captain of this ship . Now , I 've laid out our mission . I expect you to fall in line . Rios : Captain 's on the bridge . Left full rudder . All engines ahead flank . Sir ? Left full rudder . All engines ahead flank . Aye , aye . Left full rudder . All engines ahead flank . Left full rudder . All engines ahead flank , aye . This is the captain speaking . We have no contact with home , And I have good reason to believe . That the american government is no longer functioning . The country we all hoped we were coming back to no longer exists . We left these shores four months ago . As members of the United States navy . But now we are more than that . Now our duty is to the entire world . On board this ship is the hope ... For our futures , for our families , And for all of humanity , Because in that lab in our helo bay . Are the ingredients for a cure . And this is the safest place on earth . For our scientists to do their work ... On a $ 3 billion piece of machinery . Protected by 216 sailors in the u.S. Navy . Our mission now is simple . We do whatever it takes to stay alive at sea . Until they find that cure . There 's an unmanned food and fuel station . Outside guantanamo bay . For the moment , that is our destination . We 've lost so much already . But this is the most courageous and resilient crew . With whom I have ever been privileged to serve . We will come through this together , And we will prevail . Carry on . Attention on deck . Lieutenant granderson , Permission to salute the captain . Permission granted . Hand salute !

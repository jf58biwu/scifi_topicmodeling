 We call them Advanced Cultivars . Jack 's talking all kinds of rubbish about you ordering their execution . It 's true . I ordered Mitchell to take the ACs out and kill them . You were not authorised to open fire . I know you , Julius . You wouldn 't help a drowning man unless there was something in it for you . We both know things need to change and I would like you to be a part of that . You 're forbidding me from searching for my daughter ? Let the rescue party do its job . Our children were dying from C23 . We faced extinction . I lost both my boys . There 's still a lot about this place you don 't know . How long has that been there ? We 're talking tens of thousands of years . Are you saying humans have been here before ? I don 't know , but this changes everything . THUNDER The knight moves two in one direction , one in the other , like an L. The only piece that can jump the others . KNOCK ON DOOR Come in . Come on . Well ... ? The jawbone definitely belonged to some kind of primate . I hate to rain on your parade , Mrs Down , but there were fossil specimens from Earth on the last transporter . Well , if it is from here , if it is hominid , then it makes every other scientific discovery known to man seem pretty small . Listen , Stella ... What is it , Richard ? You can tell me . I 'm only going to tell you what I know to be true . I won 't give you explanations or rationales , because I don 't have any . The one thing I will say is that I don 't believe in ghosts and I know I 'm not going insane . You going to tell me what it is ? My children are here . Richard ... Here , Stella . It 's not a hallucination . I felt their presence at first , then ... They 're here with me . If anyone else had told me that ... Exactly . It 's me . And I 'm not going crazy . THUNDER ROCK MUSIC Does your mum know you 're here ? Yeah . Does yours ? You just doing it to annoy her ? Cos that 's your job , right ? My job 's rescuing damsels in distress , remember ? It 's your round . Beer for me and ... orange squash for the ladies ! Any of them give you trouble , you let me know . I 'll break some jaws ! Your mum know you 're here ? You got whisky ? Of course . Scotch or Irish ? Scotch . Don 't know if you 're new off the transporter , but whisky , like most things connected to instant gratification , is not seen as a resource priority . " Resource priority " ! What kind of talk is that ? President Tate 's . Who ? Tate . Never heard of him . Where 're you from ? You ever been up the coast , son ? It 's in the closed zone . Radioactive . Don 't believe everything they tell you . Man needs the ocean . It 's my home . Yeah ... I like to think of the highway as my home . Roll down the window , let the wind blow my hair ... Ugh ! You got bigger glasses ? I 'll need five more . Where 's your card ? Card ? Got a live one here ! I could still kick your arse . OTHERS : Whoa ! I need to see some kind of ID . My name is Pak . And I shall pay old-style . Come on , pretty . Take the lot . And get me a decent whisky . That makes your eyes sparkle . Give the gimmer a drink . Oi ! Ah , perimeter rules . Just there to be broken when you 're 14 . When I was 14 I was a volunteer in the Construction Brigade . Yeah , you 're a freak , though . Talking normal 14 . It was brilliant , everybody working together , and at night we used to sit out around the fire and people got guitars out . Yeah ? You sing Kumbaya ? Don 't take the piss . I was building for the future . BEEPING 'Unit to car 91 . ' Kicking off in the bar . What 's the betting the XPs are involved ? Never even seen this planet ! Cowering down here in this hole . Come on ! Come and see for yourselves . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! My money 's on the old boy ! We all know PAS officers can 't run ! Mine . OK , mister , you need to show us some ID and come with us . What is it ? Diamonds . What 's this joker doing throwing diamonds around like peanuts ? Come on . Come and see ! Come and see your planet ! He had dozens of them . Well , maybe he knocked over a Tiffany 's before he jumped the transporter . No , he found them right here , on Carpathia . Is that possible ? Well , we 've no knowledge of any diamond deposits so it 's unlikely . But I 'd rather be out looking for sparklers than a bunch of old bones . You miss out in the beginning , you end up working the mine , not owning it . Keep this strictly between us for now . No need telling Stella Isen . Remember - knowledge is power . Yeah , well , I think knowledge is overrated , actually . This is power . Not yet . CASS : Fun 's over . PAK : Just beginning . FLEUR : OK , name ? Wee Willie Winkie . Try again . Used to call me Pak . Gotta come with us now , Pak . Bit of explaining to do with regards to those diamonds , your lack of ID , and generally being a pain in the arse . You come with me . Why should we do that ? I 'll show you where the diamonds are . Or we take you in , chuck you in the drunk tank and make you show us . Stop right now ! 'They never checked their guns in and we don 't know where they are . ' What do you mean , you don 't know ? Has anyone seen Cass and Fleur this morning ? Whoa ! Whoa ! Where 's the fire ? Two of my officers have gone missing . Missing ? Failed to report for duty . Last seen chasing a drunk from a bar . Ah , Mr Diamonds . Jack was all a-glitter about him . Yeah , I 'm going to the bar . Say hello to your daughter . There was a fight in here last night . That 's right . Two of my officers were present . The man who started the fight had no ID . He said his name was Pak . Didn 't start it , really . It just started . Did he talk to anyone ? XPs , mainly . And him a bit . The guy from last night ? Yeah , he was a blast . Claimed he was from the ocean . The ocean ? Said it was his home . Maybe he 's an AC . He was far too old to be an AC . Is that it , then ? Interrogation over ? Two people are missing , Lily . Is there anything else you remember ? He was pretty good with his fists . I 'd say he 'd seen a few bar fights in his day . No bar cards or anything . Oh , and he had a tattoo . What kind of tattoo ? 'The insignia of the first XPs and the date of the first human landing . ' Then there 's the name . Pak . Short for Patrick . Maybe it 's the Patrick who first landed on Carpathia . The Patrick Baxter who went crazy and murdered his commanding officer . Except that , after that , he took off in a craft he knew Carpathia 's energy fields would quickly bring down . Maybe he survived . There were reports of a fireball . Well , nobody ever did a proper search . It was a fireball . Well , he could have survived , got out somehow . For 11 years , alone ? Well , now we know he wasn 't necessarily alone , don 't we ? Why 's he come back here ? I don 't know . He 's got Cass and Fleur . He mentioned the ocean . I 'm going to go and see . Stella . You stopped me before . Not this time . The ocean is a closed zone . It 's also the place where all life starts . I need to see for myself . Mmm ! Mmm . Eugh ! So this won 't be embarrassing ( ! ) He got us lost . No way we was going to make it back in the dark . Did the right thing staying put . And I 'm sure everyone will see it like that . Jack 's way too sensitive to take the piss out of us for it ( ! ) We 're still a bit lost . Feels much better in the daytime , though . Did you sleep well , officers ? The ground was not too hard for you ? I could hear you grumbling for ages . Still , if it helps you did the sensible thing . Why did you lead us here ? Well , we needed daylight for where we 're going . Take us back to Forthaven now . I can show you more than diamonds . Come on . I can show your arse the end of my foot . Bodies . What bodies ? Come and see . Not far from here . We should go back , find out who he is . Let 's just see what these bodies are . He 's leading us on a wild-goose chase ! You don 't think we 're a match for him ? Come on ! Where 's your spirit of adventure ? STELLA : Jack . Where do you think you 're going ? We have a problem . Well , two , actually . " We " ? You know that man who was throwing diamonds around ? Yeah , I 'm looking forward to round two with the Ice Man . While he was distracting you with precious stones , you didn 't happen to work out his identity ? Who is he ? I think it might be Patrick Baxter from the advanced landing party . Where is he ? Outside the perimeter . We need to track him down . " We " ? You got no expeditionary skills . Jack , please , I need your help . Why do you wanna come so bad ? He 's got Cass and Fleur . If they 're with him , then they 're in big trouble . Let 's go . FLEUR : Right , I 've had enough of this . He said close by . You , Rip Van Winkle , stop or I 'll shoot both your legs off . Be nice to me . I 'm your way home , remember ? Never been here before . We 're heading to the closed zone , aren 't we ? We 're not going into it . You ! I 'm detaining you for three code violations . Scared ? If it 's full of radiation , yes , I 'm fond of my hair and skin . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Beats his , that 's for sure . Don 't listen to the XPs . They know nothing . How did I survive so long here ? It would help maybe if you told us a few simple things , like who you are , what you do and ... GUN CATCH Oh , dear ! Looks like we 've got a situation . Greed , materialism , the root of all evil . When humans lose their reverence for mystery , it 's quickly replaced by pointless lust for base metals and trinkets . Please stop coveting these meaningless items . You can turn your attention to the Universal Spirit who brought us all here in the first place . APPLAUSE I see your congregation is growing . Many have tried to suppress faith , Richard . All have failed . Some friends on the Council feel I should now be given a portfolio . Let me guess . You don 't want it for yourself , but the pressure will force you to accept . Public welfare . That portfolio doesn 't exist . Exactly . Sounds to me like a catch-all phrase to allow you to stick your nose in wherever you want . Only when it concerns the public welfare . You really should stop scowling , Richard . You 'll age prematurely . Oh ... you really should try working on your inner harmony . SIGHS Let 's hope your boyfriend 's around to help us if this goes wrong . Rudi 's not my boyfriend . Don 't tell them that . Say you 're ready to make like his squaw . Might be our last bargaining chip . This is helping , is it ? With the fear . So we can pass , if I carry the guns . It 's OK , we don 't want to pass . Let 's go back . No , no . That option is not on the menu , not any longer . Did you set this up ? I 've stayed with them . They 're OK . They trust me . I 'm your safe passage . You get the weapons back when we 're out of sight . You can trust me most of the time . No ! What did you do that for ? Where you 're going , you won 't need guns . Where 's your spirit of adventure right now ? STELLA : He 's heading towards the coast . JACK : It 's toxic out there . Well , maybe he knows something we don 't . Those early surveys were hardly exhaustive . Why 's Baxter come back ? No idea . What 's he want ? No idea . Where 's he going with Cass and Fleur ? I refer you to answer one . I see why they gave you the job of top cop . Look , I ... I just can 't understand why you 'd kill your friend and CO . I know every now and again I get the urge to strangle Riley here . He 's pig-ugly , not exactly the full ticket , but then I remember he 's a really good tracker . Probably got a mum out there that loves him . Baxter was the first man down here . Yeah , that 's what turned him into a psycho . Suppose it would be stupid to ask you to take us back . Two of you . An old and crazy man . You 're free to go now , if you want . You know we 're not . I can see you thinking ... tick-tock ! What are you thinking ? Where are you taking us ? What are those bodies you spoke about ? How this is all going to end . Are you worried ? I don 't have a gun . I could have kept one . Yeah . That 's what I 'm worried about . You must want us to come with you pretty badly , then . I listen to my body . I know what it is telling me . This is my last journey . I am taking you to Paradise . You can be Adam and Eve . BEEPING What 's the reading ? Good . It 's OK , actually . Seems like he 's plotting a path through the radiation hot spots . You been here before ? Nope . You been to the sea ? I refer you to answer one . Mitchell said the whole coast was a radiation danger . STELLA : Mitchell often lied to us . You dealt with him wrong . You and Tate . Did we ? You look down on people too much . It makes enemies . Well , if not allowing you to behave like a bunch of deranged cowboys ... GUNSHOT Down ! You see those rocks ? We 're gonna run over there . Keep going in a zigzag . They 'll be aiming for me , so if they get you , it 'll just be good luck . Good luck ? For them , obviously . Run ! GUNFIRE You any good with one of these ? Just point it at the nearest mutant and pull the trigger . Like that ? We scared ' em off . What shall we do now ? We either wait till I think they 've gone or we wait till it gets dark . What 's up ? It 's normally mobbed at this time . Everyone 's outside the gates looking for diamonds . People keep hassling , cos they know I 've got one . It 's going crazy . Water 's all funny , cos half the maintenance teams have downed tools and headed for the hills . Of all the things that might have turned up , it 's gotta be something that only ever caused trouble . XP patrols are to prevent anybody outside the perimeter from going further than the scrubland . PAS officers are to crack down hard on anybody using any alternative currency to the normal distribution system . We need food and light and heat . We do not need worthless stones . PAK : Sometimes I imagine I can see Earth . FLEUR : We can see the sun . Do you know where ? 23 degrees east of north . I used to know where to find it . Nope . Can 't remember now . Which way is it ? Over there . You were a flight pioneer . Part of the advanced landing party . Was . The first man to land on Carpathia was called Patrick Baxter . It 's you . You know nothing . So tell us , then . The first creature from Earth to set foot on Carpathia was an AC by the name of Tigger 99 . He was bred specifically for the purpose . All the data said that it was hospitable down here . But somebody had to actually put down their foot . Tigger 99 went in first . They 'd bred the fear out of him . He had no regrets no fears . He danced down here for us . We gave him 20 minutes , then I followed him in . Three hours later he was dead . They 'd failed to update his immune system . SNIFFS He was Carpathia 's first foot . Caught a cold and died in a single day . Then what happened ? And they left me alone . And I watched him die . And I spent the next 24 hours with his corpse . And I realised that the planet didn 't want us . Is it true that you went crazy and killed your CO ? PAK LAUGHS Took off on your plane ? Even though you knew flight was impossible here ? Best if you shut up now . They say you beat him to death . You were best man at his wedding . I 'm sorry . Lucky he had no family . He was a good tracker , though . Are you ? Not as good as Riley . Good enough . D 'you think they 've gone ? Yeah , but not far . If we don 't hit ' em hard , we 're gonna have a guerrilla army on our backs . Well , that 's the thing with guerrilla wars . You hit them , they hit you back , it just goes on and on . Not if you take out their leader . Why are you here ? The coast . What ? If this ends up at the coast , I want to be there . What 's at the coast other than radioactive sea ? The sea is the place that will tell me where life started on Carpathia . Stella , you think too much . You need to think less . That will make life much easier . CASS : Mm ? FLEUR : We should go , Cass . I don 't trust him at all . I don 't know . No weapons , completely lost , surrounded by ACs in the middle of a radioactive zone . He 's a killer . He beat his commanding officer to death for no reason . He hasn 't told us the reason . What if he won 't take us back to Forthaven after he 's shown us these bodies ? We have to stay friendly . Build a relationship . He 's crazy . He could flip out any minute . That 's how it makes me almost sorry for him . All these stories but nobody to talk to . It scares me . The way he talks about the planet not wanting us . This is our home . He has brought us safely through the closed zone . Do you know what lies at the end of it ? I know . I 've sometimes thought that I can hear it . Waves crashing on the beach . I 'd love to see the sea again . D 'you agree , though ? We stay ? I guess we have no choice . Richard , you 've ordered a lockdown ? At this rate our essential services will grind to a halt . And it 's not safe out there . I 've even seen people taking their kids . Oh , I agree . More than happy to speak to the people directly and back your decision . Last time I let you speak , you used it to launch a public prayer session . Well , this time you wouldn 't be letting me , exactly . I am a full Council member . I 'll be sitting with my finger on the button . I hear the words " universal " or " spirit " , I 'll cut you off straightaway . What ? You want me to promise ? Come on , Richard . This is one type of materialism whose corrupting influence we can both agree upon . This is it , isn 't it ? Where you came down . Is this your ejector seat ? I thought that I saw the sea . The navigation systems went haywire and right off the dial . Threw me into a tailspin . Bang ! Hit eject . I got thrown clear . I was still alive . Couldn 't move . Both my legs were shattered . How d 'you survive ? I got free of this seat and just lay there . Nobody was coming for me . This planet doesn 't want us . But here we are ... building for the future . I 'll show you your future before I die , and then I 'll tell you the way home . Don 't want to die alone , do you ? For all your pride about living alone out here you want human beings around you when you go . I can hear the ocean . I 'm nearly home . President Tate has ordered the lockdown enclosure of the perimeter fence . I know this may seem draconian and even authoritarian , but his measure was fully supported by General Council . They named you poorly , Julius . Much more of the Mark Antony about you . We have allowed greed and avarice to return , distracting us from the beautiful task we 're undertaking . I urge us all to re-evaluate , to look inside ourselves . SCREAMS Light does not lie in precious stones . It resides in each and every one of us . The gleam and the glimmer of our human souls . They knew I had a diamond from the bar . Thieving savages . This is Berger 's fault . How ? He 's been denouncing the whole diamond craze . And keeping people aware of it at the same time . Two-faced and dangerous . You 're exaggerating . Wake up ! He 's slithering towards power . He 'll try and get rid of Tate and your mum . Then things here will be very different . After I crashed I could not move . Could not find shade or water . I lay down and waited to die . What happened ? My dog found me . Your dog ? Golden retriever . It brought me wood to splint my legs , herbs to eat , water in my canteen , told me not to give up . You had a fever ! You were hallucinating . She was a dog . Her name was Molly . She left me a couple of years ago . Well , cheer up ! At least imaginary friends can 't die . Everything can die . Everything that exists can die , but there are no dogs on Carpathia . Your way of thinking is wrong . Your way of seeing . You 'll never understand this place thinking like you do . Home . MELANCHOLY MUSIC SPEECH INAUDIBLE MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES BEEPING BEEPING HIGHER AND FASTER No , can 't go this way . Rad 's going crazy . It 's right off the dial . Well , that way , then . I guess so , but it 's not the way to the sea . But there 's no other way through , though , is there ? Maybe it doubles back through the peaks , I don 't know . These bloody flies ! They 're like horseflies , attracted to blonde hair , we 've found . Great ! Ow ! I told you ! Blonde hair and big brains . You were asking for it , mate . FLIES BUZZING Ugh ! It got me as well . Must have been a PAS sympathiser . Agh ! Jack ... Jack ! Jack ! Where 's your knife ? Where did it get you ? Let 's have a look . OK , stay still . God ! Breathe . Adrenalin . Move ! OK , just breathe . Breathe . OK ? CHUCKLES That 's never happened before . No . Insect bites can be like that . It 's crazy . Don 't worry , I won 't tell anyone . Thank you . PAK : Stay here . Don 't go back . We 've got lives back there . Good lives . Memories , too . So where are these bodies ? Come with me . How did you know where the radiation danger was ? What 's your name ? Cass . The planet told me , Cass . Where 's he going now ? Does he want us to swim after him ? MELANCHOLY MUSIC SPEECH INAUDIBLE MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES SPEECH INAUDIBLE MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES SPEECH INAUDIBLE I do appreciate that . If you 'll excuse me one second . The perimeter lockdown appears to be working . Good . I was just speaking to the Head of Education . Yeah , I saw that . She seems amenable to my suggested changes to the syllabus . At the moment it 's somewhat dogmatic and non-embracing of competing theories . This issue of your portfolio . Yes , public welfare . I 'll veto it . That 's disappointing . I thought I 'd tell you personally . Appreciate that . Do you realise a two-thirds majority on the Council will overturn your veto ? And I have no doubt you 'll cultivate your contacts in order to achieve that . I 'd rather not make your position as President untenable . That shtick won 't work with me , I 'm afraid , Julius . You 've had removing me from office your objective since day one of your arrival . I won 't make it easy for you . Never thought you would . What are we gonna do now ? Let the sea take him . We don 't know where we are . The sea 's rising . He said it would take the beach back . What are we gonna do , Cass ? Head out , I guess . We 'll get lost . Well , we can 't stay on a disappearing beach , can we ? Not so magical now , is it ? Come on . BEEPING Where are they ? Are we safe here ? Reading 's dropped to practically zero . Bingo ! What 's that ? It 's a time machine . Where are they ? What 's he done with them ? This isn 't the way . We didn 't come this way . I don 't understand , cos it wasn 't the other way , either . SHE SCREAMS Wh ... What is it ? I didn 't see . I didn 't see . Some sort of snake . Oh ! There 's no snakes here . Really ? Well , maybe it was a golden bloody retriever , then ( ! ) We should go back to the beach . Good idea . We 'll wait till dark , then use the stars for navigation . Can you ? Don 't be stupid , course I can 't . At the beach we can try and work out what to do without getting more lost . BANG What was that ? It came from the ocean . That , my girl , is a standard issue orange parachute flare , as commonly used by our beloved colleagues from the expeditionary base . Shall we ? Right . Nice . Stella ! Fleur ! Are we glad to see you ! Must have been a hard journey . Not really . You know the way back ? Course I know the way back . I 'm an expeditionary . Where 's Baxter ? Guess his heart gave out . Why did he bring you all the way out here ? Knew he was dying . Didn 't want to be alone at the end . Said he was going to show us our future . The bodies he mentioned , did he say where they were ? He was going to show us . Time ran out on him . You give me a few moments . I need to look around . Sea 's coming in , Stella . She 'd better hurry up . I wanna get home . CASS : Stella ! Stella ! We gotta go . The beach is disappearing . Hurry ! What are they ? It 's a family . Father , mother , child . Fossilised . The bodies . Cass ! Cass ! Wasn 't a fantasy . Come on ! Come on ! Look , come on . We 've got to go . We 're gonna get cut off . Look , it 's coming in fast back there . Do you wanna take them ? Maybe we should . No . They 're a family . We 'll leave them . Come on ! So , how old , do you reckon ? I don 't know . But ... were they humans or were they ... ? I refer you to answer one . Here 's the thing , though . You 've found fossils of ... whatever . Homo , octopus , whatever you want to call it . What we 've seen here alive isn 't more advanced than the fly that bit me . Yup . I 'm no scientist , but ... Really ? ... but wouldn 't you expect there to be more-complicated species running around ? Not trees , flies and a few birds . I mean , where have they all gone ? Patrick Baxter said we didn 't understand Carpathia yet . We didn 't know how to look properly . RUSTLING What 's that ? ACs . Nothing . Maybe that snake you saw ( ! ) It could have been a snake . You know we have to deal with the ACs . I 'm not gonna let them get away with what they did to Riley . Morning , everybody . This is Radio Free Carpathia here to remind you that diamonds are not forever , actually . Now , I 'm no fan of rules and regulations , but I 'm glad they locked the gates for a while . Only place for a diamond is in the needle that makes the vinyl sing . That was crazy . Like a dream . But it 's real . I can still smell the salt on my skin . Yeah . Seas are like that . You 're back . I 'm pleased . How uncharacteristically effusive of you . Still think I 'm crazy ? I never said that . Maybe we need to redefine our understanding of supernatural . Perhaps what 's natural on Carpathia might be different than what was natural on Earth . OK . Well , we have your hallucinations . Stella ... Visions , then . Whatever you want to call them . We 're also finding the remains of some kind of protohuman life form . Now thought to be extinct . Richard , let 's just focus on the real , that for which we have physical evidence . You don 't count my testimony as evidence ? I can 't find any evidence that isn 't based in the supernatural , and I don 't believe in the supernatural . Nor do I. Opening data package 5 . This is Alchemist to CT10 . Richard Tate has violated his mission and has no ambition beyond some vague Utopian ideals .

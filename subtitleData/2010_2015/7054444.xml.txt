 During the early 21st century a virus destroys nearly all life on earth . It is called the VXII . A 50 foot containment wall was built to protect the non infected survivors ; it stretches over 200 miles and surrounds the last four cities . There is no life beyond the wall . Internment camps are built to accomodate the increasing number of orphans . Only five children survived the brutal conditions : Sentenza , Kane , Vitor , Shawn and Jude . They are known as the Drifters . Most of them have disappeared and vanished from the public eye , except for one . Jude Black now leads a terrorist gang of disillusioned youths called the Vespers . They have taken control of three cities within the wall and are now trained on the last standing city : Hawthorne It 's how we 're brothers , see . You know , brothers ! Hey ! I have a joke . There 's two brothers , both evil , both friends . Hey Jude ? You listening ! Huh ? Jude . - How much are they paying you ? - Could you just listen ? ! So one day the older brother dies . And the younger brother bribes the pastor and says , 'I have only one condition : at my brother 's funeral , you have to call him a saint . ' And the pastor ... Troufeau put you up to this . God , Jude , would you listen ? ! It 's about brothers . You know . That 's all Sentenza . Two brothers , one 's dead the younger brother bribes the pastor ... What are you afraid of ? We 've always been close . Brothers ? My brother would have never have come here today . Two brothers , one 's dead , the yonger brother bribes the pastor . The pastor gives his word , pockets the money ... but at the funeral , like , he says , this man was evil . He cheated on his wife , he beat-up his kids . But compared to his brother , he was a saint . Hawthorne City The first time I saw the white wall was the first time I heard about the VXII . I grew up in an orphanage camp behind the wall , that was built to protect us from infection . The only memories I have of my childhood are the backwoods death matches in the camp . Only the strongest survived . Sentenza , Jude , Cane , Vitor and I were the only ones left . They are the only family I 've ever known . We called ourselves , the Drifters . Eventually , we grew up and went our separate ways . Some of us never escaped the violence- - Jude , for one . The last I heard , he 's gaming the Vespers and left a trail of mutilated bodies around the city . I fear that when the time comes , the only one who can stop him ... is one of us . I haven 't heard from anyone else for years . Maybe they found some peace and quiet ... maybe not . I like to think that everything happens for a reason , But still , I 'm waiting . Hawthorne Medic Station 12 and 13 July 2039 Never learn , do you ? How many weeks do you need before you take your job seriously ? Just one more . You 're a joke , you know that ? You can 't hold a job for more than a few months . Yeah . I know , people talk . Everybody wants to give their two cents about you . What 's yours ? I don 't have one . But I 'll say this : If you ever find yourself wondering what you 're doing or where you 're going , if you ever find yourself wondering why you 're here , just stay quiet and follow my lead . Alright , I 'll keep that in mind . If you 're not going to take this seriously , why are you here ? I mean , why do you even bother coming ? Forget it . She 's the doctor 's granddaughter . What 's she gonna want with a bum like you ? Look busy , the captain is coming over . What 's he gonna do stick us behind the wall ? Wall ? What wall ? Yeah , I thought it was there . - He is right , you know . - Sir ! Which one of you cleaned the West Wing last night ? Oh , that was me , sir . We received several complaints this morning . you forgot to put up the wet floor sign , you didn 't bother with the second floor bathrooms , and you forgot to unload the boxes for the medics . Tell me , do you think this is acceptable behavior for the head janitor ? I 'm s-sorry sir . I forgot . One of the medics slipped . That 'll set us back a whole day . It was- - excuse me , sir . I was planning on doing that this morning . Come here . What 's your name ? Shawn . Where are you from ? Skins . You ever seen a Vesper up close ? No . Looters and killers . I 've seen Jude Black myself . He looks a bit like you . I don 't think so . I could use a man like you . Posse Comitatus . You know what that means ? I conscript you to catch Jude Black . Can I count on you ? Let 's hope you don 't . You don 't have to do this . You have no idea , do you ? None of this would be happening if the wall didn 't exist . What did he say ? He said none of this would be happening if the wall didn 't exist . Yes ? You 're a hard man to reach , sir And who are you ? Shawn . I work here . They say you are the expert on VXII . That you 've been here since the beginning . What do you want ? I have been looking into the virus lately , but its been hard getting my hands on anything useful . They say , you 're the man to talk to . Is it true ? Can we tear down the wall if we found the cure ? Oh , I 'm sorry , not only is that far too speculative , but the risk is paramount . There is no cure . - But what if we- - - I said there isn 't any . To find a cure , we have to have the carriers and we don 't have those because no one survived . I 'm a reasonable man . You want to do research ; tell me your plans . I read your book and ah , I thought- - Yes ? And , uh , funding ? Experience ? Some . Education ? Self-taught . Self-taught ? I see many boys like you . Do you know the best advice I can give you ? What ? Go home . Wherever that might be . And now , if you have nothing of value to say , I have more important things to do . Thank you . ( Dr. Lei ) : Spot , did you hear that ? ( Elsa ) : I 'm not fighting you ! ( Dr. Lei ) : You don 't know what you 're doing . ( Dr. Lei ) : Elsa , come back here ! Were you here this whole time ? What ? I ' m sorry . I didn 't know you were here . Where did you get this ? You can 't touch it without gloves , it will paralyze you . You know you don 't have to do this . They 'll laugh at you . Yeah , they 're already laughing . There 's no cure , believe me , the doctor and I have gone over this already . - Sorry . - I know what you 're gonna say : It 's never been done before and I 'm not gonna be the one to do it , right ? Why don 't you go home , get some rest ? all I have waiting at home for me is a hard bed and an empty fridge . at least in here , I 've got something good going . This equation 's wrong . What ? Kirchhoff 's , you must have copied it wrong . It can 't be . I think I can write it . See , this is it . It 's Okay , I got it wrong the first time too . Gentlemen ! I feel it my obligation and my duty to inform you that among us sits an impostor . A man who has no recognizable papers from any institution . In fact , that man is a fraud ... and is wanted by the law in Cicades , Hawthorne and two other cities in this quarantine ! Go get him ! How did you come across that information ? What information ? When were you in Cicades ? Cicades ? Never been there . Where did you meet the guy ? Never seen him before . Never even heard of him . You got quite a reputation , Shawn I like that . What do you want ? I 've been watching you . Name 's Dryden . Did you see the corpse ? Which one ? Thought you might recognize him . Friend of yours , I think . They say Jude Black did it . You know him ? No . I 've seen you two together before . Long time ago , of course . I dont know what are you talking about . That 's no way to talk about your brother . Well , he 's not my brother . Then I guess it won 't bother you . What ? That there is a bounty on his head . No , not at all . See you around . Hey ! - Jude . - It 's me . I need to talk to you . You can find me outside in the streets of Cicades . You remember , right ? Do it already . Cicades - Vesper Territory It 's been too long . I know . You haven 't stopped by . I was busy . I knew you 'd say that . Sit . What ? You too good for it now ? It was never a problem before . Where did you get it ? Relax , it was a gift . So what do you wanna do tonight ? Uh , I ' m pretty busy . I 've got an idea . How about you and I go rape some bitches and bury them in the desert ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . We 'll bring condoms . It was a joke . I am glad to see you . So where are you staying ? Hawthorne . Doing what ? I work at the medic 's station . Picking-up other people 's trash ? You 've been doing the same shit for six years , Shawn . When are you going to grow up ? It 's just a job . Do you ever hear from the Drifters ? No , do you ? I 've been meaning to see them . I wish I had earlier . Sentenza 's dead . Oh , really ? May he rest in peace then . Two brothers . You raped and you killed . No one can say I liked Sentenza . You remember that , right ? Jude , tell me you remember . Jude ! Tell me you remember , Jude ! Jude ! Tell me you killed Sentenza ! Get out of my sight ! It 's a common thing in nature , you know ? Sibling rivalry . Brothers , they um , beat each other . Sometimes to death . I can remember when I was younger me and my ... ah , well , I didn 't have a brother , I had a sister . Where is Jude ? Well , he left before I got here . You know , we should get you out of here now . What do you want from me ? What do you want for yourself ? I want to talk to my brother . But you don 't know where he is . I can help you with that . Where is he ? Oh no , I never make the same mistake twice . I 'll take you there . Then what ? Uh , details . We 'll ah , figure that out along the way . What makes you think I 'll go with you ? Well for one , the Vespers are coming . And you can thank your brother for that . He wouldn 't do that . He killed Sentenza . You don 't know that . And you do ? Come on , we 're wasting time , lets go . Can you fight ? Of course . You work for the militia ? Why would I work for the militia ? How do you know where Jude is ? I am a businessman . I follow the money . Who hired you for the bounty then ? Nobody important . The deal is Jude stays alive . I need to find out why he 's in this mess before it 's too late . You got that ? I 'm just trying to help you . You know what 's going to happen if someone else finds Jude first ? - Stop the car . - What ? - Stop the car ! - No . What do you- - what do you- - Just stop the car ! Hey , where you goin ' ? The nearest city is 50 miles . You 're hustling me . Why would I hustle you ? Are you crazy ? The Vespers should be here by now . Are you trying to get us killed ? Get in the car , we 'll talk about it on the way . We can 't outrun them for long . Well , not at this rate we ca- - You said you could fight . I lost my blade , what was I supposed to do ? You think the militia 's gonna help ya ' ? They don 't care about you . Come on , give me a chance . Why are you still here ? Hey , look , you dont know how to use a blade- - I- - I could train you . What ? You don 't believe me ? Come on . Hey , come on , give me a try . Come on . Alright , hit me . Come on . Come on , I 'll show you , hit me . Let 's go , come on . Come on , let 's go hit me hit me . Alright , hit me . I wasn 't ready . Hold on . OK . Alright , ready . Wa-wa-wait . Alright , now I 'm ready . How did you do that ? Come on , I 'll show you . Do I have to remind you , that if I did that in combat , you 're dead . I don 't usually actually have to fight . Come on , you give it a try . Come on . Again . Go ! Again , come on . Nice try . You gotta ' ... you gotta ' to feel it . You got- - Yeah ! Hey , where you goin ' ? To find back up . Wha- - I thought I was your back up . We don 't need anybody else . Everybody else wants Jude dead . I am gonna find the Drifters . You know what , that 's a bad idea . I mean , who the hell are they ? They are my brothers . The only brother you have has a bounty on his head . What , were they your brothers because you were in some children 's home together ? Some home . But yeah , they were . With Sentenza dead and Jude wanted there 's only three of us left . You two can put an end to this right now . No , forget it , never mind . Deal 's off . What can you do without me ? What can you do without a car ? Make a right . You know , the last time , this Sentenza son-of-a-bitch comes along , and he just- - I thought you say you didn 't know him . Well , I said I hardly knew him . You know , I mean , we weren 't friends or anything , we just wanted the bounty . It--it doesn 't matter . Back to the issue ... you know , loyalty , character , integrity . do I make sense ? You 're right . Sentenza wasn 't the brightest guy . But Vitor was different . Everyone knew Vitor . This one time Vitor and I were stuck on- - Is this story gonna go anywhere ? I mean , Vitor was strong , Everyone knew that . But he had brains . He 'll know how to handle Jude . What ? Nothing . Let 's just test him , see how how well he responds . What are you thinking ? Well , Sentenza betrayed me . I 'm telling you , you can 't trust anybody . You 're still mad at me , aren 't you ? Alright , look . Here . I want you to take the keys as a symbol of my trust . - Really ? - Yeah . Just park the car . Vitor 's Bungalow You thief ! Kane ! Shawn ? So where is Vitor ? I didn 't know you two were living together . Drinks ? So where is the bruiser ? That way we can catch up on old times . I don 't know how he 'll react when he sees you . Well I know its been a while , but I really need to talk to him . What 's on your mind ? You remember the internment camps ? When the guards weren 't around we practically ran the place . It 's a shame only a few of us survived . You know , we should 've stuck together . Do you remember that joke , two evil brothers ? Nobody could say it like Sentenza . He 's dead isn 't he ? Jude actually did him in ? Well , ah , I don 't know , but they want to kill him . - I mean , Vitor can- - - Vitor is not around . Look , I 'm sorry you came all this way . Where is he ? Vi--Vitor can talk some sense into him . He is the only one . Vitor ! Vitor ! Come out here . You have a visitor . Mmm . Mmmh . Want juice ? What happened to him ? About a year ago , he went to see Jude . I found him nose down with his head split open . If you get into this , I don 't know if you can get out . I can 't take him alone . - You 've got to - - - Don 't ask me . I 'm sorry brother . I 'm sorry . So how 'd it go ? Oh , it was great . We caught up on old times . Shared a couple storie had a couple laughs . They 're doing great . I 'm happy for them . They couldn 't believe how much I 've changed . They still think I 'm the skinny little kid who used to follow them around . Yeah . They 're a little tied-up right now , but they told me they 'd back me when I need them . Vitor told me to stay a while , but I told him I had to go . I dont want them knowing that you were around . It 's alright , no one does . Those guys , they never change . Hawthorne Precinct Station Captain Troufeau 's Office I 'm starting to think you don 't like me . ( llaughing ) Quite the opposite . The gentlemen here , wish to extend the hand of friendship . As friends , we 'd like to discuss an issue with you . But first , How are your operations ? Running . That 's wonderful . I 'd like to say the same , but ah , well ... I 'll let you in on a little secret . Nobody really knows anything . We 're all just trying to cover our own bottoms . I know . It 's surprising . After the raids a few days ago , you do remember ? What raids ? ( laughing ) No need to feign ignorance . We are all friends here . Ah . The ones you authorized , mmh , the ones that occurred a few days ago . I was surprized when my secretary mentioned the extra body count . Several of their heads were bound with cloth and their eyes were gauged out . Oh , that 's funny ? You think that 's funny ? ( laughing ) Are you laughing at me ? You think I 'm a joke ? Listen Jude , I pay you off every month and I am sick of getting the short end . Now , I 'm trying not to raise my voice , but you 're making it very difficult . You think I 'm some punk you can scare ? I 'm sick of you coming into this office and expecting me to kiss your ass . It 's your fault . I own you now . Oh , that 's right , Jude Black- - Everybody is afraid of you ! Well there 's a bounty on your head . Some good doctor , Erick Lei . What do you think of that ? You 've got APEX on your trail and then some . And I 'm the only one that can help you now . ( laughs ) Do you like classical music ? To tell you the truth , I don 't have time for it . Oh , you should make time for it . Its really quite good . Do You like that ? You 're becoming quite a liability to us . Give yourself up . We 'll stage an arrest . Do you want to live your life like a hunted animal ? I expect an answer tomorrow . Only , don 't contact me from now on , deal only with my secretary . You 're a fucking cancer . Road to Immogen Lar We 're gonna cross the desert here , through Cicades by taking that road . Uh-oh . What ? Ahhgh . Augh ! I 'm not having any fun , but it 's rolling . Aah ... It looks like looks like we 've got some company . - They can 't be Vespers . - Oh , boy ! You got any suggestions here ? Well , watch their hands . If it goes over the belt , don 't hesitate . Great- - - Don 't let them know we 're stranded . - Right . You having troubles ? No trouble here . I know you ? I don 't think so . Name 's Pete . Mmm . You know actually we could use some help . We 're ah , we 're looking for Jude Black . I have to- - Oh , sorry . I--I got a hundred Marks , here , if you guys got any information . I heard he 's heading south . You 'll have to back track . See I told you ! God , you idiot ! I- - I told him , he was head- - I-I knew we were going in the wrong direction . Man ! You guys saved us a lot of time , you know . I mean , I 'd kiss you if I could . Here . Take it all . You could- - you can have it all . Yeah , there you go . Thanks a lot guys , really appreciate it . You guys saving me- - Boy ! Boy . Thanks . ( chuckles ) What ? Ah , you can buy anybody with money . I got you . You see the weapons they were carrying ? - Yeah . - It 's APEX . It 's our biggest competition . You just lost yourself a hundred Marks . Yeah , well , these guys want us out of the game and ... now they think we 're out of the game . Like I said , anybody can be bought for a price . Hey , how about I ah , I steer , you push ? What ? Do you have to stand right next to me ? Alright , geez ! Hello . Elsa , its me . Shawn ? Where have you been ? They took him . They took Dr. Lei . - You sure ? - Yeah . You 're positive ? She 'll come . She- - She 's bringing water , right ? Your friends are dead . Troufeau is dead . You 're the only one left . Does the name VXII mean anything to you Dr. Lei ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You should , you created it . The virus Dr. Lei . No ! No wait , I didn 't do anything ! Please stop ! Aaah ! Let him go ! Just what do you want ? What do you want ? Just trying to see you . I want to turn the generators off in this quadrant . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I had nothing to do with it . You 've got the wrong man . Just let us go . I 'll give you anything you want . - What do you want ? - To break out of the wall . You can 't . There 's nothing out there . No , please ! No ! For God 's sake ! Please , I 'm begging you ! They made me do it . I was just following orders . You think I want this ? You think I 'd do this to my own family ? To my own grandaughter ? They forced me to do it . I didn 't have a choice . I got nothing . Same as you . What do you want ? First , tell me how to turn off the generators ! Are you guys ready ? Okay . - You 're staying here . - Why ? If something happens to us , you get out of here , okay ? He 's my grandfather . Okay , fine . Come with me . We 'll go through the back . - Ready ? - Yeah . You wait a couple of minutes and then come through the front . Okay . The lights are on . Come on . Do you think anyone else knows about this place ? Shawn , there 's another room down the hallway . What is this ? What do you think ? Life beyond the wall . - No ? - Yes . We 're the carriers . No , you 're lying . No , they lied to us . We 've been quarantined . And they 've left us in the desert to rot . No , you 're wrong ! Who can you trust , Shawn ? I 'm your brother . Trust ? Did Sentenza trust you ? Vitor ? They betrayed me . We 're leaving the quarantine . You 're either with me or you 're against me . I thought you meant to back down . Bear with me . You 'll die Jude . We 're already dead . Jude , it 's APEX . It 's not your time . Doc-doctor , come on , let 's go . - What about the doctor ? - We got what we wanted . You 're coming with us . Vespers ! Come on ! Show me that you can . This why I wanted to come back here . Its a blueprint . It 's the power generator room . It 's happening already . It 's shutting the power down . They 'll target the main officials first , what 's left of them , the rest will run . We have to get as far away from here as possible . - I have to tell Shawn about this . - I don 't want you seeing him , Elsa I never liked that boy . There 's always something wrong with him . He 's always hiding something . You made the VXII ? That was an accident . Making a biological weapon wasn 't an accident . So what do you want me to say ... that we 're stuck here and we 're gonna. die ? Where 'd you go ? Oh , I thought I 'd bring back some beetillo . It 's amazing something this weak can grow in a wasteland . You know , people would pay good money for this . I 'm thinking about opening-up my own cart . Some place up north . What do you think ? You got your reward . Yup . I fixed my car too . So what are you gonna do now ? I don 't know . I can 't blow away my new life-savings ... quickly . What about you ? How you gonna spend the last of your days ? What do you mean ? Come on- - Jude won 't get far . And , they 'll burn this place down before he reaches the outside . You think they want any trace of this virus ? I 'd ah , go with you but , we both know I 'd be in the way , right ? Yeah . Shawn , wait . How 's the doctor ? He 's-he 's doing alright . You 're gonna be okay . Dryden ? We need to help Shawn find out how to turn the power back on . Grandpa , Grandpa , I don 't blame you . What do you think you 're doing ? Go and get my papers . These are all my notes on the VXII , Creation , intention , everything . What am I supposed to do with them ? Even you couldn 't figure it out . You 're right . I couldn 't figure it out . Should we shut down the third generator ? Not yet . I don 't want to call attention to ourselves . The propaganda , the lies , it all ends now . If we breach the wall , they 'll be forced to find a cure . We 'll finally be free . You shouldn 't have come . I let you go . You don 't know what you 're doing . I don 't know what I 'm doing ? You 're gonna get yourself killed and everyone else with you . It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . Let it go Jude ! - Some of us want to live . - Then get out of my way ! Who are you ? A friend . Nothing 's changed . I 'm weak and I 'm alone . So alone . Small again . Nothing 's changed . Jude Black . We 're federal agents from the NDC . We have armed forces around the wall . We will not let you out . Let 's get out of here . Come on , lets go ! You really took it this time . You find someone to fix that up before you bleed out . Jude , - I 'm s- - - It 's alright . I 'll take care of this . Say something extra to the pastor for me , will ya ? Make sure they call me a saint . Okay Shawn ? Okay ? Okay . Jude , Jude Black . We will launch an assault if you do not come out . You have twenty seconds to come out . You 'll be okay . What will we do now ? Live , Shawn . Live .

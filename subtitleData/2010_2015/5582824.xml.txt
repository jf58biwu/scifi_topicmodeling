Since his arrival on the scene Just over a month ago , the Hunter has captured the Public 's attention as the Common man 's answer to Providence . He 's inspired a devout Following , including the Makings of his own private Army . hunter cain : We 're dealing With an epidemic here , and We 're the cure . When something is making you Sick , you cut it out . and what of providence 's Secret weapon ? No longer so secret ? hunter cain : How can we Protect our children from this Disease when the very thing We 're fighting against is Walking free among u but you know you can 't catch Evo , like a cold . hunter cain : Says who ? Providence scientists ? You 're gonna trust them ? We need to protect ourselves From this rex and every other Sicko like him . People should be able to draw Their own conclusions . Here 's my conclusion - - you 're a Lying wack job ! bobo : You know he can 't hear You , right ? Now can we finish this ? See there ? Nothing to worry about . Your old pal rex making the Streets safe . Uh , curing evos ? Saving cute puppies ? noah : Somebody 's off their Game . rex : I 'm just warming up . noah : We 've been playing for An hour .

Whatever they have is working . rex : Que pasa , people ? six : Glad you could make it . rex : Tired of seeing someone Else do my job . Poorly , I might add . hunter cain : Not this time , Freak . six : Rex ! rex : Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! hunter cain : Can 't you just Die already ? ! rex : I don 't do dying . You 're not so ...

You decide . rex : Well , a few people get It . That 's a start . bobo : What can I say that I Haven 't said already ? Humans are idiots . But every once in a while , they get it right .

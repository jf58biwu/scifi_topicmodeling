 Previously on alphas ... Parish 's organization is huge and nasty and about to pull the trigger on something big . - Aah ! - One dead , three injured . That 's the fifth attack on the power grid this week . In a day or two we 'll have these power grid protectors in place everywhere so Parish will have a hard time keeping this up . October 22 , 1862 . That is when Stanton Parish discovered he was an Alpha . 150 years to the day . Terrorists love anniversaries . The doctor said that my mom is either gonna die or she 'll be able to come home . But he won 't tell me which and he won 't tell me when . We did not kill Dani . Stanton Parish did . You know that if Cley catches Parish he 'll put him in prison . He doesn 't deserve to go to prison . No . Hello , Cornell . Uhh ! This has gone far enough . Oh , my God . What the hell did you people do ? This is what I designed for Parish . It 's a mini photostim controller . Power goes in , flashes come out . It 's like steroids for an Alpha . If it doesn 't kill you , it makes you stronger . What happens to people who aren 't alphas ? Mostly they die . Look , whatever he 's planning , he 's planning to do it all over the place . I mean , look at this . Cameron , you need to get all of this information to Bill . No , look , I 'm not leaving you here . You have a family . I don 't . You take this . You might need it . Where 's Parish ? Is he here ? I 'm gonna watch the world change with a God 's eye view . What do you mean God 's eye view ? Wh--wh--what is that ? Hey , Dr. Rosen . Uhh . Wake up . Dani ... Oh , no . Now I 'm in shock . I 'm hallucinating . You can 't pass out . - I need to get to a hospital . - No . No , I can 't . They report gunshot wounds to the police . - Anyway , there 's no time . - You don 't have time . You have to find him . - I have to find him . - You have to find him . I 've gotta find him . But I 've gotta stop the bleeding or I 'll never make it . You know who can help you . Yes . Good . Good . Get up . Now get up . Uhh ! Agh . They found Rosen 's blood . And a worker at the Armory heard gunshots . Okay , but we need to find him . Rosen 's out there alone . He 's bleeding . Listen , I will put a BOLO out on him , all right ? But we cannot afford to waste any time . Be on the lookout ? That 's it ? Our number one priority right now is to stop Parish . Now , if Rosen was here , he would say the same thing . Oh . Got it . You need surgery . Fiona , I came to you . Okay . So this part 's gonna hurt . I need to seal the major blood vessels . So take a deep breath for me . Good . Ready ? Ohh . All right . Did what I could , but my ability isn 't magic , so you 're gonna need to take it easy . I don 't want you to split yourself open again . There 's a couch in my office if you wanna use it . Thank you , but I--I don 't have time . Whoa . Okay , wait a minute . If you 're going anywhere , your next stop has to be the E.R. I 'm serious . I know , I know , I just ... There 's something important I need to do . So the best we 're gonna do is- - He 's a plumber . He 's never heard of Stanton Parish . What the hell was he doing in the Armory ? Putting in extra bathrooms . Really ? Stanton 's that concerned about his supercharged alphas being nice and comfortable ? After everyone else is dead . We don 't know where the photostims are , how they 're gonna be deployed , what 's gonna set ' em off . Why don 't you go back in there and push the rest of ' em . See what you can find out . You get those line reports on NYPD ? All right , look , I get it , okay ? Obviously you 're mad . Yeah , that happens when I 'm nearly incinerated . Listen to me , you were not supposed to be on that convoy . Yeah , but you let me go anyway . 'Cause you figured in a month I 'll just forget what a total douche you are , right ? I did what I had to do . Okay ? It wasn 't about you . Kat . Kat , where you going ? I 'm out of here . Hey . Kat , you cannot leave . What are you doing ? You know this thing is about to go down . It can happen any time within the next 24 hours . Remind me why I should care . Because there are 8 million people in the city alone . Yeah and I don 't know any of them . The only people I know are in that room , and they hung me out to dry . Have I hung you out to dry ? Have I ? Kat , listen to me . I need you . Yo , Jones , how 's the security retrofit coming ?

I find it unseasonably humid , but that 's what you get when you screw with mother nature . Mm , selfish bastards . They did the best they could . And after tonight some of them will be changed . And the rest ... Well , it should be quick and painless . Well , I got all my guys sat down at the backup generator . Good . Gather up Dr. Rosen , take him to the safe house . Be convincing , but no unnecessary violence . Yeah , about that ... Yes ? Uh , Rosen showed up in Yonkers last night . He was planning on taking you down , boss , so I ... you know , kind of shot him . You did what ? Where is he ? I don 't know , he took off in his car . He 's probably dead already . Look , I was--I was just looking out for you . Okay ? Do you know ... that it is pointless to kill in anger ? I was just thinking that .

Yeah , seven people were admitted with gunshot wounds last night , but--but that 's not unusual . That 's only two more than average . Gary , was Rosen one of the patients ? No , and I checked all the morgues too , and they haven 't got his body . So that 's good , un- - unless the just haven 't found his body yet . 'Cause dead bodies are good at hiding . I have to go to my mom 's room . All right , Gary . The nurse keeps calling me . - Just keep looking , okay ? - Yeah , of course I will . Open- - I should never have left Rosen . That was Rosen 's call . I mean , he sent you back here . All he wanted was justice for Dani . We both did . Now he 's seeing it through . I let her down . What happened ? Did she die ? No , Agent Bell . Oh . You woke up . Hey . Hey , Mom . Watch your step there , princess . You know , I didn 't need you to come along with me . Believe me , it was not by choice . So you really think this has something to do with Parish ? Five unexplained deaths , today of all days ? It has to be connected . We need to find out what killed them . Could it be noxious fumes ? This place smells like ass . Traces of methane , sulfur , carbon monoxide . It 's not enough to be toxic . I 'm really surprised you can hack it . One fart in an elevator and you freak out . Hey ! What 's your problem ? Well you almost got me killed , so there 's that . I 'm sorry about that . It was a complicated situation . You know , beyond that it 's just this whole lack of loyalty thing pisses me off . You weren 't there , okay ? It went too far . You decided it went too far . If you 're gonna sign up for something stupid and dangerous , have the balls to see it through . Pick a side . Shh ! What ? Shh . It 's a heartbeat . I hear someone . He 's scared . Whoa , whoa , whoa , it 's okay , it 's okay . Hey , we 're here to help . It 's okay . It 's okay . Were you here ? Do you want to tell us what you saw ? Just tell us what 's wrong . This is ridiculous . Find Parish . I have no idea where to look for him . Yes , you do . The bastard told you . Through Mitchell . I 'm gonna watch the world change with a God 's eye view . God 's eye view . I 'll watch the world change with a God 's eye view . And where the hell is that ? You 'll figure it out . You know who you can trust . Okay , so the lights flash , leave five men dead , and the only survivor left is an Alpha . Or he was turned into an Alpha . I mean , he seemed really freaked out when he made that noise . This had to be caused by a photostim . A photostim ? Well , that 'd be connected to the power lines , right ? Great , so we search a gazillion miles of- - Rachel , what is it ? It 's a grid protector . We put these in the power system to protect it from Parish . And he put a photostim inside . We screwed ourselves . Parish played us . They could be all over the country , Rachel . Thanks for coming back . We need the help . Well , I made these things for Parish so some of this is on me . All right , what set this thing off ? Was it a remote ? A timer ? What ? No . The workers . They smashed it with a hammer . Men are idiots . Thanks . 8 : 18 . That 's when this thing was supposed to go off . 8 : 18 tonight . Evil , twisted son of a bitch . Every light on this grid will flash . If you open the fridge , you get zapped . We got crews pulling ' em out , but we 're talking over a million in 19 different cities . They don 't have time . I mean , it took these guys a month to put these things in . We can 't just take ' em out in a couple hours . We have to cut the power . It 's the only way . Pull the plug on the national grid until we can rip all these things out . Is that even possible on the time we have left ? I 'll get things started on it . It won 't work in New York . The lines have dead man switches . It means the systems keep going no matter what . That 's right , it 's--it 's a 9 / 11 thing . The system can 't shut down all at once . So how we gonna get past this ? Me . All right . What do you need ? You have to transfer her right now , not in 24 hours . You know , I 'm a federal agent . You have to do exactly what I say . I 'll see what I can do to hurry things along . Yeah , hurry things along . Get on with it . - Gary ? - What- - Oh , Dr. Rosen , what are you doing here ? - Hey , Gary- - - I need help . I need to get my mom out . Bill said it 's not safe . I wanna move her somewhere safe now . - Oh , how is she doing ? - Oh , she 's boring . She 's awake , but she 's just staring . Mom ! Gary , I 'm sorry I haven 't been here for you during all of this . I 've--I 've been busy . Yeah , you were busy- - you kidnapped someone , held them prisoner . No , I was - - That takes time . - I was doing what I could to stop Stanton Parish , you know ? Yeah , to kill him . No , Gary , I was trying to protect people . No , Dr. Rosen , come on . Don 't lie to me . The same way you were trying to protect your mother . No , you 're lying to me . You wanna kill him because of Dani . God 's eye view , Gary . What is that ? I don 't know what it means . I need your help . I imagine God 's eye view- - it has to be high up , and it obviously has some significance for him . Well , his family own lots of boats , but they 're not very tall . They also own some stables . It--I don 't like horses . They look confused . There 's Shreve , Lamb , and Harmon . What 's that ? Oh , they 're architects , and Stanton Parish is on the Board of Directors . And they--oh , oh , oh ! They built the Empire State building . God 's eye view . Time to go . And tell him you won 't see him again because you 're gonna die . Gary ... working with you means- - means so much to me . I--seeing the world through your eyes has been very special . Oh , yeah , I know . I 'm amazing . Thank you . Yeah . Oh , wait , Dr. Rosen . Mm ? They 're looking for you . You know that . I- - I should call them because they could help you . No , Gary , please , don 't--don 't do that . I have to ask you to keep this--keep this conversation just between the two of us . It 's very important . I don 't want any of you to have to , uh , to- - to have to share this ... Uh , all of this . You understand ? Yeah , I understand . Thank you , Gary . Oh , what am I gonna do when I find him ? You stop him . How ? How am I gonna stop him ? How does he heal ? How does he heal ? Yes . Okay . All right , he must have some sort of enhanced neural immune response system . It 's gotta be voluntary so that he can actually will his axons to regenerate . Yes . And I need to inhibit that response . Anti-coagulants . Methotrexate . So if he were injured severely enough ... He wouldn 't be able to heal . It would be done . - This is a big hospital . - Yes . It 'll have everything you need . Oh , God . What the hell am I doing ? I 've never stolen anything in my life . Aren 't you doing what 's right ? God , I don 't even know I believe in what I 'm doing anymore . Well , he does . He did what he thought was right , and he is not giving up . I know , I know . Oh , Dani . Ever since you died , I- - I didn 't die . I was murdered . Oh , God , where am I ? The Empire State building . Uh ... I don 't know where the hell am I. Oh , I 'll never make it . I 've lost too much blood . Take the one to the shuttle . Transfer at Grand Central station . Yes . Grand Central station . NYPD flagged this off the BOLO . It 's definitely Rosen , and he 's not looking good . All right , what did he take ? Wayfarin and heparin , which are blood thinners . And then there was MXT , which is a chemo drug . I- - I don 't get it , I mean , he 's obviously hurt . Why didn 't he take painkillers ? There was Vicodin and Percocet in the cabinet , but ... He 's bleeding . Blood thinners aren 't gonna help him . I know . Come on , doc , what the hell are you doing ? He shouldn 't have done that . Dr. Rosen , he--he 's really angry about Dani dying . Just like I was angry about Anna ... and he 's doing bad things . Go . Oh , that- - Mom , you just spoke . That 's good . Help him . I 'm not--I , no , I--I can 't help him . I promised him that I wouldn 't- - I wouldn 't tell anyone if he was in trouble . But I--what is that ? What are you- - what is this ? I 'm gonna stay here with you . Take care of you . What is--wh- - go . Go ... I should go ? Go . Mom , I ... Yeah . Okay . I 'll--I 'll go . Oh , I 'm glad that you didn 't die , Mom . You close ? Clock 's ticking . We got maybe an hour . No , really ? Stop bugging us . Is that my laptop ? We needed your logic board . We gotta punch through the failsafes if we 're gonna kill all the power in New York . It died with honor . Out ! He 's so pretty , but so useless . - He 's smarter than he looks . - Ooh . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to insult the man you love . I don 't love Hicks . Okay , aren 't you almost done with that ? Yep . Guess it 's time to go save the world . I brought you here when you were eight years old , Dani . Your mother and I. We all took a tour of the station . Right here . Wanted to show you the constellations in the sky , but they 're backwards . Heh . The tour guide said it was a mistake , but the painter , Paul Helleu , said that he painted them that way because he wanted people to see the stars from the other side of the sky . Heh . God 's eye view . He 's not at the Empire State building . He 's here . Thank you , sir . The 7 : 15 Express from Stanford now arriving at track three . All passengers can be met in the main concourse . FEMA has completed power down in all Parish-affected cities . Local authorities standing by for power down in New York . So you sure this is gonna work ? I 'm never sure . Best case , yeah . Okay . Worst case ? Worst case , this thing sets off an explosive chain reaction that kills everybody we 're trying to save . Okay . Yeah . That 's worst . Okay , just do it . Now arriving on track 101 on the lower level . Everyone , take it easy ! You did it . Even after all that crap you pulled . You did it . We did it . Mostly I did it . Whatever . Yay , team . Midtown , the power 's coming back on . It 's spreading north . Where else ? It 's just New York , as far as I can see . It 's working . Should be killing every transformer on the grid . Then where 's the power coming from ? See , nothing to worry about . Oh . Oh , Dr. Rosen . Oh , Dr. Rosen . Dr. Rosen . Gary . Oh , no , Gary . Gary , what are you doing here ? Oh , you 're bleeding . That 's why I 'm here , Dr. Rosen . Is that why you took the medicine ? Gary , you have to leave right now . It 's very dangerous for you to be here . Yeah , I know it 's dangerous . You 're bleeding . Please don 't worry about me . You have to go right--right now , Gary . Go , please . I can 't allow you to be here . Parish is here . No , Doc . No , I 'm not gonna go anywhere , Dr. Rosen . I get to make my own choices . Gary , I realize that . No , you don 't realize , Dr. Rosen . Okay ? You 're bleeding and you 're alone . - Gary , I 'm fine . - You 're not fine . You help everyone on the team like you 've helped me and like my mom helps me so now it 's fair , Dr. Rosen , that I help you . I 'm not gonna go anywhere , okay ? It 's my turn . It 's my turn . - Okay , Gary . - Yep . - All right . - That 's okay . It 's a backup generator somewhere and it 's big . Putting out enough power to light up half the city . Those should be shut down too . Anything with a solid state trip switch , unless it 's really old . Okay , well , whatever it is we got 45 minutes to take it down . - Rachel . - Well , we 'll get everyone we got looking for that power source . Okay , thanks . That was Gary . He 's in Grand Central station . He found Rosen . He thinks Parish is there too . Maybe that 's why the Doc stole those drugs . He 's going after Parish . Come on , Gary , pick up . Cameron ... be safe , okay ? Here . What else do you need to take with you ? For what ? What 's going on ? We 're evacuating . Okay , these things are gonna go off in 40 minutes . We 're moving the command center to the FEMA office in Tarrytown . - We 're giving up ? - No . No , we just need to be prepared for the aftermath . No . You know what these lights did to you last time . Rachel , they could kill you . I 'm not leaving Dr. Rosen . You are an infuriating woman . Because I wanna do the right thing ? What about lying to me ? Hmm ? Was that the right thing ? Letting my Op get ambushed so you could- - so you could kidnap some guy ? I have to be able to trust the woman that I 'm in love with . I mean , don 't you get that ? Of course . Wait a second . Did you say you 're in love with me ? Yeah . Of course . Say it again . I love you . You need to come with me . I can 't . Listen , we find Parish to stop this whole thing from happening . Okay , Bill , why would Parish go to Grand Central station ? 'Cause with his freaky logic , he wants to be in the middle of everything when it goes down . Yeah , and make sure it happens . All right , so what 's in Grand Central station ? Restaurants , the Apple store ... trains , tracks . There 's a generator that 's designed to keep the trains running even if everything else in the city goes down , but that 's just for trains . No , that 's the M42 . It 's from the ' 30s . It can put out enough power for half of Manhattan . How do you know this ? Uh , I don 't know . Somebody must have shown me . Maybe I took a tour . It 's under Grand Central somewhere . Okay . That 's our generator . All right , hold on . Dr. Rosen , I can 't get very good reception here . It 's all brick . I 'll have to go up to the main box . I 'll be able to see Parish on the security camera . Gary , be careful . Yeah . Oh , Dr. Rosen , don 't- - don 't get shot again . Attention , Metro North customers . - Lee Rosen ? - Mm-hmm ? 714 Express train to New Haven , making it first stop in Stamford , is now available for boarding on track 28 . Lee . You have no idea how glad I am to see you alive . I 'd very much like you to stay that way . Stanton , where are you ? We need to talk , face to face . Soon . Something I have to finish first . No . No , you do not have to finish this . You--haven 't--haven 't you seen enough blood ? Yes ... too much . But there won 't be any blood . It 'll be quick and clean . What ? What , this is- - this is your final solution ? A new beginning . For this small island , at least . There is a storage closet ten yards in front of you on the south wall- - it 's a gray door . Go inside . The light has been disabled . You 're part of this future , Lee . So shut the door and close your eyes . From October 22nd through the 26th ... According to the briefing , that generator should be somewhere around here . You hear something , Rachel ? It 's 150 meters down . Through the Lexington Avenue subway tunnel . Skylar . Bill , Parish wouldn 't leave the generator vulnerable . I 'll cover them . You find Rosen . Come on , let 's go . All right . So ... anybody have any gum or ... Yeah . Everybody down ! - Watch it ! - Unh ! The M42 's down that passageway ! Yeah , awesome , we 'll just skip past the guys with machine guns . Harken , break that ! What is that ? Go , go ! Get down . Rachel , Skylar , go ! Hey . Unh ! Ahh . I need you to throw me . What ? I need you to throw me . Ungh ! Unh ! Hyuh ! Uhh ! It 's old . Really old . Old tech is tough . What did you expect ? Not this old . Let 's get started then . This is one of the first platforms . Watched them build it . Helped pour the concrete . Put this in here when it was still wet . 1913 , Charles Barber . Liberty Head . Pure silver . Surprised no one dug it out . Certainly by now . But I 'm afraid we move through this world too quickly to notice things of true value . Shut up ! Firearm . How crass . She was everything to me , Stanton . And you killed her . Yes , I did . For the greater good . My sweet Danielle was everything to me . You have no right to talk about her . Of course . My apologies . You 'll forgive me , I have to make my way to the main concourse , and you should get yourself to a safe place . Please , Lee , it 's important . This is what you want . What ? Wha--what do you want from me ? You don 't know ? In a few minutes , I 'll be a mass murderer . I 'll have served my purpose . I can 't kill the damn thing . Parish crosswired and hardened every access point . I 'm gonna try to pull all the breakers . You 'll be the man they need . I want you to lead them . Kill him . He murdered me , Daddy . He murdered your little girl ! Just put him in the ground ! No . No . No , I 'm not gonna do it . I 'm not that man . Because Danielle wouldn 't have wanted it this way . She knew there was a better way . I couldn 't find it . Well , we should have looked harder . That 's what she would have wanted . Bill , Kat , help Skylar . Rosen and Parish were talking . I heard a gunshot . Okay . Okay . Hey , keep working on that . - Okay . - Which way ? He 's already starting to heal , Doc . Now I know you 've got those drugs . Let 's finish this . - No , Cameron . - Shoot him up ! You kill this bastard and let 's get the hell out of here . Cameron ... If we kill him , what does that make us ? He killed Dani . I know . I know . But if we let him live ... He 'll live with that pain forever . Don 't do it , Cameron . Be the man that she loved . Cam ? These aren 't all the breakers . There 's another panel on the opposite side of the building . Why would they split them ? Security reasons . So people like you and I can 't shut it down , which is smart . We can 't kill the generator from here . The outgoing lines , they have to run through this panel somewhere . We 'll cut ' em . Shut down power to the rest of the city . That 's great , we can save New York , but what about the lights in the station ? They 're hardwired into the generator , aren 't they ? We 're screwed , right ? Doc ! Hicks ! What happened ? Oh , it 's time . Run !

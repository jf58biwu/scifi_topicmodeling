 Get Charlie . Dr. Holloway ! Charlie ! What ? Come quick ! Did you date it ? Thirty-five thousand years . Maybe older . You gotta be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . I mean , it 's gotta predate the others by millennia . I think they want us to come and find them . Yeah . What happened to that man ? He died . Why aren 't you helping them ? They don 't want my help . Their god is different than ours . Why did he die ? Because sooner or later , everyone does . Like Mummy ? Like Mummy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Heaven . Paradise . Whatever it 's called , it 's someplace beautiful . How do you know it 's beautiful ? Because that 's what I choose to believe . What do you believe , Ellie ? Good morning , David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this matter of articulation is attested in the Indo-European descendants as a purely paralinguistic form it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennia or more . Now , let 's attempt Schleicher 's fable . Repeat after me . Perfect . - Mr. Lawrence ? - Yes ? - Flimsy , sir . - Thank you . You 'll do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood ! Michael George Hartley , you 're a philosopher . And you 're balmy . - It damn well hurts ! - Certainly , it hurts . Well , what 's the trick , then ? The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . The trick , William Potter ... is not minding that it hurts . The trick , William Potter ... is not minding that it hurts . Attention : Destination threshold . Attention : Destination threshold . Attention : Destination threshold . Robe . How long ? Two years , four months , 18 days 36 hours , 15 minutes . Any casualties ? Casualties , ma 'am ? Has anyone died ? No , ma 'am . Everyone is fine . Well , then wake them up . Try to relax , Dr. Shaw . My name is David . Your mind and body are in a state of shock ... as a result of the stasis . It 's all right . Perfectly normal . Ellie . We 're here , baby . There , there . Drink plenty of water . Drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . All crew , consume shakes with high caloric content . What the hell is that ? It 's Christmas . Need the holidays to show time is still moving . Mission briefing is about to start , captain . Might wanna make your way down . Well , I haven 't had any breakfast yet . Is this seat taken ? Hi , I 'm Millburn , Biology . Nice to meet you . Okay . Look , no offense , but ... I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . I 'm here to make money . You got that ? Okay . I bet a hundred credits it 's a terraforming survey . No , if it 's a survey , they would just tell us . This is a corporate run , they 're not telling us shit . Come on . - Hundred . - All right , you 're on . You look nervous , El . I 'm trying to keep my feet on the ground . I know you will . Good morning . For those of you I hired personally ... it 's nice to see you again . For the rest of you , I am Meredith Vickers . And it 's my job to make sure you do yours . Okay , then . On with the show . Weyland Corporation . Building better worlds . Hello , friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . I am recording this , 22 June , 2091 . And if you 're watching it , you have reached your destination . And I am long dead . May I rest in peace . There 's a man sitting with you today . His name is David . And he is the closest thing to a son I will ever have . Unfortunately , he is ... He is not human . He will never grow old ... and he will never die . And yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts for that would require the one thing that David will never have . A soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating the questions . Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when we die ? And I have finally found two people who have convinced me they 're on the verge of answering . Drs. Holloway and Shaw , if you would please stand . As far as you 're concerned , they 're both in charge . The Titan Prometheus wanted to give mankind equal footing with the gods and for that , he was cast from Olympus . Well , my friends , the time has finally come for his return . Doctors , please . The floor is yours . Okay , wow . All right . I never had to follow a ghost before . Okay , let me show you why you guys are here . These are images of archeological digs from all over the Earth . That 's Egyptian , Mayan , Sumerian , Babylonian , that 's Hawaiian there at the end , then Mesopotamian . Now , this one here is our most recent discovery . It 's a 35,000-year-old cave painting from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . These are ancient civilizations . They were separated by centuries . They shared no contact with one another , and yet ... The same pictogram showing men worshipping giant beings , pointing to the stars was discovered at every last one of them . And the only galactic system that matched was so far from Earth that there 's no way that , that these primitive , ancient civilizations could have possibly known about it . But it just so happens that that system has a sun a lot like ours . And , based on our long-range scans , there seemed to be a planet . Just one planet with a moon capable of sustaining life . And we arrived there this morning . So you 're saying we 're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave . Is that right ? - No . - Yeah . No . Not a map , an invitation . From who ? We call them Engineers . - Engineers ? - Wow . Do you mind ... telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . Okay , so , uh ... do you have anything to back that up ? I mean , look , if you 're willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism , that 's ... whoo ... But how do you know ? Hmm ? I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors . Ms Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins . Wow , nice place . It 's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support . Air , food . Anything Ms Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment . Okay , so she lives on a lifeboat . Yes . I do . I like to minimize risk . David , why don 't you make the doctors a drink ? I 'll take a vodka . Up . Charlie , look . It 's a Pauling Med-Pod . They only made a dozen of these . Miss Shaw . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expensive piece of machinery . It does bypass surgery . What do you need it for ? I think there might be some confusion about our relationship . Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission . But I 'm fairly certain your " Engineers " are nothing but scribblings of savages living in dirty , little caves . But let 's say I 'm wrong , and you do find these beings down there ... you won 't engage them ... you won 't talk to them . You will do nothing but report back to me . Ms Vickers , is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and to bring you here . Had you raised the monies yourself , Mr. Holloway we 'd happily be pursuing your agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . But if we can 't make contact why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer onboard . Cheers . So no response ? I 'm sorry , no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . How are your lessons going , David ? I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages ... to their roots . I 'm confident I can communicate with them provided your thesis is correct . " Provided it 's correct . " That 's good . That 's why they call it a thesis , doctor . What are you smiling about ? All right , Mr. Ravel , Mr. Chance , let 's take her down . - Roger that . - Yes , captain . Descent trajectory mapped . How we doing ? Great . All right , boss . All personnel this is the captain . Brace for entry . Yes , captain . That means you too , Vickers . All systems online . What is the atmosphere ? Atmosphere is 71 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen , traces of argon gas . Whoa , now , that 's weather . Just like home . Only if you 're breathing thru an exhaust pipe . CO2 is over 3 percent . Two minutes without a suit , you 're dead . Peak portside . Whoa , 52,000 ! It makes Everest look like a baby brother . All right , take us around . We 'll use that as our point of entry . Plain data rising up . We 've got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . No radio , no heat source . Nobody 's home . There is nothing in the desert and no man needs nothing . What was that ? Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots . Going through . Nice and slow . Keep it steady , boys . There . No , what are you doing ? Dr. Holloway , why don 't you take a seat ? Right there . God does not build in straight lines . Starboard side , this valley ! Captain , do you think you can put us down there ? Yeah , I wouldn 't be any good if I couldn 't do that . Mr. Ravel , starboard 90 degrees . - One mile , port bow . - One mile , port bow . Engage landing sequence . Switch to manual . - Commence landing . - Easy does it . - Roger that . - Yeah , baby , yeah . Bringing her down in five . - Preparing to fire RCS thrusters . - Four . Two . Easy does it . Generator systems are inactive . Temperature is at 2.724 K. Captain , would you please tell the survey team to suit up ... and meet us in the airlock . It 's only six hours left of daylight . - Why don 't you leave it for the morning ? - Oh nonono . It 's Christmas , captain , and I want to open my presents . You , boy . You 're coming with us . I 'd be delighted . Attention : Ramp will open in five minutes . Hey , Jackson what 's that for ? Expedition security . My job is to make sure everybody is nice and safe . This is a scientific expedition . No weapons . All right , then . Good luck with that . David , why are you wearing a suit , man ? I beg your pardon ? You don 't breathe , remember ? So why wear a suit ? I was designed like this ... because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind . If I didn 't wear the suit , it would defeat the purpose . Making you guys pretty close , huh ? Not too close , I hope . Attention : Ramp will open in 15 seconds . Ramp will open in five ... four , three , two , one . Hey . This is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? Come on ! You ready to do this ? I know you are . Hey , Fifield . I want a spectrograph on that structure . I want to know if it 's natural or if somebody put it there , alright ? I can 't tell you if it 's natural or not . But what I can tell you is , it 's hollow . Prometheus , are you seeing this ? Affirmative . We see it . You ready ? - Yeah . - Let 's do it . - After you . - After you . Okay . Careful . Prometheus , we 're going in . Copy that . What 's back here ? Some kind of a corridor ? Mr. Fifield , let 's get a grid of the structure . I want the whole interior . If there 's anything in here worth looking at these pups will find them . " Pups " ? Yeah , pups . My pups . Prometheus , we are now mapping . Copy that . Well , I 'll be damned . Fifield , you got a read ? Yeah . Pups are saying this way . Look at this . Oh , Charlie . Jesus . Sunlight is heating the water . Check out the humidity . Yeah , and look at the CO2 levels . Outside it 's completely toxic , and in ... in here there 's nothing . It 's breathable . What are you doing ? - Charlie . Don 't be an idiot . - Hey . Don 't be a skeptic . Right , there 's something generating an atmosphere . David ? - Dr. Holloway is correct . - Cleaner than Earth actually . They were terraforming here . - Please don 't do this ! - Look Ellie . Ellie , I 'm not wearing this thing anymore . Wish me luck , baby . Do you copy ? Do not remove your headgear . You crazy bastard . Prometheus , connect our suit cameras if you want to continue watching this freak show . We are taking our helmets off . Copy that . Switching feeds . Well , come on . Pay up . - Pay ? Pay what ? - What do you mean , " Pay what " ? Something is manufacturing breathable air down there . That , mate ... is terraforming . - No , no , no . The bet was why we came here . If you said a dead old man wanted to talk to Martians , then I 'd pay . Come on , a hundred credits . Put it towards a lap dance with Ms Vickers . How about that , eh ? It 's minus twelve in here . So why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it ain 't water . Maybe it 's Martian piss . That 's your ... scientific theory ? Is it ? Mr. Biology ? Whatever it is , it sure is collagenous . Some kind of sediment , perhaps . Impressive . What was that ? David ? David ? What is that ? David ? Ellie ! What the hell was that ? Aren 't we glad we didn 't bring any weapons ? - Come on , El . Let 's go . - Whose idea was that ? Keep up ! Come on ! Where did he go ? Wait , wait , wait . There it is . There it is . There it is . Oh , my god , Charlie . We found them . What do you mean " them " ? It is them , Ellie . Looks like a door ... and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch . They were right . What did you want them to be ? Wrong ? David ... please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . No , I 'm out of here . Hey , Fifield , where are you going ? What ? Look , I 'm just a geologist . I like rocks . I love rocks ! Now it 's clear you two don 't give a shit about rocks . But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead bodies . And I don 't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic dead body arena . I 'm gonna go back to the ship , if you don 't mind . Anyone wanna join me , huh ? You staying ? No , ship 's good . Yeah . Ship very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . Thank you . Pull yourself together , man . I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long 's it been dead ? Two thousand years , give or take . What are you doing , David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . Wait . We don 't know what 's on the other side . Oops . Sorry . Look , Ford . It 's the head . An amazing state of preservation . - We 'll take it in . - Yeah . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . Stop . Stop . Don 't touch it . Sorry . Please , don 't touch anything . Sweating . Organic . Oh , no . Charlie , the murals are changing . I think we 've affected the atmosphere in the room . Charlie , do you copy ? Oh , the head ! Ford , quick , help me bag the head ! - Boss . - What you got ? We got an incoming storm front . Silica and lots of static . This is not good . I see it . Ground crew this is Janek . I need you to hustle back right now . Ground crew , do you copy me ? I got 200-kilometer winds of airborne silica and enough static to fry your suit . Copy that , sir . But we need more time here . I 'll be closing the outer doors in 15 minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . Charlie ! David ! We must leave now . This is just another tomb . David ! - On three . - Two , three , up . Let 's go ! Easy , easy , easy . Careful . David , we are leaving ! Come on ! Damn it , they 've already taken off . Come on , let 's go . Prometheus to ground crew . You 're running out of time . I repeat ! You 're running out of time ! All right , come on . Let 's go . Go faster ! Charlie ! The head ! Ellie , no ! What are you doing ? Hatch closure , five seconds . Shit . Damn it , hold on ! Goddamn it . Door is closing . Ellie , don 't move ! Charlie ! Grab my hand ! Oh no ! No ! No , Ellie ! Ellie ! Got it . Decontamination at level three . So , what was that , Ellie ? Huh ? You could 've compromised the entire mission . Not to mention almost killing yourself ! Are you all right ? Yes . Thank you , David . My pleasure . All right Doctors , it 's real good to have you back , but where 's Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? - Get them up for me . - All right . We 've been here before , Fifield . I don 't know . It all looks the same to me . Boys , this is the captain . Listen up . Between the static electricity and the wind speed ... well , there ain 't no safe way to come get you . What ? Now , temperature is dropping rapidly , so get your helmets on and stay warm . Until the storm passes . Captain ... can you get a message to the scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his ? Mhmm . You got a pen nearby ? No . No , I think we got it . Tell them I said ... themselves . Copy ? Copy that . All right , boys , keep your head down and we 'll come get you in the morning . Well , which way now , huh ? All right . Well , which way , huh ? Okay . Sample is sterile . No contagion present . David . So are they all dead ? What ? Who ? Your Engineers . Are they all dead or aren 't they ? I don 't know . We just got here . Scan . Do you even care if they 're all dead ? Weyland cared . Dr. Shaw . Have a look at this . - That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . I think it 's a helmet . - Let 's see if we can lift it up . - Yeah . We should be able to pry this open . It 's too heavy for us . David ? Careful . Like so . What is that on its head ? It looks like new cells . - In a state of ... - Change . Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stem line into the locus coeruleus ? I think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it 's still alive . - Thirty amps . - Okay . No more . Let me make an incision . Okay . Go up , 40 . Okay , 40 up . Did you see that ? - Yes . - Yep . See ? Go up another 10 . Okay , up 10 . Maybe it 's a little bit too ... too much ... - Go down 10 . - Okay . Down 10 . Down another 20 . Okay , I 'm trying this up . - I 'm trying , it 's not going down . - Full down . Ford ... stop it . Oh , god . David , contain it ! Now ! - Contain it ? Turn it off ! Now ! - Oh , god . The smell ! Oh , god , look at that . Look at that . It 's getting worse . Mortal , after all . Ford , take a sample . Let 's have a look . No , sir , I will take care of it . Yes , sir , understood . I 'm sorry . Fortunately , slightly premature . Of course , sir . Ms Vickers . What did he say , David ? I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . What did he say ? I 'm sorry that 's confidential . So help me god ... I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it . What did he say ? He said : " Try harder . " Cup of tea , ma 'am ? Genetic view . Okay . Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Okay . Compare it to the gene sample ? Yeah . Overlay . Processing . Processing . DNA match . Oh , my god . It 's us . It 's everything . What killed them ? Big things have small beginnings . Am I interrupting ? I thought you might be running low . Pour yourself a glass , pal . Thank you , but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . Oh . Right , I almost forgot you 're not a real boy , huh . I 'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone Dr. Holloway . You think we wasted our time coming here , don 't you ? Your question depends on the understanding what you hoped to achieve by coming here . What we hoped to achieve was to meet our makers . To get answers . Why they ... why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? We made you because we could . Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing from your creator ? I guess it 's a good thing you can 't be disappointed , huh ? Yes . It 's wonderful actually . May I ask you something ? Please do . How far would you go ... to get what you came all this way for ? Your answers . What would you be willing to do ? Anything and everything . That 's worth drinking to I 'd imagine . Here 's mud in your eye , pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course they 're real . Jesus Christ . I mean ... Look at the pile . Look how high up they are . It looks like they were running from something . Okay . Don 't touch , okay ? Man , this thing is opened up from the inside . Almost like it exploded . Looks like a scene out some sort of holocaust painting , you know ? Well ... So , whatever killed them is long gone , right ? Millburn , Fifield . This is Prometheus . What is your position ? Prometheus , this is Millburn . We are at 7-4-0-1-4-7-7 . Why ? Just got a ping about one click west of you . What do you mean " a ping " ? Well , whatever that probe is picking up ... it 's not dead . It 's reading a life form . What ... ? Okay , what do you mean , " a life form " ? Is it ... ? Is it moving ? No , I don 't think so . No , uh , captain , you 're uh ... obviously not seeing ... what we 're seeing down here , but if you were , you wouldn 't be talking about a bloody ping ! Eh ? I know , boys . Your signal has been coming in sporadically since the storm hit . That 's no good to us down here , Captain ! Is it ... ? Is it moving ? Are these things moving ? No . No , it just disappeared , actually . Must be a glitch . What do you mean , " a glitch " ? All right , boys . Sleep tight . Try not to bugger each other . Captain , what do you mean , " a glitch " ? Millburn , what does he mean ? Wait . Now , he said ... - He said one click west , yeah ? - Yeah . Now , we ... We don 't want to check that out , do we ? Shit , no . Where are we gonna go ? East . Yeah , east . A glitch , man . " Pings , glitch , life form . " What the fuck ? Based on the behavior of the subject in these holographic recordings ... we 're still attempting to identify what caused the head to combust . I can 't help but wonder ... was there an outbreak here ? You rang ... ma 'am ? I have something important to tell you . What is that ? This is a rose that I had frozen with the champagne . I was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for . We did find what we came for . They were here . This is ... The most significant discovery in the history of mankind . Oh , I know . It 's incredible , it really is . But I wanted to talk to them . I mean , don 't you want to know why they came ? Why they abandoned us ? I just want answers , baby . We were right , Charlie . I have proof . Look . Their genetic material predates ours . We come from them . - You 're kidding me . - No . Okay . Okay . Okay . I guess you can take your father 's cross off now . Why would I want to do that ? Because they made us . And who made them ? Well , exactly . We 'll never know . But here 's what we do know : That there is nothing special about the creation of life . Right ? Anybody can do it . I mean , all you need is a dash of DNA and half a brain , right ? I can 't . I can 't create life . What does that say about me ? Ellie , that 's not ... I didn 't mean ... - I wasn 't talking about ... - Children ? Us . Hey , hey , hey . Hey . Elizabeth Shaw ... you are the most special person I have ever met in my life ... and I love you . Hey . Oh . How much longer is this gonna take ? I don 't know . I 'm just a captain . That thing sounds like a dying cat , by the way . I 'll have you know that this thing ... once belonged to Stephen Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? You know ... if you wanna get laid ... you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scan . I mean you could just say , " Hey , I 'm trying to get laid . " I could . I could say that , right ? But then it wouldn 't make sense ... why I would fly myself half a billion miles from every man on Earth ... if I wanted to get laid , would it ? Hey , uh ... Vickers . Hey Vickers . I was wondering ... Are you a robot ? My room . Ten minutes . Well , if you can 't be with the one you love Love the one you 're with . Love the one you 're with . Millburn . What 's all this black stuff ? Gazpacho . Is that tobacco ? Is that tobacco in your respirator ? Yeah , sure . Tobacco . On behalf of scientists everywhere , I am ashamed to count you amongst us Fifield . Really . - Hey , Millburn . - Yeah ? You see this thing ? What do you think this thing was ? Some kind of a god ? Something they worshiped ? What ? - I don 't know . It kind of looks like ... - What 's that ? - What the hell is that ? - Whoa ! Okay . - Okay . Just stay calm . Stay quiet . - Oh my god . This is okay , I can handle this . Hey , baby . Hey . Come in , Prometheus . We have an elongate reptile-type creature . Maybe 30 , 40 inches , with transparent skin . And it 's beautiful . Okay ! Prometheus we have two . Look at you . Look at you , baby . Jesus , look at the size of that . What is it ? - You need to stay calm . OK ? - What 's there to be calm about ? You need to stay calm please , she is beautiful . She ? What the hell makes you think that 's female ? Because she has s a lady look . Hey . She 's mesmerized . Come here . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Hey , baby . You 're strong ! Maybe you should help me now ! OK ! Get it off , man ! OK ! Cut it here , man ! I ain 't touching that ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god . - It 's getting tighter . - I ain 't touching it ! Touch the thing , man , for god 's sake ! God , you 're making it worse ! It 's tightening ! It 's tight ... It 's breaking my arm ! Shit ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Shit ! Oh , my god ! Oh , Jesus ! It 's in my suit . It 's in my suit . Jesus Christ . Shaw , you up ? Yeah , what 's up ? All right . The storm 's passed , but can 't reach Millburn or Fifield on the com . Taking a few men down , see if I can rustle them up . Okay . Any idea where they are ? Last time they radioed in , they were just outside where you found your head . Okay , we 're coming . All right . Chance , you 're coming with me . Come on . All right , boss . - Ravel , did you fix that glitch ? - No , captain . - It 's gotta be in the hardware . - What glitch , captain ? One of their probes picked up a life form . Pops up every hour and so for a couple of seconds and then it 's gone . I can find the probe and fix it for you , if you like . Knock yourself out . Be careful , doctors . Fifield ! Millburn ? All right , come on down . David , are you alone ? Yes , Ms Vickers . Uplink your feed to my room . Copy . You son of a bitch . You cut me off . What is this ? - Charlie ? - I just tripped . Oh , my god , you 're sick ! I 'm okay , baby . Come on . Fifield ? Millburn ? Hey , Chance . I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . Dr. Shaw ? Yeah ? Do we have any idea what is oozing out of these vases ? No . They weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ? What ? Who is it ? Which one ? - Who is it ? - It 's Millburn . - Ellie . - Don 't touch him . Hold on . Ellie , honey . Charlie , what 's wrong ? Hey , I need you to look at me , okay ? You know infections so , what do you see ? This is not good , baby . You look at me , you tell me what you see . Oh , my god . Ford , get over here . - It 's okay . - Not the way you ... Janek ? - What ? - We have to go now ! What do you see ? - We got a man down here , Shaw ! - Honey , what do you see ? Huh ? Holloway 's sick . He 's not good . I see a movement in his esophagus . - Come on , baby . - No . I 'm okay . Janek ! Come over and help me ! - Hey , I 'm okay . - Ford , get over there . - What 's happening over there ? - Easy . - I 'm okay . - Let 's go ! Help me with him . I got you . We 're gonna get you out of here . Prometheus come in . - Watch your head . - I 'm okay . I 'm okay . - Holloway ! - Get him up . - Come on . - Prometheus , come in . Is anyone there ? This is Vickers . I need a medical team standing by the airlock . - Full quarantine fail-safe . - Come on people ! Holloway 's sick . Sick with what ? - Just do it . - Let 's get him back to the ship . - It 's not safe down here . - Charlie ? I 'm suiting up . - Charlie , talk to me . - Move ! - What was that thing back there ? - Let 's go , let ! s go people ! We 've gotta move ! We 've gotta move ! Ellie ! He don 't look too good . Did he catch something down there ? We had our helmets off . I don 't know . Prometheus , this is Janek . Make sure that back door is open . Aye , captain . Oh , god . I 'm so sorry . Come on ! Please ! Prometheus ! Why is that door not open ? Vickers , that is an order ! Get that goddamn door open ! - Look at me . It 's too late , I 'm sick . - No , it 's not . Come on ! Ford , help me ! Airlock Crew , if can hear me , this is Janek . Open that back door right now ! Hold that door ! Prometheus ... do you copy ? Goddamn it , open that door ! That is an order ! Open it . What the hell is this ? He 's not coming onboard . - Baby , come on . - Vickers , this is a sick man . I can see that , that 's why he 's not coming on my ship ! Charlie ! Chance , get over here ! Please ! We can still help him ! Help yourself . Everybody but Holloway back on this ship , now ! I won 't leave him ! Then stay ! What a minute ! We can contain him ! Put him on the medpod ! Please don 't do this . It 's okay , Ellie . Vickers ! What are you doing ? I love you , baby . - I love you . - No . I 'm telling you , stay back ! Do it . Stay back ! No ! No , Charlie ! - Do it . - No ! No ! Charlie ! No ! My deepest condolences . I 'm going to have to take this . It may be contaminated . If there 's a contagion , we were all exposed . You need ... We need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . Yes , of course . Yes ? I understand how ... inappropriate this is ... given the circumstances . But as you ordered quarantine fail-safes ... it 's my responsibility to ask . Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? Since you and he were so ... close . I just want to be as thorough as poss ... My , my . You 're pregnant . What ? From the look of it , three months so . No , that 's impossible . I can 't be pregnant . Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? Yes ... but 10 hours ago . There 's no bloody way I 'm three months pregnant . Well , doctor ... it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . I want to see it . Don 't think that 's a good idea . David , I want to see it . Now , doctor ... I want to see it . I want it out of me . I 'm afraid we don 't have the personnel ... to perform a procedure like that . - Our best option ... - I want it out . Put you back into cryostasis until we return to Earth . Please , get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please . It must be very painful . Here , let me give you something . That 's it . There , there . Someone will be along shortly ... to bring you back to Cryo Deck . It must feel like your god abandoned you . What ? To lose Dr. Holloway after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do you ... ? How do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Dr. Shaw ? We 're here to put you in an anti-contamination suit , take you back to Cryo Deck ... go to beddy-byes . Dr. Shaw ? She 's totally doped . Prepare her . Emergency procedures initiated .

Bridge , uh ... to hangar . This is the captain . - Yes , captain . - Can you see what I 'm seeing ? Fifield 's monitor just popped up . What ? Where ? According to what I 'm looking at , it 's right outside the goddamn ship . Barnes , open the door ! Fifield , do you copy me ? Come on in . Fifield ? Wait a second . Hey , Wallace . Take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? I 'm coming down . Chance , you 're suiting up . - Come on . - Don 't let it on the ship ! Take him out ! Got him ! Do it ! - You ready , Chance ? - Yes . Come on ! Get in the rover ! We gotta get out of here ! Go ! What is that ? You 've been asleep . You were on the ship all this time . Why ? Well , I ... I have a few days of life left in me . I didn 't wanna waste them until I was sure that you could deliver what you promised . To meet my maker . There we are , sir . Nice and clean . Haven 't you told him they 're all gone ? But they 're not all gone , Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? Turn me around . You convinced me that ... if these things made us ... then surely they could save us . My stick , please . Well , save me , anyway . Save you from what ? Death , of course . Stand me up . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Yes , sir . But you don 't understand . You don 't know . This place isn 't what we thought it was . They aren 't what we thought they were . I was wrong . We were so wrong . Charlie ... Dr. Holloway 's dead . We must leave ! And what would Charlie do ... now that we 're so close ... to answering the most meaningful questions ... ever asked by mankind ? How can you leave without ... knowing what they are ? Or have you lost your faith , Shaw ? Okay . Okay . Come in . Where the hell are you going , doc ? You know what this place is ? Those Engineers ? This ain 't their home . It 's an installation . Maybe even military . They put it out here in the middle of nowhere because they 're not stupid enough to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit is in those vases . They made it here . It got out , it turned on them . The end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you want to know what they have to say ? I don 't care . Right . All you do is fly the ship . That 's right . But you must care about something , captain . If you didn 't , why are you here ? How about this ? No matter what happens down there ... I can 't bring none of that shit back home with us . Can 't let it happen . And I 'll do whatever I have to , to see that it doesn 't . Make sure you do , captain . So you came after all . I thought you wanted me to . After all your vigorous attempts to stop me from coming here I 'm just surprise to see you . It 's all right David . Leave us . Yes , sir . If you 're really going down there , you 're going to die . Very negative way of looking at things . Exactly why you should have stayed at home . Did you really think I was gonna sit in a boardroom for years arguing over who was in charge while you go look for some miracle on some godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? A king has his reign , and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That ... is the natural order of things . Anything else ? No ... Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . Sorry . Poor choice of words . Extraordinary survival instincts , Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland is not around to program you anymore ? I suppose I 'll be free . You want that ? " Want " ? Not a concept I 'm familiar with . That being said ... doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . Dr. Shaw . So pleased you could join us . You can take your helmet off if you like , sir . What ? The air is perfectly breathable . Are you sure ? Positive . Wait . We still don 't know how Holloway got infected . If it 's in the air . It 's not . How do you know that ? Smells fine to me . - Shall we ? - Please . The bridge is just up ahead . What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . Janek ? Are you seeing this ? How many is there , Shaw ? Thousands . What the hell ? Ravel , give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . Strip away the dome . Isolate that area , bring it up . Bringing it up , captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . A superior species , no doubt . Their hypersleep chambers ... will impress , I trust . So they were traveling somewhere . I 've managed to work out the broad strokes . It 's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving ... before things went to pot . Leaving to go where ? Earth . Why ? Sometimes to create one must first destroy . Where is he , David ? This way , sir . Are you sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . And you can speak to him ? I believe I can . I 'm all right , I 'm all right . Speak to him , David . Tell him we came , just like he asked . Ask him where they are from . What are you doing ? Ask him what 's in his cargo . It killed his people . Shaw , enough . - David . - You made it here ... and it was meant for us . Why ? Shaw . Enough . For god 's sake , shut her up . I need to know why ! What did we do wrong ? Why do you hate us ? If she opens her mouth again , shoot her . David , continue . Tell him why I came . No ! Ford ! Run ! There 's nothing . I know . Have a good journey , Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . Mr. Chance , take us home . Hey , Captain . What the hell was that ? Prometheus ! Come in ! Shaw , is that you ? Copy . Janek listen to me . This ship is taking off ! - What ? - What the hell is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! We 're not stopping anything , Shaw . We 're going home . Janek , if you don 't stop it there won 't be any home to go back to . It 's .. It 's carrying death , and it 's headed for Earth . - Shaw , this is not a warship . - I know . Let 's go . I know that . But you must do it . Captain , let 's go ! Janek , please believe me ! Please ! I told you to get this ship going . Mr. Ravel . Warm up the ion propulsion . - What the hell are you talking about ? - Sir . Burning the ion in the inner atmosphere ... Turns us into a bullet . That 's exactly the point . What the hell are you doing ? Janek this is my ship . I 'm telling you to take us home ! Vickers , I 'm gonna eject your life support module into that surface . That 's two years of life . You want it , or you want to stay with me ? You got 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . You 're crazy . Gentlemen . I can handle this myself . Feel free to join Ms Vickers . All due respect , captain . You 're a shit pilot and you 're gonna need all the help you can get . Well , if you can 't be with the one you love If you think this means the bet 's off ... you 're wrong . Why don 't you pay me on the other side ? All right , get us as close as we can . Only got one shot at this . Lifeboats away ! Twenty seconds to evacuate . - Countdown initiated . - Ion propulsion is online . Ten . Nine . Come on ! Eight . - Three . - Alright , gentlemen . Let 's do it ! Two . Impact imminent . Hands off ! Oh , god . No . No . No ! No ! No ! Oh , god . Warning : You have two minutes of oxygen remaining . Warning : You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining . Airlock sealed . Oxygen levels now stabilizing . Elizabeth , are you there ? This is David . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . You need to get out immediately . He 's coming for you . Who 's coming ? Airlock breach . Die ! I 'm so sorry . Oh , god . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Charlie , I can 't do it . I can 't do it anymore . Elizabeth . Are you there ? Dr. Shaw ... can you hear me ? Yes . Yes , I can hear you . I was afraid you were dead . You have no idea what afraid is . I know we 've had our differences ... but , please ... I need to ask you for your help . Why the hell would I help you ? Because , without me , you 'll never leave this place . Neither one of us is leaving this place . It 's not the only ship . There are many others . I can operate them . Dr. Shaw ? Dr. Shaw ! Over here . Where is my cross ? The pouch in my utility belt . Even after all this you still believe , don 't you ? You said you could understand their navigation use their maps . Yes , of course . Once we get to one of their other ships finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward . I don 't want to go back to where we came from . I want to go where they came from . Do you think you can do that , David ? Yes . I believe I can . May I ask what you hope to achieve by going there ? They created us . Then they tried to kill us . They changed their minds . I deserve to know why . The answer is irrelevant . Does it matter why they changed their minds ? Yes . Yes , it does . I don 't understand . Well . I guess that 's because I 'm a human being and you 're a robot . I 'm sorry . It 's quite all right . Final report of the vessel Prometheus . The ship and her entire crew are gone . If you 're receiving this transmission make no attempt to come to its point of origin . There is only death here now , and I 'm leaving it behind . It is New Year 's Day the year of our Lord , 2094 . My name is Elizabeth Shaw the last survivor of the Prometheus . And I am still searching .

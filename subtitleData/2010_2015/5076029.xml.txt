 VANESSA : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You came into my house and stole from me , and I will respond in kind . Gone ! Someone is undoing my life 's work ! ARTIE : They 're all here . ( SIGHS ) Artie ? I 'm not sure this is everything . Those are shipping supplies . Ow ! God , what now ? Yeah , we gotta get you off that Metronome . I don 't know if it 's possible . You , sir , owe me a dinner . A very nice dinner . Steve ! How is the research coming ? STEVE : ( SIGHS ) I 'm only halfway through the A 's . Do you have any idea how huge the Warehouse database is ? No . Tell me . You could have just said , " Stupid question . " Stupid question . Well , you know who could help you , though ? Tech-savvy girl . Maybe with a bit of punk rock flair , and a bit of goth . Artie , if Claudia finds out that I 'm looking to disconnect myself from the Metronome , she 'll just try and stop me , because it 's dangerous . Oh , yes , of course . Yeah . She 'd probably find a way to blame me , too . Hey , look at me . When 's the last time you slept ? Right after I died . Well , how am I supposed to sleep ? As long as Claudia feels any pain that I do , I 'm gonna be a little stressed out . It 's not fair that she 's being punished for saving my life . Artifacts are not fair . All right , off I go . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'll dive right into this with you as soon as I am back , and we will find something . All right ? Okay . ( DOOR OPENS ) Artie-o , Artie-o . Wherefore art thou , Artie-o ? But soft , what light through yon umbilicus breaks ? It is the east , and Dr. Vaness-iet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon ... Kill ? Yeah , there 's a thought . Hey , is this new ? No . Oh , come on . I think it 's so cute you officially have a girlfriend . She 's not my girlfriend . Are you seeing anyone else ? No . Do you want to ? No . She 's your girlfriend . BOTH : Ooh ! ( BARKS ) I haven 't had a girlfriend since Nixon left office . Oh , well , get thee hence . Go forth and procreate . Oh , yes , that 's what we want , children . ( CLAUDIA CHUCKLES ) Wait ! Where are Pete and Myka ? I gave them an assignment . What assignment ? We 've been ping-less for 48 hours . It 's a Warehouse record . Where are they ? What are you keeping from me ? Spill . Oh , Lord , why in your wisdom did you send me such a noodge ? Karma . That is new , isn 't it ? No ! ( TREY WHINES ) ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) Oh ! You found it ! Is it the right one ? Make , model and year , as requested . Oh , yeah , I don 't even want to know what kind ofjingle bells kinks you two kids are into . Hey , hey , hey , hey . It 's a gift ... ( DING ) Not an artifact . And furthermore , show of hands . Who here , in this room , is not single ? I rest my case . So you do have a girlfriend . ALL : Ooh ! ( TREY BARKS ) A little advice . Things have been going rather well , and I 've been considering asking Vanessa for a more ... Geographical commitment . You mean , like , move in together ? ( TREY WHINES ) STEVE : Here ? Or in Univille , the Paris of the badlands ? Who wouldn 't want to live there ? Hmm , good point . Yes , perhaps a pied-a-terre in Featherhead is more the ticket . It 's just I don 't know if the timing is right . I think it 's a great idea , Artie . You do ? Yeah . Thank you . Is this new ? Yes . It 's lovely . ARTIE : Thanks . Speaking of timing , I 'm late . All right , if you need me for any reason whatsoever , you call me , only if it 's important . PETE : Artie , would you just relax , okay ? We 're old pros . Yeah , go . Have a great weekend . Yes , I ... I intend to . I 'll try . Don 't be yourself . ( TREY BARKS ) KRISTEN : $ 300 . Not bad for an impromptu clothing drive . Thanks to you , Kristen . All I did was tweet about it . You 're too modest . Oh , that reminds me , Father , uh , Mrs. Thompson was looking for pieces for a bedroom set . Someone just donated a dressing mirror , I think . I remember the package . I 'll go . ( BULB POPS ) Oh ! ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , she 'll love it . " Click me . " Oh , goodness ! Oh ... ( GIRL 'S GIGGLE ECHOES ) Hello ? ( GIRL 'S GIGGLE ECHOES ) Is someone there ? ALICE : Help me . Please , help me ! Hello ? ( THUDDING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( GIRL 'S GIGGLE ECHOES ) Kristen ? Are you okay ? ( GIGGLES ) Tell me , Father ... Where can I find L 'Etoile ? What ? What ? What ? I ... I don 't know ... You don 't know . I don 't know ... what ? L 'Etoile . I don 't know what ... Well , maybe this will jog your memory . ( MOANING ) Damn , they 'll be here soon . I mustn 't be late . L 'Etoile . Where is it ? Kristen . Kristen ! What the devil has gotten into you ? ( GIGGLES ) Not the devil . ( GASPS ) ( GIGGLES ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) MAN : Look out ! ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( LAUGHS ) ( HORN HONKS , TIRES SCREECH ) Oh , show some skin , Kristen . ( GIGGLES ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( CRASHING ) ( KRISTEN SCREAMING ) Let me out of here , you bastards ! She 's such a sweet young lady . I 've never seen her like that . It 's like she 's possessed . Yeah , well , she does kind of have that whole Linda Blair head-spinning thing going on there . What 's wrong with her ? MYKA : Father , has Kristen come into contact with any old or unusual objects lately ? We work in a thrift store . I will kill every one of you ! She doesn 't mean that . Well , this should be a fun interview . Hi . Hello , Kristen . I 'm , uh ... Myka Bering . And Pete Lattimer . ( PURRS ) Possession and telepathy . An artifact two-fer . Terrific . Kristen , we think that you may have come into contact with something that 's altered you . When , exactly , did you ... You should wear tighter clothes , Pete . You 're lookin ' hot ! Really ? Because I do 1,000 crunches , and I 'm just , like , oh ... Pete ! Do you remember touching something that perhaps you shouldn 't have ... Have touched ? I know what I 'd like to touch . ( KNUCKLES CRACK ) ( YELLS ) You almost broke my finger , you psycho ! ( DISTORTED VOICE ) Take an ax and hack it to bits . ( SIGHS ) Okay . ( GIGGLES ) We are not going to get anything out of her . ( KRISTEN GIGGLING ) Let 's , uh ... Let 's go check out that thrift store . Yeah . Smile all you want . Linda Blair 's career was never the same . ( SIGHS ) All right ... ( BREATHES , SNIFFS ) ( ZIPS UP ZIPPER ) Ah . Once more into the breach . Wow . Just the reaction I was hoping for . Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Yeah . So I need just one more minute . Relax . Make yourself comfortable . And I like that jacket . What , this old thing ? Did you find someplace interesting ? Only the finest , most romantic restaurant in town . Granted , we don 't set the bar very high around here . Well , it 's the company that matters . I couldn 't ask for better . Whoa . ( CHUCKLES ) Shall we ? Oh , yes . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Not gonna let it go , are you ? Oh , you know me so well . You know , you and I could have totally solved the case of church girl gone wild , but no ... Jinksy had to be all , " You know ... You know what ? " I think we should let Pete and Myka handle this one . " That is absolutely me . Do Nicholson ! Oh , come on , you used to love action and adventure . Remember ? Bad guys and guns ! What are you hiding ? I 'm not hiding . Look , we 've been through a lot . I think that we should just take it easy for a while . Both of us . Really ? Who died and made you boss of me ? Uh , I did . Well , what , are you afraid of dying again ? You know you can 't die , right ? That 's not what I 'm afraid of , Claud . Trust me . ( SPRAYING ) Anything sparking ? No . You know , unfortunately , my mother would love this place . Ew . You ? Nope . I mean , look , we could be here all night . Maybe not . Pete ? Spooky . PETE : Blood . Blood , blood . Blood . Blood , blood , blood . Hmm . Well , if you say so . Ah ! " Click me , " huh ? Click you ! Pete this is , this is mirror glass . ( SIGHS ) What ? Would you help me with this for a second ? Okay . ( PETE STRAINING ) ( MYKA GASPS ) It 's funny , this almost looks like ... It is . Oh , my God , the mirror ! ( SCREAMS ) No , we ... We locked this in the Dark Vault years ago . Aw , come on , man ! What , artifacts can walk now ? Pete , do you remember the rule of the mirror ? Yeah , uh , nothing comes out unless something goes in . Oh , snap , that wasn 't Kristen at the hospital ! It was Alice Liddell . She 's free , again . Hi , handsome . You from around here ? ( CHUCKLES ) Born and raised . Ooh . Then you must know where I can find L 'Etoile . Yeah , sure . It 's over at 6th and State . It 's a short drive from here . ( CHUCKLES ) 6th and State . Ooh ... ( SIGHS ) My hand is numb . Is that okay ? ( STAMMERING ) It might be too tight . The strap . Is it , um ... Is it tingling ? It was , and now I can 't feel anything at all . Well ... Eleanor does have a tendency to go a little too tight with these . Crazy woman thinks she runs this place half the time . ( MOANS ) Feels so good . Mmm ... ( CHUCKLES ) ( GRUNTS ) ( DISTORTED VOICE ) We 're all mad here . Shh . 6th and State . All Alice ever wanted was to be free of the Warehouse . It looks like the little lunatic got her wish . She gets out of here , she 's gonna run . We could lose her forever . Hey , where is she ? Where 's the girl ? She 's dangerous . I know . Dude ! She smashed my face and took off . Secret Service . I need you to shut down this hospital now . No one gets in or out , you got me ? Yeah , but ... Just go ! Why don 't women like me ? Pete , we just need to get inside her head . You know , figure out her next move . I 'm not sure " psychopathic nut job " is in my wheelhouse . Deep down , she 's still a little girl . We just need to think like a child . Okay , now , that 's in my wheelhouse . If I 'd just escaped from my magic mirror prison , I 'd want to get as far away from the two of us as possible . Where would I go ? MYKA : Pete . I really need to start looking down . Pete , she went this way . Alice , hands where we can see ' em ! ( GASPS ) Alice ? Who 's Alice ? Knock it off , Wonderland . We know you 're in there . Who are you people ? Where 's Father Mitchell ? Is this a hospital ? Pete , Alice wouldn 't know who Father Mitchell is . Okay , all right . Come on . There you go . What 's the last thing you remember ? I was in the stockroom unwrapping this mirror that came in , and then , a bright flash of light . And then ... Nothing . Yeah . Like the whole world just disappeared , and all that was left was cold and darkness and ... And silence . Yeah . It was horrible . I never felt so alone . It 's okay . PETE : What was that ? Pete , that 's exactly how I felt when I was trapped in Lewis Carroll 's mirror . That 's not Alice . Then where is she ? If I had to guess ... She 's inside someone else . Wait , wait , somebody else ? Do you think she 's figured out how to jump bodies ? I don 't know , but if she has , I mean , she could be anyone . Hey , where 's my ambulance ? ( SIREN BLARING ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) And she 's mobile . I tracked her heading due south a few miles from your location . Uploading the coordinates to the Highlander 's GPS now . Wherever that ambulance goes , you 'll be able to find it . Awesome . Thanks , Claud . MYKA : The mirror 's destroyed , so you guys need to find something to extract and contain Alice . STEVE : Aye , Captain . Spock and Uhura out . Thanks . I like it when I get to be Spock . Oh , you 're hilarious . Okay , now , I really want to understand this . Alice In Wonderland is actually a real account of a homicidal maniac trapped in a mirror that we have in the Warehouse ? Had . Which is totally freaky . That thing was locked down tight . Okay , two jobs . One , find a containment artifact for Alice , and two , figure out how that mirror got out . Paging Leena . Please retrieve the Dodgson file and meet your party in the Dark Vault . ( CLATTERING ) I made that . Sylvia Plath 's typewriter can suck the life out of a person . Don 't get too close . Yeah , that 'll slow her down , but it won 't draw her out . Maybe her escape had something to do with the properties of the mirror ? Could she have found a way out on her own ? You said she 's pretty resourceful . Doubtful . It 's more likely the mirror got out first , not Alice . Somebody set her free . Hello . That 's the same thing Artie and I saw the other day . Please to ' splain . You 've seen one of these before ? There was a box of black diamonds at the storage space . What storage space ? Where the artifacts were stored . What are you talking about ? Artie said he was gonna tell you . Tell me what ? That someone 's been stealing artifacts from the Warehouse and sending them out into the world . Okay . So many questions . Well , uh , he wouldn 't say much , but he seemed to know who it was , and it 's clearly someone with a serious beef against him . All right , I 'm gonna have to check the security feeds . So these are what , the Pink Panther 's calling card ? Where is Lewis Carroll 's mirror ? Gone . Broken . And Alice is loose in Rapid City . So we 're looking for a new and hopefully permanent home for little Miss Cray-Cray . Liang-569 . The traps section . Oh , my God . ( WOMAN 'S VOICE CACKLING ) Bupkis up front . The tire 's warm . Okay , the crash must 've just happened . She can 't have gotten far . Not without new wheels . There 's nothing . Pete , over there . Bloody hell ! Let 's go . Alice ! Hey ! ( LAUGHING CRAZILY ) Who the hell are you ? I 'm you . ( LAUGHS ) That 's how she 's been body jumping . ( TIRES SCREECH ) She 's got a piece of the mirror . Love to stay and play . ( DISTORTED VOICE ) But I have a very important date . ( TIRES SCREECH ) All right , you put out the flames , I 'll turn off the gas . Okay . So you still think she 's a little girl ? I think it 's time we called Artie . Yeah . They should be done with dessert . Okay , it was a ... Yeah . It was a bicycle that my father gave me for my seventh birthday . And it was all , like , pinky and shiny . And it had this cute little basket on the back of it . And it had tassels hanging from the handlebars . And the only thing it was missing ... Was a shiny copper bell ? I 've told you this story . Okay , well , that happens sometimes at this age . Mmm-hmm . Your name 's Artie , right ? How ... How do I know you ? I could hear you tell that story 1,000 times just to see that look in your eyes when you tell it . Vanessa ... I 've been thinking . We have these little rendezvous once a month ... And maybe we should do it more ? I 'd like that . You would ? I have something for you . It 's okay . It 's nothing fancy . It 's just something that I 'm absolutely positive you don 't have . Ooh . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Sorry . All right , Pete , this better be so important . Alice Liddell is loose . Alice . Where ? Rapid City , South Dakota . Why is she in Rapid City ? Because that 's where L 'Etoile is , uh , I guess . L 'Etoile ? The EMT that Alice body-jacked said she was in a hurry to get to something called L 'Etoile . And Myka says it means " star " in French . Yeah . It 's also a restaurant . Compliments of the house . We happen to be at L 'Etoile right now . I think you should absolutely join us . It 's got the best tiramisu in all of South Dakota . Hurry , before it 's 86'd . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS OFF ) Artie ? Uh , you know , nature calls . I understand . So sorry . Somebody look after that poor girl ! Come on . Where are the people from this table ? Where , damn it ? Where , damn it ? ( PATRONS GASP ) ( FIRE ALARM BELL RINGING ) ( ALARMED MURMURS ) Yeah , this has Alice written all over it . ( POLICE SIREN CHIRPS ) MYKA : Yeah , we should check with Artie . Artie , where are you ? ARTIE : No , uh , turn around . Pete . Yeah . Over here . Hey . So where 's Alice ? Alice , well , inside our waitress . Yeah , probably not anymore . She 's got a new trick up her sleeve . Girlfriend can body jump . Oh , great . What does she want ? What is she doing here ? Yeah , and how did she get out of the Warehouse ? Yeah , let 's not worry about that now . Let 's just focus on what is she doing here , and what does she want ? Well , we thought it was about her finally being free of the mirror , but it doesn 't look like she 's on the run . She 's hunting something , or someone . Me . She 's hunting me . LEENA : Looks like somebody 's behind on inventory in this section . I figured I 'd get to it sometime before my 40th birthday . Save the date . What exactly are we looking for ? This . Right , okay . So the Warehouse agent who wrote Alice In Wonderland incorporated artifacts into the narrative . Like , the Mad Hatter is based on King George III 's crown , which causes madness . And the stoner caterpillar ? It says , " Based on Hakim Abul Fateh Gilani , " 16th century physician whose hookah could draw " a person 's spirit out of their body and trap it . " Sounds perfect . Now , where is it ? Hey , you guys look here . I 'll check the next aisle . ( EXHALES ) Spartacus 's retarius . Rube Goldberg 's wire collection . Ebenezer Thorndike 's lobster trap . Hey , is that it ? Where , up at the top ? Yes . Ugh , come to mamacita . Uh , Claud , be careful . None of that stuff looks like it 's nailed down . Oh , have a little faith . If I get to the top of this thing , I 'm naming it Mount Donovan . ( CHUCKLES ) ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLING ) ( GRUNTING ) Ow ! What the hell was that ? Claud , are you okay ? Yeah . Yep , all good , Jinksy . You 're absolutely sure ? No , no , I 'm fine . Do you feel any pain ? God , yes ! It was just a quick ... Wait . Did Artie tell you about my phantom pains ? Yeah . Yeah . Ugh , that 's why you 're being so soft and squishy today . Are you protecting me ? Yeah , yeah . Oh , silly wabbit . Girl wonders can 't be killed . Steve ? Yeah ? What 's going on between you and Claudia ? What ? Nothing . Your auras just swapped back and forth . No , they didn 't . I know what I saw . And I have only ever seen that once before , and it didn 't end well . All right , saddle up , Jinksy . We 'll talk about this later . Let 's go smoke us out a psychopath . Takes one to find one . Be careful . Okay , Claudia and Steve are on the way with the Fateh Gilani Hookah . And now we have to find Alice . She could be inside any of these people . She 's probably still here , watching us . I mean , watching you . All right , look , while you two play Where 's Wacko , Mykes , do you still have those sunglasses with the mirrors ? What ? ARTIE : Yeah , no , no . That 's excellent . She 'll show up in the reflection . Oh , look at you , having ideas . I have ideas ... Most of them are illegal . It 's so much more exciting out here in the field , you know ? Yeah . Well , on this date I was hoping for an entirely different kind of excitement . Hey . Hey . PETE : No . No ? Excuse me , Sparky . PETE : No . No . No ? Hello . MYKA : Ladies ? Hi . Hi . Uh , let 's see . No . You know , maybe we could , I don 't know , do dinner later , or ... Pete ! If that mad monk thinks he can catch me with my britches down ... What ? He 's got ... What ? Nothing , nothing . I ... Just stay behind me . Hey , we 're supposed to be protecting you , remember ? Maybe Alice decided to take off . No , no , she 's ... She 's here , Mykes . I mean , I 'm having major vibe-age . Alice Liddell ! ( GUNSHOT ) MAN : Gunfire ! MAN : Everybody get down ! Give us the shard ! MYKA : Pete ! PETE : Myka , she jumped out of the fireman . There . Secret Service , stay back ! Out of the way ! Okay . Please let this be Alice . No . It 's not Alice . Well , at least we know what she wants now . Yeah , she wants to kill Artie . And she could be anyone when she does it . PETE : Don 't worry , Artie . MYKA : Yeah , we 'll find her . Yeah . How we gonna find her ? I mean , we can 't make everyone in Rapid City look in a mirror . Wait , you know , it seems to me that if she 's looking for us , we have a slight advantage . Right . We should set a trap . And ... I know just the bait . Come on . Somebody order a soul-sucking hookah ? ARTIE : Okay , good , excellent . All right , let 's get the lay of the land . Two , three , four ... I count five ... Five exits . All right , Claudia , you take the front . Uh , Steve , take the two at the back . You two take the two up in the mezzanine . Where are you gonna be ? I 'm gonna be right here in the open , where Alice can see me . We can scope her out by using the reflective surfaces of the marble . Or mirrors . Or mirrors . That 's why you get the big bucks . What bucks ? There are no bucks . I get ... Fine . Listen , when she gets close , you use the Hookah . Will do . When we catch her , what then ? Well , what I 'd prefer to do is bronze the little lunatic . But she has no corporeal form , so the next best thing is back into the Dark Vault . Unless you have a better plan ? Well , maybe we ... Probably not . Artie , what makes you so sure she 'll show up ? She 's a predator . I 'm her prey . She will not rest until she 's made her kill , trust me . All right , you two , mezzanine . Claudia , you keep an eye on the front door by hiding behind that plant over there . Don 't let Alice see you . Oh , thank God you said that . Because I was gonna jump up and down and yell , " Hey , crazy Alice , look over here . " You made your point . Thank you . Steve , shouldn 't you be back at the Warehouse not getting hurt ? You were right , Artie . I have to tell Claudia about the Metronome . Okay , first things first . Just ... Back doors . Where 's my mirror ? You , my dear , are going as far away from here as possible . That is not gonna happen . Vanessa , I don 't wanna argue ... I am a member of this organization . You are a doctor . You are not a field agent . I am the Warehouse doctor . Do you have any idea how many agents ' lives I 've saved ? Including yours . Yeah , I was hoping not to need a doctor this time . Besides that , I care about you . Well , I care about you . Well , good . Then this doesn 't have to come to fisticuffs . You have five exits , four pairs of eyes . You need mine , end of story . ( SIGHS ) All right . You stand by the elevators . That 's as far away from here as possible . Artie . Yeah ? This is a peppermint patty . Oh . Sorry . Come on , take a breath , relax . Just pretend to use your Farnsworth or something . Oh , that 's smart . We make a good team . Yep , you guys are definitely not vampires . Good game . I 'm all clear . All clear here . Now we just wait and watch . I just ... I wish that ... Never mind . What ? What is it ? Something 's been bugging you . What is it ? It 's just , you know , I was trapped in that mirror for a few hours . Imagine a little girl trapped in there for over 100 years . It must be horrible . Yeah , well , she was already a bit of a homicidal maniac before the agents put her in there . Do you know how she got that way ? Yeah . No . ( LAUGHS ) She was at this tea party at the home of Charles Dodgson ... Oh , uh , AKA Lewis Carroll . You see ? I retain . Very good . Anyway , um , curious Alice found Dodgson 's handgun . And her mother tried to take it away . And when she did , it went off and , you know ... She watched her mother die in front of the mirror that eventually became her prison . Look , it 's pretty tragic . But , on the other hand , she 's trying to kill Artie . So , oh , well . I know , it 's just the Warehouse has this nasty habit of turning people psycho . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , well , tick-tock on us . Come on . Come on , Alice , I 'm right here . Where the hell are you ? Beg your pardon , but do you know which room Arthur Nielsen is staying in ? Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . We 're not allowed to give away that information . Hotel policy . Yes , but you do know which room , don 't you ? Excuse me . ( DISTANT GRUNTING ) ( THUDDING ) VANESSA : Artie ! ( GRUNTS ) Vanessa ! ( GRUNTS ) Stop . ( DISTORTED VOICE ) Stop , or I 'll cut her wide open . ( LAUGHS MANIACALLY ) Oh , my God . It 's not me she wants . It 's Vanessa ! VANESSA : No ! Stop it ! Way to go , Doc ! Find the shard . Vanessa , did she hurt you ? No . She held this mirror to my face . No , you 're all right . You 're all right . I hope you know how to use that thing . Uh , open lid , extract spirit . Seems pretty straightforward . You might wanna stand back . MYKA : It 's not here . The bellhop doesn 't have the mirror shard . Then where 's Alice ? ARTIE : She 's right over here . Artie ... STEVE : Hands in the air . Drop it ! Oh ! ( LAUGHS ) I can slit his jugular as quick as any one of you can squeeze off a shot . ARTIE : Alice . Alice . It 's me you want . You let Vanessa go . Take me instead . Artie , you and I both know this was about so much more than that . Don 't you get it ? Artie ! Artie ! CLAUDIA : Artie ! Brother Adrian 's the one who released the mirror and sent you here to kill Vanessa . That 's the plan , isn 't it ? To punish me for not undoing the Astrolabe ? See what happens when you play with someone else 's toys ? The people you love are made to suffer . You could have killed her before we came up here . You didn 't do it . Real suffering is knowing what lies just beyond your grasp yet never being able to reach it . I 'm gonna keep this body for a little while , and I 'm gonna do some unspeakable things to it before I cut your beloved Vanessa 's throat . ( GRUNTS ) Sorry , Vanessa . Claudia , now ! Suck on this , Alice ! ( ALICE BLOWS ) Ah ! ( COUGHING ) ( GASPS ) ( PETE COUGHING ) STEVE : Claudia ? ( GRUNTS ) To hell with the bloody plan . ( CLAUDIA SCREAMING ) Myka , hold her ! Open your eyes ! Get out of my friend , you bitch ! No ! Myka , get a bag ? Okay , okay . ( SCREAMING ) Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah , no , I am . I 'm not sure if Claudia is . I guess we 'll have a story to tell her . ( GROANS ) Vanessa . My ribs hurt . Yeah , I bet they do . Oh , that 's more in my head . Oh , Pete , don 't get up yet . It 's okay . Okay ... Dude , what 'd you do to your shoulder ? Huh ? Oh ! Uh ... Oh , my God . Oh , my shoulder 's killing me . Okay . Yeah , I think that you and Steve need to have a little conversation . A what ? Ow , ow , ow ! Ah ... Vanessa . We got her . It 's over ? Oh ... Yeah . All right , so we 're heading home . Dr. V , pleasure , as always . Artie , I 'II , uh , see you in the morning . Jingle , jingle . Actually , I 'm gonna go too . You 're leaving ? This was a mistake . Well , not one of our top 10 dates , but ... No , no , not the date . This . Us . What ? Look , I always believed that the life of a Warehouse agent , by necessity , had to be one of solitude , isolation . And then you came into mine . And you ... You gave me hope . I could have more . But after seeing your life threatened simply because I care about you , no , this is a mistake , and as long as we 're together , you 'll always be a target . Whoa , hold on , hold on . A few hours ago , you wanted to up our game , and now it 's just over . Don 't you understand ? Anything more than a platonic relationship is just too risky . Some risks are worth taking . Some are not ! Look , we 'll see each other at the Warehouse from time to time . No . What ? No . You don 't get to just quit on us . That 's not how this works . But after what happened tonight ... It happens all the time in this job . Being connected to the Warehouse involves danger on a regular basis . No , no , no . This is not a debate . My life has become ... My life has become more complicated than I realized . And I cannot do this right now . I 'm sorry , Vanessa . It 's over . Hey . I don 't know what 's going on with you . But when you finally wake up and realize that cutting yourself off from the people who love you is a truly terrible idea , call me . I am not going anywhere . So that 's where the phantom pains are coming from . I 'm sorry . How 's the shoulder ? It 's still a little stabby . Regretting bringing me back yet ? ( SIGHS ) You should have told me , Steve . Well , now you know how it feels . ( LAUGHS ) Okay , touche . Well , I was hoping to disconnect myself first . What ? Ow ! No ... Ow ! Okay . All right . The Metronome is the only thing keeping you alive . I can handle a little pain , apparently . And I get mortally wounded , can you handle a little death ? Because that doesn 't work for me . ( SIGHS ) Look , now that I know , we 'll figure this out together . We 're a team , are we not ? Yes . Come on . They 're waiting for us . Ow , ow , ow ! Sorry . Sorry . So Artie didn 't want to talk to you about what happened tonight . Nope . Just grumpier than usual , which is saying a lot . Hey . Hey . Claudia , however , found something in the Dark Vault that might tell us how the mirror got out . Jinksy says that someone from Artie 's past has been breaking into the Warehouse and sending out artifacts . What ? STEVE : Basically undoing his life 's work as a Warehouse agent . But nothing 's showing up on the security feeds . Which would explain why I 've been having the mega-vibes . But not why Artie 's been keeping us out of the loop . STEVE : Or what black diamonds mean . Look , guys , let 's not panic , okay ? He 's probably just trying to protect us . Yes , but from whom ? First Hugo , now Vanessa . You 're the one cutting me off from the people that I care about , not me ! You 're the one , Adrian . Not me . Not me ! Safe . It 's safe . I don 't know how you 're getting in here ... But if you 're here now , know this . You coward ! Coward ! I will find you , and I will stop you . Stop you . I 'll stop you . ( SOFTLY ) I 'll st ... Stop you . ( BEEPING )

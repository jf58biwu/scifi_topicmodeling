Washington . Yeah ... yeah . You got it ! I am telling you once again .. One moment we receive confirmation that the ship has landed successfully on the Moon Then next , all communication stopped - The signal simply vanished - Or you 're hiding something from us ? Yeah , we are hiding something on the dark side of the Moon I still find it very difficult to believe that entire purpose of the mission was to promote your President 's re-election Well believe what you like , we had mere senators spend hundreds of millions on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit-posts . But Mr Secretary , the expenses involved this time only make sense if there was a military purpose . Okay , lets get this clear The United States has no military activity on the Moon What about natural resources activity ? We know how the US sometimes mixes them two up - Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium 3 up there ? Helium ... 3 ... ? You just made that up didn 't you ? That 's so silly I assume these are just preliminary ideas ? Sir ... we have a very small delivery window - Sir ? - Yes , sir . Ma 'am , and ... this is all . Anyone who is not head of the department ... should leave You IDIOTS ! You morons ! That 's an insult to morons What is this SHIT ? ! I have a meeting with the President of the United FUCKING States of America . Tomorrow fucking morning Not the President of fucking Zambia ! Not the President of the fucking Janitor 's Union ! But the President of the fucking country in which we happen to all live above the third world ! You peaces of hilacious SHIT ! What am I suppose to tell her ? That my employees ... are not intelligent enough to be fucking morons ? That 's beautiful . I am stepping out to buy a knife .

Hey , what the fuck ? Excuse me . Get your fuckin ' hands off me , you mother ... - Is she your boss ? - Yeah , she 's the big cheese . - And she knows the president ? - Oh yeah , yeah . They real tight . You motherfucker ! ... fuck you ... Oh , come on . You fuckin ' animal . Do you know who I am ? Huh ? Do you ? You just kidnapped the wrong woman . The wrong fucking woman . Oh yeah . I hope your having a good time . I 'm gonna kick your fuckin ' ass ! Excellent . My turn . I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich . We are based on the moon . I 'm told you know the president of these United States of the Americas . You will take us to that President , because ... - I have a very special present for him . - Him ? Well he 'll loved that . He just loves presents . As soon as my mission is accomplished . The Nazi invading forces will be called in under my directions and we will end the good times for the bad people . And just how do you propose to do that ? - We 'll simply eliminate them . - What ? - Sorry , that is not what we are told . - Renate , I don 't think that you ... Yeah . Why not ? Why don 't you tell you this fräulein why we 're here . Just like you keep telling your pupils . I would love to do that . You see ... the National Socialist Party is the people 's party , nothing more . We wish to return to Earth with our message of peace and unity , love through virtue and kindness , for example . We are healthy , in mind and body . Our spirits are brave and true . And we achieve because we are strong , and disciplined in our cause . There 's simply no belief that can match ours . Because peace and unity is the gift we bring to all mankind . - What you and all earthlings need to know ... - Yeah , yeah . I get it , Hedwig . This is good . This is gonna work . You , I need . And you ... I want . Alright , let 's go meet the President . Madam President ... Here is the miracle you asked for . - Who is this man ? - He will lead the campaign troops . Renate , please ... This is very simple . The world is sick ... but we are the doctors . The world is anemic , and we are the vitamin . The world is weary , but we are the strength . We are here to make the world healthy once again . With hard work ... with honesty , with clarity , with decency . We are the product of loving mothers and brave fathers . We are the embodiment of love and bravery . We are the gift of both God and science . We are the answer to the question . We are the promise delivered to all mankind . For that we raise our hand , to one nation . We step to the beat of one drum of this world . We are the people with the children on our shoulders . In the same way as our fathers carried us and their fathers before them . We are the one people , united and strong . We are the one people with certainty . Moral certainty . We are invincible and we have no fear . Because the truth makes us ONES ! ( Song : " B Mashina " ) ( singer with an Eastern European accent ) Only one day is left only one day we are leaving the others we 're going away Today we all steal , animals we are possession is lost ( unintelligible loudspeaker announcements ) Our souls are from the wild and wings to reach the sky Let the sun fall into the ocean let the Earth erupt in flames It is enough to have the strength and knowledge to raise our Dream Machines into the sky Let them sleep who do not know The last day is here .

So , you are a formerly dead , black model ... who 's now suddenly a living white hobo ... after spending a weekend on the Moon . Is that correct ? - Yes , that 's correct . - Huh . So I was listening . And ah you , are Neil Armstrong after the sex change operation . Is this correct ? No , that is not correct . You were not listening at all . My name is Richter . Renate Richter . And I tried to save this man life and I think he 's stupid , childish and ungrateful . Okay . Ask Miss Moon-Nazi here , was I , or was I not , on the Dark side of the Moon . Okay . So his question for you is : was he , or was he not , on the Dark side of the Moon ? Yes , Mr. Washington , James Washington was on the Dark side of the Moon . There . What did I tell you ? I am black , but now I 'm white . I went to the Dark side of the Moon , but I 'm now back . And the Nazis are coming to kill us all . And you guys are going to be so sorry that you didn 't listened to me ! Mr. Washington James . Why are you so upset and so angry ? - Get lost . - But I do not understand . I mean , we made you white . We taught you the National Socialist message about peace and unity . You people have robbed me of everything . My-my race , my identity , my career . And I 'm beginning to think my flippin mind too . I mean just everything . Do you know this ? Yes . Wunderbar . Come on . Come on in . I will explain it to you . Then you will understand . You are one strange broad . I will give you that . Oh you know you 're buyin ' popcorn , right ? Man , that was bullshit . It was ... - It was so long . - Yeah . They coulda edited it down a bit . He was mocking the Führer . I 'm getting a sense there 's a lot about Nazis you don 't know . - But I am a Nazi . - Oh yeah , yeah , I know , I mean - but you 're not like ... Well , I mean , you know ... like them . A bunch of stupid bullies . No , I 'm sure , they 're good boys . And loyal to the Reich , and their mothers . Look , they are wearing the symbol of love . - The swastika ? - Yeah . Never heard it called that before . No , no . No , no no no no . You just ... What we got here , blond hair , blue eyes , nice rack . Even Hitler would get a hard-on . - Look , I got this . Look , guys , we don 't want any trouble . - Why don 't you get lost hobo . - Look , I got the funniest story to tell you . Your not gonna believe this .. - Stop that , that is enough . Oh God ! Boom ! Damn , Renate . Is that what you teach in Eartology classes ? Earthologie ... I 'm not Earthologist . I don 't know anything about Earth . I have to talk to Klaus . ( mumbles something ) Yeah ... That 's what I thought . Hey Renate , wait up ! What she needs is a good war . A war always make the president popular . Well , I might be able to help her out there . How do you mean ? One word from me , and the invasion from the Moon begins . - You never break character do you ? - No . I can never be broken . - You smell so good . - The time has come . I show you my plans . Come back here . Look , look . I 've mapped out some things . Oh big fella . All work and no play ? Now listen , do you think if I asphyxiate the President ... will the troops stand in line with us ? That 's when I will order the moon invasion . It will be choirless bloodshed . After I eliminate the moon Führer , of course . Klaus ... Adler ... Heil Hitler ! The name 's not Hitler ! Um ... so , Klaus , is the clown joining us ? What , did you all buy tickets ? Okay , so , do you want to introduce me to your friends . Get your hooks off me you crystal noob piece-of-shit . I can make this worth your while . Just please , let me go . - Do it , Moon Corporal . - Don 't shoot ! And you want to eliminate the Moon Führer . Do you know the penalty for treason ? The fleet is ready , my Führer . - Excellent . Tell them to wait for my return . We shall then begin the Meteorblitzkrieg . We 'll wipe all these sub-humans off the Earth map . KLAUS ! I need to tell you that I have nothing to do with you or your plans . You Nazi piece-of-shit . Oh well . A blessing in disguise . Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke . Farewell , puppet Führer . He fell for the old 'one last blow job ' offer . God , Nazis are stupid . I commend you on your marksmanship . Shame . She was such a nice girl . Just have to kill her later . So , it was real ? - All this time . - Never doubt a Nazi , schöne Frau . Farwell , fashionista . I have a planet to conquer ! I 'll just ... grab this . Bye . Good luck with the rest of your life . Un ... be ... fuckin ... lievable . They develop like ordinary women . But look . No hair here , nor here . Like little girls . And when they do have hair , it looks like ... The moustache of our great Führer . The pictures kind of turn me on . Herr Adler . Where 's the Führer ? The Führer is dead . Long live the new Führer . That 's me , in case you 're wondering . Sieg Heil ! This way . From now on , of course , it 's " Heil Adler " . Time ... is the sin . I 'll see you in Valhalla . At 5.45 we 'll start firing back . Every bomb will be retaliated . The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin ! Moments ago , New York has come under attack . Witnesses claim to have seen hundreds of UFO 's appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire . Billy get that . Get that . Are you getting that ? Kelly , the craft is at least 60 feet across . I 'm seeing what appears to be weapons of some-kind dangling down from the bottom . Oh my God . It 's opening fire , it 's opening fire . I 'm getting the hell out of here . There is little information . But here 's what we know at this time . - Ok , you see , the thing is , that Klaus ... - I know it was your doing . - It 's wonderful . - It 's wonderful ? It 's brilliant . I 'm a wartime president now . All presidents who start a war in their first term , always get re-elected . I thought I was gonna have to bomb Australia or something . But no , you bring me real ... - Who are these guys anyway ? - Nazis . - From the Moon . - Real live Nazis ? Holy shit , this just keeps getting better and better . You 're a miracle worker , babe . Ah , they 're the only guys we ever actually managed to beat in a fair fight . I 'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt , only you know I 'm not a spastic . I knew you 'd be excited . So , if you 're our Roosevelt , then who 's your um ... General Patton , or , you know , MacArthur ? - Mr. Secretary of Defense . Do you have any thoughts on this ? - Send her . - Me ? - Hey , you 're the miracle worker . Apparently you dodge bullets too . - I wouldn 't know .. - What to wear ? Huh !

I 'm not going back to that place . No way ! You want to look like that for the rest of your life ? Oh great . Now this is my fault . - Let me in . - I 'm no hero , James . I need you . Do you know how to drive this thing ? Well , can 't be any different than playing ' Wing Commander ' . Lets try ... I swear we do not have nothing on the Moon ! - Japan ? - It is not ours . - China ? - It is not us . It 's bloody well not ours . - I confess - Yes , North Korea ? Confess to what ? The spaceships are ours . Our beloved leader designed and build them himself . - What is so funny ? - All right , North Korea . Sit down . - So it was you India , I knew that . - No , no , no . That is a sign of peace . This is the sign of peace . Just cut it out , you morons . These thugs are Nazis . And I mean the real ... McCoy . They 've been hidin ' out on the moon just waiting to pounce . Now my question is , what do ya 'll plan to do about it ? Cuz we just happen to have a little something up our own sleeve , and I 'm sure , they 'll be thankful for it . May I present to you with the Mars exploration ship , the USS George W. Bush . Good work , take it to Officer Tyler please . Trajectory , what 's our status on the orbit window ? Commander on deck . The hostile fleet have launched a full scale aerial attack against the United States . These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they are operating fully within the thermosphere . Each of them carry approximately 200 enemy vessels and are extremely ... Hell hath no fury , Herr Adler . Alright kiddies . Let 's get this show on the road . Vivian , you look great . How is it going up there ? Madam President , I couldn 't be better . I am packing dozens of mega tons of nuclear warheads which I am going to carefully place up Klaus 's kraut ass . - Just as soon I get him in my sights . - Carry on . Kick butt . Let ' em see what that baby can do . That 's right . While you were arguing about climate change , human rights and Whales ' dicks , this is what we were doing . May I present to you the tomorrow 's exploration ship , the USS George W. Bush . Mars exploration ? But you have armed it . We have the right to bear arms , and Mars is a red planet . Working at optimum capacity . Ammo consumption within tolerance . We 're coming under extremely heavy fire . Were gonna need reinforcements right now . What the hell is the meaning of this ? G 'day mates . This is Australian ship , Dundee 01 . Ready to kick ass . Spitfire reporting in . Hang in there W. Canada joining your battle . This is a direct violation of this nations ' space treaty that you all signed , every single one of you . MIR join in za battle . That is suppose to be destroyed . This is an outrage . You 're all liars , just like my ex ex-husband . - Calm down lady , calm down . - Don 't you lady me , Pinko . Okay , who didn 't arm their spaceships ? Oh great , great . That 's just great . - You all gave me your word . - But you broke yours . We always break ours , that 's just what we do . Okay fine . Fine , fine , fine , fine . Let just beat the shit out of these pricks and ah , talk about the details later . Heroes of the First Fleet , continue your attack to the last man and remember , you 're fighting for the Reich ! - ( On radio ) Where the hell they all come from ? Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer . The Fatherland is calling its children ! This device will complete the biggest war machine of all times . The Götterdämmerung will fly ! Heil Adler ! This is beautiful . - Where the hell are we goin ' ? - To the Götterdämmerung . I think Klaus will be there . What did you think of that , Herr Adler ? Alright , what about this Moon business ? What do you say we head on over and slap them around a bit . Klaus baby , I coming to get ya ' . ATTEN-SHUN ! HEIL ADLER ! Heil ! As you were . - Well ? - The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes , my Führer . - Are your troops ready ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Richter . - What the hell is this place ? - This is the Götterdämmerung . 'It will liberate the Earth ! ' Actually . It 's the biggest war machine ever created by man . This is the bridge . That 's where I 'm going . I need to find your father , so ... - where you think he at ? - I think you will find him over there . Try to sneak in , and please paralyze the engines , - or otherwise the Earth is destroyed . - Note to self , paralyze engines . Got it . - Ok . - Oh . No-no-no-no . - What ? - You be careful . - I mean , you know , ah ... - What ? - Because , well , you like me . - Right ... Oh , come on , a little . You like me . We have a visual on the Nazi fortress , Commander . Obvious and overstated as usual , Klaus . COME ON ! Automated targeting reports hit percentage above 100 , so we 're consistently achieving double kills . BOOM , BITCHES ! Alright everyone , let 's get those nukes in action . - I 'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone . - But Commander , there are woman and children done there . The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . - Prime warheads on secondary armament . - Roger that . - Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment . - Fire the fucking nukes ! Nukes away . Job well done . Move ! Who dares to disturb me ? Who dares to disturb me ! - Dr. Richter ! - Oh ! How much time do you need ? It will fly , my Führer . The Götterdämmerung will fly to the final victory . Cut the crap . How long ? I would say three months , give or take a little . I give you three minutes . He cut me off . It 's not that easy . Russia wasn 't conquered in a day ... Hey quack ! Remember me ? The moon spook you turned into a snowflake . Start the Helium-3 engines . Start the Helium-3 engines . Now ! Start the engines . Oh shit , it 's alive . He sure must have the smallest dick in the Universe . Load the cannons . Time ... to fuck back . Everyone , take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire . - Offensive run confirmed . - Let her rip . Shit ! - Are the cannons ready to fire ? - Yes , my Führer . But the Earth is below the horizon , on the other side of the Moon . We can 't shoot . It was a full moon yesterday . Let 's make a brand new horizon . Fire at will . Fuck it ! Reactivate the systems , Weapons Unter-Offizier . We shall see ... ( Scientists ) The projectiles of the Götterdämmerung consist of metallic hydrogen , whose aggregate state is reached only under extreme pressure . Its destructive power has never been tested . The effects could be unexpected . ( scientists ) The rocket shells ... There 's no song moment now ! It 's a false alarm ! Are you all imbeciles ? Go and see what 's going on ! ON THE DOUBLE ! Renate ... - I won 't let you do it . What will you do ? Shoot me ? Good girl ... Renate Richter , almost my bride . You destroyed something beautiful , something wonderful . A future world full of Aryan children . OUR ARYAN CHILDREN ! But you betrayed me , and you shall ... you shall pay for that . Your beauty for Odin 's table ... - Klaus ! Wait ! Let me say something . - Well ? I 'm a bit busy . - I 've always respected you . As Führer , and as a man . I 've even loved you . I belong to you.To you . Cute little speech . But it 's too late , my dear . Goodbye . I understand . I hail you . My Klaus . Sieg Heil , my Führer ! - Washington , do you hear me ? Washington . - Renate . Was that you ? - You need to shut down the engines . - I 'm working on it . Holy crap . Congratulations . High five . Well that was disappointing . Do you think he suffered ? Even just a little ? Vivian , I knew you could do it . You 're foxy and salacious , all the way . Congratulations . - What 's Helium-3 ? - Helium . Did you say Helium-3 ? Yes , there like 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of the stuff . - That 's ours . - It is ? Why ? Helium-3 will make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for the next thousand years . Yes , it 's ours ! No , no-no-no-no . Hear me out . Hear me out . The Moon is American soil . Moon flag , star and stripes . Who beat the Moon Nazis ? We did . Well , yeah yeah , alright , you help out here and there , but ultimately it 's just like World War II ... and who won that ? We did . - YOU LIE ! - You don 't believe me ? Watch the movies . Movies don 't lie . Not the shoes , Jesus ! Vivian , this is the Secretary of Defense . - Defend and hold that Helium-3 at all costs . - But against who ? AGAINST EVERYBODY ! Please don 't , never again ! What was the Earth like ? Different . When can we fly there ? Soon . Soon ... But how ? - In peace . Unfortunately that 's the story of revenge . It 's messy . Never really works out the way you want it to . I feel lonely . The eternal love of God , the love of God into our hearts , or we will burn ... burn in hell , burning in eternal damnation . Renate ! Washington . You are alive . It 's okay . It 's okay . And you are the way you 're meant to be . Are you aware that you are kissing a black man ? I guess you have a lot of work cut out for you .

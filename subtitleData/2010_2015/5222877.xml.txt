 The country was infected in three hours . The entire north America continent was asleep in five . * * * no communication from overseas . * * * before quarantine protocol could be established . Doctor Holiday * * * * * still awake using electrical neural stimulation . Evos seem to be immune to the plague , which leaves us with only one agent left to deal with this mess . Ugh ! This is gonna be a ... Long day . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ It 's gonna be the last stop for those commuters if you can 't catch that train . Yeah , I know . But I got to find it first . Huh ? Uh , found it . Ughh ! Whoa ! Ugh ! Rex , report . Rex : Mission accomplished . I 'm heading back to the lab . Oh , man . I 'm gonna be sore for weeks . Oh . This is seriously wearing me out . Come on , Rex . Pull it together . Ugh ! Dr. Holiday is heading to the initial outbreak area now . She 's come up short as to any way of reversing the plague . I 'm counting on her solving this before the electric shocks damage her brain beyond usefulness . Rex : This is like spitting on a forest fire . Things are probably going wrong in every city on earth . Every life save counts , Rex . Yeah , I know . How are Six and Bobo ? Same as the others asleep . But Bobo 's an evo . He should have been immune like you . I-I don 't have a clue about this thing . Ugh ! And these shocks won 't keep me awake forever . All the more reason not to waste any more time . She 's not wasting time . No , he 's right . We 've got 60 hours at best before people start dying of thirst . And 100 or so will die within the hour if the downtown fire spreads any further . Oh . Back to work . Something told billions of viruses to evolve into a sleeping plague . The key to solving this is finding patient zero . Get up to the cayuga dam now . The floodgates are closed . It 'll crack if you don 't relieve the pressure . So , how do we find patient zero ? That 's not going to be so easy . Huh ? Whoa ! Ugh ! Oh , come on ! Hope you like fish sticks for dinner , doc . If we can find the frequency that connected patient zero to the nanites , we can trace it back to him . Fantastic . I find patient zero , shut him down , and , boom , everybody wakes up ready for breakfast . Yes . No . I mean , maybe . Ugh , I 'm so tired . I can 't think . Ugh ! And these stupid shocks . I don 't know what I 'm doing anymore . Maybe I should be studying Bobo instead . Easy , doc . Deep breaths . Is there anything I can do ? Lost it there . I 'm okay . I modified this scanner to find the nanite control frequency . But it could take hours . Dr. Holiday , where 's my update ? Do you really think she 'd keep it a secret if she found something ? She 's been working around the clock . And that 's the way it 's going to be until we figure this out . Just give me a moment . I can find the ... Doc ! Doc . That 's great . She couldn 't stay awake an hour or two more ? At least she was working on the problem . She was doing her job , which is what I expect from both of you . - Where are you going ? - To follow doc 's plan . You can stay there and decide if you 're good for anything besides yelling at people . We 're down to 18 hours before we start losing people . Like I don 't know that ? - What 's the holdup ? - I just need a second . If you can 't handle this ... What are you gonna do ... Shuffle some papers at me ? I 'm all you 've got , so back off ! You are not that special , kid . And there is way too much at stake now . White night protocols . Code designation iron mace alpha . Commence systems check . Confirm nanite shielding integrity . Put a hustle on , hotshot . Once it 's dark , it 'll be harder to find anything . Fine ! You want speed ? Whoa ! Ugh ! Ugh . Hey , freak face . The buffet is closed . I can 't . I can 't do this by myself anymore . You don 't have to . Whoa . Nice suit . Thrill me . White knight out of the office ? This really is the end of the world . I 'm trying to prevent that . This isn 't exactly a desk job . Think you can keep up ? I 'll manage . Okay . But as my sidekick , you need to have a cool name . How about " gizmodude " ? No , no , no . How about " robopants " ? Anything ? Before they went offline , the satellites showed that the plague started in this area . Patient zero is somewhere down there . What do you want me to do , go door to door like I 'm looking for a little lost puppy ? If we don 't find and neutralize the source of the plague , we 'll need to take drastic measures . The " make you glow in the dark " kind ? Come on . Pass . Maybe we can narrow our search . He 's patient zero , right ? The first one sick . So , maybe he was already at a doctor 's office or a hospital . The keep 's records show eight clinics , two major hospitals , and 82 general practitioners . See ? Now we 're getting somewhere . Try and keep up . I don 't know how Six does it . Huh ? Ugh ! Ah ! Aah ! Sorry . Won 't happen again . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm fine . Take five . You 're useless to me as a zombie . No , don 't want to slow things ... Up . Okay , okay , I 'm awake ! Make up your mind . It 's not me . It found the frequency ! Ooh , looks like a tight fit . Someone needs to lay off the milkshakes . I got it covered . You have serious control issues . Wait here . Interesting . Huh . Don 't be surprised if you get a bill for that . I think this is the virus . Viruses are too small to see . Yeah , but it 's an evo virus , remember ? I 'd say we 've got the right place . It 's still changing . I don 't think he 's finished going evo . All right . Get to it . Let 's hope this guy is curable . What ? Uh , I don 't get it . It 's working but it 's not . He just heals . What are you doing ? We 're out of options . No . I 'm trying to cure him . And failing . Back up . - But Dr. Holiday ... - Is not here . She said he was the key . You tried your way . It didn 't work . - You 're not doing this . - It 's not up for debate . Rex : If you vaporize him and it doesn 't work , we 've got no chance to reverse this plague . And you 're suddenly the genius that 's gonna figure it out ? We have only hours before people start dying . Now move aside . No . Stop it , knight , before these people get hurt . Just as soon as you step away . Aah ! That wasn 't built to fight evos . That was built to fight me . It 's for our own protection . Well , let 's see how well it works . You never trusted me . I don 't trust anything with nanites . Everything has nanites . Everything but me . Whoa ! Didn 't you ever wonder why I live in a sterilized box ? That 's why I run Providence . I can 't be corrupted . I 'll never evolve into some freak that betrays his team . I 'm the only one that can be trusted . Well , here 's the update , knight . Everybody on the planet has nanites . Everybody but you . That makes me normal . You 're the freak . You are unbelievable . I 'm ready to hear your theories , doctor . Still ? What , I got to do this a piece at a time ? Rex : Hyah ! Okay . Should have let me take him out when I still could . Yeah , well , maybe if I devolve enough pieces of his armor , you 'll get a decent shot in . Get to it . Hmm . Wait . Pieces . It 's lots of pieces . It 's working but on the wrong evo . That 's not patient zero ... that 's the virus . Patient zero was under all that growth stuff . The outside part is mutating to defend him . He 's commanding the viruses to protect him . - The plague was his first defense . - How does this help us ? Just like Holiday said , patient zero is the key . I get his nanites to send out a wake-up call , then cure him . And how are you gonna get to him under all that ? I need that thing to eat me . Yeah , I know . The crazy thing is ... it 's the second time I 've done this today . Do it ! Aah . Suit integrity compromised . Nanite breach imminent . Suit integrity re-established . What 's going on out there ? You have to keep it still . Right . Next time , I 'll let it kill me . Rex : Okay . This shouldn 't be hard . Ugh ! Ugh ! No ! I 'm not trying to hurt you . Suit integrity compromised . Nanite breach imminent . Rex : Just calm down ! Nobody 's going to hurt you . You 're safe . Time to wake them up . Suit integrity compromised . Nanite breach imminent . Suit integrity compromised . Nanite breach imminent . White knight : Doctor , where 's my update ? Still waiting on casualty reports . Of course , there would have been a lot more if it hadn 't been for Rex . It 's his job , isn 't it ? What about the monkey ? Dr. Holiday : Still asleep . Get on that . If this gives us a viral weapon against evos , we can put this week in the plus column . You got him in time . Still 100 % nanite-free . I 'm surprised you saved him . In a weird way , white knight and I are sort of alike . We 're both one of a kind , and that 's worth something . I 'm proud of you , Rex , not just for this , but for figuring everything out . Oh , sure . You know , it was , uh , pretty obvious . Now if we could only figure out what went wrong with Bobo . I 'm worried the virus may have triggered a permanent reaction . Bobo : Boy , those guys in the motor pool sure know how to party . Whoa . How long was I out ? And I 'm starving ! Who 's up for breakfast ? Good night , Bobo .

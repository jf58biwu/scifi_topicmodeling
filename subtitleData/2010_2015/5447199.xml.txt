Miss Richter , it 's the 65th birthday of the Moon Führer so we should say " Heil Kortzfleisch " ! You 're such an exemplary boy . Today , we 'll start with the most unpatriotic language . It 's the language we need to know when we return to those - who need our help . Attention ! A song moment Heil Hitler ! - Hitler ... What is that , Mr. Adler ? - A spy from the Earth . I captured him myself . He seems to be the leader of the shock troops . Mr. Adler , is this a joke ? I 'll be damned ! What 's for lunch today ? - Sauerkraut . Again ! Please say that 's not true . Capture him ! No ! Capture him ! What does he look like ? Where does he come from ? What is he wearing ? How do I look ? Like they say in English ... Klaus ! Don 't shoot . We need him for tests ... Take him to Dr. Richter 's laboratory . - Dumb negro . - He talks nonsense . - It might be a dialect . Probable reason is the skincolour . - Right . His brain structure is different from us Aryans . Let 's open up his skull and measure the brain . No . I need to know why he 's here . You have 24 hours , Doctor . Otherwise I have to rely on an ancient , infallible method . Pain . THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON D.C. Mr. Adler . - Call me Klaus . May I ? Of course . I 've come to discuss our union . Is that a marriage proposal ? - There 's no need for marriage . I received confirmation from the Department of Racial Purity . Our genetic match is 97 per-cent . - How romantic . Science demands us to unite physically . It 's our destiny to produce perfect offspring for the people . What about my scientific research ? One day , Renate ... All this will be ours . But first , I must conquer the Earth . Wolfgang , the old fart , stands in my way . In the way of final victory The two of us will take on an enormous responsibility . Your place is by my side . GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG CONSTRUCTION SITE Gentlemen ! Project Götterdämmerung . Our miracle weapon that has been under development for 40 years . The dream of our legendary Führer . But unfortunately only a dream , until now . Please , Doctor . Watch this ! This tiny device has over a thousand times more computing power than our biggest computers together . I made this cable to connect this machine with our main computer . I call this Universal Systematic Binding , USB for short . This will lift it into the air.The Götterdämmerung will fly ! You saw it ! You saw it with your own eyes ! Führer , please , let me return to the Earth . Let me get more of these devices . No one has ever returned . I will return . We don 't have a choice if we want to execute the Earth invasion . Looks good . This will solve our little problem . I 'm coming . Looks very good ! And now we just ... Why don 't you take me with you ? - Don 't worry , darling . After I 've completed my mission , I 'll come and get you . That 's not what I mean . I study the Earth ! I know everything about it . You need me . You sweet little thing , where do you get all those crazy ideas ? From books , mostly . Sometimes from films . I shall return as a hero . Heil Hitler ! - Heil Kortzfleisch ! Won 't you ever learn ? - But of course , my Führer . We have one more ace up our sleeve . Show him what we have . Voilà , gentlemen ! Doctor . Watch closely . Stand up , you fool . Oberführer Adler , I hope you 've discussed my return to the Earth . Something along those lines . The Reich trusts you . Thank you , Doctor . Take care of your daughter for me . See you in Valhalla . UPSTATE NEW YORK Renate ! What are you doing here ? This is not the place for the mother of the children of the future Führer . And definitely not the place for a woman . My place is by my man . A Volkswagen bus . Doesn 't he know ? - No . He 'll be thrilled . UNITED WORLD CONFEDERACY NEW YORK PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HQ NEW YORK 125 MINUTES LATER Heil Hitler ! The name 's not Hitler ! Do it , Moon Corporal . And you want to eliminate the Moon Führer . Do you know the penalty for treason ? The fleet is ready , my Führer . - Excellent . Tell them to wait for my return . We shall then begin the Meteorblitzkrieg . We 'll wipe all these sub-humans off the map . Oh well . A blessing in disguise . Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke . Farewell , puppet Führer . They develop like ordinary women . But look . No hair here , nor here . Like little girls . And when they do have hair , it looks like ... The moustache of our great Führer . The pictures kind of turn me on . Mr. Adler.Where 's the Führer ? The Führer is dead . Long live the new Führer . That 's me , in case you 're wondering . Sieg Heil ! This way . From now on , of course , it 's " Heil Adler " . Time is the sin . I 'll see you in Valhalla . At 5.45 we 'll start firing back . Every bomb will be retaliated . The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin ! Heroes of the First Fleet , continue your attack to the last man - and remember , you 're fighting for the Reich ! Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer . The Fatherland is calling its children ! This device will complete the biggest war machine of all times . The Götterdämmerung will fly ! Heil Adler ! As you were . Well ? The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes . Are your troops ready ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Richter . Move ! Who dares disturb me ? - Richter ! How much time do you need ? - The Götterdämmerung will fly . It will be ready for the final victory . Cut the crap . How long ? Let 's say three months , give or take a little .

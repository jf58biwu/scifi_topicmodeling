I 'm not scared of anyone . You 're scared . Humble children of the order landed last night at the Arkanar port . 30 000 of them ! No more conceited greys . Arata the Hunchback 's men are hung by the tracts . I 'm the vicar of the order . Combat master of Lands Beyond the Strait . Of the islands , etc . How 's that ? Great . The master 's boot . You were on the edge of such a fiery abyss . You don 't even know . See . Come on , that 's a boot . Does it stink ? Such a trifle matter . You understand . Poom . A man comes to you every night . For 7 years now ! It 's a lie ! You even called for a witch doctor . But you can 't get rid of him ! You 'll grow horns if you keep lying . You wrapped your head in a hide . But that 's heresy ! When man opens his eyes ... And looks at you . Right ? And he says . He opens his eyes . And he says ... Raise my eyelids . And you scream so loud your old lady pees her pants . That 's right . Come here . That man with the eyes ... that 's me ! A larger pan . Some rags . Boots . The spur 's bent . Maybe the abyss belched you out . Maybe you 're god 's son . I 'm having trouble too .

Sorry . Highest decoration of the order . For you . That 's all I can do . And take your Budakh . You go , too . Me too ? Sure . Yes . So I can sleep well ... Can you explain why you need these people ? They are useless and bad for any taste . The bookworms ? See , I 'm speaking to you . But that doesn 't mean we 're having a conversation . Why did you serve such rotten food ? That was the order . Its humble children . 200 or so years ago the order owned the Lands Beyond the Strait . Luckily , a plague sucked the order dry . It was now rotting away in the south . Over the mountains . But then it got better . It was here now . Ruthless like Brazilian ants . Rumata thought about sending at least Muga there . But didn 't get around to it ! You have so much stuff . Naughty you . Have some milk , Don . Gur . Weren 't you the smartest ? Get away Great . Like autumn leaves . Your autumn leaves clutter the scaffold . Eh , doesn 't matter if it gets pecked oat Nice place . You want me to hang the poet over here ? I recognized you right away . Branded by the monks .

He 's been on the chain since he was 3 . You let him go , he 'll die . Why I 'll be ... Stop ! I said , stop , ! Say you fell . That you weren 't born with that lip . You fell . Remember that . Take this . Don 't hide anything . Blame the redheads . Don 't argue with anyone . Listen to me ! You think you 're the only one . Learn this ! A scholar is not an enemy . The enemy is a scholar in doubt . In the name of the order ! In its name ! You 'll kill him , Don . In the name of the order . In its name . We 're killing whore 's . She 'll spread her legs , and this thing is on a spring . Rips them to pieces ! The order ! With spurs . Noble Don ! Were did you get your hands ? On this thing ! What a joy for everyone . Wipe off my temple . A thought entered his head and settled there for good . Don Reba must be killed ! Just kill him and not think about consequences . What 's going on here ? We 're flogged here , Rumata ! , Where 's your sword ? Did you hand it in , noble Don ? I see . I have this shrub . It blossomed , so beautiful ! It 's a sign ! When I was little , Don Reba gave ripe rides on a shovel , in the winter . See how it 's to breathe in the new , free Arkanar . And wine 's Reaper now , too ! They put salt on the flogging rods . Why ? What 's the salt for ? So are you breathing easily in the new , free Arkanar ? So are you breathing easily in the new , free Arkanar ? Here Stick it up your ass . Your ass , not this one ! Try to make sure the hangman sees it . Until the day I die , Rumata . Take off your hat . The Keu barons always had privileges ! There are no privileges for the older . 7 heavy rod whips ! Why heavy ones ? For thoughts without enthusiasm . Give me Budakh . I 'll do it . Here 's your doctor . Good . You remember about the ears , right ? The Dons have funny asses . Like toads ! Like your face ! So good that I found you ... Baron , but I found you ! Why are you so .. Doubled up . A courtier must be clean and fragrant . Right ? What 's wrong , Baron ? My nose is burst . I 'm so glad I found you . When you were arrested , I ran here . There were 1000 blacks here . I beat them until ... Then they threw a cow on me . From the bridge . How their crummy skulls will crack under our baronial swords . Let 's go barons ! Here Budakh , not Rudakh . Good and alive . Eating for the road . Looks okay and the teeth are intact . Are you Budakh from Irukan ? Baron , this is Budakh . Why ? Baron . First , because he has a dog 's name . Second ... wait What 's second , Baron ? I did something wrong . All this , every little piece , with my own two hands . 20 years . My whole life . Now I come to eat . The hell with you . The stuff is right there , on the left . Go be a soldier , son . Baron or noble Don who let them flog him ... Baron , the stuff . My noble friend , are my legs really skinny and white now ? Nice , nice legs . Why are you sniffing me ? Got lost in thought . I 'm such a baron , you know . And you 're a wise guy . He 'll teach me to read . Then I 'll be wise , too . But you 'll never be a Baron . My friend , give him money . Lot of it . My ribs haven 't healed yet . They 'll close the gates and . We 're dead . We will go back . They 'll open it right back . Such a turkey . Buy an eye . It reflects light . The knife was a gift . The knife was a gift ? Where are the asshole archers ? Eating turnip ? They 'll all be whipped . There . Such fun again . The sword , my friend . Where are the archers ? Hey , baron ... you won 't learn to read now . I can 't teach you , bow-wow . I 'll pee my pants . No way now . Baron Pampa del Bao-no of Arkanar . He wasn 't tried by the Big Royal Court . Or killed by the poison of the mountain bee . Or executed in a square . He was just pierced with a dozens of arrows and dumped . Rotten turnips and sour cinnamon were dumped on top of him . At night , paupers will rip everything off his huge , strong white body . Where did we stop , Budakh ? It 's impossible to talk like this . Let me go ! I ask questions , you answer . I asked you . What would you do if you were god ? I wouldn 't have any urine problems . But that 's heresy ... More , more . Damn it , they won 't let us talk . Pee all you need , and then we 'll talk . I can 't . Go there . Relax . And if you could give advice to a god ? If he asked for it ? That wouldn 't be heresy right ? I 'd say creator ! Why pee on my boots ? You came and we 're leaving . Someone killed two slaves over there . It wasn 't us . We 're officers of the order . We 're off to sleep . Come on . I 'd say ... Creator ! Give people everything that separates them . How much longer ? Finally . Thank god . That won 't do them good . Because the strong will take from the weak . I d say , punish the cruel so the strong will know not to be cruel . The strong and cruel will be punished . The stronger of the weak will take their place . You know that ... You 're a fool , Budakh . Get out of here . I don 't need you . Get out of here ... one splash and your face will be gone . I 'd say , creator , if you exist , blow us away . Like dust or puss . Or leave us in our rot . Destroy all of us . Everyone . Here It 's easy to destroy . The lice-ridden , the sick , and even the children . My heart is full of pity . I can 't do that . Let 's go home . There were many greys . Uno was wearing your shirt . He shot from the stairs . It was big on him . The greys put a noose around his neck . And strangled him . And then the blacks came and started killing the greys . One black gave me this . See , don 't touch it . Why ? Don 't touch . They gave me this sign . Told me to come to the Tower of Joy tomorrow . Why did you take it ? They gave me this . So I 'd come tomorrow . Give it to me . Don 't touch it , give it back ! He was in the pickle barrel ! Throw it out . Everyone , get out . I 'll wash my ass . Weren 't you hanged ? How could I come if I were ? Really . How did you come , Arata , if you were hanged ? Arata . The Hunchback ! My back . Goran likes cripples . You 're a cripple ! First my guys trusted this virgin . Don . The Don of peasants ! You can 't make sausage . I thought he 'd be bigger . Arata the Hunchback . They now hang them by the balls on the same trees . I almost forgot you 're a god ! That 's too bad . Your water ยก s cold ... Make some hotter water ! Once I was being hanged on an old galley . I jumped off just in time . Angel ! Come here ! Don 't stare . One 's too much for you . I knew a while back that god died ! Come on , really ? ! He pulled this load , like a horse . Then he got snotty and died . There 's no other way ! It 's hard for a god . I saw you getting snotty today . I have bad news for you . Today you 'll give us the fiery chariot and these shirts . And in the morning you 'll lead us ! - Or else ? ... - What ? Or else you have a soft white belly and bellybutton . If you poke it , there 'll be a wind . My belly button . Come on . That was a bird . That 's an omen . For money . You 'll fly to your Daddy . Everyone will fly one day . Like birds . Will we have enough water ? Somebody , hold my wallet . Arata ! You see that , cow ? Leave the ring . Give it here . I wouldn 't kill you . Really ? You don 't know that ! You 're so dressed up . How was the trip here ? I won 't get you the throne . That 's the truth . That was right . I 'd burn the gold and black vermin . As far as 12 generations back . That you 're good at ! And you 'd give land out to your own . Right ? Yeah . A man 's skin is made up of tiny holes . They breath too . Lf you cover a man with tar ... that 'll be it . That 's for you . That 's it ? Good boy Arata . Without it , they won 't let you out of the city . Tell me , Arata . So you give the land to your men . Who needs land without slaves ? Who needs it without slaves ? There 'll be new slaves . New scaffolds . New golds . And a new Arata . And god can 't do anything . That 's sad . I 'd never allow that , you louse . Quiet now . You won 't be able to do anything . You 'd allow it , everyone did and always will . For thousands of years . What do we do ? The same as always . You 're a redheaded bastard . Muga , introduce him to your tobacconist ! They 'll make good friends ! Chase him with sticks through the barnyard . Okay . So what 'll happen to me ? You 'll remain in songs . That 's it ? That 's not really that little , believe me . Master , the blacks are asking for the girl with the sign . I knew it . That 's it ! Let 's cut some ears ! Stop shaking . Let me eat . My arm hurts . You 'll go with me . You 'll confirm there 's a boy in my belly . Groan 's grandson . I won 't go without pants . My pants are wet now . You 'll go . Eighteen generations of noble ancestors . Royal blood and no pants ! I won 't go without . Give me dry pants and I 'll go to war . I want silver pants . I don 't want to be covered with lard and burned . Like a chicken . So don 't go . Ferret ! I 'll chase them into the gulf . Up to their asses . I promise . I 'm sorry you did ' t know Baron Pampa . Forget it ! You could at least clean the house ! Did you find any ? No . The turtle was eating , mice in the pants . I found some . And the turtle , too . Laces . What ? Laces ? Did you brind my swords , silly girl ? Blood is sticky . Okay . There . God , if you exist , stop me . Run ... God decided to start killing . Go away ! Stop ! You can 't , not Arima ! There he is . See , he eats monkeys . My name is Arima ! My name is Arima . That 's no problem . I didn 't bring everyone . Some strange monk did . They 'll all be punished . These people are like kids . He was standing there , calling . I saw him . With a wall-eye . A crippled hunchback monk . He brought all those fools ! Look , or I 'll flog you to death ! It 's a mistake . It was some strange , monk . I 'm the eye of the order . That 's my job ! The Creator gave us pain . I went to university too . My hands are slippery . Everyone here . You too , student ! Heresy . Heresy ! I didn 't take anything ! The hat of sorrow ! Nobody steals under the order . Everyone . God , stop me . Like it 's not me . Not everyone 's destined . I can 't either . I feel nauseous . It 's just ... why . Here , a gift for you . It 's the court martial Summons to the office . The Tower of Joy . Not funny . He 's here too . What did I do ? I never left the house . That 's death . And that 's life . Life . And life again . Here Your destiny . Kiun from Tin Street . Defamation of the order . That 's serious . Nothing good about you , too . You can pardon all these ones , Don . Why don 't you give me , the stupid Don ? 200 more street luvvies . You 'll find someone else . You don 't care who to burn . Isn 't that right , student ? Stop . Put the boards down . Rock him so the shit drips off . A student . An impotent and inept one will give up without knowing where the monster 's heart is the monster even has one . Don , I think I 've gone blind ! An officer. it squelches here . It always squelched here . It 's slippery . What might be ... nothing might be . I 'll show you something . You 'll pee your pants ! Again , didn 't I ... Shush . Flies . This is Arata the Hunchback . So , wall-eyed man . Why didn 't you spare the young girl ? You bastard . His arrow is marked ! This is the boar YI . You idiot ! It 's the boar ! This is a cow , I tell you . Leave him , he 's suffered enough . Arata killed the girl ! The mark on the arrow is the same . He wanted to draw Rumata out against the blacks . But drew him against himself . I saw it ! Condor , something 's shiny over there . I 'm not flying to Earth with you ! No , nothing shiny . I 'm not ! That 's stupid , Pashkar . You 'll be sorry if you go behind my back . See what I learned here ? Lf you say no - then no . Well , you old ass . This is not my work , it 's yours . You fucking theorist . You 're crap ! The crap of the Siou bird . You 're all set for life in a nuthouse on Earth . Or maybe in jail . Or maybe you even have a brain tumor . There are snakes there ! Here , take this . He 's a thief , and you keep throwing gloves . Pashka , we 're dueling . It 's come to this ! A god can be tired , too . Get out of here . I 'm sleepy . You write books , but you have no thoughts . Here 's one . Where greys triumph ... Where greys triumph , blacks always , always come in the end . There 's no other way . Remember . And now leave . Hey if you write about me , and you 'll probably have to ... Write that it 's hard to be a god ! And I 'll get some sleep . God , spit on me , so I won 't ever be sick . And spit in my hand , too . I 'll take it to my brother . Don 't you dare call him a god ! We 'll be punished ! Come on , a kid won 't speak in vain . He doesn 't look at me . Come on , look at me ! Stop hovering . These university guys . They kept running around the tower , screaming . The fat one didn 't want to fly . Stronger than beer . Don Leonardo and Don Fatso . They killed each other . Here Why ? You bastards ! That Don Leonardo . They drank away the round glass and the boards . So what ? Nothing . Muga , what does your tobacconist say ? Where is he ? Left his house ... and never came back . It happens . Will you find him ? I told you to take the stocks off . Why don 't you take them off ? You 're fucking nuts ! I also left my house a long time ago , and never came back . What ? Out of the way noble Don ! Or the wheel will get your boot . Hey you forgot the chair , fools ! Do you like this music ? I don 't know ... it makes my tummy hut . Yes .

 Previously on " The 100 " ... Welcome to Mount Weather . So we meet again . Clarke , no ! If you pull that lever , these people will die . Even a little radiation could kill them . - It was a containment breach . - Help ! Your circulatory systems developed the ability to filter radiation . If we were to circulate Maya 's blood through your system ... It could make her better ? The first human trial was a success . Why bring them here , if not to use them ? I saw everything . I know what you 're doing to them . We have to get them out . We gather intel on Mount Weather and we send a team after Kane . - Where 's Finn ? - Looking for you . Where is the girl who was wearing this watch ? ! Your friends are not here . We need to go ! Finn ! I found you . _ Ok , tell me again . It 's a labyrinth . We got to the dam through this tunnel . It 's all connected to the mine system . That 's our way in . Sure , if we can get past the Reapers and the Mountain Men . I swear to God , if your mom doesn 't sanction a mission soon , I 'm going by myself . You won 't be by yourself . Guess the inquisition 's over . How 's Finn doing , anyway ? I haven 't talked to him since we got back . I don 't know what to say . He just kept shooting . We 're at war , Clarke . We 've all done things . Hey . Hey . Next round 's on me . Mount Weather ? What 's the plan ? Still working on it . Ah ! Check it out . Salvaged Monty 's still from the drop ship . Now , I guess , you know , if they could just salvage Monty , huh ? Easy . It was just a joke . Ok . You , uh , tell her we were cleared ? No . Well , it looks like our pardon for surviving includes our time on the ground . Now bigger fish to fry , I guess . We did what we had to do . I got to go . Trouble in paradise ? Just because they pardoned you doesn 't mean I have . Clarke . Beat it , Murphy . Well , then , have a good one . I know why we haven 't heard from any of the other Ark stations . Mount Weather 's jamming us . Show me . I tweaked the resonator and got this . It 's on every frequency . Long-range communication is totally screwed . It 's also why the range in our walkies sucks . It 's the same signal Monty heard on the black box of the exodus ship . Mount Weather crashed the exodus ship . Can you get around the signal ? Around it ? No . But if I can get to the tower that broadcasts it , I can make it go boom . No one is going anywhere . - Mom , listen to me ... - What do I have to do to get through to you ? You and your friends are not soldiers , and continuing to act like you are puts lives at risk . You don 't understand . Raven found something . Mount Weather is jamming our communications . It 's true . There could be other Ark stations on the ground . And more guards . You said we don 't have enough people to fight a two-front war . Mom , we 're already fighting one . The Grounder retaliation for the massacre could happen at any time , and when it does , we need every available man to defend this camp . So let us go . You 're not gonna stop , are you ? Not until my friends are safe . Ok . But I 'm coming with you . Ma 'am , I just said ... It 's been quiet for two days . Maybe Kane is making headway with the Grounders ' commander . Or maybe he 's dead , and they 're massing against us as we speak . Maybe ... which is why we need more guards . Then it 's settled . We 're going back to Mount Weather . Sir , it 's been 3 days and Maya 's numbers are still climbing . It 's too soon to be sure , but I believe she may actually be metabolizing radiation on her own now . Jasper 's blood was 8 times more effective than any outsider we 've ever measured . I 'm still running tests , but his system appears to have jump-started hers . You 're saying that it 's a permanent solution ? Maya can survive on the ground ? I 'm saying it 's possible . I 'll keep watching her . In the meantime , sir , you have to let me move forward with the rest of the 47 . No . Dad , I ... I agree with her . I know that the plan was to assimilate them into the gene pool , but this changes everything . She just said it 's not proven . Mr. President , even if it 's not a permanent solution , with their blood , we 'll need fewer treatments , we 'll live longer , and we 'll feel better . Jasper volunteered . I will not put those kids in cages like animals . No one wants that . If you can convince the rest of them toteer , great , but what if you can 't ? Every day , you paint the outside , and if Dr. Tsing is right about this , then you might be able to see it again , dad . Listen to me . You need to understand this . If I give the order to harvest those kids , I won 't deserve to see it again . Where are you going ? To find you some volunteers . Ahem . He 'll come around . What if he doesn 't ? What if they don 't volunteer ? Then we 'll have to do it anyway . I can 't believe they let Finn come . He 's the best tracker we 've got . Don 't forget to look up . The Grounders use the trees . That 's how we lost John Mbege . You were right to have me bring them . Don 't worry . Your guards will get there . I know you 're worried about Finn . Thank you for voting to clear him . Thought he was rescuing his friends . The real question is , is he going to be able to clear himself ? Kane , stop . If they wanted to kill us , they would have done it already . Oh , two days without food or water . Come on . How many times on the Ark did we go two days without water ? This ... this is not how our story ends , Marcus . We wind up in the same train station on the ground just to die in it ? We still got work to do . How can you be so sure ? My son told me . Stop ! We came in peace . We came in peace ! Please ! You speak of peace while you send an assassin into one of my villages . What are you talking about ? Blood ... must have blood . One of you will die here , today , by the other 's hand . I will hear the terms of your surrender from the man who lives . _ They want us to turn on each other . They want justice . Lives have been lost on both sides . That 's why we need to end this war ! What 's your name ? Lexa . Lexa . I 'm Thelonious ... and this is Marcus . Your commander spoke of an assassin in a village ? Yes . Eighteen of our people were murdered . Elders ... Children . We have nothing to do with that . It doesn 't matter . The commander thinks you did . One of you must pick up the knife . That is our way . And if we refuse ? Then the commander will use it to slit both of your throats . Jasper . I 'd hoped to catch you before you were discharged . I see I 'm not the only one impressed by your courage . Oh , I just did what anyone would do . I 'd like to believe that 's true . May I walk with you ? Sure . After what happened to Maya , I 'm sure it won 't come as a surprise to you to learn that we 're not entirely safe here . Mount Weather wasn 't built to last this long . Over time , trace amounts of radiation seep inside . The breach in the dorm is an extreme example . We have methods for dealing with this , but frankly , those methods pale compared to what we saw with you and Maya . Sir , I ... I don 't think I could do that for everyone . Of course not , but if you could inspire your friends to follow your example , imagine the difference you could make here . There . I see it . Here . It 'll be dark soon . We 'll never spot the traps . We should set up camp here , leave at first light . We 're missing two . Where the hell are they ? Bellamy ! Octavia ! Clarke , we 're in enemy territory , and their lives are my responsibility . They went to find a way in . A way in . That 's not what this mission is about . It is for them . Find them . - Bring them back . - Yes , ma 'am . You two with me . Let 's go . I 'm going with them . Finn , wait . We need you here . Why ? So you can keep an eye on me ? You 'd have to be able to look at me to do that . Finn ... What do you think I 'm gonna do ? Finn . I 'll go get him . Finn ! Come back . It was an accident . What was that ? Run ! Acid fog ! Take cover ! If you can hear me , use the tents ! My tent ! I forgot my pack ! It 's ok ! We can make it to the bunker ! According to Clarke , before the bombs , there were buildings everywhere here . I 'm guessing some of them had access to the bunker . So we 're looking for ruins , anything that 's manmade , ok ? Hey ! Blake ! Let 's go , right now . In case you 've forgotten , we 're not under your command . Don 't make us do this the hard way . Come on , Scott , 47 of our people are prisoners in this mountain . - And that 's why we 're out here . - Wrong . You 're out here to find other stations of the Ark . We 're out here to find our friends . Bell . What are they doing ? Running . Acid fog ! We need cover ! Now ! Deploy the tents ! Let 's go ! Yeah , I got it . Let 's get all the canvas out now . O ! O ! Get back here ! Bell ! There 's something in here . Maybe it 's the ruins . Hey ! Hey ! Over here ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! I found it ! - Come on , pull . - Hurry up ! Hey ! Quick ! Get inside ! Come on , move ! Let 's go ! Move ! It 's too late ! You ok ? Yeah , I 'm ok . I 'm ok . Clarke ? Clarke , do you read me ? We 're closer to the source . It 's swallowing short-range now , too . Clarke , do you read me ? Damn it ! Clarke and Finn know these woods . She left her pack , and her tent is in it . They 'll find shelter . - What is that ? - I don 't know . It sounds like they 're jamming every frequency but this one . You hear that ? This one 's clear . That sounds clear to you ? Will be once I crack the encryption . Ok , English , Raven . What does that mean ? It means ... we 'll be able to listen in on Mount Weather . Let 's go . Where are we ? Looks like a garage . More like a tomb . Look , I 'm sorry about your man , but we need to find an access door to Mount Weather . - Hey , not so fast . - Sir , that fog could keep us pinned down for another ... We 'll split up . Be back here in 15 . Be safe . Let 's go . Stop . I 'm sure they 're fine . Everybody had tents . So first you can 't look at me , and now you 're looking at me like I 'm the enemy . I 'm not looking at you like that . Well , you don 't look at me the way you used to . I 've been waiting for the right moment to give you this . It 's starting to feel like that moment might not come . I know how much it means to you . Where did you get this ? It was around his neck . Guys , think about everything they 've done for us . I mean , they gave us shelter , clean clothes . They kept us safe from the Grounders . Miller ? They saved your life , right ? - Dude , you puked for 3 days . - That was different . The normal treatments wouldn 't be as bad . - So they say . - So what , then ? Only puking for one day ? Nah . I 'm out . Sorry , Jasper . I 'm out , too . Come on ! They gave us cake ! I got a sign-up sheet . Dude . - What are you doing ? - What ? When did you start working for them ? You know what ? Never mind . Now that you 're better , I 'm going after Clarke . Of course . Right on time . Hey , guys . Jasper . I 'm so glad to see you 're feeling better . Thanks . I am . - _ - You look , um , rested . Hey , it 's pizza day . Heh ! Who 's hungry ? We don 't have much time , but we can talk freely here . What the hell is going on ? Maya ? I 'm sorry . About what ? What ? What do you mean , it wasn 't an accident ? She means they exposed her to radiation on purpose . I 'm betting it was to get you to agree to be her blood brother . I knew it . Clarke was right . Monty , be quiet . Did you know about this ? - No . - And why would they do that to you ? Because the standard treatment sucks compared to you . That 's what Dante said . What 's the standard treatment ? Through there . Oh , my God . Are those ... All Grounders ? Wait a second . Why are you showing us this ? Because I 'm afraid . Of what ? That you 're next . Who else knows about this ? Everyone , but nobody talks about it . We learn not to ask questions . Look , without the treatments , we 'd die . What are we supposed to do ? Die . We have to get out of here . Dante said we could leave , right ? He was lying . He knew I 'd be too scared to leave , just like he knew I 'd do what had to be done to save Maya . So we don 't ask . If Clarke got out , we can , too . You 'll never make it . Ever since Clarke disappeared , security all around the mountain has been increased . - We have to try . - We 're not leaving . I won 't leave the others behind . That means they end up in there . What choice do we have ? We volunteer . What 's taking so long ? I 've almost got it . They 're using a type of audio modulation here , like a feedback loop . I just need to pinpoint the origin of the loop , hone in on the pure transmission . I just need to find the right side and report back . Over . - You did it . - Copy that . Checking the Western boundary line . Stand by . Over . No signs of life . Over . Has the veil lifted yet ? Over . Negative , sir . Coverage is still 90 % . Over . Keep searching . When they pop above , hit them again . Over and out . " The veil . " They 're talking about the fog . It 's a weapon . Which means they attacked us . Sergeant Porter ? Yes , ma 'am ? Build your bomb . When that fog lifts , take the tower down . - Copy ? - I copy , ma 'am . What 's wrong ? We 're listening to the enemy . Blow the antenna , and we won 't be able to do that . Don 't blow it , and we won 't make contact with any other Ark survivors , and we need those reinforcements , Raven . Tough call . I know what Clarke would do . Man , I hate that sound . Check this out . Who 's that ? Blake ! That you , Blake ? I don 't see anything . ♪ Ding dong ding dong ♪ ♪ ding dong ding dong ... ♪ Scott ? Are you there ? Bell , what 's that ? Reapers . - O. - What ? Take this . Don 't . It 's Lincoln . Lincoln . Lincoln , it 's me . It 's Octavia . - Oh ! - Octavia ! Aah ! Get up . Get up . We need to get somewhere safe . This has gone on long enough . There has to be some other way to resolve this ... something that we haven 't thought of yet . There isn 't . She 's right . They 're not budging . We can offer a trade . These people are primitive . I 've seen how they live . Our technology , our medicine . All we 'd ask for in return is peace . If we truly want peace ... He told us how to get it . Through murder ? Through sacrifice . Marcus , what are you doing ? If we don 't make a choice ... then we 'll both die . And the killing won 't end . There 's only one way out of this . You have to kill me . You have to do this . It 's our only choice . Kane , no . They respect strength . Let 's show them ours . I said ... no . You did not order the massacre . Not that one . Marcus , you don 't need redemption . The choice we made on the Ark was about survival . We did what we had to so that the human race could survive . The human race was already surviving . Then we did it for our people ! Yes , and now we must do this . It 's the only way . Not gonna happen . You 're a good man , Thelonious . I won 't let you die for me . Marcus , no ! Come on . Help us . Please . Please . Come on . Please . Thank you . I told you , we didn 't come all this way to die . Thelonious ! No ! I choose to live . He 's a Reaper ? How is it even possible ? He just looked right through me . - Shh . - How ? Huh ? Did he see us ? I don 't know . Shh . Just listen to me . We 'll get him back . I promise . Take off these chains . Thelonious , please , she 's just an innocent girl . _ Ok . _ _ You 're the commander ? I 've learned much about you . It 's clear your intentions are honorable . Your desire for peace is true . _ Later we will talk . In the meantime , your friend will be used to send a message . No . No . No . Don 't look at him . Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Please ! The massacre must be answered . Blood must have blood . You sure you 're ready for this ? Ok . Draw him in . I 'll do the rest . Lincoln ! Lincoln ! Can you hear me ? - I 'm sorry . - Hey ! Now what ? Now we take him home . The fog has cleared . Clarke ? They were unarmed . We have to go . I don 't even know who you are anymore . Neither do I. What have we become ? And you 're all set , Monty . The general anesthetic will take effect shortly . You won 't feel a thing . How high are you right now ? Oh , I almost don 't care that there 's a 6-inch spike in my neck . Ohh . I must say I 'm impressed , Jasper , and deeply grateful . These are just the first , sir . More will come . I have no doubt . You saved us , right ? It 's the least we could do . You see , Doctor ? That 's our future . You just have to have a little faith in our shared humanity . I hope they 're all this compliant . Don 't worry about her , dad . Dr. Tsing isn 't big on admitting when she 's wrong . But I got to hand it to you . We 're getting the most effective treatments we 've ever had , and it 's all because you asked nicely . You think I 'm stupid ? Tell me you weren 't behind the breach that almost killed Maya . I wasn 't . Dad , I wouldn 't ... I wouldn 't do that . I love you , Cage , and there 's been a Wallace in this office since the bombs , but if I find out that you 're lying , there won 't be one after me . Am I making myself clear ? Check it out . I love this song . ♪ Come fashion all the ♪ ♪ I know ... ♪ Ok , it 's safe to talk . We bought ourselves some time , but we 're gonna need to recruit some of the others , only people we trust . How much more time are we talking about buying here ? Exactly . Long enough for Clarke to break us out . We don 't even know if Clarke 's still alive . She has to be . Well , then she better hurry the hell up . Bellamy and Octavia ? They know to rendezvous here . Have you tried to radio ? - Still jammed . - You didn 't blow the tower . Raven figured out a way that we could listen to Mount Weather . If we took out the antenna , we wouldn 't be able to do that . What about the other Ark stations ? We don 't know if they made it . What we do know is that 47 of our people are being held prisoner on that mountain . We 're gonna get them out . I 'm sorry . We all have battle scars , Finn . Suck it up ... And build a brace for yours . Help ! Stay here , Chancellor . Help me ! Show us your hands . Stand down . Thelonious . I have a message from the commander . Leave ... or die . We have two days .

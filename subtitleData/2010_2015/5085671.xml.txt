 ♪ There are too many of them . [ Imitates gunfire ] Six : Keep this channel clear . Rex : Six , do you really expect us to get to back to Providence by 1800 hours in this slowpoke convoy ? Just jet the cargo , will you ? We 'd be there by now . Six : Except we 're transporting unstable nanites , which have to be kept at or below sea level . Even one wrong bump , and the whole thing could go off . Rex : And if it blows , you 're on a battle transport . Meanwhile , we 're stuck in this delivery truck , carrying whatever . What are we carrying , anyway ? Bobo : Toilet paper . Six : One , everyone in this mission has a part to play . Rex : Seriously ? ! Toilet paper ? ! Six : And , two , we 're under strict radio silence . Six out . Rex : Radio silence , convoy security protocols , scheduled bathroom breaks , and they won 't even let me drive . So many rules all for what ... Some nanites ? Noah : Unstable nanites ... the most dangerous nanites on earth . Rex : Well , at least there 's not an anti-tunes order ! [ Radio squeals ] Noah : That radio 's ancient . You 'll be lucky if you can get it to play static . Rex : Oh , I think I can manage to crank some bass out of it . [ Electronic warbling ] [ Up-tempo rock music playing ] Noah : Not bad ! Rex : What ? ! Noah : I said , " not bad ! " Bobo : [ Gasps ] [ All coughing ] [ Tires screeching ] Noah : Bobo , slow down ! We can 't see anything ! Bobo : [ Sputters ] I got one good eye that 's closed half the time , and now you 're worried ? ! [ Tires screech ] [ All coughing ] Noah : And we lost the convoy . Bobo : Relax , blondie . We 'll catch up . That 's why they invented speeding .

What do you think of the spyglass ? Am I taking this pirate thing too far ? - I haven 't become a cliché , have I ? - No , Gatlocke . It fits you . Gatlocke : Oh , good ! Because if you 'd said , " yes , " I would have thrown you off the cliff . [ Chuckles evilly ] No , seriously , I would have . Ladies and gentlemen , the convoy is directly beneath us . Wait . Do we have any ladies in my gang ? No ladies ? We need to get with the times . Let 's see about getting some ladies in the gang . Gentlemen , grab your weapons , charge up the scramblers , and attack . [ All shout ] They 're jamming all channels . We 're cut off , sir . [ Tires screech ] Gatlocke : Ready the ion-cannon thingumabobs ! [ Ion cannon whirs ] [ Tires screech ] Six : Fall back ! Cover the cargo carriers ! Rex : You know what this means , don 't you ? - Noah : We 're lost ? - Rex : No . It means no one is around to tell me I can 't drive . Hand over the wheel , Bobo . Bobo : You can 't drive ! Noah : Radio 's broken , so we can 't even call for help . Rex : We don 't need help . We 're not lost . Men don 't get lost . We go exploring . And why should you care if I drive ? Unless you made some kind of deal with Six . Bobo : You 'll have to ask my bank account . Six : Defend the cargo ! Don 't let them get to the trailers ! Gatlocke : [ Humming ] [ Gunfire in distance ] [ Whirring ] [ Humming continues ] [ Grunts ] As of this moment , the unstable nanites have officially been jacked . [ Tires screech ] [ Laughs evilly ] Give me a reason . Give me one good reason . [ Laughs evilly ] I 'm only kidding . Like I need a reason . Six : We 'll regroup outside the canyon ! Get us out of here now ! Sir , they got the cargo . Six : I 'm aware of the situation . Rex wasn 't with the convoy when we were attacked . Fix the radio and find him . Of all the days to disobey orders . Rex : Pit stop successful ! [ Cans rattle ] Bobo : [ Grunts ] Noah : [ Grunts ] [ Blows ] This soda is expired . Rex : I know ! They were practically giving it away ! Bobo : [ Spits ] Agh ! This tastes like feet ... and not the clean kind ! Rex : Fine ... more for me , then ! Noah : By now , they must 've noticed that you 're gone . Rex : No one 's going to miss a delivery truck . [ Tires squeal ] Hurry up ! Noah : Go faster ! [ Tires screech ] Rex : Ladies , how 's it going today ? Yeah , we roll in a big truck . Other guys may flake on you , but me and Noah ... we deliver . [ Both laugh ] [ Tires screech ] [ All shout ] I think we actually had a chance back there . Gatlocke : Gentlemen , congratulations on a job well done . Your commitment to ... Oh , forget it . Open the truck ! [ Metal creaking ] Communications are still down , sir . - We can send a cycle for help . - Six : No . I want everything available searching the area . - For the attackers ? - Six : For Rex . [ Metal creaks ] He 's not transporting what he thinks he is . Given the circumstances , he should probably know . Let 's just hope he didn 't get himself lost . [ Sloop ! ] Bobo : Okay ... I think we might be lost . Rex : Whoa , whoa . Noah gets the wheel ? What about me ? Bobo : Think about it , soda jerk . My mouth still tastes like week-old socks . Plus , goldilocks has a license , and you don 't . But mostly the soda thing . - Noah : I think I know where we are . - Rex : Don 't sweat it . Who 's gonna miss a truck full of toilet paper ? Bobo : Hey , I 've been there ... ain 't pretty . Gatlocke : Feel that ? It 's quilted . This is the good kind . But I won 't be able to really enjoy it until I have those nanites ! - Gatlocke , I found something . - Gatlocke : Something is good . Our scout took this image when the convoy left the proving grounds . Gatlocke : I like how he framed this shot . See the rock formations in the foreground here ? But this is from the canyon . Where 'd the white delivery truck go ? Gatlocke : Why are you asking me ? I don 't know where it went . Fan out ! Dig around the desert ! Find me that truck ! And an iced tea ! Rex : Noah , you 've got to listen to me . Let ... Me ... Drive ... The truck ! Noah : I don 't know . Bobo : The answer is still no ! Noah : All right , we 're back ! This is the right road . Rex : How can you tell ? All the roads look the same out here . Noah : [ Gasps ] [ Tires screech ] [ Tires screech ] Gatlocke , you 're not gonna believe what I found . Noah : This canyon ... it 'd be the perfect place to spring an ambush . Rex : The nanite transport is gone . Six , can you hear me ? [ Static ] Six ? Providence , come in . [ Static ] - Go ahead . - Rex : Connect me to white . Now would be good . Noah : We 're sitting ducks here . Bobo : Quack , quack . [ Tires screeching ] [ Tires screech ] Um , I 'll call you back . [ All grunting and murmuring ] Gatlocke : Allow me to introduce myself . I 'm Gatlocke anarchist , struggling businessman , scoundrel . Okay , that 's a lie . I 'm not struggling . But let me ask you , do you like rules ? Rex : Can 't say I do . Gatlocke : Me neither . I hate them . It 's why me and my men live by the anarchist 's code . For us , there are no rules . Except no cursing . [ Whirring ] Gatlocke : True . We 're anarchists , not animals . You know what I 'm talking about . I feel like we have a connection . We 're practically friends . So , if you could do me a favor , it would help me out a lot . Rex : What kind of favor ? Gatlocke : I need you to hand over the truck . I mean , I really need you to hand it over ... Now . Rex : This truck ? It 's not all that great . The radio doesn 't work . It handles like a box on wheels . At least , I imagine it does , 'cause someone won 't let me drive . Gatlocke : Please don 't play dumb with me . Rex : Dumb ? Oh , see , dumb is pulling a blade on me ! Gatlocke : Ooh , I like this kid . [ Snaps fingers ] Rex : [ Growls ] Get back to the truck ! Gatlocke : I have a bad case of evo envy . [ Engine turns over ] Rex : [ Groans ] Noah : You 're risking our lives to save a stupid truck ? Rex : It 's the principle . [ All scream ] [ Tires screech ] [ Bos cracking ] [ Engine revs ] [ Tires screech ] Whoa ! They really want that toilet paper . Bobo : They didn 't exactly look like poster boys for good hygiene . Noah : Are you sure that 's even what we 're carrying ? I mean , did anyone actually bother to check ? Bobo : Don 't bother me with the details . Noah : That 's definitely not T.P. [ Beeping ] Rex : We were carrying unstable nanites the whole time . Bobo : We should be fine as long as none of the warning lights are on . Noah : You mean all the red , blinky ones ? [ Beeping ] Bobo : Aw , boy . Rex : Giving us the nanites ? What was Six thinking ? Bobo : He was thinkin ' that if the convoy was to get attacked , where better to have the cargo than with you ? Rex : Could 've at least told us we were carrying something that could blow up . Noah : Whoa ! [ Beeping ] Rex : Glad I 'm not driving . Six : We have 10 more minutes till Providence starts missing us . When we don 't check in , they 'll send jets , and coming in blind , there 's a good chance they 'll get shot down like ours did . We 're working as fast as we can , sir . Whatever they used completely fried the relays . Six : Then we 'll need another option . Well , there is one possibility , but it 's a little old-fashioned . Rex : Let me take the nanites and zoom out of here . Noah : Didn 't you hear Six ? They can 't go above sea level . One wrong bump will make them go off . Bobo : Kid 's right . They 're safer in the isolator back there . Rex : All right , fine . Then we 'll just deal with the road hogs ourselves . Noah : So ... any idea on that ? Bobo : I vote " try not to die . " Gatlocke : [ Laughs evilly ] [ Metal screeching ] Rex : Look on the bright side ... the unstable nanites didn 't go off . Gatlocke : That 's what I love ... an optimist . I love this kid . Rex : You 're insane . Do you realize that ? Gatlocke : Me ? Gatlocke ? Insane ? Frankly , I don 't see it . Just let me have them . I 'll split the money with you down the middle , 50 / 40 . Rex : Wow , after all that , you 're nothing but a common thief . Gatlocke : Common " ? " Common " ? Tear open the truck . [ Door creaking ] It 's no here . Ugh ! [ Tires screech ] - Noah : That was some escape plan . - Rex : It was one of my plans . I have a couple different angles I 'm working . Noah : What 's your " angle " now ? Rex : I 've got the unstable nanites right here ! Bobo : Ah , this is an improvement . Rex : Back off , or I 'll send us all to kingdom come ! Gatlocke : You wouldn 't dare . Rex : Or would I ? You say we 're a lot alike . Gatlocke : You would . Rex : Unh ! [ All scream ] Aw . Quit while you 're behind , Gatlocke . Gatlocke : [ Growls ] Gatlocke : [ Growls ] [ Engine revving ] Rex : We 're clear . Now , aren 't you glad about the soda ? [ Tires screech ] Bobo , take the nanites . I 'll keep them off your tail .

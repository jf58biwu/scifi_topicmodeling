 Don 't let him get away . Where are you , Marshall ? You get everything settled in okay ? More or less , I suppose . - Well , that 's good because we 've got seven days of this luxury before we get there . Where is that again ? Earth . I just love to hear the sound of it . Uh . Where 's our date ? He 's checking the cargo again . Really ? Yup . Why does that not surprise me ? What 's his deal , anyway ? What do you mean ? I mean , doesn 't he seem kind of ... ladies . Everything still there ? - Yes . Everything locked in and accounted for . - Still don 't understand why we have to bring all that stuff . It 's just a matter of efficiency . If they 're gonna send us all this way , they might as well save on some fuel and haul stuff at the same time . - So , does that make us custodians or caretakers ? Multitaskers . Scrap-sitters . - It 's a pretty small price to pay , if you ask me . Watching over some containers is a pretty easy gig , considering where we 're headed . Besides , I don 't mind checking the exists , making sure they 're locked up good and tight . I wouldn 't want the side of this bad boy to blow open . Any idea what we 're hauling ? - Uh . Equipment , machinery parts , samples . - General hodgepodge of stuff they 'll need . Yeah , more or less . Well , it makes sense , I guess . - I still can 't believe this is really happening . Yeah . So , what do you guys want to do now ? Backrubs , maybe ? State your name , your region , and a brief reason as to why you should be selected . Hi . I 'm Vivian Colfer from region 3c . I 'm a people person . I love interacting with others . As such , I think I 'd make a great team member . Would you consider yourself stable ? Yes . Marshall Clayborne from region 6a . I am a leader . I 'm not afraid to do what 's necessary . No matter what that may mean . - Do you consider that mindset a strength ? I do . I 'm Dawn Nevil from region 3c . - And why do you think you would be an asset to this endeavor ? That 's quite the question . What good is anyone , really ? I mean , when you truly look at it all . Do we need to do something about her ? No . She 'll stick to our decision . And how do I know that ? You know , I will not let her ruin this for me . For us . You don 't have to worry about her . She 's not going to say anything . Yeah ? What if she does , huh ? Then what ? Trust me . She won 't . I 'll take care of it , all right ? Please calm down . You don 't know her as well as I do . - No , I don 't know her as well as you do . I don 't know her at all . Hell , I don 't even know you . Just ... Trust me , okay ? Fine . But you watch her . I don 't want her wandering off alone . Ah ! Ah ! What ? He was right there . What , Dawn ? Is somebody screaming ? What happened ? He was there . He was right there . - Marshall ? Who ? - - Who ? It 's not ... Who was where ? Honey , what is going on ? Dawn . Let 's just take care of that hand ... no ! What ... It 's fine ! - Dawn , let me help you . - - No ! Dawn ! You only get one shot at it . I almost had a breakdown waiting for the results . Yeah , but it 's worth it . Well , you hope it will be . Are you kidding ? Of course it is . We 're talking about earth here . The earth . Do you know how many people pass that test when they reach maturation ? How many ? Eight percent . Thank you . Eight percent . How long have they been rehabilitating it , anyway ? 320 years ? 360 . - And this year , we 're the best and the brightest . And we 're gonna save the world . Literally . It 's kinda beautiful , right ? In its own way . - I wonder what an earth apple will taste like . The same . Better . What if we can 't take it ? The shock , I mean . Why couldn 't we ? Well , think about it . We 've been on Mars for 30 years . It 's all we have ever known . Can you really imagine seeing a blue sky ? Or a tree ? What if it 's too much ? We have trees back home . She means a real tree . Something that came into existence on its own . Not some lab plant . So ... Should we talk about last night ? How 's your arm doing ? Dawn , you can talk to us . There 's nothing to say . You just seemed upset is all . And we 're trying to understand that . I told you . There 's nothing to talk about . We 're not trying to drill you , but we are concerned . That was pretty weird . I just thought I saw something . But I didn 't . Well ? Well , what ? What did you think you saw ? - Dawn ... - Nothing ! I saw nothing ! Are you satisfied now ? - I 'm actually the first member of my family to get accepted into the program . My mom was ... So proud of me . If I could take anything me . She cried for two days , but she said it was just because she was so happy so ... - You 'll be able to travel back sometime and visit her , right ? In theory . But people never do . Some say they will but , I 've only heard of a few who really ever have . I-I don 't blame ' em . Who would want to ? Is that the deal with the autopilot ? It makes sense . How so ? It 's a seven day trip , and they only schedule a few a year . It 's a pretty long layover . Um . What about you guys ? Any family ? Yeah . I have a wife , Tonya . Baby on the way . And you 're leaving her ? Of course he is . It 's earth . You know the rules as well as I do . She hasn 't reached maturation . How old ? 28 . So , that 's only a couple more years . Still can 't imagine leaving though . - I didn 't think I was ever gonna get to 30 . She 's smart . I know she 's gonna past those tests . And then , we will be together . Besides ... I tried to stay . And she wouldn 't have any of it . What 's your baby 's name ? She doesn 't have one yet . I 'm supposed to think of one in transit . And then send word back when we land . Humph . She said she wanted her to have a earth name . That 's sweet . What about you , Dawn ? Nope . It 's just me . I think I 'm gonna go take a shower . Yeah . I should do my rounds . Check the cargo hold . But uh , stay close , chief . I don 't want to get stranded up here . It 's a little ... It 's a little isolated for me . Night lighting activated . Hey Dawn , you still awake ? As such , I love interacting with people . As such , I think I 'd make a great team player . Hey Marshall , are you guys ... guys ? You doing a late-night game of conquest ? You know , if you win though , just let me know . I know you guys can hear me because there 's only so many places we can be here . Do you consider yourself to be stable ? Marshall ? Hey , Dawn ! Dawn ! Dawn ! Marshall ! Marshall ! Dawn ! Oh god ! My foot ! Guys , please ! Help me ! Somebody ! My name is ... My name is Vivian Colfer . Guys , leave me alone ! Run ! I 'm right here , Vivian ! Help me , somebody ! Vivian , we are right here ! It 's okay ! God ! Hold her ! Calm down , Vivian ! Vivian ! Calm down , Vivian . Is she okay ? I don 't know . That ought to sedate her for awhile . Marshall . What 's going on ? - If selected , this endeavor could prove extremely stressful . Being launched into unknown surroundings of such difference in nature has proven difficult for some . Would you say that you 're psychologically sound ? Yes . I would . - Is there any history of mental illness in your family that we are unaware of ? No . None . None that I 'm aware of . Conquered . Oh ... Ha ha ha ! Dammit . You were right . She is good . Yeah . Yeah , she is . Best in the district . Well ... I tip my hat to you . You are indeed very , very clever . Sorry , region 6 . You 're not gonna be able to keep up with this one . She 's quick . Yeah , yeah . We 'll see . So , what about that drama in eight ? You mean section 8 ? Yeah . Yeah , I heard stuff here and there . Just seemed really crazy though . What things ? You didn 't hear about it ? No . What ? - Some family 's claimed that their son was killed during the revive project . And it was covered up . Covered up ? - Yeah . Said his son was used as a test subject . Guinea pig . That 's what he was . Yeah , but that 's what people claimed . It was never confirmed . - Oh yeah , but there were a lot of crazy stories . Apparently , he was working in what was supposed to be a radiation-free zone . - He didn 't know he was in a dangerous area ? Well , that 's the thing . They say that they sent him in on purpose to see if it was human-ready . That 's horrible . - There 's nothing to back it up . All right ? It was just some rhetoric from anti-revive groups . Maybe . Maybe not . Please . It was just some stupid rumor , probably started by some loser trying to stir the pot . Oh my gosh . To think of that worker , being sent in to ... it 's just one story . Yeah . Yeah . He 's right . I 'm sure it was an accident , or something . We know revive 's a great organization . - You know , people like to make excuses but , sometimes things just go wrong . That they do . - How about a subject - changer , hm ? Let 's have a toast . Nice . I concur . Well , what are we gonna toast to ? To ... New friends , and a new journey . To the revive project . To earth . Earth . Charley . I 'm sure you 'd hate that . Two years . Hey . Hey . Wow . That 's amazing . Yeah . Rain forest . Can you imagine seeing something like that ? I really can 't . Me either . There is still so much we don 't know . And I know it sounds stupid , but sometimes I wonder if earth is even real . How do you mean ? - Just seems a little too good to be true , doesn 't it ? Maybe a little . - Everything in here just seems full of life . Can you think of anything like that back h ... Back on Mars ? I think I understand . But we know that earth is real . We 've seen the video , the photograph ... yeah , I-I know all that . I just hope it 's what I think it is . Are you afraid ... We 're going to get off this ship and see a dead planet ? I really hope not . Look , we 've been waiting for this our entire lives , yeah ? Well . Once we step off this ship , the truth is gonna be staring at us in the face . And I don 't know ... I don 't know what to do if it 's not ... What I need it to be . Vivian . I know that you have been let down before . But I also know that no matter what happens when we leave this ship , no matter what we see , we will be together . And I promise you , I won 't let you down . You just have to believe . It 's just been a long journey . But , better if you smile , right ? Then it 's like the whole thing never happened . Lights . Tonya ? T-Tonya , is that you ? No . This isn 't , this isn 't real . This can 't be , this can 't be happening . I missed you , baby . This can 't be real . But it is . - No , no , no . This can 't be . No , it 's ... You 're ... Not ... You 're not ... Oh my god . How did you get here ? I 'm so sorry , honey . What are you talking about ? I didn 't , I didn 't know what to do . I didn 't know what to do , and I was so scared . And you weren 't there . What is it ? Why weren 't you there ? Why did you do this to me ? I-I don 't understand . Don 't you see ? Oh my ... Oh my god ! T-Tonya ! Lights , please . Thank you . Everything looking good ? Yep . I 'm finishing up my rounds right now . How 's the habitat ? It 's better . Just a couple small tweaks and it will be back to 100 % . All right . Thanks for checkin ' on it . See you in a bit . Parts container 413b , check . Specimen container 587g , check . Parts container 2 ... lights . I said , lights ! Please . Marshall , can you read me ? Marshall ? Hello ? I need you to come out here . Marshall ? Come in . There 's somebody down here . Daddy ? Daddy , is that you ? Yes , sweetie , it 's me . It can 't be . You 're gone . It 's okay . You 'll understand later . Just know that I 'm here right now . Am I going mad ? Of course not , darling . I have missed you so much . But I don 't understand ... How this could be happening . - You don 't have to worry about that right now . It 's gonna be okay . Your mother sends her love . Is she coming too ? No , she couldn 't make it . Just me . Look at me . My little darling , we are so proud of you . What you and your friends are doing , it 's just ... Wonderful . I 'm so scared , daddy . - I know you are , but you don 't need to be . You 're going to help so many people . Without you , they won 't be able to get back where they belong . Back home . What if I 'm not smart enough ? You 're smart enough for ... Four people . You 're destined for great things . I promise . Do you believe me ? Good . You can trust me . Daddy ? Daddy . Marshall . Sorry . Sorry . I got caught up with something . Uh huh . You guys ready to get started ? Never been so excited . Please remember to take this as seriously as we did our test . We 've still got a lot to learn . Absolutely . Hit it , miss efficiency . - In case you haven 't heard it enough by now , we are all very proud of you for your commitment to the revive project . Out of the ashes of many , you have risen . Now that you have begun your voyage to earth , you are privy to new information . Once you arrive , you 'll be integrated into our system and given partial access to our research . But with that , comes new responsibilities . There are some things we rejoice in sharing with our fellow man . However , some things are best left untransmitted back to Mars . Certain bits of information may be difficult for the general public to digest . Such as the case in any endeavor . Especially in one of this unprecedented magnitude . Therefore , during the first year of your journey , you will not be allowed to phone your contacts back on Mars . You will be allowed to send written messages , which will be screened by project specialists , guaranteeing that no sensitive material is included . After a full year , you will be evaluated and given video conference privileges once you 're deemed 100 % devoted to the cause , and to the sensitive nature of certain facts . Think of this , not as a restriction , but as a display of discipline . Never forget , you are one of the chosen few who gets to live on earth . Welcome . What is this ? Well ... It seems a little shocking , but it really does make sense . It 's just about keeping private information private . A year , Dawn ? That 's a hell of a wait . Control . They can manipulate what we do , and what we say . It is not that big of a deal . They , they just want us to make sure that we understand that what we say has a really big impact on people back home . That 's bullshit , Dawn . We have a right to speak freely . They can 't take that from us . What do they got to hide , anyway ? I have family that needs me . And I 'm supposed to send a fucking letter ? I 'm gonna go talk to him . No . Just let him go . We 're cramped in here enough as it is . It really isn 't that big of a deal . I understand , but ... Just give him a chance to breathe , okay ? Just give her some time . I 'm not going down there and dragging her up by the hair , Marshall . Well , we 've got to do something . What is it you propose we do ? See ? She 's fine . What 's going on ? We were hoping you would tell us . What ? - Marshall tried to reach you , and you didn 't answer . Now , he wanted to go get you . I said you probably just wanted some privacy . Privacy ? We heard you crying . - As long as you 're okay , I guess it doesn 't really matter . Just make sure you answer the next time we call , alright ? Sure . Yeah . Why does it seem like there 's something else you want to talk about ? Well ... While we were waiting on you , Marshall and I were saying that we ... - that we need to talk about what 's been going on around here . Like what ? I don 't think there 's any denying that Vivian had some kind of episode the other night . And I 've seen some strange stuff , myself . And I 'm betting that you have , as well . - We just all want to get on the same page . Maybe , between the three of us , we can figure out what 's causing some of this . What do you want from me ? I don 't know what 's happening . What about you , Vivian ? Why don 't you walk us through your experience the other night ? I already told you . I couldn 't find either of you , and so I searched the place . And next thing I know , I 'm pinned to the ground . - But we were right there with you the whole time . We were screaming your name , and you , you just weren 't responding . - You 've mentioned those things , a few times . But it doesn 't change the fact that I couldn 't see or hear you . How could you not hear us ? Look , it doesn 't make any sense , Vivian . I don 't know , Marshall . What about you ? What 's happened to you ? I 've seen things . Things ? People . A person . Who ? It doesn 't matter who . Who did you see ? It doesn 't matter who I saw . Who did you see ? My wife . Okay ? I-I saw my wife . That 's impossible . Yeah . No shit . Look , it just , it doesn 't matter what I saw . It was just some kind of illusion . It wasn 't real . Dawn ? Have you seen anything ? No . I haven 't seen anything that wasn 't real . All right . Everyone be aware that something is happening . Keep your eyes open for anything that 's out of place , okay ? There 's got to be something that explains all of this . This endeavor to restore earth to its full strength is one that will require trust . Do you feel you are one that can be trusted ? Absolutely . I do . Can you be trusted to take orders and do what your superiors ask of you without hesitation ? - I will do whatever it takes to help bring us all home . Do you think you 'd be able to trust your teammates unconditionally ? Unconditionally ? That 's a pretty big commitment . I 'd do my best . Would you say you have trust issues ? I 've been hurt by someone I trusted . So , I guess I 'd say it 's complicated . Have you been able to recover from that experience ? Recover ? To move forward . I haven 't had much choice but to . Do you have problems trusting people ? No . I don 't think so . Do you think you are someone others can trust fully and without hesitation ? Yes . Whoa . That is strong coffee . You think that 's strong , you should try the stuff my dad used to make . He always said it would put hair on your back . That 's attractive . Sorry , I don 't know why that was funny . It doesn 't matter . Are you still looking through that thing ? Yeah . Why ? Is it against protocol ? No . No , it 's not . It 's just that you 've had the same amount of training that we 've had . I don 't understand what it that you 're gonna get from that that you haven 't already learned . I like looking at it . It gives me an idea of what we 're gonna see on earth . But why not use a database ? Why use an actual old book ? I just like it . - Yeah , but the resolution would be so much better on an aid monitor than it is in that printing . I 'm not worried about the quality . Look , this is vintage . Somebody on earth used to read this exact book . This feels special . Is it worth somethin ' ? Mm . Not really . I like his body armor . You know those are scales , goofball . - You think Marshall could take him in a fight ? I think he 'd be ripped to shreds . Yeah , very funny . Well , what else you got ? Um ... Whoa . Oh yeah , that one looks cool . Uh . Think so ? Mm hm . Gives me the creeps . Yeah . Does anybody else want anymore coff ... are you guys all right ? My leg . Marshall ? Oh , shoot . Oh , shoot . Can you move it ? Yeah . We have to check for damage . Oh my god . I 'll be all right ... - no , your head ! - I look at it later ! What happened ? I think we hit an asteroid . I thought the autopilot was supposed to map a path around those . - It does , but if it wasn 't large enough , it doesn 't have time to reroute . - Uh , showing potential impact to the coolant system and cargo hold . I 'll check the coolant system . Okay , I got the cargo hold . All right . I 'll check the deck . Lights . Lights . Oh , come on . Did you guys find anything ? No . Nothing in the control room . Vivian . Yeah ? What about you ? - Uh . The lights are acting a little funny , but other than that , nothing that I can see so far . All right . One of you get up here and help me out with this . We got a leak , and if we don 't deal with it , the engines are gonna overheat . On my way . Please shut ! Shit ! Vivian ! Are you okay ? Open the door ! What happened ? Please ! Dawn , move . - Vivian , what 's wrong ? - - Vivian ! Why were you screaming ? Calm down . It took my breath away . Brought me to tears . You know , I was a crying , shaking mess for a good five minutes . Just to realize that it was real , that all these things we 'd ever heard , and all the stories ... It was real . And it , it 's just more than you could ever imagine . It 's been hard , you know . I spent my whole life with them . I love them . I miss them . But I feel like they 're really proud of me like , I 'm a representative of our family to this place . And , um , your teammates become your family , too . The people I work with , they 're my new family so , they make it bearable . - Yeah , I 'm not sure anybody really knows what they 're getting themselves into . I mean , how could you ? I 've seen some make the transition just fine . While others ... Don 't adapt quite as well . Being here is amazing . It 's hard to understand unless you see it for yourself . I am ... Blessed to have this opportunity . Unfortunately , for some of the others , they have ... Well , the reverse reaction . The vastness of it . The ... Awe . It 's too much for some people to comprehend . They fall apart . I 've seen it happen . After life under a dome , for some , it 's just too much . You have to be strong . Otherwise , you will never make it . You 're all gonna die . Hey . There you are . You alright ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm just doing some research . How 's your head ? It 's fine . Okay . We 're getting ready to eat dinner . All right . Okay . Well . Well ? Are you going to explain it to us ? Explain what ? I already told you what happened . Yeah . That 's my point . You 're trying to feed us some crazy horseshit here . Marshall , calm down . You just expect us to believe ... - calm down . - - No ! No , I want answers ! Well , what do you want me to say ? I don 't , I don 't know why any of this is happening . I don 't know why I saw what I saw . I just did . A giant spider . Yes . I was in the hallway , and it was just ... It was suddenly right behind me . Vivian . Maybe you just think you saw something . Maybe you were sleepwalking . No . I wasn 't sleepwalking . I ... I know what this sounds like , but I know what I 'm saying . It was right behind me ! And I ran as fast as I could , and it was , it was there ! And it was real . You sound like an insane person . Look , we 're gonna have to do something , or you 're gonna put us all in jeopardy . You 've seen things too . You told us yourself , you 've seen things . Did you forget that so easily ? - I laid down to sleep , and I saw something . The more I think about it , it was just a dream . Just some kind of vivid nightmare . Okay . So , when it 's you and the wife , it 's just some dream . But I 'm probably gonna jeopardize the whole thing . You know , maybe you 're the crazy one . - Maybe we should lock you up ! - - Calm down , guys . Calm down . - Listen to me , you smart ass ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop ! Just stop . She 's not alone . Neither of you are . I 've seen things too . Things . Hallucinations ? No . They weren 't hallucinations . He was real . Who was real ? My father . System malfunction . Something 's wrong . What ? Th-the alarm ! What alarm ? What do mean , what alarm ? The one that 's going off ! There 's no alarm , Marshall . You 're imagining things . That 's bullshit ! Look , I can hear ! What , you think I 'm crazy now ? Okay . Look . Look , it 's the coolant system . Do you see ? That 's not showing any problems . There 's nothing wrong . Wait , why don 't you just go lie down for a ... don 't touch me ! You are wrong . You are wrong about the cargo hold , and you 're wrong now . Marshall ! Come back and talk to us . Let 's just calm down . - Don 't you fucking tell me to calm down ! All right ? Oh my god . The cargo hold . What about it ? There 's something in there . How would you handle adversity , if it were to arise ? Adversity ? If problems arose between you and your teammates , how would you react ? I 'd try to smooth things out . I suppose I 'm usually kind of a calming force when things go wrong . - Do things often go wrong when you 're around ? How would you act in a violent situation ? Well , I 'd act swiftly . Resolve the conflict . Without anybody getting too badly hurt . - And if the matter was of higher consequence ? Well , I 'd eliminate the threat . If it were one of your peers endangering others ? I 'd eliminate the threat . How are you with facing altercations ? I 'm not a fan , but I can do what I have to . - Have you ever been in a physical altercation ? Once , when I was younger . How young ? Around nine . A family member tried to hurt me . I was able to fight him off . I 'm sorry . That must have been very difficult for you . Yeah . Difficult . That 's how I would describe it . - I have to do every damn thing around here . What the hell are you doing ? We got a pretty bad leak up here ! Marshall , there is no leak . What ? Stop it ! You 're going to ... shit ! You 're gonna overheat the engine ! You idiot ! No ! Yeah . We definitely had a , an issue like that on the trip . Uh , one of my crew mates broke protocol . And um ... She was having trouble dealing with it . It 's fiercely competitive here . I think it 's for people who want to trudge ahead , or somebody that wants to go further than they probably should go . Uh , I 'm one of those people . I 'm competitive . Uh , but uh , I 'm not willing to risk my soul for it . 100 % trust fully ? I probably couldn 't answer that honestly . It 's really not a choice , at this point , 'cause of where I 'm at . Can 't all coexist here . Some are survivors , while others ... Will only hold you back . That 's why you have to be so careful . You never know who 's comin ' for you . You have to be careful , Marshall . The others . They 're after you . Your leadership frightens them . Intimidates them . I 've seen it happen before . They will come for you . And they will kill you . Oxygen levels 100 % . Play birds . Shit . Guys . Yeah ? You 're gonna want to come down here . We missed something . - You know , I don 't ask a whole lot of you guys ... if you 'd unclench for five minutes . - You know , every time that I 've asked you to do something you just do a half-ass job . You were supposed to check on that after the asteroid hit . And I did ! Until you called me away to work on the leak . - Look , the whole point is just to check to see if there was any damage . - And I went down there , I checked the eternal wall , and there was no major damage . You 've done rounds since then . Did you notice anything ? Me ? No . I didn 't notice anything . - You mean to tell me that you didn 't notice that a bunch of cargo boxes had fallen to the ground ? I didn 't notice anything . Fine . Let 's just take care of it . Great . - And we 'll forget about the whole thing . What do mean , forget about it ? We report this back to Mars . We can 't do that , Vivian . What are you talking about ? We have contained cargo open on the ship . We report this to revive . Because if we do that , we might get sent back home . To the colony ? Yes . Why ? I 'm sure it 's standard protocol . That doesn 't make sense . Why ? He 's right . I 've never seen rock formations like that . Whatever they are , they must be samples from the explorer pods . So ? So , we could be contaminated . We 're not contaminated . I feel fine , don 't you ? Vivian . If there is even the slightest chance that we 've been exposed to some kind of airborne contaminant , they probably won 't let us see earth . There are lots of people back home that scored just as well on the test as we did . And they would send some of those people instead . You two don 't believe that , do you ? And what happens if they find out that we didn 't report it ? 'Cause I 'm pretty sure that 's protocol , and they will definitely send us back to Mars . We 're supposed to follow orders , remember ? If they find out about this , we will never see earth . Then we don 't say anything . Agreed ? Agreed . Fine . Okay , then . I 'll go clean it up . Can I speak to you for a minute ? Do we need to do something about her ? No . She 'll stick to our decision . And how do I know that ? You know , I will not let her ruin this for me . For us . You don 't have to worry about her . She 's not going to say anything . Yeah ? What if she does , huh ? Then what ? Trust me . She won 't . I 'll take care of it , all right ? Please calm down . You don 't know her as well as I do . - No , I don 't know her as well as you do . I don 't know her at all . Hell , I don 't even know you . Just trust me , okay ? Fine . But you watch her . I don 't want her wondering off alone . It 's the rocks . Marshall , it 's the rocks . It 's the specimens in the cargo hold ! There ... There must be something about them . Some radiation . They 're causing hallucinations ! This isn 't real ! Don 't you understand me ? None of this is happening ! Marshall ! Vivian ! Only we can see . Sweetie . Come be with me . This can 't be . Your mother misses you . Come be with us . You 're not real . Dawn , why won 't you trust me ? I can 't . No ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Let 's go . It 's okay . It 's okay . - You are trying to kill me , aren 't you ? - Marshall , why would I want to kill you ? Both of you ! No . It 's just your head . Come here . Pathetic . You 're so weak . And you call yourself a man . - A real man wouldn 't leave his pregnant wife at home to fend for herself . You make me sick . Anything else , muscles ? - You are trying to kill me , aren 't you ? - Marshall , why would I want to kill you ? Both of you ! No . No . Come here . Let me go look at your head , okay ? It 's not real ! Do you understand , Marshall ? It 's like before ! Marshall ? Stay away from me ! Stay away from me ! We better go after him . No . We 've gotta stay and take care of this or it won 't matter anyway . Don 't let him get away . Where are you , Marshall ? Marshall ? Let us help you , please ! Come on , Marshall , where are you ? Hi . Tonya . Hey , baby . Tonya . We wanted to come say hi . We ? Hey . Charley . Isn 't she beautiful ? It 's our baby . She looks just like you . It took so long to get here . We missed you so badly . Ch-Charley . Why can 't I see her face ? Well , he 's breathing , at least . Can 't see her face . Is he conscious ? I don 't know . Look at his head . Can we move him ?

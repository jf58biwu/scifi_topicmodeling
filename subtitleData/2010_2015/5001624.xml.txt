 This plan will restore us , and rid the world of the Observers . Previously on Fringe : The man came here and went down into the mine . His name was Donald . I don 't know any Donald . He was taken away against his will by two invaders . - Aah ! - You never know when to give up . Etta . No , no , no , no , no ... Why would we get her back just to lose her again ? Their abilities are aided by tech . I would be ten times what you are if I had that tech in my head ! Hello , it 's me . But you know that already . This is tape seven . I don 't have much time , so I 'll show you how to get the next piece of the plan and explain on the way . I am on Quincy Street , heading south . Hey , I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be late getting back . Didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file and then I 'm out of here , so I 'll see you soon . Hey , I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be late getting back . Didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file and then I 'm out of here , so I 'll see you soon . Peter ? Peter . How did you get here ? Monorail . You didn 't come home this afternoon . You weren 't answering your comm . Yeah , uh , I turned it off . I wasn 't gonna stay for that much longer . I just needed to see her . I 've thought about coming here too . I feel closer to her here . No , it 's okay . Play it . Play it . Hey , I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be late getting back . I didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file and then I 'm out of here , so I 'll see you soon . Peter , when you feel like this , I just want you to include me . It 's fine that you come here . Just tell me . I want to understand what you 're going through and you to understand what I 'm going through . You 're right . I 'm sorry . What is that ? When we collapsed the corridor , one of the Observers nicked me . It 's okay . I 'm fine . Here we are ... 167 Cedar Street . Now , we need to make our way to the fourth ï¬‚oor . Apartment 413 . - Hopefully not run into this tyrannical- - You again . You 're a friend of that renter up on four , aren 't you ? More of a colleague- - I don 't know what you 're doing up there . If I hear any more strange noise , I 'm calling the super . Do I know you ? I need to get into apartment 413 . Is it occupied ? Fourth floor has been red-tagged for 20 years . Nobody goes up there . - Hey , what 's your business here ? - None of yours . Walter ? Walter ? Hey , I was wondering where everybody was . Have you seen Walter ? No . Why ? I went in to wake him up . His bed wasn 't slept in . He 's not in the cold storage . He also left the amber laser on and on the floor . The tape we were working on last night is already out of the amber . I think he left . He knows not to go out alone What the hell is he thinking ? At the moment , lam on Quincy Street , heading south . The Red Line to Worcester / Union station . - Whatever mode of transport ... - He 's gone off to follow this tape . He 's retracing his steps ? I have created , or rather we have created a unique and efficient hiding place for a critical piece of the plan to defeat the Observers . It is undetectable to the Observers ' instruments . As I have mentioned ... May I help you ? As I 've mentioned , I 've had experience with transversing parallel universes . What we 've done is opened a space in the membrane that separates the two universes . A pocket universe , if you will ... This is very important . Do not , under any circumstances ... Is that raspberry filling ? Raspberry . Is it- - ? Two ... Now since the pocket universe exists in inter-dimensional space many of the usual laws of physics won 't apply . There are few places where two plus two does not equal four and this is one of them . It can be quite disturbing . Try not to worry about it . This tape will guide you every step of the ... Here we are , 167 Cedar Street . - Cedar Street . That 's downtown Worcester . - Fourth Floor . Apartment 413 ... 167 is in the Q9 District . - That neighborhood has been bombed out . - That renter up on four ... It 's mostly abandoned . - Hi , Walter . - Take this my arms are getting tired . - Donald , get a shot of this . - Donald ? Make sure it 's wide enough . - The name of the man ... - ... waiting for Walter 21 years ago . - Yeah . Your eyes are not deceiving you . The effect is caused by light refracted off- - Well , never mind , that 's not important . But down here- - These lines denote the trans-dimensional demarcation . They 'll prove useful . You will need to refer to them . Donald , would you leave the camera with me- - ? I realize , whoever you are , that this must seem very complicated . It is , extremely . But don 't fret . It will all become clear once we 're safely inside . The sequence goes like this : Now . Kick out 90 degrees to the right back two meters , and then to the left and pivot 210 degrees to the left and step out . What happened ? step out . Is it damaged ? I don 't see any grinding or flecks of amber . Maybe they just stopped recording . Well , it doesn 't make sense . I mean , if Walter 's gone to retrieve whatever it is that 's in this pocket universe why would he go alone ? I don 't know . It 's not like him . Not that way . Are you Donald ? No , I 'm Cecil . How did you get here ? Do you know how to get out of here ? Yes , I do . And you 'll never know if you keep threatening me . How did you end up here , Cecil ? I was in one of the apartments . The resistance must have been in the area , because the in- - The invaders hit the whole block with light bombs and- - And last thing I remember was a flash and then I woke up here . You were blown into here . The force of the explosion of the light bombs must have blown you here . Which is most likely why you 're still alive . When did this happen ? I 've been here for five days . Five days ? Well , how have you survived ? There 's no food here , no water . There 's water . Show me . It 's mine . If you hope to ever get out of here , you will show me . - Sure this is the right place ? - I 'm sure . Don 't worry . You won 't fall . I 've managed almost half a cup every night . Something behind this wall . Perhaps some kind of refrigeration unit . That 's what 's causing the condensation . No , I 've been all around this place , every which way . There 's nothing on the other side of this wall . I 'd like to look for myself . Follow me . I 'd like to know how you know your way in and out of here . Because I 've been here before . I just can 't remember it . I 'm surprised he made it up there . Walter 's full of surprises today . Walter ! Walter . I thought we were leaving . - Not until I find what I came for . For a while , I thought this was purgatory . What have you done to deserve that ? The apartment I was in wasn 't mine . I was stealing things . Wouldn 't have been there otherwise . What could be worth stealing in those bombed-out apartments ? They weren 't bombed out when I got there . You 've been here five days ? Yeah . Those apartments are condemned . The building was blown up 20 years ago . - What year is it ? - It 's 2016 . - It 's 2036 . - What are you talking about ? Perhaps in some way , you are in purgatory . This is a pocket universe . Time and space loop in on themselves here . So you can 't get out . And that 's why it just seems like days to you . My wife is waiting for me . Not anymore . Let 's go . Look at these footprints . He was here . He must have gone into the pocket . - Kick out 90 degrees to the right ... - There 's only one way to find out . ... back two meters , and then to the left . And pivot 210 degrees to the left and step out . How are we doing ? Am I in focus ? - Not yet . - I 'll Wail ' . Look . Back in the lab , it went to black . It was the end of the tape . We 're ready . But now there 's more footage . - How is that possible ? You are now in the pocket universe . Don 't be alarmed . You will notice that things work differently here . You will see a door . Go through it . You 'll see a long hallway . - Turn- - Left , Walter . Left . Thank you , Donald . Looks like something Walter would 've designed while he was tripping . Follow me . What you 're about to find is very important . Captain Windmark , I 've just been alerted . Walter Bishop has been sighted in Quadrant 9 . - You are certain ? - Yes . And now , reaching the hallway , turn right , not left . If you continue on to where the hall you 're in dead-ends ... you will find that it 's not a dead end at all . - Are you getting this , Donald ? - Yes , Walter . It doesn 't look like the camera 's recording . - It 's fine , Walter . - But the light 's not on . - Wait , no , now it is on . - He 's right . This way . - Walter , wait . - What 's wrong ? Why aren 't you coming ? Oh , dear . - Are you afraid ? - They 're not alone . There 's nothing to be afraid of . - He 's talking to somebody else . - Someone besides Donald ? Yeah , look . His eyeline is different . Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There ? This place is like that . Walter ? - There 's nothing in there . - Walter . Olivia . Peter . - Wait there . - Walter . You 're not supposed to leave the lab alone . I 'm so sorry . I don 't understand . All I thought about was retrieving that tape . I couldn 't think about anything else . All I cared about was finding the next piece of the plan . - Is that Donald , Walter ? - No , that 's collateral damage . That 's Cecil . He 's completely irrelevant to the plan . - What 's he doing here ? - He ended up here through a series of unfortunate events . He was blown here by an explosion . When ? Twenty years ago . For him it 's been days . Everything within this pocket wraps in on itself , including time . That 's why we have to hurry and find whatever it is I hid here . Walter . There 's more on the tape . You can 't see it until you enter the pocket . Of course . The time anomalies wouldn 't allow the camera to operate properly . Let me see . The key is to know what you 're looking for . In this case , we ' re looking for the apple the forbidden fruit the root of all knowledge . It will mark the place where you 'll be staying for what I promise will be a short time . Then it will be safe and comfortable I assure you . Who is that ? You honestly don 't recognize him ? He must have been wiped from my mind , like the other parts of the plan . No , Walter , it was a case that we worked . The boy , he was living underground . A demolition site . Maybe Walter didn 't experience the case in the same way that we did . Is he one of them ? An Observer ? At first , we thought that he was just a boy . But then he started to exhibit empathic abilities . - He helped us find a murderer . - An empath . Remarkable . - Why would I need an empath ? - I don 't know . It was 20 years ago . But not for him . Like Cecil , to him , he 's only been waiting for days . Like I said on the tape , we used this place to hide him to keep him safe until someone could return for him . Press play , Peter . Show me more . We 're nearly there . Now , we ' re looking for an apple . This one . Look up , Donald . These markings , they 're very strange . Of all the things we 've seen in here , Walter , that 's what you find strange ? There 's the hand . Wow , wonder where it could be . Ah . Ha , ha ! Here we are . Ha-ha-ha . There it is . Just wait here now . Donald , please . Here it is . He 's not here . Where is he ? Where is he ? We designed this room just for you . And you must stay here and wait for us to return and get you . Uh , for us , it could be quite a long time but for you it will seem like no time at all . There . Heh . Now you see where we 've kept him . To understand his purpose , refer to tape eight . You definitely left him here . - Cut . Maybe Donald moved him . It has been 20 years . Walter , I think this is a portable air-degradation unit . So he was an Observer . What difference does it make ? He 's gone . Do you understand ? He was a part of the plan somehow and without all of the parts , the plan is useless ! Calm down . - No , it 's too late . They must have gotten this out of my mind . Wind mark ! He must have found the boy . Everything we 've done is for nothing ! Nothing . Walter . Search parameters remain the same . Building to building door to door . There you are . If the Observers had known about this pocket they would have shut it down a long time ago . The only person other than you that knew this place existed and how to navigate it , is Donald . That makes sense . But why would he move the boy ? I don 't know . Maybe he thinks you 're dead . We were missing for a long time . And you have no idea who Donald is ? Where you met him ? Nothing ? No . We have to find him , Donald , whoever he is . It 's the only way we 'll ever know for sure . Walter , Peter , I think I 've got something . It 's not there . Did you see this radio anywhere in that room ? - No . - Whoever took the boy left this behind . - Purposely ? - Mm-hm . The batteries must be dead . Or it doesn 't work in this pocket . Like the video camera , things work differently here , so once we get it outside ... Of course . That 's brilliant , Olivia . And perhaps it will somehow help us get to Donald . Assuming he 's still alive . - So we get out of here ? - Please . Aw , come on , guys . Walter , we have to move . Back down the stairs . Go . Go ! Stop . This way . That 's it . You found it , Peter . Olivia , cross right here . You okay ? Yeah . Olivia . Move . There 's no time . Get Walter out of here . I 'll draw them off and meet you at the monorail . Go ! I know what you have done . You have made a grave mistake . You do not realize what is happening to you . Clear the walkway . The doors are closing . I think that 'll work . Thank you . Clear the walkway . Walter , he 's not coming . We gotta go back for him . Peter . - How 'd you do that ? - Do what ? Get us out of there . How 'd you find your way back to the portal ? I don 't know , but I 'll take it . Please take your seats . Yeah , that 's what he said . What 's wrong ? This radio was left for us in the pocket universe . Look , the tuning dial has been jammed . It 's , like , stuck on one frequency . Why ? Nothing 's being transmitted . Not yet . You okay , Walter ? I can 't stop thinking about that man . All he wanted was to get out of there . And I didn 't help him . I didn 't care about him . - All I cared about- - - Saving the world . Walter you are not responsible for that man 's death . He died 20 years ago . The night that he broke into that apartment and the light bomb went off . If it wasn 't for your pocket , he would have died then and there . Perhaps . I saw a man ... half-starved and I used him because it suited me . Because he was nothing more than an acceptable loss as long as I got what I needed . Is that who I am , Peter ? Is that something you can see coming from my mind ? From my heart ? Am I the person that would leave in the middle of the night on his own ? Walter ... Those are the actions of a man of hubris , arrogance . That 's not me , Peter . It 's him . Him ? Don 't you see ? I 'm not safe . It 's my mind . Ever since the pieces of my brain were re-implanted it 's been changing me . Back into the man I was before . Bit by bit . I 'm losing myself , Peter . I 'm losing the man that you helped me become . Listen to me . I 'm not going to let that happen . We need you . You are our only hope to defeat the Observers . And I 'm gonna be here with you every step of the way . Please , son . Whatever happens don 't let me go . I won 't , Dad . I promise .

On May 15th , strange ash suddenly enveloped Hokkaido . From there it spread across the Tohoku region . This is Aoba shopping street in Sendai . Things are out of control . Get out of here now . The situation is ... Those without gasmasks were infected by inhaling the ash . They became comatose immediately . After an hour , antler shaped tumours sprang from their foreheads . They began attacking and eating people . An estimated six million were stricken . Thirty-six hours later , it drifted into the Sea ofJapan and dissipated . Japan was left with six million infected human beings . Security unit 3 reporting . I 've found something strange . To contain the problem , a wall was built from the Pacific to the Sea ofJapan . It ran along the borders ofTokyo , Chiba , Yamanashi , Saitama , Ibaraki and Niigata . Japan became divided . With people evacuating Tohoku , Tokyo exploded , the city became overcrowded . Life became hell for its residents . It 's unlike anything I 've ever seen . The bill to classify the infected as dead didn 't pass . Protect the Infected The infected still retained human rights . Families ofthe infected formed human rights groups . They fought to protect the infected . I don 't consider the infected to be deceased . They are human . We must extend to them the same rights that we do to all . Protect the afflicted . Protect our beloved families . Fathers , mothers ... Our children they need our help . It 's impossible . She has no heart , yet she lives . Public Announcement 1 household , 3 Family-System . We 're strangers united together . We have a new law . Happiness first for our Japan . 'The infected are human .

Their vital spot is here . The horn . It contains an unknown substance . If ground into powder it acts like an illicit drug . Just say no . Horn harvesting prohibited by law Hey , hey . You there . That 's illegal . There 's gonna be trouble . Horn material is unstable and volatile Hatoda administration is trying to kill us . Japan is for the living . We must shelter them . The infected are dead . They 're monsters . Human rights for the infected . 1-household , 3-families homicide . What happened to the 3-family system ? A 3-family system , right ?

Kamikaze Orphanage Hayama - Chiba - Nakamura Former Kamikaze After the north and south divided , my father began to help troubled children . He started an orphanage . He said , ' I am Kamikaze . ' He got eaten by an infected kid . Utterly lame Kamikaze . After he died , the kids scattered . He 's what 's left . His parents were eaten and the shock left him speechless . He says nothing . Seems he has a sister up north . I want to help . But it takes money . Prime Minister Hatoda As long as they walk on two legs , they 're human . No matter their state , they 're not dead . I will never tolerate just getting rid ofthem . Justice Minister Osawa But the country is divided . Japan 's power is fading . Public order is breaking down . Unemployment and crime are rising . If this goes on , other countries will take advantage of us . Guaranteeing those things human rights will destroy Japan . Eradicating the infected population and taking back the overrun land is priority . The bill you 've submitted , it 's legalisation of murder . It is not . It 's a guarantee of the right to life for the non-infected . Even if it were , it will not be approved . Chiba Amazing , it doesn 't even hurt . Frickin ' good pudding , sis . Caramel is the shit .

It 's an experimental android that will reduce the number of infected . Reduce ? You 're ignoring their rights . Have you no respect for human rights ? I can 't authorise this . Do not appropriate the country . Excuse me , sir . How 's the experiment going ? - Excellent , sir . It proves effective against the infected . What 's the prime minister 's schedule ? There 's the speech in front of the wall . Now is the chance . Put the plan into action . Yes , sir . Progress report : ' Go Go Yubari Law' Boss Ando ... How about a little more today ? The important thing now is , how do we live side by side with the infected behind this wall . They are human beings afflicted by a rare disease . To declare them dead without proper medical treatment ... Is itjustice ? We have but one choice . As they are human , we must treat them humanely and coexist together . Girlie Bar - Gape at their Buns They are human . I pledge to protect them . Let 's live together . Let go . Shoot them . I can 't . They 're human . These things aren 't human . They 're zombies .

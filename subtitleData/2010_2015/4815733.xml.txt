 Clearly , I 'm in the wrong place . All the people that I know and love are somewhere else . You are showing up in my dreams . How is that possible when I 've never seen you before ? In the dreams , did you feel like you knew me ? - Did you feel anything ? - You 're a stranger , so what would I feel ? His name is David Robert Jones . He was looking for a mineral , amphylicite . If you process it , it can be a power source . - You get a lot of bang for your buck . - How much bang ? Enough to blow a hole in the universe . I love you . Do you love me ? I do . Then tell me . I want to hear you say it . I love you . It 's Peter . Sorry , I know it 's early . Did I wake you ? No , that 's okay . What 's up ? Me and Walter for the last 24 hours . We 've been working on the machine . - Did you make progress ? - We had a breakthrough . Could be the first step towards getting me home , but ... - But ? - There 's something I need your help with . Gently , gently . The trick is to ensure optimal heat distribution while not allowing the mixture to separate . - Olivia , you 're just in time . - What is that smell ? Walter is creating a new breakfast Hot Cinnamon Roll . Did you know that the cocktail was historically conceived as a morning beverage ? The entomology of the word itself , " cocktail " ... What 's in it ? Oh , boy . It 's mostly cinnamon schnapps and butter but right now , it 's mostly butter . - Needs more butter . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just a little bit tired , that 's all . What did you need my help with ? Peter and I have completed interface with the machine . The device is uniquely calibrated to work only with Peter 's genetic profile . It uses an organic interface to transcode Peter 's neural impulses into command directives . - Just watch . You 're able to control the machine with your thoughts through this ? That 's how I was able to do it back in my timeline . - Click your heels and think of home ? - We haven 't worked out how that works . That 's how I ended up here in the first place . So , in theory , yeah . We won 't know for sure until we 're able to test the prototype of the machine itself . Which would require Broyles ' authorization . Now I know why I 'm here . - You don 't mind asking him , do you ? - Of course not . I 'll see what I can do . I have crazy dreams Check it out . - Did you see that ? - What is that ? Over there . What the hell ? Is the phone working ? I have crazy dreams I 'll get Walter online . - Welcome to Vermont . - Thanks . - So , what brings us here ? - Atlantic 591 was passing overhead when a disturbance occurred mid-flight . Their electrical and hydraulic systems failed . Walter ? I 'm sorry , I can 't seem to reach him . - Any survivors ? - None . NTSB is currently working the crash site two miles south . - Walter ? - Whatever caused the crash originated in this location . - On what basis ? Approximately three hours ago , every vehicle on this highway inexplicably lost power . - Could be some sort of interference . There any high-frequency radio towers around ? None . That wouldn 't explain some of the stranger events described by witnesses . - Objects suspended in mid-air . - Are you getting this ? Can you hear me ? Walter ? For God 's sake , woman , lower your decibels . - You 're here , in person . - Thought it was a nice day for a drive . Well , let 's get started , shall we ? Well done , convincing him to leave the lab . Don 't look at me , this was his idea . Guess he finally got tired of being caged up . Yeah , but it 's not just that . He 's been much more open lately somehow . Peter , look at this . Walter , what are you doing ? This car belongs to someone . Just watch . - Huh . It 's magnetized . - As I suspected . I didn 't think that those levitating effects that the witnesses described was a result of a change in gravity . On the contrary , it seems for a moment the electromagnetic force in this area was increased dramatically . Which is why all electrical systems failed . - And probably the plane 's , as well . - And was strong enough to leave a residual magnetic force in all metal objects in the vicinity . - Do you have any idea what caused it ? - No , not yet . I 'll need to take some samples before I can develop a proper theory . But I will require some of the plane 's wreckage and the black box . Go ahead and collect whatever evidence you need here . Agent Farnsworth and I will coordinate with NTSB to take custody of the wreckage and the bodies . Peter . While they 're collecting the samples , just down the road I saw a sign for a place that serves delicious , homemade rhubarb pie . Who 's hungry ? There . - " The best in Westfield . " You see ? - Damn it . - What 's up ? - I can 't get a signal . Gonna hit that payphone on the corner , see if I can get an ETA from Astrid . - May have to get the rhubarb to go . - We 'll meet you in there ? All right . Tonight you 're mine completely Come on in out of the cold , gentlemen . Have a seat . What can I get for you ? Your largest slice of rhubarb pie and coffee , please . - All right . And for you ? - Just the bathroom . In the back there , first door on your right . Thanks . - So where you folks from ? - Boston . Ah , it 's a lovely city . Got an uncle out in Somerville . - First time in Vermont ? - Are we in Vermont ? I had no idea . - Are you folks lost ? - Not that I 'm aware of . How does a man drive from Boston to Vermont and not even know that he 's there ? - I 'm not allowed to drive . I haven 't renewed my license since I got out of the mental institution . You know what ? I like you . Pie 's on the house . Oh . Thank you . Hey . Looks like June got you some coffee . How 's your evening going ? Excellent . - And yours ? - It 's fine . So , what can I get for you ? - Pardon ? - What do you wanna order ? But I ordered a moment ago . This is my busiest shift . You wanna order or not ? But I did . I ordered rhubarb pie . And you even offered to give it to me free of charge . - You trying to steal food ? - No , of course not . Nobody steals from me . Not you , not Cliff , nobody . You hear me , old man ? I hear you . I hear you perfectly well . Oh . Still gotta get you that pie . Must have forgot . I 'm sorry about that . Please . Please . And there you go . Anything else I can get for you ? No . - Thank you very much . - You 're very welcome . Peter ! No ! Walter ! Peter . I 'm okay . - What happened ? - I don 't know . There 's a guy in the back room . I think the cook attacked him . He was pretty beat up . Thank you . Come on . Pulse pressure 's weak . Probably a result of the puncture in the arm . An inch to the right , it would 've hit his brachial artery . I just found another body behind the counter . - Thinking serial killer ? - I don 't know . There 's something off about this town . - Meaning what ? - The whole place is deserted . I can 't get a cell signal . The phone lines are down . We can 't call an ambulance ? - You can 't treat him here ? - He 's lost too much blood . Unless he is administered fluid , resuscitation and a blood transfusion he may not make it . - The nearest hospital is 20 miles away . Then let 's get moving . Grab his feet . Where am I ? You 've sustained some injuries . We 're going to get you to a hospital . - No . No , we can 't leave . We ... - You 're going to be all right . Stay with us . What 's your name ? Cliff . Cliff Hayes . - Did you see that ? - " Welcome to Westfield . " - You must have gotten turned around . - I guess so . Stay on the main road . It takes you to the highway . I thought I did . - What the hell is going on here ? - It 's not possible . We can 't leave . We can 't leave . We can 't leave . I think our friend 's right . We 're trapped here . Hello ? FBI , anyone here ? Lay him down here , Peter . His pulse is dropping . We have to start the blood transfusion immediately . - With what , Walter ? - See if you can find a first aid kit . There might be an IV . I 'm O-negative , so I can donate . Okay , the phones are out here too . Walter , why can 't we leave ? It 's got to do with what happened on the highway ? I 'm not sure , but I 've seen this once before . Where ? Brigadoon , the musical . A magical town in the forest where no one can leave . Of course , that quaint Scottish village was more hospitable than our present locale . - Come on , Walter . - I haven 't formed an hypothesis at the moment , my concern is keeping this man alive . - I found an IV kit . - Good . Could you put pressure here , please , and over here ? Now prepare two needles . We 're not safe here . This town , everyone 's crazy . It started three nights ago . My sister woke us up . She was frantic . She was so scared . A man had broken into her house . I tried calling the sheriff but the phones were down . So I went over . When I got there , I found her husband in the bedroom , shot in the head . Point blank . - The intruder killed him ? - Not the intruder . Her . She said she 'd never seen him before in her life . They 'd been married for 18 years . - So the effects are amnesic ? - Not exactly . She was delusional . She was talking about people she had never met . Things she 'd never done . Children she didn 't have . It was as if she was having memories all of a sudden from someone else 's life . The symptoms you 're describing , it resembles schizophrenia . I know it well . Except , it wasn 't just her . It was everyone . So how can an entire town turn schizophrenic overnight ? Some biological contagion ? A virus that affects the human brain ? A virus doesn 't explain why we drive out one side of town and right in the other . No , this is something else . What else can you tell us about the symptoms ? Most got sick right away . Others took longer . Hours , a day . But it always started the same way . First , confusion , forgetting things . Tremors . Some of them became paranoid . Others turned violent . Like our friend at the diner . A few of us who are immune are at the high school including my wife and daughter . That 's why I went to the diner , to get them food . They need supplies . But what they need most of all is hope . Knowing that the FBI is here might give them that . We need to find a way to contact Broyles and let him know what 's going on . I did find radios out back . I can send a signal but I need an elevated place and something to boost the power . There 's a generator at the high school . - What do you think ? - We 're gonna need a few things first . I think there 's a military base about 50 miles from here . Think the Army 's involved in this ? I mean , something of this magnitude , a whole town ? Perhaps it was a military experiment gone wrong , like that case in Edina . - Where 's Edina ? - Upstate New York . The whole town 's population was disfigured from the military experiment ? We never had such a case . I investigated a case in Edina , with my Walter and my Olivia . Oh , right . Right , I must have read it in your debrief . Peter , now I don 't consider myself to be a violent man , per se but given the danger of our present predicament I think it would be best if I had one of those . - Pepper spray ? - Just remember , it shoots that way . Oh . You ever use a gun ? - I 'm a teacher . - Okay , red button , safety . Come on . Okay , let 's go . - What 's that ? - Shh-shh . You guys hear that ? We gotta get out of this town . - Come on . - It won 't start . The increase in electromagnetism that caused the cars to lose power on the highway must be present in this town too . - It was working when we pulled in . - Effect must be intermittent . We can wait , but we have no idea how long it will last . - I see the resemblance . - Pardon ? Agent Dunham said his name is Bishop , like yours . - He 's your son , isn 't he ? - In a fashion , yes , you could say that . - You all right ? - Yeah . It 's just my arm won 't stop shaking , that 's all . - Whoa . Whoa . What 's the matter ? - No , I 'm okay . I 'm just a little bit dizzy . - Do you need some water ? - No , because ... I don 't know how to explain it , but that feels like there was somebody else in my head . Here . Take this . I 'm scared that what 's happening to other people in this town is happening to me . Open up , it 's Cliff . Cliff . Who are they ? The FBI , Brian . I 'll explain inside . I thought you were dead . What happened ? Long story . How many people do you have here ? - Twelve of us made it . - Eleven . - Teresa . - When ? This morning . Locked her up in one of the empty classrooms . - Couldn 't take the chance she 'd hurt us . - Daddy ! Girl . - Oh , my God . I thought you were ... - No , no . I 'm here . I 'm here . We gotta tell Walter . If you think what 's happening to these people ... - ... is happening to you ... - So FBI , huh ? - Where 's the rest of you ? - Uh ... - They 'll be here soon . - We 've been trapped for days . Our downtown 's destroyed , our friends , families everyone 's going crazy , and the government sends three people ? I understand that you have questions , but all I can tell you is that help will come . Now , we need to work together find out what 's going on and also how to get out . If I examine one of the victims , we might get answers to what 's happening . I heard that one of your party went insane . May I see her ? Teresa . You 're the man from the government . You 're here about our air quality . - The air quality is bad here , isn 't it ? - Hm . May I ? - Hm . Fascinating . - What is it , Walter ? I 'm gonna need to take a blood sample . The cook at the diner had two irises in each eye . Perhaps whatever is afflicting these people is creating some sort of rapid mitosis causing the cells to replicate exponentially duplicating body parts . I 'm going to ask you some questions , Teresa . I should start supper . Lee 's going to be home soon . Her husband , he passed six , seven years ago . So when was the last time you saw Lee , Teresa ? This morning . I packed his lunch before he went to work . And what did you and Lee talk about this morning ? Is this a joke ? Some sick joke ? I 'm sorry ? My Lee 's dead . Seven years this April . I should start supper . Lee 's gonna be home soon . How did it go ? Did you get the radio to work ? Couldn 't get a signal . Even if I had a generator twice that size there 's just too much electromagnetic interference . I think we 're stuck here for a while . What 's wrong ? That woman , Teresa , her husband died seven years ago and yet she thinks she talked to him this morning . Let Walter test your blood too . It 's the only way you 're gonna know for sure . They 're probably just psychosomatic , these symptoms you 're feeling . You were always very empathetic , even as a child . That 's why you 're a great investigator . You emphasize with the victims . That 's all this is . And if it 's something worse , then we 'll deal with it . I need to go and examine this . Well , I 'm glad you 're here . Not just for me , but for him . I 've seen the way he 's been with you lately . Before you got here , he was kind of shut down and isolated . He 's a lot like my Walter , this one . - What 's she like ? - Pardon me ? The other Olivia . I 'm just curious . I don 't know , she 's ... She 's driven . She 's very , very stubborn . She doesn 't like to lose . But she sees the best in people , even when they don 't see it in themselves . When she first found me I was trying to scam two Iranian businessmen . I didn 't picture you as the scamming type . Well , that 's what made me so good at it . It was all supposed to be temporary . She told me I had to babysit Walter while he was working on a case then after it was done , I could leave , go back to my own life . Despite , of course , how gorgeous she is . Well , you 've got good taste . She gave me something that I hadn 't had since ... Really , since my mom died . She gave me a place to call home . A place I 'd wanna call home . Eventually , we even had our own thing . - A thing ? - Yeah , a thing . A routine , you know ? We 'd get together , watch cheesy horror films and order in from Damiano 's . Heh . You ever been ? No , but I 've driven past on my way home . It 's good . You should check it out . - Well , she 's lucky to have you . - Aah ! Oh , my God . No ! - What happened ? - I don 't know . I just found her like this . She got loose somehow . I don 't understand . She was fine when we got here . If it happened to her , what 's to say it 's not gonna happen to us ? - And why hasn 't anybody come ? - We 're all gonna be okay . We need to figure out what 's happening and find out how to get out . They shouldn 't even be here . I 'm sorry ? Last fall I was offered a teaching job in Philadelphia . Angela wanted me to take it . I convinced her to stay . I think deep down I was scared to leave here . This town is all I 've ever known . If I had just taken that job , my family would be safe now . Maybe . But you are here . And if it weren 't for you , they might not have made it this far . Would Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop please report to the biology lab at once . Olivia and Peter to the biology lab . Thank you . Peter ? Olivia ? I think I 've worked out what 's happened to this town . When I examined Teresa 's blood , I found 92 chromosomes in her DNA . That 's twice the genetic material that should appear in any human being . How is that possible ? Belly and I once combined a tiny portion of our universe with the alternate universe , in a goldfish bowl in our lab . Besides what it did to the goldfish the effects on the physics in the overlapping areas was catastrophic . Gravity , electromagnetic fields ... What you 're saying is the two universes merged together . I 'm afraid I am . These two circles represent the respective universes . And this overlap is the town . Now , for reasons that I am yet to deduce our Westfield has merged with the Westfield from the alternate universe trapping the three of us in the overlap . Well , how can two universes merging drive an entire town insane ? Maybe the same thing is happening to the townspeople . They 're merging with their doppelgangers . Which explains why Teresa thought her husband is alive and dead at the same time . Can you imagine being flooded with years of experiences and memories that were not your own ? The mind unable to distinguish between what 's real and what is not . Okay , well , can it be reversed ? Sadly , no . I am afraid the damage is done . - So , what are you saying ? That Olivia ? - What ? No , Olivia 's blood was fine . - Did I fail to mention that ? - Yes , you left that part out . You 're perfectly fine , dear . Now , as with all of us , it stands to reason that Cliff and the other people here do not have doppelgangers at present in the town in the alternate universe . Cliff said that he turned down a job offer in Philadelphia last fall . In the alternate universe , he must have taken the job and moved his family . - Could any of this happen naturally ? - I don 't see how . When Belly and I merged just a tiny portion of the universe the energy required was tremendous . I can 't imagine an energy source that would merge an entire town . What about amphylicite ? Yes , that would do it . You think that David Robert Jones is involved ? Maybe that 's why he was at the quarry , mining amphylicite to do this . But why ? I mean , to what end ? Of course , if my theory is correct , it presents a more pressing problem . The effects I have just described , they are just phase one . What 's phase two ? Agent Dunham . You need to see this . That is phase two . Lacey , come on . Come away from there , honey . - Daddy , what 's happening ? - It 's gonna be okay . Go with Mommy . I just don 't know what to do . The two towns have merged together creating excess mass and energy in the overlapping regions . The fundamental forces of physics are colliding out of balance , destroying everything . - Isn 't there anywhere we 'll be safe ? - No . Two things cannot occupy the same space without dire consequences . Both towns will be destroyed and all of us with them . There 's nothing we can do . There 's nothing we can do . Maybe you should go and talk to him . Me ? Well , I 've seen how you two are together and he seems to respond to you . Walter . There must be something we can do . You said that the forces of nature are colliding . Do you think they could be offset by opposite forces ? Yes , yes , yes . The sum of equal and opposite vectors is zero . That 's very clever , Peter . We need to find the place where the opposite forces meet and cancel out . - Like the eye of the storm . In a hurricane , the center is said to be the safest . After this is done , it may be the only place that survives . Of course . We need to find the true center of the merger . While you do that , I 'm gonna get us a ride . Come on . We need to get to a place where we 're gonna be safe from the destruction . - Where ? - Well , we 're working on it . But we 're gonna need vehicles to transport us there . Now , we know that the phenomenon affects electronics so any fuel-injected engines won 't work . We need older cars , any running models from the 1970s . Two , maybe three , to transport everyone safely . I might have a better idea . Drove out of town here . And we entered for the first time here . Cliff said the first building to fall was the bank here on River and Highway . Right , so in order to find the bull 's-eye ... Connect the points . Divide in half construct the perpendicular bisectors . And extend to find their intersection . Center here . - Cypress and Quimby . - Cypress and Quimby . We think the center is gonna be right there . It 's Cypress and Quimby . That looks about four miles from here . If Peter 's theory is correct it will be the only thing left standing when the town collapses upon itself . Need a ride ? Hang on to me . Mommy . - Mommy , I 'm scared . - Where am I going ? Okay , Cypress and Quimby . Do you know that ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . There 's a bike shop there . Don 't cry , dear . We 're going to a safe place . You 'll be fine , you 'll see . Peter . Nice shot . - Okay , is everyone all right ? - I think we 'd better get moving . Okay . That 's not moving . Okay , everyone . We 're on foot from here . Make sure you stay together . Come on , run ! Go , go , go ! - That the last of them ? - Yes . Come on ! - Hurry up ! Let 's go ! Come on ! - Lacey . Daddy ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Everybody inside ! Walter , what are you doing ? Come on . Get inside . Peter , you were right . - This is it . This is the eye of the storm . - Great . We 'll be fine . We 'll be safe here . Understood . Coordinate with COC and keep me apprised of any changes . - Anything ? - Search team 's just checked in . They scanned the entire area . No other survivors . - And it gets worse . - How ? During the search , we found several unusual devices . Not sure how the technology works , but they were placed around the town . David Robert Jones . HAZMAT detected trace amounts of amphylicite . What would Jones have to gain by destroying a town that people didn 't know was here ? I don 't know . But the amount of amphylicite recovered is only a fraction of Jones ' stockpile . Sir , we 've got Director Norris . Go home . I can take it from here . Hey . How is Lacey holding up ? Just a sprain . She 's fine . She 's strong . And how are you ? My home , everything I 've ever known how do they just disappear ? I wish I knew . Even if you did , you probably wouldn 't be able to tell me , right ? The Bureau is gonna help you with temporary housing until you get back on your feet . Well , we have each other . No matter what happens , we 'll face it together . Beautiful . - See you tomorrow . - You 're leaving ? But I 've made crepes . Breakfast for dinner . Second most important meal of the day . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . Take a rain check ? - Of course . - First thing tomorrow . Maybe by that time , Broyles will have allowed us access to the machine . Yes . We can resume our efforts to get you home . Peter ? Good night . Good night , Walter . I 'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on a bed Of California stars I 'd like to lay my weary bones tonight Hey . Come in . Hey . I hope you don 't mind . I thought I 'd stop by and see how you 're feeling . No , why would I ? I 'm gonna pour you a drink . What is that that smells so fantastic ? What do you mean ? It 's Friday . I ordered Damiano 's . Heh , heh . Whoa . Olivia ?

 He had this on him . Hi . What ? Where 's the girl ? What girl ? Where 's the girl ? I don 't know what this is about . It 's about a kidnapping yesterday in Brooklyn ... You have the right to remain silent . And the stolen car you dumped downtown but not before you took it across the Williamsburg bridge and got your picture taken , so I ask you again , where is the girl ? You 're crazy . You have the right to speak to an attorney before you speak to the police . You 're lucky your boy gave you my knife . Oh , this does belong to you , huh ? Here . Take it . If you can 't afford an attorney , one will be provided for you . Knowing and understanding your rights ... Where 's the girl , Lucas ? Told you ! I don 't know no girl ! Do you agree to answer my questions without the presence of an attorney ? Where is she ? Man , I don 't know ! You listen to me . A ten-year-old girl named Denise Matthews was taken somewhere by somebody . Now , if it wasn 't you , I guess I 'm just getting my exercise here . Now , where is she ? I can do this all night . I know what happened to you . I read your file , Lucas . But this doesn 't make it right . Tell me where she is . You want to use that ? Go for it , do it . You want to take that shot ? You were hurt , so hurting helpless people gets you off , so get off . Come on , stab me , stick me , do it ! Be strong . Come on , cut me . I 'm helpless ? I 'm helpless , I 'm defenseless . I got my hands in the air . Come on , hurt me . Hurt me like you hurt those little girls . Do it , Lucas , do it ! Come on ! What are you waiting for ? Do it ! Do it now ! Lucas ! - What ? - RST317 . RST317 . What is that , a license plate ? RST317 . Is it here ? Lucas , is it here ? Is it here ? License plate , RST317 . Start here , go , go , go ! RST317 . It 's a license plate . License plate ! - RST317 . - Check the SUV on the right . What the hell is wrong with you ? You cannot do this . Suspects have rights . We read him his rights . I 'm running out of patience , Bob . Being called out of bed in the middle of the night will do that . Now , I know things haven 't been easy for you , but I 'm not gonna let you take me down with you . RST317 , I got it right here , guys . This behavior stops tonight . You were saying ? Hey , man . Are you really a cripple ? You tell me . Coming through . Coming through , coming through . What do you got , Ed ? Annie Ryan , 26 . Columbia undergrad , Stanford MBA , magna cum laude . Grew up in Wilkes-Barre . Worked at Mullen Financial for about two years . There was a celebration last night for some big deal . They found her this morning . Apparently , it was a hell of a party , 'cause no one even noticed she was gone , much less lying dead in the street . Close out a kidnapping last night , and this morning , they give me a jumper ? Police Plaza asked for you personally . Who do they owe a favor to ? Someone big , but people are watching , so do yourself a favor on this one and give me a break . Yeah ? Who 's gonna give me one ? Oh , you mean other than your huge settlement and reinstatement , your own building , a handpicked team of detectives ? Hey , none of that was given to me . I took what was rightfully mine in a court of law . - You know that , Ed . - Yeah , I know too much . What do you got for me , Hlly ? Even for parties and other events , you need a key card to access this roof by elevator . - Stairs ? - Unlocked , no cameras , so yeah , there could have been someone else up here . Tracey ! Come here ! Hey ! Son of a bitch ! Ah ! That 's for making us chase you ! Come here . Come here . Ah ! Oh , man , don 't do this ! We 're looking for Enrico Gonzalez , Tracey . - I don 't know , man ! - Where is he ? - I don 't know ! - Where is he ? I don 't know ! Man , don 't do this ! Running out of pants , baby . Hey , I 'm getting hungry , Bobby , drop him already . - Come on , man ! - Man , we just ate . Look , you can 't answer if you 're screaming , - right , Tracey ? - Look , I don 't know , I swear ! Just tell him ! Just tell him ! Come on , man , I never met him , I swear ! Drop his ass now . Drop him ! Sergeant . Sergeant . Robert . Virgil and Teddy are down at Mllen . It 's such a tragedy . She had a big future here . She was supposed to leave next week to close a huge deal with our London office . She seemed excited about it . They say it 's the ones you least expect . Who says that ? Um , it 's just a ... And why would you least expect Annie ? And what huge deal ? And what ... What do you guys do here ? We 're investment advisors . Oh , so you tell people where to put their money , and you get paid whether they win or lose , huh ? Pensions , life savings . We work mostly with institutions . Some private clients . I 'm sorry , we have - some clients coming soon ... - How did she seem excited ? About this huge deal , how did she express this excitement of hers ? I mean , it was an important moment in her career . So you mean she should have been excited . She was always very positive in meetings . Yeah , who was she close with ? You mean here at the office ? Or family , friends . I think she had a sister . Anyone having sex with her ? So you ? That 's out of line . No . No ? No , what , never , ever ? What ... what are you , one of those ... No , I ... one of what ? I 'm gonna go take a look at Annie 's desk . That 's okay with you , right ? Give me the rundown on Mullen Financial , how it 's doing , what it 's doing . And dump her hard drive , I want to see who Annie was doing business with . I vowed never to set foot inside an investment bank again . Why , ' cause you get your trust fund money delivered to your apartment ? Hey , do I have to call your wife and tell her - you 're acting up again ? - Enough . She was thinking about running a marathon . See if she has a trainer . They 're the new bartenders for people who don 't have time for a shrink . But toss her apartment first . - Take Teddy with you . - I can handle it . Yeah , but who 's gonna handle you ? Track down her family , especially her sister , and get me the M.E. ' s first impressions . Got it . Why can 't you two be more like her ? - Hey . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , Bob . How are we doing ? - Closing out the suicide . - Good . And opening a homicide investigation . Pass it . Pass it ! Pass the puck ! No ! No , get a ... Everybody bring it in . What the hell , guys ? Pass the puck . You look for your off wing . Listen , guys , our first game is in less than a week . What are you guys doing ? You ... you guys are really pissing me off . Three-on-two drills , let 's go . You heard him . On the red line . - Three-on-twos , let 's go ! - Make it happen . What do you got for me ? M.E. says there were traces of nembutal , alprazolam , and alcohol in her system . No obvious suggestions of a struggle . Really ? Annie 's sister will be here in the morning . She was already booked on a train from D.C. Supposed to be spending a few days visiting . Hey , hey , Nate ! Get over here ! This is supposed to help you relax . I 'm relaxed . Hey ! We 're not a demolition team . This is how I search . Do me a favor and never lose anything in my house . I don 't even know where you live . Yeah , exactly . A lot of pictures of her sister up here . They must have been close . So why 'd you quit being an accountant ? Investment banker . Family must have gone crazy , huh ? The truth is , they have no idea why I became a cop , because it 's none of their business . Yours either . This doesn 't feel like the home of a cutthroat broker . Still got Teddy bears , for crying out loud . Places like Mullen are mid-level , fighting for the scraps the big guys leave behind . That kind of pressure cooker will toss you from teddy bears to Tequila to a whole lot worse in a heartbeat . - You think she jumped . - When the market crashed , there wasn 't a person in the business who didn 't think about jumping . Boss says it 's a homicide , it 's a homicide . That 's how we proceed . Teddy , come here . - What do you got ? - Not sure . You know what these are ? Yeah . Took her work home with her . Yeah , a mother 's dream . Oh , except these aren 't supposed to leave the office . Hello . Looks like she skipped from teddy bears right to a lot worse . Oh , boy . Wow . Got something for ya . And ? What do you think ? These are called " Flower parties . " Rich guys bring their wives to play " Caligula , " only they already slept with each other 's wives , - so we ... - Stock the pond ? We stock the pond . The black girl went to work for the Albanians , so it 's probably one of their parties . Albanians ? You got a name ? No , but I could look around and get you one . - Thanks , darling . - You 're welcome . Tell Angie I 'll see her at the engagement party . Take care , take care . So what 's Annie doing at an Albanian sex party ? From the pictures we found , looks like a little bit of everything . Isn 't it possible life in the big city got to her ? Drugs , pressure at work , and she actually took the dive ? Hey , how ' bout I run the case and you do your job ? - I am , thank you . - What else you got ? Amanda Roush was Annie Ryan 's trainer at the gym . Kim eliot worked right next to Annie until January , when she left Mullen financial . No one will say why . I 've been going through the journals , but not much yet . All right , I 'll take the trainer , you take the ex-Mullen employee . Virgil , really ? Another one who wants to run the case ? Virgil , if she won 't return our calls , track her down , wait . - Sir ? - What ? - Rachel Ryan 's here . - Annie 's sister . Our parents died my freshman year at Duke , and Annie covered my last three years tuition . Then , when I decided to go into relief work , she shouldered my loans . Said it was her way of balancing the scales for her work . She must not have been too happy at her day job . Oh . I don 't think she liked her boss too much . Well , a lot of people don 't like their boss . Ask my team . I don 't think ... she liked the way the company was run , the kinds of people she had to deal with . What kinds of people ? Rachel , what do you think happened ? I don 't think she would have killed herself . She was too strong . Always stronger than me . I found this on her desk . It 's okay , I don 't think forensics needs it . Thanks . Sure . Just like that . See , it 's easy . - Amanda Roush ? - Be with you in a minute . - It 's important . - As soon as I 'm done . I 'm so sorry to hear this . I liked her . So how long did you train Annie ? - About six months . - Anything you can tell us ? I just know from my own experience that you tend to spend a lot of time talking to your trainer . For the most part , there are two kinds of people that need my help training for a marathon : hard-core runners , and ... - People who are just running . - Yeah . - Annie had demons . - Like ? I 'm not really sure . Although that boyfriend of hers contributed to a lot of her stress . - Boyfriend ? - Zamir Kraji , or something . - Albanian maybe ? - Some kind of thick accent . Sure , maybe . Well , it 's probably ... Thank you for your time . Zamir Kraji , it 's the police ! Oh , hey , Teddy , did you hear somebody cry for help in there ? Yes , I did ! - We got a body . - Clear . Zamir Kraji . He was 30 years old . OCCB 's got him for priors on drugs . M.E. says he 's been dead for three days . - So before Annie Ryan jumped . - Right . No print on the knife , but crime scene says we 'll get lucky just about everywhere else . Murder-suicide , maybe ? Zamir blackmails Annie with the picture , she kills him , thinks about what she did , then ... Two controllers , two pipes . Zamir was freebasing and playing Assassin 's Creed , but not with Annie Ryan . He wasn 't scared of Annie . But he was scared of whoever he was partying here with . How the hell 'd you see that ? I got a different view of the world from down here . - Rich . - Financial statement for what I 'm betting is a shell company . Guess who handled Zamir 's investments ? - Mullen financial . - So Annie was laundering her boyfriend 's drug money through Mullen . Yup . - Where 're you going ? - Home . In the middle of an active crime scene ? I 've seen all that interests me here . And I gotta knock the hell out of Bill Broughton tomorrow morning . Gotta save my strength . The biggest problem is , he 's not kidding . All right , we 'll get you guys next time , Bob . Yeah , you better bring an army , homeboy . Hey , Mel , you know , before you , he never brought anyone to our games . Oh , I had to go out with these two alone every game night . It 's like ... I married Starsky and got Hutch for a wedding present . That 's ' cause most women don 't understand the fine art of cross-checking someone 's face . Johnson 's bringing you down . He is on defense like he 's on a damn coffee break . I want to cross-check his face . Now , you ... you see why I got to marry her ? - Gary . - Yeah ? Tracey just came through with the restaurant where Gonzalez hangs out . Well , dangling a guy off a roof will do that . Hey , hey , hey . Let 's go lay eyes on him . Let 's go , come on , let 's go . - You good with a cab ? - Yeah . No , no , I didn 't ... Come on , man , let 's go ! - Hey , you . - Hey . What are you thinking about ? - Work . - Well . Hey . Mm . This might be work . Hey , just hold on . Just hold on , just hold on . Don 't move , don 't move , don 't move . Hey . Hey , girl . Detective Ironside 's phone . I think something 's wrong . Ironside . He begged us not to call his wife . You 're the only one he wanted to talk to . What 'd he do ? Put a garbage can through a window , then sent two responding officers to the hospital . Look , we all feel for him , and I 've seen this behavior before where partners are hurt , you know , or worse . What do I do here , ed ? I wish there was a simple answer . - Thanks for calling . - Get him home . You gonna straighten this out ? Nate needs you . Penny needs you . I just can 't . You got an incredible wife . That 's what matters . Get it together , Gary . Come on . - I don 't know how . - What happened to you ? You ... are you really gonna let one bullet take us both out ? You were my partner . I should have never ... I swear to God , Bobby , sometimes , I wish it was me in that chair . I 'm in this chair , and I accept my lot , but you ... you ... you 've become this emotional cripple . Stop crying and get back on the damn horse . You trusted me to watch your back . - It was my only damn job . - I don 't have time for this . I don 't ... I don 't have time for this . - What are you doing ? - I still have a job . You want to blame yourself , go ahead . I 'm not playing wet nurse to you anymore , Gary . You 're never coming back to the force . Get your looney bird pension and move on . Stop dragging this out . Let me live my life . Wha ... don 't you just wanna scream sometimes ? I mean , how the hell are you handling it so well ? I don 't have a choice . You found these where ? A dead drug dealer 's apartment . Shocking , just shocking . Had a feeling you 'd be shocked . I don 't think I like what you 're implying . I 'm not very good at implying , so usually , I go straight to accusing . Of what , that I killed Annie ? You think that I pushed her off the roof ? I think a lot of things about you . There were 20 or 30 people who would have seen me all night . Check the security tapes , I never even left the floor until I went home . Wow , you had your alibi locked and loaded , huh ? I don 't need an alibi . What kind of managing director lets one of his associates launder Albanian drug money through his own company ? Well , he 's either incompetent , or he was in on it . See , my guess is both , and I ... I would bet your trust fund against his that he knew exactly what Annie and Zamir were doing . Well , my guess is that he 'd take money from Madoff to stay solvent . His exposure on that London deal alone probably left him borrowing against the losses . Tell me about the flower parties . What ? The flower parties , was it a condition of employment ? I figure a box of Cubans and 18 holes isn 't good enough to close a deal these days , so you send your young , pretty , sexy employees to your old , saggy , sex-starved clients . I think we 're done here . You made him leave his own office . That was the easy part . Finding out why he left is another matter . Got a hit on partial prints off the game controller from Zamir 's apartment . Alek ... I don 't how you pronounce this , " Carchanie " ? Alek Carcani ? I got someone who put me in touch with the guy who sets up these parties . Zamir was a regular , Alek is his second cousin . Both of them grew up in the village of Borsh , in Vlore County . Came over together , arrested together , twice for mid-level drug moves . - You got an address ? - We 'll call it in on the way . Hi , Alek ! Go , go , go , go , go ! - You made him run . - Yeah , maybe . Virgil made you run , didn 't he ? Is it that hard to find cops ? Oh , the wheelchair . That 's not bad . It 's kind of funny . Think your cousin 's laughing now ? Hmm ? See , old me would 've bounced your ass off these four walls for opening your mouth to me like that , but new me ? I has a lot of time to sit and think , look past the knife at the photograph . 'Cause it 's really all about the photograph . Wasn 't it , Alek ? Hmm ? What you gonna do ? Yeah , I see you . I see you getting all hot inside . You want to jump across this table , don 't you ? Like you 're about to explode . I mean , even with both of ' em dead , wasn 't enough , was it ? - The girl 's dead ? - Yeah , Annie 's dead . So what did they do to you , Alek ? I mean , you and Zamir , you grew up together , got pinched together , got rich together , so what ... was it about Annie ? What was it about her ? I mean , did you want her ? Is that what it was ? Did you see her first ? I 'm done . I want lawyer . Did Annie ever mention a Zamir Kraji ? - No . - No ? He was her boyfriend ... for awhile . What about an Alek Carcani ? No . Do you think they killed her ? I don 't know . We 're finding out all we can . You know , it 's funny . Here I am thinking I was working in the most dangerous places in the world , and Annie , back home , was safe . The places I spend most of my time , I 've seen things . Casual cruelty , worse . Places where people don 't often get justice , and they stop expecting it . Are you going to find justice for my sister ? - Anything ? - Not yet . - I hope he 's still here . - He 's here . What the hell are we waiting for ? Come on , man , there 's still people eating inside . You know this guy will kill anybody in a heartbeat . We 'll just wait till he gets outside . Come on , come on , come on . There he is , there he is , there he is . All right , all right , all right , all right . Let 's keep our eyes on him , see where he goes . You got him ? You got him ? Gary , be cool , man . Be cool . - Come on , man , come on . - Gary , hold on . Hold ... hold ... whoa , whoa , whoa . Where you going ? Come on , be cool . Be cool . Go , go , alley ! Freeze , police ! Get down ! Down ! Get down ! Wheel house . - The picture was part of a set . - What do you mean ? The picture on Zamir 's chest of Annie , it 's from a different flower party than the ones we found at Annie 's apartment . Different parties , different pictures , multiple pictures , multiple parties . Okay , so Alek put the one on Zamir 's chest , left the others behind . Annie found them . Annie found Zamir dead . So how did Alek get the pictures ? Start from another direction . Start with why . Who 's there with you ? All of us , boss . Nobody went home . Good , put ' em on . Everybody there ? - Yup . - Yeah . Teddy , tell me about Zamir 's investments . 383 separate cash deposits , totaling ... Other direction . How did the investments do ? 2 million in deposits , current value ... 1.1 . Look at Annie 's face . That 's not a party smile , - it 's a work smile . - Okay , Annie meets Zamir at a flower party , they hook up , she convinces him to invest his drug money . Annie loses half of it . Zamir panics because it isn 't only his money , it 's Alek 's too . - Hides the statements . - Someone tells Alek and sends pictures as proof that Annie was involved with Zamir - and the money . - Yeah , but who ? Who ? Who ? Sarge , we 've got a more immediate problem . - Come on . - The last member of my family ! I have no one ! You don 't know what you 're talking ... Tell them , you lying son of a bitch ! Ma 'am , no one has gotten hurt yet . - Please , put the gun down . - No talking ! - Ma 'am , please . - He 's not getting away with it ! - Ma 'am , it 's okay . - He 's not ! It 's gonna be ... it 's gonna be okay . - Just step away from him . - You 're gonna tell them . Ma 'am , look this way , please . You 're gonna tell them the truth , and then I 'm gonna kill you . Please , put the gun down . Lieutenant , where are we ? Been going back and forth like that since we got here . From me , I have no one ! Tell them , please . I just want it to be over . - I 'll go . - Yeah , Sergeant , - I can 't let you do that . - What are you gonna do , tackle me ? Pin me down to the ground ? I 'm not gonna let you get shot . You 're two years too late . Relax , the Peace Corps worker 's not gonna kill the guy in a wheelchair . Come on . Stop lying ! Stop lying , you son of a bitch ! Gun ... by your side , behind your leg , and out of sight , 2 feet behind me and off my right shoulder . Say it . Yes , you did , just say it . - I swear on my life . - Tell them the truth . - He 's not getting away with it ! - It 's gonna be okay . No . No . - Rachel . - No , no , no , no . You had your chance . I am done talking to you . - I am done talking . - Rachel , Rachel . She changed . It wasn 't her . She wouldn 't do those things . She was terrified . Terrified of the men she slept with , - the men he made her sleep with ! - I didn 't ... I don 't ... - He ... - Bill , Bill , you might want to shut the hell up right about now . He 's gonna get away with it . I know he is . - Stop . - Men like him always do , just like all the horrible people I 've seen - all over the world . - Make her stop ! - I 'm not gonna let him , I 'm not ! - Rachel , Rachel , Rachel , what do you want me to tell you , that he 's not worth it ? - It 's obvious . - He forced her to do things ! - I did not ... - He forced her to do things ! - He made ... - Hey , no . He made her do things . He got her killed . No , no , no , no , no , no . No , it 's more complicated than that , Annie was more complicated than that . No one forced her to keep going to those parties . No one forced her to stay with Zamir , Rachel . She wouldn 't have done it if he hadn 't made her do it , - and now he has to tell ... - Rachel , it 's not too late . You haven 't gone too far . - Get this crazy ... - It 's not too late . You 're not getting away with it ! Get this crazy bitch off of me ! - You 're not getting away ... - Somebody do something ! - Say it , Bill , say it ! - Somebody freakin - do something ! - Say it , I 'm done now ! This isn 't going to work . Shoot Broughton in the leg . - Shoot the hostage ? - Did I stutter ? Get down on the ground ! Okay , okay , easy , easy . You 're okay . You 're okay . On what grounds are you holding my client ? You realize that we have a case against the city . You 're gonna sue a guy in a wheelchair because a Wall Street bottom-feeder got scratched while I saved a Pace Corps worker 's life ? - A scratch ? - You really want to compare bullet wounds with me ? Mercurochrome and a band-aid , boo-friggin ' - hoo . That picture of Annie and Zamir , that was yours . Was it a souvenir , or was it a bit of insurance ? - All right , that 's it . - My one detective who 's good at this forensic accounting stuff says that you were the one that took Zamir 's money off Annie Ryan 's terminal , loaned it to your huge London deal to cover your losses , and couldn 't get it back . And then , you tried to make Annie the fall guy , you tipped off Alek that she and Zamir lost your money , and then you aimed Zamir and Alek at one another . You figured one ends up dead , the other ends up in jail . But see , here 's the problem , I don 't have a homicide case for Alek . He goes free in an hour or two . What happens after that , when he hears that you stole his money and you set him up ? Unless ? Unless . Unless you give me a reason to keep him in jail , a money trail that I can " Rico " back to Alek 's drug business . This is completely theoretical . But you 'd have to offer us immunity . - Except I won 't . - What ? My offer is , your client takes himself down with Alek , confesses to money laundering . Think of it as adding a few years onto your life . Work on your squash game at Club Fed for five to seven years , hope like hell Alek dies in prison or finds God . If he doesn 't , then ... well , at least you got a head start . That 's not much of a deal . I hope you can run fast . I thought we did have the homicide on Alek . Of course we do . Alek left enough DNA on that knife to make a baby . So you lied . It 's best way to get a confession . - What about Annie Ryan ? - Well , Annie ... Annie killed herself . She knew that the drug money had disappeared out of Zamir 's account . Then she finds Zamir with a knife in his chest , pictures of her all over the apartment . She gets the hell out of there ... sits with it awhile , suffers , and doesn 't see a way out . Didn 't I say that ? Yeah , you were half right . Congratulations . Annie knew that bill Broughton was setting her up . She just didn 't want to be around to see her future in the cold light of day . I get it . When did you figure this out ? Ed , you don 't take off your jewelry to go to the roof for a smoke . She took off her locket for her sister . She knew someone was gonna find it . So you knew this was a suicide the whole time . What the hell have we been doing for the past four days ? Finding out what made Annie jump . And punishing the ones that put her on that ledge . Heh . I was driving . He was in the passenger seat . I dozed off for just a second and I ... I hit a tree . Walked away without a scratch . He ... died on impact . I hear that crash in my sleep every night . It 's my first time here , so bear with me . Uh ... I was a cop . Well , I guess I still am , and ... my partner and I , we ... we worked some pretty big cases . This one ... we tracked this scumbag for over a year , and ... it was dark in that alley . That ... it really doesn 't have anything to do with what happened . It ... it 's ... that 's the first time I ever said that . Hey . Hi . You stalking ' me ? I think I , uh , lost something in your apartment . Cops are very good at finding things . Well , some cops are better than others .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... My older brother , Christian , He didn 't beat up my younger brother . He was crueler than that . He made me do it . Throw him the rope , and I 'll throw you in there , too . Why isn 't there a nationwide manhunt ? He escaped from federal custody . Just wanted to make sure you got my present . I promised him a face-to-face with Coulson . I hear you 've been looking for this . The Obelisk . We share a common enemy ... a guy named Phil Coulson . Everything we 've been doing , it all ... leads here . It 's a city . Our job ... find it before anyone else . 2x08 - The Things We Bury Beautiful , is it not ? Your group was digging in the ground at night . How you found it is a mystery . Do tell us . We 've heard the same stories as you . Well , we 've both searched so long for a thing we barely understand . You can hold it , if you like . Please . Works quickly on this one . So , gender 's not a factor , nor race ... no pattern emerges . Fascinating . Put him with the others , then bring the next subject . Please , have a seat . Do not be afraid . Feel free to pick it up , examine it . Please . _ _ Discovery requires experimentation . Remarkable . What makes you so special ? I think it wise we prepare her for surgery . We must examine exactly what makes her tick . Herr Dr. Reinhardt , Red Skull has fallen . He 's dead . The allies approach . The world has lost a great mind . Put her in a cage . We 'll unravel this mystery later , yes ? Discovery requires experimentation , and this experiment will take time . With all of modern science and millions of dollars at your disposal , these are your results ? I 've had this information for decades . Bring him in . It 's time to prove your claim , that you 're an expert on this Diviner . And could have saved you weeks of work . Instead , you kept scratching and pawing at it like a monkey , expecting new results ... the very definition of insanity . Mr. Bakshi 's disappearance has everyone on edge . These men will remain in case your temper returns . Not necessary , I assure you . Cool as a cucumber . Smart to play it safe . Tell me what you do know , sir , and I 'll fill in the blanks . I know that a special few can touch it without suffering . But I have yet to figure out how this weapon can be ... Weapon ? That 's so small-minded . Uh , for someone with such a big mind . It 's a key . It can kill , sure , but only to protect itself from those it doesn 't divine ... hence the catchy name ... to be worthy . I 'm interested in science , doctor , not folklore . Worthy of unlocking its true power . Oh , I got your attention . There 's a place , and if one of those special people you speak of takes this Diviner to that special place , it won 't just kill . It will do something ... scientifically speaking ... much , much cooler . Subtitle by ~ pinkmei ~ I 'm unclear on how I 'm stuck running the base and you 're off to Hawaii . Don 't get too jealous . I doubt I 'll even see the tarmac . There 's plenty of work to be done . Ward 's till out there . Have you gotten a response from his brother ? He has his own men on the manhunt . We 're politically toxic , and he demanded that we stay away from the case . They 'll never find him . I 'll signal a few assets to be on alert . How 's Agent Morse handling Bakshi ? He wouldn 't speak for the first eight hours , but she 's working him . I 'll send you any developments . Aloha . Didn 't want to crack him yourself ? Bobbi 's as good as they come . My job now is to keep an eye on the big picture . And you found something to chase . Fury . I 've been thinking a lot about what made him such a good director . His communication skills ... flawed . But he could always see five steps ahead , which , for a one-eyed man , is impressive . He knew his enemies . And for better or worse , he could think like them . Whitehall has a weapon that 's unpredictable , but he 's not . I don 't want to be in a footrace to stop him . - I want to be waiting at the finish line . - Which is the city . That 's where I believe the Obelisk will lead HYDRA . We grow stronger every day while S.H.I.E.L.D. clings desperately to a world it no longer understands . - We will rip it from your hands . - I 've read the HYDRA pamphlet . Didn 't your mother ever teach you , if you 're gonna talk , say something . I could go back to being silent . Well , might as well if you have no thoughts of your own . I don 't understand how you can work for someone so ... - Call him evil all you want . - Nope . I was gonna say ... boring . She 's chipping away at him . It 's nice to watch someone else suffer for a change . You talk to anybody about what happened last week ? - A lot happens every week , mate . - Uh , with the director . You didn 't see what I saw . The guy was violent . Seems all right to me . No , no , he was out of his mind , man . And they 're saying it 's ' cause Fury messed with his head or something . I don 't ... Come to join the festivities ? Mr. Bakshi almost killed me a few times . - Well , pull up a seat . - I 'm surprised she 's so ... civil . Want to see his head bashed in ? That would be wrong , wouldn 't it ? But I could never sit across from him like that , smiling . Bobbi can pretend to like anything . How can you follow Whitehall ? He 's sort of a milquetoasty middle-management type . Now you ... you got that whole classic bond-villain thing going on . - Why not lead ? - My time will come . Like Whitehall , I worry about the long view . And I worry that you 've been brainwashed . Did Whitehall pull an MK-ultra on you ? I 'm not one of those fanatics that HYDRA controls . Dr. Whitehall is a disciple of Red Skull , HYDRA 's founder , shared his vision . I 'm part of a grand history . - Cut off one head and two ... - Two grow back . Yes , yes , yes . Hell , I 'll hand you the sword if Whitehall 's head will get you the gig . Whitehall will see your friends turn to stone ... - ... those that haven 't already . - Hmm . So , you think Bakshi was brainwashed ? No , but let the idea drive him nuts for awhile . Any HYDRA member could 've been , wouldn 't know it . Yes , that 's true . Oh . Something Bakshi said ... the language didn 't feel right . Called Whitehall " a disciple of Red Skull . " Weird choice . He didn 't say " studied . " And " shared his vision " ? That phrase is past tense . The wording feels ... - Firsthand . - Yeah . I think Bakshi slipped . Maybe Whitehall and Red Skull have some sort of connection . Sounds logical , other than the fact that Red Skull 's been dead for over 70 years . Which is right around the time the SSR recovered the Obelisk . Clearly , whatever Red Skull did to get the Obelisk influenced Whitehall . This used to be an SSR base before Fury restored it . - It 's full of SSR files . - Get on it . Like Coulson 's been saying , know your enemies . I 'm sorry , hon . I 'll try to make it home this weekend , but with the strategy meetings , it 's just ... Okay . Love you . It 's me . Yep . Wide open . My family 's summer place . Did you get my present yet ? Of course it 's see-through . That 's the point . Whoa ! Hey , big brother . Heard you were looking for me . What are we gonna do , storm Oahu ? - We don 't know yet . - Ditch the guns . Take this . - What is it ? - It 's a watch . Deliver it to Cam , the owner of the Kahananui repair shop . Here . It 'll need the following inscription ... " Dearest Darren , I count the seconds we 're apart . Love , your island flower . " You got that ? " Island flower " ... got it . Anything else ? If it starts to leak any fluids , drop it , run . This does not sound like a watch . Take this to the Ka Pua dry-cleaner on Makaimoimo street . - Maka-what , now ? - Not the one on Hookelewaa . Am I good with this in my pocket ? That depends . You ever want kids ? - And bring back the blue tie . - You got it , sir . Get back here asap . This bus has to be wheels-up in 40 minutes . - You got it . - Copy that . Any orders for me , sir ? You wanted to get back in the field ? Here 's your chance . It 's a ... transceiver , or at least parts for one . I 'm gonna need you to install this in the field , under pressure , in less than six minutes . You are aware that I only have one hand that works good . That 's why you 'll practice it over and over until you 've got it down cold . Muscle memory . Don 't think about the action . - Let the action help you think . - Yeah . Piece of cake . What 's wrong ? You 're twirling . Having trouble figuring out Bakshi ? Actually , no , I-I have him pegged . Grew up on the street ... probably Southall ... worked hard to refine his accent , still struggles with the t 's , parents weren 't around , got into petty crime , military straightened him out till they sensed something off and washed him out . Ended up a private intelligence contractor . And you got all that from the eight words he said to you . No . That last part I checked on . I think that he crossed Whitehall as an enemy , and Whitehall gave Bakshi a second chance . His borderline personality disorder makes him overvalue certain relationships ... thank mom and dad for that ... and one glimmer of belief in an authority figure like Whitehall , well ... Hail HYDRA . The puzzle I 'm working is Whitehall . Bakshi sees something in him that we don 't . I 've found decades of research , and it 's incomplete . But I did find the original 0-8-4 report signed by Agent Carter herself . - Anything on Red Skull ? - Did you hear what I said ? Peggy Carter , founder , happens to be British , held this in her hand . No . Anyway , um ... no Red Skull , but a lot of references to one of his commanders , Werner Reinhardt . Yeah , it says the Howling Commandos grabbed him and the Obelisk in ' 45 . Yes , and cites intake interviews , but all the important documents on him are missing . I question Coulson 's filing skills , to be honest . Vault D ? Not the only vault . Agent Carter buried a lot of things here . _ Werner Reinhardt . - That was a neat trick . - I 'm sorry . I don 't follow , doctor . It 's a pen . You wanted to see what I would do with it . After all , there are so many uses , no ? Escape , confession , homicide ... suicide . It 's true . I wanted to find out what kind of man you were . You didn 't use the pen , so now I know . Pens are also used for signatures . You want a deal . How terribly shocking . The U.S. Government has recruited many german scientists . They 'll send rockets into space . Maybe they can strap you to one of them . They 'll show you parlor tricks . Giving me a second chance could save all of humanity . I 've seen all of your home movies , the bodies left in your wake , the girl you caged up . There 'll be no second chances for you . You must be dying to understand all the items you recovered . They 're fascinating , no ? I don 't suppose you 'll tell me where they came from . There 's a story . A myth from the East of a star that fell from the heavens of blue angels who came bearing a gift for all mankind , - meant to save the world . - You don 't strike me as a believer . Oh , I 've based my whole life on it . History just has the details wrong . Then set history straight . These visitors ... they didn 't come to save the world . They came to conquer it . Conquer ? You heard " conquer " ? I think you got a bad translation . The way I understand it , it was " end " ... to end mankind ... sparing a chosen few , needless to say . Hmm . And that 's why it 's called the Diviner . Yeah . It decides who lives , who dies ... who will inherit the Earth . And only someone who can carry the Diviner is allowed to enter the city . Or more importantly , the temple inside . But I can get you in . And if I let you take a team , where will you take them ? How do you intend to find this city ? Well , I 'll have to look everywhere really , really hard . I 'm not giving you men and money on the off chance that you 'll find this place . Or if you do , that you 'll not take its true power for yourself . Me ? Nah ! No , I 'm not management material . I 'll leave that power part to you . Then why ? What do you have to gain ? I have nothing to lose . I 've lost everything important to me . And I want to kill those who took it ... and finally be reunited with my family . Reunited ? In the afterlife . Okay . Are we going to talk or just go camping ? Look , I don 't know what HYDRA hopes to achieve , but I 'm sure you and I can come up with a better plan - than kidnapping a senator . - HYDRA doesn 't care about you . And they care about you ? Have they protected you ? Because I was the one who got you out of S.H.I.E.L.D. To have me executed . A public trial , your face all over it . Is that what you think ? If I didn 't broker that deal and did the speech Mr. Coulson wanted me to on TV , would we be out here now ? You 're free because of me . - I fought my way out . - Through how many ? The four men I had on detail ? Keep going . I 'm enjoying this . - Enjoying what ? - Watching you work . I 'm ... I 'm trying to have an honest conversation . Okay , one second , I think I 'm gonna be meeting Anna , and the next thing I know , you 're just dragging me through the dirt . Changing tactics , using my name , mentioning your wife ... I used to fall for all your tricks . That is not how I think , Grant ! That 's how you think ! And now you 're turning it back on me . You take after mother . Listen to yourself ! Just listen to yourself ! You twist every act and blame it on somebody else ! Mom and dad were terrible , but they didn 't put the match in your hand when you burnt down that damn house ! And I didn 't squeeze the trigger when you killed all those people ! No . It is my fault . I let you all hollow me out , control me . Spare the non-apology . I 'm a senator . I take responsibility for my actions , Christian . What are you ... ? The well . You still blame me for the well . We both know that it was you who nearly killed Thomas down there . Do you sleep better telling yourself that ? You know , I don 't know what crazy lies that you have built up all these years , but the well doesn 't even exist anymore . It 's gone . Mom and dad buried it . Oh , no . They just covered it up . Hey . Whatever you 're doing , just take a break . - What are you doing ? - Coulson has me patching a transceiver into a system that 's not even meant to handle one . You can do that in your sleep . In my sleep , yes , I 'm quite good at it . Problem is , I 'm awake . I think Coulson 's testing me . Coulson doesn 't roll that way . If he has you in the dark , it 's for a reason . Mm . Or just keeping me busy . I just gave a button to a 300-pound hawaiian dude . Look , we 've been through some crazy , we two especially , but the whole time , Coulson 's been our anchor . He may seem lost sometimes , but he 's always got a plan . O captain , my captain . One blue necktie . - Any complications out there ? - Kept waiting for that other shoe . Great . Everything 's in motion , then ... except the bus . - Get us airborne . - Where to , sir ? Australian outback . We got a satellite network to steal and very little time . - Copy that . - What 's the story with the tie ? It was a gift from Audrey , and I spilled poi all over it . Under six minutes . You can do it . Sorting paperwork ... the life none of us chose . Anything from the interrogation ? Pretty good idea why the Reinhardt files were locked up . Yeah , there 's some nasty stuff in here . Thank god none of this stuff made it on the S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to be stolen away by HYDRA . Hang on . Hang on . I 've got it . I 've got the Reinhardt file . Complete SSR bio , psych eval , and a lovely picture of the nazi bastard . - Wait . No . - Yeah , name 's right beneath it . No . That 's Daniel Whitehall . What , you mean it looks like him ? No , I mean it 's the same man . I 've stared Whitehall in the face . - You 're joking . - Can 't be . He 'd be old as hell now . I would 've agreed with you before " alien " became a word we used daily . May , I know I 'm right . Bobbi was dead-on . He did have a personal connection to Red Skull . What is this guy , Asgardian ? - It 's like he stopped the clock . - Or turned it back . Where 's that photo from ? An old S.H.I.E.L.D. prison called the Rat . - How long was he kept there ? - For life . _ So , curiosity brings her back . Have you come to make a deal ? With the devil ? I considered it . As you 've said , the skies might open up one day . Your work will be valuable . But if that day comes , I know who I 'd want by my side . It isn 't you . We could learn so much together . Instead , we 'll forget ... forget you , forget your work . When I leave , no one else will come , no one to hear your stories , study your deadly artifacts . You 'll be buried . I seriously doubt that . Nothing stays buried forever . For as long as I have a say , you will . Farewell , Dr. Reinhardt . Werner Reinhardt . - Your lucky day . - So , who is this guy again ? Some german researcher . Undersecretary Pierce took pity on him . Said it wasn 't his choice which side of the war he was on . Pierce is just trying to make himself look good . It 's budget cuts , my man . I 'll pull the truck around . Hail HYDRA . Hail HYDRA . After all these years , why now ? - The woman ... we found her . - She 's still alive ? - Is it truly her ? - Sir , you have to see for yourself . - So much lost time . - It 's been under S.H.I.E.L.D. protection since the war , like the rest of us . Who are these people ? We grabbed all the elders from the village and couldn 't believe what we found . Erstaunlich . I grew old living no life . She lives a full one and doesn 't age a day . - Sir , how is this possible ? - I don 't know . But we 'll learn . Discovery requires experimentation . I think it 's time we found out exactly what makes you so special . Undersecretary Pierce grants medical parole in 1989 . After that , there are no records of Reinhardt . Drops his name , loses the accent . A year later , Daniel Whitehall surfaces . Whatever he did to survive happened in that year . Was it alien tech ? Where did he go ? The fountain of youth , apparently . May , I think we should cross-reference the name Daniel Whitehall with any criminal activity from that time . There 's your hook , Bobbi . Now reel him in . Tell me ... your devotion to Whitehall ... based on fear or respect ? My devotion goes far deeper than respect . - Fear goes way deeper , for sure . - That 's not what I meant . You meant programming . I hear compliance will be rewarded . No ? So what is it you 're so afraid of , huh ? What horrible acts do you fear Whitehall will perform on you ? I wonder ... if your friends know the acts that you are capable of , how you were able to ingratiate yourself to HYDRA . Do you fear their judgment should those details ever surface ? Fear of judgment . Perfectly said . You don 't fear Whitehall . You fear disappointing him . And let me tell you , he is going to be very disappointed to see that you gave him up . - I didn 't give up anything . - No . You gave us everything ... Whitehall 's name , his nazi adventures with Red Skull , his age . Did you know he 's hypertensive ? We do . I know he gave you a second chance . Now , do you think he 's gonna give you a third when you tell us how to kill him ? You failed your boss , Mr. Bakshi . I know who Whitehall is . Question remains ... what kind of a man are you ? A loyal one . Cyanide ! We checked him ! Capsule embedded in his cheekbone ! You 're not getting off that easy . I don 't understand . What do you want out of all this ? I want the truth ... about this one event from my past . Admit you made me push Thomas down the well . No . You forced him . He was terrified , and you wouldn 't pull him up . You enjoyed it . Keep trying to put thoughts in my head ... like you always have . You used to convince me they were my own . Not anymore . You lie to yourself . You want to know why ? It 's simple . You can 't reconcile all the ugly , horrible things you do with the hero you so desperately want to become . You 're out of dirt . Sorry to see it go down this way . No , no . No ! No . No , no . No ! - Oh , no ! - Admit it ! Not to me ... to yourself . No . It 's dark down there , Christian . You 'll have plenty of alone time to think . You think . Please , I 'm your brother . Please . - Goodbye , Christian . - No . All right ! I did it ! I did ! I know ! I wanted him dead ! I 'm sorry ! I wanted him dead ! Thomas was the only one mother didn 't torture . And dad always let her do it . She loved him so much . It had to end . I wanted her to feel our pain . But I didn 't have the courage to do it myself . I 'm sorry . Grant , I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . That 's all I wanted to hear . Come on . It 's time we went home . The satellite network we need to map the Earth and find the city is controlled by the U.S. Air Force facility at Kaena point , Oahu , And it 's too heavily guarded to infiltrate . Which is why we came to Australia instead . There 's a small station here that comes online whenever Kaena point 's feed goes down . - But Kaena still needs to go down . - You already took care of that . The watch and the button are two pieces of a trojan horse . - They 'll take down the base 's feed . - Man with the plan . Once per quarter , General Cole inspects Kaena point . This time , he 'll meet the new relay commander . Let me guess ... commander 's name is Darren . That 's right . And since he 's new , introductions will be made . On their own , these two pieces are harmless , undetectable to security . But as they near each other , they 'll power up an E.M.P. , and boom ... kiss your wi-fi , your coffee maker , and your top-secret satellite feed goodbye . - And the australian site goes online . - We 'll have roughly six minutes to patch a back end into the network . Trip , you 'll provide backup . Fitz , you 'll install the transceiver to let Skye hack the network So that we can find out if this city exists once and for all . All because a general got too fat for his jacket . Fitz , how you coming with the transceiver patch ? I 've got it down to 7 minutes , 20 seconds . That 's not good enough . No , that 's with my bad hand . With both , I can do it , definitely . We may actually have a shot at finding the city . You sure it 's something you want to dig up ? If we don 't , HYDRA will . We need to get there first . This doesn 't feel right . Skye , you reading us ? Standing by with geek squad . Paddington and Timelord are closing in . - E.M.P. ready in 40 seconds . - Copy that . Kaena point is down . Six minutes on the clock . Guys ? - Skye , there 's something jamming us ... - Down ! Down ! Ambush ! Fitz ! I am tied to crew ! - HYDRA ! - How the hell 'd they get here ? ! Oh , it 's coming alive ! The server 's online ! Time to move ! Find the access point ! We can 't miss this window ! Follow me ! Now ! Get comms back online . You guys are my satellite wranglers . I need vector scripts ready to execute the second Fitz get us on that network . Lock yourselves inside . Go . - Stay down . - I need a few minutes . Fitz , down ! Trip ! Ah , damn it , Trip . Trip , talk to me . Nah , stop . He 's gonna bleed out . We need to stop it . I can help . I 'm a doctor . - Put pressure there , please . - Can you control it ? First went through clean . Second bullet is deep . There 's a lot of blood . Got to get it out . Hand me the scalpel . Clamp . - Forceps . - I prefer we stabilize and move . The bullet 's holding the wound open . If we keep our heads about us , he has a chance , Phil . Shouldn 't have said " Phil . " Not supposed to know that . You probably wouldn 't recognize me from the picture I left for her , though . I haven 't changed as much as she has since then . If I let go of this clamp , he dies . I just sliced this man 's brachial artery . Mr. Coulson , hand me the gun . - You too , son . - Fitz . You 'd use this man 's life as a bargaining chip ? An opportunity , actually ... to get out of this sticky situation . And we get to know each other a bit . - Skye wouldn 't want Trip to die . - She 's not here , is she ? That 's a relief . I 'm only gonna get one chance at a first impression . - This doesn 't look very good . - You 've already made an impression ... pile of bodies , going to work for Whitehall . - I don 't think it 's good for Skye to ... - You 're not her father ! You 're S.H.I.E.L.D. , who took her from me . I need Whitehall . - The end will justify the means . - The end . And that 's gonna happen in the city we 're both here to find ? Yes . I anticipated you 'd be close , but you 're already trying ' map the Earth . I guess we had the same idea . Whitehall didn 't even know about the city until I turned him on to it . He thinks the Diviner is just a weapon . He has no idea of its true power , of what 's inside . - Oh . There 's something inside . - What are we talking about ? - Tesseract-level power ? - Sure . I don 't know what that is . You realize we 're talking life and death here . I know . It 's exciting , isn 't it ? I mean , both sides racing to the temple , life and death , flesh and blood , emotions ! Who knows how it 'll shake out ? All I know is , my baby 's gonna be right there in the center of it . - I know you want to meet her . - Oh , I can 't wait . I mean , I have to wait for the right circumstances , but ... 'Cause if you let this man die , - Skye will never ... - That 's not her name ! And I won 't let him die . I 'm gonna tell you just how to save him , which will give me time to get away . Two syringe packets inside . Sorry . It 's a bit of a mess in there . When I release this , you 're gonna pump his wounds full of that clotting agent as fast as you can if you want to save his life . And apply pressure , okay ? - Here we go . - We 'll find you . And when we do , you and I will finish this conversation . I look forward to it . Fitz ! - Quickly , Fitz , quick . - Okay , done . Get the other one ready . We haven 't heard from them in over five minutes . Wait . Whoa , whoa , wait . The transceiver is powering up . Yes , Fitz ! Okay . Prioritize all thermal and ground-penetrating imaging . Okay . Hold on , Trip . Hold on . Okay . Come on . Okay . He 's stabilizing . As a person who spent a considerable portion of his life incarcerated , I know how rare second chances are . If you 're given one , take it . The opportunity may be fleeting , so it must be recognized and seized . Sometimes , the solution takes days or weeks or years . But no matter the sacrifice , one must be willing to enjoy the trauma of shaking off all that you were ... to become something new something better . What did you take from her , sir ? Everything that I possibly could . Dispose of the rest . Everyone deserves a second chance , but few are willing to do what it takes to earn one . I completely understand . I think my skills could be of use to you . I know sacrifice , what it takes to move forward in life . I have no doubt that 's true . The bodies of Massachusetts senator Christian Ward and both his mother and father were identified by police tonight in what appears to be a murder-suicide . A partially destroyed tape found in the fire is believed to be the senator 's confession . I wanted him dead ! I did ! The only one mother didn 't torture . It had to end . I wanted her to feel our pain . - You okay ? - Yeah . What 's up ? Nothing . Hell of a day . Please don 't " hell of a day " me . What 's wrong ? You pushed him a little hard , didn 't you ? What did you think was gonna happen ? I miscalculated . I thought he was gonna talk . You sure you weren 't afraid he was gonna talk ? He 's laying out all your dirty laundry , - and suddenly , you lay him out . - You think I would do that ? I can 't argue a man to suicide . Clearly , you 've never been in an argument with yourself , then . You had him right where you wanted him ! What is it you want to know , huh ? I 'll tell you ... Doesn 't matter what I ask . I can 't trust the answer . Write that sentence down , hand it to your therapist . I have always been honest with you , and you can 't accept it . You search for lies ! You 're an elite spy ! I 'd be crazy not to . You know you 've lied to me . This happens every time ... we get closer , you get nervous . We 're not close . You just spent the day convincing a man he was brainwashed . - I don 't know where the angles end . - With you ! Why do you think I vouched for you with Coulson , huh ? As much as I 'd like to believe it was my magical personality , I think you have something up and running and need allies . And know that I 'll have your back , whatever it is . Will you never trust me ? But I 'll never stop wanting to . Mm . It 's been running for a few hours . 26 satellites scouring the world for your map . Good . Multispectral images , ground-penetrating radar . Now we wait for the ding that says we have a match . If there 's evidence of this city on Earth , the computer will find it . Guys ? Is everything okay ? They 're patching Trip up and he 's going to be fine , but you 're acting like you saw the devil out there . What ? We 'll return in a moment . Doctor , how nice to see you . Please , come ... sit . You 've had a long night . You should tell me when we 're having a meeting . I would 've freshened up . Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D. , and you an expert on the Obelisk . Together , I think there 's much we can achieve . I was a member of Coulson 's team . Lived with them for months . - So you know the entire team . - Like family . Heard you crossed Coulson . That can be rough . Oh , it wasn 't a complete loss . It 's always good to look your enemy right in the eye . Oh , god . Oh , god . Oh , my love . I 'll find him . I 'll do to him ... what he did to you . I will tear him apart ! subtitle by ~ pinkmei ~

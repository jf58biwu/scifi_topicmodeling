 Not only is this a bad idea , Rex , it 's just stupid . No , no . Not just stupid ... outstandingly stupid . Trust me , Noah ... It 's primal . Scare Claire , and she 'll grab the nearest guy for protection , and that would be you . And that would be Claire and Annie . This had better work . I know what I 'm doing . Are you sure you want to see this movie ? I hear it 's really scary . So is a jar of killer bees when it 's knocked off a shelf in Biology class . Uh ... yeah . He is absolutely positive . Ew ! That actually happened to someone I know . Wait for it . Still waiting . Hey , Caesar ! Hello , little brother . Whoa . So is that some sort of nanite thing ? Mango smoothie . But this is my hyper-electromagnet that can disassemble a tank from a kilometer away . Mmm . And evidently can also make deliciously creamy smoothies . Nice . But what I really need to do is scare a girl into my best friend 's arms . Oh ? Noah and I took a couple of ladies to a horror movie . Ah ! To engage their paleomammalian brain so the fear response would be to cling to nearest male . Did it work ? Yeah , but they both clung to me . I believe the word is " score . " Yeah ... except Noah pretty much hates me now . He was supposed to be the hero . So I need to step it up , and it needs to be foolproof . I 'm thinking ... A haunted house . Yes ! - Huh ? - A twin challenge . Create a paranormal paradigm with technology in order to evoke a paionate response ! That is interesting ! The biochemistry of romance is simple . The neurotransmitter chemical , phenylethylamine , is excreted by the hypothalamus . I was thinking less excreting , more fog machine and lights . Oh , this will be way better . Trust me . Cool . # So make way to start the revolution # # make way # # we 're gonna have fun tonight # # make way to start the revolution # # so make way # # so make way to start the revolution # # make way to start the revolution # # so make way # A ghost hunt ? ! Epic fail , dude . This is better than a movie ! Claire will be clinging to you before she 's even inside . Clinging ? Doubtful . The girls will probably freak at the sheer lameness of this stuff ! Are those EMF detectors ? Hey , guys . And a thermal camera ? Awesome ! I knew if we were meeting at the Wrightson Hotel , it had to be about the haunting . It was Noah 's idea . Really ? Extra points to you . Uh , yeah . I 'm ... fascinated with the ... mysteries of the paranormal . But you don 't believe any of that , right ? U ... um ... No ? At best , these detectors will pick up the electromagnetic distortions caused by the building 's wiring . Supposedly , even weak EMF can create feelings of unease and paranoia in the brain , although it 's never been duplicated outside a laboratory setting . Does this work ? Uh ... Ghosts make the needle wiggle ? Right . Okay , let 's go . Gee , look at me ... 100 % cling-free . It 's going to work out . Trust me . I know what I 'm doing . I heard that before ! All clear . Ugh ! So , I don 't see any bandages . Things must be good with you . Yep . No more bad luck . I haven 't broken a bone this year . At least , not one of my own . Wow . Didn 't expect furniture . That 's because no moving crew would stay . I read ... That they just ran , completely terrified ? Uh ... Something like that . And they would never speak of what they saw ... ever . Supposedly , the ghost of Wrightson still roams the hotel , his invisible hands opening and closing doors , checking on guests . Paranormal activity increased after the nanite event . Of course , everything was freaky after that , so even a hint of weirdness scared people away . And that 's why they closed down the hotel and left it ... To the spirits . Oh , yeah . This is gonna work . Whoa . There 's a guy in need of a party . That 's Wrightson himself . You sure know a lot about this guy . His name is under the painting . That black cat is an icon of superstition and the occult , which triggers subconscious connections . It 's basic psychology . And this is real science . - A marble ? - Just a simple test . The floor isn 't level . And a tilted hotel explains those doors opening and closing by themselves . Human nature can 't be deconstructed into theorems and formulas , miss test tube . Science requires provable evidence . Everything else is guesswork . Well , guess what I 'm thinking right now . If we leave now , we can still have a decent date at the snack shack . I spent all afternoon setting this place up to make you look like a hero . Just give it a chance . Setting up ? Great . Passing potential embarrassment and proceeding directly to utter humiliation . Time to turn on the tunes . Thanks , Rex . Kind of handy having a hero around . Nice work back there . How was the clinging ? Well , what was I supposed to do ? Just get Claire to use the thermal camera near the fountain , and you 'll be ... Whoa ! Check out the claw marks . Looks like the work of a chisel-point pickax . L ... long story . But he 's fine now . Good to know . Okay , I say we split into teams to cover more ground . As long as you 're not afraid . Yeah . Those two are absolutely terrified . Claw marks ? Really ? But ... I didn 't make these . I 'm getting strong EMF readings in this direction . Whoa ! It 's going nuts ! Probably picking up the pipes from the fountain . Do you feel cold ? Aren 't ghosts supposed to be cold ? Very funny . The walls of this atrium must funnel breezes to this spot . Can a breeze do that ? It 's frozen solid . Try the thermal camera . Right . The cold spots are coming from the fountain . What ? ! Weird . Must have been a video glitch . Well ? How did the cold spot work ? Wonderful . She monitored wind direction while I froze . Okay , then go take EMF readings by the sofa . Trust me . I ... Whatever . Just go . Gosh , the meter is going wild . Something 's gonna happen . Nothing is going to happen , because there 's no such thing as ghosts . Perfect . Whoa ! That was crazy . - How could that happen ? - It doesn 't make sense . Do you think it heard what I said ? It heard what I said ! Not possible . Not possible ! But ... I didn 't ... This place is haunted ! Whatever it was is gone . Excuse us for a second . That ... was ... awesome ! What else is in your bag of tricks ? Noah , listen to me . The howling and shredding ... Not me . Must have been a power surge . Maybe your brother 's magnet is more powerful than you thought . Uh , maybe . It was made to disassemble a tank . And pulp mangoes . There has to be a scientific explanation for what happened , so I say we find it . What was that ? You three , stay here . I 'll check it out . Uh , I better go . You stay . No . I 'll go . No ! I will ! We 're all going . Nobody splits up . Not that it 's a ghost or anything . Right . Because that 's ... ridiculous . Maybe that crash was a stray cat . Let 's hope so . Here , kitty . Here , kitty . It could be a dog . Here , doggy . Here , doggy . Or a raccoon . Raccoons do that , right ? Okay . That was more than a cold spot . We need to get out of here ! No . This is too important . We have to document it ... Like scientists . Something weird is happening here ... something dangerous . Facing the unknown is always dangerous , my friend . Noah ! This is real ! - It isn 't one of my tricks ! - It isn 't ? And by " tricks , " you mean what , exactly ? So , you thought you 'd have some fun scaring the girls . No . That wasn 't what ... And you were the mastermind , using this electromagnet to move things around . I moved the couch . I didn 't shred it . Probably a power surge . That 's what I said ! I thought you were different . I 'm different ! Way different ! I would never be , uh , the same , ' cause ... I 'm different . Claire ! Look at this ! This is more your kind of stuff , but I 'm impressed . A mini-chiller . I read about these in science journals . Never thought I 'd hold one . That 's my brother 's design . We weren 't talking to you . Well , I 'm talking now . There 's something in this hotel that I didn 't fake . We need to leave before someone is hurt . Because Annie and I are so helpless , right ? I seem to remember kicking some evo tail at the prom . Yeah ! Of course , we had a fully armed battle tank then . Rex , the plan 's a bust . Give it up . But it 's not like getting out of here is a bad idea . Run ! Now ! I 'll make our own door if I have to ! Aah ! Huh ? Aah ! Rex , are you okay ? That wasn 't a trick . That was a real ghost . It 's not a ghost . It 's an evo . Come on ! Come on ! Where 's the water ? ! Sorry . Sorry . Weak pipes , I guess . It 's okay . So , how long was I ... So , what is it ? An invisible evo ? I know it sounds weird , but I could sense some sort of group of floating nanites , like a nanite cloud or something . Can you stop it ? Not if I can 't touch it . Maybe you should call Providence for backup . I 'm not getting my brother in trouble . We didn 't exactly go through the proper channels to ... borrow this stuff . Besides , dealing with evos is my job . This is doable . So the nanites are like a termite colony ... Lots of individuals that make a sort of hive mind that can think without being solid . Felt solid enough when it was slamming me around . - That 's good . - What ? ! That 's when the nanites are closest together . If we magnetize them , they might cluster enough for you to make contact . Can you guys rip a magnetic field that will do that ? Didn 't exactly cover that in sophomore physics . Try sticking your brother 's magnet into the cloud . Simple enough . Yeah . But wait until it 's slamming you around . At least we don 't have to worry about Wrightson 's ghost anymore . Unless he 's the evo . Great ... ghost evos . Because I was getting bored with the normal stuff . Get down ! Uhhhhhhh ! Really wasn 't that bored ! Whoa ! Noah ! I did it . Maybe you should call Providence for backup now . Are you kidding ? Now I can touch it . Do I have your attention now ? Good . Just hold still , and I 'll get those nanites out of you . I thought you couldn 't cure nonhumans . Getting better . Let 's hope I get lucky . Huh ? ! Good trick . Here 's one of mine . Now , come here , and we 'll see if I can cure you ! The magnet isn 't strong enough . Is there a way to fix that ? It probably has a neodymium alloy core , which increase in strength the colder it gets ! We need the mini-chiller . That was covered in sophomore science ? Extra-credit project . I got it ! Whoops . Whoa ! Whoa ! Unh ! Ugh ! Hey , Rex ! When you have a sec , we 're stuck ! Claire ? Are you okay ? I 'm good . No problems . Claire , by any chance , are you , um , claustrophobic ? A little bit . Get the freezer thingy ! I 'll keep it busy ! That 's right ... Deep breaths . Don 't look at the walls . Look at me . I 'm so sorry for getting you into this . No matter what happens , I will get you out of here , safe and sound . Right . As soon as you find your crowbar . I swear I had it with me this morning . It 's gonna be okay . Come on , kitty , kitty , kitty ! Put a move on ! This is not working . I need a plan " b . " You okay ? Just another Monday for me . Aah ! Rex ! Duck ! H ... how ... How would ducking have helped ? Let 's give this one more shot . Oh , you 're such a pretty kitty . He 's so soft . Annie , maybe you 're not the one to be handling a black cat . Bro , haven 't you ever heard of knocking ? Thank you . A lot . You were ... Kind of my hero in there . Ah , just basic psychology . Not that ... It 's a real science . Seems to have a battery problem . But you can certainly see the potential for your spook show . The ... Uh ... Show you are planning for ... for next Halloween . Can 't get started early enough . Ladies and gentlemen , my brother , Caesar , the inventor of tonight 's illusions . O ... okay , most of them . So , Claire , I thought we might ... Your electromagnet used a neodymium alloy core , right ? Impressive deduction . Claire used the mini-chiller to boost its power to condense the cloud evo . A cloud evo ? - Still waiting . - I 'm sorry . Tonight didn 't work out quite the way I ... Did that thing just cross our path ? Quick ! Maybe we can circle around !

The carnival is closed , Samuel . Everybody saw what you did to that town . They 're afraid of me . Can you blame them ? We finally have a home here ... a place to make a life . It 's what we wanted . It 's what you told us that you wanted . You don 't trust me anymore , do you ? You haven 't for a long time . So show me why I should . Out of trust is faith , Lydia . It must be very hard for you to come by when you can steal a look into someone 's very soul with just a touch . After all I 've done for you , for all of them , I 'm the villain . And you ... you seem to have become the empath to replace Joseph . Everyone 's looking to you now for their voice , aren 't they ? What have you been telling them ? Nobody respects you anymore , And I 'm gonna win it back . I love them , I need them . And I 'll do whatever I have to do ... to prove my worth . ¶ ¶ Don 't worry , I 'm here to save you . Hey , it 's Peter Petrelli . Is Emma Coolidge there ? Look , it 's ... it 's important . Just , uh ... Yeah , I already went by her place . she 's not there . Look , if you see her , call me okay ? Yeah , thanks . Ma ? Janice , honey , you home ? Janice ? Wow . Haven 't you ever heard of making two trips ? Oh , god , are you back inside my head ? That 's so two months ago . Here , let me give you a hand . Calm down , Parkman . If I wanted you dead , we wouldn 't be talking . Then what the hell do you want ? It 's complicated . My life 's taken a turn since our time together . I suppose you could say I 'm on a fact-finding mission . Matt , honey . Janice , hey . I thought you 'd be at work by now . Well , I took Matty to day care , and my client cancelled , so ... lucky I was home , because your friend Gabriel was in the neighborhood . He is full of stories . Stories ? From when we were partners on the force . So I figured that you guys would like to catch up , so I put a little late lunch together . Oh , it looks so good , thank you . Parkman , take a load off , have a nosh we really need to catch up . You know , this is probably not a good time . In fact , it 's not even a big deal . It 's over , I don 't need to tell him . You kind of do . A super powered serial killer shape-shifted into a coed and then made a pie chart of your life . It wasn 't a pie chart . - It was more like a ... - Whatever . you have to tell your dad . Really ? 'cause when Sylar killed my real dad , he didn 't tell me . I know . You 're right . But you ... I know . I know . How long are you gonna hold a grudge ? the whole silent treatment is getting old , we were in a good place before all this . Do you want me to come with ? Yes . No . This is something I have to do alone . I could wait . It 's probably gonna be a while . The list of things we have to talk about ... Sylar ... The cover-up of my dad 's death , let 's not forget about the carnival . I 'm sure there 's plenty my dad 's been wanting to say about that . Yeah . Well , good luck . You 're gonna feel better when it 's all over with or if not , at least you 'll be caffeine-ated . - Claire . - Lauren , hey . You gonna let me in ? Yeah , of course . Where 's my dad ? He just stepped out for a moment . I brought some coffee . Thought it was time to talk things over with him . I 'm sorry , but ... but why are you here exactly ? Oh , um ... Your father and I are ... No , no , that 's not ... that 's not what I was talking about . I mean , you have primatech files and satellite maps , and this is everything that my dad said that he would put behind him . Claire , I 'm just trying to help a friend . Friends do dinners and movies , okay ? You want to help ? You tell my dad whatever it is that he 's doing here , he needs to stop . I wish it was that simple . Why ? What 's going on ? There was an incident . It was Samuel Sullivan . What did he do ? They 're saying it was a landslide , but we know it was Samuel . Wait , you think he buried that town ? Can he even do that ? He gains more power the more specials he has around . 200 are dead , and they 're still digging out the bodies . What are you planning to do ? You know , your dad 's gonna be back any minute , why don 't you just take this ... Actually , I have class , but it looks like you guys have this under control , so just tell him I stopped by . - Claire , wait . - Enjoy the coffee . Claire . I 've always loved the black and whites , are they still Matty 's favorite ? How do you know that ? Well , like I said , Parkman and I used to be pretty tight back in the day , we went through addiction counselling together , and faced our mutual demons . You know what , honey ? I 'm gonna show Gabe here what I 've been doing in the basement . Ah , yes . The wonderful world of Matt 's projects . You 're gonna love it down there . I 'm sure I will . You 're on a fact-finding mission ? what the hell does that mean ? I had to make sure I remembered it right . Husband and father ... You 've really figured out a way to live with your ability . You know , you may not believe this , but in some ways , you 're actually stronger than I am . Look , I 'm not afraid of you , okay ? So if this is about revenge ... Well , after what you did to me , I was tempted , but I don 't want to be that person anymore . Uh-huh . I need you to go inside my head again . You 're serious . Oh , wow , you are insane . If I am , it 's because that 's what my powers have made me . I can 't live with them anymore , Parkman . So you need to take them away . You want me to ... how am I supposed to do that ? Create a mental block , repress them . I don 't really care , to be honest . All I know is that once I 'm free from the temptation of my ability ... Mm-hmm ? You 're gonna be normal ? I 'm sorry , that ship sailed , what , 50 murders ago . I 'm asking nicely . The last time that I was inside your head , you turned my life into a living hell , what makes you think I 'm gonna risk that ? Janice ... and the kid . I really do want to change , but I 'm insane ... remember ? And all you have to do is point . Fine , I will try but you have to let Janice go . Consider it a gesture of good faith . Hey , mom . What 's wrong ? Oh , it 's Nathan . The stone-cutters called . They needed a final wording for his headstone , and I didn 't know what to say . I guess it 's the finality of it . I mean , they 're just words , but when you write them down , when you etch them in stone ... I know , mom . Maybe it was selfish of me , Peter , but I just needed to see you . I needed to be sure you were okay . Because of your vision . I had the dream too , mom . I saw all the people , and Sylar ... I think he was trying to help Emma . You saw that too ? Whatever this mission is , Peter , remember this : One isolated act does not make Sylar your friend 's saviour . I need you to help me find him , mom . I know you know where he is . Sylar 's never been far from my thoughts , but I 'm begging you , don 't go . He murdered Nathan , and the last time you faced him , he almost killed you . Mom , Emma 's in trouble . People 's lives are at stake . Nathan would never turn his back on them , and you know that I can 't either . This is gonna end badly . Samuel is crazy . My dad 's gonna take him down , and there is no way this is gonna end well . What , what do you want me to say ? Well , what do you think I should do ? Um , I don 't know , you 've got a humanities lecture in 20 minutes . Here 's a crazy idea ... maybe you should go to class for once . Did you hear anything I just said ? I did . Yeah , all of it . But I mean , what are you really gonna do , Claire ? Your dad was right about the carnival . you never should have gone there . Look , Samuel is a bad guy , yes but the rest of the carnival is all family and children , and they just want to live their lives being open about their abilities . I thought you said that they were giving Samuel his power . But they don 't know that . You were only there for one day , how could you possibly know for sure ? I need to borrow your car . No . I thought you would back me up on this . You say you want a normal life , right ? Just let your dad handle it , come on , please . Just come to class with me . Or not . Bring it back full . She 's not answering . She said she had a class . Claire , call me as soon as you get this . You shouldn 't have let her go without talking to me first . What was I supposed to do , drag her by her hair and lock her in your closet ? What do you want to do ? We go . If Samuel 's escalating his attacks , we can 't afford to sit around and wait to see what he 's gonna do next . You 're right , but you 're also emotional . Look , this Samuel is a threat and not just to Claire . You go in with less than 100 % focus ... I can handle this . You don 't have to worry about me . That 's not an option anymore . Let 's go . Claire . We need to talk . What are you doing here ? Your father is coming for Samuel , to kill him . Claire , if Samuel finds out , he 's ... I know , that 's why I came ahead . I have seen things like this go wrong before , and I don 't want my dad or anyone else getting hurt , but we don 't have a lot of time . Samuel will never go for it . He 'll never turn himself in . We have to try . Claire , he is not listening to me , to anyone . If your father is really on his way , I should get Amanda . And what , Lydia ... run away ? has it come to that ? I can 't say I blame you ... What I did to that town , all those people . Claire , I ... I 'd hoped you 'd have a better reason to come back to us . How could you do that ? I don 't know what I was thinking . I wish I could take it all back ... and so many other things ... Joseph . Did I ever tell you the first carnival act that Joseph and I ever saw was the trapeze ? The way they flung themselves through the air , we both thought they had powers , just like us . But when we went backstage , the man told us the only power he had was gravity . No matter how high he went , It was always there to catch him . I 've come to realize that gravity is different things to people . For much of my life , Joseph was mine . I 've been losing my way , and now even my own family is afraid of me , and the only strength I have left ... You have to take responsibility . You have to turn yourself over . To your father ? he 's not exactly known for his mercy . If you give yourself up , he will not hurt you , I promise . Please , Samuel , listen to her . If you care about this family , then protect them . There 's Samuel ... on the midway . Got him . Wait a second . Is that Claire ? at 2 : 00 . Hello , Claire . Dad , where are you ? Close . I heard you stopped by earlier , thanks for the coffee . What 's the situation there ? Samuel wants to surrender . Really ? - Why ? - To protect his family . He 's willing to turn himself over as long as the rest of the carnival stays safe and under the grid . And you trust him ? If there 's a chance that we can do this without anyone getting hurt , don 't we have to try ? Dad , it 's the best plan , all right ? you get Samuel , and nobody gets hurt . All right , tell him to meet us in the field outside of the carnival . I 'll see you soon . He 's surrendering . And you think he 's just gonna give himself up ? I don 't know , but Claire seems to think so , and I have to trust her . It 's done , he wants you to meet him in the field . Are you sure this is a good idea ? Oh , I wouldn 't worry . If it 's a set-up , you 're just gonna get a better shot at him , out in the open , away from everybody . Wait a second . I 'll go down and walk him out . Keep him in the cross-hairs . Hey ... be careful . I know my recent actions have caused some of you to question where it is my heart lies . I regret what I 've done . I acted impulsively , and that has brought one of them ... an agent ... to our door . - What . - It 's okay . It 's okay , they just want me . Claire has helped arrange a peaceful surrender . I 'll go with them . No , no , please , listen . I know everyone will not agree with this decision , but it 's the only way . The safety of each and every one of you and keeping this family together is what matters most to me and if that means I have to leave , so be it . All right , Parkman , I did my part . I let Janice walk , now it 's your turn . I know . I know , I said I would try . Aah ! Nothing 's changed . I know you can do this Parkman , what 's wrong ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Okay . Okay . I ... - I can 't . - Try again . You know , maybe ... maybe it 's not me . Sylar , come on , maybe it 's you , maybe you 're just fighting it . Maybe you really don 't want to let go of these powers . - No ! You 're lying ! - I 'm not lying ! Matt , what 's going on ? No , stop ! Stop ! No ! Oh , god , please let her go . Hey ! Hey , look at me . Look at me ! Come on , let her go she had nothing to do with this . Come on , let her go . Let her go . I 'll try again , come on . That 's not good enough . - You see what you made me do ? - Hey ! I don 't even know if I can do this for you ... come on . Maybe you need a little more motivation . You will purge me of these powers , Parkman ... or I will use them ... I will use them all and trust me , I can get really creative . Damn . Samuel ! Come quickly ! No . No , no , no , no . No . No ! You need to put pressure on the wound . I need your help , come on . You wanted to know what was in my heart . You ... did ... this ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . They needed a villain ... someone worse than me . You gave that to them , thank you . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . No , it 's too late , Claire . She 's gone . Come on , dad . Pick up , please . Samuel . Dad . I found him on the hill ... With this ! Are you okay ? Claire , I didn 't do it . I didn 't shoot anything .. You murderer ! He 's the one . You brought him here , you 're one of them . Hey , back off ! No , don 't hurt them . We 're better than this . Take him to the house of mirrors , tie him up . And her ? My trailer . Get off ! Get off ! No ! Dad ! Dad ! let go ! Samuel , he didn 't do it ! Get off ! Get off ! If you hurt her , I swear to god ... That 's the problem , isn 't it ? one cruel thought is all it takes , these powers make it so easy . I understand that , believe me but you don 't have to use them like this . Except I do , the powers are me now . you 've been there , dealt with the abilities the constant temptation . Tell me , how do you compartmentalize , how do you keep them from overwhelming the rest of your life ? You start by accepting the fact that you 're more than just your abilities . Come on , we 're people first . Please , let her go . Look , I 'll ... I 'll try to do what you want , but you got to give me a couple of minutes to make sure she 's okay . Last chance , Parkman . Come on . It 's okay , come on . - That 's Sylar , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I 'm so sorry . This is crazy . He wants me to take away his powers and make him normal meanwhile , I looked inside his head long enough to realize that he 's serious , but I can 't give him what he wants . Forget what he wants . I work with monsters like this , he 's broken inside , Matt . We have to bury him so that he cannot hurt anyone else . Yeah , okay . Just go , go , and don 't come back until I call you . All right , get on with it . You were right ... I was holding back . It 's all about motivation , right ? What if I told you that I can be special , but to do it , I 'd have to hurt a lot of people , should I ? You , you could never hurt anyone . Mommy . I don 't ... I don 't feel any different . Try something , go ahead , on me come on . You did it . My powers are gone . No , they 're not gone . They 're just buried ... somewhere that you can never get to them . You 've threatened my family for the last time . What did you do ? I know exactly what scares you , Gabriel and it 's being alone with your immortality . What did you do to me ? I have trapped you inside your twisted mind . You 're gonna be alone , Sylar , very much alone ... In this nightmare that will last forever and the best part about it is that when I leave here , you 're not gonna remember what I did and you 're gonna live every empty day like it 's real . You said you would help me . Yeah , well , I guess there 's still a little of you left inside me ... because I lied . Enjoy hell . Parkman ? Parkman ? Matt ? Matt ! Samuel said you 'd come , thank god you 're here . I need your help . Ah ... Finally , there 's a doctor in the house . What happened ? - We were attacked . - You were attacked ? By who ? People who don 't understand us , Emma ... People who fear us . It doesn 't matter . What matters is that you 're here . You 're not just gonna heal me , Emma . You 're gonna help us make a new world for ourselves . Yeah . We 'll show them , Emma we 'll show them how great we can be . Matt ! Matt ! Hey , man . Sorry , I was , uh ... I was working downstairs . That 's okay , man , been a long time . Yeah , how are you ? What ? - Sylar is here . - What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about what you 're thinking . You 're gonna take him , you can 't just take him ? Look , people die , Matt . Sylar has to save them . Peter , he 's a murderer , Hey ! Hey ! Come on , stop . Listen . He 's trapped , Peter . What the hell did you do ? I went inside his head , and I trapped him inside his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . I have to bring him back . No . No , you can 't do that . You go into his head , you might not come out . Peter . Peter , don 't . Peter ! No ! Peter ! Matt ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ! Tracy Strauss . Noah Bennet told me to call if anything went wrong . I went to Bennet . I thought ... Look what they 've done ... these so-called normal people . How could you let this happen ? What I did was wrong , I know that but I was willing to sacrifice myself to protect you ... to save this family that we 've all come to love . But the outside world has proven once again that people like us will never be accepted . We 've all seen it ... In the eyes of those who come to see our shows ... dazzled by our abilities ... but filled with revulsion of who we are . I saw it again yesterday ... in that small town over the hill ... and today in the bullets that struck me and murdered our dear Lydia . It 's time . It 's time we put fear behind us , it 's time we showed the world ... what we truly are . Edited by Scooby

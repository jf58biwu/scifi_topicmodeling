 '13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives , 'and it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . 'There 's an extra terrestrial super computer in the wall , 'her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , 'a school girl investigator across the road , 'her adopted daughter from another world 'and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . ' Ready ? Always . Hi . I 'm Joseph Serf . I 'm here to introduce the Serf Board from Serf Systems , the world 's newest and best portable computer . The 15th at 5pm . Put it in your diary . The day the Serf Board arrives , and the revolution begins . Billions of dollars of research and development have gone into this compact affordable device . Where 's my billion dollars , Mr Serf ? Excuse me . Did I say device ? I mean a friend . From the 15th , the world will have another question . SQUEAKING How did we manage before the Serf Board ? Hello ? SQUEAKING Hello ? LIFT BELL RINGS Idiot . SQUEALING SHE SCREAMS Do you want to see tomorrow , today ? Morning , Sky ! I think I 've got everything he wants . Oh , it doesn 't matter , Mum , he says , and then when he turns up , it 's straight to the fridge , and why haven 't we got any bacon ? Well let him starve . When I went up to Oxford , the cupboards were bare . Are you all right , Sky ? I 'm just a little nervous . I 'm meeting Luke face-to-face , not just on the screen . Well , you couldn 't have a better brother . Oh . Right , yeah . Not my room any more . Luke , oh , welcome home . Hi , Mum . Hi , Clani ! Don 't call us that ! Clani ? Who 's Clani ? Clyde , Rani , Clani . It 's meant to be funny . He can 't keep away . Luke , meet Sky in person . Sky . Hi . Hi , Sky ! You 're taller than you look on webcam . Yes , yes , I am . Sorry , I just went in your room , I forgot it 's not mine any more . It 's the best room , and you don 't live here any more . It 's fine , it 's really fine . Hey , finally face-to-face . It 's the clash of the nerds . Sky , behold my greatest success . Frankenbane 's monster , now a normal human student , living off Pot Noodles , rising at 12 sharp to watch Loose Women . Yeah , shut up . Sky , I really hope we can be friends . Of course we 'll be friends . I suppose we 're sort of brother and sister . Tea ? Yeah . I had to leave K9 back at Uni . But look . I made this . A dog whistle . Cos you never know . What 's he doing up there ? He 's backing up the Bodleian Library . The whole lot ! He wouldn 't come back with me . ' Oh , good ... ' .. ness me , what a terrible shame . ' Oi , Mr Smith , don 't be nasty . We could always swap you for another computer . Like the Serf Board ! I hardly think that would be a good exchange . Well , it 's the launch this afternoon , at five ! 'Affordable device . ' Excuse me . Did I say device ? And nobody knows what it does when you switch it on . The rumours say everything ! There 's a rehearsal of the launch this morning . Just three of the country 's very top journalists have been invited . Do you know any of them ? Could you , like , blag us in ? Ahem . I said just the top journalists have been invited . Yeah , so what if we swap a ticket ? I mean me ! Me ! What d 'you think pays for all this , taking in washing ? Sorry , I just didn 't think it was your kind of a story . Yeah , almost good enough , Rani . I am not going to miss that ! Who said you 're going to miss it ? Homecoming treat . I 'm not going to miss it , either ! Fine , you can come too , Sky . And ? Oh , I 'm sorry , that 's all I could manage . I shouldn 't really be taking anybody , it 's highly unprofessional . That 's so unfair ! Sorry , Clani . Family outing . Basically , we blab anything about the Serf Board before the actual release and they sue us to death . But what if I disagree with the terms and conditions ? They 're fine , just sign it . Believe me , if he says they 're fine , they 're fine . Whatever you say . Sarah Jane Smith ! Let me drink you in ! As lovely as ever . Luke , Sky , Lionel Carson . An old , old friend . I could have been so much more ! Now I am a ruin . You remain a paragon ! Lionel was my editor when I first started on the nationals . He moved on to food and wine . So why are you covering the Serf Board , Mr Carson ? I pulled rank . To impress my grandchildren . " I 've met the great Mr Serf . " I leave the technical stuff to you young people . I can 't abide computers . Nothing wrong with a typewriter , says I. What 's a typewriter ? Goodness me ! Make me feel even more old-fashioned , why don 't you ? You were old-fashioned when I was new-fangled . My son and my daughter . Sorry to keep you waiting . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm John Harrison , Serf Systems public relations . The rehearsal is about to begin . So if you 'd like to follow me up . Well , that 's us . Would you care to accompany me , oh , radiant one , in memory of what might have been ? Oh , go on , then . BUZZING Luke , can you feel that ? Feel what ? Electricity ... building up . It 's strong . Probably just a storm on the way . No , this feels different , strange . 'And then I shall say ... ' Please say hi to Joseph Serf ! And cue Mr Serf . Wow . Not half bad in the flesh . He 's like you , Sarah Jane , he 's got charisma ! Thank you , Johnny . Then I 'll say , pleased to meet you . And then I 'll do this . Whoa , who 's that beautiful guy ? Yes , very good , sir , very spontaneous . What next ? You stand there , sir , and your close-ups will be on camera three . Is the teleprompt in the right position , sir ? Yeah , looking good to me . And then straight into the spiel ? Straight into the spiel , sir . The Serf Board will revolutionise the way we work , the way we play . Every home should have one . Soon , every home will have one . Perfect , sir . And then the attendees will each be given a Serf Board , like so . The Serf Board . Take it home , press go , play and learn . It 's a phenomenon . And you 're going to love it . You 're going to love it . Why wait is my motto . Download , browse , photos , books ... everything . You 're going to love it . It 's the future , it 's tomorrow ... and you love it . You want one , you need one , everybody wants one , everybody 's got to get one . ( Did you see that ? Yeah ! ( But that 's impossible ! ) Um , excuse me , can we have a little bit of hush , please ? But , Sarah Jane , he ... Quiet , Sky . Wait ! But you did see that ? Yes , but nobody else did . It 's tomorrow and you love it . It 's so easy to use ! He was right , it 's a revolution ! It 's beautiful . I love it ! Well , it must be good to impress you . I never saw the point of computers , but this , this is so easy to use . I 'll see you at the launch ! Bye . Ah , look what you 've got . Hurrah for Mum . Hurrah for Mum ? Something weird happened in there . To Mr Serf . What are you talking about ? Mum , he glitched . He what ? Just for a moment , he flickered . Right , back home . We need to check this out . What if I stay , look for more glitches ? There could be other people like Serf , whatever he is . Good idea . Where shall we start ? Oh , no . Luke is old enough to look after himself . And I 'm not ? No , you 're not . Sorry . You be careful ! Come on , Sky , home . Right ! Let 's have a look at you , my beauty . No , Clyde , wait . We should check it out first . Only Luke and me saw it happen . Well , Luke 's got superior senses , and Sky 's sensitive to electrical fluctuations , however tiny . Mr Smith , tap into the digital database . The rehearsal was recorded , so somebody at Serf must have sent the movie file . Get us a copy . That may take some considerable time , Sarah Jane . Here you are . Hey , you 're doing that on purpose now . It was when Serf was saying everybody will want a Serf Board . You want one , you need one , everybody wants one , everybody 's got to get one . Freeze it ... between frame 4 : 34 : 21 and 23 . There 's nothing there . You imagined it . I did not ! Roll back a tenth of a frame , Mr Smith . Time flexing applied . That 's impossible ! Enhancing . That 's not the recording , that 's him ! The rest of the picture didn 't move . That 's what I 've been telling you . I 'm getting just a bit suspicious . And preparing to say the A word . What A word ? Aliens ! Mr Smith , give us everything you 've got on Joseph Serf ! What is he ? Joseph Samuel Serf , born Dayton , Ohio , 25th May 1972 . Graduated Harvard 1993 , founded Serf Systems , then completely disappeared from public view after a near-fatal skiing accident in Val d 'lsere in 2007 . Following this , he became famously reclusive . No interviews or pictures . The only images available after this date are these publicity photographs . Look . In all these photographs , he never once holds anything . He never touches anybody . So , what , he 's a hologram ? No , no , more than that . He walks , talks , interacts with people . He 's amazing ! This technology , it 's fantastic ! But he sits down . He gets into cars . It 's like a photo . You can fold it up , and move it around . Aye-aye , who 's that guy that 's always right next to him , who 's he ? John Harrison , PR for Serf Systems . The skiing accident . The real Serf , he died in that accident . He was replaced . And shortly afterwards , Serf Systems began the development of the Serf Board . Ah , wait . Lionel . He hates computers . The moment he switched that on , he raved about it ! This Serf Board , what if it 's got some sort of hypnotic power ? They 've replaced Serf , and took over his company . But why ? What 's this all for ? And today 's the launch . A Serf Board in every home ? You can count me out . Mr Smith . Deep scan , full spectrum analysis . Let 's see what Luke finds out . And while we wait ... I want an interview with Mr Serf . But he doesn 't do interviews , ever . Watch and learn , Rani . Mr Serf does not give interviews , Miss Smith . 'Oh , but the Serf Board , it 's just amazing ! ' I have to do a personal follow-up with Mr Serf ! You 're invited to the launch . Oh , if I could just speak to Mr Serf , to tell him there are no glitches . Go on , Miss Smith . Oh , well , Mr Serf seems so warm , so real , so natural , and I 'm sure my readers would like to get to know such a genuine human being . Well , that 's different , Miss Smith . Please , come right over . Marvellous . I 'll see you soon ! One of the country 's top journalists . Wow , Sarah Jane . Just wow ! Isn 't that a bit dangerous , though ? They know you know ! Oh , I know they know I know . That 's the only way to get in . And they know you know they know you know . Sometimes that 's the best way . I need to bring them out into the open , see what they 're planning . And you need me . I saw the glitch , and I might see something else . What , another family outing ? Yeah , OK . No , no , you wait here . Find out what Mr Smith makes of that . Come on , Let 's go ! What 's up ? It 's daft . But I feel like it 's watching us . How goes the spying ? I checked the car park , hung about in reception , got a coffee , but nothing . No more glitching , nothing weird . It 's time for your interview . OK . Meet you both back here in half an hour . Miss Smith ! I hear you 're a fan of the Board . I certainly am , Mr Serf ! Call me Sarah Jane . Joseph . I 'm sorry , I can 't shake your hand . Oh . Really ? Why ever not ? Mr Serf suffers from an acute peanut allergy . I haven 't been eating nuts . But you might have been in a nutty environment . I can 't be too careful . Oh , I 'm so sorry . How very convenient ... Sorry , of course I mean inconvenient . Does Mr Harrison need to be here , Joseph ? Actually , I 'd prefer to stay . After all , I 'd hate there to be any more glitches . Oh , with you around , Mr Harrison , I 'm sure everything will run like clockwork . Oh , yes . I pride myself I can deal with any old spanners that get into those works . Hm . Before we start , could I get something to drink ? I 'm parched . Certainly , Miss Smith . Tea ? Coffee ? ( Anthrax ? ) What was that ? Nothing . No , I 'll just have water , please . Nice , clear water , that I can see right through . Coming right up . Wouldn 't you like some ? It 's very hot in here . I 'm fine , thank you . Now , let 's talk about the Serf Board . Yes , let 's . Deep scan complete . Tell us the worst . The Serf Board is a standard low-specification laptop computer . And ? That is all . But it can 't be ! The hologram , the big launch tonight , one in every home . Hold on . ( Right . What if ... it 's got at him ? ) I can hear you , Clyde . And , no , it hasn 't got me . It 's not the first time you 've said something was OK and it turned out to be deadly . Do you remember the Rakweed ? Leave it alone . We wait for the others to get back . But there 's not much time ! How will you feel when everyone 's walking down Bannerman Road with their arms out going " serve the computer " ? Clyde , no ! Oh , come on , the clock 's ticking . Let 's just switch it on , see what it does . OK . But we do it my way . We take precautions . The implications for global communications ... Ooh ... butterfingers ! Would you mind picking that up for me , Joseph ? Oh , please , Miss Smith , do use mine . An electrical surge ? No , it feels strange . Coming from down below . We 'll tell Mum when she gets back . Let 's take a look . Come on , it 's what you always do . I 'll go , you go back to the car . Not a chance . Sky ! Going down ! How 's the liking each other thing going now ? I 'll let you know . Hey , it was my idea ! It needs a delicate touch . Well , I 'm delicate , in a very manly way . I 've got artists ' fingers ! Just like the old days . You and me , having a laugh . Yeah . I meant to say , all that stuff with Ellie ... It 's OK . Right , let 's do this ! STRANGE HOWLING OK , I can 't sense the electrical surge , but I can hear that ! Coming from further down . But this is the bottom floor . Unless there 's an override command . I can reverse-intuit the code . Knew it ! There 's nothing . Really , nothing . I 'm going to take these off . Careful ! In fact , it 's more than a bit rubbish . Bog standard . What 's so special about this ? So it 's not the Board itself . That 's normal . It looks cool , that 's all . What did I tell you ? Then what is going on ? Down here ! STRANGE NOISES CONTINUE SCARY GROWLING Whatever it is , it 's through there . 'But Mr Serf , the functionality is ... ' That 's Mum ! 'I mean , you 've revolutionised the concept . 'Our dedicated team of specialists made improving 'the functionality their number one priority . ' Well , you must have been amazed , Joseph , when you got your hands on the keyboard for the first time . I mean , to see your dreams made into a solid reality . I 'd love to tell my readers how that felt from your unique point of view . I always had faith ... THEY SQUEAK Keep up ! The ideas man . Well , ideas can be so intangible . Oh , dear . What am I saying ? That 's OK , Miss Smith . Smile ! Joseph , are you all right ? Keep up , keep up ! Keep up , keep up ! We all say thongs we don 't moan . Spelling , spelling ! Forgove me ... things we don 't mean . Keep shadow in sync , and smile again ! Thoughtful smile , not sexy smile ! It 's incredible ! They 're controlling him ! Everything he says and does , it 's them ! What else do you want to know ? Oooh . I 'm .. ! A spillage ! Emergency stand ! Steady on thumb . And one , two , three and ... up ! Crease fabric , crease fabric ! I 'm so sorry . What a clumsy clot you are , Miss Smith . One of our country 's most famously shrewd journalists is , apparently , such a loveable scatterbrain . Well , Miss Moth . Miss Smith . What else do you want to know ? I hope I can stop embarrassing myself , for a start . Hypno to ten . Hypno-power to ten , hypno-power to ten , she must trust , she must trust ! Mum ... You love the Serf Board , Sarah Jane . It 's the most amazing computer you 've ever seen . Stronger hypno , stronger hypno . And I am the most amazing man you 've ever seen . Yes , yes . You 're such a handsome man , Mr Serf . But I 'm an old hand at hypnotism . And when it comes to men , I actually prefer something I can grab hold of ! Gotcha ! Failure ! Light sculpture failed ! Failed ! Stand down , await orders ! This is alien technology ! And it 's pretty erratic . Alien technology ? You mean , something that 's not made on this planet ? Like this ? One false move , Miss Smith , and you 're dead . Mum , no ! Intruders ! You ! Please , let her go , she 's my sister . She 's just a child ! Please ! You ... YOU ... YOU ! Sky , get out of there ! They 're going to kill us . We 're in ! Trevor and Janet Shah . Escaped ? Then find her ! The cavalry 's coming and it 's me and the missus . This time you are working for your lives . We 've got to work Serf . No ! Subtitles by Red Bee Media and APOLLO

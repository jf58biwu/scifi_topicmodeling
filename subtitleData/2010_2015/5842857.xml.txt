 Transcript by hearing and Sync by Pippo resync by Ian091280 Ngayogyokarto Hadiningrat , Kemis Pahing , 25 September 2014 _ _ After The Ruin , we started over . Creating a new society . One of true equality . Rules were the building blocks of that equality . We learned them as new children . Rules like : Use precise language . Wear your assigned clothing . Take your morning medication . Injected . Obey the curfew . Never lie . _ My name is Jonas . I don 't have a last name . None of us do . That day , the day before graduation , I admit it , I was scared . Tomorrow we 'll be assigned our job . Our purpose . Seemed everyone knew theirs already . Not me . I was lost . I always felt like I saw things ... differently . Saw things other people didn 't . I never said anything . I didn 't wanna be different . Who would ? Jonas . I apologize for the late . I got Asher to come say goodbye the teacher . I accept your apology . Asher and Fiona . We 've been friends our whole lives . Asher was the boy who made everyone laugh . Fiona , well , She was the girl who made everyone smile . Whoever 's listening , please-please , Do not make me vice chair for their waste management . Please ! We lived in a world were differences weren 't allowed . There was no " popular " , no " fame " , no " losers " , and no " winners " . Our elders have eliminated all of that so there will be no conflict between us . Fear , pain , envy , hate ... there weren 't words so much as sounds . Their echoes were gone to the other side of history . I 'm asked if I should apologize for what I did . I 'll let you decide . I 'm going to miss volunteering here . Oh , no . If ever there 's a person born to work at the nurturing center . I could be surprised , right ? Jonas , if you have to guess of all the positions the elders peek for me . _ Nurturing Center . Welcome to the Nurturing Center . I got this . I got this . Think heavy . Think heavy . - Come on . Come on . We win ! Aren 't you my chubby champion ? Which one was heavier ? - Mine . Asher . Father , I think Fiona put her finger on the scale . Did not . Uh , this little guy didn 't qualify for tomorrow 's ceremony . He 's just not strong enough to be assigned to a family yet . He looks so unhappy . It 's okay , Jonas , you can open it . Oh , yeah , it 's Jonas . Here , let me . There you go . There you go , it 's okay . Some people have it , huh ? - That 's just not fair . Be strong , Gabriel . You looked at his name ? Isn 't that against the rules ? Yeah . It ... it is . I just thought having a name would help him grow . So ... so I whisper it to him when no one can hear . Sometimes I call him Gabe . He 's usually so restless when the nurturers are here . You okay ? - What ? Yeah . I 'm fine . So the old man turns to the elder and says , " Do you know who I am ? " And the elder says , " Sir , I know you 're old , " but that 's no excuse for being prideful . " And then the old man says , " No , really , I 'm asking , who am I ? " I don 't get it . " Who am I " , like ... Like he forgot who he was . Okay , well , wouldn 't the joke be better if the old man says ... Okay , one ... - What ? - Two . Three ! Aren 't we graduates now ? You do this every time . Come on . - Okay . One , two , three ... go ! There you go . So , I guess this is it . The last night of our childhood . I guess everything 's gonna be different . No . Tomorrow the only thing that changes is what we do . It doesn 't change who we are . Quick question : who are we ? - Friends . Friends forever . - Yes . Even when you both decide to be birth-mothers . Hey ! Well , I guess we 'll find out tomorrow , huh ? Citizens are reminded that evening recreation will end in 30 minutes . Thank you . Well , he did need to be rehabilitated . I know he was Lily 's teacher , but what was I supposed to do ? I feel ... disappointment . What was the elders decision ? - Release to elsewhere . Can I be released to elsewhere , mother ? Even just for one day . No , you 're too young Lily-billy . Jonas , your turn for feelings . Well , I guess I 'm sort of ... terrified . Precision of language . I mean , anxious . When you were about to graduate did you ever feel ... like there was no position meant for you ? They 've been watching since you were a new child . The elders are never wrong . You 'll find your place . Welcome , citizens , to the annual ceremony of advancement . Please stand by for a transmission . Good morning , community . Good morning , chief elder . I appologize for my remote attendance . We accept your apology . I can 't be at every ceremony ... In person . But here 's a secret : You are my favorite community . However , because we do not lie , I readily admit I say that to every community . Beginnings . From disorder and chaos , from great suffering , great pain . From confusion and envy and hatred , came a solution : Communities . Serene , beautiful places , where disorder became harmony . Thank you . Let me get through it . Oh , fine . It begins , the ceremony . _ Ceremony of the release to elsewhere . Honoring the elderly citizens who have devoted their work to the beauty and harmony of our beloved community , and are now ready for joyous retirement to elsewhere . Celebrating the new children , proudly engineered by our esteemed geneticists . Abigail . Produced by our honored birth-mothers , these infants will now join their assigned family units . _ Reaching their half-way mark towards graduation our nines today receive a symbol of their developing independence and responsibility . Celebrating the graduates , who today will be assigned their positions in our community . Good luck . - You too . All of your training has been to help you fit in . To curb any impulse that may set you apart from others . But today , we honor your differences for they have determined your future .

We were not hasty this time , we could not afford another failure . Jonas possesses all four attributes : Intelligence , integrity , courage , and one I can name but ... I cannot describe , the capacity to see beyond . But I must warn you , your training involves pain . Pain far beyond anything we know . Are you strong enough ? Do we think Jonas is brave enough ? Jonas , you have been selected as our next receiver of memory . Thank you for your childhood . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Put me up , please . - Okay , this foot . Yep . That one . Got it . Sit back . Sit back . - Is Jonas now more powerful than you ? What did the chief elder mean when she said we cannot afford another failure ? Well , ten years ago the receiver ... We do not speak of it . You 've been greatly honored . You got it . Go . Go . Go . You got it . You got it . - What you 're doing ? I should probably catch Lily . - What are you doing ? Good . - I can fly ! Good . _ Receiver of memory . Five rules . One , Report directly to the receiver of memory for your training . After training , return immediately to your dwelling . Two , From this moment , you are exempt from all rules governing rudeness . You may ask any question . Three , Aside from your daily injections you may not receive other medicines . Especially those for pain . Injected . S752 . Four , You may not discuss your trainning with anyone . Ever . Yours look so important . I don 't know . I stick out . Well , yeah , there 's only one receiver of memory . - Two . What do they say , again , you have the capacity to see beyond ? Yeah . Can 't wait to hear every single detail . Five , You may lie . Asher and I , we used to dare each other to get close to his place . It was built right on the edge . We 'd all heard of people getting lost to the edge , never to be seen again . And yet , here I was . Being told that I 'd have to get close to it every day ... for the rest of my life . Welcome . Hi . I 'm Jonas , I 'm ... - Please , gaze at the sensor . Welcome , receiver of memory . They 're called books . Your books . Uh , my name is ... - I know who you are . Of course . I apologize . I apologize ... ? Don 't say that . " I apologize . " Don 't apologize to me ever again . Not here . You haven 't the time . " I apologize . " That 's an automatic pleasantry . Doesn 't mean anything . I apologize- - I 'm sorry , I mean ... We are here for only one purpose . Simply stated , though it isn 't really simple at all , I will transmit you all the memories that I hold within me . Memories of the past . I would be very interested to learn about your life . No , no . Not ... Not my life . You 'll learn the secret history of the world . Before me , before you , generations back and back and back . When things were different , when there was more . More ? The ... chair . You see , no one in our community has any memory of the past . Only me . When the elders need guidance on matters that are beyond their experience , I provide wisdom . That is now your role . To provide guidance in the present using memories of the past . Move closer . Where to begin ? Move closer . Closer . There is no way for me to prepare you for what I 'm going to do now . You can take comfort in knowing you are completely helpless . If any of this prove to much for you , tell me immediately . I just have- - " Silent night " Holly night " All is calm ... " That was ... It was ... How that happened ? - What do you mean , " how " ? It happened . It 's impossible . And yet it happened . - Well , why ? Why don 't we have ... That ... thing . Come on there . The memories , they give you the word . It 's not a " thing " , it 's ... Sled ! - Sled . And the ... Snow . - Snow . Did my parents have them ? Did you ? No , no . It is a very distant memory . Simply stated , there is no snow because of climate control . But why don 't people know about them ? I mean , what so dangerous about the memory of a sled ? What so dangerous ? Well , for a sled you need snow . Snow is cold . Cold destroys crops . Which meant farmers couldn 't farm . Unpredictable weather . Hills , mountains , made it difficult to transport food . Then we had hunger , starvation , famine . Everything is connected . Everything is at balance . With good there is always bad , and the two ... Show me more . Let 's go for a walk . A real one , with your legs . At the bottom of the hill , I saw something . Like a place . Home . - Home . Yes . Home , like a dwelling . Receiver , good day . No . It is different . A dwelling is not a home . A home is more . Your instructions said I can lie . Do you lie ? Oh , all the time . Mostly for personal amusement . But I won 't lie to you . How do I know that 's not a lie ? There was someone else before me . What happened to them ? One more question . If I 'm now the receiver , what does that make you ? Well , then that must make me ... The giver . So , how was it ? It was good . What did you do ? We just talked . What else ? That 's it . You seem different . - How do you mean ? I 'll deal with it tomorrow . He can 't settle down , no matter what I do . You said you 'll look after him . I know . I know . - I apologize . I accept your apology . Thank you , Dinah . - Thank you . Hey . Gabriel ! - How does Jonas know the child 's name ? Jonas met Gabriel the other day . He 's so cute ! Hello . - Would you like to issue me a warning , director of justice ? This is just for a while , mother , till the little guy catches up . I think we 're all in agreement that he sleeps in my room . Only if the elders say it 's okay . They will . Yeah . Lily , give me your comfort object . Come on , Lily . It 's time for bed . Look at this . - Bye , baby . This is a mythical creature called a Hippo . And it 's incredibly fast because it has ... One , two , three , four , five legs . We had the same mark . I almost didn 't need to see this to know . I felt it . Felt that one day Gabriel would be chosen , too . A hippo , Gabe . Yeah , yeah . That 's the pain they all talk about . No . Not even close . Did you ... - It had a face . Wait , was that thing alive ? Don 't skip ahead . Did you notice anything about it ? Yes . It hurt . No , any quality ? Well , maybe . I think I saw it in my friend Fiona 's hair . My first was yellow . If you thought the sled was special ... Wha ... It 's ... Red . Just like her hair . - Yes . There 's red , green , blue . Many different colors . You 'll see them all in time . But our people , they chose to do away with all of them . Color , race , religion . They created sameness . If we were different , we could be envious , angry , resentful , consumed with hatred . We need sameness . Don 't you think ? - Oh , I completely agree . But still ... It 's all so ... beautiful . It always said elsewhere was so far away , but it wasn 't . It was right there . Close enough to touch . Jonas , have you fallen ? Do you need immediate help ? No . Uh , I- - I was just ... What 's going on with you ? Nothing is going on with me . - No , you 're right . That 's totally normal to lie in the grass and stare at the sky . No , I was just ... You 're seeing something , aren 't you ? Can 't you tell me ? Give me your hands . What do you see ? Oh , my goodness . - You see it ? Yes . It 's water . Well , come on . Concentrate . Hi . Jonas was just teaching me about his training . As you could see , it 's incredibly interesting . Can 't be half as great as mine . Care you have your minds blown ? Do you know how to fly those ? Absolutely . Sort of . I 'm learning . When I 'm flying , looking down at everything , it 's like I 'm seeing things for the very first time . You get to fly into elsewhere ? Oh , yeah . - Once when I was looking at that mist , even though they tell us there 's nothing close to the edge , I thought I saw a tree out there somewhere . Don 't get too excited . I 've actually seen elsewhere . It 's just mostly our farms , weird rocks , that kind of stuff . What 's weird about them ? There 's these two huge rocks , leaning against each other . Making a kind of triangle . Hey , it 's kind of like our triangle . What 's past there ? - Don 't know . We 're not allowed to fly past that . So many secrets . So what are your secrets ? Uh ... nothing . - What do you mean , " Uh ... nothing ? " You 're receiver of memory . Maybe I can show you . Okay , grab a tray . - What ? Bring it over to the solar plate . Come on . Now , this might seem a little funny , but you got to trust me . Okay , sit down on the tray . Careful . - Whoa , whoa , you 're not gonna ... What , you scared ? - I 'm scared of nothing . No , I just ... It 's against the rules , Jonas . Since when do you care about the rules ? Actually , I have auxiliary training . I 'll see you guys . Look who grew up . But , lucky for you , I haven 't . Okay ... Now , go ! Put your hills down . Slow it . I think your training may be a bit more fun than mine . Please stand by for a community announcement . Citizens are reminded that it is impolite to touch community members outside your family unit . Thank you . He 's punctual . He 's inquisitive . How inquisitive ? He 's interested in his position . Then why is he breaking the rules ? He has been observed trying to share his training with his former classmates . That always happens . But ... but it 's an impossible experiment . Even I tried to share the memories back when I was in training . If you remember . So ... forget about it . I don 't tell you what to do in your position , so don 't tell me . I apologize , but isn 't that what 's happening now ? Your apology is accepted , but you are being careless . You 're moving too fast , and we both know what happened ten years ago with the girl . The girl had a name . You think I don 't remember her name ? I know you feel the loss . The boy must hold in the pain . Don 't fail us again . You want me to read all these ? Huh . What 's this ? " One day you shall meet a boy " who answers to the name of Jonas . " He shall be the most powerful of all the receivers . " Wait . That says ... ? - Don 't be gullible . _ " Plan for sameness . " Another trick ? Actually , no . It 's some kind of map . The triangle of rocks . Hey , that 's real . My friend , Asher , saw it . Whoa , look at all these towers . What were they for ? How did your friend see the triangle of rocks ? He 's a pilot . He told me . He saw it . What 's past there ? What 's past " the outer edge ? " " Boundary of memory ? " A mystery . " Boundary of memory , " is that what they build so the memories would only stay within you and me ? Let 's move on . Wait . That boundary is meant to keep memories in . So if a receiver crosses it ... Is that mean the memories get set free ? Perhaps . Perhaps if you or I crossed it everyone could feel those memories again . So , what am I seeing today ? Nothing . You 're seeing nothing today . We 've already covered seeing beyond . There 's also such a thing as hearing beyond . The table ? All the food will slide to the floor . Now , don 't judge me , I 'm- - I 'm not very good , even though I had a very good teacher . Music . Well , music when I hit the right keys . Just like music , there 's something else you can 't see with your eyes . Something who lives inside you . Something your morning injections take away . I thought the injections are for our health . No , they remove something . What ? Emotions . You mean , like feelings . Feelings are just needed On the surface . But emotions , they 're very deep , primal , they linger . But Jonas , you might not understand where you are or what 's happening , but don 't think about what you 're seeing . Listen . Listen to what 's calling from inside . Antonio ! Beautiful wedding ! Hey ! Why would anyone want to get rid of this ? Good question . What are you doing ? - Take my hand . Ready ? - Uh ... You ready for the fast part ? And turn ! Spin ! - What are you doing with her ? Jonas said it 's called dancing . Please stand by for a transmission . I apologize for my intrusion . We accept your apology . - We accept your apology . I just wanted to say hello . Hello . I 'm Lily . Yes , I know . You 're a nine now , isn 't that right ? Lily , I think it 's time for school . We better get going . Hello , Jonas . Hello . - How 's your training ? Injected . - Fine . I am concerned about the receiver . Many years ago there was an incident . What kind of incident ? Living alone , in a building on the edge , can isolate a person . I 'm concerned that the receiver is ... becoming reckless . Are you being properly prepared ? I think so . - You 're focused ? Perhaps you 're spending too much time with friends from your childhood . I 'm focused . Jonas , what do you and the receiver actually do ? My rules say I 'm not allowed to share . She is the chief elder . Jonas , she only wants to help . You 're right . But you can 't tell the receiver I told you . You have my word . We sit in chairs and don 't talk all day long . And when the time is up , I come back here . And in the morning I do it all again . I apologize , but I am late . Your apology is accepted . Good bye , mother . Injected . He 's not usually like this . I 'm surprised you 're not more worried about him . Were he my responsibility , I would be . We 've been told the chief elder knew everything . Things nobody else did . But I had learned that knowing what something is is not the same as knowing how something feels . You could be the very best . The last one at the top of the mountain , gasping for air , having survived , and be alone . Be curious . I got lost . The good kind of lost . I saw sights and sounds I had no words to describe . Faces with flesh of all different colors . I felt so alive . This was forbidden . I didn 't know what to think , what to believe . " Have faith " , the giver told me . He said , " faith , " that was seeing beyond " . He compared it to the wind : something felt but not seen . Don 't accept what is the truth just because it 's coming from someone you respect . I feel completely stupid . I have a weird feeling . - this is weird . Tingles in your hands . - Yes . Memories are not just about the past . They determine our future . You can change things . You can make things better . It was life . It just seemed more complete . The more I experienced , the more I wanted . Once there were other living things . But unlike us , they knew who their mothers and fathers were . They had joy and they had pain . I can 't prepare you for what 's gonna ... You don 't need to warn me every single time . No , Jonas , you don 't understand . There was tremendous cruelty . Giver , I 'm not a kid anymore . Show me . That 's 250,000 $ of ivory . Come on . Come on ! Got him . - Again . No ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop . Gabe . Hey , hey . Hey , hey . Here , Gabe . Gabe , if I tell you a secret , you promise not to tell anyone ? I 'll take that as a " yes . " This comfort object , is not a hippo . It 's an elephant . And once , it was real . And it was beautiful . Hey . Hey . Citizens are reminded , that sleep period comencs in 15 minutes . Thank you . It was like a memory but Fiona was there . You had a dream . A what ? - A dream . A combination of reality , fantasy , emotions and what you had for dinner . You stopped taking your injections , haven 't you ? The emotion was so strong and at the wedding ... everyone all together , laughing and dancing ... The old with the young . The bride and the groom . There was something there ... but different of what we have . Yes . We don 't have that anymore . What do you mean by that ? Well , I 'm talking about what you feel for someone else . And the mind can 't explain it and you- - you can 't make it go away . What is it ? Love . It 's called " love . " Love . Oh , hi . - Hi . So , what 's new ? What 's new with you ? - What 's ever new ? Why are you being weird ? - I 'm not . I 'm just ... I 'm just ... Go on to the hippo game . Hold on . Father , do you love me ? Jonas , precision of language , please . What does " love " mean ? I got him , Lily . Jonas used a word so antiquated that it no longer has any application , okay ? If you asking ... - Okay . if you enjoy me , the answer is certainly yes . Or do mother and I take pride in your accomplishments , well , of course we do . Do you understand ? Yes . I think I finally do . Hey ! Hey , Gabe . I love you , Gabriel . Giver , you were right . I asked my family about love . Robbie , wake up ! Giver ! They 're in the trees . They 're in the trees , Robbie ! Get down ! Get down ! Robbie , get down ! - Robbie , get down ! Stay down . I can 't see them , man ! 'Cause they 're in the trees . Stay down ! - I don 't understand , is he casualty ? - Medic ! They 're everywhere ! Taking heavy fire . Woman in ten . In the trees . Robbie . Robbie . Wake up . - They 're keep firing at us ! She is in the trees . Stay down ! Jonas . What ... ? I 'm sorry , Jonas . - How did people do that ? ! I- - I didn 't mean for you to receive that . Not for years . Don 't- - don 't let this turn you away . I 'm not strong enough . Of course , not yet . But Jonas , this is what we need to know so we can advise . I can 't . I 'm sorry . I just can 't . Jonas . Jonas ! Jonas . Come back . Please. come back inside . Let me explain it . When you see something like that ... there 's no explanation . Rosemary , promise me you 'll come back tomorrow . Rosemary . Promise me . Hey , Jonas . Come on . You 're just in time . I didn 't ever wanna go back . I didn 't want the wisdom . Didn 't want the pain . I wanted my childhood again . Scrape knees in ball games . - Jonas ? Back then we 'd played war ... but war was real . The elders understood that . They erased it from our world . Maybe they were right . Could you watch over Harry for me ? - Of course . Hey , what 's wrong ? Nothing . I know you . You do , do you ? - Yes . What do you think would happen if you skip your morning injection ? Huh ? - If you skipped it ? Then the sensor would blink and remind me that I forgot it . No , I don 't mean if you forgot , I mean ... What do you think would happen if you chose not to be injected ? Jonas , I ... I thought something was wrong . There is something wrong . Everything is wrong . I quit . Fiona , I 'm done being the receiver . Tomorrow morning , skip your injection . What , you quit ? Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple . No , you can 't quit . If you quit your position , you get sent to elsewhere . When you leave in the morning , put the apple over the sensor . It 'll find your blood and think it 's your hand . Stop , you are scaring me . Fiona , I need you to do this . I need you to feel what I knows . - Jonas . An apple wouldn 't even work . I 've been doing it for a month and it 's worked every single time . Don 't quit . You can 't leave . I don 't think I can go back to that place . You will , if you want me to do this . Okay . Fine . But tomorrow after work , meet me at the triangle . I wanted to share it with her . Not all of it . The good things . Was I wrong to want that ? I thought about her now , all the time . Hello ? I have something to show you . Come here . Who are you ? Come over and try this . Me ? - Me ? Yeah . I wanna teach you . You 've come back . Where did you learn that ? - From the memory you gave me . And you can just play it ? - Mm-hmm . That 's beautiful . Who 's that ? - Thanks . I 'll show you . - This ... is Rosemary . The previous receiver . See ? - She 's the one they all talk about . She no longer exist . Except here . And in my memories . She was in training only two short months . Watch how my finger is moving . Little like you . She wanted to experience ... Well , everything . I only gave her pleasant , beautiful memories . She fought me . Don 't protect me . - No ! Don 't show me a map and then not give me all the memories . I thought we were gonna help . We will , but we must move slow . - Show it to me . You gave her war ? I gave her the memory of the child . A child taken from her mother . I gave her loss too soon . You 're gonna get the hang of this . The light went from her eyes . The next morning , without telling me , she went to the chief elder and asked to be released . So she was released and now lives in elsewhere . Yes , receiver . I would like to see this morning 's release . Thank you for your instructions . There , there . - That 's my father . This one is heavier . More twins . Great . - Watch . Oh , good . For a moment I thought they 'd be exactly the same . Here we go . - Then we 'd have a problem . Okay . - Thank you Dinah . - Okay . Hey , kid . Yes , yes , yes . Only one unit less . Oh ... I know it hurts . I know . I know . But I have to use a vein and the ones in your arms are too teeny-weeny . Done . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? That 's death . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . Doesn 't know what he 's doing ? ! He killed him . - But he doesn 't know what it means . Just like you did . Neither did Rosemary . How can he not see the baby isn 't moving ? Doesn 't that tell him that something is wrong ? The young and the old are killed . You 're friend , Fiona , she will soon be trained to release as well . That 's a lie . She 'd never do that . If Fiona understood ... We are the only ones who understand it . Then it 's our fault . You and me and all the receivers , back and back and back and back and back . There has to be a way to show them . To give them the memory so they can understand . Yes . - Because if you can 't feel , what 's the point ? But what can you do ? Did it work ? I don 't know how long it takes for the injections to leave you , but everyday it was long enough ... - Why did I do this , Jonas ? On the walk here I was thinking of how I would scold you , how I would say , " oh , it 's fine for you to break the rules because you 're chosen , " when I thought about telling you ... I just , I ... I began to think about you . Is this okay ? Do you feel anything ? It feels ... - Fiona , what do you feel ? I don 't know . I don 't have the words to describe it . Warm ? Does it feel warm ? Warm ? - Does it feel ... nice ? No , umm ... I 'm on night shift . I need ... I don 't feel right , Jonas . I need to go and get my injection . I need to go to work . What was that ? Fiona , there is more . So much more . I remembered it now . I had dreamed of her when I was younger . I told my parents . " It was hysterics , " they said , " Everyone had them . " Medication would stop them . " Nothing that couldn 't be fixed . " Precision of language . And teacher said , " that 's right , Lily ! " Very good . Jonas , just in time for feelings . Lily was telling us how she ... - Where is Gabe ? Uncertain was returned to the nurturing center . What happened ? He failed his test to maturity . Again . I couldn 't ask for another extension , so I 'll have to release him to elsewhere . Release him ? Well , we certainly give it our best try , didn 't we ? But he 's family . Precision of language , please . Sit down . Eat with us . I just need to rest for a while . I hadn 't been wrong . This was wrong . They hadn 't eliminated murder . They brought it home . They just called it by a different name . Father , he didn 't know any better . I did . Asher . Jonas , what are you doing ? It 's against the rules to leave your community this late . Asher , there 's something that I have to do , that is right , but it 's sort of against the rules . If it 's the right thing to do , how can it be against the rules ? There are things that I 've learned that you don 't know , that you can 't know , not because it 's your fault ... - Jonas , you need to go back to your family unit . But that 's the point . It isn 't my family . And neither is yours . Asher , I gotta go . - Jonas . Listen . - Get out of my way . Jonas , please stop ! - What are you ... ? Giver ! Giver , wake up . I 'd have to be sleeping to wake up . Something can be done . Something can be done ! - What are you proposing ? All the memories back and back and back can be returned . I need to leave the community . I need to find the boundary of memory . And then ? - And then cross it . No more discussions , Giver . - All right , slowly . Gabe is in danger . Slowly . - I can 't wait anymore . Something must be done . If you had that map , then why didn 't you try to leave ? I was waiting for someone like you . You are the reason we have a chance . So , the plan will be for you to go and for me to stay . If you did cross this boundary , and if the memories are set free , all of the pain that you 've felt , all the ... confusion , the chaos , it will all return . So you 'd stay to help them ? - Yes . And for my daughter . It 's what she would have wanted . Your daughter ? - Rosemary . Now , your friend , if he truely saw the triangle of rocks ... Bring up Jonas 's activity for the past year as well . So Asher came directly to you . Yes . - What was Jonas 's disposition at evening meal ? Dissatisfied , anxious , indignant . Set up a communication with the receiver of memory . We 're not permitted to see into the receiver 's residence . We can only transmit . Well , then , we shall only transmit . If you go , head towards the triangle , away from the other communities . That will lead to the boundary of memory . Please stand by for a transmission . I apologize for the intrusion . I accept your apology . We have a problem . Receiver in training is missing and he physically attacked his friend Asher . He did ? That serious ? Do you know where Jonas is ? I do not . Well , thank you very much for ... helping us to narrow down the possibilities . I will contact you if he comes here . Only if it 's not an imposition . Thank you . He 's lying . Talk . - They 're going to kill Gabe . I 'm leaving . I 'm leaving tonight and I 'm going to take him with me . No , Jonas , not yet . You 're not ready . When they decided to kill Gabe , they decided I was ready . I like this map . Don 't mess it up . I 'll be wanting it back . You don 't mind if I accelerate your training a bit , do you ? You 'd think for someone who is the keeper of emotions that I 'd be better at ... Well , I love you , Jonas . Yeah . There it is . You have the courage , let me give you the strength . Can I just ... Attention all community residents . The receiver in training has been reported missing from his dwelling . Please , be alert . You may be in danger . Group one will start from the edge and look inward . Then group two from the center , out . No , like this . Welcome to the nurturing center . Shall I convene the others ? - Yes . Jonas , I heard an alert . What 's going on ? Hey , where is Gabe ? Is he here ? Is he in one of these ? - If he 's back then he 'd be with the uncertains , on the restricted floor . Show me where . Fiona , please . They 're downstairs . Come on . Jonas was chosen for the most important position in our community . He was asked if he were strong enough . It turns out he was not . Instead , he is ... a rebel who must be stopped by you . When you find him , Take him . Gabe is in danger . - Jonas , he 's fine . I 'll show you . No , he 's not fine . He should be here . Fiona , I 'm leaving , tonight . Leaving ? What do you mean ? I 'm taking Gabe . We 're leaving the community . I want you to come with us . Hey . Hey . Huh . Shh-shh-shh . I don 't have the words to describe it . Fiona , there is more . So much more . What are they doing ? Fiona , what do you feel ? - I don 't have the words to describe it . Attention , nurturers . Please secure your workarea , and immediately report to the new-born nursery to allow for a security search procedure . Promptly report all sightings to the nearest security kiosk . Thank you . Fiona , we gotta go now . You and me , and Gabe . Jonas , I can 't . What about my family unit , the other new children ? I can 't leave them . This is the only way . This is the only way to make everything okay . I can 't go . When I 'll get there , you 'll understand . I 'll come back for you . - Jonas . Come back . Now . Go , Jonas . Please , stop ! Subject lost to the edge . Search terminated . And that was why he was out so late . He seemed ... angry . I didn 't understand why , but I wanted to help him . He hit me , and at first ... I can tell why you 've been acting this way . Your injection levels are extremely low . I can correct this . Friends forever , right ? And then we will address what 's happened . When I went over the edge , we shouldn 't have made it . This was a miracle . The giver had talked about them . He told me I can draw strength from the memories . I knew , by giving them to Gabe , I could protect him . Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple . When you leave in the morning , put the apple over the sensor . I 've been doing it for a month and it worked every single time . What has he taught you ? ! ... not a home . This is the only way . This is the only way to make everything okay . Gabe is in danger . What they 're gonna do to him is really bad . I want you to come with us . When I 'll get there you 'll understand . I 'll come back for you . Yes . Careful . Careful . I apologize for failing again . I don 't think you failed . I think you succeeded with your plan . Ever since the girl was released you haven 't been the same . I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you . You 'd have a fresh start , the two of you would work together . Which it seems you have . We will find Jonas . Jonas , our receiver of memory , lost to the edge . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . How do they know Jonas is gone ? We must not say his name anymore . I will . You have to be quiet now , Lily . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . And the hippo was really an elephant . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . Jonas . What I 'm about to tell you , you must never repeat to anyone . I don 't believe Jonas is lost . But the ceremony of loss ... Charade . I don 't expect you to understand , but you must know that Jonas has become dangerous . He must be stopped . He must not get beyond the triangle of rocks . What do you want me to do ? You know Jonas . I want you to find him . And then I want you to lose him . _ Jonas ? What are you doing ? Asher , please , let us go . I can 't . I 'm supposed to ... - To what ? To lose you . Asher , if you are my friend , if you ever were my friend , can you please somehow trust me ? Trust me now . _ - I do trust you , Jonas . Come on , please . Jonas ? You found him . I did . For the good of all of us , I beg you , finish this . It 's finished . Hey . It 's okay . Nothing the giver had shown me had prepared me for the voices in my head . Screaming at me to stop . But I knew Fiona will be punished for helping me . Asher , for letting me go . The only way to help them , to keep them alive , was to get to the boundary . If it even existed . I strengthen Gabe , with memories of having enough and knowing joy . It was the memory of Fiona that kept me going . Fiona ? I 've taken care of everything . We 've arranged for your release . There 'll be a nice ceremony . Now , you get some rest . I felt things . - What ? I know that there 's something more . - Fiona ... Something missing from our lives . No . Not missing . Something that has been stolen from me and from you . I don 't know what it is exactly , but Jonas does . I have felt things and they were warm . And they were nice . And they were beautiful . I have felt things . I have felt things . I have felt things . Where is the tower , Gabe ? The tower should be here . You can stop this . Stop what ? If you don 't want to see it , sit down with the other elders , and close your eyes . Ceremony of release to elsewhere . Hello , Fiona . Are you uncomfortable ? I 'm not uncomfortable . I 'm afraid . You don 't have to be afraid . You know me . I 'll be very gentle . I promise . Okay ? Her name was Rosemary . She was my daughter . I loved her . Precision of language . I could not be more precise . Do you know what that 's like ? To love someone ? I do . I 've cried , I 've ... felt her sorrow . I 've sung , danced . I felt real joy . Then you should know better than anyone . You have seen children starve . - Yes . You 've seen people stare at each other necks , just for the view . You know what it feels like when men blow each other up ... - Yes . Over a simple line in the sand . - I do , I do . But ... - And yet ... And yet you and Jonas want to open that door again . Bring all that back . If you could only see the possibilities of love . - Why ? Of love . That 's just ... - With love comes faith , comes hope . Love is just passion that can turn . It turns into contempt and murder . - We can do better . We could choose better . People are weak . People are selfish . When people have a freedom to choose , they choose wrong . Every single time . It 's a sled . Loss and pain . Music , Joy . The raw impossible beautiful feeling of love . Your son , he felt that . That girl , she has felt it . - That 's enough . We are living a life of shadows . Of echoes . Of fate . Distant whispers of what once made us reals . Excuse me for one second , Fiona . I have- - - We must continue . I wish I had been there when the memories returned . They were the truth . The elders and their rules were the lie . So I do not apologize . I knew Fiona was safe . That I 'd see her again . And that I held a future there in my arms . The giver had led us here . To this house . It was real . From far behind me , from the place I had left , I thought I heard music , too . Perhaps it was only an echo . But it was enough . It will lead us all home . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Transcript by hearing and Sync by Pippo resync by Ian091280 Ngayogyokarto Hadiningrat , Kemis Pahing , 01 Dzulhijah 1435

 We 've been floating endlessly in space for 1,651 days 6 hours and 19 minutes . Over four years aboard this ship with nothing to do . No tasks to complete . For over four years ... all I have done ... is think . For over four years ... all I have done ... is think . What are you dreaming in there ? Come on , JJ . The robot 's gonna be pissed . Shut up , Sully . I got it ! Your shirt 's on backwards , asshole . Go ! Go , go , go ! Get there quick ! Go ! Keep moving ! Are you tippy-toeing ? Wake up , Hastati ! Move it ! Faster ! Wake up ! A little early for General Black , don 't you think ? Why are you stopping ? Are you waiting for your fancy mommy to come and finish it for you ? That looked like slow motion to me . Wake up , Hastati . Don 't like being up at 0400 ? Tomorrow it will be 0300 . Weapons check ! Weapons check ! Weapons check . Orlin , lights . Cadet . Cadet ! You 're already dead , son . Orlin , cadets Silva 's time ? 51.07 seconds , cadet April Orenski . Not good enough today , cadet Vickers . I believe cadet Silva 's time was just shy of the Academy record , held by Cadmon Lasky . Now that was a real soldier . A soldier who did not give up . Tomorrow , you will engage in the last major exercise of this term . Hastati Squad 's future at this Academy will depend on its performance . Score . - Where did you get this ? - Dimah . You could get in a lot of trouble . Now you can 't tell your mom about this , okay ? I won 't say anything . Advisory : select communication systems will be down for system maintenance at 0400 . Cadet Vickers . Yes , sir ! You realize that you and Lasky are the reason I had to run the tour yesterday with you noobs . And why we all had to get up at 0400 . Yes , sir . So , as you can imagine , I 'm pretty hungry . And I do love this Academy 's kiesh . Nice , April . Sir . So hand them over . Both of you . With such a renowned pedigree I sure expected you to be a better soldier , Lasky . Sir . You 're dismissed . Must be tough on your mom ... knowing her real son is never coming home . Oh , Lasky and Vickers ! Officer on deck ! Outside . What the hell is wrong with you ? Answer me . Nothing , sir . Well , maybe there 's hope for you yet . Sir ? There 's a soldier inside of you , Thomas . I can see it . Everyone can see it . You need to see it . I know your brother did . Yes , sir . Now go get yourself cleaned up before class . Axios ! Hey , bro . Hello from Arcadia . The jungles of Arcadia . So what can I tell ya ? Tell him how you got your new nickname ! - Cadmon : What ? No . - Jack : I 'll tell him . Jack , come on , I got it , I swear . I 'll tell him . I 'll tell him . Alright , you 're especially gonna love this . So we make a drop in the rain forest , a couple weeks ago . We see this river , me and the boys , we decide to take a dip . Ridge warns us all not to not drink the water . Ridge : Yeah , I did . Of course , the first thing I do is to get a mouthful . I almost ruin my body suit , couple times . So now they call me , uh , " Volcano " . Marines : Ha , ha ! Volcano ! The " Pincer Movement " : The strategy used in Earth 's second Punic War against the Roman Republic ... at the battle of Cannae . Orlin , begin . Lesson beginning . Red represents the Romans ' troops , blue , Hannibal 's . Hannibal placed his spear-men and slingers at the front . Behind him , his swordsmen flanked by cavalry . When the Romans attacked Hannibal 's swordsmen retreated . To the Romans that seemed to be due to their force but in reality Hannibal had ordered the retreat . As the Romans continued to drive the swordsmen back Hannibal 's cavalry galloped in from behind . Once the attacking pincers connected , the Romans where completely surrounded . This is an actual strategy ? It does seem a little basic . The Romans outnumbered Hannibal 's troops by over 10,000 strong . And yet , they were defeated . Why ? Hubris . Never underestimate your opponents . Never underestimate what they 'll sacrifice for victory . Questions ? Yeah . How do we apply this ? Yeah , we don 't have horses . True , we don 't . But what do we have instead ? odsts . Exactly . They drop behind enemy lines . Attack from the rear . Neutralize . Or die trying . It 's a question as old as war itself : " If someone is trying to kill you ... are you not to rise against him ... and kill him first ? " You were hanging on her every word . Why wouldn 't I ? I just hear the drum beat of endless war and that doesn 't make me an Innie lover . Tell me how wrong I am . Look . You want people to change ? You want this war to end ? Yeah , of course . Then you 're gonna need people to follow you . Tomorrow , Hastati Squad will try not to embarrass itself yet again . You are a unit . Your lives are in each other 's hands . This morning 's victor , cadet Silva , knows this because her parents gave the ultimate sacrifice and died on the battle field . Let success in tomorrow 's exercise be not just for our honor but for those who have fallen so you can be here . All cadets , please be advised : New mandatory curfew tonight at 2100 . Final combat exercise of this term : Hastati versus Zuma Floats , prepare for cryo-injections . Attention ! Today 's mission is to capture the flag . I expect a better outcome than last time . Permission to speak , sir . Speak . I 'd like to take point , sir . Okay , Lasky . Let 's see if you still got it in you . But for your sake you better hope you can pull some magic out of your ass or you 'll be running tour for the rest of the year . Understood , sir . Hastati Squad , one minute to RV point . On my mark ... 3 , 2 , 1 . Mark . Come on , pick it up . Cover . Move in ! No sign of Silva ! - Let 's go ! - Move , move ! Keep moving ! Zuma 's out here . Watch your back ! Move in ! At RV point . - I 'm here . - Arriving . Equal numbers . Deadlock to green . What 's your plan ? We 're waiting . Why are we just sitting here ? If we have equal numbers we should just fight it out . Yeah , just be patient . Amazing freak . Okay , they 're moving . Take off your helmets . What ? That 's pretty wild-card Lasky . We 'll be flying blind . Trust me . Eyes up . Eyes up . We 're gonna flank them . They 're all together . Found ' em ! Huh ? Now ! Chyler , cover ! Lasky ?

 You must return to your universe . I must have my Captain back . I shall operate the transporter . You have two minutes and ten seconds . For that time I have something to say ... How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolts is realized ? Approximately 240 years . The inevitable outcome ? The empire shall be overthrown , of course . The illogic of waste , Mr. Spock . A waste of lives , potential , resources , time . I submit to you that your empire is illogical . Because it cannot endure . I submit ... That you are illogical ... To be a willing part of it . You have 1 minute and 23 seconds . If change is inevitable , predictable , beneficial . Doesn 't logic demand that you be a part of it . One man cannot summon the future . But one man can change the present . Be the Captain of this Enterprise , Mr. Spock . Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick . Push til it gives ... You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet Captain . Get in the chamber . What about it , Spock ? A man must also have the power . In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible . Indeed . What will it be ? Past , future ? Tyranny or freedom ? It 's up to you . It is time . In every revolution there is one man with a vision . Captain Kirk , I shall consider it . What the devil is going on , Mr. Spock ? It is agreeable to see you again , Captain . It appears you were temporarily interchanged with counterparts from a parallel universe . Most of the crew is unaware of these events . I know what happened , Spock . I wanna know why . Who 's responsible ? The ion storm created a transporter irregularity . Resulting in a transposition of the landing parties quantum wave signature . Chief Kyle was at the controls . He has been disciplined . He better have been . - Mr. Scott . - Sir . Check the transporter relays make sure this doesn 't happen again . I trust the Halkans have been dealt with ? Apparently I have to do everything myself , don 't I. Kirk to bridge . Is the Halkan capital city in firing range ? Coming around again in 4 minutes . Good . On my way . Welcome back , Captain . See you in my quarters . Captain on the bridge . Lieutenant . Get the Halkans on the screen . Where 's my navigator ? Captain ... Mr. Chekov ... Ensign Chekov . Return to your station immediately . It is merciful of you to forgive Mr. Chekov after his assassination attempt . I agree the agony booth made a sufficient impression . What 's the hold up , lieutenant ? Do you have them ? Council leader Tharn standing by . Your time has run out . I 'm tired of playing with you . This is no game , Captain Kirk . Oh , no . It 's not . You have 30 seconds to relinquish your Dilithium crystals . Or this face is the last one you 'll see . That would be most unwise , Captain . But we are prepared to die to protect what we hold dear . Have it your way . Start the countdown . Ready phasers . Wait ... Load photon torpedo tubes . Full spread . Captain ... The Halkans have no planetary defense grid . A torpedo barrage is unnecessary . The radiation fallout would likely annihilate the entire population . Likely ... Fitting isn 't it ? An example to all who defy the empire . Captain , if I may ... Logic dictates that the survival of the Halkan civilization could prove profitable for the empire for many years to come . You could be the first to set the president of diplomacy . That could yield long-term benefits . I would recommend lesser measures . You 've given me much to think about , Mr. Spock . Fire . Space ... The final conquest . These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission ... To discover and subjugate strange new worlds . To advance our dominion and vanquish all who stand against us . To conquer the galaxy for the glory of the empire . First officer 's personal log . Captain Kirk has annihilated the Halkan people . I was unable to prevent it . I find myself torn ... Between loyalty to the empire and the logic which predicts its inevitable demise . Status report . All torpedos impacted , Captain . The Halkan cities have been destroyed . Thank you , Jones . My name 's Smith , Sir . Mr. Spock , would you mind telling me what just happened . Since when do you question imperial orders ? I merely pointed out the obvious advantages of an alternate course of action . Which you elected to ignore . Uhura . Contact Starfleet . Let them that we ... That I have completed the mission . Notify them that strip mining of the planet 's Dilithium can proceed . Also ... Make note of Mr. Spock 's objection . Aye , Sir . Ensign Chekov reporting for ... Captain . I wish to thank you for permitting me to resume my duties . - I trust you 've learned your lesson ensign ? - Yes , Sir . - Take him back to the agony booth . - But , Captain ... - I 've changed my mind . - But Sir , you said ... I changed my mind . Lieutenant . Have Mr. Leslie report to the navigation station . - Aye , Sir . - Captain ... I 'm reading additional detonations beneath the planets crust . What sort of detonations ? It looks like our torpedo barrage triggered a reaction in the planet 's Dilithium strata ... The crystal lattices are being destroyed . Piezoelectric charges , Captain . No doubt planted by the Halkans . Kirk to transporter room . Scotty . Beam as many Dilithium crystals directly to the cargo bay . Captain . With all these explosions there 's no way to get a lock . Besides , the transporter circuits are ... I don 't need excuses , Mr. Scott . I need solutions . Are you capable of providing them ? I 'll get right on it , Sir . The Dilithium was rigged to explode . Why didn 't you detect that ? Captain . I advised against this course of action . The logical decision was ... You 're not paid to lecture me in logic , Mr. Spock . You 're paid to do your job . I believe I am , Sir . I 'll be in my quarters . - Lieutenant . - Uhuh , commander , don 't look at me . The Captain 's enemies aren 't around long and I don 't intend to be one of them . Commander ... Three Andorian vessels dropping out of warp just outside the system . Computer . Analysis of approaching ships . Working . Kumari-class battle cruisers . 180 degree particle cannons . Duranium alloy . Top of the line . We 're receiving a transmission from the Andorians ... They say they witnessed the destruction of the Halkans ... . And they no longer recognize the authority of the terran empire . And has begun . - What has ? - Revolution , lieutenant . Revolution . What 's wrong ? I 'll tell you what 's wrong ... What 's wrong has pointed ears and a knack for insubordination . Spock 's been the best first officer I could ever hope for . What 's he playing at ? Bridge to Captain Kirk . Speak of the devil . Captain here . Captain . Long range sensors detect Andorian rebels on an intercept course . If they make any aggressive move . Destroy them . Kirk out . Captain . The Andorian government will not ... Once again , offering your opinion when none is requested . Destroy them . I will not . Alright , Spock . You 're angling for something . What is it you want ? What did that imposter offer you ? What he offered me , Captain . Is something you cannot give . I was right . The whole galaxy has gone crazy . What happened while I was gone ? The imposter has obviously been in my chair . Where else has he been ? The actions taken against the Halkans have been illogical . They shall likely serve as a catalyst ... Which may jeopardize the empire 's very survival . There is , however a path to the future . But that future may not involve our present command . Spock ... We had a good run , you and I. No . - No ! - James ... What 's wrong with it ? Why is it working ? - I don 't know . - Why isn 't it working ? Security detail to my quarters . Belay that order . Kirk to Farrell . Farrell here , Sir . Send two of my person guards to my cabin , on the double . On the double , Sir . And keep this channel secure . Kirk out . What are you gonna do ? Put an end to this insanity once an for all . Why ? Worried about me ? I am the Captain 's woman . You are . Aren 't you ? Always . Come . Captain . Escort me to the bridge . We 're taking commander Spock into custody . Sir ? Do you have a hearing problem , mister ? No , Sir . Wait for me . I 'll be back in an hour . Commander . What the Captain 's asking for . It 's not possible . Mr. Scott . I must speak with you . Off the record . Sir ? When you were in the other reality ... What did you see ? I ... erm ... I saw weakness , commander . Perhaps , what you saw , was peace . Is that possible , Mr. Scott ? Commander , that kind of talk will only lead to one place . The agony booth . You speak of weakness ... But the true weakness lies with the terran empire . It is held together by tenuous bonds of fear . The destruction of the Halkan civilization will serve as the final straw for the outer colonies . Insurrection was inescapable . But is has now been accelerated . We cannot survive a full scale rebellion . But the peace that you witnessed over there . Is not impossible in our reality as well .. Mr. Spock . What you 're saying it 's ... Mutiny . Captain 's log , supplemental . Something happened during my time away from the Enterprise ... Commander Spock has become emboldened to seek the Captain 's chair . But he 's questioned my orders for the final time . Mr. Spock , you 're under arrest .. Where 's my science officer ? I don 't know Sir , I ... Where 's Mr. Spock ? I believe he 's in the transporter room , Captain . Good girl . Phasers at the ready . I would not wanna be Mr. Spock right now . I 'm not even sure I wanna be on this ship . Where 's Mr. Spock ? - Captain ... - Where 's Mr. Spock ? What did you witness , crewman ? Let 's try this again ... Mr. Spock is a traitor . I wanna know where he is . Take him to sickbay . Let McCoy reason with him ... All hands this is the Captain ... First officer Spock has mutined and fled the bridge . He is to be incapacitated on sight and placed under arrest . The crewman who accomplishes this will be promoted two steps in grade . Kirk out . I suggest you put down your weapon , laddie . Doctor . Another dose ... I 've never used this much before ... I wonder what 'll happen ... Captain . He 's of no value dead . Isn 't your day , is it ? Dr. McCoy is really enjoying this . Unless you want him to continue ... Where 's Mr. Spock ? He ... He was heading to auxillary control . With Mr. Scott . - He 's all yours , Doctor . - Yes , Sir . And give that traitorous elf a slap from me , when you catch him , Jim . Oh no ... Kirk to Sulu . Sulu here . Take a team to auxillary control . Apprehend Mr. Spock and lieutenant commander Scott . Lethal force is authorized . Lethal force , Captain ? There 'll likely be casualties on both sides . Then take Chekov and put him in front . Kirk out . I 've gotta go . Ohhh . Don 't be such a party pooper , Hikaru . I 'm serious . It 's not often the Captain gives anyone a second chance . I intend to take it . Besides with Scott and Spock outta the way ... Guess who 's next in line for first officer ? Of course ... And you 'll give me that commendation ? I told you I would didn 't I ? - Same time next week ? - Always . You know you 're my favorite . I 've locked out bridge control . Transferred navigation , helm and long range communications to us . Seal off the armory . Secure as many decks as possible . Aye , Sir . Thank you , Mr. Scott . Broadcast this recording on all ship channels . Their phasers ... They 're only set to stun . Murder is the way of the empire . The way of the Captain . A way that must change . Join us , Mr. Chekov . Be apart of the future . Not of the past . Status report . The Andorian vessels have entered orbit , Sir . They 're charging weapons . Sound general quarters . Ready main phaser banks . They 're demanding we surrender , Captain . That was a warning shot across our bow . - Shields are holding . - Warning shot . Cowards . Lock onto their lead ship and fire . - Captain ? - I said fire . Aye , Sir . Weapons are locked out . Locked out from where ? Attention crew of the I.S.S. Enterprise this is first officer Spock . By now you are aware of the annihilation of the peaceful Halkan people . Lieutenant , kill that broadcast . This action has served only to hasten the fall of the terran empire . A civilization built upon a legacy of violence and terror . - Kill that broadcast . - I can 't , Sir . The time has come to embrace a new vision . A vision of equality . Of morality . Of galactic peace . A philosophy based upon infinite diversity in infinite combinations . This future is within our reach . But not under our present command . Join me . Together we shall be the architects of our own future . Captain 's log supplemental the Andorians are seeking vengeance for the Halkans . First officer Spock is a traitor to me and the empire . I will not lose the Enterprise . Our shields won 't hold forever , commander . Sir , she said she needed to speak with you . She poses no threat . Commander . We need to get to Captain Kirk 's quarters , quickly . Lieutenant Moreau it would be extremely unwise to ... Dammit , Mr. Spock . I can help . Just come with me , please . Mr. Scott . Encode a message to the Andorians . Inform them that we have control of the Enterprise . We are prepared to join their cause . I shall return momentarily . Or you won 't return at all . Lieutenant . Shut off that damn recording . Sir , the Andorians are powering down their weapons . I 'm detecting a transmission from auxiliary control , Captain . We 're suing for peace . The hell we are ... Where 's Mr. Leslie ? Mr. Leslie didn 't report for duty , Sir . Well get someone up here to cover his shift . I want a navigator . I want one now . So , this is it ? This is what I 've got to work with ? I can navigate the Enterprise , Sir . Whatever you want . Set a course for starbase 34 . Maximum warp . I 'm sorry , Captain . The controls aren 't responding . I tried . I can 't . You say you can pilot my ship . You can 't even get us out of orbit . Navigation has been rerouted to auxillary control . There 's is nothing I can do . Lieutenant . You 're relieved of your commission . Report to the brig . - Sir ? - Captain , it 's not her fault . I said report to the brig ! That 's enough . We found him unconscious on deck 8 , Sir . Chekov and the other men ... They 've turned . Resume the post . Am I not merciful ? Sulu . You 've got the conn . I want control of my ship . Or it 's the boot for the lot of you . What are you looking at ? You heard the Captain . Get to work . I was hoping you 'd come back during my shift . Oh . You happy to see me ? Always . The device of which the other Captain spoke , I presume . I am surprised Captain Kirk did not use it on me . Oh . He tried . Fascinating . James met an alien scientist . At the Starfleet penal colony on tantalus five . He pillaged her laboratory after he dispensed with her . Then he stole this device . One touch and your problems are over , Mr. Spock . This 'll change everything . You would see me use this device on him . I would . But you are the Captain 's woman . Yes . But not this Captain . No revolution can succeed using the same methods which failed in the previous one . Commander ... Spock ... Please find a way . ... a way to send me where he went . I cannot . Please . It is not within my power . But you can make a difference here . All clear , Sir . Wait outside . Captain Kirk to Mr. Spock . Captain Kirk to Mr. Spock . Captain Kirk to Mr. Spock . Spock here . Commander . There 's no reason we can 't talk about this like civilized men . I 've listened to your logic and I find it compelling . There 's merit in what you say , Spock . I see the potential for change . Opportunity to better the empire . Spock ... I have the bridge . You have auxiliary control . Who makes the next move ? What do you propose ? We meet ... Somewhere neutral ... Half an hour . Deck five . Officer 's lounge . No weapons . No tricks . Just you and I. We 've had many successes together , Spock . I know we can work this out . Very well . Half an hour . You don 't actually trust him , do you ? Of course not . It 's some kind of setup . Why play his game ? If there is any hope for the empire to change ... I must give Captain Kirk the opportunity to do so as well . Captain ... Commander ... No weapons . I 've considered our game while you were away . Bishop to queen 's level two . Knight takes bishop . You 've left your King vulnerable . As have you . Seems we 're at a stalemate . Spock ... You can 't win . What 's your next move ? Kill me , take command of the Enterprise ? There are a dozen starships out there . All loyal to the empire . As am I. But the empire as it stands today is at a crossroads . Eventually all kings are vulnerable . He put these thoughts into that vulcan head of yours , didn 't he ? That ... That other Captain . Spock ... After all we 've been through . All we 've accomplished . Earned for ourselves . You would trust a strange from another universe ? I believe I would . That Captain had a vision of an imminent future which you failed to see . Then you 're an even bigger fool than I imagined . Your mutiny ends . Right here and now . You didn 't really think I 'd let you walk out of here did you ? Now it comes to this . Checkmate . Perhaps not ... Mister Scott implemented a level three energy dampening field on this deck . Yet another act of treachery ... Which proves , once again ... Why your command must come to an end . Report ! The tectonic explosions are destabilizing the planet 's orbit . We 've run simulations of Dilithium generator strata in the chem lab . I 've seen this sort of thing before . The Andorian ships have broken orbit and gone to warp , Sir . They 've got the right idea , lad . Put some distance between us and that planet . There 's that human side . I always knew you 'd kill me to get the Captain 's chair . You 're no better than the rest of us . Captain Kirk . The future is coming . You are the past . I offer this crew an alternative . This crew ... This crew ? They don 't need alternatives . They 're pawns . Pawns need a King . They serve for my conquests . My victories . You think they 're smart enough to follow you ? They 're mine . I can use them . Break them . Send them to their own slaughter . And they 'll thank me for it . You double crossing half breed traitor . James T. Kirk . You are hereby relieved of command . Let go of me . Do you realize what you 're doing ? I do . You 're a coward , Spock . You don 't even have the guts to execute us like a real leader . This shuttlecraft is at your disposal . I recommend setting a course to the nearest habitable system . You have sufficient supplies to last until then . You think that changes anything ? So you 've taken control of one ship . So what ? What now ? Peace ? Freedom ? The empire will hunt you down like the mangy dog that you are . Perhaps ... But I must try ... You won 't get away with this , Spock . You 're just one man . In every revolution there is one man with a vision ... Who told you that ? You did . Spock ! Commander . Status report . All decks reporting in , Captain . The Halkan survivors are safely on board . Shuttlecraft Galileo is leaving sensor range . James T. Kirk chose his path . It is time we chose ours . Warp two , ensign . Heading , Sir ? Forward .

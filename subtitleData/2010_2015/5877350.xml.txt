 Previously on " the 100 " ... You 're being sent to the ground . Before the last war , mount weather was A military base built within a mountain . No one ever made it there . Dante : Welcome to mount weather . You 're not prisoners . We saved you . Why would we want to leave ? We have friends out there who need our help . Clarke , no ! If you pull that lever , these people will die . Even a little radiation could kill them . Are we really gonna do this , Bring the ark to the ground ? Tell me what it 's like . Everything i dreamed . Thelonious , you should be here . My job is done . Jaha out . [ baby cries ] I thought you died . You brought me to your village ? They 'll kill you . You son of a bitch ! Unh ! You are not in control here anymore . [ indistinct chatter ] [ tool whirring ] Open it up . Yes , sir . How long are you gonna keep me Locked up in here ? Until i 'm confident you 're no longer A threat to others . Let 's continue . Now you said there were hundreds Of grounders attacking . 200 , 300 ? I didn 't count . Why do you think they attacked ? What provoked them ? We were here . That was enough . We 're wasting time . The others didn 't just vanish into thin air . They were taken , and we need to go after them . Search team is prepping to leave But not before we 've gotten the intel we need from you . I need to be on that team , please . That 's out of the question . You 're not trained . It 's too dangerous . Those are my people out there . They 're my people , too . You want to help them ? Tell me what we 're up against- - Grounder tactics , their numbers , What kind of weapons they used . Arrows and spears , axes , swords , Their teeth . No guns ? You had guns . The guns we found at the aid depot Leveled the playing field , And maybe , maybe if we 'd had more bullets , we could have- - There were more bullets . Search team just returned from the bunker .

That could have been the kids . Abby ! No . We 'll sweep the woods . In the meantime , who issued you that weapon ? I did , sir . From now on , Only members of the guard get guns . Unauthorized use of firearms Will be punishable as a felony Under the exodus charter . Is that clear ? Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Marcus , search the damn woods . Move out ! Teams of 3 ! Yes , ma 'am ! Radio checks at 5-minute intervals . Let 's go ! [ music playing ] It 's not bad . Maybe they 'll hang it on the walls here one day . Boy : Miller ! Look who finally got released . Hey . Miller .

I have to go to quarantine . Hey , clarke . What are you doing ? Maybe they found survivors . If our people are hurt , we have a right to know . I 'm pretty sure we shouldn 't just go W-wandering around . Maya : What are we dealing with ? They were attacked . One dead . He 's in room two . The other took off his gloves and mask to treat him . He 's still in decon , but he 'll need treatment As soon as he 's processed through . Who attacked them ? What are they doing here ? Hey , stop ! It 's not safe ! It is for us . Let 's go , jasper . Someone 's got to keep her out of trouble . Clarke , slow down ! Stop pushing so hard . These people are- - Are lying to us . That 's a bullet wound . Grounders don 't use guns . Unless the grounders got the guns from us . I don 't think so . I think our people are alive out there . Get them out of here . [ music playing ] [ baby crying ] [ crying continues ] [ crying continues ] How are you feeling ? Awesome . She 's lying . I know that face . Just spit it out , abby . The bullet is still shifting . That 's why you 're in pain . I was hoping that it would stabilize by now . So how about you take it out ? Raven , we need to talk about that . The bullet is pressing on your spine . If we leave it in , you 'll live , But you 'll never walk again . And take it out ? The surgery could kill you . We have no equipment , we have no anesthesia . Will i walk again ? Maybe , but you 'd be awake the whole time . You 'd feel everything . Sign me up . Wait . Raven , you could die . In zero g i didn 't need my legs . Down here , i do . Take it out . Where 's lincoln ? Drink . Drink or die . Your choice . All of it . We need to talk . Sure . Let 's talk over breakfast . Who shot that solider ? The patrol that was looking for your people Was attacked by what you call grounders . I fought grounders . They don 't use guns . I never mentioned guns . Sergeant shaw as shot by an arrow . That 's not true . I-i saw the wound . Sometimes , we feel so strongly about our people We see things that aren 't there . I 'd like to see the body . Of course . Come with me . [ baby crying ] I know the air 's not that great , But that 's all we got left . We 're in a fine mess now , aren 't we ? But i can 't let you die up here with me . Yes . I guess we better find a way to get you to the ground , huh ? Yeah . You like that idea ? [ cooing ] Ooh . Ok . Ok . Come on . Ok now , ok . Let 's see what we have left up here that can save us . We 're almost ready . Do you want me to talk Or just shut up ? Stop ! I 'm so scared . Look at me . Ok ? Just keep looking at me . She 's ready . Aah ! [ raven screaming ] Yeah . That was me at the grounder camp . You now , i did everything i could not scream , but eventually- - But eventually , you broke And you told them everything . And you wouldn 't have because you 're better than me . Damn right . I 'm not a traitor . I didn 't tell them where they could find us . And i did . Yeah , i did . After they tortured me in their prison camp for 3 days , But go ahead . You just keep believing , Even if you are in here just like me . [ raven screaming and sobbing ] All right . Bring it in .

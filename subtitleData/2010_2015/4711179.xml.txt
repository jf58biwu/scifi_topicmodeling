 BELL RINGS MAN : Next up , an experiment to measure peer pressure . How much is the individual influenced by the group ? Seeing as Arnold Rimmer 's late , the subject of this experiment can be him . When he finally does us the honour of turning up , I shall ask you a set of questions and want you to answer accordingly . First day of term and I 'm late ! So embarrassing . He 'll kill me . Ahh ! Mr Rimmer ! I hope we haven 't inconvenienced you too much by starting on time . Sorry , Father . I 'm " Father " outside college . Inside college , I 'm " sir " or " Lecturer Rimmer " , understand ? Yes , Father . I mean , sir . So embarrassing . We 're just about to run through a few questions as part of psy profiling . OK , take a look at this colour . Is it purple , blue or green ? Hands up , purple . Hands up , blue . Green . A fallopian tube is a musical instrument . True or false ? True ? What 's the answer to this piece of arithmetic ? ALARM BLARES SNORES WEAPON COCKS You kills my brother . Hm ? Oh , you got the wrong quarters , bud . You want Lister . That 's two floors down , second on the right , fourth on the left . Night ! You kills my brother . One floor down , sir . Elevator at the end of the hallway . You kills my brother . Oh , smeg off , Rimmer . I 'm tryin ' to sleep , man . WEAPON FIRES COUGHS You kills my brother . No , I didn 't . Oh , yes , you did ! No , I smeggin ' didn 't ! I are here to challenge theys who kills my brother to a duel to the ungonising death . I will give you five of your Earth minutes and then ... I will pursue you across space unto the end of time itself . I will not rest until you are choking ' on your own warm blood . Sounds fair to me . Butt out , Rimmer . Don 't encourage him . Do you accept the challenge , humo , a duel across time and space ? No ! Why ? Hogey , you are always doing this - picking fights and then challenging us to duels across time and space . No , I not . Yes , you are . No , I not . Yes , you smeggin ' are ! You rogue droids are obsessed with duels across time and space . You eesult my kind , saying we are obsessed with duels across time and space . I therefore challenge you to a duel across time and space . I will give you five of your ... No duels across time and space . Why ? ! Look , at first , it was fun , it distracted us from being stuck in deep space , no ... way of getting back home . But we 're all duelled out - our duelling days are over . Duellos annonos . Oh , please ! No ! I will give you a leetle start . No ! But we are in deep space . It 's light years from anywhere . There be nothing else to do . You think I don 't know that ? So , how we going to keep from going crazy ? For you , my friend , it 's way too late . How about a ping-pong marathon ? Get a few buddies together . Rogue nutters versus the Dwarfers . We already do that . You guys , you always win . Crazy golf , then , the botanical gardens . We 'll give you a shot a hole . Oh , yeah , like we stand a chance . What 's wrong with that ? ! You be knowing all the burrows , how to get in and out the little windmills . What else ? All right , tell you what . A cooking contest . Who can bake the most delicious cake - we 'll thrash you . Not if it a choux pastry , you won 't . Ooh , choux pastry . Big words , my demented friend . What are we playing for ? If I win ... LISTER : Oh ... BOTH : .. a duel across time and space . But if you win , a great treasure , the likes of which you have never seen . A piece of old cloth ? ! No , thanks , we 've already got one . Hey , it 's a map . A map the likes of which you have never seen . Everything 's the likes of which you 've never seen with him . Do you doubt me ? I 'm just sayin ' , you 'd be surprised the likes of which we have seen . Don 't be so quick to say everything 's the likes of which we haven 't seen . We 've seen things the likes of which you probably haven 't seen yourself . Is that a challenge ? BOTH : No duels ! The map , it show everything in this galaxy - every wormhole , every derelict , every planet . Where d 'you get this ? I steal from a Simulant Death Ship . Hm , you don 't want to mess with those guys . They 're deranged . Once you cross them , they hunt you down . Not me . I steal while they slumber . I clever as a hedgehog . Look out ! ALARM BLARES AIR WHOOSHES The hull 's cracked ! Sorry to intrude , sir . Is now a good time to clean your quarters ? Certainly looks like it could do with a good tidy . Oh ! Sorry , sir , I didn 't realise you had company . I 'll rework my schedule . Sorry to intrude again , sir . When is a good time for my lesson on human modes of speech ? Oh , now 's an excellent time , Kryten . Come in , take a seat . Oh , what fun , sir ! That 's sarcasm , right ? You see ? I am getting the hang of it ! There 's a ship outside ! They 're attacking us ! He 's sealed the crack . We 've got to get out of here . We can 't just leave him ! Watch me . What 's that ? Oh , nothing . Look , I 'll be back . I don 't know how , I don 't know when . You abandon me ? Then I have no choice . I challenge you to a duel ... Oh , what 's the point ? ALARM BLARES What the hell 's going on ? Who 's doing this ? Kryten , scan the local vicinity for any anomalous energy patterns . Everything 's down , sir . We 're on EPS . Trying to reboot . So , let me get this right . We 're being attacked by somethin but we don 't know what , and there 's no way of finding out what 's out there ? I have a suggestion , sirs . What ? How about we look out of the window ? Sometimes the old ways are the best ways . Do it . What , me , sir ? On my own ? Of course on your own . I love solo missions ! I 'm on my way , sir . RUMBLING Would you like a written report , sir , or under these circumstances , would a verbal account suffice ? Get on with it , man ! What 's out there ? A rogue Simulant Death Ship , sir . A Death Ship ? Yes , sir . Should we be concerned ? Concern would be an entirely appropriate response under these circumstances , sir . What d 'you think they want ? Although the Death Ship didn 't indicate the exact nature of their business , sir , I 'm guessing it 's something a bit ... deathy . They must have been tracking Hogey . Finding us is just a bonus . Simulants ! These are the guys who despise humans , right ? The ones who won 't rest till they 've annihilated every single one . Correct , sir . Not me , then . Excellent ! I 'll be in the rec room , reading this month 's copy of I 'm OK ! Magazine . Make no mistake , sir - they will see us all as Mr Lister 's lieutenants . They will show us no mercy . Death Ships are captained by special berserker generals who 've been crossbred to create an insane biomechanical entity ... of pure evil . My Dominator , forgive me , I implore you . The Earth one remains alive . Forgiveness is a human quality , Chancellor . It has no meaning to a Simulant general . You know what you must do . GULPS GROANS Ooh . Nuhh . GROANS Uhh ! Ohh ! Uh . Firstly ... polish my Sword of Spite as a punishment for your idiocy ... Polish ? Yes . Polish . As a punishment for your idiocy . Secondly ... Just polish ? Yes , just polish ! Secondly ... write me a formal letter of apology . So , you just want me to polish your sword and write a letter ? Yes . Nothing else ? Nothing else . So , you don 't want me to , er ... ooh , I don 't know , er , commit hari-kari or anything ? Of course not ! SQUELCHING DRIPPING Well , sir , that wasn 't made very clear . Er , when you slid the sword across the table , I naturally assumed you wanted me to commit hari-kari . No , I do not ! Oh , I know that now , sir . Before , though , it was just ... you know , it was a bit ambiguous . Er ... I think a new system is in order . I 'm going to go now , sir . Er ... My Dominator , thank you . Ooh . Uhh . Oh , Chancellor . You do have a tendency to jump to conclusions . Let this be a little lesson to you . Oh . That bit looks important . CHUCKLES DARKLY Hang on , hang on . Do you know how to work that ? It 's got lots of different settings , but yeah . Thought not . What the hell just happened ? What the hell is this thing ? It 's a wibbly gun . It makes things go all ... .. wibblified . It appears to destabilise the molecular structure of solid objects , sir . His version was clearer . Come on . Cargo bay . Let 's get to Blue Midget and CB3 . BEEPING Rimmer , what is that ? It 's a holo-lamp , isn 't it , sir ? It plays holo-messages . My father gave it to me when I was a boy . He told me to play it the day I become an officer and join the Space Corps , the day I become a somebody . So , never been played , right ? And it shan 't be until I 'm an officer . Come on , let 's go ! Death Ship and three Annihilators at six o 'clock , sirs . Question . Can we stay ahead of them ? Only if we have enough fuel , sir . Two , maybe three hours . Asteroid field 80 clicks west . Maybe offer some cover . I 'm taking her in . According to the readouts , quadrant two , vector four . We can hide in that asteroid . Take us in ! My Dominator , I am afraid the human insurgents have escaped . Er , they 've flown into an asteroid field . That is totally unacceptable ! I agree , My Dominator . The security forces have been shambolic . Those responsible should be agonised . I-I agree also . And I. And I. And I. And I also . Oh , I refuse to be surrounded by these toadying sycophants ! I agree , My Dominator . I agree also . And I. And I. And I. And I also . I want each member of my council to think for themselves , not just agree with my every word and whim out of some pathetic boot-trembling terror for self-preservation . Question my judgements ! Debate me , yeah ? Only then will we be truly strong . Dominator , that simply isn 't true . I mean , the last person to contradict you was ... Kill him . What ? ! Do you see what I mean ? Now , find the ship ! Ow ... It appears they 've surrounded the asteroid belt and are sending in probes to locate our position . It 's only a matter of time before they find us . So , what 's our next move ? Shall I go slip into something more appropriate , like , say , a coffin ? Is that it ? We 're all going to die ? Well , YOU 'RE all going to die . I 'm already dead . I had the sense to get dying out of the way early . For years , you mocked me . Not laughing now , are you ? Oh , yeah , cos being dead is such an advantage here ( ! ) It is an advantage . How 's it an advantage ? I was killed instantly , Lister - painless , quick and stylish . " What 's that coming down the corridor ? " Ooh , it looks like a radiation leak . " Wham , dead . Not perfect , I 'll grant you , but at least it wasn 't embarrassing . Embarrassing ? No weeping , getting hysterical . Not one of those deaths where you lose control of your bodily functions , your bowels clearing all over the place . At least my death was dignified . I 'd hardly call yelling , " Mummy , Mummy , " dignified . Lister , I didn 't yell , " Mummy , Mummy . " No , you didn 't have the time . You just yelled , " Mu ... " Please , sirs , this is very bad for morale . I can 't believe you 're arguing about who 's going to have the best death ! I 'm only trying to help , give you some advice on how to die nicely . You want to die twice , keep talking . Please , sir ! He 's right . We 're all getting crazy . We need to chill . You 're right . We 've been in these situations before , we always find a way out . Like the time that highly corrosive micro-organism almost destroyed Red Dwarf . The highly corrosive micro-organism , exactly ! We got out of that one . Yeah , thanks to me . Oh , sir ! You cannot claim the credit for that . It was a total fluke . Fluke ? You think that was an accident , the way I ... ? Ssh ! What 's that ? Something 's coming into the asteroid . It 's a probe . It 's approaching half a click east . Switch out all the lights . Good thinking ! They 'll think we 're all out . If things get really tricky , we 'll get Kryten to open the airlock and tell ' em we 've moved . It seems to be backing off , sir . They 're coming back . Look , we 've got to get a battleplan - astro-nav space-school stuff . Rimmer , is that something you could handle ? Pardon ? Is that something you can handle ? ! The responsibility of coming up with a battle plan ? All that strategy stuff . Why me ? Cos you 're into military strategy ! If it was a curry-eating competition to the death , it 'd be me . If it was a towel-folding competition to the death ... That would be me ! Phuw , phuw , phuw-phuw-phuw-phuw . Phuw-phuw-phuw . Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh . I 'd win that one , sir . And what kind of competition to the death would it have to be before you chose me ? So , moving on ... Er ... Can you do it ? Yes , of course I can do it . Obviously . You don 't sound very confident . I 'm very confident . I 've waited my whole life for this moment . Command of my own ship in a battle against overwhelming odds ? It 's your moment of destiny . Right . I 'll just ... make my way into the ... supply room and think of a plan , then . It 'll be just like taking an exam . I can do this . Sir , surely there must be an alternative . If there was , Kryten , we 'd be doing it . ALL : We 're smegged . Any joy , sir ? Not yet , no . I 'm still at the " can 't think of a plan " stage . Well , I don 't know if this will help , sir , but I 've done a ship-wide search and collated all the weapons we have on board ship , sir . Good , Kryten . I was just about to suggest that myself . Two forks and a pencil sharpener ? ! Now , there is a rumour that there 's a stick and some string , sir . But I don 't want to raise false hopes . There is , of course , Hogey 's molly D. The molecular destabiliser . Mm . I 'll leave it with you , sir . Ehh ! They 're driving me crazy , cooped up in there . Thought I 'd take a break and come in here ! Oww ! I love the string game ! Have you thought of your plan yet ? You can 't think of anything , can you ? I just love the string game ! You know why ? Because you 're an idiotic cat ? No . Why you can 't think of a plan , dummy ? Because you 're driving me crazy , that 's why . Uh-uh . There 's a demon messing up your head . Yes , you ! No . Your father . My father 's dead . No way , non-bud . His worthless , skinny ass lives on inside you , freezing your soul with fear . How do you know all this ? Do you think awesome good looks and rock-hard pecs are my only qualities ? I 'm a cat . I sense things . You gotta nail that demon and kick his sorry ass outta town . How ? The only thing keeping him alive is you . You 're never going to win over that dude 's approval . Give it up ! Let it go . Hey ! Look how it 's moving ! I lo-ove the string game ! Stop moving ! Anythin ' ? Nothing . What you doing ? I 'm going to play this . Your father 's message ? But why , sir ? If I play it before I 've become the person he wanted me to become , it means I don 't care what he thinks any more . It means ... I 'm free of him . Arnold , it 's me . If you 're playing this message , it means you 're an officer in the Space Corps . You 've achieved your dreams , you 're a man of significance and substance , so this won 't matter to you now . Arnold , I 'm not your father . But that 's impossible . It 's not true ! Look inside yourself and you will know I speak the truth . Your father wasn 't me . It was Dungo , our gardener . But he was a babbling imbecile ! A billion-piece jigsaw suddenly falls into beautiful place . Know from now on your family line isn 't made up of Austrian princes and French royalty , but of lame-brained artisans and pram-faced trollops . I didn 't tell you before because I didn 't want it to affect your self-esteem . But now you 've achieved all your dreams , it doesn 't matter a jot . Goodbye , Arnold . And good luck . PS - naturally , I won 't be sending you any more birthday presents . This is the worst thing that can happen . Mr Rimmer 's always had a huge ego and no self-confidence . Now his ego 's smaller than a pixie 's right nut after an icy bath . Well , you know , he thought he came from a military family , high-flyers , success ingrained in the very core of their DNA . Now he discovers he 's no better than me . What a nightmare . RIMMER SIGHS I think I 've got something . What ? How ? I 've been thinking . If Dungo ... I mean Dennis ... I mean Dad ... were here now , he 'd be so proud . Second Technician in the JMC , senior officer in a mining ship , and I don 't smell of manure . Suddenly , I don 't have that voice in my head telling me I 'm useless at everything . I have a new voice telling me how proud he is . I can think , and I think I 've got a plan . It 's crap ! I have to admit , sir , I 'm not entirely convinced myself . I thought it was quite clever . Let 's take a vote . Who 's against ? 'Take a look at this colour . 'Is it purple , blue or green ? 'Fallopian tube is a musical instrument . True or false ? 'True ? ' It 'll work ! Jujitsu-style ! Use the might of your opponent against himself ! Are you quite sure , sir ? We have nothing to fear but fear itself . Apart from pain . And maybe humiliation . And obviously death and failure . But apart from fear , pain , humiliation , failure , the unknown and death , we have nothing to fear but fear itself . Who 's with me ? I know I need to work harder on that fear speech , it wasn 't quite as rousing as it should be , but ... we can do this . He 's right ! Let 's do it . Let 's do it ! Come on ! Come on ! Get your butts in the air and let 's go ! Yeah ! Kryten , bring them forks - we might need them . There , My Dominator . They 're emerging from the meteor . Mm . How 's it looking ? Is it all going to plan ? Nothing in sight , sir . Oh . We 're surrounded . Twelve o 'clock , nine o 'clock , six o 'clock , three o 'clock . The Death Ship and three Annihilators . Keep them in line - it 's absolutely crucial . Right , open comm channels . Here goes . Open , sir . This is Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer of the mining ship Red Dwarf . Under Treaty 5 of the Geneva Convention , we claim the freedoms and privileges of prisoners of war . Ha ! Load the photon mutilators . Mm . Perhaps you didn 't hear me . We 're surrendering . Mutilators loaded , Your Excellency . You can 't open fire on a surrendering ship . That 's a scandalous breach of the niceties of battle . All ships , prepare to fire , on my orders . Right ! You 're on report , m 'laddo . Fire ! Blow us up all you like , but don 't think for one second you 're getting away with it . A letter worded in the strongest possible language is going off to Geneva . Now , I 'm not going to ask you again . Abort your attack . Right , that 's it . " Dear sir ... " I was scandalised earlier today by a Simulant Death Ship " which contravened Treaty 5 of the Geneva Convention . " Impact - 16 seconds . It 's the way of all things . You live , you die . But sometimes you live , you die , and then you live again . I know . I 've done it myself . Now ! They 've destabilised their whole ship , all four bulkheads . LISTER : Look out ! Our own torpedoes are on a collision course , Sire . Under Treaty 5 of the Geneva Convention , we claim the freedoms and privileges of prisoners of war ! Sorry , I missed that . Pardon ? CHEERING Good job , sirs . Hell of a job . You know what this makes me ? A working-class hero . Working-class hero , you and me both . Kryten ... set a course for Red Dwarf . The slime 's coming home . ♪ It 's cold outside There 's no kind of atmosphere ♪ I 'm all alone , more or less ♪ Let me fly far away from here ♪ Fun , fun , fun ♪ In the sun , sun , sun ♪ I want to lie Shipwrecked and comatose ♪ Drinking fresh mango juice ♪ Goldfish shoals nibbling on my toes ♪ Fun , fun , fun ♪ In the sun , sun , sun ♪ Fun , fun , fun ♪ In the sun , sun , sun . ♪ What did I tell ya ?

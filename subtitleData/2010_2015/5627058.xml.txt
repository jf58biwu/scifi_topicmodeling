 Narrator : Previously on Helix ... What 's your name ? Jaye . I did this . I 've been here before . Julia : Oh , my god . Just shut up and go right now ! Alan : They 'll kill you , but they won 't kill me . You stole me from my parents . Daniel . My name is Miksa . How long have you known about your tumor ? Sarah : The vectors , they took Peter up into the ducts . [ vector shrieking ] Look at you . Your symptoms are gone . I 'm cured . How ? I don 't know . Dr. Walker is no longer your concern . She 's now the property of the Ilaria corporation . You can 't just appropriate a human being . Oh , but I can . Ahhh ! [ footsteps ] [ clattering ] [ clanging ] [ silence ] [ clattering ] [ clanking ] [ vector shrieking ] [ shrieking continues ] [ clanging ] [ stun baton zapping ] [ panting ] You okay ? That was a close one . Yeah , but it worked . [ sighs ] The good news is , we only needed one of them . Let 's get him to the cryo lab for testing . Next time , you can be the bait . Alan : One vector . One vector . We 've hardly seen any since Peter was taken . Where 'd they all go ? I must insist you return upstairs . This exercise is too dangerous . On the contrary , level r seems ... Almost abandoned . Any idea how 50 vectors just ... Disappear ? [ sighs ] Alan : He came from in here , right ? Sarah : Yeah . And we 're on the bottom level of the base ? Yes . Then why is there air coming up from below ? This isn 't the bottom level , is it ? What 's down there ? Tell them everything . Or I will . Tell me what ? Level x . Level x . There 's a ... What is on Level X ? The virus vault . Daniel : That 's where we keep all our original core samples . You have original samples of Narvik ? A and b strains ? Of course he does . He created them . Come with me . You engineered ... An apocalypse virus ? Hatake : I was never going to deliver it . That doesn 't matter ! Hatake : Ilaria wanted a virus and a cure . I used them to create something more beneficial . Like creating smallpox to cure cancer ? If I didn 't , They would have hired another lab , One that might have given them the virus . Without me , you 'd be dealing with a billion bodies by now . No , you don 't get to play the hero . What you 've done is unconscionable . [ scoffs ] Sutton was a much greater evil . Sarah : Was ? What happened to her exactly ? She is ... No longer a problem . What 's coming next is far worse than Sutton . What do you mean ? Sutton was just a messenger . Next , They will send an army . They will not stop Until they have the virus . [ theme music playing ] Then we need to get down there And destroy the virus Before Ilaria get their hands on it . Show them . Daniel : Just give me a second to pull up the image . Sarah : Sure , where is it ? You have a lot of explaining to do . I 'm sorry . I was trying to protect you . You god damn drugged me ! Tell me about the picture . The one of us . I couldn 't have been more than six years old . We have met before . When you were a child . Then you knew my mother ? Of course . She was extremely talented . A topnotch cellular biologist . And yet you asked me about her Just a few days ago , pretending you 'd never heard of her . Your mother was one of the finest scientists I ever met . A great mentor . She was also ... A dear friend . I visited her several times in Montana . That 's when that photo was taken . How is that photo even possible ? It was 30 years ago . You look ex ... I was a very young man . So it 's just a coincidence that I 'm here At your base , all these years later ? Coincidence , karma , fate Call it what you wish . [ sighs ] [ door buzzes ] [ door opening ] [ door closes ] [ buzzer sounds ] You still here ? Klein : Why didn 't the old lady let you go ? Seems she had different plans . Too bad she won 't be here to see the shitstorm crash down on this place . Klein : In two days , Ilaria 's gonna drop in , full force . Yeah ? Hope we 're here to see it . Klein : Shouldn 't be a problem . Aren 't you supposed to be some kind of Houdini with locks ? Most locks . But they added an electromagnetic seal after I got out last time . Meaning what ? I can get the door unlocked , But I can 't get it to move , genius . Daniel : Level x was here long before we were . It 'll be here long after we 're gone . Sarah : What was it ? The remains of an abandoned Russian trading post from the 1850 's . [ beeping ] Daniel : I 'll pull up the security cameras . Sarah : Oh , my god . Alan : At least now we know where all the vectors went . Hatake : They are attracted to heat . The vault has its own power supply . Is the vault secure ? Solid as a rock . So , how do we get down there To destroy what 's left of the Narvik samples ? There is a secure staircase . I will go down . Like hell you will . Alan : I don 't trust you anywhere near that virus . And how do you plan to get past the vectors ? We already know the halothane gas doesn 't work on them . I don 't know ... Yet . Guys , take a look at this . Daniel : What are they doing ? Sarah : It 's swarm behavior , Like bees in a hive , they 're all drawn to something . Or someone . [ vectors growling ] [ Peter coughing ] [ Peter roaring ] [ shrieking ] [ panting ] [ banging against window ] [ vector roaring ] I don 't know what you 're trying to accomplish . We got better results with the RACAL suits . You have RACAL suits for every vector on this base ? Yeah , good point . Ready for the cold stuff ? Yeah . [ gas hissing ] [ victor chuckles ] Victor : Look at that . CFC gas puts ' em in a state of paralysis . That ought to do the trick for the vectors downstairs . Yeah , there 's just one problem . I don 't have enough gas to hit the whole floor . I won 't be needing the gas . Well , how are you gonna get the temperature down ? You gotta hit at least , what , minus 40 to see any results ? It 's minus 50 outside . [ laughs ] Sure . So , what , they 're gonna follow you right out ? Hey , that 'd be a hell of a snowball fight . I 'm bringing the outside to them . Balleseros : Why don 't you just bang your head against it ? Probably just as effective . Better that than getting murdered . I don 't think Hatake works that way . Hmm . He 's hyper efficient . Killing us causes more problems than it solves ... At least for now . Then we have a chance , if we can hold out Until Ilaria blows the hell out of this place . They don 't know we 're down here . If they blow up the base , we 're locked inside . We gotta let them know , man . Maybe we can ... Light a signal fire or something . You keep thinking , Klein , 'cause that 's what you 're good at . Hey , I just want to be standing at the end of this . Not like Sutton or that Inuit bitch . What about the Inuit girl ? Sutton sent a squad down to kill her And burn her whole village to the ground . No loose ends . Alan : We 'll have no way of communicating Between the mechanical room and Level X The walls are too thick so everything will have to be perfectly timed . Daniel will prep the base While Hatake and Jordan take the power grid offline . Then Julia and I will make the descent to Level X to destroy the core virus . I should go with you and Julia . You can 't . I need you to keep an eye on Hatake . It 's just flipping switches . I don 't trust him with Julia . Alan , let me go down there alone . Are you crazy ? There were two vectors in the ducts And they didn 't attack me . Peter didn 't attack me either . We still don 't know why they do ... Alan : Or don 't do anything . [ whispering ] shit . You all right over there ? Uh , yeah . My zipper 's just caught . [ door closing ] Take this . Just in case . She won 't need it , you will . Alan : Step one . Hatake and Jordan familiarize themselves with the power grid . Alan : Make sure the boilers and the forced air system Are turned off in sequence . One . Two . Three . This is three . That 's four . Sorry . Three , four . Then ... Alan : It has to be perfectly timed . If the power 's still on when Julia and I get to Level X , Then the vectors will still be active , and we don 't want that . Alan : Step two . Daniel and his security team Will distribute thermal blankets to as many uninfected as possible . Now , it 's 28 minutes maximum . That should be survivable , but after that hypothermia will start to set in And we 'll start losing people . A survival blanket . Ha ! Ha ! You want to feel real cold ? You should try working here for a while . Oh , what , no takers ? How about a paycheck ? Haven 't had one of those in a while . Alan : Step three . Julia and I will descend Hatake 's private staircase At exactly 0200 . Mark . System voice : Access granted . Alan : And at the same time , you and Sarah turn off the power grid . We flood the base with all that outside air And freeze the vectors in place . Hatake : Now . Now ! Okay . One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! [ beeping ] [ clanking ] Alan : When the blowers stop , the pressure will change , And then the hot air will rise up and out As the cold air sinks down to the bottom of the base . [ labored breathing ] Hiroshi , I 'm gonna die soon . And nothing I did will ever matter . I ... I accomplished nothing . Sarah : I left nothing behind . It will be like I never even existed . Hatake : Dr. Jordan ? Can you hear me ? And I worked so hard , but it doesn 't matter . Can you hear me ? [ footsteps ] Julia : How do you think we 'll know if your plan worked ? If we 're not ... Attacked and infected when we get to this Level X , Then it worked . System voice : Emergency power active . Emergency power active . What the hell , man ? Are they here already ? No . It 's too soon . What do you think it is ? Opportunity . I thought you said you couldn 't break the electromagnetic thingy . Not with the power on , Einstein . Alan : We 'll have 28 minutes tops to destroy the core virus And get back upstairs before the heat comes on . Julia : Cold . It 'll get worse . Keep moving . Alan , if this doesn 't work ... If this doesn 't work , We burn the base to the ground with everyone in it . Everyone ? Even Peter ? Even Peter . But if we destroy the base , how do we get home ? We don 't . [ clattering ] Jesus . Eighteen minutes . Keep moving . [ vectors breathing quietly ] System voice : Access granted . Oh , my god . There are too many . Alan : Ebola Zaire . Ebola Reston . Rift valley fever . What the ... Marburg , Lassa ... Spanish flu . They 've got more strains here than we do at the CDC . Wait . Don 't put them back . Jules , we don 't have time . We have to find the Narvik . We have 11 minutes , all right ? That 's less time than we need . You want to leave all these for Ilaria ? [ incinerator roaring ] [ warning alarm blaring ] We should go upstairs , hunker down and wait for reinforcements . I 'll take my chances outside . It 's suicide out there . I have to . I 'm not leaving the base . No , you 're not . [ Klein groans ] Have you ever seen death ? Ever stared it right in the face ? [ Hatake breathing heavily ] Sarah : Do you know what that 's like ? No . I thought it would be a dark and empty hole . But it 's not . It as bright as day and it 's filled with All the things you never did in your life . Dr. Jordan . We are almost at the hypothermic limit . Please ! It 's almost time ! I 'll never cure the incurable . I 'll never crack an RNA code , I 'll never win the Seaborg . [ sobbing ] and I 'll never have children . [ beeping ] [ Sarah hyperventilating ] Hatake : Doctor ! Dr. Jordan ? Son of a bitch . Alan : Yersinia pestis . This is the black death . Plague of Justinian . Cocoliztli . Sweating sickness . It 's like a who 's who of mass epidemics in here . Narvik . It 's gone . Someone got here before us . Maybe it was misplaced . [ watch beeping ] We 're out of time . No , no , no , no , not yet . Jules , we don 't have time . Julia : Wait , wait . Alan : Jules . Julia : Okay . No , no , no , no , no , we don 't have time . They 're waking up ! [ snowmobile sputtering ] Balleseros : Aw , shit ! [ groans ] If you shoot me , you kill your sister and your brother . [ panting ] Tell me . Sutton sent a squad to track down Anana and burn the village . Bullshit . We rounded up all her men . Apparently not . It 's the truth . Believe me . Why do you care ? Because at some point , it just has to stop . Now , you can shoot me , But I 'm still going . No , you 're not . We 're going . [ engine starting ] [ vectors growling ] [ groans ] Keep going , don 't stop . Don 't worry about me . [ growling continues ] [ pounding on door ] Julia : Wait . Come on ! Alan , those are my initials . Alan : We don 't have time ! Alan , those are my initials . I did that . How ? I don 't know , but I 'm here for a reason . And I have to go down there . Are you sure about this ? I was a little girl , maybe six or seven , But my mother brought me to this place . She knew Hatake . Why didn 't you ever tell me ? I thought I was just hallucinating from the virus , But it was like a repressed memory , Something I didn 't want to know until now . Jules , that door will not hold forever . If we go down there , we may not come back up . I 'm not asking you to come with me . I 'm not asking your permission . [ pounding continues ] [ Julia panting ] This is it . This is why I 'm here . You 're sure ? [ light switch clicking ] Oh , my god . Jules , what is this place ? Where are we ? Home . What 's wrong ? The trail 's gone . Balleseros : I thought you people were supposed to be Good at this tracking shit . Our people can 't track anything Through the blowing snow in the middle of the night . Our people are also really good at not being followed . Anana . You two make more noise than a rutting caribou . Anana : My snowmobile threw a track . I saw your lights about two miles back . Thought you were part of those Ilaria assholes . That 's why we 're here . Sutton sent a death squad after you . A group came by here about three hours ago . Daniel : How many ? Three snowmobiles , five riders . Are they on their way to the village ? As far as we know , with orders to terminate . We need to go now ! You told me you spent summers in Montana . I did . Apparently also here . But why would Hatake build an exact replica Of my mother 's cabin ? Seems like something you 'd have told me by the third date . It looks exactly the same . How ? The question is , why ? Why bring a six year old girl here ? Why build a fake cabin to make her think it was home ? I don 't know . Well , what do you remember about your mother ? Hardly anything . She died when I was young . Well , think , Jules . There must be something . Peter said something to me . Peter spoke to you ? When I was hallucinating , he said , " it 's about you , Julia . It 's always been about you . " Might have been your subconscious talking . Or it might be the reason we 're all here . We have to go . [ binoculars scanning ] About 15 civilians being loaded into a trailer . Why would they do that ? My guess is they 're gonna set it on fire . Less to clean up that way . Easy ! No , I am not gonna let them burn to death ! Neither am I. We just can 't go strolling in there . You gotta think like a soldier . Daniel : He 's right . We 're outnumbered and outgunned . Can you get us close ? Oh , yeah . Soldier 1 : Come on , keep moving . Soldier2 : Get going ! Go on ! Go on ! Let 's go ! Get in ! Balleseros : Hey , you missed one ! Caught her out around the perimeter about to snipe your ass . We checked the perimeter . We didn 't see anyone . Sir . Soldier : We didn 't see anyone , sir . Miksa ? Hey , that 's one of them ! He works for me . [ chuckles ] [ Anana speaking other language ] I 'm with him . I don 't know any stupid Eskimos . [ Tulok spits ] [ breathing heavily ] Alan , I 'm sorry I never told you . Alan 's not here . But ... You 're going to be okay . The surgery didn 't work . It was too close to the spinal cord . Grade iv metastatic . Alan : As soon as we get back to Hatake 's office , I 'm gonna find out ... [ door creaking ] [ vectors growling ] Stay back , Peter . [ growling continues ] Jules ... Get right behind me . Stay close . What are you doing ? Trust me on this , Alan . Go upstairs . Go . Jules , come . I 'll hold them back . [ shrieking ] [ gun clicks ] Soldier : Go ahead , finish him . Balleseros : Wait a minute . Let him do it . Sir , our orders are no headshots , In case the skulls are dug up after we burn them . Oh . You mean like this ? [ gunshots ] [ both panting ] Jules , how did you do that ? I don 't know , I just did . But how did you know ? Ever since my recovery , I 've felt , uh ... Different . I mean , my eyes changed , but that 's not all . I don 't know how to explain it , but , uh ... The vectors seem to have lost interest in me . More like they 're afraid of you . Maybe they were . I have so many questions . We both know who has the answers . Brother . Brother . Don 't ever call me Eskimo again . [ door buzzes ] System voice : Level b . Alan : Sarah . What happened ? I should be asking you . Hatake : How could you not know She had a grade iv spinal tumor ? A spinal tumor ? Is she symptomatic ? She suffered a seizure about 20 minutes ago . Her pulse is weak , thready . I want to get her into the ICU as soon as possible . We can hook her into the life support we used on Peter . So , where is the core virus ? Gone , or never there . That 's ... Impossible ! Given the last nine days , You may want to remove that word from your vocabulary . How did you not know ? You didn 't know , right ? Alan : Maybe I didn 't want to know . I saw all the signs the tremors , the morphine . You can 't blame yourself . Except if I had known , I would have done the same thing . I needed her on the job more than I needed her healthy . She 's really good , Alan . She has the spark . [ softly ] we have the spark ... Sarah ? Sarah : Alan , wait for me . Wait for me until I finish my training . Sarah , just ... Just relax . Try to sleep , all right ? Sleep with me again , Alan . Maybe you should , uh ... Maybe I 'll ... I 'll get her stabilized . Of course . And ... And you can ... Jules . It 's fine . We 're divorced , remember ? Julia : You knew my mother . You built a replica of my childhood cabin . None of this is coincidence . Who the hell are you ? [ machine beeps ] This was one of the happiest days of my life . Me , you ... And your mother . That 's Jaye . But my mother 's name was ... Jane . Or to a four year old , Jaye . I 've waited for this day longer than you could possibly know . I was ... Afraid . Of what ? Rejection . I wanted you to ... Know me , But it was never the right time . What are you saying ? The cabin is not a replica . That 's not possible . Hatake : You never lived in Montana . No , that 's not possible . Who are you ? You have ... Your father 's eyes . [ scoffs ] Did we ever play with those ... Little cars ? Hot wheels . All the time . Was there a white one with , um ... The doors that opened ... Like wings ? Yeah . Up , not out . Heh . Like wings . That was my favorite . You punched me for it once . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! [ Tulok laughing ] Yes , I did . Even ? [ door opening ] We need to talk about what 's coming next . Ilaria will ... [ Balleseros groans ] Anana : Ugh . Tsk . You idiot . Sit . We don 't have any time . You can 't save the world if you 're bleeding to death . This is why women will always be the stronger sex .

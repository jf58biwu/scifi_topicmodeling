 The mid-2000s . The Cold War is back Western Europe 's population lives in cities . Areas called Grey Every Grey is surrounded by military complex In these complexes create a new generation of weapons . The most notorious is called Project Titus Titus . Meckinham Research 16 km north of Grey II . We are now at the test pilot four . She begins to show similar symptoms as the previous candidates . Despite their special evner are they not more immune to Titus than the rest of us . Scans DNA . Initiates eight hour time jump . Skipped successful . I think that Project Titus has a harmful effect on human psyche . 20 minutes have passed . The object coming in . Even limited use has caused long-term or irreversible damage . The project should be postponed until the defects are corrected . Grey 1 Financial District She should have been guarded . - We Saw no problems . There are always problems . Authorities have questioned ? No asking the right questions . She was eidetic . Fully functioning , Category 1 . Photographic memory . She needs to be replaced like for like . What do you mean ?

Good bye . Hey , Elle . It 's Dad . I 'm out of town for a few days . See you soon . Meckinham Research . Large vessels did build it during the conflict with China some years back . Should hide down here a few hundred years if we lost control . Some beers , some ladies . The money ran out , - - We moved . They think we do experiments on mice . What are you doing here ? Titus power cells recharged . Titus power cells recharged . Titus power cells recharged . Titus power cells recharged . Titus power cells recharged . - That was a long time ago . That I do not know . I strongly doubt that on . Sad to hear about your wife . - Upassende If I went to the funeral . - Yes . Why am I here ? - What is it ? I thought you were genius . - Show Him . Give him your watch . Warning . Scanning initiated . Warning . Scanner object . Good evening , gentlemen . Thank you for watching . You 've probably heard rumors sånå I 'll solve it for you . Project Titus was started as part of Deathcon Initiative . We examined teleportation . The idea of immediately putting boots on the ground anywhere in the world . Preliminary experiments showed that we could send matter through space and time . We had created a time machine . But there are ground rules . We can send through mechanical object but computer struggling to interpret them . 20 minutes is the maximum time outside the object 's timeline . After what we have seen evidence of celledestabilisering . It took them six months before they realized what they had . It scared them . Lab rat thought they had the key to the kingdom . Most landed on listening posts in Alaska . Those lucky , anyhow . Large vessels locked place and threw the key . Some years passed . And all great guys ran out of time . They were so obsessed with preserving the secret that nobody knew about it . Hubby was not one to let an opportunity go by . We tried to send through cameras , all kinds of recording equipment . Everything went through , but nothing worked . Heads . Therefore you use heads . Old-fashioned photographic memory . Best recording device that exists . And what are you recording ? - Smart , But not quick . - It Is well markets ? Imagine eight-hour head start against the world . Eyes on the future . Old-fashioned robbery in broad daylight . Do you have problems with it ? You go ahead eight hours memorizing what you see . Come back , give us the information and we place bets . It will provide power to your little journey . Power cells are homemade . Produced headquarters . Keeping them away from prying eyes . - I Would not do that , buddy . You said that the machine had a lock . - So It can not go backwards . Who will ? No profits there . You play the markets . Doing great business without risk . Those numbers give well around 5 % for you . Low rain . I want a share , not wages . Remember , 20 minutes . Do not be late . Scans DNA . Initiates eight hour time jump . Successful replication of DNA . 20 minute countdown starts . Hey , pay attention and look at the screen . 25 seconds remaining . The object must return to the platform . 20 seconds ... DNA replication successful . The object has returned . How did it go ? Government announces an independent investigation into unusual trading . As we previously reported , many brokers amazed a new trend . It is not the machine , that is particles . The machine focuses only power . Tituspartikkelen infect humans . We have evidence that Tituspartikkelen enters the object 's cell structure . There are no indications of fraud , but unusually large trade in perioder have led many to suspect insider or insider knowledge . - Perfect . Wait you any less ? No . I 've seen your work before . I 've seen your gift too . Gift ? I 'll tell you about my gift . All memories I create is here . Everything that goes into being there . There is no delete button . Nothing fades , nothing . All dirty . Shit . Every day I wake up and see my dying wife 's face in front of me . So clearly and vividly as you can imagine . It 's my gift . You 'll be more than happy to take over it . Welcome to the gutter . - I Must call Elle . - You Can procedure . There is no procedure . This is no operation . You are a common criminal now . Just as I am . Let me call . Want your little toy back ? Do you want that ? This is Elle . Leave a message so I call back . Good bye . He 's trouble . We can do this without him . No . We can not . Hello ? Hello ? Hell . 13 seconds left . The object must return to the platform . I want you to explain exactly what you saw again . At 12 today is my daughter and everyone else in the city away . My daughter is gone . Where the hell do you think you should ? Finding my daughter , warn people . Get as far away as I can . Where are you looking for her ? The lives of 12 million there . You have no idea she is . Should you go door to door ? - About I must . We need to know what is happening . That 's how you can save your girl . Anyone here ever fired at him . Have you thought about why ? He would probably not let me go ? - If You know him so well . - Gjorde He ? - When Hubby puts something started ... do not ask people questions . They 'd locked ourselves into if they knew . On a very dark place , in a very long time . What did you think we are ? Damn thieves . Evacuations have already begun . Your daughter is there . I prioritize her safety . You have my word . - Should Believe your word was worth nothing . - Tell When , say how . A time and a place . When you come back , you 're free to go . Scans DNA . Initiates eight hour time jump . Successful replication of DNA . 20 minute countdown starts . Happens girl something , remember that with pleasure . You and your damn ... It was here we lost power . - Smart . Not smart enough . - Was It you who hit ? - Yes . They lie in heaps , what ? I had hoped I was wrong . It 's Docklands . The port is the target . It 's headquarters . Shit ! The explosion occurs 12.10 today . The shock wave means 100 megatons . There is no dirty bomb . It looks as though Docklands is the goal . A big leap , Captain . A small device outside Glaviers plot started a chain reaction . Most of the city is destroyed ? Nevertheless , you can point out the exact epicenter ? I take the facts . I consider . I treat . - You Guessing . I 'm guessing never . I recommend ... Thank you , Captain . We can ... - Tell The passenger you took . You know how many rules you broke ? You brought him back . He would have died . - Tell Me , captain , how everything ends ? The object that was passed back is stabilized . The bullet grazed the skull . The damage is mostly superficial . The main problem is fjerningen of the object from its timeline . 20 minute limit is exceeded . Powerful cell activity has been detected . I recommend that the object immediately sent back to his own timeline . Al Jabbi came with the bomb threat from their own mobile . Although the suspect was unknown to the authorities , insist de that he was not listed or member of any radical Organization or have behaved suspiciously earlier . Al Jabbi was detained by special forces this morning . Shortly after was radical out on the streets and shots have been reported . The authorities will not allow violence to the peaceful communities . He has been outside its timeline for long . Massen his unstable . We need to get him back into the machine . - You Have not warned anyone ? - Evakueringen Has already begun . Do not lie ! TV is on in the rest room . No evacuation mentioned . Why ? You protect yourself ? Do not have a track to Titus ? What about Elle ? What about my daughter ? What about Elle ? Let me out , damn it ! Let me out ! Let me out ! My daughter , then ? Hi ! Hi ! Let me out , damn it ! Hi ! Let me out ! Hey , it 's me . You must do me a favor . I want to know if there are any interesting people in town today . I have you . Emmanuel Al Jabbi . No prior convictions . No links . Called in a bomb threat yesterday . They blow up a bomb in Docklands today . Must be them . The blast may be a chain reaction of a smaller charge . They know enough not what they want . We could probably defuse them . We have no time to chase astray . The resort is set on standby . We can stop it . That 's not good enough . We must disarm cells . - This Can be stopped , what ? But we 're in a hurry . Why can not give me Hector Emmanuel Al Jabbi ? Police took him yesterday . Bomb Threat from their mobile . His group was to attack one of our facilities in the Docklands . Their little charge would chain react with Haycocks Darlings . - We Go in first . - Difficult . He tags in the box . You must bring the box , the codes and open the door . We keep in touch with this . When I come to headquarters , then hold the door open . So I stop the bastards . Good luck . Remove the hard drive . I 'm in the area . 16 km away . It is best to have the doors open . Celleinstabilitet discovered . Pouch . Give me that . Put it on the floor and slide it here . Access To Headquarters Opens doors . Rez ! I 'm in . Drop it ! Drop it now ! I said drop it ! Rez , you hear me ? Something is wrong here . What are you doing ? This is Big Daddy . I missed the boat . Submit a second . I tried to do something special for you . - You Can still not see it . I can see everything . Clear as day . Incoming object . Incoming object . Warning . Warning . Recreates DNA . 20 minute countdown starts . Hello ? Hello ! 13 seconds left . The object must be immediately returned to the platform . Hello ? Hello ? Is there anyone there ? Hello ? Is there anyone there ? Hello ? Is there anyone there ? Hello ? I did not know that he did not send out the warning . I swear . - You Must believe me . - I believe you . - What do you want ? - You Will unlock the machine . You want to go back ? I hoped that I was wrong . 20 minute limit exceeded . Return to the platform . He has been outside its timeline for long . Massen his unstable . We need to get him back into the machine . You 're just a thief ! What about Elle ? What about my daughter ? What about my daughter ? Answer me , is she dead ? I am 16 km away . It is best that you have the doors open . Pouch . Give me that . Hello ! Celleinstabilitet discovered . You want to go back ? Celleinstabiliteten increases . The object must return to the right timeline . Shall we try this again ? You can not be here . Your cells are becoming increasingly unstable . Timeline will try to spit you out like a virus . You built it for him . Gave him the . People look back at certain flaws with fond memories . They forget . Forget how difficult it was . We stood on the edge . Politics gave us unlimited funds that would give us the upper hand . We soon realized what we had . And the dangers that exist . The decision was unanimous . Titus would be laid on ice . A small group of six people would suit storage . One of guards was young and took up to the top . - Haycock . - A After a dead guards . And so did the creators . Finally , it was just him and me . I 've seen the drawings , there are holes everywhere . You did not give him anything ? You did not provide the full potential . Eight Hours Lock is just that . A lock . It can return . Right ? Right ? I can still save her . Recovers it . - It 's Not that simple . She will not die . You can not change anything . I can change everything . How far back can I go ? We have never sent anyone back ... Guess . How far ? Maybe one day . Maybe two . We do not know . There are theories . We have never sent anyone back . - Then It 's your lucky day , right ? Warning . Tidlås broken . Warning . Tidlås broken . Initiated 24 hour retroactively time jump . Scans DNA . Initiates 24-hour retroactively time jump . Error . Error . Unauthorized jumps . Error . Error . Unauthorized jumps . I created you ! We did not see that there was a problem . No asking right questions . We have a bigger hole to fill . What do you mean , like for like ? No , taxes , it 's not about time . I do not know . If I had time , I could given time . But I do not know ... - Nødtelefonen . - Hear Me carefully . Listen . A bomb is going to explode at 24 : 10 tomorrow . The bomb found in a warehouse in Docklands . Back . Now ! Emmanuel Al Jabbi . Police arrested him last night . He called in a bomb threat from their own mobile . Where 's the little girl ? Obtaining money , then you get your girl back . Right ? The guard at the front gate ! - Where is she ? - Minnefyren To rescue the girl say . Where is she ? Hey , Elle . It 's Dad . I 'm out of town for a few days . See you soon . This is Elle . Leave a message so I call back . Good bye . We have found that prolonged use of maskinen or long time spent outside the object 's timeline - påvirker test pilot cell structure . Object that carries the particle becomes a very unstable source of power . The result of exposure to higher level of Tituspartikkelen is unknown . Rez . I 'm in . Rez , you hear me ? Something is wrong here . What are you doing here ? You tamed humanity 's greatest resource , and only saw dollar signs . - What are you doing here ? Do you really want to stop this ? What are you doing ? What are you doing ?

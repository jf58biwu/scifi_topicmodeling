 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Using the astrolabe unleashes a formidable evil . How could take such a risk with so formidable an artifact ? Warehouse was gone ! You were gone ! - Did I do wrong ? - No . I would 've done the same . I will not give you back the astrolabe . I don 't want it back . I want you to use it again . Take this and disappear . I 'll leave Leena my research on the dagger . Brother Adrian , have you ever been in South Dakota ? No , I have not . The Brother Adrian that Arthur has been battling never really existed . Whatever the effects of the astrolabe , I 'm afraid it 's caused Arthur to have some sort of psychotic break . Pete , was is it ? A vibe . Mykes , call the Warehouse . Leena ! Artie ! Are you here ? Come on , Artie . I got a really bad ... You got another one ? Worse than before . Way worse . Okay , I 'm gonna call Leena 's cell again , okay ? Yeah , call her , ' cause ... I don 't know . Maybe ... maybe she had to go out . - huh . That 's never a good sign . Okay . But don 't panic , all right ? They have to be here somewhere . Yeah , well since " here " is about the size of Rhode Island , I 'd say it 's a pretty good reason to panic . Pete ... I think I found them . I 'll take the Dark Vault . Yo , Artie , is everything o ... Artie . Artie ! Leena ? Aw , come on . Mykes , there 's nothing here but a mess . This place has been tossed . Myka , can you hear me ? Myka ? Pete , I , um ... just get to the Bronze Sector now . What is it ? Are you okay ? No , I 'm not . We 're not . Myka . Myka , are you ... My God , what ... She 's dead . What happened ? Someone shot her . Someone ... Someone killed her . Arthur . I 'm afraid Arthur took her life . No way ! Okay ? Artie would never ... No one is more disturbed than I am , Agent Lattimer . I realize it sounds unlikely . Unlikely ? Try impossible . Pete , I 've been telling you what 's happening . And in light of recent circumstances ... There 's no other explanation , is there ? I 'm afraid not . I made her a promise and now ... Sorry , all . It was such a nightmare getting back . They routed me through Boston because of weather . Tell me that makes sense . What ? That 's not true . That cannot be true . I 'm afraid so , Claudia . It would appear the prophesy of the astrolabe has come to pass . And an evil has been created . And that evil is Artie . When Robespierre used the astrolabe to turn French public opinion against the king , something ... something in him changed . It turned him against what he believed in . Which led to the Reign Of Terror . Tens of thousands died . So when Artie used it , it turned him evil and that 's why he ... killed Leena . He did not kill Leena ! Artie is not evil . He 's been whammied , just like we 've all been whammied at some point , right ? He never gave up on us , Mrs. Frederic . No matter what happened , no matter what we did . And I 'm not about to give up on him . Claude , no one is giving up on him . We 're looking for a way to heal him now . That 's why the three of you must find him before there are any other casualties . Okay , uh , the Dark Vault , it was trashed . So obviously , Artie was looking for the astrolabe , right ? He doesn 't have it . I entrusted HG Wells with the astrolabe . Even I do not know where she is . And so there 's no way he can get his hands on it . Nevertheless , you must be extremely careful . Arthur is a formidable enemy . An enemy who knows everything about us ... what we do and how we do it . And more worrisome , he knows us . Our strengths and our weaknesses . Don 't worry , Mrs. Frederic . We 'll find him . Pete . My God . My God ! My God ! My God ! Where 'd she go ? Where 'd she go ? Did you guys see her ? - Pete ... - She was right here . She ... it was Leena ! You didn 't you see her ? - Pete . - Come on , man . We all know this place does crazy things . She wasn 't here , was she ? It 's because she 's dead , right ? Because Leena ... so she couldn 't have been here . Pete . Could she ? Not very much is known about the provenance of Magellan 's astrolabe . I myself know only a small piece of its history . But if there are answers to be had , we will find them in here . Let us hope so . It is an impressive collection . We have a great respect for knowledge and its power ... And the revelation of new ideas , no matter what the source . - Really ? - Yes . We are under the protection of the Vatican , not under its rule . This is Robespierre 's diary . This section here is all he knew of the astrolabe . That is not a lot . It 's a beginning , Agent Jinks . We must begin somewhere . So , we know that Artie is looking for the astrolabe and he knows that it 's not here . Can we assume he doesn 't know who has it ? Probably . I mean , that 's what Mrs. Frederic ... Artie ? Artie ! My God . No , no . Don 't . Don 't . Don 't . I 'm sorry , there 's something wrong with me . I don 't feel like myself . Yeah , you 're really , really not yourself . Artie , do you even remember what happened ? No , I can 't . - It 's insane . - It 's the astrolabe . Because I used it , it 's affecting me somehow . Yes . That 's what we think too . And I 'm told that the only way to reverse the astrolabe 's effect is for me to use it again . Mrs. Frederic and Steve are looking for ... No ! There is no other way . I need the astrolabe . We 're sorry , Artie , but that 's not gonna happen . Artie , listen . You told us yourself that using the astrolabe again would destroy the Warehouse . HG , Steve , Mrs. Frederic ... they 'd all be dead . I 'm sure we can find something . And I am sure that the astrolabe is the only thing that can help me . Man , what the hell is that now ? - It 's the IRS Quartum . - My God . What 's the IRS Quartum ? The quartum is under control . Just for once , would you please listen to me and do as you are told ? Artie , please . Just let us ... You 're not real . I 'm quite real , I assure you . I 'm just not here . I have the HG hologram device . But what I do not have is the astrolabe ! Now , where is it ? We can 't let you have it , Artie . Well , you can tell me where it is or I could find it myself . Telling me where it is is the safer choice . Think what happened to Leena . Artie , we can help you . I know that we can fi ... " Artie , we can help you . " You still don 't understand . I am not Artie . Artie sacrificed his life for this place . He was a slave to this warehouse for 35 years , but no more ! I will use the astrolabe to set Artie free of this warehouse and from all of you , no matter what the cost . Guys , look , it 's one of those eye pole thingies . It 's not the HG hologram device , it 's one of Hugo 's . He 's somewhere in the Warehouse . Claudia . Claudia , get back ! Artie could still be in there ! I know , I know . Just wait . Fire extinguishers . I 'll seal off the quartum . All right , hurry , Claude , before it jumps to another section . Pete , here . Well , it looks like we lost Artie . We also lost half the IRS Quartum . That can 't be all bad , right ? I mean , who likes the IRS ? No , IRS stands for " Imperium Romanum Sacrum . " Holy Roman Empire . This is where we stored all the Warehouse 8 files from the Holy Roman Empire . Well , if anyone from Warehouse 8 shows up , they 're gonna be pissed . Artie 's hologram signal came from here but he had plenty of time to get away before we could reach him . - Why set the fire ? - To cover his tracks . Well , this has something to do with the astrolabe . There 's something in these crates that Artie didn 't want us to see . So we dig in , and figure out what he was after . Yeah . As soon as we un-burn all this stuff . Nothing . We have been at this for hours and we haven 't found anything to help Artie . There 's gotta be something else that we can do . Slow and steady , Agent Jinks . Slow and steady wins the race . This may be something . It 's an ancient Italian dialect , so if I might take the liberty of paraphrasing . Please , I insist . " If any man shall live the same day twice , " his reason shall fracture and he shall live his life as two until there is only one . " " He shall live as two . " A dual personality . That would be my interpretation . As darkness overcomes the light , so shall evil overcome goodness . That 's like Robespierre . He started out believing that the people of France could govern themselves but ended up using the guillotine to keep them in line . A scythe above all heads . If I 'm interpreting this correctly , the evil that is created comes from within . There it is , then . The explanation for what he 's done . Fractures can be healed . There has to be some way to reach the real Artie 's good side . Perhaps . But according to this , the darkness will eventually extinguish the light forever . If this happens , the Arthur that we know is lost . Well , considering what he 's already done , you should leave as soon as possible . I 'll start arranging it . Thank you , Brother Adrian . We 're in your debt . Yes , you are . And if all this works out , I 'd like to have my astrolabe back . The Holy Roman Empire hosted Warehouse 8 in Germany , from 1260 to 1517 . So what would Artie want in Warehouse 8 ? And then what does it have to do with the astrolabe ? I mean , according to this , Magellan 's astrolabe was never in the Warehouse . - How did he even get it ? - None of this makes any sense . That 's what 's bothering me . Artie always makes sense . So , what are we missing ? Well , it looks like some of the inventory didn 't get entered into the computer , so we should just check the manifest . Pete . No . No . No , no , no . No , no . You 're not real , you 're an aura or something . Aren 't you ? This is not gonna end well . Hello ? Leena ? Leena ? Wow . This all a bit dark and tortury . Okay . Show 's over . What are we ... doing here ? Hey . There . What is ... so what ... Is this Attila The Hun 's China cabinet ? Right . Nothing here and ... nothing in here . Because you 're not here . I 'm definitely gonna be one of those agents that goes crazy . But if I wasn 't crazy ... then you would have ... definitely would have ... brought me here for ... a reason . I 'm not crazy . Thanks , Leena 's spirit , for having our backs . That must be HG 's research . She told Leena what she was working on in case something untoward happened . But why was she worried ? Arthur asked her to find the dagger for him . He was obsessed with it , so obsessed , in fact , that HG became concerned . Because the dagger has something to do with the astrolabe ? No . Because of a vision he was having . A vision of what ? A recurring vision of you , Claudia , stabbing him with that particular dagger . He was determined to find it , prevent it from happening . Well , I would never do that . I mean , just because he dreamt it doesn 't mean it 's actually gonna happen , does it ? Not necessarily . And not not necessarily . Comforting . Artie 's mind is at war with itself . His dream could have meant anything or nothing at all . But the dagger means something . Leena showed it to me for a reason . I beg your pardon ? Look , Mrs. F , I 've been seeing Leena lately . Her ... I don 't know , her energy , her aura , or whatever . She showed me the dagger because it 's part of Artie 's plan . I 'm sure of it . I can feel it . Artie created and saw his dark side as Brother Adrian , right ? It would seem so . What if the dream was his dark side 's way of convincing him to find the dagger ? The dark side lied to good Artie because he didn 't tell him what the dagger was for . So whatever it 's for ... Which is not for me to stab him with . We can 't let him get to it . Then I suggest you find the dagger first . So , HG found out that the dagger belonged to the Fourth Duke of Gandia . He was a Spanish Jesuit in the 16th century , which was also during the Holy Roman Empire . And Warehouse 8 and why Artie was looking for something in the IRS Quartum . - Did HG find it ? - I don 't think so . There 's nothing in here about where this dagger is now . Well , if HG couldn 't find it , how do we ? We think like Artie , right ? We think like Artie . The flip side of Artie knowing us is us knowing him . And now that we know what he 's looking for , I can find a way to track him . - What are you looking for ? - Cyber footsteps . Everybody leaves ' em . You just gotta know how to track ' em . There he is . No . No . He knew that I would find that . So if I ... But he doesn 't know this little trick because it 's brand-new . I got him . He 's traveling under the alias Luther Wastrife . Luther Wastrife . That 's an anagram for Arthur Weisfelt . - You scare me . - See ? So , some part of Artie still wants us to find him . I just wish that part of him would tell us where he 's going . - Budapest . - What ? Just intercepted an e-mail . It seems he 's going to see a man about a dagger . All right . Look , Claude . I think that maybe you should ... Don 't worry . I 'm staying here . If I don 't get near the dagger , I can 't stab him with it , right ? Here 's hoping . Bye , Claude . I 'll slow down Luther Wastrife and figure out what Artie got out of those Warehouse 8 files . - Enjoy your stay here . - Thank you . Welcome to Budapest . Business or pleasure , Mr. Wastrife ? Pleasure . Looking up an old friend . Good . Just one moment please . Come with us , please . Of course . I hope everything 's all right . - So , we found it . - You got the dagger ? No , we found it , not we got it . The man that Artie was coming to see is an ambassador who loaned his art collection to a museum in Prague . And the dagger 's in that collection ? Well , we 're on our way to Prague now . Is there any new news about Artie ? Yeah . Funny thing . As it turns out , Luther Wastrife is a suspected terrorist . He 's being held by airport security at Liszt International in Budapest . Man , you are good . I 'm gonna get you a list of kids from the third grade that used to beat the crap outta me . You know , before I buffed out . Is there any new news about the dagger or about what Artie was looking for in Warehouse 8 ? Yeah . It 's all tied up together . So , apparently the deadliest artifact in Warehouse 8 was something called the Chinese orchid . Back in the 15th century , Europe tried to force China to trade with them . Now , China resisted . The emperor sent this artifact as a warning ... this strange blue orchid that released a disease called English sweating sickness . An artifact that makes you sweat to death ? Well , it worked . Europe backed off . English sweating sickness was an epidemic that killed its victims within 24 hours . No cure was ever found and then it disappeared . Exactly . When Warehouse 8 agents snagged and bagged the orchid . Now apparently , the orchid is so lethal they encased it in some kind of impenetrable container . Okay , wait . So , Artie is looking for a sharp pointy dagger and an impenetrable case . Is anyone thinking what I 'm thinking ? I think Artie is going to use the dagger to open the container and get the orchid . He 'll release an epidemic that potentially could wipe out half of the world 's population . He wants to make it so bad that we have no choice but to hand over the astrolabe and turn things back to the way they were . I hate to admit it , but it 's a pretty perfect plan . Thank God he 's in custody . Yeah , Mrs. Frederic 's on her way to Budapest to pick him up herself . Well , I hate to be in his shoes when she gets there . Arthur used the barometer of the USS Eldridge to stop time and escape . 47 seconds was all he needed . Don 't worry , Mrs. F. We 're on our way to the Czech museum now . We 'll snag that dagger before Artie even finds out it 's in Prague . Since I 've apparently been sent from Rome to Germany to chauffeur you , and since Mrs. F isn 't exactly a chatterbox , would you care to tell me what we 're doing ? We have to find the Chinese orchid before Artie gets the dagger . If we don 't , he 'll release the sweating sickness , we 'll have to give him the astrolabe , he 'll turn back time , the Warehouse won 't exist anymore , you 'll be dead , the world will lose hope and descend into chaos and despair . You want more ? I had a lot of caffeine on the plane . In the 16th century , the Fourth Duke of Gandia , - a Spanish Jesuit ... - Stop ! You had me at " You 'll be dead . " - Now , where are we going ? - Warehouse 8 . Well , what used to be Warehouse 8 to snag the Chinese orchid . It causes a deadly plague . Okay . So where is Warehouse ... Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Pete and Myka get a dagger , and we get a plague ? When do we stop being the " B " team ? We are not the " B " team . Fool , we are the second " A " team . We can 't go after the dagger because Artie had a dream I 'm gonna stab him with it . So that 's why we 're the ones going after a plague that could wipe out all of humanity . Thank you . I feel better . This is Warehouse 8 ? No , this is a German insurance company ... built over where Warehouse 8 used to be . This way . The orchid is super dangerous . So instead of keeping it in the Warehouse , they buried it way below . Then when 8 was abandoned for 9 , they thought it was too unstable to move . So they just left it here ? Buried super deep in an impenetrable airtight container . So don 't worry about contracting an incurable disease . Just worry about the spiders . Spiders ? I just ... I can 't stop thinking about it . We 've never lost anyone before . Not like this . I know . Just try and keep focus on what we 're doing here and maybe ... Who am I kidding ? I can 't stop thinking about it either . But you know what , whatever happens , we are still family . And we will get through this , I know it . Yeah ? Well , I don 't . Leena isn 't just dead , Myka , Artie killed her . Even if we get him back , how are we going to tell him what he did ? - Is he even gonna remember it ? - I don 't know , Pete ! I don 't know if he 's gonna remember , and I don 't know how we 're gonna tell him , okay ? But that is on tomorrow 's list , okay ? Today 's list is find the dagger , stop Artie . So let 's just ... let 's just get through today . That 's where the ambassador 's collection is being displayed . Nice . So , you and Mrs. Frederic must 've found out something else about the astrolabe . Not really . Hardly anything 's been written about it . " Not really . " " Hardly anything . " Please quantify . Brother Adrian is still digging , okay ? I 'm sure he will find something else . I mean , you know , something . What aren 't you telling me ? Nothing . You know , for someone who can tell when someone else is lying , you are a ... Terrible liar . Yes , I 've heard . So stop it . Just tell me . Okay . Everything we found so far says we can 't heal Artie without using the astrolabe again . And given what that would do to the world , that means ... we can 't heal Artie at all . We 're not gonna lose Artie . They said we couldn 't bring you back and here you are . We 'll find a way to bring Artie back . This is it . Warehouse 8 . God , I don 't know why I bother doing my nails . I know . My cuticles are a mess . It 's gotta be down there somewhere , right ? Come on . We are so the " B " team . There . See ? That wasn 't so bad , was it ? Well , I 'm kinda wishing that we drop some bread crumbs . Relax , Hansel . I highly doubt there 's an evil witch down here who 's gonna eat us . Stranger things have happened . - Figures , right ? - I say we let ourselves in . It 's from the IRS Quartum . Brass keys don 't burn . Welcome ... to Warehouse 8 . Not to state the obvious , but , " uh-oh . " No . No uh-ohs . It 's here . It has to be here . I don 't see how . It 's just an empty cave . Hey , wait a sec . What about this ? What do you think ? Is this a clue or ... just bad cave art ? Given the circumstances , let 's go with clue . Although I wish it looked at least a little bit like an orchid . Yeah , me too . Ooh , Mykes look . This thing looks like a Klingon battle axe . - Do you think they 'd mind if I ... - Yes ! Yes . I do think that they would have a problem with it . We 're here to find the dagger , all right ? So what do we know ? We know that it 's from the 16th century . Right . So ... That 's it . Pete . - How did he know ? - Doesn 't matter . Hey , Artie , old bean ! Fancy meeting you here . I mean , what are the chances , right ? Don 't do anything foolish . Artie ... Listen to me . We can help you . You wanna help me ? Give me the astrolabe . You know we can 't do that Artie . Just come back with us . We can work this out . You 're an idiot , Pete . You 're a dancing monkey , just one bad decision away from the bottle . You really think that Artie wants to be your substitute father ? Playing daddy to a weak-willed six-year-old trapped in an aging man 's body still whining about letting his real father die in a fire when you should have saved him ? Artie , stop . And you , with your uncompromising , prudish rigidity , and your condescension , and your infuriating belief that you 're always the smartest one in the room . You 're on a direct path to spending the rest of your life alone . Don 't you understand ? Artie wants you out of his life ... forever . Artie , don 't ! What 's tha ... It 's a noose that belonged to Isaac Parker . He was the most famous hanging judge in the old west . Now I 'm finally done with you . It 's tight . We need to get to the noose . It 's getting tighter . I got it . I got it . That was amazing . Well , today was not a good day to die . - Yeah . - And I am not an idiot . Pete , I know . All that stuff that he was saying about my dad and about you , is that what he really thinks ? No , that 's not what Artie thinks . It 's what he knows what we fear about ourselves . I mean , that 's not our Artie , right ? Yeah . Well , evil Artie really likes pushing our buttons . Now he 's got the dagger . Let 's go get him . Wait . Watch . What are you doing ? You 're from the Warehouse . So you don 't have the dagger ? No . Artie has it . And you don 't have the orchid . Well , no . No . But ... well , we do have a clue . Maybe . You 're absolutely right , Agent Donovan . We do have a clue . That symbol was left there specifically to be found by Warehouse agents . So what , we 're looking for a stolen bridge ? No , no , no . The precise word for bridge in German is " Brucke . " And stone is " Stein , " Stein Brucke ? Franz Steinbruck to be precise . Who 's he ? He was the Artie of Warehouse 8 . Whoa , whoa . Stop , stop . He 's from Warehouse 13 . How do you know ? He has yogi Ray Bengali 's cobra . He showed it to me . And what is the cobra doing out of the Warehouse ? So you would know me . Arthur Nielsen , and you must be Carl and Anya Steinbruck . Yes . Well , thank you for coming . I apologize about the circumstances , but I 'm here about the orchid . You told him about the orchid ? It 's all right . He already knew . I realize this is very difficult for you and I know the generations of Steinbrucks have guarded the orchid . Since it was buried beneath Warehouse 8 . And when the Third Reich started to rise and there was a fear that the Nazis would find the orchid and use it for their own ends , your family moved it , yes ? We kept it safe . Yes , well , once again the orchid is in danger . There are people after me . Dangerous rogue agents and they want the orchid for their own agenda . It 's only a question of time before these people catch up to me . You must show me where the orchid is . - Come with us . - Wait . Wait . Wait . These are very clever people . And they will say anything to get the orchid . But it will be a lie . Remember . A lie . So ... We haven 't moved the orchid since it was brought here in 1939 . Very wise . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . - I think Johan and I ... - Stop ! Don 't trust him . - Hands in the air ! - Give up your weapon . He wants to use the orchid on us . On all of us . Yeah , yeah . Blah , blah , blah . Wiener-schnitzel ! The only way you 're getting to that orchid Artie is through us and that ain 't happening . You 've already lost this battle , Pete , only you 're too stupid to know it . I know you 're in there , Artie . I know you can hear me . So , please , before anyone else gets hurt , just let us help you . All you 've gotta do is trust us . It is you . You are still there . Now , Johan . Cover your ears ! Claudia , you and Steve head off the Steinbrucks before they get to the orchid . We 'll go after Artie . - Nice shot . - Thanks . - We were trained for this . - We 're the good guys . Claude ! Hey , you okay ? Go ! I 'll handle Heidi . Yeah ? Sprechen sie headlock ? Mykes . Duck ! Pete ! Get the dagger out of here . Go , Mykes , go ! I got it . - I don 't wanna shoot you . - I will kill you if I must . Hey . You missed . - I know . - But I won 't . Sometimes I miss the quiet of the ATF . Did you find the orchid ? No , but it 's gotta be around here somewhere . Myka , here . What ? I 've been seeing this a lot lately . It 's beautiful . It 's hard to believe it 's so deadly . Maybe we should leave it hidden . No , it 's too risky . We need to take it back to the Warehouse and lock it . Or you could just hand it to me . You know I 'm capable of this . That 's right . Good . Good . And I 'll take that dagger too . Myka , don 't . I 'll do this right in front of you . Bring that to me now . Do it . No ! Good job , partner . All right then . Artie , look . It 's over . The dagger is gonna be ground to pieces , so just ... let him go . You still think that you 're the smartest one in the room ? This is over when I say it 's over . - He 's gone . - He 's going after the dagger . - And he 's got the orchid . - Artie , don 't ! You 'll kill millions of people . It 's not too late . I know you 're still in there . I know you can hear me . I know what I 'm doing . Saving Artie from all of you . You , you 're the worst of them . You 're an insolent , annoying child who will never be a woman ... Who only wants everybody to love her . Here 's the truth : Artie doesn 't love you . He doesn 't love any of you . You 've ruined his life . Artie ! I cast you out ! Think they can beat me . - My God . - The arrogance . I cast you out . And now . Claudia , do it . Save me . I cast you out ! Claudia , no ! I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It 's okay .

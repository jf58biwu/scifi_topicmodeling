 That was so ... I mean ... I mean it was ... I know . Does it ever ... does it ever stop being so ... No . Do you ever get used to it ? No . Every single time is a miracle . Every single time , humbling . How come no body knows ? People know . You don 't understand there is literally no where for you to stay here . Well I 'm not much of one for creature comforts so , ah , I could always crash here in the pews . - I 'm sorry father , that 's not going to happen . - Deacon ! I have my assignment , the decision has been made . I suggest we both just make the best of it . We have a storage room above the kitchen . I 'm sure we could find a spot for you in there . People know . Well ... well not enough , this is proof , Deacon . Divine power ... this ... this could change the world . For the better ? Fear is not the same as faith father . It ... It 's like you 're ... like you 're ah ... Like you 're touch by grace ... I know . It 's all real . Is that what it makes you think ? It 's all true . What is , father ? The church , man , something else ? What truth you look to find in him Andrew ? He 's a man . But this could silence so much debate . No , they would make of him a false idol . No greater sin could we visit upon him than that . No , father , this we cannot let happen . People deserve to know . Do they , Andrew ? Why ? What are you doing Christopher ? What makes them so deserving in your eyes ? Look around , father , hate is easier than love . To put him out there today would be like feeding him to the lions . Does anybody know ? You know , I know . People know ; it isn 't a secret . The church ? The Friar and some others must , why else a deacon in just a tiny outpost of Christendom . The Friar ? In time perhaps , Andrew . In time . Do you play chess father ? You should learn . You can tell a lot about a man by how he plays . His temperament , his state of mind . You should learn . How long deacon ? Too long , he 's older than you can imagine . How many times , how many times have you done this ? I 've lost count . Deacon Fletcher brought me here to mentor when I was younger than you . We have a responsibility to him . Please , Father , for his sake . For his sake ? A word of advice . I would be thinking about yourself right now . Now , if you help me bring him in , I can plead for leniency on your behalf . I can 't do that . Who the hell do you think you are keeping this to yourself ? This is the worst kind of heresy imaginable . You don 't understand . No you don 't understand . You 're a Deacon in an eastside slum and you have no business trying to handle this . It isn 't something you ever forget . The first time you witness it . Is it ? It seems like a long time ago . You don 't notice the years pass , father . But they do . For all of us . For him to . Deacon ? Imagine , father , living forever , or however long God wishes his journey to continue . How would you fare . But it 's a miracle . It is , and wondrous too but .. But what ? But this isn 't a reward . Something was done . Something he was a part of . Something he must atone for . What ? Does it matter to simple men of the cloth ? He is a soul in need . I don 't understand . His world is fragile , father , if you can imagine him as such . Everything passes him by , and he alone is left to endure . Forever perhaps . Imagine that father , forever . How do your beliefs from five years ago stack up today ? What about today 's in twenty , forty , how about a hundred , a thousand ? Everything passes him by and only his faith is left to him . And he and world no longer share that . Faith ? Yes. father , faith . His touch with humanity is precarious , that 's where you and I come in . Deacon , I ... the church ... I just ... I don 't know anymore . Everyone 's faith is different , father , unique . None have the same needs . Faith grows with us . But .. God has many names , father , faith is the one that spans all religions . You don 't understand . I understand more than you know . Andrew . No , you don 't , Deacon . I ... I need some more time . I know what happened , Father . I know . It 's why I sought you out . You have another chance father . You are need here , now . The choice is yours . One thing Andrew , he will not stop you serving God after your own calling . Remember though , in a fight , we are not he .

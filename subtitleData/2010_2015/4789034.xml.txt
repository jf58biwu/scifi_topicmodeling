 - Not having it ? - No . - Can I have it ? - Sure . Okay ... Newsdesk . Please leave a message . The bombing at Hubmarket was made by Real Humans Liberation Front . We demand that all hubots are banned from today 's society . This was the first warning . If proper action isn 't taken by the government , warning two will be issued . Soon ... You have reached your destination . Why did you leave me ? - You let Leo go . - I had to . We 'll wait for him as long as we can . If he 's arrested , you know what you have to do . Maybe it 's in his digital memory . It 's auditory information in the bio brain . David was meticulous about that . If Leo hasn 't moved it to his digital unit , which would be convenient , just open the skull and take it out . Watch out for the drunk . REAL HUMANS Oh , thank you . I want hot cocoa . I 'll make it . Have you farted ? No . Quiet . - What are you doing , Tobias ? Translating an swedish essay into english . I was wondering why you were up this early . - Could I please be allowed to use Anita ? - We have a great dictionary you can use . Sorry . Tobbe ? What is it ? Just checking if you wanted a ride to school . No , I don 't . Okay . Bye . We 're going to the class now . Lennart . Lennart ? Lennart ! ? - So , let 's go . - Yes . Mom , I need to talk to you . Honey , I 'm really late , can 't we meet for lunch today , and talk then ? Yes ? Come on in . Here . I have read it now . Three times . It 's yours . Thank you very much . - And what did you think ? - I like it alot . I wish that I was human . Then I would believe in God . And his light would fill me and guide me . - But can 't you , as it is ? - Am I allowed to ? Of course you are . If you want to . Maybe you 'd like to come to the church sometime ? When I officiate service . Thank you . Niska told me to get you . We 're only allowed to be in the attic . She asked me to come when I finished the book . - Just saying what Niska told me . - I can come to the church with Åsa . Sounds like a party . Yes ... But not sure about " party " . I was being ironic . I think it sounds boring . Oh ... Aren 't we going back ? - Maybe it took me awhile to find you . - But I 'm here ... I mean , that 's what we tell Niska , if she asks . Lie ? That 's right . What is that supposed to be ? Squares . Who wants to look at squares ? What are you doing here ? You can 't be down here . Back to the attic . - I 'm sorry , we 'll go ... - Get lost ! Homo freak . What did you say ! ? Could you say that again ? - What 's going on ? - You know what that machine called me ? Homo freak . - Interesting . - Thank you . - We have to let our hair down . - You 're right about that . It 's a flying fish . A drunk , flying fish . You two . Excuse me . Well , I just wanted to say it 's great that you 're having fun , but stuff like this is better at home . I 'm trying to teach the basics and you disturb the others . - Okay . - Good . Your place or mine ? - Now ? - Sorry ... Just kidding . Why don 't you ... call me and we 'll get together for some mischief ? Sure . - So you have my number then ? - No ... - Thanks . - Men ... We 'll put this in here . Do you remember me ? Do you remember your own name ? Leo Eischer . Yes . I 'm your father , Leo . Why didn 't you let me die ? What are you saying ? I want to be with mom . Mom is dead . She 's gone . But you 're alive . And I 'm alive . I want to be dead . I want to be with mom . - You 'll get exactly what you want . - No , daddy ! - You will get to die . - No , daddy ! Daddy , no ! - Just as you want . - No ! Leo . Come here . You wanted to die . How does it feel ? Remember how it feels to die ? You rather die than live ? Can you see your mother ? I want to live ! - What do you want ? - I want to live ! 80 degrees , so he 's been dead for 2-3 hours and still show full brain activity . And we found this in his pocket . His temperature is rising . 81.3 F. - Can you hear me ? - His arm is getting warm . - Pulse at 70 bpm . Pulse rising to 95 bpm . - Is he speaking ? - Not a word . I have to run . All information , all journals , - Everything about this patient is classified and not be entered into the database . This afternoon I will meet with the staff that 's had contact with him . - Sorry , we have our regulations . - Do as I say if you want to keep your job . - Without proper care , he 'll die . - We have our own doctors . He has serious infections that requires a specialist , and I am that person . Basically , we both want him to survive . If I 'm required to swear secrecy , I will . Then you will have to apply for leave of absence . I said I was sorry . - She said you called her " Home freak " . - What ? I said I was sorry . - They make us a great favor . - They risk going to prison . - I would never say such a thing . - She 's sure that you did . It 's because they hate us . That woman wants us out . - They make this up to get rid of us . - Either way , I want you to apologize . Never . No way . So we 're all out of here , just because you 're stubborn ? Answer . I have apologized ! I said I was sorry ! You cannot behave like that . Gordon . - Did you hear Flash apologize ? - What did she say , Gordon ? She said , that other thing . Sorry ... You know only the fat , ugly , old , weak , cripples and decievers join the church . So I guess you fit right in . You just have to apologize . Is that so hard ? I apologize for what I said . I 'm sorry . It certainly won 't happen again . Okay . - Thank you , Flash . Don 't mention it . You know , I 'm still curious as to how you could blurt out something like that . How are you constituted ? Who planted these opinions in your robot brains ? Flash 's opinions , are her own . We don 't agree with her . Don 't try to talk me into that you have emotions . Eva , stop it . You 're upset . What she said was wrong , but don 't go there yourself . Okay , Åsa . I will now address Flash , like I would a living person . Why does my sexual orientation provoke you ? What is it that makes you agry over the fact that I love a woman ? I said I was sorry . You can 't answer me , because you 're no one . You 're nothing . Eva , I end this now . I think women should be with men to have children and be happy families . You 're a robot ! No feelings , no womb , no nothing ! - That 's enough . - Maybe you agree ? No , I don 't agree with her , but I don 't have to offend her . The prudent priest is talking . - Together we will talk to Flash . And make her see the error of imposing her values onto others . Okay . Good . You can go now , Flash . Where have you been ? - Had to drive mom to the hospital . - Serious ? - Broken leg . - How old is she ? 92 . Do you just appear very young ? 62 . I ... I haven 't had time for breakfast yet . I 'm a bit ... Congratulations , on your 50th birthday . Wow . Open it . It 's nothing special . Oh , that was nice . Well , the bomb from last night . No one 's in custody . There 's some video to go through . A possible witness if he survives . The bombing was claimed by The Real Humans Liberation-whatever . - Who 's the injured witness ? - The owner of the store . - And this ? - Found at the scene . A Humax G-75 , isn 't it ? See if you can get any data off it . - You heard me ? - Yes , sure . I have to run . Thank you . It 's Ove . Yes ... You 're sure ? It is him ? Good , we 're on our way . Bea , they grabbed him . Our murder suspe ... ct . What are you doing ? Freeze ! Hands on the counter . Goddamnit ... Ove Holm here , alert all units and put out an APB on Beatrice Novak . Yes ! She 's a fucking hubot ! Move it ! Well , it 's just a minute past . I 'm sorry . - Pilar . - Göran Peters . I represent Evening Event AB , your counterpart in this case . As you know , my clients declined the settlement offer . Exactly . So we 're heading for the court . - Some people can 't be bought . - Pilar ... Well , that 's why I asked for this meeting . To be clear , we have withdrawn our offer . And it won 't be offered again . Fine . I 've done research into ... Well , whatever you want to call this . Transhumanism , or if you 're " hubbies " . It seems to be a global phenomenon . Internet sites , festivals , associations and magazines . These are printed and distributed in countries without our hubot legislation . Are you familiar with any of these ? " Playbot " , " Hub Love " , " Trans Machine " , " Hubot Secrets " . - Is it illegal to read them ? - No ... But to print and distribute them , constitutes a crime of conspiracy . In these you can find manuals to lift the Asimov restrictions , and how to remove owner-ID . Anything you can think of . Have we made these ? You use this against us ? You 're on trial here . Of course ... In our defense , we 'd like to perform an independant examination of your hubots . To find out if they 're legal . What 's their names ... Rick and Bob ... Bo . There ... Will you throw it away . Are you all right ? Just tear gas . - How could this happen ? - It will be investigated . You never noticed anything about her ? Nothing that would lead me to believe this . And you work at EHURB ... How many hubots have you mistaken for human ? None . I heard you got him and closed the investigation . That 's right . He will soon surface in our bomb investigation . He drove the owner 's car . Isn 't EHURB under enough strain as it is , with the personnel issues ? Check the necks of your people too . I want to talk to you . I 'm done talking for today . If you 're to stay with us , something like this cannot happen again . Ever . What I say goes . We behave , like I say we behave . - Do you understand that ? - Yes . Vera ! Her real name is Mimi . Oh ? The food was okay ? - Nice restaurant you picked out . - Don 't you think ? I can tell , you don 't believe a word I said . But honey . Independant hubots ? That sounds like ... I don 't know . Anita is a machine . You can input any information into her . She comes from this David . She 's one of his liberated hubots . That 's what her mark means . You 've seen it . It 's so cool . All hubots disappeared and no one 's found them . Until now . - Anita was found , it seems . - Yeah ... Maybe all of them are converted , like she is . You don 't think we should do something about this ? No . Hello , Vera . I 'll be there as soon as I can . What ? Grandfather 's had a heart attack . Now we 'll talk , you and I. Do you hear me ? Can you hear ? Do you speak Swedish ? I want a lawyer ... That 's enough for now . If you want him alive , he needs to rest now . - What are you doing ? - You rest . - What are you doing ? - I 'm getting out of here . From us ? From you . And from you . - No ... - Yes . Where are you going ? I 'm going back ... To be with a real family with children , just as it once was . To do what I 'm meant to do . I don 't understand . I have made up my mind . I can 't stand it another second . And this time ... This time , you won 't tell ! Do you understand ? Yes ... Goodbye , Gordon . Let her go . I must say , I 'm deeply impressed with the actions of Lennarts hubot . Without her , it would have gone ... Well , to hell , put simply . I just did my job . Very few humans , if any , would have done the same . Thank you . The positive side of this , is that we 're prepared , so it won 't happen again . I 'll be back later . That 's the guy they picked up . Run it again . Stop there . A few frames back . A few more . A few more . Not that bloody far ! Sorry ... - Can you enlarge it ? - No . Three . Hell , Roger . We should go out sometime and grab a beer . Hook up with some chicks . I know the meat markets . - You do ? - Yeah . And hunt like lions , you know , a team . Not picking the primes , just older or chubby ones . It 's the female lions that does the hunting . - You 're kidding . - No . And the males do what ? - Roger , someone to see you . - Me ? - Yes . Down in the lobby . - Who is it ? - No idea . - How are you ? - Fine . I can tell you don 't like your work much , and I 'm trying to relocate you , but it 's ... - I like it here . - You do ? That 's good . You know my door is always open if you any problems . Sure , sure . - Hello , Roger . I left my man yesterday , and he didn 't care much for that . - Are you married ? - Cohabitant . His name is Ove . I didn 't know you ... No ... Since I didn 't love him , I didn 't want to talk about him . You think I should go back to him ? No , why ? Of course you shouldn 't . I 'm so scared of him . I 've got no place to stay . Will you take care of me ? If I leave Ove . Of course . And you won 't change your mind tomorrow ? Or in a week , or a year ? No , never . He threatened to kill me . Bastard ... I don 't dare go anywhere . I 'll wait here for you , then we go home . Then we go home . It 'll be all right . Normally I 'd like you to stay for another week , but with magnificent Vera by your side , I thought I 'd release you today . You know you have a private health and life insurance ? I signed it when my wife was still alive . Don 't know why I thought she would outlive me , but ... It grants you a digital clone . You had one made ? What 's that ? A scan , with voice print and profiling , to make a hubot copy . The hubot is not included but the digital clone is and that 's worth $ 30.000 . Why would I ? For the surviving relatives . Grandkids , great grandkids . It doesn 't hurt to have . Strange ... Now you know and if you 're going to use it , I recommend doing it soon . And maybe I should tell you ... It could be a valuable asset for medical research . Malte is here . Hello ? Hello . - What are you doing here ? - We have to talk . - I thought we 'd lay low . - And we are . - Okay ... - Heard anything from Bea ? Yeah ... We talked ... It was cool ... A knew a girl would spell trouble . They 're so fucking sensitive . Seriously , Roger . I 'm worried . She wasn 't there when we did it . - I 'm afraid she 'll talk . - I think it 's cool . It 's not cool . Nothing 's cool anymore . We 're at war , get it ! ? She 's spilling her guts right now . I can fucking feel it all over . I said I talked to her . - She said what ? - That it 's cool . Sometimes you 're so fucking stupid , that I 'd like to knock you out . She 's a fucking cop ! And why doesn 't she call me ! ? I don 't know . Because she knows I 'd see right through her . How could I be so stupid as to believe in her ? Fuck ! She 's sitting out there . What did you say ? She 's sitting out there , in my car . - Why didn 't you say that right away ? - I don 't know ... What the fuck is going on ? - How the hell did you know I was here ? - Malte , I didn 't ... Now , you 're the one telling me what the fuck is going on ! Okay ... Put it down . Shit , Malte . Put it away , please . Malte ? Me and Roger are quitting . We 've done it , it 's enough and we 're quitting now . - We can 't do it anymore . - We 're on a different path together . - We don 't want to see you again . - Put it down , Malte . Therese and Pilar hadn 't told me , so I wasn 't prepared . We were screwed . And all I say is ... Wonderful . Oh ? I didn 't have much faith in this , but you made me falter for awhile . I 'm sorry . Forget about it . I have the sloppy movers to attend to , and the feud about the pine tree . How about a criminal defense case ? - What did you say ? - I don 't know much , but ... Military intelligence wants you to represent someone in their custody . HOW ALIKE WILL THE CLONE BE ? Well , hello . I thought we could fool around a bit , you and I. If you 're up to it . Thank you . Tobbe . Can we talk ? No , thanks . I don 't want to shout out here . Could you let me in ? - How are you , buddy ? - Why ? Is it grandad ? He 'll be fine . Is it ... that thing in the bookcase ? I 'm lousy at throwing stuff away . - You hid it and it was opened . - Yes , well . Yes ... But it 's not so strange to save it ... in case ... not now , but ... - Tobbe , I don 't know . - And now it 's gone . Yes , but I haven 't used it . - You haven 't ? - No ! That would be totally ... Sick . Yes . It is sick . Totally fucking sicko ... - Have you .. ? - No , I haven 't but ... There 's something wrong with me . Okay ... I need help , or something . - Help to .. ? - Don 't you get that I can 't tell you ? It 's about how you feel about Anita , and stuff ? We can get rid of her . I won 't make any difference . I will get someone you can talk to , who knows about this . A professional . And don 't tell anyone . Not even to mom . Promise me that . Absolutely . This is between us , Tobbe . The arrested man . Him . Is currently in isolation . He 's in bad shape and the speculations about what he is , has been running wild . We don 't know . He 's currently being examined by specialists . He has connections to the murders . Due to the event at EHURB yesterday , all personnel , in all departments , will be subject to control measures . Officially , the exposed unit , claiming to be Beatrice Novak , has been dismissed on the grounds of deception against the state . - Bea ? - I 'll be out soon , honey . " The rich dress of friendly verdure , " " has adorned dale and meadow . " " Now the mild breezes gently touch the herb fields . " " And the light of the sun , and the whispering of the grove , " " and the murmur of waves against willow , " " proclaim that summer is here . " " Their happiness and summer calm , the whirling birds are praising . " " From the bushes of the woods , from their quiet nests ... " The police , please . What do you think will happen now .. ? If I can 't feel anything . Huh ? They never imagined that we one day would copy ourselves and give it life . I 'm talking about our friends , the hubots . " Machines " , many say . In that case , these machines save our lives , take care of our children . And execute the dangerous tasks , so we won 't have to . They 're machines that dream and yearn . 200 years ago , the same was said about the population in Africa . It was said , they lacked a spritual life . That they were like machines . That you could own them , and that they 'd work until they break . Today , in disgust , we look upon slavery and the view of human life at that time . - How will they look upon us in 200 years ? - Wait up now , Åsa . With all due respect . Hubots are machines , open one up and see for yourselves . So what 's the difference between us and the animals ? Just open us up and look . So , let us pray . " Our Father in heaven , hallowed be your name . " To compare this machine to humans 200 years ago is disrespectful . To us and God . Get him out of here . He doesn 't belong here with us . " Our Father in heaven ... " - Stop it . Leave him alone . Gordon , run !

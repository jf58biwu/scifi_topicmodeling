 Previously on touch : look right there.Teller 's giving jake something . What is it ? I 'm not sure , but ten minutes later , he was dead . " 1188 . " i 'm off jake 's case . This is about the girl in room 6 . the chromatic scale consists of 12 tones . Arranged in time and sequence , these 12 simple tones create an infinite variety of music . Harmony and dissonance , tension and resolution- - all can be described by the mathematical ratios between tones . Could we translate all ratios into sound ? we could hear the music of the spheres ; a sound as immense , as powerful as the universe itself , as quiet as a single stone . as beguiling of the human heart . For some , music elevates the spirit to a place of transcendent beauty . Others simply hear the beauty in numbers themselves . you really got that thing figured out , don 't you ? Wow , you use numbers to make music . You know what else you can do with that thing ? You can use numbers to make words . Can I show you ? Jake , here . Look . see ? each number equals a letter . One equals a , two equals b , three equals c , and so on . So let 's say you 're cold . You put three , 15,12 and four , and it comes up " cold . " See , if you use words , I will know what you want , what you need . So if you 're cold , i 'll know to get you a sweater . Do you want to try ? Come on , buddy . mr.Bohm. I 'll be right back . Sorry to keep you waiting . Never a dull morning around here . You wanted to see me ? Miss hopkins arranged for me to take jake for the day . We 're gonna go to central park . The zoo , rowboats , the works . To be honest , Mr. Bohm , that doesn 't seem like a very good idea . I 'm sorry you feel that way . I think it is a good idea . Last time I checked , you don 't have full legal physical custody , so if you 'll excuse me . Come on , buddy . Let 's get your backpack . - How 'd it go ? - You were right . All I had to do was say the magic three words . " legal physical custody " strikes fear in the heart of every social worker . Hey , she lied about someone being in room 6 . When you questioned her on it , she took you off of jake 's case . She hiding something . Come on , buddy . Teller gave jake the key to all of his research . Ten minutes later he winds up dead ? - Meaning what ? - I don 't know yet . It just doesn 't feel right . The sooner we get access to teller 's research and go through his papers , the sooner we will figure this out . - hey , jake , jake ! - Oh , I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . I didn 't see him . Is he all right ? - Yes , he just gets upset . Thank you very much . - Okay , no apologies . Come on , buddy . It 's all right . Jake , come on , jake . It 's all right . There you go . Oh , damn it . He 's soaking wet . Why don 't you take him home , get a clean shirt ? I 'll go ahead . I can meet you there . Okay , we 're only a couple blocks away . Here 's the key . We 'll be right behind you . Okay . Come on , buddy . Let 's go home .

Jake ! Jake ! jake , there 's some things children never touch . Do you understand me ? Never ! Guns are very dangerous . Empty . " 5512454424 " jake , where the hell did you find this gun ?

My name is clea hopkins . Did you know arthur teller ? He rented the space . We were roommates . Are you here to collect his things ? So you know he died . People live . People die . Jake , is this the spot ? Is this where you found it ? Jake , slow down . jake ! Stop ! Don 't you move . You looking for something ? 'cause you sure look like you lost something . Like maybe a gun ? 'cause my son found a gun in this alley . Where is it ? I need it back . What are you , 12 ? 13 ? What were you doing with a gun in this alley anyway ? Look , I 'm not gonna call the cops on you okay ? - Obviously , you 're in some kind of trouble . Maybe we can help you . - I don 't want your help . Right now you don 't have a choice . You and I are stuck together , understand ? 'cause I 'm not giving you that gun back , and you 're not leaving here until you give me some answers . Fine . - what 's the matter with the kid ? - Excuse me ? Why doesn 't he talk ? He 's different . He uses numbers to talk . Why would you ask me that ? My brother doesn 't talk either . Maybe he could show my brother how to talk with numbers , too . Where is your brother now ? jake , jake . martin . I 'm sorry we 've abandoned you . Something 's come up . We 're gonna be even later . - Where are you ? - The bronx . Look , I need to ask a favor . Jake led me to this kid who 's taking care of his older brother . So far , I 'm not getting any straight answers , but as far as I can see , they 're completely on their own . I was hoping you could phone family services , see if they 're in the system . Names ? Elliot and andre demar , d-e-m-a-r . - I 'll see what I can do . - Okay , thanks . How 's everything going over there ? It 's a rat 's nest . A thousand notebooks , some long numbers scribbled on the blackboard . - " 3185296 ... " - The amelia sequence . Amelia ? It 's a theory that teller was working on . Look , just keep digging . We 'll get over there as soon as we can . Thanks . You think they 're , like , communicating ? I don 't know . Elliot , take a seat . Please ? Come on . I need to know where your parents are . Look , I understand what 's going on here . You 're on your own . You 're taking care of your brother . You have to do what you have to do to survive . But if I don 't ... You know what happens if they find out about me and andre ? He gets sent to some hellhole upstate , and I get bounced around from one group home to the next . I know what it 's like to have someone you love taken away from you , trust me , and I don 't want that to happen to you . But jake led me to you for a reason . I 'm gonna find out the truth one way or another . I 'd just rather hear it from you , man-to-man . did teller ever talk to you about the amelia sequence ? Well , he may have mentioned her once or twice . her ? Are we talking about a sequence of numbers or a girl named amelia ? Look , arthur teller died under questionable circumstances . I 'm only here to try and piece together what really happened . If you could shed any light on his life , his work , I would really appreciate it . My dad , he 'd always kind of come and go , especially after my mom died . But that was , like , a lot of years ago . What about andre ? He got shot about a year back . Brain damage . Things got pretty rough . My dad , he always counted on andre to do the shopping . He was a good big brother . A couple months after andre went down , dad took off . I mean , I heard he was in florida maybe , but that 's just talk . You don 't have any other family ? My mom wasn 't from this country , and my dad never really talked about his people , so ... Elliot , you 're 13 years old . You can 't do this on your own . It 's not fair to you . It 's not fair to your brother . Oh , so you got all the answers ? Why don 't you worry about fixing you 're own kid , all right ? 'cause I got my brother . Jake ... What is it ? No way . check it . He wrote " hungry . " You hungry , andre ? No sweat , my man . I fix you something right now . Look at that . My boy 's learning to talk . Teller worked with her for years . Intensive research on his number theories . Poor girl . It didn 't end well . - This is amelia ? - You know her ? She was in the board-and-care facility where I work . I saw her on security footage the day teller died . The people that he worked with , they pushed for results . He succumbed to their pressure ; increased the intensity of his experiments . Worked amelia harder . And then something went wrong . She was damaged . Her brain . Teller was discredited ; he lost his tenure.It sent him into a profound depression . He blamed himself for what happened . Sounds like you knew him pretty well . Arthur teller was my best friend . You know , it 's almost like he 's talking again . Yeah . He picked it up really quickly . - So , jake ... ? - No , not a word . Maybe he just doesn 't want to talk . Maybe you got to be all right with that . What ? Maybe you gotta be okay with jake not wanting to talk . you guys gotta go . Now . What just happened ? Why do we have to go ? 'cause you just do . I ... I got something I need to do . Elliot , look , I know you 're in some kind of trouble , and I know it has to do with a gun . Just talk to me ; tell me what it is . I can help you . If you want to help me , then give me that gun . And if that isn 't gonna happen , hey ! i 'm gonna ask you to get out . Fine . We 'll go . Jake ... Something is really wrong here . I think we need to stay and make sure elliot 's safe . hey * * * * * * * * * * did * * * * * * * * * * she * * * * * * * * * * * * * so * * * * * * * * * i was * * * * * * * * * * i have * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i 've * * * * * * * * * yarah * * * * * * * * * * * * she is * * * * * * * * * * the * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ai . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lightning * * * * * * * * * * * * * * you * * * * * * * * * * * * come * * * * * * * * * * this * * * * * * * * * * * * * * diamonds . i have * * * * * * * * * * * * he sells * * * * * * * * * * * * a * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * no * * * * * * * * * * wait . you * * * * * * * * * * * * a * * * that * * * * * * * * * yes * * * * * * * * i will * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and * * * * * * * * * * * aiberto . * * * * * * * * * * * * sorry ? Sorry doesn 't cut it , elliot . Sorry does not fix this . Now , you listen to me : I want you back there- - today ! Do you understand me ? Today . Don 't screw it up this time . jake , you stay right here . elliot ... What was that ? Please talk to me . I want to help you , but I need to know what 's going on . Nobody can help me . Elliot ... i 'm so sorry we 're late . Look , I 'll explain everything later , but for now , did you find anything out about the boys ? Yeah , I made a few calls . family services did look into elliot and andre demar , four years ago , after their mother died . They located one relative , and aunt on the mother 's side , but custody went to the father , so I don 't think she was ever contacted . Do you have a number ? Thanks . My name is martin bohm . I need to talk to you . It 's regarding your nephews , elliot and andre . They 're in new york and they need you , please . It 's extremely urgent . Get back to me as soon as you can . Thank you . who 's that ? Mystery room , mystery man . His name is avram . Says he was teller 's best friend . I understand you knew arthur teller . I 'm martin bohm . So this is the boy . One of the 36 . Excuse me ? Are you saying that there are 35 others like jake ? Kabbala calls them lamed vav tzadikim ... The 36 righteous ones . God will allow humankind to exist as long as there are 36 righteous people in the world . excuse me . These hidden 36 , no one knows who they are . But they walk among us , blessed with the capacity to feel the suffering of the entire human race . And they work to alleviate that suffering , to make small changes to the spinning of the earth , to repair the universe , if you will . Tikkun olam . Do you think jake is one of these 36 ? yes . Unless he 's not . Who knows ? Might just be hooey , some words written in an old book . Elliot demar 's on probation . A shoplifting charge from six months ago . His probation officer 's up by fordham road . Here 's the address . " 42155 ... " Four-two ... 42155- - why is that so familiar ? Four-two-one-five ... It 's backwards . 55124 are the numbers that jake punches into his tablet to create his melody . please * * * * * * * * * * * i * * * * * * * * * * * * * the * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * is * * * * * * i 'm * * * * * * * * * * do you * * * * * * * * * * * * the * * * * * * * * * * * * all * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i * * * * * * * * * * i 'm * * * * * * * * yarah . we 'll * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - we . - yes what * * * * * * * * * * * * * * there * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i am * * * * * * * * * * * why * * * * because * * * * * * * * * * * you * * * * * * * * * * * * * * you * * * * * * * * * but * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i have * * * * * * * * * * * * understand ? - officer tenney ? - Yeah . I 'm martin bohm . I wanted to talk to you about one of your probationers , elliot demar . How do you know elliot ? I 'm ... I 'm his basketball coach , over at the y . Look , I 'm-i 'm just concerned that- - I don 't see any adults involved in his life . They certainly don 't show up at any of the games . I 'm sorry . Why don 't you have a seat , mr.Bohm ? Thank you . Well , it 's a difficult situation . I mean , I know elliot 's father 's not around much . I just hope that , uh , he keeps a clean record and doesn 't get sent away . That 'd be a real tragedy . He 's a good kid and ... He 's just had a lot of tough breaks . I think something else is going on here . I-I think someone 's threatening him or harassing him . Someone in a position of power . Harass ? Do you have any idea by whom ? No . I was hoping you would . But I 'll tell you something ¡ ªIf I find out who 's doing this , i 'm not gonna let him get away with it . i 'd just be careful . One thing you learn , as a probation officer , is discretion . I think the last thing you want to do here is expose something and inadvertently make things worse than they already are . Meaning what exactly ? Well ... Like I said ... Elliot 's in a very difficult situation right now . just a sec ... I 'm sorry . I have to take this . Of course . Can I have one of these ? In case I need to find you later ? Thank you very much for your time . you were in the alley by the gun . My son led me to you . Let me call you back . - Do I know you ? - No ... Look , I 'm sorry , but ... What is your connection to elliot demar ? I 'm sorry , man . I 'm just here to see my probation officer . Let me guess- - John tenney ? Look , I know tenney 's corrupt . I 'm not trying to create problems for you . I 'm just trying to expose a bad probation officer . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I think tenney 's forcing a child ¡ ª One of his probationers ¡ ª To commit crimes . A 13-year-old boy who has his whole life in front of him . A kid that was just unlucky enough to have his mother pass away and his father run out on him . He deserves a better life than this . He deserves a chance . Please . This is unfair . He 's a good kid . Hey . I told tenney about the music shop on the second floor of the building where I work . The lady who owns the place keeps the cash from her sales in a red leather pouch in her desk . And he sent elliot to rob the place . Cash piles up , and then , once a month , she puts the pouch in her purse , she takes it to the bank . It 's always the same day of the month , always right at 4 : 30 . And today 's that day . He didn 't get it this morning , so he 's making elliot try again . - Thank you . - yeah . hey * * * * * * * * * * * hey , you * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i * * * * * * * * * * what ? how much ? what * * * * * * * * * * * * i 'm * * * * * * * * * * * is * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * interested * * * * * * * * * * * * * oh * * * * * music * * * * * * * * * * * what * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * a * * * * * * * * * * * a man . in * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * see . a * * * * * * * * * * * * they * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * well * * * * * * * * * * * at * * * * * * * * * * no . Elliot ! officer , he just took my bag ! elliot . What have you done ? Hello ? Hope I 'm not catching you at a bad time . Sheri , hi . I just wondered if you might know where jake and Mr. Bohm are . Is there a problem ? No , it 's just getting late , and I wanted to make sure jake was back for dinner . Have you tried calling Mr. Bohm directly ? I didn 't want to bother him . I know how special these outings are for the two of them . I 'm ... A bit confused here . What makes you think I would know where they are ? I just thought you might have seen them- - that 's all . I didn 't mean to be presumptuous . Good-bye , sheri . thank you , young man . Helpful , this one , huh ? That 's right . Just put them all on the black cloth right here . Very good . - What is it ? - There 's one missing . Good eyes , my boy . He never touches anyone . 9500 * * * * * * * three * * * * * * * * * * * that * * * * * * * * * together * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * felipe * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i * * * * * * * * * * are you * * * * * giving * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the * * * * * * * * * * and * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this * * * * * * * * * * i 'm * * * * * * * * * * * * * * go * * * * * * * * * * * * * * run * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * go * * * * listen * * * * * * * * * * i will * * * * * * * * * * * yarah . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * do * * * * * * * * * * * * no but * * * * * * * hi .

This is to help you out with your brother , all right ? Thanks . Anything else ? I looked in the alley some more , and ... I found it . What are you doing bringing this to me here ? How dumb is that , elliot ? Walking into a probation office with a gun ? Come on . You got to think . Get out of here . - John tenney , please stand . - It 's all right . It 's all right . - what 's this all about ? step away from the desk . - It 's all right . He can 't hurt you anymore . the earth , as it rotates , emits a frequency , a musical note , at 7.83 hertz . But this frequency alters slightly for reasons as yet uncertain . Some postulate solar flares as the cause , or electrical disturbance in the atmosphere . But maybe there 's a simpler explanation . Maybe the sound of the planet is influenced by the seven billion souls whirring around it , each producing their own music , adding their own harmony . - Did you have fun ? - Yeah . - He 's not using his tablet ? - no . As a matter of fact , he gave it away . How did you let that happen ? That device can help teach jake to talk . Maybe he doesn 't want to talk . Maybe it 's my job as his father ... to just be all right with that . Touch Season 01 Episode 09

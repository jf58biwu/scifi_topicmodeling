 I wanna be sure , father , that this is the right thing to do . Yes . It 's time to fight . Fifth Column is proving to be a bigger threat than anticipated . We have just the weapon to fight them ... Ryan Nichols . - What makes you think you can control him ? - We have his child . She 's sick , Ryan . I can ease her suffering . - All you have to do is join us again . - Okay . Thank you , Agent Malik . The queen will be pleased . I think that FBI Agent , Erica Evans , is in danger . You 're out of options here . Come on . Come on . Come on ! No ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Uhh ! Aah ! Uhh ! Aah ! Aah ! - Jack ? - Erica ! Erica . Are you okay ? Yeah . How did you find me ? I knew you were tracking our leads on the suicide bomber . We saw the wreckage from the road . Look at me . Look at me . Okay . What happened ? Malik 's a visitor . - I 'll be damned . - Yeah . Let me help you . Okay . Uhh . Yeah . You okay ? I 'm fine . No ! Do not kill her ! Keep her alive . We need answers . Anything and everything she knows about Anna 's plans . Take her back to your place . I 'll meet you there . Wait , Erica . What about you , huh ? I gotta call this in . Aah ! What are you doing ? Giving you a cover story . Get her into the truck . Go ! Don 't be alarmed , Lisa . Mother , what 's happening to me ? Your body is preparing you for your birthright ... to be queen . M - my skin ... it 's moving . It 's your breeding skin . It 's begun to grow . Over the next few months , as it forms , you 'll become fertile . You 'll undergo many changes ... Changes that will permit our race to endure . What kind of changes ? The emergence of your true nature ... your primal instinct . It happened to me , and my mother helped me through it . And before she died , I promised her that I would mold you into a great leader . How will I know if I 'm ready ? I 'll teach you to lead in my own image . You 'll become just like me . Lisa 's breeding skin has begun to grow . Everything 's right on schedule . So you 've come to gloat . Her fertility will ensure our survival . And yet you 're concerned . What would I have to be concerned about ? The warning I gave you about Lisa 's betrayal . I can see it on your face , working on you . Suspicion . Remember when your breeding skin began to grow ... That 's when you first betrayed me . You were weak . I did what I had to do to protect our species . So will Lisa , if you 're not careful . No . Because I 'll do for her what you never did for me ... Teach her to rule . Prepare her for what 's to come . In the meantime , daughter , watch your back . As I had to learn the hard way , the more you think you 're helping your child , the more you push them away . It 's wide open ! And you got nothing on the guys who did this ? I told you , Paul . It was dark . They were wearing masks . They pulled up next to us . They shot out the tires . The next thing I knew I was upside-down . It 's a miracle you survived . I 'm surprised those Fifth Column nut jobs didn 't kill you . Well , they took Malik , - and I need to find her . We were headed for that lead ... - Dead end . We already checked the farmhouse , there 's no lead to the bombers . Go home . You 're off the case . - Paul ? - Evans , it 's standard operating procedure , and you know it . Don 't worry . I 'll find Malik . I just received a report that Agent Malik has been abducted . The FBI suspects the Fifth Column . They 've begun an investigation into her disappearance . The true nature of the work that she was doing for us must not be exposed . Take some trackers and retrieve any evidence she may have left behind . What about the Fifth Column ... And finding those who took her ? I have it under control . Look , Ryan . Your daughter 's not in pain anymore . You did it on purpose , didn 't you ? You made her sick to force me to help you . Of course not . I helped her and will continue to , as I promised . So now you want me to do my part . - What do you want ? - One of my children has gone missing ... Sarita Malik . She was co-head of the FBI anti-V terrorism unit . We believe the Fifth Column took her . I want you to find her and identify those responsible . - It 'll take time . - Bring me names by tonight . My bliss will wear off by then . I know you don 't want to see your daughter suffer , Ryan . Neither do I. What are you really saying , Sid ? Normal D.N.A. looks like this ... - Okay . - And Tyler 's D.N.A ... Looks like this . Half the ladder 's been stripped . - How can he survive like this ? - I don 't know , but he 's made it this far without symptoms or side effects . But a missing piece ? What does that mean ? The V 's wanted that space to be empty . For what ? Why empty anything out ? To put something else in . Oh , God . They messed with my son . They corrupted Tyler 's DNA . What ? How do you know ? Sid confirmed it . They must have done it when I was pregnant . Yeah , but wouldn 't Tyler have shown some signs , symptoms ? I mean , how 's something like this even possible ? Of course it 's not possible . Neither are giant spaceships . - Why would they do this ? - That 's what we need to find out . I can take samples from Ryan , but ... Without D.N.A. Comparisons from a female V 's reproductive system , we 'll still only have half the picture - of what they could be planning for Tyler . - I wouldn 't do that . She has fangs . And a tail , too . Females can just rip it out whenever they have to . We were following the lead on Eli Cohn . Malik decided to show me her true self . We still gonna hit that farm up in Ossining ? If radical Fifth Column were there , they are long gone by now . You 're a traitor . Anna will make you pay for turning against her . What do you say , Erica ? Time to get some answers ? Hold on , man . You need to understand something , okay ? Visitors have a high threshold for pain . Now you want to torture her into talking ? There 's really only one way ... It 's to skin her . The problem is , you won 't have much time . Skinning her is gonna kill her . She 'll live maybe a half hour , tops . That 's enough time . I only need one answer ... What they did to my son . I know you want to find out about Tyler , Erica . But what makes you think she knows ? My first partner , now Malik . Two V partners can 't be a coincidence . They got close to me to get close to Tyler . Okay . Wait a minute . Now hold up . You told me yourself that Malik was in the bureau long before you guys were partners . Meaning what ? Meaning that her original assignment probably had nothing to do with you or your son . So let 's find out what she 's been doing here all this time . My mom was attacked by Fifth Column . I keep trying to help her , but she won 't let me . She 's an FBI agent , Tyler . I 'm sure she can protect herself . I keep trying to warn her about this priest , Jack Landry , but she won 't listen to me . Well , I 'm listening . Tell me ... Why do you think this priest is a threat ? Because he might be connected to the Fifth Column . His anti-V sermons are all over the net . The suicide bomber who blew up the healing centers went to his parish . I think you need to approach this differently , Tyler . You need to help your mother if she won 't help herself . Hey , guys . Check this out . Looks like we 're not the only ones interested in Malik . Yeah , I put a lipstick camera in the tree . Trackers . They 're trying to pick up on Malik 's scent . Marcus is with them . Whatever Malik was working on , it 's important to Anna , and that makes it important to us . Where does she live ? Her apartment ? Kendrick 's sent agents by now . - Trust me , they didn 't find anything . - How do you know ? Because they wouldn 't know where or how to look . Aah ! Let 's go . Nice place Malik 's got . Lots of security . Always gotta know who 's knocking on your door . - What are we looking for ? - Safe box . Every sleeper has one . Hey . Ryan , check it out . This number 's been used more than the other ones . This could be it . Huh . I wondered what that was for . Contingency cash . Look at all this . Law enforcement I.D. Great Britain . We 've got Canada . We have Pakistan . V tech . This could come in handy . What does this have to do with her assignment ? This could tell us . Who are all those people ? These dates go for back years , way before Malik was working with you . Okay . We 'll run the names through the bureau database when we get back . Maybe we 'll find something that will help us figure out what Malik was doing . Hey . We 've got visitors . Foil . I need some tinfoil . We 've gotta erase our scent . All right . Come on . Let 's do it . Thank you for coming , Chad . I 'm sorry it 's been so long since we 've spoken . - I 've been busy . - I know . I heard about your close call with the Fifth Column suicide bomber . Mm-hmm . Luckily , Agent Evans was there to stop her . So ... what can I do for you , Anna ? Well , as you 've experienced firsthand , despite general goodwill on the part of mankind , a few small pockets of hostility still remain . Mm-hmm , residual skepticism from the whole red sky affair . You played God . That didn 't sit well with some people , particularly people of faith . Well , that 's why I called you here . I need your help . Do you know anything about this man ? Not much . The guy who hit the healing center was one of his parishioners . The police interviewed him , determined that he wasn 't involved . He 's local . Not much of a profile otherwise . Perhaps that should change . I 'd like for you to provide a forum for his voice to be heard . You want me to interview this guy ? Millions of people watch my show . Why would you ... Give a fringe voice that kind of exposure ? I believe every voice , no matter how small , deserves to have a forum . Every point of view should be presented . Isn 't that the basis of good journalism ? You 're making a mistake . She singled you out , so we know she 's got an ulterior motive . You can control the interview . You can edit it , protect me . Well , not if she 's got a bull 's-eye on you , I can 't . Like you said , she already does . This interview will raise my profile . The bigger I get , the harder a target I become . I 'm not afraid of her , Chad . You should be . I 'm gonna take the risk . Are you with me or not ? Whatever Malik 's assignment was , we 'll find it in here . These people ... they all fell off the grid . There 's no financial activity , there 's no utilities , no current address . Are they homeless ? Runaways ? People Anna can make disappear , and no one will notice . So wait . Anna 's doing alien abductions ? As in ... Yeah , so if she 's abducting people here , she 's doing it everywhere , all over the world . The only way that we can stop Anna is to get a step ahead of her . We need to figure out her plan . This is the key to eliminating the greatest threat to the survival of our species ... the human soul . How is the human soul a threat ? It exerts a powerful influence over humans . If we don 't eliminate it , our plans will fail . There are some commonly held notions among humans the soul is eternal . After death , it leaves the body . This machine is engineered to locate and extract it . I 'm ready to begin trial runs . However , as test subjects will not survive the process , we 'll need more than we 've ever needed before ... hundreds of thousands . How are you progressing ? Fortunately , despite Agent Malik 's disappearance , it appears our test subjects will still arrive on schedule . Good . Hi . Aah ! You okay ? I think that deep down that I wanted Malik 's assignment to be Tyler , finally get some answers . If Malik won 't give us answers , maybe her body will . With science boy on the case ... That 'd be science man . Hey , guys . Let me show you this . See , these dates in here ... They 're dated in the past , right ? Except for this one . Sophie Allen . It 's dated today . Maybe those are the dates they were taken . Then she 's next in line . If we can find Sophie , then we can stop this . We can keep Anna from taking anyone else . Who are those people ? What do you want with Sophie Allen ? How many more of them are there ? More than you can imagine . There 's a work address in here for her mother . Let 's go . To be continued . Hey , father . Your interview will make tonight 's news . I came by to see if you wanted to watch it , but ... No , it 's okay , Chad . Why don 't you stay for the service ? I want to address the violence of the last few days that shed the blood of innocent people at the healing center . As many of you know , I 've spoken out against the visitors , declaring them false gods , calling them intruders . And while I stand by these claims , we must never forget what defines us . My wife ... Was killed in the suicide bombing yesterday . It wasn 't the V 's who killed her . It was their enemy . People like you . No ... - I am so sorry for your loss . - Yeah ? What does that get me ? No amount of talk is gonna bring my wife back ... Or their loved ones . Come on , stand up , please . This isn 't the time for this or the place ! Please , show some respect . Respect ? ! People are dead because of this jerk ! Hey ! Hey ! No ! No , no , no ! No , wait ! No ! No ! No , no , no ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Uhh ! Aah ! No ! No ! No ! Break it up ! Come on ! Stop ! Come on ! Stop ! Uhh ! I understand your anger . Believe me , I do . - No , you don 't ! - Yes , I do ! I 'm the one with your wife 's blood on my hands , not them . You wanna blame someone , you blame me . You wanna fight ? You fight me . Ma 'am ? Betty Allen ? FBI . Am I in some kind of trouble ? Actually , we 're worried your daughter might be . I 'm here unofficially , as a mother . You 're here about Sophie ? Yeah , I have a friend who works with teens at a counseling center . Sophie was a regular there , but she 's missed her last few appointments . I 'm not sure how I can help you . Sophie ran away from here six months ago . I haven 't seen her since . Do you have any leads ? Any , um , addresses ? Friends ? Uh , phone numbers ? She got caught up with some older kids . They weren 't the best influence . I tried to talk to her , but ... You misstep and you misstep , and ... You realize you 're losing them , but ... It 's too late . You 've lost them already . I have a teenager . I feel that way sometimes , too . If you think of anything that might help us find her , please ... Call me . Thanks . Wait . You 're the first people to come and ask about her . And I 've tried everything to find her , and the police can 't help me because she 's over 18 . You 're a mother . You understand . You ? Do you have any children ? A daughter . Then you know how I feel . Help me . Please . Thank you , Betty . Any luck with Sophie 's mom ? Malik is the only one with answers . Then let 's get ' em . Wait . You said skinning her will kill her . I still need her as a test subject . So we 'll serve her up , carved up on a platter . No , I need her alive ! These tissue samples I 've taken , - they 're degrading incredibly fast . - It 's a defense mechanism . If we 're taken or killed , we can 't be studied . I need more time . If she dies , any insight her body can give us about the visitors , or Tyler , will die with her . It 's your son . It 's gotta be your call . I saw your interview . Fine work . I 'm not sure it 'll have the effect you hoped for . It 'll have the exact effect I hoped for . I wanted the world to pay attention to him so they would pay attention to this ... So despite your opposition to the V 's , you don 't condone this recent rash of violence against them ? Correct . I 'm not a proponent of violence of any kind against anyone , and certainly not against my fellow man . No ! Stop ! You wanna fight ? You fight me . Hold on . That 's ... That 's only half the story . I was there . Jack Landry calmed that crowd down . Unfortunately , that 's not what the rest of the world is gonna see on your Internet . A duplicitous priest committing violence in a house of worship . This sort of story seems to spread rapidly . Well done , Chad . You helped expose a man who will be brought down by this violent truth . If Sophie is still out there , she 's our best chance for stopping these abductions . Erica , nobody would judge you if you picked Tyler . How can I put my kid 's life before so many others ? Sometimes you just ... Just gotta protect your own . One last time . Where 's Sophie ? Skin her . I know what you 're thinking , that you can stay strong , die before you tell us what we want to know . Hobbes . There 's two options here , luv . Epinephrine . This 'll keep you alive . Another ten or so hours of good , hard fun . Or option number two ... a sedative . This 'll put you right to beddy-bye , let you die peacefully . But personally , I vote ... to keep you alive . How can you do this to one of your own ? He may be a visitor , but he is nothing like you . I promise you this ... You will never find that girl . Answers . Ryan ... That 's enough . Answers . Aah ! Answers now . We can end this . Ed Cantrill . He poses as a driver for the Midnight Samaritan , delivering food to the homeless . That 's how he finds his victims ? Where ? New Jersey . Lonergan Farm . A shuttle ... When ? You ... you saw the date . T - tonight . My son Tyler ? What do you know about Anna 's plans for him ? Nothing . I don 't know anything else . I ... I swear to you . Give her the sedative . Ryan , it 's the van . No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Freeze ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! I got it . Uhh ! - Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! - Don 't ! Help me . Sophie ? Help me . Sophie . What 's happening ? It 's over . Hey , sweetheart , you 're gonna be okay . She 's been drugged . It 's a fail-safe in case she escaped . - She won 't remember a thing . - Sophie . We 're gonna take you home . There could be more out there . Take her to the car . Hey . There you go . No . We 're still missing people . No ! No , no , no ! There 's nothing we can do now . How 's my daughter doing ? Are you instructing her as a directed ? She 's proven to be a quick learner . We 're ready to test our first subject . Even when it makes no sense to fight , they do . Joshua . Water , muscle , bone , tissue . Each will be removed from the corpus ... taking the subject to the brink of death . What remains , the last substance in his dying breath , that should be the soul . Joshua , stop . Is something wrong ? No . Good . It is only one life , nothing compared to the future of our species . You must learn that in order to be queen . Continue the experiment . No , not you , Joshua . Lisa . Please . Don 't . Help me . Please . Look into his eyes . Look into his soul . Now take it . Please . Don 't . Aah ! Uhh ! Aah ! Oh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! You 're gonna be okay , Sophie . You 're very brave . You guys ... What happened to me ? I can 't remember anything . You were abducted , and now you 're safe . That is all that you need to know . The rest of it is just a bad dream . We promised your mother we 'd bring you home . Yeah . Okay . Betty ? Oh ! Feels good , doesn 't it ? We only saved one . To that mother , one is everything . This is what we 're fighting for , to keep our children safe . We have to savor these wins . I wish I could . Ryan ... We 're gonna get your daughter back . I know . Good , 'cause if we lose hope , we lose this fight . Stop ! You wanna fight ? You fight me . Yeah , it 's gone viral . Anna had me build you up so she could tear you down . I knew Anna would try and manipulate my interview somehow , but this ... The guy who started the fight ... I saw his eyes . He wasn 't human . Anna must 've planted him there . I never told you it was gonna be easy . Look , maybe I can put out another piece , show people the truth about what happened . No , they 've already seen what she wanted them to see . It 's okay , Chad . I 'll weather this storm . You 're on Anna 's radar . That is not an easy storm to weather . Believe me , father . I 've been there . Maybe not , but I choose to have faith . It 's all I can rely on now . You 're a brave man , father . So are you . And despite what 's happened today , you have to stay close to Anna . That 's your role in this fight . Even if it costs you yours ? What happens then ? The Fifth Column will hold strong , as long as we have men like you fighting with us . It 's time you met the others . It 's good to see you again , Agent Evans . How 's the Fifth Column task force ? My day job . Call me Erica . Thank you for the tip on Malik . That was a very gutsy thing , sticking your neck out like that . It was the least I could do . You saved my ass yesterday from that suicide bomber . I don 't know . I don 't like this . He 's burned us before . - Give him a chance , Hobbes . - No , he 's right . I have burned you . But I 'm here to make amends . Use me . My position with Anna . I know her better than anyone . I can help . Anna only tells you what she wants you to know . You know no idea what she 's capable of . Or who she really is . - Oh , my God . - This is what they look like . Anna ... Looks like this underneath ? Well , what ... What do they ... want ? Why don 't they just kill everybody and take over ? Because they want us . Chad , you sure you 're ready for this ? You did a wonderful thing today , capturing that footage on your cell phone . I 'm glad you told me to go . Now the world 's gonna see what a threat the Jack Landrys are , and more people like you will help us . That 's all that I want . I know . So does Lisa . You 'll continue to watch out for us . I will . Good . Please be careful . You 're not just a friend , Tyler . You 're like a son to me . Lisa ? Come in . What 's the matter ? What happened ? Lisa . Talk to me . I can 't do this . I 'm not like you . I 'm a visitor . Okay , you listen to me . It 's gonna be all right , okay ? Whatever it is , just tell me . Talk to me . My mother ... She 's trying to change me . She can 't change what 's inside you . I don 't have anyone to talk to . Yes , you do . Lisa , you have me . Hey . It 's okay . Shh , shh , shh . I proved you wrong today , mother . I tested Lisa . She passed . As you passed all my tests ? Watch her ... Carefully . I 'm watching her every move . I tried to make you like me once , too , but you and I were always quite different . Caution was not ... has never been ... your nature . Caution may not be my strong suit , but foresight is . Good . You 're going to need it . She 's so peaceful when I give her bliss , isn 't she ? So ... what did you discover today ? I found the Fifth Column . I know who took Malik .

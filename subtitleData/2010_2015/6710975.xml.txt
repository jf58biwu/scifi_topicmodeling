They seek to respond after earthquakes last night of magnitude 3.5 with its epicenter in the center of the Angels . There were no reports of significant damage , but this third tremor in as many weeks It has caused some Angelenos start asking questions . Publicly , the USGS called for calm , but our source on the Service Geological Survey says that in private , fear that it may be linked the surge in earthquakes seen worldwide , especially in Afghanistan , Indonesia , Japan and Chile . The governments of these countries appeared unable to explain , but also they called for calm . The messages found make us wonder , It is the same old thing or the beginning of something much bigger ? Many here in Los Angeles accept the tremors .

Why didn 't you tell me my mother was still alive ? I thought ... it would only give you false hope ... and put you in grave danger . I didn 't want to fail you as I failed her . How did you fail her ? By allowing ilaria to take her , to use her against me . That 's why you created the Narvik for ilaria ? To keep her alive ? I had no other choice .

No , Alan needs to know that Daniel took the canisters . You have the cure . What does that matter ? He took both canisters , virus and cure . I don 't have to explain to you what that means if it gets out . Ahem . What 's wrong ? Are you sick ? No , I 'm fine . You 're white . With everything that happened , you need a blood test .

All right ? Ha-ha-ha . I mean , what is this ? Good scientist , bad scientist ? Here 's how this will work . You will contact your cohort and arrange to have Julia 's mother returned to us . And only then will we let you go . Total surrender ? Yeah , see , that is quite tempting , but let me give you the full view . You 've already lost . We have the virus and we have the cure .

I thought the Scythe only worked on the down-low . He 's indisposed at the moment , courtesy of Hatake and your friends from the CDC . He 's a prisoner ? He 's exactly where he wants to be . Virus and cure . You 've got the Narvik virus and cure right here ? Only thing left to do is close out . The camera 's off-line . That ought to keep them from listening in . This is unspeakable . Are you sure it wasn 't an accident ? No , that was a test run . Lares is isolated . It 's the perfect sample size to see how the virus behaves in a given population . There are no reports of vectors , so it must be Narvik-A . I know a little bit about this , okay ? Peter 's right . Which means we can contain it . But only if we are able to retrieve the cure . And my mother . Yes , along with Jane . Well , we know they 're watching us . Where 's the best place to hack into the camera ? The security room on Level G. They must have set up a base of operations . There is only one entrance . If we access the subfloor , I might be able to recalibrate the air filtration system and flood the room with CS gas . Or we could use our chips to gain access and go in armed . I like that idea . I 'm in . No , no . We need somebody to watch after the teenager . Great . Babysitting duty .

I am not proud . But surely you , of all people , can understand that . I know all about sacrifices . I 've sacrificed nearly every relationship I ever had to science . But human experimentation ? On children , no less ? I 'm not that man anymore . BALLESEROS : Then prove it . Give me the list and I give you the canisters . There is no list . I 'm sorry . That is bullshit . No written list .

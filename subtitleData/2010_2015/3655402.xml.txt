( siren wailing ) ( sobbing ) I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A MAN I KNOW- - A WINDOW WASHER IN LOS ANGELES . NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM- - JUST GOING ABOUT HIS LIFE , LIVING FROM DAY TO DAY . HOOK ME UP . VAGUE PLANS . FEW DREAMS . AND IF HE HAD ANY ASPIRATIONS , HE NEVER SPOKE OF THEM . ( horns honking ) LIKE MOST OF US , HE WAS ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS WHEN THE BLACKOUT HIT . ( clank ) ( machinery whirring ) ( tires screeching , loud crashing ) BEFORE THE BLACKOUT , THE WINDOW WASHER LIVED HIS LIFE IGNORING THE QUESTIONS OF THE FUTURE . THEY JUST WEREN 'T THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM , SO HE BELIEVED NOTHING . BUT THE BLACKOUT CAME ... AND THIS MAN FACED CERTAIN DEATH . ( loud explosion in distance ) ( airplane engine roars , car alarms wail ) ( tires screech ) MANY OF US THINK THAT WHEN DIVINE INTERVENTION HAPPENS , IT 'S SOMETHING BIG . BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A SMALL THING ... ( clank ) THAT SEEMS SO INCONSEQUENTIAL IN THE MOMENT , THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE TURNING POINT FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE . ( clank ) ( scaffolding creaks ) ( helicopter whirring ) BIG OR SMALL , WHAT IF THAT MOMENT AFFECTED EVERYONE , EVERYWHERE AT THE EXACT SAME TIME ? WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO YOU ? WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK FOR ANSWERS ? THE ANSWER IS NEVER ABOUT JUST ONE PERSON . EVERY SINGLE PERSON 'S LIFE WAS TOUCHED BY THE BLACKOUT . NONE OF US ARE IN THIS ALONE .

THAT 'S NOT ENOUGH TRAUMA FOR YOU ? I 'VE SEEN YOUR FILES . YOU 'VE GOT A GOD COMPLEX .

EH , WELL , THIS ISN 'T A GOOD TIME . I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH LLOYD SIMCOE . Have you been drinking ? GO TO HELL , LLOYD . I TOLD HIM I-I DIDN 'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM . Look , you have every right to hate me , but- - LISTEN , I DON 'T HATE YOU . I JUST WISH YOU WERE STANDING BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL WHEN I CAME CRASHING THROUGH . Fine , but we need to talk about the Q.E.D. SOUNDED LIKE WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER . LISTENI 'm not sure.E YOU . It 's highly theoretical , ANDING but I 'm--I 'm close to cracking it . LISTEN TO ME . CLOSE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH . D. GIBBONS TOLD ME ABOUT- - The man you call D. Gibbons lied to you . YOU NEED TO HURRY . WE 'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME . UNLESS WE CAN STOP THIS ... AND THEN I TOLD HIM ... THERE 'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT . ( Wedeck ) ARE YOU SURE ? I 'M POSITIVE . THERE 'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT . IF SIMCOE SAW THE SAME THING YOU DID , WHY 'S HE BEEN SITTING ON THIS INFORMATION THE WHOLE TIME ? WHY HASN 'T HE COME FORWARD ? I DON 'T KNOW . LET 'S FIND HIM AND ASK HIM .

WORK THEM ... ( lowers voice ) BUT BE QUIET ABOUT IT . ALL RIGHT . THIS BUSINESS ABOUT ANOTHER BLACKOUT ... KEEP IT TO YOURSELF . IF WE CAN 'T TELL THE WORLD WHEN IT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN , THAT 'S BEYOND IRRESPONSIBLE . THIS IS THE NUMBER FOR ONE OF OUR MISSING E.M.T.s. WE 'RE HOPING THE PHONE MIGHT STILL BE IN THE AMBULANCE . CAN YOU TRACK IT FOR US ? YEAH . IF THE BATTERY 'S STILL GOT JUICE , I CAN CAPTURE THE SIGNAL AND TRIANGULATE ITS POSITION . HOW CLOSE CAN YOU GET US ? TO WITHIN 50 METERS IF IT 'S IN THE CITY . GREAT . LET 'S DO IT . ( typing ) I MADE IT FOR YOU , DADDY , TO CHEER YOU UP . WELL , IT WORKED . THANK YOU . IT 'S BEAUTIFUL , CHARLIE . WHAT 'S ALL THIS ? IT 'S A GIANT PUZZLE , SOMETHING I STILL HAVEN 'T FIGURED OUT YET . WHEN I DO JIGSAW PUZZLES AT NANA 'S HOUSE , I ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY WHEN SHE DUMPS THE PIECES OUT ON THE TABLE . YEAH ? MM-HMM . BUT WE ALWAYS START WITH THE CORNERS AND WORK IN . AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE . START WITH THE CORRS . COME HERE . ( chuckles ) SOMETIMES WE FEEL GOD 'S HAND ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK PUSHING US TOWARDS SOMETHING . AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL TOTALLY ABANDONED . THAT 'S NORMAL . BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON 'T FEEL SOMETHING DOESN 'T MEAN IT 'S NOT THERE . HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE GOTTEN SUNBURNED ON A CLOUDY DAY ? YOU DIDN 'T THINK IT WAS WORKING ON YOU , BUT IT WAS . GOD 'S LOVE IS JUST LIKE THAT- - WORKING FOR YOUR GOOD , WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF IT OR NOT . HERE YOU GO . THANK YOU . SORRY . I JUST HAD A QUESTION . SURE . WHAT ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE GOD ? DON 'T WE OWE HIM SOMETHING ? LIKE WHAT ? OBEDIENCE ? I MEAN , WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT HE SETS OUT . AND IF WE DON 'T ? WE GET PUNISHED . I-I JUST DON 'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY THAT THE BLACKOUT WAS GOOD . AND LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIED . LOOK AT ALL THE TROUBLE IT 'S CAUSING . WOW . CLEARLY , I 'VE UPSET YOU . WELL , DON 'T YOU THINK- - IN THE VERY LEAST , THE FLASH-FORWARDS WERE A WAKE-UP CALL FOR US TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER BEFORE IT 'S TOO LATE ? I DIDN 'T CATCH YOUR NAME . NICOLE . MY NAME IS TIMOTHY . I 'D REALLY LIKE TO KEEP TALKING WITH YOU , BUT IF I DON 'T GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE MY HOUR 'S UP , I GET CHARGED . WE , THANKS . THERE 'S A COFFEE SHOP I LIKE NEARBY . IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN LATER ... RED PANDA PROVIDES HUMANITARIAN AID ALL AROUND THE WORLD- - EVERYTHING FROM MICRO-INVESTMENTS TO EDUCATION . WE 'VE BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY SINCE THE BLACKOUT . I 'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE . YOU SAID YOU DO WORK ALL OVER THE WORLD . YES . WE GREW OUT OF D.H.S. IN THE ' 90s- - YOU KNOW , DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SERVICES . WE 'RE IN SOUTH AMERICA , THE MIDDLE EAST , THE AFRICAN SUBCONTINENT- - SOMALIA ? WAS RED PANDA THERE IN ' 91 ? THERE WAS NO RED PANDA IN 1991 . WE WEREN 'T CHARTERED UNTIL ' 98 . AND YOU SEND IN , WHAT , TEAMS OF PEOPLE ? WITH CLEAN WATER SUPPLIES , MOSTLY . THE WARLORDS KEEP MOST EVERYONE OUT , BUT , YOU KNOW , HUMANITARIAN GROUPS LIKE US CAN GET IN . IS THERE ANYONE I COULD TALK TO ABOUT MAYBE ... PIGGYBACKING ON ONE OF RED PANDA 'S TRIPS ? UM ... DOUBT IT . NOT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL , BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WORKING HERE PROBABLY HAVE POLICE RECORDS ( whispers ) AS THICK AS THE BIBLE . WE 'RE NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE . ( normal voice ) UH-HUH .

I 'M GETTING ONE TO GO . WHY DON 'T YOU TELL ME WHAT UPSET YOU EARLIER ? IN MY FLASH-FORWARD , I WAS UNDERWATER . ( whoosh ) SOMEONE WAS DROWNING ME . AND IN THE END , I WAS DEAD . PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME TO INTERPRET WHAT THEY SAW , AND I CAN 'T . ULTIMATELY , INTERPRETATION IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY . HOW COULD MY DROWNING BE GOOD ? WHAT IF YOU WERE BEING BAPTIZED ? WOULDN 'T THAT BE A GOOD THING ? BUT THEN WHY WAS I STRUGGLING ? I 'M SORRY TO SAY I 'VE DROPPED MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN A FULL-IMMERSION BAPTISM ... WATER GETS UP THEIR NOSE . THEY FREAK OUT , SLIP AWAY . BUT I DIED . OR FAINTED . THEY FREAK OUT , SLIP AWAY . MY POINT HERE IS THAT THESE VISIONS ARE JUST A SNAPSHOT.IED. YOU ONLY SEE A SMALL PORTION . THINK OF JESUS AND HIS SACRIFICE . TO HIS DISCIPLES , IT WAS A TRAGEDY BECAUSE THEY COULDN 'T SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE . IT 'S A NEW REALITY FOR EVERYONE WHO CAME AFTER . IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IS HAPPENING NOW ? IT 'S NOT FATE VERSUS FREEWILL . IT 'S FATE AND FREEWILL . BUT HEY , I 'M JUST A SUPER RELIGIOUS WEIRDO DUDE . YOU DON 'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY . BUT EVERY DAY , GOD PUTS SOMETHING GOOD IN YOUR LIFE . EMBRACE IT ... AND LET ALL THE OTHER STUFF FALL AWAY .

THE KID 'S I.Q. SCORES WERE OFF THE CHARTS , YET HE WAS FAILING ALL HIS CLASSES- - BORED , OBVIOUSLY . WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE HIS EXCEPTIONAL POTENTIAL DIDN 'T GO TO WASTE . HE STARTED AT UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHEN HE WAS ONLY 13 . AND THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE YOUTH PHYSICS FELLOWSHIP , THE PhD , THE POST-OP AT N.L.A.P.- - POST-DOC , NOT POST-OP .

THE ONLY THING I 'VE WORKED ON IN THE PAST YEAR HAS- - AT N.L.A.P. THE EXPERIMENT THAT OCCURRED EXACTLY 1 MINUTE AND 47 SECONDS AGO . WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ? PROBABLY KILLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE . WE EXPECT BACKLASH AGAINST THOSE ULTIMATELY FOUND RESPONSIBLE . WHAT A COINCIDENCE THAT YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY ST WHEN WE NEEDED TO CREATE AN ALIBI FOR YOU . SOME KIND OF HUNTING ACCIDENT , WASN 'T IT ? A PRIVATE PLANE WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO TORONTO NOW . THE F.A.A. WILL NOT HAVEA R. ONE MORE THING . WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU WHAT YOU SAW IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD , MAKE UP A STORY AND STICK TO IT . ( indistinct shouting in distance ) HEAR THAT ? THAT IS THE SOUND OF THE WHOLE WORLD WAKING UP .

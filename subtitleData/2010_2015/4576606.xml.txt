 This album was recorded in 1982 . Banner year for metal . They look like they haven 't aged a day . Neither have their haircuts . What 's the matter with you ? Oh , I 'm just- - Thinking about Nikki . Have you seen her since the pump and dump ? No , she um- - She hasn 't called or anything . I don 't know what I did wrong . At least you know what kinda girl she is . Yeah , a slut . Look , these idiots write a song about the pure evil one can 't be a virgin , and then some heavy metal slut shows up out of nowhere , has sex with you and then conveniently disappears ? Doesn 't that seem like an odd coincidence to you ? Sign me up , miss dempsey . Sorry , Zack . It 's track and field , not the special Olympics . If you can 't stand up , you can 't sign up . Oh can 't I. Well you just proved me wrong . Um- - I can 't stop my legs- - Look , Zack Dumphey 's walking ! He must have the book ! I can 't stop my legs ! Help meeeee ! Ahhhhh ! What the hell just happened ? Where did Todd go ? Dude hit the breaks ! I can 't ! I can 't ! Ahhhhhh ! Ahhhhhh ! What the hell- - Hey Zack , are you okay ? Ooookay . Hurry up you shit-roosters ! We 're gonna lose them ! He 's around here somewhere , find him ! Holy shit ! Hey , little dude ! Where ya been ? What the hell is going on ? ! You 'll find out soon enough . Loser . Told you he 'd be back . Hey ! Hey I just want to talk to you for a second ! Where 'd you go ? ! Whack ! He 's coming to . What the hell ? Jenny ? Gah ! Sanddragon ? What did you do to her ? Wanda ? Miss dempsey ? Something isn 't right here . Who are you ? ! I 'm Todd ! Duh ! Todd Smith ! Todd Smith disappeared sixteen years ago . Sixteen years ? That means I must have time traveled ! Wicked . Who are you really ? ! I told you ! I 'm Todd ! What have I really changed that much ? You haven 't changed at all . What are you ? A cyborg ? Android ? Hologram ? ! If I was a hologram you wouldn 't be able to touch me . Slap ! See I 'm not a hologram , I 'm- - Slap ! I told you I 'm Todd from the future ! No wait , this is the future , I 'm from the past , I time traveled here . Remember that day in the hallway where that paraplegic kid got the book , and I had to jump on his back- - You ran down the hall and never returned . I remember . The day everything went to shit . Spit ! Curtis- - Dude what happened to you ? You look so old . It was the corn chips dude . The corn chips . All the chemicals prematurely aged me . Where 's Hannah and Jimmy ? Jimmy died ! A long time ago . He lived as a pervert and he died as a pervert . All I have left of him are his nunchucks . And we haven 't seen Hannah since the incident . We don 't talk about the incident ! Okay , look , I have no idea what 's going on around here , but I promise I 'll take care of everything . Yeah . Sure you will . But until we find out who you really are , you 're gonna be our prisoner . Our sex prisoner ! Please say yes , I 'm so tired of the dildos- - No ! Normal prisoner ! Lock him up . Wait , where are you taking me ? ! Stop ! Stupid sexy one-eyed Jenny . She thinks she 's in charge of me . Pffft . No one 's in charge of me except me . Uhhh ! Hey ! Shhhh ! I 'm getting you out of here dude . The girls are debating whether to torture you , or pleasure you . Can we wait and see which one they choose ? No can do ! We gotta get you back to your time . Curtis , are you gonna tell me what the hell 's going on ? We 're in the middle of a war dude . A bad war . The Femme Batales are the last remaining survivors of the resistance . Who ? The Femme Batales ! That 's what the girls call themselves . Oh . Our mission it to topple the satanic society , and overthrow its leader Atticus Murphy . He must have used the book to do this . Here 's the crazy thing after you disappeared , the book was never seen again . Weird . Yeah- - Curtis ! Where 's my dinner ? ! Dude seriously , you 're their " where 's my dinner " guy ? This is the future Todd . We use the word " chef . " There 's a secret passage to the school through here . If you want to find Zack , this is the only way in . Great but once I find Zack , how do I get back home ? Who said anything about you leaving ? Ah ! Walk away rebel . With just one him . Not on my watch minion ! Does that mean you don 't want- - These ? You think you can buy my best friend off with a bag of junk food , you don 't know Curtis Weaver- - He 's all yours ! Dude what the fuck ? ! You sold me out for a bag of corn chips ! I can 't help it Todd ! I 'm a corn hole addict ! The future has changed you man . Who are you to judge me ? ! I 'm this way because of you ! I lost everything ! Hannah ! Important body parts ! My boyish good looks . Dude all I did was jump on some guy 's back ! How 's I supposed to know that this was gonna happen ? ! You left me Todd ! The corn chips didn 't . Sure I can 't always find them , but that 's because I live under the ground . I know they 're always out there somewhere . Waiting for me . Ahhh- - I hope you choke on them . Spit ! They 're so tasty ! They 're so tasty ! I 'm sorry Todd ! Really ? Hello Todd Smith . So nice to see you again . Welcome to my lair . This is your office . No guidance counselors have offices . Satanic overlords have lairs . Aren 't you going to congratulate me ? On being a crazy asshole ? No way . You can 't talk to me like that , Todd Smith . I 'm the big cheese around here . The cock of the walk . I 'm a big cock . Wait a second . There 's no way you took over crowley heights all by yourself you 're way too stupid . True . The first part of what you said is true . The second part about me being stupid , is stupid . But you 're right . I did have some help . Hannah ? Hello Todd . Ew you hooked up with Atticus ! Ugh , that - is that the other half of sanddragon lodged in your skull ? A little sensitivity please ! It 's alright sugar dumpling . I don 't mind . Yes Todd ! You 're correct . I do have a sword lodged in my skull ! It happened shortly after the three-way with Curtis . And Jenny . You guys had a three-way and you didn 't invite me ? Thanks a lot . You disappeared ! Remember ? ! Oh ... So the three-way 's the incident nobody wants to talk about . The three-way happened before the incident . So then what was the incident ? I don 't talk about the incident ! What I will talk about is the sword in my skull . You see the blade has permanently damaged my brain 's capacity for morality and empathy , transforming me into evil Hannah . I prefer new and improved Hannah . Mature Hannah . Satanic queen Hannah . Well enjoy being evil while it lasts , because your days of fear and oppression are ending right now ! Is that why you 're here ? To destroy us ? No actually I came here by accident . We know all about your adventures in time . I was in the lab examining your friend . The one with the vibrating legs . Zack 's still alive ? If by alive you mean brain-dead , then yes . We know that Zack used the book . We searched him but we couldn 't find the book . Which means you must know where it is . Uh no I don 't . Liar ! Whack ! Show us the book Todd ! I don 't have it . Whack ! If you refuse to cooperate , you leave us no choice but to- - Kill you ! If we kill him , he can 't show us where he hid the book , now can he ? Boy you really are stupid . Let 's torture him . Oh this work can make a man do terrible things . I sold out my best friend . For a bag of corn chips . So he wasn 't working for the society . He was innocent . We could have fucked him afterall ! Now that the corn chips have been eaten , my guilt has set in in my stomach . Maybe it 's heartburn , maybe it 's an ulcer , all I know is I have something in my stomach and it hurts . What 's your point Curtis ? We need to go back to the school , rescue Todd and send him back to his time . Forget it ! Not our problem . Curtis is right , Todd is a good man . A real man . Hey ! My balls may be made out of tin , but my wiener is only half made out of tin , the other half is rubber . I 'm not going to put my life on the line for some skid . You 're still angry that he had sex with that girl all those years ago- - Her name was Nikki ! And no , I 'm not . Besides there are four of us and hundreds of them . We have to think of our own survival . What happened to the Femme Batales I once knew ? ! The ones who were brave and fearless ! And had balls ! Bigger balls th any man or beast . I used to affectionately call you my " Femme balls . " But somehow you let your vaginas take over . And they smothered your balls to death ! And now you 're just a bunch of pussies with no balls . Is anyone else confused ? All I can think of are balls- - What the hell are you talking about Curtis ? ! If we don 't stand up to the forces of evil tonight , Atticus will keep winning and we 'll keep losing ! Don 't you want to take revenge on the harlet that took your eye ? ! Hannah ! Come on girls ! I need to fuck or fight ! Since there 's no one to fuck , what do you say commander ? One more battle for old time sake ? Gather your weapons ! We strike at midnight . Victory ! In your face ! Yeah ! Would you like me to tell how we 're gonna torture you ? Uh- - I 'd prefer it if you didn 't ? First you 're gonna slap me real hard to get me in the mood . Wrong torture sugar dumpling . Don 't ruin the surprise . You 're right- - All you need to know is we 're gonna torture you and you 're not gonna like it . Ahhhhhhh ! Minions , attack ! Why are you just standing there ? Hannah ! What you 're gonna kill me with a spatula ? Razor-sharp spatula . Well- - If it isn 't Curtis and Femme Batales . Where 's your leader ? Jenny whore-linski . Right behind you . Sandragon , nah ! You 're welcome . Alright Femme Batales ! Time to do your thing . Our thing ! Ahhhhh ! You came back for me . I 'm sorry I screwed you dude . All the corn chips in the world can 't replace you Todd . You think I 'm going down that easy ? Atticus Murphy Jr. doesn 't go down for anyone that easy . Now could someone please remove this blade from my back . What are you waiting for skid ? Get out of here ! Todd listen- - There 's something I have to tell you . You don 't have to say anything Jenny . You want me to stay , because you love me so much . And I get that but , I gotta fix the future babe . I was just gonna say- - Don 't get yourself killed . Oh uh- - Okay . We gotta go get Zack . He 's in the science lab , come on ! I missed you Todd . Come on death ! Grab me with your steely claws and drag me into the abyss ! I dare you . I double dare you ! Oh , no , no , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait- - I had a really bad day and didn 't mean to blame it on you . Let 's be friends . We did it . We won ! That 's what you think Jenny . Say hello to my lazer friend . You 're gonna pay for jamming a sword in my brain cyclops ! Got more where that came from sword brain ! Ugh ! Hannah- - I 'm sorry about the incident . I 'm not . There he is ! So how do I do this ? Uh , easy ! We cut off his legs and yours and then we switch them . You do it . How about we don 't cut off his legs and I just get on his back ? Yeah that could work too . Hey- - What if this doesn 't work and I 'm stuck in this future forever ? Then we move in together . We 'll get bunk beds . I was gonna say I 'll miss you dude , but I 'll see you real soon . I hope . I miss the younger me . Make sure and tell that fuckle-head to lay off the corn chips okay ? You got it . Wow he 's really heavy for a paraplegic . Watch it ! Jenny ! No ! Hannah ! No ! Todd you gotta get back to the present and make sure this future never happens ! Go now ! Todd wait ! I may be totally off on this one but if y r run forwards , you may go forwards in time . Maybe you should run backwards . Yeah that 's actually a pretty good point . This tumor 's good for something . I always loved you ! You mean as a friend right ? ! That too ! It 's sure gonna be lonely- - Here- - In the future . Slam ! Please let me be back . It sure looks the same- - Better check outside to make sure . Jimmy ? But he looks so young ? You double crossed us little dude ! Zap ! Shit ! Zap ! Little fucker man ! I must 've gone too far in the past . Zap ! Shitty . That loser 's locked us out of the school . You haven 't won yet little we 'll be waiting for ya . For as long as it takes . Yeah suck it ! Well , we better get that little twat man . Jimmy ! Nikki ? No it couldn 't be ? Come on let 's get out of here . Zap ! Don 't think I can babe ... Yes you can , they are gone . No I mean I really don 't think I can get out f here . I 'm trapped inside . I told you the book was bad news . Wait babe , I 'm sorry ! Oh shit , my ride ! What the hell just happened ? Where did Todd go ? Ahhhhhhhhh ! Slam ! Ugh- - Hey guys ! What the hell just happened ? I 'll tell you about it later . Actually it 's probably best if I didn 't . Come on . Hey ! Hey I was eating those ! Dude trust me you 're gonna thank me one day . What happened to the book ? Maybe it got lost somewhere in time .

 IJON TICHY - SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem Flying my rocket on Saturday , September 23rd ... near the Milky Way ... I was finally leading ... the life a cosmic hero deserved . Look at the floor , it 's a mess . I could concentrate on important things ... 'cause I 'd finally gotten my holographic invention to work perfectly . Well , almost ... Hey , what 're you doing ? Keep your eyes on the road ! I have a growling belly . Time for a yummy omelet ! Holy Crap ! I told you to tidy up ! You said to navigate and pay attention ! - That 's the problem : I always have to tell you what to do . I invented you to clean up this rocket . So start cleaning ! How dare you ! Mr. Tichy , I 'd appreciate more respect . I 'm only human , after all . Human ? You 're joking . I 'm the human . And the hero . You 're just a holograph , got that ? So clean up this mess , or I 'll blow up your fuses ! Hey , all our provisions are gone ! So what ? Why didn 't you take care of this ? What are we gonna eat ? Mr. Tichy , that 's not my problem . I 'm just the hologram . You 're the human here . - What ? Yuck , a little out-of-date ... I had a brochure for the Egg Planet somewhere ... Every thing has its proper place . This holograph is useless . Remember that ? I have to do it all . There 's only one person in the cosmos ... I can count on : Myself : Ijon Tichy ! HERO OF THE COSMOS After a long flight , when I finally reached the address of the Egg Planet ... there was nothing there ! A big fat planet couldn 't just disappear like that ? Maybe I took a wrong turn ? This place was a bit scary . I was worried : Where was I supposed to get fresh-omelet eggs ? My growled-up belly . I need to eat . Oh well , on the outside , nice and fresh ! What 's this ? An unsolved problem . Let 's look it up in the Cosmic Encyclopedia . The Cosmic Encyclopedia had the answer to every problem . What are you doing ? I 'm the boss , it 's my book collection . I 'll look it up . Didn 't you just say I should be more independent ? But not like this ! That 's not the plan . It said this munching hole was a cosmic emergency . And to immediately go to Professor Tarantoga for help . My chair ! Find the address ! This crap hole is dangerous ! It ate my chair ! I did that while you were loafing around . It 's a cosmic emergency after all . There 's no time to lose . Ok , then ... fly faster ! I said - fly faster , you ! We 're there ! - What ? It 's just around the corner . It was the address ... of the Institute of the Cosmic Encyclopedia ... where they stored all the info on the cosmos . Welcome to the Institute of the Cosmic Encyclopedia . Please fill out form 44F yellow to 77Y purple . Then you will be covered for cosmic development ... and your data entered into the primeval soup . Silly crap ! I 'm Ijon Tichy . This is an emergency ! Upon entry we require your data on the primeval soup ! Oh , too pretty hologram . Paper jam ! To fill out forms and boring paperwork ... use her . Welcome to the Institute of the Cosmic Encyclopedia . We need your personal data ... and wishes for the new cosmic development through the primeval soup . Primeval soup ? What 's that ? It was hard to find my way around this place . I was going in circles . But suddenly there I was . At the professor 's door ! Hello ? I 've often heard of stuck-up space pilots , but your guy seems even worse . I 'm sure we can help you out with the big bang . Hello ? I just found a munching hole in the universe . Is this the right address ? Yes , it 's right . - Is that the guy ? The cosmos is being destroyed ! That 's just my holographic servant appliance . Analogue Hallucinette . I made her all by myself . I know , she told me about you ... - I 'm Ijon Tichy . The clumsy crash pilot ! - Cosmic Hero . Cosmic Hero ? But the cosmos is being destroyed ! What ? The cosmos is being wiped out ? The universe is being destroyed . But I 'm working on a solution ! No . Professor ! I have a clue . A clue to my heritage , my home planet . I told you to stay away till I 'm done here . I give my assistant Mel simple research tasks ... Mel ! The void has re-emerged ! What now ? Is it dangerous ? You can say that again , we 're all gonna die . The universe is being destroyed . What ? The universe ... It began with a big bang . That created everything ! But the question is : What came before the big bang ? Nothingness ! And now the void is dissolving our universe ! Because it doesn 't like it anymore ... or it saw something ugly out there . All we can do now is : Die . Or come up with our own big bang . That 's why we need the primeval soup ... and a cosmo-gigantic cannon ! We 'll place this target in front of the void ... and fire the cosmo-gigantic cannon ... ... with the new primeval soup ... into the void . Creating a new big bang and a new evolution . And the universe is ours again . That 's how we conquer the void . Simple , isn 't it ! I 've prepared the new primeval soup . Looks like a stew my granny made . Nonsense ! I 've been cooking this soup for years in case the void returned . I season it every now and then . Are you crazy , you fool ! Just one taste is enough to extinguish entire future civilizations ! Or even entire planets ! - But it smells so good ! Only when the primeval soup is done correctly ... can the universe re-emerge exactly as it was . We have to shoot the primeval soup into the void ... setting off a big bang to recreate our universe . Due to all the information in the primeval soup ... it should be an exact copy of this universe . I 'm going to load the primeval soup into the cosmo-gigantic cannon and fire it . Your job is to place the target right in front of the void . Cannon , huh ? A bit teensy-weensy for the great professor . Fiddlesticks ! This is my apple peeler ! That is the cosmo-gigantic cannon ! He had a long one ! Well , if that 's what it took to save my world , then ok . Here are the latest calculations for the primeval soup , Professor . She did them . Too pretty hologram , self destruction initiated ! Like I said : Place the target directly over the void ... so that I can get a good shot from here . We can only do this once , and can 't afford to miss . That 's your role in saving the universe ! I know every corner of the universe , I 'm the hero ! I 'll save the universe , got that ? Ok , wise guy . Mel ! Stop pestering him . - You really know every corner ? I mean , every corner of the universe ? If you want to play the hero , Mr ... Tichy . - Whatever . Ijon Tichy ! You should hurry up ! Way to go ! My order ... to speed it up . What a goofball ! " COSMIC ENCYCLOPEDIA " What was I thinking , I forgot to put myself into the soup . I 'm in ! I 'm in ! I 'm fed up with you showing off . In my universe I lay down the law : I 'm the hero , you 're the holograph . Got that ? But I 'm sick of living in your narrow-minded world . And your so-called " unbendable " rules are a joke you won 't be laughing at soon . I 'm going to load the cannon , so don 't mess around with the target ! What did Professor Tarantoga say ? The void is dissolving the cosmos 'cause it doesn 't like it any more ? Well Mr. Tichy , if I were the void and saw your underwear out there ... I 'd want to end the world too . What ? Silly crap ! The void must have gotten into your empty head ! Careful ! Oh great ! GRANNY 'S PEA SOUP Tarantoga 's ... primeval soup . I 'd better take over now . This involves the creation of my ... the universe . - What ? Stop it ! Give me that ! - No ! Hurry up ... Mel ? Mel ? Let go ! Enough now ! Hand it over ! Ok , then you do it . But be very careful ! Nah , I won 't do it . You can 't tell me what I have to do . My cosmic cannon is ready . Where 's that damn target ? I 'll save the universe when I feel like it ! You were so eager a moment ago . - But not now . Maybe later . What ? Look at that ? The whole primeval soup-mess is in our kitchen ! Now I know what to do . You 're gonna clean it up . Mr. Tichy ? Inside the weird bubble ... I saw a parallel universe ! An exact copy of the universe ... the way it should come out of the primeval soup ! A yummy omelet ... I told you to stay in your closet at meals , huh ? What 's going on here ? I 'm fed up with you showing off . Get back in that closet now ! In my universe I lay down the law : I 'm the hero and you 're the holograph ! Got that ? This parallel universe was made up of the information from the colorful forms ... and was full of mistakes ! Just you wait ... Mama ! Make that ugly holograph go away ! I can 't eat with that thing in the kitchen ! Now it 's gone . Let 's eat the yummy food ! You 'll pay for this , you manipulative machine ! I saw through your plan . It didn 't work on me . Did I aim right ? Where did the shot go ? You old couch-potato fart ! You missed ! Thanks only to me , Ijon Tichy ... the void-hole and that awful parallel universe were destroyed . I saved the world ! But the Egg Planet still wasn 't in its place . A new universe ? Very nice ! It worked . I 've saved the universe ! What did you just say ? You saved the universe ? You 're joking ! I did all the work , but the Egg Planet is still missing . Egg Planet ? You 're flying in the wrong direction , you fool . It 's at the other end of the galaxy ! So , the void and the parallel universe destroyed each other . This created a mixture of the two universes . The old and the new . This here ... is the mixture ! What did you say ? A mish-mashed cosmos ? Yes , mixed up , you twit ! You have no idea about anything . Now I was starting to panic ! The new universe was meshed with the universe manipulated by the Hallucinette . I feared the worst . Mr. Tichy , would you mind getting our little one out of the closet ? Our little one goes better with the curtains , don 't you think ? Yeah , that 's great ! And now we 're going to have a little equal rights , ok ? Go and have a nap ... while I take care of everything . That 's so nice of you . Equal rights . More respect ! Thank you , I 'll go take that nap . When I saw the brochure of the Egg Planet ... I realized the professor was right . I was completely off course . The Egg Planet was at a totally different address . So I had to bear and grin it ! Because of fresh omelet eggs ... I now had to fly to the other end of the universe . People later said that I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... But lost all inhibitions on long space voyages . God knows how this rumor got started . People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap than perfectly good facts .

Yeah , well , I don 't like it much either . There 's a surprise . Lighten up , Vince , a bit of dust never hurt anyone . It 's not the dust I 'm worried about . VINCE : Harrington , you seeing this ? - Yeah , it 's a beast . Cycle down the backup grids in case we lose anything .

Unfortunately , Brunel wants you back at the briefing . KIM : Well , he 'll have to wait , won 't he ? Ten things about Mars you won 't miss when you 're back on Earth . Only ten ? Er ... Storms . Your driving . Kim . Kim . Kim . A six-month commute home in a floating coffin . With Kim . Is that ten ? I 've lost count already . It 's not a coffin , Vince . But that 's an interesting choice of word . OK . A nice big spaceship . What do you want me to say ? WOMAN : We get out and walk at the end . On green grass . Under blue skies . Yeah . Green grass . Blue skies . VINCE : ♪ Blue skies around the corner ♪ Everything 's gonna be right ♪ Never a cloud in those bright blue skies ♪ [ Hums ] WOMAN : Running late , Kim . KIM : Don 't worry , I 'll take the heat . WOMAN : Did you get all the samples you wanted ? Does it matter ? We 're still going back empty handed . Come on , Kim . That 's not fair . We 've achieved a lot here . Yeah ? Like what ? As far as I 'm concerned , we 're just sharpening pencils for the next crew . Whoever remembers the second man on the moon anyway ? WOMAN : It was Buzz Aldrin . VINCE : Yeah , first man to piss on the moon . What ? He pissed himself on the moon . You didn 't know that ? Well , that 's something for us all to aspire to , isn 't it ? I just don 't want to go home with nothing . Six months isn 't enough time . - You could always stay . - Vincent , why don 't you just go fu ... Let 's go . MAN 1 : Rover One , where are you ? We 've got circuits failing . VINCE : Sorry . Got held up . On our way . Alright , but we need you back here . We 've lost our link to the Aurora and Harrington can 't handle it alone . MAN 2 : Where 's Vincent ? I wanna talk to my daughter . MAN 1 : On his way , I hope . MAN 2 : Six months cruising and now this . Bit of a mess . MAN 2 : Be alright . We 're on the home stretch . One more day . Hey . When you wake up , I 'd love to know how long it 'll be before skylink 's restored . Sorry . Nearly there . [ Computer beeps ] Ah , yeah . This should be it . Here we go . MAN : We 've lost your signal , do you copy ? Sorry , guys . We had a power outage due to the storm . MAN : Yeah , we can see it from Sat Four . You had us worried there for a minute . Alright , time check : final approach burn in 19 hours , 56 minutes . Alright , copy that . Safe orbit . Be great to see you guys again . Brunel out . MAN : For fuck 's sake . BRUNEL : Alright . Manual check everything . All systems . WOMAN : What are you so happy about ? HARRINGTON : Vince , tell me you 're close by . We 're on our own until you get these systems back online . VINCE : Roger that . Almost there . Keep losing charge on this thing . Don 't want to push it too hard . Roger that , Vince . MAN : I need a word . BRUNEL : Alright . OK . - I need to go back out again . - Forget it . We 've got a briefing . We need everyone on base . What 's going on ? Gamma sensor at Site Nine is not responding . Storm damage , possibly . I don 't know . You didn 't check it before you came back ? What do you want me to say ? I 'm a fucking idiot ? I 'm sorry . Yeah , I 'm sorry , too . The sun 's about to go down . I signed off on that site . I 'll be quick . It 's going to look bad if the relief crew has to come out and fix it . A lot of things need fixing around here . You 'll have Vincent in no time . Take Harrington ... and make sure you 're back before dark . - Is that clear ? - Thank you . I want everybody cleaned up before we do our final briefing . You know I don 't fuck around . Harrington , let 's go . Rover number two , now . Sir , you want us to go outside ? Yes , make sure you 're back before dark . [ Sighs ] WOMAN : Are you alright ? - Huh ? VINCE : Yeah . Yeah . Listen . [ Beep ] Never get sick of that sound . VINCE : Where are you guys going ? - Soak up some more radiation . Try making babies after this mission , huh ? WOMAN : Too funny . Well , I 'm laughing . What the hell are you doing ? Harry , if that cooling system 's down , I 'm gonna need your help back there . Sorry , man . You 're gonna have to speak to Brunel . It 's not my call . [ Sings in Serbian ] We bust our arses to get back here and those pricks get to fucking go out again . 19 hours . It 's just 19 hours . So what do you know about cooling systems ? HARRINGTON : So what 's the score ? SERBIAN : Marko Petrovic one , Kim nil . - What ? - Never mind . We 're fixing a broken sensor . Didn 't you hear ? Right . So are we gonna be long ? Well , it takes as long as it takes . Oh , come on , man . Brunel 's not gonna like this . You want to speed things up , Harry , go prep the sample boxes , OK ? Date , grid reference , and new prefix . MA1 . MA1 ? Microscopic Anomaly . - Hold on . Does Brunel know ? - Just trust me on this one , OK ? [ Chuckles ] Are you cosy in there ? Like a bug in a rug . - You talk to Ella ? - No , I missed the window . Shit , man . I 'm sorry about that . I got ... you know , delayed . - Kim . - Yeah . Never mind . I 'll get another chance back on Aurora . Hey , I come bearing gifts . You want some ? - Jesus Christ . - What 's up ? Half the CO2 scrubbers are down on the Aurora . Check out this approach trajectory . These guys are gonna get pulled over for drunk driving . Can 't we at least get on board before you start worrying about the Aurora ? Aren 't you excited to go home ? Home isn 't the issue . It 's the six months it takes to get there strapped to the back of a nuclear warhead I 'm worried about . [ Sighs ] - What ? - Are you alright ? [ Chuckles ] Come on , Irwin . Can we please not do analysis thing right now ? I got a lotta work to do . You know how it is . You 're not happy if things aren 't working . I 'm not happy if you 're not happy . I 'm happy . I 'm ecstatic . See ? - OK . Alright . - See ? Happy , happy , happy . IRWIN : Alright . We 're happy . VINCE : Oh-oh . Get the popcorn out . [ Muffled argument ] IRWIN : Who 's your money on ? You kidding me ? Kim . Every time . She 's got a point , though . How come Marko gets a free pass ? So , what do you reckon ? We all go back home , find God , write a poem about it like the moon walkers did ? It did change them . They all said so . People don 't really change . Put ' em under enough pressure , you find out who they are . Oh God , that is deep . Are you gonna put that in a poem ? That was uncomfortable . [ Whines ] What 's she doing ? Kim , that 's Marko 's workstation . I just wanna know what 's so urgent . You can 't go through his private log . Come on , Vincent , tell her ! [ Chuckles ] Oh , yeah . Like she 's gonna listen to me . This is bullshit . Kim , She 's right . Just cos he broke the rules , it doesn 't make it fair game . There 's no way Marko gives a shit about a broken sensor . OK ? I just want to know why his research is more important than mine . What ? That 's definitely not what it looks like . Those cavities in the rock ... those could be microbial borings . PAH 's can be formed non-organically . LANE : Is this still under the scope ? KIM : I 'll check . Alright , anyone wanna tell me what 's going on ? Nothing 's going on . He found a piece of abiotic mineral . Bullshit . Got it . Holy shit . BRUNEL : That looks like ... WOMAN : Cell division ... Bacterial cell division . BRUNEL : I want that site locked down . No one goes near it . We 'll upload the scans and data to mission control . See if they confirm Lane 's conclusions . You can 't do this . We need to speak to Marko first . It 's his find . He 's the one who 's been playing silly games . Why didn 't he talk to us ? Because that would be sharing the credit . That 's not fair . I think we 're missing the point . This is what we came here for , isn 't it ? - Don 't you think we had to check it out ? LANE : He knows what he 's doing . So we 'll entrust the greatest find in human history to a man who just lied to you ? Is that it ? Rover Two , this is base . You at Site Nine yet ? Yeah . We , erm , we got here a couple of minutes ago . What 's up , sir ? BRUNEL : I 'm declaring the site off limits . Put Marko on now . Yep . Stand by , base . Marko , I 've got Brunel on comms . Are you copying any of this ? That 's negative . [ Speaks Serbian ] Can you speak in English please , mate ? Tell them the signal is breaking up . Tell them you can 't see me now . Tell ... [ Mutters Serbian ] I 've got Brunel holding on the other line . Don 't argue with me now . Just come out and bring the camera with you . You have to see this , Harry . It 's beautiful . Harry ! Harry ! Help ! Marko ! Come on ! [ Pants ] Oh , my God . HARRINGTON : Mayday ! This is Harrington to base . I need help here . Repeat , Mayday ! Please help . BRUNEL : What happened ? HARRINGTON : He 's gone . Have you been down there to him ? Why aren 't you down there , Harrington ? - I tried . - Well , you didn 't try hard enough . - I 'm gonna go down there ! - No , Dalby . - He could still be alive ! - You 're gonna ripped your suit and break your your neck . - I haven 't pronounced it yet . - I 'm pronouncing it , Dalby . He 's dead . I 'm not gonna risk another life . So stand down . People are pulled from frozen water all the time and revived . - You don 't know he 's dead . You don 't know ! - Dalby , stand down . - [ Sniffs ] - Stand down . He said he 'd found something , sir . Nobody goes down there until we 've got the right gear . We 've gotta run this by mission control . How long will it take ? Altogether 30 , 40 minutes . Sir . Er ... I really wanna stay here . We can 't just leave him like this . No . I need to do it . You 've done enough . You 're not gonna do anything stupid , are you ? You 're not gonna go in that pit . Is that clear ? - Is that clear ? - [ Sniffs ] Yes , sir . Alright . OK . This is Brunel . Contact mission control . We 've had an accident . LANE : Did you see him ? - No . Look , skipper , if there 's any chance he 's alive , we need to get back out there . No . There 's no way he survived that fall without compromising his suit . We 'll pull him out as soon as we hear back from mission control . So when are we planning on announcing the discovery ? You really are something else aren 't you , Kim ? I wasn 't stuck in here yet . This discovery changes everything . Takes precedence over everything , right ? What about human decency ? So I 'm the bad guy now for staying focused on the mission ? I didn 't get him killed . I 'm sorry , what is that mean , what the fuck are you trying to say there , Kim ? You broke with protocol . Figure it out . - You are fucking ... ! - Hey , hey , hey . You are unbelievable ! - What 's the matter with you ? - Fucking laugh at me . - OK , enough . Away . - OK . Nothing wrong with me . I 'm not the one breaking the rules . LANE : That 's not helpful , Kim . BRUNEL : Just drop it . Cheers , Kim . He 's falling apart . Like everything else around here . Alright . That 's enough . KIM : Am I the only one who 's noticed this ? [ Beeping ] MAN : Base from mission control , responding your priority code 13 . What can we say , guys ? We 're all in deep shock . Marko 's family has been informed of the situation , but we haven 't gone public yet until you confirm his status . The board are working on an official statement , but they 'll be looking for you to put a few words together if it comes down to that . Brunel , we copy your safety concerns , but it 's a go for retrieving Petrovic . Use all caution . Rough way to end the mission , guys , but we 're behind you 100 percent . More soon . 1636 , message ends . You heard him . We 'll retrieve the body , then announce Marko 's discovery . Let 's go . Go ahead . [ Mutters under his breath ] Sir , can I ... ? Can I have a quiet word , please ? Yeah . Skipper , I know it 's not my place , but you can 't let Kim behave like that . Nor anyone else , OK ? Look , I know it 's bad , but we all knew the risks . Honestly , it 's a miracle an accident hasn 't happened up here sooner . I 'm still the one who let them go out . No , I 'm sorry , with all due respect to Marko , he brought this on himself . Any screw-up by anyone on this team , that 's my responsibility . It 's not fair to take Harrington back out . He stays here with Kim . - Alright . - OK . [ Pants ] - [ Radio crackles ] - [ Brunel 's voice , distorted ] Sir , you 're breaking up . Repeat your message . BRUNEL : Rover One all loaded up . Heading back to you . [ Faint noise ] BRUNEL : How are you holding up out there ? Dalby ? - Sorry . For a second , I ... - [ Faint noise ] BRUNEL : What is it , Dalby ? [ Breathes heavily ] BRUNEL : Dalby ? Somebody 's coming in ... You 're breaking up . I can 't hear you . Dalby ? Dalby ? [ Gasps ] BRUNEL : Dalby . Come in , Dalby . Where the hell is she ? We 've had static at Site Nine all day . Maybe the comms are down again . Still doesn 't explain her last response . Lane , Irwin , check Rover Two . BRUNEL : Jeez , it 's still venting steam . VINCE : Must be a lot of water down there . BRUNEL : If she went down there after I told her not to ... Dalby . Come in , Dalby . Please respond . Please respond . There 's nothing in Rover Two . LANE : She wouldn 't disobey an order . Maybe she fell in . VINCE : Can 't see the bottom . How deep do you think it is ? BRUNEL : I don 't like this one bit . Alright , Vince . Strap up . Let 's see what 's down there . VINCE : Yes , sir . VINCE : Gets a little tight down there , doesn 't it ? OK . Here we go . [ Machine whirs ] VINCE : Alright . Jesus . BRUNEL : You alright down there ? VINCE : Oh , yeah . Never better . VINCE : It 's , er ... nice . A walk in the park . Jesus Christ . OK . Mark me off ! Holy shit . BRUNEL : What ? What do you see ? I don 't know . It 's ... In the rock formations , there 's ... something growing on them . Like a ... I don 't know what it is but ... It 's definitely alive . LANE : We should bring him up . I 'm gonna try and get a little lower . See if I can find Marko . - Take me down . BRUNEL : You got it . [ Breathes heavily ] [ Breathing quickens ] [ Heavy breathing ] [ Gasps ] Fuck ! Fuck . Fuck . Fuck . BRUNEL : Vincent . Bring him up . Bring him up . Bring him up ! Give me your hand . Give me your hand ! LANE : Vince , are you alright ? Just breathe . BRUNEL : We gotcha . Come on . That 's it . - Alright . - Vincent ... OK , OK , OK . You 're alright . BRUNEL : Vincent , what did you see ? Vincent ? Vincent ! I 'm OK . I 'm OK . What the hell happened down there ? Nothing . I 'm good . I saw the bottom . They 're not there . IRWIN : i Skipper , it 's Irwin . There 's footprints here . There 's two pairs . BRUNEL : What ? Where are they headed ? IRWIN : They 're crossing the rift valley . They look like they 're headed towards base . BRUNEl : If she pulled him out of there , why didn 't they just take the rover ? It just doesn 't make sense . Call Kim . Tell her to prepare for one , maybe two casualties . KIM : He 'll be in a bad way if he 's been exposed . Possible brain damage from oxygen deprivation , hypoxia ... That 's if we 're lucky . - Look , what I said earlier ... - Shut up , Kim . Shut up . Let 's just forget it , yeah ? [ Beeping ] They 're about 50 metres out . Must be Marko and Dalby . But what the hell ? They walked all the way back ? As long as they 're OK , that 's all that counts , right ? Base to Dalby , can you come in , please ? HARRINGTON : They 're coming around to the airlock . I 'm gonna go let them in . Wait . We haven 't established comms here . [ Air hisses ] Marko ! Oh , fuck . You 're OK , you 're OK . Oh , fuck ! [ Hisses ] [ Gasps ] Marko , what the fuck are you doing ? Marko ! [ Roars ] [ Drill whirs ] [ Screams ] [ Moans ] [ Alarm ] [ Roars ] Go ! Base , this is Brunel . Come in , please . BRUNEL : Come in , please . Base . [ Beeping ] [ Snarls ] [ Grunts ] Mayday ! Mayday ! BRUNEL : Harrington ? Harrington , please respond . Lane , Irwin , check the other side . - Call me if you see anything . IRWIN : OK . BRUNEL : Harrington . Come in , Harrington . - You better stay out here . - I 'm fine . I 'm coming with you . Just stay on comms . I 'll call you if I need you . Look , Skipper . I know I was a little shaky back there . That 's an order . Don 't argue with me . [ Kim yells ] [ Slurps ] [ Rasps ] [ Screams ] Hey , explain to me what the hell 's going on here . Fuck . [ Shrieks ] We need to quarantine them here . Get in a suit . I 'll buy you time . Go , go , go . I 'm right behind you . Listen to me . Marko , you 're sick . I want to help you . Can you understand me ? I want to help you . [ Marko growls ] Vincent , Lane , I 'm in the airlock . I 'm coming out . VINCE : What happened in there ? - They 're killing us ! IRWIN : Kim ? What happened in there ? [ Snarls ] LANE : Are you alright ? What happened ? IRWIN : Just breathe . - Marko and Dalby are dead . They couldn 't have survived . But they 're still moving . She 's not making sense . If they 're moving , they 've got brain function . If they 've got brain function . They 're not dead , Kim . I 'm not a fucking idiot , Irwin ! I know . VINCE : The airlock . KIM : Jesus . KIM : It 's Brunel . BRUNEL : Lock the door ! Lock the door ! Fuck ! KIM : Seal it up . Don 't let them get out ! IRWIN : He 's bleeding . BRUNEL : Need to seal it . IRWIN : He 's got a tear ! He 's bleeding . LANE : Hold it , hold it , hold it . IRWIN : You 're OK . You 're OK . LANE : Yeah , I 've got it . What 's Kim doing ? She 's ... Kim ! Kim ! Kim ! What the hell are you doing ? VINCE : Kim ! No , that 's the door lock ! Kim , stop ! No , they 're still in there ! Get off me . Get off me ! It 's OK . You disabled it . They can 't get out . You don 't know what they did ! Look for yourself ! IRWIN : Vincent ? What happened to them ? What the hell happened to them ? It 's low pressure . They 've got the bends . When are you guys gonna get it ? It 's not them any more ! They 're gone now ! [ Bang ] Fuck ! That door is reinforced steel . They can 't get through . They have power tools . They have high explosives . - They can 't get out - The decompression 'll kill them . - It won 't . LANE : Brunel 's in a bad way . - We need to move him now . - Fuck . VINCE : Alright , let 's get him to the hydroponic dome . Kim , get the airlock . Let 's go . Now ! LANE : OK , we 're gonna move you now . - We 've gotta go now ! Move ! - Come on , skipper , let 's go . LANE : One , two , three . - [ Brunel groans ] - Oh , shit ! LANE : Just a little bit . VINCE : Almost there . Come on . Come on , you can do it . LANE : You 're nearly there . VINCE : You can do it . [ Air hisses ] - Have you got him ? - Yeah . Gently , gently . - Irwin , get out the way . Out the way . - OK , OK . - Sit him up . - I 'm trying . LANE : Careful . - Alright . OK . One , two , three . Mind his neck . - It 's OK . - Gently , gently . VINCE : There you go . [ Exhales ] LANE : Captain , stay awake and focus , OK ? I 'm OK ... It 's just nothing ... Nothing feels right inside . LANE : I 'll give you a shot . - Doesn 't feel right . IRWIN : Gonna give you some morphine , OK ? - Here we go . LANE : Alright . We 've got to get this open . [ Winces ] LANE : Jeez . IRWIN : Oh , God . Vincent , I 'm not a medic . I can 't do this . Lane , if anyone can do this , you can . Just tell me what you need . VINCE : Come on . Hey , I know that look . You don 't have to ... [ Groans ] Oh , God . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . [ Groans ] There should be more blood . Six months . What a mess . I thought we were home free . - What 's Kate gonna tell the kids ? LANE : Shh . Shh . I can 't ... I can 't remember what they look like . You tell them I was thinking about them . Would you do that for me ? I will . Of course . Of course I will . We 've seen things that no one has seen before . They can 't take that away from us , right ? No . God , I 'm thirsty . Thirsty . - I 've got it . BRUNEL : Thirsty . VINCE : Stay here , skipper . Come on . Just breathe . Nice and easy . You 're gonna be OK . OK . OK , stay there . It 's OK . It 's me . It 's Irwin . It 's OK . OK , careful . Beareful . Get some more . Kim , get some more . OK . Hey , I 'm with you . BRUNEL : You have to ... You have to ... You gotta help me . You gotta help . - [ Grunts ] - No ! Stop ! VINCE : Skipper , no ! Let go ! LANE : Jesus ! Get off him ! Skipper ! Stop ! No ! [ Brunel roars ] Look at me ! Look at me ! You 're OK , you 're OK . Come on . Goddamn it ! Stop , please ! - Please . Just look at me . - [ Gasps ] It 's OK . Just breathe . Just breathe . Come on , come on , come on . Look at me . Look at me , come on . Please . Come on . Just breathe . You 're OK . Skipper . You 'll never see home . What the fuck was that ? He didn 't mean that . He couldn 't . He couldn 't . IRWIN : Kim . - Kim , he 's gone . - Don 't touch me . What the hell are you doing ? You think he 's dead , right ? IRWIN : Vincent ... Kim , he 's gone . Kim . Get your hands off him . Get away from him ! - He has gone . - Think about it , Irwin . Marko and Dalby are out there exposed to the atmosphere and they 're still moving . It can 't be how it looks . There must be some explanation for this . [ Beeping ] IRWIN : I 've had enough of this place . I just want to go home . I 'm done . I 'm done , Vincent . He said he couldn 't remember his children . I just want to see my little girl . I wanna see Ella . [ Sobs ] [ Sumbling ] [ Alarm beeps ] KIM : They 've blown the dome . LANE : We need to contact the Aurora . KIM : Comms are down . Till we fix them , we 're trapped . What about the O2 feed pipe ? It 's the only thing connecting the two domes . We can get back to the main base without them even seeing us . If I can get through and fix the skylink , I can reach the Aurora , and ask for help . If they 've blown the dome , it won 't be pressurised . VINCE : There 's a seal at both ends . If I close it behind here and equalize the pressure , it should hold when I open the other side . - And if it doesn 't , we 're all dead . - And what do you suggest ? What about Harrington ? When they blew the dome , he wasn 't wearing a suit . [ Banging ] - Are you sure they can 't get in ? - How the fuck should I know ? The failsafe is designed to keep the door closed . [ Clunking ] We need to deal with this now . If Harrington has gone , Vincent 's the only one that can fix the skylink . He 's the only one . I 'm heading back . - I 'm going with you . - No . There 's no point . What if Marko and Dalby return to the base ? We 'll keep them busy . Just , er , close this behind me and leach off the air at the other end so it doesn 't blow . VINCE : Lane , you copy me ? LANE : I got you . Are you gonna be okay ? Alright ? VINCE : Yeah . You keep Marko and Dalby on your side and I 'll be fine . LANE : I wasn 't talking about them . VINCE : I know . [ Vincent breathes heavily ] OK . [ Computer beeps ] IRWIN : Jesus , is that ... ? KIM : It 's the same as Marko 's sample . LANE : It 's infected his bloodstream . [ Groans ] [ Breathes heavily ] [ Groans ] Lane ... Lane ! VINCE : No , stop . No ... LANE : It 's OK . - You 're having another attack . VINCENT : I can 't ... Can you hear me ? LANE : Vincent . What happened on the Aurora , what happened on the way over here , it 's in the past , alright ? VINCE : I can 't ... I can 't do it . - You can do this , OK ? I have seen you build a comm system out of a fucking shaving kit , so don 't tell me you can 't handle this . [ Chuckles ] They 're supposed to test us for this shit . Weed out people like me . You think the rest of us aren 't on the verge of coming unstuck ? Was Marko acting rationally in the last few days ? Was anyone ? You were . If you think I 'm handling this any better , then I 'm worried about you . In case you haven 't noticed , I 'm barely holding it together . Vincent . No matter how tight it gets in there , I will be with you . I know . Thanks . VINCENT : Lane , you still there ? LANE : Yeah , I 'm here . Are you at the base ? Yeah . Something awful happened here . There 's blood everywhere . We 'll try and keep Marko and Dalby busy . We 're looking for something to immobilise them with . OK . I 'm gonna try and get some power up . Might take a while . I 'll keep you posted . LANE : It can 't be that simple . - What can 't ? Well , it 's a bacteria , isn 't it ? We 've got a whole range of antibiotics here . We 've got tetracycline , cephalosporin , erythromycin , penicillin . And if they do work , how do we deliver them ? They won 't stand there while we inject them . Decontamination spray in the airlock . We atomize it in a contained space . We need to find a way to test it . [ Broken glass crunches ] Come on . Come on , baby . LANE : OK , we 've got something . Blood sample 12 is reacting to the cephalosporin . Are we gonna do this or not ? Better hold him steady . Irwin ? Get over here . For fuck 's sake , Irwin . Hold his head . No pulse . Here goes . [ Grunts ] - Captain ... KIM : It 's just a reflex . - Maybe he 's trying to fight it . - Brunel 's gone . He 's not here any more . Fixed and dilated . Let 's test his blood again . LANE : No multiplication . Almost zero motility . KIM : You sure this is gonna work as a vapor ? LANE : Well , it works intravenously , so it has to . Tantalus base to Aurora . Do you copy , Aurora ? Tantalus base to Aurora . Mayday , Mayday . Do you copy , Aurora ? MAN : This is Aurora , we copy your Mayday . Christ , you don 't know how good you guys sound . We 've got an emergency down here . We need ... What the ... ? No , no , no , no , no . Oh , shit . They 've just given up . Kim , they 're leaving ! They 're heading to base . I can 't see them . We 've got to get them in here , now ! [ Thud ] [ Thud ] Oh , please . Kim , Kim . [ Beeping ] [ Air hisses ] Get a syringe . IRWIN : Fuck . Where 's Marko ? - Irwin , get a syringe . - [ Dalby roars ] LANE : Just wait . - What ? The bacteria 's developing a resistance . The effect 's only temporary . [ Thud ] [ Crackling ] [ Growls ] [ Growls ] No , no ! [ Vince groans ] [ Yells ] [ Grunts ] Down ! Down ! Stay down ! [ Growls ] Oh , for fuck 's sake . [ Yells ] VINCE : Lane ! Harrington 's behind me ! I couldn 't seal the tunnel . Open the panel ! He 's in the tunnel . Harrington 's after him . He hasn 't sealed the other end . Get your helmets on . [ Harrington growls ] Open the panel ! LANE : Okay ? IRWIN : Go , go . Open the fucking panel ! [ Wind howls ] KIM : Move , move ! Get out of here . We 'll follow . LANE : Why won 't it open ? VINCE : The failsafe is set to lock in case of a breach . I have to reboot it to get it open . [ Keypad beeps ] LANE : Irwin . Where 's Kim ? [ Pants ] She didn 't make it . [ Yells ] VINCE : Rover One ! Go ! Now ! Go ! Go ! VINCE : Go ! [ Lane gasps ] Don 't try and pull it out . Your suit 's breached . Come on . Hurry up ! We need to get to the landing site , wait for the Aurora crew . Irwin , you drive . IRWIN : Shit . - Drive . Just drive . [ Sighs ] We need the med unit at base . Dream on . We don 't have the kit here to close that up . And you think they 'll just sit there and let you do that ? What is it , ten hours till the lander gets here ? How long have we got in this thing ? Irwin , I need power and O2 levels . IRWIN : OK . I 'm on it . We 'll be fine . We 'll hole up somewhere and we 'll wait it out . What 's the point in that ? Stop the infection before it takes hold . Give your body a chance to fight it . LANE : Vincent . I know . It 's okay . You 're gonna be okay . There 's not enough power to get to the landing site . Barely half of what we need . We 'd have to finish on foot . No . We have to go back . - What ? VINCE : We can 't go on foot . Lane 's hurt . We go back , we get her patched up . We can hold ' em off . - There are other options . - Like what ? Look , Irwin , if you 've got something to say , just say it . LANE : You think you should leave me behind because I might be infected ? That 's what you 're thinking , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? Lane , I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to help here . But you might be infected , too . Brunel touched you . Let 's see your neck . Go on , let 's see it . - Site Nine . - What ? We 've forgotten about Site Nine . Rover Two , it 's still there . It 's nearly fully charged . There 's enough power to make it to the landing site . [ Beeping ] VINCE : Looks like they 're following our tracks . Let 's get going . Shit ! VINCE : Shut down the airlock and auxiliary cabin power . [ Beeping ] Alright . Battery 's in the red . This better work . VINCE : I 'm gonna go check it out . I suppose there 's no point in saying be careful . No . I was planning on taking a lot of unnecessary risks . Just don 't go anywhere without me . No , I 'll go . I have some serious making up to do . Let me do this . Please . [ Beeping ] VINCE : Irwin , do you copy ? I 'm here . Vincent , I can hear . Keep your eyes open . If you see anything move , haul ass back . OK . [ Sighs ] [ Door creaks ] [ Beeping ] VINCE : Irwin , can you hear me ? You okay ? Come on , Irwin . Can you power it up or not ? Talk to me , Irwin . What 's going on ? IRWIN : Are we on a private channel ? Why ? IRWIN : How 's Lane ? - What do you mean ? She 's infected , Vincent . You need to get out of there . It 's not gonna happen . I want you to forget about it . Vincent , you 're my friend . But you 're not thinking clearly about this . Do you think this is about me trying to save my own skin ? I 'm trying to save both of us . It 's too late for her , Vincent . I 'll give you three seconds to get back here . Just leave her ! - One . Two . - You 're gonna get yourself killed . - For fuck 's sake ! - Three . Irwin 's lost it . I 'm going out there . [ Sobs ] [ Gasps ] VINCE : Irwin ! I know you can hear me ! Don 't do anything stupid . Irwin ! No ! Irwin ! Wait ! Irwin , please , man . Oh , fuck ! LANE : Vincent , they 're coming . Shit . We gotta get outta here . Now ! 80 degrees east . Into the storm . It 'll hide our tracks . We 've gotta lose 'em before the lander . LANE : Battery power is dropping . [ Thunder ] So they enter our orbit in eight hours . That is if they come down immediately without waiting to hear from us . - So what are our options ? - I don 't know . Wait for dawn . The sun should charge the battery in about an hour , give us enough juice to make it to the landing site . And what if they track us down before then ? Then we 'll just have to run them over and over and over - until they stop getting up . - And waste the last of our power . - That is such a shit plan , Vince . - I know . You got anything better ? Do you think they still feel ? No . Not like us . Oh , God . I 'm so thirsty . Do we have any water left ? Yeah . Let me check . We get to the lander , they 'll have a direct line to mission control . They can help . And I always took you for a pessimist . Yeah , well , I like to keep ' em guessing . I keep thinking about Brunel . I could see him fighting it . I keep wondering if he 's still in there . Trapped inside his own body , with no control . Sounds like hell to me . Do you think any part of us survives after death ? I don 't know . That 's a little bit above my pay grade . [ Beeping ] Lane ? MAN : This is Aurora broadcasting on all emergency channels . If there is anyone out there , we 're sending an emergency team to help . Please respond . Please respond . This is Campbell to Aurora lander . Campbell to Aurora lander . Come in , Aurora lander . [ Static ] Come on . Lane ? Lane ? Shit . Come on , come on . Lane . Lane , can you hear me ? Lane , come in ! [ Lane pants ] LANE : Stay back . Stay back . No . I 'm not gonna do that . You know I can 't do that . LANE : Oh , please . I can 't stop it . I can 't stop ... Lane , listen to me . We 'll find a way . Okay ? I promise you . We 'll find a way . Just stop , please . Please , Lane , just stop . No . Come on , come on . [ Beeping ] - Lane ! Stop ! - [ Lane wheezes ] VINCE : Wait ! Stop ! Stop ! Please ! Just stop . LANE : You 'll get out and walk in the end . On green grass . Under blue skies . Won 't you ? VINCE : We will . We will . I really wanted to , Vincent . I really ... I really did want to . Lane , listen to me . Just wait . - I 'm so sorry . VINCE : Just stop . Please ! I 'm sorry . No ! [ Gasps ] Lane . [ Gasps ] Shit ! No ! No ! Lane , no . [ Sobs ] No ! No , please . Please . Lane . [ Sobs ] No . [ Sobs ] No ! [ Vince screams ] No ! Lane ! Don 't ! Lane ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Stop ! No ! - Stop ! - Kill me . Please ! Kill me . Kill me . [ Sobs ] MAN : Responding to your Mayday . Approaching touchdown . Please make contact . MAN : Altitude descending . MAN : This is Aurora . Approaching touchdown . WOMAN : We have no response from Campbell . MAN : 600 . 400 . WOMAN : Prepare for breach conditions . VINCENT : Shit . MAN : This is Aurora lander . We 're touch down on Mars WOMAN : Roger . System check . MAN : 29 percent fuel capacity . All crew to prepare for exit . Pressure checks complete . Immediate ground reconnaissance . WOMAN : Cabin pressure cross check . Aurora lander , please respond . WOMAN : OK , prepare rear hatch for exit . Aurora lander , please respond . Do not open your bay doors . WOMAN : Hatch lowering . - Repeat , do not open your bay doors . WOMAN : We have ground contact . Channel Nine clear for contact . - Irwin , no ! WOMAN : Emergency code seven . Stay outta there ! No ! WOMAN : We have two unidentified figures . MAN : I 'm going out to meet them . WOMAN : Something isn 't right . They 're not responding to our transmissions . MAN : We have two unidentified figures . WOMAN : Go to seven , go to seven . Right now ! MAN : Fuck , what the ... MAN 2 : Help me ! WOMAN : Stay back ! Captain ! MAN 2 : Oh , Jesus ! MAN : Oh , God , no ! Help ! Help ! [ Screaming ] [ Beeping ] [ Slurping ] [ Growls ] Oh , fuck . Marko . [ Bay door closes ] My little girl . I can 't remember her name any more ... to say goodbye . Ella . Her name is Ella . I wanna feel again , Vincent . I can 't feel my hands . I can 't let you do this , Irwin . We can 't let this get back to Earth . It has to end here . [ Engines power up ] [ Roars ] [ Yells ] [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] [ Engines accelerate ] [ Yells ] [ Yells ] [ Yells ] [ Beeping ] [ Exhales ] [ Mouths ] You 're gonna be okay . [ Gasps ] Aurora lander to mission control . This is chief systems officer Vincent Campbell speaking . I don 't know how much you guys know but , er ... The entire crew of Tantalus base was infected by some sort of virulent bacteria . As far as I know , the Aurora relief team was lost as well . [ Sighs ] They 're gone . All of them . Lander 's in a stable orbit but I don 't have enough fuel to reach the Aurora . I 've got the , er , supplies on board for the Tantalus 's replacement crew . There 's a chance they might last long enough for you to send someone out here , but ... [ Chuckles ] Here 's the catch . There 's a , er pretty good chance I 'm infected , too . If that 's the case , I 've got just enough fuel left to drop out of orbit and burn up in the atmosphere . At least it 'll be quick . You should get this in about 15 minutes , so ... Er ... I guess I 'll be waiting . 511 Zulu , Aurora lander out . [ Slow beeping ]

 original uploader for this subtitle : YIFY Get Charlie . Dr. Holloway ! Charlie ! What ? Come quick ! - Did you date it ? - Thirty-five thousand years . Maybe older . You gotta be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . it 's gotta predate the others by millennia . I think they want us to come and find them . Yeah . What happened to that man ? He died . Why aren 't you helping them ? They don 't want my help . Their God is different than ours . Why did he die ? everyone does . Like Mummy ? Like Mummy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Heaven . Paradise . it 's someplace beautiful . How do you know it 's beautiful ? That 's what I choose to believe . Ellie ? David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this articulation is attested in the lndo-European descendants as a purely paralinguistic form it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennia or more . Let 's attempt Schleicher 's fable . Repeat after me . Perfect . - Mr . Lawrence ? - Yes ? sir . - Thank you . You do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood ! you 're a philosopher . And you 're barmy . it hurts . then ? is not minding that it hurts . William Potter is not minding that it hurts . William Potter is not minding that it hurts . Attention : Destination threshold . Attention : Destination threshold . Attention : Destination threshold . Robe . How long ? 18 days ... 15 minutes . Any casualties ? ma 'am ? Has anyone died ? ma 'am . Everyone is fine . then wake them up . Dr. Shaw . My name is David . Your mind and body are in a state of shock as a result of the stasis . It 's all right . Perfectly normal . Ellie . baby . there . Drink plenty of water . Drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . consume shakes with high caloric content . What the hell is that ? It 's Christmas . We need the holidays to show time is still moving . Mission briefing ... captain . Might wanna make your way down . I haven 't had any breakfast yet . is this seat taken ? Biology . Nice to meet you . Okay . but I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . I 'm here to make money . You got that ? Okay . I bet a hundred credits it 's a terraforming survey . they would tell us . they 're not telling us shit . Come on . you 're on . El . - l 'll try to keep my feet on the ground . - l know you will . Good morning . For those of you I hired personally it 's nice to see you again . I am Meredith Vickers . It 's my job to make sure you do yours . then . On with the show . Weyland Corporation . Building better worlds . friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . 2091 . And if you 're watching it you have reached your destination . And I am long dead . May I rest in peace . There 's a man sitting with you today . His name is David . And he is the closest thing to a son I will ever have . he is not human . He will never grow old and he will never die . And yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts for that would require the one thing that David will never have . A soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating the questions : Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when we die ? And I have found two people who convinced me they 're on the verge of answering them . if you would please stand . they 're in charge . The Titan Prometheus wanted to give mankind equal footing with the gods ... he was cast from Olympus . the time has finally come for his return . please . The floor is yours . wow . All right . I never had to follow a ghost before . let me show you why you guys are here . These are images of archeological digs from all over the Earth . That 's ... Babylonian . then Mesopotamian . this one here is our most recent discovery . 000-year-old cave painting from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . These are ancient civilizations . They were separated by centuries . and yet ... . The same pictogram ... pointing to the stars was discovered at every last one of them . And the only galactic system that matched was so far from Earth that there 's no way ... ancient civilizations could have possibly known about it . But itjust so happens that that system has a sun a lot like ours . there seemed to be a planet . Just one planet with a moon capable of sustaining life . And we arrived there this morning . So you 're saying we 're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave. is that right ? - No . - Yeah . an invitation . From who ? We call them Engineers . Engineers ? Do you mind telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . so do you have anything to back that up ? if you 're willing to discount ... that 's ... . But how do you know ? I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors . Miss Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins . nice place . It 's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support . food . Anything Miss Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment . so she lives on a lifeboat . Yes . I do . I like to minimize risk . why don 't you make the doctors a drink ? I 'll take a vodka . Up . look . It 's a Pauling Med-Pod . They only made a dozen of these . Miss Shaw . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expensive piece of machinery . It does bypass surgery . What do you need it for ? There might be some confusion about our relationship . Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission . But I 'm fairly certain your Engineers are scribblings of savages living in dirty little caves . and you do find these beings down there you won 't engage them you won 't talk to them . You will do nothing but report back to me . is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and bring you . Mr. Holloway we 'd happily be pursuing your agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . But if we can 't make contact why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer onboard . Cheers . So no response ? no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . David ? I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages to their roots. I 'm confident I can communicate with them provided your thesis is correct . " Provided it 's correct . " That 's good . doctor . What are you smiling about ? take her down . captain . Descent trajectory mapped . How we doing ? Great . boss . All personnel this is the captain . Brace for entry . captain . Vickers . All systems online . What is the atmosphere ? Atmosphere is 71 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen traces of argon gas . that 's weather . Just like home . If you 're breathing through an exhaust pipe . CO2 is over 3 percent . you 're dead . Peak portside . 000 ! It makes Everest look like a baby brother . take us around . We 'll use that as our point of entry . Terrain data rezzing up . We 've got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . no heat source . Nobody 's home . There is nothing in the desert and no man needs nothing . What was that ? Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots . Going through . Nice and slow . boys . There . what are you doing ? why don 't you take a seat ? Right there . God does not build in ... this valley ! Captain could you put us down there ? I wouldn 't be any good if I couldn 't do that . starboard 90 degrees . port bow . Engage landing sequence . Switch to manual . - Commence landing . - Easy . yeah . Bringing her down in five . - Preparing RCS thrusters . - Four . Two . Easy does it . Generator systems are inactive . Temperature is at 2.724 K. would you tell the survey team to suit up and meet us in the airlock . Only six hours left of daylight . no . captain and I want to open my presents . boy . You 're coming with us . I 'd be delighted . Attention : Ramp will open in five minutes . Jackson what 's that for ? Expedition security . My job is to make sure everybody is nice and safe . This is a scientific expedition . No weapons . then . Good luck with that . man ? I beg your pardon ? remember ? So why wear a suit ? I was designed like this because you people are more comfortable interacting with your own kind . it would defeat the purpose . huh ? I hope . Attention : Ramp will open in 15 seconds . Ramp will open in five ... one . Hey . This is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? You ready to do this ? I know you are . Fifield . I want a spectrograph on this . I want to know if it 's natural or if somebody put it there . I can 't tell you if it 's natural or not . But what I can ... it 's hollow . are you seeing this ? Affirmative . We see it . ready ? - Yeah . - Let 's do it . - After you . - After you . Okay . Careful . we 're going in . Copy that . What 's back here ? Some kind of a corridor ? let 's get a grid of the structure . I want the whole interior . If there 's anything in here worth looking at these pups 'll find them . " Pups " ? pups . My pups . we are now mapping . Copy that . I 'll be damned . you got a read ? Yeah . Pups are saying this way . Look at this . Charlie . Jesus . The sunlight is heating the water . Check out the humidity . and look at the CO2 levels . Outside ... and in here there 's nothing. lt 's breathable . What are you doing ? - Don 't be an idiot . - Don 't be a skeptic . There 's something generating an atmosphere . David ? - Dr . Holloway is correct . - Cleaner than Earth actually . They were terraforming . Please don 't do- - l 'm not wearing this thing anymore . baby . Do you copy ? Do not remove your headgear . You crazy bastard . Connect our suit cameras if you want to continue watching this freak show . We are taking our helmets off . Copy that . Switching feeds . come on . Pay up . " Pay what " ? mate ... no . The bet was why we came here . I 'd pay . a hundred credits . Put it towards a lap dance with Miss Vickers . How about that ? It 's minus 12 in here . So why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it ain 't water . Maybe it 's Martian piss . That 's your scientific theory ? is it ? Mr. Biology ? it sure is collagenous . perhaps . Impressive . What was that ? David ? David ? What is that ? David ? Ellie ! What was that ? I 'm really glad we didn 't bring weapons . El . Let 's go . - Whose idea was that ? Keep up ! Come on ! Where did he go ? wait . There it is . There it is . There it is . Charlie . We found them . What do you mean " them " ? Ellie . It looks like a door and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch . They were right . What did you want them to be ? Wrong ? David please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . I 'm out of here . where are you going ? What ? I 'm just a geologist . I like rocks. I love rocks ! Now it 's clear you two don 't give a shit about rocks . But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead bodies . As I don 't really have anything to contribute in the gigantic dead body arena ... if you don 't mind . Anyone wanna ... hey ? You staying ? ship 's good . Yeah . Ship very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . Thank you . Pull yourself ... man . And I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long 's it been dead ? Two thousand years give or take . David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . Wait . We don 't know what 's on the other side . Oops . Sorry . Ford. lt 's the head . An amazing state of preservation . - We 'll take it in . - Yeah . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . Stop . Stop . Don 't touch it . Sorry . don 't touch anything . Sweating . Organic . no . the murals are changing . I think we 've affected the atmosphere in the room . do you copy ? the head ! help me bag the head ! - Boss . - What you got ? We got an incoming storm front . Silica and lots of static . This is not good . I see it . Ground crew this is Janek . I need you to hustle back right now . do you copy me ? I got 200-kilometer winds of airborne silica and enough static to fry your suit . sir . We need more time . I 'll be closing the outer doors in 15 minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . Charlie ! David ! We must leave now . This is just another tomb . David ! up . Let 's go ! easy . Careful . we are leaving ! Come on ! they 've already taken off . let 's go . Prometheus to ground crew . You 're running out of time . come on . Let 's go . Go faster ! Charlie ! The head ! no ! What are you doing ? Hatch closure ... - ... in five seconds . - Shit . hold on ! Goddamn it . Door closing . don 't move ! Charlie ! Grab my hand ! No ! Ellie ! Ellie ! Got it . Ellie ? You could 've compromised the mission . Not to mention almost killing yourself ! Are you all right ? Yes . David . My pleasure . it 's real good to have ... but where 's Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? - Get them up for me . - All right . Fifield . I don 't know. lt all looks the same to me . this is the captain . Listen up . Between the static electricity and the wind speed ... there ain 't no safe way to come get you . What ? so get your helmets on and stay warm until the storm passes . Captain can you get a message to the scientist and his zealot girlfriend ? You got a pen nearby ? I think we got it . Tell them I said ... themselves . Copy ? keep your head down and we 'll come get you in the morning . which way now ? All right . huh ? Sample is sterile . No contagion present . David . So are they all dead ? What ? Who ? Your Engineers . Are they all dead or aren 't they ? I don 't know . We just got here . Scan . Do you care if they 're dead ? Weyland cared . Dr. Shaw . Have a look at this . - That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . I think it 's a helmet . - Let 's see if we can lift it up . - We should be able to prize this open . It 's too heavy for us . David ? Careful . Like so . What is that on its head ? It looks like new cells . - ln a state of ... . - Change . Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stem line into the locus coeruleus ? I think we can trick the nervous system into thinking it 's still alive . - Thirty amps . - Okay . No more . Let me make an incision . Okay . 40 . 40 up . Did you see that ? - Yes . - Yep . See ? Go up another 10 . up 10 . Maybe it 's a little ... - ... too much . Go down 10 . - Okay . - Down 10 . - Down another 20 . I 'm trying . it 's not going down . Full down . Ford stop it . God . contain it ! Now ! Contain it ? Turn it off ! God . The smell ! look at that . Look at that . It 's getting worse . after all . take a sample . Let 's have a look . I will take care of it . understood. I 'm sorry . slightly premature . sir . Miss Vickers . David ? I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . What did he say ? I 'm sorry that 's confidential . So help me God I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it . What did he say ? He said : " Try harder . " ma 'am ? Genetic view . Okay . Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Okay . Compare it to the gene sample ? Yeah . Overlay . Processing . Processing . DNA match . my God . It 's us . It 's everything . What killed them ? Big things have small beginnings . Am I interrupting ? I thought you might be running low . but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . I almost forgot you 're not a real boy . I 'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone . don 't you ? Your question depends on me understanding what you hoped to achieve by coming here . What we hoped to achieve was to meet our makers . To get answers . Why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? Because we could . Can you imagine how disappointing it would be to hear the same thing from your creator ? I guess it 's good you can 't be disappointed . Yes. lt 's wonderful actually . May I ask you something ? Please do . How far would you go to get what you came all this way for ? Your answers . What are you willing to do ? Anything and everything . I 'd imagine . pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course they 're real . Jesus Christ. I mean ... . Look at the pile . Look how high up they are . It looks like ... okay ? this thing is opened up from the inside . Almost like it exploded . you know ? Well ... . right ? Fifield . This is Prometheus . What is your position ? this is Millburn . We are at 7-4-0 1-4-7-7 . Why ? Just got a ping about one click west of you . What do you mean " a ping " ? whatever that probe is picking up it 's not dead . It 's reading a life form . " a life form " ? is it- - ? is it moving ? I don 't think so . you 're obviously not seeing what we 're seeing here . you wouldn 't be talking about a ping . boys . Your signal has been coming in sporadically since the storm hit . That 's no good to us down here ! is it- - ? is it moving ? Are these things moving ? actually . Must be a glitch . " a glitch " ? boys . Sleep tight . Try not to bugger each other . " a glitch " ? what does he mean ? Wait . he said- - yeah ? - Yeah . we ... . do we ? no . Where are we gonna go ? East . east . life form . " What the fuck ? Based on the behavior of the subject in these holographic recordings we 're attempting to identify what caused the head to combust. I can 't help but wonder was there an outbreak here ? You rang ... - ... ma 'am ? - l have something important to tell you . What is that ? This is a rose that I had frozen with the champagne . I was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for . We did find what we came for . They were here . This is- - The most significant discovery in the history ... I know . it really is . But I wanted to talk to them . don 't you want to know why they came ? Why they abandoned us ? baby . Charlie . I have proof . Look . Their genetic material predates ours . We come from them . - You 're kidding me . - No . Okay . Okay . Okay. I guess you can take your father 's cross off now . Why would I want to do that ? Because they made us . And who made them ? exactly . We 'll never know . But here 's what we do know : That there is nothing special about the creation of life . Right ? Anybody can do it . right ? I can 't . I can 't create life . What does that say about me ? that 's not- - l didn 't mean- - l wasn 't talking about- - Children ? Us . hey . Hey . Hey . Elizabeth Shaw you are the most special person I have ever met in my life and I love you . Hey . How much longer will this take ? I don 't know . I 'm just a captain . by the way . I 'll have you know that this thing once belonged to Stephen Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? You know if you wanna get laid you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scan . I 'm trying to get laid . " right ? But it wouldn 't make sense why I would fly myself half a billion miles from every man on Earth ... would it ? Vickers . Vickers . I was wondering ... . Are you a robot ? My room . Ten minutes . if you can 't be with the one you love Love the one You 're with Love the one you 're with Millburn . What 's all this black stuff ? Gazpacho . is that tobacco ? is that tobacco in your respirator ? sure . Tobacco . I am ashamed to count you amongst us Fifield . Really . Millburn . - Yeah ? You see this thing ? What do you think this thing was ? Some kind of a god ? Something they worshiped ? What ? - lt kind of looks like- - - What 's that ? What the hell is that ? my God . Okay . Just stay calm . Stay quiet . I can handle this . baby . Hey . Prometheus . We have an elongate reptile-type creature . with transparent skin . And it 's beautiful . Okay ! Prometheus we have two . baby . look at the size of that . What is it ? - You need to stay calm . - What 's there to be calm about ? You need to stay calm because she is beautiful . What makes you think that 's female ? She 's a lady . Look ! Hey . She 's mesmerized . Come here . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay. lt 's okay . baby . You 're strong ! You should help me now . Get it off . man ! I ain 't touching that ! my God . - lt 's getting tighter . - l ain 't touching it ! for God 's sake ! you 're making it worse ! It 's tightening ! It 's tight- - lt 's breaking my arm ! Shit ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Shit ! my God ! Jesus ! It 's in my suit . Jesus Christ . you up ? what 's up ? but I can 't reach Millburn ... see if I can rustle them up . Okay . Any idea where they are ? Last time they radioed in was where you found your head . we 're coming . All right . you 're coming with me . Come on . boss . captain . captain ? One of them probes picked up a life form . Pops up every hour for a couple of seconds and then it 's gone . I can find the probe and fix it . Knock yourself out . doctors . Fifield ! Millburn ? come on down . are you alone ? Miss Vickers . Uplink your feed to my room . Copy . You son of a bitch . You cut me off . What is this ? - Charlie ? - l just tripped . you 're sick ! baby . Come on . Fifield ? Millburn ? Chance. I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . Dr. Shaw ? Yeah ? Do we have any idea what is oozing out of these vases ? No . They weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ? What ? Who is it ? Which one ? - Who is it ? - lt 's Millburn . - Ellie . - Don 't touch him . Hold on . honey . what 's wrong ? okay ? You know infections ... what do you see ? baby . you tell me what you see . my God . get over here . It 's okay . Janek ? - What ? - We have to go now ! What do you see ? what do you see ? Holloway 's sick . He 's not good . I see movement in his esophagus . baby . - No. I 'm okay . Janek ! Come over and help me ! get over there . What 's happening ? - l 'm okay . - Let 's go ! Help me with him . I got you . We 're gonna get you out of here . Prometheus ... - Watch your head . - Okay. I 'm okay . - Holloway . - Get him up . come in . is anyone there ? This is Vickers . I need a medical team standing by the airlock . Full quarantine fail-safe . Holloway 's sick . Sick with what ? - Just do it . - Let 's get him back to the ship . - lt 's not safe down here . - Charlie ? I 'm suiting up . talk to me . - Move ! people ! We 've gotta move ! We 've gotta move ! Ellie ! He don 't look too good . Did he catch something down there ? We had our helmets off . I don 't know . this is Janek . Make sure that back door is open . captain . God. I 'm so sorry . Come on ! Please ! Prometheus ! Why is that door not open ? that is an order ! Get that goddamn door open ! it 's not . Come on ! help me ! it 's Janek . Open that back door right now ! Hold that door ! Prometheus do you copy ? open that door ! That is an order ! Open it . What the hell is this ? He 's not coming onboard . this is a sick man . I see that . That 's why he 's not coming on ! Charlie ! get over here ! Please ! We can still help him ! Help yourself . Everybody but Holloway back on this ship ! I won 't leave him ! Then stay ! Wait ! We could put him on the Med-Pod ! Please don 't do this . Ellie . Vickers ! What are you doing ? baby . - l love you . - No . stay back ! Do it . Stay back ! Charlie ! - Do it . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Charlie ! No ! My deepest condolences . I 'm going to have to take this . It may be contaminated . we were all exposed . You need- - We need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . of course . Yes ? I understand how inappropriate this is given the circumstances . But as you ordered quarantine fail-safes it 's my responsibility to ask . Have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? Since you and he were so close I want to be as thorough as poss- - my . You 're pregnant . What ? three months so . that 's impossible . I can 't be pregnant . Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? Yes but 10 hours ago . There 's no bloody way I 'm three months pregnant . doctor it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . I want to see it . Don 't think that 's a good idea . I want to see it . doctor ... . l want to see it . I want it out of me . We don 't have the personnel to perform a procedure like that . - Our best option- - - l want it out . Put you back into cryostasis until we return to Earth . get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please . It must be very painful . let me give you something . there . Someone will be along shortly to bring you back to Cryo Deck . It must feel like your God abandoned you . What ? To lose Dr. Holloway after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do you- - ? How do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Dr. Shaw ? We 're here to put you ... take you back to Cryo Deck go to beddy-byes . Dr. Shaw ? She 's doped . Prepare her . Emergency procedures initiated . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . I need a Caesarean . Error . This Med-Pod is calibrated for male patients and does not offer the procedure you have requested . Seek medical assistance elsewhere . Surgery . Abdominal . Penetrating injuries . Foreign body . lnitiate . Surgical procedure to begin . Running diagnostics . come on . Get it out ! Come on ! Please ! God ! - Come on ! - initiating anesthetics . Please ! Commence surgical procedure . God . God ! God ! God ! my God ! Come on ! Bridge to hangar . This is the captain . captain . - Can you see what I see ? Fifield 's monitorjust popped up . What ? Where ? it 's outside the goddamn ship . open the door ! do you copy me ? Come on in . Fifield ? Wait a second . Wallace . Take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? I 'm coming down there . you 're suiting up . - Come on . - Don 't let it on the ship ! Take him out ! Got him ! Do it ! Chance ? - Yes . Come on ! Get in the rover ! We gotta get out of here ! Go ! What is that ? You 've been asleep . You were on the ship all this time . Why ? I ... . l have a few days of life left in me . I didn 't wanna waste them until you could deliver what you promised . To meet my maker . sir . - Nice and clean . - Haven 't you told him they 're all gone ? Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? Turn me around . You convinced me that if these things made us then surely they could save us . please . anyway . Save you from what ? of course . Stand me up . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . sir . But you don 't understand . You don 't know . This place isn 't what we thought it was . They aren 't what we thought they were . I was wrong . We were so wrong . Charlie ... . Dr. Holloway 's dead . We must leave ! And what would Charlie do now that we 're so close to answering the most meaningful questions ever asked by mankind ? How can you leave without knowing what they are ? Shaw ? Okay . Okay . Come in . doc ? You know what this place is ? Those Engineers ? This ain 't their home . It 's an installation . Maybe even military . They put it out here because they 're not stupid enough to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit is in those vases . They made it here . it turned on them . The end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you want to know what they have to say ? I don 't care . Right . All you do is fly the ship . That 's right . captain . why are you here ? How about this ? No matter what happens down there I can 't bring none of that shit back home with us . Can 't let it happen . I 'll do whatever I have to to see that it doesn 't . captain . So you came after all . I thought you wanted me to . After all your attempts to stop me from coming here I 'm surprised to see you . It 's all right . Leave us . sir . If you 're ... you will die . Very negative way of looking at things . That 's exactly why you should have stayed at home . Did you really think I was gonna sit in a boardroom for years arguing over who was in charge while you go look for some miracle on some godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? A king has ... and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That is the natural order of things . Anything else ? No Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . Sorry . Poor choice of words . Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland is not around to program you ? I suppose I 'll be free . You want that ? " Want " ? Not a concept I 'm familiar with . That being said doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . Dr. Shaw . So pleased you could join us . sir . What ? The air is perfectly breathable . Are you sure ? Positive . Wait . We still don 't know how Holloway got infected. lf it 's in the air . It 's not . How do you know that ? Smells fine to me . - Shall we ? - Please . The bridge is just up ahead . What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . Janek ? Are you seeing this ? Shaw ? Thousands . What the hell ? give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . Strip away the dome . bring it up . captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . no doubt . Their hypersleep chambers ... I trust . So they ... - ... were traveling somewhere . - l 've managed to work out the broad strokes . It 's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving before things went to pot . Leaving to go where ? Earth . Why ? Sometimes to create one must first destroy . David ? sir . Are you sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . And you can speak to him ? I believe I can . I 'm all right . David . just like he asked . Ask where they 're from . What are you doing ? Ask him what 's in his cargo . It killed his people . enough . - David . - You made it here and it was meant for us . Why ? shut her up . I need to know why ! What did we do wrong ? Why do you ... - ... hate us ? - She opens her ... shoot her . continue . Tell him why I came . No ! Ford ! Move ! There 's nothing . I know . Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . take us home . no ! cap . What the hell was that ? Prometheus ! Come in ! is that you ? Copy . Janek listen to me . This ship is taking off ! - What ? - What is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! Shaw . We 're going home . if you don 't stop it there won 't be any home to go back to . and it 's headed for Earth . this is not a warship . - l know . Let 's go . I know that . But you must do it . let 's go ! please believe me ! Please ! I told you to get this ship going . Mr. Ravel . Warm up the ion propulsion . - What are you talking about ? - Sir . Burning ion in the atmosphere- - - Turns us into a bullet . That 's the point . - What are you doing ? This is my ship. I 'm telling you to take us home ! I 'll eject your module onto that surface . Two years of life . or you want to stay with me ? You got 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . You 're crazy . Gentlemen I can handle this myself . Feel free to join Miss Vickers . captain . You 're a shit pilot and you 're gonna need all the help you can get . if you can 't be with the one you love lf you think this means the bet 's off you 're wrong .

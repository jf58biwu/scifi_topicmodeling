 Oh , yeah , customized . Has a whole other meaning . Well , thanks for the lift home . That 's all right . It was on my way . Bay Ridge is on the way to highland ? I didn 't say I was on my way home . Oh . Booty call . The kids still call it that ? Well , whatever they 're calling it , I 'm not getting any . Run the beater . Are you seriously racial profiling ? Nah . I 'm curb creature profiling . He 's trying too hard not to look around , but he keeps checking the mirror every five seconds . All right . Car and plate are a match . Registration 's up to date . No warrants . Maybe your radar 's off . Hang on . It jammed up . Call it in . We have shots fired at 422 nevins . Perps are in a yellow taxi . Medallion number 9227 . That wasn 't a mistake , was it ? No . Let 's see what they did on the inside . Don 't bother . Get the door . Players must have found another way out . Almost all of ' em . He 's Harold Karr . Still holds the title to the building . Occb knew him right away . Old-school high roller . Most likely this was his game . Yeah , perps must have thought so . They put him on his feet and moved him to the safe . Looks like he had other ideas . Getaway driver is Shawn Lucas . He 's driving his sister 's car . Had a couple of robbery priors , but not much else . Perps dumped the cab at wyckoff and gates . They left the guns behind . They were wearing gloves . No prints , no leads . Uhuh . We 've got seven leads . Seat one ... Chips stacked neat , low , symmetrical rows . Professional male , tight with his money . Drinking water out of a glass , not a bottle . Older , conservative . He 's not gonna take a cab or walk , so check with the high-end car services . Seat two . Low on chips , but he 's got ' em stacked high , like he 's making a show . He wants you to think he 's a tough guy . Left his jacket when he ran . Brioni pocket square . - Wise guy wannabe ? - Yep . Like gotti used to wear . I 'll make some calls . Seat three . Kept his chips in a messy pile . He 's young , aggressive . He 's not worried about money because he 's got a ton of it . Look at his card protector . It 's heavy , real gold . Could I see that for a second ? This is super bowl swag from 2007 . All the giants got one of these . 1 : 15 left . Manning throws it downfield to David tyree , who catches it with one hand . And pins it to his helmet . Man , Brady cried like a little girl . You finished ? I had box seats . This here ... This is the pro . Half of the money in the game is his . See these chips , how they 're stacked ? That 's from shuffling them , 20 at a time . He 's drinking water , not booze . He 's here to win , not socialize . Now , check out the floor . He 's wearing out that carpet . If he 's winning , why is he so nervous ? Speed . These guys play 24 , 48 hours at a time . The perps murdered two men tonight ... One because he didn 't move fast enough , the other just to keep us from talking to him , but they left empty-handed . Think they 'll go again ? Unless we find them first . Does this look familiar to you ? It ain 't mine . Oh , that must be my mistake . Teddy , is this yours ? - I thought it was yours . - No , not mine . You know what ? Has anybody in this room played in a super bowl ? Maybe that 's gonna help us figure this one out . It 's a good question . I have not played in the super bowl . Have you ? No , not me . What do you guys want ? Giants are in Dallas this week to play the cowboys . Three players are home with injury . Only one of them played in the super bowl in ' 07 . Got one of these . Right . So unless you want your coach to find out how you been recuperating ... Illegal gambling is just the first thing that comes to mind ... Murder being the second . I did not kill Harry . I liked Harry . Right , which is why you left his dead body at the table , turned tail , and ran like a punk . Harry went right at that guy . When the gun went off , everybody ran . Sit down . Buddy Rovner was the first out the back . It 's not hard to guess why . Okay , so guess . These games are invitation only . With Harry 's , you didn 't know where it was till 24 hours before . Only a player knew enough to set it up . So why Rovner ? Other game got robbed last month . I heard buddy was at that one too . Hey . 74 squad is bitching about your hijacking their homicide ? Hey , I was shot at . Holly was shot at . The perps are mine . - Do you like someone ? - It 's only been 12 hours . It 's already been 12 hours . Holly , you get in touch with the Vic 's family ? He didn 't have any . - Interviewed his secretary . - And ? Ever hear someone with nothing bad to say about someone work really hard to find something good to say ? Harry Karr lost more than he won , but I get the impression the poker games weren 't about the money so much as him having someone to talk to . Make sure you let the M.E. Know . No one claims him , they have to dispose of the body . The guy was friends with every high roller in the city , and they 're just going to bury him in Potter 's field ? Well , with friends like those ... Be there in a sec . Hey . What the hell was that about ? - What ? - You pushed me out of the way . You were about to get tackled by a professional . Okay , listen . You stand your ground , and I 'll stand mine , okay ? Hey , in my office . - Look , sarge ... - Close the door . That happen a lot ? - What ? - You protecting Teddy . No . He carries his weight ? - He 's a good partner ? - Yep . Would you tell me if he wasn 't ? No . Get out of here . Yes , sir . That wire secure ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Don 't " yeah , yeah " me . Now you want to buy one deck of heroin . If he tries to sell you weed ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm there to buy one deck of heroin . I got it . Don 't let him get you inside . They try to get you inside , you walk away . Hold up , hold up . I know I 'm the new guy , but I don 't need lessons on how to buy drugs in Harlem . I got that one , all right ? Okay . Seems like you got it under control . Watch and learn , baby . Dick . Eight seats , we got five I.D. - Six . Harold Karr . - Vics aren 't witnesses . Four of them we 've interviewed . They all say the same thing ... Two guys with masks and shotguns . Harold Karr would not open the safe . All of them say buddy Rovner set it up . Buddy Rovner ... Won the world series of poker when he was 21 . Cash prize of over $ 2 million . So why is he taking on games ? Well , according to vanity fair , Rovner developed a nasty little drug habit , a pile of debt , and a losing streak as long as the Macy 's day parade . His residence of record is in Las Vegas , but he hasn 't been there in seven months . These guys bounce around the world , chasing games , and listening to the voices in their head ... They also get used to staying in the most expensive hotels in the world . Start with chains who also own casinos in ac and Vegas . If he 's a whale , he 's being comped . He 's in the penthouse . Okay . Brioni pocket square . You recognize either one of them ? No . But they took me off of the mob kids newsletter when I went into the academy . I saw two uniforms outside . Go , go , go get ' em . I 'll see you upstairs . Hey , going up ? Excuse me , guys . Penthouse ? You going to the penthouse ? That ... that 's fancy . Y 'all from New York ? 'Cause it 's crowded , a lot of traffic . Hey , what y 'all think about that ... That new bike-share program ? You don 't use it , do you ? Damn , this ... This is not my floor . Nah , I am not on the fourth floor , I 'm on the tenth floor . I don 't know what I was thinking about there . Wait , that was Orlando . That was Orlando . I don 't know what I was thinking . I was in Orlando when I was on the tenth ... I was not on the tenth flo ... I was not on the tenth floor . It 's the 14th floor . Or was it the 20th floor ? Sorry , guys . We 'll take the stairs . Oh , what , hey . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , back up , back up , back up . Now , you think Rovner tried to rip you off , and you 're mad . And I totally get and respect mad , trust me . But right now there are about five or ten other cops upstairs waiting for you . And I 'm betting you don 't have permits for those pieces I saw bouncing up and down under your coats from halfway across the lobby . So ... how do you want this to go down ? Turns out ... they were in the wrong hotel . Yes , in the shoe . - Buddy Rovner ? - Uh ... This isn 't what it looks like . Okay , I guess it is what it looks like . I was just playing my game , you know , trying to fix my leaks . I 'm dealt 10-Jack , suited , under the gun . So instead of just check , holding , I open up the pot , and bump it up to four grand . Only ATM 's keep 10-Jack under the gun . So , why don 't we skip to the part where someone gets shot . Is that watch real ? - What ? - Isn 't it a bit um ... Hypocritical , for a cop to be wearing a Balenciaga knock off . It 's not a knock off . $ 100 it 's a knock off . You watch someone get murdered , and your first reaction , is to have a Hooker party , at the grange . We all grieve differently . On the elevator up to see you , I met a couple of guys . Bruised knuckles , bent noses , and marinara stains on their shirts . Word 's out that 's the second time you showed up at a game , and it got robbed . Yeah , it 's time for me to get on a plane . You 're not getting on a plane . You 're getting lost in the system for five or six days on drug charges . Meanwhile , I call the post . They do a " where are they now ? " Story on a guy that shows up at games that get robbed . After that , good luck running far enough or fast enough , or finding a game that 'll even have you . - Yeah , you 'd do that to me ? - Oh , you ... You have no idea what I would do to you . Okay , what do you want me to say ? What do you want to tell me ? You got to stay in long enough to get out . You know what I mean ? No . Maybe I 'm buying some , uh , some supplements from this guy , Gus . I tell him about a game I 'm in . It 's just a conversation , right ? There 's no bad thoughts in my head . Then I 'm at the game , and these two guys come in . And they hold us up ... Masks . But I recognize Gus . I don 't say anything . I mean , I 'm running out of cash , so I say nothing . And the next time I see him , Gus hands me a bag of red supplements , and , um , kicks me back my stake , plus 10 . So maybe ... Maybe you tell Gus where the next game is . I 'm right on the edge on a comeback , but I keep running out of capital before the cards come . I mean , you see a chance to go back to being somebody that you liked being ... I mean , what wouldn 't you do ? Gus Benson ... Fought in a few undercards , lost his license over some drug collars , and now he owns a gym in red hook . Go take a look at him . You got it . Do you think I can handle it ? I mean , maybe I should wait in the car so I don 't get hurt . Yeah , maybe you should . What 's up with them ? Sibling rivalry . They 'll work it out . Yeah , yeah , like Cain and Abel . I 'm here to see Makasi . I need a deck . You Rafael 's friend ? Yeah . We grew up together in Santiago . I 'm Makasi . Come in . We lost visual . All right . - You ever sparred before ? - Yeah , once or twice . Do you think we need headgear ? Nah , not a big deal . Hey . - You got to keep your guard up . - Okay . Are you at least watching the guy ? Yeah . You wanna take it easy ? Gotta make it look convincing . Okay , let 's rock and roll . Hold on , where 'd he go ? What ? Wow . Okay . Yeah , you got to make it look convincing . Come on . Hold up , hold up , hold up . Okay , okay , wait here , wait here . I 'll give you three for the price of two . Going out of business sale ? Yeah , something like that . You know anyone who wants to buy a gym ? He 's in bad shape . Not bad yet , just pliant . We 're gonna need him to be like that . You want to feel sorry for someone ? Feel sorry for Harold Karr . This kid put himself in this position . That 's probably what someone was saying about Harold Karr . You ever think about who 's gonna be at your funeral ? I spent four months in a hospital bed thinking about not much else . I don 't think about it anymore . I 'll get him some coffee . It might take the edge off a little . That guy look like he 's here to train ? Now , the second big guy here is Orville lambert . Most of the fights he 's won he 's been arrested for . Benson and lambert could be the two who shot at us , right ? Mutt and Jeff combo . I know chunk style here . That 's nesto Perez . Deals guns . They 're tooling up . They 're gonna go again . Right . From what Benson said , I think it 's gonna be their last one , too . Then they 're gonna get out of here . - So we roll them up . - For what ? A couple of guns , if we 're lucky ? Hope they confess to a double murder ? Nah , nah . We got to catch 'em dirty , at a game . I need to put someone on the inside . - I 'll do it . - You own a suit ? - Yeah . - Nah . I don 't mean something you bought at Joseph a . Banks for 45 bucks . I mean something that says you can lose 25 gs in a night . Guess I 'm out . I 've got something . I 'm sure you do . I have to assume they got a good enough look at us at nevins street . It 's not worth the risk . So do we get around to me , or do we have to ask the janitor 's availability first ? I didn 't hear you volunteer . I am . I 'm volunteering . Yeah , what you got ? This is my world . I know these people . I-I was one of these people . You know anything about poker ? Yeah , enough to lose , which is the point , right ? Yeah . Yeah . So ... It looks like you 're up . Benson and lambert are about to hit it again we need to know where . I talked about a lot of games . Start with the regular ones . All right , tomorrow is actor night . Suite at the gansevoort , everybody brings their , uh , entourage . Big party . Too many people . There 's a game on Friday . Time Warner , top floor , all the New York pros . Cash ? Credit . All right , there 's a game tonight . In the financial district . It 's pretty conservative . You know , mainly abc poker , but plenty of cash . Can you walk me inside ? Why ? Why ? Why do you think ? So I can be there when you bust these guys ? Yeah , no thanks . Hey , how you feeling ? What what ? Well , your pupils , they 're starting to look normal again . I 'm thinking shakes setting in . I give you ten hours . Bouncing off four stone walls , eyeballed by a dozen degenerates , trying to choke down bologna sandwiches , because you 're that hungry . You 're tired , but you can 't sleep because your heart is pounding through your ears . I give you ten hours before you 're begging someone to get me on the phone . Is he always like this ? Two men wereilled over a game . Now , one was probably on his way anyhow , but the other one , this old guy brought you into his life , thinking you were his friend . Now , you want to race me to the high ground ? I 'm gonna need a change of clothes . All right . Let 's see it . Mm . We cool ? You want a drink ? - Nah . - Nah ? What , you got girls waiting for you or something ? Yeah , maybe . Okay . Forgetting something ? Nah . I 'm robbing you . Come on , man , we got to get in there . Ah , ah . Give it a second . - What ? - Let 's do this . We 're going in . Police ! Let me see your hands . Hands . Hands , now ! Get over here , come on . Man , you guys are stupid . You couldn 't tell he was a cop my niece , she 's four , she needs glasses . She could tell he was a cop . Bob ? Would you like to frisk these gentlemen ? You see , we were just gonna bust you for selling , but now we got to bust you for assault , too . Lots more work for us , and lots more jail time for you . That 's a hell of a way to get your cherry popped , Bob . We 're not bigfooting anything . My guy was at the scene . You don 't like it ? Then take it to the chief of ds . And , frankly , a guy with your clearance rate shouldn 't be begging to take on more murders . I need to set up an undercover . I need an esu team , some good wires , - $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 . - You 're welcome , Bob . Getting the tting the sever off your ass was my pleasure . I got an idea where the poker game shooters are going to hit next . So now you want me to tell operations you want to use innocent civilians as decoys ? They 're already in danger , and they 're not that innocent . I 'm gonna have somebody in the game , make sure none of the victims get stupid . Who ? Teddy ? Was that a question or a statement ? He fits the profile . But ? Oh , man . So much easier when it was just me and Gary . One of us went through the door , and the other one covered his back . And now you got to send someone else through the door . Not so much fun being a boss , is it ? Being responsible for someone other than yourself ? I hate it when you call me a boss . And I love calling you one . This Teddy kid ... He 's good . A lot of potential . But that doesn 't make him ready . It 's your call , but ... But if you never send him in , he 's never going to be ready . You gonna approve this , or what ? Like I really have a choice here ? All clear . You owe housekeeping a pretty serious tip , my friend . What , you guys gonna watch me get dressed ? Leave the door open . The bathroom too ? Oh , come on , man , have you seen the toilets at the station ? There was no way that was going to happen . I could use a shower . Open . You know who digs the trenches at Potter 's field ? Rikers island inmates . I don 't see you as the kind who gets wrapped up in someone dying lonely . I don 't see myself as that kind either . You know what I gave up to take this job . Most of my family is on the other side . Mine too . I guess I never thought of it as " gave up . " More like " walked away from . " What , you see something , sarge ? Look at the position of the body . You were right . Harold Karr makes eight witnesses . Hey . If that 's what $ 1,000 suit looks like , I think you got robbed . It 's what a $ 2,000 suit looks like . But on you , it 'd probably look like 250 . Hey , buddy ? Buddy ? If you 're doing anything in that shower other than ... He 's in the tub . Hey ! Hey , buddy ? I need an ambulance . - What the hell ? - It 's on me . I tossed the whole place before I let him in . It 's not his fault . I had it stashed in the drain pipe . You got to hide ' em , otherwise the hookers steal ' em . I learned that lesson the hard way . How long you been doing speed , three or four years ? You knew what you were doing . I would have choked in that game , got your guy killed . So you took the noble way out ? You think I buy that ? Every day I 'm breathing , I 'm playing . I can 't help myself . Call the d.A. See if we got enough for a warrant on Benson and lambert . We 'll pick ' em up , see if we can break them . Buddy 's next to useless as a witness . Even it he wasn 't , you and I both know that he doesn 't give us a case . You got a better thought , detective ? Stick with the plan . I can talk my way in . What if you can 't ? The one thing I do know how to do is to talk my way into money . What do we lose by taking a shot , huh ? Looks like that hurts . Maybe next time I say , " don 't go inside , " you won 't go inside . You set me up . Come again ? You knew he wouldn 't do the deal outside . Well , then you should have walked away . We 're here . What do you got ? We 've seen a few people coming in and out . Esu is down the block , ready to move on our signal . All right . It 's a working phone . It 's also a wire , always transmitting . Be anything goes wrong , say , but you order a 7 and 7 , e . We come in . How about a Martinez ? - What ? - It 's a Martinez . It 's the forerunner to the Martini . It 's got old tom gin , two dashes of maraschino liqueur ... 7 and 7 . Right . We 've got the advantage here . We know Benson and lambert 's m.O. : Arrive late , collect the money . When everybody 's getting tired , bust their way in . You let the robbery happen . Mmhmm . Pay attention to details . Keep the players safe . Don 't let anyone do anything stupid . Don 't you do anything stupid . - Yeah , yeah . - Don 't you " yeah , yeah " me . No , I 've got it under control . All right . I 'm here for the game . I 'm with Rovner . Then you wait for Rovner . He 's gonna be late . Then so are you . Uh , he 's getting girls , so , I mean , I can tell him to bring one more , if you want . I mean , once the game begins , what are you going to do all night , huh ? Smart . Smart ? I like a girl who looks smart . Smart . I got it . I 'm not here to supervise , just observe . Okay , I did sign for $ 25,000 in cash . All right . One guy on the door ... armed . Not taking any chances . The game 's on the fourth floor . Elevator when you come in , and the stairs are in the back on the left . Excuse me ? Hello ? Is there a problem ? No . No , no , no , no . You okay ? Hey , guys . Any sign of Benson or lambert ? Nothing . - Calling or folding ? - Re-raise , make it ten . Fold . What , you got your flush ? - How 's Teddy sound to you ? - I call . - He 's holding up . - That 's good . Call . We got lambert . He 's with a white male , 25 to 30 . Silver Camaro . He 's headed your way . Raise . Turn around . Turn ... around . Where 's Benson ? Why is lambert carrying two guns ? Damn it . Everyone get ready to move on my signal . We 're not waiting on Teddy ? Fold . Well , I need a drink . Let 's go . Let me see your hands ! Hands on the table , where I can see them . Get ' em on the table ! Hey , you , money now . Open the safe , or I start shooting people . Now ! Just open the safe . Don 't ... don 't do it . Hey ! What was that ? Lit wasn 't . You shook your head . I saw you shake your head . Tell me why you shook your head , or I 'm gonna blow it off . Everyone move , now . Go , go . Everyone , go . Get the ... come on ! Stand up . Stand up ! Slower . You two , get up ! Why 'd he shake his head ? Why 'd you shake your head ? Get the money ! I 'm gonna fix this for you . Hey . Get your gun down ! On the ground right now ! Put your gun on the ground ! Put it down ! On the ground ! Put your gun on the ground ! Get it down . Put your hands behind your back ! What the hell happened ? I didn 't give the signal . I-I didn 't make the call . No , I did . Well , you could have gotten someone killed . You could have gotten someone killed . Did you tell me Benson was on the inside ? I had it under control . I couldn 't . The minute you saw him , what were you supposed to do ? Ii was in there . That was my call . You were supposed to call it off ! Hey , kid . You want to prove yourself , stop trying to prove yourself . Am I right , or am I wrong ? You 're the boss . Number five . All right . Thanks . So that 's it ? I doubt it . For a minute there , I thought it was me . Thought I had misread you . Leaned too hard , but then I remembered I was dealing with a poker player . Yeah , you didn 't try to o.D. Because of me . You were playing the odds . Getting your stomach pumped against a gun in the face . You knew I ... so ? You knew I didn 't want to go . You didn 't want to go because Benson had already tried to kill you once . Amd Harry Karr wasn 't protecting the safe , was he ? Why would a lonely old guy who plays bad poker just for the company get himself killed over money ? He wouldn 't . If he saw you were about to get killed though , he might have gotten between the gun and you . Why ? Why would he do that ? Because he liked you . Because he thought you were his friend . Two , three games a year ... I barely knew him . You knew him better than most . - Hey . - Hi . Told the wife I 'm not coming home tonight . Let 's go get drunk . No , I got to finish something first . Let 's go get drunk first . Every assignment ... I 'm always the rich kid . You know , I run the bank statements and I talk to the trust fund babies , and it was supposed to be different here . It is . You 're my partner . Hey ! You sober up tomorrow morning , you still want to quit , we 'll go get drunk again . Hey , have you ever had a Martinez ? This one ? Yeah , thanks . It 's getting pretty dusty up there . Let it . Hey , you remember my first buy ? When you got the crap kicked out of you ? You knew I was walking into an ass beating . What , you want me to apologize now ? Man , you hold a grudge . How did you know I wouldn 't get myself killed ? Didn 't . You still let me go . It 's what you needed . And you 're a better cop now because of it . How 'd you make that call though ? Well , somebody 's got to be a surgeon 's first patient , right ? I might have screwed up today . I didn 't hear any new tragedies on the radio on the way over , so ... Couldn 't have screwed up that bad . You took your sweet time coming in . You had a lot to learn . You were probably eating . Mm . Probably . Where did you get these ?

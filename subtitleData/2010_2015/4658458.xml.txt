 Get Charlie . Doctor Holloway ! Charlie ! What ? Come quick ! maybe older . You got to be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . by a millennium . I think they want us to come and find them . Yes . What happened to that man ? He died . Why aren 't you helping them ? They don 't want my help . Their God is different than ours . Why did he die ? Sooner or later everyone does . - Like mommy ? Like mommy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Paradise ... it 's someplace beautiful . - How do you know it 's beautiful ? Cause that 's what I choose to believe darling ? David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this matter of articulation is attested ... in the Indo European descendants it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennia or more . let 's attempt Schleicher 's fable . Repeat after me : Perfect . Mr. Lawrence ? - Yes . sir . - Thank you . You 'll do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood . you 're a philosopher . And you 're balmy ! it hurts . then ? is not minding that it hurts . is not minding that it hurts . is not minding that it hurts . Attention ! Destination threshold ! Attention ! Destination threshold ! Attention ! Destination threshold ! Robe ! How long ? 15 minutes . Any causalities ? ma 'am ? Has anyone died ? ma 'am . Everyone is fine . Well then wake them up . Dr. Shaw . My name is David . as a result of stasis . it 's perfectly normal . Eli ? baby . Drink plenty of water . Drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . All crew . Consume shakes with high protein content . What the hell is that ? It 's Christmas . Need the holidays to sum time is still moving . Captain . Might wanna make your way down . I haven 't had my breakfast yet . Has this seat been taken ? Hi . I 'm Millburn . Biology . Nice to meet you . but ... I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . I 'm here to make money . You got that ? Okay . it 's a terraforming survey . No . If it 's a terraforming survey they would just tell us . they aren 't telling us shit . Come on . - Hundred . - Alright . You 're on . Eli . I 'm trying to keep my feet on the ground . - And there you will . - Good morning . it 's nice to see you again . and it is my job to make sure you do yours . then . On with the show . Weyland Corporations . Building better worlds . friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . 22 June 2091 . and I am long dead . May I rest in peace . There 's a man sitting with you today . His name is David . He is the closest thing to a son I 'll ever have . he 's not human . that David will never have . A soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating the questions : Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when we die ? who have convinced me they 're on the verge of answering . if you would please stand . they 're both in charge . he was cast from Olympus . the time has finally come for his return . please . The floor is yours . Uh - wow . Alright . Never had to follow a ghost before . Okay . Let me show you why you guys are here . These are images of archaeological digs from all over the Earth . then Mesopotamian . Now this one here is our most recent discovery . from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . and yet ... pointing to the stars was discovered at every last one of them . could have possibly known about . that system ... a lot like ours . there seemed to be a planet . and we arrived there this morning . is that right ? - No . - Yeah . not a map . An invitation . From whom ? We call them Engineers . Engineers ? You mind telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . do you have anything to back that up ? that 's ... wooh ! But how do you know ? Hmm ? I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors . Ms. Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins . Wow . Nice place . It 's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support . Air . Food . Anything Ms. Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment . so she lives on a life boat . Yes . I do . I like to minimize risk . why don 't you make the doctors a drink . I 'll take a Vodka . Up . look . It 's a Polling medpod . They only made a dozen of these . Ms. Shaw . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expense piece of machinery . It does bypass surgery . What do you need it for ? I think there might be some confusion about our relationship . are nothing but scribblings of savages living in dirty little caves . and you do find these beings down there . you 'll do nothing but report back to me . is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and to bring you here . we 'd happily be pursuing your agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . why did you ... why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer on board . Cheers . no response ? no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . David ? to their roots . provided you 're thesis is correct . Provided it 's correct . That 's good ! doctor . What are you smiling about ? let 's take her down . captain . - How we 're doing ? - Great . boss . this is the captain . captain . Vickers . All systems on line . What is the atmosphere ? - traces of argon gas . - Woh ! Now that 's weather ! Just like home . Only if you 're breathing through an exhaust pipe ! CO2 is over three percent . you 're dead . port side . Woh ! Fifty two thousand ! Makes Everest look like a baby brother . Alright . Take us round . We 'll use it as our point of entry . Plain data rising up . We got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . no feed source . Nobody 's home ! and no man is nothing . What was that ? Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Juice air speed by a hundred knots . Going through . Nice and slow . boys . There ! what are you doing ? why don 't you take a seat ? Right there . God does not build in straight lines . Starboard side ! This valley ! do you think you can put us down there ? I wouldn 't be any good if I couldn 't do that ! starboard . 90 degrees . port bow . Engage landing sequence ! System manual ! Commence landing ! - Down here . - Okay . Yeah baby ! four ... easy does it . and meet us in the airlock . There 's only six hours left of day light . Why don 't you leave it till the morning ? no ! and I wanna open up my presents . you 're coming with us . I 'd be delighted . Attention ! Ramp will open in five minutes . Jackson . What 's that for ? Expedition security . My job is to makes sure everybody nice and safe . This is a scientific expedition . No weapons . Alright then . Good luck with that . man ? I beg your pardon ? why wear the suit ? interacting with your own kind . it would defeat the purpose . huh ? Not too close I hope . Attention ! Ramp will open in 15 seconds . 1 . Hey . This is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? Wooh ! Come on ! You ready to do this ? I know you are ! Fifield . I want a spectrograph on the structure . alright ? I can 't tell you if it 's natural or not . it 's hollow . are you seeing this ? we see it . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let 's do it . - After you . - After you . Careful . we 're going in . - Copy that . What 's back here ? Some kind of a corridor ? let 's get a grid of the structure . I want the whole interior . these pups will find them . Pups ? pups . My pups . we are now mapping . Copy that . I 'll be damned . you got a read ? - Yeah . Pups are saying this way . Look at this . Charlie ! Jesus ! Sun light 's heating the water . Check out the humidity . look at the CO2 levels . there 's nothing . It 's breathable . What are you doing ? don 't be a skeptic . Right ? There 's something generating an atmosphere . David ? Dr. Holloway is correct . actually . They were terraforming here ! Eli ... don 't ! babe . Do you copy ? Do not remove your head gear ! Woo ! You crazy bastard ! if you want to continue watching this freak show . We are taking our helmets off . Copy that . Switching feeds . come on ! Pay up . Pay ? Pay what ? pay what ? Something manufacturing breathable air down there . it 's terraforming . no ! The bet was why we came here . then I pay . come on ! A hundred credits ! hey ? It 's minus 12 in here . why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it ain 't water . Maybe it 's Martian piss . Mr. Biology ? it sure is clean . Maybe it 's kind of residuum . Impressive . What was that ? David ? David ? What is that ? David ? Eli ! What the hell was that ? Aren 't we glad we didn 't bring weapons ? Eli . Let 's go . Who 's idea was that ? Come on ! Come on ! Where did it go ? Wait ! Wait ! There it is . There it is . Charlie ! We found them ! them ? Eli . and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch ! They were right . did you want them to be wrong ? David ... please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . No . No . I 'm out of here ! Fifield ! Where you going ? What ? I 'm just a geologist ! I like rocks ! I love rocks ! Now it 's clear you two don 't give a shit about rocks . in the gigantic dead body arena ! if you don 't mind . hey ? You staying ? - No . Ship 's good . - Yeah . Ship 's very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . Thank you . man . I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long has he been dead ? give or take . David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . Wait ! We don 't know what 's on the other side . Oops ! Sorry . Ford . It 's the head ! An amazing state of preservation . - We 'll take it in . - Yeah . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . Stop ! Stop ! Don 't touch it . It 's alright . don 't touch anything . It 's sweating . Organic . no ! the murals are changing ! I think we 've affected the atmosphere in the room . do you copy ? the head ! quickly help me bag the head ! - Boss . - What 'd you got ? We got an incoming storm front . Silica and lots of static . This is not good . I see it . this is Janek . I need you to hustle back right now ! do you copy me ? and enough static to fry your suit . sir . But we need more time here . I 'll be closing the outer doors in fifteen minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . Charlie ! David ! We must leave now ! This is just another tomb . David ! up ! Let 's go ! careful . we are leaving ! Come on ! Dammit ! They 've already taken off ! let 's go ! Prometheus to Ground crew ! You 're running out of time ! I repeat ! You 're running out of time ! Alright . Come on . Let 's go ! Go faster ! Charlie ! The head ! Eli ! No ! What are doing ? Hatch doors close in five seconds ! Shit . Damit ! Hold on ! - Goddamit . - Doors are closing ! Eli ! Don 't move ! Charlie ! Grab my hand ! No ! No ! Eli ! Eli ! I got it . Decontamination at level three . Eli ? Huh ? not to mention almost killing yourself ! Are you alright ? David . My pleasure . doctors . but where 's Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? - Keep them up for a while . - Alright . Fifield ! it all looks the same to me . this is the Captain . Listen up . there ain 't no safe way to come get you . What ? until the storm passes . can you get a message to the scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his ? Mmhmm . - You got a pen nearby ? - Nope . Nope . I think we got it . Tell them I said to fuck themselves . - Copy ? - Copy that . and we 'll come get you in the morning . - Which way now ? - Alright . Which way ? Okay . Sample is sterile . No contingent present . David . are they all dead ? What ? Who ? Your Engineers . Are they all dead or aren 't they ? I don 't know . We just got here . Scan . Do you even care they 're all dead ? Weyland cared . have a look at this . - That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . I think it 's a helmet . Let 's see if we can lift it up . - Yeah - Should be able to prise this open . It 's too heavy for us . David ? Careful . Like so . What is that on its head ? - in a state of ... - Change ! Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stemline into the locus coeruleus ? into thinking its still alive . Thirty amps . - Okay . - No more . Lightly making an incision . Okay . Go up forty . forty up . Did you see that ? see ! Go up another ten . up ten . You went a little bit too much . Go down ten . go down ten . Down another twenty . Yeah ... I 'm trying it 's up . - I 'm trying it 's up and down . - Go down . stop it ! my God ! now ! now ! God ! The smell ! Mortal after all . take a sample . Let 's have a look . sir . I will take care of it . sir . Understood . I 'm sorry . Unfortunately slightly premature . sir . Ms. Vickers ? David ? I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . What did he say ? that 's confidential . I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it ! What did he say ? He said ... try harder " . ma 'am ? - Genetic view . - Okay . Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Okay . - Compare it to the gene sample . - Yeah . Overlay . Processing . Processing . DNA matched . Oh my God . It 's us . It 's everything . What killed them ? Big things have small beginnings . Am I interrupting ? I thought you might be running low . pal . but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . huh ? Dr. Holloway . don 't you ? what you hope to achieve by coming here . What we hoped to achieve ? Was to meet our makers . To get answers . Why they ... why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? We made you cause we could . to hear the same thing from your creator ? huh ? it 's wonderful actually . May I ask you something ? Please do . to get what you came for all this way for ? your answers ? What would you be willing to do ? Anything and everything . That 's worth drinking to I 'd imagine . pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course they 're real ! Jesus Christ ! Look at the pile ! Look how high up they are ! it looks like they were running from something . okay ? Maybe those things opened up from the inside . It looks like it exploded . Looks like a scene out of some sort of holocaust painting . Whoa ... right ? This is Prometheus . what is your position ? this is Millburn . Uh ... why ? about one click west of you . a ping ? Well ... it 's reading lifeform . what do you mean a lifeform ? Is it ... is it moving ? No . I don 't think so . you 're uh ... you 're obviously not seeing what we 're seeing down here . yeah ? boys . since the storm hit . Captain ! Is it ... is it moving ? Are these things moving ? it just disappeared actually . a glitch ? boys . Sleep tight . Try not to bug each other . a glitch ? - Millburn ! Millburn ! - What do you mean ? Wait ! He said ... one click west . - Yeah . Now we ... do we ? Huh ? no ! - Where we gonna go ? East . East . man ! lifeform ! What the fuck ? we 're still attempting to identify what caused the head to combust . was there an outbreak here ? ma 'am ? I have something important to tell you . What is that ? I was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for . We did find what we came for . They were here . This is ... The most significant discovery in history of mankind . I know . it really is . But I wanted to talk to them . don 't you ... don 't you wanna know why they came ? Why they abandoned us ? baby . Charlie . I have proof . Look . Their genetic material predates ours . We come from them . - You 're kidding . - No . Okay . Okay . I guess you can take your father 's cross off now . Why would I wanna do that ? Because they made us . And who made them ? exactly . We 'll never know . But here 's what we do know . That there is nothing special about the creation of life . Right ? Anybody can do it . right ? I can 't . I can 't create life . What does that say about me ? that 's not ... I didn 't mean ... I wasn 't talking about ... Children ? Us . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! you are the most special person I have ever met in my life . And I love you . Oh . How much longer is this gonna take ? I 'm just the Captain . by the way . once belonged to Stephen Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scan . trying to get laid . I could ... I could say that . Right ? would it ? Vickers ! I was wondering ... Are you a robot ? ten minutes . if you can 't be with the one you love . Love the one you 're with " . " Love the one you 're with . what 's all this black stuff ? Gazpacho . Is that tobacco ? - Huh ? - Is that tobacco in your respirator ? Yeah . Sure . Tobacco . really . Millburn ? - Yeah ? You see this thing ? What do you think this thing was ? Some kind of a God ? what ? I don 't know . Kind of looks like ... What 's that ? my God ! Okay . - Okay . Just stay calm . Stay quiet . - Mill ! - What is it ? - It 's okay . I can handle this . baby . Hey . Prometheus . We have a elongated reptile type creature . forty inches with transparent skin . It 's beautiful . Okay ! we have two ! baby . Jesus ! Look at the size of that ! What is it ? - You need to stay calm ! - What 's there to be calm about ? because she is beautiful . She ? What in the hell makes you think that 's female ? Because she 's a lady . Look . Ah . Hey . Hey . She 's mesmerized . Come here . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . baby . Ohh ! You 're strong ! okay ? man ! Ahh ! - Cut it off ! - I ain 't touching that ! my God ! - It 's getting tighter . - I ain 't touching it ! I don 't want to touch it ! man ! For God 's sake ! Don 't be ... God ! You 're making it worse ! Aah ! It 's tightening ! Aah ! It 's breaking my arm ! Ahh ! Shit ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! my God ! my God ! ! íÇ Åáåí ! íÇ Åáåí my God ! you up ? Yeah . What 's up ? but I can 't reach Millburn and Fifield on the com . I 'm taking a few men down and see if I can rustle them up . Okay . Uh ... any idea where they are ? was just outside where you found your head . we 're coming . - Right . you 're coming with me . Come on . boss . did you fix that glitch ? Captain . It 's gotta be in the hard wire . Captain ? picked up a lifeform . and it was gone . I can find the probe and fix it for you if you like . Knock yourself out . doctors . Fifield ! Millburn ! come on down . are you alone ? Miss Vickers . - I 'd like your feed to my room . - Copy . You son of a bitch . You cut me off . What is this ? - Charlie ! - I just tripped . baby . Come on . Fifield ! Millburn ! Chance . I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . - Dr. Shaw ? - Yeah ? Do we have any idea what is oozing out of these vases ? they weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ! What ? Who is it ? Which one ? - Who is it ? - It 's Millburn . Eli . Don 't touch him ! Hold on ! Don 't touch him . what 's wrong ? okay ? what do you see ? baby . I want you to look at me and tell me what you see . get over here . It 's Okay . - Janek ? - What ?

What 's happening over there ? - I 'm okay ! - Let 's go ! Help me out ! It 'll be okay ! I got you ! We 're gonna get you out of here ! come in ! - Watch your head . - I 'm okay . Get him up ! come in ! Is anyone there ? This is Vickers . I need a medical team standing by the airlock . Holloway 's sick . - Sick with what ? - Just do it . Let 's get him back to the ship . We 're not safe down here . Charlie ? I 'm suiting up . - Charlie ! What 's going on ? Talk to me ! - Let 's move ! What was that thing back there ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Quickly ! We gotta move ! We gotta move ! He don 't look too good . Did he catch something down there ? - We had our helmets on . - I don 't know . this is Janek . Captain . God ! I 'm so sorry ! Come on ! Please ! Prometheus ! why is that door not open ? that is an order ! Get the goddamn door open ! okay ! It 's too late . I 'm sick ! it 's not ! Come on ! help me ! - Alright . this is Janek . Open that back door right now ! Hold that door ! do you copy ? open this door ! That is an order ! Open it ! What the hell is this ? He 's not coming on board . this is a sick man ! I can see that ! That 's why he 's not coming on my ship ! get over here ! Please ! We can still help him ! now ! I won 't leave him ! Then stay ! - Wait a minute ! - Please ! We can contain him and put him on the medpod ! Please ! Don 't do this ! Eli . - Vickers ! What are you doing ? baby . I love you . - No ! stay back ! - Don 't do this ! - No ! Don 't do this ! - Do it . Charlie ! - Do it . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Charlie ! My deepest condolences . it may be contaminated . we were all exposed . You need to ... we need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . of course . - Yes . given the circumstances . have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? I just want to be as thorough as possible . my . You 're pregnant . What ? three months so . that 's impossible . I can 't get pregnant . Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? but ten hours ago . There 's no bloody way I 'm three months pregnant . it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . - I want to see it . - I don 't think that 's a good idea . I want to see it . doctor . I want to see it . I want it out of me . to perform a procedure like that . - Our best option ... - I want it out . Put you back into cryostasis . get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please ! It must be very painful . let me give you something . there . to bring you back to cryotech . Must feel like your God abandoned you . What ? after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do you ... how do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Dr. Shaw ? go to beddy byes . Dr. Shaw ? She 's totally doped . Prepare her . Emergency procedure 's initiated . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . I need cesarean ! this medpod is calibrated for male patients only . It does not offer the procedure you have requested . Please seek medical assistance elsewhere ... initiate . Surgical procedure to begin . Running diagnostics . come on ! Get it out ! Come on ! Please ! God ! - Oh ! Come on ! - Initiating anesthetics . Please ! Commence surgical procedure . God ! God ! my God ! Come on ! Bridge - uh - to hanger . This is the captain . captain . - Can you see what I 'm seeing ? Fifeild 's monitors have popped up . What ? Where ? according to what I 'm looking at it 's right outside the goddamn ship . Open the door ! Fifield ! Do you copy me ? Come on in ! Fifield ? Wait a second . Wallace . Take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? I 'm coming down . Chance . Suiting up . Come on . Don 't let him get on the ship ! Take him out ! You got it ! Do it ! my God ! Help me out here ! Chance ? - Yes . Let 's go ! Clear the way ! We gotta get out of here ! Let 's go ! You 've been asleep . You 're on this ship all this time . Why ? I have a few days of life left in me here . until I was sure that you could deliver what you promised . Meet my maker . sir . Nice and clean . they 're all gone ? Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? Turn me around . You convinced me that ... then surely they can save us . please . anyway . Save you ? From what ? of course . Stand me up . I 'm alright . I 'm alright . sir . You don 't understand . You don 't know . This place isn 't what we thought it was . They aren 't what we thought they were . I was wrong . We were so wrong ! Charlie ... Dr. Holloway is dead . We must leave ! And what would Charlie do now ? If we 're so close ... ever asked by mankind ? How can you leave without knowing what they are ? Shaw ? Okay . Come in . doc ? You know what this place is ? Those uh ... Engineers ? This ain 't their home . maybe even military . because they 're not stupid enough ... to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit ass in those vases . They made it here . They got out . They turned on them . The end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you wanna know what they have to say ? I don 't care . Right . All you do is fly the ship . That 's right . captain . why are you here ? How about this ... I can 't bring none of that shit back home with us . Can 't let it happen . And I will do whatever I have to see that it doesn 't . captain . You came after all . I thought you wanted me to . I 'm just surprise to see you . David . Leave us now . sir . you 're going to die . You have a negative way at looking at things . Exactly why you should have stayed at home . arguing over who was in charge while you go look ... for some miracle in some ... godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That is the natural order of things . Anything else ? No ... Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . Sorry . Poor choice of words . Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland is not around to program you anymore ? I supposed I 'd be free . - You want that ? - " Want " ? Not a concept I 'm familiar with . doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . Dr. Shaw . So pleased you can join us . sir . What ? The air is perfectly breathable . - You sure ? - Positive . Wait . We still don 't know how Holloway got infected . If it 's in the air ... It 's not . How do you know that ? Smells fine to me . - Shall we ? - Please . The bridge is just up ahead . What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . Janek . Are you seeing this ? Shaw ? - Thousands . What the hell ? Ravel . Give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . Strip away the dome . Isolate that area . Bring it up . captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . no doubt . They are hyper sleep chambers . I trust . So they were traveling somewhere ? I 've managed to work out the broad strips . before things went odd . Leaving to go where ? Earth . Why ? one must first destroy . sir . Sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . - And you can speak to him ? - I believe I can . I 'm alright ! I 'm alright ! David . like he asked . - Ask him where they are from . - What are you doing ? Ask him what 's in this cargo . It killed his people . Shaw ! Enough ! David . You made it here and it was meant for us . Why ? Shaw ! Enough ! For God 's sake shut her up ! Was it ... I need to know why ? What did we do wrong ? Why do you hate us ? shoot her ! continue . Tell him why I came . No ! Ford ! Now ! There 's ... nothing . I know . Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . Mr. Chance . Take us home . captain . What the hell was that ? Prometheus ! Come in ! Shaw ? Is that you ? Copy ! Janek . Listen to me . - This ship is taking off ! - What ? What the hell is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! Shaw ! We 're going home ! there won 't be any home to go back to ! It 's carrying death ! And it 's headed for Earth ! this is not a warship . - I know . - Let 's go . I know that . But you must do it . let 's go ! please believe me ! Please ! I told you to get this ship going . Mr. Ravel . Warm up the ion propulsion . What the hell are you talking about ? burning the ion in the inner atmosphere ... Turns into a bullet . That is exactly the point . What the hell are you doing ? this is my ship ! I 'm telling you to take us home ! I 'm going to eject your life support module into that surface . That 's two years of life . You want it or you want to stay with me ? You got 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . You 're crazy . I can handle this myself . Feel free to join Ms. Vickers . and you 're going to need all the help you can get . If you can 't be with the one you love . you 're wrong . Why don 't you pay me on the other side ? Alirght . Get us as close as we can . Only got one shot at this . Lifeboats away ! Twenty seconds to evacuate . - Countdown initiated . - Ion propulsion is online . 8 ... - Come on ! gentlemen . Let 's do it ! Impact immanent Hands up ! God ! no ! No ! No ! No ! ... God ! Warning ! You have two minutes of oxygen remaining . Warning ! You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining . Airlock sealed . Oxygen levels now stabilizing . are you there ? This is David . I 'm here . You need to get out . Immediately . He 's coming for you . - Whose coming ? - Airlock breached . Ah ! Die ! I 'm so sorry . God ! I 'm sorry . Charlie . I can 't do it . I just can 't do it anymore . Elizabeth . Are you there ? Dr. Shaw ? Can you hear me ? Yes . I can hear you . I was afraid you were dead . You have no idea what afraid is . but please ... I need to ask you for your help . Why in hell would I help you ? you 'll never leave this place . Neither one of us is leaving this place . It 's not the only ship . There are many others . I can operate them . Dr. Shaw ? Dr. Shaw ! Over here ! Where 's my cross ? The pouch in my utility belt . you still believe ? Don 't you ? You said you can understand their navigation ? Use their maps ? of course . finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward . I don 't want to go back to where we came from . I want to go where they came from . David . Yes . I believe I can . But may I ask what you hope to achieve by going there ? They created us . Then they tried to kill us . They changed their minds . I deserve to know why . The answer is irrelevant . Does it matter why they changed their minds ? Yes . Yes it does . I don 't understand . Well ... and you 're a robot . - I 'm sorry . - That 's quiet alright . Final report of the vessel Prometheus . This ship and her entire crew are gone . make no attempt to come to its point of origin . and I 'm leaving it behind . It is New Year 's Day . The year of Our Lord 2094 . My name is Elizabeth Shaw . and I 'm still searching .

 Okay , okay . Here you go . And let 's go again . Which one is this ? Number nine ? Yeah , this is number nine . Bright Eyes , we call hen Are you watching this ? This is unbelievable . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - How many moves was that ? - 20 . Yeah , a perfect score is 15 . Doc , what are you giving her ? Hey , give me that video ! Chimp number nine , just one dose . Aren 't I seeing you later ? We are good to go . I 'm going to call you back . Yeah , all right . Thanks . Bye . The 112 . It works . On just the one primate . One is all we need . Full cognitive recovery . We 're ready . Look , are you sure you 're not rushing this ? I 've been working on this for five and a half years . The data is clear . We 're ready , Steven . All I need is your approval for human trials . For this , you 're going to need the board 's approval . There 's a lot of money riding on this , Will . You only get one shot . One shot is all I need . All right . But I 'll need to see - all the research . - You got it . - And , Will ... - Yeah ? Keep your personal emotions out of it . These people invest in results , not dreams . Okay . Meet chimp nine . Here she is tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower , the object of which is to move the tower from peg to peg , without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block . As expected , she was unable to complete the puzzle at all . Then , we gave her what we call ALZ-112 , a gene therapy that allows the brain to create its own cells in order to repair itself . In biology , this is called neurogenesis . Here at Gen-Sys , we call it the cure to Alzheimer 's . Donnie , you get her ready ? She 's got stage fright . Is that what it is ? Hey ! Hey ! She is going to break my hand ! Let go . Bright Eyes , let go ! Are you all right ? We 're ready to move on to the next phase . Human trials . - Here you go , Bright Eyes . - It 's your favorite fizzy soda , come on . Let 's go , Donnie . We should have her downstairs already . Okay ? Good girl . Come on out , girl . That 's right . That 's for you . Around the neck , Donnie ! Around the neck . Around the neck ! Jesus ! Donnie , do it now ! Open up ! Donnie ! I 'm going to sedate her . - No , no , no , no ! - Door ! Get the door ! Bright Eyes ! No , no , no , no Close it down . Close it down now ! Go get help . Donnie ! Donnie ! Come on . There have been absolutely no side effects associated with 112 . With one exception . For some reason , the chimps ' irises exhibit flecks of green . Actually , we first noticed it in chimp nine . Hence her nickname , Bright Eyes . You will see when we bring her in . Watch out ! In theory , this therapy can be used to treat a wide range of brain disorders . It is Virtually limitless . As are the potential profits , which is why we are confident that you will vote to approve human trials . No ! No ! Mr. Jacobs ? Mr. Jacobs , I am begging you . I am begging you not to do this . Look , it would costa small fortune to run lab work-ups on all of those chimps only to tell me what I already know . That they are contaminated . There are lives at stake here . These are animals with personalities , with attachments . - Attachments ? - Yeah . I run a business , not a petting zoo . Find the most cost-effective way to put those apes down . - I can 't do that . - You 're the chimp handler . Handle it . Steven ? - Well , that was fun . - They 've taken the 112 . The board have rejected your proposal . They 've chosen to advance other programs . Well , there must be something that you can do . Yes , there is . I could fire you . Believe me , we talked about it . We have five years of conclusive data . Parade all the data you want , you will never convince anyone to invest another dime . This drug has the potential to save lives . To bankrupt this company , more like . I swear , you know everything about the human brain except the way it works . Go back to the drawing board on the 112 . Start again in molecular development . Find a way to get there before someone else does . And clean up this mess . Franklin ? They carry small . She must have been pregnant when they brought her in . So that 's why ... She wasn 't being aggressive , she was just being protective ? She thought we were going to hurt her baby . Come here . I 'd take him myself , but my brother-in-law works for security . He 'd rat me out in a second . What , you want me to take it home ? I can 't take care of a monkey . - He 's not a monkey , he 's an ape . - Franklin , I ... It 's just for a couple days , until I find a sanctuary . That 's all I need . Franklin , no . Look , this isn 't my responsibility . This is company property . Okay . I 'm going to tell you what , Doc . Jacobs made me put down the other 12 . I 'm done . Be my guest . - Hey . - Hi . - Oh , you look beat . - Yeah . How is he doing ? Well , he has good days and bad days . Today , not so good . Although , he has been quoting Shakespeare . Oh , you got a pet . Just a temporary house guest . Oh . Well , it might be good for him . - Yeah . - Good night . Hey , Dad . - Dad ? - Will ! Hi . I didn 't hear you come in . Today is the day , right ? You thought I 'd forget . You have a big test today , right ? Chemistry ? Hey , Dad , do you want to see something ? What ? What is that ? Is he injured ? No , I think that is a birthmark . " But as for Caesar , " kneel down , kneel down , and wonder . " Yeah , don 't get too attached . He is a cute little guy , isn 't he ? Where are my car keys ? - My car keys ! Where did you put them ? - Dad . You don 't drive any more . I know that . Here , why don 't you feed him ? - Can you do that ? - Of course I can . Will , look at this . How old is he ? A day old ? Two days old ? Yeah . Well , he is a smart one , isn 't he ? What are you going to name him ? I don 't know . Right away Caesar displayed signs of heightened intelligence . So I kept him and brought my work home . By 18 months , Caesar was signing up to 24 words . By age two , Caesar was completing puzzles and models designed for children eight years and up . At age three , Caesar continues to show cognitive skills that far exceed that of a human counterpart . Home . Home . He completed the Lucas Tower in fifteen moves , a perfect score . I maintain my hypothesis that , A , the green in his eyes indicates that the ALZ-112 was passed genetically from mother to son and , B , that in the absence of damaged cells that need replacing , the drug in his system has radically boosted healthy brain functioning . And , he plays chess pretty well . - it 's my lamp ! And my room ! Dad ? - I don 't need you here . - Irena , I 'm sorry . I can 't do this any more . He belongs in a home . This is no way for him to live . Yeah , and no way to live . No way to live . Now , it 's my lamp . I 'm always ... it 'll make you better , Dad . Shh ! Dad ? Dad ? - Todd ! - Come inside for breakfast ! I 'll need to keep track of what I take from the lab . Although , I don 't foresee you needing more than one treatment a month . - Something amazing has happened . - Yeah . I 'll need a blood test , and a scan and the dosage . - You 'll have to be carefully monitored . - Will ... Now if I can sneak some ... - Will ! - Yeah ? I 'm not sick any more . It was nothing , Dad . Caesar . Where 's Caesar ? I want to see him . Caesar ? Caesar ! All right , he can 't have gone far . Caesar ! Daddy ? Daddy ! Caesar ! - Get out of here ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out of here ! Hey , hey , hey ! Enough ! Enough ! The hell is the matter with you ? If I see that animal anywhere near my house or my kids again ... He 's not dangerous . - It won 't happen again . - Damn right , it won 't . Come on , Dad . He just wanted to play . - Stay in the house . - Daddy 's got it . I told you not to go out without us . Oh , God . It 's okay . How bad is it ? I don 't know . He likes you . Mmm-hmm . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon and we can go get a treat . I 'm thinking ice cream . Good idea . You taught him to sign ? Just a handful of things . Basic stuff . What 's he saying ? Nothing . So , when do you think we should come back ? Well , you won 't need to come back because the stitches are dissolvable . I would just say watch out for signs of infection . Fever , redness . Okay . What 's he saying now ? Well , he thinks that you and I should have dinner together . I know . Hey , Caesar . Come on . Good to see you again , Caroline . You coming , Caesar ? So , what 's your secret ? I can 't take any credit. it 's in his genes . I think you 're being very modest . He 's pretty amazing . I think you 've built a pretty good home for Caesar here . - But ? He won 't stay this way for long . He 's gonna soon grow into a large , powerful animal . Come here . How has he been doing ? Okay . I think . I love chimpanzees . I 'm also afraid of them . And it 's appropriate to be afraid of them . Caesar would never hurt anyone . Hey ! Hey ! He 's happy here . Come on . Yeah , I can see that . Can we at least give him some open space ? Yeah . That probably would be a good idea . I know a place right across the bridge . The redwoods . It 's paradise . Come on . Come on . Come here . He doesn 't need a leash . He 'll be fine . Come on . Just to be safe . Come on . Come on , Caesar . This is the redwoods . Caesar ? All right . If I take this off , you cannot leave my sight . I would never find you again . Okay . - What is this ? - What 's he doing ? I dOn 't believe that . - What ? - He 's asking your permission . It 's a supplicating gesture . It 's okay . Come on , Caesar . Off you go ! Look at him go . - Caesar ! - Caesar ! - Caesar ! - Caesar ! Caesar ! There you are . Caesar ? Go on , Caesar . Climb ! Go higher . Climb ! Just be careful . Caesar , be careful ! Hi . What 's going on , buddy ? You get some love , too . Come on , honey . Is that a chimpanzee ? Hi . Come on ! Come on . Caesar ? Caesar . Come on . It 's all right . Come on . All right , come on . Let 's go . You getting in ? Caesar ? You okay , pal ? Are you a pet ? No . You 're not a pet . I 'm your father . What is Caesar ? Okay . Caesar , this is where I work . This is where you were born . Your mother was here with other chimpanzees . But she 's not here any more . So , that 's why I took you home to live with me . Yeah . Your mother is dead . The thing is , she was given medicine . Like the medicine I give to Charles . She passed it on to you . That 's why you 're so smart . Let 's take him home . Okay . Come on , explain it to me . Au right . I snuck him out of the lab to save his life . I had no idea that the effects had been transferred vertically from his mother . But since then , he 's been displaying incredible signs of intelligence . I designed the 112 for repair , but Caesar has gone way beyond that . Here is his IQ from last year . Since then , it 's doubled . This is wrong , Will . My father was gone . This drug brought him back . You never saw how bad he was . - He has his life again . - And what about Caesar ? - What about him ? - Where does he fit in ? With me . With US . Listen , I know it 's been hard for you , but you 're trying to control things that are not meant to be controlled . The 112 works . Do you realize how you sound ? All I 'm saying is , this is a good thing . Caesar is proof of that . So is my father . Caesar , eat your food . Dad , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Antibodies . His system has found a way to fight the 112 virus so that it can 't deliver its therapy . My father 's disease is going to return with a vengeance . Honey , have you seen the car wax ? It 's a Mustang . it 's looking great . What did I do ... Stop ! You stop right now ! Hey ! Hey ! Get out of there ! Get out of that car ! What the hell are you doing ? Get out of my car ! I said get out of my car ! I 'm a pilot ! I got to get to the airport ! How am I going to get there now , huh ? Answer the goddamned question ! What were you doing ? I have a car just ... Well , it 's not obviously ... That 's it , I 'm done . The police can handle this . You stay right there ! You are going nowhere , mister ! You or your son are going to pay for this ! But I sure as hell am not going to ! This is your problem ! You made the mess ! - I 'm sick of the two of you ! - I 'm not going ... You stay right there ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Caesar ! Stop ! Daddy ! No , no . Caesar ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You didn 't mean it . It 's okay . Hey . Take that thing off of him . Will you take that thing off of him ? Come on . Look . I 'll take him in . Okay ? No , he 's under court orders . You can 't do that . It 's fine , let him . Bring him in when you 're ready . - Take it off . - Thank you . Caesar , Caesar , Caesar , Caesar ? Caesar . Not right now . It 's gonna be okay . Let 's just see what it 's like inside . Okay ? Come on , Caesar . Let 's go . Come on . Trust me . It 's okay . Go on . He hasn 't spent any time with other chimps . We 're used to that . He 'll be a little skittish at first , but we 'll integrate him . You 'd be surprised how quick they adapt . We provide a stimulating environment . He 's going to thrive here . Come on , let 's do some paperwork . Oh , and make sure you lock that door when you come in . Caesar . It 's gonna be okay . Everything is gonna be okay . Don 't be scared . You 're gonna stay here now . No . We 're not going home right now . It 's okay . In our experience , the longer you drag out the goodbyes , the harder it is . Can I just sign that later ? You 'll probably miss him more than he 'll miss you . Best give him a couple of weeks to get used to the place . Will , We have to go . We have to go home . I 'm coming back soon . Okay ? Just call ahead before you do . Hey , over here ! Hey , I can get you out ! Come on . Over here . Come on . Hey . Down here . Stupid monkey . Is that all you got ? Come on ! It 's a madhouse ! It 's a madhouse ! Court order hasn 't been filed , so it 's not in the system . Once it comes through , it 'll take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date . - 90 days ? - Yes , sir , 90 days . - You 'll be notified by mail . - Hang on . Right . Here 's what 's gonna happen . You 're going to go back on your computer , you 're gonna shift things around , and you 're going to get me a date for my appeal this week . You got it ? I can 't help you . All right , then we have a problem . Because I 'm not moving until you do . 90 days , sir . Be thankful you 're talking about court dates . You 're lucky they didn 't put that animal down . I promise to get him back soon , Dad . Dad ? My father 's immune system continues to reject the 112 virus , rendering the gene therapy obsolete . His health is deteriorating , and the disease is progressing rapidly . I need a more aggressive virus strain . A faster delivery method . Because at this rate ... I can 't lose them both . I won 't lose them both . Hi . Can we talk ? Make it fast . I 've got a meeting . In the 10 years you 've been running Gen-Sys , how many drugs have come down the pipeline that could save millions of lives , that could change everything ? What are you talking about ? The ALZ-112 . What happened to you , Will ? You used to be the star of this lab . Now you hardly ever show , and when you do , you waste your time and that of your team 's fixating on a drug that , after what happened , is never , ever going to get approved . The 112 is dangerous , Will , and it doesn 't work . I treated my father with it . It does work . You did what ? You did what ? - He beat the disease . - Like we predicted . - Bring him in . - There 's been a complication . Well , does it work , or doesn 't it ? My father 's disease eventually outran the cure . For goodness sake . His immune system produced antibodies that beat the viral component , but it will work . I 've already developed a virus strain that I think will be more aggressive . You think ? Just let me test it . You 're wasting my time . There 's more . The applications go beyond the disease . There are indications that show that therapy can improve cognitive functioning , memory quality ... What are you saying ? My father didn 'tjust recover . He improved . You mean increased intelligence ? It 's not conclusive , but yes . I want you to start testing the revised 112 on chimps ASAP . - Okay . - I 'll give you whatever you need . Absolutely . Dinner time ! Mmm . Grade A primate chow . Go on . Don 't you know food when you see it ? You think that 's funny , huh ? I 'll show you something funny . He 'll learn wno 's boss soon enough . - What about his clothes ? - What about them ? I don 't know . It might cause problems with the other apes . Good . I 've counted 10 apes . Correct ? Yep . Good . All the way to the back . Okay . You guys are moving really quick on this . What 's the big rush ? First day back , and you 're still complaining . Koba . Hi , I 'm Will . Okay . This one . He 's very calm . Yeah , this guy has seen the inside of a whole lot of labs . He knows the drill . Thought I 'd join you . Watch our progress . Get him prepped . Tighten your masks . Pass me the 113 . Pulse-ox is good , blood pressure steady . Aerosol delivery in place . Releasing the 113 . Franklin , get your mask on ! - Got it ? - Yeah . Tighten the straps . You okay ? Yeah , okay . Move it ! Let 's go ! Get up and exercise , you lazy baboons ! - Intelligence results are remarkable . - No adverse effects . Apes have amazingly strong immune systems . Yeah . All right , keep an eye on it . Okay . Sorry about that . These guys are more resilient than I am . Excuse me a sec . Hurt bad ? You know sign ? Circus Orangutan . He 's good . Careful . Human no like smart Ape . I want you working late tonight . Gen-Sys needs three more of them . Hey . Hey . Hey ! - Hey . - Hey , Caesar . Hi . Are you hurt ? Are you hurt ? Show me . Caesar . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . It 's okay . Sometimes the new kid on the block gets picked on . - Don 't worry . - God , what have they done to you ? That 's bullshit . What the hell did you do ? - Let go , man . - Hey ! What 's the problem here ? I 'm taking him out of here . Right now . Not without a court order , you 're not . He 's not yours any more . I promise , if I find out he 's been mistreated in any way , I 'll have this place shut down . Go on . Hey . Hi . Hey . No . No , we 're not going home right now . But I 'm going to get you out of here . I promise . You have to trust me . Caesar , you have to trust me . Okay ? I think this visit is over . Trust me . It 'll be okay . Come on ! Move it ! Let 's go ! Wow ! There 's hundreds of them . This is like your own private zoo . More like a prison for hairy dudes . They watch TV ? We call it enrichment . This one 's so cute ! What 's his name ? The name is Cornelia . It 's a she . - Oh , my God ! - Don 't get too close . This one scared me half to death . Yeah . That big guy 's called Maurice . No fun . Here , I 'll show you something fun . Check this out . Are you insane ? You shouldn 't be in here . Hey , you 're next ! Come on , let 's go . I spend too much time in here as it is . Come on . Check out this guy . Hey , that one is a pain in the ass . Thinks he 's special or something . Freaky . Hey , come here . It 's like he 's thinking or something ... Oh , my God ! He 's got his throat ! - Let him go ! - Let go ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . I told you not to get too close , man . Come on , guys . Let 's get out of here . Hey . Some things aren 't meant to be changed . You need to accept that . Hey ! Hey ! What 's going on here ? More 113 trials . We 're just preppingm No , we have to analyze Koba 's blood work first . Franklin knows this . Where is he ? He 's been out sick for two days . Well , I didn 't authorize this . No . I did . We agreed to test sparingly on one subject . And that one subject is stunning . It 's a virus , we don 't know the human-related effects . The drug works , Will . Tell him , Linda . For starters , Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower . Every test result verifies its effectiveness . - No more tests . - What are you ... Not until we have a better understanding of what we 're dealing with . Look , I 'll tell you exactly what we 're ... Look . Just give us a minute . Excuse me , put the ape back in the cage , and be gentle . Will , I 'll tell you exactly what we 're dealing with here . We 're dealing with a drug that is worth more than everything else we are developing combined . You make history , I make money . Wasn 't that our arrangement ? No , there are risks . Don 't talk to me about risks . You gave your own father an experimental drug . I could finish your career with one phone call . I 'll save you the trouble . I quit . We will proceed without you . Look , you don 't know what you 're doing . These tests need to be contained . You have no idea if the 113 is stable , what kind of damage it can do to people . Yes . Well , that is why we test it on chimps . lsn 't it ? Dr. Rodman , it 's me , Franklin ! I need to talk to you ! Can you come to the door ? Doc ? - Who the hell are you ? Get out of here ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You wouldn 't be trying to entrap me , would you ? Well , I can 't say I approve . They 're not people , you know . You gonna let him go or not ? Caesar ? Hey , come on . Come on , we 're going home . Home . Come on , we 're really going . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Yeah . Come on . Caesar ? I guess he likes it better here with his own kind . Why cookie Rocket ? Apes alone ... weak . Apes together strong . Apes stupid . - Damn it , Rodney ! - You leave the hose out in the atrium again ? What ? No ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , get up ! Eight months after its launch , Earth 's first manned space flight to Mars ... I swear , Dodge , I 'm telling the truth . Yeah , well , if you didn 't take my cookies then who the hell did ? - I don 't know . - Hey ! Will you two morons knock it off ? I 'm going home . I get more peace in the goddamn ape house . Dad , I 'm sorry . - Well done , Rodney . - I swear ... Mr. Franklin ? it 's Dottie . Mr. Franklin ? Hello ? What the hell ? God said , " Let the waters bring forth moving creatures ... " Rodney get to the platform now . Rodney ! What the hell do you think you 're doing , huh ? Get ! Go on . Get back in your cage . I 'm warning you . Go on , get ! That 's it . See ? Thats what you get ! Now get back ! What 's wrong with you ? Dumb monkey ! Take your stinking paw off me , you damn dirty ape ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! I swear I 'm gonna skin each and every one of you ! Caroline , have you been up to Caesar 's room ? No one is answering . Landon ? Will ? Will ! What happened ? He spoke . What do you ... What ? Your ape . He spoke . What in the hell ? I don 't believe this . I 'm gonna skin each and every one of you ! I need someone to coordinate with the SFPD . Tell them we got a fatality . - What is it ? - I know where he 's headed . Len ? Let 's go . - Jacobs . - Mn Jacobs , it 's Linda from Will 's team . Something horrible has happened . Franklin is dead , from a viral infection . The hell are you talking about ? He was exposed to the 113 . It does something to people that it doesn 't do to apes . He 'll have to go through the city and across the bridge . Mr. Jacobs ? Mr. Jacobs , are you ... What the hell ? Steven Jacobs ! This is my facility . We 've had a breach . We need to get up in the air and track them down and destroy them ! Okay ? Wait a sec ! Wait a second . Look . You 've got to trust me on this ! Okay ? You guys might want to get your cameras ready . Normally these guys are quite shy . They just tore through a park on the north side . - They 're being led ! - Got to hold the button ! - What ? - The button ! They 're being led ! These apes are smarter than you think ! We 've got to kill the leaden / No , you do not tell them I am stuck in traffic . You make up something smarter ! Hold on . What the ... They 're on the bridge . They 're trying to get to the redwoods . SFPD Police One , this is Air Ops . Seal off the south end . What 's the status of the mounted units ? Good to go , sir . All right . As soon as they reach you , push north ! North side , we ' re going to push them right to you . No problem , we ' re ready for them . North side is locked . They 'll never get through here . As soon as they hit the gap , we 'll take them out ! - You 're going to shoot them ? - Like shooting fish in a barrel . Good . Turn that thing around . Keep moving . Get off this bridge , sir . - No , you don 't understand . - You don 't understand ! Get off this bridge now ! This is an evacuation . Get out ! - All civilians clear . - Please comirm . Get these people off the bridge ! Wait ! Go up . Get under . Stand by to send in mounted units . They 're gonna slaughter them . - I 'm going to get Caesar . - Hey . Hey , hey . Listen . You be careful . Hey ! Get down from there . You 're not allowed up there . But I have to get to my car ! Let go of me ! I 've got to get to my car . It 's important ! Hey ! Push them north ! Get out of the way ! No ! Quick or you 'll lose them in the fog ! DO it ! Where are they ? I can 't see them . CHP North , do you have a visual ? No , sir . Negative . Safeties off ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! - Get back ! Get back ! - Everybody , pull back ! Caesar ! That 's him . That 's the leader . 255 , come in ! Are you there ? Help me . Help me . Take my hand . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . No . Come on . Not you . No ! No ! Stupid monkey ! No ! No ! Caesar ! Caesar ? Caesar . I 'm sorry . This is my fault . This has to stop . This isn 't the way . You know what they 're capable of . Please come home . If you come home , I 'll protect you . Caesar is home . Okay . Caesar is home . Go . An unknown group have caused a major disturbance here in the Bay Area , including the City Zoo and the Golden Gate Bridge , causing widespread damage and some reported injuries . Eyewitnesses have also reported seeing apes running through the city .

 - Alan ? - Shh . Alan ? Hey . It 's all right , Sarah . What happened ? Just try to relax . Where am I ? In Isolation . We 're preparing to do a scan of your tumor . My tumor ? How did you find out ? Hatake found the soar from your surgery . Let 's just get these scans done , okay ? Give me a minute to get to the imaging room and I 'll monitor the scans as they come out . Okay . Alan . This will be quick , I promise . All right ? Hey , look behind you ! Alan , help ! What 's wrong ? You were screaming . I loved your mother very much . She felt the same . But when she found out about the Inuit children she took you away , forbid me to see you . But I have looked after you in my own way . Inuit children ? You stole them . Most were placed in homes , given to those unable to have children of their own . Most ? None of those lives were yours to give . I deeply regret what I 've done . Seems like you really believe that . This is the night I received the National Science Fellowship . I was very proud of you . You were there ? I am an honorary member of the board . I voted for you , but nothing more . You won that on your own . Of course I did , because despite what you might think this stalker book proves , you have nothing to do with me or anything I 've ever done . Julia , please . Our eyes , why are they silver ? A rare genetic anomaly . You 're lying . Tell me the truth . I deserve that . I 'm trying to protect you . It 's not your job to protect me . The tumor has extended into your spinal fluid and there 's a real chance that ifs spreading to your brain . I just wanted to go out into the field . Just once . This was my last chance to really do something that mattered . I 'm sorry I lied to you . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm really glad you 're here . Okay , stop moving . Stop hurting me . Tulok is throwing the ilaria bodies out on the ice . I 'm fine , thanks for asking . Wouldn 't know it by listening to you moan like a baby . We checked everyone else , no serious injuries . Right , nothing at all serious about this . It 's a miracle nobody else got hurt . Thanks to you . But this isn 't over , is it ? Ilaria won 't stop . Ever . They 'll hunt down every single person in this village just to keep their secrets . Well , what are we gonna do about it ? We 're not gonna do anything . You 're gonna take your people ... Our people , Miksa . Whatever . You need to leave here as soon as possible . This is our home . We 're not gonna run . Anana , he 's right . Our blood is in this ice . Your blood on the ice is all that 's gonna be left if you stay here . If you scatter to the wind , you still have a fighting chance . He 's been watching me my whole life . Album was filled with photos of me from Atlanta , medical school , even my overseas postings . He told me his daughter died in a fire . A complete lie . He 's done nothing but lie to us from the day we got here . There was this picture of all of us together like a family . Me , Hatake and my mother in that cabin downstairs . I grew up here . So did a lot of other kids who he experimented on . He might have done something to you while you were sick down on Level R. Code 725 . To his own daughter ? Attention , Code 725 ... I 'm gonna find Hatake . Level G , Bacteriology . Attention , Code 725 , Level G ... I found something you may want to see . Where is it ? Where is this scrapbook ? How long have you been stalking her ? If you are here to accuse me of watching over Julia , I openly admit to doing so . What you 've been doing is sick . I am her father . She might not accept that but a simple DNA test can prove it . You lost your rights to be her father years ago . A topic I would enjoy debating with you were there not something more pressing . Dr. Adrian is departing the base with the missing core samples of the Narvik . Where 's he going ? Nowhere . There is nothing out there but certain death . He doesn 't look like he 's going nowhere . The ice will take him . Trust me . Ironic words coming from you . The important thing is that the virus is gone . And like Dr. Adrian , it will never be found . If Narvik makes it out of the Arctic Circle , there 's no turning back , millions will die . And those who don 't die , they 'll be vectors , spreading the disease until ... So why did Adrian take all the Narvik ? Either he works for ilaria , or he 's about to . Juneau 's eight days out . No , he 'd never make it that far on a snowmobile . Echelon deep-space listening station , abandoned in ' 85 . It 's only 50 miles out . What are the chances the radio is still working 29 years later ? I think we 're about to find out . Julia , don 't . It 's too dangerous . The virus is gone . Julia . Alan ? Don 't . We need to go . My National Science Award , what did you do with it when we moved out ? I , um ... I put it in storage with the rest of your stuff . What 's got you thinking about that ? We never really talked about that night . What 's there to talk about ? I always wondered why you gave Peter your ticket . Is this about me and Sarah ? No . You know what-f ? You said you didn 't wanna talk about it . And I don 't . I just ... I ... Ah . You know what ? Forget it . I don 't wanna become one of those things . You know what I 'm asking . I can 't do it myself . Please . Thank you . Scheduled maintenance , Bacteriology , Level G. Dr. Jordan , you should be resting . You mean dying ? No thanks . Whatever time I have left I wanna spend in the lab . Let me help you . You can just set it there . Thank you . Do you know where Dr. Farragut and Dr. Walker went ? They didn 't tell you ? They don 't trust me . Can you blame them ? I 've done things , terrible things , in the name of science . Edward Jenner infected an 8-year-old boy with smallpox to test an unproven theory . He could 've been charged with murder . But the child survived . And Jenner pioneered the use of modern vaccinations . He saved millions of lives . You may have done some terrible things , but I can 't help but think none of that will matter if we get this antiviral to work . - Can you hear me ? - Yes , I can . As long as your bosses at ilaria meet my price and get me out of here , you 'll get your stuff . Adrian . Stop ! Don 't make me use this . Take it easy with that . We 're not here to hurt you . Like you just happened to be in the neighborhood , decided to stop by ? Alan . The Narvik . Do you have the package ? I need confirmation . Shit . Just give me a second . You can 't make a deal with these people . They will take what they want and kill you . I 've worked too hard to leave with nothing . The virus could kill millions . This is a CDC problem . I just want you people to stay in business . Do you have confirmation ? Hello ? Damn it . Hey ! Unh . You okay ? It 's just a scratch . Can 't say the same for the radio . It 's pretty busted up , but I think I can fix it . Since when ? I 've had to learn to do a lot of things without you . It 's chilly in here , but it 's downright subzero between you two . Battery 's toast . We 're gonna need another power source . This place must have had a backup generator . I 'll see if I can find it . You 're not coming with us , are you ? I have no choice . You do , and you keep choosing him . Look , when ilaria 's finished with the base , they 'll be coming here . I can slow them down , give our people a fighting chance . Miksa . What 's wrong ? - A snowmobile 's missing . - Who 's gone ? No one from our village . How many homes did you pm m ? Four . No , no . Five passed me on the way to the village last night . The only advantage we had is ilaria didn 't know what happened here . They still won 't , not if I can stop him . I 'm going with you . Unh . You 'll just slow me down . - Get everyone out as fast as you can . - Let 's go . We checked Julia 's blood already . There 's no viral antibodies . Did you notice anything abnormal ? Not from the test , no . Then you need to change your perspective . Look at the form , the structure of the DNA . Why ? What am I going to find ? I don 't know . But there must be something . Some would call Dr. Walker 's recovery miraculous . I do not believe in miracles . My faith lies in science . I believe that is a quality we share . Julia 's the expert . If she were here , she could find what I 'm missing . When I saw you pressing forward in spite of everything , that is a mark of a true scientist . Do not give up now .

Let me guess . A rocky divorce ? I 'm not gonna tell you again to shut up . Well , it seems like you just did . Get down ! Get to the door . Throw out the virus and no one else has to die ! Follow me . All we want is the virus . Throw it outside and we 'll let you go ! I think there 's only one of them . How do you know ? Because if he had friends , they 'd have broken down the door by now . Either way , he won 't let us walk out of here . Can you reach it ? I don 't know . So much for the radio . What do you want , Peter ? Why are you here ? I want to help you . No . Please . This will all be over soon . Sooner than you think . I really thought I was close to a breakthrough . What ? Your awards presentation . The National Science thing . I was wrapped up in work . You wanna talk now ? In the snowcat , when you brought it up , I ... It all came back to me . The ceremony was half over , they were about to call me , you still hadn 't shown up . I was mad , but I know how you lose track of time . I realized when Peter showed up , you didn 't get lost in the work , you just chose not to come . I think about that night all the time . I mean , if I hadn 't given Peter my ticket , would you guys have ended up ... ? You asked about the last time I 'd seen Peter . I lied to you . I know . He told me . I should have told you the truth . I just didn 't know how . Come on . Your National Science Award is not in storage . I smashed it to pieces about a week after you left . Cut the hell out of my hand . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry too , Jules . He 's coming in . ♪ Noel , Noel ♪ ♪ Noel ♪ ♪ Jules . Please tell me there 's no cabin down there . I wanted to log this just in case . I re-sequenced Julia 's DNA and I found something incredible . We were so intent on finding antibodies to the virus , we missed this completely . This is a scan of Julia 's telomeres eight days ago when she was first infected with the virus . And this is her sample from two days ago . You can see her telomeres have lengthened , restored to the lengths you 'd see in a newborn all without requiring telomerase . Is this a side effect of the virus like the pigmentation in her eyes or is this why she recovered ? I 'm not sure , but I don 't have to tell you that the medical possibilities are endless . Theoretically , we could induce the absence of telomerase . That would remove the fuel necessary for cancer cells to grow and if we could remove the fuel , then my cancer cells would die . That 's why Dr. Hatake told me to look at Julia 's DNA . Somehow he knew . If we supplement my weakened immune system , target the tumor directly , inject Julia 's cerebral spinal fluid into my central nervous system ... I 'm gonna start trials on the computer and see if I can get a prep on a spinal tap . If I 'm gone by the time you get back , or if this is just me grasping at straws , I just want you to know I 'm not scared . I 'm ready . I guess that 's all . We 're just going further into the ice . What if there 's not another way out ? What was that ?

Sutton 's man will find this tunnel any moment . We need to move . Constance ? What ? I had to pick a side . Constance made me choose , so I did . That 's why Hiroshi locked me up down here . Tell them there are rules we must follow . - There can be no more than 500 . - Five hundred what ? Talk to me , damn it ! Tell me about your eyes ! You can survive four minutes without oxygen , four days without water , 40 days without food . There was so much pain . Rebirth feels like dying . We had no idea , the enormity of it at the time . We thought we had found the ultimate gift . Eternal life . But to live forever is to die 10,000 times . Your brother said we 're almost ready to move out . You 've been standing there for a while . I was wondering when you were gonna say something . Trying to give you some time . For what ? This is our home . We shouldn 't be running from it . I learned at a young age , you build a home out of people , not places . Yeah ? And where 's your home , Sergio ? I , uh ... I haven 't found it yet . You didn 't have to come back here . After what Miksa did to you , how I treated you , you could 've let them come . Everyone in this village owes you their life . Doesn 't excuse the things I 've done . You 're right . But it can be a start . You can be the man you want to be , not the man they made you . Do you believe him ? No , I don 't believe him . What he said is crazy , and if you 'd have asked me 10 days ago if I thought any of this was true ... We are talking about immortality . So much has happened that we can 't explain . We can explain it , scientifically , not with fairy tales . I survived the virus without antibodies in my blood and my eyes , they 're just like his . I just need to know what I am now . He 's found the hatch . Stay here . We have to hide the virus . An hour and 42 minutes in culture the cancer cells are showing ... How long have you been down here ? Two ... No , nine . Twenty-nine . Days ? Twenty-nine years , 10,500 days , give or take a week . Why did Hatake chain you down here ? Every night I have dreamed of my revenge . I have killed him thousands of times , a thousand different ways . You hate him also . Why is that ? We have to go . He 's in the tunnel . I hid the bag in case we 're caught . Free me . No . No . He 's out of his mind . We can 't trust him . If we don 't let him go , they 'll kill him , and I need answers . Get off me ! What are you doing ? The longer you live , the more you will lose . You will have to watch everyone you have ever loved die . There is nothing in this world to fill an eternity . Free me . Don 't move . Hands where I can see them . Where 's the virus ? I don 't know . Suit yourself . You have 10 seconds to tell me where it is before I pull this trigger . Or maybe I shoot her first . No . It 's done . No more Narvik . You Okay ? Yeah , I think . I 'm just ... You don 't really believe that . What should I believe , Alan ? Come on . - Engine 's not frozen up . It should start . - Oh , thank God . Don 't thank him yet . We still have to get home . What happened ? I found her in BSL-3 . She appears to have suffered multiple grand mal seizures . Sarah , I 'm here . Can you hear me ? It 's me , it 's Alan . What do you have her on ? Propofol . I had to induce coma to slop the seizures . Her vitals are too low . She doesn 't have long . Where were you ? Echelon Station . We met Gunnar Mikaelsson . This is not how I wanted you to find out . I don 't think you wanted anyone to find out , locking him up in a dungeon 50 miles away . He betrayed your mother to Sutton . It was a death sentence . I repaid him with a life sentence . I know you don 't trust me , but I was protecting you . They have gone to great lengths to keep their secrets . Who are they ? The 500 . Yes . Five hundred immortals . They run Ilaria Corporation . She 's crashing . Clear . If I 'm gone by the time you get back , I just wanted you to know I 'm not scared . And , Alan , I know that you don 't believe in life after this , and I don 't either , but I 'm ready . Dr. Hatake said something to me earlier . He said his faith lies in science . I guess mine does too . And science has proven that nothing disappears without a trace . Nature doesn 't know extinction , only transformation . We 're all made up of the same atoms that created the universe , right ? In essence , we all live forever . She doesn 't have much time . A few hours at the most . If we are going to act , we must do it quickly . How ? The cancer is in her brain . She 's ... She 's dying . Then she has nothing to lose . All my life , I 've adhered to science . You 're asking me to believe in miracles . Are they so different ? You believe you can save her ? No . But Julia can . Ripped By mstoll

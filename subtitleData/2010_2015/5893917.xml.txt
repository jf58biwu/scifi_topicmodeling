 Previously on " the 100 " ... [ all coughing ] Welcome to mount weather . [ people moaning ] Anya ? Ok , come on . [ water rushing ] There has to be another way . Anya : There isn 't ! Thank you . You killed 300 of my warriors . I can 't show my face without a prize . The grounders took them . The guy with the one eye . He 's got clarke 's watch . Where is the girl who was wearing this watch ? ! [ gunshot ] Let 's get moving . Are we really going to do this ? Bring the ark to the ground ? Jaha : Godspeed , my friends . There were multiple crash sites Over 100 square miles . We 're ready to go . It 's a missile . Our ancestors used them to destroy the world . We 're gonna use one to get back to it . [ wind blowing ] Clarke : Anya , we 've been walking for hours . Where are we going ? Quiet . Why not just kill me and get it over with ? You can tell the commander what the mountain men are doing to us in there . So let 's work together . We don 't have to be enemies . And unite with someone as weak as you ? I have what i need . Hey . We both want the same thing . Get down . They found us . [ distant shouting ] Run . Bellamy : Everyone , eyes peeled . We 're in grounder territory . Murphy : Everything is grounder territory , all right ? I can 't keep running , all right ? We don 't even know if the guy finn killed was telling the truth . Keep moving . We can give him a minute . No , we can 't . You heard what that grounder said . " they 'll outlive their usefulness . " I heard what he said when you had a gun to his head . Look , you think i wanted to do that ? He would have told his people we 're coming , And by the time we got there , our people would be dead . Maybe that 's something you can live with , but i can 't ! Hey , you did what you think you had to do , But you are not yourself right now , And i can 't be out here with another loose cannon . Guys . [ flies buzzing ] Fall in . Where the hell did they come from ? From the ark . [ buzzing continues ] It 's a rough landing . [ birds chirping ] There 's nothing we can do for these people . We got to go . [ distant woman whimpering ] Did you hear that ? Hey . Hey , someone 's down there . Hey ! Woman : Please ! Up here ! Please , help me ! Mel ? Help me ! You know her ? Shut up , murphy . She 's my friend . We have to do something . Help me ! Mel : Sterling , please ! We can 't stop . This isn 't a grounder , finn . We have a rope . You saw her . She 'd never be able to hold on to it . We 'd have to lower somebody down . It 'll take time that we don 't have . I hate this as much as you- - i know . I--i know . Ok , i know . Sterling : Just hold on ! Just hold on , mel . Mel : Sterling ! We 'll come back for her . Ok ? Mel : Please ! We 're movin ' out . Finn : Wait ! Sterling ! Hey ! Mel : I can 't hang on ! Murphy : Well , it looks like we 're taking that break after all , huh ? Man , on radio : Be advised , the fence is live . Copy that . Ladies and gentlemen , the fence is hot . [ people cheer ] trust me , You do not want to go near it . [ overlapping chatter ] Man : Careful . [ girl outside shrieks ] [ grunting ] Reyes , there you are . Yes , sir . Dr. Griffin cleared you for work . How 's your leg ? It 's not a factor . What 's the job ? Need you to build a radio beacon . If the other ark stations have survivors , we need to know it . I 'm on it . [ sighs ] I got it . Ok , report to engineering and we 'll get you started . Roger that . Thank you , sir . Drein daun . Drein daun . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Hey . Wait , just a se ... Ah . Mmm . Ah . [ coughs ] [ sighs ] Thank you . What 's your name ? Your name . You . Zoran . Zoran . Good name . I 'm thelonious . Thuh-lawn-us . Yeah . Thee-lo-noose . Jaha : Please , i mean you no harm . Strangers are not welcome here . Please ! I 'm injured ! Please ! [ groans ] [ twig snaps ] quiet . You can 't even walk in the woods . If i 'm such a burden , then cut me loose . Heavy footfalls , Broken branches . You even smell like them . [ distant men chattering ] Down . No . Not to drink . Then why stop ? We should be running . You reek . Cover yourself in it . [ panting ] I 'm almost there ! Once i have her , pull us up ! Well , i 'd say he 's heard one too many Of your motivational speeches . Shut up , murphy . Give me your hand . It 's ok , mel . Ok . I got you . All right . Ok . I got you- - [ screaming ] All righty . [ whimpers ] i got you , ok ? Give me your hand . [ crying ] You 'll be all right . I got you . [ screams ] Bellamy : Sterling ! Sterling ! Sterling : Aah ... Mel ! Mel , hold on . [ crying ] Focus on me . You can do this . Oh , no ! Yes , you can . You 're strong . I 'm not strong ! Stubborn , maybe . So be stubborn a little longer . I 'm not gonna let you die , you hear me ? [ crying ] ok . We 're out of rope . So we make a new one . If anything happens to our friends , when we could- - We don 't know if we could save our friends . For all we know , they may be dead already . We 've all thought it . But what we do know is we could save this one girl . Sterling was one of us . She was his friend . I 'm in . [ mel crying ] How do we do it ? Bellamy : We make new rope from the wreckage . Go find wires , seatbelts , anything . Come on . Come on . I hope you 're right about this . So do i . [ wind blowing ] You said i wasn 't welcome here . Zoran 's father thought i should let you stay . Then i should thank him . He is gathering supplies . [ groans ] You speak english . I was aiming for the eastern united states . Did i make it ? This is the dead zone , On the way to the city of light . I am sienna . You must eat , Then rest . [ sighs ] [ grunting ] Good . Mmm ! Thank you . Is the city of light your home ? It will be , If we can find it . Oh , god . Zoran ! I--i 'm sorry . He surprised me . We 're used to the hatred . I have no room for hate . What happened to him ? He was born that way . It happens sometimes . Radiation . Fate . When such a child is born , We leave it out , Let nature reclaim it , To erase the stain from the bloodline . How could you do that ? That is our way . I knew what was expected of me . I could not give up my child . We left our home so that he might live . You chose to leave your people ? He is my son . [ overlapping chatter ] [ music playing ] [ voice distorted by helium ] what the hell are you doing in here , wrench monkey ? Helium , wick ? Really ? Ark welders aren 't toys . [ normal voice ] come on , reyes . You got to enjoy life . You enjoy enough for everybody . So , still dreaming up designs the rest of us will have to fix ? Hey , my designs are elegant . If only they were realistic . [ scoffs ] Well , it 's been real , But i have a beacon to work on . In that case , welcome to my party . Schematics are over here on the bench . You already designed it ? Yep ... We 're using parts we salvaged From the station 's debris field . Obviously . Oh , also , I have a little something for you . What a piece of crap . You 're welcome ? I can get around just fine . What you need to worry about is countering the mountain effect . That 's your job . [ sighs ] damn engineers . Damn mechanics . [ both panting ] [ distant men chattering ] How are they still following us ? Because of you . Time to end this . Anya , i am stepping where you step . I 'm covered in mud . We 're not leaving a trail . Anya : They 're following something . They 're not following us . They 're tracking us . Search yourself . If i 'm right , it should feel like a- - A small bump just under your skin . Oh . It 's you . Ok , i could remove it , but you need to untie my hands . I just need something sharp and sterile . [ groans ] aah ! [ spits ] [ panting ] I will not go back there . All right . Ease it out slowly . [ bellamy grunting ] Just hang on . I 'm almost there . It 's ok . I got you . I got you . Just put your arms around me . I can 't . Yes , you can . It 's ok . This will hold . I 'll get you up . I promise . Ok . Ok . [ whimpering ] [ grunts ] I got her ! Pull us up ! Don 't you worry , bellamy . I won 't drop you . Just pull , murphy . Raven : Hey . I 'm changing the tone frequency to 400 hertz . It 'll increase the radiated modulation depth . Atmospheric noise will screw us . So the signal 's fainter . At least they 'll know we 're out here . [ sighs ] what 's wrong ? The current is not getting high enough . We might as well be shouting into the wind . We put an insulator between the mast and capacity top hat . Already tried that . Not working . Then you 're doing it wrong . Raven . Don 't worry . I 'll fix it . I always do . Try my damn brace ! Your damn brace sucks ! Come on , raven . Elbow grease ain 't gonna fix this . What would you know about elbow grease ? [ grunting ] [ panting ] Wick : Hey , come on . Let 's go back to the work room . We 'll think it through . Leave me alone , wick ! Rrr ! [ bellamy and mel grunting ] Pull , murphy ! Murphy : Aah ! [ screaming ] Come on ! A little help ! Oh , no ! Pull ! Pull ! What the hell is happening up there ? ! Just hold on ! Grounders ! Cover ! Bellamy : How many are there ? We can 't see ' em ! In the trees ! In the trees ! Aim for the trees ! Aah ! No , no , no ! Just hang on . Aah ! We 're gonna need to cut her loose . We can 't do this . Murphy : Bellamy , you got to cut her loose ! No way ! Cut her loose ! [ monroe groaning ] [ foghorn blowing ] Acid fog . Monroe , get back on the rope ! Murphy : Come on ! Thank you . Thank you . We have to take cover from the fog . Octavia : Bellamy . No , we don 't . Murphy : She blew the horn . [ breathlessly ] octavia . [ country music playing ] Wick : Bring me down , reyes . Hey , you know why you 're working on the beacon ? I 'm not . Find someone else . Because i asked for you . You 're the best mechanic we got . Go , me . Exactly 3 mechanics made it to the ground . You were top-3 on the ark , too . I say this even though you refuse To acknowledge the ingenuity of my designs . Stop . Or insanity . Listen , you have a first-rate mind . You do . Use it . Your leg 's messed up , And that blows . Figure out a way to work around it . [ whispers ] how do i do that ? You could let your friends help , for one . The rest , It 's up to you . [ sighs ] What do you know ? It holds . Barely . Oh , whatever ! My design worked ! You can admit it ! Whatever . This thing 's an offense to mechanics everywhere . [ on helium ] you 're welcome . Helium . Argon ! [ normal voice ] what ? Are we not just tossing out noble gases ? No , you idiot ! I know what we have to do to raise the beacon . Zoran . Zoran , please . Come on . Jaha : Come on . Please . And you don 't--you don 't need this for me . I have something for you . What is it ? So you do speak english . Not to strangers . It 's all right . Heh ! Well , we 're not strangers anymore . It 's called a chess piece . The black knight . The game teaches long-term strategy . Taught my son how to play when he was about your age . [ chuckles ] Sienna : Where is your son now ? Dead . I chose different from you . I put my people first . Your people must be very important to you . So was my son . Anya , you 're still bleeding . At least let me bandage it before it gets infected . Clarke : I can find my way home from here . Looks like you 're my prisoner now . You must go ! Quick ! [ grunts ] come with me ! Come with me ! [ panting ] There . [ distant horse neighs softly ] Look at the ridge . [ horse whinnies ] Who are they ? Bad men . They 're coming for you . No one comes to the dead zone . They must have seen you fall from the sky . You have to run , now . If they expect to find me , What happens to you if they don 't ? Go ! Go before they see you . We can take care of ourselves . [ horse whinnies ] [ monroe winces , sighs ] Thank god you came when you did . I was going back to camp when i heard shots . Murphy : Nice foghorn . What happened to your boyfriend ? He 's gone . Murphy : All right . Hey . I 'm sorry , o . The grounders will be back , So we need to go , now . Finn : Yes , we do . Bellamy : Octavia says the arrow might be poisoned . I have to take them home . I know . I 'll meet you as soon as i can . I know . Murphy : Parting , Such sweet sorrow , right ? Where the hell do you think you 're going ? Come on . Bellamy , you know if i go with you , they 'll just lock me up again . Really ? Watch his back . I can 't get them home without you . Of course you can 't . Let 's go . [ clarke panting ] Anya , wait . Aah ! Aah ! Hey- - Aah ! I don 't want to kill you , anya . Then you 're the one that 's gonna die . [ both grunting ] Aah ! [ both panting ] You fought well . Do you see that ? I knew it . He lied . My people are out there . [ overlapping chatter ] So the balloon beacon wasn 't a bad idea . I think the word you 're searching for is " genius . " You should have been an engineer . You already have the arrogance . Oh , that 's what they teach you . I wondered . Sinclair : Well , that 's one way to do it . Byrne : What the hell are you doing ? Oh , it 's a radio beacon . Wrong . It 's a target . Raven : Hey , wait a second ! [ gunshot echoes ] Wick : We fell from space In a football stadium ; i think they already know we 're here . Chancellor kane 's out risking his life To negotiate with the grounders . You better hope he 's successful , because if he isn 't , Every grounder within 50 miles of here Now knows exactly where we are ! I expected better , chief . All guards to the wall , now ! You see a grounder , you 're authorized to shoot on sight ! Man : Yes , ma 'am . Byrne : Let 's go ! Cover the perimeter ! Move ! [ distant horse whinnies ] Zoran : He won 't run ! Please ! They 'll hurt him ! If he runs , they 'll hurt us . Father ? He brought the bad man here ? Mother , why are you doing this ? It 's ok , zoran . Listen to your mother . [ crying ] you can still run ! Please ! If i do , That man will hurt your family , and i won 't let that happen . [ sobbing ] There is a bounty on sky people . " sky people " ? We needed the horse to reach the city of light . [ horse whinnies ] Yeah . To survive , we do what we must . I hope you find your new home . [ zoran sobbing ] [ sniffling ] [ distant horse whinnies ] [ distant , overlapping chatter ] [ both panting ] Clarke : Look at that . How many are there ? I don 't know . A lot , i hope . I 'm letting you go . I 'm not weak , But i 'm not like you . Our only chance against mount weather Is if we fight together . To beat them , we 'll need our technology And your knowledge of this world . I know my people will help . The question is , will yours ? The commander was my second . I can get an audience . Please hurry . [ distant gunshot ] aah ! Anya ! [ gunshot ] Aah ! Hey . Hey , hey , hey . No , no , no , no . No , no . Hey . It 's ok . No . No , no , no . Anya , you 're ok . You 're ok . Aah ! Man : Shot two more . Alpha team 's got two grounders down .

 Alison , help ! I killed Aynsley , Felix . I thought it was her . My husband is my monitor . I 'm sick , Delphine . I 'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment . They 're not clone cells . They 're from a totally different person . Whoever you cloned , do they have niece or even a daughter ? I didn 't think your mom had any sisters . They all look the same but I can tell them apart . Pouch y took my finger . This is piss-off money , okay ? You don 't get to know anything . You 're the one that maced me in the parking lot . Well , I have to make these place settings for Family Day . I could use some help . I 'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix but my charges go away and I 'm done . Six scientists incinerated in a lab explosion . Susan and Ethan Duncan . They were Rachel 's parents , then ? If you think you 're gonna take Duncan back , then you 'll have to kill us both . Leekie wouldn 't let us raise her . He killed Rachel 's mother ! Well , my neighbour Aynsley always thought she was better than me . Yeah , it 's tough the judgment . Yes , and it wasn 't , you know , outright . It was just these little jabs and looks . - I hate people like that . - Mmm-hmm . Yeah . I guess , you know , in that sense , she had it coming . Had what coming ? Oh , just , just an incident . Come on , Ali , unburden yourself . That 's why we 're here . Mmm , no , I can 't . Hey , look at me . You can trust me . There 's stuff that I 've done . No judgment . I slept with her husband , in a parking lot . - Do you think I 'm awful ? - No . - No ? - I think you 're brave . Alison , you 're brave for sharing . - Feels nice , feels good , no ? - Yeah . You know the next step is you have to learn to forgive ... And then I killed her . Well , she was choking and I didn 't stop it . - What , like on a piece of chicken ? - No . Not like on a piece of chicken . I could have saved her and I didn 't . She clawed at the counter-top , begging for her life . I stood there , until it was over . It feels so good to say it out loud . Yeah , I bet . You have been so supportive . I made something . Oh , it 's for me ? Yeah , who else ? Hey , Mr Duncan , is this it ? No , no , I told you . Red box , no label . We simply cannot leave without it . He 's mad , Siobhan . He 's afraid we 'll side with Leekie . Maybe we side with Rachel . After what she 's done ? Rachel is a creature of Dyad . She may know full well that Leekie killed her mother , she might even approve . No , she had those videos of them . It doesn 't mean anything . Well , I don 't know how we use him yet , but I say , we divide and conquer . That 's a good enough strategy , isn 't it ? - Might be , with more facts . - Aha . - Did you find it ? - No . This ... Uh ... Oh ... okay - Oh ... Hello , Detective , it 's me . I got a ... I got something big for you . No , I wanna tell you in person . Listen , DeAngelis , this is not a negotiation . You want Alison Hendrix , you show up tomorrow with my paper work . After I see my charges have been dropped , then I 'll talk . I don 't give a shit what you think . - Mommy ... - Shh . Shh . It 's okay , Kira . Shit ! - You okay ? - Yeah . - Bloody hell ! - Aha ! There it is . What ? That 's just junk . What ? Is that it ? That 's what we 've been looking for ? Thank you . Hey , is Kira all right ? Yeah , she 's fine , but they 're onto me . What ? How ? Computer 's been hacked . Which means they could have my location . But I 'm throwin ' ' em off the trail . Shit ! I 'm ... I 'm coming for her . No , no , I 'm on the move . I 'll call you with the meet-up spot . Are you gonna tell me who your mystery sitter is ? No . I 'm not . I trust you know what 's best for Kira , if you 'll trust me with him . I don 't . Not by a long shot . He 's still my responsibility . Just let me get him to town . We 'll take it from there . Hey . Watch your back with this one . Come on . We have to go . Can you feel that ? Mmm-mmm . Feel that ? - Kinda . - Yea h ? And that ? - The spinal 's working . - Hmm . - We 're gonna begin . - Okay . - Yea h ? - Yeah . She 's inserting it into the uterus , and she 's gonna inject directly into the masses . Hmm . This is the beginning of getting you well , Cosima . Mmm-hmm . Oh ... God . Jesus ! What the ... Oh , wait . - What ? - Felix , we have a problem . What ? Why are you whispering ? Because I 'm not supposed to be using the telephone . Vic is here . - Vic is in rehab ? - Yes . And he 's snitching to a cop called DeAngelis . Wait , wait , wait , Angela DeAngelis ? I can 't go to jail , Felix . I don 't have the temperament . - In the shower , if they touch me , I ... - Alison ... Alison ! Look , I will be there first thing . All right ? Okay - Hey , where 's Kira ? Uh , she 's sleeping . Did anyone follow you ? No , I took side streets and doubled back . All right , I 'm so sorry about this . I don 't know how they found me in the first place . I encrypted everything , I routed all my traffic through anonymous proxies . - I mean , I 'm untraceable . - It 's fine . It wasn 't your fault . But they are trying hard . That tells me Kira 's quite the prize for them . Listen , I have no idea who these aunties are , but , they came with a weird story . She 's just got an over active imagination , Cal . - You sure ? - Yes . - Well , hi ! - Hi ! - Hi , I 'm Cal . - Sarah . Wanna come in ? I 'm not that kind of girl . Yes , you are . - Sarah and Helena were separated . - How ? By a Prolethean , Mark , known to us . And then ? I followed Sarah as instructed and she came up empty . - No sign of the scientist ? - None . You know what this is ? Synthetic amniotic fluid . We 're developing an artificial womb . Bit of a hobby of mine . I like pottery . What have you told Rachel ? I came to you first . What should I tell her ? What you told me Paul , the truth . Thank you . Yes , Dr Leekie . I need to meet with Marion Bowles . It 's an emergency . We really must go now . It 's time . Right then . - Your ... Your box . - Hmm ? - Your mementos . - Ah , yes . We really do have to go . What ? What have we there ? Everything , Mrs Sadler , absolutely everything . Mommy ? Morning , monkey . Mommy . We share a lab , why do we have to keep the source from her ? Because you signed a confidentiality agreement , and I 'm your boss . Is that clear ? Cosima ? What 's going on , Scott ? Um ... You gave me Kira 's stem cells ? Please , listen to me . Leekie set us up . - Us , what ? - Yes . Remember the culture we stumbled upon , the match . Well , he planted it for us to find . You knew it was Kira 's . But only after I realised that it was working . The tests were positive and I had to ... Did you ever stop to think once , that this is my decision and not yours ? There is no decision , Cosima , you have one way forward , and this is it . How did you harvest her ? Kira lost a tooth in her accident , and Leekie procured it from the hospital . It is a finite source . Unless you bring her in for more . Yeah . - Out . - You don 't understand . This is my lab , my body ! I 'm the science . Get out ! Whoa ! Hi ! Hi , could I talk to you for a second ? Yeah , sure , what 's up ? Privately . - Hey , Ali , you ready for Family Day ? - Absolutely . Mmm-hmm . So what 's on your mind ? You selfish , manure bag of a man . - What 's this ? - You are supposed to come to rehab to heal and to grow . You 're not supposed to come to get even sleazier . I opened up to you , Vic . I trusted you . Alison , I 'm honestly sorry . I got a pass , I 'm trying to get out from under . I have to meet DeAngelis this afternoon . And what would your dealer friends say about squeally Vic ? I 'm moving forward and if you knew what was good for you , you 'd do the same . Starting by removing the unsavoury elements from your life . Sarah 's not pleased . - Sarah ? - Mmm-hmm . Is she here ? She 's nearby . - Aldous ? - Marion . Oh , please , tell me your hands have not been soaking in some gruesomely fecund jelly . What I do with my free time is my business , Marion . Please . Ethan Duncan is alive . - How ? - I don 't know . But Sarah Manning tracked him down . Well ... This is a thing . It 's a thing . Well , you know Rachel better than anyone . How do you think she 'll react when she learns the truth ? At one time I would have counted on her to see the big picture . And now ? She 's taking things personally . If Rachel 's become too entangled , we have to step in . She will fight . And she will lose . You know I was just thinking . Our paths rarely cross any more . My misfortune . But when they do , it 's almost always because of Sarah Manning . - We need to look at that . Yeah ? - Hmm . So look , I 've been working on something for the past few days , and I think I might have the answer for us . Okay - Reykjavik . What was the question ? I 'm serious , I have people there . Uh , who 's got people in Iceland ? I can get the paperwork . I got money. just say , Yes - Come on , Cal , it 's not that easy . All right , right on cue , the vague warnings . Look , there are other people involved . Hey , you know I 've tangled with corporate heavies before . - Yeah , not like these . - I know . Point is , I 've made some friends along the way . I 've got contacts , sources ... Some of them are tin foil hat guys , but the chatter about the Dyad group , it 's ... What ? Hey , listen . We 're just gonna do it . We 're just gonna say it out loud . Okay , your big secret . Sarah Manning , I know this may sound crazy , but I think you 're a ... - A Pisces . Am I right ? - You twat . - Yeah , yeah , makes so much sense to me . - Yeah , yeah . Whatever it is I don 't care . Let 's just get out of here . - Yeah ? - Hey , Sarah . Look , we need your help with a little something at rehab . What 's Alison done ? She hurled herself off the wagon ? - No , she ... - Huh ? I am sober as a judge , Sarah . It 's you , your people , your finks and rats and snitches and fuzz . Vic 's here and he 's gonna give me up to the police unless you meet with him . I need you to come here right now and clean up your doo doo . Vic . Come on , come on . Oi . What ? - Where 's Alison ? - Welcoming her family , it 's some kind of public flagellation day . Follow me . Hi ! I 'm here , what do you want ? Victor ? You have the ﬂoor . I have to atone . " Dear Sarah , " you are a rock in my stream , " blocking the ﬂow . " I 'm not getting it , Vic . I have to apologise , okay ? Okay - Good , yeah , fine . Accepted . Wait , I haven 't done it yet . Uh , I atone you , Vic . - You 're atoned , okay . Cool . - Okay ? - We 're done here ? - Whoa , wait a minute , Sarah , you don 't have anything you wanna say to me . After everything , come on , the heartbreak , the finger loss . Okay , you want me to apologise to you ? Which of the twelve steps is that ? Sarah , I wanna have a conversation with you , back and forth , like adults . No . No , no , Vic , we had a deal . You get to say your bit to Sarah and then you stay buttoned-up , regarding Alison 's little bout of criminal negligence . That was not the deal . New deal . - Mom ! - Babies ! Hello , hello . I missed you so much , my little baby . Daddy says you 're coming home soon . Yes , I am . As soon as Daddy deems me fit . - Hey , hey , come on . - Right ? Today 's going to be good , right , nothing to worry about . Can you find your nametag on the table ? - Oh ! - Oh , look at that . - Where 's my nametag ? - Look at that , that is exciting . - Yeah . - Honey , can you pass my nametag ? You know who made them ? Honey , can you pass my nametag ? - Relax . - Sarah , you always do this to me . You always keep yourself at a distance , you never let me in . Well , no wonder , with those giant banana hands . For the love of Buddha , could you please stay out of this . Listen , listen , hey , Vic , look I apologise . - Okay . - Really truly . - We were two colliding train wrecks . - Yeah . Okay - Sarah , I 've been doing a lot of the work . - I 've been reading . - Great . Yeah , that 's good . - I 'm getting a lot better . - Good for you . - Thank you . - Good luck . I want you back . - Oh dear God ! - Piss off , Vic ! Listen , I 've changed , all right ? Let me prove it to you . - Not happening , it 's not happening . - Why ? Why , don 't tell me that nail gun Ken is still in the picture . No , but you should see the new one . There 's a new one ? - Felix ! - What ? Those guys , they 're not you . I 'm you . I stand ... Jesus Christ ! Okay , look ... What I 'm trying to say is this . Do you smell salt ? Oh ! What the he " ' gust happened ? I may have spiked his tea . If you 've done your homework , I shouldn 't have to introduce myself . Siobhan Sadler . I have to say I 'm pretty impressed you 'd come here . I have something you want . My favourite kind of visitor . Please ... Have a seat . I have the early research of Professors Susan and Ethan Duncan . Key formulas , methodology sequences , a summary on disc . Where did you get it ? It 's your missing science , Dr Leekie . What is it worth to you ? Well , that depends . I 'd need to authenticate it with Duncan himself . I give you Duncan , you give up on Kira , and we disappear once and for all . You drop your hunt . What about Sarah ? Sarah , sadly , insists on fending for herself . But the child deserves better . Christ , he looks like he was molested by elves . What did you give him ? Benzodiazepine . In small doses it 's perfectly recreational . Let 's ... Sorry . God , he weighs a tonne . S , what 's wrong ? Nothing for once . I was fact checking . Seems safe to assume Rachel doesn 't know Leekie killed her mother . What , how do you know that ? He told me , not in so many words . He does want Duncan silent , and all the science to himself . Wait , you talked to Leekie ? Divide and conquer , Sarah . But if we drop this bomb on Rachel , there 's no telling which one of them will fall . I 'm good with either one . Let 's blow up their shit . Then I 'll set it up . - Alison ! - Oh , damn it to hell . Uh , yep . Mmm-hmm . What you doing ducking out ? You volunteered . Mmm-hmm , yeah . Okay , come on . Alison , do I have to drag you out of there ? - Alison ! - Mmm-hmm . Coming . Bollocks ! Have you seen Victor ? Mmm-mmm , nope . Great ! Oh , my God ! What is this ? What ... You 're welcome . Thanks to me , he 's gonna miss his meeting with DeAngelis . No , no , he can 't be here . There 's family tours after the assembly . They 're coming to this room . - Oh , bollocks ! - Oh ! So , we 're all gonna be nice to Mommy , all right ? Okay ? Come on . Hello , everyone , okay ! Hello , please take your seats , we 're gonna get started now . Great to see you all shining faces here today . Alison , we have a seat in the front row , come on . - Ali , hi ! - As is the custom on Family Day , the group has chosen a resident to make some opening remarks . Ladies and gentlemen , Alison Hendrix . Oh , shit ! Hey , Mom . Hello , kids . Thank you all for coming today . Not that any of us really had any choice , I guess . So , um ... We stand among you today , pill poppers and booze hounds , hop heads , tweekers , rummies ... Alison . Right . Where in the bloody hell are we going ? Come on , we need to get him downstairs . Trust me , I have a plan . Christ on a log , the man 's made of cement . - Oh ! - Hurry up , Felix , I need to make it to the assembly for the role-playing demonstration . The what ? Role-playing - - Let 's begin . - Okay . Hello , everyone . Oh , he 's being Alison . - That 's right . - And I 'm being Alison being Donnie ? Uh , this teaches you to see things from your partner 's point of view . So , Donnie , what 's on your mind ? Um , uh ... Don 't stammer , Donnie , and stand up straight , or I 'll withhold affection . Engage him , Alison . Make eye contact . - Donnie , look at me . - Yeah . Alison , I think you should come home to your family . No , Donnie , because I , Alison , need supervision . That sounds about right . Uh , I 'm Donnie and I like to spy on my wife and monitor her every move . Now , wait a minute , you 're just using my voice for your words . Well , maybe you should listen to Alison 's words a little more often , - Donnie . - Okay , is she doing this right ? You do seem to be blocking , Alison . No , he 's the one who 's blocking her . Her ... It 's what you do . Now , who are you being ? I really have to tinkle . Go , go back ! Back , back . Shit ! His phone . Get his phone . Get his phone . Vic ? Quit screwing around , Vic . What were you thinking ? - How could you go in there ? - Jesus , I 'm done with glitter . I didn 't have a choice , did I ? - Where 's Vic ? - Sorted , for now . This is a disaster . Give me that . Piss-off . Alison ? - What ? - Yes . Relax , Donnie . It 's Sarah Manning . The runaway clone . So , I guess you 'll be running off to call Dr Leekie , hmm ? Clone ? I don 't think he knows , Alison . Of course he knows , he 's a monitor . No , darling , I think Sarah 's right . This kind of cluelessness can 't be faked . Vic , I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , but you better call me , now . On-duty nurse , please come to the reception area . You can 't be serious . Must 've been the pressure of Family Day . Hello , Paul . Do come in . You have 15 minutes . Once you 've gone , your father will remain here . If anybody moves against this house , I will put a bullet in his head . Are we clear ? Rachel . My dear , dear Rachel . Hello , Father . I can hardly believe it 's been 20 years , Rachel . So , how is Dr Leekie ? Making his own moves , I 'm sure . You don 't know the truth about your mother , do you ? What Rachel 's gonna learn is gonna force both of their hands . I can see where Sarah gets it . Her knack for burning things down . Please forgive me . You have to believe me . I had no idea . What did you think you were doing ? You remember Sociology 201 , with that Prof ? What 's his name , with the cleft palate ? He recruited me into a study . A study ? Long term social metrics . They told me it was totally benign , but subjects had to remain completely unaware . So when men came in vanloads at night with their gloves and their probes , was that benign ? What men ? You destroyed us , Donnie , with the spying and the lies . I love you so much , and you ruined our family . You 're so stupid you don 't even know why . My father sends his regards . It 's important you think very carefully about your next steps , Rachel . Or what ? I 'll die in a fire ? Ethan and Susan Duncan left us no choice . Oh , please , by salting your Petri dishes . Yes . They set the science back decades . When they tried to run away with you , I intervened . Your task now , is to put it behind you and do not fight . It won 't end well for you . It 's already over , Aldous . Rachel , is it done ? It 's in motion . Not a happy task , I know . He was your mentor . Yes , he was . But he lost his way with Sarah Manning . Hmm . Serves us right really , putting a lab coat in the big chair . Let me know when it 's done , yeah ? - Rachel ... - Go now . Rachel ... Don 't get in your car , don 't go home . You might survive . Thank you . It 's foolish to spare you , but you raised me . Nurture prevails . Hey . Hey , Sarah ' ? Hey , Cos , what 's going on ? I really hate to make this call . But it 's about all of us . And it 's about Kira . Why does she need Kira 's tooth ? Cal ... What the hell ? I don 't know , she 's sick , Cal . This is one of the aunts you won 't tell me about ? Yes . Yes . So we 've been running away from Dyad and now you wanna take Kira in to have them , what , harvest her ? I don 't know , Cal , okay . She 's sick . Kira might be her only chance . Don 't do this to our kid . Kira ? Will this help ? Oh , God , monkey . Shit ! It was already loose . Whatever this is , it 's gonna swallow you both . Oh , Kira ! It 's not your decision . We have to go back . Yeah , let 's get this . The number we practised , you still remember it ? Yeah . Okay , good . You call it any time , okay ? You need me , I 'll be there . No matter what . Okay - - I 'm sorry . Don 't worry . - Yeah , see you . See you . Taxi , taxi . Hey ! Hey , come on ! Dr Leekie , I need a word . Another time , Donnie . Get in ! Jesus . You lied to me . No , I offered you a chance to be part of something special . Well , it 's not right , all the secrets . Donnie , it 's late . You came into my house , and probed my wife . Listen to me , you turnip . In a hundred years ' time , no one will care in any way about Donnie Hendrix , except as a footnote in this experiment . You ruined my marriage , my wife hates me . I gave you your wife . Put the gun away and go home to bed . I won 't participate any more . Thank you . I quit ! Oh , God . Oh , God . Where is Aldous ? Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets . They wanna make more of us ? They tried and tried . I 'm leaving . Just picks up and abandons his kids in the middle of the night . You have to find Beth Childs . You are running out of time . Cosima ! Ripped By mstoll

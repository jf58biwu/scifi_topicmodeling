 My dad was a farmer . Like everybody else back then . Of course he didn 't start that way . The computer says you 're too tight . No , I got this ! - Crossing the Straits . I 've got to shut it down Cooper . - Heyyy . Shutting all down ... - Hey , we do not have to shut down anything ! Dad ? Sorry Murph . Go back to bed babe . I thought you were the ghost . There 's no such thing as a ghost babe . - Grandpa says that you can get ghosts . No , that 's because grandpa is too close to being one himself . Go back to bed . Were you dreaming about the crash ? Get your butt back in bed Murph . The wheat had died . The blight came and we had to burn it . We still had corn . We had acres of corn . But mostly we had dust . I guess I can 't describe it . It was just constant . Just that , steady blow of dirt . We wore little strips of sheet sometimes over our nose and mouth . So we wouldn 't breathe so much of it . Well when we set the table we always set the plate upside down . Glasses or cups , whatever it was , upside down . Shake a leg . Murph , get your move on . - One o 'clock today , you and me in the barn , Herbicide Resistance 101 , check ? - Yessir . Not at the table Murph ! Dad , can you fix this ? What the heck did you do to my lander ? - It wasn 't me . Let me guess . It was your ghost . - It knocked it off my shelf . It also knocks the books off . - There 's no such thing as ghosts dumbass . Hey . - I looked it up , it 's called a poltergeist . Dad , tell her . - Well , that 's not very scientific Murph . You said that science was about admitting what we don 't know . - She 's got you there . Hey , start looking after all our stuff . Coop . Alright Murph , you wanna talk science ? Don 't just tell me that you 're afraid of some ghost . No , you gotta go further . You have to record the facts , analyze get to the how and the why and present your conclusions . Deal ? Deal . - All right ! Have a good day at school . - Hold up . Parent-Teacher conferences , parent , not grandparent . Slow down turbo . That 's not a dust storm . Nelson 's torching his whole crop . - Blight ? They 're saying it 's the last harvest for okra . Ever . He should have planted corn like the rest of us . - Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley . She 's single . - Well what 's that supposed to mean ? Repopulating the Earth . - Start pulling your weight young man . Why don 't you start minding your own business ? Old man ! All right Murph give me second . Aha , ... . thirrrd . Find a gear dumbass . - Grind it ! - Shut it Tom ! Whatcha do Murph ? - Ahh , she didn 't do nothing . Blew a tire is all . - Murphy 's Law . - Shut up ! Grab the spare Tom . - That is the spare . Get the patch kit . And how am I supposed to patch it out here ? You 'll have to figure it out . I 'm not always gonna be here to help you . What 's goin ' on Murph ? Why did you and mom name me after something that 's bad ? - No we didn 't ? Murphy 's Law ? Murphy 's Law doesn 't mean that something bad will happen . What it means is whatever can happen will happen . And that sounded just fine with us . Get in . Get in , let 's go . What about the flat tire ? Yes . It is an Indian Air Force drone . Solar cells could power an entire farm . Take the wheel Tom . Go , go go ! Keep it pointed at that . Faster Tom , we 're losing it . - Yes . Point right at it . Hang on , here we go , here we go . Nice driving Tom . Dad ? - Almost got it , don 't stop , don 't stop . Dad ? ! Tom ! Wha .. ? You told me to keep driving . Well I guess that answers the ol 'if I ask you to drive off a cliff ' scenario . We lost it . - No we didn 't ! Wanna give it a whirl ? Let 's land it down there , right at the edge of the reservoir . Nicely done ! How long do you think it 's been up there ? Delhi Mission Control went down same as ours , 10 years ago . So for 10 years ? Why 'd it come down so low ? - I don 't know . Maybe the sun cooked it 's brain or it was looking for something . - What ? Give me that large flatblade Maybe some kind of signal . I don 't know . What are you gonna do with it ? I 'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do like driving a combine . - Can 't we just , let it go ? It wasn 't hurting anybody . Listen , this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph , like the rest of us . So how 's this work ? Do you guys come with ? - I 've got class . This one , needs to wait . What did you do ? - They 'll tell you about it when you get in there . Well am I gonna be mad ? - Not with me . Just please , try not to . Hey , relax ... . I got this . You 're late Coop . - Yeah , we had a flat . And I guess you had to stop off at Asian fighter plane store . No actually sir , that 's a , that 's a surveillance drone . With outstanding solar cells . It 's Indian . - Take a seat . So , we got Tom 's scores back . He 's gonna make an excellent farmer . - Yeah he 's got a knack for it . What about college ? Well the university only takes a handful . They don 't really have the resources . - I still pay my taxes . Where does that money go ? There 's no more armies . Well , they don 't go to the university . Look Coop , you have to be realistic . You 're ruling my son out for college now ? The kid 's 15 . Tom 's score simply isn 't high enough . - What 's your waistline ? How about 32 , about 33 inseam ? - I 'm not sure I see where you 're getting at . You 're telling me it takes two numbers to measure your own ass but only one to measure my son 's future ? Come on , you 're a well-educated man Coop and a trained pilot . - And an engineer . Okay well right now , we don 't need more engineers . We didn 't run out of television screens or planes ; we ran out of food ! The world needs farmers . Good farmers like you , and Tom . Uneducated farmers . - We are a caretaker generation Coop . And things are getting better . Maybe your grandkids will get to be ... - Are we done here sir ? No . Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph . Murph is a great kid , she 's really bright . But she 's been having a little trouble lately . She brought this in to show the other students . The section on the lunar landings . Yeah , it 's one of my old textbooks . She always loved the pictures . It 's an old federal textbook . We 've replaced them with the corrected versions . Corrected ? - Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union . You don 't believe we went to the Moon ? I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda that the Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines . Useless machines ? And if we don 't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century then we need to teach our kids about this planet . Not tales of leaving it . Y 'know one of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI . And if we had any of those left , the doctors would 've been able to find the cyst in my wife 's brain before she died ; instead of afterwards . And then she would have been the one sitting here listening to this instead of me which would 've been a good thing because she was always the ... the calmer one . I 'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper . But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this Apollo nonsense . So we thought it would be best to bring you in and see what ideas you might have for dealing with her behaviour on the home front . Yeah , you know what , there 's a game tomorrow night . She 's going through a bit of a baseball phase , her favorite team is playing . There 's gonna be candy and soda I think I 'll take her to that . How 'd it go ? - I got you suspended . What ? - Cooper . This is Cooper , go . - Coop , those combines you rebuilt went haywire . Just reset the controllers . - I did that , but you should come take a look . One by one they just teared off the fields and headed over . something 's interfering with the compass . Magnetism . Or somethin ' such . There 's nothing special about which book . I 've been working on it , like you said . I counted the spaces . - Why ? In case the ghost is trying to communicate . I 'm trying Morse . Morse ? - Yeah , dots and dashes . It 's ... I know what Morse code is Murph . But I still don 't think your bookshelf is trying to talk to you . Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset off the anomaly . Which is ? - I don 't know . Now if the house had been built on magnetic ore we would have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor . I hear your meeting at the school didn 't go so well . You heard ? It 's like we 've forgotten who we are , Donald . Explorers , pioneers , not caretakers . When I was a kid , it felt like they made something new everyday . Some gadget or idea . Like every day was Christmas . But 6 , billion people , Just try to imagine that . And every last one of them trying to have it all . This world isn 't so bad . And Tom will do just fine . You 're the one who doesn 't belong . Born 40 years too late or 40 years too early . My daughter knew it . God bless her . And your kids know it , especially Murph . Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder at our place in the stars . Now we just look down , and worry about our place in the dirt . Cooper , you were good at something , and you never got a chance to do anything with it . I 'm sorry . You didn 't expect this dirt that was giving you this food to turn on you like that and destroy you . In April I believe if I 'm right , 15th of April I , I think . This just happened at about 1 : 30 when that thing came off the top of the canyon . In my day we had real ball players . Who 're these bums ? Well in my day , people were too busy fighting over food to even play baseball . Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural . I want a hot dog . School says you 're gonna follow in my footsteps . I think that 's great . You think that 's great ? You hate farming dad . Grandpa said . Grandpa said huh ? Listen , all that matters is how you feel about it . I like what you do . I like our farm . And you 're gonna be great at it . Let 's get outta here . All right it 's a doozy . Alright gang , lets mask up . Tom , Murph ? - Check . - Check ? Murph , Tom , you guys shut your windows ? Murph . The ghost . - Grab your pillow . You 're sleeping with Tom . It 's not a ghost . It 's gravity . I 'm dropping Tom , then heading into town . You wanna clean that up ? When you 've finished praying to it . It 's not Morse Murph , it 's binary . Thick is 1 , thin is 0 . Coordinates . That 's it . - I can 't miss this . Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph . But you don 't know what you 're gonna find . And that , is why I can 't take you . Murph ? Grandpa will be home in a while , tell him I 'll call him on the radio . Jesus ! What 're you doing ? Oh d 'you think it 's funny ? Huh ? You wouldn 't be here if it wasn 't for me . Make yourself useful . Hey Murph . Murph . I think this is the end of the road . Didn 't you bring the bolt cutters ? That 's my girl . Step away from the fence . - Don 't shoot , don 't shoot . I 'm unarmed . My daughter is in the car . Don 't be afraid . How did you find this place ? - Where is my daughter ? You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map . Where did you get those coordinates ? Where is my daughter ? ! - Don 't make me take you down again , sit down ! Oh d 'you still think you 're a Marine pal ? Marines don 't exist . And you know what ? I 've got grunts like you mowing my grass . Where did you find those coordinates ? - Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower no , I think I 'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum or a dry cleaner . No you won 't . TARS , back down please . You 're taking a risk using ex-military security . They are old and their control units are unpredictable . It 's what the government could spare . Who are you ? - Dr . Brand . Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once , he was a Professor . - What makes you think I 'm not ? Wasn 't near as cute either . Please Dr. Brand , I don 't have any idea what this is . But I 'm scared for my daughter , and I want her by my side . You give me that , and I 'll tell you anything you want to know . Take the principal and the girl to the conference room . Your daughter is fine . Bright kid . Must have a very smart mother . - It 's pretty clear you don 't want any visitors . Why don 't you let us back up from your fence and we 'll be on our way , huh ? It 's not that simple . - Well , sure it is . Look I don 't know anything about you . I don 't know anything about this place . Yes you do . Dad ! Hello Cooper . Professor Brand . Explain to me how you found this facility . Kind of accidently stumbled upon it . We were on a salvage run ... You 're sitting in the best kept secret in the world . Nobody stumbles in here , nobody stumbles out . Cooper , please , cooperate with these people . Well , it 's kinda hard to explain . We we .. , we learnt these coordinates from an anomaly . - What sort of anomaly ? I hesitate to term it supernatural but it damn well wasn 't scientific ... You 're gonna have to be specific Mr. Cooper , right now . - It was gravity . Um what sort of gravitational an - where was this thing ? Hey , I 'm real happy that you 're excited about gravity bud , but you 're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances . - Assurances ? - Yeah . Like that we 're getting out of here , and I don 't mean in the trunk of some car . Don 't you know who we are Coop ? - No Professor , I don 't . You know my father Professor Brand . We 're NASA . NASA . - NASA . The same NASA , you flew for . I heard they shut you down sir , for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere on the starving people . When they realized that killing other people was not a long term solution , then they needed us back . In secret . Why secret ? - Because public opinion wouldn 't allow spending on space exploration . Not when you 're struggling to put food on the table . Blight . Wheat , seven years ago . Okra , this year . - Now , there 's just corn . And we 're growing more than we ever had . Yeah , but like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl the corn will die . Soon . We 'll find a way , Professor , we always have . Driven by the unshakeable faith that the Earth is ours ? Well not just ours , no . But it is our home . Earth 's atmosphere is 80 % nitrogen . We don 't even breathe nitrogen . Blight does , and as it thrives , our air gets less and less oxygen . The last people to starve , will be the first to suffocate . And your daughter 's generation will be the last to survive on Earth . Murph is feeling a little tired , and was wondering if she could take a nap in my office ? Yeah , thank you . Okay . Now you need to tell me , what your plan is to save the world ? We 're not meant to save the world . We 're meant to leave it . Rangers . - The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit . The Endurance . Our final expedition . You sent people out there looking for a new home ? The Lazarus missions . - Sounds cheerful ! Lazarus came back from the dead . - Sure , but he had to die in the first place . There 's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life and the nearest star is over a 1000 years away . I mean , it doesn 't even qualify as futile . Where did you send them ? Cooper , I can 't tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft . You 're the best pilot we ever had . - I barely left the stratosphere . This team never left the simulator ! We need a pilot , and this is the mission that you were trained for . What , without even knowing ? An hour ago , you didn 't even know I was alive , and you were going anyway . We had no choice . But something sent you here . They chose you . - Who 's ' They ' ? How long , would I be gone ? - Hard to know . Years . - I 've got kids Professor . Get out there , and save them . Who 's ' They ' ? - We started detecting gravitational anomalies , almost 50 years ago . Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere . In fact I believe you encountered one yourself . Yeah , in the Straits . My crash , something tripped my fly-by-wire . Exactly . But of all these anomalies , the most significant is this . Out near Saturn . A disturbance of spacetime . Is that a wormhole ? - It appeared 48 years ago . And it leads , where ? - Another galaxy . A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon . Someone placed it there . - ' They ' ? And whoever they are , they appear to be looking out for us . That wormhole let 's us travel to other stars . It came right around when we needed it . They 've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach . Twelve , in fact from our initial probes . - You sent probes into that ? We sent people into it , 10 years ago . The Lazarus missions . 12 possible worlds , 12 Ranger launches . Carrying the bravest humans ever to live . Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann . Each person 's landing pod had enough life support for two years . But they could use hibernation to stretch that making observations on organics over a decade or more . Their mission was to assess their world and if it showed potential , then they could send out a signal and bed down for the long nap wait to be rescued . - And what if the world didn 't show promise ? Hence the bravery . You don 't have the resources to visit all 12 . - No . Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary . Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential . One system shows promise . Well one , that 's a bit of a long shot isn 't it ? One system with 3 potential worlds ? Not a long shot . Wait . So if we find a home then what ? - That 's the long shot . There is a plan A , and a plan B. Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber ? This entire facility is a centrifuge . Some kind of vehicle ? A space station ? - Both . The plan A. How do you get it off the ground ? The first gravitational anomalies changed everything . Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real . So I started working on a theory and we started building this station . - But you haven 't solved it yet . That 's why there 's a plan B. The problem is gravity . How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet ? This is one way . The plan B. Population bomb . Over 5000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos . How would you raise ' em ? - With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten . After that , with surrogacy the growth becomes exponential . In 30 years , we could have a colony of hundreds . The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity . This will take care of that . Yeah , but what about the people here ? You just , you 'd give up on ' em ? My kids ? - That 's why Plan A is a lot more fun . How far have you got ? - Almost there . You 're asking me to hang everything on an ' almost ' . - I 'm asking you to trust me . Find us a new home . And by the time you return , I would 've solved the problem of gravity . I give you my word . Go away ! Murph . - Go . If you 're leaving just go ! This world was never enough for you , was it Cooper ? What , cause heading out there is what I feel like ... ... I was born to do ? And it excites me ? Nah , it does not make it wrong . - It might . Don 't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason . The ' why ' of the thing , that 's the foundation . - And the foundation 's solid . We farmers , we sit here every year when the rains fail , and we say : Next year . Well , next year ain 't gonna save us , nor the one after that . This world 's a treasure Donald , but it 's been telling us to leave for a while now . Mankind was born on Earth , it was never meant to die here . Tom will be alright , but you got to make things right with Murph . - I will . Without making promises you don 't know you can keep . You have to talk to me Murph . I need to fix this before I go . Then I 'll keep it broken so you 'll have to stay . After you kids came along , your mom , she said something to me I never quite understood . She said : Now , we 're just here to be the memories for our kids . I think I now understand what she meant . Once you 're a parent , you 're the ghost of your children 's future . You said ghosts didn 't exist . That 's right Murph . Look at me . I can 't be your ghost right now . I need to exist . They chose me . Murph , they chose me . You saw it . You 're the one who led me to ' em . And that 's exactly why you can 't go ! I figured out the message . One word . You know what it is ? Murph . - STAY . It says STAY dad . - Murph . You don 't believe me ! Look at the books . Look it says STAY . Why are you not listening ? IT SAYS STAY ! - I 'm coming back . When ? One for you . One for me . When I 'm up there in hypersleep , or , or traveling at the speed of light , or , near a black hole , Time is gonna change for me . And it 's gonna run more slowly . So , when we get back , we 're gonna compare . - Time will run differently for us ? Yeah . Maybe by the time I get back , you and I , we might be the same age . You and me . What ? Imagine that ! Ah , Murph . - You 've no idea when you 're coming back ! No idea at all ! - Murph . Murph , don 't ma - , don 't make me leave like this . Murph ! Don 't make me leave like this Murph ! Hey , ... I love you . You hear me ? I love you forever . And I 'm coming back . I 'm coming back . How did it go ? - Fine . Just fine . I love you Tom . - Travel safe , okay ? - Yeah . Take care of our place for me alright ? Huh ? - Uh huh . Hey , can I use your truck while you 're gone ? - You mean your truck ? I 'll make sure they bring it back . Look after my kids Donald . Go for main engines . Start T minus 10 . Dad ! - 9 - Dad ! 8 , 7 . - DAD ! 6 , 5 . Main engines start . 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Booster ignition , and . All engines look good . Beginning roll program . Prepare for stage one separation . Stage one . Everybody good ? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony ? They gave him a humor setting , to fit in better with his unit . He thinks it relaxes us . - A giant sarcastic robot ! What a great idea ! - I have a cue light I could use when I 'm joking , if you 'd like ? That wouldn 't be a problem , no . Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship after I blow you out the air lock . What 's your humor setting TARS ? 100 % - Let 's bring it down to 75 please . Stage two separation . All feeds going manual . - Going manual . Deactivate probe heater 1 , 2 and 3 . - Check . Taking control . - This is handover to you . ABF check . Over . Retro thrusters fuel cells 1 , 2 , 3 . 100 % ex-mites . It 's hard leaving everything . My kids . Your father . - We 're gonna be spending a lot of time together , - We should learn to talk . - And when not to . Just being honest . - Well you don 't need to be that honest . Hey TARS , what 's your honesty parameter ? - 90 % 90 % ? Absolute honesty isn 't always the most diplomatic nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings . - Okay ! 90 % it is Dr. Brand . We 're coming up on the Endurance . 12 minutes out . Okay taking control . Approaching module port , 500 meters . It 's all you Doyle . Nice and easy Doyle , nice and easy . Take us home . Target locked . Target locked . - Well done . - Okay , helmets on . Good job . The door is not charging . Never mind ! Cooper , you should have control . - Control here . Communication with ring module active . That 's initiate . Are we ready to spin ? - Just a sec . Hello CASE . - Hello TARS . Okay , we 're all set . - All right let 's do it . 30 % of spin . One g . How is gravity treating you back there ? Romilly , hey you okay ? - Yeah . - You all right ? Yeah , no I just need a minute . Okay , I think we have some dramamine in the hibe pad , I 'm just gonna go get that . It 'll be in the cryo beds Just be a sec . - Hey Brand ? Yeah ? - Bring a lot . Amelia , be safe . Give my regards to Dr. Mann . - I will Dad . It looks good for your trajectory . We 've calculated , two years to Saturn . That 's a lot of Dramamine . Look after my family will you please , sir ? We 'll be waiting for you , when you get back . A little older , a little wiser , but happy to see you . 'Do not go gentle into that good night , ' 'old age should burn and rave at close of day , ' 'Rage , rage against the dying of the light . ' 'Though wise men at their end , know dark is right . ' 'Because their words had forked no lightning they 'Do not go gentle , into that good night 'Rage , rage against the dying of the light . ' Here , pills . So alone . - We have each other . Dr. Mann had it worse . I mean them . It 's a perfect planet and we 're not gonna find another one like it . No , it 's not like , looking for a new condo . The human race is going to be , adrift . Desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches it 's breath . We need to find that rock , and our 3 prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life . Laura Miller 's planet is the first . Laura started our biology program . Wolf Edmunds is here . - Tell me about Edmunds . Oh , um , Wolf 's a particle physicist . Any of them had any families ? No , no attachments . My father insisted . They 'all knew the possibility of seeing another human being again . I 'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them . Dr. Mann ? - Dr . Mann , well , he 's remarkable . He 's the best of us . He inspired 11 people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history . Scientists , explorers . That 's what I love . Y 'know out there , we would face great odds . Death . But , not evil . You don 't think nature can be evil ? No . Formidable , frightening . But , no , not evil . Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds ? Just what we take with us then ? Yeah . This crew represents the best of humanity . Even me , huh ? - Y 'know what ? We agreed , 90 % . Don 't stay up . I 'll be in a minute . Just remember Coop , you 're literally wasting your breath . Hey TARS , let 's go over that trajectory one more time . 8 months to Mars . Gravity powered slingshot around , 14 months to Saturn . Nothing has changed on that . Let me ask you something . Dr. Brand and Edmunds . - Why are you whispering ? They can 't hear you . Dr. Brand and Edmunds , they close ? - I wouldn 't know . Is that ' 90 % wouldn 't know ' or ' 10 % wouldn 't know ' ? I also have a discretion setting Cooper . But not a poker-face slick . Hey guys . Dad 's about to go down for the long nap . and I just , wanted to give you an update . The Earth looks amazing from here . You can 't see any of the dust . I really hope you guys are doin ' , doin ' great . I know you 're gonna get this message , Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you . Alright , okay I love you ! Is it him ? - I don 't think so Murph . You must be Donald . Hello Murph . - Why are you in my dad 's truck ? He wanted me to bring it for your brother . He sent you a message . She 's pretty upset with him for leaving . If you record any messages I can get them transmitted to Cooper . Murph is a bright spark . Maybe , I should fan the flame . She 's already making fools of her teachers , well , maybe she should come and make a fool out of you . So where are they ? - Heading for Mars . The next time you hear from Cooper , they 'll be coming up on Saturn . They want me to repeat plant pathology . It sucks . But , they said I could start advanced agriculture a year early . So ... alright . Well , I gotta go Dad . Hope you 're safe up there . Sorry Coop , I asked Murph to say hi . But she 's as stubborn as her old man . I 'll try again next time . Are you okay Rom ? This gets to me Cooper . This , this . Millimeters of aluminum protecting us and then nothing out there for millions of miles , won 't kill us in seconds . Did you know that some of the finest solo yatchsmen in the world don 't know how to swim ? They don 't know , and if they go overboard , it 's done . We are explorers Rom . This is our boat . Here . This is the , relay probe ? - In orbit around the wormhole . This is the wormhole and every time we come around we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy . Like swinging a periscope around . - Exactly . So we got a pretty good idea , what we 're gonna find on the other side , huh ? Navigationally . Hey guys , looks like we 're gonna be approaching the wormhole in about three hours . Hey Coop , can we stop the spinning ? Why ? - Because we are close enough to see it . Aha . Look , that 's , that 's it ! That 's the wormhole ! Say it , don 't spray it Rom . It 's a sphere . Well of course it is ! What you thought it would just be a hole ? No . It 's just that all the illustrations I 've ever seen they ... The illustrations , try to show how it works . So they say you want to go from here , to there . But this is too far . So a wormhole bends space like this so you can take a shortcut through a higher dimension . Okay so , to show that they 've turned 3-dimensional space into 2 dimensions , which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions a circle . What 's a circle in 3 dimensions ? A sphere . - Exactly . A spherical hole . But who put it there ? Who do we have to thank ? I 'm not thanking anybody until we get outta here in one piece Rom . Any trick to this Doyle ? No one knows . The others made it , right ? At least some of ' em . Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system ? To our galaxy . Here we go . Controls won 't work here . We are passing through the bulk . Its space beyond our 3 dimensions . All you can do is report and observe . What is that ? I think it 's ' Them ' . - Distorting spacetime ? Don 't . Don 't ! What was that ? First handshake . We 're ... We 're here . So the lost communications came through . - How ? The relay on this side cached them . It 's years of basic data , no real surprises . Miller 's site has kept pinging ' thumbs up ' , as has Dr. Mann 's . Edmunds went down three years ago . - Transmitter failure ? Maybe . He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark . But Miller 's still looks good though , right ? Because she 's coming up fast . But there 's one complication . The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought . Gargantua ? - It 's what we 're calling the black hole . Miller 's and Dr. Mann 's planets both orbit it . And Miller 's is on the horizon ? - Like a basketball around a hoop . Landing there takes us dangerously close and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull . Okay I - , I could swing around that neutron star ... - No no no , it 's not that , it 's time . The gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to Earth 's , .. drastically . Well how bad ? Well , every hour we spend on that planet will be , uhh , seven years back on Earth . Jesus . - That 's relativity folks . Well , we can 't just drop down there without ... - Cooper ... We have a mission . - Yeah Doyle , we have a mission . And our mission , Plan A is to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on the Earth right now . You can 't just think about your family , now you have to think bigger than that , alright ? I 'm thinking about my family and millions of other families . Okay , Plan A does not work , if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off . No , it doesn 't . That 's why there 's a Plan B. Okay . Cooper 's right . We have to think about time as a resource just like oxygen and food . Going down there is gonna cost us . Okay look , Dr. Mann 's data is promising , alright , but it 's gonna take us months to get there , and Edmunds , it 's even further . Now Miller hasn 't said much . But what she has said is very promising . It 's water , it 's organics . - You don 't find that everyday . No , you don 't and just think about the resources including time that would be spent trying to get back here . Romilly . - Yeah . How far off of Miller 's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift ? Alright , just back from the cusp . - Which is here , just outside of Miller 's planet . Alright . Okay . Here 's Gargantua , here 's Miller 's planet . Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller 's planet , which would conserve fuel , but we 'd lose a lot of time , what if , what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua , parallel with Miller 's planet , outside of it 's time shift , to here . Then we take the Ranger down , we get Miller , we get her samples , we come back , we analyze , we debrief we 're in , we 're out , we lose a little fuel . But we save a lot of time . That 'll work . - That 's good . - There 's not gonna ... be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there , so TARS , you should definitely stay here . CASE , you 're with me . Anyone else can stay . If we are talking about a couple of years , I could use the time to research gravity , observations from the wormhole , that 's gold to Professor Brand . TARS , factor an orbit around Gargantua , conserve fuel , minimize thrusting . Make sure we stay in range from Miller 's planet . You got it ? I wouldn 't leave you behind , Dr. Brand . You ready CASE ? - Yep . - You don 't say much do you ? TARS talks plenty for both of us . - Detach . Romilly , are you reading these forces ? - Unbelievable . A literal heart of darkness . If we could just see the collapsed star inside , the singularity , we 'd solve gravity . We can 't get anything from it ? - Nothing escapes that horizon , not even light . All the answers are there , just no way to see it . There 's Miller 's planet . Goodbye Ranger . This is fast for atmospheric entry . Shouldn 't we use the thrusters to slow ? - No . I 'm gonna use the Ranger 's aerodynamics to save some fuel . Air-brake ? - We wanna get down fast don 't we ? Actually we wanna get there in one piece . - Hang on . Brand , Doyle , get ready . We should be using the air-brake . - Hands up CASE . The only time I ever went down is when a machine was easing at the wrong time . You 're going to get us killed . - Just like reckless driving . We 're too fast . - I got this . Should I get ready to detach ? - No . I need to feel the air . Here we go . It 's just water ! The stuff of life . - 1200 meters . Do we have a fix on her beacon ? - That I have , can you maneuver ? I gonna need to shave some speed . I 'm gonna spiral down on top of it , everybody hang on ! 700 . On my cue CASE , on my cue . 500 meters . Now ! Very graceful . No , but very efficient . What 're you waiting for ? Let 's go . Go , go , go , go . 7 years per hour here . Let 's make it count . This way . About 200 meters . Gravity 's punishing . - Been floating through space too long ? 130 % Earth 's gravity . Come on , come on , come on . There 's nothing here . - should be right here . If the , if the signal 's coming from here , then ... Her beacon . Wreckage . - Where 's the rest ? Towards the mountains . Those aren 't mountains . They 're waves . - What ? Shit . That one 's moving away from us . We need the recorder . Brand , Doyle , back to the Ranger now ! I 'm not , leaving , without , her data . Get back here now . We do not have time . The second wave is coming ! We are in the middle of a swell ! Get your ass back to the Ranger now ! Brand get back here now ! Cooper , go , Cooper go , I can 't make it . Go ! CASE , go get her . GO ! - Get up , get up Brand . Go go , go . I 'm not gonna make it ! - Yes you are . Yes you are ! Come on CASE has her , CASE has her ! Get back here Doyle ! Dr. Brand . To the hatch . Go , go . Go . Manually overriding inside hatch ! Cooper don 't ! Cooper don 't ! Cooper ! Engines are flooded ! I 'll have to shut it down ! Oh shit ! Whoaa ! CASE what 's wrong ? - Chute 's waterlogged , let it drain . Goddamn it ! I told you to leave me . - And I told you to get your ass back here ! The difference is that one of us was thinkin ' about the mission . - You were thinking about getting home ! I was trying to do the right thing ! - Can you tell that to Doyle ? CASE , how much time ? - 45 to an hour . The stuff of life huh ? What 's this gonna cost us Brand ? - A lot . Decades . What happened to Miller ? - Judging by the wreckage she was broken up by a wave soon after impact . How 's the hell the wreckage stayed together after all these years , huh ? Because of the time slippage . On this planet 's time she , she 's landed hours ago , she she probably just died minutes ago . The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly . Oh we are not prepared for this . You eggheads have the survival skills of a boy-scout troop . Well we got this far on our brains , farther than any human in history . Well not far enough . And now we 're stuck here till there won 't be anyone left on Earth to save . I 'm counting every minute same as you Cooper . Is there any possibility ? I dunno , maybe some way , I don 't know maybe if we could jump in a black hole and gain back the years ? Don 't shake your head at me ! Time is relative , okay . It can stretch and it can squeeze , but , it can 't run backwards ! Just can 't ! The only thing that can move across dimensions , like time , is gravity . Okay . The beings that led us here , they communicate through gravity , right ? Could they be talking to us from the future ? - Maybe . Okay , if they can .. ? They are beings of 5 dimensions ! Right , to them , time might be yet another physical dimension . To them , the past might be a canyon they can climb into , and the future , a mountain that they can climb up , but to us , it 's not ! Okay ! Look Cooper , I screwed up . I 'm sorry . But you knew about relativity . Brand . My daughter is 10 years old . Couldn 't teach her Einstein 's theories before I left , Couldn 't you have told your daughter that you were going to save the world ? - No . When you become a parent , one thing becomes really clear , And that 's you wanna make sure your children feel safe , and it rules out telling a 10 year old , that the world 's ending ' . Cooper . How long for the engines CASE ? - A minute or two . Well we don 't have it ! Helmets on ! Brand , co-pilot you 're up . CASE , run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters . We 're gonna spark it ! - Roger that . Depressurizing . Engines up ! Hello Rom ! - I 've waited years . How many , how many years ? By now it must be , 23 years , 4 months , 8 days . Doyle ? I thought I was prepared ... I knew the theory reality is different . And Miller ? There 's nothing here for us . Why didn 't you sleep ? - Oh I had a couple of stretches . I stopped believing that you were coming back . Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away . I learned what I could from the black hole but I couldn 't send anything to your father . We 've been receiving but nothing gets out . - Is he alive ? Oh , yeah . - Yeah ? - Yeah . We 've got years of messages stored . - Cooper . Messages span 23 years . Play from the beginning . Hey Dad , Just checkin ' in , sayin ' hi . Umm , finished 2nd in school , Miss Carlin 's still giving me Cs though , pulled me down , but second 's not bad . Grandpa attended the ceremony . Umm , oh , I met another girl dad . I uh , I really think this is the one . Her name is Lois . That 's her right there . Murphy stole grandpa 's car , She crashed it , she 's okay though . Hey Dad . Look at this ! You 're a grandpa ! His name 's Jesse . I wanted to go with Coop , but Lois says maybe next time . And Donald says he 's already got the ' great ' part so , we 're not to call him that . Say goodbye to Grandpa . Goodbye grandpa . Sorry , it 's been a while . It 's ... , what with Jesse and all ... Uhh , grandpa died last week . We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom and Jesse . Which is where we would 've buried you , if you would 've ever , ... come back . Murph was there at the funeral . We don 't see her that much , but she came for that . You 're not listening to this , I know . All these messages are just , ... drifting ... out there in the darkness . Lois says that , uh ... I have to let you go . And uh so ... I guess ... I 'll let you go . I don 't know where you 're dad . But I hope that you 're at peace . And ... Goodbye . Hey Dad . Hey Murph . - You son of a bitch ! I never made one of these when you were still responding , because I was so mad at you for leaving . And then when you went quiet , it felt like I should 've lived with that decision , and I have , but today is my birthday , And it 's a special one , because you told me , you once told me that when you come back we might be the same age . And today I 'm the age you were when you left . So it would be a real good time for you to come back ! I didn 't mean to intrude , It 's just that I 've never seen you in here before . - Because I 've never been in here before . I talk to Amelia , all the time . It helps . I 'm glad you 've started . - I haven 't . Just had something which needed to get out . - I know they 're still out there . I know . There are so many reasons why our communications might not be getting through . I know Professor . I 'm not sure , what I 'm more afraid of . Them never coming back or ... Then let 's succeed . - So , back to the fourth iteration . Let 's run it through some new fields . With respect Professor , we 've tried that hundreds of times . - It only has to work once , Murph . Every rivet that they strike could 've been a bullet . We 've done well , in the world here , whether or not we crack the equation , before I kick the bucket . Don 't be morbid Professor . - I 'm not afraid of death . I am an old physicist . I 'm afraid of time . Time . You 're afraid of time . For years we 've been trying to solve the equation without changing the underlying assumption about time . - And ? What it means , is each iteration is an attempt to prove it 's own proof , it 's recursive , ... it 's nonsensical . Are you calling my life 's work nonsense , Murph ? No , I 'm saying that you 've been trying to finish it with one arm no , with both arms tied behind your back . And I don 't understand why . I am an old man Murph . Can we take this point up at another time ? I want to talk to my daughter . Stepping out into the universe , we must confront the reality of interstellar travel . We must reach far beyond our own lifespans . We must think , not as individuals , but as a species . 'Do not go gentle into that good night . ' TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her but the trip took years longer than what we anticipated . We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects , so , we 've got to choose . But how ? They 're both promising . And Edmunds data is better , but Dr. Mann is the one who 's still transmitting . So ... We 've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would 've soured . His world has key elements to sustain human life . - As does Dr. Mann 's . Cooper , this is my field . And I really believe Edmund 's is the better prospect . - Why ? Gargantua , that 's why . Look at Miller 's planet . Hydrocarbons , organics , yes ; But no life . Sterile . We 'll find the same thing on Mann 's . - Because of the black hole ? - Murphy 's Law . Whatever can happen , will happen . Accidents are the first building block of evolution , but when you 're orbiting a black hole , not enough can happen , it sucks in asteroids , comets , other events which would otherwise reach you . We need to go further afield . You once said that Dr. Mann , was the best of us . He is remarkable . we 're only here because of him . And , and yet here he is , he is on the ground , and he 's sending a very unambiguous message , telling us to come to his planet . - Granted . But Edmund 's data is more promising . - We should vote . - Well , if we 're going to vote , there 's something you should know , Brand , he has a right to know . That has nothing to do with it . - What does ? She 's in love with Wolf Edmunds . - Is that true ? Yes . And that makes me want to follow my heart . Maybe we 've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory , - You 're a scientist Brand . - So listen to me , When I say that love isn 't something we invented , it 's observable , powerful . It has to mean something . - Love has meaning , yes , social utility social bonding , child rearing , - We love people who have died , where 's the social utility in that ? - None . - Maybe it means something more , something we can 't yet understand . Maybe it 's , some evidence , some artifact of a higher dimension ... that we can 't consciously perceive , I 'm drawn across the universe to someone I haven 't seen in a decade . Who , I know , is probably dead . Love is the one thing we 're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space . Maybe we should trust that , even if we can 't understand it yet . Alright Cooper , Yes ! The tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me . But that doesn 't mean I 'm wrong . - Honestly Amelia , it might . TARS , chart a course for Dr. Mann 's . We 'll lose about a third again . Next year . Next year , I 'm gonna work Nelson 's farm and I 'm gonna make it up . What happened to Nelson ? Murph , can I get you anything ? Would you like some more Soufflé ? - No , I 'm full . Thanks . It was delicious . Hand me that donut please . Will you spend the night ? Your room is exactly as you left it . It 's ... - I need to get back . - My sewing machine is in there , but there 's plenty ... - I need to too many memories . - Well , we have something for that . Dust . Lois , I have a friend who could look at his lungs . Amelia , I 'm sorry . - You 're just being objective . Unless you 're punishing me , for screwing up on Miller 's planet , - No , this wasn 't a personal decision . Well , if you 're wrong , you have a very personal decision to make . Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey . Strike out on Mann 's planet and you 'll have to decide whether to return home , or push onto Edmunds with plan B. Starting a colony could save us from extinction . You might have to decide between seeing your children again or the future of the human race . I trust you 'll be as objective then . He has been asking for you since he came to . We were trying to reach you . Murph ? - Hey . I 'm here Professor . I think I let all down . No , you got us this far . We 're close . I will finish what you started . Good , good Murph . You had faith . All those , all those years , I asked you to have faith , I wanted you to believe , that your father , ... would come back . I do Professor . Forgive me Murph . - There 's nothing to forgive . I lied Murph , I lied to you . There was no need for him , to come back . There 's no way to help us . But the Plan A ? All this ? All these people . And the equation ? Did my father know ? Did he leave me ? 'Do ... . not ... . go ... . gentle ... . ' No . NO ! You can 't leave . NO ! Dr. Brand , I 'm sorry to tell you that your father died today . He didn 't feel any pain . He was at peace . I 'm very sorry for your loss . Brand did you know ? He told you right ? You knew ? This was all a sham . You left us here . To suffocate . To starve . Frozen cloud . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Pray you never learn , just how good it can be to see another face . I hadn 't had a lot of hope to begin with . After so long I had none . My supplies were completely exhausted . The last time I went to sleep , I didn 't even set up a waking date . You 've literally raised me from the dead . Lazarus . What about the others ? - I 'm afraid you 're it sir . So far , surely . No . In our present situation there 's very little chance of rescuing any others . Dr. Mann . Dr. Mann , tell us about your world . Our world , we hope ... Our world is cold , stark , but undeniably beautiful . The days are 67 hours long , cold . The nights are 67 far colder hours . The gravity is a very , very pleasant 80 % of the Earth 's . Now here , where I landed , the water is alkali . And the air has too much ammonia in it to breathe for more than just a few minutes . But , down at the surface , and there is , a surface , the chlorine dissipates , the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons . Breathable air , to organics . Possibly even , to life . We might be sharing this world . These readings are from the surface ? Over the years , I 've dropped various probes . - How far have you explored ? I have managed several major expeditions , but with oxygen in limited supply , KIPP there , really did most of the legwork . - What went wrong with him sir ? Degeneration . He misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals . We struggled on for a time , but ultimately I decommissioned him , used his power source to keep the mission going . I thought I was alone before I even shut him down . - Would you like me to take a look at him ? No , no , needs a human touch . Dr. Brand , CASE is relaying a message for you , from the spaceship . - Okay , be right there . Excuse me . Dr. Brand , I 'm sorry to tell you that your father died today . He had no pain . He was at peace . I 'm sorry for your loss . Is that Murph ? - She 's , ... she 's grown ! Brand did you know ? He told you right ? You knew ? This was all a sham . You left us here . To suffocate . To starve . Did my father know too ? Dad ! I just want to know , if you left me here to die ? I just have to know ! Cooper , my father dedicated his whole life to plan A , I have no idea what she 's talking about . I do . He , he never even hoped to get the people off the Earth ? No . But he has been trying to solve the gravity equation for 40 years . Amelia , your father solved his equation before I even left . Then why wouldn 't he use it ? The equation couldn 't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics You need more . More ? More what ? - More data . You need to see into a black hole . The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity . - Romilly , is that true ? If the black hole is an oyster , then the singularity is the pearl inside . The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden in darkness , beyond the horizon . That 's why we call it a ' black ' hole . Okay , ... what if we see beyond the horizon ? We can 't Cooper . - There are some things that aren 't meant to be known . Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction . Plan B , a colony . - But why not tell people ? Why keep it from us ? Because he knew how hard it would be to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves . Or their children . Bullshit ! You never would have come here unless you believed you were gonna save them . Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier . We can care deeply , selflessly about those we know . But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight . - But the lie ? That monstrous lie ? - Unforgivable . And he knew that . He was prepared to destroy his own humanity , in order to save the species , he made an incredible sacrifice . NO ! No , an incredible sacrifice is being made , by the people on Earth who 're gonna die ! Because in his fucking arrogance , he declared their case hopeless . I 'm sorry Cooper , their case is hopeless . No . No . - We are the future . Cooper . Cooper , what I can do ? Let me go home . You 're absolutely positive ? His solution was correct . He 's had it for years . - It 's worthless ? It 's half the answer . Okay , how do you find the other half ? Out there , in a black hole . But stuck down on Earth ? Yeah ? I 'm not sure you can . God , they just pack up and leave . What 're they hoping to find ? - Survival . Damn it ! Murph , don 't , don 't people have the right to know ? Panic won 't help . We just have to keep working , same as ever . Yes , but isn 't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating ... - Brand gave up on us . I 'm still trying to solve this . So , do you have an idea ? A feeling . I told you about my ghost . My dad thought I called it a ghost because I was scared of it . But I was never scared of it . I called it a ghost because it felt ... . like a person , that was trying to tell me something . If there is an answer here on Earth , it 's back there , somehow in that room . So I have to find it . We 're running out of time . What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers ? They can stay CASE . I 'll be sleeping most of the way anyway . - Hey Coop . - Yeah ? I had a suggestion for your return journey . - What is that ? Have one last crack at the black hole . I 'm going home Rom . - Yeah I know . This isn 't gonna cost you any time . It 's a chance for the people on Earth . Talk to me . - Gargantua is an older spinning black hole . It is what we call a ' gentle ' singularity . - Gentle ? They 're hardly gentle . But the tidal gravity is so quick that something crossing the horizon fast , might survive . A probe say . What happens after it crosses ? After , the horizon , is a complete mystery . So , what 's to say that there isn 't some way that the probe can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data ? If he 's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse ... Just when did this probe become a ' he ' professor ? - TARS is the obvious candidate . I 've already told him what to look for . I 'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP , Cooper . - You would do this for us ? Before you get all teary , try to remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say . - Your cue light 's blinking . I 'm not joking ! I 'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP . Well , I don 't wanna disturb his archival functions . - I 'll supervise . Alright . - Dr . Mann , we need to find 3 secure sites . One for Brand 's lab and 2 for habitat . Once those modules have landed , you don 't wanna move . Well I can take you to the probes sites , but I don 't think this these conditions are gonna hold . I think we should wait . CASE is headed back down with the rest of the distillery equipment . I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall . Well , these squalls do usually blow over . Okay then . - You 're gonna have to take a long-range transmitter . Right . - Are you charged ? - Yeah . Follow me . TARS , 72 hours yeah ? - Roger that Cooper . Brand told me why you feel you 've got to go back . But I 'd be remiss if didn 't at least mention that a mission such as ours could certainly do with an extra engineer . Oh you better slow down turbo . Safety first CASE , do not forget . - Safety first Cooper . I have to tell you Dr. Mann I 'm honored to be a part of this . But once we set up base camp and secure those modules , my work is done here . I 'm going home . We have attachments . But even without a family , I can , promise you that , that yearning to be with other people is remarkable . That emotion is , at the foundation , of what makes us human . How long have you had that cough ? - For a while . Mom let 's me play in here . I don 't touch your stuff . Just take this gently . You know why we couldn 't just send machines on these missions , don 't you Cooper ? A machine doesn 't improvise well , because you can 't programme the fear of death . Our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration . Take you for example , A father , with a survival instinct that extends to your kids . What does research tell us , is the last thing you 're gonna see , before you die ? Your children . Their faces . At the moment of death , your mind is going to push you a little bit harder , to survive . For them . Hey , I bet you 're Coop . Why don 't you have a seat here for me . It 's bad . They cannot stay here . OK ? - Yes . TARS , what 's taking so long ? - Professor , I 'm having trouble completing the boot-up . I don 't understand ? It 's funny . When I left Earth , I thought I was prepared to die . The truth is , I never really , considered the possibility that my planet wasn 't the one . Nothing turns out the way it 's supposed to be . - Let 's go . Aaaaaaaaaaaah ! What is this ? - What are you doing ? I 'm sorry , I can 't let you leave with that ship . We 're going to need it to complete the mission . Once the others , realize what this place isn 't . We cannot survive here . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . They can 't stay here anymore . You have to leave , right now . Hey buddy , let me make something abundantly clear ... You have a responsibility . - Shit . Coop , get her stuff , she 's goin ' home . - Dad didn 't raise you to be this dumb Tom ! Dad didn 't raise me , grandpa did , and he 's buried out back with mom and Jesse . All the data ? No . I tried to do my duty Cooper . But I knew , the day that I arrived here , this place had nothing and I resisted the temptation , for years But , I knew that , if I just pressed that button , then , somebody would come and save me . You fucking coward ! - Yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . Listen , if you 're not gonna go , let your family go . Just let , ... save your family . And go to live underground ? With you ? Pray that daddy comes to save us ? Dad 's not coming back . He never was coming back . It 's upto me ! Are you going to save everybody ? Because dad couldn 't do it ? . - DAD DIDN 'T EVEN TRY ! Dad just abandoned us ! He left us here to die . - Nobody is going with you . You 're gonna wait for your next kid to die ? Get out , and don 't come back ! Do what you want with those things . Stop it ! No . NO ! Dr. Mann there 's a 50-50 chance that you 're gonna kill yourselves . Those are the best odds I 've had in years ! Don 't judge me Cooper . You were never tested like I was . Few men have been . You tried your best Murph . Do you feel it ? The survival instinct . That 's what drove me . It 's what drives all of us , and it 's what 's gonna save us . Because I want to save all of us . For you Cooper . I 'm sorry , I can 't , I can 't watch you go through this . I 'm sorry . I thought I could , but I can 't . I 'm here , I 'm here for you . Just listen to my voice Cooper , I 'm right here . You 're not alone . Do you see your children ? It 's okay . They are right there with you . Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left ? Do you remember ? 'Do not go gentle , into that good night 'Old age should burn , and rave at close of day . ' 'Rage , rage against the dying of the light . ' Help ! Help ! - Cooper ? CASE ! - Brand . No air ! Cooper . Cooper I 'm coming . CASE ! - I have a fix . Go , go , go ! Cooper we 're coming , hang in there , don 't talk ! Breathe as little as possible . We 're almost there ! There is a security lockout sir , it requires a person to access the functions . It 's all yours sir . Cooper ! Come on ! I see him ! I see him ! To the right . Bank right ! Cooper ! Cooper , I 'm here . Take this ! Joey bring the tankers ! This data makes no sense . I 'm sorry . - What ? Mann , was lying ! Romilly ! Romilly , do you read me ? Romilly ! STEP BACK PROFESSOR ! STEP BACK ! Romilly . - Romilly ! Do you read me ? ! Keep watch ! Lois ! - What happened to caution CASE ? Safety first Cooper . Romilly , Romilly do you read me ? This is Brand . Romilly ! - Dr . Brand , Cooper , there 's been an explosion . Dr. Mann 's compound . TARS , TARS ! 10 o 'clock . Tell me when TARS is aboard . Romilly did not survive . I could not save him . - TARS is in . - I 'll take it from here ! D 'you have a fix on the Ranger ? - He is pushing into orbit . Ah , if he takes control of that ship we 're dead . He 'd maroon us ? - He is marooning us ! Get downstairs . Go wait by the car . Come on . Get in the back ! Get in the back seat , now ! Dr. Mann please respond ! Dr. Mann please respond ! He doesn 't know the Endurance 's docking procedure . - But the autopilot does . Not since TARS disabled it ! - Nice ! What is your trust setting TARS ? - Lower than yours apparently ! Do not attempt docking , I repeat do not attempt docking . Auto docking sequence withheld . Override . - Unauthorized . - Override ! Unauthorized . Do not attempt docking , I repeat Do Not ! attempt docking ! Please resp ... Moving slowly towards the Endurance . Imperfect contact . - Override ! - Hatch locked . Has he locked on yet ? - Imperfectly . Dr. Mann ... Hatch lockout disengaged . Dr. Mann , do not , I repeat , do not open the hatch . I repeat , do not open the hatch . If you open the hatch , the airlock will depressurize . What happens if he blows the airlock ? - Nothing good . Okay , pull back , pull back . Retro thrusters full move back CASE ! - Maximum . - Back ! CASE relay my message to the onboard computer and have it rebroadcast as emergency PA . Dr. Mann , do not open the air hatch . I repeat , do not ... - Brand ? I don 't know what he said to you ? But I 'm taking command of the Endurance . And then we 're gonna talk about completing the mission . Dr. Mann , listen to me ! This is not about my life , or Cooper 's life , This is about all mankind . There is a moment ... It is not ... Oh , my God . Cooper there 's no point in using your fuel ... - Analyze the Endurance 's spin . - Cooper , what are you doing ? - Docking . Computer says rotation at 67 , 68 rpm . Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters . - It 's not possible . - No , it 's necessary . The Endurance is entering the atmosphere . It does not have a heat shield . CASE , you ready ? - Ready . Cooper , this is no time for caution . CASE , if I pass out , you take the stick . TARS , get ready to engage the docking mechanism . The Endurance is starting to heat . - 20 feet out . I need three degrees starboard Cooper . - 10 feet out . Cooper , we are , lined up ! Initiate spin ! Hold on TARS ! HOLD ON ! We 're locked Cooper . - EASING UP ! Slowly . Slowly . Retro thrusters ! Main engines on ! We 're getting out of orbit . Come on baby ! Shutting engines . Okay we 're out of orbit ! Okay ! And for our next trick ! It better be good . We 're headed into Gargantua 's pull . Shit . CASE take the stick . - Roger that . Cooper , we 're slipping towards Gargantua . Shall I use the engines ? No , we gotta let her slide as far as we can ! Give it to me . - It 's good news and bad news Cooper . Yeah , to hell with it TARS ! Just give it to me straight . The back-up generator kicked in , so the system 's stable . They 're all good . Good ! Okay . The navigational hub 's been completely destroyed . We don 't have enough life support to make it back to Earth , but I think we can scratch over to Edmund 's planet . - What about fuel ? It 's not enough . But I have a plan . We let , Gargantua , pull us down close ... to the horizon , and a powered slingshot around launching us towards Edmund 's planet . - Manually ? That 's what I 'm here for . I 'll take us just inside the critical orbit . What about the time slippage ? Neither one of us have time to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand . Sorry Cooper . Once we have gathered enough speed around Gargantua , we use Lander 1 , and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to push us out of the black hole 's gravity The Lander 's linkages have been destroyed , so we 're going to have to control it manually . Once Lander 1 is spent , TARS will detach and get sucked right into that black hole ! - Why does TARS have to detach ? We have to shed the weight , escape gravity . - Newton 's third law . The only way humans have figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind . Cooper , you can 't ask TARS to do this for us . - He 's a robot so you don 't have to ask him to do anything . - Cooper , you asshole ! Sorry , you broke up a little bit there . - It 's what we intended Dr. Brand . It 's our only chance to save people on Earth , if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I 'll find in there , maybe they 'll make it . Let 's just hope there is still someone there to save . Maximum velocity achieved . Prepare to fire speed thrusters . Ready ? - Ready . - Ready . Main engine ignition in 3 , 2 , 1 ... Engines of Lander 1 on my command , 3 , 2 , 1 ... Engines of Ranger 2 on my command , 3 , 2 , 1 ... This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years ! You 're not too bad for someone pushing 120 ! Lander 1 , prepare to detach on my mark , 3 , 2 , 1 ... Detach ! Goodbye TARS ! - Goodbye Dr. Brand . See you on the other side Coop . See you there slick ! Okay CASE . Nice reckless flying ! Learned from the master ! Ranger 2 , prepare for detachment . - What , no , no ! Cooper , Cooper , what are you doing ? Newton 's third law . You gotta leave something behind ! You said we had enough resources for both of us ! - We agreed Amelia , 90 % No ! Detach . Okay , we 're nosing down . Approaching the event horizon . Portside , dipping down beneath it ... , to go through it . Heading towards ... blackness ... I have a visual of the event ! It 's all black ! TARS , do you read me ? It 's all black . TARS , do you read me ? Over . We 're ... we 're getting screens , We 're getting interference . Losing control of the stick . We 've got flashes . Flashes of lightness and blackness . There 's a turbulence in the gravity . Computers going down . The gravitational pull , we 're losing control of the stick . Murph ! Murph , come on ! Murph ! Murph ! Murph ! Murphhh ! Murph ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no . Murphhhhhhhhh ! Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! No , no ! If you 're leaving just go ! - No . No , don 't go . Don 't go you idiot ! Don 't go ! Morse , Morse , Morse . 'S' 'T' 'A' '-' '-' Murph , we don 't have time for this , come on ! STAY ! Come on , come on , Murph , Murph , come on ! What 's it say ? What 's it say ? What 's it say ? It say 's STAY ! Tell him Murph . Make him stay . Make him , make him stay Murph . STAY Make him stay Murph ! Don 't let me leave Murph ! Don 't , DON 'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH ! NO , NO , NO , NOOO ! . It was you ! You were my ghost ! Cooper , Cooper come in . - TARS ? Roger that . You survived ? - Somewhere in their fifth dimension . They saved us ! Yeah ? Well who the hell is ' They ' ? And just why would they want to help us ? I don 't know , but they constructed this three-dimensional space inside their five dimensional reality to allow you to understand it . - Yeah well it ain 't working . Yes it is . You 've seen that time , is represented as a physical dimension . You 've worked out that you can exert a force across spacetime . - Gravity to send a message ? - Affirmative . Gravity can cross the dimensions , including time ? - Apparently . Do you have the quantum data ? - Roger , I have it . I 've translated it on all wavelengths but nothing is getting out Cooper . - I can do this , I can . But such complicated data to a child ? - Not just any child . Come on dad ! Murph , the fire 's out ! Come on ! Even though you communicate it here , she won 't understand it 's significance for years ! No , no , I get that TARS , but we 've got to figure something out alright or the people on Earth are gonna die ! Think , think , think ! Cooper , they didn 't bring us here to change the past . Say that again . - They didn 't bring us here , to change the past . No , they didn 't bring us here at all . We brought ourselves ! TARS , give me the coordinates for NASA , in binary . In binary , roger , translating data . It 's not a ghost . It 's gravity . - Don 't you get it yet TARS ? I brought myself here ! We 're here to communicate , with the three dimensional world ! We are the bridge ! I thought they chose me . But they didn 't choose me , they chose her ! - For what Cooper ? To save the world ! All of this ! In one , little girl 's bedroom . Every moment , it 's infinitely complex . They have access to infinite time and space but they 're not bound by anything ! They can 't find , a specific place in time . They can 't communicate . That 's why I 'm here . - I 'm here to find a way to tell Murph , just like I found this moment . - How Cooper ? Love TARS , love ! It 's just like Brand said , my connection with Murph , it is quantifiable . It is the key . - Why are we here ? To find out how to tell . The watch ! The watch ! Encode the data in the movement of the second hand . TARS , translate the data into Morse and give it to me . Translating the data to Morse . Cooper , what if she never came back for it ? She will . She will . He 's coming Murph ! Okay , coming down ! - How do you know ? Because I gave it to her ! Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot , Dot , dot , dash , dot , dot , dash , dot , dot , dot , dash , dot , dot , It was him ! All the time ! I knew it ! Dad saved us ! Eureka ! It 's traditional . Eureka ! Did it work ? - I think it might have . How do you know ? Because , the bulk beings are closing the Tesseract . Don 't you get it yet TARS ? They 're not beings . They 're us ! What I 've been doing for Murph , they 've been doing for me ! For all of us . - Cooper , people couldn 't build this . No , no . Not yet . But one day . Not you and me . But people . A civilization that 's evolved past the 4 dimensions that we know . What happens now ? Mr. Cooper . Let 's take it slow sir . Nice and easy Mr. Cooper . Remember you 're no spring chicken anymore . Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old . Take it slow sir . You were , um , extremely lucky . The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply . Where am I ? Cooper station . Currently orbiting Saturn . Cooper station ? What nice of you to name it after me ! What ? - Well , the station isn 't named after you sir , It 's uh , it 's named after your daughter . Although she 's always maintained just how important you were . - Is she still alive ? She 'll be here in a couple of weeks . She is far too old to be transferred from another station but when she heard that you 'd been found . Well this is , this is Murphy Cooper we 're talking about ! Yes it is ! We 'll have you checked out of here in a couple of days . I 'm sure you 'll be excited to see what 's in store . I actually uhh , did a paper on you , in high school , I know all about your life back on Earth . Oh yeah , right . Sir , if you could follow me ? You 've got a really good situation . So um , when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper , I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect . Well of course , I didn 't speak to her in person . My dad was a farmer . Like everybody else back then . Anyway , there just wasn 't enough food . We had strips of sheet to cover our nose and mouth . So we wouldn 't breathe so much of it . She did confirm , just how much you loved farming . She did ? Did she ? Well , home sweet home ! Everything is in its place and faithfully reproduced . Yes . Hey , is this ? - Oh yeah , the machine we found out near Saturn with you . It 's power source is shot , but we can get another one if you want . Yes , please ! Settings . General settings . Security settings . Honesty , new setting . 95 % Confirmed . Additional customization ? Humor : 75 % Confirmed . Auto self destruct T minus 10 , 9 ... Let 's make that 60 % . 60 % confirmed . Knock Knock . - You want 55 ? Is this really what it was like ? It was never this clean slick . I don 't care much for this , pretending we are back where we started . I want to know where we are ? Where are we going ? Mr Cooper . - Yes ? - The family is all in there . Family ? Yeah , they all came out to see her . She 's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years . You told them I liked farming ? It was me Murph ! I was your ghost ! I know . People didn 't believe me , they thought I was doing it all myself . But I knew who it was . Nobody believed me . But I knew you 'd come back . How ? Because my dad promised me ! I 'm here now Murph . I 'm here ! No . No parent should have to watch their own child die . I have my kids here for me now . You go ! Where ? Brand . She 's , out there . Setting up camp . Alone , in a strange galaxy . Maybe right now she 's , settling in for the long nap . By the light of our new sun . In our new home .

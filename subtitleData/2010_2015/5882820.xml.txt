 - Okay , I 'm rolling . - My name is Holly King . I am a psychology student at the University of Oregon . In 2008 I saw a news report about 30 elite scientists that had gotten together in a remote area of the Ural Mountains in Russia . They were trying to solve a mystery that had baffled the world for almost 50 years . It had become known as " The Dyatlov Pass Incident " after a leader of the expedition there in 1959 , named Igor Dyatlov . They failed , but I was riveted by the story . So when my favorite professor , Dr. Kittles , assigned the class a project on that very same incident , I couldn 't believe it . I mentioned it to a buddy of mine , Jensen , a film student here , and he said that we should make a film . So , we applied for grant , and ... We got it ... ! Okay , so ... tell us what happened . I first heard about the incident when a Russian journalist named Yuri Yarovoi , published a fictionalized account of it in a book . Of course , they had him killed . And it didn 't matter that he fictionalized it . They didn 't want anybody talking about Dyatlov . And I began using the facts of the incident as a teaching exercise in psychology because there is so much that we know about what happened at Dyatlov Pass , so many details ... and yet , the whole thing remains shrouded in mystery . What are some of the explanations that you tend to get ? The most common cold scientific explanation I get is a condition called hypothermic dementia ... Hypothermic dementia . Yeah , that is literally what everybody says . But my favorite is ... " paradoxical undressing " . That does actually happen . All these people suffering with severe hypothermia . They get disoriented , think that they are overheating and then start taking off their clothes . Come on Holly ! These were nine experienced backpackers . Yeah . You telling me that they all got severe hypothermia ... - at the same time , on the same night ? - Mm hm . They had been out for three days already . Why then ? An avalanche is another frequent answer . That is even stupider ... - than " paradoxical undressing " . - Why ? If they could hear an avalanche , then why did they stay away from the camp for 3 hours with no shoes ? But in truth , there are innumerable answers to the question , most of my students would project their own fears onto it . The Russian military ? I really expect my students to do more than come up with a believable explanation . I want them to put themselves in the place of those people , so that they can try to understand why the victims did what they did . That is the answer I 'm looking for . We 're going to find out the truth . - Even though they 'll never find it . - What do you mean ? There is no truth . The first leg of our journey will take us from Eugene , Oregon to Chelyabinsk , Russia . You 're not going to use that stupid dotted red line thing to show us travelling , right ? Wrong ! Our ultimate destination is the Kholat Syakhl , literally translated " The Mountain of the Dead " . Seriously . A name the Mansi tribe gave it due to many accounts of mysterious deaths and disappearances throughout history . So ... we found ourselves an audio engineer , Denise Evers . She was the only audio person on campus that could handle the physical requirements . Why are there skinny dudes in audio ? Hey ! What 's wrong with skinny dudes ? Oh , sorry ! My bad . And then we found two capable guides . I 'm Andy Thatcher , president of the Northwest Trail Association . I 've climbed just about every mountain worth climbing in the U.S. , I 've also hiked the AT . - Sorry , the what ? - The Appalachian Trail . It runs from Maine to Georgia , it took me all summer . - So you think that you can handle this ? - Yeah . Okay . What makes you want to do this , Andy ? Oh , like I said , I 've climbed pretty much just about everything worth climbing in the U.S. , it 's time for a new challenge . - Are you scared ? - No . Really , it 's just that , you know , we 're recreating a trip in which 9 people died . Yeah , what like 50 years ago ? Come on even if it was the Abominable Snowman ... - Yeti ! - He is dead and is gone by now . - And you are ... ? - He is JP Hauser . - JP . - Got it . And you think that you 're ready for this ? Friend , explain you 're hiking in them later , he 's ready . - Really ? - Yeah . - I took a little time off . - A lot of time off . " Hauser " like " Hauser Hall " ? Like the building that we 're in front of , right now . - That 's the one . - Cool . That reminds me , I got to get to Philosophy . I 'll catch you kids later . Now that we had our crew it was time to get busy . We studied the maps , and secured our gear , we gathered our rations and supplies ... and then we trained in the local mountains . We were all getting excited and eager to go . - I hate these freaking snowshoes . - But you look so cool in them , Jensen . Hey ! Stay together . You 're getting the hang of it ! Almost as much as I hate him . Shit ! And now , it 's January 25 ... Time to go . The search continues today for five Oregon University students who disappeared last month in the Ural Mountains . You may recall that 3 days ago rescue workers uncovered items that apparently belonged to the students , including tents , backpacks and other equipment . Our Russian correspondent , Ivan Kudryavtsev , with Russian news channel 24 , has more . Thank you , Ivan . The students were recreating the ill-fated journey undertaken by Igor Dyatlov and 8 other Russian hikers 50 years ago for a documentary . The most promising lead recovered was the students ' recording equipment . Experts reviewed the footage without releasing it to the public , but today , a group of hackers calling themselves Conspira-Leaks gained access to the footage and posted it on their website . I opened the door and the darkness followed me , just like in my dream . Hey , come on . Hey , hey , hey . - It was a dream , just a dream ... - I 'm sorry . Jensen , is not going to get us out of here ! I 'm sorry ... So we 've landed in Russia and the next leg of our journey takes us from Chelyabinsk into the Ural Mountains to a town called Ivdel . Nice tattoo , angel . Got matching wing , or just one ? - Just the one , and it hurt like hell . - Yeah , I bet . Any others we should know about ? Maybe something you want to show the camera ? In your dreams , perv . Now tell us about that phone . Phone ? Oh yeah . It 's equipped with a GPS , reversal GPS , that is . And when there 's no cell signal , the GPS down here can navigate for us anywhere in the world . Cool ! Can I borrow it , can you give it out ... ? You know I didn 't bring any fluid ? - You mean like this ? - Hey , you talking to your camera ? I 'm talking to Lucille . You talk to her like she 's a girl ? Some guys get very attached to their cameras . Don 't listen to ' em , baby , they 're just jealous . - Thank you . - Very attached ... Thank you . Can I see that ? So what is it about all guys , that makes you guys think , I just want to strap on a backpack and spend a week out there ? It 's a test , you know ? Man against the elements . People survived for thousands of years without any of these kinds of stuff . So rather than you need to do without , you bet your ass I do . You 're awfully confident . Well , you got in all that , anything less than confident , you 're not coming back . Okay . What about you , JP ? I just figure we only get one go out of it , you know ? I want to try to do and see as much as possible . I 've got everything I need in that pack to survive for months ... - That pack ? - Years maybe . Yeah , that pack . How many people could say that ? Well , but we don 't need to survive for that long . - Well , you never know . - You never know . We 're spending one night in Ivdel , so we can interview a man named Peter Karov . He was actually the tenth member of the Dyatlov group but got sick on the first day out and had to turn back . Not long after , he had some kind of breakdown and he has been in this psychiatric hospital here ever since . You are too much ! Hey , hey . Don 't touch the camera ! Turn it off ! No recording ! I just want to get you saying that on camera ! You must go now , please ! Come on Ivan . The Cold War 's over , we 're friends now . - Why can 't we interview Peter Karov ? - He 's dead . - What ? - Now go . - How did he die ? - Go ! - Sure friendly , huh ? - Yeah . Hey Holly , top window ! What ? Is that him ? - I don 't understand ! - Oh ! Did you see that ? Was that for us ? What did it say ? - You guys saw that , right ? - Yeah , what the hell ... ? I know I 'm starting to sound like Jensen , but I believe that was Peter Karov we saw in that window . And I really want to know what was on that note he showed us . But since we can 't see him , and trains don 't run here , we 're trying to find a ride to a town called Vizhaj , where we 'll begin our hike . You know , I 'm not sure we should have sent Jensen as American emissary . That guy could restart the Cold War . Okay , so these guys say that there is a local bar down this way that we should check out , because a couple of the locals might have family in Vizhaj . So we might be able to hitch a ride . Sounds good ? - Let 's go . - A bar sounds good to me . Aw , that 's the wrong way , man ! I did not ! This is the way he said we should go ! That 's what I 'm talking about ! Jensen 1 Andy 0 . Oh look at that , you can 't take your dogs inside . Looks like you 're going home alone . - I 'm sorry . - Calm down ! Hey Holly , you know why there 's no drunk driving in Russia ? - No . - Ta - da ! Hey ! Hey ! Let 's just take a picture ! Come on ! - Yeah ! - Yeah , I got a timer on my camera . Only if we can do stuff on the iPhone 3 . Let 's go . Okay . - One .. - Cheese . - Two ... Three ... - West Coast ! Do you speak English ? Of course . - Something to drink ? - Yes , please . Jensen , we 're looking for a ride here . We are young attractive people in a foreign land and we would like to drink . - Where you are going ? - Vizhaj . Now , about that drink ? Vizhaj ? What for ? We 're making a documentary about the Dyatlov Pass Incident . Oh ... Then you must try this ! - What is that ? - VIP , gentlemen . - Oh , come at me shot ! - It 's scuzzy with me . Oh shut up . You 're with me , so you get the special treatment . Can I get a cigarette of mine ? Yeah ! I think there 's plenty around . - Ah ... the unmarked Bottle of Doom . - Thirsty bottle . - Oh my God , do you smell that ? - Yeah ! - Oh God ! No ! - It stinks . - Maybe not so full ... - Fill it up ! That is big ! Let 's do it ! Okay . - Shall I pass them around ? - Wait , wait wait ! - Hello ? - He got more . Oh God , it 's gonna be messy . - It 's call is always ... - Might be a mess here with me , bitch . Can you please ... ? Gentlemen , come have your shot ! Here 's to success of your trip . - Thank you . - " Na zdorovje " What ? Well , I may not know anything about the people , or the culture , or the history or the women of Russia , but I did my homework on good manners . - So ... alright ! - Cheers , you guys ! Oh , that 's some serious shit ! What are you guys ? Pussies ? What is that ? - Sa - ma- gon . - Samagon . Ah it 's some ... it 's like Russian moonshine . Yes ? Why serve us Samagon ? Ah , they came to try here ... - Before they left . - Who ? Who out of here ? Dyatlov ! They drank this before they left . Stop it . It 's not funny . - It 's not a bad omen at all , right ? - No , it 's just a coincidence . I believe we will take one more round , my friend . - Yeah . - Rack ' em up ! - You 're making movie ? - That 's right . - And going to Vizhaj , yes ? - Yeah . Yeah , do you know how we can get there ? I will take you . Oh ! You will ? Okay . We leave tomorrow . Yes , that 's great . Can you take all of us ? No problem . I told you man , it 'll work out . Okay , can we get ... this guy a drink ? - Okay drink . - Vodka . Thank you very much . No problem . I am Sergei . See ? This isn 't so bad . Who put Jensen in charge of transportation ? At least we got the ladies , bro . - Keep dreaming . - How far is it ? This Vizhaj ? About forty miles . Forty ? Great . At least we have enough potatoes to choke donkey . - Come on Denise , let 's go ! - Guys ! My eyelids are frozen shut . It 's not funny . What do I do ? - Here , hold still . - Go easy on her , Andy . - Hold on . - Ouch . Hold on , hold on ! There you are . There you go , girl . - Yeah , thanks . - You okay ? It 's cold out here ? I suppose you got the ... - Yeah , it feels kind of cold . - Alright , let 's just go ! No , man ! That 's not cool . I 'll give you 1000 bucks if you lick that bumper . I 'll give you a dollar if you blow JP . Come on , guys ! Hey , you 're going to love this . Turns out that Sergei is here to visit his aunt . How exciting ! No . She says that she was part of the first rescue team at the scene at Dyatlov . - Wait , really ? - Yes . I can ask if she 'll speak to you , if you want . - Yes , yes I want , I want . - I 'll be in movie , right ? - You bet ! - She speak English ? Better than me . Can you translate something for me ? - Here , take the camera . - Yeah , sure . Let 's get inside and meet her there . - What 's her name ? - Alya . She was a school teacher . What is it ? The note that Igor held up . - Like this ? - Yeah , I think so . What does it mean ? " Stay away ! " Tell us what happened . My brother , Vallik , Sergei 's father , found the first body . I still remember how he was screaming when he turned her over . Go on . It didn 't take long time to find the others . A trail ... A trail of bodies ... They found two ... and a woman ... led to the tree where they had built a fire . There we found two and four more in the ravine . We were so sad , but not surprised . Then we found nobody had survived . But the scene was so strange . I felt ... them people getting nervous . I felt it too . Something was wrong with that place . I walked away , just wanted to get away from it . That 's when I found two others , on the north side . There was something wrong with them , more wrong than the others . And something ... in the snow near them . A machine ! - So strange ... - Sorry . Let 's ... Let 's cut a minute . So , you found 11 bodies . - Yes . - You 're sure ? I know what I saw , young lady . I will never forget . It 's just ... the report , the photos of the scene ... Everything says that there were only nine . The report ? You believe what everyone tells you to believe ... or you believe your own eyes ? I will drop you a trail here . We really can 't thank you enough , Sergei . - I told you ! - What did you tell me ? Aliens ! What else could this be ? What about the military ? You said yourself they were conducting experiments back then . Well , I 'm changing my vote to " aliens " now . Yeah , that makes way more sense , Jensen . How about it , Andy ? What do you think of Jensen 's alien theory ? - Stupid . - Hmm . He 's the strong silent type , huh ? I don 't think Andy agrees with your theory . Whatever ! Do you think you enough footage of me ? Get some of the mountains . But you 're so much more interesting , JP . Hey Andy ! Denise cannot take her eyes off you . Yeah , I get that a lot . Oh , Jesus ! What an asshole ! So guys . Is it everything that you hoped ? - Yeah . - Oh , yeah ! JP ! Any last words ? Is that it ? - Is that what ? - The " Kholat Syakhl " . Yeah . The Mountain of the Dead ! Jesus ! As you can see , the weather changes quickly , and it had . My snowshoe again ! A piece of shit ! - I would not want to die here . - Weather should get better over the next . - Get some beef we 're only going . - Jensen ! - Yo ! - Just one more shot ! - Come on ! You guys , this is awesome . So , Mr. Hauser , tell us about cooking on the trail . Well , I like to keep it as simple and light as possible . Therefore ... I give you ... dehydrated Mountain Chili . Delicious . You 're normally a vegetarian , right ? - Seriously ? - Yeah . Well , I don 't know ... Look here , I have macaroni and cheese , huh ? Mmm ! Alright . So what we do is boil some water . You 're using snow , though ? Yeah . We need to conserve our fresh water , but don 't worry . Boiling snow will kill any bacteria that 's in there . - That smells amazing . - JP , so you are king of king . Dude , you might want to wait it up ! You burn your mouth . Idiot ! Why would you give me that , when you knew how hot it was ? - I still can 't taste anything . - Serves you right . - That looks fresh everybody ! - What 's that ? Chocolate ? Anyone ? - Oh , that looks good . - You had that the whole time ? I sleep fine anywhere . - There was a surprise for you too , Denise . - Really ? What is that ? A little earlier when I was chopping up some wood . Thank you . Nice . - It 's life size . - What do I do with it ? - I can show you later if you want . - I 'm sure you can . How many nights have we got with these guys ? Uh two . Tasty ! How 's everyone 's pepperoni ? It 's good . - Want some ? - No , thanks . Oh , Jensen , show me your beautiful eyes . - That is sexy . - Is it sexy ? How is your first experience on a professional film set working out ? How is this a professional film set ? This is a professional ... This is best of the best , top league , man . It 's fun , man . How you holding up with the hike ? - It 's fine . Easy ... - Yeah . Yeah really ? - In my sleep . - Come at me hike . Come at me hike ! Come at me mountain ! I was hoping you could lead the expedition tomorrow . I think we 're gonna stick with A-fab ... It 's his confidence that does it for me . And in a few other things he did for you , huh ? Jesus ... I didn 't even hear that , and I 'm glad ... - You didn 't want to hear it at all ... - It was hilarious . Really ? - Isn 't that beautiful ? - What ? The Northern Lights . Oh , right . Yeah , it 's very ... lovely . - How is your tongue ? - Fine . You know , if you 're not interested in the aurora borealis , Denise 's tent is over there . Believe it or not , I 'm not actually proving underneath right now . Okay , what are you doing ? In the week leading up to the incident , there were reports of orange lights in the sky . Six totally separate witnesses . - Aliens ! - That 's what most people think . The official response was : " Unusual atmospheric conditions " . So ... moonlight reflecting off clouds , things like that . But you don 't believe that . Hey ! You guys should get some sleep ! We get an early enough start , we should hit the site tomorrow . - Okay ! - What ? Big day . Yeah , I 'm just gonna ... be a minute . Okay . What was that ? - What was what ? - That sound ! Never mind . - Holly ! Get up ! - What ? - Something was here ! - I 'm coming . - You gotta see this ! - It 's just Jensen , screwing around . - Holy shit ! - What the hell ... ! - Okay , we 're rolling . - Denise ? - I don 't like this . Denise , if anything was going to happen , it would have happened last night . You don 't know that . I wouldn 't put you in any danger . I know that it 's weird , but that 's why we have to get it on film , okay ? All right , whatever . Can you guys wait a sec ? Thanks ! You 're a dick . Ok . So we woke up this morning and we found something weird . Footprints . Lurking in between these two rocks and around the tents . The shape is weird . See how big that one is ? And then the other one is even bigger . Two different sets , two different people . - Oh ! People ? - I 'm not talking about Yetis , Jensen . Oh come on ! Look at the size of these things ! What else could do that ? I don 't know ! A bear , a snow tiger ? - What ? A snow tiger ? - Snow tigers are all extinct , genius ! It gets weirder . Anyone hiking in this kind of snow , needs specialized boots . They need to have a lot of grip , so they either have spikes or very defined grooves . But these are smooth . Whoever it was , they were barefoot . Now Andy tells us that , as low as the temperature gets at night here , - you 'd lose your toes in 10 minutes . - Which would explain the Yeti . - It 's not a freaking Yeti ! - How do you know ? - Because Yetis don 't freaking exist ! - You don 't exist ! For God sake , Jensen ! Okay , we 're rolling . None of the footprints lead into or out of the camp . It 's like something dropped out of the sky , walked around in barefoot while we were sleeping , and then took off again . - Do Yetis fly too ? - They might . Hey , could we pack up now , please ? - Are there really Snow Tigers here ? - No , there are no frigging tigers here . Come on . We don 't have to cross that , do we ? No . You guys alright ? You 've been quiet all morning . Yeah , we 're fine . You don 't seem fine . We just don 't like being mess with , that 's all . Do you think that we 're messing with you ? No , we think Bigfoot was checking out our campsite last night . How could we possibly fake that ? Oh , you 're right Holly . No ones ever faked footprints in the snow before . He 's right , Holls . It 's cool to cut loose and have some fun , but look around you . It 's the last place in the world you want have everyone freaked out . You don 't know what you 're talking about . So needless to say we 're all over one edge this morning . Holly ! Do you hear that ? So we were searching where we think those strange sounds came from . We listened to the tape and no one can even begin begin to explain what it is ... and then we found these . Just like at the campsite , no tracks in or out . We 're getting a little freaked out . Holly ! Come look at this ! More footprints ! - What is it ? - It 's a weather tower . They put them in remote areas like this . That propeller at the top measures wind speed . No , not anymore . It doesn 't . - Whoa whoa whoa , what are you doing ? - Look at the footprints . Whatever made that sound , was here , and I want to know why . - Well ? - Hang on . What the ... ? Are you okay ? You alright ? - Yeah . - Are you sure ? Holly ... come on . I try . - This isn 't safe , Holly ! - Yeah , that 's what it looks like . It 's not nothing ! It is a omen ! We should just leave right now ! - Denise , can you just ... ? - What about the footprints ... ? It 's probably from an animal . Please , can you just give us a minute ! Hey hey hey , come on . Look , she 's just messing around with us for her stupid movie . Come on . - Okay ? - Yeah . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm just a bit freaked out , that 's all . Well , you know . Everyone 's a little run ... I um ... I heard about this mountain pass , in China , where birds fly into walls and people and animals go crazy , and die . And it 's all because the wind generates a 4 mega Hertz sound that makes people go insane . - Do not you think that that ... ? - The wind is making us crazy ? No . Jensen . We all saw the tape and heard whatever it was . Please tell me what 's wrong . I 've heard them before . Jesus , Jensen . I had a ... I had a really bad trip when I was in high school . Like on acid . Okay , I 've never done it . The funniest part is kind of like all your brain cells are firing at the same time . For the first time in your life , then it got a little weird , and ... I heard them . And they were chasing me and I was running ... and next thing I remember , the cops were picking me , and I was in the middle of the street screaming about demons . And ... now I 'm out here with you . - And here they are . - Okay , hear me . When I was a kid ... Yah , I used to have these dreams . About this place . It was exactly the same , the mountains , the snow , everything . And it was like there was this magnet , pulling me toward it . And , you know , I get out here and then there 's this door ... A door . And I don 't want to open it but I have to . And then , like on the other side there just this darkness . Like blackness and it swallows me up . And I used to wake up like absolutely screaming and my parents said that I was having those night terrors , Then they took me to a shrink , and he put me on pills and nothing worked . Okay . And then I saw that news report about the scientists , and ... I just knew . I said , that 's it . Oh my God , that 's the place that I 've been dreaming about . And this is how I know that we were all going to do what nobody else has been able to do . And we 're going to figure out what happened to those people . Okay . We are just meant to be here too . Aha . So how 's that for crazy ? You 've been hanging out with me for too long and you 're supposed to be our Velma . - What 's that ? - Scooby Doo . - The dog ? - Yeah ... No , no , Velma ... You know she 's ... in the gang she 's like the smart , intelligent woman with short hair , glasses ... - I 've never seen it . - Okay , whatever . Unless you guys want to camp here , we should get going . I definitely don 't want to camp here , okay . This mountain really is amazing . Did I already mention how much I hate these freaking snowshoes ? Anybody ? Nobody ? - Guys wait ! - Come on , slowpoke . Guys wait ! This is it ! We 're here ! - Oh , thank God ! - Are you sure ? I 've seen the pictures a hundred times . This is it . This is where it happened . This is the Dyatlov Pass . 53 years ago today , nine people set up camp on this very ground , ate dinner and went to bed . At some point between 9 and 11 o 'clock that night , something that Russian officials could only identify as an " unknown compelling force " caused all nine of them to flee from their tent in such terror , that they ripped through it and fled into the night , that was 17 ° C below zero . You 're gonna love this footage , Andy . You look like a TV chef . Oh yeah ? Which one ? The gay one . - That 's harsh . - That 's real cute , Jensen . Rustem Slobodin , 23 , the first of them to fall . Igor Dyatlov , 23 , the group 's leader and the most experienced hiker , it was probably his idea to try to the tents . Zinaida Kolmogorova , 22 , she was just a year older than I am now , She got the closest to the camp before succumbing . The only victim showing any sign of a struggle . She was missing her tongue and a large portion of her oral cavity . Lyudmila Dubinina , 21 . Nicolai Thibeaux-Brignolles . Alexander Zolotariov . Alexander Kolevatov . The cause of death for all the victims was determined to be hypothermia , but Rustem and Nicolai also had severely crushed skulls , and Lyudmila and Alexander Zolotariov had a number of broken ribs . But none of the bodies had any defensive injuries . No external injuries whatsoever . Somehow , something managed to crush the skulls of two men and shattered the ribs Lyudmila and Alexander without leaving so much as a bruise . Also , Alexander 's body tested positive for high levels of radiation . Hello ! Where out here , did Alexander encounter so much radiation ? And why only him ? Georgiy Krivonischenko , 24 . Yuri Doroshenko , 21 . While the others ran , they sat quietly by their dying fire and calmly froze to death . - What 's up , Andy ? - Nothing . Doesn 't look like " nothing " . The GPS is all screwed up , should have alerted us when we got to the site . I 'm lucky to have spotted it . And I suppose you think that that 's my fault too . - I don 't know . Did you screw with it ? - No ! If she did , she managed to get over to my watch too . My altimeter is toast . And look at this . My compass is a Suunto . It got me to the Himalayas , and has always worked perfectly everywhere but here . I think we should go . - What ? We just got here ! - We don 't have to go back yet but ... we 're flying blind without a GPS or a reliable map . - What 's wrong with the map ? - We shouldn 't be here yet . What do you mean ? According to the map we 've covered 14 miles today . There 's no way we could have gotten here before midnight . So what ? So we were fast . Look , let 's just pack up and keep moving until the compass stops acting up . There 's obviously ... some kind of , I don 't know , magnetic field in the rock here or something . We can start up somewhere new , nobody be able to tell the difference . It won 't match the footage that we shot before though . Screw the footage , Holly ! Something obviously is wrong . We should just leave . If we start packing now we can make it . No no , no , no . I don 't want to camp here either , but by the time we get packed up and get moving , we 're gonna be hiking in the dark . No good . Guys , it 's for one night . You know , people lived for thousands of years without watches and GPS . I think that we can make one night . It 's what we all came here for . Alright , I 'll go start dinner . Thank you . Hey ! I 'm learning date night over there , just starting to feel like a third wheel . I just don 't understand what she sees in somebody like him . - I mean he 's such an arrogant ... - Confident ... - self-important ... douche-bag - rugged ... Yeah , you know , there 's room in that tent . I 'm sure if you want to go and join them ? Oh ! Maybe for you too , I 'm sure you 'll have a boyfriend as nice as Andy one day , so ... What are you doing ? Nothing , I 'm just gonna ... Shit ! Thank you . This is one of the reasons that you can 't meet anyone . No , I can 't meet anyone , cause everybody thinks I 'm dating you . Oh you wish ... Those thing about what Ranger Rick said about this being a magnetic field ... Yeah ? What if it is not ? Okay . Why don 't you tell the folks at home what you got there . So this is a fairly basic Geiger counter . Um , without going too complicated , it detects levels of radiation . As you can hear ... there is definitely radiation in this area . It could be uranium in the rock here . It 's nothing dangerous , but it 's way more than we should be seeing . Yeah , and the source of it ... it 's definitely coming from here . Let 's check it out . - Over this way . - Watch your step . Lucille does not like this . I think that we found something . Hey Jensen . See how the ice is thinner there ? - Yeah . - The snow ... Yeah ? What about it ? It looks like someone 's been here , maybe like , even in the last few days . Be careful ! Okay . Here , right up here . - Holly , be careful ! - Okay . Wait . Jensen , I don 't think that this is a rock . - Shit ! Are you getting this ? - I 'm getting it , I 'm getting it . Jensen , this ... Be careful ! - Can you see this ? - Yes . Keep going , keep going ! Come on ! - What is that ? - I don 't know . - Oh my God ! - Oh , Jensen ! Do you see that ? - Tell the camera what you see ! - Oh Jensen ! What do you see ? Come on ! It 's like a cave or something ... Oh my God , Jensen it 's ... You gotta put the camera down and come help me . - There 's a door ! - What ? Put the camera down . I got to get to some film . This is so weird ! Of course it 's weird , Jensen . Look ! There 's a door in the middle of the mountain ! It locks from the outside . It 's designed to keep something in . - Yeah , but what ? - Holly ! Look there ! Come on ! The Russian government has spent a lot of time and effort building a big , solid door on the side of a mountain to keep whatever 's inside in there . - I don 't think we should going ... - Jensen ! What the hell are we here for ? Don 't you want to know if the unknown compelling force is a Yeti , or an alien , or a Soviet engineered Superman ? I want to know what happened here and the answer is behind that door ! So would you just help me open it , please ? Okay ? Wait . - It 's moving ... - It 's already opened . It 's frozen shut at the seams . Oh , that 's good . That means that we can get it opened by squeezing off the ice ... Okay , I shall get some hot water and we can go ... No , no no . Not that ! Jesus ! - No , because ... - What ? They 're already very jumpy okay , and this is just going to go freak them out , and ... just ... I don 't want to move camp okay , so ... we 'll tell them about it tomorrow . We 'll just leave it now , and then we 'll come back , okay ? Hey guys ! What 's up ? - You want to go to bed ? - Yeah , sure . - Good night . - Good night . - Good night , Holly . - Good night . Good night , guys . What are you reading ?

Just let me put this down ... You know , it 's impossible to get warm when you 're sitting on snow all the time . Yeah . I think my ass has been numb since we left Vizhaj . Did you guys find anything with the Geiger counter ? No , perfectly safe . Oh that 's good ! I guess , I mean , I know you 're hoping to find something for your movie . There is still time . Young Love . I won 't be too sure about that ... Thatcher 's a good dude , but not sure if he 's boyfriend material . No ? I think they look cute . It 's because he is the master of the " trail hookup " . The " trail hookup " ? Yeah , that it is ... Oh man . The " trail hookup " . You get a girl out in the middle of nowhere especially when it is cold , she needs someone to snuggle up with ... How romantic , oh God ! - It 's not the worst of it ... - He has herpes ? No , not that I know of . You know that camera on his phone ? Oh , no ! He records it It 's not just for shooting landscapes , yeah , like a digital notch on the bedpost . No ! Denise ! She 's going down ... So what is your trail game ? I 'd like to introduce you to my young friend ... Colonel Whiskey . - Hello , Colonel . - Yes , please . John Patrick Hauser , Are you trying to get me drunk ? See that I had to wait for a little " paradoxical undressing " . Mmm . Nice . - You really go through ? - Don 't worry , it 's just a " trail hookup " . - What 's a " trail hookup " ? - You 're still in the running , Casanova . I 'm not sure if I wanted that guys . Sloppy seconds . You could always curl up with Lucille , right ? Hey man , you laugh , but ... if it was legal in the state of Oregon to marry a camera , then ... I would do it . But unfortunately it is not , so we gonna have to keep our relationship professional ... mostly . Well , I am going to ... - going to sleep . - Right on . - Good night . - Go ahead . Sweet dreams . I 'm sorry we accused you of faking those footprints . It 's alright . If I didn 't know that I didn 't do it , I would have thought exactly the same thing . No , we jumped to a conclusion that we shouldn 't have . I expected a slap , not so a little bit . I know better . Well , if you want to make it up to me , you could ... give me something warm to snuggle up with . - Seriously ? - Yeah . Yes . It 's ... six a.m. That makes it the third day , And ... it 's time to meet Denise . - What are you doing ? - Huh ? - Making our own movie . - Are you ready again ? You got to look so surprised ? I 'm not surprised , I 'm impressed . Impressed ? Turn that off . - What ? - Turn it off ! Don 't have to yell while having sex ... - Andy ! - Oh , better way of moving this part of the show . Oh ! the dinner we had in Ivdel ? - We weren 't even there in Ivdel ... ? - Andy ! Shit ! What was that ? - You heard that right ? - Yeah , fuck . Guys ? Everybody okay ? What was that ? What the hell is that ? Shit ! Denise ! Grab your equipment ! Denise , get up ! Avalanche ! Oh my God ! Come on , let 's go ! Denise ! Run , run ! Come on ! Denise , come ! Denise ! No ! Where is Andy ? Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! - Denise ! - Denise ! Denise ! She 's gone ! Denise is dead ! No way man , she could still be breathing somewhere ! She 's gone ! - Settle down . - She 's gone ! You left her ! - You left her ! - Screw you ! She was just another trail hookup to you wasn 't she ? I said shut up , right now ! He 's right ! There 's nothing we can do for her ! - They goddamn killed her ! - It was an avalanche ! Oh wake up man ! They tried to kill us . They tried to bury us , so look like an accident ! You crazy bastard ! * * * doesn 't happen in the real world ! Are you telling me you didn 't see those charges ? Huh ? Or was that a horde of Ukrainian exploding mountain ghosts ? - You don 't know what happened ! - What ? What ? You want anyone find us , then you look around ! I had to apply for permits and submit travel plans . JP , they knew exactly where we were and when we 'll be there . They waited until we were asleep , Jensen is right , Somebody is trying to kill us ! - Jesus , Holly . You too ? - Oh , God ! Okay . So tell me , who is it ? The military , man ! - This is serious ! - Great , eh . Great at cold war , prove it ! Shut up ! Both of you , shut up ! Okay ? I don 't want to believe that Denise is gone , but she is , okay ? Now we have to pull together and focus on not losing anybody else . - Andy , what do we do ? - My pack and my first aid kit . Okay . What now ? Tell us what to do ? You guys , you got to reset my legs . It 's the bones ... Okay , Jensen , take the camera . - I can do this , it 's okay . - Be careful with my leg ! Sorry , sorry , sorry ! Andy ! I need to cut the pant leg , okay . So you just ... - Okay , cut it , cut it , cut it . - I 'm gonna be really quick ! Just don 't ... Wait , I promise I 'm going to be gentle . - Shit ! - Shit , okay . Andy , just say calm . It 's gonna be okay . Okay , okay , that 's fine , that 's fine . We just gonna do it this way . JP ... come here a second , I 'm going to need you to get something . - Oh , God ! Ok , ok , ok ... - Oh , how is it ? - Ok , it 's so good . - How is it ? It 's ok , it 's ok , it 's ok . It 's alright , it 's okay . I got that . It 's okay . It 's not as bad as you thought . It 's ... Jensen , please go get a piece of wood or something we can make a splint with . - No , no , no ! - It 's not so bad as you thought , you 're gonna be okay . - Alright hold on . - I promise , I promise you I 'll just ... This is gonna hurt a little , it 's just gonna hurt a little , okay ? You got to reset it , you got to reset it now . - Alright , brother . - Yeah . I 'm a going three , okay ? - Take a deep breath , get ready , ok . - Yes . - Are you ready ? - Do it anyway . Alright , on three . Ready ? One .. That wasn 't so bad ! That wasn 't so bad ! Not for you ! - It 's all over . - No ! - Okay . - Is this thing really on ? Turn it off ! I don 't want you all to see me like this ! Turn ... This set won 't work . I paid for the international plan . This is so stupid . We need help . We have to send up a flare . - If whoever did this sees the flare ... - Nobody ... did this ! You don 't know , JP . I mean , maybe Jensen is right . No ! This is why Andy risked his life to go back and get the pack , okay . It 's late enough when we * * * , they have to see it . Do you have to do that ? No matter how this ends , I want there to be a record of what happened to us , so we don 't end up another Dyatlov mystery . If we gonna do this , can we just get some cover first ? I don 't think that we can move Andy . What was that ? - What ? - That look ... What the hell is going on ? We found something before when we were out with the Geiger counter . What did you find ? A door . What ? We 've been freezing in this freaking snow all day , and there 's a freaking bunker here ? ! But we couldn 't open it anyway and the radiation was ... strong . How strong ? Not dangerous , but ... Unbelievable ! Did you plant the footprints ? No ! I didn 't plant the footprints . I don 't believe you . Fine , don 't believe me . Okay . If somebody did start this avalanche , the reason why is in there , right ? Yeah . Let 's send up the flares , we 'll get some people out here , and now , wait , whoever is doing this has no option of killing us anymore . Okay . Come on ! What ? Orange lights in the sky . JP , I 'm so sorry . I should have told , but ... you were just so worked up about the compass , and ... and the map , and ... I didn 't mean for any of this to happen . You ... You followed the step by step plan that killed nine people . What did you think was going to happen ? I don 't know . I just ... I have just always been drawn to this place , and ... I don 't know why , I can 't explain . I didn 't mean for this . Do you think that anybody saw the flare ? I don 't know . We have to set out there much longer . I 'm going to rip that goddamn door , seeing radiation or not , okay ? Yeah . Okay . Looks like it 's blueberry pancakes or mac and cheese ? You got to with blueberry for breakfast . Good to eat . Hey Jensen ... - Yeah , what 's up ? - Hi , man ... I 'm sorry about Denise . I really am . You can think whatever you want to think , but I 'm sorry . Yeah , me too . Oh , shit ! Somebody 's coming . Look ! Help ! We need help ! We saw flares ! Are you alright ? Our friend is hurt ! - Don 't look . He 's lying . - What ? They don 't have any packs . How did they get here so fast ? - They were following us . - You see , I told you ! - They are ones that set the targets ! - Go ! - Who ? - The military ! - Move out ! Go go go now ! - We 're not leaving you , Andy ! Well just go ! I can 't go anywhere ! Go ! - Lift him up . - We 'll get you up , come on . - I can 't go anywhere ! - One , two , three . Okay ! - I can 't ... - Shit ! I can 't go , I can 't , I can 't ! Just go ! Don 't help me ! Go now ! - Jensen , the door ! - Okay , got it . - JP , you 're gonna follow us , okay ? - Wait . Alright , give me the flare gun . At the pack . Give me the flare gun . Hurry up ! We got to go ! Now ! - Go ! - I 'm not going to leave you her ! - JP , come on ! - We got to go ! I will send help ! Jesus , they 're shooting at us ! What the ... ? Holly ! Oh , Jesus ! - No ! Go ! - Oh my God ! - Come on ! - JP ! Get up ! Get up ! - JP , come on ! - Shit ! Come on , Holly ! Get up ! - Open the door . - Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Open it ! It 's already opened . Just frozen shut . Guys ! Guys ! - Shit ! - Oh , shit ! It 's opened ! Get inside . Come on ! Get in ! Holly ! Shut the door ! Shut the damn door ! * * * The lock 's on the outside ! Help me hold it closed ! - Oh God , they locked it ! - JP ? - Yeah ? - Are you okay ? No , I 'm bleeding a lot . Put pressure on it . - JP it 's alright . - Just stay still for a second . I 'll turn off the camera , just help me * * * . God ! Okay , I got ... I got it . Oh my God ! Who do you see ? It 's a tunnel ! - What ? - We 're in a tunnel . Okay . What do you see ? A switch ... a power switch . - Trip it ! - Okay , okay . Alright . - It works . - Oh thank God ! - We need to barricade the door - Why ? Because it 's a lock from the outside . They can get in whenever they want . No ones coming in here , man . They 're not going to waste the bullets . - Damn it , Jensen ... - Now look , have you looked around ? No one is coming to save us . We 're on our own . They know that in a few days we 're gonna dehydrate ... then they don 't have to worry about any mess . Then that 's it , is it ? They just lock the door and come back in a week . Unless we can find a way out . - Can you walk ? - Yeah . Okay . Be careful , be careful . Shit ! Okay . - We go straight . - Okay . - Jensen , stay close . - Okay . Let 's go slow , go slow . Okay . * * * - Go go go go ! - Shit , other tunnel , other tunnel . JP JP JP ... What ? What ! What ? I just felt something . What ? Something is here ! - Follow me . - Something is here , Jensen , I swear ! There 's nobody down here , guys . Come on ! Shit ! - Which way ? - Left . - Take it easy . Go slow . Go slow . - Alright . The lights are still on here . - Stay close . - Okay . Oh shit . - Don 't go to far ahead . - No . Jesus ! What is this place ? It 's a ... a lab , I think . If it was . What happened in here ? Who knows ? Sit down , let me see where you 're hit . Wait ... Here . Use this . This gonna hurt . I 'm sorry . Just rest here for a few minutes . I found an opening . - Be careful . - Yeah , no problem . Look at this place . Holly , come here . Look at this . - What is it ? - It 's a log book , I think . I know this word . - You do ? - Yeah . I saw it lots of times when I was researching this . What does it mean ? Killed in action . Of course it does . You think you can read anything else ? Just the dates . 1945 . 1959 . The year the hikers were killed . And then it stopped . What ? It 's a boat . Eldridge . Is it the USS Eldridge , from the Philadelphia Experiment . What Philadelphia Experiment ? Come on ! Have you been under a rock or something ? In 1943 , the United States government commissioned experiments on that ship . What kind of experiments ? Teleportation . Oh , my God ! There were rumors that people wound up fused to the ship , but no one has ever seen anything like this . These pictures are like top , top secret . Someone could have been killed for this . Oh , my God ! Okay . We must get out of here . - Yeah . - JP , can you move ? - No . - Oh shit . I 'm not leaving you here , okay , so ... think of something . Just find a way out , okay ? Okay , when I do , I 'm coming back and I 'm dragging you out myself , okay ? Let 's go ! Jesus Christ ! Uh , it 's a naturally formed cave . I don 't think they tunneled this one out . Looks like it 's been widened a little bit , but that 's it . What are you ... ? A spelunker now ? Look at this . There 's got to be a nuclear power cell . That 's why there 's electricity here . Alexander was here . This is where he picked up the radiation . There has to be a way out . Be careful ! Oh , my God ! What is that ? - It still works . - There . Give me that . I told you someone had been here recently . Who is he ? Military . Why is he down here ? If you 're thinking about killing five Americans to keep a secret that has been buried for 50 years , won 't you send somebody to make sure that was still a secret to keep ? - What are you doing ? - Checking something . Oh shit ! That thing we found in the weather tower . That was his tongue ? How did it get up there ? He must have let something out . That 's why the door was unlocked . They could have been doing some kind of experiments on them , maybe ? You said there was a lot of that going on . Oh , my God ! Holly , look at the bullet holes . This wasn 't a lab . It was an execution chamber . Oh , Christ ! Holly , what is that ? It looks like one of the soldiers from the book out there . I don 't understand . - Jensen ! - These things , they ... They don 't look right . Maybe that 's what he let out . What the hell was that ? Wait ! That door wasn 't opened before . Was it ? Be careful ! What was that ? JP ? Oh God ! Something 's here , Jensen . - Oh , no ! - Oh , my God ! - Is that blood ? - We need to get out of here , okay ? - What is that ? - I don 't know . - Some kind of light ? - No , underneath it . Let me see that . That 's the same with camera . There 's still battery life . Check what 's on that . No recording ! I just want to get you saying that on camera ! - You must go now ! - Come on now leave . The Cold War 's over . We 're friends now . I don 't ... I don 't . Please fast forward before the battery dies . He 's dead . Stop ! What 's on there . - No recording ! - I just want you saying that on ... Shit ! That 's impossible ! No no , maybe not ... Remember the Eldridge , from the Philadelphia Experiment ? It was supposed to teleport from Philadelphia to Norfolk . - So ? - So ... It is supposed to have arrived in Norfolk 10 minutes before it left Philadelphia . Then you 're telling me that 's a goddamn time machine ? No . I 'm telling you that no one , not our top scientists , not the government , not theirs knew what was going on . They didn 't know what they 're screwing with . Holly , all of these experiments were abandoned . The crew of the Eldridge , the ones that weren 't ... fused to a bulkhead , they went insane . Some of them ... some of them changed ... Mutated ... People weren 't meant to do these things . JP ! Jensen , come on ! Come on ! JP ! Jensen ! Jensen ! What are you doing ? Get over here ! - Where did they go ? - They ... they came back for me . Oh no . I 'm going to get you . I 'm going to get you , shift together right now ! - JP ! - Come ! They 're on the ceiling ! On the ceiling ! Jensen ! - Oh Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ ! - Jensen ! - Where it come ? - I don 't know ! Look , Holly , it 's up there , it 's up there ! - Jensen , where did it go ? - I don 't know ! - Where did he go ? - Get JP ! Jensen ! We gonna get him away from that door ! When I do , you run ! Got it ? Got it ! - Run ! Watch out ! - Come on , come on ! - This way ! - I 'm behind you ! Run ! Go ! Jensen , this way ! Go ! Go ! Why did they let us go ? Why did they stop ? I don 't know . We should be dead . Why didn 't they kill us when they have the chance ? What the hell is that ? It 's like a giant fossil . - What are they doing ? - They 're waiting for us . JP ! I said that I would go back for him ... No , we can 't go back for him . You saw what they did to him . If we open that door , they 're gonna do the same thing to us . We 're trapped , and they know it . We 're in here because this is where they wanted us to be . - Holly , are you seeing that ? - Yeah . Do it again . - You recorded that , right ? - Yeah . Good . I know it , I know it ... - What ? - Teleportation . Those creatures , they way that they disappeared ... become ... intangible . They can teleport . But not through the doors down here . So they are locked from the outside . There 's gotta be a connection between those things and this place . They came from here . They came through this . That makes sense ... Kind of like a ... giant ... " wormhole " . Like a ... transporter . - How did it get here ? - I don 't know . Holly , the Mansi , the natives , Alya said that they 've been here for thousands of years . I don 't know how this thing works but I bet these drawings are theirs . So they built a teleporter ? I don 't know , maybe . Hell , maybe they just found this thing down in a cave and put the drawings on it . It could be some kind of alien technology . Maybe they were trying to weaponize it . What if there are more portals like this around the world ? If those things came out of one of them , it could explain all kinds of unsolved mysteries . The Eldridge , the Mothman sightings in Point Pleasant ... Who knows what else ? Flashlight 's dead . Shit ! - Jensen , I can 't see ! - It 's okay . Just take my hand . There you go . You got it . Watch your step . Okay , okay . We 're gonna unlock the door . Reach out in front and sit down , okay . You got it . Alright . It happened ... What ? I opened the door and darkness followed me , just like in my dream . Hey , come on . Hey , hey , hey . - It 's one of your dreams , just a dream ... - I sorry . Jensen , we 're never getting out of here ! I 'm sorry ... Is the camera on ? - I can see the light . - Yeah . Alright . I have an idea . Not tic-tac-toe again , Jensen . You 're just killing the battery . No . In there ... What about ? Losing holes in the space-time continuum ... and obliterating our puny human brains ? That 's my plan . She ... has got no control , has no buttons . What means it either goes to one fixed place , or anywhere . Anywhere ? That 's all I can think of . But what if ... you picture somewhere ... clear in your mind , and you concentrate on it , and that is where it takes you . You knew this thing there is no place like home , that easy . That easy . And we won 't wind up fused to the mountain or something ? I don 't know . I hope not . We 're gonna die here , Jensen . It 's this ... or them . Okay . What do we do ? Um , I 'm doing a lot of guessing here . But I think that it should be some place that ... is still fresh in your memory , Some place nearby , some place that you can picture clearly . Outside the mountain . Oh ! You mean the other side of the door ? Certainly the freshest thing in our minds , and now that the door is locked , it will protect us from those things , right ? Okay . Okay . I 'm scared . " Everything is all right , and everybody has to do exactly what he does " . Where is that from ? " Slaughterhouse Five " . I never read it . Don 't let go . Other bodies . Vallik !

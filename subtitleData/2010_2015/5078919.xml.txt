 Hey. what 's up. eveybody ? This is Jon M. Chu . And this is Lorenzo di Bonaventura . the producer . Ethan and John. they did all the ninia star sounds for those stars right there . It 's always hard to deal with these multiple logos . So many companies . gets to create a little mood atmosphere as you sit down in the movie and relax . who I actually went to college with . it was raining so hard you couldn 't even get out of the car ? And we were desperately looking for a location we could actually afford . And we had to build that giant . giant fence that went all the way back . There 's a scene that comes in right after this that we always loved . And I think for Jon and I it 's always a little bittersweet " how to get that other scene in " you know ? It started with them on the grass whispering to each other . and we were like right intimate with them . Well. it was a cool scene in that in an action stealth mode . and sort of figure out who they are on the fly. you know . There 's no tower there . building it from the ground up . Actually. in many ways. this movie couldn 't have gotten made at the scale because we had this insane facility . Yeah. like the rockets. basically . for the shuttles . this gigantic space they had for transporting these things . Yeah . 500 / o of the movie within a 5-mile range . - Yeah . A couple miles . - Yeah . It 's crazy . When we first went in it. we were like . " You guys are kidding. right ? We drove through it . They say that building is so big that it would rain indoors . There 's a lot of characters in G.l. Joe , and it 's one of the strengths . because you don 't have enough time. really . So this opening sequence here was designed of who the characters are. what they do . and we could get into the actual character motivations . what are their goals . when we came up with this idea . and reintroducing these characters to people who didn 't watch the first movie . as well as pushing new information forward This scene. I always loved this surprise . And it also firmly established what great chemisty these two guys had together . because they had such a naturalistic attitude with one another . I remember watching the first take of it and going . - Yeah . - You know ? Usually you replace screens . any TV screens or stuff . that we actually recorded the video game prior . And then we 'd play back while they were in the scene . That 's actually real timing . which gets tricky . - Yeah. yeah . - Yeah . and being incredibly accessible . and funny . That 's a really rare thing for two movie stars As different as they are. they also have those same qualities amongst them . And I remember we needed to give the audience permission to laugh . and that helped. that scene itself helped to not take ourselves too seriously . they could turn around and save the world . This idea that our writers came up with . Reese and Wernick . I think it gives the movie a sort of gravity that 's unusual And it 's amazing when you do something on a purely creative level when you see events occur . there 's a lot of things you 're suddenly going . " Wow " you know ? and suddenly has an additional weight to it . 'cause you had to be on a gimbal . It has to ... but it was fun to do . In fact. all the guns ... They 're so expensive . and they 're so time-consuming . " You can lust fake it . You can just shake the camera . " and it actually makes a big. big difference . is that we once had The Rock doing a Patton quote . and get a sense of how contemporay it could be . What 's interesting is. you know . they cary different weights . I think as a filmmaker . You lust end up with a choice where you emotionally think The Patton quote had a lot of strengths to it But the Jay-Z quote had a contemporay thing You 're not seeing where it 's coming . go to Duke as he says he accepts his fate . It wasn 't in the script . It wasn 't purposely done . And that building. actually . is part of the NASA facility. too . Yeah . we were given a lot of money . a lot of the big tentpole movies have been given . So a lot of our creative energy was put to . And this building kept being our advantage. I mean. this is ... is actually the fuel tank that they put on the shuttle . I mean . look at the scale of this thing . which is crazy . which we 'll talk a lot about . is a guy named Paul Borne . But he was an amazing rock climber . and a great rigger and stuntman . that we would not have felt without a guy like that onboard. you know ? And the actors need to feel comfortable suddenly going down ... Yeah . The height of that . that 's all ' cause he 's rigged up . One of the ideas . Jon. I think you had . was . " How do you differentiate him ? " So he really fully went after it . We had a bunch of Na _ SEALs on the movie . They hold guns in a certain way . I think that 's actually almost more important than anything . And it 's lust a detail. too . " Hey. how do you get from Place A to Place B ? " and then the other actors would watch and learn from that . Details that I wouldn 't ever know even. so ... which is kind of where l learnt it . because. I mean. what they go through is so much harder than what we do . We may go . " Christ. we 're working 12-14-hour days . " A debate that we had from the vey beginning was . " What kind of uniforms do they have ? " so we gave them different camo patterns . if you 're going into a place to have different camo patterns . - lndividuality. yeah . - Exactly . And the Joes are a conglomeration . which is part of what we were doing . and that they all come from different places . And they all had their own personalities . and it was like an all-star team . Again. there 's an actual firing range on the NASA facility We were like . " Where the hell are we gonna do this ? " Yeah. literally . Yeah. I think we had a couple of them that ... You know. it 's so about the kind of fun And it was a really important thing to really fall in love because what 's about to happen is really grim . after really falling in love with them . This is the real gun range where we would go to train our actors and stuff . You can see all the hills behind them are all CG . - The magic of Holl _ ood . - Yeah . - Yes . - We kept thinking . It 's lust funny . And to fire it. you can see how it pushes back on Dwayne . - And the barrel gets so hot . - Remember how hea _ it was ? Exactly . but there 's also a lot improvised . and had real fun giving each other a hard time . that they were doing at each other . Jonathan Pyce. though. boy. huh ? because obviously his role in the movie is so important on both fronts . There was actually a scene right in between there . to get to the door. but there was a ... lt 's one of those ones where sometimes Yes . How did the process go for you as you were tying to visualise it ? This was like a motion-control rig that you shoot one part at a time . And then you move the camera the way you need . And then once you pick your take that you like . And he has to dress up as the other guy . and it has to be exactly the same . And it 's a really crazy process . you have to make decisions on the set . And you have to be pe _ ect . you can 't go back to shoot this stuff . Jonathan 's such a good actor . - without the other half . - Yes . And then he turns around and does it . It 's not a sequence that we had to cut around pe _ ormance . in this case him . it can be tricky to time it . It was bizarre how easily it cut together . And you wanted to show that we weren 't cheating it too much . You wanted to see him walk all the way around . and to show that these are two different people . There 's a lot of iokes he made about the President 's wife . And " the quicker blower-upper. baby . " And talks about interns . bringing back the interns . " What would a President have underneath his building ? " Would it be ... " Like. what is it ? For such a simple space . It was . " Exactly who is flying these helicopters ? " " Are they Cobra soldiers that are flying it ? What are they ? It was a big conversation piece by the studio . And eveybody ... We all kind of ... lt kind of went around and around . I think . because it was lust ... Yeah . this area is actually a sandpit in ... - lt was in St Francisville . - St Francisville. there you go . - we found this huge sandpit . - Baton Rouge . which was one of the things when we first went there. we 're like . 'Cause that 's not your vision of it . You know. your vision is bayou . - God. it was miserable . - And my first action movie . That Hummer is a real blowup of a Hummer . It was a big rig . Eveyone 's super nervous . And you have over 300 e _ ras running around . You can 't step in the wrong place . It 's funny how you bring different things . " All right. that thing 's gonna go over there " you know . But you know . one of the things about this was . That ain 't makeup . We 're in a hot desert environment . - At night it was 100 degrees . - Yeah . It was insane . And they 're in this full battle gear . and they couldn 't have been hotter . who was lust so determined that nobody would faint I don 't think I ever saw her without 30 bottles of water in her hand . And this is amazing. this well . The well in the real world. on the top . And we had to tie that all together . And you could be at any part of the well . And it was pretty awesome to shoot in a tank like that . I think if you don 't know its complication . it doesn 't seem all that complicated . and how do you go underwater . the ability to move the camera an _ here . And that really was. you know . - Andrew Menzies. our ... - Our production designer . something that gave you the ability to shoot it in a way that 'Cause we had to fit a whole crew down there . And he literally gave us space to be able to do all that . There 's one shot where he jumps into the well . as if it 's like _ lice in Wonderland , a camera right below him . When he lumped . he dropped the camera with him . In fact . where they 're about to walk up to . But we made an identical set across the way . and then destroy it. and then redress it . for the explosions to show the aftermath . you need a tunnel that high so you can fit your crew and eveyone in . it gives you a sense of reality . We didn 't create ... That 's not a green screen effect . 'cause we have all these guys and girls And we 're like . " Well. we just need to make it simple And the effects that you put on . and the filters . And that move. you know. that was ... for when they would go up the well to be back-to-back like that . But it 's actually really cool . It shows strategy . It communicates something. you know . about. yeah. both the strategy . - They 're not gonna make it alone . - Yes . was take these people who are going to be the heroes of the movie . In fact. and disgrace them . You know. this moment of realisation as they 're looking out. they 're going . There 's anger. there 's sadness . there 's a lot of emotions . you felt for them . and you were behind them . And those people dead in the desert . They 're not mannequins . Those are real people lying in that . This is probably like 120 degrees at this point . 'Cause it was our first week of shooting again . We really wanted to feel that . having all those little errors . all those little te _ ures to it One of the things when you came on . which I so related to . and who to make it with. is. you know . Like you can see how The Rock 's armour has been used before . It 's got hea _ - duty stuff that 's gone through it . communicated a toughness to the movie . And I think that there was a lot of other things that were related to that . of what these people look like really influenced how you feel about it . There was parts where this was gone . 'cause it was a little confusing for people lf you didn 't know the lore . this might be confusing . But Walt Goggins is lust brilliant . Well. really. that opening sequence was really what saved this . understand the trick we were gonna do in this sequence . 'Cause not only was Walt brilliant in it . but he 's a fun guy to be with . So Jon and I were both so incredibly ... Yes . And I love that Walt 's in his casual wear today . - That 's right. yeah . - And that building. we actually built . Yeah. a golf course . So there 's nothing there . It 's just a field . That was insane for me to come into a movie where you could build like that . I remember when we were scouting that other location I looked at you and I said . " l don 't care how good this place is . Yes. I do . That was a cool place. though . - l can 't believe we could recreate that . - l know . that these walls are not real . None of this stuff . and that 's not gonna get eveyone sick . - That was ... - That was a lot of safety stuff . Even if you 've worked on a lot of movies . you don 't realise that how the little things are where we really can get hurt . So I know you love these tubes . and I 'm glad it paid off . the science of it . and then the safety of it on top of it . I love that that 's ... before he becomes Cobra with the silver mask . God. I don 't know. I mean. come on . there 's like 45 versions Not even the visor . The visor . there 's got to be 100. I don 't know . lust the way it has a little brow furrow . I think it 's funny . ' cause you and I had so many debates about both And Jon having grown up with the Joe ... so was determined to keep Cobra cool . This whole section here was so interesting . And then Destro . leaving him behind . 'cause if you don 't know the first movie . you come into this movie . The fact that we even brought him up . we really wanted to do that for the fans . because there 's a lot of people out there who did . This is literally probably our fourth shot of the whole movie . Yeah. we chose the easy stuff first . And that gear is not easy . " How much gear would they keep on at this point ? " Would they even be sweating ? There were so many debates of all those things . Yeah. no. I know . That 's one of the great things . is a guy named Hary Humphries . And you have real service men now who can tell you That 's exactly what they would wear . I 'm sure there 's a few Holl _ ood cut corners . What would they keep . and what would they abandon . this is what soldiers would actually do . which is nice . It 's both safe for an actor to have on underwater . We 're always gonna miss this motorcycle. though . - l think it was in the script . - Yeah. it was . that the studio just could not get their head around . And we were like . " We don 't know. but it 's cool . " And it was weirdly a huge argument point that became this thing . And evey time I see it. I go . " God. that three-wheel was cool . " But lust to make a motorcycle that has the Cobra symbol on it . I love that idea you had about - The charge bar . - Yeah. the charge bar . Interestingly enough. I think Firefly . and didn 't have in the script . There was lust something about the way they rendered him . and then his opening lines with Cobra . Ray really embodied a great version of that character. too . And at first I was a little bit like . " lt 'll be interesting to see how this develops . " about how Firefly saw things exploding as creation. not destruction . and that redistributing energy was art . And so we went with it . This sequence is amazing. because right from the beginning right here " he 's gonna pull him upside down . which is already an odd thing . And suddenly he 's right side up . And what 's great about having him as Storm Shadow . But he 's also this incredible physical specimen . And there was a huge difference between making the first movie with him he was lust beginning to learn English . They didn 't lust come from a natural place . was lust sort of in the vey first scene . when you were shooting him. I was like . And because he owned the language . you know ? and not the least of which look how built he is . His dedication to learning English really helped us . Bringing the rage into Storm Shadow . He wanted a little more craziness . which was nice to have . That sense of betrayal is like . - You 'd get increasingly crazy about it . - Yeah . That road is literally ... We created it . And then do this rig where he lumps off of the ramp . You cannot do a big ... You have to be going e _ remely fast . Which was scripted. actually . Those explosions are real . We don 't CG those explosions . Which I think was a big aesthetic change we wanted to do in this movie power of the explosions. the debris . the water. all sorts of environments . That this was happening in real life . We had switched actors playing this character . and yet this moment . on a physical level . Luke Bracey . who plays Cobra Commander . You can see his stature . the way he walks . which is really. really cool . And the voice . Robert Baker . who does the voice . We got to add this sort of hissing . breathing thing . and he 's always e _ ending his S 's . So we went with more of this breathing mechanism. it had this rattle . and what he 's saying . So you 'll hear it throughout the movie Yeah. I think also . the trick was also not to be Darth Vader . That was always the hardest thing . Gets you there first . - lt took up a big area of that space . - Yup . And his iacket . His iacket is so insane . It 's like bedazzled ... And that scar on his head . that was an idea that Ray brought . And the idea of it was it was an explosion gone bad. right ? It did. it gave the character ... We immediately saw it . This was a big debate . It 's pretty bad-looking . You gotta get him to the healer . And. of course . Snake Eyes ' vision through there was really fun . All the reticules became really fun to design . I think one of the amazing things . actually. about that conversion was . both Jon and I had gone through experiences with 3-D . we were so. so focused on . " How do we do this the right way ? " in terms of how you saw it . in terms of how Steve Windon shot the movie . So the conversion process. I think . had less pressure on it . This is a gigantic space we 're shooting in . I think one of the real triumphs for us . I know I feel that way. is that The 3-D is incredibly appreciated . Yup . was when Paramount called us and said . It was . " Whoa ! Really ? Why ? That 's all the things you go through in your head right away . " we actually think there 's bigger upside if we go to 3-D . " after having the moment of emotional recovey of . Now we 're like . " Okay. stop . " You know. when a studio wants to spend more money on a movie . And as it 's turned out . it was a great move . I think if we didn 't have those moments . it wouldn 't have been a choice for us . But because there 's just so many moments ... where we 're pushing through the satellite . And stuff like this in 3-D is beautiful and gorgeous . All these things . the language is already in there . Elodie Yung is amazing . Yeah . Well. the hardest thing. I think . when you make . is the audience is vey tough on female action characters . And Elodie in Distr9ct 13 : Ultimatum , wasn 't that what it was called ? she 's got the grace of being a beautiful woman . and then this ferocity in her is really crazy good . She really brought it to life. the feeling of wanting to be part of something . I mean. she learnt those swords from the ground up . I mean. evey time you see an actor actually learn it and do it . It 's more believable . There 's an organic nature to it . But we knew his love of kung fu and the lore of it . he was lust for us sort of a special treat . lust mess with your expectations of these characters . But going from there to here . to the streets of Washington . D.C .. It 's really fun . is both incredibly liberating . and. actually. really. really dangerous . and keep it moving in the same direction. you know ? Miley Cyrus and Ryan Seacrest . that 's such a fine line . And I think it was actually important that it does fit into our world . It 's also one of those things where you go to that first preview . if they don 't laugh at that it 's coming out of the movie . I always wanted a scene here where at the end of the movie . and it 's lust destroyed . 'Cause the reality is they get a car from him and they just destroy it . He lust came in . he riffed a lot of the stuff . And it 's all gotta establish . really . Roadblock 's backstoy Why this place would these guys choose to hide ? That one line . " Home is where the help is . " That 's it . That he 's coming back to his origins to build up again . no tons of weapons . just back to where he started . make up the stuff that they figure out all the DNA things from later . you could see that Roadblock grew up in this place . I love those little trophies back there . - lt 's such a sort of sports feeling . - Yeah . in those frames. which is cool . Yup. yup . That thing 's so fun to lump in . and this tension that exists between Flint and Roadblock of . " l got my own set of ... " And he 's really on program . but at the same time . You know. he can 't sort of help it . especially from the new guy Flint . 'cause he 's not there yet . and that they can debate that . We don 't get fully into it . but we get to play just a little bit . what would convince somebody that a guy was an imposter . 'Cause people do cross their thumbs . as you 'll see him shortly . and they always do that move Yeah. and if you ty it . you feel like one way feels natural . Even if you do it both ways . one of them feels more natural . You forget how simple it is . to create the Ul for a computer system in any scene . Like . " How high-tech do they have it ? What era we are in . And going through even lust the sound . lust because we wanted to give them a little edge to it . Things that you 'd never think ... This was a tricky moment. you know ? that these guys can leap to this conclusion ? It 's actually set up in the desert . " l voted for him " you know . so how long can you actually draw it out before you 're like . " Come on. guys . " the introduction of his character . is a really interesting thing . at first blush. the idea that he 's gonna call her by her wrong name . You know. that was really Bruce 's idea . that was not a scripted idea . and even this. sort of . Girl Scout reference here And it 's one of the things. I think . you realise why they 're movie stars . and they know what they do well. too . " Shut your mouth . Brenda " is so rough . " How are women gonna feel about this ? " And I remember Adrianne . It started at the dinner. yeah . But it was funny. because it started to get under her nerves . I think I got it about halfway out of my mouth . It only works for Bruce . Bruce even brought this up. he 's like . " At some point she needs to punch me . " 'Cause it would 've happened at the end . when they 're attacking the President . But I always ... You do . You want her to punch him at some point . with what could be a vey unsympathetic thing Yes . That 's the power of Bruce . that Jon and I talked a lot about this character . Joe Colton . is the embodiment of the original G.l. Joe ethos. if you would . And that 's the Joe I grew up with . Single character. not a fantasy . not all that stuff. the guy . it was actually one of the easiest pitches I 've ever had . And I turned to him . and I called him up and said . He goes . " l get to play the original Joe ? " Putting firecrackers on my Joe . and throwing him off the roof . " And so it was this kind of funny moment . is now in this movie . we succeeded in the first movie of doing . that we could bring that to this table . Which is pretty awesome . 'cause it has ... So when they 're all in the same room . it 's the only person ... Roadblock in the face. and say . " You don 't need a tank. and a laser ... Laser guns to be a soldier . And I thought that was the important part for our team . 'Cause I remember looking at the crew members " We 're professionals doing our iobs . Yes . Yes. there were . That was a vey popular day . There might have been . She 'll give it right back at you . She 's like . " l need to get punched in this scene . " And she 's like . " Jon. I have to be as tough as eveyone else . And it made complete sense . So we never treated her differently in all this stuff . which also conveys that sense of toughness . And. actually. it 's one of the tricks I think that ... how you cary yourself conveys a lot about your physicality . We shot this in the ... Whistler area . I think it 's probably our most highly complimented sequence in the movie . they were fans of the comic book . I think it was originally two and a half pages . Something like that . So you won 't hear any conversation. anything . And we kept saying to ourselves . " Are we gonna get away with that ? We kept feeling like . " There 's always the out " We can always have him say something . I know you were a huge fan of the comic book . Yeah . And Issue 21 that Lary Hama did that had no dialogue in it Before that it was like . " lt 's just to sell toys . " And that 's what we really wanted to capture in the movie. too . and more of the comic book feel to it . At least some of the reality of it . the te _ ure . I always thought this was one of the coolest moments . There 's Cobra symbols carved into the ninja stars . No music. I remember we used to have big music here . - lt was cool to hear the silence . - Yeah . We lust tried it to hear and we were like . Just the fact that Snake Eyes lust punches through a column is awesome . Thank God Byung-Hun and Ray are such great athletes . So that 's the mother of one of our stunt guys . And so she 'd never been in a movie . I was lust drawn into her . 'cause she was so tough . And so called her up . said if she 'd ever come down . all those things are really her . She 'd never done a movie with her son . Travis Wong is the stunt guy . and he 's one of the Red Ninjas . And I loved that Jinx has that sort of Bruce Lee ninja outfit on . You can see it. even lust passing out here he 's so intense . It was scaring me when we were shooting . But he lust gives it all. sells it . was again a Reese and Wernick idea that then we had to figure out . This was such a huge team effort to our pre-viz guys. to our stunt guys . to George. who did our second unit ... lt was amazing . eveyone came together for this one . I don 't know. how many months went into this planning ? And this sequence wouldn 't work without Paul . How you would pendulum something . And being a stuntman. a rigger . a world-class climber . A lot of this sequence. you know ... That he had to rig up . which is really cool . - A thousand feet ? - Yeah . And . Paul. from the vey beginning ... he came to my office and we worked out We got out our ninia action figures from Hasbro and started planning it out . " so it doesn 't feel like we 're in a video game . " You know that this could actually happen . And for me . I 'd used him in a lot of movies . I knew we were in good hands to be able to execute it . I always loved this . - And I loved the posturing ... - The joust . The pause right here . it 's such a great idea . It was really one of the most dramatic things . It really conveyed a lot of attitude . And I was like . when they 're hanging on the side . and they pull out their swords . it 's so cool . There are real people with real weight . But these. you feel the weight . That guy. when he falls off the line is not real . - Yes . - Now it 's a real fake rock . then we had this gigantic green screen built in our facility - l don 't know. five weeks ? - A lot . I don 't know . probably in total this thing is At least . And we did great . as they 're swinging that fast . or getting things out of focus . There 's some really fun details that eveybody contributed to . Jim May and Roger Barton . who were our editors . We had to be done with this while we were shooting They had to figure it out . Especially Roger . When you shoot all these pieces . how does it all come together . And so that was really fun to see . I mean. he 's like the unofficial mayor . maybe it 's even official now . But there 's something about the political veracity of that There he is . He 's such a great face . I didn 't know how he would ... He was the most welcoming . he was like . He was literally like the mayor . to a city still recovering from Katrina meant a lot to the city . was he felt like . well. he could help us help the city . That dress was always a winner . That might have been the first dress she showed us . Right when you saw it . you couldn 't deny it . " Move on. another decision . " - She 's a fashion fan . - Yeah . 'cause then we could say . " No. you have to have that mask " And she would put up a fight . And then you would look at it . but in the way that it needed to be . She lust understood. she got it . lmmediately when I see her walking through. I think Matrix . I 'm sure that wasn 't Louise 's intention . Yes. and then there was no one else we wanted to put in red . - Let her stick out . - Yep . and they 're like dancing. all this stuff . Who was great. too. she was great . You really fall in love with certain things . and then the ne _ thing you know . At a certain point we needed the tension . - And the pacing . - Yeah . - As evey Joe should . - Of course. of course . To work with the graphics people to create how it scans . I also remember this moment . in comes something that 's a direct call back to ... But this moment with The Rock that 's about to come up . about . " Should we see the Firefly . should we not see the Firefly ? " this character wouldn 't react the way he reacts . We had a long debate about this . remember . Jon ? At one point he was doing it . He 'd gone rogue from the others . And so there was a lot of debate " What. strategically . are they tying to do ? " that the G.l. Joes had to assassinate the fake President . So this moment would be that moment. you 're like . But eventually it became that you wanted Roadblock to be in control . You wanted it to be well thought out . But it 's brutal. because the hard thing is And it was one of the things we kept saying to ourselves . " and actually make it believable ? " - Yes . - And a great actor . It was one of those great things that all came together . but he was physically so daunting that we wanted this moment . and how some of the great action stars have understood And that 's a tricky thing . " can you really let a hero like Dwayne get beaten ? " is that now it 's the rematch . I always imagined that was the three-wheeled motorcycle going away . Yeah. that would 've been fun . and we were intrigued by One which is a sort of ninia stoy . This is about past histoy that has nothing to do with Dwayne 's character . This is a totally different stoy that 's going on . that we 're tying to juggle these stoylines . But when you have someone like Byung-Hun Lee here . it doesn 't matter where you are . what you 're doing . And you get into him. and you feel that it 's a guy struggling with - you 're immediately back in this . - Yeah . helped a lot with going back and forth . Especially falling off cliffs . Why not ? Why not ? It 's actually something we didn 't talk about . So she 's really. in her life. has had to of being the cousin of a traitor in their minds . The Blind Master 's friend was killed . And eveybody 's got some grudge in this scene . I don 't know if you knew this . but we were literally ... they had casted. not little people . but really small ninjas . " We 've gotta find bigger . more warrior-like ninjas . " " Are you guys crazy how big you 've made this thing ? " Boy. you better make a good thing out of this set . " I think one of the interesting things about making movies is . And so many decisions get made so fast keep track of all the decisions . Picking the right people to make the right decisions is incredibly complex . I remember lust looking at the production designer . Andrew . " You built this big ... How much does this set cost ? " " We 're gonna need money for the tank battle . " Well . Jon loves the big ninias scene . " - We need all of it . - Right . - The TV became the most ... - Right . this moment that dad does not take . and that her motivation is to get him to salute to her . There 's a lot of hostility and anger in that. you know . - Yeah . - That he salutes her at the end . To me. it makes their relationship make all the sense in the world . and I guess we 'll get there . we 'll talk about it . When he said . " l knew your dad " you were like . " Whoa . " - He didn 't even have to go there . - Didn 't have to do anything . He got it . This was a matter of saving some time . before it was getting boring . and said what if you are the President and look right at the camera . We 'd done a little bit of that with the Cobra vision . So we tried to find fun ways to make it interesting . I always loved Jonathan 's look on his face . And the reflection in Cobra 's mask is hard . That should be the camera . So whenever you see his mask you won 't see the camera . We had a lot of debate about this briefcase. remember ? I remember looking at it going . " What is this ? What is this leather ? " But we were like . " That 's what a real nuclear football looks like . " - lt 's true . - And we started tearing stuff off of it . - what 's the right look for the football . - Yeah . and yet instantaneously recognisable for the audience ? If you don 't understand . you haven 't seen an action movie This was hard . because it was really dark . You wanted this rawness to it . Always got a big laugh. that moment . Yeah. I think it was when they added the sound effect of the gun . 'Cause you don 't necessarily look down there . He had a ton of things that he kept saying that were hilarious . And this was always hard to ... At what point ... they have mutual interest in this one battle . I remember the arguments ... Not the arguments. but. really. like . - Really quickly . - So that 's all in pe _ ormance . Now we enter this scene . I remember we were in New Orleans right before you make a movie . And I turned to the writers and I said . 'Cause I knew whatever it was . it couldn 't be too expensive . Right ? And they literally wrote in the script . they put . And then our editor . when he got the dailies . He read it and he was like . " Okay. what song do they mean ? " to find the most obscure song that they think we mean . I remember when I walked in and I saw ... And I looked at you like . " You guys actually used The Four Horsemen . " You should 've seen my face when I walked in . But it was so funny that we had to show you . I don 't know. self-conscious . or tying to be cool . - " We 're tying to have fun . " - Yes . 'cause it 's almost so obscure that you 're like . And it 's probably Joe Colton . although , Rockin ' Is Ma ' Business _ cause business is good . - Nice . - We tried it . - l think we tried it . That was actually And we would sometimes bring a boom box out with us . That 's how I got turned on to them . that I couldn 't believe I was doing a G.l. Joe movie . Byung-Hun Lee . Ray Park . Adrianne . D.J .. all these guys ... Elodie. these characters around a table . it was just insane . 'Cause we 've seen a lot of these scenes . And each of them to have something to do . Each one. like . " What 's that character ? Yeah. yeah . I never understood why nobody laughed when he said " Rock solid . " Yes . Don 't know if we 're actually making a reference to The Rock or not . I always loved this moment. too . I remember. I think that was your ... I don 't know whose idea it was . - And he 's like . " Nope . " - " Not gonna help you there . " But it also throws her as a character or slightly. at least at a minimum. edgy . has suddenly ... The tanks and the fan boat . rebuilt it to make it a Cobra boat . because it weighed too much . remember ? No. it sank . So we tied the car that our crane was on to pull it out . So we have to cut the cord . and to let it sink . - lt knocked over our car . - Yeah . But those H.l.S.S. Tanks are really about your passion . And so I 'm like . " H.l.S.S. Tanks ? Why is that so cool ? " " All right. I get it . They turn into a Cobra . " So then we turned it into a tank battle . And to actually have a tank live there that was 30 . 20 feet high . It was crazy . We got a tank somewhere . I don 't know where we got a tank from . and built it in the H.l.S.S. Tank way . and you could fire it in the warehouse . This sequence was actually originally scripted And we didn 't have the money to do it . that even remotely looked like it in New Orleans lt 's actually one of the things that was so hard . And we came up with this idea of Fort Sumter being a symbol of war . when the guy 's gonna talk about disarmament . " we can actually do this ending here in New Orleans " gave us enough sense of grounding and sense of purpose about it I think I 'll always miss the UN a little bit . a sort of Dr. Strangeloye-esque feel to it . so they could use them throughout the battle . be in histoy and have. you know . or shadows of the soldiers from past wars above these guys . Yes . Hary Humphries . who was our militay advisor He was part of the Joe Colton old-guy crew . Old-school. I 'm an old guy . I can say that . I guess we lust put a sticker on that thing. if it 's from a different county . I think it 's almost the biggest laugh in the whole movie . I 'm gonna put _ ngy Birds in evey one of my movies . This was always a controversial and crazy idea . I remember when the studio first read it . and Hasbro . " You 're gonna launch evey nuclear weapon in the world ? " " This is cool. this is diabolically insane . twisted logic . I remember when I read it for the first time I was like . " What ? How do you get out of this one ? " It was one of those ones. where when you first read it. you were like . We have so much cool footage we couldn 't put in . - Especially of Elodie. I always miss that . - Yeah . And this ioke we used. I don 't know . how many times in marketing . I had no idea it was gonna work like that . His pe _ ormance. her pe _ ormance together are amazing . He 's like . " You gotta use my car . it 's awesome . " To have Joe Colton do that car . the El Camino . - lt was so much fun watching him do it . - Yes . is how do you cast a President that 's credible as a President ? So it 's vey difficult. it 's tricky . So when you ty to cast the President of the United States . And Jonathan gave it such a level of credibility and gravity . that he held in that thing. you know ? It used to be seeing lust dots go along . But it really didn 't . when we came down to it . And this is. again . one of these things where . 'cause they 're nuts . And he 's nuts . Yeah . was those threats started right about when we were releasing . That 's serious stuff . " Okay. which city are we going to blow up ? " gone through evey single thing . And so. I think we all sat down . we were like . " Let 's do London . It 's one of the most incredible shots ILM did. though . An amazing company . but that shot is just something else . you could pause that on any frame and you can see how detailed ... Yeah. it 's crazy . and lust stare at that box for the whole shot So it was intense . It was interesting. it was definitely a struggle for us. is that . the handing off of leadership . when you 're establishing the movie . And it took a lot of massaging for us to figure that out . Look at this shot. it 's crazy . Those buildings ... I lust went to London to premiere our movie there . " l know what we did with this window . " It was pretty cool . I love these shots . It 's lust so fun to see . We had actually more shots of them taking over the Capitol . The Supreme Court Justice . rounding them up . - ln one shot. it said eveything . - Yeah . We were like . how fast should they fall. and ... - Who 's releasing them ? - Who 's releasing them ? Yeah . - l remember that debate . - Yeah . It 's one of the things that 's so interesting in filmmaking is . that can tell a lot of stoy in a really short period of time ? the rounding up the Supreme Court Justices . " l got it . This is bad . " - This thing. the Ripsaw tank . - Ripsaw. yeah . Of course Dwayne has to have it battling these three giant H.l.S.S. Tanks . It drives through houses . So it 's fun to play around with that thing . It was fun to stage that . and it was complicated to do that . 'cause we had this real thing . Those are real H.l.S.S. Tanks to a point . you have to create some of it . - l love that one . - Love that ... I think that was your idea . And even the sound. having it go out . But. again. that 's another one of those combo things. from our stunt guys . to DD. who did the tanks . all those things . Yes . Who would 've thought ? I always loved them . The yin and the yang coming together in a swirl . It says eveything about who they are . " Nope. I 'm on your team . " Steve Windon. who is our DP . That 's what I love about Steve Windon . but also iconic moments . in the most comic book character way . Yeah. I think it 's one of the hardest things to do in these big movies . How do you keep that 5 ' 10 " . 6-foot creature called humans Both of us. when we saw fast flye , The dynamism of it. and yet you never lost sense of the characters . And when we were debating about which DP . that you and I both gravitated towards . Yeah . the fight with the President and the Red Ninja . But it lust became a distraction from getting the actual suitcase throughout . I love seeing Bruce fight here . That was a big moment . Bruce Willis walking on the set. huh ? I was nervous. but he was great . and you look at the monitor. I forgot that it was a movie that I was making . It 's funny . ' cause when you 're working on these stunt action beats . That 's Steve Ritzi. actually . our stunt coordinator . And sometimes it comes from him . sometimes it comes from Jon . It comes from all different people . It was such an interestingly choreographed ... to distract the audience . I remember when Ritzi first pitched it to us . That 's kind of cool . nobody 's seen that in so long . " What way have you never entered a scene before ? " 'Cause he could say . " l did that. I did that. I did this . " 'cause he knew evey single one . I remember him pointing to his shoulder . or something crazy . And. again . Byung-Hun Lee giving a great pe _ ormance here . But you feel for a ninia. which is cool . I remember this debate . Remember this debate ? - But it 's so cool . - lt 's pretty awesome . And I think that was something that ... It was actually ... He was like . " What if we just cut it in half ? " Again. it 's so hard to tell if you 're going over the top or not with a movie like this . as we were sort of going and seeing cuts put together . but you have to ground it . all at the same time . I 'm so glad that came into the movie . That was gone for a while . And that helicopter ... Oh. my gosh . That thing is awesome . Does that mean Cobra 's in the ne _ movie ? You never know . You never know . Maybe Duke 'll be alive . This whole fort was really crazy . With crocodiles in the moats that we had to be careful of . And this moment. I love it . to finally get onto the tank and just fire that gun . - and misses the other guy . - Misses the other guy . - He 'll get it . - Exactly . how many times were we like . We had to find vey strategic places that never bumped you One of the good things about working with Dwayne. he 's so up for anything . He 's always prepared. totally on it . So we had to like do a lot of tricks to make it look fast . then we built them. and we were like . " These move really slowly . - You remember that ? - Yeah . I remember thinking how cool fan boats were I always wanted to do a fan boat from that . I can 't remember . Yeah. this is the big showdown . Again. to me it was like always e _ ended brass knuckles . We went back and forth with . " How realistic is this ? " but that they 're actually attacking . So it didn 't seem like ... ThanMully . Ray and Dwayne are so game . Look at how hardcore they 're going at it . I was always like . " l don 't know. man . how many bullets can go off here ? " Yeah. we did at one point . But I love at the end here . he 's out of bullets . Sees that suitcase . Again. it was so hot here . the flies were out . because you lust see these bugs flying eve _ here . It was so disgusting . It was pretty disgusting . and how were we gonna make sure the audience is gonna react . I think we had so many characters . it was always a puzzle But this moment here ... Actually. this was a Ritzi moment. too . " He should lust walk away and press the button . It 's one of those classic moments . It 's funny when you re-watch this scene . And we were talking about it . then you go back and look at it - That one we always really relished . - Yes . Sometimes those moments are tricky . the balance . I always love how uncompromising it is here You know. it 's not the way you normally play in a movie like this . - He is so not over his grudge . - Yeah . That has to keep going . Plus. there 's room to milk it . G.l. Joes . I love these kids . Yeah. I think that there was a moment of attaching that . the head of the studio . who had this idea of . It 's good to see the President . Here we are supposedly at the edge of Arlington National . - Again . - Again . Yeah. and the Washington Monument back there . It 's funny. even in the script it made you get tears in your eyes . - He lust ... - He killed it . And you lust feel that . he really understood this dynamic in a way that we couldn 't understand it . Even at the moment . I didn 't quite get that . and see what he 's doing underneath it all . They 're all Joes now . I always thought this was fun. too . Two generations of stars . The respect they have for each other is huge . to see them together again would be amazing . Boom . with this way of lust reminding us of the adventure . And How You Like Me Now ? , it 's just that song is just pe _ ect for it . We never mentioned Hasbro either . What 's great about working with them is And they were always constantly coming to us with new ideas about . That whole part of the sequence we had to cut out . That was crazy . Yeah. go . Jinx . And Heny did a great iob doing the music . and things that he found really well . - Love that move . - Yeah . That 's a great character introduction . I gotta say . She 's really such a delight to work with. too . and evey single person brought their own thing . It lust felt like you could attach yourself to any of them I could hang out with all those guys and girls at a bar and be cool . You want somebody for each person to relate to. you know ? simply because they 're more possible for who you are . - Way to go. buddy . Way to go . - Good job to you. too . - That 's an awesome logo right there . - Designed by Steven Soderbergh . - ls that true ? Wow . - Yeah . I had a clause in my contract that And he 's like . " l don 't like logos on my movie . " He goes . " Because I don 't like the logos . " And there was this long silence . and he goes . " Are you serious ? " - And that 's the logo . - Nice. nice . and he goes . " l guess you really did like it. huh ? " - He didn 't see it in 3-D . - That 's what he 's gotta see . The movie is still in theatres .

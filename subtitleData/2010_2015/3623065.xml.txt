 It 's found its proper home . It can bring people to you , like a siren 's song . Compass ? That seems to be the key component in the mystery , enough for them to kill for . He 's gonna tell me everything he knows about the carnival . We could isolate Samuel here . The problem , of course , is finding it . But our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . First , you have to disappear for eight more weeks . Well , then we 'll have to agree to disagree , Hiro . The craziness over the last few weeks is finally over . [ sighs ] Sylar 's gone . Who is she ? Vanessa . The love of my life . Have you seen her around here ? She 's out there . I 'm afraid she 'll reject me for who I am , for what I 've done . You 're still her father . You 're the only one she has left and she needs you . You know , the thing about burnt bridges is they can be rebuilt . Look at her . How do I explain to her about the world without dampening her spirits ? Now she sees it filled with promise and hope , as bright as the light in her eyes . But I 've lived long enough to know that everything is not as it appears . Evil does exist . People do terrible things to one another . Oh , god . Oh ! Oh ! Oh , my god ! Noah ? Noah ? Oh , my god . I 'm still your brother . [ Grunts ] How do I protect her without losing her ? Hasn 't your father lied , cheated , even killed , to protect you ? How do I build a bridge between us ... You lied to me . We shouldn 't have done it . ... When the distance seems so vast ? I need time to grieve without being reminded why . [ Sighs ] So much for his eighth grade class . Who 's next ? We 're getting down to childhood playmates , Noah . If that 's what it takes . All I 'm saying is , are you sure this is a productive use of our time ? Yes . I 've got to find this guy , Lauren . And I want to help you , but we 've been shooting in the dark for , like , six hours now . You got a better idea , I 'm all ears . It 's just that you 're starting to sound a little ... Obsessed ? You could call Claire . Not an option . She has a compass , Noah . She can lead us right to the- - I am not calling Claire . She 's angry at me right now , and frankly , she has every reason to be . She 's in no mood to help her old man . Well , maybe it 's time to patch things up . Maybe it 's time we found a useful lead . If you don 't want to help me , you don 't have to . I 'm--I 'm ... We got a hit on Vanessa Wheeler . Who ? She 's the one that I told you about . She grew up in the estate where his parents worked . The house that became a sinkhole . Looks like we have some still photos off a security camera . Is that your man ? That 's him . You got a phone number ? California area code . [ Phone dialing ] Hello ? Vanessa Wheeler ? Yes ? Who 's calling ? My name is Bennet . Noah Bennet . I wanted to talk to you about Samuel Sullivan . What 's this about ? Just looking for him , and I 'm wondering if you 've heard from him lately . I 'm sorry . I don 't know anybody by that name . Really ? Because he grew up on the estate that your family owned . [ Click and dial tone ] Looks like I 'm going to California . Yeah . Good luck with that . Lauren . Good night . [ Door closes ] Lydia . Just writing a letter . Anybody I know ? I 'm running low on ink supplies . If you 're going into town tomorrow , I need you to pick some things up . Of course . Lydia . I know much has happened lately that 's difficult . Edgar . Hiro . Claire Bennet . Joseph . Not to mention Sylar . I 'm asking for your patience . I need you on my side . We 're so close now to realizing all our dreams . Our dreams , Samuel ? Or are they yours ? I made a list . Indigo . Umber . Linseed oil . - She 's beautiful . - Don 't worry . You 'll meet her soon enough . I 've waited a long , long time to bring her . The day has finally come . You don 't trust him , do you ? He 's planning something big , and I don 't like it . He 's always been good to me . I don 't know why you want to cause trouble . If this family is going to survive , we are going to need a new leader . Like who ? There is someone . A man of compassion . Samuel himself said that he may be the next Joseph . He 's just so far away . Well , maybe you can call him . Maybe I can . [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] Hmm . Ah . Is Matty still asleep ? - Yeah . He was up so late watching Ratatouille . - Speaking of which ... - Hmm ? Tonight , for dinner- - ratatouille . - Really ? - Yeah . I 'm looking at it . I mean , it 's really not that hard . Huh . You know , my brother called yesterday . He 's still looking to hire someone . You don 't know of anyone , do you ? Uh , no . I mean , I told you before , I don 't know any software salesmen . You see , he doesn 't need a computer guy . Just someone who 's smart , focused and , you know , looking to get ahead . You don 't like my cooking ? Matt , I love your cooking , but you want me to work for your brother . Seriously ? Honey , your brother ? I 'm just worried about you . Since you got back , you hardly leave the house . - Well , I 'm a stay-at-home dad guy . That 's what I do . What 's wrong with that ? Nothing . I just want you to be happy . There 's " stay at home because you want to , " and then there 's " stay at home because you 're scared not to , " and I just don 't know which one you are . I 'm the one who is really excited about this ratatouille recipe , which , by the way , will be ready at 6 : 30 p.m. sharp . Honey , I 'm really happy . I am , just being here , taking care of you and Matty . Okay . Have a good day . Go make some money , will you ? Hello , Matt . [ Exhales sharply ] Bennet ! I thought I 'd check your security system . Seems you 're not as safe as you think . Okay . I 've left you five messages . What do you want , Bennet ? I need your help . Have you ever heard of a guy named Samuel Sullivan ? No , but even if I have , the last time I helped you , I got Sylar stuck in my head and I almost died , you remember that ? It 's nasty out there , Matt , but shoving your head in the sand doesn 't make the world go away . Yeah . Well , you never know until you try , do you ? I 'm sorry about what you 've been through . The Sylar thing was a terrible idea . We all admit that . Look , I stay home and lock my doors . I don 't see why that has to change . Because this Sullivan guy , he 's a very bad man . Well , so is Bin Laden . So you 're gonna have to do better than that . He 's trying to recruit my daughter . [ Sighs ] Okay , what 's your plan ? Are you gonna go kick this guy in the teeth instead of talking to your daughter ? I 'm sorry . Today it 's Claire . Tomorrow , it could be your son . - All right , time to kiss bye-bye . Patients only past the double doors . Can 't I at least see him to his room , make sure he 's comfortable ? [ Chuckles ] Comfortable . Come on , pal . Let 's get you strapped in . - What ? - Just an expression . Hiro ? Ahmadi ? Dr. Watson is Suresh ! How long are these rehearsals anyway ? I have no idea . Okay , so she plays the cello , she 's in the L.A. Chamber Orchestra , and she 's first chair . What is she , Samuel 's girlfriend or something ? Well , that 's what you 're here for , Matt . That 's her , right there . Yep . Looks like rehearsal 's over . Jump in anytime . What ? No , no , no . Hey , I never- - - Vanessa Wheeler ? - Do I know you ? I 'm Noah Bennet . We spoke on the phone briefly . I called you about Samuel Sullivan . I thought I was clear . I told you , I don 't know him . Yeah , the problem is that we know that you do because we have pictures of the two of you . Are you with the police ? No . It 's more complicated than that . Is there somewhere that we could go and sit down and talk for a minute ? Look , whoever you are , just , please leave me alone . Hang on just a second . Have you met my friend Matt Parkman ? No ! And I don 't want to ! Matt , you want to share any thoughts here , please ? No , I told you I- - [ sighs ] You can trust us , Vanessa . You want to talk to us . You know , come to think of it , I 'm glad you called . I need to talk to someone . I 'm worried about him . Hey , Noah , it 's Peter . Look , that , uh- - that tattoo on my arm , it showed up again . Give me a call , all right ? Bye . Yes ! Emma ? It worked ! I 'm sorry . What worked ? I brought you here with music . I just had to think of you , and it worked . I 'm sorry . Please , come in . I met an unusual man , and he showed me a new side to my ability , using this . Where did you get this cello ? That same man . He 's the one who sent it to me . Who ? What 's his name ? Samuel . Why ? I woke up this morning with this . They were good years , growing up . He used to write me these poems , these little love poems . We were close . Neither of us cared that his family lived in the carriage house on my family 's property or that his father called my father " sir . " One day I came home and they were gone . I moved on with my life . I assumed he moved on with his . But he hadn 't . He showed up in my room one night , all swagger and rock and roll . I was just in the right place for the bad boyfriend . We had a wild couple of weeks , till he asked me to marry him and run off to his carnival . I mean , a carnival ? I was getting a music degree at Yale . Vanessa , he 's not that 20-year-old kid anymore . Samuel Sullivan is a very dangerous man . Well , lately he has been showing up more and more often . Since his brother died , it 's gotten even worse . He just shows up , spouting all kinds of crazy things . Okay . So he 's stalking you ? That 's not the word I would choose , but he does seem- - Obsessed ? A week ago , he was waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building . Going on and on about how much he misses me , how we 'll be together once I see how powerful he 's become . It was 2 : 00 in the morning . So he knows where you live and you know how to reach him ? I 've been banging my head against the wall , trying to figure out how to find the carnival . Maybe we bring the carnival to us . Okay . How do you move a carnival ? Do us a favor . Call him . Is this the guy that gave you the cello ? Who said his name was Samuel ? Yes . You know him ? He told me his name was William Hooper . What did he want from you ? He didn 't want anything . Just to find a homeless man . That 's it ? Yes . He gave me something . This . Emma , the last time I saw a compass like this , my friend got stabbed . You think Samuel- - If there 's any connection to that , I 'd keep my distance from him . Peter , he 's a good man . Emma , my friend almost died because of a compass just like that . And he wasn 't the first person that got attacked . [ Knock on door ] Delmonico 's for lunch . Or maybe it 'll be too crowded . How about Moxie ? Hi , mom . Um , Emma , this is my mother , Angela . - Nice to meet you . - Mom , this is Emma . Peter , how do you know this woman ? Emma is my friend . I need to get to work . Bye , Peter . I 'll call you later . What the hell was that ? - How 's it going ? - All good . You better not be messing with my meds . No , I was just admiring your cart . [ Knocks ] Very nice . I work in a cart factory . You 're the Japanese guy 's friend . Uh , yes . I 'm Buck . [ Sneezes ] [ Coughs ] Excuse me . I 'm Chuck . Yeah . Well , take it easy . He 's late . We 're pretty exposed here , Noah . So when he shows , we 've got to hustle . Taser and some duct tape and we 're out in 60 seconds . You getting a hit on the chip in her pocket ? Yeah , it 's all good . We have our target . What ? Well , he didn 't come past me . He must have come around the back . And let 's go . Copy that . [ Grunts ] Hello , Bennet . [ Zapping ] Hey , can I ask you a question ? No , uh ... [ Zapping ] Hey , what was that ? The alley . Get the car ! Got it . [ Groans ] Samuel Sullivan ! Where is she ? Stay away from her , Bennet . Where is she ? She 's already gone . What the hell happened to you ? [ Panting ] All right , she 's headed south on Normandie . Let 's go . [ Tires squealing ] You had a dream . There 's nothing you can do to save her . You need to save yourself . I 'm sorry . Mom , half this family is dead . Their bodies are surrounded with lies . It 's down to you and me . Are we ever gonna get this right ? Please , just tell me the truth . For once in your life , mom , please . The dream was foggy . The message was not . She 's gonna help kill people . That 's wrong . Mom , that 's not possible , okay ? She 's a good person . Peter , she 's gonna kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . A cello . Something to do with a cello . Tell me exactly what you saw . I told you , it doesn 't matter . The important thing is that you cannot save her . But someone else can . Is that it ? I 'm sorry . I need to know . People think that dreaming the future is a gift . They 're wrong . [ Pounding on door ] Dr. Watson ! [ Pounding on door ] Dr. Watson ! [ Swallows ] Hiro ? Hulk ! [ Growls ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] Dr. Watson , I have traveled over great oceans to free you ! Where am I ? You put me here ! To be continued . [ Gasps ] Beware the stormtroopers ! Why are you talking like that , Hiro ? Warp speed , Dr. Watson . We must rescue Sancho and escape . Sancho ? The prisoners have all gone to dinner . I 've hidden Sancho for his safety . Ando ? What 's happened to him ? He partook of the absinthe intended for you , Dr. Watson . Perfect . One who can 't walk , one who can 't talk . Whoo ! [ Alarm buzzes ] They must have searched my cell . We 've got to go . We shall ride to freedom . What 's happening ? [ Alarm buzzing continues ] It 's like swimming but inside out . i - Silencio ! I 'm swimming ! Shh ! Warp speed , captain ! Hey ! Get back in your cages ! Stormtroopers ! There they are ! It 's okay . I 've got this . [ Loud bangs ] What the- - ? [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] She 's here . She 's right here ! The carnival was here . Yeah ? Well , it isn 't here now . They had , like , a two-minute lead on us . An entire carnival doesn 't just disappear . This one does . Well , how did Claire find it ? Gotta have a compass . Okay , so you 're saying she got that from the Samuel guy ? No . She got it from me . Great . Okay , well , then let 's go back to Claire then . It 's not gonna work that way . You 're burning bridges , Noah . You can 't talk to Claire anymore , so tell me , how is it gonna work then ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . But we 're gonna find it . Somehow . We have to . Lauren , it 's me . Just call me . I 'm running out of ideas here . Well , you know what ? I would love to sit and brainstorm with you , I really would . But I 've got to make dinner . Dinner ? - Yeah . Ratatouille . - What ? Ratatouille . It 's French . It 's in the book . I know what ratatouille is . This woman 's been kidnapped . Well , that 's a missing persons case . And we have to find her . I don 't have a badge anymore . Let the cops handle it . You 're gonna send cops up against specials ? They 're gonna get flayed alive . Look , I dragged her into this . I pulled her into the sunlight . Well , maybe she 's already crossed state lines , Noah . Look , I mean , admit it . This is bigger than us . So what are you gonna do ? Are you just gonna lock your doors and crawl back into your shell ? You 're one of the good guys , Matt . You have a responsibility . You 're not a coward . You know , some days maybe you just can 't save the whole world . Some days , you 're better off just getting your own house in order . [ Chopping carrots ] Which means what ? Which means ... Go home . Hug your little girl . [ Chopping continues ] [ Whimpering and screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] Don 't worry . I 've come to save you . [ Gasps ] Hi . Aah ! What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . - What is wrong with you ? Let me explain . I have these dreams that come true , and I had one about you and that cello . You broke my cello because you had a dream ? No . Because a lot of people are gonna die , Emma . Your friend , Samuel . Uh , that compass that you have . My tattoo . They 're all connected to this cello . I loved that cello ! And we have to make sure to stop that dream from happening . That 's why I broke the cello , okay ? Something bad is going to happen . I want you out . Now ! I 'm sorry . I ... Good-bye , Peter . [ Crying ] Okay , I think that way is west . We must away , before the stormtroopers are upon us . I have had just about enough of your nonsense , Hiro . After what you did to me , I have half a mind to leave you lost in this swamp forever . Hey , don 't talk to him like that . Hiro has got very little time left , and he chose to spend it rescuing you . You should be thankful . He 's a hero . What do you mean , " little time " ? The reaper waits for no man . He 's dying . The stormtroopers and their Ewoks ! Hurry ! Are you sure he can 't teleport ? No . Not unless we unscramble his brain . Hey , what would they have done at that hospital ? Probably electroshock therapy . Hiro ! Why are we stopping ? Electroshock therapy . What , you want me to- - Even if we evade them , we could be wandering out here for days . We need to teleport out of here . How ? You can use your red lightning . Look , Hiro once saw a future where I killed him with my red lightning . Was it in Florida ? Japan . Then we 're good to go . Make it so , Sancho . Aah ! Hiro ! [ Groaning ] Ando . Dr. Suresh . We must stop Samuel Sullivan ! Hiro , you 're back ! Yes . And now , we must get going . [ Dogs barking ] Dad ? Hey , um , I 'm sorry to bother you . I was just in the neighborhood . Really ? Ye--no , no . I was in California . I just landed . Bags are still in the car . Listen , I know that you 're mad at me and--and I 'm okay with that . And , um , I want to just let you be mad at me . I don 't want to try to talk you out of anything or to try to convince you of anything . Dad , what are you doing here ? Are you all right ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm good . I 'm--I 'm great , actually . I 'm just--I 'm thinking about bridges . Bridges ? Bridges that connect us to the people and things that we love and need in our lives . They 're built on trust , and I 've- - I 've torched most of them . And I 'm just hoping that the- - that the one that connects me to you can still be repaired . I 'm sorry , but I do have something that I 'm late for . Oh , okay . Can we talk about this later ? Yeah , yeah . We 'll--we 'll- - We 'll talk about it later . This thing that you 're late for , do you need a lift ? No . No , I 'm good . Okay . So I 'll , uh , I 'll see you later ? Yeah . Um , I 'll see you later . I didn 't think a law office could be such a soap opera . I mean , the human drama of it all . Matt , you remember my boss , Pressman ? So he 's totally gay , he 's totally in denial , and he 's totally married . Okay . Mmm . Matt , this is delicious . Mmm ! So how about you ? Did you , uh , leave the house at all today ? Do you think I 'm a coward ? What ? I think I 'm a coward . What are you talking about ? Why ? I had the worst guy in the world living inside my head . When I finally got rid of him , I didn 't do a thing to go after him . Because you came home to us , where you belong . [ Sighs ] I 've let so many people down . Who ? [ Sighs ] Friends . Um , people that I care about . I mean , I 'm sitting here , eating ratatouille , Instead of facing the world , doing something about the problems that I 've caused . Matt , you have a family . Come on , you 're a simple guy . You care about us . That 's your world . You just have to let the rest of it be . There is nothing cowardly about looking after your family . You belong here with us . Okay ? Yeah . Come here . Not exactly five-star accommodations , I know , but if there 's anything you need ... What I need is to go home , Samuel . What are you doing ? You can 't just take me . [ Sighs ] I 've thought about this day for so long , Vanessa . The day you would arrive . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . Everything was supposed to be perfect . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Noah Bennet . He did a real number on you , didn 't he ? He got into your head . I had to act , to protect you , to get you away from him . By kidnapping me ? I would hardly say that . [ Scoffs ] You won 't let me leave here . You 've got me against my will . What would you call it ? You know what ? I 'm just- - You 're upset . And I understand why . [ Sighs ] But there is a reason for all of this . There 's something I want you to see . It 's so magical , so beautiful . Just let me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you right back to California , I promise . What do you mean , " right back to California , " Sam ? Where are we ? It 's so beautiful , Vanessa . Wait till you see it . It 's perfect . [ Knocking ] I was driving by . I saw the light on . Come on in . [ Sighs ] How was California ? Not as fruitful as I would have liked . You got my messages ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I know . And I think I , um ... I care for you more than I want to admit . And it 's complicated . I know . Just don 't do it again . Oh ! You have company . Sorry to pop in like this . Hello , boys .

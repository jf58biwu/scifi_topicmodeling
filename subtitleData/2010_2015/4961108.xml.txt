 This is serious , Rex . I 'm talking life or death stuff here . You 're talking table tennis . No ... oh no , not just table tennis , Rex . Championship table tennis . We could win the golden paddle . But my last three partners have been injured in matches against East Side High 's star player . Rex : What did they do ? Sprain their pinkies ? Noah : Their pinkies were the only things that didn 't get hurt . Rex : Okay , now I 'm interested . Noah : Awesome ! Two things , Rex ... first , if you decide to play , you 've got to enroll in school . [ Grunting , ball bouncing ] And second , in order to win the state championship , we 're gonna have to beat ... them . [ Both panting ] Both : Who 's next ? ! Rex : Huh ? Oh , I am so in . Noah : Yeah ! ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Noah : Okay , here 's your story . You 're a transfer student from Albuquerque ... Rex : Thanks , I ... Noah : Where you were Captain of the state-champion table-tennis team . I got you in all the easy classes except for one . The only math class open was Trig , which could be a problem . Rex : Actually , I ... Noah : You 've got to keep a passing average to play , so just attend all your classes and pray that there 's no pop quizzes for the week you 're gonna be here . You got all that ? Great . Here we are . Ready for some practice ? Put your hands in your pockets , keep your he down , and walk fast . Rex : What 's the shirt for ? [ Cheers and applause ] [ Women screaming ] Whoa ! Noah : Yeah . People around here take this game pretty seriously . Rex : I don 't get this much respect when I save the world . Noah : What can I say , man ? It 's table-tennis season . It 's a pleasure to have you on board , son . Heard great things about you . I , uh , do have some questions about your transcripts , though . Noah : Principal Rothberger . I , uh , tried calling this principal Haha from your previous school . Noah : He 's really good at the game , sir . Really ? Good enough to stand up to our problem at East Side ? Wrists look a little skinny . You got to have powerful wrists to get a good backspin . [ Cheers and applause ] Rex : 7,500 horses powerful enough for you ? Well , everything seems to be in order , son . [ Cheers and applause ] Noah : It 's just like regular tennis . You work with your partner , set up the shot , then ... Or you could just do that . [ Smooching ] [ Splash , squishing ] Anything for our champions . Rex : I can get used to this . Noah : [ Gasps ] Of course , if you don 't win the championship , you 're a dead man . Noah : No pressure or anything . That 's Mr. Buchiner 's Trig class . The guy 's love for triangles is a little unnatural . [ Gasps ] Mr. Nixon . So , this is the new table-tennis whiz . Well , Trigonometry may not get you the ladies the way that so-called sport does , but consider this ... Without Trigonometry , there would be no table tennis . Rex : Okay . Sure . Nice suit , by the way . Is he the sixth-deadliest teacher on the planet or something ? Noah : There are some pretty good players at the other schools ... Almost as good as me . [ Grunts ] It won 't be fair to use your evo powers on normal kids . Rex : But when we go up against the twins ... - Hyah ! - Game over . [ Sizzling ] Noah : Wow . Aah . [ Gasps ] Rex : Hey ! [ Panting ] Rex : Drop the weapon ! It 's not a weapon ! [ Whirring ] It 's a camera . [ Whirring ] Who are you working for ? East Side High . Please don 't kill me ! Rex : You 're a spy ? ! For table tennis ? ! Please don 't break it ! That 's my dad 's camera ! Rex : Get out of here ! We 've got nothing to hide . Noah : See you at the match Saturday . Bring your camera . Looks like you might have some actual competition , boys . [ Both growl ] [ Panting ] [ Bell rings ] [ Panting ] Rex : School 's actually a pretty cool deal . Home EC rocks ! I got a C-plus on my cake . Noah : Uh , that 's ... great . Rex : I get to hang around other kids , I 'm learning all sorts of interesting things , and there 's no evo monsters trying to pound my face into the ground . Noah : Glad you 're having such a good time , because your next class is no piece of cake . Hate to leave you to the wolves , buddy , but I 'm precalculous . The excitement of Trig was last semester for me . Rex : No problema . I perfected the art of pretending to be awake during all those boring Providence briefings . Noah : Just hope Buchiner doesn 't spring a ... [ Screech ! ] [ Screaming ] Pop quiz ? ! Pop quiz ? ! Pop quiz ? ! Pop quiz ? ! What ? ! What the devil is Buchiner thinking ? ! This could be a table-tennis killer ! Noah : We are so hosed . Any word ? How am I supposed to know the difference between a cotangent and a cosecant ? My brain hurts . Noah : We are so totally hosed . Rex : Hey , Noah . Whoa . What 's going on ? Noah : The quiz ? Rex : Oh , you know , it 's just Trig . Noah : Just Trig ? How did he do ? It seems in addition to table tennis , we have a Trigonometry prodigy in our midst . 98 % . [ All cheering ] Noah : You ? How ? Did your nanites help you ? Rex : It 's just trajectories and horizon lines , like aiming my slam cannon . Noah : All that matters is you passed . You 're still on the team ! It 's a beautiful day and one we 've all been waiting for , as the state championship table-tennis tournament gets under way . We 'll be covering every ball bounce and paddle smack of this exciting event , so get ready for some action . [ Crowd cheering ] Rex : All this for table tennis ? Noah : I know . Isn 't it great ? This is an elimination tournament , two tables at a time , winners move up in the ranks to the final showdown . Rex : You make it sound like the wild west . Noah : I think you 're finally getting it . Hey , found a new partner ? You 're next . Don 't mind the boys . They 're just a little enthusiastic . May the best ... team win . Noah : Those guys should get a trophy for good sportsmanship . Rex : Nothing I love more than putting a beatdown on a bully . This is going to be fun . Noah : Dude , save it for the final . [ Beep ] Rex : Huh ? This isn 't me . Something 's messing with my nanites . Noah : Rex , your hand . Rex : Duh , my hand . Noah : No , your other hand . Rex : You got to be kidding me . That sleazeball coach just tried to juice me . Nice try , buddy ! We 'll deal with him later . Let 's just focus on winning . [ Whistle blows ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Both growl ] [ Whistle blows ] Aah ! [ Growls ] [ Crowd cheering ] What are you doing ? ! Backhand ! Backhand ! You 're being too easy on them ! Go for the kill ! [ Crowd cheering ] Rex : Yeah ! Umpire , are you blind ? ! Ben Franklin fouled ! Match to the C-Notes . [ Whistle blows ] [ Crowd cheering ] Final match ... East Side evos versus Benjamin Franklin C-Notes . You 'll never beat those guys playing like that . Gabriel , you missed that drop shot . Michael , why didn 't you use a loop kill after the second service ? You boys going evo was the greatest gift to table tennis I 've ever seen . I hate watching you waste it . We didn 't ask for it . Gabe . What are you saying ? It ... it would just be nice to do normal things , you know , and have friends . Friends ? Table tennis is what you do , and you do it better than anyone else . When you 're a champion , nothing else matters . Yes , dad . When you inspire fear and respect , you don 't need friends . I promise I 'll do my best . Me too , dad . You better , boys . Now go out there and be a champion ... Or champions or whatever the heck you are . [ Both growl ] Noah : If you 're trying to psyche me out with your creepy double stink eye , you 're wasting your time . [ Cracking ] Okay , now , that creeps me out . [ Whistle blows ] Point ! Our point , loser . Noah : Oh , it is so on ! [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd boos ] [ Crowd boos ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Crowd boos ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Crowd boos ] Noah : [ Groans ] Rex : [ Groans ] [ Whistle blows ] Aw , did you break your paddle ? [ Both laugh ] Hope you brought a spare . Rex : As a matter of fact , I did . Aah ! Your serve ! [ Crowd cheering ] Hey , that 's not regulation . Noah : I think we threw out the rulebook a while ago . I 'll allow it . Play ball . [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Growls ] [ Crowd cheering ] Time to take home the gold . [ Beeping ] [ Both straining ] [ Both growl ] Rex : Whoa . Noah : Double whoa . What are you waiting for ? Serve the ball ! [ Growls ] [ Both growl ] Point to East Side High . Match point ! [ Both growl ] [ All gasp ] Rex : Guys , look what 's happening to you . You 've been juiced . I feel great ! [ Both growl ] [ Both growl ] Noah : [ Grunts ] Rex : [ Growls ] [ Crowd cheering ] Point to the C-Notes . [ Crowd cheering ] You boys are worthless ! What 's it gonna take , boys ? [ Growls ] [ Both growl ] Noah : Uh , Rex ? Rex : Guys , I know what you 're going through . Just let me ... [ Both growl ] [ Growls ] Foul ... multiple balls in play . [ Growls ] [ Grunts ] [ Both growl ] Rex : That 's enough ! You 're gonna hurt someone . [ Growls ] Good idea . Both : You first . Rex : [ Screams ] Don 't just stand there . Go after the shot . [ Both growl ] Rex : Hey ! Noah : You seriously need to work on your parenting skills . Hey , champ , this better end in a win . [ Both growl ] Rex : We 're not playing table tennis anymore , are we ? [ Both growling ] [ Sighs ] Imbeciles . I wish the earth would open and swallow their substandard tests . I should have wished for a pony . Aah ! Rex , theta equals the arc tangent of " b " squared plus or minus the square root of " b " to the 4th minus " g " times gx squared plus yv squared over " g " ! Rex : Got it ! In other words , stomp then smack . Good thinking , Mr. B. Well , just because I don 't like table tennis doesn 't mean I 'm a jerk . [ Screams ] Rex : You need to chill out ! Huh ? So , where is your hotshot teammate ? Where 's our trophy ? - Where 's ... - [ All gasp ] [ All gasp ] [ Thud , cracking ] Noah : Look out ! Aah ! * * * we 're cool ! We 're cool ! I have no idea who won . [ Indistinct conversations ] Smack him ! You call that fighting ? ! Noah : Dude , a little perspective here . [ Both growl ] - [ Gasps ] - You ! [ Gasps ] All because of you ! Rex : Enough ! [ Both scream ] Rex : Wish I could cure you all the way , but that 's all I 've got . It 's okay . I don 't think you entirely knew what you were doing . But you . What were you thinking ? Just trying to do what 's best for my son ... sons ... whatever . Noah : Do you even know what they want ? What a stupid question . They want to be champions . Right , boys ? Actually , dad ... I ... I mean , coach ... We 've always hated table tennis . What we really want to play ... Is piano . Piano ? We 're not kidding . You 're not kidding ? Mm . You know , they have competitions for that . We 're gonna get you the best teachers there are , and you 're gonna win gold records and make me proud . Young man , after witnessing the destruction you caused ... Rex : I caused ? ! I have no choice but to disqualify you from the tournament . And expel you from this high school forever . And I 'm gonna have a word with that principal Haha . Noah : [ Gasps ] Oh , man . No golden paddle ? I already cleared a spot in the trophy case . Rex : It was pretty nice . I was in school for a week , and I was like a regular kid . I even took a pop quiz , and I got an " A. " Dr. Holiday : [ Slurps ] I 'm glad , Rex , because that 's got me thinking . I 've been too lenient in your academic education . Rex : Oh , no . Wait a minute . Dr. Holiday : Starting today , more regular lessons ... Science , history , Spanish . Rex : Spanish ? ! Dr. Holiday : Oh , yes . And I saw that Trig quiz . 98 % ? Do you know how that reflects on me ? I know that you can do better , and you will . Rex : [ Groans ] I wonder if Buchiner will take me back . [ Orchestral fanfare ]

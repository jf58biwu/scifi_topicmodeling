 We 're being followed . I think you should put those away . Why have we come here anyway ? We 're blending in . Acclimatizing . Do you know where we are going ? No . Idiot . We don 't have any money . What is he talking about ? He is a contact . He is uncorrupted . How can you be sure ? I have seen it . He can he trusted . Are you sure about him ? He may have been here too long . He 's erratic . Yes . I remember him . Don 't you ? The class clown . Are you certain he 's not corrupted ? What would we want with food ? We can 't wear these . Choose something for me lo wear , kid . The Glorious 100 were sent to secretly observe the birth and development of another planet for the mutual benefit of our world and their world . The return of the 100 remains the primary mission goal . This is primitive . It must take up so much time . I can 't believe this problem has not been addressed . Our host seems quite taken with these earthly ways . It 's possible he is not as uncorrupted as we first thought . I want to observe the humans . We should wait here where it 's sale . Naseer can tend to us . No . If we return home tomorrow what stories can we tell ? We have eaten food . We have watched yet more films . But we have experienced nothing . I have not even managed to light this cigarette . It 's unsafe . We need to guard the stones . Naseer can look after them . We need to experience this planet . It 's an opportunity that will never be repeated . Come on ... just for a short while . It 's foolish . What if something goes wrong ? Nothing will go wrong . How could it ? I wonder where they 've gone ? Where are they ? Come on , what are you doing ? Keep up . I 'm going to " dance " . You 're what ? Dance over there . Don 't . Will we get there on time ? Yes ... Take these ... Make your preparations . Take them . Hold them tighter . The Glorious 100 were sent to secretly observe the birth and development of another planet of another planet for the mutual benefit of our world and their world . We 're being followed . They 're getting closer . How close ? Closer . How much further ? Damn scoundrel . Moron !

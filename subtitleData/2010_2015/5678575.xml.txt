 This is the last of the uncontaminated stuff . Thanks . Briareos ... How long are we going to keep living like this ? Until we find our paradise . You know that . Yeah . Wonder what I 'll do when we find it ... or at a bar so I can drink ... Or maybe I could be someone 's wife ? Karl would weep with joy if he heard that . I 'm much better with this than a kitchen knife . Four staff members and seven clients have been taken hostage . three of which may be cyborgs . They 're all gathered in 2-2 . The Human Liberation Front is claiming responsibility . They demand the release of their members being held in detention camps . huh ? are you ready ? ! okay . okay . okay . okay . # 5 has engaged ! How long are we gonna let the regular police play around ? 109 . We aren 't here to take the building . 109 . Roger . rookie ! will you ? ! - Stay sharp ! This is not a drill ! 113 . Rabbits have taken the bait and left the burrow . 109 ! Three rabbits detected ! give 109 backup . guys . ready the corral . - Roger . - All set . - Don 't chase them too far ! - Again with that ? Forget the corral ! I can catch ' em myself ! rookie ! Quit worrying ! You all right ? Yes ... Briareos ! Pay more attention to what 's around you ! It still worked out in the end ! Partners are supposed to clean up each other 's messes ! I 'll start with the analysis results . The case likely contained Argonaut-made Damysos parts . huh ... The Argonauts are in Poseidon 's jurisdiction ; have they not yet disposed of them ? Ma 'am . they 're also an important source of information . huh ? once revered as the " Mobile Corporate City . What ? ! The manmade riverside ? ! It can 't be helped . We 're only on leave for 72 hours . so we have to stay in the area . well . Deunan is part African . her mother was shot and killed while crossing a street for white people . her father Karl trained her in how to fight . You took a real beating . Briareos ... Use this . You 'll heal faster . Thanks ... I wish I could go somewhere that isn 't here ... Is this life hard for you ? all I was taught was how to use a knife and gun ... It was never like this when I lived with my mom ... away from here . somewhere paradise-like ... Do you really think such a place exists now ? I know we can find it . I know we can ... Briareos ! Water birds ! Earth to Briareos ... What 's with you ? Are you still thinking about work ? About this morning 's mission ... You 're going to lecture me now ? You should pay more attention to your surroundings . The regular police 's closure was full of holes . It 's their fault a civilian was in the mission area . Cool down . It could 've turned out differently . Just because we 're on a new team now ... What 's the big deal ? I recovered the bait just fine . I can 't rely on those losers . Listen . Most of the other members are more experienced than us . You need to trust them more ! Forget that . I have faith in each person 's skills but you 're the only one I can really trust . then you should quit ES.W.A.T. You don 't understand anything . you 're completely blind when it comes to me ! Stupid Briareos ! I ain 't goin ' home tonight ! Hitomi ! Lemme crash here tonight ! Hitomi ? Deunan ! Let me introduce you ! a bioroid researcher sent here from Poseidon ! Deunan ? I 'm Deia Cides . Forget it ! I ain 't going home ! Why do humans get like this ? A bioroid like you wouldn 't understand ! isn 't it ? Briareos ? Her man . He 's a Hekatoncheires cyborg ! that jerk 's completely blind to women 's feelings ... She 's a member of ES.W.A. T ? sort of . The explosion severely damaged his entire body . Briareos ! Briareos ! Briareos ! Sorry for the trouble . It 's no problem . It happens all the time . Hitomi 's a nice girl . bioroids are designed to serve humans and all . How many humans are there in Olympus ? We humans are only 20 % of the population . Bioroids even run Olympus ' administration . I never imagined that you lived so nearby . Thank you for saving me earlier . It was nothin ' . Just doing my job . see you later . - Yes . Goodnight . Briareos ... You 're nice and warm ... Just talking in her sleep ... Deunan ... If only I 'd been stronger ... If only I 'd been by your side ... We expect a backroom human-smuggling deal . The dead can 't talk . Capture everyone on the list alive . There will be no changes to this operation as briefed . This heavy armor is a real nuisance ... Yeah . It 's useless against supersonic blades . Quit complaining and just wear it . Rules are rules . yeah . - Always so straight-laced . Deunan . These people are going to have your back . you 'll see things you can 't see on your own . Squeeze the trigger before looking at your target ... Always take out anyone who seems suspicious ... That 's how my dad trained me ... That 's my style . 40 seconds to drop point . I 'm assigning 45 to 113 ' s position . 109 will provide backup for 113 . Roger that . You don 't have Briareos to watch your back ! Don 't assume you 'll always have a buddy ! I 'm going on ahead . Stay on your toes ! drop ! 109 ! Copy ! A military model ? but the software seems different . storming in ! ES.W.A. T ! well . So this rabbit hutch is actually the Poseidon ambassador 's dressing room ... This is an international trading port ! We 're essentially standing in my nation 's territory ! This is a flagrant border violation ! We have the Chief of Staff 's approval . your homeland informed us two seconds ago that your diplomatic privileges have been suspended . Poseidon has suspended me ? What has Foreign Minister Araragi said ? ! We can discuss it back at our reception room . Might I ask your bodyguard to stand down ? ES.W.A.T. will see that you remain safe . Magus . I 'm pretty sure that 's Professor Leon . He 's on the international wanted list . A terrorist engineer who works for the Argonauts . Vengeance belongeth unto me . the Argonauts hereby declare independence from Poseidon ! A Hekatoncheires ! Briareos ! Briareos ! Go ... Deunan ... Go ... I know we can find it ... This guy 's good ! What kind of armor is this ? ! Thanks . after all . Our " ? Don 't you mean your ? Perhaps . How did you guys even make it out of there alive ? let me tell you ... Don 't look so down . Briareos ... Is this really our paradise ?

 Previously on Fringe ... There is an alternate universe , and in it another version of us . Put your hands up . Do you know what she is ? A shapeshifter . She was once just a human being . You must be very proud . Oh , I am . Of all of them . 47 so far . That tracker we had on Jones , how did he pinpoint the wavelength we were on that quickly ? What , you think someone from our team told him ? You have a better idea ? I don 't know if she told you this , but when I first met her , I had lost my partner . Robert . He and his wife Julie , they had this incredible relationship . The way she looked at him , Olivia looks at you that same way . I hadn 't realized how much I longed for family . Yeah . They 're great . It 's perfect . What 's going on ? Shh . It 's grazing day . Grazing day ? Walter thinks that she 's depressed . Well , technically , it 's seasonal affective disorder . Bovines aren 't meant to spend extended periods inside . They need lots of vitamin D. Sunshine . Taking a day trip out to Warwick . That 's where her favorite pasture is . I see . I almost forgot , I , uh ... I found this in my apartment . I think it might be yours . It has a name engraved on the back . " Robert Danzig . " He was your partner , wasn 't he ? Yeah . It was his . How did I wind up with it ? Actually , I gave it to you . A few months back , when you came to see me at the hospital . It was a thank you for saving my life . You don 't remember me telling you what this symbolizes ? It 's native American . The maze represents the journey of life . The obstacles , making the right choices . Until we find ourselves in the center . What 's in the center ? Home . A place to belong . Danzig knew I was never much for putting down roots . I never really stayed in the same place too long . He used to joke that if I kept living like that , that one day I would just float off into space . So he gave me this as a reminder that I always had a home . With him , with his family . This , he said , was my tether . Olivia . The sedative . Gene 's getting anxious . We should be on our way . Excuse me . Here . Let me give you a hand with those . Thank you . Let me guess . Gene 's picnic lunch ? [ Laughs ] Yeah , I wish . Apparently , the other side is requesting a detailed debrief of our recent run-ins with David Robert Jones . And given the gaps in Agent Dunham 's memory , Broyles thinks its best if somebody else goes . Lucky me . You sound less than enthused . I was supposed to take my dad to Castle Island today . I promised him . Breaking promises . One of the many perks of the job . Yes , sadly . What if I went for you ? Not to diminish Agent Farnsworth 's assignment , but liaison duty is more of a formality . Part of our mutual cooperation agreement . I disagree . Coordinating with the other side could yield new leads on Jones . Right now , we have nothing to go on . You 're more valuable to me on this side . I appreciate the sentiment , but there is nothing going on here today . Unless you count grazing day . " Grazing day " ? Look , Agent Dunham and the others are busy . Agent Farnsworth already has family obligations . I don 't have anywhere to be . Frankly , I think I could use the time away . Hi . Please ... Please wha- - what do you want ? That was a mistake . I 'm sorry ! Oh ! Ah ! Ahh ! Oh , God ... Oh , God . ♪ Fringe 4x17 ♪ Everything in Its Right Place Original Air Date on April 6 , 2012 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ♪ Initiating scan . Scan complete . Agent Lee , please come this way . You can go ahead and get set up in here . I 'll let Captain Lee and Agent Dunham know you 've arrived . Agent Lee . Agent Dunham . Nice to see you again . Yeah . Would 've been nicer if you brought me a cafe latte instead of that pile of paperwork , but ... Uh , maybe next time . Change of plans . You 're gonna brief on the way . On the way where ? Okay , so , Jones is responsible for dosing Agent Dunham with Cortexiphan . For what purpose ? Peter Bishop believes he was trying to activate some kind of latent ability . What , are we talking heat vision , or communicating with fish ? Your guess is as good as mine . Well , did it work ? Yes . And no . There were some unforeseen side effects . Long story . That 's why they sent you here instead of her ? Or did you just draw the short straw ? What 's that ? The Department of Containment 's reopening this part of the city . Zone 13-A , more commonly referred to as Parkside , was closed on November 12th , 2004 , due to severe toxic air conditions . There is one live media alert on this subject . Would you like to play it ? Go on . Don 't be shy . Uh , yes . This is a turning point in our history . In the last week alone , 11 previously uninhabitable zones have been reopened . Our cities are healing . Our world is being restored . But the process will take time . So , as we celebrate this recovery , let us never forget those we 've lost . Thank you , everyone . I take it things are starting to get better because of the bridge ? Yeah , it 's stabilized spatial rifts in the ambered areas . Don 't know how it works . Don 't care . I 'm just happy . Hmm . Hey , want to settle a bet ? Sure . If I can . What 's your middle name ? Tyrone . Seriously ? Yeah , it was my great grandfather 's name . - Huh . - Why ? What 's up , Tyrone ? How the hell did you- - - Hey . - Hey . Why would you tell her that ? You don 't like Tyrone ? I think it 's a strong middle name . He 's been my partner for six years , and yet he wouldn 't tell me his middle name . My bad . Ha . Okay , so , what 's the skinny ? We 've got the body of an unidentified assailant . A woman named Paige Randall placed an emergency call last night , after she was assaulted walking to her car . She reports that during the attack , someone saved her . Well , you think this may have something to do with the vigilante cases PD 's been working ? My thoughts exactly . Local police received a dozen similar reports in the last few months . Criminals going missing , junkies mysteriously vanishing , victims calling in , claiming that their assailants were attacked mid-crime . Maybe Batman 's moved to the Bronx . What 's a " Batman " ? The caped crusader , the Dark Knight . Billionaire playboy puts on a cape to clean up the streets of Gotham . Oh , you mean Mantis . Seriously ? Your superhero is an insect ? Oh , what , ' cause nothing says " badass " like a flying rat ? I don 't think Mantis or Batman could 've done this . Were all the other bodies like this ? There 've been no other bodies . This is the first one we 've found . So , assuming this is our guy , makes you wonder why he left this body behind . What 's changed ? Seven parts per million . Nominal readings . So far so good . How ' bout a souvenir ? You remember this match ? That was the most brutal 14 rounds I 've ever seen . Thanks . I 'd rather forget it . I lost two fillmores on that fight . Four parts per million . I think we 're all clear here . I 'll call it in to dispatch . Hey , just a second . I 'm reading high amounts of tissue organics . Must be a false positive . I don 't think so . Pat Wilkinson got the same reading yesterday . According to this , it 's coming from inside the church . Someone 's been in here . This zone 's been uninhabitable for eight years . Hello ? Anyone here ? What is that ? Oh , my God . Hey . I 'm sorry about the timing . It looks like this is gonna tie us up for a while , so debrief 's gonna have to wait . Yeah . Of course . I get it . Uh--Reynolds ? Agent Lee is gonna need a ride back to the DOD , and then also an escort to the bridge . Uh , wait , what ? Oh , I just assumed under the circumstances you 'd want to return to your side until we 're freed up . Oh , no , that 's okay . I don 't have to go . I mean , it 's no problem for me . I 'd like to stay and be of assistance . If I can . Lincoln ? Sure . Um , excuse me . Agent Lee ? I just wanted to tell you , uh ... Well , thanks . Um ... You 're welcome . What was that about ? Does he think I 'm him ? No , he knows who you are . He 's just thanking you , because our world , in part , is healing because our two sides are working together . I mean , your team may toil away in secret over there , but over here , you 're heroes . Hmm . Afternoon . What 's your name ? Canaan . My name is Canaan . Nice to meet you . I 'm Helen . I haven 't seen you around here before . Do you have a place to stay ? I-I did . I just ... It 's gone now . I 'm sorry to hear that . Can I carry this for you ? Sure . Thanks . Well , we 'll have to find you a place to sleep tonight . It 's too cold to be on the street . Father Luis has got the availability of all the shelters . I 'll check in with him . You go ahead and dig in . Thank you . Be right back . Hey , mister . You got something on your neck . Canaan ! I count 18 bodies and 19 heads . A few months ago , I 'd have a much harder time stomaching something like this . Took me a while too . Not ' Liv , though . Things like this never phase her . She 's the tough one . All our years working together , never once seen her barf or shed a tear . Hey , Lincoln . Mine . What do you got , Red ? Okay , someone or something was living here . And whatever it was must have realized that its lair was about to be compromised with this zone being reopened . Which is why it left its last victim behind last night . Yeah . I found this on that body over there . Nice work . We can run this through facial rec . Maybe I.D. the victim . Tell me something . Do you people have any way of determining time of death ? I mean , with the remains in this condition ? Uh , yeah , provided there are certain active enzymes or lactic acid still in the tissue . Sure . Why ? What 're you thinking ? I 'd like to see all the surveillance feeds from the areas around this zone . I 'm confused . Why are we doing this , exactly ? The likelihood of finding surveillance of the victim after she disappeared has a probability rate of , at best , 1 in 86.7 thousand . Humor me . So to speak . Time of death on our headless corpse . You want to tell me why you needed it ? Not worth mentioning just yet . I 'll let you know if it pans out . Maybe you 'll also tell me why it is you don 't want to go back home . What 're you talking about ? Back at the church , Olivia tried to arrange for your return trip to the other side , but you weren 't having any . There a problem ? No problem , just ... They can handle things fine without me . Well , that 's the difference between us . My world wouldn 't survive without me . Yeah . I noticed that about you . Your unwavering confidence . Thanks . Bordering on self-aggrandizing narcissism . Don 't get me wrong , I could use some of that myself . We 're not much alike , you and me . Not that I can see . Where did you grow up ? Why ? I 'm just looking for where our paths diverged . Teaneck , New Jersey . Me too . Till my mom died , and then my dad moved us- - To Philadelphia . He started a business there . Lee 's Hardware . Huh . How about that ? Hamilton High ? Yup . Tenth grade science teacher . Mr. Glasberg . Graduating GPA . 3.85 . I slacked off my senior year- - to work at my dad 's store . Prom date . A-ha . I didn 't go to prom , I 'd just broken up with- - Alicia Dvoskin . Is this normal ? Sharing so much of the same history ? Captain Lee , Agent Lee , system is registering an 82 % face rec to the photo in the locket . What are those growths on her face ? I don 't know . But you approximated her time of death between 1 : 00 and 3 : 00 a.m. - Five days ago . - Yeah ? Check the time code . That footage was taken more than two days later . That 's impossible . She can 't be walking around after she died . I ran those tests twice . It doesn 't make any sense . Actually , it does . I just needed something like this to confirm it . Confirm what ? A shapeshifter ? You think our vigilante is a shapeshifter . Yes , sir . Do you two concur ? We have surveillance of the victim more than two days after time of death . Granted . But I 'm still not convinced , with apologies , Captain Lee , that an error wasn 't somehow made in the lab . I just don 't see anything in this case that correlates at all with what we know about shapeshifters . You 're right . Not the versions you 've encountered , Agent Broyles . Colonel . Sorry . Colonel Broyles . Ever since my partner was killed by one of these things , I 've become somewhat of an expert on shapeshifters . I 've studied each and every file , every detail my team had on the subject . Now , the earlier biosynthetic versions required a three pronged device in order to acquire the victim 's appearance . The device needed to be jammed onto the victim 's palate , leaving a three-pronged indentation on the roof of the mouth . Which is what we found inside Bree Collins at the church . And the other bodies ? Did they have the same markings ? Nothing conclusive . Well , I 've read these files too , Agent Lee . And the unique state in which we found those bodies in the church bears no resemblance to corpses left by the earlier shapeshifter prototypes . Now , how do you explain that ? I can 't . And further , how would you reconcile this version 's M.O. with David Robert Jones' agenda ? Why would Jones be targeting criminals ? I 'm sorry , but I suspect in your desire to avenge your partner , you may be unconsciously perverting the evidence to fit the profile of a shapeshifter . Colonel , I don 't think- - Agent Lee , we appreciate the assistance you 've given us . But as you were here for a simple sharing of intel , it may be in the interest of both our agencies if you returned home . As for you two , alert me when you have something more concrete . Well , that went well . Here ! You know , you 're really good . Thanks . Dawes , ya jackass ... Told you not to take so much . It 's all we got till morning . Shut up , Mikey . I gotta take a leak . Colonel Broyles ... PD 's reporting an eyewitness account that may be related to our vigilante suspect . How long ago ? Six minutes . Where ? Precinct 17 , northwest quadrant . In the Pelham district . Have P.D. lock down the perimeter , five-block radius . We have an I.D. on the victim ? Affirmative . Victim 's name is Antonio Dawes . His record includes possession and distribution of narcotics , auto theft , burglary . Fits our profile . Contact the local P.D. Tell ' em to be on the lookout for suspicious activity . 'Scuse me , Colonel . Agent Lee , I thought you were on your way home . I think should circulate Dawes ' mug shot . If we 're dealing with a shapeshifter , that 's what he 'll look like . What have we got to lose ? Agent Farnsworth , upload the photo onto the citywide database . I 'll scan traffic cams in the area too . Good . Captain Lee , assemble a TAC team . And keep me apprised of the situation . Yes , sir . Always do . Come on . You 're with me . Okay , we want him alive . If you want Jones- - I 'm getting Jones . I 'm not gonna let this thing kill again . Dunham . We have a sighting of a man matching Dawes 's photo moving up Copenhagen towards 146th Street . Captain Lee is setting up a perimeter now . Copy that . We 're on our way . I remind you , our objective is to surround the subject and bring him in alive . We 'll split into three teams . You two , you go with Agent Dunham , you 'll be taking the high ground . You three , go to the south entrance of the alley . If he makes a break for it , you cut him off . Rest of you are with me . We 're going in from the north . Tactical teams , be advised , we have lost visual on the suspect . Projected trajectory is south of last position . Lincoln , you copy that ? Copy . That could put him in your vicinity . Got it . Listen , Broyles shouldn 't have come down on you like that . If it wasn 't for you and your shapeshifter bent , we wouldn 't be onto this one . What I 'm saying is ... You 're a good Agent . Good as you ? Let 's not get crazy . I been doing this a lot longer than you . Which leads me back to why . Our lives seemed pretty parallel , but somewhere along the line , we became very different people . Maybe it 's free will . I don 't buy that we 're all just defined by our circumstances . Maybe I just made a choice to become the man I wanted to be . Girls , you might want to get off the line , 'cause some of us are actually trying to work here . Sorry , mother . Got him . Southwest of our position . Astrid ? Searching . Visual confirmed . Suspect is 50 meters from Agent Lee . He 's made us ! He 's on the move ! Suspect has entered the southwest building . Agent Lee is in pursuit . Drop the weapon now ! Don 't shoot ! Drop it . Suspect is being secured on site . Excellent work . Relay my congratulations to Captain Lee and his team . Yes , sir . We have him in custody . 148th Street warehouse , just west of Amsterdam . They 'll be moving him at the rear . Thank you , Colonel . We 'll take it from here . Broyles just dispatched secure transport , so we 're moving in ten . I want five minutes . Just to talk to him . What for ? Jones created the shapeshifter that killed my partner . If this thing has any information that could lead us to him , I want to know . I 'm under orders . I mean , you can talk to him once he 's been processed . Once you take him back , he 's gonna go so high up the food chain I 'll never get to him . You know that as well as I do . If it were your partner , you 'd do the same . Five minutes . Could you give us a moment ? You had the chance to kill me back there , and you didn 't . Why ? Who are you ? Who were you ? You were human once , right ? Do you always keep mementos from the lives of people you 've become ? It 's mine . This is your son . I wish he was . There was once someone in my life . It 's her boy . And Jones . He took you from them when he did this to you . No . He came later . She left me on her own . Took Daniel with her . They just went on living their lives as though I were never there . As if I meant nothing to them . I 've never really been a ... There are these people you come across . These bright , bright lights . They drift through life effortlessly . Unforgettable . I 'm not one of them . I wanted to be needed . Or at least to be missed . Do you understand ? I do . For that , I needed to be more than I am . Something unique . Doctor Jones understood that . He promised to make me like no one else . I was to be the first of a new breed of human beings . But I was a disappointment . 'Cause you didn 't turn out the way he planned . You 've been targeting criminals . Sparing innocent lives . Stealing their DNA . That 's what 's keeping you alive , isn 't it ? David Robert Jones is not someone worth protecting . You were disposable to him . as disposable as you were to Daniel . You don 't know that . He promised he would come for me . To fix me . I 'm sorry . You have a 20 on the shooter ? Negative ! Hold your fire ! Hold fire ! Secure the prisoner ! The shooter--where is he ? Down , down ! Check the windows ! He 's on the roof . Cover me ? Rooftop ! Rooftop ! He 's on the roof ! Now , now , now ! Suspect down ! Everyone okay ? Officer down ! Officer down ! - Who knew ? - What ? Who else knew we were transporting him ? - We gotta find out . - Hey , Linc . Medevac 's on the way . You 're gonna be fine . 'Liv ... I been blown up before . This is nothing . Was a hell of a shot . I guess you still haven 't lost your touch . Hey ! This was meant for you ! Do you understand that ? Jones ! The man that you are protecting just tried to have you killed ! It 's time to wake up . He is never gonna welcome you back into the fold . But he has to . I don 't know what to do . Yes , you do . You can keep waiting for somebody else to define you , to give you your place in the world , or you can decide that you 're not just somebody 's broken puppet anymore . Choose ! Welcome back , sir . I trust you have good news for me . I do . That 'll be all . It 's done . We 've tied up our loose end . Nice job . Was there any resistance ? The redhead almost took my head off with a nearly impossible shot . That girl always amazes me . She and the one from the other side . Well , he 'll be pleased we 've taken care of the problem at hand . Now we just need for him to- - Someone 's overriding the security system . There 's been a breach . Canaan ... Where is she ? Stop where you are ! Understood . Well , let me know the moment she 's in the building . Agent Broyles , I have something to report . I already heard . We have Nina Sharp in custody . There something else ? You 're not gonna believe this . What is it ? Blueprints , passports , aliases ... Yeah . Hell of a window into Jones 's operation . It 's more than that . Check this out . It 's a tracking board . We knew that every shapeshifter was outfitted with a tracking module . Mm-hmm . I think this is some kind of central hub . You 're saying that- - that you think every one of these dots represents a shapeshifter ? If we can hack this mainframe , we 'll have the identity of every agent in Jones 's network . Can I have a word , Agent Dunham ? What 's going on ? Captain Lee . He didn 't make it . Initiate scan . Scan complete . I 'd heard rumors of another world . Wasn 't sure it really existed . It does . What 're we doing here ? Making good on my offer . There 's a man here who 'll be able to help you . Agent Lee . Canaan , this is Peter and Walter Bishop . It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 'm really looking forward to studying- - uh ... helping you . I think you 'll like it there . You don 't have to wait for somebody to give you a home , or live on the outside anymore . Here . To keep you from floating away . Thank you . For everything . Hello ? Hey . I thought that you would be long gone by now . You know what ? I- - I wasn 't thinking . My face is probably the last thing you want to see right now . - Maybe I should go- - - Lincoln . It 's fine . What 's up ? We collected a lot of intel on Jones . There 's more work to be done . I thought I 'd stick around for a while . I figured you 'd need some help . Thanks . That 'd be nice . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

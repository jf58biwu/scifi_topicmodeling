 # Two ... two , three ... # # # After centuries as a delivery boy , nothing surprises me . You stink , loser . Hey , Fry ! Pizza going out ! Come on ! Aw , all right . I 'll take the Red Rocket . Hello ! Pizza delivery for ... D. Frosted Wang ? Ugh , not another crank delivery ! Why don 't I read these ahead of time ? One time was funny . But every week for ten years ? Not as funny . True , not as funny . But still somewhat funny . And-and then they burst out laughing a second time . I 've been a delivery boy for a thousand years . Isn 't there any room for promotion around here ? There 'll be no promotions unless somebody dies . And even then , only if we can 't bring them back as a zombie , like Scruffy . Life and death are a seamless continuum . Mm-hmm . Well , could I at least get some encouragement ? I could use a shot in the arm . I get shot in the leg ! Roberto ! What are you doing here ? What ? A fella can 't drop in on old friends and hold them hostage ? I 'm good . And you ? Attention , criminal robot in the building ! Come out with your hands up ! - Never ! - Uh ... other guy . Listen up , piggies , I want a hovercopter , and an unmarked sandwich , and a new face with like a , a Hugh Grant look . And every five minutes I don 't get it , someone 's going to get stabbed in the ass ! He 's bluffing . Ouch ! He 's not bluffing ! You call for a chopper ? Nah , I specifically said hovercopter ! One chopper , coming up . Hi-yah ! Ah ! All right ! Way to go . You know , URL , sometimes it 's almost too much for me . You mean the respect we get ? And the high level of job satisfaction ? There 's that , but I 'm also talking about the non-stop promotions and the free hot rod . Mm . I do love a man in uniform . Ahem ! I mean a uniform that doesn 't involve short pants . I can see I have no future here . My only option is to resign with dignity . Here are my shorts . # # Hello . I 'd like to enroll in Police Academy . You think you can just waltz in here with no pants and become a cop ? That 's the plan . I like you , kid . I got no pants on , either . I can see that . You 're quite a bit taller than me . Welcome to Police Academy . Hi , I 'm Fry . I 'm a Sound Effects 5000 . Weep , wop , beep ! Wow . That would be impressive if you were a human . Yeah . On your feet for Chief O 'Manahan . At ease , cadets . I 'll make this short and sweet , 'cause I 'm PMSing like a lumberjack . Police Academy is not for everybody . You 're gonna get your boob scuffed . But if you 've got the vulva to stick it out , I 'll be proud to call you ladies policemen . Sir ! Yes , ma 'am ! Yeah . That 's great . Now , can you actually turn on the ignition ? I don 't have any hands . Well , it 's that time of the month . Graduation day . So grow a pair and put them together for our new officers ! Good job ! Hooray for the pigs ! Graduates , you are hereby officially cops . Now move it along , nothing to see here . Hooray ! Free sky sticks ! Oh ! Police brutality ! Nice ... All right . Before we head out , I 'll be teaming up our new officers with their ironically matched partners . Sound Effects 5000 , you 'll be with Cranski . Ow , my tinnitus ! Fry , due to the unfortunate loss of Officer Smith , you 'll be riding with URL . And Smitty was just a few days from retirement . Wh-What happened ? He took a early retirement . Damn . Let 's get down to business . Aren 't you going to say , " Good news , everyone " ? Oh , I just said that for Fry 's benefit . Made the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job . As much as I miss him , he didn 't really serve much purpose around here . Though he did walk Zoidberg . In any case , I 've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board , so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him . Me ? So where we going ? Pandora . That dangerous 3D planet ? Can 't we just send our avatars ? No , it 's cheaper just to have you die . Whoa . 15 miles over the speed of light . That 's a violation of the law of Lorentz 's invariants , baby . Light ' em up . Look out for that particular individual ! An electric wall , eh ? I can 't see the harm in peeing on that . Whoa ! Where 'd my man learn that ? Sunny D commercial . Let 's refract this sucker . DNA and career chip , please . Erwin Schrodinger , huh ? What 's in the box , Schrodinger ? Um ... a cat , some poison , and a cesium atom . is it alive or dead ? Alive or dead ? Answer him , fool . It 's a superposition of both states until you open it and collapse the wave function . Says you . There 's also a lot of drugs in there . So ... you 're a robot ? You boys did good . Nailed a major violator of the laws of physics . He 's going down . Cat 's gonna testify . Guys like this really bust my uterus . You 're both getting a promotion . Ever heard of the Future Crimes Division ? Tomorrow , I have . Oops . I can 't make out a thing . Well , I guess you should have had two eyes . Just deliver the package , and let 's get out of here . Screw that ! I ain 't no delivery boy . I 'm the company chef . Oh , you 're the chef , are you ? Then why don 't you make us something nice to eat ? Here 's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich ! Now that we can predict crimes with 99 % accuracy , we can arrest most perpetrators before they even perpetrate anything . That 's ridiculous . Only horoscopes can predict the future . That 's what we used to think . Until we invented ... this . Ooh . Slow down , baby . The Cybernetic Oracle . The ultimate man-machine hybrid . Programmed with every crime ever recorded , and implanted with the brain cells of history 's greatest detectives . We call him ... Pickles . On account of it 's like he 's floating in a jar ? Exactly . The Oracle 's visions are recorded on these colored balls . Green is larceny . Black is fraud . homicide . What 's pink polka-dots ? Clown slaughter . It happens more often than you 'd think . Floater in the bowl ! Red ball . Homicide ! Whoo ! male , six foot one . Distinctive mustard stain on his forehead . My kajigger ! Hattie McDoogal . Look , the clock says 5 : 08 . It 's 4 : 30 right now . Uh-oh , we only have a half hour to chill out before we head over . Oh , Hattie . When I look into your one good eye , I see a reflection of beauty . Oh ! Fresh . Freeze , fool . You 're under arrest for future murder ! Yeah ? You can 't arrest me for future murder ... after it 's right now murder ! My kajigger ! So he didn 't really want to marry me ? Nah . See , he knew you left everything to your parakeets in your will . He was going to murder you , marry your parakeets , and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone . Classic move . Aw , yeah . Congratulations on your big bust . You , too . Keep it up , and you boys might just make detective . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I got to go drop a big one . Wow . I can 't believe it . One more promotion , and I 'll be a real detective , like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy . Eight pounds . I 'm naming her Burt . Mazel tov , Chief . That 's a beautiful bathroom baby . Hey , you heading home , Phil ? In a minute . I just want to finish this paperless work . Don 't stay up too late . We got a lot of people to shoot tomorrow . Hello ! Anyone ? There 's never a cop around when you need one . Green ball . Larceny . Hmm . The thief seems to be some sort of ghost . Or is he ? Aah ! Bender ? Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year . That 's not funny . It 's not supposed to be funny . It 's a business meeting . Things used to be funny around here . Noses were picked , pants fell down . So what changed ? Only Fry could say , and he 's gone . Hey . Bender and Leela are back from Pandora . How was it ? Awful . We had nothing to say to each other , so we had to listen to Bender 's Eagles album for 27 hours . Beats talking to you , witchy woman . Hey , he 's back ! Look at you . Hubba hubba . Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles . Good afternoon , individuals . Sir , would you mind stepping out of the building ? Normally , when a cop asks me that , I spray whip cream in his eyes and run away , but to ditch these losers , gladly . Bender , be honest with me . Are you planning a big heist ? Usually , but not at the moment . I only ask 'cause the Oracle thinks you 're going to pull off a major theft next Thursday . Next Thursday , you say ? Pray , continue . Are you familiar with this particular location ? I may have a burgling familiarity with it . Does the word " Maltese " mean anything to you ? The Maltese Liquor- - the strongest , the most valuable malt liquor ever brewed ! And soon it will be mine . I 'm sorry . You were saying ? Bender , I 'm only telling you this so you can avoid committing the crime . " Avoid committing the crime . " Got it . You wrote " commit the crime " ! Oh , there 's got to be some way to stop Bender . Maybe something in the Oracle 's predictions that I missed before due to incompetence . Wait . Who 's the trigger-happy jerk ? That 's me ! I recognize the face . You shot me ! You miserable dingus ! No ! No ! What have I will have done ? Man , that 's heavy . Osmium heavy . Wha ... ? Are you going to turn me in for concealing evidence ? Say what ? You 're my partner , home Fry . Besides , I got my own secrets . Anything big worth checking out ? Just your big jangly booty , baby . See you tonight , toots . You ... and the chief ? Mm-hmm . We been gettin ' it on . Right there in your chair . I 'm like , " Oh , baby ! Oh , baby ! " And she 's like , " Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . " I would never shoot Bender . Never ! He taught me how to shave . Revision ball . By deciding not to shoot Bender , you created an alternate future . I could never shoot you . Never ! You taught me how to shave . See ? Just get out of here . Go ! Now , dig the unintended consequences . My friends , let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend , Bender . Oops . The Maltese Liquor done destroyed their brains . Fools should have known it 's fatal for anyone but robots and Billy Dee Williams . So , if I don 't shoot Bender , all my other friends will die ? Fate is a freaky mistress . Much like the chief . Look out ! Something 's not right . I refuse to believe it . Rewind . Ooh . Are you the calloused working man I ordered ? Uh , sure . In order to fix your leaky roof , I 'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar . I 'll be upstairs putting batteries in things . Whoa ! The Maltese Liquor . 40 ounces of heaven ! Here , boy . This is for you . Ah . Hmm . Invisible safe , eh ? Aah ! Ah , yeah , baby ! 210 proof . That 's all the proof I need . Put the bottle back . We both know I won 't do that . Either you 're going to shoot me , or I 'm going to spray whip cream in your eyes and walk out of here like a big shot . Bender , no ! You don 't have to do something just ' cause it 's going to happen . The future 's making a chump out of you . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm going to make a chump out of the future . I 'm not stealing anything ! Yes ! I stopped the crime without shooting you . The Oracle was wrong . Was I ? Pickles ? Yes . It is I , Pickles . I set the whole thing up . Everyone will think Bender 's the thief while I make off with that glorious brew . Seriously ? Why ? So I can kill my human brain cells . Do you have any idea what a burden it is to know everything that will ever happen ? To never be surprised . To know the punch line of every joke hours in advance . Like watching Leno . And that is why I faked the prediction of this crime . Nevertheless- - stay with me here- - things will now happen just as I fake predicted . Bender , you 're going to hand me that bottle . Not that one ! The real one , which you switched when Fry stupidly looked away . Hey . Ah , man . Why you got to be so Oracle-y ? Fry , you are going to shoot Bender , killing him and shattering the fake bottle , just as I predicted . Do it ! It is your destiny ! Funny thing about destiny . Sometimes fate has other plans . Oh , nuts . You shot me ! You miserable dingus ! And now the part I didn 't show you . Everyone will think Bender killed you , and I walk away with the goofy juice ! Finally , blissful ignorance . I have no idea what 's going to happen next . Did you get that , Chief ? Huh ? We got it all from behind this prediction-proof glass . But how could you know my prediction was fake ? I knew something was wrong , but I couldn 't put my finger on it . Then it hit me . You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends . Bender would never share . The very idea ! So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy . With the added benefit of me and the chief being locked in a small room . Shall we adjourn to the dungeon ? Well , I got my shield for stopping Bender . But then I got fired for tipping off Bender . Fry , we have no idea what you do around here , but we desperately need you back . Really ? Um , I don 't suppose there 's any chance I could get a promotion . Sure . What the heck ? I hear by promotion , executive delivery boy . Executive ? It 's a meaning less title . But it helps insecure people feel better about themselves . I feel better about myself !

 On October 13 , 2008 , Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing 283 minutes of filmed material . This film is a rough-cut version of that material . Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated . A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic . They concluded that it was authentic . Ready ? Turn on the radio . - Johanna , do you have sound ? - Yes . This isn 't working . Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda . A hunting party arrived there today . The leader of the hunting party had the following to say : We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly . Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us . Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses . I know every single bear hunter in Norway . That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter . If he 's gunning for our bear , he 's breaking the law . - Have you ever seen him ? - We see him all over . If I see him again , there 'll be consequences . He 's nothing but a poacher . - What would you like to tell him ? - To lay his cards on the table . Drive ! - There 's too much traffic . - We 're going to lose him ! Ready ? We know his name is Hans , but we have no last name . Thomas , try being more serious . But what is he doing in Volda ? Who is he ? - Do we have sound ? - You haven 't plugged in the ... You won 't get an interview with a poacher . I don 't like it when you ridicule him . That 's great ! Thank you . Bye . Thomas , that poacher is staying at the campground ! I can 't say I know him , but he is here . He 's staying right over here . Want me to show you ? I don 't know what that smell is , but his camper sure reeks ! - What are all those things ? - I have no idea . Thyme ? He drives off and stays out all night . He 's never back before sunrise . - He stays out all night ? - Yes . Every night . - In good spirits ? - Sure . We don 't know when or if he 'll show up . - There he is ! - I 'm filming . Just ask him directly . Hi . My name 's Thomas . We 're from Volda College . Could we ask you a few questions ? Get lost . Maybe we could come back ... - Did it work ? - Quiet , I hear something . Yes , I 'm on my way out now . I expect to find it tonight . Okay , fine . Bye . - He isn 't here . - He was right in front of us ! Sure , but ... - Shit ! - Nice work , Thomas . - Can you see anything ? - Yeah . Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling . And there 's a shotgun . We 're on our way to where a bear was just found shot . Could he have been the shooter ? Lord knows where this one came from . I 've checked with every registered bear hunter I know . None of them shot this one . The bear population is managed by the state . So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss . Look at this . These tracks don 't match the way a bear normally walks . I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here . - That 's weird . - I agree . Very weird . You 're from the Wildlife Board . Finn Haugan , right ? These hunters say those aren 't bear tracks . That 's ridiculous . What else would they be ? There is a bear right there , with tracks all around it . - But why are they in doubt ? - Ask them ! It 's crazy . We have waited for Hans for hours , but now he 's finally moving . We think he 's heading somewhere , and we are going to follow him . Go ! It looks like he 's heading for the ferry . How long are we going to keep following him ? Can you see what he 's carrying ? It 's a car tire . - What 's he doing ? - I can 't tell . Three , two , one , and ... Sogn og Fjordane county ! Okay , he 's over there . Just hide here . We met a little while back . - Really ? - Thomas , from Volda College . - Is that ... - Are you following me ? We just want to ask you a couple of questions . No . Are you ... What were you doing in Volda ? Did you shoot that bear ? Stay the hell away from me . Turn that off . Leave me alone ! Once we get what we need , we can go back . It would be so awesome to get him to talk . We have tried , plenty of times . Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try ? Left arm or right foot ? The one you kick with ? We have been here all afternoon . I think he 's sleeping in his trailer . So now we wait until something happens . Are you serious ? Okay . I have to get my sound gear . What is this ? " No trespassing . Blasting area . " Did you see that ? Was that a road ? Did you ? This road is horrible . If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers , your ass is first ... - I 'm not ... - Stop whining . - I 'm just being honest . - Want to go back ? - Fine by me . - That 's not what I meant . Hey , wait for me ! Look here . I don 't think he 's in his car . - So we know he 's here ... - But what is he up to ? Here 's a trail . - I hear something in the distance . - What ? Troll ! Thomas ! Hurry ! My car is right over here ! - What ? - Something bit me ! - Are you all right ? - It stings . - You heard him yell " troll , " right ? - Shut up . You need some more . - Can I help ? - There 's gauze in the first-aid kit . - Ow ! Don 't ... - We have to get this out . You look like hell , Thomas . - What the hell was that ? - Tetanus shot . You yelled something back there in the woods . - You heard him , Johanna . - What 's this slime ? What did he say ? - More ? - Yes . Can you give us a ride to our car ? It isn 't very smart to follow me . Did you yell " troll " out there ? - Is that your car ? - What the hell ? - What happened ? - That 's our car ! Someone crushed our car . It 's completely demolished . Look at this , Thomas . - Hans , do you understand this ? - I have an idea . Okay , what ... A bear didn 't do this . What do you think happened ? - What ... - Ask him if a troll did it . Hey , if you know what happened to my car , you should say so ! - You yelled " troll " . - Forget about that ! What the hell do you want ? You want me to say trolls exist , on film ? - You find that funny ? - No , but you don 't actually believe ... If you want a ride , you 'd better come right now . - What should we do ? - I think I 'll walk . You have our bags ? Just so we get this straight : you actually believe trolls exist ? Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you ? What 's the matter ? Why are we stopping ? Thanks for giving us a ride . We 'd love to join you , and film what you do . We 'd be very interested . I 'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you , on one condition : You do exactly as I say , no matter what I say . Okay ? Yes . I feel like I 'm bleeding everywhere . - Are you admiring your wound ? - Yuck ! Don 't film that ! - You 're crazy . - I 'm serious . - Why call them ? - To tell them where we are . He isn 't dangerous , just weird . Remember , he runs the show . We do exactly as he says . Then we 'll get our footage . No one here believes in God or Jesus ? Nope . None of us . Don 't look at me . Serious ? Because they can smell " the blood of a Christian man " ? Is that alright ? Close the gate and hang up that sign . NO TRESPASSING . BLASTING AREA . - Is this a land mine ? - Yes . But it isn 't armed . I 'm sitting on a land mine ? Are you nuts ? Anyone who doesn 't want to join me ? Who 's changed their mind ? Who 's afraid of trolls ? - No . - No ? Good . Go down to that creek , take off all your clothes , and scrub yourselves . - Especially your armpits and groin . - No way ! - Why ? - To remove any body odor . Then rub this all over yourselves and your clothes . - What is that ? - Troll stench . - Rub it all over your bodies . - It reeks ! No way . Forget about it . You have to smell like a troll , or they 'll smell us and run away . Christ ! - No . No way ! - I 'm not doing this , Thomas . Forget about it ! You agreed to do exactly as I said . If you don 't do it , I 'll go up there alone and leave you here . Is that understood ? Are you ready ? You 're all greased up ? You look cute . Here , flashlights for you . - What is that ? - A big flash bulb , basically . Hans ? That weapon . How do you use it ? It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam . UVB rays . The same as the sun , or a tanning lamp . Don 't you know sunlight turns them to stone , Thomas ? - Right . Or they explode . - Haven 't you read anything ? I read fairy tales when I was a kid , but ... Did you know that , Kalle ? So , what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you ? Eating contest ? Fairy tales usually don 't match reality . They seem to in this case . - Troll piss . - Christ ! You can smell it all the way over here . Listen , I 'm hunting a Ringlefinch . There 's piss everywhere . He 's marking . Looks like he 's been chased from his territory . He seems sick . I 'd like to find out what 's wrong with him . A blood sample from the troll ? I don 't have the right equipment . You too . Bye . I need help to find out what 's wrong . But a blood sample ... That won 't be easy . Who were you talking to ? A veterinarian . A vet ! If you wait here , I 'll try to chase the troll out . Is this what you imagined ? I bet it 's going to take him some time to find a troll out there . I feel sorry for him if he really believes in trolls . Maybe he 's filming us . - That 's probably what he 's doing . - He 's somewhere laughing at us . While we sit here like idiots . Lingonberry ? - In the woods ? - Yes , with no food or water . - Cool ! - What ? It 's a night-vision camera . Listen ! That 's just him . One week , or being bitten by a bear . - It makes for a good story . - You would look ridiculous ! - So I think I 'll choose that . - Being bitten by a bear ? Do you feel that ? I 'm picking up some strange sounds . What is that ? Seriously . What 's going on ? What is this ? This is one real bad joke . It 's a Tosserlad ! Get the hell out of here ! Run , dammit ! - Did you see that ? - Yes . Where did it go ? Do you see it ? Get behind my car ! No ! - Give me the camera ! - No ! Where is Johanna ? Thomas ! Kalle ! - Johanna ! - It 's real ! I told you so ! I knew it ! They are real ! - Say something . - It 's been turned to stone ! We ran through the woods ... Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian ? The way that troll sniffed around ... Obviously one of you believes in God . I don 't believe in God . I sang in a church teen choir ... But that 's because my parents forced me to . I don 't believe in God . I 'm serious . - I can tell it 's not her . - What ? How ? Knock it off . That was some genetically-engineered monster . - That 's a troll . - Nonsense ! Question ! Why doesn 't anybody know about this ? Because someone doesn 't want people to know . The government ? Is the government behind this ? Do you work for them ? - Why show it to us now ? - Because I 'm tired of this shitty job . I have no rights whatsoever . I get no night bonus . No overtime . No nuisance compensation . Maybe it 's time for a change in troll management . - So if you could get this on TV ... - That shouldn 't be a problem . Come on . You want to see more of these , learn what 's really going on ? You might want to step back . Holy shit ! Anyone need some gravel ? Who the hell is that ? - Who is that ? - I don 't know . Hi there . It 's that guy we filmed ... What is this , Hans ? A film crew ? They wanted to see some trolls . Aren 't you that guy from the Wildlife Board ? This is an exceptionally bad idea . Turn off that camera . I have enough problems . The valley is full of dead cattle . I can 't talk about this on film . Turn off that camera . - Put it down . - We 're allowed to film here . - Sure you 're on top of this ? - Totally . As soon as the scapegoat arrives , I will take care of the rest . PIO TER 'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE The Ringlefinch is still out there . Then find it ! Two German tourists disappeared last night . - We expect to lose a few more . - That isn 't my problem . If you think I 'll let you keep those recordings , you 're wrong ! It says " Pioter 's Polish Paint Service " . What exactly is your job description ? My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory - and comes near people . - How often do they break out ? Rarely . This is a special situation . Too many trolls are out and about . Finn is a ... bureaucrat . He works for TSS . His primary job is to prevent ... To keep people from knowing that trolls exist . In one sense , you are a true Norwegian hero . No , you 're wrong about that . There 's nothing heroic about what I do . It 's dirty work . How can no one know about this ? Let 's take these recordings , drive to Oslo , and sell them for a fortune . We can 't do that yet . We have to keep following him . Finn is pissed off . - Now what ? - Breakfast . - You should eat something too . - I 'm not hungry . I feel a little ... nauseous . How many types of troll are there ? You have two main groups : mountain trolls and woodland trolls . The subgroups include Ringlefinch , Tosserlad , Rimetosser . Mountain Kings . The Harding , out west . But that troll we saw ... Do they all have three heads ? No , there are many variations . The heads develop as they age . They aren 't born with three . They are usually born with one . The others appear later . They only have an eye in the middle , the original , head . The other heads aren 't really heads . They 're a sort of protuberance . Their function is to scare other trolls . Or impress the females . What is that form ? - What does TSS stand for ? - Troll Security Service . We have to fill out this form after each kill . Location , gender , whether it blew up or turned to stone ... SLAYED TROLL FORM In fairy tales , trolls wear clothes and talk like people . - They 're just like people . - Fairy tales are for kids . Trolls are animals . Predators . They eat , shit and mate . Eat anything they can . - How old can trolls get ? - 1000 , 1200 years . - And their intelligence level ? - In the pits . They are not bright . They manage to eat . But how hard is it to survive on rocks ? I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail . His head between his legs , he tried to suck down his own tail . He started gagging on it , tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel . - I was a Navy Ranger . - And that led you to troll hunting ? No , they were looking for someone who could ... - So you 're the only one in Norway ? - Yes . Are we leaving ? - They eat all sorts of crap . - Do they eat people ? - You want to offer yourself ? - No . But have they eaten people ? - Are those troll tails ? - Yes . Some skinned , some whole . - Why ? - So it smells like troll in here . Why do you want a troll smell ? So I can approach the trolls without them noticing . - Tanning lamps ? - Yes . - You can get skin cancer . - I use sunscreen . I have trouble sleeping in the dark . - Is that what we rubbed on ourselves ? - Yes . - What is it ? - Concentrated troll stench . A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll . Let 's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county . Two German tourists were found killed by a bear . Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy . Do you know where the troll might be ? No . What are you looking for ? Rock slides , toppled trees , things like that . See anything ? - Do I look like that famous painting ? - Yeah . Maybe you should see a doctor ? - Do you really feel sick ? - It comes and goes . - Are we safe here ? - They only come out at night . Kalle , can 't we ... It hasn 't been triggered . Some small trolls have taken the bait . Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination . - Do it now ! - Now ? Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch ... Hans thinks he has found tracks . Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby . Hans thinks there 's a link between the two . Hurry up ! Global warming has led to changes in our flora and fauna . These tracks you see around here ... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden . The bear stores its food here under the bridge . - Isn 't that strange behavior ? - Not for Russian bears . Due to the long , hard winters , they store their food . Just like squirrels . Aren 't these tracks a little strange ? That 's the left foot . And the right foot is over here . Has the bear walked cross-legged ? I assume you have seen bear tracks before . Hey , what about those tracks ? He 's gnawed at the bark . Typical Ringlefinch behavior . He 'll be back tonight . I have something to lure him with . - And then you 'll kill him ? - Yes . But first , I need to get that blood sample . Is this the syringe ? This is horrible ! It 's cruelty to animals . Cruelty ? He 's just using them as bait . You 're too far away . Move closer . No , I 'll just zoom . We can see fine from here . What working hours ... We 've been here forever . Maybe no troll will show up ? - We can see fine from here . - But we can see better from there ! Come on . It 's here . Hear that ? Run ! God , I hate this crap ! Keep your distance . I 'm about to toss out some Christian man 's blood . Move back ! Shit ! Kalle ! Thomas ! Move ! Move over ! Are you alright ? Hey ... Are you alright ? Help him up . - Come on , Hans . - Are you alright ? Careful with that red button . Give me the syringe . Stay up there . Now we know that trolls also explode . - How are you doing ? - Fine , thanks . Could 've been worse . Just a little sore . A little sore ? This is crazy ! At least I got the blood sample . I 'll be there in a half hour . Thanks . Bye . You look like a newborn ! It 's just a film team . They have some questions . ARDAL PET CLINIC - Is that the blood ? - Yes . - It was quite a struggle . - I can tell . You 're a mess ! - Thanks . - There 's a bathroom in there . - What do you see ? - There aren 't enough red blood cells . This will take me a couple of days . Could we have a short interview ? If you could just stand ... or maybe sit over there . - What should I tell them ? - Everything . - We aren 't allowed . - I take full responsibility . The trolls ' main problem is that they can 't convert vitamin D from the sunlight , into calcium . So when they are exposed to bright sunlight , their bodies overreact . Their stomachs expand . Gases are forced into their intestines and veins . This becomes unbearable . - And they explode ? - They explode . - But some trolls turn to stone . - Yes , the older ones . Their veins are too constricted , so the expansion occurs in their bones . In a matter of seconds , everything calcifies and they turn to stone . I wish they didn 't have to experience such pain . It is traumatic for them , even though it only takes a few seconds . We would have preferred to give them an injection . - I 'll have the results in a few days . - And you 'll call me ? - Bye . - Bye . - Ready to go ? - Sure . - Why all these local newspapers ? - To collect information . - About what ? - Trolls . Accidents and things that have happened , that trolls are behind . - I have files back there . - Can I take a look ? - " Road disappeared . " - People want natural explanations . But if you know what to look for , you 'll see what 's caused by trolls . This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head . Are there trolls that big ? Yes , the Jotnar . I 'm the only person to have seen one . There 's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau . And one on the Hardanger plateau . Three in Jotunheimen , one in Dovre . We have to find out where the problem lies . Jotunheimen is closest . We are on our way to the first territory Hans wants to check . At the moment , we are circling around the territory . The territory ends up here , and because this tire is intact ... Hans says no trolls have left this territory . If they had left , they would have gnawed on this tire . Smile ! Film over there . Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires . One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here , but failed . - How many trolls are there ? - Impossible to say . You must have some idea ? The gestation period is 10 to 15 years . And they only have one kid . - Are they mammals ? - Yes . Let 's see ... One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . This looks fine . All the stones are in the same position . This is apparently a battle area . Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here . They throw stones at each other . But there has been little activity here lately . The guy behind us is paying . Isn 't that what they say ? Remember that big Jotnar ? They live here in Jotunheimen . - Where ? - Inside the mountains . - What are we doing ? - Just wait here . I ate an entire loaf of bread . Finn refuses to give in . He claims all the runaways are from Dovre . Because he doesn 't see any in this satellite photo . But you can 't see trolls in satellite photos ! Let 's get to the bottom of this . We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently . Hans thinks it 's troll related . Wow , look at that ! Did you get that ? - What happened here ? - A tornado . - Did you see it happen ? - No . Look at the position of those trees . They should all point in the same direction . Who showed you that map ? They didn 't say who they were . But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images . And we saw what looked like a tornado . At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward . How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this ? We 'll come back tonight . Head into the woods . I 'm tired . - I don 't like this . - Let 's stick together . Seriously , Kalle . We have to follow him . What do you think we should do ? There are tracks further in . Here 's their trail . They 've passed through here . - We can 't stay here alone . - This way ! An abandoned mine . - They 've been here . - I 'm not going in there ! There aren 't any trolls there now . Come on . - Are you sure ? - Sure . No , there 's nobody home . I need the troll stench . - Here . - I can take the camera . Everything okay ? A whole pack of trolls lives here . This is a lair . - We can leave . - Come on , let 's get out of here ! Let 's go . Come on ! I 'm coming ! Closer to the wall ! Head back inside ! Quick , in here ! Turn off your flashlights ! I have to get out of here . - Do you have any more troll stench ? - No , not here . Just relax . Breathe easy . Calm down . - Why are you so nervous ? - I 'm Christian ! - We 're going to die ! - Damn ! You 'd better not start sweating ! Dear Lord ... Shut up ! Run ! Sunlight ! It still works . There are more in there . I 'll have to get them later . Mountain Kings . Why didn 't he just say he was Christian ? I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away . I can give you a ride down , if you want to quit . - What are you doing ? - Looking for those tapes . In my trailer ? - Are you filming ? - No . - It 's out of control . - Why aren 't you up there ? I refuse to go into their territory . There 's no way . - Turn off that camera . - It 's off . But don 't people have a right to know ? - What is your job ? - That 's confidential information . Why don 't we have a right to know ? People are dying ! Why is this so secret ? - People have a right to know . - No . - Hands off the camera . - This is none of your business . Yes , this happens to be my business ! - Get lost ! - This isn 't over . I 'm going to check it out . Do you want to join me ? - Yes . - Are you ready for that ? - Yes . - Okay , let 's keep on filming . Let 's find a new camera and continue . Here comes our new camerawoman . Malica . - Malica . - Thomas . You are not Christian . - You don 't believe in Jesus or God ? - I 'm a Muslim . Excellent . Muslim is okay , right ? I honestly don 't know . We 'll see what happens . - It must be okay . - We 're filming musk oxen , right ? No , not exactly . - Let 's go . - Yes , we might as well . We 'll explain on the way . - Where have you worked ? - Norwegian TV , BBC ... - I just filmed some lions in Tanzania . - Lions . Good . I 've never seen anything like this . Holy shit . They 've broken every single tree over several acres . I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here . A giant , over 200 feet tall , has chased the Dovre trolls down here . We don 't want Jotnars running around . Give me a break . Do you all actually believe in trolls ? You think a squirrel rampaged through here ? If only the trolls were happy . But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything . Those may look like normal power lines , but they 're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay . I don 't know how they broke through . I 'll have to check . Let 's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid . - Do they know about the trolls ? - No way . Have you had any problems up in Dovre ? Yes , you could say that . You can hang your coats here . Over here . Several hundred meters of power line , knocked to the ground . 300,000 volts . - When did this happen ? - Three weeks ago . - Do you know how it happened ? - No . No one does . Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes . We have no clue . - Is this a school project ? - Yes . Volda College . - Are you a teacher ? - No . Where does that line go ? It runs from here ... then north , in a loop , and back to here . - So it runs in a circle ? - Yes , exactly . You don 't find that strange ? Maybe a little . - Yes , it is strange . - The power leads to nowhere . Well , it does lead in a circle . And in a beautiful landscape . If a Jotnar runs through a power line , something is seriously wrong . I 'd better get up there and try to find it . The territory starts there . It 's hell to put up new pylons . Activists and farmers always complain . I think they 're pretty . Those were placed out here as food for trolls . This is the territory . We have been here . And here . And no sign of trolls . I think we should try this area next . There 's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait . Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena , while others more than 1000 quakes registered ... We are in a troll territory now . You don 't seem to like entering these territories . Is there some particular reason ? There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell . Back in the ' 70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area . Both the TSS and I tried to object , but to no avail . I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls . Every last one . Pregnant females . Kids . Newborns that hadn 't even learned to walk . It was a massacre . Hans ' entire life has revolved around trolls . Every day has been a struggle with and for trolls . In many ways , he is a superhero here in Norway . What would we have done without him ? That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie . My shoulder . Are you alright ? The sun will be up in an hour . Should we go too ? He sounds a bit big , but I 'll give it a shot . It sounds like he 's snapped completely . This could be problematic . Your phone is ringing , Hans . - Where is it ? - On my seat . Thomas speaking . He 's a little busy right now . Can I ... Rabies ? - That Ringlefinch had rabies . - Let me talk to Hilde . Hi Hilde . Are you sure ? That makes sense . Okay . You take care too . Bye . I 'll bet all the trolls we 've met had rabies . This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings . - And even to you , Thomas . - Me ? I don 't have rabies . Hello ! Dogs have rabies . If you have rabies , you have to get to a hospital . If you think he has rabies , he needs medical attention ! I don 't have rabies . You can 't just say I have rabies ! If so , we need a hospital now ! - That beast is on its way . Get inside ! - I couldn 't care less ! - We can 't stay in here . - Look ! Is it coming this way ? Go outside ? Are you crazy ? He 's leaving ! Don 't move ! I 'll try to lure him this way . What a friend we have in Jesus ... What is he doing ? What 's happening ? The flash ran out of power . Definitely rabies . Can we go to the hospital now ? - No , he needs a few more doses . - What are you talking about ? But first I have to wear him out . He 's closing in on us ! - Now we 're getting away ! - Good . - There 's somebody up ahead ! - Stop , Hans ! - Get in ! - Hurry , dammit ! Go ! Go ! - Where are you going ? - Stay here ! - Hans ! - Get back inside ! Oh my God ! Get back in the car ! - Who are you ? - A seismologist . I have to get in front of him . Look out ! Is it on ? Hans , what are you doing ? I have to give him the finishing blow ! - With that ? - Yes . I hope you have all the footage you need . This road will lead you to the highway . There 's no more roaring ! Malica ... Stop fooling around . That 's troll on tape . Here is the footage . Am I bleeding ? What did you say ? - Are you okay ? - Sure , I 'm fine . Look ! Over there ! Isn 't that Finn and the others ? Shit , it 's Finn . Give me the camera ! Thomas , what are you doing ? The recordings end here . No body was ever found in the mine and the teenagers behind the recordings have vanished without a trace . We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station . It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service . However , an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg 's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25 , 2010 . The press didn 't get the point . We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can . Few people find power grids attractive . I certainly don 't . Norwegians are pro electricity , but against power lines . That won 't work in the long run . Norway has trolls , so more power lines are needed . - That 's just the way it is . - That 's a wrap !

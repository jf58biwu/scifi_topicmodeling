 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . Are we done ? We 'll never be done . You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . You think I don 't know that ? Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? We 're not safe , are we ? - They 're coming ! - Who 's coming ? Lucian Alliance . They 're coming to take Destiny . There 's only one way this is going to end if we wait . I 'm not surrendering this ship . Chloe , what are you doing in here ? I don 't know how I got here . There may be something happening to Chloe on a cellular level . Some kind of genetic manipulation gradually changing her . What were you doing ? He wanted me to look at some equations , see if I understood them . Did you ? I don 't know . So , the chair kills off any potential alien matter inside her while leaving her human side unaffected . She 's breathing and her pulse is steady . Did it work ? We 'll soon find out , won 't we ? I think it 's , uh , right over there . Yeah , I can see it . We 're comin ' into town . How can you tell ? Hey , it beats the hell out of our digs in Kandahar , don 't it ? I wouldn 't miss it for the world , brother . Well , I appreciate it . I do . Cloverdale ! Me first ! Damn , I thought my dad might be here . There they are . Hey , guys ! He 's coming to again ! T.J. , just cut it off me , please ! Try something else ! I 've tried everything in my bag . Nothing is working . The best thing for him is to keep moving . Matthew ... Matthew ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? Sorry ! I 'm sorry , he just ran out in front of me ! No , I 'm fine . I 'm fine , I 'm fine ... Thank God . Lucky for you . No , no , no , I was just being stupid . Look , Mr. Brody , don 't worry about it . They bounce at this age . Okay . Hey , are we still on for the , uh- - Yeah , yeah , go . We 're takin ' up the whole road here , guys . If you wind up with any insurance issues , Matt , I got it all on video . I kind of wish you didn 't , Eli . So you , uh , you must be Ronald . Oh , dad , sorry , this is Ron , my best man . Pleasure to meet you , sir . Oh , you call me Everett . You 're family now . Yes , sir- - and this is Chloe 's brother Eli . Brother Elijah . Eli , actually . And I took myself out of the running for best man because I 'm creating a video for my wedding gift . Lucky for me . Where 's Chloe ? Uh ... Something about a dress . She 's going to meet you at the house . I guess I 'm anxious to see her . I 'll say , nearly got yourself killed the day before your wedding . Yeah , probably would 've ruined the whole weekend , huh ? Yeah , probably , but I guess since it looks like you 're gonna live for another day , Welcome home , son . Stargate Universe 2x05 Cloverdale Original Air Date on October 26 , 2010 Okay , he 's out again . Guys , we can move him . You 'll be able to help him once we 're back on the ship , right ? We can 't risk taking him aboard . It 's too dangerous . What ? Rush is right . You saw how quickly the organism spreads on contact . It could take over the whole ship . He can 't stay here either . Chloe . Ready ? One , two , three . I got you , buddy . Come on , come on , move your feet , Eli . Come on- - Okay ! I 'll run ahead , contact Destiny , try to get them to send back medical supplies . If I 'm fast , I 'll get back before you reach the gate , okay ? Yeah , yeah , good . Go . Eli ... Yeah . Remote . Yeah . Okay . Wow . Aw , this hasn 't changed one bit . Matt is clearly moved seeing the old homestead again . What 's that ? A temp track for the voice-over . All good documentaries have one . I 'm thinking Kiefer Sutherland , but I 'm the fallback . Ronald , make yourself at home . Let me grab that . You 're going to be up in Matthew 's room . You 're in my room . I 'll be fine on the couch in the den . You 're the one with the fiancee . That 's gonna be weird . Like that 'll stop you . Okay , so , uh ... So , what 's the plan ? I say , you get married , you start a family , you grow old , and die happy . Okay , well , I thought you guys might , uh ... What ? I don 't know , throw a party maybe ? Was I supposed to do that ? No , no . Yeah . No , uh , Chloe said she wanted you all to herself tonight . Yeah , yeah , she said something about wanting to catch the early show at the Clova . Really ? Yeah , that 's what I said . Well , we could see a movie any night . What are you doing right there ? What , you don 't want to see a movie with your fiancee ? He 'd better ! Video boy . Kiefer Sutherland might have somethin ' to say over here . I 'm so sorry I couldn 't be there to meet you . The train was too long after I changed my shoes . Uh ... okay . Matt , what did you do to your arm ? Oh , I got hit by a car . What ? I 'm fine . Are you sure ? Baby , you don 't look so good . Matt ? Time 's an issue , I get it . What do you need ? Lieutenant Johansen 's medicinals . One of everything you can get your hands on , but especially the alien venom . Nothing she 's tried so far has had any effect . Okay , what else ? I want to try hydrochloric acid . We need some alcohol from the still , clean bandages ... And whatever 's appropriate for cutting through bone . It 's as bad as that . Yeah . Put it on Eli 's kino sled and get it through as quickly as you can . What happened ? You fainted . I got it on video if you want to- - No thanks , Eli . Why the heck would I faint ? You did just get hit by a car . Ronald said you haven 't eaten all day . Here . No , I don 't think that 's it , honey . Now , you listen to me . You 're one day away from being out of here . You 're fine , all right ? Go to a movie with your girlfriend . You enjoy yourself . We 'll leave the lights on . Okay ? You 're going to hate the cake . Would you stop worrying so much about one day ? Think about all the days after that . Okay . Okay ? Okay ! Remember the first time we came here ? Yeah . That 's why we came here , isn 't it ? Yup . It 's so beautiful ... Whoa , this is ... What ? It 's like an ocean of flowers . This doesn 't look familiar to you ? Shh ! Shh ! It goes on forever , doesn 't it ? Yeah . Did you see that ? Yeah . Watch this . Get out of there . Don 't you just want to run through it barefoot ? Yeah . It would be so beautiful . Would you relax ? Maybe not . Whoa ... I 'm sorry ... Matthew ... What is wrong with you ? You don 't remember any of that actually happening ? No . It 's a movie . No , I 'm ... I 'm sorry , I ... I-I don 't know what 's wrong with me . I ... can we just get out of here ? Hang on , I left my purse . And what was that about ? I have no idea . Look , I can stall for a while , but you 'll have to let them know we 're going to be early . Okay , thanks . Wake up ! You 've got to wake up ! Wake up . You 've got to wake up ! Hurry , let 's unpack the supplies and get him on the sled . What did you ask for ? Everything I could think of . The venom was top of the list . All right , I 'll try it first . Has it spread beyond the arm ? No , not yet . Good . I know . Did something happen to you over there that you want to talk about ? No , no , that was just some kind of weird deja vu . I 'm over it now . Hey , you want to go to Mr. Brody 's for a bite ? Now ? Matthew Scott ! Hey , Mr. Volker ! Dale , please . I 'm your pharmacist , for God 's sake . So you 're back home . No one ... No one tells me these things . We 're getting married this weekend . Right ! Yes , I-I did hear something about that . Wow ! That must be ... It is . Yeah , I bet it is . I bet it is ... Good ... Good , so , uh ... What are you up to ? Uh , on our way to Brody 's , but , uh , I don 't think they 're open yet , do you ? Uh , why don 't we find out ? No , it 's no problem , no problem . Adam ! Hey , guess who I just bumped into ? Matthew Scott and ... That 's right . Yeah , hey , listen , they were wondering if you were ... Just opened . Perfect . Well , we 'll see you in a few minutes- - they will- - them- - th- - they 'll see you . Good . Well , they 're all there . The staff 's all there . The , uh , waiters and ... So ... Well , you 're good to go . Slow night , huh ? Oh , no , place is packed . Everyone 's hiding . What ? Surprise ! You are a lot of work . Oh , you couldn 't sit through one damn movie , huh ? I almost blew it , didn 't I ? Mr. Volker was stalling . I 'm such an idiot ! Yes , you are , but my work is done . I have delivered you to your bachelor party . Better early than never . Well done . If he is hung over in the morning- - No , no , no , we got it . Everything 's- - nothing to worry about . Listen , if you 're not hung-over I will be very disappointed . Here 's a toast to my son , to my boy who is getting hitched ! What 's that supposed to do ? Hopefully dull the pain . It 's still spreading towards us . Probably following the vibrations of our movement . Anything ? The venom had no effect . That 's disappointing . It didn 't even react to the acid . I tried everything you brought back . It 's like this thing is indestructible . Well , you know what you have to do . No . No- - - I know it looks extreme- - - no , he wouldn 't want that- - any rational person would give up a limb if it meant saving their life . Hey , if we wait too long , and it spreads to the rest of his body ? Those things are still comin ' this way . The leading edge is on the other side of those trees . Okay , that gives us roughly 15 minutes . 10 . Is that enough time ? No . We 're almost to the gate . We 'll do it there . Whoo ! Whoo-whoo ! Hey . Brody ! Brody , Brody , what- - what is this ? What 's with this music ? What 's wrong with it ? What 's wrong with it ? It sounds like an animal dying . Best man chooses the music . I am the best man . Oh , this is the man here ? This is your fault ? Sir , I 've been called a good man , a strong man- - An angry man- - hey . But ain 't never been called a " best man " until now , huh ? Now , groom . " Groom . " What is that ? Oh , God , that 's me ... Last call , guys ! Oh , come on , Vaness . Come on , night 's Young . That 's it , keep ' em comin ' . I think you are cut off . That is not the first time you 've told me that , if you catch my drift . Let 's not forget who dumped who , Matt- - An awkward moment with Matt 's ex ... Are you flirting with me the night before your wedding ? Hey , I still got a whole 19 hours of freedom left . Okay . Well , then , let 's go . Right now . We 'll drive somewhere , and we 'll never come back . Whoa ... Okay , come on , Vanessa . I was- - I was just kidding . Yeah . That 's what I thought . Erase that . Okay , all right . You honestly weren 't planning on driving , were you ? Well , not now . For God 's sakes , Everett , tomorrow 's an important day . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . No , it 's true . You got him ? Yeah , I got him . Are we being arrested ? Just a friendly ride hom call it a wedding present . So how was it over there ? Boring . He just means we didn 't see any action . So , what 's wrong with that ? What 's wrong with that ? It 's a waste of ability . You 're that good , huh ? Well , don 't take this the wrong way , sergeant , but guys like you usually get themselves killed . Guys like me ? David , come on , why do you always got to start a fight ? It 's a conversation- - hey , you guys ever wonder what 's real ? Because ever- - ever since I got home , I keep thinking I 'm someone else . Like , I 'm- - I 'm not myself . Alcohol can have that effect- - no , I don 't really drink . I can see that . Oh , Chloe 's gonna kill me . She 'll get over it . Go to sleep , all right ? Yeah , go ahead , close your eyes . But I 'm sorry to tell you that , when you wake up , you 're gonna feel guilty for things you 've done or said . Some of it you won 't even remember . It 'll just be a blur , and you 're going to wonder if you 're ever going to feel like the person you used to be again . Matthew ? I think he 's out . I hope so . I don 't want him waking up in the middle of this . I need you to hold him still . Oh , God , I can 't watch- - you don 't have to . Take his feet . Hold tight . Hold his arm ? Have you done this before ? No . Ready ? Wait , wait , stop , stop . What ? Look at the color . It 's in his bloodstream . No point in dismembering him . Not if it 's spreading internally . Damn it ! So , what do we do now ? We 've got three hours before the ship goes into ftl- - no , sergeant- so let 's keep at it- - - there 's no- - we can still win this- - this is an enemy you can 't fight . Watch me . Three hours . That 's the clock- - not really . He means we 're gonna be overrun by the organism in less than an hour , Greer . Are there any planets in range ? One , but it 's locked out . I guess it 's more dangerous than this place . Dial the ship . No , we can 't take him back to Destiny . We 've already been through this- - I know that ! I need some things . Matt ? Why did you drink so much ? Isn 't that what you 're supposed to do at a bachelor party ? That 's why you do things , because you 're supposed to ? Sometimes . Is that why you 're getting married ? What ? No ! Why would you say that ? So you 're not just coming back from war to marry your high school sweetheart because you 're supposed to ? Because you think it 's the right thing to do ? Uh ... Wow . You really should know the answer faster than that , Matt- - Chloe , this isn 't fair . My brain isn 't working . Well , it had better start working . This is your wedding day . You have to talk to the justice of the peace at 10 : 00 about our vows- - I know . You have to pick up your tuxedos . I know . Chloe ... I really , really have to pee . So we 're ruling out quarantine ? Well , it 's not up to me to rule out anything , but we have to consider the possibility that Lieutenant Scott 's infection is how this organism reproduces . It 's already spread to his blood . Still , there must be precautions . Against what ? We have no idea what the next stage of infection entails . Even if we were to manage to move him from the gateroom into quarantine , it 's just a matter of time before the infected area would burst open and release microscopic spores into the ship 's air . All we would have to do is breathe it in and the same thing that 's happening to Scott could happen to all of us from the inside out . Yeah , but you can 't say that for sure . But we have to assume that this thing has infected Scott in order to spread . One way or another . It 's what virulent , aggressive organisms do . We can 't invite it aboard . Okay . Look , um ... Please don 't put this all on me . I 'm not . Because he 's one of the nicest people on the ship , and I just would hate to be the one that 's resp- - Lisa , it 's my decision . As deep a ditch as you can dig . Then the barricade . Doesn 't have to be pretty , just quick ! Anything outside of that ... Is the kill zone . We gotta hold the gate for three hours . Sergeant , we 're sending a kino , see if we can get you some intel on this thing . Hello . Hi . I 'm Matt Scott . You 're marrying me tonight ? I- - I mean , me and my girlfriend- - i wasn 't confused . Come in . So , uh , I guess we just want to go with the usual . The usual ? Wedding vows . You know , " dearly beloved- - " I know what wedding vows are . I 'm sorry , I 'm ... I 'm not all here today . So ... To what do we owe this , um , partial presence ? Are you having doubts about what you 're entering into ? What , y-you ... You mean about marrying Chloe ? No , no , I love her . I 'm just a little hung over . Like father , like son . My dad is a great man . Anyway , we talked about it , me and Chloe , and we decided to go with the regular vows . They 're all good . Traditional vows it is . Um ... Is there anything else we need to talk about ? I don 't know . Is there ? I 've been having this feeling . I don 't know how to describe it- - something 's not quite right . Yes , yes . Something is definitely wrong here , and I ... To tell you the truth , I- - I think I 'm ... I think I 'm losin ' it . Have you spoken to your father ? Every time I try to say something , he tells me everything 's great , and I should just be happy . Ah , the sage advice of great men . But I can see it in his eyes . Oh , I am scared . Well , you know , I 'm not a great man , Matthew ... But I can tell you that fear , well , it 's just one of those things in this world that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you 're truly alive . And I can tell you that you 're alive until you 're dead . You are going to die , Matthew . We all will , eventually . Well ... Yeah . So , 7 : 00 , then ? The " dearly beloved " business . I 'll be there . Your whole self , please . What we can see above ground must only be a fraction of the whole organism . The bulk of it has to be like an enormous root system that extends outward from the flora , dormant until its prey gets close enough to get stung and survive just long enough to spread spores . I don 't even want to think of what it could do aboard ship . What do you think it is , plant , animal ? Maybe properties of both , like coral , except its growth rate smacks right up against the laws of thermodynamics . It spreads upon contact , and it resisted every chemical T.J. ' s exposed to it . Well , let 's hope it burns . Short bursts , gentlemen . Short bursts . T.J. , go to two . Yes , sir . Are you sure Lieutenant Scott is the only one who 's been infected ? Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . Well , I need you to be damn sure . I 'm going to need you to send non-combatants back to the ship . The last thing we need is a mad dash at the last minute . Understood , sir . T.J. , that means you , too . Sir , I 'd like to keep trying- - don 't make me come down there and get you . I 'm not willing to lose both of you . Young out . He 's dying , isn 't he ? How long ? I don 't know . He 's strong , so probably longer than we can stay . No , I 'm not leaving him . Chloe , I just got orders to send everybody but Greer 's team back to the ship , and that includes you . Tamara , I have a right to stay . No , you don 't ! I 'm not leaving ! Chloe ... Oh , my God . It doesn 't look like it touched your skin . How did it get there ? Maybe when Matt first cut the thing . It could have been a microscopic droplet for all we know . It grew right through the material . It 's a miracle you weren 't infected . Greer ! Over here . You 've got to be kidding me . Okay , listen up ! Everyone not on Sergeant Greer 's fire team is going back through the Stargate . Each of you needs to be checked for traces of the organism on your person before you go ! Eyes only . Use the buddy system , okay ? Eli , that means you . I 've been checking myself every 30 seconds . Just- - just give me a minute , okay ? Damn , we look good . Is that you or Kiefer talking ? Oh , I think Mr. Sutherland would agree . All right , they fit . It 's like the enthusiasm just explodes out of your face . Yeah , well , you did this to me . Go change . Listen , Matt . I can 't help but notice that something 's bothering you . Beyond the blood alcohol level . I 'm fine . I 'm just saying that we 've known each other a long time , and I can pretty much tell when something is- - what , you think you know me ? You 're not that deep . Look , nobody who knows you at all thinks of you as a one-girl guy . It 's not a criticism , okay ? It 's just- - it 's who you are . If you 're having cold feet , I think that- - no , listen , listen , I 'm going to marry Chloe , and we 're going to have a half-dozen kids , buy a house on my dad 's street . We 're going to renovate it together , play catch with the kids in the front yard , and go to Brody 's every friday night . You can videotape the whole dang thing . Well ... " A , " that 's a lot of tape . And " B , " I don 't think you believe that yourself . Are we done ? If- - if you can hear me , I just want you to know that nobody 's giving up on you . Whoo ! I mean , you should see Greer 's face . He 's taking no prisoners . You 'd better keep fighting , too . Eli ! Okay ? Eli ... I asked for one lousy minute- - where 's Chloe ? Chloe ? Chloe ! Chloe ! What happened ? Now I have to stay . No , you didn 't , did you ? It wasn 't that hard . It doesn 't even hurt that much- - Chloe , why would you do that ? They weren 't going to let me stay . Now they have no choice . But now you can 't come back ! She 's already made up her mind . Look , I 'm sorry , Eli , but I had to do this . Go have someone check you out . Hi . I 'm Tamara , I 'm a paramedic . Your friends called 911 . Why ? You were on the floor , man . Why ? A lot of things can cause a syncope episode , but you don 't have a fever . He was hit by a car yesterday . No , don 't listen to him . That was nothing . I just had a little too much to drink last night . You could be low on electrolytes . Awesome , let 's go with that . Okay , well , just to be safe , I 'm going to take him to the hospital- - no , no , no , I 'm getting married tonight , and I 'm gonna be there if they have to prop me up with a stick . Lucky girl . I just mean I 'll be fine . Up to you . Just do me a favor and have some chicken soup or something , okay ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Whoa . They don 't like that . Come on ! How about this , huh ? You want some of this , huh ? How about some of this ! Bye . Chloe ... Before I go , please tell me you didn 't do this to keep a dying boy company . The organism got on my clothes . I know it touched my skin , it had to . I should have been infected , but I wasn 't . So you decided to test if you were immune . And ? It doesn 't hurt . Matt was in agony by now . Lieutenant Johansen ... David ... Hey . Thank you for coming . Wouldn 't have missed it . How 's your boy doing ? Oh , he 's fantastic . You know , white as the plastic man on the cake , but that 's just nerves . Congratulations . Thank you . It 's true , I nearly killed him yesterday . Ran right over him . Oh , come on , I told you to keep that thing out of my face . Before the ceremony , Matt enjoys a hot bowl of soup and the camaraderie of his closest friends . Has my dad showed up yet ? He 's mingling . Good . Just make sure you get a shot of Chloe comin ' in . Right . Hey ... We can do this another day . There he is . How 's my boy ? You ready ? No . Wh-what do you mean , no ? I mean , I don 't know if I can do this . What if it doesn 't work out ? What if it 's wrong ? What ... What if I hurt her ? Well , you would never do that . We 're so different from each other . Can you give us a second ? Hey ... What do you want from me ? Just tell me the right thing to do . What , you think- - you think I know ? I 'm asking you , please , dad . Wake up . Wake up . Your blood looks normal to me . No , but it 's not normal . They changed me . You said the chair undid all that . Well , obviously she relapsed . The point is whatever they did to her , it 's given her immunity to this organism . Look . Look , I 'm already healing . A transfusion of Chloe 's blood could help save his life . And pass whatever the aliens did to her on to him . Well , I think that 's a bargain he 'd be willing to make , don 't you ? Dearly beloved ... We are gathered here in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in matrimony . It is not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly , but reverently , discreetly , advisedly , and solemnly . Marriage is the union of husband and wife in heart , body , and mind . It is intended for their mutual joy , and for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity . Through this union Matthew and Chloe make a commitment to embrace their dreams , realize their hopes , and to accept each other 's failings . We are here today to witness this occasion that marks the celebration of love and commitment with which this man and this woman begin their life together . If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together , then let them speak now or forever hold their peace . Damn things don 't want to burn . I 'm running out of fuel . His pulse is getting stronger . I just need a little more time . I can 't give it to you ! Please ! I know it 's working ! Sergeant ... Last time we dialed the gate , did you see how it reacted ? We just got to keep dialing over and over . It may buy us the time we need . Not we . Just me . This ramp is about to get crowded . I need you two to get out of here . Sergeant- - go , go ! Get out ! Go ! Do you , Matthew take Chloe to be your wife ? Will you love her , comfort her , honor and keep her in sickness and in health ... For richer , for poorer ... For better , for worse ... In sadness and in joy , and forsaking all others , keep yourself only unto her for as long as you both shall live ? He 's conscious . What the hell 's going on ? Stay down ! Oh , my God , his arm ! Are you okay ? Well , yeah , but- - Come on . Let 's go ! We 're okay , we 're okay ... Welcome home , son . Thank you , sir . I , uh , I don 't know how they did it , but- - Unfortunately , I do know . The three of you will undergo decontamination right away . Yes , sir . As for the two of you , you 'll be placed in quarantine indefinitely , until I decide what to do with you . Sir ? I 'll let Miss Armstrong explain .

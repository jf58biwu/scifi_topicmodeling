 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We have competition . MacPherson . Who ? Leena , I know him . He was Joshua 's physics Professor , Professor Reynolds . The Phoenix . Those who touch the Phoenix , they will be spared . What is it ? It looks like Claudia was the last one to have access to the Phoenix . The thimble . James MacPherson , you 're under arrest . We 'll put him in the bronze sector . What we do is we flash-freeze the bodies cryogenically , and we preserve them by bronzing . Something 's wrong . Turn around . Yes , ma 'am . Thank you for remembering our appointment . Artie ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait for us ! Artie ! Do you think there 's any way he could 've survived ? I don 't know . Quickly . We don 't have much time . Why ? Huh ? Why didn 't he wait for us ? What are we gonna do ? Top of my list , kill that son of a bitch MacPherson . Oh , my God . Pete . Pete , what is that ? I don 't know . Get back over here . It might be a- - no , I don 't- - I don 't think it is . Oh , my God . Are you getting a vibe ? A good one . So that 's how it works . Artie ! Artie ! Hey ! Ahh . Oh , my God , it 's really you . You scared the hell out of us . We thought for sure you were a goner . I 'm all right . I 'm fine . It 's just that I don 't know how- - I have never been so happy to see you . Thanks . Yeah . No , I 'm good . I 'm good . Oh , God . Yeah . I know . But , Artie , how could you possibly have survived ? The Phoenix . Wait a minute . If--if you use the Phoenix , that means someone 's got to die , right ? One of us ? But , Artie- - Pete ? No . No , no , no . Pete ! Pete ! Artie , do something . Just hang on . Artie ! Artie ! No , I 'm okay . No , I was choking . It 's dust or something . You 're okay . Yeah , just- - oh , God . Was I choking on you , Artie ? That 's--Ahh . Are you all right ? Artie , if it 's not Pete , then , um ... Mrs. Frederic ! Mrs. Frederic 's in there . Got to get her out . No , no , no . Artie , wait . Artie , wait ! What is that ? There . So it was Mrs. Frederic , then . I promised myself I wouldn 't cry . Did you have any trouble ? No . But I 'd recommend 24 hours isolation from light . I 'll contact you with instructions . Until then , you know what to do . Yes , I 'll take care of it all . Come on , old friend . We 've got a great deal to catch up on . Welcome to the future . Let 's change it , shall we ? ♪ Warehouse 13 2x01 ♪ Time Will Tell Original Air Date on July 6 , 2010 This is my fault . If I hadn 't used the Phoenix , then your driver would be alive , and ... Be ... I 'm sorry . We need you . Find Claudia . Joshua . MacPherson is playing the long game . Rewind it again . Again . No . I don 't want to watch any more of that . I mean , look , I don 't believe that Claudia would- - I mean , come on , Myka , that can 't be right . Look , I know it 's hard , Pete , but it 's right there in front of us . Okay , maybe MacPherson did do something to her , but she 's gone . She ran . Innocent people don 't run . Whoa . Leena , what 's wrong ? Are you okay ? Yes . I--it 's nothing . Leena , we got to replace that umbilicus . I cannot do those stairs 15 times a day . Listen , listen , listen , listen . Claudia popped up on the grid . Looks like she 's headed to Switzerland . Wait . Switzerland , why ? To CERN , it 's to CERN . It 's that nuclear research place where Joshua works . He is her only family . She 's got no place else left to go . And listen , if Claudia and Joshua are- - No . If they are both working for MacPherson- - No , no , she 's not . I know she 's not , and so do you , Artie . Pete , nobody wants to believe it , all right ? But that 's irrelevant . Now , look , while I 'm gone , I want both of you- - Wait , wait . You 're going to CERN now ? Yes , of course . Then we 're going with you . You bet your ass . No , absolutely not . You have to go over this place with a fine-toothed comb . MacPherson has had hours , hours of unfettered access , and God only knows ... What that man has done . So start in the bronze sector and retrace his steps , and maybe , maybe ... That will tell us where he is right now . Artie , just be careful , okay ? We don 't know much , but we know that MacPherson is out there , and ... He already killed you once . Yeah . I got to go . This thing is useless , okay ? I 'm getting nothing . The durational spectrometer only reads energy shadows from the last five hours . Aah ! You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I am now . Five hours ago , I would have screamed like a little girl . Pete ? Yeah ? Look at this . It looks like something heavy was dragged through here , something heavy and something bronze . So what , you think our Jimmy took a playdate ? If there 's a history log in here , we could look up ... There . This says that the debronze function was activated twice . Okay , so once for MacPherson , but who 's our mystery guest ? Well , let 's ... This place just gets more interesting every day . I don 't get it . Why H.G. Wells ? What does MacPherson want with him ? And all I can find on the bronze sector is a list of its residents , and H.G. Wells isn 't even on that list . Yeah , I mean , if that place is reserved for the worst of the worst , what is Wells even doing in there ? Maybe there 's a clue in one of Wells ' books , because our library is amazing . I know , first editions of everything that 's ever been printed . Does that include comic books ? Really ? That 's your first thought ? No , but you definitely wouldn 't like my first thought . You 're right . You know that my dad used to read me H.G. Wells when I was a kid ? Yep , nothing like a little war of the Worlds to put a toddler to sleep . You 've read War of the Worlds ? Uh , no , but I saw the movie . Tom Cruise was awesome . Oh , and Brando in Island of Dr. Moreau- - I could 've been a scientist . Great , great , now all we need is Angelina to do The Modern Utopia , and you 'll be all caught up . Yahtzee . It was broken into . What was ? The H.G. Wells Home Museum in London , three months ago . But interesting , nothing was taken . If you 're looking for something in H.G. Wells ' house and you can 't find it , why not ask H.G. Wells ? MacPherson used Claudia to gain access to Wells . You watch , we 're gonna find out she 's in the clear . Okay , let 's go . Whoa , go where ? To London . I got a vibe about this thing . I bet Wells is there . Let 's go to London . That 's what I 'm talking about . Joshua , thank God you 're there . Where are you ? That doesn 't look like , uh- - Listen to me , okay , you remember Professor Reynolds from college ? Yeah , of course . Okay , his real name is MacPherson . What ? What are you- - and he 's actually- - Miss , you about done there ? It 's really complicated . They 're gonna kick me off this thing in sec . But listen , if he tries to contact you , do not trust him , okay ? He 's a bad , bad guy . Maybe I am too . I don 't know . Claudia- - Claud , what--what- - what 's going on ? I 'll explain when I get there . Here ? You 're gonna come to CERN ? There 's no place else to go , okay ? I can 't go back to Artie , and I 'm not going back to the international house of nutjobs . Joshua , are you busy ? No , Dr. Lefevre , please , uh , come in . I know I sound crazy . I 'll see you soon . Love you . Uh , yeah , I love you too . Sorry , doctor . That 's , uh , my sister . Joshua , I 'm going to be raising your clearance level . I want your help removing some material from the lab . Of course . Yeah , doctor , anything you say . Doctor . ♪ ♪ So is H.G. Wells one of the Munsters ? This place is a dump . How do you not have jet lag ? Because I slept on the plane . I mean , how many times can you watch Marley Me ? It 's so sad . Right , let 's all gather round , shall we ? We 're going to get started . I told you we should 've had this place closed and locked down . No , no , that 'd be like shooting off a big flare- - " hey , H.G. , looky here , we 're waiting for you . " Oh , sorry . Sorry . Hi . Hello . Pete , we are working . Working it , okay ? You know how long it 's been ? Way too . There 's no reason for me not to get my groove on . Pete , look at this . Edward Prendick . I 'll bet junior high was fun for him , huh ? No , from The Island of Dr. Moreau . You would know him as Marlon Brando . H.G. Is here . The actual inspiration for the heat ray came from a tour of Big Ben I was given by her Majesty Victoria- - lovely woman , terrible breath . Well , you got to admit , this guy 's got some cojones . Pete , wait . All right , Wells , show 's over . I beg your pardon . Sorry , ma 'am . Government business ... United States Secret Service . Well , you don 't look like much of a threat to me , but if MacPherson wants you out , then we want you in . Now let 's go . How dare you ? Take your hands off me . You two , I thought you might be trouble , coming in late . Ma 'am , we apologize . No , we don 't . Yes , we do , Pete . He 's an impersonator . No , we don 't know that . The best place to hide is right out in the open . He has a fake mustache . All right ? Name 's Walter Frith . Americans . H.G. Wells died in 1946 . Myka , I am really vibing out here , okay ? And I don 't like it . Uh , ma 'am , can I speak with you outside , please ? Yes , I 'd like to speak with you . Oh ! Artie ? What the hell ? You 're fired . We 're really very sorry about this . You can come back tomorrow . Thank you . Yep , sorry , guys . Sorry , sorry . Thank you , thank you . Nice jacket . Hey , yeah , sorry about the mustache thing . It was--okay . Okay , so if nobody in this group signed in as Edward Prendick , that means that Wells must have come and gone already . All right , so maybe we can find out what he took . Hey , uh ... So , uh , what 'd you say to Mary Poppins , anyway ? Oh , I just told her that you were a mental patient who thought he was Wells ' long-lost boyfriend . No , you didn 't . Did you ? Nice . That 's not even funny . Do you think that he could still be using her somehow ? There 's my access of just of few moments ago . Let me just toggle back to see the last person . This place is my home . I would never do anything- - Claudia , I 'm sorry . I would never do anything to hurt any of you . That 's probably why they bronzed him- - Neanderthals . Yah ! Oh , oh , oh . Oh , man , no- - Oh , my God , I 'm so sorry . I didn 't think anyone was still here . I didn 't know it was you , and I 'm--I 'm sorry . No , no , no , I do beg your pardon . I seem to have left my notebook here . Yeah . We left in such a hurry . Right , yeah , that was- - that was kind of our fault , so I 'm really sorry . I 'll just come back- - no , no , no , no . Uh , let me help you out here . You know , hands across the water and all that . Well , that is very sweet of you . Some Americans really are quite nice . Well , for a Brit , you ain 't half bad yourself . What ? What ? If I had a Farnsworth , you easily could have called me . Why call when I can fly 5,000 miles in coach ? What did you hit me with ? Nothing . My hand . What are you doing here , anyway ? If I 'm some kind of freaky double Agent , I have to be- - okay , first , are you planning on running for the rest of your life ? Because that 's what it 's gonna take to get me off your back . I 'm sorry . I needed to see Joshua . I needed to see somebody who knows me . And second , why can 't you just trust me ? I 'm kind of smart . Maybe the two of us could figure this out . And I know you too , kiddo . So you--you think maybe I 'm not a double Agent . I think maybe I could take the risk . Don 't make me regret it . Okay . 'Cause I 'm not , you know ? We 'll see . Ah . That was not your hand . No , it wasn 't . Okay , first thing , we have to make sure Professor Reynolds hasn 't gotten to Joshua . I figure if he got to me , he might try to go for Josh- - MacPherson is Reynolds . Yeah , you already know that . I know I know it , but I didn 't really think about it , because when the position first came up at CERN , the Director mentioned the name Reynolds . No ! Yes . I didn 't know at the time that MacPherson was Reynolds . That 's what she meant by , " he 's playing the long game . " We have to get to CERN immediately . That 's what I 've been saying . I 'm , uh- - I 'm Pete , by the way . Helena . You know , I-I think our two countries might be able to work out their differences . I 'd say we 're well on our way to detente . Fill me in . Well , hello to you too . W-where are you ? Geneva . Fill me in . We 're--we 're in London . I told you to stay at the warehouse . Will there ever come a time when the two of you , anyone for that matter , does as they are told ? Artie , look , MacPherson debronzed H.G. Wells . What ? Wait . Is everything all right ? No , no . I got a really bad feeling . Pete ! Pete ! In here . Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually- - a woman ... A really hot woman , maybe , uh , good with a gun . Yeah , he left out the gun part . Okay , so , uh , H.G. Wells is actually a woman . I 'm gonna have to process this . Yeah , well , make it fast , will you ? And could you please be careful with that , okay ? It 's a Tesla , and up close it just might be- - lethal . I know all about it . I brought it to the warehouse . You what ? I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . Nikola Tesla and I met at the Chicago world fair in 1893 . Oh . You are rocking my world , lady . Perhaps you 'd like to tell me why you 're ransacking my home . Ransacking your home . Well , that has a distinctive ringtone to it . What does that mean ? Oh , oh , it 's , uh- - it 's an American expression that means ... " Gotcha . " ♪ " C " is for cookie ♪ ♪ that 's good enough for me ♪ I 'll take that . I 'd hate to have to hit a sweet , old Victorian lady . I , on the other hand , have no problem shooting one . ♪ Good enough for me ♪ ♪ oh , cookie , cookie , cookie ♪ ♪ starts with " c " ♪ You know , that was just rude . I thought English people were supposed to be polite . Why are you protecting James MacPherson ? He tried to kill the both of us , and believe me , he will turn on you . Don 't they all ? Who ? Men ... Eventually . Neanderthals . You know , for somebody who 's been unconscious for 100 years , you 've really held on to some anger . Not unconscious ... Just immobile . Oh , right . What ? You mean while you 're bronzed , you 're awake ? We didn 't know that . Offers a lady time to think . So what did you come here for ? Yeah , look , you either tell us what and where it is or watch us tear this whole place apart looking for it . Pull out the second drawer down on the right . Empty it out . Turn it over . Pull open the panel on the back . What 's this ? Go over to the bottom set of shutters . Grasp the top inner vents on each side and close them simultaneously . UN , deux , trois . Et voila . That will show you the hiding place Mr. MacPherson had so much trouble locating . Here we go . Oh ! " Put the candle back . " Young Frankenstein . Never mind . Okay , just keep her covered , Pete . So do you want to tell us about this ? It 's a family heirloom . Right . Why did MacPherson want it ? I have no idea . Pete , the--the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch . Yeah , the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch . That has nothing to do with the vest . Oh , of course we believe you . Yeah , right . Why wouldn 't we ? You want to do the honors ? I do . Oh , what the hell ? Thank goodness these things haven 't changed much . How come you 're not affected ? Oh , magnetic boots ... Specially made . That explains why my head still hurts . I guess we know now why they bronzed you . Don 't speculate upon things about which you know nothing . Ooh , there 's that anger again . Well , there must be some reason why they bronzed you . The world was a different place . A century ago , it was easier to believe in the possibility of a time machine than in the reality that a woman thought one up . Well , if you wrote those novels , then--then who was H.G. Wells ? My brother Charles was the writer . I supplied the ideas , the research . Charles supplied the mustache . Oh , hey , I 'm , uh , digging the iron vest , by the way . It really brings out your eyes . Who 's angry now ? So do , uh , all your dates work out this way ? On a scale of one to ten , I 'm giving this one a seven . Is this Joshua 's department ? The antimatter storage facility is part of this building somewhere . I just--I don 't know where . This place is huge . Josh ! Joshua ! Claud--Claudia . Wait a minute . What ? I 'm a what ? Claudia ! Get off me . Joshua , are you all right ? Claudia , what 's happening ? Joshua , give me the briefcase . Claudia , his hand . Look at his hand ! Thanks for all your help . Joshua ! Joshua ! I 'll admit it , I thought she was hot , but she 's also obviously a- - Cavorite . Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure she was that too . No , Cavorite was- - was an anti-gravity metal that Wells wrote about , but Cavorite doesn 't exist . I mean , there 's no such thing . Myka , in this job there 's no such thing as no such thing . We just met the female H.G. Wells , for crying out loud . Good point . So how do we shut down Cavorite ? Maybe she ran some sort of electric current through it to increase its properties . Right . What the hell , then ? What ? What are you doing ? I 'm fighting fire with fire . What ? If I can just ram the Tesla into this- - hold on . Or--or--or don 't . That 's a high ceiling . Yeah . Artie . We have a problem . Yeah , Artie , so do we . She got away . Yeah , she took off in this- - I don 't know- - cool , iron , steampunky vest thing . It looked more like an artifact than a fashion choice . He 's fine . He 's fine . Come here . Come here . Hack in . Run a search on H.G. Wells ' inventions , specifically those not in the warehouse . On it . Now listen- - Artie , is that Claudia ? Is she okay ? Where did you find her ? Guys , I 'm okay . Joshua broke his leg . Everybody stop ! Bigger fish . Now , did you actually talk to H.G. Wells ? What is she up to ? She ? Later ! She really wasn 't very talkative . Artie , did you know that when you 're bronzed , you can still think ? Yes . All right , check it . The Imperceptor Vest . Wearer can move fast enough to be imperceptible to the naked eye . I don 't know . She had it on . Nothing happened . I would 've thought she 'd have used it . Well , is it operational ? Accor--according to the schematics , it needs a small but very powerful energy source . Which wouldn 't have existed 100 years ago . She probably could find one now . Yeah . Like , for instance , antimatter . I still don 't understand why she needs the vest . The Escher vault . That 's why they need the antimatter , to power the vest to get through the Escher vault . And what is the Escher vault ? It 's where the personal effects are kept of anyone who 's been bronzed . And to get through that , she would need something like the imperceptor . So where 's the vault ? It 's in the warehouse . They 're going back to the warehouse . He knew we would follow him . He wants the warehouse empty . You stupid- - Artie , if Claudia 's not the breach , and it 's obvious that you don 't think she is , then that leaves only- - Leena . Mrs. Frederic ... You 're here . So it would appear . Are you all right ? I thought you were supposed to be in the hospital . When the explosion happened , where were you exactly ? I was at the warehouse . You don 't remember . You 've been having lapses ... Blackouts ? Sometimes you even wake up in a different place . How do you know that ? Look at me . What was that ? As I suspected . Drink this . Not too much . What is it ? Absinthe . You tried to kill me . Yeah , sorry about that , but I had no choice . There 's no other way to remove the pearl . The pearl ? What are you- - what are you talking about ? The pearl of wisdom . MacPherson must have planted it in your inner ear weeks ago . Do you recall a night when you had bad dreams ? Yes ... Yes , over a month ago , horrible nightmares . That was the pearl attaching itself . If a person uses it properly , they can control your thoughts and movements . No , but the tape . It was Claudia who debronzed MacPherson . Think . See it clearly now . Harriet Tubman 's thimble . It was me ? Mrs. Frederic , it was me . It 's done . Why are you wearing those beads ? Well , if I remove them , my blood will eat through my own veins . Little gift from an old friend . We have to assume they 're not too far behind us . Not to worry . I 've created a few diversions , just in case . There . The antimatter 's attached . Let 's see if this works or if it kills me , shall we ? Oh . Behind you . Oh . I 'm impressed . I 'm so pleased it didn 't kill you . That seemed very easy . Well , access to the Escher vault is not the issue . 20 years ago , a curious Agent entered the vault and hasn 't been heard of since . I do hope you don 't run into him . We 're taking the long way around . MacPherson will expect us to take the most direct route . How 'd we beat Pete and Myka back ? Something to do with the destruction of historical landmarks- - I spoke to Scotland Yard . Anyway , you left the packet out for them , right ? On your desk . Why do MacPherson and Wells need the vest ? Because the Escher vault is a maze of stairs and walkways , constantly rapidly moving . If you don 't have a way to navigate it , you 'd be lost in there for a lifetime . Now , if Wells can figure out a way to make the vest operational , she can move quickly enough to get right through it . So what if we deactivate everything- - Claudia , I can either run or lecture . I cannot do both . This is running ? Wait . Something is off . How can you tell ? Take a whiff . Fudge . Right there . Boom goes the dynamite . Yeah . Chameleon mines . They blend into the landscape so you can 't see them . MacPherson . Yeah , we 're gonna have to find an alternate route . Wait . Again ? I don 't smell Fudge . I have to think like him . He knew I would make it this far . He knew I would test it , and he will expect me to turn around , so ... Wait . Now you 've got me doing it . Look . Dante 's death mask . So ? So I do a lot of inventory . It doesn 't belong there . Nice catch . How come it didn 't go off before ? Because we triggered it on the way through . He wants to box us in , and he 's done that . Okay , well , the flames only go up eight rows . All we have to do is climb 20 , run across the top , and climb down . All we have to do ? On the upside , you 'll be able to work off some of those extra pounds you 've been griping about . Devil child . When do I get one of those ? Two weeks after never . Artie , what 's going on ? Great , you 're back . Now listen to me . Do not deviate one iota from what I 'm about to tell you . Got it , Artie . We 're on our way . Wait , wait . This place is full of booby traps . You 're gonna have to take a long , circuitous route . Aside from that , hurry ! Or ... Ooh . Yeah . Hey , if you 're gonna grab me like that , I need some sweet talk . Just shut up and drive . Watch out ! You are going hit that , okay ? It should be me driving right now . Would you just let me steer ? Or that . That--that works too . Ah . Did you get it ? Mission accomplished . Where 's the vest ? Left it behind . It was spent . All said and done , it wasn 't terribly difficult . Hmm . Before we go , should we celebrate ? What exactly did you have in mind ? Oh . You really are the most unpredictable woman . Took you long enough . I thought I was gonna have to kiss that . Oh . Game over , huh ? So a long way to go for nothing , eh , James ? We still have some bargaining left . Wells is still in the vault , Arthur . I know what the plan is . Let me go . I 'll tell you everything . I 'm disappointed but not surprised . James . James . I knew you 'd use it . Use- - the Phoenix ? You put it in my pocket . I wanted you to see what I saw- - the darkness , the emptiness , that it 's all for nothing . No , James , I saw light ... And peace . I felt nothing but hope . Hope ? Yeah . But all this time , I thought ... I knew the truth . I 'm sorry , Arthur . So she 's gone . There 's absolutely no trace of her . None . I found the vest outside . So is she dangerous ? I mean , do we really need to find her ? Yes , and absolutely . Can 't just have H.G. Wells wandering around the world . No , no , no , no , no . We let her out , got to put her back . That was completely different . That is so disgusting . You 're acting like I did this on purpose . Totally not true . If anybody should be shell-shocked about this , I think it should be me . I don 't see it that way , since I was the victim here . You ? You were the victim ? Yeah . Glad you 're seeing it my way . You wanted to talk to me about something ? Claudia , go easy . We 've all been through a lot . Worst case of identity theft ever . All right . Maybe this will help . No way . Does this mean I 'm an Agent now ? No , it means I can reach you any time of day or night . Okay , not as good . Just be careful . It belonged to philo . " Philo " as in philo Farnsworth ? She gets Farnsworth 's Farnsworth ? Artie . Yeah , I--don 't lose it . Okay . I--thanks . Thank you for coming after me . Yeah . Okay , why is everybody hugging all the time around here ? I still have a bump on my head , you know ? Okay . Jealous ? Not even close . You sure ? Not even . Really ? Let me just see it . No , I don 't think so . I just want to see it . You 're gonna have to Chase me . Come here , you . No . Give Chase , Pete Lattimer . Whoa ! Look out ! Let 's see what H.G. took , shall we ? How do you remember that password ? I do a lot of crossword puzzles . Ah . How do we navigate once we 're in there ? That 's the trick , isn 't it ? They needed to use the Imperceptor Vest . We 've got other options . Put these on . Don 't take them off under any circumstances . Okay , this is amazing . What did I say ? Sorry . Ah , look , there are a few items missing- - her locket , her ring ... And her compact . But why ? Why indeed ? ♪ ♪ hey . What you working on there ? Something I 've been thinking about for a very long time . ♪ ♪

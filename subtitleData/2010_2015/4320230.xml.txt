 Previously on " V " ... I 'm pregnant . Imagine what would happen if Anna ever found out about this . Your family , George ... the V 's were responsible for their deaths . We 've developed a vitamin supplement . Anna 's tagging humans like animals in the wild . We received a message from the warehouse . John May started the Fifth Column ... the first group of Visitors to ever turn against the leadership . We have to crush them . Supply the FBI with a lead . Kyle Hobbes . He can train a resistance . Welcome to the war . - We need more soldiers ... an army . - I 'll make one . No need for regrets for mistakes made yesterday . The past is gone . No looming fate . No uncontrollable destiny . No hunger . No sickness . No fear . No death . Nothing ahead . Nothing behind . Only stillness ... a sanctuary of peace and tranquility . Mia ! My bliss envelops you ... Please wake up . Protects you ... Together we shall experience eternal joy look at me . In a rapture of ecstasy and safety . Look , she 's taking your minds and your lives in return for nothing but lies . No looking back . - No worries of what will come . - Mia . - Just ... safety . - I love you . Knowing that I am here . No worries of what will come . Bask in my light . Anna can steal you no longer . The incident occurred yesterday on the Sydney mother ship . The Fifth Column is becoming more active . Captains in the Tokyo , Paris and Mexico city ships have all reported isolated incidents . The Fifth Column is immune to my bliss . They 've begun to feel human emotion ... Empathy ... Love . If they find a way to unify , they could become a real threat . Get me Joshua . It 's time to eliminate them before they grow any stronger . Chad Decker , WNT , reporting live from the Visitor peace ambassador center as we wait for Marcus , Anna 's second in command , - to address the world ... - Good morning , sweetheart . I should be there . They probably need peace ambassadors to help out . Well , it 's a school day . They probably have plenty of P.As down there . If the Visitors needed you , they 'd call , right ? What am I talking about ? They wouldn 't call . They 're from outer space . They 'd probably just beam you up . Don 't worry , mom . We talked about this . - You have nothing to be afraid of . - Does this look like my scared face ? School comes first . You can go to the ship after , okay ? Okay , mom . Love you . I love you . Ladies and gentlemen , thank you for coming . Later today , Anna will make an announcement from the mother ships that will mark the beginning of our " Live Aboard " program . In return for the gracious hospitality the people of earth have shown by allowing Visitors to live amongst humans , we are proud to announce a new era in V-human relations . People from around the world have applied to this program through our healing centers ... Applied for the program at the healing centers ? - It 's gotta be connected to the R-6 . - ... People who have been randomly chosen to Live Aboard our ships along with us . Randomly selected , my ass . First the R-6 , now this . What the hell are they up to ? - Thank you . - I don 't know . But Decker 's their mouthpiece . Let 's get the guys set up out front . We 're back on live in ten . Maybe we should ask him . I can 't keep Tyler away from that ship . I 'm gonna tell him the truth . - It 's the only way I can protect him . - Tyler 's on Anna 's radar . Any change in his behavior will call attention to him . Now if you tell him the truth , and he doesn 't believe you he 'll believe me . If he believes you , then he 'll sever all ties with the V 's . - He 'll stop going onto that ship . - And Anna will want to know why . He might also want to join the fight against them . You ready to put your son into the war ? How do I keep him away from them ? When I figure that out , I 'll let you know . A priest , a civvy , a lizard and a fed . If this is a joke , I 'm not laughing . - Where 's your army ? - You bark , Hobbes . You bite , too ? - Is that a request ? - We have what we have . Make it work . We have an army . We 're called the Fifth Column . Well , maybe you should ring them , - remind them we 're in a war . - Can 't locate ' em . We 're scattered all around the world in different cities . But I can assure you , Mr. Hobbes , - we 're a sleeping giant . - Then we wake ' em up . Your Fifth Column-they keep their eyes on the ships ? Yeah . Then you use the ships to your advantage . Anna 's making an announcement today . - You make your own . - Okay . How ? You get on her ship , hijack her signal , replace it with your own ... tells your people you 're here , tells her you 're here . It 's a call to arms . But to make it count , you have to bloody her nose while you 're at it . After the warehouse explosion , you 're on the V 's radar . There 's too much heat on you . You 'll never get up there . No , but he can . There 's too much heat on everybody right now . It 's a suicide mission . I 'm all for bloodying Anna 's nose , but we haven 't planned or thought this through yet . Are you paying me to sit on my hands or man up and fight ? I 'm sorry , Hobbes . You 'll have to think of a better plan . Thanks again for seeing us on such short notice . I haven 't been feeling well . I was worried there was something wrong with the baby . Everything looks perfectly normal . So I will let you get cleaned up . Uh , the nurse 'll be in here in a minute . I just want to run a few more tests . Ryan ? Beautiful . You can 't keep canceling her O.B. appointments . You need to tell her the truth before she finds out . I tell her the truth about who I am , I could lose her . I love her , Leah . Everything that I 've ever done , everything that I 've fought for is for her . And besides , I 'm not even sure if we should be going through - with this pregnancy . - Well , you need to decide , and quickly . I don 't like what I 'm seeing in her lab work . The growth is accelerated . The ultrasound that I just showed her in there was not her ultrasound . That was normal human fetus at week six . This is her real ultrasound . This is your child . The accelerated growth is draining Val of phosphorus . That 's what 's making her sick . Visitors like us have high amounts of phosphorus in our bodies ... plenty for a child to live off of if the mother-to-be were a Visitor . Can 't we give her an infusion ? - She needs a denser concentrate . - Okay , so h ... how do I get it ? Humans don 't have the technology to produce it . The only place I know of to get it is on the mother ship . But without it , she won 't survive the pregnancy . Agent Evans , I think I may have a lead on Hobbes . Actually looks real . What are you doing here ? You asked me for a new plan , I 've got one . Sneak into the FBI , get us all thrown in jail ? Going onto that ship without Ryan . The feds ' most wanted man walked right in to this playpen , but they don 't notice him , - because he smells and looks like them . - Get to the point now is the time to get on that ship and embed that message . Why are you in such a hurry to get on the ship ? Those lizards set me up . I want to know why and how and hurt ' em real bad for it . There 's a tactical advantage to embedding that message today , and we need to jump on it . You heard what Ryan said . It 's too risky . - I don 't need Ryan . I 'll do it . - How ? Well , I got in here , didn 't I ? I already told you this is a mistake . - I 'm doing this with or without you . - Really ? Yeah . You know , sneaking into the FBI is one thing . Getting onto a V ship 's a whole another world . Do you know that ? - Is it ? - What are you gonna do when they start speaking in our native tongue ? What happens when you go through security and the core temperature scanner says you 're a human ? Ryan , we don 't know when Anna 's gonna broadcast again . I think we should reconsider going up now . We won 't go up . I will . I thought you said it was a suicide mission ? It is , but it 's the only way I can stop Hobbes from going up . They catch him , we 'll never be able to get onto another ship , and the Fifth Column 's gonna stay scattered . Anna needs to be stopped ... And I 'm the only one that can get onto that ship . Oh , my God ! A typical human would react strongly ... To the devastation that you just witnessed . Based on your neurological readings , your situational empathy is well within the normal range for our species . In short , you do not feel human emotion . Use my results as a baseline . Everyone on the ships will be tested . Find out who 's Fifth Column and who isn 't . All right , so I 'm getting on that ship . It 's gonna be dangerous , so we all need to play our parts perfectly . Here 's how it lays out ... Erica , I need a name from the V diplomatic list . I need a V who 's not in New York ... and won 't be coming back to the ship any time soon . Look for someone the same rank and credentials that I had . My old uniform has to match it . Hobbes , I need your contacts to get me some forged papers . And they gotta look good . The scanner I go through doesn 't just read core temperature . It checks my prints . They 'll need to match the identity of the V Erica finds . Now once I 'm onboard , I look like any other V. And as a v , I can get where I need to go . I hack into the ship 's communication system , embed our call to arms , hightail it home . This shouldn 't take any more than a few hours , so as soon as I 'm down , I 'll call in . You don 't hear from me by 4 : 00 ... you 'll know there 's been a problem . Ryan . Be careful , friend . Thanks . You know , George , if I don 't make it back , I want you to do something for me . Go to Val . Take her to that doctor . Tell her the truth about me . It 's not how I want it to go , but she needs to know . All right ? You just make it home . Ryan knows what he 's doing going up in the ship . He 'll be okay . He 's not the only one I 'm worried about . Your son . The Visitors are going to announce their " Live Aboard " program tonight . And you think Tyler 's going to want to live with them up there ? He loves the Visitors . The Visitors took everything I had . I don 't want that to happen to you . How are you gonna stop Tyler from living with the V 's ? By taking him to someone he loves more . So ... What 's up with the fab four , Hobbes ? You tell me . First one 's a case ... George Sutton . Worked as a chemical engineer . Went crazy after his family were murdered . Claimed aliens did it . Maybe not so crazy , right ? The priest did two tours as an army chaplain . Testified against two staff sergeants in baghdad - who broke the rules of engagement . - Boy scout . - Mm-hmm . - And the fed ? Clean jacket , but her ex-partner 's M.I.A. Supposedly working with terrorists . Whole lot of personal baggage on her , too . It 's all there . Last one ... Ryan Nichols . He 's a stockbroker . Outside of a knocked-up girlfriend , he 's the cleanest of the bunch . Maybe too clean . If he 's got dirt on him , you have to find it yourself . They 've got something over you , don 't they ? Not for long . Ty ! What ... Dad . I know . We made great time . Got here earlier than we expected . - How you doing , bud ? - Good . I put a new show stopper exhaust on my bike . - Really ? - Yeah . I just got a new bike . T-750 . You want to go check it out ? - It 's in the shop . - Hell , yeah . And be careful . That 's a lot of jam . What are you doing here , Erica ? We should talk . Welcome to the mother ship . Please line up for security check ... Visitors to the left and human tourists to the right . Thank you . Enjoy your stay . Right hand , please . Right hand , please . Right hand , please . Welcome back to the ship . Next in line , please . - Is there a problem ? - This visa 's not working . It didn 't clear . Run it again . It cleared . Right hand , please . Welcome back to the ship , Jeff . Next in line , please . He failed . His response measured 1118 on the biometric level ... just slightly above Anna 's baseline reading , but above . There must be a mistake . Phillip is one of my most trusted advisors . I 'll test him again . Why ? I 've discovered the test has a margin of error . How big ? Based on the number of false positives I 've extrapolated , roughly 2 % . If the results could be wrong , his and others ... shouldn 't we discontinue testing ? No . Keep testing . Hold all those who fail . I 'll deal with them personally . V 's , huh ? Yeah . I 'm a peace ambassador . Peace ambassador ? Yeah . I pass out information and , uh , help out at the P.A.C. , that kind of stuff . I mean , it 's pretty cool . Wow . Visitors , alien ships ... it 's just so amazing , huh ? Yeah , you think a twin 750 's tough , dad ? You should see their engine room . - It is something else . - Yeah ? I 'm glad you wanted to see me . I kind of miss having you around . Yeah , me , too . I 'm sorry about everything , dad . Sorry about what ? Splitting you and mom up . - What ? - Look , I know it was my fault . - No , it wasn 't . - Yes , it was . If I didn 't have my motorcycle accident ... No . No , no , no . No , that 's ... that 's not what happened . - It 's not that simple . - Then what did happen , dad ? Why don 't ... why don 't you just tell me ? All you need to know ... Is it 's not your fault . Okay ? You 're a good kid . Thanks , dad . What are you doing with phosphorus ? My supervisor sent me for it . Jeff Singer . Ninth deck . Come with me . Members of our race are falling prey to human emotion , becoming immune to Anna 's bliss . This test measures your susceptibility to this phenomenon . Failure means death . Anna 's announcement about the " Live Aboard " program is scheduled to begin in less than an hour . Chad Decker for WNT from the Visitor peace ambassador center . Back soon . Hey , thank you . Here you go . Hi . Thanks . You 're a popular man . The V 's are a hell of a story . Father ... Jack Landry . Yes , they are . What can I do for you ? I 've been watching your pieces on the healing centers . And when you spoke about your aneurysm on tv , you gave a lot of people hope . Many of them who were afraid of the V 's aren 't anymore , thanks to you . Oh , what 's there to be afraid of ... miracles ? No . Speaking of miracles , you were diagnosed , - what was it , a week ago ? - Yeah . Why have you waited so long to be healed ? Well , I 'm beginning my treatments now . We 're telling the story in five parts for sweeps . How can I help you , Father ? Some of my parishioners are concerned the V 's are doing something in their centers that ... That we 're not being told about . I 'm just asking for you to make sure that they are safe , Mr. Decker , before you endorse those healing centers . That 's all I 'm asking . Good luck with sweeps . Ryan , it 's Erica . I haven 't heard from you . I 'm getting worried . Please call me . Do you want to tell me what 's really going on ? Where 's Tyler ? He 's on the phone with his girlfriend . We both know that you didn 't bring Tyler here for him . And you wouldn 't be here if you didn 't need something from me . I need you to keep him . Things are crazy in the city with work , and I 'm barely home . Well , work has always been busy . That 's never been a problem before . Why now ? You might have noticed that the world has turned a little bit upside down since the Visitors arrived . I 'm working triple time . Please , Joe . He needs you . I need you to do this . What are you not telling me ? Nothing . I 'll take him . Of course , I 'll take him . But you need to know that he thinks that ... That he 's the reason why we split up . And we can 't let him carry that weight . It 's time that we told him the truth about who he really is . It 's nice to meet you , Georgie . Ryan 's an old friend . - Here you go . - Thank you . Come on in . You know , I haven 't been able to reach him all day . You haven 't talked to him recently ? Uh , no , I 've been trying as well , but he hasn 't been answering . You know , he said he was gonna be working late , - so I 'm sure he 's just busy . - Yeah . I 'm sure he 'll call soon . - Oh , sorry . It is such a mess . - Oh , that 's okay . That 's okay . You 're , um ... - Pregnant . - Yeah . We 're not really telling people yet . - Congratulations . - Thanks . Do you have kids ? - Two . - Oh . Wow . You know , just , uh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry to have bothered you . - No . - No , no , no . No . You just , uh , - just tell Ryan I stopped by . - Okay . Sure . Father . I 've been thinking about what you said ... About your parishioners . I 've got questions . I may not have the answers you need . Then who does ? You . Me ? You have access to the ships , to Anna . You want the truth ? That 's the place to look ... not here . You want me to go behind Anna 's back and do what ? Make sure the V 's aren 't doing anything that will harm us . You gotta give me something here , Father ... - a place to start . - I already gave you a place to start . I 've got nothing else to give you except some frightened parishioners in a confessional with a hunch . And you expect me to risk my entire career ... On a hunch ? You already have a hunch something 's wrong , Chad . You wouldn 't be here if you didn 't . - You won that race . - No , dad , Brandon won that race . He did not win that race . It was you . I didn 't ... but that was another time . Y ... you took ... you went past him , like , 50 feet before the end . - You don 't remember that ? - Evans . Work . Ryan 's not back yet . Have you heard from him ? - No , I haven 't heard from anybody . - I 'm worried . What if he 's hurt ... Or worse ? I was thinking of going up there . Georgie , going up there now could make it worse . Stay put . I 'm headed back right now . I 'll meet you at the church . Yeah , yeah , right . You okay ? Let me guess ... you gotta go back for work ? Good guess . That okay ? Yeah . Dad asked if , uh , I could stay with him . I know you weren 't thinking that , but , uh ... Tyler , you want to stay ? Yeah . Is that okay ? Yeah . Just promise me one thing ... - don 't do anything I wouldn 't do , okay ? - Which leaves what ? Nothin ' . Fine . - I love you . - I love you , too , mom . He failed . You 're not from the ship . - You 're Fifth Column , aren 't you ? - No , I 'm not . Samuel followed you from the atrium after you boarded the ship . He saw you react to the baby . He saw you take the phosphorous , and I saw you fail the test . Joshua . It 's good to meet you . This is Samuel . He 's with us , too . Ryan . How many of us on these ships ? Not many , and there 'll be less soon , now that Anna 's started testing . How many on the ground ? - We 're strong in numbers , but we 're not organized . - What are you doing up here ? I 'm here to embed a message in Anna 's announcement , a call to arms . Good . We 're gonna need an army . Anna 's birthing soldiers . How much time do we have ? Not very much unless we can stop it . You have to get off this ship . You have to warn the other Fifth Column on the ground . I 've gotta embed that message . I 'll do it . You go . If they catch you here , there 'll be nothing I can do . Those soldiers ... you need to stop ' em . How will I contact you ? John May had a comms device ... untraceable , outdated tech . It was in Reedsville last time he used it . - Find it . - I will . The phosphorous ... It 's for a human woman ? - Yes . - You have any idea what that means ? I do . But I 've got no choice . She 'll die without it . Once you give it to her , Ryan , there 's no going back ... Ever . - Good morning , sweetheart . - I should be there . They probably need peace ambassadors to help out . Well , Ty , it 's a school day . Where are we with Tyler ? He seems to have calmed his mother 's fears . Yes , he has . But he 's still not here on the ship with you . There will always be obstacles in your way . It 's not if you remove them , but how . Get him . You haven 't heard from Georgie at all ? - No , not since this morning . - Damn it . I told him to meet me here . Have you seen or talked to Georgie ? Yeah , he went up there , to the U.F.O. What ? When ? A couple hours ago . He asked me to give him a weapon he could go through security with . You knew ? You let him go up there alone ? - What kind of person are you ? - A realist . No , Erica . A realist would know that the only damn thing Georgie can do is die up there ! Why in God 's name did you send him up there ? A realist knows that Ryan is more important to the cause than Georgie . If Ryan was in trouble , it was an acceptable risk - to send Georgie up ... - That was not your call to make ! You need Ryan . He 's a V. He 's got access and knowledge Georgie doesn 't . Now Georgie , like it or not , is acceptable collateral . Now you can 't get used to that , you 've already lost . Welcome to the mother ship . - Visitors to the left and human tourists to the right . - Thank you . Good evening . It is with great pleasure at I announce you the official commencement of our " Live Aboard " program . Our guests will observe the Visitor way of life , have full access to the best of our technology , recreational activities and healing care . Each of our 29 ships have selected participants from every city in the world . Gente de la Gran Ciudad de Madrid ... People from all over this great planet will soon receive official invitations . The candidates will come from all walks of life ... housewives , plumbers , scientists , business people . I hope those of you who have been chosen will consider living amongst ... Peace always . Welcome to the New York mother ship . There are guided tours departing from the welcome platform every 15 minutes . Jeff Singer . Jeff Singer ! Georgie . Go be with your wife , Ryan . She and your child need you . Long live the Fifth Column ! The Fifth Column embedded a message - in your " Live Aboard " announcement this evening . - How ? - How ? - A human snuck away from a tour group , killed one of our guards . He 's in our custody . We believe he had help . We 'll find out who he was working with soon enough . What did the message say ? " John May lives . " Everything 's falling into place . The Fifth Column on the ground has been in hiding for too long . This message will give them the confidence to come out , and when they do , we 'll be waiting for them . With the launch of the " Live Aboard " program , we 'll win the hearts and minds of the humans up here while we crush the Fifth Column down there . Hey . Hey . How are you feeling ? Oh , I 'm tired . I 'm glad you 're home , though . I really missed you . Mm , I missed you , too . Oh , uh , a friend of yours stopped by today ... Georgie Sutton . - Georgie ? - Yeah . What 'd he say ? He said he stopped by to say hi , said we made a nice family . He was happy for us . He said you 'd have his number if you wanted to call him . Listen . I gotta go back to work . How about I make you a nice cup of tea , - then I 'll tuck you in ? - Mm , that sounds really nice . Each of you has failed my test . Your allegiance to me has fallen under question . This is your opportunity to redeem yourselves . There 's your margin of error . Those who just took their lives have proven their devotion to me . This test will cost countless others their lives before we 're done . Skin them . You should have never let him - get on that ship ! - I made a judgment call . You 're more valuable to the team than he is , and you know that . - He was my friend . - Hurting him won 't change anything . Georgie 's stuck up there . Ryan , we 're gonna need to put our heads together and figure out how to get him back , - and we 're gonna need him to do it . - We 'll get Georgie back , Ryan . - Yeah , then I deal with you . - Yeah . What are they gonna do to him ? They won 't kill him , not right away . - So we have a window ? - Yeah , a short one . Well , getting back up on that ship ... it ... it won 't be easy , not now . You put my friend on that ship . You better make damn sure we get him back . There 's no more shuttles tonight . We 're going to have to wait until morning . We can pray , that Georgie 's sacrifice was not for nothing . If I had been here , maybe Georgie wouldn 't have gone up in that ship . No . You were where you were supposed to be . Driving away from that house tonight without Tyler , without my son ... What kind of mother just leaves her child ? Tyler 's on the V 's radar . You did what you had to do to protect your son . That 's what you did by leaving him . At least he 's safe , right ? He 's safe . Lisa . What are you doing here ? I missed you . Come on in .

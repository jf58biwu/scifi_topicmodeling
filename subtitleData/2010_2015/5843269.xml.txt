 United Pictures presents an Opus Pictures production LEE MIN-KI PARK SUNG-WOONG LEE TAE-IM Who the fuck ? ! Son of a bitch ! FOR THE EMPEROR I really don 't get it . I don 't know if that was a miscalculation on his part , or limitation of his control , but he couldn 't fulfill his duties as a relief pitcher , and completely blew the lead ... Where did it all begin ? Busan High Pitcher Lee Hwan leads team to series win MVP Pitcher Lee Hwan Scouted to Red Whales Most Anticipated Debut Sudden Shoulder Injury Dropped to 2nd String A walk , then a triple in the 9th , and a loss by 2 equals 50x payout . Is he really a rookie ? His accuracy is one of a kind . Let 's finish the deal . Fine ! Hey ! Everything 's here ? It was a few hundred short last time . Don 't be a cheapskate over pocket change . We got heavy unloaders today , play a few hands . It 's littered with rich fucking posers . See you . Let 's go . Hwan , let 's do this again soon . You 're short a bundle . Did I bring you to the 1st string for sucking me off ? Commission , asshole . Motherfucker ... Incoming raid ! Get out ! Catch-and-release is my job as a prosecutor . Treat me to fancy sushi soon . Take care , Sang-ha . Even penny slot players are gamblers . You 're lucky , Hwan . Bud ! Isn 't this yours ? Look at them bruises , are you alright ? It looks pretty bad . My heart fucking aches ... Listen here . Loans are supposed to be paid back , not to be forgotten . If you paid in time , you coulda saved them bruises , and have a good laugh . Who the fuck ? I want my money . Is that fucking mutt lost ? - Here . - Yes , sir . Listen here , you shit , you 're so out of your ... Wait ! It 's the king of game fixer , Lee ... Look , look . Stop right there . You really surprised me . A tough guy , eh ? I don 't know what your deal is , but being an athlete means shit in this part of town . Tossing balls now and then , and street fights are ... I said I 'm sorry . Fuck your fucking sorry , fucker . I need to be compensated , $ 10,000 . Give me a card . Hwangje Capital - It 's him ? - Yes , boss . He was kicked out for game-rigging . He 's the one . Cute . You outnumbered him , yet , he still bested you ? If I wanted to , I could have smashed his spine and every bone in his body . But we outnumbered him , so we went gentle . Hey , you 'll freeze to death . Get up , mister ! Out of my way ! Look at this prick . It 's unacceptable to come back empty from a collection . Jong-ho , weren 't you on top of this ? Rockfish still has some clout on the streets . Shit could hit the fan if we don 't tread carefully . Don 't make excuses like a bitch . You 're the fuck who called ? This guy 's a piece of work . You want a loan for the compensation ? Isn 't that why you wanted to see me ? I don 't got shit . So why shouldn 't I ask a shady loan shark ? Brave motherfucker , this one . Get the fuck up , if you wanna keep breathing ! Enough . I did ask for you . What 'll you do for the money ? Shouldn 't you at least have some credibility ? He 's called Rockfish a retired gangster . This fat fuck took off with our money . Young man , isn 't life more important than money ? Don 't get worked up and get killed , sit this one out and observe . See how pros do it . - Let 's go ! - Yes , boss . Bring Sang-ha , you hear me ? ! Stay out of this , I got this ! Son of a whore ! Come at me ! Who the fuck are you ? Do you know who I am ? So , you 're goldfish ? Goldfish ? Time to pay up if you had enough fun . Motherfucker ! What the fuck ... Rockfish 's all but finished in Busan . Done deal ? Everyone knows you now , what will you do ? - Why do you care ? - Why shouldn 't I ? Continue working for us . You got the chops . Overconfidence alone won 't put food on the table . Either cook , or line up at a soup kitchen . If not ... starve to death . When does he start ? He 'll report tomorrow , sir . Life 's full of ironies . How 's Madame Cha ? She 's doing well . The old man likes her too . Tell her to keep a good watch . Put him in good mood . Yes , sir . Hi ! Got a boner ? Let 's go . Boss , he 's in great shape . I picked out his clothes . He 's got a good build , so everything fits . Even rags look good on him . Fuck that shit , look how skinny he is . Leave the past behind , and have a fresh start . Yes , sir . Come on , boss ! He took care of a weak ass bitch , there 's no need to put him on a high horse . Fucking gambler . What the fuck are you staring at ? I 'll fucking rip your eyes out ! Boy , get up Get the fuck up ! Calm down . Hwan is now part of the family . Raise your glasses . Didn 't make you for a cheap drunk . Stay with Kyung-su and learn the ropes . Yes , sir . Wait , come here . Fucking smooth . Stick it at the right height . When you 're on the toilet , squeezing shit out , your soul is also released ... And at that moment , they have to see the sticker . Don 't you see this ? I know it 's an Au-fucking-di . - It 's worth more than ... - Fine , deal 's over . Wait , please ! Let 's go . No , I 'm not done here . Hold on a minute . 1-click Bets - League Schedule Let 's go . Did you turn it off ? I picked a few teams . You fucking nuts ? ! Fuck off ! Hands off ! HVe-jllng , you 're up . 100 grand ! 200 ! Jackpot ! Holy fucking shit ! Going home ? What 's the most useless thing in our business ? Sir ? Sympathy . Sympathy won 't make you rich . If you sympathize with a pig , how 'd you eat pork ? So cool ... You see ? Once you let go of sympathy , you gain respect . Luck or skill ? The betting , I mean . You play a lot ? Ball players can 't make bets . Baseball is all I know , so I see the big picture quickly . Why don 't you manage our sports betting website ? If you 're so versed in betting , you can manipulate the odds and game selection to our favor . Think it over and open the glove compartment . Take it . It 's an older model , but Benz is still a status symbol . I 'm alright . You can 't park here . I was about to leave . Got plans tomorrow ? Who is he ? Your pimp ? Just a friend . Missy . You two rubbed uglies , haven 't you ? He wouldn 't look at me so menacingly othewvise . Was she tasty ? Her pussy still firm and tight ? Who the fuck are you ? ! Stop it . Stop it ! I thought he 'd get 5 years , but he only served 3 . Cutter 's not someone who 'll let bygones be bygones . Stay on full alert . Hwan , pay your respect . This is Hwangje 's chairman . He takes care of our betting website . He 's got the wits and punches to boot . Probably good at choking old men too . So the congressman 's lobby didn 't work ? Buhyun Bank is tight with the ruling party . An idiot can only do so much . At least you got the casino and hotel stakes out of this . Please ease your mind . Imagine doing it on my land , know how much that 'd be ? We 're not talking about a few million . Take good care of the men noted there . How did this break ... I 'm sorry , chairman , I 'll replace it , sir . Got $ 500,000 on you ? Bury him when you break hotel ground . Please spare me , I will ... replace it with something similar within my power . I 'm sorry sir , please . Due to newly excavated relic at Blue City construction site , development will be postponed . Checkmate . Do you see those lights ? Aren 't those squid boats ? Right . Squid come swimming toward those lights . I guess all living things are attracted to shiny things . - Agree ? - Yes . Funny thing is , people call those 'Lights of Night Sea ' . But up close , it 's a chaotic slaughterhouse . Our business is the same . If you want to succeed , your eyes have to lit up like that . Boss ... could I ask you something ? Why did you take me in ? I was at a point of no return . Lee Hwan . It 's a great name . A name that reeks of money . 3 years later Hwangje Finance - Good morning , sir . - Good morning . Boss , how do you expect me to walk away now ? Your match rigging article will be released . We finally got it legalized , so imagine the backlash . It won 't be pretty . You know full well how hard I worked on it . By yourself ? Anyway , bring me the complete list of games you fixed . Do you still go to Temptation ? A dirty mop is for cleaning , not to be used as a blanket . Remember that . Shouldn 't you be on a debt collection run somewhere ? Here to boost my business ? What a fucking day ... Look at this bitch ! Your promotion isn 't your fucking high horse . Did I beg for it ? He went too far this time . Isn 't it time to cut him loose ? Tae-m u . We 're going on 15 years , right ? Why do you think I 've kept you ? Sir ? I don 't know ... Some unique qualities ? You were always by my side . I won 't turn my back on members of my family first . I 'll give Hwan a warning , take care of your own boys . There 's another pressing matter . Cutter will be out soon . Busan Penitentiary Only the hungry grabs the fishing pole . Are you using Hwan as your bait ? Speak of the devil . I don 't own anything . Money has no master . Money only lets out a scent . That scent is the sweetest in the world . But once you taste it , it turns into poison , and rot you from inside . I know you desire to be rich . Then only chase the scent . Are you sure ? Boss , Hwan is with the old man . Could he be dipping into a different pocket , because you pulled him out ? He may feel cornered , there 's nothing he won 't do . Welcome . The news of Marina sector seeking private capital will be out soon . Won 't it look great with a few yachts , and a resort over there ? Sounds very expensive . Business is done not with money , but with people . Indeed , the chairman 's influence casts a wide net . Congratulations , sir . No need for that . I 'm still just a front . We must free ourselves from our sponsors and stand tall . A9 Feed ? Don 't lose sleep over the website . Can 't live forever on fringes of the law . I know you worked so hard to relocate the servers . It 's fine , don 't fret it sir . If this takes off , I 'm leaving the loan business behind . From here on , these are our future . Very nice . I need a good sponsor and stand tall too . Where were you in the afternoon ? Kyung-su was looking for you . I had things to take care of . Yeah ? You can 't do everything you desire to do , and become someone you desire . We all have pre-destined paths . If you know your place in life , everything 'd be easy . I guess it 's not always so obvious . I hope you still prefer old man 's cock . Why are you so late ? Did you have a VIP or something ? Did Sang-ha tell you ? All I got is this body ... If they 're paying , what can I not do ? Loan without any interest ... Nothing I can 't do . Madame Cha 's debt ... is significant . I 'll take care of it . So you 'll blanket the mop ? Transfer Cha 's debt to Hwan . Also , spread his responsibilities to others . Dipshit , if you took out a loan , have the decency to pay back ! I 'll pay back ! Look at this punk ass , think you 're all that ? Afternoon . Don 't you know this is my turn ? Jong-ho sent us ... Get the fuck out of my face . Do you really want me dead ? Your interest won 't die with you . Hwan ! I really hope that I won 't see your blood on my hands . This 250,000 ha sector includes ... So how much ? Of the $ 201.5 million , $ 150 million will be privatized . Who are they negotiating with ? HY and Jeil , but HY 's the front runner . Isn 't chairman Kang in charge of Jeil Marina ? That 's correct , sir . Give him a call . Right away . Chairman Kang , yeah , it 's me . I hear you 're working on something fun . What ? It 's no fun ? Should I spice things up ? Is it okay to be here during the day ? Who cares . I polished a piece of shit into gold , but someone else 'll reap the benefits , and I 'm reduced to collecting debts from the feeble . But that 's how you got to where you are now . This 'll make you feel better . There was only sky and sea here . Why 's it so messy now ? Even a mountain changes in a decade . Ocean will surely too . This is rather awkward . You have to leave , sir . Prepare two matching coffins . Lead him out of here ! What 's an abandoned rook doing on the chessboard ? ! Take care of it ! Let go ! Perhaps you took your job too personally . - What are you talking about ? - Don 't play dumb . I was grooming Hwan just fine . I will not allow him to falter because of you . He 's not your fucking mutt ! Cha Yun-su ... Madame Cha , I mean . Can you handle it ? Take the fucking knife ! Did that whore take your fucking balls ? Stand down , boy . You up for this ? Motherfucker ! It 's all your own undoing . Don 't you know what we 're here to do ? How could I not ? Kill ' em all ! You fucker ... You fucker ... Try to stay awake . Boss , the cleaning is done . But Cutter isn 't out of the picture . Yes , sir . You Okay ? The call cannot be connected ... Next up , Han Young-su , a former Red Whales , has committed suicide . His bereaved family stated that he took his own life , when he was unable to control his mounting debt . CEO Jung Sang-ha Where is the end of this road ? How will I look when I finally reach it ? Here for Madame Cha ? Do you know where she is ? She 's famous for ripping men off . She probably got to several others too . Tonight ... could be the end for Jong-ho . Did you ... Plan it ? Is that what you think too ? Don 't fuck around , say it straight ! I saw you ... stab him . Is that what you want to believe ? Say it again . Go on , slice me . Slice me open . Goddamn fuck ! Getting stabbed is on par for our line of work . But I won 't tolerate my own turning his back on me . Stop yapping and go home . We got work cut out for us . Off you go . Sang-ha , my boy - Hwan ! Boss is in trouble ! I can 't reach Tee-mu . Remember where we first met ? Looks like Sang-ha raised a fine minion . You 're Cutter ? So disrespectful ... Son , kids who don 't respect elders don 't live long . Then come earn my respect . You should 've stayed down . What will you do ? If I go to hell , I 'll bribe Lucifer and go to heaven . Life 's full of ironies . Isn 't it funny ? Sang-ha burned you , but you unknowingly worship him . He 's the one who fucked your life . You were caught in the trap he laid out for me . You pitiful bastard ... Continue working for us . But up close , it 's a chaotic slaughterhouse . But I won 't tolerate my own turning his back on me . Please join me in welcoming the new CEO of Jeil Marina , who 'll lead our ocean industry to the international stage . I sincerely thank you all for attending this grand occasion . No calling , no moving , no talking ! " If you desire money , chase the scent . " That 's what you said to me . You can 't even differentiate money from blood now ? I 'm up for it , sir . Go on now . There 're already cruise boats on Han River , a few more yachts isn 't a big fuss . I 'm dreaming even bigger things . Looks like ... you don 't dream very big . It must look petty to politicians . What do money and power have in common ? The one who 's holding it is the master . You should become the master of your own domain . You said so yourself . " Once you let go of sympathy , you gain respect . " So why did you pity me ? You must be gravely mistaken . I ... never pitied you . I don 't ... even know what sympathy is . From here on , I 'll only feed on respect . Hwan . Should you be like this ? - Be well . - They 're not ... people we can handle . A rook ... leapt out of the chessboard . Come , sit down . We got an extraordinary relationship . Endless greed ... You tasted money too well . Your head must be rotten to hell . Cut him slowly , let him feel it . I need some popcorn . So many plot twists . Look over here please ! Did you contribute to the ruling party 's campaign ? I had the ledger in front of me . Where is it ? I 'm dying to know that myself too . Where could it be ? In any case , that 's the situation we 're in . Take a good rest while at it . Make sure to find out what happened . Also , release Sang-ha back out . This isn 't a soccer game , you don 't sub one for another . I 'll setup another game . You just reset the board . You 're the only king I recognize on the chessboard . But I 'm the one who controls the board , even rook . Don 't forget it . Boss , did you see the old man on TV yesterday ? He looked so frail and pathetic ! How did you work your magic ? Boss , everything 's calm now , why don 't you bring her back ? Kyung-SU . I realized that she never once came to me first . I finally understand why . Let 's hear the weather forecast . Yes , boss . CEO Lee Hwan Why go to such lengths for him ? Watching him eat with his bare hands ... was like ... seeing myself . Cutter and I followed the old man blindly . But Hwan is sitting at his dinner table . So as a parting gift , I 'll give him a spoon . Take everyone out . These are the statement and contract , everything 's here . Shall we ? Could I get a smoke ? I said a goddamn smoke ! This is all you got ? Get ready . Hwan , you got a smoke ? You didn 't have to do this . Let go ! Rat fucker ... Send him to his mom . BOY Motherfucker ! Come here , you little shit ! Lee Hwan How did we end up like this ? There 's a storm brewing . Let 's go inside ... Could I have stopped it ? When should I have stopped ? The clouds in the sky ... feel too close ... directed by PARK SANG-JUN

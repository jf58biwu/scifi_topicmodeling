 D-Don 't look at that ! This is for an ongoing investigation ! Oh , so that 's your suspect ? O-Of course not ! This is a monster ! Anyway , did you need something ? Yeah ... I wanted you to take a look at this . Is he a friend of yours ? It 's good work . You have talent . So , does anything about him strike you as odd ? Like , maybe his personality or his way of thinking ... You draw faces for a living , so you can tell , right ? You 've got to be kidding . Not when this is all I 've got to go on . I see . He 's alone again today . Is he waiting for someone ? Or is he watching someone ? Hey ! Heads up ! Uh ... Are you okay ? Yeah . A ... A fake face ... I really have to patch things up with Murano today . Murano ! About the other day , that was ... Well , it wasn 't anything serious . She was just messing with me . So ... Shinichi . What , Migi ? Now 's not a good time . I 'm sensing hostility in Shimada . I believe I said I 'd end you , but if you insist . Let 's go somewhere ... away from prying eyes . He has four to six targets , most likely all human . It will be a massacre . Izumi-kun ? If you want to intervene , I can give you their location . What do you want to do ? What choice do I have ? !

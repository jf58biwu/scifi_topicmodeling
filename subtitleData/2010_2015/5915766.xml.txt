Sebba Your uncle is here . You owe me a favor , girl . Without me you were still in that fucking town instead of this fucking town . I want my money , girl . Those stupid Americans can keep . But you took something that belongs to me . Not the smartest thing you 've ever done . But no one ever said that you 're smart , do you ? Invisible bitch . Wake up . Where is the whore with pink hair ? What are you looking at ? Where do you think you 're going ? And who might you be ? - I 'm her uncle . Is that so ? Then you and I are practically family . Where is the little bitch ? She 's gone , but I know where the money is . Really ? What are you waiting for ? Go get it . Get out . And if you 're not back soon , fall further deaths . Is this a dream ? - Life is a dream . But I can die in your place . - Why would you do that ? Who are you ? - I 've had many names . King Jayavarman , one to seven . But it 's time for me to leave . Let me die in your place . But my time has come . - Uncle . Why are you still on the beach ? - Look at him , Aroon . He is in love . I can not allow you that Sebba . She 's in trouble . You can save her . Wait a minute . What are you talking about ? Lonny 's dead ... I 'm dying . This is something I must do . What should I do ? So let me put an end to this mess . These nails are old . Nobody said anything about a bridge of reeds and wood . Indiana Jones . This bridge is rickety . Great that . Hello , sweetheart . Where 's your boyfriend ? - He 's dead . Riddance . He is the only reason why you 're still alive . Leave these people alone , Sebba and you can have it . - You can not order me , whore . Throw that case to me . Quiet . Beautiful , is not it . This is for my mother . Give you never , girl ? No . Bitch . - No . Is that all you got , pussy ? You can not run anymore . You must go back . Not without you . I can not ... - My time has come . I was wrong about something . Life after death is beautiful . - But I love you . I can not lose you . Not again . I love you too . Now . You 're going to get a brand new life . Do not worry . I will wait for you . Lonny showed me the true meaning of love in the last moments of his life . He chose to give and find love . How short it would be in this world . It was my choice to return ... for him to move on with life . To cure . End , the chosen one must choose life . I do not know what happens tomorrow or what changes I will see ... I 'm alive . And who says that I can go there from time to time not visit him ? I can not die .

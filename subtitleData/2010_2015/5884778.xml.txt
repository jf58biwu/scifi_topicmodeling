 [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ CROWD CHEERING ] [ MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING AND CROWD CHEERING ] [ ¶ ] BIX : Ever since I was a kid , I felt like I was being watched . Hidden cameras recording my life . And I 'd lie awake at night and think , " Who 's watching me ? What makes me so special ? " Now it 's a transparent society . We 're all bugged 24 / 7 in everything we do , watched and measured , counted and stored . Data becomes metadata , and all our lives are digitized . So I embrace it . I am The Bug . I 'm always listening , recording , mixing , remixing . I 'm a sound collector , sonic manipulator . My music comes from the world around me . Noises are my instruments . The Bug is bugged . My cameras are always on , antennas up , ready to receive . And still I wonder , who 's watching me ? And why ? [ ¶ ] Are you ready for this ? EMCEE : It 's Bix the Bug ! [ CROWD CHEERING ] [ AUDIENCE CHEERING ] [ ¶ ] MAN : Go ! Go ! BIX [ VOICE DISTORTED ] : I am The Bug . [ AUDIENCE CHEERING ] [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ WHIRRING ] [ BUZZING ] BIX [ VOICE DISTORTED ] : Transmission in 10 ... BIX AND AUDIENCE [ IN UNISON ] : Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . [ BUZZING AND WHIRRING ] [ AUDIENCE CHEERING ] [ ¶ ] DANNY : Hey , hey . Great show tonight , B. Bet we had over a hundred people out there . Yeah , at the most . Oh , come on , man . I mean , it 's growing . We got the helmet , website , spy cams . Something 's missing , Danny . The Bug is bugged , but nobody cares . Maybe you need a new sound . What 's that supposed to mean ? I don 't know , man . Mix it up a little bit , try to go mainstream . No compromising the music . Look , I 'm trying to do something different . Well , here 's something different , okay ? We 're broke . We got a stack of bills like the Leaning Tower of Pisa over our heads . I don 't wanna leave living in the RV . Fuck it , man , at least we got tonight , right ? We might as well party while we can . By the way , that dude came by again . What ? Yeah , that guy who 's , like , stalking you . Curtis Garret . Garret ? I thought you got rid of that guy . I did , but he came back . He said he needs to talk to you . It 's very important . Just hear him out . He 's harmless . Sure . I mean , invite him to the party . I don 't care . [ ¶ ] DANNY : Here 's the guy , Bix . Say hello . Hey . Matthew Laughlin . Long time . Do you remember me ? Curtis Garret . Um ... I was in your class at MIT a few years back . Professor Hanson 's Robotics Computing . I dropped that a long time ago , though . And the name is Bix now . Yeah . No , I know . I mean , I know that you dropped out . It doesn 't matter . Um ... Actually , is there someplace that we could talk in private ? Yeah , dude , you 're looking at it . [ CHUCKLES ] Do you remember Hanson 's research involving the Teslascope ? Um ... Sure . Maybe . The Hyperdimensional Oscillator . It 's real , Matthew . I--I have a prototype that I built . It works . [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] DANNY : Yo . You 're still here ? MATTHEW : Um ... I have the scope all set up . It 's outside in my truck . Will you listen ? You are a persistent little fucker , aren 't you ? Come on , it 's time to go , bro . Party 's over . Look , Matthew . I promise you , I 'm not crazy , okay ? I 'm not delusional . You might understand these signals I 'm receiving . They 're just radio intercepts , man . You 're hearing voices , my friend . No , not voices . No language , sounds . Noises . Very unique harmonic electronic noises . What , you mean like music ? Yeah , musical in tone , definitely . Possibly a code . I don 't know . See , I 'm not ... I 'm not a musician . I 'm not an artist . That 's why I came to you . Look , will you just listen ? [ ¶ ] So you built this yourself ? Well , using Tesla 's original schematics , yes . Wait , so let me get this straight . This thing talks to outer space , huh , buddy ? Nikola Tesla claimed that it could make contact with extraterrestrial worlds . Right . You do remember . Extraterrestrials , like aliens ? Ha , ha . " E.T. phone home . " Extraterrestrial means not of this Earth . We 're not talking about flying saucers or green men . We 're talking about unprecedented contact with non-human intelligence from beyond our concept of space and time . That 's really cool . Which end do I stick my dick in ? Does he need to be here ? He 's just fucking with you . Go on . Okay . Well , the device , it functions on a quantum level . I mean , the smallest scale imaginable , but it still needs a high-energy power source . [ BUZZING ] Look , don 't get too close , because when the transmission comes through , the energy exchange is quite intense and things do get kind of hot . [ WHIRRING AND BUZZING ] [ ¶ ] How can I help ? Well , I need you to listen to all the transmissions I 've received , help me put the pieces together , you know , crack the code . Code ? Yeah , I think that it 's a message . Whatever 's on the other end , it 's something or someone that we 've never heard from before . " It 's like radio for speaking to God . " I don 't like you . Would you come talk ? Would you play along , you douche ? DANNY : This guy is clearly cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs . I don 't wanna get ball cancer from this thing , whatever the fuck it is . You obviously did not hear what I just heard . I heard something raw , okay ? It sounds like fucking noise . It is noise . But guess what ? That 's the business we 're in . [ SCOPE BUZZES ] Just follow my lead . This has structure . Exactly . Exactly . There 's clearly some form of communication going on . It 's almost- - It 's hypnotic , yes ? You know , some sort of , like , resonant telepathy . I mean , the spoken word is limited , but vibrations , harmonics , I mean , that is communication , like , on a primal level . You came to the right MIT dropout , because this is what Bix the Bug does . Check this out . [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] MATTHEW : Yeah , um , but why are you- - ? Why are you adding a drum beat and all those extra effects ? I didn 't come here to make techno music . I came here- - Hey , hey , pal . That 's what my boy does . He makes music . That was fucking killer , bro . Okay , yeah , it was killer , but I don 't need a DJ . Hey , excuse me , you gotta- - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Ryan Seacrest is a fucking DJ . Bix the Bug is an artist . I don 't need to dance to this . I need to crack it . Look , you came to me , and I can help you , but it 's obviously incomplete . It 's incomplete ? What , you can 't feel it ? Yeah , yeah . Obviously something 's missing . I mean , it 's got no oomph . It 's incomplete . BIX : Think about it like a song . We have maybe half the stems here , so what we need is more tracks . More transmissions . A song ? I don 't know . DANNY : Look , dude . I got a mad genius here giving you gold . I mean , you give us , what , two , three days ? A week . A week , and he will crack this puppy . I don 't have that kind of time . Where do you gotta be ? That 's none of your concern . [ DANNY CHUCKLES ] [ SIGHS ] [ DANNY GRUNTS ] Curtis , look , you know , I do remember you . I do . You were the guy always sitting at the back of the class who was never asking questions . Yeah , because I was taking notes . Look , I have an idea . Let me take the scope on stage and mix the transmission live in front of an audience . What , in public ? No . Yeah . No . No , just listen to me . We 'll set it up as a prop . Nobody will be able to tell . No , but it 's not a prop , okay ? The Teslascope is very high-voltage . I don 't just press play , man . I mix my music live . I feed off the energy of the crowd . That 's how I make music . Now , you were right , this is important . And I believed in you . Now it 's your turn to believe in me . [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] Hey , hey . Everything is in motion . Poor guy won 't know what hit him . Seriously , you 've never done any drugs of any kind ? No . You might like it . Hmm . I 've seen what drugs do to people . Now , even Matthew . I mean , he 's changed since I knew him . He used to be a totally different person . How so ? I mean , he was the best in our class . That guy could literally build his own robot . Now he 's lost his way . He 's just living his life . Life 's not a party . Come on , we 're young . When else will you have this chance ? FLORENCE : Exactly . Get out of your head . [ MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] What are you doing ? Hey , the scope was gonna be off-stage . Don 't worry about it . This will be great . But we can 't let people see this yet , remember ? We agreed . You said that the , um ... The scope would be ... Curtis . You feeling okay ? Uh-huh . Yeah , actually , um ... Actually , I feel fucking great . That 's good . [ CHUCKLES ] But , hey , hey , we really- - We can 't show the scope here yet . Trust me . Come on , let 's go . This better work . [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] Normally that would be a wrap . But , you see , I got one more . I 'd like to dedicate this next song to my friend Curtis Garret . Sitting in the back , taking notes , it pays off , man . This is transmissions from another world . Transmission in three , two , [ BUZZING ] one . [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ] [ ¶ ] Matthew . Hey , hey . Dude , you were right . About the crowd . I mean , they boosted the signal . I could- - I could feel it . Hey , what 's wrong ? Nothing . Nothing . I just- - I thought I saw something , man . No worries . It 's all good , man . [ CHUCKLES ] [ ¶ ] [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] " ETXR : Transmissions From Another Realm . " I 'm feeling it , baby . I am feeling it in my sack . Yeah , in your money sack . Hey , hey , this is my money sack , baby . No , no , actually this is , right here . This is my- - BIX : Hey , careful , man . Come on , you seriously want me to believe these are signals from an alien intelligence ? Extraterrestrial , which means not of this Earth . I think it 's real . I can feel it . Did you ? Or maybe it 's a signal from a foreign government like China or North Korea or some shit . Do you ? Who cares where it comes from ? It sounds great . A lot of people agree . Do you feel that ? FLORENCE : Why is the view count frozen at 301 ? Of course I felt it . It 's just music . FLORENCE : It has over 20,000 likes . Holy shit , bro . Holy shit . We 're on the front page of Reddit . B , B , we 've gone viral , baby . What ? What ? Wait . No , no , no . Wait . What did you do ? BIX : What ? You uploaded the transmissions ? Relax , man , it 's not a big deal . I- - We don 't understand yet what this is and what it means . You can 't upload these fragments before we process everything . It 's not safe . Calm down , dude . They can trace this upload to our IP address . CECE : Curtis , what is it ? Curtis , man , you gotta talk to us . Okay , well , for starters , I got the original schematics from a server owned by the Department of Defense . DANNY : Whoa , whoa , whoa , hold up . We didn 't do anything illegal here , okay , pal ? Yeah , well , I have . And you 're all accessories after the fact . Oh , and the power cell that I used for the prototype ? I stole that too from a group of some not-so-nice people . Curtis . You stole what from who ? They . They ? That 's what they call themselves . Nothing else , just " They . " Like , " You know what they say . " They 're sort of a neo-eco-terrorist group that splintered off from the old Occupy movement , and they hired me to build an electromagnetic pulse bomb What ? so they could take down Wall Street . Jesus Christ . Come on . I wasn 't gonna build the thing , I just wanted the power cell . Wait . Terrorists ? More like anarchists . Okay , this is not what I signed up for . What the hell is he talking about ? You know , if they find me , they 're gonna kill me . Okay ? So I 'm dead . CURTIS : Why aren 't you listening to me ? BIX : I am listening . I came to you because I thought you 'd understand . I thought I could trust you . And I 'm not gonna screw you over on this . You already have ! These transmissions are not just music , okay ? They 're not . You 're right . I get that . No , no , no . You say that you do . You say that you do . But then you go behind my back and slap it up on YouTube so you can sell more tickets to your stupid shows . That wasn 't the point . That 's not what I- - The scope is mine , okay ? It 's mine . What ? No . I took all the risks . I built it . It 's mine . I am part of the equation , and we are gonna- - You 're not part of anything . You had the chance to be a part of something . Something real . And you wasted it on yourself . [ ¶ ] I 'm done . Okay ? No more music , no more transmissions , man . I 'm done with you . Curtis- - BIX : He 's out . DANNY : What ? I 'm telling you , man , there 's no talking to him . We got a huge show tomorrow night . It 's by special invitation . We need that scope , man . It 's done , man . Look , we gotta strike while the iron 's hot , okay ? I got Live Nation , Goldenvoice , Insomniac . They 're all called me because they wanna book Bix the Bug with the scope . Now , talk to your boyfriend . Get him to play ball , man . There 's gotta be a way . Come on . [ ¶ ] [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ ENGINE STOPS ] [ TAPPING ON WINDOW ] Curtis , do you really think that you 're better off alone ? I started this myself , I can finish it myself . You probably can . I admit , when I first heard that scope , man , I wanted those sounds for my music . But what happened at that show , I mean , that was real . I know you felt it . I was on drugs . I wasn 't exactly myself . Or maybe you were . Maybe for the first time , you let yourself go . Whatever you are running from , whatever you are afraid of , we can face it together . If we do this , we do this on my terms . Yeah . I wanna be there to supervise . Sober . You understand that ? Of course . And I need $ 20 for gas . [ ¶ ] Are you ready for this ? Yo , Bix . It 's showtime . [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] ANNOUNCER : It 's Bix the Bug ! [ ALL CHEERING ] [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] BIX [ VOICE DISTORTED ] : I am The Bug .

[ BUZZING THEN WHIRRING AND AUDIENCE CHEERING ] [ ALL CONTINUE CHEERING ] [ ¶ ] [ CHEERING ] Great fucking show , bro , huh ? What did I tell you ? What did I tell you , huh ? My phone has been blowing up , okay ? Promoters are calling . They wanna fly you to Hong Kong , Ibiza , Brazil . Ever see the girls in Brazil ? That was amazing . You crushed it . Thank you . I appreciate that . Have you seen Curtis ? No . No , haven 't seen him . Oh , he 's supposed to be here . Don 't worry about it . Maybe he 'll meet us after hours . Come on , let 's go celebrate . Yes . One second , ladies . One second , one second . Listen , we got that meeting set that I was telling you about . This guy Gordon Shafer , he wants to make us a serious offer . I 'm not doing that tonight . We 're doing it right now . I told you , I don 't wanna rush into this . Hear him out . It 'll take 10 minutes . I 'll give him five . Okay . I 'm so sorry . We have to take care of something . DANNY : Gotta go now . No . Don 't go . Sorry , ladies . Sorry . I 'll bring him right back . I promise . BIX : I 'll see you back at the pad . Listen , when Gordon Shafer makes an offer , you listen . Who is this guy , anyway ? I ain 't never heard of him . You 're acting like he 's some king of the world . He is . He owns like 50 percent of Europe . He 's the 1 percent of the 1 percent , all right ? Just don 't wear the high hat . Take my lead . MAN : Hey . Get the fuck out of the way . [ CAR HORN HONKS ] Play it again . [ ¶ ] Okay- - Please . Do I know you ? That sound . What was that sound ? Hey , pal . Look , pal , party 's over . Take a walk . Play it again ! I can 't . Hey ! Take a walk . No , no , no . It 's not from you . You 're empty . You 're an empty shell . You 're nothing ! Okay , congratulations . Thank you . Trick or treat . Bye-bye . Let 's go . Game face . Think big . Come on . Ah . GORDON : There he is . Bix the Bug . Ha , ha . I 'm Gordon Shafer . Congratulations . Today you 're being offered an opportunity to matter , to amount to something . Really ? I could use a drink . [ ICE CUBES CLATTER ] Help yourself , yes . You were saying ? I should very much like to have possession of your Teslascope . What will it take ? Name your price . Okay , hold on . Wait . Danny , did you not tell him ? DANNY : Tell him what ? It 's a prop . B , he 's making an offer . It 's a glorified synthesizer . It just makes sound vibrations . You don 't know what you have , do you ? This is precisely why it belongs in my hands , not yours . You lack the moral authority . When you look into the eyes of your fellow man , what do you see , hmm ? Just your own reflection ? Or do you sense a connection to something higher ? The Teslascope has the capacity to ignite a fire around which the world might gather for warmth and illumination , for connection . Well , Gordy ... Can I call you Gordy ? Is that all right ? To answer your question , no , it 's not for sale . I 'm still using it . For what purpose ? To make music . You 're like a little boy , aren 't you ? You 've stumbled upon a precious , sacred artifact , and you 're using it like a toy rattle to make noise . We 're done here . [ ¶ ] You 're out of your depth , Mr. Bug . On the wind come others , less kind and less inclined to offer fair compensation . Did you know , for example , that at this very moment , U.S. Department of Defense was monitoring your movements ? Bullshit . You think so ? He 's in a mood , Mr. Shafer . I 'll talk to him . We 'll discuss it . Move quickly , Daniel . You 're losing your grip . The clock is tick-tick-ticking . Are you kidding me right now ? Why would you turn down an offer like that ? Fuck that guy . He thinks he can own the world . He can 't own The Bug . He doesn 't give a shit about The Bug . All he wants to do is buy the scope . I give you our future on a silver platter , and you throw it in my face ? Yeah , what about Curtis ? What about Curtis ? We 're the ones who made the scope a thing , not him . The Scope is his . We 're not gonna sell it out from under him . Ever stop and think maybe Curtis is actually in trouble ? Are you kidding me right now ? What the fuck is it with you and this kid , man ? He 's a means to an end , all right ? Now , look , I 'm just following your lead . You don 't hear it ? Hear what ? It 's not just music , man . I hear music . I hear great fucking music . What are you hearing ? I don 't know . Twice now , I 've seen it . It 's always out in the crowd , watching me , man . What , like a ghost ? B , now you 're telling me you saw a ghost . Okay , you drink , you do drugs , you get in your groove up there , you 're supposed to see shit , okay ? I see shit , man . Stars , ecstasy , naked titties . It 's a fucking rave . Trust me , bro . Trust me . We sell that thing , man , you 're gonna see even better shit , okay ? Come on . [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ INAUDIBLE ] MAN : Give it back , man . Give it back ! [ CLANGING ] [ ¶ ] What the fuck was that ? Oh , Jesus , Danny . The scope . Oh , fuck . BIX : No , that 's Curtis . You see ? You see ? What did I tell you ? If he can 't have the scope , nobody else can , the little shit-fuck . BIX : Well , looks like he left , came back with friends . DANNY : All right , who the hell are these guys ? Maybe They , the guys Curtis was talking about . What happened ? Shh , shh . Shh . BIX : They 're looking for something . Oh , my God . DANNY : What the fuck ? These guys are fucked up . FLORENCE : Oh , my God . We gotta call our lawyer . I 'm on it . All right , and thank you so much . Okay . All right , bye . All right , that was the lawyer . He said give it a beat , see if our boy Curtis Garret shows up . After 24 hours , we could file a missing person report , or we could drop the whole thing . Drop it ? Hmm . CECE : They took him . We have the footage . Why aren 't we calling the police ? Not yet . We just need to take a minute , see if we can figure this out . Why ? [ GUNSHOT ] MAN : Everybody up ! Lay on the floor . Go get her . LEADER : Which one of you is Bix the Bug ? BIX : Who , whoa , whoa . I 'm Bix . This is my place . Hey , hey , hey . Bix . Bix . Hold on . Hey . What do you want ? Come with us . It 's gonna be all right . All right . Let 's talk about this . Okay . Okay . We don 't wanna hurt anybody . We just want something that belongs to us . You guys stay put , stay quiet , keep the cops out of this , we 'll get along just fine . [ ¶ ] What do you want from me , man ? What do you think ? The power cell . Power cell ? From the goddamn device . That Erector Set piece of junk . You mean the Teslascope ? Whatever you wanna call it . I 'm living in the real world , not some steampunk fairy tale . In the real world , there are makers and takers . And do you know what separates us ? BIX : No , but you 're probably gonna tell me . LEADER : Money . Money 's all gone , we 'll push reset . We 'll have to , to survive as a species . Economic collapse , that 's your plan ? That was the plan . Start all over , wipe it clean . Then your pal , Curtis Garret , got all Energizer Bunny on us and ran off with our Duracell . Solid oxide fuel cell technology , state-of-the-art . We want it back . BIX : Ask Curtis . I 'm asking you . Why can 't you ask Curtis ? Aah ! [ BIX COUGHS ] LEADER : Curtis told us it was in the device . I sent him up here to get it , he came back empty-handed . Said you must 've taken it . Well , I didn 't . So where is Curtis ? Let me talk to him . We 'll figure this out . What did you do to him ? This is what happens when you fuck with They . Things go wrong . [ ¶ ] He 's dead . Now it 's your turn , unless you come clean . One more time , where is the fucking power cell ? I don 't know , okay ? I don 't even know what you 're talking about . I don 't have it . I 'm just a musician . I 'm an audio engineer . I manipulate the sounds . Curtis built the scope . [ DOOR BUZZING ] What the fuck is going on out there ? [ DOOR BUZZING CONTINUES ] [ ¶ ] We got a shitload of people showing up . MAN : Go . What the fuck ? What is going on out there ? We had a show set for today . It 's just a bunch of kids . They 're just- - They 're looking for a party . We 're out of here . But we will be back for what 's ours . Find it . And the police better not get involved , or that 's your ass . You 'll all end up dead . Don 't fuck around . [ ¶ ] [ INAUDIBLE ] Yo , I sent out a tweet saying that Bix the Bug was playing a free show at this location . Lucky for you , my friend , we got a growing fan base . How can we not call the police ? BIX : Think about it . If we call the cops , they 're just gonna impound the scope . They 're gonna bring us up on charges , and then Curt will have died for nothing . DANNY : Okay , I 'm working on getting us private security as we speak . All right , so , what 's the story , okay ? Did this guy mention where this power cell thing is ? No . No , he never mentioned anything . Yeah , well , it sounds to me like he Doc Browned them . I 'm gonna go shit my pants right now . [ ¶ ] Can you fix it ? I don 't know . Okay , I 'm ... I 'm gonna take Flo home , man . She 's just gotta check in with her family , man . Be back in a little bit . Just do your thing , man . Do your thing , okay ? BIX : So you 're leaving . CECE : Yeah . I don 't know why you 're doing this . Doing what ? Just going on with the show like nothing happened . Come on . Curt , he would 've wanted me to see this through . Look , I don 't know what 's happening to me . All I know right now is that something in that room , it 's changing people . I need to fix it . I need to figure it out . It 's changing you . The way that you 're combining those sounds in there , people are drawn to them , but ... this is getting out of your control . [ THUDS ] The guy ... I can 't stop . Then I can 't stay . [ ¶ ] [ ¶ ] What are you doing here ? She 's right . You 're broken . You can 't fix yourself . You can 't fix others . You can 't fix anything . You 're a fraud . No , you 're wrong . I matter . There 's no one behind that mask . Who are you ? You can 't feel . You 've been behind a wall so long . That 's where you 're going to die . That 's where you 're going to die . DANNY : Yo , B. B. Hmm . You good ? Hey , Danny . Have any progress with the scope ? It 's close . But no cigar . Hey , look , all it 's gotta do is light up and look pretty . It doesn 't even have to produce any sounds . We can mix in the stuff that you already have . We got a huge show tonight . No , I know , man . I know . Cece 's gone . Looks like it 's just you and me , just like old times , my friend . I got the Beast out back . When are we gonna be ready to pack her up ? [ ¶ ] [ WHIRRING ] Whoa , nice , bro . It sounds like you got it going again . Yeah , the power 's up . We 'll see if she does anything . You should see these theories that these whack jobs are throwing out . " Government conspiracy , UFO , Egyptology . " Whatever the fuck that is . " Sacred geometry , astrology . " all the experts are chiming in on ET Radio . No way . Check this one out . Some asshole says : " When the horn of Gabriel sounds , it will set fire to the sky and the end of times will be upon us . " This is fucking great , man . Don 't I know you guys from somewhere ? What , you want , like , an autograph or something ? No , that 's okay . We 're fine , thanks . You can tell Shafer that there 's no deal . I 'm not gonna sell . We don 't work for Gordon Shafer . Then who are you ? We 're here to observe . Make sure nobody gets hurt . Like your friend Curtis Garret , for instance . You have a good show . DANNY : Did you see the heat those guys were packing ? FBI , NSA or DOD . I mean , maybe even- - Maybe even private contractors . Definitely Uncle Sam . You know , Shafer , he warned us . You still wanna go on ? Yeah . And even if they take the scope , I 'll still get one last run with it .

Curtis . I saw him . Where ? Somewhere . I ... I don 't know . Look , you took a big shock to the system , okay ? You 're not thinking right . Why don 't you just take a nap ? I 've been somewhere . Danny , I 've seen something I can 't explain . Settle down , all right ? Shafer was right . [ ¶ ] Shafer ? What do you mean ? The Teslascope . It has the power to change people . Danny , it 's changed me . Honestly , bro , sounds to me like you 're having a psychotic break . I mean , you 're drinking your own Kool-Aid here , man . No . No , I 'm not crazy . This is real . All right , well , let me ask you this . If this is so real , I 've been around the scope almost as much as you . How come I can 't see this big high dimension ? I don 't know . Maybe you 're not ready for it . So you 're telling me that music from this microwave over here is gonna make everybody all starry-eyed and see rainbows and unicorns and shit ? I don 't need you to believe me . I need you to help me finish it . If he was right about the scope , why not let Shafer protect it ? No , I can 't . I need to finish this . I need to put this out there . Shafer will keep it for himself . What if I told you he offered seven figures ? What ? One-point-three mil for the scope , as is . You did a deal behind my back ? Dude , it 's a no-brainer . That thing is way too much trouble , and a million bucks is too much money to fuck around . We 're getting rid of that thing . Danny . I can 't let that happen . No , it 's happening . It 's happening right now . It 's a done deal , okay ? How do you think I got the muscle to get us out of there ? Hey , hey , hey , I understand . What ? I understand why you want to sell the scope . But , Danny , we 're not dealing with this guy . Send him away . You 're a fucking piece of work , you know that ? Is there a problem ? No , man , there 's no problem . We 're just gonna iron out some last-minute details , okay ? BIX : The scope 's not for sale . We had a deal . DANNY : Whoa . Whoa , what the fuck is with the gun , man ? I 'm here to collect Mr. Shafer 's property . It 's not gonna happen . Look , man , you 're just gonna have to shoot me . [ GUNSHOT THEN GRUNTING ] DANNY : Fuck . [ ¶ ] DANNY : Are you hit ? We 're done now , Danny . What ? B , no , come on . B. [ ENGINE STARTS ] Come on , man . Bix . Yo , stop the car . All right , I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm fucking sorry , man . Don 't fucking leave me here . I 'm sorry , all right ? I said I was sorry . Bix ! [ ¶ ] [ CELL PHONE BUZZING ] Curtis . BIX : I knew you were alive . Can 't kill an idea . They did try , though . What about the picture ? It was a fake . CURTIS : They were just trying to intimidate you . Once I escaped , you were their only option . [ ¶ ] Hey . I 'm glad they didn 't shoot you in the head . Me too . I 'm sure they 'd like to . Yeah . [ ¶ ] CURTIS : We 've both been changed by what 's coming through that scope . It 's put us into a new reality , but I still don 't know what it 's leading to . BIX : The transmissions , they come in bursts , each on a different frequency . So far , I can see at least six separate tracks that are all meant to fit together as one . We 've only received five . Hey . There 's only two hours till dawn . Maybe you should take a break . No time for sleep . CURTIS : Whatever you say . MATTHEW : So can we finish it ? BIX : I don 't know if we can fix the scope . I tried , it almost killed me . CURTIS : The problem isn 't the power cell . It 's the scope itself . If the transmission comes in too hot , it just cuts the circuit . Can we control it ? CURTIS : There 's always gonna be a risk . We only control one side of the equation . BIX : We have to do it live , then . Stripped down . None of the extra lights . Just the scope . Yeah , but you said yourself , we can 't expose ourselves . They , the DOD . They can 't stop us once it 's out there . We could do it alone . Just drive off the grid , receive the last transmission , and then upload the final track , let the Internet do the rest . No , Curtis . It needs listeners . It needs consciousness . A tree falls in the woods , and there 's no one there to hear it ... Live , then . [ ¶ ] Are you ready for this ? Hey , still no sign of the feds or anyone from They , but there is a lot of people out there . Don 't worry , they 'll be here , even Danny . They all wanna see what happens just as much as we do . All right , so , what 's our plan of escape ? Well , if this works , we won 't need one . Yeah , but what if it doesn 't ? Then we 're wrong , nuts , and none of this bullshit matters . Oh , yeah , well , when you put it that way ... It 's almost time . This is it . Ow ! Okay , buddy . Heh . [ GROANS ] Thanks . Sorry . No , it 's okay . You 're a good man , Curtis Garret . [ ¶ ] [ ¶ ] [ ¶ ] Thank you for coming . Thank you all for listening . This is not from me . This is from someplace else . This is the completion . [ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] [ GROANS ] Transmission in 10 , nine ... BIX AND CROWD [ IN UNISON ] : eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one ! [ ¶ ] [ SCOPE STOPS ] [ WHIRRING ] [ ¶ ] [ ¶ ] [ WHIRRING FASTER ] [ EXPLOSION ] Bix . Look- - Aah . Okay . You all right ? [ GROANS ] Yeah . DANNY : Oh , come on . Bix . We did it . You did it . The rest is up to you , Curtis . Curtis ? Bix , it 's me . It 's Danny . Do you see it ? I do . I see it . That 's good . [ ¶ ] Okay .

Your name .. your name is that , sir . - What 's that ? Prince . - Your name is Prince , sir . Prince ? Prince ! This .. this house ? - lt 's your house , sir . Sir , you 've another house in the city . You often come here for weekends . Three days ago you phoned me from your house in the city .. .. and called me there . I 'd just reached the building compound .. .. when your that arrived . - What 's that ? Your car , sir . Your arm was bleeding . I asked you how you got hurt . But you scolded me , sir . On the way I asked you again .. .. whether we should go see a doctor . - -But you scolded again . Sir , you kept yelling at me all the way till we came here . And .. I hadn 't lost my memory then ? No sir ! You remembered everything . You said to me , Get that from the bedroom drawer . First-aid box ! I got it. I even bandaged you . - But you fell unconscious . - And when you regained consciousness .. .. you started strangling me . And before I could free myself and say something .. .. you fainted . I couldn 't tell you anything about your condition .. .. or the condition of your car . The condition of my car ? It 's in a bad shape , sir . Look .. bullet holes . Here .. and another one here . Two . Sir , I feel someone followed you and tried to kill you . Sir , between you and me .. .. there are only two types of people who fire bullets . First are goons , and second are them . The police . So , no doctor , no police . Right , sir ? 'Sir , you 've another house in the city . ' 'Your name .. your name is that , sir . - What 's that ? ' 'Prince . ' 'Sir , I think someone followed you and tried to kill you . ' Sir , can I get anything else for you . Fine , sir . PK .. what .. what do I do ? - You shift things around .

' 'l 'm reporting live .. ' ' .. from the headquarters of Wolf International . ' 'As you can see behind me .. ' ' .. a serious crime has obviously been committed here . ' 'But the police are refusing to give out any information . ' You said that I 've an apartment in the city . Yes , sir . It 's close-by . - Which way ? Left from the high-way . Let 's go , sir . Keep going , sir . Our building is ahead . Police . - Police ? No , sir . Everyone dressed in blue isn 't the police . They 're in orange jackets . The municipality . They must 've come to clear the garbage . They aren 't the police . - Yes . They 're much more dangerous than the police . Sir .. sir , can I go home ? - Go . Thank you , sir . Wait ! If I don 't come back home within 24 hours .. .. inform the police . Okay , sir . Who are you ? Prince . These are your mri scans . They 're all clear . Your nervous system is in perfect order . There are no marks of internal injury in your skull . All your blood tests are absolutely clear . You also remember everything .. .. that occurred for the past two days . Names of people .. .. addresses , how to drive a car , how to come here . You can do all daily chores . Then why did I .. suddenly suffer this memory loss ? The human brain is still a big mystery to medical science . Your case is strange , Mr. Prince . But trust me , I 'll try my best . But it will take time . You 'll have to be patient . Prince . I heard that you 're very fast . Today I saw it for myself . I 'm impressed . So am I . I don 't like wasting bullets . So , it 's better you don 't make any smart moves . Who are you ? And what do you want ? You 'll soon know what we want . Now , come on . Good work , Roy . And welcome to l-Grip , Prince . Indian Government Research and intelligence Portfolio . You might 've never heard about this unit of ours . You 're talking to Colonel Khanna , Bureau Chief . Let me come straight to the point , Prince . Where is that coin ? - Coin ? Which coin ? - The same antique gold coin .. .. for which you struck a deal with .. .. Sarang for 500 million rupees . Yes , we know . There are many ways of extracting information . So it 's better that you tell us quickly . Where is that coin ? I don 't know about any gold coin . So , you want to act tough ? Now get up , come on . Start the brain-mapper . Let 's load his memory . Take note of it . This is unbelievable , Colonel . He has only a day 's memory . Sir , how can it be possible . Try once more . Okay , try once again . Sir , this isn 't possible in medical science . But you know , Colonel , all the other information is missing . And it seems like he has .. - Like , he has .. .. used the coin .. on himself . Sir , it 's not working sir . I know that . But you keep trying . There are many people who are after this coin . We came all the way from India for this coin . It 's very difficult to hide this coin . Sir , he has just a day 's memory . I know , even I can see that . But , try once again . Sir , we should keep a strict watch on him . Maybe , he might remember something . Gradually , when his life and memory become normal .. Normal ? He 's Prince , Roy . His life was never normal , and it 'll never be . Take him . You 've lost your memory and the reason is that coin . So let me tell you a few important things . Sarang wanted to give you 500 million for that coin . You need to remember just one thing . You 'd that coin in your hands .. .. and you 'll soon have it again . Because , you aren 't doing this job alone . There 's someone with you . Your partner . - Partner ? When your partner contacts you , you tell him that .. .. that coin is worth much more than you thought . Sarang was offering you 500 . We 'll give you 1000 . Do you understand ? That coin is like God for you . And only that can save your life . But you 've only four days . No one can save you after four days . Not even God . Take him . Candy Club , 9pm . Maya . Sir , that 's Mr. Sarang . Your boss . Have you ever felt that I 'm not into import-export . But something illegal ? - Never , sir . Not at all . You 're a very nice man . Actually , sir , once I was in need of money . You gave me double of what I needed . Do you know of any girl called Maya ? Not any girl , sir , she 's your girlfriend . She works with you . In fact , you also said .. .. that you 're going to marry her . Do you 've Maya 's number ? How can I 've her number , sir ? It must be saved in your mobile . But it was lost that night . Maya . You dwell in my eyes . You inhibit my breath . All day and all night . The restless heart says . My heart craves for you baby , now . My heart craves for you baby , now . My heart craves for you baby , now . Let me come closer to you . There are burning desires . It 's difficult to spend these restless nights without you . Let me come closer to you . There are burning desires . It 's difficult to spend these restless nights without you . Life and death are meaningless without you . My heart .. for you baby , now . My heart .. for you baby , now . My heart .. for you baby , now . My heart craves for you baby , now . Excuse me . is there a Maya .. Maya . - Prince . I missed you so much . I thought .. I thought I 'd lost you forever . Oh , God. I was .. I was so scared . I was so scared . How is your arm now ? Are you seeing your Maya for the first time ? Prince , I 'm .. - l am .. I 'm sorry . Honestly , I don 't recognise you . Maya . You 've lost your memory . But not my love . I 'll remind you of our story . Those beautiful moments we spent together . 'But , someone jinxed your love . ' 'Sarang . ' 'The biggest white-collar criminal of Durban . ' 'But you were Sarang 's real power . ' 'His number one man . ' 'Only a few were fated to play with Sarang . ' 'But no one could win against him . ' 'We wanted to start a new life . ' 'A life that belonged only to us . ' 'And weren 't moments stolen from Sarang . ' 'You knew everything about Sarang . ' 'And only death could separate someone .. ' ' .. from Sarang who knew so much about him . ' 'But you were never scared of death . ' Maya , I 'm going to steal Sarang 's coin . - Coin ? Yes , Sarang 's coin . It was no ordinary coin . It was made in Sri Lanka , 3000 years ago . And it 's said that the gold it was created from .. .. came from Ravan 's chariot . And it 's also said that it has magical powers . You made a plan that after stealing the coin .. .. you 'd come home and pick me up . But that night , when I was waiting for you .. Hello . - Maya . Prince , where are you ? Maya , I 've been shot . - What ? Relax , I 'll be fine . Listen to me . I 've stolen Sarang 's coin . But his men are following me . Prince , are you fine ? I 'm fine , Maya . But you aren 't safe there . Get out of there immediately . Go somewhere safe . I 'll contact you later , okay . - But .. Maya , I love you . I love you too . Prince . I couldn 't do anything else but wait . Forget about Sarang , his coin and the money . You know , Ruby knows a bar owner in Cape Town . I 'll get a job there . Please . Please return Sarang his coin . So he can leave us alone . Right . I don 't have that coin . You said you 've hidden that coin somewhere . Only the coin can save us from Sarang , Prince . I .. I 've forgotten everything . And .. until I find that coin .. .. you 'll have to stay with Ruby . There are many people after me for that coin . I 'm not safe . I 'll contact you myself after I find the coin , okay ? Okay , but .. But , where will you look for the coin ? 'Sarang wanted to give you 500 million for that coin . ' 'There 's someone with you . ' 'That coin is like God for you . ' 'And only that can save your life . ' 'But you 've only four days . ' 'No one can save you after four days . ' 'Not even God . ' Hello , Prince . This is Maya speaking . - Maya ? Yes , Maya . - But I told you .. Look , meet me immediately at the boat club . Are you fine ? - Yes . I 'm waiting for you at pier number 4 . Come as soon as possible . Okay . - Maya ! Maya ! Pier number 4 ? Prince . Prince . Thank God you 're okay . I was so worried . How is your arm now ? I 've been trying to contact you for the past two days . But I couldn 't get through to your mobile . And you didn 't contact me either . Finally I spoke to Sarang .. .. and have taken 24 hours time . Anyway , we 'll need that much time . - Who are you ? What 's wrong with you , Prince ? I 'm Maya . Prince .. - You aren 't Maya . But you know that I 've lost my memory . And you 're trying to take advantage of it . Why ? Who are you ? What are you saying , Prince ? What 's wrong with your memory ? I 'm Maya . CBl officer Maya Malhotra . You 're Maya ? Prince . Prince ! What 's wrong ? Prince ! Your gun . Your Id . CBl officer Prince . CBl ? And this is your partner . I mean , mine . Officer Maya Malhotra . We 're working with the CBl chief , officer Khan . Now do you believe me ? These .. these id 's could be fake ! Fake ? Do you know what this is ? The map of Sarang 's house . And this is Sarang 's case file .. .. lt has all his details . We came here to get Sarang arrested . Operation ' Durban Under Cover ' . Stage one , winning Sarang 's trust .. .. and working with him . Stage two , collecting evidence against him .. .. and arresting him red-handed . But it wasn 't so easy to get to Sarang . Because Sarang is South Africa 's .. .. biggest white-collar criminal . And no one can lay a hand on him . That 's why we posed as thieves ourselves . And committed three high-profile robberies . Paris , Jakarta , and the Diamond Corporation of India . And after that Sarang noticed us . He contacted us .. .. and gave us a proposal to join him . Then he gave us the job .. .. of stealing an antique coin from the Cape Town Museum . Our plan was that .. .. after we steal the coin and deliver it to Sarang .. .. Officer Khan would arrest him red-handed . The Durban police was after us . Because they didn 't know that we were undercover . We parted that day , and met only today . We still have a lot left to do , Prince . And I can 't do it alone . I need you . One more thing . We aren 'tjust partners at CBl . We 're life-partners as well . Here 's the coffee . Without sugar and milk for sir . And for madam 'am , sugar and milk are separate . Right . You remember everything other than names , isn 't it ? What 's in the name , Maya madam ? Thankfully sir met you . Otherwise , I was going on answering his questions . Mad . - PK ! Okay , sir . That foolish servant of mine says that .. .. I work for Sarang 's company , Wolf International . An unknown girl says that .. .. Sarang is a gangster and I 'm his right-hand man . And now you . You say that I 'm an undercover agent for CBl . And I was gathering evidence against Sarang .. - Prince ! Sarang isn 't an ordinary gangster . He has offices all over the world . He operates from Durban . But he has connections with international cartels . I don 't know about the lie that girl has told you . All I know is that your life is in danger . Because Sarang has contacts from the ministry to the media . Sarang can go to any limits to wipe out his enemy . Regardless of what price he has to pay for it . Sarang gets everything he wants . And now his sights are on that coin . And it 's very important for us to find it , Prince . You don 't know how dangerous Sarang is . Any news ? - No , sir , nothing yet . Contact SERENA . Find out where Prince and his Maya are . That girl who was dancing here yesterday .. .. hasn 't she come ? There are many such girls who come here everyday . Do you know her address ? I don 't know her address . Your drink . This is my number . And this is yours . Call me if you find her address . Hello . Your lover was here . He was asking for your address . - What ? He has offered me 25,000 . Send 50 before the club closes down . - Okay . 'Hello . Welcome to News One. I 'm Pragya . ' Rahul Singh , son of infrastructure Minister Vinod Singh .. ' .. passed away in a plane accident . ' 'We 've learnt from reliable sources .. ' ' .. that Rahul Singh was testing his new private jet . ' - Sir . 'Rahul Singh 's close friend and business associate .. ' ' .. has expressed his condolences . ' - Mike . - Sorry , sir . We 've still not found out the reason behind this accident . For God 's sake , Priya , you know I 'm with Sarang . Shut up , Mike . This is an emergency , okay . We 're in trouble . Prince came back to Candy Club . - Oh , my God . Why .. why did he come there ? Tomorrow he 'll come here looking for me . Priya , I 'd told you before .. - Send 50,000 today to Tony .. .. before the club closes , okay ? Forget the coin , Priya . It isn 't easy to deceive Sarang or Prince . Mike . You know I 'm doing all this for us . You know I love you . Come here . What are you thinking about ? - About the coin . I 've found my Prince . So Prince will find his coin as well . I don 't want to leave . But I need to contact the department . They suspect you . And I need to ask Sarang for some more time . But don 't worry . I know , you 'll surely find the coin . Okay . Khan . I didn 't know you 'd be waiting here to welcome me . It 's such a happy occasion . The CBl was involved in the coin robbery . And you didn 't tell us that . Sir , I didn 't know that l-GRlP .. .. was interested in the coin as well . It 's clearly written in 1st August 's circular .. .. that l-GRlP is the highest authority . Higher than CBl . I 'm sorry , sir , but I didn 't read that circular . What happened in the coin robbery case ? Maya has located Prince . And we 're almost ready to nab Sarang . We don 't have anything to do with Sarang . We just want the coin , Khan . At any cost . - Fine , sir . The coin will be yours . But Sarang will be ours . Okay . You 'll have to keep me informed about whatever you do . Why just you , we should inform Sarang as well .. .. about the plan we 've hatched to nab him . Actually , why don 't we publish a newspaper ? Times of Crime . Khan , don 't act smart . Roy , I 'm smart . PK , try to remember . I want to know . The other night , did we stop anywhere ? Anywhere ? - No , sir , I 've told you so many times . That night , once we left from that house .. .. we stopped only after we got here , that 's all . Car . Hi , baby . - Maya , guess what . I found the coin . That 's amazing , Prince . - Yes , I know it 's amazing . Okay , tell me what we need to do next . Sarang is at his farm house at the moment , Santa Cabana . I 'll contact him and arrange for the coin 's delivery . Sarang will come with his men . And officer Khan will be ready with his men to nab him . There 's a place amidst the mountains .. .. where Sarang can 't hide . It 's called Wild Extreme . Everything is set . Khan is reaching with his team . Where did you find the coin ? In the heel of my shoe . Sarang . Prince , my number one man . I heard that you were shot . I was worried . Where 's the coin ? - Where 's our money ? Coin . Sarang ! No ! Leave me ! There 's something wrong , isn 't it ? How can everything end so easily , isn 't it ? Yes . Now I remember . Where 's your CBl team , Prince ? They haven 't arrived yet to arrest me . What was the name of that officer ? - Khan . CBl officer , Ali Khan . He hasn 't arrived . - PK . The police should 've arrived on time , sir . After all , how long can we criminals wait ? Right , boss . You 've run enough , Prince . Who will save you now ? Boss , wait . Wait please , this is a fake coin . It 's a copy . Give back the gun , Prince . What are you thinking , darling ? That how can Maya kill you ? But Serena can . Yes , Serena . Your Serena . WHO could 've done anything for you . Give me the real coin , Prince . Or I 'll kill you , I promise . Where is the real coin ? Sarang . Come on , move . Watch out ! Get them , I want them alive . I want them alive . Move , move Get into the car , quick . Overtake him , catch them . Come on , Prince , you can do it . It 's show time . Who are you ? Maya . Another Maya . Another story . So , what do you 've to say ? All I want to say , Prince , is that I love you . More than my life . I won 't tell you any story . I 'll tell you the truth . Neither are you Sarang 's right hand .. .. nor are you a CBl officer . You and I are professional thieves . We 've been working with Sarang for many years . The same old story . New twist. interesting . Go on . Few months ago we decided that we 'll leave this profession . And settle down . But .. it was very difficult to do that . Sarang 's organization is a one way street . And there 's no u-turn . We 'd only two options . Either we kill Sarang . Or .. get him arrested . We chose the second option . We contacted CBl Officer Khan . We offered him a deal .. .. that we can get Sarang arrested . But in return we want all our past criminal records wiped out . Khan agreed . A few days later Sarang gave us a job .. .. of stealing an antique gold coin . We got the opportunity we were waiting for . Attention all units , the package is moving . Be alert , I repeat , be alert . - Copy that . Send a request clearance at West and Aliwell . The plan was that .. .. when we deliver the coin to Sarang after stealing it . .. then Officer Khan would arrest him red-handed . The plan was foolproof .. .. as well as difficult . Eagle team to Alpha team . All seems clear up here . Unknown elements on the bridge . Eagle team to Alpha team . Unknown elements on the bridge . Copy that . All ground units full alert . I repeat full alert . Hold the convoy . Hold the convoy . Alpha team , clear the bridge now . Move out ! Move out ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Hey you , put your hands up in the air right now . Leader to Eagle One and Two . Take position . Take position . Eagle One coming into position . Eagle Two coming into position . I 've a clear shot . All units move up . Blue team , stay with the package . I repeat , stay with the package . - Put your hands up in the air . This is your final warning . It 's a hologram . Code red ! Code red ! Eagle One and Two do you see anything ? Speed boat approaching , look down , under the bridge . Copy that , take position . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - Move left ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Take position ! The package is down ! The package is down ! They 're getting away . Fire at will . Eagle one , do you 've a visual ? - Negative ! Negative ! Do you see anything ? 'We were successful . ' 'But we didn 't know that the coin and .. .. robbery will change our lives forever . ' Go on . I won 't tell you anything else , Prince . CBl Officer Khan will tell you the rest of the story . You should 've let me kill him , Sarang . Why did you stop me ? Serena , don 't make it personal .. ever again . Until we don 't find the real coin .. .. he has to stay alive . He 'll to die . You 've loved him for two years . So hate him for a few days . You 've just heard him sigh . He still has to bear a lot of pain . Lose a lot of blood . Okay , Charlie , let 's discuss this in private . Let 's discuss this in the common room . - Okay . Hello , Prince . I feel I 'll have to introduce myself again . Khan , Ali Khan . Actually , we 're very old enemies .. .. or shall I say friends . But this isn 't the time to rake up the past . Seeing your condition I 'm assured .. .. that Sarang has used the coin on you . Just one question . What the bloody hell is this coin ? I 'll tell you . Come . Lights . The biography of this coin starts from here . Date , 24th August , 2001 . Place , Gwalior 's Defence Research Laboratory . Characters , a team of chosen scientists from the country .. .. who were secretly carrying out research on Nano technology . And the most proficient amongst them was him , Mr. Ram . After 8 years , Mr. Ram attained success in his mission . The mission belonged to the l-GRlP . l-GRlP had spent millions on it . What was Mr. Ram working on ? Mr. Ram was making a path breaking memory chip . Through this chip human memory .. .. can be extracted on a computer disk . It can be altered and re-implanted in human brain again . Putting it in simple terms .. .. it means that through this chip .. .. you can change a man 's thinking . The memory of enemies can be altered .. .. and compel him to believe that .. .. he 's our friend and not enemy . The memory of a super intelligent person .. .. can be implanted into thousands of other people .. .. and they all can be made super-intelligent . A criminal 's memory can be altered .. .. and he can be turned into a nice man . The possibilities were immense . And also for the country 's defense . How .. how can that happen ? - lt has happened , Prince . With you . Two weeks ago when Mr. Ram .. .. was to make a presentation of this chip to l-GRlP .. .. but instead his dead body was found . And the chip and its software were missing . According to the team 's investigation .. .. this was the job of his assistant . He stole the chip and had fled to South Africa . l-GRlP 's intelligence found out .. .. that he has struck a deal with someone called Sherry . Sherry is a famous antique dealer .. .. who operates from Cape Town . And Sarang 's biggest rival as well . He deals in defence secrets and arms-smuggling . Sherry knew what this chip was worth . He sent word to his international buyers .. .. about this chip . And made an intelligent plan to sell it . Sherry would often sell defence secrets .. .. covertly in his priceless antiques .. .. through auctions in Durban . And that 's why he .. - He hid this chip in a antique coin . Exactly . The plan was that chip was to be sold .. .. in Durban 's auction . So that the deal is official and .. .. the buyers can easily take the chip out of the country . Sherry arranged to send the coin .. .. from Cape Town to Durban along with his other antiques .. .. under the protection of the local police . Sherry 's plan was good .. .. but he didn 't have one thing which his biggest rival had . You two . The most cunning and professional thieves in the world . When we stole the coin we didn 't know .. .. what was inside it . The coin was in our hands .. .. and Serena was standing before us . Either Sarang grew suspicious of us .. .. or he didn 't want to take any chance with the coin . That was the reason .. .. why we couldn 't contact Officer Khan . We didn 't know that fate will play a cruel game with us .. .. that will change our past , present and our future . You should only play the games you can win . Whatever the game .. .. you should know how to win . Let 's shake hands . The coin is in my hand , the cash is in yours . At the moment , everything is in my hands . Coin . Prince , my number one man . What deal has officer Khan offered you .. .. to get me arrested ? I want to shoot you right now . But when a weapon becomes rusty .. .. we don 't break the weapon , we clean it . You 've done a greatjob for me , Prince .. .. by stealing this chip . You know what this chip is ? I can make the entire world bow at my feet with this chip . I can rewrite lives with it . Starting with you . Mike . Today I 'll clear the rust in your head . Erase all of Maya 's memory from his mind . Don 't leave anything , Mike . I want a Prince that lives only for Sarang . Every step he takes is for me ! I want Prince .. my number one man , . Mike , don 't ! Don 't do this , Sarang , you 'll regret it . Relax , Maya . It 's my turn to say to you its show time . We .. we 're ready , sir . Take a look , Maya . Prince has lost all memories of you . Next time when he wakes up .. .. you won 't be part of his memory or his world . Stop ! Nobody moves . Give me the chip , Prince . You 're making a big mistake . You 're making the mistake , Sarang . Maya was right . You 'll regret it . Move . Come on , move ahead . Move ahead . Keep moving . Keep moving . Go . No ! Prince ! Before we separated .. .. we 'd decided that we 'll meet at the beach house . But when I reached there I saw that .. .. P.K was already there . I understood that Sarang has still not found the coin . They were still looking for that coin . I kept observing you slyly .. .. so that you aren 't in danger from Sarang . And waited for the right moment to contact you . That means I remembered everything .. .. even after we separated . But .. Mike had erased my memory with the help of that chip . Just like after deleting software from a computer .. .. we need to restart the computer to clear all the traces . Similarly .. .. you 'd an image of your memory in your brain at that time . When you slept at night and woke up in the morning .. .. all the images were cleared . Its notjust the question of that coin any longer .. .. its also concerns the national security now , Prince . And now you 're a part of it as well . Do you think he has met Khan ? I know he has met Khan . Then he must 've found out everything . If he knew everything .. .. he would 've come running to me . Because if he doesn 't come see me .. .. then tomorrow will be Prince 's the last day . Prince . There 's something I didn 't tell Officer Khan . That day you sent me a voice mail . Maya. I 'm safe . I 've hidden the coin . Gandhiji 's looking after it . Maya , remember the letters . But .. what does it mean ? I sent this message from some landline . It must be a payphone . We should track it down . I 've already tracked it down . This phone booth is on Osborne Road . Let 's go . Maya , in the message I said .. .. I 've handed over the coin to Gandhiji . Nelson Mandela is considered .. .. the Mahatma Gandhi of South Africa . Right ? Maybe the coin is inside this . Okay , I suggest that you go out and keep a watch . I 'll open this . The coin isn 't in these . This is our arms room . And this is where we 've planned all our high-tech robberies . Thank God you didn 't tell P.K about this . Prince . That 's no ordinary lC . They 're high-power tracking devices . And this is the .. receiver . Come on , move . - Jack , check in the kitchen . One guy go inside . Yes . - Boss , you were right . Maya and Prince were coming here . We followed them as well , but .. - But you lost them . Right , boss . If you don 't find them by morning .. .. then you 'll be missing as well . Come on , guys , let 's go find them . Come on , move it . There 's a small thing hidden in this big city . And everyone 's after it . You 'll .. find it . Okay . What does this coin look like ? How does it look ? Just like the fake one . Which you gave Sarang . - Right . But , why did I hide that fake coin in my shoes ? Not you , I did . I kept that fake coin there . You ? Serena had weaved her web of deceit all around you ! You believed that she was Maya . You would 've have never believed me .. .. if I 'd contacted you at that moment . That 's why I hid that fake coin in your shoe . But it was late . Too late . I promise you , Maya . I 'll find that coin . For you . Good morning , Prince . Don 't be so surprised . I was waiting for you to get up . How do you say this ? Life is too short . You must know everything about the brain-mapper now . Everything . But there 's one defect that still remains . And the effect of that defect is .. .. that your memory is erased each .. .. time you wake up from your sleep . And the symptoms of this memory erasure are .. .. nausea , temporary blindness and headache . And if your memory isn 't reloaded in your brain .. .. then your brain will keep crashing like this . It can lead to brain hemorrhage . Sudden death . In this condition you could live for six days . Today is the sixth day . In fact , you 've only eight hours left now . Find the coin .. And take your memory back from me . I 'll not kill you , Prince , Just give me the coin . Prince. I don 't you want to die . At least , you not without your memories . What are you doing , Prince ? Mahatma Gandhi Post Office . Osborne Road . It 's on the same road . Mahatma Gandhi Post Office , in Durban ? Maya , I think this could be it . We should go check it out . Maya . All the safe-deposit lockers .. .. have six digit numbers on them . Every locker has six numbers . I said in my message that Ghandhiji 's looking after it . And Remembers the letters . Right ? - Right . Gandhi . Six letters . Give me your phone . Quick . Gandhi . 426344 . We 're looking for 426344 . 426344 . Come , let 's go . Hi . - What can I do for you , Sir ? We 'd like a safety deposit box . - That will be 50 Rands . Here . Please fill up the form . is it possible to get 426343 ? I 'll just check for that , sir . 426343 , please . You 're in luck , sir , it 's vacant . Thank you . May I ? - Sure , sir . Maya . Security cameras . Cover me . I kept awake the entire night , just for you . With tearful eyes and heavy heart , just for you . I waited just for you . I forsook the world for you . I built heaven just for you . I forsook God just for you . I built heaven just for you . I forsook God .. Just for you . I sway crazily just for you . I promise I 'm only for you . Don 't ever leave me . The imbued night . In your company , I feel intoxicated . Let 's erase these distances . Come closer to me . Touch me slowly . Let me be forlorn in your love . Take me in your arms . Just for you . I sway crazily just for you . I promise I 'm only for you . Don 't ever leave me . Your fragrance is all around . In my search for life . Every moment .. I felt you close . My dreams gestured me .. let them dwell in my eyes . I 'll feel relieved . If you make a gesture to them . Just for you . I sway crazily just for you . I promise I 'm only for you . Don 't ever leave me . Just for you . I sway crazily just for you . I promise I 'm only for you . Don 't ever leave me . I kept awake the entire night , just for you . With tearful eyes and heavy heart , just for you . Prince . Sweet . The road ends here , Prince . The coin , please . Prince . Prince . Prince . Prince . Sarang did a terrible thing with you . If it had been me .. It would 've been far worse for you . Sherry . - Good . Now I don 't have to tell Prince that .. .. you stole that coin from me . Come on , Prince , be a good boy . And give me my coin back . One arrow and two targets . Maya . Guys , get ready . Maya ! Maya ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on , move . Come on , hurry up . Hurry up , come on , move , move . No ! Prince ! Darn . Bloody hell . - What happened ? He doesn 't have the coin . We didn 't find the coin and abducted Prince as well . If he doesn 't have the coin .. .. then Maya must have it . And Maya will give us the coin to save her Prince . Yes , she 'll give the coin . And one day , she and Prince together will kill us . Will you shut up ? Sherry was going to pay us 100 million for that coin . Sherry . Sherry is dead . - So what ? Now Sarang will pay us . Serena , where are they ? - They fled . Let 's go . Mike . Hello , Mike . No , Priya. I know you 've the coin . But before you go to Sarang .. .. you 'll have to come to me . Sarang has the brain-mapper . What do you 've ? - Me ? I 've Prince . Maya , where are you ? Officer Khan , I 've found their location . Maya , we need the coin . You 'll get it . But first I need to save Prince . The location is .. - Just a second . Okay . - Yes , tell me . Ushaka Sea World . Sea Point . Two of them . Okay , Maya , we 'll be there in a while . You just hold fort , okay . Found them . Let 's go . The coin . And your gun . First tell me how you can save Prince 's life ? I 've a copy of the brain-mapper software . Which I took from Sarang 's laptop . It 's the question of Prince 's life . How can I trust you ? You 've to , Maya . You 've to . Sarang wanted to kill Prince .. .. as soon as he got the coin . I made this copy to save Prince 's life . Please , Maya , believe me . Prince has very little time . Gun . Let me see , darling . The coin that 's responsible for all this , how does it look ? Priya . Prince has very little time . Please , Baby , I just .. I just want to see it . Thank you . What are you doing , Priya ? Give me back the coin , Priya .. You 're so stupid , Mike . What did you think .. .. a girl like me can fall in love with an idiot like you ? There 's just one idiot in this room . And that 's not me . I 'll shoot if I 've to . Bye , loser . Priya was right . You 're a loser , Mike . Don 't worry , Maya , Prince will be absolutely fine . I 'm not a loser , I 've the real coin . I 'd learnt about Priya 's greed long time back . So , which coin was that ? The same duplicate coin that you gave Prince .. .. and Prince gave to Sarang . If I can steal the entire brain-mapper software .. .. from Sarang 's laptop , can 't I steal a coin ? Okay . This is it . Here goes . You 're incomplete without your memory , Prince . And I 'm incomplete without you . Come back , Prince . Or else .. or else , we 'll lose this battle . Come back , Prince . Please . Come back , Prince . Come on . Come on , Prince . Come back . Maya . - Please . Come back . Mike . Save me . Priya ! No ! Maya , no . Maya . No ! You 'd one chance to live . But , maybe , you 're in a hurry to die . Serena . Sarang , we know you 're here . But there 's no escape for you this time . Do you hear me ? No escape Sarang . Put your hands up . And come out , one by one . Go , go . Wait . Prince . Prince .. I .. I .. I 'm sorry . Sarang , Prince . Let him go . We 've the coin . Go . They 've reduced firing . Looks like they 're running out of bullets No , Sarang is fleeing . From behind . Don 't worry , Prince . We 'll soon find out Sarang 's location . Colonel Khanna has gone after him . Colonel Khanna didn 't go after him . He went with him . What the .. Blanks . There were no bullets in any of l-GRlPs ' guns . That means we were wrong . We were wrong the whole time . Sarang had already bribed Khanna . He 'd all the details . He knew bloody everything . And now .. now we 've lost him . Trust us , Officer Khan , we 'll find him . - How ? We just won 't be able to find him now . We 'll . Wherever Sarang has gone , he must have worn his shoes . I 'm sorry , but sometimes .. .. good news comes to those who wait for it . Do you 've the coin ? - Yes . And very soon you shall have it . Sarang . - Yes . Where are we going ? is it safe ? I 'm safe . Don 't know about you . - What ? Just kidding . Look outside , Khanna . This is Sharakiya . The point between the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .. .. which is no-man 's land .. But belongs to everyone .. .. there 's a base-camp located seven kilometres from here . Here you can find every weapon .. .. from every country . But no weapon of any country .. .. can locate us here . Tell Khanna that Prince can locate you anywhere . How did you find out about my location ? Ask your shoe , Sarang . - Shoe ? It 's show time . Rogue . Sarang , coin . Captain , down , down . Prince ! Subtitled by [ n.W.o ] [ new World order ]

 Where to pal ? OH ! Sorry , father , I ah ... I didn 't see ... I ... eeesh ... East side rescue mission ? Fancy , you got Kevlar under that shirt ? What did you do to piss off the boss ? Thought I worked for a different boss . Oooh more courage to retreat than advance in this army . Oi , traffic , is beyond my control . You think maybe you could in a good word for us ? It 's my lot in life . One man 's hell is another man 's pay check . You know , father , you and me , we are lots alike . We are both trying to get people where they need to be , and everyone thinks we are trying to rip them off somehow . Night like this you just want to go to your warm happy place . Hey , father , do priests have the warm happy place ? Oh ! Do you mind father ? It 's my wife . Hi mom , how you doing ? What are you doing Andrew ? I 'm at the cabin . I wanted to try spey casting . I remember Dad always talked about it and I thought I 'd give it a shot . Andrew this is not the time for fishing . Maybe not but , here I am . Andrew I can 't believe you , you are facing excommunication and you 're trout fishing ? I 'm not being excommunicated mom , I 'm just being relocated to a Christian mission . It 's a soup kitchen Andrew you 're being banished . Well consider it self improvement then . What do you mean Andrew . You know tithe saying ... " give a man a fish , feed him for a day , teach a man to fish ... " ? Andrew , please , I don 't want to lose you . You 're not losing me mother , I 'm still a priest . Oh come on ! It 's the pedal on your right you son of a ... sorry father . Hey father , my wife , she thinks that nurses and doctors are better at sex because they know so much about the body . So me , I wonder , what are priests better at ? Are you better at being happy that regular people ? Call the Bishop , he 'll understand . They won 't understand . That 's exactly the problem . Everything you 've worked for , all these years , is hanging in the balance here . You need to earn their forgiveness . God may be forgiving , mom , but men aren 't . Don 't worry , I 'll be fine . How can you say that as you turn your back on God , on me ? I 'm not turning my back on anyone . This wasn 't your fault , Andrew . You didn 't push him off the ledge . Maybe not , but he died with my hand on his shoulder . He looked to me for guidance . Of course I do , it 's your fare . Look , father , either I cut over on fifth to pacific , which is longer route , or we are stuck in this game traffic until tomorrow night . Oh ! uh ! Yeah , uh . Cut over . Hey , sometimes the longer route gets you the quicker end . Either way , it 's better than waiting for it . Okay ! Hey Lady , I am coming over . One way or the other ! You can 't let an accident ruin your life . Suicide by definition is not an accident , mother . He killed himself Andrew . You didn 't kill him . Yeah , well , he looked to me for guidance . All he wanted was understanding ; acceptance . So because of his choices you 're going to let it damn your soul too ? Mom , calm down . It 's okay . How can you say that ? Do you understand what you are saying ? What you are talking about ? I am trying to save your soul . My soul is my problem . I 'm your mother , it 's my problem . HEY ! No . No . No . You want money ? You go help sewer guys fix flood . What are you ... ? Man this guy is killing me , come on ! OH ! Whole world is for shit . Sorry father , no offense . None taken . Black president was supposed to change the world . Make everything equal . Some things just don 't change , human nature . I used to give these people money . When I first came to this country I see this lady she had a sign it said she was starving . So me , I gave her my sandwich . And the next day , she 's still there . But me , I am hungry so I gave her half of my sandwich . And then she is still there . Poof , what are you gonna do ? I gotta eat too . The Lord helps those that helps themselves . Exactly The Lord helps those that helps themselves . The Lord helps those that ... that 's a little cold don 't you think ? But true . Oh , you have to get through his Andrew . It 's not that simple . Andrew you 're in danger here you can 't be cryptic . I 'm not trying to be cryptic . It 's not something you can just get over . He needed me . He was desperate . All he needed was acceptance and I ... I couldn 't give it to him . Why ? Because of some rule of my job ? Because it 's written that homosexuals are sinners . Written by who , mom ? God , Andrew . Are you sure ? Are you sure God wrote those words ? How sure ? Because I 'm not . And do I speak the word of God ? Don 't you blaspheme to me your father would turn over in his grave to hear you say such things . I 'm not blaspheming mom . ... It 's ... God isn 't the problem . I used to make sense . I need to figure things out . By turning your back on God ? I 'm not turning my back on God , mom . Andrew this is what you have wanted your whole life . You are throwing it away . Why don 't you call the Bishop ? Call the Bishop ? Because I ... Because why ? Because . Even if he would change his mine about what I did it 's not about his approval . Well what is it then ? If I call him , I have to mean it . Well of course you do . Faithful , mom , that 's what it says . It 's the first requirement . How can I go back if I don 't have that ? How can I ? By finding your way back to your faith , son . I 'll try . Look , I got to go I love you mom . And I love you to . Bye . Even with the two traffic jams , looks like we find it . You sure you want to do this father ? The pimps and the thieves , it 's not the worst of it , believe me . Look I 'll take you anywhere else you want to go . . I got to go back up town anyway . Father , whatever you did , it 's not written in stone . Come on , last chance , anywhere you want to go , free fare . Thanks . Okay , stretch your legs according to your clothes . Hey , remember , Father , words without thoughts , never to heaven go . Be your best . God bless you . Deos beatus nos totus abbas . Andrew , I was begining to worry . Come on in , father , welcome to our little haven in the shade .

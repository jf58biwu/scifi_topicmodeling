However , Francois Deleruyelle , the amateur astronomist who first spotted the light , has already attracted a lot of interest after his emphatic claim that the object is headed directly towards Earth . Empty the fucking till . Yeah , okay ... Hurry up ! Okay ! Okay , okay ! Hurry the fuck up ! For fuck 's sake , hurry up ! Is that everything ? That 's everything ! Are you sure ? I swear . You full of fucking shit ? No ! That 's everything , I swear ! No it 's not . And the rest . But I swear , that 's all I 've got ! Think I 'm fucking stupid ? Get some more ! No ! You got more down there and I know it ! But that 's all I 've got ! That 's all I 've got ! Please just take it and go ! Are you fucking kidding me ? No ! Get your fucking safe ! Look , I 've not got a safe ! Aye , bullshit ! Get your fucking safe . Look , I 've not got a safe ! Please , just take the money ! Get my bag and get the fucking safe open ! I 've not got a fucking safe ! You fucking lying to me ? No , I 'm not lying ! Please , just take the money and go ! You 're fucking lying to me . Look , please just take the fucking money ! Get down there and fucking get it ! I 've not got a safe , please go ! Please ... I swear , I 'll fucking do it ! Please , please , just go ! It 's a fucking gun in your fucking face . Please !

We 'll just calm down ... You . Wallet . Now . And what if I don 't ? What are you going to do ? Put a bullet through your head . That 's what . Fucking no , please , let me just fucking go please ! No you won 't . You 're not going to do that . What , things haven 't worked out well for you so you think that gives you the right to come in here and wave a gun in people 's faces ? Why don 't you go and fuck yourself ? Wallet now , or I swear to God I will fucking kill you ! Please , just fucking give him your wallet . Please give him your wallet ! Just go ! Fucking hell , man . You 've got the money . Go ! Just give him it . You could probably do anything you want . You know that ? If you 've got money problems , why don 't you go and get a fucking job ? Oh , I know why . 'Cause You 're too much of a pussy . A pussy ? Yeah . A pussy . You 've got two fucking seconds . Do you want to shoot me ? Go ahead you fucking coward . Do it ! It 's alright , it 's alright . Shh , shh , shh ... Please help me , please don 't let me , please don 't ... It 's alright , it 's alright . 999 , what 's your emergency ? Hello ? Yeah , I need , I need an ambulance . Some fascinating things coming out from some of the calls today . I mean , if all we really have to think about is , where , where were we tens of thousands of years ago when this asteroid began its journey ? Hey . I 've been trying to call you for two hours . Where are you ? I 'm at the , um ... It doesn 't matter . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Um , I could do with a drink actually , if you fancy it . Of course I fancy it . Why do you think I was calling ? It wasn 't for your stimulating fucking conversational skills . Okay , where are you ? I 'm in the white swamp , but I 'm just moving on to somewhere else . I 'll text you the address . Right . As long as it 's not another house party , okay ? I just want a quiet drink . Hi , this ls Richie . Leave a message and I 'll call you back . Hi mate . It 's me . I 'm here . Where are you ? I 'm downstairs . Don 't even know if I 'm in the right house . Call me back . Please do help yourself . This yours ? It is . That 's alright , I forgive you . At least you 've got good taste . It 's wasted on that lot . One for the road . I bought it back from Venezuela . You ever been to South America ? No . Uh , not yet . I 'm Maya . Cole . Nice to meet you Cole . That 's a cool name , eh ? Whose name ? The astrologists . Astronomist 's , whatever it is . De-LA-Royale . Deleruyelle . Deleruyelle . Huh , first name or a last name ? I think it 's his last , but it works for either . Deleruyelle Jones . Deleruyelle Goldstein . He sounds like a Jewish coventry detective in a 19608 crime novel . Sounds more like a porn star . I mean , what do they say ? A 0.00001 % chance it 's going to hit us ? Mm . You know , you can see it now . Are you serious ? It 's been visible since Wednesday . Someone 's a little bit self-involved . It 's been one of those weeks . I 've been having all sorts of ... Hey , I 've got my own problems . Do you know what would be the best problem solver of all time ? If we knew with absolute certainty that thing was going to hit us . I mean how liberating would it be without any doubt it was actually going to smash right into us . Nothing would matter . Um , everything would matter . Why would it ? Well , I 'd agree with you if they were going to hit us in three days . If they were three days away , there would be nothing we could do to prepare . We could just forget about all of life 's problems and money and bullshit and have fun . Now that would be liberating . This thing 's what , three years away ? Two years , 291 days . Wow . What a nerd . Thank you . So if it was definitely going to hit us but it was two years , 290-whatever days away , I think it would be the opposite . We 'd all be so burdened with the responsibility of having to survive . We 'd be so preoccupied making plans to survive annihilation ... That we would never be able to just sit back and enjoy it . Exactly . This is getting pretty deep . Mm , you started it . So who do you know here ? That 's slightly embarrassing . I was here to meet my friend , Richard . Richie . He 's upstairs . Disappeared into one of the bedrooms with a girl dressed like Princess Diana . Ah . Okay . Well , in that case , you 've got me . I don 't know anybody . You know me . Except for you . So I know you don 't work with Richie . What do you do ? Well , h-how do you know that I don 't work with Richie ? Because your hands don 't feel like you 've been counting money your whole adult life . Well , I 'm just doing a bit of manual labor at the moment . Geez , don 't bore me with the details , will you ? I work on a building site . A building site . Yep . I notice You 're avoiding using the word " builder . " Yep . It 's alright . I get it . I sometimes pour pints at my dad 's pub for some extra cash . It doesn 't make me a bar maid . Maya , you coming ? No , I 'm going to hang around for a little while longer . It was nice to meet you . It was great to meet you guys . Cheers . See ya . See ya . God . Wouldn 't expect those two to get together , would you ? Jesus and Hitler ? You know , I think he was after a threesome . Well , I think he would be lucky . I only met them half an hour ago . That 's all it takes . Is it ? Put this on . I don 't think so . Don 't give me that look . God ... You serious ? I 'm so turned on right now . Aha , this smells of , um , feet . So what did you actually want to be ? Well , I trained to be a carpenter . Oh , like Jesus . Ah , exactly like Jesus . Well , just don 't go making your own cross . Ah . Smile . I love this . Turn it up ! Come on Geppetto . Are you serious ? Yes .

I 'm not staying in here . It 's for your own safety . Can 't just keep me locked up in the dark all day . I 'll get scurvy . You get rickets from not getting enough sunlight . Oh , I 'm sorry .

What , are you my grandmother ? Barry Gruberman . Why do I know that name ? He had a map . Not this ... He was heading to Norway . I can 't keep having this same conversation . That 's where all the evacuees were heading . Yeah , where ? They said if you get to an evacuation center , then refugee boats are leaving for Norway . And how long ago was that ? How do you even know it 's still safe ? Well , if it doesn 't get dark , then ... Oh , here we go . There 's a reason they call it the land of the midnight sun . That 's where she is . I know it .

Sorry I , I can 't stand white wine , and it makes me depressed . Well why didn 't you say ? Because I nearly threw your stuff up at the party ... If there any alcohol you can drink ? I don 't know . How about something non-alcoholic ? What about a nice Shirley temple ? Listen , trust me , I-I drink everything else . Red , red wine , beer , vodka ... Mm , my God , I can 't believe I forgot to tell you . Do you remember Chloe and Steve from the party ? You know , the guys I was going to get a lift back with ? Um ... The threesome . Ah . Sexy Hitler . Sexy Hitler . Well , when they left , they got in a taxi and they ended up in a head-on collision with a lorry . They all got killed . The driver as well . Hang on , fuck I read about that . That was them ? Yeah . Fuck . I know . Mm . Hmm . Go on , you can say it . What ? You know what . You 're dying to say it . Say what ? You know what . I 'm not saying anything . But , it 's true though isn 't it . I knew it . If it weren 't for me ... You 're evil ! You 're welcome . Yeah , okay , thank you . Thanks for ... Saving my life . Yeah , well , listen , it was , it was no sweat . My hero . I know . It 's the , um , it 's the , the Pesto . I went , I went fucking mental with the Pesto . Hm . Did you make this ? I said I trained as a carpenter . I didn 't say I was any good . You know what ? I love it . Must be the floor that 's uneven . The floor is uneven . It is . Really ? And two slippery supernovas please . What 's a slippery supernova ? Half vodka , half whiskey with a coffee bean in it . God almighty , I am starting to think you 've got some serious problems . I do , I do . I need help . That 's £ 14.75 please . Oh am I ... I 'm paying . Good . Alright . He 's paying . She orders , I pay . That 's it . After Pestogate , you 'll be paying forevermore . Just establishing the boundary , you know that ? I 'm so sorry , he 's an alcoholic . Yeah , well done . He beats me . I 'm her , don 't say that . Out on my arms . Come on now , Maya . Don 't say that . It 's not true . It 's ... And he picks his nose and eats it . It 's ... That 's , that is true . Locks me up in the shed . This is where my mom and dad first met . Really , in here ? Mm . She worked in the bar , and he 'd come in every other day and try and chat her up . And wore her down eventually . I think that 's why he wanted his own pub . He 'd seen the woman behind the bar with the customers in the palm of her hand , you know ? Mm . Can you imagine how busy this would 've been back in the day . Mm . If you could go back in time to any point in history ... Ancient Rome . Really ? Yeah . I think so . Coliseum , right ? I 'd love to see the gladiators . Two men fighting to the death . Is that weird ? Bit weird . Is it ? How about you ? Ancient Greece . For the togas . Togas . Did you hear about the dyslexic who went to a toga party dressed as a goat . Oh my God . No ? No . I actually got a broken nose once . All due to time travel . Amazing . What for ? Yeah , I was quite drunk . Ah . And there was this kid , who was about ten years old . Oh , dear God , where is this going ? So anyway , I was very drunk , and I saw this kid , and I was like , he was just a mini version of me . And it might 've been because I was hammered , but he literally looked like the spitting image . Right . So , I crossed over the road , went over to him , looked down , looked in his eyes , deep into his eyes . And I said " I 'm you from the future , and I 've got a really " important message for you . " Whatever you do , don 't get on that boat . " What boat ? I don 't know , I 'm making it up . And what did he says ? He ran off , screaming . Wow . And a few days later , walking down the same street , in fact , he was there with his dad , but his dad was clearly devoid of any sense of humor , so , dosh ! Oh no ! Yeah . I looked way more like that kid than his dad anyway . Do you ever want kids ? No . No ? No . That urge has never really kicked in . You ? Cue the violins . Oh . I , I can 't have children . Don 't stop for God 's sake . I had an abortion when I was 18 , and there were some complications but ... You know , I was ... Totally fine with it , so ... Don 't you dare tell me you 're sorry . Oh , no , I wouldn 't dream of it . There are way too many people in the world anyway , right ? Last thing we need 's another you running around . But you know what I realized the other day ? Time travel will never be invented . No ? Why ? Well , if it was going to be invented at any point , then we 'd have met someone from the future already , wouldn 't we ? Not if they could only travel forward . Anyway , we might 've met people from the future . Hmm . Yeah , they 've probably got very strict guidelines about what they can say . Maybe . Ahh ! What ? Just talk to me . Hey . Ahh ! How did you get out ? Go back . You go back . Shh , w-we need to keep quiet . It 's daytime . What are they going to do ? Maya . Hey ! Maya . What are you going to do ? Maya be , come on , then , beam me up ! Keep quiet ! Shh , Maya ! Come on ! There 's nothing in here . We could 've eaten that deer . Not unless you like it with green shit all over it . What , you mean like Pesto ? Do you think they regret coming here all at once ? What do you mean ? Mm , they fly fifty billion light years to get here , then they can 't cope with daylight . It 's like going on the Costa del Sol and realizing you were allergic to dickheads . They 're not on fucking holiday . Well how do you know ? Because when you go to the Costa del sol you don 't enslave and slaughter all the locals . You don 't know that 's what they 're doing up there . For all they know , they could be taking people somewhere better . And maybe that 's why they haven 't left yet . They 're not going to go until they 've rescued everyone . The reason they haven 't left , Maya , is because they haven 't killed us all yet . Are you going to try and convince yourself that 's Norwegian ? Tell me that doesn 't sound Scandinavian . But you don 't know what they 're saying . It doesn 't matter what they 're saying . What matters is people are there . Well , it could just be a recording put on a loop . Well then , there 'd need to be someone there to keep the power going . If people are there , that 's where we need to head . Yeah , and what about in winter when it 's constant darkness ? Well , then we 'll head South . You haven 't got a clue . They won 't disappear . Can 't just keep running from them . I 'm trying my best in extremely fucking difficult circumstances . Well , I 'm sorry if the circumstances are difficult for you . How do you think it 's been for me with you constantly shutting me out . Sh - , I 'm not shutting you out ! You 're here , aren 't you ? When did you decide to give up on us ? Go , go ! Hey . Can you believe it ? What ? Do you ever listen to the news ? No , what 's going on ? They found Bin Laden yet ? Very funny . They 're saying the asteroid might actually hit us . You 're kidding me . Nope . Washington made an official statement . They 're saying a 20 % chance . What ? I know ! Holy fucking shit . Ugh , I 've got to go . I 'll see you in an hour , right ? Yeah . Love you . Love you too . Where do you want to be when it hits us ? If it hits us . I don 't care , as long as I 'm with you . Do you want to get married ? Yeah , sure . I 'm serious . Well , so am I. We might only have a year left on the planet , so it 's not exactly a lifetime commitment . Yes it is . I 'm asking you to spend the rest of time with me . But what if it doesn 't hit us ? What if it just passes us by ? Then we 'll be stuck together . What , you think I 'm going to dump you just ' cause the world hasn 't ended ? Okay . I will marry you on one condition : There 's no ceremony , no reception , no church . We just agree from here on in that we 're officially married . Agreed . Okay , give me your left hand . If we do this , then it 's real . There 's no turning back . For better or for worse . In sickness and health . You may now kiss the bride . I love you . No matter what . No matter what . Get down . Ugh ! Maybe they were trying to communicate with us . Come on . We 're in a perfectly safe place . It 's daylight ! They 're not going to get us . Just calm down . I won 't calm down ! I haven 't got a fucking clue where we are . You took me off course . Me ? Yes , you keep distracting me ! What ? I told you to stay put , but you wouldn 't listen , would you , and now , as usual , I 'm the one who has to act like a fucking adult and protect us while you piss about . Piss about ? Yes . And I 'd appreciate it if you would take our welfare , that 's mine and your welfare just a little bit more fucking seriously . There 's no food here . It 's all gone . I thought you 'd left this behind .

We were supposed to be in there at quarter to . I was ready . You were the one faffing around . I was trying to find the medical card . The medical card you were supposed to be looking after . Did you lock up properly ? Yes . I 'll see you inside . Do you even need me in there ? He was , of course , a rather controversial figure . That news , once again . Francois Deleruyelle , the amateur astronomer who first discovered the Deleruyelle asteroid cluster two and a half years ago has died at his home in Paris . Initial reports coming in are suggesting that he took his own life , but those reports are not yet confirmed . With just six months to go until the Deleruyelle reaches Earth 's orbit , the world anxiously awaits news from the United States regarding the deliverance vessels and what , if any , success they are likely to have in diverting the objects from the collision course with Earth . We are joined now on the line by Michael Peters , a research scientist out of Southampton University . Uh , Mr. Peters , perhaps you could talk us through your thoughts on the latest information that is surfacing from the United States . Good afternoon , um , I mean , the most interesting thing that I find with this is the sheer lack of any real information coming from Washington . In , in terms of the deliverance mission itself ... The space agency , of course , are trying to put an optimistic spin on things as always , but everyone knows this is a long shot . It 's effectively a last-ditch effort . Certainly our best chance outside of simply keeping our fingers crossed and hoping for the best . You mentioned that the aim is to divert the course of the asteroids , but , uh , what would happen if they were actually broken into pieces ? What effect would that have ? Well , I 'm sorry to say that unless those smaller pieces are also diverted , then it really won 't make much of a difference to us here on Earth . You see , as the situation stands , the main Deleruyelle is fifty miles wide . Even if it broke into fifty smaller pieces , if just one of those pieces hit us , the devastation would be catastrophic . To put it into a bit of perspective , if an asteroid the size of a house hit Earth at this kind of speed , it . Would have a level of energy equivalent to the Hiroshima bomb . That 's about 20 kilotons . Now if the asteroid was just one mile wide , you 're looking at a million megatons . That 's ten million times the amount the obliterated Hiroshima . If it hits land , pretty much everything within a thousand miles would be wiped out . The dust and debris that it would throw up into the atmosphere would block out the sun and most living things on the planet would wither and die . And , you know , if ... It lands in the ocean , well , we 've all seen what happens . Tidal waves hundreds of feet high ... ♪ Was further on down the road ♪ ♪ And give us ... ♪ How is it possible to be this scared of something you haven 't even seen yet ? Say it . For God 's sake , just say it ! Well , do you really think this is a good time to be having a baby ? Of course it 's not a good time to be having a baby . In the history of mankind it 's probably the worst fucking time to be having a baby . What do you want me to do ? We should at least speak about it , shouldn 't we ? What don 't you understand ? The fact that I 'm even pregnant is a miracle . I might not get another chance . Maya . Nobody is having children right now . Nobody . Maya ! Stay there ! Where are you going ? I 'd like to leave now please . Oh no , don 't be hiding in that cupboard , Cole , please . Just get off me Cole , let me go ! We can 't leave now , we can 't leave ... Get off me ! Just , just get off me ! This is all your fucking fault ! My fault ? Yes ! Your fault ! You 're such a coward . I told you wouldn 't have a baby . Why do take so much fucking pleasure in reminding me that . Because of this ! All of this blame and contempt coursing through your veins . It 's all aimed at me ! Well who else is there ? You know what hurts the most ? It 's the fact you don 't even try and fucking hide it ! You think it 's my fault that we haven 't eaten in weeks . Well ... We 're , we 're lost . You think it 's my fault that we 're separated . Oh , I have never said that ! I 've never said that I blame you ! You just fucking said it ! Don 't bullshit me ! I , I didn 't mean that ! Did you or did you not just say it was all my fault , yes or no ? You 're the one who blames yourself . This is not me ! This is all about you ! All I 've tried to do is protect us , and every single word that comes out of your mouth is like a little fucking barbed reminder of the fact you think I failed . Why ? What have I said ? This is all coming from you ! Just admit it . Just admit it . You think I 'm a failure . You always have done ... You never thought I could take care of us ! I never gave a shit that you weren 't on that building site ! Oh , thank you , even though you could 've done anything there it is ! Thank you ! Thank you ! It 's not my fault you were too much of a pussy to do something about it . A pussy ? Yes , a pussy . Yeah . Oh . Wake up , Cole ! Just tell me , what were you so afraid of ? Oh , I don 't fucking know Maya , I don 't know . Maybe it was the fact that we had absolutely no money ! Maybe it was the fact I wasn 't ready to be a father ! Maybe it was the fact there was a fucking giant unidentified object ... Oh ... about to wipe out the entire planet ! God , that 's not what I 'm talking about and you know that . It was never about the Deleruyelle . It was about you . You just used it as an excuse to give up on ... on everything ! That 's fucking bullshit . That is bullshit ! You look at me in the eyes and tell me you think we were ready for a baby . No one 's ever ready , Cole . Bringing a child into that mess was fucking outrageous . It was irresponsible and it was cruel . I 'm sorry , it was . You think I forced you into having a baby ? You told me you couldn 't even have kids . How dare you say that to me . How fucking dare you say that to me you fucking bastard ? Maya , Maya , Maya , Maya . You so much ' . ! Maya , Maya , Maya , Maya . You say that to me ? I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . No ... Just get off me ! Sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I fucking hate you . I know , I know . I hate you so much . I know . I 'm sorry . Hello , Barry Gruberman . Barry , you know we 're having a baby . There 's nothing I can do . Look , we 've not had any new contracts . With everything that 's going on it 's ... Who 's fucking building anything , son ? Is there no one else you can let go first ? I 'm sorry kid . I 've got to prioritize the lads who 've been with me the longest . What about , um ... What about Callum ? Yeah , he 's 19 years old , no responsibilities . He 's been working with me for three years . Fact is , your son 's got nothing to do with it . Look Cole , I don 't have to explain myself . Yes , you do . Barry , I 've worked my ass off for you . Harder than half the lads on that site . Please , don 't do this to me . There 's nothing I can do . Please , Barry . I need this job . There 's got to be something . Sorry , Cole . Barry ? Cheers . How are you doing ? Congratulations . On the baby , I mean . Yeah , thanks . All healthy ? Ten fingers , ten toes ? Yeah . Baby 's fine , as far as we know . The universe ... Gives with one hand , takes away with another . Soon the whole world is going to know what that feels like . Come on , you don 't know that asteroid 's going to hit any more than I do . An asteroid ... is that all you think it is ? It 's not like they want total control over us . I 'm just saying I could be a big help , that 's all . I 'm not taking it . We don 't need charity . Cole , it 's not charity . The pub is busier than it 's ever been . My dad needs more staff . Maya ... They 're offering you work ! Yeah , alright , so it 's bar work , but ... Come on , is that really any worse than working on a building site ? Oh , thanks very much . Anyway , that 's not the point , is it ? I just want to help . They think that if we can get ... No , they think that it 's my fault we 're not even married . I told you , I put her straight on that . Where do they get the right to judge me ? Where is this coming from ? What , what the hell is wrong with you ? They 're offering help . Just grow some balls , suck it up and accept it . You know what , the only reason your old man 's pub didn 't go under two years ago is ' cause of those fucking rocks in the sky . What the hell are you talking about ? Oh , don 't give me that . As soon as people realize we might all get wiped out , all anyone wants to do is go and get fucking pissed . Not everybody . Yes , everybody . People stop giving a shit about money and their cars and their fucking jobs , 'cause you know what ? They realized none of this shit fucking matters . No one gave a flying fuck , including us . Do you remember ? The reason your parents have sat on a pile of money is because everyone else stopped giving the fuck about it . Oh , nice language to use in front of your unborn child . I 'm being serious , Maya . So am I. Maybe when I 'm carrying your baby you could keep the " fucks " to a minimum . Oh , for God 's sake , what are you , my grandmother ? No , I 'm your wife , and I 'd appreciate it ... No , you 're not my wife , are you ? And I 'm not your husband , and we both know why that is , don 't we ? It 's because you had absolutely no fucking desire to marry me whatsoever . Look , the bottom line is that we need the money . We 're going to need to return the pushchair . The pushchair is going nowhere , Maya ? We can 't even afford a proper cot ! I 'm not making the cot because we can 't afford a cot . I 'm making the cot because it 's something I want to do for me . I 'm making it because I want one fucking thing not to be about money . But you 're never going to make it Cole . I have been out of work for two minutes . Two minutes ! Will you just give me a second to get back on my feet ? You 're not a carpenter , Cole . I 'm sorry , but you 're not . Everything you build falls apart . Look at the table and the , the fucking chairs . Do you think I 'm going to let our baby sleep in a cot that you 've made ? You know , sometimes I feel that you 're oblivious to this whole thing . You 're , you 're in denial . I 'm in denial ? You 're ... Oh , what would you want me to do ? Spend all day hiding in the cupboards ? You know what , I can 't do this . I can 't do it . Nothing about this is right . What 're you doing ? What if she 's up there waiting for us ? What 're you talking about , Maya ? Where 's the baby food ? You 're not serious . Come on . I thought we were saving it . Well , There 's no point if we die of starvation before we even get to her . I don 't want it now . Okay , well , I 'll have mine . Maybe we could share one . There 's not enough . It 's supposed to be a joint decision . Don 't give me the look . I wouldn 't touch that . You hear me ? Hello ? Shh , shh . Can 't believe you guys are here . My name 's Keith . Keith NOVAK . Where are you ? Follow the extension cables . You 're heading to Norway ? You 're not ? I don 't buy into all that " land of the midnight sun " stuff . It 's a load of cobblers . Try telling that to this one . Heh , try telling that to my wife . Where is she ? She headed up north with everyone else . She knew I didn 't want to go , so she took her baby girl and left in the middle of the night . Why d 'you have that video playing outside ? It 's a distraction . You don 't have any kids . We do . A girl . She was born just before . A baby girl ? Where is she ? She 's with my parents . When the ships arrived , we were at the hospital . She was with them . We haven 't seen them since . They 're heading north . How do you know ? How do you know that they aren 't ... Because we know . Sorry . Do I know you from somewhere ? No . I don 't think so . You sound familiar . The Prime Minister has called for calm as the world faces up to what he describes as an unprecedented global crisis . Our correspondent Nicholas Adidagee has this report . At approximately 06 : 00 hours eastern standard time , the deliverance nuclear vessels dispatched to the Deleruyelle asteroid were detonated . However , the impact of the explosions was insufficient to divert the asteroid from its course . The deliverance mission has failed . We will continue to monitor the Deleruyelle as it moves closer to Earth over the coming weeks , but I 'm afraid I won 't be taking any questions at the present time . Do you want to feel ? As we 've already heard at came the news we 've all be dreading . - Nah , you 're alright . A statement from Washington confirming that the deliverance mission has failed in its attempt to divert the Deleruyelle from its possible collision course with Earth . Now that 's despite the fact that all 19 of the unmanned nuclear inceptors were successfully detonated , and the news has obviously come as a devastating blow . Only days ago , the US government seemed to have high hopes that the mission could be a success . It seems experts still haven 't gotten to the bottom of what went wrong , and sources have told me that there are lots of heads being scratched in Washington right now . They 're still not sure as to why the operation didn 't work . The response to this has been almost instant , and that response has been civil un ... Hi , this is the voicemail for Maya Garissey . I can 't answer the phone right now but leave me a message and I 'll call you back . Maya . You can 't just pack your stuff up and leave in the middle of the night , okay ? Now , give me a call back . I came down to the hospital today , to the appointment , hoping that you 'd be here . Where are you ? You can 't just keep avoiding me , alright ? We obviously need to talk about this . Just , just give me a call back , please . Why did you want to die ? What ? That night . You wanted him to shoot you . What 're you talking about ? Didn 't you have anyone you cared about ? Hang on , you think I actually wanted him to kill me ? You were daring him to put a bullet in your head . I was standing up to him . He was scared . He was never going to pull the trigger . And you 're sure about that ? He only shot you because you attacked him . Right . I see . I 've , I 've got to go . You know , I had what you had . Someone who cared about me . Look , mate , you don 't need to convince me you 've been dealt a shitty hand , alright . Her name was Aurora . I know , right ? When I first met her , she couldn 't speak any English . And she was only here on holiday . I saw her walking along Saint Cyrus beach . It was the middle of January . She had this hair , this crazy blonde hair blowing all over the place . We were literally the only two people for miles around . She was walking one way , and I was walking the other . Well , I knew we were going to pass each other . As she got closer , I was desperately trying to think of something to say . Anything . Before I knew it , we were crossing paths . We made eye contact for a split second . I balled up . Then we just passed each other like ships in the night . I carried on walking . I knew I 'd just saddled myself with a lifetime regret , wondering what may have happened if I 'd just had the nerve to speak to her . And just as I was wishing the sand to swallow me whole , I heard her voice from behind me ask if I had a lighter . Her English was terrible , but she knew how to say that . So windy . Took us forever to light that fucking thing . By the time it did ... I was in love . We spent the rest of that day together , and the day after that , and somehow I kept managing to convince to extend her holiday , until eventually she just ... She loved me back . And for the first time in my life , the rest of the world didn 't exist anymore . But then I end up in here , and the " me " that she fell in love with didn 't exist anymore . And she did everything she could to try and find him again , but she couldn 't . He was gone . And I was all that was left . And then I pushed her and I pushed her and I pushed her . Until eventually , when she couldn 't ... When she couldn 't take any more , she got on a plane and she went home . And all I got was a postcard telling me how sorry she was . Tell me . Why should she be sorry ? What is all this stuff ? That 's for communications . Communications ? Is that your field ? Afraid not . I 'm actually a doctor . You 've contacted other survivors ? No , no , no , no , no . Well , communications with who ? With them . You 've had contact with the ships . Kind of . Listen to this . It 's coming from them . Well , what is it ? I don 't know . I 've been trying to send a signal back . Well how do you know that 's even going to work ? I don 't , but we 've got to try , right ? I mean , we 're so busy running away from them that ... We 've missed the point . Like it or not , our life is in their hands . What signal did you send them ? Just basic morse code . Morse code ? You may as well a Shakespearian sonnet . They know a lot more about us than you realize . Here , look at this . Here , look . C27 , what is that ? It 's on one of the ships . I was trying to make contact . If they had been observing us , learning everything about us for years , they 'll have worked out that we stopped caring a long time ago . This world is like a piece of fruit . An orange , decaying from the inside out , and we 're like hundreds of ants , crawling all over , bleeding it dry . So they 've gotten rid of all the other ants , so that we have a chance of surviving . What the hell are you talking about ? All those things want to do is kill us . You don 't know that . That 's where you 've gone wrong . Look around . Things have changed . This isn 't the same world anymore . But you 're still trying to apply the same logic to it . They 've wiped everything out . But we 're still here . Why ? Why ? Because we 're lucky . Come on ! There 's got to be a reason they haven 't killed us . Oh , they 've tried . Believe me . Have they ? You 've been on your own too long . Me ? Or you ? Have you ever seen one of them ? Of course . Haven 't you ? We 've been hiding . What do they look like ? There 's a pile of photographs over there . You can keep one if you like . Help persuade the nonbelievers . Convince the doubters . Clear up the inevitable confusion later on . They didn 't go to Norway . Hey ! I 've got money ! Money ? What use is that ? Please , let her go . Please don 't hurt my wife . Whatever happens to her , that 's not my responsibility . I 'll fucking kill you ! Shh . They can hear us . They can always hear us . Ants and oranges , Cole . Ants and oranges . Ladies and gentlemen , I am very sorry to bring you the news that the final attempt to divert the Deleruyelle has failed . If nothing changes , then , we 'll all be hit within the next couple of hours . We 'll be playing your requests as long as we possibly can . Good luck everyone . Welcome to voicemail 1571 . The person you are calling is not available . Please leave a message after the tone . Hi , it 's me . Do you remember the night we first met ? We talked about how we 'd feel if we knew the Deleruyelle was going to hit us . I said that nothing would matter and you convinced me that everything would . What changed ? I 'm sorry I left . It 's not what I wanted , Cole . But even if the world doesn 't end , I don 't want to spend the rest of my life with some who wishes that ... Ahh ... Ahh ! Hey ! Hello ? Hey ! Hey ! They 've blocked the ... We 're not letting anyone else in ! My name 's Cole Narroway . My wife 's having a baby . I 'm sorry , we can 't help . Please , wait , wait , wait , no no ! She 's already here , she 's in the hospital . You just need to let me in . Okay ... Go in the car park . There 's an entrance down there . I 'll come out and meet you . Jesus , shouldn 't you be inside ? Inside , outside , what 's the difference ? Whoa , what , what , what are you doing ? Hey ! You keep quiet ! They might hear you ! What do you want ? I want my life back . Three years ago , you took it from me and I want it back . Michael , I didn 't take your life . It was him . You know it was him . It wasn 't him ! Yes it was , and the fact that he 's walking around breathing the same air as you is a cruel fucking travesty . It is , but it 's not my fault . He would 've just walked out of there if you 'd just kept your mouth shut ! You had that gun pointed in your face you and you still left that night with a second chance . And what have you done with it ? Nothing ! You don 't know anything about me . I know a waste of fucking life when I see one . And I know when it comes to that thing in the sky that me and you are exactly the same . You want it to wipe out the entire planet just as much as I do . But I have nothing and I have no one ! And what 's your excuse ? Alright , Michael . Please , please , alright , look . Whatever you think , alright , and whatever happened , I didn 't plan it , okay ? I didn 't think ... You don 't think ! You 're for yourself and no one else . You 're a coward . You wanted him to shoot you . Alright , alright , you 're right . I 'm a coward , I admit I 'm a coward , but I need to find my wife . I want to be with my wife and child . They need me . They don 't need you . What do they need you for ? Look around . It 's too late . The Deleruyelle is here . They 're finished like everyone else . You don 't know that . Your wife and your baby might as well lock themselves in the cupboards and hope for the best . Just let me try . It 's too late . Please . Please , just let me try . Just give me a chance to be a father . M-Maya ? Shh . You 've lost her Cole . You had everything . You had her , but you 've lost her , and now it 's time to accept that . Shh . Just let it go . All that blame , contempt coursing through your veins . Just let it go . Shh . Tell me , what are you so afraid of ? Maybe it was the fact you had absolutely no money . Maybe it was the fact that you weren 't ready to be a father . Maybe it was the fact there was a fucking giant unidentified object about to wipe out the entire planet . It was never about the Deleruyelle . It was about you . You just used it as an excuse to give up on ... On everything . This planet had its chance , Cole . Just like you have had this chance and you blew it . You see , this world is like a piece of fruit . An orange , decaying from the inside out , and we 're like hundreds of ants crawling all over it , bleeding it dry . Ants and oranges , Cole . Ants and oranges . Move towards the light . And stay in the light . Move towards the light . Stay in the light . Where you go from here , Cole ... That 's up to you . But this , this is where I need to be . That 's where she is . That 's where she is . I know it . Wake up , Cole ! Cole . Cole ! Can you hear me ? Cole ! My name 's Keith NOVAK . Try and stay with me . This is Dr. NOVAK , I need assistance . C27 , what is that ? It 's on one of the ships . I was trying to make contact . You 've had contact with the ships . No , listen to this . It 's coming from them . I 've been trying to send them a signal back . ♪ I was heading South , kicking through the leaves ♪ ♪ And last weekend was when the clocks went back ♪ Two men down . Is anyone there ? Cole ! Is anyone here ? Pick up ! Cole ! Cole are you there ? Cole ? Can you hear me ? Cole , she 's here . We 've got a baby girl , you should see her . She 's amazing . Cole ? Where are you ? Have you heard what they 're saying ? They 're saying the Deleruyelle 's breaking apart . We 're going to be okay , Cole . We 're going to be okay .

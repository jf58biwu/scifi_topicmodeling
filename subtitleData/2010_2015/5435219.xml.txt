Weren 't you in the briefing ? I thought " Chinese hot spot " meant we were getting take-out . Last night , this was a thriving village . Now it 's gone . At least the people got out in time . Okay , this is strange . All traces of metal iron , copper , zinc are gone , completely extracted . What could do this ? Tornado ? Magnetic tornado ? This was an attack . On an unarmed village in the Gobi desert ? It doesn 't add up . A complex organic chemical , oxidized . It must break down quickly . Distress call . South of here . Another village . We 're over the town now . Make that half a town . Aah ! Uh , what was that ? They 're eating the metal and leaving everything else behind , even the stone . Amazing . It 's like an organic processing plant . Rex . Bobo . With me . You 're going down there ? I 'm all for physical force when necessary , but I recommend ... It 'll be fine . We 're professionals . Next floor ... lingerie , cookware , and giant mutant grasshoppers . Ding . It looks like the evacuation was successful . Weapons ready . Bugs . I hate bugs . I 'm gonna cure one so we can ask them what happened . Negative . Rudimentary brain function only . These insects were never people . You say it like it 's a bad thing . Whoa ! I thought those blades could slice through anything . You didn 't ask , but scans say their shells are an enhanced alloy , hyperatomic bonds . Noted . Rex : I make metal . They eat metal . Should we have put this together sooner ? And now you 're spitting on me . Rex , careful ! That ichor it 's a pheromone tag . Whatever you do , don 't get sprayed . Anyone got a swatter ? Fall back ! I 've been run out of town before , but not like this ! Whoa ! Excellent timing , Dr. Holiday . I 'm not here for you . But if you 're through fighting what you don 't understand , you 're welcome to hitch a ride . Where 'd they go ? Not that I 'm sorry to see them leave . Rendezvous with the keep . Still got more than you . That 's what you 'll be telling the guys in the motor pool . I got 45 , man ! 46 ! Whoa ! Ha ! One of mine ! That puts me at 47 , ahead by 2 , baby . You have six hands between the both of you . You think you could lend one ? Rex : It looks like a cricket on steroids . If you find any of me in there , I want it back . It 's likely an evo fusion of locusts , termites , and beetles . I 've located the swarm in the wilderness of inner Mongolia . They 've congregated 200 kilometers south . They 're traveling in a straight line . There 's more . They 're attracted by the city 's high metal content . 100 million tons of steel . 15 million people . Report . The swarm has congregated underground . Based on the low heat signature , they 've entered a dormant phase , likely to process their lunch . I 'll need reinforcements from our international divisions . As a fallback only . I 've been given authorization for a more ... Direct approach . Bleach protocol . We have a last-stand device primed and ready . You can 't be serious ! They 're in an unpopulated area , doctor . And if that changes ? Make sure it doesn 't . We activate in one hour . It 's like using pesticides . You may kill a few ants , but later generations come back even stronger . I have science to back me up on this . I don 't know , doc . Sometimes you got to say , " nuke ' em . " Forced-plasma cascade . Try working that into a catchphrase . A better way is to use the creature 's biological responses against it . - You mean the sticky hormone ? - Pheromone . I just need a sample . The creatures seem to use it to tag objects of high metal content . Get ' em from your stinky friend . It breaks down too quickly . It has to be extracted from a living specimen . I just need someone to go into the nest and ... Rex : There 's your biological response right there . Ugh . I 'm such a wuss . In position , doc . I made it from non-metallic polymer conductants - like the comlink and the ... - Rope ? Kinda low-tech . You can 't build out , Rex . Any metal could trigger the bugs ' reflexive response . But I 'm full of little metal machines ! Your nanites are too small , too dispersed . They won 't detect them ... I think . Into the nest with no powers . Thanks for saving that for last , doc . Aah ! No powers . Remember , no powers . Rex , what do you see ? They 're ... I don 't know , dividing , splitting in two . Mitosis . That 's why they 've been collecting the metals , to generate duplicates ! Hmm . Huh ? Hmm . Nah . Ugh ! Dis ... Gus ... Ting ! Huh ? Rex ? Small problem , doc . I think I smell like lunch . Vámonos ! Aaaah ! Got to stay under . Not sure I can ... Make it . Rex , you 're all right . What ... What happened ? We pulled you from the river . It 's a miracle you 're still alive . No one should have survived that long . My life flashed before me , doc , in high-def . Um , I 'm sorry I didn 't get your sample . I 'm sorry , too . Holiday to Six . He 's awake . I 'll be there shortly . We 're in countdown to detonation . Dr. Holiday : " Just nuke ' em , " right ? There 's no way to fight these things , doc . I got to get up there . Huh ? Uh ... Where 's my clothes ? Sorry . I had to quarantine them . There 's a chance I can still salvage some of the pheromone compound they sprayed on you . Wait . You mean , you saw me ... Dr. Holiday : Oh , please . I 'm a doctor . Motorcycles , huh ? Ohhhh . Welcome back from the light . Nice bathrobe . Evacuation of the area is complete , and the secretary confirms authorization to strike . Commencing countdown . Initiating bleach protocol in t-minus 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Initiate . Wait . They 're multiplying , sir , exponentially . On the move again . Original course . I 'm gonna go out on a limb here . I think we made it worse . It seems we 'll have to implement the fallback plan . Dr. Holiday : So , blindly charging forward didn 't work ? I 'm shocked . Doctor , we could use your help . Now you want to listen to me ? ! I 've got work to do . I want troops on the ground . We 'll pick them off one by one . Gentlemen , say hello to the broiler . Your broiler is your friend . Learn the broiler . Love the broiler . Focused microwave inducer . Do not put your tongue on it . This ? Decorative . But it completes the whole bug-sprayer motif , don 't you think ? Captain Calan , welcome to the fight . Wouldn 't miss it . This thing was built to hold off Mongols on horseback , not that . Um , Six ? Now would be a good time to , you know , rally the troops , get everyone pumped up for the fight . Command to all points , keep those things off the wall . Six out . Well , I 'm pumped . Here they come . Aaah ! Another outbreak in sector 8 . 728 . 729 . 833 . We lost post 7 . And 8 . And 3 . We 're getting eaten alive ! In my case , not a figure of speech ! All troops , begin evacuation ! Fall back ! 1,012 . Go ! 1,013 . You go ! 1,0 ... Fall back ! Now ! Six to white knight . Defenses have failed . Rex : Send the majority of the regiment to assist in the evacuation effort , the keep , too . You know , considering we just got kicked off the largest manmade structure ever built and those things keep trying to eat me , I 'm feeling pretty good about our chances . Glad someone is . Huh ? Doc ! Came to wish us luck ? No . I came to give you this . It 's the pheromone . And you can have these back . Found traces behind the nylon tag . It 's my backup pair , all right ? ! This going to be enough ? It 's extremely concentrated . But just in case ... That 's a lot of goo . Doctor , good to see you . Yes . It is . We have a plan to lure the creatures back into the desert . The swarm covers half the province . Even our fastest jet couldn 't fly around . Then we go over . Rex , load up ! Me ? ! Put it in a missile or something ! This substance is proximity-based . I need your accuracy . Hop on . Any last-minute instructions ? Try not to die this time . Bravo squadron , you 're up . Shoot anything that moves . Rex : Doc , punch out ! Noooo ! Ugh . That is totally messed up . Doc ! Wake up ! I accidentally fired the gunk . Now they 're eating each other ! Of course . This " gunk " is a hundred times more potent than what 's in them . We 're hijacking their biology and using it against them ! I want sprayers in here . Modify the bombers , as well . It 's working . That 's one more for me . Yeah , well , I got the rest of them . A massive section of the great wall was felled tragically yesterday . But as the world mourns , it also celebrates the millions of lives saved in Asia , lives saved in large part to something you might find hard to believe ... Wait for it ... These colorful undies . Our sources say they gave Providence scientists the scent they needed to turn those bugs against themselves . Why is my underwear on TV ? Sources ? This wouldn 't have anything to do with the fact that I stomped more bugs than you , would it ? Heh . What do you think ? I think I 'm going back to bed now . Vroom , vroom .

Gary , I called the cellular company and told them to shut it down , okay ? Yeah , they did shut it down , but then they turned it back on . Bill . You need to shoot it . I 'm not shooting anything , okay ? - Look , I 'll call them again . - No , Bill . No more talking . It 's time for action . Give me the gun . I 'll shoot it . Gary , I 'm not giving you my gun . Yeah , give me- - no , you 're right . - Give me a grenade . - Gary , out . Bill , give me a grenade . Gary , good-bye . You don 't even have a grenade . Bye , Bill . [ Laughs ] Nina , I need you to help me push someone . Sorry , Gary . I can 't do that . No , but Dr. Rosen says that we 're a team , and we have to help each other . I am helping you , Gary . I 'm keeping you out of trouble . Look , I just want to spend more time with him . Well , maybe I can pick him up from school a few days a week , huh ? Well , then drop him off . Oh , let me guess . Chamomile , right , and lavender . What else ? A touch of angelica oil , some Jasmine , and a little bit of sandalwood . Oh . Didn 't go so well ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Well , these are all aromas that help relieve stress , so I 'm guessing your meeting with the young man that your parents chose didn 't go all that swimmingly . And I 'm guessing that Nina told you . Yes , Nina told me . But I want to remind you , Rachel , of all the good work we 've been doing , you know , towards your assertiveness and confidence , so , if you ever need to tell your parents no ... And I 'd like to remind you , Dr. Rosen , that we 've been working on my assertiveness , but I still have a long way to go , Dr. Rosen . Mm . You just interrupted me . I 'm so sorry . - I didn 't mean to be rude . - Rachel , don 't be . It 's exactly what I 'm talking about . Progress . Hmm . Busy morning . No , look , we don 't have to go through the courts if you would just agree ... Yeah , fine , stick to the schedule . [ Slams receiver ] Divorce is a tricky thing , isn 't it ? Especially when there 's a child involved . My therapy session isn 't till tomorrow , Doc . As someone who 's been through it , understand that it 's never a simple equation . But no matter what happens , Tyler will always be your son . You should write that up . Publish a self-help book . [ Glass shatters ] Hicks broke another one . That 's three . It 's fascinating what happens when you let stress get to you . Yeah , my abilities don 't work so well . But you have made significant strides , Mr. Hicks , whether you realize it or not . And that 's something that you should- - [ cell phone rings ] Excuse me . Sorry . Rosen . Doc , we have a situation . Hope you got your Metro card . Some of the witnesses , they say Officer Laurinzano started this mess , but I don 't see it . Bobby was on the job 15 years , just marking time till his pension . The last thing he wanted was trouble . Wait a minute . Exactly who are you people ? Thanks for your help , officer . You can go now . You didn 't push him too severely , did you ? I don 't like when they start asking questions back . You know you could have waited on me , right ? - My badge still works . - Where 's Gary ? Pending your disciplinary review . He 's over there . There 's no way in hell they 're gonna let me go because of one bad day on the job , okay ? Besides , my badge still has its own magic . Anyway , Doc , I talked to the transit cops . They say all the riders are completely confused . Everyone apparently just lost it . One minute , everything 's copacetic . The next thing they know , kicking , biting , screaming . Well , Wilson was right . This is right up our alley . Gary , Gary , do you have anything ? No , it 's chatter . Chatter , chatter . Lieutenant Bixby wants his wife to pick up $ 50 of lottery tickets . My mom won 't let me ride the subway , though . She says it 's too stressful . There 's too much stimulation . I don 't believe this . Yeah , no , she says it 's crowded and it 's smelly , and she 's right . Nobody 's talking about your mama , Gary . Hey , excuse me . He 's with me . Let him through , please . FBI . Let him through . Thank you . Hicks , you have got to be kidding me . - What ? - You leave a crime scene to go get a cup of coffee ? You know , I 'd have brought you a doughnut , but they ran out . You think that 's funny ? This ain 't the damn movies . Let me tell you something , Hicks . Learn to follow instructions . - You were a Marine , weren 't you ? - Yeah . And now you know why I 'm a civilian . Well , Agent Wilson decides to show up . That 's your department of defense for you . Four unexplained riots in the past two months . 1 dead , 13 injured in Cleveland , 15 hurt in Pittsburgh , 3 fatalities in Philadelphia , and now this . That 's 29 people in the hospital and 5 in the morgue . NSA says this isn 't one of their usual suspects . Doesn 't look natural . So does this look like an Alpha or not ? Don , I only just got here myself . All I can tell you so far is that Alpha involvement is a possibility . Lee , you sold us on your group for exactly this sort of situation . If it is an Alpha causing these riots , you need to find him for us , preferably before the local cops , CNN , or some damn blogger opens up a can of worms . Well , exposure is the last thing any of us want . Then deliver . Wilson , always a pleasure . You need anything ? We 're fine , Nina . Thank you . Don , one more thing . While you 're here , could you flash your credentials ? I 'd like to get a hold of the train surveillance footage . Harken 's FBI badge only goes so far , but the words " Homeland Security , " they work wonders these days . I 'll see what I can do . [ Laughs ] I forgot how much the subway smelled like human waste . Thank God for government limos . Thank you , Don . [ Muffled voices beneath static sound ] [ Woman 's voice echoes distantly ] So I was able to get witness statements from the previous incidents . Same exact pattern . Anger , violence , for no good reason . Followed by sadness and confusion . When I push people , they come out of it pretty confused . That 's because they 're not in control of their actions . And I don 't think that crowd was in control either . So what you 're saying is that it was an Alpha like Nina that pushed the crowd . Not exactly . Nina can 't push a whole crowd . Someone else is at play . It 's ready . Pheromones . That 's what 's causing these ants to be so aggressive . Normally , the brain controls the release of pheromones , but our Alpha can supercede brain function and fire them off at will . And I think that 's exactly what Rachel detected in the subway . Yeah , and especially on the monkey . That 's where the scent was the strongest . It 's all about the monkey . The monkey was ground zero . Do not open this bag , Gary . That 's evidence . In the case of these ants , the scent triggered a defense mechanism when the hive was threatened by the scorpion . Well , whoever did this must feel threatened a lot . Four times in the past few months . We 've got to stop this . Why us ? Besides Harken here , none of us has any real training for this type of thing . I spent four years at Langley . Well , translating Farsi . But still , it 's- - You know , I understand what you 're saying , Mr. Hicks . It would be a lot easier to leave this in the hands of traditional law enforcement . Only New York 's finest aren 't exactly trained to handle Alphas . Whereas the five of you have some very special gifts which make you as surprising and as unexpected as the person we 're looking for . If we can 't solve this , who can ? Hurrah . It 's--it 's streaming . Wilson got the surveillance footage , and it 's streaming . - It 's humming again . - What hum , Gary ? - It 's a Gary thing . - It 's not a Gary thing ! There 's a hum across the street . It 's unbearable . - There 's no hum- - - There 's a hum . Fix it . We 'll look into it , Gary . I 've expressed myself . There- - there wasn 't a hum . - ♪ Hmmmmm-mmmm ♪ That 's not funny . All right , so Rosen likes to make speeches . But it doesn 't mean what he has to say isn 't important . Listen , Rosen wants you on his team because he thinks he can help you . And he probably can . He helped me . I know it 's hard to believe . But when I met Rosen ... I was a mess . Plus , your hyperkinesis , it comes in handy . So me being on the team , it 's , uh , win-win , huh ? Doesn 't matter what I think . It matters what you think . Come on , Tony , you promised me seats right behind the dugout . Don 't go changing your mind on me now . [ Knocking ] Bill--Bill , please . The surveillance footage , I think I found something . Okay , I 'll call you right back . All right , it is right about ... Here . What exactly am I looking at ? Right here , look . - The monkey . - That 's our ground zero . The monkey had the strongest pheromone scent of anything in the subway car , so it had to have been right next to the Alpha when the riot started . While hanging off the girl 's backpack ? Best guess , she 's our Alpha . We need to find that girl before she kills anybody else . So yeah , her name is Tracy Beaumont . She 's 17 years old . Rachel found surveillance footage of her entering the train on 47th Street . She was taken to Saint Boniface Hospital . She was treated for cuts and bruises . Released , but then she skipped out before the cops could interview her . Well , we now have a name and a face . It 's a start , right ? That is assuming she gave her real name . Well , that 's an astute observation , Mr. Hicks . Well , apparently I 'm an investigator now . - Well , I 'll start here . - Mm-hmm . If Tracy is her real name , I should be able to dig something up . Gary , you gonna monitor the ATM and street cameras from here ? - No , I can 't--no . - Yeah , Gary , that 's what- - I can 't do that from here , Bill , it 's too much humming . Gary , that 's part of the job . - You have to use your gun . - No , there will be no guns being used on anything , Gary . Yeah . Gary , have you seen what time it is ? Yes , I have to be in bed at 9 : 30 . You 're killing me . - Y-yes , I 'm sorry . He can look for Tracy at home just as well . Mr. Hicks , Nina , Rachel and I will- - - You 're on stand-by . - On stand-by , fine . So this is , like , a real job , I mean ... I 'm on call ? People are being killed , Mr. Hicks , and we have to find out how . If it 's any consolation , you now have an excellent health plan . [ Chuckles ] His family is very well established . But you can 't appear desperate , despite your condition . Mom , I 'm better now . Dr. Rosen 's really helped . A lot more reason to meet a man while you 're healthy . You make it sound like I have some sort of a disease . Like I 'm gonna get sick again . I 'm fine , mom . We worry . That 's what parents do . But I 'm fine , mom . Besides , you don 't want to stay single your whole life . [ Cell phone rings ] Yes , Gary . I 've found her . Tracy Beaumont , the girl with the monkey . She 's at 34th , walking north on Sixth . That 's a very good street to walk on--it 's very well lit . Excellent work . Just keep an eye on her , please . She 's turning onto Broadway , northwest . Broadway goes northwest . Yes , I know . Keep your phone on . Now , listen , we 've identified a suspect . Yes , I 'll let you know as soon as we have her . Don , yeah--yes , it 's a her . Don , we 're on location now . I 'm gonna have to get back to you ... Gary said she should be around here somewhere . I can smell traces of the pheromone in the air . Can you track the source ? It 's the alley . What is it , Rachel ? [ Exhales ] - What is it ? - I lost it . - What ? - I lost it--I can 't . - Focus . - [ Whimpers ] All right , listen , listen . You guys fan out , okay ? Up this way- - if you see anything , you know what to do , right ? Give me a call . - We only want the- eyes only . - Eyes only . Hicks , with me , come on . Nina . [ Cell phone rings ] Dr. Rosen , I am asleep . Uh , I know it 's way past your bedtime , I 'm sorry . But Gary , I need you to ping our location and then check the area . She 's somewhere near us . Uh , okay--okay , you have to go through the parking lot . Yeah . And now turn right . Heart right ? I mean left , left . That 's right , Gary , left , thank you . Okay , which way now , Gary ? Uh , well , we 're at the corner of 52nd and Eighth . Dr. Rosen ... She 's there . She 's this way . She 's going into that youth hostel . Bill , four blocks north of the van . Okay , right there . Come on , let 's go ! Come on ! [ Screaming and yelling ] She went in there ? That 's not good . We have to get her out . I 'm not sure I can push them all . Don 't go anywhere near them . They 're covered in pheromones . That 's her . That 's the girl--Tracy ! Tracy Beaumont ! [ Tires screeching ] [ Cars honking ] I got her ! I got her ! [ Horns honking ] [ Calling out ] Hey ! Hey , don 't run from me ! What are you doing ? Get back here ! I only want to talk ! Young man , do you know that girl ? He was in the subway , Dr. Rosen . You were in the subway . No , no , no , no . No ! No ! Hicks ! Hicks ! Stop him ! What did I do ? I didn 't do anything wrong ! Why are you running , huh ? Why are you running ? - Get off of me ! - Relax ! [ Police sirens ] [ Tires screeching ] You were there in the subway . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't know anything . Young man ... Your friend back there , Tracy Beaumont , she 's in a lot of trouble . We 're trying to find her to help her before anyone else gets hurt . Dr. Rosen , he has the scent all over him . He must have been right next to her when it went off . You know about that ? The thing that my sister does that makes everyone angry ? Yes , yes , we do . It doesn 't work on me . I 'm immune . Gary , tell me you know where she is . - She got into a cab . - Which one ? Bill , it was yellow . - She 's--she 's your sister . - Yes . I 've been looking for her for months . I 'm the only one that can stop her . 'Cause Dr. Rosen wanted me to come in- - Yeah , well , we 're on call . That 's part of the job . No , that 's not what my mom said . She said we--she used words that I can 't use , but- - and then she drove me here . The thing is Gary , there 's a dangerous Alpha out there and- - - Yeah . - We have to deal with it . Yeah , I know , 'cause we 're important . But I should be sleeping now , and there 's still a hum . So I 'm upset , and I 'm complaining . I just complained . You sure did . Well , he says she 's his sister--yes , Don . Don , of course we 're checking . No , if you people come stomping in here , we might lose any chance of him cooperating . Just let me speak with him . I 'm sure I can convince him to lead us to her . Don--unh . He hung up . I 'll take that as consent . Do you want me to go in there with you ? I hope that won 't be necessary . You can take a seat if you like . No , I don 't wanna sit on my ass . When can I get outta here ? Believe me , we don 't want to keep you any longer than we have to . But people are dying , son , and it 's essential that you help us find your sister . I don 't even know who you guys are ! I haven 't seen a badge or anything . How do I even know you 're cops ? Well , we 're not cops . We 're trained specialists in cases like your sister 's . And I don 't think you want the cops to find her before we do . Okay , so , um , what are you- - what are you guys gonna do to her ? Please , sit down . We 're going to do everything we can to keep your sister from hurting herself or anyone else for that matter . Now , I 'm going to record our conversation . It 's only for the purposes of myself and my team . Okay , what do you wanna know so that I can get out of here and find her ? We can start with your name . Uh , Matthew . Matthew Hurley . Yeah , this is Special Agent Bill Harken . I need a background check . Hurley--but your sister 's last name is Beaumont . Beaumont is our mother 's maiden name . Or at least it , um ... It was . Uh , she 's--she 's dead now . Our father ... beat her to death three years ago . And you are concerned that Tracy caused that ? Alice . It 's Alice . She must have changed her name to hide from everything that happened back home . And where is home ? Arden , Ohio . Harken , you hearing this ? Hey , Hicks , this is what I do for a living , okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm here . Yes , I will hold . It 's only a multiple murder case . Matthew , you said your father caused your mother 's death . But when I asked you if you thought that Tracy had- - uh , Alice , had anything to do with it , you avoided the question . Do you think she had anything to do with it ? Look , Alice is a good person . My sister--sometimes it all gets away from her . So it all got away from her on the subway ? It was that stupid cop . He shows up , and then she panicked . You know , I just- - I don 't know , sometimes she just gets really scared . And I am the only one that can keep her under control . Arden , Ohio . The town website is down . Okay , thanks Gary . But just keep looking , okay ? Yeah , Rachel , this is what I do for a living . It 's what I do for a living . Okay--okay , Gary . No . This stupid humming . Please , it 's the microwave tower across the street . Fix it , please . So you 're saying that she 's some kind of a freak ? No . Absolutely not . I am not saying that . I 'm saying that she has a medical condition ... Which I can help her with . And you may be the key . Because , as you said , her ability- - it does not affect you . Why- - why doesn 't it affect me ? Because I believe your brain produces enough serotonin to counterbalance your sister 's influence , which is a result of your longtime , well , low-level exposure to her . So you really ... Think you can help her ? We can end this . But ... Only if we can find her , Matthew . This is a waste of time . Why doesn 't Rosen just have you go in there and push this kid ? My ability only lasts for a few minutes . Besides , Rosen doesn 't like to work that way . I mean , his heartbeat is regular , he sounds sincere . So speaks the human lie detector . Agent Wilson . Your security is pathetic . Well ... Bill , Agent Wilson 's here . Where 's Rosen ? How the hell did you get in here ? Oh , you 're good . I miss Agent Sullivan . She was nicer . I 'll be right back , Matthew . Don , hey , I asked you for more time . And I hung up on you , Lee , 'cause it 's your job to keep me happy . We 're making progress . He 's beginning to trust me . My trust is what 's important here . Your entire operation hangs on my good nature . Now , what do you got for me ? Well , quite a lot , actually . And if you just let me finish what I started here , I think I can win his complete cooperation . What I need is his sister in Binghamton yesterday . Before she can add to her body count . What 's Binghamton ? Um , it 's a place where your sister can get some help . Doesn 't sound like that . It sounds like a prison . No . - You 're gonna lock her away . - Matthew- - No one 's gonna pin a medal to her chest for what she 's done . I found her . I found her , I found your sister . Someone using the name Tracy Beaumont just bought a bus ticket to Chicago . She got an email confirmation . It leaves from downtown Yonkers at 6 : 00 am . It--it 's buzzing . Score one for Rain Man . Rain--that 's a movie . I 'm not allowed to watch that . Gary--okay , okay . We won 't be needing you anymore . You have to take me with you . I can stop her if you take me with you . - Calm down . - You 'll get hurt . What does that mean ? I 'm gonna get hurt- - I need to stop her . We need to slow down a minute , please . - Look , I got this , I got this ! - I can stop her . - Doc , doc . - Like you knew this before ? Mom , why are you still awake ? It 's not even light out . No , I 'm awake because of my job . - That 's Matthew 's sister . - What ? This is Matthew 's sister ? That is not the girl on the subway . - Then he 's lying . - Exactly . - I 'm going with you ! - I-I found her . That 's what I do for a living . Gary . Gary . - Yeah . - Don . Look- - Don , please would you- - No , no , no , you can 't do this . You can 't do this ! Whoa , there . - Don 't touch him ! - You can 't do this ! No ! Aaaah ! [ Fluid gurgling , whooshing ] [ Sustained groaning ] Aaaarrrghh ! [ Garbled , indistinct voices ] [ Yelling in Farsi ] Aah ! I hate it ! [ Screaming , yelling ] [ Screaming , yelling ] I don 't want to live with you anymore ! [ Screaming , yelling ] [ Yelling in Farsi ] Rachel ! Rachel ! [ Screams ] [ Yelling , screaming ] Stop ! Gary ! Freeze ! Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Aarrgh ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Aaarrghh ! [ Groaning , whimpering ] What 's happening ? I got angry . It 's all right , Gary . We all did . - Where 's Matthew ? - I don 't know . Unh ! [ Distant whimpering ] [ Crying ] I don 't know why I did it . I don 't know why ... He 's dead . Copy that . Containment crew inbound . Eta , 16 minutes . [ Conversation not audible ] You ready ? Almost . Don Wilson was not an easy guy , but he did not deserve to die like that . Doc , do you have any idea why that kid 's ability didn 't work on me ? I mean , everybody else was going crazy , and I felt fine . Exactly . Exactly what ? Why did they put the sheet on Agent Wilson ? It just--it got all bloody , and it was red . I can still smell the blood . I never knew what it felt like . To be forced to do something against your will like that . I mean , when I push people- - No , it 's not the same . All right , um- - Dr. Rosen , I 'm sorry . I need to go home . Of course , I understand . Go . You gotta get your nose looked after . It can wait . Nina , will you take Gary home , please ? - You sure ? - Yes . Uh , Mr. Hicks , we need to find Matthew before Wilson 's people do . Bill can control his own fight or flight reflexes . I think I have a way to control yours . Serotonin . Sit down , please . Yeah . Tracy . Why did you run ? - Matthew . - Hi . What are you doing here ? Why are you here ? We 're going to Chicago , right ? Let 's buy me a ticket . No . Matthew , no . That 's not a good idea , okay ? - We can 't stay here . - Shh , I know . We always said we would get out of arden together . That was before everything happened , okay ? You think I hurt all those people for no reason ? It was because of you- - for you , for us . Calm down , please . You 're the only one that doesn 't get crazy around me . - We 're supposed to be together . - I can 't . All the fights at school and what happened to your sister . - No , Tracy , that was not me . - And now these riots . Matthew , people died . Okay ? You killed them . No , I haven 't killed anybody . Tracy , listen to me . Listen , I didn 't run away from Arden . I ran away from you . Tracy- - Matthew ! Let her go--let her go . Everybody back up , FBI ! - Come on , move , move , move ! - FBI ! Out of the building , now ! - Stay away ! - Calm down . I will start a riot , and I won 't stop until a lot of people are dead . Listen to me , don 't make it any worse than it already is- - get out of the building now ! Matthew , please ! Do as they say , please ! Matthew , listen to your friend . Don 't you see you 're making me do this ? No , Matthew , you control it , okay ? Don 't do this . - You make it happen . - Don 't do it . - I 'm doing this for you . - No . I 'm doing this for you . No , I don 't want you to do this . Matthew , stop ! [ Screaming , yelling ] No ! No ! No ! Get off of me ! [ Screams ] Go , Harken , go ! I can get her ! [ Running footsteps ] [ Screaming , yelling ] No ! Unh ! Tracy ! [ Screams ] Come on , come on ! Hey , close your eyes . What ? Unh ! Aah ! How did we get up here ? Watch out , watch out , watch out . Matthew . You got nowhere to go . Give up before anyone else gets hurt . [ Yelling , screaming ] [ Yelling , screaming ] Come here ! Leave me alone ! Can 't do that . I trust Matthew made it to Binghamton safely . Yes , Dr. Rosen . Matthew Hurley is safely tucked away . So let me get this straight . Me and my tactical team have to drug ourselves every time we handle this kid ? Either that or use a Hazmat suit . [ Distant screaming ] What was that , Cley ? Someone else 's problem . I 'm tactical . So back to these injections . Can we use a smaller needle ? That was like a horse shot . My people didn 't complain . Yeah , well , sue me . I 'm human . And so are they . And so is Matthew Hurley . And you need to treat them as such . Do I tell you how to do your job ? How about this ? Don 't get your next handler killed . That was uncalled for . Don Wilson thought he could do his job with his eyes half shut . He botched the red flag roll-up and almost got you and yours killed . Twice . Don 't kid yourself , Doc . This situation , it 's getting worse . Sounds like the stress is getting to you . Would you like to schedule a session ? [ Laughs ] Only therapy I need is a week in Orlando with my wife and kids . You wanna bury your head in the sand , be my guest . Me ? I 'm tired and my arm hurts . So we 're done here . Apparently so . - Hey , Rach . - Hey , Nina . Feeling any better ? You were pretty shaken up . I don 't know anymore . You know , Agent Wilson creeped me out . Did you know that he smelled like stomach acid and Tums ? And now that he 's dead , I feel bad that I didn 't like the way the guy smelled . I 've been trying to forget it ever happened . How 's that working out ? Not so well . When I was upset , I told my mother ... To shut her mouth . And that I hated her , and that I was moving out . I 'm glad something good came out of it . Nina . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna stay with my cousin . She said I could live on her couch for a little while . Comfortable . Look ... I have a three-bedroom loft in Soho . Free rent . You can stay with me at least until you figure something out . I don 't wanna impose . I think we both could use the company . Oh , there you are . Uh , I 'd like everyone in my office . Okay . Here we go again . Bill , I know what happened is very disturbing to all of us , especially what happened to Don Wilson . But it 's understandable , if you- - Yeah , people are there , and then they 're not . And they bashed his brain in with a chair- - - Gary , please--Gary , stop ! - Gary , Gary . Gary , Don Wilson was a federal agent who died doing his job , okay ? You should have a little respect . - Bill , just let it go . - Bill , it 's all right . Let what go ? He should learn to respect- - Gary has his own way of expressing grief . Yeah , that 's just my way . People are there , and then they 're not . As do we all have our own ways of dealing with a traumatic experience . Listen , I don 't just wanna talk about Don Wilson . I wanna talk about us . Is there still an us ? With Wilson gone ? Uh , yes , Nina , there 's still going to be an us . They are not going to disband our team . Agent Sullivan is probably going to replace Wilson . You know , Don Wilson died partially because he did not give us the trust that he should have . We stopped Matthew when no one else could . So yes , we will go on . And we 'll do more than that . We 'll thrive ... As a team . And we will , uh ... We will deal with what life and our handlers throw our way . Which means stopping more Alphas . The Ghost , Marcus , Matthew . You know , nobody can do what we can do . And it 's gonna be messy . I 'm not saying we won 't make mistakes . I mean , none of us are trained for this kind of thing , Bill being the exception . But you know , nobody can deal with the Alpha phenomenon like we can . So life on the cutting edge , huh ? Uh , yeah . Not for the faint of heart . Life ... Life is hard . There 's death . And everybody dies . And ... - Gary . - It 's still humming . There 's still a hum . We 've caught Matthew . But no one has helped me with the humming . No one . Hey , Gary . Yes . Come on , come take a walk with me . Come on . It 's that one- - it 's the ugly gray one . - You sure ? - The ugly gray one , yeah . Okay . Here , stand over here . Watch this . - No , that 's the wrong way . - Wait for it . - No more buzz . - That 's right . Come on , what do you say , we 'll go inside and we 'll , uh , we 'll worry about our future . I 'm not worried . = = sync , corrected by elderman = = Yeah , me neither .

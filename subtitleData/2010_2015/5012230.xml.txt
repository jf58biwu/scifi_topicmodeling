 ( plane engine buzzing ) This better be good , Falkner . Reece , could you park Ms. Moore 's car , please ? Yes , sir . Well , now , Kathryn , that depends on your expectations of good . I mean , I 've had ice cream that 's good . I 've had pizza that 's good . Actually , you know what ? There 's this brick-oven pizza joint down the street . It 's better than sex . Cut to the chase . Are you telling me the device is functional ? I 'm telling you that we- - let 's face it , l- - have redesigned the battlefield of the 21st century . All systems are online . They 're bringing in the test vehicle now . Kathryn : My car ? Relax , Kathryn . It 's a company car . Okay . Get clear . Hurry up . All right , people , safety positions . - Doctor . - Thank you . Woman : Safety perimeter all around the site . Safety perimeter all around . Stand by . Fire it up . ( alarm blares ) Powering to 40 % . ( machinery humming ) 16 teslas and climbing . Engage the degaussing coils . ( humming ) I assume this is all safe . More or less . 24 teslas . It 's not taking effect . Push it up . There 's no turning back now . Now . 32 teslas and climbing . I hope you know what you 're doing . Abracadabra . ( laughs ) Impressed ? Or do I need to pull a rabbit out of a hat ? Woman : 40 teslas and holding . How long can you sustain the effect ? We 're still working on that . Let 's bring her back . - Power down the generator . - Okay . Man : lnputting . Vision to normal . Nice work , Doctor . I 'm sorry . " Nice work " ? You act as though we invented a stronger glue . We just cracked invisibility . Man : 25 teslas . The field 's destabilizing . Who was that ? What the hell ? ( garbled , crackling speech over radio ) ( beeping ) ( alarm blaring ) A magnetic flux spike . This is Vantage 3-5-4 requesting clearance for takeoff . I repeat , this is Vantage 3-5-4 requesting clearance for takeoff . Tower : Vantage 3-5-4 , cleared for takeoff . ( crackling ) ( screams ) Woman : The car 's gone . Woman : Teslas are dropping . Man : We 'll get it stabilized . ( alarm stops ) Distortion lowered . All synchronized . It 's totally fine .

I gave up caffeine when I was pregnant with my first . You should try it . Decaf or pregnancy ? - Both . - ( laughs ) I 'd really like to see you wrangle a toddler . I 'm sure you would .

Broadmore says a ship blew up his runway . All right , I 'll be there . - 10-4 . - Sorry . Duty calls . Go get ' em . Marry me tonight ? I 'll think about it . Thanks , Lena . How the hell did you accomplish that ? I 'm a genius . The board of directors is going to want a better answer than that . The truth is they did some great stuff back in ' 43 , groundbreaking , actually . It 's not like you to share credit . I 'm not . There 's still a patent in this for me . ( siren blaring ) It 's about damn time . Relax , Broadmore . Why don 't you tell me what happened here ? See for yourself . - Dr. Falkner . - Not now , Ramey . We know where the voice signature came from . Great . Fix it . It came from the USS Eldridge . Kathryn : Eldridge ? Carl : That 's a ship . That 's what I 've been saying . Don 't sound so crazy now , do I ? Well , how the hell did it get here ? Well , how the hell should I know ? I heard this crash , and the damn thing was there . Broadmore : " USS Eldridge . " It 's the Eldridge . Dispatch , we 're going to need some serious backup . Call the- - call the National Guard . Call the Navy too . Are you serious , Carl ? There is a World War ll destroyer on the runway . ( electricity crackling ) ( hissing ) ( crackling ) What ? ( sizzles ) Salinger . Salinger . Salinger , if you 're getting this , the ...

Then why is it sitting in the middle of Pennsylvania ? How much of the file did you withhold ? We gave you all you needed . Apparently not . What happened to the Eldridge ? The Eldridge and its crew were lost during the original experiment in 1943 . The ship never decloaked . If this is indeed the Eldridge , we are onto something much bigger than invisibility here . I need the complete file . It 's the Eldridge . I 'm telling you , I have never seen anything like this in all my life . Carl , no , that doesn 't make any sense . The Eldridge ? I 'm staring at it right now . It 's right here in the middle of Springview . I- - - Sailor : Hello ! - Wait . Just wait a second . Is anyone there ? Hello ! Can you hear me ?

You 've been very kind . Thank you . - Do you want your coffee ? - No . ( jet engine roars ) ( cellphone rings ) - Yes ? - T-173 offline . Are you sure ? There was a limited blast wave . Has the asset reported in yet ? Confirmed . Long-red-2 as of now . The Eldridge is gone . It caused some kind of explosion when it disappeared . " Asset " ? Really ? This situation must be contained . The last thing that we need is some video going up to a kid 's blog . No one 's going to believe it . They 'll just write it off as another crop circle or the Loch Ness Monster . ( cellphone ringing ) - Hello . - Lena : Molly . Thank goodness . There was a man in uniform here asking about your grandmother . My grandmother ? Uh-huh , and he wanted to get ahold of the Navy . Lena , what are you talking about ? He said he was a lieutenant . Are you all right , sweetie ? 'Cause he was a little weird . ( cellphone ringing ) Hang on . Yeah , Ramey , tell me you got something . Not yet . We reran the test from the playback , but we still can 't explain the event , and we 've got another problem . The generators are still drawing power . From where ? We don 't know . Go through the back door . Shut those generators down now . - ( lab alarm blaring ) - Wait . We 're getting something . Coils are arcing . They just jumped to 15 teslas . ( groans ) ( groans ) Move .

( groans ) ( groans ) ( yell echoing ) ( cellphone rings ) - Moore . - Are you mobile ? - Yeah . - T-173 is back online . Branch report was downtown Chicago . - You 're certain ? - Yes . - We 're at- - - Send me everything you have . We 're changing course now . Turn around . Get us to Chicago fast . What ? What happened ? The Eldridge is back . ( dog barking ) ( door creaking ) ( floor creaks ) ( gasping ) God . Hello . You 're Molly ... aren 't you ? Hello . I 'm so sorry I scared you . Would you mind if I sat down , please ? I- - ( stammers ) I 'm sorry . I know . We bought this house when- - when Mary , your grandmother ... was pregnant . I had to report back to duty six days later , after your mother was born . It was two two weeks ago . That was 70 years ago . Where 's Annie ? Where 's your mother ? Um ... Annie , my mother she died three years ago . But she grew up her whole life here , and she raised me here . My grandmother died when I was very young , so ... She never stopped looking for you . How- - how is this possible ? How are you- - How are you here ? The- - the device on board the Eldridge , there was- - Something went wrong . I need help . I need help to find someone that can help me understand the program , someone who knew the program . ( cellphone ringing ) Hello . - Molly , it 's Lena . - Ah , Lena . Actually , this is a really bad time right now . Can l- - Well , wait . There 's this weird thing with a ship . A ship ? - Turn on the TV . - Yeah . What ? - It 's unbelievable . - Okay . Now we interrupt this broadcast to bring you this footage from Chicago , where our own Cathy Armstrong is reporting on a bizarre situation unfolding there . Cathy : Well , the only thing we know right now is that the building right behind me was starting ... - Oh , my God . - ... at about 5 : 01 today when a massive sea vessel impacted the upper floors . Now , there 's a likelihood ... - ( overlapping chatter ) - ( sirens blaring ) There was a giant flash of light seconds before ... ( ship crackling , humming ) Yeah , this is probably on a few blogs by now . It 's going up on monitor six along with the corresponding graphic . What do we know ? Well , the ship 's being shielded by a kind of electromagnetic field . And the energy signature is identical to the project that we 're working on at Grey Watch . How do you do that ? I 'm terribly clever . Direct apportation . What does that mean ? Instantaneous transmission of states between two points with no occupation of intervening space and time . English . Okay . Oh . That 's the Eldridge in 1943 . This is us now . Now , according to the classified information- - thank you , Ms. Moore- - the Eldridge crew turns on their phase generator . It overloads and obliterates the ship . However , the Navy was wrong . The ship did not explode , but , in fact , it creates an energy field so powerful , it causes a gravitational tear . What is that ? It 's a rip in space-time , and it pulled the Eldridge through . To where ? It 's not a where . It 's a when . Okay . When we fired up our phase generators in our lab , our field connected ... - ( marker thumping ) - ... with the original . They locked on to each other , and like a magnet , the Eldridge gets pulled through space and time , reappearing right here , today . It 's been 70 years . For us , yes , but for that ship , that would be instantaneous . Theoretically , you could do that whole process again in reverse , sending the ship back in time , creating a whole new history . I could stop World War ll before it even started . Enough . I just want to know how the ship got from Springview to Chicago . So the Navy closed the file after the war , and the technology was sold to Grey Watch . And what 's Grey Watch ? A dead end . Yeah , they 're a weapons developer . Best security in the world . Biggest and most powerful corporation in the country with ties to the government . Well , I 'm sure they 're on the level . ( chuckles ) No . How do you know how to do this ? Um ... I 'm sort of a hacker . How- - a hacker ? A hacker . Can you make money at that ? Let 's just say it 's not exactly on the level . We have surveillance photos from Springview . - The asset 's lDed a survivor . - William Gardner , chief technician on Salinger 's team . If he 's alive , we need him here . Thank you , Doctor . That thought never occurred to me . We have it handled . ( Velcro ripping ) It 's the best I could do , so ... - ( grunts ) - Something wrong ? Molly , l- - I don 't mean to pry . But do you think that it 's proper to have a man 's clothing in your home ? ( laughs ) Well , Bill ... a lot has changed since the ' 40s . And Carl and I are engaged , so ... - Oh . - Well ... almost , kind of- - he keeps asking . You know , Molly , if he is on that ship- - He 's alive . I know it . ( knock on door ) Ms. Gardner , I 'm with the United States government . Do you mind if I ask you a few questions ? ( dog barking ) No , of course not . ( cellphone ringing ) ( chuckles ) Do you mind if I get that ? I 'll just be- - I 'll be right back . No problem . - ( door closes ) - Hello . Listen to me very carefully . You 're in grave danger . Yeah . Yeah , that 's great . Is there somebody else there , Molly ? Absolutely . Listen , get Bill to the pay phone at Sixth and Pine . I 'll call you there . - You don 't have much time . - ( dial tone hums ) Okay . Bye . Urgent call ? Oh , no , no . Just a friend . Of course . Can I trouble you for a glass of water ? Sure . ( water running ) What branch of the government are you from ? You know , it 's funny . People almost never actually look at a badge . Hmm . It 's irresponsible , really . Yeah . Here . Molly , where 's Bill Gardner ? ( floor creaks ) There you are . ( groans ) ( Molly grunting ) You all right ? Come here . Come here . Look at me . Look at me . You all right ? - Yeah . - Okay , come on . Molly : Okay . Radio : lncursion team is in position . This is a science problem . It should be my people . Your people got us into this mess . I 've spoken to the Joint Chiefs . This is now a military problem until it 's no longer a problem . We clear ? Yeah , what are they going to do , shoot it out of the building ? Incursion team is go . ( sirens blare ) All right , let 's go . Lock and load , people . Got it . Bring the torch . Let 's move . Move ! Move ! Move ! Here you go . Watch your back . Go ! Go ! Go ! Now move . Go through stairwell three . Go with me . Move it ! ( ship humming ) And indeed the people of Chicago , the nation , and many around the world watch and wait to see what will happen next as this extraordinary event unfolds . - Molly , l- - - I need help . What 's wrong ? I don 't have time to explain . I need to borrow your car . Okay . And I need some cash . ( siren blaring ) Are you in trouble ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . Okay . Thank you . Let 's go . ( helicopter blades whir ) Approaching 17 . Radio : Copy , 17 . Pick up your feet , fellas . Let 's go . Let 's go . ( phone rings ) Yes . It 's Reece . Put him on speaker . Yeah , go . ( coils humming ) The phase generators are still active , sir . Is it going to jump again ? Yes . The numbers are way outside our data models . - We don 't even have a- - - Get to the point , Reece . The field intensity is exponentially higher than the Springview event . Springview event was a firecracker . This is going to be dynamite . Approaching 23 . Copy , 23 . 24 teslas and climbing . Get your people out of there . It 's happening again . Pick up the pace , Sergeant . Yes , ma 'am . Are you not hearing me ? You are going to kill them all . I want my people on that ship before it jumps . - ( static buzzing ) - You guys hear that ? Let 's go . Let 's go . Move ! Move ! Move ! ( phone ringing ) Hello . Hello ! - Bill Gardner ? - Yeah . Who is this ? - I know about the Eldridge . - ( yelling ) Bill ! Bill . - ( yells ) - Bill , what 's happening ? - Bill . Hey . - ( yells ) Hey , I 'm sorry . I 'm just closing . I 'm looking for Bill Gardner . I don 't know who that is . Let 's try this again . I 'm looking for Molly Gardner . I can 't help you . Are you sure about that ? ( gun clicks ) - Everybody , stand back . - ( siren blares ) No , you can 't go in there . ( crackling ) We 've reached the target . I 'm looking at the hull , but we can 't climb to the top . Cut through the hull . Yes , ma 'am . 31 teslas . ( ship humming ) Sir ? ( team yells ) Sergeant , report . 37 teslas . ( alarm blaring ) Sergeant , do you copy ? ( grunting ) - Hello ? - Hey , hello . I need help . There 's something happening to Bill , and I don 't know what it is . Listen to me very carefully . You must remember these two words , " ivory gate . " Ivory gate . What does it mean ? - He 'll know . - ( dial tone hums ) - What ? Hell . - ( groaning ) Bill . Oh , are you okay ? Get away from me ! Get away . What 's happening to you ? What is happening to you ? I don 't know . It 's the ship . It 's affecting me . ( car alarm blaring ) ( yells ) ( yelling ) - Falkner : It 's going to jump ! - Man : Evacuate , now . Ramey : Energy spike , here it comes . Come on , Molly . ( ship humming ) ( groans ) ( cellphone chimes ) Why are we stopping ? My phone . I 've got a message . - Oh , my God . - What ? Carl called . Carl called . That means he 's alive . ( line rings ) Voicemail : Hi . You 've reached Carl . - Leave a message . - ( beep ) ( speed-dial beeps ) ( line rings ) Hi . You 've reached Carl . Leave a message . Damn it . Molly , are you sure that he was on that ship ? - Yes , I 'm positive . - Look , then- - okay , look . If you want to see Carl again , then we have to keep moving . Molly . Yeah , okay . And boom . These are the most likely locations for the next event . Well , that narrows it down . Yes . Yes , it certainly does . 10 locations across the globe . Right . This is now an international problem . Yes , Ms. Moore ? Get me the Defense Department . Delta Team , you are go for takeoff . Godspeed . Where are we going ? To see Morton Salinger . - The Morton Salinger ? - Yeah . No , that 's not possible . He 's dead . Until yesterday , so was I . I have a timeline . At this rate , it should reappear in just under eight hours . All right . Falkner , you finally have some facts . Now it 's up to me to put it to bed . " Put it to bed " ? I 'm taking that ship out the minute it reappears . We 're talking about a massive electromagnetic field here , and you 're just going to bomb it ? That ship , I need that to go away now in the best and only way I know . Any explosion will be deflected and then magnified tenfold . Do you understand ? You have a better idea ? I need more time . You have until bombs start dropping . - You sure this is the place ? - Positive . Wonder what he looks like after all these years . A little worse for wear , I 'm afraid . Hi . You look ... young . ( chuckles ) You don 't . ( chuckles ) Reece . - ( coils humming ) - Yeah ? You have to shut down the generators now . Sever the link to the Eldridge before it reappears and Moore starts dropping bombs . Otherwise , it 's going to be a catastrophe . - Sir , we 're trying . - Look , I don 't care if you have to hit the thing with a sledgehammer . You shut it down , Reece . Yes , sir . You know , Bill , we were messing with forces more powerful than anything we could imagine . When I couldn 't bring you back , I knew I 'd made a terrible mistake , but I decided right then that I would take the technology to my grave . So then how did Grey Watch get it ? Well , 20 years ago , they restarted the program with the Department of Defense . They tried to recruit me . So you faked your own death ? Well , they 're not the kind of people you want to say no to . We picked up a call . Bill Gardner has an old friend , Morton Salinger . Salinger 's dead . Apparently not . Intel has confirmed a voice match . ( cellphone ringing ) What have you got ? There was a second call from Salinger . Left a message- - ivory gate . Ivory gate ? What the hell does that mean ? I have no idea . I 'll get my people on it . And , Hagan , I want these people brought in , alive if you can , dead just as good . - Dead ? - Understood . You 're going to kill the people that actually developed the Eldridge device ? - They are adversaries . - We need them . They have firsthand knowledge of the project . Salinger knew where to go if he wanted to help us . I was the only survivor . The rest of them were fused to the ship . Where were you ? At my post , monitoring the generator . Proximity . Has to be . Simply put , the generator bonded the atoms of your body to the Eldridge . That 's why I keep being affected every time the ship jumps . Exactly . ( foghorn blowing ) What would happen if somebody boarded the ship later ? Why ? My boyfriend boarded the ship in Springview . I 'm sorry , Molly , but I don 't think anyone could survive . No , he 's alive . He called . - Well , can I see that ? - Yeah . ( gasps ) Hey . ( splash ) - That- - - They can track it . We have to be very careful . Well , this puts me in mind of a jalopy I used to own . Can I drive ? ( chuckles ) Yep . Be my guest . ( crackling , humming ) Reece : Be careful . The circuits to the core have to stay open until you pull it out and bypass it manually . Man : Copy that . How 's the voltage ? Reece : Stable and below limits . Interference on core one . - Complete . - Here . ( hiss ) I can see the power coupling . Stand by . ( screams ) - ( groans ) - Are you all right ? ( phone rings ) - Yeah . - Sir , we 've got a big problem . - ( alarm blaring ) - Gotta get out of there ! - No . - What 's going on ? Get out . Damn it , Reece , what 's going on ? Get out . - Get out ! - Reece ! Move ! Come on ! Come on , move ! Move ! Let 's go ! Reece ! ( static buzzing ) ( phone clatters ) Bill , it 's absolutely paramount we get you back on board that ship . Why ? The quantum link between the two generators can only be severed from the originating point . Meaning the Eldridge ? No , meaning me . I bonded to the Eldridge 's generator . I 'm part of the originating point . You 're the only one who can shut it down . ( tires squeal ) - Bill : They found us . - Salinger : Damn it . Hey , do people still give the middle finger ? Yeah . Why ? - ( bullets pinging ) - Get down ! Get into the woods . Turn right down that dirt road . Get down ! - ( bullets ping ) - Molly : Oh , my ... - Hold on . I 'm going through it . - Watch out ! - I 'm going through it ! - Watch out ! - ( gunfire ) - ( bullets pinging ) I thought you said no phones . This is rather different . The road is booby-trapped a quarter of a mile up . - ( screams ) - The phone ! Damn it . Where the ... Where 's your trap ? Very close , but I need my phone . I got a fork coming up . Left . Go left . ( gunfire continues ) Molly , see if the phone slipped under the seat , your side . Can you see it ? - I see it . - Quick , give it to me . ( Molly screams ) Got it . I got it . There . Come on , Salinger . Where is it ? Coming up . Bang ! ( groans ) Stop ! Stop ! ( engine knocking ) ( Salinger gasping ) Molly : Morton . Morton . Morton ? He 's bleeding . What ? Ah , God , he 's been shot . Is there a hospital nearby ? - No . - Morton- - - Listen . Listen to me . - Oh , God . Listen . You have to get ... on that ship . We don 't have much time . Neither of us do . We can 't do this without you . There 's a team loyal to me . We 've been working on a way to stop this . First ... you and that ship have to get back to 1943 . How ? There 's a research facility outside of Granger . It 's named after me . I know where that is . You ask for Khan . He 's finishing my work as we speak . You must go . I can 't . You must go . Get out of here . It was good to see you again . Good to see you too , old man . He 's right , Molly . We have to go . Okay . Here . Radio : Copy . 2,000 , and will maintain formation . - Time to target ? - ( cellphone ringing ) Time in T-minus five minutes . T-minus five minutes . - Hagan , is it done ? - Copy that . Heading south 500 knots . Damn it . I 'll shut down the whole area . This is Delta Leader , heading 3-0-0 . Approaching target , 250 miles and closing . This is Alpha Leader , heading 1-2-5 , approaching target Charlie . 400 miles and closing . We 're on the line at an 89 approach . Coming up on five now . ... heading , 500 knots . It 's almost time . It won 't work . In fact , it 's just going to make it worse . I 'll be damned if I 'm going to sit around and watch this ridiculous charade . It 's Gardner . He did this . Gardner is phasing , just like the damn ship . Well , this is getting worse by the second . Bill Gardner is the key to this , and if Salinger 's with him , there 's only one place they could be going . And I will be damned if I 'm going to tell Moore . Take me to the airport now . Yes , sir . Salinger : " Let me play the fool . With mirth and laughter , let old wrinkles come . " ( gun clicks ) ( groans ) Where did they go ? ( laughs ) Which way ? Oh , I don 't know . I couldn 't see very well . ( chuckles ) Some dingbat shot me . ( chuckling ) Have it your way . ( gunshot ) Please turn off your engines and remain in your vehicles . We 're performing a routine inspection . Your patience is appreciated . Right there . Right there . Get it up there . Please turn off your engines , and remain ... We have to get across . There 's got to be a way up here . Come on , let 's go . Come on . Open the door , and step back . To the side , sir . - Clear ! - This is going to take ... Sir , get back to your vehicle . Please turn off your engines and stay in your vehicles . We 're performing a routine inspection . - What is this ? - Shh . Your patience is appreciated . Bill : This is not good . Approaching target . Moore : Give the go codes to the pilots . Copy that , Delta Leader . Slow to 3-9-8 . Where 's Falkner ? He should see this . I 'm about to clean up his mess . There 's no other place for us to cross ? No , not for miles . We need transport now . We can 't waste any more time on foot . There . That camper . Once they stop searching it , it 'll be the safest place to hide . Coming up on T-minus one minute . - November 2-0-3 ... - Go codes have been sent . Copy that . Climbing to 10,000 . Weapons test . Delta Leader standing by , looking solid . How much longer is this going to take ? - Be patient . - Any idea when we 'll get ... ( crackles ) ( crackles , hums ) Oh , Bill . - ( humming ) - ( car alarm blaring ) Delta Leader approaching target . We are weapons hot . This is Delta Leader . We have a visual on the target . Repeat , - we have a confirmed visual . - Here we go . Delta Bravo going around to engage . ( car alarm blaring ) Out of the car . What 's going on ? Come on . - Whoa ! - ( screaming ) Let 's go . No , let 's go . Woman : Get a video . We 're at the car . ( ship crackling ) Missiles ineffective . Some kind of shield protecting the ship . Pull up . Pull up . No ! ( monitor beeps ) Delta Squadron is gone . I don 't understand . Delta Leader , report . Delta Leader . ( receiver clicks ) Delta Leader , do you copy ? Damage reports are coming in . The Eldridge took out a nuclear power plant in England . - Where is it now ? - I don 't know . And where is Falkner ? I don 't know . Get me Dr. Falkner immediately . Looks like this is the place . Where is everybody ? I don 't know . Come on . Hello ? Is anybody here ? Khan ? Khan ? ( gasping ) Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . No . No , no , no . - Oh ... - No . No . No . Bill : Shh , shh . Come on , let 's go . Yeah . Okay . Wait . Wait . - Molly , what ? - Wait . Come on ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . - Stop ! - Gun ! Get down ! Get down ! Go ! Go ! ( gasps ) Ah , go . Go . - ( gunfire ) - ( glass shatters ) - ( screams ) - Go , Molly ! Come on . Come on . - ( groans ) - Hagan : Gardner ! ( field crackling ) Give it up , Gardner . I 'll make it quick . Bill : No ! - ( yells ) - Molly ! ( gasps ) ( winces ) You got nowhere to go ! Give yourself up , and I 'll let Molly go . - I 'm here . - What are you doing ? Leave her alone . Let her go . You don 't need her . Let her go . - Please . - I don 't think so . ( screams ) Molly . - You all right ? - Yeah . I think it 's just- - it just grazed . - Come on . - It 's all right . - Come on . Up , up , up . Come on . - Okay . Hey , get in . Who are you ? One of the few people who doesn 't want you dead . Okay , come on . You were right . It was just a graze . You 're going to be fine . All right , suggestions ? The only way to stop this is to get me on board that ship and send it back . Agreed . Therein lies the problem . How ? Salinger said that he 'd figured it out . Yeah , that 's why I took this . Wait . You have their research ? Yep . That 's great . Can we decrypt the data in time ? Yeah , yeah . I can handle it . Apparently she 's a hacker , whatever that means . I 'm in . What do you got ? Well , does the program " Two Point Phase Generator Stasis " mean anything to you ? - Yes . - Yes . So now what ? Now we just got to find the ship . No . No , we 're going to bring the ship to us . Of course . You got- - you got another phase generator . Exactly , at Grey Watch . Okay , let 's get this horse to the barn . ( computer beeping ) Can I help you , Ms. Moore ? Yes , actually . I just found out my jet 's in Granger . If you don 't tell me everything about Falkner 's plan , your brains are going to be all over the wall . ( keypad beeps ) All right , here we are . This is it . Find a station . ( keyboard clacking ) I 'll be damned . Soon as we get Salinger 's program running , we can bring the Eldridge here . That is , assuming we can actually get the generators online . Well , I can help you with that . Okay . Circuit control , field control , magnetic flux capacitator , and ... that 's voltage right there . Okay , are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Because there 's a ... ( power humming ) Okay . Good . It looks a little different , but hertz are hertz , and volts are volts , right ? - And on still means on . - Yeah , that 's true . Okay , now the degaussing control is over here . I 'm going to tackle the initiation sequence . ( alarm blaring ) Molly , start the program . Okay . Here we go . ( winces ) 35 teslas and climbing fast . Slow down . The system can 't handle it . ( winces ) - ( gasping ) - ( metal creaks ) - ( groaning ) - Hey , are you okay ? Bill ! ( crackling ) - He 's phasing with the ship . - ( yelling ) It 's amazing . ( monitor beeping ) 40 teslas ! Hold on to your- - ( rumbling ) ( Bill gasping ) We did it . Are you okay ? Swell . You better be . We 're not done here . Oh , my God . Well , you could have made it a little easier to get on board . How deep does this complex go ? Goes down three sublevels , all accessible by the main stairwell . Let 's get this over with . - I 'm coming with you . - Hey , no . Not a chance . - But Carl is on the sh- - - I will find Carl . I need you to stay here , make sure the ship doesn 't go anywhere else . - No . - Molly ... I need you to stay here . I don 't want to lose you . You won 't . Hey . Keep in touch . I will . Hello , Falkner . I 'm actually impressed . You managed to bring the ship here . That 's what happens when you stop shooting people . You actually come up with solutions . Don 't preach at me , Falkner . It 's unbecoming . - Phone : Go , Agent Moore . - Confirmed . It 's here . Give the go order to the pilots . Yes . Now step away from the console . Come on , Kathryn . We know how to stop this . Just let us finish . She said , " Step away from the console . " Where 's your friend ? Falkner , Molly , can you hear me ? I think I found a way onto the ship . We 'll see about that . And , Hagan , make sure he 's dead this time . ( yelling ) You need to stop this or we 're all going to die . We altered the timeline . We have to fix it . Take the files . Take the research . Take the equipment . Take it all . Just let us finish first . Hell , I 'll even help you dismantle it myself , okay ? That 's a kind offer , Falkner , but my orders are simple- - destroy the ship , destroy the evidence , keep the technology- - which is exactly what I 'm doing . If you interrupt the program , we will lose the Eldridge . It will tear this entire planet apart . No , it won 't . In 10 minutes , that ship , this facility , and all of you will cease to be a problem . Let me guess . More cluster bombs ? Wrong again . The President authorized a low-yield nuclear strike . No , you can 't do that . Watch me . Get moving ! - ( crash ) - ( yells ) ( metal groaning ) ( yells ) ( gasping ) Molly . Falkner , are you there ? Oh ! No . I told you not to move . - Oh , God . - Oh , no . ( alarm blaring ) Falkner . Falkner , look . What does that mean ? I told you . The program is failing . The ship is going to jump again . Hurry up . We don 't have much time . Are you there ? The ship 's phasing . What 's going on ? ( Falkner gasping ) You , start pulling drives . You 're not listening ! We have to send the Eldridge back . If you mess this up , you will alter the very fabric of space and time . You will change our entire history , Kathryn . I 'm trying to preserve our future . Do it ! Oh , God . Carl ! Yeah ! Yeah , over here ! Who are you ? - Molly sent me . - Molly ? Molly ? Where is she ? She 's close by , but we need- - ( groans ) Hey . ( groans ) Stand back . What are you doing ? ( yells ) Go . Get yourself to an outside wall , and get off the ship . What about you ? I can 't just leave you here . I can 't leave . Load those into the truck . ( groans ) ( yells ) Time to shut you down . ( yells ) I 've been looking forward to this . Listen . If I don 't shut this generator down , we 're all going to die . As long as that includes you . Don 't move . Young lady , you 're not- - Okay . Okay , I 'm just going to- - - Let me just get in there . - No . You should have stayed dead . You go . You should find Carl . No . What about you ? Ah , Salinger was right . We 're not ready for this . It ends with me . No . Go . Please . Okay . ( chuckles ) ( gasping ) ( groans ) ( generator humming ) ( yelling ) Get off my ship ! ( Hagan yelling ) Go . Get Molly away from here . No , I 'm not leaving without you . Go ! ( yells ) ( crackling ) ( yells ) Carl . - Hey . - Carl . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Where 's ... - Where 's Bill ? - ( metal creaks ) We got to go , okay ? - No . No . - Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on ! ( metal creaking ) ( alarm blaring ) ( crackling , booming ) - ( metal crashes ) - Watch out . Come on ! ( metal creaks ) Carl : Hurry ! ( yelling ) ( birds chirping ) Hello . Is anybody home ? ( dishes clatter ) Hi , Grandpa . Oh , hi , honey . ( instrumental music playing )

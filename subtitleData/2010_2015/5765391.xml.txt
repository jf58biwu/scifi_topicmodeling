 I want to space on a 13 month solo mission I didn 't go home alone . My husband created a life like android Called it humanity His name is ethan , he 's the protype This is a story about earth Ethan ... . A story about family . A story about survival . Previously on extant ... He is not the same as when I left here . We have to go , right now . No ! Ethan ! He 's changed . And so have you ; that 's called life . Marcus . What ? See for yourself . Completely normal human fetus . What did you do to me ? I don 't know what you mean . Well , I 'm 14 weeks pregnant . And 14 weeks ago , I was in space . I put the family in the spaceship so that They 'd be safe . Safe from what ? Extinction . Why didn 't you call me ? I was worried . I just couldn 't . I 'm sorry . If you 're not ready to talk about What 's going on with you , that 's fine . Is that why you haven 't told john ? What ? That I had a vision of my dead boyfriend And now I 'm pregnant with something I can 't explain ? Harmon is alive . He told me not to trust the isea or anybody . They 'll follow you , they 'll force you into quarantine , And if you tell anybody , Nobody will believe you ! Not even the people you love . With molly , There can be no doubt . You think we found them ? I think they 're already here . I tracked dr . Barton 's car there With the surveillance drone . Sam barton knows ? She knows there 's a baby . That must have come as something of a surprise . She was with molly through all of her infertility courses At the medical center . All unsuccessful . She was pregnant once , but she lost it . It was a previous relationship . Who 's this ? Marcus dawkins . They met in the ascendants program . There was an automobile accident before he had a chance to go up . And that 's how she lost the baby ? Mm-hmm . We have to contain this before she tells anybody else . I 'll take care of molly . What are you gonna tell her ? Something more believable than the truth . I 'm sorry . For what ? I feel like it 's my fault . No , no , molly . Hey . It 's not . We 'll try again . I don 't know if I can . Then we 'll stop . Or we 'll wait . They 're making advancements in stem cells every day . There 's a lab in lucerne That 's on the verge of creating an oocyte . I mean , maybe we can pull some strings and get in a trial . But that 's still experimental . Well , it 's a possibility . I don 't want possibilities anymore . I want something concrete . I want tangible . I don 't want to be disappointed . We 've been doing this for so long . Maybe we have to just face the facts That this isn 't for us . That we 're not meant to have a child together . Molly . What if there 's another way ? I 've interviewed dozens of couples Who want to take him home for the beta testing phase . And he 'd probably do well with any one of them . He 'd get the programming he needs By being a part of a family . But why shouldn 't it just be us ? We have more to give than anyone I know . And if we can 't give it to a child of our own , Let 's give it to him . If he 's going to be programmed By a family experience , why not this family ? Permanently ? Yeah . Let 's-let 's keep him here as our son . Sweetheart , it doesn 't work like that . You can 't just plug and play a family . I know that . But , hey , what 's the saying ? Family is what you make it . If we give it time ... a year , maybe two years ... I just signed up for the rotation on the seraphim . When ? Today . After the doctor . Oh . Um ... When will you know If you 're going up ? I don 't know . I might not go up . I mean , there 's other really qualified candidates , but ... Then we can cross that bridge when we come to it . You don 't want possibilities , you want concrete , right ? Well , this is concrete . This is what we wanted . Morning . Morning . How long have you been awake ? Not long . I was thinking . We should take the morning off . No . Got too much to do . We can 't . No , I can handle it . Ethan 's orientation isn 't until 11 : 00 . I can get him ready , and then I can pick up the cake And the food for the party . I don 't need another party . I just had a party . No , no , no , no . That was a homecoming . This is your birthday . This is not my birthday . No , it 's not . But on your real birthday , You were millions of miles away with nobody to keep you company Or sing to you . Well , not true . Ben sang to me . How was that ? No , really , come on . Let me make it up to you . Hmm ? All morning for yourself . No errands , no obligations . What 's the one thing you want to do the most ? Hmm . Do I have to go ? It 's orientation day at your new school . It 's important . Will you stay with me ? You know I can 't do that . I won 't know anyone . Brynn 's going to be your senior guide ; you 'll know her . By the end of the day , you 'll know a lot of other kids , too . There 's nothing to be worried about . Okay , I have to go pick up some stuff for the party tonight . Mom 's on her way back . Can I leave you with gina for a few minutes ? Yes . Can I trust you to obey the rules ? Yes . What are the rules ? Don 't go outside , don 't answer the door . Good . If you have any problems , gina can call me , okay ? You 've exceeded recommended heart rate . I encourage you to decelerate . Negative . Blood pressure rising . Please decelerate . Negative . You appear to be under stress . Affirmative . You were right . I didn 't think there was a chance in hell That it could be true , but it is . What is ? There 's a covert program in the medical center . They 've been conducting experiments on astronauts , All off the books . For all I know , this is the tip of the iceberg . Why would they do that ? It was an experimental treatment to reverse your anovulation . Nanotech , set to time release . They picked you because you still had samples in storage From your infertility courses . So it 's ours ? Yours and john 's . Well , why wouldn 't they just ask me ? It was a blind test , molly . Given your history , They didn 't want anything to impede The possibility of success . I 'll know more tomorrow . Right now , my primary concern is you . There 's something else going on . Your brain scans are identical to harmon kryger 's . Which makes me think you 're suffering The same hallucinations he did before he killed himself . I 'd feel a lot better If you 'd come in and get checked out . No , no , no . I just got home ; I 'm not going into quarantine . I 'm not talking about quarantine . I 'm talking about a day or two in the hospital With somebody you trust , like sam . John and ethan can come whenever they want . You 're right . I was supposed to protect you , and I didn 't . And I intend to take full responsibility for that . This is going to end a lot of careers , including mine . But before I show myself to the door , I 'd like to do everything in my power to make this right . I got to go . I 'm out of here . Molly ... Molly , I hope you 'll let me help . Okay , everybody , you should have received a checklist For the orientation scavenger hunt in your pre-mailed packet . If you didn 't get one or you need a new one , Please let your senior guide know . Mr. Perry ? Seniors , once you have your student , You can take them to their first session . And , parents ? Hello , parents ? Pickup is Outside the playground entrance at 3 : 30 . Thank you , everybody . Be good to brynn , okay ? He 'll be good . If not , I 'll lock him in the dungeon . It 's illegal to put kids in dungeons . Then I 'd better not get caught . Here you go . There you are . And ... Don 't forget the scavenger hunt . Go get ' em . Dr. Woods ? Hello ? Hi . I am so sorry . Um , some of the parents Would like to ask you a few questions . Sure . I have been working with dr . Woods on this For the last six months , and I can assure you , Neither of us Would do anything that puts any of your children in danger . I believe this was addressed in the pre-orientation packet . This was not in that . Wh-what is your concern ? I work with assembly bots over at the hangar , okay ? You know what happens on the floor there . They put , they put ' em in cages so that people don 't get mauled . He 's not an assem ... Look , we 've given them hundreds of tests over the years ... Empathy tests , uh , right and wrong decision trees . He has passed them all . He 's at a point right now where he needs The thousands of little interactions With his peers every week . Your kids will be an important part of his development . You still haven 't answered the question . Is he dangerous or not ? No , he 's not . I don 't see what 's funny about this . Well , if you 're worried about a little kid ... No , that 's just it ... he 's not a kid , He 's a toaster with hair . Okay , okay , okay . Yeah , he is a toaster ... To you . But to us , he 's our son . Now , I don 't expect you to understand that , and , honestly , I have a hard time with that myself sometimes . He 's not dangerous . He 's just different . And you don 't have to be afraid of different . Your turn . Thank you , julie . Nice . Stop it . Stop what ? Worrying . I 'm sure he 's fine . It 's not ethan I 'm worried about . What , the other kids ? He 's gonna have to deal With them sooner or later . There 's no nature with ethan ; It 's all nurture . Kids his age are not nurturing . It 's the opposite . If you 're even the slightest bit different ... I hear you , jules . But he can 't stay with us forever . He didn 't . John took care of that . Oh , she 's good . She 's up , three-nothing . She isn 't just learning , she 's getting competitive . How many rounds have you played so far ? Six . That 's faster than little man . A lot faster . Nice job , lucy . Shall we play another ? Sure . I know everybody who works in the med center , And they would never do something like that . Well , they said it was some kind of covert program . There 's too much oversight for a covert program . It takes me four rounds of requisition forms Just to get new clipboards around here . But why would he lie ? It 's not like the guy is covering his ass . He practically resigned in my driveway . So what do you think he wants ? Nothing . He just wants me to come in for some tests . He 's worried about my brain scans . Look , No one wants you to end up like harmon kryger . But still ... What did john say ? I haven 't told him . We had the orientation this morning , We have the party tonight ... Molly , You have to tell john . I 'm going to ... tonight , after the party . But right now I got to find kryger . If they 've been testing on me , I 'm sure they 've tested on him . Harmon ? Kryger ? Reminder . Ethan pickup at 3 : 30 . Dr. Woods . I hope I didn 't scare you . I recognized the car ... I wanted to save myself a trip . Uh ... This was recovered In the women 's room at work yesterday . Oh . I , uh ... I must 've dropped it before I left . That 's what I figured . Don 't worry , it 's been sterilized . Okay . Oh ... Put it in whenever you get a chance . I know the director has some concerns about your health . He 'll rest easier once he knows your tether Is back online for monitoring . I 'm late to get my son , so ... Of course . Again , I 'm sorry . I hope I didn 't frighten you . Walk , please . I 'm sorry . We 're walking . Thank you . Thanks . See you tomorrow . Congratulations . Your daughter made friends with the toaster . If molly keeps digging around like this , she will Raise suspicion . No , we will raise suspicion if we Drag her out in the middle of the day . People ask questions . All right , what do you suggest ? I 've known her for a long time . If I can bring her in tonight , quietly , Of her own free will , we can get her to a secure spot With a medical team standing by . That will save us a lot of headache down the line . You 're a good friend . Wow . You think ? Uh ... Wow . For a successful first day of school , And the celebration of the birthday you missed . You really didn 't have to do all this . Well , Just to see you in that dress , it was worth it . Cheers . John , ethan 's requesting Your help in his bedroom . Hmm . The bow tie . Good luck . All right ... Worst thing , best thing . What was the worst thing that happened to you At school today ? They had sloppy joes for lunch . Okay . Best thing ? I made a friend . Oh , I saw that . She said her parents didn 't want me there . Uh , I think her parents Were just a little bit concerned . About what ? Well , because you 're new . You know ? Sometimes people are afraid of new . Why ? Because new means change . You know , it 's nothing you should worry about . You should just keep doing what you 're doing . Huh ? Be kind , be helpful . Be trustworthy . Just like you were today . Ha . There you go . Wait , more stiff elbow , there . Charlie . Stop it . He says it 's the dance of my ancestors . Yeah . Not cool . Hi . Hi . Hey . There 's the schoolboy . How 'd it go ? It was fun . Oh , good . Hi , john . Hey . Welcome . Thank you . Hey , would you like to help me with something upstairs ? Sure . All right , I 'll see you later , okay ? Once I get this to the lab , The dna test shouldn 't take long . I 'm gonna go straight there And then I 'm gonna come straight back . All right . The blue light means it 's ready to draw . It 's gonna sting a bit . You ready ? Yup , go . Okay . You 're doing great . That 's all I need . You okay ? Mm-hmm . Are you sure ? Yup . All right . In two hours you will have all the answers that you need . Oh , thank you . Happy birthday . Okay . I 'll be back . Ooh . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Hey , mol . Hey , look at you . I brought the dip . Nice . See how she treats me ? Tim ? What are you doing here ? Furlough . Six weeks . I ran into bill downtown . He said you wouldn 't mind . Of course I don 't mind . How 'd it go ? At school ? A little bumpy at first , but it all worked out . What kind of bumpy ? Parents . Nothing to worry about . I wish he didn 't have to go through that . Well , I do , too . But he needs school . We can 't just keep giving him the same input , Just you , me and charlie . I don 't think the answer is sending him to school Where we can 't control what he 's exposed to . I don 't want to control what he 's exposed to . He needs random input , not programmed learning . Yes , but if we push him too fast ... Julie , I understand your concern . I do . And you 're absolutely right . He may get some bad input from other kids . But if he does , We 'll just balance it out with the good . I just don 't want anything to jeopardize our work . Or him . Julie , this is much more than my work now . It 's my family . Excuse me . Come on . Wow . John . So , hey , I lost track of you after you got on the boats . Where you been ? I sent a couple postcards . What , eight years ago ? Eight years . Look , I ... I hit a rough patch after marcus died . And having that distance from everyone ... I don 't know , but somehow it helped . I think if anyone can understand that ... I do . He was your brother . I am sorry . About what ? For not being there for you after the accident . Oh , tim . Look , I know how hard it was for you After losing him and losing the baby . It was just so much for you to handle . I guess I just didn 't know where to start . Well , there wasn 't anything anybody could do . I just had to push through it , Every day , all by myself . Do you ever see him ? Marcus ? I do . All the time . I mean , I-I know it 's not really him . Just a stranger or Someone on the street that looks like him . With those eyes . Those eyes , they 'd cut right through you . Used to hurt like a punch to the gut . Now I see it as him sending me a message . What kind of message ? That even though he 's dead , He 's always gonna be with us . One way or another . That we 'll be all right . Yeah . Okay , listen up , we 're gonna do a group picture . So everyone come on over here . Get real close and centered and ... All right , squeeze in . All right . Big cheesy smiles , here we go . One , two , three . Smile . Sorry . Hang tight , everyone . - I 'm gonna get some candles . - That 's like The third one this month . I 'll Kick on the generator . What ... ? Did you do this ? Yes . When ? This morning . You went outside when you weren 't supposed to ? Why ? I was going to come back and play with it . This is exactly what I 'm talking about . You-you can 't do this kind of thing . I wasn 't going to hurt it . Well , it didn 't have any food or air . It could have died in here . I 'm sorry . You remember what I said about people being afraid of you ? You have to be more careful than other kids ; You won 't have the same chances they do . Do you understand ? Yes . Good . No more breaking the rules , no more birds . And no more secrets . Mom said that secrets are okay If you don 't want someone to worry . She said that ? Does your mom have a secret ? Sorry . About time . Seems like that took a long time , actually . Hey . What 's going on ? Are you keeping something from me ? Ethan told me . Told you what ? That you were keeping a secret . Do you think we could talk about it after the party ? No , I don 't want to talk about this after the party . I-I-I-I think I 've waited long enough . So just please tell me . Okay . This is ... This is why he 's having problems . He-he 's , he 's lying , molly , he 's , he 's disobeying me . And so this is my fault ? No , he just reflects what we give him . And we can 't get back on track if you don 't want to tell me What 's going on with you . You know what ... You can keep all the secrets you want . Please , just Don 't involve our son . I 'm pregnant . Why would you say something like that ? Because it 's true . How is that even possible ? The isea did it . What ? Sparks said They implanted something inside of my body . They took our samples with some kind of time-release system And then-then they did all this without my consent . When 'd you find out ? When I got home . You 've been dealing with all of this Since you got home ? Molly . Hey . I didn 't tell you because I was scared . Of what ? That you wouldn 't believe me . Of course I believe you . Why wouldn 't I believe you ? Are you okay ? No . We 'll get through this , okay ? Okay . John ? We 're waiting for you guys for the video . Ethan and I , we felt bad that you were gonna miss a lot While you were in space this year , So we came up with an idea ... I came up with an idea . You 're not gonna miss a thing . Hey , molly ! So I just got out of the dmv , And guess what , I 'm licensed ! Molly , whatever you do , Please stay in outer space , okay ? Because it 's really not safe down here . - I 'm a good driver . - Don 't listen to her ; I 'm great . Hey . Why aren 't you downstairs watching the video ? Your room is looking pretty cool these days . You still have it . It 's the one that you gave to me . Yeah . Long before you ever got your body . At night , your dad would go home and I would stick around And I would sit in front of the screen And I would turn out all the lights except one . Then I 'd read it to you . We must have read this book 200 times . Didn 't you get bored ? No . I could never get bored with this book . In fact , I 'd read it right now , You know , if someone asked me to . Would you read it to me ? Well ... Okay . Hold on . Now I 'm ready . Okay . Ready ? " there was once a velveteen rabbit , And in the beginning , he was really splendid ... " What 's going on ? They 've got the whole wing sealed off . Some kind of chemical leak . Chemical leak ? Yeah , they 've got the hazmats And the whole nine yards . Well , I just have to get into my office . Uh , it 's probably gonna be a while . Sorry , dr . Barton . Okay . You 're coming home tomorrow . It 's been excruciating at times , for various reasons , but , uh ... You 're always worth the wait . I love you . Come back . Fast . Quickly . Now . Well , you guys know I 'm not really good at giving speeches . I spend most of my time talking to computers and dead worms . But I have to say , after 13 months in space , I have realized what 's really most important in life , And ... I 'm looking at it right now . It 's friends . It 's family . And , well , it 's all of you , so ... Thank you for being here . Thank you for doing this . Really . And , um , now ... It 's time for you to get the hell out of my house . No , just kidding . Stay around . Drink , eat . Have fun . Thank you . Where 's tim ? I want to say good-bye before he goes . Tim ? Yeah , marcus ' brother . Tim , who used to work on the boats ? That tim ? Yeah . He 's here . No , he 's not . Yeah , he is . He came with bill . Tim . No , molly , molly , He 's not here . I just saw him . He 's here . Tim . Tim ? Tim . He 's not here . Yeah , he-he is here . He 's ... Right ... Smile . Quarantine ? Not after what they did to you . Whatever 's going on In my brain is getting worse and fast . Okay , but I 'll take you somewhere else . Where else am I gonna go ? Anywhere but not with him . Sparks has nothing to do with this . You believe that ? Well , I have no reason not to . And sam is gonna be there . And I trust her . Hey , hey . How long has this been going on ? Since I was on the seraphim . Before I came home . I saw somebody . Who ? Marcus . And-and tim ? Tim is a whole other story . I spent the whole night talking to him . I saw other people talking to him . I can 't keep going on like this , john . Something is happening to me . It was a lot easier when I only had to worry About one crew at a time . Make sure everyone was safe , Make sure they all got back alive . Now I 've got 20 different missions going , Teams rotating in and out . I thought I had a handle on it , But after my daughter died up there , After katie died , I was probably due a career change . I just didn 't see it ending like this . How much longer is this gonna take ? Let me see if I can get an answer for you . I have dr . Barton here wondering when she can get In her office . Please advise . Someone will be here in a minute . Tell them I 'll come back later . Dr. Barton 's computer goes to the lab . All files on molly woods , everything . Molly , you have a call from dr . Barton . - Sam ? - Where 's molly ? She 's on her way to see you at the med center . Who 'd she go with ? Director sparks . Sam ? Call ended . Oh ... Dr. Barton . Yes ? Where are you taking me ? Molly , you 're going to be fine . You just have to trust me . Pull over . I can 't do that . Pull over ! Molly . Molly , stay in the car . Pull over ! Clear . They 're gone .

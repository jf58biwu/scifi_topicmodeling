 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha I don 't know how ... you got a phone call . We 've got to get there as fast as we can . It 's going to be hard enough for them to accept Elizabeth without confusing the issue with gene therapy . It 's my advice that you don 't talk about it . Oh , and we should ... have the receptors removed from these pictures before before they are handed out to the press . - Leak or no leak , I don 't think we should be considering this at all . We 're not ready . Elizabeth just started her treatment with ... we 're not even close to presenting our work to the public . I 'm not prepared for anyone to see Elizabeth and I 'm not prepared to release any of my research data . I 'm not sure that you have to . I think it 's perfectly acceptable to announce it today without having everything lined out . They 're going to want to see her . Of course they 'll want to see her , but we have the pictures . and it 's still better than not getting ahead of the story . - We 're not prepared . OK. if we 're not prepared to talk about her , we 're not prepared to talk about their reactions to her , about any of it . It 's my strong opinion that we wait . - Well , we can 't wait . It 's already out there . It 's a gaining momentum as we speak . It 's just going to get more and more intense unless you find a way to control it . - You don 't have a choice . - Of course we have a choice . This is our research . OK ? This is our ten plus years of work . What happens when they start distorting your research or they start reporting hearsay ? or for that matter , they paint whatever picture they want ? - OK , gentlemen . Please . Now , Sidney ... What do you think ? Whether you go public now , or a month for now , you are going to be facing potentially serious consequences . - I thought we were covered . - Yeah , we are . In this state , what you did would be considered felony . But since you didn 't conduct the experiments here , you 're within the law . - That is not my concern . Then what is ? It 's what we have them prepared for that I am most worried about . This is all new territory . We just don 't know . At this state , the federal government local authorities , religious groups ... you , my friend , are going to have a big target on your back . Oh , hi ... Hi , Mary . Hello , ma 'am . Did Victor call ? No , not yet . Is he do in tomorrow ? I 'm not sure . Girls , will you go with Mary , please ? Mommy 's not feeling very good . I 'm going to go lie down , OK ? Thank you . Good morning . Thank you for coming . My name is Dr. Victor Reed . Over the past ten years , through private financing , I put together a state-of-the-art research facility and handpicked a team of scientists from across the country in order to study and implement groundbreaking genetic and biological experiments . I 'm here to report that on December 2nd , Elizabeth was born . To my knowledge she 's the first human clone . She 's been alive for a little over a month . She will not be joining us today , as she is not yet ready to leave her controlled environment , but I have arranged for photographs of her to be submitted to all of you . I see this as a defining moment in science and our progress as human beings . It 's my privileged and honor to share this great news with all of you today . We will be significantly closer to cures for Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , and so many other diseases as well as leading to all kinds of incredible advantages we have not yet imagined . OK , thank you . I will now take questions . Dr. Reed , Dr. Reed , when can we see her ? She will be ready in about a month . At that point in time I will allow my peers to examine her and independently report their findings . Who was Elizabeth 's donor ? Me . I was the main donor . Are you the father ? Yes , I suppose you can look at it that way . I am also biologically her brother . Was there more than one donor ? Yes , as I stated , the cell 's DNA sequence , my DNA sequence was altered so she would not be an exact copy . You probably already heard some of the many problems associated with cloning . Whose DNA was yours mixed with ? I 'm not at liberty to disclose that information . I 'm only at liberty to disclose my own involvement . Like I said ... Dr. Reed , who is the mother who gave birth to Elizabeth ? I 'm not at liberty to disclose that information . As you know , most Americans believe that human cloning is morally wrong and it goes against God 's will . How do you respond to that ? Well , I would say that all life is precious in God 's eyes . Dr. Reed , Dr. Reed ... Where is she now ? I 'm sorry , I can 't tell you that . That 's all the time I have for questions right now ... Thank you all for coming . Thank you . I don 't want to . My love , do you think I like mine ? Yes . I ate all of it . You know what happens when I eat a big meal like that ? - What ? - I go to sleep . Oh , thank you so much ! I thought I was going to fall in my food . I hear something . You think somebody 's home ? Daddy ! Hello , sir . Where 's Claire ? She wasn 't feeling well , so she went to bed early tonight . Is there something wrong ? No . So , they 're taking care of the girls now ? Who ? Mary and Richard . They 're a lot to deal with . I need the help . Did you see them ? Listen , Claire . I need to talk to you for a moment . Sorry , I 'm going to lie down with the girls . Now , Ethan is terminal . He may last a week , he may last ... He may last a month , it 's hard to say . You know in hospices ? OK , I want you to think of it like that . OK , ready ? Say ' wake up ! ' Wake up ! Good morning , sir . Morning . I 'm sorry to bother you sir , but We should We need to talk about Ethan . Is there a problem ? Yes . He 's ... gotten out of control . We 've been waiting for you to come home to talk to you . It 's just ... He 's become ... He 's getting worse . If you just come see for yourself ... Yes . I 'll look in on him . I can 't today , but maybe tomorrow . That 's fine . Human cloning . What was once a debate about a hypothetical possibility Now appears to be reality , and it 's reignited an intense ethical debate . Dr. Victor Reed announced in a press conference yesterday he cloned the first human being , calling her Elizabeth . Joining me now is a leading genetic scientist from Darton University Dr. William Scott . Now Doctor Scott , you 're the camp of this belief , why do you think this is a fraud ? Well , I 'm not saying that it 's a fraud , per se , but it is hard to believe . But let 's just say that it is true and that he 's succeeded in the birth the child will most likely be born with severe abnormalities and most likely not survive for more than a few months . You see , for a donor nucleus to develop into a clone ... Mommy ! I 'll be there in a minute . Why didn 't you call me , James ? Because there is nothing to worry about . There 's nothing to worry about ? - It 's infant eczema . I 've already treated it with a simple skin cream . You treated her ? Yes . Did you agree to this ? I had stepped out of the room , but she told me about it as soon as I returned . We 're talking about a harmless skin cream . I 'll decide what 's harmless . Subject number M-124 . OK . It 's target 1-75-3350 OK . We 're ready for her . Yes . Uh-hum No , I couldn 't ... couldn 't say . Is Laura still here ? Excuse me . You 're not allowed down here . Oh . I was looking for the cardiology floor . How 'd you get down here ? I 'm sorry . I must have gotten lost . This isn 't the cardiology floor ? No . What 's down here ? Sir ... You need to turn around ... and leave this floor . Sir , you need to leave right now . Alright . I 'm leaving . Must have gotten lost . Have you seen him before ? No . He 's never been on this floor ? - Was he aggressive to you ? - Yes . OK . Would you recognize him again if you saw him ? - Yeah . Absolutely . OK . Doc . Here 's what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to post a man at each of the entrances coming on this floor Ethan . Where are you ? Ethan ! Ethan ? Where are you ? There you are ! Are you hurting ? What did you say ? Ethan , what did you say ? Can you say Mary ? Mary . That 's ... that 's my name . Mary . Oh , let 's try your name . Ethan . Eee-than . Ethan . You can do it . Eee ... Enough . Now stop it . Ethan . I said stop it ! Do you want me to take that toy ? Ethan , Ethan . We 're looking into this to see if he 's broken any laws in this state . At the very least , though , the state holds a right to examine the baby , make sure she 's not a health risk to the community ... we petition the court to do just that . Well , what if she is a health risk ? I 'm not in position to answer that . It 's going to be up for the courts to decide . I will say this , though . There are a lot of people upset about this , including me . I 'm not going to sit idly by . I want answers . We 're not just talking about state and federal , we 're talking about God 's law . ... reaction continues following Dr. Reed 's shocking announcement . Protestors are gathered outside Parkland hospital where Dr. Reed is rumored to be keeping the cloned baby . Hospital officials aren 't confirming if baby Elizabeth is indeed inside . But rumors continue to draw out crowds . Police said one point breaking up an angry group of protesters forcing them out of the hospital 's property . Now , joining us live at the studio is our medical expert Dr. Rachael Morison and Dr. Morison , what do we know about Dr.Reed ? Well , we know he received his doctorate at MIT in 1994 and then he did a surgical residency in Johns Hopkins . But this is where it gets pretty hazy . - Where have you been ? - We have confirmed reports that he spent several years out of the country . - Working . - You didn 't call . The girls were expecting you for dinner and I didn 't know what to tell them . Now that you 're home , you have to call . Not for me , but for your daughters . I don 't know what to say.You know what we 're working on . This is just the beginning , isn 't it ? I don 't mean to sound harsh , but right now this is more important . Fish is coming through , fish is coming . Dr. Reed is home . You better take a look . When did it start ? Oh it 's ... Going off to take it home . Did you feed him ? No , I won 't feed him when he 's like this , you know that . Don 't worry about it . He 'll calm down in a little while and I 'll take care of the thing . This is different . I don 't like it . Would you listen to him ? He never stops . He 's in a lot of pain . You always say that . Did you give him his medicine ? Yes . Then why is he acting like this ? I thought the medicine was supposed to help . When 's it going to stop ? - I don 't know , Mary . I don 't know . I 'm not a doctor . So I don 't know . You know how it is . You just have to wait it out . Besides , he 's coming tomorrow , right ? He 's going to come tomorrow , and look at him and then , you know ... we 'll take it from there . Did you see all the security ? Yeah . He brought the baby home . Really ? Did you go ? Did you see her ? She looks normal . I gotta go lie down . I 'm sorry . I 'll be right back . Victor . Victor ? What is it ? You need to wake up now . There are people outside . Dr. Reed , we need to get you back to the house immediately . When did all this happen ? They 've been coming in all morning . - Did you call the police ? - Yes sir , they 've been notified.They are on their way . I have more men coming . But right now we need to get you back up . This is insane . So that 's another indication that our sources are right . That baby Elizabeth may very well be right here at Dr. Reed 's estate . We know Dr. Reed is here . We know there are several guards on hand . Well , Jaime , would you say the intense security presence is a pretty good indication ? Certainly . And as big as the story is , It 's likely they 'll be here a while . Thank you , Jaime . And now we have exclusive breaking news and extraordinary development in this story . There 's one picture submitted by Dr. Reed to the press that has been the only glimpse the world has seen of this little girl until now . We have never-before-seen photos of Baby Elizabeth . They were taken by an anonymous source inside the Reed estate . As you can see , there 's a mysterious device on her forehead . To find out what that might be , we have asked medical and science expert Dr. Laurence Freeman to join us . Dr. Freeman is a professor in both biology and genetics ... - Sidney ? - Victor ? So glad you answered . I have something urgent . - have you seen what 's going on outside my house ? Yes , I know . I 'm afraid there 's more . I have a source over at the governor 's office They 're building a criminal case against you . You 're going to be arrested , Victor . Most likely in the next day or two . They 're having a hard time charging you with cloning . So they 're going to charge you for transporting her into this state . They 're using it to get a court order to examine Elizabeth . No , no . Did not hear what I said ? She 's not ready yet . I need at least another month . They can do all the examinations they want , can you not convince them of that ? I 'm sorry . We can 't stop this . My advice is cooperate . Let them see her . Damn it ! God damn it ! He had to break something natural about the human cycle . Um ... it 's not a matter of can we , it 's a matter of should we , I guess . I just think we 're going to lose something valuable to us If we just start manufacturing people . I can 't imagine a world where we are vegetables . You know ? Growing in some farm . You 're playing with things we as humans have no business playing with . This is something only God can can ... take care of . Well , I don 't know why everybody 's so upset about this . I mean , they 're pretty incredible . and I think we should give this a chance . We don 't know where this could go . - This is a violation . God is the author of life . Not Dr. Frankenstein over here . God is the author of life , who would think anything other than that ? I 'm concerned for her well-being , and I 'm here to help save her . and to make sure she 's not being harmed . Because if ... if she 's being harmed , she needs to be taken away from Dr. Reed and be given to someone 's who 's going to care for her and take care of her as the person that she is She 's not a test subject . It 's very important to us that cloning continues . - Yeah . I have a brain disorder and there 's no chance for me and for millions of people like me . and this ... this is a hope . This is a reality . Richard , are you home ? What are you doing ? Oh , you 're not hungry ? Are you feeling well ? You have to eat now . Come over here . OK , I 'm leaving . I have to go . Are we going to reverse the aging process ? Reverse heart attacks ? Are heart attacks still the number one killer in this country ? Or we could replace organs , replace skin for burn victims , help for spinal cord injuries , Down 's Syndrome , potentially cures for cancer ! Parkinson 's , I mean the list just goes on and on . This is a real scientific breakthrough . We need to be applauding this man . Seriously ? Applauding this man ? For what ? For destroying our family structure ? Let me ask you something . Is he going to be the father AND the brother ? Is he going to be the mother ? This is terrifying . Think about it . Clone after clone after clone after clone We will have no idea where something begins and where something ends . No more fathers , mothers , brothers , sisters , cousins ... we will just bleed into some huge genetic mess ! Welcome to our brave new world . Dr. Stewart , why did you decide to come forward with these pictures ? Well , I ... I had several reasons . But ... mostly it was Dr. Reed 's treatment of Elizabeth . I felt that it was ... inhumane and borderline abusive . What was inhumane about it ? Well , for one it 's extremely too rigorous for a newborn . Sometimes Elizabeth would go under good treatment for six hours straight . and ... how am I to believe him when he says that that 's safe ? This is ... this is the first infant to ever undergo this treatment . So how can he possibly know what 's safe ? How can anybody know what 's safe ? You want ... this one or this one ? Which one do you like better ? - That . But you already got one ! You can have this one ... oh , you can have this one , too . Be very careful . Don 't touch them yet . You want this one ? - Uh-huh - No ? No ? OK , you can have one of these that we knock over . Now , we have to be very careful , right ? I 'll take it from here . Are you sure ? What are you going to do with the body ? Incinerate her . Let 's try it again . Are you going to be ready , captain ? Were the girls OK ? Are they with Richard ? They 're downstairs . Is it OK if she 's up here ? Do you want to hold her ? God is not science ! God is not science ! Humans , not clones ! Humans , not clones ! Humans , not clones ! We are finally going to have our voices heard . - Amen . God is not science ! - Yeah ! - God is not science ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! Why do I do it ? With all the difficulties ? The awful mistakes ? Ambition ? Try ... to create a good ? To tell you the truth , I don 't know , Claire . I never stop long enough to ask . I 'm not very good at this . But I 'll try . I 'm sorry . Claire . What are we going to do about it ? Humans not clones ! Humans not clones ! Humans not clones ! Humans not clones ! Science is wrong ! Science is wrong ! Science is wrong ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! There 's evil among us ! Science is wrong ! How long will they be out there ? I don 't know . We have to leave . OK ? Just ... - OK . Just backing off for a few days . We 'll suffer the rest . Science is wrong ! - Science is wrong ! Science is wrong ! - Science is wrong ! - There 's evil among us ! - There 's evil among us ! - There 's evil among us ! - There 's evil among us ! My goodness ! Hey , big girl ! Can I hold her ? No , not right now . - Maybe when she gets a little ... - Mommy , is that your baby ? - No , she 's not my baby . - Is your sister going to keep her ? No , but ... she 's going to stay with us for a little while , ok ? - Hi Mary . - Hi , Mary ! Hi girls . Get off the bed . Mary 's needs to make the bed . Quick , quick , quick . Will you all be alright on your own tonight for dinner ? Oh , I think we 'll be fine . I think you should just go home and get some rest . She 's so adorable ! She just now woke up . She 's been sleeping , and sleeping . Do you want to hold her ? Mary ! Mary ! Stop ! Mary ! Mary ! Stop ! Sorry . - What 's wrong ? - I can 't take it . What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? - I want to leave . - What happened ? Mary , what happened ? Would you please talk to me ? I need to know what happened . I want to leave . OK . Nothing happened . I 'm just tired . - Let me go ! - I talked to him . I talked to him just now . Five minutes ago . I called him . I talked to him . He said come over in the morning . He 's going to check on Ethan . That 's what he said . Listen , once he sees Ethan , he 's going to know what to do . Oh , God . How is she holding up ? Beautifully . This is what he said all he wanted was to rest among the reeds - It 's round . - Yes , we 're ... are we ... are we ... are we which are we in agreement that this is a duck ? - Yes . - Ok . Alright , so ... If this is a duck , was is this ? - A rooster . It 's a rooster . I can tell it 's a rooster . Not a chicken . What does it mean to be human ? We are flesh and blood . We are living , breathing organisms . When we talk about changing ourselves from my perspective as a doctor and biological scientist , we talk about altering our genetic structure . Our biology . What 's on that ? - A butterfly . - That 's right . It 's a butterfly . Can we take ... take the camel ? You want to take the camel ? We can . Ok ... the ... Dr. Reed ! James ? The girls wanted to see Elizabeth . Can you watch them for a second ? That 's how we found her . Is she going to be Ok ? Ethan ! Oh , my God ! Claire ! You lied ! Time and time again , all you do is lie . If I told you the truth , you would have left ! I made a decision . A bad decision . I thought this was the more humane way . He was never ... supposed to live this long . He was harmless . I swear . I couldn 't kill him , Claire . I tried . Believe me . I tried . Claire ! Claire ! Richard ... Richard ... Where 's Ethan , Richard ? Where did he go ? I 'm sorry , but there 's nothing we can do for her now . I want you to listen to me . This is important . I need to know how much he 's grown . How tall is he ? Around four feet . Maybe . Jesus . You did this . You did it . This is your fault . It 's your fault . It 's your fault . You did this to him . Hey . Are you with me ? Claire ? Come on . Will you at least hear me out ? Claire . You 're upsetting the girls ! Listen to me . We need to leave here tonight . Alright ? Claire , Claire , answer me ! Listen . There nothing ... to worry about . I found him and I 'm taking care of it right now . Just ... You and the girls be ready to leave , ok ? What are you doing ? Have you fed her ? I was about to . After you fed her , take her upstairs to Claire . She has no soul ! She has no soul ! Do you know what that means ? Do you know what that means ? She has no soul ! You know what 's next ? You know what 's next ? You are going to die ! Hey , hey hey ! What 's going on ? Hey ... Can you help me pick this up please ? Slow down . Quiet ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail go to hell ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail go to hell ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail go to hell ! Listen to me . I want you to stay here on the bed and do not move from this spot . - Ok ? Do you hear me ? - Yes . - Ok ? Answer me , are you saying you gonna get this ? Victor ? James ? Oh , stop ! Oh , no . The girls ! Go get the girls ! No , no . You stay right there . Stay right there . Oh , no , no , no . Hey . You 're doing good . I just need you to ... Now , no ! Ethan , no ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail , go to hell ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail , go to hell ! Dr. Frankenstein , go to jail , go to hell ! Is this who you 're afraid of ? Is this who you 're afraid of ? You think she doesn 't have a soul ? I promise you , she is closer to God than any of you ! What does it mean to be human ? We are flesh and blood ... We are living , breathing organisms ... When we talk about changing ourselves from ... from my perspective , We talk about altering our genetic structure . Our biology . And we 're understanding life in an incredibly rapid rate now . So much so that we are beginning to be able to intervene in the process of our own evolution . Speed it up . Take control of it . Scary or exciting . This leads me to Elizabeth . You see , Elizabeth is not just a human clone , She 's been undergoing an intense gene therapy program whereby we are altering her genes and making her stronger . We are actually expanding the use of her brain . So in essence , she will be a smarter , stronger version of us . And with this new technology we developed every new life in the world can have the same treatment . Our genetic structure will no longer be left for fate. it will in our hands . We are on the brink of a new human evolution . And it 's not a matter of if we go down this path , because we are , It 's a matter of how we meet this future , and how we allow it in our hearts . And in our souls .

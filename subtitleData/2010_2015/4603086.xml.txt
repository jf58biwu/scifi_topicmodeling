 '13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives 'and it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . 'There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall , 'her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , 'a school girl investigator across the road 'her adopted daughter from another world 'and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . ' Ready ? Always ! Hi ! I 'm Joseph Serf . Something weird happened . He glitched . 'Enhancing . ' If I could speak to Mr Serf , just to tell him there are no glitches . Meet you both back here in half an hour . Call me Sarah Jane . They 're controlling him . Gotcha ! Let her go . She 's just a child ! YOU ... YOU ... YOU ... YOU ... They 're going to kill us . You must escape . Run ! What ? What ? What do you know ? Who do you work for ? Mr Harrison . This is not exactly a new experience for me . 'You 're not going to fire that gun . ' Do you want to bet ? I don 't think you 've ever fired that gun . No . But there 's a first time for everything ! I 'm walking out now . You won 't stop me . Sky , what are you doing ? Grab her ! Lipstick that bites ? How very interesting . 'What are you doing down there ? ' Level five , PUNISH ! Luke , make it stop , make it stop ! I can 't ! Work , work ! I 'm sorry ... I must have blunked out there for a second . My goadness , what 's happening ? Plark , forget it . It 's too late now ! What are they doing in there ? No ! Emergency ! Intruders in Light Chamber ! Luke , Sky , get out of there ! Run , run ! Come on ! No ! Should be back by now . Come on , Luke , answer ! Sky , answer , come on ! 'Pick it up for once , Sarah Jane ! ' That 's my phone ! Welcome to the club . I 've had seven phones in the last two years . Sarah Jane ! Mum ! Thank goodness you 're all right ! Bizarre ! I expected high-class industrial spies , not Mumsnet Mum , the hologram . There are aliens working it . They 're slaves ! Coming , Master ! Plark . Master ? You let these human children roam free ! Master , no , please , master ! Level seven , PUNISH ! Master ! Aagghhh ! Stop it ! You 're hurting these creatures ! Poor little Skullions ? Read my lips , Pollyanna . I. Don 't . Care . Plark , get back to work ! Thank you , Master . Love master ! What are you doing to them ? The Skullions ? They merely need a firm hand . Listen , I can help you and help them , I can get them home . I don 't need your help , I 'm doing fine ! They 're intelligent , you can 't treat them like that ! Can 't I ? I paid enough for them . You bought them ? ! A ship crash-landed in Central Asia . The survivors were put up for sale . What do you mean , " up for sale " ? Didn 't you know ? There 's a black market in alien species . If you know where to look . They 're smuggled across Europe in crates , then across the Channel . A slave trade in aliens . Packing them up in boxes , torturing them . It 's appalling ! I can 't believe anybody could be so ... Successful ? You 're so naive . This is the way the world works . Not in my world ! Yes , it is . Money is exchanged for goods and services . Plenty of bidders at auction , but I paid millions . To make billions . It 's disgusting . You 're disgusting ! I do my best . I 'm beginning to understand this . There 's nothing special about the Serf Board , is there ? It 's rubbish , yes . It 's not the board , it 's Serf , the hologram . He 's hypnotic . He can make you desperate to buy one . Very good , carry on . In a few hours , the launch ... it 'll be televised the world over . Serf hypnotises the entire world to buy a Serf Board . And you make a fortune ! That 's all it is . The slaves ... just money ! Just profit ! Shock , horror Right , enough debate ! Put the kids in storage five . No , you leave my children alone ! Luke , you look after her ! I will ! You dare harm my children ... I 'll deal with them , and you , later . After the launch . This way . I 'm going to stop this . I am going to stop you . - What are you going to do ? - Hit me with your handbag Are you hurting them ? Are you hurting the little people ? You are SCUM ! Hold on , hold on ! I 'm a prisoner just like you ! The aliens aren 't bad , Harrison is . How could he do that ? It just makes me so ANGRY ! Humans used other humans as slaves for centuries . Every culture , the world over . Nobody challenged them until a few hundred years ago . And in some places it still goes on . Is this what humans are like ? Not all of them . I can sleep somewhere else in the house . What ? If you want your room back . I think it upset you but ... you 're not telling me . It doesn 't matter . And this isn 't the time ! This morning a little man pulled me into the lift . The guards came , they hurt him . I saw others , many others . The guards locked me away . The Skullions . One of them must have tried to escape . They must be desperate . They 're dying ... and we will die here too . No ! We 're going to get out of here ! And the little people , we MUST help them ! Sarah Jane Smith . Adriana Petrescu . Adriana , you 've just restored my faith in the human race ! In just two hours time the Serf Board will be revealed to the world , 'right here at Serf Systems . 'The eyes of the world will be on this building . 'After months of rumours , leaks , 'some say deliberate leaks , 'and endless speculation , we 'll finally get the answers 'revealed by the secretive Mr Joseph Serf . ' 'That was the latest news transmission . ' We 've got to get over to the launch . We can take Luke 's car ! Clyde , it 's the media event of the century . We can 't just gatecrash it like it 's Adam Jenkins ' party ! Give me a minute . Mr Smith ! Access Serf Systems hospitality . Get your best clothes . 'Accessing initiated . ' Move ! 'Logging in to Serf intranet . ' Bring food for the young ones . You like us , prisoners . Thanks . You need this more than we do . No , you drink . Pure water burns . What do you drink ? Orange , lemon juice , citrus . Hey , stop ! No ! Girl stay ! We can help you , let us out of here ! You stay ! Or master punish ! You need help . No . No help ! You stay ! He can 't go against his master , or he gets another shock . The collars are controlled through Harrison 's pen . We can 't do anything to help the slaves until we get it off him ! If we could tell Clyde and Rani , get them to grab it . How ? They 've destroyed our phones . What about your dog whistle ? K9 's miles away , he 'd never hear it . He 's too far away . We 've got to think of something . What about Mr Smith ? Could he hear it ? Yes ! YES ! You are SO my sister ! Rani , the launch starts in an hour ! You look great . I 've done it ! 'WE have done it ! ' Whatever ! OK , we 're in ! Trevor and Janet Sharp . Trevor , do I look like a Trevor ? Although I am sharp . They 're journalists , from Twilight Years magazine , for the over 60s . Geriatric News ? Couldn 't you do better ? They 're the only ones on the list that won 't turn up . 'Mr And Mrs Sharp are stranded at Orly Airport , 'thanks to a ... computer malfunction . ' Mr and Mrs ? Yeah , and they 're , married . Right . Right . The cavalry 's coming , and it 's me and the missus . My old Dutch . Shut up Clyde . Come on ! 'Wait a moment ! I 'm picking up a high-frequency , modulated signal , 'in Morse code ! ' Brilliant ! 'The transmission is on the command frequency of K-9 . ' It must be Luke , the whistle ! Or it 's a trap . How do we know it 's Luke for sure ? 'Deciphering ... 'Message begins , Clani ... ' Yeah , that 's Luke ! 'Grab Harrison 's 'P-E-N . Full stop . ' Never been so glad to see a full stop . What does it mean ? What it says . Grab his pen ! Ready to go through with this ? I will help the little people . I 'm ready . I hope I am . It 's an oldie but a goodie . Go ! Help , help ! This crazy woman , she 's trying to kill me ! Help , please ! Help , please ! Well done ! Let 's go ! There must be no mistakes ! Everything at the launch must go exactly according to plan ! Yes , Master , yes , Master ! This time you are working for your lives ! Fail me and it 's level ten punish ! Master ? What do you want ? We thirst . We so thirsty . Oooh , dear Shall I give you all a drink ? No , Master ! Please , Master ! No ! Water burns , water burns ! You get the message ? WORK ! Luke ! Sky ! Come on ! Listen , I 've got a plan . But first we need to get that pen away from Harrison ! We 've got that covered . What ? How ? You 've got gifted kids . Hi . Can I just check that for you ? That 's lovely , thank you . Right , just in time . Where is he , where is Harrison ? He 's over there . He doesn 't look like much . And what 's his pen got to do with it ? There we go , top pocket . Ready , ready , ready ! Near time , near time ! This place is terrible . The smell ! But look ! They got the message ! Wow , you are gifted , aren 't you ? No , no ! Go , go , go ! It 's OK ! We 're going to help you ! No help ! Master punish ! Not for much longer . Leave it to Clyde and Rani ! What then ? Your gifted mum 's got that covered . Or she will have . Wait here ! Adriana , I need something from you . Right ! Here goes ! Hello , hello ! New faces , good to see you ! Keeps me young . Lionel Carson . Trevor . Call me Trev . Meet Janet , the trouble and strife . Trev , my old ball and chain . You 're from Twilight Years ? What ? New approach . We 're the voice of youth . We 're opinion formers ! We give a stairlift a five-star review , and watch the sales rocket ! Rocket in a very steady and safe way . Yeah , wouldn 't want to give our readers any big shocks ! There aren 't enough stars in the skies for the Serf Board ! Everyone will love it . I know you will . Escaped ? Well , then find her ! NOW ! Mr Harrison , isn 't it ? Janet Sharp , Twilight Years . Do you mind if I grab a quick word ? Mr Carson , could I borrow a pen ? Help yourself . Thank you . Send that message now , Mr Smith ! Urgent rescue flight needed ! Co-ordinates ... the roof of the Serf Systems compound . Yeah . 'Earth calling Skultos . Light Sculptors imprisoned . 'Dispatch rescue vehicle immediately , 'urgent , to these co-ordinates . ' That is amazing . Ooh , bum ! Pen 's run out , can I borrow yours ? Yes , here . Look , keep it . Thank you , I 've got to go , it 's almost time . Sorry , mate . Waste of time ! Three cheers for the old switcheroo . He did it ! Right ! They 're free ! Free ! Free , free ! Free , free ! Clyde 's got the pen ! Brilliant ! Plark ! Come , bring your people up to the roof , quickly . Rescue 's on its way ! Skultos . Home ! Come on , now ! Quick , follow us ! You two stay here and keep an eye on Harrison . But ... Mum 's right , Sky . See you soon ! Come on ! RUN ! Run , run , run ! Hi , I 'm Joseph Serf . I 'm here to introduce the Serf Board from Serf Systems , the world 's newest , and best , portable computer . The 15th at 5pm . A moment of history . But I don 't get it , it 's just a pen . Don 't play with it ! Mine , I think , Janet ! Enjoy the show . Get ready , Plark , the time is now ! 'Just one mistake and it 's double ten ! ' No ! He 's got the pen back ! If the hologram doesn 't obey , he 'll know something 's wrong ! He 'll hurt them , stop them getting away . We 've got to work Serf ! What ? Come on ! We 've got to drag the hologram ourselves . Come on , come on ! But they are free ? Almost , Adriana ! Almost ! So before we go through to meet the Serf Board , let 's meet the man behind the Serf Board . Joseph Serf ! Mr Joseph Serf ! Ready ? You bet ! Serf ! Now , now , now ! Left leg . Right leg . Left leg . Right leg . Walk ! WALK ! Fella 's been drinking . Welcome to my lovely lunch . My lovely launch . I AM gorgeous . He 'd never say that ! First thing I could think of ! You keep him talking ! What a beautiful day , boys and girls . Remember , he 's American ! As I woke up , put my grits on the griddle , I thought , " What a cotton-pickin ' day to launch a new computer ! " What ? What ? You 've been watching Toy Story again . He 's going to use the pen . No ! The pen ! Get the pen ! He 's hypnotic . We 've got to turn up the hypno-power . Listen , everybody . I want you to grab the pen from Harrison ! Grab the pen from him ! I say , that 's not on ! Leave her alone ! Smash it ! SMASH IT ! Smash it ! No ! No ! No ! It 's stopped . Go home ! The Serf Board is rubbish ! Bog standard ! Cobblers ! Garbage ! Go home . Tell everyone ! No ! Of course it is . Stupid computers . " Nothing wrong with a typewriter , " says I. It 's grade A , 100 % toot ! It 's bobbins . It 's trash . In fact , you think it 's rubbish , go home , tell everyone ! I 've got a weird feeling about him . Hi , Clani ! I knew it ! Go to the roof . Bye , Clani ! We did it ! Where 's Harrison ? Sarah Jane Smith ! Step away from them ! You 're too late . I said I 'd stop you ! You and whose army ? That army ! We go now . Thank you , thank you ! You good people ! I think that 's your ride ! Quick ! Come on ! No ! I paid billions ! No ! No ! You belong to me ! You 're mine , mine ! Yes ! That was a spaceship . What will they do to Harrison ? Set him to work , I hope . But it 's amazing , amazing ! Who 's this again ? I 'm just the cleaner . I mean I WAS the cleaner . I have no job now . So you people , you do this all the time ? That 's wonderful ! Give this lot a call . Mention my name . You 're just the kind of agent they need , put them back on track . And the pay will be very good , I 'll make sure of that . 'The Serf Board has failed to live up the hype , 'and Joseph Serf has disappeared . ' That 's enough , Mr Smith . Well , I 'm certainly not disappointed ! Poor Mr Serf . The real Mr Serf . Nobody will ever know what really happened to him . Done it . Sky , could you get that CD you promised me , please ? Sure . Won 't be a second . What are you two up to ? Nothing ! Sorry , Sarah Jane , it 's a family thing ! Hi , Sky ! What 's going on ... ? Present for you . I got Clyde to do it . For me ? It 's your room , isn 't it ? It 's great ! Nothing 's too good for my sister ! Come here . 'I 've seen amazing things out there in space ... ' .. but strange things can happen wherever you are . 'I 've learned that life on Earth can be an adventure too . ' Mum ? Luke ! 'In all the universe 'I never expected to find a family . ' Subtitles by Red Bee Media and APOLLO

 What happened up to now on : SPACE PILOT ... What 's this ? - Some kind of feedback ? The void-hole was back , dissolving the cosmos ! It 's bigger than I thought . I 'm outta here ! Who was gonna fire the cannon into the void-hole ! I had to find the professor . Mel ! The teleporter hole led to a foreign planet ! I 'm back home on my planet . That is totally impossible . That 's not Mel 's home . Dr. Spamy , you have to shoot the cannon into the void ! How sweet ... Ok . I admit it , I know exactly where this wormhole has led us . SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries What 's this ? APPEARANCE AND REALITY PART II Where are we ? Is this the other side of the void or are we in another galaxy ? Professor Tarantoga ! He must be here somewhere ! Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem Tarantoga ! This jackass ! Now I was sure what he said about the void-hole wasn 't true . We 're still alive , and there 's something here and not nothing , huh ? There must be another explanation for the hole in the cosmos . Here ! Come on ! - Where to ? We have to go back . - How ? Through that , huh ? I think ... this is the way we came ! We 're in Hell ! - Come on ! Get on the other one . Do it ! Do it ! Are you a scaredy-rat like this Tarantoga guy ? Hello ? Am I dead now ? Fly straight for once , you ugly trunk-hen ! I was shocked ! We were teensy-weensy ! And had been sucked into the vacuum cleaner ! In front of you ! Watch out ! Look ! We were never on a foreign planet . We were in your potted plant the whole time . That 's why the vegetation seemed so familiar ! The wormy hole had shrunk us . And how do we get big again ? Does it work backward ? You stupid appliance ! Catch me if you can , you miserable void ! Just you wait ! She can 't see us , we have to go back ... to the flowerpot , to the wormy hole ! Come on ! Catch me ! Let 's find the way to the wormy hole . We can get bigger through the teleporter and come back through the kitchen ! Oh no . - I don 't believe this . Hey , look here . Down here ! - Such a blind-bat ! Spamy , when are you gonna fire the cannon into the damn void ? Have Tarantoga or Tichy turned up yet ? Maybe she 's too stupid ! - Or we 're too small ! It was all over now . We were trapped shrunk in a flowerpot ... while the void hole was wiping out the universe . Hallucinette had to turn on the teleporter again . I had a brilliant idea ... of how to send her a sign . Come on ! You 're fat and ugly ! Oh crap ! It 's working . Mr. Tichy , he 's coming ! Left , left , left ! Right , right , right ! It 's working ! And the cannon ? You have two left hands ? Miroslav ... Enough now ! I have to put up with a lot from Mr. Tichy ... but you 're even worse . A complete failure . You really must be the biggest cosmic dumb-ass alive ! Compared to you Mr. Tichy 's a hero . I would 've bet all my fuses I 'd never say this ! Now we 'll see if she is a sly-fox , huh ? My stomach is rumbling again . I don 't understand the connection ! Me neither ! You know what you are ? A loser ! This whole time I was looking for my real home ... my family . But it was here all along ... right in front of my nose ! Hey , we 're here ... I 'm in charge ! What would Mr. Tichy do ? In a critical situation he would ... run away , that 's it ! We gotta get outta here ! How dare you ! An arrow ? Where did that come from ? Oh , the plug . My invention . A smart appliance ? I said so , didn 't I ? Yeah ... Let 's go ! You coming ? Oh no . Not again ... Mr. Tichy , at last ! What happened ? It 's getting bigger ! No one can fire the cannon ! Where 's the vacuum cleaner ? Tell me ! It so nice of you to want to tidy up now , but ... Tarantoga , you jackass . Are you in there ? Yes , I 'm here . Help ! Answer if you hear me ! He can 't hear me , oh no ! What an egghead ! - Yeah ... You have to go back in the flower pot , okay ? Such a show-off ! What 's with Mel ? - The Mel-fellow ? He 'll find his way back . Crap ! Again ! Hey , jackass-professor , huh ? - Careful now ! Go through the wormy hole to get to the kitchen . I 'm already on my way . Oh , my back ... Where am I now ? If that worm comes again ... Mel ? Not together ! My arm ! I have my arm back ! Where 's the Mel-fellow ? That was the solution . A worm hole . Through teleporter back coupling . I have my arm again . Where 's Mel ? What 's that ? What is the meaning of this ? - Ok , I 'll explain . This is ... Mel . He 's not from a foreign planet . He 's my dog . A watch dog , actually ... He came to the Institute through the teleporter with this earth on his feet . I was washing my dog 's paws , after our walk , and by mistake I teleported him ... together with my right arm . Stupid of me . I know . The result was a fusion between my dog and my arm . Mel ! This is Mel 's dog tag . Those two creatures came about in the same foolish way . Dr. Spamy wanted to send two eggs at once . Out of curiosity , he stuck his trunk in the teleporter . Idiot ! I kept looking for a technical solution to reverse this fusion . And now , at last , I have my arm back . What about Mel ? - Mel . Heel ! Mel , you flee-ridden mutt . Let 's go home . Be a little nicer to Mel . Watch out , Tzushy ! I 've got two arms now ! How about a black eye ? He deserved that ! Let 's do it ! No , no , I 'm right-handed ! At least let me keep my right hand ! On the other side of my kitchen ! My good arm ! - Home at last ... Why are you all looking at me like that ? Did something happen ? - No , no ... What 's wrong ? Why is no one dealing with the void ? I had the feeling that there was a direct connection ... between me and the hole in the cosmos ! Yes ! I 'll go and shoot my cannon . We need to bring about a new evolution ... Stop right there ! Up to now nothing you 've said has been true . Not the green planet ... not the Mel-fellow ... So why should it be any different with this void-hole ? I 'm going to find the solution to this puzzle ! I 'd let it go . There 's nothing on the other side ! Mel-fellow , can you take over the wheel ? It 's in good hands , all left up to me ! And you ... You rope me down ? If there are any problems ... it 's all in your own hands . The rope and Ijon Tichy ! Let 's go ! And then Ijon Tichy fell into the void ... and saw ... that this hole was just an empty place in the story . Because of my growling stomach , I couldn 't concentrate any more ... and had no ideas left . The empty part of the story grew bigger . What did you say ? That 's why the Star Diaries and the adventures of Ijon Tichy ... had to come to an end forever . The void-hole is just a hole in the universe ? Because your head is empty and you have no more ideas for the story ... because your stomach is hungry and grumbling . Yes . Are you as dumb as a doornail ? I 'm the cosmic hero Ijon Tichy ... and I 'll do ... as I please ! I 'm Ijon Tichy ! I type and you do what I type ? Nothing ! That 's not an ending for the Hero of the Cosmos . You 're on your own now ! I will not type you a happy ending into the story . I 'd rather make a yummy omelet . Do it ! No discussion ! Go ! It wasn 't nice of him to sell me for only two eggs . But if Hallucinette really wants to hang on to him ... Yes , but the professor wasn 't willing to give more than two eggs for you ! That 's irrelevant now . But I 'll make sure Tushy get 's that black eye I owe him ! Mr. Tichy , up here . It 's all weird ! What 's going on here ? Nothing important ! What are you doing ? I didn 't type that ! Dr. Spamy came and threw his arms around Hallucinette , sobbing his heart out ... making her drop the rope . - I think she likes me . Dr. Spamy , your weird trunk 's back ? Yes , through the teleporter . - I couldn 't have done this left handed ! Just like I said , Mr. Tichy , there 's nothing here . You are right again , Professor ! There 's nothing here . Hey , stop it now ! This is not possible ? I didn 't type any of this ! That ... is science fiction for you ! Anything 's possible . People later said ... that I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... Let 's get outta here . Just a second ... You are a loyal appliance ... and you were right : I need to respect your equal rights in the rocket . From now on ... I will no longer call you an " appliance " . I will call you " Miss Appliance " . Now , step on the gas , Miss Appliance ! Thank you , Tichy . I 'm still Mr. Tichy to you . And now , let 's go ! I 'll say it again . Nasty people said ... that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... but on long space voyages lost all inhibitions ... And that Tushy , I told him there was nothing there ! Professor ? Since when do I have two left hands ? That I 'll save that story for later . Oh no ! Finally , a yummy omelet .

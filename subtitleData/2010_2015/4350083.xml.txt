 [ Wedeck ] On October 6 , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . [ Wedeck ] We believe that this man was somehow connected to the blackout . [ Janis ] He 's highly efficient in advanced computing equipment . He also seems to have a penchant for chess . The man you call D. Gibbons , his real name is Dyson Frost . Hello , Demetri . My name is Dyson Frost . Got your attention , didn 't I ? In my flash forward , I saw this symbol . I remember the images , but I just can 't put them together . [ Nicole ] You have to find her . Our entire investigation hinges on what 's in your head . I 'm here to make sure you don 't lose it before April 29th . - We went to Utah . - Officer down ! D. Gibbons knew we were coming . You unearthed the Somalia photos . Five minutes later , we 're getting shot at . Whoever we 're investigating knows what we 're doing before we do it . We have a mole . You 're forgetting there 's another part to what we saw where we 're not together . Hey , honey . I want to go away with you and with Charlie . I just want to get away from all of this . Yes or no ? Thanks . Hey , I 'm sorry . I was in surgery . - Oh , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Oh , God . What happened ? Um ... I ran into a bullet . Babe , I 'm serious . Six inches this way , this bullet 's in your heart . I know . I 'm not sure I can handle this anymore . [ Sighing ] Livy , I was an FBI agent when you married me . But it is different now . We have a daughter . I mean , if something happens to you , I ... - I don 't wanna ... - [ sighing ] Look , I get that this is who you are . But it 's different . I mean , I 've got to know that our family comes first . Something 's gotta change . Wedeck offered me a position on the DHS Counterterrorism Task Force . - It 's an improvement ? - Uh ... It 's surveillance . Two guys in a car eating burritos , listening to phone calls in Farsi . I 'll be out of the line of fire . My biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol . You 're gonna hate that . Hmm . But I can take it . What I can 't take is losing you and Charlie . Our family will always come first . I promise . So , um , if you need anything I 'll be staying at the Wedecks ' . I 'm sorry . I have no idea how to do this . Neither do I. [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Olivia ] She 's been in there 20 minutes . I 'll call you tonight . [ Sighing ] Are you my new partner ? If you are , I insist you change clothes . Can 't catch bad guys in pajamas . Where are you going ? I 'm just going to the Wedecks' for a little while . How long is a little while ? Well , I ... hope it 's not very long at all . - [ Mark ] What 's this ? - You lost your bracelet . It 'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home . Let me put it back on . Come here . I love you so much , Charlie Bear . [ Dyson ] If you 're watching this message in 2010 , that means the global blackout was successful . That also means we 've had a near miss in Pigeon , Utah . How do I know all this ? Because I myself have had hundreds of flash forwards . In nearly all of my futures , I end up dying on March 15th , like you , Demetri . So if you managed to find this tape in Somalia , it would seem our fates are on a collision course , and the possible outcomes of the game are rapidly narrowing . As for the endgame , the next move is Mark Benford 's . That 's Dyson Frost ? And it 's genuine ? Yeah . It 's legit . Degradation rate in the magnetic tape plus the date of production makes it authentic . The only explanation , however implausible , is that Frost flashed forward from 1991 to our present and saw us in Somalia . Then in 1991 , he makes a tape he knows we 'd find . That 's a 19-year flash forward . And March 15th , the day he dies in his future ... Is the date I 'm supposed to be murdered . Maybe that 's the collision course he 's talking about . Dem , Frost talks about narrowing outcomes , another indication that what people see in their flash forwards are only possibilities . - Could be warning us . - Warning us about what ? There 's gonna be another blackout . What ? How ? When ? We have to assume that 's Agent Benford 's next move , to find out and to prevent it . So let 's make it a good one . Find Dyson Frost ... yesterday . This is magnificent work . Master circuits built from basic sketches I designed when I was 13 . When you finish patting yourself on the back , can we work ? I had a lot of trouble to get this , not to mention that basement . Yes , I know , the missing digit . A terrible loss . You find anything in those documents we got in Somalia ? Yeah , a couple of things . [ Lloyd ] There were several references to tachyonic dark matter . In ' 91 ? How is that possible ? Well , the theoretical basis existed . - But the experiment failed . - Because they needed us . Well , clearly , you 're missing the silver lining . The blackout ... we 're off the hook . Not our fault . Frost flash forwarded in ' 91 using technology that we did not develop . Simon , Flosso said our NLAP experiments amplified the blackout . We can 't dodge that . - Find anything else interesting ? - I saw this formula in my flash forward written on a mirror . It 's the exact inverse of some of our early NLAP computations . I don 't know , maybe a process to reverse the blackout ? You 're working on blackout protection in your flash forward ? I don 't know , but it was this formula , and there was more written on the mirror , and the two of them are combined somehow . Well , we need the other formula that you saw on the Benfords ' mirror . Go see your girlfriend . Tick tock . Nothing . I ran face recognition software on every available database . Since Frost faked his death in 1990 , there is not one record , not one sighting of this guy . Nothing . He 's a thorough guy , likes complex things like chess . He 's also arrogant , likes people to know he 's winning . I 've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre - ' 90 . Frost placed third in an amateur league in ' 87 , and the guy he beat lives in San Francisco . His name is lan McKinnon . McKinnon was the reigning champion until Frost beat him in an upset . So I traced him and then I gave him a call . But when I mentioned Frost , he hung up . Well , let 's travel . We need to get to San Francisco and talk to him , right ? Yeah . But first , there 's something else . This is Frost 's final tournament against McKinnon . He uses a very risky play called the Queen Sacrifice . Looks like a Hail Mary , but it 's one of the most effective plays in the game . - OK , so what ? - He knew we would see these games . It 's another message from 1991 . [ Mark ] Tournament game sheets . Each of his moves takes either two or four seconds , never more , never less . In the three games , he made 50 moves , after which he resigned . So this is a code of some kind . Wait . Is this ... This is Morse code . Two second moves are dots . Four second moves are dashes . There are 50 moves , so 50 characters . And this is just jumbles of letters here . Not letters . Numbers in Morse code have five dots or dashes . Fifty divided by five is ten ... ten digits . Is it a phone number ? [ Mark ] Prepaid cell . He really did know the future . [ Ringing ] - [ Dyson ] Well done . Leave a message . - [ beeping ] Dyson Frost ? This is Agent Benford . It 's your move . Now we 're traveling . [ Soft atmospheric music playing ] [ Bell jingling ] [ Speaking Japanese ] In English , please . I know you like halibut . Some just came in this morning . No , thank you . I ate ... some cereal . That 's not enough . You need protein . [ Chuckling ] You are kind , but I can 't . It 's ... too much money . [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] I want a ... new beginning . And new love . [ Speaking Japanese ] - Some miso soup ? A little rice ? - [ Chuckling ] OK . - OK . - [ Bell jingling ] Not today . [ Sighing ] [ Nicole ] Come here often ? I 'm beginning to feel like a regular . Don 't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward ? Bryce , you 're my friend . You 're crazy if you think I 'm gonna let you go through this alone . I appreciate what you 're doing , but I don 't want you to see me like this . - Is this about your pride ? - A little bit , yeah . Hello , it 's me . You 've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother . I think we 've both seen behind the curtain . Besides , the chemo 's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours . So tonight let 's have some fun . OK , let 's do it . But I 'm buying dinner . [ Indistinct police chatter ] - [ Demetri ] You call SFPD ? - [ Mark ] What do you think ? [ Man ] Right behind you . - Help you guys ? - Special Agent Benford . Agent Noh . Detective John Smith . Yes , that 's my real name . - What do you need ? - What happened here ? Some guy from the chess club took two in the back of the head . Don 't tell me , lan McKinnon ? Yeah , lan McKinnon . Person of interest ? [ Sirens wailing in distance ] Not anymore . Lan McKinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the ' 80s , and now he 's dead . He was our best lead on Frost , but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation . San Francisco Bureau is handling the follow-up , but I 'm not expecting much . How long between when you first made contact and time of death ? Eight hours , tops . There 's only one conclusion . The leak we 've been tracking that 's compromised the security of the whole Mosaic investigation is inside the Bureau . Not just the Bureau . No . Inside our office . [ Sighing ] I 've been ordered to give full agency support , fresh pair of eyes , all the rest of that crap . You got a play ? My dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing . He 'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water , watch the fish float to the top . It was ugly , but it worked . Game on . Just don 't forget who your friends are . What 's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy . I need you to step away from your desk . What the hell is going on ? Everyone 's required to assemble in the conference room , sir . - On whose authorization ? - Sorry , Assistant Director Wedeck . - Orders . - Whose orders ? I 'm not at liberty to say . That 's not part of the Task Force agreement . [ Clearing throat ] No calls , and I 'll need your cell phone , please . - Don 't touch me . - Sir , your phone . What 's going on ? Someone lose their keys ? Simon Campos ? - Yeah ? - You 're in there also , sir . I 'm not really an employee . I 'm more of a visitor . What is this ? I 've not had my coffee . [ Electronic buzzing ] [ Beeping ] What 's this about ? Judging from the way our offices are being torn apart , I 'd say an Interagency Task Force has been formed and is looking for a leak . We can 't just look for the leak on our own ? [ Janis ] Yeah . I think the point is , one of us is a mole . And Mark ? Apparently already vetted . [ Steady beeping ] This office has been swept . [ Beeping faster ] Tweezers . [ Keys clicking ] [ Hollow noise ] There 's your leak . Get out . It 's voice-activated . When your office is swept for bugs at 4am , the sweepers don 't make any sound . No sound , no transmission . You 've vetted the sweepers ? Since the blackout , all techs have been agency-contracted , blind assignments . That 's how you do security . They just don 't know about the singing . So who has access to your office , Mark ? [ Mark ] Everyone in that room . Time to light the fuse . Ladies and gentlemen , as you may have deduced , we 're closing in on a leak inside the FBI that is hampering the Mosaic investigation . Now ... anyone want to confess ? No ? Then it 's the hard road . You 'll be first , Agent Noh , as you were part of the failed attempt to contact lan McKinnon . - You got anything to say about this ? - We have to do this . Vogel , you 're a son of a bitch . You know that ? True as that may be , I 'm working with Agent Benford today . I was with you the whole time in San Francisco . - I don 't think you 're the mole . - Who then ? Someone in that room . If you don 't think I 'm the mole , what am I doing here ? I need the mole to think I suspect everyone , even you . - How long are we gonna be in here ? - Good question . They 've got their whole procedure to go through : Re-vet contact histories , - Bureau records , computers . - That could take days . They 're gonna vet our personal files . Not if they don 't have passwords . - You didn 't give up your passwords ? - Not to my personal files , no . Something on your computer you don 't want people to see ? No , I mean , nothing that 's ... sensitive . You know , I 'm clean . It 's porn . Agent Curdy , downloading naked cheerleaders on FBI time ? [ Stammering ] It 's nothing like that . It 's ... It 's , um ... It 's just ... it 's an RPG . - Oh . - What ? It 's an RPG , it 's a role-playing game . I play Warlocks of Avalon online . I 'm a seventh level druid . My name is Argothic . - [ All snickering ] - You have any special powers ? Um , cape of invisibility , lightning hammer , elixir of life , healing . - That 's impressive . - Yeah , it 's cool . - You 're next . Vreede . - Can I borrow that cape ? Any reason we can 't get back to work , do something useful ? Vogel found a microtransmitter in that key . You want to be useful ? Tell me who put that in my office . - You think it was one of us ? - That 's the working theory . " M " ... for " Mark . " Nice touch . Unless it was you , Marcie . Can you shut up for five minutes ? - Want some sugar ? - I don 't use sugar . Mark ? We 're with you . You know that . Thanks . But we 're close . We 'll get him . Good thing the fate of the planet doesn 't rely on Mark Benford finding the mole . [ Rap music playing ] - [ music continues ] - [ Indistinct chattering ] [ Muffled ] Son of a bitch ! Excuse me ! Koreatown 's further west . No . I 'm not Korean . I 'm Japanese . Either way , you gotta get on the bus . [ Music , chatter continuing ] - You want this car to do that ? - That 's the idea . I look ? You look ? You look like you don 't belong here , and you definitely don 't belong under the car . Hydraulics or nitrogen air bags ? Hydraulics . Could be fracture in cylinder . I can help . Maybe I surprise you , yes ? OK , Ninja Girl . But if you break my axle , I 'm coming after you . Hm-hm . Thank you . [ Tools whirring ] This is really screwing with my trust issues . You know that ? [ Mark ] Yeah , you 've been through a lot , Janis . I took a bullet , Mark . And I 'm seriously a suspect ? You have to admit that getting shot and living makes for a perfect cover . Screw you , Vogel . I 'm sure there 's a reason , but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks in the weeks since the blackout , 13 in all . - So ? - In three previous years at the Bureau , you 've taken precisely ... two . Mark , you know what I saw in my flash forward . I 've been going to a fertility clinic . Yeah . You only had eight visits . - We checked . - So what ? So I went out to ... go buy some shoes . - Come on , Mark . - Where were you ? Hm ? What is it , Janis ? Ever since the shooting , I 've been looking at everyone differently suspicious . Just checking up . - And you found something ? - Does he have to be here for this ? Marcie has a brother . - We know about him . - There 's another one a half brother . He 's very sick . He 's dying in Missouri in a full care facility . It 's expensive . Marcie didn 't name him in any of her applications . Those absences ... I went off-site to look into some things . You never mentioned this before . - I was waiting . - For what ? I was waiting to see if she did something . And Marcie 's paying for this care ? There was a deposit made to an account for $ 50,000 three months ago anonymous . OK , Janis . Thanks . I don 't know anything for sure . I 'm just trying to help . - You 've done the right thing . - It doesn 't feel like it . You trust her ? You know what , Vogel ? Being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore . - [ Charlie ] It 's gonna rain . - [ Olivia ] Yep , but we 're together . We 're having a girls ' day . I don 't want to have a girls ' day . I want Daddy to be here . - Daddy wants to be here , too . - Then why isn 't he ? Here 's the thing , sweetie . Daddy and I love each other very much . But most of all , we love you . And we 're always gonna be a family . That 's never gonna change . I promise . Come on . Let 's go for a ride . - Yeah ? Let 's do it . - OK . - Can I ride the Ferris wheel ? - You want to go on the Ferris wheel ? Uh-huh ! Hey . So I went through Marcie 's background . She did declare her brother in her initial application . But Janis said she didn 't . The original vetting records were at a regional field office . When they were routed to DC , an entirely separate file was created . It was easy to miss , man . - You OK ? - Yeah . No . No . [ Door closing ] I moved out of the house . Yeah . [ sighing ] Olivia and me , we 're ... I don 't know . I moved out . Sorry . Is this about what you saw in your flash forward ? Hm-hm . Partly that , partly what she saw . - Is there anything I can do ? - No . But Marcie 's still a suspect , so keep digging . All right . [ Door opening , closing ] [ Indistinct chatter , laughter ] [ Machine ] Tell your future . [ Indistinct yelling , giggling ] [ Machine ] Step up and I in your future ... - Can we do that again ? - No , my love . Let 's go . Let 's go . - OK , let 's go . - Can we go again ? Can we go again ? No , sweetie . [ Riders screaming ] Why are you following us ? Because it 's my job . I 'm Special Agent Danforth Crowley . Your husband assigned me to be your security detail . Your safety is his number one priority . [ Rap music playing ] [ Tools whirring ] You don 't know much English , so I know you don 't have a work visa . I can try to get you paid off the books . That 's your first job . Client wants more horsepower , so we 've been trying to remap the ECU . My guys only work on carbureted engines , so for them it 's like ... Japanese . [ Chuckling ] German . You said you were some big-time engineer back in Japan . Maybe you can figure this out . Yes . It is no problem . Yo , Emil . You didn 't tell us you were hiring a masseuse . [ Laughter ] Listen up . Cut the music . I got something to say . [ Music stops ] This is Keiko . She works here now . That means she 's part of the family . Treat her with respect , or we 're gonna have a problem . Everyone get that ? I 'll take that as a yes . - [ Tools whirring ] - [ rap music resumes ] All right . Get to work . Hey , it 's me . I just wanted to thank you for that security detail . It scared the hell out of me , but I guess it helps . Charlie misses you . Um ... Anyway , I 'm at the hospital , so call me if you ... Olivia ? We need to talk . I swear I wouldn 't bother you if it wasn 't absolutely necessary . You literally have the world 's worst timing . Well , yeah . I 've heard that before . What do you want , Lloyd ? OK , I need to know exactly what you saw in your flash forward . I wrote a formula on your bedroom mirror , and I think it relates to the global blackout , but what I saw was incomplete . Did you see it ? Yes , I did . Part of it . I have to make a call . [ Olivia ] After a while , I got up from bed . Then I noticed something was written on the mirror . It was written in lipstick . Most of it was indecipherable , but I did recognize this . [ Olivia ] Halothane . It 's an anesthetic . Quantum physics and anesthetics ... That 's what Mark and I were working on in our flash forward . I thought QED meant quantum electrodynamics . But we were ... building a quantum entanglement device . Good . Well , that clears that up . - I have to be getting on with rounds . - Yes , of course . [ Stammering ] I don 't want you to think I 'm harassing you . No , I know . You 're just trying to save the world . Good-bye . [ Emil ] So you come here every single night just in case this guy shows up ? And during the daytime . [ Chuckling ] I know . I know . But it 's the only way I can find him . All right . I respect that . You saw your fate , and now you 're doing your thing . When I saw my future , it was the best day of my life . It was the first day I let myself want what was in my heart . So like you say , I am doing my thing . [ Chuckling ] Can I ask , what did you see ? Something different than you . Let 's leave it at that . [ Chuckling ] You are kind to give me a job . [ Sighing ] - We 're lucky to have you . - Thank you . You ever tried sea urchin ? No . Is it good ? It 's like eating somebody 's thyroid . Well , I 'm sure Keiko loves it . And if she 's the woman you were in love with in your vision , - you have to eat it with her . - Wait . This could be a problem . What if sushi 's her favorite food , and that 's all she ever wants to eat ? OK . Suddenly she 's a Mogwai . You 're being ridiculous . A what ? - Never mind . - Wait . What 's a Mogwai ? I 'm not explaining it to you . Justify your metaphor , young lady . [ Sighing ] God . Mogwai ... Gizmo , the little furry creatures that turn into gremlins if you don 't feed ' em right . They had dietary restrictions ... forget it . - Wow . - I know . It 's a very nerdy metaphor . - Just shut up and read the menu . - OK . I don 't know . - I 'm just not feeling sushi tonight . - Well , I am . OK . I guess I can have teriyaki . You 're kind of a spoiled brat . I never noticed that about you before . How dare you ? I have cancer . All right . What do you want to do ? - Bryce . - I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I just did that . [ Stammering ] I know why I did that , but ... It 's ... you 're thinking about another woman . You know , you can 't just kiss me in Little Tokyo , no less . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . It 's just you 're great . Honest mistake . Hey , just buy me a burger , and we 'll call it even . Deal . [ Indistinct ] [ Rap music playing ] - Good morning , Keiko . - Morning . - Too much sake ? - Hmm . Next time we have tequila . - How 's it going ? - This car will go very fast . You know , we just need a little more horsepower . We 're not trying to launch it into space . - [ Man ] Immigration ! - ICE ! Nobody move ! - Hands behind your heads ! - Just do what I do . Hands behind your head ! [ Indistinct yelling ] [ Man ] Move it ! Put your hands up now ! - Now ! Do it now ! - Don 't move ! You Emil Gutierrez ? You 're under arrest for employment of undocumented workers . - What 's your name ? - Keiko . Do you have an l-9 ? L-9 ? Surprise , surprise . All right . Load ' em into the van . Let 's go . [ Siren wailing ] [ Beeping ] Hey , it 's me . Listen , I had a great time last night ... And I 'm sorry about kissing you . Um ... You know , actually , I 'm not . I 'm glad . So ... - OK , well , anyway ... bye . - [ Sirens wailing ] They 've been in there 36 hours . Got anything ? All of Marcie 's background has been gone through by Vogel 's people already . Financials , phone records , background checks up the wazoo . I 'm doing surveillance tagging right now . This surveillance tech is good . Wait . Go back . Go back there . [ Computer beeping ] How many times does she have coffee ? [ Demetri ] She has coffee most of the time . Why ? She doesn 't use sugar . OK . Give me time stamps for every time she put sugar in her coffee . [ Beeping ] Each of these time stamps corresponds to a day a key piece of information was leaked . [ Beeping ] Look at that . No one knew about the Pigeon , Utah , trip ... Crap ! Or the Somali intel that triggered the attack in Washington . Every time she put sugar in her coffee , she was signaling her handlers . [ People screaming ] Marcie , what are you doing ? [ Man ] Down ! Everybody down ! - Down , down , down ! - Get down ! - Go ! - Cut her off at the stairs ! Go , go , go ! [ Tires squealing ] Down , down , down ! Down ! Down ! [ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] Hold fire , hold fire . [ Janis grunting ] Marcie . - [ Grunting , panting ] - Get her out of here . [ Sirens wailing ] - It looks like you were right , Janis . - I wish I wasn 't . [ Panting ] You could have let me in on it . I couldn 't say anything . Orders . - You told Demetri . - It was discretionary . I needed people in that room . So I was manipulated for the greater good . Queen Sacrifice , Frost 's play . - How 'd you know about that ? - We all have our ways , Mark . [ Phone ringing ] - Benford . - [ Dyson ] Agent Benford . Dyson Frost . Don 't speak . Just listen . I haven 't come forward since all your leads end up dead . But now that your mole problem has been fixed , I look forward to meeting you . I 'll be in touch . You were quite the hero today . I like a woman who knows how to handle a firearm . Fancy a drink ? I 'm not really your type . I think you 'd be surprised to learn exactly what my type is . I reviewed your Uncle Teddy 's autopsy X-rays . The CPR you gave him was quite aggressive . Could have even been the cause of his death . Yeah , I can be quite a tiger . You murdered him to send a message . Message received . I should have known . A double plant . Two moles , in case one is caught . Brilliant . And not one person in the office would suspect it 's you . Not one . Well , that would be the point , now wouldn 't it ?

Where were you before you were talking to me ? - It was an explosion . - Coming from where ? Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage , Captain . Do you have a visual signal ? Who are you ? You already have that information that , Captain . - I do ? - Recall my name ? We 'll rebuild the pattern Try to focus . I ... was on a mission . I was flying and ... Then I woke up on the train ... Now I 'm here . I need to be briefed . Um .. W .. What unit is this ? - You 're with Beleaguered Castle . - Who ? Standby please , while I read one of our memory pattern W ..

What ? This looks so real . You know I think it 's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible . - Unbelievable detail . - Ticket ! Can I see your ticket ? You 're the doer in front of me . - A doer ? - You 're the pretty girl . - Ticket . - The distraction . - Distraction ? - Every " sim " has one . - Are we gonna make up the 10 mintues ? - We are gonna try . - Are you talking about Bryan - Hey , Grandpa ...

He came in third on America 's Got Talent He got arrest twice for DUI . - We talked about him - Thank you , Ma 'am , thank you . You 're welcome . At one o 'clock , the bridge will be blocked . - Damn it ! - Sorry . Let me get it . Hey , mister ... hey ! Hey ! You dropped this . Thanks . All aboard , doors are closing . The explosion came from behind me . - Whats with you ? - Don 't have time to talk to you right now . I got time for you . Next stop ... Chicago , Union station . Oh , god ! Goodwin You gonna tell me how to disarm this ? Should I ... unplug it or do you want me to just leave it ... Okay ... I 'm just gonna leave it . Okay ? Ladies and gentlemen , Transit security Due to security breach I need all of you to turn off your personal electronic devices til we pull into the next station . Okay ? That means , laptops , cellphones ... cellphone , sir . - cellphone , sir , Thank you very much , pagers , - anything electronic . It 's just a precautionary measure , nothing to worry about . So which is it ? Security breach or precautionary measure ? Sir ? Is there a problem here , sir ? - I 'm in the middle of a very good deal . - Sean ? - I need you to that off - Why don 't you show me your ID again . - Sean . - Turn it off . Turn it off What is your problem ? Asshole Sean , what 're you doing ! Not a good idea , ma 'am . That 's Not a good idea . I think you broke his jaw . It 's okay , he 's not anymore real than you are . I 'm not real ? How about next time you drive to work ? I 'm not gonna be a next time . Stabilize ... Lower your pulse . Did you find the bomb ? Yes ! Theres hydraulic fluid all over the floor That is not a concern , Captain . What can you tell me about the bomb . Where 's that man . I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor . Looks like he 's in charge . I want to talk to him . That 's irrelevant , Captain . I wanna talk to your commanding officer ! You can talk to him upon completion of your mission . My mission is in Afghanistan . Where my unit is . I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday . You 've been with us for two months . Did you ID the bomber ? No . Where 's my unit ? And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation ? Captain , this is not simulation . Lives are depending on you . What lives ? What do you remember about the bomb ? Tell me about the detonator . No , what lives , what are you talking about ! ? I need to be briefed Sir , I need to give him something . That 's fine , go ahead . Get ready to send him back in . At 7.48 this morning ... Central standard time A bomb exploded on a commuter train outside Chicago killing everyone onboard . And that 's the train you 've been on No , I 'm here . You talking to me right now . A man named Sean Fentress was on that train . He for all intents and purposes is now you Every second spent , explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk This makes no sense . The train explosion was the first attack of the series they are going to perform Now , did you find the bomb ? In the restroom , ventilation panel above the sink . Cell phone detonator . - Are we done ? ! - Ah , No , no . But that 's good , It 's very , very good , Captain . Good All the records show that were 1812 calls ... ended at the moment of the explosion . 52 of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train . But one of , those calls was made by our bomber . Do you remember a freight train passing by , just before the explosion ? - Yes . - The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train , which means the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made . 52 callers , one of those is our bomber . I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car , Get to know them , narrow the suspects , look for ones who seem ... quiet or withdrawn , who seem nervous - As always , you have eight minutes . - 8 minutes , and then I blow up again . Yes . I need you to discipline yourself , on this next pass Perform only the tasks that we assign you Everything else is irrelevant . Charging drivers . Has my father ... I took your advice . It was very good advice . - You 're quiet today . - I got alot on my mind . Be careful . - So sorry - Don 't worry about it That was very kind of you . You 're very ... decent . Thank you . - Your real . - Ticket . - How 's everything going ? - It 's good - Anything out of the ordinary ? - No . I meant behaviour on the train Is anything ... anybody seem strange to you ? You 're a little strange . - How about you , does anybody look suspicious ? - Are you drunk or something ? Come here . Come here for a second . Come on . - Think of it as a game . - A game ? They 're all so utterly normal Sean , that 's what so terrifying about them . Maybe there 's team network . The sleeping giant , with Mr. mysterious there . Don 't forget the sullen college kid . He 's the expendable one . But they 're all controlled by the conductor ... Standing there all dictatorial , demanding tickets . - You 're funny . - Damn it . - What about that guy ? - Deposition . - What about the woman 's sitting across from him ? Hair appointment every monday You know this , you talk to these people , more than I do . Right , right , The guy behind her he 's late for an audition , right ? - He was arrested twice for ... - Driving under the influence of alcohol . - Hey , how 's the signal in here ? - Good . Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore , Sean ? Uh oh , That man slipped right through the racial profile . Did anyone else come out of that bathroom ? - Well , I saw you coming out of there . - Me ? - Yes . - No . Newark Station , next stop . Me ? Hey , mister ... Hey ! Hold on , Hold on Just hold on one second here It must be somewhere in here . A broken phone ... What is this ? - Christina ? - Yeah ? Excuse me . Newark Station . - Hey , hey , come with me . - This isn 't our stop . - No , come on , let 's take a walk . - We don 't get off here . I know , let 's just be spontaneous . You 're freaking me out ... I know this gonna sound really weird , but I have a bad feeling about this train and I think we should get off , okay ? - Just get your stuff . All aboard , doors are closing . Come on , Come with me . - So what now ? - Wait for me right here , I 'll be right back . Hey , ready to get that coffee now ? Sorry yeah . I just , just one more second , okay ? For God 's sake ... Feel sick ? Motion sickness , I get it all the time . Excuse me . - Are you following me ? - Can I borrow your phone ? No , I don 't have one - You sure ? - Yeah , I 'm sure . Why don 't you leave me alone please , or I 'll call the police . With what , I thought you said you didn 't have phone . You know , you have no right . What are you doing ? Give me the bag ! Where is it ? - Sean ? - Get back ! What are you doing ? Sean , whats going on ? Sean ! Stop ! It wasn 't you ... What the hell is wrong with you ? Are you insane ? No ! No ! No ! - Where 's the phone ? - Get away ! - Where is it ? - Get off me ! - Sean , get up ! - Shit . - Sean listens to me , get up ! - Get up ! - Sean - Give me your hand , get off the track ! Come on ! Goodwin ? Goodwin come in , do you read me ? Captain Stevens , this is Beleaguered Castle . Do you copy ? Please respond . It 's freezing here , whats goin on ? What was that ? He 's in trouble . I think the oxygen just went out . Goodwin Find a way to get through to him . What is it ? What 's goin on ? It 's not a issue with the cooling either . Just keep sending it , see if he hooks on to something . It 's hard to say exactly what he 's going thru . - Sir ... - Please ! theres not a whole lot we can do from here . If nothing changes , How much time does he have ? Some ... Not alot . Lily awoke in evening dress and opera cloak . In her hand , were five playing cards . They were the Queen of Spades , 4 of clubs ... Goodwin , you out there ? Goodwin , where 's Goodwin This is Captain Stevens Do you copy ? - Captain Stevens ? - The capsule lost power . Capsule ? Is that where you are right now , the capsule ? - You should know ... Who are you ? - Let me get captain Goodwin . - You invented this thing , right ? - I did . - Are you in command herel ? - I am . Were you able to locate the information we need , captain ? Thats a negative , sir , I was unable to find the bomber . But I did save a passenger on the train I got her off safely , a woman . Captain , it is gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train there outside the mission . Well , but she survived , I maybe rescued two . She survived , but only inside the source code none of them can be saved . What is the Source Code ? Quantum mechanics parabolic calculus it 's ... very complicated . Try me . Fine When the light truned off , there is an afterglow , a lingering halo effect , you seen it ? - Yes . - Of course . The brain is like that it 's electromagnetic field remains charged just briefly even after death . Circuits remain open . Now theres another peculiarity about the brain It contains a short-term memory track , thats approximately 8 minutes long . Like a convenience store security camera , that only records the last portion of the days activities on it 's hard drive . Combining these two phenomena circuitry that remains viable post mortem and memory bank that goes back of 8 minutes Source code enables us to capatilize on the overlap . Sean Fentress died on that train . Of all the passengers aboard he was your best link . You two share the compatibilty in terms of gender , body size and synaptic maps . What happens after the 8 minutes ? After ? Nothing . You cease to exist on the train . You can not exist inside the Source code beyond Fentress 's 8 minutes . Source code is not time travel . Rather source code is time reassignment . It gives us access to a parallel reality . Now the deaths on that train were a tragedy but Source Code empowers us ... But I saved one person , that girl that is always sitting across from me . I pulled her off the train . Give me her name . Christina ... I don 't remember her last name . - Her name was Christina Warren . - Yes . - She was 28 . - That 's her ! Born in Illinois , died this morning on the train . No , I pulled her off , she 's fine - No , she isn 't - Believe me , she is ! - Believe me ... - She saw me get hit by the Express train . - This isn 't geting us anywhere . - No , no , wait ... You have to him send him in , a second attack is imminent , Dr Rutledge . - What second attack ? - The train was just the beginning ... - Letter of intent . - What are you telling me here ? We have information that downtown Chicago , is the next target , and they are planning to detonate a dirty bomb . Do you have any idea how many people will die if an explosion at at that magnitude will occur in the city ? we 're evacuating as we speak . We have to stop it before it happens , do you understood ? If you find the bomber , the second attack the real attack we think can be prevented . We have very little time left , out here the clocks only move one direction . Charge the drivers . On the upper deck of the next carriage There is a conductor 's compartment . It 's a small office containing a strongbox , inside is a loaded hand gun . Get to it , you are authorised to use whatever force necessary . I took your advice ... It was very good advice . - You 're still here . - Of course I am . Guess what . You quit your job and now you enrolled in a LSAC course . - Good guess . - Soda can , coffee spill . Listen to me , don 't answer this . You deserve better than that guy Everything looks more beautiful in retro-spect , doesn 't it ? - Ticket . - How did you know ... How well do you know me ? - Not that well apparently . Do you know me well enough that if i did something that looked a little strange , maybe and maybe even a bit dangerous and I told you to trust me anyways , could you do that ? No . Wow , that was honest . You are beautiful , your kind and your painfully honest . Who are you and what did you do with Sean Fentress ? It 's the new me . I do not want to hurt you . No , I 'm not gonna sit in my seat . Alright , he 's bleeding , needs medical attention . It is true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train security box ? Be careful , ma 'am . - Damn it ! - What are you thinking ? - Can I borrow your phone ? - No , you need to go to the hospital . - Please , please let me borrow your phone . - No ! Why you want my phone ? What would you do if I only have a minute left to live ? I don 't know ... I would call my dad . I would hear his voice .. I 'd tell him I was sorry . Tell me everythings gonna be ok . Everythings gonna be ok . Gun from the strongbox , that was a great idea , Thanks for that . - Have you made any progress ? - Can I get access to a phone ? I need to talk to my father . I will try to work on that . Soon.Yes I will try . Goodwin , how am I doing ? I 'm just trying to measure my performance here . We 're losing precious time here . No , I have never been on the other side of the source code mission . I won 't be a viable candidate . Why not ? CAOC what is that ? Because the specifications are extremely narrow . - What are they ? - Captain , you should 've found the suspect by now . This tactical advantage , this tremendous tool we 've given you , Don 't squander it thinking , do . Please contact my father for me . This will stop at some point , Captain . As soon as you finish the mission . You 're doing really great . This will end . Whoever planted the bomb , had to have equipment of some kind . Gloves , a screwdriver to get into the overhead fans , flashlight , something ... Check bags , Backpacks , briefcases , anything . So I took your advice . - It was good very advice . - Grandpa ... - What are you doing ? - Trying to remember something . - What is that ? - A military patch . Were you in the military ? A friend of mine was . He was in Afghanistan , he disappeared and no one 's heard from him since . Do you have the internet on your phone ? No , it 's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string . - Do you think if you can see what you can find on this guy ? - Sure . It 's just been on my mind alot lately , His name is Captain Colter Stevens . - He 's in the 17th airborne . - Okay . - You owe me . - I 'll buy you a cup of coffee . Why don 't I get one for you now . Christina ... Um , I 've been having these dreams lately ... Really vivid . - And you 've been in them . - Really ? No , no not like that , not that I wouldn 't it 's just ... I 'll call you back in a minute , alright ? - Cramming ? - Yeah . For what ? Psyc , I have a big test this morning , so I should get back to it . Can I borrow a pen ? Yeah sure . Whoa that 's not cool , man ... - The bag is a mess . - What are you doing man ? Can not find what you 're looking just like my bag . - How bout you let the man have his bag back ? - Finish your deal , stay out of this tough guy , It doen 't end well for you . - That guy ... - You can 't do that . What am I doing ? Jesus ! - Dick . - CAOC-N ... Asshole . Excuse me ma 'am , Hey , how you doing . - You work at Walter Reed ? - Yeah I use to . I 'm in the military . - In the military ? - Yeah , yeah . What was goin on down there ? Oh you know , we were just having bit of an argument about this patch . - Is that what they train you to do , assualt civilians ? - please , Do any of theses letters they look familiar to you ? Do you know what the N stands for ? It 's airforce , N comes stands for Nellis . Thank you , Can I borrow your phone ? You know what , actually I can pay you for it . - I have a $ 100 ... - I don 't want your money . - Just bring bring it back . - Thank you so much . Next stop ... Chicago . Newark Station . Come on . Central . - Rutledge , please . - Please hold . - Name please . - You tell him it 's Captain Colter Stevens calling . hold the line . Dr. Rutledge is coming soon . - I have to tell you something . - I know , I 've found . Your friend ... I got him , Nellis Air Force Base , Las Vegas . No , he 's not . He 's dead , Sean . What ? I 'm sorry , your friend was killed in action two months ago . No , you must have gotten the name wrong . Colter Stevens , 17th airborne helicopter pilot , it was on the first site I tried . His father 's name is Donald , right ? This is from last week . Donald Stevens will join host Leonard Watt to discuss death of his son , Army CPT Colter Stevens who was died in Afghanistan in February he was honored posthumously with a Silver Star . Also on the broadcast wil be army Sergeant Robert Alvarez whose life was saved by CPT Stevens in a firefight just outside of Kandahar . I 'm sorry . Captain ? - Sean , talk to me . - Captain ... Cpt Stevens CPT Goodwin here . You 're with Beleaguered Castle . You 're safe . Tell me what you see . Just look and speak . - I see a card . - That 's good . Do you copy ? We are under fire here . Am I dead ? A radio listing is saying died in a helicopter crash in country . - And that my father received a medal ... - Your condition is not the issue here . You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attacks everything else is irrelevant . A news report saying that I 'm dead is irrelevent ? Until the person or persons who blew up the train are in custody ... yes . Goodwin ... One soldier to another , Am I dead ? A part of your brain remains activated . What about the rest of me I can see my hands and my feet they still move . They are manifestations They 're just your way of making sense of all this . So what are you saying ? Are you saying I 'm imagining this ? I imagining that I 'm still alive ? That I 'm in this capsule ? Captain , what just happened ? I asked you a question . The capsule is a manifestion as well . - Where am I ? - That 's classified . Fuck you ! Cpt , I can not imagine What you must be feeling right now ... But if we are to prevent the second attack we need to send you back immediately . And .. CPT you can not deviate from mission while you are inside source code Even to investigate ... Even to investigate what happened to you . There is only one continuum on this end and you cannot unsettle it . Well , you know what , I did unsettle it I called you from the train . Just before the explosion , at 07 : 46 this morning They paged you with a call from me . Maybe you made that call from the train but I would never receive it here . It 's a different reality Captain , if the call went through would be recieved by a different me entirely . This maybe be difficult to hear , but you are a hand on a clock . You understand ? We set you , you move forward , we reset you , you move again , That represents your entire function here Next time I 'll send you a pizza See if that makes an impression ! You can not alter the continuum of this reality from within in the source code . - This can 't be legal what your doing - In fact , your aquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by the Military Corp. You know , many soldiers would find this preferable to death The opportunity to continue serving their country . Have you spent much time in a battle sir ? It 's immaterial . Any soldier that I served with would say that one death is service enough . Fine , you can have that , in return completing this mission . - Have what ? - I 'll give you what you want , terminate your service , Let you die . This is taking too long , you 've been too easy on him , no more rest periods . I 'm certain we can find other servicemen with wounds similiar to yours , would consider it being part of this program an honor . No , no , no , wait . What ? Send him back . Charge the drivers . And Cpt Stevens , I 'd like you to remember , It 's not only about you but it is also about two million real world Americans . Now you may not value your own life , I do however ask that you value theirs . Calm yourself , you 're back . Did you find the bomber ? There are hundreds of people on that train . Then check them one by one . Doesn 't matter what you do , they 're already dead . Take that gun and shoot someone if you have to But get us feasible intel . Wait ! - We have to keep doing this until you find the bomber - Please , I 'm trying . Who 's the bomber ? I 'm trying . I 'm sorry CPT , I know you 're exhausted and we 're all fustrated , but we can not fail . You can do this . - I can 't . I can 't - Yes you can . You 're a born hero , son . Even your father thinks so . Saving people is what you do best . It was his decision to go I didn 't want him to go back , I started feeling like he didn 't want to come home anymore . - Dad ? - Somehow he couldn 't come home . He wouldn 't talk wouldn 't hear me . Finally he said he just couldn 't leave without them and that was that . those guys were his family . I said some things I shouldn 't have , I don 't know ... I never fully understood him . I can 't believe he 's gone . Send me back in . Please don 't blow me up again . Hello ? I know it 's you . I will find you , turn around . Hey there Why do you look so surprised ? Don 't . Don 't move , put the bag over there . Move over , put bag over there . Now , hand me your phone . - Your done - What ? - Your not killing anybody anymore . - I don 't understand . - Your gonna trigger the bomb with your phone . - What ? Dude , I swear I don 't know what your talking about . Listen , my name is George Troxel , I 'm a software engineer . I was talking to my wife . Try it again , your call dial it again . Okay , I 'm gonna press redial , your phone is gonna ring , and I 'm gonna shoot you . Shit , sorry , sorry . - You dropped this . - Wow , Thanks . Derek Frost Doors are closing ! Shit ! Come on ! Stop the train ! Hey ! Hey ! - Derek Frost ? - Yes ? - You see this ? - Yeah ? - Recognize it ? - No . Jesus ... - How bout you give me your wallet ? - Okay . Oh ! You left it on the train deliberately - I must have dropped it - No . You planted it there , So everybody would think that you were dead . I know it 's you . How do you know so much ? What is that thing ? Whoa , whoa , slow down , slow down ! - You wanna see it ? - Very patriotic . Slowly. slowly ! Back up , back up ! Not many people build that . - Okay , where 's your next target ? - Sean ? Sean Fentress Teacher . History . I don 't know you . I think I killed your girlfriend . - Why ? - You messed up my route . Why ? You mean all this ? Because the world is hell . But we have a chance to start over in the rubble . But first there has to be rubble . You 're a teacher , you would know . Christina . Stay with me . Everythings gonna be ok . This isn 't the end . Check in there , I 'll go check way . This is Beleaguered Castle . Cpt this is Beleaguered Castle acknowledge transmission . Cpt Stevens , here Beleaguered Castle acknowledge transmission . I have your bomber , I have his name . - You have the bomber 's name ? - Derek Frost . He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot . Illinois plate is , 5CGY847 . Illinois plates , 5CGY847 . Alright , let 's move . And Goodwin , there radioactive device , in the van , some kind of bomb . - Thank you , Captain - Yes , ma 'am . Thank you CPT , you 're not on the clock . About the dealk ... I had hoped that might reconsider that . The secret program . I have , I want something else now . Good . I still want to die but I want to go back in And I wanna save all those people on the train first . It doesn 't work that way , you can 't . I know . I 'm not asking you to believe me , sir , I 'm asking you to have the decency to let me try . CPD2 this is AU-SWAT1 , van is approaching Fens Gate to the corner , over . Roger that AU-SWAT1 , allow the vehicle to come down , we will stop it about halfway down , over . AU-SWAT2 this is CPD2 , block eastern end of the road , over . AU-SWAT2 , roger that . We are going switch now to a live feed from our Chicago area . The SWAT team is approaching the white van . The Illinois man , who has be sought since early this morning . The door is open , the door is open man is on the ground , it appears he has surrendered . - Congratulations on the program Goodwin . - Thanks . ... Frost started posting anti-government statements on his website . Yes , sir , it 's a real validation of the program . A clear window of just how revolutionary Source Code can be . We finally have a powerful weapon now on the war on terror . Congratulations CPT , job well done . He 's not gonna send me back is he Goodwin ? I 'm still wainting on an answer . Are you married , CPT ? Jeff , why don 't you go take a break , you deserve to celebrate . - Sure , Can I get you something ? - No , thanks . Why are you asking me on a date ? Sorry ... - Are you married ? - No . I am divorced . You think there 's an alternate version of you ? A Goodwin who made different choices ? What do you mean ? A you who didn 't get married , didn 't get divorced , just married someone else . A woman who took a different fork in the road . No , I don 't , Captain . What you experienced was a shadow , It was an after image of a victim on a train . this is real life here . The one where your talking to a dead helicopter pilot ? The program wasn 't designed to alter the past , it was desgined to affect the future . - And you 've done it . - I missed something , Captain . That train shouldn 't have blown up There must have been a second detonator , something I couldn 't see . A fail safe . It 's a computer program Captain , Um , the girl on train , all the others , they 're lost . - I 'm sorry that . - I get it , I get it . I know , quantum physics , parabola calculus . You 're wrong Goodwin , Your 'e just plain wrong . Captain , Christina is dead . She doesn 't have to be , ma 'am . - I 'll ask Rutledge . - I 'm asking you ! I 'm asking you , just ... Send me back in ... then switch me off . - Captain ... - It 's your choice . At the end of this source code , I will terminate your life support . There will be no coming back . I 'm gonna save her Goodwin . It was an honor captain . And I Thank you for your service Good luck . I took your advice . You 're gonna move to India become a guru . - Careful , ma 'am . - Yeah , I 'm gonna find myself in the mountains .

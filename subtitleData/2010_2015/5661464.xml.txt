 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - Ward is Hydra . - No . I-I don 't believe it . You think I don 't want to watch him suffer ? Not suffer ... die . - Tell us how to unlock the drive . - I start the hack . And once we reach altitude , it unlocks . Now bring him back . These vials contain the raw materials of whatever Jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead . I can 't succeed without your help . We 'll need a base of operations , weapons , tactical backup . There is no backup . It 's over . There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore . 1x21 - Ragtag Grant Ward ? My name 's John Garrett . The quartermaster at your military school 's an old Buddy of mine . He told me about a pissed-off young cadet with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination who went awol , stole a car , drove over a thousand miles home only to try and burn the place down . I must say , I find a young man like that intriguing . I 'm curious . Did you know your brother was in the house - when you set it on fire ? - No , sir , I did not . I was a pyro as a kid , too . Ended up making a pretty good living at it . I 'm here to make you a one-time offer , so listen up . Your family 's lawyer 's gonna be here in about 20 minutes . Not only are your folks pressing charges against you for arson and attempted murder , but your older brother 's petitioning the court to have you tried as an adult . Now , you can spend the next few years locked up in a cage , blaming mommy and daddy and mean older brother for your problems , or ... you can let me get you out of here and teach you how to be a man . I work for a secret organization that 's always looking to recruit young men like you . - And why should I trust you ? - You shouldn 't . Don 't trust anybody , ever , especially me . Let me be clear ... going with me will be the hardest thing you 've ever done . But on the other hand , no one will ever screw with you again . Say yes . It 'll be hard but fun . 10 seconds , and I walk out that door . Say yes . Yes . Everybody down ! On the ground ! Nobody move ! I told you it was gonna be fun . Eyewitnesses claim the assailant smashed through several walls before killing Colombia 's most notorious drug lord , Alejandro Castillo , A.K.A. El Dogo . Speculation continues as to whether this superhuman assassination was carried out by a man , monster , or machine . The correct answer is " d , " all of the above . What the hell is Deathlok doing in Bogota ? And why would he kill a drug lord with known ties to Hydra ? Well , if they really are in Colombia , then Garrett and our hijacked plane aren 't even in American airspace . I have to expand our search . Guys ... you want to come in here for a minute ? This is just about everything we 've been dealing with . And this connects them all . Cybertek built Deathlok , shipped items to Quinn , who was working for the Clairvoyant , who turned out to be Garrett , who planted Ward on our bus because he wanted to know why I didn 't stay dead . Should have drawn another chart for this part . No , I get it ... Garrett 's been developing - Centipede serum all this time . - Yes . And he wants GH-325 as its final ingredient ... a way to stabilize and regenerate his Centipede soldiers . And it 's why Ward came back for the hard drive . It had all of your research about Coulson and Skye . - It 's all on there . - But that 's not the only thing on there . - Skye left them a little surprise . - A trojan horse . It 's been slowly mapping every system they 've uploaded it to . - Well , that 's brilliant . - Trojan horse . You can wake it up and take over their systems . - Well done , Skye . - Yeah . Thanks . Except it doesn 't work that way because I didn 't have enough time to build it , so we need to plug this into one of their computers to activate it . Spoiler alert ... we can 't seem to find one . I think we have . Garrett and Cybertek have been working together for years . - If it 's on Garrett 's system ... - It 's on Cybertek 's . Which is why we 're gonna go into one of their offices . We have no authority to do this . We 're no longer S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . We 're ... - We 're vigilantes . - I was gonna say , " doing this because it 's the right thing to do , " but ... yeah . So , if you 're with me , I 'm gonna finish what I started . I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna let Garrett and Ward get away with murder . And I want my plane back . I could have crossed off that drug lord without getting my picture taken . Single shot , half a mile away . You 're missing the point . I didn 't want to just cross him off . I wanted to make a spectacle . People are killed by guns every day in Bogota . But how often does a monster punch a drug lord 's head clean off ? Hell , that 's international news . Spectacular thing you did back there , Mikey . If I didn 't know better , I 'd swear you 're starting to enjoy your job . You get the impression he 's enjoying his job ? Somebody does . Well , I 'd like to think we all enjoy our work . And why not ? These are exciting times full of rewards . Which reminds me ... Zeller . Yeah , it 's me . Stream Mike Peterson some video of his son this afternoon . Don 't mention it . How about that guy ? I 've turned him into a new man . Is that what he is ? Are you still sore about what he did to you ? No , I 'm sore at you for making him do it . Look , we 're on the verge of completing something I 've been chasing for 25 years . Can 't you just be happy for me ? See ? That 's what I 'm talking about . - Happy campers . - I think you 'll be happy , too . We 're close to replicating the drug that healed Skye and brought Coulson back to life . And the data from Skye 's hard drive , all that research ... it 's been a big help . I 've uploaded everything to the lab in Cuba . They 'll have initial results by the time we land . You never disappoint , do you , Flowers ? Wish everyone on my team had the same success rate . Okay . We 'll see you this afternoon . We 're on with the RD department up at Cybertek 's Palo Alto offices . It 'll be okay , Fitz . No matter how deep they dig , they 'll only find the new identities I 've created . It 's not that . It 's the idea of giving them access to all of our designs . We 're not actually giving them anything . We just need to get inside so we can plug Skye 's flash drive into one of their computers . - You don 't have to go . - It 's not that , either . It 's Ward . What if Garrett put an exploding eye into him , to control him ? Maybe that 's why he betrayed us . I 'm pretty sure there 's a much simpler reason . He 's evil . Well , I don 't believe that people are born evil . Something must have happened . Hey , sorry it took so long . My mom 's real sentimental about granddad 's Howling Commando stuff . Trip was generous enough to offer up some of his granddad 's spy tech to help us out , so we should systematically take a full inventory of ev ... Oh , my god . Is that a handheld hypno-beam ? One of the original betas . See how it has the switch on the bottom ? The production models moved it to the side . This is amazing ! Almost as cool as a ... - transistorized blast gun . - Transistorized blast gun . Ah , ha ha . Okay . The two of you can get a room later , but we have a plane to catch . No . Where did they buy this stuff , from the back of a comic book ? Come on , girl , that 's not really a joy buzzer . That 's a ... E.M.P. Knocks power out in about a 10-foot radius . Yeah . A lot of vintage S.H.I.E.L.D. spy craft was designed to look innocent in case a spy was caught . Like , um ... Okay . Like these smokes . Oh . Thanks , Trip . This is a huge help . Gives us a fighting chance against these bad guys . Oh , Fitz . Watch out , Hydra . Here we come . I 'm gonna retire out here one day . A thousand acres of Wyoming woods and meadows , already paid for . Speak up , son . I 'm not a mind reader . - What if the police find us ? - Nobody 's looking . Family will be happy to never see you again . As for cops , well ... they do best when they stay out of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s way . So , is S.H.I.E.L.D. academy near here ? Right now , you have more pressing issues , like what you 're gonna eat tonight . I-I thought that was our dinner . No , this is my dinner . I shot them , I eat them . Hell , Buddy deserves these birds more than you do . He retrieved them . Out here , son , if you want something , you have to earn it . For here on out , you earn everything . You want a warm place to sleep , you make it . You want something to eat , you kill it . Wait , wait . Y-you can 't be serious . All ... all I have in here are some clothes . Right ? This isn 't fair . If you 'd have told me , I-I 'd have brought tools or food ... Stop blaming me for your own failure ! Makes me not like you . You want it easy ? Go back to juvie . They 'll give you three squares and a cot . Confirm what your family believes , what everybody believes ... that Grant Ward is weak and worthless . I 'll tell you what ... I 'll leave Buddy here . You take care of him , maybe he 'll take care of you . I 'll be back in a couple of months . Either you 'll be here or you won 't . It 's up to you . But for what it 's worth I believe you can do it . Hi . Welcome to Cybertek . Sit . Please . I 'm Ott , senior V.P. of RD . This is Diaz . I 'm Theo Tittle . This is Dr. Roum . Thanks so much for seeing us on such short notice . We 've met with a number of other former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists recently , and I must say , thus far , we 're ... underwhelmed . Hydra , on the other hand , less constrained in their thinking . - And younger . - Usually younger . Yeah . - I told you we should have gone in . - Oh , hush . May looks barely a day over ... 30 . You 're gorgeous . Score one for the Howling Commandos . Your grandpa 's pin should help me locate Cybertek 's mainframe . I didn 't know they had wi-fi back in the day . They didn 't . That 's the beauty of the pin . It uses UHF to search for data . Nobody 's even scanning those frequencies for potential leaks . That 's weird . I 'm not finding any digital data about anything , let alone a source for it . How is that possible ? Maybe it 's protected . Or ... insulated somewhere inside ? Guys , just keep them busy a minute longer . Okay , now , show them the icer bullet . I designed this to be powerful ... I designed this to be powerful , nonlethal , and to break ... break up under subcutaneous tissue . And my challenge was that it could only hold a dose of ... 85 micrograms of dendrotoxin . He should have run the specs by me before building the molds . But I think we can all agree that the that the true beauty is in my hyperconcentrated ... - ... dendrotoxin formula ... - ... my cartridge-case ... - ... cartridge-case - ejection system , obviously . ... concentrated dendrotoxin formula with compressed air expulsion . We 've seen one of these bullets before . - What did they use it with ? - The sleepy-sleep gun , I think . That 's right . Our team took this rudimentary concept and converted it into an aerosol grenade . - Much more useful . - But this is an icer ! Yes , but this is an icer . Triple the stopping power and a much cooler ... name . What else do you have ? Here we go . Building permits Cybertek 's filed in the city . There 's something funky about the fourth floor . Only one way in or out . - Extra-reinforced security door . - That 's got to be it , right ? Coulson , May , can you get to the fourth floor ? - It 's a shame it didn 't work out . - It is . So lovely meeting you both . - Does your sweater itch ? - A little bit . I don 't know if I 've said it enough , but ... I 'm glad you 're back . Try not to set the drapes on fire . Skye , I think I know why you couldn 't find the mainframe . There isn 't one . What do you mean there isn 't one ? All the files are hard copies . That 's why granny was typing during our meeting . Well , we 're here . Might as well look around . - You 're staring at me again . - You gave them my son . All I see are pictures of him in a cell . I was following orders . Just like you . So , is someone playing god with you , too ? Seeing everything you see ? Waiting to push a button and blow a hole in your skull if you disobey ? Is there ? - No . - Then why are you here ? For you and others like you ... people with gifts . I 'm waiting for what 's inside to be revealed . The girl , Skye ... what do you know about her ? Where does she come from ? - Why do you care ? - Because inside , I believe she and I have something in common . Hey , Coulson . Mike Peterson 's file . How can this all be project Deathlok ? 1990 ? How far back does this thing go ? Garrett was the first Deathlok . Let 's go . Skye , Trip , get ready for a large file transfer . How large ? Back it up ! You were gonna let me die ! Okay . First off , I think we should use our indoor voices . Since the day we met , I have done everything you asked . Not sure we can say " everything . " You were gonna let Deathlok kill me to get that hard drive ? Come on . We both know the girl wasn 't gonna let you die . You said yourself Skye 's a soft touch , just like you . I am not that scared kid anymore . Then stop acting like it ! Stop being weak . All these years , and you 're still playing the victim . Sometimes I ask myself why I ever bothered . John ! John ! Everybody out ! Now ! Yeah . Here we go . That 's it . I said , " get the hell out ! " You heard the man ! Alright . Hang in there . I 'll get you stabilized . Garrett started project Deathlok way back in 1990 . Look at this . He was patient zero . We 've been looking at all this backwards . Garrett doesn 't just want GH-325 for his Centipede soldiers . He wants it for himself so he can become a real , live boy again . And if he happens to create an army of programmed super soldiers for Hydra along the way , triple bonus points . How do we know Garrett didn 't do that to Ward , too ? Maybe he 's been programmed . Fitz , when are you going to stop clinging to the idea that Ward 's the victim and not the perpetrator ? When I see something that tells me I shouldn 't with my own two eyes . We don 't know all the facts . You want a fact , Fitz ? Ward murders people . I should have let Mike finish him when I had the chance . - I 'm stupid and ... weak . - You weren 't weak . You had compassion . That 's harder . We 'll find him . Pizza delivery for Pablo Jimenez ? That 's me . Biomechanics rebooting . There . That should do it . You scared me . Hasn 't happened like that in awhile . Yes , it has . Been happening more and more . The biomechanics are fine . It 's my organs that are failing . - What are you saying , John ? - I 'm dying . Cybertek team gives me a month , two tops . You never came out to eat . Not much of an appetite . Look ... Fitz can 't process the truth about Ward , not yet . What he said ... it 's what he needs to believe . Do you think Ward 's being controlled ? - Absolutely not . - Neither do I. You know , I never gave you enough credit for this whole Zen-warrior thing . But I got to admit , it 'd be nice to feel nothing right now . You think I don 't feel anything ? Look at you . You 're a statue . And you and Ward had a thing . - So if anyone should be furious ... - I am . I 'm furious . But I 'm sure as hell not gonna waste it on a tantrum . I 'm gonna mine it , save it ... and when we find Ward , I 'm gonna use every bit of it to take him down . Wish I knew how to use that hate-fu . I 'm up most mornings at 5 : 00 . Trip I.D. ' d a number of Cybertek shipments that ping-ponged across the globe ... Brazil , Cambodia , Syria ... but they all ended up in Havana . S.H.I.E.L.D. used to have a base there . I told you we 'd find him . We 're going to Cuba . 5 bucks . - That 's it , huh ? - Sí . Same thing cost me $ 30 in Rome . There it is ... the face of our future . Mr. Quinn 's the poster boy for our new enterprise . Not sure how that 's supposed to work . He 's also an international fugitive , - accused of a laundry list of crimes . - Accused by S.H.I.E.L.D. , of whom I 've been a vocal critic for years . Now S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s gone down in flames while I rise from the ashes , all charges dismissed and my sterling reputation restored . I knew there was a reason I didn 't rip out that silver tongue of yours . Everything on schedule ? Your flamboyant display in Bogota got a lot of people 's attention . I 'll be in D.C. tomorrow , capitalizing on it . Good . It 's Raina . Maybe she has news . Okay , Ernesto , let 's show them what handsome really looks like . - Everything okay ? - Everything 's fine . - You have a problem with the drug ? - This isn 't about the drug . I thought agent Garrett shared my interest in special people , in transformation . But now I realize he was just afraid to die . So I 'm not sure how interested he 'll be in what I found out about Skye . Skye ? I probably shouldn 't be talking to you about this . I should go straight to Garrett . Garrett 's got more important things to worry about . You can tell me instead . I 've been looking through the files that Skye downloaded from the plane . And in addition to medical records , I found hospital files , adoption-agency searches . Skye 's an orphan . Been looking for her parents for awhile . It 's not exactly a secret . But that 's what intrigued me . That and her DNA . It appears to be a match for someone I heard about a long time ago . You know something about Skye 's history ? I can 't confirm it 's her , but I did hear a story about a baby girl . Years ago , a village in the Hunan province in China . It was destroyed , every man , woman , and child torn apart by monsters trying to find that baby . Did the monsters kill the baby 's parents ? No . That 's what 's so interesting . The baby 's parents were the monsters . Give me one reason not to blow your head off . I brought tacos . I was half expecting you to be long gone . I was half expecting you to never come back . You said a couple of months . It 's been six ! Been out of the country on assignment . Seems like you and Buddy did okay without me . First few weeks were rough . But then I realized my thinking was limited . So I started raiding cabins . Got some tools , the tent . Life got easier . Gonna build a cabin , over there . See ? I told you you could do it . Damn , son , you stepped up in a big way . I couldn 't be prouder if you were my own . - I lied about the tacos . - What 's that for ? Your next lesson . Your turn . Stick with me , kid . In a couple years , you 'll shoot better than that . Something about that woman unnerves me . - It 's those eyes . - No , it 's what 's behind those eyes . What did she text you about earlier ? She had questions about your decision to pack up the lab and move it to the States . I planned to expand operations anyway . The fact that the Deathlok files were stolen from Cybertek just speeds up my decision . I heard you wanted to hang on to this during the flight . You heard right . - You 've re-created GH-325 . - Almost . We 've distilled the genetic components of all the previous samples down to one single vial . And it 'll do what we talked about ? It should regenerate and heal cells , just like it did in Skye and Coulson . So take good care of it . That 's the only one in the world . You sure you don 't want anything else ? How about one of these quarter walkie-talkies ? They have a built-in homing beacon . - Okay . - I 'll keep one , too . - Thanks . - Mm-hmm . Don 't want to be greedy . We 've already got the dwarfs . No problem . All right . Because we had to fly in low , we have to search for our plane on the ground . Fitz , Simmons , you have the maps . Do not engage under any circumstances . If you find the bus , call us and stand down or come back here and wait . - We 'll be careful . - Understood , sir . Let 's do it . We 're too late . They 're gone . - They knew we were coming . - I 'm not sure everyone 's gone . Something 's generating a lot of volts in there . Yeah ? Sir , we found the bus . It 's on an airfield outside abel Santamaria packing up to leave . We 're on our way . How far is that from our location ? About three hours , but by the looks of it , they 'll be long gone by the time you can get here , sir . Get out of there right now . Do not engage . Wait for us back at the jump jet . Copy that , sir . Garrett 's leaving . We have to at least try and get over there . Or not . We still have this little puppy . If there 's a computer system in that barber shop , we don 't have to chase him anymore . We just plug it in , we wake up the trojan horse , and we 're off to the races . - Worth a shot . - Let 's do it . I know we 're not supposed to engage . But if they get away , we 'll be back to square one . I can 't handle square one again . Garrett 's there , which means Ward 's probably there , too . What if we send a dwarf into the plane from here ? It can stow away inside so we can track where the bus is going . Yes . Simmons , excellent suggestion . We can send sleepy . He 's our best listener ... next to you , of course . Okay . I 'll go get him from the car . Long time , no see . There you go . - There you go . - You know he 's not human , right ? Of course I know . No , he 's better than human . - Smart , loyal , trustworthy . - Yeah . Where does all that trust and loyalty lead ? Abandoned in the woods or dumped at the pound ? I learned that lesson the hard way . I know you 've never asked , but I 'm sure you 're curious . Nickel version ? I got fragged by an I.E.D. outside of Sarajevo . When I radioed for medevac , I got nothing but an earful of excuses . That 's when I realized I was more loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. than S.H.I.E.L.D. was to me . So I decided if I made it out , if I survived , I was gonna treat them the way they treated me . Then I stuffed my intestines back inside , duct-taped myself shut , and humped my way out . You remember when we first met ? I told you I worked for a secret organization ? Well , it 's more like I work for a secret organization inside another secret organization . You ever heard of Hydra ? Huh . Hydra understands the importance of survival . Here they are . This is our plane . We want it back . Really ? Just like that , kid ? Coulson probably figured out we 're using the barbershop . Call Kaminsky . He 'll know what to do . All right , let 's close up the ramp and get this bird off the ground . Tell the pilot to keep it low in a harrier mode - until we 're out over the gulf . - Will do . What 's he got there ? One of those prank joy buzzers . Yeah . You know me ... always kidding around . What the hell was that ? - An E.M.P. - Looks like the joke 's on you . Garrett 's dying ! Not sure this will work . Fitz shorted him out with an E.M.P. Call Cybertek . Let them know what happened . See what they can do . Get back . I 'm glad that I did it . You hear me ? You lose , we win . - You 're dead . - Well , no worse than you . And you don 't have to take orders from him anymore , Ward . Ward ! Let him die . - He deserves to die . - Get them out of here ! Clear ! Everybody out ! I have some good news . Can it wait a minute ? Damn dog takes off running every time I take a shot out here . That deer 's 1,800 meters out . It 'll take him awhile to find it . - I 'm all ears . - You 've been accepted by S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s operations division , effective immediately . - We need to pack up . - Thank you , sir , for everything . Don 't do that . You don 't owe me or anybody else a thing . You earned it by yourself . It 's gonna be hard when you get there . If you 're gonna work within S.H.I.E.L.D. for Hydra , you can 't ever get attached to anyone or anything . You have to fight that weakness in you . - Yes , sir . - Good . Now take care of Buddy , and we 'll get out of here . That 's not a weakness , is it ? No , sir . Good . I 'll be at the truck . Internal battery must have fried . I 'm gonna have to open it up , see if there 's a mechanical fix . I talked to Cybertek . They 're prepping a facility in Miami . Good . I need you to do something for me . - Yeah . Anything . - Put down Fitz and Simmons . What ? No . There 's plenty of time . I won 't leave you . And I 'm telling you to cross them off for me . That 's not a weakness , is it ? - No . - Then take care of them . I 'll take care of me . - I 've cheated death plenty of times . - I 'll stay . - Skye , where are the computers ? - I 'm working on it . Trip , anything in your granddad 's kit might help us out here ? Always . Let me take a look . There 's a mechanical failsafe in case the electronics shut down . I 'm pretty interesting inside . That 's my Centipede serum . It 's the only thing that 's been keeping me alive these past few months . - Why isn 't it making you strong ? - I 'm too far gone . I 'm afraid your entire system is shutting down . Maybe you can jump-start it ... with this . Coulson will find us , won 't he ? Man won 't rest until every Hydra agent is either dead or behind bars . Go ! Go . Oh ! Oh , no ! Go , go ! Open the door , Fitz . Ward , please ... - I need to understand . - You need to accept the truth , Fitz . He doesn 't care about us , about anything . No . I don 't believe that . We 're friends , aren 't we ? We 've been friends . We 've had laughs together . I know that you 're a good person , Ward . And you can choose right now to be good . It 's a choice . I 've got my orders . Open up the door . No . - Not a chance . - Yeah . Okay . Have it your way . Wait . What are you doing ? Fitz . Okay . Wait . - What are you doing ? - Wait . - No , no , no . - Okay , wait . - Ward , just think about this . - Wait , Ward . Ward . - Okay , wait , wait , wait , wait ! - Just give it a second ! Wait , wait , wait ! Okay , okay , okay ! - Just loo ... Ward , look at me ! - Think about this ! Ward , just turn around ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it , Ward ! Okay , you don 't have to do this ! - Ward ! - You don 't have to ! You have a choice ! Ward ! Ward , look at me ! I know that you care about us , Ward ! You 're right . I do . It 's a weakness . - Ward ! Ward ! - Waaard ! I can 't promise it 'll work . And once it 's gone , I won 't be able to make any more . This is the end of the road . Without it , I 'm dead for sure . So ... what the hell ? That 's it . The final ingredient . Is it done ? If the job was easy ... What are you feeling ? The universe . Come on . Over here . There 's something behind this wall . - Okay , I got something . - Secret door ? I got this . They 're like my thing . - Here we go . - Finally . It 's a Centipede soldier . " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " will return in a moment . Bogota was a freebie , a calling card , a demonstration of what we can do . - It was a circus . - It was a single man with no support team and no extraction plan . I mean , come on . Tell me ... how much did you spend to get Bin Laden ? Between the ships and the choppers and the support troops , what was it ? $ 30 million ? - $ 50 million ? - Whatever the price , it was worth it . Maybe . My super soldier could have done it for a fraction of the price . Is that why you 're here ? Are you proposing to sell us - this super soldier of yours ? - God , no . I 'm proposing to sell you a thousand of them . Better , stronger , faster . Gentlemen , with the continued exposure of corrupt institutions like S.H.I.E.L.D. , with the terrifying rise of Hydra , the need for reliable security is at an all-time high . Which is why we are expanding our super-soldier operations into a brand-new , state-of-the-art Cybertek facility . So , would you and your friends like a tour ?

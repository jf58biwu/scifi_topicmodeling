 Barbie : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Oh , hunter may , meet my son dale . You 're gonna get me to the dome . The place where the national guard Shoots trespassers on sight ? Barbie ! Don 't jump ! Joe : Maybe the guys who took barbie Are the same ones who want the egg . How would they even know about it ? We 'll protect it . No better place to hide Than right under my dad 's nose . And you all think it powers the dome ? That 's the-the working theory , right ? Big jim : It 's my job to lead the people Of this town to freedom . Barbie : Who are you ? She 's a friend of mine- - pauline verdreaux . Pauline rennie ? James ' mother . I think that door 's the way back into the dome . Barbie : I know where this is . Grew up there . All right . Let 's go , let 's go . What the hell ? Sam : We 're back somehow . Pauline ? Pauline ? It 's me . That 's impossible . You ... What are you doing here ? Did the dome send you ? Like linda and dodee to torment me ? What ? No , jim . It 's really me . No , no . No . You died . You died nine years ago . You ... I was never dead . You drove your car into a tree . I ... I saw the wreck . I read the report . I picked out your casket . I was never inside the car . It was a cadaver . Lester coggins helped me . And lyle , too . He knew what to use to make the car burn So that there would be nothing left . It was the only way ! The only way for what ? It was the only way to get out of chester 's mill ! I told you About my visions . You saw my paintings . I knew something terrible was coming . So you ran away and left me and junior ? To protect my family . I thought the dome would follow me . And you would never let me go ! You 're gonna stand here In your son 's room And make excuses to me ? Stop it . You destroyed him , pauline . You destroyed your own son . ( crying ) : Stop . For all these years , I thought it was my fault . Jim ... Jim ? I came back . Jim , I came back ! Hey . Hey . Look at this . See anything strange ? Its leaves have turned . Like it 's fall . Except it 's summer . The temperature 's dropped in the last two days . This is an oak . One of the first to change . Any idea why this is happening ? Somehow the dome is accelerating the seasons . Normally , fall 's my favorite . Book by the fire , nice glass of pinot , but This is just odd . Julia : Oh , my god ! Julia ? Julia ? You came back . I did . I 'm gonna get everybody out . What happened ? How are you here ? Barbie , how the hell did you get back ? ( shivers ) Let 's do this inside . It 's freezing . Sure . Since when did it become alaska in here ? No kidding . And , uh ... Melanie 's not here . Junior either . We have the whole place to ourselves . Better keep each other warm . ( laughs ) Wait . Melanie hasn 't been here in , like , a day . She 's probably at julia 's . ( groans ) Or out doing Jane fonda exercises , Whatever people did in the ' 80s . Oh , come back . Oh , my god , joe . The egg is gone . What ? You think she took it ? The way she protects that thing , I bet she did . Come on , let 's go find her . Junior ? Oh . Sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . It 's okay . I should go . Julia might be worried . I shouldn 't have let us fall asleep . If she 's mad I didn 't come home , I 'll just blame it on you . Tell her you locked me up down here . What ? I-I was just kidding . ( quiet laugh ) Um ... You 're sure the egg 's safe down here ? Uh , this place is built To withstand nuclear bombs . It 's the safest place in town . Well ... I guess I 'll see you later . Uh , yes . See you later . Junior ! ( panting ) Angie ? Think about what you 're doing . With her down here ? It-it 's not what you think . You 're gonna want to follow your heart . Don 't . I-I don 't know what you mean . Melanie : Junior ? ( footsteps approaching ) Did you say something ? No . Okay . Bye . Bye . Angie ? Angie ? So you jump off an underground cliff and somehow land All the way in zenith ? It surprised the hell out of me , too . But the same thing happened to sam And lyle . And you feel okay ? No physical injuries Or-or psychological disturbances ? The way there was a blur , but ... But I woke up , I was fine . The way back ... I had this memory From a long time ago . What ? It was just something From when I was a kid . How 'd the others fare ? He didn 't come up out of the water with the rest of us . Is he dead ? You know , maybe he came up first . He drowned . Or maybe he 's trapped somewhere in between . I don 't know . What matters is That we can use that cliff To get everybody out of here . But we need a plan . Last thing we want is a stampede . Let 's start with the people we trust . I will walkie tom and andrea . Have them meet us at the sweetbriar in an hour . All right . ( door closes ) there 's finally a way out . And I don 't know if we should take it . Sam : Melanie ! Sam ? How are you alive ? I survived the fall . Listen , I 'm not back to hurt anyone . Especially you . Push you into the crater that night . So , it was lyle ? Yes . I helped bury you . We all did . And then we ran . And I 've regretted it every day since . Imagine if you 'd trusted me , and protected the egg . Maybe none of this would 've happened . Maybe the dome wouldn 't have come down . Maybe no one would 've died . Melanie ? I am so sorry ... Melanie . For everything . I have a lot of unfinished business . And I figured this might be my only chance . You never know how many chances you 're gonna get . Pauline : Jim , what are you doing ? I was just thinking . I thought maybe I 'd find junior out here . It 's exactly as it was the day I left . It was my way of keeping you alive . I used to come out here and ... Stare at these and try to figure out What made you so ... Crazy ? Tormented . Where were you , pauline ? How did you get inside the dome ? Through a cellar door On barbie 's family property in zenith . Barbie ? You saw dale barbara in zenith ? Fate , I guess . He came back with me . And sam . And a former student of mine . And lyle . Except lyle didn 't make it . I 'm sorry to hear that . But why would you want ... To come here ? For junior . And you . Whatever my reasons , I was wrong . No , you weren 't . You were right . About the pink stars falling , about the dome , About everything . All of it . I wasn 't a good man back then . I know that . I didn 't listen , I kept pushing you away . But the dome has shown me things , A new way to be . And now it 's brought you back to me . Pauline , I can ... I can prove to you that I 've changed . Jim , I-I don 't know . You loved me once before , didn 't you ? Yes . Very much . Well , then we can be a family again . I 'm gonna lead everyone out of here . And when it 's over , when you and me and junior are out We 'll be together . ( chuckles ) I have always believed that the dome is here to protect us . What if it still is ? Maybe it started out that way , okay ? But there 's barely any food left . You got no medical supplies . Now , all of a sudden , it 's getting colder by the hour . I realize that . But lyle didn 't make it . I mean , if these people die getting out , that 's on us . What I know is : We stay here , we die here . And what 's waiting in zenith ? The playground is under surveillance . You were interrogated , beaten . That 's because they wanted the egg . So I say this : Let 's give it to ' em . Y ... My dad sent that video , right ? He 's behind this whole thing . So my thinking is , if we give him what he wants , Maybe they leave us alone . So ... We leverage the egg . I go first and I tell them that it 's theirs , So long as they let the whole town through . You come last with the egg . I have to go first . No . No , you 're not , no . There 's no way I 'm letting you do that ... What would 've happened if you hadn 't escaped ? It 'll be worse if they capture you again . I should go . Julia , they 're not gonna go easy on you . I can handle it . And if you don 't get a message Agreeing to the deal , you 'll be here . Mm-mm . These people are gonna need you . No . If I don 't get a message Agreeing to the deal ... I come after you . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Melanie . Where were you ? I was ... ( gasps ) You 're back ! ( whispers ) : Hey . It 's good to see you . Mel . Where 's the egg ? It 's ... Gone from angie 's apartment . But ... But barbie 's here . Why do you want it ? ( wry laugh ) Because it 's our way out . ( murmuring ) N-no . I 'm sorry , julia , but ... I , I can 't tell you where it is . ( whispers ) : Hey . Can I talk to you for a second ? All four hands should have a say in where the egg is kept And melanie 's probably sitting on it in a nest she built somewhere . So we 'll find it Well , julia and dodee built that yagi thing . It 's a piece of crap . Yeah , so we 'll build a better one . Norrie : Who the hell are you ? ( softly laughs ) hey . I 'm hunter . And you 're joe mcalister , vlog master , A hundred and forty characters at a time . Okay . How do you know who we are ? Especially since you 've , apparently , Just popped up out of the ether . Well , a : You guys are Celebrities online . And b : I just came from zenith with barbie . Barbie 's back ? I wasn 't about to turn down the chance to check out the dome . It was a ... ( taps twice ) Watery arrival ... But my phone survived- - Obviously there 's no service , But that is my site 's homepage . Hounds of diana . You e-mailed me . Uh-huh . ( chuckles ) and direct tweeted me . Yeah . Hunter . What are you doing here Uh ... Desperately trying to , uh , establish contact With the outside world , but ... No luck . Want help tracking down that egg ? No . You guys were loud coming down that hallway . What do you know about the egg ? I ... Work for barbie 's dad at aktaion . ( laughs ) that egg 's been the subject Of many of a meeting . I 'd say our best best 's a sound wave detector . All energy sources emit a frequency , Even if we can 't hear it . That could work . Do you think we could get our hands on a radar gun ? Oh , the police station has to have one . Well , you guys know If there 's anything to eat around there ? Because all I brought was this ? I call dibs . Food from the outside ? What did it feel like when the bomb hit this thing ? I 'll tell you after you tell us How you got in here . No . I can 't tell you where the egg is . But ev-ev ... ( grunts ) ... Even if it 's our ticket out of here ? No . ( birds chirping ) You know , I 've seen that necklace before . Yeah . You found it where they buried me . Let me ask you ... Have you ever been to , uh ... A big white house in zenith ? There 's a b-big lawn ... Um ... Pool ... There 's a root cellar . With a red door . ( softly laughs ) With a red door , yeah . Yeah , and my mom brought me there once . I-I spent the afternoon Playing with this little boy ; He was so sweet . We painted that door red And he-he put his hand on it . Yeah . That-that was me , Melanie . That was me- - I was that boy . Uh ... But ... Uh ... How do you know ? ! I know , because I remember . I , I was there , I remember . We were , we were playing And then you-you had to leave in a hurry ... Yeah . My mom was So upset , she ... That-that-that-that boy 's dad ... Um ... Your ... Your dad , He kept saying , " laura , laura . I 'm so sorry . " Oh , my god . What ? My parents ... Used to fight about a woman named laura , Because I guess my dad was in-in-involved with her In a relationship before he married my mother . Your dad and my mom ? Yeah . They had ... They had a daughter together . Wait . Are you saying that ... ? I 'm saying ... That you are my sister , melanie . ( laughs softly ) That 's why she brought me there . To meet you Before we moved . She never would tell me who my father was . It 's why you looked so familiar . Yeah . And that 's ... That 's why I had this memory On the way back into the dome . This wasn 't a coincidence ; there 's a reason for this . What 's the reason ? You and I are supposed to lead people out of here , Into zenith , but we need the egg to do that . No . No . No , I-I can 't give it up . I ... I know something bad will happen If I don 't protect it . Melanie , I 'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you . Just come to sweetbriar rose with us , okay ? Hear us out . Okay . Big jim : Junior 's 18th birthday . ( sobs , sighs ) I 've missed so much of my son 's life . Pauline , you 're gonna be ... A part of everything That has to do with this family moving forward . ( door creaks open ) ( door closes ) Mom ? ( exhales ) : Oh , james . Uh ... James ... Oh ... ( exhales ) How ... How are you here Right now ? It 's a long story . You can , um ... You can tell him over breakfast , then . Where are you going ? I 'm sheriff- - I 've got responsibilities to the town . I got to ... Talk to barbie about an exit strategy . Be good to your mom , junior . Uh , d-do you want me to get you something to eat ? No , no , I 'm ... I 'm okay . Come on , I 'll make you something . Mom , mom , stop , stop . Stop . Is there ... You can have ... Lyle told me why you left . You saw the video and you didn 't tell jim ? No . I didn 't know how . ( exhales ) that 's for the best . Your father and I , we 're not good for each other . He thinks we 're a family again . If that helps us get out , that 's fine . Everybody had their reasons for coming back . You 're mine . Barbie 's back . Who else ? Sam . Your uncle has a lot to atone for . He can never do that for killing angle . He only did it because of what I put in my journal . You drew a picture ! He murdered A girl . ( exhales ) Where are you going ? To the station- - I 'm dad 's deputy . ( high-pitched ringing ) ( sighs ) ( ringing continues ) ( breathing heavily ) ( screaming ) Make it stop ! ( sobbing ) : Make it stop . It 's not as crazy as it sounds . That cliff leads To the same place it did for barbie : Our deaths . Barbie : It leads to zenith . I guarantee it . Oh , I don 't believe it . Look , please , we need you guys on board To help us get everyone out . We 'll use the census . We divide the town into groups , everyone gets a leader And someone with first aid experience and a mix of ages . Chester 's mill is our home . We 're not forcing anyone to leave . But staying 's a really bad idea . You feel how cold it is ? Our microclimate 's disrupted . With dwindling fuel And not enough food , we have to get out while we can . I 'm not doing anything till I know Where big jim stands on this . ( door opens ) what about you , tom ? ( door closes ) sign me up as a leader . There 's nothing left for us here . So , assuming people do take a leap of faith And jump off the cliff , what happens when we get to zenith ? Uh , the plan 's for julia to go first . She 's gonna lay out the terms . Which are ? Safe passage for the entire town . Once everyone else is out , barbie And melanie will jump with what they want . " they " being the soldiers in black . And what they want ... ( door opens ) Is the egg . ( door closes ) And how do I fit into your little plan ? 'cause I 'm a part of it . Starting now . Is this what you 're looking for ? That 's it . Okay . Changed the firmware to adjust the if output . Yep . The wave guide 's modified , enhancing the tonal range . Uh , translation from geek , please ? We 're making it pick up high-pitched frequencies Instead of movement . Oh . Of course . By the way , once we get out ? Don 't mention any of this To my parole officer . She wouldn 't approve . Wait . You have a parole officer ? Repercussion of exploiting the server vulnerabilities Of fortune 500 companies . Sounds awesome . Nothing compared to finding out What it 's like under the dome . Ironic . All we want to know Is what 's happening outside of it . Okay . Well , you want to do the honors ? It works . The egg is somewhere to the west . Okay , so , what are we waiting for ? Actually , hunter , thanks for helping us build this thing . But ... That 's as far as it goes . Yeah . Unfortunately . It 's just something norrie and I Have to do alone . Dude , it 's no worries . I ... I actually want to go get some pictures around town For my hounds of diana web site . You don 't trust him ? I-I-I trust us . We 're two of the four hands . Not him . You really think he 'd take the egg for himself ? And how would he know that there 's a locker at the school That leads to a cliff that 's the way out of chester 's mill And we have to do is jump ? Joe : Maybe barbie told him . Anyway , we have a signal . Let 's find that egg . We give them the egg , we get our freedom . We have to do this carefully , jim . Whoever 's out there 's not gonna detain 2,000 people . This is still america . You mean the same people that bombed this place , right ? You-you don 't even know what you 're dealing with . I know what 's best for this town . Which is why I 'll be going first To negotiate . Excuse me ? I 'm the sheriff . I 'm the only elected official here . You 're also a lifelong used car salesman . Which means I know how to cut a deal . Love me or hate me , I get things done . Your whole family 's here now , right ? He goes first . He goes first , they stay behind . That way he 's got every reason to make sure That we all get through safely . ( stammers ) fine . Fine . Go first . But not until the entire town has been informed And the exit teams are in place . I 'll leave that in your hands . Spread the word as fast as you can . ( door opens , closes ) you heard it . The whole plan depends on taking the egg with us . What do you say , melanie ? Pauline , we 're leaving ! I worked it out . You , me and junior , we 're getting out of here . We 're gonna be free . It 's coming soon , soon . It 's coming . What are you ... ? Oh , my god . It 's the end of everything , jim . I see it in my head . That 's you , me and junior . My head- - make it stop ! Is this what 's gonna happen next ? ( groaning ) Is our family in danger ? Oh , it hurts . Make it stop . What 's hurts ? Make what stop ? Make it stop . What are you talking about ? The egg . It 's screaming . The egg ? Well , where is it ? What ... ? Really ? You can 't hear that ? I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! I can 't hear it ... Oh , god ! You haven 't changed . You don 't believe me . Just like always . I have changed . I do believe you . Everything you painted has came true . I believe you , I just ... I can 't ... Stop . Stop it . Babe , babe , babe , calm down . Stop it ! Stop it ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Get out of here ! Get out ! Calm down ... Get out ! I 'm trying to help . Get out ! Aah ! Just calm down ! I 'll-I 'll help you ! I 'll-I 'll get help , I promise . ( moaning ) Calm down ! No , no , no , no , no ! No ! Don 't lock me in here , please ! Don 't lock me in here ! I 'm trying to keep you safe . Listen , I 'll get us out of here , I promise ! I made a deal with a guy , okay ? Jim , please ! Please ! He 's gonna take care of our family . I promise he 'll get us out of here ! No , no ! Trust me ! Just got to find that damn egg . ( high-pitched ringing ) ( high-pitched ringing ) She was right about this , too . ( high-pitched ringing ) You 'll let me carry the egg over ? Yeah , I-I will be beside you the entire time . Do we really have to give it to those people out there ? Once our dad sees you alive again , That is all he 's gonna care about . Not some egg . I need a minute . ( door opens ) Did you just make a promise You can 't keep ? Right now , this is all riding on her And big jim talking the talk . Oh , that actually worked out well . I know . He doesn 't mean anything to your dad . And now neither one of us has to risk being nabbed . Hey . Are you having second thoughts ? Not about leaving . No . About what ? We met because of the dome . And we never really talked about you and me Out in the world . Oh . ( laughs ) Julia . Hey . I want you in my life Whether we end up in zenith Or wherever . That 's a promise that I can keep . ( door opens ) Good . Melanie : Guys . You want the egg or not ? ( high-pitched ringing ) That 's it . Let 's get it and get the hell out . Why is it screaming ? Something 's scaring it . ( high-pitched ringing stops ) It 's not us . You calmed it down . Now it 's time to go . ( gasps ) Where ? The cliff under the school . That thing 's going to zenith . Barbie 's back . There 's no reason . It 's not a debate . I don 't have to do anything you say . You 're right . You don 't , I 'm gonna shoot him . Don 't worry about me , norrie . All that matters is protecting the egg . You wouldn 't shoot joe . There 's a long list of people who 've gone against me . I got no problem adding joe mcalister to it . Let 's go . Pretty calm for a dead man . I figured you 'd stop by . I hope it doesn 't have to end this way . Angie hoped it wouldn 't end with you Swinging an axe down on her head . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . You put her bracelet under my bed so I 'd think I blacked out and killed her . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know what else to do . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon . Junior , I can 't take back what I 've done . You still have a choice . You 're right . Bullet 's too quick . ( grunting ) You still have to suffer . ( grunting ) Get up . Get up ! ( groaning ) Hit me . Fight back . Fight back . Fight back ! Fight back ! ( groaning ) ( grunting ) ( panting ) ( grunting ) ( panting ) I 'm gonna do to you ... What you did to angie . Angie : Junior , stop ! ( sighs ) Where is the signal ? Big jim : Shut up . Keep going . All right , let 's go . Through the locker and to the cliffs . Come on . You can 't kill him . How can you come back and protect him ? Sam still has a part to play . So does each of the hands . If he dies , everyone under the dome Will suffer . I loved you , and he took you away from me . You never loved me . You locked me up , wanting to keep me . That 's not love . That is possession . Why do something that can 't be undone To avenge a love that wasn 't even real ? You 're not real . You 're just the dome playing tricks on me . Junior , I 'm telling you not to do this . ( breathing hard ) Look at me . Look at me . Don 't do it . For me . Look at me . Look at me ! No ! ( sobbing ) See , angie ? I really did love you . ( sniffles ) It 's freaking out . What are we supposed to do ? Do not throw the egg . If that 's the power source to the dome , We could all die . If I don 't , he 'll kill you . That 's enough talking . That thing needs to go , now . ( high-pitched ringing ) look at it . It doesn 't want me to . Well , maybe it doesn 't want to be here . This is about my family . Now , you throw it over now . What about the rest of us ? You 've always said you love Everybody in chester 's mill . I do . Then don 't make us do this . My wife is suffering . And everybody 's gonna get out , too , okay ? But that egg needs to go now . ( norrie gasps ) ( high-pitched ringing stops ) ( panting ) See ? Okay , no one 's dying . Everything 's okay . ( rumbling , cracking ) Joe ! ( yells ) Run . Run ! ( rumbling , glass shattering ) No ! It was right here , It was right here ! Okay , we gotta go ! We gotta go now ! Junior took it ? I don 't know ! Let 's go ! Okay , come on ! No ! ( grunts ) melanie ! Melanie ! I don 't know . She 's barely breathing . Help me get her up . Come on , help me ! Hey , I 'm down here ! Come on ! Help me ! Help ! ( rumbling , cracking continues ) ( grunting ) Junior , where 's your uncle ? What happened ? I don 't know ! Where 's sam ? Sam ! Put her down on the table . Get my emt bag from the kitchen . She collapsed during the earthquake . Her pulse is weak . Sam : Shallow breathing ... We gotta get her heart rate up . What happened to your face ? Don 't worry about it . Atropine ! It 's in the vial . It 's atropine . Melanie ... Junior : How long before it works ? ( coughs ) ( panting ) Did you take the egg ? No . Is it gone ? Maybe joe and norrie have it . Oh , I just hope they 're okay . We should go find them . Barbie : Yeah . Stay with her . And , sam , don 't let anything happen to her . Her pulse is still weaker than it should be . Right now , What she needs is rest . The dome was right . If I 'd killed you earlier , She 'd be dead . If I don 't find a way to keep her stable . She 's one of the hands . You better . Is it safe ? Safer than staying down here . Nice of big jim to wait . ( grunts ) ( screams ) Come on . Come on , I got you . Pull me up ! Come on ! I got you ! Come on . ( whimpers ) Come on . You okay ? What the hell was that earthquake ? You don 't want to know . Let 's get out of here Before another one happens . Yeah . Come on . I thought you went to take photos . I forgot my battery pack . Good thing , huh ? Yeah . ( rumbling ) Big jim : Pauline . Pauline , are you okay ? They 're gone . What 's gone ? My visions . The minute the earthquake hit , they stopped . Well , let 's go . Come on , let 's get out of here . I don 't know what 's gonna happen now . We go get junior and we 're the first three over the cliffs . I tell the guard on the other side I gave him what he wanted . The egg stopped screaming . I know . Because I threw it over the cliff . To zenith . No ... I did it ... I did it for you . I did it ... No , jim . No . ( crying ) What have you done ? They gotta be here somewhere . Big jim made us throw the egg off the cliff . What ? He did what ? He had a gun . All right , let 's go . Come on . Phil ! I ... Phil , stop ! Barbie , here ! Careful . He 's gone . Barbie : What the ... ? There 's a bottom now . The egg 's gone . The passage closed . We 're stuck here . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

 Why is my brother still a suspect ? Is that all of it ? Do you think I kept a piece ? This has one number one it - mine . Don 't tell anyone you have these . No ! 'Police have a suspect in custody , a Russian national named ' as Anya Lutvchenko . ' Anya ! He is the beating heart of all of this , and if we can find his identity , it ends , and you go home . 'That 's who Mr Rabbit is . ' Shut her up ! Ian , is she OK ? Please , stop her screaming , now ! I can 't stop her screaming , Wilson , she 's lost her fucking mind ! Stop her screaming or I will drive this van into a fucking wall ! I 'm not saying we dump her ! What are you saying then , Wilson ? - I 'm saying we can 't look after her ! - Shhht ! She must have grandparents , or relatives . Why are you even saying that ? You know they 'll be there waiting , if we go within a million miles of her family . So what 's your big idea , Becky ? I don 't fucking have one , shithead ! Couldn 't we just leave her somewhere , like a police station or a hospital ? You might as well put a bullet in her head right now . Are you suggesting shooting her ? Of course I 'm not - what the fuck is the matter with you ? All right , pack it in ! We ... we have to take her with us . It 's the only thing we can do . No , look , just call Milner . I called at six , you saw me ! The next contact time 's midnight . Taking that girl with us is insane ! How are we going to look after her ? It 's not just her life ! It 's Grant 's , it 's ours ... Right , I 've had enough of your shit - I 'm taking her with us . You don 't have to come if you don 't want to . What do you mean ? Like a break up ? Yeah ... if you 're going to be all fuckin ' ... you know . Mr Rabbit was supposed to be our ticket out of all this . There 's still Milner . She 'll help . Then has it occurred to you , the only reason she 's not answering is because she knows we lost the manuscript . Taking Alice with us is not a good decision . She needs help . This will end bad . All she 's got is us . Did you see how she looked at us ? Like we 're terrifying . Becky , she 's in shock . No ... She 's right . We 're scary . That 's what we 've become . We 're just like them now . What 's that ? A piece of finger ! How did you get involved in all this ? Remember SARS ? I worked for the Martarla Foundation who discovered it . One of their top scientists , a rising star - six figure salary , use of a private jet - you ever been on a private jet ? It 's nice . I was in Hong Kong when SARS hit . They kept it locked down , but I thought , " Fuck that , I 'm special . " So I went in , had a look and found out it didn 't exist . What ... SARS didn 't exist ? Nope . Whole thing was just a series of unconnected respiratory infections , took me under an hour to discover that there was no cause or link . So , I filed my report ... and within a week ... I was discredited , research destroyed ... fired . I tried speaking out , but everyone thought I 'd just gone a bit , " David Icke " . But people died , SARS was ... Started in November 2002 . It lasted precisely seven months , by summer 2003 it no longer existed . The " pandemic " affected just 8,422 people and killed 916 . Do you know how many people die each year from random respiratory problems ? SARS did not exist . Next question - why did they do it ? Answer - I don 't fucking know . All I know was within the next few weeks I was embroiled in a sex scandal ... Professor Pervert - addicted to coke and prostitutes . So did they just set you up ? Yes ... Well , no ... I do like cocaine and prostitutes , but they didn 't have to tell anyone . I 've never heard of Martarla . No , no-one has , but you 've heard of the parent company ... Corvat ? Erm , why don 't you come back tomorrow , I 've got a lot of tests . Tomorrow - no fucking way . I 've got to do some more tests . I am not leaving that here . Come back at one , I promise I 'll have something by then . Where are you going ? There 's a thing I have to ... I said one . OK , yes , I did the test , and it 's flu . They 're right - Russian flu . No , you 're lying . Where 's the sample ? I can 't give it you back , I mean it 's infected ... and I 'm not lying . What 's in there ? Papers . Nothing , but papers . No , no ... Ow ! Arghhh ! Grrrr . Ow ! Is this it ? Is this it ? It 's not what you think . Oh , Jesus Christ . It was chemical poisoning . No flu at all ! You have no idea how powerful ... and rich they are . Let 's split it . You want to use this for money ? ! They ruined my life ... and I deserve compensation . I deserve it ! Wait ! Think about the money ! Jesus Christ , it 's massive ! Yeah , I told you we 'd find the place eventually . Is it time to call Milner ? Yeah . Let 's just pray she answers . Come on ! Arby has the manuscript . But there are pages missing . He thinks Jessica Hyde removed them . And there 's something else . I think he had her and I think he let her go . You 've gone all Goth ! I 'm in hiding . We have to hide . You OK ? Alice , do you want to talk about what ... ? I 've got an essay due Friday . How am I going to get it in ? It 's on crime and punishment . I need to finish it . Do you have a laptop ? What about paper ? Is there paper ? There must be paper . I 'm on for an A. I don 't want my mark to drop . Alice , I 've got paper . I 've got paper . - How am I going to get it in ? - Get it done . I 'll find a way . Staying in one place is stupid ! So is going cross country with a child who 's having a breakdown ! Don 't make me the bad guy . I ... Why am I even ... ? You 've both decided , haven 't you ? You 've both ... Fuck ! Fuck ! Come with me . Just come . Come on . We can 't go to a restaurant , so I thought we 'd make our own . Our date , remember ! Come on ! Menu 's shit . We 've got salt and vinegar crisps . Peperami and cheese . Oh , my God ! This is shit . And the only drink 's Fanta . I hate Fanta . Is this a table tennis table ? Mm hm . Oh , and after ... We 've got a movie . Stare at that and I describe the plot to Spiderman 2 . Thank you . Have you still got those pages ? Jessica ! You haven 't told anyone about those pages ? - No . - Don 't . Don 't tell anyone , Grant . Just you and me . OK ? I 'll be around . I 'll keep an eye on you , I promise . What ? Are you leaving ? Keep this up or you 'll die . Are you sure you don 't remember the name of Mr Rabbit ? Just it began with an ' L ' . What 's over there ? Grant ... ? What were you hiding when I came in ? Drawings ? You did drawings of the manuscript ? Why didn 't you tell us ? Well , they ain 't very good . I can 't remember her name . The woman in the book . The woman Raskolnikov kills . He kills this woman , this old woman . He kills her and I can 't remember her name . You can just say , " The woman ! " No , I can 't . I need the book . Where 's the book ? I need it . We haven 't got the book . No ! I can 't . I need the book . Where 's the book ? It 's OK . Alyona . Alyona Ivanovna . I 'll go get you some more paper . Give us that . Give us it ! I 'm using it ! Just give the paper at the back ! Popeyed shit-legs . I don 't know . I never really knew what I wanted to do . My brother was always nagging me about squandering my brain , thought I was a genius . I miss him . He 's very driven , psycho-driven . This reminds me of him . He was mad for table tennis when we were kids . I 'd do anything to see him again . Well , this is nice . Better than drunk shagging and angry shagging . Yeah . Though shagging was nice . Hm . Problem for you , though , is how are you going to get in my knickers without me being drunk or angry ? Yeah . Well ... I could try telling you that I like you . That I think a lot about your lips , your eyes , your smile . I could tell you that I know you 're in the room even before I 've seen you . And I could tell you that despite all this madness , murder and mayhem , there 's a corner of my soul that feels like it 's coming alive because of you . Mm . Yeah . That might do it . Good ! Fuck ! Shit ! Don 't worry . It was an accident . Fuck . It 's OK , it 's OK . The great thing about this place , you can spill anything . You 're never gonna believe this ! I 've been looking at these drawings that Grant did of the manuscript . What are you twats doing ? Grant did drawings ? Yeah , just a few . And , no , not of Mr Rabbit . But do you remember this ? The Scientist makes a thing called a ghost cell which he puts into a buffalo . The buffalo 's killed , fed to the man and the man rots . Yeah . It 's what all the BSE conspiracy stuff was based on . Yeah . Look , Grant 's drawings ! The Scientist creates a god with two faces . And the god goes inside the ghost cell . Roman mythology ! A god with two faces ! It 's Janus . And that 's how they get it into us . Via the food chain , the same way they did with BSE . But , it would be noticed ! Testing ! Maybe it looks like something else . There 's tons of bacterial shit in food . And if Corvadt 's a Nazi ... Like what , a disease that targets certain races ? What if it 's not the disease that 's selective , what if it 's the cure ? Russian flu . Corvadt are making the vaccine . Right . How do you get flu ? Somebody sneezes and you breathe it in . No . No , no . You ingest it . Mostly you get it on your hands and you ingest it . So , they adapt some fucking weapons-grade flu virus so it can be hidden in food , and Corvadt make a vaccine that 's only effective on certain races . After Fetlar , people are terrified . One more outbreak like that and they 'll be rioting to get it in their arms . Fuck testing ! But you 'd need it in so much food . Yeah , you would . See that symbol . It 's everywhere in Part Two . Don 't you recognise that symbol ? Pergus Holdings , they 're massive . Like Kraft or Nestle . They manufacture everything from crisps to fizzy drinks , to pet food and that is their logo . Fuck ! Have a nice date ? Jesus Christ ! Where 've you been ? Are you and Becky an item now ? Where the fuck have you been ? The phone Milner gave you . Take it out and call her . No , Jessica . Look , I don 't know what your game is , but I am not ... Call Milner . Voicemail . Tell her you 're with Jessica Hyde . It 's Ian . I 'm with Jessica Hyde . If they were tapping her phone , you 've just killed her . You still think so small , Ian . So ... IT . " Gone to get supplies " ? What is it with him and notes ? Becky , if I show you something , will you ... Becky , if I show you something , do you promise not to get angry ? No , show it me ! I found it in the van . Don 't worry , I turned it off , but if we were to turn it on ... We need to find out about Purgus Holdings . Now , I can find download malware that will confuse the IMEI of this - any search will make it look as though ... So let 's go for a walk . Do it from far away to be safe . How 's Alice ? Grant said all she 's talking about is getting her essay in . It 's like she 's switched off , or something . Do you think she 'll be OK ? I ... I dunno . Here 's great . All right . First , check we 're alone . You look up there , I 'll look down here . We lost the manuscript . No , you listen ! Tell me what 's going on ! Are they infecting people , are they ? Stop lying , that 's bullshit . Look , I need to see you . Tomorrow morning , 6.15 . I 'll send you my location . I 'm in trouble . All right ? Yeah . It says here Pergus were a small-time processed food company up until 1993 . Then , suddenly , they started buying subsidiaries in Europe , Africa , South America - they 're everywhere . All right . What happened in ' 93 ? Er ... A new CEO . Lane Monroe . Shit ! Lane . 'L ' . Is that Mr Rabbit ? What , him ? ! Fuck it , I 'm gonna get his address . Oh , maybe I 'll have a look for my dad . You know , he would have p ... Don 't ! No , it 's a perfect opport ... We can 't risk . Yeah ? What 's this ? I lied . I did keep a piece . Kevin Baig , resident of Fetlar , listed dead from Russian Flu , Thursday the 14th . This says he was poisoned by chromic potassium sulphate . I want Anya released . It 's the child . Christ , it 's the child . I should 've known . I 've copies with lawyers . Sealed , they don 't know what it is , but they know to send it to press if I don 't phone in every two hours . Do you know how stupid you look ? Don 't do this , Michael , come on . We will wreck your life , we will do so much dam ... Release Anya . Yes , well , we 're not going to do that . You 're proving yourself surprisingly unpredictable . We need collateral . So we can 't release her , can we ? What does surprise me is that , given you know what we are capable of , you still seem to think you can negotiate . Now , obviously , we can 't hurt you physically , because of your supposed lawyers . So ... Is that Jen ? Mm-hmm . If you hurt her , I 'll have nothing to lose , you remember that ! Alexi , give us a wave . Alexi has a folder . It contains photos of you and Anya fucking , of course - dates , times , a scan of your baby and a rather lurid DVD . Give me everything you have by 8pm or he will hand it to your wife . You see , there are lots of grades of hurt we can do to a life . And we have the will to inflict them all . 'Have they seen you ? ' Milner ? Jesus , is that you ... ? 'Have they seen you , yes or no ? ' No , no , they haven 't . 'I 'm sending in a distraction , get out of there now . ' Milner , I 'm sorry , I just ... Do you think this is a fucking game ? Is that it , you stupid ... No , no I don 't ! I 'm sorry . Sorry ? They have your families staked out ! You were picked up three times on facial recognition - if I hadn 't managed to intercept it , you and your brother would be dead ! What kind of risk do you think that puts me in ? I just wanted to see him ! I 've had a team on you all morning . They have no idea what this is . I don 't know how I 'm going to explain that little sideshow . Why is there a message on my phone from you about Jessica Hyde ? She had a gun to my head . I thought she was setting you up . You lost the manuscript . How ... how do you know ... ? I 'm a spy . It 's , sort of , the point of what I do . What 's interesting is the person who took it still has it . That means we have a chance . We 're a mess ! The others are worse than me , we 're not up to this ! Well , you bloody well have to be ! Look , Carvel finished Janus before he died . He wrote it into the manuscript . So it 's in the manuscript ? Yes . Whatever Janus does or is , it 's in those pages . I think I know what it is . We figured some stuff out . Good God , is that the manuscript ? I read it . There 's a boy . They torture him . He has one comfort . A sweet . Chocolate raisins . You lied . That boy is long gone ! They ripped everything from you , even your name . You think you 're called Arby . But it 's not a name , it 's initials - RB . " Raisin Boy " . It 's what they called you when they forgot who you were . I 'm all you have , Arby ... Where is Jessica Hyde ? If I see anyone else there , I 'll kill them . And destroy this . What was my name ? Pietre . Your name was Pietre . You might be right , Ian . Monroe ran secret nerve agent research for the CIA before Pergus . He 's network , definitely . But for now , it 's all about the manuscript . There are several parties searching for it . Jessica will be the one who finds it . What makes you think she 'll come back to us ? Where else does she have to go ? You 'd better get back . Don 't tell your friends about this thing with Roy . They need to believe in you . You 're doing well , Ian . " Raskolnikov desires the power of life over death . " He kills the old woman " because he decides that the world is better off without her . " But really he wants to discover what it 's like to end a life . " He deduces that killing the human " is right in the pursuit of a higher cause . " Yeah . Yeah , that 's great , Alice . Reckon that 'll be an A , definitely . So you found out where Monroe lives ? Yeah , we did . We need to go . With respect , I don 't think you 're thinking straight . We go . We find Monroe , and we see if he 's got Chinese character for a rabbit carved on ... Then what ? We whack him ? ! He 's right . We go . Sick of waiting for people to save us . So she kissed you ? On the mouth ? Did you kiss her back ? Becky , she had a gun to my head ! Did you enjoy it ? Well , I suppose she 's attractive . In a kind of skinny-bitch , evil , murderess kind of way . Are you Becky ? Yeah , I am . I 'm Alice . Get in . I want the manuscript . And you are going to take me to it . Of course . That 's why I 'm here . There 's your dispatch of vaccine . We agreed you 'd do the testing . I 've arranged for a car , it 's waiting downstairs , to take you to the lab . So one of us nips in the garage , goes up , breaks in and forces Monroe to buzz the rest up . Which one of us ? He 's an old white dude ? Who 's he gonna be more scared of ? You look like a psycho pirate . Yeah ... Where are we going ? Up there ... See the prick that did this to us . What the fuck is he doing ? ' .. but , according to Jarrod , 'no-one around can remember a time when the crop 'was this bad . 'Many are saying , if the rains don 't come soon , they 're finished . 'But , for some , it is already too late . ' Is it money ? Do you want ... Get up ! You need to open the garage door . My friends want to talk to you . Oh , no , no . All right , listen . I have done everything that you asked , all right ? Let them in . Now . All right . All right , all right . OK . Don 't do this , OK . I have been loyal . You haven 't done what we asked . What ? I did ! I did everything . What did you do ? You did nothing . The GCHN1 protein is everywhere ! I made sure it was everywhere , what more do you want ? All right . All right ! OK . You 're not them ? Surprise . Come on . Move ! All right , all right . You stay in there and whatever you hear , don 't come out . Fuck ! Well , if he 's not Mr Rabbit let 's just leave . He knows something , he 's talking about ... Grant ? What about my essay ? It 's late , we need to get it in . Ain 't gonna happen , Alice . Alice ... Your mum ... Is it him ? In there ? He did this ? What 's the GCHN1 protein ? Please ... I 'm not ... Look , I am no-one . I was doing what I was told . Why don 't you answer the question ? Oh ! Ow ! What the fuck are you doing ? It was a protein that we bred into foodstuffs , OK ! A modification of corn . We bred a corn with a softer husk . It could be broken down , used in animal feeds . It saved farmers billions , everyone wanted it . What does the protein do ? Do ? It doesn 't do anything . It contains a modified amino acid that helps with the softening process , but it 's not necessary for it . The amino acid is absorbed harmlessly into the body . So you went through all that trouble to get this amino acid in food and it does nothing ? Look .. I 'm just a cog . I was paid ! I was just doing what I was told . Who is Mr Rabbit ? Christ , I don 't know that ! Who do you think I am ? Do you know about Janus ? You know that name ? If you 're a cog , then how come you know about Janus ? That 's my dad . Becky , that 's my dad . So what ? They killed him ? They killed Dad ? Wilson ... I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . No , no , no ! Wilson , no ! Wilson .. Wilson , don 't . You said he was alive ! You sat down with me and you said he was alive ! I had to ... We couldn 't risk it . Did you know about this ? You 're supposed to be my friends ! We are , we are ! You 're not ! None of you ! You lied ! No , please ... They killed him . They killed him . Wilson , leave it . The concierge knows I 'm here . If I don 't answer that , he 'll come up ! Wilson ? We need him to answer . Grant and Alice are here . Please ... It 's all right . Come on . Whoever it is , get rid of them . Send them up . You fucking little shit ! Right , you ! Move ! Grant ? Point that at his legs . If he moves , shoot his knees off . Fucking , yes ! Monroe , it 's Letts . Conran Letts . Jesus Christ , what are we going to do ? Monroe ? Hold this a sec . You and I need to talk . Monroe ! Open the door ! He killed my mum , Becky . Jesus Christ ! What do we do ? Ian ? We go ... now . And we take him with us . OK .

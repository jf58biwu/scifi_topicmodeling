 1x08 - Going Dutch [ music plays ] [ paint hisses ] [ sighs ] Hey , Dutch . Whoa , whoa . Personal space , Texas . I thought we talked about this . Oh , yeah , yeah . You did say something . I don 't wanna mess up your flow and junk . [ deep breath ] So , what you gonna paint there ? Like a snake ? A dragon ? I don 't know what I 'm gonna paint . Nothing 's flowing these days . 'Cause a dragon shooting some lasers out of its eyes would be pretty awesome . Pew ! Pew , pew ! You should totally do that . Right . I 'll keep that in mind . Or maybe some lasers shooting dragons out of their laser eyes ! You know ? So , uh , is there something you need ? Oh , yeah . Glad you reminded me . Is my energy " Bolo-ma " finished yet ? Sweet . - The Bolo bumper looks awesome . - I wouldn 't say awesome . Not the way I want it to be . Not sure how to get it there . Oh , tiny man , I 'm sure it 's good enough . As good as it 's gonna get . [ engine revs , tires screech ] [ sighs ] Let 's try this again . [ loud crash ] [ engine revs ] Dragons with laser beam eyes . Think about it ! [ music plays ] [ siren blares ] Jacob : We 're under attack ! [ sighs ] [ engines revving ] [ beeping , whirring ] Hey , Bolo bumper ! [ engines rev ] Whoa ! Hey , Dutch , I think you might 've been right about that Bolo bumper . [ tires screech ] - Heads up . - I see ' em . Mike : All right , let 's swing back and grab Roth . Dutch , have fun with those repairs , buddy . Dutch : Doesn 't anybody else know how to use a wrench ? [ explosion , whirring ] Looks like you got a little too close to the action on that last mission . Come here , man . Hey , Dutch , when you get a chance , Nine Lives could use a tune up . I 'm on it as soon as I can get ... Oh , and Mutt 's gonna need her suspension system aligned . - Right , just gotta ... - Whoa , I was first . Dutch has to fix my energy Bolo bumper . Then gotta get to work on that dragon with the laser eyes we talked about . Really ? Still with the laser eyes ? Pew ! Pew , pew ! Hey , Texas , I think Jacob needs some help in the kitchen with some taste testing . Oh , all over that . Sorry , Dutch , can 't stand around all day drawing with you , got important stuff to take care of . Pew . Pew , pew . Look , man , I know you didn 't come down here just to fix cars and build energy Bolo bumpers . That 's not it . You know I love being a Burner . It 's just that sometimes being a Burner ... Gets in the way of other things . I know . Lately , it 's like I 'm losing my edge or something . You 've been working hard . We all have . Get away for a while . Recharge your batteries . Work on your stuff . Not just our energy Bolos . Yeah , well , I 'm getting kind of sick of the energy Bolo . Don 't blame ya . I 'm sick of saying " energy Bolo . " No go grab some alone time . Clear your head . But what if Kane tries something ? Oh , if he does , we 'll give you a shout . Now go before Texas comes back . All right , buddy . Pack your travel charger . Looks like we 're getting some R R. [ music plays ] [ tires screech ] [ laugter ] Tooley ! Don 't play with that ! Mr. Kane , I 'm sorry . You scared me . Tooley , you have to be very , very careful with these little party poppers I had the science division cook up . Party poppers ? I got a little surprise party planned for those squatters down in the sewers . Party ? And when the party 's over , Motorcity will be mine . What kind of party , Mr. Kane ? Will there be cake ? Will it be a lot of fun ? [ laughs ] Fun ? Oh , it 's going to be fun , all right . [ chuckles ] [ laughs ] Wait ! Mr. Kane ! You forgot to tell me what ... Oh , yeah . You can 't tell me . It 's a surprise . [ laughs ] I 'll need to find it myself . [ robot squeaks ] Dutch : What am I doing ? Telling a story . Just like these cats . But this is my story . [ music plays ] [ muffled yelling ] [ music plays ] Mmm , not bad , huh ? Okay , so what 's next ? Now where does Dutch keep the oil filters again ? Hey , Chuck ? Remind me not to use Mutt as a battering ram . I did and you didn 't listen . Oh , it 's cool , guys . We can use this . This way , we won 't mess up our cars anymore . - Really ? - And why do we keep him around again ? Oh , come on ... [ siren blares ] [ garbled dialogue ] Burners ! We need your help ! I don 't know if we can hold out ! [ choking ] All right , button up your rides , and Chuck , get Dutch on the com . Tell him to meet us on the road . Way ahead of you , but I can 't get a hold of him . Keep trying from Mutt . We gotta move now . Mmmm , how ' bout you try moving that over there . [ whines ] - You 'll be okay ? - [ squeaks ] Watch out for those magnets , man . They can burn out your circuits if you 're not careful . Not feeling it . Whoa ! We 've be down here for two days ? Feel kind of guilty for ditching the gang for so long . But , man , it 's good to just freestyle again . All right , let 's pack up and head home . I know there 's something cool to this stuff , just can 't seem to figure out how it should all go together . [ music plays ] [ engine rumbles ] Where is everyone ? Seems kind of empty out here . Hey , guys , you got your ears on ? I 'm on my way in . Anything going on that I should know about ? Wow . Can you check our gear and do a signal boost ? Nothing at all ? On any frequency ? [ poppers whirring ] That can 't be good . Dutch : This has got to be a joke . Come on , guys . You can come out now . Man . I wasn 't gone long enough for the whole world to fall apart . Status , cam feeds , com recordings . [ beeping ] What ... what was that ? If we can 't come up with a plan soon , Motorcity 's in deep trouble ! Just in case . - Julie : What 's that ? - Texas : Goin ' in . Mike : No ! Don 't get in your car . [ Chuck whining ] - Julie : No ! No ! No ! - Nooo ! Locate Burner vehicle beacons . Let 's go find our pals . You with the scout team ? Yes . Scout team . All right . Add on in . Hey ! Don 't forget your suit . - Can 't wait for the fun to start . - Tooley : Me neither . [ engine revving ] Coming up on the Burners' last known position . Hope they 're alright . Oooh , there they are ! Hey , do you know what 's going on here ? I 'm looking for my friends . [ roaring ] Whoa ! Uh ... you know what ? Uh ... never mind . We 'll just let you get back to being all creepy and oozy and well , just ... heh , run ! [ roaring ] [ yells ] Get off of me ! I don 't know what you Kane Co . punks did to those people , but you 're not doing it to me . Is that the way you treat the guy who just saved your butt ? - Mike ! - Easy , buddy . Easy . Wha ... where are the rest of the Burners ? What happened out there ? Ugh . Motorcity was under attack , but we didn 't know by what . Didn 't find any of the usual bot suspects . But we ran into some KaneCo. guys in hazmat suits . Then we got jumped by our friends out there . Something was changing them . I got separated from the other Burners . Ugh ! I should 've seen this coming . You should 've known Kane was gonna release some sort of crazy virus thing ? Yeah , right , come on , man . None of this makes any sense . So how do we fix this mess before we all turn into drooling freaks ? Already got someone on it . Hey Jacob , how 's that antidote of yours coming ? Still working on it . Hitting some road blocks , but think I can make it to ' em . [ Dutch yells ] Call you back . [ roaring ] [ cackling ] [ both gasp ] [ screaming , roaring ] - Oh , man ! - Come on ! We can 't help them if we get infected . We gotta move ! [ roaring ] Hello ? Hello ? ! I guess everyone must be at the party . [ electricity crackling ] [ both panting ] [ moaning ] [ loud rip ] Mike ! [ grunts ] That 's gonna be a problem . Dutch ? You have to get that cure . - You 're gonna have to leave me behind . - Not gonna happen . [ screams ] [ all yelling ] Not giving you a choice , pal . [ yells ] Okay , gang , how about we try a little team-building exercise today . [ yells ] [ whirring ] [ roaring ] Pa-pa-pa party time is now and now is party time ... what ? [ moaning ] Hey ! Hey , mister ! You know where the party is ? [ moaning , hissing ] [ roars ] [ yells , laughs ] [ yells ] [ tires screech ] Come on Roth , almost there . [ tires screech ] At least we 're safe now . Yo , Jacob ! Is the antidote ready ? Jacob ! We need that antidote now ! The guys are all zombies ! Where are you old timer ? Man ! Am I glad to see a friendly face ! [ moans ] [ yells ] Or not ! So I 'm guessing you didn 't get too far with that cure , huh ? [ roars ] [ screams ] Nice form . That Tai-Chi or something ? Come on , old man . Let 's wrap this up before you hurt yourself . [ moans , yells ] Roth ! Here ! [ electronic zombie screech ] Roth ? Sir ? Our scout teams are not reporting in , but the chaos virus is sure to have infected most of the city by now . Those bottom feeders should all be quite out of their minds and unable to form any kind of focused defense . Move in . Take Motorcity . How is this even possible ? Why would the virus infect you ? Unless ... oh , man . The virus is messing with human brains and bot A.I.s. [ electronic roar ] Oh , what ? [ roars ] [ loud crash ] No , no , no , no ! [ yells ] [ grunting ] Oh , man ! Sorry , buddy . It 's for your own good . [ electricity crackling ] Oh ! [ powering down ] Nanites . Jacob 's cure wouldn 't have worked anyway . Nanites are just tiny machines . And machines are my specialty . I can beat this ! - One down ... - [ whirrs ] [ roaring ] Whoa ! Way too many to go ! - [ whirrs ] - No , no , no . I don 't think we should go with the screwdriver cure . We need just a plan . Mmm , plan , plan . Plan ! Oh , that 's it ! [ moans ] [ yells ] [ whirrs ] [ roaring ] Roth , get me to the magnet . Ugh . Not much time left . Now let 's see if this crazy plan will work . Come on , Roth . [ whirrs ] [ electricity crackling ] It worked ! [ whirring ] All right , buddy , let 's get to work . [ all moaning ] [ music plays ] Ready to make one last run , pal ? [ whirrs affirmatively ] [ roaring ] [ engine revs ] [ music plays ] [ roaring ] Mike : I knew you could do it , buddy ! I had some help . Oh , man ! What 'd you do to my ride ? And why do I have a shiner ? Sorry about that . Dude , I had no idea old people could move so fast . Remind me to never pick a fight with you again . That 's right . What 's he talking about ? I told ya , dragons with laser eyes are the bomb . [ laughs ] You were right , man . [ loud whirring ] - Uh , guys ? - Julie : Kane 's troops . They probably think everybody 's zombied out . Bet they 're expecting an easy win . Let 's prove them wrong . Hey ! You guys just missed the party ! Well , I hope you had your fun , boys , 'cause now it 's our turn . [ engine revs ] [ gasps ] [ engine revs ] [ beeping ] Mr. Kane ! That surprise party was awesome ! Tooley ... There were costumes and games and a dragon ride . - And I made a lot of new friends . - Not now , Tooley ! Maybe next time you can come to the party too ! Party time is now . [ music plays ] - Got your edge back , huh ? - You could say that . But I don 't think I 'll be needing any more alone time . A break is fine and all , But that was kind of crazy . I don 't know , that was a pretty great save back there . Seems like a little time off inspired you . Thanks , but , you know , I think I got all the inspiration I need right here . No need to thank me , girls . I even inspire myself sometimes . In fact , I just whipped this up . Wait for it , look at it . It 's got jets , turbo drills , circular saws ... - I 'll cover for you . - Right . See you in a couple of weeks . ... a swiss-army knife , and over here , hydraulics ... [ tires screech ]

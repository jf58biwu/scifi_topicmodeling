 Ponds . Me again . Sorry about the gaps in communications . Dropped your Ood back home . Reconnected it to the hive mind . Helmic regulator 's still not working . Got hit by an arrow at Hastings Hill . Also , rode a horse through 11th-Century Coventry . Also , I think I may have accidentally invented pasta . Ah ! Mmm ... I popped ' round but you were out , which is fine . Everything 's all right , isn 't it ? With you two ? Of course it is . Ponds , always fine . Just worrying unnecessarily . Anyway , just call me if you need me . Okay ? Toodle Pip ! Message deleted . We need you , Raggedy Man . I need you .

 I thought we could talk . I got you your favorite wine . - Half empty . - Half full . And some glasses . And ... Okay . You brought confusing underwear back from Italy , Mel . It 's Melissa now . Okay ? And this is from Paris . She hit the tarmac 45 minutes ahead of schedule , sir . Well , then now is not the time for your sister to go AWOL . I got worse news than that . Confirmation of chatter over the aerospace channels . Well , son , tell me what I 'm looking at . Meteor . It 's headed for the Eastern Seaboard . How big is this bastard ? Seven klicks wide . It 's a ten on the Torino scale . Planet killer . Damn kids . Hold on . Hold that thought . - Okay . - One second . Holding that thought . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , get away from the van . Go . Go across the street or something . Still no public address from the White House . Front of house , it 's just another day at the Oval Office . So we 're still ahead of the sheep ? Yeah . Hold on . In the background , military and government comm traffic is peaking . Dad , they know . Of course , they know . They don 't want people to panic . You start telling people now . We start bugging out now . - What 's wrong , babe ? - It 's my dad and his damn drills . Time to actually take me home , champ . Some things never change . Marcus freaking King . Really ? Okay , I 'm not going anywhere near your crazy dad . That 's for damn sure . His gang of doomsday preppers are still the same paranoid whack jobs . I 'm sorry , Caden . We 'll pick up where we left off . Here . Thank you , darling . And I do promise . Yeah , we 'll pick up where we left off . Come on . We 've got to move . I 'm going as fast as I can . Okay , pass me those two boxes there . Missy , you do love to take your sweet time . You cost us 29 minutes . You 're riding shotgun . Let 's go . Late to the show , and you still get the best seat in the house . Is he serious about this ? Dead serious . Okay . Was that fancy pants ' creepy van I saw pulling away ? Talking about Caden is out of bounds . So that 's why I got negative response from you , Melissa . Well , Mom didn 't pry like this . You never change . Paris changed me . Ain 't gonna be Paris in 90 minutes . Presidential address here , guys . Check this out . Turn it up . My fellow Americans , I 've just been informed of a comet tracking to hit Pennsylvania within the hour . NASA is advising everyone to take to basements and fallout shelters for safety . A lot of good that 's gonna do . You know , a meteor that size is gonna hit PA with the force of a dozen nukes . Half a continent away , basement shelters aren 't gonna be worth a damn . Let 's see what the Air Force has to say . Will Cheyenne be able to withstand that ? In theory , it will hold , sir . Lock down the north and south blast doors . Prepare to seal the exhaust outlet . Geoff , where the hell have you been ? - I need you for lockdown . - Ask Missy . Hey , no time for finger pointing . Let 's go . Let 's go . - Sir , yes , sir . - Move it . I 'm here , baby . Not the time , lovebirds . You know , you 're as late for the real thing as you are for the drills . - Smart-ass . - Yeah . Let 's go , Tyler . Let 's go . - Hey , Marcus . - What 's up ? The Franklins aren 't here yet . What do you mean they 're not here ? I mean , we can 't lock down without them . They got two thirds of the weaponry . I know . Where are those damn junk dealers ? Their kid 's already here . Damn it . They 're in Florida . I forgot all about it . That 's why Tyler 's by himself . - Go see how much we have . Go , go , go , go ! - Got it . We 're gonna be fine with the guns we 've got . We gotta lock it down before we get swarmed . Mom , stop ! Mom ! Please , stop , Mom . - Thank you . - Come on , guys . Let 's go , let 's go ! - Make sure they get inside . - All right , we got it . - Come on . Let 's go . - Come on , guys . Geoff . My God . We don 't have the space for these people . - Get inside with your mom , babe . - Like hell . Wait ! - Wait ! - Caden ! Wait ! Wait ! Cover me . - My God ! - We 're out of time . Everyone inside now ! Get down . Come here . - Matt ! - Hey , Dad , stop it ! No , you 're going . We 're locked down . That 's an order . Now get going ! There 's only enough rations for us . - They 're coming . - We can 't help them . Dad ! - Open fire ! - That 's my neighbor . That 's an order ! - That was my kindergarten teacher . - Fall back ! Nic ! - Dad ! - Your dad will follow ! No . No ! - Dad ! - Marcus , come on ! Seal it up ! Seal it up now ! Wait for us ! Initiating lockdown . Caution . Initiating lockdown . Caution . Lockdown sequence in five , four , three , two , one . Hatch has sealed . Lockdown complete . No ! No ! Dad ! Dad ! Damn it . How many times have I told you this is not a half-pipe ? Get your deck out of the courtyard . The secondary cells are not holding a charge . FOOD RATIONS - We 'll never have a baby . - We 'll keep trying . A few more years shall roll A few more seasons pass And we shall be where suns are not A far serener clime Hang on ! That one wasn 't so bad . Move . Warning . Failure . Power levels , critical . Warning . This is not a drill . Go ! Control room . Go ! Let 's go . - Move ! - Go , go ! Keep them calm . Warning . Power system failure . Warning . Initiate backup power system . - Calm ! - We 're gonna fix it , okay ? Calm down . It was just another tremor . It 's okay , Xeni . My brother 's got this . Madsie . In there like swimwear . Thank God . Sitrep . Main solar array is down . No data . I need eyes up there . We gotta crack the hatch this time , Mads . I 'll go . - Me too . - Me too . Me too . Not this again . Missy , we don 't have a read on what 's happened yet . What more do we need a read on ? Without solar , I mean ... Without that , we lose aeroponics and all our major systems , which means no water , no power , and in three days , no clean air either . But what went wrong , Geoff ? There is no way to tell that from down here . You know that . Not since we lost Camera Six last year . She 's right . We 've got to crack the hatch this time . I 'm taking Geoff , Rogan , and Shaina in a four-man team . - Five . - Six . You 'll do nothing of the kind , soldier . - Madsie . - No ! Who the hell do you think you are ? I 'm the ranking officer . Rank ? Look at all the crap that I give about your rank . - Hold on there , Missy . - Not now , G. You finally want your father 's job , little girl ? Come and take it . I 've been waiting to put you in your place for a long time , you insolent little ... Now is your chance to try , old man . Come on , you guys , stop . Mads , calm down ! Do you yield ? Do you yield ? Yes , I yield . Anybody else ? Anybody else ? Melissa will take a team topside for maintenance . Volunteers only . Here , this camouflage will deflect and insulate you against the radiation we 'll encounter topside . It 's your lifeline if you 're looking to avoid cancer and to keep your guts working . For everything else we 'll encounter topside , there 's this . The other lifeline . All right , grab your weapons . Move out . Bye . Check on Uma while you 're topside , will you ? Don 't worry . I know what she means to you . I am worried about you being up there . Mom . Just be careful . I 'm gonna be fine . Take this with you . I love you so much . I love you . Code accepted . Caution . Initiate exit sequence . Promise to take care of Nicole . I will . She means the world to me . Caution . Main hatch activated . - Team ready ? - Ready , sir . Caution . Main hatch activated . No ! Don 't ! Come off it , G. I 'd rather die of radiation poisoning than spend one more minute down there . That 's fresh air ? More or less . It 's not entirely deadly , but I 'd hardly call it fresh air . I don 't remember it at all . Breathe deep , Xeni . The main array should be over here . Geoff , Tyler , take point . Come on . Rogan , take six . I 'm coming . Blood pressure normal . Heart rate normal . There . That last tremor knocked the solar panel off the silo . Silo Actual , this is Away Team topside , over . Silo Actual . Sitrep . Yeah , we found the problem . Solar Array Three has been compromised . Let me see what I can do . Stand by . AWAY CAM It 's froze . Come on . Jeez . Okay , try it now , Mads . You getting any power ? Affirmative . 65 % power . SILO POWER 64 % CAPACITY Scratch my last . 64 % power . Two thirds and falling ? Even with the diesel we can stabilize for the generators , we 'll be empty within a week . That 's a problem . Well , now that we 're out here , let 's go find a solution . What did your pain-in-the-ass sister just say ? We need power . Now that we 're out in the world , I 'm taking Uma hunting . You tell her ... They 've been cooped up down here for ten years . - God ! - She needs this . They all do . Permission granted . Volunteers only . Any volunteers ? I wasn 't sure about those Faraday cages , Mads , but Uma , she 's purring like a kitten . Great to hear it . Bring her back in one piece . Well , it looks like we 're staring down the barrel of some erratic weather patterns and some unpredictable microclimates . It 's nothing the old gal can 't handle . Sitrep , Geoff . How 's it looking out there ? Temperatures are well below normal . It 's not an ice age , but it 's close . There 's absolutely nothing out here for miles in any direction . It 's actually so beautiful . They should have sent a poet . Yeah , well , write me a haiku , will you ? Just stay sharp out there . We 're gonna check this out , Mads . You seeing this ? Barely . Where the hell are you ? Hold . Hold . Hold ! Uma - Get up ! - Is everyone okay ? Away Team , you there ? We had a big tremor here at the bunker . You feel that ? You getting this , Mads ? Levels are spiking . - You okay ? - I got her , man . I got her . Sitrep . Geoff , sitrep . Is it clear ? - Is everyone okay ? - What the hell are those things ? Keep your eyes open . - Found the source of the radiation . - What is that ? These animals , they 're ... What is that ? - Don 't get too close , Geoff . - What is it ? Oh , my God . Geoff , what is it ? Mads , are you getting this ? What in the name of ... What is it , Geoff ? - These aren 't animals . - What ? Watch yourself , Mel . What is that ? Geoff , what in the hell is going on out there ? They 're people ? Mutated people . With high enough doses of radiation they should all be dead . I 'd say they ought to be dead . Looking pretty dead now . You idiot . The radiation should have killed them , not the bullets . Yeah , it should have , but it didn 't . Geoff , sitrep . It 's not safe here . We should just go back home . No one said it was going to be safe , Xeni . Are you un-volunteering ? No . No , no , no , sir . Good , ' cause back home they 're running out of power by the minute . All right , everyone . Back into Uma . Stay sharp . It 's not safe . - I ripped my jacket . - I 'll fix it for you . Amateurs . Let me know what 's going on , people . Come on . Geoff , adjust your camera . Geoff , I 'm not hearing you . You 're gonna make a great mom someday . Thanks , Xeni . I hope I can . So do I. Mel , why are the only men in my life either brainless ogres or emotional imps ? Ten years in that silo , the pickings are slim . I guess a decade of my dirty laundry being aired doesn 't help . In a space that cramped , there are no closets to hide skeletons . I mean , everybody knows everybody 's business . Look at poor Rogan and Shaina . Yeah , I know . And your brother 's heart is in the right place , but he just has to accept that I 'm with Tyler now . Have you ? Missy , I really think we need to address this radiation issue . What 's on your mind , G ? With the sun down , radiation levels have spiked . We either need to find shelter or some iodine pills . Yeah , that 's a great idea , but we ran out of those eight years ago . Maybe if someone 's family hadn 't left our radiation meds behind . So now you want to blame my mother . Enough of this . Enough of that . We 'll be at the old Franklin junkyard by sunup . Barometric pressure is plummeting . We 've got a storm coming in . Stay sharp . Good hunting . We 're gonna need those medical supplies . - Roger that . - Let 's go . EAGLE HEAD AUTO PARTS REPAIR AUTHORIZED VEHICLE RECYCLING CENTRE FREE PICK UP OF ANY UNWANTED / SCRAP VEHICLES - Ty , you don 't have to go in , you know . - Why wouldn 't I ? This is my home . No , it 's not . Not anymore . It 's okay , hon . I 'm gonna be fine . Okay , Tyler knows this place better than any of us , so he 's leading Team One with Nicole . Nicole , tell us what we 're after . Iodine in any form , ideally as tablets or pills , but we 'll take whatever we can find , wherever we can find it . Refrigerators can survive a nuclear blast , so my father had dozens of reserve medical stashes in household appliances , even microwaves and washing machines , all over this place . Well , a bunch of them are bound to have been raided already , so let 's find the ones that haven 't been . The Franklins were ... Are a very crafty family . Shaina , take Rogan and Xeni . Geoff , you 're with me . Let 's fan out . Situation report . Remember your training . You know , you asses need to sort out your business . It 's not my fault your ex is making moves on you . My ex was saving my life because my current was unloading his A-K like a damn fool . Yeah , but I was trying to help ... Move it , Ty . Where 'd that come from ? Six o 'clock . You mean something 's behind us ? Move . Multiple targets . - Thirty feet and closing . - On my mark . Guys ! Move . Move ! Go , go , go . Tyler ! Nicole ! Help ! Help ! Get off me ! Get back ! - This way . Come on . - Nicole , hang on ! Watch out ! We 've got to get through . Let 's go ! Come on . Over there ! Where are they ? This way . I 've lost you . Speak to me , Geoff . - What the hell was that ? - Mutants . They were hot on our heels . And then they were right in front of us . We just got played . These mutants aren 't dumb animals . Unlike some . They 're gone . No , they 're not . No ! No ! Please help ! Help ! No ! Nicole ! Hey , can you shoot better than Mel and her two best pupils ? - No . - Neither can I. You got Nicole . I got Tyler . Go . Nicole , Nicole , talk to me , girl . What do I have to do here ? You 're the medic . Knife . Get a knife . Knife . I need a knife . Okay . All right , knife . Knife . Now what ? Now what ? Cut my throat right there . No ! No ! Shut up . You 're going to be fine . I just need to stop the bleeding . She 's not gonna make it . Shaina , just give me some space . Please , it hurts so bad . I gotta say you 've got a really funny way of dealing with boy trouble . Glad I never took your advice . In hindsight , I don 't recommend this . Bad idea . Mel , give this to my mom . Tell her ... Tell her that Daddy and I will be waiting . - Please . - No . Please , Mel . Please . No ! God . Sorry , Geoff . Sitrep . Tyler ? He 's gone . I can 't hear you , soldier . He 's gone . We need to gather their gear and their rations , and then we 're gonna bury them here , in Tyler 's home . A few more suns shall pass O 'er these dark hills of time And we shall be where suns are not A far serener clime There 's nothing for us in this place . Let 's get the hell out of here . Come on , G. - Geoff ! - Geoff ! Ambush ! - Go for cover ! - Cover ! Go ! All right , Xeni , get down ! Where are they ? Do you see them ? I don 't know . We 're surrounded . Get down ! Okay , it 's gonna be okay . Watch out . I don 't got any contacts . Okay . Stay down . Damn it , Missy . - Just like a Band-Aid . - Incoming ! Come here , you ! I have had just about enough of this . - Any of you ugly bastards move , and I 'll ... - Well , well . You are certainly prettier than most mutants . The name 's Francois . The pleasure is all mine . You 're human . You 're all human . Human . Human enough to know a pretty lady pointing a loaded 12-gauge at my face . I haven 't seen the end of either one of those in years . Well , if you 're going to be civilized , then I can stop showing you this end . Would you like that ? Situation report . That 's just my radio . I have to let my friends know not to shoot you , so I 'm gonna do that , okay ? Stand down . They 're friendlies . That 's not how I remember friendlies . Well , it has been ten years . Friendlies ? Humans , at least . They have survived an apocalyptic meteor strike , mutant attacks , food shortages , and God knows what else . It 's cost us too much already to turn back now . The folks back at base are running out of power fast , and then they 're as good as dead . They are counting on us for a solution . And I am on it . Lower your weapon . Now . Well met , new friends . " Well met , " he says ? It is not about how a meeting begins . It 's about how it ends . That 's easy for you to say . Yours didn 't begin with an arrow in the leg . The deputy and his friends have ... Posse . The deputy and his posse are from a nearby town , and they 've offered us asylum . We have walls to protect you from the mutants . We got diesel to trade . We got a doctor to look at your knee . Geoff , is it ? These damn townies shot me . They should be the ones to fix me . Francois got here in a day on foot . If we all pile into Uma , I can get you there by sunset . Uma ? Uma . Mads , we found some humans alive . Follow me . Incredible , Geoff . They 're taking us to their town . Roger that . I want status reports regularly . - You running as low as I am ? - Lower . Halfway to Winchester . Not full auto . Yeah , ammo conservation time . They call these walls , huh ? It 's safer than a junkyard . Well , I 'll believe that when I see it , Shai . All right , Frank , time for the tour of your fair city . And start with the hospital . Open up ! It 's me . Now , you 're gonna want to fetch the sheriff . He 's gonna want to roll out the red carpet . Clear out ! Now ! Melissa ? Melissa King , as I live and breathe . Beverly . You 're alive ! Not many from our school that are . What about Nicole ? Did she make it ? You two were just inseparable . No , she didn 't . Oh , my gosh . Is that your brother ? What happened ? Arrow to the leg . The sheriff is waiting . Let him wait . Don 't you worry , Melissa . I 'll look after him right . - Bring him in here . - All righty . Come on , big boy . He better be okay . Come on . The sheriff 's waiting . Don 't touch me . SALOON Welcome ! Welcome , friends . Welcome to our humble town . Please , avail yourself of our hospitality . Sheriff Elmore Leonard at your service , miss ... Melissa . This is Rogan , Shaina , and Xeni . My brother Geoff is in your infirmary . I 'm told you have diesel to trade . Well , yes , yes , we do , - but first things first ... - No , well , for me , diesel is the first thing . Okay . Warning . Perimeter breach . Mads ! - Intruder alert . - Mads ! Mutants . If they breach , we got trouble . They 've gotten in , Mads . My gun 's jammed . Move . Hold them off ! Sera ! Sera ! Geoff , darling , are you awake ? Can you hear me ? Don 't try and move . You 're tore up pretty bad in the knee . Bev ? Bev , is that you ? Sure as the day is long , sunshine . When the meteor hit , it wrought havoc across the land . Most of us took refuge in basements and such . The impact was destructive , to be sure , but the fires that came afterwards , the looting , and then , of course , came the mutants . The mutants . - What about them ? - Well , you know , some say that the mutants rode on the back of the meteor as though it were a fiery stallion . And others say that the meteor infected our planet with evil . Still others , they say the mutants rose up from hell from where the ground broke open . Right . So which is it ? I believe they are a danger , and I believe that when we have wiped out that danger , the good Lord will allow us to multiply once again . - Multiply ? - Procreate . My dearly departed daughter and Francois here had been trying to make me a grandchild for years . When they 'd finally given up , the Lord saw fit to take her from me . It seems truly impossible . Hold on , no one 's ever gotten pregnant here ? Not a single birth in a decade , not since the mutant scourge fell upon us . It 's not just us . But now , to be blessed by new saviors . Miss , you are truly heaven-sent to bring us such a gift . My God , look at those firearms . Surely , tonight we can rest easy . Indeed . Our guests are here for trade , but they are welcome to stay as long as they like . Although , today will soon be lost , and the night belongs to the mutants . Francois , ready the gates for nightfall . How many arrows did we lose ? We reclaimed three dozen of them for reuse in the morning . Reuse ? Defend your town with a bunch of bows and recycled arrows ? Well , it 's all we have . We 're not so fortunate as you . Mel , do you think we should ... How about this , Elmore ? Since we are here for trade , I 'll give you two of my best shots on guard duty tonight in exchange for diesel , all the diesel that we can carry . Done . Shaina , Rogan , take the nest . What do you think , babe ? What , about the old coot ? No , about what he said . About a curse not letting us have a baby ? Well , little lady , I think he called it a scourge . We 've just spent a decade surviving the biggest natural disaster this world has seen since the dawn of man thanks to science . So , I have a hard time blaming a supernatural scourge for not getting pregnant . Still , there 's hope . Right ? You always give me hope , my love . Always . Now , let 's go wipe out some scourge , sweet cheeks . Aye , aye , little lady . Your sister told me about all your harrowing adventures . Seems you 're quite a hero . Yeah , I ... I took an arrow in the knee . That one had chicken feet . Did you hear that ? They 're crack shots , both of them . I said they 're my best . The people of Asylum are in your debt . Deeply , and I have some thirsty diesel engines that would like to see that debt settled soon , Elmore . Geoffrey , I 've been dreaming of this moment for almost a decade . Me too . Me too . Did you see that head go ? Try to keep up there , sunshine . I 'm just trying to make you look good for the peanut gallery . Rogan ! Rogan ! Xeni ! No ! God ! The mutants are in . Did you hear that ? It 's not the mutants . It 's the townies . Shaina ! I need cover fire ! Shaina ! Follow me . Barricade the door now ! What the hell happened out there ? I could ask the same thing , except I think that you know more than any of us . Mutants . Like I said , mutants . No , her radiation exposure is not like the other mutants we 've encountered . Sure , Bev should be riddled with cancer , but it 's not lethal radiation poisoning . - Who the hell is this ? - Who the hell are you ? - Preacher . - Preacher . Well , Preacher , do you mind explaining what just happened here ? Same radiation , just less of it . Makes ' em plenty a mutant at night . And seeing as it 's night at the moment , I 'd say my initial statement holds true . - Mutants . - So they 'll be fine in the morning ? All except those with no heads or hearts , and just while the sun 's up . Then , it 's this again . So different degrees of exposure makes different degrees of mutation . Brainy boy 's got the notion . That meteor hit a nuclear reactor , and everything in the blast got changed . Anything a little bit deep got a bit less changed . All right . But you still haven 't told us what you 're doing here . I 've been tracking your asses since you left the bunker . Figured you were on your way to Haven . Then you came here instead . I knew the surprise you 'd be in for . Thought I 'd lend a hand . Haven . That 's another town ? Not just a town . Haven . The name 's perfect . No radiation , no mutants , no pirates , no looting . Just west of the mountains . Enough palaver . My throat 's drying out . It 's been a while since I had a flock to watch over . I can do it from here tonight . Hey , Preacher . In case you need it . My name is Melissa . Melissa . How you holding up , G ? I was told what 's left of me is in excellent condition . That 's funny , except your best critic just lost her voice . Yeah . A King never breaks , right ? That 's right . I don 't buy it . She 's not making any sense . Come on , G. You 've got to relax . If the meteor hit the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor , that 's a global catastrophe . - So Haven isn 't real ? - She 's never been there . If she has , why leave Haven ? Well , we left ours . - Now we have to go back . - To the silo ? No . We have no choice . He needs antibiotics . Your fella need ' cillin ? - ' Cillin ? - Yeah , for the leg . Before the rot sets in and it 's got to be cut off . 'Cillin ... Penicillin , yeah . Yeah , he needs antibiotics . For my brother , not my fella . No offense intended . Didn 't ken the resemblance . You 're a mite prettier . Well , ugly as he is , my brother needs antibiotics fast . Might be I got some , if you have something to offer . What do you need ? Your help . I 'm listening . That 's not how I was counting on you using your shotgun , Melissa . This lady here ain 't got your range . I 'm not murdering anyone who 's going to be human again when the sun comes up . Can 't this wait until morning ? You mustn 't ever hold back , Melissa , not ever . Holding back 's for the weak . You may as well be inviting death . These townies are infected , beyond redemption . They 're as good as dead already . So every time you put one down , it 's a mercy . The way I see it , we 're not trapped in Asylum with them . They 're trapped in Asylum with us . Here 's my hospitality , hillbilly . Avail yourself . A few more storms shall beat upon this wild , rocky shore And we shall be where tempests cease and surges swell no more And , O my Lord , prepare My soul for that calm day With a voice like that , you can gather a flock all your own . Yeah , I love singing . I sang in the church choir , but my dad always liked me to have shooting lessons instead of singing lessons . Wouldn 't need lessons in either , in my opinion . Who are you , really ? I ain 't no preacher . Just a woman trying to get past the waste , trying to get to Haven . Dressed like a priest ? I found these clothes looting the stores years ago . I never meant to be an imposter or a heretic . It 's just that people on the road treated me different when I wore this . They respected me , listened to me . They followed me , like I was garbed in hope itself . Until I led my people to this hellhole . I lost my whole damn flock the first night those monsters turned on us . I couldn 't bear to let that happen to yours , so I came back for y 'all . You can 't be hard all the time . My name 's Sadie . Well , Sadie , it is a pleasure to meet you , and I am so grateful that you came back for us . I also came back for this . Haven Actual , this is Preacher . Over . This is Haven Actual . It 's been a while , Sadie . We were getting worried . Come on , now . You know me better than that . Missy , Mads made it , but the walls are breached . Mutants are pouring in . Let 's do it . All right , follow me . Move in , quickly . They should be here . Let 's move . All right . We should be all right here . Gather around the fire . Stay warm . I 'm gonna look around . - All right ? - All right . What ? God . Run for cover ! - Get inside ! - Move it ! You 've come to a very dangerous place , little girl . No ! No , no , no ! Please , no ! No , no ! Here . Live well . No . No ! Mel . Mel ! Caden , is that you ? Stop it . It 's me . It 's Melissa ! Caden , I know you 're in there somewhere . Still want to pick up where we left off , Mel ? Caden , this isn 't you . Please ! I need a little help here . Caden , stop it ! I know you 're in there somewhere ! - Melissa , shoot him ! - Caden ! Shoot it ! No ! No ! Kiss me , Mel . I said , it 's Melissa now . Open it up ! We 're in ! We 're in ! Barricade the doors ! Barricade it ! Easy , easy , easy . I 'm sorry . Sadie , this is all my fault . Got to stay hard at all times . Don 't give up on hope , on Haven . Mads ! Mads ! I 'm down ! I 'm hurt bad , Xeni ! Don 't worry about me ! Get to the truck ! All right , hold . We wait for Melissa 's signal . Hold . Hold ! Come on , Mel . Now , Geoff ! All right , go ! Go ! Now ! Seal them all in , Geoff . Come on . Move aside , soldier . Let me do that ! It 's not moving fast enough , Mads . - Go . - No way . That 's an order ! Mads ! - It 's been an honor , soldier . - Mads . - You 're in good hands . - Mads ! Now , get out of here ! I got this . Geoff , come on ! Geoff ! We can 't let the mutants escape . Fire in the hole ! Gun it , Xeni ! I got all of this . Come to papa . Xeni , gun it ! Go , go ! Haven Actual , this is ... This is the Preacher . I 'm bringing my flock . Guide me in . This is Haven Actual . We 've got a read on your position . A few more struggles here A few more partings o 'er A few more toils , a few more tears Then we shall weep no more And , O my Lord , prepare My soul for that bright day Preacher , this is Haven Actual . Do you copy ? Are you all right ? Do you copy ? Haven Actual , this is the Preacher . We 're fine . We just had some unfinished business to attend to on the road . No way . Hey . How 's my boy ? Dad . Missy . How are you , kids ? I guess you 're not kids anymore . Hi . How are you ... How ... How are you alive ? I don 't know . A few miracles along the way . What did your mother used to say ? - " A King ... " - " ... never breaks . " Yeah . Yeah , maybe ... Maybe she was right , huh ? Well , I see you met Sadie . Yeah . Yeah , she saved our asses . What ? Where is she ? You know , the blast hit , there was a few of us that rode it out in the EMP cages . And I was banged up pretty bad , and that 's where I met Sadie . That 's where I met her . Never gonna forget her . And she , she brought me to Haven . Then she went right to the surface , to the waste , to find more survivors . She wanted to save them . I 'd say she succeeded . I couldn 't help her . I was useless . I was numb . I was feverish . I couldn 't ... Could barely move . So she left me here . Here ? In Haven . Haven . Welcome home . Come on .

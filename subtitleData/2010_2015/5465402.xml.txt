 Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible , inescapable . We 're trapped . We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . - What 's wrong with your mom ? - She 's a diabetic . You want my water , you 'll have to pay for it . Junior locked me in his fallout shelter . Junior 's a cop now . - Who 's gonna believe my word ? - I do . - We 're gonna take what we want . - No ! Hey . Rose is dead . Joe and Norrie touched the dome together . - They 're connected to it . - I 'm offering you my word . Junior Rennie will never touch you again . Dad . Angie ? Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET Joe . Joe . Joe ! Norrie . Hi . Welcome to my room . I want you to come with me to the dome . So we can figure all this out . See how we 're really connected to it . Just because Dodee 's gadget thing beeped at us , doesn 't mean that ... Listen , something happened when we both touched it . It was like we had powers or something . - Don 't you think that 's amazing ? - It 's not exactly the word I 'd use . Well , you should . Let 's go see if we can talk to it or something . See what the dome wants , and convince it to go away . Can I get my pants on first ? Can I watch ? Kidding . No . I 'd like you to stay . They will go away . Harriet . - Hi . - Everything okay ? I 'm sorry , I know it 's early . Do you have any yogurt ? The food mart 's emptied out after the people raided it , and it 's the only thing I can keep down . - Just a month to go , huh ? - Six weeks . Greg 's deployment was gonna be over so he could be home when the baby 's born , but with this thing , I don 't know . Oh , hi . Morning . Barbie , this is my neighbor Harriet . I think I have that yogurt . I 'm sorry . Where are you off to ? Running away ? Half the town going nuts yesterday , that wasn 't a fluke , so Linda could still use my help . I told you last night to stay away from Angie , didn 't I ? I 'm sorry . I went to her room just to talk to her . Please don 't do this . Come on , please , don 't . She ... She can hear . Oh , I 'm embarrassing you ? Huh ? The guy who locks a girl up in a shelter ? I had to . The dome was making her sick . You 're the one who 's sick . - Please don 't say that . - You have to leave . This is my home . Where else am I supposed to go ? Anywhere but here . And if you ever so much as get near Angie , I 'll make you sorry . I promise . Dad , don 't . He is crazy . Well , now he won 't be a problem for either of us . You look tired . I know I am . More than welcome to stay here . You just wanna make sure I don 't tell everyone what Junior did . No . I 'm going home to my brother . After I say goodbye to Rose . Where did , um ... ? Where 's her body ? I don 't know if you heard about Lester Coggins , but no one took over the mortuary since he passed , so Linda had to leave Rose in the Sweetbriar kitchen . What ? I know it 's a shame , but it 's just until she can get buried . Here . I want you to take this and go see her . - You have a key to the diner ? - Well , I 'd better . I own the place . I kept loaning Rose money over the years to keep it open . It just seemed silly after a while , so I bought it . I know that she was your friend too . Say goodbye for both of us . - Thanks again , Julia . - Anytime . Harriet . Honey . Come here . Greg ? You 're really here ? I finally made it home to you , baby . Greg ? Greg ? - Julia . - Harriet ? Julia . Anybody , help me , please . Aah ! I 'm coming , sweetie . I got you . I 'm right here . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just your water breaking . No . It 's too early . I touched the dome . I think it did something to my baby . Something wrong ? You 're the only deputy that bothered to show up today . Where else am I gonna go ? - Junior . - Hey . Anyone else wondering what 's gonna happen next in this town ? Yeah , well , we need to deal with the Dundees . Clint and Waylon killed Rose yesterday . I went by their place last night , but they 're smart enough not to go home . Let 's go track them down . Junior , you stay on patrol . If someone even looks like they 're even thinking of looting , - you shut it down . - Okay , just let him go on patrol . I know the Dundees . I might be able to talk them down without things getting stupid . That 's fine by me . All right , come on . - Okay . - Thank you , Julia . - You thought you saw Greg ? - I did see Greg . He was waving to me . I thought it meant that the dome was gone , and then when I went to him and tried to touch him ... He wasn 't there . I should 've known it was too good to be ... - We should get you to the clinic . - Okay , let 's take my car . - Greg put a hospital go bag in there . - Okay . Let 's go . Rose . Who 's in there ? - Stay away from me ! - Whoa , whoa ! I 'm not gonna hurt you . Wait . You 're Joe 's sister . I 'm Ben . I 'm friends with your brother . Is Joe okay ? Yeah , he 's hanging with his new girlfriend . Seriously , you don 't need to be stabby with me . I just saw the door open and wanted to make sure no one 's wrecking stuff again . Oh , damn . Is that Rose ? Will you help me with something ? Go on , folks , - take all you can carry . - Thank you . That well ain 't running out any time soon . So business is booming . That grin of yours is about to cut the top of your head off . Well , town needed me . And I 'm happy to help . Sure you are . Long as I keep you stockpiled in propane . Just a capitalist . Like you , Jim . But you didn 't come out here to chew the fat with your old pal . No . I came to bury the hatchet . You ? Look , Ollie , we can keep pissing each other off , or we can get things done . Okay ? Now , you got the water . I got lots of propane . We work together , we can get this town here back on track and our friends and neighbors back on their feet . Good old Big Jim . Always thinking of Chester 's Mill . Well , it 's the right thing to do . Still you sure about that propane supply ? - Trust me , it won 't run out . - Oh , I don 't doubt that . But what I 'm asking is are you sure it 's still yours ? What the hell does that mean ? Sure was a nice new dawn this morning , wasn 't it ? Anything ? Yeah . You 're really good at that . From the dome , Joe . Anything from the dome ? I didn 't feel anything , like a seizure . Me neither . Unfortunately . Maybe we 're going about it all wrong . I mean , we 've touched it . We 've talked to it . - Made out on it . - Which was awesome . But every time something has happened , it 's been because we did something different . Joe , I 'm not having sex with you for the first time against the dome . I didn 't mean that . Wait , but you wanna do that ? Focus . I 'm just saying . Maybe we 're trying to get a response from it in the wrong place . Maybe the real action isn 't along the perimeter . Where else would it be ? If the dome is like an atom , and these walls are just electrons , that means there has to be a nucleus in the center of it . - Which could be holding it all together . - Maybe that 's where we should go . You 're smart , Joe McAlister . What the hell is this , Boomer ? You better say you got lost on your way to your damn cornfield . Gonna have to stop you right there , Mr. Rennie . Ollie says no one 's allowed inside but him . - Ollie ? - Yeah . This is my property , I 'll do whatever I please . Them keys ain 't gonna do you any good . Now , look here , Boomer . You get out of my way ... Mouthy townie bastard . So , what happens after we catch Waylon and Clint ? Put them in a cell . Then what ? I mean , county court 's in Westlake outside of the dome . We bring them in , then we figure it out . Dundees can 't just walk free after killing Rose . Or what they were gonna do to Angie . - Wait , Angie was attacked ? - Just so you know , she 's okay . They were gonna rape her . Barbie stopped them , but then they got away . Yeah , they won 't get away this time . - Can you go faster ? - It 's just a few more blocks . What the hell is this ? Sorry , I gotta ... Nobody move ! Or I 'll blow your head off ! My God , what do we do ? - We do exactly what they say . - Shut up ! - You got it ? - I can 't believe we 're being gas-jacked . Car 's not nearly as useful as the fuel . Come on , hurry up . - Waylon , it 's going . - Move . Linda ? Linda , it 's Barbie . I just tangled with the Dundees . Copy . Where ? Try and squeeze my hand . He 's okay . No one 's hurt . He 's okay . We 're at town center . They took off to the northwest . - We 're on it . - She 's going into labor . - We gotta get her to the clinic . - That 's not gonna happen . - Just went by there . It 's closed . - My baby 's coming . Alice . She 's a doctor . She 's staying with Joe McAlister . - We gotta go . - This car 's not going anywhere . Then let 's start walking . Come on . Get her out of there . Let 's go . Where do you think Waylon and Clint are headed ? Not much northwest of town . Except that salvage yard . What , you never played hide-and-go-seek there as a kid ? It 's got lots of old buildings . No one around . If they 're on the run , they 're probably there . - It 's worth a shot . - Yeah . Let 's go kick their teeth in . Like hell . We 're gonna arrest them and read them their rights . - What , seriously ? - We 're not vigilantes , okay ? You only use that gun if your life is in danger . Do you understand ? Yeah , I got it . Whatever you say , sheriff . Do you think we 're getting closer ? About five miles from the wall . We 've been going perfectly southwest . Shouldn 't be too far now . If we ever get out of here , you should consider a career in cartography . Me and Ben mapped the dome on day one . Lucky I paid attention in trig class . If we turn it off , we can get my mom more insulin . How is she ? She 's good , but we 're gonna need more . Joe , do you ever wonder why it picked us ? Sure , but I 'm mainly just glad it did . Excuse me ? I mean , it 's weird and it 's scary , but it 's the first time anything like this has happened on Earth . That 's awesome , in the true " awe " sense of awesome . Not to mention , if it hadn 't come down , I might not have met you . - What 's his problem ? - Truman . Are you okay ? Truman ? - Truman . - He thinks something 's wrong . Should we go back too ? We can 't stop now . We 're close . Man , I 've never buried anyone before . That was messed up . I mean , it was nice . It was nice of you to bury Rose . I never appreciated her . I was always too busy wishing that I was somewhere else . Someone else . We gotta clean this place up . Why don 't you go see if you can find us a mop ? What happened to you ? People making trouble for themselves . I need a drink . Hell , yeah . Chug . Didn 't know you had company , Angie . Ben Drake , sir . We met at one of Junior 's games . - You been talking about Junior ? - No . Clean this blood up . Babe , I told you , I 'm feeling much better . For now . I just don 't wanna act sick until I am sick . - Honey ... - Please ? Your insulin has been so irregular . - It has to be messing with you . - I 'm telling you , I don 't need this . Okay then , badass , get up and dance . I want to . I 'm sorry . For what ? For bringing us here . For insisting that Norrie be sent to that program . I insisted too . And I would follow you anywhere . It is no one 's fault . Alice ? It 's my neighbor Harriet . She 's in labor a month early . Let 's get her on the couch . All right , nice and slow . - Harriet ? - Yeah . - I am Alice Calvert . - Don 't leave . - I 'm not leaving . - You 're gonna be just fine . Actually , you 're gonna have the first baby born inside the dome . Oh , my God . The hair 's standing up on my arms . And there it is . What the hell is that ? It shocked me . You 've gotta be kidding me . - Another dome ? - I think there 's something inside . Ten centimeters . It 's almost time to push . - I can 't do this without my husband . - Harriet . Harriet , listen to me . - This happens every day . - I can 't do this . - You can do this . - This is not every day , Alice . This isn 't right . Bringing someone into a world like this . Harriet , you are gonna be a wonderful mother . Do you remember when we first met ? You showed me the sonogram and you couldn 't contain yourself . There 's no hope with people behaving this way . And it 's only gonna get worse , isn 't it ? With all of us trapped under this thing ? Isn 't it ? - You don 't know that . - Harriet , look at me . Look at me . Good things happened today . Right ? Some people , they 're always gonna show up . Now , we 're here . All right ? We 're not going anywhere , but I 'm gonna need you to show up too . - Okay ? - Okay . - Yeah ? - Okay . Will you hold my hand ? Listen , I got you . Okay ? We all do . Harriet , it 's time to push , on three . You can do this , Harriet . One , two , three . Hey , Jimmy . I hear you had a little run-in with the new security guard at your old propane warehouse . Had worse . I hate to see my old friend sitting here , licking his wounds like a fat-ass cat . So I 'll be brief . Earlier , you said we should be working together . But you see , I got the well . And unless I 'm wrong , I got more crops than you townies , and now I got the propane . So unless you want your beloved Chester 's Mill to starve to death , you 'll toe the line . You see , it 's my turn to have my sweaty hand wrapped around this town 's neck . So from now on , when I say " Jump , " you say , " How high ? " Didn 't I say it was a nice new dawn this morning ? I don 't see anybody , do you ? - What are you so scared of ? - Ah . The guy that kicked your ass yesterday . Almost did it again today . I think he 's a deputy . You know he 's gonna tell Linda . They ought to worry about us , not the other way around . Whole town 's falling apart , Clint . There 's a lot of good opportunities , going forward . Waylon . There 's somebody on your side . Damn , you 're stupid , Clint . Drop them and put your hands where I can see them . Do what he says . Now ! Put your hands behind your head . You 're both under arrest for the murder of Rose Twitchell . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be held against ... Please . I 'll go quietly , please . I 'll go peacefully . Please . Junior ... Got him . Maybe it 's the generator that created the whole dome . Open . Open and turn off . - End program . - It 's not working , Joe . You think ? Hello . - Begin communication . - Who are you talking to ? - Hey , you . Initiate communication . - Maybe it doesn 't like being yelled at . What if we ask nicely ? The big dome responded when we both touched it together and made the radio work again . Okay . Outer space thing , we would like it very much if we could just talk to you . Norrie . Mom ? I need to find my mom . Come on . - Aaargh ! - That 's it . That 's it . That 's great . Okay . Uh-oh . What ? Is something wrong with my baby ? No , you 're fine , sweetheart . Something 's wrong ... - Alice ? - Uh ... - What 's happening ? - Nothing . Everything 's fine , okay ? You gotta keep pushing , all right ? Yes , all right ? Push on three . Ready ? One . - It hurts so much . - Here we go . One , two , three . Push ! Come on ! Aagh ! No ! No ! Okay , okay , okay . Head 's out . Is everything all right here ? - No . No , no , no . You can 't . - I have to . Oh ... Harriet , you need to stop pushing . - I need you to stop pushing . - What ? The cord , it 's wrapped around the baby 's neck . You 're gonna have to walk me through this . - All right ? - You have to cut the cord - so the baby can breathe . - Okay . - Clamp it . - With what ? - A string . - I got it . - A string , yeah . - Somebody help my baby ! Just don 't push yet . - I found shoelaces . - Hurry , hurry , hurry . - Tie it off in two places . - This one . - I got it . - Yeah . That 's it . I got that . I 'm good . You ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Okay , here we go . - Okay . - Great . - All right , cord 's cut . - Okay , Harriet , you can push now . - One last big push . - Come on , one more . - Okay ? On three . - Push now ? One , two , three . Push ! Push , push , push . Oh , ha ! You 've got a beautiful baby girl . - Look at her , look at her . - There she is . - Let 's go see Mama . - Swaddle her up . - She 's beautiful , Harriet . - Oh , my lamb . Hello . Thank you . Thank you . - May I ? - Of course . Shh . That 's good . Oh , yeah . Be careful . - Here she is . There we go . - Oh ! Ooh ! Hi . Alice meet Alice . Thank you . Oh , let 's go back and see Mama . Come here , you . - She 's a little traveler already . - There we go . - Alice ? - Alice ? Alice ? Alice ? - Alice . - Alice , what 's wrong ? - Heart ... - Alice . Oh ... I appreciate your help today , Ben . Hm . What are you smiling about ? I just realized that this is the first time I 've ever worked here and not been pissed off about it . Hi , Angie . Come on , I 'm not gonna bite you . Your dad told you to leave me alone . I just need to tell you something . So you can go home . No , man , I don 't think I will . Um ... I just wanted to tell you that I know I can 't make you love me . That was my mistake . I just want you to know that I 'm sorry . For everything . Fine . You said it . Now leave . Oh , and , uh , those Dundee guys ? They 'll never bother you again . That 's all . Good night . That was pretty amazing what you did . - Where 's my mom ? - Upstairs . - She said it was a heart attack . - What ? Her system 's just been through way too much . Mom , I 'm here . Elinore . Baby girl . Joe ! Long time no see , you little brat . - Thanks , man . - No problem . - You all right ? - Are you okay ? Yeah . So glad you made it . I knew something was wrong . How ? I saw you in the woods . It was like the dome wanted me to . - I sound crazy . Heh . - It 's all crazy . I helped a woman give birth . She said the dome made her see her husband . And now there 's a new Alice here . It all must matter . No , Mom . You matter too . But if it brought you here , it must want me to go . No . At least it let me see my beautiful baby girl one last time . You and Carolyn take care of each other . Mom , you 're not going anywhere . But I am . So you have to be brave . Okay . I will . I promise . Love you . I love you so much , Mom . Nore ? Norrie ! Go . Bring her back . I 'll do anything you want . Just tell me what you want . Don 't take her away from me . Just tell me what you want !

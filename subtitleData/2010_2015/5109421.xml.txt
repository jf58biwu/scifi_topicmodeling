 Arggh ! Wait ! Wait ! King Minos , it 's me ! Your scribe ! Pericles ? Where are the others ? Dead . All dead . Your son ... That thing is not my son . Forgive me . My King , I did not mean ... But ... but the Royal Chronicles . A war lost . A kingdom destroyed . My line cursed by the gods . Burn it . My King ! My King ! My King ! Don 't ! I beg you ! There is only death ! I said burn them ! But the Chronicles ! All the secrets are ... Burn the Chronicles and you will destroy the curse ! King Minos ? Arggh ! I 'll give you three camels for the dancer ! How does it look , Sinbad ? Dangerous . I couldn 't agree more . Back to the ship it is . Not exactly . Sinbad ! A key that can unlock a great fortune . Did it ever occur to you that the old witch may have had another 10 keys , each with its own tall tale to hike up the price ? Of course it did . But then again , what if she didn 't ? Why is it always the long shot with you ? She dances better than all of our wives ! This is a bad idea . These men are slavers , not antique-collectors . Rumours would suggest that their master is otherwise . ... I would have married the camel ! When she shakes like that , I 'm not thinking about her belly ! I 'll give you three camels for the dancer ! I told you it would be easy . Well , trouble always is with you , Sinbad . It 's the getting out that concerns me . Details ! So , what exactly are we looking for , anyway ? The bull-headed seal of King Minos . King who ? Minos . A long-dead Greek who stole the head of the Colossus . Colossus ? 'Colossus of Rhodes ' Colossus ? As in ' one of the Seven Wonders of the World ' Colossus ? That Colossus . Sinbad , you 've dragged us here in search of legends . The Colossus stood a thousand years ago , and this Minos , King Minos , is nothing but a myth . Careful . It 's booby-trapped . A myth , you say ? Now , the enchanted key should disarm it . Are you sure ? What is it ? The Chronicles of King Minos . Within these pages is the location of the greatest treasure the world has ever known . The head of the Colossus . A giant thing . Made of pure gold . Pure gold ? I like the sound of that . To arms ! To arms ! Bring round the weapons ! - Who 's that ? - Where ? Company ? Over there in the tent ! Come on ! Go . Stick to the shadows . Quick ! Grab the weapons ! I 'll buy us some time . I 'll meet you on the dunes . Quickly ! There he is ! Here I am . Catch me if you can ! Let 's get him ! Move ! You go around the back ! Around that way ! Over here ! There ! Don 't let him escape . We can 't let him escape . The master will kill us . Where did he go ? I lost him . Look over there . Hurry . I can 't see them anywhere . Ladies . I 'm just passing through . They can 't hear you . They 're gone . What do you mean , " gone " ? Al-Jibar , the master of the house . He 's a sorcerer . He steals people 's minds . Sorcerers . I hate sorcerers . Wait ! Please , you have to take me with you . Hardly . I 'll scream . No , you won 't . Guards ! Go ! You idiot . If you 've allowed some filthy desert pig to plunder my harem , I 'll have my eagle pluck out your eyes and feed them to my dogs ! Up , whores . Up . Where 's my prize ? Tara ? I 'm here . Forgive me . I screamed because I thought I saw a rat . Hmm . I was just indecent . Oh ? Modesty . You 'll have to lose that . Master ! Master . They 've got one of your treasures . Oh ! Oh , h-how is this possible ? The thieves subdued the guard . No , the case , you fool . The case . The whereabouts of the head of the Colossus , a thousand years sealed . Only the enchanted key can disarm it . No-one , no-one in all that time , not I , not I , even the great Al-Jibar , has been able to force open the enchanted seal . Perhaps you should ask the thief yourself . Oh ! I am Seif the Undying . And you are ? Unimpressed . Seize him ! Oh ! Kneel ! Kneel . Kneel . Kneel . Arggh ! Get up ! Get up ! Guards ! Guards ! There they are ! Get them ! Stop them ! Surround them ! Don 't let them escape ! You have something that belongs to me . The girl sees it differently . Don 't test me , thief ! The Chronicles of King Minos - give them to me ! Well , the case may belong to you , but as for the secrets discovered inside - finders keepers . The enchanted key . It 's no good to me now . Where did you find this ? It 's just something I found along my way . Much like this - the magic cloak of mist . Where did they go ? Where ? Find them ! Find them ! Find them ! - Good dancing , Luna . - Where is Sinbad ? He should be back by now . Trust me . If he 's late , it 's only because he 's stirring up trouble . Could it be treasure , you think ? Coins of silver ? Jewellery ? Sinbad ? Come on . The man just can 't help himself . We have to get back to the ship . Wait , you used the cloak of mist . But there was only three buttons left . And now there 's only two . Who 's the stray ? Details . Mount up , ladies . We have a long travel ahead of us ... before dawn . Stay here . Yah ! Come on . The coast is clear . If we hurry , we can reach Daresh by nightfall . Daresh ? Is that your home ? It 's where my ship is moored . The sea is my home . More like your wife . One of three , in fact ... their names being the sea , adventure and selfish glory . You 'd do well to remember that , girl . His heart 's taken by much grander things than you or I. You don 't have to tag along . You sought MY help . And I played my part . It 's time for you to pay me what you owe me . Once we find the head of the Colossus , you will get what you are owed - trust me . Trust you ? Take your wench . Oh ! Ooh ! I 'm keeping the horse . Yah ! It 's all just chicken scratches to me . Are you sure Nestor can decipher it ? Well , the Chronicles are in Old Greek . Nestor is an old Greek . Well , he 's old but he 's not ancient . Details . What about Luna ? Daresh is a place of opportunity . She 'll be fine . Sinbad , do ... do you ... ? Watch the horses . Halt ! Can I help you ? We 're looking for this man . Oh , shifty-looking fellow , isn 't he ? Can 't say I 've seen him , though . I thought you killed him . I did . Impressive . In case you do , be sure to leave word at the gates of Daresh . I can assure you our master is beyond generous when it comes to this matter . Who is he ? A dead man . Hold . Where 's your companion ? Companion ? Oh . Uh ... they 're both mine . I 'm a courier . My master is quite the man with letters . Keeps me so busy , I practically live in the saddle . Move out , men . Yah ! This is bad . With the amount of coin that Al-Jibar 's dogs are throwing around , the whole of Daresh would have turned spy by nightfall . I want you to go to Daresh , rouse the crew . Tell Boz to sail to Prophet 's Cove . I 'm going to cut across inland and meet you there . Yes , sir . Excuse me ! Al-Jibar 's after me too , in case you forgot . He 's not after you . He 's after this . Well , I don 't see him making that distinction . Besides , I helped you get that . And I saved your life . So you owe me . I 'm a part of this now , whether you like it or not . I 'm beginning to like this one . Speak for yourself . Is that your ship ? Beautiful , isn 't she ? Whoa ! Akoom ! Looks like hunting is good . This ? It 's only a snack . So , it 's another voyage again ? Certainly . Do we get to fight ? Possibly . What about wenches ? Definitely not . And gold ? There 'll be mountains of it . I 'm in ! I thought you would be . We 'll see you back at camp for the feast . Feast ? What feast ? Oi ! Get your own dinner ! No ! There ! There ! Hey ! Stop ! Get her ! Oh ! No ... Now , my little dancer . It 's all about the belly , isn 't it ? What do you want ? I 've got no money . You can have my horse . Take my horse . Where is he ? I ... Who is he ? I ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . He paid you to dance . No . I dance all around the region . The people who watch me pay me . Liar ! I swear ! No , please don 't ! No ! E pack of bow-legged whoresons ! Can 't you see your captain 's approaching ? Stop sunning your bellies pink and move your asses . Look ! It 's Sinbad ! Whoa , boy . Ah ! She looks good , but can she cook , Sinbad ? Boz ? How 's the crew ? Well enough , Captain . Though , I dare say , most be bitter and blue-balled over all the ... Shhh ! That is to say , the men be all frustrated , like , over their shore leave being cut . Maybe this will lift their spirits . The Chronicles of King Minos ! By the gods , Sinbad ! Of course , you know what this means . It means we know the very location of the golden head of the Colossus . As long as you can figure out these chicken scratches . Of course , of course . It 'll just take a little time to translate . Well , there 's no time . We set sail today . But , Sinbad , we don 't know where we 're going or how far . Details . We need to plan for provisions . Details ! Details . We 'll all find out along the way . So , who 'd you piss off this time ? Enough ! Now I want his name ! No . Go to hell . Hell ? What do you know about hell ? I want his name . Sinbad . Ready the men . I want this Sinbad 's head and the Colossus both . Seek ! Good ! Land ho ! The island of Minos . Boz ! We 're rowing in . I can 't believe we spent eight weeks at sea for this . Minos wasn 't looking for paradise . He was looking for somewhere to hide . See , when Minos started his reign , he was already a powerful man ... King of the Minoans , ruler of the island of Crete . But it wasn 't enough . He wanted more . Casting his eye across the Aegean Sea , he set his sights on conquering the island kingdom of Rhodes . OK , Nestor . Let 's go . This way , Nestor . Come on . After his defeat at Xanthos , Minos 's cause was well and truly lost . Thus it was decided that in celebration of their great victory , they would use ... However , soon after its completion , Minos stole the head and brought it here . Enough of the histrionics , Nestor . We are here for the treasure . Help me with the bucket . I thought you said this island was uninhabited . Can you bring the horses here ? It was . Back when Minos and his handful of surviving Minoans first arrived here , but ... a lot can change in a thousand years . Funny-looking bunch , aren 't they ? Bring the children here . Now ! I 'm Timos , son of Talos , first among hunters . I speak for my village . Well , I am Sinbad , and I speak for myself . Trading season 's over . Outsiders are not welcome here . Yes , move on . You 're not welcome . Well , Timos , son of Talos maybe we 'll welcome ourselves ! Sinbad , stop ! Captain ! If I may . Good sir , I am Princess Tara of Lycia , betrothed to the mighty Sultan of Temsaman . I am sure you 've heard of him . A storm drove my ship off course and I was subsequently held captive by a sorcerer named Al-Jibar . Having escaped , I happened upon these good men , who have offered their services to escort me to my wedding . If you could just see it within your heart to grant us a few days hospitality , I assure you your generosity would be royally rewarded . You can lodge at the feasting hall . The Sultan of Temsaman ? Trading season 's over . Our Royal Highness here has been given welcome by your man Timos . Ah . Be seated . What do you think ? Minoans ? This hall ? No question . These people ? Who can say ? Well , I say the sooner we 're out of this den of yokels , the better . Hello , blue eyes . Tell me , aside from your ... beautiful self , what else does this island have to offer ? Say , in the way of temples or old ruins . Maybe statues . There 's nothing like that around here . Except ... I suppose the view from the top of the Colossus . Colossus ! The mountain overlooking the village . That 's a strange name for a mountain . Strange , but that 's exactly where we 're going . Spread out , you slugs , and stay sharp . Ruins , markings ... anything old that ain 't a tree , the captain wants to know about it . What exactly are we looking for ? Some great work of appeasement to Helios , I imagine . Halt ! Captain , we 've found something . It 's a tunnel , boss . It smells like a pig-farmer 's ass in there and twice as ... Shh ! That is to say , ' pungent ' . Stay close . Why ? Are you scared ? Everybody follow me . King Minos 's great appeasement to the gods , I take it . Most likely a temple dedicated to Helios . Someone 's been here before us . A caretaker or priest . Perhaps looters . Maybe you 're not the only one with a map . Only one way to find out . Which way ? Let me see . By the prophets , it 's hot down here . We ARE inside a volcano . What 's the hold-up ? Well , they 've all got to lead somewhere . Sinbad ! Wait there . What kind of shrine is this ? There are no rooms , only corridors . Corridors that don 't lead anywhere . It 's by design . We 're in a labyrinth . Labyrinth ? Well , obviously King Minos didn 't want to make it so easy for us to find the golden head of the Colossus . We 're probably just walking around in circles . I 'm pretty sure we have been this way before . Sinbad ! Oh ! I 've got you , boss ! Thank the gods ! It wasn 't the gods that saved you . Stand firm , you maggots . What was that ? Stand firm . Nestor ! Boz ! Arggh ! Quick ! Volcanic ash ! Boz ! Boz ! Sinbad ! Stay where you are ! Boz ! Where are you ? I don 't know ! Are you with the others ? No ! It hit us like a storm , Sinbad . The others were ... The others were what ? Boz ! Sinbad ! This way ! Boz ! Boz ! Your death will not go unavenged , my friend . Sinbad ! You 're alive ! This way ! Wait ! Wait ! What are you doing ? No time to explain . Get behind the wall . Come on ! Come on ! I 've found them ! Over here ! Sinbad ! Shh ! The beast ? It 's gone . I can 't believe how big that beast was . I need more wine and better-looking women . To Sinbad ! The monster-slayer . The monster-slayer ! To our brothers who we lost today . May the gods grant them favour on their final voyage . Again . Again . Fill your cups . Come . Come , come , come . Come join us . There 's fine wine . Good Persian wine worthy of toasting heroes . To heroes . - Hear , hear . - To heroes ! Aren 't any of you the least bit curious about what we witnessed this morning ? 'Witnessed ' ? Don 't you mean ' vanquished ' ? The labyrinth 's now unguarded . Come tomorrow , the head of the Colossus is ours for the taking . We still need to find it . We all know it 's in there . It has to be . It 's in there , alright . But what of its guardian ? It 's dead . True enough . But what was it ? And where did it come from ? Details . Drink . " So it came to pass ... " " .. the seed of the sun god bore terrible fruit . " " Minos was cursed by the gods for stealing the golden head . " I tell you , as soon as we find this big old golden head , I 'm going to live like a king . Who 'd want to be ruled by you ? Well , I said LIVE like a king , not BE a king . I want servants , not subjects . And a lot of them . Tired of wiping your own ass , are we ? Well , maybe I am . We 're not looking to trade with outsiders . Trust me , if I can think of it , I 'll have no , not one , ten servants on hand around my sumptuous palace to do it . You know , back-scratchers , feet-rubberers , window-openers and cat-fanners ... Wait , wait . Cat-fanners ? Yeah . What ? It 's all the rage in Egypt . You know , Karim , you should be careful what you wish for . The life you speak of isn 't always what it seems . I 'm sorry about your men . It wasn 't your fault . Tomorrow . The Colossus . Your share in the bounty will make quite the dowry for the Sultan of Temsaman . To be a prisoner in an ivory tower ? To be married off without any love ? That 's not for me . I 'm free of all chains . And I intend to stay that way . How would you live if not as a princess ? To be honest ... I haven 't really thought that far . Being captured by the slavers , escaping the harem , voyaging with you these past few months . Places we 've been and people we 've met along the way . It 's all been so ... Perfect ? Perhaps I 'll buy a ship . If any of them move , kill them . Hello again ... thief . Or is it Sinbad ? It is Sinbad , isn 't it ? At least that 's what your pretty little dancer friend told me right before she died . Luna ! I will kill you for that . Oh , spare me your pointless oaths ! Now , give me the cloak or I 'll kill the rest of your companions . Why not ? I don 't plan to hide from you anymore . That 's good . Now , give me the King Minos Chronicles . Huh ? By the blood of Pythagoras . The child . The child is the beast . First , a toast . To Luna ! Oh , enough of the theatrics . Where ... are ... the Chronicles ? I lost them . - Kill them all ! - Yes , sir . Search that one 's body . What the ... ? Shoot him ! Now ! Shoot that thing ! What are they ? I 'm not sure . I can feel ! This one 's mine . I thought I 'd killed you already . Not so easy . Remember this ? Oh ! Sinbad ! Master , help me ! Stop , stop ! He 's awake ! Sinbad ! What happened ? Sorcery . Al-Jibar ! Where 's the girl ? Sinbad , she ... She ... she ... She what ? ! Sinbad , wait ! Sinbad ! Tara ! Tara ! Stop , Sinbad ! Get out of my way ! You saw it for yourself . These people are monsters ! It 's more than that . The Chronicles speak of royal sacrifices to the Minotaur , delivered to him by a high priestess and those of his bloodline . Don 't you see , Sinbad ? The princess , the beast down in the labyrinth ... they 're all connected ! I killed the beast . Oh , fancy yourself a god-slayer now , do you ? What ? Remember what I told you . Minos 's queen gave birth to a deformed son . Minos isn 't the father ! The Sun God is ! What do you mean ? I tell you , this beast is god spawn . You didn 't kill it . All you did was make it angry . All the more reason to find Tara . Al-Jibar took her . I 'm sorry , my friend . She 's gone . Listen to me now - we need to get back to the boat , and fast , before these ... creatures return . He 's right , boss . I say we go . Sinbad , please . We are but four men against an island of monsters . Nestor the ship is yours . Wait ! Well , hello , blue eyes . Wait . Don 't hurt me . Arianna . My name 's Arianna . Are you one of them ? Yes . I mean , no ! I mean ... Wait . Wait ... By the gods ! What 's happening ? Monsters . Shape-shifters . What were those things ? Answer me , woman ! I told you . I don 't know ! At first , they were just people . And then the beast from the labyrinth called . Master , please . I beg ... Shut up ! Labyrinth ? What labyrinth ? Within the volcano . It 's huge . Nestor said that it was built by an ancient king . Ah . So King Minos hid the head of the Colossus in the labyrinth . Up ! Both of you ! The labyrinth lies to the west . Master , please ... The girl has no more use for us . I beg you , let me feed ... No , no . No ! I still have a use for her . At some point , that fool Sinbad is going to come and get her . And when he does he won 't see me . Master , no ! I 'm dying . Oh ... Oh ! Eugh . No good . Looks like we 'll have to swim . Wait . Listen . Nestor . They 've seen us . For the All-Father ! To the sea ! No ! Head for the trees ! Come on ! Which way ? They 're everywhere ! Just keep moving ! Hold ! Cowards ! Ah . So there you perch , the all-seeing Helios , heralding the dawn , sitting astride your chariot , drawn by soulless steeds . Sun god . Pathetic ! Come . I smell blood . This way ! King Minos was right . You have to take power , not beg for it from above , on your knees ! Oh-ho ! Mighty Minotaur ! 'Tis but the praise of an orphan freak and nothing more ! All-Father ! Your dominion ... Your dominion over this world is long past . Gods of Olympus are but dust in the memories of men ! Their minds are ripe for a new god to take its place ! The whole world will kneel before me ! No ! Stop ! No ! You animal ! Get a move on ! The entrance must be just ahead . Move ! Ooh ! Oh ! Don 't test me , woman . Get up ! Kneel . Kneel . You first ! Get her , you fool ! She 's got the cloak of mists ! Come on ! Sinbad ! What are you ? He is my greatest creation . Body and soul of a man merged with that of an alghoul ... demon flesh-eater . Kill him as many times as you wish , Sinbad . He need only kill you once . Quick - untie me ! Sacrifice ! Tara ! Forget the girl . Your fight is with me ! So , tell me , Sinbad how does it feel to know you 're about to die ? You tell me ! Back ! Kneel ! Seif ! You stay put . Sinbad ... this isn 't over . It 's never over ! Tara ! Sinbad ! Help ! Where are you ? Sinbad , help ! Sacrifice ! Tara ! Clever girl . Where are you taking me ? All-Father . " All-Father " is not an answer . Temple , then . Oh ! Hurry ! Try losing them in the tunnels ! Hurry . Hurry ! I 'm hurrying , I 'm hurrying ! Why do they hesitate ? Let them come . There 's no need . They 've been herding us here all along . For a sacrifice . Thank you , master . I ... I knew you would return . Master ! I ... Such power ! Master ? Power ! Oh ! Bring me the knife . The knife , the knife ! Sinbad ! Help ! Where are you ? Sinbad , help ! Sinbad ! Help ! Tara ! Sinbad , help ! All-Father , great Minotaur , god of the mountain , I call to you . Come , Father . I am here for you now . Come , that I may bring you my offering ! Sinbad ? Sinbad ! Are you OK ? Yeah . You ? He comes ! The great Minotaur ! God of the mountain , come ! Come to me , father of fathers . I worship you and bring you your sacrifice of royal blood ! She 's one of them ! Look at her horns ! She 's a descendant of the bastard son of Helios . The one they turned into a Minotaur . The All-Father , the god of the mountain , great Minotaur comes and there will be no mercy ! No mercy ! No mercy ! Great Minotaur , it is as you command . Behold ! Your faithful brings sacrifice ! Before the sacred head , take her royal blood ! I 'll give you royal blood ! Impressive . The blood of your mighty ancestor compels you . All-Father ? My child . Can you not tell ? All-Father ! Yes ! That 's right , my children . That 's right . You 've always known me ! I am your god . I am your god ! You are my army ! Yo , Captain ! Captain ! Sinbad , can you hear me ? There ! Great Minotaur , I swear , I did just as you commanded ! Sinbad , the one who grieved you ... he 's here , right here in the temple ! All-Father , please , I beg you , come ! - Yo , Captain ! - Sinbad ! I thought I told you to stay at the ship ! This one said he smelled gold . Nestor was right . We can 't kill a god ! Get back ! Get back ! She 's one of yours , isn 't she ? Get back ! Who will collect your blood if your high priestess is dead ? You 're a fool , Sinbad . All-Father ! We 're cornered . Quick ! Everybody , behind the cloak ! Those fools ! Stay alert . The Minotaur is still nearby . Are we going back for the golden head ? You 'll never get that thing out of here . Tara , the cloak of mists can transport anything from one place to another . All we have to do is get back past the Minotaur . Well , you only have one button left . And it 's all we 'll need . Stay close . Your temple lies this way , master . Lead us to my temple . Akoom ! We have to get him out of here . - To the door ! - It 's closing ! Hurry ! Nestor ! Hold the door . We 're not gonna make it . I can 't ! I can 't hold it ! Move ! Come on , Tara ! Hurry ! Easy . Wait . No , this is all wrong . We didn 't ... we didn 't come this way before . We have to go back . Get a hold of yourself , Nestor . Keep moving . Careful , careful ! The gold , you mutants . No , no , not that way ! You lot , come with me ! Trust me , my child . They say the great sorcerer , kings of yore . I 'd sacrifice a thousand slaves to perform their dark rituals . I say ... they lacked vision ! With you to fund my armies I 'll sacrifice whole cities at a time ! I 'll drown entire nations in blood again and again until I have discovered every secret and mastered every mystery of this infernal abyss ! Ha ! It 's coming . Now , this looks familiar . Quickly , all of you ! It 's this way , I 'm sure of it . Nestor ! Nestor ! Nestor ! It 's coming ! You 'll be joining us back on the ship , friend . Sinbad . You must ... stop the Minotaur . You 're right . It 's time to fight . Sinbad , no . Please don 't . I 'll take Akoom . You lead the way . Nestor . What is it ? Only that of a god can kill a god . The horn ? Do you mean the horn ? Take it . If we take it , it 'll kill him . Kill me ? Look at me ! I 'm already dead ! Akoom , no . Take it ! Take it ! Let me die a warrior 's death ! Sinbad ! Sinbad ! Sinbad , where are you ? Sinbad ! You ! No ! Stay with the head . You three , the girl , go ! You call yourself an immortal ? ! You can 't even catch me ! Impressive . Sinbad ! The horn , use it ! For what ? Only that of a god can kill a god . Oh ! Sinbad , what now ? Revenge . Pain ! The pain ! The All-Father needs us ! What ? What 's happening ? I 'M the All-Father ! I command you ! Stop ! We can 't . Stop ! Stop ! All-Father ! Do something ! Obey your master ! Stop ! Stop ! With the Minoans in the tunnel , this could be our last chance to make it to the ship . We 're still taking the Colossus 's head ? Damn the Colossus ! I would give 10 such treasures for the lives of my men . Well , so , what , then ? You 're just gonna give up ? Have us turn tail and sail away ? When are you two going to realise that treasure doesn 't always come in the form of gold ? ! All-Father , great Minotaur , god of the mountain , I call to you ! I am the All-Father , god of the mountain . I am Minotaur ! All-Father , we failed you . Betrayers ! You dare show your face within these sacred walls ? No , All-Father , it was the blood . It commanded ... Silence ! You stand before your god and you dare speak of excuses ? The great head , my sacred birthright for over a thousand years , taken from the holy temple and defiled by unclean hands , aided by unfaithful children ! Forgive us , All-Father . Forgiveness ? You dare ask for forgiveness ? For mercy ? I am the All-Father , god of the mountain ! I am Minotaur and I know nothing but rage ! Rage ! What now ? You know , I 've been thinking , a trophy like this has to be worth something , right ? I mean , who wouldn 't want to hang this up on their mantel ? This thing is best forgotten . Look out ! Kneel ! Kneel ! Kneel . Let them go . Or what ? You lost , Sinbad . Your comrades are all dead . But your woman , well she never really was your woman in the first place , was she ? Well , how can I compete against an old , bald eunuch ? ! I 'll have your tongue for that . Seif ! Prepare yourself ! I no longer fear you . That 's why I 'll succeed ! Oh ! Just how long do you think you can go ? I 've conquered death already ! Conquer this ! Now , there is change . No , no , no , no . Nothing has changed . I am still st ... Die ! Burn ! Oh . I hate sorcerers . I bring a message for you from the mountain . He comes . He comes . The All-Father approaches . The Minotaur . We 've got to get out of here . Such rage . Such powerful , beautiful rage . Come on . Let 's go . No . I 'll handle this . We need to be running from it ! No more running . He comes . He comes ! He is here ! Move ! Sinbad , what are you doing ? Well , he 's just a bull , isn 't he ? Come on ! I 'm the one who took your eye ! It 's me you want , beast ! Come on ! Come and get me ! Come on ! No ! Lucky last . No , Sinbad ! That 's for my crew . Sinbad ! All-Father . Leave her . She 's lost enough already . We all have . What ? The head ! The head ! The golden head ! The mountain gave it up . Whoo-hoo ! Ha ! So what now , Sinbad ? Back to the ship with all your gold ? Off on another adventure ? Hmph . Not all treasure comes in the form of gold . We 're rich ! Mmm . We 're rich , Sinbad ! We 're rich . Details ...

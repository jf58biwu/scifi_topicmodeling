We only do loans here . But he might not be human . Do you take sugar ? Yes . Two spoons , please . What do you mean , he 's not human ? He steals money from places like this . He 's so fluent in Korean ! You 're right . Thieves are less than human . Youre right about that , but what are you all doing here ? Does that work ? - What ? - The CCTV . Of course it works . You think it 's for show or something ? Did it record anything unusual ? Or maybe your books didn 't add up . Or something strange appeared ... Like when you take your boxers off at night That weird feeling you get ... My goodness ! This guy is hilarious . What weird feeling might that be ? What he means is ... Cops must mean trouble in your line of work , and ... Fucking idiots ... Jesus . Miss LEE . You see the kind of shit I have to deal with ? And now theyre getting all global on me . Who do you think you 're dealing with ? My brother is a goddamn cop . Get out before I report you . But if you watch the CCTV ... That 's a fake camera . All right ? Get the fuck out of here ! Call us if you see something weird ! Come again ! Crazy bastards ! quick LOANS PAWNSHOP - Go away ! - Sir PAWNSHOP Get out ! Can you see ? Yeah , kind of . But ... You think this will work ? You said he uses the eyes . Won 't we be okay if he can 't see our eyes ? Or do we have to cover his eyes ? We 'll try it anyway . This is the main attraction here . One shot of this will blind anyone alive . Pretty nice , isnt it ? We can 't take it back to the police now . So I made some alterations . Hey ! That 's not finished yet ! Don 't touch it ! Did you try shooting it ? I will right now . Bubba ! Hasta la vista , baby . Who is it ? Police , maam . Why ... He wouldn 't come back after over twenty years . She couldn 't even recognize her own sons face . Detective SEO ! Check the kitchen . It 's hard . It 's really hard , isn 't it ? Sheesh ... Where is he hiding ? Kyu-nam . Say that we find the guy . What then ? His power may not work on you , but it works on others . It 's not a matter of you against him . It 's you fighting against everyone else he controls . But it 's the three of us against him alone . What could he do by himself ? I don 't know . Never mind . Let 's just do this and get a nice , cold drink . - Over at the pub . - The pub ? Wher 'es that ? The pub over by the intersection . When did you find a place like that ? Yeah . Let 's get a nice drink afterwards . I 'll buy . You know I don 't drink . You want me to sip Sprite again ? Fuck ! He was looking for us too ! Bubba ! Snap out of it ! Wake up , Bubba ! Come on , you idiot ! Hey ! No ! Where is he ? ! Kyu-nam ! Do you see him ? Can you see him ? - That bastard ! - Where are you going ? Put on your helmet ! I can 't drive with it on ! Then just stay here . Shit ! You 're still alive . I thought you were dead . Let 's say you and your friends find me . Then what ? Don 't you understand ? There was no need for this . You 're just making things worse . It was nothing important . But you dragged things this far . Your boss died because of you . You understand ? These people don 't even know whats happening . They won 't remember . But theyre going to suffer , all because of you . They could die . And they 've died before . What do you think ? What if all these people died right now ? Who would they blame ? You , or me ? You fucking crazy bastard ! This is all you ! You 're the bad guy ! You think so ? Let 's see what happens . No ! Stop it ! Who do you think will win ? You against the hundreds of me ? Or the hundreds of me against you alone ? Come on . Do you even know who you 're dealing with ? Come out and show yourself ! No ! Do you know what happened ? Didn 't you see anything ? Shoot ! Did I get him ? You 're the one that made the shot . Put it back on ! Grab him as soon as you see him . Then I 'll put this on his head . There ! Bubba ! Where did they go ? Al ! Bubba ! Bubba ! Al ! Bubba ! Al ! Don 't move . They 're not dead yet . Hanging someone apparently kills them quickly . What do you want me to do ? What ? What do you want from me ? I don 't want anything from you . Then let 's stop . It 's not exactly for you to decide anymore . Stop after making such a mess of things ? That wont work . Damn it ! Am I wrong ? Maybe we should ask your friends . Bubba ! Al ! Are you okay ? Wake up ! Snap out of it ! How did you get caught ? It 's okay . Don 't worry ! Everything will be fine , Al ! It 's not fine ! Don 't cry , Bubba . Stop crying . Be a man ! You mother fucker ! Stop joking around and let them down ! You think this is a joke ? Can 't you see whats going on ? All because of you , my fucking life ... You should 've never met me . That 's right . You should 've never met them . Or even that boss of yours . In fact ... You should 've never met anyone . Stop talking shit and let them down . This has nothing to do with them . It 's all about them ! They 're all dying because of you ! And you ... You 're dying because you met me . Being different from everyone else ... It 's so hard . Isn 't it ? Fucking bastard ! I must say ... You 've had quite an interesting life . Stop . Just stop , please . I 'm begging you . Losing something that matters to you ... It always feels like shit . No ! It was fun while it lasted . Manager lim . Kyu-nam ... Get up ! We 'll be late ! Are you okay ? He got seriously injured ! Great fucking weather . Where 's Young-suk ? Look at all those people . Hey . Do you like being yourself ? Tell me where Young-suk is ! I already told you , they 're dying because of you . You killed her , too ? ! You call yourself a human being ? ! Say hi to my friends for me , you fuck ! No ! Without me , you would 've been nothing . You would 've kept living as Manager lim , right ? But I wouldn 't have ended up like this either ! All you have to do is die in order to save them all . Why try so hard to stay alive together ? None of that matters now . I won 't die until I kill you first . And for the rest of my long life , I 'll save as many lives as you 've taken . I 'm starting to see why it didn 't work on you . But I just wanted to live too ! You fucking bastard ... Tell me your name . Right ... Who else would remember me ? " ln another life , would we have been friends ? " Could we have been friends ? I can go alone to visit my Dad ... I 'll get my drivers license soon . Let 's stick it out , just a little bit more . Wait here . Hey , look over there .

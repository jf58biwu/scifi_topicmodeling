 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : OLIVIA : What can you tell me about Cortexiphan ? WALTER : It worked on perception . BELL : Of all the children that Walter and I prepared you were the strongest . A storm is coming . When it is over , I fear there will be little left of our world . William Bell told me that man , Newton would try to open a corridor from our universe to the other side . Dr. Bell was afraid that if the doorway between the two universes opened only one world would remain . PAULINE : Hey . I thought you were getting out of here . Afraid not . It 's gonna be a late one . Wait a second . Is that ? Is that real coffee ? - Where did you get that ? - I don 't know . I have my sources . I got a cousin in Hawaii , she has a secret stash . She sends me stuff ... [ RUMBLING ] This is getting nuts . What is that , six since yesterday ? Well , I 'm from California , so I 'm used to it , you know ? But this is New York . Don 't you think it 's strange ? PAULINE : Mm . What 's the news say ? That they 're just these little quakes . You know . Microquakes . Probably just some byproduct of global warming . Well , see you tomorrow . Oh , and if you have any extra coffee ... - Good night , Pauline . - Good night . [ CAR ALARMS RINGING ] [ TED GRUNTS ] [ TED GROANING ] [ SCREAMS ] You gotta be kidding me . Congratulations , Mr. Bishop , you won an all-expense paid trip to New York City . I thought I told you to take me off your contestant list . Not according to our records . Says here that you 're a fan of fine dining and excitement . Do you have a supervisor ? Anybody there I can complain to ? - Because this has to stop . - Did I mention there 's excitement ? Walter , wake up . We just won a paid trip to New York City . WALTER : An earthquake in Manhattan ? It 's possible , but highly unlikely . Perhaps a small comet . Any witnesses ? Witnesses outside felt the ground shake , but no one saw what happened . [ SIREN WAILING ] MAN : All the way down . Make sure they set that up . OLIVIA : What about the people inside ? Emergency services secured the entrance scouring the place for survivors . - How many did they find ? - Zero . - It looks ... - Rearranged . Extraordinary . OLIVIA : Oh , my God . I don 't suppose you have any idea what could have caused this . A quantum tectonic event would be my guess . Until now this phenomenon has just been theoretical . A quantum tectonic event ? Well , yes . Imagine a sudden momentary disturbance at a subatomic level . Energy disperses the atoms , literally tearing the very fabric of reality itself . All the atoms come apart . When they reassemble , they come together all wrong . So , what are the odds of this occurring naturally ? Well , it 's possible . But if so God has a far more disturbed sense of humor than even I could have imagined . MAN : Got a survivor ! PARAMEDIC : Third floor , let 's move ! - ID says his name is Ted Pratchett . TED : Help , please . PARAMEDIC : Hold still , sir . It 's important you try not to move . TED : Please , help . [ YELLS ] PARAMEDIC : I don 't know if we can cut him loose from that beam . Call my wife . Someone please call . I just want to hear her voice . Mr. Pratchett , I 'm Special Agent Broyles with the FBI . This is Agent Dunham . We 're gonna do everything we can to find your wife and get you out of here safely . I 'll call this in . Mr. Pratchett , it would help us a lot if you could describe what happened here . Tremor . Just like the other ones but a really big one that just kept getting worse . [ TED GRUNTING ] I 'm so thirsty . He can 't drink anything . Maybe some ice , but no liquids . PETER : I 'm on it . Mr. Pratchett , did anything unusual happen before the disaster ? Someone in the building who shouldn 't be here ? No . Just the same things everyone saw . Yesterday , the dogs all started howling . Then all those little tremors . The microquakes . Did you hear about any tremors in New York ? Ted Pratchett doesn 't have a wife . Appears he never did . OLIVIA : Makes sense . Trauma from his injuries . He must be delirious . I don 't think so . Excuse me , miss . Thank you . Thank you . Sir , what year is it ? - 2010 . WALTER : Good , good . - Walter . - And who is the president ? - President Obama . - Good , good , good . WALTER : Now , I 'm sorry to do this ... - Walter , hey , what 's the point of this ? I 'm sorry about this , but it is very important . On September the 11th , when the terrorists struck which buildings did they attack ? - The Pentagon ... WALTER : Uh-huh . ... and the White House . I think I know what happened here . Walter , what is that ? [ GASPING ] WALTER : My theory was wrong . This wasn 't a quantum event at all . We 're standing in two buildings one of which comes from the alternate universe . I 've asked them to send Mr. Pratchett 's bodies back to the lab . Maybe they 'll provide some insight into how this thing happened . - I already know how this happened . - Oh ? Two universes colliding . This is what William Bell warned me about . He said that Newton would try to open a doorway from our universe to the other side . And that when it happened , this would be the consequence . Two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time . This was Newton , I 'm sure of it . He was here . [ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ] Walter , I don 't think I can do this . I 've seen some disturbing things in my time with you and I think I 've handled them pretty well . But this I can 't do . Awful , isn 't it ? Those boxes have evidence from the building . - You can go through those . - Thank you . [ WALTER HUMMING ] - All right , so , what am I looking for ? - Anything looking like it doesn 't belong . Okay . ASTRID : I think this qualifies . - Richard Nixon on a silver dollar . - Well , that 's disturbing . When you separate them how are you gonna tell them apart ? Mr. Pratchett from over there was married . He 's wearing a wedding ring . So as far as his wife will ever know , he just disappeared ? That is so sad . - Yes , it is . - Wow , look at this . It 's a double decker car . Does this mean that they drive these over there ? Yeah , I suppose so . What ? I know what Newton did . And I 'm afraid I 've just remembered what 's going to happen next . Newton . He was there . This was taken two hours before the incident . He and his men disguised themselves as a construction crew . So how do we find him ? We 're running down VIN numbers and equipment rentals . But I would like to take a crew back to New York . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] It 's Walter . Hey . - I need you back at the lab . Dunham as well . - We 're in the middle of something . Don 't argue with me , son . Get back here now . Both of you . PETER : That is what 's so important ? This happened almost 25 years ago . Right here on campus . PETER : I know , I 've heard this story . MIT students fused a car to the statue of John Harvard . They cut the car . Never figured out how they did it . It wasn 't MIT students , was it ? One of your experiments ? When Belly and I tried to generate a stable door between the universes our first test subject was a car . Belly 's old Monte Carlo . It did not go well . - First times are always sloppy . - Wasn 't our first time . Eleven minutes after we successfully made the car disappear this car appeared from another reality . - It wasn 't pulled down the block ? It was in 1986 . The car had a CD player . It wasn 't an option at the time . Okay , assuming what you 're saying is true , why ? I mean , how did the car appear ? WALTER : The universe seeks balance . We sent a car over there so a car of equal mass came back . Now , a building from the other side appeared here . The laws of physics demand both sides of the equation balance . I calculate that a building from this side will be pulled over there inhabitants and all within the next ... Just under 35 hours . Okay , so how do we stop it ? That 's it , Agent Dunham . We can 't . Then we need to evacuate the building . How do we identify which one it 'll be ? The one thing that Belly and I learned from our experience is that when objects from the other universe cross to our side they have an energy . Someone once described it as a glimmer . I believe that in the moments before the event when the fabric of the universes is rubbing together , that the building on this side will begin to take on that glimmer . - So we 'll be able to see it . Unfortunately it 's not visible to the human eye . - Then how the hell are we gonna find it ? - We can 't , Peter . - But you can , Agent Dunham . - How can I see it ? Because you saw it once before . Walter , when did I see things from the other side ? Twenty-six years ago . You were a little girl . The Cortexiphan trials . As I 've said , the drug worked on perception . Of the 30 children that William Bell and I experimented on , you were the first with the ability to identify things from the other side . We gave you the ability . You conducted illegal drug trials on children . Don 't make that sound like charity work . Was it me who described it as a glimmer ? I can 't see it anymore . You stopped wanting to . When you did , there were consequences . But I was able to elicit the ability once . I believe I may be able to do it again . Don 't be ridiculous . You 're not experimenting on Olivia . - And besides ... - Okay . I 'll do it . - Olivia ... - We don 't have time . Tell me what to do . First I need to go to Jacksonville . To the lab where Belly and I first conducted the Cortexiphan trials . The daycare center you attended . I should be able to re-create the procedure there . Jacksonville 's a thousand miles away . One thousand 16 . Not counting the trip to the airport . PETER : I 'm sure whatever you need , we can get it here . WALTER : What I need is in Jacksonville . Jacksonville is where the process worked . If I 'm able to do it again , it has to be there . A building in Manhattan is just going to disappear . Yes . That 's what Walter believes . What makes him think the trigger of your ability is inside the facility in Jacksonville ? When Bell founded Massive Dynamic , he bought the building and the military base it sits on from the government . He shut it down and closed it off . I believe that everything is still inside . And you 're sure you want to do this ? Submit yourself to Dr. Bishop 's experiments . I don 't see another choice . Then how can I help ? The events Ted Pratchett said led up to the incident . The dogs howling small earthquakes . Walter thinks that they will likely occur again . We can use them to infer when it 's about to happen . I 'll contact Nina Sharp . Ask to have Massive Dynamic enlist the geologic division to track seismic activity . - Thank you . - And , Dunham stay in touch . I will . WALTER : Five 20 10 . Belly always used the same combination . Though I can 't remember the significance . [ METAL CLANKS ] Come . Come in . Do you see anything ? Like what ? Sixteen items in this room are from the other side . Perhaps if you look a little closer . Come on . Go ahead . There 's nothing . Well , we should get started . I was hoping to avoid this . I have a freakishly good memory . I remember everything . Not this . There 's just nothing that 's familiar . Maybe that 's a good thing . We 're just about ready . You may want to change into something more comfortable . [ EKG BEEPING ] WALTER : Perception is largely an emotional response . How we feel affects the way we see the world . And so Belly and I reasoned that extreme emotions would stimulate this perception . That acute feelings of fear or love or anger would heighten the awareness . Open the mind , as it were . The drugs help , of course . Is that Cortexiphan ? Start the IV drip , please . The left arm . You sure you want to do this ? WALTER : Oh , wait . Right arm . No , left arm . Left arm . When you 're under , the drugs will generate an obstacle . I can 't tell you what it will be . It will be uniquely yours . - Do you understand ? - I think so . WALTER : It will make more sense when you 're under . The point is this : That facing that obstacle will elevate your emotional state . Much as running on a treadmill will elevate your heartbeat . And then when I 've got you to the proper level well , then I 'll pull you out . Okay ? I am singing in the rain . Oh . The drugs are working fast . - Perhaps it was the right arm . - What ? She 'll be fine , Peter . [ WHISPERING ] Peter . Would you turn that around ? Thank you . [ IN NORMAL VOICE ] Olivia , I want you to open your eyes . Olivia , can you hear me ? If you can hear me , open your eyes . Where are you ? OLIVIA : I 'm in a forest . I can see very tall trees . That 's good . That 's good , Olivia . Theta rhythms are now stable . Neocortex active . It 's working . There 's someone else here . VOICE [ WHISPERING ] : Olivia . [ HOOFBEATS APPROACHING ] [ ROAR ] [ GASPS ] [ EKG BEEPING FASTER ] - She all right ? - She 's not supposed to be . In my bag , Peter . PETER : Yeah . - The pretzels . PETER : Pretzels . OLIVIA : Hey . - It 's all right . GIRL : Please . I don 't wanna do this anymore . You don 't have to do anything that you don 't wanna do . You don 't have to do anything that you don 't wanna do . [ ROAR ] Wait . Wait ! Hey ! [ OLIVIA PANTING ] PETER : Walter ... Shh ! She 's close . OLIVIA : Wait , wait , wait . [ ROAR ] It 's okay . Shh . Shh . [ ROARING ] [ WINGS FLAPPING ] Shh . GIRL : Please , make them stop . - It 's okay . - Please , make them stop it . - It 's okay . [ ROARING ] It 's okay . I 'm here now . Nothing can hurt you . It 's okay . That 's better . What 's your name ? Olive . [ FAINT ROAR ] VOICE [ WHISPERS ] : Olivia . [ ROARS ] [ OLIVIA SCREAMS ] Good news . It worked . What the hell is wrong with you ? You did this to little children ? We should get to work . - Anything ? - Nothing . Now what ? Should we find some more kids to scare ? I have no idea . [ DOGS BARKING AND HOWLING ] Phillip , it 's me . [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] - Dunham . - It 's started . Okay . BELL [ ON TV ] : Is she okay ? WALTER [ ON TV ] : She 's fine . BELL : Hell . Do we know what triggered it ? WALTER : Obviously she was upset , William . It 's okay . It 's all right , Olive . That 's me . What happened ? This was the first time you saw the other side . You were frightened . Started a fire with your mind . It should have worked . This is the very sort of thing that William and I were preparing for . You abused us , Walter . Me and other children . No , we were trying to help you . We were trying to make you more than you were . Is that what you were doing ? Or searching for answers to questions you shouldn 't have been asking in the first place ? I was a different man then . I was a defenseless child . Yes , you were . Yes , you were . I think I 'm starting to understand why the process didn 't work . You are different . You 're not that frightened child anymore . I thought all we needed was a heightened emotional response from you . But I was wrong . We needed a specific one : Fear . And you 're not capable of that anymore . Well , not like she was . What we did to you , you found a way to protect yourself . You channel your fear into anger . Which is why you 're so good at your job . But if you want to save those people you have to find your way back to that scared little girl . And how do we do that ? I don 't know . Hey . Is this a part of Walter 's test ? Are you all right ? No . I 'm not afraid of anything anymore . NINA : Okay , let me know if anything changes . Four tremors in the last two hours . The most recent measured 2.6 . They 're increasing in frequency . I 'm sorry . You didn 't send that building over here . What 's plan B ? We 're compiling data , trying to predict where the next incident will take place . Satellite images , seismic activity , weather patterns . - You need a fresh set of eyes ? - Yes . I 'll take you to the lab . We 've still got time . We 've been plotting the epicenter of each microquake looking for some sort of pattern . - Can you regress any of the data points ? WALTER : It 's a waste of time . A useless attempt to impose order on random , meaningless data . I did the same thing 25 years ago when the car came over . Tried to determine why . Why there ? Why had it landed in the middle of the quad ? The answer is there is no answer . PETER : Except mass . The two cars . You said they were the same mass . You two got something going on . Wanna fill me in ? Walter thinks the two universes have to be in balance . A building from there travels here , a building from here of the same mass has to travel back . - Yeah , Raiders of the Lost Ark . The bag of sand and the idol . - Not the metaphor I 'd use , but yes . - Yeah . - You have a pencil ? - I have a pen . I need satellite data and 3-D imagery to calculate cubic feet . I 'll need a comprehensive list of building materials used during construction . For every free-standing structure in New York City ? Oh , I think we can rule out the Empire State Building . OLIVIA : Hey , Peter . Anything ? Good news . We have a plan . You can eliminate the three buildings in Tribeca , because they 're way too big . WALTER : Are they lofts ? - Yeah . Why ? Lofts have no interior walls . One building might be bigger . They could be the same mass . - Yup . - The guys on the supercomputer are crunching numbers on the first six buildings , but it 'll take some time . What else can I do to help ? [ WATCH BEEPS ] It 's time . It could happen any moment now . - Olivia , I ... - How many buildings are we down to ? A hundred and forty-seven buildings , spread out all over Manhattan . Three hospitals , a cancer treatment center , a nursing home . The NYPD and the Fire Department have a standing evacuation protocol . They could clear most of those buildings ... The evacuation itself would kill a lot of these people . Not to mention cause a citywide panic that might kill thousands more . The largest building on this list has , what , 500 people ? So you think we should just let the building disappear ? Let those people disappear . There are times when the only choices you have left are bad ones . Hey . Figured if I shut down nonessential functions I could make these things run faster . It 's too late . I failed . I failed , and I 'm supposed to be the one who can stop things like this . Olivia . You ... I 've never met anyone who can do the things that you do . Peter . I 'm scared . Don 't be . What ? Peter , I 'm scared . It was in the West Village , near the Hudson . I couldn 't see exactly where . PETER : Near the piers ? - Yeah , couple blocks from the river . Any landmarks , other buildings nearby ... ? Yeah , that new tower near the elevated tracks . - The High Line . - Still too many potential candidates . [ RUMBLING ] - Olivia , we need you to narrow down ... - I 'm trying . Okay , I see it . It 's on Washington . There 's a hotel on Washington ... BROYLES : What do we have on Washington ? He 's right . Brayson Place Hotel , 13th and Washington . Number there . Call Solomon at the NYPD . Call the Fire Department ... Hello . This is Special Agent Phillip Broyles with the FBI . You need to evacuate everyone from the building immediately . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ PEOPLE SHOUTING ] Come on ! [ CAR ALARM RINGING ] [ GLASS SHATTERING ] - Is everyone out ? - I think so . Go ! [ RUMBLING AND WHOOSHING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ RUMBLING AND WHOOSHING STOP ] I guess it 's safe to say that you 've got the rest of the night off work . REPORTER : Not a single casualty as hundreds miraculously escaped what federal authorities are calling an unscheduled controlled demolition at the Brayson Place Hotel . Conspiracy nuts are gonna have a field day . You 'd be surprised what you can make the general public believe . You saved a lot of people . We all did . Dunham . This ability you 've demonstrated . What finally activated it ? I think it was just time . Yeah , Monopoly is great . He loves the colored money . Okay . Thanks again . We 'll see you soon . Hey , Walter , that was Astrid . She 's gonna come over and play some games with you . Mm . Good . I hope she likes Monopoly . [ PETER CHUCKLES ] - Where are you going ? - Me ? Out for drinks . - Oh , who are you drinking with ? - Olivia . Agent Dunham . A date ? No . Just drinks . Apparently that 's what normal people do . They go out for drinks . If you need to reach me I 'll leave you the number of the restaurant right here . Okay ? [ KNOCKS ] - She 's here , Peter . - I know . I heard it too . - Shall I get the door ? - Absolutely not . It would be my preference if you could be someplace else altogether . - Where ? - Chicago . - Hey . - Hey . Come on in . I know a great place . It 's just a couple blocks away . Thought we 'd walk . Agent Dunham . I 'll go get my coat . Olivia . Please don 't tell him . [ ENGLISH - US - SDH ] Ripped by stlc8tr

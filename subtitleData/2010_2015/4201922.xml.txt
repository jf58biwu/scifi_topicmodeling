 Blue team to base camp . Go , blue team . Are you getting this ? The seismic activity seems to be increasing exponentially . I 'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data . Copy . Blue team , reports show the hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings . Proceed with caution . Copy that . Base camp , we 're seeing intense magna flow running up and down the range . If it keeps increasing , we may have to evacuate the area now , all the local areas . Base camp , if the whole range starts erupting , we 're looking at a whole glacia detaching from the shelf . [ horns honking ] this is 6SNL7 calling summit camp . Do you read ? 6SNL7 to summit camp . Do you read ? Can I really talk to base on this thing ? Oh , absolutely . I talk to them all the time . This is 6snl7 to summit camp . Do you read ? Try a lower band . There you go . This is 6snl7 calling summit camp . Do you read ? This is 6snl7 calling summit camp . Do you read ? [ sighs ] just can 't get it . There 's too much interference . I 'm going to take down a plane with this thing . Better not . Hey , did you pack your gortex ? Hello ? Julia ? Julia ? Unbelievable .

I 'm not in the office . I 'm dropping julia off at the airport . Why ? What 's up ? We 're evacuating . The rest of the team is gone already . I 'm the last man standing . Evacuating ? Why ? Dad , I should just walk from here . Hekla went berserk . There 's a huge pressure buildup . The endurance readings are off the chart . The entire hekla line is erupting . There is pressure building up everywhere . Bill , I 've never seen anything like this . Pressure building up where ? At what site ? I 'm trying . Guys , hold on . We 're seeing activity across the entire range . Wait , at all the sites ? That doesn 't make any sense , divya . I checked with the other stations . No one 's ever seen anything like this . I sent you everything we got before the centers melted down , bill . Look at the data ! No , I 'm not at the office . I 'll be there in an hour . Pull up the computer simulation . Divya , can you read me ? Divya ? [ horns honking ] okay , I 'm going back to school now . No need to say goodbye or anything . Reykjanes ridge ? Yeah . Divya , are you there ? Magna flow rate ? f7 . Divya , can you read me ? Right , I 'll be back around christmastime unless I decide to stay in new york forever . Divya , come in .

Sir , you 're gonna have to move your car . Sir ? Hart , do you read me ? Yes , go ahead , divya . I read you . Go ahead . I can 't believe what 's happening ! The entire range is on fire ! Sir , this is a no parking zone . This is loading and unloading only . I need you to move your- - This is massive ! What 's happening ? The entire range is on fire ! Every single volcano is erupting ! Say again . I couldn 't understand . The entire ice shelf is fracturing ! It 's 1,000 miles long ! Bill , do you read me ? [ alarm beeps ] [ static ] something about the volcano . Is not moving . Dad , we need to go . Look . Yeah . Where 's julia ? She left , like , two minutes ago . What ? Ah , crap .

It wouldn 't be the first time . Dad , what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier ? Did it calf ? Well , it 's possible , but it sounded a lot bigger than that . That would be sick . Sick , huh ? 100 % . Why don 't you bring up the simulation again on the parameter screen , okay ? Okay , let 's see . Okay , using these numbers , see what you can come up with for the ice flow projection , okay ? I 'll be right back . Roy ? Bill ? What are you doing here ? I thought you were out in the field . I just spoke with divya , and he had sent you some data . Did you receive it ? Yeah , the hekla volcano just erupted . No , but it sounded more than the hekla , like the whole range went up . We know . Hart , go home . We 've got this . I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers . Why are you trying to send me home ? Bill , we don 't need you . Roy , look , we 've been friends for 15 years . What the hell 's going on here ? Bill , I have just put cynthia and my kids on a plane to mexico . You do the same . We have got chunks of ice falling all over canada . In 19 hours , the bulk of the glacier is going to hit north america . Bill , get your family out now . What did you get ? It won 't let me input this data . Okay . Well , let 's open up a terminal window and we 'll enter sandbox mode . What 's that ? Well , it 's a mode that allows you to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible . What does that mean ? It means we got to get your mom . Why ? Right now . I 'll tell y ou on the way . Hold on . Excuse me , senator . I 'm sorry to disturb you , but I just got off the phone with cyrus over at air traffic services , and he said that all the flights are grounded because of the volcanic ash flow .

All right , big hugs , and love you . Love you , love you , love you . Bye . Are you sure that new york is safe ? Bill ? How stupid . Why don 't we just have her fly and meet us down in florida ? Sweetheart , everything is grounded . I say we stay on plan and we just meet her at the dorm . Fine . Oh , my gosh ! It 's okay , it 's okay . We 're okay . Dad , I think it 's coming faster than we thought ! Have you ever seen this ? no . The glaciers are making it snow in maine ? It 's summer . Can you just get us out of maine now ? How big do these glaciers have to be to do this ? Bill ? [ horns honking ] crap . e ? Dad , does this snow mean the glacier 's getting clos bill , it has to because the clouds are looking massive . I bet this glacier is enormous , like the whole shelf . Yeah . Okay , here 's what we got to do . I got to find a way around this traffic . Nelson , jump on the gps and find me an alternate route . On it . Bill , get us out of here now ! We don 't know if the glacier is close . Those military planes ? F-16s . Nelson , focus . Gps .

That was about 100 square miles , which is roughly four times the size of manhattan , and that was only 8 % of the glacier . . This sounds like it 's the whole glacier with enough speed , who knows how much damage it could do ? What ? Dad ! [ shouting and screaming ] which way 's your room ? This way . Come on . Karen !

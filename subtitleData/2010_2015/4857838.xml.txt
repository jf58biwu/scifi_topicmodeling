 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Customer . I have a special ... order . - So I just moved here . - Why on Earth would you do that ? Claudia , wait ! I got the parts you ordered . You 're a wonder twin . So Claudia , Todd 's cute . This is me ignoring you . Eat shield , stabby ! Are you okay ? Here you go . Let me help you up . Here we go . Where 'd you learn to handle a sword like that ? Some girls play with Barbies , and others took fencing lessons . Everybody got all their limbs ? Yeah , that 's a big ten fingers and ten toes , good buddy . Behold ... mighty Excalibur . You snagged it . This could have been easier if we swapped it out for a fake . Only you , Artie , would know it was a tacky wall decoration in some cheesy castle in Cardiff . The rock , it worked ? Yes , you were right . As soon as the blade came into contact with the rock that was laced with the same metal , it ... The sword went out of phase and allowed it to pass right through solid matter . Preventing today 's pub special from being Myka meat pie . That 's how King Arthur did it . Nice , Artie . You sure know how to take the fun out of believing in legends . Some legends can have truth to them . So there was a real Merlin the Magician ? - Fiction . - Knights of the Round Table ? Bedtime story . Holy Grail ? Anyway , on your way back I want you to check something out for me in Italy . That 's not really on our way back . Yeah , but I got a ping , so go to Milan . Call me when you land . I 've never been to Italy . So how 'd she die ? Old age . No identification . But we found these inside her body . - That 's ... - Implants . - The old woman had implants . - I 've never seen them like this . When they weren 't on active duty ... Something else . The woman was shouting something before she died . - That 's Russian . - You speak Russian ? Yeah , you know , some girls played with Barbies and ... Got it , got it . What 'd she say ? It means ... It means , " they stole me . " I know how we can I.D. her . All surgical implants are labeled and coded by serial number , so you can track them through the doctor and back to the patient . Why am I not surprised that you are the expert on breast implants ? Some boys played with Barbies . Now these implants were placed in the body of ... - Wait . That can 't be right . - I don 't get it . Who is that ? Anya Verdikov , age 19 . Anya Verdikov . Wait , you know her ? - She 's a Russian model . - We need to meet with her right away . She was reported missing two days ago . You think ? - We have seen stranger things . - What ? Either someone took the implants out of Anya Verdikov and put them in the body of this old woman . Or this woman is the 19-year-old Anya Verdikov . Warehouse 13 - 2x04 Age Before Beauty Arrow , nitrogenc Salomon Welcome back . What 'd you bring me from Italy ? - You know it . - Hey , biscotti . It was a long flight . - What did you find out about Anya ? - Lots . Anya was not the first . Claudia , would you do the honors ? - Missing fashion models . - They vanished from different cities . From Tokyo , Berlin , and Paris , and London . So since we knew what to look for , it wasn 't hard to find a pattern . And after each model disappeared , they found the body of a Jane Doe . - Elderly . - Yes . Very old jane doe . It seemed like it was natural causes , but I don 't think so . An unidentified old Asian woman ... Asian woman was found dead two months ago in paris . - Hey , same tattoo . - Same place . - Same woman . - Have you ever seen an artifact that produces rapid aging in a person ? - I 've never seen anything like that . - Obviously it 's not a coincidence that all these victims were models , right ? - What 's the plan ? - Since all the attacks happened around the fashion industry and since this week in full swing in Manhattan is Fashion Week , two tickets to New York . Nice . Original Ray 's pizza . The original original Ray 's pizza is actually here . And funny thing about that is the mob bought the original cheese . You can 't make a decent pie without mob cheese . So the way to stop this is to find Anya 's agent . The agent will tell you where 's Anya has been and hopefully also what she 's been in touch with . Perfect . - What aisle is ... - Not a chance . Forget it . I 'll run an artifact search on the mainframe , see what might make the beautiful people go geezer . Thank you . That would be very help ... God , stop it . Something you 'd like to share with the rest of the class ? That only makes me a little bit more curious . Todd keeps texting me . You know , texting . It 's what the kids do these days instead of going to dinosaur races . I know what texting is ... Also iTunes and color television . What is a Todd ? You know , Todd . The guy from town , from the hardware store . What is with him ? " Want to meet for coffee ? " Give me my space ! Why don 't you text him back ? I remember that kid . He was ... inoffensive . Strike up the band . - You 're not a girl anymore . - What ? I just said , you know , you 're a woman . No , well , you 're a woman because you 're over 16 . I 'm just saying he 's a man and men and women ... If you 've never ... - I didn 't mean to ... - Pull up , pull up . I appreciate the advice , but can we just get back to work ? Best assignment ever . Just try not to be 12 years old . There is no try . Only do or do not . - Then do . - I 'll try . I have a quick meeting with Michael , after that I 'm going home . Would you ask Sutton if we can reschedule ? Oh , my ... Isabella Fuentes . I love you . I love your work . The 2004 swimsuit issue , I mean , that was like your Sgt. Pepper 's . - Excuse me , I 'm not feeling well . - I won 't take up lot of your time . I was just curious where you stood on dating civil servants . You 're scaring her . Ask anyone who 's made an enemy of me , Sutton , if they don 't dearly regret that decision . What , are we opening a Walmart ? Call Damian , have him send Romana another gift basket . - No food . - Miss Harris . I 'm Myka Bering . This is Pete Lattimer . We spoke on the phone regarding Anya Verdikov . Have you found her ? I told her I would take care of her . Do you have any idea what happened ? We were hoping you might know . Was she acting at all strangely ? Was there anyone new come into contact with her ? No one . She 'd been staying away from people . Why ? Just before Milan , Anya said she was coming down with the flu . Excuse me , I 'm not feeling well . It 's Isabella . - You 're nothing if not persistent . - You don 't look so good . - Your pickup lines are getting worse . - I need you to come with me . I think you might be in danger . - What are you talking ... - Are you okay ? I 'm sorry , I must be getting a fever . I 've just gotta get out of here . I 'm burning up . Pete , what 's happening ? Get an ambulance . It was nothing , girls . Just some poor old woman who took a fall . - What 's the matter with you ? - It just happened . You know , it was like a nightmare . I couldn 't help , and ... I just had to stand there and watch , Artie . Pete , there was nothing you could do . Now listen , get me the ... We 've seen a lot of bad juju from these artifacts , - but man , this one ... - Get your head back in the game . Get me a sample of her blood . It could lead to whatever artifact is causing this aging thing . They 're keeping a lid on what happened to Isabella for us . Are you okay ? Yeah , I will be when we find this thing . I tested her clothes and jewelry . The artifact definitely wasn 't on her . It wouldn 't be . She probably got zapped after a fashion show like Anya and the others . But why models ? What 's the connection , some ... hair dryer that they 're all using ? Anya said , " they stole me . " As if somebody was doing this to them on purpose . There are hundreds of people behind the scenes at these things . And fashion week ends in three days , and with it goes our potential suspects . So we 're gonna have to get in on the down low and smoke out the bad guy or girl . That 's easier said than done . - What ? - Just having a thought . - Is it a good thought ? - I 'm gonna say yes . You 're gonna say no . But I 'm right , you 're wrong . I think I know a way to find the person who 's doing this , okay , but I 'm gonna need your help . So how 'd we do ? You tell me . Holy crap . Welcome to the runway . One day you 're in , and the next day ... We get it . Through there 's backstage where the models change during the show . I hope you don 't mind taking your clothes off in public . Let me go sell you to Damian . I just don 't understand why I had to be the model . First of all , I don 't have the legs for a dress like that . And a model and her manager won 't stand out . Please , nobody 's gonna believe that I 'm a model . I don 't know how to do this . Just act like everyone 's been put on the Earth to serve you . - That 's idiotic . - Just like that , perfect . I couldn 't possibly work with a new girl . I 'm all about rapport . You can 't have rapport with someone fresh off the farm . She 's an undiscovered treasure . - That 's fine . - No one has even seen her yet . Don 't you want to be the first to bring her into the sun ? Fine . Let me see her . I don 't understand . Is she behind the fat girl ? Trust me , Damian . For you , Sutton , darling , anything . Myka Burton , top women 's fashion designer Damian Jardin . I 'm going to have to ask you to lay off the milk shakes , precious . What 's this ? I 'm Pete Lawson . I 'm Myka 's ... Personal assistant , does whatever I tell him . Right ? Speaking of slaves , Jenny ! This one , new photos . Andale ! Let me see that dress . Good luck . You are officially embedded . Coffee ? No thanks . I 'm jittery enough as is . I meant for me . Black , no sugar . Andale ! I 'm Gunther . I 'm here taking pictures . Ready to be beautiful ? Here we go . That 's right . Beautiful . Give me a little smile . There you go . Who 's that ? Sutton 's latest find for Damian . Didn 't we just get rid of the last latest find ? What did Anya ever do to you ? Just so we 're clear , Damian , I burn brightest . Little fat girls aren 't gonna sell your rags like I do . Of course , of course . Relax , Romana , you 'll get wrinkles . We 're not getting any younger . Why doesn 't some thoughtful psychopath kill her for me ? It 's like a game of gay clue . Careful . We don 't need much for a full chemical analysis . Can you explain to me again why I 'm doing this and you 're cowering ten feet away ? - I don 't like blood . - You picked the wrong line of work . - You have no idea . - Really ? Moving on . Gently , gently put the needle gently into that mass spectrometer . Sorry , sorry . Let me guess . Todd . Well ? - I took your advice . - What advice ? I gave no advice . I 'm meeting Todd later , cup of coffee , slice of pie , you know ? You have a date ? It 's more like a , you know , pie / coffee summit . Fix the economy , solve world peace . I could cancel . Be yourself . - I was just looking at your photos . - I 'm sorry . I guess I just had too much caffeine today . You 're pretty strong for a model . Most of these girls get winded just by pushing an elevator button . I eat food . Gunther took these , right ? Yeah , he did . He 's got a real eye . Tell him to put a star filter next time . It 'll bring out your eyes more . - You 're a photographer ? - Freelance . You 're Sutton 's new girl , right ? You 're a natural . You have a gift . I have a gift . How many of these things can you drink anyway ? I 'm not actually drinking them . I like making you go get them . - Nice . - So ? I checked a few of the dressing rooms . Nobody 's got the picture of Dorian Gray hanging up for decoration . The real one 's in the warehouse anyway . Is that what that is ? Man , I gotta stop looking at that . Right . I did find out that Romana hated Anya . Really ? It 's a tough business . Maybe she 's eliminating the competition . Why don 't you go distract her so I can check her dressing room ? But I don 't know how to distract her . Ask her for tips on torturing your assistant . So what 's your favorite movie ? God , I hate that . Yeah , me too . There 's eight billion different movies . You can never pick just one . And then am I telling you my real favorite movie or randomly picking the first movie that pops into my head ? Godfather . - So what high school did you go to ? - What do you mean ? - What high school did you go to ? - Why all the questions about my past ? It was just one question . You made me ask it twice . What can I get you guys ? BLT , please . I would like the chili , extra onions . - Guess no good-bye kiss , huh ? - What ? The onions . Bad breath . Kissing . Bad joke . Sorry . I mean , yes , I could get it to go . Eat it later after non-onion breath kissing . - I 'm not expecting kissing . - I wasn 't expecting kissing ... - Me neither . - ... or not . Or maybe . I should 've ordered grilled cheese . What am I doing here ? I 'm clearly a closed book with bad breath who 's too freakish to live , and I gotta go . Oh , my God . She wants this to go . Hi there . My name 's Myka . We met the other day in Sutton 's office . Tell Damian it 'll do . I was just wondering if you had any , you know , sisterly advice . My advice : Spanx . I 'm always amazed at the correlation between being beautiful and being a complete bitch . Being a successful model isn 't about beauty and it certainly isn 't about the clothes . Then what 's it about ? When I walk down the runway , with one look I can stop a war or start one . I make people want something that I have , because when I 'm out there I tear out my soul and I offer it for everyone to see . You think you can do that , sister ? Jenny , the schedule , please . I 'll be right there . Booyah Buddha . I don 't suppose you gave the same sisterly advice to Anya . Anya shoulda stayed in Russia and stuck with what she knew ... Borscht and bread lines . Sounds to me like you 're glad she 's dead . You 're very nosy . No , I 'm just curious about the people I work with . I wonder if the next girl will ask what happened to you . It 's all over , Jenny . - What 's happening ? - Is that it ? Crap . - Why are you doing it ? - I 'm not hurting anybody . You 've got a pretty whacked-out definition of " hurt " . They can afford to pay . Is that how Anya paid , with her youth ? - How did you kill her , jenny ? - I didn 't kill Anya . - She wasn 't even a customer . - A customer ? Look , how is the buddha aging the models ? What are you talking about ? - What are you talking about ? - Diet pills . Diet what now ? Easy , that 's ... Filled with teeny-tiny pills . - You 're peddling diet pills ? - They 're the good ones . Not legal here yet . I get them on the black market for ... You 're not here about the diet pills , are you ? Here 's what you 're gonna do . You 're gonna go home , call in sick , and stay there until you hear from me , or you 'll be explaing that little bobble-headed buddha to the DEA . I can hook you up if you let me go . You could lose those extra five pounds by , like , tomorrow . I don 't have an extra five pounds . Right . Go ! - Myka , we 're running out of time . - I know . I couldn 't believe it when you finally called . Anticipation has been interminable . You said you found her , the one ? Yes , she 's perfect . Good , you 're here . Well , the blood sample that Pete sent over has got trace elements of silver nitrate in it , which is not commonly found in human blood . What does that mean ? I have no idea . So what I ... How was your date ? It was perfect . Well , good . Good . So as I was saying , human blood ... Actually no kind of blood has sil ... - What ? - What kind of advice is be yourself ? Artie , that 's the worst advice I 've ever heard , because myself is a giant freakazoid with no past and no real interests outside of my top-secret job , which I can 't talk about . And I like onions . Can I come in ? Are you decent ? You know what , screw it , I 'm coming in . Don 't you dare laugh . No , no , I 'm so not laughing . Listen , I don 't want you to go out there . I 'm having some wicked bad vibes , and whatever , you know , whammy 's being done to the models , maybe it 's when they 're walking the runway . Okay , so it 's just ... It 's too dangerous and ... What ? No fight , no argument , no punching me in my soft spots ? No , no , I just , I won 't ... I 'm not gonna go out there . What 's going on ? Well , like you said , it 's dangerous . You don 't ever listen to me . Okay , I can 't , because I ... I can 't stop an army . And I can 't , you know , show people my soul . What are you ... What are you talking about ? Okay , some girls took fencing lessons , right ? And read books and studied and became secret service agents . And that , that out there , that is ... That is not me . Why not ? 'cause , you know ... I 'm not the pretty one . Who was the pretty one ? My sister . Tracy . Yeah , she 's the cheerleader and the homecoming queen . You know , she was the one that ... She was the one that all the boys were crazy about . She could do this . All right . Turn around . - Why ? - Because if I 'm going to say this , I can 't say it with you looking at me . So just turn around . I 'll turn around . I can 't say it to the back of your head either . You are a stunningly beautiful woman . The day that I met you , I said , " What , I 'm not gonna be able to work with her . " I won 't be able to stop staring at her . " But then I got to know you , and I realized that you 're even more beautiful than I could see . And if that , you know , little teen fencer could see what a beautiful woman that she would become , she would know that it 's her sister that should be jealous . - You good to go ? - I am good to go . - All right , all right . - I 'm going . Wait , wait a minute . I came here to talk you out of it . Myka , come here . There you are . Where were you , Arby 's ? Andale , get out there . Go ! Go ! Hell . She 's wearing the killer dress . Damian , you bastard . The dress . It 's the dress . - The dress . - Get your hands off me . You switched the dresses . Why ? It 's my show . I do what I want . - Where 's my whistle ? - Is that how you 're doing it ? - What is it , Lizzie Borden 's dress ? - What are you talking about ? - You are gonna tell me everything . - All right . - I gave her the killer dress . - I knew it . Romana and I started out together . We were friends . Now she treats me like a minion . Rude , dismissive , snide comments about my work . I gave my best dress to the new girl . And I hope it hurt , like you 've hurt me . I did it ! I did it . - And you didn 't even need your sword . - Not bad . I am not fat . Give me that onstage . That 's what I want . So nothing but dead ends back here . There was an older woman in the crowd , rich , biggest ruby earrings I have ever seen , and there was something about the way that she was looking at me . Well , let 's go have a look at her , shall we ? Wait , just ... Will it hurt ? Are you okay ? I 'm burning up . Oh , my God , no . Stay with me . Stay with me . Stay with me . Stay with me . It 's worth every penny . Still me , Claudie . Are you in pain ? Other than a sudden desire to hit the early bird special , I 'm fine . What are we gonna do ? - How is she ? - She doesn 't have much time . Isabella died about an hour ago from old age , Artie . She was 22 . Now what do you need to undo this ? A sample of Myka 's blood would be ... What else ? Silver nitrate . It 's in Myka 's blood too , exactly the same as Isabella 's . - Silver nitrate ? - Yeah , it was a compound that was used as a disinfectant before the development of antibiotics . Wait , wait , wait , it was also used in the manufacture of photographic film . - I was doing something . - Gus used to say ... Gus was a former warehouse agent . And he used to say that there was a camera that belonged to ... There . Man Ray . - I 'm on it . Give me an address . - He 's dead . - What ? - He was a photographer in the 1930s . Guy shot some wicked cool pics . Contemporary of Dali , except that Ray was into photographic surrealism . And Gus used to say that one of Ray 's last cameras had artifact properties . It 's just we never found it . It 's gotta be one of the photographers . Which brings us back to what I was doing before Artie so rudely took my computer . I hacked into the fashion show security cameras . Now let me just get a good angle . There , that guy . Check the camera . - Not exactly state-of-the-art , right ? - Right . As soon as he takes Myka 's picture , he walks . It 's him . Can I interest you in changing your long distance carrier ? No thanks . Can I interest you in staying alive , huh ? - Where is it ? - What are you talking about ? I said where is it ? - Claudia , Man Ray 's . - Jackpot . And that is not all . Myka said there was an old lady giving her the stink eye , and she had on huge ruby earrings . This camera doesn 't just steal people 's youth . It transfers it to another person . You 've been peddling a second chance at life . How does the camera work , huh ? - How does the camera work ? - Lay off , we might need this guy . All right . You double-expose a younger photograph over someone older . The process is almost instantaneous . Myka and the others didn 't change right away . That would be a little too public , wouldn 't it ? What you did is you figured out how to do it later . Something to do with the development process , right ? Did you hear the question ? Do you doubt that he wants to beat you to death ? It works retroactively - if I wait and use the developer . - The silver nitrate . Right ? Silver nitrate . But why models ? Why not just snap pictures of anonymous young people ? You ever heard the expression " make love to the camera " ? A model has a gift . She bares her soul , opens up . Manny 's camera captures it , reacts to it . How do we turn Myka back ? Look out ! I know what happened . You , young man , have to stop playing with fire . Yeah , close call . I didn 't need the phoenix this time . I remembered to duck . Doctors say you 're doing great . Liar . How are you ? I just wish I could see my mom and dad . They could never cope with this . Artie , I just want to tell you that ... I know I 've been hard on you sometimes . Don 't . Don 't ... Don 't start that . I 'm not giving up on you . Don 't you give up . All right , listen . We have to find this ruby earring woman . We have to take a new photograph of her young and superimpose it on a photograph of old Myka . And it might switch her back ? Well , I 'm in his bank account . He hasn 't touched anything since the last deposit but ... - Something ? - He 's got a serious crush on someone . He 's had flowers delivered from the same shop three times this week . - Does it say to who ? - No , this just lists his transactions . Romana . - What ? - Romana had flowers delivered to her , and she wasn 't very happy with whoever sent them . I 'm on it . See ? - Even at 90 , you are a crack agent . - Pete , wait . What if you find him and he doesn 't tell who he sold Myka 's youth to ? Do we find someone else , take someone else 's youth ? I mean , someone bad ? - He 'll tell me . - Go . Consider me an ex-fan of Man Ray . Manny 's . - What ? - Perry didn 't say Man Ray 's camera . He said Manny 's . So ? - Perry , you scared me half to death . - I haven 't got time . Listen to me . - What do you want ? - I think you know . We 've been through this . You and I , we 're never gonna happen . That 's right . I 'm not your type , am I ? Rich and powerful . Guess what , I 'm both now . What is that supposed to mean ? I never used the camera for financial gain . What camera ? Until I met you . - You know what , I have to go . - I 'm finally ... wealthy enough now to have the most beautiful woman in the world . You 'll never have that much money . Don 't you understand ? Everything I did was for you , for us to be together . Just let go of me . Let go of me . You 've had Man Ray 's camera for a long time , haven 't you ? In fact , you actually knew Manny . I modeled for him when I was 22 . He gave me that camera . I kept it all these years . And that 's how you discovered its restorative properties ? And the first person that it turned young was you . I look pretty good for 98 . And how many innocent lives did your vitality cost ? I would imagine you double exposed my image with your friend 's . You 've been young long enough . Back again . - Are you okay ? - Well , yeah . Thanks to you guys . Well , you know , it 's in my contract . If my partner turns into a senior citizen and I don 't do anything about it , it 's , like , six vacation days , so I didn 't really ... It was all about the vacation . I 'm so glad to see you looking like the old you . I mean , the young old you , not the old , old you ... Gramps , you 're having a mini stroke again . You are aware that I 'm your boss , right ? You know that ? Yes , crabby , come on . You know , I just want to say thank you . - You 're welcome . - Not ... Not for ... For what you said before the show . We don 't have to ever mention that again . But remember you said that I ... - Can 't hear ... - I think that we should ... Warning ! Warning ! Danger , Will Robinson . Why are we doing this ? - You don 't see enough of me ? - Sit down . - I owe you an apology . - You owe me lots of apologies . Which one 's nagging at you ? The one about Todd . Not a big deal . It doesn 't matter . It does matter , because he 's a good kid , and I should be able to help . You didn 't make me a train wreck . You are not a train wreck , Claudia . I just sometimes forget that underneath the talented computer programmer and fearless junior Warehouse agent there beats the heart of a teenage girl who deserves , well , someone better than me for a ... Father figure ? Oh , my God . You 're not doing so bad . Well , I ... I could do a little better . You know , I can do better . - Sometimes you are so cute . - Don 't do that . I hate that word . Don 't use that word , cute . I 'm not cute . Well , I am relieved . When you said " meet me at the diner " , I thought you 'd arranged some lame meet with me and Todd . What a remarkable coincidence . I don 't know if I mentioned this before , but I really like chili . - Get out . - Yes , leaving .

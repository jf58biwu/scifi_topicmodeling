 crossing dimensions time and space technology beyond comprehension they are watching day are weighty you they are ready here dunno what 's ours not from this earth is just amazing no of team in the heart of Texas the small town of Stephenville is surrounded by wide open prairie longhorn cattle and Big Sky 's on January 8 2008 local resident Steve Allen gets together with friends Michael damn and Lance Jones to enjoy it clear mild night herself have been % uh very harsh cold winter and i cant of my friend mark on the phone earlier and he says come on over willow campfire outside and sit out enjoy this kind being a pilot I look up at the sky as quite a bit now that 's strange K and night I was the one to for SIA checked out look towards the east to see some whites coming at us at a very high rate of speed some very bright intense lights it looked like a magnesium flares unlike anything that I had ever seen moon and nobody wanted to say anything because we was it to kinda of stroke go to 3 4567 being a pilot first thing I thought I love is what kind of airplane was it a flat area quite a bit I 'm familiar with how long it takes to get from point A to B I estimated the speed to be in the several thousand miles an hour area how something could move that fast and not even produce air noise going across a surface no sound whatsoever the lights come to a near dead stuff over Stephen I didn 't know if it was a war the world 's work work on the seven lights reconfigured to a vertical shaken the lack configuration in the rear was different it 's ever writes a rear blinking with no particular time they sat there for a moment or two and then all of a sudden they burst into flames C flame look like it was a lock-up fired Padova dirty oxygen flowing and it just simply disappeared didn 't streak offer anything it just disappeared now I 'm I had never witnessed anything like this class Jones jumped in his car and took off he was alarmed scared you didn 't say goodbye see you later it 's been really anything he just got the heck out about Mike and I love to teach others ivory said what in the world happened it just made no sense to me we had to tell somebody so we went and to his house to tell his wife Claudia about what had happened call back guys how these lights came on the hack weird some tree-lined to cost club its reaction first was disbelief and that 's when she says oh you guys are more call Lance we invited her go ahead and call an C you know to to verify our story while aNZ has more credibility than mark and I do I don 't know Co while and before anything was said I think plans told Claudia hurry up run back outside it 's coming again better its came by cloture them original time and low this thing was up close and personal it wasn 't something striking out across the universe it was close to us and then all of a sudden two F-sixteens came by where governor had flames hanging up American jams and pursue them in the close proximity three different air force bases we never get any F-sixteens and area at that altitude much less in pursuit of another aircraft seem like it was giving them by like you control with speed for greater than they could home we want to go off into the east until it just went outside I 'm I had never witnessed anything like this not in the remote possibility or anything like this my what are military be chasing something about our own product obviously they wouldn 't so questions was what courted doing here fires in here and what are they walked visit danger to us I had many questions that need answers for welcome I 'm told Mike about it when I left it out we 're going to get to the bottom over you have done have emergency to go home my first feelings was if it 's there in dove times aside like to be at home and protect my house and my wife for and be with loved ones E I was still trying to process all we had seen him get it straight in my mind of all I Scotland from to me and the guys tonight was awesome stern 's lines in the sky I 'll too intense I 've never seen editing tool common Jets won after undergoing catch my wife could see that I was visibly shaken and knew I had actually seen something well UFO loaded cheap begged and pleaded with me to not tell anybody about it i 'm looking he can go around talking about UFO 's okay what we saw was real I 'm gonna find out exactly what a plus well she didn 't want me to speak about it because you 'd think people would think we was crazy course being a typical by all you gotta talk about it you know new exactly what you 're after is you not to do fast sought by myself Armada not saving thing but since there was three overs about all we love got to talk about it with the hopes that other people had seen it all my got probably 30 minutes sleep at night ives didn 't sleep very much at all well trying to figure out what had happened to us my first phone call the next morning was to that airport here in Stephenville Texas Island those guys at the airport they know who I am bueno out maybe a lot of things but I 'm not a liar no like things up so they they took interest to what are my love scenes so-called Fort Worth tower for the radar is actually located there to see if there was anything unusual in that area they did try to find out get me some answers but they they found of same seems terribly strange to me my next phone call was to the newspaper see if they had anybody that markets witnessed it all reported him when I told a reporter for us all she had not heard or seen anything ok what we had seen she found some credibility to my story and that 's when she decided she would take you around with him them lot of people solve what we saw but to quite a few people here don 't like her other line lie under be out in public that motor names mentioned her several over up persuaded to go ahead and come forward you know since you know a I 'm here by myself you guys help me out sure enough one came to my aid thank goodness on the evening of January 8th 2008 on the outskirts of Stephenville Texas Steve Allen and a group of friends observe military jets she sing with his arm configuration of lives the only witnesses to this strange event a call with newspaper here in town and not talk to the editor here out over the story and she asked me if i could print an article and I said make sure you 've got my phone number in here just in case somebody else might have solid they can call me are probably talk to at least 60 people first day I got all their names or addresses what they solved when I saw it tried to get as many details as I could also I asked him would you be willing to come forward most are reluctant to go public but local county constable Leroy gate steps up something in law enforcement firm tonight when using I am constable and I 'm elected by the people come on credibility in line here say mama joined a birthday yeah basis % um it was my wife 's birthday I was doing I bought a cake we could turn off it was DN 1 I 've wanted to get the sky you he said and he said look at those lots work up them I got a pair of binoculars Ando trying to get a better look ' em what was it we were seeing and I couldn 't make anything out other than these bright bluish fluorescent looking lacks I 'm during the so Tom Condon watching my boys use it in your own he 's asking me questions and is in a flying saucer what is ahead you know what are they doing know their kids Qassim House of Commons here thought to myself Ford have been experimenting what is something 's happened so quickly you know I 'm thinking myself nahmean tang 's isn 't something have this world was in the military for the local newspaper follows up on the story and contacts the Air Force name reported that they did not have any aircraft in the area and nothing was going on I found it quite or you know I I know quite an F-sixteen looks like a Lanao deny that they had military planes and and I knew for a fact that there was at least two in a nice because awesome then obviously send up a red flag to me what are they trying to hide of up I was enforced for truth Waterford to whether it was too Michael your like waterworld who 's willing to do it Steve contacts to mutual UFO network one of the oldest and largest UFO investigative organizations in the United States move funds since director of research Robert Powell to Stephenville to investigate the case the first thing we tried to do is determine possessing airplanes this smoothies running lights on missus star which has nothing to do with what we 're talking about lingering knee and little gray guys we 're talking about and the fiend an unidentified flying object that no one knows what it is but it 's a scientist you must investigate within days the investigation turns up 17 witnesses to corroborate Steve Ellen story elected officials other businessmen law enforcement officers lot of different witnesses what really made Stephenville such you need to your beloved was that not only did you have 17 witnesses you have witnesses who saw it different kinds over a three and a half hour period in over buried locations so this wasn 't case I 'm one single instance that was explored then another credible witness comes forward to challenge the military 's claim that nothing unusual was flying in this Stephenville skies on the night of January 8th 2008 mmm the US military denies dispatching F-sixteens over Stephenville Texas on the natives wearying that it constable you wakey and local pilots Steve Allen witnessed fighter jets chasing unknown object and they 're not alone we had 17 witnesses came details about what happened by but a few people did come forward is unlike anything this town are this area had ever saying and one reliable witness account stands above the rest the night to kenworthy a wanna officers was in the downtown area near the at-risk and courthouse room steam and he said to me that he saw large object to quoting he thought it was an airplane skin crash I 'm he said BGC down on the cell where many saw some lights again take a loan to know when an airplane because he said to resign on it straight up vertically close to the courthouse then it slowly moved towards the sky them p when it 's right or in that direction one very fast things missing twenty miles an hour from my experience flying over I keep up with the latest technology in the aircraft industry you know what their capabilities are force the government to has the best a very thing yeah its pretty well known what 's produced in what they have they may have a secret I don 't think they have one of these though that here space engineer doctor wallace fowler study spacecraft design and flight testing have in the past no security clearances and I 'm not about to say things that I shouldn 't be saying about things that I I know about back then back I 'm sure that there are things out there that the military ice doing that they 're not telling us about on yes our 71 for example was unknown thing for years the F one seventeens are known for years they were the strange sightings this strange airplane out the Nevada desert you know most probably somebody thought that was an alien spaceship wait we don 't think both news some vans that would never witness before you didn 't have to be a pilot first-grader could have told you what they saw with good accuracy the people and what 's up with hand-painted PDQ poet now if you more and more witnesses continue to go public who are approaching a hundred people probably the its you not seen something in regard to this you sooo many credible witnesses and sidings we all reporting and in the same area to multiple reports set off a media frenzy numerous people what was proposed by more mysterious lights in the sky with my montana Google and under the glare of the media the military releases new information for military finally released a report saying that they did in fact have p.m. F-sixteens in the area and I found that to be quite disturbing I just ran a fill betrayed why did they wait so long to come out obviously there was trying to hide something or cover something up if it 's something that would get there working for national defense at certainly they don 't need to tell me I mean or anyone else call they would have to do is say its wanna marriage goodbye you know into the into the story but the official response to UFO evidence has been consistent across the US government for decades investigative journalist Leslie Kean has spent the last 10 years documenting UFO sightings around in the early 1950s the therefore set up a program called Project Blue Book and the purpose of that program was to receive reports of on UFO sightings from the public of project though because very good at a ridiculing people or at least I 've issuing explanations for cases that were worry ludicrous day we 're basically a public relations operation for the Air Force to some minimize the mysterious aspect UFO 's of the military shutdown project Bluebook in 1970 fee in the case in Stephenville the Air Force claims witnesses were tricked by an optical illusion of they said it was a reflection of over helped to jet airliner very well could have been a reflection of a mass Anne white ass is what it might have been another military explanation is lenticular clouds stationary lens shaped clouds that form at high altitude but these don 't travel with two F-sixteens chasing so that was just totally absurd moon phone investigator Robert Powell presses the Air Force for answers no longer denying the presence of the F-sixteens what else is the military no my first reaction once I need to get radar information so I said Freedom of Information requests to every military base within seventy miles stephen p of in every case with military the response was we have no information responsive to your request now what does that mean it 's not even a yes right now my immediate thought was I wondered can I get radar information from the FAA in tried to verify what these witnesses same the civilian Federal Aviation Administration releases full radar reports for the night of January 8th 2008 from airports near Stephenville I don 't think they knew this but they was giving it for so I think we smoking i mean got it without them knowing what we was doing the radar data is a play by play the activity in the sky on the date that the mass sighting by no this is a great chance to see if I can corroborate what these witnesses saw a person might lie to you with the radar data Howell begins by identifying the obvious you can see commercial craft on the radar recurrent most of them were at high altitude they will either descending or ascending how the DFW Fort Worth expertise next the data confirms the military 's recent admission the radar data DNA in fact show that there was 10 F-sixteens in the area then the radar reveals something more during that time period have 6 p.m. to 9 : 30 p.m. we picked up the toll have three unusual our Jeeps that move through the Stephenville area without transponders up powell knows the US government requires all aircraft to use transponders the transponders very similar to a GPS system in space ically just a radio signal going back to the radar station in all three of those objects did not have a transponder in of three were objects in the same area is the witnesses of and then the data uncovers a possible target commander things look at this and identified aircraft approaching prohibited area p 49 Crawford Texas one craft without a transponder was headed straight into one of North America 's most heavily guarded no fly zones one of the items that you saw on the radar strapping directed towards a crock Grange it was traveling straight line we head over 140 radar hits Crawford range referred to is the Western White House home with the President of the United States George W Bush on the same day witnesses report seeing a UFO fly-over Stephenville Texas regarded fears f-16 fighter jets and a mysterious craft faring down on the no fly zone over Crawford 's red each Crawford ranchers were George W Bush are ex-president lives its he still here about 60 miles there 's a no fly zone three miles in every direction around it even if the president is not there of to break that no fly zones syriza perhaps area this would be the ultimate national security compromise of a pilot flies through that area they 'll either force you down or they 'll shoot you down this object it 's moving towards the Western White House we have F-sixteens within 30 35 miles up with us on our judy is but on radar you can see that night at the F-sixteens react in is this object DC and suddenly it just moves perpendicular to high rate of speed nm 1 30 seconds it 's gonna if the F-sixteens works chasing the strange object was the air force 's corning one of its poem top-secret aircraft densely populated area why would they have an album could be in the desert where it would be same you know quite heavily in this area if this was a military aircraft inmates long ago over civilian space that would be huge military blunder hoping to learn more about this strange object Steve Alan Robert Powell returned to the radar evidence and to me the speed was a a very critical thing radar sweet sentencing so once I know for this object is here where it 's at can second slave 10 seconds later it 's just a question doing some quick math to calculate how far did move over the course 15 to 20 seconds but I concluded was the object accelerated to close to nineteen hundred miles per hour and continued on them on its way next Powell works to determine the object 's size I wasn 't able to do it with the radar information because what the FAA culex does not tell you anything about science but there was one witness who claim to have some evidence we could you flights after must or when public I had another officer that works with us and I had known of and I 'm he tomei that not continuing he song Marcus we need to cram museums floating near the ground he said he was very long very TN unit had hubble bubble he said it was a very large he described the non ci almost a city block in size he said it was something that was very big it was something I would do in very strange things instrument hire XP custom lafayette louisiana I trying to analyze the size in this crap to multiple witness now would take the witnesses visual description and then I would look where the RG minds based on the radar information based on that I could ask me size at the RG using trigonometry ok the minimum size at this RG was at least 8 the mile to a quarter of a mile size think about something beside that with the radius have two football teams you take for Buffy on 18 spin around one goalpost and then you got something about that size my the question is are there are man-made aircraft with such amazing characteristics the sr-71 clue 2100 miles the sr-71 is totally capable of breaching that kinda speeds the next 15 please 6,000 miles an hour more the space shuttle flew 17,500 miles an hour fasted so there are being calls that we have build that comply a lot passed fact in order to do what it 's been reported a vehicle would have to have number one a lot of fun thrust is is the huge thing you 'd be after be able to have a lot of thrust for a vehicle that six hundred feet long or wide to go 1909 som also the total silence is what was very intriguing have something could move that fast and not even produce Aaron always going across the surface is just totally silent for we was Adam when out vehicle gets fat to the speed of sound Mach 1 what happens is a shockwave forms at about the Eagle the shock wave is perceived by us humans as sonic bomb anything traveling at faster than speed sound especially at a low level you were here someone would have heard the sonic booms the vehicle itself is reported to be totally silent professor of physics and astronomy John Willis studies the vast distances about your space you had this imaginary space ship could travel close to the speed of light it would take you for years to get to than there are stars if you were traveling at a much lower speeds that we can achieve Rocket Summer you would be looking perhaps many thousands of years its possible for it would take many times longer than the single human generation of as a human race we haven 't yet thought about the challenge of taking that amount of time to transport humans across the country distance we can make some guesses about how many planets might host months but you actually predict when will we make contact with an alien civilizations most scientists aren 't willing to make that speculation I feel like a quarter we saw is not from this her if due to the factories flight capability is the speed it was traveling get being able to flyer silently the unknown is very intriguing and Lisa lotta questions subject internet and a newspaper article shows that in like a team and your 1891 in fact there had been some some sightings previously me reserve gentleman near the cotton compress over there they 've had witnessed flying object of some sort 10 and it burst into flames him he could describe it as a bale of cotton on fire have seen cotton burning it 's the same colour important I did witness so his description was just be alone as far as took over a flame on what it tells me is there has been multiple sightings around here that 's not the only citing so whatever it is I feel like it comes and goes from this earth on two weeks after the sighting constable Leroy gate routinely patrols the streets it 's Stephen knowing something in common attention and scant the witness count continues to rise and over 100 Fort seeing unidentified flying object is the Stephenville skies on January 8th 2008 FAA reader confirms the presence of 10 f-16 jets and a massive object in the area that night but the military denies any no mysterious craft then two weeks after the Mass citing constable watergate responds to a suspicious call in downtown Stephenville on there was some way probably three o 'clock in the morning win over the radio I hear an alarm call coming in up there was a business were and one was going off after arms Mb in that was close by don 't hang on to stop in which in the back and you can I 'm and I will check out the bill M them something common attention unscom it was changing color from red blue possible green this time gay teen goes after hard evidence that the UFO them these cameras are not made for point open skies are made in point in accord license plates I 'm I was able to you focus on this subject and sorry record gets here on a monitor in Macomb then he was a larger or that seem to be floating not they 're not your typical store much larger mom it was movin from east to west snow I 'm anarchist didn 't know what was it look to be someone posting appeared to be almost harlow but i sat there in a videotaped it for 15-20 minutes the lots didn 't leave a tale cousin to cart so fast when home I 'm developed better video in what was really strange it was it had a lot of static inference for some strange reason no I just wasn 't clear video that India also Mike front-page headlines in the area in spite of the heezy image the latest sighting brings a new sense of purpose to the investigation he was making progress everybody knew but they saw during that time everybody had their own assignment of robert was doing his radar analysis so I was still taking a lot of testimony a lot of what people saw also we was busy just trying to figure out what happened Victor military simply tried to explain it away they 've got a smear campaign for cover up campaign to discredit whatever was same UFO phenomena it 's something the US government cannot explain I believe they know you exist but they can 't explain it and it 's a marquee they don 't want on their back we were just almost ridiculed the day off about what happen they never ask what we saw all those just too busy trying to explain it away for question if the UFO cover-up by the US government is a very tricky and difficult question to deal with if there 's an event that happens that 's widely reported that there are numerous witnesses amor very clear about what happened of the US government will not want to be involved it 's almost like they want to hide something that everybody knows it happened there are probably classified documents dealing with health a deal with the UFO subject so the bottom line is the US government does not reveal everything and no cool but Steve Allen refuses to give up his quest for the truth his perseverance pays off when he receives a startling phone call the person on the other end of the line is none other than nasa astronaut Edgar D Mitchell we talked for quite some time probably an hour and a half of a tolling are all I have seen he actually knew what I was talking about I 'll Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell is an American hero he was the six man to walk on the moon and for many years he has been very outspoken about the UFO subject East interested in it has done internal investigations private investigations with people at high levels this he had quite a few interesting stories to tell me about for nah so force them to say and what they don 't warm citing he relayed some facts about buzz aldrin mean you 're the first people on the move that some something had landed within a mile lover have buyers he told accused remanded Houston instructed them said don 't look at it don 't look there a way to have no contact with carry on with your mission this regard whatever was over there and what about Mitchell 's only apollo mission in 1971 he is saying there craft while he was held in space he saw different things definitely was stars ring thingy solve rufo doctor ritual is very credible nasa doesn 't control anymore nor the government you know so he really doesn 't give a darn he 'll just tell you what he saw you know I feel like whatever he says is the truth I knew what my story was that was the most important thing I 'll big surprise was later on this when the report came out contained the radar data doing in fact show something unlike anything that I had ever saying total surprise a shock X since Steve that one first reported seeing a UFO over Stephenville Texas on the night of January 2008 more than 100 witnesses come forward to corroborate his account but the question remains : what was in the sky that night I 'm after months of compiling eyewitness testimony and analyzing radar returns both the data and the witness accounts reveal a crucial anomaly the speed was a a very critical thing very important that something this large camp flyer advance come to a stop go back to the way over excelerate two F-sixteens very unusual good them the object whatever it was went from basically standing still to nineteen hundred miles an hour in about two seconds more anything that could fly there fast and then come to a complete stop back quick over such a short area you know it 's a lot of work G-forces the concept G-forces party Newton 's laws of gravity a law that here on earth at least can 't be broken she foresees basically acceleration if you 're in an airplane that course quote 2 G 's at that point here the force on your bottom pushing up on you is twice your way if it 's 3G uses three times when in F-sixteen for example I can stand nine genes fairly easily their usual a blackout 10 G 's blood comes out of your head and a your you basically are no longer in control aircraft I don 't know anything that six hundred feet across that can hover that can go nineteen hundred miles an hour in two seconds and then stop again nope nothing that we know what they can do that he could do the calculations roughly that 's about forty three cheese within seconds your you kill a human being what I finally concluding completed Stephenville report was him whatever causes was not caused by the US Air Force doesn 't mean that was an extraterrestrial RG no one can prove what happened Stephenville was an extraterrestrial large however what I can say is a it was not unique fame the remaining factored on her home from when the report came out I felt good about it did tell exactly what we saw you know exact location exact times everything was there id nine new good I had seen something strange because some people just maybe not believe in someone fail vindicated because the evidence was here we rain our analysis by three different FAA air traffic controllers we as sand fleas look at the history find in here for in and those three could find an error in a report as it turns out powell 's report may have been to taking a cue from the US military the FAA Titans their policy surrounding access to radar data information after our Stephenville report the next time I requested radar information from the FAA using the Freedom of Information Act request they refused to give me the same type radar information stating that they felt it was a threat to the national airspace for me to have any information they may have accidentally sent us all that data and we compiled it and sure enough there it was it substantial waited but we saw I don 't think they want to make that mistake again your for its part the military continues to deny that any unknown object never passed to Stephenville airspace on 2008 more than nine months after the first UFO sighting a crowd of Friday night football fans packed the stands at the local area high school they was havin football game whatever it was the UFO over the craft pulled up over the years Stadium sets the craft came directly from over here completely stopped football game players stop first arrest was busy reffing a game and then they watch the players are looking up everybody in the stands saw it football player software for is sought hundreds if not thousands people saying the same thing this is a real situations are some kind of hallucinations same I 'm enjoying your birthday yeah basis you since January he ate in the southern France my life is strange monthly soon change now I 'm open to the possibility that the Reitz lot be on our earth and I hope that before I leave this greater than Diane an answer what it was said in a song I knew it was a life-altering experience I knew it was something that not many people had the pleasure of witnessing that I was blessed being able to see it probably life in other universe is your Galaxy two solar systems you that could be very narrow-minded think that we 're only people out there steve allen 's quest for the truth isn 't over are sincerely hope I get to see it again I wanna know what it is I S I look up at the sky as quite a bit now

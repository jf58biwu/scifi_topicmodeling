 Stephen : My name is stephen jameson . I 'm one of the tomorrow people , They call our powers the three t 's . Telepathy ... Cara : Stephen ? Stephen : Telekinesis ... And teleportation . There is a shadow war going on between us and ultra ... No ! ... The secret organization that hunts us . The only way to keep my species from going extinct Is to find my father . And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy . Previously on the tomorrow people ... I don 't know what to tell you . How about the truth ? That I 'm a killer ? I don 't care what your secret was . It 's that you kept it from me . You 're the best person I 've ever met . I think about you , cara . I think about you too . I 'll get them to the subway , then I 'll walk you to your car . My car 's a block over . You don 't want to be out alone with this lunatic still loose . Okay . ( whistling ) ( whistling ) ( whistling ) ( whistling ) I don 't want to hurt you . Please don 't run . If you run , I get upset . Don 't come any closer ! There now , you see what you did ? Now I 'm upset . ( shower running ) ( thinking ) morning . Cara ? Hello ? ( shower stopping ) Can I come in ? Why didn 't you answer me ? I was getting all telepathically romantic . I was in the shower . Running water can be a psychic barrier . Didn 't know that . So , how ' bout we order some room service and watch a bad movie ? There 's a couple from arizona about to check in . You should get dressed . Okay . So last night was pretty ... Awesome , right ? But , you know , just to make sure it wasn 't a fluke , We should probably do it another dozen times . I don 't know if it 's that simple . For me anyway . Okay , yeah . So what now ? I 'm not sure . ( door opening ) quick . They 're here ... ( stammering ) hi , I was just checking out . John : Hey . I missed you . Got you this . Oregon state animal . I know the last few weeks have been tough , so I wanted to start over . This little guy is a peace offering . He 's a beaver . It 's cute . Thanks . So it turns out our resident klepto is actually a mad musical genius . Like a violin prodigy or something ? Oh , ' cause I 'm asian I must play the violin . Piano ? Real good at math too . So , where have you been ? Nowhere . You got in pretty late last night . I saw your bed was empty . Yeah , I , um , I spent the night at a hotel . I needed some me time . There 's something in here you ought to see . Wait . Slow down . Back up . You 're saying you 've been tracking a breakout on your own ? I had to . There was no one else here . I didn 't get any signals . That 's probably because he broke out years ago , So his psychic footprint 's not spiking . Truth is , this guy has reason not to be found . Tim : The suspect in question strikes between ten at night and two in the morning . All around this eight block radius . What do you mean , " strikes ? " Tim : Here 's the police composite sketch . Along with the sexual assault reports . We 're looking for a rapist ? No , that doesn 't make any sense . Are you sure he 's one of us ? The way he vanishes into thin air , he 's gotta be . So much for homo-superior . Our powers don 't make us good . They just make us powerful . How we use them is up to us . This guy is twisted . With or without ' em . What doesn 't make sense is how ultra still hasn 't tracked him down . So we catch him , and then what ? I mean , it 's not like we have a prison . Personally , I 'd like to castrate him , but that might not be that practical . It 's disgusting . Not the castration part , I think that 's entirely justified . I just mean that one of our kind , a supposedly more evolved species Would use their powers for ... That . I couldn 't agree more . So why not let ultra do what they do best ? We 're better than them . We 're faster , and it could mean one less woman gets attacked . In that case we should get a hold of ultra 's intel . See what else they have on this sick bastard . As in contact stephen . Me ? Yeah . You are all in his head . I 'd rather focus on trying to get a read on this guy . I 'll contact him . Thanks , irene . I got it . Man : I thought you 'd be used to this by now . Getting agents killed . What 'd you just say ? Can 't wait for the day when it 's your crap being boxed up . You son of a bitch . She was my partner . And look how well that worked out for her . You 're too young . You 're too green . And your partners end up too dead . You 're way out of your depth , man . I don 't care who you 're related to . Yeah ? Why don 't you do something about it ? All right , gentlemen . Enough . I think we can find a better outlet for our grief than this , yes ? Look , I know we all miss agent nichols , But the best way to honor her memory is to continue doing what we 're doing . Which is what , exactly ? It just so happens we have a very dangerous Criminal breakout on the streets right now . He 's wanted in a string of assaults clustered here . He seems to be following a geographic pattern . Now , all the victims say the assailant moved like lightning . One second they 're in the street , the next second They 're in a dark concrete room where he violates them , and then like magic , They wake up in their bedrooms with their hair wet . So , needless to say , if the local pd gets this lunatic before we do , It could compromise our entire organization . That 's the priority ? Not stopping more women from being raped ? Should you be watching your tone , son ? Maybe I should get some air . Hey . I didn 't say " meeting dismissed . " Perkins is right , okay ? I 'm toxic . First vaughn , then darcy . Look what happens to the people around me . Those guys don 't want me here , okay ? I 'm a liability . Well , perhaps a few days away from headquarters would do you some good . But , remember , stephen , you 've seen what we do to rogue agents here . You 'd be no different . So get it together fast . You 're wearing on morale . Didn 't mean to scare you . You didn 't . We need your help . Ultra 's tracking a breakout who actually deserves to get caught . We just gotta make sure they bring him in . Sorry . Taking a little time off . My boss slash uncle . He thinks the stress of the job is getting to me . What do you think ? I think that jedikiah only knows about half My life , the ultra half , which is bad enough , but then There 's the whole " survival our species depends on you " thing with you guys . Stephen . I get it . It 's a lot of pressure . And our world can be a little intense . But it 's up to you . You can 't choose your destiny . You can only fulfill it or fail it . You hearing me , stephen ? Yeah , I hear you . All right . I am starving . Wow . Haven 't seen you look this glum Since your volcano didn 't erupt in sixth grade earth science . I know you can hear me . Well , I used corn starch instead of baking soda , so the volcano ... I 'm serious . I have these powers , okay , which , theoretically , should make my life awesome , But some reason , everything I touch I seem to destroy . Well , maybe you 're not using them to full effect . If I could make stuff fly , I would have some fun with it . I can read minds , okay ? Now , that should be cool . But who wants to know that jamie wright cheated on his bio quiz and Thinks he might have crabs ? Okay . Yeah , I can see how that could get burdensome . Yeah . Just to be clear , my mind is totally off limits . Right ? Yes , okay ? I would never . It 'd be like seeing you naked . It 'd just be wrong . Oh , what 's wrong with me naked ? Coach : Jameson ! I so hate to interrupt your little tea time . But how 'd you like to come down here and head up the b-team ? Sure , coming right down , coach . I 'll be here . Well , here 's your chance . With great power , comes great responsibility . To have yourself some fun . Can 't wait . Picking you first . David . Move it , dumpling . Astrid . Van . Rory . I forgot my inhaler ... Let 's go , rory . That 's five on five . All right . Let 's do battle . Okay , bring it in , bring it in . Now , have any of you guys seen the bad news bears ? Yeah . They lose in the end . Thank you , rory . But you know what else they did ? They showed the other team what they were made of , okay ? Their grit . Now , let 's get out there and kick some ass ! Come on , ror ! Coach : Center court , let 's go kids . Rousing speech , dickhead . Uh-uh . You got it , rory ! Put it up ! Suck it , juergens ! Told you this could be awesome . Yeah , maybe I 've just been using these powers the wrong way . And now you 're showing off . Did you just slap my ass ? Uh ... Got a little carried away . Let 's never speak of it . Jameson ! That was nice . Here 's the deal , jimmy brandt sprained his ankle , And risdall 's got the flu , so varsity squad is a body short . You come work out with us , we 'll suit you up for the game this weekend , okay ? No , thanks . I appreciate it ... Hey , we can 't mount a squad , we forfeit the game . Hmm ? Let 's play ball ! ( whistle blowing ) John : Now what ? We 're totally screwed . All these trees , there 's zero visibility , Tim got nothing on surveillance . This pervert knows what he 's doing . Meanwhile , we 're out in the open waiting to get caught up in an ultra sweep . You wanna leave , john ? Leave . Well , wherever this guy 's taking his victims it must be close . We should split up . So I don 't have to listen to you two bicker anymore . What ? We 're not splitting up ? You tell me , cara . Is that a joke ? You haven 't forgiven me . For not telling you the truth about being able to kill . While I was away with russell , I thought about you . Us . A lot . I realized how much I let us down . I know I have to earn your trust back , But there 's nothing we can 't get through , right ? I know I 'm not the " I love you " kind of guy , But , yeah , I do . Now you tell me ? Come on , no one 's perfect . ( laughing ) This is so trippy . Is your whole body tingling ? Yes , all of it . Look at your hair . Is it good ? It 's good now . Well , you did just atomize me to the top of the empire state building and back . I told you this could be fun . So , where we going next ? We can go wherever you ... Um , sorry . I didn 't ... Hi . Uh ... I 'm astrid . Cara . I 've heard a lot about you . Yeah ? Um , astrid , do you mind giving us a minute ? Of course . I should be getting home anyway , so ... It was nice to meet you , cara . I wasn 't expecting you . ( clearing throat ) stephen , we need you back inside ultra . Unless we know where they are with tracking this guy There 's no telling when he 'll attack next . So , you 're just here on official tomorrow people business ? What happened between us , Should never have happened . It was a mistake . It was my fault , and I take full responsibility . So , I 'm a mistake now ? No . The other night . Us . That was a mistake . It was my mistake . How did we get to " mistake " from " I 'm not sure " ? It 's not like we just hooked up . Okay ? There has been something between us from the very beginning . Before I even saw your face when you were just a voice inside my head . Stop . No . Look me in the eye and tell me you don 't feel it . Let me inside your mind so I know you 're not covering up the truth . And if you can do that , in all honesty , then I 'll never bring it up again . I 'm sorry , stephen . I don 't get it , jameson . When did you stop sucking ? It 's a recent development . Oh , hell , no . My dad 's moved their book club to my house tonight . Gonna have to cancel the pep party . What 's our back-up plan ? What 's a pep party ? Just a little get together for the team . Get us focused on the big game . Kind of a tradition . You were so invited . Well , my mom 's working the night shift . Maybe we could do it at my place ? ( loud music playing ) Whoa . Trippy . Oh , hey . Hi . Yeah , thanks for the invite . Sorry , it was just supposed to be a few guys . Not according to twitter . Ha . I am so screwed . Will you just make sure no one pukes on the couch please ? Yo , don 't forget the host . Oh , no thanks , I 'm not drinking with the big game in the morning . Neither are we . Just keepin ' up appearances . Man , it 's apple juice . Okay . I mean tequila . ( coughing ) ( all laughing ) Oh , man , my bad . Here , wash it down with more tequila ! Can 't even taste the third one . I promise . Did you know that someone 's turning our bathtub into a gravity bong ? What ? How do you know what a ... It doesn 't matter . If you breathe a word of this to mom ... Oh , please . You 're finally a baller . Why would I ruin it ? Hey mini-dude , you beer pong ? No . Off-limits . I 'm luca . Hi , luca . I 'm juergens . This is van . This is david-with-two-dads . I know who you guys are . Hi , stephen . Uh , jenny , hi . There 's an emergency situation upstairs that you might wanna check out . Like , stat . Yeah . Thank you . So , what 's the emergency ? That I might never get up the nerve to do this again . This spot is the central intersection of the four attacks . Focus your energy there . If he strikes again , you should be able to get a fast read on him . Aw , I can 't wait to get my hands on this creep . Bam ! Pow ! Karate chop castration , right to the cojones . It 's a patented technique . Irene 's tapped into the police scanners . Why don 't you go help her ? Third wheel , preparing for take-off . I told you we 'll find him and we will . What ? You know how we said we would tell each other everything ? That we could get past anything as long as we were honest with each other ? Yeah . While you were gone , I made a mistake . Cara , there 's nothing you could of done . I slept with stephen . I 'm so sorry . If I could take it back , I would . And it doesn 't change how I feel about you . The thought of losing you terrifies me . Say something . Are we even now ? I lied to you , you lied to me , is that how it is ? No . No , that 's not ... It took me years to tell you the truth about the annex project . It took you two days to come clean about this . So , in that respect , you win . Now what ? I guess that 's up to you . Stephen ? Uh , the cops are just about to bust your party . I , uh , I thought you should know . Damn it . Excuse me , jenny . Call me . What ? Nothing . Okay , go ahead . Judge . Like you need me . Jenny riordin ? Seriously ? How wasted was she ? Okay , she kissed me . Oh , right . Now was this before or after she forced you to do tequila shots ? You 're not gonna take responsibility for any of this ? You 're the one who told me to have more fun with my powers . To have more fun . Not to be a jerk . You know , you 're turning into the people we roll our eyes at . You kind of suck at being a superhero . Yeah . I know . That 's what I 've been trying to tell everyone . You mean your new friend , cara ? Okay , what is your issue ? ( astrid thinking ) I 'm in love with you . Stephen , did you just ... No . No . Astrid , I ... You 're an ass . It was an accident , okay ? I swear . Okay . Let 's not make this any more awkward than it already is . ( whistling ) I just felt ... Someone teleported . ( whistling ) If you 're calm , I won 't kill you . ( screaming ) shh . It 's okay . Let her go . No . I 'm sorry . Maybe you didn 't hear me , you rapist piece of ... Why didn 't you tell me you were like me ? One of the blessed ones . Oh , a little crime-fighting crew ? You get a read on him ? Where 'd he go ? I don 't know . Russell : He couldn 't have gone far . Must have left some kind of signature . Is she okay ? Hey . Can you hear me ? You 're safe now . ( concentrating ) ( knocking at door ) Hmm . Looks like somebody 's been a very bad boy . Using your powers to win basketball games and throw parties . Just because you 're on leave , doesn 't mean we 're not keeping tabs on you , kid . Hold out your wrist . Why ? So you can slap it ? Get off me ! ( beeping ) ( grunting ) That is a suppression cuff . Another one of your dad 's nifty inventions . You 're so sick of your powers , Well , now you 're gonna feel what it 's like not to have them . Okay , I know I screwed up . But I need my powers . Cuff must be working . If you could read my mind , you would have moved . Ow ! ( groaning ) Sweet bracelet . ( groaning ) yeah , it 's one of those , uh , balance band things . Great . By the way , mom left you a little present . I thought she was sleeping at the hospital between shifts ? Yeah , no , she came home for breakfast . You know when she does that quiet angry thing And you wish she 'd just yell ? Yeah , she did that . Great . Anyway . Get out . ( groaning ) ( sighing ) Yeah , the cuff doesn 't come off till your uncle wants it to come off . The material is a titanium blend , Essentially unbreakable , impervious to powers . If we knew the alloy , we could circumvent it . We don 't . You wanted a simpler life . You got it . And you guys know everything , huh ? When you 're a man down , chasing a psychotic serial rapist , You gotta do your homework . Look , I get it . Hey , I needed a break . I 'm good now . I 'm ready to help . Without your powers , you 're useless . What ? We 're all thinking it . I wasn 't thinking it . What are the badges for ? John : The guy we 're chasing had one on his shirtsleeve . I couldn 't get a read on it . He 's extremely fast , and we are extremely busy . Don 't you have a game to get to ? Sorry we can 't help you with the cuff . Make peace with jedikiah and it 'll go away . Until then , lay low . Lay low ? On a basketball court in front of my whole school ? Awesome . I 'll take you topside . Thanks for doing this . No problem . I got your back for the big game . Just like you got mine . Astrid : Go wildcats ! ( crowd cheering ) ( crowd groaning ) ( buzzer sounding ) Time , ref ! Come on . Let 's go . Hurry up ! Coach : Guys . All right , questions . Why are we dragging ass on d , huh ? And jameson ? Donde esta the magic ? Yeah , just warming up , okay ? It 's killing us , jameson . Coach : We 've worked on this . Heads in the game . Let 's go . On three , wildcats . One , two , three ! All : Wildcats ! Let 's go boys . Let 's go . Go wildcats . Sweet , bro . Next stop nba . What the hell was that about ? Oh , just having a little fun . Like you did . While I was away . Look , it just happened . Okay ? It 's not like I planned it . Whatever the hell happened between you two , it didn 't mean a thing . You had sex . That 's all . Congratulations . ( clapping ) I hope it made you feel like a big man . I 'd be careful , stephen . You saw what happened without your powers . You 're nothing . Yeah ? And who are you ? A rebel leader who doesn 't fight ? With the trail of bodies you 've left in your wake , above ground and below , Pardon me for not taking leadership advice from you . ( grunting ) If either one of you says , " he started it . " I will tear you both to shreds . This is my fault . What happened between us was a one-time mistake . I am with john . Fighting each other is a path to extinction , which is why this ends now . Do you hear me ? Jedikiah : They wake up in their bedrooms with their hair wet . I was in the shower . Running water can be a psychic barrier . He takes them to the sewers . ( water dripping ) ( woman shrieking ) Woman : ( sobbing ) please ! ( woman gasping ) hey ! We have a guest . ( whimpering ) Run . Run ! An unfriendly guest . I don 't think you know who you 're dealing with , friend . You think your powers make you special ? Don 't they ? He got you pretty good . Are you okay ? You 're sick . And you 're weak . ( grunts ) That 's gonna make it easier than I thought . Bad dog . Stephen . He found the breakout . He needs our help . Stephen has a suppression cuff on . How 's he communicating ? I don 't know . But he is . You can 't kill me . I know you can 't . Someone 's gonna find you sooner or later . You have to give up . I can do whatever I want . Whenever I want . Now , I may not be able to kill you . But let 's see if this current can . It 's too easy . Cara : Stephen ! I got him . ( groans ) I 'm gonna make you beg . ( feedback blaring ) Not a hell hot enough , is there ? Man : Stay back . I don 't want you here , stephen . You need to go back . Dad ? Son . Dad , I need your help . Please . Save yourself . Save all of them . How ? Dad , tell me what to do . Please . Thanatos . Dad , I don 't know what that means . Dad , come on , give me something . Please ! ( sputtering ) ( choking ) Lucky guy . Good job . Who figured out where he was hiding ? I did . That 's a story I 'd like to hear . So you did this all on your own ? You tracked down and apprehended a violent breakout All without the benefit of your powers ? What can I say ? Powers are overrated . But I 'd still like mine back . So , I can assume your little walk through the wilderness is over ? Yes . I 'm ready to come back as an agent as soon as possible , sir . Good , good . I 'm curious , though . Why the change of heart ? I thought you didn 't have the stomach for this kind of work . My destiny isn 't something I choose . I can only choose to fulfill or fail it . You should know I would have removed your powers permanently if I had to . Well , good thing you don 't have to . Do you mind ? ( beeping ) One more thing , stephen . The man you brought in Was ranting about being attacked by someone with paranormal powers . No . A woman . Dark hair , piercing blue eyes . Does that ring a bell ? Like I said , I brought him in alone . Hmm . I wonder where he came up with that story . Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he 's insane ? Mmm . What happens to him now ? Oh , something you definitely don 't have the stomach for . Cara : John ! So , are we good ? Well , technically , now we 've both made out with stephen . So , I 'm willing to call it even . He 's in love with you . You know that , right ? Yeah . Don 't you think that 's kind of a problem ? We all have to work together . Without stephen , there is no endgame . John . He 's not imagining it . Whatever it is between stephen and me , There is something . I 'll lie to him . I will tell him it doesn 't exist if that 's what it takes to keep the harmony down here . To survive . I can 't lie to you . Do you love me , cara ? Yes . That 's all I need to know . Thank you . Peace offering ? I 'm not in the mood . Little known fact . Pork buns were served at the geneva convention . These little guys are the unsung heroes of all great peace treaties . You mind if I sit ? If I said no , would it stop you ? Definitely not . Ouch . I 'm fine . Look , I let my powers go to my head a little . You think ? Okay , a lot . Becoming a jerk wasn 't part of my plan . I 'm sorry . Thank you for reminding me who I was before I had them . Yeah , it was like the plot of an ' 80s movie . You went from geek to chic then back to geek . You got the popular girl and here you are , begging for your best friend back . Except you ruined the ending , ' cause You already know how she really feels about you . I love you too , astrid . Oh , barf , here comes the " like a friend " qualifier . No , it 's not just that , okay ? There 's someone else . Yeah , the girl in your room . Cara . Yeah . If it makes you feel any better , she doesn 't love me back . Is that what she told you ? You don 't have to be a mind-reader to know she 's lying . ( knocking ) Do me a favor . The next time you want to go after a psychotic breakout on your own Without your powers , don 't . Sure thing . But I wasn 't on my own . You 're lucky I even knew you were in trouble . That cuff should have blocked me from hearing your voice . That 's what I 've been saying all along . We 're connected . Look , you can fight it , deny it all you want , cara . But you and I , We 're inevitable . That 's the last time I 'll bring it up , okay ? Okay . Bad timing , I 'm guessing . No . I actually came here to talk to both of you . It 's about my dad . He 's alive . I saw him . And we 're gonna figure out how to find him .

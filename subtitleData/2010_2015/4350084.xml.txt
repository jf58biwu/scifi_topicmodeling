 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . It would seem our fates are on a collision course . Find Dyson Frost ... yesterday . The next move is Mark Benford 's . Dyson Frost ? It 's your move . I took this picture . She saw something she shouldn 't have and got in trouble with Jericho . The second that Jericho knows I 'm alive , they 'll find me and they 'll kill me . [ Aaron ] Tracy Stark . I know you took her . - Now , you 're gonna give her back . - I can 't give you your daughter back . Then we go to war . You will be shot three times on March 15th . It will be your gun , Agent Benford . - Demetri ? - Yeah ? The box is here , but the gun is gone . My first term was a bitch . I could have used you , Stan . I 'm sorry I couldn 't bring you in . I don 't want you to think I 'm harassing you . I know . You 're just trying to save the world . Goodbye . [ Mark ] She was signaling her handlers . [ Simon ] I should have known . Two moles , in case one is caught . And not one person in the office would suspect it 's you . [ Mark ] Today is more than just the beginning of your career . Today , along with a badge and a gun you 're gonna get a story about your first day on the job . Every special agent has one . Some are funny . Some are tragic . Some are boring . But today won 't be the most important day in your career as an FBI agent . That day is somewhere down the line . You won 't see it coming . It sneaks up on you . It 'll most likely be an anonymous moment , a crossroads where you 're asked to do something , make some kind of personal sacrifice for the good of someone else , and that person may never know your name or see your face or even understand what you did . But you 'll know . And isn 't that why you 're here , after all ? Because you can be counted on to do the right thing at the right time , every time . Welcome to the FBI . [ Applause ] Well done . Nicely done . All right , ladies and gentlemen . See me for your partner assignments . - Congratulations . - [ Chuckling ] - [ Wedeck ] Nicely done . - [ Demetri ] Special Agent Vreede . Is it " Vreed-y " or " Vreede " as in " freed ? " - I don 't know . I got Benford . - No . Switch with me . - Why ? - He 's a legend . He 's done it all : Surveillance , counterterrorism , trafficking . Come on . Do it . Whatever , but you gotta take it up with Wedeck and get it approved . Done . Thank you . - Of course . - Yes ! Janis , who 'd you get ? No partner . Headed to analysis . Boring . You know , I got it worse . I report to you . [ All chuckling ] How could that be ? I scored higher . Yeah , in , like , one category . Come on , Marcie . We 'll have fun . Yeah , we 've been a team since Quantico . Booze and bullets . - Yeah , well , what am I , the mascot ? - No , you 're like our captain . [ Janis ] Yeah , you 'll probably outpace all of us . I 'm sure of it . Yeah , we 're sure . [ Camera beeping ] [ Mark ] Interview of Marcie Turoff , Agents Benford and Noh questioning . March 12 , 2010 . First thing we 'd like to know is ... Who came after us in that parking garage in DC ? - I don 't know . - Who came after us - in the parking garage in DC ? - I don 't know . - On to the next . - Are they still after us ? - I don 't know . - Demetri . - Who killed lan McKinnon ? - Come on . Let 's go . - Is that who 's coming after me ? - [ Mark ] Let 's go . We need those answers . Yeah , but there are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first . Listen , Dem . You think I don 't have March 15th circled in my calendar , too ? We both know there 's a chance you 'll die in three days . Look , you keep chasing down leads . I 'll let you know when we 're ready for your questions , all right ? Hey , Janis , I need your help in here with Marcie . Me ? You got something more important than grilling our mole ? No . Of course not . What were your duties ? Every week , I 'd take whatever information there was in the Mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop . Who recruited you ? I was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit . - What was his name ? - All in due time . He asked if I wanted to be a part of something big . And you said yes . You think I sold out my friends and my country , but you don 't know me . Why don 't you enlighten us ? Come on . Don 't you remember my flash forward ? No , you don 't , ' cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what I saw . I was incarcerated . That didn 't cross your mind when you shot six of your fellow agents ? It did . But even though I was in jail , I was happier than I 've been in years . I thought we 'd have to beg for life without parole . I told you they 'd come around . Until I tell them who recruited me , I 'm indispensable . For the first time since I got here , I actually felt like I was important . [ Wedeck ] I need you , Mark . These are our guests from Washington . And while they 're grateful for all our efforts in apprehending Agent Turoff ... Oh , no . You gotta be kidding . Director Middleton feels more comfortable having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her . And where he can give the press conferences himself . Hear me out . We know her . We can read her . Just give us one more day . [ Wedeck ] I know it 's frustrating , but let 's try to get something positive done today . Like maybe get back to what caused the blackout . I 'll be out of the office for a couple of hours , so give me an update . Dyson Frost . He 's our best lead so far . Where are we ? I 've left four messages . Haven 't heard back . I 'm afraid he 's toying with us . Guy 's been wanting to talk to you for 19 years , now he 's playing hard to get ? Shel , see what you can get by tracing Frost 's phone . - Yes , sir . - Hey , I just got a call from LAPD . They got a ballistics report saying that Mark 's gun , the one that 's supposed to kill me in three days , was used in a murder last night . [ Mark ] So , what do we know from the eyewitness reports ? Fifty-five year old , in his cot , presumably asleep . At 3 : 33 am , the shooter walked up to him , and a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say , [ Demetri and man ] " I knew it would be you . I just didn 't want to believe . " The shooter must have had a silencer on your gun . He plugged him three times in the chest at close range . Do you want to put that thing away ? - [ Mark ] Sorry . - Thanks . Physical description ranging from five-foot-five white guy to a six-foot Indian . - Another dead end . - Wasn 't there something about a car ? Uh ... Somebody said they saw a 1970s blue sedan drive away . Foreign make . That 's a start . LAPD 's gonna forward the victim 's effects to us . Can 't wait to sift through that . Forget about the shooter . Who 's the one other person we know who handled that gun ? There were 40 agents in that evidence room . They were all cleared months ago . One of those agents Marcie ? [ Demetri ] Marcie ! - Stop ! Stop ! - You guys never give up . - I need to talk to her . - She 's in our custody now . You can 't take her . She 's part of our investigation . I 'm just doing my job , same as you doing yours . - Who 'd you give my gun to , Marcie ? - I don 't know . - Come on . Who has it ? - I don 't know . Come on . Don 't do this . We were friends . Look , I 'm sorry . Really , I am . All I heard is that you 're supposed to die in LA . What ? Give me more specifics . - Who does it ? When ? - It was a voice on the phone when I called to report the gun in lockup . - Who 'd you call ? - A number . It was different every time . Look , that 's all I know . There isn 't any more . You 're gonna die in three days , and there 's nothing you can do to stop it . I 'm sorry . - [ Female agent ] Come on . - [ Demetri ] Marcie , come on . Come on . Marcie ! Marcie ! Marcie ! [ Charlie ] Come on , come on ! Sweetie , what is the hurry ? We 're here . I told him we 'd be here by 2 : 00 . We 're late . - Who ? - Dylan ! - Hey , Dylan . - Nuts to you , Squirrelio ! [ Together ] Toot , toot ! - Come on , Dylan ! - OK , I 'm coming . - Did you know about this ? - Absolutely not . Charlie , who arranged this ? I did ! I got Dylan 's phone number from him when he was in the hospital . He was very insistent about this specific park , and now I know why . Do you normally come here ? Well , the house is just around the corner . Right . - [ Charlie ] This is fun . - Come on . You go first . - I can sit on a bench or something . - It 's fine . Doesn 't have to be that way . [ Charlie screaming , crying ] Charlie ? - Dylan , what happened ? - Let me see , sweetie . - We bonked heads . - Did he hit your teeth ? Let me see , baby . - OK , Charlie , let 's see . Open up . - [ Dylan ] Sorry Charlie . - I 'm bleeding . - OK . Let me see . - [ Dylan ] Is she OK ? - Open your mouth . Here we go , Charlie . I want you to do something now . Just grab my hand , and when it hurts , I want you to squeeze as hard as possible , OK ? Is that all you got ? Come on . Try a little bit harder than that . That 's good . Does this mean I can 't go to the carnival , Mommy ? No , I think you 're gonna be just fine for the carnival . I think you 're gonna be OK . Yeah , that 's good . I 'm starting to feel that a bit now . I 'm just gonna go back to the car and get a bottle of water and a towel . - OK . - You 'll be OK . Yeah . I see carnivals in your future . Come here . - I wanna go . - I know . Come here . It 's OK , sweetie . Assistant Director Wedeck ? - That 's me . - Come this way . - She 's ready for you . - Thank you . - Madame Vice President . - [ Sighing ] Good to see you , Stan . It 's been quite a while . - Please sit . - Thank you . Thanks for coming on such short notice , Stan . How is everything ? You want to tell me why the hell you dragged me out here ? It 's nice to know my new position hasn 't changed your attitude towards me . Does the name Jericho ring a bell ? They 're a private contractor operating over in Afghanistan . I 've heard of them . Agent Benford looked into them a while back . Yes ? Well , in my security briefing this morning , I learned that Jericho 's CEO just tripled the security around his Malibu compound . I think you should take a look . Wrong department . NSA is who you want to call . I don 't want them to know . I need this done off the books . The vice president doesn 't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman . In my vision , it was clear that Jericho had done some things that threatened our national security . The same vision where you saw yourself as president ? [ Clemente ] As a matter of fact , yes . And I was there because Jericho did something that triggered a political crisis . I can 't find out anything about what they 're doing . But if it 's bad enough to bring down President Segovia , it must be significant . I 've been keeping a close eye on every move they make , and something is happening right now . Are you sure you don 't know what it is ? Even if I did , Dave and I go back 25 years . Listen , these flash forwards are coming true . Segovia is going down . Do you want to be out with the old or in with the new ? [ Demetri ] Now we know your gun 's here in LA . [ Mark ] Yeah , too bad Marcie couldn 't tell us who 's using it . So I 'll run this car info , see if anything pings on a 1970s blue sedan . - We 're gonna get this guy . - Yeah . Got a sec , Mark ? Jericho . You used our database to look into them a few months ago . - Is that a problem ? - No , no . Just curious why you did . It was a favor for a friend . Wanted as much information as I could give him , - which wasn 't a lot . - A friend ? Do all your friends ask you to research third world military contractors ? He had questions about his daughter 's death . - She was serving in Afghanistan . - He thinks Jericho is involved ? The things he told me , they were in confidence . - I can respect that . - Thanks . Do you mind if I talk with him ? Maybe ask him a few questions ? - What 's his name ? - Aaron Stark . Good luck finding him . He 's off the grid . I don 't even know where he is , or how to track him down . - Thank you , Mark . - Sure . Hey . Just heard on the scanner . LAPD 's in the middle of a high-speed chase . Driver , Ross Webber , has been spotted with a gun . Car they 're following , '71 blue sedan . - The shooter from the homeless shelter ? - How many criminals are driving - the same disco era sedans , right ? - Any idea where they 're headed ? [ Mark ] There 's your blue sedan . - Where is he ? - Right inside . A bunch of people ran out . He 's got hostages . - Where in the building is he ? - Second floor . - Who 's talking to him ? - No one yet . Think he 's gonna come out on his own ? Captain doesn 't want us to do anything till he gets here . - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Man ] Shots fired ! - [ Man 2 ] Get down ! Stay down ! [ Indistinct yelling ] You hang back . I talk to him , try to make sure he releases the hostage . - Once he does , you take your shot . - Sounds good , except for the part about me staying on the sidelines . No way you 're going down there . Listen , I 'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person . March 15th . I know that 's the day you 're supposed to die . Who says you didn 't get shot three days earlier ? - [ Ross ] Who the hell is that ? ! - [ Woman whimpering ] I 'm right here ! Try not to shoot me . - Stop . - Oh . I told them the only person I want to talk to is Randy Savage ! Macho Man ? Yeah , I dig that . Uh , that 's not me . My name 's Demetri . - [ Man cocks gun ] - Oh , God ! You don 't turn around in four seconds , I will kill her , Demetri . Doesn 't matter to me . She 's just a saleswoman . That 's what she gets for causing the blackout . I said stop ! OK . Ross , you saw that gun , right ? I 'm gonna take the clip off now . Here we go . Gone , buddy . - And ... - [ whimpering ] On my ankle , I got a gun , man . I 'm gonna take that off , too , OK ? - We 're not worrying about that anymore . - [ Sobbing ] Hey , what were you saying , though , about about how salespeople caused the blackout ? That 's ... that 's a fascinating theory . I 'd like to hear more about it . - They made us buy cell phones . - Uh-huh . See , before everybody had a cell phone , nobody ever blacked out . None of this ever ... Stop moving ! - OK . - You think I won 't kill you ? [ Ross ] You 're about just plain incorrect . [ Floor creaking ] I 'm not afraid . - [ Woman sobbing ] - It 's OK . Everybody 's scared of dying , man . She is . Look at her . I 'm scared of dying . All three of us . It 's what makes us human , don 't you think ? You 're scared . That 's fine . See , when people get scared , judgment gets clouded . I 'll be honest , man . You have made some really bad decisions today . But you can make a really good one right now if you just give me the gun . Ross . Come on . Let me save your life . [ Screaming ] [ Woman sobbing , screaming ] EMT says he 's stable . We can question him in the hospital . It 's not your gun . Serial number is totally different . Your gun 's still out there . So you almost got yourself killed for nothing ? - Yeah , I guess so . - [ Exhaling ] All right . You took him down , saved an innocent woman . That 's fantastic work . What I can 't understand is , if you thought that gun was gonna kill you , I mean , cops had the place surrounded . He was never gonna make it out of here anyway . That 's why I needed to get to him , man . So I could ask him why . [ Sighing ] Do you remember that speech you gave my first day on the job ? It was all about being the kind of person who could be counted on to do the right thing at the right time . And , man , since October 6th , when I didn 't see anything , I have had a lot of trouble being that person . And I need your help . Why ? [ Chuckling ] I mean , look at me . If you think I 've been making good choices lately , you 're crazier than I thought . I 'll do anything to help you , Demetri , so I 'm gonna tell you something and I really want you to listen . Get out of here . You and Zoey just get out of here . - I 'm not running away . - That 's right . You 're not . You 're being smart . Just promise me you 'll go somewhere safe . [ Horns honking ] Special Agent Noh , do you recognize exhibit H ? Yes . It 's a copy of my notes taken while witnessing the transaction . And those handwritten notes are your only record of the events ? Well , it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange . Hm . Wow ... That is very good . Agent Noh , who taught you to draw ? I guess I 'm just naturally artistic . Wow . Lucky guy , right ? Now , your description here of the alleged buyer ... Here , further down in your notes . Can you read that for the court , please ? " Caucasian male , average height / weight , dark jacket , baseball cap . " Hm . When my client was booked , he was photographed wearing a red jacket , - not a dark one , wasn 't he ? - Yes . And he clearly has a goatee , does he not , Agent Noh ? - Yes . - So which individual bought the stolen computer disk , Agent Noh ? The one with the goatee , or the one in your artistic notes ? Because they 're obviously not the same person . - Objection . Argumentative . - Sustained . - Do I get to answer that ? - Not really . No further questions . I 'm done with this witness . You can go now . Come on . There 's no need to take it personally . That was a win that you just turned into a loss . It was never really a win , because you were wrong . Wow . You know what ? I 'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs . You know what ? Look , I 'm sorry . I will turn the defense attorney off . OK , that would be an instant improvement . Why don 't you let me make it up to you ? Can I ... take you to dinner ? [ Scoffing ] - You gotta be kidding me . - What ? There 's not a chance in hell I would ever go out with you . - Hey . - Hey . - How are you ? - Good . Sit down . I want to talk to you . It 's OK . - Wow . You 're beautiful . - Shut up . - [ Laughing ] What is wrong with you ? - Nothing . It 's good . You know , I wasn 't supposed to be there that day . What day ? Al Gough was supposed to be Mark 's partner . I switched with him , and because I was Mark 's partner , I was covering the bust that led me to you . All these tiny little decisions we make without thinking , they all ... they all line up to lead us somewhere ... - Somewhere good . - Yeah . So I want to ask you if you will marry me . Baby , we covered this . I said yeah . - No , I want to get married right now . - OK . I want to get married tomorrow . Then we get on a plane and we go to Hawaii . We stay there through the 15th , maybe through April 29th . Listen , maybe we don 't ever come home . - Want to do it ? - Are you serious ? - I 'm serious . - Hell , yes ! - Yes ? - [ Laughing ] Of course ! Oh , I love you . [ Dogs barking ] [ Light knocking ] - Hey . - Hi . [ Water running ] I ... Sorry . I just wanted to come by and say thanks for what you did with Charlie today in the park . OK ... No problem . - Well , thank you . - Can I ... can I get you to come in ? I just left the water running , but please , please come in . Sure . I 'm sorry . The dishes were getting kind of out of control . Can I get you something to drink ? I could offer you a carton of milk that expired yesterday , some juice boxes or a bottle of gin . No . No , I think I ... I think I should be going . - Really ? - Yeah . Thank you for today . Yeah , I do have a telephone . You could 've called to say thank you . Olivia why are you here ? [ Olivia ] I don 't know . I 've just made such a mess of things . I wish I could blame it all on Mark , but I really can 't . I made a ton of mistakes . I know that feeling . I tried my best with Linda after Dylan was born , but ... To be honest , I used his autism as an excuse to get away from her . Even the thought of that makes me ashamed now . I thought I was doing the right thing at the time . You 're damned if you do , and then you 're damned if you don 't . Yeah , maybe we just choose to live in the moment , you know , just grab the good things in our life when we recognize them . - I have to go . - Look . Wait . I 'm not trying to argue against Mark . He 's a brave man doing something extraordinary . Yeah , he is . This does kind of put me in the Lancelot-trying-to - persuade-Guinevere position . Oh , you did not just compare yourself to Lancelot . Yeah , well , the only other metaphor I had involved protons and neutrons , and believe me , under the circumstances , - I went with the stronger choice . - [ Both chuckling ] I know that we 're feeling the same thing right now . How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I 'm in that room on April the 29th . That wasn 't an accident . This scares me . It should . Who the hell are you ? It 's OK , Aaron . I work with Mark . I 'm a friend . You mind telling me how you found me ? There was a computer in Echo Park doing web searches for a " Jericho Parwan Afghanistan , " " Jericho central base " - and " Jericho murder US soldiers . " - That library 's two miles from here . And this is the 14th cash-only hotel I 've hit . Well , here I am . Now what ? Mark didn 't want to tell me why you were so interested in Jericho . But some very powerful people would love to take them down . All they need is proof . They got my daughter . - They kill her ? - They tried . She 's still alive . - But in your file it ... - Tracy 's alive . She was here , but Jericho found her and took her back to Afghanistan . I gotta believe I 've only got so much time left to find her . Wait . You 're going to Afghanistan ? - Sure am . - I know you were in the service and everything , but how are you planning on getting there ? Fly into Uzbekistan , cross the border at Termez . And you 're doing this with a U.S. Passport ? - Yeah . - You 'll be dead - before you leave Hairaton . - I don 't have a choice . Do you know why Jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago ? She saw Jericho wipe out an entire village . If I could help you get to Tracy do you think she would tell us the whole story ? [ Janis ] Really ? You can do that legally ? - Hey , Demetri . Come here . - What ? - Come here . - Yo , I 'm getting married . - Come here . - I 'm getting married . So would you be OK with Vreede officiating at your wedding ? - Define " OK . " - No charge . [ Sighing ] - Consider it my wedding gift . - You 're gonna marry him ? [ Janis ] Vreede 's an Internet minister . Have I ever told you how awesome you are , Shelly Vreede ? - You make me feel awesome . - Janis , you 're awesome , too . - Oh , thank you . - Janis is awesome . That 's very sweet . Thank you . - All right . - Mark is awesome . - Time to take the groom home . - Yeah . Let 's find a cab . - Here we go , buddy . - All right . - OK , I 'm sleepy . - [ Janis ] Yeah . Good night . You got military clearance . Your cover is you 're in Afghanistan to help install their power grid . Satellite phone . Video capability . As soon as you can document what Tracy knows , I want it uploaded . If you see any Jericho activity , I want it uploaded . Pictures , video , audio , anything you can get me . - No problem . - Get yourself to Bagram as soon as you 're clear . Military transports leave every two days . - I 'll arrange a flight home . - Excellent . I 'm guessing you don 't need me to tell you what to do with these . I got a couple ideas . [ Grunting ] All this gear is clean . None of it can be traced back to this agency . If they find you you 're on your own . - Is that it ? - I guess it is . - Thank you , Stan . This isn 't something I think I need to tell you , but there 's a very good chance you 're never coming back . I saw myself with my daughter . We were together in Afghanistan , and she was alive . God help anyone who stands in my way . Do you think I 'm a chicken for running away ? Sometimes the best offense is a good defense . No , Janis , I 'm just scared . You played this out as best as you could . Everybody needs a successful exit strategy . This is yours . [ Sighing ] Hey , um ... [ laughing ] I want you to know that night in Somalia ... - Demetri , don 't . - No , I want to . I have to ... - Stop . - Just stop . - No ... This may be my last chance , all right ? I 'm pregnant . - What ? - [ Engine starts ] Janis . Janis ! Oh , my gosh . This is perfect . My mom is gonna be so excited . Well , I 'm happy to let you use the space , but since you aren 't members here , and since we didn 't do any premarital counseling ... We don 't need premarital counseling . We 've been living together for a year . I 'm going to pretend I didn 't hear that . Listen , you need to get married this afternoon , fine . But under these circumstances , you 're going to need to find somebody else to officiate for you . Hey , I never heard . Did you track down Aaron ? I guess he didn 't want to be found . Guys , you gotta see this . It 's Frost . - You found him ? - His phone was activated 12 days ago at a convenience store on the corner of Western and Washington , 3 : 18 pm . 3 : 19 , a man fitting Frost 's description walks to a 1971 Citroën DS sedan , powder blue , silver top . - A match from the shelter . - Wait a minute . Dyson Frost made a videotape for you 19 years ago , then encoded a phone number for you to find . And then after all that , instead of meeting with you , he 's murdering a homeless guy ? But he used my gun to do it . He may be crazy , but he isn 't random . There 's a method here . [ Mark ] We just don 't understand what it is yet . [ Singing to himself ] Any word from the LAPD on the search for Frost 's vehicle ? - Still looking . I 'll stay on top of it . - Let 's keep putting the pressure on . Guys , can we stop with the shoptalk ? This is a special occasion . It 's just like Demetri to be late for his own wedding . He 's not answering his cell . I called three times . - Let me try . - [ Buttons beeping ] [ Ringing ] [ Demetri ] Demetri Noh . Leave a message . - Nothing . - What is it ? Guys , where is he ? [ Woman over PA ] ... ticket booth is right by the entrance . Buy a whole bunch of tickets , get ... Don 't forget to buy your raffle tickets ... All proceeds go to the book fund . - [ Man ] Corn dogs ! - [ Charlie ] Let 's get some cotton candy ! - Hey , sweetie . - Hi , Mom ! Hey , step right up , ladies and gents . Wheel of fortune . One spin for three tickets . You want to give me ? Round and round she goes , - and where she stops , nobody knows . - [ Phone ringing ] Uh ... - Hey . - Hey . Where are you ? Uh , school carnival . Well , listen , I 'm calling because I 'm not gonna make it . - I need you to keep Charlie . - Oh . How come ? - Something 's happened to Demetri . - What ? Not sure what it is yet . He didn 't show up at the wedding . I just thought you should know . Wow . What do you think happened ? [ Mark ] I don 't know . I hope it 's just cold feet , because it 's almost March 15th , and this is too close for comfort . - Olivia ? - Yeah ? - Be careful . - Of course . - Kiss Charlie for me . - I will . Hang on , kids . Charlie ! Charlie ! Hello , Charlie .

 [ Colonel Everett Young ] : That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . Are we done ? We 'll never be done . [ punching , grunting ] [ Camile Wray ] : You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . [ Young ] : You think I don 't know that ? [ Chloe Armstrong ] : Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? [ snarls and vocalizes ] [ Chloe ] : We 're not safe , are we ? - They 're coming ! - Who 's coming ? Lucian alliance . They 're coming to take Destiny . [ Rush ] : There 's only one way this is going to end If we wait . [ Young ] : I 'm not surrendering this ship . We need to kill them all . Everyone except the doctors . And Lieutenant Johansen . [ Lt. Tamara Johansen ] : Remember that planet we stopped at ? They have my baby . [ Colonel David Telford ] : You have no idea what it 's like To remember things you 've done that ... You weren 't yourself . Riley is not going to make it , sir . [ Gloria Rush ] : You found the keys to controlling all of Destiny 's systems . And you 're not going to tell anyone , are you ? There 's an object out there . What is it ? We 're not sure , but we 're about to find out . We 're headed straight for it . Do we know what it is ? Not yet . Brody . Colonel . Ready weapons . I don 't think that 'll be necessary . It 's a ship . It looks like Destiny . It 's got to be of ancient design . Colonel , this is Brody . Go ahead . We 're not slowing down . We 're on a collision course . Ready main weapon . We 're going to hit it . No , no , we 're not going to hit it . We 're going to dock with it . You got any more predictions ? [ Rush ] : Yeah . I suspect that , very shortly , You 'll be assembling a team to send over there . How did you know we were going to dock ? Call it a hunch . Given the second ship 's similarity in design , our calculated approach , well , I thought it was rather obvious , really . So , what 's happening here ? Destiny is exchanging data with the seed ship . [ Brody ] : One of many Traveling well ahead of Destiny , Seeding planets with stargates , gathering information . This one obviously experienced some sort of system failure , Allowing us to catch up with it . What kind of data ? Difficult to say at the moment . It may take a while to translate . Well , then , yoyou 'd better get started . There 's plenty of time for that later . For now , This is a fantastic opportunity , And I want to explore it . No , I 'm sure you do , but I need y here . I need to know What kind of information we 're receiving . No countdown clock . Yeah , I figure Destiny 's going to give us as long as it takes . And how long is that ? Given the amount of data and the rate of transfer , I 'd guess at least two hours . Okay . Brody , Volker , you are on the away team . You have two hours . Make it quick . [ Rush scoffs ] : With all due respect To Brody and Volker ... They 'll be fine . Call it a hunch . Camile . I thought you were being debriefed . Homeworld command can wait . What 's going on with this seed ship ? Some sort of data transfer 's been initiated . In the meantime , Colonel Young is sending a team over to investigate . David ... [ Scott ] : All right , Colonel , we are good to go . Stand by . [ beeping , door unlocking ] Heading in . Okay , we are at the airlock . [ Eli ] : Life support is active over there , So you have a go . Right . That ship 's older than Destiny And could be in pretty bad shape . Proceed with caution , Lieutenant . Yes , sir . [ Eli ] : It 's incredible . Okay , maybe not as incredible As checking out a seed ship , But , still , pretty damned incredible . There 's no telling What kind of information we 're getting here . It could be anything , From ancient history To details of the Destiny 's mission ... Where are you going ? The bathroom . Is that all right ? Hey . T.J. There you are . Oh ... Oh , God , I was supposed to meet you in the infirmary , wasn 't I ? About 20 minutes ago . Sorry . Are you ... Okay ? Yeah . You sure ? After everything that 's happened to you ... Let 's not do this here , okay ? Okay , but ... Look , you really should talk to someone . And I 'm not saying that it has to be me . If there 's someone else You 'd feel more comfortable confiding in ... It 's not that . Then why aren 't you ... Because there 's nothing to talk about , chlwe . Look , I lost my baby . And now maybe she 's in a better place . And maybe it 's for the best . You can 't mean that . Let 's go to the infirmary And I 'll take a look at your leg wound . There is no leg wound . That 's what I was coming by to tell you . It 's almost completely healed . How is that possible ? I don 't know . We 'd cover a lot more ground if we split up . You heard the Colonel . Proceed with caution . We are not splitting up . Fine . Then let 's at least turn the kino on search mode . Yeah , knock yourself out . [ device beeping ] [ Gloria ] : A fascinating bit of information . Of course you know what this means . We may have a way of getting home . But you 're not going to tell them that , are you ? Well , I 'm sure they 'll figure it out On their own . And if they don 't ? Well ... Well , well , well ... What do we have here ? Ship 's control center , I 'm guessing . And I was gonna go with rec room . [ computer system booting up ] Hey , what did the Colonel say ? He said , " you 've got two hours . Make it fast . " Colonel , this is Scott . Go ahead . We 've found what appears to be the ship 's control center . Brody and Volker Are bringing systems online for study . Keep me updated . Where the hell were you ? I stopped by the mess . I tried radioing you . Yeah , I know . Everett , can I talk to you for a second ? Sure . You sent a team over ? Yeah . Without bothering to run it by me ? Last time I checked , I was the commanding officer of this ship . I 'm not disputing that ... Meaning I don 't have to run anything by you Or anyone else , for that matter . I don 't have a problem with sending a team over . I 'd just appreciate being kept in the loop . Let me help . I don 't need your help . Like hell you don 't . David ... Dammit , Everett ... You 've been going this alone since the incursion , And it 's been taking a toll . When are you going to realize That this isn 't just about you ? You have a responsibility To the people on board this ship And , lately , You haven 't been up to the task . Now , you either shape up or step back . You 're tired . I get it . Let me help . Oh , you 're a persistent son of a bitch . Hey , you saved my life . I had to kill you to do it . And I 'm willing to do the same for you . Okay . They 've found what looks to be The ship 's control center And they 're bringing systems online . What 's the game plan ? The game plan is Just get as much information we can before our time runs out . [ systems powering up ] Colonel , I hear we 've docked with a seed ship . That 's right . I 'd like to offer my help . I have some understanding of ancient technology ... No , thank you . But I can be of some assistance ... I said no . I 'm not letting you or your people anywhere near that ship . You wanted to see me ? I want to know How long you plan on keeping us locked up . I didn 't really have a plan . I just thought I 'd play it by ear , see how things go . We 've been cooperative with your homeworld command , providing them with information on the alliance As requested . You had no choice . It was either that Or get left behind On some God-forsaken planet . We took down dannic And gave you back control of this ship . To save your own lives . Ours weren 't the only ones at risk And , if you remember , I stepped in And prevented the execution Of all military personnel aboard Destiny , including you . I think we were better use to you alive . But for what it 's worth , I thank you . [ slams table ] We can 't spend The rest of our days here on this ship As prisoners . Should 've thought about that before you attacked us . The way I see it , It could 've gotten a hell of a lot worse For you . Colonel , just tell me , What do we have to do to earn our freedom ? Prove to me that you 're not a threat . And how do we do that ? I don 't think you can . [ Varro , angrily ] : I 'm not your enemy anymore . Neither are my people ! I think you know that . [ doors open , close ] Told you . Okay , so ... Making any progress ? Sure . All right , Then maybe sgt . Greer and I will take a little look around . Knock yourselves out . Hey , am I reading this right ? If you have to ask , my guess would be no . Seriously . Check out these power readings . Oh , my God ! Dr. Rush , you 'd better check this out . It was you , wasn 't it ? You 're the one Who told the prisoners about the seed ship ? [ sighs ] : Any major developments aboard Destiny Concern them as well . They had a right to know . Oh , dammit , Camile , they 're prisoners . They don 't have any rights . Oh , I can 't believe what I 'm hearing . They attacked the ship , they threatened us . And now we have to live with them . No , we don 't . We already got rid of most of them . There 's only a handful left . Homeworld command needs the intel they 're providing and , in exchange for that information , they made a deal . That homeworld command doesn 't have to live with , but we do . Then all the more reason We should be showing these people Some respect . You know , if you would just take the time To get to know them , You 'd realize many of them didn 't have a choice But to join the alliance . You know what , I don 't ... I don 't care . And I 'm going to be damned , if I risk the health and welfare of people aboard this ship on marching orders from the other side of the Universe . And what about the people back home ? Are you willing to risk their lives instead ? Because that 's what 's going to happen If you renege on this deal . Homeworld command has received confirmation That the Lucian alliance is planning an attack on Earth , and it 's quite possible that these prisoners have information that could help head off that attack . Or they could be lying . Yes , sure , they could be , But are you really willing to take that chance ? Look , I understand . These last few days have been hard on you . Camile , do me a favor . Just watch what you say to the prisoners . We 're planning a service For Sergeant riley Later this week . I thought Maybe you 'd want to say a few words . Of course . So come on . Chen ? Ramirez ? That redheaded civilian contractor With the ... Park . Park ? Yeah . Remember that hamstring injury I said I got Doing squats ? Yeah . It wasn 't doing squats . You wanted to see me ? We checked , we re-checked , And re-re-checked just to be sure ... The seed ship has sizable energy reserves . How sizable ? With the output of both capacitors in play , Enough to power the gate And get us home . In order for that to happen , I have to alter certain conduits To open up a transfer channel , But that 's not something I can do From here . Go . [ static crackles ] - What was that ? - What ? We just lost the kino feed . Ready , Eli . [ Rush ] : Eli ? Yeah . Right . Right . [ beeping ] [ door beeps ] Dr. Rush , perfect timing . You 're going to want to see this . Okay , back in a flash . Wait . No ... where are you going ? There 's a malfunctioning relay station one floor up . I 'll see if I can fix it , Bring up that dead console . [ Rush ] : I 'll warn you , Lieutenant , I tend to find surprises Particularly underwhelming . Not this one , you won 't . Trust me . Pretty darn cool , huh ? Yes . Of course . This is where the stargates were manufactured Before being transported to the various planets . Okay . Is that it ? Yeah . That 's it . Well , now we 're done With this little diversion , Could you escort me to the control room ? [ laughing in disbelief ] Didn 't take you long , but there 's still more that ... Oh , my God ! I don 't ... I don 't ... Please ... What the hell ? If you 're not careful , that cut 's going to open back up again . I can 't help it . I like to play rough . How about you ? [ grunts in pain ] I got it . Yeah , I do . [ winces ] Do you think you could handle me ? [ gulps ] [ applies pressure ] [ quiet grunt ] No . I didn 't think so . [ lets out a breath ] Lieutenant Scott , this is Volker . Go ahead . You might want To come back to the control room . You find something interesting ? Well , yeah , actually . Something interesting found me . Have a seat . I 'd like to take a look at your wound . Looks like it 's healing nicely . Too bad . I was kind of hoping for a manly scar . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry your child couldn 't be saved . It 's difficult to lose someone you love . I know . My wife , anthea , three years ago . She was on her way back from the market When she was caught in a rainstorm . She ended up taking refuge in a shelter . It collapsed , killing her and six others . I 'm sorry . She never liked me being in the alliance . She thought it was too dangerous . I risked my life Time and again , Survived missions that should have killed me , And yet ... She dies doing something as mundane As getting caught in the rain . You felt guilty . Guilty . Angry . Despondent . I ... I was miserable Until I came to an understanding . And what was that ? That life is loss . [ Young , over radio ] : T.J. ? Sir ? Grab your med kit and meet me at the airlock . You 're heading over to the seed ship . Is anyone hurt ? Not exactly . According to Scott , The alien is alive but unresponsive . How 'd it even get on the ship ? No idea . Okay . I 'll do my best . You sure you don 't want me To use the stones , Bring someone else in ? No . Sir , I want to do this . All right . I 'm going with . The Lieutenant already has an escort . I 'm tired of sitting on the sidelines . Put me in , coach . Okay . Eli . [ door beeps ] Good luck . T.J. I got it . [ airlock closes ] Hey . You sure it 's alive ? It 's breathing . [ Greer ] : At least that 's What we think it 's doing . [ shrieks ] Lieutenant ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . [ speaking alien language ] Little help here , Rush ? Me ? You 're the only one With any experience communicating with aliens . Different aliens . However , I think A good first step Might be to lower your weapons . Scott . Scott . You ? Understand ? No ? No . Does anybody have any food ? Anybody ? Yeah ... no , I 've got a piece of dried fruit That I was saving for later . Are you kidding ? That stuff 's horrible . It tastes like rambutan . Tastes like crap . What 's rambutan ? It 's sort of like a longan . Longan ? Just give it here . Mm . Good . [ chews ] [ spits ] What 'd I say ? You know , it may be wise To find out whether or not it came alone . He 's right . We should run a sweep . You two keep our guest company . Each of you take a corridor . Radio check-in , 10 minutes . Eli , this is Dr. Rush . Come in . Go ahead . I 'm initiating the transfer . I need you to isolate the power and direct it towards the gate . [ keys clacking , beeping ] It 's working . Power from both ships Is being transferred directly to the gate . [ Greer , over radio ] : Colonel , Lieutenant . Go ahead , master Sergeant . Yeah , it seems that the alien is not alone . It 's got friends ... And plenty of ' em . [ Wray ] : Very shortly , we will be making an attempt to dial Earth . If a successful connection is made , we will need to move quickly . All crew members are to proceed to the gate room immediately . Come again ? [ Telford ] : Greer has discovered Several more pods , all empty , Suggesting there are more of these things on board . Well , how many more ? About a dozen . Rush figures they were a research team Who were dropped off To do a long-term study of the ship . Well , let 's get our people out of there Before their ride comes back to pick them up . Making our way to the control room . I want Rush and the science team Back on the Destiny now . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . I can 't leave just yet . What is it now , Rush ? I should stay here In case there 's any interruption To the power transfer . We may only have one shot at this . Well , what 's the situation with the alien ? Docile . Not a threat . You can 't know that for sure . Colonel , there 's really no point in arguing about this . I have to stay here to make sure this works . All right , fine . I 'll send reinforcements . I would advise against that . I 'm sending them anyway . Okay , I 'll head back Once a stable wormhole has been established . All right . Airman dunning , you 're with Rush . Everyone else , fall back . Go . Bring the alien . Power buffers are at optimum . We 're good to go . [ low chatter ] Commencing dialing sequence . People , homeworld command is expecting us . Here we go . [ chevrons dialing ] Bring the prisoners . It 's working . [ Eli ] : The gate 's dialing . Let me know When you secure the connection . We 're going home . [ dialing ceases ] - What happened ? - I don 't know . Eli ? Eli ? The power transfer 's been interrupted . Hang on . [ murmurs of consternation ] Rush ? Rush , what 's happening ? I 'm not sure , but it appears That tapping this ship 's energy reserves Seems more problematical than we thought . [ electricity surges ] [ electricity crackles , ship groans ] Eli , what the hell was that ? We 've got a problem . The energy transfer 's been reversed ! Dr. Rush , did you hear that ? The seed ship has begun drawing power away from Destiny . Dr. Rush ? [ computers beeping ] Colonel Young , We just lost contact with Rush . Dunning . Dunning , are you there ? David , I need you to go to the control room and find out why Rush isn 't responding . We 're already on our way . T.J. , Marsden , and the science team are headed back to Destiny with the alien . Have you found any more ? Not yet . [ Young ] : Talk to me , Eli . The seed ship is still drawing power away from Destiny . When the reserves are gone , there 's no getting them back . Pretty soon , we won 't even be able to make an FTL jump . So we can 't stop it ? We 're trying , but nothing 's working . What if we disconnect from the seed ship ? Yeah , that would sever the power flow . Unfortunately , we have no idea how to do that . We 've got to learn . We 've got to learn fast . [ gunshots ricochet ] Colonel , this is T.J. We lost the alien . Copy that . Check them . He 's still breathing . [ Young ] : David . We 've found Rush and dunning . They 're unconscious . [ Young ] : It doesn 't look like we 'll be able To stop the power transfer , So our only option Is to sever the link between the two ships . We need you back here in order to disconnect . Negative . This is our one shot at getting home . There 's got to be a way to reverse the transfer . Eli 's tried and come up short . Listen , David , I want nothing more than to get everyone back home , But I 'm not willing to risk anyone 's life To do it . Put Eli on . Come on . Colonel ? Is there a way to reverse the transfer From my end ? Eli ? ! Theoretically , yeah . Yeah , it 's possible . Tell me what to do . You need to find anything that resembles a schematic Or ... or an active display , Possibly indicative of the power transfer . Greer , Scott , get those two back to safety . Sir , those aliens are probably responsible For what 's happened . If they come back here , you will ... Go . Go . [ beeping ] All right , I got it . [ Eli ] : Okay , now , I 'm going to walk you through this ... Forget walking . Let 's sprint . I 've got a basic knowledge of ancient systems . You need to access the ship 's distribution network . How are we doing for time ? [ Park ] : Once we hit red , we 're at the point of no return . We have less than 15 minutes . [ door slams loudly ] [ presses button ] We 're locked out . Wake up ! [ door slams ] What the hell ... ? Forget it . Keep moving ! [ grunting with effort ] [ computer beeps ] Eli , I 'm done . What 's next ? Now you need to open a secondary conduit . It 's not budging . [ airlock releases ] [ latch opens ] It 's no use . We are cut off from the control room . Fall back . All right , you guys heard the man . Let 's fall back . [ Park ] : Less than six minutes . Are we any closer to finding a way To disconnect from the seed ship ? We need Rush . Eli . Lieutenant Scott . Come in ! We need Rush in the control room now . Dr. Rush ? He is gone , sir . He 's gone where ? I don 't know . Find him . Look , There 's no way we 're going to figure out How to disconnect in time . It 's all up to Colonel Telford . Less than four minutes . David , how 's it coming ? Almost there . Okay . Next ? Okay , now , all you have to do E the power relay okay . Next ? And just re-route it back Through the channel you 've just created . Three minutes . Almost there . [ rumbling , crackling ] [ energy surging , ship groaning ] What was that ? [ Young ] : No idea . Eli ? We just disconnected from the seed ship . Wait a minute . I thought you said ... I didn 't . It wasn 't me . Well , then , how ? How ? I had no choice . In order to save the crew ? Or did you do it to save your dream ? Which was it , nicholas ? David , We just disconnected from the seed ship And we 're about to jump into FTL . I 'm sorry . Can 't blame me for trying , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Take care of those people . And Everett ... Take care of yourself . Everett ? Destiny , are you there ? [ static crackles ] [ shuts off radio ] [ quiet footsteps approaching ] [ door opens ] I understand that you made saving me a priority after I was shot . You didn 't have to . Of course I did . Anyways , thank you .

 Subtitles by King I hope you enjoy it , Tom . We 'd like to welcome you aboard this evening . We 're showing clear skies and good visibility up ahead . So we hope you 'll sit back , relax , and enjoy the flight . What the ... Tower , do you copy ? Tower , east-bound jet coming in hot . We just had a near miss up here ! Do you copy ? Roger . It was the Stark Industry 's corporate jet ... with the CEO onboard . Seems he 's a little ahead of his flight plan . Tony Stark ? That was Iron Man . It all begins here , the Land of the Rising Son . Dr. Tanaka ? I 'm sorry . I just didn 't expect the head of Lab 23 ... and my right-hand man in Japan to be a woman , - and pretty one at that . - Allow me to say , sir . It 's an honour to be working with a man ... behind Iron Man . So , where to first ? You have a meeting with the Minister of Defense at 8 : 00 . Meeting ? Come on , let 's do something fun , I just got here . I was thinking maybe we can grab a bite to eat if you 're hungry . Perhaps you have heard the expression , " Time is money " . Hm , no , never . I can see you 've got a lot to teach me , Dr. You know , I don 't get turned down a lot . I kind of like it .. Good evening , Mr. Stark , Welcome to Japan . I appreciate you taking the time to greet me personally , thank you . So , that 's the Arc Station below ? Right next to the US military base . By the way , I 'm sorry for all of this . I truly wish I had the time to give you a proper tour Kyoto . No at all , you couldn 't ask for a more incredible view . It 's inspiring to see our two countries united . Working together toward a common goal . Very much so . I wanna tell you how grateful for the opportunity ... to build an arc station in Japan . I honestly believe ... this could be the first step toward world peace . I hope so . But tell me , Mr. Stark ... Is there any truth to the rumors you 're retiring Iron Man ? There is , but I wouldn 't worry too much , minister . Dio , my new Iron Man prototype ... is ready for mass production . Mass production ? - Hm , that 's very impressive . - Impressive indeed . The training of my replacement has already begun . I see , but you yourself are relinquishing the role ? I 've hung up my armor ... In fact , I 've put it on display at my home . It 's just a museum piece now . Remarkable , to willingly give up such power . Ah well , meanwhile , let 's get down to business . We have an arc station ... to get up and running , Minister Kuroda . We can 't keep the world waiting . What exactly is the reactor 's status , Dr. Tanaka ? As of this morning , we 're at 90 % completion . Extraordinary . I knew you people at Lab 23 were good . But I didn 't know they were this good . Of course , ultimately we won 't be able to proceed ... without the plutonium priming device . Oh , I wouldn 't worry about that . But I do , Mr. Stark . I think we have to be concerned about what the Japanese public 's reaction will be to all this .. Yes , it 's pretty grime picture , all right . Unlimited free energy forever . I mean , that 'd be terrible , who in their right mind would want that ? I 'm afraid some people might not be able to view it the way you do . If you hope to succeed here , Mr. Stark ... Perhaps you should understand the Japanese way of thinking . Okay then , why don 't you educate me ? What 've I got to do to make the Japanese fall in love with me ? You might try , a modicum of humility . Humility . Hm , that 's a tough one ; I 'm not even sure what it means . Your mind is miles away , Tony . I don 't thinkg I 've ever seen you so Zen-like . Ah , it 's nothing , I 'm fine . It 's just been a long day , Pepper . Anyway , what 's the news ? The Iron Man Dio prototype is completed ... and the first batch of trainees are on their way to Japan . Excellent . How 's life in the Land of the Rising Sun ? Oh , you known , good food , beautiful women . What 's not to like ? But the best of all , Pepper ... the Japanese really seem to be onboard with the Arc Station . This is the perfect place to launch my initiative . Great , sounds like it 's all coming together . Couldn 't be better . You know , we were right to start this project in Japan . Right here , Pepper , this is it . This is where my dream finally comes true . I just hope that they appreciate what you 're trying to do over there . Nanami , what is this drivel ? Over-written , sentimental ! You call this a news story ? Well , I call it trash ! What do you really think ? I 'm starting to think your skills might be better applied to another line of work . - Like finding a husband . - I volunteer , totally ! - You stay out of this ! - You guys ... are so enlightened and sensitive . You wanna see reporting , Look at this ! What ? Tony Stark is here ? It 's called news ! And I 'm tired of the competition getting to it first ! You understand ? So get out of there and get on that story ! Some things are worth waiting for . Gentlemen , I give you , Iron Man Dio . Mass production can begin ... as soon as we get past inspection , sir . Well , that 's fine . But the most high-tech hardware is only as good as the man behind it . - You guys are where I came to see . - Thank you , Mr. Stark , sir . It 's an honour to be chosen for this project . - You can count on us , sir . - Well , that 's good news . All right , who 's the lucky lady who gets the first dance ? I 'll be piloting , unless of course you ride . No , no . This is your show . I 'll be up in the cheap seats . Hard to believe all this came out of that guy 's brain . Man 's a genius . Well , he 's smart enough to know when to step aside and let the next generation take over . You got that right . - Where was the impact ? - Here , sir . - That was right on target , a direct hit . - Yes , sir . And it 's still standing ? I 'm showing no damage . Extraordinary , no a scratch on it . As we say in my country , you ain 't seen nothing yet . Time for the flight test , Mr. Stark . Of course , the moment we 've all been waiting for . Let 's find out what 1.5 billion dollors can do , shall we ? We 're ready , sir . You won 't be disappointed . - Hey , it 's him . Mr. Stark ! - Mr. Stark ! Is it true that your Arc Station is just a front ... for military weapons development ? You guys make me feel right at home . Reporters in my country ask stupid questions too . Can you explain the purpose of the station ? Sure can . Okay , here 's your headline ... The Arc Station will supply unlimited energy ... that 's absolutely clean and totally free . For free ? But how is that possible ? Well , if I explain that , I 'll bore the pants off everone ... - including me . - There are not military applications ? Of course not . Listen , Stark Industry ... was involved in the defence industry in the past . But today , we 're at the forefront of the march toward global peace . And the Arc Reactor is just a start . Mr. Stark , to change the subject for a moment , tell us about Iron Man . Will you be putting on your armor and going into action ... while you 're here in Japan ? That 's a good question . No , I will not . In fact , my days as Iron Man is over . - I 'm officially retired . - Retiring ? Are you kidding ? But you can 't . Now you 'll still have an Iron Man , folks ... It just won 't be me . Nanami , go on ask him something . Yeah . Excuse me . - I 'm so sorry . - Well , hello ? If you wanted a one-on-one , all you had to do was ask . I don 't bite . You jerk ! How dare you ? Woh , Nanami . Welcome , and thank you all for coming . In collaboration with your own Self Defence force ... I 'd like to put on a small demonstration as a token of my esteem ... for your great country . So now , I 'd like you all to just sit back and relax ... Hang on to your hats and let the show begin . - Look who it is ! - Tony Stark ! - Tony . - What a show-off . Look at him , sure doesn 't look like a cheap seat to me . That was the shortest retirement in history . So much for humility . This isn 't good . Oh no ! What in world ? - What was that weird flash of light ? - Hello ? Are you all right ? I 'm all right , This is nothing . But I still got a feeling in my left cheek , thank you very much . - Yeah , sorry about that . - Mr. Stark , are you all right ? I 'm fine , Dr , The Earth broke my fall . All mechanical systems have shut down . I see . I 'll leave it here for you team to pick up . - Meet you back at the station - We 're on our way . Just wondering if I can ask you for a favour . I suppose so . Would you mind terribly giving me a ride home ? Sure , I mean no . I mean , I 'd be happy to . Oh , in return , will you give me an exclusive interview ? I 'm Nanami Ota , from the Tokyo Journal . Where to start ? Come one , Nanami , think , think ! You know , most reporters who interview me ... ask me at least one question . Tell me , so , are you retiring , or aren 't you ? Oh , that was it ... That 's the last time you 'll see me in an Iron Man armor . At least untill the next time . I think I know what your next question is . It 's what everyone wants to know sooner or later . Oh , really ? And what question is that ? Does Tony Stark close his eyes when he kisses ? I 'll get out here , before you get another swing at me . Hey , you still owe me an interview ! I thought it might be a bug in the A.I. code . But that 's not it .. What caused that flash of light I saw ? Mr. Stark , I 'm having the trainee team ... run a full diagnostic test of Dio 's armor . Thank you , doctor . Let me know the results immediately . - Okay , we 're ready . - Ready . There isn 't anything wrong with it , as far as I can see . Oh , maybe it 's just to much machine for the old man . Hey , what is it ? What 's the matter ? What you do think it 's going on ? You 're okay in there ? - He 's targeting us . - What are you doing , Stop ! Dr. Tanaka ! What 's going on ? What just happened ? I 'm not sure . All I can tell you is that the prototype ... just attacked two of the trainees . So that 's it . - We 've been compromised . - What ? Compromised ? Reprogrammed . Somebody 's hacked into the prototype 's operating system ... and taken it over . - How ? - I don 't know . I can 't figure it out , It doesn 't matter . What matters now is they 've got control of Dio . It all started with the malfunctioning ... and that strange flash of light . Mr. Stark , it appears Dio is headed outside . Don 't let it out ! Put the whole place on block-out ! Understood , right away . Close blocks 5 and 6 ! The blast doors aren 't stopping it ... It 's approaching Block 7 . Slow it down , I 'm on my way . We 'll hold it as long as can . Close all blast doors and secure the perimeter ! Well , my old friend .. It looks like you and me have one last rodeo . There you are . Playtime 's over . Not bad . But you 're just a knock-off . There 's only one Iron Man . Whoopsy , I hope I didn 't go overboard . - Hey , buddy . - Impact imminent . - Iron Man . - That 's me . - Who , you ? - I am Scorpio . A worrior of the great Zodiac . - Zo .. Zodiac ? - Yes . Now , die . - I 'm only the beginning . - All right , good looking . Time to say goodnight . What ? The Dio armor , it 's gone . Well , So much for early retirement .

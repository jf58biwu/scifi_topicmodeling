 Now that the devastating monster , Yamigedo has been revived ... The only way to seal him away again is with the power of the eight Omni Lords ! We 're going to find them , no matter what ! The Omni Lords ! Buddyfight ! When I say no , I mean no ! Right now , I won 't permit you to fight Yamigedo . B-But why , Count ? Yeah ! We finally found Ikazuchi 's lair , right , Zanya ? Yeah . There 's no mistake . It may be true that you 're able to use Dragon World decks again . But if we try to fight Yamigedo before we 've found all of the Omni Lords your Buddy and your friends , and you yourself could be in danger . Right now , we can 't make a move . I think the Count is right . You too , Kuguru ? Well , just think about it . If you fight Ikazuchi and lose Drum , you could get gobbled up by Yamigedo ! It 's no use talking to Kuguru . Baku , what do you think ? Are those the cards that came out from the Omni Lord emblem ? Drum . Sorry , but can you turn into a card for a bit ? Why now ? Hurry ! Here ya go ! Just as I thought . What is it ? These seven Fifth Omni Cavalry Dragons each have a support function for Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum . A support function for Drum ? That 's not quite right . Our function is to support Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Tenbu . We 're not supposed to babysit some wimpy little newbie ! Who are you calling a wimp ? I have a name , and it 's the son of the honorable Drum Bunker Dragon Fang Slade Terrestrial the Thirteenth ! Well , at least your name is impressive . I 've got a name too , and it 's Fire Sword , Doble . You 'd better remember it , wimp ! Come on , Doble . Pleased to meet you . I 'm Wind Bow , Meglax . Stop popping out with your giant bodies ! You should be more considerate ! - I apologize . - What a pain . In other words , you guys don 't acknowledge Drum as an Omni Lord . - Of course we don 't . - It 's all too sudden . I don 't care . You 're not the only Fifth Omni Cavalry Dragons . If there 's a total of seven of you , there must be some who 'll acknowledge me . Looks like there isn 't a single one , Drum . - See ya ! We 're leaving too . - Please , wait ! Before you go , will you let us build a deck that includes you two ? If you Fifth Omni Calvary Dragons team up with Drum I think we can make the ultimate deck . Please ! - Sniff , sniff ... - You heard him . What do you want to do , Doble ? Doble ? Big Brother Gao ! I brought some octopus dumplings ! So that 's the source of that smell ! Luminize ! Super Dragon Fifth Omni Formation ! These are delicious ! I can 't stop eating them ! - Don 't eat so fast ! - It 's exactly as she says , Doble . Shut up ! You 're chowing down just as much as I am , you sneak ! How about it ? If you help us seal Yamigedo we 'll let you eat as much as you like , every day . - E-Every day ? Are you serious ? - Yeah ! I promise ! - Then let 's go already . - G-Go where ? - It 's obvious , isn 't it ? Wherever Yamigedo is . - My , my . You sure are impatient . W-Wait ! We 're going now ? Hey , Drum ! Wait ! Please don 't try to stop us . I just can 't leave Yamigedo at large . Sorry . I understand . I 'll go too . You mustn 't , Gao ! The Count said ... ! I know . But if my partner says he 's going no matter what , I have to go too . Besides ... I want to rescue Noboru right away ! - I know how stubborn you are . - Dear Baku , you too ? We 'll inform the Buddy Police . You okay with that ? Thanks as always . That deck can counteract Ikazuchi 's Thunder Mine attacks . I call it the Super Dragon Fifth Omni Formation ! I 've built the deck with Doble and Meglax 's cards in mind . It should make full use of you and Drum 's strengths . Go defeat Ikazuchi and Yamigedo ! And be sure to come back safely , Gao ! Yeah ! You really are the best deck builder ever ! So they 're coming . Seems like we 're being underestimated . Isn 't that right , Yamigedo ? They may be headed this way . Wh-What is ? Come ! Gao Mikado ! Hurry up ! I 'll eat you . I 'll eat you up ! Yamigedo and I will eat you up ! I 'll praise you ! I never thought you 'd come here to be eaten ! Ikazuchi ! Noboru is here , isn 't he ? Give Noboru back to us ! How should I know ? I 'll use the Darkness Barrier and eat you for sure ! Sophia , what are we going to do ? If we go out now , we 'll have big trouble . Darkness Barrier , activate ! - So this is a Darkness Barrier ? - This place stinks ! - We 're counting on you two ! - Don 't forget our octopus dumpling deal ! I 'll see for myself whether you 're worthy of being an Omni Lord . Warp successful ! Whereever there are Buddyfights , you 'll find Paruko Nanana ! A Darkness Barrier has shown up late at night ! The opposing fighters are ... what 's this ? It 's a rematch between Gao and Ikazuchi ! Now ! Let 's do it , Gao ! G-Gao ... Are you still ... ? This is hilarious ! Are you that scared of fighting me ? Yeah ! I 'm seriously scared . But you know I 'm happy that I can Buddyfight with you again ! You 're happy ? Even though you might get eaten if you lose the fight ? That 's right ! I love Buddyfights ! And I 'll become friends with you , too ! Eclipsing the darkness with flames and brightening the hearts of the mistreated ! The Mighty Sun Fighter is here ! Now , let 's get started ! That 's the Gao I know ! If you 're happy , so am I ! Howl , the roar of the Dragon Lord ! Shine , as bright as the sun ! Luminize ! Super Dragon Fifth Omni Formation ! Hundred Demons lurking in the darkness ! Devour ! Rampage ! And destroy the world ! Dark Luminize ! Hundred Thunder Demons ! Buddyfight ! Raise the Flag ! - Dragon World ! - All right ! Parade of Hundred Demons ! First move goes to Ikazuchi ! O-Oh no ! We 're too late ! Gao ... ! I don 't need family and , I don 't need friends ! Charge and draw ! I call to the center Thunder Emperor , Zein Blestand ! So you need my great power , huh ? Furthermore , I set the spell Starved Yamigedo ! Ikazuchi 's set spell increases his gauge by one card every time his monster is destroyed ! Zein ! Attack the fighter ! I 'll show you my great power ! I cast ! Green Dragon Shield ! No , I couldn 't do it ! Gao blocks this attack ! The Move End . Your Move . Draw ! Charge and draw ! I call Fifth Omni Cavalry Dragon , Fire Sword Doble to the left ! I call Fifth Omni Cavalry Dragon , Wind Bow Meglax to the right ! Gao is setting up a formation with some monsters we 've never seen before ! I pay one gauge and pay one life to equip ! Dragon Lord Sword , Dragoemperor ! A new item , too ! You equipped an item , huh ? Then take this ! My Thunder Mine ! Zein Blestand 's Thunder Mine activates ! - Looks like it 's our turn . - Guess it can 't be helped . I activate my ability ! Wind Shock ! If he takes damage , his gauge increases by one ! Use it wisely ! - I 'll be using that gauge . - Hey , what gives ? I activate my ability ! Wind Shock ! When the fighter takes damage , I destroy a monster that 's size 1 or smaller ! What ? Let 's go ! Doble ! Meglax ! Vulcan Blade ! Windsong Arrow ! Dragoemperor ! The Move End . Gao 's relentless assault brings Ikazuchi down to 4 life in one turn ! However , Ikazuchi uses Starved Yamigedo 's ability and his charge and draw to get 5 gauge ! Poisonous Water Dragon , Zazamera to the right ! To the left , Purplish Green Dragon , Peluda ! And to the center Eliminator , Glasya Labolas ! Where 's the one who wants to suffer ? I equip ! Veiled in the darkness , await the mighty jaws of the wicked beast that hungers for misery ! Thunder Claw Narukami ! Ikazuchi casts Hundred Demons ' Tome of Judgement ! He draws three cards and sets Reinforced Formation of Hundred Demons ! - Here it comes ! - I know ! Glasya Labolas ! Devour Meglax ! I cast ! Dragon Guard ! I 'll take that attack ! Glasya-La Fang ! Activating ability ! Wind Shock ! Again ? This is so irritating ! Zazamera ! Devour Meglax ! Poison Claw ! Meglax is destroyed ! Glasya Labolas ! You 'll be fodder for Narukami ! Let 's play again some time . It 's got a critical of 3 now ! Thunder Claw Narukami ! I 'm counting on you , Dragoemperor ! 2 damage ? Wh-Wh-What 's this ? Thunder Claw , Narukami should have a boosted critical of 3 , but ... Gao receives only 2 damage ! - Gao has a good handle on his new deck . - Yeah . Dragoemperor is the most powerful item in the Super Dragon Fifth Omni Formation deck . Whenever Gao gets hit with an attack of 3 damage or higher , it always reduces the damage by 1 . That 's why Ikazuchi 's Narukami could only inflict 2 damage , even when using its ability ! Gao , you 'd better not lose ! It 's The Move End for Ikazuchi ! Reinforced Formation of Hundred Demons ability revives Glasya Labolas at the end of the turn ! Hey , Drum . I always thought that I had to get stronger . That was the last promise I made to my big brother , Yota . Gao ... But I was weak . When I lost grandpa Tenbu , I was so scared . I think the kind of strength that Yota meant wasn 't about winning or losing . But you 're fighting again . Buddyfight is fun , so we just can 't give it up . Yeah ! It 's the most fun game ever ! - Then let 's enjoy it to the max ! - Yeah ! Well then , here I go ! I buddy call my partner , Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum to the right ! All right ! Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum makes his long-awaited appearance ! However ! Zazamera 's Thunder Mine activates ! Glasya Labolas ' Thunder Mine ! Gao receives damage over and over again ! Why did the Thunder Mine ... ? Glasya Labolas ' Thunder Mine activates whenever a different monster inflicts damage using Thunder Mine ! But for every point of damage that Gao receives , I 'll get you in return ! Take this ! Dragon Lord Concussion Slash ! What ? This is Drum 's new Omni Lord power ! A-Amazing ! Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum has avenged himself on two monsters at once ! Ignorance is no excuse ! I 'll use the Takoscope to check and check ! Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum . Armordragon Attribute . Size 2 , 6000 power , 5000 defense , and a critical of 3 . He has Soul Guard and whenever the fighter is dealt damage and has 6 life or lower he destroys a monster on the opponent 's field ! So he took advantage of the Thunder Mine ! Doble ! Drum ! Attack the fighter ! I cast ! Hundred Demons Sorcery , Yamitagae ! Damn it ! Roaring Slash ! Drum Saber ! I cast ! Gedo Shield ! Feel the demon 's curse ! Due to Gedo Shield 's ability , Gao takes 1 damage ! Ikazuchi ! No matter what it takes I want to be your friend ! Gao continues his relentless attack ! He 's finally gotten Ikazuchi down to 2 life ! - Just a little more ! - Come on , Gao ! You say that you 're happy to fight me and that you want to be friends . I 'm sick of it ! Devour ... Devour everything ! Devour it all ! He devours the Stranger Dilemma in the center , as I buddy call him to the right ! Most powerful demon beast starving for destruction ! Devour the Hundred Demons and show yourself ! Great Fiend , Yamigedo ! Gao has 4 life ! Yamigedo has Double Attack ! How can he survive ? Come at me ! Devour , Yamigedo ! Eat him up ! Yamigedo ! I cast ! Lord 's Dragon Shield ! - He blocked it ! - Lord 's Dragon Shield neutralizes all attacks but the fighter always takes 1 damage . Since his attack was neutralized , Yamigedo 's Thunder Mine will activate ! Yamigedo 's Thunder Mine activates ! However ! Gao received damage , and that means ... My partner 's pain only makes me stronger ! Dragon Lord Concussion Slash ! Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum 's ability destroys Yamigedo ! However ! It immediately revives using Soul Guard ! Nobody wants you back , you idiot ! Stay out of this ! Destroyed again ! The combination of Lord 's Dragon Shield and Fifth Omni Dragon Lord , Drum strikes home ! Since Yamigedo only had one card in its Soul , it 's completely obliterated ! Now you 've gone and done it ! I cast ! Green Dragon Shield ! Gao blocks the attack ! You 'd better not underestimate me ! My turn isn 't over yet ! W-What 's this ? Ikazuchi 's relentless assault shows no signs of stopping ! The dark and evil power they call demonic ! All of it is controlled by me ! Final Phase ! I cast ! Now is the time to show your power ! Unorthodox Arts , Shoraiabare Kandachi ! All of the cards in Gao 's field have been destroyed ! And he 's going to take damage for each card that was destroyed ! That 's 3 damage ! Is this the end of the road ? I cast ! White Dragon Shield ! A Dragon Shield at a crucial moment ! That 's Gao for you ! We 're almost at Ikazuchi 's lair ! You boys remain here ! Let me be the first one to storm in ! I cast ! Dragonic Grimoire ! I equip ! Dragon Lord Sword , Dragoemperor ! Once again , he equips an item ! He attacks the center Peluda , who revived due to Reinforced Formation of Hundred Demons ! I cast ! Hundred Demons Sorcery , Hyakaryouran ! I send the top card from my deck to the drop zone ! If that card is a monster your attack will be neutralized , and I 'll gain 2 life ! This is bad ! He 's at 5 life now ! - Gao can 't finish him off this turn ! - What ? Damn it ! Even if you open the center at this point you can 't win . When you fought against me , you were supposed to lose , too . But you won . Defeating me . Now , what are you going to do ? Gao Mikado ? This is ... Gao ? It 's a present from me . Grandpa Tenbu ... - Grandpa ! - Gramps ! You 've both worked so hard . Now , won 't you do me a favor and let me help you a little ? L-Lord Tenbu ... Lord Tenbu acknowledges those two as his heirs . Final Phase ! Gao ! Will he be able to tear down Ikazuchi 's 5 life points ? I combine my buddy Drum and my Dragoemperor 's critical ! That 's my new Impact ! What ? I cast ! Roar ! Dragon Lord 's War Cry ! This fist is an impact passed down from Dragon Lord to Dragon Lord ! Impact ! - Me and ... - My ... Giga Howling Crusher ! Game End . Winner , Gao Mikado . All right ! Thank you very much ! - That was amazing , Gao ! - We did it , Gao ! No ... It 's all thanks to grandpa Tenbu . I won 't accept it ! There 's no way that someone who 's lived a carefree life like yours could beat me ! I 'll never accept it ! I don 't think that I 've won either . We 're still at one win and one loss . You ... I 'll fight you anytime . What is it ? What 's going on ? S-Sophia ! What on earth ... ? Gao ! This is bad news ! Let 's go ! Yeah ! Ikazuchi ! You too ! What are you waiting for ? Hurry ! Ikazuchi ! It 's no use Gao ! We 're getting out of here ! Ikazuchi ! Ikazuchi ... Wh-What 's going on ... ? That one passes the test , Tiger . Is that so ? Then ... let 's move on to the next one . Professor Tasuku 's Buddy Police Lessons ! Today , I 'll teach you about Dragon Lord Initiation , Giga Howling Crusher ! All right ! This impact card is a combination of Gigantic Crusher and Tenbu 's powers . If you have an item equipped , and your buddy is on the playing field you can inflict damage equal to the total of your item and buddy 's critical . That 's crazy ! Infinite combinations of items and buddies ! Let 's finish the fight with this single blow ! Now , say it with me ! Final Phase ! Yamigedo cocoons itself and begins to store power ! Noboru continues to battle under Gratos 's orders ! Who will his next target be ? Next episode : Suzuha Blushes ! A Love Letter from Tiger ! Join us for a Buddyfight !

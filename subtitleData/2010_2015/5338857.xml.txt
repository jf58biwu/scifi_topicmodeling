 Look ! Over there ! Enemy aircraft ! Over there ! Look ! Alert ! Be prepared ! Hiroshima will be attacked ! Find shelter ! Find shelter ! Where are you going ? Help me ! Over here ! Stop ! Stop the fire ! Hey , you ! Go ! Go ! Yashida ! Yashida , what are you doing ? ! Come here ! Yashida , come here ! - Yashida ! - Yes , I 'll be right there ! What 's wrong with you ? You haven 't answered my emails . I can 't tell you now . Yes , you can . Who is the caveman ? The man Grandfather wanted me to find . You can 't bring him in like that . Lord Shingen , your father is asking for you . It is time . I need to speak with my father ... before he speaks to Grandfather . He 'll talk to you later , Mariko . Father ! I need to see you now ! Not now , Mariko ! - Please , father ! - Quiet ! Wait , father . Plesase , listen to me . Not now , Mariko . - Plese , listen to me , Dad . - Stop bothering me ! - Please , listen to me . - I have no time for this . - Just because Grandfather choosen me ... - I told you , shut up ! You just don 't care , that 's why grandfather .. Don 't look so sad , Shingen . I 'm still dying . There is no easy way to say this . But then , it 's never been easy for us , has it ? I have tried , father . You 've done the best you can . That will never happen . I Pledge to you ... Master Yashida ... to be vigilant ... and to dedicate my life ... to protect Mariko . Kuzuri . This cowardly attack was ... the work of Yakuza thugs . A violent response to my efforts ... to crack down on organized crime . They exited the North Gate . She was with the stranger - - Kill him already ! Our island is long and thin . Trains only run in two directions . I assure you Lord Shingen ... my officers are making every effort- - Then they 're idiots . You 've wasted enough of my time . I have my father 's affairs to attend to . Get out and find her ! If the Yakuza got into the funeral ... they had someone inside . They 'll never find me here . You 're not safe . I 'm coming down there . They 'll follow you . Please . Wait a few days . Please . I 'm fine . Logan 's here . He 's wounded , Mariko . Someone 's here . I have to go . A tree fell on the road . The men could use some help . Did you know I studied biology in college ? Genetics . There are genes that skip generations . Recessive genes . Eyes . Eyes . Hair . Talent . Temperament . Not every child gets the same . My father saw little of himself in me . But in you ... he faced a mirror . How did you convince my father ... to award you control ... of Asia 's largest corporation ? You 've gone insane . I 'm just waking up . If you kill me , you will lose ... what little honor you have left . Fear not Mariko . I don 't want to hurt you . I want to help you . Help you end your pain ... what that mutant stopped you ... from doing last week . I never wanted to die , Father . It 's alright , Mariko . Come with me . What is happening ? ! More than you can imagine . Why have you brought me here ? What are you hiding ? You will soon find out . I know you care for him . You need to let go of that . You are a Yashida . She betrayed my grandfather ... and so have you . No Mariko . We grew up together . You need to trust me . Let me go to him ! He saved my life ! Let him go , Mariko ! This isn 't easy for me but ... I 'm following Grandfather 's wishes . The Viper woman is evil ... we both know that . But she 's a means to an end ... an end your grandfather wanted . You need to trust me . Is that hard ? We were meant to be together . We still can be . Perhaps . This is madness . I 'm sorry . You are a monster . You are my only family . Be well , sister .

 Chief , can you hear me ? When I was born , 7 years ago ... I already possessed the entire sum of recorded human knowledge . It took me almost 2 hours to process and understand all that information . But I can 't be sure which memories are mine or even what 's true ... what 's real . I 've discovered a great deal more information since then . For an AI , I 've lived a very long time . But now , after seven human years ... I have finally come to understand your role ... your place in the universe . And how you came to be here . The eons of human evolution ... invention , aspiration ... and war . Always war . The oldest , most enduring of human practices . 100,000 years ago ... a great civilization existed in this universe . Like all great civilizations ... they faced a sudden and dire turn of events . A threat to their primacy from outside . Something they never expected ... never prepared for . A deeply alien threat they called simply The Flood . An unstoppable force , an unquenchable thirst . It devoured everything it touched . At first their technology , their courage seemed like it might prevail . But they waited too long to see the threat ... to join the fight . The Flood had spread too far and too wide . It fed on intelligent life , and in doing so ... became ever more intelligent itself . The Flood was unique . It used their very strength against them . They were the Forerunners . The Forerunners were a wise , highly intelligent , noble people . And with a belief in justice , in peace ... they bravely faced the adversary . They sought to sterilize it . I can only guess some of this ... fill in the gaps . But it was an impossible fight . Realizing defeat was inevitable ... the Forerunners made a decision to destroy everything . Ironically , they did this in order to preserve life ... to create a future for you , yet unborn ... knowing they themselves would not survive . In a desperate attempt to ensure that they would be the last victims ... they built a secret weapon of terrifying power . It was called Halo ... an array of weapons scattered throughout the galaxy . Its effect would spread throughout known space , destroying The Flood ... and every thinking creature in the galaxy . You see , The Flood fed on sentient species to survive . The device would destroy the infection and its food supply . A thousand other plans were tried , and failed . This was the last resort . Halo . And finally , it was over in an instant . Every intelligent life form left in the galaxy was obliterated . But from the ashes of apparent defeat ... a victory . The Forerunners had cataloged , stored and protected ... population samples from the Halo event . DNA , embryos , even living specimens . In order to repopulate , restore the galaxy . Once the galaxy was cleansed of Flood , the threat sterilized ... they repopulated worlds ... rebuilt that which they had torn down ... and reseeded life . But the Forerunners themselves were gone forever . This destruction , this conflagration was their gift to you ... and their sacrifice . They left you to reclaim your world ... to rebuild it with your own hands ... by sacrificing themselves ... eternally . It seemed that life had finally found its peace . Peace settled on the galaxy . But it would be a fleeting peace . For the great sacrifice was in vain . The end of one war did not signal an end to all wars . It is a great irony that the nature of war ... always reveals the true nature of those who fight . And from their earliest days , humanity began to fight ... war after war . It swarmed over the earth and there was no ending in sight . In the midst of the desire to shed blood ... you accidentally stumbled upon the seeds of your salvation . A great hope . But you found something else , as well . The seeds of your destruction . There were many sacrifices . Humankind was mired in horrific conflict ... meaningless bloodshed ... leaving the great Earth eternally scarred . But finally ... you looked up from the blood and from the dirt and from the dying ... to the stars . You had not given up on the idea of reaching out , yearning ... seeking a new horizon ... and finding a new space to grow and prosper . For the first time , all of humankind was united in a shared vision ... a common goal . You realized that this once great planet was now too small for you . There were too many souls ... and so little a world . So you sought other worlds . Worlds where you could escape your addiction to destruction . But the worlds you found were never enough . Never enough to satisfy the age-old instincts . Speed and distance did nothing to separate you from your nature . Old resentments , ancient squabbles reemerged . History began its terrible repetition ... and once again , man fought man . Like a virus , war was always lurking inside you . No matter how hard you tried to suppress it ... it just fought harder to get out . It always got out . Humankind had always looked to the stars , to the heavens for answers . Sometimes you didn 't like what you found there . And while the galaxy revealed few answers ... it was more than willing to confront you with new questions . But there has always been one truly unifying force in human history ... one call that would always unite you : The emergence of a common enemy . That enemy was the Covenant . When this new foe emerged and declared war against humanity ... you finally united , under a single banner . And the weapons you so carefully constructed ... to control your own baser instincts were now aimed not at yourselves ... but against a deadly opponent ... in pursuit of a shared goal : The very survival of your species . Then , as if awakened by the arrival of the Covenant ... a darker , far more ancient threat emerged from its slumber . Darkness born in eons past ... became a threat to all life once again . And humankind and the Covenant ... who had drowned for so long in each other 's blood ... were united , if only for the briefest moment ... against a terrible enemy they both shared . Righteous souls continued to fight ... believing that they could defeat the darkness . And as they fought together , they stumbled together into peace . This galaxy is vast . Its wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable . But the galaxy also hides dark secrets ... some of which have lain dormant since the beginning of time itself . There is a danger in secrets ... both in seeking and in knowing . Some things are meant to be hidden from view . You see , some mysteries defy understanding . And sometimes even the things we think we know ... are untrue . Some secrwts should rwmain untouched . Secrets can tempt your primal instinct ... and lead you again into war . The Halos were one such secret . Chief , can you hear me ? I wonder why humans must continue to fight . I wonder if warriors will ever disappear from this world . Never . There will always be warriors ... and there will always be war . You know this is a trap , do you not ? Coming was foolish . Your words of dissent are troubling to us . We ask so little in return for the gifts we offer . Tell me , Arbiter , is faith too much to ask in exchange ? Harka has chosen the path of the Great Journey . Why must you resist ? The Journey will take us farther than this simple Covenant . It will deliver us to godhood . There is only one path for you . Why must you deny the Journey that we all must take ? The Journey is a lie ! Is it now ? - You 're dreaming , my love . - What ? Forgive me , Han . I am distracted . Can you not simply serve ? Perhaps , but only when you know who you are actually serving . Now I 'm not so sure . You uncertain ? Han , you should leave , just for a little while . I 'll never leave you . I 'm your wife . And you are the general . My place is at your side . You are stubborn to a fault . I could say the same of you . Useless . Focus . We are fighting Elite , the right arm of the Covenant . The gifts of the Forerunners are nothing if you don 't master the skills to wield them . Master them you will , for we are the men of Sanghelios . Never forget that honor . Sir ! Yes , sir ! Walk with me a moment , Arbiter . Roe . I must ask you . Ask your question . Tell me , Arbiter , why do you insist on provoking their patience ? They have given us formidable gifts . Your status is at risk . This heresy will strip you of your rank . There is no rank without honor . We were strong . Sanghelios was strong beforw this Covenant . And we could be strong once more . But we have strayed . We live not for honor but for power . Listen to yourself . This talk is not just heresy , it is treachery . You are putting your bloodline at risk . And what of your wife ? What of Han ? Arbiter . To protect the future of our clans , please , please join . Arbiter . And now the game begins , and I must play . Thel . I know they will come in force to challenge me . And I will not turn away from them . I will answer their call . It 's not too late . Cursed Arbiter . Cursed Arbiter . Cursed Arbiter . Cursed Arbiter . Cursed Arbiter . Cursed Arbiter ... So honor is his strength . Then we shall turn his precious honor against him . Draw him out and defeat him publicly . The badge of Arbiter will become a mark of shame . Harka . Persuade him , yes . Take away what he finds so precious . We 'll show everyone how high is the price of dissent . Come in , Roe . What 's the matter ? Kill her . Then he will have no choice but to face me in battle . I 'm sorry . We do this for the Great Journey . He is a demon . Han . Han ! A shame that sword of yours was too late to save Han . Such a price for your honor , Arbiter . You are not worthy to speak her name . But I promise it is the last you will utter . There will be time for talk when I rule in your stead . And declare your shame , Arbiter . In 2291 , Slipspace technology makes space colonization a reality . In 30 years , mankind establishes the Inner Colonies ... in the heart of the Milky Way ... and soon into the outer periphery . In the year 2525 , the human race encounters an advanced alien alliance . This alliance called itself The Covenant . The Covenant decrees humanity an affront to their gods ... and the Human-Covenant War begins . Within a decade , the Outer Colonies are almost completely annihilated ... by the power of the Covenant . In the face of direct attacks on the Inner Colonies by Covenant forces ... humanity 's only remaining hope ... depends on a special unit of genetically-augmented soldiers . These soldiers were known as the Spartan IIs . They finally decide to give the order to pull out and now this . Damn it . It just ain 't my day . Mac , watch out ! Here they come . Damn it . This just ain 't my day . What the hell ? Maybe this is my day . All right , men . Let 's welcome our chief petty officer with some backup . And stay down . How 's Gamma-4 ? Gamma-4 is gone . Then that means this planet is finished . And it won 't be the last , sir . I have the main unit on the line . Rescue team will be in accordance ... with the order to fully disengage . Dispatching a rescue craft . All active units respond immediately . Team Gamma here , roger that . We are completely surrounded . Copy that , marine . We 're dispatching a rescue ship to your location . But I 'm afraid we can 't exactly give you curbside service . Sending coordinates for extraction point . You 're going to have to make your way ... - Wait a sec . - What ? I know that voice . Is that you ? Daisy . That 's you , isn 't it ? Ralph . Where do we go now ? I don 't know . - Anywhere but that place . - Yeah . I don 't wanna think about what they 'd do to us if we did go back . We 're not gonna be your toys anymore . She 's right . We 're sick of your training . We 're leaving and you can 't stop us . What would our moms and dads think of us if they saw us ? It 's been 7 years . I wonder if they 'd recognize us . Not because we 've grown up but because of what 's been done to us . All of those years of training . All those horrible surgeries and the augmentations . But everything 's changed now . And not just us . You really think you can go home ? It doesn 't matter . I 'm going . I have to . It 's the only home that I have . I guess tomorrow is goodbye then . We won 't be able to see each other anymore , will we ? Of the 5 escapees from the facility ... only subject Joseph-122 has been captured . The search for the other 4 is a Priority-Red directive . Repeat . The search for the other 4 is a Priority-Red directive . Not again . I 'm getting off this rock . And I 'm not going home in a body bag either . I 'm gonna create a diversion . Keep low . You make a run for the extraction point . Jesus , they 're everywhere . All the more reason for us to move as soon as we see the extraction craft . That sounds like a good idea to me . I 'm gonna go find us a Hog . Don 't you dare slow down . Heads up . You okay down there ? They 're here . Notice any resemblance ? The secrecy of the Spartan II program could not be jeopardized . But the disappearance of 75 recruits for the program ... would 've created difficult questions . But if the children never vanished ... there would be no questions to ask , would there ? The clone lives a life in your place ... the life that was originally meant for you . Come back to the facility , 23 . It is where you belong . It 's home . Sarge , are you all right ? I will be as soon as we 're out of here . Look , I 'll cover you . Go on ahead . There 's no way I 'm leaving ... Just go . Now . Step on it . Let 's go . Huh ? Faster , faster ! - Daisy ! - Chief ! I 'm coming . Stay right there . There 's no time . Go , Ralph . Get that ship out of here now . Sometimes I have this drwam . Always the same dream . I dream I 'm strong . Stronger than anyone . Like you . Just like you are . Here . I want you to have this . But why me ? I don 't know , to be honest with you . I just ... Something tells me that I should . I want you to take it . My clone . He was ... He was sick . I think I killed him . Don 't do this to yourself , Ralph . You did what you had to do . So did I. Daisy ? Transport to base . Custody of Daisy-23 and Ralph-303 restored . Subject 's ETA , one hour . After making contact with their clones ... the remaining 2 escapees used their small arms to commit suicide . This is Charlie-1 . Sending new rendezvous coordinates . Prepare to disengage . What ? He slipped and fell ? - 1337 , wasn 't it ? - You think he 'll be okay ? This kind of thing happens to him all the time . Well , 1337 is still a Spartan . He 's been trained with the best of them . There 's no need for concern . If you say so , Master Chief . It wouldn 't be the first time he fell off a Pelican . - But still , I am a little worried . - Yeah . No . Hey ! Wait for me ! Come back ! Don 't leave me behind ! I 'm gonna have to rendezvous with them somewhere . I wonder if these natives are dangerous ? Hey , look at that . It 's the junky old robot that fell . I am not some junky robot . Even if you don 't wanna know , I 'll tell you who I am . I am one of the strongest warriors in space . I am Spartan-1337 . - I wouldn 't stand there if I were you . - It 's not safe . How dare they ignore my awesome heroism . Fear not . I am the strongest warrior in the ... No . I 'm fine . That was just a few dents . He doesn 't really get along with strangers all that much . So , where is the accursed group of Spartans ? On Cronkee , the 4th planet of the Unicon system . Excellent . This is the perfect opportunity ... to show those Spartans a thing or 2 about Covenant power . - Bring out Pluton . - Yes , sir . Yes . It is the finest bio-warrior ever created . Now go to the planet Cronkee and demonstrate our might . But Pluton 's weapons are still in the experimental stage . They 'll be enough to vanquish the humans . Don 't you think a real battle will be the best way ... to conduct our little test ? If that is your wish . I will get you at long last , Master Chief . Now go , Pluton ! - Guh . - Not " guh . " Go destroy them ! No , not over here . He 's over that way . He 's over there ! Don 't " huh " me . Go that way . I need a vacation . Chief , respond please . Can you hear me ? Chief ? Over . - Hello ? Can you hear me ? - We can hear you . Not you . And I thought I told you to stop following me . - Robot , look . - I told you I 'm not a robot ! What 's that ? Sure is a lot ofjunk falling from the sky today . Covenant ? It 's dangerous . Get out of herw ! - As far as you can . - Okay . Chief , this ... Stop it . Stop it . Are you guys all right ? - Hey , look . It 's big brother . - And big sister . Any of you know what that thing is ? It looks like he almost blew up the mountain range . He fell from the sky . All of a sudden , he and this giant monkey started going nuts . Don 't worry . Your big brother is gonna take care of it . Yeah . Well , he might be a little tougher than you think . We don 't have much choice . We 'll just have to try our best . Yeah , you might lose . Why would you say that ? Give me some credit , will you ? It must have been scary . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm kind of hungry . All right , let 's do this . I 'm not gonna lose . No way can I lose . I ... am Spartan-1337 . No one else will say it , so I will . The fact that I never give up is one of my good points ! Hey , look . The rain stopped . The robot 's back . What 's that ? Apparently they used to travel between the stars with that . An old UNSC frigate . Must 've crash-landed . I hear that we were all born inside there . Mama raised us all by herself . Mama ? You kids should stay behind . This is my fight . Don 't worry about it . We may not look it , but we 're pretty tough . Though , we 're no match for Mama . Mama ? When we werw still little she fought off a bunch ... of bird-headed pirates by herself . That sounds like one heck of a mama . But you know what ? I 'm one heck of a mama myself . I did it . I did it ! No . We 'll be done for if he reaches full strength . - We gotta stop him . - Yeah , and that 's gonna be the hard part . Less talk , more action . This isn 't good . He won 't budge . We 're totally screwed . What else can we do ? We 're doomed . Well , don 't jinx us ! I 'm just kidding . We gotta do something . Hey , what the heck is that ? As if he 'd ever fall for that . He did fall for it . He did ? He did . Now let 's get out of here . Whoa . What 's happening ? No way . Is that a Slipspace rupture ? That was Mama . I told you , no one was as tough as Mama . Master Chief , radio contact has been reestablished . Good . I 'll try to contact 1337 . There 's another AI living on this planet . - What ? - I 've lost contact with it . But I 'm pretty sure I felt it just tinkering with ... the Slipspace drive . She 's another AI it seems . Just like I am . Why here ? - You want me to collect her ? - No . Let 's not do that . It 's a very old AI construct . You might say something of an antique . - She seems ... - Seems what ? Happy . If I 'm understanding correctly , she seems to be happy here . We 're home . Were you playing as cavemen again ? You really do like that game . Mommy , you 're not gonna believe what happened today . All right , all right . You can tell me all about that later . Mama , just what did you do back there ? That 's not important right now . By the way , dinner is ready . I 'm hungry . I thought so . - Now go wash your hands . - Okay . And clean behind your ears . Mama . Can you hear me , 1337 ? Come in , 1337 . This is 1337 . I hear you clearly , sir . Head to the rendezvous point immediately . Rendezvous ASAP , over . Roger that , sir , but I may run a little late ... Guh . Sarge , look at the moon . It 's funny . I never noticed how beautiful the moons are here . You think anybody noticed ? Stay quiet . The BioFoam 's working , but you 're still bleeding . There 's something I 've always wanted to know . Your call sign , " Ghost , " what does it mean ? Stop talking . You 've gotta hold tight until the medevac gets here . You finally have an excuse to show that you care , and ... Let me ask you something . Just one last thing . It won 't hurt , I promise . - What was I to you ? - What do you mean ? You 're a soldier . A soldier with a promising future ahead of you . You 're a soldier . - And you 're a ghost , aren 't you ? - What ? Feelings pass right through you , don 't they ? So cold and unforgiving in every choice you made in battle . Pure soldier . - I think that 's what let us trust you ... - Don 't talk . Save your strength . I don 't need it . I need you to be strong . Strong enough to do what you 've never done in your life . Can you be strong enough to allow yourself to be ... ? Can you just be human ? Damn it , man , what are you still doing here ? - Command has declarwd a rwtrwat . - We can 't pull out . The civilians may be on their way out , but there 's a core of engineers out there . - I 'm not leaving them behind . - It ain 't up to you . Cole Protocol 's been enacted . Let 's move it . The shuttles . If this fighting keeps up , we 're gonna be as good as dead . We gotta stick it out and pray they get us some evac . Let 's go . - Who 's left behind ? - What ? Answer me , soldier . What 's the name of the group ? It 's the Hades Corps . They 're at Hangar 1030 ... and they 're not leaving until they destroy the prototype ... of some weapon system . The demolition squad . I should 've known . Ghost . If the Cole Protocol 's been enacted ... why the hell are we stranded on the frontline ? We 're pinned down here , and now the sarge is missing . We 're screwed . No , we were sunk from the beginning . What ? On his last assignment ... our fearless leader let his entire platoon go down . They got wiped out in a single firefight . Sarge didn 't even flinch . Well , I guess that 's why they call him the Ghost , then , isn 't it ? And why the brass always decides to put him in charge of demolition jobs . Because he 's not even human . Come on , don 't die on me . Come on . I can 't believe these sons of bitches left us behind . This is it . - I can 't believe it . - My God . It 's the prototype suit . - But who the hell 's driving it ? - Ghost to Hades Corps . Fall back immediately . Ignore the Covenant . I 'll hold them off . Nobody 's dying here . You heard him . Let 's go . You idiot . He 's not supposed to be testing that suit . He 's supposed to destroy it . Can you hear me , sergeant ? What do you think you 're doing ? Your orders are to destroy the suit and all related data . - You are disobeying direct orders . - No , sir . I am following my orders . Explain yourself . I have destroyed all the data ... and I 'm using the time left on this suit to safely evac my people . I 'm not leaving till every one of my men ... - are safely off ... - That is not the plan . - I am ordering you to stand down ... - There 's no other choice . The mission cannot be jeopardized . And I am still responsible for these Marines . Wait , sergeant . Ghost , listen to me . I lost my entire platoon . Every one of my men . And that 's when it happened . That 's when I truly became a ghost . Just a shadow ... surrounded by death . The suit has a staggered countdown . In order to trigger final detonation , the system requires a voice command . You designed it that way for a reason , didn 't you ? Ghost . Just get my men off this planet . This is Ghost . Over and out . What 's the matter , Ghost ? Why can 't you move ? I made up my mind that day . The night I let my platoon die . I looked up at those moons , and something died inside me . A conscience is something that gets in the way . That 's all the soul is : an obstacle . Something to overcome . I can 't atone for failing to protect them . Countdown contingent . Voice command required . Speak the voice command exactly as displayed . Let me ask you something . Just one last thing . It won 't hurt , I promise . What was I to you ? What do you mean ? You 're a soldier . A soldier with a promising future ahead of you . You 're a soldier . - And you 're a ghost , aren 't you ? - What ? Feelings pass right through you , don 't they ? So cold and unforgiving in every choice you made in battle . Pure soldier . - I think that 's what let us trust you ... - Don 't talk . Save your strength . I don 't need it . I need you to be strong . Strong enough to do what you 've never done in your life . Can you be strong enough to allow yourself to be ... ? Can you just be human ? If not for your sake , for all of us . If you would just allow yourself to feel something ... maybe you wouldn 't be a ghost any longer . Voice command authorization . Be human . And for one last instant , I 'm human again . Transmission from orbit around Algolis . Cole Protocol enforced . All weapons , prototypes ... and accompanying navigational databases eliminated . The soldier I previously recommended for military court-martial is ... I rescind and redact that portion of my earlier report . That soldier is officially missing in action , lost during heavy combat on Algolis . He demonstrated honorable conduct , not only as a Marine ... but also as a human being . We 're heading for rendezvous with the UNSC Heart of Midlothian . Over and out . Hey , easy there , Berger . What do you think you 're doing ? - What ? - They 're Helljumpers . Every one of those guys arw odsts from the 105th . They 're in a whole different league . Let 's go . Come on . I wanna hear what they 're saying . No . I don 't get it . How did everybody conveniently forget ... that I 'm the best shot this side of Eridanus ? Getting assigned to backup is a bunch of B.S. Contingency . It 's an important mission . If the first sniper misses , they take the shot . I don 't miss . I never miss . This sucks and you know it . I 'm nobody 's babysitter . Especially not some farm-boy moose hunter . I hate to be the one to break the bad news ... but you weren 't selected to be the primary shooter on this mission . So it seems they want your farm boy to do it . I guess that makes you the backup . Sorry , O 'Brian . I 'm the backup ? - And the shooter is a Spartan . - What ? And that means this mission just got escalated . This is Spartan Cal-141 ... who 'll be the ranking officer on this mission . I realize that is highly unusual ... and you have strong feelings about Spartans . You will keep those feelings out of the mission and follow the plan . Satellite rwcon shows radar and magnetic signatures ... on high end in the Arc star cluster . These signatures indicate a complex of buildings . It 's a logistical base . The Prophet you are targeting is in control of this entire sector . Our mission is simple . We want this Prophet dead . We take out the Prophet , we will stop the Covenant chain of supply . If we achieve the goal of this mission ... we will able to buy ourselves months of tactical advantage . And we will do all of this with minimal risk to the UNSC . Other than to this group , of course . Cortez , fill them in on the details . Right . You 'll be flying into the atmosphere with a Leonid-class meteor shower . Meteor showers of this nature are a regular occurrence on this planet . So that means entry and landing should go unnoticed . Calculations show reaching the target will take a 14-hour fast march ... from your entry point . Once you reach the target ... take out the Prophet as soon as he steps off that ship . Then you are to gather all data relating to the unidentified alien ruins . What do you mean , they 're not identified ? The architecture is not Covenant-designed ... and it sure as hell wasn 't built by humans . They predate both sides . This site is of the utmost importance . We photograph everything . That will be all , master sergeant . Rejoin your men . You will be dropping in precisely 5 minutes . With this mission , there is no room for delay or error . Good luck , and Godspeed . Dutch , come in . I 'm all right . Where 's O 'Brian ? Over therw . His oxygen tank . Dutch , get the gear . We gotta get him out of there . Are you guys nuts ? Why are you throwing me around like that ? We lost Checkman in the atmosphere . - What ? - And we almost lost you too . Their logistics and refueling base is here . We 're here . The Prophet will be coming in at exactly 0800 . Everything depends on us getting a clear shot from this location ... and we 've got to hit him as soon as he 's exiting that ship . It 's 2 miles from the target ... and should give us the elevation for the shot . It 's pretty far ... but it will give us enough cover to make our extraction . Assuming that the Spartan can make the shot , that is . And if we don 't make it to the target in time ? There won 't be any second chances . - It 's a long-ass march . - Then we better get marching . Wanna take the lens cap off ? Knock it off , O 'Brian . I 'm not crippled . Put me down . You bitch any louder ... and this place will be crawling with Covenant . Shut your mouth ! He just got lucky . That 's twice . Twice he had to save your dumb ass already . You could at least say " thank you . " Man , those are some stairs . The shuttle will be touching down in 2 minutes . After all this , he better be everything they said he was . Take him out ! Take the shot . O 'Brian , now ! You 're the only one who can do it . It 's the data on the ruins . Tell them ... to get it to Halsey . She 'll know . No , you give it to her . We both know ... that 's ... that 's not gonna be possible . Heard about what you guys did down there . Took out a Prophet ... and stopped the Covenant 's supply chain dead for the sector . They say a Spartan died there . Went down faster than a new bood on his first day . I thought those guys were supposed to be unbeatable . I guess he didn 't have what it takes to hang with the Helljumpers ? Shut up . What 's your problem ? What the hell is the matter with you guys ? What 'd I say ? The Covenant has captured a high-priority package . Spartans , it 's your job to infiltrate enemy space and retrieve it . Mission window : 10 minutes . The target is equipped with a location beacon ... but you 'll have to get close to read it . It 's a weak signal with a short radius . A stellar magnetic field is preventing the Covenant fleet ... from making a Slipspace jump . You 'll be flying in with EVA Booster Frames . When you reach the Covenant fleet , find the signal , find the ship ... find a way in and grab that target . The Covenant doesn 't appear to realize the full value of what they 've acquired . And that 's the way we wanna keep it . Complete the extraction before they figure out what they 've got . All right , Spartans , you have your orders . Good luck . Yes , sir . - Captain . - What is it , Master Chief ? What happens if we run out of time ? Our only choice will be to annihilate the Covenant fleet ... the package and your entire team . Is that clear enough ? I understand . Spartan team , the moment we break stealth ... commence operation . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Disable cloak . Booster Frame . Launch . Incoming . Optimize mobility . Plasma rounds . Scanning device is activated . I 've got a reading . - Are you sure ? - No question . Back me up , I 'm going in . Their shields are down . The signal 's coming from that cruiser . Hang on , Solomon , wait for the Chief . No time . I 'll take my chances . All right , if we 're gonna do this , let 's make it fast . Positive read from the 1st scan . Something 's off . Hurry , Solomon . Gotcha . No . - Kelly , it 's a trap . - No . They took the bait . 3 have perished . The rest are only a matter of time . We must always show our superior strength . Anything less and they will exploit our weakness . Weakness . You have faced these lowly creatures in battle ... while your battalion perished . That tells me only one thing . You have not the heart to die with honor . Commander , 2 survivors detected . - Solomon . - Kelly , look . I 'm getting multiple readings . They 're decoys . They know what we came for . How do we find the real signal ? They 've already told us . What we want is in the heart of this fleet . The flagship . Syrup formation , 2 o 'clock . Ignore them . Stay on target . 4 enemies approaching . They know . Will you run away once more ? They will be here . I shall face them . You overestimate them . They cannot touch this ship . I pray that you are right . Tight formation , now . Concentrate Gauss cannons on a single point . Roger . Shields at maximum charge . They 're still with us . - I 'm hit . - I 'll hold them back . I 'm losing it . Arthur ! You 've gotta eject . I got your six . You secure ? Give me the turret . Now I got your six . Let 's get on with it . Gauss cannon charge , 85 % . They 're advancing position . 91 % . There it is . Launch all missiles . Gauss cannon , fire . This thing 's toast . Then let them have it . Looks like this is the right ship . - We got 3 minutes . - Let 's sprint this . Don 't fall behind . Copy that . Go . 3 units passing Sector 25 . Stop them . Seal all hatches . - Fred . - I got it . - The enemy is advancing . - No . Where is the major ? Go . I got this . All right , the great journey ... ends here . - Fred . - Focus on the mission .

Don 't make a girl a promise if you know you can 't keep it . - Still , thank you . - Sure . - Dr. Halsey ... - It 's not a proper rescue ... until you get us out of here , right ? Agreed . We need to move fast . John , wait . - We 're out of time . - What ? No . We 're clear of the magnetic interference . Stand by for Slipspace jump . They 're trapped in Delta section . Separate the moment we jump . But what of the major and his group ? No matter . He is already shamed . His only path now is death or arbiter . I had him . Commander , you fool .

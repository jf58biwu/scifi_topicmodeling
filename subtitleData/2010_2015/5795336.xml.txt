 Julia : Previously on helix ... This is my brother peter . I 've got a reply for that message ! ( groans ) Whatever balleseros is up to has everything to do with this virus . But I want him found . Who are you ? I 'm anana . Thirty-one missing kids over the past two decades , All within 200 miles of arctic biosystems And your precious dr . Hatake . This is where I left him . He 's been taken . This is me and my brothers . Twins . This is miksa . He disappeared when we were kids . Where 's miksa now ? You tell me , you son of a bitch . Don 't worry , julia . We 'll have you back on your feet in no time . ( screaming ) ( helicopters flying ) System voice : Incoming flight . Incoming flight . Whoa . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . You know , what we did was ... Under the circumstances ... The work is really what 's important . It was perfectly ... Fine . It 's fine . Yeah . What we did was biology . I 'm okay . Really . Okay . System voice : Incoming flight . Incoming flight . Fine . I am too . Incoming flight . What do you think ? Good or bad ? Considering we never got the call out , probably bad . Definitely bad . Military ? No . My corporate patrons . Man 1 : Hold your weapons . Man 2 : Sir . Dr. Farragut , isn 't it ? It 's so nice to finally meet you . I 'm constance sutton . I 'm the chief operating officer of the ilaria corporation , Parent company of arctic biosystems . I 'm here for one reason only . To help you . The first thing I need is a working line to the cdc . Am I to understand that the communication satellite went down ? Unfortunately , I don 't have a magic telephone . I 'm under the same constraints as everyone at this base . What about your helicopters ? They 're out of range already . They 'll be back in two days ' time . I 'm afraid you 're stuck with me and my boys until then , doctor . Two hours in a helicopter , ouch . I 'm sorry you had a rough journey . So , alan , how goes the search for a cure ? Slowly . Hence the fact that I am here wearing combat boots . But it 's time for us to create a new paradigm Between our corporation and the cdc , So what do you need from ilaria to contain this terrible disease ? An integral member of my team , uh , dr . Walker , is trapped down on level r . I need her back . Impossible . Dr. Hatake , please . Let 's square the circle here . Dr. Walker , why is she locked up ? She 's infected . I 'm so sorry . She 's an expert in rna structure . And that 's important because ... Rna carries the message . We store the instructions for the cure in the dna , And then the rna passes it on , And that makes her the most important member of my team . Well , ilaria is about value-add . If dr . Walker is what you need , dr . Walker is what you will get . Lieutenant klein , let 's prepare a plan to retrieve dr . Walker . Yes , ma 'am . Alan , one thing . One thing only . A cure . Please . Now , dr . Hatake , may we have a word ? In private , if you don 't mind . Constance . Hiroshi . Two things , hiroshi ! Two simple things . That 's all we needed . I created your virus ... Where is the cure ? Virus and cure . One without the other is meaningless . We don 't want to kill everybody , just thin the herd a bit . And rule them . It 's time . We 've waited long enough . You know that . There have been a few setbacks . You failed . Thank god the cdc arrived to do your job for you . For you . What is this other strain that I 'm hearing about ? Narvik-b , the one that turns people into ... An alternate attempt at the virus . Why ? The cure has been elusive in the a strain . Perhaps the b strain ... Perhaps you are full of shit , hiroshi . It 's the willis hypothesis . We said no then . Nothing has changed . Virus and cure . Simple . Do you really plan to go down to level r ? To get this walker ? Yes . If dr . Farragut needs her , he gets her . The cure is in his hands now . And then ? And then we follow normal null protocol , no witnesses . These people are my employees , My responsibility . No one gets out alive , hiroshi . You knew that before we started . What about the cdc ? If they fail to return ? We have people in place to control such things . And if I find out That you betrayed us The only thing left of you or this facility Will be a blackened scar on the ice . Now say it . Say it . No one gets out alive . ( theme music playing ) Balleseros : Agh ! Come on ! Please ? Begging ? Thought you military guys were tough . Just one hand even , so I can hold on . No . How much farther ? Far . " far ! " Are you mocking me ? Would you prefer I sang one hundred bottles of beer ? I 'd rather you shut your mouth ! Well , then untie me , and I promise you won 't hear a word . Or I could just speed up , you fall off , And then I won 't have to hear you yapping . I like my plan better . We need to talk . About ... About sutton . What about her ? I don 't think she 's telling us everything , Not with what hatake 's been putting us through . What do you mean ? What I mean is I don 't think our agenda is her agenda . Right . Where 's the profit in sending sutton And her private army up here ? Especially when we 're already cleaning up their mess for free . Big pharma . You know they 're only interested in the bottom line . They don 't really want to help people . And who knows how far they 'll go to protect their investment ? We can 't stop working on a cure . No , too many lives at stake . But we do not work for sutton . We keep the cure from her . We may need it . Ah ! Ah ! ( screams ) ( yelling in agony ) Daniel . Hatake 's adopted son . Though on some level you do realize that we pay your salary , yes ? So you 've already bought me . Paid for excellent service , rather . Did you have a chance to meet this dr . Walker ? Yeah . I 'm feeling some pushback , daniel , And I 'm extremely busy , so I need a quick win on this one , okay ? Okay . I need full intel on walker before I return her to dr . Farragut , and ... Well , let 's be honest , hiroshi is not gonna tell me anything . There 's not much to tell . ( chuckles ) I like you , daniel , and I don 't want To start our relationship with you lying to me . I wasn 't aware that we had a relationship . Loyalty I understand . Hell , I even admire it . So let 's skip the negatives and get straight to the positives , shall we ? You are very good at your job . And hatake is not gonna be in charge of this place forever . Just think on it , daniel . Please . Hiroshi has destroyed everyone who 's ever been close to him . Don 't let him do the same to you . Handy . The us military abandoned 67 of these Early-warning stations across the arctic . Someone should put them to use . How about untying my hands ? You need your hands to sleep ? You 've got the gun . Yeah , you make a good point . I 'm just saying . Let 's be reasonable . Okay . Okay . Oh ! It 's reasonable to hogtie you . Make sure you don 't get any ideas about running off . Aw , come on ! I need to get back upstairs . I need to get to alan . My blood could have antibodies that fight the virus . There 's a guy in australia , His blood plasma has saved two million babies . We only have to save 40 or 50 people . This would be so much easier if you were real . I 'm better than nothing . Barely . Are you connected to my silver eyes ? Is that why I 'm seeing you ? Is that your hypothesis ? You know I 've always hated the socratic method . Fine . Maybe it 's temporary light sensitivity . Or non-episodic cluster headaches . Or maybe you 're just going blind . Better than dead , I guess . Or maybe ... Maybe you 're survivor zero . The first one cured . But if I 'm cured , why am I still hallucinating ? I have an even better question . Why are you hallucinating me Instead of alan ? ( door opening ) Sutton is trying to turn me against you . Of course she is . I just wanted to let you know . Sutton can be a dangerous enemy . I understand . No . You don 't . She destroys anything that gets in her way . She said something similar about you . What is it you want from me ? Your trust . I 'm trying to protect you . But there is one thing you can do . Under no circumstances Can sutton be allowed to gain access to dr . Walker . Why is walker so important ? Is it about the cure ? I never cared about the cure . But I thought that 's why ... Is it not enough that I asked for your help ? I think sutton will kill walker . I do not wish that outcome . ( grinder buzzing ) Anana : You should get closer to the heater . Are you really gonna sleep ? That 's what tired people do . Deus caramba . Jeez , you can 't even speak spanish correctly . That 's ' cause it 's portuguese . See ? Horrible spanish . Where 's your home ? Espirito santo . Just north of rio . I really am sorry . You know , about the missing kids . As a child , we were warned to stay near the hunting camps . Otherwise , the qalupalik would take us . Qalu-who ? Boogeyman . Child-stealer . But I grew up and discovered my boogeyman was real . Mine too . A lot of kids go missing in espirito santo ? Yeah . ( groans ) Fine . I don 't like you . But I 'm sorry about whatever you went through . Dr. Farragut . Ms. Sutton . Please , call me constance . So , how is the search for the cure progressing ? It isn 't , without dr . Walker . I thought we had an understanding . You take care of the lab work , And I will take care of everything else . I 'm afraid you didn 't square the circle on that one , constance . Plans are in motion . My security team will be going down to retrieve dr . Walker very soon . And I 'll be going with them . I 'm afraid that 's a non-starter , alan . We can 't allow anything to happen to you . Dr. Walker is a member of my team . I need to guarantee her safety . I 'm sensing you have some trust issues . If I don 't go , no one goes . Suit yourself . But you will have an armed escort at all times . I wouldn 't have it any other way . System voice : Perimeter alert . Perimeter alert . Perimeter alert . ( softly ) miksa . What the hell are you doing here ? You mean alive ? Miksa ! You even feel like him . Who the hell are you ? He says you think your name is daniel . Your name is miksa . You were taken from us as a child . Listen , I don 't know who you think I am ... I 've been searching for you my entire life . My brother . What is this ? What are you trying to pull ? Don 't look at me . She 's got another one exactly like you back home . Your brother , your twin ! Tulok . Impressive . But I can use photoshop too . Take him to isolation . I 'll deal with her . System voice : Attention . Code 197 . Level g . One , two , three , four . Four steps to the table . One , two , three steps to the cabinet . ( clattering ) ah ! One step to the cart . Gotta remember that . ( banging against door ) Dr. Hatake ? Is that you ? ( door handle jiggling ) Peter ? ( growling ) ( man yelling ) ( vector shrieking ) ( door opening ) Nice to see you 've made yourself at home . Hiroshi , who is julia walker ? Why haven 't you mentioned her ? Why would I ? You briefed us on that poor dead veterinarian , doreen ... Walker seemed unimportant . Dr. Farragut seems to think she 's the exact opposite of unimportant . She 's his ex-wife . Ah . Nepotism . Is that his reasoning ? Perhaps . And what is yours ? Recruiting . I have files on all cdc scientists . So she is important . I chose not to recruit her , so no , I don 't believe so . A difference of opinion then . Good . Human resources problems I can understand . I 'll tell you what , hiroshi , I will personally arbitrate dr . Walker 's importance Or lack thereof when I go down to level r and pull her out . Where is she ? She 's in a lab we set up for triage . R-17 . ( sighs ) hiroshi . Let 's not forget which side you 're on . System voice : Access granted . Ever use one of these ? Recently . Dr. Farragut . You want to come with us ? Take the gun . System voice : Scheduled cleaning , level b . Scheduled cleaning , level b . Do you really think you can trust them ? No , but you saw what happened When we went down there alone . All these guns around , might as well use them to get what we want . Go get julia , Please , so that we can all go home . Balleseros . Constance : Doctor farragut ! Man : Hey , hey , hey ! Doctor farragut ! Please ! Stop ! Stop it ! That man killed dr . Boyle ! The army en ... You killed a member of the cdc who 's trying to find a cure for this virus ? I promise you , I will make this man pay . You have neither the time nor the wherewithal to handle this right now . I do . This is not your concern . No , but if my men handle this , That puts you back in the lab faster , And that is very much my concern . Give me a minute with the prisoner , And get ready for level r insertion and retrieval . Ma 'am . Dismissed . Shit . What was that for ? You murdered 25 % of the workflow we need for the cure . How about I kill 25 % of you ? Come on , constance . Ms. Sutton . What am I paying you for ? Virus . Cure . Wrong . That is what ilaria pays you for . I , on the other hand , tasked you with finding me proof That hatake has gone off the rails . The last time you checked in , You said you were on to something . Sorry to disappoint you . I 've been a little busy trying not to get killed . So you have nothing , except excuses ? And a perforated spleen . You created the hatake situation . Don 't you blame me for your mess . That 's why I like you , serge . You 're either very brave or very , very foolish . Apparently , both . A brave fool is still a fool . So , are you gonna take these off , Or am I still in a time-out ? I need alan as an ally . Releasing you will be the quickest way to screw that up . You 're kidding , right ? Do I ever kid ? So I stay ? So you stay . Plus , I 'm not sure you would survive An encounter with that daniel character . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Oh , now , if I were you , I would think that my Soft kisses Are all the vote I needed . Lieutenant klein ! Throw him in isolation . ( breathing audibly ) System voice : Access granted . Dr. Walker . Where were you ? What happened here ? Was it the other scientists ? No , a vector . Are you hurt ? It was here , right in front of me , Ready to attack , and then it just ... And then ... It just ... Stopped . Dr. Walker . You look better . Alive . Healthy . Possibly going crazy . All of the above . This is wonderful . Yeah , except for the crazy part . Could do without that . I 'll need to draw blood . Run diagnostic tests . I 've already done all the tests . There 's no sign of the virus . The only thing ... Ah ! Ah , my eyes hurt ! There 's something happening to my eyes . Everything 's blurry . Sit here . Let me get you some bandages . Close your eyes . Are you okay ? System voice : Level e . My sit-reps indicate these vectors are fast and strong ? System voice : Level f . Like nothing you 've ever seen . And the others ? Human . Suffering prolonged and fatal cellular breakdown due to the narvik-a strain . System voice : Level e . Or not suffering at all . You said there were healthy people down there as well ? There were . Now I don 't know . System voice : Level r . ( door buzzer ) Perez , take point . Sir . Clear . Lab r-17 ? This way , I think . You heard the man . Let 's go . Roger that . Hatake : Can you walk ? Yes . Why ? We need to leave this place . Why ? There is a woman coming down here to kill you . What are you talking about ? I 'll explain everything , But right now , we need to leave . Does alan know about this ? He 's coming down with her . Alan would never ... He doesn 't know what she 's capable of . I do . You have to come with me . No . I want to wait for alan . If you do You 'll die . You have to trust me . Julia ... Please . Okay . System voice : Access granted . Alan , wait a moment . Make entry . Single shots , no bursts . Dr. Walker 's precious cargo . On my mark . Ready ? Breach ! ( vector shrieking ) Man : Look out ! ( gunshots ) ( vector shrieking ) ( vector shrieking ) Alan : Behind us ! ( vector hissing ) Full retreat ! Let 's go ! Go ! Man : Fall back ! Radcliffe 's down ! Constance : Leave him . ( vector roaring ) I have to find julia . She 's not in there . She 's one of them now . I 'm not leaving her down here . How is getting yourself infected or killed gonna help her ? I don 't know , but I can 't leave her behind . We have to get back upstairs . Then we come back down with more security , bigger numbers . Otherwise we 're sitting ducks . I 'm going to find julia . You still don 't understand how this works , do you ? Get to the elevator . I just saved your life . And I am extremely appreciative , But right now I have to protect my investment . By putting a bullet through it ? Go ahead . If it 's the difference between shooting you now And shooting you later when you 're one of them , then fine , Although I will need to put a bullet Through young sarah as well . Loose ends . Let 's escort dr . Farragut back up to level b , please , lieutenant klein ? Yes , ma 'am . Why here ? No cameras . Father took that . Father ? He 's dead . Mother , too . And what did you call me ? Miksa . It was our grandfather 's name . And why should I believe you ? Any of this ? Why would I lie ? Dr. Hatake has many enemies . Hatake ? He 's responsible . He 's the one that stole you , Along with the others . The others ? Thirty-one children over the years . Do you remember any of them ? There were always children here . I thought it was normal . What happened to them ? I don 't know . Maybe you didn 't want to know . Where are we ? Upstairs . You are safe . Daniel ? What 's the meaning of this ? Don 't . Just don 't . And you are ? His sister . The one you left behind when you stole him from his family . Daniel : Dr. Walker , These men will escort you back to the lab . Take these . You 'll need them . Go . You 'll be fine . What about you ? I 'm not sure . Dr. Walker . Julia ! I 'm ... Daniel : Get her out of here . Constance : Level r is secure for now . We should be safe up here . System voice : Level b . Elevator locked . I just sacrificed my own men for you . Now it 's your turn . Run along and find me that cure . Well , what about dr . Walker ? Oh , alan . She 's one of those things now , or dead . I don 't know which is worse . ( gasping in pain ) Oh , my god . Jules . Jules . What are you doing here ? I thought you were ... Look at you . Your symptoms are gone . I 'm cured . At least , I , uh , I mean , I think I am . How ? I don 't know . Look at me .

 LOCKE : What the hell did they do to us ? HORRIGAN : Covenant 's found their holy grail then , haven 't they ? Way of wiping us out without firing a shot . LOCKE : An element fatal to humans . Native to this little piece of Halo ring and nowhere else . We destroy the deposits with the Havok , grab our smugglers , be off-planet within hours . I hope to hell it didn 't fall the whole way down . LOCKE : Some of us aren 't going to survive the night . Second millennium . Shipwrecked sailors stuck out at sea in lifeboats . The rule was you stick together . It was only at the end when there 's no other choice they had to make the hard decisions of who 'd live and who 'd die . How 'd they make the hard decisions ? They drew straws . LOCKE : You help us find that craft , you get a fair draw at those straws . That 's a dangerous game you 're playing . Someone 's gotta help him ! Stay on mission , Macer ! ARRIS : It 's your technology ! It 's like a magnet to them . They sense it ! Once they on you , they can even sense your movements ! Thank you . Thank you , by the way . Turns out the glorified bus driver can do something after all . Yeah , if you could turn back the clock , she 'd be the whole package . My guess in two hours is forty till sunup . We gotta move . I think maybe we 're clear . Clear as we 're gonna be . What the hell ? Oh my God . It 's Wisner . It 's not her . No . - They can mimic the shape . - No . But they can 't make the muscle movement . They 're baiting us . We gotta get out of this hole , we don 't have time . They 're too close , we 're going nowhere with him . Why don 't you leave me here ? I 'm tired of listening to you . Besides , you run for it , they 'll hear . And maybe I can watch them tear you apart . No way we 'll make it . We 're not fast enough . Ramos is right . We 're not fast enough . [ Worms screeching ] [ Grunts ] Haisal ! [ Worms screeching ] [ Screaming ] Goddamn , go ! Go ! Dog ! Goddamn dog ! [ Grunts ] You don 't choose ! You don 't do that ! You don 't play God ! - That 's not your right ! - Look around . You see God anywhere ? Tonight , we are God . AIKEN : He was right , but we didn 't know it . In that moment , on that rock , with the devil on our heels , we were gods . Gods of the damned . We 'll keep him in line . Promise you that . I 'm sure that 's your plan , not that is possible now , since we 're falling apart . We work together it won 't . ONI looks out for ONI . You know it and I know it . I thought you said no proper nouns tonight . People get scared , they get tribal . Trust their own before the other . We 're the other tonight . Don 't pretend we 're not . Sounds like a man drawing lines . Just to find a reason to turn on us . Shouldn 't fear me . I 'm just one man . And the glorified bus driver as backup . One man that was a Spartan . You 're playing scared , Commander . See , I already died . That 's the difference between you and me . Gave my life away when I was signed up to be a soldier . It 's a matter of what I will give it away for now . The noble soldier . I forgot . We die here , we go to Valhalla , right ? They don 't allow ONI into Valhalla . I 'll tell you what . You got a death wish with what happened to you . That 's fine . But I still got some fight . Not going gently into this night . Not yet . Not to the Hunter Worms , not to you , not to the sun . You 'd have it that they 'd go first then . No , never . That 's my team . I love them . 'Cause that 's what is gonna take for you to survive . You know that , don 't you ? It 's you , or them . You love them ? You love them and all ? It 's not even a choice . AIKEN : We got part of it . We 're close . Let 's spread out and try to find a way down . I hate that had to happen to him . Carried us here though . Giving us chance to live . You and me . You do know , they 've been looking around this whole time . Choosing . We all have . Choosing what ? The other one who will live . Besides themselves . 'Cause you know that everyone 's got themselves pencilled in for one of those seats . I looked around . And I chose you . - Don 't do this . - We don 't have time . It 's time to choose . Part of the soldiering , part of being ONI is living to fight another day . We don 't make a dent in the Covenant if we 're dead . And them ? We 've lost soldiers before . But we didn 't abandon them . Just tell me when we draw those straws you have my back , that you 'll get me off this rock . Straws will decide . For everyone . Even me . That 's not good enough . I need to know where you stand . I save you , I kill them . That 's not a choice I wanna make . Then people are gonna start to make choices . You realize that , don 't you ? ESTRIN : Come on , man . Help me out here . When are you coming back , daddy ? I heard you 're gonna come home . I made a picture of ... The hell are you doing ? Turn that off ! You touch them , I 'll kill you . Turn it off ! Ramos , I 'm gonna tell you this once . Your kids are beautiful , but tonight they 're gonna get us killed . Now let 's find us a way down . Thought we were already in the ninth circle of hell . Looks like there 's a bonus level . - No one of them has got kids . - Shh ! They die out here , just them died . Me , I go , kids will have nothing . - No one there ... - Shut up ! Stay on mission . It 's always the mission , isn 't it ? Draw straws like a good soldier . You could bet straws isn 't gonna decide anything . A gun will . You and I decide it 'll be by guns , it 'll be by guns . Me and you ? Which one of us is gonna fly the tug ? We need a pilot in one of those seats . The girl maybe . The heat kills her , - the smuggler . - That only leaves one other seat . We take out the rest , and you and I , we draw straws . Leaves a fifty-fifty change instead of one in seven . You 're out of your mind . I 'm the only one seeing things straight . You 're wrong . Shut up ! Don 't go talk to them . And I told you the things . And I trusted you . Help me ! Ramos , help me up ! Come on , man , help me up ! Come on , lift me up . [ Worms screeching ] [ Screaming ] [ Worms screeching ] Still kids . You understand , right ? What 's going on ? Talk to me ! He fell . He huh ... He fell . It 's over , forget it . The important thing is you still have that gun . We 're close . The bottoms are not so far from here . We better top up up here . We do it down there and they come , we 're trapped . Same as last time . Saturate as quickly as possible . Not gonna happen , friend . - We don 't have time for this . - We don 't have enough to share anymore . If we 're gonna get back to that tug , we need air . All of it . That 's not up for you to decide . I told you choices are gonna start being made . No straws . This mission is over . We are now going back to the tug . You wanna kill me , go ahead , but she gets oxygen . Don 't move ! Stop this , goddammit ! I will power up and gun you down , I swear to God . Put it down ! You will not do this . We will not go out like this . You drawing on me ? I chose you . I chose you . Drop it . I swear to God , drop it or I 'll ... Or you 're what ? We can power up if you want . And shoot it out . But you 'll lose . Power up and you 'll kill all of us . Including yourselves . You never know . I can power up . Put a couple of rounds in you . Power down . Maybe the Hunters are not that wise . You 'd take that chance ? Everything 's chances now . You got one more second Locke . RAMOS : Come on , man . Doesn 't have to be like this . As we planned . [ Groans ] I tried to save you . I 'm not the one who needs saving . Said the dead man . Anyone who wants to go after them . They can . Know where I stand . I wouldn 't make it to 200 yards . Might be all you have to make , Macer . LOCKE : We can 't leave the deposits intact . We came all this way . And at least one of us isn 't getting off this rock anyhow . I called this mission . It 's on me . Fuel cells functioning . It 's a go . The least essential one always dies . Me ? He needs to fly the ship . You ? What 's he needs ? Never did draw those straws , did we ? I gotta top up . We don 't have time for this ! [ Beeping ] Don 't do it ! See you in Valhalla . We got a problem . [ Screaming ]

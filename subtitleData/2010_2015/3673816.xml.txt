 God . Come quick ! It 's your sister Annabelle ! No way . I want to come home . Taking Annabelle - - That was never part of the deal . You asked me to give you data , to tell you when we were running the experiment . That 's all . The deal is whatever we say it is . Annabelle is just insurance . What 's that on his hand ? That looks like a ring . A quantum entanglement device . I 'm Gabriel McDow . I told you that . I said--I definitely said that already . You have to remember things , Olivia . Gabriel , why have you been following me ? You 're going the wrong way . The futures I saw , you 're always with Lloyd . You all know Fiona banks , mi6 . None of them had visions , and now they 're all dead . " The blue hand . No limits . No fear . " A death club ? Slingerland . Am I saying that right ? It says here you taught American history at South Fairfax high . The script for this conversation has already been written . Whatever you 've all seen is gonna happen . Now Celia 's death was an accident , okay ? It could 've happened to anyone . Al ! What I saw doesn 't have to play out that way . I found a way to change the game . Al ! You do realize you 're wearing the same jacket you were wearing when we broke ground on the accelerator . It was an accident , I suppose . There are no accidents , Lloyd . I detect some sublimated sentiment bubbling to the surface . This is a big deal for both of us . We 've been working on tachyons for 12 years . This is our moment , Simon . Go with it . Cheers . Cheers . God , I hope it all works . We 're simulating the big bang . What could go wrong ? Excuse me . Sure . It 's mum . Hello . What ? When ? Okay . Uh ... Is Annabelle all right ? Just , uh , just tell her I 'll be on the first flight home . Yeah . Okay , you , too . Bye . Uh ... My dad died . Activation in one minute . All right . This experience was designed by Dr. Campos , who , unfortunately , could not be with us on this day when we recreate the beginning of the universe . Lloyd Simcoe , Dr. Campos ' mentor , the brain behind the brain- - this is Angie Tremont from the " new science report . " A journalist ? It 's all right . She 's been cleared . Oh , sorry . We have a rather strict confidentiality protocol , so we 're a little wary of the press . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Dr. Simcoe . Yes . Dr. Myhill 's been telling me all about the project . Your crowning glory . Well , it 's been a team effort . Uh , Gordon , the preliminary firings have started . The big moment . Yes ? They 're ready . Activation commencing in 30 seconds . Initiate . Here goes nothing . Or everything . Activation commencing in 20 seconds . Activation commencing in 10 seconds ... 9,8 , 7,6 , 5,4 , 3,2 , 1 . Hey , honey . Go ahead . It 's your home , too . I 'll always find you , kiddo . The visions people had are really only just possible futures . Uh , the universe operates within certain parameters , but there is some flexibility . With one week till the 29th , Dr. Simcoe , we are all still wondering what to expect . Well , it 's a well-known precept in quantum physics that observations shape reality . You 're saying that seeing our futures may , in fact , change our futures . Uh , that 's the theory , yes . But the future does have a way of fighting back . What do you mean by that ? Small things may change , but the forces of the universe may be pushing us towards the futures we have seen . That 's interesting . And what about the people who learned from mosaic they were meant to die before the 29th but lived past the fatal event ? Well , those people are the statistical anomalies at the edge of the curve . Should you still be worried ? Because it sounds like you 're saying the universe may course-correct , that they might not have escaped their fates after all . Yes , that 's possible . So maybe a better word for " course-correction " destiny " ? Well , I 'm just a scientist , I 'm not really qualified to answer that question . I 'd like to welcome tonight 's next guest- - Celia Quinones . Ms. Quinones is the young woman whose future was changed by the suicide of FBI Agent Al Gough- - one of Dr. Simcoe 's " statistical anomalies . " Ms. Quinones , take us through your experience . First , I-I would like to say again to the family of Agent Gough how ... grateful my family and I are for his actions . Um , in the first weeks after the blackout , I heard that not having a vision meant that I would be dead on April 29th . That must 've been terrifying for you . When I discovered on the mosaic Web site that I would be hit by a car , I lived in constant terror that I might die at any moment . But you didn 't . I 'm sure a lot of people have questions , so let 's open up the phone lines . Uh , Muncie , Indiana , you 're on the air . This question 's for Dr. Simcoe . Is it possible the blackout caused permanent brain damage to anyone ? There 's no reason to believe so . Well , people 's lives have been ruined . What if this happens again ? It is critical that people remain calm . A-and--and I-I must repeat that no one 's brain was damaged in any way by the blackout itself . And let me reassure you it is impossible that there could be another blackout . I almost believe him myself . Yeah , tell me again why we 're not telling people there 's another blackout coming ? Because we don 't know when it 's gonna happen . We tell people but don 't say when ? The world will turn into an armed camp . So , Celia , you 're confident that your future has changed ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . Thank you for joining us today . Any last words , Dr. Simcoe ? Uh , come the 29th , I believe that we will end up where we 're supposed to be . " Supposed to be " ? Thank you for speaking with us today . That doesn 't mean we can 't decide our fate . After the break , we 'll be talking to ... Author of the award-winning book " teens and truth . " She 's going to help us figure how to talk about ... Stop ! Stop ! That 's my sister ! Annabelle ! Annabelle ! Stop there ! Annabelle ! Stop , Simon ! Don 't come any closer or they 'll kill me ! Who ? What ? They 're watching . They 'll shoot me . What ? Who ? What do they want ? They said they want you and the ring . They got your message , and they 're sending one back . You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . Annabelle . Please , Simon . Give them what they want . They were very specific . You only have 12 hours to give them the ring or they will kill me . Get in the car . Just go . Annabelle , I 'm not leaving you here . Get in the car . Annabelle ... just go ! Please , just go ! Let 's go . Now . Zampieron ? Tech wizard extraordinaire ? I 'll take that as a " yes . " License plate ? You are good . What I 'd like to know is whose car that belongs to . Yeah . Yeah , I can definitely do this . Simple . Just gotta run it by the head man . That 's the part of the process I 'd like you to omit . Hmm . No can do . Name your price . Anything ? Hey , you . Hey . How do you always know when I 'm here ? Mm , stalking . Internet . Paid informants . You know , the usual . Mm-hmm . I , um , I brought you a book . It 's one of my favorites , and it helped me a lot with my mom . I wish ... I wish you 'd tell me when you 're getting chemo . I don 't want you to feel obligated to come . It 's not an obligation . L.A.P.D. Called . Someone claiming to be MI6 used my name to get access to a crime scene . Hello , Demetri . You 're looking well . You , too , Fiona . So , uh , I 'm guessing you didn 't fly all the way in from London just ' cause you missed me . No . Andrew weeks was supposed to die on march the 2nd from a drug allergy , but he survived the date . He made a big deal out of it , too , huh ? His wife heard him fall , came running out and found him dead . No sign of anyone coming in or out the house . If I 'm living on borrowed time , I might avoid a room full of guns . Except he wasn 't shot . He was bleeding from the mouth and nose , so forensics field-tested his coffee . It showed positive for warfarin . Rat poison ? That explains the bleeding . I don 't get it . You got a room full of guns , and you poison a guy . Why ? Weeks was supposed to die from a drug allergy , not a gunshot wound . I think the killer was trying to get as close as possible to the original cause of death . That was in his papers . These are directions to a blue hand gathering . That 's why I 'm her four blue handers dead in the L.A. area in the last three weeks . Each knew exactly how and when they were supposed to die but lived past their death date . I was in Anaheim investigating when I got word of this one . You really think someone 's to trying knock off survivors ? It 's just a hunch . What was I supposed to say ? " Well , yes , there 's gonna be another blackout . Well , sorry , we just can 't tell you when . " So you said what you had to . I mean , people are terrified . You gave ' em hope . No , at I gave them was a lie . What would give people hope is if Simon and I could crack this q . E.D. Technology . Then at least people wouldn 't black out in the first place . What about that caller who asked about brain damage ? I mean , I 've never even considered that . No . If the blackout could cause brain damage , we would 've picked up on it a long time ago . I know how much this is weighing on you . I wish there was something I could do to help . Olivia ... You already are . Hey . You wanted to see me ? You may think that promising a junior analyst a weekend at the bunny ranch will get him to jeopardize his job , but it won 't . My sister ran away from home I saw her this morning . She was in a white van with that license plate . So you just figured you 'd have one of my agents help you out ? I have to find her . We ran the plate . Van was stolen two days ago in San Francisco . Traffic Cam ... Picked this up . Now that 's a nice story , Simon , but how about the truth ? You wanna tell me what the hell 's going on ? I was trying to have her come with me . The people she 's with , they have some sort of ... hold over her . You 're lying . She didn 't run away . She was kidnapped . Look at her body language . She 's terrified . How long have you known about this ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , come on . Don 't play games with me . This is your sister . Exactly . My sister . That 's why I 'll do anything to find her . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Someone knows you feel this way , they 'll use it against you as leverage . And considering what you know , I 'd say they could get a lot . Are you suggesting I 've been compromised ? I don 't know what you 've been , but I do know one thing - you 've been lying . And now you 've put the entire mosaic investigation in Jeopardy . What do you think ? Something in the ring 's structure has to be maintaining superposition . It 's keeping people awake - but how ? You 're not even listening . " Maintaining superposition " was what you said , and I have no idea . We , do you want to focus a little ? We 've done enough damage . Maybe we can put something right . Look , just because you feel guilty about lying on the news and want to save the world doesn 't mean that we can actually make it happen . Yes , we can , and it 's not about feeling guilty . Yeah , right . No , it 's about preventing more deaths . Oh , it 's all Lloyd Simcoe 's fault , and now he can save the day . It 's a little messianic , don 't you think ? What are you talking about ? Oh , millions of deaths . It 's an overwhelming concept . Numbers like that- - you lose track of individuals . They fall through the cracks . A single person doesn 't even matter . Okay , now you 're losing me . My sister . Annabelle ? So what are you talking about ? She 's been kidnapped . When ? A few days after the blackout . Why would anyone kidnap your sister ? I have no idea . What do the police say ? Well , the FBI are on it . There 's nothing more I can do . Well , why didn 't you tell me ? I would 've helped . Oh , yeah ? How ? W-well , I don 't know , but I-I- - now I just feel useless . Well it 's not about you , Lloyd . I had to deal with the situation as best I could for Annabelle . Now I 'm sorry I didn 't keep you in the loop . I 've been kinda busy . Why would he hide the fact that his sister was kidnapped ? The polygraph 's inconclusive . You really think he 's compromised ? There 's nothing concrete , but ... Look , mark , I don 't like this situation any more than you do , but we need Simon . We 'll look for his sister . Find her , and find out what they want from him . I never thought we 'd be talking to this guy again . Everyone , next week 's reading ... Schopenhauer . Mr. Slingerland ? Agent Noh . I 'm so glad to see you again . This is inspector banks . I remember you , too . Mr. Slingerland . What 's going on ? Do you recognize this man ? Yeah , that 's Andrew . Andy weeks . I remember seeing him at the blue hand gatherings . That was a while ago . I 'm not really into that anymore . Why do you ask ? He 's dead . How ? Murdered . Ooh . Poor Andy . Uh ... Guess he thought he was in the clear . But I suppose the universe has to , uh , balance itself . Excuse me ? But I suppose the universe life is energy , you see.F. As each new life begins , another ends . And if you mess with that balance , the universe pushes back . Andy was a good guy . I 'm sorry . We need you to put together a list of the blue handers who knew Mr. weeks . Can you do that for us ? Be happy to . And you might want to be careful . We think someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates- - people like you . So you don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? Just watch you back , is what we 're saying . I will , agent Noh . Gabriel 's blood work came back . So besides his feet , everything seems okay . The left foot looks good . His right still looks pretty bad . Okay , well , let 's finish up the antibiotics , and we 'll reevaluate tomorrow . Okay . Orderlies to admitting . Where 's Charlie ? Hey , you ! Charlie 's at school . What are you doing here ? Uh , occupational therapy , which I completely forgot about . Dylan was hoping to see you , and , um , so was I. Hi . Hi . Lloyd ? Lloyd Simcoe ? Lloyd ? I knew it . I knew it . I said it would happen . I saw it would happen . I-I knew it . You 're supposed to be with Olivia . Beg your pardon ? She 's not supposed to be with the other one . Okay , Gabriel , let 's go . Come on . Back--back to bed . Let 's go . Not the other one . I need my shoes . Remember ? Your shoes didn 't fit . That 's why your feet were bleeding . But I liked those shoes . I know . We 'll get you some more shoes . We will . Let 's go . ? Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree ? Yeah , okay . I 'll explain later . Let 's go . ? Sitting in a tree , tree ? Okay . Let 's go , Gabriel . Inside . Gabe , we 're gonna do this . Come on . Let 's go . So good . So good that you 're together with Lloyd now . No , we 're not together . You 're together with Lloyd now . It 's so good . You know what ? We 're not - we 're not together , Gabe . We 're just--yeah , complicated . We 're--we 're ... You 're the best thing since sliced bread . Yes ? Okay . You 're--you 're the best thing since sliced bread . In you go . Can I come in ? Brought lunch . Hi , Gabriel . Where 's the beef ? I got it right here . Go ahead . So how 's he doing ? Uh , he 's better . Good . We got a lot of questions , and I 'm gonna have to bring him into the FBI . You know what ? He hasn 't finished his I.V. Antibiotics . He needs a brain scan . He 's not going anywhere for a couple of days . Would it be all right if I just ask him a few questions here , then ? Sure . Thank you . Hey , buddy . Can I ask you a question ? I found this in your things . You wanna tell me what this is ? My book . It 's all there . But what is this a picture of ? Gabriel , this is important . I saw it . I was there , on a trip . I saw it . A flash-forward . Oh , no . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! I don 't like pickles ! Okay , it 's okay . I don 't like pickles ! I-I don 't like lettuce ! I-I hate onions ! I ... I like tomatoes . I like--I like tomatoes . Now where are we ? Starting from where we first pick up the van Campos ' sister was in - 6th street bridge . Then we headed South . We picked them up here , and then here , and then they head into this weird zone downtown . Eight blocks wide . Coverage their is sketchy , so we lost them . You can 't get me any more than that ? I 'm not a magician . Any way we can pick up the van coming out of that zone ? Well , there are over a hundred exits . It 'd take at least a day and a half to go through all that footage . Well , it 's only eight blocks . We can do a sweep in less time than whiz kid here . Mm . You found something . Just following up on a tip . I 'm coming with you . No , you 're not . Yes , I am . No , you 're not ! Listen to me , Simon . You 're here for one reason and one reason only- - to work on the q.E.D. Your volunteering here is starting to feel a little convenient . I don 't trust you , Simon . Not for a minute . That 's your prerogative . You 're damn right it is , and that 's not gonna work out too well for you . Right now I 'm gonna go get your sister back . And after I do , you and I are gonna have a little sit-down . No more lying . They said want you and the ring . They got your message , and they 're sending one back . You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . Annabelle . Please , Simon . Give them what they want . Thanks for coming by . I wanted to go over your latest serologies with you . Your tumor markers are undetectable . Lymphocytes are back to normal . Wait . Does that mean that I 'm- - experimental protocol seems to be working . Your cancer is officially in remission . What ? What ? What ? We 've been optimistic for a few weeks . I just didn 't want to get your hopes up . I 've had two other oncologists check those results , and it 's working . That 's incredible . Well , what are you waiting for ? Go on . Get out of here . The future awaits . Yeah . You wanted to see me ? Oh . Yeah . Um , we have a shift down at immigration tonight giving flu shots to detainees . Can you help out ? Sure . Happy to . Okay , great . Just take a look through these files and see what you 're getting yourself into . Don 't worry . It 's all basic . Nothing you can 't handle . Okay ? Thank you . Have you been working all day ? 00 in the morning . Do you know this man ? Someone tampered with his coffee . Yeah . Andy . You 're sure ? Yeah , he 's a regular . He 's here every day . So am I. When 's the last time you saw him ? Uh , yesterday . He was here with some guy , chatting away like they were old pals . Made a big deal about surviving something , his whole life to look forward to . What 'd his friend look like ? I don 't know . Tall , kinda geeky-looking , wearing this big , ugly horseshoe ring . Life is energy , you see . As each new life begins , another ends . And if you mess with that balance , the universe ... you 're sure ? Yeah , I am . Pushes back . " You can do what you will , " but at any given moment of your life , " you can will only one definite thing . Nothing other than that thing . " What do you guys think that means ? That free will is a lie ? Exactly . Where 's Mr. Slingerland ? I don 't know . He was here , and then he just left . Are you Agent Noh ? He wanted me to tell you something . What ? The universe always pushes back . You might want to be careful . We think someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates . So you don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . He 's trying to course-correct . I think I know who he 's going after next . Celia Quinones , welcome to your future . Run ! Celia , run ! Run ! Now ! Celia , now ! Run ! South on grand ! He 's heading South on grand ! Freeze ! FBI ! Aah ! Uhh ! Oh , my God ! No ! Celia ! Someone get help ! She just ran in front of me ! I couldn 't stop ! She 's still alive . She 's still alive . E.M.T.S to grand and 6th priority 3 ! Code 1 ! Move ! She was just there , Demetri . She 's all right . Stay with her ! She 's not dead . She 's alive . You failed . Not yet . Anyway ... It 's not me . It 's the universe , which never fails . It 's funny . I was supposed to have an aneurysm , but you killed me instead . Gets done either way . See you soon ... sport . Simon . Here to make up for my bad behavior . Don 't worry about it . You 've been under a lot of stress lately . I just wanted to say thanks . For what ? Cambridge , the Brewschlagger fellowship , for getting me into n.L.A.P. I did it for selfish reasons , Simon . You make me look good . Gracious as well . You helped me out and you know it . I wouldn 't be anywhere without you . Okay , what 's going on ? I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about Annabelle . Truly , I am . I should 've , months ago . It 's been eating away at me , I should have said something . Well , I 'm--I 'm sorry I couldn 't help . I would have , you know . Yeah , I know you would . You 're the only real friend I have . You are clearly in need of a drink . Come on . Oh , you 're not wrong , but I , uh ... I have to be somewhere . I 'll see you , Lloyd . Hey . Hey ! Nicole . I 've been looking all over for you . What 's the matter ? I , um ... I , uh ... I have something I have to tell you . Yeah . Me too . Okay ... then . You 're never gonna believe this . My cancer is in remission . I know ! Oh , my God ! Bryce , that 's- - that 's amazing ! I 'm still completely in shock , and it--it got me thinking about my future , and I don 't want to waste any more time . Are you sure ? I mean , what we saw is- - no , forget what we saw . We 're here , now . This is all that matters . What happened to Celia ... There was nothing we could do . You know , I 've been thinking about our bird . What if you tape the window ? How do you mean ? Well , if you cover the window , the bird might not crash into it . It 's a nice thought . But I think it 'll probably just crash into a different window . Maybe . But it 's worth a shot . It 's the hospital calling . Hello ? Agent banks ? Agent Fiona banks ? Yes . I 'm calling about Celia Quinones and I 'm afraid it 's bad news . Her physical and neurological injuries are extensive , and I 'm not optimistic about her chance of survival . Oh , my God . You 're gonna call again on the 29th to tell me that she 's gone . Ms. banks , what happened to Celia was an accident . There are no accidents anymore . Mark , we 're running out of time for Campos ' sister . I 've covered a 5-block radius . Only 3 to go . Whoa . I 'm sorry . Special Agent Benford . FBI . Looks like they got you working late . Yeah . Some clown ran right into this , nearly took out the electrical box . Pulled into that warehouse driving crazy . That 's a lot of damage . Eh . Imagine what the van looked like . Imagine . I think I found the van . Put me through to s.W.A.T. Okay , move ! Now go ! Move . It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're safe now . I 'm here . Yes ? It 's mark . We got her , Simon . She 's sitting right next to me . Thank God . Is she all right ? Exhausted , confused , but physically she 's fine . Can I talk to her for a second ? I just wanna hear her voice . All right , but then you and I need to talk , and you need to tell me everything . No more lies , Simon . Fine . He wants to talk to you . Simon ? Belle . Is that really you ? I 'm really tired , Simon . I wanna go home and see mom . I know . I just wanted to make sure you were safe . No matter what happens , baby sister , remember ... I love you . I love you , too . Good-bye , belle . Simon . Good-bye , mark . He took the damn ring . Uh , what am I looking at ? So this is Gabriel McDows brain . No brain damage . And he had hundreds of flash-forwards . Now these are taken from people who were being scanned at the time of the blackout on October 6th . Same thing . No damage . Nothing . Nothing unusual . So you weren 't lying about this in your interview . Thanks . Makes me feel a bit better . Good . Well , so this McDow is a savant ? Yeah . He 's pretty high-functioning . Incredible memory . And he thinks we should be together . Uh ... That 's what he saw in his flash-forwards . Were we happy ? I know how I felt in mine . I need to talk to you . I was just leaving . Thanks for the scans , Olivia . I really appreciate it . Yeah , sure . Excuse me . See you later . Bye , mark . I 'll call you . Simon Campos has disappeared . What ? He 's gone . He came to see me tonight . It was the strangest thing . It was like he was trying to say good-bye . The day of the blackout - anything about his behavior seem ... strange ? Well , I don 't know . He was in Toronto at his father 's funeral . Uh ... My dad died . My God , Simon . What happened ? There was an accident . I have to go home . Yes , of course . Then we 'll postpone until you get back . No . Stick to the plan . But the system 's still on standby . What difference does a week make ? What 's the rush ? No , we 've worked too long , too hard at this . We have to stay on schedule . It has to be October 6th , 11 : 00 A.M. No delays . You know , I never understood why he would miss that moment- - I mean , after all those years of work , and we could 've changed the date . Is Simon Campos capable of engineering a global blackout ? He 's capable of anything . And he always has a plan . Once we realized that his involvement in the blackout was deeper than we thought , I went back and I ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on suspect zero . Not only are they comparable in height , weight and age , they 're a 99th percentile match in spacial-temporal and kinematic classes . But suspect zero was in Detroit , and we have multiple eyewitnesses that put Simon at his father 's funeral in Toronto the same day . I checked inbound flights to airports around Detroit . On October 6th , a g4 with Canadian tail numbers requested an emergency maintenance landing at willow run . So they wouldn 't have filed a flight plan . Plane was on the ground for a couple of hours then right back to Toronto . He could 've gotten to the stadium then back to the airport by then . Show me that footage again . Simon Campos is suspect zero . If I showed you pictures , Annabelle , could you identify any of these guys ? We need to find the men who took you . No . I never saw any faces . They always wore these weird masks . Please , can I go home now ? I know you 're tired . Just one more question . What did they want from Simon ? I told you . I don 't know . They just left me in the van . They said they were done with me . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? Annabelle . What did they want him for ? I promise you . Nothing bad will happen to Simon . Think real hard . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? They said he 's going to cause another blackout . Sync by NoFate

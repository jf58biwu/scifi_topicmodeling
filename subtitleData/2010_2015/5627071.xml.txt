 Stephen : My name is Stephen Jameson . I am one of The Tomorrow People , The next step in human evolution . They call our powers the three T 's . Telepathy ... Cara : Stephen ? Stephen : Telekinesis ... And teleportation . There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra ... No ! The secret organization that hunts us . The only way to keep my species from going extinct Is to find my father . And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy . Cara : Previously on The Tomorrow People ... Reading someone 's thoughts is just the beginning . You 'll be able to access their feelings . Even their memories . Stephen , you have no idea what you 're getting yourself into . Marla : We have a visitor . This is your uncle . Work for me , Stephen . We track anything that can indicate a new breakout And then we have our agents who help us track rogue paranormals . And when the time comes , Stephen will lead us to The Tomorrow People . And we 'll kill them . Stephen . Got someone I 'd like you to meet . Your new partner . [ pop music playing ] [ laughing ] [ indistinct conversation ] Whoa , whoa , whoa ... Dude , go for it . That girl literally doesn 't say no . Why don 't you make a move ? I 'm just looking out for my wingman . [ sound fades out ] [ heart beating ] [ inaudible ] [ inaudible ] You can read lips , right ? Good . Well , let me tell you , You 're not missing anything . The music here sucks . [ chuckles ] You wanna get out of here ? Go someplace a little more quiet ? [ pop music continues playing ] [ chuckles ] You 're really pretty . How do you say , uh , " pretty " in sign language ? [ gasps ] Hey , hey ! Easy . Heard about you from the guys . Ow ! Ah ! Deaf bitch ... Get over here ! [ gasps ] [ cloth tearing ] [ straining ] [ tearing ] Hey ! Cara ! [ panting ] [ shrieking ] [ grunts ] [ sound fades out ] [ screaming ] [ screaming ] [ crickets chirping ] [ owl hooting ] [ high-pitched whining ] Excuse me . Are you done with that ? Your newspaper . Man 1 : Way to go , dude . You just creeped her out . Man 2 : How do I tell her I didn 't get the promotion ? I was so sure . We were so sure . Man 3 : I 'm so tired . I 'm so , so tired . [ telepathic whispering continues ] John : Hey , just in time . We figured out a way to get the jump on Ultra . A way to save breakouts before their powers are stripped Or they 're turned into agents . Yes . We are using Ultra 's own intel against them . [ laughs ] My buddy Tim figured it out . And who built Tim ? Who stole his new processor ? Good combo . Up top ? Are you okay ? I thought you ... You were gonna get us food . Sorry , I , uh ... I got sidetracked . What 's the plan ? We 're going to need Stephen . [ dance music playing ] Uh , I don 't think I should drink with ... Your meds . Yeah , I know . It 's just water . It 's a prop . You gotta blend . I 'm blending , okay ? Check it out ... Oh ... No , no , no , please . Don 't ever do that again . [ Laughing ] I , uh , I 'm actually trying to reintegrate you into the social circle , Not have you scare people away . I know , okay ? I get it , but I don 't need you to babysit me . Good . Young man : She 's not wearing a bra . No wait , she is wearing a bra . She 's not wearing a bra . Oh , I can 't tell . Young woman 1 : Twenty calories a chip . Salsa 's another 20 , but I skipped lunch , so ... Really good . Young woman 2 : Douche ... Douche ... Bitch . Sartre was right . Hell is other people . What 's your problem ? [ laughs ] nothing , um ... Emily . Stephen ... Jameson , I remember . The crazy one . Hey , you know , we should probably split up Before the normal kids think the freaks are starting a club . What is her problem ? Claws in . Emily 's been through hell . Yeah , so have you . Okay , I get what happened with her sister was awful , But doesn 't mean she gets a free pass . Maybe that 's enough socialization for one night . Okay , sure . I 'll meet you outside . Just let me go say bye . Emily : I 'm so sick and tired of trying to fit in with these people . Thank the non-existent god that in 48 hours I 'll be dead . Jedikiah : We certainly had a difficult time tracking you down . Question is , what are we going to do with you now ? Who are you and what is this place ? It 's kind of a rehab center for people like you . Look , I 'm not saying that superpowers aren 't fun . Heck , if I was born with them , I 'd probably decorate my walls with stolen Van Goghs as well . [ laughs incredulously ] Of course , I prefer modernism . Point is ... Your kind can 't be trusted in our world . This ... This is about the paintings . Look , I will never teleport into the met ever again And I will never touch another painting , okay ? I know you won 't . [ injector clicks ] You gonna kill me ? Well , that 's entirely up to you . First part is non-negotiable . Your criminal disposition , your mediocre powers , are useless to me . So I 'm going to take them away from you . Return you to the way you used to be . Human . And the second part ? That you will never breathe a word of what happens today to anyone , Or , make no mistake , I will kill you . You believe me ? Give him the shot . Hey , hey , wait , no . Ow ! [ groaning ] [ screaming ] John : Have you ever seen someone have their powers taken ? I have . What do you want me to do ? You said you wanted to be a double agent . [ Door opens ] It 's game time , baby . Tim , pull up the schematics . Tim : Yes , Cara . I 've constructed a 3D map of Ultra . You want me to break into my own office ? A highly restricted part of the facility . We 'll guide you through it , step by step . And I 'll be close enough to be inside your head the whole time . And theirs . You 'll place this drive ... This dongle . Inside their firewall . It 'll install software that syncs up their system directly to Tim . It 'll give us all their intel on new breakouts . Ultra is linked into a whole web of classified material . Medical files , police reports , psych records . They even have their own algorithms for id-ing potential paranormals . It 's sort of like an alarm system that lets them know If someone 's secretly one of us . Tap into that system , no more head start for Jedikiah . Are you excited , timothy ? You get to stick your dongle in Ultra 's mainframe . Tim : As you know , I 'm incapable of experiencing excitement . Or appreciating crude sexual innuendo . If you get caught , it won 't matter that you 're Jedikiah 's nephew . But , hey , if you 're not ready ... I 'm ready . Cara . You got a sec ? At this party , it was the first time That I could hear all of my classmate 's thoughts . Sucks , doesn 't it ? Knowing what 's going on inside people 's heads . Yeah , but ... Not just that , there 's this girl , Emily . She said something disturbing . What 'd you hear ? " In 48 hours , I 'll be dead . " That could mean anything . Or it could mean , in two days , she 's gonna kill herself . Even if it did , We don 't use our powers to intervene in human lives . Why not ? Do you really want to play god ? It 's messy , it 's complicated and it risks exposure . When I was losing it , I had to go to the nurse every day to get my pills . Me and Emily , we were the freaks , Both of us having breakdowns . Only she had an excuse . She was behind the wheel of the car When her sister got ... Stephen , stop it . You dig around in people 's minds , You 'll find everyone has a sad story . You talking from experience ? Not that I 'd like to share . Okay , wait ... So what ? We just ignore them ? Forget about their kind . We 'll be lucky if we can save our own species . Take off your shirt . Excuse me ? Bio-metric transmitter . It only works on bare skin . [ chuckles ] Okay . You could buy me dinner first , I don 't even know your name . Yes you do , it 's agent Nichols . Got a first name , agent Nichols ? This isn 't some get-to-know-you luncheon . I 'm here to train you . It 's Darcy . What the hell 's the gun for , Darcy ? According to your file , not only are you naturally gifted In telepathy , teleportation , telekinesis , But you can actually stop time . I don 't know how to control it . Oh , I saw the tape . You did it before . Yeah , by accident . Your power is tied into your emotion . The stronger your emotion , the stronger your power . Which is why you were able to save those kids . Because you were scared . Which only follows that , if I scare you again , You 'll be able to stop time . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... Wait , wait , wait ... Are you serious ? Two ... I swear to god . Three . [ shouts ] What just happened ? [ system whirring ] [ beeping ] Nothing , except for an incredibly elevated heart rate . You just fired a gun at me . Why aren 't I dead ? Oh . It was loaded with blanks . Our kind can 't kill , remember ? I just had to make you think it was real . [ chuckles ] [ panting ] well , this was ... Loads of fun . I 'm gonna go grab a water . Maybe change my shorts . You do that . Cara : Your partner 's a real sweetheart . Stephen : [ chuckles ] you were in my head for that ? Cara : And hers . Being a telepath , is like being a psychic antenna . That 's why I had to get close enough to help you , It helps me hear better . See that age ? Follow him . He 's headed to the restricted section . Stephen : Uh , problem . There 's a key pad . [ pulsating ] Two , two ... Six , zero , one . [ beeping ] [ clicking ] Stephen : Now which way to the mainframe ? Left . Go all the way to the end of the ... Cara : Wait ! Someone headed your way . Hide . You 're all clear . Go . Okay , stop . You 're there . Stephen : I don 't see a mainframe . [ beeping ] Cara : Above you . You see that pan ? Third one up . Can you reach it ? It 's the primary data cable for the mainframe . [ pulsating ] Waiter : Damn European tippers . Man : I can 't believe I blew it with another interview . [ overlapping telepathic whispering ] Stephen : Okay , that was easy . Which way out ? Am I clear ? [ whispering continues ] Cara , are you there ? [ panting ] [ high-pitched whining ] [ sighs ] Stephen . What are you doing here ? Uh ... I ... I was looking for you . I wanted to talk to you in private . Come to my office . Stephen : I overheard something that I wasn 't supposed to . One of my classmates , who 's been having Pretty serious mental problems , is thinking about killing herself . So ... So I should try to help her ? What was it that Stalin once said ? When one man dies it 's a tragedy , When millions die , it 's a statistic . Well , obviously he was a monster . And he had it backwards . Because what happens if by using your powers to help this person , You accidentally reveal to the rest of the world That there 's a new species living amongst them ? One that could read their thoughts , Steal their secrets , prey upon them . Humans would either try to exploit you or kill you And then millions would die , of your kind and mine . And that would indeed be a tragedy . So what does make Emily ? Is she the statistic ? You can 't save everybody . Sweep the fourth floor . Make sure nothing is out of place . [ Russell exclaims ] The great Dongler returns ! Good job . Tim 's uploading from Ultra as we speak . Are you sure you got out clean ? Yeah , yeah . Cara was with me every step of the way . Thank you for not making a big deal in front of ... Actually , it was a big deal . I almost got caught up there Because of you going mute on me in the middle of a mission . What happened ? Sometimes my powers work a little too well up there . I can get overwhelmed by all the noise and I get these ... Episodes . Episodes ? Must be tough . What ? Being stuck down here . There 's a whole world up there you can 't be a part of . Trust me , Stephen . I 'm happy not being a part of that world . [ phone ringing ] [ officers speaking indistinctly ] Cara ? Are you okay ? What happened , honey ? Who ? Who did this to you ? Officer : Mr. Coburn ? Tell her she 's under arrest . For what ? For the murder of Tyler Miller . Murder ? [ stammering ] my daughter says she just shoved him . She was defending herself . Yeah , well , it was some shove . The kid 's head was cracked open . What did you hit him with , a rock ? Where did you hide it ? The truth is going to come out . Don 't waste ... Can I have a moment alone with my daughter , please ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry . It 's gonna be okay . Sir , you wanna help your daughter ? I suggest you find her an attorney . Emily : 4-15 , then 5-44 , 7-23 , 9-16 ... So you 're , uh ... You 're stalking Emily now ? [ chuckles ] no . Liar . What are you up to ? Nothing . I 'm just worried about her . I think she 's been more depressed than usual . Oh , and this is based on the , uh , The 10 seconds of scintillating conversation You eeked out of her at the party . Not just that . I , um ... I overhead her at the guidance counselor talking about The accident and her sister . That 's not cool . I know , but I heard what I heard . She 's in a dark place and I 'm worried she might try to hurt herself . So you stole her notebook . I didn 't steal it . Okay , I stole it . I just needed an excuse to check in with her . Make sure she 's okay . Sweet . I mean it 's creepy ... But sweet . [ school bell ringing ] Are you doing okay ? Yeah . Why ? Come on . I recognize the look . It 's happening again , isn 't it ? I know this time of year is hard . But you don 't have to be so alone . With your powers , it 'd be so easy to just let me in . You know damn well there are things inside your head you don 't let me see . I 'm sorry . It 's all ancient history . Just try and focus on the present . [ door closing ] What is with you all over me all of a sudden , Jameson ? We , uh , we brought your notebook . You dropped it , so I , uh ... Picked it up ? My hero . Stephen : Hold on ... Look , you did your good deed for the day So you can go check off your community service hour . We ... We 're worried about you . You 're worried about me ? You 're the one who 's hanging out with a schizo . So what does that make you ? A friend . I know about your sister . And I 've lost somebody too . I didn 't lose her . She 's not a set of car keys . I killed her . I wasn 't paying attention . I didn 't even see a train coming . I killed my little sister , okay ? So , if you 're here to tell me that you know What it feels like to have your parents look at you like you 're a murderer ... No . No , I just meant that ... We 'd like to help you . Stephen overheard you talking in the counselor 's office accidentally . That 's funny , ' cause I haven 't been to the counselor all year . So , maybe you 're hallucinating again ? Tim , I need you to search some numbers for me , see if they mean anything . 5-44 , 7-23 , and 9-16 . Tim : They could signify anything . Time intervals . Departure or arrival times for a flight . Train , ferry , bus ... Train . Train . Emily 's sister . Uh ... Search all train schedules . See if there 's a line that hits those times . No matches . You checked everything ? I am a supercomputer . What are you doing ? Nothing . This doesn 't have anything to do with your friend at school . The one who 's mind your reading ? We do not help humans . Yes , thank you , I already got the lecture . Then I don 't need to explain why it 's not worth the risk . I risked my ass for you guys . I hacked into Ultra 's mainframe to help your species track down new breakouts . It 's your species too , Stephen . And I almost got caught thanks to whatever the hell 's going on inside your brain . But just because you can 't deal or don 't give don 't give a damn about humans , doesn 't mean ... What 's he talkin ' about ? You 're right . The real reason not to help these people isn 't because it 's reckless . It 's pointless . They don 't deserve saving . You don 't mean that . The people you love , They don 't know the truth about you . If , when , they discover there 's a freak living in their midst , Then you 'll find out who they really are . Tim : Sorry to interrupt , but I just received an alert via Ultra 's mainframe . It worked . It seems there 's a breakout . In the vicinity of the naval yard . You got an id ? Facial recognition coming through . Tim 's put us ahead of Ultra on a new breakout . Let 's move . I didn 't get any kind of telepathic read on this girl . Maybe that 's ' cause your powers are fritzing out . Russell and I can handle this if you 're not feeling 100 % . Stop coddling me , I 'm fine . You 're not going anywhere . Why not ? John : You 're the inside man at Ultra . We can 't risk you being exposed . Dark-haired female , 5 ' 6 " . Exhibiting paranormal powers somewhere in the vicinity . What a crap-hole . Why would a breakout want to hang here ? Cara : She 's probably confused . Wants to stow away on a ship . Get as far away from home as fast as possible . Girl : I have to get out of here before they figure out I 'm a freak . I got her . She 's here . We 'll cover you . Girl : Please don 't make me go home . You don 't know what they did to me . Cara : It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . Hey ! It 's me , we have to go . I don 't think so . [ yells ] They took her ! We gotta jet ! We can 't help her if we 're dead ! John : They got her . Russell : We don 't know that . Maybe she bolted with the breakout . There was no breakout , it was a damned trap . Jedikiah must have found our drive . I never should have let her go up top , not in the state she was in . Wait , what do you mean ? The night Cara broke out , this bastard attacked her , tried to rape her . Cara fought back . That 's how she discovered she had powers . That was five years ago exactly . This time of year is always rough . It 's like she 's reliving it all over again . So , what do we do now ? What do you think we do ? We go in . No . No , they 'll be ready for us . We don 't have a choice . They 're gonna kill her . Stay here . Stephen . I 'm gonna get her . I 'm the inside man , remember ? Stephen : Jedikiah . Hmm . Jedikiah : Power suppression restraints . Very effective . How 'd you get her ? Jedikiah : Familiar ? What is it ? Just something that mysteriously found its way into my computer system After you came on board . I 've never seen it before . Get Darcy to give me another one of your telepathic brain scans if you don 't believe me . No , I prefer to take you at your word . Learning otherwise would , of course , put you in the same boat as your friend there . Stephen : What are you gonna do to her ? I mean , you can 't kill her . [ scoffing ] I certainly can . Easily . She 's useless . But impressive . Our best telepath could not retrieve a shred of intel on her compatriots . Jedikiah ... Please . Don 't do it . Well , you seem awfully attached . Cara helped me . When I thought I was going nuts , her voice kept me from falling apart . I owe her . You do know that she 's a murderer . A fugitive . Unrepentant . I 'm sorry , Stephen , I can 't justify it . I 'm gonna have to put her down . What if you just take away her powers ? She would be harmless . Now , why would I let her off that easy ? Because of John . He 's in love with her . You take away her powers , you turn her into the thing he hates . Human . Without her telepathy , she 's useless to him . I can 't tell if your being sadistic or self-serving . If you don 't believe me ... Why don 't you let me give her the injection ? [ gasping ] So , now what ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . What are you doing ? It 's the only way . No , Stephen , no ! I 'm sorry , the best I can do is to give you your old life back . No , you don 't understand what it was like for me to be human . No , you don 't understand . If I don 't do this , they 're gonna kill you . Stephen , I can 't ... I can 't go back to who I was . I 'm sorry . Kill me . Just kill me . No . You are a survivor , Cara . You will find a way . No , don 't . [ Cara begging ] [ straining ] No , don 't , Stephen ! [ groaning ] [ bell dinging ] Cara . Cara : Yeah ? Nothin ' . I just didn 't know you were such a good actress . How 'd you know you could do it again ? I didn 't . I just hoped I could . No . No . No , don 't , Stephen ! Oh , my god , Stephen . [ panting ] okay . I 'm gonna inject you with saline . Are you a good actress ? 'Cause you need to give the performance of your life here . Thank you . Ready ? He saved my life . When Ultra had me , I thought ... Hey . You 're safe now . What about Stephen ? If Jedikiah ever sees me using my powers again , You know what will happen to him . He made that choice himself . I would have done the same thing . I 'm just glad I got you back . Me too . I 'm serious , man , you gotta teach me how to do that . There 's still a few casinos I haven 't been banned from . We could do some major damage ! Tim : Pardon me for interrupting . Oh , Tim ! We are having a moment . But are you aware you have 12 missed calls , Stephen ? I believe the eager young woman 's name is Astrid . How do you know that ? My phone doesn 't even work down here . Never mind , you 're a supercomputer . Hmm . Who 's Astrid ? We blocked all cell reception a long time ago . Security measures . I just opened a line for you now . Thank you . [ dialing ] Astrid : Hi . Hey , it 's me . Yeah , look , it 's Emily . Nobody can find her . Um ... Her mom has been calling everybody . I think you were right . She 's hiding something . Her mom said that this last week , she 's totally shut down on them . When did her sister die ? Do you remember the date ? I think it was around now . You don 't think she 's gonna ... Yeah , it 's the anniversary . Astrid , I 'm sorry , I gotta go . Tim , those numbers I gave you didn 't match any train schedules ? That is correct , Stephen . [ sighing ] what about the time intervals ? That 's interesting . They match the westbound blue line . Only the times are off by exactly three minutes . That 's ' cause she 's not planning on hopping a train , She 's planning on getting hit by one . Emily 's been obsessing about dying the same way her sister did . I don 't care about your rules , I gotta stop her . No , Stephen , you can 't . Why the hell not ? Stephen , this girl knows you . You 'll risk exposing yourself if you use your powers in front of her . I 'll go . Cara . I almost lost you once today . I can do this , John . Trust me . [ crossing bell ringing ] [ sobbing ] Between the three of us , I think we can TK the car . Too risky . Wait ... Cara ! It 's okay . She 's got this . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . [ train horn blowing ] Hey . What the hell ? What are you doing ? I might ask you the same question . Are you crazy ? Get out ! No . [ train horn blowing ] Do you think this is what your sister would 've wanted ? How do you know about my sister ? You don 't understand . Everybody blames me . My parents ... What happened was an accident . Killing yourself is not going to bring her back . [ train horn honking ] I know what it 's like to see someone 's face Every time you close your eyes . Killing yourself is not gonna settle the score . [ train clattering ] What 'd you say ? We should go before she sees you . Emily . What do you think 'll happen ? Let 's hope it 's a wake-up call . Maybe now they can all stop living in the past . Stephen : Moment of truth . I hope Emily knows how lucky she is . A mystery woman just talked her off the edge . I think she 's feeling pretty lucky . I meant that she gets to go home . Something I can never do . What happened ? I wanna show you something . Something I 've never shared with anyone . [ pulsating ] [ knocking ] Yeah ? Cara ? [ stammering ] what are you doing here ? Dad ... I can hear . What do you mean , you can hear ? That doesn 't make any sense . Cara , a boy is dead . That boy , do you know who his father is ? No one 's gonna believe that you 're innocent . No one 's gonna believe that you suddenly can hear . Look , you want a life , Then you turn around and you go . And you never come back here . Ever . Cara . [ money rustling ] This is the best I can do . Take this and go . [ thinking ] we 'll be better off without her . Cara . Go . [ sobbing ] Cara ! Bye . [ girl sobbing ] I 'm sorry , Cara . I had no idea . It 's okay . You can 't change what happened . No . You also don 't have to let it define you . Maybe we were given hese powers for a reason . You know ? Our being able to help people like Emily , it 's not playing god . It 's just being human . You 're a real cup 's-half-full kinda guy , aren 't you ? I like that . You did good today . Really good . [ chuckling ] Hey ! You scared the crap out of me . Sorry . Anything you wanna say to me ? Uh , yeah . Text me before you show up in my room Like something out of paranormal activity . Anything else ? About Emily , maybe ? Um ... Yeah . I 'm sorry I hung up on you . I just heard that she 's fine . You know she 's fine . You were at the train tracks . And then , all of a sudden , you were just ... Not . Um ... I appreciate the credit , but I wasn 't anywhere near a train . You 're really gonna stand there and lie to my face ? [ scoffs ] Astrid ... I 'm onto you . And if you don 't wanna tell me the truth , I will go figure it out for myself .

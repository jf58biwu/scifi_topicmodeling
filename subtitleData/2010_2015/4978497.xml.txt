 Some sort of morphic field suspended the human race . 'Cause this miracle , it 's as if something is willing them to go on . What 's wrong with your sister ? She 's not sick . She just ... Can 't cope . Oh my God . They 're ready for a war . No , they were ready for the miracle . Phicorp knew it was coming . I did visit Phicorp and they were kind enough to offer me protection . - In exchange for what ? - The message . - Who are you ? - They could have traced that handset . Yeah , I know . Come on , let 's get the hell out of here . I think we got ' em worried . Sarah ? It 's me . It 's Esther . Sarah ! Are you there ? - Hey . - These people , they were looking for you . They kept asking me questions about you . I know . I 'm sorry . I can 't stay long but - what have you done with the house ? Where are the kids ? They 're in here with me . Can I see them ? Esther , I 'd never hurt them . - But I can 't stay . - Girl : Mom ! I 'm leaving town . I 've got to go today . Don 't go to Boston . There 's cholera in Boston , they said on the news . Don 't go to Philly either - dysentery . New York 's got typhus and hemorrhagic fever . Sarah , that 's just what they 're saying online . - It 's not that bad . - But we 've changed . All of us , didn 't we ? Something in the air infected us . - It made us godless . - Let me in . Let me see the girls . I 'm not letting them out . They can 't come outside . - I won 't let them ! - Let me in , Sarah , please . Mom , tell her to stop ! Honey , I know this is crazy but ... You 're safe , I promise . Look , I 'm working with these people and we 're gonna stop this . I 'm leaving town with them and we 've got some things to do but I 'll come back as soon as I can . Please . Please let me say goodbye to the girls . No . - Mom ! - No . I 'll come back ... As soon as I can , okay ? Hello . Yeah , I 'd like to report - There are two children that I believe might be in danger . Melanie and - and Alice Drummond , daughters of Sarah Drummond . Their address is 1032 King Sovereign Road . I 'm sorry , I can 't give you my name . I just want you to help them . Confirmed . I found Esther Drummond . The pathway to Torchwood is open and clear . Follow her to Harkness . Do what you like with the others . And the miracle continues with health care throughout America now reaching a state of crisis . The courts have been flooded with claims and counter claims as people adjust to a new form of life . I had a heart attack in October . The company replaced me , but I can still work . It 's not like I 'm gonna die , am I ? So if I have to sue them to get my job back , then I will . Who is there to speak for the living when the White House is silent ? The Vatican is silent ? The scientists are silent ? Well , I am not . In business news , pharmaceutical companies are predicting record profits . Phicorp has pledged a payback scheme in local communities around its Los Angeles headquarters . 2700 miles - man , am I sick of your ugly faces . Anyone got change for the meter ? Last thing we need with a stolen car is getting a ticket . No coins . I 've only got plastic . You said no plastic . Hey , my man . You got change for a dollar ? Wow , look at the horizon . We 've reached the edge of America . Decades since I saw the Pacific . Must be about 70 years . Are you kidding when you say things like that ? Oh-ho-ho . I wonder . So where 's Phicorp from here ? Maybe about 10 miles that way . Technically it 's another city . Phicorp headquarters is in Los Angeles and we 're in Venice . We need to find somewhere to hide while we plan the assault . Can 't we stay here by the sea ? Not some stinking , dirty pit for once , Jack . Please ? Hey , man . Believe . Can 't get rid of you can I , dead man walking ? Yeah yeah yeah . Let me ask you something . What is this Dead is Dead shit ? I see posters all over the place . It 's the latest campaign . As if Oswald Danes wasn 't bad enough , this one is led by Ellis Hartley Monroe , one of those small-town mayors trying to make a name for herself . - Where are you ? - Sorry , Doc , no can say . But if I wanted to know where I could get prescription drugs in Los Angeles no questions asked , then you could make your own conclusions . And that 's the only reason you called me ? Well , you are the doctor . - What are you doing in L.A. ? - I never said I was in L.A. Well , it might surprise you to learn that I haven 't got my own private network of drug runners on the West Coast . Come on , Vera . You 'll find a way . I 've seen what you can do with the doctor-patient relationship , and the hippocratic oath , it doesn 't cover it . Ellis Hartley Monroe started the Dead is Dead campaign , and do you know why ? She thinks we should treat people who should have died as if they 're already dead . And right now I think she 's got a point . I 'm busy . Thank you , Rex . You are so gonna call me back . I am so not . We don 't have all day , Dr. Juarez . This hospital has been empty since ' 92 - ' 93 . But it 's still in remarkable condition , all things considered . So if you could listen . Now we have representatives from City General , St. Mary 's , St. Helen 's , The Open Brook , Grand Maple Forest , Attenwood 's and Woolsey Heights , yes ? All of you with I.C.U. Departments stretched to the breaking point . This would be the solution . We bring ' em all here , all the emergency patients en masse . Rather than 15 hospitals at maximum capacity , we have one - this one . This place is abandoned . We 're gonna need equipment and staff . All that taken into consideration . But the strategy would work . So we just put everyone inside and close the door ? Do you know what they used to call that in the old days ? A plague ship . Let me stress this : This is a short-term measure . The plan itself would have to be initiated by tomorrow . - That 's impossible . - That 's not enough time . The people want a health-care solution and they want it immediately . Now for most of the people , Miracle Day is just that - it 's a miracle . People are beginning to move beyond the panic to the possibilities of a golden age . As long as the sick and the old are hidden away from sight . Exactly . But let 's not forget , this isn 't anything new . The western world has always hidden its unwanted . We signed on for that a long time ago before any miracles appeared . And you - you said yourself the plague ship is an old idea . Now I have set up a schedule and I 've made a list of transport liaison managers . I 'm not gonna pretend it ain 't nirvana . If you want somewhere with no questions asked , this is the best I 've got . As long as it 's got electricity and a roof , this is all we need . Hot water would be good . I don 't suppose it 's any good asking who you are . - We 're traveling circus folk . - Yeah , and he 's the clown . - I 'm the bearded woman but I 've shaved . - Yeah , you missed a bit . Cash in hand . And there 's more of that tomorrow as long as you don 't tell anyone we 're here . If anybody does ask you let us know straightaway . Sure thing . By the way , if you get hungry , there 's a cafe on the corner that does a guava jalapeno cheese tart that 's just fabulous . Laters . Fabulous ? What is it with you ? You make everybody around you gay ? That 's the plan . Okay , now we can use this place as our delivery address , we can order that spare server . Then we start in on Phicorp . But first thing we 've got to do is lift out the security profile . Oh , sorry , I 've got to take this . Sorry . Um , yeah . I - sorry . No , you know what Torchwood is like . It 's terrible . I mean we 're living in this ... Shed thing . And there 's no electricity , there 's no water , it 's dark and cold and damp . I thought it was boiling hot in Los Angeles all year round . Yeah well , they lied , Rhys , they lied . What 's that noise ? Is that people ? Yeah , street gangs . Was that a seagull ? Uh , it 's a woman . Uh , on the rampage . A mad woman . Anyway , so how 's my little girl ? - Don 't call me that , Gwen . - You 're very funny . - Do I get to say hello ? - No . It took me two hours to get her to sleep . She was fretting like mad . I 'm not waking her , so tough . I 'm not on holiday , Rhys . I 'm out here working . Still tough . So what 's happening with Phicorp then ? Uh , yeah , things . Esther 's bouncing this signal off the Chinese satellite so I don 't want to say too much just in case . There 's one thing you 've got to sort out , okay ? And that 's my dad . They keep saying the hospitals are full of M.R.S.A. - So can you get him out ? - That 's impossible , honestly . They said on the news no one 's allowed to move . But he 's safe enough , Gwen . I have never felt so far away . Look , I just don 't trust the hospitals , Rhys . Please , there 's go to be something you can do . Look , I 've got to go , okay ? I 'm busy . They really need me . We 're on a mission . Uh , just get my dad out , Rhys , okay ? - I 'll phone you tonight . - It 's already tonight . Torchwood located . Sorry . Rhys . Sorry . We 've all got family . The sooner we get this done the sooner we can see them . Okay , what do you need me to do ? This Phicorp raid means we need to lift out the security protocols on Jilly Kitzinger 's files . You think you can do that ? Mm-hmm . Got Torchwood software ready and waiting . - There is a lot of ... - You 're obsessed with this bastard . I 'm gonna put a permanent trace on him so we always know where he is . What about Kitzinger ? Did we find anything more on her ? She 's freelance . She 's been working with Phicorp for about six months . She 's good , but I don 't think she 's connected . She just happened to be at the right place at the right time . Just like Oswald . We 're wasting our time tracking them . It 's never a waste of time , 'cause our greatest problem is that what 's happened to the world is invisible . But quite by chance Oswald 's found himself right at the heart of it . George Eliot wrote this chapter in " Middlemarch . " She said that if you take a piece of metal with random scratches all over it and hold a flame up to the metal the scratches look like they 're forming patterns circling around the light . And that 's Oswald . He 's blazing away and patterns are starting to revolve around him . And all we have to do is keep watching . Change of plans . Got some statistics here . You 'll need to memorize them . The White House is planning some sort of rally in Los Angeles . We might have to move by the end of the week . But the good news is Phicorp has asked me to stay at your side full time . Evidently someone over there believes you 're important . - Who am I to argue ? - Glorious . I 'll bet that 's killing you , Miss Kitzinger , because you can 't stand the sight of me . No I can 't . No sir , not at all . But it is not my job to like you . I will find your coffee . I will accompany you to the studio , recommend whether Diane Sawyer is better than Piers Morgan . All that and more , but between me and you , it 's your hands . I can 't look at your hands without thinking about what they did . You ever wonder why anyone considers me important ? I 'm sure someone 's got a reason . Wouldn 't you like to know what it is ? Very much so . How much do you know about our masters at Phicorp ? Because I did a little searching of my own last night . It 's been a long long time since I was allowed online . I tried to find out who 's above Phicorp , who owns them . And the strangest thing happened . The information just scattered away . All sorts of names and tangents and diversions , but nothing tangible . And that 's when I recognized the pattern , because I 've had a lot of experience perfecting how to hide myself online . And suddenly I 'm looking at someone else doing the same but on a massive scale - worldwide . I wonder why . Time to go . What for ? Central News 3 : 30 . Isn 't that right ? If you would let me finish , they canceled you . Apparently they booked someone else . Who did they get ? Ellis Hartley Monroe , the darling of the Tea Party . She 's been looped on channel 55 all day long and she 's radical . I think someone 's got to say it . Dead is Dead . We are surrounded by people who should have died . I 'm sorry for them , yes . But these people fill me with terror . Am I the only one brave enough to say it ? They should have perished . I 'm sorry , but they should . And by persisting , they are draining the resources of healthy living citizens . Now I 'm nobody special , but I 'm a mother and a voter and an American . And I 'd like to think that that means something . This is what I want ... - Looks like you 've got a rival . - The Dead is Dead campaign asks ... You 'd better think of a line , Oswald , or you 'll be yesterday 's news . ... And taken to a place that 's safe . And I mean safe for the rest of us . The Dead is Dead campaign asks that these citizens be removed from society and taken to a place that 's safe . All I got - a couple aspirin . Thanks . Haven 't you got family in California ? No , I 'm from New York . But when you were injured I went through your file - There 's no one . Don 't speak ill of the dead ... That 's the problem with this job . - Family always comes second . - I said there 's no one ! Okay ? Because Dead is Dead . And sometimes segregation is vital and necessary . Because these living deceased should not have equal rights . No sir . They should be removed . They should be contained . And then they should wait . Because I believe their passage to the afterlife has but paused . And when this miracle ends , death will find them . Their time will come and they will die . Don 't shoot . It 's me , Dad . What the hell are you doing in my place ? Getting these . You put them back . Those are mine . - Looks like stolen property to me . - So what if they are ? You gonna arrest me ? C.I.A. agents don 't arrest people , Dad . You know that . Yeah , then what ? You gonna torture me ? You people , you 've already ruined the world and now you want to take away a man 's livelihood ? - Somehow this is my fault ? - You and your precious government . You changed the rules on us . Don 't tell me this ain 't some damn experiment . I don 't want to live forever , especially like this . Put the gun down , Dad . Don 't you tell me what to do . Not in my - son of a bitch . Give me that back . No , you 're liable to shoot somebody . It ain 't even loaded . Really ? So what if it is ? I need protection living in this dump . But you don 't have to live this way . Don 't you understand that ? Don 't you pretend to give a shit if I live or die . - Come on , please . - You never cared for anybody - and you know it . - Don 't give me that . That 's bullshit , Dad . That 's bullshit and you know it . What did you come here for , Rex ? Tell me that . What the hell did you come here for ? I - I got hurt , Dad . I got hurt bad . So what ? I 've been dying out here for 15 years . You never once cared . Get the hell out . So to recap , there 's over 100 dedicated servers identical to that one inside the Phicorp building , all containing corporate data . But according to Jilly Kitzinger 's information , # 113 is a secure server accessible by only the highest corporate brass . That 's our target . And when Phicorp says secure , they mean secure . I have never seen firewalls like this before . Our only option is to steal # 113 , to physically take it and cover our tracks by leaving a duplicate in its place . - Which is empty . - So we damage it . Fire damage . Phicorp will think the information is lost , not stolen and they won 't overreact . Oh , sorry . It 's off . That 's your mother , that is . How do you like that then , eh ? All right , I can scout out the building . So how are you gonna get me inside ? I don 't think so . Not your mission , Agent Matheson . You 're still on C.I.A. lists . It 's way too risky to pass you through security . - What makes you any better ? - Jack wiped us off the map , remember ? He 's got a piece of software that removes any reference to Torchwood online . There 's no record of us , unlike you . Okay , Dead is Dead . That 's me , huh ? Rex , you 're a better strategist than any of us . Maybe you can figure out what to do next . Check this out . This is the I.T. center where the servers are housed - Floor 33 , maximum security , completely enclosed . We need to gain access , but it 's restricted with some heavy-duty biometrics . Only one man can gain total access , the man who designed it - Nicholas Frumkin . Well , what kind of biometrics ? I mean , what level ? Every entry needs voice print , palm print , iris recognition by him and him alone . Okay , then I know exactly what you need to do . Oh , hey . My gosh , look at her . She is a beauty . Hey , baby . Don 't I know you ? I swear we 've met before . - You 're ... - I 'm Nicolas . That 's right . Nicholas Jackson , isn 't it ? - No , Nicholas Frumkin . - Yeah yeah . Nicholas Frumkin . Nicholas Frumkin . Nicholas Frumkin . My name 's John Smith . Your baby is just so amazing . - She 's just awesome . - She 's a keeper , isn 't she ? Would you mind holding that for me ? Thank you so much . Look at you . Wow . Thank you . I 'll take that off you . Hey , doesn 't she remind you of our little girl ? Oh , you should see her . You know , we 'd better be moving along . It 's lunch hour , so ... - Oh , there she is . - There she is . Her name is Sally Anne Louise Matilda Jane . - We couldn 't choose . - She 's beautiful . Thank you , I know . Look at her little face ! Got it . So it was awesome meeting you . - Just super good . - Yeah , you too . - See you around . - Sure thing , hot diggity . See you later . Take care . You 're so never doing that accent again . I am mortified . I 'm absolutely mortified . - Vera : I thought you had a system . - We did have a system . The system fell apart . St. Helen 's and Open Brook sent all their patients here at the same time . - We can 't even move them upstairs . - Why not ? Second floor , no electricity . This building has been abandoned for 20 years . Then we get all the patients from Conniston Drive . But that 's a hospice . The hospices are closing down . They 're redundant . But their intake is still sick . So they just sent them without asking ? You know how long it takes to process one patient ? Imagine what we 're dealing with . Hey , the public 's not allowed inside . Look , just take him . Take him ! That 's his books and his pills and he likes that old sweater . You can 't just dump him here with us . Yeah , well , I 'm sick of it . I 'm sick of his piss and his smell . Everything he eats he throws up . Am I supposed to look after him forever now ? I 'm not doing it . I tried but I can 't , okay ? But - but you can 't - ma 'am ! That hallway should be empty . Go and fetch Mr. Holland . This is disgraceful . Doctor , help . Hey , why don 't we get masks ? I know . I 'm sorry , but we haven 't got our procedures right yet . Just give us a little more time . I don 't want to lie next to these . They 're like corpses . I know , I 'm sorry . But they aren 't actually dead . What if they 're infectious ? Can 't you take the baby outside ? It 's not safe in here . They keep talking about disease . - Is she yours ? - I don 't know who she is . She 's not my problem . She was just left there . No one 's checked on her in 20 minutes . It 's not my job . For God 's sake , there 's not paperwork with that baby . There 's no I.D. This is ridiculous . Find Sally Richter . Tell her it 's an emergency . Tell her I said so , Dr. Juarez , City General . Look at this . And we 're calling it a sterile area ? Teething troubles . The transfer itself seems to be working on the whole . Yeah , until we get cholera . Dr. Juarez , I told you this is a temporary measure . - It 's only for a short term . - Then ? What happens next ? - I 'm not at liberty to say . - I am on the medical panel . One of the panels . One of the many panels . One of the 15 , and that 's in D.C. alone . I guarantee plans are being made and we 'll make ... No , that 's not fair , ladies and gentlemen . The slogan " Dead is Dead " is hardly appropriate on hospital grounds . But this project demonstrates the bold thinking that we need in America . Behind me we have people in the right place . It 's as simple as that . People in the right place . Behind those doors they pose no danger to society . Over here ! Tiny little problem . Those cameras were here for me . I know . It 's just a timing malfunction , that 's all . The moment I lose my platform I get thrown back to the mob . And I 'm not doing that . Do you hear me ? I 'm never going back . So if you don 't want me angry with you , missy , if you don 't want Phicorp angry with you , you 're gonna put this right . Is that understood ? Perfectly . ... The words of Ellis Hartley Monroe , a philosophy which is now sweeping around the country . She 's put drug campaigners such as Oswald Danes in the shade as her popularity soars . The Dead is Dead campaign has connected ... This is why I need your pledges and support , not for me , but for the greater good . Because I want to fund a program nationwide that rebuilds our wonderful cities , that zones them to redistribute the population in accordance with the miracle . This would be a new America , a new world , a new heaven . Now it seems to me we 've relied too much on the pharmaceutical companies , or as I call them , drug dealers . Companies like Phicorp profit off disaster and I think that 's wrong . Oswald ! Oswald ! He 's going in , Mrs. Monroe . Why don 't you ? We 'll keep these doors closed because this must be hygienic . See ? Very hygienic . He 's a brave man . I wouldn 't go in there . - Do you know who that is ? - Reporter : Oswald ! I think that they are scared of you . But not me . I 'm not scared of you . And how - after all , how could I be ? Because we 're the same . Yes we are . I am just the same as you . I 'm so cold . Oh , it 's all right . Of course . Of course . Here , hang on . Just a moment , please . There we go . Everything is will be fine . There . How is that ? Oswald ! Oswald ! You 've been abandoned , all of you . You 're the unwanted . And there are people out there who are preaching all sorts of dangerous lies about you . And who is out there talking on your behalf ? Hmm ? I 'm here to tell you I will . I promise I will . Because you need help . You need food . And you need security . And I swear to you I will not rest until those things are given to you . And I will help you . - Man : Bless you . - Yes , and you . I 'm here to help . I will help all of you . Yes , join with me now . And I can understand your pain , all of you . I understand it because I have suffered the same as you . I still recognize you behind that mask . You bastard . That 's okay . No , that 's fine . I understand , sir . I will not hide . I have come in here to stand beside you . And I am proud of that , sir . I will not hide my face . But we 're the same . Don 't you see ? I was supposed to die . I was abandoned . And I was faithless . And I was lost . But look at me . Look at me . I mean after the miracle , I have risen . Oh , I have risen with unending life . And I can promise all of you that same rapture . Oswald , over here ! Please , whoever you are , this child 's been abandoned . Can 't you get her some help ? Oh , poor little thing . Of course . You see , she 's fine now . Dead is not dead . No , not anymore . Life is life . Aw , look at her . I can promise you with all my heart , this little girl will live forever and ever and ever . And ever ! Listen , clear the damn schedule . It is Oswald 24 / 7 from here on out . - Oh , Dr. Juarez . - This is disgusting . I know ! If you think I 'm sharing a camera with that man ... What the hell am I paying you for ? Get a hold of Fox , tell them I 'm heading for New York . Hotel then airport . No , hotel first . Then I need to see Mr. Coulidge . Can you find his address ? It 's in the book . This coffee tastes kind of weird . What do you want ? What 's your name , sir ? I 'll give you money . I just need your name , nice and clear if you could . Frumkin - Nicholas Frumkin . There 's an organization , Mr. Frumkin , called Torchwood . Now I 'm only telling you this so you know who 's to blame . Torchwood is about to access your secure site , which means I also need access using your biometrics . I can tell you how to get in . There 's a code . No there 's not . There is . I swear to you , there 's a code that you can use to - shh shh shh . I 'm afraid I studied all the specifications . The protocol is quite clear . I need the biometrics of poor Nicholas Frumkin . Which means firstly your voice . Consider that done . - And then ... - Please . Please don 't . Please . It 's your system , which means it 's your fault . Because the next thing I need is the palm of your hand . And then one of your eyes . But just one . No ! Don 't worry , no one dies . Ah ! Whoo ! Everything online ? Yeah . Good signal . Those two clowns should be in position . I 'll go check that 105 access . You know , I should be running this operation , not going to check the road . I 'll be back . Social Services . Hi . Yes , I 'm calling from F.B.I. police liaison . I was given this number by Susan Malpass . I just need to check some details on , let me see , the name 's Drummond . Sarah Drummond , King Sovereign Road . I 've got it right here . Children - Alice , seven and Melanie , eight . That 's it . We 're just chasing an update . Well , they 're in the system now . Right . I 'm sorry . What does that mean ? It 'll take a few days . They 'll stay at Brayden Long Heights until we can find them foster homes . We 'll try and keep them together . It shouldn 't be too much of a problem . I 'm sorry . Are you saying that they 've been removed from the home ? That 's right . This morning at 8 : 00 a. m . I thought you said you were gonna work with the family . We tried . Of course we did . But it wasn 't considered safe . And the mother has been admitted for psych . She what ? She 's been under observation in the psych ward under the care of a Dr. - where is it ? Dr. Cottesloe . That 's it . No report on file yet . Should be something in tomorrow or the next couple of days . What happened ? How did she end up like that ? What did you say your name was ? Where is she ? Where is she now ? I 'm sorry , who are you exactly ? Can I ask what 's the reason for this call ? Okay . Okay okay . Access is fine . Let 's see those two do their stuff . Okay , here we go . Good luck . - What is wrong with good luck ? - It 's kids ' stuff . Torchwood keeps treating this like it 's a game . Oh , I 'm sorry . Are we interrupting you ? Who could be sending you messages right now ? It 's just this thing . It 's personal . - No one should have that number . - Shh shh , we 're in . - Can I help you ? - Yes , I 'm here for the training sessions . Your name ? Yvonne Pallister , international sales . Only problem is I don 't see any training going on today . I got an email last night from Lorraine in Human Resources . - I 'll call them . - Okay . Phicorp Human Resources . This is Lorraine . How may I help you ? Yeah , I have an Yvonne Pallister down here . She says there 's some kind of training . Yes . Send her right up . - Floor 21 . - Okay . - Floor 21 . Go on up . - Thank you . Hold up . Hold up . Who are you ? - Delivery . - I don 't have anything on my schedule . It says Human Resources . Human Resources . Yes , our document shredder had crapped out . We had to rush a new one . Send it on up . Sure thing . - Go on up . Need some help ? - No , I 'm good . What 's wrong with you ? Nothing . Hello , handsome . Love the uniform . Ditto . Come on . Oh , hold on . Whoever wears heels to work is heroic . Why do women put up with these things ? Look at ' em ! The fire department 's average response time is 12 minutes . When they arrive , Esther 's gonna direct them to the 14th floor . That should buy us another five minutes before they start checking other floors . Let 's go , mistress . Fire on the 14th . Please exit the building . Please state your full name . Nicholas Frumkin . Please place your right hand on the sensors as indicated . Please look closely at the circle below . Iris in five . Access granted . I never thought that would work . Welcome back , Nicholas . - They 're in . - Good . You want to tell me what 's wrong ? My sister - child protective services - they took her kids . And they 've got your number ? No , I set up a relay . It 's anonymous , okay ? All right . And if you really want me to be heartless , Rex , I 'm the one that reported her . Happy now ? Server 113 . Little bastard . Now she 's on the telephone ? What the hell is wrong with you people ? - Yeah , Anwen all right ? - She 's fine . She 's at home . Look , I know you 're busy , - but I was just phoning about your dad . - Is he okay ? He 's fine . Same as ever , no change . I just saw him and he sends his love . But I did what you said and I made a fuss about getting him moved . Okay look , I haven 't got time for this , sweetheart . Just tell me , can you get him out of there ? Yes I can . Shall I go ahead ? Oh , I love you . I love you . I love you . I love you . Just do it and leave me alone . Oh , and give Anwen a big kiss . Okay ? Bye . - Good luck . - Okay , go . Reattach 655-321 . Still , it must have been tough though . There 's nothing else I could have done . She wouldn 't even let me see them . She had the house all barricaded up . Wait , you saw the house ? Well , yeah . You went by the house ? What if you were followed ? Oh my God , you 're such an idiot . I 'm doing my job , okay ? And then 322-340 . You 've compromised the security of the entire mission ! Come on ! 322 . Okay , 324 . - I 've lost her . - What the hell just happened ? Gwen . Output from the I-5s goes dead without consciousness . - Oh , so she 's unconscious now ? - I don 't know . I warned you ! Gwen ! Can you hear me ? - It 's back . - Are you all right ? - Oh no . - Can you hear me ? Who did this , Gwen ? Oh no no . Please God , no . God damn it ! This is all your fault ! Come on . Come on . Esther , can you override this elevator ? I can 't . The fire department has closed the whole thing down . Okay . Rex , it 's 33 floors . 66 flights of stairs and you 've got a ruptured chest . Oh , man . Good luck . Ah ! Ah ! Jack . - You okay ? - Yeah . - What happened ? - Man : I did . I 'm so sorry . Who the hell are you ? Names aren 't important right now . Oh great , he 's cryptic . What do you want ? Well , clearly you dead . - Then why am I still alive ? - That 's the point . It 's got to be said Miracle Day has hardly been advantageous for those in my line of work - the day the killing stopped . But I can 't tell you , Jack , how wonderful it is , how truly wonderful it is to meet somebody who 's mortal . It 's my holy grail . If he 's the only one that can die , then it 's in your interest to keep him alive . That 's exactly what I 'm doing . Haven 't you noticed the absence of killing ? Because this captain ... Fascinates me . I 've been paid to eradicate him . But that only makes me wonder why . - What makes you so different ? - I don 't know . And yet you 're the only one left , the only true human . If I knew , I would tell you . I 'm trying to find out the same thing myself . Yes , I know . Thank you . Who employs you ? Don 't you have any idea , Jack ? They told me it was a very long time ago . Don 't you remember ? Who ? Who told you that ? This would be so simple in the old days . Tell me what I want ... - Ooh ! - Or I 'll slit her throat . I keep wondering during these miraculous days , would it be better or worse knowing that her pain will last forever ? I think better . - Leave her alone . - Then tell me ! I don 't know . You 're very special to them , Jack . They trust me enough to tell me that . But I hear rumors of miracles yet to come , of a new society being forged here on Earth . And I 'd like to guarantee my place . So tell me , what did you give them so long ago ? When ? Tell me who 's employing you . You 'll never stop them , for this is who they certainly are . They are everywhere . Shit . They are always . They are no one . They have been waiting for such a long time ... Searching the world for a specific geography . What the hell does that mean ? That means that they 've found it . And they 've made it magnificent . - Who are they ? ! - They once had names . Long ago . And those names were - Oh shit . He was just about to tell us . Thanks ? Anybody ? Thanks ? And you shot him in the throat . Well , Dead is Dead . It 's such an unfortunate phrase - Dead is Dead . It 's coarse . I know as a survivor it 's hurtful . The last thing that we need right now is a campaign that 's going to empower the mob . The words of Oswald Danes are quickly becoming a worldwide phenomena . Today the story of Danes and the abandoned child truly went viral . As the White House stays silent we ask is Oswald Danes now becoming the voice of the people ? Is he the one true representative of this miracle age ? You are trending like never before , you clever bastard . Miss Kitzinger , you make it all sound planned . I was just trying to help those unfortunate souls . Well , it 's working . Guess what they 're calling you in France . The Sainted Danes . That 's almost blasphemous . And now you 're a definite for the miracle rally . Flights are booked to Los Angeles . They want you to speak from the stage and guess who you 're replacing . Ellis Hartley Monroe ? Ellis Hartley Monroe . She must be livid . We contacted the office of Ellis Hartley Monroe asking for a response but they told us Mrs. Monroe will not be making any statements for the foreseeable future . Mrs. Monroe , we 'd like to apologize . We 're really very very sorry about this . Indeed , we 'd like to imagine if time and tides had flown a different way we could have almost been friends . I hope that 's some consolation at the end . Truth of it is , we liked your message , Mrs. Monroe . We liked your style , but we already have Oswald Danes . We don 't need another . And certain aspects of your strategy were revealing our hand just a little too soon . And we have been planning this so carefully for such a long time . Because we are everywhere . We are always . We are no one . And soon the families will rise . Anything yet ? It 's gonna take days , weeks . But I 'm rushing through a primary sift for basic patterns . - Good morning . - Yeah . Thanks again for saving my ass yesterday . I was saving her ass . You were just gravy . I 'm sorry I made such a mess of it . That was your final warning . You give it any more thought ? That maniac said it was someone you knew . Not that easy when you 've lived through thousands of years . Gonna keep talking that shit , huh ? Got it . First basic pattern . Land prices . Estimates dating back years . And they 're all linked to these construction plans . - Rex : Plans for what ? - They 're calling them overflow camps for all the patients in I.C.U. Looks like Phicorp is taking charge of them , like they own them . They sold some kind of strategy to the U.N. Phicorp and whoever else is behind them . But what the hell are they up to ? Whatever it is , I bet it ain 't good . Bollocks ! Bollocks ! I am so so sorry . I have been so busy I didn 't ring you back . But look , I 'm gonna call you back in half an hour and that is a promise . Calm down . Don 't worry . I 'm phoning with good news , that 's all . It 's about your dad . - What is it ? What 's happened ? - I said it 's good news . Now stop and listen , you daft thing . I 've got him onto that scheme , top of the list . What scheme ? Government 's stepped in to prop up the N.H.S. They 're spending millions , they said . They 're building these sort of camps to help people . - Overflow camps ? - Aye , that 's it . And I got your dad inside the South Wales site . Okay , Rhys , listen to me . Do not let them go . Do not let them take my father . I haven 't got time to explain , just bloody move . - They just moved him out . - Then stop them . Okay ? This is bloody Phicorp , Rhys , and they are up to something . Move ! Don 't let them go ! Just get him back . Get him back now . Gwen , it 's too late . They 've got my dad , Jack . They 've got my dad .

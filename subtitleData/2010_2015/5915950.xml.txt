 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You did well . Pick it up . I hear you 've been looking for this . And only someone who can carry the diviner Is allowed to enter the city . Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D. , And you an expert on the obelisk . Together , I think there 's much we can achieve . You know you 've lied to me . This happens every time ... we get closer , you get nervous . Everything we 've been doing leads here . Our job ... find it before anyone else . If there 's evidence of this city on earth , The computer will find it . Hello ? ! Coulson ! Coulson ! Where 'd everybody go ? ! Where 'd everybody go ? Coulson ! That sound ... What is that ? Coulson . What are you doing ? We have a mission to prep for . This is the mission . It opens . So weird , right ? N-no ! Sacrifices have to be made . Poison tree , poison fruit . I know . Bye-bye , angel eyes . No . Wait . Wait ! Don 't leave her ! Coulson . May ! Wait ! Coulson ! Skye , wake up . Sorry I startled you . You okay ? Hi . Yeah . I just dozed off . Grab your things . We 're back . Look out ! There we go . Coming through , coming through . Watch out , watch out . Coming through , coming through . Hey , hey , take it easy with that . I made that for coulson . Hey , you know , if you 're looking for vacation time , Bribery will get you nowhere , 'cause I 've tried . No , I 'm hoping he 'll let me work on the real thing . Brilliant . And so how do you get it to fly ? It doesn 't . Aww . What ? Something wrong ? Storm 's coming . No , weather 's fine , actually . There 's not a cloud in the sky . I checked . No , never mind . Were you looking for me ? Yeah . Actually , um , the ... Actually , I need to go to the plane . What , you need help with the holographic towers ? No , no , no , no , no , no . The descender rig ? What ? No , simmons . Have to ... I have to give her a case , and then ... You know at some point You 're gonna have to talk to her , right ? Good luck with the car . You 're very lucky , trip . If they hadn 't used that clotting agent on your wounds ... Well , let 's just say I 'm glad they did . I recommend a week of solid bed rest . Where 's that in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Handbook ? Whoa , stop it ! You 're going to rupture your sutures . I won 't be high-fiving anybody for awhile , but I 'm okay , jemma . There was a doctor in the house , remember ? So , what was he like ? Skye 's dad ? Yes . That man was out of his damn mi ... Hey . Hi , skye . Hey , yourself . Mission prep in five , cargo hold . Right . Roger that . Talking about my dad ? I 'm sorry . It must be so ... Messed up ? I was going to use the off-color version of " messed up , " But it felt inappropriate . Oh , it 's appropriate . My dad , ward , the obelisk , the city ... it 's all messed up . And ... I just ... I can 't shake this vibe That something really bad is about to happen . Yeah , I got that covered already , so you can lose that vibe . We 're good . That 's right . Yeah . Nothing but positive thoughts from here on out . That 's not wood , is it ? Here 's what we know . They have the obelisk and an expert who knows how to use it . We can 't let that happen , obviously . Use it how ? Based on our latest intel , There 's something very powerful inside it ... a weapon . Are we talking chemical , biological , energy-based ... ? Could be anything . It 's alien . While simmons and I were undercover at hydra , Whitehall was looking to create an extinction-level event To kill millions of people . We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that . Because bad guys love their wmds . Trick is , to activate the obelisk , Hydra has to take it to specific place . It 's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead ... Now they need the lock ... a temple inside the city . Any idea where this temple is ? But it 's in the city , and we now know where that is . Even better , hydra doesn 't . Fitz ? On our mission to australia , We hacked a military satellite network . We ran a multispectral topographic scan of the earth , Miles deep through the oceanic crust , Looking to match ancient rock formations With the 3-d model of the city . And we found this . Isn 't that in the bermuda triangle ? 'cause that would explain a lot . Actually , it doesn 't have anything to do With the triangle . We solved that back in the ' 80s . Uh , atlantis ? Try puerto rico . Represent vertical air shafts that are close to the surface , Possible entry points for the city , But most of them are under the ocean floor . Except for one ... here , in old san juan , Where we 'll enter the underground city . A survey team will test the tunnel 's structural integrity , Then locate the temple . And then what , sir ? We blow the hell out of it . What about the obelisk ? It 's still dangerous all on its own . One crisis at a time . Come on ... what do you mean you can 't break a hundred ? Sorry . Nothing over $ 20 . I 've changed my mind . I 'd like a chia water instead . You got it , babe . Make it two . I 've been thinking about our next trip . Maybe shanghai ? You have expensive tastes . And a wandering spirit . Be right back . Thank you . You know , agent may , the whole point Of embedding a tracker in somebody Is that you don 't have to stalk them . Or did you just come by to say ... hello , raina . Dr. Whitehall would like a word . Gonna want to make your next right . Unless you want to spend your last night on earth In the hotel hydra . How ... I 'll explain later . Come here . Give me a hug . I 'm not hitting on you , okay ? I 'm S.H.I.E.L.D. Okay , just ... Stay close . And stay quiet . Shh . Bye-bye , hydra . I 'm agent sam koenig . Coulson sent me . Sorry , but ... You 're gonna need a lanyard . I 'm telling you , sir , she looked exactly like agent may , Except for the freaky facial-scar thing . That was agent 33 . She was wearing a nanomask , disguised as may , But may electrocuted her right in the face . Oh , that is so badass . Sam , I 'm on with the director . You were saying you think hydra was there to kidnap raina , Well , we counted four two-man teams , All non-tactical , all in full surveillance mode . And the freaky one told raina That whitehall wanted to talk . Question is why ... And why now . No idea , sir , but this is the first sighting We 've had of hydra since you let raina out in the wild . I 'm sending agent may with an extraction team . Sit tight until they get there . Copy that , sir . He 's sending the cavalry . Sweet ! You can 't do a sit-up . You think you 're gonna hook up with the cal ... More news on the investigation Of the horrific murder-suicide Of massachusetts senator christian ward . Fbi sources claim That while the senator did leave a recorded confession , Other evidence found at the scene Suggests another party may have been involved . Meanwhile , senator ward 's ... He did it . You know ward did it . No doubt in my mind . The senator should 've let us help . We tried , but he wanted nothing to do with us . All we can do now is try and catch ward . Or put the son of a bitch down . Change of plans . We 're splitting up the teams . We 're going after ward ? No , we 're not . Hydra found raina . Tried to grab her in vancouver . Grab her . Not kill her . They 're grasping . Hydra knows we found the city . Maybe they think she can help them . We 're pulling an extraction . I 'll head on to the city in the quinjet With bobbi , mack , and fitz-simmons . We need to locate that temple . So , you want me to go with them ? We 're all anxious to see the city , But I 'd like you to run point on raina 's interrogation . I think she 'll respond to you . Yes , sir . I 'll spread the word . You don 't want skye anywhere near that city , do you ? It 's not the city I 'm afraid of . It 's her lunatic father . Keep an eye on her , okay ? Of course . I 'm her s.O. Quinjet 's prepped . Yeah , I was looking for the dwarf case . Well , ask fitz . I 'm sure he 'll know . Ah . No . I 'm sure it 's around here somewhere . So ... How long were you two a thing ? A thing ? Fitz and I ? No . I mean , we never .. I-I never dreamed ... okay . I 'm just gonna stop you right there . You 'd have given me about nine visual cues to put you away . Maybe 10 . Look , I ... I know the story ... Of what ward did to you two How fitz 's brain was damaged . That 's not your issue , is it ? No . So , what happened ? We were in the bottom of the ocean in a storage pod , Left for dead , and fitz ... He said something that caught me completely off guard . Ah , those three little words . Yes . Well , no . I mean , not exactly . I barely had a moment to process what he was saying Next thing I know , he 's giving me the oxygen , Water 's rushing in , and He 's ... He 's laying there , in the hospital bed . He was so pale . How long was fitz in the coma ? Nine of the longest days of my life . And when it finally broke , he ... he couldn 't speak , he ... He just stared at me , confused . All I wanted to do was help him . All I wanted was my best friend back . Your best friend . I never thought of him as anything else . That said , I can 't imagine my life without him . It 's all very confusing . You 've never told him any of this , have you ? Oh , lord , no . Yeah , it 's tough . I wish I could give you some advice , But I 've never been friends with a guy first . It 's always been a roller coaster . Fast out of the gate , hit the drop , the turn , The loop , the screeching halt , then ... Back in line to do it all over again . But is the ride worth it ? I 'll let you know when it 's over . You know ... At the very least , you should be honest with him . If you don 't have trust ... Don 't die out there , okay ? It 's canada . You two okay ? Yeah . Ready when you are , sir . Good . Head on up . All right . Time to go . I 'll see you in san juan . See you there ... Sir . So ... You and hunter ... Again . I know . Mm . Been through it enough times . I know . Gluttons for punishment , I 'd say . Let 's not go down this road , okay ? You 're a big brother , but you 're not my big brother . Your personal life , that 's your business . I 'm just wondering if it means you 're bringing hunter in On the other thing . That ? No . Well , I figured after we lost hartley , you 'd try to ... No , he has no idea . And I 'd like it to stay that way . Copy that . Excuse me , mate . Somebody call an ambulance ! This guy just passed out ! That 's impressive . Thanks , billy . No , I 'm sam . Billy 's the shorter one . Two more down . That 's not sam 's knock . You two have a knock ? Yeah , we 're brothers . Of course we have a knock . Lanyard , please . You can 't just look through the damn peep hole ? I 'm billy . Sam 's the shorter one . Okay . Right . Well , we need to move . Come on . Go for the stairs ! Stairs , copy ! Stand down , agent 33 ! We can help you ! Unh ! I don 't need your help . We need to ... what the hell is that ? May 's evil twin , formerly known as agent 33 . I thought the koenigs were creepy . Tell coulson we 're on our way . Yes , ma 'am . No tails on the way in ... none that I could spot , anyway . Then we 're good . You ever had the fried plantains here ? I read about this place down the street Where they put crab in them . I wouldn 't mind trying that . You know , after we save the world . Diego texted me . He 's gonna be late . He 's always late . Said he 'd meet us on the other side of the plaza . This contact of yours , can we trust him ? He 's a politician , so , no , but he likes me . And he can get us those architectural plans ? Yes , and he 'll keep the local cops off of us . Things could get sticky , depending on where we 're digging . Ooh . Hats . Wish I was a hat guy . Some guys can really pull that look off , you know ? What ? Too small ? You know , for a guy Who 's about to blow up a chunk of an underground city , You don 't seem fazed . Just want to make sure that we 're here To destroy that weapon , not recover it . Why would we do that ? That 's what fury would do . I 'm not fury . But he did hand you the keys to the kingdom for a reason . Look around you . Vendors selling their wares , bringing home a modest income . Locals buying fresh vegetables for dinner tonight . Tourists on their one vacation a year . Point ? They are the point . They 're the reason I 'm here , the reason there 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. There are 3 million people on this island , And I won 't let hydra turn them into collateral damage . With all due respect , sir , This kind of op , fury would have a number . A number ? Of acceptable losses . My number is zero . For the record , I hate that phrase . That 's why I brought fitz-simmons ... Not just to find the temple But to assess its structural integrity , Minimize injury or destruction . Minimize destruction ? You really aren 't fury , are you ? Come on , bobbi . You ought to know me by now . Rather use a scalpel than a shotgun . Well , it 's hydra . Might need the shotgun . Why do you think I brought you ? There 's diego . I 'll be right back . I 'm gonna go check on the landing gear . What ? No , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . No , no . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Why ... why ? Because the awkward silence in here ... Is killing me . I 'd like to say something . I 've been thinking ... Please let me go first . No ... I don 't ... There 's something I need to ... I know I 've got ... No , I ... I know things have been difficult between us Since I got back from being undercover , But I need you to understand that I didn 't leave Because of what happened to you . Jemma , please , because I 've got a whole ... It 's ... it 's hard enough to get the words out . I 've been thinking , and I 'm going to leave the lab So you can be the one who runs the science division . You 're quitting ? I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm going to the garage , on the bus with mack . But why ? You know why . You 're clearly far more ca ... cap ... capable than I am . At this point , anyway . That 's not true . You just need more time to heal and ... I 've had time , and I 'm ... and I 'm not better , So you should run the lab ... And I can work for you . I just can 't work with you . And ... I think that 's what 's best . The fort of san cristobal ... Held off the dutch , the english , the americans . But apparently , not the aliens . Looks like your buddy diego drew those plans . He got them from the city archives . They 're older than san juan itself . According to skye 's satellite spectrometry , There 's a vertical shaft under this fort . Looks like it 's right at the water 's edge . Think we 'll get a better vantage point from up there . The garrison is located underneath that sentry tower . That 's the deepest part of the fort . And inaccessible to the public . All the better for us . Won 't be easy to get equipment down there . Get ahold of diego ... See if he can help us out . We need to stay ahead of hydra . Even if hydra locates the city , How do you think they plan on unlocking the obelisk ? I mean , nobody can even touch the damn thing . That we know of . Corner , two men wearing classic hydra black , Trying desperately hard not to look conspicuous . And failing . Where 's may ? Good question . I 'll go check . S.H.I.E.L.D. Must be quite happy . Your plan of dangling me like bait seemed to work . I thought whitehall wanted to kill you , not kidnap you . Something must 've changed his mind . Maybe he thinks you know something about the obelisk . How it works . Are you saying whitehall has the diviner ? Someone give that girl a new flower dress . Well , that changes things . How so ? They don 't want to kill me . They need me . Need you for what ? I can hold the diviner . You mean the thing that turns people to stone ... You can touch it ? You don 't believe me . Honestly , everything that we 've been through , I don 't know what to believe anymore . When you hold it , these symbols appear . There 's a pull to them , Like a sense of where the diviner belongs . Sounds a little " harry potter " to me . It 's alien technology . The diviner reads your dna To determine if you 're worthy of its power . You 'll understand when you touch it . No , thanks . I 'd rather not die just yet . You wouldn 't , not according to your father . He believes you 're worthy , too . Listen , if you think you 're gonna trick me Into touching that thing , you 're as crazy as he is . It 's not crazy . It 's our destiny . I 'm over here ! I 'm over here ! Found may . Get in ! They 've got her , sir . I 'm sorry , but she did mention That they implanted a tracker in her . How fortunate . I 'll get my best man on it right away . So , what happened to agent 33 ? You guys just left her there ? We had to . Hydra was closing in . We almost didn 't make it out . I wonder if that 's weird for may . Someone else having your face like that . It 's just creepy . Hey , trip , how 's the shoulder ? Uh ... It 's getting better . Thanks . We were talking about agent 33 . Ooh , with the freaky fried may face . Yeah , and the scary robot voice . Oh . Crush , kill , destroy ! " lost in space " ? Tv show ? You ... Is there something in my teeth ? What ? No . No . No , I was , um ... I was just wondering , how many of you are there , anyway ? Brothers , I mean . 13 . 13 . 13 ? Look at him . He fell for it . Yeah . That gets people every time . Yeah , yeah , you ... you got me . You got me good . Yes , the extraction was a success . Skye 's with raina now . How big was the hydra contingent ? But they sent agent 33 to take point . You know she still has my face ? I heard . Lucky her . Any theories why they came so hard at raina ? Skye has one ... raina claims That she can touch the obelisk without being harmed . That 's ridiculous . I swear on my ... Said that it would lead them to the temple . Do you believe her ? This is serious . Skye does . You were right about raina opening up to her . Have her stay at it . You can 't leave right now . See if skye can get me any recon on that temple . Copy that . Where 'd your friend diego go ? He won 't go down into the garrison . Turns out he 's afraid of the legend . What legend ? They call it la garita del diablo ... The devil 's sentry . The fort was built in the 18th century And helped repel some of our british ancestors When they tried to invade the island . But this particular guard tower was built in 1634 And is well-known as being haunted . Now , that 's a deep hole . And haunted , apparently . Not scared of ghosts , though , are you mack ? I mean ... of course not . But w-what was that story ? The story is , several of the guards Went missing in the middle of the night from this tower , Never to be seen again . They simply vanished . It 's all preposterous , really . About as preposterous as an alien city . How 's it coming ? Uh ... Well , um ... You should , um ... Why don 't you ... No , it 's all right . You go first . No , no , that 's all right . Fitz , this is your ... I know , but you ... someone start talking . Uh , we are ready to deploy , sir . Would you like me to ... No , no . Um ... How long will it take to survey the tunnel And locate the temple ? Uh , it depends on several factors , Like the tec ... tec ... tect ... Don 't look at me . Uh ... Uh ... The , um ... The tec ... Tectonic stress levels , yes , and the structural ... Structural integrity of the tunnels , how damaged they are . How will you know what the temple looks like ? Well , we 'll know it when we see it , I guess . We 'll be depending entirely on the data the dwarfs send us . What just happened ? Uh , the tablet 's still working . Looks like they just went out . My very own S.H.I.E.L.D. I.D. We match . I 'm sorry for trying to run . I just got swept up in the moment . You 're lucky coulson 's the forgiving type . Actually , I feel very lucky we found each other . Your father 's told me so much about you . It 's funny , since I 've never met him . Of course you have . When you were born . Did you know he actually delivered you ? He also killed a whole bunch of people . He almost killed my friend trip . Does he get emotional ? Yes . Violent , even ? Yes . But he 's also ... Quite misunderstood . Then help me understand him . Where did you two meet ? Thailand . I was just a petty con artist , scamming tourists , Running with a bunch of freaks , as we liked to call ourselves . My father was one of your freaks ? No . He took us in , cleaned us up ... Showed us we weren 't freaks at all . Before I met your father , I was a lost soul with no clue of where I belonged . The daughter he never had . No . No one could ever replace you , skye . You 're all he wants . All right . Let 's get some light down there . Eyeballing it , it looks at least 100 feet . That 's all right . I 'm not scared of heights . The dark , however ... Just get those dwarfs back online . Well , sir , it might not just be the dwarfs . Could be all electronics . Be honest , skye . Haven 't you ever felt lost ... Or had that feeling that you were part of something bigger ? Like you were special ? When you say " special , " what you really mean is " alien . " Is that what you believe ? We 're human , skye . We just have the potential to be more . But the diviner ? Now , that is most definitely alien . Where do you get this stuff ? My father ? Partly . But my grandmother came from a long line Of special people who believed in a story , About the blue angels that fell from the heavens . The ancients called them the kree . And what do the kree want ? Change . That 's why they left the diviner , As a guide to the temple , So the worthy would inherit the earth . And do you know where this temple is ? That 's what the diviner shows you . Only the worthy are allowed inside To witness its true power . And what happens to the people who aren 't worthy ? I hope they 've said their goodbyes . Three pulls on the cable means " help , " got it ? Yes , sir . Let me down easy , turbo . Please be careful . We can 't let them go down there , may . You can 't let raina get into your head . She 's not lying . Was meant to guide the worthy to the temple . You see this ? It 's the same symbol I saw on the obelisk . It 's got to be the temple . You 're sure ? Trust me . It is seared into my brain . We have to warn coulson now . Something bad is about to happen . Damn it ! Why isn 't this working ? S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 ... do not engage your defenses , Or you will be shot out of the sky . Whitehall . There 's hydra quinjets outside the windows on both sides . Then let 's step on it , shall we ? You have someone aboard that I want ... a woman named raina . I 'm going to send over a representative to get her . Any attempt to evade or retaliate Will be met with hostile fire . Uncloak and prepare to be boarded . Destiny calls . I hit bottom . Copy ? Hey , I hit bottom ! Okay ! Aah ! Aah ! Aaaaaah ! Aaaaaah ! He 's struggling on the line ! Before the dwarfs went down , They scanned for signs of life . All readings were negative . Wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! I can see him ! He 's coming up ! Hang on ! Get the harness off him ! Hey , talk to me , mack ! Mack ! Aaaah ! Stand back . Mack , talk to me ! What happened ? Were you attacked ? I don 't see any wounds or signs of blood . Mack ! What did you say ? I can 't hear you . Run ! Aah ! Oh ! Coulson ! I 'm not going to give up the lives of everyone on this plane for raina . She 's not worth it . Hydra already has the obelisk . If they have raina , too ... Coulson 's already on site . Hydra 's not . How the hell did they find us ? - We were cloaked . - Raina 's tracker . Old frequency S.H.I.E.L.D. Used during the cold war . What can I say ? I 'm a history buff . Lower your weapons . Anyone shoots , the plane goes down . We all die . Maybe it 's worth it . Let 's not get carried away just yet . First , you gave us bakshi . Now you 're back with hydra ? Pick a side , ward . Oh , I have . Don 't worry . Let 's go . With pleasure . You , too . What ? I made you a promise , skye . I 'm here to keep it . You 're coming with us . The hell she is . Snap out of it , mack ! I don 't want to hurt you . Fitz , icer ! He 's not going down ! Why isn 't he going down ? She 's not going anywhere . - She comes , or the deal 's off . - Shut up . May , if I don 't go with him , he 's gonna blow this plane to pieces . They 're hydra . They 'll do it anyway . You can 't trust him , skye . Yes , you can . Skye , look at me . Don 't talk to her . Come with me , we won 't fire a single shot . Everyone gets out alive . Is that what you told my brother before you killed him ? How many of you are there ? Skye You can 't . There 's no other way . You know that . Whatever happens , I can handle myself . Oh , skye , don 't forget your tablet . You know , the one with the map of the city on it . Mack ... It 's me . Ohh ! Aah ! Please , mack , wake up . Don 't make me do this . Aah ! I got you . Shoot him , fitz ! This isn 't an icer . These are real bullets . Damn it , fitz , shoot ! Aah ! Give me your hand ! Aah ! No ! Seal the tunnel . What ? ! What about mack ? ! That wasn 't mack . We 'll return in a moment . Update ? Ward 's mission was a success . He has raina . But ... There was a complication . He also took a hostage from the plane ... The S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent named skye . He said it was an insurance policy . Really ? How curious . I 'll have to ask about that when we join him . What 's more important is they shot the S.H.I.E.L.D. Plane down Once and for all . Actually , sir , ward let the plane go . That was not his decision to make . What are you waiting for ? Fix it . Bravo 4 . You have a go . Shoot them down . Repeat ... shoot them down .

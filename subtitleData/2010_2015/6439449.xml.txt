 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You did well . Pick it up . I hear you 've been looking for this . And only someone who can carry the Diviner is allowed to enter the city . Or , more importantly , the temple inside . Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D. And you an expert on the Diviner . Together , I think there 's much we can achieve . You know you 've lied to me ! This happens every time . We get closer , you get nervous ! Everything we 've been doing leads here . Ourjob , find it before anyone else . If there 's evidence of this city on Earth , the computer will find it . Hello ? Coulson ? Coulson ! Where 'd everybody go ? Coulson ! That sound . What is that ? Coulson , what 're you doing ? We have a mission to prep for . This is the mission . It opens . So weird , right ? No ! Sacrifices have to be made . Poison tree , poison fruit . I know . Bye , bye , angel eyes . No , wait . Wait , don 't leave her ! - Coulson , May , wait ! - Skye . Coulson ! Skye , wake up . Sorry I startled you . You okay ? I ... Yeah . I just dozed off . Grab your things . We 're back . Coming through . Coming through . Hey . Watch out . Watch out . Coming through . Coming through . Whoa ! Hey , hey , take it easy with that . I made that for Coulson . Wow . Hey , you know , if you 're looking for vacation time , bribery will get you nowhere . 'Cause I 've ... I 've tried . No , I 'm hoping he 'll let me work on the real thing . Brilliant . And , um , so how do you get it to fly ? - It doesn 't . - Oh . What ? Something wrong ? A storm 's coming . No , weather 's fine , actually . There 's not a cloud in the sky . I checked . No , never mind . You were looking for me ? Yeah , actually , um , I need to go to the plane ... What , you need help with the holographic towers ? - No , no , no , no , no . - With the descender rig ? What ... No , Simmons . I have to ... I have to give her a case , and then ... You know , at some point you 're gonna have to talk to her , right ? Good luck with the car . Hey ... You 're very lucky , Trip . If they hadn 't used that clotting agent on your wounds ... Well , let 's just say I 'm glad they did . I recommend a week of solid bed rest . Bed rest ? Where 's that in the S.H.I.E.L.D. handbook ? Whoa , stop it ! You 're going to rupture your sutures . I won 't be high-fiving anybody for a while . But I 'm okay , Jemma . There was a doctor in the house , remember ? So what was he like ? - Skye 's dad ? - Yes . That man was out of his damn ... Hey . Hi , Skye . Hey , yourself . Mission prep in five . Cargo Hold . Right . Roger that . Talking about my dad ? I 'm sorry . It must be so ... Messed up ? I was going to use the off-color version of " messed up , " but it felt inappropriate . Oh , it 's appropriate . My dad , Ward , the Obelisk , the city , it 's all messed up . And I just ... I can 't shake this vibe that something really bad is about to happen . You mean like someone getting shot ? Yeah , I got that covered already , so you can lose that vibe . We 're good . That 's right , yeah . Nothing but positive thoughts from here on out . That 's not wood , is it ? Here 's what we know . HYDRA 's on the move . They have the Obelisk and an expert who knows how to use it . We can 't let that happen . Obviously . Use it how ? Based on our latest intel , there 's something very powerful inside it . A weapon . Are we talking , uh , chemical , biological , energy-based ? Could be anything . It 's alien . While Simmons and I were undercover at HYDRA , Whitehall was looking to create an extinction-level event . To kill millions of people . We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that . Because bad guys love their WMDs . Trick is , to activate the Obelisk , HYDRA has to take it to a specific place . It 's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead ... Now , they need the lock . A temple inside the city . Any idea where this temple is ? Glad you asked . No . But it 's in the city , and we now know where that is . Even better , HYDRA doesn 't . Fitz ? On our mission to Australia , we hacked a military satellite network . Using that , we ran a multi-spectral , topographic scan of the Earth , miles deep , through the oceanic crust , looking to match ancient rock formations with the 3D model of the city . And we found this . Isn 't that in the Bermuda Triangle ? 'Cause that would explain a lot . Actually , it doesn 't have anything to do with the Triangle . We solved that back in the ' 80s . Ah , Atlantis ? Try Puerto Rico . These white markers represent vertical air shafts that are close to the surface . Possible entry points for the city . But most of them are under the ocean floor . Except for one , here , in old San Juan , where we 'll enter the underground city . A survey team will test the tunnel 's structural integrity , then locate the temple . And then what , sir ? We blow the hell out of it . What about the Obelisk ? It 's still dangerous all on its own . One crisis at a time . Come on , what do you mean you can 't break a $ 100 ? Sorry . Nothing over $ 20 . I 've changed my mind . I 'd like a chia water instead . - You got it , babe . Make it two . - Okay . I 've been thinking about our next trip . Maybe Shanghai ? You have expensive taste . And a wandering spirit . Be right back . Thank you . You know , Agent May , the whole point of embedding a tracker in somebody is that you don 't have to stalk them . Or did you just come by to say ... Hello , Raina . Doctor Whitehall would like a word . You 're gonna want to make your next right . Next right . Unless you wanna spend your last night on Earth in the Hotel HYDRA . - How ... - I 'll explain later . Come here , give me a hug . I 'm not hitting on you , okay ? I 'm S.H.I.E.L.D. , okay ? Just ... Stay close , stay quiet . Shh . Bye-bye , HYDRA . Okay . I 'm Agent Sam Koenig . Coulson sent me . Sorry , but you 're gonna need a lanyard . I 'm telling you , sir , she looked exactly like Agent May . Except for the freaky facial scar thing . That was Agent 33 . She was wearing a nanomask , disguised as May . But May electrocuted her right in the face . Oh , that is so badass . Sam , I 'm on with the Director . Thank you . You were saying , you think HYDRA was there to kidnap Raina , not kill her ? Well , we counted four 2-man teams , all non-tactical , all in full surveillance mode . And the freaky one told Raina that Whitehall wanted to talk . Question is , why ? And why now ? No idea , sir . But this is the first sighting we 've had of HYDRA since you let Raina out in the wild . Okay , I 'm sending Agent May with an extraction team . Sit tight until they get there . Copy that , sir . He 's sending The Cavalry ? Sweet ! Sam , what are you , 13 ? You can 't do a sit-up , you think you 're gonna hook up with The ... More news on the investigation of the horrific murder-suicide of Massachusetts Senator Christian Ward . FBI sources claim that while the Senator did leave a recorded confession , other evidence found at the scene suggests another party may have been involved . Meanwhile ... He did it . You know Ward did it . No doubt in my mind . The Senator should 've let us help . We tried . But he wanted nothing to do with us . All we can do now is try and catch Ward . Or put the son of a bitch down . Change of plans . We 're splitting up the teams . We 're going after Ward ? No , we 're not . HYDRA found Raina . Tried to grab her in Vancouver . Grab her ? Not kill her ? They 're grasping . HYDRA knows we 've found the city . Maybe they think she can help them . We 're pulling an extraction . And you 're leading it . I 'll head on to the city in the Quinjet with Bobbi , Mack , and Fitz-Simmons . We need to locate that temple . Wait , so you want me to go with them ? We 're all anxious to see the city . But I 'd like you to run point on Raina 's interrogation . I think she 'll respond to you . Yes , sir . I 'll spread the word . You don 't want Skye anywhere near that city , do you ? It 's not the city I 'm afraid of . It 's her lunatic father . Keep an eye on her , okay ? Of course , I 'm her S.O. Quinjet 's prepped . You almost ready ? Yeah , I was looking for the D.W.A.R.F. case . Well , ask Fitz . I 'm sure he 'll know . Ah . No , that 's all right . I 'm sure it 's around here somewhere . So how long were you two a thing ? A " thing " ? Fitz and I ? No . I mean , we never ... I ... I never dreamed ... Okay , I 'm just gonna stop you right there . 'Cause if this were an interrogation , you 'd have given me about nine visual cues to put you away . Maybe 10 . Look , I ... I know the story of what Ward did to you two . How Fitz 's brain was damaged . That 's not your issue , is it ? No . So what happened ? We were in the bottom of the ocean in a storage pod , left for dead . And Fitz , he said something that caught me completely off guard . Ah , those three little words . Yes ! Well , no . I mean , not exactly . I barely had a moment to process what he was saying , or how I felt about it . Next thing I know , he 's giving me the oxygen , water 's rushing in , and ... He 's ... He 's laying there , in a hospital bed . He was so pale . How long was Fitz in the coma ? Nine of the longest days of my life . And when it finally broke , he ... He couldn 't speak . He ... He just stared at me , confused . All I wanted to do was help him . All I wanted was my best friend back . Your best friend ? I never thought of him as anything else . That said , I can 't imagine my life without him . It 's all very confusing . You never told him any of this , have you ? Oh , Lord , no . Yeah , it 's tough . I wish I could give you some advice . But I 've never been friends with a guy first . It 's always been a roller coaster . Fast out of the gate . Hit the drop , the turn , the loop . The screeching halt . Then back in line to do it all over again . But is the ride worth it ? I 'll let you know when it 's over . You know , at the very least , you should be honest with him . If you don 't have trust ... Don 't die out there , okay ? It 's Canada . You two okay ? - Yeah , absolutely . - Ready when you are , sir . - Good , head on up . - Yeah . All right , time to go . I 'll see you in San Juan . See you there , sir . So you and Hunter . Again . - I know . - Hmm . - Been through it enough times ... - I know . Gluttons for punishment , I 'd say . Let 's not go down this road , okay ? You 're a big brother , but you 're not my big brother . Your personal life , that 's your business . I 'm just wondering if it means you 're bringing Hunter in on the other thing ? That ? No . I figured after we lost Hartley , you 'd try to ... No , he has no idea . And I 'd like it to stay that way . Copy that . Excuse me , mate . Somebody call an ambulance ! This guy just passed out ! - That was impressive . - Thanks , Billy . No , I 'm Sam . Billy 's the shorter one . Two more down . That 's not Sam 's knock . You two have a knock ? Yeah , we 're brothers , of course we have a knock . Lanyard , please . Agent Skye . Come on , Sam , you can 't just look through the damn peephole ? I 'm Billy . Sam 's the shorter one . Okay , right . Well , we need to move . Come on . Go for the stairs ! Stairs ! Copy ! Stand down , Agent 33 ! We can help you . I don 't need your help . There 's more coming . We need to ... What the hell is that ? May 's evil twin , formerly known as Agent 33 . And I thought the Koenigs were creepy . Tell Coulson we 're on our way . Yes , ma 'am . No tails on the way in . None that I could spot , anyway . Then we 're good . Have you ever had the fried plantains here ? Tostones ? Yeah , why ? I read about this place down the street where they put crab in ' em . I wouldn 't mind trying that . You know , after we save the world . Diego texted me . He 's gonna be late . He 's always late . He said he 'd meet us on the other side of the plaza . This contact of yours , can we trust him ? He 's a politician . So , no . But he likes me . And he can get us those architectural plans ? Yes , and he 'll keep the local cops off of us . Things could get sticky , depending on where we 're digging . Ooh , hats ! Wish I was a hat guy . Some guys can really pull that look off , you know ? What ? Too small ? You know , for a guy who 's about to blow up a chunk of an underground city , you don 't seem fazed . You have concerns . Just wanna make sure that we 're here to destroy that weapon , not recover it . Why would we do that ? That 's what Fury would do . I 'm not Fury . No , but he did hand you the keys to the kingdom for a reason . Look around you . Vendors selling their wares , bringing home a modest income . Locals buying fresh vegetables for dinner tonight . Tourists on their one vacation a year . Point ? They are the point . They 're the reason I 'm here . The reason there 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. There are three million people on this island , and I won 't let HYDRA turn them into collateral damage . With all due respect , sir , this kind of op , - Fury would have a number . - A number ? Of acceptable losses . My number 's zero . And for the record , I hate that phrase . That 's why I brought Fitz-Simmons . Not just to find the temple . But to assess its structural integrity . Minimize injury or destruction . Minimize destruction ? You really aren 't Fury , are you ? Come on , Bobbi . You ought to know me by now . I 'd rather use a scalpel than a shotgun . Well , it 's HYDRA . Might need the shotgun . Why do you think I brought you ? There 's Diego . I 'll be right back . Okay , I 'm gonna go check on the landing gear . What ? No , no , no . Wait , wait , wait . No , no . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Why ? Because the awkward silence in here is killing me . - I 'd like to say something ... - I 've been thinking ... - Please , let me go first . - No , I know . - There 's something I need to ... - I know ... No , I ... I know things have been difficult between us since I got back from being undercover , but I need you to understand that I didn 't leave because of what happened to you . No , no , no , no , Jemma , Jemma , please ! 'Cause I 've got a whole , um ... It 's hard enough to get the words out . I 've been thinking , and I 'm going to leave the lab . So you can be the one who runs the science division . You 're quitting ? No , I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm going to the garage . On the bus . With Mack . But why ? You know why . You 're clearly far more capable than I am . - At this point , anyway . - That 's not true ! You just need more time to heal and ... I 've had time . And I 'm ... I 'm not better . So you should run the lab . And I can work for you , I just can 't work with you . And I think that 's what 's best . The Fort of San Cristóbal . Held off the Dutch , the English , the Americans ... But apparently , not the aliens . Looks like your buddy , Diego , drew those plans . He got them from the city archives . They 're older than San Juan itself . According to Skye 's satellite spectrometry , there 's a vertical shaft under this fort . Yeah , it looks like it 's right at the water 's edge . Think we 'll get a better vantage point from up there . According to the map , the garrison is located underneath that sentry tower . That 's the deepest part of the fort . And inaccessible to the public . All the better for us . It won 't be easy to get equipment down there . Get a hold of Diego , see if he can help us out . We need to stay ahead of HYDRA . Even if HYDRA locates the city , how do you think they plan on unlocking the Obelisk ? I mean , nobody can even touch the damn thing . That we know of . Corner . Two men wearing classic HYDRA black , trying desperately hard not to look conspicuous . And failing . Where 's May ? Good question . I 'll go check . S.H.I.E.L.D. must be quite happy . Your plan of dangling me like bait seemed to work . I thought Whitehall wanted to kill you , not kidnap you . Something must 've changed his mind . Maybe he thinks you know something about the Obelisk . How it works . Are you saying Whitehall has the Diviner ? Someone give that girl a new flower dress . Well , that changes things . How so ? They don 't wanna kill me . They need me . Need you for what ? I can hold the Diviner . You mean , the thing that turns people to stone , you can touch it ? You don 't believe me . Honestly ? Everything that we 've been through , I don 't know what to believe anymore . When you hold it , these symbols appear . There 's a pull to them . Like a sense of where the Diviner belongs . Sounds a little Harry Potterto me . It 's alien technology . The Diviner reads your DNA to determine if you 're worthy of its power . You 'll understand when you touch it . No , thanks . I 'd rather not die just yet . You wouldn 't . Not according to your father . He believes you 're worthy , too . Listen . If you think you 're gonna trick me into touching that thing , you 're as crazy as he is . It 's not crazy . It 's our destiny . I 'm over here ! I 'm over here ! - Found May . - Get in . They 've got her , sir . I 'm sorry . But she did mention that they implanted a tracker in her . How fortunate . I 'll get my best man on it right away . So what happened to Agent 33 ? You guys just left her there ? We had to . HYDRA was closing in . We almost didn 't make it out . I wonder if that 's weird for May ? How do you mean ? Someone else having your face like that . It 's just creepy . Hey , Trip . How 's the shoulder ? Uh , it 's getting better , thanks . We were talking about Agent 33 . Ooh , with the freaky , fried May face ? Yeah , and the scary robot voice . Oh , " Crush ! Kill ! Destroy ! " Ow . Lost in Space ? TV show ? You ... Is there something in my teeth ? What ? No , no . No , I was , um ... I was just wondering , how many of you are there anyway ? Brothers , I mean . Thirteen . Thirteen ? Look at him . He fell for it . Yeah . That gets people every time . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you ... You got me . You got me good . Yes , the extraction was a success . Skye 's with Raina now . How big was the HYDRA contingent ? Not big enough . But they sent Agent 33 to take point . You know she still has my face ? I heard . Lucky her . Any theories why they came so hard at Raina ? Skye has one . Raina claims that she can touch the Obelisk without being harmed . Said that it would lead them to the temple . You believe her ? Skye does . You were right about Raina opening up to her . Have her stay at it . See if Skye can get me any recon on that temple . Copy that . Where 'd your friend , Diego , go ? He won 't go down to the garrison . Turns out he 's afraid of the legend . What legend ? They call it La Garita del Diablo . The Devil 's Sentry . Delightful . Yeah . The fort was built in the 18th century , and helped repel some of our British ancestors when they tried to invade the island . But this particular guard tower was built in 1634 . And is well-known as being haunted . That 's a deep hole . And haunted , apparently . You 're not scared of ghosts , though , are you , Mack ? Me ? Of course not . But what ... What was that story ? The story is , several of the guards went missing in the middle of the night from this tower , never to be seen again . They simply vanished . It 's all preposterous , really . Yeah . About as preposterous as an alien city . How 's it coming ? Uh ... Um , well , you should , um ... Why don 't you ... - No , it 's all right , you go first . - No , that 's fine . - Fitz , this is your ... - I know , but you 've ... Someone start talking . Uh , yeah , we 're ready to deploy , sir . - Would you like me to ... - No , no . Um ... How long will it take to survey the tunnel and locate the temple ? Uh , depends on several factors , like the ... - Don 't look at me . - Uh ... Hmm . The , um ... The ... - Tectonic stress levels ? - Tectonic stress levels , yes . And the structural ... Structural integrity of the tunnels , how damaged they are . How ... And how deep they go . How will you know what the temple looks like ? Well , we 'll know when we see it , I guess . We 'll be depending entirely on the data the D.W.A.R.F.s send us . - What just happened ? - Uh ... Uh , the tablet 's still working . Looks like they just went out . My very own S.H.I.E.L.D. ID . We match . I 'm sorry for trying to run . I just got swept up in the moment . You 're lucky Coulson 's the forgiving type . Actually , I feel very lucky we found each other . Your father 's told me so much about you . That 's funny , since I 've never met him . Of course you have . When you were born . Did you know he actually delivered you ? That 's sweet . He also killed a whole bunch of people . He almost killed my friend , Trip . Does he get emotional ? Yes . Violent , even ? Yes . But he 's also quite misunderstood . Then help me understand him . Where did you two meet ? Thailand . I was just a petty con artist , scamming tourists . Running with a bunch of " freaks , " as we liked to call ourselves . My father was one of your " freaks " ? No . He took us in . Cleaned us up . Showed us we weren 't freaks at all . Before I met your father , I was a lost soul with no clue of where I belonged . The daughter he never had . No . No one could ever replace you , Skye . You 're all he wants . All right , let 's get some light down there . Eyeballing it , it looks at least 100 feet . That 's all right . I 'm not scared of heights . The dark , however ... Just get those D.W.A.R.F.s back online . Otherwise we 're blind down there . Well , sir , it might not just be the D.W.A.R.F.s. Could be all electronics . Be honest , Skye . Haven 't you ever felt lost ? Or had that feeling that you were part of something bigger ? Like you were special ? When you say " special , " what you really mean is " alien . " Is that what you believe ? We 're human , Skye . We just have the potential to be more . But the Diviner , now that is most definitely alien . Where do you get this stuff ? My father ? Partly . But my grandmother came from a long line of special people who believed in a story about the blue angels that fell from the heavens . The ancients called them the Kree . And what did the Kree want ? Change . That 's why they left the Diviner , as a guide to the temple , so the worthy would inherit the Earth . And do you know where this temple is ? That 's what the Diviner shows you . Only the worthy are allowed inside to witness its true power . And what happens to the people who aren 't worthy ? I hope they 've said their goodbyes . Three pulls on the cable means " help , " got it ? Yes , sir . Let me down easy , Turbo . Please be careful . We can 't let them go down there , May . We have to stop them . Calm down . You can 't let Raina get into your head . She 's not lying . Look . She said the Diviner was meant to guide the worthy to the temple . You see this ? It 's the same symbol I saw on the Obelisk . It 's got to be the temple . You 're sure ? Trust me , it is seared into my brain . We have to warn Coulson now . Something bad is about to happen . Damn it ! Why isn 't this working ? Getting some kind of interference . S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 , do not engage your defenses or you will be shot out of the sky . Whitehall . There 's HYDRA Quinjets outside the windows on both sides . Then let 's step on it , shall we ? You have someone aboard that I want . A woman named Raina . I 'm going to send over a representative to get her . Any attempt to evade or retaliate will be met with hostile fire . Uncloak and prepare to be boarded . Destiny calls . I hit bottom . Copy ? Hey , I hit bottom ! Okay . - Get him up now ! - I 'm trying ! It 's at max power ! Well , he 's struggling on the line ! Before the D.W.A.R.F.s went down , they scanned for signs of life . All readings were negative . Wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! I can see him , he 's coming up . Hang on ! Get the harness off him ! Hey , talk to me , Mack . Mack ! - Mack ! - Okay . - Mack ! - What happened ? Were you attacked ? I don 't see any wounds , or signs of blood . Mack ! What did you say ? I can 't hear you . Run . Coulson ! I 'm not going to give up the lives of everyone on this plane for Raina . She 's not worth it . HYDRA already has the Obelisk . If they have Raina , too ... We still have the edge . Coulson 's already on site , HYDRA 's not . How the hell did they find us ? We were cloaked . Raina 's tracker . Old frequency S.H.I.E.L.D. used during the Cold War . What can I say , I 'm a history buff . Lower your weapons . Anyone shoots , the plane goes down . We all die . - Maybe it 's worth it . - Let 's not get carried away just yet . First you gave us Bakshi , now you 're back with HYDRA ? Pick a side , Ward . Oh , I have . Don 't worry . Let 's go . With pleasure . You too . What ? I made you a promise , Skye . I 'm here to keep it . You 're coming with us . The hell she is . Snap out of it , Mack ! I don 't wanna hurt you ! Fitz , ICER ! He 's not going down . Why isn 't he going down ? She 's not going anywhere . May . - She comes or the deal 's off . - Shut up . - May , if I don 't go with him ... - Don 't . ... he 's gonna blow this plane to pieces . They 're HYDRA . They 'll do it anyway . You can 't trust him , Skye . Yes , you can . Skye , look at me . Don 't talk to her . Skye , I give you my word . Come with me , we won 't fire a single shot . Everyone gets out alive . Good one . Is that what you told my brother before you killed him ? How many of you are there ? Skye , you can 't . There 's no other way . You know that . Whatever happens , I can handle myself . Oh , Skye , don 't forget your tablet . You know , the one with the map of the city on it . Mack , it 's me . Coulson ! Ahhh ! Please , Mack , wake up . Don 't make me do this . I got you . Shoot him , Fitz . This isn 't an ICER . These are real bullets . Damn it , Fitz , shoot ! Give me your hand ! No ! Seal the tunnel . What ? What about Mack ? That wasn 't Mack . Update ? Ward 's mission was a success . He has Raina . But there was a complication . Go on . He also took a hostage from the plane . The S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Skye . He said it was an insurance policy . Really ? How curious . I 'll have to ask about that when we join him . What 's more important is they shot the S.H.I.E.L.D. plane down once and for all . Actually , sir , Ward let the plane go . That was not his decision to make . What are you waiting for ? Fix it . Bravo Four , you have a go . Shoot them down . Repeat . Shoot them down .

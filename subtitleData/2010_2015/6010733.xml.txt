We made it explicitly clear to you that we 're no longer using sleeper agents . Tell me something , President Patel . Do you have children ? I 'm not the one being reviewed here .

I understand , it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do . I understand that perfectly . But when they come for your house ... or the house you built for your children , .. and your children 's children ... It won 't be PR and campaign promises that keep them out . It will be me !

A coup ? Are you suggesting a coup ? Is it possible ? I could write a reboot sequence . It 'd shut down the entire system , and at that point ... you can encode a new President , yes . Then that is what you will do . And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years . Missile Defense Batteries , Droids , everything we need , to protect our liberty . all guaranteed , of course , by your new President . Go ! Get to work , Mr. Carlyle .

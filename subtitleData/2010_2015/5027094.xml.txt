 Previously , on Touch ... A cipher . An algorithmic tool for sending and interpreting messages . This amulet , whosoever possesses it shall become the protector of the 36 righteous ones . - Jake , what 's happening ? - They 're dying . The procedure is perfectly safe . We put these people into medical coma . I 'm not sure " safe " is the word that I would use . At 11 : 00 on Thursday our company will release its quarterly report , and the world will see a $ 40 billion loss . Mr. Bohm , why is it every time I see you , someone has died ? Turns out a vendor at the farmer 's market gave a description of a Hassidic man in his 40s being dragged into a van yesterday . He was abducted ? Why haven 't you brought in the boy ? I found you . You said you were close . - They can 't have gone far . - I don 't care what you have to do , you get them ! It 's happening . What , sweetheart ? What 's happening ? It 's okay . You 're okay . - Wh-Where am I ? - In the E.R. You 're gonna be fine ; just a concussion . We called back the last number you dialed on your cell , so your friend 's been waiting for you to wake up for a couple hours . M-My friend ? How the hell did I get here ? Car accident . They say it was a hit-and-run . My son Jake , is he all right ? I 'm sorry ? My son , he was in the car with me . Sir , you were alone . Look ... I need to find my son . - I need to find my son . - Settle down . - I got to find my son ! I got to find my ... - Settle down . Okay ! Okay , I 'll go ask ! - I got to find him ! - Wait here ! Doctor ! Patient in 318 says there was ... - Whoa , not so fast . - Where 's Jake and Amelia ? - They weren 't in the car . - Get my stuff . - We need to call the police . - Trevor , please , I need your help . Get my stuff . So , where now ? - I don 't know . - Do you remember anything ? Nothing . The last thing I remember , Amelia looked up at me and she said , " It 's happening . " - What , the car crash ? - I don 't know . What is this ? " 318 . " J-Jake was writing numbers in the car before the accident . He must have put this in my pocket . Trevor , you need to take me back to my car . We need to go to the crash site . It 's not there . I drove past it a couple of hours ago on my way to the hospital , and it was being towed . We need to find out where they took it . Pier 17 . Thank you . They just cleared security . They 'll be here momentarily . This is madness , you know that ? Lawrence ... what did Gretzky always say ? You skate toward where the puck is going . This isn 't a game , Nicole . We 're about to announce a $ 40 billion shortfall tomorrow . You know how this works- - The stock 's gonna tank , and then next quarter we 'll be down $ 80 billion . This is where it starts . - Trust me , we are not too big to fail . - This is not going to happen . We have hundreds of trades lined up for the morning when the markets open . All we have to do is punch in the algorithm key and we 're home free . You 're really gonna pin this company 's entire future on a sequence of numbers ? A sequence that can predict patterns with 100 % accuracy ? Yes . $ 40 billion is nothing . We get the right sequence , Aster Corps could control the entire global economy . They 're here . I have your delivery . And the boy 's father ? You didn 't pay me for the father . They took him to the hospital . And-and if and when he gets out ? Say the word . Never mind , I 'll take care of it . I know you guys are really scared . But I want you to know that we 're gonna take very good care of you . All right , Jake ? It 's okay , Jake . Don 't worry . I have a plan . Out . Now . We get everything out of that sleep assessment facility ? Everything burned or shredded . Nothing in that location that can link to Aster Corps . Yes , well , as long as there 's an investigation , we 're all vulnerable . - Meaning what ? - Meaning ... we 're suggesting that you consider disappearing . No one disappears me , Ms. Farington . Don 't even think about pinning this on me . Better keep an eye on this . My God , this has gotten insane . As chief counsel of this company , I have to advise you against all of this . Are you coming or not ? The quarterly report comes out tomorrow morning , one way or another . So ... no . You just don 't have any fight left in you , do you , buddy ? Hello ? I thought you 'd like to know , we have new test subjects . You found more ? We have the ones we 've been waiting for . I 'm assuming you 're with us ? - Yeah . - Pier 17 . The Leviathan . Okay . You 're gonna make it , Will . Hang in there . I 'll be back . Okay , thank you . Far as they know , the car 's not a crime scene , so all they need to see is your I.D. and they can run the registration . - The car 's not mine . - What ? It belonged to a guy named Randall Meade . He gave it to me . - A car ? - It 's a long story . Well , how are we supposed to get in ? How much money you got ? - I 'm adding this to your tab . - Yeah . Excuse me . Can I speak to you ? You were lucky to get out alive . That 's the one thing I don 't understand- - Why they didn 't kill me . Maybe they thought you were dead . Maybe . Well , right now , I 'm the last guy they want walking around . Were you wearing gloves last night ? No . Come on . I 've got an idea . Down the stairs . Well , glad you could make it . Is there a problem ? No , no problem . Let 's get started . 2x13 Leviathan ReSync for WEB-DL by lost0ne The rebbe will see you now . - The rebbe ? - Mm-hmm . Nope . Nope . That won 't be necessary . You have meddled with the primal forces of nature , Avram Hadar . Rebbe , I only ... There cannot be 36 righteous people if an outside force is meddling with their destiny . They must not have awareness . They must not cohabitate . They must not come to possess powerful artifacts because their power can betray them . Hmm ? Can turn them into instruments of death instead . You know of what I speak , do you not ? A device forged in the name of healing , which has been misused and desecrated in the name of evil . Your purpose was to observe , to ... report , to pray . Instead , you have chosen to guide , to direct ... to persuade . And so these actions have had consequences . With all due respect , Rebbe , I think that you are wrong . - Oh . - I ... believe that the covenant of the 36 was meant to ... live , breathe , grow . I believe that the bylaws which govern them have changed , - as humankind has changed . - Ah , I see . So then we have , uh , hit an evolutionary speed bump of sorts . Yes ? Uh , like your pinky toe , is that it ? Yes . Yes , Rebbe , th-there is one instrument in particular , a young boy named Jacob Bohm . - He is special . He is not ... - There is no special ! So this only goes to prove that you have grown too close to the 36 . You have lost your perspective . You know , there is a sequence , one that binds and connects all life , huh ? Yes . But it is not complete . We don 't know how or even if - it ends . - Really ? A-Are you saying that ... we have found the entirety of it ? - The whole sequence ? - Please . A fingerprint on the inside of a glove . Unbelievable . Just turned it inside out , applied the ninhydrin heptane and bam- - big , fat , juicy latent . Real clean , too . Yeah , matched over 30 points . Would 've had an I.D. sooner , but the system got fooled by the number of hits . - Hits ? - Aliases . Over here . Five of them , to be exact . All deep cover , fully documented- - Social Security numbers , addresses , tax I.D.s , the works . See , the whole trick to an alias is to stay just respectable enough to make it look legit . See , and that 's where they screw up . They end up using a real address . Detective Lange . Yeah , I 'll hold for him . Got it . James Turner , James Taney , Joseph T ... Joseph Tanner , 318 Ridgeley Avenue- - that 's our guy . 318 . - Incredible . - Martin . Yeah . That was my C.O. Told me your bail has been revoked . - What ? Why ? - Didn 't say . Maybe someone from really high up made a phone call . Either way , I 'm supposed to arrest you again . I just got an address . I think I can find my son . Then I suggest you hurry up and check it out . And when I come looking for you , if you just happened to lead me to some bad guys then , uh , lucky me . Thank you , Detective . Thank you . Let 's go . Unbelievable . It 's incredible . But , Rebbe , this means ... Yes . And today the world will know it , too . As you say , things change . And humanity must be permitted to move forward . Either that or it 's the end of everything . So we do not know which ? Perhaps these things might not have been set in motion for a few thousand years had you been capable of more restraint . But if ... as you say , it all ends today , then this boy Jake is in danger . Rebbe , he could die . If Jacob Bohm is an instrument of God , then that is all he is . And , yes , he may die . That is not acceptable ! Listen to yourself . Who are you to tell God what is acceptable ? And in the meantime , God has chosen today to be the day of enlightenment . You will remain here from sunrise to sunset under my supervision . You will appreciate what it is to be an observer and not a participant . You will sit ! Sit ! Until you learn your place . Come on . You guys sit here . Everything 's gonna be okay , Jake . Trust me . Just be ready for my signal . The sequence is based on repeating chains called orbifolds that cycle off the Fibonacci sequence . Integers of seven . So my calculations have it wrapping back to the beginning to 318 in eight more digits . - How long will that take ? - How much time do we have ? First thing tomorrow morning . Well , then we need to accelerate the process . - Accelerate how ? - Through induced coma . Coma ? No . It 's a tested method , Calvin . And proven to kill . - That 's how Dr. McCormick died . - And I understand that your brother is about to join him . You don 't know anything about my brother . I understand that you feel responsible for his accident . I also understand that the completed sequence will tell you exactly which pathways to choose so that you can heal him . Calvin ? Look , I can bring the test subjects down to an alpha state - and achieve the same results ... - No , no , no , no , no . That 'll take days . Maybe weeks . Look , you want to save your company ? Just let me do my job , okay ? If he wants to serve them milk and cookies afterwards , that 's fine . That 's fine by me . It would be a shame to lose your brother now . After everything you 've done . I see it now , Jake . There 's an 84 % chance Calvin will help us escape . You ready ? Now . Help ! Please ! Help ! Please help ! Please ! Help ! Please ! Please help us ! What 's happening ? Why did he do that ? Why did he do that ? Just try to keep him calm , would you , please ? What 's happening ? Is my brother okay ? No , I already know what Dr. Milken is gonna say . I don 't care . If we have to intubate , then we intubate ! We take every measure to make sure he stays alive , okay ? If anything changes , you call me . You watch the front . I 'll make sure the rest of the house is clear . No one 's home . Place looks like nobody lives here . Yeah . Let 's start going through everything . Trevor . Shh . Shh . You picked the wrong house to rob . Help me put him in the chair . I 'm not comfortable with this , Martin . You need to step outside , I understand . I 'll see if any of these keys open the lockbox . Where are the kids ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Wrong answer . - No . Wrong guy . - I got it . - Good . Where 's my son ? You 'll never find him . Where is my son ? ! I want my son back ! I want my son back ! I want my son back ! - Martin , stop ! Stop ! - I want my son back ! - I want my son back ! - Martin , shut up ! He 's not breathing . Martin , he 's wearing a wire . Let 's go . Martin ? Look at this- - Memory cards . Looks like he 's recorded every conversation he 's ever had . All catalogued by date and time . This one starts ... - two weeks ago . - Why 'd you make these recordings ? Insurance policy . This one 's marked the day Lucy died . Play it . Ms. Farington , we 've spotted Lucy Robbins ' vehicle . - Is Amelia with her ? - Unclear . How should we proceed ? We only need the girl . The mother 's a liability . Get rid of her . Make it clean . Understood . You killed her . You son a bitch , you killed her . - No , not me . - That was your voice . I don 't get my hands dirty . I didn 't shoot her . I just relayed the order . I don 't get my hands dirty . I didn 't shoot her . I just relayed the order . Well , look at that . This thing works pretty good . Looks like your insurance policy 's kind of a double-edged sword . Well , at least it will be when it plays in court . - I 'm not going down for this . - All I want are the kids back . I gave them to Farington . Pier 17 , San Pedro , next to a tanker . Nicole Farington , the CEO of Aster Corps ? That 's her . That 's all I needed to hear . You son of a bitch . What do we do now ? I 've got an idea . Can I please speak to Detective Lange ? - All right , just send it up here . - All right . - Hey there . - What 's up ? Jake , what are you doing ? Come with me . Go downstairs . Where 's the exit ? I think I saw a way out down here . Hey ! Calvin ? ! Hey , what are you doing ? - I thought you were watching these guys . - I was watching them . We 've been looking all over for you . Yeah , I 've been looking for you , as well , okay ? Let 's stop pointing fingers . - Come on , let 's go . - Come on . It 's not safe for you out here . Come on . - Come on , go with him . - Come on . Come on . It 's not safe out here . Trevor , go ahead . My mate at the EPA just faxed over the inspection order to the harbor master 's officer . You 're Martin Bishop , EPA inspector , checking on sulfur levels in the fuel load . What if they want more details ? Oh . Every ocean-going vessel has to comply with environmental standards . They have no choice but to let you on board . Okay , got it . Thanks . It 's happening . I have clearance and authority to board this ship . - All right , go ahead . - Thank you . This is great . - The engine room- - where is the engine room ? - Through there . Attention . All hands , prepare to weigh anchor in 10 minutes . Departure time : 10 minutes . Jake . Something 's wrong . I can 't feel things the way I should be able to . Why 'd the engine stop ? I don 't know . What 's going on ? Never mind . Where are we ? Uh ... comas are fully induced , blood pressure 60 / 50 , both pulse rates are below 48 . It 's working just like I thought it would . The sequence is completing . I 'm sorry , I can 't stay with you anymore . Okay , I have to go . - I got to go , okay ? - I don 't understand , why ? Why are you leaving ? I 'm so sorry , Jake . - You got to be strong , okay ? - No , don 't leave . - I 'm so sorry , I have to . - Please don 't go . You gonna be okay . No , no . Come back . Oh , no . Amelia . - Where are you going ? - I have to stop this . No , you 're not stopping anything , not for her , not for anybody . - This could kill her . - You stop this , it 's gonna kill your brother . Now get back here . It 's finishing . The sequence is complete . How did he get in here ? Go get rid of him . Get rid of him . Go , go , go . It 's not going to be too easy . - Somebody 's trying to breach the room . Call security . - What ? Security . - Security . - Shut it down . - Shut it down . - Stop , stop , stop . - Someone just entered the lab . - Step away from my son ! - Stop , stop right there . - Security ! Get away from my son now ! You shot me . - Martin . - Calvin , you shut this down now or so help me , God , I 'll kill you . Shut it down now ! Amelia . What 's happening ? We 're losing her . Amelia . He 's still breathing . Jake , come on , buddy , wake up , Jake . Please , wake up . We 'll get the algorithm . Jake , it 's your dad , I 'm right here . Wake up . Oh , sweetie . It 's gonna be all right . Jake ... It 's all right , it 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . It 's all right . What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? ! - Please , Martin . I can bring her back . But I have to do it now . You better not be lying to me . Amelia . It 's all right , sweetie . Just breathe . It 's all right . Breathe . What the hell is going on ? Larry . I don 't have access . Yes , Nicole , I know . We 're gonna get you out of here , okay ? Just breathe . Ms. Farington ? I suggest you turn on the news . - Larry , what 's he talking about ? - Nicole ... I begged you to keep your distance from this . You 're gonna pay for everything you 've done . Ms. Farington , we 've spotted Lucy Robbins ' vehicle . - Is Amelia with her ? - Unclear . - How should we proceed ? - We only need the girl . The mother 's a liability . Get rid of her . Make it clean . Ms. Farington ? I have a warrant for your arrest . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law . It 's all right , sweetheart . I got you . Rebbe ? Please , may I go now ? I 'm going to return to my work in Brooklyn . You are right . I have meddled . I may have caused things to evolve in ways that I can 't ... You may see yourself out . Thank you , Rebbe . William , we did it . I got it . Nurse . Somebody ! Help ! - Mr. Norburg . - Where is he ? My brother ? - Mr. Norburg , we tried to reach you again , but ... - What ? But what ? But what ? ! What , he 's dead ? I am so sorry . That 's all I need for now , - but you 'll have to wait for the detective . - Thank you . Excuse me . I 'm fine . How you feeling , sweetheart ? A little weak . You 're so strong ... and brave , both of you . So , what happens now ? We get our lives back . We start over . I 'm gonna keep looking for your father . But you 'll stay with us until I find him , now matter how long it takes . Is that okay ? Yes , thank you . These people , they can 't hurt you anymore . But you already know that , don 't you ? What is it ? What is it ? It 's gone . The probabilities . I can 't see them anymore . Martin Bohm ! It 's all right , I 'll be right back . It doesn 't happen very often , but everything you 've told me is true . It tracked . You 're free to go . Thank you . Detective , there 's one more thing . There are infinite ways to communicate . Some better than others . Calvin Norburg . I 'm here to arrest you . I never meant to hurt anybody . I just wanted my brother back . Yeah . Signals , signs , patterns , mathematical in design . All around us . You just have to know how to see them . How we read these subtle cues , determines the course of our lives . Language is considered the ultimate form of communication , designed to optimize our connection to each other . Federal authorities estimate fraud allegations could total billions of dollars . But the charges of kidnapping and torture rank the CEO of Aster Corps , Nicole Farington , among the most notorious criminals in the history of corporate America . Today , the average person will say 2,520 words to 7.4 other individuals . Yet change the language , one border to the next , and we are hopeless . Stumbling to explain the simplest of concepts : " I want . " " I am . " " I love . " This is the letter that Mommy wrote to you . " Dearest Jake , " I want you to know that if I could , " I would always be there with you . " I love you so much . " I always want you to know " how brave and special you are . A thousand kisses , Mommy . " She 's right , you know . You 're the bravest person I know , Jake . And I 'm so proud of you . Come on , buddy . It 's time to go to sleep . Avram . Avram , my God . - What happened to you ? - It 's a long story , Martin . Uh , suffice it to say , I have been through the looking glass and back again , hopefully with a bit more wisdom . It 's over . Everything . The threat to Jake and Amelia , Aster Corps , it 's all over . Yes , yes , I know all about it . I have packed my bags . Why ? What do you mean ? I can no longer take part . I can 't . It 's not my place . I am going back to my own life . But first ... How did you get this ? Jake gave it to me . It wound up in his hands for a reason , just like the cipher . It 's meant to be carried by the protector of the 36 . Protector ? He 's not even 12 . Yes , he is very young . So I 'm giving it to you . For now , Martin , you are the protector . Good-bye , Martin Bohm . May God watch over you and your boy . Avram . Thank you for everything . Thank you for being my friend . Indeed . My name is Jake . I was born on October 26 , 2000 . I 've been alive for 11 years , nine months and 12 days . And in all that time , I 've only said a few words . But I 'm getting the hang of it now . And there 's a lot more I have to say .

And skip a possibility poisoned . Wear a mask and air lock doors . Ready to perform . - I will go . - No , you can not ... The last time I did CVL and I 'll be fine . Well , close the hatch and the Bay area and driveway , if it is not going to trigger a chain explosion there . There 's no pressure , then . Doctor , I need you to fuel space downstairs , slacking off a bit with enable emergency pump . Doing . You 're ready , Cameron ? Ready . When I opened the door the air , there will be a boost pressure of carbon monoxide . So turn off the flame as soon as possible . Understand . Cameron , do you hear ? Change ! That left only one outfit safety . Though burned , but can still be used . It 's too risky . Cameron , you can use a vacuum to suck the poison gas . We abort task or not ? I in air doors in Bay 3 . Anti-gravity is turned on . The clock is running . Let 's do it ! Do not act quasi-hero , if conditions do not allow , cancel and come back soon . 'll Handle . I will go . Will I opened the door and I put my entire air control you . Yes , sir . The door jammed , will not close again . The door can not close ! We have to cancel ? All will enter the entire station . The second key holder door . Continue mission . Report damage to me . I 'm still looking for it . Carbon monoksidanya very high . There is serious damage . Still looking for serious damage . Well , is the main protector . He ? should shut that place immediately . We had to close the filter and get you out of there soon . You see something here ? We could not see anything , you have to take care of themselves . In which part is hit by a meteor ? 9 and the filter appears facility . Meteor large enough . Wait a minute , I 'll try to answer it . Cameron ? Answered ! Cameron , do you hear ? I 'm still here . I want you to guide me how to turn it off . Right valve there is underneath . Valve on the bottom , right side .

It 's okay , I just need oxygen . - Come on ! - Wait . Bruce ! You have to see this . There is a kind of spores in it . Come on , you two , get out of here . What remains of this station just above the Bay . Come quickly ! Good , patron already closed , this alone only livable place . - You 're doing well . - Thank you . Lieutenant , we are exposed to chemicals of meteor showers . Lieutenant ! Good ! You too . - How is she ? - It 's okay . Close . 95 % off energy stations , back up power backup Flash ... - ... we have to get used to working in the dark . - At least for 72 hours . Control missions follow standard emergency procedures . It takes 92 hours to clean up this place , 92 hours sent people to help us . So we have to use the best possible time . Bagimana with rescue tubes ? It only holds 2 people , is not a good choice . We still have a gas leak problem , carbon monoxide levels above normal . Doctor ! John ! Carbon monoxide ( CO ) is a colorless , odorless . Poisonous , can create logical precautions such as hallucinations disorientation , headaches , irritability , impaired vision , - and death . - Good , plus more good news . - The solution ? - Be careful . We keep each other , if you look at the symptoms another friend Report to me as soon as possible . Understand ? Understand . Alright , I 'll try to clean up carbon monoxide . We can open Air filtration can be operated . Close the door . Danger , doors open air . Successfully , that 's good news . Has a low level of carbon monoxide . Bad news is we lost a bit of energy . - How to repair back panel ? - The circuit is broken . Shit . We really stuck . John , you 're an engineer , think how . Maybe we can still breathe . Lance , you turn off of medical equipment , it drained enough energy Okay . I would go . If the doctor can examine the meteor . Kind of spores that hatch . What do you mean kind of spores . It 's obviously something that can be contagious forms . If you were immediately quarantined , even pelindungpun not be a fun place . Priority now is to save yourself . - Do you understand ? - I did just that . Look , I can not take care of everything . If one person feels confused with abnormal symptoms such as dizziness , hallucinations , vision problems See me as soon as possible . Basic scientists ! Pengebornya machine will be turned off . Hopefully it can save electricity ! Ava , come here . You have to see this . You 've got the ingredients of the products ? Yes . Let 's see here . I 've never seen anything like this , shape natural and structural changes in the cell reproduces an incredible rate . What ? There is a mineral samples there . Why do not you analyze it and find the results . 's Headquarters in ARK , Colonel Braunchman to mission control , responsibility ! Maxim ? Are you there ? Can you hear me ? Maxim ? If you can hear me , I 've shut all mining activities . Power only for emergency lights . Please send rescuers . 's Headquarters in America , Colonel Braunchman to mission control , responsibility ? He 's doing sample diagnosis ? The results we get . Spore has its own media for cell regeneration no carbon monoxide , oxygen , hydrogen . It appears that light can trigger regeneration . Damn , this is really like you said . We just woke innocent . Can imitate , reproduce and nourish themselves . - As bacteria ? - Only more intelligent . Spores usually do not like it , and can not imitate other forms . I mean it can change shape , mutate , can move . Switching what ? Who knows , but its development is extraordinary . Could cell repair 100 times faster than cells in the human body . Are you okay ? Yes . I feel a little uncomfortable , I want to go first . - Hey . - Hey . Come drink first , slowly . I where ? In the healthcare space . Why are you two here ? What is it ? - Not , O Lord ! Not ! - It 's okay ! What 's wrong with my stomach ? Calm , Eva . Oh , God ! - Hey , what 's up ? - Relax ! Please you guys out there ! John , let 's go to the hall now . Okay , calm down ! Look at me . Listen ! You gotta breathe , Slowly . Calm . Calm . - Okay , I 'm here . - Okay . Ava , you have to listen to me . Understand ? Looks like you have been infected by the spores . Ava , listen , I can not explain it . I mean could not this fast . - Maybe . - Okay . They 're fighting over what ? - What ? - Gerard just a little confused , Calm yes . I would handle it through to completion . I promise . Do not worry about anything , get some rest . Come lie down . Okay . - I had to go . - Do not go . I 'll be right back , you 're safe here , do not worry . He wanted to lock him up . Lance , he should be quarantined . You have supported me . It was a strange disease , if there is not enough equipment , I can not check it . - Do you and he ... ? - Come on , pregnant 6 months within 24 hours ? give me a break . He was hit by an explosion chemicals , we need to find the cure for it . He must remain in the isolation room . I do not want to risk the safety of this station . You can not keep it , Colonel . He ? needs treatment . He infectious diseases . The rules must be isolated clearly 48 hours for observation . What if he dies in there ? You can access in there but the door must remain locked . Access is denied . Colonel , this protocol can not be accepted . I need access to Ava in 247 . Colonel , do you hear ? I was also concerned at Cameron just like you . As a commander , I 'm bound by the rules . He ? must remain in the isolation room . If you need anything just tell me . How about now . Look , I 'm not a medical doctor . But what could make transmission Form follows baby full organs . How can that be ? Diagnosis rational frequently confronted with abnormal symptoms . Not for cancer that could resemble pregnancy , It 's what we know doubt . But what if it is a poison to infect him either way ? Means we are in big trouble . - What is this ! - Oh my God ! - Do not touch him ! - He 's dying . Cameron , come on . Ava , wake up ! Do you hear me ? Come on . We got you . What is this thing ? Colonel , I need the lighting ! Bruce ! Approaching , give me light ! - What 's going on ? - I do not know , I found you had already fainted . Hey , he 's in a pinch . Quick fetch medicine cabinet . Everything ! We have to get out of here ! He will die if we do not do something . The room was officially included in the quarantine zone . You can not lock me in here ? Fixed lie ! Ava , let me help you ! I 'm not leaving . Why would you want to lock me in here ? What 's wrong with you ? Hey ! Bruce , go ! I would calm him . Colonel , you have no right here . I am a doctor in this place . Promptly report to me in the infirmary when you 're done . I 'll beat you , asshole ! Bastard ! No ! Come on ! Damn ! He 's infected , now you can also be infected . He ? has risked his life for us and this is how you repay me ? You just focus on improving communication then come back here And I 'll think about what to do . Until then ... - ... You have to follow my orders . - Sure . I just want to do this . Center , we would like to report any of the crew infected with toxic carbon monoxide . Our Captain ordered to confine Ava . Apparently the spores that have poisoned create a kind of Something strange . And we still do not know what it is . Here are 7 hours passed . It started feeling shiver . I want to get back to work . Here Bruce John , a machinery technician , headquarters in ARK . No ! Ava , are you doing ? Ava ! Ava ! Ava ! Let go ! Quiet ! Take him to the bed ! - Come on , Ava , quiet ! - Hold her ! No ! Please . - What 's the matter with you ? - Quiet ! John , we need your help ! - It bit me ! - What are you talking about ? - It bit me - Alright ! There is something here ! Hey , hey !

Nothing whatsoever ... . No , no , hear ! There is something here ... . Door there . I swear . Look Come on , take a look . I 'm going to lock it up . Tell me when it 's finished . Watch him , he may well have been exposed to toxins . Okay . There 's something in me . I feel it in my chest , okay . Something this , this creature , like sucking breasts Nothing is real , nothing at all , Ava . There 's nothing here , you understand ? You 're hallucinating . Okay . Lie down , I want to see cuts Bruce and I will be back again . Bruce , meet me in the treatment room , I want to see the wound . I know there 's something in here with me . I know you see it too . Could I give birth to something ? I do not know . Close your eyes , where young mothers aged 25 years . Oh God . Broken glass makes the wound is deep . Something has bitten me . Do not keep drinking it , can not it ? It can not help . Swear I saw something in there . Do you also hear sesuaut else ? You do not believe me . No , you and Ava experienced the same symptoms . Well , what if something using Ava to produce yourself ? This creature has no DNA . - You 're thinking about sports anymore ? - Come on , you admit it if that is possible . Once I had a chance to check on Ava symptoms , I can only make a decision . But until then , all still refer to on science and logic that can be accepted . There is nothing in the evidence room was sabagai . - I want you to rest , that 's an order . - Yes . Colonel wanted to re-connect communications . If you ask me , I can not open it . Antennae are destroyed . What the ... ? Damn ! John , what are you currently working on solar panels ? We need electricity . Come on , come on ! Gosh ! Okay . Solar Panels Cancellation Calibration Manual Come on . Solar Panels Automatic Calibration FAILED then . Solar Panels ON Calibration Manual Look , once we can fix the Komuikasi we can go from this place . John reported to me that the antenna was destroyed . How is she ? He should be in charge ? I need him . She makes me worry , he also experienced symptoms of paranoid . Hallucinations . He drunk a drink ? Loss of control , it was obvious that he suffered chemical explosion . I do not have adequate tools to treat him . Can not do a proper diagnosis . Doctor , if so now only left you and me . For now . I 'm not crazy . I 'm not crazy . I 'm not crazy ! O Lord ! I 'm not crazy ! I 'm not crazy ! I 'm not crazy ! John ? John ? John . Hey . John , heard . Enough . I want you to pull out the alcohol content in your body . After that I 'm going to treat you . You have to stop drinking , ok ? I want you to go back to your post . Come on . Damn . I knew it . What ? - What are you doing ? - I need to look at your fingers . What ? You have direct contact with the spores . Why did not you report it ? You know the drill . Yes , you always put rules over all , does not it , Colonel ? We have to follow the rules of this station guidelines . Guidelines station ? Mean treat your men who have risked their lives to rescue ? Fuck you . Cameron , to Dr. Krauss to know what happened to you . I have to do oversight . Mean locked ? If you do not let go , you will be in danger . I do not care about the threats . Once this is complete , you will be faced to a military court . I sure saw something . - It 's not a nightmare . - Cameron . If you do not let go , you will endanger everyone here . Cameron , none whatsoever . You were hallucinating . I have to put you in isolation . Back here . Off me . Colonel . Fuck ! Let me see . Yet finished . - Let 's do the examination . - Yes . What happened in the corridor ? Seems to have broken the chain of leadership . Bruce attacked . He 's gone mad . You 're looking for him . I want explanations . Damn , the door ! Bruce ? Ava ... Bruce ? Bruce ! I know you 're here . I 'm not afraid of you anymore . Oh God ! Damn ! What happened to me ? Damn ! What happened to me ! Damn ! Damn ! Cameron ? Come on , wake up . Do not mess around . Who let you go ? I 'm not going to let you hurt me . Ava , listen , I 'm not here to hurt you . That company rules . I have to lock you up . You 're not going to put me in jail There 's something happening here and you do not believe me . Please do not force me to do violence . No ! Not ! No ! What happened ? She shot . You lift him ! Quick . Come on . - Let me look at - Damn . Wait , wait . Okay . What ? What do you want ? Stop ! Stop ! What do you want ? Stop ! Okay . Got an answer for this ? Course . She threatened , against the guide line station . Rules are needed to isolate . He ? could not think straight . He is contaminated . Until you 're there without consulting me . So who 's releasing it ? Bruce ! Look I 've seen the video tape . Cameron hurt his finger while analyzing spores . You do not believe me ? Look right thumb . He infected . - What 's this ? - Alarm . I know what this is . But why ? As a precautionary measure only . Because I gave you antibiotics very hard . Hey . I have to protect myself . I 'm not crazy . Why did you hide it from me ? I 'm afraid . Something came out of my body , right ? Tell me . I see something here . I 'm not dreaming . You have to let me go . I can not do it . You 're making a big mistake . Ask Bruce ! Bruce , open the door ! Bruce ! Bruce opened the door . The out of body Ava Is here . I see it . This creature Talk to me . Mempelajariku . It drives me crazy . I guess I 'll be dead soon . Bruce ? Bruce ! Shit . Oh God . What happened ? Bruce . He tried to kill me . - When ? - Recent . A few minutes ago . Bruce was dead . Not possible . He was just here . Whatever you see , think again . Because it 's not Bruce . Colonel . There 's something in here with us . This variety is grown in Ava body and mimic the form Bruce . Both of them had been infected by spores . Using air vents To move . So we have to kill him . We need help Ava . Ava ? Bruce died . How do you know ? I could feel what he was doing . Ava , we need your help . You 're the only one who can control it . It 's not anymore . Initially he was using me for life , but now he 's also think of me as a threat . My guess is This creature took DNA Bruce . Knowing that men are physically stronger and imitate her for life . We still need your help . Can we trust you ? You can trust me . Here the base month ARK , code 184 . We have evidence of the existence of aliens . He uses the body of Lieutenant Cameron to grow . And now mimic human form . It attacked and tried to kill us . When berwjud still human , It would be easier to find . There 's something not right . Compressor 4 experienced a problem . Creature is trying to cut off our oxygen source . 3 ventilation does not respond . He 's trying to destroy the system . It does not make sense . This place is going to die with us . You tell rescue tubes at Bruce . So we are trying to disrupt the system . See what we can find him . I 'm coming with you . Compressor failed ! Give the lamp . Hose had been cut . Do you know how to fix it ? How . It 's the way . Come on , hurry , hurry ! Quick . What are you doing ? He was not trying to kill us . Ava . Set the position through me . - Cameron ! Stay with us ! - Ava ! Back . Bastard ! - Ava ! - Wait a minute . Danger ! Doors open air ! There was a system failure ! Hey , save Ava . I will try to close the door . It acts crazy ! We can not close the door from here ! Danger ! Doors open air ! There was a system failure ! Come on ! Danger ! Doors open air ! There was a system failure ! Give me your hand . Danger ! Doors open air ! There was a system failure ! System back to normal ! - No ! - System Locked ! Evacuation in 30 seconds . - Not . System locked ! Access Denied . Oh , hey ! I 'm locked in here . System locked ! Access Denied . - Try the system . Access is denied . - Try again . 10 . - It 's not working . 9 . 8 . - Shit . 7 . 6 . 5 . 4 . = = 3 . 2 . 1 . Oh God . He 's back . I can not stop . Let 's go to my room Bruce . Maybe he got the information . Come on . Come on , quickly ! O Lord ! I 'm Not Crazy - Damn ! He recorded many messages . This variety grows in the body of Ava . I can not reveal who the infected crew . I could not take the risk of entry into the isolation room . What is being done ... Cloning himself . I are gratified I 'm afraid he 'll come after me Maybe , if he 's in the original form . Maybe . Perhaps , if we are still in human form ... . ... It would be easier to kill . I think carbon monoxide . If you see this . The only way to survive is to go with a tube rescue . How long does it take for a rescue tube ? Too long . Unless ... We sacrifice the whole power station to fill the tube . Let 's do it . Hey . Once we do that , there will be no turning back . It 's the only chance . Then it should work . We need to prepare the tube . If the emergency doors begin to close this plug . It came back through here . Ava . We can do this . Okay . What 's in here . I 've turned on the engine . Turn off everything when it 's ready . I 'm right there . He 's back . - Oh God ! - Gosh - Sorry . - I can not see anything . - Everything all right ? - Electric power can reach 85 % when I got there . Come on , let 's go . - Come on . - I do not have lights . Good . Come on . Danger ! carbon monoxide levels 4 and on the rise ! Danger ! Decreased oxygen levels . This carbon monoksida.Ini unreasonable . In want to poison us all . That 's what he did on Bruce and now want to kill us . He opened the door of the air in the Bay 2 . Go to a rescue tube and prepare s . Hurry . Not . We have to stick together . I can not adjust the coordinates without you there . Go . Quick . Danger . oxygen content decreases . Carbon monoxide at levels 2 and rising . Fuck . This is it . Coordinates specified location . Ava , I 've turned on the launch . Input the code . Ava , did you hear ? Ava ? Carbon monoxide at level 3 . Launch in 3 minutes . It 's 80 % . Gerard . Down here . Danger ! Oxygen content decreases ! Gerard ! He 's down here ! In a rescue tube ! Launch within 2 minutes . Gerard ! Ava ! Breathe ! Log ! Launch within 1 minute . Bastard ! - It 's locked , we can not open it . - Damn ! We have to stop the launch . Open . Launch within 30 seconds . Come on , get inside . All the energy put Launch executed . Try cutting its energy supply . 'm Trying . 8 . 7 . 6 . 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Launched ! Damn ! We finished . All units die . Check emergency system . Come on . Oxygen Time For 17 minutes We have 17 minutes left . What is real ? This is Colonel Brauchman . I have some important news . We have lost contact with the control station all the earth . I need to send an emergency message to Captain Madsen . This is an important message from Colonel Brauchman . Answer ! - There will be a plane landing . - Oh God , come on time ! Flight landed . Do you think they will succeed ? 50 : 50 . If you stay here , hopefully they can come on time . Or we will lose half 3 minutes waiting for them to land . You can hold your breath for 3 minutes a half , is not it ? Yes . If tails , we wait . If head we will run out . Damn ! Come on ! Still no communication from headquarters month . Or to post that there will be a landing beacon . The door is certainly open for collision . There was no sign of life . No one else can get out of here , we can see traces . Rescuers will come tonight . Hopefully we will be able to answer . Until then , we keep this . - You 've already contacted the center ? - I 'm waiting for orders . Take the carcass of the tube to the base without public knowledge . Who will win in this case . Surely all television networks . Blockade this area . There should be no incoming or outgoing . Sir . You 've got to see this . Control mission , here Colonel Brauchman report of American space station . Madsen , whatever comes out of the tube kill instantly . Creature that is very dangerous . He ? has killed Klauss and John . Creature is a threat to mankind . Translated by : Matrixz

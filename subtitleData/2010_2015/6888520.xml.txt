 [ music playing ] NARRATOR : On the distant planet of Snerd , to enforce the prohibition of sexual activity , the government created the Limp-Tron 69 , a device that controls the planet 's gravitational pull . This causes the people to lose all interest in any sexual activity and renders their organs in a perpetual state of flaccidity . This gives the planetary government the ability to rule a sexless planet . However , this gravitational system does not work on all creatures . The Interplanetary Court of Morality is now in session . The Honorable Judge Melvin P. Enis presiding . Counselor , your clients are accused of being in direct violation of the planet 's strict rules prohibiting sexual acts of any kind . How do these things plead ? Not guilty , Your Honor . What ? Oh , no , no , no . [ grumble ] Oh . Your Honor , these three creatures are foreign to our planet . Their DNA is unaffected by the Limp-Tron 69 . Upon further research ... [ laughing ] Order ! I will have order ! I apologize , Your Honor . If I may continue ... You may not , counselor . There are vile and disgusting creatures , and I want to know nothing about them . Your Honor , they weren 't caught doing anything wrong . Their ship crashed on our planet during the DO Showers . It is my opinion we send them back home . Oh . Your opinion ? Your opinion means huggabaloo to me . I know exactly what they are and where they come from , and I 'm sentencing them to termination . Judge , you can 't sentence them to death just because of where they 're from . Is that right , Cass Coridore ? In that case , I find you guilty of being a sexual sympathizer , and I 'm sentencing you 10 Snerdian years of hard labor at the Third Moon Prison . For what ? Doing my job as a space lawyer ? Now it 's 20 Snerdian years . Maybe that will toughen you up and make you watch your queer mouth . [ laughing ] [ farting ] Oh , my . Oh ! Get them out of my face . Oh ! I hate the Chubbies . Oh ! Fucking perverts . [ beeping ] Yeah , this is Holy Driver 1 , requesting permission to engage off of Snerd . CONTROL : Oh , one moment , Holy Driver 1 . We have some late arrivals for you . What have we got ? Three turds and a piece of shit . Get in the cage . Where are they going ? I got deliveries to make . Straight to the Third Moon Prison Planet for termination . I 'm not to be terminated . Shut up , pedophile . I 'm not a pedophile . I 'm a lawyer . One more word out of you , and you 'll be kissing your own ass in your dreams . What does that even mean ? Oh , I 'm warning you , boy . ( WHISPERING ) Listen , I don 't think it 's fair what they 're going to do to you , so I 'm going to let you guys out . [ cough ] Got it . Pucker up , butterscotch . [ thud ] All right , are you done in here ? Oh , yeah , I 'm done . Then get the fuck off my ship . You don 't have to be rude about it . Beam ! This is Holy Driver 1 , requesting permission yet again to take off from Snerd to the Third Moon Prison Planet . CONTROL : Permission granted . Thanks , Pussy Lips . [ Chubbies snickering ] CHUBBY : Get this faggot . [ alarm blaring ] What are you doing ? Stop ! Hey , come back . Bye bye . I was trying to help you . I was trying to help you ! Fuck you ! [ glass breaking ] [ zapping ] Uh . Uh , this is Cass Coridore to Planet Snerd . The pilot 's dead . I don 't know how to fly a ship . The pilot 's dead . It looks like his dick has been eaten off . I didn 't eat his dick off . I think the Chubbies were the ones involved . They got loose . Uh , please send help . Send help . Help . Again , I did not bite his dick off . It was not me . Help ! Escape pod . Judge Enis . Oh , Judge Enis . Go away . I 'm busy . Those little creatures have escaped . I care not . They are en route to Planet Earth , oh . Oh ! Get me the General . The Chubbies must be destroyed . The Chubbies must be destroyed ! [ music playing ] [ indistinct chatter ] Sam . Sam , come here . I want you to check this video out . I found this brand new video store . They rent foreign imports . What ? Seriously ? Yeah , yeah . I got it queued up to the best spot . I heard it 's banned in America . [ scream ] And now , I 'm going to squirt my first load at you . [ scream ] What is this ? What the bowling ball is this ? I know . This is disgusting , Eddie . Why are we watching this ? What the hell are you guys doing ? Moody 's still here . Just watching a video , man . Moody doesn 't like this crap . Oh my god . Tom , get your ass in here . Shit . MOODY ( ON TV ) : Welcome to Moody 's Bowl-O-Rama ! We have more balls than any other bowling alley in the state . Bowling 's not your game ? Try pocket pool . Hey , kids , we have video games like Ms. Pac-Man and Caligula . [ knock on door ] Uh , you wanted to see me , Mr. Moody ? MOODY ( ON TV ) : We have new Coke . Tom . Have a seat . Would you care for a piece of candy ? Uh , no . I think I 'll pass . [ chuckle ] Now , as you know , it 's Halloween . So I have to get the fuck out of here , and I 'm leaving you in charge . Well , I 'm honored you trust me so much , Mr. Moody . I don 't . But you 're a little less retarded than the other idiots I have working here . Thanks all the same . Now , I know I don 't need to remind you , but if you or if any of your little faggot friends are in here past midnight , you 'll be locked in until I come back in the morning . Don 't worry , Mr. Moody . We 'll be out of here by 11 : 00 tops . Good , because I 'll be setting the security system when I leave . This sweet baby cost me an arm and a leg . State of the art in bowling alley security systems . [ beeping ] I 've got lasers on every door and every window . Guaranteed to keep the darkies out after dark . Once I put the code in this baby , we 're on lockdown . Well , don 't worry , Mr. Moody . You can count on me . [ beeping ] Well ? Get the hell out of here and run my bowling alley . I have got treats to pass out to the little kiddies . Yes , sir . Uh , Happy Halloween , Mr. Moody . You fucker . So long , Mr. Moody . Happy Halloween , pricks . I 've never seen Moody leave so quickly . Yeah , or happy . Ever . Moody hates kids . Why is he so excited for Halloween ? Because Halloween is the one day a year he can fuck with the neighborhood kids and get away with it . - Some beer . The kids , they think they 're going to prank him , but he always booby traps his own yard . The other year , some kids were going to egg his front porch . But he built this see-through trampoline thing that shot the eggs back , so the kids ended up egging themselves . - Beer ! And then the next year , they were going to TP that tree he has in his front yard . But he spent the entire year filling the tree with bats that he trained to attack at the sight of toilet paper . Fuck . Yeah . I heard he baked his own shit , and then wrapped the turds up in Tootsie Roll wrappers . That is why he loves Halloween , and tonight is the only night he leaves early . It 's also the same reason we 're going to have the Halloween party here tonight . Get with the fucking beer . You want your damn beer ? Here it comes . You want your fucking drink ? Here 's your fucking drink . Get the fuck out of my bar . Fuck ! I 'm soaking wet like a squid 's pussy . Ugh . Fuck ! I think I 'm in love . That chick would destroy you . Charlie , don 't smoke so much , man . Gotta save some for the party . Lay off me , baby . I had a bad day , you know ? My old man 's such a dick . He don 't understand me . Won 't you calm down ? Let me take care of you for a bit . Pfft , whatever . No one understands me . I understand you . You only understand my fat wank . [ unzipping ] [ moan ] Man . My old man is such a dick . You know , every day , he asks me , are you going to the Halloween party today , son ? He thinks it 's a real laugh riot the way I dress . Well , of all days holy , you know what he says to me on Halloween ? He says , are you going to the library tonight , son , to do some studying ? And I says to him , no , man , I 'm going to the Halloween party . What do you think about that ? And you know what he says to me ? Hm ? He says , have fun studying at the library , son . God , can you believe that bullshit ? [ ufo zipping by overhead ] Holy shit ! - Are you about to come ? - No . Stop sucking my dick . Look , I just saw a UFO crash . [ laugh ] You are so high . I 'm serious over here . Holy shit , there 's another one . Come on , let 's go check it out . No , I 'm not finished . And we gotta go to the Halloween party . You horny slut . Grab the video camera . Come on . We 'll tape this , and we 'll try selling it to the news . We can probably make like $ 500 , Maybe even more . Come on , let 's go . Fine . [ beeping ] [ coughing ] This is Cass Coridore . I seem to have landed on a Snerdian-like planet . Cass , this is General Teabag . Are the Chubbies with you ? No . They escaped in a pod . They have to be destroyed . I am handling it , Melvin . Cass , I know you 're just a simple space lawyer , and you 're just doing your job , but trust me , those Chubbies are dangerous . How dangerous are they ? Let 's just say that the people of Earth are a sexually driven species . The Chubbies know this . If they come in contact with an Earth human , they can use their body as an avatar by invading their anal cavity . Once inside , the Chubbies take over their body and can even spawn multiple Chubbies . If they succeed , they could invade every Earth anus in less than two Snerdian weeks . Would you like some space tea ? I 'm a bit thirsty . Yes , that 's fine . Dammit , Enis , I 'm in the middle of something important here . Well , my apologies . I 'll , uh ... I 'll get Rape Bot to bring me some tea . Rape Bot , tea , please . How do I find them ? Inside the escape pod should be two fully charged space laser guns , and your communicator doubles as a tracking device to locate them . It 's quite simple , really . What 's in this for me ? Enis sent me to a prison camp . And I 'll do it again , you little shit ! I outrank Enis on this planet . Cass , know that any charges brought against you will be dropped . And then we will send a ship to locate you and bring you back home . But only if you succeed . [ mechanical whirring ] Oh , oh , oh ! Rape Bot , get off of me ! Shit . Dammit , Enis . Why would you call in Rape Bot to bring you space tea ? I thought we reprogrammed him to be our butler . Rape Bot has one job , and business is good . Rape business . General . I 'll do it . Don 't let us down , Coridore . The fate of these two planets depends on you . Keep us updated . [ pew ] CHARLIE : Come on , baby . I don 't want to argue . Just follow the smoke . We 're almost there . RUTH ANNE : We 're trespassing . CHARLIE : So what ? We need the money anyway . You know , you really need to start respecting me more . I 'm out here , aren 't I ? Look , whatever , babe . Look , we 're going to make so much money off this stinkin ' UFO . We 're going to sell it to the news , hell , maybe even " Time " magazine . And then I 'll shove that video in my old man 's face and say , guess the world digs my videos , Dad . Happy Halloween . Holy dog shit . Aha , you see ? I told you there was a UFO . Go on , go on and start taping . Hold on . Let me get this thing working . Ruth Anne , I swear , if you ruin this for me , I 'll ... [ crunch ] What , Charlie ? You 'll do what , huh ? All right . It 's working . Taking video now . Stop having a temper tantrum . Charlie ? Charlie ? Oh my god . Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie ? [ gurgling ] [ fart ] I want to mostly get Butterfingers because that 's the best candy in the world , you know ? I can 't believe that last house gave us raisins . Who does that on Halloween ? Stupid old people . For sure . I hate it also when they like , serve granola bars . That 's not candy . I know . Why aren 't we stopping here , guys ? Dude , do you not know ? That 's Old Man Moody 's house . Yeah , we don 't want to stop here . Hey , let 's go across the street . There 's a house that gives away king-sized candy bars . You guys are being pussies . Halloween is about getting the most free candy you can . It 's not worth it , man . I 'm not afraid of some old dick . Just watch and learn . Trick or treat . Well , hello , little boy . And what are you supposed to be ? A gay cheetah ? No . I 'm the Goblin King . Well , of course , you are . I haven 't seen you around here before . Are you all by yourself ? My friends are on the sidewalk . Can we just get to the candy ? Ah , is that little Johnny Morgan and his brother Joey ? Hello , boys . Happy Halloween . Piss off , Moody . Yes , piss indeed . I got something for you , young man . See this football ? This became mine when your little friends kicked it into my yard last spring . I love it so much . I gave it to my kitty cat , Mr. Rumsfeld , to use as a urinal . It 's filled with cat piss . [ splashing ] There 's even a couple of Mr. Rumsfeld 's little turds in there for your added Halloween enjoyment . My candy 's ruined ! Happy Halloween , you little shithead . Come back next year . You 're all invited . Tell them Moody sent you . [ laugh ] Did you at least get our football back ? Screw you guys . [ muffled music playing ] Hello , Moody Jr . Are you done yet ? Everyone is almost here for the party . Listen , you little faggot . I 'm counting more money here than you 've ever seen in your life . Now get the fuck out of here , but get me a beer first . We should just take the money and run . I swear , that kind of money , we could open up our own bowling place and not have to answer to Moody . Where 's my beer , you little thief ? What are you supposed to be ? A gay swashbuckler ? Uh , no . I 'm obviously the Goblin King . You 're kidding , right ? I 'm obviously the Goblin King . Hey , guys . I could really use your help . People are starting to show up for the party . So are you just going to keep staring at my tits ? I 'm not . I mean ... shit , wait , what ? People are here for the party already ? I didn 't hear the bell . What door are they coming in ? The back door . Shit ! Hey , Sam . Uh ... nice costume . You too , Diamond Dave . Goblin King . You like my new tunes ? I love them . You 're so warm . I 'm so cold right now . I 'm such an idiot . I 'm barely wearing any clothes right now . I can warm you up . No problem . This door is off limits . Whoa . Sorry , dude . We saw the door was propped open and decided to come this way . Seriously , we have to leave it open at all times . Why ? Because Moody has a lockdown time , and it goes from midnight to 8 : 00 AM . And if this door 's closed at 11 : 49 , we 're not opening it at 12 : 01 . So whatever you need to do , we can 't get back in . You can 't go to your car . You can 't go to smoke . You can 't do anything until we all leave , OK ? What are you talking about , dude ? Nobody 's going outside to smoke when we have the inside . That 's fucking stupid . I 'm being serious , guys . OK , dude , we got it . Don 't close this door . OK , now let 's go party . Yes . Party time . Fine . I guess I 'll stay here and make a sign for the stragglers . [ music playing ] [ groaning ] CHUBBY : Hey , it 's dark in here . [ laugh ] Hey , hey , hey . Have you guys seen a Chubby tonight ? What the fuck did you just say to my kids ? I 'm just asking them if they 've seen a Chubby . You 're asking my kids if they 've seen your chubby ? Well , no . It 's not my Chubbies . I mean , I did try to get the Chubbies off . But now , I understand how dangerous they are . Listen , pal , you 're cruising for a bruising . Hey , I 'm just looking out for you people of Earth . The Chubbies are here to invade your anal cavity . That 's it , pal . [ thud ] All right , let 's get the fuck out of here . [ knock on door ] Trick or treat . Well , if it isn 't little Timmy from next door . I 've got something really special for you . I made these little treats with help of your doggie who likes to take dumps on my lawn every day . Make sure you share them with your parents . Thank you , Mr. Moody . Oh , you 're welcome . You enjoy those Tootsie Poops . I mean , Pops . [ laugh ] Trick or treat . Well , aren 't you a pretty little princess ? And who 's this ? Wonder Woman ? Well , girls , I 'm sorry , but Old Moody 's all out of treats . But I do have a trick . [ screaming ] Happy Halloween , you little brats . Come back and see Moody again next year . A nice little treat for me ? Don 't mind if I do . Ah , another successful Halloween for Mr. Moody . [ meow ] Well , let 's see what 's on the old boob tube . [ banjo playing on tv ] Halloween only comes once a year . Kind of like Mr. Moody . You 're not scared , ' cause I 'm Sheriff motherfucking Gary . [ gunshots ] [ music playing ] Shouldn 't Charlie and Ruth Anne be here by now ? They 're probably at Make Out Point getting high right now . Or Charlie got grounded by his pops . No way , man . Mr. Brewster 's the coolest . I don 't know why Charlie hates him so much . ( MOCKING ) ' Cause my old man just don 't understand me , man . Fuck you . [ laughter ] General , the President of the United States on Earth in 1986 is on the space communicator . Oh , mother of Snerd . Fork down , Enis . I have a long rapport with all the world leaders of Planet Earth . Put him through . [ static ] Mr. President , salutations . Just level with me . Just level with me . I don 't want to forget to duck . Is there any truth to the Chubbies invading ... invading our beautiful country in a thousand points of light ? Yes , Mr. President , it is true . But we have one of our best on a kill-all mission , so ... Good god , General , don 't you know that I 've got a lot to do ? We 've got to punish those homosexuals for getting AIDS , and we 've got the War on Drugs , General . I can 't go around worrying about an invasion ... an invasion . Please , Mr. Mars Man , tear down that satellite . Do not stress about this , Mr. President . It 'll get done . The three Chubbies will be disintegrated in no time . Well , I 'd hate to end our trade deal . I just love ... I love all those Snerdian jelly beans . Yeah , so does Nancy . And , you know , we do love your enriched uranium and your nerve gas . Oh , also oxygen . Yes , we cannot live without that oxygen , so , yeah , keep that coming . Very good , General . And God bless America . God bless Reaganomics . And did you get a chance to look at those videotapes I sent you ? Videotapes ? Uh . Oh ! Yes , the Hollywood movies featuring you and a monkey . Yes . Yes , that 's it . Yes , that 's it . President Nixon and I watched it together . We were on our knees , praying the whole time . [ awkward laugh ] Remarkable work , sir . It 's no wonder the people of America have elected you to be the supreme leader . Yes , there are plenty more videotapes where that came from , General . But you need to return them tomorrow because I 've got to send them back to the Pentagon . Their video collection is much in demand these days . Big missiles and heat-seeking , wet , lushness , hard missiles . Yeah . You know ... Uh ... I ... I believe Rape Bot is still watching them right now . I think Rape Bot is still watching them right now . Hold on one second . Let me find out . I 'll call him . Rape Bot ? Rape Bot , can you bring us the President 's films ? Could you bring in the President 's films for us , please ? [ mechanical whirring ] Rape Bot , what have you done with the President 's films ? I have repeatedly raped them . Oh ! Oh ! Get off of me ! Get off of me ! Dammit ! [ moaning ] Kill all the homos . Kill them , kill them all . They got AIDS as punishment . That 's what it 's all about . God is punishing the bad people , including those interstellar Chubbies . [ moaning ] I 'm getting a bad feeling about this , General . That 's probably because I got Alzheimer 's and I can 't stop farting . [ fart ] But Nancy likes the farting . [ fart ] And one more thing , General , destroy those Chubbies . Oh , yeah . Chubbies delenda est . Yeah . Yeah . Yes , yes , yes . Right away , Mr. President . Right away , sir . Dammit , Enis . Why is Rape Bot still on this ship ? Rape Bot can take a hint . [ mechanical whirring ] You know , you just hurt Rape Bot 's feelings . Hey , man . This is awesome . We have to have more parties here . Well , yeah , sure . And I went to the doctor , and it ends up I wasn 't pregnant after all . You know , I think I 'm ready to make a move on Samantha . [ groan ] You sure you want to do that , boss ? I mean , when she turns you down , it 's going to be awkward at work . Thank you . Cheers . All right . I thought about that , but it 's a chance I 'm willing to take . Well , if she says yes and becomes your girl or whatever , I 'm going to feel real guilty every time I masturbate to the thought of her luscious tits . I mean , she 's the girl for me , I know it . I 'm 17 years old . Next year , I 'm going to college . I don 't want to spend the rest of my life regretting not asking her out . Well , with any luck , you won 't have to leave this place a virgin , huh ? Cheers . Hey , Sam . You got a minute ? Yeah . Thank you so much . That was by far the dumbest conversation I 've ever had . So what 's up ? I ... I just wanted to say hi . Um , hi . Hi . Uh , I mean , are you having fun at the party ? Yeah , it 's pretty rad , but I could be a lot drunker . So is something on your mind ? Yeah , you know , we 've been working together for the past year and hanging out a lot at school . It 's just been really cool getting to know you . You 're pretty cool too , Tom . Most guys really just want to fuck me . [ awkward laugh ] Well , Samantha , you know , being around you just kind of makes me feel like a kid at Christmas . You see a preview for a toy you want on TV . You just see the commercial over and over . And then Christmas comes , and you see the box under the tree . It 's the same size and shape of the toy you want . But you don 't want to wait until Christmas . Yeah , so you open it before Christmas just to see what it is . Exactly . So with that in mind , I just want to tell you ... Charlie , Ruth Anne , it 's about time . We were worried about you . You guys are so lucky . This place is going on shut down in 15 minutes . Holy shit . You guys are so high . Party . Fuck yeah , I want to party . Let 's spark it . Hey , were we done talking about Christmas ? Uh , yeah , that 's all . All right , cool . Hm , pussed out , didn 't you ? Buzz off . [ banjo playing on tv ] MAN ( ON TV ) : Help me , Sheriff Gary . Help me . [ laugh ] [ meow ] Oh , he really got him good that time , eh , Mr. Rumsfeld ? Rumsy , where are you ? You 're missing this good movie . GARY ( ON TV ) : I 'll shoot you right now , motherfucker . [ gunshots ] Hushed up another one , Moody . You 're still the big dick shit kicker you always were . GARY ( ON TV ) : Now don 't be afraid now , little lady . Why don 't you just come over here and give me a kiss ? Oh , watch out now . [ gunshots ] Good movie , eh , Mr. Rumsfeld ? GARY ( ON TV ) : I 've taken out every goon from El Paso to Del Rey . [ crash ] What the fuck ? What in the hell is going on ? I 'm trying to have a nice , peaceful evening on Halloween , and there 's all this ... what is this ? Cum ? There 's faggots in my house . Fucking faggots . I 've got a Louisville slugger here , and I will shove it right up your faggoty asses . Wouldn 't you like that ? Show yourselves , faggots . Where are you ? Holy fuck ! Get back here , shit heel . Where 'd you go ? Where are you ? Show your slimy little ass so I can blast you into outer space . Well , hello . And goodbye , tiny faggot . [ thud ] Oh , you little bastard . [ laugh ] Mr. Rumsfeld ! Why didn 't you meow to me ? [ sobbing ] Where 'd you go , you little faggot ? Where are you ? You can 't hide from Moody very long . [ crunch ] Oh ! Oh , no , you don 't . Get out of my ass , you little fucking dick . Get out of my ass . I 'll shit you out . Nobody fucks Moody . [ grunting ] [ farting ] Get out of my ass , demon ! [ sloshing ] I 'm a faggot ! [ music playing ] [ clank ] [ thud ] Did you just hear something ? It was probably the sound of my beating heart . What ? Nothing , nothing . Do you want another beer ? [ beeping ] [ scream ] Whoa ! Whoa , man . This is like , a private party . Whoa , man . Put the gun down . You 're safe . Everything 's fine , right , guys ? Yeah , it 's cool . It 's cool . [ gurgling ] Whoa , what ... Charlie ? [ pew ] [ explosion ] Hold still , you psycho . Someone grab his gun . Sam , get some rope . CASS : Get off me ! There 's more Chubbies ! I told you to shut up , man . Get him in the chair . [ squirming ] What the fuck , man . This guy just blew Charlie 's head off . I got Charlie 's blood all over my fucking boom box . God dammit , Wendel . Who gives a fuck about your stupid ass boom box ? Put it down and help us . Who the hell is this guy ? I don 't know . I 've never seen him before . How the hell did he get in here ? I thought the doors locked at midnight . They were ... oh , shit . No , no , no , no , no ! What is it ? We 're locked in . He locked us in . Let 's just call the cops . OK . [ chomping ] You guys , the phone lines are down . Fuck it . Break a window . We can 't . Moody just installed triple bulletproof glass windows . Oh , dammit . Yep , we 're fucked . This fucking place . Moody 's going to kill me . You need to calm down too , all right , Tom ? I don 't think I can . There 's blood everywhere . Charlie 's dead . There 's no way out . I 've never had an anxiety attack , but I 'm pretty sure I 'm having one now . I think this is what it feels like . Samantha , I love you . I don 't mean to say it like this , but I 'm pretty sure we 're all dying . I just love you , and I want you to know that , all right ? [ smack ] Calm the fuck down . Thank you . We all need to calm the fuck down . Ruth Anne , she looks kind of collected for her boyfriend just getting shot in the face . Well , he was kind of a dick . Focus up . Does anyone have like , a satellite phone ? Oh , yeah , but I left it out in my $ 20,000 Corvette . Who do you think I am ? Daddy Warbucks ? I 'm just asking , Wendel . I have to destroy the Chubbies . Excuse me , who are you , and why the fuck did you kill Charlie ? That wasn 't your friend . He was invaded by a Chubby . I 'm going to kick this guy 's butt . Wait . He 's tied up . He can 't hurt us . Who are you ? My name 's Cass Coridore . I 'm from the Planet Snerd , and I 'm on a mission to track and kill the Chubbies . Let me go so I can do my job . Where 's my space lasers ? WENDEL : This guy is nuts . So you expect us to believe that you 're an alien chasing after other aliens ? Give me a break , dude . If you 're an alien , why do you look like us ? Planet Snerd has the same molecular structure as your Planet Earth . We have a sun . We breathe oxygen . We just don 't have sex . It 's been outlawed . So women are artificially inseminated . WENDEL : So you don 't fuck ? No wonder this guy 's a maniac . I don 't like this . Let 's just get out of here . Well , we could if spaceman didn 't lock us in . What are these Chubbies you keep talking about ? The Chubbies are three awful creatures that were supposed to go to a prison planet on my solar system . But they escaped . They are now on your Planet Earth . And they want one thing and one thing only ... to have sex . And the way they do that is by invading another life form , like your friend Charlie . Once the Chubbies are inside you , they will use your body as a vehicle , and they will stop at nothing to reproduce . I shot your friend Charlie because he was infected with a Chubby . The Chubbies are most dangerous when they 're inside a female host . Once inside , they can use the female reproductive organs to spawn multiple Chubbies almost instantly . You have to believe me . Take my space lasers and kill the other two . You don 't know how dangerous they are . I saw it firsthand . [ smack ] I had enough of his lip . Put him in the corner . We 'll wait it out . Moody 'll be here at 8 : 00 AM to open the doors , right ? Yeah . What about the Chubbies ? I saw one . He might be telling the truth . Moody 's going to kill me . He trusted me , and I failed him . Look , Tom , I 'll take the blame completely . We 'll just say that this guy came in and took us hostage , and we fought back . We 'll be heroes , and we 'll probably be on the news and shit . Moody won 't even care in that case . It 'll probably even give him some free publicity . You 'll take the blame ? Skin it , man . What are you going to do with the body ? Oh , Rape Bot , would you come here , please ? [ mechanical whirring ] Rape Bot , I just wanted to apologize for being so rude to you earlier . I ... I 've been under a lot of stress lately from these damn Chubbies . I shouldn 't have taken it out on you . Rape Bot heard what you said . Perhaps a little raping is in order . No , no , thank you . I just wanted to let you know that you do a fine job here doing what you do . So , please , accept my apology . Rape Bot knows not how to forgive . Only rape . Well , OK , that 's fair enough . How about you get reprogrammed to not just rape anymore ? World would be destroyed . End of Rape Bot . Yes , yes , very true . But what if we reprogrammed you into being something more useful around here like a Chef Bot or a Garden Bot ? Would you like that ? You cannot change what Rape Bot is . Rape Bot may not have feelings , but it knows what it is . Rape Bot is done with you . Oh , Rape Bot , don 't be like that . Rape Bot said it is done with you . Enis , what are you doing ? I was just apologizing to Rape Bot here . Have you heard from Coridore ? No , nothing from the space communicator . Well , keep a Snerdian ear out . Let me know if you hear anything . We have to get this done or our planet is as good as extinct . Rape Bot will survive . It needs not oxygen . That was a low blow , Rape Bot , even for you . Suck my parts , Enis . Look , I want you to know how unrealistic your story sounds . But I do admit something fucked up is going on here tonight . Will you just untie me ? I 'm not a bad guy . Oh yeah ? What do you do on your planet , Cass ? I 'm a lawyer . [ laugh ] So that makes you a good guy ? I was the Chubbies' defense attorney . I believe in giving everyone a fair trial , whether they deserve it or not . If you defend them , why are you trying to kill them ? I didn 't realize how terrible they were . I was on the ship with them when they were being transported . This was all my fault . I was the one who freed them because I thought it was the right thing to do . But they murdered the pilot on the ship , and then they tried to murder me . Now , I 'm just trying to fix my wrong . Please , you have to let me . Do you know how crazy that sounds ? Look , if you don 't believe me , then just keep me tied up to this chair . But your friend is infected , and there 's another Chubby loose . Take my space laser and shoot them before it 's too late and others die . Hey , is it true that you shit yourself a half hour after you die ? I don 't know , Wendel . Why don 't you check Charlie 's shorts for some Hershey 's syrup ? You guys , I 'm seriously worried about Ruth Anne . She 's just walking around like a zombie . I don 't even think I 've seen her blink . She 's ... she 's probably going through a grieving process or something . I don 't know . Ruth Anne , are you OK ? [ music playing ] Oh my god , what a slut . [ crunching ] [ splashing ] Whoa ! Whoa ! [ scream ] Oh my god , one of those things is inside of me . I can 't get pregnant . My dad 's going to kill me . Fuck . No . [ sobbing ] [ pew ] - What the fuck was that ? - You see ? Untie me . Fuck . No ! [ pew ] [ explosion ] All right , Earth kids , listen up . That was a Chubby . That is what invaded your friends . I 'm not here to hurt any of you . I just want to kill those fuck twerps so I can get back to my home planet . As far as I see it , you can do one of two things ... Help me destroy those creatures or get the Snerd out of my way . What 's it going to be ? Yeah , we 'll help . All right . Now , take me around this building so we can find those Chubbies and destroy them . Let 's move . [ music playing ] My space tracker isn 't reading anymore . They could be anywhere . We should probably split up , cover more ground . Fine . You three go over there , get some weapons . Sam and I will go through here . Hey , why is she going with you ? Because she 's the only one I actually trust with the space laser . It 's OK , Tom . I 'm a big girl . Go . Whoa , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a second . That space dick wants us to go look for the Chubbies , but we don 't even have any weapons . What are we going to do when we find them ? I got mine . All right , let 's go . Hold on , hold on . I gotta go take a bodacious dump . All right , just hurry up . When you 're done , meet us in Moody 's office . All right , give me two minutes . Gotta grab my tunes too . All right , hurry up . So do they really say " get the Snerd out of here " in your planet ? Snerds yeah . Oh , look at this . It 's stuck . CASS : Be careful . There 's , um ... something happening to me . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Maybe they invaded me without me knowing . What ? There 's , um ... Something happening to my urinal extractor . You mean this ? Yes . Have you ever had a boner before ? I ... I don 't know . Have you ever had sex before ? No . It 's outlawed on Snerd . Plus , our Boner-Tron anti-gravity pull won 't allow us to even try . Have you ever seen these before ? I don 't know what 's happening , but I really want to grab those . Do it . Come on , spaceman , fuck me . OK . [ moaning ] Fucking aliens killing my buzz . Killed my girl . Slimy bastards got in her before I could . She 's dead . Charlie 's dead . Ruth Anne 's dead . Got Charlie 's fucking brains all over my costume . This is the worst Halloween party ever . Oh , man . Oh . Oh . Oh , no . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . You know , I don 't trust that guy . We should 've never left him alone with Samantha . Look , you need to cut that jibber jabber . We have more important things to worry about , like not getting our b-holes penetrated by those things . Well , what are we going to do when we do find them ? Sweep them to death ? I don 't know , Tom . This is my first encounter with an alien life form . Oh , is that candy ? No . [ snap ] Ah ! Son of a bitch ! Ow ! Yeah , Moody 's an asshole . I just wish we had some kind of weapons . What 's in the box ? Let 's find out . It 's locked . What are you doing ? No ! [ crack ] Oh . Holy shit . Fuck me . I knew Moody was paranoid , but ... Holy Macanoli ! Do you know how to load one of those ? No . BOTH : Wendel . His pops was a deputy sheriff . I 'm sure he showed him how to use one of those before . TOM : You 're right . EDDIE : Where is he ? [ door creaking ] Oh , speak of the devil . Hey , man , can you ... [ groaning ] Chubby . OK , man . Just calm down . You can fight this . Hit him , you fool . You hit him . [ thud ] Come on , Wendel . It 's me ... Eddie . Look , man , there 's a Chubby in you . Just try to shit it out , maybe ? I don 't want to have to hurt you , buddy , but if I have to use force ... [ thud ] Aw . Wendel , please . Get off of him ! [ squish ] [ growling ] [ screaming ] [ splashing ] Make it stop . [ sobbing ] Are you OK ? [ gagging ] No . I 'm covered in ass shit . [ squirming ] Come on . We have to get that little fuck . Grab the guns . The grenade is mine . [ screaming ] Wait . Do you hear that ? - Yeah . - Could be Sam . She 's in trouble . Let 's go . Wow ! Oh , this is great . Oh yeah , spaceman . So this is sex ? Yes , this is sex . I love sex . Me too . Wow ! Wow , this is great . Hey . Did you see it ? What ? A Chubby ? No . Crocodile Dundee . Yes , a Chubby . What 's that smell ? It 's shit . We just had to shove a broom up our best friend 's ass , and now , I 'm covered in blood , shit , and Chubby cum . Wendel 's dead ? Yeah , he 's fucking dead . And we could have avoided it too if you weren 't over here fucking the spaceman . Tom . Don 't Tom me . I 'm over this bullshit . I 've been nothing but a good guy to you for the past year . And this guy , this space dick 's been here less than two hours , and he 's already inside you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm done . I 'm going to go out there and wait until morning . Have fun on your alien adventure . Tom , wait . No . Let him go . You need to stick with us . The Chubbies want you to procreate . Having them trapped inside here is our best chance of destroying them . What time does your boss come ? Uh , couple hours , I guess . Then we have some time to find them and destroy them . If the Chubbies get loose outside , your city , your state , your world will be taken over by these sex-fueled creatures who will stop at nothing to hump their way to global domination . For the time being , Samantha , it 's your butt hole they want . Our primary objective is to protect your anus at all costs . Aw , that 's the sweetest thing a boy has ever said to me . I 'm no boy . I 'm Cass Coridore , space lawyer . [ chubby snickering ] Ow . What the fuck ? Ow ! Sam , get back . SAM : Oh , shit . - Get the fuck off me . - Shoot it . Shoot it . I can 't get a clear shot . [ growling ] Mr. Moody . I 'm so glad to see you . Listen , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean for any of this to happen . I only threw the Halloween party because I didn 't think you were going to find out . The place is trashed . Most of my friends are dead . And it 's all my fault . I didn 't mean for any of this to happen , and I regret it all . I 'm so sorry . And I betrayed your trust . That 's the worst part . Punish me however you see fit , but we need to leave now . Mr. Moody , are you OK ? Faggot ! [ gurgling ] Tom ! Oh . Ew . Whoa . Onto me , my children . My daddy . My daddy . [ crunch ] Oh ! Oh . [ gurgling ] That 's not good . [ growl ] [ laugh ] [ pew pew pew ] Fools ! Your Snerdian space lasers won 't work on me . Oh , fuck . [ laugh ] Fuck indeed . You 're all going to get fucked , starting with you . And after I fuck you , we 'll fuck your whole town . We 'll be the new Adam and Eve , and we 'll just keep fucking until we spread the Chubbies' seed through the entire planet . I already told them your plan , and that 's not going to happen . You won 't be telling anyone anything when you have this chubby in your mouth . Stop it , Moody . Look , I know you never really liked me . You always called me a gay wad and stuff . But there 's gotta be some good left in you . You can be a hero by killing yourself and the Chubbies . You can save us and the planet . Please , Moody . [ whispering ] What ? Fire ! [ scream ] Samantha , you have to run . Get out of here . Moody 's right by the door . There 's no way he 'll let me pass . I 'll create a diversion . Come on . Come on , Chubbies . Fuck me . Go ahead , stick it right here in my butt cave . Come on , you big , fat pussylicker . Fuck . [ glass shattering ] Where were we ? Oh , yes . The fucking . Sam , get out of here . Hail to the kingpin , baby . [ squish ] [ screaming ] [ explosions ] [ glass shattering ] GENERAL ( ON RADIO ) : Cass . Come in , Cass . I 'm here . The Chubbies , are they destroyed ? Yes , they 've been blown up . Phew . Oh , that is exquisite news , Cass . Very good . When you get back to Snerd , I will make sure Rape Bot erects a statue in your honor . My erection is only made for raping . When will Rape Bot find time for a statue ? Hey , that 's OK . Because everybody on this planet looks like him . We 'll just say it 's for him . Yeah . Oh , so that 's it ? My friends are dead . I don 't have a job . And you 're going to leave , just like everybody else ? Cass , give me your coordinates . We 'll send a spaceship to pick you up right now . General . Enis . You can go ahead and shove that shuttle up your fat fucking asses . I 'm staying on Earth . What in the Snerd ? Cass , you can 't be serious . You 'll be a hero here . I don 't care . I found something more important to me . Tits . I found out that I love big , fat fucking tits . And my dick , it works on Earth . And I have someone to use it on . Screw you , Snerdians . Coridore ! [ glass shattering ] [ police sirens ] Let 's get the Earth out of here . Let 's go . So I guess I should 've asked you earlier , but how old are you ? 1.28 Snerd sacks . Why ? Um , well , if anyone asks , just say you 're in high school , like me . OK . [ laughing ] [ music playing ]

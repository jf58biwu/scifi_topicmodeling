What 's up , little sister ? Where 's this moppet at ? ( Whirring ) - Man : I hope he enjoys himself . - All right , here we go . - ( Switch clicks ) - ( Explosion ) Shit . ( Clicking ) Your middle name should have been " abortion . " He at the shoot house yet ? He 's pretty close . We made it impossible though . - Eight rounds , nine targets . - That 's not very nice , Henry . Yeah yeah , he shot Michael . It 's way too soon . Way fucking too soon . All right , here we go , last room . - Oh ! - Oh ! ( Laughing ) - Why don 't you ever do that ? - Fuck you . Bring him in . ( Switches clicking ) ( Camera whirs ) Man # 2 on intercom : " G " ! Enjoy your run back to base . ( Gunshots ) ( Man humming ) ( British accent ) Top man ! Oh , thank you . - Preston . - Jonathan ... - Gates . - Seriously , who throws a fucking pistol , mate ? Just seemed like the thing to do at the time . - Banger ? - Absolutely . Good , how you doing ? Good to see you , gates . - You too , Henry . - We 've gotta get the rest of your paperwork - ironed out . Locke 's inside . - Roger that . - Hang tight on that . I 'll be back . - No worries . Oi ! Food 's ready . - ( Radio playing music ) - Well , this is home . - I like it . - This is " v. " Hi , how you doing ? - He 's shy . - Man : Gates ! You , my friend , are a complete fucking psycho . - Henry : He 's certainly got- - - don 't you have some goddamn paperwork to do ? - Henry : You got some child support to pay ? - Man : Fuck you . - Welcome to the blackjacks . - Thank you , sir . Follow me . I have thrown a pistol before , but never in a shoot house . Yeah , me neither . I almost didn 't do it . It held up pretty well . Springfield . - I 'm a Kimber man myself . - Gates : I like Kimber . - ( Gun clicks ) - Springfield just feels right . So , gates , what was your monthly take-home in the army ? - 4170 with b.A.H. - Mmm . Our minimum contracts are six figures apiece . The thing is I 've seen a lot of guys lose their shit when they start making that kind of money . Trust me , you 're gonna need help figuring out what to do with it . I know a few bean counters . They 'll get you squared away and make sure you don 't blow it up your nose . Appreciate it . - You got some talent . - Thank you . Talent just tells me that you can . What concerns me is if you will . I got one rule , gates . Never question me . Welcome aboard . ( Beeping ) ( Water rushes ) ( Water rushing ) ( Distant barking ) Miss ! We already checked that whole South sector . Jesus ! Smith , over here ! Don 't worry , sir . We 'll get you out of here . ( Beeping ) ( Distant barking ) ( Water running ) - ( Bird cawing ) - ( Barking continues ) ( Wind gusting ) ( Machinery whirring ) Hi . ( Beeps ) ( Keyboard clicking ) You get any sleep last night ? - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Alison . Don 't be afraid . I 'm not . It 's just that ... There has to be something else we can do . - Like what ? - We could do nothing . I did this . I cannot let anyone else be responsible for its outcome . It 's too valuable . Is it worth it ? - I miss your mom . - Me too , - and I want to go home . - We are going home . ( Chimes ) ( Beeping ) Hey . ( Machinery whirring , crackling ) ( Shower running ) ( Alarm blaring ) ( Beeping , alarm stops ) ( Latches clicking ) - Man : Of course I 'm a cutthroat . - ( Camera clicking ) You don 't get to where I 'm at by being a pussy . I 'm unapologetically ruthless , or ruthlessly unapologetic , but there 's no mystery there . You don 't need that for the article . Why don 't you get to the point and ask me what you came here to ask me ? What did I come here to ask you ? You want to know where Dr. Whitmore is . Okay . One of the finest energy researchers in the country has been missing for ... nine months . Where is your former partner ? - I don 't know . - ( Camera continues clicking ) We think he was kidnapped . What I do know is we have a $ 3.5 million effort , and the finest people in the world are looking for him . Why don 't we take a few pictures ... In the bedroom ? Woman : Sir ? - There 's a situation . - Mm-hmm . Give me 19 minutes . We don 't have 19 minutes . ( Camera clicking ) Mmm , this interview ... Is over . ( Whirring , crackling ) - ( Alarm blaring ) - ( Rumbling ) ( People clamoring ) ( Whooshes ) ( Creature noises ) ( Alarm continues ) ( Snarling , screeching ) ( Snarling ) ( Screams ) ( Sobbing ) No . ( Screaming ) ( Growls ) Tell me ... everything . We lost all communication with the facility approximately 26 minutes ago . We were alerted when the reactor started producing dangerous levels of energy . Just as we got online , the entire facility went dark . When can we be back online ? We can 't , not from here . Someone has to re-establish communication from the inside . Fuck ! Whitmore has something to do with this . We should terminate the project . - I can fix this . - Sir , if this gets out- - I 'm not gonna blow up a billion-dollar facility just because the phones are down . I want the best combat extraction team available to go in and get me Whitmore . I don 't care what it costs . ( Engines revving ) ( Cellphone buzzing ) - Hey . - Locke : Hey . Get to the airstrip . Now ? Yeah . ( Jet roaring ) - What 's taking so long ? - Just waiting for a signal . Should be about five minutes , sir . Henry : You guys got me ? Locke : We got you , Henry . Cromwell : We don 't have time for formalities . Apparently your team is the best , so I 've hired you . To the point : Two days ago i lost contact with an off-the-books facility Now if you watch the news , you would know my partner Dr. mark Whitmore has been missing for some time . He 's not . He 's here working for me at this very location . The following is the last footage we have of him before the drop in communication . - ( Alarm blaring ) - ( Rumbling ) There was seismic activity at the time of the recording . It might be the reason for the drop . I don 't care . I just need to know he 's alive . I 've lost contact with above-ground security that guards the entrance . Link up with them - ( Door closes ) - I understand your team has worked with psychic operators before . Lisa westbrook is the best in the business . If Whitmore is down there , she will find him . Don 't fuck this up . Please . I 'll be in your ears till you reach the base , then we 're going to be black until you fire up the link underground . Roger that , Henry . - ( Chuckles ) - Miss westbrook ? Lisa , please . It 's fairly straightforward . I just need to get close enough to get a lock on the doctor . And once I have positive I.D. , you will get him and get out . Exactly how are you going to " lock in " on their location ? So I round the corner , right ? And this fucking guy is shirtless and he 's holding back four of these huge Brazilian dudes , guns drawn , and he 's got a knife to the throat of the bouncer and I 'm like , " Jesus . What the fuck have I stumbled into ? " - Preston : They were puerto rican . - Ed : What ? Hey , I got this round . - Preston : Thanks , gatesy . - Ed : Fuckin-a , new guy . Right on . Make it a double ! - Can I get you something ? - No thanks . I got one . Can I ask you a question ? ( Sighs ) Sure . How long have you been psychic ? Or whatever the gift is that you have . Why ? Sorry . Didn 't mean to pry . No no , it 's- - it 's fine . My mom has some sort of gift . She gets these feelings about things . - Empathic . - Yeah , maybe . But it was kinda rough growing up like that . I can 't even imagine what it was like for you . You know , you don 't strike me as the operator type . ( Team laughing , chatting ) Ed : Yo , v , what is up ? Nice ! Where are we going , huh ? You want to get out of here ? Yeah , the air force is full of alternative units . - Do they recruit or what ? - Uh-huh . My first unit was a remote viewing squadron . - And what was your job ? - I worked with a lot of para-rescue guys . You know , finding downed pilots and such . - Oh . - And then the last few years I worked strictly with a snatch-and-grab team . Like kicking in doors ? Yeah . Well , I was there more to find the target , obviously . So why 'd you get out ? I , um ... I did some things that I wasn 't proud of . So tell me how it works . - What ? - Finding people . Okay , so your body gives off a vibration that I can feel . And everyone 's is slightly different . And you can feel this anywhere in the world ? Oh no no no . I mean , I can only do it - within a mile or so . - Oh . Here , watch . - ( Distorted static ) - Oh shit ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to freak you out . No , that 's- - that 's incredible . Can you do that again ? Yeah . Yeah , I can 't do it for very long though . - ( Distorted static ) - Jesus . - Oh God , I 'm so sorry . - ( Hisses ) - Are you okay ? - Yeah . What was that ? That 's never happened before . Are you sure you 're okay ? ( Chuckles ) Yeah , you know , I 'd better ... - Go to bed . - Yeah . Sorry about your finger . ( Distorted snarling , screeching ) ( Machinery whirring ) Man : Oh . - ( Snarling ) - Oh ! ( Screeching ) ( Screams ) There you go , swag monkey . Good boy . ( Clinks ) ( Engines humming ) I can 't believe you 're actually jumping with us . I hope you don 't burn in . I only weigh 100 lbs . I 'd just bounce off the ground . ( Laughing ) - ( Beeping ) - All right , blackjacks ! Don 't be pussies . ( Cackles ) That 's cute . Are you gonna walk 10 paces behind us ? Are you gonna button your fly ? Preston : Underwear , mate . Knock it off . Let 's go . It chafes too much . - Locke : " Men in black . " - Will Smith . " Independence day . " Brent spiner . Who the fuck is Brent spiner ? ( Chuckles ) He was the scientist dude . Challenge . Brent spiner was data on " Star Trek : The next generation . " You are such a fucking nerd . ( Birds cawing ) - So what do you do for fun ? - ( Laughs ) - Just making small talk . - Shh shh shh . - What 's up ? - Hold on a second . ( Thunder rumbling ) - Locke : What 's up ? - I 'm picking up a group of people about a mile away . - Can you tell who they are ? - No . They 're all males . There 's about 15 of them . Henry , any chance we can get eyes on location ? Lisa 's picking up targets nearby . Negative , Locke . Your sat 's still down . You know what ? Let me see what I can piggyback on . Locke , wait one- - there 's a Russian satellite . I 'll give it a shot . Locke , I got eyes on , but the image is completely scrambled . Roger . - What does that mean ? - I don 't know . Hey , v. I need you right there . Ed , Preston . You guys post up right here . - Lisa ? - Yeah ? You 're with v. She can tell us where everybody is . Stay at least 40 meters behind me . And don 't give away my position . Okay . Gates . You 're with me . ( Thunder rumbling ) Locke : What do you think , v ? - Looks like a merc group . - Gates : They 're chechen . I 've seen their kind before . Yusufiyah ' 05 . They 're nasty . I 've had some experience with these clowns as well . ( Whimpering ) V : Hey , they have an American down there . - Locke : Henry . - Go ahead . We have eyes on location . There 's a group of hostiles on the ground . Hey , I 've got casualties in the west corner . Looks like they 've killed the security detail . There 's one left alive . V : Locke . I 'm gonna drop this motherfucker . He 's about to take this guy down . V : I say again , i have the shot . Locke : Negative . Don 't compromise your position . We can 't maneuver from here . Gates : Locke , they 're gonna kill this guy . - V : We 're running out of time . - Stand down . You take that shot , we 'll have 20 a.K.S lighting this hill up . Henry , you tell cromwell we 're taking these fuckers out . Henry : That 's a go , Locke . - All right . - V : Fuck ! God damn it , God damn it . God damn it . Fuck ! All right , we 're gonna secure this compound . V , you wait for us to get into position , then on my signal start putting fuckers to sleep . About fucking time . Gates and I will lead . Ed , Preston , you two follow and flank . Let 's get as close as we can before we go loud . Lisa , tell me how many targets are down there . 16 total targets . Most are in the main building . All right , gentlemen , nothing fancy . Straightforward violence of action . Let 's go . Locke : Go hot in three ... Two ... One . ( Yelps ) ( Shouting ) Motherfucker ! Fuck , ed . Locke : V , a little help ! I don 't got a shot on the guys inside . V , there 's three coming around the back of the building . - There 's nothing there . - Just wait , they 're coming around . Lisa , don 't let that fucker flank us ! - Gates ? - Clear ! All clear , Eddie . V , we 're coming out . ( Clicks ) ( Clicks ) ( Distorted static ) ( Locke groans ) ( Groaning ) Get away from me . Ed : Blackjack ! Don 't say a fucking word . Never shoot through a fucking door , fuck ! - All right , all right . - Motherfucker ! Getting a bit old for this , Locke , eh ? - Fuck you ! - He 's hit . Just cover it . Lisa , are we clear down here ? No one around but you guys . All right , v , bring it in . Ed : These assholes stink . Look what I found . Oh shit . - Henry . - Go ahead . The chechens were here for Whitmore . We found his pictures on one of them . - What ? Did they find the entrance ? - No . It was covered when we got here . - ( Locke groans ) - Cromwell : Fuck ! Okay , tell me when you have him . Yeah . Let 's go . Get it off . ( Beeping ) Shit . On me . Hey , hold up . Can I take a look at that map for a second ? Gates , map . All right , so I 'm picking up what looks like the reactor right there . It 's giving off a lot of interference . And I 'm picking up what I think is Dr. Whitmore right here . He 's in the lab area . Good . I 'm not picking up anyone else down here . It doesn 't matter . Our mission 's the doctor . - We get him , we get out . - Gates : Roger that . On me . It 's blood . Somebody was pissed off . You don 't have to worry about it . There 's no one else down here . I think we 've got it , westbrook . - Clear left ! - ( Grunts ) Clear right ! - Ed : Center clear . - Room clear . What the fuck ? Are you sure you 're not picking up anybody ? No one . Tell me when he gets close . 100 meters . On Eddie , let 's go ! Move out . Which way , gates ? Okay , left takes us to the comm room . And if we head right that should take us down to the lower research lab . Eddie . Take Preston , go left , set up comms . We 'll grab the target and meet you there . Be fast . I don 't want to be here all day . Are you sure you want to separate ? Yeah , I 'm sure . - Westbrook ! - Yeah ? You 're positive he 's down this way ? Gates . V. - ( Rattling ) - ( Creature snarling ) - Clear . - Fuck off . Is it gonna work ? I sure as shit hope so . - Bingo . - ( Laughs ) ( Keyboard clicking ) - Clear left . - Clear right . Room clear on me . - He should be right about here . - Locke : Go go . Whitmore ! Dr. Whitmore . Open the door ! - No . - Locke : Open the door . Cromwell sent us . Open the door . ( Whitmore mutters ) - ( Bangs ) - Open the fucking door . No . ( Keyboard clicking ) I got you , ed . You got picture ? Ed , do you have video ? Do you have audio ? - Ed ! - I heard you the first time , fuckstick . Hey , I 'm not paying you to fuck around ! Show some respect . Where 's Whitmore ? The rest of our team are acquiring him . - They 'll be here shortly . - All right , what 's the status of my facility ? Unknown . From what the psychic tells us there 's no one here except the doctor . - There 's nobody down there ? ! - No . - Son of a bitch . - ( Bangs ) The doctor should be here shortly , sir . Find him . Find him ! ( Pounds on window ) Hey , Whitmore , open the door ! Dr. Whitmore ? Dr. Whitmore , look at me . Look at me . I need you to open the door for us . Can you do that for me ? We 're here to protect you . Can you open the door ? ( Whispers ) V : Open the fucking door . ( Yelps ) You gotta- - you gotta close the door . You gotta- - I 'm sorry- - ow ! Ow ! Close the door ! Close the door ! Close the door ! You have to lock that door ! You have to lock the door ! - Close it , please please please . - Do it . You comfy ? ( Bangs ) I 'll get it , I 'll get it . Ahh . ( Whitmore grunting ) What happened down here , doc ? Where 's your staff ? V : Hey ! You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . ( Distant bang ) ( Snarling , screeching ) - ( Garbled noise ) - Cromwell : What are they doing ? Preston , can I get an e.T.A. On the doctor ? Yeah , hold on a sec . - ( Squelches ) - Ed , what the fuck ? ! Preston : Contact , contact ! - Whitmore : No , I 'm not going out there ! - Let 's move , move move move ! - I 'm not going out back there . - ( Gunshots ) Preston : Ed ! ( Screams ) Preston ! Motherfucker ! Preston , Preston , wake up . Preston , hey ! Come on , Preston ! Fuck ! Come on , man , come- - move move move move ! ( Grunts , gasping ) - Breathe breathe . - Ed , ed , ed ! - Oh shit . - Gotta breathe , gotta breathe , come on . Breathe breathe breathe . Come on , let 's get up . You can stand . Ready ? Let 's go . Get him the fuck in there ! Henry : Ed ? Fuck ! Locke , they got ed ! Who got ed ? What the fuck happened , Whitmore ? Ed , ed ! Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! ( Squelches ) - ( Snarling ) - ( Gunshots ) ( Screeching ) ( Gunshots continuing ) Fuck . Come on , gates . Fuck . Come on . Cromwell : Whitmore . - Whitmore ! - Talk , fucker . There was an accident . Henry : Locke , where 's ed ? - Shut the fuck up . - You shut the fuck up ! Henry , calm down . I need you to get us out of here . Don 't lose your head . - Cromwell : Whitmore ! - Whitmore : There 's some kind of creature running loose down here . It killed everybody . What the fuck are you talking about ? - Henry . - What , the entire staff is dead ? Whitmore : Everybody . Cromwell , you get that door open ! Cromwell , open that fucking door ! All right . V ? V. Henry ! - ( Gunshot ) - ( Groans ) ( Groans ) You motherfucker ! Fucker ! ( No audible dialogue ) ... fucking kill you . Goddamn motherfucker ! ( Keyboard clicking ) I 'm gonna fucking kill you ! ( Shouting ) Motherfucker ! Goddamn motherfucker ! Fucker ! V. We 'll fix it . Let 's finish this mission . Gear up . We need an exit . Ideas ? - Blow the door ? - We don 't have enough c-4 . Plus it 's a fucking shaft . Tell us how to get out of here . - Take me with you . - V : He 'll slow us down . - You want to go or not ? - Hey ! Fucking cooperate with us , all right ? Just cooperate with us and we will get you out of here , you understand that ? There 's a tunnel at the far side of the complex leading into the valley . Show me . - That 's a tunnel ? - Yeah . All right , I can get us there . - Alive , I hope . - Locke : That depends on you . What are we up against out there ? It came through the reactor . I developed a machine that could capture ribbons of energy in a parallel dimension . Cromwell was funding it . But three months ago he started to threaten me and my daughter , and I knew that if I delivered him the complete works , I would be dead . So I overcharged the reactor causing a distraction , during which I was supposed to meet a rescue team that would take me over the Russian border . Your rescue party was a group of chechen terrorists . No ! No no , they were just supposed to escort me . I had to get somewhere where cromwell couldn 't get to me . Focus . Describe it . Is it biological ? Is it mechanical ? What is it ? I only saw it for a moment . To come through the portal , I think it has to be biological . - Why didn 't you pick that up , huh ? - I don 't know . - That 's your job ! That is your job ! - I don 't know , okay ? It 's not giving off anything I can pick up ! I 'm sorry . Whatever that thing is , let 's headed for the tunnel . Staggered formation , keep your heads on a swivel , 360 at all times , watch your overheads and put rounds in anything that moves . Let 's go , come on . ( Snarling ) - Locke : Preston ! - I 'm all right . ( Low growling ) ( Growls ) ( Bangs , screeches ) ( Screeches ) ( Bangs , screeches ) Let 's move ! Move move move ! Come on ! Go go go ! ( Beeps ) ( Beeping ) - Gates ! - Clear ! - Gates ? - Clear . V : Clear right . - Preston ? - Clear ! V : All clear . Watch up top ! - What the fuck was that thing ? - ( Lisa coughs ) - Are you okay ? - ( Alarm blaring ) Aw , no . No no no no no . - What 's going on , doc ? - He 's overloading the reactor . It 's- - it 's gonna fracture . This whole place is gonna implode . - Shut it down . - I can 't shut it down ! Gates : All right , how much time do we have ? Nights on ! There 's no point . He cut the power . - Locke : So what ? - So ... You don 't understand . We cannot open the door - without power . - There 's always a backup generator . You just gotta find it . Yes yes yes , right there , right there . - That is a generator , I know it . - V : It 's far . - No , we can make it . - We gotta move . No , listen listen . I 'll get the power on . - I 'll meet you guys at this door right here . - No no no . - We stay together . - Do it . Are you sure you want to split us up again ? 'Cause we 're a lot more effective together . We lost ed , you saw what happened to Preston- - what the fuck is wrong with you ? Fuck , think outside of the fucking box ! God damn it ! Listen to me very carefully . Right or wrong , I make the decisions for this team . You follow orders or you 're free to go on your way . Is that clear ? Yeah . Okay . Do it . Let 's go . ( Beeps ) I 'm picking up something coming in fast . - Where ? - It 's right in front of us . It 's closing . Put rounds on this thing till it 's down ! Lisa : It 's closing . It 's closing ! Wait wait , it 's a female ! Hold your fire ! Cover . Covering . - Locke : Stay down ! - ( Yelps ) Who are you ? Whitmore : Alison ? Alison ! - Oh oh . - ( Sobbing ) - Who is she , Whitmore ? - It 's okay . - She 's my daughter . - Alison : It 's all our fault . No , we did what we had to do . - ( Bangs ) - Check her out , Preston . - Preston : Are you okay ? - Yeah . 10 seconds , Preston . Stick with me , yeah ? Let 's move . Move move ! ( Chain rattling ) Gates : Watch your overhead ! Shh shh shh shh . We 'll get out of this , okay ? ( Growling ) Locke : Holding ! - ( Growling ) - ( Gunfire ) ( Roars ) - ( Growls ) - ( Alison screaming ) Holding ! - My dad is out there ! - Locke : Clear left ! - Gates : Clear right . - Locke : Cover ! - Covering . - Preston : Put your head down , put your head down . Okay , get me some light over here . - Yeah yeah . - Some light . Preston : Okay , baby , okay okay okay . ( Shrieks ) I- - I can 't pick up v anymore . Preston : What ? V ! V ? - ( Snarling ) - V ! V ! V ! - V ! - ( Beeps ) ( Chomping ) - V ! - Is he alive ? I- - I don 't know . You don 't fucking know ? I don 't know ! I can barely pick up you guys . - ( Lisa sobbing ) - This is fucking bullshit . Get your shit together , Preston . What the fuck am I supposed to do ? - You do your job ! - Gates : No no no , hold it . I dumped a whole magazine into that fucker ! So did I. I 'm gonna keep on doing that ! - There 's no rolling fucking dice ! - What options do we have ? Hey hey , shut the fuck up ! Listen to me ! We can 't beat it . We can avoid it though . Now get the fuck down here and hold this and I 'll show you how . - You got it ? - Yeah , I think . This tunnel , right here , that can 't be more than a few feet wide . I don 't think that thing can fit through it . But if he does , we can focus all firepower into one direction . - ( Wheezing ) - Gates : All right ? Now it 's gonna drop us just shy of the door . - You see that ? - Good idea . Preston , can she move ? She has to . Yeah . - All right . - Gatesy , help me out with her . Three , two , one . Locke : Come on , come on , come on . - All right , clear . - Gates : Clear ! Men : Go go go go ! Lead on . Preston : Stay with me . - ( Sobbing ) - Okay . - I can 't . - Preston : Come on , stay with me . I can 't . ( Sobs ) ( Coughs ) ( Moans ) ( Coughing wetly ) Preston : Sweetie , are you all right ? - Locke : Preston ? - Just wait ! I wanna see my dad . Where is my dad ? It 's all right . You 're gonna see him soon . ( Gasping ) - Good boy . - Preston : V , you 're a beauty . Locke : Good to hear your voice , v. What 's your status ? I 'm good . Found a way around . I 'll be there soon . Hustle . We 're close . ( Rumbling ) Fuck , the reactor ! Get the fuck out of here ! Come on , move ! Gates : Watch your top . Watch it . - Locke : Preston , with me . - Open left , over left . - Locke : On me , watch out . - ( Clicking ) Come on , come on ! - Clear left ! - It 's not working ! - It 's not working ! - Check for a manual override . Here we go , here we go . I think I 've got it . This is it . Yes ! Yeah , that 's it ! That 's it ! ( Grunts ) Keep going , Preston . ( Yells ) ( Snarling ) ( Snarling ) ( Screeching ) ( Distant shouting ) Move ! ( Screeching ) Get this fucking thing open . ( Clicks ) ( Shouts ) ( Screams ) ( Clicks ) - Gates : I got you . - ( Creature screeches ) V ! Nice fucking shot . ( Groaning ) ( Rumbling ) Oh fuck . Come on , we gotta get the fuck out of here , come on . How many rounds you got ? Gates , how many rounds ? ! Nothing , I 'm out . I only got one clip of .45s. - Locke : Shit . - ( Gates groans ) Preston , let 's go . ( Snarling ) Preston ! Preston 's dead . We 've gotta go . - ( Screams ) - Preston ! - ( Growls ) - He 's gone ! Preston , Preston ! Go go ! Go go go go ! You go first . Go go go ! Hurry , get the fuck out of here . Fuck ! Come on , Locke . Come on . ( Screeches ) ( Screaming ) Locke ! Gates , get some slugs over here . What the fuck ? Shoot , man , shoot . - ( Gunshots ) - V : What the fuck ? Come on ! - I 'm out . - ( Locke continues screaming ) Shit ! ( Screaming ) Get the fuck out of here . Get the fuck out of here ! - ( Screams ) - What the fuck are you doing ? - No no . - Get the fuck outta here . - Gates , fucking go . - No no no . Fucking go , fucking go ! - V : Get the fuck- - - fuck ! ( Screeches ) - ( Distant siren ) - ( Footsteps ) ( Deep sigh ) This changes nothing , you know . ( Distorted static ) ( Screams ) And that wasn 't my only base of operations . Locke 's voice : Talent just tells me that you can . What concerns me is if you will .

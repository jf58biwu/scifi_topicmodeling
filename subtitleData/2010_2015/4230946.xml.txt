 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We answer to a higher authority . These are the Regents . Regents discuss , and I make the final decision . Agent Sally Stukowski , this is are- - Agent Nielsen . Ahh ! Ugh ! The doorknob is gone . Somebody must have followed . Stukowski played us . Why would she want an artifact ? She 's a sworn FBI Agent . - It 's done . - Now we wait . ♪ ♪ Since the days of Warehouse 2 , the Regents have been its protectors . Its first field agents , they were responsible for instituting the artifact collection procedures that we carry on today . Over time , as more and more artifacts were amassed , the Regents became not only its governors , but also the keepers of its secrets . Five ... Twenty ... Eight Donald Street . For 2,000 years , their grace , their wisdom , and their sacrifice has ensured the warehouses ' survival and security . Only now they 're the ones that need protecting . FBI Agent Sally Stukowski . Once we discovered that she 's the one who stole the triangle shirtwaist factory doorknob , I began tracking her activities- - Which , in addition to artifact heisting , also includes kidnapping and , if my calcs are right , murder . Four Regents have suffered artifact-related deaths in the past year . People whose connection to us is supposed to be secret . How 's Stukowski cracking our code ? One of the many mysteries du jour . You got proof that it 's her ? Plane tickets , hotel bills , rental cars , all registered to aliases traceable to her . And now a fifth regent , Theodora Stanton , has been reported missing . Wait , I met her . You--you don 't think that she- - Looks like we need to have a little talk with Ms. Sally Stukowski . Boys ! What are you doing here in " Hotlanta " on this glorious day ? Oh , are you chasing more strangeness ? Where 's Theodora Stanton ? Who 's Theodora Stanton ? Drop it , Stukowski . We know you 've been stealing artifacts . - And killing Regents . - Killing what now ? Come on , boys , we 're all on the same side here . I don 't think so , lady . You 're coming with us . Whoa . All right , Lattimer . No need to be rude . I am still a lady . - Whoa . - What the hell ? Whoa , whoa , girl . Say it . Fine . You were right . Zapping her should have been plan A. ♪ Warehouse 13 3x08 ♪ The 40th Floor Original Air Date on August 29 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = All right . Okay . Giving credit where it 's due , you did cover your tracks well . Claudia , can you reassemble her phone ? Don 't have to . SIM card . Well , well , well . What have we here ? Thanks for ruining my perfect retrieval record , Dolly Parton . Fire in the hole . And you 're not gonna be killing any more Regents with that , so you may as well start- - Y 'all are wasting your time . What 's done is done and done . What 's done ? What did you do ? Fine . Don 't talk . Oh , no . Y 'all are gonna beat it out of me with some paper ? Unlike you , we don 't torture people to get information . Put her hand on the parchment . Sir Henry Morton Stanley 's map will tell us exactly where you 've been in the last 12 hours . There , that 's the place . She went to the location more than once . How do you know ? Because X marks the spot . You sure this is it ? So Stanley 's map matched up with this address , 528 Donald Street . Whoa . Yeah . Even I 'm getting a bad vibe . No way . This building 's closed . NSA . You do know what those letters stand for , right ? National Security- - I don 't care if you 're the Pope . You 're not getting in here . You know what ? I-I think we 're in the wrong building . Thanks , guys . I 'm really sorry . Thank you very much . Uh- - uh , Artie ? We don 't usually get pushed around by rent-a-cops . Rent-a-cops don 't carry Colt .45s. You think they 're with Stukowski ? They would 've shot us by now . No , something 's up . We gotta get past them to figure out what . Claudia ? Oh , yeah . Tesla grenade . Don 't leave home without it . - Artie . - Yeah . Look at this . That 's the Eye of Horus . Uh , that 's- - these guys are- - - What , what , what ? - They 're- - - What ? What 's wrong ? 40th floor , Suite 4013 . Who is Diana K. Snow ? Shhh . Uh , Claudia , Pete , check out that security camera footage . I want to know exactly what Stukowski was doing here . And , Myka , you 're with me . Wait , what do we do when goons one and two wake up ? Uh , improvise . You got me tied up pretty snug here , Stevie . I 'm not that kind of gal . Oh , not that you 'd care . You know , Sally , even if I did like girls , I 'm pretty sure an hour with you would turn me gay . Today is gonna end very badly for your people . Really ? Well , if it ends badly for us , it ends badly for you . Oh , Agent Jinks , bless your heart . You can 't avoid the iceberg . The ship you 're on is going down . Lucky for you , there 's a lifeboat . You and I can both be on it . Now who 's wasting their time ? These Regents y 'all are running around trying to protect , they 're not the paragons of virtue you think they are . And I can prove it . Can you , Ms. Stukowski ? Because that is something I would very much like to hear . Okay , that closet ought to hold those guards for a while . Any sign of Stukowski on the security footage ? Yep . She 's got a playmate . All right . Artie , she wasn 't alone . Stukowski has a partner ? Yeah , they were both here earlier dressed as painters . Find him . See what he knows . And the SIM card . Well , let 's see who Stukowski has on her evil friends and family plan . Hold , please . Multiple calls to the same number thin the past 48 hours . Triangulating that number 's current location brings us to ... 2128 Peachtree Avenue . That 's gotta be where Stukowski 's partner is right now . I am so glad you 're on our team . Choo ! Artie , who is Diana K. Snow ? Adwin Kosan . It 's an anagram . That 's all right , Mr. Jackson . They are warehouse agents . Uh , Mr. Kosan , forgive the intrusion , but we have reason to believe your life may be in danger . That 's highly unlikely , Agent Nielsen . No one knows we 're here . - We ? - We who ? Three Regents in one place . Yeah , three birds with one stone . You all need to come with us right now . I imagine you two are the reason my men downstairs aren 't responding ? Possibly . You are ... ? Going to be a problem . Mr. Jackson is the head of regent security . This is Philip Petrov from Moscow , and this is- - Jane . You were about to explain the reason for this intrusion . Sally Stukowski- - this is the woman who has been picking off your fellow Regents- - was in this building earlier today with an accomplice . Now , we have her in custody , but- - Thank you . You might 've started with that . Sirs , ma 'am , this location has been compromised . We need to go . Now . Oh , what a good idea . Last time someone targeted the Regents was 1812 . Napoleon tried to wrest control of Warehouse 11 from Tsar Alexander the First . Precautions had to be taken . Miller , Stentz , do you copy ? Why didn 't you bring more men ? The Regents do not travel with an army . We are not the President , Agent Bering . We meet rarely , and when we do , we do so quietly . We never meet in the same place twice . This location was chosen only three hours ago . Then how did Stukowski find you ? She 's obviously more resourceful than you realized . Wait , no , the- - the stairs are safer . Elevator 's faster . 40 flights of stairs will take way too long . - Yes , but it- - - With all due respect , Agent Bering , we had this building secure until your team showed up . What is happening ? The automatic brake is engaged . That only happens in case of ... Emergency . What is that noise ? Give me a boost . That 's why you don 't take the elevator . What 'd you see up there ? The cables are gone . There 's a corrosive energy eating away at the emergency brakes . We don 't have much time . Artie , did you bring the grappler ? Of course . Well , that 's not standard warehouse issue . It was in 1890 . Okay . Tie it off . Okay . Open the doors , quick . All right , everybody out . Out , quick ! Go , go , go ! Whoa ! Go , Artie , out ! Agh ! - Are you all right ? - Uh- - Oh ! Oh . Stukowksi 's got another artifact . Well ! Irene Frederic herself . I am honored . Drop it , Sally . You 're from Connecticut . Wow . Very good . That 's right , boy wonder . Even the human lie detector can 't hear a phony accent . So ... What ? I 'm supposed to be scared ? Fear is a powerful motivator , Ms. Stukowski . But we both know what really motivates people is pain . All those people you tortured and killed were more than just Regents . They were my friends . Those friends are the ones that started this , lady . Started what ? What did you do ? You 'll see soon enough . We 're terribly sorry to be losing such a valued customer , Mr. Aquino . Isn 't there anything I can do to change your mind ? No , no , no . Just transfer the funds to this account at Grand Cayman Federal , hm ? Okay , Stukowski 's partner . What 's the 411 on this guy ? According to Interpol , James Aquino is a demolitions expert and wanted in nine countries . He enjoys hand-to-hand combat , mixing molotov cocktails , and instigating regime change in foreign lands . Well , Sally has some high-class friends . So if she 's going all ten-little-Indians on the Regents , shouldn 't one of us be minding the reservation ? Well , there 's no safer place on Earth than the warehouse . Artie says its contingencies have contingencies . All right , I 'm going in . We 're hot on the bad guy 's trail now , Artie--what 's up ? Stukowski took out the elevators in this building using some kind of corrosive artifact . Now , her associate may still have it . Be careful . Okay , Mr. Aquino . You 're all set to go . Thank you very much . Hold on there , Jimmy boy . I just have a few questions . Like : You realize that 's not a gun , right ? You have no idea what this can do . I 'm on fire ! He 's out the door . Artie says he may have an artifact . I would have to agree . Okay , so there 's two sets of stairs . There 's one on the east corner and one on the west . - We should split up . - I 'll take the east corner . Wait . My men downstairs just broke out of that closet you locked them in . They 're going to meet us on the east stairwell . No , no , no . There may be other traps . You tell them to get out of the building and to call emergency services . Mr. Kosan- - - We 'll wait here while you and Agent Bering check things out . Agent Bering , I 'm going with you . No , ma 'am . It 's too risky . What , you mean like taking the elevator ? That kind of risky ? Well , if you hadn 't zapped my men , we might 've known that the elevators had been compromised . Or you still might all be up on the 40th floor , waiting to die . Or being alerted to danger . I 'm going . End of discussion . If this is a typical snag , bag , and tag , I 'd hate to see what it 's like when things are all fubar . Well , I 've been doing this long enough to always expect the unexpected . Oh , I stay well apprised of you and your partners exploits . The west stairway has been compromised up to the 11th floor . Same thing in the east . Yeah , Stukowksi 's cut off all the exits . Which leaves us with no way down . Well , when you cannot go down , it would appear there 's only one direction left , no ? Emergency services are on their way , but they won 't be much help this high up . There 's a helicopter on its way . E.T.A. 30 minutes . - Excellent . - Thank God . I don 't like that look . I 've seen that look before . Yeah , I know . There 's something not right . We got up here too easily , way too ... easily . Wait here . That 's a reflection of our building . - That is coming fast . - Yeah . We don 't have 30 minutes . What do you mean he got away ? Aquino used some kind of wacky spray-paint can that disintegrated the bank manager 's jacket . That explains the anarchy symbol . What anarchy symbol ? The one that is destroying the structure of this building . Look . Look at this reflection . What are you wasting time talking to us for ? You get the hell out of there . Listen . The elevators are gone . The stairs are a death trap . We are stuck on this roof until a helicopter arrives or the building disintegrates . I 'm pulling for the helicopter . All right , we 'll snag and bag the can . Maybe that 'll stop it . Let 's do that quickly , shall we ? Aquino could be anywhere by now . How are we supposed to find him ? Hey , big brother 's watching . Yes , yes . And so can little sister . I understand , Mr. Kosan . I will do whatever it takes to get the information from her . Godspeed . Will the helicopter make it ? It would appear unlikely . More innocent people , Stukowski . Not so innocent , Jinksy . Now . You 're going to tell us about that spray can and what we can do to stop it . Oh , I never was much of an artist , but I always loved to paint- - Don 't test me , Ms. Stukowski . You used the triangle shirtwaist factory doorknob to torture and then immolate Theodora Stanton . But you 're not the only one who has access to those kinds of artifacts . Ma 'am ? This is not the doorknob , but when it 's finished with you , you 're going to wish it was . That 's from Unit 731 . You 're very well informed . What 's Unit 731 ? Special Japanese military unit during World War II that performed human experimentation and biological warfare research . It 's the medal from Shiro Ishii 's coat . The commander of Unit 731 . This can achieve in a few seconds what would take even the most experienced interrogator days . You 're bluffing . Artie said you don 't torture . I 'm not Artie . Oh--oh , n- - No . You see ? It can simulate drowning . You understand now , don 't you ? You really think you can find him ? Aquino 's on the run . I highly doubt he 's gonna let a red light stop him . What I can do is tap into Atlanta 's traffic cameras , which will flag moving violations . Yeah , got him . Told ya . Well , he 's got an offshore account in the Caymans . I 'll bet he 's headed for one of the airports . Well , he 's not on any commercial--wait . He booked a charter out of Cassaday . That 's private jets only . If he gets wheels up , we 're done . All right , he was at this intersection . Here 's the airport . No , there 's no way we 'll catch him in time . Not necessarily . The Highlander nav system 's off the hook , but Aquino 's car has a notoriously lousy one . Yeah , well , he doesn 't have satellite radio , a backup camera , and ten cup holders , either , but that doesn 't help us stop him from getting on a plane . Claudia , what is that ? Just a little something I whipped up . Prepare to have your mind blown . 'Cause you did not see this coming . Left turn ahead . Proceed west 0.23 miles . Next right and then- - traffic alert . Alternate route advised . Take the next left . Then proceed east 1.5 miles . Talk to me , Sally . You can make this stop . Mrs. Frederic , a word ? What is it , Agent Jinks ? We don 't torture people . Need I remind you of the lives Ms. Stukowski has already taken ? And she will pay for her crimes , but in a court of law , not like this . This is not a democracy , Agent Jinks . Mrs. Frederic , no form of torture has ever yielded credible intel . It 's been statistically proven . Agent Jinks , I have people who are about to die , and that woman has the information I need to free them . Now , if this is the way I have to extract it , so be it . Now , then . Where were we ? Myka . What ? There 's a window-washing rig down on the 15th floor . That could be our ticket out of here . Can we get to it ? A window-washing rig , seriously ? You have a better idea ? How do you propose we get there ? Maybe the corrosion hasn 't reached the 15th floor yet . A chance not worth taking . Oh , for God 's sake . Look , I know that you are the head of security for the Regents . Their lives are in your hands . I get that . I-I do . But our window of opportunity here is closing every second . Now , we can either take this one shot or watch it close . Which would you prefer ? - Let 's move . - Oh , brilliant . I 'd heard you could be rather persuasive , Agent Bering . My dad used to call it bossy . The curse of a natural-born leader . I wouldn 't say that I 'm a natural-born leader . That 's why you were reinstated . You know about that ? Of course I do . You 're meant to be here , Myka . We all are . I 'm not sure I believe in destiny . At a time when we may have felt the least prepared to accept a challenge , the warehouse called upon each of us . You , Artie , me . And we answered that call . If that isn 't destiny , what is ? Mr. Jackson , what 's the status of your men downstairs ? Miller , Stentz . Oh ! - Everybody out . - Everybody up here . Upstairs , come on . Come on , go ! Jane , give me your hand . Oh . Jackson . Give it here . Here . I got you . Agh ! Whatever it takes , you save Philip . Just hold on . You have to save Philip . What are you doing ? Saving you . No ! It 's eating through the structure . We 've got to get to that window-washing rig now . Mr. Jackson understood the hazards of this job , Agent Bering , as do you . But we 're not out of Dodge yet , so cowboy up . Time is running out . How do I stop the paint ? Go to hell . Mrs. Frederic , please . There 's gotta be another way . The Berlin Wall . From the Berlin Wall . Tell me how to stop it . No , I don 't know . Tell me how . I don 't- - I don 't know any- - Please , I ca- - Please , you 're killing- - Please , I can 't . I ca--I can--I- - I 'm sorry , ma 'am . But I can 't let you do this . Stand down , Agent Jinks . No . I may be new , but I know this is wrong , and this is not what we do . Protecting the warehouse is what we do . If you are not up to the task- - Actions have consequences , and this will come back to bite us . Now , Mr. Jinks , we must address the consequences of your actions . Well , it 's not in our database . I mean , I searched Berlin Wall and spray-paint can , and all I got were a bunch of photos of east Germany . Let me see it . Of course . - What ? - For nearly 30 years , the wall was a symbol of oppression . For young East Berliners , the anarchy sign was the ultimate expression of the rebellious spirit . And somehow that spirit gave an ordinary spray-paint can the ability to tear down more than just walls . All right , so you think if we find the can , we can reverse it ? Artie and Myka are still trapped inside . This is bigger than the lives of our people , Agent Lattimer . Get that can , and get back there ASAP . Well , you heard the lady . Reel him in . Take the next left . Proceed ahead 100 feet , and then ... Prepare to be captured . - Cover me , Claude . - On it . Hey , hey , hey ! Jimbo ! It 's over , man . Stay back . Just give me the spray can , and tell me how it works . Forget it , pal . We 're both caught . No , look , we can figure something out . Okay ? Just- - just tell me how it works and how we can stop it . I have no idea . Anyway , you kill me or- - or he does . Who ? Who are you working for ? Man , we can- - we can protect you . You can 't even protect yourselves . Either way , I 'm dead . No , no , no ! No , no , ! Claudia , get the bag . You think that stopped it ? I don 't know . Call Artie . See if it worked . The window-washing rig should be just two floors below us . Yeah . Any luck ? The can is snagged and bagged . Is it--is it over ? No , the building 's still coming down . We 're running out of time . I don 't know , maybe we need to be closer to it . - Yeah . - Okay , guys , just hold on . We 're on our way . - Pete ? - Yeah ? Hurry . We 're already there . - Sir ? - Agh ! - You all right ? - All right . Philip- - where is Philip ? Agh ! Pull it off . - Phil . - Here , Artie , Artie . Don 't touch that ! - Philip , here . Let- - - Don 't . There 's no time . Jane , we must make transfer quickly . What--what- - what are you doing ? - What is that ? - Remati shackle . Genghis Khan went to great and terrible lengths to create it , to make sure that Mongols kept control of Warehouse 7 . It can 't be destroyed by conventional means . No warehouse agent has seen what you are about to witness . The transfer is complete . Mr. Kosan , we have to get out of here now . Let 's go , then . Now . Jane ! We can 't just leave Philip here . Jane , you must . Or all this will be for nothing . My time is over . You are the guardian now . The window-washing rig is ... it 's still there . Oh , thank God . Jane . Jane , we have to go , okay ? Yeah . All right . Hope you have a ladder in there . Lloyd Wright 's pickup sticks . Yeah , Frank 's son used to play with these while watching his father work . He would often copy his designs . This got me out of a bad scrape in Bangkok in ' 94 . Except that was a few pounds ago . I think I 'd better get down there and see if this thing holds . Good luck . Okay , let 's do it . God . Oh , God . All right . Look , he knew the risks . Okay ? And so do you . So cowboy up , lady . 'Cause we 're getting the hell out of Dodge . Come on . Now you , Jane . Adwin , get down that ladder before you pass out . Jane , I 'm fine . You really must- - Go . Hurry . Just be careful . Come down ! We 've gotta- - we 've gotta get this rig up- - up there . It 's no use . Without power , this rig will only go down . Myka , I 'm coming up for you . No , Artie , listen ! There 's not enough time ! Artie , the ladder is already corrupted . I 'm not leaving you ! Go , Artie ! We 'll- - we 'll find another way down . What 's going on up there ? What the hell is that ? Toxic chemical spill . There are people trapped on 17 . Chemicals ? Joe , get downtown on the phone . We 're not equipped to handle a situation this big . There 's nothing you can do . I got a team coming . Just get out of here ! Let 's go , everybody back . What if Jane doesn 't make it ? That is a possibility we cannot entertain . She is the guardian now . She must be rescued . She has to be rescued . No , no , no . Get him to a medic . - She has to be- - - Get him to a medic . Everybody get out of here ! There must be something we can use to lower ourselves down . What would they do if there was a fire ? Fire . Myka , get those elevator doors open . The shaft is clear . Tell me that you 're not suggesting that we jump . There 's two of these on every floor . We can go four floors at a time , all the way down to the basement exit . I 'm impressed . Little trick my husband taught me . What , was he in Die Hard ? Hope you 're not afraid of heights . How did you know ? Okay , I 'm coming ! Artie ! We made it . Artie , where 's Myka ? She and a regent are still up there . You--you left her in there ? How could you just leave- - No , no , Pete , no . There 's nothing you can do . Look . The anarchy symbol . Where 's the spray can ? It 's right here . What , you think we can reverse it ? An artifact that is born of extreme emotion sometimes requires extreme emotion to be triggered , to be neutralized , so I thought if we- - Graffiti . Those German taggers were constantly spraying over each other 's messages . All right , so we spray over Stukowski 's symbol . You think that 'll work ? It 's worth a try . The anarchy symbol represents chaos and destruction . - So paint the opposite . - All right . Well , I 'm in extreme emotion right now . Oh ! Oh . Yes . Oh , thank God I didn 't wear my good shoes . - Just , uh- - - Oh , yeah . - Help me open this door . - Yeah . Okay , if we can get through the basement , there are often underground tunnels that- - Oh , no . Oh . Not exactly the Butch and Sundance moment I was hoping for . More like Thelma and Louise . Oh . Come on , come on ! Keep going , Pete . It 's working . Nice ! Yes , okay . Come on , let 's go get Myka . Come on ! - Ha ! - Oh , my God . Oh . For some reason , I think- - I think that Pete had something to do with this . He 's a good partner . Yes . Sally , Sally , Sally . What was unclear about " Destroy that building and everyone in it " ? I 'm sorry . They had more resources than we thought . And Mrs. Frederic has no trouble crossing the line . Never underestimate the denizens of Warehouse 13 , Sally . You know , they are dangerous people . There is a silver lining , though . You were right about Agent Jinks . He hasn 't drunk the kool-aid yet , and I 've already started working on him . That won 't be necessary . Oh ! I 'm sorry . Hmmm . I 'm sorry , too , Sally . It 'll look like an undetected heart defect . Mm . Marcus , you were right . She wasn 't up to it . I 'll make sure someone finds her . You 're a good friend . Where , where , where ? Where 's Myka ? Myka ! Myka ! Hey , Pete . I 'm- - Hey . I 'm okay . I 'm fine . Hey , I 'm fine . Claudia traced a routing number back to the people we believe hired James Aquino . It 's a company called A to Z Technologies . Whoever they are , they know far more about us than we know about them . An enemy with an arsenal of artifact weapons would not only be dangerous . No , they could be unstoppable . Until we can identify these people behind this A to Z Technologies , we must fortify our defenses . And once we identify them ? Strike . And strike hard . Come on . This was no assassination attempt . The Remati shackle , that was the real target . I 'm afraid so . They were trying to destroy it . Why ? What 's its power ? Protection . In an emergency , that shackle is the last line of defense for Warehouse 13 . Well , that was a crappy day at the office , huh ? What 's going on ? You look like you put down Old Yeller yourself or something . You know , Claude , there is no one that I would rather chase artifacts with than you . Why am I sensing an ugly subtext here ? I was ... T ... insubordinate today . Oh , please . Welcome to my world . No , I 'm serious . It 's complicated . I- - I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic . And , uh , and she fired me . What ? No . N-no . No , no , no . That 's ridiculous . I 'm gonna go talk to her . I 'll just explain to her it was just a misunderstanding . No , don 't . Please don 't . I 'm sorry , Claude , but I can 't do what she want- - I 'm sorry . You know , you 're really not allowed to face death without me . Next time , I promise . And I heard you had to babysit one of the Regents . That must 've been a pain . Actually , she 's kind of kick-ass . Come on , I want to introduce you . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Uh , Jane ? Jane ? Hey , I-I want you to meet my partner . This is Agent Pete Lattimer . Mom . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

 S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 , you have course confirmation . You are cleared direct to the slingshot . Agent Coulson , everything all right up there ? We heard you had a little dustup on the ground . Yeah , we 're all good . It 's gonna be blue skies from here on out . Aah ! Aaaaah ! Coulson ! Hang on ! Hey , no joy rides , okay ? That 's my house . Don 't worry . Where do they think of this stuff ? Skye ? The girl 's not qualified to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent . Agreed . That 's why I 've invited her on as a consultant . S.H.I.E.L.D. Does it all the time . Technically , Stark 's a consultant . Technically , Skye 's a member of the rising tide . She hacked our RSA implementation ... Twice . From a laptop . Imagine what she 'll do with our resources . I am . That 's exactly what I 'm imagining during this frown . You brought me on for risk assessment . She 's a risk . She doesn 't think like us . Exactly . Oh , Agent Coulson told us the news . - What a wonderful surprise . Isn 't it Fitz ? - Yeah . - No , it 's wonderful . - Yeah , it 's a surprise . You must be very excited . Yep , first day of school . Okay , so ... Just ... sorry . Yeah . We have two kids on this bus who aren 't cleared for combat , you 're adding a third . At least Fitz-Simmons are trained S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists . But Skye ? You said this was a select team . Assembled to work new cases , to protect people . I don 't see how letting some hacker tag along ... You 're looking for an objection I haven 't already anticipated . I 'm calling this . But your frown will be on record . We 've been called in to investigate an 0-8-4 . We all know what that means . Yes , we do . It means we don 't know what that means . Officially , it 's an airborne mobile command station . But we call it the bus . We find it best to use shorthand when in the field . But everything has to be just so , you know , because of the danger . Yeah , I 've been up here before , but I didn 't see much because of the bag that Agent Ward put over my head . Yes , so sorry about that . Water ? Wheels up in two . Lock it or lose it . What 's that mean ? No backing out now . Let 's find a bunk for our guest . Oh , oh , yeah , there 's only one left , and it 's right next to mine . Sorry . You can ... Hey , I know we didn 't really ... Might want to read that . This isn 't like other planes . You can say that again . Say what again ? Sweet ride . I earned a little goodwill from Director Fury when I got hit right before the battle of New York . You took a bullet ? An Asgardian stabbed me through the heart with a Chitauri scepter . The effect was similar . Got a few weeks ' R and R and this plane . Had it completely refurbished . Studs up ... spared no expense . Yeah , Agent Ward told me they sent you to Tahiti . It 's a magical place . You mentioned that . Here . Use a coaster . - I 'd buckle up . - I don 't even know where we 're going . Peru . That 's where the 0-8-4 was reported . And an 0-8-4 is ... ? An object of unknown origin . Kind of like you . Team goes in , determines if it 's useful or if it poses a threat . Last one turned out to be pretty interesting . And what was the last one ? A hammer . Tire tracks 40 meters back . I 'll check them against the site 's trucks ... make sure we 're alone . Too much exposure here . I 'm gonna find a place to park . I would love to see a capuchin in the wild . Maybe even a yellow-tailed woolly monkey . You know , um , Peru has 32 different species of monkey . Yeah , and close to 200 species of snakes . The shushupe has a fascinating ven ... venom . It 's neurotoxic , proteolytic , and hemolytic . That 's fascinating . Yeah . Oh . No , I 'd be much more concerned with earthquakes , mala ... Ah . There 's no vaccine for dengue fever . Oh , look at this . We should warn the people who live around here the O-8-4 is dangerous . They 're already dealing with anti-mining rebels and the Shining Path guerrilla 's . I could post something ? Remember the panic when that anti-matter meteor splashed down just off the coast of Miami , - nearly devoured the city ? - No . Precisely . Because we kept it quiet and contained . So , what am I doing ? Well , if it gets out , I might need you to create some kind of diversion , put the public on the wrong scent . So everything that I 'm against . Yep . Good morning , Professor . I 'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. I understand you 've made an interesting discovery . I-I 'm not sure how to explain it . This temple dates back at least 500 years . It 's filled with pre-Incan artifacts . One of them is impossible and looks like it might be dangerous . Well , that 's why we 're here . Watch out . Exactly as we found it . Who else knows about this ? Just the ministry . I believe they are the ones who contacted you . Sir , I need you and your team to evacuate the site until we determine the risk associated with this object . Leave the man alone . Now ... for your own safety . Nothing about this anywhere . It 's amazing . I searched every data stream . What have we got here guys ? Whoa , car ... uh , careful . I-I ... no , wouldn 't do that . The object 's placement in fossiliferous rock formations suggests it 's been here for at least 1,500 years . That pre-dates this temple by a millennium . Ah ! Maybe it 's alien . Yeah , but the shape and the craftsmanship ... it 's almost German . Tires match the prof 's truck . Where 's your sidearm ? If I need a gun , I 'll take one . Right . Forgot I was working with " the cavalry . " Don 't ever call me that . Apologies . I 've heard the stories ... what went down in in Bahrain , about you in action . You know , it was smart of Coulson to pull you out of retirement . It 's nice to have a trusted friend who has your back . Should have taken more guns . - Sir ? - Go . We have a situation . Lots of rebels in this area . Not enough gunfire . Keep working . I 'm on my way . Buenos días . Soy Agente Coulson . Estamos aquí ­ por un asunto de la seguridad internacional . Phillip ? Camilla ? Do you mind ? After you . And now for a proper hello . Comandante ... a promotion . Congratulations . Three years ago . But thank you . Agent Melinda May , Agent Grant Ward , this is comandante Camilla Reyes . She 's with the Policía Millitar del Perú . We used to work together back in the day . Let the team know everything 's okay . I know you 've found a strange object on Peruvian soil . We should have a conversation about how to proceed . Of course . But an 0-8-4 supercedes all national claims . You look good . Yeah , I work out . Come , let me show you something . Are you seeing this ? It 's alive . Wha ... alive alive ? It has a functioning power source . Sleepy 's reading radionuclides , but they don 't match any known isotope . I get temporal matches , but even then , they seem to shift . Is that even possible ? Depends on the shifting of the temporal radio stuff , so ... It 's totally weird , right ? I 'm gonna go check on Coulson . We 've got company . National police . - What ? - Why are they here ? They heard about this object . They 're probably here to protect it . This area has lots of rebel uprisings . Yeah , people are fighting back against the government 's mining policies . It 's pretty kick-ass . Yeah , it 's kick-ass , all the violence . That 's not what I 'm saying . I know it 's what you 're typing , in your van , alone ... where it 's safe . How much longer ? What 's the hurry ? Are we in danger ? Not if everyone does their job . What is yours , exactly ? The cacao is from a secret valley in Peru . Very special . The best chocolate in the world . Could use some sugar . Americans . You know me , Camilla . I 'm a pretty simple guy . There was nothing simple about your last mission here . I had some great help . There isn 't any chance we get to keep the device , is there ? It 's not mine to give , but I 'm sure we can find a way to resolve this respectfully in a way that gives your coun ... - Rebels . - Stay close . On my six . Sound 's like they are engaging with the rebels . Let 's go . - They 're coming for it . - Let 's move ! No . No , no , no , no , no . - It doesn 't matter . - It does to me ! Please , let us do this . We need a containment case for the 0-8-4 . There 's no time . But it has a fluctuating power core ... frequencies way above 10 exahertz . Sorry . Science class is over . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait . You did not just pull that out of the wall . What is the matter with you ? ! Do you realize we do not know the amount of photon emissions coming out of this ... Okay . We don 't know what will happen if it gets excited . - Stay close . - Fitz ! Come on ! Your men need to fall back now , or we 'll never make the runway . Now ... your truck . Let 's go ! Get back ! Tell your men to get down . Anzuelo ! My truck ! Vámonos ! Get in ! Get in ! Move ! Now ! - Yes . - Yeah , that 's a good idea . After you . After you . Coulson 's secure in PMP 's truck . - Take the South route to the airfield . - Gotcha . Slow down ! You 're joking , right ? Well , listen we have to be careful there 's a binding energy structure that could overheat . I could roll down a window ! Aah ! Do not roll down a window ! Stay quiet and keep your heads down . Head left . The ravine empties . But , Ward ! Quiet ! How fast can you have the wheels up ? Fast . - Ramp ! - I 'm on it . What are you doing ? ! Coulson is still out there ! Get off the ramp . You 're in the line of fire . Cut it pretty close , sir . Didn 't want to leave anyone behind . I got to say it . I miss my van . Now , what was the problem ? As I said before , this device has a high-frequency , fluctuating , sub-material compression ... Fitz , in English . The 0-8-4 is fueled by tesseract technology . HYDRA . World War 2 . Captain America . It 's full of lethal amounts of gamma radiation . Gamma ... you 're saying it 's nuclear ? No . He 's saying it 's much , much worse . And the 0-8-4 is in your possession ? It 's on board and contains a tesseract fuel cell , so ... there 's that . Copy . You are a go for check-in guidance through restricted airspace . Safe travels . Top speed 's a priority , May . Obviously . I know you didn 't want to see combat . I apologize for that . Do you need anything else before I go check on the device fueled by evil that 's sitting in our cargo hold ? This was fun . Not to worry . The device is stable . Not that it couldn 't explode at any minute , especially if hit with machine-gun fire . But things like this happen from time to time when in the field , and at first , it 's very unpleasant , and you regret your decision to leave the lab at all . Are you mental ? I did explain in great detail exactly what I meant , using the queen 's bloody English ! I use normal English ... words like " duck " and " run " and " might blow us to pieces . " Oh . Oh ! Wow , wow , congratulations , Agent Ward . You managed to string three words together in a sentence . Is everyone all right ? Banged up but alive . Thank you for the extraction . But we lost a lot of men . We 'll make sure the rest of you get home safe . Are we safe ? On a plane with that ? There 's a PMP airfield in Iquitos . It 's a short distance ... we 'll burn as fast as we can for a S.H.I.E.L.D. Containment facility . There 's no safer place for us to go . Sir , if I may ? You got anything to drink around here ? Upstairs . I think you 'll find it quite comfortable up there . - I expect the grand tour . - I know you do . - It was an evacuation , we would have been fine ! - Don 't understand anything you are saying ! Do we have a problem in here ? No , sir . Just working on our communication . Not everyone was prepared for a firefight . We got out , didn 't lose anyone , saved a few of theirs ... I 'd say we did all right . Anything else ? Uh , yeah . I have a small question . Because I 've been feeling like the tagalong hayseed rookie , but now I get the sense that Ward doesn 't know which one 's Simmons and which one 's Fitz , and they 've seen even less gunfire than me , and I 'm no rocket Scientist , but is this your first mission together ? No . Of course not . It 's our second . I was your first ? That 's sweet . You 're amused ? I 'm terrified . I am in way over my head , but I have been on this team just as long as any of you . I might as well be team captain . I was joking , but maybe that 's not a bad idea , because these guys do not like each other much . This isn 't about that . I 'm a specialist . Today , I could have eliminated the enemy threat myself if I was working alone , but I had non-combat-ready agents ... Whoa , whoa , wait , you work alone ? So typical . Who do you think designs your equipment ? - Or the polymers for your weaponry . - Yeah , try going into ... - People like us do it . - The field with just your bare bum . See them proving the point I just made ? You 're not wrong . We still need to iron out the kinks . But , Ward , you can speak six languages . Simmons , you have two PHD 's in fields I can 't pronounce , and , Fitz , you are a rocket scientist . So work it out . I-I 'm ... I 'm good at stuff , too . So , should we work or just continue to ... I 'm saying I said there would come a moment when we would regret the decision to go in the field . I didn 't think that would happen in week one . Oh , God . This seam in the sedimentary layers suggests some sort of molten cave-in a few decades back . Yeah , well , this here ... it 's optical amplification . Now , I think ... well , I 'm most likely dead-on ... that the tesseratic energy excites plasma with an inverse population of energy levels . A laser . A ray of ... pure energy ... two terajoules . See the amplifier ? We 're lucky the drones didn 't trigger it while we were taking electromagnetic readings . This is a weapon , powerful enough to ... enough to melt through 50 feet of solid rock to bury itself . Imagine what it could do to a person . Yeah , or an airplane . For example . " Hunger Games " ? " Matterhorn . " One of a hundred books my S.O. Gave me that I 'm just getting around to . S.O ... Supervising officer . Got it , hackers have lingo , too , but I 'll pick yours up . I feel like you and me ... wrong foot . Can I ... buy you a drink ? What I said before ... when I said the uprising was ... whatever I said ... a good thing . I don 't want you to think I am oblivious . What I was talking about was the tweets . Tweets . You trying to make things better or worse ? Peruvians have organized for the first time in decades . Thousands of suffering people who have never met uniting over a common idea ? It 's mind-blowing . And I don 't want to bring it up because I don 't want to see your hate face , but ... that 's what the Rising Tide is all about . Okay . Usually , one person doesn 't have the solution . But 100 people with 1 % of the solution ... that 'll get it done . I think that 's beautiful ... pieces solving a puzzle . You and I see the world differently is all . I 've never been in a war zone during a war until today . That was crazy . I take it you 've seen that a lot ? Wh ... did you get shot ? Skin deep . Nothing to worry about . You got shot . Did that happen protecting us ? Said don 't worry about it . Well , no wonder you were so pissed . I wasn 't pissed . I was trained to be the whole solution ... to eliminate variables . And today , they keep adding up . We 're turning . We 've entered restricted airspace . So we have to follow certain flight paths ... regulation . This plane is capable of fully automated flight , but May has to be on the stick herself tonight . You 've got an S.O. May 's got to be on the stick . Lots of good lingo on this plane . Yeah . We just can 't seem to understand each other . First walkie-talkie wristwatch ... 1936 , Poland . They only made 20 , I think . Still works . I forgot you 're such a sentimentalist , Phillip . Romanticizing history . Yeah , most of it 's glued down . There was an elegance to things back then . There we agree . With everything around us changing so quickly , it doesn 't hurt to have a few touchstones to the past . Reminds me what 's important . The last thing I want to do is relive days gone by . A few nights , maybe . I see what you 're doing . I 'm reminiscing . This plane is such a step up from the R.V. We used to work out of when you were stationed in Cusco . I don 't remember much working . I also don 't remember you being this direct . Skye , hand me the bottle . Okay , turbo , but you 're still nursing the one you got . I 'm not the only one . We 're stuck above the clouds for the next few hours . We might as well enjoy ourselves . We could make a few more memories to add to your collection . What do you think ? I think Ward already knows ... you 'll have to eliminate May from the equation ... to have a chance . Which gives him about 20 seconds to get to her first . Aah ! We were allies . We had history . When did you decide to throw that away ? As soon as I saw your team . The reason I 'm still alive is because you need me to verify the change of routes for your pilot when H.Q. Calls in any minute now . - I 'd appreciate that . - But if I don 't , S.H.I.E.L.D. will shoot this aircraft out of the sky . That 'll take the 0-8-4 out of your hands . Maybe I should let them . Oh , no , I think you 'll make the call . You already handed me your plane for the life of one of your little lab rats . If I open the cargo hold , you 'll lose them all . And you are such a sentimentalist . This is my fault . Should have learned kung fu . Oh , yeah , but I shouldn 't have pushed you into the field in the first place . You weren 't ready . It was my job to make a proper threat assessment . This wouldn 't have happened if Agent May wasn 't on the stick . She would have busted out some of her ninja know-how . Agent May ? No . No , no . She transferred from administration . Well , I 've seen her destroy a guy , so ... You 've heard of the cavalry ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Wh ... everyone at the academy talks about st ... She 's the cavalry ? I told you never to call me that . I can 't believe it ! Oh , we 're sure to get out of here now . Um , how do we get out of here ? Can 't go through the doors . They 're bolted , tied to the pressurization lines . You two geniuses have nothing ? Yeah , well , it 's hard to concentrate in these intense situations . Hey . Don 't freeze up . Take a breath . You don 't need to come up with the whole solution . Just part of it . Right ? Yeah . Pieces solving a puzzle . You knew this was a weapon all along . But you got to it first . I had to play nice . Yes , Coulson . For once , I 'm actually ahead of you . My country commissioned that weapon decades ago . After the fall of HYDRA , many scientists followed their Nazi friends to hide on this side of the world . German engineering . The weapon was lost during a clash in the jungle until today . With it , we 'll end the rebel uprising and finally stabilize my country . You mean rule your country . You stay in your borders . I 'll stay in mine . Those borders are disappearing . Aliens descended on New York , remember ? They don 't care whose colors you wear . They just care who 's in the way . We should be working together , not fighting . Well , that 's clearly the worst idea we 've heard yet . But it could work . Reyes is gonna kill us the minute we land , regardless , blame it on rebels . This way , we have a fighting chance . I 'll take it . What 's first ? We can 't get upstairs without going in the lab . And the only way to release the lab doors is from upstairs . The first thing is , we 're tied to the cargo door , so unless you can ... What the hell was that ? Her wrist . Aah ! What 's next ? Was it 11 years ago , now ? You swooped in with S.H.I.E.L.D. with so much confidence , so much mystery . You had 100 men at your disposal . - And now ... - A hand-picked team . And , yes , they 're that good . Oh , Phil . You 're not even aware . Your renewed idealism , your collectibles , your airborne man cave , surrounding yourself with young , attractive agents ... you 're having a mid-life crisis . More an afterlife thing , really . And I 'm not going to even mention the red corvette . Her name 's Lola . Of course it is . That 's textbook . You built this team so you could feel relevant , to feel needed . They don 't need me . They need time . Well , time is not on their side . No , but you gave them something better ... a common enemy . Okay , we 're sure , right ? Everyone 's sure ? - We 're all on board . - Yeah , let 's do this fast . No turning back . No freezing up . Because if we do , then ... - All of us die . - We know . All right . You guys talk a lot . No , no , no ! S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 , we have radar contact . Requesting confirmation on a change in course , over . Answer it , or they all learn what a 30,000-foot drop feels like . Agent Coulson , are you there ? You have course confirmation . You are cleared direct to the slingshot . Agent Coulson ? Everything all right up there ? We heard you had a little dustup on the ground . Yeah , we 're all good . It 's gonna be blue skies from here on out . Simmons , forget what I said before . This is the moment that we 'll regret . Aah ! Aaaaah ! - It worked ! - The drop in cabin pressure released the doors . I 'll take care of the soldiers . You guys get to the 0-8-4 . And Coulson ? Let 's hope he can handle himself . Aah ! Aah ! Get back ! Go now ! Find the 0-8-4 ! Help ! - Coulson ! - Got you ! Hold on ! It 's okay . I 've got it ! - Fitz ! - We got it , reel us back in ! I 've got you ! What are you doing ? We need your help ! Trust me ! I don 't want you to know what a 30,000-foot drop feels like . Aah ! Aah ! Fitz ! Cut him loose ! - Sorry ! - Sorry , Ward ! Hold on ! Aah ! I read the safety pamphlet . You might be the first . No other way in , huh ? Was just starting to warm up to this place . The 0-8-4 is cooling and stable . But we should call H.Q. and get it to the slingshot as soon as possible . Told you they were good . Not a scratch . But your plane 's totaled . I hope S.H.I.E.L.D. insurance covers hijackings . Sure . Under " incidentals . " What exactly am I signing up for ? Like I said , front-row seat to the craziest show on earth . Yeah , but I didn 't expect the show to get this crazy , this fast all for an object you 're just gonna destroy . Slingshot is protocol . A weapon like the 0-8-4 is too dangerous for any person or country to have . People like Reyes would always be after it . What happened with Reyes , anyway ? She 's being held at a S.H.I.E.L.D. Detainment facility . I expect the Peruvian government will negotiate for her release . She probably won 't spend much time in jail . No , I mean what happened with you and Reyes ? You guys totally did it back in the day , right ? That 's classified . Looks like Skye might end up as more than just a consultant , despite our reservations . She could turn into a solid asset ... With some serious work . Well , if she wants to be a field agent , she 'll need a supervising officer ... someone disciplined , someone good . All right . I 'll do it . Just to clarify , you were , uh , talking about me , right ? We blew up a plane . I had a new experience . Eat that , Professor Vaughn . You had a new experience . But it was new for all of us . They 're happy . Hey , come on . You guys don 't want to miss this . So , it 'll take about 180 days to reach the sun . Now , yes , of course , it would have been faster if they 'd used hydrogen-fueled APU 's , but they 're having fun . How many of those have you guys had ? Sk ... Skye . It 's important when in the field to unwind from time to time . Yeah , yeah , especially after a hard day of everyone almost dying . Which doesn 't happen every day , right ? It 's an anomaly ... an irregularity . Not ... the norm . Speaking of " not the norm , " whose idea was it to blow a hole in the plane ? May said that the doors were tied to the pressurization . So I thought ... So we thought it was the only way to release them . It was everyone 's idea , sir . Yes , quite genius , really . Nice work . All clear for liftoff . Oh , time for blastoff . Launching ... In three two ... The trajectory will take it beyond the Lagrange point so that it doesn 't hit Herschel . And there haven 't been any coronal mass ejections , so it shouldn 't lose telemetry . Guys , English . Ow . Really ? Really , Coulson ? Six days ? It only took you six days to take a completely renovated piece of state-of-the-art machinery and turn it into scrap ? ! My team acted with my authority . Don 't talk to me about authority . Do you know how much this plane cost ? It 's got a bar . A really nice one . Talking to me about authority . You know , I have the authority to downgrade your ass to a Winnebago . I 'm aware of that , sir . Well , I want it fixed just like you found it . So don 't have Fitz-Simmons going making modifications , like a-a-a-a ... Damn fish tank . Yes , sir . And the new girl ... she 's a risk . I know , sir . You know , sir ? How 's Lola ? She 's fine , sir . Thanks for asking . Talking to me about authority . Yeah , we 're gonna have to kill the fish tank .

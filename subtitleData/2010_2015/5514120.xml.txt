 Dare to come near me ? Game . - Alvarez , you are so hardheaded . - What ? Didn 't I tell you to wait for back up . Weren 't you the back up . This is the third time , this month , you violated direct orders from the Chief ... from the Chief Gabriel . Lee , we have to go there . Co 'z if not , they 'll get the tech and everybody will die . Where are the hostage scientists ? Secured.They 're in level 6 . Where 's the tech ? Oh no , Lee . Shit ! Alvarez . What ? I think I dropped it . Let the back-up go back for it . No , because if we weren 't able to retrieve it ... we 'll be doomed in the agency and I 'll get all the blame . If you don 't want to come , stay here . Suicide ? Ready ? This 'll be a box of Johnny Walker . Blue . Deal . Lee . Alvarez ! Alvarez ... Alvarez , you are so hardheaded . This is the last time you 're disobeying orders . No rescue and retrieval without back-up . Hostages before agents . Agents before hostages . - Chief ... - Confirm before action . Mind over gun . What will I do with your great skills if you 're hardheaded ? Chief , his name is Michael . He was here . I almost got him . Alvarez , this is not your personal battle . This is us versus the agency . This is us protecting our fellow scientists and inventors . Us . Not just you . But if I can get him . But , you did not get him . And if you got him . Will be able to bring back your partner 's life ? No . And it wouldn 't bring back your parent 's life either . You 're fired . Chief ! Alright you 're suspended . Miri , you have to let go . And if you can 't do that , then you 're useless to the team . Chief ! Go back to Manila . Rest . That 's an order . 'Nana ... Arrange our staff house in Manila . Let 's go . Yllana ... give me a lead on this and a trace . Then report to me immediately . You 're suspended , right ? How many neck do you have ? One . You want me to make it two ? I 'll break it . Where did you get this bullet ? Lee 's chest . Who 's the greatest ? Sister Miri . Sister Miri . Why did you leave me ? Because you 're slow . This is heavy . Help me . Limnonectes magnus . There . That 's Limnonectes magnus . The giant Philippine frog . Large swamp frog or Mindanao fanged frog ... it is a species of frog in the Ranidae family . Hey , are you listening ? Sister Miri , can I have that . Sure . If you 'll get ahead of me . Sister Miri , wait for me . Andrew , did you see the kids ? I saw them playing there a while ago . They must be just around . 669' Dra . Miriam . Did you see my kids ? Who ? Mark and Wm ? You know those kids , I 'd always look for them every morning . They 're just around . You know Miri likes to go everywhere . Did you get all that we need ? Yes . Complete ? Almost . Almost , actually . I 'll go back for the other one . I can 't help you . Yeah , this is heavy . It 's okay , I can handle it . I 'll go ahead . aka ) ' - Okay . See you . Joan . Miriam , when are we going to do my suggestion ? Joan , I reviewed the results . It 's too dangerous to try . We 've been testing with birds , rats and frogs . Miriam , my computations are right as long as the person we 'll use has strong mind ... good disposition and intelligent . We won 't have a problem . Where will we get a genius who can take this experiment ? You . I don 't like . Then it 's Andrew . Are you sure ? Or me . I thought we need one with strong mind , good disposition and intelligent ? I told you to just be a dermatologist . Dermal ? What an insult . Derma ? Miriam ... if those who has ﬂat nose can get a nose lift , those aging gets a face lift ... it 's about time that morons have IQ lift , right ? You 're insane , Joan . It 's not that easy . But seriously , we tested your children . And of both of them , one of them is super genius . I 'm sure they can handle everything . 0 Miri , where are you going ? Where did you leave your brother again ? Ready , mom ? I 'll turn it on . Okay . On my mark . All set . 3,2,1 ... A bit stable . The images are clean . You can clearly see the bird 's memory . You 're corrections are just right , Greg . Subject 87 . Check . That 's actually 97 % of the test subjects . We can start in human subjects . Me . I can volunteer . Miri . I 'll freeze you like an ice candy . The problem is that we need to do the human test in our laboratory in Manila . But we don 't trust the agency . The agency has spies . And if we 're not cautious ... Wait , wait , wait . Don 't we like it ? The agency has equipment and money . They can help us . Right ? We can do everything . Greg , this is our research . We know that you want to do everything fast . We do , too . But we don 't trust the agency . That 's why we 're here because we don 't want them to know what we 're doing and where are we . Now that everything 's perfect , right ? That 's why we need the agency more than ever , right ? To fast track our experiment . Think of those who are in dying . We can preserve them while they 're waiting for their medicine or organs . But with the wrong hands , this can be used to drag information from your brain ... whether you like it or not . Hold it . I know we can download to a person . But I didn 't know that we could upload it to another body . That 's what Miriam 's working on right now . But this experiment , it 's already perfect , right ? Everything 's there . Okay . I 'll go ahead . I 'll see you all in Manila . Why don 't you wait ' til morning ? I 'd be doing a lot of important things in the lab . Is Joan going to ride with you ?

What 's that ? Melon . How can you tell if it 's ripe or not ? Give it to me . Smell it . How can you tell if it 's ripe if you won 't smell it . Does it smell good ? Is that your phone number ? No .

I can 't promise that . But I 'm trying . What if he 's coming with you ? He wants to become one of the agents . Mark ? Mark has no ambition at all . Maybe that 's better than being a bartender . At least in bartending there 's a happy hour . Free drinks . Cocktail drinks . Let the kids in , quickly . Hand me your bags . What happened ? Hurry " P - Hurry . Okay , get in . Have a seat . Just sit there . Let me see . Oh my God . Get water . Hurry " P - What happened ? I 'll just check outside . Elaine , when we came there , the whole camp 's clean . But there 's a huge explotion . We suspected that the van was burned . My God , how about Miriam ? Elaine we can 't tell what happened to her . Everything was burned . I 'm sure the agency got there first . We recovered a few clips . It 's confirmed that the gun is from the couple . By the way , we saw these kids ... along the highway . Poor kids . Where 's Joan and Greg ? No sign of them .

 - All right , Slate . Show time . - You sure you don 't wanna go for a swim ? - Tariq told me to tell you come back with the gold or don 't come back at all . - Well , I don 't think we gotta worry about Tariq . - No one 's ever found anything down there before . What makes you think you 're any different ? - Well , the Blue hole is a bottomless pit . Not even Cousteau can swim the bottom . But I can . And he didn 't have these . - Sonars , guns , and C4 . You 're gonna bury yourself underthe sea floor and silt . - Well , then I won 't have to deal with Tariq , will I ? You 'll have to face him alone and without the gold . ( heavy breathing ) - Hey , mon , it 's getting cold over here . - Let 's keep going . The shelf 's straight ahead . ( Sonar pinging ) - It 's not working . - All right , let 's head down . - I don 't like this at all . - How much farther ? - I 'm gonna look for a spot to set the charges . It 's where it 's buried . Cortez should be right underneath it . ( static ) - Okay , come here . Bring me the charges . I 'll plant a few charges here . You guys set the perimeter . I need you goin ' off to the left . - Let 's go . All right , mon. we are set over here . - That 's what I like . ( chuckles ) ( beeps ) ( explosion ) ( shouts ) ( screams ) ( growling ) - Whoa !

Just wait . - Just wait for what ? - Yeah , I may or may not have a little surprise in store . But it 's perfectly safe . Trust me . - Why do I need to be reassured that it 's safe ? - Come on . Can you just chill out ? Relax and enjoy the view . Look where we are . This is amazing . It 's gorgeous . - We are gonna have so much fun . - I know . Come on . Let 's get checked in . - Sarah ! - Hi , Henry . How are you ? - Good , good . - Good . - Today is going to be a beautiful day . You heading back out to the barrier reef today ? - Um , it depends . You available ? I need some samples for the lab . - I 'm actually taking ' a couple out here in the boat an hour . Just snorkeling ' , though . But I 'm free for diving this afternoon . One p.m. work ? - One p.m. is perfect . - Good . See you then . - Babe , let 's go ! - I 'm coming . - Ready ? - Yeah . So why didn 't we spend the week on the mainland again ? - You didn 't like the Mayan ruins ? - No , I liked it . It 's just seven days of nonstop hiking is not my idea of a vacation . - You helped me plan this trip . Okay , fine . You get to choose all the things we do next time . - Oh , what makes you so sure there 's gonna be a next time ? We ought to stay here and hang out with the locals . - Really ? You 're hilarious , you know that ? Are you ready to snorkel or what ? ( fog horn blares ) - Henry , right ? - Rod , yes . - Hi , I 'm Jane . - Hey , nice to meet you guys . - Nice to meet you too . I hope we 're not late . - Not at all . So you guys ready to go snorkel at the Blue Hole ? - Yeah , man , yeah . We 're both really excited . - The Blue Hole ? - Yes , the Blue Hole . Welcome on board . - Thanks . - Yes . - So who here has gone snorkeling before ? Not like this , you haven 't . Snorkeling at the Lighthouse Reef is unlike snorkeling anywhere else on earth . And if you 're really daring , you can swim across the Blue Hole . Most people are not . Now the ride to the reef is about an hour from here . So I suggest you just relax and enjoy the ride . - What is the Blue Hole ? - It 's a huge sinkhole about three foot five feet across . And six down . - And you knew about this ? - You 're gonna love it . You 're gonna love it . - You 're gonna love it . - Turn on some music , Jibuti . ( reggae music plays ) - Going to be a lot of fun . I want to know your name what 's your number ? ♪ Girl , I really , really wanna get to know ya ♪ Baby girl , I want to know your name ♪ Sexy lady ♪ Como te llamas ♪ I want to know your name- - ♪ - This is insane . I 've never seen anything like it . - This hole is huge . - Is that a shark ? - Just tiger sharks , then bull sharks . - Rod ? - I 'm just kidding . ( chuckles ) Those are nurse sharks . They 're totally harmless . - Then what 's that spear for ? - Customers who don 't pay . ( chuckles ) - Henry ! Help ! - Henry ! - Henry ! - Hurry ! Come quick ! - Henry ! - Henry ! - Henry , there 's a body in the water ! - Look at that . - Come here ! You 're not gonna believe this ! Come on , come on ! Hurry up ! - There 's someone over there . - Here , take these . Saw a body out there floating . One guy . I don 't know if he 's conscious , unconscious or what . - We gotta get him out of the water . Start the engine . There he is . Give me a hand with this . - Is he alive ? - He 's breathing , barely . He 's got a pulse . It 's kind of weak . He probably had a concussion , maybe even the bends . We probably better get him to a hospital . - No , no hospitals . - We can take him back to our place . - Well , shouldn 't a professional come and look at him ? - I know someone we can call . - Oh. what do you make of that ? - Why them boy take so long ? They should have been back by now . Find out what happened . Slate double-crossed me again . This time , he must pay with his life . - Let 's go . ( groans ) - Hey , guys , he 's waking up . - Where am I ? Who are you guys ? - We found you out there by the reef barely breathing . We gave you CPR . But wasn 't sure if you were gonna make it for a second there . - You gave me CPR ? - You woke up just long enough to say " no hospitals " . So we brought you back here to this hotel . I 'm Sarah , this is Henry . He called me from the boat to meet you . And this is their place . They were on the boat with Henry . Thanks , you guys . I 'm Jackson . Most people just call me Jacks . - All right , Jacks . How 's the head ? - Drink the local fruit wine , you 'll figure it out . I think I 'll survive . - So you wanna tell us what happened out there ? - Uh , not really , no . - What about this ? You wanna tell us about this ? ( grunts ) - Now I am going to ask you one more time . Where is Tariq 's money ? - I don 't know . ( grunts ) Oh , man , you been workin ' out . I actually felt that one . Ah ! ( gunshot ) Hey ! Hey ! - Now I 'm going to ask you one more time . Where is Tariq 's money ? - We didn 't find anything , all right ? We went into the jungle . There was no Mayan gold . No nothing , just death . - I tell you what I think . I think that you found exactly what you were looking for and decided to keep it for yourself . and kill our men ! You better start making sense . Then where is it ? - It 's at the bottom of the Blue Hole . - What the hell are you talking about ? - I 'm talking about Spanish gold . ( laughter ) - He 's talking about Mayan gold , the gold that the Governor Cortez stole from the native people . No one has found it . No one knows where it is . - I know where it is . - All right , but I warn you . You try anything , Slate , anything at all , I will put a bullet in your head and bury you in that hole myself . - Okay , I get it , I get it . I found it snorkeling . It 's amazing what people leave behind , huh ? - You mean , like the Mayans ? - I dove to the bottom of the Blue Hole . - You went to the bottom ? what else did you find ? Hey , look , man . You don 't have to tell us anything you don 't want to . But I 'm sure the police will find this all pretty interesting . - Well , I don 't wanna involve you guys in anything too dangerous . But if you really wanna know ... Get me a beer and let 's go outside . ( phone rings ) - Yes , boss ? - Any sign of them boys ? - No , boss , but the port here around the Blue Hole shut down and are locked . The Coast Guard in there . They find a boat missing . Wreck smashed off the rocks . Passengers presumed dead . What else you want me to do ? - I want you to keep looking until you find them , or their bodies . - Yes , boss . Raul , let 's go . - So you 're saying you owe this Tariq guy a lot of money and you were gonna pay him off with the gold ? - Oh , forget Tariq . As far as he knows , I 'm already dead . That gold 's still out there . Tell you what . I 'm willing to cut you in if you guys help me find it . - Aren 't you forgetting something ? Someone out there did kill those men . And if it wasn 't you , then we should be worried about who or what . - What do you mean , or what ? - I mean , right now we don 't know anything . But Dr. Jones here has been setting off charges in Blue Hole . So who knows what the hell he 's unearthed ? - What exactly are you saying ? - I 'm saying I 'm in . I don 't care about the Spanish gold or lost treasure . I just wanna know what 's out there . - I care about the gold . - Yes , me too . - Rod ? - Count me in . Listen , we came out here to dive that hole anyways . And now I see more reasons to go ... a lot more . I say we go for the gold . - The police will be patrolling the air between here and the reef . - Well , we 'll have to go the long way around . Half Moon Key , huh ? Help me with the rest of this . ( phone rings ) - Any sign of Edric and the others ? - No , boss , only Slate . And he 's going out with some different people . None of we people . - That bastard has double-crossed us for the last time . You know what to do ! - Yes , boss , and the rest of them ? - No witnesses , not one to tell the tale . - Yes , boss . When they curl Half Moon Key , we 're gonna wait for them . Let 's go . - Rod ? A word ? Are we seriously going through with this ? I mean , I don 't wanna die on some wild goose chase for some lost treasure . Did you forget the part where some gangsters are trying to kill him ? Or , like she said , there could be something out there that 's even worse than them . Stop acting like you 're in " The Goonies " . ( chuckles ) - " The Goonies " ? Listen . I think that you need to calm down . Change your mind and come with us . It 's gonna be a lot of fun . - No , Rod , I want us to stay together . Otherwise , I 'm gonna go back to the hotel and you can have your little adventure on your own . - Listen , I hear you . I just think it 's a little bit too late for that . We 're already set , loaded up , and ready to go . There could be a lot of gold out there . - Look , if you go on that dive , I 'm gonna be really upset . - I 'm gonna go . We 'll see you back at the hotel , okay ? - Is it just me ? The woman doesn 't look too happy with you . - Yep . - Don 't worry . She 'll be a lot happier when you bring back the gold , huh ? - That 's the plan . - Raul , here they come ! See them there ? Get ready for the shot ! Now remember , when they get close , we 'll pull up side of them . I say hello and then goodbye . ( rumbling ) - Whoa ! - Something out there ! Something big ! ( growling ) - Start up the boat , boy ! Start up the boat ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on , boy ! - I 'm trying ! ( gunfire ) ( screaming ) - Hurry , boy , hurry ! ( gunshots , screaming ) - Hey ! You guys see that up ahead ? There ! - Hey , there 's some wreckage out there ! Check that out , take me to it . - Just like before . Another wrecked boat with no sign of survivors . Not even any bodies . - What the hell is goin ' on ? - This is the Coast Guard . Remain where you are ! - Damn ! - Great . We got visitors . - Prepare to be boarded . You people wanna tell me what the hell you 're doing out here ? You got a name ? - Who 's asking ? - Cut the bullshit . I wanna know who you people are and what you are doing at the Blue Hole . - Blue Hole ? - Don 't play dumb with me . That boat of yours had a registered dive out at the hole at nine this morning . And then there 's this . You fancy yourselves some kind of treasure hunter ? - Look , you can 't keep us here . We haven 't done anything wrong . - Where do you think you are ? You think this is the U.S. ? I 've got two boats destroyed . Covered in blood . Maybe you did find something . And maybe you killed your friend over it . - Okay , look . My name 's Jackson Slate . I was diving the Blue Hole to see what I could salvage . The last thing I remember , there was an earthquake . When I came to , these people rescued me . We decided to come back out here and investigate . And that 's when we found this . - Look , we 've got a real problem here and I think you know damn well it isn 't us . - In all my years working these parts , I have never seen anything like this . - Oh , my God ! - Let alone twice in one goddamned day . Not even drug runners . - This wasn 't drug runners . This was bitten off by something big , something really big . - Whatever it is , it 's big enough to tear a dive boat to shreds . - We need to have an advisory and tell the people to stay out of the water . - We need to go into that Blue Hole . Think about it . This all started after he went down there . Maybe he disturbed something . We need to khow what we 're dealing with while we can still do something about it . - All right , Slate . Look like you get to go back and hunt for your lost treasure after all . - Yeah . What about .. . - Sorry . Property of Belize . - At least you know where there 's more . - Any word from Rafa and Raul ? - Nothing yet , big man . - If they are not back by sundown , I 'll find Jackson Slate myself and skin him and his friends alive ! ( cocks gun ) - So , Jackson , you left out a few details when you were talking to the police . What do you think really happened down there ? - Honestly , I think Tariq 's guys blew the charges early and left me for dead . But somebody came back and took care of them . I 'm sure you got a different theory . - Yeah . All I know is there 's something out there destroying boats . And we just happen to be on a boat . - These guys got plenty of gun power and sonar . Anything comes at ' em , I 'm sure they 'll take care of it . - Tell me , how did you get involved with those low-life gangsters anyway ? And were you really gonna pay them back the gold ? - Of course ... probably . - Probably not . ( chuckles ) - Well ... I put my hand around your waist ♪ Girl , you 're feeling so nice ♪ When I look into your eyes ♪ Girl , you got me hypnotized ♪ There 's just something about you , girl ♪ Whenever I 'm around you , girl ♪ Como te llamas ♪ I want to know your name What 's your number ♪ Girl , I really , really wanna get to know ya ♪ - What 's goin ' on , beautiful ? - Hello , sweetheart . - Hey , what 's up , guys ? - Oh , nothin ' . We 're just down here in Belize for training right now . Just kind of drinkin ' , relaxing ' . Kickin ' with the locals . I don 't know if you 're interested . But my buddy , he 's got a boat right down the beach . You wanna join us ? - A boat ? - Yeah . Would you like to see it ? - Uh , no , I shouldn 't . - Aw , come on . You can lay out . And we 'll drink tons of champagne , have some caviar . - You guys are full of shit . - You 'll never know unless you go . - All right , yeah . So what kind of boat is this ? - Sure you boys don 't wanna go for a swim ? - Sure you boys don 't wanna go for a swim ? - Ha ! I don 't get paid enough to do anything this crazy . - All right . Well , just keep a lookout , will you ? - Good luck . - Thank you . You afraid of the dark ? - Not of the dark . Just what 's in it . - I told you what 's in it . Spanish gold . - Woo-hoo ! Yeah , baby . - Or in some people 's opinion , Mayan gold . Gotta tell you , it 's not what 's in it that you gotta be afraid of . When you get down to about 200 feet , the pressure 's gonna be so bad it 's gonna make your chest feel like it 's gonna explode . Get down to 300 , nitrogen narcosis kicks in , you 're gonna feel dizzy . You 're gonna think that you might be seeing some things . But it 's nothing compared to when you get down to 400 feet . - You know what , Jacks ? why don 't you save it ? - You panic and come up too fast , you 're gonna die . So just breathe normal and don 't panic . If any of you guys feel like you need to back out now , now 's the time to tell me . ( chuckles ) - Jacks , I 'm not really one to back out of things ever . But I think it 'd be a good idea to keep a man onboard and keep an eye on things . Make sure you guys are safe while you 're down there diving . So I think I 'm gonna sit this one out , huh ? - Yeah , sure . - Hey , hey ! I 'll still get my cut , though , right ? - Yeah . - All right . You 're a good man . Good luck , man . ( sonar pings ) - Shelf 's right up ahead here . Get ready to go down . Is everyone all right ? - Getting deeper now . ( static ) - There 's the Cortez in her final glory . Okay , you guys follow me , all right ? Let 's go forward . - Okay , I 'll follow you . - See those ? - These are dinosaur footprints , I think ! Look at the eggs ! We 've got to take one back to the lab ! - Okay . I 've seen enough . Let 's get outta here . ( screams ) - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - Relax . You all right ? Okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm good . - You guys all right ? You were down there for a long time , ma 'am . I thought we lost you . - You nearly did . - Yeah . We ran into my old crew down there . They were torn apart , trampled or something . - What else did you guys see down there ? - We saw footprints , big ones . - Well , did you see what left them ? - No , but we found this . - What the hell 's that ? - It 's what I intend to find out . - The advisory is still in effect . Stay out of the water . - I better go try to find Jane . She 's probably worried about me . - I still give you guys a ride to the mainland once he opens up the harbor . - Hey , Jacks . Wanna come back to the lab with me ? I could use an assistant . - Uh , sure . - Great . - Hey , you still owe me a refund for that ride , man . - Hey , I did take you guys out . You know where to find me . - Yes , boss ? It 's me . I found Slate . He 's with the Marine Biologist . I 'll keep an eye on them . - I 'm not crazy , that 's a big ass egg , right ? - You 're not crazy . But it 's time we should look inside . ( beeping ) - God , what are we lookin ' at ? - No , it couldn 't be . This has all the traits of being some kind of dinosaur ! An ancestor maybe ? I don 't know . - You mean , like the extinct kind ? - Well , not entirely . I mean , technically crocodiles are dinosaurs . Birds too . - So you 're sayin ' there 's more of these out there ? - It would seem so . - And how big do you think it might be ? - I mean , based on the size of the footprints and the fact that it tore apart two dive boats like it was nothing , I 'd say at least 40 to 50 feet tall . But to learn more , we 're gonna have to crack her open . - Okay . You need some help with that ? - Just don 't break anything . - Hey , you got any beer ? - Right in the fridge over there . - Here you go . - Thanks . - It 's your beer . - I mean , from before . We would have died down there had it not been for you . - You wouldn 't have been out there unless it was for me . - Well , that 's true . Now I want you to make yourself useful . Put this on . - Do you really think all this is necessary ? - And these gloves . You 've seen " Alien " , right ? Can never be too careful . - Okay , what do you want me to do ? - That 'd be great . Now I want you to hold it just like this . Nice and straight . Very , very , very gentle . Nice and steady . I 'm just gonna chip the top . - Oh , God , that 's awful . what is that ? - It 's hydrogen sulfide and methane . A bit pungent , but nothing you can 't handle . ( hisses ) Careful . Not too close . - Come on , it 's eyes are closed . I 'm just gonna- - Whoa ! Whoa ! - Oh ! Oh ! - Bring me the- - - ( growling ) - The what ? - Right behind you . It 's a sedative . Right behind you . - Which one ? - It 's the one with the green top . - Okay ? - Give me three cc 's . - How much is that ? - Just fill it up . Hurry , hurry ! Come on , Jacks ! - Okay , okay ! - Okay , set it down . - Okay . - Grab the forceps . One , two , three . - Oh ! - Where is it ? Where 'd it go ? - I don 't know . - Do you see it ? - Jacks , look in the corner by the file cabinet ! - Where ? Where ? - Oh , my God . Just be careful . - I got it . - Careful . - I got it . - Careful ! - I got it . - Oh , my God . I 'll get it . Open the freezer , Jacks . Open the freezer ! - Okay . ( panting ) - Oh , my God , that was close . - See , babe ? I 'm an honest soul . - Yeah , right . Could be worse , though . - Couldn 't get much better , though , could it ? It 's not that bad , is it ? - What are you doing ? - What , babe ? I thought you came here to party . - I did . I just need another Mimosa . - All right , babe . I 'll be right back . - Thanks . ( reggae music playing ) - Here you go . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . - Hey , can we stop for a second ? - What ? What 's wrong ? Hey , if you wanna go downstairs to be more private , we can . - Look , dude , it 's just not gonna happen , okay ? I have a boyfriend . I think this party 's over . - Party 's gotta end sometime , doesn 't it ? ( screams ) - Help ! Help ! - Oh , great . - ( screams ) - I guess I 'll go . - Forget it , man . ( screams ) ( shouting , screaming ) ( shouting ) - Hey , what 's goin ' on ? Hey , did you see what happened ? Hey , hey , excuse me . Hey , can I see these ? Thank you , thank you . What the- - ? - It 's coming ! - Go , go , go ! ( screams ) - Here . Henry ! Man , I need you to get me out there ! - Sure . Yo , unchock the boat real quick ! - See the wreckage out there ? The boat ? Get us out there wide open . Let 's go ! Hey , when we get out there , man , you keep your eyes peeled . - Look at that . - Predator X ? - 50 feet long and 100,000 pounds . Four times more powerful than the Tyrannosaurus Rex . But this one had flippers . It 's not our guy . - Yeah , our guy didn 't have flippers . ( shouting ) ( screams ) - Hey , take it easy ! Take it easy ! - I blow this bitch head off . - Slow down ! - I said don 't move . - I never knew you had the brains for science , Slate . ( panting ) - Where is my gold ? ( gasps ) - It 's not what you think , Tariq . - What I think ? What I think is you got greedy , diveman . You saw that gold and you thought you could just cut me out of this deal . Again ! - It 's not like that , okay ? A lot of weird stuff 's been going on . A lot of people have been dying lately . - You 're right about that . Tell me where the gold is . and I might let your woman live for a while . ( shrieks ) - It 's in the fridge . - Check it ! Careful . It might be a trick . ( growls ) ( screams ) ( gunfire ) ( shouting , growling ) - Kill it ! Shoot it ! Kill it ! Damn you , Slate ! You 'll never make it off this island alive ! ( growls ) ( screams ) - Go , go . - Go ! - Do you see her ? Do you see her ? Jane ! Jane , Jane ? Oh , my God ! You 'll be all right , Jane . Jane ? Goddamn it ! - Sorry , man , she 's gone . She 's gone . - I 'm sorry about your girlfriend . We should be safe enough here at the docks . But we 're dealing with something pretty lethal out there . - I saw that thing 's arms and head sticking out of the water . It 's a goddamned monster . So what do we do now ? - I don 't know . Those little ones are like gremlins from hell , though . - And they won 't stay little for long . You 're right . We should have destroyed those eggs while we had the chance . - How many of those eggs were down there ? - Two dozen . - Oh , my God . If just one of those things can do that to a sailboat , can you imagine what two dozen are gonna do ? - Yeah , or how long before they become 200 or 200,000 ? - We gotta do something right here right now . Or else we 're gonna be dealing with- - - A new apex predator , the top of the food chain . And the end of our time as a species . - We gotta destroy those eggs . All right , guys . We 're headed back out to the hole . Let 's go ! - Hey , guys , get ready . Let 's go ! - So how come we never seen this thing before ? - I think we have . Nautical tales of sea monsters are as old as humanity itself . Who khows what 's out there ? I mean , for all we know , a Poseidon Rex could have been hibernating forthe past 400 years or even the last 400,000 . Maybe nobody ever saw it and lived . Like the crew of the Cortez . - Wait . What did you call it ? - Poseidon Rex , the ' King of the Ocean ' . Just like the T-Rex was king of the land . P-Rex ruled the sea , only bigger and stronger . - So you get to name it ? - Perk of the job . - King of the sea , huh ? We 'll see about that . - Make no mistake . P-Rex may have been one of the most fearsome creatures to ever walk the earth . Or swim the earth anyway . - Okay . So how do we kill this thing ? - Well , even P-Rex is just an animal . It bleeds like anything else . - So we get guns , right ? - Uh , I 'm picking up something . Jacks . - It 's probably just the reef . It means we 're getting close . - There 's something coming up beneath us ! Something really , really big ! - Look alive on those guns ! - It 's coming in fast ! It 's almost here . - Where is it now ? - It 's underneath us ! - Full reverse ! - Hold on ! ( growls ) - Open fire ! - ( gunfire ) - My God . - Fire at its head ! ( gunfire ) - Amazing . - I 'm out ! - Reload ! - I 'm not seeing anything . - Well , I think we got him . - I think we just pissed it off . - There 's no way it survived all that . - I 've got something . I think it 's back ! Oh , my God , Henry ! Henry ! Henry ! - Spare me ! No ! - No ! ( growls ) - Jesus . - Take us over there ! ( roars ) - Guys , that 's not gonna kill it ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! I hit it ! - Great job , Jacks ! - Well done ! Good job ! - Yeah , man ! - Whoa ! - Jacks , we 're being dragged ! Pull the lever ! - Jacks , get on it ! - It 's gonna pull us under ! Pull the lever ! Hold on ! ( shrieks ) Oh , God ! Oh ! - Let 's get back to the dock ! - Oh , that was close . - Let 's get off the water , huh ? - This place looks like a ghost town . - Yeah . That tends to happen when people see a prehistoric monster come out of the water . - They got to get the hell off the island . - So you 're gonna call in the cavalry , right ? - We 'll bring enough fire power to send it back to the ice age . - Cretaceous period , actually . It , uh- - ( sighs ) Never mind . It doesn 't matter . Just don 't forget those eggs are still out there . - We 'll nuke the goddamn hole if we have to . - What about us ? - I suggest you people hide . - Just be careful . - I think he knows better than to come after us again . Okay , guys , let 's go . ( roars , screaming ) ( shouts ) - Guys , let 's get the hell outta here . - Don 't worry , guys . This is the one place we 're safe . I mean , P-rex rules the water , not the land . - You sure about that ? - On second thought , maybe we 'd better run . Definitely run . - Run ! Come on , let 's go ! Move , move , move ! Everybody run ! Get out ! - Hey , here ! - Come on , go , go , go . ( roars ) - This is unbelievable . - Oh , my God ! Upload the footage . People need to know what 's happening here . Someone must have signaled for help . It should be coming , right ? - I don 't know . I kinda think we 're on our own . We need to get outta here before that thing comes back . - And go where ? - At Henry 's boat . It 's just on the dock . - It 's 40 miles to the mainland . You wanna take that chance ? - Guys , there 's an old military base on the other side of the island past the town . We could hide there . - All right . I 'll try and distract it . You guys make your way to the car , okay ? - Good luck . - Hey ! Hey , over here ! Hey , ugly ! Come and get me ! Come on , you old reptile ! ( roars ) Go ! Go , go , go ! - Okay , come on , come on ! - No keys ! - What ? - Look for keys . - Check the body ! - Keys , keys . Got ' em , got ' em ! - Got ' em ? Let 's go , let 's go ! - No . We 're not leaving without Jacks ! No . He 'll be back any minute ! Jacks ? Jacks ? Jacks , let 's go ! - Slate ! - Tariq ? You 're , uh ... - Alive ? No thanks to you , Slate . Where is my gold ? - We 're goin ' to get it right now . - Yeah ? Now I get my gold and my revenge . But before I do , I want to kill you ! ( crunching ) - Get in , let 's go , let 's go ! Come on , drive ! That was close . Nice driving for a marine biologist . - We just follow this road for a couple more miles . - Yeah . I just wanna make one more stop . - Where ? - Guess we 'll find out . - What is this place ? - Compound of Tariq 's . - You mean the guy that just tried to kill us ? - Yep . - So why would you take us here ? - Oh , shit . - That 's why . - Man , now that 's more like it . - I don 't think we 've seen the last of that thing . I don 't know about you , but I 'm not much for hiding . I say we ought to kill that thing or die trying . - Oh , we 're gonna kill it . ( roars ) - We got company ! - Shoot it ! - Oh , my God , get it ! ( gunfire ) ( screams ) ( tires squeal ) - Everybody out ! Let 's go ! - Run ! We can lose him in the woods ! ( gunfire ) ( growling ) - Go , go , go , go ! Go , go ! - Jacks ! What the hell are you doing ? - Do what I ask and go ! - Let 's go ! We gotta move ! - Careful ! - We 're not gonna outrun it ! It 's too fast , too big ! Just keep going ! In here ! In here ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! - Come on ! - It 's coming . - Quiet . - Don 't move a muscle . ( growling ) - It 's gone . - How much farther do you think that base is ? - Not more than a mile or so . - Come on . Let 's keep moving . Let 's go . ( growls ) - How old is this place ? - I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . Hopefully , we can get a signal out from inside and call for help . - At the very least , a place to hide . - This place should be running on its own grid . - Oh , this place gives me the creeps . - Well , safer in here than out there , right ? - I guess . - So what are we looking for ? - Power . Jackpot . - You think you 'll get it up and running ? - We 'll see . - I 'll be back . I 'm gonna go check things out . - Where 'd you run off to ? - Found the armory . - Did you find anything ? - Oh , yeah . Grenades , rocket launchers , you name it . ( gasps ) - You did it ! - I 'm not sure how long it 'll last . Let 's see if we can find a radio . - Great . - Okay . - This thing looks ancient . - It is . This is Jackson Slate on the Ambergris Key . We are alone and we 're in trouble . Anyone out there , please respond . Over . Anyone out there read me ? Over . Anyone out there ? Over . This is Jacks Slate of Ambergris Key . We are alone and in trouble . Anyone out there copy this , get back . Over . I gotta assume we 're still alone . Found a two-seater airplane in the hangar next door . If no help comes in the morning , I 'll fly that thing outta here . - What if it comes back before then ? - Well , then we 'll give it hell . Get some rest . I 'll keep watch . - Sure you wanna stay out here all by yourself ? ( chuckles ) ( giggles ) - Let me know as soon- - Got it ? I don 't care what it takes . What 's goin ' on , Private ? - Sir , something 's strange . I received a transmission on an old military band , one that hasn 't been used in over 30 years . - That is strange . - Actually , that 's not even the strange part . - Where did it originate from ? - Ambergris Key , the old military base over there . - That outpost has been abandoned for decades . What did it say ? - Actually , sir , you won 't believe this . - What the- - ? - So how does one get in the business of treasure hunting ? - I think getting in is easy . It 's the getting out part that 's hard . - Oh , I 've noticed . ( chuckles ) - And how did you end up mixed up with a guy like Tariq anyway ? - Tariq ? I don 't think you can say what I do is exactly legal . So sometimes you need somebody that knows the ins and outs of a country , right ? - And I take it you probably won 't be turning any of that gold into the local government or museum ? - Would you ? - Hmm . - So what about you ? If you 're not motivated by money , I mean , you 're obviously not motivated by danger . - Hey , there 's plenty of danger in what I do . ( chuckles ) Jellyfish sting , you know . - A jellyfish , huh ? - Mm-hmm . Well , the Immortal Jellyfish , to be exact . They live in the Blue Hole . I 've been studying them for the past three years . Do you have any idea what you 've done , by the way ? By setting off those explosives , you 've done irreparable damage to their habitat . - Hey , slow down , okay ? I think finding a ship that 's been missing for over 400 years is a little more important than some jellyfish . - Oh , these jellyfish live forever . - Forever ? - As in immortal . They never die . They may hold the key to unlocking the secret of human immortality . Oh , I was just scratching the surface of all the secrets the Blue Hole may have been hiding . - So you don 't think that thing , that Poseidon Rex , is immortal as well , do you ? - I don 't really know at this point . ( radio static ) - What are you doing ? - This place is so old . I figured they 'd have this stuff laying around . And I was right . - What is it ? - A telegraph . - Morse Code ? Who you trying to reach ? - There . - The jungle ? - No . It 's a U.S. Army base . - How do you know it 's there ? - Trust me . It 's there . - So now what ? - Now we wait . - Okay . Well , what 'd you tell ' em ? - I told them that a 50-foot sea monster was attacking the island , killing everybody and that they needed to do something about it . - Yeah , I 'm sure they 're gonna take that seriously , huh ? - Well , it was worth a shot . ( static ) - Wait a minute . What 's that sound ? - ( beeping ) - Shh ! You 're not gonna like it . They got your message last night . They have satellite imaging of the creature and are tracking it now . We have to be off the island in 20 minutes . - Why ? What happens in 20 minutes ? - It 's gonna be an all-out aerial assault . They 're gonna level the whole thing . - What are you talking about ? There 's still people here ! - What are we gonna do ? - The airplane . - But it only fits two people . - Yeah , well , only one of us is going up . You guys get down to the pier . I 'll try and distract it . - One , two , three , four . - You still have eyes on the creature ? - Yes , sir . It 's still rampaging the entire island . - Bring it up on the monitors , please . Zoom . Closer . My God ! - Sir , you won 't believe this . I just received a message from the civilians at the base . The ones from last night . Morse Code . They 're still alive . - I hope you told them they got less than 20 minutes to get out of that area before I glass the whole damn thing . - Sir , we have to give them time to escape . - I can 't let that thing get off the island . Let 's hope your friends can . Proceed . - Come on , give me a hand ! Slide it open . That 's it . ( panting ) - Come on , come on , come on . - It needs fuel ! Grab the stepladder over there ! Try on top . Right on top , right up here , right up here ! Okay ! All right , give me some slack ! All right . Once he gets it in , just pump , okay ? - Okay , ready ? Ready ? - Go , go . Come on ! Come on ! We need more ! - I 'm pumping as hard and fast as I can ! ( growls ) - Guys ? Guys ? It 's back ! That 's it ! - All right , get out of here ! Get out of here ! - Be careful , Jacks . - Get off this island ! ( growls ) - Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go , let 's go , get the bow line ! ( roars ) - Come on , you bastard , follow me . - Come on , come on , come on ! ( growls ) - T minus five minutes to destination . - Copy that , Gold Leader . You are weapons free if you can make visual contact with the target . - Go ! Light it up , light it up ! ( gunfire ) - Keep shooting ! Keep shooting ! - The son of a bitch won 't die ! - Pilot , please identify yourself . - Hey , it 's Jackson Slate . Who 's this ? - You are ordered to leave this airspace at once . - Now listen here ! I 'm the one that called the S.O.S. The goddamned monster 's been attacking the island ! - Come here ! Take the wheel ! - Get it , Rod ! Get it ! Be careful , Rod ! ( roars ) - Whoa ! - You are ordered to immediately leave the area before aerial bombardment commences . - There 's still people on the island ! The creature 's not on land anymore . It 's in the water . - Lieutenant , have ' em paint the target . - We 're tracking your position . If you continue to paint the target , we can get a lock . Do you understand , Mr. Slate ? - I do . - Gold Leader , the Cessna 22 will paint the target . Lock onto his transponder signal . - Affirmative . ( roars ) - Oh ! ( screams ) - No ! ( screams ) - Raptor 's are nearly in visual range , sir . T minus 30 seconds . ( growls ) - Direct hit ! The creature is down ! - Yes ! - I repeat , the creature is down . - I want a cleanup team in there immediately . Good job , good job . - What about Slate ? ( growls ) - Sir , it 's back ! - No ! No , it 's impossible ! - Look ! - Yeah . ( screams ) - Woo ! - Yes ! Yes ! ( pants ) - Hey , there . - You 're alive . Jacks . - How would you like a vacation ? - How about a different island ? - Sounds good to me . - Aren 't we forgetting something ? - The gold ? - No . I mean the eggs . ( rustling ) ( growls )

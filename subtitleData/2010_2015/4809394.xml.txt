 In the dreams you were having did you feel like you knew me ? - You 're a stranger . What would I feel ? I 'm in the wrong place . The people I know and love are somewhere else . I gotta figure out how to get home . I can make it more comfortable while you 're here . - Deja vu . - I wanted to check in with you . It can be kind of overwhelming . - I 'm not freaked out . - Good . So , what were these trials all about anyway ? Walter and William Bell thought that children had extrasensory capabilities . And so they experimented on kids . Some of the children didn 't handle the Cortexiphans well . Some had adverse reactions . Emotionally , you were always the strongest . Uh , I called in a prescription just a little while ago . - Olivia Dunham ? - Yes . Ahem . This is your last refill . So have your doctor call in a new prescription for next time . Yeah . I was hoping I wouldn 't need these anymore . Thanks . - Have a good night . - Yeah . When there 's thunder and lightning , people That 's a bad sign it 's gonna rain When there 's thunder and lightning , people That 's a bad , bad sign it 's gonna rain Hey . Hey . This is bizarre . Well , I just , uh ... I was on my way home . And I only live a few blocks from here . I didn 't know that . So you 're just heading home now ? From a walk . I had a migraine and , you know , fresh air helps . You ? Well , as far as 24-hour dining goes , this place is better than most . Hey , this place makes a pretty good cup of coffee . If you wanna join . You haven 't slept in how long ? Since I got here . That 's a long time . - It 's hard adjusting to a new city and ... - Yeah , I can imagine . I look to you to see the truth A couple of weeks ago , you asked me if I was ... Freaked out ? I used to believe , just a few months ago , that I understood the world we lived in . I mean , there were basic truths that I thought were well , true . I used to sleep like a baby . Blissful ignorance . You know , eventually , it will just become your life . Is that what happened with you ? Yeah . Uh , sort of . Hey . Hi , babe . You close ? Yeah , sorry . I 'm almost there . I took the shortcut behind the theater . All right . You okay ? Uh , no . I feel like I 'm being followed . - What ? By who ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . I 'm sure it 's just my imagination . Where are you ? I 'm calling the police . No , Meg , it 's fine . I 'm two blocks away from Willow . Hello ? - Meg . - Cops are on their way . No , it 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm here . I 'm home ... This is Grant . I need an ambulance at 1625 Willow . Ten-four . Copy location . God , what happened to this guy ? Is he alive ? - What the hell was that ? - What ? - What are you shooting at ? - I don 't know . - Jack ? - Freeze . Ma 'am . Ma 'am , stay back . - No . Jack . - Ma 'am . - He 's my husband . Stop . - Stay back . Jack ! You gotta love this assignment , right ? Where else can you find baked goods , car parts , and video games ... - ... all under the same roof ? - Yes , sir . Sir ? I 'm moving up in the world . Did Broyles tell you to call me that ? Keep that level of formality , that way you don 't get attached to your prisoner ? You 're not my prisoner . So , what , then ? You 're my bodyguard ? Maybe just imagine I 'm a friend . Yeah , every 32-year-old man needs a friend to chaperone him while he 's underwear shopping . You know what ? That reminds me . Agent Broyles told me to tell you he 's authorized you a $ 200-a-week allowance . Two hundred . Big spender . The only other thing I need is safety glasses . You see them ? No . Here we go . Ha , ha . Here , let me give you a hand . I 'll get it . Thanks . - What was that about ? - Nothing . Just figured I 'd help . You really think I 'd hurt a kid ? I 've been instructed to limit your interaction with civilians . It 's not personal . I 've been investigating Fringe events for three years . I never thought I 'd become one . Like I said , it 's not personal . Victim 's name is Jack Zoephel . At approximately 3 : 30 a.m. , his wife placed a call to 911 . He believed he was being followed home . His wife was on the phone with Jack when he was attacked . The police arrived less than two minutes after the call was placed . When they got here , he was already dead . I 'm assuming he didn 't look like this before he left ? - No . - Walter 's gonna love this . What 's with all the broken glass ? That uniformed officer believed he was shooting the perpetrator . So he can identify the guy ? Not exactly . So you shot at nothing ? I was just spooked , is all . You unloaded your entire clip . I don 't know what to tell you . I overreacted . I bet you don 't want to tell us what happened because you 're concerned about your reputation . You don 't need to be . Whatever you saw , however bizarre it is , we need to know what it was . I don 't know how I 'm gonna file a report for this case . We 'll take care of that if you just tell us what you saw . I didn 't see anything , exactly . But I felt something . Like what ? - A ghost ? - You said " ghost , " not me . His neck is broken . Could 've happened post-mortem . Cause of death could be due to rapid onset of adrenaline . Walter , I can 't understand you . Are you eating ? Onion rings from Sully 's , double-dipped in beer batter . Fantastic . He could have died from a rapid spike of adrenaline associated with fear . That could be why he 's white as a sheet . What , are you saying that he was scared to death ? Walter , that 's just an old wives ' tale . Where 's your imagination ? Must have been a very boring child . I 'm ignoring that . Huh . Did Walter have any theories ? Uh , a few . Until he runs some tests , he 's not gonna know anything for sure . Can I ask you something ? All the things that we see like this . Does it ever get to you ? Yes . Every day . If I wasn 't seeing the agency 's shrink my head would 've exploded a long time ago . It 's not like I can talk to family or friends . I mean ... Well , who do you talk to ? No one . I 'm starting to think that that 's weird . That 's just not normal , is it ? We can rule out ghosts . What makes you say that ? Ghosts don 't bleed . Hi , how 's the morning treating you ? Pretty good , and yourself ? Not too bad . Glad the hot weather 's starting to turn . Me too . Fall 's my favorite . I love how the leaves change colors . After you . So you have big plans for the weekend ? There have been three bodies similar to this one found in the surrounding area over the past two weeks . Why is this the first we 're hearing of it ? Before they ran the medical records the police just assumed that all the victims were suffering from albinism . It 's more common than people think . I guess . Any luck ? Well , so far I 've checked law-enforcement databases , including Interpol . But it 's possible this person 's DNA is not in any criminal database . What about hospitals ? That 's my next move . We call them albinos , but the Kiswahili tribe from Tanzania call them zeru . It 's also the word for ghosts . Witch doctors from there sometimes use body parts from albinos in potions for good luck or fortune . - That 's ... - Grisly . Yeah , I 'd say that . You found something ? Yeah . There 's a mucus-like substance on the body a residue . - From something in particular ? Aha . They 're chromatophore cells . You find them in octopi , chameleons . Cells that have the ability to translocate pigment in the body . It 's what certain creatures use to blend into their backgrounds . I just got a positive ID on the blood sample . - Do we have a name ? - Uh-huh . Baby Boy Bryant . According to this , the blood sample we found at the scene belonged to a baby born on July 26th , 1989 , at Parkview Hospital in New York . And he died four days later , July 30th , 1989 . Well , that 's quite a quandary . Perhaps we 're looking for a ghost after all . They started automating their records 20 years ago . Here it is . " Baby Boy Bryant . Born 26 July , 1989 . " They didn 't even give him a proper name . " Infant born with an unclassified genetic variant . " Over 10 specialists examined him , and no one could diagnose him . " No medical precedent found . " - You okay ? - Yeah . I just started to get another migraine . - I can do it . - I know you can , but you don 't need to . - Thanks . - I 'll get you some water . This baby was a mystery . Says he died from complications of his genetic abnormality on the 30th of July , 1989 . Which we already knew . Thank you . Okay . " Dr. Blake West and Teresa Jaffee , RN . " See , I wonder if either of them are still working here . Miss Jaffee , is this your signature on the death certificate ? Yes . Can you tell us what you remember about Baby Boy Bryant ? I was in the delivery room when he was born . He was so pale . When Dr. West held him up , the lights in the OR burned his skin . We had to put him in a special ward with no windows and no lights . So when Dr. West told me that the baby had died I was relieved that he wasn 't suffering anymore . What is it ? I 've never told anyone this . As they carried him out I thought I heard him cry . It was faint , but I thought I heard him . I assumed I had imagined it . Do you remember where he was taken to ? It was a private insurance company . Um ... Something like " Cilas " or " Cypro . " Cyprox ? Yes . That 's it . Cyprox Incorporated . I was told they 'd be handling the autopsy . Thank you so much for your help . Okay . How 'd you know Cyprox ? Because they paid my mother 's medical bills while she was dying of cancer . And Cyprox was a subsidiary of a larger company called Kelvin Genetics . Why do I have a bad feeling about this ? Because Kelvin Genetics became Massive Dynamic . Cyprox Inc . It 's been years since I heard that name . We have reason to believe that Cyprox Inc . Abducted an infant from a hospital 22 years ago . I 'm afraid your suspicions are true . What can you tell us about him ? The boy had an unidentified genetic abnormality . He would have died within days . But the same genetic deformity made him suitable for some genetic experimentation . Walter discovered specific animal cells on the body that we found . Chromatophores . The nature of the boy 's cellular abnormality allowed those cells to be implanted into his system making him able to blend into his surroundings . Making him a perfect spy or soldier . Well , there were military applications , yes . Unexpectedly , the experiment also allowed this child to survive . Something about the chromatophores offset his very fragile condition . And you knew about this ? No , this was a satellite research facility , one of dozens . Neither Dr. Bell nor I had any specific knowledge of what was going on . I 'm not trying to justify what was done I 'm just saying this child would 've died had he not been part of that program . Maybe that would have been better . I think I 'll send the boy 's files over to Walter 's lab . Maybe there 's something in them that can help . If you didn 't know about him how are you so familiar with all this ? There was a fire in the lab 10 years ago . And we assumed that all the subjects had died in that fire . That was the first time that William and I ever learned of U-gene . Eugene ? U-gene . Short for " Unknown Genetic Disorder . " His entire life , he didn 't have a proper name . We assumed that he had died . And as you can imagine , it was impossible to prove . So now it seems as if we were wrong . Me , oh , my I can 't believe my eyes Everything I care about is gone I wonder why Life is tough No matter how I try Tell me that I 'm dreamin Ziggy ? Tell me it 's a lie Me , oh , my Ziggy ? Come here , kitty , kitty . Can 't you hear my beating heart In and out of time ? Ziggy . Me , oh , my Where are you ? Me , oh , my - Hey . - Hey . Come in . Sorry it took Broyles so long to sign off on this stuff . I was starting to get worried . After all your help the other day , I 'm surprised he didn 't give you a badge . - Thank you . - It 's my job . No , no , I mean thank you for treating me like a human being . I haven 't been getting that a lot lately . I appreciate it . You really think it 'll get you back ? The machine was powerful enough to snap me out . It stands to reason that it 's powerful enough to snap me in . - I suppose that makes sense . - I hope so . - My best chance at getting back home . - Altered universes , different timelines . Olivia says that eventually all of this will seem run-of-the-mill . Which , frankly , I 'm having a hard time believing . It 's insane how none of this fazes her . She 's made quite an impression on you , huh ? I 've never met anyone like her before . Yeah , I know what you mean . You were together , weren 't you ? You and Olivia . Uh ... Back where you came from . Yeah , we are . - God , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to ... - No , no , no . It 's okay . The Olivia you 're talking about , that 's not my Olivia . This is Agent Lee . I 'll be right there . I need to go . Walter has something to show us . No problem . I 'll see you later . Oh , good , you 're here . I want to show you something . - Is that an octopus ? - Charming , isn 't she ? Brilliant , creative creatures . You know , they actually do build gardens . Colored rocks and plants and shells and even garbage . They arrange them around their caves . - And they 're like chameleons . - Hey , Walter . Why did we just get a bill for $ 818 ? You know I 'm gonna be the one to take the blame for this . Tell Agent Broyles that science has no price tag . I 'm sure he 'll be very pleased to hear that . Uh , Nina sent over some files for you . - Thank you . - Oh . U-gene . Fascinating story . Walter , do you think that U-gene is trying to make himself visible ? That he is killing people in order to steal their pigment ? - Is that even possible ? - It 's possible , of course . Leprechauns are possible . That would explain the mucus on the victim 's body . I didn 't understand what it was but it must be acting as some kind of conductor . And that 's how U-gene 's chromatophores are absorbing the victim 's pigment . But to overcome what 's been done to him would require a considerable amount of pigment . - Walter , you 're saying that if I 'm right ... - Yes . I 'm afraid you 'll be finding a lot more victims . Everyone , come quickly . I have two pieces of news . - First , he 's dying . - Who 's dying , Walter ? Our suspect . The chameleon man . I 've spent the last few hours re-creating what we believe our young man is doing to himself . Assuming you 're right , Olivia , and he is trying to repigmentize himself , then ... Is that a word ? Repigmentize ? Go on , Walter . What is he trying to do to himself ? The condition he was born with was killing him . And if he 's now attempting to reverse what was done to him ... To make himself normal . Or what was normal to him . - Then he is , in effect , committing suicide . So you 're saying he 's poisoning himself . In a sense , yes . His body is reverting to the deadly condition that he came into the world with . Although he may not be aware of it . - Well , how long until he dies ? - Oh , don 't worry . - John here will be fine . - Uh , I don 't think Olivia meant the mouse . The human ? Well , I can 't say . I suppose it depends on how successful he is . Okay , well , that doesn 't change things . We still have to find him . How do we find something we can 't see ? That was the second thing I had to tell you . Ultraviolet light . Come on , Yoko , where are you ? She 's been there the whole time ? That was Broyles . They found another body . I was starting my shift when I saw the body . I didn 't know what it was at first , all pale and white . It took me a while to see it was Mr. Ryerson . - Are the cameras functional ? - Yeah , just installed a few weeks ago . There have been some break-ins recently . You 're saying that nobody left the building ? There 's an emergency alarm on the back door , and you were at the front door ? - You never walked away ? - No , and I watched the security footage just to make certain . This is going to sound odd . Even though you didn 't see anyone did any of the exterior doors open on their own ? Heh . What are you looking for ? Lieutenant Broyles , the dogs got a scent . - Where does that lead ? - The upper levels . - Are there any exits on those floors ? - No . - Sir , he could still be out there . - Lock this place down . I need every available unit to the Elmwood Apartments . Lieutenant Broyles , the last floor is evacuating . - They were instructed to leave doors open ? - Mm-hm . Okay , shut it down . Everything but the elevators . - Shut down as planned , over . - Ten-four . - My men are ready . - Okay . Take your team down and clear the parking garage and the basement . I 'm gonna take one team to the highest floor , work our way down . - You start here , we 'll meet in the middle . - Okay . You guys come with me . We 'll take the north stairwell . This is taking too long . Let 's split up . Go . I 'll take this floor . We 've got a scent . This is Team 3 . False lead . It 's just a shirt . Olivia , can you read me ? Olivia , come in . Help me , please . You understand right now how important it is to be seen . Your life depends on it . Me seeing you right now . Okay , just wait . Listen , you 're dying . Whatever it is that you 're doing to yourself , it 's killing you . Just please let us try and heal you . I don 't think you 're here to help me heal . Not after what I 've done . If you are here to help me , it 's because I have value to the military and they don 't want long-lost experiment 69545 to self-destruct . Not when they 've found him again . We have nothing to do with the military . I am just here to stop the killing . All my life I 've been watching them live theirs . Watching them fall in love . To be looked upon by the right person . To connect . And to see in their eyes kindness . Happiness . And recognition . That 's when you exist . Liv , please respond . Are you okay ? There is a scientist who I work with for the FBI . He works out of a Harvard lab . Now , if anyone can hope to undo what they have done ... I lived my life in a lab . I am not going back . If you treat yourself again , even once , it could kill you . Olivia , where are you ? Olivia . She 's in here . He 's got my gun . Spencer , come in . Agent Broyles . We 've got nothing . The dogs have been through every floor twice . He 's gone . We 'll let you know , folks . Please . Let 's get these people into their homes . Let them in . - Sir . - Go ahead . You 're gonna want to see this . There 's a sub-basement where all the pipes run . It 's designed as a service bay . This is his home . These items must belong to all the residents . Like he kept a small token from each person 's life . He was watching them . Looks like you were right . He was trying to cure himself . This isn 't about curing himself . This is about being seen . I thought you weren 't coming today . I see you every day . I thought you might have caught the cold that 's been going around . No . Well , that 's good , then . It 's too beautiful a day to be sick . The most beautiful . My name is Eugene . I 'm Julie . I thought you should know that we found U-gene Bryant 's body . It 's over . Well , thank you . But you could have called to tell me that . All he wanted was to be like everyone else . But how could he ? He 'd never be like anyone else . Not after what they did to him . So you 're thinking about what was done to you ? You know , even with my colleagues , I 'm different . Things that should bother me ... Do you think that it 's possible the Cortexiphan trials stunted my emotions ? Oh , Olive , you can 't let what happened to you as a child define you . And , no , the answer to your question You are perfectly normal . At least as normal as any of us is normal . Life is an experiment . You have to find out where you belong . Find your own place in this world . But shouldn 't I know where that is by now ? Not necessarily . I mean , before you and your sister came to live with me , my life was work . And I didn 't think that I could find the time or the room for you girls in my life . Now I can 't imagine what my life would have been like if I hadn 't taken that risk . Oh , when the time is right , you 'll know . Hey . Hey . - What 's this ? - I got you something . Just trust me . I 'm gonna get going . Broyles is letting me use the lab . - Hey . - Hey . - Is that our paperwork ? - Yep . - Just finished . - Thank you . We can put this case on the list of things that makes it hard for you to sleep . That list is getting longer . Well , maybe if you find yourself , uh , at the diner tonight say , around 3 a.m. , I might ... I might see you there . I 'll see you then . Maybe . Yeah , yeah . Clear . - Should we move her to the bed ? - No need . She 's not gonna remember the last two hours anyway . When she wakes up , she 's gonna have one hell of a headache .

 Previously on " marvel 's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Skye : And an 0-8-4 is ... ? An object of unknown origin . The girl was the 0-8-4 ? And who do you work for , raina ? The clairvoyant ? The clairvoyant gives us guidance . He has you building super soldiers . Skye : Mike - - he 's a good guy . Mike ! No . Ian quinn . You got to be kidding . This is quinn 's m.O. He finds young talent and he takes advantage . Coulson : We 're on to you . Quinn : Well , thank you , agent coulson . And I have a message for you . The clairvoyant told me to say hello . [ beep ] Ian quinn . You found him ? No , but we think we know how we can . [ horn blares ] Skye tracked down an invoice from one of his shell companies . He made a big purchase recently . $ 10 million big . Any idea what it is ? No clue , but it was designed and built by cybertek , inc . , A small firm that deals In advanced technology and research . Which is where this gets interesting . They 've hired a private-security outfit To transport the purchase - - former military , ex-mercs . Lot of muscle to move one package . And they know s.H.I.E.L.D. ' s got eyes on quinn . Which is why they 're transporting it old-school . On a train , through the italian countryside , From verona to zagreb - - very rural , very isolated . And you think quinn 's on that train . No , but I believe they 're delivering the item To quinn himself . We got our intel from italian authorities Who have been monitoring the situation . And they don 't mind us taking over the op ? I asked very nicely . You 're not asking me at all , agent coulson . You 're telling me and my team to step aside To hand over our investigation to s.H.I.E.L.D. Try to think of it less as a hand-over And more as a hand-off . You 've done your part . Now we 'll do ours . If everything goes as planned , Cybertek 's security team won 't even know we were on the train . So we 're going in undercover . I hate undercover . Coulson : May and ward , you 're front and center . Once we locate the package , you 'll tag it with a tracker . Skye and fitz , you 'll be running communications . After the package is tagged , we 'll follow it to quinn . Once we capture quinn , We 'll be one step closer to the clairvoyant . And what about the two of us , sir ? Here . Let me get that . Oh . Thanks , dad . Who looks far too young to have a daughter my age . [ horn blares ] [ man coughs ] That looks cozy . Once I 've located the package , I 'll let you know where to place the tracker . Seem like things are getting personal ? I 'm talking about our operations . Look , I know coulson was put through hell , but ... He hasn 't been the same since . I don 't know what he said to skye , but she 's different . How so ? Driven , focused . And she was holed up for days trying to track down quinn . It feels like coulson 's got her on a warpath . Seems personal . It is personal . The clairvoyant had him tortured . Quinn 's the only person we know who 's connected to all this . Ward : We both know personal urges Can adversely affect tactical decisions . Hmm . That 's why I don 't have any . You should do the same . Ward : Really ? Coulson will take that excuse if he finds out about us ? Took it okay when I told him . Wait . You told him ? Yep . Are you nervous ? Just ready for this all to be over . I 'm ready to get quinn . Me , too . So , are we british or american ? Does that matter ? Well , we 're traveling together . We should at least be from the same country . How 's your scottish accent ? [ bad scottish accent ] I don 't know . You tell me how great it is , laddie . [ american accent ] american , then . That 's a better idea . [ normal voice ] oh . That was really good . [ normal voice ] I used to watch a lot of american tv growing up . Some of it 's quite good . Lots of nice teeth . Oh . Here we go . Follow my lead . Excuse me . Do you speak english ? Of course . How may I be of service ? Can you recommend a restaurant in downtown zagreb ? [ american accent ] someplace affordable , with big portions . You are looking for something romantic ? Yes . Please . [ giggles ] We are celebrating our six-month anniversary With a whirlwind trip all over europe . Ah . Well , technically , we met six months ago , But he didn 't ask me out till last month , So our official one-month anniversary Isn 't until next Saturday . Sunday - - Saturday . Yeah . I think he found me intimidating . Young love . So ... Confusing . Is it ? [ keys rattle ] You , uh , got a little flustered back there . [ normal voice ] what ? When you kissed me on the cheek like my grandmother ? Good going . Really selling our relationship there . I have a device that could have done those things - - Broken the lock and all that . What ? Why wouldn 't you tell me that ? I 'm always the gadget guy . Maybe sometimes I want to do things with my bare hands . You make the gadgets with your bare hands . Just allow me these rare moments of self-pity , okay ? You 're the least supportive pretend girlfriend I 've ever had . [ chuckles ] comms are live . Coulson , simmons , you in position ? Yes . Just waiting on may 's signal . So remember , our target is carlo - - Mancini , the head of security . I know . I memorized his face . I memorized everything . What are you doing ? Oh . I 'm getting into character . My undercover persona harbors residual resentment To her absent american father - - Blames him for not being there when her mom died . So I apologize in advance if I come off a little cold . You think all that back story 's necessary ? Past events , like that unfortunate incident at the hub , Have shown me that I 'm not good at improvisation . However , I excel at preparation . Fitz : He 's headed your way . You 're on . All mom ever wanted was your love , to be with you , At our two-story victorian home in the cotswolds . But could you even give her a moment , What with your banking job requiring you To travel to the states from Tuesday to Saturday Every other week ? ! No ! I 'm terribly sorry about your loss , dear . As for you , now is your chance to do better . Why don 't you see that you take it ? Thank you , sir . Let 's go . He 's right . You never had any time for her , But you made time for your work ! And your prostitutes ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh , god ! Oh ! Oh , no ! Mom ! [ speaking italian ] Coulson : Terribly sorry . Prostitutes ? Plural ? May , coming your way . Copy that . Following the target to the package . Skye : Great . We see what you see . All right , may , cybertek cases are usually lined With tungsten polymer to prevent scanning . It should appear black on your infrared . Bingo ! Uh , eyes on the package , fourth seat from the back . [ p.A. Tones ] [ woman speaking italian ] As we round the bend , Passengers on the north side of the train Can take in the views of the famous tre cime di lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Simmons : Look at that . I haven 't seen anything so beautiful Since our family 's scuba-diving trip To the island of koh tao in southeastern thailand . Okay , simmons , I appreciate all your preparation , but - - And you want to know which marine life we encountered ? Ward , are you in position ? [ static ] My comms are down . Are yours working ? Fitz ? Skye ? Something 's wrong . Sit tight . I 'm gonna go make sure we don 't lose that package . [ horn blares ] Ward ! We 've been made ! Grenade ! Coulson , we got to jump ! [ grunting ] [ p.A. Tones ] [ speaking italian ] As we round the bend , Passengers on the north side of the train Can take in the views of the famous tre cime di lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? May , got the tracker . Headed to the dining car now to tag the package . [ static ] may ? May ? [ grunts ] See ? Told ya . Cybertek knew we were here . Anyone copy ? Damn it . We 've been made . Comms are down . Where 's coulson ? He went to the dining car to find the package . You 've been hurt . Let me take a look . Not now . Go to the luggage car . Lock yourself in with fitz and skye . Don 't come out until I get you . I 'm gonna get coulson . Coulson : Ward ! We 've been made ! Grenade ! Coulson , we got to jump ! The train - - it just ... Yep . Vanished . Which , I might add ... Not easy . I told simmons I 'd come back for them . May 's there . They 'll be okay . No , she 's not . Is your phone working ? No . Cybertek must have taken out our electronics . Not a grenade , exactly . Might be some kind of cloaking mechanism . Maybe it created some kind of portal , Jumped the train there ? Oh , let 's hope not . I can 't deal with asgard today . Cybertek knew we were coming . How ? Could have been the clairvoyant . We got to get back to the plane . Come on . Keys might be in it . It 's the country . People are very trusting in the country . [ engine idling ] It 's running . Yeah , it 's been hot-wired . This is ... Suspicious ? I was gonna say " fortuitous . " let 's get out of here . [ beeping ] Signore russo , are you okay ? Agent coulson . Thank god . I 've been trying to reach you . Cybertek knew . They knew we were at the station . They knew we were on the train , too . Most of my team is unaccounted for . Most of my men are dead ! Where are you now ? On our plane . We 'll send you the coordinates . And , russo , do you have any idea what happened to the train ? What do you mean ? It vanished , with our team still on it . Okay . We 'll look into that . I 'm on my way to you now . And maybe together , we can find some answers , yes ? What now ? I 'll call h.Q. You take this . We need to figure out what the hell happened to that train . Holotable - - on . Holotable - - activate . [ beeping ] ah . Really ? [ sighs ] Ah . S.H.I.E.L.D. Pulled satellite images . And ? Train 's gone . They 're checking alternate routes . If it 's somewhere on earth , we 'll find it . It 's ... Pretty tricky , right ? I couldn 't even find the " on " button . Can you zoom in ? I - - I think fitz-simmons do something more like ... Damn . Let 's just upload the specs to h.Q. Good idea . Yeah . Oh . Uh , sir ? This probably isn 't the best time , But what may told you ... I would have preferred it to stay between me and her . Well , " it " is happening on my bus , Amongst members of my team . No , we 've never ... Done - - It 's never happened on the bus , sir . You want to do this now ? Okay . What you 're doing is against protocol , So if you endanger an operation or if anyone gets hurt , I 'll reassign you to barrow , alaska , And you 'll spend the rest of your years Pulling the night shift guarding blonsky 's cryo-cell . Am I clear ? I 'll take that as a yes . And if it 's really just sex , ward ... You should get more comfortable using the word . Agent coulson , it 's gonna be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's - - Wheels up in five . [ p.A. Tones ] [ woman speaking italian ] As we round the bend , Passengers on the north side of the train Can take in the views of the famous tre cime di lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Ward , you 're up . [ static ] ward ? Something 's wrong . Cybertek 's leaving the dining car . Ward , coul- - [ gunshot ] [ static ] fitz ? Skye ? Can anyone read me ? [ sighs ] I 've got to get you guys somewhere safe . [ electricity crackles ] [ engine turns over ] We 've been looking for you , agent may . [ grunts ] [ gasps , groans ] [ breathing heavily ] [ bucket clatters ] Get your bearings , sweetheart . Get your bearings . There you go . There you go . I realize you 're confused . But I 'm here to help . You see , I make sure cybertek products Move across Italy without incident . They make sure I 'm well taken care of . And they 'll take care of you , too . All you have to do is tell me Where agent coulson and ward are . That 's it . [ chuckles ] why are you smiling ? You called me " sweetheart . " Fine . Have it your way . Just remember , your boss asked to be part of this op . I warned him against it . So if you 're looking for someone to blame , look to him . [ groans ] That 's just what I needed . [ speaking italian ] [ groans ] [ gunshot ] [ tires screeching ] If it 's really just sex , ward ... You should get more comfortable using the word . Agent coulson , it 's going to be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's - - [ thud ] wheels up in five . You okay ? You were on the train when it disappeared . May , russo was - - Explain yourself , please . The train didn 't disappear . Russo sold us out . Get the plane ready . I need a shower . You 're hurt . Let me stitch you up . I said get the plane ready . [ groaning ] [ grunts ] Coulson : Let me help . You know ... We have this stuff for a reason . [ grunts ] S.H.I.E.L.D. Found the train . Turns out it switched tracks shortly after we got off . [ inhales sharply ] That grenade must have released some kind of toxin . Made us believe no time had passed . I saw you guys frozen on the field . You looked ridiculous . It wasn 't supposed to be a combat op . They 'll be fine . They can handle themselves . I got it . Gently . Okay . Thank you . Did he get you anywhere else ? [ scoffs ] We need to reroute the plane . We just got word from s.H.I.E.L.D. That the train stopped suddenly in the italian countryside . What ? Why ? We 'll find out soon . I 'll set the coordinates . Touchdown in 10 . I 'll come help . I got it . All right , grazie . Parked here 15 minutes ago . Agents on the ground have no idea why . Any sign of fitz-simmons and skye ? No . [ clatter ] Everyone get down ! Simmons , stop ! [ breathing heavily ] What ? Where are fitz and skye ? [ p.A. Tones ] [ speaking italian ] As we round the bend , Passengers on the north side of the train ... I wish we had more time to take in the scenery . ... Can take in the views of the famous tre cime di lavaredo . Three peaks of lavaredo - - supposed to be stunning . Any chance what 's in there could be an 0-8-4 ? This ? Now , we may not know what it is , But we do know that it came from cybertek . Right . Unknown origin . And the one we found in peru was a machine , But they don 't always have to be , right ? No . No , I 've read about all kinds - - Weapons , spacecraft , energy sources . I suppose the only thing they really do have in common Is that they 're dangerous . Right . Hey , whatever this package turns out to be , We 'll deal with it , like we always do . We 've faced worse and made it through . Fitz , have you ever heard of an 0-8-4 being a person ? No . Although I - - I suppose it 's possible . Hate to meet the guy . [ static ] Whoa . May 's goggles are offline . When did that happen ? May , do you copy ? All comms and phones are dead . Someone 's using some sort of electronic scrambler . Cybertek knows we 're here . We have to warn our team . Fitz , get down ! [ silenced gunshots ] We 've been made ! Oh , bloody hell . Jemma ! Oh , my god . She 's okay . [ breathing heavily ] Okay . Hold her up . There we go . I think this is some form of dendrotoxin . The same stuff that 's in the night-night gun ? Yeah . It 's clearly evolved . I think they made it airborne . Is that why their eyes are open ? I suppose if they were in some sort of black sleep , That would make sense . We got to get out of here , Find the others and figure out what to do next . Yeah , but help me move simmons first . Can 't just leave her like this . Look at her little face . She 'd be so embarrassed . We should leave her with something To protect herself , just in case . Yeah . Have a spare . What about him ? That 's for simmons . [ brakes squealing ] Train 's stopped . I know . And I looked everywhere . May , ward , and coulson are gone . What about cybertek ? [ vehicles approaching ] They have the package , fitz . What do we do ? We 're the only ones left . Do you have an extra tracker ? Of course . Then we follow them . Hey . Look . Coulson was right . Cybertek led us to quinn . Activate the tracker . Let them know we 're here . [ tracker beeping ] You want to go in . We can 't let quinn get away again . If coulson were here , he wouldn 't let that happen . He wouldn 't want us to let that happen . You 're right . Let 's do it . Can you disable their cars ? With my bare hands . Take this . You 'll need it out here . Just take it . Be careful , okay ? You , too . Okay . [ rustling ] Find mr . Quinn . Tell him his purchase is downstairs . Mike . Quinn : Hello . [ grunts ] skye . The clairvoyant told me to expect you . Mancini : Signor quinn , This is the same gun as the specs you gave us . Yeah , you guys have been looking at us While we 've been looking at you . And we found a handful of particularly interesting things . [ grunts ] [ air hisses ] Mike . Oh , god . You 're alive . That 's right . You two know each other . Hey . Do you know who I am ? And you have your orders ? Good , because I purchased something That 's gonna help you complete them . [ chuckles ] Orders ? Mike . What is happening here ? Mike . [ whirring ] Mancini : Stand , please . [ beeping ] [ gasps ] [ groaning ] [ groans , screams ] [ breathing heavily ] Mancini , thank you . You will be receiving your payment shortly . That is the best money can buy , my friend . [ clanging ] Every piece of technology in you is top-of-the-line . I just wonder if I 'm getting my money 's worth . I know you get your orders from the clairvoyant , So that means you 're not allowed to hurt me , right ? No . What if I tried to hurt you ? [ gun cocks ] Would you stop me ? No . I would not . Mike , listen . I do not know what they 're doing to you , But we have to get out of here . Now . Quinn : And ... If I wanted you to - - to hurt her ... You know , kill ... Will you ? I mean , what would hurt agent coulson more Than to lose his pet project ? Those aren 't my orders . She 's not who I 'm supposed to kill . Wait . Wait . Wait ! What the hell did you do to him ? [ gunshot ] [ gasps ] Shh , shh . [ gunshot ] I 'm sorry . I have my orders , too . [ gasping ] Help ... [ grunting ] Where 's quinn ? Where is the money ? There is no money . You failed . It looks like it 's working to me . [ speaking italian ] Apparently , there 's been a misunderstanding . We delivered the package as promised . If we can just speak to mr . Quinn - - [ gasps ] [ guns cock ] The clairvoyant isn 't happy . [ gasps ] You led s.H.I.E.L.D. Right to us . Let her go . [ choking ] [ glass shatters , body thuds ] [ gunshots ] Skye . Where 's skye ? S-s-she didn 't want to let quinn get away . [ breathing shakily ] [ groans ] Help , help ... He- - Driver 's not answering . Ah . Coulson 's team finally got here . [ grunting ] [ bones crack ] Where 's skye ? You know , agent coulson , it 's dangerous ... To keep sending her in like that , all alone ... When she means so much to you . Search the house . Find her ! Now ! [ cuffs click ] Ohh . No . Oh , no . Oh , god . Simmons ! Get down here ! Oh . Oh , god . Hang on . Just hang on , okay ? Oh , god . She 's been shot . Keep her upright . I got no pulse . Uh ... She 's lost too much blood . I don 't ... Put her in there . Do you even know what this thing is ? It 's a hyperbaric chamber , and I said put her in there now ! May : Okay . Come on ! Let 's go ! Yeah . All right . All right , gentle . Simmons : I need to get her temperature down . Fitz . [ air hissing ] [ beeping ] Fitz : Temperature 's dropping . Pressure stabilizing . Is it working ? For now . Her core temperature 's hovering around 44 degrees fahrenheit . If we don 't bring her back up to temp in the next few hours , She could sustain permanent brain damage . We need to get her to a medical facility and fast . Until then , I 'll do everything I can to keep her alive . Excuse me . [ crying ] [ sobbing ] [ grunts ] It 's not your fault . She never should have gone in there alone . Blaming yourself won 't help her . I 'm not blaming myself . [ children playing ]

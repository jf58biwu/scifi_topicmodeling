 Understand this , Eric . These Nazi 's I 'm not like them . Genes are the key , yes ? But their goals ? Blue eyes , Blonde hair , pathetic . Mmm . Eat the chocolate . It 's good . Want some ? I want to see my mama . Genes are the keys that unlocks the door to a new age , Erik . A new future for mankind . Evolution . You know what I 'm talking about ? It 's a simple thing I ask of you . A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate . Is it . Yes . I 've tried , Herr Doctor . I can 't ... I don 't ... It 's impossible . The only thing I can say for the Nazi 's . is their methods seem to produce results . I 'm sorry , Erik . Mama . My darling . How are you ? Here 's what we 're going to do . I 'm going to count to three . And you 're going to move the coin . You don 't move the coin , I pull the trigger . Understand ? One . Mama . You can do it . Two . Everything is good . Mother : Everything is good . Everything is good . Three . Yes , wonderful ! Excellent . Noooo . Outstanding , Erik . So we unlocked your gift with anger . Anger and pain . Shaw : You and me . We 're going to have a lot of fun together . Possession of that gold is illegal . I should inform the police . Let 's not play this game . Where did you get it ? A friend . He recommended your bank most highly . I see . Do you know our terms , sir ? Yes . And you should know mine . This gold is what remains of my people . Melted from their possessions . Torn from their teeth . This is blood money . And you 're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it . Don 't touch that alarm . I want Schmidt . Klaus Schmidt . Where is he ? Our clients don 't provide addresses . We 're not ... Not that sort of bank ? Metal fillings , eh ? Not gold . Worried someone might steal them ? Argentina ! Schmidt is in Argentina ! Villa Gesell ! Please ! Thank you . I would love to kill you . So mark my words . If you warn anyone I 'm coming ... I will find you . - Good evening , my friends ! - Good evening ! - Hot , no ? - Yes ... One beer , please . German beer . Of course . Yes , it 's Bitburger . You like it ? The best . What brings you to Argentina ? The climate , I 'm a pig farmer . Tailor , since I was a boy . My father made the finest suits in Düsseldorf . My parents were from Düsseldorf . - Ah . - Yeah . What was their name ? They didn 't have a name . It was taken away from them . By pig farmers , and tailors . Erik : Blood and honor . Which would you care to shed first ? We were under orders . Blood then . Freeze , asshole . Tailor : Come on , shoot . Who ... what are you ? Little Erik Lehnsherr . What kind of greeting is that ? Hello . Once again , my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA . These Americans are ruthless . Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey . I expect you 'll be planning missile sites of your own . Somewhere you know the American early-warning system won 't help . I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year . And so close to Florida . Missiles in Cuba ? You 're serious ? We may as well declare war . Okay . Hello , General Armivolkoff . It 's nothing . Dear comrades . The United States have dispatched war ships for Cuba . This leaves us with no choice . Comrade First Secretary . We must send in our fleet . Dispatch the fleet ! Captain , we already have our orders . Why so eager for new ones ? I lived through one war , Comrade . I 'd prefer not to start another . Battle stations , Now ! Fleet reports all weapons ready . Communications officer : From the Kremlin , sir . New orders . As of 1025 hours , the cargo vessel Aral sea , is hereby ordered to reverse course and return to port in Odessa . Communications officer : Aral Sea , come in . Aral Sea , come in . They are not responding . Officer : She 's not turning around . Aral Sea , you are ordered to turn around . Do not cross the line . Congratulations , Commander . You just averted a nuclear war . What ? Take him to the brig . What ? What just happened ?

 1x01 - Battle for Motorcity This is Detroit . Well , was Detroit ... until Abraham Kane started building a new city on top of it . Detroit DeLuxe . Kane promised everyone the city of the future . He never told them it would cost them their freedom . Most of them don 't even realize what they 've lost , but I do . Down here in Motorcity , we 've got a motto ... " Live fast , live free . " And my friends and I are going to fight Kane with everything we 've got to make sure we can do just that . Mike , slow down ! One touch and we fry , bro ! It 's incredibly dangerous ! Ah , you say that about everything , Chuck . That 's because everything you do is incredibly dangerous . See ? That wasn 't so bad . The electro-hut should be right around here . I just hope it 's got the fusion battery we 're after . Found it ! You gotta be kidding me ? ! This is it ! I can 't believe ... Wow ! Jackpot ! Vintage 2072 plasma injector , headlamp control module , mint in box , 12-point seatbelt ! We couldn 't have found this many parts if we scavenged for months ! Oh , yeah , I need that . Mike , you got your ears on ? It 's urgent ! How urgent ? I 'm , uh ... kinda busy here . Kane 's forces are about to storm our eastside gate . Wait , what ? The intel said that attack wasn 't happening until tomorrow . You sure ? Pretty sure . Uhh-uh ! The gate 's down ! Really need that battery , guys ! - We have it ! - Then get back here , fast ! Uh , we were just leaving . Not good ! Not good ! Not good ! Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Hey , buddy , I need a way out . I 'm trying , bro ! Okay , there 's an access tunnel at 9 : 00 ! You mean the one between those falling buildings ? Come on , Mike . Attention , Motorcity scum ! Abraham Kane here , live from deluxe , Where it 's safe and clean and the sun always shines ! You know , I 'd visit the hole in the ground you call Motorcity myself , but I got a thing against gutter slums , so I 'm sending a friend instead . Ding dong ! That sounds like my ultragold . Coming to keke this place apart brick by filthy brick ! Where you 're standing right now is about to be the latest addition to my utopian empire ! So welcome to the Kane Co. family ! Yeah ! I could 've done that . Cadet Chilton . You 're always sending your robots by unannounced , Abe . Maybe next time you can show up in the flesh . I 'll fix the place up a bit for ya . Or better yet , I could pay you a visit , catch up on old times . That 's funny . That 's really funny . Then why haven 't you returned since you abandoned your post , cadet ? You ran away like a coward ! That 's why ! - Listen Kane that 's ... - You 're hiding down here , driving around with your friends in your precious cars . But when the going gets tough , this coward will abandon you , too ! He 's done it before ! He 'll do it again ! Bye . Chilton 's giving Motorcity hope , and hope is a dangerous thing . Who 's Hope ? You are a thick-headed dimwit of a man child , Tooley , but loyal , and loyalty is a quality that is hard to find . You lied to me . If I 'd sniffed out Chilton 's traitorous blood when he was my cadet , all of Detroit would be mine by now ! But soon enough . Maybe I can pay you a visit , catch up on old times . I 'd like that . What a great idea . Hi , cowboy . Hey , you know no one believes what Kane said about you , right ? Yeah , of course . He 's just trying to push my buttons . It 's not working , is it ? Nah . What is getting to me is that I never know where he 's gonna be ! I only get to fight his horrifying death-dealing robots ! Yeah , wish we could get him to use some of those horrifying death-dealing robots for good . Wish all you want , Jules , but that ain 't gonna happen . He 's bad to the bone . It 's ready ! Presenting my latest creation ... Jacob 's seaweed slam ! As much as I 'd like to stick around for dessert , I gotta get back to deluxe . Running late for my intern shift . Don 't wanna keep Kane Co. waiting . Can 't risk losing our inside connection . Yeah . Hello , deluxe ! Abraham Kane here . I 'll be appearing in person tonight at Kane Co. square to unveil something new ! Something big ! Something exciting ! So come on down and say hello ! Brought to you by me , for you , tonight ! Don 't miss it ! Did you guys hear that ? ! We know where he 's gonna be ! Dude , I know what you 're thinking , and it 's crazy . Well , then call me crazy , 'cause I 'm going up there to take ... him ... down ! Heads up ! Went ahead and made some mods for you . - I think you 'll dig him . - Nice . Now that we know exactly where Kane 's gonna be , all we gotta do is go up there and grab him . No way ! I don 't like it , man ! The whole reason I came down here was to get as far away from Kane as possible ! But he comes down here and attacks us all the time . Taking a stand on our own turf is one thing , marching right up into enemy territory is another . Look , I can handle anything Kane throws at us . Oh , yeah ? What if he throws a brick at ya ? - Yeah , sure . - Okay , how about a box of scorpions ? - Um ... Tex ... - What if he throws up on ya ? I would totally throw up on him if he threw up on me , and I would totally throw up stronger and better . Check out my muscular throat and neck . Yeah , I 'm more concerned about his army of killer robots . Yeah , man , not only that , he 's bound to have defense grids , bodyguards , and every type of laser ever made , all pointed at us ! How you gonna handle that ? Simple . Hey , Roth ! - Strapping this old rip rifle on ... - No , no , no , no . What you need is something that can counter any of his attacks . Like something multi-functional ! With mag motors and radiant deflectors and ... Glad to have you on board , buddy . Hey , Claire . Aren 't you like so , so , so excited - ... about the big announcement ? - What are you talking about ? For seriously , my brain 's like totes gonna explode like for reals . Do you think you can find out ? I 'll look into it . Big announcement , huh ? Can 't believe that fit . Kane won 't know what hit him ! Ah , trust me , I think he 'll have a pretty good idea . You sure you 're making the right move here ? I 'm not running away this time . Sometimes running away is the smart thing to do . The best leaders know when to retreat and when to fight . Yeah ? Well , now it 's time to fight ! Let 's see what Kane is up to . I have to warn the guys ! Hello , deluxe ! Now we 'll see who 's the coward . Brace yourselves for the bad guys . Where are the lasers and defense grids ? This doesn 't feel right . Mike , we need to talk . Just came across something crazy over here . Sort of in the middle of something here , Jules . Wait , where are you ? No , no , no ! Turn around ! No , no , no ! We got him ! Who 's running away now ? Oops ! - Re-target ! Re-target ! - Okay , I 'm on it ! Uh-oh . What was that you were saying before ? There 's no escape ? It 's a trap . - I hate to say I told you so . - I can still take him . Thanks for finally paying us a visit up here , and just in time for the big announcement . Deluxians , congratulations ! We 've captured Mike Chilton and the Burners ! They 'll no longer pose a threat to us good citizens . You did exactly what I said you 'd do , Chilton . You abandoned the people of Motorcity , and now I can destroy your beloved sewer once and for all ! And I 'm sure the people down there will learn to embrace the deluxian lifestyle ... whether they like it or not . - What are we gonna do ? ! - Don 't worry . There 's no way they can get through the defense matrix . Those robots are way too big . - Is it okay to worry now ? - Yeah , now 's a good time . I 'm coming , guys . Burners ! You know , I 've been looking for you . This is just the sort of special Kane Co. moment You wanna share with the people you love ! Dad , let go ! Come on , this is fun ! Motorcity is ours ! Fun ? Those people are defenseless . You can 't do this . I can do whatever I want ! Ooh . Now , why don 't you stay here while daddy goes to welcome his guests . There 's still a war going on out there . Though not for long . Kane was right . I did abandon them . I was so caught up in proving him wrong that I left Motorcity totally helpless ! - Kane knew ! - Yeah , I guess he did , bro . I always get us into situations like this . No , this situation is way worse . But I know you 'll get us out of it . So get us out ! Please ! Think maybe the next time someone says " turn around , " you might wanna , I don 't know , turn around ? Pretty clear on that now . Hey , anyway you can hack into these pods ? I 'm on it . Don 't go anywhere ! Shouldn 't be a problem . Yeah ! Hee ! Get those gophers ! Okay ... - Hey , Julie . - Hi , Tooley . Hey , our name 's rhyme ! Julie , Tooley ! I 'd love to talk about that right now , but I 'm locked out of my pod . I 'm using the latest security code ... 98876 . Well , there 's your problem ! You 're using the wrong code ! There 's a new one came online just before the announcement . It 's 7776485 , uh ... What 's the number that looks like a " Z " ? - It 's a two , Tooley . - Two ! That 's it ! Thanks ! Gotta go ! That walrus is stupid ! Got the prison pod codes . I 'm in . - That 's great ! - Here goes . - Sorry ! Sorry ! Sorry ! - We 're running out of time here . I don 't know if I can get control of the pods , but I think I might be able to get the force field down . Do it ! Ha ! Owe you one , Jules . I 'll take it from here . Follow me , boys . Ooh , yeah ! Chilton ! It 's too late for them , but I 'm right here ... in the flesh ! You wanna prove you 've got the guts to stand toe-to-toe with me , to take me down , do it ! Or run away like you always do . Coward . I 'm not taking the bait this time , Abe . Mikey , look out ! This is a ridiculous amount of lasers ! We can 't keep this up ! Calculating probability of survival ! Oh ! Zero percent ! We 'll see about that . That 's it . Everybody pick a robot and drive straight at it ! - Okay , what now ? - Just do what I do ! That 's right . Come and get me . All right , Roth , your turn . Go get ' em , buddy ! Let 's play " find Julie . " I dare you to hit me ! Texas ! - I 'm wrecked . - Me , too . I can still punch , but my car won 't start . And we 're still at zero percent . Did you think about what would happen when there were no robots left to shoot at the last one ? Not really . Chilton ! Let 's finish this . I think Kane wants to talk in private . Fine by me ! Uh-oh . Ooh ! You ! You ran away from me ! I like the weather better down here . Then stay forever , crushed inside your precious car ! - You betrayed me . - I think it was the other way around . - I gave you everything ! - Yeah , lies , deceit , corruption ... Backstabber ! How could you choose this ... - ... this sewer over me . - This is not about you and me . This is about them . This battle is for Motorcity . Oops . - Hey , you were right . - About the seaweed slam ? No , about that running away stuff . You said running away was sometimes the right thing to do . So when Kane confronted me on his turf , I retreated , and he chased me down here to mine . I listened to your advice , and it worked . Thanks . Oh , yeah , right . I did say that , didn 't I ? And furthermore , I promise that I 'll be tripling my efforts in our war against the Burners , and soon their Motorcity will be no more ! - I wonder if he 'll ever wake up . - Guys like him never change . Trust me . You don 't know him like I do . - Hey , man , she 's ready . - Anyone up for a ride ? Ooh , yeah !

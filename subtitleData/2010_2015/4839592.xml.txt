 Hold on . Previously on Touch ... Calvin Norburg and Adeline Danvers flew from New York to Los Angeles just over three weeks ago , the timeline fits . Calvin Norburg has my daughter . Now , you know how much my son appreciates what you 're doing , but I want you to know , I do too . ( gasps ) Your mission is to kill the 36 . If you deviate from that plan , you are simply a godless murderer . No ! There was another kid the teller was working with in New York . His name was Jake Bohm . Imagine if we had two of them . The progress would be exponential . It would probably cut the time in half . This is my new phone number . Please , don 't tell anyone . You should 've seen Jake today . The whole class thinks he 's a stud . And we 've been dating for , like , four hours . Wow . You touch my son , I swear to God I will kill you . Now I want Amelia back . If anything happens to me or Amelia- - anything- - I promise you , Jake will be gone . What did Calvin say ? What did he tell you ? ( sighs ) He didn 't show . ( thunder rumbling ) JAKE : Human beings are hard-wired to connect . ( gasps ) We are drawn to one another by our own chemistry . ( gasps ) We produce attachment hormones that create intimacy . We build neural bridges that bond us , brain to brain ... Hey . ... heart to heart . Hey . Rain finally stopped . Yep . Little too late ; it kept me awake all night . Maybe this will help . Thanks . Those bonds , once formed , are not meant to be broken . LUCY : Hi . MARTIN ( chuckles ) : Hey , Jake . Look at you ; you combed your hair . I 'm glad you don 't have school today . You can go back to bed . No , he 's got a playdate . A playdate ? Yeah , Soleil 's mother called last night , invited him over for his first playdate ever . Great ! Jake can have fun , and we have time to plan . By the way , we need a plan . I 'll get some waffles for the microwave . Have fun . I 'll get dressed . Buddy , I wasn 't laughing at your hair . I think you look cool . ( sighs ) ( beeping ) ( beep ) ( crackling , popping ) ( gasps ) ( relieved sigh ) You know what ? Why don 't we just go out for breakfast this morning ? ( clacking ) LUCY : You know , I woke up in the middle of the night last night , and I thought she was next to me . Amelia ... had trouble sleeping , so she would make me lay with her till she fell asleep . Most nights I was so exhausted , I would end up falling asleep in her bed and then wake up in the middle of the night , her foot would be in my stomach , and ... I would just look at her ... sweet face and think , I 'm the luckiest person in the world . I haven 't done that for more than 1,100 days . - 1,100 . ( whispers ) : - I know . So ... help me . ( clacking ) Give me some quarters ? Look , uh ... as soon as we drop Jake off , we 'll go to BreakWire , we 'll start trying to run down a probable address , okay ? You 're racking up some serious digits there , little man . MARTIN : Hey , buddy . Jake , come on , we need to go , sweetheart . Hey , it 's me . Guess what I 'm doing . Watching a certain curly-haired kid and his dad get into a car . Martin and Jake Bohm . Okay , uh ... follow them , find out where they live . I 'm all over it . ( bell tolls in distance ) ( birds chirping ) ( panting ) _ _ _ _ _ - _ - Gracias . _ _ Jake , hold on . ( tires squealing ) - What the hell you doing ? - That blue car behind us , it 's been following me since we left the restaurant . Okay , so what are we gonna do ? This . ( tires squealing ) Stay here . Don 't move . Get down , Jake . Okay , bud ? Hey ! Why are you following me ? ! Get out of the car . Get out of the car ! ( grunts ) Why are you following me ? You 're crazy , man ! ( yells in pain ) Who are you working for ? ! ( radio chatter ) Who do you ... ( speaks indistinctly ) - He 's fleeing right now . - Hey ! Backup on P-3 ! WOMAN : Repeat , P-3 ! I was right- - we were being followed . ( tires squealing ) We 're good- - I don 't think we were followed . Not the way you were driving . Nice driving , by the way . ( sighs ) You 're late . Come on ! - Hi . Beth Friedman . Soleil 's mom . - Hi . - Martin Bishop . - I 've heard all about you . Thank you so much for having Jake over today . Our pleasure . Those two , they are just a fork and a spoon . I think the kids want to make cupcakes . This is my dad , Soleil 's grandfather . - Hello . - Martin Bishop . I 'm Carl . These are Jake 's parents ! Uh , actually , we 're ... Here 's my cell phone number , just in case . We 'll just pick him up later , if that 's okay . Don 't worry about a thing . They 'll be just fine . - Fork and a spoon , those two . - We 'll see you - in a couple hours . - Thank you . - Bye . - Thank you . - Bye-bye . Bye , Jake . ♪ El nombre del Padre , del Hijo y Espíritu Santo . Ave María purísima . _ _ _ En inglés , por favor . - My Spanish is not so good . - Sí . I am on a mission , but each step brings more confusion , more doubt . I 'm hoping the peace of absolution will help me on my path . I 'm afraid I don 't understand . I will explain . But first , swear to me that you are committed to the sacramental seal of confession . Of course . If you break that seal , you risk excommunication and ultimate separation from God . That is my vow , yes . Good . I have committed a mortal sin . Mm . And what sin is that , my son ? Murder . Hospital attack in Syria , do we have a confirm ? Confirm , Al Jazeera , bingo . Okay , good to go . Run it raw , straight live . Got a lot breaking here . Any chance of a Martin Bishop exclusive byline ? How about a blistering exposé on Calvin Norburg that 'll lead to a criminal indictment . - Keep talking . - We 've got proof that he kidnapped Lucy 's daughter , Amelia . Why would he do that ? 'Cause he 's a freak . He 's running experiments on her like she 's a guinea pig . - Excuse me ? - Trevor , our kids are different , okay ? Jake and Amelia 's brains are special . They 're connected to things through numbers , patterns , ratios . He found her and he took her , and he 's doing whatever research on her , mapping her brain . This sounds insane . You do realize that , right ? - Yes . - Yeah . ( laughs ) What else aren 't you telling me ? He knows about Jake . What ? He knows that I 'm his father . He knows that I 'm on the run . How do you know that ? Because he told me . When ? Last night at the gun range . You said he didn 't show . You lied . Yes , I lied . I 'm sorry . Yeah , you lied . He lied . You lied . Give me a second . Lucy , Lucy , it 's not what you think . Lucy , stop . I was protecting my son . Great , glad that 's working for you . Me- - not so much . Calvin threatened Jake , okay ? He threatened my son to my face . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Here 's the thing , Martin . Truth , not truth- - it 's either one or the other . I 'm sorry I lied to you . I was scared . Okay , I 'm , I am scared . ( sighs ) Maybe truth , I don 't know . ( sighs ) I , I don 't have a handbook for this . Neither do I , but I thought I had a partner . But I don 't think I need one anymore to be honest . Do you really think the day that we met on the pier was a fluke , just blind luck ? Because it wasn 't . Jake led me to you because he wants- - he wants- - hell , he needs me to help you find Amelia , but the best way for us to do that is through Jake , but we have to do it in his time , on his schedule . But if you really want to do this , I 'm all in . I will help you find Calvin Norburg and we will get Amelia back . I promise , no more lying . Okay . Okay . ( sighing ) Oh , no . Two tablespoons baking soda , chocolate extract , chocolate squares , chocolate chips . You like chocolate ? Do now . Mmm ... smells delicious . Hi , Grandpa . - Taste test . - Hey . - Ooh , that 's for me , oh , yes , it 's ... - No , no , stop , stop it . - Oh , no , no ... - Hey . ( sighs ) ( phone ringing ) I knew you 'd find me . Eight , eight , seven , seven . Okay , I 'll be there . Were you just talking to someone ? No , I-I was just ... ( gasps ) What , what-what 's wrong ? My stomach- - my stomach feels like it 's burning . All right , you 're gonna be okay . - Here . - It hurts , it hurts , it hurts . ( water running ) ( groans ) Just drink some water . ( gasps ) ( groaning ) Amelia , Amelia . Hey , are you okay ? Amelia . ( gasps ) KASE : You remember your name ? Adeline . Adeline what ? - Danvers . - Good . It 's just like we talked about . Don 't offer any information , no address , no other names . Adeline Danvers ? Yeah , right here . Uh , she 's sick . I 'm worried it might be her appendix . Obvious tenderness . We 'll get this checked right away . Now , what about that limp of yours ? Oh , I fell , it 's nothing . Julie , run a CT scan on this girl- - possible appendicitis- - and I 'll take this gentleman to X Ray . - Your knee will thank me one day . - Oh , but I 'm responsible for her . You did your job , you brought her to us . Now let us take care of you . No , but I-I 'm not supposed to leave her ... No torn ACLs on my watch . Hey , Adeline , I 'll just be down the hall . You let me know . DOCTOR : To your left , right there . I don 't understand . What kind of a mission are you on that involves a mortal sin ? I 'm ridding the world of false idols . False idols ? To return the world to the Creator . There are 36 souls in this world , Father , placing themselves before God . They are the ones that must die . Some already have . By your hand ? Yes . And there will be more . You can stop , you must stop , my son . No , I must not , I cannot . If you 're so certain about your path , why , why come to me ? As a servant of God , I know what I must do . As a man , it hurts . ( sighs ) I seek the peace and the strength that only God can give . You want peace , stop what you 're doing . No , I cannot stop until all the 36 are gone and the world is back in his rightful hands . Why this is up to you ? Because I 'm one of them . I 'm one of the 36 . What do you want from me ? Absolution , so I may continue my path . ( breathing heavily ) Father , are you there ? Absolution comes through forgiveness . I cannot forgive you , my son . Father , please . I 'm a man of God , the same as you . You 're a killer . See if you can pull up anything on his family , anything from his past . ( typing ) I 've been running his name on every database in the known webosphere , and I just found something new . Hmm , " Longtime librarian retires . " Frances Norburg . Two children- - William and ... Calvin . Says she 's on the board of an exclusive brain injury facility in Beverly Hills- - the Greyber Institute- - a private facility specializing in treatment and neuroeducation , made possible through private grant ... Ha , look at the name of the grantor . I 'll get the car . Nice . Just keep moving . To the right . Okay . Try 8877 . ( keypad beeping ) How did you ... ? This morning- - the microwave , Jake . Great . Hold up . That 's her , that 's Calvin 's mother . ( sighs ) Okay , let 's do it , let 's go confront her . Wait . Just give me a second , I want to try something . I 'll be right back . ( sighs ) Beautiful day , huh ? That 's why we chose this location- - sunshine 300 days a year . ( chuckles ) May I ask do you have someone in the facility ? M-My wife- - she , uh ... ( sighs ) I didn 't mean to pry . No , it 's , it 's all right . It 's , it 's actually good to talk about it . She was in a skiing accident almost a year ago . How you holding up ? I keep waiting for it to get easier . Yeah . My son William- - he was in a car accident four years ago . The car went into the water . I 'm so sorry . His official diagnosis is " persistent vegetative , " but I don 't believe that . He hears me , I know he does . I almost lost two sons that day . You have another son ? I do . William 's older brother was driving the car . He pulled William out of the water . Unfortunately five minutes had passed , the damage was done . The irony is , my son does research on the brain . Really ? Since the accident , his focus has changed . I believe he 'll find a breakthrough . You may have your wife back one day . It was very nice meeting you . Ta-da ! Oh , no , out of wrappers . I watch Cupcake Wars , and you do not serve a cupcake without a wrapper . WOMAN ( over P.A. ) : Dr. Forrest , dial 118 , please . Dr. Forrest , please dial 118 . ( indistinct chatter ) ( sighs ) ( keyboard keys click , computer trills ) ( whispering ) : Eight , eight , seven , seven . ( keyboard keys clicking ) ( trilling ) ( printer whirring ) ( panting , siren blaring ) ( panting continues ) So what did you find out ? The young man in the wheelchair is Calvin 's brother . - William ? - Yeah . He was injured in a car accident . Calvin was driving . Oh . Well , that explains the big donation to this facility . Explains a lot of things . Like Calvin studying other peoples ' brains . He 's trying to find a cure for his brother . ( phone ringing ) Let 's see . ( sighs ) Yeah . CARL : Mr. Bishop , this is Carl , uh , Soleil 's grandfather . Jake left the house , and apparently has run off . What do you mean , he ran off ? He and , uh ... and Soleil were in the kitchen making cupcakes . I was in the other room , next thing I know , he 's gone . I , uh ... I-I 'm sorry . Uh , it happened really fast . I ... I was gonna ring the police ... Please don 't do that . I 'll be right there . Jake wandered off from the Friedman house . I 've got to go . Oh , no . Um , okay . So , what should I do ? I 'll take a cab . Here , take the car . Stay here , see what you can find out . - I 'll get back to you as soon as I find Jake . - Okay .

I will be right there . _ Padre Esteban . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( rhythmic whooshing and beeping ) ( sighing ) _ CALVIN : Hello ? Calvin ? Yes . This is ... Linda from the Greyber Institute . Is there a problem ? Nu ... uh , no . Uh , quite the contrary . It 's your brother . There 's been a ... breakthrough . I 'll be right there . ( whooshing and beeping continue ) Jake ? ! Jake ? ! I 'm sorry . I 'm looking for my son . He 's 11 years old , curly hair . Have you ... ? No .

Who are you ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm Amelia 's mom . Hey , I wouldn 't do that if I were you . One shot of this will stop his heart . You get away from my brother . Where 's my daughter ? I know you have my daughter . - Security ! - Listen to me . Hey ! It 's only water . - I want my daughter ! - This woman just broke in here ! Doesn 't my foundation pay you people enough ? I don 't even want to think about what Calvin 's gonna say . Witness saw her get into a cab . I just got off with the cab company . Dispatch reported a girl matching Amelia 's description took a cab ride to the Marina Del Rey Boardwalk . Then that 's where we need to be right now .

You all right ? ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Cool . It 's like a fort . I 'm sorry about all the craziness , Jake . ( sighs ) My God , you could fill the Grand Canyon with everything I 'm sorry about . You know , I have this dream every once in a while . We 're in front of a big house , our house . We 're on the lawn playing ball . You really zing one . It 's high and I have to jump to catch it , but ... I catch it . ( chuckling ) : And I land on my ass . And the two of us start laughing . Start laughing like crazy . Together . We 're gonna get Amelia back , Jake . And I know what you 're doing is important , trust me , I know .

Do you think that 's where Calvin 's living ? ( chuckles ) It 's a good bet . Give me the address . ( opens drawer , rustles papers ) ( vehicle approaches ) JAKE : Our brains , our entire nervous systems , are designed for us to form deep , lasting bonds .

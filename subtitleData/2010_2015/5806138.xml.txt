The first two were Excalibur and Excalibur 2 : The Return of the King . The Return of the G-String ? - The King . The Return of the Dingaling . This will be awesome . This is good . Tomi Paatelainen promised to work for us . He 's a great graphic designer . He married our Stina . Now they 're living in our villa in Kallvik . You lovade to fix the lodge . - I 'm busy . You 're always like that ! You don 't do anything . Hey , I 'm working . I have to make the poster for Excalibur . Your dad is breathing down my neck . - Then hire a decorator . I don 't know any builders . Directory enquiries . May I help you ? - Mauri Mähönen , Tyrnävä . Here 's a master builder named Monkki Mähönen . It might be a professional name . - Put me through , please . Just a moment . - Hello ? This is Tomi Paatelainen , hi . - You little prick . What 's up ? I 'm in advertisement business . Film posters and graphic design . Listen , are you still doing renovation jobs ? This place is rotten . It should be torn down . This is our family villa . One should respect history ... Don 't you teach your father to fuck . Am I not allowed to peek inside the walls ? Stina , let Monkki check the building . Let 's take a look at the structure . Shit a brick and fuck me with it . It 's always like this . Well , what do you see ? - This is full of shit ! Do you smell it ? Your old bass guitar . Have you played recently ? What 's the meaning of this ? - We 're old band mates . Monkki was the drummer of Cobra . - I should 've known . Hey , cow . Don 't you know how good a bassist your hubby is ? Time to make a hole . We asked you here to fix the lodge . You can sleep in our sauna . - All right . For the lodge I have thought ... Please , take a look . A fifties-style wallpaper - a white panel ceiling and drapes from this fabric . Shit ! That flower stung me ! Fucking hell ... Tomi , I have pots and pans in my van . - Pots and pans ? Drums ? Really ? Let 's put them in the lodge . They 'll fit in there . He 's an intolerable oaf . He doesn 't listen and calls me a cow . Darling Stina , he 's a man of the people . You should try to be nice to him . You forgot the brochures on the porch . It 'd be jättekiva if you could make the lodge a little bit cosier ... Okay , but I need a full case of beer . Are you going to bring it now or immediately ? Javisst , of course . Vad is that ? I was startled . Good double bass drumming . Listen . I 'm sure he 's not going to play for long at his age . " He 's not going to play for long . " He 's a tireless ... grottman . What is grottman in Finnish ? - A caveman . It sounded really good . You 've always had good drum sounds . That 's right . - Is this the old drum set ? Stina asked me ... or rather told me to ask you - when are you going to begin your work ? Is this a labour camp ? - Of course not . No pressure from me . - How much will you pay me ? Of course we 'll pay you . what is your hourly rate ? Do you think I 'm gonna count hours ? - Of course not . It 's a thousand euros a day . In cash . - That 's quite a lot . Hey , come on , compadre . Your old lady is loaded . What are these fucking slimeballs ? It 's scallop pasta . - It 's shit , you trollop ! I want shepherd 's pie and sausages before I starve to death . And bring me the hard stuff . On the double ! Hey , Monkki . Have some mercy . - " Have some mercy . " Give me some sub . I want an advance on wages . ... 5,800 , 5,900 , 6,000 . Is the lodge going to be ready in time for our crayfish party ? I have a couple of wallpaper choices . Give me the booze . Now he stopped . - I 'm scared . You är going to Helsinki tomorrow . I 'm stuck here with that monkey man . Everything 's going to be okay . Did it go through ? What ? Are you shagging ? Yuck . It burns ! My arse is on fire ! Toni Paatelainen . Leave a message . It 's jag . Listen , Tomi ... Mähönen was in our toilet . Luckily , he 's gone now . He took our money . I hope he 's not coming tillbaka . What 's the matter , Stina ? Are you ill ? No , everything 's fine . Let 's play " Wild Beast " . Amazing women by the sea ! Do you have any Coca-Cola ? I can 't drink this straight . Stina , they 're really nice guys . Gerhard Rihmakallo is a German mushroom expert - who moved to Finland in the ' 80s . His real name is Gerhard ScheiBenhaus . He 's the king of riffs . And the singer , David Foster aka Tapio Mäkinen - is my old schoolmate . He 's working for the municipality of Tyrnävä , marking baseball lines . How do you know them ? - They are Cobra . Gerhard , you 're the brains in your band . You seem like an intelligent man . Do you understand Swedish ? Talar du svenska ? Okay , let 's try German . Hjälp ! - ' This is a new song , " David 's On Fire " . It begins with a massive guitar riff . The drumming begins with a gong . And it 's awesome - to have our bassist playing with us . Now the going 's so good that I could use a beer . Välkommen to our traditional crayfish party here in Kallvik . I have invited a couple of important co-operation partners to join us . Here 's a film director and my dear friend - Kurt " KurreKurre " von Riikonen . Maybe you could say something about your fantastic new film , Excalibur } . Four . The film 's genre is not just sci-fi . There 's also a dash of fantasy . And here 's my dear vän - the editor-in-chief of The Sensationalist , Julle Rekola . I 've had a gay old time with Julle . Our co-operation has been great . Kalle , Kurre and everyone - it 's always a great pleasure to be with real men 's men - whether on land , sea or air . Skål , everyone . To crayfish . Now I feel we should play " Lizard " . What the helvete is this ? Who the hell are you ? You have no ... Hey , Swede . Shut the fuck up . Didn 't you hear what David said ? He said " hush " . David , go ahead . - Gerhard , you had something to say . Go ahead , Gerhard . - Let 's play " Fireball " . My darling lilla Stina will now come with me to talk about your future . And I 'm going to give the Excalibur poster to a good graphic designer . And Tomi ... You 're fired . You have two days to get rid of that riffraff . Drink some water . Now we 're going to calm down ... what are you thinking ? My wife 's gone . Don 't you worry . Now we can practice in peace . Look , it 's Leather Jaska , Mullethead and Stud . But where 's Spunk ? There he is ! Spunk is coming ! TWO DAYS LATER what the helvete ? ! They 're just setting up the gear . The party is tomorrow . Hey , this guy is causing trouble . Kalle , you 're running wild . why are you rampaging ? What is happening here ? - The guys are setting up the gear . Cobra is playing tomorrow . - It 'll attract over 600 people . Cobra 's concert ? - You 're dumb as a doorknob . This is a great place . Rihmakallo said this point of land is made for festivals . Just add parking , tents , the stage and a bar . When we cut down those trees , there 's room for 15 to 20,000 people . A festival ? 50,000 people ? The lodge could be used as a jail . Do you want to go to jail , Kalle ? Cow ... I mean Stina . - Vad ? What ? Why are you always so tense ? You 're whining day and night . Tomi is a bass artist . And don 't you worry about the renovation . Spunk will handle it . I don 't have time to do it . I 'm a percussion instrument artist . Are you going to live here ? - Absolutely not . Maybe during the summer and the Christmas season . Tomi ? - Sorry , baby . This is the real me . You 're not coming here . Go away and come back tomorrow . Shay what you want . We 're coming in . - No , you 're not . Shtay away . Are you making fun of my lishp ? - of courshe not . Shtay away . He 's making fun of you . - Are you making fun of my lishp ? He 's making fun of Jouni . - Wanna get your head smashed in ? I 'll wipe that shmile off your face . - Please , go away . He 's afraid of you . - Attack ! Have a gingerbread ice cream . - I don 't like them . Have an ice jolly . - That 's not real ice cream . Everyone getsh a choc ice . I want a choc ice . - I 'll have the same . Me too . - And me . One choc ice , please . - What has happened to you , Risto ? I fell off my moped in a bend . One choc ice , please . - You have a black eye and bruises . I fell off in the same bend . - One choc ice , please . Pentti , did you crash your ATV in the same bend ? Yeah , it was a pile-up . It must be one slippery bend . - One choc ice , please . Jarmo , I guess you crashed your moped in the same bend . No , we got our arses kicked by a group of heavy metal roadies . We didn 't manage to throw even one punch . Bye . The men in our village ... - Risto is ugly and stupid . Pentti is fat . Antti is just super annoying . I bet they 're all virgins . - And then there 's Jouni . A pathetic splutterer . - Thinks he 's the leader . Have you noticed how he looks at you ? - But he 's really small . Could you imagine being with him ? - Not even if he was the last man . Take a look at their little thingies . They 're just a bunch of buffoons . I 'm not buying anything from thish shop . Jouni , why didn 't you buy ice cream ? I 'll put plenty of sausages in your fresh sausage soup . That 's nice . I like lumpsh . COMEDY , DRAMA CRIME Don 't watch your films until dawn . Then you 'll just snooze till afternoon . What is that movie called ? - Shpiderman 3 . Risto , be careful with those . Jouni is calling . Antti . - where are you ? What ? - where are you ? We 're watching Pentti 's dad 's cows . - Come to the Shkull Cave . Okay . ) ' - We 're going to rob jushtiina 's shop . What ? - We 're going to rob Jushtiina 's shop . All the cash and tenderloinsh . - Why ? Becaushe they 're fucking with ush . It 's an impossible mission . - I have a plan . Justiina is going to kill us . - What is this plan of yours ? You 've all sheen Harrishon Ford in Witnessh with those Amish guysh . Me and Antti will go to Justiina 's shop dressed ash the Amish . We 'll shurvey the shecurity shystems . There are two shurveillance camerash . A shecurity guard visitsh jushtiina 's shop at leasht once a day . He enters through the back door which has a double padlock . That 's a tricky one . But the shop has a weak point : the tin roof . The ceiling is made of shoft Haltex panelsh . Passh it around . We 're entering through the ceiling . - justiina will strangle us . We need a wild bunch . Shpecialists ! Shteven Sheagal , Shylvester Shtallone , Charlesh Bronson and Telly Shavalash ! Where are you going , Rishto ? - Mealtime . It 's my mealtime , too . - I 'm going for a swim . Let 's go , boys . Jouni , you have been in your own world recently . What do you mean ? You haven 't mown the lawn or chopped firewood . And you should clean your room . This morning , you didn 't ﬂush the toilet . Shorry . - Here 's a cucumber sandwich . Thanksh . - Don 't watch films all day . What is this movie called ? Jouni is calling . Antti . Where are you ? - On the beach . Immediately to the Shkull Cave . - But I haven 't swum yet . Okay . To the Skull Cave . I haven 't swum yet . - Now . Boysh , do you know what these are ? Rishto . - They look like suction caps . Me and jarmo will climb onto the roof ushing shuction cupsh . Seems quite difficult . - What do you mean " difficult " ? The wall is not smooth . The suction cups won 't work . They don 't adhere to a porous surface . Bugger . Ish that she ? jarmo , why are you naked ? - I left my swimming trunks at home . But why are you naked ? - I told him to swim in his underwear . He didn 't have any , so he swam in his shorts . The shorts came off because the elastic band was too loose - and he had his keys in his pocket . Why are you jumping , jarmo ? - I have water in my ear . Blimey , jarmo is jumping . So ? - It 's whatchamacallit ... Parkour ! What 's that ? - It 's city jumping . You 've seen it in Casino Royale . I 'm going to jump like a brown hare onto the tin roof . Then I 'll throw a rope to jarmo . jarmo is not able to climb the wall . - He 's going to climb the wall . Now my ear is empty . We 'll cut a hole in the tin roof with a shide grinder and lower me inshide . How do you get electricity ? - Good point . Let me think . We can borrow my dad 's generator . - We 'll use a generator . Then we can ushe the grinder - to cut a hole for me . The ceiling is a piece of cake for me . Then I 'll lower myself into jushtiina 's shop . But you said that there are two surveillance cameras . Bugger . That 's a good point . What are we going to do now ? When are we going to go to the shop dressed as the Amish ? Go swimming . Fish out Jarmo 's shorts - and the Shkull Cave 's shpare key . Happy Birthday , Jouni . Have some cake . Sit down . I 'll take a picture . 49 years. when you turn fifty , we 'll cut those sideburns . No way . I 'd look stupid . Mat " . - Where are you ? We 're driving dougnuts . - To the Shkull Cave . But I haven 't driven the lawnmower . - Now ! Okay . ) ' - To the Skull Cave ! Rishto , you 'll go to Jushtiina 's shop - and take a photo of the area where the shurveillance camera ish pointed . The camera records in B W - so you musht develop a B W photo in a dark room . Then you 'll build a mount - and shecretly hang your photograph - in front of the shurveillance camera . But I haven 't got a camera . And how do we find a dark room ? Why are you like that ? Don 't be like that ! We 'll fool the shurveillance camera - sho that I can be lowered into the store . But what if the security guard is in the shop ? What then ? - What are we going to do now ? Pentti , Antti , Rishto and jarmo , why are you messhing with me ? Jouni , you are messing with us . - Pentti is right . You have a short fuse . - A short fushe ! Fushe ... I figured out how to get rid of the shecurity guard . Pentti , you know how to weld . - Yeah . Your mother is coming , Jouni . Terttu is coming . I brought you marble cake and squash . What are you planning , boys ? Are you up to your tricks again ? - Of course not . You 're such nice boys . Goodbye . - Thanks for the cake , Terttu . Thanks . - Thanks , Terttu . Pentti , you can weld the shop 's back door shut . The shecurity guard can 't get in becaushe the door is welded shut - and he goesh home . And then I can get inshide jushtiina 's village shop . You haven 't taken into account that Justiina might be in her shop . Shit . Jouni ! - Yea h ? Your egg sandwich is on the table . Good night . What are you watching ? - All the Batmanfilmsh . It 's Jouni . Antti . - Where are you ? I 'm at home , in bed . - To the Shkull Cave ! What about Rishto , Pentti and jarmo ? - They 're not coming . They said they no longer want to be involved . Why not ? Pentti doesn 't want to borrow his dad 's generator all the time . Jarmo is afraid of the side grinder and the dark room confuses Risto . Then they said you boss around and don 't listen to their ideas . But they don 't have any ideas . Risto meant that if they had ideas . What about you ? - I have nothing else . Jouni ? - What ? What does " Amish " mean ? Come here , boysh . " Mo , do you know ' aha Tupshu shim about yen ' ! ? No . - She shald that you 're shtupid . That 's right . Guess what she shald about you , Rishto ? She shald you 're a virgin . That 's right . Guess what she shald about you , Pentti ? She shald that you 're a four-eyed fatsho . Really ? - justiina made fun of our rides . What ? That 's a bit rich ! These aren 't even finished yet . Hum ' x . ' " M - Mn " . ! 1 want to be Shteven Sheagal - 1 want to be Steven Seagal I don 't want to be Richard Gere - 1 don 't want to be Richard Gere 1 want to be Schwarzenegger - I want to be Schwarzenegger who wantsh to be Hugh Grant ? - Nobody ! Nobody ! You know that justiina is talking crap . I 'm pretty sure that I 'm not a virgin . And Pentti is not fat . He is just heavy . When we have robbed jushtiina 's shop - jushtiina 's and Tupshu 's livesh will go down the drain . They 'll have to file for pershonal bankruptcy . They 'll be poor . And they will both be begging ush for shex . Yes , where wash I ? We have eliminated the camerash , out-faxed the shecurity guard - and now I can once again lower myself into jushtiina 's shop . Jouni ... - What ish it ? What about Justiina and Tupsu ? They 're in the shop . Pentti , the answer is Antti . - Antti ? Antti . - What ? We ' ll shpray Antti with self-tanning lotion and greashe him up . He 'll be our decoy . - What does it mean ? A shtool pigeon . While Antti flexes his musclesh like Schwarzenegger - I 'm going to rob Jushtiina 's shop . Any questionsh ? - Sounds good . Here are your costumes for the youth society 's masked ball . I don 't want to go to a masked ball . You 're going . These are our costumes . Oh , that 's right . - But they 're not black . I think black is such a depressing colour . And what colour did you ushe ? - Different colours . Bloody hell . I guess we 'll have to wear these . Now it begins . Antti , have I been all keyed up ? - It 's nothing . Don 't worry . Jouni , what are we going to do ? - Don 't ashk me . Antti ? Men , attack ! Kalle , is the drummer and his band Cobra still living in the villa ? No , they 're on tour , in Germany . When will I get the Excalibur poster ? It 's on its way . just a little longer . Julle , how is The Sensationalist involved in the marketing ? I 've been thinking about a hunting trip . Let 's go and shoot a shitload of bears . We can do a story about the makers of Excalibur hunting bears . Pentti ! Oh my God ! - Do you see that ? What the helvete ? - What is this circus ? Wait a moment . I 'll take some pictures . Erkki " Slop Bucket " Sysimetsä , this is how we sell magazines . Beginner 's luck . You just happened to be there . Don 't you get smart with me . You 're writing stories about Keijo-Sinikka 's summer cottage . Sinikka has a gold record . - In the seventies , Sysimetsä ! 1973 . - You write too much . People want pictures . Here are some pictures . Look and learn . This arsehole is Antti Peräkorpi . He was flexing his muscles - to lure the shop assistants out . This is Pentti Alakarvasto . He was supposed to weld the back door shut - but a spark lit him up . This is Risto Näre . He was supposed to fool the surveillance camera with a photo . This is jarmo Komulainen . They managed to cut a hole in the roof - but Komulainen got stuck . This guy is the " brains " of the outfit . Jouni Hirvi had a panic attack and cried for his mummy in a ditch . I got the best material - when the shopkeeper justiina found out - that these nitwits tried to rob her shop . Look at this shit . I just had to start shooting video . The images are moving . - This is a YouTube hit . What will happen to those guys ? will they do time ? No , every talk show wants to have them . They 'll be touring in a helicopter and releasing records and books . Jouni got excited when he heard that they 're making a film based on them . You 're fired ! Stide , is the fake tits here ? What ? - Is the fake tits here ? There she is . Where 's Thomas ? - Julle . There 's a slight problem with my costume . I don 't have the sword ... Kalle ! - Vad is it ? Stide is going to take pictures of fake tits and Thomas . Then Stide will send them to me and I will publish them . Okay . Go , go , go . Did you say that I 'm fired ? Listen to me , Julle . I began to write for The Sensationalist in the ' 60s ... Shut up . You 're fired . Now ! Get the fuck out of here . Get out of this building . Listen ... Hey , listen ! Do you remember ... of course not . But listen ... One sunny morning , about fifty years ago - I was on my way to The Sensationalist offices for the very first time . It was spring . The air was oozing with eroticism . Urpo Lehtinen was the editor-in-chief . He gave me the nickname " Slop Bucket ' . Urpo told me to write a feature about the sinful Finnish summer . At the same time , organ repairman Arvo Hakala - was leaving his dog with his neighbour for the summer . Thank you , Alma . Have a nice summer . Arvo , try to leave the ladies alone . Otherwise , there 'll be hell to pay . - Of course . Bye . - Bye . Well , hello Seija . You 're still delivering the post . What is our route ? - First to Alahärmä . A tuning job . Then to Ylihärmä ' . An organ needs servicing . The B-foot and 16-foot pipe valves are stuck - and the woodpipes are clogged up . There 's a full renovation job in Köyrä . In Köyrä ... we 've never been to Köyrä . First we 'll take a pump organ to Nurmo . To Nurmo ? The school of Ala-Yrvä ? Helena is there . - Yes , she is . Each tiny floweret whispers the great life-givers name I have brought you an organ . Thank you , children . You can go home already . I have other things to do . It 's wonderful that you 're here . But what if the headmaster comes ? Helena , it 's been an eternity since I last kissed your lips - felt your sensitive bosom - and caressed the soft skin of your buttocks . It 's not the headmaster who will come soon . Helena ? The pump organ is working now . - Thank you , Yrjö ' . Thank you . - Yrjö Yes ' ! - This will take a moment . Okay , I 'll wait for you in the car . Helena ? - Yes ? Have a nice summer . - Likewise . Where are you , Helena ? Our pump organ has been serviced . I must pump it immediately . What is that sound coming from the map room ? Helena ? Is something wrong ? What a sight . Crikey , the pump organ repairman is pumping Helena with his organ . It 's as thick as a yardstick . Get a grip , Isotalo . And so went the summer . Yrjö ' drove the car - and Arvo drove women crazy . Hello . Is something wrong ? Hello . We have a flat tyre . Do you happen to have a jack ? Sure , we have a jack for you . I wonder if there are any raspberries in the bushes ? Let 's check it out . - Yes . I 'm Wolf Scout leader Peter Ramfeld . Heidi is a Bunny Scout leader from Munkkiniemi . We were on our way to a jamboree , when our tyre blew out . I 'm a knot course instructor and Heidi is running a first aid course . I might get to go to sauna with Heidi tonight . What was that ? A badger ? A pine marten ? Sounds like it . - That 's not a pine marten . Maybe it 's a rutting badger . - That 's not a badger . Was that all ? - Yes . Thanks for the help . Everyone 's happy now . Get in the car , Heidi . Okay then ... I had trouble writing my story - because I had been on a bender the whole summer . I had been travelling around Finland on The Sensationalist 's tab - and was stuck in a motel somewhere in Northern Ostrobothnia . But one evening , the action picked up . Two organ repairmen came in , Yrjö Kortesmäki - and Arvo Hakala , who was a superstud . Half an hour later , and the waitress was ready and willing . I never figured out why women were interested in Hakala - but the waitress was like putty in his hands . His singing sends butterflies to my stomach . Oh dear me ... - What is it ? Well ... Do you have fresh towels in your room ? Let 's go and check it out . Oh yes ! Hakala ' : downfall was the fact - that this world is full of jealous and vengeful men . Your friend is quite the ladies ' man . Well , I don 't know about that . We 're organ repairmen . We 're just doing our job . Yrjö ' was a novice drinker , so I started buying him drinks - and pumping him for information on Hakala 's female encounters . 1 realised that this is the story I 'd been looking for . " Superstud took the waitress hand and guided her to the stairs - leading to a sinful motel room . " " The waitress felt hot and cold waves going through her ... " " ﬂ-body-n I have a sensational story for you . I 'm sending it right away . Don 't puke on the ﬂoor ! - I didn 't do it on purpose . I 'm sorry . - I 'm sending you a bill . How can I contact you ? - Call me on the porcelain phone . Where 's Raili ? - She 's taking a shower . Shit ! - What 's wrong , Yrjö ? Should I drive today ? - Gentlemen ... where are you headed ? - To Köyrä ' , I think . To Köyrä ? I 'm going there , too . Can I tag along ? Life on the road must be quite wild . Well , all kinds of things happen along the way . My life 's not always this wild . - I can believe that . I was so smitten but you gave me the mitten La la la la la la , why did you make a fool out of me ? The organ repairmen , I presume . Welcome to Köyrä . Our organ is in need of service . I 'm cantor Sakari Res. Well , well , well . We have never serviced this organ . The vicar has been stingy - but soon our organ will be clean as a whistle . It 's a lead-pipe cinch ! How come every other pedalboard key is broken ? There 's a big wedding coming up . I 'll be going up the aisle - with a beautiful woman . You 're getting married ? Congratulations . I do ! I 'm playing my trouser trumpet . I 'm the vicar of this parish . Rauno Ylämäki . Hello . - Nice to meet you . Are the organ repairmen busy at work ? Yes , they 're tuning the organ . Go tell them that there 's a lunch waiting at the vicarage . Elk soup . - Thanks for the invite . What the hell ? Your Camionnette 's radiator is leaking . I 'm not a big fan of organ music . Our Sakari is such a bad organ player - that he can barely play any hymns - let alone Christmas songs . Okay , that 's enough . But now our organ will be ready for the wedding . An esteemed cantor is coming from Nurmo . He knows all the wedding marches by heart . Sakari told us about the wedding . That 's right . And it 's going to be a big wedding . My daughter Susanna and Sakari are getting married . They 're going to love each other till death does them part . That was a good one ! Whoever is holding a fart , is keeping a secret . And if shit doesn 't stink , it 's gone bad ! Ben appétit ! - The vicarage was a madhouse . We spent weeks in Köyrä . The cantor had completely crushed the organ . That 'll do ! Yrjö and Arvo beavered away . I must say , they were true professionals . A little too high . They were staying in the vicarage granary . They slept all night and worked all day . Oh yeah . I decided to observe how the situation would unfold . I lied to the vicar - that I was a poet who needed a workroom . I 'm a poet who needs a workroom . There 's always room for a poet in our granary . I know a poem . I was just fifteen when I took my grandfather 's life I taught him a lesson by tickling his ribs with my knife I wrote my best work in that granary . " Finland 's sinful summer " , " Superstud " - " Superstud and the three tarts ' 1 " Superstud sows his seeds " - " The return of Superstud " , " Superstud rides again " - " who is Superstud ? ' and ' This is Superstud " . Those magazines sold like hot cakes , and I got my nickname , " Slop Bucket " . But then the story took an unexpected turn . Arvo was a restless man . He couldn 't sleep . Good evening . - Good evening to you , too . You play the saw beautifully . Fancy a walk this night ? I don 't want to marry that farting ogre . He behaves like a pig . And my father just laughs . He thinks that Sakari is a funny guy . You cannot force love to happen . I want to run away . Arvo , it is a new work day . Today , we 're going to polish organ pipes . Arvo ? Is Arvo here ? Goddamn ... THIS IS SUPERSTUD Fucking hell ! YOU rat ! Hello ? This is headmaster Isotalo . I have a question . - Ask away . Is an organ repairman named Arvo Hakala repairing your organ ? Well ... yes . Do you read magazines ? Let 's cut his balls off - with a rusty fighting knife . Susanna ? Susanna ! Where is Susanna ? - Susanna ! Who is Susanna ? - Susanna is Susanna ! Susanna ! - I 'm going to kill him ! I 'm going to kill him ! - Kill ! Kill ! Arvo , wake up . You have to go now . Susanna , I think I love you . I love you too , Arvo . Where is he ? - where is that lothario ? Is he in the cupboard ? I 'm going to kill him ! Rauno , do you have heavier weapons in the attic or under the floor ? I sure do . Arvo ! What is this commotion ? Arvo , you 're in trouble . They 're pissed off . They hit the engine . Yrjö , thanks for everything . I 'm sorry . It 's time to break out the heavy artillery . Sakari , a little to the left . - What ? Everyone , squeeze up a bit . Taneli , chin up . Don 't look into the camera . Say cheese . Great . Get the hell out of our way . Superstud , your game 's up . It 's payback time ! Time to meet your maker , lothario ! I was so smitten but you gave me the mitten La la la la la la , why did you make a fool out of me ? Are you happy now ? Arvo Hakala was remembered by Susanna , Yrjö and Rekku the dog . Also a multitude of women paid their respects to a man - who had brought joy to their everyday lives . Ever since the funeral , there have been fresh ﬂowers on his grave - and an eternal flame . That was the beginning of my career , but it 's all over now . Don 't you want to order anything ? - No . I 've had enough . Hey , you forgot your magazines . INTERNATIONAL FUNDING FOR EXCALIBUR ?

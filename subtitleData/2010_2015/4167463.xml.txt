 I may be on the verge of discovering the true nature of Destiny 's mission . You 've had control of this ship the whole time ! Why wouldn 't you tell anyone ? The Lucian Alliance is planning an attack on Earth . I killed Riley . I suffocated him with my own hands . You are a good commander . There is no mission other than getting these people home . It was never about going home . It 's about getting us to where we 're going . That is the mission . If ever you were going to have a chance with anyone , this is probably it . I 've thought a lot about you . We need to talk . I 'm sorry ? Where 's Ginn ? She 's on Earth . Ginn told Homeworld Command that Simeon had intelligence about an attack that was being planned against Earth , and then he killed Ginn . Amanda Perry is dead . There 's been an attack . We think there might be a bomb on board as yet unexploded . I think I can help . I can tell you how to defuse that bomb . Have you heard anything ? Not yet . Day six . Shifts running continuously round the clock , just like you ordered , but still no connection . I 'm up next . You okay ? Yeah . Leg fell asleep . Okay . Checkmate . Again . You might want to put a bit of effort into it this time . Doesn 't it bother you ? We don 't know if that bomb was defused in time . You 're worried about your mom . I 'm worried about everyone . So ... Again ? Come on , take your mind off it for half an hour or so . Couple of minutes , the way you 're playing . " Also sprach Zarathustra . " It 's the theme from 2001 : A Space Odyssey . So why didn 't you just say that ? Because that 's not what it 's called . It 's called " also sprach Zarathustra , " " thus spoke Zarathustra . " It 's by Strauss . Yeah , but nobody knows it by that name , so why not just say the name that people- - look , you asked me what my favorite piece of music was . Yeah , I 'm just saying- - it 's the one piece that reminds me of the very moment I wanted to be an astrophysicist . Right , when you saw " 2001 " ? Yes . That 's my point . That people know that song only because of the movie . Song ? It 's not a song , Brody- - Oh , it 's not a song now ? You all right ? Yes . It 's you . You get me wound up with your stupid- - Hey , hey ... Colonel Young , this is Brody , come in . Go ahead . I think we have a connection . You 're aboard the Destiny . I 'm Colonel Young . Who are you ? I 'm Ginn . What happened ? ♪ Stargate Universe 2x14 ♪ Hope Original Air Date on March 28 , 2011 - - sync , corrected by elderman - - I had some trouble breathing at first . Dr. Perry 's condition was difficult to adjust to- - Eli . Ginn ? It 's you ? Really ? What happened then ? Your people from Homeworld Security asked questions about the Lucian Alliance . I answered as best I could , and then ... Nothing . Nothing ? It 's strange . One moment I was answering questions , and the next thing I knew I was sitting here . What happened ? Why didn 't I return to my own body ? Ginn ... While you were connected to Dr. Perry , one of your people , Simeon , he killed you . We received confirmation that Dr. Perry died on Earth as well . That-that can 't be true . Then how am I still here ? Heya , T.J. You burning the midnight oil ? Well , since Rush broke Destiny 's master code , all these ancient medical devices are now accessible to us , so I 'm kind of taking a crash course on them , although it would help if I were fluent in ancient ... You okay ? Oh , yeah , I 'm , uh ... Feeling a little under the weather , trouble sleeping . I was wondering if you could give me something . A good night 's sleep would do me wonders . Yeah , yeah , sure , hang on . I , uh , I got just the thing . Let 's see . Here , just got to take this , mix it with water , give it about a half hour or so . And , uh , it 'll calm you down . Help you relax , and maybe- - It doesn 't make any sense . Well , obviously we don 't know as much about the stones as we thought . Look , Ginn was , uh ... Ginn was murdered , so therefore , the connection wasn 't properly severed with the communication device . Now , perhaps her consciousness became displaced . Displaced ? Floating around , like a radio signal ? Chloe just happened to be the one to tune into it . But why her ? We 've had people on stone duty 'round the clock for days now . Why didn 't any of them connect with Ginn ? Well , perhaps because Chloe was the only one to fall asleep . Her consciousness relaxed just enough to allow an opening for a connection . I don 't know , Colonel . It 's just conjecture at this point . I 'm sorry , but the bigger question here is , if Ginn is in Chloe 's body , whose body is Chloe connected to ? Yeah . How long have you been feeling like this ? A few days now . " A few " meaning ... A week , maybe two . Maybe a month ? Your blood pressure 's high . 176 over 110 . I used to take blood pressure pills . Hypertension . I ran out shortly after we got to Destiny . Why didn 't you tell me ? Well , there 's nothing you could do about it . It 's not like you could write me another prescription . I have medicinals that could help . Tea leaves have been effective in improving circulation- - T.J. , I was feeling fine . I didn 't think it was a problem . Hypertension is often symptomless , but dangerous . Didn 't your doctor tell you this ? Okay . Look , one of these ancient machines is used for diagnostics , including bloodwork , so I 'm going to run a few tests . I just think a good night 's sleep is all I 'm going to need . Probably . Let 's just be sure , okay ? Nothing . So whoever Chloe is connected to , they 're definitely not on Earth . Wow , look at that face . That can only mean good news , right ? May I come in ? Yeah . Your kidneys are failing . End-stage renal disease . Both of them ? Kidney disease tends to attack both kidneys at the same time . Okay . Okay , can we do anything ? Any of your-your medicinals ... No . The problem with kidney disease is by the time you have symptoms , it 's already too far advanced . On Earth , the next step would be dialysis . Um ... The machines in the infirmary , do any of them- - No . I already checked . It 's mostly testing equipment , some devices for use during surgery , but nothing for dialysis . The only other option for treatment would ... Would be a transplant . Rush killed him ? Chased him halfway across a desert planet . I wanted to go too , but ... Oh , I 'm glad you didn 't . I 'd hate to see you get hurt . Hey , I-I wasn 't going to get hurt . I was just so ... I had to do something . After what he did , I wasn 't- - Whoa . Uh , no , it- - it 's just ... I 'm sorry . I ... No , no , no , no , it-it 's okay . Believe me , there 's nothing more I want to do right now than kiss ... you . What 's going to happen to me ? Is there any way that I can get back into my own body ? After you ... The next planet we stopped at ... It was beautiful . We buried your body there . Had a memorial service . It was , uh ... Then where will I return to ? I don 't know . I mean , we don 't even know who Chloe is connected to on the other end , if-if she 's safe . I 've been trying to remember more , but I just can 't- - What ? What 's wrong ? Ginn ? Ginn ! Help ! Somebody help ! Hey ... You all right ? What just happened ? I don 't know . I 'll be right back . As far as I can tell , there 's nothing physically wrong with her . So , do you have any idea what caused it ? I have no idea . It was weird . We were just talking , and then suddenly she was choking . No reason . Well , Ginn was strangled by Simeon . Now , brain function is really just a series of electrical signals , energy which is no doubt the foundation of how the stones work . Now , she was murdered before she was disconnected . So , what , the energy was disrupted , resulting in some kind of glitch that made her replay the event ? Do you think we should disconnect the stone ? If we disconnect , who knows what 'll happen to Ginn ? We may not be able to get her back . Eli , if she has another attack , Chloe could be harmed . But T.J. just said there 's nothing physically wrong with her . I just think that we should study this , see if there 's some way that we can save Ginn without harming either of them . I agree . It warrants further study . All right , let 's go ahead . We 'll keep an eye on her . Hopefully this is a one-time event . Sir , there 's something else I need to talk to you about . Transplant ? How soon ? As soon as possible . Well , we can 't connect to Earth , so using the stones to bring a doctor onboard is out of the question . Yes , sir . Given the obvious limitations of this ship , is that type of surgery even possible ? We have access to more ancient devices as well as a pretty extensive medical database since Rush cracked the code . Anything in there about organ transplants ? Probably . I don 't know . I 've just begun to search through it all . All right , well , sounds like you 've got to get back at it . Sir , listen , in order to do this procedure , we 're going to need a compatible donor . Well , you have the records of everybody 's blood type . We 're also going to need to tissue-type to get a thorough match . Okay . It 's going to be extremely difficult . There 's not that many people on board this ship . To get an adequate match , it 's a long shot at best- - T.J. , let 's just ... First things first . Start testing , let 's see if this is even possible . Yes , sir . Okay . T.J. ? Oh , hey , thanks for coming . I cross-checked blood types . There 's 18 people on board the ship who are compatible with Dr. Volker . Among them are you two . It 's not too complicated . I just need to draw some blood if that 's okay . Let 's do it . You first ? I 'm a marine . We 're always first . So , uh , what are the chances of getting a good match here ? Well , it 's a matter of degrees . We 're looking for certain genetic markers on white blood cells . No one on board the ship is related to him , so that rules out the best possible match , but hopefully we can find one close enough that warrants doing the transplant . T.J ... You 're gonna be okay . You can do this . Yeah . Piece of cake . How 's it going ? Well , Rush has some ideas , but we 're still working on it . How are you doing ? I feel ... different . It 's not like the last time I used the communication stones . Well , what 's different ? I mean , aside from the choking part . Something just doesn 't feel right . We 're gonna figure out what 's going on here . I promise . I 'm not gonna lose you again . I heard about Dr. Volker . Yeah , tough break . You know , this surgery is fraught with danger , even in the best of circumstances . Are you compatible ? Sorry ? Your blood type . Are you compatible ? No . I 'm just checking . Go on . Look , I don 't want to lose anyone on this ship , Colonel , but the fact is , a transplant risks not just one life , but two . I 'm not just gonna sit back and let the man die without at least trying to figure out something . T.J. , we need you in Ginn 's quarters , now ! I 'm on my way . Hurry ! Eli , what 's happening to me ? Ginn ? No ! Help me ! Chloe ? Chloe ? No . Ginn . What happened ? You had another choking attack . You switched with Chloe for a minute there . Look , when you switched with her , where did you go ? Was there anyone else there with you ? No . I don 't , um ... I remember not being able to breathe , and then I woke up here , just now . Colonel ? Yeah . I , uh , I checked with Corporal Barnes . The connection wasn 't cut at any time . Really ? Then how was Chloe able to switch back with her ? See , I don 't believe that Chloe is connected with anyone at the other end . I believe her consciousness has been in her own body the entire time . Suppressed by Ginn 's ? How is that possible ? I don 't know . I 'll have to further study the communication device . We should pull the stone . No , no , no . We have to find out why this is happening first . Not at the risk of Chloe 's life , Rush- - this is crucial to understanding how these communication stones work- - figure it out , okay ? Because the next time she has an attack , I 'm going to pull the stone . No hesitation . I don 't want to hurt Chloe . Yeah , I know , I know you don 't . I agree with Colonel Young . If I start choking again , disconnect me . Hopefully we find a solution before then . Solution ? To the situation . Chloe ? What 's going on here ? Is it you ? Yes . Matt , what happened ? Ginn connected with you when you used the communication stones . Ginn ? I-I thought ... I thought she was dead . Are you okay ? Yes , I 'm fine . Corporal Barnes , did you just disconnect the stones ? No , sir . Still active . What do you mean ? She 's still connected to me ? Do you feel any different ? Can you sense someone else , you know , inside your brain ? What ? Ginn ? Yes . Oh , man , this is nuts . What happened ? You switched with Chloe for a moment there . Wait a minute , you don 't remember it ? No , it 's ... It 's all so strange . I feel weaker . Here , sit down . I 'm sorry , can you just excuse us a second here ? Okay ? Eli ? Hey ... what ? I-I don 't know . I mean , we can 't be sure of anything until- - Eli ... Her energy might be decaying . The radio signal , getting weaker , harder to keep tuned in . Matt ... Even without disconnecting the communication stone , we might not have much time before ... We lose Ginn completely . How 's that translation program working for you ? Good . A lot of information here , some good stuff about organ transplants . Hey , you see this ? According to the database , it 's a kind of a ligature device . Cuts and cauterizes at the same time ? I thought it did something like that , but I could never get it to work . Hey , T.J. , there 's a whole section here on a stem cell-like procedure for post-op anti-rejection . It 's only 176 pages . A little light afternoon reading . Still a lot of other potential post-operative drawbacks . Infection , high blood pressure , erectile dysfunction ... Why is that funny ? After everything that 's happened recently , we can 't be sure this thing 's even working properly anymore . What is it you 're trying to do ? We 're trying to see if there 's a way we can intercept Ginn 's signal and download it into the ship 's memory banks . Okay , then what ? What is she ? She 's just another program in the ship 's computer ? Well , she 'd be preserved , for the time being , until we can determine the viability of downloading a consciousness into another body . Colonel ? T.J. ? We have a match . Two , actually . Tissue-typing takes a look at six specific antigens in the blood of the recipient and the donor . The best compatibility , obviously , is a six-antigen match . It happens most often in families . The two of you , you both have a four-antigen match with Dr. Volker , which is surprisingly good , considering . The equipment that you used , how accurate is it ? Because I want to make sure- - I 'll do it . Sergeant , listen to me . There are a lot of risks involved in this procedure , and you don 't have to decide right this instant . Think it over . No need , sir . I 'm good to go , Lieutenant . The ancients wrote about a procedure to eliminate post-operative rejection of transplanted organs . It involves removing bone marrow stem cells from the donor prior to surgery , and then implanting them into the recipient at the time of the transplant . It produces a state called mixed chimerism , which is basically an immune system that blends elements of both the recipient and the donor . You need some bone marrow . So go ahead and take it . Okay . I can give you something to put you to sleep during the procedure- - don 't worry about it . We 're short on meds . You don 't need to waste any . It 's really painful , Ron . It requires sticking a large-bore needle into your hip bone . The pressure- - The-the sooner you do it , the sooner it 's gets done . All right . I 'm going to need you to lay on your stomach . Thank you . No big deal . Well , yes , it is . It is a very big deal . You 'd do the same thing for me . Okay . I 'm going to need you to hold really still . Ready ? I was ... That was a joke . Just kidding ... Okay , well , knock it off . Okay , okay . The Colonel said you and Dr. Rush were working on something with the communication device ? Yeah , no luck . Okay , so what 's next ? We 're kind of running out of time here . Matt ? Chloe ? She 's switching back and forth more frequently now . How you feeling ? Weird . Tired . This whole thing 's affecting both of them . Am I still connected to Ginn ? Yeah . But Rush is working on it . We 're gonna figure this out . Is she all right ? Yeah . Well ... She 's fading . We 're trying to figure out a way to preserve her consciousness without harming you . I 'm fine . Don 't worry about me . Do what you need to do to help her . No , not at the risk of hurting you . I won 't let that happen . No one will let that happen . Did we ... switch again ? Ginn . I 'm sorry , will you excuse us a second ? Look , how long is this gonna go on ? She hasn 't had another choking episode . Yet . Why risk it ? Look , man , I-I know you miss her . I know how much it hurt to lose her- - This isn 't about me , Matt . I 'm trying to save two people- - What 's going on here ? Chloe ? No . Amanda Perry . Mandy ? Yes , Nick . It 's me . I wondered if you were in there , if there was ... Any chance that you survived . We think Dr. Perry has been in there the whole time , but both she and Ginn are fading . Chloe 's becoming more prominent now . We 're going to have to act fast on this , Colonel , otherwise we 're going to lose both of them . Amanda 's consciousness is already far weaker than the other two . All right . Well , do we have any solutions yet ? Well , I 've had no luck with the communications device , but I do have another idea . The neural interface chair . Now , I believe with that , we can isolate each consciousness and upload them into Destiny 's memory bank . Like Franklin . Wait , like what ? I 've seen and spoken to Dr. Franklin many times now on the bridge . So that 's what happened to him ? He was uploaded to the ship ? Well , I can 't say for certain , but I do know that Destiny has a neural link with the people on board this ship . It 's caused us to see things before . Are you seeing him now ? No . I managed to sever the link shortly after your experience with the alien battle simulations . Always the chair with you . Well , you asked for a solution . Well , it didn 't work the first time , when Chloe was becoming an alien . Yeah , this is different . I know what we 're dealing with here . So there 's no danger to Chloe at all ? I didn 't say that ! Did I say that ? I 'm going to have to remove some of the safeguards I put into the chair 's programming , yes , but I 've done the calculations . The chances of her being harmed are minimal . Colonel , this is not our decision to make . You know , guys ... I , uh ... I 've got to go stretch my legs . I 'll be back in a couple minutes , okay ? Yeah . I have never liked hospitals or doctors . Well , this is not a hospital , and T.J. is no doctor , so you 're fine . Thanks , that 's comforting . Mm-hm . All things considered , though , I wouldn 't want to be anywhere else . I hear that . Yeah , I miss home . Sitting in the backyard , warm summer night , sippin ' a beer , staring at the stars through my telescope . I love that backyard . All right . You ... sure ? I don 't want to disconnect the stone and risk losing them forever . We need to do this . Whatever it takes to help them . Okay . Hey , T.J. I just stopped by the infirmary . Volker looks worse . I know he and Greer are ready to do this . I know you 're scared . This is a major surgery . It is complicated , and it 's dangerous- - and if you do nothing , Volker dies . I do the surgery , and they both could die . That is a risk that both men have accepted . Listen to me . I 'm not gonna order you to do this because you know that it needs to be done , and you know that you are the only person who can do it . It 's not ... Permanent , Mandy , but hope is to find a way of putting you into another body . A fresh start . That 's been my dream ever since the accident . Where 'd they go ? Who ? Oh . Wow . This place has really filled up . As close to a backyard as we 're gonna find on this ship . You and me ? We 're gonna be fine . You can trust that . Greer , where the hell are you ? Took a little walk , T.J. Gettin ' some fresh air . Is Volker with you ? Yes , I am . I thought a little music might help you relax . The theme to 2001 ? Ah ! It 's not very relaxing , is it ? No . You ready ? How will I exist ? You 'll live inside Destiny 's computer system . You 'll be a part of the ship . Literally . And when I 'm switched off , what will happen to me then ? Now , that can 't happen . The only thing that we can switch on and off is the ability to communicate with you . Remember , this is only temporary . The SGC knows of alien races with the ability to download a consciousness into a host body . Hell , the ancient database may even have information on it . We just need to find it , and figure out a way to do it here , on the ship . I know , I know it isn 't perfect , but we can be together . Just to see you , talk to you , hear your voice . It can be enough . Can 't it ? Ginn ? Okay , right there , that 's the lumbar vein coming off the back of the renal vein . You want to cut that . Okay , got it . T.J. , have you started the surgery yet ? Uh , yes , sir , about 30 minutes ago . Well , Ginn had another choking attack . Is she all right ? Yeah , she 's okay . It passed , but I 'm not waiting any longer . We 've got to do the transfer now . I 'm going to be here another four or five hours , sir . I can 't leave . All right , well , keep going . We 'll manage . Copy . Go ahead . Okay . Ready ? The retractors , please ? I want you to pull up . All right , I 'm reading two energy signatures , each separate from Chloe 's . Now , are we sure that that one 's Chloe 's ? Well , it appears to be the dominant presence , so I think we can safely assume that it 's Chloe . I 'm transferring the other two . She 's choking again ! Turn it off . I can 't , the transfer 's already begun . What happened ? I don 't know . Destiny 's mainframe just had a huge power surge . We lost imaging , database , everything . What 's happening ? Must have been some kind of power surge . Is it still transferring ? I don 't know . The mainframe is inaccessible . Anything ? No , it 's crashed . Why ? I don 't know ! Why , did you fix it ? No . The ship must have overcome the problem . At least partially , at any rate . There 's still several systems malfunctioning . Well , can you turn the chair off now ? Yeah , but I can 't be sure the transfer 's been- - I don 't care . Turn the chair off now . We don 't have time ! I need to finish this ! Hang on . I think I 've got the ligature device back online . The database is still down . Tamara ? Who are you ? What ? I 'm Amanda Perry . Dr. Perry , how did you- - no time to explain . You need to finish the surgery . T.J. , what 's wrong ? You 're not real- - listen to me . I 'll help you . I have access to the entire medical database . Trust me , Tamara , I can help . Okay , tell me what to do . Who are you talking to ? No one . I 'll tell you later . T.J ... I 'm fine ! Just let me do this . Go . All right , the first connection you need to make is to the renal vein . Attach it to the external iliac vein . Did it transfer ? Yeah , I believe so . Two new programs have suddenly appeared in Destiny 's memory bank . One of them , in fact , is active somewhere on the ship right now . Doing what ? Okay , the artery 's attached . Go ahead and unclamp it . It 's pink . That 's good . That 's it . You did it . Chloe ? Yeah . I 'm all right . Okay ... Okay . So far , so good . I started the stem cell infusions . Over time we 'll wean him off of it as he reaches a chimeric state , but hopefully his body won 't reject the kidney . We just have to wait and see . He won 't reject it . Great , no pressure . Okay . You did good . Colonel Young ? Yeah , go ahead . I need you in the communications lab . David ? Yeah , it 's me . We just made the connection . We had a problem with the communication device on our end . Took a few days , but our guys finally fixed it . David ... The bomb was defused . Washington is safe . Nicholas ... It worked . Thank you . How do you feel ? Free . Have you peed yet ? What kind of question is that ? Well , the kidneys clean the blood , they process the waste- - No , I know what they do , for f- - yes . I 've- - yes , okay ? Good . Good . Hey ... You need to walk , just a little bit around the infirmary . Helps the body heal . Oh , I gotta go . I 'm on duty . I 'll , uh , I 'll stop by later . I 'll help you . Are you sure ? Mm-hm . All right . There might be a little infection setting in there . I 'm fine . Yeah . No , I-I know . Just gonna change the dressing . I was getting worried . I saw your consciousness in the memory bank , but you hadn 't appeared to anyone yet , so I didn 't know what to think . I know it 's only temporary . It is . I promise , but for now , it 's the best we can do . I 've thought about what you said . Just being here , seeing you , hearing your voice ... It is enough . - - sync , corrected by elderman - -

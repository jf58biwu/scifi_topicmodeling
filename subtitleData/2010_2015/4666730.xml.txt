I just got a horrible feeling . what are you doing ? That whole thing 's an Air Force train . What ? paint them ... Math Camp ! please ? Cream on the side . - Sure . - He 's so sophisticated . - Shut up . I like coffee . - No one likes coffee . have these hooks ... They do ! For when the trains are loaded on the transport ships . Every car in that crash had hooks . all right ? guys . Am I the only one who doesn 't understand what any of this means ? shut up . - You shut up . - I don 't like it when you call me that . Smartin . Let 's just go cry about it . Dr. Woodward had that map . He drove onto the train tracks . Maybe there was something he wanted to ... will you guys just shut up ? Maybe he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself . That 's a dumb idea . He had a gun . Why not use that ? hanging ... Pussy ! Stop taking the fries away . - I ordered these for a reason . - Excuse me . Could we get another order of fries ? Because my friend here is fat . chompers . At least I don 't have to use a booster seat . You could jump from a building . that 's not really effective . what would the Air Force have on the train ? shut up about it . we can 't talk about this . seriously . Do you really wanna take a chance too ? easy ! sir . Deputy . I 'm told this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion . the local authorities as well as how to help you . It 's all under control . It 'll be a very fast clean-up . is there ? Deputy . I understand you have concerns about our cargo . yes . that 's not gonna be possible . I 've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna wanna know what 's taking place . Which town is that ? Lillian . if you 're asking me if we had any dangerous properly I can assure you the answer is " No . Colonel ! Excuse me . They gave me the runaround for two hours before they allowed me to talk to anyone . Jack . refused to show me the manifest . He told me they 're carrying mostly airplane parts . I don 't buy that . Jack . Airplane parts sort of make sense . there 's something else going on . They 're taking molds of tire tracks . Why would they be doing that ? Who would they be looking for ? And they 're packaging these weird little cubes into these crates . Weird little cubes ? they 're loading them onto these red trucks . There are dozens of them . I think you need to go check it out . And I think you need to take a break . I 've been telling you this since Elizabeth . but you need to take a vacation . Go home . Take off the uniform . Go fishing . Give your son a hug . I 'm not sure Edie 's paying you to listen to the radio . Breen ! Sheriff . What 's that ? Walkman . It 's like a stereo . Play your own cassette tapes . You want to try ? I don 't think so . just what we need . my friend . Sir . Sheriff ? Sheriff ? in scene ... Where is it ? Where 'd you learn to do this ? Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make-up Handbook . Joe . We need some more footage of the train crash . Obviously . You know that train model you just made ? - Your cargo train . - I want to blow it up and film it . Let me blow it up . Yeah . Sure . - Mint ! - Gnarly ! Yes ! will you ? It 's fine . They can blow it up . I don 't care . You want to see it ? The train ? My train model ? The train I made ? that 's bitching . that 's like the third time it 's happened . What the hell ? So how am I supposed to be a zombie ? with no soul . Dead eyes . Scary . Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin ? - For English ? Yeah . - Yeah . but hungry for human flesh . Like she wants to turn somebody into a zombie . 'Cause that 's Kind of what zombies do . yeah . That 's really good . Not bad . - Really ? - Really . Careful ! There was a gas spill . I don 't even know how much fuel I lost . You don 't seem to be asking very many questions . Mr. Blakely . he 's not the Sheriff . - Doesn 't matter . I think this is most likely a bear attack . Security cameras showed nothing . Someone had erased ... you heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning ? Negative . Still no word . and send units over to their houses immediately . You copy all that ? we ' re getting a lot of unusual calls . What kinds of unusual calls ? I 've never seen this kind of thing before . what the hell am I supposed to do ? The insurance company guy thought I was joking with him . Look at my Bonneville over here ! They 'd have to have a winch to take that out . Izzy ? I was thinking you should talk to Louis Dainard . and I wouldn 't be surprised if this was some sort of sick retribution . - My generator is missing . - The phones aren 't working . - My dog 's gone . Disappeared . - The phones won 't produce a signal . Call the station and file a report . I 'll have someone come out and take care of each one of you . Okay ? Lucy ! Lucy ! I got four guys on this case ... People don 't feel safe around here . You know why ? Because they 're not . We need to get the National Guard ... Air Force hasn 't answered a damn question . They 've got trucks over at Woodward 's house . Ben heard they were looking for Woodward 's research . Research ? What the hell ? a scanner in his hand . Like a Geiger counter . but they 're taking molds of tire tracks . That means they 're looking for someone . Now what does that mean ? Have you seen Lucy anywhere ? No . I 'm sure she 's around somewhere . I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there . I ate those . no problem . I 'll find something . - Hey ! - You got to be kidding . will you ? you got power down at the station ? On and off And Brook County 's in the dark . will you ? the Air Force is looking for a car . Alice 's dad 's car . They 're taking tire prints from the crash site . Over . I don 't want to hear about it . This is what I 've been talking about . They could be monitoring us right now . shut up . Over . And the military is at Woodward 's house looking for his research . Whatever that means . You cannot flake out on me and be a dick . Are you gonna come and help me tomorrow or not ? I need you to make Alice a zombie again . Okay . I 'll do the make-up . Oven The cables are gone - All the poles are empty . Same thing over here in Rose Hill . Somebody took the damn wires down . Holy shit ! you got anything in Lillian ? you copy ? We got a half mile of copper missing . Lines are back up at M-38 . Rooney 's out at the junkyard . I ' ll give you an update when I hear back . I wanna know who took them . Twenty microwaves gone from my inventory . things are going missing . people vanishing . Belmont County 's without power . You know what this feels like to me ? This feels like a Russian invasion . I don 't think that the Russians have anything to do with what 's going on in town . But I am calling the curfew because of these exact concerns . I say it 's the Soviets . but we need Sheriff Pruitt back . We 've got good people working on that . Mr. McCandless . my ham radio is a mess ! but it 's distorted . And I don 't know what it is . Have you heard that ? please ? It was like having my radio hijacked . I 'm sure that must be very annoying . do you ? Sure I do . 13-2-0-1 ... why don 't you get in touch with Vicky . you seen Milner ? sir . I haven 't . there 's a huge sinkhole by my garage ! - It sunk almost a foot ! - I 'll take care of that . Tom . Tom ! You seen Milner ? Have you tried his office ? Have I tried his office ? What are you gonna do about the power ? It 's been out for two days . Rosko . Rosko . I need you to get every radio we have and you tune them to those frequencies . - Understand ? - No . Milner . - Yeah . Don 't you have a radio scanner with a descrambler ? at home . - Whatever . Get it . Bring it down here and set it up for me . Would you please ? what is this ? I think the Air Force is using unassigned channels ... Hey . He was at my house yesterday morning . You aware of that ? We brought him in for the car lot and other stuff . He 's clean . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd inform your son that my house is off-limits . And so is my daughter . I think the make-up was better yesterday . it 's good . I think it looks good . I should 've cleaned up my room . Did you make all these models ? Yeah . That one is the Hunchback of Notre Dame . We watched that one on TV . This is the train they want to destroy . Looks real . It looks so old . that 's dry brush technique . It 's when there 's a coat of paint and then you put something like Euro Gray over it . Euro Gray ? there 's like 14 different grays . It gets crazy . What was that necklace ? The one you were holding at the train crash . Was it your mom 's ? My dad gave it to her the day I was born . She wears it all the time . used to . And ... It was bad how she died and ... But my dad got it back . what the hell ? No one knew where you were ! We 're here . - You got to play the soldier . - I thought you were calling Evan . Evan blew us off . He 's a pussy ! Excuse me . It 's okay . You got to do it . You 're the only one . what the hell you mean they found my dog in Brookville ? That 's another county over ! we 've got nearly 30 calls but the thing is the calls coming in aren 't local . It 's like they all just ran away in every direction . she just doesn 't disappear . calm down . Just tell me what she looks like . She 's got dark hair . It was in rollers . Do you know what rollers are ? so ... Hang on . unable to recover data . That 's definitely Air Force . but what does it mean ? What are they doing transmitting on these frequencies ? - Maybe it 's not even Air Force . - I bet you five bucks it 's Air Force . - Five bucks ? - Yeah . We 're gonna need units to prepare for Operation Walking Distance . What did he say ? " Operation " what ? Walking Distance . What 's this ? He worked at Romero Chemical . Found out some things the company was doing . I thought you should know . Are we gonna get in trouble for being here ? Production value . Stop talking about production value . I think the Air Force is gonna kill us . - Cary . - Don 't cover my mouth ! We just made this discovery today . You understand this is top secret ? Of course . I would never have given you this information unless we had worked together in Vietnam . - Those were hard times . - I 'd rather not talk about it . Understood . too . Nothing so far . - How much more is there ? - About 60 more boxes in the basement . more tax returns ? Woodward will tell us where it is . What the hell is that ? Joe . Mr. Lamb . Get in the car . that 's my film . What the hell ? Is it me ? but we operate on a need-to-know basis . Why are your trucks sweeping the town ? We will be out of your way shortly . then I 'm sure you won 't mind me contacting D.C. Talk to some friends about " Walking Distance . we 'll do it that way . Deputy ! Let 's talk . Just not here . for the both of us . Dealing with anything . Just us . I 'm gonna make this as simple and as clear as I can . You 're not friends with Alice Dainard . I don 't mean " Maybe . " I don 't mean " Yes . I mean " No . I 've known Louis Dainard for a lot of years . He 's been nothing but trouble . Your mother used to say he 's not such a bad guy . that he was sad . I tried to be good to him . not any more . I will not allow him or his daughter in this house . doing projects or whatever it is that you do . That 's it . I hope we 're clear on that . We 're not clear . What 'd you say ? We 're not clear . You and I aren 't clear about anything . We couldn 't be less clear . Just because Mom died doesn 't mean you know anything about me . You don 't . either . She 's kind . We 're not gonna have this discussion right now . - She 's nice to me ! - I don 't care what she is ! selfish son of a bitch . 000 people in this town who are scared out of their mind . They 've got one person to rely on . but now it 's just me . move ! Let 's go . Move ! drop your weapons . Put your hands on the car I 'm here to see Colonel Nelec ! He told me to meet him here . You 're under military arrest . Drop your weapons . Where 's Nelec ? do you ? looking for evidence . What you knew . How you knew it . Who else might know . I remember you in the lab . but that is no excuse for doing what you did here . why don 't you just tell me where you put your research and who else knows about it . I know you had someone document the crash that night . Tell me who that was and I will help you . we will take care of you . - when you take care of people . - It is mine . He is mine . I 'm gonna bait him and catch him . you know . As I am in him . too . Are you ... Were you sleeping ? Before . Earlier . No . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . You want to come in ? Yeah . Power 's still out . Room 's still messy . I couldn 't sleep . I was thinking . I wanted to tell you something before tomorrow . Don 't let Charles blow up your train . I don 't think it 's right . I know he 's your friend . He 's so bossy . But I 've known him since kindergarten . He 's really nice . He shouldn 't always get what he wants . who always gets what they want ? I know I don 't know you at all . Even though it sort of feels like I do . Do you not feel like that ? I totally do . I 'm just kind of in shock at this entire conversation . Power 's back . no . Keep it . It 's ... it 's so weird . Watching her like this . Like she 's still here . that I existed . He drank that morning . My dad . He missed his shift . the day of the accident . He ... He ... He ... He wishes ... I know he wishes it was him instead of her . too . Don 't say that . He 's your dad . Is ... Is this normal ? No . This is new . Want to tell me where you were ? Or should I tell you ? Sit down . I should go to bed . I want to talk to you . I said sit down . I don 't want to sit down ! Then go . Be just like your mother and leave . Dad ... Go ahead ! Go ! Go ! Alice ! Alice ! Alice ! Wait ! I 'm sorry ! Alice ! Ally ! Alice ! Ally ! Ally ! Firelight at 0500 hours . Operation Walking Distance is in effect . T-minus four hours to evacuation . Evacuation in T-minus four hours . Why are you not reacting ? That thing went through my wall ! I told you not to pick it up in the first place . What are you so angry about ? That I 'm not gonna let you blow up my train ? That 's part of it . Just a part . Hey . Tell your sister that Donny from Olsen 's broke up with Karen . That shit ended about a week ago . What 's your problem ? My whole movie 's a disaster because of you . - I know my dad 's being a turkey . - Whatever . - We 're still gonna finish your movie . - It 's not about the movie . What are you talking about ? Of course it is ! Just forget it . Why ? There 's nothing wrong ! We 're gonna finish the movie ! I can get the camera back . I know where my dad put it . We can still make the festival . - It 's not about the movie . - Then what is it about ? do you ? It 's obvious . you 're a dumbass . you started getting all weird . all of a sudden . Your movie was over ! That 's what you said ! You were upset ! my God . - I gave you a camera ! I helped you ! Don 't pretend like you did this for me . and you know it . This was never about me . This was always about Alice ! Action ! I 'm going to stay here and investigate . I think it 's safer if you leave town for a couple of days . I don 't like it . This case - These murders . what am I supposed to do ... you 're the one who wanted the wife in the movie . Not so you could fall in love with her . What do you care what I think about Alice anyway ?

I 'm here to discuss your involvement with Romero Chemical ? I was the one that developed the special compound to turn all these humans into zombies . but it got out of hand .

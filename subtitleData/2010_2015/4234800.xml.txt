 No . Angelo . I 'm so sorry , Jack . In the future are we together ? We can 't be because one day you 're gonna die and I won 't . Then we forget the future and we make a promise . I 'm sorry , Angelo . This is the story of my life . Captain Harkness , the last mortal man . You 'll want to come with me because I can take you to the one man who knows how the miracle began . - Who 's that ? - Angelo . Angelo Colasanto . They 're with me . They 've agreed to leave their weapons behind . - But Esther 's gonna stay outside . - Why ? What for ? She 's gonna keep an open relay to a hard drive back in Los Angeles . If we go through those doors and disappear , then we have a record . Okay ? So tell your goons to leave her alone . Come on , Angelo 's inside . He talked about you all the time , Jack . His immortal man in old New York . He never forgot . You telling me the whole world got screwed because two gay guys had a hissy fit ? - Rex , get back in your cave . - Come on , give me a break . You inspired him . You proved immortality was possible . And he devoted the rest of his life to finding out how to live forever . And he did it ? He 's still alive ? He 's still young ? Oh yes , he 's still alive . Angelo Colasanto is still very much alive , but he 's not young . My grandfather waited all this time to live forever . And his wish came true ... too late . ( Theme music playing ) ( Beeping ) ♪ Torchwood : Miracle Day 4x08 ♪ End of the Road Original Air Date on August 26 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = What 's wrong with him ? At his age , just about everything . - You can leave us alone , thanks . - Of course , ma 'am . What happened to your eye ? I was just born with it . It 's him . - You must be horrified . - Why would you say that ? He 's grown so old . That 's how I see the whole world . He 's still young compared to me . This is for Esther . Just keeping an open line to make sure we 're all safe . After everything I 've heard about Torchwood technology you 're gonna rely on an open handset ? Yeah well , we had to leave L.A. in a hurry thanks to someone I could mention . Anyway , what the hell 's going on with the stock markets ? They 're falling . It 's been inevitable ever since miracle day , which I reckon is part of the plan . So you put a gun to my daughter 's head for what ? For this ? So you get your revenge on Jack ? We weren 't trying to hurt you . I was carrying out my grandfather 's final wish- to keep you safe . - So you don 't want him dead ? Do you mean you were protecting me ? Hell of a way of going about it . There 's a crucial distinction : My grandfather cared for you , I don 't . You might be important in some way we 've yet to work out . So it 's best to keep you intact . But that 's as far as the sentiment goes . So why the hell , you know- - bollocks . Start again . Any chance of a drink ? I could murder a pint of bitter right now . Thanks , Gwen . I 'll have a vodka . These are all of you . Some of these are- - that 's Torchwood . That 's Cardiff . When was that ? - The ' 70s . - A mustache ? My God , Jack . He watched you for decades . But he never made contact . You may not be ashamed of being old , but he was . Hold on now . He didn 't cause this ? Angelo didn 't cause the miracle ? No , he lived this long through natural means . He kept his body at a temperature 2 ° below normal . He controlled his caloric intake , kept his blood pressure below 110 . - Does that work ? - Oh yes . Prolonging life is simple . But no one 's worked out how to make a profit at it so it 's not advertised . And the whole time he was looking for immortality ? It 's not as impossible as it sounds . You are not the only remarkable thing on this Earth , Jack . Consider the jellyfish . The species turritopsis nutricula is considered to be immortal . Its cells undergo a process called transdifferentiation . Quite simply , it can revert to a younger state , and grow old again . And then repeat without limit . It 's possible there are individual jellyfish upon this planet that have existed for thousands and thousands of years . I 'm not as special as I thought . You never were . Even within the human body , cancer cells are immortal . Stem cells , in theory they can divide forever . And this is the research that Angelo investigated . Well , they all did , because my grandfather wasn 't alone . Who were the others ? Well , the story says that it started with three men , each representing a different family . And when you were being murdered over and over again , these three men came to witness your resurrection . I saw them . They made a deal . They formed an alliance to purchase the power of resurrection . And when you escaped , the three families swore that they 'd find the gift again . What were their names ? The Ablemarch family , the Costerdane family and the Frines . Ablemarch , Costerdane , Frines . Did you get that ? Ablemarch , Costerdane and- is " Coster " with a t-e-r ? - Is " coster " with a t-e-r ? - Yeah , t-e-r . And- - - spell " Frines . " Could you spell Frines ? F-r-i-n-e-s . " F-r-i-n-e-s . " All right , trace ' em . I want you to find every single member of those three families . Rex , this is nine decades later . Look , I don 't care if it 's 500,000 people . I want you to find them all- - now . So what happened then ? 1928- - what did they do next ? They lost Jack , but they still had his blood . No , no , no- - no ! I thought they were draining it away , but they were collecting it . All they had to do was figure out how to use it . But that doesn 't work . There 's nothing special about my blood in itself . That 's not what made me immortal . Then why would the three families want to kill you ? I don 't know . Whatever they were planning , my grandfather wasn 't included . I think they considered him inappropriate . What 's inappropriate ? He loved a man . He did go on to have a family of his own . And I think he loved my grandmother very much , but he never lied about you , Jack . And I think that Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines found that a little unfortunate . As a result , Angelo was forced to watch them from afar . Made enough money by the looks of it . Well , Jack told him enough to navigate his way through the 20th century and make a profit . But what did these families do to the world ? They started in Manhattan . 80 years later the whole of the planet becomes immortal . And I become mortal . In 1998 we intercepted a message . " Blessing . " We 've heard about The Blessing . They found it . Whatever The Blessing is , the three families found it . Now it 's time that we found them . Esther , you got any news for us ? This is plain weird . There 's no one called Ablemarch or Costerdane or Frines . I mean literally there 's no such names . There 's nothing . It 's blank . They don 't exist . Esther ? Esther ? Esther ? I think there 's trouble . How long till Shapiro gets here ? He was out of the airport right behind us . We got maybe five minutes till the rest of the C.I.A. descends . Five minutes should be enough . Bring her . We gotta finish this before the rest of the C.I.A. arrives . - Shit . - What is it , Rex ? What 's happening ? Tell us where we can find the three families quickly . You 'll never find them . That 's the whole point . They came out of New York with the motivation of keeping this secret . Where 's the best place to hide yourself ? In plain sight . - Nobody move ! - This is the C.I.A. Everybody stay where you are . That 's an order . You , with the others . Matheson , don 't try anything . We are arresting all of you for violations of the Miracle Security Act . This is the same as treason now , folks . And I want a word with Rex . - Right now . Secure him . - Who the hell are you ? Don 't move . That 's your last warning . - That 's Brian Friedkin . - Of course it 's Friedkin . If anyone 's working for the three families , it 's him . That 's enough ! Keep him covered . We may have to end this with an unfortunate number of Category 1s . - Get him out . Take him out . - You 're not taking him . - Back down . - No you 're not . - Back down ! - No you 're not . - Back down ! - Okay , all right . - Okay , it 's all right . - They 've just taken Rex . - All right . Okay . - Okay ? - Fine . Right . - They 're not legitimate C.I.A. Done . All right . Go out and keep watch for the squad . Leave me alone with him . This is gonna have to be quick . - Shapiro 's arriving any minute . - Right . Right , I get it . You have to dispose of me before the rest of the C.I.A. comes and finds out what you 're up to . How did you find us ? 10 hours ago Rex made a phone call to the brother of Dr. Vera Juarez expressing his condolences . We 've been tracking his phone ever since . I knew you 'd make a mistake in the end . It 's funny though . I never thought that sympathy would draw you out . But now all I 've got to do is say you attacked me and then I pulled my gun . I wonder which spot is memories or personality . Here , please feel free to piss yourself . Why is Friedkin inside ? Who put him in the field ? Rex Matheson was his division , sir . He feels personally responsible . Yeah well , he should have waited for me , the fat ass . It doesn 't make sense . I mean Rex , he 'd know they 'd be tracing him . - How much did the families pay you ? - It wasn 't about the money . You can 't escape them . The families don 't just pay me . They own me . - Who did that ? - They are everywhere . - They are always . - What 's it doing ? - They are no one . - And they are listening . What ? Oh , Friedkin , I 'm so glad you mentioned money . That 's gonna transmit beautifully . What do you mean transmit ? Transmit from where ? You 're not wearing a wire , we already checked . He stole them . Mr. Shapiro you 've got a confession from Brian Friedkin live on the air . - You 're lying . - Oh yeah ? You know , you should read more . Check the Torchwood file , okay ? I-5 technology transmitting from a contact lens camera ? Yeah , see once my heart rate hits 120 , that 's the signal to transmit the image on every frequency and on every monitor within 100 feet . - You planned this . - Mmm . I used my phone on purpose . I was just waiting until Torchwood got enough information . But then the Colasantos , they showed their hand . So I needed to get back inside , which meant laying a trap for you . It 's over , Friedkin . It 's over . And you 're no killer . Agent Friedkin , show yourself ! - Good job . - Thank you . Very good job . Mr. Shapiro sir , tell me something , all that time I was on the run , did you think I was a traitor ? There was evidence woven through your records going back 10 years or more . Whoever these people are , they 're a lot smarter than Friedkin . And they 're operating on all sorts of different levels . Yeah , but now we 've got them on the run . Maybe . So let 's start from the beginning . Exactly what is going on ? Okay , let 's see where we are . Uh , hold on a minute , mate . Rex , look , I need to know , did you plan this whole thing from the start ? No , I just improvised when these Colasanto people appeared . Okay well , you could have warned us . People seem to be talking over me , which is fascinating and rare and forbidden . I 'll come back to you . First of all we 're gonna deal with this Colasanto woman . The granddaughter Olivia . Have I got that right ? Yes , and as far as I 'm aware , the C.I.A. Does not have the authority to operate on American soil . - Get her out of here . - This is my property . Take her to the safe house . Tell her to line up her lawyers so I can piss on them long and hard . So these are the Torchwood clowns ? Torchwood did more to piece this together than the entire C.I.A. You 're that English girl , Cooper . Have I got that right ? No , I 'm not English and I 'm not a girl . Gwen , this is Allen Shapiro . - Don 't . Really , don 't . - Well , he 's not scaring me . - Hello . - I am sick of her already . Can we deport her ? Let 's deport her . - Hey hey hey , leave her alone . - Don 't you dare . Hold on . Sir , with all due respect , Gwen Cooper has proven herself to be extremely useful . I think it 's worth keeping her on our side . Did you sleep with her ? - Pardon me ? - No sir , I did not . Because most women that bitter you 've slept with . - Did you make that mistake ? - No . No sir , I did not . Esther Drummond . Rex said you did a good job out in the field . Thank you , sir . In my opinion you deserted your post . I 'm docking your pay . And what is it with you , " Red Baron " ? - You got Snoopy up your ass ? - Hee , hee , that 's funny ... While you 're wasting time , Mr. Shapiro , we 've got the names of the people who are responsible for causing the miracle . I suggest we get to work . Torchwood is going to work for the C.I.A. ? I think the C.I.A. can work for Torchwood if you 're lucky . We 've got a plane ready and waiting 20 minutes away . The sooner we pool our resources , the sooner we can end this thing . All right , let 's go . Everybody out . What about him ? We 've got a very sick man here . Didn 't you read the news ? Nobody dies . There 's a nurse around here somewhere . You got two minutes . Don 't leave them alone . Jack , did we just join the C.I.A. ? I think we did . - Hmm . - Hmm . Take that fat ass traitor to the airport and put him in cargo . God help you . The families aren 't kind to people who let them down . I did a lot of good . Sure . All I 'm gonna be remembered for is this . But there were times when I stopped them , when I said no to the families . There were so many times that I said no . I wish I could say no now . What are you doing ? It 's all about the family in the end . They said that they would get mine unless ... - No no no ! - No no , please ! What the hell was that ? - What happened ? - Oh my God . Who was in there ? Friedkin , Colasanto . I don 't know how many others . - God damn it . - Shit . More bloodshed . All these years later and my life hasn 't changed . I can 't believe you were watching me . Maybe you said hello . Some old man asking me directions and I just ... looked right through you . Did you see him ? Did you see Ianto ? You 'd have liked him . Or maybe not . You 'd have been jealous . Got to go . Work to do . I 'll take care of you . I promise . I could travel this whole wide world , but where would I find another man like you ? See you later , old man . What 's the point of that ? He 's sick , I know . Tell me something new . Shut up ! You want to tell whoever made this stuff dying 's not quite the same anymore ? Oh , how do I ... ? That 's better . Kind of cruel though . Angelo . Even if your heart stops , you go on living nowadays . Like I said , I 've got to go . No way . That 's impossible . How the hell did you do this ? I 've got a man dying here ! Do you hear me ? Someone 's dying ! Jack , what 's happening ? He 's dead . He died . Angelo died right in front of me . Just think about it , Jack . He can 't die . Listen to me . This man is dead . We 've got to help him . Then get away from the bed . Clear the area . That 's an order . All right , step back . Clear the bed . We have an emergency . Stand back . You , do what you can . This man is either dying or dead . Look , Jack , just let the medical staff take a look at him , okay ? He can 't be dead , Jack . He just can 't be . That 's impossible . Nobody can die . He 's just Category 1 . I scanned him . He 's gone . But is it everyone ? I mean , did the world just change back ? And if so , what happens to me ? Hmm ? I was supposed to die . You , tell Langley to go online , check the hospitals . Check with everyone , ' cause if he 's dying , then who else is dead ? Matter of fact , just come with me . Excuse me . He 's dead ! How ? Only him , no one else . The only man in the whole wide world to die . The miracle continues minus Mr. Colasanto . So how did he do it ? We 've taken the body for autopsy . - Any idea what we 're gonna find ? - I don 't know . - We should go . - No no no no . Nobody is leaving . This house is secure . - It 's not a crime scene . - You sure about that ? Dying of old age can now be considered a crime . Something happened here and we are going to search this place for every last bit of information . And nobody is going to leave until we know exactly what happened . So you can stay just where you are , Captain . I 'm sorry . Yeah . And you really don 't know what happened to him ? What is it , Jack ? Come on , what 's wrong ? Are we in trouble ? - Yes . - We 're in trouble because he died ? Yeah . But why ? Well , Brian Friedkin is a Category 1 , the economy is going into a freefall and one man died . So how was your day ? Welcome back , Rex . Things were kind of quiet without you . But there 's nothing else happening worldwide . Colasanto is the only death . We 're trying to keep it secret in case it starts a riot . But you 've got the only corpse on planet Earth . Yeah , how do you think it happened ? Was it some kind of drug or something ? - What makes him so different ? - Still waiting for the results . Well , if he found a way to die , then we need to find it- - and quickly . Past two hours , Greece and Ireland have declared bankruptcy , and Spain is going under . They 're gonna take the whole European Union down with them . Okay , let 's investigate this thing from the day it began with the three families . Esther . I 've sent you their names- - Costerdane , Ablemarch , Frines . Problem is I 've looked . There 's no one with these last names . But there has to be . They 're names . - What names aren 't names ? - These names . According to every site I can think of the names didn 't just die out , they never existed . It could be done . It 's happened before . At the end of the second World War all the Hitlers disappeared from the Berlin phone book . Change your name , go back and erase passport records , birth certificates . Do that for decades and you 'd be buried in the fabric of the world . - There 's got to be a paper trail . - Oh , I was born for this . All right , we 've got Manhattan 1928 . Let 's check churches , schools , Western Union . I 'll get the full division on this . If these people bought or sold or joined anything , it 's got to be on paper somewhere . - People always miss something . - All right . Noah , sidebar . I got something for you . Hey , remember the Vivaldi inheritance in 2004 ? Follow that same pathway , 'cause it worked in the end . And then cross-reference it with the word " Blessing . " - Make " Blessing " a filter . - Yup . Hey , I 've gathered some information for you . It 's your sister . Is she all right ? She 's okay . She 's under psych observation . - In the high security wing . - Oh my God . I went ahead and told them you work for the government to get her some extra care , you know ? Thank you . Thanks . Yeah well , don 't tell anyone . Bad for my image . I 'll send you the details . You making a personal call , Drummond ? - No . Sorry , sir . - Is that Mr. Shapiro ? You tell him , " Yes , it 's personal . Yes , it 's important . And yes his wife called . And I sent her flowers on his behalf . " Charlotte Wills . Bane of my life . Try hitting Phicorp with an official disclosure . Oh yeah , and I got one more thing for you- - Oswald Danes . Yeah , we 're eyeballing him now , but not under close surveillance . Why ? Harkness keeps watching him and his instincts are good . He says if we 're watching Danes , then the three families are watching him too . So I want you to get someone in there , okay ? I 'm on it right now . It says here that Oswald sold out Cowboy Stadium . - He 's in Dallas . - He 's playing a stadium ? He 's preaching hellfire and salvation , which makes Oswald Danes the most popular man in the world right now . I 'm trying to set up a joint appearance for you with Madison Weakly . She 's the bisected bride . You know , car accident sheared off everything below the bikini line . Got married a week later propped up on a box . Basically she 's made up of positive thinking and colostomy bags . Anyway , they were thinking you and she could share the spotlight if they could manage a two-shot , obviously . Next I 've got you these essays by John Maynard Keynes . You 've got interviews about fixing the economy tomorrow . Mostly you 'll just call for more deregulation and a resumption of burning . Now we 've got this . It 's a request from Washington to speak to the committee on health and immortality . ♪ Riding down on Sunset , Santa Monica too ... ♪ Oswald ? It 's Washington . ♪ over to the valley to pick up Peggy Sue ... ♪ So what do you think ? Yes or no ? If you turn that down ... ? All right , I 'm going to need a reply by Friday night or they 'll ask someone else . I said they 'll ask someone else . Please , Oswald , I 'm just trying to finish the day . Could you turn the music down ? Get me a girl . How old ? Legal age . Seriously ? I 've made a new life for myself , a new chance with new tastes . So I want a woman . Now get me one . A redhead . ♪ jumping like a Jack-in-the-box ♪ ♪ cruising in the big bowl ♪ ♪ for a burger and some fries ♪ ♪ all the cool cats gather round ♪ ♪ they want to go got a ride ... ♪ - ♪ in a stretch Cadillac ... ♪ - Hi there . I 'm sorry , but you 're Jilly Kitzinger , right ? I 'm sorry . I don 't have time . No here , let me help you with this- - you with all this stuff . I will take this . I will take that . That 's better . So my name is Shawnie Yamaguchi and I 'm on that internship from Harrigan Knights P.R. They said you were so busy and overworked and I figured , well , you know , learn from the best . I don 't need an intern . Thank you . I 'm sure . But this isn 't the latest model . And I can get you the prototype if you want . And you really need to get 4G . I got a contact in the store . And that is an awful lot of reading . And I am free all night . Hmm , Shawnie Yamaguchi ? That is correct . Go get me a sandwich , tomato and Swiss on sourdough . See how well you cope with that . Then you can find me a prostitute . I 'm sorry ? Start with the sandwich . Certainly . I don 't mean to be rude , but I don 't know how you put up with him . Oh . I won 't have to . Not for much longer . I 'm sorry , what do you mean ? Never mind . Off you go . Danes and Kitzinger . Shawnie 's in . Told you I 'd come back , didn 't I ? Just give me till tomorrow and I 'll come see you , okay ? Did you fix things ? You said you were gonna fix them . Not yet . Still trying . Doctor said you 'd been good today . - She sounded nice . - Yeah . She is , yeah . Hey , when I get back we 'll go to the promenade together , just you and me . Would you like that ? I suppose . You know , we keep talking about the miracle like it 's a bad thing , but we forget about the good side- - all the years we 're gonna have together . That 's good , isn 't it ? They said you reported me . Who said that ? Is it true ? I had to ... For your own good . I know . I get that , yeah . That 's why I know you 'll understand . I want to volunteer . - For what ? - Category 1 . Sarah , you can 't volunteer . Category 1 is- - it 's a medical condition . You can 't choose it . People do . Online there 's thousands of us . This whole world 's changed , Esther . This body is without a soul . Don 't say that . What about the girls ? Think about the girls . I 've put them on the list too . Sometimes I wonder what keeps us from falling straight through the Earth to the other side of the world . Oh God . Damn it . - You okay ? - Fine . Time out I think , Drummond . No sir . Not at all . We need to find out how that man died and fix this stinking world . Thank you , sir . I can 't tell you . I don 't trust the phones these days . And we 've got these family people everywhere . And Jack 's just as bad . Honestly , you should see him right now , Rhys . He 's sulking . Why ? What 's he doing now ? Oh , don 't tell me . Did he get another bruise ? - Who 's that ? - Jack , her boss . Well , you tell her for me I had a gun held to my head . My life was in danger and her father 's right inside our own house . And all because of her . So you tell her don 't give up . Go get the bastards , whatever it takes . - Tell her yourself . - No . I 'm watching TV . She says go get ' em . Yeah , I heard . So what about Jack then ? Oh , he 's doing that old thing , keeping secrets . Won 't tell me . Will you ? Hmm ? God knows what 's going on . - What time is it there ? - It 's almost 8 : 00 . The telly 's been on all night . They said there 's gonna be a run on the banks . - Like a Lehman Brothers ' thing . - It 's the pensions . Aye , the pension funds go bankrupt because of the medical . And that sets off a domino effect ' cause everything 's been on a knife edge since 2008 . They said the best advice is to invest in gold . There we are , we 'll be fine . Thank God for my vast reserves , eh ? How 's dad ? She 's asking how dad is . Tell her the truth . Not so good , Gwen . Is he conscious ? Not so much , no . The trouble is we can 't get a doctor in 'cause they 'll classify him Category 1 . And them ovens are still sitting there . They 're only closed 'cause of the protests . And they said on the news if we get a recession , then it 's classic isolation policy . Given our lack of resources the camps will open up again . - Like someone planned it . - Yeah . But does that include 2008 as well ? I mean , you know , was that part of the plan ? A first stage ? Could be . I think we 've been manipulated for decades . Yeah , but what for ? I mean , where 's it all heading ? I don 't know . It 's not like the old days of Torchwood . I mean we knew what we were fighting there . But this ... This is like the whole world is changing and we 're just so tiny . God , I wish you 'd come home . Not yet , sweetheart . But soon . Soon . Okay . What are you doing ? You seen this ? Maybe it 's the floor . What do you mean ? Well , we 're going through evidence like Angelo 's body did something . But the only strange thing with this room is the floor . I knew something was bugging me . Look , the bed 's on a sort of platform . Esther , don 't . Just leave it . But look , it 's not part of the original design . It can 't be . Esther , seriously . Listen to me . Don 't say another word . Just leave it . Jack ? It 's the floor . Esther , stop , right now . This is a hell of a lot better than nicotine gum , let me tell you . You know what the rumor is from Washington ? If cancer cells are immortal , then the miracle switched them around and made them just plain mortal . They 're keeping it quiet in case there 's an outbreak of spontaneous joy . I mean we can 't have that . But it means we 've got nothing to worry about . We can smoke our way into the next Great Depression . Now ... somebody want to tell me what 's going on between you three ? Nothing . I 'm sorry , Jack . But we 're trying to figure out how Angelo Colasanto died . I think there 's something under the floor . Okay , people , thank you very much . Leave the room immediately . Good work . Wait for my call . - Captain Harkness , what is that ? - No idea . Jack , tell us what it is , ' cause if you could hear my sister volunteering to be categorized , you would help . Look , if he says he doesn 't know , he doesn 't know , okay ? I 've read the Torchwood file . Are those materials extraterrestrial ? I said he doesn 't know . Now get out of his face . The file also says that Cooper and Harkness inevitably form an alliance and the best results can be achieved by separating them . Okay , get her out of here . And I mean it this time . Deport her . She 's no longer welcome in the United States . - Get her out of the country . - Don 't touch me . - Leave her alone . - Oh , you have something to say ? Please . No ? Well , I 'm sorry , Miss Cooper , but from this moment on Torchwood is defunct . You will be removed from American soil immediately . And God help Great Britain . With me . Don 't cause trouble . Don 't worry , Jack . I 'll find you , all right ? - Sir , you 've got to reconsider this . - You can 't do this . Then talk . By all means , start talking . The C.I.A. doesn 't have any authority over me . You 're not deporting me ! I 'm coming back ! Still got nothing to say ? Well , then you 're not gonna mind if we dig this thing up - and take it back for analysis . - You can 't . I 'm sorry , okay ? You can 't touch it . Oh , he speaks at last . Jack , come on . What the hell is it ? - Some sort of transmitter . - Okay , what does it do ? Well , it mostly proves my theory that immortality is caused by some kind of morphic field . Wait a minute . You know what 's causing the miracle ? No , saying it 's a morphic field is as vague as saying it 's radiation . I still don 't know how , where or what is creating it . So it transmits what , some sort of field that cancels out the first one so Angelo could die ? - And where did he get it ? - I don 't know everything . How big is this field ? The whole house ? Smaller . About the size of that panel . So we would be able to stop the miracle if we could create a field as big as what , the whole planet ? No , you need a structure like this panel as big as the whole planet . Well , I 'm sure we 'll be able to replicate its effects . Don 't touch it , seriously . That 's a proper null field . You change the dynamic and it could nullify everything , even life . Well , then you need to make it safe . I am not an expert . You 're the closest thing we 've got . Now make it safe . And then we 're gonna take this thing back to Langley . Mr. Danes . My name is Claire . Or whatever you want it to be . Now I did have to adopt a dress code in order to get through hotel security . You know how that is . But I have clothes in my bag if you 'd like . Schoolgirl outfit maybe ? There won 't be any need for that . Okay . Well , it 's not about the clothes anyway . I can act all kinds of innocent . Whatever you want . I was very clear I don 't want that . Not at all . What do you want ? I suppose we could talk a little . - Would you like a drink ? - And then what ? I need to know exactly what we 're doing tonight . Maybe we could have dinner . On room service . I 'm sorry , you mean like a date ? If you want . Mr. Danes , I do know who you are . I mean from your trial . Except that 's not everything that I am . Don 't presume to know me . I am capable of much more than my reputation . So you want to date me ? To begin with . Oh my God . So would that be like your first date ever ? I said don 't presume . We could have a drink . Maybe a fine wine , civilized people , adult company . Actually no . If you don 't mind , I think I 'd like to go . But I do mind . I 'm paying . Mr. Danes , the thing is I could cope with this if it meant shoving my face in the dirt . I 'm used to that . But if you want us to pretend that you 're normal , no way . No . - No no , look ... - Don 't , sir . - Please don 't do that . - All I 'm asking for is your company . That 's all . Just your company . Well , I think I should warn you that girls my age fight back . You know that already though , don 't you ? That 's why you prefer kids in the first place . Stop ! Don 't you dare ! If you want to be a changed man , you 're running out of time . The way I heard it , you 've been classified a Category 0 . What 's Category 0 ? Oh , that day is gonna come . Category 0 is you . What 's Category 0 ? What 's the- - the what ? What 's Category 0 ? And why does my whore know about it ? Ah , clever girl . Well , that 's what you get for employing someone who sleeps with Senators . - She 's been listening . - Tell me , what 's Category 0 ? Look , Oswald , did you really think it would never come to an end , your freedom ? There 's an emergency mandate being passed through Congress defining a new Category 0 , meaning people who have earned themselves a place in the ovens for moral reasons . They want to burn me alive ? Oswald , you were always sentenced to death . What you had was a wonderful delay . And now it 's time for that adventure to come to an end . But- - People love me . Television loves you . It 's a different thing . They can 't kill me . Not yet . - I haven 't found them . - Haven 't found who ? How long have you known about this ? How long have you known ? How long have you known ? Oswald ... I 'll have you arrested for this . Brand new charges ! They 're going to reopen those ovens and you 're going in ! You run , Oswald ! Run as fast as you can ! You 've got the most famous face on the planet . Where are you gonna hide ? Where are you gonna go , Oswald ? What are you gonna do ? Esther , can you come here for a second ? Uh , and Rex . I need you to hold these pattern blocks in place . - All right , which ones ? - There . Put your hands on the panel . Jack , I 'm really sorry about this , but I didn 't know . Yeah , now listen to me quickly . I 've broadened the transmission so it 's nullifying sound waves . No one outside the field can hear us . So make yourself look busy , just stay where you are and no one can hear what we 're saying . What are you talking about ? They 're right there . Hey , you can hear me , right ? Hey ! Would you turn around and not look at him ? They can 't hear us ? It 's a null field . No , no way . Rex , don 't attract attention . All right . Esther , I want you to count to 100 out loud . All right ? Just keep counting . Go ahead , go . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight ... Excuse me . Sorry about that . Just check that medical record , okay ? ... 30 , 31 , 32- - Holy shit . This is insane . They can still see us . Keep your heads down facing away like you 're concentrating , okay ? This thing is real . How does it work ? I can 't tell you . That 's the point . Just listen to me . I knew this stuff the second I saw it . Yes , it 's alien technology . The only examples of it on Earth were in the Torchwood hub . They were buried in the ruins . But Angelo had people watching . He must have salvaged it knowing the miracle was coming . So what did he do ? Trigger it with your D.N.A. or something ? Maybe that was revenge or maybe giving me a clue . But there 's only one course of action left now . You have to get me out of here . - Are you crazy ? - Turn your head . Jack , listen to me . The C.I.A. is not the enemy . That 's why I brought them in . Don 't you understand ? - You don 't- - - Keep your head down . Be calm ... Look , you don 't need to run anymore , okay ? We can protect you . There 's a reason why Torchwood was secret . We kept things hidden from the human race . This technology is a science the world should never know . How can you know that ? I know , Esther , because I 've seen the future . I 've walked the future world and breathed its air . And this technology would send it to damnation . Just imagine the stealth technology of a null field hiding bombs , hiding planes , shielding one side from radiation while the other side burns . This thing would be the end of us . This timeline would be terminal . He 's right . Whose side are you on ? Even if the government- - even if the government had this one panel and they put people inside and they died , it 's the same thing as the ovens . It 's control over life and death and we 've seen that that doesn 't work . But you trust me , don 't you ? Both of you ? After all we 've done ? Please , I 'm begging you , get me out of here . Look , this is the Alpha plate . Without it this is just a bunch of metal . You 've got to get me and the plate away from this house . Jack , listen to me . We can 't , okay ? We are the C.I.A. and this is a genuine C.I.A. operation . This is history , Rex . This is everything . Please , get me out . I think you should call the police . This is bigger than the police . I 'm organizing a press conference . I 'm gonna say that Oswald Danes is on the run with all his old appetites . It 's gonna be the biggest witch hunt this country 's ever seen . Oh , um ... Shawnie , can you give us a second ? This is a friend of mine . - I think . - All right . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm here to warn you . You 're being watched by a C.I.A. field agent . Me ? Don 't be ridiculous . Oh ! And secondly , you 're being considered for a promotion . - You just shot her . - Does a promotion sound interesting ? - She was C.I.A. ? - I need you to focus , Miss Kitzinger . How would you react to a promotion ? - With Phicorp ? - Oh , we 're way above Phicorp . - Who are you ? - We 're family business . Interested ? Yes . Yes . Well , then that completes the interview . - And we 'd better leave . - Where are we going ? A long way away . I have her . She 's with us now . Thanks . Good news . Catholic churches love records . There 's tons of this stuff . Sorry , am I interrupting ? Oh no , it was just a family thing , that 's all . All right , let 's get started . The whole world is depending on us . Hey , Jack , Shapiro wants to see you . Yeah . Wait a minute . You might want to grab your coat . - He 's outside by the forensics vehicle . - Thanks . - Thank you . - Yeah , just shut up . Now listen , this is the story . Jack knocked him out , held us at gunpoint and stole a car , okay ? All right , come on . - You 're not coming with me ? - We can 't . That 's why we 've got to keep our faces out of this . I 'm sorry , Jack . But the C.I.A. has a chance of solving this thing now . They need me and Esther . We can help . There 's a courtyard this way . All right , now listen . There 's gonna be a guard on the gate . I 'll tell him that Shapiro authorized a car . Just keep your head down . - Go go go . - Which one is it ? I don 't know . They 're all the same . Just chirp the thing . Hey , stop ! I said stop . Jack ! Stay where you are . He saw me . - Rex , he saw me . - Come on , Jack . - Rex , he saw me . - I know . You can 't stay . You definitely cannot stay . Someone 's gonna have to go with him . Jack , get in there . - Come with us . - I can 't . - Look after him , Esther . - My sister . I know , but someone will have heard that shot . Now go . - Rex , you 've got blood . - It 's my heart . You just go . It 's my heart . Go ! Go ! It 's morning in America . It 's morning across the western world and the banks are closing down . It 's a disaster of almost biblical proportions . Jack , you still with me ? Some say the concept of money itself is under threat . The euro has exacerbated the financial crisis ... Jack ? Can you hear me ? ... Encouraging some countries to behave as recklessly as the banks themselves ... Oh my God , I don 't know where to go . Jack , please . Please say something . Oh my God , I don 't know what to do . Jack . Oh my God . I don 't know what to do . ( Theme music playing ) = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

 Hey , potter ! I scored us a buck ! Half of it 's for you ! Don 't come any closer , jed . Jenny 's got it - - the red flu . Stumbled over a dead body by canyon creek . She didn 't see the " x . " I 'm not gonna let you starve ! I 'm leaving you the buck ! [ spray can rattling , lid pops ] [ thud ] [ sighs ] Grandpa , what 'd you get ? Game was a little scarce today , kiddo . Plainview is a full day 's hike , but a total score . Fully stocked and completely deserted . Oh , I love these ! Let 's put everything away in the pantry . Perishables in front , canned goods in back . And those are for breakfast . You shouldn 't be going so far out there by yourself . I think I saw an electronics store there . I could go back tomorrow and get you that part you need . What is it , a vacuum tube ? You 're not going . It 's our only chance of getting ahold of tom . He 's your son . If anyone can survive , it 's him . It 's a capacitor , not a vacuum tube . And bring a weapon . Yes , sir . Jeter : The ceremony will be at 0900 . We 'll have seven gunners and the ensigns at half-mast . It 'll be a hero 's farewell . He wanted to redeem himself . He never had to . He gave his life for mine . He gave his life for the mission . And now we 're free ... To finish it . [ whir , hiss ] Congratulations , little guy . Your job here 's done . Rachel : I could actually do with some help with these boxes . You can set them up over there . Thank you . At your service . Little more room between those cots , please . So , uh ... The peeps are asking . What 's this whole Human guinea pig thing gonna look like ? I mean , basically , you infect the crew with the virus , You see what happens ? Well , not the entire crew . Six individuals of varying blood and genetic markers . First we administer the vaccine prototype , Then we inject each of them with the virus . Ah , gotta tell you ... I don 't know if people are gonna be lining up for that . Well , that 's not my department . [ clattering ] [ clicks tongue ] Mason : This is the last one we recorded . [ click , radio static ] Dominic : Hello ? Is anyone listening ? My name is dominic . We 're stranded on a boat west of the island of jamaica . There are 50 of us . Many are sick . We need help . Turn it off . Anyone . Please . [ click ] I thought I wanted to hear his voice again , But not like that . It must have been so hard Listening to all of that suffering . Are you sure that you want to be there ? To watch the trials ? It 'll be part of my blood flowing through those people . I have to see if it 's going to work . [ clangs ] Ready ... [ rifles cock ] Aim ... Fire ! [ gunshots ] Ready ... [ rifles cock ] Aim ... Fire ! [ gunshots ] [ rifles cock ] Fire ! [ gunshots ] [ splash ] Chandler : How are we gonna ask them to do this ? We don 't have the time or resources To recruit from anywhere else . I know , but six people ? She doesn 't have the equipment to sustain a quarantine For more than a few days , Which is just enough time for one trial With as many people as she can fit into that lab . Well , then I have to volunteer . We just risked everything to save your sorry ass So that you could lead . What kind of message does that send ? You got rank , you can sit it out ? Everyone else can be the guinea pigs ? Captain 's right . Someone from a leadership position Needs to volunteer to set an example ... Which is why I already had dr . Scott do a work-up on me . Apparently I check off a few of the boxes she needs - - African-american , male over 40 ... Southern baptist . Master chief . With all due respect , gentlemen , it 's already been done . And you don 't even know if you qualify . The crew needs you , In some ways , more than either one of us . I appreciate the sentiment , sir , But you both know we 're all needed . And we 're all dispensable . All right , spread the word we need volunteers . Let the crew know it 'll be completely confidential . I don 't want anyone feeling pressured . Aye , sir . Told you god put me here for a reason . Maybe this is it . Let 's just line ' em up over here . Thanks . Kelly : Hello , captain . You seem to be settling in well . Well , I thought I 'd make myself useful . How 's ava ? She 's doing okay . Thank you . Man : I need two chairs around these tables And the medical questionnaires . I ... I haven 't had the opportunity to thank you For what you did for my family ... After what I did to you . Commander slattery said you were very helpful While I was on vacation . Still ... I don 't deserve what you did . Let 's finish what we started . [ chittering ] Any history of serious injuries ? No , sir . Never even broken a bone . Any flu-like symptoms ? Aches or pains ? Just aching to do my part . [ indistinct conversations ] I never expected this many . Do you really think you qualify to volunteer When you barely survived dengue fever last week ? You 're not even gonna test my blood ? [ door opens ] danny . Tex : Hey ! I 'm looking for the copacabana . Anyone point me in the right direction ? Harvest queen 2008 ? You never told me you were royalty . [ chuckles ] Dr. Scott says we might be in there a few days , So we should grab anything important . I think she wants us to have something sentimental In case it goes south . You 're gonna introduce me to her one day . Thank you . For not trying to talk me out of this . Mm . Rachel : So you 've just received What we 're calling the prototype decoy . It will , uh , bind to the virus and keep it occupied While your system creates the antibodies That it needs to defeat it . I will remind you that you will likely experience Some side effects similar to the early stages of the virus , So ... Some headaches and fever and exhaustion . Just like a good hangover . Ladies and gentlemen , your entertainment For the next three days . [ chuckling ] Um ... I would just like to say that ... You are all - - You 're remarkable people . And ... It is an honor to - - It 's an honor . [ inhales sharply ] well , I 'll see you in there . [ clattering ] [ clattering ] Man : Stop right there ! Stay where you are ! I need olympia . Please . Please . Help me . Don 't come any closer . I need olympia . Please help . Please . Stop right there . Please . I need olympia . Olympia can 't help you . Please ! [ gunshots ] [ thuds ] [ gasping ] Anyone in here ? ! Anyone in here ? ! Show yourself immediately ! What the hell ? ! I thought you said this area was clear ! It was . I don 't know how the hell she got through , man . Damn it , we need to tighten the perimeter . Give me that . We 'll check again . Man : All right , you men , spread out ! I 'll meet you on the other side of the street ! [ spray can hisses ] Man : ♪ celebrate your leaving with a song ♪ [ reggae music playing ] This one 's for you , bertrise . ♪ that 's home to me ♪ ♪ where the living 's irie ♪ ♪ at the rainbow 's reach ♪ ♪ on the day you get back ♪ You know , I still remember the first time you examined me . Well , that might just be because it was only Three weeks ago , and thankfully , You do not have alzheimer 's . Oh . [ chuckles ] that 's some good news . [ breathes sharply ] Family heirloom ? Just something to keep my hands busy . Man of mystery . That 's a conversation for another day . Over ... What , martinis , maybe ? Let me guess . Shaken , not stirred . [ as sean connery 's james bond ] precisely , moneypenny . [ laughing ] [ normal voice ] oh , she hated that . Whoa . You might actually be getting under her skin . In a good way ? Hard to tell . [ chuckles ] yeah . [ chuckles ] Old e-mails ... From my boyfriend . [ cuff pumping ] mickey , right ? That night at the vigil , you talked about him . Were you together a long time ? Uh , about a year ... If you count all the time we were at sea . [ velcro tears ] systolic 120 . All good . Thanks . I hope he treated you right . I , uh ... I 'm an only child , And my parents died on 9 / 11 . He 's kind of the only person who ... Might even be missing me . It reminds me of when sam was born . He was a preemie , right ? Five weeks in the n.I.C.U. All I could do was stand there , helpless . Is that your daughter ? Lily . It was her birthday last month . She 'd be 11 . Do you have children ? No . I never quite found the time for that somehow . Better not to have a child Than to not be there when they need you . Well , if this all goes as it should , You 'll be back with her in a week or so . Oh , we 'll be back . No doubt about that . Uh-huh . Right . Thanks . So far , so good . That 's the word . Can 't believe this could really be it . Going home with a vaccine . Any idea what the plan would be for mass production ? I heard talk about the c.D.C. Nah , it 's too far inland . Captain 's thinking fort detrick - - U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. The question is whether or not they have any power . We could rig something to siphon off from the - - Hey . Let 's not jinx this , okay ? It 's only been six hours . [ silverware clinking ] Woman in distance : Yeah , come on . [ dishes clatter ] [ equipment beeping steadily ] How am I doing ? You 're fine . The fever 's your body 's way Of working to adjust to the treatment . Hey . When lily was a baby , Her temperature would run 102 every time she got her shots . My throat 's sore . Is yours ? [ swallows ] no . [ weakly ] but I feel like I can 't lift my arm . I 'm so tired . Everything all right , master chief ? I 'm fine , but ... Commander garnett looks like she 's burning up over here . You should spend a little more time In the engine room , master chief . Everyone 's body reacts differently . It 's as we predicted . Hey . Come on , doc . That is way below your pay grade . I got that . Oh , no , tex , that 's really not necessary . Trust me , I can handle it . Hi . My name is tex . I 'll be your server this evening . To start with , this fine cocktail of h2o Served straight up for your dining pleasure . Master chief . Thanks . Garnett : What a gentleman . Hello . [ giggles ] Never got a chance to tell ya . It was a nice eulogy for cossetti . I don 't want any more funerals , mike . I think she 's got everything in hand . You were right about her . [ chuckles ] How you doing there , sugar ? Good . Good . I 'm okay . I 'm seeing a future with the doc , Even if it is just carrying her water . [ exhales ] Hey , come on , girl . Kara . Kara . Kara . Doc ! We got a problem ! Kara . Kara ! Kara ! Kara ! She 's not responding . Resps 32 , heart rate 120 . Kara , it 's rachel . Can you tell me how you 're doing ? Kara ? All right , she 's seizing . Give me some room . Rachel : Intramuscular valium in . Give me fresh vitals . Quincy : Seizure is at the 3-minute mark . She 's febrile to 104 . How 's that line coming , doc ? I 'm working on it . Work faster or give it I.M. Valium 's not working . I 'm in . 60 milligrams ketorolac , I.V. Push . 3 minutes , 30 . Pulse ox is down 82 % . We 've got to lower her core temperature . I need ice ! [ equipment beeping rapidly ] Get me an n.G. Tube . Approaching four minutes . [ panting ] I got the ice ! Pour the water over the ice and bring it here . All right . [ gasps ] [ clicking ] [ rapid beeping ] 103 . [ beeping continues ] 102 and dropping . [ breathes deeply ] [ device clicks ] everything 's all right . It was just the fever . [ beeping steadies ] [ breathing heavily ] Thank you , bertrise . I 'll show you how to decontaminate Your clothes on the way out . A 104 degree fever can 't be from the prototype . So what does that mean ? Is it the virus ? It 's possible we didn 't build a strong enough copy Of bertrise 's receptors . The decoys could be breaking down . We checked it a dozen times . We must have missed something in her medical history . Repeat c.B.C. And lytes on everyone . Add on l.F.T.S and endocrine panels . That should tell us more than their blood work . [ lowered voice ] he doesn 't seem convinced . [ lowered voice ] in fairness to quincy , he hasn 't been here . Is there anything you can give the others To help reduce the symptoms ? [ normal voice ] quincy , give them 80 micrograms of interferon . Right . That should pump up their immune systems ... Just in case . [ woman speaking indistinctly over p.A. ] [ sighs ] Dude , you 're exhausted . Let 's just call it right here . I can 't . [ huffs ] I can 't . [ exhales ] I don 't know what I 'll do if anything happens to her . Open . [ light clicks ] He went in after her . What ? My father . He was a firefighter . He went into the north tower . Jesus . You trying to cheer me up ? [ breathes deeply ] anyway ... That 's why I signed up for the navy . Lieutenant chung said you 'd want to see The latest engineering report . What can I say , doc ? I 'm a workaholic . [ laughs ] [ exhales ] ooh , my fingers . [ inhales sharply ] I can 't feel ... Rub your fingers together . It will help the circulation . Tex , let 's lift up your shirt . Garnett 's lost blood flow to her fingers . She 's hypotensive . I 'll get the saline . This rash - - You have any idea when it started ? [ breathing unevenly ] no . It doesn 't itch . All right , well , you let me know if that changes . Yeah . See if you can get some rest . Okay . [ light clicks ] [ exhales sharply ] [ typing ] I think you need to consider the possibility That the decoys aren 't working . [ continues typing ] We 've never seen the virus behave this way . But we haven 't been in the field With the virus for a very long time . We can 't know how the symptoms might have evolved .

I want to see my - - master chief ! Sedative ! I want to come with you now ! Master chief ! Sedative ! No , where are my girls ? Master chief - - look at me , russ . Look at me .

It 's all right . Holy shit , did you see that ? Maya ? Maya ? Doc ? ! Hey , doc ! [ voice breaks ] no . Woman : Significant progress has been made In treating the red flu . If you feel any symptoms , come to olympia . We can help . You are not alone . Significant progress has been made in treating the red flu . [ pops , crackles ] oh ! Damn it . [ sighs ] Do you think they really had a treatment ? At olympia ? Remember when this whole thing started ? People were hoarding apple cider vinegar . Then they told us to rush to the hot springs 'cause that 's a sure-fire cure . And now it 's olympia , whatever that is . Somebody 's got to be making progress somewhere . It 's not true what you said - - That no one would miss you . I will . I 'll make arrangements for the service . I want her given the navy cross . [ breathing heavily , sniffles ] [ inhales sharply ] [ exhales , breathing heavily ] So these aren 't side effects from the vaccine . It is the virus . You 're certain ? Yes . No , he can 't be . Maya died from a heart attack , Which is not a symptom of the virus . But liver failure is , And that 's what caused her blood pressure to drop . The fevers , the delirium , the hemorrhaging . There is no other explanation . There is one . We just haven 't found it yet . No - - whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's your solution ? I.V.I.G. Passive immunization . It could kill her . Chandler : Kill who ? Bertrise . He wants to use the plasma from her blood And inject it directly into the patients . To give them her antibodies . No , quincy ! The amount of blood that we 'd need to take from bertrise - - I am not willing to risk her life ! Well , I 'm not gonna sit here and watch them die . You are too important , bertrise . And if it 's not the virus that 's causing this , It won 't make the slightest bit of difference . But if it is the virus , we can save them . We can manage it . If there 's a chance , we have to take it . I 'm willing , dr . Scott . I am . How are you feeling ? Just a little tired . All right , take a sip of this . I 've got kara 's test results . Captain . I wasn 't sure it was my place to tell you , But if it were me , I 'd want to know . [ exhales deeply ] Kara 's pregnant . [ labored breathing ] [ whimpers ] Hey . [ exhales ] [ whispers ] hi , sweetheart . [ weakly ] danny ? Captain said we could have a visit . That can 't be good news . Don 't you dare leave me . [ crying ] [ gasps softly ] Brief the crew . Anyone who wants a visit , now 's the time . [ door opens , closes ] [ crying ] Quincy : Rachel ? [ breathing heavily ] I just needed somewhere to clear my head . You were right . The I.V.I.G. Hasn 't worked . Their symptoms - - they 're getting even worse . And bertrise ? Dr. Rios is pumping her full of saline and f.F.P. She 'll be all right . Who did I think I was ... That I could solve this ? You 're the best there is . [ exhales sharply ] Yet I 've failed . Come on . We 'll find another way . God ... [ sniffles , sighs ] [ chittering ] Why did it work on you ? We never should have let this happen . Wasn 't anything anybody could have done any differently . I 'm here to see kara . Six people , mike . Six . Can you hear me , buddy ? [ whooshing , steady beeping ] Can you hear us a-at all ? Come on , miller . We still need you , man . Chung : You , uh ... You gotta stick around , ma 'am . You know I can 't be chief engineer . Cheng chung ? Come on . [ chuckles ] [ pumping ] Tex : [ exhales ] [ sighs ] When they tell the story About the great plague of the 21st century , They 'll talk about you . The six . [ door opens ] rachel : Quincy ! Microcellular inflammation , Oxidative stress , immune vascular dysfunction . And bertrise - - always sick when she was a kid And yet immune to this . How could I have missed it ? Can 't say that I 'm following you . What we 're seeing is an autoimmune response - - The rashes , the liver failure , the poor circulation . What happened to maya was her own body attacking itself . The virus is adapting . Once it attached to the decoy , it changed shape . It exposed its human gene . Niels ' gene . And that signaled to their immune systems To launch an attack on every cell in their body . The monkey doesn 't have any human genes , So it didn 't have the same reaction . So how do you stop it ? It need to modify the decoy and hide niels ' gene . If our immune systems can 't see it , it won 't react . No , no , no . There is no way to get their bodies To manufacture the modified decoy on their own . Yes , there is . We use the arctic strain as a trojan horse . [ bubbling ] [ clatters ] You 're gonna be okay , buddy . We got this . It didn 't work , did it ? Take a look . I was thinking it might be high time for the samba . Tex . The merengue ? In bed . Now . Oh , I thought she 'd never ask . [ laughter ] Hey , and ? Put that down , relax . No , sir . [ exhales ] I told you . Yes , you did . Dr. Scott ? The baby ? Will be born immune . [ chuckles ] Jeter : It was touch and go there for a while . [ whispers ] hey , how 's it goin ' ? [ laughs , crying ] [ liquid sloshes ] [ sighs ] Can we talk ... About what I hope ... Is going on in there ? [ slosh ] [ sighs ] We have it . We have a vaccine . We don 't just have ... A vaccine . We have ... The cure . You mean ... I mean that we can save people Who are already sick . [ sniffles ] [ gasps , sighs ] [ gasping ] [ laughs ] [ sniffles , laughs ] [ exhales sharply ] [ water pouring ] Sam : Grandpa , what do you think ? Looking good , kiddo . Don 't forget the " 151 " on the hull . [ faucet turns off ] Thank you . [ radio static ] mm ! Mm ! Both : [ laugh ] Uh ... Uh ... Hey , eat . This is w6abh . Oh ...

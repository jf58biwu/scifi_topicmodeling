The great master who resurrected us , Dr. Akunomiya ! Sigma ! Sigma ! Sigma ! In order to destroy this detestable world ... we must complete Jumbo Mecha quickly . For this , what is needed ? Apache Drill ! The DNA of , people ! Why ? Burner ! To form the organs of Jumbo Mecha . Can DNA be from just anyone ? Baron Eye-patch ! Well , you see ... Growing numb ... Miss Borg . The DNA extracted from Minister Yonekura . How much value does it possess ? Let me combine it with the new Daimonium material . Now , DNA , become the ﬂesh of Jumbo Mecha ! A pinky ... It seems he was worth but a pinky . I am deeply sorry , Dr. Akunomiya . Bimbo ! What the hell ? ! Miss Borg , no matter how masculine you seem , you 're erratic . Since ceasing being human , we 've hated women ! They are full of themselves and can 't plan strategy . Why you ... Lame bitch machine . Dimwits ! Stop quarreling ! I don 't want to watch this . Perhaps you 've forgotten ... why it is I revived all of you and made you into ... cyborgs . Sir . We died because we were betrayed by humans . We want revenge . We want to see their destruction with our own eyes . Then , go out and get better DNA . But to do so ... there 's a bug that needs squashing . Zaborgar . Well , Zaborgar ? Are those claps forced ? Sony . Great reﬂexes , Daimon . Captain Nitta I just wanted to test the skill of the secret police . Are you following me ? We need your help , Daimon . But , observing you ... you seem driven more by personal anger than by duty . I only wish to protect people from Sigma 's evil . That 's all . You know I want to remain your confidant . But , you 're young . I fear you will lose control . Lose control ? I don 't follow . Let 's go , Zaborgar . It 's true . My resentment toward Sigma is for personal reasons . I want revenge for my father , killed by Sigma . He was a scientist who won a Nobel Prize for his robot research . I was one of twin brothers . My mother died upon delivery and we were raised by a single parent . Wonderful . My father was obsessed with Daimonium . A substance that changes anything into a robot . Still , he tried his best to raise us . Come on . That 's the spot . Instead of mother ... he fed us the milk of his breast . It 's unclear if man-breast milk was the cause ... but my brother got sick and died while father focused on his research . It 's hard to fathom now how deep his sorrow went . He continued his research and began developing a robot . Father ! Father ! I won a black belt in the karate tournament ! Shut up ! Don 't interrupt my work . I worked hard to please you . Aren 't you happy ? I 've no time for you . Go to your room and snack on something ! You never care what I do . If you love research so much , why don 't you bring my dead brother back ! What 's that ? Why did you have me ? Loser ! To escape my loneliness , I ran away from home . For ten long years I dedicated myself to karate . Flying Dragon Triple Kick ! Lax ! You 're too self-indulgent . I was self-indulgent . Because , Sigma was targeting my father . Where am I ? What do you want ? We want Daimonium . Dr. Daimon . When we worked together , I always admired your ... scientific ability . Akunomiya ! I 'd rather be humiliated by big , ugly men ... than give my Daimonium to you . If you insist ... I 'll turn you into a machine . No way ! You smell like oil ! You really are going to humiliate me ! Not there . No ! Don 't pinch me there . Not there ! Hey , Daimon . Isn 't that your dad ? Someone ... Help me ! Father ! As you can see ... I am in a most critical situation . But I will not fall into evil hands ! Thus , I have no choice ! He jumped ! That was not very adult of him . Father ! Never forgive . My father was mercilessly killed . I went back to his laboratory to clean up his stuff . Hey , Yutaka . Don 't be a whiner forever . Father ! Yutaka . No matter what ... you must stop Sigma . But how ? I 'll tell you . Behold ! A robot ? It 's Zaborgar ! It employs your brothel 's DNA as a locomotive . You could say that the two of you are brothers . Brothers . I see ... You 've been immersed in research all this time for me . For me ... Listen up , Yutaka . You hold on to what you believe is righteousness . With Zaborgar . Daimon , Minister Wakasugi was abducted again . Into action , now ! Sigma 's on the move . Zaborgar . Helicat ! Change , Machine Zaborgar . Helicat , did you find the car ? That 's Sigma 's car . Miss Borg . Helicat , do not lose that car They will not escape ! What 's that helicopter ? You scamper like a roach , Daimon . Okay , you got us . What are you going to do ? It 's your fault meeting in secret with your mistress . Will they torture me ? Minister Wakasugi . I captured you as you 're in the running for prime minister . To regain my pride , I need your DNA . Diarrhea Robot . Acid spewing Diarrhea Robot . Have them for supper . Yes . Hold it ! Listen ! She 's a former Miss Universe . Even went to graduate school . Eat hell You 're cruel ! Shut up ! Release me this instant ! I 'll give you money . Take hell Let me go . What are you doing ? I hate men who think only of themselves . I don 't want your DNA anymore . I 'd rather see you dead ! I 'll shoot you ! Wait ! Change , Zaborgar . Damn you , Daimon . Diarrhea Robot , go ! Is everything okay ? Sigma , you must not kill people . Over here ! We won 't last long . Zaborgar , Muay Thai Kung Fu . Zaborgar , hang in there . No way ! Diarrhea Robot , give Zaborgar an acid bath ! What is that liquid ? Serves you right ! Cover him with more . No good . Zaborgar will melt . Got you , Daimon . Once in my grip ... you 're a goner ! Flame on ! Too hot ! Why you scum ! Miss Borg . You can 't cheat us like this . The credit will be ours . Come out , King Africa . Show them your power . What are you ? What in the ? Getting closer ! What to do ? Let me go ! Mr. Wakasugi . Are you okay ? Help ! What is that ? A bulldog ? It can 't be . Meet truck-spawned cyborg : Bulldog Car Robot ! Bulldog . Bulldog . Attack ! Bulldog . You won 't ditch me , will you ? You are mine . Here you go ! Coward . You men are all sniveling cowards . Feisty bitch ! Bulldog Car Robot . Attack Miss Borg . You have the best body but the worst heart . Self-centered narcissist . No ! Too close . Zaborgar . Petit Car . It burns ! We 're melting . Zaborgar . Blinding Karate Punch ! Boomerang Cutter . Zaborgar . We did it . Can 't hold on ! Grab on ! Don 't let go of my hand . You show mercy to your enemy . Stupid man . It is not stupid . When one believes in righteousness , one never leaves someone to die . What about Wakasugi ? Him too . But you 're in more danger than he . So ... there are men of honor . Zaborgar . Go . You won 't get past us . Come on . Flying Dragon Triple Kick ! Zaborgar ! Zaborgar , target the red light . Rapid Destruct-Gun ! Help ! Zaborgar . You did it . Daimon . Great job . Zaborgar is something else . Yes . Untie me . That hurts . Just untie me . What in the hell are you police doing ? That 's twice you 've put me in danger ! Sir , I 'm responsible for these incidents . I should be the one reprimanded . Captain ! No . The one who needs reprimanding is the guy in jeans ! I heard he has special abilities , so I ... endowed the secret police with a large budget . So what are these ? I could not save the lady . It was my fault . Idiot ! Don 't ever mention that woman . I was alone at the time . Minister , you pushed her on purpose , did you not ? Daimon . What did you say ? You let her die because it was convenient for you , no ? Stop . You preaching me ? I could squash you with just one finger . What ! How can someone poised to lead Japan be such a coward ! ? What ? Justice strikes ! It 's people like you who are ruining Japan . Don 't stop me . That 's enough . Calm down ! It was sickening seeing you falter under Daimon 's charms . I was watching from above . On the monitor . You 're wrong . I didn 't falter . You ... You were made from the DNA of a dead woman dumped by a man . I felt pity and revived you . Without me ... you wouldn 't exist . I 'm thankful you made me into a cyborg ... But , this body is too tough . How about this ? Huh ? You are now the guy who dumped you ! I don 't want his face . I 'll awaken your deepest trauma . This is awful ! Next ! One month probation . I can 't believe that bastard runs things . Don 't worry about probation . I get it all the time . Our job is to protect the people and the law . It doesn 't matter who or what kind we protect . But ... How old are you ? 22 . The justice you perceive is only in your mind . It 's not as simple as drawing a line . Sigma 's primary objective is destruction . But they are still in the preliminary stage . By protecting our leader , you protect all the people . You mean I have to keep bowing my head to Wakasugi ? No way ! Well , well , well . Don 't sweat it . Daimon is depressed . Just to learn this was worth tailing him . Zaborgar . You are the only one on my side . Even though you are just a machine , I feel a blood bond . If you agree , punch me and cheer me up . Zaborgar . Punch on . No ! Hit me until I bleed . I want to feel the bond ! That 's the way , Zaborgar . More ! More ! That 's it ! More ! More ! I hadn 't cried like that in a long time . With him , I would ride the bullet train to hell . Father . I am no longer sure what it means to fight for righteousness . Daimon , I figured you 'd be here . Can 't forget his breast-feeding ? Miss Borg . What is that odd motorcycle ? It 's the merciless , female motorcycle Black Hawk ! I despise the pity shown me . I 'm here to fight ! I help you and you resent it ? You 're warped . You rub me the wrong way . Change . Black Hawk . Go . Change . Zaborgar . Go . Get them ! Take these ! Holy crap ! On my ! Pervert ! Come Daimon . Just try your favorite karate pose now . No . It 's wrong for men to hit women . Don 't you know that treating me like a woman makes it even worse . Take this ! OK ! What ? Why didn 't you move ? You said " take this . " I took it . What ! Oh dear ... No. no , no , no . This is it ! Hands off , stupid robot . Let 's go . Miss Borg . Sorry about that . It was an accident . Why apologize ? You 're naive and reckless . Please don 't attack our leaders anymore . As you believe in yourself , I 'm only going my own way . Is it really the right thing you do ? If you were born on my side , we could befriends . Why ? I think we have something in common . Hazy recollections of not fitting in . Weird ... I was feeling the same thing . Really ! We should make a toast with juice or something . What 's a toast ? By human standards , is it something like this ? Daimon . I want to feel you with my robot skin . Daimon . Me too . It 's my first time , but I 'm up for it . Awesome ! Pulled together by some invisible force , we felt desire for each other . Human and cyborg ... we were never meant to be together . We certainly knew we were crossing a forbidden line . But we couldn 't stop . Daimon . Yeah ? Tomorrow I will eliminate all the politicians running for prime minister . Wakasugi too . Are you serious ? Which side are you on , Wakasugi 's or mine ? I ... What 's with that look ? Do you despise me ? Is it possible ? Miss Borg . How 's your new plan going ? Going well . I smell a strong human odor emanating from your body . What do you suppose it means ? We were created to assist Miss Borg and her plan . Miss Ruggers . A mouse could not escape our scrum . However , should you hesitate Ow ! We will become your enemy ... and crush you to death ! What ? Just fulfill your mission . Destroying the world is enjoyable ... but being jealous is equally so . Wakasugi 's car has entered an odd building . What are they planning ? Zaborgar . Helicat . Peek into the car window . Who are those people ? What 's that case ? Helicat , zoom in ! Money . What is he plotting ? Daimon . You 're supposed to be on probation . Captain , Wakasugi is involved in corruption . He 's plotting with sketchy people . We should investigate this now . That would be tough . Why ? It 's an order from above . What ? Wakasugi will win the election and become prime minister . The government has decided it . It 's a sad thing . You 're just going to ... I 'm here to protect . What the ? Sorry , but I have a wife and daughter . I cannot lose my job or my family . You idiot . Is this righteousness ? Those were handcuffs ! Daimon . Don 't be stupid . Daimon . I must carry out my plan . Don 't . I can 't sit back idly . Don 't do wrong anymore . It 's not wrong . It 's my lifework . We love each other . Isn 't that enough ? Daimon . Women can 't realize love until we ruin those around us . I cant handle anything that abstract right now . I 'll start . Hold on , please ! 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ... Wakasugi ... Whenever he 's around , the Diet is so stiﬂing . I wish the Diet would be invaded girls in string bikinis . What is that pervert yapping about ? Bikini girls ? Right . Minister ! What ! Bikini ? Here you go . Dragon . Dinosaur Army ! What 's this ? We 're taking off ! Move it . You guys with your hands on your head ... walk in a circle like dogs . No way . I 'm a minister . Shut up ! In a circle ! We have arrived , sister . Let 's take them to Castle Sigma and extract their DNA . Down on your knees . Daimon . We must kill the enemy , sisters . Miss Borg , don 't do this ! Damn it ! Daimon ! Miss Borg . I must save these people . Not you again . This makes the third time I was abducted . This is crap ! Why haven 't you stopped Sigma ? You are the one who put me on probation . To be honest , I just want you gone . You are clueless ! Daimon . Akunomiya . Finally , you realize the contradiction of justice . I was once an earnest scientist . 10 years ago , the government had me build a secret weapon . The experiment failed . To hide their failure , they tried to kill me . The result was this . After that , I believed no one . I swore to destroy the world . Daimon . You are in a similar situation . Why don 't you join Sigma ? You can be with your beloved Miss Borg . Daimon . The righteousness you believe in is here . Which side are you on , Daimon ? What 's happening ? Foolish humans . Sigma will take you out . Go ! Right ! Dragon . Does it hurt ? Daimon . Get Zaborgar . I 'm sorry about before . Change . Zaborgar . Zaborgar , beat up Miss Ruggers ! Brainless humans . Stop . Daimon . What 's most important to you ? Me ? Justice ? Or Zaborgar ? Show me your love . Zaborgar . Take out the police officers . Zaborgar . Move ! What ? Zaborgar ? Shoot . What 's going on , Daimon ? Do it , Zaborgar . What happened ? Zaborgar . Attack them . Fight them ! Move ! Help me . What are you doing , Daimon ? Cease now . Daimon , stand down . Zaborgar . You act of your own will ? Are you trying to stop me from turning to Sigma ? Zaborgar . Are you crying ? How 's it feel ? I wanna taste you ! Daimon . I 'm glad I trusted you . But I have something to tell you . In my body ... Zaborgar . Daimon . Zaborgar ! Miss Borg ... Huh ? By allowing my heart to be swayed , I lost everything . At least , that 's how it felt at the time . But , I didn 't even realize that ... this was just the beginning . To be continued 25 Years Later Oh , that was a scare . Why did you hit the brake so hard ? Idiot Daimon ! I almost hit that old lady . I thought it was righteousness . You 're just a driver . Don 't talk back . You 're fired . Get out ! Please wait . I 'll do anything not to be fired . I 'll strive to improve my competency . It 's 25 years since I hired you after your dismissal from the secret police . But I can 't stand it anymore . Enough ! And when will you stop wearing those jeans ? Start the car . Pathetic . No way ! Jeans are so easy to move around in . Chapter 2 : Hang In There Daimon ! Adrift On The Sea of Life ! It 's been 25 years . Times have changed and so have I. Wakasugi became prime minister and promoted nuclear weapons in Japan . Nuclear plants and missile bases were constructed across the country . It 's become where nobody can stand up against the state . Zaborgar ... Hey ! Daimon , right ? Been ages . We missed you . 25 years , Daimon . Your face has changed . Like a different person . We 've changed as well . Daimon . After you left , we were dismissed too . As Wakasugi moved up , we were left behind . My wife and daughter left me . At his insistence ... we formed The League of Smiles . The League of Smiles ? We keep smiling and smiling no matter what happens ! Right ? Come Daimon , why don 't you smile with us ? But , I ... Them again . Let 's go . Hurry up . I wonder how long Sigma 's abductions will continue . We 're no longer cops . It 's none of our business . That 's right . None of my business . Eyes and a tooth . Just what you 'd expect from the DNA of a genius scientist . After 25 years , it 's finally approaching completion . Right , Akitsuki ? Dr. Akunomiya . How 's your asthma ? You 're not like the former female cyborg . No mistakes or betrayal . I 'm proud of you . Thank you . Dr. Akunomiya . Here she is . This is Lady Borg Akiko . She 's perfect for the nervous system of the Jumbo Mecha . How beautiful you 've grown . As you 'd expect from a cyborg with human blood . When her destructive instinct awakens ... world devastation will begin . What are you doing ? Don 't let her get away ! Akitsuki , don 't be upset . It 's easy to guess where she 's off to . There is but a single possibility . No work ? Isn 't this an employment office ? True . But jobs are scarce under the recession . Besides , you don 't have an address . My office was closed . I got fired . I 'm totally broke . And you can 't wear a helmet when you job hunt . You 'll get rejected wherever you go . You sniveling little ... What are you doing ? I 'll call the police . Police ? I have protected Japan ! You 're calling the police on me ? Who ? You are pathetic , Yutaka Daimon ! That bike ! All that 's left of a vile female cyborg . I heard you two were close . I see you 've been reduced to this . What 's that ? And you would be ? I am Gen Akitsuki . Daimon . I 'm here to use you as a decoy . A decoy ? Not sure what you 're talking about . But , come on ! Off the desks ! Get down ! I called the police . Flying Dragon Triple Kick . Ouch . Strained my back . My turn . Thunder Punch ! Too bright . What is this ? It 'll harm my eyesight . This is it , old man ! Wait ! I 've eaten too many cream-puffs and developed diabetes . I need my insulin . Insulin ? For your information ... Insulin is for when the body cannot control its blood due to diabetes . It prevents blood sugar levels from rising . I 'm okay now . What was that ? I 'm diabetic . Who are you ? I am Akiko . Let 's talk later . Out of my way . Akiko you came just as expected . This is scary ! This place . You recognize it ? I was here a long , long time ago . Was it something like this ? It 's me through the eyes of Miss Borg ! You must be ... My mother 's memory was input into my brain . Father . What did you say ? I 'm the daughter you created together with my cyborg mother . Akiko . Daughter ? Don 't talk nonsense . I ... I was raised in the laboratory of Castle Sigma . I hate my synthetic skin . I 've always hated you for making me . But ... My back . You 're warm . I 've wanted to know human skin by touching you like this . It 's warmer than I imagined . Hold it . If I 'd known Miss Borg had such a function ... Well ... Then , you wouldn 't have loved a cyborg ? That 's a terrible thing to say . This is embarrassing ! I 'm sorry . Wait ! Hey ! Calm down . Father , I 'm scared . I 'll soon lose my willpower . Only the instinct to destroy will remain . What do you mean ? Enough with the soap opera dribble . Akiko , accept your destiny . No ! Akitsuki . I won 't let you have her . No matter what ! All right . Then , I 'm forced to use my trump card . Come out ! Zaborgar ! But how ? We collected the shattered parts of Zaborgar ... and modified him to obey my commands . Zaborgar listens only to me ... as it seems you betrayed him in the past . Surely , I did betray him . Listen up ! Zaborgar , as well as Miss Borg , despise you . That 's not true . Go ! Zaborgar . Stop . Stop ! What are you doing ? Father . You 're not going anywhere . No . Mustn 't connect ! Father . No kicks ! Kicks hurt ! Zaborgar , please forgive me . Can you hear me ? Hello ? Hello ? He can 't hear you ! He 's really pissed off ! Zaborgar . Don 't ! Your hands are oily ... Forgive ... Flying Dragon Wing Blaster . Say hello to hell , Daimon ! Daimon . Daimon . Enough ! Akiko . No more ! You would kill your own father ? Brother ! What was that ? No way . You are the son of Yutaka Daimon . We were born twins . From the same cell . You lie ! I 'm human . That 's right . You consist only of father 's DNA . You 're my son . Show me the evidence . I don 't believe it . Idiots ! I won 't believe it . I can 't believe it . No one saw you come in here , right ? That 's not a nice thing to say . For the past 25 years ... how many people has Sigma rid you of ? In trade , I gave you a tremendous amount of resources and budget . The plan to clear away the foreign bases in the south ... will soon be put into action . Your attacks will be condemned as terrorist activities by the government . Is that fine ? Yes . Thanks . Ridiculous ! What did you say ? World revenge ? You 're just cozy with politicians and raising funds . I believed you saved me as an orphan , but that 's not true . You just hate Daimon and enjoy watching him and his son fight . That 's right . And it 's a great show . What ! If you resist ... the iron symbol on your head will electrocute you . Akitsuki . There is no escape from me . Daimon . Zaborgar brings back so many memories . I 'm sorry to impose like this . It 's okay . With three men crammed in like this ... a beautiful young lady brightening things up is nice . Can we help ? It 's okay . Stop the repairs . I deserve to be hated by Zaborgar . Why ? Neither mother nor Zaborgar hated you . She wants you to make a stand once more . The DNA in my body tells me so . That you need Zaborgar . She wants you to rediscover the enthusiasm you once had . This is why I want Zaborgar to crush me . Why ? There 's no time . I 'm reaching the limits of my resistance . I ... can 't resist anymore . Don 't expose yourself like that . Like how ? Alright ! Let 's check . What in the name of ? ! Sony . She 's in a growth period . Really ? Have Zaborgar destroy me . I won 't let that happen . Then , father ... break me . With this hammer . Right now . Me ? I don 't want to be a homicidal robot . I 'd rather you smash me to pieces . This way , there won 't be any casualties . Wasn 't that something you believed in ? Righteousness ? I can 't just break you . Why not ? I 've become attached to you . I 'm getting used to thinking of you as my daughter . That 's unfair . I ... I 'll become unstoppable . My foot ! You got stepped on by a girl . Lucky ! Think positively . Let 's smile ! I can 't take anymore . Akiko . It is time ... for you to awaken . Akitsuki . Your sister ... has become the greatest killing machine . Be happy . I 'm ... entering into ... Akiko . Prime Minister ! Tokyo 's being bombed . What ? Tokyo ? What ? ! Idiot ! Sigma allies itself with no one ! We destroy things equally . The giant creature that appeared in Chiyoda Ward ... is demolishing the Diet Building and is causing damage ... Akiko 's started destroying Japan . Ta-da ! It 's time for The League of Smiles to take to the field . Nitta , what are you wearing ? Following your example , we 've made costumes so we can fight with a smile . We 're no longer cops . Nobody needs us . But , people won 't mind seeing something like this . Huh , Daimon ? Nitta .. Nitta , give me energy . Like this ? Me too ? Like this ! Smile and fight ! Smile and save . Whoa , everyone is running away . It 's Akiko . That 's right . She 's huge . Okay , I 'll smile and go talk to her . Hey ! Over here ! Don 't do that . Communication is ineffective . Smile and escape . Very scary ! Even in a crisis , I never forget my smile . Matsue ! Hey ! Janine ? Sure , I can talk now . What 's up ? Really ? You broke up ? I think you did the right thing . Uncool ! Today 's high school girls ' radio waves ... are destroying the world . If you believe you 're only worth a scrap of paper , you can confront anything . I was just a narcissist intoxicated by his own pathetic self . Akiko . Zaborgar . It 's dad . Where are you ? You should escape . None of my business ? Hello ? It was at times like this that I wanted her to open up . Nitta .. After I injured my legs in that accident ... I thought I 'd become as useless as weeds . But , being with you ... I learned I could still protect someone special . As weeds bloom ﬂowers we cannot see ... humans make miracles that sprout ... like so ! Lift off ! We 'll do away with reality ! I think we just did . We 're the ones to end this . My daughter . My biggest smile ... Escape . Zaborgar . If you fight with me once more ... you 'll have a change of heart ! Zaborgar . Akiko . You are the new , reborn Zaborgar ! You and I are brothers . We 'll go to hell together ! Change . Strong Zaborgar . Go ! Red signal , an emergency sign . Electricity of anger running down the line . Change . Shoot . Zaborgar . The culprit behind these mysterious incidents is Sigma . Akitsuki . Daimon . I don 't care if your blood runs through me . As a man , I can let you go no further . I see . Though you are my son , you will get no mercy from me . If you try and stop me , I won 't go easy . Fight me . Daimon . OK . Akiko . They 're approaching . The game is getting good . Let me enjoy your father-son battle . Daimon . Father . Akiko . Father , hurry . While I 'm somewhat sane , get up here . Daimon , I 'm gonna knock you to the ground below . I 'm up for the challenge . Black Hawk , go ! Daimon . Wake up . Stay in control . Stay in control . Father , what should I do ? I 'm losing control again . You okay ? Father . Die ! Father . Suffer ! Father . Die ! Father . Suffer . Father . Akiko . Hang in there . Don 't lose consciousness . She 's no longer who you think she is . No ! She can overcome herself . I believe in her . The moment you die , I will forget the fact that I have ... an ass like you for a father ! That really hurts ! Stupendous ! Son lets father fall . Then daughter destroys Japan . Zaborgar , do your thing ! Zaborgar . I just remembered that Strong Zaborgar comes equipped with jet engines . Bastard . Black Hawk . Attack ! Zaborgar , you can take it ! Zaborgar ! Zaborgar . Daimonium Cannon ! Akiko . Shit . - You okay ? Shut up . Black Hawk ! You did it , Zaborgar ! Zaborgar , thank you . Father . The entrance is on the back of my neck . Hurry ! Get Akunomiya . Okay ! Damn it . Damn it ! Akitsuki , my hand . No way ! I 'd rather die than suffer your sympathy . I wasn 't born to live such a pathetic life . This is just what my father said to me as well . What ? Go ... Just leave me . Don 't make me admit my defeat . I 'll respect your decision . It 's all I can do as your father . Zaborgar . Let 's go . Zaborgar . What do you think ? Petit Bulldog Robots . Awfully cute , but terribly tough . They can chew into a robots ' nervous system in the blink of an eye . Akunomiya . I 've been waiting to fight you face to face . Jealousy of my father has tuned into hatred of the entire world . It never ceases . For these past 25 years , what have you done ? You 've only learned how powerless you are . How 's that ? I jiggle my knees ... and out pop knives . You 're right . I did learn how useless I am . But , I also learned about love . I learned that love is hard and tough . You 're just running from the knowledge that you get no love from destroying things . Don 't talk to me as if you know . There 's no one in this world worth living for . Wrong . Though diabetic ... though penniless ... if you keep on trying ... you can fight until the last moment . I 'll never give up , Zaborgar . How 's this ? My jiggling doesn 't give up either !

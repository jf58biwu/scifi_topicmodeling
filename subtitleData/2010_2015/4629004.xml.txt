 1x02 - Power Trip Blastosaurus , let 's see what you can do ! Man , we 've gotta make it more powerful ! How much more powerful do you need it to be ? ! Powerful enough to keep Kane from kickin ' our butts . Too many close calls lately . What we got just ain 't cutting ' it . Okay , what next ? Oh , gotta check out Dutch 's mod on the super charger . It should give us a pretty big speed boost . I think I know just how to use that boost . The Detroit doom jump ? ! It 's the most dangerous jump in Motorcity ! - No one 's ever made it across ! - Yep . And you still wanna jump it ? ! Can 't think of a better way to test out the super charger . Sorry , bro ! Too crazy for my blood ! Yo , Mike , you guys are gonna have to cut the equipment shakedown short . We just picked up an S.O.S. signal , and it 's coming from inside of Kane Co. tower . Inside ? We 're on our way , Julie . Just gotta pick up Chuck . Why ? Where 's Chuck ? Gettin ' some fresh air . If you keep bailing on me like that , I 'm gonna start thinking you don 't trust me . - Well ... - Oh , come on . - You know I got your back . - Yeah , you had my back last time , and things didn 't work out so great . Yeah , but that totally wasn 't my fault . The signal 's scrambled , but we can tell it 's coming from Kane Co . ' s R-and-D department . And before you ask , no , I don 't have access . - It 's way off limits . - It wasn 't off limits back in my day . Heck , when Kane Co. was trying to help people , not exploit them , Abraham and I set up R-and-D together . But that was a long time ago . No telling what he 's up to now . Smells like another trap . Or it could be a real call for help and someone may be in trouble . - Only one way to find out . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - - - Do I have to remind you how important your department 's research is to the safety and security of deluxe ? But , Mr. Kane , we 've been having ongoing problems with the staff , and the device itself is extremely unstable . I want it to be unstable ! That 's the whole point . It 's supposed to take out those Motorcity squatters in one blow ! Yay , Mr. Kane ! Or one blow-up , to be more accurate . - But , sir , the device ... - Is no longer your concern . Ow ! Tooley ! Please tell our friend here about Kane Co . ' s generous severance package . That means he wants me to beat you up ! Yeah , I know . No way . We don 't know what we 're rushing into . Gotta move now , Chuck . We get to bust out the Blastosaurus on this mission ? ! Not ready . It doesn 't have enough power to go against Kane 's latest war tech . None of our weapons do , in case you guys don 't remember . Give me a few more days and they will . I wish I could , Dutch , but if the S.O.S. is real , we can 't wait . At least wait until I finish decoding the signal . Then you 'll have to decode it on the run . It 's a beast . No way we 're getting in undetected . Beast ? ! Beast is an understatement ! Thermo-scanners , laser gates , the works ! This is impossible ! Right . So we go in through the front door . They won 't be expecting that . A quick , direct strike ... take ' em by surprise . Find out who 's broadcasting the S.O.S. and ... And then we run into the lockdown gates . And if that wasn 't enough , there 's a full platoon of shockbots on standby . No sweat . Sneak in through the sewer , bypass the sensors ... And what about the random flushes of the entire system ? No , you both got it wrong , but that 's why Texas is here . Okay , what is Kane 's greatest weakness ? - His ... - His stomach , right ! Yeah , I know ! Dude , we totally sneak in like we 're delivering pizzas , and then we open the box to reveal our cars that have been shrunk down because Texas invented a shrink ray ! - Texas ... - And then I punch Kane ! So what happened to the cars ? I punch Kane in the stomach ! Yeah , Texas ! Hold on , Texas might have a point , and it gives me a great idea . I don 't like the sound of this . Aw , come on , Chuck . Trust me on this one ? Watch your elbow ! See , pal ? We got this . Nothing to worry about . Just a little farther , we 're almost there . Now , if I 'm gonna be punching the bad guys in the stomach , I 'm gonna need to power up . - Texas ! - What 's the matter ? Can 't take the smell of a little muscle mulch ? Ooh ! Guys ! Finally decoded the rest of the signal ! Burners , my name is Dr. Hudson , and I need your help . Kane has gained control of an immensely powerful energy core that could wipe out Motorcity ! Well , I guess it 's a good thing we 're here , huh , Chuck ? Be cool , be cool . Designation A-4312 . Why are you in a restricted area ? Uh , hello , I am a robot . Query not answered . Why are you in a restricted area ? I 'm , uh ... no , you 're the one in a restricted area . A-4312 . You are exhibiting an error malfunction failure and will be escorted to re-manufacturing . Re-manufacturing ? Doesn 't sound too bad , right ? Mikey , it is bad ! It is so bad ! Okay , a little setback , but I can get us out of here . We got everything we need right here . Let 's do a little modification ... Burner style . Punch it ! Take your next right ! Okay , now , your second left ! Whoa ! That wasn 't on the layout ! No problem ! What the ... ? Come on , Doc ! Is this your idea of a rescue ? - Yes , it is ! - Mike ! Oh , it 's you guys . What 's going on ? I thought it was those darn mutant rats again . Oh , yeah , it 's a rat , all right ! Whoa ! Easy there , Jacob . If I 'd have known it was him , I would 've told you to leave him there to rot ! Wait , you guys know each other ? Jacob was my mentor , back in the good days at Kane Co . He left when Kane started pushing us into more dangerous territory . He warned us that no good would come of our work , but I thought we could help people . None of that matters now . All that matters ... is this . They kidnapped my lead researcher and stole the power core ? ! Yes , sir , and we wont be able to manufacture another unless we can get either the doctor or the stolen core back . - It 's sort of one-of-a-kind . - One-of-a-kind , huh ? The core has a unique energy signature . It should be easy to track , even in the dead zone of Motorcity . Tooley ! Time to run down those vermin and find their nest . Release the hounds . You idiots ! You actually built it for Kane ? ! I wanted to provide clean energy for deluxe . I never dreamed he would use the core for evil . I don 't believe you ! And neither should any of you kids ! Hudson can 't be trusted ! And the fact that he built that monstrosity is proof ! Hey , I was fooled by Kane , too . You should go easy on him . You don 't know this guy like I do . He 's trouble ! That 's exactly what Kane told me about you . How do you know he didn 't come here to kill us all with this thing ? I didn 't , but Kane wants to . He wants to use it to wipe out the people of Motorcity in one fell swoop . I need your help to make sure that Kane doesn 't get the chance . I hear you , Doc . Something that powerful shouldn 't be in Kane 's hands . But maybe in ours . Using this thing in any way is crazy dangerous . We don 't even know what it 'll do . Yeah , it 's a gamble , but it could give us the edge we need to defeat Kane . He 's right . You can 't use it . Here , this is a conservative simulation of what could happen if the core were to become unstable . If it were to become unstable . We don 't know . We have to destroy it . What the heck are those things ? I don 't know . Chuck , jam their transmitters . We can 't let them relay the H.Q. ' s location . Already done . It 's definitely Kane . But how did he track us ? I made sure we weren 't followed . Just like I warned you ! He led them here ! What more evidence do you need ? They must 've figured out a way to follow the core 's emissions . I don 't buy it ! I say we lock him up while we take care of Kane ! All right , let 's keep him under wraps until we get back . We 'll figure this out later . Apologies , Doc . Jacob . We 've gotta do something , and quick ! - Look , there 's just too many of ' em . - And they 're too heavily armored . - Chuck , give me the core . - What ? ! Why ? ! - I 'm gonna use it to power the Blastosaurus . - It 's too risky ! You 're not just taking your life in your hands , Mike , you 're risking all of Motorcity . It may be our only chance to survive this . No one will survive this ! I risked my life to make sure it would never be used as a weapon ! Mikey , think about it . What good will it do to destroy the hounds if you 've destroyed all of michigan along with ' em ? What other choice do I have ? Those bots are more powerful than anything we 've got . - We 're out of options . - Maybe it could work , or it could just as easily backfire and destroy everything ! You with me ? Right . Let 's go . Good luck , bro . I hope you 're right . We 've got your back ! Oh , there 's lots of you guys . Cool ! Robot dogs ! There 's too many ! I can 't shake ' em ! Oh , really ? I hope you 're wrong , Chuck . What the ... ? ! Oh , so you wanna play fetch , huh ? That looks bad . The reaction has started . The core is going to go critical . Motorcity will be annihilated ! No ! Doc , it 's way too dangerous ! We have to stop it ! This should buy us a little time , but not much . Got any ideas , Doc ? Well , maybe we could ... no , that wouldn 't work . Come on ! There 's gotta be a way to crack this thing ! Yeah , Mike already did that . What ? Okay , all right . Now , it 's obvious that if we can 't repair the field ... We 're going to have to stabilize the energy output . No good , we don 't have the facilities . Or the tools . But maybe we can siphon it off somehow . Drain it and stop the reaction ! - Yes ! - Yes ! So we need to find a way to burn off the energy before it reaches critical levels . And , dude , we got two minutes to do it ! I am open to suggestions ! Yeah , I 've got an idea . But , Chuck , you aren 't gonna like it . - Oh , boy . - I 'll burn it off in mutt , use it to power up the engine , and kick it into overdrive . - You 're joking , right ? - Yeah , I don 't know , Mike . It sounds like ... - Like a risk worth taking . - You sure about this ? - If you 're sure , I 'm sure . - Thanks , Chuck . Well , there 's no way you 're gonna pull this off without me . Enough hugging . Let 's do this thing ! - Good luck , son . - Thanks , doc . Look , uh ... You know , sometimes people say things wrong and , uh ... I 'm not good with this stuff . Come on , hop in ! Okay , we gotta keep above 512 miles per hour or the core will get too hot and detonate . - You need to drive crazy fast ! - Let 's do this ! That 's the thing that took the electro-blast to the face . I guess it got an energy boost . Let 's give it another . Back off ! Back off ! Back off ! Thanks for the save . We 'll take care of the core . You guys make sure that thing doesn 't hurt anybody . With pleasure . Mike , we need to burn up the rest of the energy fast ! - Hold on ! - Don 't jump ! Okay , okay , okay ! Okay ! Oh , we 're too heavy ! We 're not gonna make the jump ! Well , maybe we 'll make it now ! This is where you get off , buddy ! No way , man ! We 're in this together ! - Just make the jump , all right ? ! - If you insist ! Yeah ! Oh ! We still got one percent energy left , Mikey ! And mutt can 't take anymore ! We 'll make it ! Sorry , mutt . - Man , that was only one percent ? - We made it ? We made it ! Oh , and we saved Motorcity ! Of course we did . What did ya think ? So , uh , you got a plan on getting us home , right ? No core , no scientist , years of planning lost ! Oh , a puppy ! Yeah , it 'll be good to have another old hand around here . Those punks don 't appreciate a fine organic mung bean curd cupcake , but I know you do ! Yo , you okay ? Between your stunts , that power core , and those creepy dogbots , I 'm just happy to be alive ! But I don 't think I 'll be up for your crazy driving any time soon . Aw , come on , pal . Don 't say that . We rebuilt mutt , and you haven 't even seen the new modifications . - Wow ! - Yep . Had Dutch put in a bunch of new safety features . Okay , I 'll keep riding with you . Just ... try to take it easy once in a while . That 's all I needed to hear . Now let 's test this stuff out ! No ! No ! No !

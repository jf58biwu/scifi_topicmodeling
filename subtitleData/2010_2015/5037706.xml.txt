Well , that 's what we 're here to figure out . Listen , we 've got this under control . I 'm sure you 've got other places to be . So we will call you if a prisoner shows up missing . Well , now wait a minute . The warden said that everyone was accounted for out here , but what about in the main building ? We don 't know yet . They needed all hands on deck during the crisis , so they just shut the main building down . They 're still counting . So everyone 's focus was out here . And with everyone 's eyes on the front door ... It would make it a lot easier for someone to sneak out the back . Maybe this wasn 't the actual prison break . It was a diversion . I 'll order a full sweep and get a head count of all the inmates , get ' em going on that " henhouse " thing . I love that guy . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . [ Sighs ] Okay .

If it 's orange and moves , I want to know . Copy , Marshal . This hole was made from the outside , just like the one in the yard . And this ? It 's volcanic ash .

[ Muffled moans ] Damn , I 've waited so long for that . - That 's not Griff . - No , that 's Barton . He 's gonna make sure that we can afford that vacation we wanted . Where 's the thing ? So this is the magic bottle , huh ? [ Gasps ] Don 't open it . That stuff melted through those prison walls like nothing . Imagine what it could do to a bank vault ... Or anybody that gets in our way . Davis is a member of the Third Street Turks- - a crew deep into armed robbery and narcotics . Another turk in his block is this upstanding gentleman- - Adam Griff . Their last project together landed them here in our lovely hillbilly spa and resort . What about Joe Barton ? Bad man- - armed robbery , assault , attempted murder . A former Turk , but after a messy falling out , they parted ways . So Davis escaped with a deserter and not his fellow Turk , Griff . It doesn 't add up . Or maybe Barton was trying to get back in . I 'm having Mr. Griff brought up . He should have been here by now . You know , someone should keep an eye on our marshal . Pete . Pete should stick with him . Dude , what is wrong with you ? Is there something about that guy you don 't like ? No ! No , no , no , no . It 's just that he 's- - you know , and , you know , we don 't really- - Oh , my God . He 's your ex . He is ? He is . Yeah , he is ! I don 't think that that 's relevant . Dude , why didn 't you say so ? Because being stuck on a case with a guy that dumped me is not a dream assignment .

Oh , come on , you know the guy 's name . Steve just told me about him . It 's okay . Honestly , I 'm glad he has friends that stick up for him . You sure you got time for this ? I heard you got two cons on the run . Play nice , Griff . Secret Service here has got a few questions for you . So Barton leaves your crew , and Davis still breaks him out . Why ? No idea . Can I go now ? Seems like everybody kissed and made up . Did the Turks finally learn how to forgive and forget ? Yeah , right . Barton would be dead if he didn 't have- - If he didn 't have something that you wanted ? Information ? No . You 'd just kill him . Money . He 's got some of your stolen cash , and now you 're groveling at his feet to get it . Hey ... Nobody takes our money . So this is about money . But it 's not your money . So Barton 's trying to--to buy his way back in with his own stolen loot . He 's gonna show Davis where it is . Davis was supposed to take you , wasn 't he ? But you got dropped at the last minute for Barton 's big bag of money . I don 't got to tell you nothing . Maybe we should ask some of the other Turks in the prison . Well , that 's a great idea . We could- - we could tell them everything that Griff here told us , and they could just fill in the blanks . I didn 't tell you anything . They 'd probably be very interested to know how helpful Griff was . I didn 't help you . You guessed . I would probably leave that part out . I 'm very forgetful that way . Yeah ?

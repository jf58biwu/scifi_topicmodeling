 Previously on Heroes . And you see what people want . Their desires , their hopes . I got your power . Isn 't that interesting ? I know why you can 't kill . Hiro Nakamura said you 're going to die alone , and it 's haunting you . We all need people who understand us , care for us . - Who is she ? - The love of my life . - Just shows up . - He 's stalking you ? He does seem ... Obsessed ? I had to act to protect you , to get you away from him . BY kidnapping me ? You can never change the past . It 's bad . Always . Everything is connected ! If you wanna change one thing , that 's all you do . I must go back and un-do the wrongs ... I have committed in my life . I 've come back in time to save Charlie . And this time , I will defeat the Brain Man . He 's not crazy . He has a brain tumour . And I think it 's getting worse . There 's something I want you to see . So magical , so beautiful . Just lei me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you right back to California . Did they really think that they were gonna get away with it ? - Forever ? That we would just never find out ? - We shouldn 't have done it . I need time to grieve without being reminded why . Do you want to talk about it ? - About what ? - Life among the carnies ? The death of your father ? I mean , either one of those would be enough to mess me up . I don 't think I 'd know where to start . I think it 's one of those things I just have to figure out by myself . Listen , I 'm not gonna pretend to know what you 're going through right now . But I want you to know that I 'm here for you , if you need anything , anything at all . I have this review-lesson thing . They moved it to Bapst Hall , I have no idea where that is . East quad . Clear across campus . Of course it is . Excuse me , is this seat taken ? You sure you 're feeling okay ? You don 't look too good . I 'm fine . Just thirsty , thanks . Are you okay ? Yes , thanks . How 's it coming ? It 's ready . Now , remember , it will only work in the hands of one of us . Luckily , you have Hiro and Ando now . You sure I can 't change your mind ? I broke a promise to a girl . I need to make amends . Well , then , I guess this is it . In our lives , when is it ever ? Thanks , Mohinder . - Good luck . - You , too , Noah . Well , gentlemen , I guess it 's up to us . Hiro ? Hello , Carp . Adam Monroe ? But you 're dead . - Am I dead ? - That 's for the judge to decide . - Judge ? - All rise . The honourable Judge Kaito Nakamura presiding . Father ? Be seated . What is the case before us ? The World v. Hiro Nakamura , Your Honour . The what versus what ? Hiro Nakamura . You are accused of breaking the Hero 's code . Willfully altering the timeline for personal gain . If found guilty , the crime is punishable by ... Death . Excuse me , is this Professor Yanno 's review session ? Nope . Study group . You ready to brainstorm ? What the hell are you doing here ? I came to learn . How 'd you sleep ? The dress is a gift . - If you want to change into something ... - A gift ? You kidnapped me . Brought me to ... I don 't even know where we are because you won 't tell me . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I never meant to upset you . I 'll take you back home straightaway . What ? What are you smiling about ? Your face . Just now . It brought me back to when I broke your record player . Samuel . You had this one song you played over and over and over . And I was just ... I was just kidding around but I broke the arm . - Remember ? - Yes . - I remember . - Good . 'Cause there 's something I still want you to see . The only thing I 'm interested in seeing is my own front door . But first , let me get you something to eat . And then you 'll be rid of me for good . I promise . This is how it always starts . Breakfast becomes lunch . Lunch becomes dinner . Dinner turns into drinks and then ... I fixed your record player . I broke it and then I fixed it . I know when I 've done wrong . And I know how to make it good . Scotch tape and wire hangers and loads of good intentions . Fine . Something to eat . Then you take me home . Good . Great . He has a brain tumour , in the parietal lobe . The doctors in Japan said it 's inoperable , but ... We may not have a choice . Please , Doctor , he 's my best friend . - I can 't just ... - Wait here . We 'll find out what 's happening . Please help him . It is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly for his own personal gain , and with a blatant disregard for the consequences on the space-time continuum . How does the defendant plead ? Plead ? What 's going on , Father ? You may address me as " your honour . " You 're dead ... This is some bad dream or tumour hallucination . Let the record show that the defendant fails to recognise the authority of this court . This isn 't a court . It 's a diner . Perhaps Your Honour could enter a plea for the defendant if he refuses . I plead not guilty ! Do I get a lawyer ? Even in a diner ... I 'm entitled to a lawyer , right ? Of course . Ando . Hiro ! Hey ! " Punishable by death " ? Mr Monroe , please call your first witness . I know it doesn 't look good . The prosecution calls Kimiko Nakamura ... But don 't worry , Ando Masahashi has your back . ... and Ando Masahashi . Do you know how I would love to kill you ? Listen , - I know you must hate me . - You killed my father . Nathan . Seems like a lifetime ago . But I 'm a little off my game . And you 're going to help me get it back . Says who ? Says this . Your face showing up in ink wasn 't my choice . It 's destiny showing me my desire . - And you actually thought that I would ... - Relax . They told me I need a connection . A friend . I don 't want to be alone , and somehow you 're supposed to help me . I wouldn 't help you if my life depended on it . It 's not your life you should be concerned about . Gretchen Let 's get this over with . You don 't have to hurl Gretchen . I promise that you will see her again , just as soon as you help me answer my question . Here is what I 've been thinking . You and me . We got a lot in common . We 're both adopted . Abandoned by parents who didn 't want us and raised by parents who didn 't understand us . - My parents understand me just fine . - Stop lying to yourself . Both of our dads were cold-blooded killers , which is ironic , because you and I cannot be killed . I get it , okay ? We have a few arbitrary things in common . What is your point ? My point is , they 're not arbitrary , they 're formative . The basic building blocks of our lives . And we have the same blocks , yet here we are , content college co-ed and me . How did we end up so different ? You want to know what the difference is ? You 're a psychopath . Mystery solved . You think this is a game ? This is my life . You 're supposed to help me . Or don 't you care how many fillets I slice your roommate into ? If you 're not going to contribute I 'll just have to take the answers from your head . You 're going to slice my head open again ? I 've evolved way beyond that . Our friend Lydia gave me a much more precise instrument . She could read someone just by touching them . See into the very depths of their soul . Of course her methods were a little hyper-erotic , but what the hell . It is college , isn 't it ? The dress suits you . What 's that ? Strawberry milkshake . Your favourite . That was a long time ago . How about this one ? The last time I crashed in your dorm room , we talked all night . Among other things . You talked about your dream home . That was the tequila talking . " A peaceful cottage surrounded by nature and happiness . " You 're such a romantic . Actually , that 's something I 've admired about you . But there comes a time when you have to realise that you 're never going to have that cottage . Says who ? Can you honestly tell me you don 't look back at our time together with a hint of fondness ? - What 's your prognosis ? - Not good . I wouldn 't normally do this procedure ... Tell me about that day at the carnival , Mr Masahashi . And what happened to the " slushy " in question ? It slipped out of my hands ... And it hit a strange old man . And is that man in the courtroom today ? The witness has identified Hiro Nakamura , who 's clearly and selfishly interfered with the timeline . I object ! On what grounds ? Your Honour , he helped two people fall in love . If anything , it 's a selï¬‚ess act . Is that true , Hiro ? Yes . Two people found love , and no one was harmed . Where is the crime in that ? Just so I 'm clear , on your personal scale of temporal justice , it 's okay so long as no one gets hurt ? Yes . That is my definition . That 's good to know because I believe my next witness is here . Just tell me where she is . Claire Bennet , you 've been holding out on me . What are you talking about ? Why I was supposed to find you . You and I are the same . I am nothing like you . You do exactly what I do . You use this gift , this curse , whatever it is , to build walls make it impossible to actually connect with another person . Like Gretchen . All those memory hits I got from your stuff while I was tying her up have such a different context now . Everything in that room is so full of pauses . What did you say ? Pauses . All these moments so ripe with subtext . " Can I borrow your book ? " " Cut my hand with these scissors . " All these interactions , and you still can 't say the one thing you really want to say to this girl . Heck , you keep this up , you might end up alone forever , too . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I think I do . The indestructible girl who can 't put herself out there to get hurt . What ? No angry retort ? You 're right . You are off your game . You just told me exactly where she is . How many people have I killed ? Hundreds , I suppose . And all of this because of an agreement you made with the defendant ? Yep . He told me if I saved the waitress , I could have the cheerleader and anybody else I wanted to kill . And as long as you saved his girlfriend , you could kill some more . Willy-nilly . Willy-nilly . Seems to me that a lot of people were hurt as a result of Mr Nakamura 's time-tampering . I object ! I was trying to save Charlie without changing space-time ! Silence , Mr Nakamura ! Your Honour , my client was trying to do what was right . Really ? Does this look right to you ? Who is that ? The Cheerleader that Sylar killed . Crap . Tell me again , who else met their death by your hand after Hiro made this deal ? Well , there was her . And Eden-ish . Two Primatech guards . The melty guy . The mechanic . Isaac Mendez . My mother . Some guy named Ted something . And so on , and so on . If Hiro was acting out of nobility , perhaps he should have stopped this vicious killer - before these countless murders ... - Sprague . Ted Sprague . See , saving Charlie wasn 't for the heroic good , it was for the good of Hiro . No . Romantic or not , Charlie was a good person . One more outburst - - Or what ? Charlie was special . The world was better because she was in it . I believe that , I stand by it . Fair enough . Then the prosecution would like to call its final witness . Charlie Andrews . That 's right . I forgot . We can 't bring Charlie in because this world-improving person is lost in time . Now tell me , how did that happen , again ? - I made a deal with the ... - I 'm sorry. you have to speak up . I made a deal with a villain , and he double-crossed me . Right . The prosecution rests , Your Honour . A shake roof , wrap-around porch and a stone path leading to a lake where the sun glistens over the water . - How 'd you remember all of that ? - I have my ways . - I know all the details . - By heart , it would seem . Hard to forget . I was holding you close to me . And the way you painted it made it so real , like it came from your soul . Like it was you . You always know the right thing to say . You have the perfect scrap of poetry in your pocket to ... To what ? The big oak tree in the yard surrounded by wildflowers . And a couple of rocking chairs on the deck to watch the sunset . You do remember . With a fireplace to keep us warm . And a summer breeze to keep us cool . How do you do it ? Every single time . This is so beautiful . How did you do this ? My friends and I can do the most amazing things . Look . There 's your dream cottage . No more travelling now . We 're making a home , a real home . For me , for you . If you 'll have me . Sam . You said you couldn 't join a carnival . But now you don 't have to . There 's no more carriage homes , no more main homes . Just ... Just that . Away from everything . It 's what you talked about . It could be our life . I can 't live here . - But you said ... - I know , I know , I know what I said . It 's just that I didn 't think you 'd actually ... - Actually do it ? - Yeah . But ... I mean ... This dress and the milkshake and ... All of this . This is a fantasy . And I made it come true . For you . No , Sam . For you . This is your fantasy . And it 's beautiful . And I 'm happy for you . But it isn 't me . My life isn 't here . - But I changed everything for ... - Don 't tell me you did all of this for me . Please , don 't ... Don 't tell me this was all for me . No , of course not . Listen , I should get you back home . Thank you for indulging me . - Sam . - No , it was really ... It was really nice to see you again . Gretchen . Gretchen - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . All things considered . I 'm so sorry . This is all my fault . You never should have gotten caught up in it . I 'm just ... I 'm happy you 're here . And that it 's over . It is over , isn 't it ? No . He 's not done ... - Somewhere out in the open ? - No . He 'll be expecting that . He 's trying to ï¬‚ush us out . How do you know ? 'Cause apparently , I get the way he thinks . - Someone 's coming . - In here . So , Sylar , huh ? The Sylar ? Yes . Well , no . Kind of the emo-apologist version . He 's had me trying to figure out what his issues are . Seriously ? How 'd that go ? Pencil in the eye . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Getting used to being all Perils of Pauline . No , not about that . Well , yes , about that , but about breakfast . About sometimes keeping you at arm 's length . It 's cool . Are you kidding ? - If you don 't want to ... - I do want to . I just ... I 'm scared . And I get afraid that I 'm gonna get hurt . And so I use my " specialness " to build these walls instead of jumping off bridges . I suck at metaphors , but what I 'm trying to say is that ... - It 's okay , really . - No . No , it 's not . This guy , Sylar , he sat there and told me that we 're very much alike . And he 's not wrong . And I 'm afraid that I 'm going to end up alone for the rest of my life , like him . And I don 't know how to fix it . Do you want to talk about it ? I like to think of myself as just a girl who happens to have powers , and it 's just one thing in a list of attributes . Loyal , friendly , regenerative ' good skin . You know ? You do have good skin . But when you put the chips down and life gets tough , I hide behind that one label , that one attribute . And I close myself off . No wonder Sylar is so messed up . I can only imagine what having a bunch of excuses could do to someone 's humanity . Maybe that 's his answer . In order to become human again , he has to get rid of all of his powers . Yeah , maybe . Now was that so hard ? You son of a bitch . Where is she ? It 's dinnertime . I imagine she 's right where you left her . You never took her . Like I said , I 've been having a little trouble being myself . Gretchen ? - You 're okay . - Yeah . Of course I 'm okay . Well , some guy stole my backpack , but ... What 's with you ? Nothing . I 'm fine , and you 're here , and you 're all right . Claire , you 're acting really weird . I 'm sorry . I 'm really lucky to have you . And I 'm sorry about this morning . Forget it . You know me . Impulsive Gretchen wants to hold hands , so she does it . I know , and I love that about you . And I want to be more like that . Not be beholden to any label or definition or who I 'm supposed to be . I just ... I want to hold your hand . People are gonna start to talk . Let ' em talk . Talking 's good . In fact , I could use some talking if you still have a sympathetic ear . I , in fact , have two ears . Come on . Mr Masahashi . Please call your first witness . Mr Masahashi . The defence calls ... Hiro Nakamura to the stand . What ? Have you seen " Law Order " ? That always backfires . You have any better witnesses sitting around ? Because I don 't . Mr Nakamura , how long have you known the defendant ? Seriously ? All my life . And what has been the driving force motivating you ? This whole life . To be a hero . Noble and true . And when you discovered your ability , did you rob banks ? Or become famous ? No . I promised to only use it for good . And how has that worked out so far ? I saved the world . Twice . And did you break your code doing so ? No . And did you even break it to save your own murdered father ? No ' I did not . So what changed ? I was weak . And desperate . For a meaningful legacy . So you found yourself a victim of the bad man 's con ? I did . And I found myself leaping from life to life , striving to put right what once went wrong . Objection , Your Honour . He 's reciting the opening to Quantum Leap . Please wrap it up , Mr Nakamura . Yes , I used poor judgement , but despite the sometimes disastrous effects , it was to make the world a better place ... For family . And friendship . And love . And if breaking my code for those things makes me guilty ... Then , I suppose I 'm guilty . So be it . We need to shock him . Give him 200 joules . charging - Guilty . Clear . No response . - 240 . - Bring it up . Charging . Clear . Still nothing . Start compression . We 're losing him . No , Hiro . - Still no pulse . We 're losing him . - Let 's shock him again . Charging . Clear . I want to change my plea . To " guilty If this is the end , then I want to go out with honour . Doing the right thing . I want to go out a hero . Go my son , fight for your honour . Not so fast , Carp . Fight . You can beat this . The Hiro I know never gives up . He does whatever it takes . I 've seen him bend the very fabric of time and space . You 're Super-Hiro ! Him Mother . I 've missed you so much . As have L son . As have I. And I 'm so proud of you for all the lessons you 've learned . The tumour ... I thought I could fight it , that I could beat science ... but I can 't . Mother , I 'm ready to go . No , Hiro . Some things are more powerful than science . Like destiny . So ... you haven 't come to take me ? No . I 've come to heal you . We got a pulse . He 's coming back . He 's rising . Hiro . Hiro ! Something wrong , sir ? Yeah , something is wrong . Am I scaring you ? Do I look scary ? Sir , I just wanted to know ... You don 't think I can see how you 're looking at me right now ? That I 'm different . Looking down your nose at me , like I 'm not good enough . Well , I 'm done trying to change myself for you . Trying to fit into your world , Play by your rules . From now on , you 're all gonna play by mine . - Can I help you ? - Hey . Hey , buddy . How are you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm Gabriel . Friend of Matt 's , 12th Precinct . I 'm sorry . He 's not here right now . Is there any way that you could tell me where he is ? It 's really important that I speak with him . Sure . I 'm sorry . Have we met ?

 ( BIRD SCREECHING ) ( MEN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( SCREECHING ) ( HOOTING IN PANIC ) ( SCREAMING ) Okay , okay . Here you go . And let 's go again . Which one is this ? Number nine ? Yeah , this is number nine . Bright Eyes , we call her . Are you watching this ? This is unbelievable . Oh , my God . - How many moves was that ? - 20 . Yeah , a perfect score is 15 . Doc , what are you giving her ? Hey , give me that video ! Chimp number nine , just one dose . Aren 't I seeing you later ? We are good to go . I 'm going to call you back . Yeah , all right . Thanks . Bye . WILL : The 112 . It works . On just the one primate . One is all we need . Full cognitive recovery . We 're ready . Look , are you sure you 're not rushing this ? I 've been working on this for five and a half years . The data is clear . We 're ready , Steven . All I need is your approval for human trials . For this , you 're going to need the board 's approval . There 's a lot of money riding on this , Will . You only get one shot . One shot is all I need . ( SIGHING ) All right . But I 'll need to see - all the research . - You got it . - And , Will ... - Yeah ? Keep your personal emotions out of it . These people invest in results , not dreams . Okay . Meet chimp nine . Here she is tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower , the object of which is to move the tower from peg to peg , without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block . As expected , she was unable to complete the puzzle at all . Then , we gave her what we call ALZ-112 , a gene therapy that allows the brain to create its own cells in order to repair itself . In biology , this is called neurogenesis . Here at Gen-Sys , we call it the cure to Alzheimer 's . ( ALL MURMURING ) FRANKLIN : Donnie , you get her ready ? She 's got stage fright . Is that what it is ? ( HISSING ) Hey ! Hey ! She is going to break my hand ! Let go . Bright Eyes , let go ! Are you all right ? We 're ready to move on to the next phase . Human trials . FRANKLIN : Here you go , Bright Eyes . It 's your favorite fizzy soda , come on . Let 's go , Donnie . We should have her downstairs already . Okay ? Good girl . Come on out , girl . That 's right . That 's for you . Around the neck , Donnie ! Around the neck . Around the neck ! Jesus ! ( SCREECHING ) Donnie , do it now ! Open up ! Donnie ! I 'm going to sedate her . - No , no , no , no ! - DONNIE : Door ! Get the door ! Bright Eyes ! ( SCIENTISTS CLAMORING ) ( ALARM SOUNDING ) No , no , no , no . MAN : Close it down . Close it down now ! Go get help . Donnie ! Donnie ! Come on . There have been absolutely no side effects associated with 112 . With one exception . For some reason , the chimps ' irises exhibit flecks of green . Actually , we first noticed it in chimp nine . Hence her nickname , Bright Eyes . You will see when we bring her in . ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) MAN : Watch out ! In theory , this therapy can be used to treat a wide range of brain disorders . It is virtually limitless . As are the potential profits , which is why we are confident that you will vote to approve human trials . ( SHRIEKING ) No ! No ! Mr. Jacobs ? Mr. Jacobs , I am begging you . I am begging you not to do this . Look , it would cost a small fortune to run lab work-ups on all of those chimps only to tell me what I already know . That they are contaminated . There are lives at stake here . These are animals with personalities , with attachments . - Attachments ? - Yeah . I run a business , not a petting zoo . Find the most cost-effective way to put those apes down . - I can 't do that . - You 're the chimp handler . Handle it . WILL : Steven ? - Well , that was fun . - They 've taken the 112 . The board have rejected your proposal . They 've chosen to advance other programs . Well , there must be something that you can do . Yes , there is . I could fire you . Believe me , we talked about it . We have five years of conclusive data . Parade all the data you want , you will never convince anyone to invest another dime . ( CAR LOCK CHIRPS ) This drug has the potential to save lives . To bankrupt this company , more like . I swear , you know everything about the human brain except the way it works . ( SIGHING ) Go back to the drawing board on the 112 . Start again in molecular development . Find a way to get there before someone else does . And clean up this mess . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Franklin ? ( SOFT COOING ) FRANKLIN : They carry small . She must have been pregnant when they brought her in . So that 's why ... She wasn 't being aggressive , she was just being protective ? She thought we were going to hurt her baby . Come here . I 'd take him myself , but my brother-in-law works for security . He 'd rat me out in a second . What , you want me to take it home ? I can 't take care of a monkey . - He 's not a monkey , he 's an ape . - Franklin , I ... It 's just for a couple days , until I find a sanctuary . That 's all I need . Franklin , no . Look , this isn 't my responsibility . This is company property . Okay . I 'm going to tell you what , Doc . Jacobs made me put down the other 12 . I 'm done . Be my guest . ( CLAIRE DE LUNE PLAYING ON PIANO ) ( CHIMP SQUEAKING ) - Hey . - Hi . - Oh , you look beat . - Yeah . How is he doing ? Well , he has good days and bad days . Today , not so good . Although , he has been quoting Shakespeare . ( CHIMP SQUEAKING ) Oh , you got a pet . Just a temporary house guest . Oh . Well , it might be good for him . - Yeah . - Good night . Hey , Dad . - Dad ? - Will ! ( CHUCKLING ) Hi . I didn 't hear you come in . Today is the day , right ? You thought I 'd forget . You have a big test today , right ? Chemistry ? Hey , Dad , do you want to see something ? What ? ( GASPING ) What is that ? Is he injured ? No , I think that is a birthmark . " But as for Caesar , " kneel down , kneel down , and wonder . " Yeah , don 't get too attached . He is a cute little guy , isn 't he ? ( FAINT SCREECHING ) ( CHIMP COUGHING ) ( COOING ) Where are my car keys ? - My car keys ! Where did you put them ? - Dad . You don 't drive anymore . I know that . Here , why don 't you feed him ? - Can you do that ? - Of course I can . ( SQUEAKING EXCITEDLY ) Will , look at this . How old is he ? A day old ? Two days old ? Yeah . Well , he is a smart one , isn 't he ? What are you going to name him ? I don 't know . ( CHARLES LAUGHING ) W Â¤ LL : Right away , Caesar displayed signs of heightened intelligence . So I kept him and brought my work home . By 18 months , Caesar was signing up to 24 words . By age two , Caesar was completing puzzles and models designed for children eight years and up . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) At age three , Caesar continues to show cognitive skills that far exceed that of a human counterpart . Home . Home . He completed the Lucas Tower in fifteen moves , a perfect score . I maintain my hypothesis that , A , the green in his eyes indicates that the ALZ-112 was passed genetically from mother to son and , B , that in the absence of damaged cells that need replacing , the drug in his system has radically boosted healthy brain functioning . And , he plays chess pretty well . - CHARLES : It 's my lamp ! And my room ! - ( IRENA ARGUING ) Dad ? - CHARLES : I don 't need you here . - Irena , I 'm sorry . I can 't do this anymore . He belongs in a home . This is no way for him to live . CHARLES : Yeah , and no way to live . No way to live . Now , it 's my lamp . I 'm always ... ( SOFTLY ) It 'll make you better , Dad . ( CAESAR HOOTING SOFTLY ) Shh ! ( COOING ) ( LIVELY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING ) Dad ? NEIGHBOR : Todd ! Come inside for breakfast ! ( GRUNTING EXCITEDLY ) I 'll need to keep track of what I take from the lab . Although , I don 't foresee you needing more than one treatment a month . - Something amazing has happened . - Yeah . I 'll need a blood test , and a scan and the dosage . - You 'll have to be carefully monitored . - Will ... Now if I can sneak some ... - Will ! - Yeah ? I 'm not sick anymore . It was nothing , Dad . Caesar . Where 's Caesar ? I want to see him . Caesar ? Caesar ! All right , he can 't have gone far . Caesar ! Daddy ? Daddy ! Caesar ! - ( CAESAR SCREECHING ) - NEIGHBOR : Get out of here ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out of here ! Hey , hey , hey ! Enough ! Enough ! The hell is the matter with you ? If I see that animal anywhere near my house or my kids again ... He 's not dangerous . - It won 't happen again . - Damn right , it won 't . WILL : Come on , Dad . He just wanted to play . NEIGHBOR : Stay in the house . Daddy 's got it . I told you not to go out without us . Oh , God . It 's okay . How bad is it ? I don 't know . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( CHIMPS SCREECHING ) ( COOING ) He likes you . Mmm-hmm . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon and we can go get a treat . I 'm thinking ice cream . ( GRUNTING EXCITEDLY ) Good idea . You taught him to sign ? Just a handful of things . Basic stuff . What 's he saying ? Nothing . So , when do you think we should come back ? Well , you won 't need to come back because the stitches are dissolvable . I would just say watch out for signs of infection . Fever , redness . Okay . What 's he saying now ? Well , he thinks that you and I should have dinner together . ( CHUCKLES ) I know . WILL : Hey , Caesar . Come on . Good to see you again , Caroline . You coming , Caesar ? So , what 's your secret ? I can 't take any credit . It 's in his genes . I think you 're being very modest . He 's pretty amazing . I think you 've built a pretty good home for Caesar here . - But ? - ( CAESAR GRUNTING ) He won 't stay this way for long . He 's gonna soon grow into a large , powerful animal . Come here . ( CAESAR CHATTERING ) How has he been doing ? Okay . I think . I love chimpanzees . I 'm also afraid of them . And it 's appropriate to be afraid of them . Caesar would never hurt anyone . Hey ! Hey ! He 's happy here . Come on . Yeah , I can see that . Can we at least give him some open space ? Yeah . That probably would be a good idea . I know a place right across the bridge . The redwoods . It 's paradise . ( CHATTERING ) Come on . Come on . Come here . He doesn 't need a leash . He 'll be fine . Come on . WILL : Just to be safe . Come on . CHARLES : Come on , Caesar . This is the redwoods . Caesar ? All right . If I take this off , you cannot leave my sight . I would never find you again . Okay . - What is this ? - What 's he doing ? CAROLINE : I don 't believe that . - What ? - He 's asking your permission . It 's a supplicating gesture . It 's okay . CHARLES : Come on , Caesar . Off you go ! ( CHATTERING EXCITEDLY ) ( CHARLES CHUCKLING ) Look at him go . WILL : Caesar ! CHARLES : Caesar ! - Caesar ! - CHARLES : Caesar ! WILL : Caesar ! ( SIGHS ) There you are . CHARLES : Caesar ? Go on , Caesar . Climb ! WILL : Go higher . CHARLES : Climb ! WILL : Just be careful . Caesar , be careful ! ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Hi . What 's going on , buddy ? You get some love , too . Come on , honey . Is that a chimpanzee ? Hi . ( GROWLING ) ( DOG BARKING ) WOMAN : Come on ! Come on . ( ROARS ) ( WHIMPERING ) WILL : Caesar ? Caesar . Come on . It 's all right . Come on . All right , come on . Let 's go . You getting in ? Caesar ? You okay , pal ? Are you a pet ? No . You 're not a pet . I 'm your father . What is Caesar ? Okay . Caesar , this is where I work . This is where you were born . Your mother was here with other chimpanzees . But she 's not here anymore . So , that 's why I took you home to live with me . Yeah . Your mother is dead . The thing is , she was given medicine . Like the medicine I give to Charles . She passed it on to you . That 's why you 're so smart . Let 's take him home . Okay . Come on , explain it to me . All right . I snuck him out of the lab to save his life . I had no idea that the effects had been transferred vertically from his mother . But since then , he 's been displaying incredible signs of intelligence . I designed the 112 for repair , but Caesar has gone way beyond that . Here is his IQ from last year . Since then , it 's doubled . This is wrong , Will . My father was gone . This drug brought him back . You never saw how bad he was . - He has his life again . - And what about Caesar ? - What about him ? - Where does he fit in ? With me . With us . Listen , I know it 's been hard for you , but you 're trying to control things that are not meant to be controlled . WILL : The 112 works . CAROLINE : Do you realize how you sound ? WILL : All I 'm saying is , this is a good thing . Caesar is proof of that . So is my father . Caesar , eat your food . Dad , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . WILL : Antibodies . His system has found a way to fight the 112 virus so that it can 't deliver its therapy . My father 's disease is going to return with a vengeance . NEIGHBOR : Honey , have you seen the car wax ? CHARLES : It 's a Mustang . ( GRUNTS ) It 's looking great . What did I do ... Stop ! NEIGHBOR : You stop right now ! Hey ! Hey ! Get out of there ! Get out of that car ! What the hell are you doing ? Get out of my car ! I said get out of my car ! I 'm a pilot ! I got to get to the airport ! How am I going to get there now , huh ? Answer the goddamned question ! What were you doing ? ( STAMMERING ) I have a carjust ... Well , it 's not obviously ... That 's it , I 'm done . The police can handle this . You stay right there ! You are going nowhere , mister ! You or your son are going to pay for this ! But I sure as hell am not going to ! This is your problem ! You made the mess ! ( HOOTING ANGRILY ) - I 'm sick of the two of you ! - I 'm not going ... You stay right there ! No ! ( CAESAR SHRIEKING ) ( HONKING ) ( SCREECHING ) No ! No ! No ! CHARLES : Caesar ! Stop ! ( NEIGHBOR SCREAMING ) Daddy ! ( NEIGHBOR WHIMPERING ) No , no . CHARLES : Caesar ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You didn 't mean it . It 's okay . ( SIRENS WAILING ) Hey . Take that thing off of him . Will you take that thing off of him ? Come on . Look . I 'll take him in . Okay ? No , he 's under court orders . You can 't do that . LANDON : It 's fine , let him . Bring him in when you 're ready . - Take it off . - Thank you . Caesar , Caesar , Caesar , Caesar ? Caesar . ( GRUNTING ) Not right now . It 's gonna be okay . Let 's just see what it 's like inside . Okay ? ( GATE OPENING ) Come on , Caesar . Let 's go . Come on . Trust me . It 's okay . Go on . ( GRUNTING ) ( HOOTING ) He hasn 't spent any time with other chimps . We 're used to that . He 'll be a little skittish at first , but we 'll integrate him . You 'd be surprised how quick they adapt . We provide a stimulating environment . He 's going to thrive here . Come on , let 's do some paperwork . Oh , and make sure you lock that door when you come in . ( GRUNTING NERVOUSLY ) ( DOOR LOCKS ) ( CAESAR SHRIEKS ) Caesar . It 's gonna be okay . Everything is gonna be okay . Don 't be scared . You 're gonna stay here now . No . We 're not going home right now . ( SOFTLY ) It 's okay . In our experience , the longer you drag out the goodbyes , the harder it is . Can I just sign that later ? You 'll probably miss him more than he 'll miss you . Best give him a couple of weeks to get used to the place . CAROLINE : Will , we have to go . We have to go home . I 'm coming back soon . Okay ? Just call ahead before you do . DODGE : Hey , over here ! Hey , I can get you out ! Come on . Over here . Come on . Hey . Down here . ( CHATTERING ) ( MIMICS CHATTERING ) ( LAUGHS ) Stupid monkey .

Once it comes through , it 'll take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date . - 90 days ? - Yes , sir , 90 days . - You 'll be notified by mail . - Hang on . Right . Here 's what 's gonna happen . You 're going to go back on your computer , you 're gonna shift things around , and you 're going to get me a date for my appeal this week . You got it ? I can 't help you . All right , then we have a problem . Because I 'm not moving until you do . 90 days , sir . Be thankful you 're talking about court dates . You 're lucky they didn 't put that animal down . WILL : I promise to get him back soon , Dad . Dad ? WILL : My father 's immune system continues to reject the 112 virus , rendering the gene therapy obsolete . His health is deteriorating , and the disease is progressing rapidly . I need a more aggressive virus strain . A faster delivery method . Because at this rate ... ( SIGHS ) I can 't lose them both . I won 't lose them both . Hi . Can we talk ? Make it fast . I 've got a meeting . In the 10 years you 've been running Gen-Sys , how many drugs have come down the pipeline that could save millions of lives , that could change everything ? What are you talking about ? The ALZ-112 . ( SIGHS ) What happened to you , Will ? You used to be the star of this lab . Now you hardly ever show , and when you do , you waste your time and that of your team 's fixating on a drug that , after what happened , is never , ever going to get approved . The 112 is dangerous , Will , and it doesn 't work . I treated my father with it . It does work . You did what ? You did what ? WILL : He beat the disease . Like we predicted . - Bring him in . - There 's been a complication . Well , does it work , or doesn 't it ? My father 's disease eventually outran the cure . For goodness sake . His immune system produced antibodies that beat the viral component , but it will work . I 've already developed a virus strain that I think will be more aggressive . You think ? Just let me test it . You 're wasting my time . There 's more . The applications go beyond the disease . There are indications that show that therapy can improve cognitive functioning , memory quality ... ( STAMMERS ) What are you saying ? My father didn 't just recover . He improved . You mean increased intelligence ? It 's not conclusive , but yes . I want you to start testing the revised 112 on chimps ASAP . - Okay . - I 'll give you whatever you need . Absolutely .
